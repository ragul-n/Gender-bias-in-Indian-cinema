2
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,680
How easy our lives would be

3
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,160
if it's like those in the magazine.

4
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,080
Yes.

5
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,920
I was thinking of quitting this job
and settling down in my village.

6
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,680
Will you take me with you?

7
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,240
Of course. You'll be there always.

8
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,840
I've asked Paul for money.

9
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,920
It'd be helpful if we could
get that savings scheme.

10
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,960
We can buy land in my village with that.

11
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,280
Aren't you bathing?

12
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,880
Oh, I'll bathe tomorrow. I'm already late.

13
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,200
So it's not because you're lazy?

14
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,000
Hey, don't you have to go
for a checkup tomorrow?

15
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes. And I need to buy a cradle also.

16
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,600
You don't remember all these things.

17
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,880
I haven't forgotten.

18
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,360
Aren't you due in two weeks?

19
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,680
So you haven't forgotten, right?

20
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,160
If I work overtime for two days,
I'll get extra money.

21
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,720
We need that money now.

22
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,320
We have to meet the medical expenses.

23
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,760
And we need to buy that land also.

24
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,520
That's why I'm working overtime.

25
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,000
-Shall I go?
-Yes

26
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,080
Oh, I forgot to turn the TV off.

27
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,760
It has become common nowadays.

28
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,680
The Prime Minister of India
is going to address the nation now.

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We have decided that the 500
and 1,000 currency notes

30
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,240
presently in use
will no longer be legal tender

31
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,560
from midnight tonight...

32
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,320
The increase in black money and fake notes
is one of the reasons

33
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,560
for the increase in corruption
and terrorism.

34
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,240
This is the reason why
the central government

35
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,760
has taken this crucial step.

36
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,720
Aren't you going to work?

37
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,400
Do you have cash with you?

38
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,200
How will I have?

39
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,200
Prime Minister has banned currencies
of 1,000 and 500.

40
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,720
How can he ban our currency?

41
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,680
Shall find out
when I get my salary tomorrow.

42
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,560
This is why the poor are always poor.

43
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,320
Dude, get him.

44
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,120
Leave me.

45
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,400
-Here.
-I quit smoking.

46
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,440
Oh, this is usual. Everyone says so.

47
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
No. I've seriously quit.

48
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
Great! Give me that lighter.

49
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,840
No, I can't give this.

50
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,920
She gave me this as a gift
asking me not to smoke again.

51
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,040
Who would someone give a lighter
and then ask you to quit smoking?

52
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,000
Things like this happen
when you get someone to share your life.

53
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,440
You won't understand.

54
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,000
Of course!

55
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,280
Gifting a pair of fish to your wife,
and saying that it's us!

56
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,040
This lighter is better than that.

57
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,160
What plans for tonight?

58
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,360
I'm working overtime tonight.

59
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,040
You're working overtime
the entire month, right?

60
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,200
Take care of your health.

61
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,000
I need to look after the baby.

62
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,840
And there are other expenses also.

63
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,640
Baby hasn't come out yet, right?
You can start earning after that.

64
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,280
Come, let's go.

65
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,840
While giving us salary, will they fool us
by giving old currencies?

66
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,880
We have time till the 31st of this month.

67
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So don't worry.

68
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,640
Why should we worry?

69
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,840
Only those who have got black money
need to worry.

70
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,560
Good that we don't have
a huge amount of money.

71
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,960
Even if we do, we need not worry.

72
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,280
There're ways to exchange it.

73
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,440
Is it? How come?

74
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,920
-Got anything with you?
-No.

75
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,440
Come. It's time.

76
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,520
I knew that you've come this way to pray.

77
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
How can we forget God in our life?

78
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,800
So, will you be coming
to the temple tomorrow?

79
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,360
You've got only two days
for checkup, right?

80
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,320
Today is the last day. From now on,
it's going to be hospital and home.

81
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,200
Can I leave Sachu at your place today?

82
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,480
I have to attend a wedding.

83
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,920
Sure. I'll have company then.

84
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
-Hi
-Hey, come in.

85
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
Can you give me this?

86
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,000
No, I won't.

87
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,400
What if I give you this firefly?

88
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,760
Come.

89
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,080
Sir, why aren't you answering my calls?

90
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,520
Like you said, I've beaten him to a pulp.

91
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,480
Where should I hide?

92
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,280
You assured me
that you'd take care of everything.

93
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,360
I don't have a single penny with me.

94
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,880
Hello.

95
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,960
Hello.

96
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,880
Shit!

97
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,040
Next shift will begin now.
That's why I called you.

98
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,480
Sachu is here.

99
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,520
They must be hanging around
leaving him there.

100
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,560
It's nice to have him around.

101
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,200
Should I ask Paul to accompany you
to the hospital tomorrow?

102
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,800
Why do you have to bother others?

103
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,120
I'll go alone.

104
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,080
Hello.

105
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
I was not scolding you.

106
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,040
-Hey, not that. I was just thinking...
-Time's up.

107
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,760
What were you thinking?

108
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,760
Nothing. Let me report for duty.

109
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,400
I won't call you tomorrow.
Our Director is visiting us.

110
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,920
I'll be busy.

111
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,440
Okay.

112
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,560
Bye.

113
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,240
Shit! You've lost this time, too!

114
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,520
I'm not playing this anymore.

115
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,360
Deal the cards for the next game.

116
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,880
If you lose, it doesn't mean
you can throw away the cards.

117
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,960
There he is.

118
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
Have you brought the cops along?

119
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,200
I'm trapped in this.

120
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
You went all by yourself.
You should pay for it.

121
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,000
Move to some other place for a while.

122
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,160
Where will I go?

123
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,640
Go wherever you want, but don't come here.

124
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,600
I can't take their thrashings anymore.
Please find a solution.

125
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,320
Hey.

126
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,920
I know one journalist.

127
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,080
She's always interested
in this sort of story.

128
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,400
What will I tell her?

129
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,520
Go and meet her.
I'll call and give her the details.

130
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,760
Hey, are you coming?

131
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,160
You want to play cards?

132
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,480
I'm going.

133
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Fine. Go

134
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,160
Simi, what do you know about pregnancy?

135
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,320
I don't know anything much.

136
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,720
I've just read a little bit about it.

137
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,920
It's the first time for everyone.

138
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Even they don't know much about it.

139
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,280
Just say whatever you know.

140
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,160
It's just like in the movies,
you scream loudly,

141
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,640
and the baby comes out.

142
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,440
You're pretending to be dumb
in order to flatter others, right?

143
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,000
Kind of.

144
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,440
Yes. You may leave.

145
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,280
See, nature has planned everything.

146
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,360
So you don't have to overthink.

147
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,440
Our bodies will respond accordingly.

148
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,600
All you have to do is push.

149
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,920
If it was just about pushing,

150
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,240
we could have stayed at home
and done that.

151
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,320
In the past, there were no hospitals.

152
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,360
Deliveries used to happen at home.

153
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,000
Look how happy he is.

154
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,960
Like he has pulled a prank on me.

155
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,080
Sister, are you always like this?

156
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,480
-Okay.
-Shall we go?

157
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,280
-Is it finished?
-Yes.

158
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,240
-Hello.
-What is it? I'm a little busy.

159
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,760
No, wait.

160
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,200
I went to the hospital today.
I bought the cradle, too.

161
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,280
I'm busy here.
Don't call me unnecessarily.

162
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,880
Okay, I was just going to sleep...

163
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,440
Hey!

164
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,840
Who are you?

165
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,480
Why are you here at this time of night?

166
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,200
I missed my bus, that's why.

167
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,560
They are always like this.

168
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,120
They will cancel the trip
if there aren't enough people.

169
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,520
Please, can you give me the phone?
I need to call a friend.

170
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,080
Here.

171
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,960
Hello.

172
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,880
Hello, Anwar here.

173
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,400
Why are you calling me?

174
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,920
I went to Gracy's house many times.

175
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,400
I didn't find anyone there.

176
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,880
Cops are searching for you everywhere.

177
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,440
Do whatever you want.
Don't call me. Just end the call.

178
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,360
Hey.

179
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,280
Is your friend coming to pick you up?

180
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,480
He'll come. You can leave.

181
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,320
-Hello.
-Hello.

182
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,920
This phone's owner
has met with an accident.

183
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,080
I can't hear you.

184
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,520
At Estate Road...

185
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,520
-His condition is very critical.
-Hello!

186
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,160
What happened to Ajith?

187
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,280
Shall we put her here?

188
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,680
It's not safe here. Take her inside.

189
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,280
There was a phone in the car.

190
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,400
Who asked you to take it?

191
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,480
Give me your phone.

192
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,280
This phone alone will do.

193
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,080
Outgoing calls are barred on this.

194
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,800
She is pregnant.

195
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,680
What if something happens to her?

196
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,240
So what?

197
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,760
She isn't your relative, right?

198
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,640
Her body structure is appealing,
even though she is pregnant.

199
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,920
Everything goes ahead
according to our plan. There's no change.

200
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,800
-What's the time?
-It's 4:20 a.m.

201
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,040
Let me go and deal with her car
before it becomes late.

202
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
Aren't you eating?

203
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
Hello.

204
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,120
Hello.

205
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,600
Open the door.

206
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,120
Hello.

207
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,280
Open the door.

208
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,480
Rajesh!

209
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,320
Rajesh.

210
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,520
Wake up.

211
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,840
She's yelling over there.

212
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,840
Where is he?

213
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,640
He'll be there somewhere. Come.

214
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,320
Don't make a scene. I'll talk to her.

215
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,680
Okay, go.

216
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,000
Lilli, we want to know something.

217
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,640
You let go of me.

218
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,360
Let go of me.

219
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,320
Don't shout.

220
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,440
No one's going to hear.

221
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,720
Rajesh!

222
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,520
Rajesh.

223
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,840
Come here.

224
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,080
Who are you?

225
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,920
What do you want?

226
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,320
We want to know something.

227
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,240
When you tell us that, we'll let you go.

228
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,880
I don't know anything. Please let me go.

229
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,520
Lilli...

230
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,080
We don't want to hurt you.

231
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,440
We want to know only one thing.

232
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,280
We won't hurt you.

233
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,200
I don't know anything.

234
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,560
I want to go home.

235
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,920
I want to see Ajith.

236
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,200
What do you want?

237
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,800
Where is she?

238
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,640
I don't know.

239
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,160
You better tell us.

240
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
I said I don't know.

241
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,920
Can't you answer?

242
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,160
Rajesh!

243
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,160
Philip...

244
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,800
Take him out.

245
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,920
Didn't I tell you?

246
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,160
I'm the one who informed you
about the accident.

247
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,760
His body must be lying
somewhere on the road.

248
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,760
Didn't I tell you not to harm her?

249
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,520
If we find that girl, we'll get enough
money to live the rest of our lives.

250
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,960
Money alone won't do for me.

251
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,800
She's pregnant.

252
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,040
So what?

253
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,640
Just turn her around.

254
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,560
Please control yourself until she talks.

255
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,120
After that, do whatever you want.

256
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,960
Don't even give her water.

257
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,680
When she starves,
she'll speak automatically.

258
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,000
Get me a pack of cigarettes
and a bottle of water.

259
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,560
One cigarette and a lime soda.

260
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,600
Let's wait till tomorrow.

261
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,480
I'll call you back.

262
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,040
You didn't buy anything?

263
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,480
There was only a small shop.

264
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,800
They're not accepting the old currency.

265
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,200
Don't you have anything else?

266
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,240
I have only this, and some coins.

267
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,440
Rajesh has money with him, I guess.

268
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
I'll get it from him.

269
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,240
Why did you kill it?

270
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,320
Just for fun.

271
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,200
Didn't I tell you yesterday
to leave it alone.

272
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,360
But I didn't do so.

273
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,520
Then why don't you kill the dog, too?

274
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,800
I will if I want to.

275
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,760
She won't escape from here.

276
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,120
No one's going to hear her.

277
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
No one's going to come for her.

278
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,520
She has no other option
but to tell the truth.

279
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,560
Or else...

280
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,120
She will die here.

281
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,800
She hasn't stopped crying.

282
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,040
She's not going to die.

283
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,120
Do you want to die?

284
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,960
It's better to tell the truth and leave.

285
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,920
I don't know.

286
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,680
Please let me go.

287
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,800
Think about my baby, at least.

288
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,880
I haven't eaten anything.

289
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,320
Why should we be bothered about your baby?

290
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,520
Tell us the truth and you can leave.

291
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,280
There's no use screaming out here.

292
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,960
No need for any lights in this room.

293
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,960
Shut off the lights.

294
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,960
You survive this night first.

295
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,360
We'll see.

296
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,080
Is Gracy here?

297
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,080
Alex told me to come.

298
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,560
Come in.

299
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,400
Is this the time to visit someone?

300
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,360
Aren't you the one who opened the door?

301
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,760
Please sit.

302
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,960
Alex has told me everything.

303
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,639
Anwar, tell me your side of things.

304
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,080
I'm the one who stabbed him.

305
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,880
Well, he's not the first.

306
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,239
But this time, the police are after me.

307
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,360
You have assaulted a retired judge.

308
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,679
You think the police and the media
are going to leave you alone?

309
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,880
That's because--

310
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,199
Just a minute.

311
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,480
This is not a place for criminals.
You don't have to do this job.

312
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,920
This is going to be
sensational news tomorrow.

313
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,679
I can't allow this here.

314
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,880
Please, Manu. Try to understand.

315
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,600
Do whatever you want.

316
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,960
Manu.

317
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,920
Dude, come back.

318
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,880
Just ten minutes.

319
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,160
I'll make her talk.

320
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,200
Stop it and come.

321
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,760
Just come.

322
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,880
My name is Lilli.

323
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,480
I've been kidnapped by three people.

324
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,200
I'm pregnant.

325
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,400
They have killed my husband.

326
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,680
They're going to kill me next.

327
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,760
I don't know where I am.

328
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,280
If at all you find this mobile phone,

329
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,560
please come and save me.

330
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,560
Here, this is your toilet.

331
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,920
I guess you don't need it anymore.

332
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,000
Rajesh!

333
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,880
How long are you going to be like this?

334
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,960
It's your baby who's going to die
if you don't talk.

335
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,960
Do you want it to be still born?

336
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,600
Give me a chance.

337
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,720
I'll make her tell the truth.

338
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,600
Let's wait till tomorrow.

339
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,280
If not, you do whatever you want.

340
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,800
She's pregnant.

341
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,400
What if something happens,
if she's tortured?

342
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,760
What did you think?

343
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,120
That she'd go with her baby?

344
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,280
Are you scared?

345
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,800
Just think about what we're getting.

346
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,680
Your fear will go.

347
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,800
You can't do anything without taking risk.

348
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,320
There's no turning back.

349
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,360
Let's find that girl at the earliest
and get away from here with the money.

350
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,560
So, what about her?

351
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,200
As if you don't know.

352
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,200
You have tea?

353
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,640
Yes, sit.

354
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,920
Sir, tea?

355
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,040
Look at him.

356
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,400
Is he the same guy?

357
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
Let's check.

358
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,880
I said stop there.

359
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,840
Stop there.

360
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,200
Where are you going in such a hurry?

361
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,240
Lilli.

362
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,680
Lilli!

363
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,040
Lilli!

364
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,640
So, what did you decide?

365
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,040
This is your last chance.

366
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,400
After this there will be
no more questions.

367
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,360
Philip, have you seen anyone giving birth?

368
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,920
No.

369
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,680
I also haven't seen.

370
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,520
I guess we can see it today.

371
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,760
Are you going to give birth
so that we can kill your baby?

372
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,120
I don't have a problem.

373
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,080
We'll kill it right in front you.

374
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,080
Mar Gregory's...

375
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,320
Louder!

376
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,600
Mar Gregory's Orphanage, Convent Road.

377
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,800
How far is it from here?

378
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,040
Around one-and-a-half hours.

379
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,840
Let me go there and look.

380
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,440
Give her food.

381
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,400
Once I reach there,

382
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,960
I'll call you if I find her.

383
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,440
You can let her go after that.

384
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,680
Whatever I told is true only.

385
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,400
Please let me go.

386
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,920
If it becomes late, my baby...

387
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,160
All this time you didn't say anything
when we asked politely.

388
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,720
So let me go and see
if you've told the truth.

389
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,000
We'll let you go after that.

390
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,720
Whatever I said is true.

391
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,840
Please let me go.

392
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,560
At least think of my baby.

393
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,640
Shyam, just check
if there's a display for this phone.

394
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,760
Yes.

395
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,000
It will take some time.

396
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,680
It's okay. I'll wait.

397
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,160
Do you have a new sim card?

398
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,000
Do you have an ID card?
We can't activate the sim without it.

399
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,720
Then it's okay. I'll come later.

400
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,640
Okay.

401
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,920
-Please do it quickly.
-Okay.

402
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,200
Will you stop making these sounds?

403
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
I'm already tensed.

404
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,640
I hope he finds the girl.

405
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,360
Let's take the money
and leave this place at the earliest.

406
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,640
Why do you have to be tense?

407
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,120
Let's wait till she gives birth.
We can leave after that.

408
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,000
Go and get something to eat.

409
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,400
I don't think we'll get anything here.

410
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,520
Get it from somewhere,
otherwise she'll die.

411
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,840
His glucose!

412
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,360
Lilli, don't cry.

413
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,520
Drink this water.

414
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,840
-Isn't it 750?
-Yes.

415
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,600
All right.

416
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,280
My name is Lilli.

417
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,840
I've been kidnapped by three people.

418
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,680
Auto.

419
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,560
Go to Company Junction.

420
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,240
Oh, God!

421
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,760
Brother, time's up.

422
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,960
Eat this.

423
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,880
Why do you suffer like this?

424
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,560
You just have to scream.

425
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,880
They'd leave without saying anything.

426
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,480
Boss said not to take
any more customers today.

427
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,520
We've got new neighbors.

428
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,960
Nuns.

429
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,440
Don't you know everything?

430
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,880
We have arranged it.

431
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,400
You won't get anything here.

432
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,760
Mumbai is much easier.

433
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,480
I've paid your boss enough.

434
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,600
Once he finds a replacement, we can leave.

435
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,440
But...

436
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,240
First, it's going to be me.

437
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,800
Don't forget that.

438
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,480
Hey, are you leaving?

439
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,400
I'll accompany you till the junction.

440
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,400
Your boss's shelf is stacked with money.

441
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,040
He must have earned it through her.

442
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,840
Shall we rob him?

443
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,960
What about Lilli?

444
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,480
I've paid the amount he asked.

445
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,080
What else?

446
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,920
I'm going to make money with her.

447
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,680
You're not going to do anything.

448
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,040
You're not taking her anywhere.

449
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,640
She's mine, the money also.

450
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,480
Don't come here ever again.

451
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,480
Listen.

452
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,320
This is the banyan tree.

453
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:49,000
From here, we have to walk further.

454
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,080
This is the lower primary school.

455
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,760
This is where I studied.

456
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,520
If we walk further from here,
we'll reach the temple.

457
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:03,160
This big house was ours,
but my uncle cheated us and made it his.

458
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,080
Forget about that.

459
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,240
This is my house.

460
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,680
Only I live in that house now.

461
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,280
Lilli, shall I take you there?

462
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,160
There's no need to explain so much
to invite a prostitute home.

463
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,920
Our lives are not just based here.

464
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,680
Buy yourself a new chain.

465
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,200
You're not going anywhere.

466
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,640
Sister!

467
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,800
Sister!

468
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,240
Sister!

469
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,680
Who's it?

470
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,120
I'm Sandhya.

471
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,680
I came here to work.

472
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,200
What work?

473
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,320
Cleaning.

474
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,160
Sir said you will teach me everything.

475
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,000
Which sir?

476
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,680
Did he say anything else?

477
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,040
He offered to teach my brother.

478
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,400
Then...

479
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,160
He gave an old car to my uncle.

480
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,920
Sister, do you have this room's key?

481
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,800
I think sir locked this room by mistake.

482
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,120
-Come here!
-Sir!

483
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,200
Child!

484
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,440
Child.

485
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,840
Let go of me.

486
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,320
Child, what happened?

487
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,920
Child!

488
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,120
Sir, please let me go.

489
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,400
Who locked this door?

490
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,320
Open the door.

491
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,400
Child!

492
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,760
Sister!

493
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,240
Keep quiet.

494
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,040
Shut up, otherwise I'll kill you.

495
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:55,960
Child!

496
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,880
Sister!

497
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,800
Child!

498
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,160
Please save me.

499
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,040
Sister! Sister!

500
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,480
Sister! Sister! Sister!

501
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,600
Child!

502
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,800
Let me go.

503
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
Just let me go.

504
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,840
Open the door.

505
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,600
Sister! Sister!

506
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,760
Come here.

507
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,200
Don't hurt to her.

508
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,120
Move back.

509
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,400
She's just a child.

510
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,040
Let me go.

511
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,360
Let her go.

512
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,400
Move back.

513
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,360
Sir, let me go.

514
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,880
Child!

515
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,120
-Sister.
-Don't worry.

516
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,720
Don't worry.

517
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,080
Sit here.

518
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,240
-Do what I say.
-Okay.

519
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,000
I'll return in a moment.

520
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,600
Let's go.

521
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,480
Somewhere far from here.

522
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,960
Brother, a girl has been imprisoned here.

523
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,640
Here?

524
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:57,560
Who told you?

525
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,520
Watch this.

526
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,200
My name is Lilli.

527
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,520
I've been kidnapped by three people.

528
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,280
I'm pregnant.

529
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,840
This might not be here.

530
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,160
No idea, but let's have a look.

531
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,560
Do you know which building it is?

532
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,000
I don't remember exactly.
It's somewhere here.

533
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,040
These are deserted quarters
of an old company.

534
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,600
There are 10 to 15 buildings here.

535
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,520
Let's check it out.

536
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,840
Okay.

537
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,920
Philip! Philip!

538
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,040
Son of a bitch!

539
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,880
Open the door.

540
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,360
Open!

541
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,600
Do what I say.

542
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,120
Open the door.

543
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,480
Open.

544
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,080
Open it!

545
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,480
Oh, God!

546
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,560
Where's my baby?

547
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,480
Tell me.

548
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,400
Threw it to the dogs.

549
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,200
Rajesh.

550
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,680
She tricked us. There's no one here.

551
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,520
Rajesh?

552
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,320
Only you're left now. Come.

553
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,240
I'm coming, you--

554
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:28,920
Ajith!

555
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,040
What are you doing?

556
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,280
Come!

557
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,400
You don't know me.

558
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,560
You don't know anyone.

559
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,640
You've no idea
what's happening around you.

560
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,880
I'll make you speak.

561
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:55,760
The money which you've got
is the blood of your clients and pimps.

562
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,240
Understood?

563
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,000
How many times
have I asked you for that money?

564
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,720
And on so many different occasions.

565
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,640
Didn't I?

566
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,080
But you...

567
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,480
I just wanted to scare you
and get the truth out of you.

568
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,320
But you...

569
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,400
You're the same old liar.

570
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:19,880
Okay.

571
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,120
It's all right.

572
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,440
Nothing happened.

573
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,160
We can fix all this.

574
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,600
Just tell me where that girl is.

575
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,680
I'll leave if I get that money.

576
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,440
You can go and live happily after that.

577
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,360
Is that okay?

578
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,120
Tell me. Tell me.

579
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,160
So, you won't speak?

580
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,720
You won't speak?

581
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,360
I'll make you speak.

582
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,400
If you'd told the truth earlier,
this wouldn't have happened.

583
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,760
What a time for demonetization!

584
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,880
You've killed them all, haven't you?

585
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,040
Good!

586
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,080
You made my job easier.

587
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,960
There is a saying that prostitutes
shouldn't be so stubborn.

588
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,640
Tell me the truth.

589
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:07,800
Where's that girl?

590
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:10,240
Don't you want to know about our baby?

591
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,600
Our baby!

592
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,200
How can I be sure that it's my baby?

593
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,720
Are you sure?

594
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,400
Tell the truth before I kill you.

595
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,000
Where is she?

596
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,640
My baby.

597
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,360
Your baby!

598
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,000
Just die!

599
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:30,840
What?

600
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,600
-I'll tell you.
-Tell me.

601
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,440
-I'll tell you.
-Tell me.

602
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,400
It was a boy.

603
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,080
There's been a new lead
in the Factory Colony murder case.

604
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:34,480
DNA reports and other evidence
confirm Lilli's involvement.

605
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,280
Six months after the crime,
there has still been no arrest.

606
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,560
The investigation will be handed over--

607
