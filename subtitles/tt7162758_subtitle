He has attained martyrdom.

Jai Hind, sir.

40
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,625
- Jai Hind.
- Lt. Col. Rai Singh reporting, sir.

41
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,792
- At ease.
- Thank you, sir.

42
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,750
- Welcome to Sikkim, Col. Rai.
- Thank you, sir.

43
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,917
You will reach Nathu La post
and relieve the 18 Rajputs

44
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Sir.

45
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,792
Col. Rai, you know
Nathu La Pass is sensitive.

46
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,583
Sir.

47
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:22,875
In 1965, Pakistan war,
China threatened to open another front...

48
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:27,542
if we did not withdraw
from Jelep La and Nathu La.

49
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,875
High Command ordered us...

50
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,042
and advised us...

51
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,625
to withdraw from both the posts.

52
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,667
We lost Jelep La, unfortunately.

53
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,750
But Nathu La...

54
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:42,833
I refused to vacate.

55
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,583
Because it's the key to Sikkim.

56
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,250
Have I made myself clear?

57
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,083
Absolutely clear, sir.

58
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,417
I have studied the features and...

59
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,542
it clearly shows that
we do have an advantage in this area.

60
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,583
Yeah. Good, we're on the same page.

61
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,875
- All the best.
- Sir.

62
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,667
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

63
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,625
- And Col. Rai.
- Sir.

64
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,042
I know everything about you.

65
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,625
You like Field Marshall Mont Gomery.

66
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,208
Great strategist.

67
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,500
Hero of the Second World War,
Mont Gomery.

68
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:20,167
Well sir, after the stand you've taken,
I think I've another hero.

69
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,500
I am no hero.

70
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,958
- Jai Hind, sir!
- Jai Hind.

71
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:26,042
Pull.

72
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,667
- Come on!
- Come on!

73
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,750
Pull.

74
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,792
Come on... Come on.

75
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,125
Push!

76
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,417
Pull harder, boys.

77
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Come on!

78
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,917
Pull. Pull.

79
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,920
Bravo. Bravo.

80
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,375
Push!

81
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,125
Pull harder.

82
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:45,500
Come on, push.

83
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,667
Pull.

84
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:48,917
Pull.

85
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,750
Come on!

86
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,000
Come on!

87
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,500
Bravo, boys.

88
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:54,750
Pull.

89
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,958
Bravo.

90
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,542
Pull.

91
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,417
Sir.

92
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,417
I think the 2 Grenadiers are here
to take charge of Nathu La post.

93
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,125
Hold!

94
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,000
Bravo, boys.

95
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,292
- Ever...
- Powerful!

96
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,542
- Ever...
- Powerful!

97
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,042
Bravo, Attar Singh.

98
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,833
I think you will defeat
the Chinese all alone.

99
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:26,500
Daggar sir, I've been serving
in the army for only three months.

100
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:29,333
But you also fought the 1965 war,

101
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:30,667
That's true.

102
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,000
Under the guidance of experienced
and brave officers like you...

103
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:39,375
we won't just stop those Chinese,
but also push them beyond Tibet.

104
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,458
That's more like it.

105
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:44,625
My experience teamed up
with your young blood.

106
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,583
Sir.

107
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:49,292
Now we'll together push those Chinese
back all the way to Beijing.

108
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,250
Jai Hind, Colonel.

109
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,542
Lt. Col. Rai Singh, 2 Grenadiers.

110
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,125
Col. Zail Singh, 18 Rajputs.

111
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:00,351
- CO.
- Please to meet you, sir.

112
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,375
Same here.

113
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,167
It's very impressive, Colonel.

114
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:09,333
I've never seen any CO push
the gun along with his platoon.

115
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,917
- Good.
- Thank you, Colonel.

116
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:17,583
Actually, I wanted my platoon
to know that even I am one of them.

117
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Great.

118
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,042
Come, let me brief you.

119
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,125
Sure.

120
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,167
You must be tired, Colonel.

121
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's sit here and talk.

122
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,000
- Come.
- Sure, sir.

123
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:35,833
So Colonel, tell me about
your instinct of Canterbury, England.

124
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,917
Discipline, sir. Discipline.

125
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,500
They impressed me with their motto.

126
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,833
"Do or Die, Don't ask why."

127
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:47,833
Yeah.

128
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:52,375
Maybe their motto is the reason why the
sun never set over the British Empire.

129
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,958
And of course, I had the honor of meeting
the General Spartan himself.

130
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,375
Field Marshal Mont Gomery.

131
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,375
Such a great thing.

132
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,375
Field Marshal Mont Gomery.

133
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,750
He's the real hero of World War 2.

134
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,958
Yes, sir.

135
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,375
He's my hero,
he fought both the World Wars.

136
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,125
Do you know that during World War 1...

137
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,750
a snipe's bullet
punctured his right lung.

138
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,625
But he survived.

139
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,250
- He survived.
- Thank God.

140
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:29,625
To see another day,
which was the Second World War...

141
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,375
which he won.

142
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,833
Of course, that was destiny.

143
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,875
This officer has returned from Britain.

144
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,250
I guess he's going to be strict.

145
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,917
How can he be strict?

146
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:42,333
He was pulling the gun
with his platoon.

147
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,250
COs don't do that.

148
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,458
I think he's one of us.

149
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,292
You're right.

150
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,917
Brother.

151
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,333
Major Bishen Singh
has arrived as well.

152
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,333
And brother is carrying the platoon's
entire platoons arsenal alone.

153
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,750
Brother. Brother.

154
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,268
Daggar, did you finish
pushing up the guns?

155
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,625
The road is pretty bad
and also full of stones.

156
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,917
But we've made up our minds,
that we'll bring all the guns up hill.

157
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,875
You will never change, Jaat.

158
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,184
Come, brother, let's share the load.

159
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:47,917
No bro, don't you see that
my hands are tied to the RL?

160
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,458
And weapons are a part of a soldier.

161
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:55,167
And the parts of your body
are never a burden.

162
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,125
You must be alert in this area.

163
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,625
In 1965, two soldiers
of the 17 Rajputs were killed...

164
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,708
by deceit by these rascals.

165
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:09,000
Maybe we were sent
to avenge their death.

166
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:13,375
They used deceit, but we will
challenge them and kill those bas♪♪♪

167
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,000
Once war is declared.

168
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,583
There will be war.

169
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,542
And you will get your opportunity too.

170
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:23,000
But you know, Daggar,
a soldier never wants war.

171
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:27,542
Because he knows about
the loss it causes.

172
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:30,333
And another thing...

173
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,250
Soldiers, move ahead!

174
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:37,792
A soldier doesn't fight because
he hates the other soldier.

175
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:45,083
He fights because he loves
the ones he left behind.

176
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,625
Brother, what you said
does make sense.

177
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,000
India-China brothers!

178
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,875
India-China brothers!

179
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,208
India-China brothers!

180
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:42,917
"My, brothers, this is not your land."

181
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,375
"So why are you risking your lives."

182
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:53,542
"Your senior officers are enjoying comforts
and leisure at your government's expense."

183
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,420
"But, what did you get?"

184
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,250
"Did you get compensated?
Did you get a raise?"

185
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,125
"What does your family get?"

186
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,559
- "Nothing."
- Jai Hind, sir.

187
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,167
Jai Hind.

188
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,792
So these Chinese finally
disrupted your sleep.

189
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,333
Let's join hands.

190
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:11,292
Their propaganda actually
disrupted my sleep.

191
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,292
Sir, this has been going on
for three years.

192
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,590
They have even increased
the number of speakers.

193
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:16,792
Which...

194
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,458
- How many speakers do they have?
- 30, sir.

195
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,625
- And us?
- None.

196
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,542
"You're facing such difficult
conditions in this cold."

197
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,726
- Send a word to the Command.
- "But what did you get?"

198
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,518
- Tell them to send speakers for us as well.
- "Sikkim...

199
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,917
- Yes, sir.
- Is not your land, my brothers."

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,833
"Go back."

201
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:34,667
"Enjoy the comforts of your own home."

202
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,962
"Listen to me.
We will take care of your comforts."

203
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:42,542
Colonel, that mountain in front
is the North Shoulder.

204
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,250
And the one on the left
is the South Shoulder.

205
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,393
- Get out. Go back.
- And there's a pass in the middle.

206
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,375
And exactly in front of you
is the Centre Bump.

207
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,375
- What is all this commotion?
- Let's go take a look.

208
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,708
Get out. Go back.

209
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:58,083
- I will show you, you bloody...
- What the hell is that?

210
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,250
Oh my, God.

211
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,500
- Get out. Go back.
- That must be Harbhajan Singh.

212
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:07,167
- Come on. Come on.
- How dare you?

213
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,667
- Stay back. Stay back.
- Go back.

214
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,042
I am telling you to stay back.

215
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,125
Major Harbhajan Singh.

216
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,000
Major Harbhajan Singh.

217
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:21,625
Major Harbhajan Singh, get back.
It's an order.

218
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,958
Go back. Go back.

219
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,500
I said get back,
Major Harbhajjan Singh.

220
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,292
Sir.

221
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:30,875
What's going on?

222
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:37,042
Your officer set foot on Chairman Mao's
auspicious land and has broken International law.

223
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,250
He will never change.

224
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,667
I apologize for my officer's actions.

225
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,125
Okay.

226
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Thank you.

227
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,667
- Major Harbhajan Singh.
- Sir.

228
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,000
What was this?

229
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:56,917
Do you realize that your actions
could've led to a war?

230
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,542
I wasn't expecting anything less, sir.

231
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,708
But why?

232
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,750
Do you remember 1962, sir?

233
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:08,500
How they dreadfully and slyly killed
our soldiers of the Rajput Battalions.

234
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,125
We were posted here for so long.
And now we're also leaving.

235
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,000
But what did we do, sir?

236
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:16,917
Nothing, sir! Nothing!

237
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:22,167
If I leave without taking revenge, then
I will never be able to forgive myself.

238
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,542
And I swear,
my conscience will prick me, sir.

239
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,125
Major, behave yourself.

240
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,542
Colonel. Colonel, please.

241
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,250
Sir.

242
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,958
Major's sentiments
have made our blood boil.

243
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,000
I have a request.

244
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,042
The Rajput battalion you'll be
leaving behind for our aide...

245
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,333
will be lead by Major Harbhajjan.

246
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,268
That's if it's okay with you,
of course.

247
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,375
Sure, Colonel.

248
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,917
If that's how you think,
I am okay with it.

249
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,208
Thank you, sir.

250
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,375
- Major Harbhajan Singh.
- Sir.

251
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,458
You're not coming with us.

252
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,083
You will stay here and help up.

253
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,167
At least look happy now, idiot.

254
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,292
Come here, my boy.

255
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,292
Go get them.

256
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,917
Sorry for the un-officer
like behavior, sir.

257
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,333
But not for the Chinese actions, sir.

258
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,375
You will never change.

259
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,875
Good luck, son. Good luck.

260
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,083
- Buddy...
- Officer.

261
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,750
It's not good to be so short-tempered.

262
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,125
Don't lose your head.

263
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,625
Come, officer,
let me show you the other features.

264
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,708
Come.

265
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,708
Sir, this blast.

266
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:44,083
These people keep making
new bunkers all the time.

267
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:47,375
And these blasts
are for making new bunkers.

268
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,433
I don't think their Intentions are good.

269
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,417
That's why they are
strengthening their post.

270
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:55,958
- Major.
- Sir.

271
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,917
Keep your platoon on high alert.

272
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,250
Yes, sir.

273
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,417
Jai Hind, sir.

274
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,125
At ease.

275
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,375
After studying the features
of Nathu La, I've taken some decisions.

276
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:48,667
South Shoulder will be
Platoon A's responsibility.

277
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,417
Second Lt. Attar Singh,
you will be in command.

278
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,875
Sir!

279
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,958
- Captain Daggar.
- Sir.

280
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,625
You'll be on Centre Bump
with Platoon B.

281
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:00,792
Sir.

282
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:05,000
And North Shoulder
will be under the Rajputs...

283
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:09,042
which will be under
Harbhajan Singh's command.

284
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,667
Sir.

285
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,833
And all the platoon commanders
will report to Major Bishen Singh...

286
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,875
who is Tiger Nathu La from today...

287
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,000
which means Nathu La post
is your responsibility, Major.

288
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,167
Thank you, sir.

289
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,223
You've given me
a big responsibility, sir.

290
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,625
I hope I don't fail the platoon.

291
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,958
Bishen, no guts no glory.

292
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,708
No legends, no story.

293
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:38,920
And we're here to make stories, Major.

294
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,250
This Tiger has guts, sir.

295
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,458
We will achieve glory.

296
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,667
I promise you one thing, sir.

297
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,375
Our Platoon will create history.

298
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,333
- Always...
- Strong!

299
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,833
- Let's take over Nathu La.
- Sir.

300
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,167
Dismiss.

301
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,250
Constable Parashar.

302
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:00,792
Sir.

303
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:03,250
Brother.

304
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,726
- Brother, congratulations.
- Thanks, buddy.

305
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,792
You were always a tiger.

306
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,355
- Congratulations, Major.
- Thank you.

307
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,625
- Sir. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

308
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,792
Congratulations, sir.
Congratulations.

309
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,583
My first order.

310
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,083
Tomorrow... is a day of joy.

311
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,250
Tomorrow... is a day to enjoy.

312
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,125
15th August,
the day of our Independence.

313
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:31,958
The entire battalion
will celebrate tomorrow.

314
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,750
And then...

315
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:38,000
every platoon will build
bunkers on their post.

316
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:39,708
- Any doubt?
- No, sir.

317
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:40,958
- None, sir.
- Good.

318
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,500
What are you up to, brother?
I am having doubts now.

319
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,708
- What?
- Yes, brother.

320
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,595
You could've let us
enjoy our day off first.

321
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,375
But you spoiled our fun
by giving us a task.

322
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,125
Not right.

323
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,042
Buddy, there's a saying in our army.

324
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,583
"The more you sweat in peace,
the less you bleed in war."

325
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:03,917
The more you sweat in peace,
the less you bleed in war.

326
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:05,292
Understood.

327
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,583
Brother, a true Rajput says.

328
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,000
Understood, sir!

329
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,583
"One said, and the other believes."

330
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,000
"Nanak says, both are wise."

331
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,125
Get ready, guys.

332
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,042
We'll celebrate 15th August, come on.

333
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,750
At ease.

334
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,917
Happy Independence Day to all of you.

335
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,833
India is an idea...

336
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,375
worth dying for.

337
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:37,250
On this day,
it wasn't just a country...

338
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:42,583
but a thought,
an idea, an ideal attained freedom.

339
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,042
And many of our brave warriors happily...

340
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,875
laid down their lives for this idea.

341
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:56,750
The culture of our country is greater
than any culture in the world.

342
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,625
Because our culture...

343
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,458
has seen the true image of God.

344
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,875
Every Indian sees the image of God in every
element, every animal, and creature...

345
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:13,792
which we don't see in any religion.

346
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:20,000
So troops, on this 15th August,
we take an oath...

347
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:24,250
that we'll be ready
to give any kind of sacrifice...

348
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:27,833
required in order
to protect this thought.

349
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:31,333
- Long live...
- Mother India.

350
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,333
- Long live...
- Mother India.

351
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,625
- Long live...
- Mother India.

352
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:52,000
"When our platoon marches ahead,
even mountains shy away."

353
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:55,792
"Oceans give way,
and hills shatter to pieces."

354
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:59,708
"When our platoon marches ahead,
even mountains shy away."

355
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,500
"Oceans give way,
and hills shatter to pieces."

356
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,625
"One comrade on the left."

357
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,542
"One comrade on the right."

358
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,333
"One comrade on the left."

359
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,417
"One comrade on the right."

360
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,833
"We never desert our post."

361
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,000
"O Platoon."

362
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,083
"O Platoon."

363
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,083
"O Platoon."

364
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:22,917
"O Platoon."

365
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,792
"We surrender our body
and spirit to you."

366
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,583
"Vande Mataram."

367
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,000
"Vande Mataram."

368
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:37,292
"Vande Mataram."

369
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:16,167
"Sharp eyes, fast heartbeats,
and faster steps."

370
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:20,208
"Even the skies sway
when we march ahead."

371
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:24,000
"Our paths come to us."

372
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,958
"Every destination waits
for us to arrive."

373
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:30,042
"O Platoon."

374
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,000
"O Platoon."

375
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,875
"O Platoon."

376
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,833
"O Platoon."

377
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:41,167
"We surrender our body
and spirit to you."

378
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,542
"Vande Mataram."

379
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,375
"Vande Mataram."

380
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,167
"Vande Mataram."

381
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:48,917
"Vande Mataram."

382
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,458
"Vande Mataram."

383
00:26:56,583 --> 00:27:02,083
"Vande Mataram."

384
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:25,583
What are they doing?

385
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:28,000
Tell them that today
is our Independence Day.

386
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:29,417
So they should also have sweets.

387
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:31,833
Today is our Independence Day.
You also have sweets.

388
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,625
That's more like it.
Prashar, give him too.

389
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,458
Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat.

390
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,125
Jelep La.

391
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,125
We have already captured.

392
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:03,417
Now... we want to capture Sikkim.

393
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:05,625
Because...

394
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:09,000
right now Sikkim
does not belong to India.

395
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:11,708
If we want to capture Sikkim.

396
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:15,250
We... have to capture Nathu La first.

397
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:22,333
But... Indian Army General
Sagat Singh is over there.

398
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,250
If we want to capture Nathu La...

399
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,875
we have to chase away
the Army General from there.

400
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:33,625
Understood.

401
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:36,250
Yes, sir. Understood.

402
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,875
It's really fun when you break stones
or someone's head!

403
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:44,920
- Pandey.
- Yes.

404
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,417
I went home a couple of months ago.

405
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,000
I see.

406
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:50,750
And I saw that a few guys
were eve-teasing women.

407
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,542
They were from our own village.

408
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:54,862
I was really disappointed to see.

409
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:58,000
We stand guard here
to protect our kin...

410
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:59,351
but they are unsafe
amongst their own people.

411
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:00,417
You're absolutely right.

412
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,000
I called out to them.

413
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:02,667
Okay.

414
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,167
I said, "Be responsible, be a man".

415
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,875
But they didn't understand.

416
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,375
And then I...
taught them all a good lesson.

417
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,625
Sir, looking at your biceps...

418
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:18,333
I can imagine you gave them
a sound thrashing.

419
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,292
They must have learned their lesson.

420
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:23,000
What's the matter, Major?
You're doing this job yourself.

421
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,667
- Sir.
- You are a Major.

422
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:28,375
Before an officer,
I am a farmer's son.

423
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:31,357
I spent my childhood playing
in the fields. These are my toys.

424
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,875
You made Lal Bahadur Shastri's
slogan come true.

425
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,000
"Jai Jawaan, Jai Kisaan."

426
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,125
What's the word in English, Major?

427
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,208
Common.

428
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,580
That's the common thing
between soldiers and farmers.

429
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:45,042
They are both willing
to die for their motherland.

430
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,917
Whenever school would leave early...

431
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:52,083
I would run straight to the fields,
to help my father.

432
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,042
And now, even though I am a Major...

433
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,083
whenever I get a leave,
I head straight to my village.

434
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:59,559
Throw my luggage on the ground,
and head straight to the fields.

435
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,833
To help my father. I love doing that.

436
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,542
You see, Bishen sir,
I love the smell of soil.

437
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,375
I must have donated
pearls in my past life...

438
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,375
that I was blessed
with a son like him.

439
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:14,250
He's a Major in the army.
And, he's on leave.

440
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:17,417
But instead of resting,
he's plowing the fields.

441
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,833
He always helped you
in your work since he was a kid.

442
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:26,333
May God bless him with a long life.

443
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,458
And bless him with His grace.

444
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,625
- Son!
- Yes, mother.

445
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:34,000
How much longer are you going to work?

446
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,542
It's time to eat.

447
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:39,708
My dear mother, just a little longer.

448
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:41,059
It's been a while since
I got this chance.

449
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,958
Come on. Come on.

450
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:06,542
Look, here comes our neighbor.

451
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,708
Come, Harjot.

452
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,750
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

453
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,833
- You came at the right time.
- Really?

454
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,167
What are you two
looking at so keenly?

455
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,292
Dear, even you take
a good look at her picture.

456
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:20,333
She is from a rich family.

457
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:22,875
They sent a marriage
proposal for Harbhajan.

458
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:26,292
I really like her.

459
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:29,083
What is your opinion of her?

460
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,833
She looks really arrogant to me.

461
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,625
The arrogance can be seen on her face.

462
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,292
She has an attitude.

463
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:42,667
And she must be as tall as me.

464
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:46,667
No, dear. No one in our village
is as tall as you.

465
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,542
What does Harbhajan say?

466
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:52,125
Does he like her? Did he say yes?

467
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:53,667
He will.

468
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,875
He says he wants time to think.

469
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I see...

470
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,583
Where is Major sir?

471
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,000
On the banks of the stream.

472
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,500
I see...
I will convince him.

473
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:08,083
She will make things easier for us.

474
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,625
Even I think so.

475
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:16,125
"I accepted life as it came."

476
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,542
Why are you so worked up?

477
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,958
Where is the fire?

478
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,500
You're dead, Major.

479
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:25,143
I heard that Major received
a marriage proposal from a rich girl.

480
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,625
Mom will get me killed.

481
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,250
But I haven't said yes yet.

482
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:32,333
Your parents say
that you are thinking.

483
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,417
I said that because otherwise,
my mother would stop feeding me.

484
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,833
I said, "I will think about it".

485
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,920
Remember Major, if you say yes...

486
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,667
then I will push you into the river
and then jump in myself.

487
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,042
- End of story.
- Listen.

488
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,855
Don't talk about committing suicide,
you have a very long life.

489
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,167
But not me...

490
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Who knows which enemy
bullet has my name on it...

491
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:52,708
God Forbid if that ever happens...

492
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:55,167
then he'll have to go through
me to get to you.

493
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,833
Oh my, Mrs. Harbhajan Singh.

494
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:05,625
I know that you know
what kind of girl I like.

495
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,917
That's why you're being so arrogant.

496
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:11,042
But I don't like you at all, Major.

497
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:12,500
You don't

498
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:13,625
- No.
- Not at all?

499
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,458
- No.
- Okay.

500
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,625
I am crazy about you. Crazy...

501
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:20,917
You are my life.

502
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,333
My heart beats only for you.

503
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:27,167
- I see...
- I will do as you say.

504
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,695
But you must do one thing for me.

505
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,167
What?

506
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,208
Keep a picture of me in your purse.

507
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,208
Okay, I will.

508
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,792
I will keep a picture
of you near my heart.

509
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,917
At least give me a hug now.

510
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,542
God save me.

511
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:52,167
Bishen Sir, she threw the girl's picture
in the stream.

512
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:56,583
But I have treasured Harjot's memories
and kept them in my heart.

513
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,218
- What is this commotion?
- Chinese movement.

514
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,542
The Chinese are back again.

515
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,792
Come on...

516
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,625
Alert!

517
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,500
Alert!

518
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,833
Alert!

519
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,750
Attar, what's wrong with them?

520
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,542
We offered them, sweets, yesterday.

521
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,417
How did their mood get so bitter?

522
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,667
Those sweets became stale
and bitter back in 1962.

523
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,235
Feels like just yesterday, when...

524
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,042
they shouted slogans of
"India-China brothers"...

525
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:51,208
and stabbed our comrades in the back.

526
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:54,000
This is not 1962, this is 1967.

527
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:58,083
And with God's grace, this time
we will take revenge for our martyrs.

528
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:01,292
- Ever...
- Powerful!

529
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:03,083
Powerful!

530
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,500
Powerful!

531
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,000
Powerful!

532
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,125
Daggar

533
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,958
- Jai Hind, sir!
- What's wrong with them?

534
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:19,667
Tell our soldiers
to be ready for action.

535
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,042
Sir!

536
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,875
Troops, be ready for action.

537
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,417
What's going on here?

538
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:39,958
Tiger Nathu La.

539
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:40,792
Sir.

540
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,042
My fears came through.

541
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,750
This is exactly what I feared.

542
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:47,542
They have started their movement.

543
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,833
It's nothing, sir.

544
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,320
They are just trying to scare us.

545
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,000
They used the same tactics with
my battalion in the past three years.

546
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,375
Constable Parashar.

547
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,625
Sir.

548
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,708
Ask them what they want?

549
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,792
What do you want?

550
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:10,625
We want to welcome all of you.

551
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:14,417
Sir, he says that he wants
to welcome our new platoon.

552
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:15,583
I see.

553
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:16,750
With guns!

554
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:24,750
You want to welcome us
with guns and cannons!

555
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:29,500
Guns down!

556
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,750
Welcome.

557
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:39,792
India-China brothers

558
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,583
India-China brothers

559
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,708
India-China brothers

560
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,083
Let's go.

561
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:00,917
- Tiger.
- Sir.

562
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,875
All platoon commanders to report.

563
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:06,625
All platoon commanders will report
to CO sir in the roundhouse.

564
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:07,708
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

565
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:08,458
Company dismissed.

566
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:09,542
Sir.

567
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,542
I understand the tactics
of these Chinese.

568
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,167
Listen carefully.

569
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:30,583
Their Mao wrote a book.

570
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,875
The book is called "Little Red Book".

571
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:35,750
I read this book in England.

572
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:41,208
The book contains tactics
that can be used against your enemy.

573
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:45,583
And today these Chinese
are using the same tactics on us.

574
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,000
For example, mental pressure.

575
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,417
Provocation.

576
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:53,625
This is a psychological warfare.

577
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,458
They want to scare us.

578
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:01,083
They think that we're still scared
over the 1962 war.

579
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:02,413
But that's not true, right?

580
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:03,458
Yes, sir!

581
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:07,042
Good.

582
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:14,167
So now we must do something
so that these Chinese are scared of us.

583
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,833
Are you ready?

584
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:16,917
Yes, sir.

585
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:20,667
- All okay, brother?
- Yes, all okay.

586
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,958
I think Major sir has got a letter.

587
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:39,875
Brother!

588
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
There you are, brother. I guess
sister-in-law sent a letter for you.

589
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,583
Soldiers eagerly await
only two things.

590
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,583
The enemy's bullet,
and a letter from home.

591
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,962
And I completely forgot to thank you.

592
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:53,500
The wedding was very grand.

593
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,226
Even your sister-in-law is saying...

594
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,184
"Tell my loving brother-in-law whether
he's ever going to get married..."

595
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,375
"or spend the rest of his life
in the bunker?"

596
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That doesn't sound like
sister-in-law's words.

597
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,553
Sounds more like
it's coming from a soldier.

598
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:07,083
- Your sister-in-law has written this, read it yourself.
- No!

599
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:10,500
I...

600
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:13,000
I got engaged.

601
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,542
And you didn't tell me?

602
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,667
And soon I'll get married as well.

603
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,667
But, not without you two.

604
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,893
You two must attend my wedding.

605
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:21,875
Who else is going
to make the arrangements?

606
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:23,917
- Tell me something.
- Yes.

607
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,167
Did you meet the bride to be or not?

608
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:31,500
We did meet, and I even took her out
after our engagement.

609
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:35,583
Come.

610
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,583
Just a minute.

611
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:42,000
This way.

612
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,458
What is this place, Captain sir?

613
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:57,125
You see, our families congratulated
each other, but forgot all about us.

614
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,208
This isn't right.

615
00:39:58,292 --> 00:39:59,750
Tell me, is this right?

616
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,875
So I thought why don't we congratulate
each other instead.

617
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:04,292
What?

618
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:06,393
I mean what can be better than
jaggery to congratulate each other.

619
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:06,962
Right?

620
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,208
Uncle, give me some jaggery.

621
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:10,000
- Give them some jaggery.
- And hurry up.

622
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:11,458
Do you want some water?

623
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,792
- No!
- I'll have the jaggery.

624
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:14,893
- Okay.
- Here you go, sir.

625
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:16,208
Here's the jaggery.

626
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,708
Here you go.

627
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,542
Please. This is a nice spot.

628
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Yes.

629
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,000
Thank you.

630
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,042
You're seriously engrossed
in eating jaggery.

631
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:07,000
This was just an excuse
to know you better.

632
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:09,000
I knew it...

633
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:12,292
- that this was just an excuse.
- Did you?

634
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:13,833
But how?

635
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,542
When you adorned
this ring on my finger...

636
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,417
Oh God!

637
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,292
And pressed my hand.

638
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:22,167
I knew...

639
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:33,000
Well, ...tell me something about yourself.

640
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:36,917
There is no me anymore.

641
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:41,333
From now on it's just us.

642
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:45,583
Now your choice is my choice.

643
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,833
Do you watch films?

644
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
No.

645
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:59,375
In our family,
girls are not allowed to see films.

646
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,667
You're not.

647
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:01,708
I see...

648
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:03,458
But I love watching films.

649
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,000
Let's go watch a film.

650
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:15,750
We're not allowed to watch films
before the wedding.

651
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,875
Just say yes.

652
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:21,208
I'll talk to my brother
and get permission from your family.

653
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,500
And you know,
a new film released this Friday.

654
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:24,667
"Usne Kaha Tha."

655
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,417
It's about the army.
Let's go watch it.

656
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:28,833
No. Never.

657
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:33,000
If it's in the army,
then they will show war.

658
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:36,000
And I will feel like
you are being attacked.

659
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,125
No. I won't be able to watch it.

660
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,125
Then you must definitely watch it.

661
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:43,833
Because you will know
the lives of soldiers.

662
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:45,542
How we fight the war.

663
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,851
Can I ask you a question, Captain sir?

664
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:49,875
Yes, sir.

665
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:52,417
Do you love your country more or me?

666
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:55,833
Look, madam

667
00:42:57,292 --> 00:42:59,417
you're comparing
yourself with Mother.

668
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:03,583
This land is my mother.

669
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,417
As long mother exist,
we exist, you exist.

670
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,875
And I will protect you
till my last breath.

671
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,458
Don't talk about dying.

672
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:27,292
Just be with me for the rest
of my life and protect me.

673
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,583
I see.

674
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:31,875
So tell me...

675
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,250
what are you going to do?

676
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:35,792
Me.

677
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:39,958
I will shower my love on you
which is sweeter than this jaggery.

678
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:44,208
Then do it now, in the fields.

679
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,208
You are so shameless, Captain sir.

680
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:48,917
You must be patient.

681
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,500
Because you can get this love
only after the wedding.

682
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:55,000
Imagine we're already married.

683
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:57,583
So how about some love...

684
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:00,208
I mean it will be really nice, if...

685
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:04,542
In the fields.

686
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,333
Sorry...

687
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:09,167
She was embarrassed.

688
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,417
And brother, I have a small request.

689
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:14,000
When we have children,...

690
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,976
we'll get them married
and become relatives...

691
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,458
Put on the brakes, Jatt.

692
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,750
Slow down.

693
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:21,208
Let's have kids first,
let them grow up together.

694
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:22,772
- Yes.
- Then we'll give it a thought.

695
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,542
Before that,
we must take care of the Chinese.

696
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:27,458
- Yes, brother.
- Get up.

697
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:36,500
So, I had a meeting with the GOC.

698
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:38,542
It was a good meeting.

699
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,167
Because he gave me full powers...

700
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:44,875
so I can treat these
Chinese the way I want.

701
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,917
So I have decided, in exchange for the
tactics these Chinese keep using on us...

702
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,708
why don't we explain
to them in our style...

703
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,167
what the Grenadiers can do.

704
00:44:59,208 --> 00:44:59,542
Sir.

705
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:02,667
You see, you have to pay
the enemies back, in the same coin.

706
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,750
Wonderful, sir.

707
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:07,042
Even Major Harbhajan was saying that
whenever a new platoon arrives here...

708
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:09,875
the Chinese use the same tactics
to scare them.

709
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,667
- So why provoke them, sir?
- Why?

710
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:15,708
Really, Major.

711
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:17,458
Why?

712
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:21,167
Just a few miles
from here is Jelep La...

713
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:24,000
which the Chinese
took from us in 1965.

714
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:26,917
- And why?
- To aide Pakistan.

715
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:29,375
To open a new front.

716
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,042
So we need to do this, Major.

717
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,250
Tiger! We must explain to them...

718
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,833
that this is Nathu La,
and not Jelep La.

719
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:42,125
Sir.

720
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:44,292
They already took Tibet.

721
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,917
And now they have
set eyes on Arunachal.

722
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,125
Yes, I know that.

723
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:49,792
So enough tea, boys.

724
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,542
- Why don't you go show them...
- Yes...

725
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:57,792
- What the Grenadiers are made of.
- Great, sir.

726
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:59,583
Go have some fun, boys, come on.
Cheers!

727
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,750
Cheers!

728
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:05,333
Boys.

729
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,208
Our CO sir is a little over-ambitious...

730
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:10,712
since he's received training
from the British.

731
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:13,000
But you must be careful.

732
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:16,708
Otherwise,
our actions might lead to war.

733
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:18,167
- Right, sir.
- Sir.

734
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,125
We will give you cover from here.

735
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:21,750
- Yes.
- All the best.

736
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:24,667
Come on.

737
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:44,250
Let's go. Let's go.

738
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,792
Forward.

739
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:14,542
Why have you come here?

740
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:16,351
Sir, they want to know
what we're doing here?

741
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:20,292
Parashar, tell them that
we're here to hug them.

742
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:22,792
We've come to hug you.

743
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,708
With guns and weapons.

744
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:28,875
Sir, he's saying
with grenades and guns.

745
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:34,833
Parashar, tell them that
this is how we Indians hug.

746
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:36,667
Okay. Okay.

747
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:37,917
Go back.

748
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:39,708
Okay.

749
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,083
This is not right.

750
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:44,208
This land belongs to Chairman Mao.

751
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:46,333
You have no right to be here.

752
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:49,167
Get out.
Or the consequences will be bad.

753
00:47:49,417 --> 00:47:51,583
Bro, what is he blabbering?

754
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:53,375
Sir, he's telling us to move back.

755
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:54,976
And says if we don't do as he says,
then the consequences will be bad.

756
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,167
Consequences?

757
00:47:56,667 --> 00:48:00,375
Fine... then we're breaking
international rules...

758
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:06,208
and I'm putting one foot
inside your border.

759
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:09,125
What is your problem?

760
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:10,208
Wait!

761
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,000
Yes, uncle.

762
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:15,125
You are crossing your limits.

763
00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:18,833
Apologise. And leave.

764
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:21,583
Apology.

765
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,750
Apology for what?

766
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,125
You must apologize to us.

767
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:31,500
For brutally killing
our soldiers in 1962.

768
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:34,250
And you must apologize
for the rest of your lives.

769
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,917
Understand, Chinese.

770
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,417
And we won't forgive you.

771
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:42,750
We will definitely avenge
the death of our Rajput brothers.

772
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:45,708
Why you...

773
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:48,167
Leave it.

774
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,542
About turn.

775
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:14,208
Sir, we just gave those Chinese
a small warning...

776
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:17,333
and they were at a loss for words.

777
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:18,934
You should have seen their faces, sir.

778
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:20,167
It was fun.

779
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:25,042
Parashar, if you want
your enemy to fear you...

780
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:27,625
then you must get rid of
your own fear.

781
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:30,458
And once we got rid of our own fear...

782
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,500
they couldn't believe their eyes.

783
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,000
Let them come now.

784
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:35,917
Absolutely right, Daggar.

785
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:38,875
And this is what makes my blood boil.

786
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:44,208
Because these bloody Chinese
were always cowards.

787
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:46,375
They have just created a hype.

788
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:47,458
Right, sir.

789
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,042
But one thing is proved.

790
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:53,208
They used deceit to do
what they did with us.

791
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:54,792
They weren't brave.

792
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,542
You're right, Attar Singh.

793
00:49:56,958 --> 00:50:01,542
But now we've
assessed and weighed them.

794
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:06,208
We will crush them whenever we want.

795
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:14,917
The Chinese are building
bunkers in our territory.

796
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,208
Inform sir right now.

797
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:18,000
Mahender to Tiger!

798
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:20,792
The Chinese are building
bunkers in our territory, sir.

799
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:21,875
Over.

800
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:32,292
Hey you... you, what the hell is this?

801
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:34,443
This bunker is on a no-man's land.

802
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
- Remove it.
- This is our land.

803
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,360
Sir, he's saying that
he built this bunker in his territory.

804
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:42,417
- Remove this bunker on no man's land.
- This is our land.

805
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,708
This is our land.

806
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:45,962
- Remove this bunker.
- This is our land.

807
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:50,000
- Boys.
- Stop. Stop them.

808
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:52,708
- Stop them.
- Break it down.

809
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:01,250
Our land.

810
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,875
This is our land.

811
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,458
Our land.

812
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:06,917
Hands down.

813
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,042
Stop them.

814
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:10,208
This is our land.

815
00:51:11,042 --> 00:51:14,000
Our land.

816
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:16,000
Our land.

817
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,500
These bloody Chinese
are always up to no good.

818
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:21,792
Take it down.

819
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,375
Take it down.

820
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:27,000
Go away.

821
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:34,125
How dare you set foot on Chairman
Mao's holy land and obstruct our work?

822
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,167
Because this is not your land!

823
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:37,917
This is no-man's land.

824
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,833
And why are you
building bunkers on it?

825
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:42,000
Who says this is no-man's land?

826
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:43,375
This is our land.

827
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:45,750
And who is going to prove
this is no-man's land?

828
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,125
Prove it.

829
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:49,625
- Tiger Nathu La.
- Sir.

830
00:51:49,792 --> 00:51:51,333
Please show Commissar...

831
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:55,167
where is the no-man's land
and the International Line of Control.

832
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:57,375
Come with me.
Come on.

833
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,083
This is our line.

834
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:04,458
This is our line.

835
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:06,458
- This is our land.
- This is our land.

836
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:08,458
You've trespassed on no-man's land.

837
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,042
You're on our land.

838
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:11,917
- You are cheats.
- Please go on that side.

839
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,184
You are a bunch of frauds.
You want to slowly take over our land.

840
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:16,333
- Commissar, this was the borderline.
- This is ours.

841
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:18,333
But you shifted the line.

842
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:20,292
This is Chairman Mao's land.

843
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:24,625
Move back.
Move back you Chinese.

844
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:25,667
Move back.

845
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:26,917
Move back.

846
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:32,125
- This is our land.
- This is our land.

847
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,875
Commissar.

848
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:36,417
You bloody Chinese will never change.

849
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,542
Men.

850
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:44,500
Go back...

851
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:48,583
CO sir, stay back.

852
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:50,583
Stay back, CO sir.

853
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:52,042
Take CO sir away.

854
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:56,375
Stay back.

855
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,833
Daggar, cover sir.

856
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:05,458
Careful.

857
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:07,750
Daggar, cover sir.

858
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:10,875
Don't let them go.

859
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:39,542
Sir, the Chinese built a bunker
on no-man's-land yesterday.

860
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:45,333
As a result, we had a fight
with them and stones pelting as well.

861
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:49,292
Just them, or did you reply as well.

862
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,708
We replied by throwing stones as well.

863
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,500
Unfortunately,
two of our soldiers were injured,...

864
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,101
but the casualty
on their side was bigger.

865
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,625
That's what I expected from you.
Good job.

866
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:02,976
Sir, my observation is that the Chinese
are not as brave as they try to show.

867
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,167
It's just a hype.

868
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:09,208
Don't underestimate your enemy.

869
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:12,750
Their philosophy is that...

870
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,125
When they are weak,
they pretend to be strong.

871
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:18,708
And when they are strong,
they pretend to be weak.

872
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:21,917
I've been enduring them for three years.

873
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:26,167
Back in 1965,
they would threaten me over speakers.

874
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:28,042
To quit Nathu La.

875
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:33,167
Or else we'll face the same consequences
as in the 1962 war.

876
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:38,375
I trust you totally, Col. Rai.

877
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:41,458
Your decision will be final.

878
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:43,167
You have my full support.

879
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:46,000
- Jai Hind.
- Thank you, sir.

880
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:52,000
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

881
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:54,208
- Any movement from the Chinese?
- No, sir.

882
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,125
- Keep a watch. Bravo.
- Yes, sir.

883
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:21,417
Sir.

884
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:22,750
Sit, sit, sit.

885
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:24,920
Why are the Chinese so quiet?

886
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,875
No movement from their side yet.

887
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:28,708
Very strange.

888
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:32,083
So? All okay at home, Attar Singh?

889
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:33,917
- Yes, sir. All okay.
- Good.

890
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,333
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

891
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:39,542
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

892
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:41,292
Jai Hind.

893
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:43,458
What is it?

894
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:46,750
Sir, something is wrong.

895
00:55:47,292 --> 00:55:49,500
The Chinese built a bunker
overnight on the North.

896
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:59,000
Okay, let's go.

897
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:00,667
- Yes, sir.
- Call the officers.

898
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,750
- Yes, sir.
- Come.

899
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:18,667
Look, sir.

900
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,809
This is the section
of the North Shoulder...

901
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:22,875
which the 2 Maratha
Light Infantry had deserted.

902
00:56:23,542 --> 00:56:26,458
Since then, the Chinese have occupied
one part, and we occupy the other.

903
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:27,042
Right.

904
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:29,143
Sir, the problem arose
when we couldn't find the watershed...

905
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:31,967
and demarcation of the International
Line couldn't be done properly.

906
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:34,792
So we accepted this line
as the International Boundary.

907
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,809
And now that we've accepted
this line as the boundary...

908
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:38,643
they built this bunker
so close to the line.

909
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:40,547
These guys are trying
to infiltrate on our land.

910
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:41,250
Right.

911
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:42,750
Your guess is right.

912
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,333
Ask them, why did they come
so close to the line.

913
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:51,375
Why are you building bunkers
so close to the Line of Control?

914
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:55,292
We're building this bunker
on Chairman Mao's land.

915
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,458
Sir, he's saying that they built
the bunker on Chairman Mao's land.

916
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:04,208
Fine, but why build
it so close to the line?

917
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:06,083
Why so close to the LOC?

918
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:07,351
We are building it on our land.

919
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:09,208
We've had enough of you.

920
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,375
Break their bunkers.

921
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:12,583
Stop them.

922
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:13,750
Stop them.

923
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:14,958
Stop them.

924
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:17,000
- Stop them.
- Move back.

925
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,917
Bloody Chinese

926
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,458
Hold it. Hold it.

927
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:24,000
Everyone move back.

928
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:26,625
Everybody get back.

929
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:28,542
Fall back.

930
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:30,625
Fall back, it's an order.

931
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:38,417
Guns down.

932
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,417
Lower your weapons.

933
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:51,000
Okay, build our bunkers
right in front of theirs.

934
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:52,083
Okay, sir.

935
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:56,333
Fall back.

936
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:33,920
We'll build bigger bunkers.

937
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,875
And stronger too.

938
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:39,417
Throw those bags here like
you're throwing the Chinese.

939
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:46,542
Come on, boys, show more power.

940
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,625
We'll eat together. Come on.

941
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:55,083
Bravo.

942
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:57,333
Build the bunker faster.

943
00:58:57,917 --> 00:58:59,542
Build the bunker faster.

944
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,000
- Solider, cover the bunker from right..
- Sir.

945
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:04,792
The Chinese are coming back again.

946
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,250
Stop. Stop.

947
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,375
They are back to trouble us again.

948
00:59:11,542 --> 00:59:15,750
You know what, brother, tell them
that if they try to stop our work...

949
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:18,917
then we'll break their bones
and make Chinese soup out of it.

950
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Sir.

951
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:24,125
If you try to stop our work...

952
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:27,375
then we'll break their bones
and make Chinese soup out of it.

953
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:28,458
What do you want to do?

954
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:31,000
You want to hit us.

955
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:32,000
- Stop them.
- Sir.

956
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,083
Stop them.

957
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:34,625
- Stop them.
- Stop.

958
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:36,417
Stop.

959
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:45,958
Stop. Stop.

960
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,292
Stop them.

961
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:50,583
You bloody...

962
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,917
- Stop them.
- I'll wring their neck.

963
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,962
Stop them.

964
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:57,208
Stop them.

965
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:58,962
- Don't let go, sir.
- Stop. Stop them.

966
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,250
Don't let him go.

967
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:01,667
I'll show them.

968
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,000
Come on. Take that.

969
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:13,583
Come back.

970
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:14,750
Come back.

971
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:16,833
Come back.

972
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,583
Oh!

973
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,500
Attar Singh.

974
01:00:32,792 --> 01:00:33,417
Sir.

975
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:35,875
You finish your work,
I'll deal with them.

976
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:38,083
Come on, Soldiers.

977
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,292
Come on, Soldiers.

978
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:46,750
Stop them.

979
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:54,583
Surround them.

980
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,292
Gyaani played a tactical move.

981
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:01,167
In fact,
he stopped the entire army alone.

982
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:06,583
Go back.

983
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:07,917
Surrender now.

984
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,250
- Then we'll make them run.
- Take them with us.

985
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:14,875
Gyaani is in trouble now.

986
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:16,375
Now he will be interrogated.

987
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:18,750
No, He's Gyaani.

988
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:22,167
I am sure he knows
how to get out of this maze.

989
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:24,708
Take them with us.

990
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:29,625
Come on.

991
01:01:41,792 --> 01:01:43,500
We got time to build our bunker.

992
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:54,125
- Get to work.
- Come on. Come on.

993
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,125
Keep that sack here.

994
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:57,750
Laxman, Surender, get to work.

995
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:22,333
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

996
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:23,625
Come.

997
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:35,750
Where is CO sir?

998
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:38,750
CO sir and the others are waiting
for you at the bunker.

999
01:02:45,917 --> 01:02:47,375
Sir, Attar Singh sir.

1000
01:02:47,792 --> 01:02:50,917
Bravo Attar Singh,
you made it out of the maze.

1001
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:53,292
Bravo, my boy.
Bravo.

1002
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:55,292
Bravo.

1003
01:02:58,958 --> 01:02:59,958
Sir!

1004
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:14,625
You all right?

1005
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:16,417
I am all right, sir.

1006
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:21,167
Well done, Attar Singh.

1007
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,125
A soldier that goes beyond doing his duty,
is worthy of praise.

1008
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,000
That was a good tactical move.

1009
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,833
Now tell me what happened there.

1010
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:38,625
Sir, your guess was right.

1011
01:03:39,292 --> 01:03:41,500
They are preparing for Nathu La.

1012
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:44,000
How can you be so sure?

1013
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:47,375
Sir, there were plenty of
trucks loaded with arsenal.

1014
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:52,292
And a lot of arms activities as well,
which we can't see from our OP Post.

1015
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:58,458
What did they ask you
during interrogation?

1016
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:02,208
Sir, I thought they will ask us
many questions.

1017
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:04,083
But they did no such thing.

1018
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:08,583
They just kept telling us how their
country is stronger than ours.

1019
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,708
And how their cities
are bigger than ours.

1020
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,458
And sir, they also said that
they didn't seize Tibet from us.

1021
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:19,292
It was always theirs.

1022
01:04:20,792 --> 01:04:23,208
And sir, they told me
that if we don't believe them...

1023
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:25,427
then, we can look
at the history of China.

1024
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:26,875
Yes, we already have.

1025
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:29,958
Their maps always keep changing.

1026
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:35,333
They keep adding Ladakh
or Arunachal on their map.

1027
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:38,333
Boys, we've to counter
their readiness.

1028
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:41,363
We will be ready when they come.

1029
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:42,667
- Sir.
- Sir.

1030
01:04:45,958 --> 01:04:47,583
You were amazing, Attar Singh.

1031
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:26,333
- Suraj Bhan.
- Sir.

1032
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:28,042
The Chinese built
a trench on our side.

1033
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:28,750
Yes, sir.

1034
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,542
How dare these bas♪♪♪

1035
01:05:31,042 --> 01:05:32,417
We must inform Tiger Nathu La.

1036
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,500
Yes, sir.

1037
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:36,167
Panther to Tiger.
Panther to Tiger. Over.

1038
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,208
Tiger to Panther.
Tiger to Panther. Over.

1039
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:39,920
Inform Tiger Nathu La...

1040
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,720
that the Chinese built a trench
on the North Shoulder on our side.

1041
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:43,667
Over.

1042
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,625
We will send Tiger
Nathu La on the spot.

1043
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:46,708
Over and out!

1044
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,458
Jai Hind.

1045
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,708
What is going on here?

1046
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:18,333
I controlled my platoon from any
such action that might lead to war.

1047
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:20,958
But you will never learn.

1048
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:24,875
But you people have dared
to dig a hole in our land.

1049
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,542
You don't know
the International Border Laws.

1050
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:32,417
Your intentions and geography are bad.

1051
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:37,542
You're doing this only to start a war.

1052
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:40,958
Sir just give us the orders,
we'll start the war.

1053
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:43,375
And we'll end it too, Major.

1054
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Sir.

1055
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,125
Forward Policy.

1056
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,917
That's what they are trying to use.

1057
01:07:11,792 --> 01:07:16,417
How dare you dig a trench on our land?

1058
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,792
Just like we dared in 1962.

1059
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:21,875
Bloody Chinese,
this trench is just his size.

1060
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:22,958
Should we bury him here?

1061
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,292
Alert!

1062
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:35,500
Back.

1063
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:36,833
Call your Commissar.

1064
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:38,208
I want to talk to him.

1065
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:40,583
Call your Commissar.

1066
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,750
I said call your Commissar.

1067
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,375
- I want to talk to him.
- Stop.

1068
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:45,917
Back.

1069
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,750
Call your Commissar.

1070
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:49,083
Here comes the fatso.

1071
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:54,042
Commissar,
you seem like a reasonable man.

1072
01:07:54,917 --> 01:08:00,583
But we didn't expect you will come
to our land and dig a trench.

1073
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:03,125
Now tell me...

1074
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:07,958
whether these were your orders,
or were they acting on their own.

1075
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:10,833
What are you doing?

1076
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:12,750
This is not done.

1077
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:14,167
This is wrong.

1078
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,625
You cannot do this.

1079
01:08:18,167 --> 01:08:19,333
Stop.

1080
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:24,750
I apologize for my soldier's actions.

1081
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:28,250
We'll fill this trench.

1082
01:08:28,792 --> 01:08:29,458
Good.

1083
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:31,667
India-China Brothers.

1084
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:33,833
India-China Brothers.

1085
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:36,750
India-China Brothers.

1086
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,667
Sir, let's proceed to the trenches.

1087
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:35,167
According to the water-share principle...

1088
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,125
they came inside our territory
and dug this trench.

1089
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:39,208
Excellent.

1090
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,833
I've been waiting for this opportunity
for three years.

1091
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,000
I don't understand one thing, sir.

1092
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:50,333
Why haven't the demarcation of international
borders been done with fencing yet?

1093
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:55,000
We will do it now.

1094
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:56,708
We'll do it now.

1095
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,958
Because the Chinese made a mistake.

1096
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:02,458
Now we will put up the wire.

1097
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:03,708
One thing is for sure, sir...

1098
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:06,750
that God sent our
Paltan here for this job.

1099
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:07,958
- Sir.
- Sir.

1100
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:11,625
I hope we won't get killed,
like in 1962.

1101
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:12,833
Get killed?

1102
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:14,708
Us?

1103
01:10:14,792 --> 01:10:16,292
We will kill them!

1104
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:19,417
And, Attar Singh,
you belong to a brave community.

1105
01:10:19,542 --> 01:10:21,042
So don't sound like a coward!

1106
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,333
Sir, I always prepare for the worst.

1107
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:29,375
Worst, that's the way it should be,
youngster.

1108
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:33,333
If you want the enemy to fear you,...

1109
01:10:33,667 --> 01:10:36,667
then get rid of your fears
and make them fear you!

1110
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,333
Sir.

1111
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:42,667
Now we will do what we should do.

1112
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:45,042
We will put the barbed wires!

1113
01:10:45,167 --> 01:10:46,458
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1114
01:10:57,042 --> 01:10:57,792
Sir, you called us?

1115
01:10:57,875 --> 01:10:58,934
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind, sir.

1116
01:10:58,958 --> 01:10:59,958
Jai Hind.

1117
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:02,198
Tiger, I have big news for you.

1118
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:04,243
Is everything all right, sir?

1119
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:07,652
In fact, things are too all right.

1120
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:09,333
What's the news?

1121
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:14,208
Not like this.

1122
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:19,125
First, you deserve a hug.

1123
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,018
Congratulations, Tiger.
You're going to be a father.

1124
01:11:25,042 --> 01:11:26,125
Wow!

1125
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:30,667
- Thank you, sir.
- God bless you.

1126
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,708
Major! Major! Major!

1127
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:34,417
Congratulations.

1128
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:35,833
Brother!

1129
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,417
Congratulations, brother.

1130
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,042
Thank you.

1131
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:41,458
Congratulations, sir.

1132
01:11:41,917 --> 01:11:44,625
Congratulations, Major.
Congratulations.

1133
01:11:46,042 --> 01:11:47,750
Congratulations is not enough,
brother.

1134
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:49,833
This calls for a feast. Isn't it?

1135
01:11:49,917 --> 01:11:51,917
- Daggar sir is absolutely right.
- Of course, sir.

1136
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,875
- With your permission, sir?
- Of course.

1137
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:55,208
There's a tiger cub on the way.

1138
01:11:58,208 --> 01:11:59,500
This is great news, sir.

1139
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,667
- God bless, Tiger.
- Thank you, sir.

1140
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:03,500
Get back to your post.

1141
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:05,042
- Sir.
- Right, sir.

1142
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,250
Come, Major.

1143
01:12:07,417 --> 01:12:09,333
This is great news, Major.

1144
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,500
Thank you, Karan.

1145
01:12:21,042 --> 01:12:22,042
Rai.

1146
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,458
I am sure your training with the British
must have inspired you a lot...

1147
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:30,250
but don't forget that
they fought two World Wars.

1148
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:34,917
Don't get too gutsy and do something
that will put you in harm's way.

1149
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:44,250
You know, darling, the last thing
an army man wants is war.

1150
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:46,625
No soldier wants to fight,...

1151
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:50,208
because he knows he's the one
who has the most to lose.

1152
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,958
Because he leaves his family behind.

1153
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:57,625
Thank God,
at least you care for your son.

1154
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:01,875
And the country too.

1155
01:13:13,542 --> 01:13:14,542
What's wrong, Karan?

1156
01:13:14,917 --> 01:13:16,277
Why are you standing away from me?

1157
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:17,917
Are you leaving?

1158
01:13:18,917 --> 01:13:20,333
Only for a few days, son.

1159
01:13:20,792 --> 01:13:23,292
You said mom went to visit God.

1160
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:26,500
And she didn't return.
Will you come back?

1161
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:28,042
Hey...

1162
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:34,750
I promise you I will come back.

1163
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:38,042
And don't ever say that again.

1164
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,625
I love you, son.

1165
01:13:50,042 --> 01:13:51,042
Major Chima...

1166
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:54,750
Engineers of 70 Field Company
are being given the responsibility...

1167
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:58,208
to set up catwires
at the Nathu La Pass.

1168
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:00,583
You report to Lt. Col. Rai.

1169
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:10,042
Sir.
Jai Hind, sir.

1170
01:14:10,542 --> 01:14:11,167
Jai Hind.

1171
01:14:11,417 --> 01:14:12,583
Major Shiva reporting, sir.

1172
01:14:12,667 --> 01:14:15,917
70 Field Engineers.
This is Capt. Rahul Sharma. My 2IC.

1173
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:19,003
Good! We've been waiting for you.

1174
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:20,083
Thank you, sir.

1175
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:22,542
That's Major Bishen

1176
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:23,583
- Tiger Nathu La.
- Pleasure.

1177
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:24,208
Major.

1178
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:25,500
Major Harbhajan Singh.

1179
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:26,458
18 Rajputs.

1180
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:27,583
Captain.

1181
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:29,003
Captain PS Daggar, sir.

1182
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:30,083
Good to see you, sir.

1183
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:32,083
Second Lt. Attar Singh, sir.

1184
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:32,667
Good to see you too.

1185
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,125
And he is Constable Parashar.

1186
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,667
Intelligence and our Chinese Interpreter.

1187
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,083
Welcome, sir. Welcome.

1188
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:42,958
As you all know, that GOC sir
has given you the responsibility...

1189
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:45,851
of setting up cattle-fencing on the
international border of Nathu La post.

1190
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:46,625
Yes, sir.

1191
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:48,458
During that time,
Captain Harbhajan Singh...

1192
01:14:48,542 --> 01:14:50,309
- Sir...
- who is in-charge of North Shoulder.

1193
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:52,351
Captain Daggar, who is in charge
of the Central Bump...

1194
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:54,208
- And second Lt. Attar Singh...
- Sir!

1195
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:55,812
Who is in-charge of South Shoulder.

1196
01:14:56,458 --> 01:15:00,583
All these officers along with their platoon
will protect your team.

1197
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:02,042
Got it, sir.

1198
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,583
And also help you put up the wires.

1199
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,417
- Is that clear, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.

1200
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:07,208
Good.

1201
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:08,893
- An important piece of advice, Major.
- Yes.

1202
01:15:08,917 --> 01:15:12,083
As Tiger Nathu La,
it's my duty to warn you...

1203
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,220
that the Chinese pose
a big threat to us.

1204
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:15,292
Understood.

1205
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:20,042
And, always remember that you're not
just engineers, but soldiers as well.

1206
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:23,875
And when the time comes,
you can give a fitting reply to the enemy.

1207
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Of course.

1208
01:15:25,708 --> 01:15:26,792
We will, sir.

1209
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:28,875
Attention!

1210
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:34,292
Sir, with your permission
may I brief them, sir.

1211
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:35,458
Go ahead, Bishen.

1212
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,417
At east.

1213
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:43,250
Brave men...

1214
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:50,750
CO sir has given our company the task of
putting up fencing on the Nathu La pass.

1215
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:54,250
And our company will
fulfill this task.

1216
01:15:55,792 --> 01:15:59,417
The fencing will start
at 05:00 in the morning.

1217
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:01,945
In order to carry out this job...

1218
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:06,625
engineers from Platoon no.
1&2 will carry the source material.

1219
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,375
No. 3 Platoon engineers...

1220
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:13,818
will carry out the task of putting up the
fencing under Major Chima's supervision.

1221
01:16:14,667 --> 01:16:16,000
During this task...

1222
01:16:16,917 --> 01:16:20,542
Captain PS Daggar's team
will give us protection.

1223
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:27,583
And the brave men of Major Harbhajan's
platoon will help us put up the fence.

1224
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:32,792
Our party will leave for
Nathu La pass at 04:00 hours.

1225
01:16:33,917 --> 01:16:35,167
Guys, always remember.

1226
01:16:36,042 --> 01:16:39,125
The strongest walls
are not made of stones...

1227
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,708
they are made of brave men.

1228
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:45,333
The strongest walls
are not made of stones...

1229
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:48,792
they are made of brave men.

1230
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:53,333
- Any doubt?
- No, sir.

1231
01:16:54,167 --> 01:16:55,250
Attention!

1232
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:01,542
Sir, I've given my briefing.

1233
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:03,272
Would you like to add something, sir?

1234
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,750
At ease.

1235
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,417
Brave men...

1236
01:17:13,167 --> 01:17:18,292
GOC sir has given this task to our platoon
because of our bravery and courage.

1237
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:25,042
During this task, the Chinese army
will try to provoke us.

1238
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:31,417
So we must complete
our task with patience.

1239
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:34,208
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

1240
01:17:39,167 --> 01:17:41,375
- Ever
- Powerful...

1241
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:43,167
- Ever
- Powerful...

1242
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,125
- Ever
- Powerful...

1243
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:35,708
Come on. Come on.

1244
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:37,792
Come on.

1245
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:39,292
Hurry up, troopers.

1246
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:41,292
Come on, boys.

1247
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,500
Hurry up.

1248
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:50,875
Come on, boys. Keep working.

1249
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:56,083
Properly. Put up the wires properly.

1250
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:57,917
Sir.

1251
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:09,250
Harder. Harder.

1252
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:14,542
Come.

1253
01:19:20,292 --> 01:19:22,542
Here come the bloody Chinese to die.

1254
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:23,792
Get ready, boys.

1255
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:33,750
- Ever
- Powerful...

1256
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,042
Why are you putting up fencing here?

1257
01:19:57,208 --> 01:19:58,667
The fence is on our side.

1258
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:01,208
Even you can put up
a fence on your side.

1259
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:02,417
We won't.

1260
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,458
Why? Because your intentions are not good.

1261
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:07,018
We won't put up any fence
nor will we let you put up a fence.

1262
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:09,458
No one will stop working.
Those are our orders.

1263
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,125
Stop them.

1264
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:12,417
Stop them.

1265
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,000
Stop them.

1266
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:25,542
Stop. Stop them.

1267
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:27,792
- Stop them.
- Hold the line.

1268
01:20:29,042 --> 01:20:30,208
Stop them.

1269
01:20:32,167 --> 01:20:33,417
Stop him.

1270
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,667
Come on.

1271
01:20:35,792 --> 01:20:37,292
Stop them.

1272
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,042
Major, put up the wire.

1273
01:20:58,917 --> 01:21:00,333
Stop him.

1274
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,875
Stop them.

1275
01:21:05,042 --> 01:21:06,375
Stop them.

1276
01:21:08,042 --> 01:21:09,958
Come back.

1277
01:21:11,042 --> 01:21:12,542
Stop.

1278
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:14,875
Stop immediately.

1279
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:19,417
Come back to our side of LOC. Immediately.
Right now. This is my order.

1280
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,250
Come back immediately.
Come back immediately.

1281
01:22:15,667 --> 01:22:16,833
What is this?

1282
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:18,667
You're putting up a fence.

1283
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,917
But you didn't put up
a fence for all these years?

1284
01:22:21,292 --> 01:22:22,500
What is the need for this now?

1285
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:23,875
But we do, Commissar.

1286
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:26,292
You see our daily fallouts,...

1287
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:32,375
you building bunkers at any spot,
digging trenches on our land...

1288
01:22:32,792 --> 01:22:35,042
or quarreling over the LOC.

1289
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:40,500
So our High Command has issued orders
to put up a fence to stop this for good.

1290
01:22:41,292 --> 01:22:43,583
And you...
You are a smart man.

1291
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,208
I am sure you will agree
with our High Command's orders.

1292
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:49,792
And you can put up
a fence on your side as well.

1293
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:50,875
Okay.

1294
01:22:51,042 --> 01:22:53,625
Even I will talk to my High Command.

1295
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:57,958
And whatever the orders,
or the consequences...

1296
01:22:58,125 --> 01:22:59,485
you should be ready to face it.

1297
01:23:01,167 --> 01:23:03,000
Okay. We will be ready.

1298
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:11,125
- Keep working.
- Sir.

1299
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:12,917
Come on, boys. Keep working.

1300
01:23:13,208 --> 01:23:14,458
And speed up.

1301
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:16,167
Hurry up, boys.

1302
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,958
Indian people in Nathu La
have built a fence.

1303
01:23:23,417 --> 01:23:24,500
Waiting for your orders.

1304
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:26,292
Please let me know.

1305
01:23:26,542 --> 01:23:30,625
Okay-okay. Okay-okay.

1306
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:41,875
What are you doing?

1307
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:43,583
Why are you cutting our fence?

1308
01:23:44,042 --> 01:23:45,208
Call your CO.

1309
01:23:45,917 --> 01:23:47,208
Alpha-to-Tiger!
Alpha-to-Tiger!

1310
01:23:47,292 --> 01:23:48,792
Tiger, this is Alpha. Over!

1311
01:23:48,875 --> 01:23:51,275
Sir, the Chinese have cut our fence.
Please come immediately.

1312
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,333
Commissar, what are you doing?

1313
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:03,167
As we said

1314
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:06,042
that we'll talk to our High Command.

1315
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,101
And he said that you're making
a big mistake by putting up this fence.

1316
01:24:09,125 --> 01:24:10,500
We've made no mistake.

1317
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:12,083
This fence is in our area.

1318
01:24:12,958 --> 01:24:17,042
According to the treaty signed
between us and the British in 1890...

1319
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:19,807
and the line of Sikkim was declared
as the international border.

1320
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,708
And you're breaking that law.

1321
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:23,583
You're toying with it.

1322
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:25,292
We are not toying with it.

1323
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:27,750
Commissar.

1324
01:24:28,167 --> 01:24:29,708
Sikkim is a protectorate.

1325
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:35,917
And the king of Sikkim willingly gave
the task of its protection to India.

1326
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:37,917
We're simply doing our duty.

1327
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:39,583
So please get out of here.

1328
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,792
We have ordered that
you will take this fence down.

1329
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:44,625
- Otherwise...
- Otherwise what?

1330
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:45,726
- Otherwise, we will take it down.
- We won't take it down.

1331
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:46,950
We won't take this fence down.

1332
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,184
- Take the fence down.
- We won't take this fence down.

1333
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:50,833
You cannot take this fence down.

1334
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,042
Hey...

1335
01:24:52,292 --> 01:24:53,042
Sir.

1336
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:54,375
Are you okay, sir?

1337
01:24:54,958 --> 01:24:55,958
Are you okay?

1338
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:56,667
I'm okay.

1339
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:58,625
- Ever
- Powerful...

1340
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:04,042
Rascals!

1341
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,833
Don't let them go.

1342
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:13,958
Hit them.

1343
01:25:15,417 --> 01:25:17,458
Let's show them.

1344
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:20,542
Hit them.

1345
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:25,708
Move back, rascal.

1346
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:27,542
Rascals!

1347
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:29,750
Rascals!

1348
01:25:37,292 --> 01:25:38,458
Stop fighting!

1349
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:39,958
Stop.

1350
01:25:43,667 --> 01:25:45,250
Stop.

1351
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:03,500
Look what your soldiers did?

1352
01:26:04,042 --> 01:26:07,417
They beat up my soldiers.

1353
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:09,958
And what did you do with our CO sir?

1354
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:16,292
Before this leads to anymore
bloodshed, better leave.

1355
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:18,917
We will talk to our High Command.

1356
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,875
India-China Brothers.

1357
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,500
Let's go.

1358
01:26:33,792 --> 01:26:34,792
Fall back!

1359
01:26:40,292 --> 01:26:42,542
India wants to capture Sikkim.

1360
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:44,667
We will not let them capture.

1361
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:46,833
They have built a fence.

1362
01:26:47,417 --> 01:26:50,708
We will give them a proper reply.

1363
01:26:50,958 --> 01:26:51,958
Okay.

1364
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:54,125
How do you feel, Colonel?

1365
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:56,875
I am okay, sir. It's just a scratch.

1366
01:26:57,292 --> 01:26:58,750
But these Chinese

1367
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:01,531
- they have crossed all limits.
- Yeah, I can see that.

1368
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:05,083
Sir, my opinion is that
we should put up cat wires.

1369
01:27:05,542 --> 01:27:06,542
Definitely.

1370
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,792
I am going on leave for a few days.

1371
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:11,417
And, I want this job
to be done before I go.

1372
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,500
It will be done, sir.

1373
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:14,625
- Good.
- But there's one thing, sir.

1374
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:17,583
Putting up cat wires
now can prove to be dangerous.

1375
01:27:18,292 --> 01:27:19,333
All hell will break loose.

1376
01:27:19,417 --> 01:27:21,917
As you rightly said, sir.
Nothing is impossible.

1377
01:27:22,083 --> 01:27:23,792
That's the spirit, Tiger.
That's the way.

1378
01:27:24,042 --> 01:27:24,958
Let's show them.

1379
01:27:25,042 --> 01:27:27,833
I'll brief you all,
how to prepare for the task.

1380
01:27:27,917 --> 01:27:29,208
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1381
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,250
The time has come...

1382
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:34,625
to stop the games that
the Chinese have been playing with us.

1383
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:39,333
Let me brief you.

1384
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:47,792
The task of laying cat wire fencing...

1385
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:52,542
will be held on the 11th of September,
at 05:00 hours.

1386
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:55,708
The work will be divided
between two parties.

1387
01:27:56,167 --> 01:28:01,250
The South Shoulder will be protected by
Commando Platoon lead by Captain PS Daggar.

1388
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:02,333
Yes, sir.

1389
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:08,125
And the North Shoulder will be protected
by the 18 Rajputs, and the in-charge...

1390
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,750
- will be Major Harbhajan Singh.
- Yes, sir!

1391
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:21,833
And Second Lt. Attar Singh, you will look
after OP Post with the MMG Section.

1392
01:28:22,042 --> 01:28:23,042
Sir!

1393
01:28:23,292 --> 01:28:24,292
Good!

1394
01:28:24,792 --> 01:28:29,333
To organize and coordinate the work of both
the parties is given to Major Bishen Singh.

1395
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:30,667
Yes, sir.

1396
01:28:30,917 --> 01:28:34,458
Colonel Rai, you will stay in your bunker
and keep an eye on the entire process.

1397
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,333
- And do not expose yourself.
- Yes, sir.

1398
01:28:39,167 --> 01:28:41,125
- Have I made myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

1399
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:43,042
Good!

1400
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:48,708
Remember...
heroes do not choose their destiny.

1401
01:28:49,542 --> 01:28:51,208
Destiny chooses them.

1402
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:55,875
Maybe the time has come
for all of you to become heroes.

1403
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:56,958
Yes, sir!

1404
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:04,500
The families,
friends, and patriots we lost...

1405
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:10,958
in the war of 1947...
'62 and '65...

1406
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:15,042
will continue to live
in the depths of our hearts.

1407
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:19,542
Those warriors, who never expected
anything from his country...

1408
01:29:20,042 --> 01:29:26,542
but lay down their life instead,
can never be forgotten.

1409
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:30,792
Our enemies motives
were never to annihilate us.

1410
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:37,417
They wanted to disrupt our traditions,
beliefs, and life.

1411
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:45,500
They didn't succeed, but they definitely
gave us a lesson, an opportunity.

1412
01:29:47,042 --> 01:29:50,958
An opportunity to be born again
for our country, our people.

1413
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:55,792
We've been burnt,
but not reduced to ashes.

1414
01:29:56,417 --> 01:29:59,208
We've been broken, but not shattered.

1415
01:29:59,625 --> 01:30:01,542
We shall rise again, together.

1416
01:30:02,167 --> 01:30:04,125
Because the future belongs to us.

1417
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:07,292
We will become what we were.

1418
01:30:08,042 --> 01:30:09,042
Superior.

1419
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:10,208
Empowered.

1420
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:11,583
Universal Leader.

1421
01:30:12,042 --> 01:30:13,042
Remember.

1422
01:30:13,542 --> 01:30:17,542
With the ashes of our ancestors
and cries from our temples...

1423
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:21,708
we'll shape our country
into what we were.

1424
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,625
Boys, remember.

1425
01:30:25,042 --> 01:30:28,042
We'll turn those blood soaked
pages of History again...

1426
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:36,500
and salute our brave martyrs
for their sacrifice, bravery and valor.

1427
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:43,375
We must create History
for our future generations...

1428
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:47,833
which will contain legends of
our victory, sacrifice and bravery.

1429
01:30:48,667 --> 01:30:52,125
And the inspiration to lay down
their life for their country.

1430
01:30:53,167 --> 01:30:54,500
God bless you, my men.

1431
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:57,333
- Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.

1432
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:59,167
- Long live...
- Mother India!

1433
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,458
- Long live...
- Mother India!

1434
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:05,000
- Hello, Gupta.
- Hello, sir.

1435
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:07,792
You must have heard CO sir's briefing.

1436
01:31:07,875 --> 01:31:08,875
Yes, sir.

1437
01:31:09,625 --> 01:31:10,851
We'll be putting up cat wire tomorrow.

1438
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:11,417
Yes.

1439
01:31:11,792 --> 01:31:12,976
And you are pretty wise yourself.

1440
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,625
Yes, sir.

1441
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:15,250
So make a call to my home.

1442
01:31:15,542 --> 01:31:16,958
What to do, Harbhajan sir?

1443
01:31:17,167 --> 01:31:20,708
If the headquarters find out,
I might lose my job.

1444
01:31:21,458 --> 01:31:22,167
That won't happen.

1445
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:23,458
Fine, I'll make the call.

1446
01:31:23,542 --> 01:31:25,792
That's the least I can do for you,
Harbhajan sir.

1447
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:30,583
Here.

1448
01:31:32,917 --> 01:31:35,333
Hello, father. Harbhajan, speaking.

1449
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:36,870
Harbhajan. How are you, son?

1450
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,458
You called so suddenly.
Are you alright?

1451
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:42,333
So fine, father,
that we're breaking stones out here.

1452
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:43,583
Stones?

1453
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:45,833
Why son? Why are you breaking stones?

1454
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:47,333
Only inmates break stones.

1455
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:51,000
No, no, father, just to build bunkers.

1456
01:31:51,667 --> 01:31:53,875
While working I was
really missing our fields.

1457
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:57,250
I will come back soon
and help you in the fields.

1458
01:31:57,667 --> 01:32:00,208
Son, you always worry about me.

1459
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:02,042
Worry about yourself.

1460
01:32:02,542 --> 01:32:04,542
I am absolutely fit, father.

1461
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:06,792
I'm always worried about the family.

1462
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:09,208
Especially my younger brother Arvail.

1463
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,250
He keeps staring at
my scooter all the time.

1464
01:32:12,875 --> 01:32:14,875
I've hidden the scooter keys.

1465
01:32:15,417 --> 01:32:16,667
He keeps looking for them.

1466
01:32:17,292 --> 01:32:21,167
Father, tell him to stop searching.

1467
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,958
The scooter is now his.

1468
01:32:24,792 --> 01:32:27,875
I've hidden the scooter keys
behind the Lord's picture.

1469
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:30,290
He can take it from there.

1470
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:31,958
And yes, father.

1471
01:32:33,167 --> 01:32:37,750
Also tell him that whenever he rides
the scooter, don't think he's alone.

1472
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:39,667
I am sitting behind him.

1473
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:41,083
Son, I know.

1474
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:42,792
You have a big heart.

1475
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:44,875
I am proud of you.

1476
01:32:44,958 --> 01:32:47,042
May God bless you with a long life.

1477
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:49,125
I don't know about long life, father.

1478
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:54,875
But pray that I can be of service
to my country and my motherland.

1479
01:32:57,083 --> 01:32:59,000
Okay, father. I am hanging up now.

1480
01:32:59,875 --> 01:33:02,333
Other guys are standing
in line to call home.

1481
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,417
Okay.

1482
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:04,500
Goodbye, father.

1483
01:33:04,542 --> 01:33:05,792
Bless you, son.

1484
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:10,208
Thank you.

1485
01:33:10,292 --> 01:33:11,625
Welcome, sir.

1486
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,268
Daggar sir,
the line's connected to your home.

1487
01:33:14,292 --> 01:33:16,125
Thank you very much, Gupta.

1488
01:33:16,708 --> 01:33:17,792
Hello, brother.

1489
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,042
Prithvi, are you in Delhi?

1490
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,042
No, I am not in Delhi, brother.
I am still in Nathu La.

1491
01:33:23,208 --> 01:33:24,708
Is everything alright?

1492
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:27,500
Yes, brother.

1493
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,125
Everything is fine.

1494
01:33:30,458 --> 01:33:32,458
I was missing all of you.

1495
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:35,226
And I thought I must speak
to all of you one last time.

1496
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:36,542
Last time?

1497
01:33:37,417 --> 01:33:39,958
No-no, it was just a slip of tongue.

1498
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:41,833
Are you all right?

1499
01:33:42,208 --> 01:33:43,083
And what about sister-in-law?

1500
01:33:43,167 --> 01:33:44,542
Everyone is alright.

1501
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:47,208
Your sister-in-law
has fixed your wedding date.

1502
01:33:47,292 --> 01:33:49,920
And she's preparing
for your wedding.

1503
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,458
What to give your bride.

1504
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:52,750
Your dress.

1505
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:54,792
Everyone is very happy.

1506
01:33:54,875 --> 01:33:56,500
Just come home soon.

1507
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:59,167
Tell sister-in-law that
I am happy being a bachelor.

1508
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,458
She is in a hurry to see
her brother-in-law married.

1509
01:34:02,542 --> 01:34:05,292
Because I trouble her and tease her.

1510
01:34:05,542 --> 01:34:06,542
Fine.

1511
01:34:07,458 --> 01:34:11,458
This time when I return home,
I won't trouble or tease her.

1512
01:34:11,667 --> 01:34:17,625
And then she will ask herself
what happened to my brother-in-law?

1513
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:20,583
But she will never find him.

1514
01:34:20,667 --> 01:34:23,667
I will give your message
to your sister-in-law.

1515
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,125
But do you have a message for her?

1516
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:27,958
Whom are you talking about?

1517
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:30,708
You know whom I am talking about.

1518
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:36,083
I promised her we'll go
see a movie together.

1519
01:34:38,292 --> 01:34:39,833
But I couldn't keep my promise.

1520
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:42,375
She must be waiting for me.

1521
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:46,667
Tell her that I will fulfill my promise
when I come back.

1522
01:34:48,542 --> 01:34:49,917
Okay, brother. I'm hanging up now.

1523
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:51,458
Give my love to everyone.

1524
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:52,958
Goodbye.

1525
01:34:53,042 --> 01:34:55,292
And Laxmichand wants to talk to you.

1526
01:34:56,167 --> 01:34:57,375
Come, Laxmichand.

1527
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:58,792
Hello.

1528
01:34:58,875 --> 01:34:59,875
Greetings, brother.

1529
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:01,667
Greetings. How are you?

1530
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:03,833
I am great, brother.
How is everyone else?

1531
01:35:03,917 --> 01:35:05,458
Everyone is fine.

1532
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:07,333
And everyone's fine in your home too.

1533
01:35:07,417 --> 01:35:09,542
You're the pride of our area.

1534
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:12,542
You've won so many boxing
competitions for us.

1535
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:16,833
Brother, we have a big boxing
competition tomorrow.

1536
01:35:17,042 --> 01:35:19,917
We need your blessings so that we win.

1537
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:20,500
Of course.

1538
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:23,250
Brother, tell my family
that I am absolutely fine.

1539
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:23,792
Okay.

1540
01:35:23,875 --> 01:35:24,708
Goodbye, brother.

1541
01:35:24,792 --> 01:35:25,875
I'm hanging up now.

1542
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,458
Do something, Physician.

1543
01:35:32,542 --> 01:35:34,208
- Attar... Attar.
- Attar my son.

1544
01:35:34,292 --> 01:35:35,667
Wake up, son.

1545
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:37,667
Doctor... my son...

1546
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:38,750
Attar, my son.

1547
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:39,976
- Doctor.
- What is wrong with him?

1548
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,640
- This is not possible, Doctor.
- Oh, God.

1549
01:35:41,708 --> 01:35:42,792
Attar.

1550
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:45,417
No, my son...

1551
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,333
- Open your eyes, son.
- Attar..Attar.

1552
01:35:47,417 --> 01:35:50,833
- Get up, son. Get up.
- Attar my son, open your eyes.

1553
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:53,250
Attar... Attar.

1554
01:35:53,792 --> 01:35:55,792
Look at him.
What's wrong with him?

1555
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:58,375
- Someone stop them.
- Attar.

1556
01:35:59,292 --> 01:36:02,333
Attar. Attar, my son.

1557
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,920
Mother!
Mother, I am alive.

1558
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,458
Mother!

1559
01:36:07,417 --> 01:36:08,833
Mother, I am alive.

1560
01:36:09,833 --> 01:36:12,958
Attar Singh, are you all right?

1561
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,893
And why are you missing your mother?

1562
01:36:14,917 --> 01:36:17,375
- Did you see a nightmare?
- What's wrong, Attar Singh?

1563
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:26,042
Sir, years ago I met
with a terrible incident.

1564
01:36:27,792 --> 01:36:29,958
And it keeps haunting me
in my dreams as well.

1565
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:32,542
What incident, Attar Singh? Tell us.

1566
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,375
Sir, one day I came down
with high fever.

1567
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:41,500
The physician arrived
and declared me dead.

1568
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:46,375
My family took me off the bed
and laid me on the ground.

1569
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,167
And started preparing
for my final rites.

1570
01:36:52,417 --> 01:36:56,208
With God's grace,
I suddenly woke up...

1571
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,583
and my mother screamed,
"My son is alive".

1572
01:37:02,417 --> 01:37:06,292
Call it a miracle or God's grace,
whatever.

1573
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:08,000
This means you've got God's blessings.

1574
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:09,583
- Isn't that right, Harbhajan?
- Yes.

1575
01:37:09,667 --> 01:37:12,667
Attar Singh, we're going
to put up fencing tomorrow.

1576
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,542
And if we went to war with the Chinese,
then you will survive.

1577
01:37:17,167 --> 01:37:18,167
Yes.

1578
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:20,458
But maybe we won't.

1579
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:25,625
Attar Singh,
there's a saying in the army that...

1580
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:29,625
if one soldier dies,
then the other soldier takes him home.

1581
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:31,583
Attar Singh...

1582
01:37:32,792 --> 01:37:35,750
tomorrow if anything happens
while putting up the fencing...

1583
01:37:36,667 --> 01:37:39,542
then I swear I don't know
what I will do.

1584
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:43,000
So my...

1585
01:37:43,792 --> 01:37:47,417
What is that word in English, Daggar?

1586
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,083
- Chance.
- Chances.

1587
01:37:49,875 --> 01:37:52,333
So I have more chances
of attaining martyrdom.

1588
01:37:53,042 --> 01:37:54,042
Understand.

1589
01:37:54,125 --> 01:37:57,208
And if that happens,
will you do something for me?

1590
01:37:57,292 --> 01:37:58,500
Yes, sir.

1591
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:06,125
You will go to my village,
meet my father and tell him.

1592
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:10,000
That he must scatter
my ashes in our field.

1593
01:38:13,542 --> 01:38:16,833
Sir, you two are my seniors.

1594
01:38:17,667 --> 01:38:21,042
I apologize and say that you two
should stop talking this nonsense.

1595
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,833
- Nonsense.
- We will all be safe.

1596
01:38:25,125 --> 01:38:26,750
And we'll stay together
for a long time.

1597
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:27,833
Of course.

1598
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:29,667
Sir, there's a saying in the platoon.

1599
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,417
Brother to my left, brother to my right.

1600
01:38:33,792 --> 01:38:36,167
Together we stand, together we fight.

1601
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:37,333
Nice saying, Attar Singh.

1602
01:38:37,417 --> 01:38:39,625
But why is it in English,
and not in Hindi.

1603
01:38:39,708 --> 01:38:41,500
He's a wise man after all...

1604
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:42,625
- Smile.
- Sir.

1605
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:43,920
- Smile.
- Sir.

1606
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,268
Bragging your English
in the middle of the night.

1607
01:38:45,292 --> 01:38:46,458
Missing your mother.

1608
01:38:49,208 --> 01:38:51,042
- Lt. Col. Alexander.
- Sir.

1609
01:38:51,417 --> 01:38:54,292
The fencing work
begins tomorrow at 5 am.

1610
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:58,083
We might need artillery support
to counter the Chinese Army.

1611
01:38:58,333 --> 01:38:59,917
Be prepared for any eventuality.

1612
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:01,083
Okay, sir.

1613
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:07,208
Brothers, the intelligence
reports that the Chinese...

1614
01:39:07,417 --> 01:39:10,667
can get violent
while we lay the fencing.

1615
01:39:11,167 --> 01:39:12,792
And a war might break out as well.

1616
01:39:13,208 --> 01:39:16,083
So we must take care of each other.

1617
01:39:16,167 --> 01:39:20,417
And even though we're not family,
but we're brothers.

1618
01:39:20,833 --> 01:39:22,417
Any doubt?

1619
01:39:26,042 --> 01:39:27,292
What are you doing?

1620
01:39:28,042 --> 01:39:29,250
Nothing.

1621
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:31,750
Just take a look
at my family's picture.

1622
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:52,833
What are you doing?

1623
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:57,958
They are tense about tomorrow morning
and seeing the pictures of their families.

1624
01:40:07,125 --> 01:40:09,226
Then let's all watch the pictures
of our families as well.

1625
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:10,750
Don't be shy, Harbhajan. Go on.

1626
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Yes, sir.

1627
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:26,958
"The night's telling us stories..."

1628
01:40:27,708 --> 01:40:35,292
"A stream of memories... running wild"

1629
01:40:53,667 --> 01:41:01,667
"The night's telling us stories..."

1630
01:41:02,292 --> 01:41:09,708
"A stream of memories... running wild"

1631
01:41:10,917 --> 01:41:13,708
"Those moments that passed away..."

1632
01:41:13,792 --> 01:41:16,542
"have come back to haunt us."

1633
01:41:16,625 --> 01:41:19,500
"So many familiar faces..."

1634
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:22,667
"flashing before my eyes
in this loneliness."

1635
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:28,125
"But there's no one here..."

1636
01:41:28,208 --> 01:41:33,792
"My memories have brought
everyone here."

1637
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,917
"The night's telling us stories..."

1638
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,833
Until then have these sweets...

1639
01:41:39,667 --> 01:41:41,000
and think of us.

1640
01:41:42,625 --> 01:41:50,417
"A stream of memories...
running wild"

1641
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:04,750
Look, don't forget me.

1642
01:42:06,625 --> 01:42:08,083
Keep writing to me.

1643
01:42:08,542 --> 01:42:10,375
And, don't try to be
a hero at the border.

1644
01:43:00,333 --> 01:43:05,792
"The bindi shimmering
on the face..."

1645
01:43:06,125 --> 01:43:11,167
"and the veil waiving in the air."

1646
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:17,542
"The beautiful decoration
on the threshold of my home."

1647
01:43:17,625 --> 01:43:23,000
"Some festival is coming again."

1648
01:43:23,708 --> 01:43:29,458
"Someone walking on his lil' feet."

1649
01:43:29,542 --> 01:43:34,917
"And someone praying with the beads."

1650
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:41,000
"A platter, a wrist,
and a rakhi."

1651
01:43:41,083 --> 01:43:46,333
"A temple, a lamp,
and the light."

1652
01:43:46,417 --> 01:43:54,042
"The night's telling us stories..."

1653
01:43:55,083 --> 01:44:03,000
"A stream of memories...
running wild"

1654
01:44:08,792 --> 01:44:12,333
Platoon, Attention!

1655
01:44:13,083 --> 01:44:14,333
Don't move!

1656
01:44:18,875 --> 01:44:20,083
Jai Hind, sir.

1657
01:44:20,292 --> 01:44:23,667
- Jai Hind.
- 25 JCOs, 275 other ranks are present.

1658
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Jai Hind, sir.

1659
01:44:27,458 --> 01:44:28,458
Jai Hind.

1660
01:44:35,542 --> 01:44:37,792
Platoon, don't move!

1661
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:47,292
Sir, 25 JCOs and 275
other ranks are present.

1662
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,042
Bravo.

1663
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,260
Lt. Attar,
tell the platoon to march forward.

1664
01:44:55,833 --> 01:44:58,708
Platoon, forward march.

1665
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:34,208
Boys, speed up.

1666
01:46:37,708 --> 01:46:39,875
Sir, our boys are working pretty fast.

1667
01:46:43,333 --> 01:46:44,333
Don't stop.

1668
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:46,135
- Good job Major Chima, keep it going.
- Sir.

1669
01:46:48,792 --> 01:46:49,875
Sir.

1670
01:46:50,125 --> 01:46:51,417
Look at the Chinese.

1671
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
The Chinese have built
new bunkers, sir.

1672
01:46:57,708 --> 01:46:58,708
It's okay, Tiger.

1673
01:46:59,833 --> 01:47:03,000
Let them do what they want
on their territory, Tiger.

1674
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:05,500
We'll strengthen our post.

1675
01:47:05,583 --> 01:47:06,583
Yes, sir.

1676
01:47:32,958 --> 01:47:36,542
By putting up cat wires,
you're making this fencing permanent.

1677
01:47:37,708 --> 01:47:39,667
You think we're stupid?

1678
01:47:40,917 --> 01:47:42,750
Are we idiots?

1679
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:44,708
Stop it.

1680
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:45,962
We won't stop.

1681
01:47:46,042 --> 01:47:47,802
Or else you'll have to face
the consequences.

1682
01:47:47,875 --> 01:47:48,875
We won't stop.

1683
01:47:48,917 --> 01:47:50,417
We're ready to face any consequences.

1684
01:47:55,083 --> 01:47:57,500
- Stop them.
- No one will stop working.

1685
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,962
Stay back... Captain Daggar.

1686
01:48:01,042 --> 01:48:02,393
What the hell are you doing,
Captain Daggar?

1687
01:48:02,417 --> 01:48:05,250
- Captain Daggar, why did you hit the Commissar?
- Sir, are you okay?

1688
01:48:06,042 --> 01:48:08,375
Sir, you can punish me
in any way you like.

1689
01:48:08,458 --> 01:48:10,042
But I've taken revenge for you.

1690
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:11,917
Even they did the same thing to you.

1691
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,667
Commissar,
I apologize for my soldier's actions.

1692
01:48:14,875 --> 01:48:16,792
India-China Brothers.

1693
01:48:17,292 --> 01:48:19,042
India-China Brothers.

1694
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:21,417
India-China Brothers.

1695
01:48:21,667 --> 01:48:23,667
Come on. Let's go back.

1696
01:48:34,625 --> 01:48:36,667
Great. Buddy...

1697
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:23,750
This silence,
and the Chinese leaving so quietly.

1698
01:49:24,625 --> 01:49:26,417
Something doesn't fit.

1699
01:49:28,333 --> 01:49:29,333
Fire.

1700
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:32,625
Fire everything we have. Fire!

1701
01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:36,458
Our platoon's out there too.

1702
01:49:36,708 --> 01:49:37,750
I don't care.

1703
01:49:38,292 --> 01:49:39,083
Just fire.

1704
01:49:39,292 --> 01:49:40,292
You go.

1705
01:49:41,375 --> 01:49:42,375
Fire.

1706
01:50:07,667 --> 01:50:10,292
Once we finish putting up these wires,
we can sleep peacefully.

1707
01:50:19,625 --> 01:50:22,792
My sister is so stubborn.
Do you know what she says?

1708
01:50:22,875 --> 01:50:23,458
What?

1709
01:50:23,542 --> 01:50:27,917
If I don't attend her wedding,
she won't get married.

1710
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,542
Sharma! Sharma!

1711
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:32,000
Fire!

1712
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,625
Fire. Fire.

1713
01:50:40,708 --> 01:50:42,708
Hurry.

1714
01:50:43,792 --> 01:50:45,042
Hurry.

1715
01:51:34,333 --> 01:51:35,625
Attack!

1716
01:51:44,083 --> 01:51:46,042
Come fast. Come fast.

1717
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,292
Get me the wireless.

1718
01:52:04,667 --> 01:52:06,125
Tiger to Mike. Tiger to Mike.

1719
01:52:06,208 --> 01:52:08,500
Yeah, this is Mike.
Tell me, Tiger.

1720
01:52:08,917 --> 01:52:10,833
Mike, open fire. Over and out!

1721
01:52:11,333 --> 01:52:13,208
Bring the RL.

1722
01:52:21,708 --> 01:52:23,042
Fire.

1723
01:52:40,542 --> 01:52:42,542
Brother, I will handle this post.

1724
01:52:51,708 --> 01:52:53,833
Come on, you bloody...

1725
01:53:15,208 --> 01:53:18,042
Sir, the Chinese
have started arti-fire.

1726
01:53:18,917 --> 01:53:20,792
But they are off target.

1727
01:53:20,875 --> 01:53:23,167
Their shells are falling
on the mountain behind us.

1728
01:53:23,417 --> 01:53:26,417
Sir, I request arti-fire.
We can finish them, sir.

1729
01:53:26,792 --> 01:53:28,417
Hold your position, Col.

1730
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:31,833
I will speak to the high command
and get back to you.

1731
01:53:32,208 --> 01:53:33,333
Over and out!

1732
01:53:39,250 --> 01:53:42,083
Sir, the Chinese have opened
Arti-fire and mortar.

1733
01:53:42,917 --> 01:53:45,003
We need Arti support immediately, sir.

1734
01:53:45,083 --> 01:53:47,458
Let me talk to high command
and get back to you.

1735
01:53:50,083 --> 01:53:53,292
Sir, we lose time, we lose men.
I hope you understand.

1736
01:53:53,708 --> 01:53:55,417
Sagat, give me some time.

1737
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:56,875
Waiting for your call, sir.

1738
01:53:56,958 --> 01:53:57,958
Over and out.

1739
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Over and out!

1740
01:54:04,542 --> 01:54:05,792
Forward!

1741
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,083
Fire!

1742
01:54:32,125 --> 01:54:34,000
Mortar Fire.

1743
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,458
Bas♪♪♪

1744
01:55:03,625 --> 01:55:05,750
You bloody..

1745
01:55:24,958 --> 01:55:26,003
Laxmichand.

1746
01:55:26,083 --> 01:55:27,583
- Are you okay, Laxmichand?
- Sir.

1747
01:55:27,833 --> 01:55:30,958
- Don't let those bas♪♪♪ get away.
- Get up.

1748
01:56:27,083 --> 01:56:28,583
They just keep coming.

1749
01:56:29,583 --> 01:56:31,003
Now we must charge ahead.

1750
01:56:31,083 --> 01:56:34,962
- March forward.
- Boys, get in.

1751
01:56:35,042 --> 01:56:37,167
- Ever
- Powerful...

1752
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:39,167
Daggar, move ahead.

1753
01:57:43,333 --> 01:57:45,792
We need the bloody artillery!

1754
01:57:47,333 --> 01:57:48,333
Come on!

1755
01:58:08,167 --> 01:58:10,583
Hurry.

1756
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:11,958
Hurry.

1757
01:58:18,833 --> 01:58:19,917
Forward.

1758
01:58:21,208 --> 01:58:25,500
Brother,
the Chinese have built a tunnel.

1759
01:58:25,583 --> 01:58:27,625
These bas♪♪♪ are coming from there.

1760
01:58:27,708 --> 01:58:28,708
I am going ahead.

1761
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:32,000
Daggar, not you.

1762
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:35,708
Listen to your brother, Daggar.
Stop.

1763
01:58:42,292 --> 01:58:44,625
Fire. Fire.

1764
01:58:49,793 --> 01:58:55,208
Faster. Faster.

1765
01:59:10,958 --> 01:59:13,250
No. Stop, Daggar.

1766
01:59:13,333 --> 01:59:17,667
- Fire. He's coming.
- Stop.

1767
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:20,208
- Fire.
- Stop.

1768
01:59:29,333 --> 01:59:31,083
Stop, please.

1769
02:00:01,125 --> 02:00:03,042
Stop, please.

1770
02:00:05,208 --> 02:00:06,750
Always...

1771
02:00:23,375 --> 02:00:26,250
- Sir. Sir.
- Sir. Wake up, sir.

1772
02:00:26,458 --> 02:00:27,042
Sir.

1773
02:00:27,125 --> 02:00:30,167
Khalsa belongs to God.
Victory belongs to God!

1774
02:00:30,667 --> 02:00:31,333
Sir.

1775
02:00:31,417 --> 02:00:35,000
Khalsa belongs to God.
Victory belongs to God!

1776
02:00:35,250 --> 02:00:38,583
Khalsa belongs to God.
Victory belongs to God!

1777
02:00:38,875 --> 02:00:42,500
Khalsa belongs to God.
Victory belongs to God!

1778
02:00:42,667 --> 02:00:45,000
You bloody...

1779
02:00:45,208 --> 02:00:46,375
Wait.

1780
02:00:50,583 --> 02:00:52,792
Wait, you bas♪♪♪♪

1781
02:01:33,875 --> 02:01:36,417
Gurcharan, give me grenades.

1782
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:40,167
Hurry up.

1783
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:44,000
Quickly. Quickly.

1784
02:01:44,250 --> 02:01:47,000
I am going ahead,
give me cover fire. Okay.

1785
02:01:47,083 --> 02:01:48,083
Yes, sir.

1786
02:01:51,083 --> 02:01:52,208
Tiger.

1787
02:01:52,417 --> 02:01:54,375
- Wait, sir. Don't go ahead.
- Cover me.

1788
02:01:54,458 --> 02:01:55,625
Okay, sir.

1789
02:02:11,625 --> 02:02:12,962
- Attar Singh.
- Sir.

1790
02:02:13,042 --> 02:02:15,208
I must go ahead in order
to encourage the platoon.

1791
02:02:15,708 --> 02:02:16,458
Give me cover fire.

1792
02:02:16,542 --> 02:02:17,750
Be careful, sir.

1793
02:02:20,167 --> 02:02:24,875
Troops, charge!

1794
02:02:52,708 --> 02:02:54,000
Bishen, are you all right?

1795
02:02:54,083 --> 02:02:55,792
CO sir, you shouldn't have
come up here.

1796
02:02:55,875 --> 02:02:57,375
Please go back.

1797
02:03:00,583 --> 02:03:01,792
Grenades!

1798
02:03:08,083 --> 02:03:10,292
Sir. Sir.

1799
02:04:10,625 --> 02:04:12,875
You killed my Rajput brothers,
didn't you?

1800
02:04:13,042 --> 02:04:16,208
Take that... and that... and that...

1801
02:04:20,792 --> 02:04:22,125
Why are you not firing?

1802
02:04:32,917 --> 02:04:34,277
They were all killed with a knife.

1803
02:04:34,458 --> 02:04:36,000
There is someone here.

1804
02:04:36,208 --> 02:04:37,750
They were all killed using a knife.

1805
02:04:44,583 --> 02:04:45,792
There is someone here.

1806
02:04:45,875 --> 02:04:46,708
Go and search for him.

1807
02:04:46,792 --> 02:04:47,917
Everyone go.

1808
02:05:52,167 --> 02:05:56,958
Khalsa belongs God.
Victory belongs to God!

1809
02:05:57,583 --> 02:06:02,083
Khalsa belongs God.
Victory belongs to God!

1810
02:06:02,667 --> 02:06:06,542
India-China brothers!

1811
02:06:10,542 --> 02:06:12,833
Sir, we've ordered for arti-firing.

1812
02:06:12,917 --> 02:06:14,750
We must call our platoon back.

1813
02:06:14,833 --> 02:06:17,333
Otherwise,
our men will die from the shelling.

1814
02:06:17,417 --> 02:06:20,097
CO sir, Daggar sir, and Tiger
Nathu La are on the Chinese territory.

1815
02:06:20,125 --> 02:06:22,292
- I will go and inform him.
- Okay, sir.

1816
02:06:22,375 --> 02:06:23,375
Come on.

1817
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,417
Sir. Sir, are you okay?

1818
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:33,042
We're good.

1819
02:06:33,125 --> 02:06:35,542
Sir, we've orders for arti-firing.

1820
02:06:35,625 --> 02:06:36,708
We have to go back.

1821
02:06:36,792 --> 02:06:38,667
That's good.
Tell the men to fall back.

1822
02:06:38,750 --> 02:06:42,083
- Ask them to fall back.
- Platoon, go back to our territory.

1823
02:06:42,167 --> 02:06:43,583
There's going to be arti-firing.

1824
02:06:43,708 --> 02:06:44,375
Come on, Bishen.

1825
02:06:44,458 --> 02:06:47,292
- Fall back!
- Help CO sir.

1826
02:06:47,833 --> 02:06:49,625
Lt. Col. Alexander.

1827
02:06:49,958 --> 02:06:51,500
Give them all hell!

1828
02:06:51,708 --> 02:06:52,750
Over and out!

1829
02:06:57,458 --> 02:06:59,667
Come back, guys. Come back quickly.

1830
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,667
And here's our arti-shells.

1831
02:07:17,542 --> 02:07:21,458
We won't miss these fireworks, sir.

1832
02:07:45,125 --> 02:07:47,917
What about Constable Laxmichand?

1833
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,583
Laxmichand is no more, sir.

1834
02:07:50,208 --> 02:07:51,792
Along with Raghavchand Pandey as well.

1835
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,458
What about Sepoy Ramchandra
and Hariharan? And Nagendra?

1836
02:07:58,958 --> 02:08:00,708
They all attained martyrdom, sir.

1837
02:08:01,125 --> 02:08:05,833
And the most number of casualties
were our engineers, sir.

1838
02:08:22,583 --> 02:08:23,083
Sir.

1839
02:08:23,167 --> 02:08:25,750
Major General Sagat,
China wants ceasefire.

1840
02:08:25,833 --> 02:08:26,750
We've agreed.

1841
02:08:26,833 --> 02:08:27,920
Tell troops to ceasefire.

1842
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,667
And pass this message to the platoon.

1843
02:08:29,750 --> 02:08:30,500
Over and out.

1844
02:08:30,583 --> 02:08:31,583
Sir.

1845
02:08:45,708 --> 02:08:46,875
- Parashar.
- Yes, sir.

1846
02:08:46,958 --> 02:08:48,292
They are surrendering.

1847
02:08:49,958 --> 02:08:52,417
- Always...
- Strong!

1848
02:08:53,083 --> 02:08:54,542
We must inform CO sir.

1849
02:08:54,625 --> 02:08:55,667
Sir!

1850
02:09:02,875 --> 02:09:04,542
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

1851
02:09:04,625 --> 02:09:06,208
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

1852
02:09:06,833 --> 02:09:09,250
Chinese are waving the white flag.

1853
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,375
They want to surrender.

1854
02:09:14,792 --> 02:09:17,667
Sir, with your permission.
I will take their surrender.

1855
02:09:18,542 --> 02:09:20,458
We'll both take the surrender, Tiger.

1856
02:09:21,083 --> 02:09:22,375
Are you sure, sir?

1857
02:09:22,583 --> 02:09:23,863
You've lost a lot of blood, sir.

1858
02:09:25,167 --> 02:09:27,958
I am not going to miss
this Historic moment for anything, Tiger.

1859
02:09:29,292 --> 02:09:30,292
Come, sir.

1860
02:09:40,833 --> 02:09:41,833
Let's go.

1861
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:53,000
- Parashar.
- Sir.

1862
02:09:54,583 --> 02:09:56,833
Tell them that we're ready
for a cease-fire.

1863
02:09:57,750 --> 02:10:00,958
But this fence will remain
here permanently.

1864
02:10:02,208 --> 02:10:03,417
Yes, sir.

1865
02:10:04,125 --> 02:10:06,125
We are also ready for a cease-fire.

1866
02:10:06,292 --> 02:10:08,542
But the fencing will remain
here permanently.

1867
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:09,750
Okay.

1868
02:10:10,250 --> 02:10:11,833
But we want the bodies
of our soldiers.

1869
02:10:12,958 --> 02:10:14,208
Sir, they are agreeing.

1870
02:10:14,292 --> 02:10:17,000
But he's saying that he first wants
the bodies of their soldiers.

1871
02:10:20,667 --> 02:10:21,667
Okay.

1872
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,167
Tell them that they can collect
the bodies of their soldiers.

1873
02:10:25,375 --> 02:10:28,167
Then we'll take the bodies of our soldiers.

1874
02:10:29,042 --> 02:10:30,042
Yes, sir.

1875
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:32,309
First, you take the
bodies of your soldiers...

1876
02:10:32,333 --> 02:10:34,213
then, we'll take the
bodies of our soldiers.

1877
02:10:34,417 --> 02:10:35,417
Okay.

1878
02:11:00,083 --> 02:11:01,843
You can take the bodies
of your soldiers now.

1879
02:11:02,458 --> 02:11:04,667
But, sign this letter for me first.

1880
02:11:06,458 --> 02:11:07,750
- Parashar.
- Sir.

1881
02:11:10,542 --> 02:11:12,958
Sir, this letter states
that we started the war.

1882
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:16,101
As a result, the bodies of our officers
and soldiers are in their territory.

1883
02:11:16,125 --> 02:11:19,125
And if we don't sign this letter,
then they won't give us the bodies.

1884
02:11:21,792 --> 02:11:23,792
How low can these people stoop?

1885
02:11:24,208 --> 02:11:27,042
We handed over the bodies
of their officers without any condition.

1886
02:11:28,708 --> 02:11:30,458
This is international politics.

1887
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:33,167
But I have my orders.

1888
02:11:33,792 --> 02:11:37,042
We must bring back the bodies
of our officers and soldiers at any cost.

1889
02:11:37,167 --> 02:11:38,167
Yes, sir.

1890
02:11:50,292 --> 02:11:52,500
Stretcher party, come forward.

1891
02:12:46,542 --> 02:12:50,625
"Friends..."

1892
02:12:50,833 --> 02:12:54,833
"My friends..."

1893
02:12:55,458 --> 02:13:03,458
"Hear me one last time..."

1894
02:13:05,708 --> 02:13:12,125
"Hear me..."

1895
02:13:41,292 --> 02:13:49,292
"I've written a message with
my blood on the cold surface of time."

1896
02:13:51,167 --> 02:13:55,583
"And the one this message is for..."

1897
02:13:55,875 --> 02:14:00,208
"And the one this message is for..."

1898
02:14:00,833 --> 02:14:02,101
And if that happens,
will you do something for me?

1899
02:14:02,125 --> 02:14:03,167
Yes, sir.

1900
02:14:03,333 --> 02:14:08,583
You will go to my village,
meet my father and tell him.

1901
02:14:10,042 --> 02:14:12,042
That he must scatter
my ashes in our field.

1902
02:14:12,958 --> 02:14:17,583
"you must deliver it to them."

1903
02:14:17,792 --> 02:14:25,792
"You must convey my feelings to them."

1904
02:14:27,333 --> 02:14:35,333
"I've written a message with
my blood on the cold surface of time."

1905
02:14:37,167 --> 02:14:41,500
"And the one this message is for..."

1906
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,708
"And the one this message is for..."

1907
02:15:25,208 --> 02:15:33,208
"I've written a message with
my blood on the cold surface of time."

1908
02:15:35,083 --> 02:15:39,292
"And the one this message is for..."

1909
02:15:39,833 --> 02:15:44,333
"And the one this message is for..."

1910
02:15:44,792 --> 02:15:49,458
"you must deliver it to them."

1911
02:15:49,667 --> 02:15:57,667
"You must convey my feelings to them."

1912
02:15:59,167 --> 02:16:07,167
"I've written a message with
my blood on the cold surface of time."

1913
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:13,292
"And the one this message is for..."

1914
02:16:13,833 --> 02:16:18,583
"And the one this message is for..."

1915
02:17:23,250 --> 02:17:24,250
Daggar sir.

1916
02:17:24,458 --> 02:17:25,208
Anyone at home?

1917
02:17:25,292 --> 02:17:27,125
Yes. Who is it?

1918
02:17:27,208 --> 02:17:29,417
We've brought Captain
Prithvi Singh Daggar.

1919
02:17:30,958 --> 02:17:32,708
Father, they have brought Prithvi.

1920
02:17:32,792 --> 02:17:34,042
My Prithvi.

1921
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:36,625
- What are you saying?
- My Prithvi.

1922
02:17:36,708 --> 02:17:38,833
My son.

1923
02:17:38,917 --> 02:17:41,167
My son. My Prithvi.

1924
02:17:41,375 --> 02:17:42,625
What has happened?

1925
02:17:43,417 --> 02:17:48,125
- My Prithvi.
- "Tell my mother..."

1926
02:17:48,208 --> 02:17:53,125
- "That she told me when I was young..."
- Prithvi. What has happened?

1927
02:17:53,208 --> 02:17:58,833
- "...that this land is also my mother."
- Oh, God!

1928
02:17:58,917 --> 02:18:02,375
Captain Prithvi Singh Daggar laid down his
life while fighting against the Chinese.

1929
02:18:03,042 --> 02:18:06,917
Uncle, your son fought bravely.

1930
02:18:07,667 --> 02:18:10,500
What have you done, God?

1931
02:18:10,708 --> 02:18:12,958
We are ruined.

1932
02:18:13,042 --> 02:18:20,708
- "I have protected the honor of my motherland."
- What has happened?

1933
02:18:20,792 --> 02:18:22,333
My Prithvi.

1934
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:27,167
My Prithvi.
"Don't cry O mother..."

1935
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:29,750
"Don't cry..."

1936
02:18:29,833 --> 02:18:32,208
"Don't cry..."

1937
02:18:35,083 --> 02:18:38,375
- My child, it'll be dark soon.
- Dear.

1938
02:18:40,042 --> 02:18:41,542
He won't come back.

1939
02:18:41,625 --> 02:18:43,833
You've been sitting
in the fields since morning.

1940
02:18:43,917 --> 02:18:45,083
- Let's go home.
- No.

1941
02:18:45,167 --> 02:18:47,042
- Let's go home.
- No.

1942
02:18:47,125 --> 02:18:48,500
Let's go, dear.

1943
02:18:48,583 --> 02:18:50,962
He is no more, dear.
He will never come back.

1944
02:18:51,042 --> 02:18:52,417
That's not true.

1945
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:54,667
I won't go anywhere.
He will come and meet me.

1946
02:18:56,875 --> 02:18:58,958
- Major Harbhajan Singh.
- Yes.

1947
02:18:59,042 --> 02:19:01,042
We've brought Major Harbhajan.

1948
02:19:01,125 --> 02:19:03,375
Father, brother Harbhajan is back.

1949
02:19:03,458 --> 02:19:06,458
Dear, Harbhajan is back home.

1950
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:25,292
"Tell my father..."

1951
02:19:25,375 --> 02:19:30,083
- "That he told me when I was young..."
- My son.

1952
02:19:30,167 --> 02:19:37,625
- "...don't do anything to embarrass me."
- My son. My son.

1953
02:19:38,333 --> 02:19:39,792
My son.

1954
02:19:39,875 --> 02:19:47,000
- "...don't do anything to embarrass me."
- What has happened?

1955
02:19:47,125 --> 02:19:54,042
- "...the brave continues to live even after he's dead."
- My son.

1956
02:19:54,250 --> 02:19:59,083
- "I believed what you said..."
- My son.

1957
02:19:59,167 --> 02:20:03,875
- "...I laid down my life for my nation."
- My son.

1958
02:20:04,042 --> 02:20:10,125
"Look, father, I am still alive
even after I am dead."

1959
02:20:10,208 --> 02:20:12,875
We are ruined.

1960
02:20:13,750 --> 02:20:21,750
"I am alive in a billion hearts."

1961
02:20:23,375 --> 02:20:31,375
"I am alive in the faith of my country."

1962
02:20:32,542 --> 02:20:34,500
My son.

1963
02:20:34,750 --> 02:20:39,917
"I dwell in these young faces."

1964
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,500
"I am guarding the borders."

1965
02:20:44,583 --> 02:20:49,250
"Don't be sad for me."

1966
02:20:49,333 --> 02:20:54,083
- "I dwell in these young faces."
- My son!

1967
02:20:54,167 --> 02:20:59,042
- "Feel proud of me."
- My son!

1968
02:20:59,125 --> 02:21:04,003
"Feel proud of me."

1969
02:21:04,083 --> 02:21:06,500
"I am alive..."

1970
02:21:06,667 --> 02:21:08,958
"I am alive..."

1971
02:21:09,042 --> 02:21:11,375
"I am alive..."

1972
02:21:11,458 --> 02:21:13,833
"I am alive..."

1973
02:21:13,917 --> 02:21:16,083
"I am alive..."

1974
02:21:16,167 --> 02:21:18,625
"I am alive..."

1975
02:21:18,708 --> 02:21:22,458
"I am alive..."
