1
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,311
About 2000 years ago,

2
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,475
well known as land of Dharma and Karma,

3
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,949
as holy land,

4
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,886
our country India was famous,

5
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,755
when it turned into a battlefield
of castes and religions,

6
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,523
when ignorance took over
the common sense,

7
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,260
when people killed people
without any sense or reason,

8
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:50,136
when the foundations
of theism is shaken,

9
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,810
when the places of holy
sacrifices are shut down,

10
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,775
in the state of Kerala,

11
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,743
in a village known as Kaladi,

12
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,112
Aadi Shankara was born,

13
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,986
he took to Sanyasa as little boy,

14
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,481
wrote hundreds of holy scripts,

15
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:11,921
he walked from Kanyakumari
to Kashmir 4 times,

16
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:17,159
he unified 72 religions into one
and become Jagadguru, a world teacher!

17
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,764
Aadi Shankara lived in this
world for just 32 years only.

18
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:29,876
Had he not born, who would've
shown direction to Hindu religion?

19
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,714
Would the Dharma of Ashram
survived in this world?

20
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,885
Would unity in diversity
be possible in India?

21
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,384
Many such doubts would rise
in our hearts.

22
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,617
Principles of Lord Shiva
is our principles,

23
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,318
that is humanity,

24
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,055
he preached this to the world,

25
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,463
he became a dot on forehead
of Hindu religion,

26
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,330
that messiah.

27
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,702
Arise, awake and stop not until
you reach the destination,

28
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,207
with this clarion call awakening
the conscience of Indian nation,

29
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,311
Swami Vivekananda, a guide to the youth,

30
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,415
was inspired by Aadi Shankara!

31
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,747
The path shown by Jagadguru
is for everyone.

32
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,412
Let's understand his teachings.

33
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,156
Let's follow it.

34
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,690
He's the first Guru of Hindi religion,

35
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,762
that's why he's Jagadguru!

36
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,667
Who am I?

37
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,874
Who you are?

38
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,240
Who is God?
Who is human?

39
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,550
Which Guru? Who is disciple?

40
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,247
Who is the giver?
Who is the bearer?

41
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:28,564
Who knows this?
Who gets us to know?

42
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,441
What is start? What is the oldest?

43
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:48,074
What is spirit? What is not?

44
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,589
What is knowledge? What is false?

45
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:57,194
What is illusion? What is mystery?

46
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,460
What is Dharma? What is the aim?

47
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,592
What is peace? What is happiness?

48
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:13,507
Why these sorrows?
Why this destruction?

49
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,545
When will this end?

50
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,089
What is birth? What is death?

51
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,963
What is good deed? What is sin?

52
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,935
What is time? What is Karma?

53
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:47,476
What is bond? What is delusion?

54
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,048
What is truth? What is perennial?

55
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,912
Where is change? Where is the path?

56
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,849
Who will lead us to that path?

57
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:03,688
Where is he? When will he arrive?

58
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,701
Why are the planets losing path?

59
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,136
A great man is about to be born.

60
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:58,248
Planets are falling into places
to make him a great man.

61
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,747
It never happened before.

62
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,046
A man like him was also
not born earlier.

63
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,920
Why are you falling at child's feet?
It'll reduce his lifespan.

64
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,611
What are you looking, Shankara?

65
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,617
I see a Sadhu there, father.

66
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,976
Shankara, I brought you here
at midnight, aren't you afraid?

67
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:23,177
If I was afraid,
why would I come with you, Swami?

68
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,784
God gave you just 8 years only.

69
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:28,923
Do you know that?

70
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,118
Now that you've told me, I know it.

71
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,594
What do you know?
You're 4 years old now.

72
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:39,601
4 years from <i>now...</i>
- I'll leave this body, right Swami?

73
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,767
Are you not afraid of death also?

74
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,140
Death is inevitable after birth.
Birth is inevitable after death.

75
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,282
What is inevitable,
why should we cry about it?

76
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:57,251
Great! You're here to teach the world,
how can you he scared of anything?

77
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,084
Did you bring this far
to tell me this, Swami?

78
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,195
No, to impart you the divine
knowledge of Srichakram.

79
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,663
If you do it with devotion,
Goddess of Wealth will come on your order,

80
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,631
and will not leave even if you say,

81
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,722
Everyone says my son would
become an ascetic.

82
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:49,165
If one offers prayers everyday to
Goddess Lakshmi what would he become?

83
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,001
A wealthy man!

84
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,172
What would my son become then?

85
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,944
He would become a wealthy
man of knowledge.

86
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,493
Looks like you've found a new game.

87
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,721
Game is old but I'm trying to
play it in another new way.

88
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,366
They say our shadow is death.

89
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,960
Generally death plays with us.

90
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,935
What if we play with death?

91
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,907
Goddess will come down!
Jambasura's head will break!

92
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:34,143
Break, one more word about our
religion, I'll break your heads.

93
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,047
To hell with you!

94
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,722
With centuries of history
for our pious religion,

95
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,881
what the hell is your religion?

96
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,960
Is there anything worth
in your religion?

97
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,257
Don't say like that, I'll hang you
to death with my sacred thread.

98
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,899
What the hell did you say?

99
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:54,094
Beat them. . . kill them!
I-low dare you talk about our religion!

100
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,796
I'll kill and bury you here!

101
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,770
I'll show you who am I!

102
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,637
Your religion worthless!

103
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,039
Stop...stop!

104
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,580
Don't stop!
Beat yourselves to death!

105
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,083
Population problem would ease
and country would prosper.

106
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,252
Stop...don't fight!

107
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,289
What happened, hubby?
What happened;

108
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:21,088
Shankara! Why so many differences
though generations are changing?

109
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,355
Clashes in the name
of communities.

110
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,764
Unleashing death in
the name of religions.

111
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,672
In human. . . uncivilized!

112
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,170
What happened;

113
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,039
Hubby!

114
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,851
Why are you crying;

115
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,951
Like birth, death too is
a celebration.

116
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,549
Pray to Lord Krishna.

117
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:17,980
Lord Krishna, I seek refuge in <i>you...</i>

118
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:23,716
Lord Krishna, bless <i>me...</i>

119
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,006
Lord Krishna...

120
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:05,632
Lord Krishna, I sing in your praise...

121
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:11,870
Lord Krishna, you chant is meditation...

122
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:33,794
Lord Krishna, you're knowledge...

123
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,749
Lord Krishna, you're the saviour...

124
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:04,250
Lord Krishna, you're the giver...

125
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,092
Lord Krishna, you're the bearer...

126
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:14,727
Lord Krishna, you're the creator...

127
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:22,096
Lord Krishna, you're the
one to merge with...

128
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,577
With centuries of history
for our pious religion,

129
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,840
what the hell is your religion?

130
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,144
Is there anything worth
in your religion?

131
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,150
What are you pondering over, Guru?

132
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,993
Every one of us must end up
as ashes one day.

133
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,997
I reduced my father to ashes
with my hands.

134
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,496
I'm thinking about how to
reduce ignorance to ashes.

135
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,843
Why don't you chant it?

136
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:45,985
Yesterday you used acute accent,
today you used it differently,

137
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,995
which is right?
Yesterday's or today's?

138
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,728
Hey boy! It's my damn thing!
Why don't you accept whatever it is?

139
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,302
I'll tell him.

140
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:59,101
You joined the class recently and
started correcting teacher himself,

141
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,006
you will become a great Vedic scholar.

142
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,045
I want to become a Sanyasi.

143
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,375
So be it!

144
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,393
Give me alms, mother!

145
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,062
Give me alms, mother!

146
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,009
God in my home is starving
for lo days now,

147
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:46,848
I offered this berry to God.

148
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,092
I can't offer anything else.

149
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:36,383
My son Shankara! I wish you get
married as a little boy.

150
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:51,872
Mother, I wish to become
a Sanyasi as a little boy.

151
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:21,037
Guru! Don't go further deep,
there are crocodiles.

152
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,582
Shankara will complete 8 years today.

153
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:36,420
Death is inevitable!
God gave him just 8 years only.

154
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,958
Mother. . . mother. . .
- Son!

155
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,189
Crocodile has caught me, mother.
- Mother!

156
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,095
Please don't enter the water, mother.

157
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,429
To increase his lifespan?
- Can increase another 8 years, but...

158
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,798
What am I to do now?

159
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:55,501
Someone must sacrifice 8 years
of their life to him.

160
00:23:56,201 --> 00:24:00,115
Who would do it?
- I...I'll sacrifice my life.

161
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,783
Mother. . . mother...

162
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,640
Tell him, you can become a Sanyasi!
It seems crocodiles will not hurt Sanyasis.

163
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,278
Mother, crocodile will leave
if you allow me to become Sanyasi.

164
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,244
Permit me, mother!

165
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,712
Permit him to become Sanyasi, mother.
- As you wish son.

166
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,475
I permit you to become a sanyasi, son!

167
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,893
<i>What' s this pk'; with mother, son'.?</i>

168
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,333
Neither I played with you
nor lied to you, mother.

169
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,096
The crocodile of bondage held me.

170
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,367
I accepted to become sanyasi
on your order.

171
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:02,670
Crocodile left me.

172
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,017
Son Shankara!

173
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,958
Promise your mother and go.

174
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:28,597
I must see you before I die, son!

175
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:34,076
You must conduct my funeral rites.

176
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:42,548
Put your hand on my head,
promise me and then proceed.

177
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,395
As you wish, mother!

178
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:23,852
You're getting so sentimental about
that child and his acts, my foot.

179
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,925
He'll roam around like
a squirrel for few days,

180
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:31,898
he'll start feeling hungry,
he'll come back home.

181
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,128
That's the word of Vedic scholar!

182
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,862
Didn't get me?

183
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,667
My word is like Veda!

184
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,502
I've one small wish in my life, hubby.

185
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:53,380
I wish to see you beg like sanyasi
in loin with a begging bowl.

186
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,154
Hail Lord Shankara!

187
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:03,129
Hail Lord Shiva!
What's your illusion!

188
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:41,504
Wow! What a great artwork
this nature is!

189
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:48,837
My heart is swept away by
its beauty, pomp and splendour...

190
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,021
Like kiss of festivities...

191
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:10,531
Like a lamp of wonders...

192
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:15,802
Like a soaring mat of delight...

193
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,705
Like some divine magic...

194
00:28:55,233 --> 00:29:04,745
Flowing waters of
wonderful waterfalls. <i>. .</i>

195
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,283
It's dancing to the
rhythm of ﬂames...

196
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:14,158
Like a desire of beautiful earth
joining the vast sky at horizon...

197
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,893
The nature is thrilled and taking
breathe amidst the bamboos...

198
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:23,028
As wind whistles like
a mischievous youth...

199
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:13,645
Like a union of all
living forms into <i>one...</i>

200
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:18,818
Becoming one power and one breathe...
like the holy monosyllable...

201
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,450
Why are you going that side?

202
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,752
What will happen if I go that side?

203
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,459
There's danger ahead.

204
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,126
Oh! Danger?

205
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,226
Then, I'll go that side only.

206
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,465
Looks like, he'll change the country.

207
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,892
Lord Shankara!

208
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:37,573
You don't look like an ordinary sage,
are you a sage king?

209
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,104
You're doing the act of
controlling fire, right?

210
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,746
Guru, I too want to learn this.

211
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:55,915
Come, I'll teach you!
Come, I'll show my prowess.

212
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,505
How is the valley?
- Wonderful!

213
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,532
If anyone falls,
he may never come back!

214
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,976
May be but if one has hope of
coming back, may try jumping into it.

215
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,677
Then, think so,
jump and come back.

216
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,248
If you come back, I'll teach you
all the knowledge I have.

217
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,324
If one gets educated,
anyone can come up in life.

218
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,106
I like you, Shankara!

219
00:32:55,707 --> 00:33:00,850
If 10 dedicated people like you
take on this society,

220
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,324
ignorance, duplicity, fanaticism
will vanish from this country.

221
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:11,433
Come, I'll impart knowledge to you.

222
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,005
Shankara has transferred his life
to another form.

223
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,235
His life in fish now.

224
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,767
8 years you gave him ends today!

225
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,448
Anyone can give another 8 years but...

226
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,848
I'll sacrifice another 8 years
from my life to Shankara.

227
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,630
What are those fishes telling?

228
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,637
Birth and death are same,
when will humans learn this?

229
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,075
Catch the bastards who are
torturing common people,

230
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:42,877
make them bend and
stand in a line,

231
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:48,150
rip out their skins, that's all!

232
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,859
Never show mercy on those
sons of bitches!

233
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:55,361
Yes, I'm her son!
She's my mother!

234
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,160
But still I'll not conduct her funeral.

235
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,169
To conduct her funeral,
I need a bag of money.

236
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,837
Then, more money for rites
and obsequies.

237
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,601
For feast, I need more money.

238
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,336
Money, more money,
I can't spend anything.

239
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,670
Corpse!

240
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,027
Bloody son!

241
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:38,201
I yearned so much for a son!

242
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:42,700
Will you refuse to cremate me
for giving birth to you?

243
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,937
<i>Hey you...</i>

244
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,213
I raised you with great
difficulty, son!

245
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,389
Are you finding it diﬂicult
to cremate me, son?

246
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,890
Mother!

247
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:04,398
When you wetted on me, I felt like
I took a holy bath in river Ganges.

248
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:12,440
Are you thinking about money
to conduct my funeral, son?

249
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:19,105
Tell me before I hit you
with slippers,

250
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,114
mother, please forgive me,

251
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,753
I'll conduct your funeral, tell!

252
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,854
Tell!
- Mother!

253
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,251
Tell son! Tell!

254
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,288
Tell!
- Mother!

255
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,927
I'll conduct your funeral, mother.

256
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:44,039
Do you think only toughness can
bring sense to humans?

257
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:51,273
These mountains, valleys,
forests, birds, animals,

258
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:56,779
currents, streams,
star, livers and rivulets,

259
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:06,617
all remain unpolluted as they were
when they came into existence,

260
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:11,163
only rnan...just only man,

261
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:17,638
he's building webs of castes,
clans, religions around him,

262
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:21,309
he's going crazy with selfishness,

263
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,540
I, my wife, my children,
my grandchildren,

264
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,580
and their future generations,

265
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,476
he amassing wealth to
last many generations,

266
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,189
<i>money...money...money...</i>

267
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:40,152
He's steeping down to any
low level for money!

268
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:45,991
Money took birth and humanity died.

269
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,662
To change this world of sin,

270
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:55,667
I gave up throne, kingdom,
queen and children.

271
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,679
Roamed all around the country
like a mad man,

272
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,082
I learnt mantras and tantras,

273
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:07,506
but I understood this power will not help
to win over evil or change the world.

274
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:16,896
Think, Shankara!

275
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:23,368
Think what to do to change
this world!

276
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,372
Think over it!

277
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,886
This is mother in Telugu, Mother in Hindi,

278
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,957
mother in Tamil,

279
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,220
mother in Malayalam,

280
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,091
mother in Kannada,

281
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,289
Mother...
- In Sanskrit!

282
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:53,401
Mother, our Shankara is
a scholar of eight languages.

283
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,139
May you be blessed with great teacher!

284
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,328
Who are you, son?

285
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:25,033
Form of eternal happiness,
hail Lord Shiva!

286
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,037
Have you come to me as an answer
to my prayers, Shankara?

287
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,434
I'm here to be blessed
as your disciple.

288
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,943
You're guru of all gurus!
In fact you've blessed me.

289
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,871
When I see you I feel like holy
Mt.Kailash is wrapped in saffron

290
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:08,301
You'll be well known as Paramahamsa,
a great philosopher!

291
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,309
Karma yoga is contemplation of duty.

292
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:18,085
Vignana yoga is knowledge of
scientific contemplation,

293
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,882
Pragathi yoga is progress of
contemplation of self confidence,

294
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:25,258
Karuna yoga is contemplation
of non-violence,

295
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,495
Buddhi yoga is
contemplation of speech,

296
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,761
Dhyana yoga is
contemplation of breathe!

297
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,172
I'm seen is so many mirrors,

298
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:50,115
though I'm seen in so many mirrors,
I'm not that many, right?

299
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,350
I'm only one!

300
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,053
They're all my images!

301
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:06,267
Supreme soul is one,
all others are his images!

302
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,865
This is the philosophy
of oneness Advaita!

303
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,874
A meeting of all religions
is going to take place in Kashi,

304
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,141
you must attend the meet,

305
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:25,545
and take the first step towards your
victory lap of changing the society!

306
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,881
May victory be yours!

307
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,769
Our caste is superior!

308
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,599
Our religion is the only religion!

309
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,401
No, ours is the religion of people.

310
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,566
Our religion is the religion of world!

311
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,679
Our religion is the religion
of intelligentsia!

312
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,746
Do you say ours is
a religion of fools?

313
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,078
You fool!
- How dare you say like that!

314
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,755
Stop it! What's this ignorance?

315
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,852
What's this darkness?

316
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:11,593
How long will you fight in the
name of castes and religions?

317
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,636
You're just a boy!

318
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:36,684
How dare you argue in a religious
meet before scholars like me?

319
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,292
Who are you?

320
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,190
I'm God!

321
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,389
Are you God?

322
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,158
You're really crazy!

323
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,461
I'll bring him down!

324
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:53,401
If you're God, then you must
know everything, right?

325
00:43:55,099 --> 00:44:01,539
Tell me, whether the insect under
my slipper will live or die!

326
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:04,919
Tell me!

327
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:09,688
It'll die!

328
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,392
It didn't die, did it?

329
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,263
Not at me, look there!

330
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:29,741
Now the frog will also die!

331
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:43,687
Can anyone tell what would
happen to the snake now?

332
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:53,526
I'll tell you! An eagle will
swoop down and take the snake!

333
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,339
Do you know what will happen next?

334
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,912
What else? Snake will die.

335
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,607
<i>No, “won't die, W“ h“
around Shiv a' s neck.</i>

336
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,616
Which Shiva?
- This Shiva!

337
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:18,988
If it doesn't happen as you say,
you're finished!

338
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,720
O snake, come!

339
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:29,564
If you've guts, dare fall on my neck!

340
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,569
Fall!

341
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,868
What's this?

342
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,766
Don't move, snake has fallen
around Shiva's neck.

343
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,506
Ask it to let go off me.

344
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:14,377
Tell it to leave me.

345
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:17,382
Say I'm Shiva, it'll leave.

346
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:19,610
I'm Shiva!

347
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,217
I'm Shiva!

348
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,330
Forgive me, my friends!

349
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:44,803
This is just magic to open your eyes.

350
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,245
Illusion is nothing but seeing
what really isn't there!

351
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,044
To get you out of such illusions,

352
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:58,819
I'm here to teach you the
philosophy of Oneness Advaita,

353
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,093
May you live a long life!

354
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,440
Greetings to Guru!

355
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:15,542
What have you studied?

356
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,303
Four Vedas, lo Upanishads, 80 Puranas!

357
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,507
Whatever I may have studied
I'm nothing but an anthill.

358
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,211
You know about yourself very well.
Indeed you're an anthill!

359
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,916
Look, how his face changed!

360
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,559
I repeated what he said!

361
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,353
He couldn't digest it.

362
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,589
If he can digest it,
that is philosophy of Advaita.

363
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,130
Move. . . move. . .
Saint is coming. . . move...

364
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,432
Go away!
Move. . . move. . . move away please!

365
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:01,979
Your disciples are asking me
to move away!

366
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:06,281
Don't you feel they're making a
mistake by asking me to move away?

367
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:11,615
It seems you're spreading
message that all are one!

368
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,623
One small question!

369
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:20,290
You're carrying a stick,
they're bowing in honour,

370
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,972
are they both same, sir?

371
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:25,636
Bad smell!

372
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,138
Another little dirty question.

373
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:34,078
You close your nose when you do penance
or for the bad smell of drinks,

374
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,979
is the gesture of closing
nose same for both?

375
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:42,082
Hey Swami! Lord Shiva is protector
of the worlds,

376
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,452
I'm caretaker of
burial ground in Kashi,

377
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:47,322
I say your Lord Shiva
and I are one and same!

378
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,258
What do you m'?

379
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,590
Hey low caste man!

380
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:55,094
Into these holy streets which are used
by scholars, sages and saints like me,

381
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:58,000
how dare you argue with me
after getting drunk!

382
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,164
Go away!

383
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,512
Just now I had sweet drink,
I'll tell you bitter truth!

384
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,476
I'm caretaker of burial ground,

385
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,949
people who told me to go away,

386
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:16,352
they've to come to me
in the last!

387
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,027
Will you go away or not?

388
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,465
Even the snake from Lord Shiva
didn't hiss at me,

389
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,862
how come you're hissing with anger?

390
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:30,036
Okay, I'll go away as you say!

391
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,370
I'll go further away!

392
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,712
I-low far I may go!

393
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:44,982
You're on the same earth
on which I'm!

394
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:47,148
Doesn't it defile you?

395
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:55,997
I'm under the sky,
you too are under the same sky,

396
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,895
doesn't it defile you?

397
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:07,675
The wind that touches this
low caste touches you too!

398
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,068
Is it okay to you?

399
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,686
You're taking bath in the same
river Ganges where I too take bath,

400
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,086
Is it not sin?

401
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,588
You say nothing is sin!

402
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,988
Forget all that!

403
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,097
Just tell me this,

404
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:40,101
you're asking to move away
this body of bones and skin,

405
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:46,277
or ever burning soul
which is inside this body?

406
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:30,213
Sage Vedavyasa!
How fortunate I'm!

407
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,383
This fortune belongs
to entire mankind.

408
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:39,222
I'm saying this swearing on
these holy scripts,

409
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,727
the world needn't fear for anything,

410
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:46,228
<i>hut. . .
- Bu?</i>

411
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:52,399
Lord Kasivishwanath along with
his consort Goddess Annapurneshwari.

412
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,080
Viveka Choodamani!

413
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,255
Sasthana Thrium!

414
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,117
Mother!

415
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:50,125
These holy texts reached the lap
of holy Ganges and to Lord Shiva.

416
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:54,294
Lord studied the texts many times.

417
00:54:55,558 --> 00:55:00,132
He kept it on his head and
danced happily in trance.

418
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,298
Mother!

419
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:07,406
Have it!

420
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,310
My child!

421
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:16,321
This country is known as land
of Dharma and Karma, right?

422
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,585
Is it right to call it
like that simply?

423
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,221
Those words must come true, right?

424
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,331
Look there!

425
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,692
Karma protects and punishes!

426
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:28,994
Karma will devour you!

427
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:35,735
Even God can't save you from Karma.

428
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,011
That's it! You saw it, right?

429
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,717
There's nothing in your hand,
you can't do anything,

430
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:45,443
it's impossible for you,

431
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:50,682
with repeated sermons few people are
making humans insensitive and lazy!

432
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,959
Everything is in your hands!

433
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:57,355
If you decide you can do anything.

434
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,693
It seems you must take
this message to people.

435
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,024
My lord told me.

436
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:07,537
Good people are those fight
for good causes for people,

437
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,368
I'm telling you this,

438
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,042
Young men like you must clench your fists,

439
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,040
you must rebel,

440
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:22,716
bend such people and
bring them to our path,

441
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:32,729
First, give the taste of Advaita
philosophy to Mandana Mishra of Prayag.

442
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,234
Blow the bugle of victory march!

443
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:48,248
What's your Karma to go on
repeat the word karma!

444
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,417
Give me alms, please!

445
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,788
He)' ignorant!

446
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,888
How dare you enter my home
without my pennission!

447
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:03,860
Who are you?

448
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,864
The obsequies you're offering
to your ancestors,

449
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,934
I'm the form of all their souls!

450
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:13,267
I'm a soul of souls!
- Not my foot!

451
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,775
Go away as you came!
If not I'll have to throw you out!

452
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:22,110
This mendicant came as guest on
your father's death anniversary.

453
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:27,448
It's your duty to wash the
legs of guest and offer him food.

454
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,797
I'm not here for food!

455
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:39,862
To beg you for a debate.

456
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,463
Debate with me?

457
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:51,108
<i>On my w a'; to here, your Gum
Kumara Neelabhat sad the same thing,</i>

458
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:54,476
he lost the debate and
merged with Lord Shiva.

459
00:57:55,972 --> 00:58:01,479
Whether you want to debate or
salute me, I'm leaving it on you.

460
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:08,323
I accept for the debate and
without a doubt say I'll be the winner.

461
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,487
You're twirling moustache
which you don't have,

462
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,225
you're imagining a victory
that will not be yours,

463
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:18,504
for me everything appears as one!

464
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:35,515
For this debate, I'm appointing my wife
Ubhaya Bharathi Devi as the judge.

465
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:45,194
I appreciate your gesture
of honouring women!

466
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,538
They say when husband is standing,
a wife mustn't sit.

467
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,205
I think my mother is sitting
to make you stand anyway!

468
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:06,817
He'll stand tall,
to say this I'm also standing.

469
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:08,546
Wow,

470
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:13,217
Such debates have rules
and regulations!

471
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:17,729
It's my duty to announce
rules as the judge.

472
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:24,403
While debating, never look up!

473
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,507
This is too much!

474
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:32,077
Don't use dirty words!

475
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:37,411
Don't make such hand gestures!

476
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,587
Don't say like that!

477
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,255
Don't laugh like that!

478
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,758
Don't stamp foot on ground.

479
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:56,294
How much ever the argument may be tough,
always debate with a smile.

480
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,431
I think both of you know this.

481
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:05,944
I know all this,
I did so that you'll know it.

482
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,342
<i>Got it'.?</i>

483
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,944
If my husband loses the debate,

484
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,620
if my husband loses,

485
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,619
he'll accept ascetic's life.

486
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:18,948
If Shankara loses.

487
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:24,131
He must give up ascetic's life,
marry and become a family man.

488
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:26,667
This is the challenge.

489
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:30,794
Hey young bachelor! You stand
to gain even if you lose,

490
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,497
you'll get a lovely wife!

491
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,634
These ﬂower garlands are magical,

492
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:42,811
the garland will wither
on the neck of the loser.

493
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:51,150
Victory to Mandana Mishra!

494
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:58,988
Isn't it like accepting defeat
and garlanding me?

495
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,667
Isn't it like taking
back steps in fear?

496
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,807
How can a greenhorn know
the power of a veteran!

497
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:13,106
Wow,

498
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:19,150
People call me a scholar
but you say I'm a greenhorn.

499
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:22,687
Scholar or greenhorn, all are one!

500
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,025
That's the philosophy of Advaita.

501
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:34,031
Always telling all are one,
what's this silly philosophy of oneness?

502
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,864
Scholars, at least you tell him.

503
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:44,308
Cry-laugh, anger-peace, fear-courage,
man-woman, nectar-poison!

504
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:47,971
How can it all become one?

505
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,875
Because everything was born from you!

506
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,550
Don't bite teeth in debate.

507
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:02,724
Don't sigh!

508
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,333
Don't stare!

509
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:15,901
Can you please explain how can
all can become one, young bachelor?

510
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:18,742
I'll not but make you accept it.

511
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:22,414
Observe it keenly.

512
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,086
This is Krishna,
this is Tungahhadra,

513
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,920
this is Ganga,
this is Yamuna,

514
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,090
this is Godavari,
this is Cauvery,

515
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:43,098
I filled this with water from all
the livers right before you,

516
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:47,436
now, separate the water of
different rivers in different vessels.

517
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,374
Are you playing fun with me?
How is it possible?

518
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:51,944
Fate!

519
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,671
With a smile!

520
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,612
Are you playing fun with me?
Fate!

521
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,184
How is it possible?

522
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:02,255
Impossible! Water from all the livers
have mixed to become one, right?

523
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:06,951
Likewise everything is one!

524
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,965
You're putting my mother
to great difficulty.

525
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:30,649
I mustn't bite my teeth and
make gesture like this!

526
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:46,897
Show you spread hand to everyone here.

527
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:59,479
Why is one very small and
big in different sizes?

528
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:00,841
Like your argument.

529
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:08,687
Hello, when your five fingers
are not equal,

530
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,849
how can everything be one?

531
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,724
Are you dazed?

532
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:24,629
Our proven philosophy of Karma
will not accept,

533
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:30,540
your illogical, meaningless
philosophy of oneness.

534
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:32,737
<i>Got it'.?</i>

535
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:34,575
But you will accept.

536
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:39,044
What did you offer to your
dead father yesterday?

537
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:40,685
'Pindam', food for dead!

538
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,223
What were you called as when you
were inside mother's womb?

539
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,223
'Pindam' (fetus)

540
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,171
What you offered for
dead father is 'Pindam'

541
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,676
what is inside mother's womb
is also 'Pindam',

542
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,974
that's okay, what were you called
as at your birth?

543
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:11,083
Don't you know that also?

544
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:13,411
With a smile!

545
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,421
Don't you know this also?

546
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:19,788
Infant!

547
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,087
When you grew up?

548
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:22,354
Boy!

549
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:24,828
Then, youth, old man!

550
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,831
When you die, you're known
as corpse, right?

551
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:29,526
This is unnecessary!

552
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,806
What's this unnecessary comment?

553
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:38,536
I'll make you accept necessary
and unnecessary are one!

554
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:42,409
Tell me what are you to your father?
- I'm his son!

555
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,642
What are you to your wife?
- Her husband!

556
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:45,717
If you've children?

557
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:49,015
What's this?
- Please answer me, sir.

558
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:50,213
I'll be father!

559
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:53,223
When your son gets married,
you get a daughter-in-law, right?

560
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:55,157
What are you to her?
- Father-in-law!

561
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:56,797
If she gives birth to a son?

562
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:59,466
Grandfather!

563
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,132
Isn't it surprising?

564
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:10,142
You were fetus, boy, son, husband,
father-in-law, grandfather,

565
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,641
and a corpse too!

566
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:15,011
When an ordinary fetus can
become so many,

567
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:21,051
creating this entire universe,
providing and protecting it,

568
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,087
that supreme power,

569
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:24,519
supreme God,

570
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,489
supreme soul,

571
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:29,996
why can't he be one?
Will you please tell me?

572
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:34,660
I got it.

573
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,666
I've realised everything is oneness!

574
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:41,272
<i>Shankara, I...</i>
- <i>Please</i> stop!

575
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,202
You haven't lost yet.

576
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:49,614
Only half of your garland
has withered.

577
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,617
I'm his better half?

578
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,355
He'll lose only after you
win over me too.

579
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:05,195
Do you agree to debate with me?

580
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:11,936
Mother you can start your debate.

581
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:18,409
You're a strict bachelor,
please listen to me carefully.

582
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,877
How many types of hugs are there?

583
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:25,047
How would the kiss of a maiden be?

584
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:27,878
How many types of romances are there?

585
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,045
What are they?

586
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:34,957
What is the motive of
union of man and woman?

587
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,597
Are these questions a mother
would ask her son, mother?

588
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:44,261
In debate, in gambling, in war,
as you say all are one!

589
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:51,273
There's no question of philosophy,
bonds, relationships.

590
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,144
Great!

591
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:58,482
I can answer your questions,

592
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:04,023
but I need little time to answer
it with experience.

593
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:04,816
As you wish!

594
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:09,419
Please get to know the answers
and come back.

595
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,595
You can go now.

596
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:38,714
King!

597
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:50,466
King, don't go on hunting
expedition today!

598
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,200
Planets are not favourable.

599
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:54,966
Is it?

600
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:58,974
But I don't believe in planets
and astrology.

601
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:04,074
Whether you believe or not,
please agree as royal priest says, Lord.

602
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:07,153
Don't go to hunt.

603
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,953
I'll go to hunt.

604
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,720
Even if you go, please don't go
to Nainisharanya forest.

605
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:17,695
I'll go to Nainisharanya forest only.
- Please try to understand, Lord.

606
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:21,594
You don't know what's in that forest.
- I know!

607
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:26,757
There are umpteen varieties of
trees and plants!

608
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:48,186
There are wild beasts!
I'll certainly go to that forest only.

609
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:52,197
I'll definitely hunt there.

610
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,860
I'll come back Victoriously.

611
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:00,473
We're going to Nainisharanya forest.
- Forest?

612
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,870
Yes, to Nainisharanya forest only.

613
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:33,063
A bachelor Sanyasi trying to learn
about love and <i>sex...</i>

614
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:37,905
No, it is not love and sex but
a holy union of creating new life.

615
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:41,140
I want to know and
I'll get to know.

616
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:54,755
Who are you?

617
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:59,497
You should be experiencing the pleasures
of a king with his concubines.

618
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:01,601
Why did you take to ascetic life
at this age?

619
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:03,667
<i>X Pa“) You'.!</i>

620
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,271
May you be blessed with long life!

621
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:09,541
No, I'll bless you!

622
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:16,948
May you experience all
the pleasures!

623
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:25,658
How can one get drunk and
come to hunt?

624
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,291
Don't know what would happen now?

625
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:42,970
Tiger! You're a tiger
and I'm a lion!

626
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,702
I'm a royal lion!

627
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,741
King! It's dangerous!

628
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:52,146
That's fun to me!

629
01:11:53,742 --> 01:12:00,591
Whether it is beast or maiden,
I'll tame them with my hands.

630
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,004
Tiger!

631
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:17,207
Guru, the king we just met has
been killed by a tiger.

632
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:22,946
I got an answer to the question.

633
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:26,279
I'll enter the body of dead king.

634
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:31,185
I'll experience the holy union of
man and woman to create new life.

635
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,349
Guru! Why this extreme decision?

636
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,155
This will lead to many more doubts
and complications.

637
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,356
Think over it again.

638
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:43,202
This is not the time to think.
I'll leave my body now.

639
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,863
Keep my body safely in the cave.

640
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:52,375
Protect my body by applying herbs.

641
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,377
I'll come back after 45 days!

642
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:16,900
I know it is an illusion...

643
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:22,906
I know life is a puppet show...

644
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:28,246
I know it is a story...

645
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:34,753
I know every story will reach
its logical end...

646
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:41,117
Know this will <i>end...</i>
know this is bound to happen...

647
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:45,595
I know death is inevitable...

648
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:51,599
I know this body will disintegrate
in this mud...

649
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:57,434
Though you know everything,
why do you get yourself trapped into it?

650
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:58,441
Illusion!

651
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:45,809
Hail His Royal Highness King!

652
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:01,365
My dear citizens! I'm not your king
as you think,

653
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:03,403
I'm one amongst you,

654
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:05,972
to tell you the truth, you all are me,

655
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:07,511
you are me!

656
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:10,413
This kingdom belongs to people,

657
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:12,984
it is for people, by people!

658
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:15,985
People are the real kings!

659
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:20,286
Government isn't a system
to rule over people.

660
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:22,292
People are the rulers!

661
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,431
We're servants of people!

662
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:34,136
This is our king's real face!

663
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,700
King..O King!

664
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:42,673
People are facing severe poverty,
please advise us.

665
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:45,148
Tell them to drink and sleep like me.

666
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:49,180
I hate people.

667
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:56,188
Tell them, I don't want to see those
creeping and crying faces.

668
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:58,058
My sweet darling!

669
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:02,032
King, you must perform your
duties as king, right?

670
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:07,230
I'll perform my duties as king
for my queens only.

671
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:20,643
Hail Lord Shiva!

672
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:24,586
I can see visible change in king.

673
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:28,592
It's true I've changed but
it's not so visible.

674
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:33,426
I feel like I'm here as a student
to learn few lessons from you.

675
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,431
Observe it.

676
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:36,432
What do you want to learn?

677
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,265
How many types of hugs are there?

678
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:41,606
How would the kiss of maiden be?

679
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:45,611
What is the motive of
union of man and woman?

680
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:48,943
Will you teach me the science of union
to unravel the secret of procreation?

681
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:03,628
Hail Cupid!

682
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:16,303
Hail beautiful thoughts!

683
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:28,146
Hail the victorious world famous archer...

684
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,484
hail the majestic man!

685
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,448
Science of love is holy and pure...

686
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:04,682
First lesson is rule of embrace...

687
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:14,968
<i>Embrace. . .</i>
- <i>Embrace...</i>

688
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:20,368
Sensual delightful pleasure...

689
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,700
Union of bodies...

690
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:27,176
Delight to every part of body...

691
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:29,645
An invitation to pleasure
that follows...

692
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:38,458
A prologue to sensual love making...

693
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,054
Sensual touch!

694
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:47,732
Sensual arousal!

695
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,394
Caressing!

696
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:57,405
Stimulating!

697
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:15,449
Mother!

698
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:16,680
You're sick!

699
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:18,983
Why don't you avoid going
to river, mother?

700
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:23,160
If I don't there,
would the river come to me, son?

701
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,825
Mother! River Poorna!

702
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:53,187
What's this? River has come
to our door step!

703
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,858
I can't believe this!

704
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:59,391
If Rama kept his father's promise,

705
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:01,500
our Shankara keeps the promise
to his mother,

706
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,533
this is our Shankara's grace!

707
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:06,034
I'm sure this is done my son.

708
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:10,532
May God bless you, son!

709
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:25,485
You bombarded a young bachelor sanyasi with
questions on love, sex and romance.

710
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:28,719
He'll never come back here.

711
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:32,730
You're underestimating Shankaracharya.

712
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:38,729
I feel Shankara is Lord Shiva!

713
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:08,931
Stop it!

714
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,100
Stop your chant of hymns!

715
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:12,764
There's no God!

716
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:15,504
Why are you building temples for him?

717
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:20,113
Why are you offering prayers?

718
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:23,548
I feel like laughing at you.

719
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:27,346
Hey King, if you can prove
there is God,

720
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:31,116
I'll quit being atheist and start
praying God and fall at your feet.

721
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:35,227
If not you must fall at my feet!

722
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:45,160
What's this?
What are you doing?

723
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,135
What's this?

724
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:51,874
What happened;

725
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:53,569
It's burning me.

726
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:56,477
It won't burn you at all!

727
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:02,679
It's burning me and
you say it won't burn me.

728
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:04,653
Are you making fun of me?

729
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:07,516
You say it's burning without
anything spicy.

730
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:11,653
Moreover you say is it fun?

731
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:13,996
Why don't you please show me
that burning sensation?

732
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,432
How can I show it you?

733
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:19,333
One who gets burnt experiences himself.

734
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:22,600
It is not possible to show others.

735
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:25,339
Hail Lord Shiva!

736
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,510
When you can't show your
burning sensation!

737
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:37,521
He's manifestation of
everything on this world.

738
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:43,793
He's courage, spirit, consciousness,
conscience and supreme truth!

739
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:48,025
How can I show Him to you?

740
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,867
You can see a mirage
but it is not there.

741
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,533
Air is not seen but it is there!

742
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,365
You can see sky but it is not there.

743
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:59,638
Stars are there in day time also
but you can't see them.

744
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:02,046
You can't see smell
but can sense it.

745
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:05,713
What is seen under lens isn't
visible to normal eyes,

746
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:07,885
that doesn't mean it is not there.

747
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:12,381
Likewise God too can
only be experienced,

748
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:13,548
if you know this,

749
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:16,352
God whom you say isn't there
will accept he's there,

750
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:18,725
and God is nobody else
but yourself!

751
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:19,729
You'll realise it.

752
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,241
Hail beauty!

753
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:32,742
Hail lovely maiden!

754
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:36,307
Hail country beauty!

755
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:42,911
King! People. . . our people are
in dire straits.

756
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:48,790
They're throwing me into
dire straits.

757
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:53,592
King, we're organising special
prayers for the welfare of people.

758
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:57,567
It would be very good if you
attend along with your family, King.

759
01:24:57,725 --> 01:24:58,829
Is it?

760
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:04,100
You carry on prayers there,
I'll carry on with my prayers here.

761
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:15,653
Everything is fine hut what brought
a dramatic change in our king?

762
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:20,122
King going out at nights!

763
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:22,726
Is it?

764
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:34,969
I got it!

765
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:38,974
He has entered this king's body!

766
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:45,410
I'll put the dice and
move my pawn.

767
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:50,682
I'll take over the holy
Kashmir Sarvagna Peetam.

768
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:17,844
<i>I know Veda...</i>

769
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:23,852
I know the lamp of Vedic philosophy...

770
01:26:24,712 --> 01:26:26,521
I know science...

771
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:32,123
I know who is permanent
and who is not <i>here...</i>

772
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:36,291
I know this is a bag of water...

773
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:39,199
I know this is a bag of air...

774
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:44,207
I know this bubble would
burst one day...

775
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:49,041
I know what is up above would
vanish into thin <i>air...</i>

776
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:55,349
Though you know everything, why do you
get yourself dirtied in the slush?

777
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:56,750
Illusion!

778
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:14,498
It's proved that some other man has
entered the body of our king.

779
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:16,234
King!

780
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:21,242
For the welfare of our people,
I'm taking a hard decision.

781
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:26,750
Kingdom is prospering,
people are seeing golden rule of Rama,

782
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:29,586
if this king has to be
like this openly,

783
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:32,847
if this rule has to carry on
like this only,

784
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,425
tell me what should we do?

785
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:40,760
The man who entered King's body
would've left his body,

786
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:45,170
the body would be somewhere.

787
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,771
We must find the body.

788
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:49,275
We must cremate it.

789
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:52,438
Then, our king will remain
as our king for life.

790
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,601
I too want that to happen.

791
01:27:54,602 --> 01:28:00,951
Minister, cremate anybody
you find in this kingdom.

792
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:05,782
<i>Father...father...father...</i>

793
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:10,963
He took two wives like me.

794
01:28:11,152 --> 01:28:12,290
But still he died.

795
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:17,125
He was wearing so many jewels,
his wives took away everything.

796
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:19,430
At least conduct his funeral rites.

797
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:23,872
He made more jewels for his
second wife, right?

798
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:25,375
Let her conduct it.

799
01:28:25,533 --> 01:28:29,310
Why should I do it? He made a gold
coin chain for you, right?

800
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:30,540
You conduct it.

801
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:33,185
He gave the house in
Jangala street, right?

802
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:34,318
You cremate him.

803
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:37,581
You took the fan-Inland
in Lingalapuram, right?

804
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:43,161
You cremate him.
- You cremate him.

805
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,160
Stop it!

806
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,493
We're here to cremate the body.
Pick the body!

807
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:53,700
How long will you exercise?
Finish it quickly.

808
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:58,708
This is the last exercise.
Corpse exercise.

809
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:04,078
He says corpse and exercise.
Pick the corpse!

810
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,247
He's not a corpse,
he's exercising.

811
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:09,854
That's a corpse exercise.

812
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:13,119
Exercise for a corpse,
my dear mad aunty!

813
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:15,523
Your husband is dead.

814
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:18,698
Hubby! Are you dead?

815
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:23,986
God! Is my husband really...
how nice it would be if he's dead!

816
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:31,941
How nice it is!

817
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,377
They say corpse exercise would
make you ﬂy in air.

818
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:36,913
I'm really feeling like
ﬂying in air.

819
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:38,880
Hey, he's still alive!

820
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:41,384
I'm dead!

821
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,549
It seems he's dead, pick him up.

822
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,056
What's this body?

823
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:53,960
This is not a body, he's our Guru.
- Guru?

824
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:55,396
Why is lying like that?

825
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:57,661
Not lying but doing exercise.

826
01:29:57,825 --> 01:30:01,864
Oh that! I got it.
This is corpse exercise, right?

827
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:05,238
Do you know about those exercises too?

828
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,812
Hey, better we know we know everything.

829
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:08,879
Come on, let's go.

830
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:12,313
They think we're ignorant
about exercises.

831
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:17,082
They'll find Shankara's body
and cremate it.

832
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:24,754
I'll become the head of Sarvagna Peetam.

833
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:29,033
He's finished!

834
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:31,431
Yes, I think you're finished.

835
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:35,438
Look there, soldiers are
coming empty handed.

836
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,972
What happened soldiers?
Where's the corpse?

837
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:41,670
That's not a corpse but a man
doing corpse exercise.

838
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:44,282
You brought us unnecessarily
to forest.

839
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:53,120
Ignorant! Those scholars
cheated you easily.

840
01:30:54,582 --> 01:31:01,124
That's a body without life,
a lamp without oil!

841
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:04,796
<i>Earth is gone...</i>

842
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,462
It is devastated...

843
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:10,970
It's gone...everyone knows...

844
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:15,012
O mind, there's something
which is still unknown...

845
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:26,689
Though many said they know...

846
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:31,661
It's not yet decided whether
it's there or not...

847
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:41,333
It seems we must close both eyes
and open the third eye...

848
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:49,843
Sky, earth, mountain, valley...
it seems everything must appear as <i>one...</i>

849
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:58,513
It seems we must know the players
and the director are <i>one...</i>

850
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:05,530
One you realise this truth...

851
01:32:15,396 --> 01:32:18,536
The illusion will vanish!

852
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:02,915
Mother, my education is over.
Please bless me.

853
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:06,254
Please tell me one thing.

854
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:10,090
<i>Who are you in my hush and' s body'.?</i>

855
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:19,762
King will remain with you
as half of your body.

856
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:22,936
Hereafter rule the kingdom yourselves.

857
01:34:46,414 --> 01:34:47,415
Hail Lord Shiva!

858
01:34:48,282 --> 01:34:49,022
Mother!

859
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:54,959
Hereafter Mandana Mishra will
achieve fame as Sureshwarulu.

860
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:56,192
We're blessed.

861
01:34:56,457 --> 01:35:00,030
Let's awaken the nation that has
fallen into despair!

862
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:04,040
Blow the conch of revolution
to start our victory march!

863
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:12,043
Srisailam, Andhra Pradesh

864

I installed Srichakram in

906
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:56,819
the box here will receive donation

907
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:08,325
Your brightness shows you've
the blessings of Goddess of wealth.

908
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:12,103
Why don't you pray to mother?
She'll rain you with gold.

909
01:37:12,259 --> 01:37:15,297
You can happily go around in
chariots and palanquins.

910
01:37:15,462 --> 01:37:17,339
Why do you want to trouble yourself?

911
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:22,846
Ascetics don't need comforts and pomp.

912
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:25,176
<i>God bless you long...</i>

913
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:50,428
I'm blessed my son...I'm blessed.

914
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,934
You never left me alone.

915
01:39:03,203 --> 01:39:06,150
I see only you in everyone I meet.

916
01:39:17,584 --> 01:39:26,971
Son, I heard you did so much
for this world,

917
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:30,135
will you do just one thing
for your mother?

918
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:31,867
Tell me, mother.

919
01:39:35,436 --> 01:39:37,313
When I'm still alive,

920
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:46,319
I want to see the plays of
Lord Krishna and die happily, son.

921
01:39:47,715 --> 01:39:48,819
As you wish, mother.

922
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:58,335
Lord Krishna of Dwaraka...

923
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:26,358
With the witness of millions souls
who took refuge in <i>you...</i>

924
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:33,402
You're omnipotent, omnipresent
and in breathe...

925
01:40:34,294 --> 01:40:41,041
You're the protector of
five basic elements...

926
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:46,201
Show your plays as song and dance
that moves and shakes the world...

927
01:40:52,579 --> 01:40:59,497
Show it to mother...

928
01:40:59,653 --> 01:41:02,327
Plays are many not just one or <i>two...</i>

929
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:03,729
What am I to show?

930
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:07,566
I'll tell you hut you must show it
right now here to mother, okay?

931
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:10,265
Would people like you take
a no easily?

932
01:41:10,431 --> 01:41:14,072
I'm always at your command!

933
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:19,081
When mother asked on hearing
you ate mud as you eat butter...

934
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:23,915
You got caught to your mother
and for her love and devotion...

935
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:29,078
You opened your mouth to show
the 14 worlds to your mother...

936
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:41,267
Show that to mother...

937
01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:53,302
You stole saris of young Gopikas and
told them to pray lifting their hands...

938
01:42:09,723 --> 01:42:14,723
You honoured friendship hut eating
puffed rice and blessing with riches...

939
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:34,491
With 16000 Gopikas
and 8 young wives...

940
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:40,496
You romanced and loved
but remained a bachelor...

941
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:47,997
It seems as a symbol of this,
you sported peacock feather on crown...

942
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:55,180
To mesmerize this world,
it seems you play ﬂute...

943
01:42:55,402 --> 01:43:02,342
You showed your gigantic form
as Parthasarathy...

944
01:43:02,509 --> 01:43:08,687
You imparted philosophy
in your every ploy...

945
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:17,200
Show it to mother...
Bless her with eternal bliss...

946
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:40,214
Let me see mother!

947
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:49,892
You blessed mother with liberation,
give liberation body of mother.

948
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:57,737
Shankara is a sanyasi, how can he
conduct funeral rites of his mother?

949
01:43:58,065 --> 01:44:01,239
If he does it, this place will turn
into a cremation ground.

950
01:44:04,271 --> 01:44:07,582
They don't know that you
don't know anything.

951
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:10,885
You keep quiet.
This is an issue of men.

952
01:44:11,044 --> 01:44:13,581
Keep quiet! Are you a man?

953
01:44:14,181 --> 01:44:18,254
If not what else,
he learnt lo languages as a kid,

954
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:23,094
to save people from ﬂoods,
he impounded river Narmada in a jug.

955
01:44:24,324 --> 01:44:27,931
He made river Poorna to ﬂow
near house for his mother.

956
01:44:28,662 --> 01:44:32,337
Don't think such a great scholar
wouldn't know this small thing?

957
01:44:32,499 --> 01:44:35,275
If you go against scripts,
the place will turn into a desert.

958
01:44:35,435 --> 01:44:39,577
Yes, though Shankaracharya is Guru to
the world, he's a defiled man for us.

959
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:44,553
Nobody must go to carry
the body or even to see it.

960
01:44:44,711 --> 01:44:46,782
This is my order.

961
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:50,285
God, I beg for fire.

962
01:44:51,551 --> 01:44:53,792
My mother has died.

963
01:44:54,087 --> 01:44:57,625
I want to conduct her funeral,
please give me fire as alms.

964
01:45:03,096 --> 01:45:05,804
My mother is dead.

965
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:09,971
I want to conduct her funeral,
please give me fire as alms, mother!

966
01:45:17,344 --> 01:45:20,484
Are you giving him fire?
Come inside!

967
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:21,659
<i>Son'</i>

968
01:45:25,385 --> 01:45:28,832
Mother, my mother is dead.

969
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:34,735
I want to conduct her funeral,
please give me fire as alms, mother!

970
01:45:36,997 --> 01:45:40,672
You're a sanyasi,
mother of a sanyasi!

971
01:45:41,068 --> 01:45:44,174
Is she mother or anything else...

972
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:45,942
Get lost, man!

973
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:14,159
Acharya! Alms please!

974
01:48:27,734 --> 01:48:29,839
Order me what do you want?

975
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:33,012
I want you to sacrifice your life.

976
01:48:33,206 --> 01:48:35,516
You want yourself, so be it.

977
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:53,198
Withdraw your charm!

978
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:05,541
Sir, you please carry on.

979
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:16,226
I took this extreme step in the desire
to head Sarvagna Peetam of Kashmir.

980
01:49:16,483 --> 01:49:19,555
You're the world Guru who
deserves to head that Peetam.

981
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:24,232
Go to Kashmir by next
full moon day of Karthik month,

982
01:49:24,658 --> 01:49:27,571
you must head that seat.

983
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:30,230
Hail Lord Shiva!

984
01:49:32,799 --> 01:49:34,301
My dear people of this congregation!

985
01:49:34,434 --> 01:49:38,883
This is the holy seat of
Kashmir Sarvagna Sharada Peetam.

986
01:49:39,205 --> 01:49:44,951
The man who wins over the scholars
present here with his arguments,

987
01:49:45,111 --> 01:49:47,216
he can sit on that throne.

988
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:49,758
You can carry on with your debate.

989
01:49:51,051 --> 01:49:53,497
What? What?

990
01:49:53,687 --> 01:49:54,927
Debates?

991
01:49:56,456 --> 01:49:59,926
Look at him once!
You know who he is, right?

992
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:02,599
Aadi Shankaracharya!

993
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:09,104
Walking from Kanyakumari
to Kashmir 4 times,

994
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:17,620
Otaking on and shredding elders,
scholars of all religions, castes,

995
01:50:18,211 --> 01:50:26,357
and established the philosophy of
oneness of Advaita throughout the country,

996
01:50:26,486 --> 01:50:27,226
he's the lion of spiritual philosophy.

997
01:50:28,622 --> 01:50:34,538
That throne belongs to him!

998
01:50:34,728 --> 01:50:35,399
Indeed!

999
01:50:36,262 --> 01:50:38,333
Aadi Shankara is that worthy scholar,

1000
01:50:38,498 --> 01:50:42,640
I didn't say that but great Vedic
scholar Bhaskara said so,

1001
01:50:43,269 --> 01:50:46,011
great philosopher Neelakanta said so,

1002
01:50:47,374 --> 01:50:50,150
great scholar of Dharma
Prabhakar said so,

1003
01:50:51,211 --> 01:50:53,487
great debater Mandana Mishra,

1004
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:56,992
another great scholar
Abhinavamuktha said so,

1005
01:50:57,450 --> 01:51:02,450
scholars of every sect in India fell
at his feet and sought his refuge,

1006
01:51:10,096 --> 01:51:15,341
is there anyone better choice than
him in this august assembly?

1007
01:51:16,936 --> 01:51:18,006
There's no one!

1008
01:51:19,239 --> 01:51:21,344
Knowing well there's no one,

1009
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:25,479
if by mistake if anyone
wants to stand up,

1010
01:51:25,612 --> 01:51:28,354
I'm asking them to think over
it again for a moment,

1011
01:51:29,215 --> 01:51:31,525
I know Shankara from the
day he was born,

1012
01:51:32,585 --> 01:51:35,031
in fact I know him before
he was born,

1013
01:51:36,322 --> 01:51:41,322
he did great penance from childhood to drive
away ignorance and meanness from society,

1014
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:53,279
'Aparanochabhuti, 'Atmabodha',
'Anandalahari, ' Brahmasutrabhashyam',

1015
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:57,582
'Panchikarana Prakfiya',
'Upadesa Sahasri', 'Brahmageetha',

1016
01:51:57,744 --> 01:51:59,951
with more than 200 such books,

1017
01:52:00,113 --> 01:52:06,894
he gave to the world a new philosophy
of oneness known as Advaita.

1018
01:52:07,053 --> 01:52:08,498
This great philosopher.

1019
01:52:09,289 --> 01:52:14,034
People who know this know there's
no better choice than Shankara,

1020
01:52:14,194 --> 01:52:16,731
I know they too know this.

1021
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,341
You got it, right?

1022
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:24,740
Shankara was born with a reason and
he's the only one qualified to sit on it.

1023
01:52:25,505 --> 01:52:26,245
No!

1024
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:33,350
Shankara who accepted the holy
pious life of a sanyasi twice,

1025
01:52:33,513 --> 01:52:39,259
I've seen him conduct his mother's
funeral as an ordinary man,

1026
01:52:39,919 --> 01:52:44,425
he broke the rules of
pious life of sanyasi,

1027
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:47,800
he's not qualified to sit
on that throne.

1028
01:52:47,961 --> 01:52:53,775
Hey Kapalika!
No use in shouting aimlessly!

1029
01:52:54,267 --> 01:52:59,444
A sanyasi means giving up
worldly comforts and pleasures.

1030
01:53:00,406 --> 01:53:02,181
Not humanity!

1031
01:53:02,342 --> 01:53:07,416
You accuse of seeing Shankara
conducting his mother's funeral, right?

1032
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:12,051
First let's decide what a sanyasi
should do and what not!

1033
01:53:12,218 --> 01:53:18,396
Can a sanyasi bow to his father or not?
- No!

1034
01:53:19,025 --> 01:53:23,804
Ever since I became a sanyasi,
my father bows to me.

1035
01:53:24,597 --> 01:53:30,206
A sanyasi must never bow to anyone
not only to his parents.

1036
01:53:30,370 --> 01:53:36,150
Skandapuranam, Kasikandam part,
Visweshwara Smruthi 11 chapter, 50th hymn,

1037
01:53:36,309 --> 01:53:40,917
It means a sanyasi must bow
to his mother as a rule!

1038
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:47,827
That's the meaning of the hymn.

1039
01:53:56,729 --> 01:53:57,833
You understood it, right?

1040
01:53:58,898 --> 01:54:02,675
One can snap the umbilical cord
between mother and child,

1041
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:05,840
not even ascetic life can snap
the bond of mother and child...

1042
01:54:11,911 --> 01:54:15,358
This is not philosophy but edict!

1043
01:54:15,548 --> 01:54:17,255
Well said!

1044
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:22,722
In just 32 years of age,
never before anyone did this,

1045
01:54:22,922 --> 01:54:24,595
you've achieved great things,

1046
01:54:24,724 --> 01:54:27,364
you showed to the world that age
of saints isn't a criterion,

1047
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:33,307
as youth, you raised the ﬂag high,
you're the wisest scholar!

1048
01:54:33,466 --> 01:54:38,643
Though he controls Goddess of wealth,

1049
01:54:38,771 --> 01:54:42,651
he never asked her a penny for his own,

1050
01:54:42,775 --> 01:54:48,054
this selﬂess, humble Yogi is only
one qualified to sit on that throne.

1051
01:54:48,815 --> 01:54:52,160
I know this! I wanted everyone
to know this,

1052
01:54:52,518 --> 01:54:57,263
to see Shankara sitting on
the prestigious Peetam,

1053
01:54:57,423 --> 01:54:58,493
I played this drama.

1054
01:54:58,658 --> 01:55:04,472
I'm announcing Shankaracharya
as Jagadguru!

1055
01:55:04,631 --> 01:55:09,580
Hail Jagadguru Aadi Shankaracharya!

1056
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:18,250
Stop!

1057
01:55:22,081 --> 01:55:25,255
Mother! Goddess Sharada!

1058
01:55:25,652 --> 01:55:31,603
I bow to your hand that gives
knowledge to this world.

1059
01:55:34,294 --> 01:55:42,611
To touch this seat, one must have
a clean soul as well as clean body.

1060
01:55:43,369 --> 01:55:47,317
Though a sanyasi, you entered the
body of another man,

1061
01:55:48,675 --> 01:55:50,848
you studied romance and love,

1062
01:55:52,412 --> 01:55:54,289
how will you justify his?

1063
01:55:56,849 --> 01:56:01,628
This incident which may astonish
the future generations,

1064
01:56:01,788 --> 01:56:03,631
I want your answer.

1065
01:56:05,525 --> 01:56:06,970
What's the meaning of your silence?

1066
01:56:09,829 --> 01:56:12,969
There is, mother! It has meaning
and substance too.

1067
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:18,815
Eons ago Matsyendra entered
the body of a king,

1068
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:20,315
and saved a kingdom,

1069
01:56:21,908 --> 01:56:26,982
scholars said it was according to dharma
and to save the kingdom he did so.

1070
01:56:28,648 --> 01:56:35,224
Lord Krishna, who loved 16008
Gopikas and wives,

1071
01:56:35,388 --> 01:56:39,336
we still accept him as strict bachelor,

1072
01:56:40,193 --> 01:56:44,005
I too entered another man's
body on the same lines,

1073
01:56:44,263 --> 01:56:48,678
to show to the world
how the rulers must behave,

1074
01:56:48,868 --> 01:56:52,645
adhering to the strict rules
of Katopanishad,

1075
01:56:52,805 --> 01:56:54,614
with the usage of Vajroliya system,

1076
01:56:54,774 --> 01:56:57,516
for the welfare of this world
and it's people,

1077
01:56:57,677 --> 01:57:03,855
the drama I played will never
break my vow of celibacy!

1078
01:57:05,351 --> 01:57:07,797
If my words are lies,

1079
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:09,228
it they're false,

1080
01:57:09,389 --> 01:57:11,869
even it there's slightest
of sin in it,

1081
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:15,835
in the witness of
sacred monosyllable,

1082
01:57:15,962 --> 01:57:19,034
may my head break into 1000 pieces!

1083
01:58:29,235 --> 01:58:32,705
Do you want to sacrifice few more
years of your life to Shankara?

1084
01:58:32,872 --> 01:58:39,790
No, my life will end today and
Shankara's life will end tomorrow.

1085
02:00:51,043 --> 02:00:52,249
I'm a great man!

1086
02:00:53,112 --> 02:00:54,614
I'm the only great man!

1087
02:00:56,082 --> 02:00:58,084
Everyone think so!

1088
02:00:59,085 --> 02:00:59,927
Why;

1089
02:01:00,853 --> 02:01:02,526
Because that is true!

1090
02:01:03,656 --> 02:01:05,431
Who thinks like that?

1091
02:01:05,791 --> 02:01:07,099
Inner soul!

1092
02:01:07,526 --> 02:01:09,767
Who is greater than inner soul?

1093
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:12,475
This is absolute truth!

1094
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:16,273
A truth that only sages and
saints of India know!

1095
02:01:20,873 --> 02:01:25,947
With my 32 years of life I too
realised an absolute truth,

1096
02:01:26,212 --> 02:01:32,458
life is nothing a fight with ignorance,
inequality, inhumane behaviour.

1097
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:37,699
There's nothing to lose
in dying while fighting.

1098
02:01:37,857 --> 02:01:40,303
Except the shackles of ignorance!

1099
02:01:42,028 --> 02:01:45,737
No use is fighting,
fight with tooth and nail!

1100
02:01:46,565 --> 02:01:49,444
Never underestimate the
power of youth!

1101
02:01:49,602 --> 02:01:51,980
They're centres of power!

1102
02:01:52,171 --> 02:01:54,173
Flow of consciousness!

1103
02:01:54,407 --> 02:01:57,320
Love is the supreme knowledge
which only they know it.

1104
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:02,820
Love is the only language
which entire world understands.

1105
02:02:04,383 --> 02:02:08,695
Love! Love as you love yourselves!

1106
02:02:08,854 --> 02:02:11,232
Love every living creature
of this world!

1107
02:02:11,624 --> 02:02:16,835
This is the dharma of Hindu!

1108
02:02:18,664 --> 02:02:23,010
This is orthodox Hindu custom!

1109
02:02:26,238 --> 02:02:29,014
This is tradition!

1110
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:40,226
Love is the only mantra that can bring
together people, nations, and planets!

1111
02:02:40,419 --> 02:02:43,957
Know the man next to you is God!

1112
02:02:44,156 --> 02:02:45,863
There won't be any jealousy then!

1113
02:02:46,225 --> 02:02:48,364
There won't he anything
to steal and hoard!

1114
02:02:55,401 --> 02:02:58,541
No more boundaries!
No more wars!

1115
02:02:59,271 --> 02:03:00,875
No more bloodshed!

1116
02:03:01,974 --> 02:03:03,112
No more religions!

1117
02:03:03,976 --> 02:03:08,550
Peace. <i>. .</i> only peace will exist!

1118
02:03:09,081 --> 02:03:11,061
Only peace will be there!

1119
02:03:13,719 --> 02:03:17,895
I'm leaving the four seats of
knowledge in your hands.

1120
02:03:18,524 --> 02:03:20,299
Protect it!

1121
02:06:10,663 --> 02:06:13,109
Nectar! Drink it!

1122
02:06:14,266 --> 02:06:16,075
Death will never come near you!

1123
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:25,583
Are you asking me to drink nectar for this
body which will get reduced to ashes?

1124
02:06:26,312 --> 02:06:29,122
Or for the ever burning soul?

1125
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:33,090
Hail Lord Shiva!

1126
02:07:04,116 --> 02:07:10,624
Lord Shiva is omnipresent
and omnipotent!
