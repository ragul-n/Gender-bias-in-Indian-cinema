1
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,875
Mohammad Hussain Rauf.

2
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:56,038
Businessman. Diplomat.

3
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:58,112
Possible ISI agent, sir.

4
00:03:58,385 --> 00:03:59,875
The biggest deal-maker..

5
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:01,887
..for Pakistani
intelligence agencies..

6
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:03,888
..and Indian politicians, sir.

7
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:07,889
Brigadier Sharma, corrupt as hell.

8
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:09,461
But we don't have any proof, sir.

9
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:13,898
Samar Singh.
- Yes, sir.

10
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,126
Power broker.

11
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:17,465
These days he cracks all the deals.

12
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:20,840
He's been spotted with Rauf
many times, playing squash.

13
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,668
What do you want to say, Brigadier?

14
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:27,845
Sir, Lashkar has increased
its activities in Kashmir.

15
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:29,613
Elections are coming up.

16
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,250
We have to find out
what they're going to do.

17
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:33,646
Then do what you have to.

18
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,912
What are you waiting for?

19
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,955
We have 103 agents in the valley.

20
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,348
Have your pick.

21
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,323
Sir, I need someone from outside.

22
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:42,860
Vikram Sabrawal.

23
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,869
'I was returning to
Kashmir after 18 years.'

24
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:01,303
'Those memories were
coming back to me again.'

25
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:04,645
'y ear 1989. The procession.'

26
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,581
'The chaos on the street.'

27
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,287
'Week-long curfews.'

28
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:13,485
'And the feeling of terror and
obsession for freedom in the people.'

29
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:37,083
'And during this period the
Maulvi of Kashmir was murdered.'

30
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,717
'And the cry for a long,
waging battle could be heard.'

31
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:42,421
We want justice.

32
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:44,886
What does freedom mean?

33
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:49,291
These cruel Indian
troops have openly..

34
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:51,956
..murdered the Maulana.

35
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:54,627
Infidels, savages!

36
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,464
Infidels, savages!

37
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:58,367
The Koran is our motive.

38
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:00,302
The Koran is our tradition.

39
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:02,432
And 'Jihad' ( Holy
struggle) is our means.

40
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:04,306
'Nara-e-Takbeer'.

41
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,412
'The security forces..'

42
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:17,649
'..couldn't differentiate
between the crowd of Kashmiris.'

43
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,920
We're in the war zone.

44
00:06:21,027 --> 00:06:23,928
Our enemies are present in
every place, every road..

45
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,999
..every village, and in
every house at all times!

46
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,532
Find him, and catch him !

47
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:32,298
If they don't surrender, shoot them.

48
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,234
Any questions?
- No, sir.

49
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:36,605
Any questions?
- No, sir!

50
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,348
What's wrong?

51
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:49,947
Take him.

52
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,952
Why are you taking him?

53
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:53,218
Where are you taking him?

54
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:55,485
Listen to me.

55
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:57,291
It's just a routine interrogation.

56
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,920
But.. - We'll release
him tomorrow morning.

57
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:00,465
No..

58
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,362
Where are you taking me?

59
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,436
What is my mistake?

60
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:09,671
Leave me..

61
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,385
'The defeat of
Russia in Afghanistan..'

62
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:32,226
'..made the
Kashmiri's grow courageous.'

63
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,892
Allah-O-Akbar!

64
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:38,002
Allah-O-Akbar!

65
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:42,602
The days of hurling stones and
pebbles at the police are gone.

66
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:46,545
Children, just like you've
memorized the verses of Koran..

67
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:50,909
..train yourself in
Pakistan with the same focus.

68
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:55,318
And whenever you feel like resting..

69
00:07:55,655 --> 00:08:02,857
..remember the injustice done
to your mothers, your sisters.

70
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:06,791
By the grace of Allah,
we'll surely win this war.

71
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:08,857
Next Friday, we'll meet at Pindi.

72
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:12,995
Next Friday, we'll meet at Pindi !

73
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:14,833
'The situation became so bad..'

74
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:17,433
'..that Kashmiri pundits were
compelled to part with Kashmir..'

75
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,070
'..leaving everything behind.'

76
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,214
'No one tried to stop them..'

77
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:26,910
'..and the reputation of
Kashmir was tarnished forever.'

78
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,225
'The ambience had changed.'

79
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:41,498
'A race that was known
for its non-violence..'

80
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:44,634
'..was now toying
around with automatic guns.'

81
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:48,674
Next Friday, we'll meet at Pindi.

82
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:51,107
Next Friday, we'll meet at Pindi. -
'Every youth wanted to be a martyr.'

83
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:53,676
'The people of Kashmir believed..'

84
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,610
'..that soon the flag of
independent Kashmir..'

85
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,546
'..would soar over Sri
Nagar's secretariat.'

86
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:55,207
The environment and
ambience can change anytime.

87
00:09:56,042 --> 00:10:00,638
Welcome to Kashmir, the most
dangerous place in the world.

88
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:04,216
And the most beautiful, sir.

89
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:19,058
You'll have to don a new
identity to crack this mission.

90
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,426
Gul Jehangir.

91
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:24,265
This name will give
you many opportunities.

92
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:27,299
Money is not a problem.

93
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:28,931
You'll get all you need.

94
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,900
This is a highly
confidential mission.

95
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:35,075
You can be in danger at
anytime and from anyone.

96
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,782
You can't trust anybody.

97
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:42,450
Nothing has changed in 18 years.

98
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:44,584
The same hatred and detestation.

99
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:46,386
God made heaven.

100
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,887
Man created hell.

101
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:51,789
This is the story of Kashmir.

102
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:25,729
Even if the whole of
Kashmir turns into a graveyard..

103
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:27,959
..there'll be just one
voice coming from the ground.

104
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,661
Freedom ! Freedom ! Freedom !

105
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:33,706
The blood of Kashmiris is
not the water of Jhelum..

106
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:37,038
..that it doesn't hold any
importance for the Indians.

107
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:41,509
Today is the day when Maulvi died.

108
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:44,144
It's possible that I
might be murdered as well.

109
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,451
But 'Jihad' will never end.

110
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:50,118
We've been fighting
this war for 18 years.

111
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:54,250
And we'll keep
fighting for years to come.

112
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,050
'Nara-e-Takbeer'.

113
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:57,494
'Allah-O-Akbar.'

114
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:58,791
'Nara-e-Takbeer'.

115
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:00,627
'Allah-O-Akbar.'

116
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,472
History is the witness.

117
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:11,074
'Whenever the water at the
Goddess's temple has turned black..'

118
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:13,945
'..calamity has befallen Kashmir.'

119
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,117
There has been so much
destruction already, Goddess.

120
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,485
What's left now?

121
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:23,444
There's a message
from 'Char Chinar'.

122
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:24,888
Rainawari Chowk.

123
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:34,957
These CRPF officials
have troubled us a lot.

124
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:37,631
Show me your ID.

125
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:40,471
Where are you coming from?

126
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,064
Where are you going?

127
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,140
See that, sir, didn't I tell you?

128
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,471
In our own house they
ask us where we're going.

129
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:49,140
Just answer me. Get that?

130
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,676
Don't slap me, sir.
- I shouldn't slap you.

131
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,779
Come out.

132
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:57,253
Then I'll shoot you.

133
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:59,689
Shall I shoot you?
- Yes, shoot me.

134
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,722
Rather than getting
beaten up everyday..

135
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:02,988
..it's best that you kill me.

136
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:04,620
You speak too much.
You speak too much.

137
00:13:04,697 --> 00:13:06,028
Forget it, sir.
- Just a minute.

138
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:07,327
Don't interfere..

139
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:08,900
..or else I'll shoot you both here.

140
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,263
And show that you
two were militants.

141
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,031
What do we want?
- Freedom !

142
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:14,198
What do we want?
- Freedom !

143
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:16,002
Don't move anyone.

144
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,266
Check everyone.

145
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:20,330
The situation has
become very tense..

146
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:22,600
..because of this blast.

147
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:24,699
The entire world's media..

148
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,243
..have their eyes on Kashmir.

149
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:29,806
Release a press note on our behalf..

150
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:32,041
..that is from the
ministry of Kashmir affairs.

151
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:34,518
''That we strongly
detest this blast..''

152
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,417
''..and the attack on Haji.''

153
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:38,116
''And we assure the people..''

154
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:40,215
''..that this time the
elections will be peaceful.''

155
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,261
''There isn't going
to be any problem.''

156
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:45,688
''And like every time,
we'll make the government.''

157
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:48,829
The attack on PKF's leader,
Haji Shah..

158
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:52,496
..claimed the life of his
party leader, Shabber Ali..

159
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:54,699
..and his driver.

160
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:58,107
Mr. Haji has requested
the people of Kashmir..

161
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:00,907
..not to stage any riots.

162
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:05,777
A press conference has been
called in PKF headquarters

163
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:26,630
Sir, we've heard
that your party leader..

164
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:28,230
..Shabbeer Ahmed is dead.

165
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:30,207
Who do you hold responsible?

166
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:31,937
The enemies of Kashmir.

167
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:34,410
Those who don't want
Kashmir to be liberated.

168
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:41,710
But, regretfully, I've lost
another dear friend of mine today.

169
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:43,288
Excuse me, sir.

170
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:45,119
Dhruv Raina, Zee news.

171
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:46,623
What.. what did you
say your name was?

172
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,020
Dhruv Raina, sir, from Zee news.

173
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:52,027
Sir, 17 attacks in 18 years.

174
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:53,622
And you escaped each one.

175
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,167
Is it a coincidence or what? I mean,
how would you explain this, sir?

176
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,233
It's the grace of Allah.

177
00:15:59,472 --> 00:16:00,496
One more question, sir.

178
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:03,632
When a leader like
you can be attacked..

179
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:06,869
..then how safe is
Kashmir for the people, sir?

180
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
I think you better
ask the people that.

181
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:17,087
How 7,00,000 Indian soldiers
are protecting the people.

182
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,121
And about the bomb blast.

183
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:21,056
Let me ask you..

184
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:25,224
..aren't there bomb blasts
in Mumbai, Ahmedabad or Delhi?

185
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:28,661
Sir, but terrorist groups like
the Lashkar-e-Toiba stage them.

186
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:36,537
It feels nice to see a
Pundit reporter after many years.

187
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:38,636
By the way, Mr. Raina.

188
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:41,603
How long have you been
reporting in Kashmir?

189
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:45,411
Sir, for about six months.
- Six months.

190
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:47,876
Do you know him?

191
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,883
He is a Pervez.

192
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:51,646
He was six months old..

193
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:54,454
..when he was locked up
in jail with his mother.

194
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:57,452
Your government didn't
allow his mother to feed him.

195
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:02,232
That means.. even a
six-month-old boy is a terrorist..

196
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,360
But, sir..
- But what, Mr. Raina?

197
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:07,971
For India, it's breaking
news if Aishwarya Rai..

198
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,770
..sees the moon or not.

199
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,002
But many women here haven't seen
their husbands for years together.

200
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:18,448
Why doesn't the media tell the
Indians about that, Mr. Raina?

201
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:20,513
No, you tell me this.

202
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,532
Hello.
- Hello.

203
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:48,411
What's wrong, why have you
come here after so many years?

204
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:55,076
I came here because
I was missing you.

205
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:57,822
You intelligence officers..

206
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,517
..always think that the
others are not so intelligent.

207
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,255
That's why there's so much
terror in the entire world.

208
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:05,562
Every man comes here with a motive.

209
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,827
I'm here on a mission.

210
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,101
Kashmir is going to burn again.

211
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,837
That's nothing new.

212
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,407
That's been happening
for the past 18 years.

213
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:18,636
Something big is
going to happen here.

214
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:20,706
Bigger than '89.

215
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:23,245
How can I help you?

216
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:25,709
I want to know about the blast.

217
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:32,648
Mahroof, open the door.

218
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,656
Urgent message.

219
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,020
Just a minute.

220
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:04,047
Oh, God.

221
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,586
Who attacked Haji?

222
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:09,590
How do I know? Ask
the one who did it?

223
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:16,231
Didn't you provide the
arms for the attack?

224
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,801
Whose order was it?
- I can't tell you.

225
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:25,639
Rascal, if you can't tell me..

226
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,906
..then you have no right to live.
- Open the door.

227
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:29,480
Mahroof, open the door.

228
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:34,179
My job was to deliver the
arms at Sabrina's house.

229
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:36,720
I don't know
anything other than that.

230
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,633
Radio all check-post.

231
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:56,902
A burqa-clad lady is
fleeing towards market.

232
00:19:57,076 --> 00:19:58,600
Catch her. Quickly.

233
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:15,010
Who are you?
- Messiah.

234
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:16,845
I just saved your life.

235
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:23,820
Why did you kill Mahroof?
- Why do to want to know?

236
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:27,959
What is your name?
- Gul Jehangir.

237
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:03,925
Brother, food is ready.
- Coming.

238
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:15,412
The military killed his father.

239
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:18,743
And the militants
killed his brother.

240
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:21,911
Yet he dreams of freedom.

241
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:25,280
What do we want?

242
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,327
Yelling or writing
about liberated Kashmir..

243
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,026
..doesn't get you freedom, sir.

244
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:39,627
One needs to make sacrifices,
like Shabeer has.

245
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,703
Look, this time I
want all the parties..

246
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:43,742
..to unite under one sovereign.

247
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:45,375
We'll have to fight together.

248
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,040
Goodbye.

249
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:48,904
Baba, Mahroof was a traitor..

250
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:50,846
..and I don't need anyone's
permission to kill a traitor.

251
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,747
Dear, how many
times have I told you..

252
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:55,285
..to learn to control your anger.

253
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:58,320
You shouldn't have gone there
without Badi B's permission.

254
00:22:58,724 --> 00:22:59,952
You should've taken
the Fatima Squad..

255
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,117
..or Pervez along.

256
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:03,194
She always loses her
control in a fit of rage.

257
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:06,125
I'm talking to her, Pervez.
You don't need to interfere.

258
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:09,792
But Baba.. - I've lost many
dear ones on this mission.

259
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:12,003
I don't want to lose you, dear.

260
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:15,131
Become a great
leader like your father.

261
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,800
The police is there for
other things. - y es, Baba.

262
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,705
I'll keep that in
mind the next time.

263
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,025
Hello.
- Hello.

264
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:37,824
How's everything?
- Everything's fine.

265
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:40,557
We've found Sabrina's home.

266
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,634
Mahroof had delivered the
arsenal to that address.

267
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,695
Prepare the Fatima Squad.

268
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:49,631
We'll conduct the
Friday prayers there. - y es.

269
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,142
And find out who Gul Jehangir is.

270
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,651
I've heard you stitch
uniforms for the army.

271
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:14,024
Look, mister.

272
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,397
The army provides junk to the
soldiers in the name of uniform.

273
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,694
But if the soldiers want
to spend their own money..

274
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,203
..and get a better
uniform stitched..

275
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:23,036
..then why does anyone
have any objections?

276
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:26,139
If the military doesn't have
any objections why will I?

277
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:29,210
But the junk that the
military sends to you..

278
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:31,448
..you sell it to the militants.

279
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:36,309
After all that's my business,
sir. My bread and butter..

280
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:38,149
And these clothes.

281
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:39,683
Who do you sell them to?

282
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:41,617
The military or the militants?

283
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:44,652
There are people
like me in Kashmir..

284
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,630
..other than the
military and the militants.

285
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:49,027
I had ten, still have three left

286
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:50,965
Would you like to buy them?

287
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,134
I will buy them.

288
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:56,830
But first.. information.

289
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,872
Who staged the blast?

290
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:07,847
The militants or the military?

291
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,780
This seems to be the
work of some agency or..

292
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:12,289
..someone from within?

293
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:14,783
Not the military or the militants.

294
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,521
How can you be so sure?

295
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:21,224
Sir, this is Rainawari Chowk,
no-man's land.

296
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,433
Here's Jaish, this is Al-Baddar,
and this is Hiz-ul-mujahideen..

297
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:29,099
None of these three will
attack here, that's for sure.

298
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:35,805
And, Lashkar.

299
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,406
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

300
00:25:38,483 --> 00:25:41,850
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

301
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:45,217
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

302
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,521
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

303
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:51,892
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

304
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:55,058
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

305
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,495
Greetings.

306
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:01,834
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

307
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:03,807
Welcome Khan sir.

308
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,669
Greetings.
- Greetings.

309
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:20,715
That's fine.

310
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:23,587
Rauf is taking care of all
the arrangements in India.

311
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:27,458
You'll get anything you want.

312
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:29,458
Have some tea.

313
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:32,193
The general was asking, whether..

314
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,933
..any specific date has
been decided for the mission?

315
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:37,441
By the grace of Allah, this time
'Diwali' (Festival of lights)..

316
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:39,443
..will come before
'Id' (Muslim festival).

317
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:42,270
For the time being,
ask the Kashmiri's..

318
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,872
..not to indulge in any
suspicious activities.

319
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:49,084
I don't want any blunders.

320
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:52,082
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

321
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:55,354
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

322
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,725
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

323
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,061
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

324
00:27:02,834 --> 00:27:04,062
He was trying to run.

325
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:05,466
We traced him.

326
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,767
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

327
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,205
You shouldn't try to run, son.

328
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,375
Come.

329
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:15,478
Here comes Lashkar! India,
you're doomed !

330
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:38,092
#The hope of
achieving it was lost!#

331
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:44,466
#But the happiness in our heart
knew no bounds when we achieved it.#

332
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:50,444
#Salutations to Life!#

333
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:55,612
#We are together and may
we always be together.#

334
00:27:55,687 --> 00:28:01,455
#Thats all we pray.#

335
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:07,157
#May our love
bloom in abundance.#

336
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:14,001
#This we tell the LORD !#

337
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:31,417
#The hope of
achieving it was lost!#

338
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:37,054
#The hope of
achieving it was lost!#

339
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:43,063
#But the happiness in our heart
knew no bounds when we achieved it.#

340
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:45,695
#Salutations to Life!#

341
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:49,032
#Salutations to Life!#

342
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:52,270
#Salutations to Life!#

343
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:57,077
#Let us all live in
brotherhood together.. #

344
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:03,050
#.. in this orchard of ours!#

345
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:09,287
#Our dream of peace shall
stand true together.. #

346
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:15,355
#.. in this orchard of ours!#

347
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:33,108
#Salutations to Life!#

348
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:29,964
Where is Sabrina?
- I don't know

349
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,684
The leader of Fatima Squad,
Aziza Ansari..

350
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:46,554
..exposed a shocking sex
scandal in Srinagar today.

351
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:49,525
The shocking piece of
information is that the person..

352
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:51,562
..behind this organised
sex scandal, Sabrina Malik..

353
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:54,689
..is linked with a
well-known political family.

354
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:57,257
Come, let's find out
from these girls..

355
00:30:57,335 --> 00:30:59,565
..the reason, the
helplessness behind this step.

356
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:01,002
We're destined to be molested.

357
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,236
Who do you hold responsible?

358
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:04,639
Everyone's the culprit.

359
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,511
The military.. they do it by
holding their guns. - y es.

360
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:11,013
And the leader, by
promising us freedom. - y es.

361
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:14,950
This new aspect of
Kashmir really is shocking.

362
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:17,521
Have the political parties,
struggling for freedom..

363
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:20,420
..resorted to
prostitution and pandering?

364
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:23,256
Mr. Haji, what's going on in
the valleys in your presence?

365
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:24,852
Such news of sex scandals..

366
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,693
..are ruining the
mission of Kashmir.

367
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:29,097
Don't forget that
you're given this fund..

368
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,759
..for the liberation
of Kashmir and 'Jihad'.

369
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:33,929
We aren't involved in this.

370
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,734
But you can control it.

371
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,774
We don't want any
activities until the elections.

372
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,375
Unless authorized by us.

373
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:41,104
Goodbye.

374
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:44,479
Aziza, you've crossed
all limits of insolence.

375
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:47,484
Baba, I didn't know that they
were running a brothel there.

376
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:50,286
Why did you have to go
there without my permission?

377
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:52,854
Badi B, Mahroof had delivered
the arsenal to someone there.

378
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:54,323
Do you know, Kashmir
is being defamed..

379
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:55,859
..because of your actions?

380
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:57,485
And what Sabrina is doing..

381
00:31:57,562 --> 00:31:59,052
..is it something to feel proud of?

382
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,121
Kashmir is an international issue.

383
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:04,858
The entire world
watches every step of ours.

384
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,932
And the ruination of
innocent Kashmiri girls..

385
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,529
Aren't you worried about that?

386
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:13,099
A wretch like Sabrina should
be gunned down at Lal Chowk.

387
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:16,476
Aziza. Learn to stay
within your limits.

388
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,652
Ask Pervez to
arrange for her security.

389
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,933
Who is it?
- Gul Jehangir.

390
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:47,677
Don't look back, two
people are following you.

391
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:51,542
Where are they?

392
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,049
I don't see anyone.

393
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:55,484
But I can.. you, as well as them.

394
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:56,952
Keep walking.

395
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,260
There's a butcher's shop
on your left, go inside.

396
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,672
Come out from the back door.

397
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:21,935
Wait there.

398
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,710
Now come out.

399
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:37,720
Walk towards Dal Lake

400
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:43,864
Come to cafe Murad.

401
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:28,603
Who were those people following me?

402
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:31,472
They were Pervez's men.
- Impossible.

403
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,051
If you don't believe me,
they're lying right there.

404
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:36,410
You can ask them when
they regain consciousness.

405
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:39,418
Who do you work for?

406
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:41,482
I was jobless earlier.

407
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,552
But these days I have a job.

408
00:34:43,828 --> 00:34:45,295
Protecting you.

409
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,463
First, I saved you from the police..

410
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:49,227
..and today from Pervez's men.

411
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,767
What do you want?

412
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:53,060
Where was Mr. Haji going
on the day of the blast?

413
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:56,973
Believe me, our motive is the same.

414
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,307
From Jama Masjid to the Mosque.

415
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:02,677
And after that, I don't know.

416
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:06,645
Who was with him?
- Shabeer Ali, Pervez..

417
00:35:06,718 --> 00:35:08,049
..and many other leaders.

418
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:09,618
Anything else?

419
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:12,053
Why are your eyes
filled with so much rage?

420
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:14,791
Every Kashmiri inherits it.

421
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:17,251
One more thing.

422
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:22,395
You're very beautiful,
just like Kashmir.

423
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:25,198
This is only the external beauty.

424
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:28,102
If you look inside,
you'll be scared.

425
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,604
It's best that we stay
away from each other.

426
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:33,605
Goodbye.

427
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,917
Kashmir hasn't changed at all.

428
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:46,247
It's still heaven.

429
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:49,354
Look, Mr. Rauf,
you don't understand.

430
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:51,527
Everything's going
according to the plan.

431
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:53,323
Except for you, Mr. Samar.

432
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:55,965
Look, when we've
already fixed a deal..

433
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:59,093
..that you'll give the machinery,
we'll execute it.

434
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,001
Then why are there extra expenses?

435
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:05,233
Look, please solve your
internal problems yourself.

436
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:07,042
Why are you loading it on us?

437
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:09,306
We spend 30 crores
every year on Lashkar..

438
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:10,779
Did we ever ask about that?

439
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:14,910
Look, the ministry,
police, forces, agencies..

440
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:16,714
..everyone's involved in this.

441
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,650
We'll have to fill
everyone's pockets.

442
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:23,617
So? Everyone's going to make
profits after this mission.

443
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:26,460
Do you know how much the budget..

444
00:36:26,664 --> 00:36:29,326
..of the goverment, ministry
and intelligence will increase?

445
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:31,794
Take a seat. Let me
explain it to you.

446
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:33,436
And look here.

447
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,804
Look here.

448
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,406
Military intelligence, 100 crores.

449
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:40,603
Intelligence bureau, 100 crores.

450
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:43,439
J&K, separate.. 300 crores.

451
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:46,115
That means, your government..

452
00:36:46,217 --> 00:36:49,516
..is spending 500 crores
on Kashmir every year.

453
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:51,746
And that's been going on
since the last 18 years.

454
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:53,924
Give him the total.

455
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:55,856
9000 crores.

456
00:36:56,694 --> 00:36:59,527
Rs.9000 crore.

457
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:03,489
And the budget for the agency..
that is unlimited.

458
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:06,261
I'm talking about
only Kashmir's budget.

459
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:08,439
And what we're
talking about right now..

460
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:10,906
..is about the whole of India.

461
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:16,413
Now you can calculate the profit..

462
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:21,282
..that you'll make
in the next 20 years.

463
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:35,691
There is no God but Allah.

464
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,100
And Prophet
Mohammed is his messenger

465
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:44,867
There is no God but Allah.

466
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:47,036
And Prophet
Mohammed is his messenger.

467
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:51,081
Six.. Seven..

468
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,248
Aziza.
- Eight.

469
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:56,253
Why was Pervez spying on me?

470
00:37:56,554 --> 00:37:58,681
He wasn't spying on you,
he was protecting you.

471
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:01,850
I can protect myself.
- It's Baba's orders.

472
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:05,255
Who was he?

473
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:08,855
Aziza, who did you just meet?
- Jehangir.

474
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:11,592
He saved me from the police..

475
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:13,000
..when I killed Mahroof.

476
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:14,561
Don't meet him again.

477
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:17,802
That's an order.

478
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:06,382
Yes.
- Yes.

479
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:11,552
How are you?
- Fine.

480
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,869
When did you return from India?
- Two days ago.

481
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:24,434
Delhi, Jaipur..
even went to Jodhpur.

482
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:27,706
I had a look at all the jails.

483
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:30,672
There's no record anywhere.

484
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:35,247
More than 10,000 are missing.

485
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,220
And there's no record of anyone.

486
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:47,097
Whenever I come back..

487
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:53,135
..every one looks at me with
hope to know about their kin.

488
00:39:55,006 --> 00:40:02,674
And all I give them
is sorrow and despair.

489
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,681
Everything will be fine soon.

490
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,830
Hello.
- Hello.

491
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:26,369
Aatif, the food-grains have arrived.

492
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:28,939
The cement will arrive by evening.

493
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,335
Zaaka, when will you
finish building strong homes?

494
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:33,441
Aatif, it'll take
at least two months.

495
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:34,671
I see.

496
00:40:34,746 --> 00:40:36,839
That means they haven't had
enough of bullets and abuses..

497
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:38,905
..that now you want
them to die of cold.

498
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:40,314
Finish it quickly.
- Sure.

499
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:43,486
Salman, have you
fixed the radio yet?

500
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:46,486
The radio is ready, Aatif.
Everyone's waiting for you.

501
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,927
Greetings.

502
00:40:54,132 --> 00:40:56,293
Greetings.

503
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:00,528
You didn't go to school today?

504
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:04,438
You've a holiday
- Greetings.

505
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:09,006
How are you? Fine?

506
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,813
Fine.
- Fine.

507
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:16,042
How far have you
arranged for Sakina's marriage?

508
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:18,688
Son, you've made
all the arrangements.

509
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,881
We're only waiting
for Ahmed to return.

510
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:23,159
Aatif, we're ready..

511
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,124
Mother here talk with him.

512
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:34,099
Greetings, son. Are you fine?

513
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:37,664
Will you be attending
Sakina's wedding? - I am, Mother.

514
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:39,073
This is all I can take, Mother.

515
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:41,939
The condition here is worse.

516
00:41:42,346 --> 00:41:44,075
There're no allies here, Mother.

517
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:46,173
Come back, son.

518
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,917
Everyone's waiting for you.

519
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:49,577
They're waiting to come back.

520
00:41:49,687 --> 00:41:51,154
And we're waiting to
return to our family.

521
00:41:51,255 --> 00:41:52,950
Sir, we should report him.

522
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:56,452
No. He's not a terrorist.

523
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:01,298
They're normal people who
keenly went to Pakistan.

524
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:04,691
And want to come back now.

525
00:42:07,238 --> 00:42:10,230
Three weeks more, I'll
leave for my home as well.

526
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:14,436
I'll be far away from this madness.

527
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:21,708
Sir, do you get fits as well?
- Yes.

528
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,618
What else do you expect when
the salary's only Rs.7000?

529
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:30,119
Cook for yourself,
stitch uniforms for yourself.

530
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:34,122
And battle these
foolish terrorists as well.

531
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:39,564
It's called heaven. Heaven.

532
00:42:39,937 --> 00:42:41,632
Heaven.

533
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:44,140
The difference
between heaven and hell.

534
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:46,142
Just one bullet.

535
00:43:53,644 --> 00:43:55,874
Excuse me, matches?
- Get lost.

536
00:44:19,637 --> 00:44:22,663
Sir.
- The saffron reached to budd-shah.

537
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:24,340
Mother is returning
from Delhi tomorrow.

538
00:44:24,442 --> 00:44:25,602
She'll be here.

539
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:27,205
Deliver the goods.

540
00:44:27,878 --> 00:44:29,743
I'm sending the
children for training.

541
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:31,938
Be careful.

542
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:34,680
You'll get your share when
the goods are delivered.

543
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:40,949
Rauf. Good morning.
- Thanks for waiting.

544
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:46,724
So, all well?
- Fine.

545
00:44:46,897 --> 00:44:49,889
We need to open the border
for three hours. - 30 lakhs.

546
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:52,666
The rate's too high this time, Sir.

547
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:56,070
This time you need
more time as well.

548
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,105
You're getting the
border opened for three hours.

549
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:05,381
How many people?
- 30.

550
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,653
Add five more to it.

551
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:13,852
And send them in the end.

552
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:19,658
The army has to
achieve their target as well.

553
00:45:28,105 --> 00:45:30,073
How long do we have to struggle?

554
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,805
How much longer do
we have to fight..

555
00:45:32,877 --> 00:45:34,538
..to live
respectfully in our own country?

556
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:36,244
Sometimes I think..

557
00:45:36,313 --> 00:45:39,407
..freedom is only a dream.

558
00:45:42,086 --> 00:45:46,250
Aziza, you know, when I
was young mother would say..

559
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:53,290
..God tests his dear
ones more than others.

560
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:59,159
Who is Gul Jehangir?
- Why?

561
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:00,828
I don't know.

562
00:46:00,905 --> 00:46:03,465
Every time the elections come up,
we get to see new faces.

563
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:06,901
By the way, this time
you'll get to see a known face.

564
00:46:08,212 --> 00:46:10,305
You know what the
consequences can be.

565
00:46:10,414 --> 00:46:12,075
I already tried using the gun.

566
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:15,184
Let's try using
the ballot this time.

567
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:18,316
The motive is still
the same. Freedom.

568
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,716
What if something happens to you?

569
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:24,019
Then we'll meet in the other heaven.

570
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:32,726
# My heart desires you..#

571
00:46:34,505 --> 00:46:39,272
# But I cannot be
one with you..#

572
00:46:41,612 --> 00:46:46,879
# My heart
passionately longs for you..#

573
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:54,291
# But I cannot be
one with you..#

574
00:46:58,028 --> 00:47:01,293
# I am the falling night you
are the coming morning..#

575
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:05,365
# Inspite of being
together we still are apart..#

576
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:19,578
# Beloved. Beloved.#

577
00:47:24,588 --> 00:47:37,126
# It is you alone who is bound in
this chain of my cherished moments..#

578
00:47:38,669 --> 00:47:51,139
# It is you alone who has alwaysbeen
in every interpretation of my dreams.#

579
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:54,748
# I am the falling night you
are the coming morning..#

580
00:47:54,852 --> 00:47:58,618
# Inspite of being
together we still are apart..#

581
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:11,693
# Beloved. Oh Beloved.#

582
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:29,511
Yes.

583
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,520
I want the Haji blast case file.

584
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:33,112
The CIK has them.

585
00:48:33,424 --> 00:48:34,482
They won't give me the file..

586
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:35,889
..without knowing the reason.

587
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:38,018
And you know that is a
risk for our mission.

588
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:39,653
Who is the CIK chief?

589
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,429
SP Khan, but he won't cooperate.

590
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:45,931
In Kashmir, the system
works differently, Vikram.

591
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:47,298
That's the problem, sir.

592
00:48:47,404 --> 00:48:48,496
Damn-egos.

593
00:48:48,606 --> 00:48:49,732
The system sucks.

594
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,400
Give us justice or give us death !

595
00:48:52,543 --> 00:48:55,011
Give us justice or give us death !

596
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:04,677
Wait. Who do you want to see?

597
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:06,756
I've an appointment. Yusuf Khan.

598
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:12,653
Hello, sir, Yusuf
Khan wants to see you.

599
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:14,762
Okay, sir. Go in.

600
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:18,233
Give us justice or give us death !

601
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:19,667
Give us justice or give us death !

602
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,670
Return our kin to us.

603
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:23,763
Give us justice or give us death !

604
00:49:43,794 --> 00:49:46,319
Give us justice or give us death !

605
00:49:51,602 --> 00:49:53,797
Mr. Khan ! Mr. Khan !

606
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:55,129
Mr. Khan !

607
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:56,399
How many times have I told you..

608
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:57,997
..that it's futile to
come here, Parveena.

609
00:49:58,075 --> 00:49:59,474
The government is
paying you a compensation.

610
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:00,874
Rs.5 lakhs is not a small amount.

611
00:50:00,944 --> 00:50:02,502
Take the money and leave us alone.

612
00:50:02,613 --> 00:50:05,207
We don't want money.
We want our husbands.

613
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:08,345
Which Indian jail has him locked up?

614
00:50:08,452 --> 00:50:09,851
You've been to all the jails.

615
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,012
You didn't find him there..

616
00:50:11,088 --> 00:50:12,350
..so what can I do about it?

617
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:13,946
He must have gone across the border.

618
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:18,320
The military abducted him, Mr. Khan.

619
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:20,260
He was in your lock-up.

620
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:22,056
In your lock-up.

621
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:28,464
Mr. Khan. Listen, Mr. Khan.

622
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:31,372
Look, I'll try to speed
up the inquiry. - Inquiry?

623
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:35,044
Mr. Khan, you've been
inquiring for the past 17 years.

624
00:50:35,245 --> 00:50:38,476
Why don't you just say your
government has killed them?

625
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:41,277
At least, we won't have false hopes.

626
00:50:41,585 --> 00:50:43,553
As per our Islamic customs..

627
00:50:43,654 --> 00:50:45,053
..we'll get the rights of a widow.

628
00:50:45,122 --> 00:50:46,180
Get her out of here.

629
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,348
Get her out of here.
- Mr. Khan.

630
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:48,857
Mr. Khan. Mr. Khan.

631
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:51,258
At least, tell me
where he has been buried.

632
00:50:51,328 --> 00:50:53,387
We'll perform his last rites.
- Come with us.

633
00:50:53,497 --> 00:50:54,725
Mr. Khan.

634
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,062
Who did you sell this jacket to?

635
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:36,663
I have many customers.

636
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,435
How can I tell you who I sold it to?

637
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:48,750
Take your pick, what do you want?

638
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:23,819
Did you plant the bomb?
- I.. I didn't do anything.

639
00:52:23,887 --> 00:52:26,481
Even I'll say, ''I didn't do
anything,'' after killing you.

640
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:28,822
All I know is that..

641
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:30,558
..we had to blast the
car with the green flag.

642
00:52:30,661 --> 00:52:31,923
It was Pervez's orders.

643
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:42,703
Greetings.
- Greetings.

644
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:44,468
Come to Amina temple..

645
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:47,237
..if you want the name
of Anwar's murderer.

646
00:52:47,311 --> 00:52:49,245
Who is speaking?
- Goodbye.

647
00:52:50,113 --> 00:52:51,171
Who?

648
00:52:57,855 --> 00:53:00,085
Hello. y our job is done.

649
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:10,323
I was looking for you.

650
00:54:10,894 --> 00:54:13,192
Thank you very
much for this meeting.

651
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:17,194
Rascal.

652
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:19,031
Aren't there enough police here?

653
00:54:19,102 --> 00:54:21,593
Or, are you the police?

654
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:24,030
Why don't you show yourself?

655
00:54:24,107 --> 00:54:26,007
You gave the orders
for the blast, isn't it?

656
00:54:31,248 --> 00:54:32,442
Don't rack your brains..

657
00:54:32,516 --> 00:54:34,609
..or else I'll blast
the entire building.

658
00:54:37,087 --> 00:54:39,749
Tell me, why did you
stage a blast on Haji?

659
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:43,485
Feroze.

660
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:46,420
You'll be the target
for my next bullet.

661
00:54:46,563 --> 00:54:48,758
Tell me, who are you
planning to murder?

662
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:50,900
Rascal !

663
00:55:09,886 --> 00:55:12,320
We have to turn Kashmir into heaven.

664
00:55:14,591 --> 00:55:16,855
Aatif, you're taking the right step.

665
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:20,626
My vote will be for you.
- Thank you.

666
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:30,329
Today our identity..

667
00:55:31,475 --> 00:55:34,444
..is nothing more than an I-card.

668
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:37,874
We're supposedly living in heaven.

669
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:41,914
But the truth is for
the past 18 years..

670
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:44,817
..we've been living
in a beautiful jail.

671
00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:47,753
No freedom of speech..

672
00:55:47,858 --> 00:55:49,291
..or to think.

673
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,884
No freedom to live as we want.

674
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:04,033
Our children can't work outside.

675
00:56:04,107 --> 00:56:06,473
Because they're called militants.

676
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:09,506
And they can't work here..

677
00:56:09,613 --> 00:56:11,240
..because there are
no industries here.

678
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:13,506
And there won't be
any industries here..

679
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:15,585
..as long as we have
such selfish leaders..

680
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:17,779
..who don't want the
people to progress.

681
00:56:17,854 --> 00:56:21,585
Because evolving
people ask questions.

682
00:56:27,397 --> 00:56:31,390
The world is
constructing homes on the moon.

683
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:36,731
And we have to think twice
before stepping out of our home.

684
00:56:37,507 --> 00:56:40,237
We need to build same Kashmir..

685
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:46,046
..in which our children grow up
playing with toys and not guns.

686
00:56:47,317 --> 00:56:52,755
The Kashmir where children
grow up with their parents..

687
00:56:52,856 --> 00:56:55,086
..and not in orphanages.

688
00:56:56,827 --> 00:56:59,489
I don't promise you heaven.

689
00:56:59,896 --> 00:57:02,660
But I will make honest efforts to..

690
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:06,463
..get you out of this hell.

691
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:11,302
Vote for Gulmohar in
the coming elections.

692
00:57:11,408 --> 00:57:13,399
Say it aloud.
- We're one.

693
00:57:13,477 --> 00:57:15,411
Say it aloud.
- We're one.

694
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:17,674
What do we want?
- Freedom.

695
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:21,012
What does freedom mean?
- 'Allah-O-Akbar'.

696
00:57:21,084 --> 00:57:23,609
What do we want?
- Freedom.

697
00:57:23,687 --> 00:57:26,121
Freedom. Freedom. Freedom.

698
00:57:26,223 --> 00:57:28,088
Get the party of
Gulmohar out of our way.

699
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:32,485
Such people can be a
threat to our mission. - y es.

700
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:38,031
And.. the intelligence
has their eyes on Pervez.

701
00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:41,133
I've asked him to go underground.

702
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:45,030
And keep meeting Haji.

703
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:48,340
Keep showing them dreams of freedom.

704
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:54,116
You don't worry. Everything's
going according to the plan.

705
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,112
The goods are safe.

706
00:57:58,522 --> 00:58:00,615
And the training has commenced.

707
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:07,430
By Allah's grace, this time
we'll do what we couldn't in '89.

708
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:11,225
Aatif Hussain gave a
provoking speech..

709
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:12,791
..in a political rally today.

710
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:15,429
And instigated the
feelings of the people.

711
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:19,302
The police had to open fire to
bring the crowd under control.

712
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:21,604
And many people were injured.

713
00:58:21,845 --> 00:58:25,246
The Jammu & Kashmir police
have arrested Aatif Hussain..

714
00:58:25,315 --> 00:58:28,443
..under section 153 A
on non-bailable charges.

715
00:58:28,819 --> 00:58:30,980
There's already been a lot
of blood-shed in Kashmir.

716
00:58:31,054 --> 00:58:33,318
And I don't want
anymore because of me.

717
00:58:33,623 --> 00:58:35,989
Is this a pure political
gimmick or something else?

718
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:37,617
Only time will tell.

719
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:39,626
Along with cameraman Khursheed..

720
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:41,926
..this is Dhruv Raina,
for Zee news, Srinagar.

721
00:58:59,649 --> 00:59:00,980
Why did you call me here?

722
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:03,276
I want to tell you
something about Baba.

723
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,487
I don't want to hear anything.

724
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:07,420
Not even his attacker's name?

725
00:59:10,427 --> 00:59:11,621
Pervez.

726
00:59:11,995 --> 00:59:14,429
Baba has raised
Pervez like his child.

727
00:59:14,598 --> 00:59:15,860
It's impossible.

728
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:19,035
I'm standing at the
Makdoom saheb mosque.

729
00:59:19,402 --> 00:59:20,835
I won't lie.

730
00:59:21,238 --> 00:59:23,172
The reason for this
special attachment with Baba?

731
00:59:24,507 --> 00:59:27,908
Not Baba, with Kashmir.

732
00:59:29,412 --> 00:59:30,777
Goodbye.

733
00:59:36,186 --> 00:59:40,054
Sir, your guest has arrived.

734
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:43,186
Tell me how I've to treat it.

735
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:47,663
Exactly like a
criminal should be treated.

736
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,694
Yes, Aziza, what do you want to say?

737
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,962
Baba, I want to talk
to you in private.

738
01:00:28,104 --> 01:00:29,833
No one's a stranger here, tell me.

739
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:35,134
Your life is in danger.
- There's nothing new about that.

740
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:38,304
This time you're in danger
from your kin, and not strangers.

741
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:42,741
Say it clearly.

742
01:00:45,355 --> 01:00:50,657
Baba, Pervez.. staged
that attack on you. - Aziza.

743
01:00:52,329 --> 01:00:55,457
Do you know who you're accusing?
- Yes.

744
01:00:56,399 --> 01:00:57,957
Pervez gave the blast orders.

745
01:00:58,068 --> 01:00:59,763
You're crossing your limit, Aziza.

746
01:01:00,637 --> 01:01:02,502
You've been influenced
by that rascal Aatif.

747
01:01:02,605 --> 01:01:04,470
Aatif didn't tell me anything.

748
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:06,133
Then who told you all this?

749
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:10,841
The same one who saved my life.

750
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:13,444
I restrained you from meeting him.

751
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:15,510
Why are you meeting strangers?

752
01:01:16,152 --> 01:01:19,053
Have you forgotten PKF's principles?

753
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:21,813
Apologise to Badi B.

754
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:24,119
I can't do that.

755
01:01:26,963 --> 01:01:28,863
Baba, you don't see the truth.

756
01:01:30,934 --> 01:01:34,665
No, Aziza, I can't
pardon your mistakes..

757
01:01:34,738 --> 01:01:36,433
..calling it immaturity.

758
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:39,502
It's best that you..

759
01:01:41,945 --> 01:01:46,905
..choose a
different path like Aatif.

760
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:08,302
I hope her honesty
doesn't get her killed.

761
01:02:15,011 --> 01:02:22,747
#Bulla(sufi poet
Bulleshah ) says you are nothing #

762
01:02:25,455 --> 01:02:32,918
#I too agree
that I am nothing.#

763
01:02:34,464 --> 01:02:38,901
#Neither the country is mine..#

764
01:02:39,736 --> 01:02:43,536
#..nor does this
soil belong to me.#

765
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:54,712
#I am a wanderer in
my very own land.#

766
01:02:55,852 --> 01:02:59,686
#Who am I?#

767
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:04,824
#Who am I?#

768
01:03:06,096 --> 01:03:15,835
#Why am I a stranger
in my own world?#

769
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:20,703
#Who am I?#

770
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:22,637
In the name of Islam.

771
01:03:24,814 --> 01:03:26,441
In the name of pundit.

772
01:03:28,885 --> 01:03:30,944
In the name of Kashmir's honour.

773
01:03:32,856 --> 01:03:34,756
In the name of freedom.

774
01:03:36,226 --> 01:03:39,627
Everyone is involved.

775
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:11,523
''There's already been
a lot of bloodshed.''

776
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:13,619
''Aatif is the messenger of God.''

777
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:16,421
Wasn't that your motto?

778
01:04:16,733 --> 01:04:18,496
You've killed many people,
haven't you?

779
01:04:19,536 --> 01:04:23,336
I have, but not the innocent.

780
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,908
Only scoundrels like you.

781
01:04:27,076 --> 01:04:29,840
That's why Haji threw
you out of his party.

782
01:04:29,913 --> 01:04:31,904
'I can't work with the Lashkar.'

783
01:04:32,148 --> 01:04:34,708
'The Lashkar is an
integral part of our mission.'

784
01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:36,216
'I want to stop using the gun.'

785
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:37,878
'I hate it.'

786
01:04:37,954 --> 01:04:41,014
'They're against Islam.
- And you're against us.'

787
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:44,452
'It's a feeling of pride
to sacrifice your life..'

788
01:04:44,527 --> 01:04:46,256
'..for the cause of freedom.'

789
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:49,161
'y ou all sell dreams of freedom.'

790
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:52,466
'y ou've turned
Kashmir into a company.'

791
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:55,460
Traitor.

792
01:04:55,538 --> 01:04:58,666
You're going against the
very leaders you worked for.

793
01:04:58,741 --> 01:04:59,833
You'll bring liberation.

794
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:01,274
Become the messiah of Kashmir.

795
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:03,038
You want to be become
more affluent than Haji.

796
01:05:03,112 --> 01:05:04,670
You betrayer.

797
01:05:04,781 --> 01:05:06,408
Why do you want to
contest the elections?

798
01:05:06,482 --> 01:05:09,007
How much has Delhi offered you?

799
01:05:09,085 --> 01:05:10,916
How much have they offered you?

800
01:05:11,187 --> 01:05:14,816
You work for India but
the Pakistanis pay you.

801
01:05:14,891 --> 01:05:17,860
You ruin the reputation
of Kashmir at Lal Chowk..

802
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:43,251
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain.

803
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:45,219
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain.

804
01:05:45,288 --> 01:05:47,313
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain.

805
01:05:47,724 --> 01:05:49,316
Thousands of people have
taken to the streets..

806
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:51,757
..to protest against the
injustice done to Aatif Hussain.

807
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:54,762
And the daughter of
Maulvi Aziz Ansari..

808
01:05:54,864 --> 01:05:56,559
..and the leader of the Fatima
Squad, Aziza Ansari herself..

809
01:05:56,666 --> 01:05:58,327
..has formed an
alliance with the people..

810
01:05:58,434 --> 01:06:00,163
..to protest against the injustice.

811
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,431
Aziza will talk to us.

812
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,372
Aatif Hussain is fighting
for Kashmir and the Kashmiris.

813
01:06:06,442 --> 01:06:08,000
That too, without any weapon.

814
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:11,808
The crime he has been
arrested for isn't true at all.

815
01:06:12,215 --> 01:06:14,581
I request every Kashmiri..

816
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:17,586
..to speak for Aatif
Hussain's release.

817
01:06:17,654 --> 01:06:19,053
Thank you so much.

818
01:06:19,122 --> 01:06:20,851
This is Dhruv Raina, with
cameraman Khursheed, Zee News

819
01:06:20,923 --> 01:06:24,825
She's stubborn..
just like her father.

820
01:07:02,031 --> 01:07:04,499
What have these savages done to you?

821
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:07,999
That's what they're paid to do.

822
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:15,868
Anyway, I'm in much better
state here compared to Kashmir.

823
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:20,106
You can joke in this
condition as well?

824
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:22,611
Don't worry.

825
01:07:22,685 --> 01:07:25,677
Not just I, but entire
Kashmir is with you this time.

826
01:07:26,289 --> 01:07:28,689
The media will support
us for your release.

827
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:32,455
Look, we've started
a signature campaign.

828
01:07:37,934 --> 01:07:41,734
Aziza, do you know what
can be the consequences..

829
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:43,595
..of openly supporting me?

830
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,201
Haji will throw you out of PKF.

831
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:50,503
That will never happen.

832
01:07:52,715 --> 01:07:54,239
I've already left PKF.

833
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:56,214
Aziza, the one who
got me thrown in here..

834
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:59,083
..is none other than Rauf.

835
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:03,656
Look, I'm worried about you.

836
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,660
You need protection.

837
01:08:05,995 --> 01:08:07,963
Go to Dardpura for a few days.

838
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:10,294
Razaka and Salman will
make all the arrangements.

839
01:08:11,033 --> 01:08:14,434
Can I do anything for you?
- Pray.

840
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:30,646
We'll have to arrest Pervez
to know about operation 89.

841
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,317
I nearly had him.

842
01:08:32,622 --> 01:08:35,420
According to me,
Pervez staged the blast.

843
01:08:35,992 --> 01:08:37,619
I have a feeling, it has something..

844
01:08:37,693 --> 01:08:39,661
..to do with operation 89.

845
01:08:40,897 --> 01:08:43,229
Are you sure, Vikram?
- Positive, sir.

846
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:46,027
This is a part of a
very big conspiracy.

847
01:09:19,602 --> 01:09:24,369
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. Come in.

848
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:31,174
If you had informed me
I would've come myself.

849
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:36,647
Along with the Indian police.

850
01:09:37,687 --> 01:09:39,518
Do you know what's
going on in Kashmir?

851
01:09:39,622 --> 01:09:41,852
An arrest warrant has
been issued in your name.

852
01:09:41,924 --> 01:09:45,087
Stay here until the
situation simmers down. - Yes.

853
01:09:45,495 --> 01:09:47,520
You can stay with us.

854
01:09:47,997 --> 01:09:51,831
Now we don't know how to be
hospitable like the Kashmiris

855
01:09:52,034 --> 01:09:54,935
But we'll surely treat
you as well as we can.

856
01:09:55,104 --> 01:09:56,537
Give him some kebabs.

857
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:00,641
Here.
- Thank you.

858
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:06,747
You know, Pervez, after
fighting the 'Jihad'..

859
01:10:07,049 --> 01:10:08,641
..with the Russians,
we've made two strong allies.

860
01:10:08,718 --> 01:10:10,208
First is the American dollar.

861
01:10:11,354 --> 01:10:16,348
And the second is this AK 47.
- Sir.

862
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:18,820
Do you know why
it's called an AK 47?

863
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:21,820
Sir, I only know how to use it.

864
01:10:22,164 --> 01:10:25,133
AK means, 'Azad
Kashmir' (Liberated Kashmir ).

865
01:10:25,568 --> 01:10:27,126
Since 1947.

866
01:10:30,106 --> 01:10:31,630
Now, whether you
immerse it in water..

867
01:10:31,707 --> 01:10:34,767
..or keep it on ice, it
never betrays you. - Sir.

868
01:10:35,545 --> 01:10:36,910
Like you Kashmiris.

869
01:10:39,482 --> 01:10:41,507
There have been 17
blast attempts on Baba.

870
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:44,311
We don't know when the 18th will be.

871
01:10:44,954 --> 01:10:48,390
His life is in danger, and
he'll never accept that.

872
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:52,985
Uncle, we want to expose
the attackers of Baba.

873
01:10:53,362 --> 01:10:54,954
What happened on
the day of the blast?

874
01:10:57,066 --> 01:11:01,002
'Haji Baba, Pervez and
Shabbir came out of the mosque.'

875
01:11:01,637 --> 01:11:05,232
'Like every Friday, Haji Baba
stopped his car at the tomb.'

876
01:11:07,143 --> 01:11:09,008
'He bought a green
cloth from a hermit..'

877
01:11:09,211 --> 01:11:12,078
'..and I wonder why he asked for
it to be tied on to Shabbir's car.'

878
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:17,144
'All I know is that I had to
blast the car with the green flag.'

879
01:11:41,444 --> 01:11:45,039
Khan, Aatif is becoming
famous amongst the masses.

880
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:46,911
The longer you keep him in jail..

881
01:11:46,983 --> 01:11:49,144
..the better his image
will be for the masses.

882
01:11:49,986 --> 01:11:51,715
They can doubt me as well.

883
01:11:52,488 --> 01:11:54,183
It's better to set him free.

884
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:57,092
He can't harm us once he's out.

885
01:11:57,159 --> 01:12:02,597
But as long as he stays in the
jail he'll be a threat to us.

886
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,394
You better tell Rauf that.

887
01:12:05,901 --> 01:12:07,698
He got him arrested.

888
01:12:10,339 --> 01:12:12,136
Did you find out anything
about Pervez's murderers?

889
01:12:12,842 --> 01:12:14,469
The informers are trying.

890
01:12:15,044 --> 01:12:16,841
We'll let you know as
soon as we find out.

891
01:12:17,747 --> 01:12:21,706
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

892
01:12:21,817 --> 01:12:25,651
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

893
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:29,350
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

894
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:32,859
Tell me what happened that day.

895
01:12:34,497 --> 01:12:39,935
That day Shabbir and Haji
had a quarrel over some issue.

896
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,261
Shabbir wanted to
contest the elections..

897
01:12:42,338 --> 01:12:46,274
..and Haji accused him
that Delhi had bribed him.

898
01:12:46,509 --> 01:12:48,340
Where were they all going
on the day of the blast?

899
01:12:48,444 --> 01:12:50,537
They were on their way
to the Peer's house..

900
01:12:50,713 --> 01:12:52,146
..to find a
solution for the problem.

901
01:12:53,683 --> 01:12:56,151
But it's been ages since
the Peer forsake politics.

902
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:58,344
Why would he interfere?

903
01:12:58,587 --> 01:13:00,316
This is Kashmir.

904
01:13:00,423 --> 01:13:03,324
No one ever renounces politics here.

905
01:13:14,637 --> 01:13:17,504
Sometimes I feel as if I'm
just a morning newspaper to you.

906
01:13:18,307 --> 01:13:20,502
Why don't you come to
see me casually some times?

907
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:24,545
You're the only one in
Kashmir I can trust.

908
01:13:25,047 --> 01:13:26,810
I can call my friend.

909
01:13:27,917 --> 01:13:29,316
I was just joking.

910
01:13:29,418 --> 01:13:31,113
You understand the pain of Kashmir.

911
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,651
You're my brother.

912
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:34,115
Tell me, what is it?

913
01:13:34,223 --> 01:13:35,281
On the day of the blast..

914
01:13:35,357 --> 01:13:38,326
..Haji and Shabbir Ali
were coming to see you.

915
01:13:38,494 --> 01:13:39,961
It was their personal matter.

916
01:13:40,062 --> 01:13:41,495
They were coming
here to take advice.

917
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:43,691
The issue was so grave..

918
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:45,924
..that Haji murdered Shabbir Ali.

919
01:13:47,069 --> 01:13:49,333
Haji had staged the blast, isn't it?

920
01:13:49,705 --> 01:13:51,104
I don't believe it.

921
01:13:51,507 --> 01:13:52,838
They both belonged
to the same party..

922
01:13:52,908 --> 01:13:54,307
..so what was the quarrel about?

923
01:13:54,376 --> 01:13:56,037
Being in the same
party doesn't mean..

924
01:13:56,112 --> 01:13:57,841
..they think on the same level.

925
01:13:58,147 --> 01:14:01,605
They both had different intentions
about the upcoming elections.

926
01:14:01,684 --> 01:14:03,584
Haji wanted to
boycott the elections..

927
01:14:03,652 --> 01:14:05,882
..and Shabbir decided to
contest the elections.

928
01:14:06,222 --> 01:14:07,780
For sure, whoever
contests the elections..

929
01:14:07,857 --> 01:14:09,654
..has compromised with India.

930
01:14:10,526 --> 01:14:13,893
That means Delhi has
bribed Shabbir Ali.

931
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:16,461
This is Kashmir.

932
01:14:16,532 --> 01:14:18,796
This is a very big company.

933
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:23,028
They make crores of rupees everyday
so that this destruction continues..

934
01:14:23,405 --> 01:14:25,999
Maybe, Shabbir fell
prey to that as well.

935
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:27,839
Who knows..

936
01:14:28,277 --> 01:14:30,507
And Aatif?
- He has to die.

937
01:15:06,982 --> 01:15:08,643
You have to arrest Haji, sir.

938
01:15:08,918 --> 01:15:10,715
Not possible,
Vikram. Try to understand.

939
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:14,256
If we arrest Haji it'll lead
to exactly what happened in '89.

940
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:16,891
The riots. And the
obsession for freedom.

941
01:15:17,059 --> 01:15:19,186
Kashmir will burn again, Vikram.

942
01:15:19,261 --> 01:15:20,785
I don't understand you guys.

943
01:15:20,863 --> 01:15:22,854
No one arrests politicians.

944
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:24,832
Only the innocent Kashmiris
are the ones who get arrested.

945
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:26,700
I don't work like that, sir.

946
01:15:26,802 --> 01:15:27,928
You have to arrest Haji.

947
01:15:28,037 --> 01:15:30,733
Vikram, we want Rauf and not Haji.

948
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,205
He's the ISI agent.

949
01:15:32,274 --> 01:15:33,866
The link between Haji and Budd Shah.

950
01:15:33,943 --> 01:15:35,205
Then what's the big deal?

951
01:15:35,277 --> 01:15:38,246
Arrest him.
- Can't do it. Diplomatic immunity.

952
01:15:38,314 --> 01:15:39,713
Do you understand that?

953
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:52,680
Give this to uncle Rahim.

954
01:16:52,755 --> 01:16:54,484
For her daughter's marriage.

955
01:16:54,556 --> 01:16:56,251
And tell him that
Budd Shah has sent it.

956
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:58,020
For a loyal soldier.

957
01:16:58,694 --> 01:17:02,289
There's danger in Lolab valley.
- I know. Goodbye.

958
01:17:03,465 --> 01:17:05,433
Keep misleading the government.

959
01:17:05,668 --> 01:17:07,795
So that they never find us.

960
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:14,199
Peace in the valley can be
a threat for us. - Okay.

961
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,284
Stop. Stop.

962
01:17:58,687 --> 01:18:01,019
Maybe you don't realise..

963
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:03,558
..if the media and
masses find out about this..

964
01:18:04,259 --> 01:18:06,056
..it can lead to the
downfall of the government.

965
01:18:06,695 --> 01:18:08,026
Government?

966
01:18:08,397 --> 01:18:10,058
You'll directly benefit..

967
01:18:10,165 --> 01:18:14,659
..from the terror which
this mission will spread.

968
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:17,868
No pain no gain.

969
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:22,566
The more the people are scared..

970
01:18:22,878 --> 01:18:25,472
..it will keep adding to
your ministry's budget.

971
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:28,179
And I don't have to tell you..

972
01:18:29,718 --> 01:18:34,212
..that you're going to reap the
maximum benefits in such deals.

973
01:18:34,523 --> 01:18:36,616
You'll have the biggest cut.

974
01:18:37,693 --> 01:18:40,719
So get as much as you can.

975
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:41,412
I've decided to
boycott the elections.

976
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:47,654
And the price? - What
would be the price for heaven?

977
01:19:48,664 --> 01:19:50,325
Any amount is less.

978
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:56,899
Don't worry. y ou won't
lose anything in this deal.

979
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,736
Shall I have the money
deposited in the trust?

980
01:20:01,043 --> 01:20:03,307
And you don't have to keep
Aatif locked-up in the jail..

981
01:20:03,412 --> 01:20:04,845
..and make him a hero.

982
01:20:04,913 --> 01:20:06,210
Bail him out.

983
01:20:12,554 --> 01:20:14,112
Goodbye.

984
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:20,119
We don't want passports. No
one will cast their votes.

985
01:20:24,867 --> 01:20:29,497
Once again India has
announced the elections.

986
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:33,531
India has been
asserting the elections on us..

987
01:20:33,642 --> 01:20:38,841
..just to show the world.

988
01:20:39,114 --> 01:20:41,844
But what good will that do?

989
01:20:42,184 --> 01:20:45,745
Human rights violation has
been increasing every year.

990
01:20:45,854 --> 01:20:49,722
We won't endure the
brutality of the Indian army.

991
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:50,883
We won't tolerate it.

992
01:20:50,959 --> 01:20:52,051
We won't tolerate it.

993
01:20:52,127 --> 01:20:55,392
We don't want these
bogus elections, but freedom.

994
01:20:55,497 --> 01:20:57,795
These people who are
contesting the elections..

995
01:20:58,066 --> 01:21:00,000
..have been bought over by Delhi.

996
01:21:00,102 --> 01:21:02,696
Because they don't
want Kashmir to be free.

997
01:21:05,107 --> 01:21:08,440
But I, Haji Sayyed Shah..

998
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:14,349
..and true Kashmiris like you, won't
let them succeed in their motive.

999
01:21:16,852 --> 01:21:20,515
And today.. by
tearing this blue book..

1000
01:21:21,223 --> 01:21:23,953
..I announce the
boycott of elections.

1001
01:21:24,059 --> 01:21:25,822
We don't want passports.

1002
01:21:26,028 --> 01:21:27,325
No one will cast their votes.

1003
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:29,124
We don't want passports!

1004
01:21:29,231 --> 01:21:31,096
No one will cast their votes.

1005
01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:32,963
We don't want passports!

1006
01:21:33,068 --> 01:21:34,763
No one will cast their votes.

1007
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:47,078
So, Mr. Haji, will the
masses support you this time..

1008
01:21:47,149 --> 01:21:48,707
..or will they support Aatif?

1009
01:21:53,522 --> 01:21:56,082
Well, what do you think
about the Kashmiri Pundits?

1010
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:58,991
Will the Kashmiri Pundits
be able to vote this time?

1011
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,898
And yes, the masses are scared..

1012
01:22:08,003 --> 01:22:09,994
..because of your election boycott.

1013
01:22:10,072 --> 01:22:14,532
And they feel this will
lead to Kashmir's destruction.

1014
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:16,474
What do you have to say about this?

1015
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:18,609
Think positive.

1016
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:23,076
And pray that we
Kashmiris don't have to resort..

1017
01:22:23,552 --> 01:22:26,521
..to doing what we did
the last time. - y es.

1018
01:22:27,256 --> 01:22:31,750
Think positive about Kashmir,
Mr. Raina. - y es, yes.

1019
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:35,156
Kashmir wants freedom,
that's decided.

1020
01:22:35,264 --> 01:22:37,892
But will they choose the way
Haji Sayyed Shah has shown them?

1021
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,892
There are still two
thoughts about that.

1022
01:22:40,102 --> 01:22:41,899
We don't want elections but freedom.

1023
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:43,537
Aatif is a leader
who likes progress.

1024
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:45,664
He'll get us freedom and food.

1025
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:47,638
We've shed a lot of blood.

1026
01:22:47,709 --> 01:22:50,143
Aatif is the messenger of God.

1027
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:53,111
''Aatif is the messenger of God.''

1028
01:22:53,315 --> 01:22:54,907
According to our exit polls..

1029
01:22:54,983 --> 01:22:58,544
..Kashmiris want change, but
is Aatif Hussain that change.

1030
01:22:58,654 --> 01:23:00,121
Only time will tell.

1031
01:23:00,188 --> 01:23:01,314
Along with cameraman Khursheed..

1032
01:23:01,423 --> 01:23:02,913
..this is Dhruv Raina for Zee News.

1033
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:05,385
Fix a meeting with Aatif.

1034
01:23:06,528 --> 01:23:08,462
We'll have to form an
alliance with Aatif Hussain..

1035
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:11,124
..to win the elections in Kashmir.

1036
01:23:58,447 --> 01:23:59,914
Her husband.

1037
01:24:00,615 --> 01:24:02,276
It's been 18 years.

1038
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,414
He isn't dead.

1039
01:24:08,824 --> 01:24:10,382
Maybe.

1040
01:24:12,327 --> 01:24:14,488
Did the army abduct him?

1041
01:24:15,831 --> 01:24:17,731
Major Sharma.

1042
01:24:19,034 --> 01:24:21,468
They said they'll let him
go after a routine inquiry.

1043
01:24:22,304 --> 01:24:24,465
There was no news for two days.

1044
01:24:25,507 --> 01:24:27,600
And when I went there to inquire..

1045
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:30,334
..everyone.. all of them declined.

1046
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,738
They never abducted any Saiyed Loon.

1047
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:45,719
Allah has said, ''Have patience.''

1048
01:24:51,566 --> 01:24:53,329
I have a lot of patience.

1049
01:25:15,457 --> 01:25:17,482
Greetings, Mr. Rauf.
- Greetings.

1050
01:25:17,592 --> 01:25:20,117
I wanted to talk to
you about Aatif's bail.

1051
01:25:20,595 --> 01:25:23,063
We shouldn't have such
discussions on the phone.

1052
01:25:23,732 --> 01:25:25,632
Come home.

1053
01:25:25,867 --> 01:25:27,835
We'll discuss things there.

1054
01:25:28,737 --> 01:25:30,068
Goodbye.

1055
01:26:10,245 --> 01:26:11,576
Great.

1056
01:26:12,647 --> 01:26:18,176
How did you think of me today?

1057
01:26:19,721 --> 01:26:21,382
Aatif is in jail.

1058
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:23,985
And I've left PKF.

1059
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:26,650
Baba won't support me either.

1060
01:26:30,599 --> 01:26:34,501
Look, you don't look
nice when you're worried.

1061
01:26:35,737 --> 01:26:40,800
So, what can I do with you?

1062
01:26:46,715 --> 01:26:48,114
Why are you quiet?

1063
01:26:57,626 --> 01:26:59,526
Who are you? What do you want?

1064
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:02,222
What was the motive
behind Shabbir's murder?

1065
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:04,057
Why did you get Aatif jailed?

1066
01:27:04,165 --> 01:27:05,757
What are you blabbering?

1067
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:07,864
Look, I'm a businessman.

1068
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:09,266
And I only do business.

1069
01:27:09,437 --> 01:27:10,904
You're right.

1070
01:27:11,072 --> 01:27:12,869
You only do business but of Kashmir.

1071
01:27:15,844 --> 01:27:19,905
Spare.. spare me, please.

1072
01:27:20,382 --> 01:27:22,373
Tell me, what's
going to happen here?

1073
01:27:23,084 --> 01:27:24,881
What's the plan, tell me.

1074
01:27:25,186 --> 01:27:29,179
It's a plan to do something
similar to what happened in '89.

1075
01:27:29,257 --> 01:27:32,624
Tell me clearly.
- Freedom.

1076
01:27:32,694 --> 01:27:34,059
The world knows that.

1077
01:27:34,129 --> 01:27:35,391
Tell us what you know.

1078
01:27:35,463 --> 01:27:37,055
The Maulvi's death.

1079
01:27:39,234 --> 01:27:43,261
Haji and Maulvi both
wanted Kashmir's freedom.

1080
01:27:43,538 --> 01:27:46,063
But Haji wanted the
aide of Pakistanis..

1081
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:49,601
..and Maulvi wanted
the aide of Kashmiris.

1082
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:52,803
Their means were different,
but the motive was the same.

1083
01:27:52,881 --> 01:27:57,750
They both wanted
Kashmiris to come together.

1084
01:27:58,153 --> 01:28:01,782
And that was possible only
when there was a big incident.

1085
01:28:02,023 --> 01:28:03,820
Like the Maulvi's death.

1086
01:28:03,892 --> 01:28:05,757
But the army murdered father.

1087
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:09,285
Aziza, you respect
Haji like a father.

1088
01:28:09,798 --> 01:28:14,360
But the truth is..
Haji Sayyed Shah..

1089
01:28:14,603 --> 01:28:16,571
..is your father's murderer.

1090
01:28:26,314 --> 01:28:28,908
You can kill Haji if you want.

1091
01:28:29,284 --> 01:28:30,876
But if you kill him..

1092
01:28:31,086 --> 01:28:34,283
..he'll be accounted as a
martyr by the Kashmiris.

1093
01:28:34,623 --> 01:28:36,921
And his photo will be
put up on every wall..

1094
01:28:37,025 --> 01:28:38,720
..along with your father's photo.

1095
01:28:38,827 --> 01:28:40,852
Aziza, you need to do something..

1096
01:28:41,262 --> 01:28:45,858
..that'll make the Kashmiri's hate
him for the rest of their lives.

1097
01:28:48,503 --> 01:28:55,033
#O, Lord of the world.#

1098
01:28:55,677 --> 01:29:00,808
#Descend on earth.#

1099
01:29:00,882 --> 01:29:08,755
#Come and see for yourself.#

1100
01:29:09,357 --> 01:29:16,490
#How hatred's growing here.#

1101
01:29:51,866 --> 01:29:53,925
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

1102
01:29:54,035 --> 01:29:56,435
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

1103
01:30:01,242 --> 01:30:03,210
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

1104
01:30:03,278 --> 01:30:05,644
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

1105
01:30:08,149 --> 01:30:10,208
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

1106
01:30:10,285 --> 01:30:12,446
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

1107
01:30:16,524 --> 01:30:19,049
Say it aloud!

1108
01:30:19,327 --> 01:30:25,357
Leave me!

1109
01:30:34,042 --> 01:30:35,270
Leave me!

1110
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:13,389
We'll begin our
mission from the Jammu camp.

1111
01:33:14,035 --> 01:33:17,266
And three children amongst you
all will be selected for it.

1112
01:33:18,806 --> 01:33:20,296
You.

1113
01:33:22,543 --> 01:33:24,204
You, son.

1114
01:33:27,749 --> 01:33:30,411
And you will begin our mission.

1115
01:33:53,908 --> 01:33:55,466
How are you feeling now?

1116
01:33:57,712 --> 01:33:59,111
Better.

1117
01:34:00,481 --> 01:34:03,644
Aziza, I have to go.

1118
01:34:04,986 --> 01:34:06,112
Where?

1119
01:34:06,788 --> 01:34:08,085
Jammu.

1120
01:34:08,823 --> 01:34:10,791
I.. need to address the rally.

1121
01:34:11,225 --> 01:34:12,715
In the camps of the Pundits.

1122
01:34:13,328 --> 01:34:15,193
Aatif..
- Aziza, I'm going to do..

1123
01:34:15,263 --> 01:34:17,629
..what hasn't been
done in Kashmir for years.

1124
01:34:26,307 --> 01:34:27,740
Haji.

1125
01:34:29,344 --> 01:34:33,212
It's his speciality to
use people for his benefit.

1126
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,013
Haji will die as well.

1127
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,410
Like Pervez and Shabbir Ali.

1128
01:34:40,488 --> 01:34:43,924
Don't associate
Shabbir with these traitors.

1129
01:34:44,492 --> 01:34:47,484
He was a true
soldier of mission Kashmir.

1130
01:34:47,695 --> 01:34:48,923
Wrong?

1131
01:34:49,263 --> 01:34:51,322
You're unnecessarily
terming him as a hero.

1132
01:34:51,866 --> 01:34:53,857
There are no angels in politics.

1133
01:34:53,935 --> 01:34:55,493
Everyone has a price.

1134
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:57,435
Shabbir wasn't a traitor.

1135
01:34:57,505 --> 01:35:00,133
He wanted to contest the elections..

1136
01:35:00,241 --> 01:35:02,266
..to bring peace and
progress in Kashmir.

1137
01:35:05,079 --> 01:35:06,876
Anyway, let's forget this.

1138
01:35:11,486 --> 01:35:14,978
You lied to me.
- What are you saying?

1139
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:17,686
Shabbir Ali wasn't a traitor..

1140
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:20,226
..he was a true Kashmiri,
and you knew that.

1141
01:35:20,294 --> 01:35:21,818
Yet you didn't tell me that.

1142
01:35:21,896 --> 01:35:24,592
Look, Vikram, I told you all I knew.

1143
01:35:24,665 --> 01:35:26,656
I considered you my friend.

1144
01:35:27,702 --> 01:35:29,693
I thought you're a
loyalist of Kashmir.

1145
01:35:29,804 --> 01:35:31,897
But you've sold your
soul like the others.

1146
01:35:32,006 --> 01:35:33,098
What do you want?

1147
01:35:33,207 --> 01:35:34,799
Why did you kill Shabbir Ali?

1148
01:35:34,876 --> 01:35:36,309
What is operation '89?

1149
01:35:36,411 --> 01:35:38,675
I don't have any
connection with operation '89.

1150
01:35:38,746 --> 01:35:40,543
You do, you absolutely do.

1151
01:35:41,215 --> 01:35:43,240
You and Haji as well.

1152
01:35:43,885 --> 01:35:46,217
Maybe that's why
Shabbir Ali was killed.

1153
01:35:46,554 --> 01:35:48,078
What do you want?

1154
01:35:48,156 --> 01:35:49,555
Freedom.

1155
01:35:50,358 --> 01:35:54,124
Freedom. y es, I'm
linked to operation '89.

1156
01:35:54,729 --> 01:35:56,321
We're going to blast Jammu.

1157
01:35:56,964 --> 01:35:59,228
Will you be able to
stop it within 24 hours?

1158
01:36:00,968 --> 01:36:03,596
You know the
consequences of blasts in Jammu.

1159
01:36:03,905 --> 01:36:06,772
Jammu will turn into another
Kashmir.. - That's what we want!

1160
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:10,905
That's exactly what we want!

1161
01:36:11,512 --> 01:36:14,413
We want a Kashmir in
every corner of India.

1162
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:18,318
So that you can
endure our pain as well.

1163
01:36:19,087 --> 01:36:22,488
And understand what we've been
experiencing for the past 18 years.

1164
01:36:26,094 --> 01:36:27,721
You've gone mad.

1165
01:36:28,062 --> 01:36:29,859
You've gone absolutely mad.

1166
01:36:30,631 --> 01:36:32,121
Do you know the consequences?

1167
01:36:32,233 --> 01:36:34,133
It can't be worse
than what it is now.

1168
01:36:41,142 --> 01:36:43,702
Don't forget that the
ones you're going to kill..

1169
01:36:44,045 --> 01:36:45,535
..are Kashmiris as well.

1170
01:36:45,646 --> 01:36:46,943
And don't forget..

1171
01:36:47,048 --> 01:36:49,846
..that you fought against
the Pakistanis for them.

1172
01:36:49,917 --> 01:36:51,612
In 1947.

1173
01:36:52,353 --> 01:36:54,753
I'm going to stop the blast.

1174
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:57,890
You try to do the same if possible.

1175
01:37:00,061 --> 01:37:02,461
I'm helpless, I can't do anything.

1176
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:07,867
Aatif, History is the witness.

1177
01:37:07,969 --> 01:37:09,561
Only Delhi's desired candidates..

1178
01:37:09,637 --> 01:37:11,195
..have won the elections in Kashmir.

1179
01:37:11,272 --> 01:37:14,435
And that has been
happening since 1947.

1180
01:37:15,209 --> 01:37:18,042
This time history will change.

1181
01:37:18,613 --> 01:37:20,843
The favoured
candidate of the masses..

1182
01:37:20,915 --> 01:37:23,179
..will win the
elections in Kashmir this time.

1183
01:37:24,318 --> 01:37:26,252
This is politics.

1184
01:37:26,487 --> 01:37:28,682
How far do you think
you can fight alone?

1185
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:32,255
Look, you need an ally who
can get a national platform..

1186
01:37:32,326 --> 01:37:37,491
..for this small regional problem.
- Forget it.

1187
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:42,397
You know that you Indians
have created this problem.

1188
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:45,303
And we've understood that
you don't want to solve it..

1189
01:37:45,406 --> 01:37:47,738
..but play political games.

1190
01:37:48,442 --> 01:37:51,809
If you really want to
solve this problem..

1191
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,875
..stay away from Kashmir.

1192
01:37:55,082 --> 01:37:57,880
Operation '89 is happening
as I'm talking to you, sir.

1193
01:37:57,952 --> 01:37:59,510
Colonel Kapoor was right.

1194
01:37:59,754 --> 01:38:01,221
This is bigger than '89.

1195
01:38:01,289 --> 01:38:03,450
Vikram, give me all the details.

1196
01:38:03,558 --> 01:38:05,492
They have four lakh soldiers, sir..

1197
01:38:05,593 --> 01:38:07,652
..who have been trained
in 'Azad' (Free) Kashmir.

1198
01:38:07,762 --> 01:38:10,287
Other than that, they
have millions of militants..

1199
01:38:10,398 --> 01:38:12,696
..who are ready to attack.

1200
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,430
Their chief, Budd Shah..
We'll have to catch him, sir.

1201
01:38:18,105 --> 01:38:21,165
They want to spread terror
in every part of India..

1202
01:38:21,442 --> 01:38:24,309
..like they have done in Kashmir.

1203
01:38:25,413 --> 01:38:26,812
Don't be absurd.

1204
01:38:26,981 --> 01:38:29,973
We can't take such a big
decision on the basis of rumours.

1205
01:38:30,051 --> 01:38:32,315
And anyway, the
elections are so close.

1206
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:36,015
If we call off this rally the
Kashmiris will find another topic.

1207
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:37,990
They'll turn this topic into
an issue of freedom of speech..

1208
01:38:38,059 --> 01:38:40,721
..and human rights
and take it to the UN.

1209
01:38:40,828 --> 01:38:42,853
But, sir..
- Don't get carried away.

1210
01:38:43,097 --> 01:38:45,327
I'll talk to the
concerned authority.

1211
01:38:45,633 --> 01:38:48,295
We'll take care of the country.
You take care of the border.

1212
01:38:51,739 --> 01:38:53,639
Connect me to Char Chinnar.

1213
01:39:04,385 --> 01:39:07,047
Char Chinnar.
- Gul Jehangir.

1214
01:39:10,825 --> 01:39:12,588
Your life is in danger.

1215
01:39:13,194 --> 01:39:17,096
I know, but the mission
is much more dangerous.

1216
01:39:19,634 --> 01:39:21,226
Leave Kashmir.

1217
01:39:21,969 --> 01:39:23,402
It's the GOC's orders.

1218
01:39:23,871 --> 01:39:27,500
Abort operation '89 now.
- Not possible.

1219
01:39:29,043 --> 01:39:31,807
Jammu is under threat and
we'll have to stop it now.

1220
01:39:32,213 --> 01:39:35,580
Tell GOC that I need
support and not advice.

1221
01:39:37,785 --> 01:39:40,583
And we need to act fast, Major.
- Sir.

1222
01:39:40,855 --> 01:39:42,482
Your suspicion was right.

1223
01:39:42,823 --> 01:39:44,620
Haji is funded by ISI.

1224
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:47,457
This has all the details.

1225
01:39:48,529 --> 01:39:51,259
Give it to your friend.
- Not required.

1226
01:39:51,666 --> 01:39:53,258
She has left PKF.

1227
01:39:53,801 --> 01:39:56,235
She doesn't have
anything to do with Haji.

1228
01:39:57,605 --> 01:39:59,800
For the last 1 7 years Haji has
been depositing this money..

1229
01:39:59,874 --> 01:40:01,808
..in the Maulvi's trust.

1230
01:40:03,277 --> 01:40:05,939
Maybe Aziza doesn't know that.

1231
01:40:08,349 --> 01:40:10,317
Kapoor was right, Major.

1232
01:40:10,418 --> 01:40:13,319
Kashmir is the most
dangerous place in the world.

1233
01:40:13,721 --> 01:40:15,746
Anything's possible here.

1234
01:40:57,264 --> 01:40:59,255
Once again the
Pundit's are the targets here.

1235
01:40:59,467 --> 01:41:02,334
You can imagine what the
Kashmiris will experience.

1236
01:41:02,436 --> 01:41:04,063
What's going to happen?

1237
01:41:04,305 --> 01:41:07,672
There's going to be a
blast in Aatif's rally. - What?

1238
01:41:07,742 --> 01:41:09,539
Ask Aatif to stop the rally.

1239
01:41:09,844 --> 01:41:11,038
But..

1240
01:41:11,112 --> 01:41:13,603
Do as I say. Call Aatif now.

1241
01:41:21,122 --> 01:41:24,922
All lines in this route are busy.
Please call after sometime.

1242
01:41:25,025 --> 01:41:30,520
All lines in this route are busy.
Please call after sometime.

1243
01:41:34,902 --> 01:41:36,733
Today we're about to experience..

1244
01:41:36,837 --> 01:41:38,771
..a historical event in the making.

1245
01:41:38,873 --> 01:41:41,774
Once a militant, now a
political ambassador for peace..

1246
01:41:41,876 --> 01:41:43,935
Aatif Hussain is here to address..

1247
01:41:44,044 --> 01:41:46,274
..the Hindu camps of
the Pundit community.

1248
01:41:46,547 --> 01:41:49,243
The Pundits, who were once
driven away 18 years ago..

1249
01:41:49,316 --> 01:41:51,546
..for the struggle for
freedom by the separatists.

1250
01:41:51,652 --> 01:41:53,347
So why is it that one such leader..

1251
01:41:53,454 --> 01:41:55,786
..is trying to bring
the Hindu community back?

1252
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:59,121
Is it a pure political
gimmick or a genuine reach out?

1253
01:42:36,030 --> 01:42:38,225
Allah is very happy with you, child.

1254
01:42:39,033 --> 01:42:41,058
He has chosen you for 'Jihad'.

1255
01:42:41,469 --> 01:42:43,232
This is the key to your salvation.

1256
01:43:11,031 --> 01:43:13,022
Aatif, cancel this rally.

1257
01:43:13,334 --> 01:43:15,325
There's going to
be a big blast here.

1258
01:43:15,603 --> 01:43:18,037
Thousands of people
will lose their lives.

1259
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:21,403
Look around and see the
number of people present.

1260
01:43:21,675 --> 01:43:25,236
Today is a very important
day in the history of Kashmir.

1261
01:43:25,312 --> 01:43:27,872
And you want me to leave all this.

1262
01:43:28,315 --> 01:43:30,875
This caravan won't stop now.

1263
01:43:35,723 --> 01:43:37,020
This is the stage.

1264
01:43:37,091 --> 01:43:38,115
And these are the four entry points.

1265
01:43:38,225 --> 01:43:39,852
One, two, three, four.

1266
01:43:39,927 --> 01:43:43,454
We'll enter from gate no.3
after the speech starts.

1267
01:43:43,764 --> 01:43:45,857
Javed will take care of the rest.

1268
01:43:46,033 --> 01:43:47,432
As soon as the
mission is completed..

1269
01:43:47,501 --> 01:43:50,368
..you'll meet Media and
you'll meet the captain.

1270
01:43:50,638 --> 01:43:51,764
The success of this operation..

1271
01:43:51,872 --> 01:43:53,737
..is the main motive of our mission.

1272
01:43:53,841 --> 01:43:55,570
There shouldn't be any blunders.

1273
01:43:56,076 --> 01:43:57,168
That's Budd Shah's orders.

1274
01:43:57,278 --> 01:44:00,839
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

1275
01:44:00,915 --> 01:44:05,113
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

1276
01:44:05,219 --> 01:44:09,315
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

1277
01:44:09,423 --> 01:44:13,484
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

1278
01:44:13,594 --> 01:44:16,028
Long live..
- Aatif Hussain !

1279
01:44:16,096 --> 01:44:21,830
Today I..
- Long live.. - Aatif Hussain !

1280
01:44:29,443 --> 01:44:34,608
I'm not here to make
any political promises.

1281
01:44:36,417 --> 01:44:40,080
I'm here to tell you
about my heartfelt desire.

1282
01:44:41,822 --> 01:44:46,225
A desire, which is the
voice of every true Kashmiri.

1283
01:44:47,628 --> 01:44:49,289
There is someone at the window.
- Ok, sir.

1284
01:44:49,563 --> 01:44:53,158
All of you.. come back.

1285
01:44:56,236 --> 01:44:58,033
Come back.

1286
01:45:05,179 --> 01:45:07,875
We can't forget the past.

1287
01:45:07,982 --> 01:45:13,215
But believe me,
we've all endured pain.

1288
01:45:13,988 --> 01:45:15,182
The only difference is..

1289
01:45:15,255 --> 01:45:18,850
..the militants terrorized you,
the military terrorized us.

1290
01:45:31,138 --> 01:45:33,902
You're living in
these refugee camps..

1291
01:45:34,008 --> 01:45:36,067
..leaving your grand manors behind.

1292
01:45:36,143 --> 01:45:38,941
And we're living
in a beautiful jail.

1293
01:45:39,046 --> 01:45:42,277
Everyone together has
turned Kashmir into a company..

1294
01:45:42,349 --> 01:45:43,873
..for their own benefit.

1295
01:45:43,951 --> 01:45:47,284
And only the common
Kashmiris are at loss.

1296
01:45:47,354 --> 01:45:50,881
Whether he's Hindu or Muslim.

1297
01:45:58,332 --> 01:46:00,766
We had very minor
disputes amongst ourselves.

1298
01:46:01,168 --> 01:46:03,363
And they did their duty
to add fuel to the fire.

1299
01:46:03,437 --> 01:46:06,201
Because their benefit
was in separating us.

1300
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:08,908
But it is our duty to
solve these problems..

1301
01:46:09,009 --> 01:46:14,276
..and reunite again, and it
is also our responsibility.

1302
01:46:22,122 --> 01:46:24,886
And if we don't take this step..

1303
01:46:26,627 --> 01:46:30,620
..then Jammu will face
the same consequences..

1304
01:46:30,998 --> 01:46:33,193
..as Kashmir has been,
for the last 18 years.

1305
01:48:59,479 --> 01:49:03,575
Haji Sayyed Shah.. is
the murderer of my father..

1306
01:49:04,651 --> 01:49:08,212
..Maulvi Abbas Ansari.

1307
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,227
For the last 18 years..

1308
01:49:15,295 --> 01:49:18,059
..he's been toying around
with the reputation of Kashmir.

1309
01:49:20,801 --> 01:49:22,996
Do you know what
you're saying, Aziza?

1310
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:24,999
I have evidence.

1311
01:49:25,772 --> 01:49:28,070
His bank records, which show..

1312
01:49:28,175 --> 01:49:30,643
..crores of rupees being transferred
to his account for years.

1313
01:49:32,579 --> 01:49:36,913
ISI and many other agencies
have been funding him for years.

1314
01:49:37,284 --> 01:49:39,445
So that Kashmir
keeps getting destroyed.

1315
01:49:39,887 --> 01:49:43,118
So that they can keep
misleading Kashmiris..

1316
01:49:43,523 --> 01:49:46,492
..under the pretext of Islam,
or in the name of 'Jihad'.

1317
01:49:46,727 --> 01:49:48,024
Or under the pretext
of Kashmir's honour..

1318
01:49:48,095 --> 01:49:50,325
..or the freedom struggle.

1319
01:49:51,031 --> 01:49:55,661
Haji Sayyed Shah's job is to
toy around with our feelings!

1320
01:50:02,142 --> 01:50:05,043
And he's very keen to
tearing his passport, isn't he?

1321
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:07,509
He has passports of three countries.

1322
01:50:07,614 --> 01:50:10,674
India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

1323
01:50:11,418 --> 01:50:14,819
Haji Sayyed Shah has done
what the government of India..

1324
01:50:15,088 --> 01:50:19,047
..and Pakistan has been
doing with us for so many years.

1325
01:50:21,662 --> 01:50:24,062
Haji is a culprit of every mother..

1326
01:50:24,131 --> 01:50:26,099
..who has lost his son.

1327
01:50:26,433 --> 01:50:30,927
He's the culprit of every
son who has lost his father.

1328
01:50:31,505 --> 01:50:34,167
And he's the
culprit of every woman..

1329
01:50:34,374 --> 01:50:37,070
..whose husband is missing.

1330
01:50:37,744 --> 01:50:40,304
This is not my personal war.

1331
01:50:40,380 --> 01:50:43,975
Instead, it has become the
issue of Kashmir's existence.

1332
01:50:44,584 --> 01:50:48,645
Haji Sayyed Shah has
deceived the people of Kashmir.

1333
01:50:49,156 --> 01:50:51,124
He has deceived you.

1334
01:50:51,558 --> 01:50:54,356
And it's your right to punish him.

1335
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:30,423
PKF's leader Haji sayyed shah
was arrested from Srinagar today.

1336
01:51:30,497 --> 01:51:32,522
An intense exchange of
fire has been going on..

1337
01:51:32,632 --> 01:51:34,122
..between the army and Lashkar.

1338
01:51:34,234 --> 01:51:37,294
According to sources Budd
Shah was killed in an encounter.

1339
01:51:37,371 --> 01:51:40,499
Firing between armed
forces and terrorists continue..

1340
01:51:40,574 --> 01:51:42,735
Two terrorists have been killed.

1341
01:51:42,843 --> 01:51:47,906
160 died in serial blasts
in four places in India.

1342
01:51:47,981 --> 01:51:50,779
Terror strikes Mumbai again..

1343
01:51:50,884 --> 01:51:54,251
Haji Sayyed Shah has been
released on health grounds.

1344
01:51:54,788 --> 01:51:56,517
In the name of Islam..

1345
01:51:56,590 --> 01:51:58,285
In the name of Pundits..

1346
01:51:58,358 --> 01:52:00,292
In the name of Kashmir's honour..

1347
01:52:00,327 --> 01:52:02,022
In the name of Freedom..

1348
01:52:02,095 --> 01:52:06,896
Everyone is involved.
