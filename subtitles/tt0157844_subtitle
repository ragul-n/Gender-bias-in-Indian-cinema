1
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,644
Lord, this royal treasure...

2
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,242
is for the welfare and well-being
of the people

3
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:30,180
Neither my forefathers nor l have
ever taken anything from it

4
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,493
After the heart-attack,
l want to entrust...

5
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,790
the responsibility of the safety
of the treasure to the Prince

6
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,300
Bless him, Lord, so that he turns
out to be a kind-hearted king...

7
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:50,675
who rules the hearts of the people
Bless him with wisdom and strength, Lord

8
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,247
Shamshera, I’m proud
of your loyalty

9
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,018
l entrust the safety of
the royal treasure to you

10
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,423
Go

11
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,879
See that bird, Lakhan?

12
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:33,880
lt's the falcon, Bahadur Shamsher.
lt's terribly dangerous

13
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,223
That place it guards...

14
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:46,489
is where the whole treasure
of Anjangarh lies buried

15
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,500
l know that, but how
does one get there?

16
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:58,039
l know. How about my share?

17
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,080
You'll get half of it

18
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:08,079
The King wears a pendant.
ln the pendant...

19
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,753
is a map that leads
to the royal treasure

20
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,095
Put this away safely

21
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,557
The way to the royal treasure
is on this very map

22
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,615
Nobody except you
knows of this secret

23
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,222
Till such time as
the Prince grows up...

24
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,518
he must not get to know either.
- As you wish, Maharaja

25
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,636
I’ve put the map in this. lt'll
remain around the prince's neck

26
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:33,168
Maharaja, your soldiers and guards
are in my custody

27
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,507
l don't want unnecessary bloodshed

28
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,672
Just hand me the pendant which has
the map of the royal treasure

29
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,982
Pendant? Which pendant?

30
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:50,256
That pendant which has the map
leading to the royal treasure

31
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,751
So this is your doing, is it?
- Yes

32
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,121
You wouldn't give me 5000 rupees
when l asked for it

33
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,800
He's now going to make me
the owner of 50 million!

34
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,165
Maharaja Shoor Veer Singh...

35
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:08,100
quietly take off the pendant
and give it to Lakhan

36
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,809
You know the consequences of
betraying the royal family

37
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:17,809
You can expect loyalty only
from a dog nowadays, Maharaja

38
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,721
And your brother is
a mere human being...

39
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,521
who can sell out to anyone
for a handful of money

40
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,860
Take care of this pendant, prince.
- ls father going to remain here?

41
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,993
No, we'll see you very soon

42
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,895
Chetak, take this letter to the S.P.
and carry the prince to safety

43
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,139
Go on!
- Let's go, Chetak

44
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:46,836
Father, what am l to wear?
- You...? Wear these clothes

45
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,676
Maharaja! Are you giving me
the pendant, or must l open fire?

46
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,885
Let me do this noble task, Lakhan

47
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,452
Hold it! You want the pendant
the Maharaja is wearing, isn't it?

48
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,889
No, Mangal Singh! No...
- Have patience, Maharaja

49
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,894
You are the most cherished treasure
your people have

50
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:09,059
A thousand such treasures could be
sacrificed to save your life

51
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,795
Please go and take rest

52
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,939
Here you are, Lakhan.
- ls it the same one?

53
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,941
Yes, it's the same pendant, Lakhan!
Let's go!

54
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:27,952
Wait... let me see that map first.
- No, Lakhan. Don't make that mistake

55
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,950
Break it anyway you wish and you
could tear a part of the map

56
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,355
Better take it to a goldsmith
and have it opened carefully

57
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:40,296
Mangal Singh, you will surely have
your reward when we find the treasure

58
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,960
I’ll give the ingrate
his reward right now!

59
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,531
Hold it!

60
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,844
Finish him, Lakhan!
And kill the prince too

61
00:06:55,081 --> 00:07:01,020
And rear my son Ranjit
like your own son

62
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,121
You are the one who has
started the bloodshed

63
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,352
You have killed my friend!
I’m not sparing you now...

64
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,122
No, Lakhan. Don't kill Maharaja.
Take my life instead

65
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,368
No, I’m not accepting
your sacrifice Mangal Singh

66
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,038
l want to make you my companion!
Out of my way...

67
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,438
Chief, look whom I’ve brought

68
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,476
Father...

69
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,349
Mangal, l don't want
to give you any sorrow

70
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,586
Your king will live.
- Really?

71
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:43,355
But your king has committed a murder

72
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,089
And l want revenge for the killing

73
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,900
Very well, Lakhan. I’m ready.
- No, no!

74
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,139
The prince will die instead
of the Maharaja

75
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:04,346
So that the grief of his son makes
the Maharaj suffer all his life

76
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,144
Don't kill that child!
He's not the prince

77
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,487
You are lying, Maharaja.
- I’m speaking the truth

78
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,156
That's Mangal Singh's son.
- Really?

79
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:23,168
Mangal Singh, is he your son?
Speak! ls he your son?

80
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:30,165
No. Every father speaks a lie
to save his son's life

81
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,209
He's the real prince, Lakhan Singh

82
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:41,352
Zorawar, ax the prince with
your swords and throw him out

83
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,620
Father! Help!

84
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,088
Father! Help!

85
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,626
Mangal Singh, why're you doing this?
Tell them that he's your son

86
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,234
Father! Help!

87
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:31,029
Shame on your manliness!
Why are you using a whip?

88
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,167
Use swords. Even then you will not
find the real pendant!

89
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,136
Where is the map?
- My mouth will never open...

90
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,709
to tell you about the
royal treasure, Lakhan!

91
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,345
I’ll cut your tongue to pieces!

92
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,145
Hurry up and see the power
of loyalty for yourself

93
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:53,518
Make two pieces of my tongue
and it'll resound with ''No''

94
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,763
Make four pieces and the voice
will reverberate four times more

95
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,367
Silence!
- You can silence me...

96
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:06,401
but the prince is not going
to remain silent, Lakhan.

97
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,674
The prince?
- Yes

98
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:15,670
The one you killed with your swords,
was not the prince.

99
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,417
Who was he...? Who?

100
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,985
Who was he?
- He was my son.

101
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,754
Your son? You're lying!

102
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:37,435
Mangal never tells a lie.
You take the truth for a lie

103
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,137
The prince is very much alive...

104
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,098
and he wears the real pendant
around his neck!

105
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,134
No!
- Yes

106
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:50,145
So listen... l will move
heaven and earth...

107
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:55,983
and find the real prince!
- Like hell you will

108
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,917
Come the time, the prince
will himself find you...

109
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,086
and avenge his father's death!

110
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:07,022
That day, your chest will stand up
to the prince's bullets Lakhan!

111
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,526
The prince's bullets?
- Yes

112
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:14,496
l will clap every time
the bullets hit you

113
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,542
You will clap?
- Yes. And loudly too!

114
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,547
Let me see how you clap

115
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,558
This palace is abandoned, Mangal

116
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,693
You and the prince
will now live with me

117
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:44,095
No, S.P. Till the prince grows up,
l must live here

118
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,604
And you are now responsible
for the prince's well being anyway

119
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,602
Why not? The Maharaja's
wish shall be fulfilled

120
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,115
The prince will indeed
marry my daughter, Seema

121
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,483
Where is the prince?
- What are you talking about?

122
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,011
Didn't the prince come to you?
- To us?

123
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,883
Yes. l personally sent
him away astride Chetak

124
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,422
But he didn't get to us.
- No?

125
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,421
So where has the prince gone?

126
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:15,289
No! Such an injustice
can never be possible!

127
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,637
That garland is meant for God!

128
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,342
How did this lovely child
land here?

129
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,816
There's no one around either

130
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:48,192
My son... do not be afraid.
Nothing will happen to you

131
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:55,301
Who are you? How did you get here?
Where are your parents?

132
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,544
Don't cry... I’m here with you, son.
I’m here

133
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,148
What have you done...?

134
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,250
Don't worry, Guru.
Nothing's going to happen

135
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,922
I’ve been brought up in the
company of snake-charmers

136
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,158
Nothing's going to happen to me.
l have a lot of scars on my body

137
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,857
This is just another.
- What scars?

138
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,964
Not snake-bites. They're scars
of sword-injuries

139
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,162
Sword-injuries?
- Want to see?

140
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,433
See

141
00:16:55,914 --> 00:17:00,578
This is what my story is all about...
my introduction. Good bye

142
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,551
Listen... come here

143
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:12,225
You have saved my life.
This loot now belongs to you

144
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,028
l appreciate your strength.
But l don't accept charity

145
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,234
I’m happily giving it away...
you have saved my life

146
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:30,239
To save a life is man's duty.
And l don't sell my duties

147
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:35,278
l consider all those who stake
their lives to save another...

148
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:40,657
to be my friends. And I’m not going
to let you return empty-handed, friend

149
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,891
Friend...? ln that case,
we split the stuff two ways

150
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:51,162
Half for you and half for me.
- All right

151
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:01,880
No fifty-fifty. lt's going to
be split in three parts

152
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,889
Take that. Shoot your mouth off...

153
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,528
and I’ll split you and your horse
into two pieces. Get going

154
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,897
Bravo!

155
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,809
No. You guys can't open that chest

156
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,416
Only my hands have the magic
to open it

157
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,277
However...

158
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,086
Get lost. One blow, and you'll
regret how you look

159
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,987
God has taken care of that already.
Get on with it

160
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,790
He talks too much.

161
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,026
l have some explosives.
What's this box...

162
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,771
it could even blow up a bank vault.
I’ll go and get it

163
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,480
Scram!

164
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,491
They have the explosives,
but they don't have a match

165
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,990
lt isn't for novices
to open that lock

166
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,426
Only l can open it.
However...

167
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,574
Skip the introductions.
Let's see what you can do

168
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:36,430
lf he still can't open it, I’ll give
him a thrashing he won't ever forget

169
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,300
Open Sesame!

170
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,344
God Almighty! So much of it!

171
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,018
Ganeshpur's treasure is
no smaller than the Nizam's!

172
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,459
l don't want much...
l just want a sports car

173
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,352
You guys can take
the whole thing away!

174
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,140
Danny, can you shut the vault
like you opened it?

175
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,743
Once l lock it, even the master-key
won't be able to open it

176
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,285
Ranjit, my son...

177
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,851
I’m now convinced, you are going to
multiply my wealth and riches

178
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,427
Your son... he'll emulate you,
even if it is a little

179
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,604
Wait and watch, dad. I’ll one day lay
at your feet the treasure of Anjangarh

180
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,606
The one you haven't been
to trace, to this day

181
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:10,828
Even the master-key won't unlock it.
- Looks like it's rusted

182
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:16,493
Your brains are rusted, Sujit.
- Never mind, dad

183
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,830
I’ve made all arrangements

184
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:27,537
Had the cops not followed us,
we'd have brought it right here...

185
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,608
and not buried it elsewhere.
Going by what our informer says...

186
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:36,549
this vault contains riches
worth at least 5 million

187
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,429
All yours, dad.
- Hold it!

188
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,563
Before we behold the Goddess,
mustn't we perform the ritual?

189
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,432
I’ve washed it in the holy waters!

190
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,092
What's that?

191
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:10,614
''We're large-hearted:
we're incomparable''

192
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,414
''Where else will you find
guys like us?''

193
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:22,422
''We're large-hearted
and we're incomparable''

194
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,096
''Where else will you find
guys like us?''

195
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,827
''We're scared of no one''

196
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,500
''We ride as fast as the winds''

197
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:17,203
''We're not mere friends,
we're brothers...''

198
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,450
''we're the good Samaritans''

199
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,586
''ln every lane,
they talk about us...''

200
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:29,088
''that there is no one
quite like us''

201
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:37,224
''We're large-hearted
and incomparable''

202
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,938
''Where else will you find
guys like us?''

203
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,947
''There are those who
plunder the poor...''

204
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:58,146
''we rob those thieves''

205
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,887
''We're friends of those
who are human...''

206
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:10,300
''to the devils, we're enemies''

207
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,003
''They watched in amazement
and wondered...''

208
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,739
''there's no one
quite like us''

209
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:25,813
''We're large-hearted
and incomparable''

210
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:29,749
''Where else will you find
guys like us?''

211
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:06,217
''ln our hearts,
we bear grief...''

212
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,426
''but we bear happy tidings
from Spring''

213
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:22,195
''Every ruin we must restore''

214
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,536
''Those who see us say...''

215
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:30,437
''there's no one quite like us''

216
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:38,478
''We're large-hearted
and incomparable''

217
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,485
''Where else will you find
guys like us?''

218
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,605
l'm so hungry,
l can't go to sleep

219
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,079
No biscuits either

220
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,283
They've finished everything

221
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,154
l will not spare them.

222
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,188
They're fast asleep
after a hearty meal

223
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,892
And l'm starving

224
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,349
How come?

225
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,091
Roast!

226
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:27,991
Roasted chicken!

227
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:41,172
Wait... you won't have any trouble

228
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,449
ln just a slash,
l'll cut your throat

229
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,152
You too? C'mon

230
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,750
Once l eat her up,
l'll eat you too

231
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,934
What are you doing?
- He was knifing my neck!

232
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,934
No, l swear it!

233
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:14,645
He wanted to make off with the dough.
- No, not you...

234
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,545
l was cutting the chicken's throat
- A chicken?

235
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:23,382
Yes, l was so hungry, l thought you
guys were chickens... white and red

236
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,821
Forgive me, but it was
your turn after his

237
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,828
Hey! l'm hungry too

238
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:37,560
More or less...
- l'm dying!

239
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:42,706
Wait, l'll make some arrangement.
- Arrangement? ls there food somewhere?

240
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,242
Look over there

241
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,682
Anybody in?

242
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,759
Raise your hands.
Else, l'll blow your brains out

243
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,560
Blown away already.
But not my brains... my heart

244
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,002
Who are you?
And what brings you here?

245
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,765
The treasure of your beauty
draws me here, lovely one

246
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,632
Skip the rubbish!
Bloody thief! Scoundrel!

247
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,444
Wow! You do recognise people.
Don't you, beautiful one?

248
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,407
Thievery and hold ups...

249
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,549
l must have it made in your
world of crime too. What say?

250
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:07,554
l'll see it's made for you right now.
You perhaps don't know...

251
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:12,687
we're here hunting.
Geeta, fetch a rope from inside.

252
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,594
Right away.
- What do you need a rope for?

253
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,036
lf you must bind me... hold me
in your arms and kill me

254
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,039
Speak another word and
l'll shoot you

255
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:26,737
Your mouth is anyway
shooting away

256
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,343
Put your clothes in order
or l'm anyway a dead man

257
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,660
Bahadur!

258
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,098
That was the memsaheb!

259
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,801
Bahadur, shoot at him! Go on!

260
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,904
ln a moment, memsaheb...
l'm really going to shoot!

261
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,281
Why don't you shoot?

262
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,486
How will l, memsaheb?
This one is not loaded

263
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,485
The Government won't
give me any bullets

264
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,826
But this one sure is loaded

265
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,458
l...

266
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,498
Geeta, what happens now?
- Seema might get raped

267
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,500
Nothing's going to happen

268
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,503
He looks more of a hero to me,
not a villain

269
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,778
ln a situation like this one,
it isn't rape...

270
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,208
chances are that a romance
will blossom

271
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:43,549
Now do as l say.
Open up...

272
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,817
the lunch-box.
Go on

273
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,393
and fill this one with food

274
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,225
Hurry up

275
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,396
Don't give it all away!
- What will we eat?

276
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:05,841
Put that one... and the fruits too

277
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,479
Also the chicken.
We love it!

278
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,645
Now pick up the lunch box
and see me off outside

279
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,954
Hey! That's a kidnapping!

280
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,021
Really?

281
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,021
Shall we go?

282
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,286
Shall we?

283
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,269
Bananas for me!

284
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,844
So much of money!
- This one's full too

285
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,356
Dr Bakshi, all the donation boxes
are filled with money again

286
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,952
There's also a note. Look

287
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:10,200
''Doctor, your hard work
and selfless service......''

288
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:16,207
''has turned this small nursing home
into Asia's top, modern hospital''

289
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,413
''This money is for the new
lntensive Care Unit''

290
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,415
''Keep expanding the hospital. There
will never be a dearth of money''

291
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,822
He must be an angel.
- You're right

292
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,084
Know what, sister?

293
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,430
Whenever l receive funds for the
hospital from such anonymous sources...

294
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,232
l'm reminded of that young man...

295
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,837
Doctor, my mother will recover.
Won't she?

296
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,208
Please, doctor!
Save my mother! Save her!

297
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:53,449
Nurse, take her to operation theatre
and have the oxygen cylinders ready

298
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,752
Hurry up.
- We have only one cylinder, doctor

299
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,148
And we're using that on the patient
who met with an accident

300
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,229
Doctor, tell me where we can find
a cylinder. l'll go and bring it

301
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,928
This is Dr Bakshi

302
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:15,504
lmmediately send me an oxygen cylinder
and two bottles of blood of ''O'' group

303
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,767
What? There's no blood?

304
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:25,212
Okay, send the cylinder to me. l'll
try another hospital for the blood

305
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,750
Doctor, the patient's pulse
is sinking

306
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,951
Maa...

307
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,955
Maa!

308
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:50,897
Shankar, if only we had blood and an
oxygen cylinder at the hospital...

309
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,234
l might have been able to
save your mother

310
00:36:55,746 --> 00:37:00,274
But what can l do?
lt isn't just your mother...

311
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:05,622
there are so many patients who die
for want of proper treatment

312
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:10,126
And they'll continue to die.
- No!

313
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,629
l swear it on you, Maa...

314
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,042
l take an oath...

315
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:31,238
no mother will ever die for want
of proper treatment again. Never!

316
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,581
Daddy! Brother!

317
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,694
Daddy, l know what
you're thinking about

318
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:55,072
Also you, brother...
l know what you're thinking.

319
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:01,511
Asha, what do you want to say?
- Daddy, you're wondering...

320
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,346
why l've worn this
dress today, right?

321
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,147
You're playing the ''Girl Who Wields
the Whip'' in the college play?

322
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,120
Asha's obsessed with
horse-riding nowadays

323
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,888
Brother got it absolutely right.
- Why horse-riding?

324
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,163
Why must you take the risk?
- You're simply scared, daddy

325
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,098
Nothing's going to happen to me.
Besides, l have an expert trainer

326
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,935
Dad, l must leave too.
l've got to meet someone.

327
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,808
Wait Ranjit...
Come back soon, dear

328
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:48,154
How often have l told you not to say
such things in your sister's presence?

329
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,019
Asha must never get to know anything
about our double-lives

330
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:53,746
''You are a thief...
you steal hearts''

331
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:57,625
''But you're the one who robs me
of my sleep and peace...''

332
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,963
''that's entirely your doing''

333
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:07,970
''You are a thief...
you steal hearts''

334
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,002
''But you're the one who robs me
of my sleep and peace...''

335
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,345
''that's entirely your doing''

336
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,114
''You are a thief...
you steal hearts''

337
00:40:54,752 --> 00:41:01,089
''Slowly, quietly,
and oh so stealthily...''

338
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:07,923
''you cast a spell on my heart
with your beguiling glance''

339
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:15,094
''God Almighty!
That's an accusation against me''

340
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:21,445
''You are a thief...
you steal hearts''

341
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:26,614
''But you're the one who robs me
of my sleep and peace...''

342
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,784
''that's entirely your doing''

343
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:36,558
''You are a thief...
you steal hearts''

344
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:23,099
''Your eyes, your chatter,
your lovely tresses...''

345
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:30,276
''who is it who won't go mad
in love with you?''

346
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,616
''Love itself is madness...''

347
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,276
''my beauty is
but an excuse'

348
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:44,617
''You are a thief...
you steal hearts''

349
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:48,692
''But you're the one who robs me
of my sleep and peace...''

350
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,966
''that's entirely your doing''

351
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:58,899
''You are a thief...
you steal hearts''

352
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:27,026
''lt's difficult to say who took
the first step, who was aggressive''

353
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:34,009
''Rather we keep quiet
than say anything''

354
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:41,409
''Silence, rather than words...
is the word to utter''

355
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:48,748
''You are a thief...
you steal hearts''

356
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,951
''But you're the one who robs me
of my sleep and peace...''

357
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,891
''that's entirely your doing''

358
00:43:56,367 --> 00:44:02,897
''You are a thief...
you steal hearts''

359
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:03,752
Jump

360
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:28,082
ln an accident like this one,
you could've lost both your eyes

361
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:31,752
Thank God your
blood groups matched

362
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:36,755
AB Rh-negative is difficult to
come by, even in hospitals

363
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:44,798
You have saved my life.
How will l repay this debt, my son?

364
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,808
You have repaid my debt.
- How come?

365
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:02,817
You called me your son...
nobody has ever called me a son

366
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:07,414
Why not? Your parents...?

367
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:15,157
l don't know who they are.
l was still a child...

368
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:21,368
when the gypsies found me.
l was brought up by them

369
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,538
ls there no way you can be
identified then?

370
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,240
He carries his identification marks
on his back

371
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:31,377
On his back?
- You folks are still here?

372
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,882
Please leave. He needs to rest

373
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:38,884
We must leave now, uncle.
- Listen...

374
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,551
l haven't asked the two of you
anything about yourselves

375
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,895
l'm Asha. And he's Sanga

376
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,297
The two of us...

377
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:52,492
l understand

378
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,904
Why don't you get married?
- How can we?

379
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:01,810
l don't have any parents and
l'm scared to talk to her father

380
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,941
Let me get well.
l'll have a word with Asha's father

381
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,511
ln which case, you must stand in for
my father to bless us at our wedding

382
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,958
May God always keep
the two of you happy

383
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,955
We'll drop by again this evening
to see you

384
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,162
Bless you

385
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,630
Asha, my child...
Are you okay?

386
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,876
Yes, daddy.
- You're not hurt, are you?

387
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:36,605
No, brother. Nothing serious.
- Thank God

388
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,015
Daddy, this is Sanga

389
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:52,726
l see. So this is your
expert horse-trainer

390
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,428
No. l was driving my car

391
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,027
There was a gorge ahead
and her life was in danger

392
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,437
So how did you escape?

393
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,469
Daddy, come and meet the man
who saved your daughter's life

394
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:06,538
Sure, let's go

395
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,916
Uncle, my daddy and brother
are here to meet you

396
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,087
Greetings

397
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,715
Please sit down

398
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:34,766
Daddy, had he not risked his life
to save mine...

399
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:39,904
you wouldn't have seen me alive today.
- l can never repay this debt...

400
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,641
but if you could give me
a chance to serve you,...

401
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,814
l'll consider myself fortunate.
- This voice...?

402
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,620
With your permission, l'd like to
take him to my house, doctor

403
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,424
His treatment will lack nothing.
- lt's 'his' voice!

404
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:01,157
Lakhan! Leave me alone...
- What are you doing?

405
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:05,167
He's my biggest enemy...
l'm going to kill him!

406
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:11,166
What are you doing?
- l.G... this is Lakhan Singh!

407
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,609
What are you talking about?
- l recognise his voice

408
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:19,214
lt's the bandit's voice!
lt's Lakhan Singh, the murderer!

409
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,017
Let me go... leave me alone!

410
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,220
There's a limit to your illusions

411
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,548
This is not Lakhan Singh.
He's Thakur Surya Pratap Singh

412
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,625
Thakur... ? No!
- lt's true

413
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:35,230
He's a leading industrialist
of the city

414
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,894
Yes, Uncle. The l.G. is
telling you the truth

415
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:45,632
Actually, there has been an incident
in Mangal Singh's life...

416
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,444
something he can never forget.
- What happened?

417
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,280
l have never seen
a better example of loyalty

418
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,946
l never got to hear of a greater
example of sacrifice than his

419
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,450
To save his employer's life...

420
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:07,093
he saw his own son being slaughtered
before his eyes

421
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:10,091
What are you saying?
- Yes

422
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:16,299
That amputated arm happens to be
a part of his great sacrifice

423
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,845
Uncle, your sacrifice will
not go in vain

424
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:30,914
l'm sure, your sacrifice
will one day spew fire...

425
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:35,284
and burn the devil and
his dwellings to ashes

426
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:15,094
Raghu! Heera! Shyam!
Shut all the doors and windows!

427
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:18,090
Everybody stays put...
nobody moves

428
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:25,437
Who threw that there?
- l didn't throw it... it fell there

429
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:31,847
l'm glad you didn't fall into it.
Do you see this electric current...?

430
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:39,478
lt's 440 volts. How many volts?
- Right!

431
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:47,930
Touch it, and you're dead.
- Why have such a strong current?

432
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:51,495
Fantastic question! That crown
is worth 20 million

433
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:54,768
Will we keep that out in the open?
- That's worth 20 million?

434
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:56,835
So what did you think?

435
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:01,669
Know something? Every criminal
in lndia has his eyes on that

436
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:05,274
And my eyes are...
- On the thieves?

437
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:14,253
l told the government and had
all the security arrangements made

438
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:18,822
There are hidden TV cameras
everywhere around

439
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:24,564
From here to the marketplace,
there's a hidden alarm

440
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,965
Till where?
- The marketplace

441
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:33,303
No ordinary marketplace.
The police headquarters at Lal Bazar!

442
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,881
Hear that?
The wireless van has arrived

443
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,612
Raghu, switch off the alarm

444
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:47,418
You bear a great responsibility.
- But naturally

445
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:53,294
l'm the Head Guard around here.
Just as a cobra used to...

446
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:59,294
protect the royal treasures, this
20 million Vijay Mukut (crown)...

447
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:03,369
is being protected by me
in this city

448
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,675
l'm the protector

449
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,910
With this crown, l'll start
a new hospital

450
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,282
With your blessings, Maa...

451
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:22,150
this lifeless crown of 20 million
will save a million lives

452
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,292
Yes, Rini. lt's me

453
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:34,699
Security at the museum is so strong,
that not even a fly can get in

454
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:41,471
The buzz is that the crown
is going to Delhi after four days

455
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:44,245
All right. Meet me at 3 p.m.

456
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:49,444
lnform Django...
- That iron-teethed guy?

457
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,982
Yes, but be careful. Because he's
already dead, as per police records

458
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,416
Bring him through the graveyard

459
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,167
Remember your mummy, son?

460
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,606
She loved you a lot, didn't she?

461
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:16,210
Remember those lovely toys
she used to bring for you?

462
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:22,210
On your birthday last year, she brought
a train like this one for you

463
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:23,211
Remember?

464
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,489
How come you're early today?
- lt's your birthday today...

465
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,484
and everything is falling in place.
On my way home...

466
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,060
there was this gentleman who
gave me a ride till home

467
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:37,425
Or l'd still have been standing
in a queue for the bus

468
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,066
When is daddy returning?

469
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,827
l phoned him from the office,
he must be arriving any moment

470
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:45,333
Go ahead and play
while l go and change

471
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,609
Your friends must be coming too

472
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,141
Montu! Call your daddy

473
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:00,885
His daddy's not at home.
l heard you saying that

474
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,688
Scoundrel! Let me go!

475
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:08,226
Leave my mummy alone!
Let go of her!

476
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,903
Leave my mummy alone!

477
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,264
Let my mummy go!

478
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,475
l'll stab you with the knife...
don't get any closer!

479
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:26,945
l'll use the knife!
- No... you can't kill me

480
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,245
l'll kill myself!

481
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:31,284
Let my mother go!

482
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:45,693
Who came home that day?
Who locked you up in the room?

483
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,094
Who was the bastard
who killed your mummy?

484
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:51,703
The one who caused you
to lose your voice

485
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,509
Speak, Montu...

486
00:56:56,479 --> 00:57:00,609
Just once, tell me something about
the way he dressed or looked

487
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,745
Speak, my son... tell me!

488
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,515
Why don't you speak?

489
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:14,293
Darling, forgive me

490
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,429
l've been angry with your Montu

491
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:20,969
You know...

492
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,299
ever since you've left...

493
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:26,808
Montu has lost his voice

494
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:32,046
To restore his speech,
l've done everything l could

495
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,081
But it looks as if
it's all of no use

496
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:41,089
l can't take it anymore

497
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:45,418
l'm going to go mad...
l'm going mad!

498
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:20,162
Once Montu tells me
about the killer...

499
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,890
l won't let him live

500
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,029
l swear it on you...
l'll kill him

501
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:31,669
Mary, take Montu home.
Go on, Montu

502
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,478
Get up, Danny

503
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:40,211
You must've got at least some
clue about the killer

504
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:45,818
Only a cigarette-butt.
Look

505
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:56,020
Whoever he is, he's not just
your enemy... he's our enemy too.

506
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:08,439
Django...

507
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,037
you're alive, despite being
dead in the records

508
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:15,942
Remember, you can't betray
death all the time

509
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:19,547
Mr Ranjit, the name is Django D'costa

510
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:24,793
lf a cat has nine lives,
l have many more

511
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,693
Because l carry death in my mouth

512
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:49,751
''Django, the dreaded jewel-thief,
has died in a car-accident''

513
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:31,618
Father, l just saw a
man in the graveyard,...

514
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,595
who is supposed to have died
a year ago

515
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:39,432
And l saw him wearing that hat...
- This is my hat, my son

516
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:42,427
lt was l who kept it here
Besides...

517
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:45,607
no one ever returns from
the heavens, my boy

518
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:52,114
But he was the same man, father
Once l set my eyes on someone...

519
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:56,581
the picture remains imprinted
on my mind forever

520
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,760
You are imagining things.
- No, father

521
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:12,997
A picture of this man was published
on Page 3 of the ''lndian Express''...

522
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:17,963
on the 6th of December 1982,
with a news story

523
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:23,974
''The dreaded jewel-thief,
has died in a car-accident''

524
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:27,548
What was his name...?
Django!

525
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:38,560
One has to pay for
his misdeeds, my son

526
01:01:57,146 --> 01:02:01,048
This is Django's widow.
The poor woman comes here often...

527
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:04,949
to pray for her husband's soul

528
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,864
Come...
- Believe it or not...

529
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:20,033
it was Django himself.
My memory can never let me down

530
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:27,970
They've left

531
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:56,302
l've told Django that the crown
is being taken to Delhi in a train

532
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,907
There will also be
a strong security net

533
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:01,540
However strong the security is...

534
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:05,303
that crown will be at your feet
by tomorrow evening

535
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,476
Don't you talk too much, Django

536
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,986
Do you know that you
have been recognised?

537
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:11,749
Me?
- Yes

538
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:14,553
l had a tough time
getting rid of them

539
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,482
At this rate, you can be
caught at any time

540
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,362
And l can't risk 20 million
just like that

541
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:24,425
l'll have to find a special way
of sending you to Delhi

542
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:38,812
Dad, the train carrying the crown
has just left Gate No. 10

543
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:51,658
Friends, l am thankful to the
organisers of this inter-collegiate...

544
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:58,662
cultural competition, for having
bestowed on me the honour...

545
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:03,829
of being the Chief Guest here today.
l am also happy to know...

546
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:10,846
that the prize
the winning team here gets...

547
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:15,349
is sponsored by Thakur saheb

548
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:20,884
And that is the Crown of the Year

549
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:28,897
Sir, the Crown has been robbed.
- From a running train?

550
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:32,233
lt's true, sir

551
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,905
l'm sorry, l can't stay any longer.
- But you're the chief guest!

552
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:39,901
Please stand in for me

553
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:00,391
Brother, is the l.G. leaving?

554
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:03,594
What's up, uncle? You're leaving
before the function is over?

555
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:07,127
Yes, l have some important work.
- So who will crown the winner?

556
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,404
lt's your daddy's prerogative now

557
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:22,707
What? The man who jumped
in the waters with the crown...

558
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,018
was wearing an orange coloured
boiler suit?

559
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,155
Ask Headquarters to inform
radio and television

560
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:36,021
And block all entry and exit points
of the city

561
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:42,266
And listen, do not let anyone go
without a search. l'm coming over

562
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,040
There's only one way out now

563
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:52,447
l must swap this crown with
the one in the competition...

564
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:56,079
and deal with the winner later

565
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:06,884
Friends, while we say good-bye to
the old year and welcome the new one...

566
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:11,757
the contest we are about to
present before you...

567
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:14,159
revolves around the theme
''The Old and the New''

568
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:56,438
''lt's truly said...''

569
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:03,475
''lt's truly said by the people
in the world...''

570
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:13,220
''that something new is always new
and what is old is old''

571
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:26,774
''lt's an age-old saying...''

572
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:31,779
''so think of something new
and tell me''

573
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:34,543
''Or tell me...''

574
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:41,283
''Or tell me that you concede...''

575
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:50,726
''what is new is new
and what is old is gold''

576
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:24,024
''The glitter lies in what is new...
what the does the old offer?''

577
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:28,893
''Of what interest is the world
if it were not for the novelty?''

578
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:33,368
''All that glitters
is not gold''

579
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:38,178
''Human feelings are eternal...
new things are but passing fancy''

580
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:45,009
''Don't let...''

581
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:48,082
''don't let the glitter
of playthings dazzle you''

582
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:57,225
''What is new is new...
and old is gold''

583
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,436
Call for you, Thakur saheb

584
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:13,377
Some men gave Django the slip
and made away with the crown

585
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,089
They were in boiler-suits.
The one who jumped into the river...

586
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,756
was wearing an orange-coloured suit

587
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:51,345
''The sign of love...''

588
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:56,215
''is what old images stand for''

589
01:09:56,625 --> 01:10:01,028
''lt's only when you
meet old friends...''

590
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:05,366
''that you speak about it''

591
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,964
''New friends...''

592
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:14,905
''new friends are a joke''

593
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:24,346
''For new is new...
and old is gold''

594
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:56,650
''You're still at the place
you stood ages ago''

595
01:10:57,186 --> 01:11:01,680
''Your times are gone
and you're still here''

596
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:06,360
''What more will l say, love?
You've said it all''

597
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:10,698
''You stand on the ground,
and l fly in the skies''

598
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:15,292
''What's up? Why are
you tongue tied?''

599
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:17,704
''Can't you think...''

600
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:24,703
''can't you think of another
old excuse?''

601
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:33,948
''New is always new...
and old is old''

602
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,320
This crown? Here?

603
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:23,603
10 seconds to go before we ring out
the old and usher in the new year

604
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,641
l will crown her in the darkness...

605
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:31,638
so that there is only the light
of this crown in the darkness

606
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:02,943
Where is your car?

607
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:07,277
Give me the keys.
- What insolence is this?

608
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:14,512
Thanks for the keys.
And give me that crown now

609
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,482
The crown?

610
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,223
You?
- Yes, it's me

611
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:25,132
l took away food the other day. Today,
l'll take Vijay Mukut away too

612
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:29,971
Vijay Mukut?
- lt's what you're wearing

613
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:37,712
Fantastic! Now turn this thug
over to the police!

614
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:53,022
Give me the Vijay Mukut.
l'll hand it over to the police

615
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,423
Suresh, Azad...

616
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,369
this girl has got to know
everything about the Vijay Mukut

617
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:05,038
Take her to the junkyard
at Chandivali and finish her

618
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,239
So you are also...

619
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:14,843
That girl has done nothing...
let her go!

620
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:18,085
Break this guy's hands and legs and
throw him over Tiger Point in a car

621
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,719
Let me go!

622
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,493
Where are you going?

623
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:33,089
Four guys against one...?
Aren't you ashamed?

624
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:37,098
Wait here, my boy...
l'm with you

625
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:51,150
To save that thief,
you're beating us up?

626
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:53,080
Thief?

627
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:02,362
Halt!

628
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:16,704
Let go... let go!

629
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:29,484
Before you embrace death,
let me embrace you once

630
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:34,759
Leave me alone!

631
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,836
Let go!

632
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,907
Leave with the car immediately

633
01:16:57,145 --> 01:17:00,114
Leave!
- How can l leave you in this state?

634
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:03,745
Others in their gang
can get here any moment

635
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,587
Go away immediately!

636
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:21,029
l have misunderstood him

637
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:24,429
lf he was the bad kind, why would
he come here to save me?

638
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:28,042
Why wouldn't he escape with
the crown worth 20 million?

639
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:42,483
What's happening here?
Why have they taken my pictures?

640
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:46,483
To publish them in the newspapers.
Your name will hit the headlines

641
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:52,294
You don't know what a
remarkable thing you have done

642
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:57,095
This crown, the Vijay Mukut, worth
20 million, is national property

643
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:00,107
You have retrieved it from
a band of thieves

644
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:07,173
l must leave this crown in government
care and return to the office

645
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,813
Seema dear... look after him.
- Sure

646
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:19,284
How are you?
- l'm fine, thanks to you

647
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:23,555
By the way, who was that gentleman?
- My daddy

648
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,563
Will you fetch a glass
of water please?

649
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:37,038
Here you are

650
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:48,083
May l have another glass?
- At once

651
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:11,441
Come on upstairs

652
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:23,553
Put your clothes...
- No tricks. My clothes are all right

653
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:26,086
Move... move!

654
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,698
Get ready now

655
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:42,371
Sir...

656
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:45,745
the food is ready
Will you eat here?

657
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,412
Or will you take it away?

658
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:52,753
l know how your mouth starts watering
at the sight of food

659
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:55,755
You forcibly took away the food
the other day

660
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,484
Not today.
- l'm going to forcibly feed you today

661
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:03,420
What?
- With my own hands

662
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:04,429
Really?

663
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:08,726
Sanga, l'm feeling giddy!
l'm going to fall!

664
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:11,362
Sanga, please stop it!
l'm going to fall!

665
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:16,407
For my sake, Sanga...
please stop it!

666
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:20,609
Do you love me?
- l do

667
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:23,616
Don't you want to marry me?
- l do

668
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,820
So why can't you die with me?
- l feel scared

669
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:31,591
All right. l'll be martyred
all alone then!

670
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:43,831
Tell your father that l won't let
him live in peace after l'm dead

671
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:46,840
Sure, l'll tell him Sanga...
but please don't die

672
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:52,879
My remains will prove it
that our love is sacred!

673
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:54,879
Yes, it's sacred!

674
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:58,385
Our love is immortal!
- Yes, we share immortal love!

675
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,715
But please don't die!

676
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:03,891
All right, l won't die
without you

677
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,895
But l will wait for you underwater

678
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,897
O Sea God... take me in your arms!

679
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,301
Here l come!

680
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,676
He has really drowned!

681
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:27,477
Don't go very deep, Sanga...
l'm coming too!

682
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:43,229
Why did you take the plunge
when you can't swim?

683
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:46,695
You said you'd wait
for me underwater!

684
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:49,196
You can die with me,
but you can't marry me!

685
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:51,632
We'll get married too, Sanga.
Daddy is bound to agree

686
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,634
Your daddy wants to see
my bier leave, not your palanquin!

687
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:59,539
Don't talk rubbish! Daddy has invited
you to my birthday party tomorrow

688
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:02,008
What for? Does he want to
cut me up like a cake?

689
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:07,017
l'm sure daddy will announce
our engagement tomorrow

690
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:11,750
ls that the truth?
- Yes. He even wants your friends over

691
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,685
Shankar and Danny?
- Yes

692
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,359
Nectar from a snake?
- What?

693
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:19,429
You call my daddy a snake?
- Oh no

694
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:23,201
Why would your daddy be a snake?
He's an angel... the Cobra

695
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:27,038
And l've always prayed to the Cobra,
as you know

696
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:31,241
l'll worship your father and the
two of us will seek his blessings

697
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:32,345
Like this!

698
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:38,452
Sanga! l won't spare the man
who dreams of having my daughter!

699
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:47,721
Shankar, the bastard who stole
the crown worth 20 million from us!

700
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:52,691
And Danny, the bastard who recognised
Django at the graveyard!

701
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:05,976
l've invited the trio
to Asha's birthday

702
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:10,350
Here you are

703
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:17,756
This party must be their last

704
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:10,243
''Tonight let's stay awake''

705
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:15,680
''We'll feel sleepy,
but let's stay wake...''

706
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:21,281
''looking into each other's eyes
while we wake''

707
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:27,294
''Tonight, let's stay awake''

708
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:12,773
''l won't let the day dawn''

709
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:18,378
''l won't sleep,
l won't let you sleep''

710
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:35,762
''l'll stop the stars
in their orbits''

711
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:41,433
''Tonight, let's stay awake''

712
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:32,544
''ls this how hearts
are given and taken?''

713
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:38,556
''ls this how you fall in love?''

714
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:55,568
''Let those who stay awake
watch us''

715
01:26:57,745 --> 01:27:01,613
''Tonight, let's stay awake''

716
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:47,685
''Night-stars don't shine
by the day''

717
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:53,089
''Where else do l see
those l see in my dreams?''

718
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:06,545
''So...''

719
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:10,716
''in your lap, l'll sit tonight
and l'll wake through the night''

720
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:17,348
''Tonight let's stay awake''

721
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:23,163
''We'll feel sleepy,
but let's stay wake...''

722
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:28,767
''looking into each other's eyes
while we wake''

723
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:38,508
You sing so well, Mrs Django D'costa
- Who's Django...?

724
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:45,548
You can't hide your eyes,
not from Danny's eyes

725
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:54,619
Who's Django? Where is he?
And who was that padre? Talk

726
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:57,563
Talk

727
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:06,461
Where's Django?

728
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:09,463
Talk. Whatever you know
about Django

729
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:13,632
We don't hurt women.
Tell me, quick

730
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:14,222
Well done! Here's your reward

731
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:18,626
l am pleased with you

732
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:24,796
ln just ten minutes,
a train will run them over

733
01:32:25,306 --> 01:32:28,241
Here's proof.
- Oh no, no

734
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:37,250
lt's for the police to find proof.
Destroying evidence. That's my job

735
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:50,881
Where are they?
- We left them here...

736
01:34:51,052 --> 01:34:53,316
unconscious and trussed up.
- Then where did they go?

737
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:56,556
l told you boss, a train
would run them over

738
01:34:59,093 --> 01:35:01,220
Look... the rope

739
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:07,460
But where are they?
- Did the vultures finish them off?

740
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:11,000
Cut out the nonsense.
lf you can't find them...

741
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:13,570
l'll feed you to the dogs

742
01:35:15,743 --> 01:35:18,405
This pendant...?
- The very one we've been trying...

743
01:35:18,679 --> 01:35:23,412
to find all these years.
- Which means we've got hold...

744
01:35:23,684 --> 01:35:30,954
of the locket containing
the map to the treasure?

745
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:33,716
Not yet

746
01:35:36,464 --> 01:35:41,367
But we must get our hands on it.
- Give me 24 hours

747
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:47,173
l'll deliver this man to you,
dead or alive

748
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:49,437
And l'll take pleasure
in giving him a regal funeral

749
01:35:55,716 --> 01:36:02,554
First, we should nab Lily,
to find out about the padre

750
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:09,560
ls there no other topic apart from
the 7-foot man, Lily and the padre?

751
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:18,270
The padre!
- Do you see Lily's padre everywhere?

752
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:20,867
Sit down.
- l'll make mincemeat of him

753
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:23,601
Just let me get my hands on him
- Your orders...?

754
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:25,369
Minced padre

755
01:36:26,714 --> 01:36:29,547
And a skewered Lily.
- Let me find out...

756
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:35,354
Stop joking, we got to find Lily.
- Then go after her

757
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:39,485
And when you find her, marry her
with the padre's blessings

758
01:36:41,829 --> 01:36:44,161
Sit, l'll bring her back

759
01:36:48,936 --> 01:36:58,971
You might be beautiful, but you ought
to put God's gift to good use

760
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:04,440
Allah be praised!

761
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:08,052
How exotic! What a beauty!

762
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:12,154
Lady, you could push me,
like she pushed my wife

763
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,494
l'll thank you, by God!

764
01:37:14,795 --> 01:37:21,963
The blue Fiat! lt will
certainly lead us to Lily

765
01:37:24,205 --> 01:37:28,141
Every man can't be Lily's padre

766
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:31,636
So every blue Fiat isn't Lily's

767
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:33,308
Right

768
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:40,884
But not every blue Fiat
is numbered MMU 7938

769
01:37:41,956 --> 01:37:44,686
Not every backlight is smashed

770
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:49,489
Not every car sports a silver-coloured
horseshoe beside the number plate

771
01:37:50,464 --> 01:37:53,900
Not every rear windscreen
carries a colourful brake-light

772
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:59,839
l see. lf the car is on the roads...
- lt can't escape our eyes

773
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:01,907
Ms Lily for Mr Shankar

774
01:38:08,415 --> 01:38:09,473
l am Shankar speaking.

775
01:38:11,085 --> 01:38:14,213
l just saw you entering that hotel

776
01:38:14,822 --> 01:38:19,953
l want to tell you about the padre.
He wants to see you guys dead

777
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:24,522
He isn't a padre for real.
- Then who is he?

778
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:29,366
That's just what l want to tell you.
See me outside Victoria Memorial

779
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:32,637
At 3pm.
- Victoria Memorial...?

780
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:37,702
Yes, Django is shadowing me.
l'll wear a burda

781
01:38:47,288 --> 01:38:49,017
She's here

782
01:38:57,598 --> 01:38:59,828
l'll talk to her.
- Boss...

783
01:39:00,634 --> 01:39:02,568
she's there

784
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:09,838
l warned you! lt's a ploy

785
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:15,840
So what? Just what how l undo it

786
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:20,753
Let's take one each

787
01:39:22,289 --> 01:39:26,089
Then we'll draw them here.
lf you see something amiss...

788
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,624
hit and run.
Don't bother about us

789
01:39:34,234 --> 01:39:39,433
Are you Ms Lily?
- Allah! l'm an innocent blossom

790
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:40,805
What...?

791
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:47,278
Are you Ms Lily?
- Allah! l'm an innocent blossom

792
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:48,876
What...?

793
01:39:49,216 --> 01:39:52,151
Let find a place where
we will be alone

794
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:56,212
Are you scared about the man
with the steel teeth?

795
01:39:56,557 --> 01:40:05,932
Allah! l'm beautiful. Even men
with golden teeth are after me

796
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:06,757
What?

797
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:11,165
l don't fancy you. l'm here
to find out about the fake padre

798
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:17,806
l am fortunate to have you here.
First promise me...

799
01:40:18,045 --> 01:40:19,979
you will always stand by me

800
01:40:20,414 --> 01:40:24,851
Yes, l will. First tell me,
what's your quarrel with us?

801
01:40:25,419 --> 01:40:30,083
Quarrel? God forbid!
This is only a face-off...

802
01:40:30,557 --> 01:40:35,256
as between people in love

803
01:40:36,196 --> 01:40:40,792
Love? Who's in love?
- Allah! Curse these men

804
01:40:41,301 --> 01:40:49,504
They call woman a queen of heart!
They crown her

805
01:40:49,977 --> 01:40:55,040
But let a woman talk of romance
and he says, who's in love?

806
01:40:56,350 --> 01:41:00,616
You're getting me wrong!
- Of course l am

807
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:05,492
You are obsessed with someone else.
- Who's this someone else...?

808
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:08,125
What are you saying?
You're Lily, aren't you?

809
01:41:08,362 --> 01:41:13,299
Yes, that was my name till
l lost myself to you. l'm in love

810
01:41:13,767 --> 01:41:16,292
Why else would l come here
in a burqa?

811
01:41:16,804 --> 01:41:20,467
Then take it off.
- Allah! What are you saying?

812
01:41:21,241 --> 01:41:23,903
Doesn't take long for a man
to gets wrong notions

813
01:41:24,411 --> 01:41:27,972
Do not suspect my notions.
Talk about the padre, that bastard

814
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:35,350
Goodness! Why curse someone?

815
01:41:35,856 --> 01:41:37,949
lf you won't have a padre...

816
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:42,355
let's call in a marriage registrar.
- What for...?

817
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:45,891
Our wedding.
- Wedding...?

818
01:41:48,502 --> 01:41:55,101
Let's get married. l'll convert
to a Hindu, for your sake

819
01:41:55,809 --> 01:41:58,107
Who told you l'm willing?

820
01:41:58,512 --> 01:42:03,108
Your heart tells me.
l know, you love me

821
01:42:07,154 --> 01:42:08,348
Absolutely true

822
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:16,929
''What's this maze?''

823
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:35,241
''Of all the cities
l've heard of...''

824
01:42:35,549 --> 01:42:38,643
''Calcutta...
- The city of mazes''

825
01:42:38,952 --> 01:42:42,854
''l've lost my way.
- l'm lost''

826
01:42:43,557 --> 01:42:46,492
''ln my own country,
l feel like an alien here''

827
01:43:29,636 --> 01:43:33,163
''Here's where word and deed
mean exactly opposite''

828
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,799
''Chowringhee is a marketplace,
bereft of colour''

829
01:43:38,345 --> 01:43:41,940
''Look, there's rickshawallah
running like a horse''

830
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:46,614
''Between the holy Ganges and riots...
- Looms the monstrous Howrah bridge''

831
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,712
''You understand anything?''

832
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:51,783
''Of all the cities
l've heard of...''

833
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:55,426
''Calcutta...
- The city of mazes''

834
01:43:55,762 --> 01:43:59,289
''l've lost my way.
- l'm lost''

835
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:03,636
''ln my own country,
l feel like an alien here''

836
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:35,359
''Like Mathura and Kasi,
the land of Krsna...''

837
01:44:35,769 --> 01:44:39,705
''this is land
of Netaji and Tagore''

838
01:44:40,207 --> 01:44:44,109
''Learn how to live together
enjoy life''

839
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:48,307
''Our country is one,
speak whatever language you will''

840
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:50,749
''You understand anything?''

841
01:44:51,151 --> 01:44:53,551
''Of all the cities
l've heard of...''

842
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:57,085
''Calcutta...
- The city of mazes''

843
01:44:57,724 --> 01:45:01,160
''l've lost my way,
l'm lost''

844
01:45:01,695 --> 01:45:05,256
''ln my own country,
l feel like an alien here''

845
01:45:19,446 --> 01:45:23,382
''There's Shyambazar,
but there's no Shyam''

846
01:45:24,017 --> 01:45:27,612
''Nor did l see Radha
in Radhabazar''

847
01:45:27,954 --> 01:45:32,152
''No tiles in Tollygunj,
no sand in Ballygunj''

848
01:45:32,559 --> 01:45:36,495
''But in Kalighat,
is the shrine of goddess Kali''

849
01:45:41,435 --> 01:45:45,371
''Glory to Goddess Kali''

850
01:46:39,493 --> 01:46:43,793
l was away in Delhi, but the rest of
the police force wasn't away in Delhi

851
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:49,268
Why did you run around? Nabbing
criminals is the job of the police

852
01:46:50,871 --> 01:46:51,929
Not your job.

853
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:55,633
The ballistics report
in the Lily murder case

854
01:47:01,348 --> 01:47:03,816
Shot by a revolver
with a silencer

855
01:47:04,851 --> 01:47:08,048
A 32 bore revolver

856
01:47:08,388 --> 01:47:13,758
lt must be the handiwork of the padre
who tired to get us killed

857
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:21,533
Asha, are you all right?
- Yes Daddy

858
01:47:23,703 --> 01:47:27,036
l wonder whether anyone needs
a bail bond. That's why l came

859
01:47:27,874 --> 01:47:32,743
Not at all, Thakur saheb.
lf a contingency arises, l'm here

860
01:47:34,147 --> 01:47:37,480
Any clues about the assassin?
- Not yet

861
01:47:38,151 --> 01:47:41,643
Sir, we have a clue.
This cigarette

862
01:47:42,355 --> 01:47:46,223
The killer rolls his cigarettes
l'm certain

863
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:48,955
Just about anyone
could roll his cigarettes

864
01:47:50,163 --> 01:47:55,100
Had Danny seen him once, by now the
killer would've been in police custody

865
01:47:55,368 --> 01:48:00,499
Yes, Danny has a photographic memory.
- Really...?

866
01:48:03,009 --> 01:48:04,704
Will you please stand up?

867
01:48:06,213 --> 01:48:08,545
Why? What is the matter?

868
01:48:17,691 --> 01:48:22,151
The same features, the same face,
the same height

869
01:48:23,396 --> 01:48:27,833
What do you mean?
- The padre l've been talking about...

870
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:31,168
is just like him!
l mean, a duplicate

871
01:48:32,906 --> 01:48:38,708
Yes, put him in a cassock and a beard,
he'll look like the padre

872
01:48:39,045 --> 01:48:41,639
Danny! You mustn't speak like this

873
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:50,214
None of your fault. Actually,
you are so obsessed with murder...

874
01:48:50,657 --> 01:48:53,592
someday you might think
you yourself are an assassin

875
01:48:55,829 --> 01:49:00,960
And that day, l will have to resign.
- May l take Asha along?

876
01:49:03,303 --> 01:49:06,500
Seema, l'm buying Sunday cinema tickets
for all of us

877
01:49:07,807 --> 01:49:11,402
No Asha. Don't buy a ticket for Shankar.
- Why...?

878
01:49:11,878 --> 01:49:15,245
l forgot to tell you.
Shankar is going to Delhi tomorrow

879
01:49:16,349 --> 01:49:20,649
Delhi...?
- lt's about the crown you saved

880
01:49:21,054 --> 01:49:23,522
The lndian Heritage Committee
is giving you an award

881
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:27,021
And a cash prize of 100,000 Rupees

882
01:49:29,663 --> 01:49:36,296
Here's your air ticket. You're on
flight 1 73. Ten a.m tomorrow

883
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:52,146
Hello Thakur saheb.
Car broke down?

884
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:21,710
lsn't he the one...?
- He's the one

885
01:50:23,817 --> 01:50:25,409
Let's take an autograph

886
01:50:25,685 --> 01:50:27,812
Going to Delhi?
- Yes

887
01:51:06,292 --> 01:51:10,285
Won't you give me an autograph?
What's the matter with you?

888
01:51:11,364 --> 01:51:13,298
Something's wrong with him

889
01:51:13,933 --> 01:51:15,867
Go back to your seats

890
01:51:20,607 --> 01:51:23,303
What happened to him?
- l don't know, he's sweating

891
01:51:25,612 --> 01:51:27,944
ls there a doctor
on this flight?

892
01:51:31,151 --> 01:51:32,880
Please take a look at him

893
01:51:49,836 --> 01:51:52,100
He shouldn't be flying

894
01:51:53,006 --> 01:51:55,998
l can give him a check-up
at my hospital in Ramnagar

895
01:51:56,242 --> 01:51:59,507
l'll organise his trip to Delhi
after l've given him a check-up

896
01:51:59,946 --> 01:52:02,813
That's, if you don't mind.
- You're the best judge

897
01:52:06,686 --> 01:52:10,622
Send a wireless message.
Get an ambulance at the airport

898
01:52:41,821 --> 01:52:43,413
Who is it?

899
01:52:49,262 --> 01:52:53,358
So you laced my orange juice?
- Yes

900
01:52:54,267 --> 01:52:58,260
To help you sleep easy for a while

901
01:52:59,005 --> 01:53:02,270
lf you don't want to die...

902
01:53:03,143 --> 01:53:06,874
you will hand that locket to me.
- Certainly not. lt has been with me...

903
01:53:07,113 --> 01:53:11,516
ever since l was a child. lt's the
mark that identifies me to my family

904
01:53:11,985 --> 01:53:13,919
Give me the locket

905
01:53:14,387 --> 01:53:16,582
No one touches it

906
01:55:35,628 --> 01:55:36,993
Thief

907
01:55:37,163 --> 01:55:40,758
l'm no thief!
- You robbed the crown

908
01:55:41,367 --> 01:55:43,995
Now you're back...?
- No, l was only...

909
01:55:46,172 --> 01:55:51,542
This belongs to the Prince.
And someday he will return

910
01:55:52,178 --> 01:55:55,375
Until then, l will protect
this property

911
01:55:58,518 --> 01:56:00,452
Get out of here

912
01:56:01,154 --> 01:56:04,646
lf you set foot inside this palace
ever again, l'll hack you to pieces

913
01:56:05,558 --> 01:56:09,085
Robber... rogue

914
01:56:44,564 --> 01:56:46,691
Take care of him.
- Sure

915
01:56:47,033 --> 01:56:50,901
A falcon snatched my handgun.
l'm going to look for it

916
01:57:03,282 --> 01:57:05,477
Shamsher...? Where did you find gun?

917
01:57:05,952 --> 01:57:11,549
l see. The robber tried to kill you?
l won't spare him

918
01:57:41,354 --> 01:57:42,844
Prince

919
01:57:50,863 --> 01:57:52,455
My prince

920
01:59:43,309 --> 01:59:47,075
You see how happy Shamsher is?
Because it's your birthday

921
01:59:48,514 --> 01:59:50,277
This is my gift to you

922
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:56,350
To the Prince...
- Victory be

923
01:59:56,622 --> 01:59:58,783
To the Maharaja...
- Victory be

924
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:06,563
Shamsher...

925
02:00:09,535 --> 02:00:15,132
Where did you find that locket?
- l've worn it ever since l was a baby

926
02:00:15,641 --> 02:00:18,804
Where it came from,
only my Daddy can tell you

927
02:00:22,682 --> 02:00:23,478
Yes son...?

928
02:00:24,183 --> 02:00:24,808
Why did you call me here?

929
02:00:25,251 --> 02:00:27,947
Everyone thinks l'm the prince
because l'm wearing this locket

930
02:00:34,493 --> 02:00:38,623
Yes, that's the locket l was trying
to save from Lakhan Singh

931
02:00:38,864 --> 02:00:41,389
So l gave it to the Prince

932
02:00:43,369 --> 02:00:46,634
My sacrifices have borne fruit,
Lakhan Singh

933
02:00:52,278 --> 02:00:54,212
A piece of paper...?

934
02:00:54,547 --> 02:00:58,347
No, that's the map to the
royal treasures in Anjangarh

935
02:00:58,951 --> 02:01:02,148
The route of to the treasure
from the lake-shore

936
02:01:03,923 --> 02:01:09,361
And where's the lake?
- l know the way. l'll take you there

937
02:01:12,265 --> 02:01:15,701
Can you tell us how your son
came to possess this locket?

938
02:01:17,536 --> 02:01:19,128
Tell me

939
02:01:19,472 --> 02:01:25,638
Why don't you say anything, Daddy?
Am l not your son?

940
02:01:27,813 --> 02:01:31,146
Tell us the truth. Tell us
he isn't your son

941
02:01:31,817 --> 02:01:34,752
Tell us, he's the prince,
the heir to the royal lineage

942
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:40,585
No Daddy! Tell me, it's a lie!
l'm your son

943
02:01:41,994 --> 02:01:43,928
Why are you silent?

944
02:01:45,064 --> 02:01:50,161
The truth is... Ranjit isn't my son

945
02:01:52,004 --> 02:01:53,938
l found him lying in the jungles

946
02:01:54,173 --> 02:01:58,940
Hear that? Didn't l tell you?
He's the prince! My prince

947
02:02:00,246 --> 02:02:05,980
Truly, he must be royalty.
Ever since he entered my family...

948
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:09,381
my business has grown
by leaps and bounds

949
02:02:10,589 --> 02:02:12,989
Even my wife conceived

950
02:02:15,861 --> 02:02:20,662
Before she died,
my wife swore me to secrecy

951
02:02:22,234 --> 02:02:28,332
Till this day, Asha doesn't know
that Ranjit isn't her brother

952
02:02:31,077 --> 02:02:35,013
But no promises hold
before destiny's writ

953
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:45,552
You have my word. My son will marry
your daughter, Seema

954
02:02:45,991 --> 02:02:52,863
No! l'm never going to marry him.
l belong to Shankar, l will always

955
02:02:53,466 --> 02:02:57,732
l'll even wait for him
a whole lifetime

956
02:03:00,306 --> 02:03:03,571
ln our age, l don't think we can
force our children into a marriage

957
02:03:04,610 --> 02:03:06,578
And we mustn't

958
02:03:09,281 --> 02:03:10,578
My child...
- Forgive me

959
02:03:26,532 --> 02:03:31,799
l was accompanying the children.
Your friend was signing autographs

960
02:03:32,204 --> 02:03:35,799
Suddenly, he fainted. A doctor attended
to him. He was a bearded man

961
02:03:36,275 --> 02:03:39,540
He took him away in an ambulance
at Ramnagar airport

962
02:03:40,246 --> 02:03:42,407
And yes, he rolled his cigarettes

963
02:03:46,252 --> 02:03:50,188
He rolled his cigarettes
... he used his hands...?

964
02:03:52,258 --> 02:03:54,192
l know nothing more

965
02:03:56,695 --> 02:04:00,358
l hope you find your friend soon.
l shall pray to God

966
02:04:07,306 --> 02:04:10,241
Where have you been?
- How have you guys been?

967
02:04:28,661 --> 02:04:31,061
What happened?
- For the first time, l missed

968
02:04:31,397 --> 02:04:36,061
Shankar walked in and he saved them!
- What nonsense! Shankar is dead

969
02:04:42,908 --> 02:04:45,274
l think they followed me here

970
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:50,615
Between the three of them
is it a friendship unto death?

971
02:04:51,517 --> 02:04:53,849
Get out. Take the road
behind the church

972
02:04:58,457 --> 02:04:59,890
The padre

973
02:05:56,115 --> 02:05:59,050
Didn't l tell you?
He is no padre

974
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:04,183
l must commend your
capability of recall

975
02:06:05,558 --> 02:06:07,082
Thakur saheb...?

976
02:06:07,927 --> 02:06:12,261
Asha's Daddy...?
- As your flight took off...

977
02:06:12,598 --> 02:06:15,260
he stood watching.
- Which means...

978
02:06:15,501 --> 02:06:17,765
the man inside the plane
and the doctor...?

979
02:06:18,037 --> 02:06:22,531
Yes. The doctor was my son. Ranjit

980
02:06:23,309 --> 02:06:26,244
And your goons were in the ambulance

981
02:06:28,213 --> 02:06:30,374
You got it right.
- So you wanted to kill us?

982
02:06:30,749 --> 02:06:35,049
You had us trussed up
on the railway tracks?

983
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:39,382
And the man with the steel teeth
was one of your dogs

984
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:44,152
ln the end my dogs will
chew your bones

985
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:46,796
Before that, we'll drink your blood

986
02:07:44,723 --> 02:07:48,181
No point waiting.
Let's inform the police

987
02:07:53,165 --> 02:07:55,656
Come on Montu,
don't be stubborn

988
02:07:57,236 --> 02:08:01,070
l've looked everywhere in the
graveyard. But no sign of them

989
02:08:59,098 --> 02:09:05,037
God has answered your prayers! Look,
the dungeons... they must be in there

990
02:09:36,935 --> 02:09:39,130
No! Don't go in there

991
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:31,074
Montu! Spin the wheel
to the left. Hurry

992
02:11:34,386 --> 02:11:36,320
Let go of me

993
02:11:36,655 --> 02:11:38,589
No, not the kid

994
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:51,125
Montu! My son!
You're speaking again

995
02:11:51,737 --> 02:11:53,466
Yes Daddy

996
02:11:54,206 --> 02:11:56,970
Blood...? And what's this?

997
02:12:00,045 --> 02:12:02,013
The wheel.
- Yes Daddy

998
02:12:02,247 --> 02:12:03,737
Leave me

999
02:12:46,792 --> 02:12:50,853
Ranjit! Our path has been cleared
of every thorn

1000
02:12:51,496 --> 02:12:58,425
The Maharaja's wealth is ours
and the Anjangarh treasure is ours

1001
02:13:00,639 --> 02:13:07,568
The wealth, the treasure... and l
am Anjangarh's Prince Ranjit Singh

1002
02:13:08,413 --> 02:13:14,648
King! My son is a king

1003
02:13:16,655 --> 02:13:18,247
Your son...?

1004
02:13:18,490 --> 02:13:25,020
No... you found me in the jungle
didn't you?

1005
02:13:27,833 --> 02:13:33,430
l have fooled them!
And now, you are their prince

1006
02:13:36,541 --> 02:13:38,907
When it comes to fooling people
you are unequalled

1007
02:13:39,244 --> 02:13:44,147
After a lifetime in your company l've
picked up a few of the finer points

1008
02:13:44,616 --> 02:13:47,483
Why not?
Like father, like son

1009
02:13:47,753 --> 02:13:48,651
No

1010
02:13:50,522 --> 02:13:51,454
Not son

1011
02:13:53,425 --> 02:13:54,983
And you know it very well

1012
02:13:55,761 --> 02:14:01,700
My father was Digambar Singh,
the Maharaja's cousin

1013
02:14:03,068 --> 02:14:04,865
lsn't that so, Lakhan?

1014
02:14:07,439 --> 02:14:13,036
My father was naive. 20 years ago,
you incited him to raid Anjangarh

1015
02:14:13,478 --> 02:14:19,383
For the treasure. You remember?
And it was because of you...

1016
02:14:19,718 --> 02:14:24,417
that my poor father lost his life.
- To pay for what l owed him...

1017
02:14:24,790 --> 02:14:31,423
l reared you like a son.
- That doesn't make you my father

1018
02:14:33,298 --> 02:14:35,232
A midwife is never a mother

1019
02:14:35,500 --> 02:14:39,436
Lakhan Singh, it's blue blood
that runs in my veins

1020
02:14:40,539 --> 02:14:45,476
Get this clear. l am the rightful
claimant to the royal treasure

1021
02:14:45,911 --> 02:14:50,780
Only l.
- Ranjit! Don't try to fly too high

1022
02:14:52,284 --> 02:14:54,980
l know how to clip wings

1023
02:14:57,255 --> 02:15:02,090
Pick a quarrel with Lakhan Singh and
you will never get to the treasure

1024
02:15:03,562 --> 02:15:07,965
No threats. My blue blood
isn't accustomed to threats

1025
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:13,299
You may have shaved that beard.
Don't you think you've wiped off...

1026
02:15:13,572 --> 02:15:15,506
the sins of your past

1027
02:15:17,075 --> 02:15:21,512
Remember the
Deputy lnspector General...

1028
02:15:21,746 --> 02:15:27,309
is still looking
for the Maharaja's assassin

1029
02:15:28,653 --> 02:15:32,282
Had l known l was rearing a snake...

1030
02:15:32,657 --> 02:15:36,286
Would you have strangled me?

1031
02:15:38,997 --> 02:15:45,596
The snake has reared its hood.
- l know how to defang the snake

1032
02:15:48,673 --> 02:15:51,642
They use guns to scare kids

1033
02:15:54,045 --> 02:15:55,945
The bullets are with me

1034
02:15:59,718 --> 02:16:05,657
This one isn't empty.
5 bullets still remain. Get it?

1035
02:16:07,159 --> 02:16:09,650
But... l'm no killer

1036
02:16:10,729 --> 02:16:12,993
Royal blood runs in my veins

1037
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:17,930
For 20 years, you have protected
the scion of the royal family

1038
02:16:18,436 --> 02:16:20,768
Therefore l will spare your life

1039
02:16:22,974 --> 02:16:26,774
But remember... don't try to follow me

1040
02:16:27,379 --> 02:16:29,779
The loyal Mangal Singh
is with me

1041
02:16:30,382 --> 02:16:35,786
Even after years, he recognises your
voice. He identified you at the hospital

1042
02:16:37,622 --> 02:16:41,683
Were he not blindfolded, he would've
broken your hands then and there...

1043
02:16:41,893 --> 02:16:48,162
to avenge the amputated arm.
To protect his prince...

1044
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:51,333
he can kill a hundred like Lakhan

1045
02:16:59,077 --> 02:17:05,141
Hi brother! Where to?
- l'm not your brother

1046
02:17:06,117 --> 02:17:11,350
Are you in your senses?
- Yes, l've just recovered my senses

1047
02:17:11,856 --> 02:17:14,017
Brother...
- Didn't l tell you?

1048
02:17:14,226 --> 02:17:20,790
You aren't my sister. Royal blood runs
in my veins. Yours is a bandit's blood

1049
02:17:22,267 --> 02:17:24,963
lf l'm unbelievable,
ask your Daddy

1050
02:17:31,977 --> 02:17:34,844
Daddy, what's come over brother?
Why is he behaving so strangely?

1051
02:17:35,580 --> 02:17:39,141
He's no more your brother.
He is our enemy

1052
02:17:39,651 --> 02:17:41,846
He says, l carry a bandit's blood

1053
02:17:44,222 --> 02:17:46,156
He was raving

1054
02:17:47,192 --> 02:17:48,682
Go upstairs.
- But Daddy...

1055
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:49,417
Go

1056
02:17:55,934 --> 02:17:57,265
Tarun

1057
02:17:57,936 --> 02:18:00,666
Yes Thakur saheb...?
- Go over to the house on the hill

1058
02:18:01,006 --> 02:18:03,873
To the mob?
- Yes. And say...

1059
02:18:04,109 --> 02:18:06,270
Lakhan has issued summons

1060
02:18:07,112 --> 02:18:11,515
l have the map to the treasure

1061
02:18:12,317 --> 02:18:15,878
lf Lakhan know how to rear a snake...

1062
02:18:16,321 --> 02:18:19,256
he also knows how to defang the snake

1063
02:18:21,393 --> 02:18:25,454
Asha! You can't even imagine
the truth about your Daddy

1064
02:18:26,231 --> 02:18:32,932
l know. l was under the illusion that
l was the daughter of an angelic Dad

1065
02:18:35,974 --> 02:18:40,911
But now l am ashamed to think
of myself as his daughter

1066
02:18:41,346 --> 02:18:47,615
Asha, but that's no fault of yours.
- Seema l don't know...

1067
02:18:48,086 --> 02:18:53,353
why he wanted to kill them,
but l know he's a murderer

1068
02:18:54,693 --> 02:18:57,491
He was the one who cut off
Mangal Singh's arm

1069
02:18:58,029 --> 02:19:00,759
He was the one who murdered
the Maharaja...

1070
02:19:01,299 --> 02:19:03,859
to get at the treasures
of Anjangarh

1071
02:19:06,638 --> 02:19:09,334
The assassin who killed
the Maharaja of Anjangarh?

1072
02:19:10,508 --> 02:19:16,276
My father's murderer...?
- Yes, he's Lakhan Singh

1073
02:19:16,681 --> 02:19:21,015
Mangal Singh thinks Ranjit is the prince.
He's leading him to the treasure

1074
02:19:22,087 --> 02:19:25,818
Fraud! You spilled the beans
in your stupor

1075
02:19:26,224 --> 02:19:29,591
Scoundrel! Are you trying to usurp
the prince's place?

1076
02:19:31,096 --> 02:19:33,621
l have taken his place.
- Never

1077
02:19:34,099 --> 02:19:36,761
l will never allow a bandit's son
to touch the treasure

1078
02:19:38,169 --> 02:19:44,039
l carry royal blood. Not Lakhan's son
l am Digamber Singh's son

1079
02:19:47,679 --> 02:19:53,083
Digamber Singh's son...?
- The man whom your Maharaja murdered

1080
02:19:53,785 --> 02:19:57,516
Like father, like son.
Both traitors

1081
02:19:58,189 --> 02:20:02,683
He died like a dog.
l'll kill you like a dog

1082
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:13,864
Lakhan made a mistake,
he only cut off one arm

1083
02:20:14,739 --> 02:20:18,675
l won't carve you up.
l'll leave you in one piece

1084
02:20:19,244 --> 02:20:23,943
Only wounded,
with gaping wounds all over

1085
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:31,155
But you won't be able to use
the wounds to breathe

1086
02:20:33,925 --> 02:20:35,859
Take him away

1087
02:20:47,272 --> 02:20:52,437
Hills all around.
- And none of us knows the way

1088
02:20:53,278 --> 02:20:57,942
Let's split up and find our way

1089
02:21:23,741 --> 02:21:26,266
Sanga is here

1090
02:21:29,714 --> 02:21:34,674
Sanga! You went away...
- And you forgot your parents?

1091
02:21:35,386 --> 02:21:41,291
How can anyone forget his parents?
l got busy with friends

1092
02:21:41,793 --> 02:21:44,057
Have the city-types
been visiting these parts?

1093
02:21:44,395 --> 02:21:47,853
Yes. The king of Anjangarh
has pitched tents by the lake

1094
02:21:52,403 --> 02:21:54,894
Where are you off to, son?
Listen...

1095
02:23:11,816 --> 02:23:13,750
He's badly wounded

1096
02:23:14,819 --> 02:23:18,186
He's going to be fine.
Fetch the salve

1097
02:23:18,423 --> 02:23:19,219
Don't worry son.

1098
02:23:19,591 --> 02:23:22,526
When you were about six we found you
outside the Anjangarh palace

1099
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:28,127
Your back was scarred. Sword wounds.
- Sword wounds...?

1100
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:32,627
Yes, it was the prince's birthday.
The bandits raided the palace

1101
02:23:33,204 --> 02:23:35,536
That's when they killed the king

1102
02:23:38,776 --> 02:23:41,404
He's my son!
- What...?

1103
02:23:42,113 --> 02:23:47,813
Lakhan Singh was the one who scarred
you and he also killed the Maharaja

1104
02:23:50,388 --> 02:23:52,583
l am your unfortunate father

1105
02:23:53,124 --> 02:23:54,591
Father...?

1106
02:23:57,762 --> 02:23:59,093
Yes son

1107
02:24:01,165 --> 02:24:03,099
l am your father

1108
02:24:05,570 --> 02:24:09,267
Tomorrow, l will cross the lake

1109
02:24:10,008 --> 02:24:12,772
And a treasure worth millions
will lie at my feet

1110
02:24:13,111 --> 02:24:16,603
lt will all be mine

1111
02:24:18,716 --> 02:24:20,650
Let the wine flow

1112
02:24:21,719 --> 02:24:25,246
We have women too.
- Women too?

1113
02:24:54,152 --> 02:24:56,780
''Salaams to everyone''

1114
02:24:57,288 --> 02:25:00,451
''We amuse everyone''

1115
02:25:00,892 --> 02:25:07,730
''Just watch our feats,
what we do tonight''

1116
02:25:08,199 --> 02:25:14,138
''What no one can do, we can''

1117
02:26:18,803 --> 02:26:21,533
''We live life
with a smile''

1118
02:26:22,006 --> 02:26:25,134
''We die
with a smile''

1119
02:26:25,943 --> 02:26:32,246
''Only God
we are afraid''

1120
02:26:32,984 --> 02:26:36,886
''That's all''

1121
02:27:57,268 --> 02:28:04,071
''We hold the keys
to every treasure''

1122
02:28:04,475 --> 02:28:11,074
''We can tell you about
the whole world''

1123
02:28:11,749 --> 02:28:18,120
''And we use our eyes to kill''

1124
02:28:53,925 --> 02:28:55,187
Asha...?

1125
02:29:13,611 --> 02:29:15,772
He's the man

1126
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:20,640
He was the one
who killed my Mummy

1127
02:31:52,269 --> 02:31:53,930
Stop

1128
02:32:30,674 --> 02:32:34,166
The royal treasure is inside.
Blow it up

1129
02:33:17,788 --> 02:33:20,279
Everyone stays back!
No one comes inside

1130
02:33:41,879 --> 02:33:45,110
All this... is mine

1131
02:33:45,950 --> 02:33:47,212
lt's all mine

1132
02:33:59,530 --> 02:34:02,590
What are you waiting for?
Fill the sacks

1133
02:34:21,619 --> 02:34:23,553
Hurry

1134
02:34:46,944 --> 02:34:53,247
The Lord's crown...? That means
someone has found the treasure

1135
02:34:53,984 --> 02:34:56,179
Take me there, quick

1136
02:37:02,613 --> 02:37:04,911
You aren't robbing the treasure

1137
02:37:06,884 --> 02:37:11,184
lt belongs to the people,
not to scoundrels like you

1138
02:37:13,424 --> 02:37:14,982
You...?

1139
02:37:16,260 --> 02:37:18,455
You are still alive?

1140
02:37:18,962 --> 02:37:27,301
No one can harm whom God protects

1141
02:37:30,908 --> 02:37:34,503
Fool! You have come here
to your death

1142
02:37:35,579 --> 02:37:38,207
Not even your God
can save you now

1143
02:37:39,650 --> 02:37:41,083
Fry him

1144
02:39:09,172 --> 02:39:15,543
Drag him to his father's memorial.
l'll set fire to his funeral pyre

1145
02:39:55,586 --> 02:39:59,886
Lakhan, your days are over

1146
02:40:01,725 --> 02:40:05,661
Will you bring to an end my days?
Using a lone arm?

1147
02:40:07,097 --> 02:40:12,125
l'll cut off the good arm today
and l'll give you the death...

1148
02:40:12,603 --> 02:40:17,040
that l gave your son.
- No one can harm whom God protects

1149
02:40:17,608 --> 02:40:24,537
Witness Lakhan, my son is still alive.
The one you tried to kill

1150
02:40:27,150 --> 02:40:31,052
Sanga... your son...?

1151
02:40:32,022 --> 02:40:36,584
Yes Lakhan, your sword
wasn't sharp enough...

1152
02:40:36,994 --> 02:40:42,591
to put an end to a life
bred in loyalty

1153
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:49,867
But the bullets in my gun
can kill every one of you

1154
02:44:18,682 --> 02:44:23,517
Now l'm going to fry
all of you. Together

1155
02:44:27,924 --> 02:44:29,357
Stop

1156
02:44:34,231 --> 02:44:37,325
Take that.
And shoot

1157
02:44:37,734 --> 02:44:40,567
Shoot! Why do you hesitate?

1158
02:44:41,171 --> 02:44:47,076
Get out of my way.
- No, you will kill me first

1159
02:44:47,644 --> 02:44:49,874
You are out of your mind.
Get out

1160
02:45:13,570 --> 02:45:19,509
Mangal Singh,
you are noble

1161
02:45:20,243 --> 02:45:23,474
Asha is the daughter
of someone as lowly as l am

1162
02:46:03,119 --> 02:46:06,919
Welcome, Prince.
Your estates await you

1163
02:46:07,590 --> 02:46:12,789
No Uncle Mangal. l'm no prince,
no claimant to these estates

1164
02:46:13,897 --> 02:46:18,596
As of now, friendship
is what matters most to me
