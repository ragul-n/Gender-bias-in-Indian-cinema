12
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,042
During the 1922 census,
a new era of..

13
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,542
... cast enrolment had just begun.

14
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,542
People were enrolling themselves
with changed identities of..

15
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,542
..their choice under the
umbrella of the British Empire.

16
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,167
My grandfather in haste to climb..

17
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:36,958
..the caste ladder
entered the Brahmins bogie.

18
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:38,625
He died within the year in fear..

19
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,417
..and guilt of travelling
with a fake caste-ticket.

20
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:42,625
Since then my whole caste-clan
is wandering like ghosts..

21
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,417
..disguised as Brahmins.

22
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:46,500
And I'm Gayatri...

23
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,667
...processed and purified, circulated
through the guts of a cow...

24
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:52,000
...the Studio Gobar [Bullshit].

25
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:05,167
'Why I named him Om, has a story.'

26
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:09,667
'It is said that if Saturn occurs in
an inauspicious house on his chart...

27
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:13,500
.. then the person will
die by the age of 17.'

28
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:16,292
It occurred to me that
the type 'Om' is not..

29
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:17,667
.. listed under any nomenclature..

30
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,417
..in the records of Yamdoot.
(Messenger of death).

31
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:21,292
If I named him Om..

32
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:24,500
..then he would become
untraceable to the God of death.

33
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,292
Om, go to school. It is time!

34
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:42,292
School is closed today!

35
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,792
- Why?
- It is going to rain.

36
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:44,917
How do you know?

37
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,500
Because you are combing your hair.

38
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:06,042
Om, had you come into my room?

39
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,958
- Why?
- Who was flying the rocket?

40
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,417
Russians and Americans.

41
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:13,000
Gayatri! Two horoscopes are missing.

42
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,375
I was matching them.

43
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,500
I was making the girl younger
in her horoscope, reducing her age..

44
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,542
..I don't know where
they disappeared.

45
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,000
Father, it is like giving
someone a travel map..

46
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,875
..of one city to find
her way in another city.

47
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,500
Then escape to a place where the
clock dial can't swallow you.

48
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,750
Do you know what love is?

49
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,000
LOVE

50
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,167
'L' is lake of sorrow.

51
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,792
'O' is ocean of tears.

52
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,542
'V' is valley of death.

53
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,167
And finally, 'E', end of life.

54
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,250
Love can't be bought
in the market-place.

55
00:07:58,667 --> 00:07:59,875
I love you.

56
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:09,042
Will you wrestle with me?

57
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,167
I'm sorry, but it is your fault also.

58
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,542
You looked so bold sitting alone
amongst the men in the cinema hall..

59
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:27,750
..that I fell in love with you.

60
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,250
Because I was alone?

61
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:33,917
Girls, after running away from home,
have only two places to hide ...

62
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,250
Either the temple or the cinema hall.

63
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,875
Can you hop behind onto the carrier
of my bicycle...

64
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:40,958
... giving you a lift!

65
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,792
Myself Jagdish, from Jhumritalaiya.

66
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,167
Thank you.

67
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,667
'This letter is from
an admirer of this program..

68
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,042
...from Jhumritaliya, Jagdish.'

69
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,417
'He writes,
now on he should be considered..

70
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:09,667
..from Ajmer instead
of Jhumritaliya.'

71
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,125
'Mr. Jagdish, you changed your city..

72
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,667
... but your favourite song remains
the same, forever.'

73
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,417
'He wants to hear the same song
as always.'

74
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:19,500
'Jagdish, Gayatri, Om, Tinku,
Nikki, Pinky, Dolly..

75
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,958
..and their parents from Ajmer.'

76
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,250
"Babloo from Babylon."

77
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:27,625
"Babli on the telephone."

78
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,875
"Babloo from Babylon."

79
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,375
"Babli on the telephone."

80
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,542
"Pawned, missing and un-named
in his own home'

81
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,958
'Friends from the world of voices...'

82
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:41,292
'I had not even thought
in my dreams that..

83
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:42,625
..the girl who requested for the
same song..

84
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,167
.. in the request program,
would meet me in the picture hall.'

85
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,542
'Who knows, the names connected
in this request show..

86
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,792
..may also be related
across many births.

87
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,417
Open the window
so that I can see you.

88
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:53,250
'The shepherd hiding
inside the doll.'

89
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:58,375
"A shepherd woven from Babli's
woollens." 'The shepherd hiding...

90
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:01,042
...inside the doll.'
'Take care of my bicycle. Yours, J.'

91
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,958
"Zero hero, fail or pass."

92
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:08,667
"Zero hero, fail or pass."

93
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,667
Give me 10 bucks.

94
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,417
Tell me the signs.

95
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,042
We first connected through the radio.

96
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,958
Okay.

97
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,000
- Then we met in the picture hall.
- Okay.

98
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,667
- And recently on the road.
- Okay.

99
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,042
I don't know if there
is something to it.

100
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,625
Come here, I'll give you a spell,

101
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,000
...the girl will
fall for you forever.

102
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,667
Shankar, what spells are you selling?

103
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:37,042
Mr. Melaram! Mr. Lotaram has buried
all the spells in the court premises.

104
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,667
Even you are going
to be a minister soon.

105
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:40,875
Thank you.

106
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,875
I promise. I promise.

107
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:48,167
Babuji B. Shankar, present yourself!

108
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:54,167
'You've been suspended from service
for issuing fake caste-certificates.'

109
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,917
'You've been unsuccessful
in proving that...

110
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,667
... your relatives belong to
the scheduled castes.'

111
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,000
'It so happened that
Babuji found some..

112
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,375
..young men of the third generation..

113
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,500
.. of his caste-clan,
in the guise of Brahmins,..

114
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,875
... unemployed and begging
at the railways stations.

115
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:15,500
'Babuji was a gazetted
officer of authority.

116
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,417
Feeling pity on the lost members
of his wandering clan ..

117
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,125
..he issued them
fake caste-certificates,

118
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,875
restoring them back
to the lower caste.

119
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,292
Through the reserved caste quota...

120
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:25,250
... these people quietly kept
infiltrating government offices.'

121
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,042
'What could I do?'

122
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:32,042
'The boys were hassling me
- Uncle, get us a job! Get us a job!'

123

'I said, here,

uproot the hairlock from your head,

'... and stamp this seal
on this worthless piece of paper.'

the sign of Saturn.'

"Beloved, come and embrace me."

00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:30,542
"Come and embrace me."

perfumed her hair..."

"She puffed powder on the face and
perfumed her hair..."

161
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:06,042
"... spent the night at the hotel,
and passed the day in the theater."

162
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,125
"- With new fashion.
- Yes."

"- With new position.
- Oh."

164
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,292

"- With new position.
- Oh."

166

"A hollow laugh,
how wedged in my heart!"

"A hollow laugh,
how wedged in my heart!"

"I, in spite of it.."

169
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,542
'O naÃ¯ve one, casting my spell
on my own daughter ...'

170
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:14,750
'Hold the pose, I'll make you
famous right away.'

171
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,958
I'm sorry.

172
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,792
'Hello conman.'

173
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:58,417
- I have come first again.
- Where?

174
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,958
At school... in holding my breath.

175
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,167
Gayatri,
will you learn to ride a cycle?

176
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:04,917
I'll buy a second-hand one for you.

177
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,542
Jagdish, don't abandon me midway.

178
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,292
Om!

179
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,042
Where are you coming from?

180
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,417
I was at community service in school.

181
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,625
In all that dirt?

182
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,042
What does it matter to you?

183
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:35,750
Who washes your clothes?

184
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:36,917
Don't wash.

185
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:38,375
Will you ride the cycle?

186
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,958
He rides a lot, in scissor-style!

187
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:42,542
Then go ahead.

188
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,167
Listen, come home straight.

189
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:20,250
"Who moved ahead?"

190
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:24,167
"Who stepped back?"

191
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:28,250
"Who moved ahead?"

192
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,792
"Who stepped back?"

193
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,417
"Baboo or baboon."

194
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:24,167
'That day everyone was looking at you
in the picture hall.'

195
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,958
'Why were you were sitting in the
gents section?'

196
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,667
'It was dark.'

197
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,667
'But the usher has a torch.'

198
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,292
He is the one who took me there.

199
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,417
And then he came and sat next to you?

200
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:42,042
Jagdish, can girls climb the Everest
without the help of guys?

201
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:43,792
Parvati had climbed it.

202
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:44,958
What about Shiv?

203
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:47,417
I heard Ganesh is not their own son.

204
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,917
I heard the grandma's
post is vacant on the moon.

205
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,125
Can you spin yarn?

206
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,292
Gayatri, why don't you graduate
through correspondence?

207
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,167
What will I gain?

208
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,167
You'll become independent.

209
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,042
I've learnt to ride the bicycle,
that's enough.

210
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,167
Being free and being independent...

211
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,917
..are two different things.

212
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:15,000
What are you?

213
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:18,125
Jagdish, Bachelor of Science.

214
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,042
Tuition master.
I teach to ride the bicycles.

215
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:24,792
I make enough.

216
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,667
How much would you
make from one tuition?

217
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,417
Give me food!

218
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,542
Om, where is the cycle?

219
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:46,667
Down the well!

220
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,167
I'll go and look.

221
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,125
Why do you send my name in your
requests for these dirty songs?

222
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:57,125
'Today man is going
to step on the moon.'

223
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,917
'The first astronaut
was Yuri Gagarin.'

224
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:01,792
'He liked India very much.'
- Om! Om!

225
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:03,167
Sister, is Om there at home?

226
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:04,917
'In poor countries..'

227
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:07,000
Om, will you come
to my birthday party?'

228
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,667
But I don't have
a present to give you.

229
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,042
No one has presents.

230
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:11,292
- Come on, hurry up.
- Come on.

231
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,792
- Okay, I will come.
- Come on.

232
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,167
'Does man want to be free of
nitrogen's oppression?'

233
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:17,292
'Nitrogen is neither a non-living
thing nor a living thing.'

234
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,792
'Sometimes it is poison and
sometimes it is protein.'

235
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,542
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

236
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:24,250
we will go ..

237
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,417
..where the living
are free of nitrogen.'

238
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,167
'While offering the prayers
they were all massacred,.'

239
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:33,000
'... when the smell
of the dead reached..

240
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,000
..the foot of the hill,
Khwaja Garib Nawaz..

241
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,125
..called upon his
army and marched up,

242
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,417
and buried six to eight
martyrs in each grave.'

243
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,500
'After burying them, he immediately..

244
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,542
..made a grand mausoleum
in their honour...

245
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,375
..which is now known
as 'Ganj Shahida.'

246
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,042
People go there
and make offerings,...

247
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,417
..they keep lemons, shells, coins,..

248
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:55,042
..they keep money.
This is how Taragarh got its name.

249
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:58,292
Later on the Britisher's came and...

250
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,167
...kept their army there.

251
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:01,417
They made quarters.

252
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:03,042
The entire army used to stay there.

253
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,250
Even now in Rajasthan,
Taragarh is the highest fort.

254
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,500
There's a big transmitter there.

255
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,167
There are also many
picnic spots in Taragarh.

256
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,625
... though the bungalows
are mostly vacant...

257
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,417
... there is still a population
of 500 people.

258
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,542
People live there in groups.

259
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,500
There are nice bungalows.

260
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,792
There are good roads.

261
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:23,542
There's a big shrine built there.

262
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,042
There is a gigantic
entrance to the fort...

263
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:29,042
... great kings have left their
impressions there.

264
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,167
There is a shrine for a horse...

265
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:34,667
... at this shrine people
offer Bengal gram.

266
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,000
At the shrine of Mir Sayed Hussain..

267
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,250
..they offer flowers
and burn incense sticks.

268
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,292
The horse shrine is different where
they offer Bengal gram..

269
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,000
..and the shrine of Mir Sayed
Hussain is next to it..

270
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,792
..where they offer flowers and
incense stick.

271
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,625
- Hi.
- Are you coming to the moon?

272
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,125
What will I do there?

273
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,750
Just like that, for a vacation.

274
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,375
I heard they knit
nice sweaters there.

275
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,542
What the hell will they knit?

276
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,250
O shepherd,
o shepherd, shepherd Gopala...

277
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,250
Ibrahim! Ibrahim!

278
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:18,167
Tell aunty to prepare
the samosa [savoury] terrace.

279
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,917
With the help of herbs, the girl
blossomed back to health.

280
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,292
Psychologically too,
if this whole world..

281
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,292
..believes her to be 25,
then overnight she will turn 25..

282
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,167
Listen to me. Listen to me.

283
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm scared.

284
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,292
I hope they don't reject her.

285
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,417
- Where is she?
- On the samosa terrace.

286
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,667
Okay.

287
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,667
And what about her?

288
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,292
What about her, she dumped him?

289
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:43,000
After Mrs. Kakukabad, she was the
first liberated lady of our club ..

290
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,417
O let it be...but it was Ms.
Chanchalta who wore...

291
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,667
.. sleeveless blouses
for the first time.

292
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:50,125
How many ladies nowadays can carry
off that style?

293
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:52,500
Hurry up.

294
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,125
Uncle, uncle, you can see everything,
you are cheating.

295
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,292
I won last time too.

296
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:58,750
Why will I cheat? You are as dear
to me as the others.

297
00:23:58,875 --> 00:23:59,667
Ganesh, ring the bell, start again.

298
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:00,625
You invited him to my party,

299
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,417
and you didn't even introduce me
to the professor.

300
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,042
Forgive me, I was busy with
Choti [bride to be].

301
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:06,375
I'll introduce you right away.

302
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,667
Listen to me.

303
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:08,958
Listen!

304
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,625
So Professor, how is it going with
your Science?

305
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,292
Seems like a plot is being hatched.

306
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:18,542
I see. So now you are imprisoned
in the arms of this city.

307
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,542
Before man reaches the moon..

308
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,250
... this alliance should be made.

309
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,250
Father had reduced the age...

310
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,125
... but I heard the boy's family have
a computer at home.

311
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,417
You are sitting in
Bombay and showing off...

312
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,125
...it must be a toy for counting.

313
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,667
Actually, I belong to this city.

314
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,625
I've actually come
on a vacation here.

315
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,042
What are you going on about
'actually' standing there?

316
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:37,542
'Jump and come over to this side.'

317
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,917
How do you like our Chhoti?
[bride to be].

318
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:48,292
Don't evaluate like a scientist,
speak from your heart.

319
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:50,167
From here?

320
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,792
Go and see her up close.

321
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,667
Pinky, take brother-in-law
to Chhoti.

322
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:57,542
Brother-in-law, let's go.

323
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,417
I hope you don't think that..

324
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:06,667
... my brother had planted me?

325
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:11,667
When you were in Science,
I was in Arts.

326
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,875
You had saved me from goons
at the Information Center.

327
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:18,625
- My date of birth is..
- I know.

328
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:22,292
In a little while, man will walk
on the moon.

329
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:39,292
'This time, the main reason for
this trip is..

330
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,292
..that the samples found on the moon
will be shared..

331
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,917
..in all the countries equally
for experimentation...'

332
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,542
'...because only the rich
can go on the moon..'

333
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:47,542
Sorry, I thought
it was my lost bicycle.

334
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,542
I hope you are not hurt.

335
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:08,625
- Stand.
- Yes.

336
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,917
- Pedal.
- I did.

337
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:11,042
- Bell..
- I did.

338
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:13,292
- Anything special?
- A kid's seat on the rod.

339
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:15,042
You can take your bicycle.

340
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:25,958
In the whole film, I've been shown
lodged inside Babli's womb.

341
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:29,542
This was the most challenging
role of my life.

342
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:33,167
Listen to Raju Star's favorite
film's, favorite song.

343
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,292
Requested by..

344
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:35,875
[typed text] - Dear Tulsi, We only believe in
the present, no one is going to ask for your past.

345
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,958
..Jagdish, Gayatri, Tinku, Nikki, Pinky,
Dolly and their parents from Ajmer.

346
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:41,125
The strange thing is that Om is not
amongst them this time.

347
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,625
"Babloo from Babylon."

348
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,167
"Babli on the telephone."

349
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,542
"Babloo from Babylon."

350
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,125
"Babli on the telephone."

351
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:04,250
"Pawned, missing and un-named
in his own home'

352
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:10,042
"A shepherd woven
with Babli's woolens ."

353
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:13,542
"Shepherd hiding inside the doll."

354
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,125
Gayatri!!!

355
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:28,625
Father, Lala is here.

356
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,542
Today, it wasn't your daughter
who served me food?

357
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,750
Gayatri, get the brakes
of the bicycle tightened.

358
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,125
Why doesn't he buy a new one?

359
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:42,167
Our company's luck runs on your
bicycle's luck.

360
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:46,000
Gayatri, how I had come here
to make you independent...

361
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:47,750
... and look how I am now
dependent!

362
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,917
Hello? Is it the collector speaking?

363
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,250
Sir, I recognized you.

364
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,875
You wanted to meet me much earlier.

365
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:01,375
I didn't get time, but I'll tell you
everything that you wanted to know.

366
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,417
Okay. You want to ask me about
the horoscope that you gave me?

367
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:06,667
The line on your palm is
crystal clear.

368
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,958
The tick-tick clock of
Metamorphosis ...

369
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:12,292
..when frogs put on horseshoes...

370
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,167
.. and sailed on ships...

371
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,917
... looking for cities where there
was no fear of snakes.

372
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:19,375
The tick-tick clock of
metamorphosis ...

373
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,000
..when the memoires of the future
were printed on the thumb...

374
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,958
...the tadpoles asked:

375
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:25,792
What causes an intelligence?

376
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,542
What causes the face?

377
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:31,667
Is there a tadpole's heart underneath
the green skin of a frog?

378
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:35,958
In this red light city of the womb,
when I got lost inside Babli...

379
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:38,750
..during the reverse journey
of my genetic memory...

380
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:41,292
...I came across terrorist tadpoles..

381
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:44,500
where the emperor of frogs, the
computer, ruled over his subjects.

382
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,917
Sir Xerox Jhapata had only nitrogen
for his breakfast...

383
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,292
... terrorist tadpoles had refused to
grow into frogs.

384
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:55,042
They raised their weapons against
the tyranny of nitrogen.

385
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,375
Meanwhile in the
house of Rana tigrina..

386
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,625
..frogs were making the tadpoles
aware of their true nature.

387
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,667
"Like a cocoon's karma makes it
blossom into a butterfly..."

388
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,917
"... so we grow, from
tadpoles."

389
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,625
"Like a cocoon's karma makes it
blossom into a butterfly..."

390
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:21,417
"... so we grow, from
tadpoles."

391
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,542
There is a girl's corpse here.

392
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:31,167
Om..

393
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:36,667
Atlas is going bananas. He says he
will leave school.

394
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:38,167
Atlas!

395
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:42,042
Om, the school has vanished
from my mind.

396
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:44,792
From now on Atlas's house is
on the seat of his cycle.

397
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,167
What will you do?

398
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,250
Until I enter the book
of Guinness records..

399
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,667
..I will not get
down from the bi-cycle.

400
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:53,167
Atlas, don't be a fool.
Let's go to the school.

401
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:59,667
'Each one of us live alone in our
self-enclosed Hiber-Nation'

402
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:02,167
O we yogis

00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:04,042
O we consumers

404
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:06,167
O we renouncers

405
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:10,875
Closing all the gates of our bodies
we lie inert inside,

406
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:13,250
in our hibernation.

407
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:15,542
O we

408
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,417
O we

O we, without being through the wombs
of our teachers, we are twice born

410
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:32,875
O king Tigrina, O queen Tigrini

411
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:41,958
O third eye, O first ray of sun

412
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:55,917
I croak and crave for the
well of our everyday sustenance

413
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:02,500
... I croak for the rain...

414
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:06,375
... taker a motor to the picnic...

415
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:11,542
O us

... the lord of the heart,
the bank of the blood...

417
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:15,750
O us

... the furnace of the lungs...

419
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,875
O us

... the lord of the heart,
the bank of the blood...

we swim and breath in

427
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:51,042

.porn pictures of Coca-Cola, I croak...

00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:55,042
... thumbs up,
thumbs up, come up, come up...

429
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,042
"NAME?"

430
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,542
Rana!

431
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:16,917
"NAME?"

432
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,375
Rani!

433
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:22,667
"NAME?"

00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:24,667
Rana.

Is Akbar at home?

464
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:30,875
He would've gone to Taragarh...

465
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,167
... or the 'monument of two
and half days'.

466
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:34,000
- Were you in the school?
- Yes.

467
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:37,417
- Akbar said you dropped out.
- Yes.

468
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:38,792
What will you do now?

469
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:40,875
I'll go to the ocean.

470
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,375
- What will you do there?
- I'll join the navy.

471
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,042
What will you get there?

472
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:46,958
- They have nice uniforms.
- Let it be.

473
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,792
Who takes a job just
for the fancy uniform?

474
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,292
What is in your hand?

475
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,000
It is Atlas's photo.

476
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,417
Why? What happened to that poor guy?

477
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,417
- He has become famous.
- I see.

478
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,375
- ...and this blood on the news-paper?
- It is his only.

479
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:03,792
I see.

480
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:10,625
[Incantation to hanuman,
the monkey god.]

481
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,917
Akbar, I can see my nose.

482
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,667
Your nose is growing
big like an Arabs.

483
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:17,542
Go to the great seer's shrine
and rub the tip of your nose.

484
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,167
Hello..

485
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:01,917
Where is astrologer-palmist
B. Shankar's house?

486
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:12,417
Where is the astrologer
B. Shankar's house?

487
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:14,375
They've not given any direction.

488
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,750
Chhoti.

489
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:18,792
Come inside.

490
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:20,875
No, I have some urgent business
with him.

491
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,417
What business do you have with him?

492
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:25,417
Are you...? Are you here for the
same business?

493
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,875
- No...
- Choti.

494
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:29,667
Come on in.

495
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:31,042
No, I have to meet him.

496
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,417
My husband is calling you.

497
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,958
- Where will you stay?
- With him.

498
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:38,125
His 30 year old unmarried
daughter also lives with him.

499
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:41,875
She helps him with business.

500
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:45,417
Beware of Shankar, he will find
you a mate...

501
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:47,542
...but first he will purify himself
through you.

502
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,000
Even a big Bollywood
star had come to him.

503
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:54,292
She was the first
woman whom he told that..

504
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:57,542
..'there is an actress
hidden in every woman.'

505
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,750
In the role that you played, was the
tiger with you real?

506
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:04,792
We all got your postcards.

507
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:09,917
Will girls now really climb
the Everest without the help of men?

508
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,958
Sure. I must hurry...

509
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,250
...where is the house?

510
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,542
Look at this, Look at this! Once she
had her way with him ...

511
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,542
... she used magic to turn her lover
into a ass.

512
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:20,792
Then she murdered him.

513
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,625
Here is that unfortunate
ass's photo...

514
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,625
...on the tracks
under the goods train.

515
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,542
This here is that
unfaithful woman's picture.

516
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,375
Is somebody at home?

517
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:33,917
If I was in her place,
I would've kept that ass as a pet.

518
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:37,042
Gayatri, you don't know, even an
ass has teeth as big as piano keys.

519
00:38:38,042 --> 00:38:39,250
Excuse me.

520
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:43,167
- Greetings.
- Gayatri!

521
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:45,875
Greetings.

522
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,667
My name is Phool Kumari.
I'm from Bombay.

523
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:49,667
I read Times Of India daily.

524
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:51,042
That's where I read of you,
MARRIAGE AND MATCH.

525
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,875
Did you get my letter?

526
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,542
My correspondence code is..

527
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,292
..'the groom shouldn't
ask for the past.'

528
00:38:58,167 --> 00:38:59,958
I'm coming straight from
the station.

529
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,417
Father, she here is somebody straight
from the station..

530
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:03,667
..with a solitary suitcase.

531
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:05,792
Make her wash her face and then
show her to me.

532
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,625
Then, in real life my mother
gave birth to me..

533
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,417
..and died in real in a reel scene.

534
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,292
Then I was brought
up in the studio itself.

535
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:20,917
...and Guruji was making 9
films on 9 Goddesses.

536
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:22,167
Mythological.

537
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:25,167
Because mythologicals
have more repeat value.

538
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,917
The older the film, the more
religious it becomes.

539
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,875
Like one Goddess representing Monday,
another for Tuesday..

540
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:36,042
..like Goddess Santoshi for Friday.

541
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,542
So, I had got a role of the
Goddess of the Tigers.

542
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:51,375
But there was one clause
in our contracts...

543
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,917
...only one role in one lifetime.

544
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,625
...because, there was a question
of the image getting spoilt.

545
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,250
But what happened was..

546
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:03,042
...like you said
to that movie-star...

547
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,042
... 'there's an actress
hidden in every woman.'

548
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,667
So, even I wanted to play
different roles...

549
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,250
So, I ran away from the studio.

550
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,917
Guruji wanted to take me along...

551
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,667
...as his death-bride in his
live-Samadhi.

552
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:26,000
Before I could escape to Bombay..

553
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,917
..he had made Xeroxes of my
contract and had..

554
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:30,542
..sent it to all the studios.

555
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:33,292
I couldn't even get a role
of an extra: all doors were closed.

556
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:37,750
I had become so desperate that
I thought I would leave everything..

557
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:39,792
..and become a cabaret dancer.

558
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,417
But I was afraid that the movie
would get tainted.

559
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,917
If somebody gets peace from my
mythical image..

560
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:50,958
..then there is good in it for
me, isn't it?

561
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:55,625
By the way, there was no dearth
of anything in our studio.

562
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:58,125
Everyone had their own gardens.

563
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,792
Laxmi, who was richest of us..

564
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,875
- If you make a promise,
- ..all, had a pet owl.

565
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:04,667
"... you will have to fulfill it."

566
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:07,167
I told you that she looks ditto.,.

567
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:08,875
"- No matter if the world stops you.."
- Who?

568
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:09,917
"- No matter if.."
- She used to study with me..

569
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:10,875
"- the world stops you.."
- ..in the missionary school.

570
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,125
She was addicted to the movies.

571
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:13,542
I don't watch movies.

572
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,792
I don't get time from the
hustle-bustle of the studio...

573
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:17,250
... we had to give time to the
constant flow of devoted fans.

574
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,792
Strike a pose.

575
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:22,250
It is a dream of a marble palace.

576
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:24,125
Why are you making faces at it?

577
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:27,375
It is ok to live together, but dying
together? It is out of the question.

578
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:28,542
Good.

579
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:31,875
Father, who will you send
this photograph to?

580
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:35,167
This is the national echo - Agra.

581
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:43,667
But the groom will surely ask for
your past one day.

582
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:46,042
- I'll leave him.
- Until when?

583
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:47,750
As many as I can, as long as I can

584
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,042
This skull had come from
Paris to Pushkar to sell plaster.

585
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,500
Strike a pose.

586
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:54,667
Some of it has passed
and some still remains.

587
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:55,625
Good.

588
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:58,958
"You should keep your promise."

589
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,375
In this skull crows take flight
faster than the light.

590
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,917
- Post..
- Interpol.

591
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:06,917
There, all your secrets
will come undone.

592
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,250
"But consider that.."

593
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:10,500
Strike a pose.

594
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:13,625
"..whenever you call me,
I have to come."

595
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:16,542
Rs. 10 for a each photo,
Rs. 20 for correspondence..

596
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:20,042
..Rs. 100 for entertainment
and Rs.500 is our fees.

597
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:22,375
I don't have any money with me.

598
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:23,958
My trunk.

599
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,167
My trunk.

600
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:29,917
Oh! I got frightened!

601
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:32,917
Give me more to type.

602
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:36,375
Father, lets keep
her for the Company.

603
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:40,167
- Phool, was that city for real?
- Yes.

604
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,167
Type..

605
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:50,792
To, Miss Phool Kumari.

606
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:57,667
Subject: match and marriage.

607
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,042
Jagdish, why are you jealous?

608
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:02,292
I appoint you as my typewriter..

609
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:05,167
Gayatri, her real name is Rosemary.

610
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:06,167
Who is Rosemary?

611
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,750
Rosemary Marlowe.
[Fuck me everyday.]

612
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:08,958
Don't you recognize her?

613
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:10,750
She is a porn writer.

614
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:13,167
Jagdish, we have to
expand our company too...

615
00:43:13,417 --> 00:43:15,125
... and you know how
bad your English typing is...

616
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,167
...you are no competition to her.

617
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:29,167
Phool kept humiliating me and you
kept listening quietly?

618
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,167
Gayatri, each and every
sex-act is accounted for.

619
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,750
Even I can write poetry,

620
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:36,250
Sunset, onscreen,
behind the mountains..

621
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,417
..on the river. Sunset, on the sea.

622
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:41,667
The fluttering flags of the boats
like loin-cloths of fleeing ghosts.

623
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:44,167
Sunset, dust of the east in the
eyes of the west.

624
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,792
Sunset, like the ashes of mercury
under termites feet.

625
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:53,000
Chimney's scream
at the watchman's staff.

626
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:55,417
Buried under the roots
of a bonsai banyan tree, ...

627
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:57,167
.. inside the brainbox,
elephant's sneeze...

628
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,042
Sunset, a birds scream,
spit of the betel leaf.

629
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:02,375
Sunset, over the arse of an ass..

630
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,042
What a shame!
Father in love with daughter.

631
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:13,542
Bloody-bastard of a bicycle.

632
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,042
Forgive me, Gayatri.

633
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:20,042
As soon as they get
a wiff of the enemy..

634
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:22,167
..they move from
one place to another.

635
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:28,167
Then?

636
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:33,167
Then the demon asked the royal
physician for more wounds.

637
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:34,625
Then?

638
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,250
The royal physician had one daughter.

639
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,542
She told the demon, come
and heal my wound.'

640
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:43,042
None of the herbs from the jungle
could heal her slit.

641
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:46,042
When the demon leaned over
and looked closely...

642
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:48,250
..he was baffled and mistook her
arse-hole for another wound.

643
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,875
As soon as they get information
about the enemy..

644
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,750
..they hop from one place to another.

645
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,042
For these creatures
with binocular vision ..

646
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:03,417
..to jump from one place to another..

647
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:07,042
..they have to rely
purely on their sight.

648
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:09,625
As soon as they get information
about the enemy..

649
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,667
What are you doing?

650
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:41,750
I...? I'm remembering, repeating,
what I already read.

651
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,042
But what are you repeating?

652
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:44,250
Turn the page and look.

653
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:45,667
Move ahead.

654
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:47,958
Nose is coming in between.

655
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,500
- Nose? Nose is looking like what?
- Nose.

656
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,417
- Nose.
- Nose? What nose?

657
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,417
- What nose?
- Nose is blocking my vision.

658
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:57,875
Is it coming in between,
can't you see?

659
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:02,750
Gayatri! Gayatri!

660
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,292
Gayatri!

661
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:07,250
Just see what's wrong with
his sight.

662
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:08,875
The ball has jumped up my nose.

663
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,792
What happened?

664
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:12,667
When I study,
the nose grazes on my alphabets.

665
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:14,000
Read!

666
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:19,417
Olfactory glands
are chemical in nature.

667
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:22,292
The chemical sensations reach the

668
00:46:22,417 --> 00:46:26,667
olfactory receptors of the
brain passing through the nerves...

669
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:28,667
Did you see?

670
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:30,042
- Yes!
- What did you see?

671
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,292
Did it bleed?

672
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,958
- A pen full.
- To hell with this googly.

673
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:37,292
Phool!

674
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:45,542
Type,

675
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:50,792
To- prime minister..

676
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,625
Subject..

677
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,917
The googly.

678
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:07,375
Dear Raju..

679
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:13,792
Please ban..

680
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:22,625
..googly in cricket,
and life in general.

681
00:47:26,917 --> 00:47:27,958
Thanks.

682
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:37,000
A freedom fighter, Babuji B.
the caste-hybrid one.

683
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:13,292
Even James Bond was cured by
these shades.

684
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,625
Can you see?

685
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:24,042
This will keep your pupils framed.

686
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:29,042
Keep them next to your pillow
while sleeping.

687
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:38,875
Why did you hide from me that
my name was still in the roll call?

688
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,542
You yourself were hiding.

689
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,125
Till people could remember you...

690
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,167
...they were covering for your
absence.

691
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:45,417
If you yourself are fearful..

692
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:46,917
..why wouldn't the others
have fun at your expense?

693
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:48,542
Go enroll at the night college...

694
00:48:48,667 --> 00:48:50,875
... you can still appear in the exams
from there.

695
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:55,292
What's the use of
this cycle of yours?

696
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:57,167
Why? I am the icon of its company...

697
00:48:57,292 --> 00:48:58,667
...and they pay well?

698
00:48:58,792 --> 00:48:59,875
When do you sleep?

699
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:01,500
Why sleep when I never get tired?

700
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:03,125
But at some point you will get tired.

701
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,625
Only thinking tires you,
I never think.

702
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,750
- What about the cycle?

703
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:08,000
For every three pedals,
one pedal free!

704
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,292
What if the chains come off?

705
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:11,375
Stop there. Stay outside...

706
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,167
... my concentration is bound by the
circular field of my cycle.

707
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:16,417
If one Om is 17 years, then how
many Oms in one light year?

708
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:18,958
Out of course!

709
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:22,292
Fail or pass!

710
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:23,292
Fail or pass!

711
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:24,417
Fail or pass!

712
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:22,792
Om, your results are out.

713
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,250
What is your roll number?

714
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:25,667
I don't know.

715
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:27,542
- Where are you going?
- To get some air.

716
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:30,958
I've been watching
you from many days..

717
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:33,667
..why don't you ever
go inside the temple?

718
00:51:34,667 --> 00:51:35,750
I don't believe in it.

719
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:38,542
Don't believe in it? Then, why
do you come to the temple?

720
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:43,042
For it's music.

721
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:50,167
It is important for my dream to fail
for me to pass.

722
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:58,292
- Dream?
- I reach late to give exams.

723
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,292
As soon as I write the
ink evaporates.

724
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,417
I cant find answers
to any questions.

725
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:04,375
I forget what I had memorised.

726
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:06,417
My spectacles fall into the lake.

727
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,417
What are your subjects?

728
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:11,042
Science, Biology.

729
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:19,167
Silly boy, dreams are dreams,
they are not real?

730
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:22,417
Dreams always mean the contrary.

731
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:25,167
For the last 20 years a recurring
dream visits my sleep..

732
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:27,167
.. that my shoes have been
stolen from the temple.

733
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:29,167
I run away from home in fear.

734
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:32,292
... but in reality,
this has never happened.

735
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:35,917
Congratulations, Mr. Narlekar.

736
00:52:36,042 --> 00:52:39,792
Your son has defeated
Einstein, o yes!

737
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:42,417
Ajmer is proud of you.

738
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,167
Book-keeper sir,
the world war is coming near.

739
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,125
We need to prepare
for a sacrificial fire.

740
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,125
My life is kept in these shoes now.

741
00:52:57,167 --> 00:52:59,958
...go, take them and
offer them to Babuji to wear.

742
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:11,958
Lala, I swear by the urn that you
use, I will safe-gaurd these shoes...

743
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:13,750
..more than my soul.

744
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:17,125
Even at the cost of my life, I will
keep this promise.

745
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,042
No matter what, I will stop the war.

746
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:22,042
Ms. Silver will meet you at
the golf course.

747
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:26,542
She has the Nymph's address with her.

748
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:32,417
The code word is:
DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.'

749
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,167
Lala, even I've played
with marbles in childhood.

750
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:39,042
Be assured, I will stop the war.

751
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,542
Just keep in mind,
I might be robbed of my life.

752
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:57,875
"Small and big, all -tors
driven by mo-tors."

753
00:53:57,958 --> 00:54:01,375
"And all mo-tors powered by
Raju's mo-tor."

754
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:05,250
"Small and big, all beings
driven by mo-tors."

755
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,750
Shoot yourself and die
in real with this fake gun..

756
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:13,417
..or we'll tear your tongue out.

757
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:18,167
And those two, Angio and Gymnosperm,

758
00:54:18,292 --> 00:54:20,292
And those ten phylums
and five classes...

759
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:24,042
Who knows, maybe we are the matter
of their absconding minds.

760
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:26,250
Father, in contempt, challenged us...

761
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:29,292
..that all of us, his children
were his replica.

762
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:33,083
If one of us died prematurely,

763
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:36,375
the remaining age of the deceased
would add up to our father's life.

764
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:46,917
As if..

765
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:57,167
..we were some kind of black magic...

766
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:03,417
... as if, we children were born of
a dark spell cast upon our mother.

767
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:09,833
Gayatri, do you know why I have never
touched you till now?

768
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,917
Gayatri, do you know why
the plane flew?

769
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,375
Because Newton never
tasted that apple...

770
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,500
...and today in this world..

771
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,250
... there wouldn't be a trace..

772
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,250
..of an airport if he had a bite of that apple.

773
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:49,458
Darling...

774
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:51,583
You never asked for this before!

775
00:56:28,792 --> 00:56:30,292
Gayatri!

776
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:37,583
Gayatri!

777
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,417
Gayatri,
the waistband has got knotted!

778
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:49,292
Gayatri!

779
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:03,792
Gayatri!

780
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:05,375
Gayatri!

781
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:06,792
Gayatri!

782
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,833
Gayatri!

783
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:20,125
Gayatri!

784
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:36,708
I promise.

785
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:48,375
Gayatri, did you cut your hair short?

786
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,333
Shall I close the window?

787
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:52,583
No, turn off the radio.

788
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:13,250
The more non-violent I become...

789
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:19,375
...the more violent
this pistol will be.

790
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:26,417
This pistol does not need a
license to kill.

791
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:34,667
Who was that peace time pigeon
who flew and blew, blew!

792
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:49,167
Your code word is,
'B for Bakbak'[gibberish].

793
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,875
Dial 'M'[Yama] for Maya.

794
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,875
Mariyam for milk.

795
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:02,417
Here check. Check.

796
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:04,375
Mother tongue.

797
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:18,333
Phool!

798
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:20,708
Should I bring the tea, it is
time for the train.

799
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:22,750
I have rolled up your beddings.

800
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:25,792
Thief, where are my shoes?

801
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:27,417
I had put them safely last night.

802
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:29,250
Thief, give back my shoes.

803
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:30,917
I'm not a thief. I'm not a thief.

804
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:31,958
I'm not a thief.

805
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:33,083
I'm not a thief.

806
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:37,042
Gayatri, check her top to bottom.

807
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:38,667
Check her top to bottom.

808
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:40,458
Here check...

809
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:44,750
O madman, wake up, you are
still in your dream?

810
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,250
I didn't swallow your diamonds.

811
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,417
Your son, Om, he has
runaway with them.

812
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:51,375
Here! I dare you to step out! ...

813
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:52,625
... and if I were a liar,

814
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,583
I would die when I cross
this threshold, right here and now.

815
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:56,583
Gayatri!

816
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:04,750
Tell me your name?

817
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,292
Neither a name nor an alphabet
or a proverb.

818
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:10,333
Father was lost in the fair.

819
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:12,208
Even our book is kept there.

820
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:14,667
If I make offerings
then I could earn a name.

821
01:02:15,042 --> 01:02:16,333
Where are you coming from?

822
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:17,667
From the movies.

823
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,458
Show me the ticket.

824
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:24,167
- I lost it.
- Then tell me the story.

825
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:27,083
There was a boy who could hold his
breath for a long time.

826
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,250
Then one day his breath
turned into Helium.

827
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:32,042
- What is the heart of the paper?
- Crow.

828
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,083
... and the wings of the paper?

829
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:37,458
The cartridge keys, the cheat-notes
scribbled on half-pants...

830
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:40,750
What about Bohr?

831
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:43,292
He damned Eve in bangle-orbits.

832
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:47,625
- Keller?
- She could lip read the spirits.

833
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,042
She drew bucketsful of dark.

834
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:51,917
Out of course.

835
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:58,833
Keys of Morse's mind-code like
cuckoos crazed disco dance.

836
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:07,917
You still have one lakh balloon-full
of breath left in your account.

837
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:11,375
Dawn is breaking,
its time to leave...

838
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,792
... otherwise it was a pleasure
talking to you.

839
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:35,500
A little away there
was the same lake...

840
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:38,250
... but by then, the corpse had
left from there.

841
01:03:38,917 --> 01:03:41,667
Further away, there was a sign
that said "Park Here'.

842
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,625
I went and slept there.

843
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:46,875
When I woke up I found the
same coin of acumen

844
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:48,750
from my childhood
that I had lost long ago.

845
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:52,042
That trickster coin enticed me
to the pool of spirits.

846
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,917
It jumped into the water as
though beckoning me..

847
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,833
..'come and jump, there's
treasure down here'.

848
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:26,958
Who is it?

849
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:35,542
If your mouth is the lock, then the
key is set to my dream.

850
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:42,958
I'm a tourist. The advance is kept
under your pillow.

851
01:05:52,417 --> 01:05:57,000
Then you are our God.

852
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,792
- Good night.
- Good night.

853
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:51,167
The matter of the letter is,
spirit, money and water.

854
01:06:51,917 --> 01:06:54,625
This coin-pool is neither filled,
nor empty, or untrue.

855
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:58,083
As soon as the sun rises I'm
stepping into the treasure.

856
01:06:58,542 --> 01:07:00,750
You keep this coin pressed
in your jaw.

857
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:27,625
I understand everything, the matter
of your letter...

858
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:33,750
...I am not going to buy
your key-lock bluffs.

859
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:37,375
I had kept the coin clenched
in my teeth.

860
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:42,292
Scoundrel, why did it rain
counterfeit coins?

861
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:47,375
Remember, the Pushkar-police
is hunting for you.

862
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:49,917
So what if you are a God...

863
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:52,500
..the Pushkar-police
is still looking for you.

864
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:57,917
O wisdom tooth's idiot,
keep the head of the coin up.

865
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:00,042
The tail-end doesn't work.

866
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,250
Your mistake would've vaporized
me along with the treasure below.

867
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:14,792
Mr. Om.. Mr. Om, I agree that
you have powerful lungs.

868
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:19,083
But this coin is beyond
my understanding.

869
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:24,208
I cant serve you without this charm.

870
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,000
The sorcerer had told me to open
my fist and the coin had gone.

871
01:08:31,042 --> 01:08:32,292
I understand.

872
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:36,083
Mr. Om, the police is
looking for God.

873
01:08:36,708 --> 01:08:40,208
If you go out in the daytime there is
fear of getting caught,

874
01:08:40,958 --> 01:08:43,250
... at night, the fear of dogs.

875
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:44,917
... and I also know that..

876
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:48,000
..water draws money to it.

877
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,208
But partner, what is water?

878
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:52,208
- Ancestors'...
- ...and ancestors?

879
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:54,500
- Oilman...
- ... oil of what?

880
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:55,750
Mint.

881
01:08:55,917 --> 01:08:57,792
Whose mint is it, partner?

882
01:08:58,125 --> 01:09:00,833
Partner, all the money evaporated.

883
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,833
You pointlessly flipped
the coin over.

884
01:09:03,042 --> 01:09:04,625
What did you say?
I turned?

885
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,208
Its you who is a turncoat, thief!

886
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:07,833
You are the turncoat!

887
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,458
Go! Go inside the water again!

888
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:12,542
I'm telling you, go inside
the water again!

889
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:15,042
Go inside and get
me the treasure.

890
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:20,167
You think you can con me?

891
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:24,083
I can keep thousands
of divers like you.

892
01:09:24,542 --> 01:09:25,750
Go away!

893
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:29,667
See, all the taxes of 2000
years are banked here.

894
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:33,208
Yes. Just because I've
called you God..

895
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:34,958
...don't get bigheaded.

896
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,833
Go!

897
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:41,333
Om! Om!

898
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:45,583
Partner! Partner!

899
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:48,833
I didn't mean that, partner.

900
01:09:49,167 --> 01:09:50,833
I didn't mean that Om.

901
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,625
Om! Om!

902
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:54,792
Om!

903
01:09:57,042 --> 01:10:00,583
MISSING: Dear Om Return home. No one will ask
you anything. Your father BABUJI B. HYBRID.

904
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:24,833
Babuji, I agree that the whole world
has turned against you.

905
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,542
But what do I do?

906
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:30,167
You know that now you dare not...

907
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:33,083
step out of your room
as long as...

908
01:10:33,417 --> 01:10:35,083
... you are under
that witch's curse...

909
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:36,500
But now, I will
have to go.

910
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:38,667
I will go to Delhi
with the diamonds.

911
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:41,083
You know the elections
are coming near.

912
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:43,125
Where are the diamonds?

913
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,000
Seth, it is in your belly.

914
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:47,875
In my belly? How come?

915
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:50,000
Tell me.

916
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:53,667
Lala, you yourself had said
that diamonds are forever.

917
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:56,917
I ground the diamonds
and fed them to you.

918
01:10:57,417 --> 01:10:59,417
..the auspicious day of the Goddess of wealth will..

919
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:01,000
..fall on the full moon night.

920
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:03,458
... until then don't shit.

921
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,917
On that day, you will see the magic
when your shit lands..

922
01:11:06,042 --> 01:11:08,333
..the barren land will croak
with riches again.

923
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:11,875
... but no one should see
you while you are shitting...

924
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:12,875
.. if at all, somebody sees you,

925
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:14,667
then take care that he shouldn't
be able to see anyone...

926
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:16,708
... but, this doesn't mean you
have to kill him for that...

927
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:19,292
... and if you kill, then all your
austerities will come to nought.

928
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:59,875
Om, vote, fat
purgative note.

929
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:04,917
Om, vote, fat
purgative note.

930
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:13,042
Om, vote, fat
purgative note.

931
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:23,292
Om, vote, fat
purgative note.

932
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:30,917
Om, vote, fat
purgative note.

933
01:12:34,042 --> 01:12:38,167
Om, vote, fat
purgative note.

934
01:12:38,417 --> 01:12:41,167
Vampire, let me go!

935
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:45,792
Who? Who are you?

936
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:47,542
What are you doing here?

937
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:49,083
Don't you know me?

938
01:12:49,417 --> 01:12:51,125
I'm the Lala Lotamal.

939
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,042
I was catching frogs.

940
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:55,750
But without my permission?

941
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,375
- I am leaving.
- Wait.

942
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,458
You want my permission?

943
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:05,125
Whose son are you?

944
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:08,500
- Shankar..
- Shankar?

945
01:13:10,917 --> 01:13:13,917
- Did you hear anything?
- No.

946
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:17,333
- Did you see anything?
- No.

947
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:22,083
Then listen, will you do as
you are told?

948
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:23,042
Yes.

949
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:30,542
Then take note that until morning,
neither should anyone see you..

950
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:32,542
nor should you see anyone,

951
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:35,125
if you do this, from morning..

952
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,542
..you will have become
the contractor of my frog land.

953
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:05,917
Sir, there is a diamond
in my frog.

954
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:07,292
But the frog was mine.

955
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:09,083
Sir, there's a diamond
in my frog too.

956
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:11,083
Show me. Show me.

957
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,750
Why not, if a man can have
stone in his kidneys..

958
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:15,625
..then why can't a frog
have diamonds?

959
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,500
Sir, our college
will become famous now.

960
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:19,625
Sir, I know this boy, he catches
these frogs from Pushkar.

961
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:20,875
Sir, how do you say
metamorphosis in English..

962
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:23,167
- Akbar!
- He has gone to Iraq!

963
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:25,458
- To his aunt?
- Yes.

964
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:27,458
Even Amar had come to
meet him the other day.

965
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:29,750
- How are you?
- I'm good.

966
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,917
- Do you work?
- Yes.

967
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:34,375
- Where?
- In a zoo.

968
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,542
- In Ajmer?
- Everywhere.

969
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:38,917
- I have to be going.
- Okay.

970
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:40,167
I'll come again.

971
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:42,917
Here, she cast the spell
in this courtyard...

972
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
... that is her sandal she
left behind, and Om never returned.

973
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:57,833
Jump!

974
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:11,292
Hey Ram!

975
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:17,917
This is Lala Lotamal's
private shit-land.

976
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:22,000
Killing frogs is not allowed here.

977
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:26,292
The frogs here breed diamonds.

978
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:30,208
This is Lala Lotamal's land.

979
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:34,708
This is Lala Lotamal's
private shit-land.

980
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:36,708
Roast these scoundrels!

981
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:38,583
Book-keeper, this is all my produce.

982
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:40,292
This is my private produce.

983
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:42,917
Collector, I'm looted.

984
01:15:43,042 --> 01:15:46,000
SP I'm looted.
All my frogs are gone.

985
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,167
What will happen now?

986
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:51,125
Somebody stop these scoundrels...

987
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:54,292
... they have infested my land.
All my frogs are killed.

988
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:56,000
Leave it! Leave that frog!

989
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:59,250
O, the toy guns have
turned true.

990
01:16:32,958 --> 01:16:37,417
Bookkeeper, what does our
balance sheet show?

991
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:40,708
Lala, we have made a profit of 1
crore from the firecracker festival.

992
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:42,833
I've bought all the crackers.

993
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:45,583
The professor has verified them too.

994
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:48,375
Every bomb has atom hidden in it.

995
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,667
Babuji was great, he sacrificed
himself for the country.

996
01:16:52,792 --> 01:16:55,250
He offered his coconut-head
for the prosperity of our country.

997
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:57,917
He turned the firecracker
festival into a world war.

998
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,083
Dear Gayatri..

999
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,625
.. you can fill any amount you desire
in this blank cheque.

1000
01:17:41,292 --> 01:17:43,208
Where were you lost, Mr. Om?

1001
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:47,292
I have been waiting for you since
then, with this plate of offerings.

1002
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:50,792
Here, come out.

1003
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,458
Here, put on your goggles.

1004
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:57,083
Don't take little things
to your heart.

1005
01:17:57,833 --> 01:18:02,208
Nothing is impossible if devotee
and deity join hands together.

1006
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:08,667
Look,from tomorrow on the heavens
are landing at Pushkar.

1007
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:14,750
You do one thing, everyday at
12 midnight, emerge from...

1008
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:17,875
... the water, and give
audience to the public.

1009
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:23,375
Look, we shall become as rich as
the richest men in the world. Yes.

1010
01:18:23,667 --> 01:18:28,333
Welcome to the Gods, Mr. Om.
Welcome to the Gods.

1011
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:43,292
Thank you.

1012
01:18:43,917 --> 01:18:45,917
The heavens have
landed at earth.

1013
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:47,917
For the benefit of the devotees..

1014
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:50,958
..of all cast and creed,
heavenly Pushkar stays here

1015
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:55,375
for the next five days and nights.

1016
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:56,625
On this occasion,

1017
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:58,917
whoever prays and makes
offerings here,...

1018
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,333
...their wishes are fulfilled.

1019
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:02,625
You can get a list of inns
and food stalls..

1020
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:05,167
..from the information center.

1021
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:07,042
Keeping in mind the
comforts of the pilgrims...

1022
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:13,042
..Pushkar has opened many more
food stalls.

1023
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:15,208
On the behalf of Pushkar Waterworks,

1024
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,042
bottled and sealed
holy-water of Pushkar

1025
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:19,917
is being given free
to the pilgrims.

1026
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:21,083
Thank you.

1027
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:49,125

everything for Rs. 100.

1042
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:41,125
Take anything,
everything for Rs. 100.

1043
01:21:42,542 --> 01:21:43,833
PROMISE.

1044
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:51,292
Before the oblation is distributed
amongst the devotees..

1045
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:55,708
..I would like to discourse on this miracle..

1046
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:58,583
..with the name of Lord Gurudev.

1047
01:22:00,042 --> 01:22:00,792
Om..

1048
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:17,083
Gurudev, in this era of consumerism,
what message of...

1049
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:20,250
spiritual fulfillment
does this paste of teeth offer...

1050
01:22:20,542 --> 01:22:23,042
What business of faith
this 'PROMISE' offer?

1051
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,917
Why does this divine boy
stand holding his breath?

1052
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:28,042
Sir, what is he
pointing towards?

1053
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:36,125
Non co-operation
movement of BREATH.

1054
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:38,000
Non co-operation
movement of BREATH.

1055
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:40,958
Why did Brahma break his promise?

1056
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:43,542
The ideal welfare empire of Rama!

1057
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:45,458
Pushkar in each and every bit.

1058
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:49,833
The welfare empire of Rama!

1059
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:02,542
Fish-key-chain.

1060
01:23:02,667 --> 01:23:04,000
Fish-key-chain.

1061
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:05,417
Fish-key-chain.

1062
01:23:05,542 --> 01:23:06,875
Fish-key-chain.

1063
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,417
Fish-key-chain.

1064
01:23:08,625 --> 01:23:09,750
Fish-key-chain.

1065
01:23:09,875 --> 01:23:11,125
Fish-key-chain.

1066
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:12,167
Fish-key-chain.

1067
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:14,667
O fuck! I had asked for
the welfare of all, hey Ram!

1068
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:17,417
Family planning is not
a witch's dream..

1069
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:19,208
..that ferric fishes would
surface from water.

1070
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:21,833
But you had promised that
he will fish out a rainbow.

1071
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,917
You have failed Mr. Coca-cola.

1072
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:26,125
The watch has slipped
off your hand.

1073
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:28,375
A metal fish is no
answer to either...

1074
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,667
... protest or contraceptive.

1075
01:23:29,792 --> 01:23:32,000
Return the contract
amount.

1076
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:40,542
And after that, after working
at the Pool-of-spirits...

1077
01:23:40,667 --> 01:23:43,292
..I started supplying frogs
from frog-land of Lotamal.

1078
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:44,500
Then one day..

1079
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:46,042
..a rumor spread
all over Ajmer..

1080
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:48,625
..that the frogs of frog-land have
diamonds in their belly.

1081
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:49,792
This happened at the same time..

1082
01:23:49,917 --> 01:23:51,708
..when the fire-crackers
had turned deadly real.

1083
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,333
People had vandalized all
the firecracker shops.

1084
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:56,708
... and then the doors of frog land
were shut even for me.

1085
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,792
So I had to return
to Pool-of-spirits.

1086
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,958
and now I'm the hero..

1087
01:24:00,083 --> 01:24:02,667
..of the Pushkar Kaya Watch
advertisements films.

1088
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:06,167
The idea of 'Non co-operation
movement of BREATH' was inspired by me.

1089
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,625
But what does it say
in your contract, Om?

1090
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:10,292
I get whatever I demand.

1091
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:12,125
But your nature is strange, Om...

1092
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:15,167
when you hold your breath you are
working, you are co-operating,...

1093
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:17,792
... so breathing for you would
be your non-coperation.

1094
01:24:18,167 --> 01:24:20,958
So when everyone stands holding
their breath, non co-operating..

1095
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:23,208
...you will have to breathe, for your
non co-operation, Om.

1096
01:24:23,417 --> 01:24:25,167
And as soon as you
breathe under water..

1097
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:27,208
..your dead body will surface
floating on the water.

1098
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:28,292
Exactly at that moment..

1099
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:30,375
..the death dance of this
death watch will begin.

1100
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:31,958
This is your murder plan, Om.

1101
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:33,667
You are jealous.

1102
01:24:37,292 --> 01:24:40,458
You had asked me when
my chain came off?

1103
01:24:40,792 --> 01:24:42,875
Look at this, Vishnu's
turn of the aeons.

1104
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,792
Lalaji, the diamonds are
sprinkled all over.

1105
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:14,833
My endeavors were fruitful.

1106
01:25:15,042 --> 01:25:16,917
Now we will have to go to China..

1107
01:25:17,167 --> 01:25:18,583
..and then to
lake of consciousness [Mansarovar].

1108
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:21,917
But Babuji, we haven't opened
up a single frog.

1109
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,208
It shouldn't be such
that the story of..

1110
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:24,667
..frogs and diamonds
turn out to be fake.

1111
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:28,167
You can't verify the reality
of diamonds without savoring it.

1112
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:31,667
So take this. Taste it. Taste it.

1113
01:25:32,042 --> 01:25:33,958
Your wish is my command.

1114
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:15,042
And look, the grave-keeper,
my Godfather.

1115
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:22,708
Father!

1116
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:34,625
Lala's soul was in marbles
and father's lived in the chameleon.

1117
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:37,000
Since all the secrets of
frog land were with him...

1118
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,417
...without performing
father's last rites,

1119
01:26:38,542 --> 01:26:40,042
we could neither find Phoenix
nor our book of genesis...

1120
01:26:40,167 --> 01:26:41,917
...for this, it was essential
to buy back that goatskin water bag,

1121
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,750
from the ghost brigade, at any cost.

1122
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,208
There is only one way for
you to evade this murder plan, Om...

1123
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:01,333
..you have to make an offering,

1124
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:03,208
of plaster of Paris equal
to your weight, to Pushkar.

1125
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:05,458
Even I have the key
to Pushkar, Atlas.

1126
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:07,000
- What?
- Fish.

1127
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:13,375
Exactly.. 5 minutes to 12..

1128
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:16,208
..the bagpipe will start playing.

1129
01:27:17,292 --> 01:27:18,375
Exactly at 12..

1130
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,958
...breaths will be inhaled.

1131
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:23,708
With the appearance of Om...

1132
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,333
..the 'Non co-operation
movement of BREATH'..

1133
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:28,333
..against the big breath
of Brahma will begin.

1134
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:30,500
Greetings, sir. Good evening, sir

1135
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,667
Are you also going to hold
your breathe, sir?

1136
01:27:32,792 --> 01:27:35,208
Hello? Hello, operator?

1137
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:38,208
Hello? Are you holding
your breath, sir?

1138
01:27:38,542 --> 01:27:41,125
The whole nation is holding
its breath, sir, the whole nation!

1139
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:43,458
Sir, breath.

1140
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,792
Breathe! Hello? Hello?

1141
01:27:46,917 --> 01:27:47,917
Yes, sir.

1142
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:50,167
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1143
01:27:50,292 --> 01:27:51,417
You are right, sir.

1144
01:27:51,542 --> 01:27:53,042
You are exactly right, sir.

1145
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:54,458
What, sir?

1146
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,792
Are Government officials not allowed
to hold their breath, sir?

1147
01:27:57,917 --> 01:27:59,500
But why, sir?

1148
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:01,958
The government officials should..

1149
01:28:02,083 --> 01:28:04,667
..also have the right
to hold their breath, sir.

1150
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,042
Yes, sir.
I will definitely protest, sir.

1151
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:11,250
Protest, sir! Protest!

1152
01:28:11,875 --> 01:28:15,167
Yes sir.
I will definitely protest, sir.

1153
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:19,208
Hello. Yes sir, he is
standing right here.

1154
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:20,417
He is standing right here.

1155
01:28:20,542 --> 01:28:21,875
Talk to him, sir.

1156
01:28:22,042 --> 01:28:26,083
Yes, sir. Birth control
is equal to breath control, sir.

1157
01:28:26,208 --> 01:28:27,750
You are exactly right, sir.

1158
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:29,542
Yes sir, please talk to him, sir.

1159
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:31,375
Hello.

1160
01:28:31,542 --> 01:28:32,875
Hello. Good evening, sir.

1161
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:37,042
Yes. The cure for the
collective discontent...

1162
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:41,000
Pranayam as protest,
three minutes every morning.

1163
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:44,833
Pranayam as protest, sir.

1164
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:50,042
'Non Co-operation movement
of BREATH'

1165
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:53,167
'Non-co-operative movement.'

1166
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:55,000
Yes, sir.

1167
01:28:55,292 --> 01:28:57,917
A man can't live by his breath alone.

1168
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:02,417
Sir.. are you speaking
from Pool-of-spirits?

1169
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,250
Hello? Hello?

1170
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:07,250
Hello?

1171
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:10,125
The banks are decaying,
fishes are dying.

1172
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:38,917
Everything for sale, just for 100 Rs.

1173
01:29:41,708 --> 01:29:44,875
Sir.. sir, misguided by some

1174
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
anti-social elements..

1175
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:48,333
big fishe have stopped eating
small fishe, sir.

1176
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:49,500
The fish are dying,
the banks are stinking.

1177
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:50,917
Everything for sale, only 100 Rs.

1178
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,958
Is that so...

1179
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:53,833
... every 'if' has a 'but'.

1180
01:29:53,917 --> 01:29:55,542
the croco-dial has been
released into the pond.

1181
01:29:55,667 --> 01:29:57,500
Go and turn on the light.

1182
01:30:02,583 --> 01:30:03,500
Lights.

1183
01:30:08,417 --> 01:30:11,250
If we don't buy, how will they sell?

1184
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:13,500
'Non Co-operation movement
of BREATH'

1185
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:16,375
If we don't buy, how will they sell?

1186
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:17,792
We demand that..

1187
01:30:17,917 --> 01:30:20,083
..heaven should stay back in
Pushkar throughout the year.

1188
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:22,333
We demand that heaven should stay
back in Pushkar throughout the year.

1189
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,917
Madam, master has sent for you.

1190
01:30:25,042 --> 01:30:27,208
Why did Lord Brahma
break his promise?

1191
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:31,417
We will getaway to a space
where the living are free of breaths.

1192
01:30:31,542 --> 01:30:33,500
Pushkar in every being,

1193
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:35,500
... and a generator
to each village.

1194
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,292
Pushkar in everything.

1195
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:39,292
... and a generator
to each village.

1196
01:31:19,292 --> 01:31:21,458
The coconut cracked breaking
the TV in its sleep.

1197
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:24,375
A rib of the daylight,
the girl vanished,

1198
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,792
...lost in the lungs.

1199
01:31:25,917 --> 01:31:28,042
Dived, drowned,
in the Pool-of-spirits: the mermaid.

1200
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,625
Every night at 12 I used to
appear from the water..

1201
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:43,125
.. of the Pool-of-spirits
and give audience to my devotees.

1202
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:46,708
I was the lead in the ad film
for Pushkar Kaya Watch.

1203
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:49,625
My breath changed to helium,
I don't remember when, anymore.

1204
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:52,458
But the postmortem report
showed that I died of..

1205
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:54,292
.. a rupture of the lungs.

1206
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:58,000
This much I remember, I was crossing
the desert with the chameleon.

1207
01:31:58,167 --> 01:32:00,625
... and then, I stared at
the sun, and sneezed.

1208
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:13,792
Before I could tell him...

1209
01:33:14,292 --> 01:33:16,917
...the tonga-driver brought
me straight here.

1210
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:21,042
By the way, I don't rent out
to acquaintances.

1211
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:24,500
But since you've come from far,
you may come inside.

1212
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:46,042
There is a vacant bed inside.

1213
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:51,417
Lock the door from inside.

1214
01:34:11,792 --> 01:34:12,958
Gayatri!

1215
01:34:13,542 --> 01:34:14,958
Gayatri, open the door!

1216
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:18,333
I want to ask you something.

1217
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:20,917
When my name was coming
from Dubai in the request show,

1218
01:34:21,042 --> 01:34:22,167
were you listening?

1219
01:34:22,458 --> 01:34:23,500
Get out.

1220
01:34:23,792 --> 01:34:24,625
Get out.

1221
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:25,958
Get out from here.

1222
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:29,667
Who.. who is that baby?

1223
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:33,708
Just a paying guest...

1224
01:34:34,417 --> 01:34:35,583
... do you mind?

1225
01:34:50,042 --> 01:34:52,458
There are only three space-stations
in the world, Gayatri,

1226
01:34:52,917 --> 01:34:55,000
...first in America, NASA...

1227
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:57,625
...nearest to the moon.

1228
01:34:58,167 --> 01:35:00,625
... and the other one in Russia.

1229
01:35:01,125 --> 01:35:02,750
... from where Mr. Shastri flew.

1230
01:35:03,542 --> 01:35:04,708
And third..

1231
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:07,458
... the divine AIR-port of Pushkar..

1232
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:10,083
..from where you
and I will take flight.

1233
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:30,208
Hail! OM NAMOH NARAYANA!

1234
01:35:35,583 --> 01:35:37,000
Let me taste it first, Gayatri...

1235
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:39,167
...you know how bad my spelling is.

1236
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:53,083
Bullshit.
The taste of KCN [potassium cyanide].
