00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
TeamExDR

2
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,125
Rakesh Suri, very good.

3
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,250
92%.

4
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,583
Shankar Prakash, 95%.

5
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,166
Umesh Bhairav.

6
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:44,291
Excellent. 97%.

7
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,458
And finally we'll hear Student
of the Year's marks...

8
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,791
who failed for just two numbers.

9
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:55,916
Shrinath Prasad...

10
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,916
Whenever its result time...

11
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,125
he always runs off to the bathroom.

12
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,208
But... - Sir.

13
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:07,375
Bhai says, "Do me a favor that,
don't ever do me any favor".

14
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,291
But I say do me a favor.

15
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,041
Please give me two more marks, sir.

16
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,416
Shankar and Loy have done me a favor.

17
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,208
By making me proud.

18
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,125
Shankar's going to join IPS.

19
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,041
Loy will join IAS. - Thank you sir.

20
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,208
And Roshan is going to IIM.

21
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,629
Sir, I am going to IPL.

22
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,500
You're not going anywhere.

23
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,201
You're going to stay right
here with me, in this class.

24
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,902
Because your antics, dog's tail...

25
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,541
and Katrina's Hindi
can never straighten up.

26
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,458
Sir, these days she speaks better Hindi.

27
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,333
Get out of my class. - What, sir?

28
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,250
I said get out of my class.

29
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,833
Sir, I...

30
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,173
That's my paper, sir.

31
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,291
First you fail me and then forget.

32
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:51,291
Go ahead.

33
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,541
Tripathi, there can't be a
better auspicious occasion...

34
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,602
for your daughter's marriage. - Yes.

35
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,333
Even God can't stop this marriage. - Yes.

36
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,333
Excuse me.

37
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,166
Sir, come here.

38
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,166
Excuse me.

39
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,583
Come here.

40
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,208
Come, Come..

41
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,069
Why are you whispering in my ears?

42
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,375
You don't need to hide
this from the people.

43
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,375
Shinu abducted my daughter!

44
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,416
Don't take it personally.

45
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,470
But your father Tripathi will never change.

46
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,506
For just two marks...

47
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:35,250
he didn't just sc***
my future, but yours too.

48
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,208
Bappa!

49
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,333
Just like You wanted, I
abducted Tripathi's daughter.

50
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,083
Will he pass me now?

51
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,291
Bow to Him!

52
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,791
I never said this.

53
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,583
Look, Shinu, don't make
me your partner in crime.

54
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,833
You know there are just three
things in life I love.

55
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,053
What? - On television, Amit sir's Crorepati

56
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,083
In Tennis, Mahesh Bhupati.

57
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,333
And in Gods, my dear Lord Ganpati.

58
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:01,416
Thank you.

59
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:02,791
People butter me...

60
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,331
but you always fool me.

61
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,041
No Bappa. - Shinu!

62
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,821
Bye Bappa, I'll catch you later.

63
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,625
Okay bye see you take care.

64
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,625
I hope no God ever gets a
useless devotee like you.

65
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:24,375
Hey come here.

66
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:25,416
Shinu.

67
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,250
Son. Let my daughter go.

68
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,333
Tripathi sir, just give me two more marks.

69
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:36,666
As soon as I pass, she'll be with her papa.

70
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,125
Tripathi, sir.

71
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,125
Prasad.

72
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,973
Prasad, your son kidnapped my daughter...

73
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,000
from her wedding.

74
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,621
I see, very good. - Come on.

75
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,116
Prasad, my daughter. - Oh yes.

76
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,291
What did you eat when he was in your womb?

77
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,541
Whatever it was, you fed it to me.

78
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,375
Shinu, open the door.

79
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,458
My son, open the door.

80
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,718
My son... He won't listen
so affectionately.

81
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:55,666
Hold this.

82
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,416
Shinu, open the door, son...

83
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,458
otherwise I'll abdicate
you from my will.

84
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,666
Now you learnt your lesson. - Relax.

85
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,208
My daughter. - Wait, wait, wait.

86
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,208
Wait.

87
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,625
This is my glasses.

88
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,708
My daughter.

89
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,083
Sorry, dear. - Dad.

90
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:16,083
Sorry, dear. - Dad.

91
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,250
Sir, sir.

92
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,666
Sir come, come, come.

93
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:25,958
You don't need to hide
this from everyone...

94
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:26,875
and whisper it in my ears.

95
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,958
The groom's family ran away.

96
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,333
Who will marry my daughter now?

97
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,793
Tell Shinu to marry her.

98
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,916
Tell Shinu to marry her!

99
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,583
Shinu.

100
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:38,583
Marry her.

101
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,553
No. - Well, you had to get married one day.

102
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,108
And she's the professor's daughter.

103
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,541
He'll pass you next year.

104
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,333
Yes.

105
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,666
Take him away. - Go on.

106
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:46,916
Dad.

107
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,666
'She's so fat, if she stands
on the weighing scale...'

108
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,125
'...it will only show 'To Be Continued'.

109
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,250
Srinath Prasad, you're not so unlucky.

110
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,791
I am not so unlucky...

111
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:03,125
that I've to marry this duffer, papa.

112
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,250
Come on, son.

113
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,030
Eat your dinner, it'll get cold.

114
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,125
Not fair, mom.

115
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,291
I did so well in my exams.

116
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,791
I wrote three page long
answers for every question.

117
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,416
But still Tripathi failed me.

118
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,291
I am sure your answers must be right.

119
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,352
But his questions must be wrong. - Yes.

120
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,333
Yes.

121
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,873
Pass me that bread. - Yes.

122
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,916
You know Verma's son...

123
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,333
went to Bangalore to
complete his studies.

124
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,000
And Shinde's son went to Pune.

125
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,583
We're so fortunate.

126
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,291
Our son doesn't leave us and go anywhere.

127
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,872
And day before yesterday...

128
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,458
our servant left the job
to complete his degree.

129
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,458
Here, son.

130
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,541
From tomorrow morning be at the shop.

131
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,291
I will not come to the shop.

132
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,083
I will go to Bangalore.

133
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,916
And get a degree there.

134
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,125
Degree? - Degree?

135
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,333
Bengaluru isn't that way, son.
It's this way.

136
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,625
I am going to the toilet.

137
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,458
He won't get a degree...

138
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,458
instead he'll give us third degree.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,375
Mama, pa, see my popularity.

140
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,166
The entire city's here to bid goodbye.

141
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,666
Son, goodbyes are given with just one hand.

142
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,666
Take a closer look.

143
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,125
They're waving both their hands.
That means don't come back.

144
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,125
They're feeling so good in saying bye.

145
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,123
Now that you're leaving...

146
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,885
don't return until
you achieve something.

147
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,416
Go on.

148
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:02,291
Eat on time.

149
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,208
"Come to me."

150
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,083
"Come to me."

151
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,083
Here I am.

152
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,291
Hi. Hi. Hi.

153
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,152
Girls, this is my seat... - Hello.

154
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,041
Don't try to get too friendly.

155
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,958
Go and sit on your seat.

156
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,541
Excuse me, this is my seat.

157
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,083
Uncle - Tell me son..

158
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,041
I am joining the IPS for such hoodlums.

159
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,666
I'll get rid of them...

160
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,007
and protect Mother
India and her daughters.

161
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,666
Excuse me, wherever we sit
that seat belongs to us.

162
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,886
Yes, but... - So please sit somewhere else.

163
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,291
Listen... - U-turn.

164
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,083
Go.

165
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,125
Am I your touch-screen phone...

166
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:50,125
that you're constantly touching me.

167
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,125
Sorry.

168
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,583
Come on, girls.

169
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,875
How about you play a round with us too?

170
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,375
But it's important to
drink before you sing.

171
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,500
They were getting Ranbir Kapoor...

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,458
but I guess they're
destined for Shakti Kapoor.

173
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,541
Baby, have some.

174
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:14,708
Weren't you going to kill me...

175
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,208
and protect the daughters of India.

176
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,208
Don't look now, but goons
are misbehaving with girls.

177
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,789
Go on, what's stopping you?

178
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:21,875
Hey, hero.

179
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:26,250
I was waiting for that
dialogue to beat you up.

180
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,270
Uncle, will you please hold my jacket.

181
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,250
Tell him about me.

182
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,291
Do you know who Babu is?

183
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,750
Who Babu's father is.

184
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,750
Who Babu's brother...
- I'm going to beat up your Babu...

185
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,750
that he'll never beget a baba or a baby.

186
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,541
"I am bad."

187
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,541
Should I hit you on the face or the chest?

188
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,541
Hit you on the face... - Hit hard.

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,500
"I am bad."

190
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,958
You'll have to pay for it dearly.
- That's okay.

191
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,958
I hate cheap things anyway.

192
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,583
Out!

193
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,583
Out!

194
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:38,083
Out!

195
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,543
Go. - Thank you so much.

196
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:40,458
It's okay.

197
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,125
This was...

198
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,000
Can I have my seat now?

199
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,958
I'll get my jacket.

200
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,958
Uncle.

201
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,958
Shinu, my brother.

202
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,791
Even Dennis is not such a
menace compared to you.

203
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,666
I remember, it was a Saturday...

204
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,041
when you entered my life as bad luck.

205
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,750
I came to Bangalore from
Ooty only to escape you.

206
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,708
But I pray every day.

207
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,416
Send beggars to my house.

208
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,625
Send illness in my body.

209
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,583
But never you.

210
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:22,583
I guess that's a beggar.

211
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:31,997
Aren't you happy to see me?

212
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:32,765
I am very happy.

213
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,408
I was just thinking about you.

214
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,583
I swear. - Very good.

215
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,416
I took admission in your college.

216
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:38,750
And do you know what the good news is?
- What?

217
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,041
I'll be living in your house with you.

218
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,461
But bro, you'll be living
for a few days, right?

219
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,000
Are you crazy? Few days?

220
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
I'm here to get a degree.

221
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,208
I can't leave until I don't pass.

222
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,166
That means you'll never leave.

223
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,333
Right now I'll go take a bath.
- What are you doing?

224
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,754
Let go of my underwear.

225
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,886
Where's the bathroom? - Straight and right.

226
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,708
I hope it's clean. - Yes.

227
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,000
From today even kids will say...

228
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,000
"Mom, I want to study in
the same college as Shinu".

229
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh no, he's seen me.

230
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,916
Lord Krishna, here.

231
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,291
So, You followed me to Bangalore as well.

232
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:32,333
I am God.

233
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,208
From Powai to Hawaii,
you'll find me everywhere.

234
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,583
You know I love only three songs.

235
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,833
Raj Kapoor's "Rammaiyya Vastavaiyya".

236
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,458
Bappi Da's "Ta Thaiyya-thiayya". - I see.

237
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:48,000
"Bada Nathkhat hai Yeh Kishan Kanhaiyya."
- That's my song.

238
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,833
You forgot, I am the
original butter stealer.

239
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,333
Don't try to butter me.

240
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,416
God, I've decided. - What?

241
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,208
This time I will concentrate on my studies.
- Good.

242
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,666
And help me score at least 90%... - 90%!

243
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,166
Fine, at least get me pass marks.

244
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,867
And keep me away from every
attraction and distraction.

245
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:04,583
Okay.

246
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,416
I mean... girls. - I'll try.

247
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,916
Shinu look at her.

248
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,916
She's not bad.

249
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,458
Lord, I came here to get a degree...

250
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,291
but You sent me after
girls, just like You.

251
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,871
But the problem is, when You
do it it's Divine play.

252
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,833
But if I do it, I'm a Casanova.

253
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,041
OMG.

254
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,291
You blessed me by dropping this flower.

255
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:03,375
Too much.

256
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,333
'Duffer, the breeze was strong...'

257
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,791
'...that's why the flower fell down.'

258
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:08,875
Where is she?

259
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,208
Where is she?

260
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:14,208
Where is she?

261
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,291
Hey, my name is Shinu.

262
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:19,831
Full name, Srinath Prasad.

263
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,968
Actually, this is a new
college, new city...

264
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,208
so when I saw you, I felt
I should make new friends.

265
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,958
If you don't mind, can you
show me around your campus?

266
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,666
I can show you... my campus. - Nice try.

267
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,625
But it's much more fun if
she shows me, not you.

268
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:39,208
Nice try, but she isn't interested
in showing anyone anything.

269
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,208
Come on.

270
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,670
Why does your jealous
friend always interfere...

271
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,541
whenever I try to talk to you?

272
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,541
Oh...

273
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,750
Barfi...

274
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,583
The boy's crazy, but he's cute.

275
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:09,583
Turn around!

276
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:10,583
Turn around!

277
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:14,458
Turn around!

278
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,281
Bro, what are you doing? - Why?

279
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,416
Do you know who you're flirting with?

280
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,208
You're my friend, aren't you?

281
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,108
So she's your future sister-in-law.

282
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,541
There are 200 girls in this college. - Yes.

283
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,416
And you had to like her.

284
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,916
Sunaina's the entire
college's sister-in-law.

285
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,208
Just think... Brad and Angelina.

286
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,583
Brangilina.

287
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,250
Sunaina and Shinu.

288
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,750
Sunainu.

289
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,208
Sunainu!

290
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,458
Stop dreaming.

291
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,541
She's Angad Negi's future wife.

292
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:52,875
Who is Angad Negi?

293
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:58,583
Anger is one of the most
destructive emotions.

294
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,583
Especially in a relationship.

295
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:09,125
A cat scratches in a fit of rage.

296
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,375
A donkey kicks.

297
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,708
Angad's a kind of an animal.

298
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:20,000
In fact, he even looks like one.

299
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,220
What do you think?

300
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,875
What animal does Angad look like?

301
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,541
I feel like Angad looks like a scavenger.

302
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,916
I feel Angad looks like a stray dog.

303
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,916
He does everything openly.

304
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,006
What happened, Angad?

305
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,458
Aren't you feeling angry today?

306
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,166
No doctor, I am miles away from anger.

307
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:58,708
Are you sure?

308
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:03,916
Doctor if I was angry, you wouldn't
be alive to ask the next question.

309
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,291
Good control, Angad.

310
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,311
Good control.

311
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,416
Excellent. - Thank you.

312
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,000
Angad, today's your last class...

313
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,750
so before you go, just want
to ask you few questions.

314
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,750
Do you still love Sunaina? - Knock-knock.

315
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,625
Knock-knock.

316
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,541
Who is it? - Sunaina.

317
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:36,875
Sunaina who? - I don't know either.

318
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,833
Brilliant. Brilliant.

319
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,458
See... this is how you deal with it.

320
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:44,916
I am so proud of you.

321
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,875
You can be Angad too.

322
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,583
See just look at him.

323
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,708
Your friendship cost me dearly too.

324
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:57,541
No boy ever flirts or talks to me.

325
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:58,541
Sorry.

326
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,333
Hi. - Bye.

327
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:10,375
Beat it..beat it..just beat it..

328
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,500
Hi, I am Hari. I am a new student.

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,416
If you don't mind, can I sit here?

330
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:17,416
Mom!

331
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,166
What are you doing, Angad?

332
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,947
If you keep doing this, it
will only spoil your relation.

333
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,875
Sister-in-law.

334
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,208
Look, Sunaina, don't be scared.

335
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,666
I am trying to be a better person.

336
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,375
For your sake I even attended
anger management classes.

337
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,125
But, just like in chess...

338
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,585
if the pawns get a
chance to meet the queen...

339
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,500
then it only ruins the
game, sister-in-law.

340
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,708
"Just beat it."

341
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,708
"Beat it."

342
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,916
Knock-knock!

343
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,041
Knock-knock! - Who is it?

344
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,791
Who is it?

345
00:20:59,291 --> 00:20:59,791
AG.

346
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,458
Who is AG?

347
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,083
Who is AG?

348
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,916
Hear me clearly.

349
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,916
If anyone sits with Sunaina,
he's gone for good.

350
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,688
Bro, why are you looking so confused?

351
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,250
Just sit anywhere.

352
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,666
After today, I won't even
sit at my dining table.

353
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,046
What's wrong with him?

354
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,083
From Drunk driving to vandalism...

355
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,291
Angad saved you from every case.

356
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,583
And in return, all he asked for...

357
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:38,125
was to keep an eye on
sister-in-law Sunaina.

358
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,125
Take off your glasses.

359
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,416
After today no boy should befriend Sunaina.

360
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,458
The line's clich? but the emotion's real.

361
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,519
Do you want to make friendship with me?

362
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,250
Class, canteen or library...

363
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,500
no boy should be sitting with her.

364
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,680
I want to study with you in the classroom.

365
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,166
Eat with you in the canteen.

366
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,250
And peek in your books in the library.

367
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,990
Spread so much terror around...

368
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,916
that no one dares to
press the send button...

369
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,875
to send a message to Sunaina.

370
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,958
I want to text you, mail
you, Tweet you, Skype you.

371
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:14,083
And if you still don't
reply, I'll poke you.

372
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,791
On Facebook.

373
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,750
Brother Angad come fast.

374
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,291
Hey, mom.

375
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:24,751
Pardon me, but I forgot.

376
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,833
My mother sent this for you, from Meerut.

377
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,333
Just arrived from Agra.

378
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,958
Their traditional dress.

379
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,858
I don't know about a degree, mom...

380
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,750
but I will certainly bring back a girl.

381
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,750
Bye.

382
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,458
I've told my mother about you.

383
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,541
I swear on my mother's beans...

384
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,250
I will win your heart in Bangalore...

385
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,666
we'll get married in Ooty...

386
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,458
and honeymoon in Goa.

387
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,291
He's quite low-budget. - Shut up.

388
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,458
You scare me more than Angad.

389
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:02,666
Let's go, Esha.

390
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,666
Sunaina, we can even go to Australia.

391
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:06,750
New Zealand.

392
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,333
Kenya. No, that isn't nice.

393
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:12,333
Wherever you want to go.

394
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,458
"Since I saw you I am completely shaken."

395
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:46,458
"Feels like my heart jumped out."

396
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:53,875
"Since I saw you I am completely shaken."

397
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,750
"Feels like my heart jumped out."

398
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,250
"I'll take you to see my mom and dad."

399
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,458
"Everything I say you think is wrong."

400
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:08,750
"Turn around."

401
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,625
"Where are you looking?"

402
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,541
"Your hero's right here."

403
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,333
"Where are you looking?"

404
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,208
"Your hero's right here."

405
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,000
"Where are you looking?"

406
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,250
"Your hero's right here."

407
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,708
"Turn around."

408
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,541
"Do you know?"

409
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,416
"Your hero's right here."

410
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,208
"Where are you looking?"

411
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,125
"Your hero's right here."

412
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:30,958
"Where are you looking?"

413
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:34,958
"Your hero's right here."

414
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:51,833
"Come I'll take you out for a coffee."

415
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:57,791
"Come I'll take you for a movie."

416
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:05,125
"I'll take you to a place, sweetheart..."

417
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:08,875
"Where we'll be scared of no one."

418
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,791
"Where no one can cast an eye on us."

419
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:16,791
"Everything I say you think is wrong."

420
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:19,916
"Turn around."

421
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:21,708
"Where are you looking?"

422
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,708
"Your hero's right here."

423
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,541
"Where are you looking?"

424
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,416
"Your hero's right here."

425
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,208
"Where are you looking?"

426
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,416
"Your hero's right here."

427
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:32,916
"Turn around."

428
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:34,791
"Do you know?"

429
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,666
"Your hero's right here."

430
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,416
"Where are you looking?"

431
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:42,416
"Your hero's right here."

432
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:52,291
"Why does the world say to me?"

433
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:58,416
"It's not easy to get you."

434
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:03,666
"I'll endure your attitude."

435
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:09,375
"I swear on you... I'll hang
the moon outside your window."

436
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:13,375
"I can hang my heart...
outside your dress."

437
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:17,250
"Everything I say you think is wrong."

438
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,833
"Turn around."

439
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:20,458
"Where are you looking?"

440
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:22,458
"Your hero's right here."

441
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,250
"Where are you looking?"

442
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,208
"Your hero's right here."

443
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:28,000
"Where are you looking?"

444
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,208
"Your hero's right here."

445
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:31,666
"So turn around."

446
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:33,541
"Do you know?"

447
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,375
"Your hero's right here."

448
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,250
"Where are you looking?"

449
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,125
"Your hero's right here."

450
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:40,916
"Where are you looking?"

451
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:44,916
"Your hero's right here."

452
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,458
Shinu stop.

453
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,438
What happened. - Where are you going?

454
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,218
Angad Negi's boys are looking for you.
- Me?

455
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:10,916
Yes.

456
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,125
But what did I do?

457
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:16,125
Run!

458
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:24,333
Wow!

459
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:27,166
I never imagined our first
date will be in a classroom.

460
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:30,708
Shinu, I am no normal
girl you can win over.

461
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,250
If you don't stop following me...

462
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,470
then you'll definitely die in Bangalore.

463
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,416
Your body will be cremated in Ooty...

464
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:40,958
and Angad will immerse
your ashes in Goa's sea.

465
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:42,698
Why are you so scared of Angad?

466
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,416
Lodge a complaint with the police.

467
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:49,416
Do you know who Angad is?

468
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,625
Maybe I was unfortunate...

469
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:58,625
that one day this
hassle came till my house.

470
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,198
I think it's the driver. - Yes.

471
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:12,125
I'll be right there.

472
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:13,125
Hello.

473
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,708
Hello, aunty, Angad Negi.

474
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,688
Your friendly neighborhood policeman.

475
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,750
Sari for you.

476
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,125
Hey.

477
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,466
Sister-in-law Sunaina
looks just like her mom.

478
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:24,291
Who are you, and what you want?

479
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:25,541
Uncle.

480
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,041
Hello, uncle. This suit-piece is for you.

481
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,791
It's Raymond.
- Because everybody loves Raymond.

482
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:34,000
Give sweets to everyone. - Yes.

483
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,180
Elders say after you eat something sweet..

484
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,666
It's difficult to say harsh words.

485
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,206
Sir, this is my horoscope.

486
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,208
Don't worry. Now that our
hearts have matched...

487
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:42,750
so will our horoscopes.

488
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:43,916
They have.

489
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,625
Sister-in-law, hello.

490
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,916
Sunaina.

491
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:50,375
After all, I am deeply
in love with Sunaina.

492
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,125
Let's take a picture.

493
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,426
Brother, sister-in-law,
let's take a picture.

494
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,416
Come to closer.

495
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:56,875
Smile please.

496
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:57,936
Smile come on.

497
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,046
Give each other a hug.

498
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,041
You two are going to be together...

499
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:03,333
Stop it.

500
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:07,333
Dad.

501
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,416
How dare you?

502
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,076
Barge in my house and dare...

503
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:17,125
to speak about marrying my daughter.

504
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,833
Let's make one thing clear.

505
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,333
My daughter doesn't like you.

506
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:27,416
I am a respectable citizen of this country.

507
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:31,375
My taxes pay for your salary.

508
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:35,583
And if you ever look at
my daughter again...

509
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,708
then I will complain to your seniors.

510
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,289
Brother, don't get furious.

511
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,208
Don't get furious.

512
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:42,428
Don't get furious.

513
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,458
Calm down. Calm down.

514
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,291
I am not getting angry. I am not angry.

515
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:49,958
He's like my father.

516
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:51,291
I am sorry, sir.

517
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,875
He said sorry to you.

518
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,291
Let's shake hands and
forget all grievances.

519
00:29:56,791 --> 00:30:00,291
Shake hands, uncle.

520
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:10,916
What did you do, uncle?

521
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:16,000
You shot a policeman.

522
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,625
Peter, for how long will he be jailed?

523
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,333
By the time he comes out...

524
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:24,958
your children will call us uncle.

525
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,218
Peter, knock-knock.

526
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:28,041
Who is it? - Scapegoat.

527
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:34,458
Scapegoat, who?
- Him, the one who's trapped.

528
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,833
Daddy, the decision is in your hands.

529
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,333
Either you go to jail for this bullet...

530
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:44,250
or Sunaina comes to my home.

531
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,208
If anyone sees us together...
- Don't worry.

532
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,208
Just be calm and have faith in Shinu.

533
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,348
You know what, whether you live or die...

534
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:52,342
I really don't care.

535
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,916
You know what? Whether I live or die...
I think you do care.

536
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,208
Don't just stand here...

537
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:07,375
with hockey in your hands
and jockeys in your pant.

538
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,250
Let your sister-in-law go.

539
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,458
Sister-in-law?

540
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:14,458
She's your sister-in-law, don't stare.

541
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:21,166
Where is he?

542
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,333
Guys, I am not in the mood right now.

543
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:00,416
Please come back some other time.

544
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,000
What mood?

545
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,541
Look, we borrowed these hockey sticks...

546
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:08,333
and baseball bats from other students.

547
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,394
We cannot return them without using it.

548
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,375
I see, is that so?

549
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,250
Then I'll give you three options.

550
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,833
I'll bash the first one.

551
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,125
Thrash the second one.

552
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,000
And I'll thrash the third
one, put him back together...

553
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,380
and bash him again.

554
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,510
That's my favorite.

555
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:23,875
Vicky.

556
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,916
Giri.

557
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:29,916
Goldie.

558
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,546
Now for the thrashing.

559
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:44,541
No. 2.

560
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,958
Now for the 3rd, my favorite.

561
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,541
Goldie.

562
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:58,916
"I am bad."

563
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:00,666
Don't push.

564
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,326
Didn't you hear what he said?

565
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:03,916
I'll bash the first one.

566
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,136
Thrash the second.

567
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,875
And I'll thrash the third
one, put him back together...

568
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,291
and bash him again.

569
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,125
That's his favorite, you go.

570
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:11,385
What are you doing?

571
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:13,228
Hurry up, I am getting late for class.

572
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,833
I've three options.

573
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,291
First, I'll run.

574
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,416
Second, I'll run faster.

575
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,833
And third... That one's my favorite.

576
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,833
I'll disappear in thin air.

577
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,375
Tell me name. - Sir, his name's Shinu.

578
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:39,375
Full name, Srinath Prasad.

579
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:43,208
Sir, I came to Bangalore to study.

580
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:46,458
Actually what happened is
I entered college at 9am.

581
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,458
At 9:05 I met lord Krishna.

582
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:53,250
And 5 minutes later he
introduced me to Sunaina.

583
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,000
So it's not my fault.

584
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,083
Continue.

585
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,333
Sir, I followed her around the campus...

586
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,434
like the doggie in
the mobile network ad.

587
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,083
I even sung a song for her
like AR Rehman's jingle.

588
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:05,704
But when I found out that...

589
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,791
this prepaid card has
already been registered...

590
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:09,875
in the name of Inspector Angad Negi.

591
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,666
I stepped back, sir.

592
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:16,666
I don't want relations, sir.

593
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,250
He followed Sunaina like a doggie.

594
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,500
He even sung a song.

595
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,500
You didn't tell me.

596
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,125
Sir, actually I am from a nice family.

597
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:34,083
See you. Peace.

598
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:36,333
You think Sunaina has the guts...

599
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:39,583
too fall in love with someone else?

600
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:43,083
If a girl truly loves a boy...

601
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:44,704
then she won't be scared.

602
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,250
And if a boy really loves a girl...

603
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,750
then doesn't really make a difference...

604
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,970
whether she's the Minister's daughter...

605
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,750
or some Police inspector's girlfriend.

606
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:56,833
All the best.

607
00:34:57,333 --> 00:35:00,291
I'll give you one chance.

608
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:02,166
Try to win Sunaina's heart.

609
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:03,916
Me?

610
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:05,708
I came here to study, sir.

611
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:07,791
And half the college loves Sunaina...

612
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:09,171
anyone will accept it.

613
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:11,958
No, no.

614
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,500
You will do it.

615
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,166
Only you.

616
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,958
"I am bad."

617
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:22,833
By the way, sir, I believe that 99.99%...

618
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,733
she will definitely fall for me.

619
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,000
And in just three days.

620
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,666
But for those three days better
tell these scoundrels...

621
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:34,416
"The flowers and the stars have to say."

622
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:38,708
"For the next three days
Sunaina's only mine."

623
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:41,125
If you don't mind, I mean...

624
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:45,125
Sir.

625
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:51,541
Angad, this boy's a rascal.

626
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,441
What if he wins over sister-in-law?

627
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:56,666
Angad, I forgot to tell you one thing.
- What?

628
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:59,958
Taking Sunaina around, to the movies...

629
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,916
buying her coke, taking
her to a disco 9-12...

630
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:04,541
will cost money.

631
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:05,875
"I am bad."

632
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:08,495
She's your girl so you'll
have to pay for it as well.

633
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,375
Yes, that's true.

634
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,625
After all it's the question of
sister-in-law's comfort level.

635
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,246
Think of it as loose-change.

636
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:13,916
You've a big heart.

637
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:15,217
I've small expenses.

638
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:18,791
Don't forget to pray for me.
I am your younger brother.

639
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:24,343
Peter, knock-knock.

640
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,250
Knock-knock who? - GK.

641
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,250
GK who?

642
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,916
What's the point of this boy's life?

643
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:36,176
For the sake of teaching
Sunaina a lesson...

644
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:39,916
he will have to die.

645
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:59,250
Shinu?

646
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,458
Hello coward.

647
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:01,519
Are you crazy?

648
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,760
What are you doing?

649
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,875
"Dil jumping japak jumpak-jumpak."

650
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:09,125
What are you doing?

651
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:12,416
By the way, do you celebrate
Diwali at home every day?

652
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:15,416
Why? - Why are you so scared?

653
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:16,837
You're scared of Angad.

654
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,375
You're scared of his cronies.

655
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:19,915
I am not scared of anyone.

656
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:21,333
Hello, uncle.

657
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,541
You're even scared of your dad.

658
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,208
Look, please go before mom-dad come here.

659
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:28,750
Mom and dad are at home?

660
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,666
Then, mom-dad... Shinu's coming.
- Shinu, please.

661
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,791
Nice room.

662
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:36,375
Wow. - Shinu stop it.

663
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,666
Double-spring multipurpose mattress.

664
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:41,583
Daddy's spent well.

665
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:45,250
Oh, your cheeks were better
when you were a kid.

666
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,791
But you've better legs now.

667
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,791
Shinu, please leave. - Okay.

668
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,250
Not that way.

669
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,833
Shinu please stop

670
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,875
I am ready to do anything.

671
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,041
Anything?

672
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:02,458
What are you doing? - Anything.

673
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,416
What are you doing? - You said anything.

674
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,333
What are you doing?

675
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:11,125
Sometimes you say I've
better legs, sometimes...

676
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,041
I don't get you.

677
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,708
If you want to understand...

678
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,875
then come to CCD tomorrow, okay?

679
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,458
Okay.

680
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:23,458
Bye.

681
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,666
Hi uncle. Aunty.

682
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:35,000
I came to show Sunaina my six-pack abs.

683
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,000
Okay, bye.

684
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,041
So did you go to CCD in the morning?
- No way.

685
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:45,375
The further I stay from Shinu the better.

686
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:49,375
You might stay away but he's coming closer.

687
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,958
You made a big mistake not coming to CCD.

688
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:09,958
Now I'm going to say it publicly.

689
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:16,083
Where is it?

690
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:17,333
Where is it?

691
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:20,250
Where is it?

692
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,708
Found it.

693
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,375
I love you!

694
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,166
Didn't you hear?

695
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:34,166
I...love... you!

696
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,833
You can take all the
time you want to reply.

697
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,125
Day, 1 day, 2 days, 2 days...

698
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:48,000
but maximum 3 days.

699
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,833
Today you're scared of Angad.

700
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,613
Tomorrow it may be someone else.

701
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:52,875
The more you fear them...

702
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:56,875
the more they'll scare you.

703
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:02,333
Nice catch.

704
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:09,875
What?

705
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:10,250
What are you staring at?

706
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,875
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.

707
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:18,375
You dogs, remember your boss' instructions.

708
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:23,875
For three days you can
watch, bark but no biting.

709
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:26,791
Move!

710
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,333
Bro, sister-in-law's
slipped from our hands.

711
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:33,333
Shut up!

712
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,625
How many would you give her?

713
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:39,416
4 on 10.

714
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:41,791
8 on 10.

715
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:43,541
I'll give her minus.

716
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,541
Losers!

717
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:52,083
How much for me? - Number?

718
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,983
4 for Gauri, minus points for Isha.

719
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,916
We just... - He got it.

720
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:58,333
Don't interfere.

721
00:40:58,833 --> 00:40:59,793
You say. - 10 out of 10.

722
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,458
You're giving number to sister-in-law.

723
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:04,916
Don't you dare call me sister-in-law.

724
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:08,083
Learn to respect women, not disrespect her.

725
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:10,416
Whether she's of any shape, size or color.

726
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:11,666
Got it. - Yes.

727
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:15,666
Indian woman... wreaked
havoc on Angad's crony.

728
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,000
Go on. - Should I?

729
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,750
Don't be scared, go.

730
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,458
Well done.

731
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:30,250
What are you doing? Everyone's watching.

732
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,625
Coward, let them watch if they want.

733
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:36,625
And I am not a coward.

734
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:02,083
"The sickness of honesty..."

735
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:32,833
"Forsake the sickness of
honesty and come to me."

736
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:34,666
"Come running to me."

737
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:38,250
"The heart invites you."

738
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,958
"All night the height of shamelessness."

739
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:45,875
"All night the height of shamelessness."

740
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:52,958
"Just you and me... and dim lights."

741
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:56,833
"All night the height of shamelessness."

742
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:00,583
"All night the height of shamelessness."

743
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:04,583
"Just you and me... and dim lights."

744
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:37,166
"I am a bit spoilt, so be spoiled like me."

745
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:45,208
"I'll take a step forward, so do you."

746
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:48,958
"Let the intentions get a little bad."

747
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:52,083
"The air around feels intoxicating."

748
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,875
"Intoxicating."

749
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,791
"Intoxicating."

750
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:57,541
"Intoxicating."

751
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,833
"Intoxicating."

752
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:03,416
"Let's drink up the intoxicating moments."

753
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:06,500
"Let's live them together."

754
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,833
"It makes us excited."

755
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:13,666
"All night the height of shamelessness."

756
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:17,416
"All night the height of shamelessness."

757
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:21,416
"Just you and me... and dim lights."

758
00:44:56,875 --> 00:45:03,708
"The heart has disappeared from its place."

759
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:11,250
"It's all happened because of you."

760
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,041
"I want to breathe this air with you."

761
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:18,333
"Hold my hands and take
me anywhere you like."

762
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,208
"Holding hands."

763
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:22,041
"Holding hands."

764
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:23,875
"Together."

765
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:25,916
"Together."

766
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:29,625
"I desire... to be naughty."

767
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:32,625
"At this age, in the journey of love."

768
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:36,000
"What's wrong and right?"

769
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,916
"All night the height of shamelessness."

770
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:43,500
"All night the height of shamelessness."

771
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,500
"Just you and me... and dim lights."

772
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:14,962
Where's Srinath Prasad?

773
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:16,886
He retired from the cricket team long back.

774
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:22,083
He must be in the commentary box now, sir.

775
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:23,083
Sir...

776
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:26,916
There he is.

777
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,916
Why do you want to sacrifice
your life for your friend?

778
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:33,916
Where is he?

779
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,375
I saw him in the theatre
yesterday with Sunaina.

780
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:39,458
They were sitting on the same
seat and watching a movie.

781
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:41,118
Sister-in-law on Shinu's lap.

782
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:42,541
The matter's out of hand.

783
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,208
Sir, I am not your level.

784
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:48,208
Please, put me down. Please, leave me.

785
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:58,625
Yes tell me, where are you?

786
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:02,250
How did they disappear?

787
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,458
What's the point in helping you.

788
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,458
Search them everywhere.

789
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:10,000
They must be somewhere.

790
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,100
Come on, Dhoni.

791
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:15,791
We need a six. We need a helicopter shot.

792
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,666
What a shot, Dhoni. What a shot.

793
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:24,166
Come on.

794
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:28,166
Angad.

795
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:36,375
Why did I come here?

796
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:39,625
Why? Why? Why?

797
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:40,958
Oh yes.

798
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,791
Sunaina's fallen in love with me.

799
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:45,125
Actually... she's deeply in love with me.

800
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:48,750
Brother, that's your kind of love.

801
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,541
Look, she's calling.

802
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:54,166
Hello, sister-in-law.

803
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:57,333
Hello. - What's my baby doing?

804
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,208
She called him baby? - Sunaina.

805
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:03,541
Actually, I want to hear you
say those lovely three words.

806
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:04,541
Baby.

807
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:06,041
Shinu called her baby.

808
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:07,541
I can hear that too.

809
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:08,875
Say it, Sunaina.

810
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:10,456
How many times do I say it?

811
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:13,291
I love you, Shinu.

812
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:16,666
Listen, with a bit more feeling...

813
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:20,541
and stress on "Love".

814
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:24,333
I love you...

815
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,250
You're killing me.

816
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,875
Can't take it. One more. Last.

817
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:35,041
Now a sweet, soft, strawberry flavored...

818
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:39,041
Shinu wants to eat ice-cream.

819
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:44,125
After that you need prayers.

820
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,791
I am coming. I'll see you later.

821
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:47,741
Okay.

822
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,583
Peter, find yourself another sister-in-law.

823
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:53,583
Negi sir, bye. - Enjoy it.

824
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,875
Lovedale Street, House No. 24, Ooty.

825
00:48:58,375 --> 00:48:59,855
Your mother teaches small children...

826
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,601
at Little Angel school
and your father...

827
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:05,333
runs the only supermarket in Ooty.

828
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:09,333
Right?

829
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:11,625
You know my home's geography...

830
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,958
you know my parent's biography.

831
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:20,333
But unfortunately... you didn't
find out my entire history.

832
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,793
Since I was a kid I was
thrown out of 15 schools.

833
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:25,166
10 police officers even took
transfer because of me.

834
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:29,166
And few MLAs even deserted
their post because of me.

835
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:33,750
When I was leaving city...

836
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,291
the entire city came to bid me farewell.

837
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:38,833
I look sweet, innocent.

838
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:41,833
But actually, I am a big rascal.

839
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:43,208
"I am bad."

840
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:46,250
And Angad, if you ever think about...

841
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,125
my mom-dad or Sunaina, then...

842
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:50,186
I'll catch the next train to Meerut.

843
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,416
I'll go to alley no 14, house no 12...

844
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:54,436
touch your mother's feet and say...

845
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:56,833
Aunt, please forgive me.

846
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,213
Because I am going to
make your son's plight...

847
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:02,833
same as Sachin and Sehwag did
to Pakistan in 2003 World Cup.

848
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,666
Right, brother. They both played so well.

849
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:10,666
Shinu!

850
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,958
So you've finally shown
your true colors, Angad.

851
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:15,819
First you trapped Sunaina's dad...

852
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,090
by shooting Peter.

853
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:19,250
Today you're trapping Peter by shooting me.

854
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,350
It's always Peter who's trapped. Right, Peter?
- Yes, he's right.

855
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:22,875
Move, Peter.

856
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,416
Turn your gun to the other side.
- Come on shoot.

857
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:25,876
Control, Peter, control.

858
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:28,291
To hell with control, turn the gun around.

859
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:29,791
Shoot. - Peter, move.

860
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,583
Angad, this won't do. - Come on shoot.

861
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:34,000
Peter, move.

862
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,791
Peter, move.

863
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:36,791
Shoot.

864
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:38,500
Peter, move. Come on shoot.

865
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,500
Don't shoot.

866
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:59,875
Peter.

867
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,750
Angad, you shot me again.

868
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:05,250
Peter, I told you to move.

869
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,541
Sir, what's going on here...

870
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:08,958
Sir...

871
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:11,250
How did you enter my house?

872
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,541
Wait. Please...

873
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:17,416
Sir...

874
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:18,958
Knock-knock.

875
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:21,250
Knock-knock, Peter. - Who is it?

876
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,166
Scapegoat. - Scapegoat who?

877
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:27,166
The one that got trapped.

878
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:35,250
"I am bad."

879
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:39,083
"I am bad."

880
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:43,083
"I am bad."

881
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:51,458
Wow, my hero.

882
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:55,791
I am no hero, I am just an ordinary boy.

883
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:58,000
You got Angad suspended. - Yes.

884
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,500
Showed my mom-dad your six packs. - Yes.

885
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,083
But how did you do it?

886
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:06,291
"Nothing's gonna change my love for you."

887
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:10,083
"You ought to know that
by now that I love you."

888
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:12,958
"One thing you can be sure of."

889
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:16,958
"Nothing's gonna change my love for you."

890
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,458
Shinu!

891
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,875
Shinu!

892
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:11,166
Shinu!

893
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:12,458
Help!

894
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,250
Shinu!

895
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:15,291
Shinu!

896
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:16,416
Sunaina!

897
00:53:16,916 --> 00:53:17,625
Shinu!

898
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:21,625
My leg..

899
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,958
Shinu. - Sunaina!

900
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:36,958
Shinu!

901
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:40,750
Sunaina

902
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:48,583
Sunaina

903
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,041
Hello, Shinu.

904
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:17,041
Not Shinu.

905
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:18,833
Full name Srinath Prasad.

906
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:22,291
Angad, where's Sunaina?

907
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:25,333
What do you think I abducted Sunaina?

908
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:28,750
Helicopters are not my budget.

909
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,500
His power and budget is
limited on the ground.

910
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,041
Peter, shut up.

911
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:36,958
Angad just tell me where's Sunaina.

912
00:54:37,458 --> 00:54:38,916
Remember, few months ago...

913
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:42,916
during the Ooty to
Bangalore train-ride...

914
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:47,833
Do you know who's Babu?

915
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:49,875
Who Babu's father is?

916
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:51,416
Who Babu's brother is?

917
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:53,333
Not him, stupid.

918
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:54,541
There was someone else on that train...

919
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,208
who was floored by your
punch lines and punches.

920
00:54:57,708 --> 00:55:01,208
I wonder why?

921
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:05,333
This will cost you dearly. - Fine.

922
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:07,958
Anyway, Shinu doesn't like cheap things.

923
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:11,958
Get out!

924
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:17,583
That day on that train your fate changed.

925
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:21,250
Ayesha Singhal fell in love with you.

926
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,083
Do you know who her father is?

927
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:25,916
Vikrant Singhal.

928
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:29,458
Asia and Africa's biggest gangster.

929
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:32,250
The world's helpless in front of him...

930
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,166
but he has just one weakness.

931
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:38,708
His daughter, Ayesha.

932
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:41,291
Vikrant's men came to us looking for you.

933
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,333
We said Shinu's a rascal.

934
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:44,708
You can't get your hands on him so easily.

935
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:46,833
But if you take Sunaina...

936
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:48,791
then he'll follow you like
the mobile network's dog...

937
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:51,291
singing AR Rehman's jingle.

938
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:55,291
Hey...

939
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,125
Son, you've two options.

940
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:00,583
Either go to Bangkok and marry Ayesha.

941
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:04,583
Or face Vikrant's bullet.

942
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,220
Peter knock-knock.

943
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,140
Knock-knock who?

944
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:09,500
Pop. - Pop who?

945
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,916
We'll enjoy the popcorn now.

946
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:14,375
There's a twist in the story now.

947
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:15,375
Come on.

948
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:16,791
Let's go.

949
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:20,791
Eat some popcorn, and get healthy,

950
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:47,000
"Where are you looking?
Your hero's right here."

951
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:51,000
"Where are you looking?
Your hero's right here."

952
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:21,666
Jesus, you here.

953
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:26,125
Ganpati and Krishna have told
me everything about you.

954
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:29,458
And your slam-bang tactics won't work here.

955
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:31,198
Look, there's difficulty ahead.

956
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:34,625
But these difficulties can
be solved only with love.

957
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:37,916
So take your love away with
love and not violence.

958
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:41,833
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

959
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:46,541
Amen.
- Ali sir, that boy has arrived from India.

960
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:48,125
Greet him, boys.

961
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:52,125
Greet him. - Okay.

962
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:28,458
Daddy, he's come.

963
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:46,916
Welcome, son-in-law. Welcome.

964
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:52,208
I was wondering what made
Ayesha crazy about you.

965
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:55,208
Now I realized that she
saw the same thing..

966
00:58:55,708 --> 00:59:00,708
..her mother saw in me years ago.

967
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,833
Just like every coke isn't cola..

968
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:06,791
..every chickpeas can't
be made into a curry.

969
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:12,000
Similarly, not every innocent
looking boy is nave.

970
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,166
Balli darling, do you
want cola or chickpeas?

971
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:18,416
Vikrant bhai, forget the words
understand the emotion.

972
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:21,875
Emotions.

973
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:25,875
Shinu.

974
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:30,583
You think I am a kid.

975
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:34,583
You think I can't take Sunaina away.

976
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:41,416
Sir..

977
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:44,041
I hail from a small city like Ooty.

978
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,261
And every Indian who doesn't get a chance..

979
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,000
..to be born in the Tata's
or the Ambani's family..

980
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:56,250
..dream for an opportunity
to win over their daughter.

981
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,041
The groom is ready, sir.

982
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:02,041
Where's the bride?

983
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:04,958
I like him.

984
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,041
I like him.

985
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:10,041
I like my son-in-law.

986
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:14,166
Even I like her, what a beauty.

987
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:18,208
I like you.

988
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:21,666
My lady.

989
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:24,000
She's my sister-in-law. - Sister-in-law.

990
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,708
Vikrant's girlfriend. - Okay.

991
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:28,083
Veronica.

992
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,750
Calm down, Balli.

993
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,625
Everyone makes this mistake.

994
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:36,708
Viki darling, I missed you.
- I missed you too.

995
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:39,000
But sir where is the Ayesha, mother.

996
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,000
Mummy.

997
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:42,666
Ayesha's mother..

998
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:48,458
When Ayesha was four, her mother
and my first wife passed away..

999
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:50,583
..and since them I am a widower.

1000
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:52,375
Widower. Widower. Widower.

1001
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:54,833
Sir, why do you.. - What do you mean?

1002
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,666
You mean.. - Balli darling.

1003
01:00:57,166 --> 01:01:00,208
Vikrant was born in the valleys of Manali.

1004
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:04,208
So often his voice echoes.

1005
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,625
Son, whenever you miss your mother..

1006
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,166
..you can come to me.

1007
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:13,906
Shower me with your affection..

1008
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:16,416
Don't ever do that.

1009
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:18,666
But there's a small problem.

1010
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:22,916
Sunaina.

1011
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:26,458
Sir, middle-class girls
should be left in the middle.

1012
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:29,416
Smart boy.

1013
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:31,717
You're marrying my
daughter tomorrow, got it.

1014
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:32,645
I don't care.

1015
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:35,708
Father-in-law, give me 10 days.

1016
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:39,250
So that I can get to know Ayesha. Bonding.

1017
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,250
Son-in-law, the wedding's tomorrow.

1018
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:45,541
Dad, I waited so long for Shinu.

1019
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:50,291
So, can't I wait for 10 more
days for his happiness?

1020
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:51,551
Just do as he says.

1021
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,208
Emotional blackmail.

1022
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,166
As you wish my princess.

1023
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:56,583
Come on.

1024
01:01:57,083 --> 01:01:58,291
Thank you, daddy.

1025
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:00,375
Anything for you my darling. - Sir.

1026
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:01,916
So sweet. - Sir.

1027
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:03,217
Very handsome. -Yes.

1028
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:04,208
Sir, here. - Yes.

1029
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:05,208
Sir, I was saying now that..

1030
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:08,208
..your daughter and I are getting married..

1031
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:10,750
..then send Sunaina back? - Why?

1032
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:12,410
Because if my ex stays here..

1033
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:14,473
..then I'll feel extremely uncomfortable.

1034
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:15,875
Vikrant.

1035
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:18,791
Like every beggar needs a signal

1036
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:21,750
Like every Gym needs a dumbbell.

1037
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,125
Similarly this girl needs to stay here.

1038
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:27,505
Balli darling, do you
want to beg with her or..

1039
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:28,598
..go to the gym.

1040
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:33,750
Vikrant bhai, forget the words
understand the emotion.

1041
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,250
This girl will guarantee
that Shinu won't run away.

1042
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:38,250
Got it.

1043
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:40,371
The girl stays here until
you two don't get married.

1044
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:41,421
No, sir.. - I said it.

1045
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:42,166
But.. - No.

1046
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:43,625
Shut up.

1047
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:44,916
Let's go, darling.

1048
01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:46,375
Dadzu.

1049
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:47,666
Okay.

1050
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:48,967
Remember one thing..

1051
01:02:49,416 --> 01:02:51,083
Dad..Dadzu, no violence.

1052
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:53,125
No violence. No violence.

1053
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:57,416
Bye Dadzu.

1054
01:02:57,916 --> 01:02:59,291
Come on.

1055
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:03,583
I hate you.

1056
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:06,416
Hi, Sunaina.

1057
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,125
My dad's been pampering me..

1058
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:11,083
..since I was in my diapers.

1059
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:13,000
Whether it's clothes or shoes..

1060
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,333
..my dad always brings me an extra piece.

1061
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:20,458
You didn't get time to
pack before you left.

1062
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:24,375
So I got these for you.

1063
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,833
You can wear my designer dresses.

1064
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:29,208
Wear my Jimmy Chu's shoes.

1065
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:31,166
Use my makeup.

1066
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:32,916
What's mine is yours.

1067
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:36,916
Except for Shinu.

1068
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:45,833
He's calling me.

1069
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:47,833
Shinu cheater.

1070
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:51,833
You coward.

1071
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,375
You try it too.

1072
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:01,458
I saw your styles, I just
need to see your aim.

1073
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:03,250
Ayesha, I've a problem.

1074
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:04,916
Looking London Talking Tokyo.

1075
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:05,916
I can't..

1076
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:08,458
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

1077
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:12,458
To aim right and to look right too.

1078
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:20,666
Now I know..how Basanti felt..

1079
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:24,250
..when Veeru was teaching
her to fire a gun.

1080
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:28,250
Fire.

1081
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:32,208
Balli darling, I think
son-in-law will be ready..

1082
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:35,250
..to join the family business.

1083
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:36,470
He shoots so well.

1084
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:39,625
Shoots. Shoots.

1085
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:41,791
You like Tommy. - Tommy?

1086
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:45,166
Tom Cruise?
- Yeah, I'd love to take a cruise with him.

1087
01:04:45,666 --> 01:04:48,083
And..Yes.

1088
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:50,666
Dhoni. - Yes, he's my Mahi.

1089
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:51,708
I love Mahi.

1090
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,541
And then comes..

1091
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:54,625
Oh yeah.

1092
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:58,416
You shouldn't ask such small
questions in a big country.

1093
01:04:58,916 --> 01:04:59,458
Correct.

1094
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:04,250
But do you love Tony, Dhoni and Shahrukh.

1095
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,041
No. - Exactly.

1096
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:08,458
You were impressed by few of my punches..

1097
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:10,158
..and you thought it was love.

1098
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:12,333
Ayesha, you like me.

1099
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:13,553
You don't love me.

1100
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,833
I don't love me.

1101
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:18,541
I love you.

1102
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:20,625
I love you.

1103
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,458
Okay, Ayesha you love me.

1104
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:28,458
But true love is never
one way, its two ways.

1105
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,083
Like..when I saw Sunaina
for the first time..

1106
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:33,458
..bells started ringing in our heart.

1107
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,250
When you saw me on the train..

1108
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:36,541
..did you hear bells ringing in your heart?

1109
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:37,541
No.

1110
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:41,250
There were no bells ringing.

1111
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,958
I am ready to leave Sunaina for you.

1112
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:46,338
But there were no bells
ringing in your heart..

1113
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:49,750
..so who says you love me.

1114
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,833
What kind of logic is that?

1115
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:55,833
Bells..b***s?

1116
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:38,708
Where's Shinu? - I don't know.

1117
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:43,708
I was sleeping.

1118
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,083
Just like May comes before June.

1119
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:49,833
Just like six comes after five.

1120
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:54,833
Similarly, every dog has his day.

1121
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:58,291
You mean..you're a dog of this house?

1122
01:06:58,791 --> 01:07:02,291
Yes, I am the dog of this house.

1123
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:14,208
And I know that..Shinu is
hiding somewhere in this house.

1124
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:21,750
I'll wait outside.

1125
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,458
Okay.

1126
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:26,416
Goodnight.
- I'll be watching for him tell him that.

1127
01:07:26,916 --> 01:07:28,875
Okay, bye.

1128
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:30,833
What did you say?

1129
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,375
Middleclass girl should
be left in the middle.

1130
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:34,835
Sunaina, I want romance.

1131
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:36,323
I want romance. I want romance.

1132
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,875
Shinu, this isn't romance.

1133
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:39,875
Okay, okay.

1134
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:41,575
Sunaina, it's been three days.

1135
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:43,166
Aren't you happy to see me?

1136
01:07:43,666 --> 01:07:45,416
Shinu, this is no joke.

1137
01:07:45,916 --> 01:07:47,237
They aren't Angad and his goons..

1138
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,833
..these guys are dangerous.
- I know, Sunaina.

1139
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:53,416
And I am sorry that you got in
this problem because of me.

1140
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:58,125
But..if you love me, then trust me.

1141
01:07:58,625 --> 01:08:00,541
Shinu.

1142
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:03,041
I trust you.

1143
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:07,041
That's why I love you.

1144
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:11,541
So come on.

1145
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:13,958
Now?

1146
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:17,958
Now!

1147
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:29,333
Come on hurry up.

1148
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,458
Peter, check all entry and exits.

1149
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:48,238
All entry and exits. - Okay sir.

1150
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:51,625
Don't even let a mosquito out of this house.
- Right sir.

1151
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:54,083
But, Balli, how can Shinu
escape on your watch?

1152
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:55,863
Just like Superman wears a cape.

1153
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,875
Just like King Kong's called an ape.

1154
01:08:58,375 --> 01:08:59,895
Similarly..- This is the Great Escape.

1155
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:01,958
Balli, forget the words, let's find Shinu.

1156
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:06,791
Follow me. - Yes.

1157
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:08,250
Shinu!

1158
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:09,458
This way.

1159
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:13,458
Come on.

1160
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,916
What now?

1161
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:22,916
Now He'll do whatever needs to be done.

1162
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,958
"I haven't seen Kashi, or Neelkanth."

1163
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:38,333
"I haven't seen Baidnath or Devgarh."

1164
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:42,791
"O Lord, my eyes yearn to behold you."

1165
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:47,291
"Glory to..Bholenath."

1166
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:48,791
"Bholenath! Shambhunath!"

1167
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:49,583
"Listen to the voice in my heart."

1168
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:51,791
"I'll worship You all day, all night."

1169
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:56,416
"I've dedicated my life to
You, you're my benefactor."

1170
01:09:56,916 --> 01:10:00,375
"Glory to..Bholenath."

1171
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:04,791
"I am obsessed now, Lord, you don't know."

1172
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:09,875
"Lord, you don't recognize my devotion."

1173
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:12,255
"I'm standing at your
threshold to behold you."

1174
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,458
"Why don't You understand?"

1175
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:15,718
"Bhole, my heart.."

1176
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:16,843
"Bhole, my heart.."

1177
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,041
"Bhole, my heart doesn't listen."

1178
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:20,381
"My heart wants to.."

1179
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:21,548
"My heart wants to.."

1180
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:23,541
"My heart wants to behold you."

1181
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:26,000
"My heart's restless, it's eager.."

1182
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,000
"..about You, I don't know why."

1183
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,260
"Bhole, my heart.."

1184
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:30,468
"Bhole, my heart.."

1185
01:10:30,916 --> 01:10:34,416
"Bhole, my heart doesn't listen."

1186
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:37,458
Hail Bholenath.

1187
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:39,958
It's over. - I know.

1188
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:41,500
Wow, son.

1189
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,750
See, Balli darling, the
house where death's..

1190
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:46,970
What is the point?

1191
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:49,165
The point is he took the
Lord's name in this house.

1192
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:49,933
Thank you, sir.

1193
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:52,558
Shinu, you're a good son-in-law.
- No, hold on. Hold on a second.

1194
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:53,958
Tell me one thing.

1195
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,458
There's a huge idol of
Ganesh in this house.

1196
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:58,708
So why worship this painting?

1197
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:01,958
Balli, isn't he Bappa's Papa? - Yes, so?

1198
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,875
So first comes Papa, then comes Bappa.

1199
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:07,833
Got it. - No, no, tell me one thing.

1200
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:10,291
Who worships the lord at 4 in the morning?

1201
01:11:10,791 --> 01:11:13,333
Balli, Gods should be
worshipped from the heart..

1202
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:14,833
..not according to time.

1203
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:16,666
So did you write this song in Ooty, son?
- Yes, sir.

1204
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:18,767
What's the source? - Sir, it's original.

1205
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:19,458
Original.

1206
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:23,250
Original. Original. Original.

1207
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:27,208
See, Bappa.

1208
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:30,000
Your Papa saved me today.

1209
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,458
Hail Bhole.

1210
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,083
Shinu, you didn't spare my Father either.

1211
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:38,000
I wish to strangle you with my trunk.

1212
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:42,041
Sir there are two indians.

1213
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:44,833
Let them both in.

1214
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:48,416
Oh, God!

1215
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:50,250
Everything so nice.

1216
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,541
Brother angad.

1217
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:55,791
Amazing.

1218
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:59,125
Oh, God!

1219
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:00,666
Sir, Shinu's Mercedes.

1220
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:01,886
Shinu's waterfall.

1221
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:04,246
Shinu's swimming pool, the
entire palace is so huge.

1222
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:06,125
Shinu has hit such a big jackpot.

1223
01:12:06,625 --> 01:12:10,041
Sir, you can take sister-in-law
to your 200 sq. ft..- You..

1224
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:12,250
True love doesn't happen in palaces.

1225
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,791
There's devotion everywhere you see.

1226
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:15,958
Hello. - Hello.

1227
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:17,298
Welcome. - Greetings.

1228
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:18,333
Why are you touching the feet?

1229
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:22,458
These clothes are better than ours.

1230
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:26,750
Hey, Angad. Who gave you
the visa to come here?

1231
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:29,208
Anyway. Welcome to my land.

1232
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:32,583
Thailand! Thailand! Thailand! Thailand!

1233
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:33,764
Come on, come on.

1234
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:35,416
Vikrant sir, our deal was..

1235
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:38,541
..I'll give you Shinu and
you'll give me Sunaina, so..

1236
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:40,402
I'm here to take her back with me.

1237
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:41,833
That's not possible.

1238
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:44,000
You can take Sunaina back with you..

1239
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,500
..when my daughter gets married.

1240
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,750
And that's after 10 days, tell him that.

1241
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:49,811
After 10 days.

1242
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:52,583
After 10 days.

1243
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:55,333
10 days? - That's not the deal.

1244
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:56,914
I know that's not the deal.

1245
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:58,458
But don't worry, time flies.

1246
01:12:58,958 --> 01:12:59,639
10 days will fly.

1247
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:00,625
Fly. Fly.

1248
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:03,333
Why does he sound system
play in surround sound?

1249
01:13:03,833 --> 01:13:06,791
Because he was born in the valleys. - Yes.

1250
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:10,083
Congratulations on your marriage, Ayesha.

1251
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:12,375
I am sorry about the slap.

1252
01:13:12,875 --> 01:13:14,583
But she's not Ayesha baby.

1253
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:17,250
She's my girlfriend, Veronica.

1254
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:18,311
Tell him that.

1255
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,291
Cool down, baby.

1256
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:21,833
Everyone makes that mistake.

1257
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,208
Sorry.

1258
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:25,291
But..anyone can make this mistake..

1259
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:29,583
..seeing this gorgeous lady
standing next to the old building.

1260
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:32,958
Sir..can I at least meet Sunaina.

1261
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:34,625
Of course.

1262
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:37,958
Call Sunaina. - Yes sir.

1263
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:39,583
She's a nice girl.

1264
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,666
Look after her.

1265
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,446
Mr. Singhal, Sunaina is missing.

1266
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:44,791
Find her.

1267
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:48,791
That rascal Shinu must
have eloped with her.

1268
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:56,666
Don't move - Father-in-law.

1269
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,750
Dadzu. - Ayeshu.

1270
01:13:59,250 --> 01:13:59,931
What's happening?

1271
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,200
Why are you carrying this gun?

1272
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:03,375
I wanted to bless my
son-in-law with my gun.

1273
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:04,375
I mean..

1274
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:06,416
Vikrant, we've found Sunaina.

1275
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:07,916
What? - Yes.

1276
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:11,041
This middleclass girl was
dancing in the bathroom.

1277
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:12,541
Okay, got it.

1278
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:14,402
We're just going for a long drive.

1279
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:16,791
Of course, go, go, go.

1280
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:17,791
Ayesha, go.

1281
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,767
I want to talk to father-in-law. - But..

1282
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:25,291
Ayesha, please. - Fine.

1283
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:29,583
We are here.

1284
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:31,916
Dad, you ruined everything.
- Listen to me..

1285
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:34,458
Tell me, father-in-law,
what is this all about?

1286
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:36,598
Nothing, son-in-law. - There's something.

1287
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:38,000
You're holding a gun.

1288
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,181
Angad's here too.

1289
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:41,333
Something's definitely wrong. Tell me.

1290
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:42,458
He came here to take Sunaina back.

1291
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:44,238
Sunaina was nowhere to be found.

1292
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:45,458
And you were missing too.

1293
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:47,545
And this idiot said you're
eloping with Sunaina.

1294
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:48,921
So I picked up my gun.

1295
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:51,166
That's what we do in the
Mafia..- What the..

1296
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:53,786
That means any idiot can
come and tell you anything..

1297
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:54,791
..and you will believe him? - No, no.

1298
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:56,750
I am your son-in-law. - Yes.

1299
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,041
And you doubt me?

1300
01:14:58,541 --> 01:14:59,458
Me? - No, no, no.

1301
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:01,039
What's the point of living?

1302
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:02,936
What's the point if you don't trust me?

1303
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:05,049
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Shoot me. Just shoot me.

1304
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:08,125
Shoot me. Just shoot me I say. - No.

1305
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:09,666
Are you mad?

1306
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:10,886
You could've died.

1307
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:12,291
This is fake sympathy.

1308
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:13,712
If you don't trust me..

1309
01:15:13,916 --> 01:15:14,625
..then send Sunaina back with him?

1310
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:16,791
I trust you.

1311
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:18,171
This is all his fault.

1312
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:19,343
It's all his fault.

1313
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,470
You don't mean it.

1314
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:21,914
Send Sunaina back with him?

1315
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:24,333
I swear on this, I trust you.

1316
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:26,958
No one trusts me, send
Sunaina away with him.

1317
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:29,291
Vikrant sir, when Shinu's
insisting so much..

1318
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:30,631
..then do as he says.

1319
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:33,083
And send Sunaina back with us.

1320
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:37,416
No, keep Sunaina with you.

1321
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:39,796
Remember one thing.. What's your name?
- Peter.

1322
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,375
I trust Shinu as much
as I love my daughter.

1323
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:46,196
Sunaina will stay in this house..

1324
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,458
..until the wedding day.

1325
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:51,083
Vikrant, it's been served.

1326
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:53,791
The plates have been served
on the dining table.

1327
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:55,541
Got it.

1328
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:57,875
Come on, son-in-law, let's have lunch.

1329
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:01,041
I've cooked Chicken Peri-Peri
personally for you.

1330
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:03,083
I cooked it. I cooked it. I cooked it.

1331
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:04,708
Chicken Peri-Peri?

1332
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:06,368
You're so concerned about me.

1333
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:07,166
Thank you.

1334
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:08,019
My son-in-law.

1335
01:16:08,416 --> 01:16:10,666
You two can leave.

1336
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,708
Vikrant sir.

1337
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:15,128
I'll stay here until Shinu
and Ayesha's wedding.

1338
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:15,791
What?

1339
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:17,405
And anyway, my mother had said..

1340
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,301
..don't come back without
my daughter-in-law.

1341
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:21,458
Balli, serve two more plates.

1342
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:25,208
Ayesha's wedding will be the
grandest wedding in Bangkok.

1343
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:26,666
Kok! Kok!

1344
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:30,666
Okay, consider it done.

1345
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:40,916
Why are you staring at me?

1346
01:16:41,416 --> 01:16:44,291
I am your friend Ganesha. - Friend.

1347
01:16:44,791 --> 01:16:46,031
Is this how you treat a friend?

1348
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:47,287
You're not worried about me.

1349
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:48,583
My life's in a dilemma.

1350
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:50,363
And now you sent Angad here too.

1351
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:51,698
I know. I heard. Don't bore me.

1352
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:55,583
Fine, ring the bell thrice and leave.

1353
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:02,125
"Oh my friend Ganesh, always be with me."

1354
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:05,208
I've seen it five times, please help me.

1355
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:07,791
Shinu.

1356
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,166
Shinu.

1357
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:10,583
Shinu. - Yes.

1358
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:12,644
It happened just like you said. - What?

1359
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:14,250
Bells ringing.

1360
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:17,208
Not once, not twice, but three times.

1361
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:19,666
What? For whom?

1362
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:21,625
It's a boy. - I know it's a boy.

1363
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:23,458
But who's this lucky boy?

1364
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:24,759
Come, I'll show you.

1365
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:27,583
Okay, come.

1366
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:28,583
Where?

1367
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,083
There.

1368
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:32,375
Peter.

1369
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:37,541
Good choice. - No, the other one.

1370
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:38,875
Angad.

1371
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:42,458
Even better choice.

1372
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:46,041
Angad.

1373
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:48,250
Are you sure? - Yes,

1374
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:52,250
But how did it happen?

1375
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:26,625
Sorry, ma'am.

1376
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,833
But, Shinu, don't tell anyone okay.

1377
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:38,708
Just a minute, I'll be back in a minute.

1378
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:40,625
Bappa! Bappa! Bappa! Bappa! Bappa!

1379
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,333
If you keep answering your
devotees prayers like this..

1380
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:46,875
..then, from East to West,
from WeChat to Twitter..

1381
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:50,208
..your followers will keep multiplying.

1382
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:55,208
Ayesha and Angad, what do I say Lord?

1383
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:57,041
Bad idea, Shinu.

1384
01:18:57,541 --> 01:19:00,583
This was just coincidence.

1385
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:01,791
Brother. - What?

1386
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:02,916
Sister-in-law's coming. - Where?

1387
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:06,416
Look ahead. - Where?

1388
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:08,333
Wave at her.

1389
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:10,793
You get nervous every time
you see sister-in-law.

1390
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:12,416
That's why you..

1391
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:14,076
Sister-in-law.. - I'm doing..

1392
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:17,250
Wow, Peter. Early morning massage.

1393
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,166
You really look after Angad a lot.

1394
01:19:19,666 --> 01:19:21,916
Angad's worth everything.

1395
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:24,625
By the way, Peter, even I need a massage.

1396
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:26,416
Shinu, which oil do you like?

1397
01:19:26,916 --> 01:19:28,037
Cashew nut oil, coconut oil.

1398
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:29,291
I've both.

1399
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,271
Peter, I don't take massage from men.

1400
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:32,708
Don't mind.

1401
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:34,208
By the way, who do I ask?

1402
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:35,497
Who do I ask? Who do I ask?

1403
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:39,458
Who do I ask?

1404
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:42,791
Got it.

1405
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:46,250
See you later. See you.

1406
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:52,041
Shinu's going to get a
massage from sister-in-law.

1407
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:54,291
See you. See you.

1408
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:58,291
Brother Angad.

1409
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:02,916
Shinu.

1410
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:10,833
Shinu!

1411
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:29,541
Yes.

1412
01:20:30,041 --> 01:20:33,333
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1413
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:37,333
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1414
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:41,333
Ayesha.

1415
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:43,291
Feeling coy in the water.

1416
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:45,592
People usually swim laps
in a swimming pool..

1417
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,708
..but you were on Angad's lap.

1418
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:50,208
You were getting cozy with Angad.

1419
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:52,041
Shinu, don't trouble me, go.

1420
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:53,625
Okay, okay, I'll go..

1421
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:54,875
..because you don't need me any more.

1422
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:57,541
That's not it. - That's it.

1423
01:20:58,041 --> 01:20:59,791
I say that you go and tell your dad..

1424
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:02,666
..that you love Angad, not me.

1425
01:21:03,166 --> 01:21:04,416
Shinu, you forgot.

1426
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:07,625
You're the one who told me
love's not one way only.

1427
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,583
It's a two way thing.

1428
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:10,583
I said it.

1429
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:11,625
Forget it.

1430
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:15,458
Angad will say 'I love you'
to you in a day or two.

1431
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:19,375
Trust me, I've seen it in his eyes. - Okay.

1432
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,250
But, Shinu. Don't tell anyone. - Sure.

1433
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,510
Promise. - Promise.

1434
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:24,625
Swear? - I swear.

1435
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:26,708
Go, go. - Okay.

1436
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:30,708
Tell your dad.

1437
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:33,750
No, dad. I was wrong about Shinu.

1438
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:35,750
As soon as he saw Vikrant's wealth..

1439
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,610
..he forgot me and was inclined
towards Vikrant's daughter.

1440
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:41,125
What do I do now? You tell me.

1441
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:44,375
Dad, I never understood Angad's love.

1442
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:46,708
I was so wrong.

1443
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:49,250
But now I know he truly loves me.

1444
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,416
I can't find a better boy than him.

1445
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:53,875
How do I say 'I love you' to Angad?

1446
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:58,583
But if he expresses his
love, then I'll say it too.

1447
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:02,166
Angad, I love you too.

1448
01:22:02,666 --> 01:22:06,166
I do.

1449
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:12,625
Where is she?

1450
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:18,708
There she is.

1451
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:47,708
Oh..

1452
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:50,666
Sorry!

1453
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:51,806
I'm sorry again.

1454
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:52,708
"I am bad."

1455
01:22:53,208 --> 01:22:54,666
All okay?

1456
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:57,291
Flirting.

1457
01:22:57,791 --> 01:23:00,166
Shinu, there's something in my eye.

1458
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:01,626
Come here, in the light,

1459
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:05,541
Show me.

1460
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,666
One more.

1461
01:23:09,166 --> 01:23:09,875
One more please..

1462
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:13,458
Balli, I thought it was a gang-war.

1463
01:23:13,958 --> 01:23:17,375
They're children, let's
give them some privacy.

1464
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:22,125
By the way, my son-in-law's
become Emran Hashmi.

1465
01:23:22,625 --> 01:23:23,458
Hashmi. Hashmi.

1466
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:26,750
Come on, let's go. Come on.

1467
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:30,666
Balli, come on.

1468
01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:34,666
Thank you, Shinu.

1469
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:40,041
All okay, Shinu? - Never been better.

1470
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:50,291
Stop it.

1471
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:53,291
Let Ayesha catch her breath.

1472
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:54,875
Shinu.

1473
01:23:55,375 --> 01:24:00,541
Are you going to kill her with your kisses?

1474
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:04,541
Balli, what are you doing?

1475
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:14,166
One Romeo and two Juliet.

1476
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:18,166
Sometimes Ayesha, sometimes Sunaina.

1477
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:34,083
"I am bad."

1478
01:24:34,583 --> 01:24:38,083
"I am bad."

1479
01:24:45,875 --> 01:24:53,875
"Sweetheart, the way you
smile..isn't fair."

1480
01:24:55,625 --> 01:25:03,625
"Putting your lover in
trouble..isn't fair."

1481
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:10,625
"Sweetheart, the way you
smile..isn't fair."

1482
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:16,375
"Putting your lover in
trouble..isn't fair."

1483
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:20,500
"The day I met you..I was just 19."

1484
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,083
"I still remember the
day, it was Valentines."

1485
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:30,250
"Dwelling in my heart and
leaving..isn't fair."

1486
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:34,250
"I am bad."

1487
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:53,750
"Touching the heart and disappearing.."

1488
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:57,583
"..is a bad habit you have."

1489
01:25:58,083 --> 01:26:01,416
"Showing glimpses, and hiding again.."

1490
01:26:01,916 --> 01:26:04,833
"..is a big problem."

1491
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:08,916
"Love is something that happens gradually."

1492
01:26:09,416 --> 01:26:12,916
"Never be hasty and take a risk."

1493
01:26:13,416 --> 01:26:16,375
"I am bad."

1494
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:22,083
"Dancing in skimpy clothes..isn't fair."

1495
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:26,083
"Staring at us with that look..isn't fair."

1496
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:51,583
"I am bad."

1497
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:55,708
"I am bad."

1498
01:26:56,208 --> 01:27:03,458
"I'm starting to slip with you gradually."

1499
01:27:03,958 --> 01:27:10,750
"I'm starting to find my feet
in your arms gradually."

1500
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:14,666
"Control yourself, girls."

1501
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:18,458
"It's unfair to flirt with me openly."

1502
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:26,958
"If you do it, it's right..and
if we do it, it's..unfair."

1503
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:33,833
"In love no one knows what's
right and what's..wrong."

1504
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:37,791
"The day I met you..I was just 19."

1505
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:41,583
"I still remember the
day, it was Valentines."

1506
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:47,833
"Troubling your old lover..isn't fair."

1507
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:51,250
"I am bad."

1508
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:55,250
"Sweetheart, the way you
smile..isn't fair."

1509
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:09,250
"I am bad."

1510
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:26,000
Johnny-Johnny.. - Yes, papa.

1511
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,125
Telling lies. - No papa.

1512
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:31,916
Open the packet.. - Hahahaha.

1513
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:38,958
Johnny filled Nebo with salt.

1514
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:41,916
Johnny, I have many
illegitimate businesses.

1515
01:28:42,416 --> 01:28:42,791
But there's one business which..

1516
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:45,666
..I run under the name of my
daughter Ayesha, fisheries..

1517
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:47,791
..and it's completely legitimate.

1518
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:49,811
And you adulterated with that as well.

1519
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:50,625
Why?

1520
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:52,083
Hail Vikranta.

1521
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:54,458
I swear on my benefactor.

1522
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:56,708
Raju's now a gentleman.

1523
01:28:57,208 --> 01:29:00,541
Balli darling, Johnny loves watching films.

1524
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:02,681
So from today Johnny's no longer Johnny..

1525
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,125
..but Johnny Gaddar (Traitor).

1526
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:09,333
Vikrant, I was thinking..

1527
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:13,458
..if Shinu shoots Johnny Gaddar today..

1528
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:15,833
..then he can join the
family business today.

1529
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:17,875
What a brilliant idea.

1530
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:20,916
Balli darling, you're wicked.

1531
01:29:21,416 --> 01:29:23,416
Okay, son-in-law, your turn.

1532
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:26,125
Sir.. - Yes, shoot him in the head.

1533
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:29,500
But..
- Now take this gun and shoot this a***.

1534
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,750
Shoot him. Shoot him. Shoot him.

1535
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:36,458
You sing wonderful hymns for the Lord..

1536
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:39,166
..and love songs for girls. - Yes.

1537
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,541
Sometimes with Ayesha, sometimes Sunaina..

1538
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:44,958
..you sing really well. - Yes.

1539
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:48,166
Now let's see you play.

1540
01:29:48,666 --> 01:29:50,500
Play.

1541
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,875
Raja Babu.

1542
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:53,000
Dulhe Babu.

1543
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,083
Jamai Raja.

1544
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:57,208
Will you be my friend?

1545
01:29:57,708 --> 01:30:01,208
Shoot him.

1546
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:10,625
Balli.

1547
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:12,791
Son-in-law fired, I'll call you later.

1548
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:16,333
What did you do?

1549
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:18,625
Take it.

1550
01:30:19,125 --> 01:30:19,625
Johnny..

1551
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:20,519
Father-in-law.

1552
01:30:20,666 --> 01:30:21,958
Balli?

1553
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:23,791
Johnny killed Balli.

1554
01:30:24,291 --> 01:30:25,750
Run Milkha run!

1555
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:29,750
Johnny! - Run.

1556
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:49,958
Welcome back.

1557
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:50,978
Welcome back.

1558
01:30:51,291 --> 01:30:55,125
Balli, I am so happy to see you.

1559
01:30:55,625 --> 01:30:57,000
Balli, forgive me.

1560
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:00,333
I couldn't save you from
Johnny Gaddar that day.

1561
01:31:00,833 --> 01:31:02,000
Please forgive me.

1562
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,541
No point, Balli can't speak. - What?

1563
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:06,750
Balli can't speak.

1564
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:11,250
That means..Balli's volume is on mute now.

1565
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:14,666
But..Balli can hear everyone.

1566
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:16,406
He can understand, right Balli.

1567
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:18,291
But he can't speak.

1568
01:31:18,791 --> 01:31:20,911
But how will we know if he
has to go to the bathroom?

1569
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:25,041
With this bell which the doctor
installed on his wheelchair.

1570
01:31:25,541 --> 01:31:28,250
All the best, Balli.

1571
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:29,500
I guess he has to go to the bathroom.

1572
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:30,500
Okay.

1573
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:32,166
I'll take him.

1574
01:31:32,666 --> 01:31:33,166
Me.

1575
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:34,791
Don't worry, Shinu.

1576
01:31:35,291 --> 01:31:37,750
The good news is Balli
can get well anytime.

1577
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:39,833
He can speak, he can get up..

1578
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:41,250
How can he get up..

1579
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:42,458
What?

1580
01:31:42,958 --> 01:31:44,958
I mean how can he get up on his own?

1581
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:46,916
I will help him.

1582
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:48,833
Just like sweetmeats have 'Mewa'.

1583
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:50,666
In dancing there's Prabhu Deva.

1584
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:54,291
Similarly, I will look after Balli.

1585
01:31:54,791 --> 01:31:56,083
Wow.

1586
01:31:56,583 --> 01:32:00,083
He's leaving.

1587
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:14,041
Balli darling, I found
Johnny to get you revenge.

1588
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:15,041
Saved.

1589
01:32:15,416 --> 01:32:17,666
Father-in-law, Johnny's in the yellow drum.

1590
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:20,291
Yellow-yellow, he's a dirty fellow.

1591
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:23,958
Dirty fellow?

1592
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:25,000
Saved?

1593
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,125
Dadzu..

1594
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:28,665
What game are you playing?

1595
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:31,541
We're playing 'Shoot the drum'.

1596
01:32:32,041 --> 01:32:33,291
Red is my favorite color.

1597
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:35,583
Okay, red is your favorite color. Try it.

1598
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:37,483
Sir, she can shoot too? - She does.

1599
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:41,458
Watch.

1600
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:43,678
Hey he is in blue.

1601
01:32:44,083 --> 01:32:47,583
Hail Vikranta.

1602
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:53,250
Dad.

1603
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:54,708
Myself Prasad.

1604
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:56,708
What were you stuck in?

1605
01:32:57,208 --> 01:33:00,000
'Haathi Mere Saathi.'

1606
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,220
Sir, they are my mom-dad. - I know. I know.

1607
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:03,416
I invited them.

1608
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:04,833
You two are getting married, remember.

1609
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:06,458
He forgot. He forgot.

1610
01:33:06,958 --> 01:33:08,458
But nothing to worry about, relax.

1611
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:10,916
Relax.

1612
01:33:11,416 --> 01:33:13,500
That day you jumped from
the boat and escaped.

1613
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,500
Today my in-laws saved you.

1614
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,458
But, the day my daughter gets married..

1615
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:20,791
..my bullet will pierce his heart.

1616
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:22,916
It will. It will. It will.

1617
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:26,708
Johnny, you should've listened to them.
- Take him out. Take him out.

1618
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:27,750
Take him out.

1619
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:30,458
Mom-dad, this is..
- This is Ayesha, my daughter.

1620
01:33:30,958 --> 01:33:31,750
Dear, greet them.

1621
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:33,375
Sorry.

1622
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:36,791
Hello. - Not that much.

1623
01:33:37,291 --> 01:33:38,000
Simple people.

1624
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,958
Thank you - Hello.

1625
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:42,708
What kind of a house is this?

1626
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:44,608
Instead of the veneration platter..

1627
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:47,000
..daughter-in-law welcomed us with a gun.

1628
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:48,958
They are dangerous people.

1629
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:50,666
Listen, let's go back.

1630
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:55,250
Sunaina, my parents.

1631
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:57,833
Hello. - It's okay, dear.

1632
01:33:58,333 --> 01:33:59,291
Who is she?

1633
01:33:59,791 --> 01:34:01,750
She's the one I want to marry.

1634
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:03,041
So who was that?

1635
01:34:03,541 --> 01:34:07,041
She wants to marry me.

1636
01:34:13,291 --> 01:34:15,583
Brother, after getting
suspended life is beautiful.

1637
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:20,041
Only rest.

1638
01:34:20,541 --> 01:34:24,041
Rose?

1639
01:34:28,291 --> 01:34:31,291
Brother.

1640
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:32,291
What is it?

1641
01:34:32,791 --> 01:34:36,291
Sister-in-law.

1642
01:34:43,208 --> 01:34:44,368
Why do you always lose, baby?

1643
01:34:44,666 --> 01:34:46,208
It's cheating.

1644
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:49,791
Losing in love is a sign of manliness.

1645
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:54,125
Who is it?

1646
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:55,833
He's up.

1647
01:34:56,333 --> 01:34:58,458
Come on.

1648
01:34:58,958 --> 01:35:00,666
Balli, what happened?

1649
01:35:01,166 --> 01:35:04,666
Balli, take me there.

1650
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:12,291
Sunaina.

1651
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:14,000
Sunaina.

1652
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,061
Where are you?

1653
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:17,375
You in my room?

1654
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:23,041
And that too so late..
- Ayesha, are you ok.

1655
01:35:23,541 --> 01:35:25,750
Vikrant is coming.
- Don't worry, I'll take care.

1656
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:27,051
Go, go, go. - Where?

1657
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,333
Ayesha open the door.

1658
01:35:28,833 --> 01:35:29,750
Move, move.

1659
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:30,750
Dad.

1660
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:32,836
Someone is in the house
I'll find and shoot him.

1661
01:35:33,125 --> 01:35:34,250
Anybody in the bathroom.
- Dad, what's going on?

1662
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:35,500
What happened?

1663
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,601
Balli's trying to explain by whistling..

1664
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:38,458
..that someone's in the house.

1665
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:39,625
Anybody in your bedroom? - No.

1666
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:41,605
Father-in-law, as long as I am here..

1667
01:35:41,791 --> 01:35:42,625
..how can anyone dare to
get in Ayesha's room?

1668
01:35:43,125 --> 01:35:44,375
I mean who can dare too..

1669
01:35:44,875 --> 01:35:46,416
..enter my future wife's room?

1670
01:35:46,916 --> 01:35:48,458
Who is it?

1671
01:35:48,958 --> 01:35:49,458
I'll check.

1672
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:50,678
Who could be here?

1673
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:53,916
Who is it?

1674
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:56,333
No one's there.

1675
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:57,433
No one's there.

1676
01:35:57,833 --> 01:35:59,113
There's no one inside. - No one.

1677
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:01,166
Let's look here too.

1678
01:36:01,666 --> 01:36:02,546
No one's there, Balli.

1679
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,041
I'll check in this cupboard.

1680
01:36:05,541 --> 01:36:07,416
Johnny.. - Gaddar.

1681
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:09,166
Walker. Walker. Walker.

1682
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:10,583
I am sleepy.

1683
01:36:11,083 --> 01:36:11,875
Sir. - Yes.

1684
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:14,833
Sir, you looked everywhere,
check the bathroom too.

1685
01:36:15,333 --> 01:36:16,833
Peter, you..

1686
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,625
Father-in-law, I'll check.

1687
01:36:19,125 --> 01:36:19,916
Shoot.

1688
01:36:20,416 --> 01:36:23,916
Not me.

1689
01:36:26,458 --> 01:36:27,166
Shinu you..

1690
01:36:27,666 --> 01:36:28,546
Should I tell Vikrant?

1691
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,333
"I am bad."

1692
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:32,708
Father-in-law. - Yes, shoot him.

1693
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:34,009
There's no one here.

1694
01:36:34,416 --> 01:36:35,958
And Angad isn't here.

1695
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:38,125
I need a drink now, Balli follow me.

1696
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:39,706
Yes why no. - Not with you.

1697
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:41,458
Okay.

1698
01:36:41,958 --> 01:36:43,958
Angad's ready in the bathtub inside.

1699
01:36:44,458 --> 01:36:45,541
Shinu.

1700
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:48,083
He'll definitely tell
you his feelings today.

1701
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:49,291
And listen.

1702
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:53,291
If he doesn't then shoot him.

1703
01:36:57,541 --> 01:36:58,250
Saved.

1704
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:01,166
Come on hurry up.

1705
01:37:01,666 --> 01:37:02,916
Come on hurry up.

1706
01:37:03,416 --> 01:37:04,056
Everyone's gone.

1707
01:37:04,541 --> 01:37:08,041
You can come out now.

1708
01:37:11,916 --> 01:37:15,416
Thank you.

1709
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:20,666
Thank you, ma'am.

1710
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:24,875
I'm leaving now.

1711
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:29,458
I really like you, thank you.

1712
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:33,458
Angad.

1713
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,916
Shinu. Only three days left for our wedding.
- I know.

1714
01:37:38,416 --> 01:37:40,666
And do you know what Angad
said to me last night?

1715
01:37:41,166 --> 01:37:41,916
What?

1716
01:37:42,416 --> 01:37:44,583
Thank you, ma'am. I really like you.

1717
01:37:45,083 --> 01:37:46,458
So that's love.

1718
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:47,558
Tell your dad..

1719
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,708
Wait.

1720
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:52,416
Do you like Katrina? - By God.

1721
01:37:52,916 --> 01:37:54,916
Do you like Vidya? - Ooh la la.

1722
01:37:55,416 --> 01:37:58,666
Do you like Sachin? - Of course.

1723
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:00,833
You like all of them. - Yes.

1724
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:05,291
But, Shinu, do you love any of them.

1725
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:08,958
Similarly, Angad likes me
but he doesn't love me.

1726
01:38:09,458 --> 01:38:10,541
But, Ayesha.. - As long as he doesn't say..

1727
01:38:11,041 --> 01:38:14,458
..those three magical words,
I can't tell dad about him.

1728
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:16,666
Ayesha. Ayesha.

1729
01:38:17,166 --> 01:38:18,750
My dear friends.

1730
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:22,083
I am standing here raising a
toast for my dear son-in-law.

1731
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:24,708
What do I say to this old man now?

1732
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:27,666
But before that I would like some of you..

1733
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:29,750
..to say some nice things about him.

1734
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:33,750
And I would like to request
Shinu's father first..

1735
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:37,291
..because he's his off-spring after all.

1736
01:38:37,791 --> 01:38:39,458
Cheers!

1737
01:38:39,958 --> 01:38:40,666
Cheers!

1738
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:42,583
What's going on.

1739
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:46,000
25 years ago, there were
no Ipods or Ipills.

1740
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,708
And Shinu was born.

1741
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:49,916
Why was he born? Now I know why.

1742
01:38:50,416 --> 01:38:54,458
So that he can be Singhal sir's son-in-law.

1743
01:38:54,958 --> 01:38:57,458
Cheers! - Cheers!

1744
01:38:57,958 --> 01:39:03,958
You know.. Shinu has made me
realize who my true love is.

1745
01:39:04,458 --> 01:39:06,375
She's talking about you.

1746
01:39:06,875 --> 01:39:14,875
Shinu has made me realize..
Who my true love is.

1747
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:16,750
She's talking about me too.

1748
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:20,833
A toast for the son-in-law
of the Singhal family.

1749
01:39:21,333 --> 01:39:22,458
Cheers.

1750
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:24,583
I want to say something too.

1751
01:39:25,083 --> 01:39:28,583
What?

1752
01:39:34,958 --> 01:39:35,833
Balli can speak.

1753
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:37,733
Balli can speak. - Speak up, Balli.

1754
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:39,541
Balli can speak.

1755
01:39:40,041 --> 01:39:41,208
Balli can speak.

1756
01:39:41,708 --> 01:39:45,458
Speak up, Balli. - Speak up, Balli.

1757
01:39:45,958 --> 01:39:48,333
Just like every double-cross is deceit.

1758
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:51,125
Deceit.

1759
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:53,625
Just like every boundary is a four.

1760
01:39:54,125 --> 01:39:56,375
Four.

1761
01:39:56,875 --> 01:40:01,458
Similarly.. there's a right moment to..
- Speak up.

1762
01:40:01,958 --> 01:40:03,541
What words. What emotions.

1763
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:05,333
Time for double celebrations.

1764
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:06,916
Balli can speak.

1765
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:08,750
B for Balli. B for Bubbly.

1766
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:10,750
Let's have some champagne please.

1767
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:12,833
Man has awakened.

1768
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:17,125
Man has awakened. - Johnny.

1769
01:40:17,625 --> 01:40:19,000
Forget it, buddy.

1770
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,020
Balli. - Dad.

1771
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:21,000
Dad.

1772
01:40:21,291 --> 01:40:23,208
Dad, it's a party. - Oh yeah.

1773
01:40:23,708 --> 01:40:24,458
Please dad.

1774
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:28,458
Johnny, Balli will decide your fate today.

1775
01:40:28,958 --> 01:40:29,541
Let's party.

1776
01:40:30,041 --> 01:40:30,541
Let's party.

1777
01:40:30,958 --> 01:40:32,125
Let's pop some champagne.

1778
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:36,125
"I am bad."

1779
01:41:19,458 --> 01:41:22,958
Yes, Balli. Speak up.

1780
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:29,166
Balli, what is this?

1781
01:41:30,583 --> 01:41:32,833
Balli, words no whistle.

1782
01:41:33,333 --> 01:41:34,213
No, I don't like this.

1783
01:41:34,708 --> 01:41:37,458
I am eager to hear your voice, come on.

1784
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:42,458
Shut your mouth or I'll really shoot you.

1785
01:41:42,958 --> 01:41:44,000
Balli can't speak.

1786
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:47,000
Balli you dumb man.

1787
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:50,958
Balli, sometimes whistle or bell.

1788
01:41:51,458 --> 01:41:53,541
You gave a moment of happiness..

1789
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:55,958
..and went back to mute mode again.

1790
01:41:56,458 --> 01:41:58,666
Why?

1791
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:02,666
You're missing your sister.

1792
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:13,250
Here you go..

1793
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:15,630
Peter, a man usually holds
his head like this..

1794
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:18,333
..when the girl slips out of his hand.

1795
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:22,333
Now I will marry Sunaina
in front of your eyes.

1796
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:30,333
Have you said 'I love you' to Sunaina?
- No.

1797
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:31,283
No.

1798
01:42:31,291 --> 01:42:32,875
Has she said 'I love you' to you?

1799
01:42:33,375 --> 01:42:34,041
Never. - Never.

1800
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:37,083
I say first go say 'I love you' to her.

1801
01:42:37,583 --> 01:42:38,223
Then we'll talk.

1802
01:42:38,708 --> 01:42:39,208
Okay.

1803
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:42,750
See you later.

1804
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:45,791
I'll say 'I love you' to Sunaina today.

1805
01:42:46,291 --> 01:42:47,958
You can't do it, sir.

1806
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:50,625
Whose side are you on?

1807
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:56,125
I am on your side, sir.

1808
01:42:56,625 --> 01:42:59,458
Sunaina.

1809
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:01,291
Sunaina.

1810
01:43:01,791 --> 01:43:05,291
I am right here. - I am here too.

1811
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:18,416
Sunaina, you know I am
a bit weak in romance.

1812
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:22,166
But today..

1813
01:43:22,666 --> 01:43:26,708
Today I want to tell you something..

1814
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:30,625
..which I never told anyone. - What?

1815
01:43:31,125 --> 01:43:32,583
Is she Sunaina?

1816
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:35,375
Yes, its her.

1817
01:43:35,875 --> 01:43:39,375
Sunaina.

1818
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:42,875
Sunaina.

1819
01:43:43,375 --> 01:43:44,416
Sunaina.

1820
01:43:44,916 --> 01:43:45,875
Let go.

1821
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:49,875
Sunaina.

1822
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:57,000
Sunaina.

1823
01:44:05,666 --> 01:44:08,666
I can't control myself.

1824
01:44:09,166 --> 01:44:12,666
I just want to say.. I love you.

1825
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:29,000
And if you want to say something to me..

1826
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:33,000
..then, I am waiting inside.

1827
01:44:39,666 --> 01:44:41,708
Angad, there's just one
thing I want to say now.

1828
01:44:42,208 --> 01:44:43,041
I love you too.

1829
01:44:43,541 --> 01:44:47,041
I love you too.

1830
01:44:54,708 --> 01:44:58,208
"Fire."

1831
01:45:17,125 --> 01:45:20,166
"For your love.. I've announced."

1832
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:24,166
"For your sake.. I bounced the
hearts of all the girls."

1833
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:34,583
"For your love.. I've announced."

1834
01:45:35,083 --> 01:45:38,208
"For your sake.. I bounced the
hearts of all the girls."

1835
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:41,666
"I feel restless, but can't understand."

1836
01:45:42,166 --> 01:45:43,583
"I stay awake.."

1837
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:45,363
"..how do you sleep without me?"

1838
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:48,791
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1839
01:45:49,291 --> 01:45:52,458
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1840
01:45:52,958 --> 01:45:56,083
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1841
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:59,875
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1842
01:46:00,375 --> 01:46:01,833
"I stay awake.."

1843
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:05,833
"..how do you sleep without me?"

1844
01:46:11,125 --> 01:46:14,416
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1845
01:46:14,916 --> 01:46:17,750
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1846
01:46:18,250 --> 01:46:21,250
"From 11 o'clock its become 12 o'clock."

1847
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:25,208
"Everyone's asleep." "But
my eyes look for you."

1848
01:46:25,708 --> 01:46:28,833
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1849
01:46:29,333 --> 01:46:32,375
"I've counted 1600 stars."

1850
01:46:32,875 --> 01:46:36,208
"I keep awake, I wonder
how you fall asleep."

1851
01:46:36,708 --> 01:46:40,208
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1852
01:46:47,916 --> 01:46:50,958
"Gradually our love has progressed."

1853
01:46:51,458 --> 01:46:54,958
"My ties with you have strengthened."

1854
01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:01,958
"When I saw you, stars
glittered in my heart."

1855
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:05,250
"You turned out to be my lucky girl."

1856
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:07,000
"By God I say."

1857
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:08,791
"I want to be with you."

1858
01:47:09,291 --> 01:47:12,458
"I can't stand any distance from you."

1859
01:47:12,958 --> 01:47:16,375
"You don't come to meet
me, and I nearly die."

1860
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:18,250
"Skips a beat."

1861
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:22,250
"Skips a beat."

1862
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:30,583
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1863
01:47:31,083 --> 01:47:34,583
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1864
01:47:49,166 --> 01:47:52,666
"Fire."

1865
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:07,291
"All the days of the week passed some how."

1866
01:48:07,791 --> 01:48:11,291
"When the seventh day came, I stretched."

1867
01:48:15,166 --> 01:48:18,375
"7:30 in the evening my
desires are on a high."

1868
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:21,458
"By 8:30 I get restless."

1869
01:48:21,958 --> 01:48:25,208
"Don't waste time, come to me."

1870
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:29,125
"I waited a long time, I
can't wait any longer."

1871
01:48:29,625 --> 01:48:32,750
"Anymore delay makes my heart yearn."

1872
01:48:33,250 --> 01:48:34,583
"Yearn."

1873
01:48:35,083 --> 01:48:38,583
"Yearn."

1874
01:48:40,625 --> 01:48:43,458
"One, two, three, four."

1875
01:48:43,958 --> 01:48:47,041
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1876
01:48:47,541 --> 01:48:50,958
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1877
01:48:51,458 --> 01:48:52,708
"I stay awake.."

1878
01:48:53,208 --> 01:48:54,488
"..how do you sleep without me?"

1879
01:48:54,708 --> 01:48:58,208
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1880
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:06,166
"Sleep. Sleep. Sleep."

1881
01:49:06,666 --> 01:49:07,958
"I cannot sleep."

1882
01:49:08,458 --> 01:49:12,708
Oh sorry.

1883
01:49:13,208 --> 01:49:15,916
"Saturday night I can't sleep."

1884
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:22,000
Shinu. Whenever a daughter's born..

1885
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:24,333
..the father always hates the boy..

1886
01:49:24,833 --> 01:49:26,458
..who will steal his princess.

1887
01:49:26,958 --> 01:49:29,625
But there can't be anyone
more fortunate than me.

1888
01:49:30,125 --> 01:49:34,041
Because a boy like you is going
to steal my daughter away.

1889
01:49:34,541 --> 01:49:36,583
Son-in-law, today I am assured..

1890
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:39,291
..that you will love Ayesha more than me.

1891
01:49:39,791 --> 01:49:41,916
And I like that. - Thank you.

1892
01:49:42,416 --> 01:49:45,541
That father is blessed whose
top you have come out from.

1893
01:49:46,041 --> 01:49:48,208
Come out. Come out.

1894
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:50,250
No, no, no.

1895
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:52,250
Yes.

1896
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:53,416
I love you.

1897
01:49:53,916 --> 01:49:54,916
I love you my son-in-law.

1898
01:49:55,166 --> 01:49:56,625
You're the best. You're the best.

1899
01:49:57,125 --> 01:49:58,458
Father-in-law.

1900
01:49:58,958 --> 01:50:01,916
The love that you gave
in the last 10 days..

1901
01:50:02,416 --> 01:50:05,458
..is more than what my
parents gave me in 25 years.

1902
01:50:05,958 --> 01:50:11,125
See..so easily he's
humiliating his parents.

1903
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:13,166
But it's important to ask Ayesha..

1904
01:50:13,666 --> 01:50:15,106
..who makes bells ring in her heart?

1905
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:16,875
Why ask her?

1906
01:50:17,375 --> 01:50:19,495
You made bells ring in all our hearts.
- That's true.

1907
01:50:19,708 --> 01:50:20,375
Dad, wait.

1908
01:50:20,875 --> 01:50:22,125
There she is.

1909
01:50:22,625 --> 01:50:26,083
Today I want to say what's in my heart.

1910
01:50:26,583 --> 01:50:29,625
Love at first sight is not always right.

1911
01:50:30,125 --> 01:50:33,750
Thank God I got these 10 days.

1912
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:38,666
Because now I know who
my true love really is.

1913
01:50:39,166 --> 01:50:42,666
I love..

1914
01:50:44,541 --> 01:50:48,041
Shinu!

1915
01:50:51,208 --> 01:50:54,708
And I am so lucky I am marrying him.

1916
01:50:58,958 --> 01:51:02,458
Sorry, Shinu!

1917
01:51:21,958 --> 01:51:25,333
God, you've been my
friend since I was a kid.

1918
01:51:25,833 --> 01:51:27,553
Sometimes as Krishna, sometimes as Christ..

1919
01:51:27,833 --> 01:51:30,125
..or as Ganesh.

1920
01:51:30,625 --> 01:51:33,291
You've always supported
me in different forms.

1921
01:51:33,791 --> 01:51:38,291
The first time I fell
in love You blessed me.

1922
01:51:38,791 --> 01:51:43,916
But today..I'm going to lose my love.

1923
01:51:44,416 --> 01:51:45,791
I need You the most today.

1924
01:51:46,291 --> 01:51:51,500
And You aren't helping me.

1925
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,280
Why aren't You saying something?

1926
01:51:53,583 --> 01:51:53,625
Otherwise all the time you keep saying..

1927
01:51:54,125 --> 01:51:55,365
..Shinu do this, Shinu do that.

1928
01:51:55,541 --> 01:52:00,083
No one's going to help you today.

1929
01:52:00,583 --> 01:52:03,541
Not even your God.

1930
01:52:04,041 --> 01:52:07,750
You made bells ring in
Ayesha's heart for me.

1931
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:13,125
But..we're going to play the
trumpet on your wedding.

1932
01:52:13,625 --> 01:52:16,250
Thanks to you, Ayesha fell in love with me.

1933
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:17,950
And taking advantage of that..

1934
01:52:18,208 --> 01:52:21,041
..I told her that I love her.

1935
01:52:21,541 --> 01:52:27,041
After that the poor girl was
ready to say anything I wanted.

1936
01:52:27,541 --> 01:52:32,958
She took your name in front
of Vikrant because of me.

1937
01:52:33,458 --> 01:52:37,333
Knock-knock.

1938
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:38,708
No?

1939
01:52:39,208 --> 01:52:40,500
Forget it.

1940
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,480
Why play 'knock-knock' with someone..

1941
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:46,000
..who's already been knocked out.

1942
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:03,750
Come in.

1943
01:53:08,666 --> 01:53:10,306
Will you knock before entering the room..

1944
01:53:10,416 --> 01:53:12,208
..after we're married?

1945
01:53:12,708 --> 01:53:15,375
We won't step out of the
room in the first place.

1946
01:53:15,875 --> 01:53:17,315
Every night will be a wedding night.

1947
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:20,333
But before you are climbing the Mt.
Everest..

1948
01:53:20,833 --> 01:53:22,083
..you need to go Nepal.

1949
01:53:22,583 --> 01:53:23,958
Wedding night is too far-fetched..

1950
01:53:24,458 --> 01:53:29,375
..you haven't even kissed me yet.

1951
01:53:29,875 --> 01:53:32,333
You want me to kiss you.

1952
01:53:32,833 --> 01:53:34,166
Of course, Angu.

1953
01:53:34,666 --> 01:53:39,208
Lord hasn't created these
lips only for lipstick.

1954
01:53:39,708 --> 01:53:40,625
Peter.

1955
01:53:41,125 --> 01:53:42,291
Yes. - I must admit.

1956
01:53:42,791 --> 01:53:44,708
What?

1957
01:53:45,208 --> 01:53:46,416
What happened?

1958
01:53:46,916 --> 01:53:49,458
Your boss..defeated me.

1959
01:53:49,958 --> 01:53:51,958
Oh my, God.

1960
01:53:52,458 --> 01:53:55,625
I can't believe this.

1961
01:53:56,125 --> 01:53:57,958
Let's congratulate him.

1962
01:53:58,458 --> 01:54:00,833
You've a big heart. - Thanks, dude.

1963
01:54:01,333 --> 01:54:02,573
You're so sporting. - Let's go.

1964
01:54:02,833 --> 01:54:08,375
I haven't even touched any
girl, forget kissing her.

1965
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:13,541
So touch me and kiss me too.

1966
01:54:14,041 --> 01:54:17,291
Come on, Angad, even the
lights are switched off now.

1967
01:54:17,791 --> 01:54:19,125
Don't waste time.

1968
01:54:19,625 --> 01:54:23,125
Yes, good idea.

1969
01:54:26,583 --> 01:54:28,458
Peter.

1970
01:54:28,958 --> 01:54:31,583
Angad, you kissed Peter.

1971
01:54:32,083 --> 01:54:34,375
Angad?

1972
01:54:34,875 --> 01:54:35,875
Don't tell anyone.

1973
01:54:36,375 --> 01:54:37,125
What?

1974
01:54:37,625 --> 01:54:39,541
Sometimes you shoot me,
sometimes you kiss me.

1975
01:54:40,041 --> 01:54:42,625
This relation is getting too complicated.

1976
01:54:43,125 --> 01:54:44,285
I was going to kiss Sunaina..

1977
01:54:44,333 --> 01:54:45,373
..where did you come from?

1978
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,750
No, no, I think Sunaina
came between you and Peter.

1979
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:48,750
No, no, no.

1980
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:50,416
Sunaina, I was going to kiss you.

1981
01:54:50,916 --> 01:54:52,250
I really love you.

1982
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,083
I don't know where he came from?

1983
01:54:54,583 --> 01:54:56,416
I was nervous, I never kissed anyone.

1984
01:54:56,916 --> 01:54:58,416
That's all.

1985
01:54:58,916 --> 01:55:00,750
Don't worry, Angad. I'll teach you.

1986
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:03,625
Because kissing is an art.

1987
01:55:04,125 --> 01:55:05,206
So I want to learn the art.

1988
01:55:05,666 --> 01:55:08,083
Okay, so first hold the
gorgeous lady's beautiful hand.

1989
01:55:08,583 --> 01:55:10,208
Okay.

1990
01:55:10,708 --> 01:55:11,875
Who's the teacher? - You.

1991
01:55:12,375 --> 01:55:12,875
Correct.

1992
01:55:13,375 --> 01:55:15,216
First hold the gorgeous
lady's beautiful hand.

1993
01:55:15,666 --> 01:55:17,750
Twirl her around.

1994
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:20,125
Pull her closer. - Okay.

1995
01:55:20,625 --> 01:55:21,250
Bend over.

1996
01:55:21,750 --> 01:55:24,250
You got it.. - And..

1997
01:55:24,750 --> 01:55:28,375
"Fire."

1998
01:55:28,875 --> 01:55:30,541
I can't believe this.

1999
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:32,916
See how Shinu kissed sister-in-law.

2000
01:55:33,416 --> 01:55:35,625
Angad, learn something.

2001
01:55:36,125 --> 01:55:36,750
One more time.. One more time..

2002
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:40,750
You..

2003
01:55:47,375 --> 01:55:50,875
Shinu.

2004
01:55:58,916 --> 01:56:00,458
Mother-in-law.

2005
01:56:00,958 --> 01:56:02,238
Save me from this white gorilla.

2006
01:56:02,583 --> 01:56:04,833
You animal, why are you
troubling my son-in-law?

2007
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:07,791
Mother-in-law, Angad kissed Peter.

2008
01:56:08,291 --> 01:56:09,451
And now he's furious with me.

2009
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:11,583
Is it my fault that I
caught them in the act?

2010
01:56:12,083 --> 01:56:13,708
I always doubted these two.

2011
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:16,288
Especially this midget.
- No, no, no, that's not it.

2012
01:56:16,541 --> 01:56:18,875
I'll tell you what happened. - Okay.

2013
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:20,666
Shinu said to Angad that..

2014
01:56:21,166 --> 01:56:26,250
..kissing your future bride is an art.

2015
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:27,666
So what did you say?

2016
01:56:28,166 --> 01:56:29,846
I said I want to learn the art of kissing.

2017
01:56:30,208 --> 01:56:33,083
He did. - So what did you teach him, Shinu?

2018
01:56:33,583 --> 01:56:35,166
So I displayed my art.

2019
01:56:35,666 --> 01:56:36,458
How is that?

2020
01:56:36,958 --> 01:56:37,558
It's like this.

2021
01:56:37,916 --> 01:56:39,458
I held Sunaina's beautiful hand.

2022
01:56:39,958 --> 01:56:40,958
Twirled her around.

2023
01:56:41,458 --> 01:56:43,125
Pulled her close.

2024
01:56:43,625 --> 01:56:44,916
Bent over.

2025
01:56:45,416 --> 01:56:47,375
What did I do next, Peter. - Kissed her.

2026
01:56:47,875 --> 01:56:48,708
Yes.

2027
01:56:49,208 --> 01:56:52,041
"Fire."

2028
01:56:52,541 --> 01:56:53,791
That's the sequel of Kiss.

2029
01:56:54,291 --> 01:56:56,125
After Krish 2 this is Kiss 2.

2030
01:56:56,625 --> 01:56:58,458
Shall I do it again?

2031
01:56:58,958 --> 01:57:02,458
Hey.

2032
01:57:04,333 --> 01:57:07,833
Shinu.

2033
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:12,916
Stop, or I will shoot.

2034
01:57:13,416 --> 01:57:14,625
Shinu.. - What happened?

2035
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:16,726
Why is he running after you like a bull?

2036
01:57:16,958 --> 01:57:18,541
Nothing..

2037
01:57:19,041 --> 01:57:23,791
Dad, I said to him that kissing
your future bride is an art.

2038
01:57:24,291 --> 01:57:25,500
Correct. You're right.

2039
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:26,840
And what did you say?

2040
01:57:27,166 --> 01:57:29,007
I said I want to learn
this art, I don't know.

2041
01:57:29,208 --> 01:57:30,688
Yes, Angad said he wants to learn it.

2042
01:57:31,041 --> 01:57:32,321
Correct. - Shinu will teach you.

2043
01:57:32,625 --> 01:57:34,375
Come. Come, Shinu.

2044
01:57:34,875 --> 01:57:36,541
Isn't this the same art I taught you?

2045
01:57:37,041 --> 01:57:37,541
Yes, dad.

2046
01:57:37,833 --> 01:57:40,208
This is the same art you
taught Sharmila aunty..

2047
01:57:40,708 --> 01:57:42,125
..after mother went to the market.

2048
01:57:42,625 --> 01:57:44,000
Shut up. He's lying.

2049
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:47,500
You know that you taught me this art.

2050
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,166
Naughty. Naughty.

2051
01:57:49,666 --> 01:57:51,507
First hold the gorgeous
lady's beautiful hand.

2052
01:57:51,833 --> 01:57:53,125
Twirl her around.

2053
01:57:53,625 --> 01:57:54,708
Pull her closer.

2054
01:57:55,208 --> 01:57:56,125
Bend over.

2055
01:57:56,625 --> 01:57:58,750
And then..

2056
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:01,416
"Fire."

2057
01:58:01,916 --> 01:58:06,583
After Krish 3 this is Kiss 3.
- Shut up, Peter.

2058
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:09,375
Balli, save me from him.

2059
01:58:09,875 --> 01:58:12,666
Balli, this rascal kissed
my bride three times.

2060
01:58:13,166 --> 01:58:14,416
Me?

2061
01:58:14,916 --> 01:58:16,250
Yes, I did. - You..

2062
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:17,833
Do you want to see it?

2063
01:58:18,333 --> 01:58:19,750
Stop ringing the bell.

2064
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:23,041
I learnt all I had to. I can teach you too.

2065
01:58:23,541 --> 01:58:25,382
First hold the gorgeous
lady's beautiful hand.

2066
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:26,708
Twirl her around.

2067
01:58:27,208 --> 01:58:28,125
Pull her closer.

2068
01:58:28,625 --> 01:58:29,125
Bend over.

2069
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:31,666
And then..- Hold on.

2070
01:58:32,166 --> 01:58:36,750
Actually..I feel shy..

2071
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:40,750
Close your eyes, please. - Yes.

2072
01:59:22,625 --> 01:59:23,750
Dad..

2073
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:26,166
Father-in-law, see.

2074
01:59:26,666 --> 01:59:30,666
That rascal kissed my wife
one day before our wedding.

2075
01:59:31,166 --> 01:59:31,833
He kissed her.

2076
01:59:32,333 --> 01:59:32,833
Kissed her.

2077
01:59:33,291 --> 01:59:35,583
Kill him. - I will kill him..

2078
01:59:36,083 --> 01:59:37,541
I will kill you. - Hold on.

2079
01:59:38,041 --> 01:59:41,000
Come here.

2080
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:44,708
Even though you know my daughter's going to marry him..
- No. No.

2081
01:59:45,208 --> 01:59:48,583
..how dare you do such a thing?

2082
01:59:49,083 --> 01:59:52,500
Dad, I love him. - What?

2083
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,666
Me.

2084
01:59:57,166 --> 01:59:58,625
You saw that?

2085
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:00,365
He's not the right boy for you.

2086
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:02,351
He's corrupt, he's a Rowdy, he's a goon.

2087
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:03,416
Goon. Goon.

2088
02:00:03,916 --> 02:00:04,750
Oh, God.

2089
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:08,166
Dad, are you talking
about Angad or yourself?

2090
02:00:08,666 --> 02:00:11,375
Because even you are all these things.

2091
02:00:11,875 --> 02:00:16,916
They say every girl looks for
her dad in her future husband.

2092
02:00:17,416 --> 02:00:19,708
That's why I've chosen Angad.

2093
02:00:20,208 --> 02:00:22,416
And that's my final decision.

2094
02:00:22,916 --> 02:00:26,375
But..

2095
02:00:26,875 --> 02:00:28,000
How will I explain Shinu?

2096
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:31,416
Explain him. Explain him. Shut up!

2097
02:00:31,916 --> 02:00:33,333
Son-in-law.

2098
02:00:33,833 --> 02:00:34,458
Son-in-law.

2099
02:00:34,958 --> 02:00:39,125
No, son-in-law.

2100
02:00:39,625 --> 02:00:41,750
Greeting!

2101
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:42,750
Son-in-law.

2102
02:00:43,083 --> 02:00:43,958
He's calling you.

2103
02:00:44,458 --> 02:00:45,658
Let's go there, in the corner.

2104
02:00:45,791 --> 02:00:46,666
Corner. Corner.

2105
02:00:47,166 --> 02:00:50,666
But why corner?

2106
02:00:56,625 --> 02:00:57,905
I think this time it'll be done.

2107
02:00:58,375 --> 02:01:00,458
God's being unfair with me..

2108
02:01:00,958 --> 02:01:02,198
..just like I was with Sunaina.

2109
02:01:02,625 --> 02:01:03,458
But what happened?

2110
02:01:03,958 --> 02:01:08,041
She loves Angad and wants to marry him.
- No!

2111
02:01:08,541 --> 02:01:09,625
No.

2112
02:01:10,125 --> 02:01:11,541
If I don't get married..

2113
02:01:12,041 --> 02:01:15,041
..then how will I face anyone, sir.

2114
02:01:15,541 --> 02:01:17,041
Who will marry me?

2115
02:01:17,541 --> 02:01:19,666
When my parents pass through
the lanes of Ooty..

2116
02:01:20,166 --> 02:01:22,086
..people will say, "look
there go the parents.."

2117
02:01:22,125 --> 02:01:24,208
"..of the unmarried son".

2118
02:01:24,708 --> 02:01:25,750
He's overdoing it.

2119
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:28,250
You became a widower after getting married.

2120
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:31,333
But you made me a widower
without getting married.

2121
02:01:31,833 --> 02:01:33,708
Widower. Widower. Widower.

2122
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:36,291
Dad.

2123
02:01:36,791 --> 02:01:39,208
He can make the entire world widower.

2124
02:01:39,708 --> 02:01:41,375
If I don't do as my daughter says..

2125
02:01:41,875 --> 02:01:43,208
..then I will lose her forever.

2126
02:01:43,708 --> 02:01:45,228
My daughter's life lies in your hands.

2127
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:46,625
Hands! Hands!

2128
02:01:47,125 --> 02:01:49,166
Fine, sir. Fine.

2129
02:01:49,666 --> 02:01:53,958
I even sacrificed my love,
my Sunaina for you.

2130
02:01:54,458 --> 02:01:57,791
So once again, for your happiness..

2131
02:01:58,291 --> 02:01:59,166
..I let Ayesha go.

2132
02:01:59,666 --> 02:02:03,166
"I am bad."

2133
02:02:05,375 --> 02:02:07,666
Let go of my hand, sir.

2134
02:02:08,166 --> 02:02:09,375
Balli.

2135
02:02:09,875 --> 02:02:10,458
Balli.

2136
02:02:10,958 --> 02:02:12,125
Balli.

2137
02:02:12,625 --> 02:02:15,291
Your true love made you
the live-in son-in-law.

2138
02:02:15,791 --> 02:02:19,291
Ask Vikrant sir to adopt me as well.

2139
02:02:23,916 --> 02:02:27,125
"Where are you looking?
Your hero's right here."

2140
02:02:27,625 --> 02:02:32,916
"Where are you looking?
Your hero's right here."

2141
02:02:33,416 --> 02:02:34,250
Wow, Shinu.

2142
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:36,875
You fooled Vikrant for 10 days.

2143
02:02:37,375 --> 02:02:40,208
He didn't know that you came
to Bangkok to take me back.

2144
02:02:40,708 --> 02:02:43,000
I look sweet, innocent type.

2145
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:45,458
But actually I am big rascal.

2146
02:02:45,958 --> 02:02:46,791
Oh, really.

2147
02:02:47,291 --> 02:02:47,666
I love you. - I love you.

2148
02:02:48,166 --> 02:02:50,166
I love you, so much.

2149
02:02:50,666 --> 02:02:52,875
I never came across a
bigger rascal than you.

2150
02:02:53,375 --> 02:02:53,936
Say thank you.

2151
02:02:54,333 --> 02:02:55,208
Thank you, Shinu.

2152
02:02:55,708 --> 02:02:56,458
Look after her.

2153
02:02:56,958 --> 02:02:59,875
Really.

2154
02:03:00,375 --> 02:03:01,708
They look so happy.

2155
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:03,289
Made for each other. - Yes.

2156
02:03:03,708 --> 02:03:05,375
They will give you grandchildren..

2157
02:03:05,875 --> 02:03:08,583
..and make the Singhal family proud, sir.

2158
02:03:09,083 --> 02:03:11,125
But who will plough my field now, sir?

2159
02:03:11,625 --> 02:03:16,500
Shinu, it's not wrong to tell a
thousand lies to save one marriage.

2160
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,708
Now see how I make your fields
flourish again with one lie.

2161
02:03:21,208 --> 02:03:25,208
Flourish! Flourish! Flourish!

2162
02:03:25,708 --> 02:03:28,666
Sunaina, Shinu is a nice boy.

2163
02:03:29,166 --> 02:03:31,250
Please, I don't want that boy.

2164
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:34,333
He's already left me once for
the sake of your property.

2165
02:03:34,833 --> 02:03:35,583
Tomorrow if he finds someone richer..

2166
02:03:36,083 --> 02:03:37,004
..he'll leave me again.

2167
02:03:37,208 --> 02:03:39,041
Sunaina, you're wrong.

2168
02:03:39,541 --> 02:03:41,250
Shinu is a gem.

2169
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:44,041
He took 10 days not to
know my daughter better..

2170
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:49,541
..but to bring Angad and Ayesha closer.

2171
02:03:50,041 --> 02:03:51,041
Right, son-in-law

2172
02:03:51,541 --> 02:03:53,291
Yes..something like that.

2173
02:03:53,791 --> 02:03:54,791
Exactly sir. - Yes.

2174
02:03:55,291 --> 02:03:55,916
Good.

2175
02:03:56,416 --> 02:03:56,977
Really? - Yes.

2176
02:03:57,333 --> 02:03:59,125
Fine, then I am ready to marry Shinu.

2177
02:03:59,625 --> 02:04:03,708
Great. Great. Great. - Shinu!

2178
02:04:04,208 --> 02:04:05,583
What a lucky man I am.

2179
02:04:06,083 --> 02:04:07,644
Today I don't just have two daughters..

2180
02:04:07,666 --> 02:04:08,791
..but also two sons-in-law.

2181
02:04:09,291 --> 02:04:10,212
What do you say, Balli?

2182
02:04:10,541 --> 02:04:13,083
'Just like evidence is
called proof in English.'

2183
02:04:13,583 --> 02:04:15,458
'The ceiling of the house
is called a roof.'

2184
02:04:15,958 --> 02:04:20,291
'Similarly, in every language
you're called fools.'
