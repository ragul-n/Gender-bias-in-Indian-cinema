1
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,042
<i>And after taking a single,</i>
<i>Shiva More is on strike again.</i>

2
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:04,167
<i>10 runs are required in 3 balls.</i>

3
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,625
<i>It's an interesting match.</i>

4
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,667
<i>Here's the next ball for Shiva More.</i>

5
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,625
<i>And that shot goes all</i>
<i>the way to the boundary.</i>

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,083
<i>Things are looking</i>
<i>bright for Shiva's team.</i>

7
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,375
<i>But they still require</i>
<i>6 runs in 2 balls.</i>

8
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,833
Go for it, Shiva.

9
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,208
<i>These are the last two balls.</i>

10
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:30,250
<i>And the bowler wants</i>
<i>some changes in the fielding.</i>

11
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,208
<i>Corporator Signor Pratap Rao Sawant...</i>

12
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:35,875
<i>has graced us with his presence</i>
<i>to boost the morale of his team.</i>

13
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:40,042
<i>And that's a magnificent shot,</i>
<i>overturning the bowler's strategy.</i>

14
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:43,750
<i>And there is celebration</i>
<i>amongst the crowd.</i>

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,625
<i>Shiva More's team is</i>
<i>on the verge of winning.</i>

16
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,625
<i>Jadhav, this boy</i>
<i>is playing quite well.</i>

17
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:53,833
Keep an eye on them.

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,667
<i>Sawant sir's team looks worried.</i>

19
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:58,125
<i>They might lose the cup this time.</i>

20
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,000
<i>And now Shiva More is getting</i>
<i>ready to face the last ball.</i>

21
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,500
<i>The umpire signals the bowler to stop.</i>

22
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,542
<i>The bowler returns to his spot.</i>

23
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,708
<i>Everyone's holding on to their breath.</i>

24
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,292
It's the last ball. Stay focused.

25
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:13,875
<i>Here comes the last ball.</i>

26
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,375
And that's a wide ball.

27
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,875
<i>But the umpire didn't</i>
<i>signal for a wide ball.</i>

28
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:23,708
<i>So Sawant sir's team</i>
<i>wins the match today.</i>

29
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,500
<i>The batsman doesn't look too pleased</i>
<i>with the umpire's decision.</i>

30
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,792
<i>He's heading toward the umpire.</i>

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,542
<i>He looks angry.</i>

32
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,542
SWARAJYA ASSOCIATION PRESENTS
THE SWARAJYA TROPHY.

33
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,542
Beat him.

34
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,333
Beat him, Shiva.

35
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,125
Jadhav. I want that boy.

36
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,792
Invest in him.

37
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,708
So, should I let them win?

38
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:14,542
What are you looking at?

39
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,417
Hit it, guys.

40
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,250
Do you plan on moving in today?

41
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,667
-Yes, Uncle.
-Then go get your stuff by evening.

42
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,083
Hit it.

43
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,792
Stop. Stop.

44
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,000
Come. Let's go.

45
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,542
Come on, boys.

46
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,250
Did you win the war?

47
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,458
I will win it.

48
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,708
Sawant sir is pretty impressed by me.

49
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,000
Because I defeated his team.

50
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,208
Mom... we're running out of space.

51
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,792
Really... then buy a bigger home.

52
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,000
I will buy it someday.

53
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,083
I know you will.
Curse that bloody game.

54
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,667
I wish you had focused on studies...

55
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,167
then your father wouldn't be so angry.

56
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:33,583
Mom... I didn't win to make him happy.

57
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,167
But he's struggling to keep us happy.

58
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:37,958
Each one has his own fate.

59
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
We can't help it.

60
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:48,833
Mom, I need more eggs.

61
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,000
-Mom...
-Yes.

62
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,250
Mom...

63
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,125
Sachin's a champ!

64
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,917
Rascal!

65
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,042
When are you going to stop it?

66
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:04,500
Tell me!

67
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,042
You have no respect for anyone.

68
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,458
You go around picking
a fight with everyone.

69
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,500
You thrashed the umpire today.

70
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,125
The entire neighborhood is ashamed of you.

71
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:17,583
I stay awake at night
worrying about your future.

72
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,750
And you...

73
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,375
Why aren't you worried?

74
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,125
How dare you?

75
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,208
Why are you staring at me?

76
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,375
Please, let it be.

77
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,958
Everyone's watching us.

78
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,833
He will mend his ways someday.

79
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:32,958
When will that day arrive?

80
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,708
After we're dead?

81
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:36,792
And you...

82
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:39,875
Keep feeding him eggs.

83
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,000
Here. Eat it.

84
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,583
Eat it. You will have to eat it.

85
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,375
How dare you stare at me?

86
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,000
I will not spare you today.

87
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,458
-Even if I die, I won't...
-Quiet!

88
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,958
Hit me.
Come on. Hit me.

89
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:58,625
It has come to this.

90
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,333
Go on.

91
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,542
Don't you dare come back again!

92
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,833
What did you do
to give birth to a son like him?

93
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,708
We would've been better off without him.

94
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,125
He didn't think while having fun...

95
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,500
and now he claims that
they were better off without me.

96
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,708
There's hardly any
space for people to walk...

97
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,958
and you want to ride your cycle up here.

98
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:26,708
Keep it downstairs.

99
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,417
She's so stupid.

100
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,542
What?

101
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:37,042
Did you say something?

102
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,667
This is a respectable neighborhood.

103
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,208
So, if you want to continue living here,
then learn to be polite.

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,083
Right?

105
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:46,833
Right.

106
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,417
He's a complete dimwit.

107
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,500
Everyone's fed with him.

108
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,625
You will get used to all this.

109
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,000
Well... my name is Swati.

110
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,833
Here. Hold it quickly.

111
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,500
You are not quick enough.

112
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:16,750
Sis, this place is so small.

113
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And you forgot to bring all my toys.

114
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,208
Stay calm, Deepu.

115
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:21,875
Deepu's absolutely right.

116
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,167
Even our bathroom was bigger than this.

117
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:28,083
Wasn't it?

118
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,792
-Papa...
-Yes.

119
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,583
We're all very happy here.

120
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:40,833
Aren't we, Mom?

121
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:42,792
Of course, we are.

122
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,833
And anyway...
this is how we began in the first place.

123
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,625
We'll manage.

124
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,875
I know we will. But...

125
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:00,792
What about these two?

126
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,125
They will manage as well.

127
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:04,958
it's time to take your pills.

128
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,708
JANSEVA BOOTH NUMBER 489.

129
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,958
Call Choubey
for a meeting tomorrow.

130
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:34,125
-Okay.
-We need him to vacate a house.

131
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,083
Okay.

132
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,000
Sir.

133
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes.

134
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,375
Hail Maharashtra, sir.

135
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,333
Hail Maharashtra.

136
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,125
Shiva, we must help our brethren.

137
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,458
You can count on me, sir.

138
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:52,958
What do we have to do?

139
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,042
Every day,
millions of people come to Mumbai...

140
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,167
especially from the North.

141
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,083
And we must stop them.

142
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,958
I already had a word
with Jadhav about this.

143
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,167
He will explain it to you.

144
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,250
Yes, sir.

145
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,458
They are our boys.

146
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,042
Take good care of them.

147
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,083
Of course, sir.

148
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:39,083
<i>Oh my...</i>

149
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,833
<i>My... my...</i>
<i>Oh my...</i>

150
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,708
<i>You're smitten by my youth</i>

151
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,542
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

152
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,458
<i>Your eyes convey a message...</i>

153
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,292
<i>Oh my...</i>

154
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:04,750
<i>Everywhere you look...</i>
<i>It's me that you see...</i>

155
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,667
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

156
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,542
<i>You're smitten by my youth</i>

157
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,375
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

158
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,208
<i>Your eyes clearly convey</i>

159
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:14,042
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

160
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:19,500
<i>Everywhere you look...</i>
<i>It's me that you see...</i>

161
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,208
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

162
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:49,125
<i>Listen, girl</i>
<i>You are being stubborn and immature</i>

163
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,792
<i>Listen, girl</i>
<i>You are being stubborn and immature</i>

164
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,500
<i>I am here to win your love and respect</i>

165
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,208
<i>I am here to win your love and respect</i>

166
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:05,708
<i>Everywhere you look...</i>
<i>It's me that you see...</i>

167
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,542
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

168
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,458
<i>You're smitten by my youth</i>

169
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:11,333
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

170
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,125
<i>Your eyes convey a message</i>

171
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,250
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

172
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,500
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

173
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,167
<i>Don't go away...</i>
<i>Let's have some fun</i>

174
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,792
<i>I am the king of hearts...</i>
<i>You are my queen...</i>

175
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,583
<i>I'll let you dwell in my heart...</i>
<i>And I'll close all the doors</i>

176
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:32,875
<i>No...</i>

177
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,583
<i>No...</i>

178
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,208
<i>Don't tease me</i>

179
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,917
<i>No...</i>

180
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:43,042
<i>If you don't listen to me,</i>
<i>You will regret it later</i>

181
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,375
<i>If you don't listen to me,</i>
<i>You will regret it later</i>

182
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:50,042
<i>I am the flood and a tsunami</i>

183
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,458
<i>I am water, flood and a tsunami</i>

184
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:59,208
<i>Everywhere you look...</i>
<i>It's me that you see...</i>

185
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:01,083
<i>Oh my...</i>

186
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,000
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

187
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,792
<i>You're crazy about me</i>

188
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,625
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

189
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,458
<i>Your eyes convey a message</i>

190
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,250
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

191
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:15,875
<i>Everywhere you look...</i>
<i>It's me that you see...</i>

192
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,708
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

193
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,375
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

194
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,125
<i>Oh my...</i>
<i>My... my...</i>

195
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,042
Sawant sir is the best.

196
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,500
How much did you drink today?

197
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,750
<i>Oh my...</i>

198
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,375
<i>My...My...</i>

199
00:14:58,958 --> 00:14:59,958
Wait.

200
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,417
Come on. Wake up.

201
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,833
Hey, Jagya.
Are you awake?

202
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,458
Come on.

203
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,625
Skip it, Babban.

204
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,625
Hello.
I am Vijaya More.

205
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,958
I live in that room.

206
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:42,417
I made some cereal in the morning,
and I thought that...

207
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,875
You shouldn't have gone
through all that trouble.

208
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,708
She's Astha. My daughter.

209
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,542
-She loves to eat cereals.
-Really?

210
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:52,333
Then take it.
It's made for you.

211
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,792
Whenever you want to eat some
fresh cereals, then come right over.

212
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,292
What's her name?

213
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,542
Mom's name.

214
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:04,917
He's sleeping on the terrace.

215
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,958
Our kids don't bother
to wake up early.

216
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,125
He must be working late last night.
I'll go take a look.

217
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,208
Did you guys relocate?

218
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,125
Auntie, if you need anything at all...

219
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,792
come to room no. 7.

220
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,750
Astha, go inside.

221
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,042
-Aunty, if you need anything at all...
-Of course.

222
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,917
If we need anything,
we'll come and meet you.

223
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,083
Okay.

224
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,958
She's feisty.

225
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,750
<i>It feels so heavenly tonight...</i>

226
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,458
Babban, what's the occasion today?

227
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,750
My chances of getting
married are looking bright.

228
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,917
-I am in love.
-Again?

229
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,833
Mind it,
Nandya, this time it's for real.

230
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,542
Like Jack and Rose.

231
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,125
So, you're going to die in the end, right?

232
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,250
Fine.

233
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,083
Who is that unfortunate girl?

234
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,667
<i>It feels so heavenly tonight...</i>

235
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,708
Nandu, she studies in a reputed college.

236
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,208
Her father made a huge fortune
by investing in the share market.

237
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:28,542
People like you mop
the floors of their home.

238
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,250
Fine. The truth is always bitter.

239
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,375
Well... but they soon
ran out of their fortune...

240
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,167
and had to move from their
bungalow to Bhonsle's home.

241
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,542
She was filthy rich.

242
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:39,500
Here she comes.

243
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,958
What do you think about my choice, guys?

244
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,625
What is her name? Tripathi?

245
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,083
-Will the bus come from this direction?
-Yes.

246
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,625
Bus No. 55.

247
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,625
Why hasn't it arrived yet?

248
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,875
We'll have to get rid of
this filth before Sawant finds out.

249
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,792
Our reputation is at stake.

250
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,667
Finally, we have a beautiful
face in this dump to look at...

251
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,667
and you're worried about Sawant.

252
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,708
Don't worry. Come to me,
if you ever need anything.

253
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:39,042
Hey, Bhonsle. Have you lost your mind?

254
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,125
How could a Maharashtrian like
you let a Tripathi rent your home?

255
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,250
Have you lost your mind?

256
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,958
Shiva, I am like your father.

257
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,708
Don't try to be my father.

258
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,542
-Just answer my question.
-What?

259
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,625
It's my home.

260
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,167
They seemed like good people...
so, I let them stay.

261
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,375
Great.

262
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,292
You're breeding traitors
and having fun as well.

263
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,542
If they are good people,
then let them stay in your home.

264
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,708
Hey, Bhonsle.
If anything goes wrong...

265
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,250
then you will be held responsible for it.

266
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,292
Look...

267
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:11,458
It's good...

268
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,333
that you guys are settled.

269
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,375
Yes...

270
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,042
We are settled...

271
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,042
but I am worried.

272
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,750
There's a madman who
stays right next door.

273
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:24,042
Don't worry.

274
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,417
Aditya's back.
He will handle everything.

275
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,500
Did you speak with Astha?

276
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,208
Well... Nirmala.
Aditya spent all these years abroad...

277
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,000
and our situation
isn't what it used to be.

278
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,125
That's not an issue.

279
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,750
We will never find a girl like Astha.

280
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,958
They grew up together and played together.

281
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,417
And now they can start
a new life together.

282
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,250
Stop thinking too hard.

283
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,750
You can talk to Astha,
while we talk to Aditya.

284
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:04,042
<i>Please clap for Ravi Tambe.</i>
<i>The body builder from Samarth Gymnasium.</i>

285
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,750
<i>He is flaunting his body.</i>
<i>Please encourage him.</i>

286
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,333
<i>That's very nice.</i>

287
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,458
<i>Wonderful.</i>
<i>What a body!</i>

288
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,792
<i>Very good.</i>

289
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,375
<i>Nice.</i>

290
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,667
<i>I am pleased to announce that...</i>

291
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:19,875
<i>on the occasion of</i>
<i>our corporator's birthday...</i>

292
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,167
<i>everyone is here in large numbers.</i>

293
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,792
There's some trouble outside.

294
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,375
<i>And here's Ravi Tambe...</i>

295
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,792
<i>the body builder from Samarth Gymnasium.</i>

296
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,500
<i>Let's have a huge round</i>
<i>of applause for them.</i>

297
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,208
Don't worry.
I was...

298
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,375
Look at the damage!

299
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,708
Everything is ruined.

300
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,333
-What happened?
-Nothing, Shiva.

301
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:46,333
I was just coming in
and I bumped into his car.

302
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,500
You broke my Merc's headlight.
Bro, this is major damage.

303
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,458
You'll have to pay for it.

304
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,458
Shiva, this guy wants me to pay.

305
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:57,792
Of course.
You damaged my car.

306
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,792
Go on, Ranga, I will deal with him.

307
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:00,875
Who are you?

308
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,917
Bro, you'll have to pay up.
You damaged my car.

309
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,708
He's here now,
he will pay for the damage.

310
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,583
Why will he pay? You damaged my car.

311
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,542
-We will pay for it.
-Go ahead then.

312
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:13,958
Look...

313
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,750
The king is in the house.

314
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,583
It's his birthday today.
Go ask him to pay for your damage.

315
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,583
Now you listen to me.

316
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:25,000
Get out of here.

317
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,333
Or the damage might
get more extensive...

318
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,917
for the car as well as...

319
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,250
Understood.

320
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,417
Now get lost.

321
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,125
Get rid of this idiot.

322
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,333
Get lost.

323
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,833
Who is he?

324
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:41,458
I don't know.
What a fool!

325
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:46,083
Come on.

326
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,333
Dad was offering
you a much better place...

327
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,083
so why didn't you guys take it?

328
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,625
But this place isn't worth living.

329
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:58,667
Are you done?

330
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,625
Shall we go home?

331
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,083
Get going.

332
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,625
-What's this?
-Let it be.

333
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,042
Bet she's his girlfriend.

334
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,292
Nonsense.

335
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,625
Who cares?
But beer's on him.

336
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,792
-When did you get this?
-Right now.

337
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,458
Come here.

338
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:28,833
Yes, Mom.

339
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,292
Who is it?

340
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:45,667
Hey, Astha. Come inside.

341
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,167
I just came by to return your plate.

342
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:50,417
So what? You are always
welcome in our home.

343
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,083
-No, Auntie.
-Come inside.

344
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,333
Sonu, get up.
Let her sit. And take this inside.

345
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:56,958
Come on.

346
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,833
Go get something to drink.

347
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,083
I am not going anywhere.

348
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,375
It's all right, Auntie.
I just had coffee.

349
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,417
I've got something for you.

350
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,583
What?

351
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,375
It's my father's favorite food.
So, my mom makes them often.

352
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,833
A bottle of mustard oil can be used
for cooking and cleansing.

353
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,125
Shut up, stupid.

354
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,125
Astha, ignore him.

355
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,375
Oh my...

356
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:23,208
This is more than enough.

357
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,875
Sonu. Get some snacks.

358
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,542
Go on.

359
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:34,375
Here you go.

360
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,125
Try some, dear.

361
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,708
My snacks are so popular
in this neighborhood.

362
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:44,250
I get huge orders all year round.

363
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,125
Do you like them?

364
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:51,792
Listen... remember I told
you about our new neighbors.

365
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:53,417
She is Astha.

366
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,458
What do you do?

367
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:01,167
I am studying for the CA exam.

368
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,708
Wow.

369
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,625
Now that's talent.

370
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,542
Why don't you tutor our daughter as well?

371
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,708
His brother's a big loser.

372
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:18,542
See you, Auntie.

373
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,417
Yes, Auntie.

374
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,708
Will you tutor our daughter?

375
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,917
Is it okay if I give it some thought?

376
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,458
Of course. Take all the time you need.

377
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You'll get more children
to tutor in this neighborhood.

378
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,125
Okay, Auntie.

379
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:37,542
-Yes.
-Can you keep this in the refrigerator?

380
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,500
Why don't you get it embossed on
the nameplate that your son is a loser?

381
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,833
If you're not ashamed of it, then
why should I be ashamed of admitting it.

382
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,792
He will always remain a loser.

383
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,042
Loser.

384
00:24:58,875 --> 00:24:59,917
-Guys.
-Yes.

385
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,375
We should start collecting
donations from next week.

386
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,750
Of course, we will.

387
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:05,792
Hey, fool. Stop boasting.

388
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,167
You're always missing in action.

389
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,083
If there's more crowd,
there's more money.

390
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,167
Right, Shiva.

391
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,333
Auntie, 501 isn't enough.

392
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,917
You must give me at least 1,001 rupees.

393
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,833
Right.

394
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,333
Everyone did. Take a look.

395
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:26,792
1001?

396
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:27,708
-Yes.
-Yes.

397
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,083
But isn't charity supposed
to be done voluntarily.

398
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,542
Exactly, auntie.
You are supposed to give it voluntarily.

399
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:33,458
-Yeah...
-Yeah...

400
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:34,458
Otherwise, it will be a sin.

401
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:35,750
Yes, sin.

402
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,125
See...

403
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:41,000
This is all I have right now.

404
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:43,000
I'll talk to your uncle
when he returns in the evening.

405
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,500
-Keep this for now.
-No, auntie.

406
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,792
Nandya, what's the commotion about?

407
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,792
We're not dependent on
them for hosting this event.

408
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,083
Take whatever she's giving you.

409
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,167
There are other people
who are willing to pay.

410
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:58,917
-Astha's here.
-Wait...

411
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,375
-But, I...
-Mom.

412
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,917
We have heard enough.

413
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:09,000
See... she is so generous.

414
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:11,917
Take this one too.

415
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,375
Okay.

416
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,292
This is all I have right now.

417
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,542
What about the rest?

418
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,250
There are other people
who are willing to pay.

419
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,042
Go take it from them.

420
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,042
Thank you.

421
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:32,750
This time the collection was really good.

422
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:33,958
Yes. We made a lot this time.

423
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:35,333
Babban, you still have to pay 50 rupees.

424
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:36,333
What? 50 rupees?

425
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:37,292
You borrowed it
for buying cigarettes.

426
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:38,542
-Here, count this.
-I'll pay later.

427
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,708
-First, multiply 3 with 6.
-Okay.

428
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:42,167
Now, what is the answer?

429
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,833
Oh my,
this is a night school?

430
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:48,458
This is the only hangout we had,
but now it's gone.

431
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,833
Here you go.
Now go home and drink these.

432
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,167
Wait.

433
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,833
No one's going anywhere.

434
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,458
Multiply it with 16 and
tell me the answer...

435
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,833
Sonu! Go get some water.

436
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,208
Wait, Sonu.

437
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,250
Why don't you also
get some glasses for us?

438
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,917
We'll share a drink with them as well.

439
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,792
And also get some ice
from my refrigerator.

440
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,750
I am sure you guys got the snacks.

441
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:17,792
Right?

442
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,292
Should I ask her to
get some snacks as well?

443
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,542
Go ahead.

444
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,833
Do you think I'm here
to listen to your nonsense?

445
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:26,958
-And you guys, get going.
-No one's going anywhere.

446
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,625
If anyone has a problem, then
they can talk to Uncle Bhonsle.

447
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,917
Does Bhonsle think he owns the
place because he owns a few homes here?

448
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,667
I guess that Bhonsle
needs to be taught a lesson.

449
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:39,250
Sonu, I think we should
call the police too.

450
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,042
These guys are wasting
the donation on booze.

451
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,792
Imagine the country's fate.

452
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,292
Enough with the lecture.

453
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:48,042
Or else, I'll teach you a lesson.

454
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,500
And keep this charade
restricted to your home.

455
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,333
-But she is just...
-Babban.

456
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:53,458
Don't interfere.

457
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,750
You don't know them.

458
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:58,000
One comes first
and then--

459
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,292
What are you talking about?
We are all Indians here.

460
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:03,083
If you're an Indian,
then go live in India.

461
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,375
Why did you come to Mumbai?

462
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,417
Look, I was born right here in Mumbai.

463
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:09,917
And I am equally proud
of being a Maharashtrian.

464
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,167
Did you hear that?

465
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,000
-Yeah, right.
-"Maharashtrian!"

466
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:17,417
You're speaking out of context.
Don't drive me mad.

467
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,333
What do these people
know about our culture?

468
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,833
What do you know about your culture?

469
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,375
And you're already out of your mind,
so, let me fix it.

470
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,917
Is speaking rudely with
others a part of your culture?

471
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,542
Is squandering the donation
on booze a part of your culture?

472
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,500
She knows Marathi.

473
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:39,958
I wonder what's the ego about.
You don't even have a job!

474
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,208
-Come on.
-Yes, come on.

475
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,875
What are you staring at?

476
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,917
If you're such a proud Maharashtrian...

477
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,458
then do something about it.

478
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,875
Maybe your family
will start respecting you.

479
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:53,792
And won't call you a loser.

480
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:05,667
Sonu, if we multiply 214
with 16, then what's the answer?

481
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:07,667
3,424.

482
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:16,208
And if you multiply 525
with 45, then what's the answer?

483
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:18,458
23,625.

484
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,375
<i>This is so unfair</i>

485
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:12,417
<i>You are speaking through your eyes...</i>
<i>And creating a stir in my heart</i>

486
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,625
<i>You are stealing a glance,</i>
<i>And peering in my eyes</i>

487
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,833
<i>You are creating a stir in my heart</i>

488
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,083
<i>This is so unfair</i>

489
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:32,792
<i>You are speaking through your eyes...</i>
<i>And creating a stir in my heart</i>

490
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,750
<i>You are stealing a glance</i>
<i>And peering in my eyes</i>

491
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,042
<i>You are creating a stir in my heart</i>

492
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:40,958
<i>Tell me what your heart desires</i>

493
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:43,500
<i>The color of love...</i>

494
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,958
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

495
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,708
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

496
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:51,250
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

497
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,750
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

498
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:58,958
<i>Why are you so proud</i>
<i>Of your crazy heart?</i>

499
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:04,125
<i>Why are you so proud</i>
<i>Of your crazy heart?</i>

500
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,500
<i>What are you thinking?</i>
<i>Why are you sulking?</i>

501
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:09,250
<i>Even though you won't say it,</i>
<i>I can read it in your eyes</i>

502
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:14,417
<i>We speak our hearts out to each other</i>

503
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:17,542
<i>We always help each other</i>

504
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,417
<i>The color of love</i>

505
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,833
<i>Oh no</i>

506
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:27,292
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

507
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:29,917
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

508
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,417
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

509
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:34,917
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

510
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,167
<i>Why are you...</i>

511
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:43,542
<i>Talking to me through your eyes</i>

512
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,000
<i>Come on</i>

513
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,458
<i>Let's clap</i>

514
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:02,167
<i>Come on</i>

515
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,458
<i>Let's clap</i>

516
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:06,083
<i>Accept the offerings of happiness</i>

517
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:08,625
<i>Bless us with long lives</i>

518
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:13,833
<i>Come together to celebrate happiness</i>
<i>Come</i>

519
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:18,958
<i>Both of you will prosper</i>
<i>Two hearts, one soul</i>

520
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,500
<i>This is life's sermon</i>

521
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,000
<i>Love is a blessing</i>

522
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,833
<i>Tell me what your heart desires</i>

523
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:29,292
<i>The color of love...</i>
<i>Oh, no</i>

524
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,917
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

525
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,500
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

526
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,958
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

527
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,625
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

528
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:40,875
<i>This is so unfair...</i>

529
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:44,625
<i>You are speaking through your eyes...</i>
<i>And creating a stir in my heart</i>

530
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:47,292
<i>You are stealing a glance,</i>
<i>And peering in my eyes</i>

531
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,750
<i>You are creating a stir in my heart</i>

532
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:52,542
<i>Tell me what your heart desires</i>

533
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:55,000
<i>The color of love...</i>

534
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:57,667
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

535
00:32:57,792 --> 00:33:00,250
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

536
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,750
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

537
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,208
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

538
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,958
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

539
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,583
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

540
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:13,167
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

541
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:17,042
<i>I am overwhelmed with love</i>

542
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,583
This is way too tight, man.

543
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,542
Uncle, how much is that for?

544
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:28,833
Guys, wish me luck.

545
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:32,083
As soon as they are done...
I will propose to her.

546
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:38,208
-Are you done?
-Yes.

547
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:39,167
Guys...

548
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,083
Wait.

549
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:44,625
She is mine.

550
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,083
Is that a joke?

551
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,583
I like her.

552
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:52,417
-Hand these over to me.
-Shiva, this is unfair.

553
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:53,667
I think I made it pretty clear
in the beginning.

554
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,333
Who cares?

555
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,208
-She looks at me in a different way.
-So...

556
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,708
She does that to every other
mutt on the street.

557
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,875
-What are you doing?
-Shiva. Let him go.

558
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,042
Let's go.

559
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,292
You're crazy.

560
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:16,375
Really?

561
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,375
When did this happen?

562
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,417
The other day, on the terrace.

563
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:30,792
-But isn't she a...
-What?

564
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,583
We are all Indians.

565
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:37,458
Right. Sure, we are.

566
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,542
After 22 years,
I can finally feel my heartbeat.

567
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,458
It's a weird feeling.

568
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,500
But it feels like
I'm on top of the world.

569
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,583
I can't sleep.
I can't eat.

570
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:54,917
Did you see that?

571
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,083
She is looking at me again.

572
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,042
Yes.

573
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,292
Come on.
I should tell her about my feelings.

574
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,292
Aren't you being a little hasty?

575
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:11,542
Get lost, Swati.

576
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:12,833
Go talk to Nandya.

577
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:14,667
Why Nandya?

578
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:17,792
I want to have a private
conversation with her.

579
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,208
The other day... on the terrace...

580
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,958
I...

581
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,708
We are all Indians!

582
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,250
-Glory to...
-Lord Ganesha!

583
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,708
-Come soon...
-Next year!

584
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:59,167
-Glory to...
-Lord Ganesha!

585
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,667
-Glory to...
-Lord Ganesha!

586
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:06,667
-Our Lord will return.
-Yes, he will return.

587
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,083
Our Lord will return.

588
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,375
-Glory to...
-Lord Ganesha!

589
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:13,500
-Come soon...
-Next year!

590
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:27,250
-Glory to...
-Lord Ganesha!

591
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:30,000
-Come soon...
-Next year!

592
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,500
Stop. Stop.

593
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:33,500
Come on, everyone. Get down.

594
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,958
Astha, let's go.

595
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,333
Shiva, are you going to sleep all day?

596
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,333
Yeah.

597
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:41,625
Well... Shinde's Chinese Center
has lost all its glory.

598
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:43,250
Look...

599
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,500
Looks like someone spat in my soup.

600
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,083
This is what you deserve.

601
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:50,000
We did everything for them.

602
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:53,125
We kept awake at nights...

603
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,625
but now when it's time to pay...

604
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,917
that idiot Babban ratted out on us.

605
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,083
They know all about Astha.

606
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:06,000
Sawant refused to pay 2,200 rupees?

607
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,458
Will I have to steal it now?

608
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:10,958
Steal?

609
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,625
Even if you murder someone, she
will not be impressed by you.

610
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,583
That guy owns a Mercedes.

611
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,458
Can you even buy her a cup of soup?

612
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:19,833
Do you think I'm a loser?

613
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,042
Do you think I can't even
buy a locket for her?

614
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:25,208
Have I ever felt like
this for any girl before?

615
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,750
Was I ever mesmerized by anyone's scent?

616
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:29,667
To hell with their scent.

617
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,958
But, what about our body odor?

618
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,167
You love her, don't you?

619
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,417
Then listen to me carefully.

620
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:38,417
Give her anything you want...

621
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,625
but it has to be something
that you can afford.

622
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,292
Something worth a couple of bucks.

623
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,292
-A couple of bucks.
-Yes.

624
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,625
But make sure it's from your heart.

625
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:15,583
<i>My heart's finally struck a chord</i>

626
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:21,125
<i>Love has finally found a way</i>

627
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:25,125
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>I am floating in the air...</i>

628
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:28,667
<i>Like a colorful bubble</i>

629
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,042
<i>Overwhelmed...</i>

630
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:34,583
<i>Overwhelmed...</i>

631
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:41,417
<i>I've been overwhelmed by love</i>

632
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:44,667
<i>Overwhelmed...</i>

633
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,542
<i>Overwhelmed...</i>

634
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:55,208
<i>I've been overwhelmed by love</i>

635
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,833
<i>Come to me...</i>
<i>I'll never leave your side</i>

636
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:29,125
<i>I'll never leave your side</i>

637
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:34,625
<i>Breaking free of every bond</i>

638
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:40,125
<i>I am waiting down your lane</i>

639
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:43,833
<i>My heart conveys...</i>

640
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:49,792
<i>Your thoughts never leave my head</i>

641
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,542
<i>Overwhelmed...</i>

642
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,083
<i>Overwhelmed...</i>

643
00:40:57,417 --> 00:41:02,750
<i>I've been overwhelmed by love</i>

644
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,292
<i>The tradition of love...</i>

645
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:08,042
<i>And my devotion...</i>

646
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,625
<i>It's you</i>
<i>Only you</i>

647
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,333
<i>My life dwells in you</i>

648
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:15,833
<i>The tradition of love...</i>

649
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:18,583
<i>And my devotion...</i>

650
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,875
<i>It's you</i>
<i>Only you</i>

651
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:25,583
<i>My life dwells in you</i>

652
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,750
I want to tell you something.

653
00:41:58,208 --> 00:41:59,167
I mean...

654
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:03,875
I am addicted to you.

655
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:07,167
-Well, you shouldn't be.
-Why?

656
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,250
I love you.

657
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,417
Look what I got for you.

658
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,542
Sorry, I was only trying
to give you this chain...

659
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,208
What chain?
And why?

660
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:30,500
Aren't you ashamed of
troubling a female on the bus?

661
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,333
How dare you trouble a female?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

662
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:34,708
She knows me.

663
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:37,250
You can ask her.

664
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:41,708
First, you trouble
her and now you lie to us.

665
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:43,042
Trying to be a smart, are you?

666
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:44,500
-Beat him.
-Beat him.

667
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,208
Come on, get down.

668
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:34,375
Hey, Astha. Thank God you're back.

669
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:37,292
I've kept some curd in your refrigerator.

670
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,042
What happened?

671
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,333
You look sad.

672
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:58,875
Just a minute, Auntie.

673
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,833
Keep this chain.

674
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:04,583
It belongs to Shiva.

675
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:56,708
How are you, Shiva?

676
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,000
How did you get that wound?

677
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:10,000
Wounds inflicted on your
body are easily visible...

678
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,208
but not the ones on your heart.

679
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:18,042
You do have a heart.

680
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:23,708
The entire neighborhood
claims that you don't.

681
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:28,917
How I see it is that...
your heart's finally started to beat.

682
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:34,833
It doesn't happen to everyone.

683
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,333
Don't repeat the
mistake your father did?

684
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,292
I lived through an entire lifetime...

685
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:51,792
without love and adoration.

686
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,292
Your father never bestowed me with love.

687
00:45:57,875 --> 00:46:02,417
For him, I was apt for
making tea and cereals in the morning...

688
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:05,458
and at night...

689
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:16,250
I was subjected to a lifetime of abuse.

690
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,250
You should have at least
bought something better.

691
00:46:37,292 --> 00:46:38,167
Want some rice?

692
00:46:56,542 --> 00:47:01,708
<i>Bless us with enough strength...</i>

693
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:06,958
<i>So, we never lose faith</i>

694
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:11,250
<i>May we always tread down</i>
<i>The path of honesty...</i>

695
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,917
What happened, Shiva?

696
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:17,958
<i>And never waver</i>

697
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,750
Everyone's dressed
so well for the occasion.

698
00:47:21,417 --> 00:47:22,792
Why do you look upset?

699
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:25,500
You should have worn something better.

700
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,792
<i>Bless us with enough strength...</i>

701
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:37,250
She is looking at you.

702
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:41,750
It's too noisy out here.

703
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:48,917
<i>Always tread down the path of honesty...</i>

704
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,917
Wait.

705
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:51,792
Let her go now.

706
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:53,292
Don't make a scene.

707
00:47:55,667 --> 00:48:00,417
<i>Bless us with enough strength...</i>

708
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:04,792
<i>So that we never lose faith</i>

709
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:09,958
Shiva, don't do that.

710
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:20,458
<i>Listen O beloved...</i>
<i>My heart's crazy...</i>

711
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:25,750
<i>Dying to perish in your love</i>

712
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:30,500
<i>I'll come to your home...</i>
<i>And take you away</i>

713
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:35,083
<i>I am your Romeo,</i>
<i>And you're my Juliet</i>

714
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,417
<i>I swear...</i>

715
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,167
<i>I swear...</i>

716
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:48,833
<i>I swear...</i>
<i>I love you, beloved</i>

717
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:55,750
<i>I swear...</i>
<i>I love you, beloved</i>

718
00:48:56,667 --> 00:49:03,625
<i>My heart sways...</i>
<i>Frantically and conveys...</i>

719
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,125
<i>I swear...</i>

720
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:14,000
<i>I swear...</i>
<i>I love you, beloved</i>

721
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,708
<i>I am not some stranger...</i>

722
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:45,833
<i>We are the talk of the town</i>

723
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:52,333
<i>I am not some stranger...</i>

724
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,958
<i>We are the talk of the town</i>

725
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:59,333
<i>Come, marry me...</i>

726
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:02,083
<i>Come, marry me...</i>

727
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:05,875
<i>Or else, I will sweep you away</i>

728
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:07,625
<i>I swear...</i>

729
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:14,625
<i>I swear...</i>
<i>I love you, beloved</i>

730
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:21,917
<i>I swear...</i>
<i>I love you, beloved</i>

731
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:30,708
<i>My heart sways...</i>
<i>Frantically and conveys...</i>

732
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:32,500
<i>I swear...</i>

733
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:36,042
<i>I swear...</i>

734
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:43,167
<i>I swear...</i>
<i>I love you, beloved</i>

735
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:45,917
<i>I swear...</i>

736
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,292
-Did he trouble you the other day?
-It wasn't his fault, Aditya.

737
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,083
Then whose fault was it?

738
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:00,500
Answer me!

739
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,333
So, you didn't get rattled
by what happened that day?

740
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,583
And I got to know about it now.

741
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:12,708
The other day, I tried to
kiss you and you were irritated.

742
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,750
-We're getting married soon.
-But we aren't married yet.

743
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:18,375
But we will.

744
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,625
Aditya, I said "no!"

745
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:43,917
You dropped your chain...
downstairs.

746
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,500
Just a minute.
Move.

747
00:51:58,583 --> 00:51:59,917
Does he just come
whenever he wants?

748
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:03,458
Let me know if he does it again.

749
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,833
Aditya... Aditya, no.

750
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:13,375
I said "no."

751
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:16,583
I said "no!"

752
00:52:22,417 --> 00:52:23,333
What now?

753
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:28,500
Do you need some help?

754
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:47,208
Damn!

755
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,500
Were you playing cricket?

756
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:53,458
-No.
-Aditya, did you have dinner?

757
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:54,417
No, auntie.

758
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:56,042
-Sit down, I'll see.
-Okay?

759
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,500
You wouldn't have seen me out
if mom and dad hadn't insisted, right?

760
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:04,292
Come on.

761
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:10,833
-Sit inside, it's going to get messy.
-Aditya, what's all this?

762
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:12,833
He needs to be taught a lesson.

763
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:17,583
Hey, young man. We heard that
you were troubling her.

764
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,792
I know it wasn't his fault.

765
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:28,292
What are you really angry about, Aditya?

766
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:31,292
Is it the episode
on the bus the other day...

767
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:33,417
or that he saved me from you?

768
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:39,958
Will you ever do it again?

769
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,125
So...

770
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,417
The lad's apologizing.

771
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,417
-Shall I let him go?
-He's worse than he looks.

772
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,500
Teach him a lesson.

773
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,333
Hey, bro...

774
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,042
I may be a goon and not fit for her...

775
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:10,417
but he isn't either.

776
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:12,583
He only dresses sharply...

777
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,917
but his heart's
uglier than your face.

778
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,583
Hey... catch him.

779
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:56,208
Break his bones.

780
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:53,500
I let him go.

781
00:57:54,542 --> 00:57:55,750
But I won't let go of you.

782
00:58:19,167 --> 00:58:21,000
-Come on.
-Do you want to have some fun?

783
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,333
Sawant sir was asking about you, Shiva.

784
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:28,583
He said that he doesn't see you
at the office these days.

785
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:31,500
He's been keeping an eye on you.

786
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:33,542
He knows everything about you.

787
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:38,917
Even about the fight that broke out
at the bus stop a couple of days ago.

788
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,250
Very good.

789
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:43,292
Sir is happy.

790
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:45,500
He sent me to reward you.

791
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:49,708
So... how much do you want?

792
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:51,333
Go on.

793
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:54,333
Jadhav... I needed it back then.

794
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:56,208
-You should have told me.
-Why?

795
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:59,542
Would you have paid me
without asking Sawant sir?

796
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:01,500
And one more thing...

797
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,458
We're no longer going
to dirty our hands for you.

798
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:06,583
Understood.

799
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:09,583
Shiva, don't be stupid.
Listen to me.

800
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:12,625
Hey, what are you looking at?

801
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:14,708
Take me to Ambewadi.

802
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:38,708
Wake up, sir. We've arrived.

803
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:41,333
I've to pick up more passengers.

804
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:43,667
Wake up. We've arrived in Ambewadi.
Wake up.

805
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:46,250
You bloody...

806
00:59:58,625 --> 01:00:00,167
Isn't she beautiful?

807
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:06,833
She's after me, you know.

808
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:09,250
She wants me to marry her.

809
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:10,750
Then why don't you marry her?

810
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,542
-You think I should.
-Yes.

811
01:00:15,042 --> 01:00:18,042
-Will you come to the wedding?
-If you invite me...

812
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:19,917
I will sing a song for you.

813
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:22,125
Damn!
Really?

814
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,958
You're a singer.

815
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,042
Come on.

816
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,583
Sing something to impress her.

817
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:37,792
Really?

818
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:40,542
<i>All by myself...</i>

819
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:42,917
<i>Here...</i>
<i>I am again</i>

820
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:45,750
<i>I am drunk again</i>

821
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,500
<i>Love is like death</i>

822
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:50,042
<i>And death is endearing</i>

823
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:52,333
<i>And I am elated...</i>

824
01:00:52,417 --> 01:00:53,458
<i>Elated...</i>

825
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:58,083
<i>The night's filled with restlessness...</i>

826
01:00:58,167 --> 01:00:59,458
<i>O beloved...</i>

827
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:00,375
<i>Beloved...</i>

828
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:03,125
<i>Don't forget to buy sweets for me...</i>

829
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,000
<i>But in my heart...</i>

830
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:06,042
In your heart?

831
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:10,083
<i>Something's going on in my heart.</i>

832
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,917
<i>Something's going on in my heart.</i>

833
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:24,417
-Mats for sale.
-Did you take the orange flowers?

834
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,000
-Yes, sister.
-Mats...

835
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:31,042
Hey, Vijaya.
Thank God we ran into you.

836
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:33,625
We are going to Pune for two days.

837
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,125
But Astha's staying back
because she has her exams.

838
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:38,250
Please take care of her.

839
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:40,042
Because we never let her stay alone.

840
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,417
So, we are just worried for her.

841
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:44,750
No need to worry at all.
I will take care of her.

842
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:47,333
Astha, will you eat the food made by me?

843
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:03,917
Hey!

844
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,375
-Did you make my dinner?
-Yes.

845
01:02:06,542 --> 01:02:08,625
Is the food safe to eat?

846
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,292
Why do you care?

847
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:15,667
And anyway, I am going out for dinner.

848
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:20,083
With Aditya.

849
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:22,667
I see...

850
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:24,042
How's your lover boy?

851
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,417
Did he get the car's mirror fixed yet?

852
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:28,875
Stop looking at me.

853
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:30,458
What should I do?

854
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:32,667
I don't know.
Do as you please.

855
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:45,083
It slipped my mind that
you're going out for dinner.

856
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:53,292
I really like that smell.

857
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,125
It's called fragrance.

858
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:58,083
Yes, fragrance.

859
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,083
I like it.

860
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:09,958
I never said this to you before...

861
01:03:10,042 --> 01:03:11,875
but when you keep your hair open,
you look like...

862
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:14,833
Like what?

863
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,042
Like...

864
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:19,458
Understood?

865
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,875
But he likes my hair tied up.

866
01:03:26,792 --> 01:03:27,750
Aditya?

867
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,500
Get some water for me.

868
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:38,500
Are you going to drink water here as well?

869
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:40,208
Go to your house and help yourself.

870
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:55,917
Brother.

871
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:58,375
Did you tell him about her?

872
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:03,458
It was worth watching, Shiva.
You missed it.

873
01:04:03,542 --> 01:04:04,583
I know it all.

874
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,708
She was with Aditya last night.

875
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:08,208
No.

876
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:11,083
She was eating at
Shinde Chinese Center.

877
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:14,000
And it looked like she
hadn't eaten for a year.

878
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:17,750
-What?
-Yes.

879
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:20,667
We all know Shinde's food is to die for.

880
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:23,667
She was busy eating.

881
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:29,708
She kept devouring the food.

882
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,958
Exams are fast approaching, aren't they?

883
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:45,958
What's your plan for the exams?
I will fail.

884
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:57,708
Move aside, buddy.

885
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:26,667
Dip the bread properly.

886
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:27,917
It will taste better that way.

887
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,292
What?

888
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:43,792
See you.

889
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:47,083
Wash the lunchbox before you return it.

890
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:49,500
And don't go back
to that Chinese Center.

891
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:52,583
It is not good for your health.

892
01:05:57,875 --> 01:05:58,958
Sit down.

893
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,875
-Who is it?
-Who?

894
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,917
<i>My heart...</i>
<i>Doesn't seem to agree</i>

895
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:19,083
<i>-My heart... doesn't seem to agree</i>
-Babban. Did you find someone else?

896
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:40,792
Mom wants to know if
she should send Sonu over for company.

897
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:43,083
Really? Is that what she said?

898
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:45,458
Yes?
So, should I send her over?

899
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,333
If you two are scared of being alone,
I can sleep here as well.

900
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:37,250
<i>A boy with deep brown eyes...</i>

901
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:45,625
<i>A boy with deep brown eyes...</i>

902
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:48,208
<i>Hovers over my heart...</i>

903
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:51,167
<i>Like a bee over a bud</i>

904
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:55,083
<i>Hovers over my heart...</i>
<i>Like a bee over a bud</i>

905
01:07:55,292 --> 01:07:58,458
<i>See...</i>

906
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:04,542
<i>A boy with deep brown eyes...</i>

907
01:08:17,042 --> 01:08:22,500
<i>When he talks...</i>
<i>Even the weather changes</i>

908
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:29,375
<i>Even the setting sun stops in its way</i>

909
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:35,417
<i>When he talks...</i>
<i>Even the weather changes</i>

910
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:42,000
<i>Even the setting sun stops</i>

911
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:48,000
<i>That boy with dreamy eyes...</i>

912
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:56,917
<i>That boy with dreamy eyes...</i>

913
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:59,833
<i>Makes me dreamy in the morning</i>

914
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:02,667
<i>And restless at night</i>

915
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:05,125
<i>Makes me dreamy in the morning</i>

916
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,708
<i>And restless at night</i>

917
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:10,167
<i>Look...</i>

918
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:16,208
<i>A boy with deep brown eyes...</i>

919
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:22,000
<i>A boy with deep brown eyes...</i>

920
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:11,083
Sister-in-law missed her bus, Shiva.

921
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:16,125
Hop on.

922
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,417
What are you waiting for?
Hop on.

923
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:25,125
Okay, fine.

924
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:28,000
And hold on tight.

925
01:10:32,167 --> 01:10:33,208
I am going to sail through the air.

926
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:03,292
I won't settle for anything
less than 1st rank.

927
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:09,167
Come on. Let it go.

928
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:37,000
<i>I won't settle for anything</i>
<i>less than 1st rank.</i>

929
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,333
No one makes fritters
better than Jagdish in Mumbai.

930
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,833
-Want some?
-No, I am not hungry.

931
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:09,000
Go ahead and eat it.

932
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:10,625
Otherwise,
you'll use Aditya as an excuse again...

933
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:11,792
and binge on Chinese food again.

934
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:14,000
What's your problem?

935
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:17,708
You have a problem,
that's why you stay away from me.

936
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:19,917
Staying away from you
is the only wise thing to do.

937
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,875
Guys like you know
how to take advantage.

938
01:12:22,792 --> 01:12:24,750
And anyway, I am not one of those girls.

939
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:26,292
I see...

940
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,000
But I am one of those boys.

941
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:30,500
I speak my heart out.

942
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:32,875
Well... Astha...
a single over consists of 6 balls.

943
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:34,417
It's pretty simple.

944
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:37,083
The truth is that I love you,
and I always will.

945
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,625
How many steps do you take in a day?

946
01:12:42,917 --> 01:12:43,875
I don't know.

947
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:45,042
You don't know, right?

948
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:46,500
But I can tell you.

949
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:48,000
9,600 steps.

950
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:52,083
From your home to the bus station,
you take 2,952 steps.

951
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:55,000
From the bus station to the train station,
you take 1,600 steps.

952
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:57,625
From the train station
to your college, you take 2,220 steps.

953
01:12:57,875 --> 01:13:00,292
During the college break,
you take 1,710 steps.

954
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:02,583
And the total number of steps taken
in our neighborhood are 1,118.

955
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,417
So, the total is 9,600.

956
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:07,958
That's not it.

957
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:09,542
Look.

958
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:12,625
Your fragrance,
I dab it on my handkerchief.

959
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,875
Why?

960
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,750
So that I can feel you're always around.

961
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:19,625
-What else do I need to do?
-Don't walk beside me.

962
01:13:20,292 --> 01:13:21,417
People will get a wrong idea.

963
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:23,583
It's okay.

964
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:25,958
It's only a matter of 740 steps.

965
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:30,375
Count it.

966
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:34,750
One...
two...

967
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:39,083
three... four... five...
six... seven...

968
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:16,250
And that's 740 steps.

969
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,250
42.

970
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:31,625
Is it really 742?

971
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:36,458
740.

972
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,542
See... am I really dramatic?

973
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:43,583
Will you go out for dinner with me?

974
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,083
Think about it.
My parents are coming back tomorrow.

975
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,583
You won't get another chance.

976
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,833
See you at eight.

977
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:53,958
Under the bridge.

978
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:24,208
<i>Listen to...</i>
<i>My heartbeat</i>

979
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:30,458
<i>Whenever I see your face...</i>

980
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:36,333
<i>With your goofy gait...</i>
<i>I repeat it again</i>

981
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:42,542
<i>It feels like time</i>
<i>Has stopped for me</i>

982
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:48,708
<i>Hold your heart,</i>
<i>And convince it right now...</i>

983
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:54,583
<i>I've hidden it up my sleeve</i>

984
01:15:54,833 --> 01:16:00,792
<i>It's going to stay right here...</i>

985
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:07,042
<i>As your companion</i>

986
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:13,375
<i>Listen to...</i>
<i>My heartbeat</i>

987
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:19,542
<i>Whenever I see your face...</i>

988
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:38,042
<i>In your company...</i>

989
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:46,500
<i>My heart is mischievous</i>

990
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:50,417
<i>When you knocked on my heart...</i>

991
01:16:50,542 --> 01:16:53,667
<i>I found the courage to say...</i>

992
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:59,083
<i>And my heart</i>
<i>Could not stay calm</i>

993
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:05,667
<i>The closer you came to me...</i>

994
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:11,625
<i>I feel alleviated from myself</i>

995
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,667
<i>I felt like I am out of my wits...</i>

996
01:17:18,417 --> 01:17:23,625
<i>While you stole my heart away</i>

997
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:30,292
<i>Listen to...</i>
<i>My heartbeat</i>

998
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:37,000
<i>Whenever I see your face...</i>

999
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,208
Aren't you scared?

1000
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,208
-Scared?
-Yes.

1001
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:46,458
Of what?

1002
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:49,167
Of the antics that you do all day.

1003
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:51,542
You have no lack of courage.

1004
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:55,125
But everyone does feel scared.

1005
01:17:56,167 --> 01:17:57,083
Not at all.

1006
01:17:57,833 --> 01:17:59,417
I feared my father so much...
that it actually made me fearless.

1007
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:03,667
Maybe, that's why everyone
thinks I am bitter.

1008
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:07,625
Did you feel the same before?

1009
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:15,958
Astha, can I tell you a secret?

1010
01:18:17,917 --> 01:18:19,000
I have a pet fish.

1011
01:18:20,292 --> 01:18:21,875
And she knows all my secrets.

1012
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,542
Whenever I want to take
the burden off my chest...

1013
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,500
I take a few pegs and...

1014
01:18:38,458 --> 01:18:39,500
What?

1015
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:41,292
Nothing.

1016
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:42,333
My secret is out.

1017
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:47,958
I was only wondering how many
cigarettes do you smoke in a day.

1018
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:50,792
-You know that smoking...
-Is injurious to health.

1019
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:52,792
Then?

1020
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:54,875
Take a puff and I
will quit it right now.

1021
01:18:56,167 --> 01:18:57,000
Promise.

1022
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:58,417
Deal.

1023
01:19:00,792 --> 01:19:01,792
What about alcohol?

1024
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:05,125
I'll quit it when you
share a drink with me.

1025
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:07,583
Hey!

1026
01:19:08,167 --> 01:19:09,125
You really...

1027
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,000
No more cigarettes for me.

1028
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,042
Quit it right away.

1029
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:17,500
Deal.

1030
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,333
Astha, can I ask you a question?

1031
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,625
Go ahead.

1032
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:27,333
Do you have...

1033
01:19:29,417 --> 01:19:30,750
feelings as well?

1034
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:41,375
Hail Lord Ganesha.

1035
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:45,167
I am a human being,
I do have feelings.

1036
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:48,667
What happened?

1037
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:50,042
Nothing.

1038
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,583
Shiva, where are all
these people going barefoot?

1039
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:55,292
Well, it's Tuesday you know.

1040
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,333
So?

1041
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:00,125
So, they are going to pray
at Siddhivinayak Temple.

1042
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:02,958
You never been there?

1043
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:05,000
Then let's go.

1044
01:20:05,542 --> 01:20:06,792
We'll pray together.

1045
01:20:07,917 --> 01:20:11,375
-What are you going to pray for?
-You tell me first.

1046
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:12,542
Why should I tell you?

1047
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:19,458
I am going to pray for you, Astha.

1048
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,583
I don't think I've ever
been out this late in my life.

1049
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,833
We would've never known about this,
if we hadn't returned earlier.

1050
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:46,208
Look what's going on behind our back.

1051
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:54,708
Sit.

1052
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:56,542
It's morning already.

1053
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:58,542
Let's have coffee together.

1054
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:01,208
Rajni, let's have some coffee.

1055
01:21:01,708 --> 01:21:02,833
I'd prefer some tea.

1056
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:04,833
Tea for him, please.

1057
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,583
Did you two get married?

1058
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:14,583
We only went to Siddhivinayak Temple, Dad.

1059
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,000
Do you two love each other?

1060
01:21:32,833 --> 01:21:33,792
Here 1,500 rupees.

1061
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35,042
1,400 rupees.

1062
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,750
Now 1,500 rupees.

1063
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,458
It's all yours.

1064
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:41,958
But on one condition.

1065
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:46,750
You must tell me what you're going to
do with this money in the next five hours.

1066
01:21:48,542 --> 01:21:49,708
I owe Munna 700 rupees.

1067
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:51,667
400 to the shopkeeper.

1068
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:54,208
And the rest I will spend tomorrow.

1069
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:56,083
Why tomorrow?

1070
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,583
Today is Tuesday.

1071
01:21:58,083 --> 01:21:59,333
And I don't drink on Tuesdays.

1072
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:05,917
You don't drink on Tuesdays.

1073
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:08,917
Rajni, you should have heard him.

1074
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:11,542
He doesn't drink on Tuesday.

1075
01:22:12,042 --> 01:22:15,375
You should handle this
matter more seriously.

1076
01:22:16,667 --> 01:22:18,625
Please be blunt with him.

1077
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:24,292
And if it wasn't Tuesday, then
you would've spent the rest as well.

1078
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:27,500
But you didn't give my daughter
anything from this money.

1079
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,375
First, give me your daughter...

1080
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:32,792
-and then I will...
-Give her a whack, right?

1081
01:22:33,292 --> 01:22:35,292
I mean you're used to violence.

1082
01:22:35,625 --> 01:22:37,292
I haven't seen it myself
but heard a lot about you.

1083
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:39,417
That you even hit your father.

1084
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,250
Anyway...

1085
01:22:42,417 --> 01:22:43,708
I've had enough of this coochie-coo!

1086
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,333
I'll be very clear with you.

1087
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:47,250
Astha's marriage
has already been fixed.

1088
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:49,125
Aditya is the son of my friend.

1089
01:22:49,542 --> 01:22:52,042
And they sent a proposal for Astha.

1090
01:22:53,125 --> 01:22:57,125
I've already given them my word...
and, I am a man of my word.

1091
01:22:57,875 --> 01:22:59,333
I'll send you the wedding invite.

1092
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:01,333
Do come.

1093
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,417
That money belongs to me.

1094
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:09,917
Yes, but you're a man of your word.

1095
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,375
You just said that you
gave me these 1,500 rupees.

1096
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:14,917
He's a lot worse than he looks.

1097
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:16,500
He's a conman.

1098
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:21,208
Keep it. It's your wedding gift.

1099
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,083
I will be waiting for the card, sir.

1100
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:39,417
I told you to stay away from this guy.

1101
01:23:40,167 --> 01:23:42,333
Have you lost your mind?

1102
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:47,500
Look... I think we should go somewhere
far away from this neighborhood.

1103
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:50,792
-What if...
-I trust my daughter.

1104
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:55,417
Should I... trust you?

1105
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:33,625
Father's here.

1106
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:03,208
<i>Now what next?</i>

1107
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:14,375
<i>When are your exams?</i>

1108
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:23,875
<i>Next month.</i>

1109
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:33,458
<i>Why are you not studying?</i>

1110
01:25:34,167 --> 01:25:35,875
<i>With education,</i>
<i>you can build a future for yourself.</i>

1111
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:38,542
<i>Otherwise, no girl would</i>
<i>ever want to fall in love with you.</i>

1112
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:48,625
<i>If I study properly, will you be mine?</i>

1113
01:26:37,417 --> 01:26:39,292
-What was your reply?
-I won't tell you.

1114
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:41,958
-Say it now, or I will...
-Shiva, everyone's at home.

1115
01:26:42,292 --> 01:26:45,042
Tell me... if I study properly,
will you be mine?

1116
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:46,875
Shiva, please go.

1117
01:26:47,042 --> 01:26:48,375
Then answer me.

1118
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:50,833
Yes, Dad.
I'm here.

1119
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:57,083
I wrote, "if you pass with good marks,
I will think about it".

1120
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,125
Promise?

1121
01:27:01,833 --> 01:27:02,667
Now, go.

1122
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,333
-Deal?
-Go.

1123
01:27:07,708 --> 01:27:09,583
ANNUAL EXAMS.

1124
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:42,875
Your brain's the size of a pea,
that's why it's better to copy.

1125
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:46,375
Whose is it?

1126
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:52,208
Stand up.

1127
01:27:55,125 --> 01:27:55,958
Stand up.

1128
01:27:56,083 --> 01:27:57,125
What's wrong?

1129
01:27:57,833 --> 01:28:01,250
You are cheating in your exams
and you dare to question me.

1130
01:28:01,417 --> 01:28:03,042
I am not cheating, sir.

1131
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:05,833
I am writing my exams honestly
for the first time in my life.

1132
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:07,167
Please let me write.

1133
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:12,167
I said that's not mine.

1134
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:13,250
Then whose is it?

1135
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:15,083
It must be his paper. Ask him.

1136
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,875
-It's not mine, sir.
-I know.

1137
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:20,583
Please continue writing.

1138
01:28:21,667 --> 01:28:23,958
I am saying it politely, sir.
I am not cheating.

1139
01:28:24,792 --> 01:28:25,625
Please return my sheet.

1140
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,125
Even I am saying this politely.

1141
01:28:29,792 --> 01:28:30,875
Don't touch me, sir.

1142
01:28:32,917 --> 01:28:35,417
I'll say it once again,
please let go of my collar.

1143
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:38,917
I said that's not mine.

1144
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,583
I have 1200.

1145
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,208
No, Uncle. Let it be.

1146
01:29:00,917 --> 01:29:01,958
Take it.

1147
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:06,208
And this.

1148
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:09,792
Is this 5000?

1149
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:12,125
Astha, I think you gave him 50 extra.

1150
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:16,458
Are you a gambler?

1151
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:22,125
Here you go.

1152
01:29:23,083 --> 01:29:25,667
Mohite, let him go.

1153
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:36,042
I wouldn't have regretted if you had
written your exams honestly and failed.

1154
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:37,917
But this is not the way to go about it.

1155
01:29:38,292 --> 01:29:40,625
Turn that radio off, will you?

1156
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:43,917
What now?

1157
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,583
Are you going to count
the dogs in our neighborhood...

1158
01:29:45,917 --> 01:29:47,917
or beat someone up
again on Sawant's order?

1159
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:50,958
I must have committed
some sins in my past life...

1160
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:52,583
so, I have to deal with you.

1161
01:29:53,542 --> 01:29:54,958
Even animals have some sense--

1162
01:29:58,667 --> 01:30:00,625
Stop yelling at him publicly like this.

1163
01:30:01,542 --> 01:30:03,500
It's not always his fault.

1164
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:07,208
He's a 22-year-old man.

1165
01:30:07,667 --> 01:30:10,042
Did you ever think
why he's like this?

1166
01:30:18,792 --> 01:30:20,917
Please stop here on the side.

1167
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:28,500
I think you two should get down here.

1168
01:30:30,042 --> 01:30:33,458
And please don't tell anyone that I came
down to the police station with you.

1169
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:11,667
Where were you?

1170
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:18,250
Astha's here.

1171
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:19,792
Where were you, dear?

1172
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:21,250
Adi was waiting for you.

1173
01:31:21,708 --> 01:31:22,792
It's his birthday today.

1174
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:28,875
Go get ready...

1175
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:32,542
Astha, go get ready.

1176
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:34,792
Aditya wants to take you out for dinner.

1177
01:31:36,292 --> 01:31:37,333
Go on, dear.

1178
01:31:41,417 --> 01:31:42,417
I will be right back.

1179
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:46,125
You forgot about my birthday.

1180
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,292
I will remember this.

1181
01:31:58,625 --> 01:31:59,792
Come on.

1182
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:11,833
<i>When we had to move to this small house,</i>
<i>it felt like everything shrunk.</i>

1183
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:14,167
<i>But Shiva you taught me that...</i>
<i>that one should have some place</i>

1184
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:17,667
<i>in the heart, not in a home.</i>

1185
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:23,458
<i>And I love you the way you are.</i>

1186
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:27,208
<i>Hence, I have expectations from you.</i>

1187
01:32:38,083 --> 01:32:39,208
Come on.

1188
01:32:52,875 --> 01:32:56,125
-The Queen's going to be...
-"I'll make you mine..."

1189
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:11,250
So, what next?

1190
01:33:13,333 --> 01:33:15,000
<i>I swear</i>

1191
01:33:15,667 --> 01:33:16,750
How about getting a job?

1192
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:19,667
I know someone who can help.

1193
01:33:22,167 --> 01:33:23,792
<i>I swear</i>

1194
01:33:26,583 --> 01:33:28,333
That episode is over.

1195
01:33:29,417 --> 01:33:31,625
But I think you should move ahead.

1196
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:33,417
Think about yourself.

1197
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:36,583
About myself.

1198
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:38,500
Yes, about yourself.

1199
01:33:56,208 --> 01:33:57,583
Seriously, this is what you drink?

1200
01:34:01,167 --> 01:34:02,542
You promised me that you won't.

1201
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,292
I shared a drink with you...

1202
01:34:04,417 --> 01:34:05,583
now you must quit drinking as well.

1203
01:34:09,917 --> 01:34:11,083
Sister...

1204
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:16,292
See you tomorrow.

1205
01:34:29,458 --> 01:34:31,042
<i>I swear...</i>

1206
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:39,542
<i>I'll make you mine...</i>

1207
01:34:40,167 --> 01:34:42,042
Sir, you must invest
in this company called Philips.

1208
01:34:42,667 --> 01:34:44,708
Your money will get doubled.

1209
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,625
Astha told me a lot about you.

1210
01:34:48,417 --> 01:34:50,125
What do you know about the share market?

1211
01:34:50,417 --> 01:34:51,417
Nothing.

1212
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:53,250
You will learn the game
in a couple of months.

1213
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:57,250
In the beginning,
you will have to work as an office boy.

1214
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:59,708
What will I have to do?

1215
01:34:59,875 --> 01:35:01,125
Not much.

1216
01:35:01,292 --> 01:35:04,833
My men work downstairs.

1217
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:07,542
So, you'll have to deliver
some of my messages.

1218
01:35:07,917 --> 01:35:10,917
Make tea for everyone
and get a betel leaf for me.

1219
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:15,958
And sometimes wash
my car or mop the floors of the office.

1220
01:35:16,167 --> 01:35:18,958
Are you out of your mind?
Because I am not.

1221
01:35:19,292 --> 01:35:20,667
What's wrong with you?

1222
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,875
I am not going to
mop the floors for him.

1223
01:35:31,917 --> 01:35:34,083
Astha, I only let him go
because he's your acquaintance.

1224
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,042
He thinks he can make me mop the floor.

1225
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:39,083
Shiva, no job is too small.

1226
01:35:39,792 --> 01:35:41,625
Even you think that I should
do this menial job.

1227
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:43,292
What do you want to do then?

1228
01:35:44,208 --> 01:35:45,708
Do you directly want
to be on the trading floor?

1229
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:48,542
Shiva, remember...

1230
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:50,250
profit and loss go hand-in-hand.

1231
01:35:50,458 --> 01:35:51,792
Every day is different.

1232
01:35:52,292 --> 01:35:55,208
The man you shunted...

1233
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:58,708
sold newspapers
outside this building.

1234
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:01,292
He couldn't even afford a square meal.

1235
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:05,542
And look at him now,
he's employed so many people.

1236
01:36:05,708 --> 01:36:07,542
I'll say "yes", only if
there's a future for us.

1237
01:36:08,792 --> 01:36:10,292
First, say "yes" then I'll think about it.

1238
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,458
Enough of this nonsense.

1239
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:16,042
Stop beating up others
and then you'll think.

1240
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:18,625
If you take that long, then
I'll miss an entire lifetime.

1241
01:36:19,542 --> 01:36:20,542
Don't laugh.

1242
01:36:21,250 --> 01:36:22,125
Wait for me.

1243
01:36:22,833 --> 01:36:23,833
I'll see you in a bit.

1244
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:30,542
She cares for you.

1245
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:33,542
You're a lucky man.

1246
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:39,375
Learn the tricks of
this trade and prosper.

1247
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:40,500
Here you go.

1248
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:53,250
Please...

1249
01:36:53,708 --> 01:36:54,875
You got me this job.

1250
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:57,417
This calls for a celebration with the
boys.

1251
01:36:58,042 --> 01:36:59,417
Of course, it does.

1252
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:01,083
But what about the family?

1253
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:04,500
-Family?
-Yes, family.

1254
01:37:04,833 --> 01:37:06,333
You don't know them.

1255
01:37:07,042 --> 01:37:08,167
My father will never
be happy to hear this news.

1256
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:11,125
I am sure he'll have some
complaints about this as well.

1257
01:37:12,083 --> 01:37:14,333
What's the worst that can happen?
He will be unhappy, right?

1258
01:37:14,917 --> 01:37:16,083
Well... Shiva.

1259
01:37:16,625 --> 01:37:19,125
Tell me one thing you did
to make him happy.

1260
01:37:21,042 --> 01:37:23,667
Astha, I know my father.

1261
01:37:24,875 --> 01:37:26,375
He will tear this letter apart.

1262
01:37:28,292 --> 01:37:29,125
Let him do that.

1263
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:31,000
But you must show it to him.

1264
01:37:31,583 --> 01:37:32,875
And then we will surely celebrate.

1265
01:37:45,917 --> 01:37:47,000
I have landed a job.

1266
01:37:50,833 --> 01:37:52,000
At least, take a look, will you?

1267
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,375
Is it a good position?

1268
01:38:07,833 --> 01:38:09,042
Are you happy?

1269
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:30,000
Whenever your brother won a trophy...

1270
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,042
I used to stash a
couple of bucks in them...

1271
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:38,250
with a hope that someday...
he'll bring some good news.

1272
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:41,583
Here you go.

1273
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:44,458
Get some sweets.

1274
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,667
Here.

1275
01:38:57,875 --> 01:38:59,250
Won't you hug him?

1276
01:39:18,833 --> 01:39:20,458
Will you work properly, Shiva?

1277
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:22,417
Yes, Mom.

1278
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:26,708
You can take that board off now.

1279
01:39:29,083 --> 01:39:32,042
Now you will only make savory snacks
for us, and not for the neighbors.

1280
01:39:37,333 --> 01:39:38,917
You really have matured, Shiva.

1281
01:39:46,625 --> 01:39:48,875
Shiva, where are the sweets?

1282
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:52,333
You'll get it soon.

1283
01:40:03,417 --> 01:40:06,042
-Do you have a bank account?
-No.

1284
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:08,042
But you will need one.

1285
01:40:08,542 --> 01:40:09,542
Then let's go get one.

1286
01:40:10,167 --> 01:40:11,583
Not today. Maybe later.

1287
01:40:14,458 --> 01:40:15,792
-Listen.
-Yes.

1288
01:41:50,375 --> 01:41:51,250
Yes, of course.

1289
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:01,125
Here's a form for
your bank account, Shiva.

1290
01:42:01,958 --> 01:42:02,792
Sign it.

1291
01:42:02,875 --> 01:42:04,500
We must submit it today.

1292
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:08,792
-Here you go.
-Thank you, Astha.

1293
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:11,083
Sign here.

1294
01:42:11,583 --> 01:42:12,750
And why are you thanking me?

1295
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:14,917
For this new lease of life.

1296
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:20,042
You have a nice signature.

1297
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:24,833
One more here.

1298
01:42:30,083 --> 01:42:32,708
Can we go out for dinner
when I get my first salary?

1299
01:42:33,542 --> 01:42:34,542
Just dinner.

1300
01:42:35,167 --> 01:42:36,625
What else do you want?

1301
01:42:37,833 --> 01:42:38,792
What can you give me?

1302
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:42,583
How about a ring just like this one?

1303
01:42:45,917 --> 01:42:46,958
What happened?

1304
01:42:49,125 --> 01:42:50,125
Speak up.

1305
01:42:52,542 --> 01:42:53,500
I got engaged.

1306
01:43:02,625 --> 01:43:05,958
I'll need two photos of you for the form.

1307
01:43:07,208 --> 01:43:08,083
Come on.

1308
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:11,167
When did this happen, Astha?

1309
01:43:11,625 --> 01:43:12,667
Today.

1310
01:43:13,333 --> 01:43:14,458
Now...

1311
01:43:15,042 --> 01:43:16,917
-I...
-Now, what about us?

1312
01:43:21,792 --> 01:43:22,958
Shiva, why are you doing this?

1313
01:43:24,792 --> 01:43:26,667
You won't quit this job, for my sake.

1314
01:43:26,792 --> 01:43:28,458
I was doing all this
for you in the first place.

1315
01:43:39,792 --> 01:43:41,292
Are you listening?

1316
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:44,333
Nirmala was saying that
we got the kids engaged in haste.

1317
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:46,250
But the wedding will be a grand affair.

1318
01:43:46,583 --> 01:43:47,833
Sure.

1319
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:49,625
Everything is going well, isn't it?

1320
01:43:49,833 --> 01:43:52,042
It's a nice family and a great son.

1321
01:43:52,542 --> 01:43:56,042
Otherwise, who knows where our daughter
would've ended up in this bad phase?

1322
01:44:11,708 --> 01:44:12,750
Open the door.

1323
01:44:13,208 --> 01:44:14,500
I want to talk to you.

1324
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:17,125
Open the door, Astha.

1325
01:44:18,625 --> 01:44:21,000
Astha, open the door!

1326
01:44:24,042 --> 01:44:26,083
Astha, I won't quit my job.

1327
01:44:30,542 --> 01:44:32,167
-Open the door.
-Shiva.

1328
01:44:44,042 --> 01:44:45,083
Open up.

1329
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:49,708
I want to talk to you.

1330
01:44:54,792 --> 01:44:55,792
Go on.

1331
01:44:55,958 --> 01:44:57,125
Open up.

1332
01:44:58,667 --> 01:44:59,500
-What happened?
-I don't know.

1333
01:45:02,125 --> 01:45:02,958
-Mother...
-Yes...

1334
01:45:03,042 --> 01:45:04,958
Tell her, I won't quit my job.

1335
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:10,833
I'm a changed man now.

1336
01:45:13,167 --> 01:45:14,667
-Shiva.
-Careful. Careful.

1337
01:45:14,833 --> 01:45:16,042
Haven't I completely changed, mom?

1338
01:45:20,167 --> 01:45:21,875
You changed my life.

1339
01:45:41,417 --> 01:45:43,375
Shah Sir, Nandu here.

1340
01:45:44,417 --> 01:45:46,417
Can I talk to Shiva?

1341
01:45:49,167 --> 01:45:50,000
Shiva. It's Nandu.

1342
01:45:50,333 --> 01:45:52,250
Come home quickly. Astha...

1343
01:46:29,833 --> 01:46:31,000
Where is Astha?

1344
01:46:31,167 --> 01:46:32,333
I don't know.

1345
01:46:32,667 --> 01:46:34,583
You don't know?
Tell me.

1346
01:46:35,375 --> 01:46:38,458
They used Shantaram's
vehicle for the relocation.

1347
01:46:49,542 --> 01:46:51,208
Let it be, Shiva.
Let's go.

1348
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:56,583
Let's go, Shantaram.
This is about love.

1349
01:46:59,375 --> 01:47:00,792
How much money do you want?

1350
01:47:01,125 --> 01:47:02,625
I'll ask Aditya to get it right now.

1351
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:04,417
I don't want money.

1352
01:47:04,708 --> 01:47:06,417
Then why don't you leave us alone?

1353
01:47:09,708 --> 01:47:10,875
I love her.

1354
01:47:11,917 --> 01:47:13,125
I want to talk to Astha.

1355
01:47:14,042 --> 01:47:16,083
She said she doesn't love you.

1356
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:19,833
Who said it?

1357
01:47:20,958 --> 01:47:22,000
She said it.

1358
01:47:24,458 --> 01:47:25,292
Yes.

1359
01:47:25,625 --> 01:47:26,458
Yes, she did.

1360
01:47:32,125 --> 01:47:34,917
I told him,
but he wants to hear it from you.

1361
01:47:36,542 --> 01:47:37,500
Do you love him, dear?

1362
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:39,167
Tell him.

1363
01:47:42,167 --> 01:47:43,333
Did you submit the bank account form?

1364
01:47:46,958 --> 01:47:47,958
No.

1365
01:47:48,083 --> 01:47:49,042
Then when will you get it done?

1366
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:50,833
Soon.

1367
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,292
It's important.

1368
01:47:54,583 --> 01:47:57,375
Astha, tell him how much you love me.

1369
01:48:02,292 --> 01:48:03,333
I love you a lot.

1370
01:48:06,208 --> 01:48:08,875
But I love him more.

1371
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:17,208
Just forget whatever
there was between us.

1372
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:21,083
Now, go away.

1373
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,083
Did you hear that?

1374
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:34,833
If I ever see you here again,
I'll call the cops.

1375
01:50:06,167 --> 01:50:07,125
Where are you going, dear?

1376
01:50:07,875 --> 01:50:08,792
I'm going to meet Shiva.

1377
01:50:11,208 --> 01:50:13,458
Your wedding with Aditya
is only a month away.

1378
01:50:13,625 --> 01:50:14,833
That's why I am going now.

1379
01:50:15,667 --> 01:50:17,833
Otherwise,
I will never be able to forgive myself.

1380
01:50:19,542 --> 01:50:20,375
Wait.

1381
01:50:21,417 --> 01:50:22,333
Go back inside.

1382
01:50:22,792 --> 01:50:25,042
-You are not going anywhere.
-No, Mom. Don't stop me now.

1383
01:50:26,208 --> 01:50:28,292
I always did what you said.

1384
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:30,042
And I will do it in the future as well.

1385
01:50:30,917 --> 01:50:32,708
I will marry Aditya...

1386
01:50:34,625 --> 01:50:35,917
and also learn to be happy.

1387
01:50:39,583 --> 01:50:40,875
Can I go, Mom?

1388
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:09,417
Done.

1389
01:51:13,792 --> 01:51:14,833
What happened?

1390
01:51:16,708 --> 01:51:17,792
New shirt.

1391
01:51:19,583 --> 01:51:20,458
Doesn't it look nice?

1392
01:51:21,292 --> 01:51:22,125
It does.

1393
01:51:22,792 --> 01:51:24,625
Your maroon shirt is also nice.

1394
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:26,583
Maroon?

1395
01:51:26,708 --> 01:51:28,167
Your dark maroon shirt...

1396
01:51:28,708 --> 01:51:30,625
with a slightly torn pocket...

1397
01:51:31,125 --> 01:51:32,833
and it has an ink stain on the collar.

1398
01:51:33,708 --> 01:51:34,958
Ink stain on my shirt?

1399
01:51:35,417 --> 01:51:36,542
Of course. So what?

1400
01:51:36,917 --> 01:51:38,833
It's also on your other
shirt with red checks...

1401
01:51:39,250 --> 01:51:40,208
on the right sleeve.

1402
01:51:41,583 --> 01:51:42,542
Right?

1403
01:51:45,375 --> 01:51:46,792
On the right sleeve.

1404
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:50,417
How many shirts do I have?

1405
01:51:51,458 --> 01:51:52,500
12...

1406
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:54,375
13... including this one.

1407
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,750
Four T-shirts and three vests.

1408
01:51:58,875 --> 01:52:03,000
And the white one with three holes...

1409
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:05,333
here...

1410
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:07,625
here...

1411
01:52:08,042 --> 01:52:09,000
and here.

1412
01:52:11,333 --> 01:52:12,792
And when you wear it...
you look...

1413
01:52:22,208 --> 01:52:24,958
Do you really love me that much?

1414
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:28,375
Tell me, Astha.

1415
01:52:36,917 --> 01:52:38,000
Come on.

1416
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:39,333
Where?

1417
01:53:55,792 --> 01:53:56,875
Who is he?

1418
01:53:58,042 --> 01:54:01,000
He's Aakash and that's Reena.
My friends.

1419
01:54:01,792 --> 01:54:03,250
And we're in her house now.

1420
01:54:05,333 --> 01:54:06,375
What?

1421
01:56:01,667 --> 01:56:03,125
Let's get married.

1422
01:56:09,167 --> 01:56:10,917
Shiva, we cannot get married.

1423
01:56:12,583 --> 01:56:13,625
What?

1424
01:56:21,625 --> 01:56:24,208
I will spend the rest of my life
with these memories.

1425
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,875
I love you and I always will...

1426
01:56:33,958 --> 01:56:35,333
But we cannot get married.

1427
01:56:37,542 --> 01:56:39,083
I know you will...

1428
01:56:39,958 --> 01:56:40,875
but what about me?

1429
01:56:42,792 --> 01:56:44,583
I cannot live with only your memories.

1430
01:56:45,292 --> 01:56:47,667
I want you, Astha...
for the rest of my life.

1431
01:56:49,625 --> 01:56:50,625
Let's get married.

1432
01:56:54,917 --> 01:56:56,167
I will be doomed.

1433
01:57:01,625 --> 01:57:05,000
You always listen to your heart,
but unfortunately, I cannot.

1434
01:57:06,583 --> 01:57:10,333
My heart's saying one thing and
my mind's saying another.

1435
01:57:10,583 --> 01:57:12,375
Then set your mind straight.

1436
01:57:12,583 --> 01:57:14,375
It is in the right place...

1437
01:57:15,917 --> 01:57:18,375
that's why I am marrying Aditya.

1438
01:57:19,542 --> 01:57:21,542
Papa already suffered two heart attacks.

1439
01:57:22,167 --> 01:57:23,333
Deepu's still young.

1440
01:57:24,042 --> 01:57:26,792
And only I know how
Mom's managing everything.

1441
01:57:31,083 --> 01:57:34,833
I cannot ruin their lives
for the sake of my own.

1442
01:57:39,042 --> 01:57:40,708
Forgive me.

1443
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:42,667
Do you think it's easy?

1444
01:57:44,458 --> 01:57:46,500
Will you be happy if
you marry someone else?

1445
01:57:48,583 --> 01:57:49,958
What's wrong with you, Astha?

1446
01:57:54,375 --> 01:57:55,417
No!

1447
01:58:04,083 --> 01:58:05,458
I have to go, Shiva.

1448
01:58:06,333 --> 01:58:07,292
No.

1449
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:11,542
I have to go.

1450
01:58:12,042 --> 01:58:12,875
No.

1451
01:58:12,958 --> 01:58:14,583
I promised Mom...

1452
01:58:34,083 --> 01:58:36,667
We cannot meet again.
The wedding is happening next month.

1453
01:58:36,917 --> 01:58:37,875
How is that possible?

1454
01:58:38,958 --> 01:58:39,958
We will meet again, Astha.

1455
01:58:41,417 --> 01:58:43,208
You made a promise to your parents.

1456
01:58:44,333 --> 01:58:45,417
But I will talk to them.

1457
01:58:47,625 --> 01:58:50,958
-No one's going to listen to you.
-But I still want to try...

1458
01:58:53,625 --> 01:58:55,958
Otherwise, I'll have this
remorse for the rest of my life.

1459
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,333
That I never tried to convince them.

1460
01:58:59,208 --> 01:59:01,208
-Is it that easy?
-Of course, it is.

1461
01:59:02,208 --> 01:59:03,875
Was it easy to make me a changed man?

1462
01:59:04,875 --> 01:59:05,958
But you did.

1463
01:59:07,292 --> 01:59:08,958
Can't I even try talking to your father?

1464
01:59:10,333 --> 01:59:12,083
I am sure he will listen to me.

1465
01:59:13,875 --> 01:59:16,208
Shiva, you think I didn't try.

1466
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,042
This is our reality.
This is where it ends.

1467
01:59:22,417 --> 01:59:26,667
You know, Astha. I made it
pretty clear to Santosh the tailor...

1468
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:29,333
that I am going to
wear a Tuxedo at my wedding.

1469
01:59:31,917 --> 01:59:34,625
I wonder how our home will be.

1470
01:59:36,125 --> 01:59:37,458
And our kids...

1471
01:59:38,792 --> 01:59:40,042
I wonder how will they look?

1472
01:59:43,583 --> 01:59:44,542
Look?

1473
01:59:45,292 --> 01:59:46,708
I am serious...

1474
01:59:46,792 --> 01:59:49,167
Don't get me wrong, Shiva.

1475
01:59:49,792 --> 01:59:51,500
I laughed because...

1476
01:59:53,708 --> 01:59:56,042
do you realize
that you have dreams now?

1477
01:59:56,750 --> 01:59:58,125
Is it wrong to dream?

1478
01:59:58,750 --> 02:00:00,292
Everyone should dream.

1479
02:00:00,625 --> 02:00:01,667
Of course, Shiva.

1480
02:00:02,125 --> 02:00:04,125
All those who thought you were useless...

1481
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:05,667
I want you to give
them a fitting reply.

1482
02:00:06,583 --> 02:00:08,000
-Without you.
-What?

1483
02:00:09,625 --> 02:00:10,583
Without you.

1484
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:12,792
You will get used to it soon.

1485
02:00:14,083 --> 02:00:16,083
Oh no... Reena's house keys.

1486
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:18,125
She will kill me.
I'll go put it back.

1487
02:00:18,333 --> 02:00:20,000
Don't go anywhere.
Wait here for me. Okay.

1488
02:00:20,667 --> 02:00:21,625
I'll be right back.

1489
02:01:18,083 --> 02:01:18,917
Yes.

1490
02:01:26,958 --> 02:01:30,875
Hey, catch it. Serve it.

1491
02:01:36,875 --> 02:01:37,958
Hey... come here.

1492
02:01:38,583 --> 02:01:40,333
-What happened, sir?
-Where does Shiva More live?

1493
02:01:40,417 --> 02:01:41,542
Where is his house?

1494
02:01:41,958 --> 02:01:42,833
Over there.

1495
02:01:43,833 --> 02:01:45,375
It's over there.

1496
02:01:45,625 --> 02:01:46,500
Yes.

1497
02:01:46,625 --> 02:01:47,500
What's wrong, sir?

1498
02:01:47,583 --> 02:01:48,542
Wait a minute.

1499
02:01:49,333 --> 02:01:50,500
-Please come down.
-What happened?

1500
02:01:50,708 --> 02:01:51,833
Yes... come down.

1501
02:01:52,375 --> 02:01:53,500
Please come down.

1502
02:03:16,542 --> 02:03:21,500
<i>A remorse that I have...</i>

1503
02:03:22,167 --> 02:03:27,583
<i>A remorse...</i>

1504
02:03:27,792 --> 02:03:33,417
<i>A remorse that I have...</i>

1505
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:37,917
<i>A remorse...</i>

1506
02:03:39,042 --> 02:03:47,667
<i>Weaving a web of animosity...</i>

1507
02:03:50,375 --> 02:03:55,958
<i>A remorse that I have...</i>

1508
02:03:56,042 --> 02:04:01,167
<i>A remorse...</i>

1509
02:04:25,917 --> 02:04:31,542
<i>A date to perish has been written</i>

1510
02:04:31,625 --> 02:04:36,917
<i>On my thoughts</i>

1511
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:41,958
<i>A wish has now been placed</i>

1512
02:04:42,042 --> 02:04:46,750
<i>On my breath forever</i>

1513
02:04:46,833 --> 02:04:52,583
<i>A question that still lurks</i>

1514
02:04:52,667 --> 02:04:58,042
<i>In the misfortunes...</i>

1515
02:04:58,125 --> 02:05:03,750
<i>A remorse that I have...</i>

1516
02:05:03,833 --> 02:05:08,958
<i>A remorse...</i>

1517
02:05:09,417 --> 02:05:17,708
<i>Weaving a web of animosity...</i>

1518
02:05:20,375 --> 02:05:26,208
<i>A remorse that I have...</i>

1519
02:05:26,292 --> 02:05:31,667
<i>A remorse...</i>

1520
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:38,208
Here. This is Astha's diary.

1521
02:06:28,667 --> 02:06:29,792
Hey, Astha.

1522
02:06:30,958 --> 02:06:32,208
When did you arrive?

1523
02:06:34,667 --> 02:06:38,292
Has it ever happened that you
thought of me and I didn't show up?

1524
02:06:43,708 --> 02:06:44,875
You look beautiful.

1525
02:06:44,958 --> 02:06:46,667
I always do.

1526
02:06:47,208 --> 02:06:49,583
So, why were you thinking of me?

1527
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:52,917
I was just missing you.

1528
02:06:53,625 --> 02:06:55,625
I keep saying that you should get married.

1529
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:57,292
Even your hair...

1530
02:07:00,375 --> 02:07:02,083
is turning grey.

1531
02:07:03,042 --> 02:07:05,375
Then let's get married.

1532
02:07:08,167 --> 02:07:09,375
Don't you want to go home?

1533
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,417
Mom must be waiting for you.

1534
02:07:15,708 --> 02:07:18,667
You come along as well.

1535
02:07:20,458 --> 02:07:22,250
What was I before I met you?

1536
02:07:23,625 --> 02:07:24,583
Nothing.

1537
02:07:26,833 --> 02:07:28,792
Your love changed my life.

1538
02:07:30,458 --> 02:07:32,417
That's why I keep telling you...
"let's go home."

1539
02:07:35,417 --> 02:07:37,042
I wish I could, Shiva.

1540
02:07:42,542 --> 02:07:45,000
Go.
Mom must be alone.

1541
02:07:46,333 --> 02:07:49,500
You came late and now
you're asking me to go.

1542
02:07:50,875 --> 02:07:52,250
What if I couldn't come at all?

1543
02:07:53,208 --> 02:07:55,750
Has it ever happened that
I thought of you and you didn't show up?

1544
02:07:56,042 --> 02:07:56,917
I see...

1545
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,875
You are using my lines on me.

1546
02:08:00,208 --> 02:08:02,542
How's work?

1547
02:08:03,375 --> 02:08:04,625
It's good.

1548
02:08:04,708 --> 02:08:08,583
I feel really happy when
I employ someone like me.
