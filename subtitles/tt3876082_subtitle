1
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,540
Here come the boys
from UK.

2
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, I won't be
able to play golf today.

3
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,920
My phone predicts bad weather
in the afternoon.

4
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,920
Then?
- What else?

5
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,790
I will stay at home
and serve you.

6
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,960
Stop it.

7
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,630
You start this from
the morning itself.

8
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,130
Bitter gourd juice, uncle.

9
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,580
I made a mistake by
getting the test done.

10
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,290
I wonder what else
they will make me drink.

11
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,330
Shut up and drink it.

12
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,420
How many times do I have
to tell you that I am fine?

13
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,880
You can make me empty
a trailer full of sand manually.

14
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,040
Now the doctor's orders will
be followed, not yours, uncle.

15
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,830
Drink it quietly.

16
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,830
Fine.

17
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,420
I'll drink it.

18
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,920
Call Roopinder, her darling son.

19
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,380
Mr. Garewal,
is he only my darling son?

20
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,170
What's the hurry?
He will come.

21
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,960
Yes, right. He doesn't
have to go to the office.

22
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,420
Good morning, mom.
- Good morning, son.

23
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,960
Hi, dad. Good morning.

24
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Channo, get me
some 'Paranthas'.

25
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,420
Also get some butter.

26
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,420
Dad, eat some veggies.

27
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,250
Teasing your father?

28
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,500
Didn't you start it? He said he
doesn't have to go the office.

29
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,040
Now say something.
Why are you so quiet now?

30
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,330
What can he say?
He has left no work for me.

31
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,290
He's made so much money
that our four generations

32
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,040
can live comfortably.

33
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,290
Have fun at your father's cost.

34
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,920
I have all the fun I can.

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,040
I don't start something
that I cannot finish.

36
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,710
Why don't you go for
an international vacation?

37
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,540
Why should I? Just like that?

38
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,920
'Paranthas!'

39
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,170
Who will feed me these there
with such affection?

40
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,750
You aren't getting any.
Eat your cornflakes.

41
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,170
Yes, Bholi.
Tell me what happened?

42
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,330
The place where we wanted
to fix Roopinder's marriage.

43
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,920
Yes? - I don't think
it will work out.

44
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,920
They want their girl
to marry an NRI, aunt.

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,170
This is the limit.

46
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,170
They haven't been beyond Moga.

47
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,580
And they want an NRI
for their daughter.

48
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,380
Tell them I don't want my son
to marry their daughter.

49
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,630
They think they are great.
- Who was it?

50
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,830
Everyone wants to go abroad
these days.

51
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,080
They say they want an NRI groom.

52
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,920
Why? What's wrong
with boys from Punjab?

53
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,960
Right.

54
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,040
A donkey is making a fuss.

55
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,500
They have locked up their
destiny by saying no to our son.

56
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,420
My son can hire
50 employees. Right?

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why? What was I saying?

58
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,330
If you would've gone abroad

59
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,460
then families having daughters
would've been running after you.

60
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,330
I cannot marry
just any girl, dad.

61
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,460
As soon as I see the girl
I want to marry I should..

62
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,880
What should happen?

63
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,040
I should lose my senses.

64
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,670
Be careful, son.

65
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,960
Those who make
people lose their mind

66
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,420
usually dominate their husbands.

67
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,420
Oh really? What do you mean?
What do you mean by that?

68
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,290
You mean mom has
locked you in a cage?

69
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,000
I didn't say that.

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,170
I always take care of you
and you say such things to me.

71
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,750
Hear that.
- Continue. I am leaving.

72
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,250
I don't look after you, my love?

73
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,540
Son, where are you going?

74
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,960
In search of the one who
will make me lose my mind.

75
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,670
Good luck.

76
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,920
Uncle, your medicine
with warm water.

77
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,170
I don't want it.

78
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,540
You will have to.
I've locked him up in a cage.

79
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,420
Have your medicine.

80
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,630
Bye-Bye India Marriage Bureau

81
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,130
Daljeet Jugaadi?

82
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,580
What is he up to?

83
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,920
Bye-Bye India Marriage Bureau
Only foreign marriage alliances

84
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,540
Hello, mister!

85
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,880
First fill up the form then
I'll arrange a meeting with sir.

86
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,250
He might be a sir for you,
he's my buddy.

87
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,670
'Wow!'

88
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,460
Wonderful!

89
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,750
All by yourself!

90
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,250
What a pair!

91
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,290
Shake hands!

92
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,670
Forget the hand shake,
give me a hug.

93
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,750
Good to see you after so long,
buddy. - Same here.

94
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,790
You are doing well.

95
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,380
See for yourself.
Doesn't it look grand?

96
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,460
What is this?

97
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,000
You met Obama?

98
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,750
It's fake, right?

99
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,250
No. He really is Obama.

100
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,040
I am the fake one.

101
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,750
All the universities
give paper degrees.

102
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,040
I am the one who makes careers.
That too in dollars and pounds.

103
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,500
This is what is called cutting
the cake and having it too.

104
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,460
Have a seat.
Let's sit and talk.

105
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,580
We are meeting
after a long time.

106
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,170
Has someone accepted you

107
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,580
or is your status just
like mine, 'applied for'?

108
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,420
This means you too
are single like me.

109
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,330
My friend now the whole world
is in my hands.

110
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,580
Close your eyes and place your
finger anywhere on the globe.

111
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,330
Let me know from which country
do you want the girl to be.

112
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,540
And you my friend
are hero material.

113
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,750
You won't even need an airplane.
She will take you in her hands.

114
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,920
These are the pictures of girls
who stay abroad.

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,880
See if you like any.

116
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,790
I can go abroad anytime I want.

117
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,380
My family will feel lonely.

118
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,290
'It's you..'

119
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,710
'It's you..'

120
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,670
'It's you, I desire.'

121
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,040
'It's you..'

122
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,540
'It's you..'

123
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,580
'It's you, I desire.'

124
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,540
'I have devoted them to you.'

125
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,420
'I have lost them to you.'

126
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,330
'I have devoted them to you.'

127
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,580
'I have lost them to you.'

128
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,580
'My eyes only worship you.'

129
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,170
'It's you..'

130
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,580
'It's you..'

131
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,420
'It's you, I desire.'

132
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,040
'It's you..'

133
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,420
'It's you..'

134
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,330
'It's you, I desire.'

135
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,880
'It's you..'

136
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,330
'It's you..'

137
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,170
'It's you, I desire.'

138
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,580
'It's you..'

139
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,080
'It's you..'

140
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,250
'It's you, I desire.'

141
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,920
'Now nothing that
I have belongs to me.'

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,170
'Nothing's mine.'

143
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,670
'Whatever I have is yours.'

144
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,040
'It's all yours.'

145
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,040
'Now nothing that
I have belongs to me.'

146
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,210
'Whatever I have is yours.'

147
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,750
'You are the one
in front of me.'

148
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,290
'You are the one away from me.'

149
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,750
'You are the one
who keeps quiet.'

150
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,170
'You are the one who speaks.'

151
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,670
'You are the one
in front of me.'

152
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,040
'You are the one away from me.'

153
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,580
'You are the one
who keeps quiet.'

154
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,920
'You are the one who speaks.'

155
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,130
'Being with you has
made my loneliness go away.'

156
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,790
'It's you..'

157
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,210
'It's you..'

158
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,750
'It's you..'

159
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,170
'It's you..'

160
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,080
'It's you, I desire.'

161
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,460
'It's you..'

162
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,040
'It's you..'

163
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,880
'It's you, I desire.'

164
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,330
'It's you..'

165
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,830
'It's you..'

166
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,790
'It's you, I desire.'

167
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,210
'It's you..'

168
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,750
'It's you..'

169
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,670
'It's you, I desire.'

170
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,580
'The claims the eyes make.'

171
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,420
'The claims the eyes make.'

172
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,040
'They claim a right
over your face.'

173
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,540
'They don't look away.'

174
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,580
'The day and night
belongs to you.'

175
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,330
'The sunshine and the rains too
belong to you.'

176
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,460
'The day and night
belongs to you.'

177
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,330
'The sunshine and the rains too
belong to you.'

178
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,420
'I have given my fate
in your hands.'

179
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,170
'It's you..'

180
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,580
'It's you..'

181
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,960
'It's you..'

182
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,460
'It's you..'

183
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,420
'It's you, I desire.'

184
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,920
'It's you..'

185
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,420
'It's you..'

186
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,290
'It's you, I desire.'

187
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,750
'It's you..'

188
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,210
'It's you..'

189
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,040
'It's you, I desire.'

190
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,580
'It's you..'

191
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,040
'It's you..'

192
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,920
'It's you, I desire.'

193
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,670
Hello?

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,540
Where did you get lost,
young man? You went by air.

195
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,790
This coffee was hot
when it came.

196
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,830
Now it has become a cold drink.

197
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,290
I have lost my mind.

198
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,330
I found the one
I was looking for.

199
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,540
Oh really?

200
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,580
Let me look at the angel who
made my friend lose his mind.

201
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,080
Hey, she is an Indian. A local.

202
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,540
That makes things easier.

203
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,750
Lift your foot from the
accelerator and hit the brakes.

204
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,170
Keep your engine cool, my boy.

205
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,960
Why? - Try taking a simple
path at least sometimes.

206
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,460
You messed with the
non-medical in college.

207
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,670
You ended up giving
supplementary exams, didn't you?

208
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,420
Once again you are placing
you hand on the wrong thing.

209
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,330
This is the first time I have
chosen something right

210
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,420
and you say it is wrong.

211
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,080
Pal, her father will
marry her to an NRI beggar

212
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,710
but he refuses the proposal
from even a king who stays here.

213
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,830
That's nothing great.

214
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,710
Give me her name and address.
I'll take care of it.

215
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:43,250
Okay. If you insist, her
details are behind the photo.

216
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,000
Take it.

217
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,170
Disha Dhillon,
daughter of Dilip Singh Dhillon.

218
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,460
Village Kheri. 9815292359.

219
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,750
Let's go.
- Where?

220
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,960
To meet Disha.

221
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,420
What's wrong?
He's home early today.

222
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,580
Strange.
- Welcome.

223
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,710
You are all smiles today.

224
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,130
Did you find someone special?

225
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,750
Both of you worry
about getting me married.

226
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,920
I thought I should get married.
- Really, Roopinder?

227
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,330
With any girl?

228
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,880
Not with any girl, mom.
With one girl.

229
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,670
As soon as I saw her I felt

230
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,750
she is the one
who will look after my mother.

231
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,040
Was it written
on her forehead that

232
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,960
she'll look after
her mother-in-law?

233
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,330
Stop joking.

234
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,000
If you like the girl
then I too like her.

235
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,880
What is her name?
Where is she from?

236
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,790
Disha Dhillon,
daughter of Dilip Singh Dhillon.

237
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,460
Village and post office Kheri.
It's nearby.

238
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,580
Look, dear,
the way he is behaving I feel

239
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,040
you'll have to make
her your daughter-in-law.

240
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,790
You always keep cracking jokes.

241
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,670
I will talk to her family.

242
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,040
Hello. I cannot
just swallow pills.

243
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,960
I can talk as well.

244
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,880
She wants to talk
to the girls family!

245
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,330
So, do you have
their contact number?

246
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,460
9815292359.

247
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,670
Great.

248
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,580
He has memorized it
as if it is of some helpline.

249
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,170
Dad, it's not the girl's number.
It's her father's.

250
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,040
Father! You call me dad and you
are already showing him respect.

251
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,460
Are you calling him or not?
- Have I ever said no to you?

252
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,130
I will call even
if the line is dead.

253
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,960
So, shall I call him up, son?

254
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,000
Call him up.
We'll see what happens.

255
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,920
981..
- 9815292359.

256
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,750
Oh really?

257
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,830
Oh!

258
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,960
Hello?

259
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,330
Dhillon speaking.

260
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,330
Hello, Mr. Dhillon.
- Hello.

261
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,710
I am Harjeet Singh Garewal
from Gilla.

262
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,290
Garewal from Gilla?
- Yes.

263
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,210
Yes, tell me.

264
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,130
I want to meet you regarding
my son's marriage proposal.

265
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,670
Most welcome.
You can come any time you want.

266
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,750
If you don't mind, can you
tell me what your son does.

267
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,420
We have millions rotting.

268
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,880
We have 50 acres of land.

269
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,920
He's my only son.

270
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,580
And you ask me
what my son does.

271
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,830
Mr. Garewal, you can come
any time you want.

272
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,420
But don't mind

273
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,210
I am looking for an NRI boy
for my daughter.

274
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,540
Why, Mr. Dhillon? Aren't boys
from Punjab good enough

275
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,380
that you don't want
your daughter to marry them?

276
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,540
You are insulting me.

277
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,460
You are humiliating
the whole of Punjab.

278
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,790
I didn't open my doors for you

279
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,460
and you wish to sunbath
in my courtyard?

280
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,670
She is my daughter. I can
get her married anywhere I want.

281
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,330
I don't understand
what you want.

282
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,290
People check the family,
the prospective groom.

283
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,580
And you are adamant
on the groom being an NRI.

284
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,790
Excuse me, but I am
not pleased to speak to you.

285
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,630
I too am not very happy.

286
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,540
It would be better
if we end this here.

287
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,330
Don't need to chant a mantra
to end the conversation.

288
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,330
Dad? - Disconnect the line
and the conversation will end.

289
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,210
This conversation is over.

290
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,040
Don't call me henceforth,
even by mistake.

291
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,080
You hit hard.

292
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,960
Is this any way
to talk to someone?

293
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,290
What all should I teach you?

294
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,330
Sorry, son.
I spoke to him at your request.

295
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,960
But I think this Dhillon
is not an easy person.

296
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,460
You should forget that girl.
- Dad

297
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,250
We will find someone else.

298
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,330
Who is he to teach me?

299
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,420
I want to send
my daughter abroad.

300
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,290
Do foreigners talk like this?

301
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,170
We Indians aren't that bad.

302
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,170
Stop defending him.

303
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,420
I have seen a lot when I was
in Germany for two years.

304
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,000
Only foreigners know
how to live life.

305
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,580
What can we do about my problem?
- I have a solution.

306
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,670
What?

307
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,750
Forget her.

308
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,170
Shut up!

309
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,830
What kind of a person are you?

310
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,170
Have you never been in love?

311
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,790
I am in love with her.

312
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,670
You are in love, my brother.

313
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,670
But her father wants an NRI.
And you are not one.

314
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,290
So your love story ends here.

315
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,170
How can it end here?

316
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,460
Now there's just
one aim in my life.

317
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,580
To be with Disha.

318
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,790
Wonderful.

319
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,460
You seem to have fallen in love.

320
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,960
If it is so then
what's the problem?

321
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,080
Then be an NRI.

322
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,670
You mean I should go abroad.
Settle there and then come back.

323
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,830
By then her old man will marry
her off to someone in Muscat.

324
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,960
My boy, I told you to be
an NRI, not become one.

325
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,460
Try to understand
what I mean to say.

326
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,330
Why do you talk about
things that can get us thrashed?

327
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,330
Wonderful.

328
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,580
You want to love but you
are scared of getting thrashed.

329
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,830
Wonderful.

330
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,670
For how long can
we survive as fakes?

331
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,460
Till her father doesn't agree.

332
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,330
What about when he
finds out the truth?

333
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,830
Nothing. You can
tell the girl the truth

334
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,170
that you had to do
this drama to be with her.

335
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,790
Otherwise her father
wouldn't have agreed.

336
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,040
The girl will kill me.
It is not that easy.

337
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,330
Yes. You are wrong over here.

338
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,920
My boy, love is a disease
that has no cure.

339
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,290
No matter where in the world
you take the patient.

340
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,170
Just sweet talk her
into calling you sweetheart.

341
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,880
Once she calls you sweetheart

342
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,290
she will go against her family.

343
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,210
There is no other option?
- There is.

344
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,380
The one I told you
about earlier. Forget her.

345
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,540
She is in my memory card.
Now I cannot remove her.

346
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,790
Fine then.
You don't have to worry.

347
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,460
Make noise. Tell the world

348
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,880
that modern boys
can make commitment too.

349
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,580
Ranjha became a shepherd
for 12 years for Heer.

350
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,880
Can't you become someone else
for her father for some time?

351
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,500
I am feeling scared.

352
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,170
But it's okay.

353
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,330
We'll see what happens.
Come on, make preparations.

354
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,080
What do you mean?

355
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,460
You have to make
the preparations.

356
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,710
That's your job.

357
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,460
My brother, you are
the director of this film.

358
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,880
You will have to handle
if anything goes wrong, right?

359
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,420
I can handle things.
It's not a problem.

360
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,420
But I will be with you
only in the beginning.

361
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,290
I'll start the film
and then leave.

362
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,330
You will have to take the film
to its end on your own.

363
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,290
Fine.
- Fine?

364
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,290
But which country does
the hero of your film belong to?

365
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,920
He can be of any country.
All of them are the same.

366
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,960
Is it good?

367
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,750
It's great.

368
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,460
So, this is a map.

369
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,460
I never said
it's a painting of horses.

370
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,460
I am just informing you.
- Where's Southall?

371
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,210
Southall? I just printed
the map from the internet.

372
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,040
I too couldn't find Southall.

373
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,830
But it's here somewhere.

374
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,040
You just need to remember that.

375
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,920
You stay on Gilford street
in house number 118

376
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,040
and I stay in 119.

377
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,880
Don't worry much about London.
Keep talking about Southall.

378
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,830
There are only a few things
to remember about London.

379
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,080
Remember the London bridge.

380
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,960
Remember the Big Ben.
A huge bell.

381
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,330
Remember London Eye.
- What is London Eye?

382
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,920
London Eye.
The wooden swing in our village?

383
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,710
Yes? - These foreigners have
made a huge one made of steel.

384
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,040
Don't bother about it.

385
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,420
And Piccadilly Circus.
- Piccadilly Circus?

386
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,580
Circus.

387
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,920
It's not the regular type.

388
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,540
Dirty kind of shows
take place over there.

389
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,420
A lot of Punjabis go
to watch them, but we don't.

390
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,540
It reduces our score.
- Okay.

391
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,000
Anything else about Southall?

392
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,920
Just remember we drink at
Glassi Junction in the evenings.

393
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,290
We go to watch the
'Baisakhi' fair at Park Avenue.

394
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,960
And we eat
at the Jalebi Junction.

395
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,790
And whenever you get stuck just
go back to the big Gurudwara.

396
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,880
We go to the big Gurudwara
quite often.

397
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,540
Don't go beyond that
or we will be in trouble.

398
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,460
That's it then. It's good.

399
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,460
We will keep discussing
as we progress.

400
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,210
Right?
Shall we make a move?

401
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,330
Make a move? Wait. Does
your aunt stay at Kheri village?

402
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,540
Where will you stay?

403
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,920
Let me make arrangements
for our stay. - Do it.

404
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,540
Hello!
- Hello?

405
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,460
Hello?
Deep! How are you?

406
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,040
I am doing great,
brother Jugaadi.

407
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,580
I am in London,
all thanks to you.

408
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,540
Else, I would've been enjoying
the police station in Ludhiana.

409
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,170
Listen, I need your help.

410
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,210
Two of us want to stay
in your farmhouse at Kheri.

411
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,580
No problem, brother.

412
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,880
My cousin Moni stays there.
I'll call him up.

413
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,330
Yes, call him up and tell him

414
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,710
that your two friends
are coming from UK.

415
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,920
Don't say Jirakpur.
Say, we are from UK, okay?

416
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,420
What's this all about, brother?

417
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,580
I'll let you know
some other time.

418
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,880
Call him up and say that your
friends are coming over from UK.

419
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,130
Bye.

420
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,460
This is a nice fix you
have found, you scoundrel.

421
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,210
No cursing. Boys and girls don't
curse in this manner in UK.

422
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,290
They curse in sign language.
I'll teach you that as well.

423
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,210
Okay?

424
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,130
Our syllabus is over.
Can we go now?

425
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,830
We will have to go now.

426
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,130
Yeah.
- Yeah?

427
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,040
You still aren't done puking?

428
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,040
Give me a second.

429
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,750
Not a government treasury that
can be cleaned out in no time.

430
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,710
Careful with that,
or you might pop your eyes out.

431
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,670
My eyes always yearn
to see you.

432
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,460
How can they just pop out?

433
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,170
I didn't let even a drop of
locally brewed stay inside me.

434
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,460
Deep had called.

435
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,960
There's a scotch
coming from UK.

436
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,960
You start counting chickens
before the eggs are hatched.

437
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,170
Madam.
- Yes?

438
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,330
You can hatch eggs later. Keeda
has brought someone with him.

439
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,670
Who is it?

440
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,880
Your guests with
ugly faces have come.

441
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,670
God bless you, Keeda.

442
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,250
My bottle of scotch is here!

443
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,670
Welcome.

444
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,960
Hi.
- Hello.

445
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,170
Hi, how are you?
- I'm Moni.

446
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,670
She's my wife. Mitho.

447
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,500
Hi.

448
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,420
She is shy.

449
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,420
She has accepted
your greetings.

450
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,330
Hello, sister Mitho.

451
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,040
Let's shake hands.

452
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,960
He says she is shy,
but her hands are firm.

453
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,170
She is very frank while
shaking hands, I guess.

454
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,580
Nice couple, huh?

455
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,880
Yeah.
- Not slippers, just sliders.

456
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,210
She wears sandals sometimes.
She wore them for our wedding.

457
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,040
You are late.

458
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,040
My throat has gone dry
waiting for you.

459
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,420
My bus was late.

460
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,420
Airbus.

461
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,080
Plane is also called airbus.

462
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,420
It means the same.

463
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,040
Be grateful for I met them,
they were wandering around.

464
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,920
See you, telephone exchange.

465
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Bye.

466
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,920
He cracks funny jokes.
- Yeah.

467
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,040
I know he's a funny guy.
- Yeah.

468
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,170
I like it.
- Nice place, eh?

469
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,040
Deep has made it
for us to enjoy.

470
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,040
He sends us clothes too.

471
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,710
This is as good as UK for us.
We eat and drink well.

472
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,080
We are fed up of
having junk food in UK.

473
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,330
Now we are here
to have some greens.

474
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,420
Don't you worry.

475
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,830
We'll feed you so many greens
that your navel will turn green.

476
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,290
You can ask around
if you want to.

477
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,540
Navel?
- Ask around?

478
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,670
Oh, I know.
Local language, you know.

479
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,460
Okay! He's a rustic!

480
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,880
Rustic!

481
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,170
Still rustic?

482
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,960
Okay, Mithe..
- I'm Moni.

483
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,540
My wife's Mitho. Order me.

484
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,670
Oh, so sorry.

485
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,040
I wanted to ask

486
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,170
will you just keeping talking
or show us our rooms as well?

487
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,330
Yes.

488
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,750
Thanks for reminding.
Shera!

489
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,460
Take their luggage and
show them their room. - Yes.

490
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,540
Freshen up and then we'll drink.
- Okay.

491
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,080
Which scotch have you
brought with you?

492
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,790
Hey.
- Scotch?

493
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,040
Customs officials have held
the bag with Scotch.

494
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,330
We'll get it by
day after tomorrow.

495
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,250
What if they drink it all?
- Yes.

496
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,170
No, I drank a little from it
before leaving it behind.

497
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,040
They don't drink
from an unsealed bottle.

498
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,750
I puked the locally brewed
liquor anticipating the scotch.

499
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,040
And it is still at the airport.

500
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,420
Fine. Follow Shera.

501
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,420
Okay. See you guys.

502
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,750
You jinxed it.

503
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,960
You are riding busted bikes.
Are you guys idiots?

504
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,290
Watch it!
I'll give you a tight slap.

505
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,790
We're from UK.
- Okay.

506
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,170
You should be polite, brother.

507
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,330
You should know
how to speak to your elders.

508
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,080
That's a quick change of tone.

509
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,750
Not a problem. I'll see you.

510
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,460
Here you go, my boy.

511
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,670
Have a look
at your in-laws' place.

512
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,670
I'm here with a lot of hope,
the father of my beloved.

513
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,130
Don't make me leave alone.

514
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,420
Stop laughing.

515
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,790
You shouldn't hesitate to bow
before the place

516
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,040
that leads you to your destiny.

517
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,040
Wonderful.

518
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,130
Not the place, the direction.

519
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,460
It's the same.
Get into your character.

520
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,920
Okay, get into your UK
returned character. - Yeah.

521
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,040
Roop, do you see this house?

522
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:46,330
I like it. Its design is great.

523
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,880
Yeah, I like it too.

524
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,330
Looks like a copy
of a design from abroad.

525
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,460
No. I don't think this is
a copy. I think it's original.

526
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,420
Someone has personally
designed it.

527
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,330
Let's ask uncle.

528
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,040
Yeah, I don't mind.

529
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,710
Hello, uncle.

530
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,830
Hi, uncle.

531
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,500
Hello.

532
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,540
Can you help resolve our issue?

533
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,790
I think your nice
house's design is Indian.

534
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,420
I think it has been
copied from abroad.

535
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,580
It has been designed by me.
- Oh.

536
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,670
But it's inspired
by international style.

537
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,040
I love abroad architecture.

538
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,670
Wow. Wow.

539
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,000
My boy..

540
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,040
You look familiar.

541
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,920
This is my first time in India.
- Uncle.

542
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,540
We have just landed in India.
- Yes.

543
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,750
I was born in UK.

544
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,330
Can I click a pic of it?

545
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,460
Pic?

546
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,830
Photo? Picture? Snap?

547
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,750
You can click a picture
but you cannot copy the design.

548
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,540
It is my personal design.

549
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,380
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

550
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,080
Why don't you get in the frame?

551
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,460
I'll click a picture of you too.
- Oh yeah.

552
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,330
Come inside.
Have some refreshments.

553
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,170
Come with me.
- Thanks.

554
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,540
Thank you so much, uncle.

555
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,580
First of all tell me
what will you have?

556
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:04,080
Tea, coffee,
buttermilk or juice?

557
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,540
Tea would suffice.

558
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,670
Suffice?

559
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,080
Roop loves Punjabi.

560
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,330
It's our mother tongue.
- Yeah.

561
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,420
What did you say,
where are you from?

562
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,580
We are from UK.
Born and brought up in UK.

563
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,040
Wonderful.

564
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,170
You are fortunate to have been
born and brought up there.

565
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,250
In India one is born
only to give attendance.

566
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,080
You seem to be fed up of India.

567
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,670
You know how it is abroad.

568
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,170
You will know how it is here.

569
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,750
You cannot compare the two.

570
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,710
That's heaven and this is hell.
- Oh yeah.

571
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,580
That's good,
but this too is nice.

572
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,920
No.

573
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,420
You'll know in a while.
You've just landed here.

574
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,040
Are you brothers?

575
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,080
No. We are friends.

576
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,830
But like brothers, you know.

577
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,130
We've been in a lot together.
We are spoilt.

578
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,330
By spoilt I mean, he says he
wants to get married in India.

579
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,790
Otherwise he won't get married.

580
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,420
I say.
- My better half. Jeet.

581
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,580
Hi.
- Hello.

582
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,580
God bless you.
- Hi.

583
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,330
God bless you.
Please have a seat.

584
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,040
They are from UK.

585
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,170
Okay.
- I met them outside.

586
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,290
He wants to get married here.

587
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,170
Here? At our place?

588
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,880
In India. Here.

589
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,290
Okay.

590
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,960
It is my mom's wish that
I get married in Punjab.

591
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,330
This boy is very 'official'.

592
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
It's cultured.

593
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,830
It's the same, right?

594
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,540
Son, I am sure
we have met before.

595
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,580
How is that possible?
This is my first visit to India.

596
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,460
It's possible that
you must've seen me in UK.

597
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,330
Not in UK, I lived in Germany
for two and a half years.

598
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,210
In 1969.

599
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:48,670
I couldn't go back because
of some property issues.

600
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,290
Now I get it.
We must've met in Kelowna.

601
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,750
Isn't Kelowna in Canada?

602
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,580
It must be in Canada.
There's one in Germany as well.

603
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,290
I have sent people there.

604
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,880
I have a huge business
in London.

605
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,710
I keep sending my staff there.

606
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,790
Bye.

607
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,710
We'll get moving.
- No, son.

608
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,630
It was a pleasure meeting you.

609
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,040
You should at least
have tea before leaving.

610
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,420
Maybe some other time.
We'll see you again soon.

611
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,080
Okay. - Don't hesitate to ask
for a car to move around.

612
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,960
Yeah.
- No, we'll let you know.

613
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,290
Bye.
- Bye.

614
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,130
Yes, let's go.

615
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,000
Bye.
- Bye.

616
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,170
Goodbye.
- Okay.

617
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,670
Bye.
- Bye.

618
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,250
I like this boy.

619
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,080
What do you say?

620
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,790
You like anyone
who comes from abroad.

621
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,250
No, I think Disha
too will like him.

622
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,960
Fill it up for
the Punjabis, Shera.

623
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,580
You are pouring it miserly
as if this is scotch.

624
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,920
Hey, why are you
taunting us about scotch?

625
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,710
Two like you can fit
into a bottle of scotch.

626
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,920
DJ?

627
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,330
Yes?
- You are UK.

628
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:05,290
Deep first offers me scotch
and then gets inside the house.

629
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,380
Offers it to you?
Why? Are you a saint?

630
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,540
Why are you ruining this?

631
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,130
Moni..

632
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,630
Do you know Dilip Singh Dhillon?

633
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,750
The one from Germany?

634
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,210
Yes.
- Yes, I know him.

635
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,830
How is he?

636
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,830
He's fine. He's good.

637
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,880
He has a lot of
wealth and property.

638
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,790
He has just one daughter.

639
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,330
But he is stubborn
about one thing.

640
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,170
He wants his daughter
to marry someone from abroad.

641
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,170
Has he found someone?

642
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,080
I don't know.

643
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,830
He says he wants..

644
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,670
You guys are also from abroad.

645
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,170
You want me to talk
to him about you guys?

646
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,040
No, only about you.

647
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,670
And that too only
if I get scotch.

648
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,290
Hey, why do you worry
about the scotch?

649
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,750
Just talk about him.

650
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,040
We will drown you in scotch.

651
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,960
You will come out from
the scotch, gasping for breath.

652
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,880
People usually talk in
English after getting drunk.

653
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,380
They are the first ones
who talk in Punjabi.

654
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,040
Don't you worry.
Your job will be done.

655
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,460
Bottoms up!

656
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,130
As you wish.

657
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,040
Hey!

658
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,920
Well done, mix-breeder.

659
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,040
He too is celebrating.

660
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,920
Hello, papa! How are you?

661
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,880
All good, dear.
What about you?

662
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,830
I am missing you and mom.

663
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,960
Then come over in the morning.

664
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,880
I want to introduce you
to someone.

665
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,500
Did he find an NRI?

666
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,170
Who do you want me to meet?

667
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,170
Two boys have come from UK.

668
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,540
One of them is
a perfect match for you.

669
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,170
Oh God! You like all NRIs.

670
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,580
No, dear. I request you
to please meet him just once.

671
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,460
Okay. I'll be there.

672
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,880
Come over. Be here on time.

673
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,130
I'll be there.
I'm hanging up now.

674
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,170
Bye.

675
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,540
Jeet Kaur!

676
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,210
I won't say yes to dad.

677
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,670
I wish my dad too finds
an NRI for me.

678
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,750
I'll say yes for him
even without seeing him.

679
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,290
There are two.
Dad has chosen one for me.

680
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,290
I am so dead!
Fix me up with the other guy.

681
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,040
I'll say bye-bye to India.

682
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,880
Have you lost your mind, duffer?

683
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,080
You haven't even seen him
and you are ready to marry him.

684
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,920
What's there to see?
He must be 6 or 5 feet tall.

685
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,080
He might be handsome or not.
It makes no difference to me.

686
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,750
I just want to go abroad.
- Okay.

687
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,040
Your funda is very clear.
Come with me.

688
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,040
I don't know about my future
but let me set yours. Okay?

689
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,750
I say you too should
give your consent.

690
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,080
We will leave together.

691
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,130
I'll keep you company.

692
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,290
Kindhar Kaur, I'll put in
a good word for you right away.

693
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,580
Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon. Hi.

694
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,040
Hello, dear.

695
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,580
What are you doing, sunbathing?

696
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,670
You should try the coziness
of a library as well sometimes.

697
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,250
We were just leaving, dad.

698
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,960
Sir, Kindhar wanted..

699
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,880
Anyway, forget it.

700
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,040
Why do you hesitate?
Tell me what it is.

701
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,250
Nothing, dad.

702
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,420
She was just enquiring whether
if someone finds me an NRI boy

703
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,130
then will you give
your consent?

704
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,290
Naughty.

705
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,830
My daughter is very naughty.

706
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
It makes no difference to me

707
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,830
whether he is staying here
or abroad.

708
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,920
But you will have to find him,
I don't have time.

709
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,960
Yes!

710
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,170
Oh, Kindhar, I wish my dad
was just like yours.

711
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,540
Then he would've been
teaching history.

712
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,540
Listen, whether or not you like
the boy, I'm going to say yes.

713
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,040
Okay, if it pleases you,
I'll take you to my village.

714
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,630
Rest depends on your fate.
- So nice of you.

715
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,040
Now watch my aim.

716
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,750
See how I'll reel in
that boy from UK.

717
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,630
Wow! Great command over Punjabi!
Reel in!

718
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,250
What do you think?
Will Disha agree?

719
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,130
What can I say? This is
the first time they are meeting.

720
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,920
You look familiar.

721
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,500
Me?
- Yes.

722
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,920
This is my first visit to India.
- Okay.

723
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,830
Maybe you've pictured me.

724
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,420
Perhaps in your dreams.
- Oh. Very funny.

725
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,460
Where are you from?
- From Gilla.

726
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,830
Gilla?

727
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,880
Gilford street, London.

728
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,750
People in my circle
call it Gilla street.

729
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,130
You mean you stay in London.
- Yeah.

730
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,250
Kindhar likes your turban.
- Is it?

731
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,630
By the way who is Kindhar?

732
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,290
I am. Right before you.

733
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,670
Oh! Is that you?

734
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:56,290
Your name is Kindhar?
I like it. It's a nice name.

735
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,880
If you don't mind,
can I address you as Kindi?

736
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,080
Whatever you call me,
it makes no difference.

737
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,790
But don't stop talking.
- Oh.

738
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,330
What's your name?
- DJ.

739
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,040
Not your profession. Your name.

740
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,880
My name is DJ.

741
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,000
Daljeet, in short, DJ.

742
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,460
Nice name.
- Thank you.

743
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,880
People abroad go by such names.

744
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,290
DJ, AJ, SJ.

745
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,170
People change their names
to anything they like.

746
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,670
It's a nice name.

747
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,670
I just have a nice name.

748
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,540
Kindhar is nice in every way.

749
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,920
Thank you.

750
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,040
I want to see Punjab.

751
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,330
You don't need to ask.

752
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,580
What you see around you
is Punjab.

753
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,830
Like that is agriculture
and that is a house.

754
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,540
I want to see
Punjab's pure culture.

755
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,540
Oh. Okay.

756
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,290
You mean, the wells, the carts..
- Yeah.

757
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,210
The old Punjab, right?

758
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,130
Well, you've
copy-pasted me well.

759
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,210
But I still want
to see that Punjab.

760
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,420
Old is gold.

761
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,540
You are a tad late.

762
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,670
I mean you should've
come 40-50 years ago.

763
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,250
Punjab has modernized.

764
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,960
Hi-tech, you know.

765
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,170
I too keep myself up-to-date.

766
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,540
Can I ask you something?

767
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,920
Very personal. Don't mind.
- Yeah. Sure.

768
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,170
How many girlfriends
do you have?

769
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,330
Now..

770
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,080
I have many. I am casual with
many girls in the neighborhood.

771
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,460
But I don't have
a permanent one.

772
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,830
Then make Kindhar
your permanent girlfriend.

773
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,250
You sure?

774
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,540
Oh, my God.

775
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,580
What happened?
- You have very rough hands.

776
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,040
I work. One needs to work hard.

777
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,920
Moving the steering
has made my hands rough.

778
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,750
My hands might be rough
but my heart is soft.

779
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,170
Just like sponge.

780
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,750
I'll act like water and
let the sponge soak me up.

781
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,630
Don't say that
or I'll jump off the building.

782
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,130
You will jump and
I'll be the one who will die.

783
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,580
Can I come to your college?

784
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,580
As a guest?

785
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,880
College?
- Yeah.

786
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,170
You can surely
come to my college.

787
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,080
But I have a request to make.
Please don't refuse.

788
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,710
Don't insult me
by making a request.

789
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,170
Order me.

790
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,580
I want to surprise
my friends.

791
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,670
Come in a bullock-cart
when you come to see me.

792
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,420
A bullock-cart.

793
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,170
A bullock-cart.
On a bullock-cart.

794
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,750
You are going to refuse, right?
- No.

795
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,920
I.. I like..

796
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,040
I love bullock-carts.

797
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,330
Really?
- Yeah.

798
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,580
I love bullock-carts. Yeah.

799
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,170
Great.
- A bullock-cart.

800
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,920
Foreigner, you'll come
only when you find one.

801
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,750
Why did you have to agree to it?

802
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,130
She is messing around with me.

803
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,750
Let me think of something.

804
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,540
We'll be humiliated if we go
to college on a bullock-cart?

805
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,960
I wonder why she
fancies bullock-carts.

806
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,790
She is testing me.

807
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,250
And I don't wish to fail.

808
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,250
My job is done.

809
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,040
If you are not pleased, you
can leave and go do your job.

810
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,330
Oh really? How can
I leave you in the middle?

811
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,000
I am your true friend.

812
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,920
I know what friendship
you are talking about.

813
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,460
Then why are you
asking me to leave?

814
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,080
Try to understand, brother.

815
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,290
You too have lost it, brother.

816
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,880
Kindhar has cast
such a spell on me

817
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,420
that I've lost my heart.

818
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,290
Who's done that?

819
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,460
How does that concern you?

820
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,460
Come, have a seat, Moni.

821
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,630
We are practicing
to talk like you.

822
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,670
We have come to Punjab so
we should learn something new.

823
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,920
Right?
- That's nice.

824
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,290
He is acting stupid.

825
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,170
He wants to go to the city
in a bullock-cart.

826
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,880
He says bullock-carts aren't
easily available these days.

827
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,170
He says Moni will
arrange for one.

828
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:32,080
He says it's very difficult
to ask that from Moni.

829
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:32,960
Oh really?

830
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,540
How many do you want?
- One.

831
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,830
When?
- In the morning.

832
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,580
You'll get one
with horns and decorations.

833
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,920
Now tell me.
- Hey, now our job is done.

834
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,670
The job is not done as yet.

835
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,880
My scotch?

836
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,880
Don't worry about it. I'll
give you a sack full of them.

837
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,080
You can even bathe with it.

838
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,040
Then your job is done.
God's given us carrots..

839
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,500
Let's make a carrot cake.

840
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,040
You know this one as well?

841
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,960
Everyone's mother tongue
is the same, after all.

842
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,380
You can laugh later.
First call for a bullock-cart.

843
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,290
Okay.
- Make the call.

844
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,540
Okay.

845
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,290
Disha, I say if you don't decide
about marriage now

846
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,460
then when will you?

847
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,460
Why have you turned marriage
into a PhD degree, Kindhar?

848
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,750
You can call me Kindi.
- What?

849
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,460
The UK guy has given me
a pet name.

850
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,630
Oh my.

851
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,130
You've raced ahead in
the first meeting itself.

852
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,330
You are impossible, Kindhar.

853
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,540
Especially if I have
a friend like you.

854
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,540
Why did you have to keep the
condition of the bullock-cart?

855
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,880
They won't get a bullock-cart
and they won't come.

856
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,170
That's what I want.

857
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,710
They shouldn't get one
and they shouldn't come.

858
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,790
And we'll lose such good guys.

859
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,960
Let it be.

860
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,960
Wow! Great.
We would have lost them.

861
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,380
What happened?
- Look over there.

862
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,170
Oh God!

863
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:58,880
They are very stubborn.

864
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,920
Not stubborn, committed.

865
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,670
The boys from UK are committed.
- Shut up.

866
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,960
Stop!

867
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,170
What's this?
- A helicopter.

868
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,960
Can't you see the bullock-cart?

869
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,580
I know.
But how did you get it in?

870
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:14,830
We rode it.
We didn't push it. Hear that.

871
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,750
I won't let you take it further.
Park it in the parking.

872
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,170
How can you park
a bullock-cart in the parking?

873
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,330
Brother!
Don't you worry.

874
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,330
Nothing will go wrong.

875
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,750
They are professor
Chawla's guests.

876
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,790
That's fine,
but who will pick up their dung?

877
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,920
Want us to put diapers on them?
- Yeah.

878
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,580
Does their dung harm you?

879
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,040
In India I've seen walls filled
with dung cakes, like plasters.

880
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,670
Hey.

881
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,920
Hello.
- Hi.

882
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,830
Can we come down, Disha?
It would be nice.

883
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,540
Yes, yes. Of course.

884
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,130
Please.
- Let's go.

885
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,460
Hello.

886
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,210
Is the bullock-cart okay?
With two bullocks.

887
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,750
Or did you want the one
with one bullock?

888
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,580
Well, it's not required.

889
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:04,040
I am totally impressed
with this bullock-cart stunt.

890
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,420
Where did you get it from?

891
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,580
We got it with great difficulty.

892
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,580
We first requested the owner.

893
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,210
Then we begged to the bullocks.

894
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:12,830
And then we could take it.

895
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,580
But as it is said
no test is big or small in love.

896
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:20,330
For you I can get anything,
this bullock-cart is nothing.

897
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,750
I was just joking.
You took it to heart.

898
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,880
You are right.
I took it to heart.

899
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,170
Something that touches
the heart, touches the soul.

900
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,040
Oh my! You've memorized
a lot of dialogues.

901
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,460
Tell me, are you taking
any classes on romancing?

902
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,130
No, no, no.

903
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,580
Love always teaches something.

904
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,040
And one needs
to learn on his own.

905
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,460
Oh. Get it.

906
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,830
What's happening?
Who brought this bullock-cart?

907
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,420
Dad! They are from UK.
They are our guests.

908
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,830
Oh.

909
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,290
There are two of them, dear.

910
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,750
Which one is yours?

911
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,130
The one in the turban.

912
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,670
He's handsome.

913
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,920
DJ, my daddy.

914
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,540
Hi, dad. How are you?
I seek your blessings.

915
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,040
Hello.

916
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,750
Why did you come on
the bullock-cart, son?

917
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,080
We were fed up of the steering
and gears of expensive cars.

918
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,670
Just for change, you know.

919
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,170
We are trying to link
the heritage of Punjab.

920
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,130
Very good.

921
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,040
Besides, petrol is expensive.
- Yeah.

922
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:24,420
You kids talk. I'll make a move.

923
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,830
By the way, he's handsome.

924
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,170
Bye, uncle.

925
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,080
He was talking about me?
- Yes.

926
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,750
Tell me, what will you drink?

927
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,460
Tea, coffee or something else?

928
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,830
You tell me.
Do you want a ride?

929
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,040
Ride?
- I've brought a bullock-cart.

930
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:42,830
Okay.

931
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,460
There's a condition
if you want to give me a ride.

932
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,250
No more conditions.

933
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:49,920
More conditions.

934
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,750
Love doesn't strive
on conditions. Tell me.

935
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:57,880
You were saying something?
About the condition?

936
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,130
Oh right.

937
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,170
Do one thing.

938
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,960
Get a rickshaw tomorrow.

939
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,710
Rickshaw?
- Yes, a rickshaw.

940
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,040
A three-tire one.

941
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:12,040
Three tires. You know,
black and yellow. A local cab.

942
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,460
Oh.

943
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,040
We'll take a ride
in it tomorrow. - Oh yeah.

944
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,330
Okay?
- Done.

945
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,290
DJ..

946
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,380
DJ, let's go.

947
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,460
Sorry. I'll have to leave.
- Yes.

948
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,960
See you.
- See you.

949
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,330
Okay.
- Bye.

950
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,330
See you in a rickshaw.
- Yeah.

951
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,830
Okay. See you.

952
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,250
Let's go, sir.

953
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,330
Work fast or things
will go too far.

954
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,790
Tomorrow she will ask you
to come in a train.

955
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,630
How will we lay the tracks?

956
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,420
Now even if she asks
for a beach in the village

957
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,580
I'll get it.

958
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:47,830
Bye.

959
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,250
Yeah. I love you too. Yeah.

960
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:54,080
'The fortunate ones enjoy
themselves'

961
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:57,420
'on locally brewed liquor.'

962
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,960
You are cutting
a lot of vegetables.

963
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,040
Not a lot.
Just one. I am making greens.

964
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:07,210
Don't bother. Keep it simple.

965
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,040
What can get simpler? Grass?

966
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,880
You are in your house.

967
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,330
You are wearing green
and making greens.

968
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,830
How are you?
Hello.

969
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,540
Can't you say it in Punjabi?

970
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:21,290
If that is what you like
then okay. Hello, uncle.

971
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,670
Okay. She is sister Mitho
and I am your uncle.

972
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,880
This is how it is.
- Stop it.

973
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,040
Your hubby is jealous.
Hit me now.

974
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,960
Here's your scotch, Moni.

975
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,250
He's floored.

976
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,670
Are you happy now?
Enjoy. Hi.

977
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,040
Say hello. Shake hands.

978
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,920
You shouldn't mind.
- Oh really?

979
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,580
And why are you
cutting this grass?

980
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,330
Cook chicken.
My brothers are here.

981
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,750
I'll go and get the glasses.

982
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:50,000
Even if he doesn't get glasses
he will drink it from his palms.

983
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,170
Oh my.

984
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,170
He even knows about palms!

985
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,790
These boys are intelligent.

986
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,290
Shera!

987
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,960
We'll find a nice woman
in Toronto

988
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:09,630
and have Shera
settle down in Canada.

989
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,290
First let's get
ourselves settled.

990
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,420
You still haven't?

991
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,250
Listen up, everyone.

992
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,670
My Mrs. Roopinder Garewal
has made a request.

993
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,080
She wants to ride a rickshaw.

994
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,920
Wonderful!

995
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,040
You should first listen.

996
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,830
Is he reciting a poem
that you are praising him?

997
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,170
Listen to him.
- Yes.

998
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,330
Order me.

999
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,420
Ms. Disha needs a rickshaw.

1000
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,420
Why do we need
to ask him for it?

1001
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,170
We'll go and find one
in the morning.

1002
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,960
Who knows what will
happen in the morning?

1003
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,670
Let's call for one right away.

1004
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,040
Shera, go and get a donkey.

1005
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,290
Hey.

1006
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,830
Not that.
A three-wheeler rickshaw.

1007
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,460
The one in black
and yellow color.

1008
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,790
The one people ride in.

1009
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,420
Okay. The one who takes
people back and fro.

1010
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,920
It carries 70 people and the
driver still asks more to sit.

1011
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,830
Yes, that one.

1012
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,040
Okay. You want that rickshaw!

1013
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,790
I'll call for one right away.

1014
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,460
Amazing.
- Right?

1015
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,670
Long live Moni!

1016
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,460
Long live Moni!

1017
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,380
Hello.. Hello!

1018
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,380
He's saying long live Moni!

1019
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:33,040
Rama, my god-like brothers
have come down from London.

1020
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,040
Who has come from London?

1021
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,460
There must be someone.
How does it concern us?

1022
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,580
Yes, how does it concern
who is it.

1023
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:41,960
They want a rickshaw
first thing in the morning.

1024
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,420
Be here on time.

1025
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,290
You can charge
whatever you want.

1026
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,960
Be there.
Love you, Rama.

1027
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,670
Okay, DJ. Your job is done.

1028
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,460
Did you do me a favor?

1029
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,040
Who will do our work
if not you?

1030
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:57,750
Why? Am I your assistant?

1031
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,170
Then are you
Tony Blair's assistant?

1032
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,790
Hey, you said hey
to Mohan Singh?

1033
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,880
Look at him acting smart.

1034
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,420
Come to Jirakpur,
I'll break your legs.

1035
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,670
There's Jirakpur
in London as well?

1036
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,330
Friends!

1037
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,130
Our job is done.

1038
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:20,250
We have arranged
for a rickshaw.

1039
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,170
So, long live Moni!

1040
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,170
Long live Moni!

1041
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,290
Long live Moni!

1042
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:32,290
Mitho! Wake up and see,
they are praising me.

1043
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,540
Long live Moni!

1044
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:39,630
I think they are drunk.
I'll have to finish this scotch.

1045
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,330
Why have you come here
so early in the morning?

1046
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,210
Moni called for a tempo.

1047
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,580
Why does he need a tempo?

1048
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,790
Moni!
- Long live!

1049
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,420
Moni!
- Long live!

1050
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,750
Why have you called
for a rickshaw?

1051
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,080
Why do I need a rickshaw?

1052
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,460
I have my own car.
Ask him to leave.

1053
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,630
Fine.

1054
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,830
He's making
the whole house stink.

1055
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,210
Rama, we haven't called
for a tempo.

1056
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:19,580
You must've been mistaken.

1057
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,250
Go and do your work.

1058
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,790
I had just two drinks.

1059
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,710
So brother,
is the rickshaw ready?

1060
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:28,880
Which rickshaw?

1061
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,540
You spoke to a guy
on the phone last night.

1062
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,670
We need to take it
to the college.

1063
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,250
I forgot. I sent him away.

1064
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,210
Crap! Now?
- Now it's difficult.

1065
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,540
What you did was not right.

1066
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,290
You want to give him
more scotch?

1067
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,580
You have cheated us.

1068
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,080
Why do you drink
if you cannot take it?

1069
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,080
What an idiot!

1070
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:47,040
Don't use a lot of rustic words.
We made a mistake.

1071
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,210
We gave you scotch.

1072
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,580
We made a mistake
by coming to you.

1073
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:50,460
We asked you
to get a rickshaw.

1074
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,460
We should've gone
somewhere else.

1075
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,750
You promised us
a rickshaw last night.

1076
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,710
Why are you after my life?

1077
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:57,170
Hold this. Brush your teeth,
I'll go and get a rickshaw.

1078
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,250
Darn you! Look how he speaks!

1079
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,710
What do you think,
will he get it?

1080
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:02,750
Don't worry.

1081
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:06,670
The way we treated him, he'll
get us a rickshaw for sure.

1082
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,460
I've seen, India has
progressed a lot as well.

1083
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,250
Look, it's so beautiful.

1084
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,420
'Where has this
love brought us!'

1085
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,830
'My heart sings!'

1086
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,420
You guys are awesome.

1087
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,830
If you are getting bored

1088
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,040
next time I'll have an LCD
installed in the rickshaw.

1089
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,330
No, actually I was wondering..

1090
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:43,290
Like lovers don't last for long,
they won't come back. Right?

1091
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,750
I was wondering, we could settle
down in Chandigarh as well.

1092
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,960
No! Don't say that.

1093
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,290
I was thinking of making
a bungalow in Chandigarh

1094
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,710
and live here after marriage.

1095
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,460
I don't even like
the name of Chandigarh.

1096
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,830
Is that all?

1097
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,080
I'll change Chandigarh's name.

1098
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,500
I'll name it after you.
Kindigarh.

1099
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:03,880
So what's your next
condition, Disha?

1100
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,420
Don't hesitate.

1101
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,750
Now it's like, whatever
you say will come true.

1102
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,500
Oh really?
- Yes.

1103
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,670
Then come tomorrow.
- I will.

1104
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:17,670
Alone.
- What?

1105
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,460
Alone.
- Alone?

1106
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,330
Why? Are you shy
to come alone?

1107
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,580
I was not born to be shy.

1108
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,960
Tell me,
which ride do you want?

1109
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,670
Whichever you like.

1110
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,000
Watch it.
You'll have to sit with me.

1111
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,750
I will. I am sitting
with you now as well, right?

1112
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,750
She's trapped.
- What did you say?

1113
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,670
I was thinking about
tomorrow morning.

1114
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,460
'I came ringing the bells.'

1115
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,880
'Come and ride
with me on my cycle.'

1116
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,420
'I came ringing the bells.'

1117
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,290
'Come and ride
with me on my cycle.'

1118
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,750
Hello.

1119
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,790
What are you waiting for?
Have a seat.

1120
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,460
Where?

1121
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,920
Here. Where else can you?

1122
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,750
Where's the carrier?

1123
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:18,420
You are not meant to
sit on the carrier with me.

1124
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:21,830
What if I refuse?

1125
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,920
You will have to sit.
I brought the bullock-cart.

1126
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,630
I brought the rickshaw.

1127
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,420
Now you cannot refuse
when it's your turn.

1128
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:35,170
It's not so. I'll sit.
After all I promised you.

1129
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,250
Tell me, Disha.

1130
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,250
Which direction should
we take for our long drive?

1131
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,250
I'm seated.
Take me wherever you want.

1132
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,920
'It's you..'

1133
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,170
Thanks.
- To whom?

1134
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,330
To the one who made the cycle.

1135
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,920
'It's you..'

1136
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,330
'It's you..'

1137
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:05,210
'It's you, I desire.'

1138
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:06,790
'It's you..'

1139
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,210
'It's you..'

1140
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:11,080
'It's you, I desire.'

1141
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,580
'It's you..'

1142
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,040
'It's you..'

1143
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,920
'It's you, I desire.'

1144
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,460
'It's you..'

1145
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,880
'It's you..'

1146
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,960
'It's you, I desire.'

1147
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,170
Boys take girls to cafes.

1148
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,420
And you have brought me
to a field.

1149
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:58,790
What can I do?

1150
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,040
My soul lies in the fields.

1151
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:05,130
Strange. You love the fields so
much even after staying abroad.

1152
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,500
We love fields.
- Love?

1153
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,880
You are well-versed with our
lingo despite staying abroad.

1154
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,000
So what if I don't stay
in Punjab.

1155
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,500
I'm Punjabi at heart.

1156
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,330
Thank God you don't stay here.

1157
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,460
Otherwise,
the boys here are so spoilt

1158
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,880
they can have their
honeymoon near the tube well.

1159
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,500
Please don't mind,
but I liked the idea.

1160
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,670
Now I'd like to have my
honeymoon near the tube well.

1161
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:38,790
Then find a tube well in UK.

1162
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,080
And take the one
you marry there.

1163
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:43,920
The one I marry?
Why don't you give your consent?

1164
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,830
For what?

1165
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,670
Honeymoon near the tube-well,
marriage..

1166
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,920
You are so stubborn.
You are being so direct.

1167
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,170
I don't know
how to beat around the bush.

1168
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,000
I say what is in my heart.

1169
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:00,040
I've said it. Now you tell me.

1170
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,880
I'll think about it.

1171
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:08,380
Fine. She will at least
think about it.

1172
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:24,250
'The way you steal
glances at me.'

1173
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,750
'And the shy smile
on your lips.'

1174
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:33,670
'These things indicate
that you are in love.'

1175
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:37,880
'You don't agree
but I am sure.'

1176
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,210
'I tried reasoning
with my heart.'

1177
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:42,460
'It couldn't
understand a thing.'

1178
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:47,130
'I wait for you
to express your love.'

1179
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:53,000
'The way you steal
glances at me.'

1180
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:57,250
'And the shy smile
on your lips.'

1181
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,830
'The way you steal
glances at me.'

1182
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:06,040
'And the shy smile
on your lips.'

1183
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,880
'You feel linked to me.'

1184
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,830
'You feel linked to me.'

1185
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,290
'You turn towards me.'

1186
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,420
'You turn towards me.'

1187
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,540
'You feel linked to me.'

1188
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,830
'You turn towards me.'

1189
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,170
'You have been engulfed
by my love.'

1190
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:48,460
'Whether I like it or not,
my paths lead to you.'

1191
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:53,170
'While trying to refuse,
I expressed my love.'

1192
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:59,000
'The way you steal
glances at me.'

1193
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:03,540
'And the shy smile
on your lips.'

1194
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,790
'The way you steal
glances at me.'

1195
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:12,130
'And the shy smile
on your lips.'

1196
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,580
'I just wanna be with you.'

1197
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:16,830
'You make all my
dreams come true.'

1198
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,130
'All I think about is you.'

1199
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,670
'The way your hair soars
with the winds.'

1200
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:30,000
'And the way your stole
caresses the flowers.'

1201
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:34,960
'The way your hair soars
with the winds.'

1202
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,670
'And the way your stole
caresses the flowers.'

1203
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:43,830
'It feels restless
with a sight of you.'

1204
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,830
'Now my heart belongs to you.'

1205
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,290
'Whether I like it or not,
my eyes follow you.'

1206
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:57,000
'From a distance
they express my love.'

1207
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,830
'The way you steal
glances at me.'

1208
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:07,250
'And the shy smile
on your lips.'

1209
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,500
'The way you steal
glances at me.'

1210
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:16,130
'And the shy smile
on your lips.'

1211
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,670
Super rich house.

1212
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,250
We'll get a lot
of money from here.

1213
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,630
We'll get a lot.

1214
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,330
You just keep control
over your English.

1215
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,170
Alright?
- Yo.

1216
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,790
Hello.
- Hi.

1217
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,960
Hello.
- Hi.

1218
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:12,920
Please have a seat.

1219
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,130
Please have a seat.

1220
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,330
We have come from Jalandhar.
From Canada.

1221
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,540
Got it.
You don't need to say.

1222
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,170
We come to know
through the winds.

1223
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:24,170
Then ask someone to
remove all the sign boards

1224
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,630
and fix windmills.

1225
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,330
His sense of humor is good.

1226
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,750
Funny boy.
He's my cousin. Mintu.

1227
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:32,580
Mintu.

1228
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:34,420
Yes, Mintu is my house name,
actually.

1229
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,460
Permanent name is
Mahinder Pal Singh. - Wonderful.

1230
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,830
Lots of happy with you.
In front of you.

1231
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,460
Good. Thank you.

1232
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,460
We have come to India
to get him married.

1233
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,130
Oh. Congratulations.
- Right.

1234
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:46,920
Welcome.

1235
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,670
Let's eat something first
then we'll talk.

1236
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:50,540
Please.

1237
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,170
You will sit. We are alright.

1238
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,040
We didn't say you are wrong.

1239
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:55,040
No, no, no.

1240
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:59,210
He means we are alright as in
we are fine. We aren't hungry.

1241
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:02,040
You should have
a good look at Mintu.

1242
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:05,170
Me, permanent Canadian
from lots of years.

1243
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,210
Wonderful.
- Thank you.

1244
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,790
You can interview myself.

1245
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,460
If you feel right then
introduce me to your girl.

1246
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,540
Very simple.

1247
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,330
Right. You are good.

1248
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,830
My girl is busy in college
so she couldn't make it.

1249
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,790
We'll fix another meeting soon.

1250
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,000
No problem.
We come again and again.

1251
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,790
But 30 days only in India.
- Oh, I see.

1252
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,290
Actually, we have proposals
from Banso and Sangru.

1253
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,460
But I want Mintu
to get married to your girl.

1254
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:32,290
I think she's so pretty.
I love her picture.

1255
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,210
That's why we want to pick her.

1256
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:36,250
Lovely is the beauty,
your girl is.

1257
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:37,830
Your house is very beautiful.

1258
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,040
Beautiful house.
We just came to see it.

1259
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:45,460
We want to make similar
houses in Canada, not in India.

1260
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:46,540
Thank you.

1261
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:49,880
Where is it?
- Do you have it?

1262
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,130
In your pocket.

1263
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,040
My phone's ringing.

1264
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,080
Hello?

1265
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:57,380
Yes, Mintu Canada speaking.

1266
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,710
Yes. Yes.

1267
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,250
I'll reach within an hour.

1268
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,420
Okay. Bye.

1269
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,290
Uncle has sent 50,000 dollars.

1270
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:08,170
The agent wants me
to 'correct' them right away.

1271
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,750
Oh.
- Collect.

1272
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:11,580
Correct.
- Then we will have to leave.

1273
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:13,080
I'm so sorry
but we'll have to go.

1274
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,080
I like it here,
I don't feel like going

1275
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:16,460
but who can go against destiny?

1276
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:18,080
How is that possible?

1277
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:21,250
You didn't drink
or eat anything.

1278
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:22,630
It's okay.

1279
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:25,000
If we are fortunate
then we'll eat a lot of sweets

1280
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,580
and have a lot of drinks.

1281
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:28,040
It's not a problem.

1282
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:31,080
But come what may, your house
is so 'corrupt', I like it.

1283
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:34,130
Correct. Anyway,
I think we should leave. - Yes.

1284
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:38,040
Let's go. Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

1285
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:39,380
Let's go.

1286
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,540
I didn't like this boy.

1287
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,580
And then we are talking
to Roop about this.

1288
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:46,290
They have been after me
since a long time.

1289
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,750
We won't refuse them
right away.

1290
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:48,920
We'll keep them on hold.

1291
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,630
Who knows when
we might need them!

1292
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:55,670
Their girl will be as
beautiful as their house is.

1293
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:57,830
You concentrate on the house.

1294
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,920
Otherwise you'll
have to face the music.

1295
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,540
You are taking me seriously.
You fool, I belong to you.

1296
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:04,670
Let's go.

1297
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,170
I mean, I'm saying this
to me on your behalf.

1298
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:09,920
'Come on, Mintu.
Drive the car.' Let's go.

1299
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,130
Better.
- Please.

1300
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:14,920
Have a seat.

1301
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:18,540
She must be beautiful.

1302
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:26,250
Jugaadi,
the game is now in our hand.

1303
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:28,880
The ground is set.

1304
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,000
I think at the first opportunity
I should tell Disha everything.

1305
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,670
What are you two
whispering about?

1306
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,080
Nothing special, brother.

1307
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:39,040
Roop was saying
that he is thirsty.

1308
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:43,380
Thirsty. Feisty.

1309
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:45,290
Rebellious.

1310
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,540
What? I didn't get you.

1311
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,000
Bye-bye. Daljeet Singh Jugaadi

1312
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,790
has the traffic
in Jirakpur reduced?

1313
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,670
How do we know that?

1314
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:04,040
Roopinder Singh Garewal,
son of Harjeet Singh Garewal.

1315
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:08,040
Village and post office
Gill Kala, Fatehgarh Sahib.

1316
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,460
Isn't that your address?

1317
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,500
Should I tell you
the pin-code as well?

1318
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,880
I think someone has
instigated him against us.

1319
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:16,830
Instigated? Am I that easy?

1320
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,670
I have searched your bags.

1321
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:24,500
Daljeet Singh Jugaadi, isn't
Bye-Bye India your company?

1322
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,460
I.. I told Roop.

1323
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,880
Not Roop.
Roopinder Singh Garewal.

1324
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:41,000
I had told Roopinder..
- Drop your accent.

1325
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,920
I had told Roopinder Singh

1326
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,710
that we should tell
everything to Moni.

1327
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:49,080
He said we should check whether
or not you are strong enough.

1328
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:50,880
We should first test him.

1329
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,460
Hats off to you. You have
found out the truth about us.

1330
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:56,880
Come to the point.

1331
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:00,670
Look, we are not here
to cheat anyone.

1332
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,750
Right?
I am in love.

1333
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:04,960
You know what happens
when one falls in love.

1334
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:09,330
Talking won't suffice.
Cut a deal with me.

1335
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:13,920
Ask Jugaadi to send me
and my wife to UK.

1336
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,880
That's all? It's very easy
to send you to UK.

1337
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,790
I can make you leave for UK
tomorrow itself.

1338
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,290
Keep it in mind. Don't forget.

1339
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:23,170
Have you forgot when
you were trying to impress me?

1340
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,830
You had started
a restaurant in my village.

1341
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,710
Hear that.
Sister-in-law is here.

1342
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:29,960
One should help others, right?
- Yes.

1343
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,420
Behave,
or I will set you straight.

1344
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,130
He is troubling these poor kids.

1345
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:36,250
God bless you.

1346
01:07:38,790 --> 01:07:40,630
Please agree, my lord.

1347
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,920
Let me have my beloved.

1348
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:44,420
Such respect!

1349
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,460
No one will make you a juggler,
he's calling you lord.

1350
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,250
What else do you desire?

1351
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:54,130
Look, the bell rang before
I could say something.

1352
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:56,880
Hello?

1353
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,580
No phone? No message?

1354
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:01,670
I thought I shouldn't
disturb you.

1355
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,960
What if I want to be disturbed?

1356
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,420
Fine.

1357
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,080
I'll change the Facebook
status today itself.

1358
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:12,670
Disha now belongs to Roopinder.

1359
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:15,580
No one should take the trouble
of trying to impress you.

1360
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:17,170
You shouldn't be
so over confident.

1361
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,960
I haven't given it in writing.

1362
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,420
Then give it in writing.

1363
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:22,330
Okay.

1364
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:25,460
Boy from UK,
come to me as fast as you can.

1365
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,580
I want to introduce you
to someone.

1366
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:27,710
Alright.

1367
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:29,790
Ask him to get
my beloved as well.

1368
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,290
Get your friend as well.

1369
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,960
He is ready
to get inside the car.

1370
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,460
End the call and
we shall start the car.

1371
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,080
Who do you want me to meet?

1372
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:41,500
What's the hurry?
I'll introduce you.

1373
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,540
Hi, Disha.
- Hi!

1374
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:46,920
Sorry I am late.

1375
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,460
It's okay.
She is my best friend, Jyoti.

1376
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:51,500
Jyoti, she is Kindhar.
- Hi.

1377
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:53,750
He's..
- DJ.

1378
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:55,170
From UK.
- Hello.

1379
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:56,670
And he's Roop.

1380
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:00,460
Roop. Hi.
- Hi. Hello.

1381
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,000
Come, sit.
- Yeah.

1382
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:06,540
Roop.

1383
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:09,750
Oh! Your name matches
your looks.

1384
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:11,420
I pass him.

1385
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:13,330
Without even giving a test?

1386
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:16,960
I scan with my eyes.
- Shut up, Jyoti.

1387
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,790
Don't mind her.
She's very talkative.

1388
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,420
No, no.
Never mind.

1389
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,920
Boys don't mind girls talking.

1390
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,880
Specially in UK, right?
- Yeah.

1391
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,330
Oh God. I forgot to tell you.

1392
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:28,710
Jyoti too is from UK.

1393
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:29,710
Oh yeah?!
- Oh yeah?!

1394
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:30,790
Yeah.

1395
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:33,670
Oh.

1396
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:37,170
Disha told me that
you stay in Southall.

1397
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:40,290
I stay at Ashley Road.
My house number is 28.

1398
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,540
And yours?

1399
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:46,460
What.. I am getting cramps.
I'll have to go.

1400
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:48,540
I'll hit you.

1401
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:49,960
You can't leave me alone.

1402
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:53,670
How will I handle this alone?

1403
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,960
I asked, where do you stay?

1404
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,830
We..
- Gilford, Glassi Junction.

1405
01:09:58,920 --> 01:09:59,920
Oh yeah.

1406
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:01,960
I didn't ask the drink time.

1407
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,380
I asked where your
permanent residence is.

1408
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,830
She is just asking.
She won't come to your house.

1409
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,880
Actually her husband
is of the suspicious kind.

1410
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,920
Oh.
- That's nice.

1411
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,420
We stay near
the Gurudwara.

1412
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,920
Yeah.
- That's fine.

1413
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,920
But do you stay
near Nanaksar Gurudwara

1414
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,540
or Singh Sabha Gurudwara?

1415
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,880
Singh Singh Sabha.
- Yeah.

1416
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,670
Singh Sabha.
- We go there daily.

1417
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,420
I too have been going
there daily, since four years.

1418
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,880
But we never met.
- I know.

1419
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:35,960
Strange.

1420
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,420
By chance
we mostly go at night.

1421
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,210
They must be at work
during the day.

1422
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:43,170
Yeah. There's lot of work.

1423
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,460
Anyway,
where do you go to eat out?

1424
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:49,330
We go to the Gurudwara
to eat at the community kitchen.

1425
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,420
We don't go to the
restaurant that often.

1426
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,880
We sometimes eat
at the community kitchen.

1427
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,460
A person's thinking is
more important than eating.

1428
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:57,920
As to how you think.

1429
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,880
No, no, no. No philosophy.

1430
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,880
You have to tell me.
I should know your taste. - Hey.

1431
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,040
Taste? - How can you test him
after you have cleared him?

1432
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:08,040
Yeah. Not fair!

1433
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,880
Tell her, please.
We will go there in the future.

1434
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:14,290
Strange.
Why aren't you answering?

1435
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:16,580
Okay Roop, tell me

1436
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:19,460
which is the place you
will first take my friend to.

1437
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:22,330
Oh, I'll take her
to the Statue of Liberty.

1438
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,250
What? That's in New York.

1439
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,290
We stay in London.

1440
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,330
We'll go to New York
for our honeymoon.

1441
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,750
Yeah.

1442
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:38,790
By the way, I work at the Tube.
- Tube?

1443
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,500
She is cracking jokes now.

1444
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,580
Who can work at the Tube?

1445
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:47,170
You can work at
the Tube factory.

1446
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,250
She says she works at the Tube.

1447
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,790
Yeah.

1448
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:56,000
Tube means Metro train.
- Oh yeah.

1449
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,540
You stay in London and
you don't know about the Tube.

1450
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:00,960
Of course.

1451
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:09,080
There's a river in London.
What's its name?

1452
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:12,750
Oh yeah.
- Hear that.

1453
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,460
There are many rivers
flowing through London.

1454
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,670
It's hard to keep track of them.

1455
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,830
There's just one river
in London.

1456
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,710
And it is called the Thames.

1457
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:24,500
Yeah. Obviously Thames.

1458
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,040
Thames. Forgot the name.

1459
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:31,880
There is a Punjabi Bikaneri
restaurant at Oxford street.

1460
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,080
I am sure you keep going there.

1461
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:34,750
Oh yeah.
- Very often.

1462
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,580
We have Indian
snacks there, right?

1463
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:39,540
They are so tasty. Spicy.
- We visit that place so often.

1464
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:42,460
There is no restaurant
with that name in England.

1465
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,880
Where do we eat those snacks?

1466
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,710
Has it shut down?

1467
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:48,040
It must have shut down.
- How..

1468
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,670
Now stop this drama.

1469
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:56,880
Sorry, Disha,
they have failed my test.

1470
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,170
What do you mean?
I didn't get you.

1471
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:03,130
They are frauds.
They have never been to UK.

1472
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,500
This..

1473
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:12,750
I too was wondering they
have more accent than I have.

1474
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:14,250
Roop..

1475
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:16,960
What is Jyoti talking about?

1476
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:22,040
Why don't you say something?
- What do I say..

1477
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:31,960
Jyoti is right, Disha.
I am from Gilla.

1478
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:34,040
Roopinder.

1479
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:35,250
What?

1480
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,460
Actually, the first time..

1481
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:41,880
Shut up.

1482
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,130
You don't need to say anything.

1483
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:47,330
You have cheated me.

1484
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:48,420
I love you, Disha.

1485
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,170
Don't you take my name.

1486
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:53,000
Boys have turned love
into a joke, these days.

1487
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:55,290
Don't you ever show me
your face again.

1488
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:58,670
Get lost!

1489
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:00,670
Disha..

1490
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,790
Sorry, guys.

1491
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:20,580
Where should I keep the bags?

1492
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:22,290
On my head.

1493
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:24,250
Why are you getting
irritated with him?

1494
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:26,420
We failed because
of our own mistake.

1495
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:33,080
You get a degree in love
only after failing a few times.

1496
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:34,580
This isn't just about failure.

1497
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,540
We were caught cheating.

1498
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:40,540
Even a penny is valued. So don't
consider yourself worthless.

1499
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:43,130
Mitho is right.
Don't lose hope.

1500
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,920
Bye, sister.
- Bye, brother.

1501
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,040
If you feel that we can be of
help to you, do let us know.

1502
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:51,960
I couldn't form a relationship
with her

1503
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,920
but I formed with you
one that will last a lifetime.

1504
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,460
Please forgive us if we
have made any mistake, sister.

1505
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:03,540
No, my brothers.
You are a gem of a person.

1506
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,330
Moni told me everything.

1507
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:09,540
Don't cry. We will feel bad.

1508
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,420
We won't like it here
without you.

1509
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:13,540
We will go and meet them
in the city.

1510
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:14,790
They live in India.
Get in, brother.

1511
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,960
Lovely..

1512
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:58,420
Did the Dhillons call?

1513
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,960
No. They didn't call.

1514
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,670
I'm going through a bad phase
since the past 6 months.

1515
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,330
For you it's only
since the past 6 months.

1516
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:11,210
My bad luck began
the day I got married to you.

1517
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:13,170
Aren't you tired of saying
the same thing everyday?

1518
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:14,290
What else do I say?

1519
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:16,330
Your parents lied
about your property

1520
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,830
and had me married
to an illiterate like you.

1521
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:22,040
And as a punishment for cheating
you I am cheating other people.

1522
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:24,130
Oh really?
Won't I recover my money

1523
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:26,880
which you splurged in casinos
in Canada from you?

1524
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,580
By calling your husband
your cousin?

1525
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:30,420
I think we are done.

1526
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:31,460
Get this straight.

1527
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:34,080
If it remains the same
then I'll go back to Canada.

1528
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:36,040
Go back to Canada, my foot!

1529
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,040
As if you have multiple
factories there.

1530
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:40,460
As if you have a mint
opened for me over here.

1531
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:43,580
I had. But I couldn't
get this family.

1532
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:47,130
I wonder how Bye-Bye India's
Daljeet could influence them.

1533
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,080
He is the thorn in our flesh.

1534
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:52,290
We need to get his details.
- We will.

1535
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,580
But by keeping a safe distance.

1536
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:56,130
A little mistake and
we go straight to prison.

1537
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,250
Please, gain command
over your English.

1538
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,880
Now do you wish
to stay as my cousin?

1539
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,380
Disha..

1540
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:32,000
She won't listen to you.

1541
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:33,920
Why?

1542
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:36,540
Ask her to talk to me
just once.

1543
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:38,580
Where is the one who ties a
small turban. - He'll come too.

1544
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:39,710
I'll bash him up if
he comes in front of me.

1545
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,420
Forget about him.
You ask her to talk to me.

1546
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,790
No. You were playing a game,
right? Now the game is over.

1547
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,250
Fine. I played a game.
I played it because of her.

1548
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:47,830
Disha!

1549
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:53,750
Tell her, I won't back off.

1550
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,250
I love her.

1551
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:19,500
You are a liar.

1552
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:22,540
Why did you lie to me?

1553
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,290
I loved you.

1554
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,000
I will never forgive you.

1555
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:36,170
Never.

1556
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:44,750
'Being separated from you,
my heart aches.'

1557
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:48,670
'It shows in my eyes.'

1558
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:56,880
'As tears they started pouring.'

1559
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:04,080
'All my dreams have shattered.'

1560
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:10,790
'Even God isn't
favoring me anymore.'

1561
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:18,170
'Why didn't our hearts beat
as one?'

1562
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:26,380
'They were yet to give consent
but they parted ways.'

1563
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:33,960
'Being separated from you,
my heart aches.'

1564
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:38,130
'It shows in my eyes.'

1565
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,290
'As tears they started pouring.'

1566
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:10,170
'I go down memory lane
and I miss you.'

1567
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:19,830
'I fear I'll have to live
being separated from you.'

1568
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:27,250
'This troubles me, I cannot
endure it, my beloved.'

1569
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:30,460
'I regret giving away my heart.'

1570
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:35,830
'I cannot even breathe,
my beloved.'

1571
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:43,830
'Being separated from you,
my heart aches.'

1572
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,830
'It shows in my eyes.'

1573
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:54,630
'As tears they started pouring.'

1574
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:03,670
'Being separated from you,
my heart aches.'

1575
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:08,040
'It shows in my eyes.'

1576
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:15,960
'As tears they started pouring.'

1577
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:24,830
What's wrong with Disha?
She is always in her room.

1578
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:28,580
I spoke to her, she says
she is worried about the exams.

1579
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:30,540
I am worried about her marriage.

1580
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,920
What will we do if Roop says
yes to someone else?

1581
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,040
I will speak to her.

1582
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:38,040
I suggest we should
get them engaged.

1583
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:40,880
Heed my advice,
don't pressurize the girl.

1584
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,920
Let her make the decision.
- You never listen to me.

1585
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,960
You always do as you please.
- Do as you please.

1586
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,580
'Don't pressurize her.'

1587
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,210
We have found such a nice boy.

1588
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:51,880
What if we lose him?

1589
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,130
One doesn't come across
such boys everyday.

1590
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:56,960
And he is an NRI.

1591
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,040
Why are you scanning this?
Scan your brain.

1592
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:04,330
Think of something.

1593
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,460
What should I scan for
in my brains?

1594
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:07,630
My mind is shut. It is locked.

1595
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,080
There's a curfew
on my heart and my mind.

1596
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:10,670
I cannot think of anything.

1597
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:13,540
Do one thing.

1598
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,880
Call Kindhar.
- Kindi.

1599
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,500
Whatever.

1600
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,880
Ask her to make me speak
to Disha once.

1601
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,960
I cannot call Kindi.

1602
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,880
She keeps insulting me. I cannot
endure so much humiliation.

1603
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:26,420
Call anyone you want.
- Here.

1604
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:34,290
Stupid.. Why?
Hello! Hello?

1605
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:39,130
Why do you keep calling me?
Shameless. Liar. Stupid.

1606
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,580
Take some.
She is distributing it for free.

1607
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:43,080
You think I am
giving you offerings?

1608
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:45,210
Don't you ever call me again!
I am dead for you.

1609
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:48,330
No, Kindhar. Sorry Kindi,
please don't say that.

1610
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,170
Will you hang up
or should I disconnect?

1611
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:51,080
Look..

1612
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:55,040
The thing is, please make
your friend meet Roop just once.

1613
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:56,880
He is sitting with me.
He is in a bad state.

1614
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,080
He will die.

1615
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:00,880
If I take his name,
Disha will kill me.

1616
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,880
Ask her where she is.
- Just tell me where she is.

1617
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,630
Why should I? Don't you
ever call me again, Mr. Jugaadi.

1618
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:11,290
Fraud. Okay?

1619
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,420
Here's your toy.

1620
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,540
Go and meet Kindi today itself.

1621
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:21,330
I feel that you
will convince her.

1622
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,460
Oh really?

1623
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,040
You think I wasn't insulted
enough over the phone

1624
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:25,920
now I should go there
and get insulted.

1625
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:30,380
A friend in need
is a friend indeed.

1626
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,420
Only Kindi can help me
meet Disha.

1627
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:36,710
Last time.

1628
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:40,170
After this if anyone will get
insulted, it'll be you, not me.

1629
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,170
Thank you, brother.

1630
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,040
Kindi look,
I am the same person.

1631
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:49,040
Only the UK tag was a lie.

1632
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:50,540
That is the problem.

1633
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:52,080
There is nothing
wrong with me, right?

1634
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:53,580
I am not a bad person, right?

1635
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:55,790
You are a nice person,
but you are from India.

1636
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,580
100 percent Indian.

1637
01:23:57,670 --> 01:24:00,130
But I want someone
who is 100 percent NRI.

1638
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,330
That is why I loved you.

1639
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:04,290
No matter how
you would've been

1640
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:06,960
but you should
have been from there.

1641
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,420
What do you mean?
- My funda is clear.

1642
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,540
I will love and marry only the
one who shall take me abroad.

1643
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:14,040
Is that the problem?

1644
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:15,580
Not the problem.
The only problem.

1645
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:17,880
Hey, that's not difficult.

1646
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,040
I send 150 people abroad
every year.

1647
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:23,380
We can settle abroad later.
That's not a problem.

1648
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,540
Are you lying?

1649
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:29,210
No. Look, my parents'
souls are watching me.

1650
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:30,960
Ask them whether
I have ever lied to them.

1651
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,750
I swear on God.
Have I ever lied? Never.

1652
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:37,130
Fine. I forgive you just once.

1653
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:40,000
But things will work out
only if you take me abroad.

1654
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:43,920
Want a cup of tea?

1655
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,830
I have never tried it
but I cannot refuse it today.

1656
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,250
I'll drink it.
- Let's go.

1657
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,040
Disha..

1658
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,500
I accept that I was wrong.

1659
01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:08,540
But whatever I did,
it was to be with you.

1660
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,630
Disha..

1661
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:18,000
Please listen to me.

1662
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:20,750
Please don't give me
such a big punishment.

1663
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:25,210
Please.

1664
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:26,330
Please!

1665
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,420
Disha!

1666
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,420
Disha, you are the first and
the last girl I am pleading to.

1667
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:33,290
Madam.
- Yes?

1668
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:35,920
Is it wrong to love?
- No. Who says so?

1669
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,040
Heard that?

1670
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:38,130
Disha..

1671
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,580
Brother, is it wrong
to lie to make someone yours?

1672
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,880
It's okay to lie a little.

1673
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:45,580
Madam.
- Yes?

1674
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:47,290
Should you forgive if someone
apologizes from the heart?

1675
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:49,960
I would.
- Heard that?

1676
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,040
Listen up, everyone.

1677
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,170
Brother, please. Hear my plea.

1678
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:56,290
Madam..

1679
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,420
I love this girl.

1680
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:02,420
I lied about a small thing.

1681
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,250
Not out of greed for something.

1682
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,040
Just to make her mine.

1683
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:08,000
That too because of her dad.

1684
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,670
And today

1685
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,250
I apologize to her
in front of all of you.

1686
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,130
Here you go.

1687
01:26:20,670 --> 01:26:21,830
Here you go.

1688
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,670
Please forgive me.
I am your culprit.

1689
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:31,920
Enough of this.
Will you stop this drama now?

1690
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:34,420
This is the limit.

1691
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,170
This concerns my life
and you are calling it a drama!

1692
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:39,380
What do you want?
- I want you.

1693
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,080
And I want to be
forgiven for my mistake.

1694
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:45,330
You are a liar.
You are a beguiler.

1695
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:47,670
You deceived me.
- I didn't have an option.

1696
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:49,880
You should have spoken
to my parents.

1697
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:50,920
You should've asked
my hand in marriage.

1698
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,040
I had.

1699
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:54,420
My dad phoned your dad.

1700
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,960
He said he wanted an NRI boy.

1701
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,290
You are lying.
- I swear.

1702
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,500
I swear on my mother.

1703
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:16,630
I will wait for you near
the pumping station, tomorrow.

1704
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,380
I was sure I won't
have to wait forever.

1705
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:06,920
I still don't believe you.

1706
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,540
If you didn't believe me
you wouldn't have come here.

1707
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:13,790
I am here just to
let you know my decision.

1708
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:17,670
Who are you and I to decide?

1709
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:20,250
God has decided for us.

1710
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,670
We shall be together forever.

1711
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:30,380
I am not going to follow you.

1712
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:35,880
Who is asking you to?
I'll follow you.

1713
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:38,170
You have your way with words.
You are a liar.

1714
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,670
You are a beguiler.

1715
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,960
You have made me cry a lot.

1716
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,170
You didn't cry alone,
I too cried with you.

1717
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,880
For once,
I thought I should die.

1718
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:54,920
What is the use of living now?

1719
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,580
You tell me what
I could have done?

1720
01:28:57,670 --> 01:29:00,000
Your father needed an NRI boy.

1721
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:02,130
What if something would
have happened to me?

1722
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,960
I wouldn't let you die alone.

1723
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:14,670
You made me cry a lot. Now
don't you ever leave me again!

1724
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:20,000
This goon spoilt a decent girl.

1725
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:22,790
You can say anything you want.

1726
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:27,630
Now you are my queen
and I am your servant.

1727
01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:34,710
Fill your name over here
and your address over here.

1728
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:35,830
Fine.
- Did you understand?

1729
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,670
Okay, ma'am.
- Excuse me, sir.

1730
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,210
Sir, a ma'am and a sir
have come to meet you.

1731
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:41,580
They are sitting in your office.

1732
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:43,210
A ma'am and a sir?
- Yes.

1733
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:46,540
This means Kindi
is here with her father.

1734
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:48,540
She is very intelligent.

1735
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:51,500
Get back to work.
- Okay, sir.

1736
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:09,580
Yes? How can I help you?

1737
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,710
Hi.
- Done. Tell me.

1738
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:15,130
I forgot to say hello.
Take my hello and lots of intro.

1739
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,080
I am called Mintu.

1740
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:23,580
Who says? Tell me. I shall talk
to them. That's not a problem.

1741
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:24,880
No, no, no.

1742
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,080
Me Mahinder Pal Singh.

1743
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:28,920
My grandma affectionately
calls me Mindu.

1744
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,790
Anyway, when I was wake,
my aunt said me, Mintu.

1745
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,580
The another this is..
- Excuse me.

1746
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:37,710
If he takes so long, don't
bother to tell me her name.

1747
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:40,290
No. I'll tell you my name.
It's Lovely.

1748
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,670
Lovely. Short and sweet.
- Hello.

1749
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:46,460
By the way, we are
into the same business.

1750
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,790
Ever since
you started this business

1751
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,080
we have suffered huge losses.

1752
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:52,710
The lots of difficulties
in on front of us, actually.

1753
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:54,750
I think he recently
flunked the IELTS exam.

1754
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:56,330
Was a ban issued on him?

1755
01:30:56,420 --> 01:31:00,460
Actually, he means we can
earn lots of money together.

1756
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:03,080
What do you think?
- 50-50, lots of profit.

1757
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:04,040
What do you mean?

1758
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:05,830
I mean we will send
a few people abroad

1759
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,420
and rest can go to hell.

1760
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,540
Simple.
- No!

1761
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,580
What did you think
before coming to my office?

1762
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:13,420
That we will convince you. Deal
will come through. Nothing else.

1763
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,710
Yes.
- I don't know about the deal

1764
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:18,460
but when I hit you with
my slippers lots of time

1765
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,920
you will feel very bad.

1766
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,460
I am restraining myself
because of Ms. Lovely.

1767
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,710
Otherwise I would've
turned you bald by now.

1768
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:27,040
Don't try to act smart, mister.
Use your brain.

1769
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,580
You stand to lose a lot.

1770
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:32,580
You shouldn't ever
lock your luck.

1771
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:35,080
You mean you won't
leave until I thrash you.

1772
01:31:35,170 --> 01:31:36,580
Cool, mister. Cool.

1773
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:38,580
It's okay if you
don't accept our deal.

1774
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:40,040
Come on, Mintu. Let's leave.

1775
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,420
What's the hurry?

1776
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,170
Do one thing. Order tea.

1777
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:44,710
People sometimes
change their mind.

1778
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:45,790
No problem.

1779
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:46,880
He has kept the bell way down.

1780
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,130
Let me get some tea for you.

1781
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,290
You love cricket, don't you?

1782
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:54,080
Come on,
let's go and get the ball.

1783
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:55,790
We will play some other day,
brother.

1784
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,290
Nice meeting you.

1785
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,080
You come sometime.

1786
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:03,170
Me permanent. Follow me.

1787
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:04,420
Let's go.

1788
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,960
Short and sweet.

1789
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,580
Hello, sir. What's up?

1790
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:18,460
What can be up? The sky
seems dull, you know that.

1791
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,580
Recharge the battery
of your heart.

1792
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:23,080
We are back on track.
Everything has been settled.

1793
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:25,790
What! Swear by God.

1794
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:28,540
Calm down. I will tell you
everything once we meet.

1795
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:31,330
There is an invitation for
Jyoti's marriage anniversary.

1796
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:34,580
Isn't Jyoti the one who
ruined everything for us?

1797
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:36,080
Yes, that's her.

1798
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:39,290
Today at her function
we will set everything right.

1799
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:42,880
Listen, dress well,
don't get us humiliated.

1800
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,540
Well done, my boy.
You have pleased me.

1801
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:03,210
'You are wearing a traditional
yellow dress with ornaments.'

1802
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:06,580
'For that I wish to
give you a salute, my girl.'

1803
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:08,540
'I salute you, my girl.'

1804
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:13,960
'You are wearing a traditional
yellow dress with ornaments.'

1805
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:17,460
'For that I wish to
give you a salute, my girl.'

1806
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:22,330
'I praise the lock of hair
on your forehead.'

1807
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:24,460
'The lock of hair.'

1808
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:27,540
'You are my first choice,
my girl.'

1809
01:33:27,630 --> 01:33:29,420
'My first choice.'

1810
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,580
'My first choice.'

1811
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:34,670
'You are my first choice,
my girl.'

1812
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:36,460
'My first choice.'

1813
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:39,040
'My first choice.'

1814
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:49,170
'I've been spoilt for choices
in my life.'

1815
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:52,710
'I am a beautiful damsel.'

1816
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:54,710
' A beautiful damsel.'

1817
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:56,290
' A beautiful damsel.'

1818
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:59,880
'I've been spoilt for choices
in my life.'

1819
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:03,420
'I am a beautiful damsel.'

1820
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:08,830
'I am like
a delicate glassware.'

1821
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:13,460
'The crazy youth dances
in a carefree manner.'

1822
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:15,290
'Dances in a carefree manner.'

1823
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:17,290
'Dances in a carefree manner.'

1824
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:20,420
'The crazy youth dances
in a carefree manner.'

1825
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,330
'Dances in a carefree manner.'

1826
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:24,540
'Dances in a carefree manner.'

1827
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:34,960
'Your blush has ruined me.'

1828
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,080
'Your shyness has killed me.'

1829
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:39,920
'Your shyness has..'

1830
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,080
'Your beautiful shyness has..'

1831
01:34:42,170 --> 01:34:44,040
'Your beautiful shyness has..'

1832
01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:47,580
'Your blush has ruined me.'

1833
01:34:47,670 --> 01:34:50,960
'Your shyness has killed me.'

1834
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,790
'Your beautiful shyness has..'

1835
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:57,880
'You are worth millions
when you move.'

1836
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,880
'You are my first choice,
my girl.'

1837
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,960
'My first choice.'

'My first choice.'

1842
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:24,670
'She is of the color
of the afternoon sky.'

1843
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:27,580
'She moves in style.'

1844
01:35:27,670 --> 01:35:29,420

'She moves in style.'

1849
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,080
'Moves in style.'

1850
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:47,540
'She is like a live wire
when she dances!'

1851
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:52,210
'The crazy youth dances

1852

'Dances in a carefree manner.'

1857
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:10,170
'From the time
you have come of age.'

1858
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:13,420
'Boys have stopped
guarding their fields.'

1859
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,460
'They have stopped
guarding their fields.'

1860
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:17,420
'They have stopped
guarding their fields.'

1861

'They have stopped
guarding their fields.'

1864
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:33,460
'You are the one
I like to see dancing!'

1865
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:35,080
'To see dancing.'

1866
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:38,170
'You are my first choice,
my girl.'

1867
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:40,330

'My first choice.'

1872
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,670
'Yes!'

1873
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:59,920
'I hang strings
from my earrings.'

1874
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,920
'I fill my fair arms
with beautiful bangles.'

1875
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,080
'My fair arms.'

1876
01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:06,880
'My fair arms.'

1877
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,460
'My fair arms.'

1878
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:12,290
'I hang strings
from my earrings.'

1879
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:15,580
'I fill my fair arms

'My fair arms.'

1881
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:22,670
'I look beautiful
like the dawn.'

1882
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:24,460
'Wherever I dance.'

1883
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:27,580
'The crazy youth dances
in a carefree manner.'

1884
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:29,420
'Dances in a carefree manner.'

1885
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,580
'Dances in a carefree manner.'

1886
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:34,540
'You are my first choice,
my girl.'

1887
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:36,330
'My first choice.'

1888
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:38,580
'My first choice.'

1889
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:41,710
'The crazy youth dances
in a carefree manner.'

1890
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,920
'Dances in a carefree manner.'

1891
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,960
'My first choice.'

1892
01:37:48,750 --> 01:37:50,830
Wow. Excellent.

1893
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:54,880
It was great. I felt like I am
dancing at my wedding.

1894
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,250
To tell you the truth,
I too felt the same.

1895
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:00,250
Then start the preparations.
What's the problem?

1896
01:38:00,670 --> 01:38:03,210
So, madam? Why do you wish
to wear the wedding dress?

1897
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:06,210
It's not that easy.
- Why? What's the problem now?

1898
01:38:06,290 --> 01:38:09,920
The high court is ready.
- But the supreme court isn't.

1899
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,250
Supreme court?
- My dad.

1900
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:15,170
Go and tell your
father everything.

1901
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:17,830
You want me to tell my dad
about you?

1902
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:18,830
Of course!

1903
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:21,750
I don't know about you,
but he will send me to Canada.

1904
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:24,040
Who is from Canada?
- There's someone.

1905
01:38:24,130 --> 01:38:25,710
Dad has kept him on hold.

1906
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:27,790
Your old man is very cunning.

1907
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:29,790
Excuse me. Manners.

1908
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:33,790
Okay. Sorry. Please go
and convince your father.

1909
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:35,380
Otherwise we won't be
able to take things forward.

1910
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:38,080
You should do something.
I am scared.

1911
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:39,040
I cannot do it.

1912
01:38:39,130 --> 01:38:41,290
How can we go
and tell your dad

1913
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,040
that we have committed
a fraud with him?

1914
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:45,040
It is not right for the boys
to go and meet him.

1915
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:47,580
And with your dad's anger,
he won't even need a stick.

1916
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:49,830
He will beat us
with his mustache.

1917
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:51,420
True.

1918
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:08,580
You read newspapers
all day long.

1919
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:10,880
Don't you want to spend time
with our daughter?

1920
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,290
She is here only for a day.

1921
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:14,790
Where is she?

1922
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:18,670
Why are you standing over there?

1923
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:19,790
Come over here.

1924
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:21,670
Come on.

1925
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:24,040
Have a seat.

1926
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:27,500
Silly girl.
I wanted to talk to you.

1927
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,580
Dad, I too wanted
to talk to you.

1928
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:31,580
I shall listen to you.

1929
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:33,580
But you first hear what's
written in the newspaper.

1930
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:35,250
Look what's going on
in this world.

1931
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,130
A foreigner groom turned out
to be an Indian.

1932
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:40,880
How is that possible?

1933
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:43,460
Someone got a girl
married in Roopnagar.

1934
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:45,170
They were told
the boy was from America.

1935
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,750
But he was from Mohali.
- Oh God.

1936
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:49,920
Such people should be arrested.

1937
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Arrested? I would've
shot such people dead.

1938
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:55,580
They have no shame left.

1939
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:59,420
They don't think before
ruining someone's life.

1940
01:39:59,830 --> 01:40:03,130
The girls' families too blindly
get their daughters married.

1941
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:09,540
Forget about it. Tell me,
what did you want to say?

1942
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:12,290
I..

1943
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,540
I was saying that..

1944
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:19,000
You shouldn't worry about me.

1945
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:22,250
You have made all
my worries go away, dear.

1946
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:24,880
Tell me when should
I call those guys from UK?

1947
01:40:26,170 --> 01:40:28,080
Whenever you feel right, dad.

1948
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:31,250
As you wish. What can I say?

1949
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:34,290
Dad..

1950
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,040
Will you have tea?

1951
01:40:37,130 --> 01:40:39,170
I'll send tea for you.

1952
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:40,540
I'll be right back.

1953
01:40:40,630 --> 01:40:43,670
Saw that?
My daughter is so smart.

1954
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:45,710
Learn something from her.

1955
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:47,670
You too should learn
something sometimes.

1956
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:50,330
You have spent all
your life teaching others.

1957
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:52,540
You will never say
the right thing.

1958
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,080
I left Germany because of you.

1959
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:57,540
But you will never stop nagging.

1960
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,040
One should never marry
a girl richer than oneself.

1961
01:41:02,130 --> 01:41:03,500
She never listens.

1962
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:11,670
I cannot tell the truth
to my dad.

1963
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,500
He will shoot both of you.

1964
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:17,040
Why both of us?
It's his mistake.

1965
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:19,080
I was unnecessarily
dragged into it.

1966
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:20,670
You are trying to shy
away from this?

1967
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:22,330
It was your idea, wasn't it?

1968
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:24,830
We should go as guys from UK.
Now lead us.

1969
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:28,330
Monkey gets the cream
and I get kicked.

1970
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:29,420
Who did you call a monkey?

1971
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,040
You shouldn't take
everything seriously.

1972
01:41:31,130 --> 01:41:32,960
It's a saying. You shouldn't
take everything personally.

1973
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,460
Listen, if you want
to talk nonsense

1974
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:37,330
then do so after I go to Canada.

1975
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:41,170
Your old man.. your dad.

1976
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,080
Anyway, tell me
what should we do now?

1977
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:46,290
It will be same as before.

1978
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:48,000
Stay as boys who
have come from UK.

1979
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:51,080
You come to my house
with your family

1980
01:41:51,170 --> 01:41:52,670
and ask for my hand in marriage.

1981
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:57,080
We will tell the truth
to my dad at the right time.

1982
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:58,880
I should bring my family?

1983
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,000
To your house?

1984
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:01,670
Hear that.

1985
01:42:02,130 --> 01:42:03,170
Yes..

1986
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:05,040
As people who are from UK.

1987
01:42:05,130 --> 01:42:05,920
That is not possible.

1988
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,040
It's impossible.
- Why is it impossible?

1989
01:42:08,130 --> 01:42:11,790
You don't know my dad.
He will beat me black and blue.

1990
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:13,330
Think of something else.

1991
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:17,420
Fine, I have
an option of Canada.

1992
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:20,170
He is not a bad person.

1993
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:21,420
You think of something
for yourself.

1994
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:24,670
My family will kill me.

1995
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:27,420
Jugaadi, you think of something.

1996
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:30,290
Great. You want me
to fix everything.

1997
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:31,330
You will never do anything
on your own.

1998
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:32,790
He thinks I am Google.

1999
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,170
He searches for
everything on me.

2000
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,420
Yeah, right.
Your system has already hanged.

2001
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:42,880
Look, love is
all about the heart.

2002
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:43,960
You cannot resolve
the issues by talking.

2003
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:45,670
You need to put
your heart into it.

2004
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:47,580
Look how strong
this girl is acting.

2005
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:49,290
Why are you so scared?

2006
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:52,080
Hey, I am not scared of anyone.

2007
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:54,420
I am just a little nervous.

2008
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,880
If you are not scared
then do as she says.

2009
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,790
Go for it. Make the declaration.

2010
01:42:58,880 --> 01:42:59,830
She can also tell her family..

2011
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,330
Else, you should
forget about me.

2012
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:02,500
You..

2013
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:17,670
Brother!

2014
01:43:19,790 --> 01:43:21,880
Brother, come and eat breakfast.

2015
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,830
Do you want it in writing?
I don't want to eat.

2016
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,670
I said it once. No means no.

2017
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:27,170
Why are you venting
your anger on food?

2018
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:28,330
Don't be stubborn. Come on.

2019
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:29,170
You didn't eat anything
last night as well.

2020
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:31,040
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't trouble me.

2021
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:33,040
Go and do your work.
Go away from here.

2022
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:43,960
What happened?
Why do you look so sad?

2023
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,040
I had gone to ask
brother for lunch, aunt.

2024
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:48,330
He said he doesn't want to eat.
He scolded me as well.

2025
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:49,830
Why? Why doesn't he want to eat?

2026
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,170
I don't know. He didn't eat
anything last night as well.

2027
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:55,170
Why didn't you tell me?
- Is he feeling well?

2028
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:57,080
I'll go and find out.
- No. Let it be.

2029
01:43:57,170 --> 01:43:58,630
I'll go and talk to Roopinder.

2030
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:04,630
Yes, dear. What's up?

2031
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:09,080
I am fine. I've set the right
ambience in the house for you.

2032
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:10,330
They are expecting you.

2033
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:13,420
I too have created the right
ambience here to create a scene.

2034
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:15,330
Do whatever you want to,
quickly.

2035
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:18,460
My family is confused
but I'll convince them somehow.

2036
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:19,920
Convince them quickly.

2037
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,040
Otherwise, you will end up
being a guest at my wedding.

2038
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:27,420
Don't you worry.
I won't let that happen.

2039
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:30,250
Someone's coming.
I'll call you back.

2040
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:34,170
Roopinder!

2041
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:35,250
Roop..

2042
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:39,670
You haven't eat anything
since last night.

2043
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:41,460
Don't do this, son.

2044
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:42,750
I am not hungry.

2045
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:46,210
What is wrong? Are you angry or
upset with us? Please tell me.

2046
01:44:46,290 --> 01:44:48,380
We have never said no to you.

2047
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:51,420
But now you will.

2048
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:58,960
Yes, tell me.
- Roop, has your family agreed?

2049
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:02,790
No. I know in this house
no one likes me.

2050
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:06,170
Oh my God.
- Don't say that, brother.

2051
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:08,420
My story is linked to yours.

2052
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:12,750
You are right. We should leave
everything and become hermits.

2053
01:45:12,830 --> 01:45:13,670
No, my son. Don't.

2054
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:15,670
When did I advise you
to become a hermit?

2055
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:18,130
You are saying it.
I'll call you back.

2056
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:21,170
Roopinder..

2057
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:23,170
What are you saying, son?

2058
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:25,880
For what have we
ever refused you?

2059
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:28,130
Tell me, I will agree
to anything you say.

2060
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:31,000
You promise?

2061
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:32,540
I swear on you.

2062
01:45:33,670 --> 01:45:35,000
But dad won't agree.

2063
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:38,250
Then you don't know your mom.

2064
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:40,580
It's my job to convince him.

2065
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:42,130
Just tell me what's the problem.

2066
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:53,670
Yes, dear.
So how is Roopinder feeling?

2067
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:55,540
Did he eat anything?

2068
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,960
Hello.. I am talking to you.

2069
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:03,830
Have you stuffed cotton
in your ears?

2070
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:07,080
You don't keep quiet
even while doing yoga.

2071
01:46:07,170 --> 01:46:08,670
Why are you quiet today?

2072
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:13,290
Fine, don't talk to me
if you don't want to.

2073
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:17,210
Channo, breakfast.

2074
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:18,330
I've already eaten.

2075
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:20,170
I was talking about
breakfast for me.

2076
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:21,920
Your breakfast hasn't
been prepared as yet, uncle.

2077
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,250
What do you mean?

2078
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,210
Aunt has issued an order

2079
01:46:25,290 --> 01:46:27,130
that no food will
be cooked in this house.

2080
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:30,170
What is this I hear, madam?

2081
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:33,790
I am talking to you.

2082
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,420
What's happening in this house?

2083
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:40,460
She is on a hunger strike
and has vowed to keep quiet.

2084
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:42,040
What is Channo saying?

2085
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:44,750
This is cheating.

2086
01:46:44,830 --> 01:46:46,920
You are openly blackmailing me.

2087
01:46:48,630 --> 01:46:53,880
I will go crazy. At least tell
me the reason for this fast.

2088
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:56,790
Hello? Dear?

2089
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:00,130
For God's sake
don't trouble me anymore.

2090
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:02,250
Tell me what's the problem?

2091
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,790
You'll have to sign on
a blank paper unconditionally.

2092
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,460
I can give you a palm print
on a blank page.

2093
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:14,170
I want Roopinder to marry
Mr. Dhillon's daughter of Kheri.

2094
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:18,290
The one to whom I spoke
to over the phone?

2095
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:20,210
Roopinder loves that girl.

2096
01:47:20,290 --> 01:47:22,880
And they have agreed
to get them married.

2097
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,420
Then let's get them married.
I never said no.

2098
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:30,420
But for that we will have

2099
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:32,170
to behave like
we have come from UK.

2100
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:33,790
From UK?
- Yes.

2101
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:35,040
How can one act like that?

2102
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:40,250
The thing is Roopinder
met them as a boy from UK.

2103
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,420
That's why we will
have to act for our son.

2104
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,170
Have you lost your mind?

2105
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:47,670
I won't be able to do
anything like that.

2106
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:50,500
Fine then,
I shall continue my protest.

2107
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:56,830
Where's Roopinder?

2108
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:57,960
Roopinder!

2109
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,130
I hold you under oath,
you cannot say anything to him.

2110
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:12,250
Roopinder, what is this I hear?

2111
01:48:13,790 --> 01:48:15,000
It's sad.

2112
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:17,960
You hid this from me?

2113
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:19,630
From your dad?

2114
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:23,540
You should have spoken
to me at least once.

2115
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,500
What made you think
that I won't stand by you?

2116
01:48:32,290 --> 01:48:33,420
Sorry, dad.

2117
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:38,540
Love you, dad.

2118
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:40,540
You shouldn't lose hope.

2119
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:45,420
Dhillon takes Punjab lightly,
doesn't he?

2120
01:48:45,670 --> 01:48:47,880
Now, we'll pretend to be
from the UK and show him

2121
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,540
the power of Punjab.

2122
01:48:51,250 --> 01:48:53,670
What are you waiting for, dear?
Start preparing.

2123
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:58,130
Yes. Yes.

2124
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:01,210
Alright. Alright.
- No, no, no.

2125
01:49:01,290 --> 01:49:02,920
Oh no. This is not right.

2126
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,880
Oh God.
- Yeah.

2127
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:08,830
Oh God.. - Madam, what have
you gotten me into?

2128
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:11,170
Memorize it sincerely, dear.

2129
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:13,460
I've been trying to memorize
since so long.

2130
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:17,460
Yes! Yes. No. Yeah!

2131
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:19,750
Oh yeah! Yeah!

2132
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:22,580
I got it.
- Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Nice.

2133
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:24,170
I'll rock!

2134
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:26,000
Now hear me talk.

2135
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:30,580
I wanted a daughter-in-law
from Punjab.

2136
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:31,540
Yes.
- No.

2137
01:49:31,630 --> 01:49:32,670
No?
- Called?

2138
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:34,670
Call?
- No, not even that.

2139
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:38,330
I desired a daughter-in-law
from Punjab.

2140
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:40,040
Desired!

2141
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:42,420
She asks and she gets.

2142
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,250
Now hear me talk.
- Okay.

2143
01:49:47,670 --> 01:49:52,960
You have to give in
to your kids' wishes.

2144
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,000
I got it. Now I won't worry.

2145
01:49:58,420 --> 01:49:59,540
This is the first time

2146
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:01,460
I've seen wedding preparations
taking place like this.

2147
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:04,460
Hey, even I have
learnt how to say it.

2148
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:06,330
It's been so long since
I changed my status on Facebook.

2149
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:08,170
Boys must be wondering.
- Boys..

2150
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:09,500
Here's holy offering.

2151
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:12,040
Today is the first
day of the month.

2152
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:13,580
Lord Almighty.

2153
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:16,170
It is the first day of
the month of our calendar.

2154
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:18,960
They are one of us.
They aren't foreigners.

2155
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:23,750
We need your help, Moni. You
are declaring it to the world.

2156
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:24,960
Today is an auspicious day.

2157
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,040
Why not go to the Gurudwara
and say it on the loudspeaker?

2158
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:29,040
'Everyone in the vicinity
is being informed.'

2159
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:30,960
'Two people pretending to be
from UK are in the village.'

2160
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,460
'Lock your doors. Dilip Singh's
daughter is in danger.'

2161
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:36,540
You have taken it to heart.
I was just joking.

2162
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:39,170
Your jokes will ruin us.

2163
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:40,170
Watch out.

2164
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:44,710
Roop, I think your love
story will surpass all.

2165
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:47,460
Hey, he's saying
such bad things.

2166
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:51,290
All epic stories
had a bad ending.

2167
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:53,710
We want to marry them. Right?

2168
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:57,580
Don't you worry.
You have God's blessings.

2169
01:50:57,670 --> 01:50:59,580
Now just wait for
the wedding band to play.

2170
01:50:59,670 --> 01:51:01,040
When should we make
the families meet?

2171
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:02,420
Why delay it any further?

2172
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:04,710
Let's go this evening.
- That's better.

2173
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:07,040
No. Not in the evening. Go now.

2174
01:51:07,130 --> 01:51:09,290
You are not in the state of
going anywhere in the evenings.

2175
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:12,500
My brother is very naughty.

2176
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:23,750
What is her name?
- Gurdisha.

2177
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:26,960
Guru Disha. Nice name.

2178
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:30,460
You have given your daughter
a very rare name.

2179
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:32,920
Oh yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

2180
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,500
Your daughter's name
suits her image.

2181
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:40,210
She is now your
daughter as well.

2182
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:42,920
Now she will come here
only as a guest.

2183
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,460
She can come every
second day if she wants.

2184
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:47,130
We aren't going
to be strict in-laws.

2185
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:52,750
You see..

2186
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:55,830
I still speak like
I used to 30 years ago.

2187
01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:01,290
You know, I told my wife

2188
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:04,170
that I'll try to speak
the local lingo in Punjab.

2189
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:06,170
And I told him
he won't be able to do it.

2190
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:07,460
He must've forgotten it.

2191
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:09,330
I haven't forgotten, darling.
I haven't.

2192
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:11,210
Hey, dad. You speak so well.

2193
01:52:11,290 --> 01:52:13,040
I like it. It's nice.

2194
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:17,460
I'll learn how to speak
the lingo from uncle. - Yeah.

2195
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:20,420
Okay, we can talk about
such things any other time.

2196
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:21,710
Now let's decide

2197
01:52:21,790 --> 01:52:23,580
when we should hold
the engagement and the wedding.

2198
01:52:23,670 --> 01:52:27,080
Right?
- Hey, he's in such a hurry.

2199
01:52:27,170 --> 01:52:29,920
We agree to whatever they say.

2200
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:34,420
Look, we don't believe
in showing off.

2201
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:38,330
We want to keep it simple.

2202
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:40,540
We don't want
to waste any money.

2203
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:42,580
We don't want any gifts either.

2204
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:46,670
There is a bad tradition
in Punjab. What is it called?

2205
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,790
Dowry?
- Yeah.

2206
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:53,210
No dowry. Just the girl.

2207
01:52:53,290 --> 01:52:56,290
You mean you won't
give me a ring either?

2208
01:52:56,380 --> 01:52:59,170
Hey, he is eager than
the bride and the groom.

2209
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:01,170
We'll give you the traditional
gifts to you first.

2210
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:04,420
That's for the girls, DJ. Now
don't say that it's the same.

2211
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:06,330
Whatever you say is right,
brother.

2212
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:07,630
It is your country.

2213
01:53:08,130 --> 01:53:11,580
Look, don't talk about dowry,
please.

2214
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:13,540
You have made me happy,
Mr. Garewal.

2215
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:15,960
This is how they think.

2216
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:19,380
This is why I want my
daughter to marry an NRI.

2217
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:20,540
Yeah.

2218
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:23,750
I suggest we should finalize
everything on the next Sunday.

2219
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:25,420
What say, Kindi?
What do you say?

2220
01:53:26,250 --> 01:53:29,880
Whatever my elders suggest,
I will let my dad know.

2221
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:31,420
Okay.
- Alright.

2222
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:33,920
We'll finalize on Sunday?
- Yeah.

2223
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Yeah?
- You seem eager.

2224
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:37,630
Sorry.

2225
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,290
You shouldn't speak when
your elders are talking.

2226
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:43,420
But it's alright. It's alright.

2227
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:47,040
So, we will come here on Sunday?

2228
01:53:47,130 --> 01:53:48,420
Whatever you say.

2229
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,920
Mr. Dhillon, hear I,
but tell me what's wrong.

2230
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,580
Look, I know
you are nice people.

2231
01:53:59,670 --> 01:54:01,830
But I have given my
consent to someone else.

2232
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:03,960
He too is an NRI.

2233
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:05,460
It does not good look,
Mr. Dhillon.

2234
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:07,830
You know out of lots of girls,
I didn't see any.

2235
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:10,290
Because me very
much look on you.

2236
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:12,960
I cannot speak anymore.
Please talk to Lovely.

2237
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:14,500
Talk to him. He has refused.

2238
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,790
What happened, Mr. Dhillon?

2239
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:20,920
Look, Ms. Lovely,
we never said yes to you.

2240
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,920
But we had our hopes high.

2241
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,750
You know Mintu keeps
looking at your daughter's face

2242
01:54:28,830 --> 01:54:30,580
all day long on Facebook.

2243
01:54:30,670 --> 01:54:31,710
It's okay.

2244
01:54:31,790 --> 01:54:36,250
Now you tell him to stop looking
at Disha's face on Facebook.

2245
01:54:37,290 --> 01:54:38,960
Okay? Bye.

2246
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:40,920
Hello?

2247
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:42,670
Hello?

2248
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:44,460
Did he hang up?

2249
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:46,920
Oh God, I wonder
what ruined it for us.

2250
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,540
I know. Bad luck.

2251
01:54:48,630 --> 01:54:50,170
Now I will turn this
bad luck into good luck.

2252
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:51,420
They are rich.

2253
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,330
I got into this because of you.

2254
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:55,880
If you hadn't wasted
my money in casinos then..

2255
01:54:56,250 --> 01:55:00,170
Then what? Would you be sitting
next to the queen of England?

2256
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:02,880
Hear her talk. Forget the past
and think about the present.

2257
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:07,580
Sorry, darling. I wasn't angry.

2258
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:10,580
We are in here to make others
worry, not worry ourselves.

2259
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:13,330
Let's think of something.
Worry not. Yes.

2260
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:15,880
Don't talk to me in English.

2261
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:18,540
Oh sorry, I forgot.
You are my wife.

2262
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:21,170
You should get serious
at least sometimes.

2263
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:23,170
All the time comedy,
comedy, comedy.

2264
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:25,080
Stupid.
She tells me to get serious.

2265
01:55:25,170 --> 01:55:27,750
I won't get serious.
I want to make others serious.

2266
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:34,080
You have cleaned out my ATM
card even before the wedding.

2267
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:36,920
You'll clean out my credit
cards as well after the wedding.

2268
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,670
You are giving up already?

2269
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:41,210
My real shopping
will begin in UK.

2270
01:55:41,290 --> 01:55:45,460
She is paying all her bills.
She doesn't let me pay.

2271
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:48,880
Don't worry. After the wedding
you'll be paying for everything.

2272
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:49,790
Oh really?

2273
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:52,670
I didn't know getting married
was such a hard work.

2274
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:53,880
How mean.

2275
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:55,710
Just a minute!

2276
01:55:55,790 --> 01:55:57,460
Getting married
is hard work for you?

2277
01:55:57,540 --> 01:55:58,960
Okay. Wait.

2278
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:00,830
I'll go and buy another dress.
- Listen..

2279
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:01,790
Sorry, guys.

2280
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:06,630
If I am not wrong, isn't
that girl Dhillon's daughter?

2281
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,460
Has this girl lost her mind?

2282
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:10,960
Was she crazy from the beginning
or has she just lost her mind?

2283
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,210
You must know.
You know her from a long time.

2284
01:56:12,290 --> 01:56:14,170
Yes. That's her, Mintu.

2285
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,960
But forget about it.
Why should we bother?

2286
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:18,040
Wait a minute.

2287
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:22,580
Isn't that guy whom we met
at Bye-Bye India's office?

2288
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:25,040
I don't believe in black magic.

2289
01:56:25,130 --> 01:56:26,670
Yes. It's him.

2290
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,710
I think he has fixed
Disha's marriage.

2291
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:32,080
He must've fixed it with
the boy standing next to him.

2292
01:56:32,170 --> 01:56:35,540
I think I'll have
to do something now.

2293
01:56:35,630 --> 01:56:37,420
The boy's smart, Mintu.

2294
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:40,920
Your intentions
change very quickly.

2295
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,960
I was just saying.

2296
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:47,170
I don't know much
about such things.

2297
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,580
Why is he smiling so much?

2298
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:53,420
What I don't understand is that
why is he speaking in an accent?

2299
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:57,080
I know, Mintu.
I didn't think about that.

2300
01:56:57,170 --> 01:56:57,960
Then think.

2301
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:01,170
Until I get married, I think..

2302
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:02,750
I think they are elephant teeth.

2303
01:57:02,830 --> 01:57:03,580
Elephant teeth?

2304
01:57:03,670 --> 01:57:05,960
For eating use different ones,
for cheating use different ones.

2305
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:08,790
What do you mean?
- Game.

2306
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:12,540
I think God has given
the game back in our hands.

2307
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,750
So now?
- Now we shall play.

2308
01:57:15,130 --> 01:57:16,290
Let's go.

2309
01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:21,170
Oh, she's there now.
Look at her.

2310
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:22,670
Why are you looking at him?

2311
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:25,630
Just forget him. Remember me.

2312
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,420
I am permanent.

2313
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:29,670
Come on. Just follow me.

2314
01:57:30,790 --> 01:57:32,250
Hello! Let's go.

2315
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:37,630
What are you thinking about,
Ms. Disha?

2316
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,000
Something bothering you?

2317
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:40,880
There's a lot bothering me.

2318
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:43,580
For how long will
we hide the truth?

2319
01:57:43,670 --> 01:57:46,960
You can tell your family
whenever you feel right.

2320
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:49,630
I told you, I won't tell them.

2321
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:52,250
Either you or your family
will tell them.

2322
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:04,710
Hello?

2323
01:58:04,830 --> 01:58:07,170
What is it? You seem to be
in a hurry to get married.

2324
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:10,960
What? What do you mean?

2325
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,920
I mean are you dressed?
Had you placed the head gear?

2326
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,580
Who are you?

2327
01:58:15,670 --> 01:58:17,250
The one who wanted to marry her.

2328
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:20,420
But you boys entered
with fake IDs.

2329
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,830
Come to the point.
What is your problem?

2330
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:25,790
Stop acting smart,
fake UK returned people.

2331
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:30,000
Make sure Roopinder Garewal
from Gilla understands this.

2332
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:32,420
I want to talk..

2333
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:35,920
Hello. Don't waste your time,
Daljeet Jugaadi.

2334
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:40,420
Come and meet me
at Mitra Da Dhaba.

2335
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,830
Hello? Hello?

2336
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,040
Hello?

2337
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:47,880
What's this new problem
that has cropped up?

2338
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:50,880
Hello?

2339
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:54,580
Hello, Roop? Our hard work
is going down the drain.

2340
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:56,580
What happened?
Why are you getting hyper?

2341
01:58:56,670 --> 01:58:58,290
We are ruined.

2342
01:58:58,380 --> 01:58:59,960
You'll be divorced even
before you can get married.

2343
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:00,920
Have you lost your mind?

2344
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,210
I'm fine, but I guess we'll have
to help someone find his.

2345
01:59:04,290 --> 01:59:07,460
Do one thing.
Come and meet me. Right away.

2346
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:08,750
Okay. I am coming.

2347
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:30,040
It's ringing.

2348
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:32,670
It's him.
- Answer it.

2349
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:34,710
Yes?

2350
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:36,960
Hello? Look straight ahead.

2351
01:59:37,670 --> 01:59:38,960
Where are you?

2352
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,540
In front of you.

2353
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:42,500
On the table.

2354
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,290
Drinking tea.

2355
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,880
Over there.
He's sitting over there.

2356
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:50,670
I think he has escaped
from the zoo.

2357
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:01,670
Hello.

2358
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:03,830
Yes. Yes.

2359
02:00:04,130 --> 02:00:05,250
Have a seat.

2360
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:11,540
You have identified
me correctly.

2361
02:00:11,830 --> 02:00:12,880
Wouldn't have it been better

2362
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,040
if you would've made a deal
with me earlier?

2363
02:00:14,130 --> 02:00:15,170
What do you want?

2364
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:17,170
I want Dhillon's daughter
to be my wife.

2365
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:18,790
I'll kill you.

2366
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,960
No, no, no. A case will
be registered under section 302.

2367
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,710
You'll die unnecessarily.

2368
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:24,960
I'll talk to Dhillon right away.

2369
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,920
Who are you in the truth
of life!

2370
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,250
Just a minute.

2371
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:32,960
First tell me,
why you have called us here?

2372
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:34,460
I want to make a deal.

2373
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:37,500
That too for just
10 million rupees.

2374
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:41,750
Otherwise I'll go and
create a scene at your wedding.

2375
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:44,040
What do we do now?

2376
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:46,130
What's there to do?

2377
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:49,460
We'll give him 10 million
rupees. He deserves it.

2378
02:00:49,540 --> 02:00:52,130
You have cash?
- I do. In my office.

2379
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:55,670
Deal done, my friend.

2380
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:57,290
But you will have to
come with me to my office.

2381
02:00:57,380 --> 02:00:58,670
Because the cash is over there.

2382
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:00,790
Not I mind.
You can take me anywhere.

2383
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:02,420
Full money. Full deal.

2384
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:03,670
So sweet of you.

2385
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:08,130
Here, we have paid you.

2386
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,920
We didn't wait till the wedding.

2387
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,920
I was just kidding, brother.

2388
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,040
I know you too
are kidding, right?

2389
02:01:14,130 --> 02:01:15,290
10 million, right?

2390
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:18,290
If you think 10 million is
a lot, give me 100,000.

2391
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:21,210
It doesn't suit you
to refuse a friend, right?

2392
02:01:21,290 --> 02:01:22,920
He is shameless.

2393
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,420
Please listen to me, brother.

2394
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:26,290
I'll be fine even
if you give me currency

2395
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:27,790
from the years prior to 2005.

2396
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:29,170
What other discount
can I offer you?

2397
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:31,290
Let's go, DJ.
- Come on, untie me.

2398
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:34,460
Untie you? I'll slap you.

2399
02:01:34,540 --> 02:01:36,080
Darn you,
you should bathe sometimes.

2400
02:01:36,170 --> 02:01:38,040
Your clothes stink. - Where are
you taking my clothes?

2401
02:01:38,130 --> 02:01:40,040
Listen.
Hello, brother. My clothes..

2402
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:42,290
Stop talking nonsense.
I am not taking all of them.

2403
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:43,540
You can keep some.

2404
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:46,040
My clothes!

2405
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,130
Stay in the character.

2406
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:55,080
Our hard work will be ruined
if anyone finds out the truth.

2407
02:01:55,170 --> 02:01:59,290
The one we have tied up is
the one who is getting ruined.

2408
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:02,250
That fool tried to mess with us.

2409
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:05,830
Look, all weddings
should be like this one.

2410
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:08,830
No commotion, no crowds.

2411
02:02:09,250 --> 02:02:13,750
Mr. Chawla, how many in India
can you convince?

2412
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:16,630
Here show off
equals to marriage.

2413
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:20,880
Excuse me, Mr. Dhillon?
What's the delay?

2414
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:23,710
If it's okay with you shall we
go ahead with the ring ceremony?

2415
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:24,920
Thank God he remembered.

2416
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:28,330
I was worried that if it gets
delayed, things could get worse.

2417
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:29,790
Stay in the character.

2418
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:31,830
Our hard work will be ruined
if anyone finds out the truth.

2419
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:33,000
What did you say?

2420
02:02:34,540 --> 02:02:35,670
Who are you talking about?

2421
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:39,170
You don't have time
to come and meet me.

2422
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:43,750
I was telling DJ that you look
beautiful in this dress.

2423
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,580
Hot and happening chick!

2424
02:02:46,670 --> 02:02:50,250
Hey, even my girl is
looking beautiful today.

2425
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:52,420
She's feeling shy.

2426
02:03:11,130 --> 02:03:13,460
Hello?
- Hello!

2427
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:16,290
Such a big hello?
I guess our job is done!

2428
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:18,750
My game is nearing end.
Come early.

2429
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:21,290
DJ has locked me in his office.
Hurry up.

2430
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:24,330
Oh my God. Don't worry. I'll
come right away. Don't worry.

2431
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:26,880
Fine. Listen,
get some clothes for me.

2432
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:29,210
And also..
Hello? Hello?

2433
02:03:29,290 --> 02:03:32,210
It got disconnected? Women
never hear everything.

2434
02:03:32,290 --> 02:03:33,710
They can keep talking nonstop

2435
02:03:33,790 --> 02:03:35,040
but never listen
to what's important.

2436
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:40,380
Yes, mom?

2437
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:43,000
Come, son. Let's begin
the ring ceremony.

2438
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:44,080
Yes.

2439
02:03:44,170 --> 02:03:47,420
This isn't a ring but
a commitment of a lifetime.

2440
02:03:49,170 --> 02:03:50,170
Now.

2441
02:03:57,540 --> 02:03:59,040
No, you first put it
on my finger.

2442
02:03:59,130 --> 02:04:01,080
They have exchanged the rings.
Now everything will be fine.

2443
02:04:01,170 --> 02:04:03,790
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

2444
02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:06,460
Wait a minute.
One second.

2445
02:04:06,540 --> 02:04:07,750
What's the hurry?

2446
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:11,830
Which idiot tried
to stop the engagement?

2447
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:14,290
Me. Myself. In front of you.

2448
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:17,080
Who is this person who has come
here like this? Who is this?

2449
02:04:17,170 --> 02:04:18,750
Who is this beggar?
Get him out of here.

2450
02:04:18,830 --> 02:04:20,880
Mr. Dhillon, at least
you shouldn't be saying that.

2451
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:24,460
Trace me with care.
Me. Mintu NRI. From Canada.

2452
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:26,290
What have you done to yourself?

2453
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:28,080
You have come in shorts
for a wedding.

2454
02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:29,040
Don't you have any shame?

2455
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:31,420
These two have done this to me.

2456
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:34,540
That was sitting on chairs.

2457
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:37,170
I am telling the truth,
Mr. Dhillon.

2458
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:38,540
Cancel their marriage.

2459
02:04:38,630 --> 02:04:41,040
Who are you
to cancel the marriage?

2460
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:43,210
You have been cheated,
Mr. Dhillon.

2461
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:45,080
These boys aren't from UK.

2462
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:46,540
Really?

2463
02:04:46,630 --> 02:04:47,830
You are doing this

2464
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:49,960
because I am not getting
her married to your cousin.

2465
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:52,040
They are not NRIs,
they are Indians.

2466
02:04:52,130 --> 02:04:53,290
One moment.

2467
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:55,750
Isn't your name
Mahinder Pal Singh?

2468
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:58,040
Yes, I was. I mean I am.

2469
02:04:58,130 --> 02:05:00,170
Aren't you from village Dalle?
- Yes, I am.

2470
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:03,460
Aren't you two husband and wife?
- Yes, we are.

2471
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:04,420
100 percent!

2472
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:05,330
Look at that.
- Hear that!

2473
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:06,670
Hear that!

2474
02:05:07,830 --> 02:05:09,830
You are such cheap people?

2475
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:11,670
You two are husband and wife?

2476
02:05:12,250 --> 02:05:13,420
You scoundrel!

2477
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,540
Beat me! Beat me!

2478
02:05:15,630 --> 02:05:17,040
But truth is truth.

2479
02:05:17,130 --> 02:05:18,540
They are frauds.

2480
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:21,330
They have never been to Goa,
so how can they go to UK.

2481
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:24,920
You are a fraud
and you are defaming others?

2482
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,000
He is Roopinder Singh Garewal
from Gilla.

2483
02:05:29,670 --> 02:05:31,670
And the one
who is pretending to be DJ

2484
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:33,630
he is Daljeet Singh Jugaadi.

2485
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:36,460
He runs a company called
Bye-Bye India

2486
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:38,880
in a dirty building in Jirakpur.

2487
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:39,960
Yes.

2488
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:42,920
And they are the ones who have
started all this drama. - Yes.

2489
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,830
And let me tell you, their
parents are also a part of it.

2490
02:05:50,130 --> 02:05:52,750
Mr. Garewal,
why are you quiet?

2491
02:05:53,290 --> 02:05:55,080
Make them shut up.

2492
02:05:55,170 --> 02:05:57,210
Speak up, Mr. Garewal.

2493
02:05:57,290 --> 02:05:59,630
Cat caught the tongue
of the people from UK?

2494
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:05,540
Look, Mr. Dhillon,
we are from Gilla.

2495
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,500
Just a minute.

2496
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:12,460
Aren't you the Garewal from
Gilla who had called me once?

2497
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:13,580
For my daughter's
hand in marriage?

2498
02:06:13,670 --> 02:06:14,580
Yes, I am.

2499
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:18,540
I had clearly told you
not to call me again.

2500
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,830
But you are so cheap that

2501
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:23,290
you came here
with a wedding procession?

2502
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:24,790
Shame on you.

2503
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:26,750
You should feel ashamed.

2504
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:29,250
You are the one
who should feel ashamed.

2505
02:06:29,630 --> 02:06:32,830
You couldn't find a single boy
in Punjab for your daughter!

2506
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:35,330
She is my daughter. I can
get her married anywhere I want.

2507
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:36,710
Who are you to interfere?

2508
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:40,580
I am the father of the boy
who loves your daughter.

2509
02:06:40,670 --> 02:06:43,750
This means you can lie
and get them married.

2510
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:46,040
You didn't leave
any option for them.

2511
02:06:46,130 --> 02:06:47,420
It is my fault, uncle.

2512
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,790
Don't say anything
to my parents. I forced them.

2513
02:06:53,790 --> 02:06:57,420
Mr. Dhillon, we want
our kids to be happy, right?

2514
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:00,040
What difference does it make?
- Wonderful.

2515
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:04,130
That means all of you were
fooling me.

2516
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:06,580
You kept my daughter
in dark as well.

2517
02:07:06,670 --> 02:07:07,880
No, dad.

2518
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:09,670
I knew everything.

2519
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:14,130
I tried telling you
a number of times

2520
02:07:15,130 --> 02:07:16,500
but I couldn't gather
the courage.

2521
02:07:19,130 --> 02:07:22,790
You were stubborn on
getting me married to an NRI.

2522
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,170
I didn't force you
to marry an NRI, did I?

2523
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:28,040
I always asked your opinion.

2524
02:07:28,130 --> 02:07:29,960
I couldn't tell you
even when I wanted to.

2525
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:34,540
I thought we will tell you
whenever we get a chance.

2526
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:36,960
But we were scared.

2527
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:38,830
You have always done
whatever you pleased.

2528
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:41,710
You should listen
to others too sometimes.

2529
02:07:41,790 --> 02:07:43,210
Have everyone said
what they wanted to?

2530
02:07:43,290 --> 02:07:44,880
Has everyone given
their justification?

2531
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:49,170
I wouldn't have refused
if Disha would've told me

2532
02:07:49,250 --> 02:07:50,540
that she likes him.

2533
02:07:50,630 --> 02:07:52,420
You mean you give
your consent for this?

2534
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:08,130
That's great Dhillon, you were
so determined to go abroad

2535
02:08:09,380 --> 02:08:11,920
that you could never
keep your family happy.

2536
02:08:12,830 --> 02:08:16,040
You forgot that there
is a life here as well.

2537
02:08:17,250 --> 02:08:19,290
What should we think?
Is it a yes or a no?

2538
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:20,790
Do you want it in writing now?

2539
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:24,960
Exchange your rings.

2540
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:46,960
Why are you so upset, brother?

2541
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:48,420
Come, give me a hug.

2542
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:52,920
To whom? The one from UK
or the one from Gilla?

2543
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,670
The ones from UK
always blabber in their accent.

2544
02:08:56,250 --> 02:08:58,420
You will have to hug
the one from Gilla.

2545
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:00,460
Come on.

2546
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:02,040
You scoundrel.

2547
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:06,830
Hello?

2548
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:08,040
Yeah.

2549
02:09:08,130 --> 02:09:09,250
Okay. Okay. Okay.

2550
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:10,880
Was that the cops?

2551
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:12,880
There's a proposal
from a girl in Phagwara.

2552
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,460
She is very rich.

2553
02:09:14,540 --> 02:09:17,420
Where there is a tea,
there is a way. - What?

2554
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:18,710
Where there is a will
there is a way.

2555
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:20,420
These idiots don't
even know English.

2556
02:09:21,130 --> 02:09:22,670
What are you two
whispering about?

2557
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:26,040
Nothing, brother.
They are getting cash gifts.

2558
02:09:26,130 --> 02:09:28,580
Can you please check if
they have change for a hundred?

2559
02:09:28,670 --> 02:09:29,920
Okay.

2560
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Please go.

2561
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:32,670
I am going to run
like Milkha Singh.

2562
02:09:32,750 --> 02:09:34,170
You can run like P.T. Usha
if you can.

2563
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:35,250
Come on, run.

2564
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:38,170
My sponge like heart

2565
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:41,170
wishes me to put a ring
on your beautiful finger.

2566
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:42,580
You can put in all ten of them.

2567
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:45,210
You will make the one
from Jirakpur go bankrupt.

2568
02:09:45,290 --> 02:09:46,920
Do one thing.
Let me put it in one.

2569
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,920
The other nine,
after we get to UK.

2570
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:49,960
Okay.

2571
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:56,040
By the way where will we
go after the wedding?

2572
02:09:56,130 --> 02:09:59,080
On a honeymoon. You want
us to go on a pilgrimage?

2573
02:09:59,170 --> 02:10:00,960
Yes. But where will you take me?

2574
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:03,710
OBT.
- Which country is that?

2575
02:10:03,790 --> 02:10:06,670
On that pumping station
where you said yes.

2576
02:10:06,750 --> 02:10:09,130
You are still acting like
a local. The pumping station.

2577
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:11,420
I found a tube well in Southall.

2578
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:14,540
You mean we are going to UK?
- Yes.

2579
02:10:16,670 --> 02:10:19,920
Now the boys from UK
should go to UK.

2580
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,170
What say?

2581
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:31,040
'They do incredible things
non-stop.'

2582
02:10:31,130 --> 02:10:35,080
'Foreigners are crazy
about their good looks.'

2583
02:10:35,170 --> 02:10:40,210
'They are heroes,
not zeroes from Hollywood.'

2584
02:10:40,290 --> 02:10:44,330
'Modern yet traditional are
