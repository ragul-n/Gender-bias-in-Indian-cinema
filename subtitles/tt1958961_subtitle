That's a good idea.

527
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,041
There's booze in that.

528
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,485
(IN ENGLISH) Yes, homemade.

529
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,045
That's some Norwegian cuisine
I could learn to love.

530
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,121
Mmm.

531
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,610
(m NORWEGIAN) I'm hungry.

532
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,446
You should call room service.

533
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,881
What did you do back in the States?

534
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,210
I had a restaurant, a little bar.

535
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,849
(IN NORWEGIAN)
You seem to know a lot about guns and...

536
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,562
(IN ENGLISH) ...getting rid of evidence...

537
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,849
(IN NORWEGIAN)
...and pistols, for just a restaurant guy.

538
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,647
You kiddin'?

539
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,845
You ever seen the Cooking Channel?

540
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,971
It can get pretty rough.

541
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,647
What the hell?

542
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,048
Any naked ladies?

543
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,161
Yeah.

544
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,251

546
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,721
TORGEIR: Look at him!

547
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,529
Holy shit! Look at this.

548
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,681
(BOTH LAUGHING)

549
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,527
She can't be more than 15, 16 years old.

550
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,965
I've driven her and her mom
to school several times.

551
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,805
He works for the county.

552
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,881
That's interesting.

553
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,521
- I am getting sick.
-TORGEIR: Look at him!

554
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,445
I am shocked!

555
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,367
This is serious business.

556
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,849
He works for the county.

557
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,647
Roar.

558
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,841
(IN ENGLISH) Look who's here.

559
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,206
Be cool, okay?

560
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,961
Follow my lead.

561
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,011
Oh, hello.

562
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,201
LAILA: (IN ENGLISH) Hi.

563
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,489
(IN NORWEGIAN) Well, been on a long trip?

564
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,809
Just out enjoying your lovely scenery.

565
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,003
We've had a report about illegal hunting
in this area.

566
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,921
(IN NORWEGIAN) Wow!

567
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,490
Illegal hunting...

568
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,481
(IN ENGLISH) That's crazy.

569
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,401
We have a witness.

570
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,521
Supervisor Antonsen.

571
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,206
He saw illegal hunting
in the Mesna hills yesterday.

572
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,605
If you have something to say
it would be wise to do it now.

573
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,124
(IN NORWEGIAN) We were...

574
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,170
(IN ENGLISH) We don't really have anything
to say because we didn't see anything.

575
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,806
Did you see these guys yesterday?

576
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,121
No.

577
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,770
No?

578
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,090
The ones I saw were younger fellas.

579
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,400
LAILA: But you said
you saw the Lien brothers.

580
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,682
ANTONSEN: My eyesight
clearly isn't as good as it used to be.

581
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,161
LAILA: Isn't it, now?

582
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,207
The ones I saw must have been
some youths from Oslo.

583
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,689
Youths from Oslo are the worst.

584
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,286
(IN ENGLISH) So, now that we've cleared up
that little misunderstanding,

585
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,808
why don't we all go inside and have a drink?

586
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,687
Thank you, but we'd better be off...

587
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,844
Always good to help the authorities.

588
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,130
Especially when they're neighbors.

589

(FRANK CHUCKLES)

590
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,281
How ya doin'?

591
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,127
(IN NORWEGIAN)
I don't think we have an appointment today.

592
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,201
(IN ENGLISH) I think we do.

593
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,201
(IN NORWEGIAN) If you think you can come
charging in here with more bribes...

594
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,446
(IN ENGLISH)
Yeah, well, that's my appointment.

595
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,881
(IN NORWEGIAN) What's this?

596
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,126
But, how have you got hold of these?

597
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,680
(IN ENGLISH) The real question is,
what am I gonna do with them?

598
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,761
Is this blackmail?

599
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,641
Definitely.

600
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,724
Where I come from, these kind of pictures
could be a problem for a public official,

601
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,087
(MOCKING) but maybe that's just
cultural differences.

602
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,765
Could be a problem here as well. Absolutely.

603
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,561
Okay.

604
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,885
So, how about I make the pictures disappear
and you do a little something for me.

605
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:10,721
Is this about the New Start course?
I can get you off, it's no problem.

606
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,881
Nah.

607
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,851
I wanna take that course
and this is gonna be my teacher.

608
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,290
(IN NORWEGIAN)
She has been here for some interviews...

609
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,089
(IN ENGLISH)
She's not working here, you know.

610
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,690
Is that gonna be a problem?

611
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,766
No, no, no, no, no.

612
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,361
All right.

613
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,445
So now all we gotta do is take care of
the license for my sports bar.

614
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,765
Yeah, you know, as I said,
that's a very complicated...

615
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,967
I understand.

616
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,361
Wait, wait, wait, I can... I can call a guy.

617
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,765
(IN NORWEGIAN) I think maybe
I have a friend in the Department of Industry...

618
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,124
(IN ENGLISH) Listen, last time, you mentioned
something about financial motivation...

619
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,281
Yeah, <i>I</i> did.

620
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,969
But now, this is all the motivation
we need, pally.

621
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,924
Make that fucking phone call.

622
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,281
Yep.

623

Of course it's
good enough to own. (CHUCKLES)

00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,921
Nothing.
