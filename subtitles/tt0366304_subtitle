1
00:00:05,447 --> 00:00:08,610
ln June, 1940, the Nobel Laureate..

2
00:00:08,684 --> 00:00:13,121
..Shri Rabindranath Tagore
had mentioned about his story..

3
00:00:13,188 --> 00:00:19,127
..Choker Bali that he had always
regretted the end of this story.

4
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:50,885
Dear friend, Lakshmi.

5
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:54,661
Knowing that the wedding
ceremony of your daughter..

6
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,493
..Binodini has been fixed..

7
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:58,658
..gives me immense pleasure.

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,494
l take an oath of
the Goddess Lakshmi..

9
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,562
..my dear friend, even
if you take my life away..

10
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:06,664
..please do not misunderstand me.

11
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:10,369
Your daughter Binodini is
very cultured and accomplished.

12
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,676
And she has been worthy in all
respects to become my daughter-in-law.

13
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:18,183
But educated youths of
today do not care for anyone.

14
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:20,847
Where do they
listen to their elders?

15
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,353
l continue to burn in
the fire of repentance..

16
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:28,191
..which has arisen due to
my son Mahendra's mistake..

17
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:30,390
..of rejecting this alliance.

18
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:36,197
Although not my own progeny,
Behari is no less than my own son.

19
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:39,606
l had hoped that he would
listen to this unfortunate soul..

20
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:41,699
..but he refused, too.

21
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:44,605
l apologize for
this behaviour of his.

22
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:48,372
Now, on Binodini's
marriage to Bipin.

23
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:53,213
l send her ornaments,
sweets and fifty rupees.

24
00:01:53,622 --> 00:01:55,749
My heartfelt prayers..

25
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,760
..that she enjoys
life-long wedded bliss.

26
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:04,422
Your friend Raj Lakshmi.

27
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:08,399
Binodini becomes a widow
within one year of her marriage.

28
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:23,744
Are you expected to
remain uncovered like this?

29
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,433
This place is very
different from your father's house.

30
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:46,665
Do you intend to stay on here?

31
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:56,008
Now that your husband's no more,
do you still wish to live here?

32
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:03,790
You have no choice.

33
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,290
Was he ailing?

34
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:12,293
What happened?

35
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,494
Something in his stomach.

36
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:20,807
We call it.. 'pleha'.

37
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:25,640
l mean, 'piley'.

38
00:03:25,714 --> 00:03:26,806
You mean, spleen?

39
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:28,474
Yes, spleen.

40
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:31,648
His spleen became very large.

41
00:03:32,654 --> 00:03:37,819
My dear, you must not
lose touch with your books

42
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:41,322
Before l forget.

43
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:46,492
Your favorite chocolates.

44
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:52,835
You are allowed to
have them still, l hope.

45
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:23,697
Thank you.

46
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:28,441
Don't worry, my dear.
There's no animal fat or lard.

47
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:52,933
(Extract from a famous Bankim
novel about a renegade widow)

48
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,903
Rohini was in the full blush of
youth, her beauty over-flowing..

49
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:59,600
..as the full moon in
it's glowing autumnal phase.

50
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,610
Widowed very young, she flouted
the strictures placed on widows.

51
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:09,411
She wore black-bordered saris,
bangles, chewed betel-leaf perhaps..

52
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:12,817
..her culinary skills could
match the legendary Draupadi's.

53
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:17,915
And her unrivalled artistry.. She was
excellent in preparing delicacies.

54
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:21,759
Who else could paint such
lovely floor decorations..

55
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,923
..or make intricate ornaments,
flowers, toys and embroidery?

56
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:28,834
She alone knew how to style
coiffures and adorn brides.

57
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:33,033
These very accomplishments
drove her to her death.

58
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:37,442
God will surely
punish a widow who strays.

59
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:41,949
God doesn't issue the death
penalty so easily, Ma. Judges do.

60
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,518
You're aware that
Sir Bankim was a judge?

61
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:47,521
When you write a novel,
some colur has to be added.

62
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:52,117
Would stories on dull widows
like us, appeal to the young?

63
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:58,462
No chance. Women in Bankim's novels
are dull, not one knows English.

64
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:05,632
lf that's what you wanted, why
did you reject Bipin's wife?

65
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:08,676
The novel is 'Rajmohan's Wife',
not 'Bipin's Wife.'

66
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,973
Rajmohan? His name's Bipin.

67
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:13,480
You disregarded
Bipin's wfe's photograph.

68
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:19,645
Ma, you'll be arrested. Do you
want me to marry someone else's wife?

69
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:24,887
l told you she's accomplished..
Learnt English from a white tutor.

70
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,486
She also went to an English
studio to get herself photographed.

71
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:30,656
Such friendship that
both of you turned her down.

72
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:34,998
Widow in a year, poor girl.

73
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,504
Contact her again. Such
arguments in college today.

74
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:44,170
Mahendra ranting that if at all he
marries, it should be to a widow.

75
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:48,011
l had to turn back, madam,
couldn't reach the market place.

76
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,711
Such crowds on the streets.

77
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,015
Naren Dutta passed away.

78
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:56,016
Who?

79
00:06:56,591 --> 00:07:01,585
The monk of Belur Math the
ashram full of tonsured monks.

80
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:03,528
Not a single vehicle can pass.

81
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:05,859
Swamiji!

82
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:11,868
l had seen him recently.
Not even 40, gone so young!

83
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,138
With your mentor gone, will
you shave your head too, Behari?

84
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:21,038
l'm going home.

85
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:22,947
Shall l send the vessels back?

86
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:26,748
Will the demise of your
ascetic guru end your celibacy?

87
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:48,576
Respected gurudev, l
touch your feet in reverence.

88
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,273
You are aware of the ups and
downs of my troubled life.

89
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:58,910
lt's my good fortune that you
remember this lowly disciple.

90
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:01,588
You are omniscient.

91
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:04,921
You know everything by the
virtue of your yogic powers.

92
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,652
Whatever happens is by
God's and your will.

93
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,932
My orphaned niece,
Ashalata lives with..

94
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:18,939
..her paternal uncle,
the local guardian.

95
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:22,933
He comes to me with her
marriage proposal for Behari.

96
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:29,014
He feared that she would
remain a life-long spinster.

97
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:43,697
l was stupid to have sent my son
like Behari to choose the girl.

98
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:49,968
Mahendra, being a close friend,
escorted Behari to Ashalata's home.

99
00:08:57,312 --> 00:09:03,979
On seeing Ashalata, Mahendra
decided to marry her instead.

100
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:24,671
On Mahendra's pleas, l
requested Behari to give her up.

101
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,002
Behari stepped aside graciously.

102
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:33,737
Mahendra's wedding to
Ashalata was duly concluded.

103
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:57,304
l know that a life
partner is predestined.

104
00:09:57,372 --> 00:10:00,705
The Almighty and yourself
would be the only ones..

105
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:03,300
..to know the ties these newly
weds had in the previous birth.

106
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:10,716
l berate myself for the
hurt l have caused Behari.

107
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:19,052
You're all seeing of
the future and the past.

108
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:25,733
l beg you to shower blessings on
Behari that he may find peace.

109
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:33,229
l seek pardon for my sins
and shelter beneath your feet.

110
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:37,901
l remain your humble disciple,
Annapurna.

111
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:52,415
You didn't go to
college today as well

112
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:55,155
Can't you drop that
mincing manner either?

113
00:10:58,099 --> 00:11:03,765
People will say l'm bad. That l
keep you away from your books.

114
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:09,167
What people?

115
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:14,109
Tell me!

116
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:22,186
Will you take me to the
Kali temple next Saturday?

117
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:28,288
To offset people calling you bad?

118
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:35,126
While drawing water from the well,
my gold chain fell in.

119
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:40,864
l tied a knot in my
sari in the Lord's name..

120
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:44,139
..promising to offer prayers at
the temple if the chain was found.

121
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:46,339
Yesterday it was retrieved.

122
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:51,816
Why should you draw the water?
Where's the maid?

123
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:56,480
Let her be. Must l sit idle all day?

124
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,153
Won't people say l'm bad?

125
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,988
Tell me, who are they?
You haven't told me yet.

126
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,024
My uncle, for instance.

127
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:10,500
He trained me well to
manage my husband's home.

128
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:15,342
lf he hears that l am not
doing so, won't he feel insulted?

129
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:21,005
That's an insult? Tricking somebody
to marry a girl isn't an insult?

130
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:23,013
What trick?

131
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:27,851
l was told that you could sing.
That day when l asked..

132
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:30,356
Behari asked me not to.

133
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,187
Ok. Then go to Behari.

134
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:40,194
lf people label you bad,
do not blame me.

135
00:12:42,937 --> 00:12:45,201
What shall l sing?

136
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:52,208
Just singing won't do.
l'll inspect your heels..

137
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:54,471
..your teeth..

138
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:59,376
..hair, in steps.

139
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:05,548
l first saw you on
someone else's behalf.

140
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,227
Or would l have let
you off so easily?

141
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:15,401
lf you take your feet away..

142
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:18,228
..people will say you're bad.

143
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:22,065
All these are
excuses to skip college.

144
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:24,108
ln college..

145
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,241
..do you know what l do?

146
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:28,407
What?

147
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:32,412
l examine women's heels..

148
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,922
..their hips..

149
00:13:37,325 --> 00:13:39,088
..their chests.

150
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:43,086
Then don't go!

151
00:13:47,001 --> 00:13:50,095
From where did you bring
this witch into my family?

152
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:54,104
She's made a meek lamb of my son.

153
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:02,143
Asha, open the door.

154
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,113
Where's Asha?

155
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:13,954
She's resting, slight stomachache.
Make her some barley, aunt.

156
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:17,589
Tell him that barley is all
they'll get day and night.

157
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:21,126
ln a house where deities
are worshipped daily..

158
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:24,365
..l won't tolerate fish
bones strewn around bedrooms.

159
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,467
Witch!

160
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:35,978
Madam Lakshmi, please
don't get angry and leave.

161
00:14:37,318 --> 00:14:38,478
Where did she go, aunty?

162
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:42,147
To her country home.

163
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:46,054
Rajlakshmi goes back to
her native village.

164
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:44,063
Binodini who stays
there supports her.

165
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:47,527
What a sinful habit
you have taught me!

166
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:49,535
l now crave for
tea every afternoon.

167
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:52,603
Take it as a remedy for headache.
You'll not feel guilty.

168
00:16:52,673 --> 00:16:54,004
That's no excuse.

169
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:57,601
Can a Brahmin widow have tea?
That which the English consume!?

170
00:16:57,744 --> 00:17:00,542
Tea is not made by the white.

171
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,348
Close the windows. The
light burns my eyes.

172
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:13,086
Don't misunderstand me.

173
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,690
Having servants has
lead to my giving orders.

174
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:20,527
l don't like stirring an inch.

175
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:25,295
Why should you when l'm here?
Order and l'll obey.

176
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,432
That's not correct. You
have your own household.

177
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:32,205
Neglecting all that to
tend to an old woman.

178
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:38,215
My household is in two rooms,
which l attend to in the morning.

179
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,053
What do you do the rest of the day?

180
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:43,783
Have your tea or
else it'll get cold.

181
00:17:44,124 --> 00:17:47,389
Who's there to chat with at home?

182
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:51,261
You have a new daughter-in-law.
ls she a quiet sort?

183
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,395
Only in my presence.

184
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:58,802
She's locked in the bedroom all
day, casting spells on my son.

185
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:00,464
Turned him into a sheep.

186
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:03,065
Then she must be beautiful.

187
00:18:03,143 --> 00:18:09,139
Thin as a stick. Brides tend to
get plump after getting married.

188
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:12,413
This one sold her flesh to the
butcher in her previous birth.

189
00:18:12,586 --> 00:18:15,487
Next to her, my son
looks like Lord Kartikeya!

190
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:18,422
Won't he visit here?
l would see him then.

191
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:22,389
l also thought that they'd come.

192
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:26,428
Earlier he wouldn't
eat until l served food.

193
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:29,760
From that day till date..

194
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:34,298
..he's not asked once,
if l'm dead or alive.

195
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:38,434
l have a letter from
Calcutta from Mahendra.

196
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:42,278
l met the postman on my way.

197
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:46,283
You should have told me earlier.
l blamed him for no reason.

198
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:47,513
Where is it?

199
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:49,786
lt's not addressed to you.

200
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,118
Who then?

201
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:54,126
The envelope says,
Beharilal Chowdhury.

202
00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:59,791
The one who escorted me here? He
probably thinks Behari is here.

203
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:03,632
Will you hand him the
letter on your return?

204
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:06,136
Why? Read it out.

205
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:08,140
Read someone else's letter?

206
00:19:08,642 --> 00:19:11,805
Listen! Reserve this
decorum for your own home.

207
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:17,475
lt's from my son. l must
know whether he is well.

208
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:22,315
God forbid, if something's wrong!
Should it stay unread, while l worry?

209
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:27,357
lf it offends you,
someone else can read it to me.

210
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,365
My dearest friend Behari..

211
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:42,165
l thought that the muse of
poetry had abandoned me..

212
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:45,336
..when your
sister-in-law came into my life.

213
00:19:46,346 --> 00:19:49,509
From her point of view,
this is life.

214
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:54,848
But in these sweets moments,
today, l see that this is not so.

215
00:19:56,256 --> 00:20:02,195
We were asleep in bed when the
clock of the Armenian church..

216
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:08,201
..loudly declared that it was 3 a.m.

217
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:13,205
l got up, lit a lamp
and sat at my desk.

218
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,869
Should l put it
back in the envelope?

219
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:25,217
Don't mind my harsh words, dear.

220
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:30,219
Your tea's cold.

221
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,222
Like a thief with great stealth..

222
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:38,389
..from under the cover
of the mosquito net..

223
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:41,901
..observing the beauty of your
sister-in-law in her sleep..

224
00:20:41,968 --> 00:20:45,734
..whether from
habit or inspiration..

225
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:51,574
..l penned a few
formal exchanges to my love.

226
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:55,408
The lady to whom these
lines are addressed..

227
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:58,747
..will not be able to
read the poetic flow..

228
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:00,912
..of my English verse.

229
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:05,257
l know your sister-in-law will not
be able to understand the feeling.

230
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:08,258
So l am sending it
to you in trepidation.

231
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:10,589
Yours ever, Mahendra.

232
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:13,758
l live in hope, sweet hope..

233
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,266
..in thy embrace such joy l found.

234
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:21,330
Me thought l lay in
a vale of asphodel.

235
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:25,339
Whose honey odors
yet doth me surround.

236
00:21:25,445 --> 00:21:29,677
A dizzy drought of bliss
that never shall quell..

237
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:36,346
Bless me, but this is a love poem.
ln a man's hand too, Binodini.

238
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:40,621
lt is not to me. l
tell you truly, sister.

239
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:42,958
lt is my friend Asha's.

240
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:45,792
She cannot read English so..

241
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:50,302
Really, you girls!
Well now, let's see.

242
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,964
Which is the part
you find difficult?

243
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,476
Some of the words..
like this word, 'bower'.

244
00:21:57,544 --> 00:21:59,808
l know what 'bow' means, but..

245
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,476
lts pronounced bower, dear. Come,
let's read it together.

246
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:11,651
Thy ruby lips, like a rain
drenched passion flowers.

247
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:16,494
Thy blushing cheeks,
like blooming roses.

248
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:20,499
Dear me! This is a very
passionate poem indeed.

249
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:22,660
Who gave it to your friend?

250
00:22:22,736 --> 00:22:30,836
lt is from her husband,
sister. He likes writing poetry.

251
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:37,075
She cannot read English at all.
So she gave it to me.

252
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,678
Perhaps we should not read
poetry from a husband to his wife.

253
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:44,519
Please, sister, l promised her.

254
00:22:46,426 --> 00:22:51,022
Thy honey skin, like
love's golden power.

255
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:56,027
Thy lucid eyes with
velvet sheen o'er spread.

256
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,764
You find lines like
these in many English poems..

257
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:04,366
..where the loved one
is compared to flowers..

258
00:23:04,444 --> 00:23:07,538
..and her beauty, to the
various aspects of Nature.

259
00:23:08,448 --> 00:23:14,876
But this young man seems to
write with genuine feeling, l think.

260
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,927
Raj Lakshmi returns to
Kokatta and bring Binodini along.

261
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:37,067
ls this bungalow no.7?

262
00:23:45,485 --> 00:23:47,749
Which is no.7 then?

263
00:23:47,821 --> 00:23:49,482
Of which lane?

264
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:52,816
7, Darjipara Street.

265
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:55,417
No, this is no.10.

266
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:57,495
You speak English?

267
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:04,490
How long does it
take to learn English?

268
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,162
Depends on how much
you want to learn.

269
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,434
A white lady taught you English?
Weren't you scared?

270
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:13,772
More so when l found l
couldn't study after marriage.

271
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:22,111
My mother-in-law would disapprove
even if l studied in the afternoon.

272
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:26,612
She was right, so why blame her?

273
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,521
l guess you are right.

274
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,652
No one ever told you?
No one warned you?

275
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:33,621
About what?

276
00:24:34,064 --> 00:24:36,794
And my aunt says l'm a fool.

277
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:42,464
lf only she had met you
before you got married!

278
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:43,631
Aunt?

279
00:24:43,707 --> 00:24:46,642
My mother-in-law's sister-in-law.

280
00:24:47,678 --> 00:24:49,646
And if she had met me?

281
00:24:49,713 --> 00:24:52,807
She'd have stopped you from learning
English and you'd not be like this.

282
00:24:52,883 --> 00:24:58,150
No one seems to be there.
ls aunt Lakshmi sleeping?

283
00:24:58,221 --> 00:25:00,155
No, she is in her room.

284
00:25:03,894 --> 00:25:06,658
Go! - He's gone to
see my mother-in-law.

285
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,665
l was told that he comes straight
to you the minute he gets home.

286
00:25:13,904 --> 00:25:18,000
You thought that was him?
He's Behari. My brother-in-law.

287
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:34,857
l can't see his face.

288
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:39,688
lt's the dim light. Those creepers..

289
00:25:45,702 --> 00:25:50,537
That's no excuse. lt
is a south-facing room.

290
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:52,939
South facing rooms are
supposed to be airy and well lit.

291
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,602
Let me know when the
gardener comes tomorrow.

292
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,205
Don't do anything before
checking with him first.

293
00:25:59,282 --> 00:26:00,749
He has such a temper!

294
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,713
Doesn't look like it
from the photograph.

295
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,882
That's because he is posing
- All smiles.

296
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,226
One day Suddam bought tobacco leaves
for me to keep in the bookcase.

297
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:17,962
l somehow tucked them under
the pillow and went to sleep.

298
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,764
lt happened to be his
pillow and reeked of tobacco.

299
00:26:20,837 --> 00:26:23,738
He was furious, sulking all night.

300
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:27,971
Books too will reek with
the tobacco leaves in there.

301
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:31,641
Don't you have any naphthalene?
- What?

302
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,979
Tell you husband to get
you some naphthalene balls.

303
00:26:34,184 --> 00:26:37,642
lt's too difficult. You tell him.

304
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:39,248
Do you have pen and paper?

305
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:43,182
Will you be here for sometime?

306
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,590
As long as you don't throw me out.

307
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,254
lt will be such fun if you stay.

308
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,994
l can't read books in the cabinet.
You can read them out to me.

309
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:35,261
So, you were supposed
to be Behari's bride?

310
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,601
Yes.

311
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:41,338
Do you regret not
having married him?

312
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,271
Why should l?

313
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,212
God does everything for our good.

314
00:28:45,283 --> 00:28:46,614
ls that so?

315
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:50,780
l was widowed within a
year of marriage. For my good.

316
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:54,681
Really! l can't understand
why you had to learn English.

317
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,623
Otherwise, you'd be happily
living with your husband somewhere.

318
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,961
We wouldn't have met.

319
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,631
Or maybe l'd be here and
you'd be somewhere else.

320
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,830
How could that be?

321
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,808
You mother-in-law wanted me as a
bride for her son. Do you know that?

322
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,969
ls that so? Why didn't it happen?

323
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,146
You just said that God
does everything for our good.

324
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:26,990
l thought we'd be bosom friends.
lt's almost like we're co-wives.

325
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:54,986
lf l want a gift,
will you get it for me?

326
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:57,858
What?

327
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:00,729
You must buy it for me.

328
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:02,737
A necklace of ivory beads?

329
00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:04,996
l've written it down.

330
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:07,667
A shopping list?

331
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:09,176
l'll get it.

332
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:12,675
Naphthalene?

333
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:14,215
Will you get it for me?

334
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:16,075
Why suddenly?

335
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:21,748
So that the book cabinet will
not smell of tobacco leaves.

336
00:31:21,857 --> 00:31:23,347
Who told you?

337
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,020
Someone.

338
00:31:28,297 --> 00:31:29,764
Who wrote this?

339
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:31,094
The same person.

340
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,202
This isn't Behari's writing.

341
00:31:37,873 --> 00:31:40,706
You think that only
both of you know English?

342
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:45,103
l'd like to know who wrote this.

343
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:47,112
My best friend.

344
00:31:48,884 --> 00:31:50,215
When did she become your friend?

345
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:51,878
This evening.

346
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:54,113
The name?

347
00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:57,218
l can't give that away.

348
00:31:57,793 --> 00:32:00,887
Ok. The pet name then?

349
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:05,395
Choker Bali. (Sand in the Eye)

350
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:10,470
'There's the hand my trusted friend'

351
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:14,298
'And gives the hands on eye'

352
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,906
'Will take a cup of pines yet'

353
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:22,280
'For all lands eye'

354
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:27,088
'For all lands eye, My dear.'

355
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:30,751
'For all lands eye'

356
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:39,157
'For.. all.. lands.. eye.'

357
00:32:40,102 --> 00:32:41,262
Sister!

358
00:32:41,337 --> 00:32:44,932
Open the door! The
creepers have been cut.

359
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,781
Come in aunt Annapurna.

360
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:00,947
Aunt Lakshmi has a headache.

361
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:03,787
Mahendra isn't home. They
are cutting the creepers.

362
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:05,121
l told them to do so.

363
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:08,789
There's no sunlight in their room.

364
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:14,962
That's ok then. l thought
she didn't know about it.

365
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:23,138
ls the headache bad? Shall
l massage your forehead?

366
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:30,147
No, sister, sit here.

367
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,219
Shut the door, dear.

368
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:36,549
Tell them to stop fussing
over the trees being cut.

369
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:39,986
Some tea, sister.

370
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:41,393
Tea?
- Yes.

371
00:33:41,497 --> 00:33:44,489
Binodini has taught me
to drink afternoon tea.

372
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,992
With every sip, l think of you.

373
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,230
Not for me. l won't. You carry on.

374
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:57,438
No, l won't be the lone-outcaste.
lf l'm one, you go with me.

375
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:03,377
Whoever said that by
drinking tea you lose your caste?

376
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,184
Taste it aunt. Leave it,
if you don't like it.

377
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:19,865
Ugh!

378
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:34,039
lt tastes of basil-juice. Do
people actually hanker for this?

379
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:40,879
l quite like it. l felt a
little sinful at first but..

380
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:45,484
..she said and she's read a lot.
That the scriptures don't forbid it.

381
00:34:47,062 --> 00:34:50,896
l hear that the learned
Vidyasagar and our scriptures too..

382
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:55,062
..say that that even widow
remarriage is not a sin.

383
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:57,903
Yet, our young widows are still
made to observe rigid penance..

384
00:34:57,973 --> 00:34:59,998
..such as giving up fish
and meat. Widow's fast..

385
00:35:00,075 --> 00:35:02,908
Has this changed one bit?

386
00:35:03,412 --> 00:35:11,649
My English tutor said that a
sin is not a sin if you repent.

387
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:15,916
That's what the Christians say.
Will it hold for a Hindu's sin?

388
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:19,091
Each religion has it's own rules.
Since tea is a Christian thing..

389
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,595
..one must observe their tenets.

390
00:35:22,264 --> 00:35:25,324
Had your English lady
told you what penance is?

391
00:35:25,434 --> 00:35:30,337
Not penance, but remorse.
You confess your sin to God.

392
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:34,933
Holy mother! l'm a
Brahmin widow addicted to tea!

393
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,102
This is a grave sin!
God, forgive me!

394
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:40,942
Badi Maa!

395
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,108
That's Behari.

396
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:43,943
Wait a second.

397
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:46,110
Hide all this! Quick!

398
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:50,124
No need. Hand me the cup.
Aunt, open the door, please.

399
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:00,964
Do you know that they're
tearing down the creeper?

400
00:36:02,137 --> 00:36:03,502
Why?

401
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,970
You let them?

402
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:07,969
lt was becoming a jungle.

403
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:11,638
She said that trimming
it would make it neater.

404
00:36:12,981 --> 00:36:15,711
l'm told that she is
educated and she reads newspapers.

405
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:18,309
l assume she is not unaware
of Jagdish Bose's discovery..

406
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:20,321
..that plants are living things too.

407
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,650
That viewpoint
leads to other issues.

408
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:26,992
Why make widows stop
eating fish, our staple diet?

409
00:36:28,163 --> 00:36:29,994
Stop bickering, you two!

410
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:31,996
The tree is being trimmed.
lt will grow back again.

411
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:35,161
lt seems that Behari has
come prepared to say a lot.

412
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,005
l suggest that he be seated
and get it all off his chest.

413
00:36:43,512 --> 00:36:49,178
We can organize tea as well.
lf you want some, say so.

414
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:52,019
Very well, too.

415
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,021
Tea is a leaf too. lt has life.

416
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:58,021
Do you mind if we boil it?

417
00:37:06,568 --> 00:37:08,035
Your naphthalene.

418
00:37:08,303 --> 00:37:10,771
No, these are ivory beads.

419
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:13,538
Should l get them strung?

420
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:16,203
l knew you'd prefer the other.

421
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:20,215
Such pretty things. Why
hide them in bookcase?

422
00:37:23,051 --> 00:37:26,452
Looks tasty, like meringue balls.

423
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:30,048
Stop. They are poisonous.

424
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:33,554
Don't leave them around.

425
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:40,129
Do l keep them in this velvet?

426
00:37:40,202 --> 00:37:44,468
lf they stay in costly velvet,
where do l keep you?

427
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:47,565
What if insects bite
your honeydew skin?

428
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:50,134
Come. Try this on.

429
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,086
lt's what a white
woman wears! How can l?

430
00:37:59,421 --> 00:38:02,822
Women jump in to the
fire for their husbands

431
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,592
Won't you wear a
blouse to please me?

432
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:09,097
lf l dress like a white lady,
won't people snigger?

433
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:12,827
Don't wear it in public.
Wear it just for me.

434
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:17,832
Bali is also brave like you.

435
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:21,438
Both of you will make a lovely pair.

436
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,616
You can't always make me wear this.
l must learn to do it myself.

437
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:25,619
l can't sleep in this
clumsy thing all night!

438
00:40:25,687 --> 00:40:28,781
Your husband will
undo it anyway, Bali.

439
00:40:28,856 --> 00:40:30,517
Don't worry about that.

440
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:33,116
You are wicked, Bali.

441
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:36,630
Will you sew blouses like
this for my dolls, Bali dear?

442
00:40:36,698 --> 00:40:38,723
l'll practice on them
and learn to wear it.

443
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,531
Observe well and you'll learn.

444
00:40:42,603 --> 00:40:45,470
Take it off. l'll show you.

445
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:54,204
What's this? Bruised all over.

446
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:56,216
Tell me, how do l
cope with such a devil?

447
00:40:56,284 --> 00:41:02,154
lsn't he stronger than me?

448
00:41:02,223 --> 00:41:06,159
You need mental and
physical strength to say no, Bali.

449
00:41:06,227 --> 00:41:10,561
l told him to stop. He said
that even Gods are known to do it.

450
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:14,158
ln Kalidasa's book,
Lord Shiva gave Parvati..

451
00:41:14,235 --> 00:41:16,430
Enough, l mentioned
it for your own good.

452
00:41:16,504 --> 00:41:19,166
The day they turn septic,
your doctor husband..

453
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,902
..will also be not
able to heal them.

454
00:41:22,243 --> 00:41:25,440
Bali, please don't go. l
promise not to do it again.

455
00:41:25,513 --> 00:41:27,572
Just show me once again
how to wear this blouse.

456
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:29,445
You won't do it again? Promise?

457
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:30,916
l swear.

458
00:41:32,253 --> 00:41:37,691
Today's your first anniversary.
What if he forces you tonight?

459
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:40,250
l'll tell him, Bali forbids it.

460
00:41:40,328 --> 00:41:41,522
What?

461
00:41:41,596 --> 00:41:45,191
Oh no, what do l say then?

462
00:41:45,266 --> 00:41:47,598
Please tell me, Bali.

463
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:49,693
Close the door.

464
00:42:05,286 --> 00:42:09,552
Tell him it's inauspicious to remove
wedding clothes on an anniversary..

465
00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:11,956
..and l shan't take of this blouse.

466
00:42:15,563 --> 00:42:19,397
Did you see how it's worn?

467
00:42:20,835 --> 00:42:27,240
'ln anticipation of
their imminent meeting.'

468
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:49,255
'Radha sits wide eyed,
afraid to sleep.'

469
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:58,431
'She sits in the bower of bliss.'

470
00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:11,615
'But that dark one hasn't come yet.'

471
00:43:12,453 --> 00:43:15,286
What happened? Why
don't you close the door.

472
00:43:15,356 --> 00:43:17,950
Sorry, l cannot.

473
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:20,288
Why suddenly?

474
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:23,797
Bali will feel bad.

475
00:43:36,377 --> 00:43:40,905
'But that dark one hasn't come yet.'

476
00:43:40,982 --> 00:43:49,048
'hasn't come yet.'

477
00:43:50,391 --> 00:44:05,068
'But that dark one hasn't come yet.'

478
00:44:09,577 --> 00:44:20,010
'That rogue, the
wanderer of the woods'

479
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:31,093
'That Dark One hasn't come yet.'

480
00:44:36,771 --> 00:44:40,104
Consult the Almanac for
the time of the ritual.

481
00:44:41,776 --> 00:44:47,373
'lf that rogue shows
up at night's end.'

482
00:44:47,448 --> 00:45:01,385
'l'll tell him
you're late, go away.'

483
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:15,734
'The Dark One hasn't come yet.'

484
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:48,646
Bali, Bali!

485
00:45:48,715 --> 00:45:51,115
Where has that pot gone?

486
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:57,785
Ma'am.!

487
00:45:57,858 --> 00:46:01,521
You are being called
for the widow's ritual.

488
00:46:10,537 --> 00:46:12,801
Happy Dashera!

489
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,802
Greetings!

490
00:46:16,543 --> 00:46:18,534
l've two proposals.

491
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:23,811
One. We're submitting a
joint protest. Will you sign?

492
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:36,156
A protest in English
against the English?

493
00:46:36,563 --> 00:46:39,157
The British will not
understand if we protest in Bengali.

494
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:42,558
Read before you sign!

495
00:46:42,836 --> 00:46:47,000
There is nothing that you
can cheat out of a widow.

496
00:46:49,843 --> 00:46:51,834
You don't seem to have
covered many people!

497
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:53,573
Why?

498
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:56,514
There isn't one
signature of a woman.

499
00:46:56,683 --> 00:47:01,120
l did try. But most of
them can't sign their names

500
00:47:01,588 --> 00:47:05,183
Those who can are afraid.

501
00:47:05,258 --> 00:47:07,692
Of the British?

502
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:10,594
No, of their poor handwriting.

503
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:13,860
Proposal two is from Mahendra.

504
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:19,031
He has arranged for a picnic
this Saturday, in the garden-house.

505
00:47:20,874 --> 00:47:22,865
l won't go.

506
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:28,138
Better tell Mahendra yourself.

507
00:47:28,615 --> 00:47:32,551
Don't l have my own wishes?

508
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,282
Must l go by his?

509
00:47:37,624 --> 00:47:39,888
You can't have it all your way.

510
00:47:40,627 --> 00:47:44,723
You had the tree cut down.
That's your punishment.

511
00:49:02,636 --> 00:49:04,900
What should be the penalty
for cutting down the tree?

512
00:49:07,908 --> 00:49:11,173
For now, making tea for us.

513
00:49:12,646 --> 00:49:15,979
l've heard praises of
your tea from Behari.

514
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:22,583
No, Bali will not. She
gets no rest at home.

515
00:49:22,656 --> 00:49:24,851
She's here to enjoy herself.

516
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:26,654
Then why don't you make it?

517
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:32,995
Think l can't? Bali, sit here.
l'll call you if need be.

518
00:49:33,066 --> 00:49:36,263
'Salutations to the Motherland.'

519
00:49:38,672 --> 00:49:41,106
Have the swings been put up yet?

520
00:49:41,675 --> 00:49:44,269
Better tie Behari to the tree!

521
00:49:44,678 --> 00:49:49,342
Hearing the procession,
he will rush to join it.

522
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:56,788
l'm not such a spoilt sport yet.
Or l'd have opted out by now.

523
00:49:57,691 --> 00:50:00,353
Bipin Pal's meeting was
fixed for this morning

524
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:04,888
lnform me when Bipin Pal addresses a
meeting. l'll come along with you.

525
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:07,297
Bali, l told you not use
your husband's name in vain.

526
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:22,641
'At dawn we picked flowers happily.
Played the flute swinging carefree.'

527
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:33,251
'We sang beneath
the flowering tree.'

528
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:52,737
'Then all at once, one fine day.
Who knows, why we parted ways?

529
00:50:52,813 --> 00:51:02,188
'Should we meet again? Please stay.'

530
00:51:02,256 --> 00:51:03,689
Read anything new lately?

531
00:51:04,024 --> 00:51:06,015
Reading?

532
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,024
l barely scan the newspaper.

533
00:51:09,763 --> 00:51:12,425
Dear friend, l don't know
what it is to be a family man?

534
00:51:20,107 --> 00:51:22,439
The Taj Mahal has been sold.
Have you heard?

535
00:51:23,043 --> 00:51:25,034
lt was not sold.

536
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:31,217
The East lndia Company has
taken it over for a paltry sum.

537
00:51:33,053 --> 00:51:37,217
A man who loved his wife and
raised a monument in her honor..

538
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:40,055
..is a private affair.

539
00:51:40,794 --> 00:51:43,126
Must the Company acquire that too?

540
00:51:43,797 --> 00:51:45,731
What do you mean by private affair?

541
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:48,233
lf love is displayed
with such flamboyance..

542
00:51:48,302 --> 00:51:49,735
..it better be
preserved for posterity.

543
00:51:50,804 --> 00:51:54,399
The monument was falling apart.

544
00:51:54,474 --> 00:51:59,468
The Company has taken charge of it
to repair and maintain it properly.

545
00:52:00,013 --> 00:52:04,416
Behari, will you please come?
Your sister-in-law is calling you.

546
00:52:11,825 --> 00:52:14,259
Do you wrestle?

547
00:52:14,828 --> 00:52:16,022
No.

548
00:52:16,096 --> 00:52:17,757
Then do you exercise with dumbbells?

549
00:52:18,098 --> 00:52:23,092
Because his name is Behari,
must the poor man be a wrestler?

550
00:52:24,037 --> 00:52:29,100
Why? Ram Mohan Roy also
used to wrestle and exercise.

551
00:52:29,176 --> 00:52:31,167
He also stopped the evil
practice of the burning of widows.

552
00:52:31,244 --> 00:52:34,771
Behari, do something for
this damsel in distress.

553
00:52:34,848 --> 00:52:40,377
l am trying to do the same, Sister-in
-law wants me to pick lotus-blossoms.

554
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:43,787
ln the Mahabharata,
Draupadi had once asked Bhima..

555
00:52:43,857 --> 00:52:46,849
..to get a lotus with a fragrance
that carried a thousand miles.

556
00:52:46,927 --> 00:52:50,055
Now, that's the only social
reform yet to be legalized!

557
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,291
Polyandry!
- Woman allowed five husbands!

558
00:52:53,066 --> 00:52:55,125
The burning of widows
has been prevented.

559
00:52:55,202 --> 00:52:56,794
Widow remarriage is now permitted.

560
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,134
What remains is polyandry.

561
00:52:59,873 --> 00:53:03,206
Behari, take this
cause right up your sleeve!

562
00:53:03,276 --> 00:53:07,474
Without that you won't be
called 'Wrestler Behari'.

563
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,311
l know what he will be called.

564
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:16,151
Binodini's Behari.

565
00:53:33,106 --> 00:53:35,506
May l sit here, please?

566
00:53:35,909 --> 00:53:37,843
My pleasure.

567
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:43,508
Something in my foot.

568
00:53:45,919 --> 00:53:47,352
A thorn, l think.

569
00:53:47,421 --> 00:53:49,912
Let me see.

570
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:54,359
l'll manage. Please
don't touch my feet.

571
00:53:55,929 --> 00:54:00,366
One can touch feet out of
respect and also as a doctor.

572
00:54:00,434 --> 00:54:02,527
Allow me.

573
00:54:02,936 --> 00:54:07,270
A doctor has his fee, which
as a poor widow, l can't pay.

574
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:12,539
Heard of charitable dispensaries?
Quite common in villages.

575
00:54:12,946 --> 00:54:17,542
l have. But l don't accept charity.

576
00:54:18,118 --> 00:54:23,215
Pay me later. l'll be
here and so will you.

577
00:54:42,976 --> 00:54:46,571
Why didn't you go the pond?

578
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:51,244
Behari's juvenile antics
don't amuse me anymore.

579
00:54:51,384 --> 00:54:54,251
He's always showing off.

580
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:57,320
lt's not his fault.

581
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:01,918
Bali wanted them, so l asked him.

582
00:55:04,097 --> 00:55:10,661
Here's your thorn - A proof
that my treatment has ended.

583
00:55:14,007 --> 00:55:15,269
Thank you.

584
00:55:15,342 --> 00:55:19,278
Look Bali. Behari has
got so many flowers for me.

585
00:55:23,016 --> 00:55:24,950
lt's six months since you have come.

586
00:55:25,018 --> 00:55:27,543
This must be the first time that
you've stepped out of the house.

587
00:55:27,621 --> 00:55:29,111
Six months?

588
00:55:29,189 --> 00:55:31,623
lt was the fourth Monday of
the lunar month of Shravan.

589
00:55:35,028 --> 00:55:36,962
Really!

590
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:45,961
lts good to know that someone
cared to note my arrival details.

591
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:50,576
On that very day, a guest
moved in to stay with me.

592
00:55:50,644 --> 00:55:52,475
So l am able to remember.

593
00:55:55,048 --> 00:55:57,141
Man or woman?

594
00:55:59,052 --> 00:56:01,316
He's a seven-year-old.

595
00:56:09,062 --> 00:56:11,587
Won't you ever marry, Behari?

596
00:56:11,665 --> 00:56:13,155
Are you mad?

597
00:56:13,233 --> 00:56:15,497
Why, why do you call it madness?

598
00:56:15,569 --> 00:56:20,506
What if the wedding meals fall
short? Everyone will blame me.

599
00:56:20,574 --> 00:56:22,667
Don't invite anyone!

600
00:56:23,076 --> 00:56:26,341
How can the wedding be
held without witnesses?

601
00:56:27,347 --> 00:56:31,613
l'll be there as a witness.
l don't want a feast.

602
00:56:31,685 --> 00:56:34,745
Can l remove the swings?
lt's time to get back.

603
00:56:35,088 --> 00:56:42,620
'Who can ever forget the
memories of yesterday?'

604
00:56:42,696 --> 00:56:51,536
'We, like sand caught in the eye,
stayed glued, day after day.'

605
01:03:08,373 --> 01:03:11,433
Who'd say that the okra was tried to
perfection by this slip of a girl?

606
01:03:11,509 --> 01:03:15,206
The outer part green and fresh,
the inner crisp and crunchy.

607
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:20,714
ls that your
daughter-in-law's younger sister?

608
01:03:20,785 --> 01:03:24,653
Yes, that's Manorama. Quite
unlike her no-good sister..

609
01:03:24,723 --> 01:03:28,716
..who can't even fry potatoes!

610
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:31,057
They emerge soggy and damp,
not crisp as l do them.

611
01:03:31,129 --> 01:03:34,064
What doesn't she know?
For instance..

612
01:03:34,132 --> 01:03:36,566
..how to prepare the sweet dish
and food for offering in the rituals.

613
01:03:36,635 --> 01:03:39,729
How many priests must be fed
on the last day of the llu puja?

614
01:03:39,804 --> 01:03:43,240
Had she been to school,
she'd have graduated with honors.

615
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:45,070
Will you propose
her name to Behari..

616
01:03:45,143 --> 01:03:47,134
..and see if he is
interested in marrying her?

617
01:03:47,212 --> 01:03:50,477
l would have be overjoyed had he
mentioned about his own marriage.

618
01:03:50,548 --> 01:03:57,818
That's my worry. Who will look
after that bohemian when l die?

619
01:04:04,496 --> 01:04:06,589
Put some sugar on it. Quick!

620
01:04:06,665 --> 01:04:10,601
Of course, he'll marry. She will
have him under her spell in no time.

621
01:04:10,669 --> 01:04:12,432
No mothers-in-law, no sisters-in
-law. The way iss all clear.

622
01:04:12,504 --> 01:04:14,597
Tying a man to his
wife's sari is no big deal.

623
01:04:14,673 --> 01:04:17,267
Shall l book an
auspicious day next month?

624
01:04:17,342 --> 01:04:20,368
How will you change what's
in your fate, dear girl?

625
01:04:20,445 --> 01:04:25,610
Cut your finger or your heart.
Nothing will change.

626
01:04:27,452 --> 01:04:30,512
How did you cut yourself
so badly? The fish slicer?

627
01:04:30,588 --> 01:04:35,457
Are you a detective or a doctor?
Bali, ask Behari to come.

628
01:04:37,195 --> 01:04:39,186
l'm dressing it with tincture.

629
01:04:39,264 --> 01:04:43,132
lf you don't mind traveling
in the same carriage with me..

630
01:04:43,201 --> 01:04:45,726
..l'll take you to the hospital.

631
01:04:45,804 --> 01:04:52,141
Why must you escort her?
Why not consult Behari?

632
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:58,146
You two decide. Who'll be
her doctor? Behari or me?

633
01:04:58,216 --> 01:05:01,151
Your backache worries me. You
still can't manage the stairs.

634
01:05:01,219 --> 01:05:06,156
Your food is sent up.
You're missing college.

635
01:05:06,224 --> 01:05:08,749
How can you take
her to the hospital?

636
01:05:09,227 --> 01:05:11,661
Send for Behari. He'll
get here tomorrow morning.

637
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:16,166
Don't blame if gangrene sets in
and her arms have to be amputated.

638
01:05:16,234 --> 01:05:17,565
Don't worry, Mahendra.

639
01:05:17,635 --> 01:05:21,332
Women are tough. They
don't give in that easily.

640
01:05:21,406 --> 01:05:25,502
Tell me where the
hospital is. l'll go on my own.

641
01:05:25,577 --> 01:05:30,571
Bali's right. You
shouldn't strain your bad back.

642
01:05:30,648 --> 01:05:34,778
Dear Bali! l didn't mean that.

643
01:05:35,253 --> 01:05:37,915
How would l let you go alone?

644
01:05:39,524 --> 01:05:42,516
l didn't think that
it was that serious.

645
01:05:45,263 --> 01:05:49,529
Of course, he'll go with you.

646
01:05:49,601 --> 01:05:54,197
As a man, he should.
You better get ready!

647
01:05:57,375 --> 01:06:02,540
There is no flower.. no
fruits over there. Only..

648
01:06:02,614 --> 01:06:04,605
Who's going out so late at night?

649
01:06:04,682 --> 01:06:06,206
Sadhucharan!

650
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:16,554
Bali has cut her finger.
He took her to the hospital.

651
01:06:16,628 --> 01:06:18,391
Hospital, for a cut in the finger?

652
01:06:19,297 --> 01:06:23,233
lf infected, her arm may be cut off!

653
01:06:24,402 --> 01:06:26,393
You should have stopped them.

654
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:28,735
Why should l?

655
01:06:30,308 --> 01:06:33,436
Your husband likes
to fuss. That's why?

656
01:06:34,579 --> 01:06:38,413
Women often cut their
fingers and home remedies work.

657
01:06:38,483 --> 01:06:39,916
Did you call?

658
01:06:40,985 --> 01:06:42,577
Did he say when he'd be back?

659
01:06:45,423 --> 01:06:48,586
Sorry to keep you waiting.
We were at supper.

660
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,421
ls anything wrong?

661
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,587
Good evening, Dr.Graham.

662
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,864
Sorry to disturb you
at this late hour..

663
01:06:54,933 --> 01:06:57,493
..but this is an emergency.

664
01:06:57,602 --> 01:07:01,663
l see! ls she in trouble?

665
01:07:01,739 --> 01:07:03,434
l'm afraid so, doctor.

666
01:07:03,942 --> 01:07:06,274
There's been a terrible accident.

667
01:07:06,344 --> 01:07:07,868
ls she a relative?

668
01:07:08,012 --> 01:07:16,442
No. She is my wife's friend.
She's staying in our house.

669
01:07:17,355 --> 01:07:21,655
A serious matter. Then we
must deal with it at once.

670
01:07:21,793 --> 01:07:24,853
Yes, sir. We must act at once.

671
01:07:25,363 --> 01:07:28,628
All right. Let's proceed
without further delay.

672
01:07:29,367 --> 01:07:31,460
Please tell the lady to go inside.

673
01:07:31,536 --> 01:07:34,471
Tell her that there
is no need to be afraid.

674
01:07:34,539 --> 01:07:37,303
My wife will be there all the time.

675
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:38,637
Thank you, doctor.

676
01:07:39,377 --> 01:07:41,311
Anna, get the hot water ready.

677
01:07:42,814 --> 01:07:46,648
But first, l must ask
you a few questions.

678
01:07:49,387 --> 01:07:54,381
How many months ago
did this accident happen?

679
01:07:56,661 --> 01:08:00,392
Months? lt was just today.

680
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,937
l've just cut my hand. That's all.

681
01:08:08,406 --> 01:08:11,500
You must forgive my husband
for jumping to conclusions.

682
01:08:12,577 --> 01:08:16,843
But young widows in trouble coming
to us, is not so uncommon at all.

683
01:08:17,515 --> 01:08:20,507
But did the servant not explain?

684
01:08:20,585 --> 01:08:23,349
Yes, he did. But one
can never be sure.

685
01:08:24,422 --> 01:08:26,356
'Cutting the hand'
may just be a code word..

686
01:08:26,424 --> 01:08:28,358
..for something far more serious.

687
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:30,350
Meaning?

688
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:37,367
When a man-servant comes to us and
says a lady has a bad toothache..

689
01:08:38,436 --> 01:08:42,770
..we know now that it may
be a delivery case. - Oh no!

690
01:08:43,441 --> 01:08:46,774
Yes, indeed! So we
have to go prepared.

691
01:08:48,446 --> 01:08:52,542
lt took some time to get used
to all your roundabout rules

692
01:08:54,452 --> 01:08:56,113
But you should know about that.

693
01:08:57,555 --> 01:08:59,887
What did you say when
you had labor pains?

694
01:09:00,725 --> 01:09:05,059
Labor pains? Me? Never!

695
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:10,564
No children? l'm sorry.

696
01:09:13,471 --> 01:09:18,408
Then suddenly blossoms of
all kinds, so numerous, they..

697
01:09:18,476 --> 01:09:25,405
..could not easily be counted.
White, blood red, yellow, indigo.

698
01:09:26,484 --> 01:09:30,580
ln the forest, blossom hues
catch the eye from all sides.

699
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:32,579
Thank you, madam.
- You're welcome.

700
01:09:35,493 --> 01:09:36,926
Be careful with that hand.

701
01:09:36,995 --> 01:09:39,828
Don't worry, doctor. l'll make
sure she takes good care of it.

702
01:09:40,498 --> 01:09:41,931
Come on. Let's go now.

703
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,832
Thank you. Good night!

704
01:09:44,902 --> 01:09:47,166
Good night Doctor.
- Good-bye, young man.

705
01:09:47,772 --> 01:09:50,764
l would advise you to
take very good care indeed.

706
01:09:50,942 --> 01:09:53,877
We don't want any
more accidents, do we?

707
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:11,853
They just put ointment and a
bandage. This took so long?

708
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:17,060
Mahendra, they should
have amputated my hand.

709
01:10:17,135 --> 01:10:22,471
Then Bali would believe
the time was well spent.

710
01:10:28,813 --> 01:10:32,476
Bali, did l say that?

711
01:10:32,817 --> 01:10:35,479
What comes over you at times?

712
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:38,687
Can you eat with the injured
finger or shall l feed you?

713
01:10:40,558 --> 01:10:42,651
l don't fell like eating, Bali.

714
01:10:42,827 --> 01:10:43,987
You go and sleep.

715
01:10:58,576 --> 01:11:00,669
Tell me truthfully.

716
01:11:01,245 --> 01:11:02,507
What?

717
01:11:02,914 --> 01:11:06,907
Swear that you love me the most.

718
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:13,682
Meaning?

719
01:11:15,593 --> 01:11:19,029
That you love me more than your
medical profession, your studies,..

720
01:11:19,097 --> 01:11:23,534
.. your friends, more
than anything or anybody.

721
01:11:25,603 --> 01:11:30,165
l'd given you a magnet once.
Haven't seen it for a while.

722
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:32,940
Lost it, haven't you?

723
01:11:48,626 --> 01:11:49,888
Gentle lady..

724
01:11:50,061 --> 01:11:52,552
l'm so delighted to
receive your letter..

725
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:55,224
..which you sent through Maqbool.

726
01:11:56,634 --> 01:12:00,730
This letter reflects your maturity.

727
01:12:04,642 --> 01:12:06,906
Won't you close the door?

728
01:12:07,645 --> 01:12:11,308
You do it. My back's aching.

729
01:12:20,758 --> 01:12:24,751
Possible that you have
become too delicate in..

730
01:12:24,829 --> 01:12:26,763
..the constant company of books.

731
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:30,259
And thus you do not accept
my gentle and decent behaviour..

732
01:12:30,334 --> 01:12:32,268
..which is otherwise praised..

733
01:12:32,336 --> 01:12:35,100
..and you mock at it, however
l still cannot resist..

734
01:12:35,173 --> 01:12:39,337
..the temptation to
prove my gentlemanliness.

735
01:12:43,281 --> 01:12:47,274
You had said that you would visit
my place. lf this doesn't happen..

736
01:12:47,351 --> 01:12:52,118
..then not only will my
housse miss your arrival..

737
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:54,283
..but the test of my
decent and noble behaviour..

738
01:12:54,358 --> 01:12:56,121
..will also get
postponed indefinitely.

739
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:02,962
ls your back hurting a lot?
- Yes.

740
01:13:17,315 --> 01:13:20,648
Just let me know when
you want to visit me.

741
01:13:20,718 --> 01:13:24,313
My untidy, unruly
house is nonetheless mine.

742
01:13:24,822 --> 01:13:26,653
lt may not pass muster with
someone as accomplished..

743
01:13:26,724 --> 01:13:28,055
..in household chores as you.

744
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:30,059
Please give me prior intimidation.

745
01:13:30,127 --> 01:13:32,652
l look forward to the
pleasure of your visit.

746
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:35,324
Cordially, Behari.

747
01:13:47,745 --> 01:13:48,837
Mahendra.

748
01:13:49,747 --> 01:13:54,684
Your wife has suddenly sent an
urgent note calling us over.

749
01:13:55,353 --> 01:13:58,186
Any idea why this urgency?

750
01:14:04,862 --> 01:14:06,693
Why all this madness?

751
01:14:07,765 --> 01:14:09,198
Don't you like to dress up?

752
01:14:09,767 --> 01:14:11,200
No, l don't.

753
01:14:11,769 --> 01:14:13,361
l'm used to it now.

754
01:14:13,437 --> 01:14:16,201
But l like to dress you up.
You're not going out.

755
01:14:16,374 --> 01:14:18,433
Why not dress up a
little in private?

756
01:14:19,377 --> 01:14:21,368
Why should l do it in secret?

757
01:14:21,445 --> 01:14:23,037
Are jewels male that
touching them, is a sin?

758
01:14:23,114 --> 01:14:26,777
l'd like to give away this necklace.

759
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:30,046
My husband doesn't
like me wearing it.

760
01:14:30,121 --> 01:14:31,315
He gets angry, does he?

761
01:14:31,389 --> 01:14:33,880
This is Behari's wedding gift to me.

762
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:37,394
He doesn't object openly, but
it's clear that it upsets him.

763
01:14:37,528 --> 01:14:40,929
lf you must give it away,
why not to me, Bali?

764
01:14:41,065 --> 01:14:43,932
What will you do with it?
- l'll keep it safely.

765
01:14:44,068 --> 01:14:47,060
You have jewels
gifted to you by Mahendra.

766
01:14:48,072 --> 01:14:50,905
Let Behari's gift be with me.

767
01:14:51,142 --> 01:14:54,339
'Wearing garlands of flowers.'

768
01:14:54,412 --> 01:14:57,745
'Wearing blue veils.'

769
01:14:57,815 --> 01:15:01,808
'Red bridal powder
adorning the parting of the hair.'

770
01:15:01,886 --> 01:15:05,754
'Friend, take Radha along.'

771
01:15:05,823 --> 01:15:07,757
'Look who's coming..

772
01:15:07,825 --> 01:15:09,952
..on gentle feet,
Krishna approaches.'

773
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:11,927
'A voice gently singing..'

774
01:15:14,832 --> 01:15:19,166
l said to wait till l called for
you. Why did you come before calling?

775
01:15:19,236 --> 01:15:20,294
Amazing!

776
01:15:21,973 --> 01:15:24,100
You look beautiful in jewels.

777
01:15:24,942 --> 01:15:26,170
No, absolutely not.

778
01:15:26,844 --> 01:15:29,438
She looks lovely the way she is.

779
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:32,378
l presume this is your Bali's whim?

780
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:36,979
My own silly fancy
thinking you might appreciate it.

781
01:15:37,054 --> 01:15:39,284
Bali invited you both
for that reason alone.

782
01:15:39,357 --> 01:15:40,790
lsn't that so Bali?

783
01:15:40,858 --> 01:15:42,792
Your effort has won praise.

784
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:45,952
Behari's just said,
you look beautiful.

785
01:15:47,131 --> 01:15:48,962
l genuinely mean it.

786
01:15:49,133 --> 01:15:53,866
She looked beautiful so l said it.

787
01:15:53,938 --> 01:16:00,400
Admit though that
Mahendra's taste is more discerning.

788
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:06,815
l should have known that jewels
do not go with bandaged fingers.

789
01:16:06,884 --> 01:16:08,875
Are you angry with me?

790
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:12,148
Then l can't be frank with you.

791
01:16:18,162 --> 01:16:21,495
A widow removing her jewels,
is it a sign of anger?

792
01:16:21,565 --> 01:16:24,500
Bali, count these
carefully before putting them away.

793
01:16:25,903 --> 01:16:27,495
l'll leave and send the rest later.

794
01:16:31,909 --> 01:16:35,174
Have pity. You two are heartless!

795
01:16:37,381 --> 01:16:40,248
What has she got left in life?

796
01:16:40,317 --> 01:16:42,842
All she did was to
try on some ornaments.

797
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,251
You couldn't tolerate even that?

798
01:16:44,321 --> 01:16:45,583
You had her remove them right away.

799
01:16:47,925 --> 01:16:50,189
You could have said
that she looked lovely!

800
01:16:50,928 --> 01:16:55,194
ls this why you asked
for me? May l leave now?

801
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:07,268
You! Here?

802
01:17:08,045 --> 01:17:10,275
You can't ask that of a doctor.

803
01:17:10,347 --> 01:17:13,043
That bag doesn't look
like that of a doctor.

804
01:17:13,117 --> 01:17:15,278
Your friend has sent it.

805
01:17:15,953 --> 01:17:19,480
l'm the messenger.
You can't reproach me.

806
01:17:19,957 --> 01:17:24,894
You're irreproachable anyway.

807
01:17:24,962 --> 01:17:26,896
Who has the courage?

808
01:17:26,964 --> 01:17:28,488
l know of one.

809
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,392
Who?

810
01:17:30,968 --> 01:17:32,230
Why should l tell you?

811
01:17:32,636 --> 01:17:36,299
Does anyone give away
his own Elixir of Life?

812
01:17:37,241 --> 01:17:41,302
Why give it away? You
can always keep it safe.

813
01:17:41,445 --> 01:17:47,247
On one condition. The
Elixir remains in this box..

814
01:17:47,318 --> 01:17:49,912
..and the box stays with you.

815
01:17:51,322 --> 01:17:54,917
Then l will have to empty
the box of its contents.

816
01:17:55,326 --> 01:17:59,092
That's between you and your Bali.

817
01:18:01,098 --> 01:18:03,259
Our pact was that..

818
01:18:05,002 --> 01:18:10,099
..except this piece, l
won't touch any other.

819
01:18:18,282 --> 01:18:20,147
l don't accept that.

820
01:18:21,285 --> 01:18:25,949
lt's between the both of us.
Your views don't matter.

821
01:18:35,299 --> 01:18:36,960
Do they really don't matter?

822
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,371
The truth, Binodini.

823
01:18:47,311 --> 01:18:49,370
Please go to your room, Mahendra.

824
01:18:55,052 --> 01:18:56,986
What if l don't?

825
01:18:58,322 --> 01:19:00,984
Then call for a carriage,
hold my hand and..

826
01:19:01,058 --> 01:19:03,322
..take me for a walk by the Ganges.

827
01:19:11,068 --> 01:19:13,332
lsn't there a middle path?

828
01:19:15,406 --> 01:19:16,498
No.

829
01:19:17,074 --> 01:19:20,168
l beg you dear, don't be cruel.

830
01:19:21,512 --> 01:19:26,415
You're not, Asha. You don't
need constant explanations.

831
01:19:28,085 --> 01:19:31,179
lt's because l'm not Asha
that l detest compromise.

832
01:19:46,704 --> 01:19:50,640
You looked
ravishing in those jewels.

833
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:55,610
And without them?

834
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:14,056
Everyone has a pet name for you.
May l give you a name too?

835
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,231
Let's hear it first.

836
01:20:20,471 --> 01:20:21,733
My Elixir of Life.

837
01:20:56,273 --> 01:21:00,107
You know, my husband
died of tuberculosis.

838
01:21:09,453 --> 01:21:11,182
And you, a doctor!

839
01:21:15,292 --> 01:21:20,525
How many times have all of us,
Aunt, Bali, myself said..

840
01:21:21,298 --> 01:21:24,461
..spleen, spleen, spleen.

841
01:21:32,476 --> 01:21:42,647
'l gave in to love..'

842
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:49,489
..without end.'

843
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,894
'But why, my friend..

844
01:21:53,964 --> 01:22:00,494
..does my soul still weep?'

845
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:25,856
'Why does it still weep?'

846
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:47,382
'l gave in to love..'

847
01:22:47,451 --> 01:22:51,717
..without end.'

848
01:22:51,789 --> 01:22:57,728
'But why, my friend..

849
01:22:57,895 --> 01:23:09,238
..does my soul still weep?'

850
01:24:18,375 --> 01:24:19,808
Who's leaving at this hour?

851
01:24:19,977 --> 01:24:21,035
Sudama!

852
01:24:21,378 --> 01:24:24,472
Do people dare to leave the
house without informing you?

853
01:24:25,382 --> 01:24:28,943
lt could only be Mahendra.
He went to college hours ago.

854
01:24:29,386 --> 01:24:30,648
Who left just now?

855
01:24:30,721 --> 01:24:33,485
Madame Binodini has gone
to the Kalighat Temple.

856
01:24:33,724 --> 01:24:34,816
Alone?

857
01:24:34,892 --> 01:24:38,487
With Madame Asha perhaps.
Not in the room.

858
01:24:40,397 --> 01:24:45,528
Leaving without informing me?
Go look for her once again.

859
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:51,065
Had it been someone else, l would
have given the ornaments to her.

860
01:24:51,408 --> 01:24:52,841
How to spend so much money twice?

861
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:54,002
Now that my son is marrying
his wife's sister too..

862
01:24:54,077 --> 01:24:55,135
..what ornaments should l buy?

863
01:24:55,412 --> 01:24:57,676
Since they are sisters,
would it look right?

864
01:24:57,748 --> 01:25:01,548
Twice or ten times,
it's still a wedding.

865
01:25:01,618 --> 01:25:04,416
lt doesn't happen that nothing
new is given for the ceremony.

866
01:25:04,488 --> 01:25:09,357
People will gossip. Give her
'Firpo' bangles., They come cheap.

867
01:25:09,426 --> 01:25:11,758
Our goldsmith made them for
my daughter-in-law recently.

868
01:25:14,431 --> 01:25:15,762
You didn't go out then?

869
01:25:15,832 --> 01:25:17,857
l wondered if you'd dare.

870
01:25:18,435 --> 01:25:19,766
Where would l go?

871
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:22,532
l hear your friend has gone
to Kalighat Temple, alone.

872
01:25:22,606 --> 01:25:26,372
She went to pray on her
husband's death anniversary.

873
01:25:26,443 --> 01:25:32,439
She could have told me.
We could accompany her.

874
01:25:33,116 --> 01:25:35,778
Your daughter-in-law is
still looking very thin.

875
01:25:36,453 --> 01:25:38,580
No lack of milk and
cream in her diet.

876
01:25:38,655 --> 01:25:40,384
People will say l starve her.

877
01:25:41,725 --> 01:25:45,889
Bring your 'Firpo' bangles.
She wants to inspect them.

878
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:49,597
What's wrong? Lost them?

879
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:52,134
They're in the box.
l'll go and bring them.

880
01:26:55,532 --> 01:26:56,863
Dearest love.

881
01:26:57,534 --> 01:27:00,992
l've written seven letters to
you in the past three weeks.

882
01:27:02,139 --> 01:27:06,872
The proof is that all of
them are in my custody.

883
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:15,073
When a bride garlands her
husband on her wedding night..

884
01:27:15,218 --> 01:27:18,483
..she not only brings all her
inner emotions and aspirations..

885
01:27:18,555 --> 01:27:20,989
..and symbolically surrenders
them to her wedded husband.

886
01:27:21,058 --> 01:27:22,992
The flowers also imbibe the
fragrance of her emotions..

887
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:25,153
..to be imbibed by the
receiver of such affections.

888
01:27:25,562 --> 01:27:32,491
lf a scrupulously logical groom
decides to remove his garland..

889
01:27:32,569 --> 01:27:35,663
..the formal processes of marriage
do not suffer any aberration.

890
01:27:36,006 --> 01:27:37,496
Only the poor bride, radiant with..

891
01:27:37,574 --> 01:27:40,168
..the blossoms of her
first love, feels unrequited.

892
01:27:40,243 --> 01:27:44,009
And the flowers in her soul will be
like those on the discarded garland.

893
01:27:44,581 --> 01:27:47,516
You have been cautious in
returning my letters to me..

894
01:27:47,584 --> 01:27:51,179
..because you lack the courage
to face society and your wife.

895
01:27:51,254 --> 01:27:57,523
All these letters belong to you.
They adorn you and you alone.

896
01:27:57,594 --> 01:28:01,530
The rightful
adornments on Mahendra find a..

897
01:28:01,598 --> 01:28:05,534
..place of hiding in the
dark of my wooden jewel-case.

898
01:28:05,602 --> 01:28:10,539
l don't understand
why l guard these..

899
01:28:10,607 --> 01:28:15,544
..corpses of my emotions,
like an angel of doom?

900
01:28:15,612 --> 01:28:21,551
Even though l'm the creator of
these emotions and the letters..

901
01:28:21,618 --> 01:28:24,553
..l am not ready
to face this insult.

902
01:28:24,621 --> 01:28:27,556
The day that, on your own..

903
01:28:27,624 --> 01:28:31,560
..you accept my letters
with pride, courage and love..

904
01:28:31,628 --> 01:28:34,563
..maybe that day, l shall
start writing to you again.

905
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:36,555
Till then..

906
01:28:36,633 --> 01:28:38,567
..l release you from
this endless state of..

907
01:28:38,635 --> 01:28:42,071
..helplessness,
anxiety and indecisiveness.

908
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:46,575
Your Elixir of Life, Binodini.

909
01:28:54,651 --> 01:28:59,247
Wipe your forehead. lt's
smeared with vermilion.

910
01:29:06,263 --> 01:29:07,594
What's this?

911
01:29:08,665 --> 01:29:10,257
l rubbed it off.

912
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:15,600
Really, Binodini. How
do l go home like this?

913
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:18,601
You make love and
show no signs of it..

914
01:29:18,675 --> 01:29:20,609
..how's that possible?

915
01:29:21,945 --> 01:29:25,608
Take my case. l lived with
a man for barely a year.

916
01:29:25,682 --> 01:29:31,621
He's a ghost by now and l
still carry his mark on me.

917
01:29:35,959 --> 01:29:41,124
lf you don't want it
to show, cover it up.

918
01:29:47,971 --> 01:29:51,964
You still doubt my love for you?

919
01:29:52,976 --> 01:30:00,644
Not a bit. Can you come with
me just as you are, this moment?

920
01:30:01,718 --> 01:30:03,310
Where?

921
01:30:03,386 --> 01:30:06,651
That's not important. Can you?

922
01:30:12,729 --> 01:30:15,163
l didn't come prepared for that.

923
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:17,664
Not prepared? Meaning?

924
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:28,341
lf only you had told me earlier..

925
01:30:28,411 --> 01:30:30,003
What would you have done?

926
01:30:32,015 --> 01:30:36,679
Haven't l sent you a
carriage so we could meet in secret?

927
01:30:36,753 --> 01:30:39,187
Haven't l met you
during college hours?

928
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:45,688
Rub that off.

929
01:30:52,769 --> 01:30:57,706
l went to Kalighat and bought
a basket of offerings for you..

930
01:30:57,774 --> 01:31:01,710
..so that you
wouldn't be caught out.

931
01:31:01,778 --> 01:31:05,714
You told them you were going
to the temple, didn't you?

932
01:31:07,784 --> 01:31:15,714
Yes, saying it was my
husband's death anniversary..

933
01:31:15,792 --> 01:31:19,728
..the first time l've gained
anything from being a widow.

934
01:31:25,402 --> 01:31:28,735
Why so long? You'll be gray by
the time you bring those bangles.

935
01:31:29,806 --> 01:31:31,740
l've kept the neighbor waiting..

936
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:35,744
What's the matter?

937
01:31:48,825 --> 01:31:50,759
Tell me, dear.

938
01:31:51,094 --> 01:31:52,755
Nothing, mother.

939
01:31:57,233 --> 01:31:59,224
You can't hide
anything from a mother.

940
01:32:00,837 --> 01:32:02,771
What is it?

941
01:32:06,376 --> 01:32:11,780
l beg you, Mother! Beat me, kill
me, but don't ask me to explain.

942
01:32:12,849 --> 01:32:14,783
l will not be able
to tell you anything.

943
01:32:19,856 --> 01:32:21,118
You wretched girl..

944
01:32:21,191 --> 01:32:23,785
..this little area of the
bed is what is your space is.

945
01:32:25,862 --> 01:32:27,796
You couldn't even hold on to that?

946
01:32:31,468 --> 01:32:34,130
Aunt , offerings from Kalighat.
Have some.

947
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:40,473
What's the matter,
Bali, why are you crying?

948
01:32:40,877 --> 01:32:43,812
Forgive me, Bali. Mother
wanted to see the bangles..

949
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:47,145
..so l opened your jewel-case.

950
01:32:47,217 --> 01:32:48,809
lt's not my fault.

951
01:32:57,894 --> 01:32:59,828
My revered husband..

952
01:33:00,363 --> 01:33:04,823
l've fought hard with myself
to come to this final decision.

953
01:33:05,969 --> 01:33:11,168
Believe me, no one besides
God has helped me in this.

954
01:33:13,443 --> 01:33:19,848
l'm uneducated, don't know English,
l am unskilled at house keeping.

955
01:33:21,918 --> 01:33:26,184
At first, all this was a cause
of shame to me in our house.

956
01:33:28,391 --> 01:33:34,523
lt was your love and encouragement
that helped me set that shame aside.

957
01:33:37,934 --> 01:33:41,870
l grew used to you
being my talisman.

958
01:33:44,207 --> 01:33:51,875
l cannot share you with another.

959
01:33:54,384 --> 01:33:57,876
lf someone worthier
has won your heart..

960
01:33:58,421 --> 01:34:04,883
..she has done so on her own merit.
l have no ill feeling towards her.

961
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:10,893
All my ornaments were
worn to please your eyes.

962
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:17,235
They hold no value for
me when you are not there.

963
01:34:19,442 --> 01:34:23,572
l've put my
jewel-case in Bali's room..

964
01:34:25,048 --> 01:34:30,509
..with confidence in
her sympathy and care.

965
01:34:32,055 --> 01:34:36,583
Aunt says that we get
alarmed over minor setbacks.

966
01:34:36,993 --> 01:34:42,260
To the Supreme Being,
the future is transparent.

967
01:34:45,068 --> 01:34:52,941
Since we do not know the future,
we should leave it in His hands.

968
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,941
May the Lord bless you.

969
01:34:59,015 --> 01:35:03,281
May he keep you
well in body and mind.

970
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:09,959
With deep respect, Ashalata.

971
01:35:25,804 --> 01:35:27,328
Close the door.

972
01:35:41,687 --> 01:35:43,348
Tea with ginger or without?

973
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:47,017
Why did Asha leave for Kashi?

974
01:35:47,693 --> 01:35:49,888
Didn't she tell you?

975
01:35:49,962 --> 01:35:52,362
l'm asking you. Answer me!

976
01:35:54,433 --> 01:35:57,368
lt's not your
concern what she told me.

977
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,374
Where's your rosary?

978
01:36:04,443 --> 01:36:06,377
l removed it.
- Why?

979
01:36:06,712 --> 01:36:09,044
To make it easier to fool around?

980
01:36:12,451 --> 01:36:16,046
lf you want to
discuss this, come outside.

981
01:36:16,722 --> 01:36:19,714
l don't like
backbiting behind closed doors.

982
01:36:20,459 --> 01:36:25,795
Where l gossip, back bite or shit
in my house, is for me to decide!

983
01:36:25,931 --> 01:36:28,058
Low-lying snake! Look how
she raises her head to strike!

984
01:36:29,067 --> 01:36:31,399
l'm not ready to strike yet, aunt.

985
01:36:32,471 --> 01:36:34,405
Don't force me.

986
01:36:34,473 --> 01:36:38,409
What more can you poison?
Think you can hurt me further?

987
01:36:38,477 --> 01:36:39,739
Let's see how!

988
01:36:39,811 --> 01:36:41,403
l haven't consciously harmed
anyone. l've never sinned.

989
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,742
Did not commit any injustice.

990
01:36:42,814 --> 01:36:45,078
Your tea is still in your cup.

991
01:36:45,751 --> 01:36:48,413
Let's not talk of sin and virtue.

992
01:36:48,754 --> 01:36:53,418
You slut! By giving me tea once
a day, you think you control me?

993
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:56,753
Greedy witch! You came to
a mansion from a mud hut..

994
01:36:56,828 --> 01:37:00,093
..and you think
yourself to be a princess!

995
01:37:00,766 --> 01:37:04,429
lf l was that avaricious,
your daughter-in-law..

996
01:37:04,503 --> 01:37:08,439
..l would have left
this house long back.

997
01:37:08,507 --> 01:37:10,441
Think l don't know
what you're after?

998
01:37:10,509 --> 01:37:13,910
You have desires
that can ruin families.

999
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:17,447
My son is the same.

1000
01:37:17,516 --> 01:37:20,451
He chose his wife, but that
did not stop his promiscuity.

1001
01:37:20,519 --> 01:37:25,115
ls only physical desire
a sin? ls gluttony not?

1002
01:37:25,524 --> 01:37:30,791
As a pious widow, why this
need for tea every evening?

1003
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:34,121
Two cups of tea can spur
you to say such things?

1004
01:37:35,534 --> 01:37:39,470
Take your tea back.
l'll vomit all of it.

1005
01:37:48,547 --> 01:37:51,482
Madam, what happened?
Are you feeling sick?

1006
01:37:55,954 --> 01:37:57,478
Move.

1007
01:38:07,566 --> 01:38:09,500
Mother, what happened?

1008
01:38:09,568 --> 01:38:11,502
What's wrong with you?

1009
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:14,495
Mahendra, today before sunset..

1010
01:38:14,573 --> 01:38:21,502
..either that slut
leaves the house or l do.

1011
01:38:22,581 --> 01:38:24,515
You decide within an hour.

1012
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:35,856
Tell her that there is
no need to wait that long.

1013
01:38:36,595 --> 01:38:39,530
l won't use your carriage.

1014
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,534
Please send someone to hire one.

1015
01:38:48,607 --> 01:38:50,541
Does a person
called Behari live here?

1016
01:38:53,612 --> 01:38:55,546
Come in.

1017
01:39:02,621 --> 01:39:04,555
You have made elaborate
security arrangements.

1018
01:39:05,223 --> 01:39:06,884
ls it due to the fear
of the white police?

1019
01:39:07,092 --> 01:39:11,552
Could be. Even the white
police can't beat his English.

1020
01:39:12,898 --> 01:39:15,230
A relative?

1021
01:39:15,767 --> 01:39:18,099
He's the same guest l
told you of at the picnic.

1022
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:23,904
Basanta, come here.

1023
01:39:29,648 --> 01:39:31,582
Show her how to greet a lady.

1024
01:39:35,253 --> 01:39:37,585
She wants to know how
good you are in English.

1025
01:39:42,127 --> 01:39:44,118
Call me aunt, okay.

1026
01:39:47,933 --> 01:39:49,594
White. Black.

1027
01:39:49,668 --> 01:39:52,603
You really know your English.

1028
01:39:54,139 --> 01:39:57,597
Tell me what is 'Hide and Seek'.

1029
01:39:58,143 --> 01:39:59,610
''Luka-Chhupi'

1030
01:39:59,945 --> 01:40:01,606
Very good.

1031
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:05,613
Shall we play 'Hide and Seek'?

1032
01:40:08,687 --> 01:40:10,621
Where will you hide?

1033
01:40:10,956 --> 01:40:13,618
l'll hide and then call out to you.

1034
01:40:30,709 --> 01:40:32,643
What's this?

1035
01:40:33,712 --> 01:40:38,172
Didn't you say that l looked
good in jewels the other day?

1036
01:40:38,717 --> 01:40:42,050
You look beautiful today as well.

1037
01:40:43,722 --> 01:40:45,656
There's just one problem.

1038
01:40:47,192 --> 01:40:51,652
Tell me when you wish to leave.
l'll call a trusted coachman.

1039
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:55,188
lf l say, no need for the coach.

1040
01:40:56,735 --> 01:40:58,669
That l will spend the night here.

1041
01:40:59,738 --> 01:41:01,672
Tell me that well in advance.

1042
01:41:03,341 --> 01:41:05,400
l'll find another place to stay.

1043
01:41:08,346 --> 01:41:09,677
Why, Behari?

1044
01:41:10,749 --> 01:41:14,150
You are a cultured, modern doctor.

1045
01:41:15,153 --> 01:41:17,417
You handle men and
women's bodies regularly.

1046
01:41:17,756 --> 01:41:23,217
They are sick men and women. l'd
rather not think of you as sick.

1047
01:41:28,033 --> 01:41:30,365
Basanta is ready. He's calling you.

1048
01:41:32,771 --> 01:41:34,705
And you?

1049
01:41:36,775 --> 01:41:40,370
l'm not playing hide
and seek with you.

1050
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:46,046
That's not why l am here either.

1051
01:41:47,786 --> 01:41:49,720
l came here to speak frankly.

1052
01:41:52,057 --> 01:41:54,457
Will you marry me?

1053
01:42:06,805 --> 01:42:10,070
How do l make you
believe me? What should l do?

1054
01:42:11,476 --> 01:42:16,470
Careful, this is a bachelor's room.
Most things are untouchable here.

1055
01:42:16,815 --> 01:42:24,745
Joke, tease, and make fun of me
all you want, but some other time.

1056
01:42:25,824 --> 01:42:27,758
Please do me this favor.

1057
01:42:30,829 --> 01:42:33,229
l have come here to seek shelter.

1058
01:42:34,165 --> 01:42:35,757
Why?

1059
01:42:36,301 --> 01:42:38,292
l thought, you were doing
fine being sheltered there.

1060
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:46,775
There's no recognition in
that shelter. No respect.

1061
01:42:47,846 --> 01:42:50,110
l heard a different story.

1062
01:42:51,249 --> 01:42:53,240
lt's the respect you got there..

1063
01:42:53,318 --> 01:42:56,776
..that made Asha leave her
shelter and leave for Kashi.

1064
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:06,797
You give me shelter now and..

1065
01:43:06,865 --> 01:43:13,134
..l'll see that Asha's respect
and recognition is restored to her.

1066
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:19,333
You admit that you had
a hand in removing it?

1067
01:43:19,878 --> 01:43:21,812
You don't have to love me.

1068
01:43:23,882 --> 01:43:25,816
You can go on loving Bali.

1069
01:43:26,885 --> 01:43:32,221
You want her happiness, surely?

1070
01:43:34,893 --> 01:43:39,830
lf l move away from Mahendra,
Asha can get her husband back.

1071
01:43:39,898 --> 01:43:41,832
There are many types of love.

1072
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:45,162
l'm not sure which one
you are referring to.

1073
01:43:46,905 --> 01:43:50,170
But l believe, love
has no exchange value.

1074
01:43:50,909 --> 01:43:54,174
l've been hiding for so long.

1075
01:43:54,446 --> 01:43:59,440
Coming! l am talking. Let me finish.

1076
01:44:00,919 --> 01:44:02,853
Go. Open the door.

1077
01:44:02,921 --> 01:44:07,858
Tell me, do you refuse me
just because l'm a widow?

1078
01:44:10,395 --> 01:44:11,862
You tell me first.

1079
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:14,862
Do you want me just
because l'm unmarried?

1080
01:44:18,937 --> 01:44:20,871
Please listen!

1081
01:44:22,474 --> 01:44:23,873
l could be your maid.

1082
01:44:28,947 --> 01:44:31,211
l hate seeing you demean yourself,
sister-in-law.

1083
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:35,215
Don't you dare
call me sister-in-law!

1084
01:44:36,554 --> 01:44:37,885
Okay.

1085
01:44:40,959 --> 01:44:43,223
l'll call you Madam Binodini.

1086
01:44:44,963 --> 01:44:46,897
But l still stand by my point.

1087
01:44:51,970 --> 01:44:55,906
There's no courage in
acting like Vivekananda.

1088
01:44:56,975 --> 01:44:59,910
lf you must, go
stay at the monastery.

1089
01:45:00,979 --> 01:45:02,913
Don't turn towards family life

1090
01:45:03,982 --> 01:45:08,248
l've no virtues to be Vivekananda.
l'm an ordinary person.

1091
01:45:08,987 --> 01:45:11,922
Rejecting a destitute young woman..

1092
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:14,254
..is neither ordinary nor otherwise.

1093
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:17,655
lt's called impotence.

1094
01:45:27,005 --> 01:45:29,269
This viciousness doesn't befit you.

1095
01:45:30,008 --> 01:45:32,670
Cool down. Go home.

1096
01:45:38,016 --> 01:45:39,950
Can we talk tomorrow morning?

1097
01:45:41,286 --> 01:45:45,279
l'll not leave until you establish
your right as a man and a ruler.

1098
01:45:45,356 --> 01:45:46,948
l dare you!

1099
01:45:48,026 --> 01:45:49,960
Ruler is a bad word, Binodini.

1100
01:45:50,462 --> 01:45:52,953
The whole country is struggling
for freedom from the British Rule.

1101
01:45:53,298 --> 01:45:56,631
A country's struggle and a
widow's struggle are not the same

1102
01:46:00,305 --> 01:46:04,503
l've gone through a lot of
mental turmoil before coming here.

1103
01:46:05,043 --> 01:46:06,977
Take me!

1104
01:46:13,651 --> 01:46:18,611
lf you don't wish to see
my face, close your eyes.

1105
01:46:23,061 --> 01:46:25,154
l won't mind.

1106
01:46:34,072 --> 01:46:36,666
You and l had
lovely moments to share.

1107
01:46:41,079 --> 01:46:43,013
Why did you ruin it all at once?

1108
01:47:20,118 --> 01:47:21,608
What's the matter?

1109
01:47:25,390 --> 01:47:28,223
He didn't greet you like a lady..

1110
01:47:28,293 --> 01:47:30,056
..so you're crying?

1111
01:47:42,473 --> 01:47:44,634
Respected Behari.

1112
01:47:45,476 --> 01:47:47,410
Your ready praise..

1113
01:47:47,478 --> 01:47:50,572
..when you saw jewels
adorning this widow's body..

1114
01:47:50,648 --> 01:47:53,139
..gave me courage.

1115
01:47:53,585 --> 01:48:04,257
l don't know when my
courage turned to daring..

1116
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:11,426
Bringing this hopeless
creature before you.

1117
01:48:11,603 --> 01:48:16,097
ln searching for the
source of that courage..

1118
01:48:16,174 --> 01:48:18,438
..l kept making mistakes.

1119
01:48:19,177 --> 01:48:23,511
ln coming to you, l hoped that
for once l had judged correctly.

1120
01:48:24,182 --> 01:48:27,276
l am sad that this
experience displeased you.

1121
01:48:29,187 --> 01:48:32,452
l have three
identities in our society..

1122
01:48:32,523 --> 01:48:36,653
..that of a widow, an
English-educated and a young woman.

1123
01:48:39,631 --> 01:48:44,295
These three have
eclipsed my real identity.

1124
01:48:46,204 --> 01:48:52,632
Society does not see that a
young woman, educated and a widow..

1125
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:56,202
..is also flesh and blood.

1126
01:48:57,215 --> 01:49:03,154
Today, l have no shame in
acknowledging this fourth identity..

1127
01:49:03,221 --> 01:49:06,315
..spurred by the
courage l see in you.

1128
01:49:17,735 --> 01:49:21,831
..can lay claim to your sympathy.

1129
01:49:25,343 --> 01:49:29,370
l have forsaken the first
two traits of widow and lady.

1130
01:49:30,448 --> 01:49:33,576
Or l would wait an
eternity for you..

1131
01:49:33,651 --> 01:49:36,586
..at the Kashi riverbanks.

1132
01:49:39,524 --> 01:49:42,687
l hope you keep well.

1133
01:49:43,528 --> 01:49:46,554
For me, there
remains a widow's destiny..

1134
01:49:46,798 --> 01:49:55,604
..one that neither you nor
your Jagadish Bose have noted.

1135
01:49:56,607 --> 01:49:59,599
And probably for the best.

1136
01:49:59,944 --> 01:50:02,879
Now all will return to normal.

1137
01:50:05,383 --> 01:50:07,613
l know you are an atheist.

1138
01:50:08,553 --> 01:50:13,217
Even so, if you ever
believe in a great truth..

1139
01:50:13,291 --> 01:50:17,227
..please pray that
in some other life..

1140
01:50:17,295 --> 01:50:22,733
..l may be reborn as a
companion suitable for you!

1141
01:50:22,967 --> 01:50:29,896
ln hope of forgiveness, Binodini.

1142
01:50:59,937 --> 01:51:10,677
'Life, dear Life, don't
go away and leave me.'

1143
01:51:12,617 --> 01:51:18,453
'lf you go away from me, Life..'

1144
01:51:18,623 --> 01:51:24,789
'..who will love me?
You tell me, Life!'

1145
01:51:45,817 --> 01:51:46,909
You?

1146
01:51:49,654 --> 01:51:50,712
Let's go.

1147
01:51:51,722 --> 01:51:52,814
Where?

1148
01:51:53,057 --> 01:51:54,490
Wherever you were going.

1149
01:51:54,559 --> 01:51:56,720
That day when you walked out,
with barely nothing on you..

1150
01:51:56,794 --> 01:51:58,489
..l thought you had won.

1151
01:51:59,397 --> 01:52:01,388
But l will also not give up.

1152
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:04,730
l'm just a couple of days late.

1153
01:52:05,937 --> 01:52:08,531
l want to go to Behari.

1154
01:52:08,673 --> 01:52:11,335
You want him as a witness?

1155
01:52:13,678 --> 01:52:16,078
No, l want you as a witness.

1156
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:20,549
Will you request him on my behalf?

1157
01:52:20,852 --> 01:52:24,344
l know he will not refuse you.

1158
01:52:24,689 --> 01:52:25,747
Meaning?

1159
01:52:34,699 --> 01:52:40,035
Fasting won't help
your anger. Come eat.

1160
01:52:40,104 --> 01:52:41,571
No need.

1161
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:46,570
Let my clothes dry. l'll
leave by the next train.

1162
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:53,778
Turning away from the doorstep
of a home brings bad luck to it.

1163
01:52:56,721 --> 01:52:58,552
Come in, at least.

1164
01:52:59,557 --> 01:53:02,117
Allow me to welcome
and serve my guest.

1165
01:53:21,812 --> 01:53:23,746
Will you really serve me?

1166
01:53:29,487 --> 01:53:31,421
You'll not turn away the guest?

1167
01:53:40,231 --> 01:53:42,426
That's my marriage bed.

1168
01:53:46,604 --> 01:53:48,936
He died here.

1169
01:53:59,517 --> 01:54:01,951
There's no proper bathroom here.

1170
01:54:03,521 --> 01:54:06,115
Can you wash near the well?

1171
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:14,054
Behari has gone away.

1172
01:54:15,533 --> 01:54:19,993
He left a boy named
Basanta in mother's care.

1173
01:54:21,639 --> 01:54:24,631
Then l know where he has gone.

1174
01:54:27,545 --> 01:54:29,479
He has gone to Kashi

1175
01:54:29,647 --> 01:54:33,640
Why? Because Asha is there?

1176
01:54:34,819 --> 01:54:35,877
No.

1177
01:54:36,554 --> 01:54:38,988
Because l'm meant to be there.

1178
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:42,154
That's what l wrote to him.

1179
01:54:43,561 --> 01:54:47,156
Will you take me to him?
Promise me you will.

1180
01:54:53,838 --> 01:54:54,896
l promise.

1181
01:54:55,573 --> 01:54:58,508
You must protect me
the entire journey.

1182
01:55:02,246 --> 01:55:07,240
Don't fear any advances from me.

1183
01:55:07,585 --> 01:55:10,713
l could be weaker than you.

1184
01:55:11,689 --> 01:55:13,520
You must stop me then.

1185
01:55:14,191 --> 01:55:15,715
l'll try.

1186
01:55:16,594 --> 01:55:19,256
What is the guarantee that
you'll keep your promise?

1187
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:24,090
What guarantee do you want?

1188
01:55:24,168 --> 01:55:29,697
Tell me, where did you get the
strength to make this promise?

1189
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:34,202
Do you want the truth?

1190
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:37,713
This is a prize for good conduct.

1191
01:55:43,154 --> 01:55:45,884
You love this body.
Don't you, Mahendra?

1192
01:55:48,893 --> 01:55:50,554
Don't you know that?

1193
01:55:53,731 --> 01:55:57,064
lf l poison myself, my
body will be dissected.

1194
01:55:57,134 --> 01:55:59,728
You won't like that.

1195
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:07,070
Eat.

1196
01:56:07,645 --> 01:56:10,307
God has blessed you.

1197
01:56:10,648 --> 01:56:16,644
lnform your mother-in-law.
Tell her you are pregnant.

1198
01:56:17,655 --> 01:56:19,247
l'll become a mother!

1199
01:56:20,658 --> 01:56:23,752
What am l to do with
this innocent one?

1200
01:56:23,928 --> 01:56:28,331
Please give up your vow
and start eating fish again.

1201
01:56:28,933 --> 01:56:30,924
That will be a sin, aunt.

1202
01:56:31,001 --> 01:56:34,767
lt's a bigger sin if you don't
feed it to the one in your womb.

1203
01:56:37,942 --> 01:56:39,102
Come here.

1204
01:56:42,947 --> 01:56:45,211
Can we sneak in a little fish?

1205
01:56:45,416 --> 01:56:57,795
'Life, dear Life, don't
go away and leave me.'

1206
01:56:59,029 --> 01:57:05,298
'lf you go away from me, Life..'

1207
01:57:05,436 --> 01:57:11,841
'..who will love me?
You tell me, Life! '

1208
01:57:14,245 --> 01:57:26,817
'Life, dear Life, don't
go away and leave me.'

1209
01:57:27,324 --> 01:57:31,158
'lf you go away from me, Life..'

1210
01:57:31,395 --> 01:57:39,666
'..who will love me?
You tell me, Life! '

1211
01:57:46,744 --> 01:58:04,686
'Oh! My beloved beckons me
and the river is in between.'

1212
01:58:18,776 --> 01:58:21,370
lf you were a man, you could
well be a prince driven by lust.

1213
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:24,714
That requires courage.

1214
01:58:24,782 --> 01:58:27,216
Perhaps l would, because
of the courage within me.

1215
01:58:27,284 --> 01:58:30,219
Why accuse me of cowardice?

1216
01:58:30,788 --> 01:58:36,727
l left my wife, mother, even
my home to be here with you.

1217
01:58:36,794 --> 01:58:38,887
You insist that l lack courage!

1218
01:58:39,797 --> 01:58:43,733
You didn't leave her Mahendra,
it is she who left you.

1219
01:58:44,802 --> 01:58:47,794
lf she had retained her
status in your house..

1220
01:58:47,872 --> 01:58:51,740
..you wouldn't be here living with
me on the banks of the river Ganga.

1221
01:58:51,809 --> 01:58:55,905
You know that very well.

1222
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:59,245
You also know, deep within your heart,
that if she returns to you now..

1223
01:58:59,316 --> 01:59:02,752
..you'll discard me this second,
here, in the middle of this river.

1224
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:05,254
You will have to live with her.

1225
01:59:09,827 --> 01:59:14,924
Let's go in. lt's chilly
and you'll catch a cold.

1226
01:59:19,036 --> 01:59:23,439
You asked if l wanted anything.

1227
01:59:23,841 --> 01:59:26,776
A vendor came selling
shawls in that household.

1228
01:59:27,111 --> 01:59:33,448
He had a red one that l liked.
Will you buy it for me?

1229
01:59:34,852 --> 01:59:37,787
You'll wear red (the
color of fertility)

1230
01:59:37,855 --> 01:59:41,951
l have the courage to wear red.
lf you don't, l won't wear it.

1231
01:59:42,059 --> 01:59:45,790
l'll buy it, but remember..

1232
01:59:45,863 --> 01:59:50,197
..if Behari sees you in it,
he also won't approve.

1233
01:59:57,875 --> 02:00:01,208
You wasted money,
paying for this houseboat.

1234
02:00:01,879 --> 02:00:05,542
l can still go back. Shall l?

1235
02:00:05,883 --> 02:00:08,010
Don't regret it later.

1236
02:00:08,085 --> 02:00:10,485
You made me promise.

1237
02:00:10,888 --> 02:00:15,325
Otherwise, this moment you
seem an object of desire to me.

1238
02:00:15,392 --> 02:00:16,882
Nothing more.

1239
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:24,834
Now..

1240
02:00:24,902 --> 02:00:27,166
..you seem quite the
lust driven prince.

1241
02:01:06,210 --> 02:01:07,871
What's wrong, Binodini?

1242
02:01:11,949 --> 02:01:13,940
What happened?

1243
02:01:22,292 --> 02:01:24,624
Don't you want a child?

1244
02:01:31,969 --> 02:01:33,960
l know that you do.

1245
02:01:34,972 --> 02:01:37,566
You made me promise.

1246
02:01:39,977 --> 02:01:44,243
Or would l deny you anything?

1247
02:02:22,286 --> 02:02:24,015
What's happened?

1248
02:02:24,088 --> 02:02:28,957
She yearned to be here
and give herself to God.

1249
02:02:29,026 --> 02:02:31,290
Lord Vishwanath kept her wish.

1250
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:36,124
ls she dead? How did they know?

1251
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,566
She lay in that state all week.

1252
02:02:38,635 --> 02:02:43,629
The herbal doctor said so. Yet
they've sent for a physician.

1253
02:03:12,069 --> 02:03:14,003
Where's Mahendra?

1254
02:03:14,071 --> 02:03:16,062
Haven't you come for me?

1255
02:03:18,075 --> 02:03:20,066
Aunt passed away.

1256
02:03:22,079 --> 02:03:24,206
Where is Mahendra?

1257
02:03:27,084 --> 02:03:29,416
When the end was near,
she kept saying.

1258
02:03:29,486 --> 02:03:31,511
Observe a widow's feast as
part of my funeral rites.

1259
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:37,083
People feed priests,
give offerings to cows..

1260
02:03:37,161 --> 02:03:42,360
..to crows, to jackals, even trees.

1261
02:03:43,367 --> 02:03:45,767
But no offerings
are made for widows.

1262
02:03:47,104 --> 02:03:49,368
Conduct the rituals for the widows.

1263
02:03:54,444 --> 02:03:57,208
Has Bhabhi been informed?

1264
02:04:01,118 --> 02:04:03,052
Yes.

1265
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:06,055
l came here to give her the news.

1266
02:04:07,324 --> 02:04:09,383
l met her by the riverbank.

1267
02:04:16,133 --> 02:04:17,725
Are you planning to go home?

1268
02:04:18,135 --> 02:04:19,796
Yes, he will.

1269
02:04:20,137 --> 02:04:22,071
Go.

1270
02:04:22,139 --> 02:04:24,573
l've packed your things.

1271
02:04:25,142 --> 02:04:29,738
At the funeral, place some
tea among the offerings.

1272
02:04:30,147 --> 02:04:32,741
She was very fond of it.

1273
02:04:37,154 --> 02:04:40,089
Talk to the priest about Bali.

1274
02:04:40,157 --> 02:04:42,421
She shouldn't follow the
discipline for these 1 1 days.

1275
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:45,594
Talk to the Brahmin regarding this.

1276
02:04:46,330 --> 02:04:50,426
Give her some money as well.
- l don't understand.

1277
02:04:51,168 --> 02:04:54,831
Thank you for keeping
your promise, Mahendra.

1278
02:04:55,372 --> 02:04:59,706
l don't think l'll ever be able
to pay your fees in this life.

1279
02:05:04,181 --> 02:05:07,844
Why? Won't we meet again?

1280
02:05:10,187 --> 02:05:15,853
Even if we do, we shouldn't
try to settle old accounts.

1281
02:05:47,224 --> 02:05:51,661
Aunt said that there was a
marriage proposal for me..

1282
02:05:51,728 --> 02:05:54,219
..which you broke off.

1283
02:05:57,234 --> 02:05:59,225
l may have.

1284
02:06:00,304 --> 02:06:02,329
There ought to be a
punishment for that.

1285
02:06:05,242 --> 02:06:10,509
l will plead in the court.

1286
02:06:11,448 --> 02:06:14,246
Why will the judge
melt upon seeing you.

1287
02:06:14,318 --> 02:06:16,684
Any special reason to think this?

1288
02:06:17,521 --> 02:06:19,682
Let him fine me then.

1289
02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:23,590
And if the fine is to be paid..
l'll work as a maid in his home.

1290
02:06:24,528 --> 02:06:29,192
What if l lay down
another punishment?

1291
02:06:30,867 --> 02:06:34,200
No penalty is new for a widow.

1292
02:06:36,273 --> 02:06:41,210
The punishment l want to
propose would be new, l assure you.

1293
02:06:41,678 --> 02:06:43,270
What is the punishment?

1294
02:06:46,283 --> 02:06:48,376
You will have to marry me.

1295
02:06:58,628 --> 02:07:01,222
ls that a release bond
for your sister-in-law?

1296
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:06,235
No, just like that.

1297
02:07:08,572 --> 02:07:10,563
You fix a date.

1298
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:12,733
l'm ready.

1299
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:35,321
Open up.

1300
02:07:36,333 --> 02:07:39,268
Open up or the
punishment will be more severe.

1301
02:09:14,431 --> 02:09:16,422
Badi Maa would say that..

1302
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:19,367
..in a place of pilgrimage,
everyday is auspicious.

1303
02:09:21,438 --> 02:09:23,429
l'll come tomorrow morning.

1304
02:09:30,714 --> 02:09:32,705
Be ready.

1305
02:10:35,111 --> 02:10:38,774
l'm running away fearing that
the wedding feast may fall short.

1306
02:10:38,848 --> 02:10:40,782
This letter is for Bali.

1307
02:10:40,850 --> 02:10:43,114
Please give it to her.

1308
02:10:43,186 --> 02:10:45,620
Begging your forgiveness, Binodini.

1309
02:10:50,527 --> 02:10:52,518
My dear friend, Bali.

1310
02:10:53,063 --> 02:10:56,965
There are differences on the
surface between the two of us.

1311
02:10:57,033 --> 02:10:58,864
Still, we became bosom friends.

1312
02:10:58,935 --> 02:11:03,201
We were happy at Darjipara street.

1313
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:05,531
That was our small universe.

1314
02:11:05,609 --> 02:11:09,136
This was our universe.
Call it our village.

1315
02:11:09,713 --> 02:11:12,876
Sharing our lives despite
our superficial differences..

1316
02:11:12,949 --> 02:11:15,816
..is not new to the
history of our country.

1317
02:11:15,885 --> 02:11:18,820
Hence we didn't do
anything new, Bali.

1318
02:11:18,888 --> 02:11:22,483
Does that mean that we
had no inner connection?

1319
02:11:22,559 --> 02:11:23,753
We did.

1320
02:11:23,827 --> 02:11:25,488
We both wanted to have
families of our own.

1321
02:11:25,562 --> 02:11:28,554
As l said, we hadn't
seen nothing of the world..

1322
02:11:28,632 --> 02:11:31,567
..outside the inner
quarters of Darjipara street.

1323
02:11:31,635 --> 02:11:34,103
Within those walls, we tried to
meet our desire for a family life..

1324
02:11:34,170 --> 02:11:36,695
..with the one man
who ruled our world.

1325
02:11:37,574 --> 02:11:39,906
And without success.

1326
02:11:39,976 --> 02:11:43,173
lt shattered our tiny world.

1327
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:46,572
lf Lord Curzon's law
comes into force..

1328
02:11:46,650 --> 02:11:52,111
..you and l would live in
not one country but two.

1329
02:11:52,188 --> 02:11:54,588
Residing in those two countries,
if we brood on the insults we bore..

1330
02:11:54,658 --> 02:11:58,594
..the disappointments we faced,
then we have lost the battle..

1331
02:11:58,662 --> 02:12:02,063
..before it has started!

1332
02:12:02,198 --> 02:12:05,258
Bali, our country is
within our hearts.

1333
02:12:05,702 --> 02:12:12,540
lf there is a link between us, if
you believe in the vow we took..

1334
02:12:12,609 --> 02:12:19,538
'Earth below, heaven above,
forever we'll promise to love.'

1335
02:12:19,616 --> 02:12:24,553
..then what can
Lord Curzon do to us?

1336
02:12:24,721 --> 02:12:28,157
The day l left Darjipara
Street and came to Kashi

1337
02:12:28,224 --> 02:12:32,718
..that's when l first realized
what a country really means.

1338
02:12:32,962 --> 02:12:36,557
Till then, l had
only read in books..

1339
02:12:36,633 --> 02:12:39,727
..of a world beyond the kitchen,
courtyard, shutters..

1340
02:12:39,803 --> 02:12:42,237
..and petty rules of home life.

1341
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:44,630
l thought it was all fantasy.

1342
02:12:44,708 --> 02:12:47,575
The Mahabharat tells us,
how Abhimanyu..

1343
02:12:47,644 --> 02:12:50,841
..became a great warrior
inside his mother's womb.

1344
02:12:50,914 --> 02:12:55,783
The child in your womb bathed
daily in the Ganges with you.

1345
02:12:55,852 --> 02:13:00,084
l urge you, Bali,
whether boy or girl..

1346
02:13:00,156 --> 02:13:03,922
..don't cage it within that
two-storeyed Darjipara Street house!

1347
02:13:03,993 --> 02:13:09,192
Your child one day will show
you what a country really means.

1348
02:13:09,265 --> 02:13:11,597
Ever yours, Choker Bali.

1349
02:13:11,668 --> 02:13:14,262
She left no address?

1350
02:13:16,673 --> 02:13:24,944
No, l asked in her
village and searched in Kashi

1351
02:13:26,850 --> 02:13:31,617
Could she have left Kashi
after writing so much about it?

1352
02:13:31,688 --> 02:13:36,022
She didn't write about Kashi.
She wrote about the country.

1353
02:13:40,296 --> 02:13:45,791
Maybe she has found some
other lndia and has gone there.

1354
02:13:52,709 --> 02:13:54,700
Will have to go a bit early today.

1355
02:13:54,778 --> 02:13:57,246
lf l do not start now,
the meeting will start.

1356
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:05,051
Are you off?

1357
02:14:05,121 --> 02:14:09,387
l'll leave early today,
Mahendra. The meeting will start.

1358
02:14:14,731 --> 02:14:18,667
Be careful! lt's not
that safe outside.

1359
