1
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,753
All right Mr. Raju, congratulations...
for your release

2
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,249
Jailer sir, thank you
so much

3
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:37,265
Raju, look over there-

4
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:51,406
Your city, your house, your life,
your happiness, your memories.

5
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,683
Mother, quickly serve food for me,
I am feeling very hungry

6
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,620
What's this, eat properly like
humans, first go freshen up

7
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:03,454
Mother, the vehicle is coming

8
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,626
The vehicles will keep coming
and going-

9
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,456
Come lets see how fast this taxi
takes us to the station?

10
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,697
Are you going to think about
the shop or not? -

11
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,295
You've given it in the hands
of the boy he"ll ruin it

12
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,135
Poor father, toiled and died after
leaving a shop for his son-

13
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,137
And he is head over heels
of becoming a Guide

14
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:20,305
Mother from Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay,
Madras, Singapore, London, Rome & Hongkong

15
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,640
Any tourist after getting down at
the station, what he asks is

16
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,584
Where is Raju guide, where is...
I am coming...

17
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,315
Mother, its for
Gafoor

18
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,481
Raju, again...

19
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,721
Enough. Enough. Enough...

20
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,995
Friend, the throat of the car will
get choked, here take your share

21
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,502
Come on my love
take us fast

22
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:56,342
Sir, eat this betel, the nuts are from
Mysore & the leaf is from Calcutta-

23
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,211
The catechu is of Bombay, and
the calcium is of Bikaner

24
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,019
It doesn't look like a betel leaf
looks like National Unity

25
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,553
Raju listen, you extract a lot
of work from my son-

26
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,190
And you pay him
very less salary

27
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,189
I give him Rs 10 he will not
get a penny from outside-

28
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,691
Instead I should get some
thing from you

29
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,194
That I have provided your vagabond
son on a job.

30
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:13,293
I see...

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,196
s

32
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,201
Raju sir, now a days people
purchase very less-

33
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,203
But they ask more for the
address of Raju Guide

34
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,205
Dilip, my dear, there is a lot
for you to learn from life

35
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,380
You must be wondering that leaving
all those beautiful places-

36
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,548
Why have I brought
you all here?

37
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,714
The Poets wrote poetry on
the streets of Paris

38
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,546
They fell in love on the bylanes
of Rome & Venice

39
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:38,554
Poet Zauk has even said-who will go
leaving the streets of Delhi-

40
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,434
Wow! What a beautiful
thing it is

41
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,762
Brother, now come here
with me

42
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:25,494
Come let's go

43
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,102
I'll show you an
excellent thing

44
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:27,773
Show me

45
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,167
Look at this, each and every part of
this is made of a different stone

46
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,106
Touch it and see

47
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,946
Great, Wonderful, what an
excellent workmanship

48
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,947
Raju, think once again

49
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,792
The same city, which oneday bowed
before you

50
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,326
Should not ridicule
you today

51
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,988
The same streets, where you
roamed like a King

52
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,129
Today, those shouldn't think you
to be a robber

53
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:03,469
Mother, Uncle, Rosy, friends, you made
everyone shed tears in their hearts

54
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,644
And then today, you have been
released from the Jail

55
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,483
There is nothing other than
insults in this city

56
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,981
Leave this city, lf you can settle
settle your life somewhere else

57
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:54,963
Greetings

58
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,103
After so many years, the fortune of
this temple has blossomed

59
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:09,838
What's the name of
this village?

60
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,281
The name of the village is Rampuri
and my name is Bhola

61
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,281
Where have you come from and
where will you go from here?

62
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,623
Friend, coming and going is not
always in our hands

63
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,955
A person thinks, I'll
go that side

64
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,790
But the destiny catches him by his
ears and drags him that side

65
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,793
He thinks, I'll go that side, but
the nose drags him to that side

66
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,129
Your words are irrevocable

67
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,631
After getting fed up, one day I
called the destiny near me

68
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,636
And asked, afterall, what
exactly do you want?

69
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:36,330
I see...

70
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,303
She said, leave your will and
catch hold of my finger & come

71
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,306
I said, alright
as you please

72
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,639
So brother look, today I am here
tomorrow there

73
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,483
Don't know where I'll be
day after tomorrow

74
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,880
Very true, very true

75
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,986
Standing near the bank of the river
I was thinking

76
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,484
That, I give up my life, by jumping into the river

77
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,990
Then suddenly
I saw you

78
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,321
And I heard Bhola whatever
said and done

79
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,827
The God has sent this nobleman
after listening to your cries

80
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,501
Friend, right now, I don't have a
penny, which I can gave you

81
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,895
But yes, you can take this cloth
If it can help you in any way

82
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,505
You are a very generous person
but my worry is of something else

83
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,004
Noble man, I am in
a great difficulty

84
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,181
They say, difficulty and life go
hand in hand till the pyre

85
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,007
Very true

86
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,180
But the entire fault
is of my father's

87
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:23,016
Yes, my father
married thrice

88
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,523
I was born to the first wife

89
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,851
A totally mentally retarded boy
was born to the second wife

90
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,193
A girl was born to the third wife

91
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,386
Not a girl, she was the root
cause for all the difficulty

92
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,857
Well, whatever it may be, a sister
is anyway a sister

93
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:36,032
Only God knows, how I
brought her up

94
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,036
But in return she...

95
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,704
Does she refuse for her
marriage?

96
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,367
Look... I had searched a
very good groom for her

97
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,710
But the day, when I fixed
her marriage

98
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,042
Do you know
what she did?

99
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,076
She ran off from
the house

100
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,712
Ran off

101
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,748
What is concealed from you, for 4 days
I kept searching her empty stomach

102
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,553
And I found her very far
in a fair

103
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,215
And now, she remains, closed
in a room

104
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,755
Neither she eats, drinks nor
talks to anybody

105
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,820
She keeps crying, crying
and crying

106
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,628
I am preplexed, my wife is preplexed
the entire village is preplexed

107
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,394
If she dies tell me who'll be
responsible for that sin?

108
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,068
Friend, well what
can I do?

109
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,299
Lord, there is a lot of force
in the advice of Saints

110
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,901
Once if you...

111
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,408
Alright, bring her here, probably
this Saintliness plays some miracle

112
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,511
Greetings, greetings

113
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,920
Lord, I have brought some
fruits for you

114
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,787
She wasn't coming, I said a great
nobleman has come

115
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,431
He'll fulfil all
your desires

116
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,997
She has come in the greed
to have your glimpse

117
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,601
Bhola, there was a time, when I
had totally lost faith on Humanity

118
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,537
My heart used to cry & the
entire world looked as an enemy

119
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,471
But there is no cloud, which
will not get scattered

120
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,110
There is no sorrow, which
has no remedy

121
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:57,611
Lord's magic

122
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:02,777
This earth, this sky, this air
that mountain, this temple, me, you...

123
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,456
Everybody are Lord's magical
play isn't it?

124
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,122
Yes may be

125
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,618
But Maya, the fact is that the love
which one can get from her husband

126
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,562
Can't be got from 100 step brother's
or even from 500 step sisters-in-law

127
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,471
Did I say a lie?
- No

128
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:24,165
Then take this, eat thinking it
to be the divine offering

129
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,645
God will bless you
God will bless you

130
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,250
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!

131
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,827
Lord, lord, lord, this is a small
gift for you, please accept it

132
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,164
Brother, what's
this for?

133
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,532
Lord, even after knowing everything
you are still being sarcastic

134
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,345
I have fixed even her
marriage date

135
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,179
Maya's marriage, has
she agreed?

136
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,546
Come come... come come...

137
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,214
Lord!

138
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:18,688
Why have you
stayed back?

139
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,701
You yourself come and request
Lord to stay back till the marriage

140
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,301
Felt shy...

141
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,381
There is no doubt, that he
is some Great Soul

142
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,380
Who has come here for the
betterment of this village

143
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:46,388
What nonsense are you talking
are Great Soul's carrot's or a raddish's

144
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,059
Which can grow in
all the farms?

145
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,660
The wisdom of these illitrates
have gone to dogs

146
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,898
Listen to what
we say

147
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:57,395
It's a great sin to consider any
Tom, Dick & Harry as Lord

148
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,730
The Lords have a
character

149
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:05,241
It can be understood only by those
who have full knowledge of scriptures

150
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,949
Thank you, thank you, I thank you my
village thanks you

151
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,247
Bhola, again the
same thing

152
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,253
No body should touch his feet
he doesn't like it

153
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,425
Alright, alright...

154
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,687
Come... come... come fast...

155
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,433
What's all this drama? What lies
have you spread about me?

156
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:36,267
Lord, I haven't told anything, I
haven't spoken a word

157
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,933
But tell me, when the sun rises
can anybody hide it's rays?

158
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,277
Come... come... move
make way...

159
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,118
Vacate the place
for the Lord-

160
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,318
What are you doing? Simply
standing over here?

161
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,783
Blow the fan...

162
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:55,286
Is there anyone, listen go send
the girl, let her take the blessings

163
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,188
Why are you all marching forward?
Be patient, be patient

164
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,729
You must have heard that
native Doctor's are created falsely

165
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,633
Have you ever heard, that even
Lord's are created falsely?

166
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,298
Do you go to school?

167
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,806
There is no school
in the village

168
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,680
Priest, carry your divine vessel, and
march forward towards the forest

169
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,648
Priest, what are you saying
come with me?

170
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:30,150
Let us, the knowledgable person's
also go on a Holy pilgrimage

171
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,330
Lord live long...
- live long

172
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,328
What good name did you
say was his?

173
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,501
Priest sir, what will you do
after listening to the name?

174
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,502
Haven't you heard don't ask the
caste of a Sage, ask for his wisdom

175
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,334
Value the sword, and
not the scabbard

176
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,509
Wow! Great, excellent...

177
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,711
Keep quiet, we have come here only to
enquire about your knowledge

178
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,516
But, please be seated

179
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,185
When great people like
you are standing-

180
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,718
Then how can this worthless
dare to sit

181
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,014
Wow! Great...

182
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,723
You have obtained a good education
priest, sit down

183
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,690
I'll arrange an another
cot for you to sit-

184
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,523
This is Lord's place
Bhola, don't act like a fool

185
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,530
First, know who deserves the
respect and who doesn't?

186
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,074
Lord, give us the meaning
of this Hymn?

187
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,715
Why couldn't understand?

188
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,549
He can understand, only when he
knows sanskrit, isn't it?

189
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,557
Excellent!

190
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:47,737
Priest, you didn't understand

191
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,071
Teacher, you? No

192
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,410
How can you? You can understand
only if you know English, isn't it?

193
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,145
Lord

194
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:58,907
'Live long'

195
00:16:59,284 --> 00:16:59,909
Lord

196
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:00,585
'Live long'

197
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:01,578
Lord

198
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:02,082
'Live long'

199
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,760
Greetings mother

200
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,937
Welcome... Miss Nalini, today what
made you come here?

201
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,937
Today it's the day for Raju to
get released from the Jail

202
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,242
I suppose, even his mother
has come for that

203
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,274
Greetings mother

204
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:28,370
Greetings

205
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,941
It's been months, since he
has been released

206
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,945
But how is this possible that Raju's
imprisonment was reduced by 6 months

207
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,556
Oh yes! You had gone
to London

208
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,958
But, How didn't he meet
you till now?

209
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,627
I returned only today from the
village, greetings

210
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:51,302
Greetings

211
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,533
So, was your trip to
Europe succesful?

212
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:57,973
There was a lot of news about
it in the papers-

213
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,140
When did you return, please come
in have a cup of tea

214
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:02,981
Please permit me to go

215
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,308
Mother... mother... l'll not
let you go by walk

216
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,646
Rosy, move away
leave me

217
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,983
If you don't listen to me, I'll catch
your feet, infront of everybody

218
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,159
What drama are
you playing?

219
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,822
Then please come
come...

220
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:25,998
Several times, I had tried to come
you & voice my sorrows

221
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:34,012
And to make you realise, that I am
not that as bad as you think

222
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,181
I don't want any
explanation

223
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:41,015
How can I forget, that I had
only one son in the entire world

224
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,188
But the moment, your shadow
was cast him

225
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:44,679
Neither, he remained mine
nor of the world

226
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,194
I fail to understand

227
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,286
That, when you were not determined to
stay with your husband

228
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,361
Then, why did you
get married?

229
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,192
Why did I marry?

230
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,263
Do you want to
know?

231
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:04,700
Then listen

232
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,704
My mother was
a prostitute

233
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,210
She had only one ambition
in her life

234
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,547
That somehow she wanted to keep her
daughter away from that atmosphere

235
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:19,724
Whether, I went to
school or college

236
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,889
I always stayed
in a Hostel

237
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,027
But still, I couldn't kept
myself away from dancing

238
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,396
Get out from
my house

239
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:36,063
Lakshmi Bai, I'll go but drainage
water can never become Holy water

240
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:36,570
Get out

241
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:39,801
Mother, what's the matter?

242
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:40,407
Nothing

243
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,419
Aunty, what's the matter
tell me...

244
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,412
I had brought a
message for you

245
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,586
One Banwarilal, was ready to give
Rs 2000 PM for you

246
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,256
And your mother is out
of her brains

247
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:01,597
Look at this

248
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,760
But mother, I don't want to
get married right now

249
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,267
I want to earn a name by
dancing on the stage

250
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,506
The one, who doesn't have her
father's & husband's name

251
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,609
And whose mother
has a ill-fame

252
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,272
Under what name can that
girl acheive fame?

253
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,611
Daughter, once you get away
from this atmosphere

254
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,619
Get married to some
respected person

255
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,115
Then, whatever you do, nobody
will dare to raise a finger on you

256
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,630
I like your daughter

257
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,561
Then have sweets

258
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,969
Even you take

259
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:55,809
Mr & Mrs Marco, I happily acknowledge
this consent of your's

260
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,315
And legally register your
marriage

261
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:04,658
Mr. Marco, congratulations

262
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:05,563
Thank you

263
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,552
There is a difference in my house
and in your mother's house

264
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,391
Do I have to make you
understand this?

265
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:16,332
Mother...

266
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:20,233
Mother...

267
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:21,635
Daughter...

268
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,079
Daughter, what's
the matter?

269
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,915
Mother, now what can I
make you understand?

270
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,821
Just think, there will be no child
born in this house

271
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,399
Sir, listen you seem
to be a local

272
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,228
Yes

273
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,272
Can you tell me where can I get the
address of Raju guide?

274
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,532
Why not? You can ask any child
passenger, porter

275
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,800
Instead, I tell you to ask it
from the engine of the train

276
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,778
Sir, I am asking you

277
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:01,874
Who are you?

278
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:02,938
How does it
concern you?

279
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,046
If you are asking a decent man
then ask decently

280
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,784
Have I asked you to
interfere in between?

281
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,722
Let the guide go to hell, I can
carry on the work even without guide

282
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,285
You can carry on, but
what about me?

283
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,683
I know, you are coming with me
you would become a burden

284
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:16,951
If you know, then why did
you bring me along with you?

285
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,624
I did a mistake, I did
one more mistake

286
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,628
Writing a letter to this bloody
guide was a total fiasco

287
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,967
You... are you
Mr. Marco?

288
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,066
How does it
concern you?

289
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:27,796
How did you come to know
my name?

290
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,031
I beg an apology
I am Raju Guide

291
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,743
I should have recognised you
after seeing you itself

292
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,212
Well tell me, have the arrangements
for the Hotel been made? -yes

293
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,147
And taxi?

294
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,313
Taxi is also arranged, Porter

295
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:44,319
Mr. Bearer

296
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:45,982
What's this?

297
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,662
If anything breaks again, I'll
adjust the cost from your pay

298
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,165
Go go go...

299
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,170
I had written to you that the
purpose of my visit here

300
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,504
To search the ancient caves

301
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,341
Do you see the dak-bungalow
on that hillock?

302
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:11,879
Yes

303
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,678
Behind that in the jungle are the
caves that you're looking for

304
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,358
Alright I'll freshen up & go

305
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,356
Right now its impossible -

306
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,426
It'll be night fall when we reach
there and then how'll we return?

307
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,094
To go there, one has
to go early morning

308
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,022
That means today is wasted

309
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,360
Sir, what's this, if a day gets
wasted then why am I a Guide?

310
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,537
Here there are beautiful
places to watch

311
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:36,195
I've no time to waste I've
come to see only the caves

312
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,205
You are forgetting that
I'm also with you

313
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,880
And I may be interested in
them besides the caves

314
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,884
Is there any good
library here?

315
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:47,380
Yes it is there

316
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,383
Then drop me there &
show the town to Madam

317
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,389
Madam won't go alone
- What?

318
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,391
If I was fond of going alone
on excursion -

319
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,582
I would'nt have come with you

320
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,053
But Rosy you know...

321
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,887
If you won't come with me then
I won't go

322
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,062
Why does man get married?

323
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,069
That means you don't care
about me at all

324
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,578
Think that way, I don't care
I don't care...

325
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,080
I am going

326
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,086
Coming Madam

327
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,427
Show the town to Madam

328
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,096
Mr. Marco won't come

329
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,427
Shall I write & give you that
he won't come

330
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,938
Gafoor, show the town to Madam
- Yes sir

331
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,441
Where should I go first?

332
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,271
Go to hell, but go

333
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,944
If they had to go to hell why
people would come to Udaipur?

334
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,446
We think this place
is heaven

335
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,120
You're right, Raju, but
keep quiet at the moment

336
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,966
This is the library of
our town

337
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,965
Stop the car only when you
are told to

338
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,068
Understood Gaffoor?

339
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,632
Yes, I understood but
you keep quiet

340
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,465
But I didn't understand

341
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,002
If you're such a tourist who doesn't
want a guide to talk -

342
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,645
Then, here is the car, Gaffoor
& this person

343
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:24,473
Is going...

344
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:25,983
Listen...

345
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,816
Is there any hamlet of
snake charmers?

346
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,990
Where the lady snake charmer does
snake dance

347
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,400
lt'll be better if Mr. Marco doesn't
know about this

348
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,068
He wouldn't
know

349
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,574
If you didn't come with me then why
should I come with you

350
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,744
Don't come

351
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,410
Then go

352
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,445
Yes I am going

353
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:59,089
Go

354
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,415
Where to?
- To see the caves, where else?

355
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,426
You'll go alone?! - Why?

356
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:05,592
Is it the custom there?

357
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,422
That without the wife man is not
allowed to go in

358
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,760
It could be late night when you
return and she is alone...

359
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,096
So? When she doesn't want to
come what can I do?

360
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:29,612
What was that?

361
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,119
What happened?

362
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,952
The jungle is getting very
dangerous, animals come inside

363
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,792
Open the room & get the
food prepared

364
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:43,797
I'll do it immediately

365
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,304
Raju keep these Rs.200 &
give me an account

366
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,302
You have a wash, then we'll
go to see the caves

367
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:50,800
Oh you hunter

368
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,200
If you'll throw away the rat then
what'll you have for breakfast?

369
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,977
You haven't had breakfast eat it
- What's this nonsense? -

370
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:01,549
Will you bet Raju

371
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:09,823
I am sure that there should be
atleast one more cave

372
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,821
Then search it, I didn't find any

373
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,499
You'll see it when I
search it

374
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,896
And I am capable of
finding it

375
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,332
I may have to dig
the earth

376
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,008
Arrange for some labourers & for my
stay in the dak-bungalow

377
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,182
You go to town immediately and
bring these things

378
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:43,023
I feel that you should go
to town yourself...

379
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,192
I can't waste this valuable
time

380
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,055
But your wife is there alone

381
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:56,199
Oh yes! I forgot that, What
the hell is this?

382
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,372
You haven't married isn't it?

383
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:05,211
Here I have the most important job
of my life & there...

384
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,819
Madam Rosy open the door, I am
Raju guide...

385
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,953
I have a message for you
from Mr. Mathur

386
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,060
Raju, its of no use...

387
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,562
We're tired of doing the same thing
since morning

388
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,735
Do you have any such key which
can open all doors?

389
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,568
I have the master key but why open
somebody's door -

390
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,571
Take it out, I take full
responsibility give it

391
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,407
As you like it, take it

392
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,580
Oh God! I am scared what'll
happen now?

393
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,914
See Raju, I had told you
its poison isn't it?

394
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,088
Call the doctor immediately

395
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,323
Joseph, What's this?

396
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,462
You've made wonderful
arrangement

397
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:07,770
Enough... Enough...

398
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,780
Give pills every 4 hours
with coffee

399
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,793
Don't leave the patient alone under
any circumstances

400
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,120
No... l'll bring her husband
immediately

401
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,461
Raju have you gone mad?

402
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,634
It takes 10 hours to
Go & come -

403
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,633
And is my car a bullock cart that you
run it with a whip -

404
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,466
And in the jungle there is neither
road nor light, I won't go

405
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,902
Then what shall we do?

406
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,804
Look Raju I can't take any more
responsibility than this

407
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,140
I'm lucky that my heart
didn't fail

408
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,474
You do what you like

409
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:46,843
Either take the patient
from here

410
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,642
Or you take the responsibility of
looking after her

411
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:10,674
Do you want anything?

412
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,859
Run, rocks are
falling

413
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,240
You got up? How're
you feeling?

414
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,746
What are you doing here?

415
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,250
I was doing my job
& serving you

416
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:38,250
Where is he?
- He? There only

417
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,022
He didn't come in the
night also

418
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,266
Some important work cropped up

419
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:47,265
That work was more dear to
him than my life

420
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,104
He doesn't even know that you...

421
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,036
He thinks that I give
empty threats

422
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,275
Whatever I say I can't do it

423
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,606
That means you had told
him that you...

424
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,610
But he is not bothered

425
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,443
If I had died it would have been
good riddence for him

426
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:01,777
It would been better had
I died

427
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,048
You didn't listen fully you
didn't ask, why I came back

428
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:14,129
When we reached there he was
feeling sorry & missing you

429
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,300
What beautiful jungle, caves &
dak-bungalow and this Joseph!

430
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,469
Cooks so well only one
thing is lacking

431
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,196
If you bring Rosy it'll be work
and picnic both -

432
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,974
Here it is romantic, seclusion -

433
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,801
It would've been better
if Rosy was here

434
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,106
Believe me it was he who
said all these

435
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,544
You think I am lying

436
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,486
And you think you're telling
the truth

437
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,154
Here is the medicine I'll
send tea

438
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,656
I don't need it

439
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,829
You do need it, I'll come back

440
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,332
Now she is alright, continue
the medicine

441
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,369
You give her the medicine because
in the morning her cup of tea

442
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,507
Was used for washing
the clothes

443
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,234
I'll take it myself

444
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,176
Doctor there is no problem
if she travels

445
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,113
Because this lady is
going to her husband

446
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,007
No problem, it is better

447
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,180
Who told you that I'll go?

448
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,682
You didn't say, but I am worried
about Mr. Marco

449
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,582
He didn't come yesterday & you
took the pills

450
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,690
If you don't go today
he may take pills

451
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:23,697
If my husband would make me laugh like this I
wouldn't have defied him

452
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,869
And are you are defying me just
because I am making you laugh

453
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:29,539
Are you married?

454
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,702
No, so far God
has saved me

455
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:33,733
Why?

456
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,273
She'll be happy
with you

457
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,548
Madam, this is your thought
I am a very strict man -

458
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,217
I'll make her cook food take service
from her make her press my legs -

459
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:45,549
And I'll also slap her, if she
behaves like the way you behaved yesterday

460
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,558
Along with it will you love
her or not?

461
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,090
I'll definitely have
to love her

462
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:57,093
Then her life will be blessed even if you
make her to do whatever you said earlier

463
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,064
Raju, I'll not go -

464
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,443
But promise me, till the time
he asks anything about me -

465
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,406
You'll not say anything
about me

466
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:15,082
I am surprised that how could these
caves be hidden from the World till now?

467
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:19,077
The World which values
Ajanta, Ellora & Khajuraho -

468
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,584
How can I allow this treasure
to be concealed under the dust?

469
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:26,093
But Raju do you know why didn't
any assayer came here till now?

470
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,192
Because, I was destined
to do this job -

471
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:35,127
I was left to discover this
to understand its real worth -

472
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,940
To bring it to the limelight
which it really deserves

473
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,607
But Raju don't worry even your
name will be mentioned in the Book -

474
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:44,948
And it'll be definitely
mentioned

475
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,777
Because you are that man, who
has brought me till here

476
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,352
Aren't you forgetting anything?
- What?

477
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,783
For example, what the
time is and...

478
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,151
I thought probably I was forgetting
something about this cave

479
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:06,633
Sir, look in the city your...
I have brought your luggage from city

480
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,033
This idol definitely would have been
made during those times

481
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,035
Mr. Marco! Your luggage has been
brought back from the city

482
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,144
Oh good! Look Raju, right now
don't trouble me -

483
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,984
You go and serve food, I'll
just come back of you

484
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:27,157
Don't you want to ask
anything from me?

485
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,986
Didn't I say you go, I'll just come
I've to write some important notes

486
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,998
What I have to tell you, is
definitely more important

487
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,997
Oh God, so you'll not leave me
come on tell, what do you want to say?

488
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,163
If you don't have to ask me anything
then I don't have to say you anything

489
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,668
What a stupid
man he is?

490
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,362
Mr. Marco!

491
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:09,760
Raju, what's
the matter?

492
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,695
Don't you have to ask me about
your wife's condition?

493
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,375
Oh yes, what happened, has she
come here or has she gone?

494
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,043
Rosy, consumed poison

495
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,394
Look, she'll not believe
my words -

496
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,892
You yourself say that I couldn't
come last night because of this taxi

497
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,744
You are standing perfectly
allright

498
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,738
Aren't you happy?

499
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,349
But Raju had said
something else...

500
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:04,747
Rosy look if you are allright
and can commute -

501
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,417
Then instead of calling me here
you could've easily come there

502
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,096
Neither did I call anyone here
nor did I want to come there

503
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,595
Oh God, why don't you understand
that I don't have time even to breathe

504
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:19,432
Who is responsible for my time
that got wasted in to & fro

505
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,102
If your time get's wasted
to see your sick wife -

506
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,772
Then who is responsible for my life
which is getting wasted by staying with you?

507
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,778
First tell me, the reason behind
consuming the poison? -

508
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,107
What was the reason behind insulting
me in this new city?

509
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,112
What is that thing which
my money can't buy -

510
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,182
And which I have
deprived you with?

511
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,946
But still, you want to show
that I torture you a lot -

512
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,122
And you aren't interested
in living

513
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:43,115
Although I know, that you consumed
poison only to trouble me -

514
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,956
To show that I torture you
to take revenge on me -

515
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,631
Otherwise you should've consumed
2 more pills

516
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,299
So that you would've really
got relieved from me -

517
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,968
But you never
wanted this

518
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,871
Allright, accuse me, that
I don't want to die

519
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,646
Why don't you clearly say
that you want me to die

520
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:09,883
Raju, she's gone

521
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,885
Leave me, Leave me
Leave me...

522
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:29,161
Leave me... Leave me...

523
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,854
Don't follow me

524
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,373
Didn't I say you go now
I'll not do anything

525
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,214
Didn't I say, I'll not go even
If you come along with me

526
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:27,092
Do you see that small Island
there's a tomb of a dog

527
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:29,394
Of a dog?

528
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,898
It was Tajmahal's dog, he was
the pet of Maharana

529
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,068
A dog is better than me

530
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,073
Should I tell you
one thing -

531
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:42,903
The person who keeps cursing
his own destiny -

532
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,074
Even the destiny keeps
cursing that person

533
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,584
Come, Mr. Marco would be
waiting for you

534
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,532
Don't know how many days would
I spend in the caves -

535
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,100
If you intend going home
you can go

536
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,933
I have kept Rs 1000
in the envelope

537
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,288
Raju, will I get anklets
somewhere here?

538
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,114
Anklets why not?

539
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,794
How much?
- Sir Rs 10

540
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:40,801
Come

541
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,472
Let me atleast take
the change

542
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,707
The money is mine
or yours?

543
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,471
But the price of this
is only Rs 10

544
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,040
Today these are priceless
for me

545
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,802
Come, come

546
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:52,309
Sir...

547
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,326
What are you seeing?

548
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,349
Raju, where did you bring
such a sample from?

549
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,623
Rosy, for god sake, remove
these anklets and walk

550
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:35,187
Why?

551
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,426
What do you mean
why?

552
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,027
If you feel ashamed, then walk
on the other side of the road

553
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,201
Allright, even you'll remember

554
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,032
Now atleast help me

555
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,370
He is Raju, Guide, isn't it?
- He is the same

556
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,877
What is he doing here
along with this girl?

557
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,049
Probably he has
quit his job

558
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,108
Look...

559
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,449
Ay Guide, now show me
around -

560
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,122
Show me such a place that
my heart gets pepped up

561
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,550
How far is Chittor?

562
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,886
It's very far, and the
car is not there

563
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:14,056
What's the use of that Guide
Whose work stops because of a car

564
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,390
My mistake, I swear I'll never call myself
as Guide let's get back to hotel -

565
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:20,570
Otherwise people will think, that
I am walking with some drunkard

566
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:33,572
Don't you watch while driving?
Or you a human?

567
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,426
Will you not speak anything what
sort of a Guide are you?

568
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:55,594
I don't understand till yesterday
you looked as a 40 year oldwoman

569
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,707
Who has lost all her happiness, desires
& hopes on the middle of some road -

570
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,777
And today you look like a
16 years old girl -

571
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,980
Innocent, ignorant, full of
childhood mischief

572
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,248
Do you know, why?
- Why?

573
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,673
Madam Rosy, you are
a wonderful dancer

574
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:52,769
Really... Really...

575
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,909
Why did you give up dancing when
you have so much of talent?

576
00:51:58,915 --> 00:51:59,506
What should
I say-

577
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:04,514
Marco thinks, singing & dancing is
the profession of prostitutes

578
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:09,287
How did a man with good thoughts
meet with a cheap dancer like this?

579
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:14,929
There was no other way, mother
was a traditional dancing girl -

580
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,793
How could she take her daughter
out from that atmosphere?

581
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:22,367
But look at my destiny
Marco came in my life

582
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,367
He favoured me by
accepting me -

583
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,207
He obligated me by making me
the daughter-in-law of his house

584
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:37,383
Such a big house, so many servants
so much of money -

585
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,054
So much of rest
so much of fame -

586
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,388
And so much of love

587
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,524
Yes, so much of love

588
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,069
Rosy, the times are no more
the same

589
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,068
When the woman was considered
as a prostitute of the house

590
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:57,863
Used to cry, used to palipitate
used to bear -

591
00:52:58,074 --> 00:52:58,904
But she never used
to complain

592
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:00,910
The times are also no
more the same -

593
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,746
That one was considered cheap just
because he was born in a low caste -

594
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:04,914
And is born
in a low family

595
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,774
If I had the rights, I could
have proved to Mr. Marco -

596
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:09,582
That how high
your caste is

597
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:12,252
Mine?

598
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:13,422
Artiste's are not
bloody buffoons -

599
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:14,749
Today even respected people
respect the art -

600
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:16,849
How did Udayashankar earn
fame in the World?

601
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:17,889
Because of his nose -

602
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,993
And Shantaram, Saraswathi and...

603
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,256
Raju take such renowned names
that my destiny starts fluttering

604
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:24,592
You have never made
an attempt -

605
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,103
Otherwise who knows even after
listening to your name -

606
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:28,601
People's destiny would
start fluttering

607
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,008
No... I don't have
such a destiny

608
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:33,607
Destiny?

609
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:38,442
Make yourself so strong, that
before the destiny -

610
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:41,943
The God himself asks, tell me
what is your desire?

611
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:45,120
If you have the strength, dedication
talent & an interest -

612
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:48,387
Those which are impossible
should come infront of me

613
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:51,855
Why don't I talk to
Marco for once more

614
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,140
Raju, listen -

615
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:14,240
Why so much
of delay?

616
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:16,910
Even sir is very angry, there's
a lot of trouble inside

617
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:21,987
Rosy, I don't think this is the
right time for us to go in

618
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:22,820
Why?

619
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,660
Don't ask too many questions
we'll come tomorrow

620
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:27,830
Raju, I am not
a child

621
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:29,494
Is sir inside?

622
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:34,162
No, yes... No, No...

623
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,531
Come Rosy come...

624
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,277
Raju did you see, this
is what happens

625
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:27,556
If one drives a motor on the
road meant for bullock carts

626
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:30,386
Bloody, the road
attains the glory -

627
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,153
But the vehicle has to
look like this-

628
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,158
Only I know, how
obstinate this is-

629
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,563
If it refuses to move in
the middle of the night

630
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,634
Then, I can't even scold it
infront of madam

631
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:46,473
Bloody... Oh God!

632
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,873
Oh my friend, take half
of the cloth

633
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:12,967
Ay Raju... Raju just
get up and see

634
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:20,707
Had I been in
her place

635
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:24,280
I would have spit on that son of
a gun & would have told 3 times

636
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:25,448
Divorce... divorce... divorce

637
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:38,885
What's the matter?

638
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:44,697
You look over there
I'll see over here

639
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,984
Raju over here...

640
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:27,175
Raju, look over there

641
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:29,943
There is no way even from
that side

642
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,408
Hold this, and give
me your hand

643
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,841
Alright, Be careful, place
your feet carefully

644
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:38,350
If this is only
your courage

645
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,685
Then every woman will
feel ashamed on your life

646
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:42,687
Then, ls there no other way
to make a shelter?

647
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:45,861
If husband doesn't
give happiness

648
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,188
Can't one get it anywhere
else in the world

649
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:49,029
Marco is also fed up of you

650
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,859
But even he doesn't break his
head against the wall

651
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,535
He feels happy with the stone
idols in the caves...

652
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,029
Just because he
is a man

653
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,430
And you keep palipitating yourself just
because you are a woman

654
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,371
Rosy, it's wrong
absolutely wrong

655
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,374
Today the state in which you
are because

656
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:02,909
You haven't learnt to rebel
with this state

657
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:06,878
Or you swear that, the
one who kicks you-

658
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,550
You'll keep flattering him for
the rest of your life

659
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:09,710
And if not-

660
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,319
Then, there is no sin in demanding
your rights & making yourself stable

661
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,045
The sin is in keeping quiet
& bearing the torture

662
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,317
Ths sin is in losing the battle of
life living in suffocation

663
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,062
The sin is in committing suicide
committing suicide is sin...

664
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:21,560
Rosy, it's a sin
sin sin...

665
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:25,395
Nobody is anybody's slave
nobody is indigent on anybody

666
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,559
The word helplessness is only
a whim

667
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,564
While asleep everyone
is helpless

668
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,737
And when he wakes up the strength
automatically comes

669
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:34,307
And I have seen this strength
even in you the day when you... you

670
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:36,070
Had tied these

671
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:39,907
Even after this, lf you feel
yourself to be helpless, weak

672
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,411
I have no remedy
for it

673
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:44,582
I'll only regret, that why
I kept saving you form dying

674
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:46,755
That's because, there are
certain cowards

675
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,753
Who should get drowned & die
in a few drops of water

676
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,159
Then I'll feel ashamed, that at some
point I had a relation with you

677
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:07,675
What's it?

678
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:08,777
Where is sir?

679
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:12,277
He is near the Bank of the river
what are you doing here, go...

680
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,461
Rosy I had thought

681
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,867
That in this regard, whatever
discusion had to take plase

682
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:39,959
Has been over

683
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,531
And we had come down
to a decision

684
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:52,279
Marco, but it's not necessary that
all your decisions are mine too

685
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,049
But it was your
decision

686
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,447
That you wanted to leave the
profession of your mother

687
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,481
And wanted to earn a
respect of my name

688
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:03,350
Your name?

689
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:07,555
Now I have started finding more
respect in my mother's profession

690
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,495
Than in your name

691
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,403
If you want to gather a crowd by
the noise of Anklets, Tambourine & Lute

692
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:18,403
Then I don't have to remind you
that it's not possible in my house

693
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:26,080
Marco, there is atleast a little
difference in me & in these stone idols

694
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,847
They don't trouble me

695
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,915
They don't trouble you
because they are stones

696
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,413
And they are stones, that's why
they don't trouble you

697
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,150
You inserted a stone
in my heart-

698
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,086
Once you insert a heart
in these stones

699
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:45,925
Then you see, each & every idol will
shout & say, Marco I want to live...

700
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:47,334
Aren't you alive?

701
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,597
If forsaking all interests and then
living is living, then I am living

702
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,938
But, you have your work with
you what do I have?

703
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,608
What does a woman have
her house

704
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,771
A house is complete with husband
and children

705
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,614
What's my fault in this what do I
do when the God himself doesn't want

706
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:11,782
Marco, I am not blaming you, but
then in which hope should I live?

707
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,122
What dreams should I see
sitting the whole day?

708
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,796
What should I keep thinking by
staying awake the whole night?

709
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,464
If I don't have the happiness
of children come in my life

710
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:19,301
Then atleast let a little happiness
come in my life

711
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:20,196
Happiness... happiness...
happiness...

712
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,300
If all the happiness was left
only in dancing & singing

713
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,972
Then why the hell did you
leave your mother's house?

714
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,137
I left mother's house, so that I
would go to my husband's house

715
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:28,734
But how could I know, that over there
neither there'll be a husband nor house

716
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:30,136
What do you want?

717
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,474
Leaving all my work, I should keep
decorating flowers in your hair

718
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,547
Why did you marry, if you had
an aversion towards the flowers?

719
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:38,480
Not an interest, I married because, I
had an interest to invite trouble forever

720
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:39,814
Not an interest, it
was your neccessity

721
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:43,988
What cheap talk are
you speaking?

722
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,818
I am speaking it because
of your cheap acts

723
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:47,154
You call my love
to be lust?

724
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,498
And you call your
lust to be love?

725
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:53,324
You don't require a wife, you only
require a woman may be however she is

726
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,270
That's why your bed is more
dearer to you than me

727
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:59,902
Because it doesn't demand anything
after it subsides your lust

728
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,173
You are not a man, you
are a bloody Barbarian

729
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:12,349
Where are
you going?

730
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:13,680
How does it
concern you?

731
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,855
Without my permission, you can't
do any stupid act

732
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,527
Afterall, I have some
rights on you

733
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:24,529
May be?

734
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:28,203
How can you forget, on what
all I have done for you

735
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,866
The same, which I am going
to become

736
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:32,972
I'll not let
this happen

737
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:36,374
Any rowdy, vagabond or hooligan
by throwing 25 paise,50 paise or 1 Rupee

738
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,810
And after that, he ridicules me
and dispects me, I can't see

739
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:46,379
You can't, no problem, nobody
is forcing you to see

740
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:48,556
Whose conspiracy is this, who has
put this idea in your mind?

741
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:49,452
Who has instigated you?

742
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,556
What new thing has happened, that
leaving this comfortable life

743
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:53,388
You don't have the fear of
wandering from one street to another?

744
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:56,288
I was asleep
I woke up

745
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,060
Is there no other reason, tell me
I want to know

746
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,394
Have you found
another man?

747
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,470
May be, it's possible

748
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:10,735
What... you mean to say
you have someone else

749
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:18,082
Marco, lf I become unfaithful
I'll do it openly

750
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:22,086
Not by giving an excuse of work
doing it secretly in some dense forest

751
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:24,490
So?

752
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,091
You are suspecting me
you are insulting me

753
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:29,593
Don't think, that by falsely
accusing me

754
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:32,199
You have got an excuse of
becoming characterless?

755
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:34,693
Anything more?

756
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,763
If you really what to listen
then listen

757
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:39,931
Even for a day, I didn't forget
what blood flows in you

758
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,941
I married you under the pretence
after knowing everything

759
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:46,643
That I am buying you
for my necessity

760
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,783
If women like you have
a notion

761
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,619
That you are worthy of becoming
a wife of some respected person

762
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,118
Then, there is no stupid person
more than you

763
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:58,620
Listen one more thing, I hate
you, I hate you, I hate you...

764
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:00,792
Even If you go, there'll be
1000's coming like you

765
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,294
Go, get lost from here

766
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:33,488
Raju, will you give support
to a helpless woman?

767
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:41,129
Bring the luggage in, I'll make
you meet my mother, keep it here

768
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:45,268
Mother, look we have a guest
at home, her name is Rosy

769
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:49,341
Don't have a wrong estimate of
her religion with her name

770
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:50,637
Her pet name
is Rosy

771
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,848
You make some tea or coffee
I'll make her get freshen up

772
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:54,513
After that we'll
go out

773
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:05,360
You ignited a spark in me
I burnt down my entire house

774
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:12,190
Raju, I am totally ruined
I have no one in this world

775
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:16,868
You're lucky, I was worried that
she may get angry...

776
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:25,645
When I look back, I only find
ash, & ruins around me

777
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:33,885
In the front a long a deserted
lane, whose destination is unknown

778
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,826
Rosy, in those ruins look a
guide is standing

779
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:44,066
You are looking at the path
but not the co-traveller

780
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,298
I had asked your support
for a few days

781
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:54,171
I never intended of transferring
my burden of my life on you

782
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,737
Trust me, this burden will definitely
reduce the worries of my life

783
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:02,748
Raju, I am blemished

784
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:09,250
If you are blemished, then
I accept this blemish fully

785
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:16,791
No... No Raju this is not possible
I had never even thought of it

786
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,425
It was a sin of thinking it till
yesterday, but today its different

787
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,766
It was a sin of telling it till
yesterday but today its different

788
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,933
Rosy, I want to see dreams for you
and I want to make them a reality

789
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:26,665
Give me the permission

790
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:33,809
I can't give you anything I can't
promise you, don't put me in a fix

791
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:38,282
My shadow may
ruin you

792
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,950
Will you listen to me patiently
you are not making any promise

793
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,284
I want to place your hand on my
heart and make a promise

794
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:58,546
Who is she, where has
she come from?

795
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,173
Mother, she is a tourist, I had
met her at the station

796
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:03,050
How did she come alone
why did she come?

797
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,946
Not alone, her husband
was with her

798
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:06,712
Is she married?

799
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:08,453
Mother she is a
destitute woman

800
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:10,892
What is that marriage, where there
is no body & soul involved

801
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,488
There is not much time
left even in the divorce

802
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:14,060
So, she has left him and
has come to you

803
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:15,896
Mother, she has not come to me
she has come to you

804
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:19,391
If you want to drive her away
do it now, later don't blame me

805
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:20,397
What are you saying?

806
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:21,101
Go to sleep

807
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:27,042
I am only thinking about the
neighbourhood, what's my problem?

808
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,777
Brother Raju, sometimes
even call us

809
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:12,613
Or you watch the private
show all alone

810
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,287
You must be having mother
sister at home

811
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:21,121
Otherwise, I would
have told...

812
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,692
Yes, we have mother's & sister

813
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,460
But we don't have some
dancing beauty

814
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:31,135
You are dead...

815
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:52,987
Come down, I say come down
come down

816
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,346
Now, only this was left
isn't it?

817
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:13,014
What happened?

818
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,523
Who is asking for oranges, I am
asking the address of Raju Guide

819
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,692
Didn't I say that Raju Guide
no more comes here

820
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:26,520
He has eloped with
one dancer

821
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:30,531
Today is your last day
but you never came all these days

822
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:32,199
Are you going, or should
I kick you...

823
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:35,028
No, I'll not go & who are
you to kick me out?

824
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,200
And this shop is not yours
what did you say?

825
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:38,872
Father...

826
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:40,538
You son of a father, where
are all the goods

827
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,369
And what's this cash box
doing here?

828
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:43,545
It's my first
month earning

829
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,710
What are you talking to the child?
Talk to me

830
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,314
Your son has snatched
my shop

831
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,709
First thing, this shop is
no more yours

832
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:52,917
Master make him understand

833
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:56,053
Every passenger complains
that you'r not available at the station

834
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:57,722
So your contract has been
cancelled from this month

835
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:59,223
And a new contract has been awarded
to Banwarilal

836
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,894
This shop was of my father
now it is mine

837
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:04,224
Let me see, who dares to
push me out from here?

838
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,060
So this is the matter, come here
I'll make you understand

839
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:11,731
Ramu, come here

840
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:16,911
Gaffoor, come fast, they are
hitting Raju

841
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,137
Raju, this is all happening
because of me

842
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:23,310
No Rosy, No...

843
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:30,310
Here take this brother
take this

844
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,149
And sister, these vegetables
are from own farm

845
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:39,218
Add salt to these bitter gourds &
then fry them in mustard oil

846
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,495
I tell you, lt'll be
very tasty

847
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:45,428
Alright, you sit, I'll make
tea for you

848
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:50,171
I went for a hearing, when I
returned I got your telegram

849
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:53,504
Greetings uncle

850
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:54,573
May you live long

851
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:58,107
Mother, you didn't tell me that you
have sent a telegram to uncle

852
01:16:58,413 --> 01:16:59,175
She didn't tell you

853
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:04,516
Sister, you must consult elders
in such matters

854
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:07,351
I've heard a lot of
rumors about you

855
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,850
I'll punish you
severely

856
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:11,685
Here take tea
- Give it

857
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:17,699
Continue the practice

858
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:20,360
This is my house, I'm not scared
of anybody

859
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,364
Dance, dance practice

860
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:29,868
So you're busy in this

861
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,871
There wasn't a person in
our family

862
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:35,376
Who'll make the she monkey dance

863
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:37,047
Bring a tabot

864
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,281
Enough Rosy, rest for tomorrow

865
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:45,386
Hey you girl... ls this your
father's house?

866
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:48,559
Your brother's house, your
husband's house?

867
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:50,561
If not then why are
you here?

868
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:53,394
We don't keep dancers
in the house

869
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:54,226
Come this side, uncle

870
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,232
Why're you shedding
crocodile tears?

871
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:58,235
I am talking sense
understand that

872
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:02,235
Take the train to Delhi and go
away from here

873
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:04,241
I'll buy the ticket for you

874
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,073
Had you not been my uncle I would
have told you -

875
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:07,908
That you don't know how
talk to girls

876
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,583
Things have reached to that pass

877
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:13,084
In my house before you scold my
guest you'll have to deal with me

878
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:15,256
You dare to talk back to me
dogs child

879
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:19,088
By abusing my father you are
giving good respect to your sister

880
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:20,921
For a prostitute
- Uncle

881
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:24,527
Do debauchery outside this house
- Mother

882
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,428
Tell your brother to hold
his tongue... otherwise...

883
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,933
What'll you do? Let me
also know

884
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,108
Now are you happy?
You're contended, isn't it?

885
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:34,775
Mother

886
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:36,273
Don't dare... Mother

887
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:04,464
How peaceful it is now...

888
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:08,468
You didn't feel offended?

889
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,137
Raju, I've decided that

890
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:13,310
I'll go

891
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,813
I've also decided
- What?

892
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:17,314
That you'll not go

893
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:19,711
Enough, I don't want to hear
anything else

894
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:27,158
Only 1 hour is left for
train's departure

895
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:28,996
Passenger is ready
