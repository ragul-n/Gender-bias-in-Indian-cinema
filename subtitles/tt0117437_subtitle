1
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:33,388
It's amazing! Your birthday and
your daughter's birthday...

2
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:35,326
..fall on the same day.

3
00:04:35,497 --> 00:04:38,989
Yes. And we celebrate
our birthdays together...

4
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:41,502
..on the same day
every year:

5
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:43,764
Where's Mrs. Sehgal?

6
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:52,072
There are people
who want to meet you.

7
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:57,980
This is my brother.

8
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,118
This is my nephew, Jai...

9
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:07,592
And who's she?

10
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:13,695
Ah! Aarti...

11
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:31,635
Looking at your figure,
it doesn't appear...

12
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:33,647
..that you're the mother
of such a grown-up girll.

13
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,815
Who told you that
I'm her mother?

14
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:38,680
I'm only her step-mother.

15
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:44,183
But my sister loves Aarti more
than her real mother would.

16
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:51,966
Isn't Aunt a bit foolish?
Not a bit. She's very foolish.

17
00:06:56,104 --> 00:07:01,872
You want to go to Palankhet?
What's there to laugh about?

18
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:06,313
People go to see America
and Europe, whereas...

19
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:10,345
..you want to visit a tiny
hill-station like Palankhet?

20
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:14,113
Why don't you go to
Switzerland instead?

21
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,251
Because what I can find at Palankhet,
I cannot find elsewhere.

22
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:23,392
What's so special at Palankhet?
My mother's memories.

23
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:29,161
Father...didn't you meet mother for
the first time at Palankhet?

24
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:32,871
Look... it is Shalini now
who is your mother.

25
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:35,735
Forget the one who is dead.

26
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:39,445
Let her go if she wishes to.

27
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:43,250
Besides, aren't you visiting
Germany for a few days, too?

28
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:45,750
Yes....when do you
wish to leave?

29
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:47,946
When are you leaving
for Germany, Father?

30
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:50,250
I'm leaving tomorrow itself.

31
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:53,289
All right. Then I'll
also leave tomorrow.

32
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:55,895
But I cannot permit you
to go all alone.

33
00:07:56,498 --> 00:08:00,730
What'll people say? That I let my
young daughter go all by herself?.

34
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:02,259
She's right.

35
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:06,430
Gulab and Kamal... you must
accompany Aarti tomorrow.

36
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:09,202
To Switzerland?
Not Switzerland.

37
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,403
What did you say was
the name of that place?

38
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:48,676
Had you telephoned the Hotel Taj?

39
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:51,114
Did you ask them to
send a car?

40
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:54,051
Has the car arrived then?

41
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:58,126
What can one say? The hotels
here are all useless.

42
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:01,057
Had we telephoned London...
This is not London.

43
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:04,666
Will you continue to stare at me,
or do something about it?

44
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,358
There's an only taxi
parked there.

45
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:10,164
If we miss that one too,
we'll be stranded here.

46
00:09:10,238 --> 00:09:15,335
She's right... Please stay here.
We'll go and fetch the taxi.

47
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:24,077
Raja Hindustani.
Raja Hindustani...?

48
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:27,219
The licence number is 420
(as in cheats ).

49
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:30,890
Anyway, what does it have got
to do with us? Come on...

50
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:43,866
These people are very lazy.
He's taking a nap. What now?

51
00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:45,702
I'll wake him up.

52
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:48,899
Hey! Wake up!
Hey! What're you doing?

53
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:52,480
Who're you?
I'm the helper on this taxi.

54
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:55,047
My name is Rajnikant.

55
00:09:55,984 --> 00:10:01,115
Wake your driver. We wish
to go to Palankhet.

56
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:02,780
We can't go.

57
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:07,150
Why can't you?
The boss sleeps at this hour.

58
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,795
He sleeps at this hour? Is he in
eternal sleep that he can't wake up?

59
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:14,527
Hold one leg.
I'll hold the other.

60
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:17,137
Let's see how he doesn't wake up.
Come on...Get up!

61
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:20,206
Wake up, O descendent
of the demons!

62
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:38,625
O descendent of the demons?!
What do you think of yourself?.

63
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:51,237
Who dared wake up the
Indian King of Hearts!?

64
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:54,701
Not me, Boss. They did.
These people?

65
00:10:57,412 --> 00:11:01,041
Who addressed me as a descendant
of the demons?

66
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:03,447
Not me, Boss. They did.
They did?

67
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,852
Who thumped my cab?
Not me. They did.

68
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:10,057
They did?

69
00:11:13,562 --> 00:11:16,326
Aren't you ashamed of raising
your hand on a woman?

70
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:18,932
Woman? Is she a woman?

71
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:22,526
What else? Can't you see?
And who're you? Her sister?

72
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:30,839
I'm male. My name is Gulab Singh.
She's Kamal, a female.

73
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:36,072
Everything is wrong here. Hot is
cold and cold is hot.

74
00:11:36,184 --> 00:11:40,348
Don't you know about them?
About whom?

75
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:55,594
Shut up, will you? We want a taxi
to take us to Palankhet.

76
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,935
Just tell me if you
will come along.

77
00:11:58,106 --> 00:12:00,404
No.
And why not?

78
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:03,339
I don't feel like it.
I don't want to go.

79
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:06,310
Then how'll we go?
Put the luggage on your head...

80
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:08,380
..and walk the distance
of 250 kilometers.

81
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,648
But just listen...
Didn't I say no?

82
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:15,549
But please listen...
Didn't I say no?

83
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,554
We're new here. And there's
no other taxi around, too.

84
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:26,099
Please help us.
You may charge us money.

85
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:28,963
How much would you charge?
500 rupees?

86
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:34,740
All right. Take 600 rupees.

87
00:12:50,926 --> 00:12:54,225
All right. Tell me.
How much will you charge?

88
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:57,058
Boss...

89
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:02,566
- 500 rupees will be enough.

90
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:04,498
What?
Yes.

91
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:07,967
- 500 rupees is enough. As it is,
our taxi belongs to Palankhet.

92
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:11,302
How amazing! When I asked
you, you refused.

93
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:14,006
But when Madam asked,
you agreed. Why so?

94
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:16,040
That's my look-out!

95
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:17,912
Fetch Madam's luggage.
Yes, Boss.

96
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:20,714
Please come, Madam. Be seated.

97
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:25,626
Hey! Where are you going?
To sit with Madam.

98
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,126
No way. Madam will make herself
comfortable in the rear seat!

99
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:30,125
Come on. Let's sit in the front.
No, not in the front.

100
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:32,365
My cleaner, Rajnikant,
sits up front with me.

101
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:34,994
As it is, while driving, sometimes
I shake my hands and legs.

102
00:13:35,036 --> 00:13:37,698
Then where will we sit?
Yes...where will they sit?

103
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:42,434
Don't be worried. I've a special
airl-conditioned place for them.

104
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:44,871
Where's that?
Above.

105
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:54,083
Looks like he's
going to kill us!

106
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:58,754
Hold tightly! I think that
this man is crazy

107
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:04,022
What're you doing?

108
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,274
Look ahead, Boss! Or you
might cause an accident.

109
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:15,139
Shut up!

110
00:14:15,377 --> 00:14:17,538
Excuse me...
Yes, Madam?

111
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,877
How far is Palankhet from here?

112
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:23,575
- 28 hours in a bullock cart.
5 hours in a ramshackle bus.

113
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:27,279
And 3 hours flat in
Raja Hindustani's taxi.

114
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:32,222
Your name is Raja Hindustani?

115
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:34,585
Yes. Didn't you like it?

116
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:37,824
No...it's fine. But it's
a bit different, isn't it?

117
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:41,800
Yes, Madam. It's different.
My name is different from others.

118
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,770
My name is Raja because I'm
the King of my moods.

119
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:48,102
Nobody can dominate me. And
I'm a Hindustani because...

120
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:52,337
in this country, you find Hindus,
Ssikhs, Christians, Muslims...

121
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:54,381
but no Indians...

122
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:59,718
I'm an orphan. When I was a kid,
my father passed away.

123
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:03,286
Now I'm just the child
of my country.

124
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:06,722
You're a very interesting
person:

125
00:15:07,162 --> 00:15:08,288
Am I not?

126
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:11,762
Thank you, Madam.

127
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:28,141
What's this?
Why? Madam?

128
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:30,649
It's an English song. People from
the city really enjoy it.

129
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:34,551
I don't like it.
Switch it off.

130
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,755
Very well, Madam.

131
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:53,737
What's this?
It's a hit Hindi film song.

132
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:57,808
I don't like that either.
Please switch it off.

133
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:00,840
All right...

134
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:31,570
Why did you stop it?

135
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:35,049
That's a nice song.
Let it play.

136
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:38,511
It was not a cassette.
It was me singing.

137
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:40,481
You?
Yes.

138
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:42,890
Do you also sing?
Yes.

139
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:47,024
Would you like to hear me?
Sure.

140
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:34,531
There's no booking in
your name at this hotel.

141
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:36,437
How is that possible?

142
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:39,341
Our booking has been confirmed
at this hotel.

143
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,747
You had telephoned them,
didn't you?

144
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:46,977
What's this?
Why're you crying?

145
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:50,180
I made the booking.
But not for this Taj.

146
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:52,119
I booked you at the
Taj Mahal in Agra.

147
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,525
What?

148
00:22:53,728 --> 00:22:56,526
Are you out of your mind?

149
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:04,400
Please book two rooms
for us right now.

150
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:06,905
There's a conference in
progress right now.

151
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:09,774
You won't find any accommodation
in the whole of Palanpur.

152
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:12,778
What should we do now?

153
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,144
Why're you worried? Come with me.
Where?

154
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:19,751
To a place where there are not
just 5-stars, but countless ones.

155
00:23:19,954 --> 00:23:22,923
To a place where one
serves with feelings.

156
00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:26,083
To a place where the doors are open
even if there's no place.

157
00:23:26,227 --> 00:23:28,218
Come on...
But Raja...

158
00:23:28,396 --> 00:23:30,728
Where is such a place?

159
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,678
Come along, Madam. Please come...

160
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:47,746
Look...what a beautiful
place this is!

161
00:23:47,915 --> 00:23:50,475
After all, you did lie!

162
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:54,520
Even a blind man wouldn't call
this place as five-star.

163
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:59,192
Is this a hotel or a rest-house?
How can the young lady live here?

164
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:01,195
Even a donkey wouldn't like
to be tied to such a place.

165
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:03,193
In that case, the donkeys might
return to where they come from.

166
00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:06,058
You called me a donkey!

167
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:12,696
Why're you arguing with him?
It's a good enough place.

168
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:15,207
It's better than the
5-star hotel.

169
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:19,370
Is this somebody's residence?

170
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,548
Yes. It's the residence of
my Uncle and Aunt.

171
00:24:21,682 --> 00:24:24,014
This taxi too belongs to them.
I only drive it around.

172
00:24:24,352 --> 00:24:26,582
Are they your blood relatives?
No.

173
00:24:26,687 --> 00:24:28,814
It's not blood that ties us
together, but our hearts.

174
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:32,025
You know how we Indians form
a relationship everywhere.

175
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,161
My relationship with Uncle and
Aunty too is a similar one.

176
00:24:35,296 --> 00:24:37,924
Hurry up! Go and tell Uncle
that Madam has come.

177
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:38,795
All right.

178
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:43,029
Also tell them that she has
brought two maidservants along.

179
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:44,864
Hey! What did you say?

180
00:24:49,477 --> 00:24:51,843
What happened? You cut your
hands, didn't you?

181
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:53,676
Hey! What're you doing?
Why?

182
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:56,280
People say that if a tigress
tastes blood...

183
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,113
she doesn't spare
anybody alive.

184
00:24:58,252 --> 00:25:01,221
Really? So I'm a tigress, eh?
And what're you?

185
00:25:01,322 --> 00:25:03,051
I'm a sheep.

186
00:25:06,427 --> 00:25:09,794
You've come?
Yes. Boss too has come.

187
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:12,099
He has brought
along a madam too.

188
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,062
A Madam...?

189
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:16,933
A madam with Raja?

190
00:25:17,471 --> 00:25:21,532
Let me go and see which Madam
Raja has brought along.

191
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:26,304
You're very beautiful.
What's your name?

192
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,244
Aarti.
Ah! What a lovely name!

193
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,974
Yes, it's a lovely name.

194
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:34,816
You may stay here for
as long as you wish.

195
00:25:34,855 --> 00:25:37,187
You don't have to go
to any hotel.

196
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:39,986
Come on.
Please come, Madam.

197
00:25:40,194 --> 00:25:42,560
Go and get the luggage.
And you, maidservants...

198
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,322
Go and help him.

199
00:25:44,932 --> 00:25:46,627
Please come, Madam.

200
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:49,133
Just a minute.

201
00:25:50,604 --> 00:25:52,094
I'd forgotten.

202
00:25:54,008 --> 00:25:56,101
She's my wife.

203
00:25:56,277 --> 00:25:59,576
And this poor man is my husband.
He's performing his duties.

204
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:03,476
Uncle and Aunty are always
pulling each other's leg.

205
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:07,487
Why're you standing far away?
Come closer.

206
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:13,488
Greetings.
Bless you.

207
00:26:14,862 --> 00:26:18,821
What're you doing?
Guests stand for good fortune.

208
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:21,797
How can good fortune enter the
house without a welcome?

209
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:23,560
Yes, of course.

210
00:27:50,224 --> 00:27:51,156
Hey!

211
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:52,659
Why did you throw water on me?

212
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:56,490
I couldn't help it. After all,
it was only a hand. It shook.

213
00:27:56,664 --> 00:27:59,565
The day my hand shakes, your
brains will start shaking.

214
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,191
It's your mind which
is wavering, Boss!

215
00:28:02,403 --> 00:28:06,305
What did you say?
Whom were you gazing at?

216
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:12,211
I was admirling the morning....the
Sun that shines so brightly!

217
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,549
But the sun rises
in that dirlection.

218
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,676
When did it get to rise
in this dirlection?

219
00:28:17,718 --> 00:28:19,481
You're getting to be
too smart nowadays.

220
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,789
Want a beating?
For your beautiful Sun's sake!

221
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:29,994
Well...wash the car
properly today.

222
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,793
I must take madam
to the market today.

223
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:34,423
Please come.

224
00:28:34,702 --> 00:28:38,866
Look at this beautiful
taxi-stand of Palanpur.

225
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:42,066
She hasn't come here from Mumbai
just to see a taxi-stand.

226
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:44,868
Hey! This taxi-stand is
our bread-earner.

227
00:28:45,045 --> 00:28:47,707
If you criticise it, I'll punch
your ears and nose together!

228
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:49,611
What's this?

229
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:54,686
What's going on? Come on...
let's go and see something else.

230
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:57,989
All right...as you wish.

231
00:28:58,025 --> 00:29:01,825
Wait a minute...you can't leave
without meeting my dearest friend.

232
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:04,191
Hey there!

233
00:29:04,532 --> 00:29:05,658
Who is it?

234
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,832
Raja! My friend!

235
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:11,468
My dear friend!

236
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:48,465
Madam! This is my friend!

237
00:29:50,277 --> 00:29:51,972
My dearest friend.

238
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:53,980
He's the president
of this taxi-union.

239
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:58,544
And this is madam!
She's come from Mumbai.

240
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:01,379
Greetings. Please come in.
Let me serve you refreshments.

241
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:03,989
I've got some shopping to do.

242
00:30:04,158 --> 00:30:06,888
Yes...I've got to help her
with the shopping.

243
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:10,861
But please treat the two of
them. I'm going with madam.

244
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:14,162
Sure. You can sit with me and
enjoy some refreshments!

245
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:16,929
Meanwhile, I'll do some shopping.

246
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,807
Don't you worry.

247
00:30:21,976 --> 00:30:24,137
How're you related to Madam?

248
00:30:24,812 --> 00:30:26,541
I'm her body-guard.

249
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:30,309
You're a robust body-guard.
Why don't you embrace me too?

250
00:30:30,784 --> 00:30:33,309
Leave me! Leave me!

251
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:37,014
Scoundrel!
Just a minute.

252
00:30:37,524 --> 00:30:39,389
Let me go!
You're all right.

253
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,793
Just once more.
Leave me!

254
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:46,890
There's something wrong.

255
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:49,231
Please come inside.

256
00:30:51,372 --> 00:30:54,739
Please come in.
Sit there. Sit here.

257
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:58,706
Bring two glasses of
some great butter-milk!

258
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:02,207
It's so warm. Come on...
Take off your sweater.

259
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:05,375
It's so warm. Take it off.
Let me go. I won't remove it.

260
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:08,646
Why not? I'll remove it for you.

261
00:31:09,256 --> 00:31:12,589
Strange! A brave man takes off
his dress at the drop of a hat!

262
00:31:12,793 --> 00:31:14,385
But he's feeling shy
as ifhe were a girll!

263
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:17,292
She is a girll. Wouldn't she
feel shy like a girll then?

264
00:31:18,265 --> 00:31:19,789
Are you a girll?

265
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:22,064
That's why I was wondered...

266
00:31:22,236 --> 00:31:25,967
why bells rang in my mind
everytime I touched you!

267
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,974
Beware! Don't you
call me a girll!

268
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:41,621
This is Aarti speaking.

269
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:44,986
Yes...?
Pass on the phone to father.

270
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,956
He hasn't yet returned
from Germany.

271
00:31:47,161 --> 00:31:49,857
When will he return?
In a few days time.

272
00:31:49,997 --> 00:31:51,965
Ifhe telephones, please
tell him that...

273
00:31:52,132 --> 00:31:55,727
I'm not staying at the Taj, but
with a very nice couple.

274
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:00,400
Theirl address is...
Fax your address to us.

275
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,976
Whether she lives at the Taj, or
elsewhere, why must I bother?

276
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,208
I disconnected the phone.

277
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,852
You're an expert in
faking the act, Sister.

278
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:18,616
I've learnt from none
other than you, Brother.

279
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:23,320
Well said...if you continue to
follow my dirlections...

280
00:32:23,397 --> 00:32:27,333
the whole property will be
transferred to our name one day.

281
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:29,569
And what about Aarti?

282
00:32:29,903 --> 00:32:33,464
Her problem will be
solved by itself.

283
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,468
Just a minute, Madam.

284
00:32:41,215 --> 00:32:43,740
Take this, Madam.
What is it?

285
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:46,511
Please keep it.
But what is it?

286
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:50,987
Shopkeepers here give guides a
commission for bringing customers.

287
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,956
This is my commission.

288
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:54,891
You may keep it. You're
entitled to it.

289
00:32:55,095 --> 00:32:57,063
No, Madam. How can I take
commission from your money?

290
00:32:57,164 --> 00:32:58,722
Please keep it.

291
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,391
What did you say?

292
00:33:01,535 --> 00:33:03,765
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

293
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,502
What did you say?

294
00:33:10,778 --> 00:33:14,714
When I say thank you, you
should say ''you're welcome''.

295
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:16,676
What was that?

296
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:20,286
What?
Firlst say you...

297
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:23,690
Not Gu...say You.

298
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:28,654
Never mind. You won't be
able to say it. Let's go.

299
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:32,529
I won't be able to say it?!
Why won't I be able to say it?

300
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,657
Come on, Raja.
Let's go, Madam.

301
00:33:40,574 --> 00:33:41,973
What did she say?

302
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:45,370
Yes...

303
00:33:57,257 --> 00:33:58,724
Boss...

304
00:33:58,992 --> 00:34:01,517
What is it?
You're doing it without reason.

305
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:04,891
Nothing's going to happen.
Just get lost!

306
00:34:05,132 --> 00:34:09,626
It's your time to get lost.
Madam has been asking for you.

307
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:13,667
What? Has Madam asked for me?
That's wonderful!

308
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:26,107
Madam....you asked for me?

309
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:29,287
I've got such a nice place
to live in, thanks to you.

310
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:31,787
You've showed me
around the whole town,...

311
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:33,324
helped me in the shopping...

312
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,690
and you didn't even
collect your commission.

313
00:34:35,863 --> 00:34:38,058
That was only my duty, Madam.

314
00:34:38,332 --> 00:34:42,769
But you didn't even ask for
any money. Why?

315
00:34:42,936 --> 00:34:46,269
Where's the hurry?
I'm here. And you're here too...

316
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,074
You'll be here for
a few days, won't you?

317
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:53,408
Still...take this.
But this is too much, Madam.

318
00:34:53,614 --> 00:34:55,741
I've asked Rajnikant
for the accounts.

319
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:58,908
This 800 rupees is for the taxi.

320
00:34:58,952 --> 00:35:03,719
And this 200 rupees
is your tip.

321
00:35:07,394 --> 00:35:09,385
My tip?
Yes.

322
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,125
How can I accept
any tips from you?

323
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,689
Why not?

324
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:16,828
I can't accept it.
Why not?

325
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,767
You can accept it from others,
and why not from me?

326
00:35:22,776 --> 00:35:24,676
Are you feeling shy?

327
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,280
Is this less?
Do you want some more?

328
00:35:30,851 --> 00:35:33,217
Take it, I say...
Keep it!

329
00:35:39,126 --> 00:35:41,651
All right. You may go now.

330
00:35:49,102 --> 00:35:50,433
Yes...?

331
00:36:01,114 --> 00:36:04,015
Fool!
Don't worry. I'm with you.

332
00:36:09,756 --> 00:36:10,780
Let me speak.

333
00:36:11,558 --> 00:36:13,219
Hey! Raja!
What is it?

334
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:16,254
Come...we want to go
to the market.

335
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:17,886
I don't want to go
to the market.

336
00:36:17,998 --> 00:36:20,933
Why not?
The boss is in a foul mood.

337
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:23,866
Foul mood, my foot! There's nothing
wrong with the car, is there?

338
00:36:24,204 --> 00:36:26,297
Didn't I say that I won't
go to the market?

339
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:30,538
Are you doing us a favour? Haven't
we paid you for the cab?

340
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:31,843
You, there!
Just a minute.

341
00:36:32,045 --> 00:36:34,809
The madam has paid me.
I'm answerable only to her!

342
00:36:34,948 --> 00:36:36,472
not to her servants!

343
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,245
Look at how he uses
his tongue!

344
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,648
You there!

345
00:36:41,888 --> 00:36:46,689
If the boss gives you a punch,
you'll begin shaking terribly.

346
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:49,219
Don't you dare touch him!

347
00:36:49,696 --> 00:36:51,755
If I go and complain
to madam...

348
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:54,092
How dare you try to scare me
by using her name!

349
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:57,065
Go and complain to her!
I'm not scared ofher.

350
00:36:57,304 --> 00:37:00,273
You aren't scared?
We're not scared.

351
00:37:04,378 --> 00:37:06,278
Leave them. Let's go.

352
00:37:07,848 --> 00:37:09,941
Not like this.
How else?

353
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,951
What? Does Madam
praise me a lot?

354
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:16,815
I suppose you aren't
playing some mischief.

355
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,551
We swear.

356
00:37:20,594 --> 00:37:22,789
Why would we lie?

357
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:27,592
I swear upon this little one.
Don't you swear upon me.

358
00:37:27,701 --> 00:37:31,296
Just listen to all that
the madam says about you.

359
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:33,871
Really? What does madam say?

360
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,441
Madam says that Raja is
so handsome!

361
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:37,736
Is it?
Boss...

362
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:39,276
Just shut up...what else
does madam say?

363
00:37:39,346 --> 00:37:43,305
She praises your singing,
walking and laughing.

364
00:37:43,717 --> 00:37:45,241
Is it?
But I regret...

365
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:47,114
What do you regret?

366
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:49,048
Must I tell him?
Go ahead.

367
00:37:50,023 --> 00:37:51,854
She says that everything about
Raja is nice.

368
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:54,520
But neither does he have
class, nor style.

369
00:37:55,295 --> 00:37:56,762
What's that?

370
00:37:57,497 --> 00:38:01,797
It about how one walks, talks,
dresses and conducts himself.

371
00:38:01,968 --> 00:38:05,335
One has to play the hero.

372
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:07,770
The hero? Really?

373
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:11,201
Madam likes all that.
Yes. She digs that.

374
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:13,140
All right, then. I'll do that.

375
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,239
I'll wear nice dresses.
Behave like a hero.

376
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:16,943
Boss...
Shut up...

377
00:38:17,617 --> 00:38:21,246
But I don't know anything.
How will I do it all?

378
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:24,920
What're we for?

379
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,616
Boss...
You should help me.

380
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:05,615
Did you see Raja's style?

381
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,378
Isn't it classy?

382
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:11,147
Just like a hero!

383
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,480
What's this?

384
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:52,225
Stop fooling around.

385
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:55,732
Wait!

386
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:05,378
But what was the need
to do such foolish things?

387
00:42:05,478 --> 00:42:08,311
Because I am a fool...
a total fool!

388
00:42:09,883 --> 00:42:13,876
But let me tell you something.
Nobody can fool me otherwise.

389
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,514
But they named you,
and I got fooled.

390
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,428
You're not a fool.
You're just a simpleton.

391
00:42:25,231 --> 00:42:28,758
You're a very decent man,
aren't you?

392
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:30,266
It's of no use.

393
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,066
Decency and simplicity is
of no use in this world.

394
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:39,405
People with a clean heart
have no place in this world.

395
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:42,912
But people with a clean heart
cannot have any worth.

396
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:45,051
After all, they're priceless.

397
00:42:47,454 --> 00:42:50,787
How wonderful! You've just
said something so true!

398
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:56,018
You can't place a price on
clean-hearted people.

399
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:59,128
They're priceless.
Just like you are.

400
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:03,969
Me?
Yes...you.

401
00:43:08,942 --> 00:43:10,637
Just a minute, Madam.

402
00:43:11,911 --> 00:43:14,505
Give me 200 rupees. Hurry up.

403
00:43:14,948 --> 00:43:17,109
- 200 rupees?
Keep all of it.

404
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:19,144
No. Just 200 rupees.

405
00:43:19,486 --> 00:43:21,886
Here, Madam.
What is this?

406
00:43:22,188 --> 00:43:25,055
A tip.
A tip?

407
00:43:25,225 --> 00:43:28,217
Yes, Madam. That day, you liked
what I said. And you rewarded me.

408
00:43:28,428 --> 00:43:30,419
Today I liked what you said.
So I'm giving you a tip.

409
00:43:30,563 --> 00:43:32,258
The scores are level!

410
00:43:33,433 --> 00:43:36,231
Please take it, Madam.
But...

411
00:43:36,302 --> 00:43:38,566
Please take it, Madam.

412
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:48,711
A tip!?

413
00:43:48,815 --> 00:43:50,510
Madam!
What is it?

414
00:44:22,682 --> 00:44:25,913
I like it a lot. Come on,
let's go and tell Baby.

415
00:44:26,052 --> 00:44:27,110
What're you doing here?

416
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,212
Look at the dress.
It's so beautiful.

417
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:33,348
It's a beautiful dress.
It'll look good on you.

418
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,758
Shall I buy it?
Yes.

419
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,892
Yes?
Yes.

420
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:41,429
Wait here. I'll be back.

421
00:44:49,943 --> 00:44:52,969
Baby liked it at first sight.

422
00:44:53,179 --> 00:44:55,511
Where's Madam?
She's ours.

423
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:57,607
Why should you be bothered?

424
00:45:03,857 --> 00:45:06,052
You hit me?

425
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:41,288
How do you find my dress?

426
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,570
Looks like Raja didn't
like my dress.

427
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:01,210
Shall I tell you the truth?
Yes.

428
00:46:01,848 --> 00:46:05,284
I didn't like this dress at all.
I suggest you change it immediately.

429
00:46:05,785 --> 00:46:07,412
It's not nice.
This boy is naive.

430
00:46:07,687 --> 00:46:10,349
What'd he know about fashion?
Don't pay attention to him.

431
00:46:10,557 --> 00:46:12,184
Let's go and do some
shopping instead.

432
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:14,390
Come on...

433
00:46:16,796 --> 00:46:21,859
You think a lot. My
dress is very nice.

434
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:00,566
O sweetheart!

435
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:06,040
It's so tiny!

436
00:47:06,245 --> 00:47:09,146
Even if you didn't wear it,
you would've looked prettier.

437
00:47:09,515 --> 00:47:11,346
What is it?

438
00:47:12,118 --> 00:47:13,847
Let them say what they want to.

439
00:47:14,153 --> 00:47:19,284
You're quite a dish!

440
00:47:20,193 --> 00:47:22,559
Hey!
Didn't I tell you?

441
00:47:22,862 --> 00:47:24,853
O sweetheart! Are you joining us?

442
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:30,195
If you aren't coming,
I'll come over.

443
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:34,035
You're so delicious!

444
00:49:02,995 --> 00:49:05,463
What were you saying?

445
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:20,044
Scoundrel! How dare you
try to attack Raja!

446
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,274
How dare you confront Boss!

447
00:49:31,124 --> 00:49:33,354
Don't!

448
00:49:34,227 --> 00:49:37,025
Leave him!

449
00:49:48,474 --> 00:49:50,942
Will you kill him?

450
00:50:11,764 --> 00:50:13,664
What does he think ofhimself?.

451
00:50:13,699 --> 00:50:17,465
Let him come. I'll deal
with him properly.

452
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:19,366
Yes, Madam...

453
00:50:21,774 --> 00:50:24,265
I see..so you've come?

454
00:50:25,545 --> 00:50:27,775
Why did you have to
create such a scene?

455
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,244
Why did you indulge in
so much of violence?

456
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:33,051
You made a scene for
such a small thing.

457
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:35,315
You call it something small.

458
00:50:35,621 --> 00:50:38,749
Those scoundrels were teasing you,
abusing you...

459
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:41,520
and you call it a small thing.
So what?

460
00:50:42,228 --> 00:50:45,356
Barking dogs can't be helped.
You should've ignored them.

461
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:47,632
This is a common occurrence
in the cities.

462
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:50,131
It must be happening in
the cities, not here.

463
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:53,568
This is Palankhet. Womenfolk
here are treated with respect.

464
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:55,206
And those who don't know
how to respect...

465
00:50:55,341 --> 00:50:58,071
are kicked several times and
taught how one should respect.

466
00:50:58,678 --> 00:51:02,170
I see...so you've taken it
upon yourself to reform society!

467
00:51:02,315 --> 00:51:04,579
Has the government awarded
you a contract to do this?

468
00:51:04,817 --> 00:51:06,614
How strange! I beat them up
for your sake...

469
00:51:06,752 --> 00:51:08,219
..and you're scolding me!

470
00:51:08,654 --> 00:51:09,882
Listen to one more thing.

471
00:51:10,022 --> 00:51:13,048
I don't like it at all
when you wear such dresses.

472
00:51:18,698 --> 00:51:21,963
Who're you to tell me what I should
wear and what I shouldn't?

473
00:51:22,268 --> 00:51:24,259
Who're you?

474
00:51:24,437 --> 00:51:28,271
I'll do and wear as
I please. Understand?

475
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:37,405
Yes...who am I to
tell you anything?

476
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,348
You can do as you please.

477
00:51:41,153 --> 00:51:43,314
And I'll do whatever
I find appropriate.

478
00:51:43,656 --> 00:51:47,888
Wear whatever you like, and I'll
keep on bashing up people.

479
00:51:48,427 --> 00:51:51,362
Today I've just broken theirl limbs.
Tomorrow I'll break theirl heads.

480
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:58,035
I am not scared of anybody.
I'm not even scared of you.

481
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:01,299
Yes. I'm not scared of you!

482
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:10,441
You're searching for Raja?

483
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,440
I know where you can find him.

484
00:53:13,612 --> 00:53:15,102
Where is he?

485
00:53:16,382 --> 00:53:19,010
You'll find him
in his own house.

486
00:53:19,518 --> 00:53:21,349
His house?

487
00:53:39,538 --> 00:53:41,199
Shall I come in?

488
00:53:41,574 --> 00:53:44,771
Who told you about this place?
Aunty did.

489
00:53:45,678 --> 00:53:50,308
Aunty has told me everything.
This is your home, isn't it?

490
00:53:51,517 --> 00:53:53,382
The unfulfilled dream
of your parents...

491
00:53:53,986 --> 00:53:56,079
It's very pretty.

492
00:53:56,589 --> 00:53:59,422
Why have you come here?
To ask for your forgiveness.

493
00:54:01,027 --> 00:54:04,019
I spoke a lot of nonsense yesterday
in a fit of anger.

494
00:54:04,463 --> 00:54:06,055
Please forgive me.

495
00:54:07,066 --> 00:54:10,832
Who am I to forgive you?
What right do I have on you?

496
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,736
You're very angry, aren't you?

497
00:54:13,906 --> 00:54:16,238
All right. Look...I'm
even holding my ears.

498
00:54:16,509 --> 00:54:18,568
Please forgive me now.

499
00:54:20,146 --> 00:54:25,550
Look...if you don't forgive me
right away, I'll start crying.

500
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:30,282
Very well...I forgive you.

501
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:34,848
Hey! You were so angry at me
just a while ago.

502
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:39,430
And you pardoned me so quickly.
What does it mean?

503
00:54:40,132 --> 00:54:42,396
I cannot see anybody crying.

504
00:54:42,635 --> 00:54:45,103
If somebody weeps, I too
start weeping.

505
00:54:51,844 --> 00:54:53,141
What does it mean?

506
00:54:54,013 --> 00:54:56,277
It means...you're a darling.

507
00:54:58,284 --> 00:55:02,084
Madam...do you know who is
addressed as a darling?

508
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:05,949
Yes, of course...one who
is close to the heart.

509
00:55:06,392 --> 00:55:10,761
One who is dear, and one
who is the best friend.

510
00:55:12,665 --> 00:55:14,098
Am I?
Yes.

511
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,190
Me, Madam?
Yes.

512
00:55:17,269 --> 00:55:19,533
I'm your best friend?
Gosh!

513
00:55:19,705 --> 00:55:21,502
Stop talking now,
and let's move.

514
00:55:21,874 --> 00:55:26,277
I've decided to see the
whole of Palankhet today.

515
00:55:26,479 --> 00:55:29,676
Will you show me around?
Sure, Madam.

516
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:31,874
I'll show you the heavens today.

517
00:55:37,256 --> 00:55:38,951
Please come.

518
00:55:39,158 --> 00:55:42,218
Shall I open my eyes?
No, not now. Just a minute.

519
00:55:42,695 --> 00:55:45,721
Where have you brought me?
Please keep walking.

520
00:55:46,365 --> 00:55:48,629
Shall I open my eyes?

521
00:55:49,268 --> 00:55:51,236
Yes. Open it now.

522
00:56:05,184 --> 00:56:07,118
It's such a beautiful place.

523
00:56:07,153 --> 00:56:11,249
Isn't it beautiful? I knew that
you'd like this place a lot.

524
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:14,926
Come on...be seated here.

525
00:56:19,431 --> 00:56:20,989
It's such a nice place.

526
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:24,802
It must be here that my
parents had first met.

527
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,628
What did you say?

528
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:35,245
Do you know...my mother and father
first met at Palankhet.

529
00:56:35,447 --> 00:56:37,472
Your mother..? How is your mother?

530
00:56:39,051 --> 00:56:43,511
She isn't alive. She passed away
soon after I was born.

531
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:45,782
Amazing! You don't have a mother.
I have no mother too.

532
00:56:45,858 --> 00:56:47,621
Both are same.

533
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,123
Pardon me for blabbering like this.
I say anything that comes to my mind.

534
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:55,392
It's a problem. I don't
know how to converse.

535
00:56:56,001 --> 00:56:57,969
Who says that you cannot converse?

536
00:56:58,137 --> 00:57:02,198
You talk very well.
Really?

537
00:57:06,512 --> 00:57:11,040
Madam...I just talk beautifully.
But you're beautiful too.

538
00:57:12,518 --> 00:57:14,509
Me?
Yes. You're very beautiful.

539
00:57:15,487 --> 00:57:18,354
You too make a lot of
insincere praises.

540
00:57:18,524 --> 00:57:23,461
I swear...I haven't seen anybody
more beautiful than you are.

541
00:57:24,296 --> 00:57:28,357
Why? What's so
beautiful about me ?

542
00:57:28,634 --> 00:57:30,659
Everything about you is beautiful.

543
00:57:30,703 --> 00:57:31,795
Your hairl...

544
00:57:33,272 --> 00:57:34,398
It's nothing special.

545
00:57:34,707 --> 00:57:38,404
Your eyes.
My eyes..?

546
00:57:42,514 --> 00:57:44,038
Come a bit closer.

547
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,487
What's so special
about my eyes?

548
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,255
Your eyes...
Yes..my eyes?

549
00:57:54,693 --> 00:57:57,821
Your eyes...
Come on. Tell me...

550
00:57:57,963 --> 00:58:01,126
What's so special
about my eyes?

551
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:03,633
Your eyes are like the
headlight of a taxi-cab.

552
00:58:03,802 --> 00:58:05,292
What?

553
00:58:15,848 --> 00:58:18,112
You're an idiot! A clown!

554
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,514
But madam! I don't know
poetry. What could I do?

555
00:58:20,586 --> 00:58:24,022
I'm telling you the truth.
No one is more beautiful than you.

556
00:58:24,156 --> 00:58:27,216
That's enough. If somebody hears
you, he'll have a nice laugh.

557
00:58:27,259 --> 00:58:29,693
I'm not scared of anybody.
I'll tell everybody.

558
00:58:29,828 --> 00:58:32,797
This sky...these clouds...
these mountains...

559
00:58:32,965 --> 00:58:36,958
Madam is very beautiful.

560
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,769
Madam is the most beautiful.

561
01:05:08,827 --> 01:05:11,694
Be careful, Madam. Hurry up...

562
01:05:46,998 --> 01:05:48,192
Hey!

563
01:05:49,935 --> 01:05:53,200
What're you doing? Why're you
drenching yourself in the rain?

564
01:05:53,672 --> 01:05:55,162
Come here...under the tree.

565
01:05:56,241 --> 01:05:57,265
No, Madam.

566
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:02,437
Are you mad? You'll fall sick.
You'll catch fever. Come here.

567
01:06:04,116 --> 01:06:05,640
I'm fine here.

568
01:06:07,753 --> 01:06:12,452
Look...if you don't come here
rightaway, I'll come out there.

569
01:06:12,591 --> 01:06:15,321
No, Madam.
Then come over.

570
01:06:18,029 --> 01:06:21,157
Come...come!

571
01:06:33,445 --> 01:06:36,141
Give me your hand. Come on!

572
01:06:57,169 --> 01:07:00,832
I'm very scared of lightening.

573
01:07:03,475 --> 01:07:06,035
I'm such a fool, aren't I?

574
01:08:43,275 --> 01:08:45,869
No...

575
01:09:10,035 --> 01:09:11,263
No!

576
01:10:14,165 --> 01:10:17,293
Those idiots must've told you
that Daddy has come, did they?

577
01:10:17,635 --> 01:10:18,795
And you...

578
01:10:19,571 --> 01:10:23,166
..came rushing through the storm
and the rains to meet your father?

579
01:10:23,675 --> 01:10:25,074
Yes...

580
01:10:27,379 --> 01:10:30,837
I've come to meet you, my child.

581
01:10:35,487 --> 01:10:37,614
I've come to meet you
straight from Germany.

582
01:10:37,822 --> 01:10:40,723
I haven't even been home.
We'll go together now.

583
01:10:40,892 --> 01:10:42,291
I'll take you back.

584
01:10:44,195 --> 01:10:45,685
Back?
Yes. Back...

585
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:02,804
Where had you been?

586
01:11:03,048 --> 01:11:04,913
I was in the storm.

587
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:06,617
It's nice that you've come.

588
01:11:06,818 --> 01:11:09,514
Take out the taxi quickly.
Your madam is leaving.

589
01:11:12,323 --> 01:11:15,349
Madam is leaving.
Yes.

590
01:11:15,427 --> 01:11:17,861
Her father has come to take her.
She has to leave tonight itself.

591
01:11:17,996 --> 01:11:20,055
They've to board
the morning flight.

592
01:11:20,098 --> 01:11:22,794
What're you still standing for?
Get the car out quickly.

593
01:11:46,925 --> 01:11:49,359
Come on...keep it.

594
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:57,292
What're you saying? After all,
your daughter is our daughter.

595
01:11:58,837 --> 01:12:01,704
You've taken care
of Aarti so well.

596
01:12:01,973 --> 01:12:03,600
Many, many thanks to you!

597
01:12:24,129 --> 01:12:26,927
Always remain just
as you are:

598
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:35,198
I'm leaving, Aunty.

599
01:12:35,507 --> 01:12:40,945
No. Never say you're leaving.
Say that you'll return.

600
01:12:47,552 --> 01:12:48,883
Shall we leave?

601
01:12:55,426 --> 01:12:58,827
Hey! You're wearing dark
sunglasses in the night?

602
01:12:58,997 --> 01:13:00,328
What's wrong?

603
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:06,132
Something is hurting my eyes.

604
01:13:07,906 --> 01:13:11,637
It must be a particle of dust.
It'll come out by itself.

605
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,744
Let's leave, Driver.

606
01:13:17,382 --> 01:13:18,815
Come on...

607
01:13:20,785 --> 01:13:22,650
Come on...we've to reach
the airport, after all.

608
01:13:22,854 --> 01:13:24,321
Come on...be seated.

609
01:13:35,366 --> 01:13:36,731
Poor Raja!

610
01:13:48,646 --> 01:13:50,307
What did you do all these days?

611
01:13:51,082 --> 01:13:52,845
Nothing special.

612
01:13:54,852 --> 01:13:58,413
My daughter is not in a mood
to talk to me.

613
01:13:58,623 --> 01:14:00,921
Anyhow, I'll speak
to somebody else.

614
01:14:02,093 --> 01:14:04,561
What's your name, driver?

615
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:11,597
Wow! That's a nice name.

616
01:14:12,237 --> 01:14:15,035
Once you hear such a name, it
can't be forgotten for a lifetime.

617
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,771
How much do you manage to earn?

618
01:14:17,976 --> 01:14:19,807
It depends on the person.

619
01:14:20,345 --> 01:14:23,746
Some give me a lot.
Some give nothing.

620
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:27,247
You speak well.

621
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:29,743
You drive quite well too.

622
01:14:30,755 --> 01:14:33,724
By the way, there's a scarcity
of drivers in Mumbai.

623
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:36,150
Why don't you work with us?

624
01:14:36,194 --> 01:14:39,686
We'll pay you a good salary.
And give you a room to live in.

625
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:40,789
What say, Aarti?

626
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:45,030
No, Sirl. I'm fine here.

627
01:14:45,803 --> 01:14:50,001
Why? What's the matter?
Are you married?

628
01:14:52,277 --> 01:14:54,643
No, Sirl.
Why not?

629
01:14:57,915 --> 01:14:59,974
I haven't yet got
what I desirled.

630
01:15:04,122 --> 01:15:08,286
How strange! You people
live in a dream world.

631
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:11,654
As if some dream girll is
going to come.

632
01:15:11,796 --> 01:15:15,459
Why not, Sirl? She'll come someday.

633
01:15:16,034 --> 01:15:18,764
A dream girll will
surely come for me.

634
01:15:20,538 --> 01:15:21,562
Hey!

635
01:15:21,873 --> 01:15:24,068
What's this traffic jam for?

636
01:15:34,352 --> 01:15:41,349
Hey! Raja! My dear! Tell me...
where are you going?

637
01:15:42,026 --> 01:15:43,926
Where are you going?

638
01:15:45,029 --> 01:15:47,793
O Madam! How're you, Madam?

639
01:15:48,066 --> 01:15:51,627
Who's he?
He's Balwant Singh.

640
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:54,600
He's my father.

641
01:15:55,573 --> 01:15:57,131
Greetings! How're you?

642
01:15:58,176 --> 01:15:59,336
Why this traffic jam?

643
01:15:59,477 --> 01:16:05,347
The traffic jam has been
caused because of a landslide.

644
01:16:05,516 --> 01:16:07,746
But we've to reach the
airport by morning!

645
01:16:08,019 --> 01:16:09,884
No problem. It won't take
longer than a couple ofhours.

646
01:16:10,054 --> 01:16:13,717
But why don't you have some food
at the eatingjoint close-by?

647
01:16:13,825 --> 01:16:20,389
Why don't you take them along?
We'll treat them to refreshments.

648
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:37,534
How wonderful!

649
01:22:37,908 --> 01:22:41,139
There's so much feeling
in your voice!

650
01:22:43,781 --> 01:22:49,481
It's said that when a heart breaks,
it makes no sound.

651
01:22:50,654 --> 01:22:56,786
But when it breaks,
it causes havoc.

652
01:22:58,429 --> 01:23:05,062
There's anguish in your voice.
There's that love in your voice.

653
01:23:06,437 --> 01:23:07,335
But listen...

654
01:23:08,139 --> 01:23:11,404
The people in the world
around you...

655
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:15,136
..won't do justice to
your pain and your love.

656
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,545
You'll be left trembling.
You'll keep singing.

657
01:23:19,784 --> 01:23:22,082
And this world will
just stand and stare.

658
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:25,616
Listen...you continue to sing.

659
01:23:25,723 --> 01:23:30,126
And today...after a long time...
I'll dance wholeheartedly.

660
01:23:40,337 --> 01:23:44,569
''Do not go away, O traveller''

661
01:23:45,676 --> 01:23:49,840
''Do not leave me''

662
01:23:50,481 --> 01:23:55,077
''You are my love, O traveller...''

663
01:23:58,622 --> 01:24:01,614
''honour your word''

664
01:24:10,868 --> 01:24:13,598
''You must return''

665
01:24:16,373 --> 01:24:22,471
''Remember, I'm here...forget me not''

666
01:25:56,707 --> 01:26:01,041
Our Aarti will never marry
your Raja taxi-driver.

667
01:26:01,178 --> 01:26:03,408
Don't you speak
bad things.

668
01:26:03,514 --> 01:26:05,311
If I weren't fond of you...

669
01:26:05,482 --> 01:26:09,316
..I would've ensured that
you were dealt with properly.

670
01:26:10,621 --> 01:26:13,146
You'd better hold back
your breath.

671
01:26:13,357 --> 01:26:15,552
You will need it to
extinguish the lamps.

672
01:26:15,659 --> 01:26:17,320
This marriage will never
take place.

673
01:26:17,494 --> 01:26:19,587
It'll take place.
It won't take place.

674
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:22,924
Why not?
It won't take place.

675
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:24,727
Let's bet on it.
All right.

676
01:26:24,935 --> 01:26:26,960
Let's put our arms on trial.

677
01:26:27,471 --> 01:26:29,439
Come on...

678
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:33,804
I'm asking you once again.

679
01:26:34,445 --> 01:26:38,074
Lovers hold hands firmly.
They don't leave it.

680
01:26:38,849 --> 01:26:40,942
Let's get down to
the confrontation.

681
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:44,018
Is it? Here it is.
Come on...

682
01:26:51,462 --> 01:26:52,554
It's so warm.

683
01:26:53,564 --> 01:26:55,498
It's so warm!

684
01:27:01,271 --> 01:27:04,331
You lost!
Shut up, will you?

685
01:27:04,775 --> 01:27:06,800
You indulge in cheating?

686
01:27:07,344 --> 01:27:10,541
You show me your Doordarshan
and ruin my Star TV.

687
01:27:11,415 --> 01:27:13,007
Why did you unbutton your dress?

688
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:15,682
I was feeling hot.
So I unbuttoned it.

689
01:27:15,853 --> 01:27:20,153
What if I did unbutton my shirt?
Wouldn't I have felt hot then?

690
01:27:20,858 --> 01:27:25,557
Don't scream. If that's the
case, let's compete once again.

691
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:27,296
I'll win again.

692
01:27:27,798 --> 01:27:28,924
You're too confident.
Yes.

693
01:27:29,099 --> 01:27:31,659
All right. This contest
will be a different one.

694
01:27:31,869 --> 01:27:33,461
What's that?

695
01:27:34,938 --> 01:27:37,202
Are you willing to wrestle?
Wrestle?

696
01:27:38,275 --> 01:27:40,300
You got scared, didn't you?

697
01:27:41,779 --> 01:27:44,304
I'm not scared. I'm not
scared of anybody.

698
01:27:44,815 --> 01:27:46,840
Then how about a bout?
All right.

699
01:27:47,584 --> 01:27:48,812
Let's go then.

700
01:27:48,886 --> 01:27:50,410
Come on!

701
01:27:59,129 --> 01:28:00,858
Come on, Balwant!

702
01:28:20,117 --> 01:28:21,448
Leave me.

703
01:28:21,919 --> 01:28:23,648
You have lost, haven't you?
Yes.

704
01:28:23,954 --> 01:28:25,683
Will you become a girll now?

705
01:28:26,223 --> 01:28:28,316
All right.
Will you marry me?

706
01:28:29,093 --> 01:28:30,788
I will. Leave me now.

707
01:28:38,936 --> 01:28:41,905
You'll get married.
You'll surely get married.

708
01:28:49,813 --> 01:28:52,077
Aarti has made her decision.

709
01:28:53,317 --> 01:28:57,310
And perhaps you're waiting
for my decision.

710
01:28:59,289 --> 01:29:03,783
For the sake of my daughter's
happiness, I've agreed to her.

711
01:29:05,662 --> 01:29:09,598
But before this marriage,
I've some conditions.

712
01:29:13,804 --> 01:29:16,034
Aarti will not live here.

713
01:29:17,007 --> 01:29:21,171
And you'll have to live
with us in Mumbai.

714
01:29:22,513 --> 01:29:26,381
You'll mould yourself
in our ways.

715
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:30,577
You'll learn the etiquette
of our society...

716
01:29:31,054 --> 01:29:35,457
..and you'll do only that
which you're asked to.

717
01:29:35,659 --> 01:29:37,820
Not at all.
What?

718
01:29:37,861 --> 01:29:39,988
Neither will I come to Mumbai...

719
01:29:40,264 --> 01:29:43,028
..nor will I learn the
etiquette of your society.

720
01:29:43,867 --> 01:29:46,495
And nor will I become
what you want to make me.

721
01:29:47,638 --> 01:29:51,438
I am just like I am now.
And I'll remain like this.

722
01:29:52,075 --> 01:29:57,069
Did you hear? What I want to make
him, and what he wants to remain?

723
01:29:57,714 --> 01:30:01,343
Yes...are you listening?

724
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:08,591
And listen carefully...because
I'll remain just like I am.

725
01:30:09,493 --> 01:30:11,893
I won't change for anybody.

726
01:30:12,763 --> 01:30:15,231
If you want to accept me
despite all this...

727
01:30:17,467 --> 01:30:21,961
..this is the time
for you to decide.

728
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:34,506
You're leaving, Aarti?

729
01:30:35,519 --> 01:30:38,613
You're leaving your father?

730
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:46,690
You'd learned to take your first
step with my assistance.

731
01:30:48,098 --> 01:30:53,263
And today, you're taking away
those very steps away from me?

732
01:30:55,005 --> 01:30:58,304
Don't go...come back.

733
01:31:20,264 --> 01:31:22,926
This is my place from today.

734
01:31:24,768 --> 01:31:26,702
Bless us.

735
01:31:27,604 --> 01:31:28,969
Bless you?

736
01:31:29,473 --> 01:31:31,998
I cannot bless this
mistake of yours.

737
01:31:32,209 --> 01:31:34,803
Your marriage will never succeed.

738
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:41,242
You'll never remain happy
by staying away from me.

739
01:31:41,618 --> 01:31:43,245
Gulab and Kamal...let's leave.

740
01:31:43,553 --> 01:31:45,043
Yes?

741
01:31:45,222 --> 01:31:51,058
I too will stay here. My marriage
has been finalised with Balwant.

742
01:31:51,528 --> 01:31:53,393
Marriage with Balwant?

743
01:31:53,864 --> 01:31:57,493
And you, have you fallen in
love with somebody too?

744
01:31:57,934 --> 01:31:59,902
Yes, I've fallen in love too.

745
01:32:00,337 --> 01:32:02,498
I've fallen in love
with all these lovers.

746
01:32:02,739 --> 01:32:06,231
Henceforth, I'll live in this river
of love. I won't go away from here.

747
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:08,910
All of you have turned
crazy about love.

748
01:32:09,012 --> 01:32:12,038
You'll die because of
the illusion of love.

749
01:32:12,115 --> 01:32:13,582
Come on...

750
01:32:20,891 --> 01:32:21,915
No, my daughter...

751
01:32:22,659 --> 01:32:26,220
Father didn't even bless me!

752
01:32:26,363 --> 01:32:28,456
So what?

753
01:32:29,366 --> 01:32:31,197
We'll bless you.

754
01:32:31,501 --> 01:32:35,028
Perhaps God kept us childless...

755
01:32:35,205 --> 01:32:37,935
..so that we may get you married.

756
01:32:38,642 --> 01:32:40,041
Yes, my child...

757
01:33:07,237 --> 01:33:12,732
''You are the spring in my life''

758
01:33:27,557 --> 01:33:32,017
''Live in my heart forever...as my love''

759
01:33:49,212 --> 01:33:59,053
''You linger in my dreams...
a thousand pleasant ones''

760
01:33:59,523 --> 01:34:10,024
''Live in my heart. Always. As love would''

761
01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:25,907
I'd never imagined that my only
daughter would revolt against me.

762
01:34:26,383 --> 01:34:28,908
That she would insult me like this.

763
01:34:28,985 --> 01:34:32,284
That too for a tourist guide,
a taxi driver?

764
01:34:32,489 --> 01:34:34,980
No. This marriage can
never take place.

765
01:34:35,225 --> 01:34:38,456
If she's stubborn,
I'm also no less.

766
01:34:38,662 --> 01:34:40,687
I'll disinherit her
from my property.

767
01:34:41,244 --> 01:34:43,804
I won't bequeath her anything.

768
01:34:54,757 --> 01:35:01,321
''Like this, my love,
always be at my side''

769
01:35:10,139 --> 01:35:16,009
''They will show theirl true colours;
but you mustn't change''

770
01:38:10,119 --> 01:38:15,216
No, I cannot sign these papers.
I can never disinherit my daughter.

771
01:38:15,992 --> 01:38:18,017
Neither from my property,
nor from my heart.

772
01:38:18,294 --> 01:38:21,730
But listen...you've prepared these
documents yourselves.

773
01:38:21,797 --> 01:38:24,391
She's a part and parcel
of my heart.

774
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,727
How can I separate her?
But her behaviour with you...

775
01:38:26,769 --> 01:38:28,259
She might've done
anything with me.

776
01:38:28,437 --> 01:38:30,029
But, after all, she's my
progeny, and I'm her father.

777
01:38:30,339 --> 01:38:32,273
She might punish me as severely
as she likes...

778
01:38:32,475 --> 01:38:34,500
..and I cannot punish
her even slightly.

779
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:36,974
She might forget me,
but I can never forget her.

780
01:38:37,179 --> 01:38:38,373
I'm going to meet her.
Where?

781
01:38:38,681 --> 01:38:41,309
To her new home.
I'll accompany you too.

782
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:42,681
You?

783
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:46,555
After all, I'm her mother too.

784
01:38:46,589 --> 01:38:50,025
So what if I'm her stepmother?
Do I not feel like meeting her?

785
01:38:51,027 --> 01:38:52,688
All right. Come along.

786
01:38:55,765 --> 01:38:57,289
Brother, what's happening?

787
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,261
Relax, Sister.

788
01:39:03,039 --> 01:39:05,507
Brother, this...
It doesn't matter, Sister.

789
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:08,273
You too are a mother, so what
if you're her step mother?

790
01:39:08,344 --> 01:39:10,869
You too are dying to meet her,
aren't you?

791
01:39:10,913 --> 01:39:11,845
Yes.

792
01:39:12,181 --> 01:39:17,517
Go...meet...look...understand.

793
01:39:40,443 --> 01:39:42,172
Father!

794
01:40:46,342 --> 01:40:48,435
Father! Wait!

795
01:40:52,715 --> 01:40:55,548
You were so delayed.
We'd been waiting for so long.

796
01:40:55,751 --> 01:40:58,185
Do you know who had come?
Who had come?

797
01:40:58,487 --> 01:41:01,422
Father! Father had come here.

798
01:41:01,724 --> 01:41:06,388
He has accepted our alliance.
I'm so happy today!

799
01:41:09,798 --> 01:41:13,290
But he didn't wait...to meet me?

800
01:41:14,937 --> 01:41:18,236
He had waited. But you
were so delayed!

801
01:41:18,407 --> 01:41:21,137
And he had to take
the evening flight too.

802
01:41:21,911 --> 01:41:23,503
Come on...
Where?

803
01:41:23,779 --> 01:41:27,271
I want to show you
something. Come on.

804
01:41:28,817 --> 01:41:30,910
Come on...hurry up!

805
01:41:37,493 --> 01:41:39,017
Which place is this?

806
01:41:40,829 --> 01:41:42,319
Whose house is this?

807
01:41:43,232 --> 01:41:44,597
It's ours.

808
01:41:45,401 --> 01:41:46,959
Ours?
Yes.

809
01:41:48,137 --> 01:41:50,230
This is our palace.

810
01:41:51,407 --> 01:41:55,776
You're the King of this palace.
And I'm the Queen of this palace.

811
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:01,340
How did you find it?
I don't understand.

812
01:42:02,017 --> 01:42:06,613
Fool! Father has given it to us
as a marriage gift.

813
01:42:08,557 --> 01:42:11,526
And you accepted it?
Without asking me? Why?

814
01:42:13,195 --> 01:42:15,755
Why do you have to be angry?

815
01:42:15,965 --> 01:42:18,490
Every father gifts something
to his daughter.

816
01:42:18,667 --> 01:42:22,262
I don't regret his giving.
I regret your accepting it.

817
01:42:22,871 --> 01:42:27,467
My self-respect...all my good
qualities which you were in awe of...

818
01:42:27,509 --> 01:42:30,478
..you compromised on
it today so swiftly?

819
01:42:31,614 --> 01:42:34,082
You want all these
comforts, don't you?

820
01:42:34,483 --> 01:42:36,576
Give me some time.

821
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,313
I'll slog day and night
and get everything for you.

822
01:42:39,488 --> 01:42:41,217
You're misunderstanding me.

823
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:44,951
I want all this for you,
not for myself.

824
01:42:46,729 --> 01:42:51,166
I want you to get all the
happiness and comfort.

825
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:53,028
You want me happy, don't you?
Yes.

826
01:42:53,335 --> 01:42:54,962
Then return this gift
to your father.

827
01:42:55,237 --> 01:42:58,172
And henceforth, never accept
any help or gift...

828
01:42:58,207 --> 01:43:02,303
..from any of your family
members. Understand?

829
01:43:02,478 --> 01:43:04,605
But why?
Why?

830
01:43:05,014 --> 01:43:07,608
Because when two people
of equal status...

831
01:43:07,816 --> 01:43:09,807
..gift each other something,
that's called a gift.

832
01:43:09,918 --> 01:43:12,716
But when a rich person gifts
something to a poor person...

833
01:43:12,921 --> 01:43:16,584
..it's considered to be
help, an alm.

834
01:43:17,493 --> 01:43:19,961
And Raja doesn't accept
alms from anybody.

835
01:43:20,162 --> 01:43:22,460
Enough of it. Let's go from here.

836
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:26,128
Come on.

837
01:43:27,036 --> 01:43:28,833
I won't go.
All right then.

838
01:43:29,238 --> 01:43:31,968
You may stay here.
I'll send your belongings here.

839
01:43:32,107 --> 01:43:34,268
I'm going. You may stay here.

840
01:43:50,559 --> 01:43:52,652
You're going away from me?

841
01:43:53,329 --> 01:43:56,093
I gave up the whole world
for your sake.

842
01:43:56,298 --> 01:44:00,428
I sacrificed everything. And you
are leaving me today?What do you think of yourself?.

843
01:44:00,636 --> 01:44:06,506
You're a man. So you can
leave me any time you like?

844
01:44:07,242 --> 01:44:11,440
But where should I go?
Where should I go?

845
01:44:12,047 --> 01:44:14,743
When I stepped into your life...

846
01:44:14,950 --> 01:44:18,943
..I shut all the doors
which led me back.

847
01:44:19,121 --> 01:44:23,148
Now I don't have any other door
except yours...

848
01:44:23,826 --> 01:44:25,555
..or my other choice is death.

849
01:44:27,029 --> 01:44:29,327
Where am I leaving you?

850
01:44:29,531 --> 01:44:33,433
I'm not leaving you.
I'm not going anywhere.

851
01:44:38,774 --> 01:44:41,504
Please forgive me.

852
01:44:41,643 --> 01:44:43,941
I've said a lot of undesirlable
things to you out of anger.

853
01:44:43,979 --> 01:44:46,209
Please forgive me.

854
01:44:46,448 --> 01:44:50,544
But I cannot live in that house.

855
01:44:53,655 --> 01:44:56,818
I can sacrifice a hundred such
homes for your sake.

856
01:44:57,893 --> 01:45:00,919
But listen to me attentively.

857
01:45:02,231 --> 01:45:05,462
If you ever talk of
leaving me again...

858
01:45:06,068 --> 01:45:08,696
..I'll commit suicide.

859
01:45:09,071 --> 01:45:10,834
What're you saying?

860
01:45:14,143 --> 01:45:16,270
You love me so much?

861
01:45:17,379 --> 01:45:19,370
You can test it.

862
01:45:19,782 --> 01:45:22,751
Forgive me, Madam. I haven't
yet tested your love...

863
01:45:22,885 --> 01:45:24,477
..and I've already taken
so much ofbeating.

864
01:45:24,686 --> 01:45:27,280
What'll people in Palankhet say?
That Raja is bashed by his wife?

865
01:45:27,956 --> 01:45:30,424
Hush! Why do you lie?

866
01:45:31,293 --> 01:45:33,659
Where did I hit you?
Is it?

867
01:45:34,096 --> 01:45:36,462
I was just annoyed a bit.

868
01:45:37,132 --> 01:45:39,930
A bit annoyed?
What could I do?

869
01:45:40,669 --> 01:45:44,332
Whenever I become angry, I wonder
what happens to me.

870
01:45:44,506 --> 01:45:49,341
Henceforth whenever I misbehave,
you may slap me twice.

871
01:45:49,878 --> 01:45:52,642
Is it? Think it over.
I've thought it over.

872
01:45:54,383 --> 01:45:56,317
One more slap is still pending.

873
01:46:07,296 --> 01:46:08,320
Gosh!

874
01:46:10,332 --> 01:46:12,493
What happened?

875
01:46:13,335 --> 01:46:15,132
What happened?

876
01:46:16,138 --> 01:46:17,935
What happened to her?

877
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:24,470
What's happened to her?

878
01:46:25,047 --> 01:46:28,847
What did you do to her?
Nothing. I just slapped her once.

879
01:46:29,318 --> 01:46:32,685
Just once? It's all right then.
You men are all alike.

880
01:46:32,754 --> 01:46:35,018
To hell with you!

881
01:46:36,258 --> 01:46:38,920
Say something. What's
happened to you?

882
01:52:51,833 --> 01:52:53,664
Sister!
O brother!

883
01:52:53,869 --> 01:52:55,461
You've scared me needlessly.

884
01:52:55,670 --> 01:52:58,230
You'd better get scared. It will
be in your interest.

885
01:52:58,373 --> 01:53:03,310
Otherwise you would be
at the receiving end.

886
01:53:03,945 --> 01:53:04,775
Why?

887
01:53:05,113 --> 01:53:07,638
The father and daughter are related
to each other in blood.

888
01:53:07,816 --> 01:53:10,011
And it can never be severed.

889
01:53:10,518 --> 01:53:13,316
Today, brother-in-law has only
willed the house in her name.

890
01:53:13,355 --> 01:53:14,845
Tomorrow, he may transfer
the entirle property.

891
01:53:15,056 --> 01:53:17,616
But her husband has already
returned the house.

892
01:53:17,826 --> 01:53:21,318
He has only returned the house.
But he won't return the property.

893
01:53:21,696 --> 01:53:25,792
After he dies, all property will
be transferred to Aarti's name.

894
01:53:25,901 --> 01:53:29,564
Then that taxi-driver
will reign over us.

895
01:53:29,604 --> 01:53:31,697
Then what should we do?

896
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,598
To kill the snake...

897
01:53:33,742 --> 01:53:36,233
..it's very necessary to make
the snake come out ofhis hole.

898
01:53:36,678 --> 01:53:40,580
Do something so that both
of them come here.

899
01:53:40,715 --> 01:53:45,675
Then I'll make such a move that even
the villains would be embarrassed.

900
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:51,315
No. I won't go to Mumbai.

901
01:53:51,426 --> 01:53:54,054
If you won't go,
I won't go too.

902
01:53:54,095 --> 01:53:56,586
But where am I preventing you?
Just look...

903
01:53:56,731 --> 01:53:59,359
Mother has written
such a loving letter.

904
01:53:59,501 --> 01:54:01,435
She wants that father and I should
celebrate our birthday together...

905
01:54:01,603 --> 01:54:04,504
..just like we do every year.

906
01:54:04,673 --> 01:54:07,198
Otherwise, Father will
feel very lonely.

907
01:54:07,375 --> 01:54:11,937
But I'll feel like
a stranger there.

908
01:54:12,247 --> 01:54:15,410
Why don't you go yourself?.
Without you?

909
01:54:16,017 --> 01:54:20,215
You want me to celebrate
my birthday in sorrow?

910
01:54:20,255 --> 01:54:23,190
No, but...
Then agree to come.

911
01:54:23,725 --> 01:54:26,592
It's a matter of only a few days.
Please agree to it.

912
01:54:30,999 --> 01:54:33,559
All right. I'll come to Mumbai.

913
01:54:48,049 --> 01:54:50,745
My home has come!

914
01:55:01,596 --> 01:55:05,191
You've come! Didn't I say that
Aarti will surely come?

915
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:08,563
Thank you for honouring
my request.

916
01:55:08,603 --> 01:55:11,572
Where's Father?
He's gone out.

917
01:55:11,806 --> 01:55:13,330
He must be returning.
Our daughter has come alone?

918
01:55:13,408 --> 01:55:15,968
Where's our son-in-law?

919
01:55:16,378 --> 01:55:20,246
Gosh! He's left behind.
I'll fetch him right away.

920
01:55:20,415 --> 01:55:24,442
All of us will come to greet him.
Let's us how our son-in-law is.

921
01:55:26,421 --> 01:55:30,118
You don't have change? Why not?
Why don't you keep loose change?

922
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:33,124
Forget it. After all, it's a matter
of only two-and-a-half rupees.

923
01:55:33,395 --> 01:55:35,420
Is two-and-a-half rupees
a small amount?

924
01:55:35,597 --> 01:55:39,089
Give back my note. I'll give you
the exact amount. Am I a fool?

925
01:55:40,068 --> 01:55:44,437
You live in such a huge bungalow and
you crib for two-and-a-half rupees?

926
01:55:44,773 --> 01:55:47,469
I don't live in this bungalow.
I live in Palankhet.

927
01:55:47,742 --> 01:55:49,767
Come on...give back my money.

928
01:55:50,378 --> 01:55:52,141
What happened? What's the matter?

929
01:55:52,447 --> 01:55:56,008
He's a strange fellow. The
fare is 47.50 rupees.

930
01:55:56,184 --> 01:55:58,675
I gave him a 50-rupee note.
Now I'm asking for 2.50 rupees...

931
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:00,449
and now he's arguing with me.
Let it be.

932
01:56:00,488 --> 01:56:02,012
It's a matter of two-and-a-half
rupees. Come on. Let's go.

933
01:56:02,057 --> 01:56:03,684
What do you mean?
Are you gone mad?

934
01:56:03,858 --> 01:56:06,656
It's my hard-earned money.
I too drive taxis.

935
01:56:06,828 --> 01:56:09,695
But I've never cheated anybody.
I account for every paisa.

936
01:56:09,731 --> 01:56:12,700
Come on. Give me my money.
Here...

937
01:56:12,834 --> 01:56:15,064
Take your two-and-a-half rupees and
stop your nonsense, you beggar.

938
01:56:16,204 --> 01:56:18,297
Whom did you call a beggar?

939
01:56:19,074 --> 01:56:21,975
Don't you hit me! Or
I'll contact the union!

940
01:56:23,445 --> 01:56:25,936
Scoundrel!
Take him away.

941
01:56:27,382 --> 01:56:29,873
You've got your money. Go now.
What do you mean? Is he mad?

942
01:56:30,385 --> 01:56:33,650
He quarrels for a couple of rupees.
He may kill for 5 rupees.

943
01:56:33,755 --> 01:56:36,724
Send him back to his village.
All right. We'll send him back.

944
01:56:36,891 --> 01:56:40,657
He's a quarrelsome person.
Calm down...calm down.

945
01:56:41,229 --> 01:56:45,495
Raja is very tirled. Take him inside.
Go and take rest.

946
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:48,592
Why did you have to...
Do you mean that I was wrong?

947
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:52,433
What kind of a person
did Aarti marry?

948
01:56:52,507 --> 01:56:57,171
She has married the right man.

949
01:56:57,679 --> 01:56:59,738
Didn't you see how much
angry he becomes?

950
01:57:00,215 --> 01:57:04,151
It's easy to instigate a person
who is so hot-tempered.

951
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:09,315
It doesn't take long
to light a fire.

952
01:57:31,779 --> 01:57:35,613
Hurry up.
The guests must've arrived.

953
01:57:39,687 --> 01:57:41,211
Yes?
May I come in?

954
01:57:41,289 --> 01:57:44,053
Yes, of course. Please come.

955
01:57:44,292 --> 01:57:47,318
Yes?
How should I tell you?

956
01:57:48,029 --> 01:57:50,589
I won't be able to tell you.
You may tell me.

957
01:57:52,867 --> 01:57:58,931
Dear...I too can have some desirles
and aspirlations, can I not?

958
01:57:59,174 --> 01:58:00,471
Yes, why not?

959
01:58:00,942 --> 01:58:05,538
I want Raja to wear this dress
in today's party.

960
01:58:05,813 --> 01:58:10,978
I've got it made myself. It would
look so good on Raja.

961
01:58:11,686 --> 01:58:13,950
But he...?
Why?

962
01:58:14,355 --> 01:58:19,520
Don't you want Raja to look the
most handsome in today's party?

963
01:58:20,161 --> 01:58:22,061
Yes.
Don't you?

964
01:58:22,697 --> 01:58:24,892
But why did you take
so much of trouble?

965
01:58:25,099 --> 01:58:30,696
Trouble? What's the trouble?
I'm your mother, after all.

966
01:58:32,173 --> 01:58:35,267
Who else do I have besides you?

967
01:58:36,311 --> 01:58:39,610
But don't tell Raja that I've
given it to you.

968
01:58:39,647 --> 01:58:43,083
Otherwise he won't wear it.
You know how Raja is!

969
01:58:43,318 --> 01:58:45,286
Then what should I tell him?

970
01:58:45,453 --> 01:58:50,083
Every wife knows how to
convince her husband.

971
01:58:50,525 --> 01:58:54,256
Ah, yes! Tell him that you've
bought this suit for him.

972
01:58:54,295 --> 01:58:57,059
It's one and the same thing whether
you buy it or I buy it.

973
01:58:57,098 --> 01:58:59,430
He'll agree if you ask him.

974
01:58:59,767 --> 01:59:02,201
All guests have arrived.

975
01:59:02,837 --> 01:59:04,771
Both of you...get ready.

976
01:59:04,806 --> 01:59:07,172
Get him to wear the
suit, all right?

977
01:59:34,736 --> 01:59:37,466
Gosh! Why did you sit down?
Get up!

978
01:59:37,705 --> 01:59:42,074
I'm unable to get myself to
attend this gathering.

979
01:59:42,243 --> 01:59:45,838
What? Don't talk about it now.
Just get up and get ready.

980
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:47,880
Hurry up...come on!

981
01:59:50,218 --> 01:59:53,187
You will wear this today?

982
01:59:54,222 --> 01:59:57,658
Yes. I thought of wearing
my wedding dress tonight.

983
01:59:58,293 --> 02:00:03,390
No...today you'll wear this.

984
02:00:04,532 --> 02:00:05,965
What is this?
It's a suit.

985
02:00:06,868 --> 02:00:09,393
You'll look handsome
if you wear it.

986
02:00:09,504 --> 02:00:11,131
Everybody at the party
will say that...

987
02:00:11,439 --> 02:00:13,805
..nobody is more beautiful
than Aarti's Raja.

988
02:00:14,142 --> 02:00:16,076
But where did it come from?

989
02:00:16,110 --> 02:00:20,911
I bought it.
But it must be very expensive.

990
02:00:21,115 --> 02:00:24,573
So what? I've been taking away
money from your pocket.

991
02:00:24,786 --> 02:00:26,413
Did you get to know about it?

992
02:00:26,888 --> 02:00:28,446
This suit was bought
with that money.

993
02:00:29,223 --> 02:00:33,182
Is it?
Hey...enough of arguments.

994
02:00:33,394 --> 02:00:36,955
Wear it now. For my sake.

995
02:00:41,102 --> 02:00:42,160
All right.

996
02:00:57,518 --> 02:01:00,681
You were so delayed! Father has
been waiting for you since long.

997
02:01:23,878 --> 02:01:26,938
Why're you looking so lost?

998
02:01:27,815 --> 02:01:30,943
Come...I'll introduce you
to some guests.

999
02:01:30,985 --> 02:01:32,179
Me?

1000
02:01:33,254 --> 02:01:35,085
You're feeling shy?

1001
02:01:36,591 --> 02:01:43,759
Do you know...in this party, the
richest of people have come?

1002
02:01:44,232 --> 02:01:47,258
Come...let me introduce
you to all of them.

1003
02:01:47,635 --> 02:01:50,069
But will you agree to something?

1004
02:01:51,038 --> 02:01:53,006
Keep quiet in theirl presence.

1005
02:01:53,474 --> 02:01:57,308
Or else the truth'll be exposed.
You understand everything.

1006
02:01:58,146 --> 02:02:00,046
Isn't it? Come on...

1007
02:02:03,151 --> 02:02:07,417
You were asking, weren't you?
He's Aarti's husband.

1008
02:02:07,989 --> 02:02:11,083
The owner of Lucknow Mills.

1009
02:02:16,964 --> 02:02:18,795
Uncle...where is Raja?
Where're you going?

1010
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:22,067
You should leave your husband
alone for some time.

1011
02:02:22,136 --> 02:02:25,037
He's mixing with people.
He's happy.

1012
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,000
All right.

1013
02:02:28,142 --> 02:02:30,372
What is your profession?

1014
02:02:33,781 --> 02:02:36,147
Isn't it such an unusual name?

1015
02:02:36,317 --> 02:02:42,552
The owner of Hindustan and
Hindustan Motor Company.

1016
02:02:45,259 --> 02:02:47,887
He has hundreds of cars.

1017
02:02:50,631 --> 02:02:51,893
What're you saying?

1018
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:55,298
You're feeling annoyed because
I'm speaking in English?

1019
02:02:55,570 --> 02:03:00,837
I'm speaking in English.
And he hates English.

1020
02:03:01,142 --> 02:03:04,771
He's of the opinion that only
those who speak English are...

1021
02:03:04,812 --> 02:03:06,541
What're you saying?

1022
02:03:06,848 --> 02:03:09,578
No...I've nothing against the
language of the English.

1023
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:11,741
In fact, I don't know
how to speak English.

1024
02:03:11,919 --> 02:03:14,854
She believes that one who doesn't
know how to speak English...

1025
02:03:15,056 --> 02:03:18,753
..he becomes degraded,
and is unfit for your society.

1026
02:03:18,926 --> 02:03:20,291
Keep quiet.

1027
02:03:20,828 --> 02:03:23,991
And you'd better know that I'm not
an owner of any motor company.

1028
02:03:24,432 --> 02:03:27,162
I'm a taxi-driver and
a tourist guide.

1029
02:03:27,535 --> 02:03:29,799
Forget about hundreds of cars,
I don't even own my own taxi.

1030
02:03:29,837 --> 02:03:31,099
I've only one vehicle, and that
too belongs to my Uncle and Aunty.

1031
02:03:31,138 --> 02:03:33,265
If you like, you may
speak to me now.

1032
02:03:33,307 --> 02:03:34,535
You see...

1033
02:03:34,609 --> 02:03:35,974
Come over here.

1034
02:03:39,113 --> 02:03:41,138
Didn't I tell you that you
should keep quiet?

1035
02:03:41,182 --> 02:03:43,173
But why're you lying to
others about me?

1036
02:03:43,384 --> 02:03:45,545
Then what should I do?
Should I tell them the truth...

1037
02:03:45,753 --> 02:03:49,189
..about your status and means?

1038
02:03:49,524 --> 02:03:52,288
Should I tell them the
reality about you?

1039
02:03:52,693 --> 02:03:57,357
That a taxi-driver has become the
son-in-law of this big family?

1040
02:03:57,732 --> 02:03:59,859
You're a shameless man.

1041
02:04:00,067 --> 02:04:01,967
You might not even be
feeling ashamed about it.

1042
02:04:02,003 --> 02:04:05,734
But hear this carefully.
We decent people are tirled...

1043
02:04:05,773 --> 02:04:08,503
..ofbeing embarrassed
because of you.

1044
02:04:09,143 --> 02:04:12,203
Now don't embarrass us any more.

1045
02:04:32,667 --> 02:04:34,601
Why're you leaving the party?

1046
02:04:34,769 --> 02:04:37,294
I'm going upstairls.
How beautiful!

1047
02:04:37,438 --> 02:04:40,635
It's such a beautiful suit.
Where did you buy it from?

1048
02:04:41,275 --> 02:04:43,266
Aarti bought it for me.

1049
02:04:45,279 --> 02:04:47,474
Why're you laughing on me?
Yes...why're you laughing?

1050
02:04:47,949 --> 02:04:52,010
Why shouldn't I laugh? This suit is
mine. I've worn it so many times.

1051
02:04:52,086 --> 02:04:53,883
It belongs to you?
Yes.

1052
02:04:53,921 --> 02:04:57,755
But I don't understand something.
Why did Aarti lie to you?

1053
02:04:58,159 --> 02:05:00,992
Aarti must be feeling
embarrassed since...

1054
02:05:01,062 --> 02:05:03,326
..Raja doesn't have
nice dress to wear.

1055
02:05:03,364 --> 02:05:06,390
She just lied a little to make
you fit for this gathering.

1056
02:05:07,101 --> 02:05:09,661
You aren't lying, are you?
Why would he lie?

1057
02:05:09,937 --> 02:05:13,532
If Aarti is embarrassed about you,
go and ask Aarti. What can we do?

1058
02:05:14,709 --> 02:05:16,870
Come on...go and ask her.

1059
02:05:36,497 --> 02:05:38,260
Like you know...

1060
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:44,133
Today is the birthday of my
husband and my darling daughter.

1061
02:05:45,172 --> 02:05:48,005
Wow! What a night it is!

1062
02:12:49,596 --> 02:12:51,029
Come on, Raja...

1063
02:12:52,299 --> 02:12:55,166
Hey! Where are you taking me?

1064
02:12:56,603 --> 02:12:59,800
You've already made quite
a scene. Come to the room now.

1065
02:13:00,074 --> 02:13:04,204
No. Not in the room. Right here!
In everybody's presence!

1066
02:13:04,945 --> 02:13:07,379
Speak whatever you like
in everybody's presence.

1067
02:13:07,681 --> 02:13:09,114
Enough ofkeeping things
under cover!

1068
02:13:09,316 --> 02:13:13,582
How could you dare to misbehave
like this with my daughter?

1069
02:13:14,421 --> 02:13:16,912
If you utter any more word...
You'd better keep quiet!

1070
02:13:17,624 --> 02:13:21,287
Who're you to interfere in a
husband and wife's matter?

1071
02:13:22,096 --> 02:13:24,724
You interfere a lot with our
lives. Keep quiet now!

1072
02:13:25,999 --> 02:13:31,562
Why're you embarrassing us
in everybody's presence? Why?

1073
02:13:32,506 --> 02:13:33,973
Embarrassment!

1074
02:13:35,209 --> 02:13:37,871
Yes...embarrassment!

1075
02:13:39,646 --> 02:13:42,638
You've said the right thing now!

1076
02:13:42,883 --> 02:13:44,373
Are you hearing?

1077
02:13:45,018 --> 02:13:50,456
All of them are embarrassed
of me. Do you know why?

1078
02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:55,390
Because an ordinary person,
a taxi-driver...

1079
02:13:56,130 --> 02:14:00,123
..has become the son-in-law of
such an affluent family.

1080
02:14:01,535 --> 02:14:07,030
And by accepting this illiterate,
naive and uncultured person...

1081
02:14:07,441 --> 02:14:11,070
..everybody's heads are
hanging in shame.

1082
02:14:11,778 --> 02:14:13,075
Poor souls!

1083
02:14:14,548 --> 02:14:17,984
They're afflicted with
a false sense of pride!

1084
02:14:24,324 --> 02:14:26,690
You too are embarrassed of me!

1085
02:14:27,027 --> 02:14:28,255
Me?
Yes.

1086
02:14:28,428 --> 02:14:30,862
Aren't you embarrassed?
No.

1087
02:14:32,499 --> 02:14:37,368
Liar! Cheat! You too
proved to be like others?

1088
02:14:39,573 --> 02:14:46,479
What've I done that you're being so
respectable towards me in public?

1089
02:14:47,014 --> 02:14:48,675
What have you not done?

1090
02:14:50,083 --> 02:14:54,486
You've lied to me. To make me fit
for this gathering...

1091
02:14:54,788 --> 02:14:57,951
..you've even made me wear
somebody's discarded dresses.

1092
02:14:59,259 --> 02:15:01,056
I did?
Didn't you?

1093
02:15:01,962 --> 02:15:03,589
Did you buy this dress?

1094
02:15:04,331 --> 02:15:06,731
I lied to you because...

1095
02:15:06,934 --> 02:15:08,731
You lied, didn't you?

1096
02:15:09,136 --> 02:15:11,070
What're you doing?

1097
02:15:11,238 --> 02:15:15,732
Actually, Aarti lied
to you because...

1098
02:15:15,776 --> 02:15:19,143
Lie! Everybody is lying!

1099
02:15:19,546 --> 02:15:23,038
Ask her! Does this dress
not belong to him?

1100
02:15:23,517 --> 02:15:25,041
Mine?
Did you not go to him...

1101
02:15:25,519 --> 02:15:27,350
..to beg him for
a dress for me?

1102
02:15:27,654 --> 02:15:30,555
My dress? What nonsense, Raja!

1103
02:15:30,724 --> 02:15:32,487
When did I tell you that
this dress is mine?

1104
02:15:34,895 --> 02:15:38,524
Why're you lying? Why're you
embarrassing Aarti in public?

1105
02:15:40,467 --> 02:15:43,959
Liars! All of you are liars!

1106
02:15:44,805 --> 02:15:47,365
I'll kill you!

1107
02:16:24,645 --> 02:16:26,112
Father!

1108
02:16:32,753 --> 02:16:35,881
You raised your hand
on my father?

1109
02:16:36,957 --> 02:16:39,084
How dare you!

1110
02:16:39,826 --> 02:16:42,556
You're really an uncultured
and a wild person.

1111
02:16:42,796 --> 02:16:44,821
You're not fit
for this place.

1112
02:16:47,267 --> 02:16:51,727
I'm realising today that by
falling in love with you...

1113
02:16:51,905 --> 02:16:58,208
..by accepting you,
I committed a big blunder.

1114
02:16:59,179 --> 02:17:01,977
I hurt all of them so much!

1115
02:17:02,949 --> 02:17:06,180
Go away from here!
Get out from here!

1116
02:17:14,361 --> 02:17:16,295
I'm not lying!

1117
02:17:18,665 --> 02:17:20,496
Leave my hand!

1118
02:17:22,169 --> 02:17:25,161
I said...leave my hand!

1119
02:18:05,779 --> 02:18:07,144
O God!

1120
02:18:08,081 --> 02:18:10,015
What did I tell him?

1121
02:18:14,421 --> 02:18:16,889
Where are you going?

1122
02:18:17,724 --> 02:18:21,091
He's going away, Mother.
Let me stop him.

1123
02:18:21,261 --> 02:18:22,489
Don't be a fool!

1124
02:18:22,896 --> 02:18:26,730
He's misbehaved with me.
He's misbehaved with you.

1125
02:18:27,067 --> 02:18:28,864
And now you'll go
to appease him?

1126
02:18:29,236 --> 02:18:31,761
Even ifhe wants to go,
how far can he go?

1127
02:18:31,905 --> 02:18:34,066
He'll roam about on the
streets all night.

1128
02:18:34,307 --> 02:18:36,571
And when he comes to his
senses in the morning...

1129
02:18:36,710 --> 02:18:39,645
..he will come back
rushing to you.

1130
02:18:39,813 --> 02:18:41,440
He won't come.

1131
02:18:41,615 --> 02:18:45,551
Listen carefully to what
your mother has to say.

1132
02:18:46,319 --> 02:18:53,987
Ifhe truly loves you,
he will surely come.

1133
02:18:54,895 --> 02:18:57,830
He won't come.
He will come.

1134
02:18:58,665 --> 02:19:01,133
He won't come.
He will come.

1135
02:19:01,902 --> 02:19:05,394
He won't come.

1136
02:19:44,211 --> 02:19:47,112
What's happened?

1137
02:19:50,917 --> 02:19:53,943
What? I'm pregnant?

1138
02:19:54,254 --> 02:19:57,087
Yes. You're three months pregnant.

1139
02:19:59,292 --> 02:20:04,025
I will have to go to
Palankhet right away.

1140
02:20:04,331 --> 02:20:07,732
I'll have to tell Raja
about it right away.

1141
02:20:07,934 --> 02:20:11,495
No. You cannot travel under
any cirlcumstances.

1142
02:20:11,738 --> 02:20:13,433
Your condition is very delicate.

1143
02:20:13,473 --> 02:20:16,704
If there's any tension on
your heart or your mind...

1144
02:20:16,810 --> 02:20:18,471
..there's a risk of miscarriage.

1145
02:20:18,578 --> 02:20:21,911
You'll have to be very careful
for at least six months.

1146
02:20:21,948 --> 02:20:25,145
Please ensure that she doesn't
travel for at least six months.

1147
02:20:25,185 --> 02:20:25,549
All right.

1148
02:20:25,986 --> 02:20:30,719
But you don't realise how important
it is for me to go.

1149
02:20:30,757 --> 02:20:33,351
If I don't go...
I will go.

1150
02:20:34,528 --> 02:20:35,893
I will go.

1151
02:20:38,031 --> 02:20:41,762
When will this mother of
yours be of some use?

1152
02:20:42,435 --> 02:20:44,300
I'll bring back Raja.

1153
02:20:44,804 --> 02:20:45,532
Ifhe's annoyed with you...

1154
02:20:45,572 --> 02:20:51,238
..I'll convince him in your name
and bring him back.

1155
02:20:51,278 --> 02:20:54,304
But he...
Why do you worry?

1156
02:20:54,347 --> 02:20:58,249
I'm there. Leave everything
to your mother.

1157
02:20:59,085 --> 02:21:01,485
Mother...
Everything...

1158
02:21:03,557 --> 02:21:04,922
Of course...

1159
02:21:06,026 --> 02:21:08,790
Whatever has happened
has happened.

1160
02:21:08,962 --> 02:21:11,021
But you too made a big mistake.

1161
02:21:11,197 --> 02:21:13,995
You shouldn't have left her
behind and come back.

1162
02:21:14,067 --> 02:21:17,002
No matter how much a husband
and wife quarrel...

1163
02:21:17,137 --> 02:21:19,867
..you shouldn't have
left her there.

1164
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:22,900
Uncle...a big scene had
been created there.

1165
02:21:23,076 --> 02:21:24,839
The condition had crossed
much farther.

1166
02:21:25,045 --> 02:21:27,036
And I too had drunk- liquor
for the first time.

1167
02:21:27,981 --> 02:21:30,211
I wonder what all I did
under the influence of liquor.

1168
02:21:30,350 --> 02:21:35,413
And they too had instigated
me a lot. And Aarti...

1169
02:21:35,488 --> 02:21:40,619
No! Don't suspect Aarti.
After all, she's your wife.

1170
02:21:40,894 --> 02:21:45,058
All husbands and wives quarrel.
It doesn't mean that...

1171
02:21:45,332 --> 02:21:48,495
Come on...go and appease her.
And bring her back.

1172
02:21:49,502 --> 02:21:52,027
She's very annoyed at me.
She won't return.

1173
02:21:52,238 --> 02:21:56,231
Fool! Is a wife's annoyance
to be taken seriously?

1174
02:21:56,376 --> 02:22:02,144
She must be waiting for you.
Go and bring her back.

1175
02:22:02,182 --> 02:22:04,275
She won't return, Aunty...

1176
02:22:10,323 --> 02:22:14,623
Look! You were just thinking about
it. And she has even returned.

1177
02:22:15,729 --> 02:22:17,128
Look! Baby has come!

1178
02:22:25,939 --> 02:22:28,407
Where's Aarti?
Aarti didn't come?

1179
02:22:28,842 --> 02:22:30,810
No. Neither will she come.

1180
02:22:35,615 --> 02:22:37,879
What is it?
You may read it.

1181
02:22:49,095 --> 02:22:51,063
This...
What is it?

1182
02:22:54,968 --> 02:22:56,936
Divorce?!

1183
02:23:02,008 --> 02:23:03,373
But why?

1184
02:23:04,377 --> 02:23:06,811
Everything has been mentioned
in these divorce papers.

1185
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:08,479
No.

1186
02:23:08,915 --> 02:23:13,318
Our Aarti cannot do this.

1187
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:17,050
I'll go to her. All of us
will go to her.

1188
02:23:17,090 --> 02:23:19,490
We'll explain to her.
No.

1189
02:23:20,694 --> 02:23:25,256
Nobody will go to her to
beg or plead for my sake.

1190
02:23:26,166 --> 02:23:30,899
What does she think ofherself?.
Does she want divorce from me?

1191
02:23:32,072 --> 02:23:34,131
Will she be able to
live without me?

1192
02:23:34,808 --> 02:23:36,571
All right then! I too
will live without her.

1193
02:23:36,743 --> 02:23:39,371
What're you saying?
No, Aunty.

1194
02:23:39,913 --> 02:23:43,144
If anybody of you goes to her
you won't see me alive.

1195
02:23:43,783 --> 02:23:47,310
We haven't come here to see
your new performance.

1196
02:23:48,254 --> 02:23:53,954
If you hate Aarti so much,
then sign the divorce papers.

1197
02:24:14,247 --> 02:24:16,477
Tell that daughter of
an affluent father...

1198
02:24:17,183 --> 02:24:19,777
..that marriage might be
a game in her society...

1199
02:24:20,053 --> 02:24:24,080
..which can be terminated by
signing a piece of paper.

1200
02:24:24,657 --> 02:24:29,287
But in our society, we treat
marriage as worship.

1201
02:24:29,996 --> 02:24:32,965
After encirlcling fire for
seven times...

1202
02:24:33,166 --> 02:24:35,361
..the relationship
becomes permanent...

1203
02:24:37,103 --> 02:24:43,008
..even if we don't see each
other's face for a lifetime.

1204
02:25:10,804 --> 02:25:12,101
Uncle!

1205
02:25:22,582 --> 02:25:24,209
Mother!

1206
02:25:34,394 --> 02:25:35,918
Father!

1207
02:25:39,299 --> 02:25:41,392
He wants you to divorce.

1208
02:25:43,036 --> 02:25:44,264
Divorce?

1209
02:25:44,671 --> 02:25:48,505
Yes. The documents in your
hands are meant for divorce.

1210
02:25:48,875 --> 02:25:50,775
He has signed the documents too.

1211
02:25:51,144 --> 02:25:53,237
He wants divorce from you.

1212
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:55,211
No.

1213
02:25:55,882 --> 02:25:58,043
Raja cannot do it.

1214
02:25:58,985 --> 02:26:04,150
He cannot punish me so severely
for such a small matter.

1215
02:26:04,490 --> 02:26:08,119
Mother...you had said that
you'll convince him.

1216
02:26:08,394 --> 02:26:10,726
Didn't you say?
What could I do, my daughter?

1217
02:26:11,898 --> 02:26:16,767
I tried a lot.
I even pleaded with him.

1218
02:26:17,704 --> 02:26:22,004
I told him not to ruin
my daughter's life.

1219
02:26:22,575 --> 02:26:24,839
But what could we do?

1220
02:26:25,178 --> 02:26:28,511
He has begun to hate you severely.

1221
02:26:29,082 --> 02:26:32,916
You told him that I'm pregnant?
Yes, we did.

1222
02:26:33,419 --> 02:26:35,046
We told him a hundred times.

1223
02:26:35,321 --> 02:26:37,755
But he made such an abominable
statement that...

1224
02:26:37,790 --> 02:26:38,757
..we're feeling embarrassed
even to mention it.

1225
02:26:38,791 --> 02:26:40,656
What did he say?

1226
02:26:41,394 --> 02:26:43,021
What did he say?

1227
02:26:43,096 --> 02:26:46,031
He said that the child
should be aborted.

1228
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:11,916
He cannot do this. He
cannot do this with you.

1229
02:27:12,358 --> 02:27:14,485
He can do anything.

1230
02:27:15,695 --> 02:27:20,325
Out of anger...out of stubbornness,
he can do anything.

1231
02:27:20,633 --> 02:27:22,396
No!

1232
02:27:22,936 --> 02:27:24,494
He can do nothing.

1233
02:27:24,938 --> 02:27:26,929
As long as I'm there,
he can do nothing.

1234
02:27:29,676 --> 02:27:31,871
Congratulations, Father.

1235
02:27:32,745 --> 02:27:34,178
What?

1236
02:27:34,914 --> 02:27:38,281
You forgot your curse, Father?
Curse?

1237
02:27:42,622 --> 02:27:44,556
Do you remember...

1238
02:27:45,458 --> 02:27:47,892
I'd asked you for your blessings...

1239
02:27:48,428 --> 02:27:52,091
..and you had said that my
marriage will never be successful.

1240
02:27:52,532 --> 02:27:56,161
That I would never be happy
by staying away from you.

1241
02:27:56,769 --> 02:28:00,102
Your statement proved to be true.
No, that was just...

1242
02:28:00,139 --> 02:28:05,702
No progeny can protect itself
from theirl parents' curse.

1243
02:28:07,513 --> 02:28:10,641
But remember what I've to say.

1244
02:28:12,085 --> 02:28:15,213
I won't divorce him.

1245
02:28:17,090 --> 02:28:20,548
He wants to leave me, doesn't he?

1246
02:28:20,793 --> 02:28:23,626
But I'll never leave him.

1247
02:28:24,564 --> 02:28:27,431
I'll give birth to his son.

1248
02:28:28,601 --> 02:28:34,437
It's just that I've lost
faith in this world.

1249
02:28:34,907 --> 02:28:37,671
I've lost faith in love.

1250
02:33:11,317 --> 02:33:15,151
I'm still young.

1251
02:33:15,955 --> 02:33:19,118
I'm still young.

1252
02:33:22,595 --> 02:33:23,687
Who's she?

1253
02:33:23,829 --> 02:33:25,490
She's Shalu.
Is she fast?

1254
02:33:26,299 --> 02:33:29,496
She's Shalu Madam,
Aarti's step-mother.

1255
02:33:29,869 --> 02:33:32,497
Mother? Is a mother
supposed to be like this?

1256
02:33:34,507 --> 02:33:36,372
Madam! Greetings!

1257
02:33:39,178 --> 02:33:40,543
Greetings, Madam.

1258
02:33:41,113 --> 02:33:43,581
What're you doing here?
I've come to visit Mumbai.

1259
02:33:44,083 --> 02:33:45,710
He's Balwant Singh, my husband.

1260
02:33:45,751 --> 02:33:47,651
Greet her!

1261
02:33:47,953 --> 02:33:49,420
Greetings!

1262
02:33:51,123 --> 02:33:52,750
Get up...what're you doing?

1263
02:33:53,592 --> 02:33:57,653
I was looking as to how big
people appear from the bottom.

1264
02:33:58,297 --> 02:34:00,162
A typical villager!

1265
02:34:01,701 --> 02:34:03,362
A villager!?
Scoundrel!

1266
02:34:03,402 --> 02:34:05,962
What were you doing?
Come on now...

1267
02:34:06,138 --> 02:34:10,040
Won't you allow me an opportunity?

1268
02:34:10,276 --> 02:34:14,440
I'll make her move...
Stop!

1269
02:34:15,381 --> 02:34:16,712
Madam!
What is it?

1270
02:34:17,116 --> 02:34:18,378
You're so nice!

1271
02:34:18,784 --> 02:34:21,582
Ask him to stop this!
Stop it...

1272
02:34:22,088 --> 02:34:24,648
Madam is very nice.
Let me serve...

1273
02:34:25,691 --> 02:34:27,283
Why've you come here?

1274
02:34:27,893 --> 02:34:32,387
Madam...we've come to meet Aarti.

1275
02:34:33,299 --> 02:34:35,995
I wonder what happened between
Raja and Aarti that...

1276
02:34:36,035 --> 02:34:39,471
What have you got to do with it?
She doesn't want to meet you.

1277
02:34:39,638 --> 02:34:41,902
She hates you people.

1278
02:34:42,174 --> 02:34:44,005
She wants to forget all of you.

1279
02:34:44,210 --> 02:34:46,644
I don't believe you.

1280
02:34:48,614 --> 02:34:51,583
And don't dare to
return. Understand?

1281
02:34:51,784 --> 02:34:55,220
Stop it now! Goodbye!

1282
02:34:55,254 --> 02:34:56,983
Come on!
No!

1283
02:34:57,423 --> 02:35:00,324
Listen to me...
Come...let's go.

1284
02:35:00,593 --> 02:35:02,686
Stop!
What is it?

1285
02:35:03,162 --> 02:35:04,754
Look...there!

1286
02:35:09,135 --> 02:35:11,899
What is this that I see?

1287
02:35:13,539 --> 02:35:15,131
A child!

1288
02:35:18,377 --> 02:35:22,541
Yes. We saw a child in Aarti's
arms with our own eyes.

1289
02:35:22,748 --> 02:35:25,239
Your child is very cute.

1290
02:35:25,518 --> 02:35:27,418
Why did Aarti hide such an
important thing from us?

1291
02:35:27,586 --> 02:35:29,247
It's your child, and we
don't even know about it.

1292
02:35:29,488 --> 02:35:32,924
It's your child! Your own blood!
We saw it with our own eyes.

1293
02:35:35,428 --> 02:35:36,952
My child!

1294
02:35:38,531 --> 02:35:39,793
My child!

1295
02:35:55,314 --> 02:36:00,980
Lord! Today is Karwa-Chauth.
And like every married woman...

1296
02:36:01,153 --> 02:36:06,386
I pray that wherever my husband
is, however he might be...

1297
02:36:06,692 --> 02:36:09,627
May he be blessed
with my own life.

1298
02:37:45,558 --> 02:37:47,651
Father!

1299
02:37:50,262 --> 02:37:53,231
What happened?
Raja had come.

1300
02:37:53,599 --> 02:37:55,396
He took away the child.
What?

1301
02:37:57,436 --> 02:38:01,167
Did you see? Didn't I say that
he can do anything?

1302
02:38:01,507 --> 02:38:03,304
He took away the child,
didn't he?

1303
02:38:03,576 --> 02:38:05,703
Brother-in-law...please take
care of Aarti.

1304
02:38:05,744 --> 02:38:07,609
I'll go and telephone the
police right away. Come on...

1305
02:38:10,482 --> 02:38:13,178
What're you doing?
I'm telephoning the police.

1306
02:38:15,354 --> 02:38:17,845
You're a donkey's son.
You cannot be my son.

1307
02:38:17,890 --> 02:38:19,482
But didn't you say that...?

1308
02:38:20,693 --> 02:38:24,185
We don't have to act
like we say.

1309
02:38:24,463 --> 02:38:26,863
We can't get a better opportunity.
What?

1310
02:38:27,199 --> 02:38:30,134
We'll chop off the necks
of Raja and his child.

1311
02:38:30,936 --> 02:38:33,928
Listen...nobody will suspect it.

1312
02:38:34,607 --> 02:38:38,099
Aarti will become free too.
Then we'll get you married to her.

1313
02:38:38,477 --> 02:38:42,243
Thus brother-in-law's entirle
property will be in my hands.

1314
02:38:42,548 --> 02:38:45,346
And don't mention about
this to your Aunt!

1315
02:38:45,384 --> 02:38:46,817
All right. But why?

1316
02:38:47,086 --> 02:38:49,748
She's a fool! I know that
she might cause my downfall.

1317
02:38:50,022 --> 02:38:52,786
But we will ease her
out gradually.

1318
02:38:57,563 --> 02:39:01,659
Now we have to find out where
Raja has gone with the child.

1319
02:39:03,435 --> 02:39:07,872
The police wants to know as to
where Raja can go with the child.

1320
02:39:08,273 --> 02:39:10,070
Palankhet!

1321
02:39:10,209 --> 02:39:12,973
Look at the flower's condition...
you don't even scold the gardener!

1322
02:39:13,012 --> 02:39:14,479
Shall I become a gardener?

1323
02:39:33,198 --> 02:39:35,530
What happened, my child?

1324
02:39:41,373 --> 02:39:43,102
My child!

1325
02:39:45,711 --> 02:39:48,373
My child!

1326
02:39:50,549 --> 02:39:53,848
No...whatever has happened
hasn't happened for good.

1327
02:39:53,886 --> 02:39:56,286
No matter how serious the
quarrel might've been...

1328
02:39:56,455 --> 02:39:58,753
..you shouldn't have
severed the relationship.

1329
02:39:58,857 --> 02:40:03,624
What had been so serious that
you sent divorce papers to Raja?

1330
02:40:04,730 --> 02:40:10,794
What? I sent the divorce papers?
I wanted to sever the relationship?

1331
02:40:11,537 --> 02:40:14,028
I was carrying the child.

1332
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:19,737
I couldn't even travel. And Raja
wanted me to abort my child?

1333
02:40:20,112 --> 02:40:22,273
Does he hate me so much?

1334
02:40:22,314 --> 02:40:26,683
What're you saying? You're levelling
such a serious accusation on him?

1335
02:40:26,852 --> 02:40:29,912
I admit that he is old-fashioned
in his thinking.

1336
02:40:30,189 --> 02:40:34,751
But even today, he's
madly in love with you.

1337
02:40:35,394 --> 02:40:36,452
Yes...

1338
02:40:37,663 --> 02:40:43,624
Your mother and your uncle had come
here with your signed divorce papers.

1339
02:40:43,736 --> 02:40:46,705
Ask your mother. Ask her.

1340
02:40:46,839 --> 02:40:48,830
Hadn't they come to
sever the relation?

1341
02:40:57,483 --> 02:40:59,951
I haven't done anything.

1342
02:41:02,888 --> 02:41:04,913
Tell me the truth.
No!

1343
02:41:05,257 --> 02:41:07,623
Tell me the truth,
or I'll thrash you!

1344
02:41:07,693 --> 02:41:08,682
No...no!
Tell me!

1345
02:41:09,094 --> 02:41:10,721
I'll tell you!

1346
02:41:12,097 --> 02:41:14,691
The divorce papers did not
bear Raja's signature.

1347
02:41:14,967 --> 02:41:17,026
It had been signed
by my brother.

1348
02:41:19,505 --> 02:41:21,939
Raja didn't want to break
his ties with Aarti.

1349
02:41:22,641 --> 02:41:25,405
We wanted to destroy
her relationship.

1350
02:41:27,045 --> 02:41:29,946
Why?
To keep control...

1351
02:41:30,582 --> 02:41:32,675
..over your property
and your daughter.

1352
02:41:32,918 --> 02:41:36,285
You destroyed my daughter's
marriage for property?

1353
02:41:36,789 --> 02:41:39,849
I won't spare you alive!

1354
02:41:40,392 --> 02:41:42,553
No, Father.

1355
02:41:42,995 --> 02:41:49,195
You want to protect her? The
one who destroyed your home?

1356
02:41:49,768 --> 02:41:54,137
No, Father...I destroyed my
own home. Nobody is at fault.

1357
02:41:56,408 --> 02:41:59,502
But, mother...let me tell
you something.

1358
02:42:00,679 --> 02:42:02,772
I didn't have my mother.

1359
02:42:03,048 --> 02:42:06,040
I believed blindly
everything you said...

1360
02:42:06,451 --> 02:42:08,942
..because you related
to me as a mother.

1361
02:42:09,388 --> 02:42:13,290
A mother's status is the
most significant one.

1362
02:42:13,659 --> 02:42:18,392
Never fool around with your progeny
in your

1363
02:42:19,198 --> 02:42:23,658
Otherwise nobody will trust
one's mother henceforth.

1364
02:42:25,137 --> 02:42:28,971
Please forgive me.

1365
02:42:31,109 --> 02:42:32,770
All is not lost yet.

1366
02:42:33,212 --> 02:42:37,171
Tomorrow morning, Raja will come
straight home with the child.

1367
02:42:37,549 --> 02:42:40,313
We'll reunite you with him there.

1368
02:42:40,652 --> 02:42:42,085
Won't we?
Yes.

1369
02:42:53,065 --> 02:42:56,796
Raja has come.

1370
02:42:57,336 --> 02:43:01,432
Raja has come. He has
the child with him.

1371
02:43:01,673 --> 02:43:03,698
But you won't come out
and appear before him.

1372
02:43:04,042 --> 02:43:07,034
Firlst we will meet him, explain
to him. Then you may come.

1373
02:43:07,279 --> 02:43:09,144
Please don't let her come out.

1374
02:43:21,360 --> 02:43:22,759
Aunty!

1375
02:43:26,164 --> 02:43:27,927
My child!

1376
02:43:29,034 --> 02:43:31,764
It's my child!

1377
02:43:41,313 --> 02:43:42,678
No!

1378
02:43:43,448 --> 02:43:44,608
Stop!

1379
02:43:47,052 --> 02:43:48,314
No!

1380
02:46:19,771 --> 02:46:22,001
Come on...kill him!

1381
02:46:32,751 --> 02:46:34,241
No!

1382
02:46:39,858 --> 02:46:44,625
I am on your side.
Beat these scoundrels!

1383
02:46:45,063 --> 02:46:47,623
I am with you.
Hit these rascals!

1384
02:47:16,161 --> 02:47:19,130
Rascal! You destroyed my
daughter's home!

1385
02:48:01,273 --> 02:48:02,001
No, Uncle!

1386
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:03,132
No!

1387
02:48:05,977 --> 02:48:10,004
Stop!

1388
02:48:12,717 --> 02:48:14,344
No!

1389
02:48:15,420 --> 02:48:17,115
Leave my son!

1390
02:48:18,356 --> 02:48:21,848
No, Brother-in-law!
You've threatened me enough!

1391
02:48:22,160 --> 02:48:25,254
You've threatened us enough.
And I kept on tolerating it.

1392
02:48:25,931 --> 02:48:28,263
We lived on your money,
and at the same time...

1393
02:48:28,300 --> 02:48:30,700
..we continued to ruin
your daughter's home.

1394
02:48:31,036 --> 02:48:34,870
Yes! We've ruined your
daughter's home.

1395
02:48:35,740 --> 02:48:39,073
We've poisoned her life. Else,
you would've transferred your...

1396
02:48:39,411 --> 02:48:43,677
..entirle property in favour of
this illiterate son-in-law.

1397
02:48:44,115 --> 02:48:46,640
And what would we've got?

1398
02:48:48,820 --> 02:48:52,950
Now that you know our truth,
and you know everything now...

1399
02:48:53,558 --> 02:48:59,622
We're now taking your progeny to
bury him in some deserted land!

1400
02:48:59,798 --> 02:49:01,425
No!
You don't want to do it, do you?

1401
02:49:01,633 --> 02:49:06,866
Then transfer all your
property in my favour!

1402
02:49:07,172 --> 02:49:09,402
Come on, my son!

1403
02:49:15,113 --> 02:49:16,637
Come on!

1404
02:49:55,687 --> 02:49:59,088
You'll bury my child!?

1405
02:50:09,367 --> 02:50:11,927
Leave him!

1406
02:50:13,772 --> 02:50:16,605
Please rescue my father!

1407
02:50:17,709 --> 02:50:20,701
You'll bury my child!?

1408
02:50:21,646 --> 02:50:24,012
Stop it...or he will die!

1409
02:50:28,920 --> 02:50:31,150
Stop him, Aarti!

1410
02:51:03,988 --> 02:51:06,081
Listen to what I've to say.

1411
02:51:11,229 --> 02:51:13,823
Listen to what
Aarti has to say.

1412
02:51:13,898 --> 02:51:17,425
At least listen to her.
No...no!

1413
02:51:18,403 --> 02:51:20,234
Nobody will say anything today.

1414
02:51:20,638 --> 02:51:23,129
Today...only Raja will say
and Aarti will listen...

1415
02:51:23,575 --> 02:51:26,271
Aarti will say and
Raja will listen...

1416
02:51:27,312 --> 02:51:31,942
It's our fault that we
didn't trust each other...

1417
02:51:32,183 --> 02:51:34,549
..and listened to what
the world had to say.

1418
02:51:34,819 --> 02:51:36,446
Our relationship was at fault.

1419
02:51:36,688 --> 02:51:40,590
It was so fragile that
it broke so easily?

1420
02:51:41,926 --> 02:51:48,024
How could I believe that you don't
love me...that you hate me?

1421
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:55,303
And how could you believe that
I could be unfaithful to you?

1422
02:51:56,307 --> 02:52:00,607
That I could hide from you
that we have our child?

1423
02:52:02,447 --> 02:52:05,814
Believe me...I didn't do
any such thing...

1424
02:52:10,688 --> 02:52:13,589
So you still don't believe me?

1425
02:52:14,859 --> 02:52:19,193
All right. What do you want?

1426
02:52:19,731 --> 02:52:22,291
That I should walk away
from your life?

1427
02:52:22,567 --> 02:52:23,966
I'll go away.

1428
02:52:24,702 --> 02:52:26,693
You want the child, don't you?

1429
02:52:27,272 --> 02:52:30,537
You may keep the child
with you forever.

1430
02:52:31,009 --> 02:52:33,341
I'll manage to live
without the child.

1431
02:52:33,878 --> 02:52:38,713
But I cannot bear your suspicion
and your hatred for me.

1432
02:52:39,717 --> 02:52:46,623
Just remember...I've
always loved you.

1433
02:52:47,325 --> 02:52:50,852
And I'll always
continue to love you.

1434
02:52:54,833 --> 02:52:56,562
Stop her, Raja!

1435
02:52:56,835 --> 02:52:59,668
Don't go...please stop!

1436
02:53:00,004 --> 02:53:01,972
Come on, Father...

1437
02:53:04,008 --> 02:53:05,441
Let's go...

1438
02:53:11,015 --> 02:53:13,745
Do something...
please do something!

1439
02:53:28,933 --> 02:53:34,803
''Do not leave us''

1440
02:53:35,940 --> 02:53:41,310
''Do not go away...do not leave us''

1441
02:54:20,251 --> 02:54:26,349
''Keep your word, my friend''

1442
02:54:27,191 --> 02:54:32,925
''Remember us, always...Forget us not''

1443
02:54:42,574 --> 02:54:50,174
''Do not leave me...''

1444
02:54:53,184 --> 02:55:02,058
''Do not leave me''

1445
02:56:01,019 --> 02:56:08,824
''Know what's wrong with me?
What intoxication I feel?''

1446
02:56:21,305 --> 02:56:27,869
''This is my punishment for
falling in love with you''

1447
02:56:29,180 --> 02:56:35,642
''This is what I get for
falling in love with you''

1448
02:56:45,029 --> 02:56:58,966
''This is what I get for
falling in love with you''
