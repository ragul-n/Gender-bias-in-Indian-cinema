00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:25,852
'The world drifted away
into many continents'

3
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:29,274
'The continents were
divided into countries'

4
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,064
'Countries were split into many states'

5
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:37,172
'In 2014, Telangana detached itself
from Andhra Pradesh...'

6
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,912
'...as an independent state'

7
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:41,257
'Since Hyderabad was
part of Telangana...'

8
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:43,222
'...it was decided to announce'

9
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,221
'...Visakhapatnam as capital
of Andhra Pradesh'

10
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:48,729
'But since law and order was disrupted...'

11
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:52,310
'...and since commissioner Ramakrishnan
who came to rectify it was murdered'

12
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,859
'...Amaravathi became
the de facto seat of governance'

13
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:58,185
'Till date because the motive behind
that murder has not been ascertained'

14
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:00,744
'...all hell broke loose
in Andhra Pradesh'

15
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:01,593
Silence!

16
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:05,156
Now the Home Minister
can record his statement

17
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,894
Hon'ble Chief minister and I
have taken a joint decision

18
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:11,244
If this Assembly agrees...

19
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,561
...within 2 months, we can nab
the culprit who killed the commissioner

20
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:16,352
And the motive behind it

21
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:18,102
I can assure you

22
00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:20,734
First disclose your decision

23
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:24,227
We have spoken to Mr Ramanathan
Home minister of Tamil Nadu

24
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,933
He has agreed to send an efficient
police officer to our State

25
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:30,477
Don't we have efficient
police officers in our State?

26
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:31,925
Of course we do

27
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,978
But they haven't divulged
anything for a year

28
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:34,968
So what?

29
00:02:34,993 --> 00:02:38,202
Like our Vizag, in the port cities
of Chennai and Tuticorin...

30
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:40,310
...with many badges
pinned to his credit

31
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:44,477
...he went up to South Africa and
arrested an international criminal

32
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:48,769
We are bringing in here
the most powerful police officer

33
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:49,858
Who is he?

34
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,286
Duraisingam

35
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:00,335
"The solitary lion"

36
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,542
"Here comes the lion
The 1 man battalion"

37
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:10,827
'You might have seen a lion
in a photo, movie or TV'

38
00:03:10,852 --> 00:03:13,352
'You may have even seen
a lion locked up in a cage'

39
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:16,003
'Have you seen it stride
in the forest with pride?'

40
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:18,744
'Have you seen it hunt its prey
with a barbaric vengeance?'

41
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:20,978
'It weighs 1 Â½ tons
when it strikes you'

42
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,102
'Do you want to see its power?'

43
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:24,644
'Witness it right now'

44
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:33,646
"The hunter-lion"

45
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,826
'From one city to another,
country or continent...

46
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,811
'...I will pursue my target
with a fixed aim relentlessly'

47
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,599
I'll make sure
you get death penalty

48
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:07,644
But our law doesn't permit bringing in
a police officer from another State

49
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:10,179
So we plan to transfer this case
to Central Bureau of Investigation

50
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:13,140
And bring him to
our State through CBI

51
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:15,054
He will investigate
the commissioner's murder

52
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:18,531
And also allot the responsibility
of restoring law and order in Vizag

53
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:30,344
I got Duraisingam's number

54
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:31,411
Give it to me

55
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:35,946
Isn't this Duraisingam?

56
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:40,788
Don't come to Andhra

57
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:44,394
If you step into
Vizag police station...

58
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,394
...I'll chop your legs!

59
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:54,262
What did he say?

60
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,890
'I was in a tearing hurry
I didn't get a haircut'

61
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,607
'Come and do the needful' he said

62
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,403
Not just his legs
Chop his neck too!

63
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:32,546
"Come and get 'em
Beat them numb"

64
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:34,890
"Come and detect
Come to protect"

65
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:37,269
"Assail and assault
Have a bloody blast"

66
00:05:37,562 --> 00:05:41,185
"The lion stalks its prey
Duraisingam is on his way"

67
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,477
"Prowls night and day"

68
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:49,242
"Lion with momentum
He is Duraisingam"

69
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:51,257
"Roars fearsome"

70
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:53,240
"Strike to seal his fate"

71
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,769
"Show them your power innate"

72
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:07,414
Chop that Madrasi's legs

73
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,938
"Enraged 1-man army
Eliminates his enemy"

74
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:13,254
"Patrols to the T, his territory"

75
00:06:15,297 --> 00:06:19,088
"The lion, king of the jungle
Duraisingam on a mission possible"

76
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:24,195
I am not a Madrasi!

77
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:25,870
Indian!!

78
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,531
Who called me?

79
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,364
Who segregated Tamil Nadu police
from Andhra police?

80
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:35,621
Tamil Nadu, Andhra,
Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala

81
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:37,938
...have been divided
as States for convenience

82
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:40,304
Not as different nations

83
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:42,198
I am an Indian police!

84
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:49,151
Sir, autograph please

85
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,477
Look here, the deputy commissioner
who is arriving today...

86
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,143
...has stripped many rowdies
of their trousers in Tamil Nadu

87
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,271
If any of you mess up anything-

88
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:09,936
Will he remove their caps, sir?

89
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:11,519
Or their belts, sir?

90
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,490
Who are you?
Don't block the way

91
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:24,519
I would like your autograph, sir

92
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,732
You are-

93
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:29,596
I asked you for your autograph
at the railway station but you left-

94
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:32,329
I thought it was just for fun
You're serious about it

95
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:33,711
What will you do
with my autograph?

96
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:38,398
No police officer has the guts to
trample 10 rowdies in a public place

97
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,995
Durai-singam

98
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,149
- Girls shouldn't come to police stations
- What about your house then, sir?

99
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:50,615
I don't like anyone
speaking out of turn

100
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:54,269
Ask him if it's alright to
stand in a corner and talk

101
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:57,147
I was told you are a strict officer

102
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:59,473
But I heard you hit 12 men
and sent them to a hospital

103
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,054
I never knew you had
such stamina!

104
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:03,508
Did you find out about them
 and why they attacked me?

105
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:05,101
I enquired after thrashing them, sir

106
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:06,953
But their excuse is very cheap, sir

107
00:09:07,104 --> 00:09:09,265
- What?
- You were wearing a blue shirt it seems

108
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,625
They didn't like it one bit

109
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,108
That's why they hit yo-

110
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:14,109
They took an aversion
to my blue shirt?!

111
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:15,171
Release them immediately

112
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:16,367
We've filed a report, sir

113
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:17,781
Yov! Just tear that report, man

114
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:20,211
- 'Tear it, huh? '
- You said he has was strict

115
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:22,164
He is walking away
with such loose talk

116
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:25,547
This file has all the details
of the commissioner's murder case

117
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:28,021
Am I here to investigate
the commissioner's murder?

118
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:31,641
I thought I can enjoy 'Avakkai biriyani'
and relax for a couple of months

119
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:33,831
Overloading me
with work on my 1st day

120
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:40,394
He has been appointed
by CBI to assist you

121
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:42,765
Let this remain confidential for a while

122
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:45,132
That file shouldn't
budge an inch from there

123
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,700
But I want all the details
from it on to my laptop

124
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,717
I want details of all officers here
Their character, service records in 2 days

125
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:56,132
When I was on the train
this morning some chap called me

126
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:58,382
From True Caller I found out
he is Beemli Selva

127
00:09:58,602 --> 00:10:00,185
Sir, he is part of Reddy's gang

128
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:21,244
'Madhusudhana Reddy'

129
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:26,852
'A businessman who has Vizag city and port
 under his control through fear and force'

130
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:28,387
'VIP and don'

131
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:31,769
'Supporter of Ramprasad,
minister of central civil aviation'

132
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:36,725
'Without Reddy's consent, a container
can neither enter nor exit Vizag port

133
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,602
'Reddy embraces those
who endorse his actions'

134
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:41,936
'Destroys those who defy him'

135
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:43,460
'This is Reddy's character'

136
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,868
Are you brainless or what?

137
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:49,670
You've assaulted a policeman

138
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,441
He has come to investigate
the commissioner's murder case

139
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:54,242
You've needled him unnecessarily

140
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:57,498
What will you do if he arrests you
for the commissioner's murder?

141
00:10:58,477 --> 00:11:01,644
If you wrestle with a police officer
you should come out the winner

142
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:03,394
Clear out!

143
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:06,921
Call Vittal sir now

144
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,885
Yes, Reddy

145
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:52,324
'His father Ram Prasad is
the minister for Central Aviation'

146
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:54,349
'His mother Rebecca
 is a British woman'

147
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:56,643
Steve and his wife
are waiting in the office, sir

148
00:11:58,162 --> 00:12:04,462
'He imports all iron scraps in Australia
to his 4 steel plants in India'

149
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:06,955
'...for export and import
the Australian Govt has conferred

150
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:09,326
...the honorary post
 of High commissioner'

151
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:32,361
Director of CBI is a close
friend of mine, I'll take care

152
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,107
Where is constable Veera?

153
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:45,756
Gone to nab Thangam
the 'Loan shark'

154
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,445
She is a rowdy female, I say

155
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,437
Akka, you're in a league of your own!

156
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:52,404
He has gone in disguise, sir

157
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:58,012
"Thangam, my precious dear
I came looking for you here"

158
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:01,759
(song from 'Naanum Rowdy Dhaan')

159
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:07,174
"My diamond sparkler new
One day I shall âtakeâ you"

160
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,850
Sis, he's flirting with you

161
00:14:14,344 --> 00:14:16,677
"Her faceâ¦oh my God!"

162
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:18,978
"Her shapeâ¦wow, good Lord!!"

163
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:21,133
"In toto
Aiyaiyaiyo!"

164
00:14:21,204 --> 00:14:23,256
"You mesmerize me on the whole
Body, mind, heart and soul"

165
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:24,435
Why did you drag me here?

166
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,915
My sister who was averse to marriage
has fallen flat for you, da

167
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:29,690
Love, oh God!

168
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:34,121
"Who is he, I wonder?
Why is he here, I ponder?"

169
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:38,675
"He smiles at me, he appreciates
I am the center of his universeâ

170
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:43,808
"What is this heavenly feeling?
I don't know, I'm still reeling"

171
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,286
Just because I sang this song
did you think 'I am also a rowdy'?

172
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:51,232
I am a police officer

173
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,257
I have come to arrest you

174
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:58,438
You can be a cop
or a foolish chap

175
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:00,131
I am in love with you

176
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:01,323
Lord Rama, help me!

177
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:03,554
First marry me

178
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:04,890
Then arrest me

179
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:06,189
After that attack me

180
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:08,228
Aiyo! I am just a youngster

181
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:09,790
But you look like
a smooth operator!

182
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:11,750
I am as thin as a beanpole

183
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:13,608
But you sing like a nightingale

184
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,081
My sister is a chaste maiden!

185
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:16,856
Get lost, you son of a gu-

186
00:15:16,944 --> 00:15:17,773
Swine!

187
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:22,474
Only because you're a beanpole and
a nightingale, my sister flipped for you

188
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,828
If your sister liked my song...

189
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:28,760
...the original singer is Anirudh, man

190
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:31,829
He is thinner than me
and extremely stylish

191
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:34,120
Kidnap him and get him
married to your sister

192
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:35,854
Tata, my dear nincompoops!

193
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:39,407
Which inspector dealt with
the commissioner's murder case?

194
00:15:39,432 --> 00:15:40,474
Me, sir

195
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:43,582
Why haven't you recovered
the mobile he used last?

196
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:45,524
I couldn't find it
in the crime scene, sir

197
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:48,382
I enquired in the neighborhood
But I couldn't find it, sir

198
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:51,796
Serve them tea

199
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:53,529
The new DC is inside, sir

200
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,836
New, right?

201
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:56,901
Duraisingam, sir

202
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,370
What a surprise, sir?

203
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:00,657
- Do you know sir earlier?
- What kind of question is that?!

204
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:03,675
"A lion with momentum
 He is Duraisingam"

205
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,642
My home town is Tuticorin, sir

206
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,738
You ensured Thangaraj
got death penalty

207
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:11,220
You made Bhai and Danny the drug lord
stir porridge in the pans in prison, sir

208
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:12,610
I know everything, sir

209
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:15,201
Sir, how is your wife?

210
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:16,310
He has no family

211
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:17,432
- What?
- He isn't even married

212
00:16:17,457 --> 00:16:19,875
Srinivas, I was very much
in town on his wedding day

213
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:23,837
I have all the cuttings
of his wedding snaps

214
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,534
Want to see?
Shall I show you?

215
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,976
- Constable
- Oh God!

216
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:30,437
Er...er, has your wife
come with you, sir?

217
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:33,077
- No
- Why, sir?

218
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:35,218
- Not with me now
- Why, sir?

219
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:37,495
We got divorced

220
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:38,978
I don't believe this!

221
00:16:39,003 --> 00:16:40,461
Come inside
We can catch up-

222
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:42,694
We can go in and continue

223
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,552
I am Veeram, sir
I leave the forum, sir

224
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,906
I want to meet asst commissioner
Krishnaraj who attended the case

225
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:51,390
He is on medical leave, sir

226
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:54,125
But he'll be in Royal Casino
every night to booze, sir

227
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,275
Do you know for a fact?

228
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,257
Why get worked up for this?

229
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,652
Don't I have to show
I'm working now that I'm here?

230
00:16:59,738 --> 00:17:01,405
Where is Royal Casino bar?

231
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:02,609

232
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:05,434

Just to have a good time

Sir, asst commissioner is inside

234

235
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,083

"King of the jungle, hey!
Lord of all he surveys"

300
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:07,495
If I danced along
just to give him company...

301
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,944
...with no respect,
he made me tend to this horse

302
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:11,617
- Sir?
- This is respect

303
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,790
Aren't you commissioner Veera Babu?

304
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:15,413
Me...commissioner?

305
00:22:15,764 --> 00:22:16,938
Commissioner
Long live!

306
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:18,828
Commissioner
Long live!

307
00:22:20,032 --> 00:22:22,203
I'm not the big C
you make me out to be!

308
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,438
- Joint commissioner
- No

309
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,298
- Assistant commissioner?
- Nope

310
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:28,406
- Deputy?
- Ordinary police constable

311
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:30,785
That's okay
What do you want?

312
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,018
- I came to meet âDoraiâ
- Which Durai?

313
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:35,140
DC Duraisingam
works here, right?

314
00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:36,852
Addressing him without respect?

315
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:39,002
How dare you treat
my boss with scant respect?

316
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:40,750
That's how we talk

317
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:43,473
Sir, your friend has come

318
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:45,263
Who said she is his friend?

319
00:22:45,312 --> 00:22:47,405
Got his autograph, right?
We bonded then

320
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,293
- Does that make him your friend?
- Yes

321
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:51,663
If I click a snap with him,
then a 'closssse' friend!

322
00:22:52,594 --> 00:22:55,677
- Why do you keep coming here?
- Then when should I come where, sir?

323
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:56,533
What do you want?

324
00:22:57,158 --> 00:23:00,483
I like bold police officers
like you very much

325
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:01,630
That's why I befriended you

326
00:23:01,655 --> 00:23:02,809
This friendship won't work

327
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:06,012
- I'm already married
- But aren't you a divorcee?

328
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:08,006
Hey! Who told you all this?

329
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:09,944
Shouldn't be a traitor to men

330
00:23:09,969 --> 00:23:12,719
Shouldn't âtradeâ women
 My grandfather's words of wisdom

331
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:14,176
I'll clobber you

332
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:16,619
Is this how a young girl talks?

333
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:25,283
Yov! Buffalo, will you bring her in
if she claims to be a friend?

334
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:27,307
Men won't be truthful
Women won't be deceitful

335
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:28,623
My grandma's wise words

336
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:29,856
Where's your grandma?

337
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:32,197
Grandmaaaaaa!

338
00:23:32,384 --> 00:23:34,749
He's feeling shy to call me
his friend in front of everyone

339
00:23:34,774 --> 00:23:37,889
But shyness, fear, bashfulness,
shame, timidity, modesty

340
00:23:37,914 --> 00:23:38,629
...are all alien to me

341
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:41,734
Even I don't have
whatever you listed now

342
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:42,972
Bingo!

343
00:23:43,284 --> 00:23:45,576
On the way
drop me at the court

344
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:04,267
Tell me

345
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:07,043
2 check leaves I signed
are missing from my office

346
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:09,890
I didn't specify the amount

347
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,164
Blank checks

348
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:12,646
Isn't it wrong to sign them?

349
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:13,671
I know

350
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,038
First inform the bank
to block the checks

351
00:24:19,145 --> 00:24:21,064
Call everyone in
their office and enquire

352
00:24:21,724 --> 00:24:22,913
But before that...

353
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,562
...ask them to
search thoroughly

354
00:24:24,983 --> 00:24:26,941
This doesn't seem
like a missing case

355
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:30,024
More like it was
deliberately displaced

356
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:43,482
Sir, a complaint has been
lodged against the shops here

357
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,099
It seems they mix cocaine in coffee

358
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:48,254
They add 'snow' in ice cream

359
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,915
Let's taste both
to be doubly sure

360
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:52,682
- Veeram, where's your sir?
- In CMR mall

361
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,911
Our Abhi is missing

362
00:24:56,581 --> 00:24:59,066
Reddy's henchman is
carrying a girl over there

363
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:03,059
My daughter

364
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:04,538
My child...stop!

365
00:25:07,388 --> 00:25:08,596
Where are you taking her?

366
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:10,370
Wait, I say

367
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:11,826
If you're a Customs officer...

368
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:13,059
...do you have 4 arms?

369
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:15,418
You got hold of our container
and refused to let go

370
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:17,090
Better sign this paper now

371
00:25:17,177 --> 00:25:18,209
- Wait here
- I can't sign

372
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:19,485
Give my child back

373
00:25:19,772 --> 00:25:23,547
Knowing it's Reddy's stuff
you still confiscated it?

374
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,261
Sign the papers

375
00:25:30,387 --> 00:25:31,804
Who are you, sir?

376
00:25:34,722 --> 00:25:36,978
Being a police officer
you're supporting a goon?

377
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:39,670
No one in Vizag has the right
to block Reddy's container

378
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,927
Oh gawd!
Abhi...?

379
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:44,114
What's happening here?

380
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:46,425
I won't sign until I know
what is inside that container

381
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,617
- You won't sign, huh?
-  I won't, da

382
00:25:51,695 --> 00:25:53,372
If you don't sign now...

383
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:57,161
...shall I tell him to lower his hand
a few inches below her neck?

384
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:17,850
"A lion gathering momentum
He is Duraisingam"

385
00:26:18,808 --> 00:26:19,933
I was talking, right?

386
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:21,594
Molesting a woman?!

387
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:22,993
Isn't it a disgusting habit?

388
00:26:24,114 --> 00:26:27,196
Besides your mother,
sister and wife...

389
00:26:27,357 --> 00:26:31,150
...will you see all other women
only in a lecherous way?

390
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:33,038
Go

391
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:35,177
Leave now

392
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:38,739
Don't let him go

393
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,209
You dare hit a policeman?

394
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:44,050
What audacity!

395
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:55,162
If you let go of
4 containers now...

396
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:56,959
...we can seize 400 containers

397
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:05,172
Containers have left?

398
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,183
He got the signatures?!

399
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:10,076
Start the car

400
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,795
Hey! Ask that DC to meet me

401
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:23,674
Jalaripeta, âGunâ Ravi's area

402
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:26,222
Can't take any action
without defying him

403
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:28,522
Mr Reddy has come to meet you, sir

404
00:28:29,206 --> 00:28:31,262
- Ask him to come
- You have to go and meet him

405
00:28:32,425 --> 00:28:33,215
I don't understand

406
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,532
Reddy has never stepped
into any police station

407
00:28:35,745 --> 00:28:37,620
Only the officers
will go and meet him

408
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:39,784
Tell him I can't come

409
00:28:47,844 --> 00:28:49,335
DC said he can't come, Reddy

410
00:28:50,887 --> 00:28:51,887
Start the car

411
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,610
- This is DC Duraisingam
- Tell me

412
00:29:02,644 --> 00:29:05,060
I hope you'll understand
if I say just one word

413
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:07,172
No one should know
I'm on your side

414
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:09,140
That's why I didn't
come out to see you

415
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:11,321
I understand

416
00:29:11,346 --> 00:29:12,948
You should come home one day

417
00:29:12,993 --> 00:29:14,035
Certainly

418
00:29:14,231 --> 00:29:16,023
The day we both meet...

419
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,081
...I can assure you will be
a memorable day in your life!

420
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:21,397
- I don't understand
- Maybe your birthday

421
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:22,803
Or your wedding day

422
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:27,974
Not a single soul in the station

423
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,172
What are you eating?

424
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:30,656
- Brown nut ball
- Eat

425
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:34,211
Isn't that a groundnut ball?

426
00:29:34,236 --> 00:29:37,415
This is groundnut ball and
this is its brother brown nut ball

427
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:40,879
Taking me for a royal ride
early in the morning?

428
00:29:40,938 --> 00:29:43,103
You look like a cylinder
wearing pants!

429
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,667
Mocking a senior officer!

430
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:46,822
What is the problem, sir?

431
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:48,805
A groundnut ball
is brown nut ball it seems

432
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,080
He's being sarcastic!
That's why I whacked him

433
00:29:51,198 --> 00:29:53,032
Try this 'Vimala' orange

434
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:56,530
Yov! Isn't this pomelo orange?

435
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:00,820
This is the non-hybrid pomelo orange
That is its sister 'Vimala' orange

436
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,079
Then what about this?

437
00:30:03,123 --> 00:30:04,889
Their mother 'Amala' orange, huh?

438
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:06,913
Is this their grandma
'Pamila' orange?

439
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,755
- Yes, bro
- Don't you know?

440
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,817
Ignorance is bliss for me

441
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,145
You claim to be the brainbox?!

442
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,545
Will you call your brother 'akka'
and sister as uncle?!

443
00:30:16,305 --> 00:30:17,597
Sir, forensic report

444
00:30:18,288 --> 00:30:19,621
In the ballistic investigation...

445
00:30:19,914 --> 00:30:23,372
...bullet in the commissioner's body was
 from an improvised country made gun

446
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,800
Are locally made
weapons in use here?

447
00:30:28,947 --> 00:30:31,072
Ravi from Jalaripeta
deals with this, sir

448
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,248
Sir, Vidya is coming in

449
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,155
Looks like she may be
in love with you

450
00:30:38,197 --> 00:30:39,898
I came only to see you, sir

451
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,146
What-

452
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:42,999
Sitting near me like this
in a public place

453
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:45,855
Then can I sit close to you
in a private place, sir?

454
00:30:46,274 --> 00:30:47,091
Get up

455
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:47,987
GET UP!

456
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,095
- I want to talk to you in private
- Tell me whatever it is right here

457
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,560
I think I have-

458
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:54,368
- You have?
- Love

459
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,013
- I'm NOT in love with you
- No, huh?

460
00:30:57,051 --> 00:30:58,600
Vidya, how could you say this?

461
00:30:58,642 --> 00:31:01,225
You followed him as if you had
fallen in love with him

462
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:02,380
Shameless!

463
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:03,697
First clear out from here

464
00:31:03,802 --> 00:31:04,802
Where, sir?

465
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:06,320
Check where the restroom is

466
00:31:08,974 --> 00:31:10,933
Let me confess the whole truth, sir

467
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:13,689
This is my preliminary
pass certificate

468
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,780
This is my main hall ticket

469
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:17,763
And this is my ID card

470
00:31:18,534 --> 00:31:20,826
I'm preparing for
the Indian Police Service exam

471
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:24,356
I followed you thinking
I can learn something

472
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:25,722
Please settle the account

473
00:31:27,841 --> 00:31:30,694
Why didn't you show your ID card
when you got his autograph?

474
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:32,284
Will your sir accept it at once?

475
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,689
Girls shouldn't come to the railway station
Radio station is taboo for mothers

476
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:39,015
Grandmothers can't step into fire stations
Won't he set his own set of rules?

477
00:31:40,844 --> 00:31:42,427
I want to see you immediately

478
00:31:43,731 --> 00:31:44,897
I'm right here

479
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:51,854
- Here...?
- Our company's guest room

480
00:31:54,889 --> 00:31:56,768
- Where's the rest room?
- Look over there

481
00:31:58,858 --> 00:32:01,729
I asked you directions for the rest room
and you're showing me the toilet

482
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:02,796
What...what?

483
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,014
I can even see bathrooms everywhere

484
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,956
But I am unable to see
any rest room here

485
00:32:22,395 --> 00:32:23,316
Room for pigs!

486
00:32:23,346 --> 00:32:25,069
They have a separate room for pigs!

487
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,925
The other day in
the police station-

488
00:32:26,974 --> 00:32:29,903
I lied to you about
that missing check

489
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,993
I know

490
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,107
I felt like seeing you

491
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:35,209
I needed an excuse, right?

492
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,555
'For a guy to meet a girl...'

493
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,598
'...didn't you say
he needs an excuse?'

494
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:42,735
He went into 406, sir

495
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,383
What are you doing here?

496
00:32:45,408 --> 00:32:47,367
Let me ask you
the same question

497
00:32:47,485 --> 00:32:48,552
I went to the restroom

498
00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:50,169
Rest room?!

499
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,752
I was looking for that wretched
rest room in all the floors

500
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,388
Show me where you took rest

501
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,473
I want to see the rest room

502
00:32:57,513 --> 00:33:00,013
My boss also wants
to take rest there

503
00:33:00,983 --> 00:33:03,025
- Do you know what a restroom is?
- What...?

504
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:08,608
You mean where people poop?

505
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:11,858
Sir, I came looking for yo-

506
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,066
I'll see you

507
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:24,109
Wrong, sir

508
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:26,068
To meet a girl who complained secretly-

509
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:27,954
Not right, sir

510
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,134
Do you know who she is?

511
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,439
My wife

512
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:34,933
You said you were a divorcee?

513
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,318
Bless you, my dear

514
00:33:43,344 --> 00:33:44,232
Welcome, sir

515
00:33:53,257 --> 00:33:58,215
"At last I see you're mine"

516
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,255
"Itâs like Iâve been lifted high"

517
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:10,693
"My dreams have been brought to life"

518
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:18,686
"Girl, the first time I set eyes on you"

519
00:34:18,776 --> 00:34:24,193
"At once I lost myself in your love true"

520
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:28,718
"Only one I asked you, just once'

521
00:34:29,003 --> 00:34:34,211
"I welded you to my soul, my princess"

522
00:34:34,256 --> 00:34:38,423
"Beloved, you are I know"

523
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,293
"Like motherâs unconditional love"

524
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:44,861
"Like a sleepless baby somehow"

525
00:34:44,903 --> 00:34:49,570
"Like the ghost Casper, friendly fellow
my love, with your love you follow"

526
00:34:50,025 --> 00:34:54,859
"Hot tempered and stubborn I was
not to fall in love at all, oâ lass"

527
00:34:54,905 --> 00:35:00,363
"With your expressive eyes you hooked me
My vow tore into tatters, tigress sweety"

528
00:35:00,388 --> 00:35:05,119
"1st time I set eyes on you, on that day"

529
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:10,311
"I gave myself to you right away"

530
00:35:10,662 --> 00:35:14,912
"Only one I asked you just once"

531
00:35:15,495 --> 00:35:20,412
"I fused you to my heart, my princess"

532
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:04,184
"Bright yellow flower, my love-goddess
Step out of your petal into my universe"

533
00:36:04,244 --> 00:36:10,452
"Holding your waist, sweet parakeet,
Come, let me sweep you off your feet"

534
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:16,450
"If you call me,
Iâll go with you readily"

535
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,285
"On a bed of thorns or the silver sky
Iâll walk beside you, Iâll comply"

536
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:27,352
"Not sulking if you didnât see me"

537
00:36:27,444 --> 00:36:32,652
"You won my love with your loyalty"

538
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:38,435
"What mistake shall I do happily
for you to yell at me daily?"

539
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:24,181
"During the day, not seeing you
craving climbs a ladder feeling blue"

540
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:29,289
"I want our nights together
with âdonât disturbâ sign forever"

541
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:34,418
"Only after you breezed into my life
my days are filled with sugar & spice"

542
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:39,623
"To pamper your desires to the T
my passion crosses its boundary"

543
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:44,815
"With your hand linked in mine naturally
Planning the dayâs agenda casually"

544
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:50,331
"To make out with a fervor
To whet appetites for each other"

545
00:37:50,356 --> 00:37:55,815
"I am a policeman, thatâs true
Iâm here now to loot you"

546
00:38:00,968 --> 00:38:05,718
"Love, the first time I set eyes on you"

547
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:11,273
"I accepted you as my address anew"

548
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:15,715
"Only one I asked you just once"

549
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:21,262
"I linked you in my mind, my princess"

550
00:38:33,893 --> 00:38:35,977
When you are newly married...

551
00:38:36,373 --> 00:38:39,928
...I feel bad to send you to a city
that's going through trouble and turmoil

552
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:42,838
If our neighboring State
is asking us to help...

553
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:45,491
...it is a feather in the cap
of Tamil Nadu police, sir

554
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:47,282
If possible ask for a North Indian...

555
00:38:47,307 --> 00:38:50,134
...who doesn't know the language
to be appointed as commissioner, sir

556
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:53,936
If I take you along with me
to a city churning in chaos

557
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:56,071
...I may have to work
under a cloud of worry

558
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:57,908
Just 2 months

559
00:38:58,476 --> 00:38:59,935
You should go
Godspeed

560
00:39:00,225 --> 00:39:03,307
Then you can stay with
your parents these 2 months

561
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:06,116
Maybe you can work
in your dad's office

562
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,356
I've got an idea

563
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:10,282
Instead of Chennai office...

564
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:13,021
...let me stay in the guesthouse
and work in our factory in Vizag

565
00:39:13,147 --> 00:39:15,147
I won't meet you or call you

566
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:17,726
Even if I meet you
I won't identify myself

567
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,424
I'll have the pleasure
of being in the same city with you

568
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:22,992
Okay

569
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,761
I was very particular no one should
know about my family background

570
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:30,950
Even for security purposes

571
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:33,432
...my wife who refused to
remove her wedding chain

572
00:39:33,617 --> 00:39:35,617
...I was forced to say
I had divorced her

573
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:39,136
My wife is the one who is great

574
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:40,434
Head constable has fainted

575
00:39:40,459 --> 00:39:41,831
- Come soon
- What happened?

576
00:39:41,856 --> 00:39:43,398
I want to know
what happened

577
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,208
He complained of
a headache, sir

578
00:39:45,242 --> 00:39:46,844
I got him a glass of tea
and tablet, sir

579
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:47,860
He drank it and fainted

580
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:49,624
How can you treat him here?

581
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:51,315
First take him to
a hospital...fast

582
00:39:51,357 --> 00:39:52,941
- Take care
- Govind, be with him

583
00:39:57,332 --> 00:39:58,624
What tablet did he take?

584
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,934
Here, sir

585
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,375
Look this up in Google

586
00:40:06,827 --> 00:40:08,765
The expiry date has been struck off

587
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:12,307
Sir, this is an Australian tablet

588
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:14,937
How can that be sold...

589
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:16,888
...in some corner tea stall

590
00:40:16,973 --> 00:40:18,259
Find out the tablet's source

591
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:20,096
The supplier and all the details

592
00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:21,488
And let me know

593
00:40:21,513 --> 00:40:22,513
Do a mild enquiry

594
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:23,507
Go in mufti

595
00:40:23,568 --> 00:40:25,359
Who is supplying
this medicine to you?

596
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:26,263
Yes, Srinivas

597
00:40:26,288 --> 00:40:28,371
Baburao from Anakapalle
has supplied it, sir

598
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:30,657
Find out how he got
this tablet in particular

599
00:40:33,185 --> 00:40:34,739
Sir, no proper office or license

600
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:36,371
He is supplying
from a go-down, sir

601
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:38,147
Did you find out
who the supplier is?

602
00:40:38,178 --> 00:40:39,427
His name is Prabhakar

603
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:40,667
Reddy's man, sir

604
00:40:42,121 --> 00:40:43,288
Don't enquire further

605
00:40:49,386 --> 00:40:51,386
- What happened?
- Murder case

606
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:54,746
He said he would be back
after attending to it

607
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,046
Yes, Krishnaraj

608
00:40:56,136 --> 00:40:58,302
Someone has murdered
MLA Malleswar Rao, sir

609
00:41:00,536 --> 00:41:01,462
But he never came back

610
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,091
Krishnaraj claims
he never called that day

611
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:11,215
He has come to meet
the commissioner thrice

612
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:12,304
Do you recognize him?

613
00:41:12,474 --> 00:41:14,557
So many people
meet him in his office

614
00:41:14,612 --> 00:41:16,071
How will I know all of them?

615
00:41:17,524 --> 00:41:19,566
Come here, dear

616
00:41:20,382 --> 00:41:21,841
No...wait

617
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:22,944
Go inside

618
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,599
Don't stand here

619
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,913
Why are you calling my children?

620
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:29,624
No need, stop all this
I don't want anything

621
00:41:29,983 --> 00:41:31,691
My dead husband
won't walk in now

622
00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:32,758
Why are you reacting like this?

623
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:35,074
That assistant commissioner
came here to enquire

624
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:38,292
He asked a few questions
for the sake of asking

625
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:40,650
Pretended to feel sad
and made a pass at my girls

626
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:44,603
Won't a mother know if he was being
sympathetic or lecherous?

627
00:41:45,683 --> 00:41:48,600
As soon as my kids finish school
we will leave this place

628
00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:52,860
I don't want any of you knocking at
my door in your khaki uniform please

629
00:41:55,637 --> 00:41:57,595
Commissioner's wife is lying, sir

630
00:41:57,668 --> 00:41:58,835
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir

631
00:41:58,914 --> 00:42:01,699
Krishnaraj never called
the commissioner at all

632
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,375
We have copies of both their bills
Not registered in either, sir

633
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:06,621
Krishnaraj was insistent
we should check the reports

634
00:42:06,683 --> 00:42:08,141
The report favors his statement

635
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:09,755
That's why I suspect him even more

636
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:13,487
When I asked his wife a question
she looked at me with a flash of anger

637
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,028
It was loaded with honesty

638
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:17,077
I believe in emotions
rather than evidence

639
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,784
They have used their clout
to tamper network reports

640
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:21,708
Is that possible, sir?

641
00:42:21,765 --> 00:42:24,529
In recent years, with the help of
reports from network companies

642
00:42:24,554 --> 00:42:25,971
...we have been investigating

643
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,446
Why can't they go wrong?

644
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:29,247
But the top level
has to permit this, sir

645
00:42:29,307 --> 00:42:30,714
Why won't the top level agree?

646
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:33,037
A company that earns 100 billion

647
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:36,040
They hold meetings to discuss
how they can increase their turnover

648
00:42:36,116 --> 00:42:37,283
Reducing their profit...

649
00:42:37,463 --> 00:42:41,326
...do they reduce their call charges
 to their customers by 50%?

650
00:42:43,586 --> 00:42:44,920
Let us not blame anyone

651
00:42:45,093 --> 00:42:46,634
But we can suspect someone?

652
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,469
Sir, he hacked UBC bank's system
and stole Rs 1,800,000

653
00:43:01,672 --> 00:43:04,588
They have morphed girls' photos
and sent them through WhatsAp-

654
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:07,600
- Send them away
- They should be attacked by animals

655
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:08,613
Will you shut your gob?

656
00:43:08,638 --> 00:43:10,102
You can be used instead!

657
00:43:10,216 --> 00:43:12,383
He hacked Cel Tel network's server and-

658
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:13,236
What did you do?

659
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:16,669
They billed me wrongly
for Rs 2000  instead of Rs 200

660
00:43:17,285 --> 00:43:20,285
My attempts to plead and
persuade them were futile

661
00:43:20,328 --> 00:43:21,620
So he hacked their network

662
00:43:21,645 --> 00:43:23,426
4 million customers
were billed only 2 bucks

663
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,962
The company suffered a huge loss

664
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,352
Soooper, man

665
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:30,496
Claiming he is linked to
the commissioner's murder

666
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,820
...take him under our custody

667
00:43:33,553 --> 00:43:34,887
You there! Wait

668
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:36,853
What crime did you commit?

669
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,864
We gave connection
to aunties online

670
00:43:38,925 --> 00:43:40,258
- Gas connection?
- No

671
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:41,865
- Cable connection?
- No

672
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,144
- Current connection?
- NO

673
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:45,635
- Water connection?
- 'Matter' connection!

674
00:43:46,149 --> 00:43:47,315
What do you mean?

675
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:49,744
Aunties bouncing with drive
for uncles bugged with life

676
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:51,894
Aunties with a love-spark
for uncles who are dark

677
00:43:51,947 --> 00:43:54,154
Girls who are freaky
for guys who are free

678
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:55,882
We connected unlike poles to attract

679
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,342
'Positive Individual Making-out Progress'
in a multi-level indeed

680
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:02,021
If you help us
in this investigation

681
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:03,761
...you can be out
within 2 months-

682
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:04,786
What should I do?

683
00:44:22,764 --> 00:44:25,135
At 10:15 a call was made from
the asst commissioner's phone...

684
00:44:25,217 --> 00:44:26,926
...to the commissioner
for 31 seconds

685
00:44:26,986 --> 00:44:29,277
It has been erased from
the network 12 hours later

686
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:35,929
At 11:15 commissioner's signal
was at the crime spot, right?

687
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,633
Madurawada Towers
SE 620.10 meters

688
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:42,946
At that particular time at the crime spot
can you check for any other signal?

689
00:44:47,788 --> 00:44:50,205
Only 1 number has flashed
from a distance of 300 meters

690
00:44:50,277 --> 00:44:51,881
Neared at 11:12 and left at 11:16

691
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,697
Sustained for 4 minutes
In the name of Mallaya

692
00:44:54,743 --> 00:44:55,993
Is Mallaya the murderer-

693
00:44:56,091 --> 00:44:59,175
According to forensic reports
4 people are involved in this murder

694
00:45:00,053 --> 00:45:02,428
Like how Krishnaraj's number
was erased from the call list

695
00:45:02,453 --> 00:45:04,945
...can't other numbers be erased
from the location history?

696
00:45:06,201 --> 00:45:07,325
Can it be retrieved?

697
00:45:11,814 --> 00:45:14,207
That chap Selva who tried
a face-off the day I joined duty

698
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,503
- Shall we taunt him face to face?
- Will do, sir

699
00:45:16,564 --> 00:45:17,514
Hey netizen!

700
00:45:20,158 --> 00:45:23,241
From this number some female
has texted me, 'I love you'

701
00:45:23,376 --> 00:45:25,357
I tried calling her back 70-80 times

702
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:26,395
She didn't pick my call

703
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,670
Can you find out her name,
the city she resides in-

704
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:33,237
You stuck the paper under my nose
before I could furnish all the details

705
00:45:33,262 --> 00:45:34,520
Pushpa from Vijayawada

706
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:36,125
DOB 7th November 1994

707
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:37,448
Parents are Krishna and Shanthi

708
00:45:37,622 --> 00:45:38,452
Wait, man

709
00:45:38,506 --> 00:45:40,014
She sent this to 2400 numbers

710
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:42,844
They have all called her
70-80 times daily

711
00:45:43,187 --> 00:45:45,055
180000 'missed' calls to that number

712
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,246
- So many?
- 12 people are paying her phone bill

713
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:49,334
Those 12 numbers are
boys 20-25 years old

714
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:50,537
Daily 1 number from Delhi

715
00:45:50,562 --> 00:45:51,557
From Delhi?

716
00:45:52,025 --> 00:45:54,812
This list seems to extend
up to North India

717
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:57,508
In the midst of traditional
home bound wives...

718
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,196
...what a bimbo
with loose morals!

719
00:46:01,928 --> 00:46:03,012
Hello, sir

720
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:04,129
Come in, sir

721
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:08,354
Vidya, sir is entering Zoom bar
Come if you can, to meet your star!

722
00:46:08,379 --> 00:46:09,755
I'll be there
in 4 minutes flat

723
00:46:10,012 --> 00:46:11,375
What would you like to order, sir?

724
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:19,171
You haven't taken
the IPS exam as yet

725
00:46:19,287 --> 00:46:21,120
Trying to sweeten up sir
with your salute?

726
00:46:21,298 --> 00:46:23,423
I need your signature
in this application, sir

727
00:46:23,453 --> 00:46:25,633
- What is it?
- I intend learning to shoot

728
00:46:25,698 --> 00:46:29,239
The Training academy wants
an attestation from a police officer

729
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,456
Girls shouldn't be here

730
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:33,860
Sir, Selva has come

731
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:35,296
Go, leave now

732
00:46:37,415 --> 00:46:39,208
- Good afternoon, sir
- Sit down

733
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:42,678
Have a beer

734
00:46:44,362 --> 00:46:46,904
Regarding the murder of
the commissioner a year ago

735
00:46:47,089 --> 00:46:48,881
I know you are
in no way connected

736
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,935
But you know the man
connected with the murder

737
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:54,765
Why are you linking me to this
when I am least connected?

738
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:56,373
Without anyone's knowledge...

739
00:46:56,957 --> 00:46:58,276
...whisper in my ear

740
00:46:58,372 --> 00:47:00,123
You know I am
one of Reddy's men?

741
00:47:00,178 --> 00:47:01,178
I am also on his side

742
00:47:01,223 --> 00:47:02,490
Why do you bring him into this?

743
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:04,095
Playing politics with me?

744
00:47:04,234 --> 00:47:07,192
Tamil Nadu police cannot
do any damn thing here

745
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:09,678
Bloody mongrel

746
00:47:09,808 --> 00:47:12,104
You think you're worthy enough
to talk about Tamil Nadu police?

747
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:15,404
This gun does not discern its target
based on which state or what status

748
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:17,669
Only what is right and wrong

749
00:47:17,694 --> 00:47:18,628
Shall I shoot you?

750
00:47:18,653 --> 00:47:20,207
Shall I?

751
00:47:20,232 --> 00:47:25,315
I could have closed the file on you
for trying to kill me the day I joined duty

752
00:47:25,585 --> 00:47:27,017
What are you staring blankly for?

753
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:28,506
It was you, right?

754
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:31,026
Didn't you send your thugs that day?

755
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:35,699
You told them my blue shirt was
an excuse for you to target me

756
00:47:36,845 --> 00:47:39,636
We will pretend we don't know
even if we were well aware

757
00:47:39,707 --> 00:47:42,332
And you'll keep thinking you fooled us?

758
00:47:43,249 --> 00:47:46,499
He must have killed the commissioner
You'll get evidence in his house

759
00:47:52,332 --> 00:47:54,832
What do you want, sir?
You are barging in to my house?

760
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:01,372
Sir, how can you come-

761
00:48:05,742 --> 00:48:07,951
- Look in that rice bin
- Yes, sir

762
00:48:08,827 --> 00:48:10,259
Don't! That's an offering for God

763
00:48:10,284 --> 00:48:12,077
There is nothing in there

764
00:48:26,775 --> 00:48:30,275
Entire stash is Australian dollars
Worth almost 700 to 800 million

765
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,776
Who are you, man?

766
00:48:32,382 --> 00:48:33,758
Gun in the rice bin

767
00:48:34,107 --> 00:48:35,940
A trunk filled with
Australian currency

768
00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:37,166
How did all this-

769
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:41,210
Duraisingam, do not enquire
about that money or the gun

770
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:43,663
That is 'hawala' money
from Australia

771
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:46,173
If you want, take a couple of bundles

772
00:48:46,198 --> 00:48:47,572
I'll take it, Reddy

773
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:50,428
When I need it
I'll do the needful

774
00:48:51,437 --> 00:48:52,479
Let's go

775
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,342
Hey! Take a bundle of Australian dollar
Get a cup of coffee for each one of them

776
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:04,939
Duraisingam barged into Selva's house
without knowing he is one of our men

777
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:06,180
We can trust him

778
00:49:06,253 --> 00:49:08,461
By the way
how did you find out?

779
00:49:08,573 --> 00:49:13,990
4 cameras belonging to my company
monitoring Vizag city are active, right?

780
00:49:20,746 --> 00:49:22,621
Then money must be
dispatched from here

781
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,871
Something doesn't fit right

782
00:49:23,933 --> 00:49:26,449
Srinivas, something has been
written about our boss

783
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:27,694
Read it

784
00:49:33,062 --> 00:49:35,478
- What is it?
- You are closely associated with Reddy

785
00:49:35,595 --> 00:49:37,013
It seems you accept
bribes from him

786
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:40,019
Vizag city has deteriorated
after your deputation

787
00:49:41,088 --> 00:49:41,964
Not only that, sir

788
00:49:42,056 --> 00:49:44,889
In room # 406...er-

789
00:49:45,505 --> 00:49:47,625
...you were seen with a girl

790
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,605
Who the hell wrote that?

791
00:49:48,644 --> 00:49:49,769
Someone called Agni

792
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:03,511
If we nab Agni and beat him up
we can get to the bottom of this, sir

793
00:50:03,622 --> 00:50:05,122
- Yov! Go, do it
- No, don't

794
00:50:05,463 --> 00:50:06,999
Only what seemed true
has been written

795
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,534
As soon as we knew a police officer
was coming from Tamil Nadu

796
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:12,134
...to write a thrilling article about him

797
00:50:12,555 --> 00:50:15,596
...our chief editor from Hyderabad
sent her here to investigate

798
00:50:20,611 --> 00:50:23,819
Her work should
be kept a secret

799
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:32,260
At first I thought he must be
a skirt chaser and I spoke differently

800
00:50:32,286 --> 00:50:33,744
But he's very strict

801
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:36,070
So I lied saying
I am taking the IPS exam

802
00:50:36,157 --> 00:50:37,406
He believed me at once

803
00:50:37,515 --> 00:50:40,306
'A complaint has been lodged
against CBI officer Duraisingam'

804
00:50:42,896 --> 00:50:44,063
What do you mean, sir?

805
00:50:44,122 --> 00:50:46,288
Please come to Vizag immediately

806
00:50:48,477 --> 00:50:50,810
In my next article
these photos will be published

807
00:50:50,973 --> 00:50:53,503
Then this man will
scurry back to Tamil Nadu

808
00:50:53,552 --> 00:50:54,844
I heard about the article

809
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:56,439
I'm going to my hometown

810
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,221
Your reputation must be
damaged by now

811
00:50:58,383 --> 00:51:01,216
If you want to cover up
arrest 10 of my men

812
00:51:01,822 --> 00:51:03,072
I'll arrest, Reddy

813
00:51:03,615 --> 00:51:04,615
I will

814
00:51:05,715 --> 00:51:07,799
Why is she coming here
now of all times?

815
00:51:07,963 --> 00:51:10,254
Sir, I have come to Vizag
to meet you

816
00:51:11,012 --> 00:51:12,870
Come immediately to
Home minister's guest house

817
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:14,645
Tell Subbu to send Mallaya's details

818
00:51:17,505 --> 00:51:18,588
Come here

819
00:51:21,461 --> 00:51:22,961
Don't come this side hereafter

820
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:24,602
Someone has maligned me

821
00:51:24,862 --> 00:51:25,945
If you come here...

822
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:27,384
...your reputation
will be in shreds too

823
00:51:33,803 --> 00:51:36,220
Duraisingam, what is happening here?

824
00:51:36,516 --> 00:51:38,474
I am unable to digest
whatever he told me

825
00:51:39,131 --> 00:51:41,922
No development whatsoever
in the commissioner's murder case

826
00:51:42,216 --> 00:51:45,134
You've not arrested
even 1 culprit so far

827
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:47,379
Just arresting a culprit
doesn't make one a police officer

828
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,896
A smart cop should prevent crimes

829
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:53,364
The constable and sub inspector here
can arrest if that's what you want

830
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:55,352
Why should I come here
from Tamil Nadu, sir?

831
00:51:55,492 --> 00:51:58,076
- I don't follow
- My route is different, sir

832
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,624
Only now I have scattered the puffed rice
for the fishes in the sea to take the bait

833
00:52:01,736 --> 00:52:03,361
Very soon I'll hook them

834
00:52:04,298 --> 00:52:07,715
The day will soon dawn for me to expose
the 4th lion in the police symbol

835
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:10,222
You won't find a single criminal
in the city on that day

836
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:11,832
I understand, Duraisingam

837
00:52:11,891 --> 00:52:13,599
In another week,
I'll complete my task

838
00:52:13,654 --> 00:52:15,804
I'll arrest all those involved
in the commissioner's murder

839
00:52:15,874 --> 00:52:18,331
I'll submit my file and
return to Tamil Nadu, sir

840
00:52:19,564 --> 00:52:20,925
Forensic officer called, sir

841
00:52:20,977 --> 00:52:22,943
2 months ago, they have
killed 2 security officers

842
00:52:23,065 --> 00:52:25,949
The bullets from their bodies and
the commissioner's match, sir

843
00:52:26,154 --> 00:52:28,807
- What about Mallaya's details?
- He is Mr Krishnaraj's driver, sir?

844
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:32,146
The day after the murder, he went
on medical leave to his hometown

845
00:52:32,237 --> 00:52:33,864
Medical leave
the very next day

846
00:52:33,912 --> 00:52:36,620
- Which is his home town?
- Doospeta near Vijayanagar

847
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,928
What's wrong?

848
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:50,244
A gross injustice, sir

849
00:52:50,345 --> 00:52:52,929
They killed the commissioner
right in front of my eyes

850
00:52:53,428 --> 00:52:56,469
On that night, I went along
with Mr Krishnaraj, sir

851
00:52:56,511 --> 00:52:59,553
He asked me to stop the car
a little distance away and he went alone

852
00:52:59,578 --> 00:53:02,828
I waited for quite a while, so I went to
check if there was any problem, sir

853
00:53:02,853 --> 00:53:05,561
At that time, commissioner was
driving the car by himself

854
00:53:08,378 --> 00:53:09,921
How was he killed?

855
00:53:10,472 --> 00:53:11,848
Only you are here?

856
00:53:14,345 --> 00:53:15,887
What's happening here?

857
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:19,311
You didn't pay heed
to my warning, right?

858
00:53:19,336 --> 00:53:20,711
'They were arguing vehemently'

859
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,462
' I couldn't hear
anything they spoke'

860
00:53:22,928 --> 00:53:25,678
Wait and watch, tomorrow
all of you will be counting bars

861
00:53:41,412 --> 00:53:44,371
I thought Reddy must be
involved somehow in this case

862
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:46,112
But he is the main culprit

863
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:48,292
Sir, don't include me
as a witness

864
00:53:48,398 --> 00:53:50,331
They will bury me alive
with my family, sir

865
00:53:50,399 --> 00:53:51,482
You be silent for now

866
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:53,105
First come and join duty

867
00:53:56,047 --> 00:53:58,463
- Yes, Srinivas
- Mallaya's details match, sir

868
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,422
Signals of all 4 men are
from Madurawada tower

869
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,823
In the same 30Â°
620 meters point

870
00:54:03,148 --> 00:54:05,898
After 12 hours they erased
the call and location history

871
00:54:06,006 --> 00:54:08,589
...they have modified it as being
in their respective houses

872
00:54:11,753 --> 00:54:14,961
They know to influence networks
And to collapse data by hacking

873
00:54:15,107 --> 00:54:16,732
How can Reddy be so intelligent?

874
00:54:35,044 --> 00:54:37,461
This is the complete list
of criminals in Vizag

875
00:54:38,564 --> 00:54:41,269
From pickpockets, bandits,
thugs who steal electricity...

876
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:42,649
...to commissioner's assassin

877
00:54:42,692 --> 00:54:44,233
I've listed all their names

878
00:54:45,461 --> 00:54:48,211
By this evening
we will arrest all of them

879
00:54:58,777 --> 00:55:03,211
"In a different league altogether
Eye for eye, measure for measure"

880
00:55:07,254 --> 00:55:11,336
"A lion in form magnetic
Duraisingam w(e)aves his magic"

881
00:55:15,461 --> 00:55:19,461
"The lion that creates mayhem
Mastermind Duraisingam"

882
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:21,278
"Sends shivers in every hoodlum"

883
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,902
"Come and get 'em
Throw a tantrum"

884
00:55:24,252 --> 00:55:25,336
Nab all of them

885
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:31,878
Are you taking any action against
the reporter who wrote this?

886
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,653
I believe the police is
arresting all your men

887
00:55:34,678 --> 00:55:36,070
I was the one
who instructed him

888
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:37,429
That DC is on our side

889
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:41,935
"On a covert rampage
with cloud and courage"

890
00:55:48,602 --> 00:55:50,435
He is arresting our men, Reddy

891
00:55:58,249 --> 00:55:59,374
Hello, tell me

892
00:56:11,814 --> 00:56:13,480
DC isn't picking up the phone

893
00:56:15,391 --> 00:56:16,415
Let go of me, sir

894
00:56:16,696 --> 00:56:18,112
Marijuana in his laptop bag, sir

895
00:56:24,002 --> 00:56:26,201
I am arresting you for
murdering the commissioner

896
00:56:26,226 --> 00:56:27,893
This is the network's original report

897
00:56:27,962 --> 00:56:29,712
This is the report
modified by you!

898
00:56:29,815 --> 00:56:31,773
You know I'm Reddy's man, right?

899
00:56:31,861 --> 00:56:33,736
Aren't you ashamed to say this?

900
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:36,785
- Why did you arrest Mr Krishnaraj
- I'll tell you by this evening

901
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:40,102
"Duraisingam on the warpath
working in suppressed wrath"

902
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:44,931
"Waiting to pounce
24x7 on his rounds"

903
00:56:46,729 --> 00:56:47,729
Duraisingam

904
00:56:48,394 --> 00:56:51,640
Why did you arrest inspector Prakash
and asst commissioner Krishnaraj?

905
00:56:51,695 --> 00:56:57,944
No DC, JC, commissioner, Home minister
or Chief minister has asked me this

906
00:56:58,044 --> 00:56:59,377
You are a criminal

907
00:56:59,544 --> 00:57:00,794
You dare ask me this?

908
00:57:00,819 --> 00:57:02,302
Hey police!

909
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:04,724
The cops in your department
thrive on my perks

910
00:57:04,894 --> 00:57:06,225
And wag their tails like dogs!

911
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,834
I'm not a wolf that preys
on anything that catches my eye

912
00:57:08,985 --> 00:57:11,527
I am a lion that hunts
only when I am hungry

913
00:57:11,706 --> 00:57:14,004
I'm hungry enough
to kill anyone now

914
00:57:14,085 --> 00:57:17,002
In such a frenzy
I'll prey on anything I get

915
00:57:17,027 --> 00:57:18,244
Whoever stands before me...

916
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:20,060
...I'll trample him
and walk away

917
00:57:23,432 --> 00:57:25,807
Sir, what is the reason
for this sudden action?

918
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:33,308
Selva, DC is on his way
to 'encounter' you

919
00:57:33,373 --> 00:57:34,540
Somehow escape

920
00:57:35,836 --> 00:57:37,252
Police...run

921
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:43,137
Press and Media
don't come this way

922
00:57:43,162 --> 00:57:44,045
He is armed

923
00:57:46,436 --> 00:57:50,379
"Hot and happening
Duraisingam the Lion-king"

924
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:52,640
Hot coffee in Australian dollars

925
00:57:52,745 --> 00:57:55,036
- Shall I give it to you steaming hot?
- Don't

926
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:57,834
I heard you roam around here
like demon Narakasura's duplicate

927
00:57:57,892 --> 00:58:00,434
If I shoot you many here
will celebrate Deepavali!

928
00:58:04,252 --> 00:58:06,987
You 'encountered' Beemli Selva
Did he kill the commissioner, sir?

929
00:58:10,794 --> 00:58:12,294
Selva is dead, huh?

930
00:58:17,491 --> 00:58:19,701
- Everything went wrong
- How could you, Vidya?

931
00:58:21,169 --> 00:58:24,088
- Can you tell who killed the commissioner?
- No, not now

932
00:58:26,758 --> 00:58:28,466
- What happened?
- Ravi escaped, sir

933
00:58:31,522 --> 00:58:33,545
- Bro, stop the Press
- What happened?

934
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:34,903
Everything has gone wrong

935
00:58:43,965 --> 00:58:45,132
Hey! Come, I say

936
00:58:45,961 --> 00:58:48,628
When Reddy returns
your chapter will be closed

937
00:58:51,415 --> 00:58:53,540
I heard you're on your way
to arrest Reddy

938
00:58:54,395 --> 00:58:56,520
If you want your 1 day action
to be successful...

939
00:58:56,637 --> 00:58:57,706
...don't arrest him now

940
00:58:58,503 --> 00:59:01,461
Find out why he killed
the commissioner

941
00:59:01,547 --> 00:59:03,364
If you arrest him
with proper evidence

942
00:59:03,389 --> 00:59:05,009
...he'll be in prison
for the rest of his life

943
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:16,961
He must be right

944
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:23,836
Where's 'Andhra Today' office?

945
00:59:23,836 --> 00:59:25,794
- Jagadambal circle, sir
- Let's go

946
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:42,829
Who wrote this?

947
00:59:44,311 --> 00:59:45,520
That's Media ethics!

948
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:46,979
It's confidential

949
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:06,950
What...?

950
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,125
Investigative journalism, huh?

951
01:00:09,548 --> 01:00:11,461
Are you doing an undercover operation?

952
01:00:11,637 --> 01:00:14,121
Follow a criminal if you want to
write an investigative article

953
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,982
Watch any politician
who is a crook

954
01:00:16,114 --> 01:00:18,031
Instead of that
you followed me

955
01:00:18,435 --> 01:00:21,435
You've written who was with me
in room 406 in a scandalous way

956
01:00:21,635 --> 01:00:23,150
It could have been
my parents, right?

957
01:00:23,374 --> 01:00:24,957
Could have been
a relative of mine

958
01:00:25,015 --> 01:00:26,724
You can only think crooked, huh?

959
01:00:27,638 --> 01:00:29,854
To nab 10 criminals,
we'll suspect 2 good souls

960
01:00:29,879 --> 01:00:31,962
To save 1 good man
we'll free 2 criminals

961
01:00:32,171 --> 01:00:33,755
How will you understand all this?

962
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,838
I won't even let any stranger
anywhere near me

963
01:00:37,474 --> 01:00:39,588
Just because you wanted to
take up an IPS course

964
01:00:39,653 --> 01:00:41,611
...I believed you
without any doubt

965
01:00:42,544 --> 01:00:43,961
You've humiliated me

966
01:00:48,487 --> 01:00:51,903
You've followed a police officer and
prevented him from doing his duty

967
01:00:53,544 --> 01:00:54,920
Published false information

968
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:57,420
Ruined a police officer's reputation
defamed him with slander

969
01:01:00,146 --> 01:01:00,595
Come along

970
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,563
"He's my hero"

971
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:08,301
"Now I'm feeling like a fool"

972
01:01:09,419 --> 01:01:11,335
"All I ever wanted"

973
01:01:11,382 --> 01:01:13,107
"All I ever needed"

974
01:01:13,132 --> 01:01:16,048
"He drives me bloody crazy"

975
01:01:16,127 --> 01:01:18,961
"He's my Zorro"

976
01:01:20,696 --> 01:01:23,612
"All the ways he makes me feel"

977
01:01:24,521 --> 01:01:26,647
Do you agree to pay
Rs 1500 as penalty?

978
01:01:26,672 --> 01:01:28,839
"And I will wait forever"

979
01:01:28,891 --> 01:01:31,623
"Tell him that Iâm ready"

980
01:01:31,648 --> 01:01:34,648
"Hurt and hollow"

981
01:01:36,143 --> 01:01:37,977
"That's the way he makes me feel"

982
01:01:38,095 --> 01:01:40,669
Your reputation is also at stake

983
01:01:40,753 --> 01:01:42,336
Are you behaving like an adult?

984
01:01:42,462 --> 01:01:44,336
"And I will wait forever"

985
01:01:44,392 --> 01:01:47,476
"I know my love is steady"

986
01:01:54,686 --> 01:01:55,669
What do you want?

987
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:56,999
Why did you come here?

988
01:01:58,586 --> 01:02:00,128
"He's the one for me"

989
01:02:00,252 --> 01:02:01,961
I came to express my love

990
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:05,553
"He will always be
the only one for me"

991
01:02:06,373 --> 01:02:09,832
"He is my Mr Right
Every single day and night"

992
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:14,228
"He is the only one for me"

993
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:16,503
"I wanna wanna need you"

994
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:18,320
"I am never gonna miss you"

995
01:02:18,345 --> 01:02:20,345
"I wanna wanna need you"

996
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,370
"I am never gonna miss you"

997
01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:24,169
"I wanna wanna need you"

998
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:25,836
"I am never gonna miss you"

999
01:02:26,211 --> 01:02:27,252
Hey! Don't follow

1000
01:02:27,252 --> 01:02:28,503
Stop the vehicle

1001
01:02:28,503 --> 01:02:30,211
You sit, sir
I'll take care

1002
01:02:31,496 --> 01:02:32,419
Listen

1003
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:34,252
He is married
Don't unnecessarily-

1004
01:02:34,294 --> 01:02:36,336
What's your problem?
Get lost!

1005
01:02:38,786 --> 01:02:41,961
Reddy, DC barged into our office,
bashed up everyone and took them

1006
01:02:42,143 --> 01:02:43,727
Arrested everyone, Reddy

1007
01:02:44,381 --> 01:02:46,339
Reddy, you told me
DC was your man?

1008
01:02:46,723 --> 01:02:48,473
He has killed Selvam now

1009
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:52,437
He bought my trust
and backstabbed me

1010
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:53,657
I won't spare him

1011
01:02:53,865 --> 01:02:55,490
I won't spare his life

1012
01:02:58,329 --> 01:02:59,493
Ignore Agni, sir

1013
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:01,824
That guy who pointed out
your whereabouts...

1014
01:03:01,877 --> 01:03:02,713
...first we must nab him

1015
01:03:02,749 --> 01:03:03,832
Hey...hey...listen

1016
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,963
The lion is in a relaxed mood

1017
01:03:05,988 --> 01:03:07,281
Why is this rat
getting rattled?

1018
01:03:07,319 --> 01:03:10,544
Veeram, I am so boiling mad,
if I get hold of that spineless scum

1019
01:03:10,572 --> 01:03:11,864
...I'll take my gun and-

1020
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:14,348
I'll bash with a bang
My bullet won't boomerang

1021
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:16,050
Dishum-dishum
Dumeel...dum!

1022
01:03:16,198 --> 01:03:17,674
Should smash his skull
with a solid stone, sir

1023
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:18,964
Stone won't do

1024
01:03:18,989 --> 01:03:20,922
Nail his head with nails
Not 1/2" but 5â long

1025
01:03:20,947 --> 01:03:22,739
Poleaxe him from
his mouth to his bum!

1026
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:26,461
Sir, talk like a respectful policeman
You're behaving like a real scumbag

1027
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:28,095
How dare you call me a scumbag?

1028
01:03:28,165 --> 01:03:30,498
If I take out my gun
and bang bang bang-

1029
01:03:33,398 --> 01:03:35,717
Looks like your office has
a butterfly flitting colorfully

1030
01:03:35,742 --> 01:03:37,700
Nothing like that, sir

1031
01:03:37,936 --> 01:03:39,478
- Sir...?
- Yes, sir

1032
01:03:39,557 --> 01:03:40,326
Tell me, sir

1033
01:03:40,351 --> 01:03:42,934
I believe someone is coming
and professing her love

1034
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:45,115
Looks like you get
all the updates

1035
01:03:45,412 --> 01:03:46,819
Want to know
who is aiding me?

1036
01:03:46,862 --> 01:03:47,862
No, not necessary

1037
01:03:52,401 --> 01:03:55,360
Subbu, looks like you are
making unnecessary calls!

1038
01:03:55,601 --> 01:03:57,893
Sirrrr! Was she sooper mad at you?

1039
01:03:58,828 --> 01:04:00,260
If your wife isn't possessive...

1040
01:04:00,313 --> 01:04:01,688
...life will be boring

1041
01:04:03,747 --> 01:04:06,079
We missed only this chap
in our investigation

1042
01:04:06,186 --> 01:04:07,520
If we get hold of him...

1043
01:04:07,586 --> 01:04:09,336
...we'll know the motive
for the murder

1044
01:04:09,475 --> 01:04:10,704
Why do you think so negative?

1045
01:04:10,729 --> 01:04:11,749
His details will-

1046
01:04:11,774 --> 01:04:13,311
He has met the commissioner thrice

1047
01:04:13,336 --> 01:04:15,338
But why is his name missing
in the visitor's record?

1048
01:04:15,411 --> 01:04:17,065
His name has been concealed

1049
01:04:17,252 --> 01:04:18,196
True, sir, but-

1050
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,888
In case he's above suspicion...

1051
01:04:20,988 --> 01:04:23,711
...wouldn't he have attended
the commissioner's funeral, right?

1052
01:04:24,169 --> 01:04:27,336
Get the footage of commissioner's funeral
from all the TV channels

1053
01:04:40,102 --> 01:04:41,102
Zoom that picture

1054
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:42,419
He has come, sir

1055
01:04:43,194 --> 01:04:44,693
The man standing next to him is...

1056
01:04:44,718 --> 01:04:47,259
...headmaster of the Govt school
in Madurawada, sir

1057
01:04:51,238 --> 01:04:52,906
He's the headmaster's friend

1058
01:04:52,961 --> 01:04:54,919
He's a teacher in the same school

1059
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,309
Tell me

1060
01:05:06,505 --> 01:05:08,380
I need to talk to you alone

1061
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:13,641
They killed him, sir

1062
01:05:14,815 --> 01:05:16,292
Killed them ruthlessly

1063
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,503
Not just the commissioner

1064
01:05:19,532 --> 01:05:22,407
They killed 32 children
including my granddaughter

1065
01:05:24,665 --> 01:05:26,707
On that day in my school
after the 2nd bell

1066
01:05:26,961 --> 01:05:29,085
'...kids were playing in the ground'

1067
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:30,711
'At that time...'

1068
01:05:30,832 --> 01:05:33,056
'...in Madhurwada dump yard
next to our school'

1069
01:05:33,249 --> 01:05:34,783
'...the trash was being burnt'

1070
01:05:35,055 --> 01:05:38,077
'The smoke slowly swept
 towards our school'

1071
01:05:38,232 --> 01:05:39,857
'Our kids fainted, sir'

1072
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:42,353
Sir, the kids have fainted

1073
01:05:50,227 --> 01:05:51,728
Sir, this is your granddaughter

1074
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:55,336
Oh God! What happened to my child?

1075
01:05:55,971 --> 01:05:58,981
Officers from the Corporation
and Pollution department came

1076
01:05:59,175 --> 01:06:01,836
Politicians wandered around here and there

1077
01:06:01,902 --> 01:06:03,944
But 15 days later
the Press reported it as...

1078
01:06:04,495 --> 01:06:08,453
'Student dies due to food poisoning
in mid-day meal scheme'

1079
01:06:09,434 --> 01:06:11,461
I reported this news to
the commissioner

1080
01:06:14,681 --> 01:06:16,264
He called me after a week

1081
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:18,878
Many top leaders
are involved in this

1082
01:06:19,328 --> 01:06:20,912
Don't file a complaint

1083
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:23,048
I've arranged for
a Press meet tomorrow

1084
01:06:23,173 --> 01:06:24,465
Please attend the meet

1085
01:06:24,746 --> 01:06:26,605
Next day neither did
the Press meet happen

1086
01:06:27,294 --> 01:06:28,586
Nor was he alive!

1087
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:32,127
The day you arrived I came
to share this news with you

1088
01:06:32,341 --> 01:06:34,290
'Am I here to investigate
the commissioner's murder?'

1089
01:06:34,315 --> 01:06:35,939
'The way you behaved that day...'

1090
01:06:36,132 --> 01:06:37,794
'...I just went back'

1091
01:06:40,248 --> 01:06:42,107
'Without knowing why...'

1092
01:06:42,588 --> 01:06:45,505
'...32 innocent children
lost their lives'

1093
01:06:46,539 --> 01:06:48,873
Tragic mass murder, sir

1094
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:03,426
They had burnt the trash here

1095
01:07:03,451 --> 01:07:04,992
Smoke emanated from here

1096
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,433
They've dumped
electronic items here, sir

1097
01:07:34,602 --> 01:07:37,102
Looks like hospital wastage, sir

1098
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:39,101
Sir, I'm calling from
Uppada dump yard

1099
01:07:39,182 --> 01:07:41,474
Trash consists of
medicine from Australia

1100
01:07:41,586 --> 01:07:43,503
Waterbody has been contaminated

1101
01:07:44,592 --> 01:07:45,925
All Australian covers, sir

1102
01:07:47,028 --> 01:07:48,217
They contain human organs

1103
01:07:48,285 --> 01:07:50,826
Each and every cover has
'Australia' labeled on it

1104
01:07:59,705 --> 01:08:02,160
Get me all the details
about that CBI officer

1105
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,669
Reddy's motive for
killing the commissioner

1106
01:08:21,128 --> 01:08:22,912
Medical waste from Australia...

1107
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:25,133
...and e-waste from
their computer companies

1108
01:08:25,228 --> 01:08:27,292
...are getting dumped into
our country's dump yard

1109
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:31,494
This dealing is through Rajeev Krishna
who imports it as 'Vizag Scrap'

1110
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:35,252
Toxic smoke as a result
of burning this trash...

1111
01:08:35,429 --> 01:08:36,977
......has taken the lives of 32 children

1112
01:08:37,222 --> 01:08:39,792
They are selling tablets from here
well past the expiry date locally

1113
01:08:39,845 --> 01:08:41,112
Deducing this, the commissioner...

1114
01:08:41,227 --> 01:08:42,411
'...has warned Reddy'

1115
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:44,450
Since he didn't comply...

1116
01:08:44,475 --> 01:08:46,642
...commissioner has called
for a Press meet

1117
01:08:46,836 --> 01:08:49,191
'Hearing this news also
through Mr Krishnaraj...'

1118
01:08:49,282 --> 01:08:52,658
'...they lured him to a venue and
tried to strike a deal with him'

1119
01:08:52,683 --> 01:08:54,389
'Since the commissioner didn't agree...'

1120
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:56,418
'...they have shot him ruthlessly'

1121
01:08:59,482 --> 01:09:00,899
More than Reddy, we know

1122
01:09:01,026 --> 01:09:02,902
...there's a stronger power

1123
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:04,503
...in Australia!

1124
01:09:07,686 --> 01:09:09,503
The entire department is angry

1125
01:09:09,631 --> 01:09:10,729
Where's the teacher staying?

1126
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,362
In the headmaster's house

1127
01:09:12,486 --> 01:09:13,883
Get an arrest warrant
in the morning

1128
01:09:13,935 --> 01:09:15,727
Follow him
night and day

1129
01:09:16,115 --> 01:09:17,390
I'll go to the harbor tonight

1130
01:09:17,461 --> 01:09:19,627
And open un-dispatched
containers and get the proof

1131
01:09:19,652 --> 01:09:21,110
Will be around 60 to 70 containers

1132
01:09:21,135 --> 01:09:22,635
How many belong to Reddy?

1133
01:09:22,732 --> 01:09:24,857
- Maybe 40
- I'll be there in another hour

1134
01:09:25,377 --> 01:09:27,974
- Tell me, Reddy
- Close that teacher's chapter

1135
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:29,749
I'll finish him off and call you

1136
01:09:34,878 --> 01:09:35,961
Tell me

1137
01:09:38,476 --> 01:09:41,173
Duraisingam has entered the harbor
Finish him off right there

1138
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:43,801
Boys are tanked
How can they do it now?

1139
01:09:44,076 --> 01:09:46,461
If he checks the containers,
I won't be able to answer Vittal

1140
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:47,569
Okay, I'll go myself

1141
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:51,397
One of our men
is on night duty there

1142
01:09:51,543 --> 01:09:53,291
Get the boat
Go to the harbor

1143
01:09:53,316 --> 01:09:54,314
26281

1144
01:09:54,445 --> 01:09:56,487
This cargo is from
Sydney Iron Scraps

1145
01:09:56,628 --> 01:09:57,878
Speed up

1146
01:09:58,056 --> 01:09:59,390
Yeah, we can open this

1147
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,961
What's all this, sir?

1148
01:10:11,884 --> 01:10:13,342
It's all medi-waste

1149
01:10:17,698 --> 01:10:19,342
Until I get the arrest warrant tomorrow...

1150
01:10:19,367 --> 01:10:21,618
...none of these containers
should leave this place

1151
01:10:27,101 --> 01:10:28,893
Don't let them off the hook

1152
01:10:47,989 --> 01:10:49,197
Sir, over there

1153
01:11:27,178 --> 01:11:29,387
- Where is the teacher?
- Run...run, sir

1154
01:11:29,713 --> 01:11:31,170
Chop him

1155
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,371
Hey! Teacher

1156
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:11,458
- Where are you?
- Hey! Kill him

1157
01:12:17,997 --> 01:12:20,076
Drive fast
Come to Netaji nagar

1158
01:12:33,881 --> 01:12:35,506
That's the police...run

1159
01:12:53,588 --> 01:12:54,755
You bloody sinners!

1160
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,587
- Tell me
- I killed the teacher

1161
01:12:56,788 --> 01:12:58,079
Stay on the line

1162
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:00,579
That teacher is dead

1163
01:13:01,693 --> 01:13:03,026
Please be on the line

1164
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:17,615
Hey, deputy commissioner

1165
01:13:17,808 --> 01:13:20,362
Haven't you witnessed
death in your service?

1166
01:13:20,483 --> 01:13:22,191
You are going overboard on this one

1167
01:13:23,414 --> 01:13:25,103
You've hidden your
entire background

1168
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:27,098
So working as
a happy-go-lucky cop?

1169
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:28,604
Who the hell are you?

1170
01:13:32,323 --> 01:13:35,054
Your dad is Soundara Pandi
Mom is Kalyani

1171
01:13:35,089 --> 01:13:36,028
Sister is Dhanalakshmi

1172
01:13:36,053 --> 01:13:38,022
Her kids are studying
in Infant Jesus school

1173
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:39,815
Including the fact
you divorced your wife...

1174
01:13:39,903 --> 01:13:41,029
I know everything

1175
01:13:41,616 --> 01:13:43,175
Your dad owns
a grocery store in Tuticorin

1176
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,824
You own a house
in Nallur village

1177
01:13:45,033 --> 01:13:50,409
I've marked your house at 8.585645
latitude and 78.056442 longitude

1178
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:56,678
Paying 1billion, on international borders
if I send a missile from a ship...

1179
01:13:57,512 --> 01:13:59,012
...not only your house

1180
01:13:59,157 --> 01:14:01,282
The entire town will
be razed to the ground

1181
01:14:01,508 --> 01:14:03,446
If you're appointed to
investigate a murder case

1182
01:14:03,502 --> 01:14:04,835
...do just that!

1183
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:07,883
Why do you rake up
all the trash unnecessarily?

1184
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:11,329
If you dig this dump...

1185
01:14:11,491 --> 01:14:13,074
...I'll dig the grave
for your family

1186
01:14:40,523 --> 01:14:41,939
He was a good man

1187
01:14:42,386 --> 01:14:43,991
He was under our care

1188
01:14:44,016 --> 01:14:45,331
Couldn't save him!

1189
01:14:45,429 --> 01:14:47,179
Ravi is the one
who has killed him

1190
01:14:48,112 --> 01:14:50,571
We traced the call you
received from Australia

1191
01:14:50,596 --> 01:14:52,952
Because it was an internet call,
we couldn't trace the number

1192
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:54,754
We must first arrest Ravi

1193
01:14:55,058 --> 01:14:56,891
If he opens his mouth...

1194
01:14:56,987 --> 01:14:58,362
...we'll arrest Reddy

1195
01:14:58,799 --> 01:15:01,591
Reddy, Duraisingam won't interfere
 in our business hereafter

1196
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:02,586
What do you mean, sir?

1197
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:06,139
You were on the con call
when I spoke to him

1198
01:15:07,146 --> 01:15:08,271
He was shaken up

1199
01:15:14,663 --> 01:15:16,618
Duraisingam has entered your area

1200
01:15:16,654 --> 01:15:18,695
Not even a single police
will go back alive!

1201
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:19,730
I'll finish all of them

1202
01:15:19,755 --> 01:15:21,588
Please get me
out on bail, Reddy

1203
01:15:23,334 --> 01:15:24,751
Hey! Get the gun

1204
01:15:35,553 --> 01:15:37,011
Don't let them go

1205
01:15:44,205 --> 01:15:45,914
Surround the building

1206
01:15:55,579 --> 01:15:56,703
Start the car

1207
01:15:58,321 --> 01:15:59,821
Drive through the bazaar road

1208
01:16:02,648 --> 01:16:03,557
Straight

1209
01:16:03,582 --> 01:16:04,914
They are following us

1210
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:06,538
Knock all the cars
on the road

1211
01:16:06,824 --> 01:16:07,451
Speed up...quick

1212
01:16:12,271 --> 01:16:13,438
No one got hurt, right?

1213
01:16:19,269 --> 01:16:20,560
Smash that damn car

1214
01:16:30,214 --> 01:16:31,995
He's disrupting the traffic
driving like a maniac

1215
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,955
Drive towards him in DG road
and divert him to Ring road

1216
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:36,378
Don't give him way

1217
01:16:36,469 --> 01:16:38,386
Speed up
Block him

1218
01:16:38,591 --> 01:16:39,965
Turn left

1219
01:16:41,565 --> 01:16:42,436
Don't miss

1220
01:16:42,461 --> 01:16:44,127
Don't allow him, overtake

1221
01:16:44,606 --> 01:16:46,148
Speed up
Faster

1222
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:51,833
"Faster than a whirlwind
He is here to spin a win"

1223
01:16:52,178 --> 01:16:56,265
"A lion gathering momentum
He is Duraisingam"

1224
01:16:56,290 --> 01:16:57,956
"Springs lithesome"

1225
01:17:00,355 --> 01:17:02,229
"Eyes blazing fury"

1226
01:17:04,335 --> 01:17:06,543
"Just its snarl is scary"

1227
01:17:19,991 --> 01:17:21,533
Don't shoot me

1228
01:17:21,558 --> 01:17:23,141
I'll surrender, sir

1229
01:17:34,604 --> 01:17:36,062
What do you want, sir?

1230
01:17:45,316 --> 01:17:47,528
You backstabbed me, right?

1231
01:17:47,749 --> 01:17:49,719
If a policeman dodges,
it means he's lurking!

1232
01:17:49,842 --> 01:17:51,842
If he lurks, it means
he intends to strike

1233
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:56,042
The dog has identified
a spot near the well

1234
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:00,603
Didn't I tell you
the day we meet...

1235
01:18:00,645 --> 01:18:03,391
...I can assure you will be
a memorable day in your life!

1236
01:18:03,436 --> 01:18:06,769
I'll neither forget nor forgive!

1237
01:18:06,887 --> 01:18:08,346
Found the gun, sir

1238
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:11,603
You've used this gun to kill
the commissioner a year ago

1239
01:18:11,628 --> 01:18:15,690
And 2 months ago
2 securities who worked for you

1240
01:18:15,972 --> 01:18:19,305
You made 'Gun' Ravi kill
our witness, Govt school teacher

1241
01:18:19,483 --> 01:18:21,124
Ravi has turned approver

1242
01:18:21,149 --> 01:18:23,357
Here, Central Minister
is on the phone

1243
01:18:32,189 --> 01:18:33,393
Shut up and
get into the vehicle

1244
01:18:33,538 --> 01:18:35,788
Otherwise I'll bury you alive

1245
01:18:44,184 --> 01:18:44,915
Stop...!

1246
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:48,662
I heard you won't step
into the police station!

1247
01:18:49,329 --> 01:18:51,288
Take off your slippers and come in

1248
01:18:52,268 --> 01:18:54,726
Will you or should
I do the honors?

1249
01:19:05,164 --> 01:19:08,698
'In commissioner Ramakrishna's
murder case as a crucial turning point...'

1250
01:19:08,723 --> 01:19:10,627
'...renowned businessman
Madhusudhana Reddy'

1251
01:19:10,783 --> 01:19:11,897
'...was arrested today'

1252
01:19:12,022 --> 01:19:14,169
'He will be produced
in court tomorrow'

1253
01:19:14,194 --> 01:19:17,273
For the planned murder of
Police commissioner Ramakrishna...

1254
01:19:17,298 --> 01:19:19,506
...this court orders
R. Madhusudhana Reddy

1255
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:22,670
...to be remanded to
 judicial custody for 15 days

1256
01:19:25,235 --> 01:19:26,928
Sir, which jail is Reddy in now?

1257
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:30,814
Will you go back
to Tamil Nadu, sir?

1258
01:19:30,839 --> 01:19:33,464
I'm here till the charge sheet
of this case is filed

1259
01:19:33,592 --> 01:19:37,758
What's your comment on your 'bond' with
Reddy as reported in a weekly magazine?

1260
01:19:37,808 --> 01:19:40,600
Don't question me on what's reported
without getting the facts right

1261
01:19:40,724 --> 01:19:43,932
People will think twice before believing
what politicians or officers say

1262
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:45,950
But anything published
in the Press...

1263
01:19:45,975 --> 01:19:47,309
...they'll believe it first

1264
01:19:47,334 --> 01:19:48,610
Only then they will think!

1265
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:50,219
Their trust in you is so strong

1266
01:19:52,275 --> 01:19:53,807
Hey! He's looking at everyone

1267
01:19:54,114 --> 01:19:55,868
But he isn't making
eye contact with you

1268
01:19:55,956 --> 01:19:57,956
If he looks at me
without looking at anyone...

1269
01:19:58,104 --> 01:19:58,993
...then I'm special

1270
01:19:59,036 --> 01:20:01,161
But if he looks at
everyone and not me...

1271
01:20:01,227 --> 01:20:02,269
...I'm extra special!

1272
01:20:27,478 --> 01:20:31,307
âWi wi wi wifi

âGirl in love
O'crazy girl in love!â

1282
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:12,497
âAm I also a love-jockey?â

01:21:14,758 --> 01:21:16,716
âAre you also crazy?â

1284
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:20,971
âAre you also hot coffee?â

1285
01:21:20,996 --> 01:21:24,246
âWill you come, girl?
Is it okay if you will?â

1286
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:29,450
âWi wi wi wifi

01:22:02,871 --> 01:22:05,930
âIâll feel dizzy insideâ

1292
01:22:06,911 --> 01:22:10,953
âWalking in the morning
Chatting in the eveningâ

1293
01:22:11,154 --> 01:22:14,196
âLife will be a paradise of datingâ

1294
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:19,247
âWill you take me to Phuket island, love?â

1295
01:22:19,429 --> 01:22:23,345
âWill you kiss me on the boatâs bow?â

1296
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:26,654
âIâll lose my senses senselesslyâ

1297
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:30,782
âFloat in thoughts of you fullyâ

1298
01:22:31,643 --> 01:22:35,420

1305
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:37,259
âWhy would I be scared then
to touch you, oâ maiden?â

1306
01:23:37,711 --> 01:23:41,711
âYou zeroed in on my anger
You zoomed in my vigorâ

1307
01:23:42,162 --> 01:23:46,121
âYou planned to rob me

1308
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:49,573
âI would have known myself anewâ

1309
01:23:50,189 --> 01:23:53,800
âI would have melted before youâ

âFall in love
Youâd better fall in love!â

1314
01:24:30,745 --> 01:24:31,543
This is for your perusal, sir

1315
01:24:31,683 --> 01:24:33,433
Commissioner's murder case file

1316
01:24:33,722 --> 01:24:35,431
The motive for this murder

1317
01:24:42,862 --> 01:24:44,651
You didn't disclose
any of this in the court!

1318
01:24:44,798 --> 01:24:46,424
Deliberate ploy on my part, sir

1319
01:24:46,596 --> 01:24:50,262
This file was prepared for
the court, CBI and Govt, sir

1320
01:24:51,261 --> 01:24:53,303
I've created another file
for personal use

1321
01:24:54,062 --> 01:24:55,149
Because...

1322
01:24:55,272 --> 01:24:57,397
...the chap who spoke
to me from Australia

1323
01:24:58,275 --> 01:25:00,608
...my hometown,
about my family

1324
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,997
He spoke volumes, sir

1325
01:25:04,133 --> 01:25:06,419
I'll deal with this case
from Tamil Nadu, sir

1326
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:08,322
Why canât you work from here?

1327
01:25:09,357 --> 01:25:10,371
No, sir

1328
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:12,621
This isn't a State's problem alone

1329
01:25:12,859 --> 01:25:13,936
Our country's problem!

1330
01:25:14,139 --> 01:25:15,431
To deal with this

1331
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:22,020
Won't we support you?

1332
01:25:22,112 --> 01:25:23,612
I must be a bit crude

1333
01:25:24,025 --> 01:25:25,733
And bend a few rules

1334
01:25:26,046 --> 01:25:27,879
You must turn a blind eye to that

1335
01:25:27,904 --> 01:25:29,654
My State has to earn a good name

1336
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:30,881
It should be glorified

1337
01:25:30,997 --> 01:25:32,872
I'll do anything to achieve that

1338
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:36,166
I must fly to Australia at once

1339
01:25:36,209 --> 01:25:39,666
I'll get a confidential report of which
company is exporting containers from there

1340
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:40,910
Only then take action

1341
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,461
I'll talk to the Embassy right away

1342
01:25:42,506 --> 01:25:44,756
Let this be just
between you and me, sir

1343
01:25:44,942 --> 01:25:46,662
I'm making it out
to be a personal trip

1344
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:48,039
In case those activities...

1345
01:25:48,236 --> 01:25:50,706
...are happening with the Australian
Govt. officials in the loop

1346
01:25:50,756 --> 01:25:52,839
...then we won't get
an iota of help from them

1347
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,978
I want to see him

1348
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,930
The chap who spoke
over the phone with me

1349
01:26:00,831 --> 01:26:02,206
Meet him
face to face

1350
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:08,900
Vittal, you're careless

1351
01:26:10,546 --> 01:26:12,380
In the FIR copy
submitted to the court...

1352
01:26:12,472 --> 01:26:15,180
...about medi-waste,
e-waste, or dump yard

1353
01:26:15,329 --> 01:26:16,598
Or about the school kids

1354
01:26:16,706 --> 01:26:18,456
...that policeman
didn't emphasize

1355
01:26:18,542 --> 01:26:19,259
So...?

1356
01:26:21,263 --> 01:26:23,272
We can get Reddy out in 2 appeals

1357
01:26:23,343 --> 01:26:26,051
In another 10 days that DC
will wait outside our office

1358
01:26:27,822 --> 01:26:31,010
Because we cleared the medi-waste
 and e-waste in Australia...

1359
01:26:31,086 --> 01:26:34,544
...the Govt. is giving us the iron scrap,
lock, stock and barrel for free almost

1360
01:26:38,969 --> 01:26:41,895
Hi tigress sweetie! Is anyone
 known to us in Australia?

1361
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:46,031
Our company's Australian dealer
Pushparaj anna is in Sydney

1362
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:47,792
Iâve got a week off

1363
01:26:47,959 --> 01:26:50,138
So wondering if we can
go for a 2nd honeymoon!

1364
01:26:54,055 --> 01:26:56,577
- Hi, Kavya
- I'm flying to Australia next week

1365
01:26:59,033 --> 01:27:00,512
Who are you going with?

1366
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:01,560
Moron of a mom!

1367
01:27:02,406 --> 01:27:04,114
Whom will I go with
for a honeymoon?

1368
01:27:05,104 --> 01:27:07,481
Book your flight
on a Full moon day

1369
01:27:07,546 --> 01:27:09,469
Only then the moon
will shine real bright

1370
01:27:09,494 --> 01:27:11,535
Mummy, why are you
 still a dummy?

1371
01:27:11,696 --> 01:27:14,751
My dear child, your husband will claim
he's taking you on a honeymoon...

1372
01:27:14,805 --> 01:27:16,972
...he will go just to
arrest someone there

1373
01:27:17,055 --> 01:27:18,721
My mental mother
hang up now

1374
01:27:24,814 --> 01:27:26,782
- Sister, how are you?
- I'm fine

1375
01:27:26,807 --> 01:27:28,266
Mr Singam, how are you?

1376
01:27:32,505 --> 01:27:34,213
I've heard of a 2nd attempt in exams

1377
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:35,654
And 2nd innings in cricket

1378
01:27:35,799 --> 01:27:37,882
1st time I'm hearing
of a 2nd honeymoon!

1379
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,694
Shameless! Why are you
harping on this?

1380
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:41,342
How could you
call me 'shameless'?

1381
01:27:41,432 --> 01:27:43,349
- My heart missed a beat
- Not you, bro

1382
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:44,784
He was talking to the driver

1383
01:27:44,942 --> 01:27:46,401
Shameless fellow!
Drive properly

1384
01:27:53,939 --> 01:27:55,329
âLovey dovey smack upâ

1385
01:27:55,845 --> 01:27:57,346
âBiggy-wiggy match upâ

1386
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,607
Pushparaj, rent a car for me

1387
01:27:59,661 --> 01:28:01,287
"Ema gama gama got up"

1388
01:28:03,866 --> 01:28:05,782
'Roaring lion'

1389
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:09,170
'Daring lion'

1390
01:28:11,591 --> 01:28:13,007
'Soaring lion'

1391
01:28:15,285 --> 01:28:16,611
'Rocking lion'

1392
01:28:16,714 --> 01:28:18,131
âWanna wanna wanna higherâ

1393
01:28:18,687 --> 01:28:20,378
"Gonna gonna gonna fire"

1394
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,381
"Gotta gotta gotta near"

1395
01:28:22,489 --> 01:28:24,197
"Never never never fear"

1396
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:28,239
'Sydney Mission'

1397
01:28:30,559 --> 01:28:32,184
'Own decision'

1398
01:28:34,383 --> 01:28:36,466
"Has the vision"

1399
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:39,806
'For the nation'

1400
01:28:54,808 --> 01:28:56,524
"He crossed the high seas"

1401
01:28:56,702 --> 01:28:58,411
"He whizzed like the breeze"

1402
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:00,221
"Stood his ground
Every nano second"

1403
01:29:00,334 --> 01:29:02,250
"Confirmed win

1404
01:29:06,283 --> 01:29:07,902

"King of the jungle rocking lion"

01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:15,176
"Dare to defy
this roaring lion"

1409
01:29:15,201 --> 01:29:17,643
You're flying a camera
on a helicopter?

1410
01:29:17,996 --> 01:29:20,467
Shouldn't we know
what's on the other side?

1411
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:28,606
They may spot us
Let's get out of here

1412
01:29:28,658 --> 01:29:30,475
Wait, let the right person show up

1413
01:29:33,209 --> 01:29:34,917
- Yes, Veeram?
- Sir, where are you?

1414
01:29:34,966 --> 01:29:35,735
I'm in Tuticorin

1415
01:29:35,776 --> 01:29:37,688
I called home and
they said you haven't come

1416
01:29:37,713 --> 01:29:39,189
- Talk to one of our townsfolk
- Give it to him

1417
01:29:39,389 --> 01:29:41,138
- What, bro?
- Hi hobo

1418
01:29:41,737 --> 01:29:44,012
- Why don't you believe 'sir'?
- I won't you know

1419
01:29:44,088 --> 01:29:46,019
If you keep saying this
 I'll break your teeth

1420
01:29:46,044 --> 01:29:47,540
I'll rip your ears to pieces

1421
01:29:47,565 --> 01:29:49,082
I'll spray Tuticorin salt on your face

1422
01:29:49,107 --> 01:29:51,023
I'll stuff Kovilpatti mud
into your mouth

1423
01:29:51,228 --> 01:29:52,811
He stoops even lower than me

1424
01:29:52,982 --> 01:29:54,765
- Sir is in Tuticorin
- How are you so sure?

1425
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:56,681
Heâs drawling
Tuticorin slang to the T

1426
01:29:56,739 --> 01:29:59,240
"Re-re-re reloading re-re-reloading"

1427
01:29:59,265 --> 01:30:01,142

bullet on a zoom"

1428
01:30:01,167 --> 01:30:02,917

1429
01:30:03,121 --> 01:30:04,966
"Got it all locked down
None to question"

1430
01:30:04,991 --> 01:30:06,866
"Didgeridoo, if you know who"

1431
01:30:06,891 --> 01:30:08,799
"He could do it solo
what takes two"

1432
01:30:08,824 --> 01:30:10,563
"Gonna leave a trail in New South Wales"

1433
01:30:10,588 --> 01:30:12,380
"Kangaroo kick!
This manâs so fleek!"

1434
01:30:22,057 --> 01:30:24,000
- What is this building?
- Vittal Steel office, sir

1435
01:30:24,065 --> 01:30:25,856
Our Central Minister Ram Prasad's son

1436
01:30:26,091 --> 01:30:27,841
Why take it into this office?

1437
01:30:29,592 --> 01:30:32,836
Check if there's any Australian number
in the phone we seized from Reddy

1438
01:30:32,905 --> 01:30:34,364
Will call back
in 10 minutes, sir

1439
01:30:36,542 --> 01:30:40,624
There is just 1 Australian number under
the name Vittal in the sim we processed

1440
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:42,392
They've been in touch
once in 2 days, sir

1441
01:30:42,489 --> 01:30:43,530
Give me that number

1442
01:30:49,982 --> 01:30:52,113
'If you dig this dump...'

1443
01:30:52,138 --> 01:30:53,971
' ...I'll dig the grave
for your family'

1444
01:30:54,288 --> 01:30:56,205
The same voice that spoke to me

1445
01:30:57,267 --> 01:30:59,476
Vittal is the mastermind
behind this whole scam

1446
01:30:59,942 --> 01:31:01,234
Take Murali into custody

1447
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,084
Ask him to wait for
my call in Control room

1448
01:31:03,854 --> 01:31:05,814
My flight is at
6:00 p.m tomorrow

1449
01:31:05,879 --> 01:31:08,277
Can you fix an appointment
with Vittal by 11:00 a.m?

1450
01:31:08,302 --> 01:31:09,885
I'll get someone
in 2 minutes

1451
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:12,491
Pushparaj'na

1452
01:31:12,596 --> 01:31:14,305
How did you marry her?

1453
01:31:14,424 --> 01:31:16,007
How else but by tricking her!

1454
01:31:21,223 --> 01:31:23,972
Some chap promised to get me a job
in Australia and ditched me

1455
01:31:24,073 --> 01:31:26,323
To work here, I needed a Green card

1456
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:28,626
To get the Green card, I had to
marry a white card like this

1457
01:31:28,781 --> 01:31:30,531
I'm a big black card myself!

1458
01:31:30,556 --> 01:31:31,973
At that time

1459
01:31:32,006 --> 01:31:33,750
'I will marry only a dark fellow'

1460
01:31:33,793 --> 01:31:37,693
So said my darling and made
a royal exit from the country

1461
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:43,602
"With his coal black hands he hugged me"

1462
01:31:44,105 --> 01:31:47,154
"My love blossomed ever so tenderly"

1463
01:31:47,233 --> 01:31:48,375
The moment I married her...

1464
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,065
...through your father
I became a dealer of India Cycles

1465
01:31:51,142 --> 01:31:52,977
Thanks to sir, I've even
become a policeman!

1466
01:31:53,002 --> 01:31:54,543
- Hey!
- What...?

1467
01:31:54,693 --> 01:31:56,805
You didn't tell your wife
about your investigation?

1468
01:31:56,993 --> 01:31:59,202
Please tell her, sir
Cough up the truth

1469
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:02,335
Don't lie to your wife
You'll regret it later

1470
01:32:02,498 --> 01:32:03,223
Blabbermouth!

1471
01:32:03,256 --> 01:32:05,131
My mom warned me
when I was packing

1472
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:09,348
How is your holiday?

1473
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:12,130
Your son-in-law is doing
his 'look for the crook' here too!

1474
01:32:12,281 --> 01:32:13,489
Didn't I tell you?

1475
01:32:13,514 --> 01:32:15,056
My dad is a textile store

1476
01:32:15,143 --> 01:32:16,768
Your dad is a cycle store

1477
01:32:16,793 --> 01:32:18,877
Your husband's dad
is a grocery store

1478
01:32:18,934 --> 01:32:20,559
Your husband is a police booth!

1479
01:32:20,654 --> 01:32:22,335
They don't even know
the spelling of 'jolly'!

1480
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:23,544
They'll only be job-aholics!

1481
01:32:23,873 --> 01:32:24,873
Hear me out

1482
01:32:25,531 --> 01:32:28,365
If I had told you earlier, would you
have enjoyed these 4 days?

1483
01:32:28,526 --> 01:32:29,913
You would have been so stressed

1484
01:32:30,105 --> 01:32:31,237
As far as we are concerned

1485
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,041
...it should be a 100% holiday

1486
01:32:33,163 --> 01:32:34,658
That's why I didn't
inform you earlier

1487
01:32:34,859 --> 01:32:37,317
Now spare me for just 1/2 hour
for an appointment

1488
01:32:37,342 --> 01:32:38,342
I'll be right back

1489
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:39,313
Quick as a wink!

1490
01:32:39,784 --> 01:32:42,576
- Where are you going?
- Investigation going on

1491
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:58,028
Murali, I am in Vittal's office

1492
01:32:58,221 --> 01:32:59,237
I'm connected to their wifi

1493
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:05,187
We must get the access point
Enter the number I give you, sir

1494
01:33:39,325 --> 01:33:42,430
"The lion stalks its prey stealthily
Duraisingam on a hunting spree"

1495
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,379
"Pounces powerfully"

1496
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:49,253
"The lion in the enemy's den
Duraisingam the unbeaten"

1497
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:51,027
"Prowls for a reason"

1498
01:34:05,126 --> 01:34:07,835
- Then...deputy commissioner?
- That's my profession

1499
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:19,570
I came here for 2 reasons

1500
01:34:21,627 --> 01:34:24,168
If you supply 8000 tons
annually to my company ...

1501
01:34:24,268 --> 01:34:25,621
...it will be useful
for my production

1502
01:34:27,007 --> 01:34:28,840
One random scumbag...

1503
01:34:29,487 --> 01:34:31,403
...called me from Australia

1504
01:34:32,372 --> 01:34:34,712
He threatened to
wipe out my family

1505
01:34:34,737 --> 01:34:39,069
He can't even pluck a blade
of grass from Nallur, my hometown

1506
01:34:39,612 --> 01:34:41,695
I came to pass on
this message directly

1507
01:34:44,531 --> 01:34:46,974
Whether I clinch that deal
of 8000 ton scrap or not...

1508
01:34:46,999 --> 01:34:48,875
...that 80 kilo lazy buffalo

1509
01:34:49,737 --> 01:34:51,904
...will definitely fall
into the palm of my hand

1510
01:35:02,695 --> 01:35:04,449
He has taken off
and gone to his hometown

1511
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:05,541
I am watching him

1512
01:35:10,243 --> 01:35:10,707
What happened?

1513
01:35:27,997 --> 01:35:29,042
Why did you leave?

1514
01:35:29,067 --> 01:35:30,459
Boss wanted to meet you

1515
01:35:30,653 --> 01:35:32,278
Let me talk to your boss

1516
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,290
I know you are
that 80 kilo buffalo

1517
01:35:36,411 --> 01:35:40,786
To target you I've crossed the boundaries
of my hometown, country and continent

1518
01:35:44,051 --> 01:35:45,259
Indian police, I say

1519
01:35:49,013 --> 01:35:49,987
- Kavya
 - What happened?

1520
01:35:50,012 --> 01:35:51,137
Our flight is only at 6 p.m

1521
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:53,293
Stay in the airport
Don't stay in the city till then

1522
01:35:56,431 --> 01:35:57,545
He thinks I've come alone

1523
01:35:57,644 --> 01:35:58,400
Let him assume so

1524
01:36:00,781 --> 01:36:02,537
Use Indian number
Trash the local sim cards

1525
01:36:04,659 --> 01:36:05,445
Don't come with me

1526
01:36:05,614 --> 01:36:07,307
I'll leave the car in the airport
Settle the bill

1527
01:38:07,503 --> 01:38:09,799
His name is Duraisingam
And that's ME!

1528
01:38:16,166 --> 01:38:18,916
"Duraisingam; force to reckon with"

1529
01:38:18,945 --> 01:38:20,653
"Pounces pits to zenith"

1530
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:32,792
"Duraiingam; a lion with guts and grit"

1531
01:38:46,098 --> 01:38:49,248
If you land ahead of him
he'll think you've got the jitters

1532
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:04,040
Stop right there

1533
01:39:04,182 --> 01:39:05,278
Why did you come here?

1534
01:39:05,278 --> 01:39:06,732
I haven't seen your sir
for a week

1535
01:39:06,757 --> 01:39:08,582
We have strict orders
not to let you in

1536
01:39:08,638 --> 01:39:09,837
Lift her scooty

1537
01:39:09,862 --> 01:39:11,612
- Lift...throw
- Where are you taking it?

1538
01:39:11,637 --> 01:39:13,845
Don't throw her
Trying your tricks with me!

1539
01:39:15,565 --> 01:39:16,313
Just you wait!

1540
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:18,143
I'll hook your boss

1541
01:39:18,295 --> 01:39:19,336
I'll marry him

1542
01:39:19,475 --> 01:39:20,612
I'll come here as his wife

1543
01:39:20,673 --> 01:39:22,757
Then watch how I torture you

1544
01:39:25,546 --> 01:39:27,462
- My deaaaaaar!
- What happened?

1545
01:39:27,571 --> 01:39:30,320
He has fractured
the crab's legs, dear

1546
01:39:30,368 --> 01:39:31,660
Fracture, huh?

1547
01:39:31,854 --> 01:39:33,961
Oooh! Aaah! Ouch!!

1548
01:39:34,088 --> 01:39:37,320
- Glutton! Won't the crab be hurt?
- Did you buy it as a pet?

1549
01:39:37,378 --> 01:39:38,332
Not just 1 day

1550
01:39:38,444 --> 01:39:40,152
I'll torture you
every single day

1551
01:39:40,597 --> 01:39:42,217
The loo needs to be cleaned

1552
01:39:42,242 --> 01:39:43,908
Leave someone behind

1553
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:45,404
I'll leave Veeram behind

1554
01:39:45,762 --> 01:39:47,407
Wonder why I was named
'Veeram' meaning bravery

1555
01:39:47,566 --> 01:39:50,532
- My 'Veeram' has gone for a toss
- He's saying it as pun intended

1556
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,597
Kill him via 'encounter'

1557
01:39:51,622 --> 01:39:52,707
Encounter, huh?

1558
01:39:52,732 --> 01:39:53,856
Pun intended, huh?!

1559
01:39:56,695 --> 01:39:58,023
Don't forget
I belong to the Press

1560
01:39:58,071 --> 01:39:59,434
Not Press
Pressure cooker

1561
01:39:59,483 --> 01:40:01,510
- How many whistles!
- You dare raise your voice

1562
01:40:01,541 --> 01:40:02,782
I'll crush your Adam's apple

1563
01:40:02,978 --> 01:40:04,211
Men get it often

1564
01:40:04,392 --> 01:40:05,820
- Women sometimes
- What?

1565
01:40:05,862 --> 01:40:07,114
- Anger
- Oh! That, huh?

1566
01:40:07,139 --> 01:40:08,578
I'll finish you off
through Facebook

1567
01:40:08,626 --> 01:40:09,836
I'll twist you via Twitter

1568
01:40:10,062 --> 01:40:11,608
I'll wipe you out
in WhatsApp

1569
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:13,314
Are all these your thugs?

1570
01:40:13,475 --> 01:40:15,769
- She's acting like Google Pichai's sister
- Who is that?

1571
01:40:15,933 --> 01:40:18,372
I'll grow old explaining to you
First put her behind bars

1572
01:40:18,403 --> 01:40:19,403
She's a jailbird!

1573
01:40:19,428 --> 01:40:20,913
She'll come out on bail
through Email!

1574
01:40:21,036 --> 01:40:22,412
Look how I tame her!

1575
01:40:22,837 --> 01:40:24,116
Hereafter I am
your slave forever

1576
01:40:24,141 --> 01:40:25,600
I'll listen to whatever you say

1577
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:30,716
- Yes, Subbu
- Reddy is out on bail

1578
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:38,458
- They humiliated us, sir
- What happened?

1579
01:40:38,521 --> 01:40:40,978
8 lawyers came from Delhi
to take Reddy out on bail, sir

1580
01:40:41,102 --> 01:40:41,978
How did he get the bail?

1581
01:40:42,046 --> 01:40:44,564
3 of them surrendered claiming
they killed the commissioner

1582
01:40:44,607 --> 01:40:47,982
2 of them were criminals who had
escaped from Vijayawada police encounter

1583
01:40:48,130 --> 01:40:50,963
What I couldn't digest was
the reason they gave, sir

1584
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:54,429
He claimed the commissioner
constantly tortured his wife sexually

1585
01:40:54,491 --> 01:40:58,324
To escape that, they joined hands
and killed him is his story, sir

1586
01:40:59,753 --> 01:41:00,740
They ruined his name

1587
01:41:00,784 --> 01:41:03,241
CBI lawyer didn't utter
a single word, sir

1588
01:41:03,615 --> 01:41:05,153
This is all Reddy's doing, sir

1589
01:41:05,215 --> 01:41:06,590
This is Vittal's game plan

1590
01:41:07,172 --> 01:41:09,136
He has started showing his power

1591
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:17,609
I'm sure you witnessed it?

1592
01:41:17,689 --> 01:41:19,772
You had a glimpse of my power?

1593
01:41:20,195 --> 01:41:21,322
You heard?

1594
01:41:21,363 --> 01:41:24,029
You heard about
the court proceedings?

1595
01:41:24,627 --> 01:41:26,503
I was loaded
with power and position

1596
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:29,040
You saw to it I was positioned
in a room without power!

1597
01:41:29,521 --> 01:41:33,062
I'll take away your power and pull
by this evening, just you wait

1598
01:41:33,403 --> 01:41:36,945
By tomorrow evening
I'll close your chapter

1599
01:41:44,737 --> 01:41:46,778
Sir, CBI is on the line

1600
01:41:46,986 --> 01:41:48,654
They want to see you immediately

1601
01:41:50,786 --> 01:41:53,327
Did you pay heed to me
when I cautioned you repeatedly?

1602
01:41:53,653 --> 01:41:55,369
The dead won't come alive

1603
01:41:55,394 --> 01:41:57,693
At least let the others
carry on with their lives

1604
01:41:57,863 --> 01:41:59,613
Now haven't you
made it even worse?

1605
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,695
You've showed a person
who is very diligent...

1606
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,803
...can't even have
 a dignified death?!

1607
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:10,820
My 2 daughters are back home
from school totally humiliated

1608
01:42:11,204 --> 01:42:13,038
Now all our neighbors...

1609
01:42:13,681 --> 01:42:15,848
...look at us scornfully

1610
01:42:16,945 --> 01:42:20,028
Shall I drown in the sea
along with my daughters?

1611
01:42:21,031 --> 01:42:22,240
Why should we die?

1612
01:42:23,203 --> 01:42:26,912
With whatever grit and guts
 you arrested that Reddy...

1613
01:42:27,393 --> 01:42:29,576
...with the same bravery and bravado

1614
01:42:29,601 --> 01:42:33,904
...close his chapter and prove
my husband's integrity and diligence

1615
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:36,533
Otherwise-

1616
01:42:43,561 --> 01:42:44,753
Tell me

1617
01:42:44,778 --> 01:42:46,278
Why did you arrest Reddy?

1618
01:42:46,348 --> 01:42:48,111
He has asked Reddy for some bribe

1619
01:42:48,236 --> 01:42:51,945
When he refused, he has fabricated
the commissioner's murder case on him

1620
01:42:52,269 --> 01:42:55,570
The article clearly states his link
with Reddy in bold letters

1621
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,028
Who sent you to Australia?

1622
01:42:57,069 --> 01:42:58,125
For what purpose?

1623
01:42:58,150 --> 01:43:00,234
How do you know
I went to Australia?

1624
01:43:00,875 --> 01:43:02,207
Did Vittal Prasad tell you?

1625
01:43:03,507 --> 01:43:05,298
Are you here to do what he says?

1626
01:43:10,427 --> 01:43:11,801
Is it for India
or Australia?

1627
01:43:11,826 --> 01:43:12,826
Mr Duraisingam?

1628
01:43:14,028 --> 01:43:15,695
We are terminating you from CBI

1629
01:43:17,011 --> 01:43:21,429
People are under the impression
CBI will render justice to all cases

1630
01:43:21,876 --> 01:43:23,710
Don't tarnish that trust

1631
01:43:31,426 --> 01:43:33,468
I got to know all that happened

1632
01:43:35,162 --> 01:43:37,080
I don't want an apology from you now

1633
01:43:38,765 --> 01:43:41,223
I am relieving myself
from Tamil Nadu police

1634
01:43:41,487 --> 01:43:44,528
Give me a posting
as Andhra police

1635
01:43:45,402 --> 01:43:46,861
All I need is your signature

1636
01:43:47,141 --> 01:43:49,558
I will re-write his fate

1637
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:03,396
"He wore his khaki uniform you see"

1638
01:44:03,668 --> 01:44:07,385
âBottled within him red hot furyâ

1639
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:11,236
âHe will pound to a pulp mercilesslyâ

1640
01:44:11,883 --> 01:44:15,153
âWho will bear the brunt of his fury?â

1641
01:44:16,098 --> 01:44:19,195
âHe is second to none; extraordinaryâ

1642
01:44:20,037 --> 01:44:22,328
"Universal cop"

1643
01:44:28,192 --> 01:44:31,026
"Very, very sharp"

1644
01:44:36,423 --> 01:44:40,131
âJust a single strike from him will doâ

1645
01:44:40,551 --> 01:44:44,378
â1.5 ton force it will change intoâ

1646
01:44:44,732 --> 01:44:48,236
âIf he rises to bash, thatâs the endâ

1647
01:44:48,683 --> 01:44:52,100
âLike a missile he will descendâ

1648
01:44:52,582 --> 01:44:53,647
An unofficial target

1649
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,737
Transfer all the cops
who support Reddy, sir

1650
01:44:56,945 --> 01:44:59,986
"Universal cop"

1651
01:45:05,245 --> 01:45:07,912
"Very, very sharp"

1652
01:45:12,182 --> 01:45:14,670
If you lay a finger on us
we will complain to the judge

1653
01:45:14,838 --> 01:45:16,820
You can do so
only if you are alive!

1654
01:45:20,298 --> 01:45:21,956
If you blunder onceâ¦

1655
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:23,978
â¦and that too
knowing itâs wrong

1656
01:45:24,003 --> 01:45:26,986
...even if he is God Almighty
I will not spare him

1657
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:28,487
What is your name?

1658
01:45:28,487 --> 01:45:29,837
Mo...Moâ¦Moses, sir

1659
01:45:29,862 --> 01:45:31,044
Have you read the Bible?

1660
01:45:31,298 --> 01:45:33,970
- Do you know what Romans 6:23 says?
- No, sir

1661
01:45:34,163 --> 01:45:36,528
Wages of sin is death

1662
01:45:38,769 --> 01:45:39,468
What?

1663
01:45:39,493 --> 01:45:43,468
As a false witness you boldly
claimed you killed a police officer

1664
01:45:43,493 --> 01:45:45,270
Why are you flustered
looking at a murder?

1665
01:45:46,877 --> 01:45:48,612
These 3 have turned approvers
against Reddy

1666
01:45:48,822 --> 01:45:49,908
Reddy got wind of this

1667
01:45:50,105 --> 01:45:52,778
On the way to the judge's house
2 men were shot by Reddy's goons

1668
01:45:54,232 --> 01:45:56,565
You're repeating this story
verbatim to the judge

1669
01:45:57,663 --> 01:46:01,158
"In his police uniform to strike
with confidence he will stride"

1670
01:46:01,762 --> 01:46:05,372
"In just a single glance
heâll weigh his prey, pros and cons"

1671
01:46:05,862 --> 01:46:09,418
"In his police uniform to strike
Dash and daring, he will stride"

1672
01:46:09,719 --> 01:46:11,612
Reddy, DC has got
an arrest warrant on you

1673
01:46:12,071 --> 01:46:13,069
Turn the car

1674
01:46:13,263 --> 01:46:14,278
Reddy has been informed

1675
01:46:14,402 --> 01:46:15,771
He might try to escape

1676
01:46:16,154 --> 01:46:21,195
"Criminals with evil intentions
Forced to flee to different nations"

1677
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:22,947
"To wipe out crime in fact"

1678
01:46:22,972 --> 01:46:24,680
They are holding me captive, sir

1679
01:46:26,129 --> 01:46:29,462
"Is there any case he canât unlock?
This cop sure can walk the talk"

1680
01:46:29,487 --> 01:46:32,069
"Universal cop"

1681
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:36,330
"He is razor sharp"

1682
01:46:37,669 --> 01:46:40,086
"Universal cop"

1683
01:46:41,795 --> 01:46:43,070
"Very, very sharp"

1684
01:46:43,095 --> 01:46:46,637
'Duraisingam takes drastic action
against rowdies involved in the riot'

âNo hurdle is an obstacle
Letâs cross, really simpleâ

"Come on, rap-a-tap-tap"

1687
01:46:51,034 --> 01:46:53,053
India has 4800000 fishermen

1688
01:46:53,078 --> 01:46:54,737
20,000 boats sail in the high seas

1689
01:46:54,793 --> 01:46:56,612
Who are you?
Military in mufti

1690
01:46:56,612 --> 01:46:57,659
Unpaid navy!

1691
01:46:58,024 --> 01:47:00,028
No trespasser can enter
our nation defying you

1692
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:01,265
You shouldn't allow either

1693
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:03,236
"Rap-atap-tap"

1694
01:47:03,584 --> 01:47:05,278
"Like a volcano erupting"

01:47:05,652 --> 01:47:07,195
"Like birds with their wings flapping"

"To reach great heights, paths will favor"

"What he sets his mind to, heâll conquer"

âBravo! Dare to defyâ

1699
01:47:17,967 --> 01:47:19,509
âSpread your wings to flyâ

...medi-waste has been dumped

Underground water has turned toxic
to the effect of 1000 acres

I'll support you
in every step

1707
01:47:39,487 --> 01:47:41,904
No one should throw even
an used tea cup on the roads

1708
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,778
You should think twice even
before you light a matchstick!

"If anyone dares to take him for a ride"

I have to meet you immediately

- Right now?
- Yes

1714
01:47:58,622 --> 01:47:59,653
I'll meet you in Kailashgiri

1715
01:47:59,737 --> 01:48:02,111
"Universal cop"

1716
01:48:03,819 --> 01:48:06,528
"Very, very sharp"

1717
01:48:07,952 --> 01:48:09,028
What's up with you?

1718
01:48:09,085 --> 01:48:10,503
You came here
as a CBI officer

1719
01:48:10,649 --> 01:48:12,420
Now you're inviting
more and more trouble

1720
01:48:12,528 --> 01:48:13,647
I'm in a mood of fury
mixed with frenzy

1721
01:48:14,153 --> 01:48:15,236
Don't bug me

1722
01:48:15,283 --> 01:48:16,857
This city is totally different

1723
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:18,657
Why do you struggle here?

1724
01:48:19,393 --> 01:48:20,810
I am really petrified

1725
01:48:21,895 --> 01:48:23,320
Let's leave this
and go back home

1726
01:48:23,573 --> 01:48:25,945
If I get my hands on a case
I should either win or lose

1727
01:48:26,249 --> 01:48:27,361
I am standing in between

1728
01:48:27,664 --> 01:48:29,574
If you feel bad seeing
all this, just leave

1729
01:48:30,176 --> 01:48:31,323
Go back right away

1730
01:48:35,253 --> 01:48:37,378
Because you blabbered
in front of everyone...

1731
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:39,737
...he had no other go
but to claim he is divorced

1732
01:48:54,222 --> 01:48:56,737
I need to divorce my wife
Whom should I deal with?

1733
01:48:56,796 --> 01:48:58,893
- I'll deal this case
- What's your problem?

1734
01:48:58,918 --> 01:49:00,715
My wife goes on a show-off spree

1735
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:01,963
- Shows what?
- Anger

1736
01:49:01,988 --> 01:49:04,039
Sometimes when I ask her
to show, she refuses

1737
01:49:04,064 --> 01:49:05,819
- What is this?
- Love

1738
01:49:05,844 --> 01:49:07,094
He is being ambiguous

1739
01:49:07,278 --> 01:49:11,042
We lived together for 3 years
and bond was so strong

1740
01:49:11,067 --> 01:49:13,356
3 months after we got married
the ties loosened

1741
01:49:14,605 --> 01:49:15,938
What's 'livington gether'?

1742
01:49:16,185 --> 01:49:19,047
Without being formally married
living under the same roof informally

1743
01:49:19,072 --> 01:49:20,951
Stick together like glue
Or find someone new

1744
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:23,509
What's right about that?

1745
01:49:23,554 --> 01:49:24,952
In the case of
a couple divorcing...

1746
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:27,686
...if a rule is passed for money
got as wedding gifts to be returned

1747
01:49:28,077 --> 01:49:30,079
...will you go in for divorce?

1748
01:49:30,229 --> 01:49:32,312
Scumbags who have risen
to ruin our culture

1749
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:34,128
I'll butcher you

1750
01:49:35,221 --> 01:49:36,513
Why are you waiting here?

1751
01:49:37,916 --> 01:49:39,434
Working odd hours
or different city...

1752
01:49:39,459 --> 01:49:41,839
...so many feel terrible
not being with their spouse

1753
01:49:41,945 --> 01:49:43,487
You're demanding a divorce!

1754
01:49:48,919 --> 01:49:51,127
How dare you block all our containers!

1755
01:49:51,592 --> 01:49:54,709
"Fast & furious in strategem
Mean-machine Duraisingam"

1756
01:49:55,079 --> 01:49:56,653
"Power packed action is his emblem"

1757
01:50:03,265 --> 01:50:05,056
Dad, I am on my way to Vizag

1758
01:50:05,356 --> 01:50:08,397
That Duraisingam has to meet me
in my office at 12 noon

1759
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:14,071
Why are you hiding in
your home town now?

1760
01:50:14,374 --> 01:50:15,381
'Come immediately'

1761
01:50:15,426 --> 01:50:17,634
We will show him
Vizag is under our control

1762
01:50:29,974 --> 01:50:31,516
Dad, I've landed in Vizag

1763
01:50:33,559 --> 01:50:35,892
He will be in your office at 12:30

1764
01:50:36,069 --> 01:50:38,236
- Chief minister will call you now
- Why?

1765
01:50:38,317 --> 01:50:39,753
Don't be tense

1766
01:50:39,814 --> 01:50:40,768
I'll handle everything

1767
01:50:40,828 --> 01:50:41,994
I don't get it
For what, sir?

1768
01:50:42,162 --> 01:50:43,904
From State minister to central ministers...

1769
01:50:43,929 --> 01:50:46,304
'...they are pulling strings
to release the containers'

1770
01:50:50,595 --> 01:50:53,762
He is so stubborn as to insist
you meet him by 12:30 in his office

1771
01:51:02,827 --> 01:51:03,693
Wrong, sir

1772
01:51:23,462 --> 01:51:25,879
If you have to be here
at this particular time...

1773
01:51:25,904 --> 01:51:27,813
...in Opera house, Sydney, Australia

1774
01:51:27,838 --> 01:51:31,005
At 33.8Â° latitude
151.2Â° longitude

1775
01:51:31,187 --> 01:51:32,562
I decided yesterday

1776
01:51:33,487 --> 01:51:34,945
Do you realize at least now?

1777
01:51:38,167 --> 01:51:40,584
Necessity is not the reason
for earning all this money

1778
01:51:40,961 --> 01:51:42,335
To get a 'high'

1779
01:51:42,445 --> 01:51:43,904
2 million a month

1780
01:51:43,962 --> 01:51:45,445
Even though you can accept bribes...

1781
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:48,803
...if working for a meager salary
of 60000 is your passion

1782
01:51:53,962 --> 01:51:56,837
My company has
 6400000 share holders

1783
01:51:56,907 --> 01:51:59,795
12,300 employees
in my company

1784
01:52:09,086 --> 01:52:10,587
What crime did I commit?

1785
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:13,411
I brought all the rubbish
and dumped it in your trash cans

1786
01:52:13,862 --> 01:52:16,278
You dump your trash
only on your roads

1787
01:52:16,432 --> 01:52:18,195
You pee on your walls

1788
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:20,986
Your whole country
is a land of rubbish bins

1789
01:52:24,344 --> 01:52:25,969
What are you trying to say?

1790
01:52:26,477 --> 01:52:28,653
The containers you blocked
in the beginning...

1791
01:52:28,906 --> 01:52:30,503
...release them from the port

1792
01:52:30,585 --> 01:52:32,445
...sit in a toll booth
and issue tokens

1793
01:52:32,636 --> 01:52:33,612
And then...?

1794
01:52:33,948 --> 01:52:35,778
Close Reddy's file at once

1795
01:52:45,528 --> 01:52:47,862
- Where is Reddy now?
- Heading towards Vizag, sir

1796
01:52:47,887 --> 01:52:50,052
- How many kilometers?
- 80 km, sir

1797
01:52:59,074 --> 01:53:00,783
Stop the car...stop!

1798
01:53:01,743 --> 01:53:03,590
"The cop with a mission"

1799
01:53:03,938 --> 01:53:05,438
Hit and finish him off

1800
01:53:09,131 --> 01:53:10,249
Stop...stop...!

1801
01:53:10,274 --> 01:53:12,774
"Cop who rules the game
Duraisingam is his name"

1802
01:53:13,127 --> 01:53:14,188
Reverse the car

1803
01:53:14,324 --> 01:53:15,866
"Courage is his surname"

1804
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:22,085
"Deadly ultimatum
Decreed by Duraisingam"

1805
01:53:23,454 --> 01:53:24,454
Smash him

1806
01:53:37,657 --> 01:53:38,908
Turn right

1807
01:53:43,033 --> 01:53:44,407
Block his car

1808
01:54:10,335 --> 01:54:11,418
Get the car here

1809
01:54:38,101 --> 01:54:40,278
If you let him be like this,
how long will he be alive?

1810
01:54:42,331 --> 01:54:46,890
Hey! We will take immense pleasure
in watching you suffer and die slowly

1811
01:54:47,863 --> 01:54:49,654
All of you, sit down

1812
01:54:51,953 --> 01:54:52,953
Kill me

1813
01:54:53,161 --> 01:54:54,327
Does it hurt?

1814
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:56,303
Think you can die
without the pain?

1815
01:54:57,365 --> 01:54:58,824
It's easy to die

1816
01:54:58,967 --> 01:55:00,342
Tough to live

1817
01:55:00,483 --> 01:55:02,608
To lead life as a good man
is doubly difficult

1818
01:55:02,932 --> 01:55:05,932
Extremely difficult to live
without hurting others

1819
01:55:06,371 --> 01:55:09,371
Not only did you kill
an honest police officer...

1820
01:55:09,491 --> 01:55:12,616
...but you also tarnished
that good soul's name in court

1821
01:55:12,824 --> 01:55:14,353
I decided that day

1822
01:55:14,575 --> 01:55:15,874
An arrest is easy way out for you

1823
01:55:15,912 --> 01:55:17,495
You should go to hell

1824
01:55:18,141 --> 01:55:19,599
6 years ago

1825
01:55:20,175 --> 01:55:22,724
...to save Vittal's father's position

1826
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:24,708
...you created a riot in the city

1827
01:55:25,019 --> 01:55:26,591
Do you remember that?

1828
01:55:26,616 --> 01:55:27,949
In that riot...

1829
01:55:28,066 --> 01:55:32,074
...you toppled a school van with
18 children with no compassion whatsoever!

1830
01:55:34,570 --> 01:55:36,320
A child in that van died

1831
01:55:36,633 --> 01:55:38,008
Are you aware of that?

1832
01:55:39,566 --> 01:55:41,274
That child's father...

1833
01:55:41,699 --> 01:55:44,741
...is an honest police officer?
Do you know that?

1834
01:55:49,969 --> 01:55:53,158
Subbu, I know the pain
in your heart can never fade

1835
01:55:53,407 --> 01:55:55,074
But shoot him

1836
01:55:55,504 --> 01:55:57,239
And soothe your pain
with this medicine

1837
01:55:57,978 --> 01:55:59,229
Come on

1838
01:56:09,904 --> 01:56:11,362
He led a royal life like a king

1839
01:56:11,404 --> 01:56:13,029
He's an abandoned corpse now

1840
01:56:14,053 --> 01:56:16,845
What gall Duraisingam has
to execute him like this?

1841
01:56:17,419 --> 01:56:18,502
In this country...

1842
01:56:18,872 --> 01:56:20,854
...police officers have been
 given this kind of power?

1843
01:56:20,879 --> 01:56:23,920
First talk to your dad and find
a way to move the containers

1844
01:56:33,292 --> 01:56:35,049
A policeman's family

1845
01:56:35,183 --> 01:56:37,866
...fearing for their lives and
evacuating because of a criminal

1846
01:56:37,891 --> 01:56:40,057
...should never be in
any official record

1847
01:56:40,232 --> 01:56:43,356
I'll always be there for you
with my band of loyal men

1848
01:56:48,866 --> 01:56:50,158
My dear lad

1849
01:56:52,611 --> 01:56:56,028
My girls are able to go to school
without any hassle nowadays

1850
01:57:04,349 --> 01:57:05,952
Where's my man?
I must meet him immediately

1851
01:57:05,999 --> 01:57:07,166
Listen, Vidya

1852
01:57:07,361 --> 01:57:09,070
He hasn't divorced his wife

1853
01:57:09,113 --> 01:57:10,904
His wife is happily married to him

1854
01:57:11,004 --> 01:57:12,844
Wipe out all your plans
from your scheming head

1855
01:57:14,673 --> 01:57:16,324
I warned you the other day

1856
01:57:16,391 --> 01:57:17,808
But you didn't believe me

1857
01:57:18,343 --> 01:57:20,676
You could've dinned it
into my head, right?

1858
01:57:22,921 --> 01:57:25,088
In such a way I would
have got the message

1859
01:57:26,117 --> 01:57:28,450
Used cuss words to
make me come to my senses

1860
01:57:30,414 --> 01:57:32,389
Or hit me hard
and hammered it in

1861
01:57:32,697 --> 01:57:33,866
Why are you crying?

1862
01:57:34,243 --> 01:57:35,606
Vidya...look at me

1863
01:57:35,914 --> 01:57:37,372
Stop crying, please

1864
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:42,792
They've transferred me, sir

1865
01:57:56,213 --> 01:57:57,985
Duraisingam has blocked
all our containers

1866
01:57:58,046 --> 01:57:59,429
The Press is swarming there

1867
01:58:04,749 --> 01:58:06,713
Why have you stopped them?

1868
01:58:07,023 --> 01:58:08,672
All the containers have
been cleared by Customs

1869
01:58:08,861 --> 01:58:10,773
- You got no right to stop this
- Fat hopes!

1870
01:58:11,158 --> 01:58:12,414
340 acres

1871
01:58:12,439 --> 01:58:14,276
Only the harbor is
under central Govt

1872
01:58:15,570 --> 01:58:17,195
Other than that, the entire State

1873
01:58:17,324 --> 01:58:18,783
...is under our control!

1874
01:58:18,906 --> 01:58:20,144
Shut up and stand aside

1875
01:58:28,472 --> 01:58:30,098
Sir, what's all this?

1876
01:58:35,752 --> 01:58:37,122
Why don't you arrest them, sir?

1877
01:58:37,147 --> 01:58:39,396
We can but they will claim
they sent the wrong load

1878
01:58:39,585 --> 01:58:41,033
And they will agree
to send it back!

1879
01:58:41,058 --> 01:58:42,391
Who is behind this, sir?

1880
01:58:43,092 --> 01:58:44,991
Maybe a business man in Australia

1881
01:58:45,041 --> 01:58:47,741
May be a millionaire too

1882
01:58:48,174 --> 01:58:51,074
All your 'mays' are assumptions
How will you find out?

1883
01:58:53,365 --> 01:58:54,782
I know you are watching me

1884
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:58,359
Vittal has to come and meet me
in my station at sharp 11'o clock

1885
01:58:58,425 --> 01:58:59,317
Our boss isn't here

1886
01:58:59,585 --> 01:59:01,608
The entire Press wants
to know the details

1887
01:59:01,725 --> 01:59:03,225
If I open my mouth...

1888
01:59:03,310 --> 01:59:04,384
40 press, 400 policemen...

1889
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:06,012
...customs, pollution control board

1890
01:59:06,057 --> 01:59:07,623
...tahsildars, sub registrars, collectors

1891
01:59:07,691 --> 01:59:09,071
...will queue outside your office

1892
01:59:09,241 --> 01:59:10,275
If he comes around 11-

1893
01:59:10,324 --> 01:59:11,414
Around or ground!

1894
01:59:11,532 --> 01:59:14,532
Don't come with your stooges
hovering and covering for you

1895
01:59:15,981 --> 01:59:17,273
You must come alone

1896
01:59:25,033 --> 01:59:26,657
All of you
wait outside

1897
01:59:32,837 --> 01:59:35,879
You decided to meet me in your office
just the day before

1898
01:59:36,303 --> 01:59:37,940
To make you stand here...

1899
01:59:37,979 --> 01:59:39,895
...I decided the day I met you!

1900
01:59:40,284 --> 01:59:42,525
That's why the container
I should've opened long ago...

1901
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:44,216
...I opened it today!

1902
01:59:44,749 --> 01:59:46,932
Making money
gives you a high, huh?

1903
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:49,553
Then get sloshed and
be sprawled somewhere

1904
01:59:53,979 --> 01:59:56,727
If you work for a living in a country
of kangaroos and wolves...

1905
01:59:56,783 --> 01:59:58,449
...and you have such temerity

1906
01:59:58,449 --> 02:00:01,365
...then living in a land of glory
 with lions, tigers and cheetahs

1907
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:03,515
...imagine my pride and arrogance!

1908
02:00:03,970 --> 02:00:08,428
You're dumping trash in lakes and ponds
providing water for farming and drinking

1909
02:00:08,521 --> 02:00:10,437
Your conscience doesn't prick?

1910
02:00:10,622 --> 02:00:12,080
32 innocent children

1911
02:00:12,721 --> 02:00:15,138
...gasped for breath
because of you and-

1912
02:00:15,932 --> 02:00:17,307
You have no regret?

1913
02:00:17,692 --> 02:00:19,360
And you have the gall to be cheeky!

1914
02:00:19,686 --> 02:00:21,686
God has blessed you
with abundance

1915
02:00:21,711 --> 02:00:24,294
Then why do you pinch
another man's bread and butter?

1916
02:00:24,866 --> 02:00:29,241
Maligning your homeland is equal to
deriding one's own dear mother

1917
02:00:30,373 --> 02:00:33,540
Instead of littering chocolate wrappers
on the roadside, nowadays...

1918
02:00:33,565 --> 02:00:37,190
...school kids stuff them in their pockets
to trash it only in a dust bin

1919
02:00:37,382 --> 02:00:38,966
Trash bins in every street corner

1920
02:00:39,083 --> 02:00:41,036
And toilets in every road
That day will dawn soon

1921
02:00:41,110 --> 02:00:43,693
Then our country will be
in a different level altogether

1922
02:00:43,886 --> 02:00:46,241
You dare trash my country
as a rubbish bin?

1923
02:00:55,973 --> 02:00:57,973
Our country is rich in resources

1924
02:01:01,135 --> 02:01:03,755
I can strip you right now
and remand you to police custody

1925
02:01:04,375 --> 02:01:05,522
But if I do so...

1926
02:01:05,567 --> 02:01:09,692
...your employees, share holders
and general public will be affected

1927
02:01:10,627 --> 02:01:12,418
I'll give you another chance

1928
02:01:13,127 --> 02:01:15,918
If you put an end to this
shameful profession and surrender

1929
02:01:18,339 --> 02:01:20,048
But if I catch you-

1930
02:01:28,616 --> 02:01:29,824
Yes, sir?

1931
02:01:30,638 --> 02:01:31,846
I'm in Mumbai

1932
02:01:36,245 --> 02:01:38,286
Will you act smart?
Will you say that?

1933
02:01:39,499 --> 02:01:41,155
Why are you hitting
an innocent kid?

1934
02:01:41,212 --> 02:01:44,295
If I say something, he retorts
in a bad way, using swear words, sir

1935
02:01:44,325 --> 02:01:46,908
Normally we yell at our wives
May be 500 - 1000 cuss words

1936
02:01:47,004 --> 02:01:50,420
Do you know this kid's cuss word
vocabulary at this tender age?

1937
02:01:51,626 --> 02:01:52,512
Ask him a question

1938
02:01:52,688 --> 02:01:53,676
Hear his twisted reply

1939
02:01:53,906 --> 02:01:55,773
Don't hit him
Let me ask him

1940
02:01:55,822 --> 02:01:57,238
Smart chap, tell me

1941
02:01:57,323 --> 02:01:59,824
- Daddy
- Rowdy!

1942
02:02:00,491 --> 02:02:02,741
- Mummy
- Dummy

1943
02:02:03,458 --> 02:02:06,493
- Fire, dude
- Slipper you!

1944
02:02:06,738 --> 02:02:08,030
Water

1945
02:02:08,104 --> 02:02:09,562
Sir, don't ask further

1946
02:02:09,587 --> 02:02:10,872
He'll bitch about your mother!

1947
02:02:10,971 --> 02:02:12,595
My father's name is Kathamuthu

1948
02:02:12,716 --> 02:02:14,519
I named him after my father
with so much love

1949
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:16,201
Ask him his name

1950
02:02:16,247 --> 02:02:17,539
Let me go in his own route

1951
02:02:17,675 --> 02:02:18,841
My dear lad

1952
02:02:18,879 --> 02:02:20,253
Tell me your grandpa's name

1953
02:02:20,365 --> 02:02:21,699
Katha-muthu

1954
02:02:21,724 --> 02:02:22,891
Psychopath-u!

1955
02:02:22,916 --> 02:02:25,207
That's why I told you
Arrest and put him in jail!

1956
02:02:25,274 --> 02:02:27,562
You should be thrown into prison

1957
02:02:27,627 --> 02:02:29,841
If you talk to your wife
with your kid around...

1958
02:02:29,883 --> 02:02:31,522
...you should speak
words of fragrance

1959
02:02:31,547 --> 02:02:32,961
- Fragrant words?
- I mean

1960
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:34,783
For example
hear this

1961
02:02:35,349 --> 02:02:36,683
My dear precious gem

1962
02:02:36,949 --> 02:02:38,866
My sweet cuckoo
Listen to me

1963
02:02:39,002 --> 02:02:40,092
Whatever I tell you now...

1964
02:02:40,249 --> 02:02:42,374
...follow my lip movement

1965
02:02:42,399 --> 02:02:44,035
And you rhyme properly, okay?

1966
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:45,232
Rose

1967
02:02:45,330 --> 02:02:46,789
Garland

1968
02:02:46,983 --> 02:02:48,357
What's that 'aah' for?

1969
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:51,772
Rose-garland

1970
02:02:51,797 --> 02:02:53,807
'*** ** * *****'

1971
02:02:53,832 --> 02:02:54,916
Heard that?

1972
02:02:58,381 --> 02:03:00,185
You can be a businessman
in Australia

1973
02:03:00,867 --> 02:03:03,639
From what he says
it has to be Vittal Prasad

1974
02:03:03,664 --> 02:03:05,736
If interviewed in
 a crisscross way

1975
02:03:05,799 --> 02:03:07,382
...he'll certainly blabber something

1976
02:03:07,445 --> 02:03:08,987
Do you need all this?

1977
02:03:09,275 --> 02:03:10,965
Duraisingam sir needs him

1978
02:03:11,097 --> 02:03:12,264
For my stupid mistake...

1979
02:03:12,351 --> 02:03:13,809
...I must compensate somehow

1980
02:03:13,834 --> 02:03:16,250
Keep an eye on Madurawada
and Walter's area

1981
02:03:16,530 --> 02:03:17,947
- Pa?
- Durai

1982
02:03:18,358 --> 02:03:19,205
Tell me, pa

1983
02:03:19,299 --> 02:03:21,967
Kavya's grandma passed away!

1984
02:03:25,393 --> 02:03:27,352
We have to leave now
To your hometown

1985
02:03:27,684 --> 02:03:28,934
Why all of a sudden?

1986
02:03:29,464 --> 02:03:31,089
Meet me at the airport, I'll tell you

1987
02:03:41,508 --> 02:03:43,616
I'm heading to Chennai
for a meeting, sir

1988
02:03:47,555 --> 02:03:49,138
What happened?

1989
02:03:50,241 --> 02:03:51,741
Your grandma...

1990
02:03:53,269 --> 02:03:54,643
...passed away it seems!

1991
02:03:57,991 --> 02:03:59,064
I think she's his wife

1992
02:04:00,654 --> 02:04:03,156
Until I get her details
follow her, okay?

1993
02:04:05,819 --> 02:04:07,069
Grandma

1994
02:04:15,926 --> 02:04:17,676
He was close to a female here

1995
02:04:25,298 --> 02:04:27,732
They've web-checked already
into a Chennai-Tuticorin flight

1996
02:04:38,008 --> 02:04:40,134
Let me carry it for you
Car is waiting, sir

1997
02:04:44,288 --> 02:04:45,789
Follow that car

1998
02:04:50,249 --> 02:04:51,216
- Pazhani...?
- Sir...?

1999
02:04:51,241 --> 02:04:52,866
Pull the car to the kerb

2000
02:05:02,741 --> 02:05:04,407
Hey! Start the car
Reverse...quick

2001
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:09,449
Go...go...fast

2002
02:05:16,574 --> 02:05:18,711
What gall! You'll follow
a police officer?

2003
02:05:18,736 --> 02:05:20,419
Who are you? Let go of me, sir

2004
02:05:20,444 --> 02:05:22,610
I followed without knowing
it was sir's car!

2005
02:05:22,635 --> 02:05:25,760
Who the hell asked you
to follow a police officer?

2006
02:05:25,956 --> 02:05:27,909
Girl in the photo
is Duraisingam's wife

2007
02:05:27,987 --> 02:05:29,653
India Cycles owner's daughter

2008
02:05:30,195 --> 02:05:31,330
You're Vittal's fake beneficiary

2009
02:05:31,379 --> 02:05:34,254
You were going to Chennai for a meeting
Why did you follow me?

2010
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:36,315
Sir, should I come there?

2011
02:05:37,928 --> 02:05:39,886
You sent our photo
in WhatsApp?

2012
02:05:40,041 --> 02:05:41,750
Received the reply by Telegram

2013
02:05:41,933 --> 02:05:45,766
Either you should've stopped tailing me
 in Chennai or Tuticorin airport

2014
02:05:45,866 --> 02:05:48,200
Instead you're following us
till our hometown?

2015
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:53,049
We got all the details
of that girl

2016
02:05:53,108 --> 02:05:54,546
You come back, okay?

2017
02:05:54,578 --> 02:05:56,162
How will he get back?

2018
02:05:59,007 --> 02:06:00,117
He can only take an U turn!

2019
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:01,659
After we pound him to a paste...

2020
02:06:01,746 --> 02:06:03,768
...if he drags your name
 in Tuticorin court

2021
02:06:03,908 --> 02:06:05,475
...his voice will echo in Vizag court!

2022
02:06:06,912 --> 02:06:08,501
A boat is leaving for Andaman

2023
02:06:08,562 --> 02:06:10,146
Shall we board him into it?

2024
02:06:10,216 --> 02:06:11,495
He won't make it

2025
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:14,269
Keep him in a launch in the sea
near Nallathanni Theevu

2026
02:06:15,705 --> 02:06:17,664
You stay here
I'll go in and come

2027
02:06:24,908 --> 02:06:27,241
But she wrote an article
against Duraisingam, sir

2028
02:06:31,515 --> 02:06:32,299
Ask her to come in

2029
02:06:32,365 --> 02:06:33,699
Unload it there

2030
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:02,130
That reporter is recording everything
with a hidden camera in her bag

2031
02:07:12,365 --> 02:07:14,407
You're # 1 in the Steel industry-

2032
02:07:15,327 --> 02:07:16,828
She's Duraisingam's girlfriend!

2033
02:07:20,269 --> 02:07:22,642
Which country do you
take iron wastes from?

2034
02:07:23,437 --> 02:07:25,220
Which country
do you take it from?

2035
02:07:28,241 --> 02:07:30,325
You are a business tycoon in Australia

2036
02:07:30,441 --> 02:07:31,976
E-waste, medi-waste

2037
02:07:32,001 --> 02:07:33,792
Did Duraisingam send you here?

2038
02:07:35,054 --> 02:07:37,179
Did Duraisingam send you
to ask me all this?

2039
02:08:02,385 --> 02:08:04,094
- Came in to interview
- No one came

2040
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:12,807
She's a good bait

2041
02:08:12,849 --> 02:08:15,154
Using her, we can bring out
Rajeev Krishna very easily

2042
02:08:18,024 --> 02:08:19,398
Pack her up

2043
02:08:21,661 --> 02:08:23,120
- She came in
- You're mistaken

2044
02:08:29,052 --> 02:08:30,866
- Who is this?
- I'm Vidya's friend

2045
02:08:30,976 --> 02:08:34,491
- What happened?
- To help you she went to interview Vittal

2046
02:08:34,541 --> 02:08:35,874
She texted me
she had a problem

2047
02:08:35,913 --> 02:08:37,997
But when I enquired
they deny even seeing her!

2048
02:08:38,691 --> 02:08:40,108
Send me Vidya's phone number

2049
02:08:45,324 --> 02:08:46,699
Called me directly

2050
02:08:46,699 --> 02:08:48,491
That girl has nothing to do with it

2051
02:08:48,633 --> 02:08:49,443
Leave her alone

2052
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:53,009
If she isn't connected
why are you calling her?

2053
02:08:53,866 --> 02:08:55,991
You have your wife in the factory...

2054
02:08:56,396 --> 02:08:58,053
...telling the whole world
you're a divorcee

2055
02:08:58,122 --> 02:08:59,788
...are you dating this girl?

2056
02:09:00,612 --> 02:09:01,654
Your wife...

2057
02:09:01,699 --> 02:09:03,200
...looks beautiful

2058
02:09:03,513 --> 02:09:04,680
Such a stunner!

2059
02:09:12,741 --> 02:09:14,033
I'll let go of him

2060
02:09:14,074 --> 02:09:15,179
I can only send him by road

2061
02:09:17,202 --> 02:09:18,505
Can't get him on a flight

2062
02:09:18,558 --> 02:09:20,068
- He got hurt a little bit
- Hurt...?

2063
02:09:35,241 --> 02:09:36,680
Ask your men
to hand him over

2064
02:09:45,028 --> 02:09:47,154
But your signal has to
be only in Tutitcorin

2065
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:50,071
If you do your police gimmicks
and intelligence...

2066
02:10:05,401 --> 02:10:07,027
You leave immediately

2067
02:10:07,251 --> 02:10:09,074
No, Kavya
How can I go-?

2068
02:10:09,099 --> 02:10:10,141
It's alright

2069
02:10:10,578 --> 02:10:13,079
Divya is coming from London
only tomorrow morning

2070
02:10:13,345 --> 02:10:14,804
We'll attend to
the funeral rites

2071
02:10:15,017 --> 02:10:16,017
Attend to your work

2072
02:10:20,083 --> 02:10:21,916
My mobile signal should
show only Tuticorin

2073
02:10:21,981 --> 02:10:24,064
I'm on my way to Vizag
but I must take all calls

2074
02:10:24,118 --> 02:10:26,118
Calls shouldn't get diverted
Is there a way?

2075
02:10:26,242 --> 02:10:27,784
Buy a prepaid card from that area

2076
02:10:27,809 --> 02:10:30,091
Send me the sim number
at the back of that card

2077
02:10:30,137 --> 02:10:32,012
In half an hour
I can double activate it

2078
02:10:32,324 --> 02:10:34,478
We are sailing
to mid sea, sir

2079
02:10:34,503 --> 02:10:35,337
Come back to the shore

2080
02:10:41,833 --> 02:10:43,042
Get him into the car

2081
02:10:46,024 --> 02:10:47,311
Leave immediately with him

2082
02:10:47,366 --> 02:10:48,741
I'll take the next flight to Vizag

2083
02:10:48,766 --> 02:10:50,974
You'll reach Naidupettai
toll gate only at 3:00 a.m

2084
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:52,800
By then I'll find out
where that girl is

2085
02:10:52,841 --> 02:10:54,632
Shanmugam, ask few of your men...

2086
02:10:54,725 --> 02:10:56,559
...to follow that jeep
at a distance of 300 meters

2087
02:10:56,949 --> 02:10:58,117
Rest over the phone

2088
02:10:59,005 --> 02:11:00,338
I'll land in Vizag by 8:30

2089
02:11:00,507 --> 02:11:02,674
Call Vidya's friend
and get all the details

2090
02:11:21,073 --> 02:11:23,750
Check all the toll gates in
the suburbs with this car number

2091
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:25,134
I'll reach in 1 and 1/2 hours

2092
02:11:32,241 --> 02:11:33,699
Bro, we are entering Andhra

2093
02:11:35,218 --> 02:11:36,377
When we traced that car...

2094
02:11:36,402 --> 02:11:37,632
...it has crossed
Port road tollgate

2095
02:11:41,598 --> 02:11:43,140
Sir, please come

2096
02:11:44,013 --> 02:11:45,262
This is the car

2097
02:11:45,491 --> 02:11:46,866
Please zoom in

2098
02:11:47,455 --> 02:11:49,026
Would it have crossed
the next toll gate?

2099
02:11:49,068 --> 02:11:51,526
You can view footages of
all toll gates on NH 5, sir

2100
02:11:53,407 --> 02:11:55,699
That car hasn't crossed
Aganampudi as yet, sir

2101
02:11:56,942 --> 02:11:58,942
Then it has crossed
the same toll gate again

2102
02:11:59,142 --> 02:12:00,767
Show me footages
of return vehicles

2103
02:12:00,792 --> 02:12:02,917
Sir, that vehicle has
returned in 8 minutes

2104
02:12:03,407 --> 02:12:05,103
Maybe they took
the girl back to the city?

2105
02:12:05,128 --> 02:12:06,610
Or transferred her to another car

2106
02:12:06,679 --> 02:12:09,846
Show me footages from Aganampudi
in the 5:00 to 5.30 time frame

2107
02:12:13,185 --> 02:12:13,913
In this...

2108
02:12:13,938 --> 02:12:15,938
...which vehicles didn't
cross this toll gate?

2109
02:12:16,118 --> 02:12:16,985
I'll connect, sir

2110
02:12:17,736 --> 02:12:20,153
Only 1 ambulance hasn't
crossed this toll gate as yet

2111
02:12:20,421 --> 02:12:23,629
That ambulance has returned
in 10 minutes to Aganampudi toll gate

2112
02:12:24,683 --> 02:12:26,349
'Returned immediately?'

2113
02:12:29,991 --> 02:12:31,413
Metro Charity Trust ambulance

2114
02:12:44,379 --> 02:12:46,128
A girl who is unwell is missing

2115
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:48,350
- Is she admitted here?
- This is public charity hospital

2116
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:51,749
That too, if you search at this hour
all the patients will be disturbed, sir

2117
02:12:52,254 --> 02:12:53,587
You must be right, I agree

2118
02:12:56,545 --> 02:12:59,128
Sir, what is this?
You thrust that girl in here

2119
02:12:59,170 --> 02:13:01,337
Somehow the damn cops sniffed
their way in here, sir

2120
02:13:01,362 --> 02:13:02,362
What do you mean?

2121
02:13:06,337 --> 02:13:08,003
Sir, you've come back here agai-

2122
02:13:08,821 --> 02:13:10,280
Policemen are dogs, huh?!

2123
02:13:11,550 --> 02:13:13,883
I placed a phone here to
overhear your conversation

2124
02:13:20,413 --> 02:13:22,580
- We are at the toll gate
- Hold on, I'll call you

2125
02:13:26,981 --> 02:13:27,981
Wait

2126
02:13:50,253 --> 02:13:52,443
To take revenge on me
Vittal has a girl as hostage

2127
02:13:52,812 --> 02:13:55,472
Can't take her to any other hospital
Can I go to our factory hospital?

2128
02:13:55,537 --> 02:13:58,245
Take her immediately
I'll get everything organized

2129
02:14:08,194 --> 02:14:11,254
By mixing Propofol with morphine
they have administered an overdose

2130
02:14:11,254 --> 02:14:14,087
She won't regain consciousness
for another 3 days

2131
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:15,920
But not treating her
is also very risky

2132
02:14:17,396 --> 02:14:19,128
If she should regain
consciousness?

2133
02:14:26,372 --> 02:14:27,587
Sir, I need your signature

2134
02:14:43,394 --> 02:14:45,811
Central minister Mr Ramprasad
 is on the line

2135
02:14:45,811 --> 02:14:48,145
Your son-in-law is disturbing
my son too much

2136
02:14:48,354 --> 02:14:49,712
Why are you telling me this?

2137
02:14:49,818 --> 02:14:53,504
Then don't ask me if your son-in-law is
found stabbed in the middle of the road

2138
02:14:53,856 --> 02:14:56,379
Similarly if your son is shot
in the open by my son-in-law-

2139
02:14:56,420 --> 02:14:57,878
What audacity!

2140
02:14:59,115 --> 02:15:00,524
I have no son as heir

2141
02:15:00,756 --> 02:15:03,753
Half my wealth of 120 billion,
60 billion is his

2142
02:15:04,181 --> 02:15:07,587
If he has renounced this lap of luxury,
working for a salary of Rs 65000 only

2143
02:15:08,334 --> 02:15:10,295
...what fervent fury
he must possess

2144
02:15:10,994 --> 02:15:12,836
First ask your son to surrender

2145
02:15:14,448 --> 02:15:17,612
Make an appointment with the judge
for 10:30 p.m to get an arrest warrant

2146
02:15:17,687 --> 02:15:19,271
But don't disclose the name

2147
02:15:19,487 --> 02:15:21,337
Every single word
I speak to the judge

2148
02:15:21,617 --> 02:15:22,753
The evidence I submit

2149
02:15:23,134 --> 02:15:24,962
...should be relayed
'live' for the general public

2150
02:15:27,483 --> 02:15:29,125
Here is your ticket to Hyderabad

2151
02:15:29,150 --> 02:15:30,150
Drop Vidya at home

2152
02:15:30,614 --> 02:15:32,045
I'm not going anywhere, sir

2153
02:15:32,196 --> 02:15:34,671
Look here, I am not prepared
to lose people close to me

2154
02:15:35,585 --> 02:15:36,835
What did you say, sir?

2155
02:15:37,187 --> 02:15:38,420
I said, 'leave now'

2156
02:15:38,766 --> 02:15:41,254
You said something like
'people close to you'

2157
02:15:42,882 --> 02:15:45,878
I thought you'll regard me
as your enemy for all my blunders

2158
02:15:48,474 --> 02:15:51,920
I thought I was doing you a favor
when I first fell in love with you

2159
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:55,254
Only when I knew
you won't reciprocate my love...

2160
02:15:55,366 --> 02:15:57,504
...I knew how truly
I was in love with you

2161
02:16:00,707 --> 02:16:02,587
I am unable to forget you, sir

2162
02:16:06,687 --> 02:16:08,937
If I lock myself in my room
and cry the whole day...

2163
02:16:08,980 --> 02:16:10,712
...I'll forget everything, sir

2164
02:16:25,596 --> 02:16:28,045
- What happened to that vehicle?
- Not starting

2165
02:16:32,870 --> 02:16:34,170
- Be brave
- Okay, bro

2166
02:16:36,924 --> 02:16:39,128
- I can see the red car
- Go inside

2167
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:15,904
- Hey...you there!
- I placed it there, bro

2168
02:17:19,778 --> 02:17:21,170
- Careful, sir
- Srinivas

2169
02:17:21,445 --> 02:17:23,069
Call the ambulance

2170
02:17:49,118 --> 02:17:51,576
4 cops died in a bomb blast
in the police station it seems

2171
02:17:53,985 --> 02:17:55,145
Why did you let the Press in?

2172
02:17:55,268 --> 02:17:57,962
I have no hang ups about
media knowing the case details

2173
02:17:58,036 --> 02:17:59,420
Do you have any problems, sir?

2174
02:17:59,462 --> 02:18:00,545
I have no problem

2175
02:18:00,663 --> 02:18:01,629
Tell me
Which case?

2176
02:18:07,683 --> 02:18:10,225
- What is this?
- 435 documents and agreements

2177
02:18:10,482 --> 02:18:13,023
Agreements signed by many
medical universities for medi-waste

2178
02:18:13,048 --> 02:18:14,632
How did he get hold of all this?

2179
02:18:14,734 --> 02:18:16,920
Soft copies from
my Super computer

2180
02:18:29,257 --> 02:18:30,449
All this is documentary evidence

2181
02:18:31,155 --> 02:18:34,486
Vittal Prasad's fake beneficiary
Rajeev Krishna has turned approver

2182
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:49,736
District judge and collector
of Tuticorin are with him

2183
02:19:01,321 --> 02:19:03,270
Subbu, block his passport at once

2184
02:19:03,517 --> 02:19:04,753
He shouldn't cross the city limits

2185
02:19:04,849 --> 02:19:06,462
We must arrest him before dawn

2186
02:19:14,555 --> 02:19:16,389
Our boss isnât here

2187
02:19:21,395 --> 02:19:23,462
Vittal's number is switched off
in S.K Nagar tower

2188
02:19:23,554 --> 02:19:24,195
Unable to track it

2189
02:19:24,220 --> 02:19:25,984
He would have definitely
called his dad

2190
02:19:42,484 --> 02:19:45,630
Central minister hasn't received
any call after 12 midnight, sir

2191
02:19:46,679 --> 02:19:49,281
Murali, through signal
triangulation method...

2192
02:19:49,454 --> 02:19:52,295
...can't we find out the numbers
in and around the minister's number?

2193
02:19:55,277 --> 02:19:57,545
Sir, there's a London number
next to the ministerâs signal

2194
02:19:57,764 --> 02:19:59,999
That number has been
receiving calls from Australia

2195
02:20:00,059 --> 02:20:03,143
The Australian number was switched on
at 12:15 in S.K Nagar tower

2196
02:20:03,330 --> 02:20:05,172
In the next 1/2 hour
crossing the Gail toll gate...

2197
02:20:05,222 --> 02:20:06,763
...it has moved
down the highway

2198
02:20:06,788 --> 02:20:09,163
I'm sure this is the number
Trace its signal

2199
02:20:19,934 --> 02:20:21,694
He will reach Vijayawada
in 2 and 1/2 hours

2200
02:20:21,719 --> 02:20:23,219
Any flight now to Vijayawada?

2201
02:20:23,406 --> 02:20:24,531
In 1 hour

2202
02:20:31,192 --> 02:20:34,317
The signal crossing Vijayawada
is on the highway to Hyderabad now

2203
02:20:35,038 --> 02:20:37,830
He's trying to catch the 11:30
Malindo flight to Malaysia

2204
02:20:43,737 --> 02:20:45,696
Sir, you're 500 meters away

2205
02:20:48,466 --> 02:20:51,674
- I can see only a container ahead of me
- The signal is from there, sir

2206
02:20:52,270 --> 02:20:53,561
Overtake that vehicle

2207
02:20:53,824 --> 02:20:56,033
Both the signals are intersecting, sir

2208
02:21:02,836 --> 02:21:04,087
Check inside

2209
02:21:07,978 --> 02:21:09,103
Take a look, sir

2210
02:21:10,474 --> 02:21:11,932
No one here, sir

2211
02:21:12,047 --> 02:21:12,659
It's empty, sir

2212
02:21:12,684 --> 02:21:13,830
He can never find you

2213
02:21:14,100 --> 02:21:16,100
Another 12 km
you'll be in Telengana

2214
02:21:16,454 --> 02:21:18,588
Someone is making a call to
the minister even now from there

2215
02:21:18,658 --> 02:21:21,325
- What do you mean?
- No one can touch you after that

2216
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:29,492
- Isn't this 40 feet in length?
- Yes, sir

2217
02:21:30,870 --> 02:21:33,081
Govindaraj, get in and
measure the length

2218
02:23:32,492 --> 02:23:33,700
Sir, stop!

2219
02:23:37,664 --> 02:23:38,099
Stop

2220
02:23:39,462 --> 02:23:41,087
- Which city?
- Visakhapatnam

2221
02:23:41,162 --> 02:23:41,977
That is Andhra Pradesh

2222
02:23:42,002 --> 02:23:43,453
This is Telangana
Can't allow you

2223
02:23:43,478 --> 02:23:45,509
A criminal is escaping
I have to catch hi-

2224
02:23:45,534 --> 02:23:46,867
We can handle all that

2225
02:23:47,016 --> 02:23:49,016
His passport has been blocked
How could you let-

2226
02:23:49,041 --> 02:23:50,517
Immigration will handle all that

2227
02:23:58,587 --> 02:23:59,795
This is an emergency

2228
02:24:58,576 --> 02:25:00,035
This is an arrest warrant

2229
02:25:00,250 --> 02:25:02,250
This is the passport
cancellation copy

2230
02:25:02,766 --> 02:25:05,100
Knowing all this, how did you
board him on this flight?

2231
02:25:22,974 --> 02:25:26,219
By now my dad and
chief minister will be in Vizag

2232
02:25:26,244 --> 02:25:29,212
I'll be out in an hour
as soon as we reach

2233
02:25:29,257 --> 02:25:31,132
I'll fly to Australia
in just 1 day

2234
02:25:31,254 --> 02:25:34,171
In a week, 2 containers
will land in India

2235
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:42,234
Both cities from the Indian map will
fall into the sea the very next minute

2236
02:25:42,337 --> 02:25:44,845
Do you think I am
taking you to court?

2237
02:25:44,908 --> 02:25:47,408
We will be soon at the banks
of river Godavari

2238
02:25:47,442 --> 02:25:50,080
The car will lose control
and fall into the river

2239
02:25:50,147 --> 02:25:51,397
40 feet deep

2240
02:25:51,996 --> 02:25:53,662
We will escape

2241
02:25:53,754 --> 02:25:55,380
Bloody mongrel of a criminal!

2242
02:25:55,594 --> 02:25:58,031
You'll drown handcuffed!

2243
02:25:58,192 --> 02:25:59,192
How much longer?

2244
02:25:59,748 --> 02:26:01,082
Speed up

2245
02:26:05,666 --> 02:26:07,166
Faster, drive faster

2246
02:27:11,504 --> 02:27:14,878
Just because you have a gun
will you 'encounter' me?

2247
02:27:15,230 --> 02:27:16,855
What will you do now?

2248
02:27:22,414 --> 02:27:24,039
Knock me down and kill me

2249
02:28:56,600 --> 02:29:00,017
"The lion, king of the jungle
Duraisingam on a mission possible"

2250
02:29:45,624 --> 02:29:47,790
Are you scared to die?

2251
02:29:48,787 --> 02:29:51,587
Didn't I tell you to surrender
giving up this shameless profession?

2252
02:29:52,128 --> 02:29:54,737
You needn't have even got arrested
Just shut down your shady business

2253
02:29:54,859 --> 02:29:58,265
Instead youâve anchored
400 containers of trash in mid sea?

2254
02:29:58,504 --> 02:30:00,087
As if Iâll allow!

2255
02:30:01,497 --> 02:30:03,504
Not only did you kill
32 innocent kids

2256
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:06,295
You planted bombs in police station
and in cars going to and fro

2257
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:08,944
You brag to me, you'll delete
2 cities from the map

2258
02:30:10,193 --> 02:30:12,254
One who blunders
in anger will reform

2259
02:30:12,940 --> 02:30:16,003
One who commits a crime in a position
of authority will never reform

2260
02:30:17,031 --> 02:30:19,462
You dare deride my country
as a trash can?

2261
02:30:19,708 --> 02:30:21,124
You are the trash

2262
02:30:33,878 --> 02:30:36,878
English subtitles by rekhs

2263
02:30:45,909 --> 02:30:49,408
âCentral minister Ram Prasad
has been dismissed from his postâ

2264
02:30:55,601 --> 02:30:57,517
My wedding has been fixed, sir

2265
02:30:58,462 --> 02:31:00,547
I don't intend
sending you an invitation

2266
02:31:00,878 --> 02:31:02,587
Nor insist you attend

2267
02:31:02,874 --> 02:31:05,212
I plan on deleting
your number from my phone

2268
02:31:05,405 --> 02:31:06,003
That's why

2269
02:31:09,852 --> 02:31:11,087
I need to meet you right away

2270
02:31:11,254 --> 02:31:12,103
Where are you?

2271
02:31:12,307 --> 02:31:13,962
I'll be there in an hour, sir

2272
02:31:14,614 --> 02:31:16,962
Another city again, huh?

2273
02:31:26,164 --> 02:31:29,816
"Here comes the lion
The 1 man battalion"

2274
02:31:30,270 --> 02:31:32,186
"Cop and creator re-union"

2275
02:31:33,305 --> 02:31:39,483
