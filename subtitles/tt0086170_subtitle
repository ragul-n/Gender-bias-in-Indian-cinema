1
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,680
Sir...

2
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,680
"Sir, tea..."

3
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,640
Keep it on the table.

4
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Get the draft on Yamaguchi
Company if it is ready.

5
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
- Yes?
- Is the Japanese contract ready?

6
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,840
"Yes, here it is."

7
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,160
I'll get it approved by sir.

8
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,120
"When you type the final, leave
some space between paragraphs."

9
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,760
"Sir, the draft. I'll get the final
copy typed once you approve this."

10
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Your tea is getting cold.
Shall I pour it?

11
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
I'll make it myself.

12
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,240
There seems to be a
mistake in the accounts.

13
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,920
The gain should be 330000
instead of 230000.

14
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,280
All right. I'll take a look.

15
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,760
Please check these figures.

16
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,240
I'll be delayed today.
An urgent meeting.

17
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,040
"- It's 5 o'clock.
- Yes, you may leave."

18
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,640
I'll work a little longer.
Ask the peon to stay back.

19
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,360
"- I'll stay back...
- No, it's not necessary."

20
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,960
Get up.

21
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,400
- I thought I was stuck today.
- Why? - Boss is still working.

22
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,920
- I asked if I must stay.
He said... - What?

23
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Why did you have to say that?

24
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,560
These bosses who employ
pretty secretaries like you...

25
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,560
They have the wrong intentions.

26
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,120
What? He never even
looks up at me!

27
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,200
Never?

28
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,440
Good God! That's
even more dangerous.

29
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,800
- Dangerous?
- Yes.

30
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,760
I've never seen a man
more decent than my boss.

31
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
More decent than me?

32
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,760
You are a vagabond!

33
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,080
You forced a simple girl like
me to come to Bombay from Delhi.

34
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
I asked you to come here
not to pick up a job.

35
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,400
Why won't I work?
What's education for?

36
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,200
Girls like you are enemy
number 1 of the country.

37
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,200
- How come?
- You come from a good family.

38
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,320
You work to while time
not because you need it.

39
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,680
You snatched the job from
one who needed it desperately.

40
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,680
You increased unemployment.

41
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,120
Are you writing a
thesis on this subject?

42
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,960
- Thinking about it. Where to?
- Home.

43
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,960
"Yes, it's the wedding
anniversary of the Banerjees."

44
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
I'd forgotten.

45
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,520
We'll buy flowers
and sweets on the way.

46
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,200
Flowers and sweets?

47
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,280
I give you a lift everyday.
Petrol prices have gone up.

48
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
My pocket is empty.

49
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,520
"- Flowers, sweets...
- Shut up and hurry."

50
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,480
Sat down?

51
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,360
It's our 40th wedding anniversary.

52
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,320
So I'm giving your aunt
40 betel leaves as a gift.

53
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,320
40? Does she like them so much?

54
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,280
Not really. I put her
in the habit for my gain.

55
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,280
What do you mean?

56
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,320
"When we got married, your
aunt liked reddening her lips."

57
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,680
Close your ears.

58
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,920
- Why?
- Close your ears.

59
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,240
Your aunt liked
turning her lips red.

60
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,560
So she would use lipstick.

61
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,240
That lipstick irked my lips.

62
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,200
So I trained her to eat betel leaves.

63
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,200
That would turn her lips red
and I would stand to gain.

64
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,520
What was the joke? Tell me too.

65
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,600
"Nothing. Listen after we're
married, you'll eat betel leaf."

66
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,560
- Why?
- Your lips will remain red.

67
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,080
Even a lipstick can
paint your lips red.

68
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,080
That's the point!

69
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,400
What are you laughing at?

70
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,720
- Nothing.
- Congratulations.

71
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,040
Live long. Sit down.

72
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,000
Sit straight.

73
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,440
Straighten your feet.

74
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,440
Look at how I am respected.
She worships me!

75
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,480
Don't be under false notions.

76
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,880
I pray for myself.

77
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,840
- For yourself?
- Yes.

78
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,120
So I can adorn my hair
with vermilion for 100 years.

79
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,800
Actually I don't photograph
well without vermilion.

80
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,760
We must have a great program.

81
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,760
- Sure.
- Just a minute.

82
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
We'll sing for uncle and aunt.

83
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,120
Why will you sing?

84
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,040
It's our anniversary. We'll sing.

85
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
"- Isn't it, dear?
- Yes."

86
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Isn't the time of pairs.

87
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,000
And...

88
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Banerjee and Rajlaxmi.

89
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,280
My heart trembles when you blush.

90
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,240
Get the harmonium here.

91
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,760
Today's business meeting
was very successful.

92
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,080
I'm confident of getting
the Japanese contract.

93
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,560
That's done it.

94
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,440
Why?

95
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,480
When we married 7 years ago...

96
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,040
...you'd make some excuse
and run home by 3 or 3.30.

97
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,520
Then you started your own
business and returned at 6.

98
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,760
"When it expanded,
you'd return by 8 or 9."

99
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,280
"When it grows even more,
you'll come home by 10."

100
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That's not how it happens.

101
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,480
Dear...

102
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,240
Have you forgotten Nicky went
to her grandma's 3 days ago?

103
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Get up and wash up.

104
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,880
- First give me some tea.
- No. Wash and eat dinner.

105
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,880
Get up.

106
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,280
Open the door.

107
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,840
- I'm changing.
- I just want the brush and paste.

108
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,840
I said I'm changing.

109
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,800
Stretch your hand and give it.
I'll go to Nicky's bathroom.

110
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
I've opened the door.
Take it yourself.

111
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,960
Shall I ask you something?

112
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,480
Will you recognise my photo
if you see it somewhere?

113
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Why? Are you giving
a dance program?

114
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,840
I didn't say that. I asked
if you saw my photo printed...

115
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,880
Will you recognise it?

116
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,160
What? Won't I recognise you?

117
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,480
- I don't think so.
- Why?

118
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,120
"In the morning, before you open
your eyes, you see the paper."

119
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,960
You read 3 papers.

120
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,400
You don't leave the paper
even on the breakfast table.

121
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,400
And these files at night.

122
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,760
I can't recall when
you looked at me.

123
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,400
Do I need eyes to see you?

124
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,880
You need a mind.

125
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
I'm not separate from you.

126
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,840
What are you doing?

127
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,360
Once I called you at work and
you said home talk only at home.

128
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
"Similarly, no office work at home."

129
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,640
- Get it?
- Okay.

130
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,320
Put this away. After all
you're the boss of the house.

131
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,320
"Not just of the house,
when you're home, I'm your boss."

132
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,880
I never objected.

133
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
- Sir?
- How are you?

134
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,960
- Fine. - Where's your master?
- He's gone to his office.

135
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,280
- And madam?
- She's dancing.

136
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,920
"- Shall I call her?
- No, you go. I'll sit here."

137
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,920
- Tea or cold...
- Nothing.

138
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,480
Who is it?

139
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,360
I'm your slave.

140
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,560
Brother Ravi! When did you come?

141
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,480
You thought of us after years!

142
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,240
I came at 3 AM.

143
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,720
The plane landed at 3
Cleared customs at 7.

144
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,080
Slept for awhile and came
straight to you. - Come...

145
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,120
Sit down.

146
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Looks like Ajay's business
is really flourishing.

147
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,720
It's only the business
that's flourishing.

148
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,680
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

149
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
"- Would you...
- No, tell me what it is."

150
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,360
"I said, nothing."

151
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,120
"If it's nothing, why are you
sad talking about his business?"

152
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,640
I'm Ajay's best friend.

153
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,640
You address me as your brother.

154
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
You have to tell me.

155
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,600
What can I say?

156
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,600
"Since he started his business,
he's not worried about the house."

157
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,600
Not of our child or the wife.

158
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Why are you men like this?

159
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
"Before marriage, he
always wanted me."

160
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,000
"After the business, it's
just contracts and files."

161
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,160
Ajay can't be blamed for that.

162
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,240
That's how we Indians are.

163
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,200
We put life in compartments.
Like in a train.

164
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,440
Do this before marriage...
this after the kids are born...

165
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,440
The train has one guard. Here
every compartment has a guard.

166
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,440
"Compared to this,
it was better earlier."

167
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,440
There was some meaning in life.

168
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
I'd be happy knowing
somebody thinks about me.

169
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,440
Life is meaningful.

170
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,080
There's nothing to worry.
I know Ajay very well.

171
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Since childhood. Finding a
man like him is impossible.

172
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,360
"Rest assured, there's nobody
but you in Ajay's heart."

173
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,040
His heart is crushed underneath
the files and typewriters.

174
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,360
You don't worry.
I'll get it out.

175
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,640
I'd like to meet Ajay Sharma.

176
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,080
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

177
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Please state your name and business.

178
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,760
I'll give you my card. Here...

179
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,360
"The name is Ravi Kapoor
and business, personal."

180
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,480
Take a seat there...

181
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm allergic to rexin.
I'll sit here.

182
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,960
You asked for my name.
May I ask yours?

183
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,520
Miss or Mrs?

184
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,920
You want to know if I'm married.

185
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,320
- Yes?
- Give this to sir.

186
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,520
When your name doesn't
give away your marital status...

187
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,360
...why are you curious about me?

188
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,920
A man's face tells whether
he's married or not.

189
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,880
My face probably tells you
that I am a bachelor.

190
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,560
I'm a little confused about you.

191
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,600
You are not wearing
any symbol of marriage.

192
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,880
You are wearing 3 rings.

193
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,840
"You could be either married,
single or a divorcee."

194
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840
You men are very cunning.

195
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,400
It's a man's world.

196
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
"No, what's a man's
world without women?"

197
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,760
What would an egg do without
a hen or a hen with no egg?

198
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,200
What doesn't' man do for woman?

199
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,320
"He slogs for her, makes a house."

200
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,040
"Writes poetry. If she's
alive, he makes her statues."

201
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
"And after she dies, he
builds her a Taj Mahal."

202
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,680
When did you arrive?
Why didn't you come in?

203
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,040
Sit down.

204
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,360
Did you already know her?

205
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,120
"- No, I just met her.
- And went from Anita to Nitu?"

206
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,280
"Son, this should be done at first go."

207
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,440
Mr. Kapoor said you called me.

208
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Yes... read this letter.

209
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
We should give a stern reply
to the point in paragraph 3.

210
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,360
- Excuse me?
- You're beautiful.

211
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
What are you saying?

212
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,400
I mean you're mind is beautiful.

213
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,880
That is why I respect you.

214
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,840
Quickly draft a reply to the letter.

215
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,320
I'm dead!

216
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,640
"I'll explain. This walnut is
tough on the outside, soft within."

217
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,240
That's how women are.

218
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,760
Soft on the inside.
Compassion hides in them.

219
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,400
Man turns away from others' sorrows.

220
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,720
But woman can't stay
without showing mercy.

221
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,680
Hence you must touch her.

222
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,680
What... are you saying?

223
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,920
You don't get it. Not her body
but her heart. Touch her mind.

224
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,800
Yes... all right. But how?

225
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,600
I'll give you an example.

226
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,080
"Did you see the movie;
Pati, Patni or Woh?"

227
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,080
- No.
- I did.

228
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
It's the same situation.

229
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,080
Boss and Secretary.

230
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,480
Like you the boss is married.

231
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,840
"And the Secretary is just
like Nitu, I mean Anita."

232
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,080
Simple and innocent.

233
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,520
The boss wanted to trap the
secretary. So what did he do?

234
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
He created sympathy.
By touching her heart.

235
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,440
My wife became an invalid
a year after our marriage.

236
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,000
There's nobody to look after me.

237
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
I'm very lonely. That's it!

238
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The Secretary got conned.
She started washing his clothes.

239
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,640
- What happened later?
- We'll discuss that later.

240
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,320
First you get started.

241
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,960
How can I? Suppose
Anita has seen that film?

242
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,400
Find out if she's seen it.
Or we'll find another way.

243
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,280
Suppose she hasn't seen the
film but finds out later...

244
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,200
I'll have to spoon feed
you like a little kid!

245
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,320
Man should translate
every defeat into victory.

246
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,320
"Suppose you get caught,
first laugh out loud."

247
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,720
Then say...

248
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,960
I lost... I lost Rs. 5000.

249
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,640
Rs. 5000!

250
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,320
Yes. Today I might as
well tell you the truth.

251
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,920
One day I went to see a
Hindi film with a friend.

252
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,000
"In the movie, the boss
tells the secretary..."

253
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,000
My wife became an invalid
a year after our marriage.

254
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,280
I am lonely. I have nobody.

255
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,360
Hearing this the Secretary
falls in love with him.

256
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,760
"I told my friend this happens
only in movies, not in real life."

257
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,200
"He said, No. In real life
too women are equally foolish."

258
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,200
"I said, that's rubbish.
He said, no it's true."

259
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,880
I said impossible.

260
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,200
He wagered a bet for 5000. I agreed.

261
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,760
I accepted that bet...

262
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,800
...only because I
trusted your intelligence.

263
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,800
But you turned out to be
a typical Hindi film heroine!

264
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,480
And got taken in by my words.

265
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,080
I believed in you
and lost Rs. 5000!

266
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
And you... are glaring at me!

267
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,320
Please take a seat.

268
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,680
Shall I make a request?

269
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,480
- Yes.
- No... forget it.

270
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,360
"Tell me, sir."

271
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,320
It won't be right.

272
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,320
What's wrong?

273
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,880
I didn't feel like getting up.
Will you make me some tea?

274
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,880
You don't have to request me.

275
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,800
Haven't seen a film for many days.

276
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,480
Can you suggest one?

277
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,560
I saw The Black Stallion.
It's a lovely film.

278
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,440
Not an English film.
I meant a Hindi film.

279
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,760
I hear there's a Hindi film...

280
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,800
What's the name?

281
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,440
"Excuse me, Sir. In 7 years
I've seen just 1 Hindi film."

282
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,440
And that is Mughale-Azam.

283
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Never see Hindi films.
What do you see in them?

284
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
The censor board is always sleeping.

285
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,200
You are beautiful because
you don't watch Hindi films.

286
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,640
I mean your heart is so fresh.
Your mind is so beautiful.

287
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,200
Promise me that you'll
never view Hindi films.

288
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,600
I don't like them.
I love dramas and music.

289
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Tea is not brewed well.

290
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,280
It's good when somebody
makes it for you.

291
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,560
Then it tastes sweet
even if there's no sugar.

292
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,200
Do you know...

293
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,200
It's after 6 years...

294
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,520
...that somebody made me tea
with such affection and love.

295
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,000
Excuse me... I shouldn't be
asking but why is that?

296
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,920
At home...

297
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Forget it.

298
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,480
Personal pain is not to
be discussed in the office.

299
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,920
"Sir, we work together."

300
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,800
You're the head of the family.
We're like family members.

301
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,760
"If it's too personal, forget it."

302
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,520
I don't mind...
No point hiding from you.,

303
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,080
I've been married a year.

304
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,360
And 7 years after marriage...

305
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,960
You're married for 7 years
and a year after marriage...

306
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
"Exactly. I'm married for
7 years, a year after that..."

307
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,800
What happened a year later?

308
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,960
Forget it.

309
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,280
"Why do you keep saying, forget it?"

310
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,280
Just a year after marriage...

311
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,640
My wife...

312
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,760
She got paralyzed.

313
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,240
"If I had any idea of this,
I wouldn't have raised it."

314
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,240
Why are you feeling sorry?

315
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,200
God does not bless
everyone with everything.

316
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,800
The poor thing can't
even get up from bed.

317
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,800
How can she make tea?

318
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,000
Today I understand why
you're always buried in work.

319
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,600
To overcome the loneliness.

320
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,920
Some drink...

321
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,920
Some write poetry.

322
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,560
I... I work.

323
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,560
"Sir, let me make this clear.
Now I'll make tea for you."

324
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,280
So you mustered courage and told her?

325
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,520
Yes sir. Killed the cat the
second time if not the first.

326
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,520
The way I acted... your
film hero would blush.

327
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,000
What did the girl say?

328
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,480
First get me a cup of tea.

329
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,440
Get half a cup of tea.

330
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,480
- Yes sir.
- What did she say?

331
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,560
She said... get some biscuits too.

332
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,680
You're acting pricey!

333
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,960
- Get some biscuits too.
- Yes sir. - What did she say?

334
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,360
- Nitu said...
- Who?

335
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
Anita said...

336
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,600
Tea is wonderful.

337
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,440
Specially with biscuits.

338
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,560
Cancel the tea and biscuits.

339
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,560
Don't get angry. I'll tell you.

340
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
"Ramu, get both.
I'm telling you."

341
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,360
Her eyes filled up at my story.

342
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,520
"She said, Sir, henceforth
I'll make you tea everyday."

343
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,520
Bravo!

344
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,480
Now the next step.
Change the atmosphere.

345
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,480
Take her out of the office.

346
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,280
To her favourite places.

347
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,800
"Feed her good food, give her
the present she desires."

348
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,360
What are you doing?

349
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,680
I'm thinking not doing.

350
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,360
- What?
- Must keep an eye on the hero.

351
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,160
- What hero?
- Hero of my drama.

352
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,640
I'm producing a
multi-starrer comedy.

353
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,320
The hero and heroine
of my play are old.

354
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,160
I want to change them.

355
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,320
I want to bring passion
back to their marriage.

356
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,040
Bring back their past.

357
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,600
The plot of my drama
is slightly Americanized.

358
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,360
This hero goes there and
that heroine comes here.

359
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,600
Now that hero is here
as well as there.

360
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,000
So he has a fight with her
and she fights with him and her.

361
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,200
And he's not fighting
with her but with her...

362
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
That fight comes here
and it adds up...

363
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,280
Your comedy appears more suspense.

364
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,520
Exactly. After the
first and second acts...

365
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,480
People will wonder
about what's happening.

366
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,120
They won't understand anything.

367
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,440
But when the curtain draws
open for the third act...

368
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,440
People will understand
everything is for their good.

369
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,080
Do you have a camera?

370
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,760
- Yes.
- A good camera?

371
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,200
- Yes.
- Bring it.

372
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,080
- Why?
- To click the hero and heroine.

373
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,400
I have to use the photo
in the third act of the play.

374
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,360
- Use?
- Yes.

375
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,880
I have to use it.

376
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,120
You don't understand? Don't try.

377
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,320
You get the camera
and a cup of tea.

378
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,440
You make great tea.

379
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,240
Forgive me for calling you Nitu.

380
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
- You're not offended?
- It's the right thing to do.

381
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,240
"If you don't do so in future,
I'll feel offended."

382
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,120
"So tell me, when is your birthday?"

383
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,120
That was about 3 months ago.

384
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,440
What? Your birthday is gone
and you never told me!

385
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,680
It's nothing special.

386
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,640
A birthday takes you
a year closer to old age.

387
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,680
You crack good jokes.

388
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,640
"What do they say,
better late than healthy."

389
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,120
"In English, they say..."

390
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,120
Better late than never.

391
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,280
"Yes, that's what I said."

392
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,600
- Then come along.
- Where to?

393
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,560
"Anywhere. Come on, get up."

394
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,560
- Select a dress.
- For whom?

395
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,840
Anybody. Select it.

396
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,200
Sir what age?

397
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,480
Age... about 22 or 24.

398
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,800
She's pretty. Slim. Large eyes.

399
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,720
What do you think of this?

400
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,120
This?

401
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,680
No. What do you think
of the yellow one?

402
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,200
I's quite nice.

403
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,680
"Excuse me, is this dress her size?"

404
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,360
- Yes.
- Pack it.

405
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,640
"- Sir, what are you doing?
- Don't address me as sir."

406
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,640
You are like my family member.

407
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,080
Don't I have any right over you?

408
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,920
You go and sit. I'll get it.

409
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,920
- Excuse me...
- Yes?

410
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,320
Do you have more of these dresses?

411
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,240
- Yes.
- I mean taller by 3 or 4 inches.

412
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,320
- Sure.
- Pack it.

413
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,120
Pack it separately.

414
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,480
I'll collect it later.

415
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,400
You? How come you're so early?

416
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,400
- Strike in the office?
- No. Turn around.

417
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,400
- Why?
- Turn around!

418
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,440
These days you argue a lot.

419
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,720
Shut your eyes.
I'll show you something.

420
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,720
Shut my eyes and see?

421
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,040
Just do as I say.

422
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,360
I've shut my eyes. Now
shall I shut my ears to hear?

423
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,760
Now open your eyes.

424
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,680
No fever.

425
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,920
Are you feeling all right?

426
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,360
Pulling my leg?

427
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,240
Come here. I too have a heart.

428
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,800
It's beating after very long.

429
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Do I wear such clothes now?

430
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,680
What's wrong? Wear it.

431
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,840
- Where are you going?
- To wear this.

432
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,440
- Wear it here.
- In front of you?

433
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,840
So what? I'm your husband.

434
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,800
Yes but today his
intentions are askew.

435
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,640
Shall I help you?

436
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,160
Hush.

437
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,120
Listen... nothing.

438
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,480
Nice place.

439
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,760
Yes sir. The couple I stay with...

440
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,840
They always come here.

441
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,880
What do we order?

442
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,400
Anything.

443
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,760
But you must know what's good.

444
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
Vegetable a la Kiev is excellent.

445
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,880
Two vegetable a la Kiev.

446
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,360
I forgot to ask
how is Mrs. Sharma?

447
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,040
Absolutely fine.

448
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,320
I mean all right.

449
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,640
- Why have you brought me here?
- We'll eat here.

450
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,480
Don't you like what I make at home?

451
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,160
One must live life
anew every moment.

452
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,120
This novelty makes life colourful.

453
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
What is food without salt?

454
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,520
And what is life without sparkle?

455
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,480
What is wrong with you?

456
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,080
Two vegetables a la Kiev.

457
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,480
Sit down.

458
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,440
What's the matter?

459
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,880
Nothing.

460
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,080
"If it's nothing, why didn't
you come to see me for a week?"

461
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,880
Lots of work in college.

462
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,800
Is that the truth?

463
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
- Tell you the truth?
- Yes.

464
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,800
I get the feeling...

465
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,240
The pillion seat of my
scooter seems small for you.

466
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,280
"Look, you know me for 4 years."

467
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,360
I can't beat around the bush
nor do I approve of it.

468
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,240
You won't like it put bluntly.

469
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,920
Try it.

470
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,680
Tell me...

471
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,200
A man talks all day in college.

472
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,040
In a city like Bombay by evening...

473
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,320
Drives his scooter at
60 to meet somebody.

474
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,000
And he reaches there to see...

475
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,600
...the one he has come for goes
off in a car with somebody.

476
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,560
How does that feel?
Is that it?

477
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,880
Why don't you just
order me to quit my job?

478
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,560
- Will you quit if I ask you to?
- Yes.

479
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,880
But I will ask you a question.

480
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,200
When will you marry me?

481
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
I can't stay in Bombay
without doing anything.

482
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,840
I have to tell my parents
what I am doing here.

483
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,200
Don't you trust me at all?

484
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,920
Forgive me.

485
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,920
I do trust you but...

486
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,440
When I see you with your boss...

487
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
It pains me...

488
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,960
What do I do? Believe me
he is a very good man.

489
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,320
"When I am with him, I wonder
why I don't have an elder brother."

490
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,720
The poor man is very unhappy.

491
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,040
He has been married for 7 years.

492
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,280
A year later his wife fell sick.

493
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,280
She's still bed-ridden.

494
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,600
- The poor man is so lonely.
- The scoundrel!

495
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,240
- What?
- Not you, I mean your..."

496
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,640
Your elder brother!

497
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,200
Elder brother? Why?

498
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,240
I'd seen a film where the boss
cons his secretary like this.

499
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,600
Call his wife tomorrow itself.

500
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,080
May I speak with Mrs. Sharma?

501
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,080
This is Mrs. Sharma.

502
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,720
Sorry to have bothered you.

503
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,040
How are you feeling?

504
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,040
I am fine. Why?

505
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,000
No... you are panting.
Hence I inquired.

506
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
That's because I was
practicing my dance.

507
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,520
But who are you?

508
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,960
My name is Anita Sood.

509
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,480
I wanted to meet you.

510
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,480
It's very important.

511
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,360
May I come over?

512
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,960
"Yes, come over."

513
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,720
Please come in.

514
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

515
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,600
- Are you Mrs. Sharma?
- Yes.

516
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,280
I am Anita Sood.

517
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,680
Come in.

518
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,640
Sit down.

519
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,600
What's the matter?

520
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,200
I am Mr. Sharma's secretary.

521
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,200
I've come to complain
about your husband.

522
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,200
What complain?

523
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,200
Thank God there's somebody in this
world complaining about my husband.

524
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,800
I've been working with him for a year.

525
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,840
But I never felt this way before.

526
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,640
The way your husband has treated
me in the past 15 days or so...

527
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,600
I don't know how to tell you...

528
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,640
What did he do?

529
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,080
He told me you are paralytic.

530
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,080
You can't walk or move.

531
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,120
There's nobody to look after him.

532
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,040
So what did you do?

533
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
I did what a younger sister
would do for her elder brother.

534
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,680
"A little caring, a little sympathy."

535
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,520
Then why are you complaining?

536
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,040
Did he misbehave with you?

537
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,760
No. I am annoyed
with his telling lies.

538
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,320
He lied and took me around.

539
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
He took me to a hotel
and bought me this dress.

540
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,920
Stay here. I'll be back.

541
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,800
- Take a look at this.
- This is...

542
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,840
He took you to National Park?

543
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,440
Yes.

544
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,440
- He took you to Juhu Hotel?
- Yes.

545
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,800
He ordered for
Vegetable a la Kiev?

546
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,440
Yes... do you know all this?

547
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,440
No. But I know my husband.

548
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,680
He was flirting with me not you.

549
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,680
I don't understand.

550
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,400
I'll explain.

551
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,280
Hasn't Miss Anita come?

552
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,120
She'd sent a message that
she'll be an hour late.

553
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,560
Do you understand?

554
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,840
Thanks to you I've
got back my lost 7 years.

555
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,080
Joys have come back to my life.

556
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,520
Go back to work.

557
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,560
And let this continue.
In fact add fire to it.

558
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,200
"No, Mrs. Sharma."

559
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,520
"Look, I know my husband."

560
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,520
He will not misbehave with you.

561
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,800
"If he does, you may slap him."

562
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,400
I won't mind it at all.

563
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,360
So did you find out
how your boss' wife is?

564
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,040
I've found out everything.

565
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,400
All you men are alike!

566
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,040
You'll do the same
to me after marriage!

567
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,400
- First let's get married.
- Married?

568
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,760
Marry a man?

569
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,360
Will you marry a woman?

570
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,680
You'll have to marry a man.

571
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,360
Man? I've wiped man out of my life.

572
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,840
Now I know why man
rhymes with pain.

573
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,320
You men are such cheats!

574
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,080
"What, Anita? Anita is dead!"

575
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,880
But... listen to me...

576
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,280
Excuse me... mister!

577
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,920
Wasn't that Anita?

578
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,280
- Yes.
- But what is she doing here?

579
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,280
She went... why?

580
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,880
Went to her boss'...
New twist in the play.

581
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,640
And who are you?

582
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,840
"I'm Anita's brother and
friend of Ajay, Anita's boss."

583
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,920
And creator of the
drama that's going on.

584
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,120
But how are you related to Anita?

585
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,560
Actually nothing.

586
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,160
"The way she was scolding you,
soon you will be something."

587
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,440
I was going in but
it appears dangerous.

588
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,120
Let's have tea somewhere.

589
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,560
"Here you are, sir."

590
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,520
Tell me...

591
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:57,040
There's a plot of land.
Barren for years...

592
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:03,040
Out of the blue somebody came
and grew flowers in the desolation.

593
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,720
What will we call him?

594
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,680
Gardener.

595
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,000
"Yes, gardener.
You are the gardener of my life."

596
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,520
You watered my life like a gardener.

597
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,680
Fertilised it and grew
bunches of flowers.

598
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,920
Spring came back to my life.

599
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,320
"Sir, you are not aware of
how you've changed my life."

600
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,160
I dream even in the day
not just at night.

601
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,240
Yes.

602
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,200
The only regret is...

603
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,840
Office closes at 5.

604
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,520
I want more.

605
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,600
Let's go out somewhere.

606
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,320
For a long drive.

607
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,840
"Yes. Far, far away."

608
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,520
For a day or two.

609
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,280
Just you and me.

610
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,800
The night will be moonlit.

611
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,800
It will feel as if our car
is flowing in a river of light.

612
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,280
We can't go out for 2-3 days.

613
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,760
What will I say at
home? In the office?

614
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,120
Tell them in the office
you have work at home.

615
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,160
"And at home, say you're
leaving for work. Come on."

616
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,680
"No, you know my wife..."

617
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,000
She doesn't keep well...

618
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,120
- We can't leave her alone...
- I understand.

619
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,320
You don't like being with me anymore.

620
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,640
"Else for the wife who is
unwell for 7 years, suddenly..."

621
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,960
I really want to go.
Please come on.

622
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,240
The Yamaguchi papers have to
be kept ready. Get the file.

623
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,920
The file is right here.

624
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,200
The case is getting confusing.

625
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,080
I'll have to work all night
You might as well leave.

626
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,160
Your tea is cold.
Shall I make you another?

627
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,240
"No, I quite like cold tea."

628
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,960
You may leave.

629
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,440
Good grief!

630
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,920
Wow! Wow!

631
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,920
What a sister! How did
you guess I was hungry?

632
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,880
Have you got this from a shop?

633
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,880
Why would I get it?
I made it with my own hands.

634
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,880
"Of course, people cook with
their hands not their feet."

635
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,880
But for whom is it?

636
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,360
Actually it's for him.

637
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,520
He likes all this.

638
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,800
He likes it. So things
are back to the old times.

639
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,200
- You are...
...very bad?

640
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,840
These days you even
blush like a bride.

641
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,800
- What is wrong with you?
- I'd like to ask the same.

642
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,520
Have the lost years
of marriage returned?

643
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,800
Stop. Put it back.

644
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,360
Put it back.

645
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,680
Now I get it. You are
teaching him these tricks.

646
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,000
- What tricks?
- Flirting with secretary.

647
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,160
That. How else would
that fool know all this?

648
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,000
Terrific! What a great brother.

649
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,040
He's teaching his brother-in-law
how to love other women.

650
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,160
It takes guts to love other women.

651
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,600
Ajay maybe your husband but...

652
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,960
"- He's an ass, coward...
- Look..."

653
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,200
Before fighting tell me...

654
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:55,560
Be honest. Have the old times
of your marriage returned?

655
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,080
Are you as happy as earlier?

656
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,240
- Yes but...
- No buts.

657
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,560
Every ailment has its' cure.
This is the treatment for Ajay.

658
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,560
He'll shower you with the joy
he gets from being with Anita.

659
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,840
Think about this...

660
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,440
How insulted I must feel...

661
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,400
He has to do a rehearsal
to be romantic with me.

662
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,840
With another woman.

663
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,080
Are you feeling jealous?

664
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,920
Obviously.

665
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,040
Jealousy is the root of love.

666
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:37,400
Water and fertilise it.
The tree of love will blossom.

667
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,120
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

668
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,040
Ignite this jealousy in Ajay's heart.

669
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,360
Burn him up and then see
how my scheme shows results.

670
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,360
When Ajay returns tonight...

671
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,880
"Some days ago, there was
an advertisement in the paper."

672
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,120
They needed an MA to
draft letters in English.

673
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,840
I won't accept if
you don't want me to.

674
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,160
But please let me.

675
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,400
I'll be home by 3 everyday.

676
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,400
All right but on one condition.

677
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,280
"You'll never say, look
I'm working, so you cook."

678
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,440
Abuse me if you want.

679
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,680
If it makes her feel good,
she can slap me from there.

680
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,680
But tell me what is my fault.

681
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,640
If she behaves like this,
this is my last birthday. The end.

682
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,920
Did you see that?
This is how they act and fool us girls.

683
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,640
They keep the wife home
like a bank balance.

684
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,600
And the Secretary is pocket
money... All men are alike!

685
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,600
"- Whether they wear khadi, jacket...
- Or a kurta."

686
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,360
"No, uncle is different."

687
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,240
Really if I hadn't seen you...

688
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:02,600
I'd tear up all the dictionaries
where professors write of loyalty.

689
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,960
I'm sure you've done some wrong.

690
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,200
I swear I didn't do anything.
I can swear by aunt.

691
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,840
Don't. She's my only wife.

692
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,440
If you take a false promise...

693
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,800
Is that the truth
you did nothing?

694
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,800
I swear by my job.

695
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,120
He swears by his job. In
today's world that means a lot.

696
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,760
"Yet, apologise to her."

697
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,080
But what have I done?

698
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,880
You must have done something.

699
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,080
That girl is not like my wife
to get angry for no reason.

700
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,880
Your head!

701
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,120
Say you won't repeat it.

702
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,880
- I won't do it.
- I won't tease girls.

703
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,360
- Uncle I...
- Say it.

704
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,360
- I won't tease girls.
- There comes the truth.

705
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,880
You are witness. He owned it.

706
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,040
I said it because uncle said so.

707
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,320
Very good. Now make up.

708
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,320
Wish Jeet on his birthday.

709
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,320
- Did you see that?
- Not like that. Feed him a sweet.

710
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,320
You ass! Not by your own hand.

711
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,760
You feed me.

712
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,680
Hold this. I'll check.

713
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,880
Brother!

714
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,520
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

715
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,160
Is Jeet Saxena here?

716
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,840
"Yes, how do you know him?"

717
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,600
I know him from childhood.

718
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,160
I'm tired of searching for you
and you're having a ball. Sweets.

719
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,800
These are Mr and Mrs. Banerjee.

720
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,160
- Good day. - Come in.
- May you live long.

721
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,720
He's Ravi.

722
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,600
I'll talk to you later.
First let me handle him.

723
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,600
You've got a parcel from Delhi.

724
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,720
Parcel for me from Delhi?
Who sent it?

725
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,760
You're acting innocent.
Who else can send it?

726
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,600
- Rita sent it.
- Who is she?

727
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,480
- But I don't know any...
- Don't do this to anyone.

728
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,040
You are a girl.
You will understand.

729
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,440
If somebody stands with you
on the banks of the Yamuna...

730
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,560
...with the river as witness
pledges to live and die for you.

731
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,000
"And goes away and forgets,
never writes any letters..."

732
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,440
How would you feel? Poor Rita!

733
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,680
"- But you... - No, I don't
mean your love is not true."

734
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,400
You've loved her like the Taj.

735
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,600
Your love is higher
than the Qutub Minar.

736
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,440
More chaste than the mosque.

737
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,920
That is why she's crazy about
you. Keeps sending presents.

738
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,920
And you neither write nor...

739
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,320
Listen...

740
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,320
What have you done!

741
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,880
"What you just said,
is that the truth?"

742
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,880
I never speak the truth.

743
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,880
- May I have one sweet?
- Yes.

744
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,320
Get out of here!

745
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,560
She pushed me so hard!

746
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,400
It's these pushes that
make man an artist.

747
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,800
Have a sweetmeat.

748
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,720
- Where is madam?
- Not back from the office.

749
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,400
All right. You may go.

750
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,160
You're very late.
It's 8 o'clock.

751
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,800
Today for the first time I felt...

752
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,120
...it gives so much joy
to give happiness to another.

753
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,800
I couldn't bear his sorrow.

754
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:57,120
I thought if my presence
can relieve somebody's pain...

755
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,120
What's the harm?

756
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,800
Must be a friend of yours.

757
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,560
"No, my boss."

758
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,760
- Would you like tea?
- To hell with tea. What about boss?

759
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,400
Forget it.

760
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,000
It will sadden you too.

761
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,720
Charan! Get some tea.

762
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,000
I don't' want tea!
What happened to your boss?

763
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,600
Dear God! Nobody must suffer so.

764
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,440
He has everything.

765
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,400
Yet it is nothing.

766
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,920
He has everyone but nobody.

767
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,920
But what is wrong!

768
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,600
Your boss is paralysed?

769
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,360
No. His wife.

770
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,880
It's 7 years since he got married.

771
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,320
"Within a year of marriage,
his wife was paralysed."

772
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,920
Lies! He's a liar! A cheat!

773
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,360
- Nothing has happened to his wife!
- Why are you yelling?

774
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,360
"I'll scream louder because
he's fooling, cheating you!"

775
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,360
Have you no shame talking
about a gentleman in this manner?

776
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,840
I'll shoot that gentleman!

777
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,160
From tomorrow you won't go to work!

778
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,320
All right.

779
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,320
I'll quit if you wish.

780
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,480
But how can I?

781
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,400
"According to the contract,
I have to give a month's notice."

782
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,240
"All right, give the notice tomorrow!"

783
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,000
And from tomorrow I
want you home sharp at 3!

784
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,720
Paralysed!

785
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,040
You?

786
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,640
You're back real early.

787
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,640
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

788
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,960
I see...

789
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,960
You left office for a meeting.

790
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,600
Yes. I had a meeting.

791
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,400
Of course.

792
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,360
I will be sorry.

793
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,960
When I gave him my resignation...

794
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,960
The poor man said...

795
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,600
"Why are you doing this, Nimo?"

796
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,560
What? He called you Nima?

797
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,600
"No, not Nima."

798
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,880
"He asked, what he had done..."

799
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,880
"Nimmy, why are you leaving me?"

800
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,840
In just 2 days he has
became very close to you.

801
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,840
What are you saying?
He's 10 years elder to you!

802
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,520
The poor man is old.

803
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,440
May God help today's young
girls from these old men!

804
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,680
Drink the tea. What
are you thinking of?

805
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,720
"What you did, isn't right."

806
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,360
You don't know Anita.

807
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,200
She won't talk to me all her life!

808
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,320
Professor you've
read a lot of Economics.

809
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,680
But you know nothing of love.

810
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,680
How many times have
you fallen in love?

811
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,680
The only love I had
died a premature death.

812
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,640
Death? What nonsense!

813
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,640
Make Anita jealous. Envious.

814
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,640
What will happen next?
She will get angry.

815
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,600
She will cry.
She'll curse you.

816
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,600
She'll sing a sad song.
And threaten to commit suicide.

817
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,600
Finally truth shall prevail.

818
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:38,920
When she realises
this was all a lie...

819
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,600
She will repent.

820
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,600
And beg you to forgive her.

821
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,600
She'll plead and cry
buckets of tears.

822
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,280
"She'll say, Ajay forgive me."

823
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,040
From where did Ajay come?

824
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,240
Not Ajay. Slight mix-up.

825
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,920
"Anita will say, Jeet forgive me."

826
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,200
- Forgive me!
- Hats off to you.

827
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,480
I think you should open
an institute for romance.

828
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,480
I will but in Poona not Bombay.

829
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,920
You need space for institutes
and that's impossible in Bombay.

830
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,120
I've been offered a huge
plot in Koregaon Park.

831
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,440
"For the time being,
let me end this drama."

832
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,920
Hand yourself over to the writer
and prepare for the next scene.

833
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,840
- You have to meet Nima.
- Who is she?

834
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,400
Here you are.

835
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,920
He is Prof. Jeet Saxena.

836
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,320
- Hello.
- And this is Nima.

837
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,720
Please take a seat.

838
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:54,720
May I call you sister-in-law
like brother Ravi does? - Sure.

839
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,280
- Here...
- Thanks.

840
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,680
"Your tea, brother."

841
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,680
Has this dramatist told you all?

842
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,240
Almost except for the last hunch.

843
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,640
But is that all right?

844
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,200
- I'm a trifle nervous...
- There you go again.

845
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,200
I thought only professors
in India are courageous.

846
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:24,200
"Even after students brandish
knives, you conduct exams."

847
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,640
And this is just acting.

848
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,200
Yes. You have to do this.

849
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,680
Please give it another think.

850
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,640
What for?

851
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,560
You knock sense into him.
I'll call Ajay.

852
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,600
How is Anita?

853
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,040
- She's not talking to me.
- Why?

854
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,720
How would I know?

855
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,400
I know why.

856
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,360
Ravi here.

857
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,520
I've spoken to Girdhari.

858
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,040
It's a party of 30 to 40 lakhs.
Handle with properly.

859
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,440
Why am I screaming?

860
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,480
It's a public telephone.

861
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,480
He'll come to Hotel
Blue Moon at 1.30

862
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,400
At Linking Road.

863
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,960
Why are you repeatedly
looking at your watch?

864
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,920
I... I was thinking...

865
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,280
What watch does your husband wear?

866
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,920
I think HMT. Why?

867
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,240
Had it! Then he won't be late.

868
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,640
Why are you so worried?

869
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,800
Actually I'm always in khadi...

870
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,280
In these clothes I feel like an
Indian leader going on a foreign tour.

871
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,760
It's apt. Leaders too have to act.

872
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,760
And you can't act a little.

873
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,280
And what do you have to do?
Laugh and hold my hand.

874
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,480
No... I will laugh but
not hold your hand.

875
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,080
All right. I'll hold your hand.

876
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,480
- Come in sir.
- Ravi is here.

877
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,720
Sit down.

878
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,200
Remember everything?

879
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,200
Good acting gets you Rs. 100.

880
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,200
Rs. 100? Acting for a day
in films gets you Rs. 100.

881
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,360
I should get at least Rs. 200.

882
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,960
Rs. 200! You doubled your
rate on applying make-up!

883
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,320
A retake is done if
you make a mistake in films.

884
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,640
Here I'll be jailed.

885
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,120
That will be after
you've eaten good food.

886
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,080
He's here!

887
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,960
Sit down.

888
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,520
"This is my dear friend, Ajay Sharma."

889
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,480
Pleased to meet you.

890
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,920
And this is Mr. Motumal.

891
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:15,200
But you said you'll
introduce me to Girdharilal.

892
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,800
Actually his parents
named him Girdharilal.

893
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,960
But close friends use his pet name.

894
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:29,120
"Sir, I can give 100%
guarantee of only Ajay."

895
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,440
That's good. We can sign
a contract for a crore.

896
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,440
- A crore?
- Is that less?

897
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,920
Make it 2 crores.

898
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,000
Why worry when you're involved?

899
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,840
Of course I am between you.

900
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,840
- Have you got the papers?
- Yes.

901
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,840
You guys discuss this.
Excuse me for a while.

902
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,800
What would you like to eat?

903
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,280
- Now you must laugh.
- I can't.

904
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,280
I just can't laugh.

905
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,280
Put your hand up.

906
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:06,240
Does your husband get
violent when he's angry?

907
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:11,680
He doesn't but if you won't laugh
I'll use my hands and legs.

908
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,280
"Come on, laugh!"

909
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,720
You appear very happy.

910
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,040
I've never seen you this happy.

911
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
You've hardly looked at me.

912
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Does my looking matter?

913
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,640
You are young and beautiful.

914
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,000
You must find many to look at you.

915
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,000
What are you saying?

916
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,480
I'm happy because I know
you'll take me to a hotel.

917
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,960
Why? Don't you
like home cooked food?

918
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,960
I used to like but since
you got me used to going out...

919
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,240
Where will we go today?

920
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,360
To Hotel Blue Moon.

921
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,320
Who was with you?

922
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,280
My boss.

923
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,080
I see. How many bosses do you have?

924
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,120
The one in your office
is 10 years older to me.

925
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,160
Another one takes you to lunch.

926
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,760
Talk to me with respect.

927
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,440
I'm a married woman.

928
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,160
I too am a married man.

929
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,520
- Can I ask my wife why she...
- No point in answering this.

930
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,240
You've stopped trusting me.

931
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,400
- What are you saying?
- Don't touch me!

932
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,360
I am a shameless woman!

933
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:25,440
I am a tramp! I'm leaving
this house for good!

934
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,720
Find yourself a chaste woman!

935
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,360
Listen to me...

936
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,000
Come here.

937
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,040
Why have you called me here?

938
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,600
Jeet is coming here.

939
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,240
I don't want to meet him.

940
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,560
He's not coming to meet you.

941
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,200
He's coming to see
Rita Kumar Mangalam.

942
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,320
So let him. I don't care.

943
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,560
"When you don't care, why are
you saying it with such anger?"

944
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,880
"Listen, I heard Jeet
telling Rita on the phone..."

945
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,560
Come to the dry swimming pool
near Ruia Park at 3 o'clock.

946
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:04,040
Wear the peacock coloured
dress in which you look a vision.

947
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,120
That is why I asked you to
wear this peacock coloured dress.

948
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,160
- What does that mean?
- It means...

949
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,480
I called up Rita and told her...

950
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,240
Jeet has asked me to tell you...

951
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,480
Today's appointment is
cancelled for some reason.

952
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:19,720
So?

953
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,720
So Jeet doesn't know the
appointment with Rita is canceled.

954
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:26,920
He will see you in these clothes
and assume you are Rita Mangalam.

955
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,600
Then you can catch him red-handed.

956
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,200
I can't do this.

957
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,120
Then slap him.

958
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,080
- No let me go.
- I won't let you.

959
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,760
It's time for woman
to demand her rights.

960
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,760
It's time to put an end to the
injustice to women through the ages.

961
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:48,040
Meet and ask him why
he was disloyal to you!

962
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,400
Go and sit there.
He must be coming.

963
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,080
I'll hide somewhere.

964
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,440
Go.

965
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,280
- You're here if something
goes wrong... - Yes.

966
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,840
You've come?

967
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:18,440
You look so good in this
peacock coloured dress.

968
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,120
I feel...

969
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,480
I feel like marrying you today!

970
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,760
You're all dressed up.

971
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,120
Yes... just like that...

972
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,000
You must be disappointed to see me.

973
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,320
Why would I be disappointed?
I came to meet you...

974
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,040
- To meet me?
- Absolutely.

975
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,280
Liar! Cheat!

976
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,600
It will hurt me!

977
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,960
- I won't spare you!
- What are you doing?

978
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,760
"Help me, Ravi!"

979
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:10,200
- I won't leave you!
- Help me!

980
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,520
Move aside! The day for woman
to demand her rights has come!

981
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:18,160
For 4 years he pretended to
love me. He ruined my life!

982
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,800
"Listen, you know him for 4 years."

983
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,800
And you know me for only 4 months.

984
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,840
You accepted what I said as truth
and never asked him what was true!

985
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,520
What do you mean?

986
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:32,560
I mean Rita Kumar Mangalam
was born in my drama.

987
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,520
Only to make you jealous.

988
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,800
I didn't expect this from you.

989
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,440
I too didn't expect this from you.

990
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,080
Of what use is the love
that has no trust?

991
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,840
The plant of love only
grows in the soil of trust.

992
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,720
Forget it!

993
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,040
I've been widowed... before marriage!

994
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,800
Don't overact.

995
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,680
Apologise to him.

996
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,520
See? Didn't I say she will cry?

997
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,520
She will curse you and feel hurt...

998
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,920
- Go.
- Shall I?

999
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,920
Drama before marriage.
What will you do after marriage?

1000
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,320
After marriage...

1001
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,920
After marriage...

1002
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,880
"Just like your friend,
Ajay loves his wife."

1003
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:37,280
"If Ajay has loved anyone,
it is only his wife."

1004
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:40,840
You were just an excuse.
And why should you be angry?

1005
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,840
"If anyone has to be
angry, it is Jeet."

1006
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,840
Yes. I'll go to his office.

1007
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:48,480
And I'll give him a box!

1008
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,840
I'm the dramatist not you.

1009
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:56,280
You are puppets.
You will dance to my tune.

1010
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,800
Understand? But you are right.

1011
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,200
You will have to go to Ajay's office.

1012
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,800
But as a detective.

1013
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,800
A private detective.
His name will be...

1014
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,160
- You are?
- Please remain seated.

1015
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,720
My name is...

1016
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,120
Yes?

1017
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,880
I am a detective.

1018
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,560
But why have you come here?

1019
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,080
You've probably heard of ID Sood.

1020
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,040
- No.
- No?

1021
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:02,720
He bashed the skull of
a horse in a fit of rage.

1022
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:07,720
I'm neither interested in boxing
nor do I have a business of horses.

1023
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,480
But Indra Daman Sood...

1024
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,280
...who bashed the skull
of a horse in a punch.

1025
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,920
"You are related to his
daughter, Anita Sood."

1026
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,360
Anita is my private secretary.

1027
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,920
Or private something else?

1028
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,360
What does that mean?

1029
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,600
"I mean Pati, Patni aur Woh."

1030
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,880
"What? Such filthy, lies..."

1031
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,440
Are these pictures
too filthy and false?

1032
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:58,480
No... this is not true.

1033
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:02,840
I mean it is true
but not completely.

1034
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,200
"What it is, is enough
for Indra Daman Sood."

1035
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,120
- In one punch he...
...smashed the skull of a horse.

1036
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,680
There's only one solution
for both of you. Marriage.

1037
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,200
"What are you saying, Dharmender?"

1038
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,680
Dhurandar not Dharmendra.

1039
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:26,920
"Yes, that's it. Why don't
you sit there in comfort?"

1040
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,080
Would you like some tea?

1041
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:34,240
No tea. Now I'll
feast on your wedding.

1042
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,640
How can I get married?

1043
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,280
Divorce your wife.

1044
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,640
- You... - These pictures
will be printed in the papers.

1045
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,600
Large pictures.

1046
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,600
No. Listen...

1047
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:54,560
Yes. You can ask
Anita if it is true.

1048
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,000
I'm sure you know Anita.

1049
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,560
Do I know her?

1050
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,040
I am a godsend for her.

1051
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,280
And the god of death for you.

1052
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,000
He must be getting his blood
pressure checked by a doctor!

1053
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:22,000
Bravo! Now the poor chap
is caught in the web.

1054
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,640
Let's go to Anita.
We have to...

1055
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,320
- What do you mean?
- Look...

1056
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,960
"Why should I tell? If I reveal
all in the first scene, it's no fun."

1057
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:30,640
I won't divulge anything!

1058
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,920
At least tell me where
you imported this name from.

1059
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,920
That's not an imported name.

1060
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,920
It's a completely Indian name
comprising of 40 herbs.

1061
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,560
I read it in a paper.

1062
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:45,640
The moment I read it
it got engraved in my head.

1063
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,640
Is this a name or a cannonball?

1064
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,560
What? What did you say?

1065
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,880
Film posters on a school wall?

1066
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,480
Whose are they? Which film?

1067
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,800
Tear them! Throw them away!

1068
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,440
What? They're stuck so hard
you can't tear them out?

1069
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,760
Knock down the wall!
Do you understand?

1070
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,760
They've already ruined
the youth of the nation.

1071
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,760
Now they've started
sullying the children.

1072
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,040
- What is it? - He was
selling cinema tickets in black.

1073
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:32,200
Cinema tickets and in black!

1074
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,360
Sin and crime at the same time!

1075
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:36,360
Have you no shame
in selling in black?

1076
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,200
First I would feel ashamed.

1077
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:42,640
But since I saw black marketeer
Karodilal become a leader...

1078
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,160
"And won an election,
I now feel no shame."

1079
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,680
Shut up!

1080
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,320
I'll whip your skin off!

1081
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:52,960
"Sir, you speak just like
Amrish Puri and Amjad Khan."

1082
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,960
Who are they?

1083
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,280
- They are great villains.
- What? Am I a villain?

1084
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,640
You are a thief! A cheat!

1085
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,520
I'm no thief or cheat.
I've cleared High School.

1086
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,040
I do this only to survive.

1087
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,200
You can't say this
and win over my sympathy.

1088
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,520
But that is the truth.

1089
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,480
You have no idea of our business.

1090
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,160
Business is down.
Amitabh is unwell.

1091
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,160
And the censor doesn't
let us show sex and violence.

1092
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,120
Hence all films flop.

1093
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:26,200
But now a film has been released
where we can earn something.

1094
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,160
"It contains sex, violence..."

1095
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,440
"Sir, he has chasing
this girl in broad daylight!"

1096
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,440
Quiet! On the roadside?

1097
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,440
"- In broad daylight. - Yes,
and she was running for dear life."

1098
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,080
"- Listen, I...
- Quiet!"

1099
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,400
I know vagabonds like you very well!

1100
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,920
- Listen to me...
- Quiet!

1101
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,160
- But he...
- Quiet!

1102
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,880
I know he must be the
son of a millionaire.

1103
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:00,400
"Whatever that be, the law
doesn't care about anyone."

1104
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:02,960
Are you feeling well?

1105
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,680
That you'll know when you celebrate
the next 6 birthdays in jail!

1106
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:11,920
Aren't you Bindiya?

1107
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,680
Yes.

1108
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,920
And you are Raj Babbar?

1109
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,680
Yes.

1110
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,200
He is Raj Babbar!

1111
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:24,840
"If he's Raj Babbar,
I am the king of beasts!"

1112
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,240
He is the man who
first raped Zeenat Aman...

1113
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:31,920
...and then Padmini Kolhapure.

1114
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,520
What? He rapes two girls
and talks with great pride!

1115
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,200
He has been punished for it.

1116
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,200
Zeenat Aman shot him so hard that...

1117
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:45,160
"If he died, is this his ghost?"

1118
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:49,680
"No, I was referring to
the film, Insaf Ka Tarazu."

1119
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,560
He did all this in that.

1120
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:54,640
Yes. What a film that was!

1121
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:58,120
We sold the five buck tickets
for Rs. 25 in black!

1122
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:02,080
And this is the famous actress...

1123
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,040
We made a lot of money in Golmaal.

1124
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:11,440
Was this a film shooting?

1125
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
"Yes, we were shooting."

1126
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,120
- Was there a camera?
- No.

1127
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,760
There was a camera
but it was in the car.

1128
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,640
- Did you have permission?
- The Production Manager has it.

1129
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,480
Why are you troubling us?

1130
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,480
Troubling? Yes?

1131
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:29,960
You shoot the rape of a girl
on the road and I'm troubling you!

1132
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,600
Watching films people all
over the country commit crimes!

1133
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,280
And we bother you!

1134
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,280
Sorry I'm late.
Here's the permission.

1135
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,400
All right. You may leave.

1136
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,320
Pardon the impudence...

1137
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,880
Why do you blame all the evils
of society on to us film folk?

1138
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,400
When prisoners were blinded
in Bhagalpur jail...

1139
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,480
Was a film responsible?

1140
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,800
"The riots in Aligarh,
Baroda, Meerut..."

1141
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,800
Were they the result of a film?

1142
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,800
"Cement scandals,
illicit liquor is being sold..."

1143
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,800
Are films responsible for them?

1144
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:17,760
Terrific! Sounds like he's
spouting Kadar Khan's dialogues.

1145
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,160
May I say something?

1146
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:22,720
"We have a famous
artist, Utpal Dutt."

1147
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:24,720
He played my father in Golmaal.

1148
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:28,240
You resemble him...
you look like his twin.

1149
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,440
On one hand we have
the great artist...

1150
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:34,720
On the other hand is
this police officer...

1151
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:38,040
You do resemble him.

1152
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,360
- But the brains...
- Quiet!

1153
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,480
But I never imagined
things would go so far.

1154
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,480
- You know...
- The world doesn't know.

1155
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,400
Dhurandar Bhatavdekar doesn't' know.

1156
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,080
"He saw us going out
together, eating at hotels."

1157
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,040
Now where can this tart go?

1158
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,440
Who will marry her?

1159
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,040
"If you wish, shall
I find you a groom..."

1160
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,720
Why don't you take the plunge?

1161
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,680
"Why don't you say,
Yes, I love you."

1162
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:23,000
I will marry you!

1163
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:27,960
But I am already married.

1164
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:29,720
Divorce her.

1165
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,320
You don't know my Papa.

1166
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,320
His honour is more
precious to him than life!

1167
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:38,440
- Once he smashed the skull...
- Of his favourite horse.

1168
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,440
- I know it.
- Do you know why?

1169
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,360
Because he stood second in a race.

1170
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,920
But I have lost the race of life.

1171
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:50,320
Dhurandar Bhatavdekar will
call up for the answer.

1172
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:53,880
"If he answer is no,
you will find my corpse."

1173
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,880
- At this very spot!
- Don't say that.

1174
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:00,320
You've done a lot for me.
Now I have one last request.

1175
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,760
You will perform my last rites!
Cremate me yourself.

1176
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,400
- Come on. - Job done?
- Yes. - Sit in.

1177
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,720
"Brother-in-law!
Sister, look who is here!"

1178
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:36,040
- How are you?
- Fine. Have you come to make up?

1179
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,120
- With whom?
- Sister.

1180
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:42,120
- Where is Nikky?
- Gone to the market with Mom.

1181
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,000
"Tell me the truth,
have you fought?"

1182
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:49,120
Who told you we fought?

1183
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:52,680
"- Then why is sister sad?
- Urmi, who is it?"

1184
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:02,320
- Won't you make me some tea?
- Sure. Of course.

1185
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:13,040
Where are the papers?

1186
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,160
What papers?

1187
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:17,960
Of divorce.

1188
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,520
I'll sign them.

1189
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:23,880
Divorce...

1190
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,880
If you can wait for one day...

1191
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,480
You won't need a divorce.

1192
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,440
- Just another day.
- What do you mean?

1193
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:44,400
How do I tell you... l...

1194
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,400
I'm trapped in my own web and...

1195
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,080
It's all my fault.

1196
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,040
You know my secretary?

1197
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,320
You've fallen for her.

1198
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,680
Fallen in love?

1199
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:07,280
You know I've only loved one girl.

1200
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:09,280
And that is you.

1201
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:15,840
With Anita I only...

1202
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:19,760
I don't know why...

1203
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:23,840
But whatever I did...

1204
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,640
You must not misunderstand me.

1205
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,880
Forgive me if you can.

1206
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,200
I just came to say this.

1207
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,520
Where are you going?

1208
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:49,160
Now there's no point in living.

1209
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,600
Come here.

1210
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,200
Come here.

1211
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,160
Sit here.

1212
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,160
And tell me everything.

1213
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:06,120
I went around with Anita.

1214
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,800
- We ate out...
- I know that.

1215
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,440
You took me to the same places.

1216
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,080
"Believe me, I had no
such relation with Anita."

1217
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:22,080
But a private detective
took pictures of Anita and me.

1218
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,520
And now he is black mailing me.

1219
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,560
Why don't you inform the police?

1220
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:29,560
Tomorrow Dhurandar
Bhatavdekar will call.

1221
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,480
What... what is his name?

1222
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,440
That detective.

1223
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,520
The old man with sparse hair?

1224
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,640
"No, he's quite a young man."

1225
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
There can't be two men with a
name like Dhurandar Bhatavdekar.

1226
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:52,320
Something is fishy.
I'll call uncle.

1227
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:57,800
Nirmala here.

1228
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,400
"Hello, how did you think of me?"

1229
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:05,320
A man has been black mailing
my husband under your name.

1230
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,040
Who? Where is he?

1231
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:10,040
That I don't know but he'll
call my husband tomorrow.

1232
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,280
"What you must do is tell
your husband, when he calls..."

1233
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:17,280
...make an appointment
with him and inform me.

1234
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:20,960
He must not suspect anything.
Leave all else to me.

1235
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,240
My name is Dhurandar Bhatavdekar!

1236
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,240
I've decided to marry Anita.

1237
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:38,720
- What?
- Yes. Like you said...

1238
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:40,840
I will divorce my wife.

1239
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:44,800
Meet me at Wadia Park at 4.

1240
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,120
- What happened?
- Ruined!

1241
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:55,520
He is ready to divorce
his wife and marry Anita.

1242
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:59,120
He's called me to Wadia Park.
Now what happens to me?

1243
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:03,080
This situation isn't in my drama.

1244
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,560
The curtain must drop
before the third act ends.

1245
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:16,200
I'm very scared.

1246
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,200
Could Ajay be plotting some trick?

1247
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:22,520
"Plot? Even if he was in today's
politics, he couldn't plot."

1248
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:28,480
It's 4... l'll check the other
gate. Maybe he's waiting there.

1249
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,040
What's the time?

1250
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:47,360
It's 4 o'clock.

1251
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:50,360
4 You mean 4.20.
That means a cheat.

1252
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,880
You seem to be waiting for someone.

1253
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,080
- Yes.
- For Ajay Sharma?

1254
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,840
- How did you?
- I know.

1255
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,560
Pleased to meet you.
Want to know why?

1256
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,840
Because we're brothers in name.

1257
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:05,840
- Brothers in name?
- Yes!

1258
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,520
My name is also
Dhurendar Bhatavdekar.

1259
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:14,800
- Sir...
- Watch films and become a detective!

1260
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,480
No. I don't watch films!

1261
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,800
Constable! Nab him!

1262
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,240
Where will you escape?

1263
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,280
"Constable, nab him!"

1264
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,960
Where will you escape?

1265
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,040
I'm stuck...

1266
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:48,160
I'm stuck!

1267
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:55,080
"Mother, I mean sister,
your child is real cute."

1268
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:56,720
May I carry him for a minute?

1269
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,080
"- Sure.
- Come here, baby."

1270
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:03,080
Carry on. The home is
so lonely without kids.

1271
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,560
-That is why this park is great for children.
- Absolutely.

1272
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,360
"Sir, excuse me!"

1273
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:13,360
Did you see a dangerous
criminal come this way?

1274
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:16,000
I'll check. Hold the baby.

1275
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Hold the baby! Catch him!

1276
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,360
"Sir, may I read your paper?"

1277
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:36,360
- But it's in Gujarati.
- It will do.

1278
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,720
Quiet!

1279
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,240
What happened?

1280
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:13,160
It's terrible!
The police arrested Jeet.

1281
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,760
- Why? - He was disguised
as Dhurandar Bhatavdekar.

1282
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:18,000
There really is such a man
and he's a police officer!

1283
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,680
- Now what happens?
- What happens?

1284
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:24,160
- We're dead!
- Die later.

1285
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:26,120
We'll have to go to
the police station.

1286
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:29,640
And... you stay at home.

1287
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,800
Nima? This is Anita.

1288
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:47,480
Jeet has been arrested!

1289
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:49,640
Arrested? For what?

1290
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:53,680
He went disguised as Dhurandar
Bhatavdekar to intimidate Ajay.

1291
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,040
The real Dhurandar
Bhatavdekar nabbed him.

1292
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,040
Good grief!

1293
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,040
Was Jeet the duplicate Dhurandar?

1294
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,720
Don't worry. I'll do something.

1295
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:22,400
Nima here.

1296
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,360
"Listen, Jeet..."

1297
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,600
The one Anita loves...

1298
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:30,880
He came disguised as Dhurandar
Bhatavdekar to intimidate you.

1299
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:34,320
"Yes, they got caught
while playing this prank."

1300
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:38,840
Hurry to the Wadia Police
station and bail him out.

1301
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,520
I'd like to meet
the officer in charge.

1302
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,280
Please go in.

1303
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,200
In?

1304
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:15,160
I wish to speak with
the officer in charge.

1305
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,520
You can talk to me.
My name is Dhurandar Bhatavdekar.

1306
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:20,560
Not Wadekar!

1307
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,880
I've come from the
Bandra Mental Asylum.

1308
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:28,120
- Mental Hospital.
- Mental Hospital?

1309
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,120
No! I'm Dr. Kapoor.

1310
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,120
And she is my colleague.

1311
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,760
- Good day. - Good day
to you. How can I help you?

1312
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,800
A dangerous lunatic
escaped from our asylum.

1313
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:45,080
"He's no normal lunatic. He's the
top star, Amitabh of loonies!"

1314
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:49,400
Amitabh Bachchan is mad?
It was bound to happen.

1315
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,720
Acts in movies!

1316
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:00,000
No sir. Professor Pyarelal
was Dharmendra's film.

1317
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,760
Soon he too will be mad.

1318
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:05,920
The Amitabh of lunatics...

1319
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,920
His real name is...

1320
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,360
What name did you say?

1321
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:19,400
This name is even more
powerful than mine.

1322
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:23,880
What a heavy name.
Intense and solid.

1323
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:26,320
Describe him.

1324
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,520
I could describe if
he was in one disguise.

1325
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,280
- Meaning?
- I mean...

1326
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:32,880
One day he went for a film.

1327
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:36,240
After seeing the movie
he got ruined.

1328
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:40,840
"Not him alone, the country
is being ruined by films."

1329
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:44,160
You are right.
After seeing the film...

1330
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,080
He wears disguises
and romances girls.

1331
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:48,800
"He fights, becomes a doctor..."

1332
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:53,400
Or a major. Or a private detective.

1333
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,760
"- Height 5' 10"?
- Mine?"

1334
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:04,800
No of that Prof.
Amrutangshu Shekhar Satyavadi.

1335
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:07,120
"He must be 5 feet 91/2"."

1336
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,160
Does he have a moustache?

1337
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:13,760
No but possibly...
he keeps changing disguises...

1338
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:15,440
Come with me.

1339
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,720
I don't understand one thing.

1340
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,040
- Yes?
- How did he get my name?

1341
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,040
- Pardon?
- He calls himself...

1342
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:27,680
That's a famous name.

1343
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,680
He must have read in the papers.
You've solved so many crimes.

1344
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:34,040
"Your name appears in the
Times of India, Evening News..."

1345
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:36,640
"- In the Mid day, Daily...
- Follow me."

1346
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,320
Is that him?

1347
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:42,080
The moustache is false
but the man is real.

1348
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:44,120
Release him.

1349
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,480
Quite a dangerous lunatic.

1350
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:03,000
- May I take him.
- Right away!

1351
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,960
Take a look at who has come for you.

1352
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:14,960
It's Dr. Mangalam.

1353
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,360
Let's go home.

1354
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:26,600
My beloved!

1355
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,880
My Juliet! Sweetheart!

1356
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:33,880
Address me as dear Dhurandar.

1357
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,480
My Dhurender...

1358
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:37,880
Darling Dhuru...

1359
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:39,520
Darling Dhuru.

1360
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,520
This is a police station.
This is prohibited here.

1361
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:43,360
Take him away.

1362
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:48,840
Let go of her.

1363
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,840
We have to go home.

1364
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,760
My eyes can't deceive me.

1365
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,080
It is you! Yes!

1366
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,720
Damnation! He's obsessed with acting.

1367
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,720
He'll get caught and
get us in trouble too!

1368
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:11,360
"In the three tier,
ripping apart the curtain..."

1369
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:14,720
You were the enemy of Alladin's lamp!

1370
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:18,680
Murder! Murder!

1371
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,680
Leave him.

1372
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:27,360
- Let's go.
- The world won't let you die.

1373
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:30,120
And Dhurandar Bhatavdekar
will not let you live!

1374
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:32,320
- Big Moustache!
- Take him away!

1375
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:37,000
You'll find out when the corpse
dances on the wall of China!

1376
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:41,360
Then you'll know why cigarette
smoking is injurious to health.

1377
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:43,120
Let's go.

1378
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:48,920
How did Vijay Verma come out?

1379
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:51,920
Matters are ruined!

1380
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:54,000
- What happened?
- There'll be riots. - Why?

1381
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:57,280
Both of them love
Dr Kumar Mangalam.

1382
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:03,480
What are you doing here?
And what are you wearing?

1383
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:10,960
Now have you realised this
game is not all that easy.

1384
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,440
Falling in love too isn't easy.

1385
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,800
"One has to walk on thorns,
step over stones!"

1386
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:21,040
I have to embrace Verma
for the sake of my love!

1387
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:25,440
Victory is mine and you will lose!

1388
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:28,120
Do you recall our first meeting?

1389
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:32,400
- I'll kill but not leave her!
- Let go!

1390
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,080
What are you doing?

1391
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:44,360
What does this mean?

1392
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,800
What did I say?

1393
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:50,320
That's a chant of Japanese karate.

1394
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:53,760
You have to say it to
knock a lunatic unconscious.

1395
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:58,000
"Secondly, why did you hit him?"

1396
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:00,680
"If I hadn't hit him,
he would hit him."

1397
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:04,240
"And if he had died, there would
be bloodshed in your police station."

1398
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:08,200
But don't you worry.

1399
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:21,200
Let's run away!

1400
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,160
What a mess! How did
Mr. Banerjee land here?

1401
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,160
- We're dead.
- What's wrong?

1402
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:37,120
"Like criminals breaking out of
jail, all the lunatics escaped."

1403
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:40,120
That is one strange lunatic.

1404
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:44,840
"If he sees us, he'll
strip off all his clothes."

1405
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:46,560
And will dance the disco!

1406
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,760
Stop him outside.

1407
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,040
Stop the man from coming in.

1408
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:56,600
He thinks he is a
retired judge of Calcutta.

1409
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:00,480
"- May we hide?
- Yes, in that room."

1410
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:03,240
"Hurry, come on."

1411
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:07,480
Going inside is prohibited.

1412
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,440
- Why?
- Orders from above.

1413
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,840
I have urgent work. Let me go in.

1414
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:15,440
- I can't help it.
- Why?

1415
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,080
- Orders from above.

1416
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:21,800
- You are?
- I am Ajit Banerjee.

1417
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:24,880
What do you do?

1418
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:28,400
I used to be the judge
in Calcutta High Court.

1419
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:33,120
- What can I do for you?
- First let me in.

1420
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,680
I won't let you in. No sir.

1421
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:38,880
If you try to enter...

1422
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:40,640
You'll be locked up.

1423
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:42,920
- Big moustache!
- Quiet!

1424
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,280
You be quiet! Do you know
who you are talking to?

1425
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:48,600
"No need to know.
Constable, take him."

1426
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,000
Leave him at the hospital.

1427
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:53,720
- To the hospital. Why?
- To the asylum.

1428
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:58,200
- You are mad not me!
- He's taking off his clothes!

1429
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:02,200
- Catch him!
- Let go!

1430
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,200
Just try touching me!

1431
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:07,160
You don't know I'm a judge!

1432
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:12,840
I belong to the time when hundreds
of cops were blown up by bombs!

1433
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,160
Take this madman away!

1434
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,480
You and your department
are mad not me!

1435
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:21,160
- Quiet! Take him away!
- You are mad!

1436
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:25,160
Locking me up won't help...

1437
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:30,800
Don't let him out.

1438
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:33,120
- Hello uncle.
- Dear Nima.

1439
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:36,360
That phony Bhatavdekar
of yours got apprehended.

1440
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:38,040
But he turned out to be loony.

1441
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:41,360
"Loony? Why, he's an intelligent man."

1442
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:43,440
He's a Professor of Economics.

1443
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,400
"No, his name is..."

1444
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
I'm sure you've caught
an fictitious person.

1445
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,320
Did my husband come here?

1446
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:58,640
Many people came here.
A doctor with a lady doctor.

1447
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:02,960
Just a minute. Were they fooling me?

1448
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,400
Where did they go?

1449
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:18,880
We've surrendered
ourselves to the law.

1450
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,880
"Come here, my dear."

1451
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:32,440
All of you in? Why?

1452
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:35,160
We deserve to be locked up.

1453
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,440
How did you get involved?

1454
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:41,280
He's my husband.

1455
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:45,720
Your son-in-law is innocent.

1456
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:49,920
Only I am at fault in this group.

1457
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:58,640
This was a drama.

1458
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:01,160
This naughty fellow was
the author of that drama.

1459
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,160
- No...
- Him.

1460
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:08,600
- All of you may leave but...
- After tea and biscuits.

1461
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:12,640
You are right. After drinking
tea and eating biscuits...

1462
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,160
...all of you may leave but for you.

1463
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:17,640
Why not me?

1464
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:21,040
I want to know where you
got inspiration for this drama.

1465
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:25,240
From the root of all problems.

1466
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:28,280
Films. I'd seen a film.

1467
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:32,520
The boss uses falsehood
to romance his secretary.

1468
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:36,000
- And fools his wife.
- An illegal romance?

1469
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:38,480
Such films are made in our country?

1470
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,840
Only these kind of films are made.

1471
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,920
What film was it?

1472
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:45,920
Who made it?

1473
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:47,880
B. R. Chopra.

1474
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:53,440
Arrest B. R. Chopra.
