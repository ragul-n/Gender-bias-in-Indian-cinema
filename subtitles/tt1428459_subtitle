00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:23,518
''There's sleep in my eyes.
There're dreams in my sleep.''

2
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,256
''The dreams speak of you and me.''

3
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:33,699
''The words are playrfl.
Playrfl are the promises.''

4
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:38,260
''The promises are our memories.''

5
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:44,002
''Now these promises
shall never break.''

6
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:47,278
''Now the promise of love that....''

7
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:50,805
''...we made through our
eyes shall never break.''

8
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:55,479
''Love is always a little silly.''

9
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:00,883
''lt creates magic through the eyes.''

10
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:05,487
''Love is always a little silly.
- Love is always a little silly.''

11
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:11,461
''lt creates magic through the eyes.

12
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:37,054
''l wouldn't even share
your shadow with someone.''

13
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,333
''You reside in my eyes
in place of kohl.''

14
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,336
''lt doesn't matter from...''

15
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:47,339
''...where the sun rises and
where it sets in the world.''

16
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:52,468
''But my morning
doesn't arrive without you.''

17
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:57,640
''Lying on your shoulders...''

18
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:02,654
''...l find a place close to heaven.''

19
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:09,352
''No complaints from God now, let's
shorten the distance between us.''

20
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,981
She's a wicked witch.

21
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:41,491
Hi! Sorry...
l left the shoot half way...

22
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,120
You're late!

23
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,489
Papa...Why are you always late?

24
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,696
Thank God you came...

25
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:50,935
...if you hadn't she would have
locked herself in the bathroom...

26
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:53,096
Don't tell me l missed her!

27
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,131
We are saved...So are you...

28
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,007

Ohhh...what poor things

30
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:02,746
The spell she casts on
them is a terrible one!

31
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,475
She steals their hearts away

32
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:07,815
Without a heart you can't love.

33
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:11,419
And without love there would be no...

34
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:13,550
No...

35
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:16,153
No...

36
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:24,501
No...

37
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:29,541

Will you meet my children?

64
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:05,021
Your children?

65
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,058
Are you sure?

66
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,171
lt's been three years
since l divorced Maya...

67
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:15,799
The kids are old enough now...

68
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,335
l thought you could become
friends with them and then...

69
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:26,710
Why do you want me
to meet your kids?

70
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:31,047
Because...

71
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:32,852
Go on say it!!

72
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:36,855
You never say it.

73
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:40,664
l know you are the strong...
silent types...

74
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,665
But it feels nice to hear it...

75
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,003
Fine l'll say it...

76
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:48,832
l...

77
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:50,700
Don't say it...

78
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,707
lt goes away...
and l don't want you to go away.

79
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:00,377
Here's your magic wand

80
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:04,816
Mummy...Can l grant wishes
with my magic wand?

81
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:08,724
Just wave it three times like this
and all the wishes will come true...

82
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:11,789
Mom...Do you want anything?

83
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,929
l don't want
anything...l got my wish...

84
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,102
You...What else do l need?

85
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:22,197
Mom...Please tell me again...
How was l born?

86
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,808
Hmmm...ok

87
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:29,208
l was very alone that
night at the hospital

88
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,980
Papa was not there...
he was stuck in a traffic jam...

89
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:33,913
lt was raining heavily...

90
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:37,683
There was no one with
me...Not even the nurse...

91
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,121
Were you scared?

92
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:40,749
Yes...very...

93
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,757
But in just a few moments
all my fears vanished...

94
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:46,292
Because you arrived

95
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,699
And after that l have
never felt scared...

96
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,702
...because you are always with me...

97
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,029
Mom...Even l don't get scared
because you are always with me...

98
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:58,139
But that's what Mamas do...
they are always with their children...

99
00:09:58,311 --> 00:09:59,437
Always & forever?

100
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:01,077

You ruined the whole party...

152
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:21,208
Aleya Please...
She's your dad's guest...

153
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,338
You shouldn't speak
to her like that...

154
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:29,145
Where is the wash room

155
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:32,515
lt's upstairs.

156
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,353
Now how will we have a
party without the cake?

157
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:38,521
You are absolutely right buddy.

158
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:40,190
There's no party without the cake...

Well actually think about it!!

They couldn't have had a
more entertaining party...

167
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:19,696
Yeah right!!

168
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,698
Shreya the clown!

169
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:23,965
l wanted to be their friend...

170
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:25,237
And now l am the wicked witch!!

171
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:27,444
l'd really thought we'd get on!

172
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:30,042
Slowly they'll become friends...

173
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:33,042
lt's ok!

174
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:44,053
Aleya.

175
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:46,055
Aleya!

176
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:49,726
Where did Aleya go?

177
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,672
She saw Aman and me together...

178
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:56,432
Together?

179
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:02,380

Aleya...Listen to me...

Why should l listen to you?

184
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:13,056
Why did you get her here?

185
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,093
You didn't even think
about what we'd feel...

186
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:17,288
What Mama would feel...
- l did think...

187
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:19,762
lf you did you
wouldn't get her here...

188
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:21,090
You're such a liar

189
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:23,293
Aleya!! Aleya!

190
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:30,773
Aleya.
- Aleya.

191
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:40,115
You're ok darling?
- Yeah.

192
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,244
Are you hurt
- no

193
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:43,112
Aleya
- Sure?

194
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:45,717
Are you ok?
- Are you ok?

195
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:48,126
Are you ok?
- You're ok?

196
00:15:48,194 --> 00:15:49,252
He's my Papa...

197
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:50,486
Go away!!

198
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:52,221
Stop it!

199
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:55,665
Can't you see? You were going to
kill yourself and your Papa...

200
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:56,793
Don't you dare!

201
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,534
You can't talk like
that to my daughter...

202
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,602
lf you had stayed away none
of this would have happened...

203
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:05,608
You have every right
to lead your own life...

204
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:09,205
But please keep it
away from our home...

205
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:12,441
Don't try to involve
her into our life...

206
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,300
The birth of the...

207
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:38,469
Mama...Just see my painting...
lt's the wicked witch!

208
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:40,305
Ohhhhhh...

209
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,108
Was that Papa's girlfriend?

210
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,480
No...Papa has no
girlfriend...He is my Papa...

211
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,714
Then why did he get her home?

212
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,719
l promise it won't happen again.
Ok.

213
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:57,288
Why don't you do something?

214
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:59,126
She will take Papa away from us...

215
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:02,131
She can't do
that...Mama won't allow it...

216
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:03,526
Just shut up!!

217
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:05,194
Why don't you understand?

218
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:06,738
Mama and Papa have divorced...

219
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,502
That means Papa can marry Anyone...
Even her...

220
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:16,877
Mama...What if she comes here?

221
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:21,142
We will throw water on her...

222
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:23,779
Witches melt in water...Remember?

223
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:26,150
That's why they don't even bathe...

224
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:39,236
Monsters...They were monsters
in children's disguise...

225
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,329
Really. What does Aman say?

226
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:43,172
He says everything
will be alright...

227
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:44,834
He wants us to meet
again after a few days...

228
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:47,208
Said we should try again

229
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:48,774
But you know what zoobie!!

230
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:50,211
l don't want to meet them...

231
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:52,408
l just never want to see
them again.

232
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:55,219
Shreya...never say never

233
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:57,917

236
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:19,403
l should have never said never!

237
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:28,686
You? Papa was meant to fetch us...

238
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:30,755
He had to go for an urgent shoot...

239
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:32,290
...and your Mom's phone
is not reachable...

240
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:35,293

241
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:37,487
Too bad.

242
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:38,654
Right now it's just me here...

243
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,289

247
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:59,618

248
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,977
We are supposed to stay with you...

249
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:03,346

250
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:05,989
Aleya darling...

257
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:21,538

Look l am really sorry!

293
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:38,894
Ever since we have met
things have been going wrong...

294
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:42,531
When l said l didn't
want to be your Mom...

295
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:45,201

296

Never!

299
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:55,144
You should never say never!

Shut up Anjali!!

316
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:05,813
Hello, mamma. Where are you?

00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:10,619
On that cloud there's a table...

338
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:15,986
And on that table

You'll see...

342
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:25,629
When the cloud floats

00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:28,730

344
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:32,670

Everyone has to work...

362

My job is to make breakfast...

363
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:58,922
...and yours is to keep

No one can take you
guys away from me...

496
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:34,361
My photoshoot was delayed
so l couldn't come...

Yes...You should have...

501
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:54,684
How could you leave
our kids with her?

502
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:56,651
What does she know about kids?

503
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:00,428
She behaves like one herself...
How will she take care of mine?

504
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:02,457
Our kids...

505
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:06,966

00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:08,904
Yes...But nothing happened...

507
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:11,865

So was l but she didn't do
any of this deliberately...

509
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:17,075
lt was a mistake...
for god sake maya!

510
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:20,775
Maybe!!

511
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:23,377
But l'm not going to
allow it again...

512
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:24,713
l am going to see a lawyer!

513
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:27,618
Stop this maya!

514
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:29,357
We had promised each other...

515
00:37:29,427 --> 00:37:31,554
We had made other promises
to each other too, Aman...

516
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,954
Don't take my anger out on him...

517
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:35,090
Shreya just stay out of this!

518
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:36,856
This is not easy for both of us...

519
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:39,401
So let me make it easy...

520
00:37:40,972 --> 00:37:42,371
l'll get an order from
the court tomorrow...

521
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,807
...that my children can
never be with her alone...

522
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:48,444
Then there will be no problem...

523
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,038
ls that ok?

524
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:53,775

525
00:37:56,654 --> 00:37:57,712
Aman...

00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:58,915
lt's ok...You won't get it...

527
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:00,649

528
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:01,919
l'll meet you at home...

529
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:03,585
Maya.

530
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:07,663
Don't go to the lawyers...

531
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:12,833
Think about the kids...

532
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:15,472
That's who l'm thinking about...

533
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,136
But not just about them...

534
00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:22,772
You know nothing's
gonna happen to them...

535
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,671
This is about Shreya ! lsn't it?

536
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,440
l don't care about her.

537
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:34,115
l love her Maya!

538
00:38:35,426 --> 00:38:36,688
l don't want to lose her...

539
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:39,954
Nor the kids

540
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:45,798
Nothing will happen to them...

541
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:52,437
When we couldn't make things work...

542
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,606
...why do you think its
going to work out with her?

543
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:02,877
l don't know...

544
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:06,050
But l want to try...

545
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:11,186
Please.

546
00:39:20,138 --> 00:39:24,199
Without my supervision or permission
she cannot meet the kids...

547
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:30,939
Thank you

548
00:39:46,497 --> 00:39:47,555
Aleya.

549
00:40:11,255 --> 00:40:13,246
Why did Papa leave us?

550
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:17,155
We used to fight a lot...

551
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:22,692
On the smallest of things...

552
00:40:24,535 --> 00:40:25,968
Why did you fight with him?

553
00:40:28,272 --> 00:40:30,672
Sometimes adults are complicated...

554
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:38,273
They can love someone a lot and yet
find it tough to live with them...

555
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:42,277
l'm never going to marry...

556
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:46,150
Of course you will...

557
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:49,017
And you will have a
grand lndian wedding...

558
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:52,088
Garlands...Processions...

559
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:56,295
And l will henna your hands myself...

560
00:40:57,301 --> 00:40:59,633
You will be the most
beautiful bride in the world!

561
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:10,641
What if Papa loves
Shreya more than us?

562
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:15,745
That will never happen...

563
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:19,954
Papa and l will
always be there for you.

564
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:23,018
l hate her.

565
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:25,327
And l love you mama!

566
00:41:32,603 --> 00:41:33,661
Hi!!

567
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:39,200
So...

568
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:41,344
...Will you tell me what happened?

569
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:42,804
Everything's been sorted out...

570
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:44,976
Let's talk about something else.
Yeah?

571
00:41:46,884 --> 00:41:48,078
The way she spoke to me...

572
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:49,210
lt was just ridiculous...

573
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:54,856
Everything was going well...
Anjali and l had hit it off...

574
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,829
Then this thing...
l promise you next time...

575
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:00,056
l won't let them out of my sight!!

576
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:02,832
Shreya...There's going
to be no next time...

577
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:04,632
You have to stay away
from the kids!

578
00:42:05,036 --> 00:42:06,628
l have promised Maya that...

579
00:42:06,704 --> 00:42:09,172
...you won't go near the
kids without her permission...

580
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,698
That's unfair!

581
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:13,075
l know l made a mistake.

582
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:17,842
But Aman my life is incomplete
without you and yours without them...

583
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:19,307
How is this going to work Aman?

584
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:20,714
We don't have a choice Shreya!

585
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:23,953
Let Maya handle the kids...

586
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:26,387
She knows about the
kids...She's a good mom!

587
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:28,849
And l'm not...

588
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,719
l'm not a mother so
l don't know anything, right?

589
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:34,161
That's not what l meant Shreya...
And stop putting words in my mouth!

590
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,663
lf both of you give
different advices to the kids...

591
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:39,225
...they will be confused...

592
00:42:39,337 --> 00:42:40,702
And that's not good for the kids...

593
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:43,799
Just let Maya handle the
kids and you stay out of it.

594
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:46,406
Then what are you doing with me?

595
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:49,411
This is not good for
the kids either...

596
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:51,342
Why don't you go back to them?

597
00:42:52,683 --> 00:42:53,741
That's not what l meant!

598
00:42:53,918 --> 00:42:54,976
But that's the truth...

599
00:42:55,786 --> 00:42:56,946
Why don't you go back?

600
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,048
l am out of here Aman!

601
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:02,158
Stop making a scene Shreya!

602
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:03,690
l need time to think!

603
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:19,106
Will l be alright, doctor?

604
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:22,303
l'm doing everything
you asked me to...

605
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,348
Medicines...diet...everything!

606
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:26,146
l am really sorry Maya...

607
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:28,751
You have cervical cancer...

608
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,159
So...so...now...
will l have to be operated?

609
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:45,193
No...

610
00:43:46,871 --> 00:43:48,771
You have to start radiotherapy...

611
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,216
Maya...l think you
should tell Aman now...

612
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:10,021
Am l going to die, doctor?

613
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:18,129
No...You're going to
live as long as you can.

614
00:44:20,905 --> 00:44:26,775
Just learn to count your life
in moments instead of years...

615
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:58,803
Mama!!!

616
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:02,068
Mama!!!

617
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:08,469
Come on...

618
00:46:08,546 --> 00:46:10,241
Ankush don't forget your
water bottle in school...

619
00:46:10,314 --> 00:46:12,179
Aleya your book that
you misplaced...

620
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:13,546
l have put it in your bag...
- ok thank you!

621
00:46:13,617 --> 00:46:15,881
Anjali...Don't do that
to your tie please!!

622
00:46:16,187 --> 00:46:19,281
lt'll get soiled...

623
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:21,415
Here we go!! Bye guys.

624
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:23,891
Bye mama!
- Bye

625
00:46:23,961 --> 00:46:25,155
Bye!

626
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:26,958
Bye!!

627
00:47:43,974 --> 00:47:45,965
l don't want to die!

628
00:47:46,243 --> 00:47:48,507
l don't want to die!

629
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:04,654
l have been consulting a doctor!!

630
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:10,324
l have cancer!

631
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:13,466
The kids will need you!

632
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,078
l'm coming back...

633
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,348
What about Shreya?

634
00:48:34,425 --> 00:48:36,017
That's not important!

635
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:43,759
Don't tell her...

636
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:45,426
Please!!

637
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,428
l won't...

638
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,466
True promise?

639
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:10,117
Aman!!

640
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,060
You have come!!

641
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:23,062
l shouldn't have
left you like that...

642
00:49:25,075 --> 00:49:26,133
l am so stupid!

643
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:28,544
l missed you so much Aman!

644
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:32,139
l love you.

645
00:49:33,217 --> 00:49:34,411
Shouldn't have said that!

646
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:39,086
Shreya l'm going back...

647
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:42,759
To live with Maya and the kids...

648
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:48,257
Aman...l said l am sorry.

649
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:52,225
l will never do it again...Never...

650
00:49:52,636 --> 00:49:54,536
l won't interfere with the kids...

651
00:49:55,105 --> 00:49:56,265
l swear Aman...really

652
00:49:57,441 --> 00:49:58,499
l am sorry Shreya

653
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:06,173
Aman!!

654
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,774
Aman you can't do this to me!!

655
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:10,518
Aman! Aman!!

656
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:21,188
And they lived

657
00:50:21,265 --> 00:50:23,597
happily ever after

658
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:26,125
Like us, Papa?

659
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:31,135
Yes my darling!!

660
00:50:31,575 --> 00:50:33,133
Just like us...

661
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,241
''A new day arrived today again.''

662
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:42,550
''There are new desires again.''

663
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:49,482
''There is a renewed love.''

664
00:50:51,762 --> 00:50:55,163
''ln the remote corners of the heart.''

665
00:50:57,835 --> 00:51:00,167
''Hidden desires.''

666
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:06,705
''Many of them, in many hearts.''

667
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,180
''What happened and why?''

668
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:19,621
''The heart seems to be
as quiet as a shrine.''

669
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:26,789
''May the blessings
shower on us again!''

670
00:51:26,864 --> 00:51:32,860
''May the blessings give
a sign again!''

671
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:39,205
''May the blessings
shower on us again!''

672
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:45,442
''May the blessings
make this a heaven again!''

673
00:51:58,295 --> 00:52:06,760
''Look at how lonesome
l seem without you today.''

674
00:52:10,574 --> 00:52:19,243
''Just like a moment
lost in the sea of time.''

675
00:52:21,852 --> 00:52:28,257
''Come and reconcile.''

676
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:34,328
''Come and cheer me up.''

677
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:40,333
''l won't be able to
live in such sadness.''

678
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:43,802
''The memories ask me
every single moment...''

679
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:46,809
''...why are there tears
in your eyes?''

680
00:52:46,877 --> 00:52:52,941
''May the blessings
shower on us again!''

681
00:52:53,016 --> 00:52:59,285
''May the blessings give
a sign again!''

682
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:20,468
l think you should tell the kids...

683
00:53:21,545 --> 00:53:25,914
Tell the kids? You said the
treatment is going fine...

684
00:53:26,617 --> 00:53:28,312
lt was going fine...Not anymore...

685
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:30,318
Try another treatment then...

686
00:53:30,387 --> 00:53:34,414
There are so many people who
survive Cancer these days...

687
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:38,321
Cervical cancer has protective
measures but Maya's case...

688
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:40,327
Maya!! excuse me.

689
00:53:40,931 --> 00:53:43,991
Maya!! Maya please
listen to me!! Maya.

690
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:45,329
No Aman!

691
00:53:45,936 --> 00:53:47,733
She's asking us to tell the kids...

692
00:53:48,472 --> 00:53:50,337
You know what that means...

693
00:53:51,341 --> 00:53:53,935
How will we tell them?
What will we tell them?

694
00:53:54,011 --> 00:53:55,342
That their mother is dying...

695
00:53:56,446 --> 00:53:57,743
How does one do that?

696
00:53:57,814 --> 00:53:58,872
l don't know...

697
00:53:59,082 --> 00:54:00,344
And l don't want to do that...

698
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:03,352
...because l know you are
going to be all right...

699
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:07,022
You are not going to
die dammit!! Trust me!

700
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:11,585

701
00:54:14,965 --> 00:54:16,023

Okay okay...it's okay...

718
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,025
This means war!!

719
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:23,430
Attack!!!!

720
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:31,703
''We are a family.''

00:55:31,775 --> 00:55:34,869
''We are a family.''

00:55:35,779 --> 00:55:37,440
Get them!!

723
00:55:48,992 --> 00:55:50,459

Okay, okay, okay,

725
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:59,128
The winners will feed the
losers...done deal - Ya.

726
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:01,466
Sorry, l am not cooking!!

727
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:03,738
What happened to you?

728
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:07,000
l'm not Mama today...
l'm Anjali...

729
00:56:07,144 --> 00:56:12,138
And l want pizza...pizza

730
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:22,923
''Look at us. We are a family.''

731
00:56:22,993 --> 00:56:27,521
''All of us. Look at us.''

732
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:29,822
''We are a family.''

733
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:41,102
Kids kids kids...

734
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:42,668
l want to tell you something...

735
00:56:43,113 --> 00:56:46,514
We know...Papa and you
are a couple again...

736
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:48,141
And we're a family again!!

737
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,745
Wrong baby!!

738
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:56,514
Actually...l'm not well...

739
00:56:57,527 --> 00:56:58,585
l am sick!!

740
00:56:58,662 --> 00:57:01,597
You have fever? Because
you were playing in water?

741
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:03,891
Not fever...

742
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:06,262
lt's a little different!

743
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:17,546
When germs attack our body there
are special soldiers in our body...

744
00:57:17,614 --> 00:57:21,277
...who fight them and kill them...

745
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:27,887
But sometimes the soldiers
make a mistake and...

746
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:30,893
...start attacking our body...

747
00:57:32,562 --> 00:57:33,620
What do you mean?

748
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:40,568
l'm being treated by
a special doctor...

749
00:57:40,804 --> 00:57:42,829
An oncologist...She has...

750
00:57:42,906 --> 00:57:46,967
Oncologist...
means cancer specialist?

751
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:49,837
What?

752
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,740
You have cancer...

753
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:56,176
Yes...

754
00:57:56,253 --> 00:57:58,050
Liars...both of you are liars!!

755
00:57:58,121 --> 00:57:59,986
Aleya please trust me...

756
00:58:00,257 --> 00:58:01,588
Nothing is going to
happen to Mama...

757
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:02,920
Why should l trust you?

758
00:58:03,593 --> 00:58:04,855
You always lie...

759
00:58:05,595 --> 00:58:07,256
You said you would never
leave us and go away...

760
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:09,056
But you did...

761
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:14,064
And now you too...?

762
00:58:15,939 --> 00:58:17,065
Aleya it's not...

763
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:25,672
Mama where are you going?

764
00:58:28,285 --> 00:58:29,343
Nowhere my child...

765
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:33,080
Nowhere...

766
00:58:59,334 --> 00:59:02,997
Papa...What happens
when people die?

767
00:59:05,807 --> 00:59:08,901
l don't
know...Actually no one knows...

768
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:12,980
Different people have
different beliefs...

769
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:20,545
But Mama say people
become stars when they die...

770
00:59:20,622 --> 00:59:23,056
...and then keep looking
after us from above...

771
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:25,483
How is it possible papa?

772
00:59:25,994 --> 00:59:29,555
l have tried to explain it many
times that stars are not people...

773
00:59:29,831 --> 00:59:34,825
...but made of molten material
but she just doesn't get it...

774
00:59:34,903 --> 00:59:36,427
Well you see my scientist...

775
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:40,835
Sometimes even after your mind
knows so much of the universe...

776
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:42,900
...it still listens to your heart...

777
00:59:44,379 --> 00:59:45,846
Maybe someday science will release...

778
00:59:45,914 --> 00:59:50,851
...that what our heart
says is the real truth...

779
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:58,253
Maybe when we die we do become
stars and watch from above...

780
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:02,159
ls Mama also going to be a star?

781
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,058
Never...

782
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:08,927
Never...

783
01:00:09,004 --> 01:00:10,869
Because we will never let
it happen...

784
01:00:11,206 --> 01:00:13,071
We'll hold her tight...

785
01:00:44,906 --> 01:00:46,237
l can't believe this!!

786
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:47,903
Aman is not at home...

787
01:00:48,176 --> 01:00:49,438
l haven't come to meet him...

788
01:00:50,645 --> 01:00:51,907
l am sorry to intrude...

789
01:00:52,914 --> 01:00:54,245
l got something for Anjali...

790
01:00:55,517 --> 01:00:56,575
What?

791
01:00:56,985 --> 01:00:58,043
Crown...

792
01:00:58,653 --> 01:01:00,450
l know l shouldn't be here...

793
01:01:01,923 --> 01:01:03,914
But l had promised Anjali...

794
01:01:03,992 --> 01:01:05,459
And l don't like breaking
promises!!!

795
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:07,220
lt'll just take a minute...

796
01:01:09,931 --> 01:01:10,989
Please!

797
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:15,033
D ,D, D...

798
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:18,533
What's in this?

799
01:01:21,943 --> 01:01:23,410
A princess's crown?

800
01:01:23,612 --> 01:01:26,240
With gold and diamonds?
ls it real?

801
01:01:26,314 --> 01:01:27,372
Ofcourse!!

802
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:29,940
lt has rubies and sapphires too...

803
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:34,187
l stole it from a very
beautiful princess for you...

804
01:01:34,623 --> 01:01:36,147
Don't tell anyone...

805
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:38,016
its our secret!!

806
01:01:41,329 --> 01:01:43,297
Got something for
Ankush and Aleya too...

807
01:01:45,567 --> 01:01:46,625
They are upstairs...

808
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,961
lts bout lndians
living outside lndia...

809
01:01:51,139 --> 01:01:52,606
Thought you'd like it...

810
01:01:54,976 --> 01:01:56,034
Thank you D!!!

811
01:02:07,455 --> 01:02:08,513
Aleya's inside...

812
01:02:09,257 --> 01:02:10,315
But she's asleep...

813
01:02:11,526 --> 01:02:12,584
Now?

814
01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:13,992
She is not feeling well !!

815
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:16,121
What?

816
01:02:17,999 --> 01:02:20,627
Aleya? Aleya?

817
01:02:24,172 --> 01:02:25,469
Ankush where is she?

818
01:02:27,442 --> 01:02:29,433
Umm...party...

819
01:02:30,145 --> 01:02:32,010
Party? What party?

820
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,638
Where? Who's she gone with?

821
01:02:34,616 --> 01:02:36,243
Alone...To Candy's house...

822
01:02:36,484 --> 01:02:39,612
Her parents are
out...Sleepover types...

823
01:02:41,189 --> 01:02:42,679
Why didn't she tell me?

824
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,320
Are you sure it's just a sleepover?

825
01:02:47,762 --> 01:02:51,630
l heard on the phone
that there's beer there...

826
01:02:52,567 --> 01:02:54,228
And boys too...

827
01:02:55,036 --> 01:02:57,027
Beer!!! Boys!!

828
01:02:57,439 --> 01:02:58,667
She's just thirteen!!!

829
01:03:03,044 --> 01:03:05,035
l don't know why Aman's
not answering the phone...

830
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:08,340
l got the address...

831
01:03:08,416 --> 01:03:09,474
C'mon lets get her!!

832
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:42,573
Grownups are here!!

833
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:03,161
Aleya!

834
01:04:04,105 --> 01:04:05,163
Aleya!!

835
01:04:30,131 --> 01:04:31,291
What happened?
- Aman.

836
01:04:31,366 --> 01:04:32,424
You gave four missed calls and
then didn't answer the phone...

837
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,468
l am fine...l am fine. Ok

838
01:04:34,669 --> 01:04:36,603
Just...just relax!!

839
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:39,197
What's going on?

840
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:42,140
Why is she dressed like this?

841
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:45,203
Just relax!!

842
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,338
lt's all my fault...

843
01:04:48,817 --> 01:04:51,752
l had promised Aleya that l would
take her to the fashion show...

844
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:56,283
So l took
her...Dressed her up a bit...

845
01:04:58,693 --> 01:04:59,751
Did you know this?

846
01:05:00,161 --> 01:05:01,355
Did you give permission?

847
01:05:03,164 --> 01:05:05,428
No...She didn't know...

848
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:10,267
That's why she came looking
for her and called you...

849
01:05:11,773 --> 01:05:12,831
That's it!!!

850
01:05:14,642 --> 01:05:16,405
You will never come
anywhere close to my kids...

851
01:05:18,346 --> 01:05:19,404
Please go!

852
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,578
Best of luck!!!

853
01:06:04,526 --> 01:06:07,393
You want to know why...Right?

854
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:11,321
Everyone laughs at me...

855
01:06:13,401 --> 01:06:15,392
No one wants to be friends with me...

856
01:06:17,672 --> 01:06:20,664
They say l'm 'uncool'...

857
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,569
But you don't let me do anything...

858
01:06:27,715 --> 01:06:28,773
l am sorry baby.

859
01:06:30,585 --> 01:06:32,246
l was only trying to protect you!!

860
01:06:32,654 --> 01:06:34,713
l don't need you...

861
01:06:36,257 --> 01:06:39,784
ln any case you are not
going to be around much longer...

862
01:06:41,262 --> 01:06:42,320
So why bother?

863
01:06:45,266 --> 01:06:49,327
One minute...l'm not
going out of my own will...

864
01:06:51,272 --> 01:06:53,866
You think all this is easy for me?

865
01:06:55,877 --> 01:06:59,404
l fight everyday so that
l can live a little longer...

866
01:06:59,481 --> 01:07:00,880
Just for you guys...

867
01:07:02,884 --> 01:07:03,942
Only for you!!

868
01:07:05,453 --> 01:07:06,750
l don't want to go!!

869
01:07:08,957 --> 01:07:10,356
Then don't go mama!!

870
01:07:12,961 --> 01:07:14,292
Then don't go!!

871
01:07:14,762 --> 01:07:20,962
''Have mercy on us, once again.''

872
01:07:21,035 --> 01:07:27,304
''Have mercy on us, let it happen.''

873
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:33,336
''Have mercy on us, once again.''

874
01:07:33,414 --> 01:07:38,317
''Have mercy on us, let it happen.''

875
01:07:38,386 --> 01:07:40,320
Mama...What if she comes here?

876
01:07:42,924 --> 01:07:44,391
We will throw water on her...

877
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:47,323
Witches melt in water...Remember?

878
01:07:47,795 --> 01:07:49,353
That's why they don't even bathe...

879
01:08:44,385 --> 01:08:45,443
Hi!!

880
01:08:46,921 --> 01:08:47,979
Maya?

881
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:03,401
Are they yours?

882
01:09:08,142 --> 01:09:09,404
They're good!!

883
01:09:18,086 --> 01:09:22,147
You didn't have to take all
the responsibility that night...

884
01:09:22,423 --> 01:09:23,890
l didn't do it for you...

885
01:09:25,026 --> 01:09:26,084
Believe me!!

886
01:09:36,638 --> 01:09:38,435
l need to chat with you...

887
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,907
l want to tell you something...

888
01:09:53,054 --> 01:09:54,612
l am really sorry about everything!!

889
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:58,452
But l can't do this...

890
01:10:01,462 --> 01:10:02,520
Why?

891
01:10:07,468 --> 01:10:08,833
l'm a career woman, Maya...

892
01:10:10,705 --> 01:10:11,763
Not the Mom type...

893
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,636
lf you are a woman then you are
the Mom type...Let me tell you...

894
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:18,474
Every girl has this Mom
formula hidden in her...

895
01:10:18,546 --> 01:10:19,604
...as soon as she is born...

896
01:10:20,748 --> 01:10:23,478
Career women like you forget this...

897
01:10:24,218 --> 01:10:26,482
But when the time comes you
will remember everything...

898
01:10:30,925 --> 01:10:33,485
Look l can't!!!
- Scared that you will fail?

899
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:36,025
Can't take the challenge? Chicken?

900
01:10:40,568 --> 01:10:43,093
Don't blame me if things go wrong...

901
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,503
Only if l'm alive by then...

902
01:10:52,246 --> 01:10:53,770
Mama who's coming?

903
01:10:55,116 --> 01:10:56,174
My friend...

904
01:10:58,186 --> 01:11:00,245
Why is she coming to stay with us?

905
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:11,257
To help me...

906
01:11:21,676 --> 01:11:22,734
Pillows!!

Thanks!!

1146
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:43,113
Come let's go!!

1147
01:27:50,597 --> 01:27:51,757
Hey guys. What's happening?

1148
01:27:51,832 --> 01:27:54,062
We are making peanut
butter cookies...

1149
01:27:54,735 --> 01:27:55,793
Try it Anjali...

1150
01:27:55,869 --> 01:27:58,269
No, Anjali. Stop.
Spit it out...Spit it...

1151
01:27:58,872 --> 01:28:01,136
Right now!! Go and
gargle right now!! Go!!

1152
01:28:03,043 --> 01:28:04,101
Oh God!!

1153
01:28:04,611 --> 01:28:08,138
What do you think of yourself?
lt was a cookie, not poison...

1154
01:28:09,616 --> 01:28:10,708
l have had it with your attitude!!

1155
01:28:11,084 --> 01:28:12,779
You called me yourself and now?

1156
01:28:14,221 --> 01:28:17,554
When everything is going well...
the kids are getting friendly...

1157
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:20,286
You have started this new game...

1158
01:28:21,094 --> 01:28:22,186
What's your problem?

1159
01:28:22,262 --> 01:28:24,560
Anjali is allergic to peanuts...

1160
01:28:25,098 --> 01:28:27,589
lf she ate that she
wouldn't be able to breathe...

1161
01:28:27,667 --> 01:28:29,225
We would have to
go to the hospital...

1162
01:28:29,903 --> 01:28:32,098
lf you had read the
list you would know...

1163
01:28:32,172 --> 01:28:33,230
l have read the list...

1164
01:28:35,108 --> 01:28:37,736
But it's so long that
l don't remember everything...

1165
01:28:37,911 --> 01:28:39,310
How can you forget?

1166
01:28:39,913 --> 01:28:41,175
When will you learn to
take care of the kids?

1167
01:28:41,248 --> 01:28:42,306
Oh stop it!!

1168
01:28:42,649 --> 01:28:44,810
You behave as if you have
always been this perfect...

1169
01:28:45,652 --> 01:28:47,119
You didn't fall from the
sky as a readymade Mom...

1170
01:28:47,921 --> 01:28:49,616
You must have taken time to learn...

1171
01:28:49,689 --> 01:28:51,247
Yes l did...But not as long as you...

1172
01:28:51,658 --> 01:28:52,989
Haven't you learnt
anything from your Mom?

1173
01:28:53,059 --> 01:28:54,822
No...l did not...

1174
01:28:58,265 --> 01:28:59,960
l was six months old
when she died...

1175
01:29:05,939 --> 01:29:07,167
l can't do this anymore...

1176
01:29:08,942 --> 01:29:10,000
l can't...

1177
01:29:55,856 --> 01:29:56,914
What is all this Maya?

1178
01:29:59,326 --> 01:30:01,385
What's right...

1179
01:30:03,163 --> 01:30:04,994
lf something had happened
to Anjali...

1180
01:30:08,068 --> 01:30:10,662
She's not right for the kids, Aman...
- How will she be right?

1181
01:30:12,205 --> 01:30:13,399
You don't allow that to happen...

1182
01:30:14,741 --> 01:30:16,265
You don't know...

1183
01:30:16,343 --> 01:30:18,334
That's enough Maya!! Please!!

1184
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,814
There's a limit to being stubborn...

1185
01:30:23,016 --> 01:30:25,007
You want to give the
kids a normal life...

1186
01:30:25,886 --> 01:30:27,353
But they are only getting confused...

1187
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:28,682
They are kids Maya!!

1188
01:30:30,223 --> 01:30:32,054
They don't understand all of this...

1189
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,692
They don't take long
to love someone...

1190
01:30:35,762 --> 01:30:39,357
...but it takes a long
time for them to forget...

1191
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:41,767
This is not good for them!!!

1192
01:30:43,904 --> 01:30:45,428
We all care about the kids...

1193
01:30:46,973 --> 01:30:48,031
Not you alone...

1194
01:30:49,843 --> 01:30:50,901
Aman l...

1195
01:30:50,977 --> 01:30:52,774
What? You were protecting them?

1196
01:30:54,314 --> 01:30:56,373
Stop getting the kids
into all this, Maya...

1197
01:30:56,449 --> 01:30:57,973
lt's not about them!!

1198
01:30:58,251 --> 01:31:00,048
lt's about you and her!

1199
01:31:02,055 --> 01:31:03,716
And till you don't accept her...

1200
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:05,724
...she will never be
right for the kids...

1201
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:08,022
Just accept it and
stop being a hypocrite!!

1202
01:31:09,329 --> 01:31:10,387
Maya?

1203
01:31:11,798 --> 01:31:12,856
Maya?

1204
01:31:49,903 --> 01:31:50,961
Papa...

1205
01:31:56,776 --> 01:31:57,834
lt's okay!!

1206
01:31:58,378 --> 01:31:59,777
The medicines reacted badly...

1207
01:31:59,846 --> 01:32:01,507
Mama is going to be ok!!

1208
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,451
Shreya!!
- lt's ok!!!

1209
01:32:09,189 --> 01:32:10,451
You take care of Maya...

1210
01:32:11,391 --> 01:32:12,824
l'll take care of the kids!!

1211
01:32:15,061 --> 01:32:16,119
Thank you!!

1212
01:32:35,348 --> 01:32:39,876
''lf you go away...''

1213
01:32:41,421 --> 01:32:46,256
''...this world will

1214
01:32:48,128 --> 01:32:52,827

1215
01:32:52,899 --> 01:32:58,565
''...will be faded.''

1216
01:33:01,074 --> 01:33:06,512
''Every happiness is related to you.''

''There's nothing without you.''

1218
01:33:13,453 --> 01:33:19,255
''We love you, we ask for you.''

1219
01:33:20,193 --> 01:33:26,530
''O sky, listen to our prayers.''

1220
01:33:38,445 --> 01:33:43,883
''Come let's weave...''

1221
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:49,946
''...little...little dreams together.''

1222
01:33:51,224 --> 01:33:55,888
''l promise you that...''

1223
01:33:55,962 --> 01:34:02,526
''...l'll not leave you.''

1224
01:34:04,237 --> 01:34:09,641
''We want to live for you.''

1225
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:16,346
''We won't get angry with you.''

1226
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:22,249
''No matter you take our life...''

1227
01:34:23,189 --> 01:34:29,651
''...but we'll not let you go.''

1228
01:36:09,295 --> 01:36:11,092
Mama l am a fairy...

1229
01:36:11,164 --> 01:36:13,155
l have come to give
you three wishes...

1230
01:36:13,233 --> 01:36:14,291
First wish?

1231
01:36:17,103 --> 01:36:18,570
l want to be home for Diwali...

1232
01:36:20,306 --> 01:36:21,705
Done!!
- Yes!!

1233
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:23,603
Second wish?

1234
01:36:25,578 --> 01:36:26,636
C'mon kids...

1235
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:28,608
Let Mama rest...

1236
01:36:29,449 --> 01:36:30,780
Just a minute...

1237
01:36:32,318 --> 01:36:34,343
My kids should always be
by my side...

1238
01:36:35,388 --> 01:36:36,446
Done!!

1239
01:36:36,522 --> 01:36:38,046
Now last wish!!

1240
01:36:38,124 --> 01:36:39,614
Think before asking...

1241
01:36:43,396 --> 01:36:45,057
l wish...

1242
01:36:45,665 --> 01:36:47,189
D should be here...

1243
01:36:52,739 --> 01:36:54,070
Call her in...

1244
01:37:02,282 --> 01:37:04,648
How did you know?

1245
01:37:08,621 --> 01:37:09,679
By this...

1246
01:37:13,693 --> 01:37:14,751
This...

1247
01:37:18,631 --> 01:37:19,689
And this...

1248
01:37:22,769 --> 01:37:24,168
All of you are looking crazy...

1249
01:37:29,676 --> 01:37:33,168
Mama's third wish was
that you should be here...

1250
01:37:38,451 --> 01:37:39,850
C'mon...shall we go
and have some ice cream?

1251
01:37:40,119 --> 01:37:41,177
Yeah? C'mon!!

1252
01:38:01,307 --> 01:38:02,535
Were they really looking crazy?

1253
01:38:13,486 --> 01:38:14,578
Anjali was three...

1254
01:38:16,756 --> 01:38:17,882
And she nearly died...

1255
01:38:19,225 --> 01:38:20,283
lt was my fault...

1256
01:38:21,561 --> 01:38:22,619
No way!!!

1257
01:38:24,764 --> 01:38:26,391
How could you make a mistake?

1258
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,558
You are a perfect Mom...

1259
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:33,296
We were in a mall...

1260
01:38:33,773 --> 01:38:35,832
She was crying...
Throwing a tantrum...

1261
01:38:38,511 --> 01:38:42,914
l just gave her a packet of
biscuits without looking at it...

1262
01:38:46,386 --> 01:38:47,648
Peanut butter cookies...

1263
01:38:51,791 --> 01:38:53,258
Why didn't you tell me then?

1264
01:39:00,733 --> 01:39:03,759
Dammit Maya...you can't die!!

1265
01:39:04,871 --> 01:39:06,270
You can't do this...

1266
01:39:07,273 --> 01:39:10,765
They need you...Not me...

1267
01:39:12,278 --> 01:39:13,939
You know their entire life...

1268
01:39:14,614 --> 01:39:18,516
Every story...every
wound...Every tear...

1269
01:39:19,886 --> 01:39:21,217
You are their mother...

1270
01:39:24,757 --> 01:39:25,951
You will learn too...

1271
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:31,956
l'm scared...

1272
01:39:35,435 --> 01:39:36,493
Why?

1273
01:39:39,705 --> 01:39:42,230
After a few years
when Aleya will marry...

1274
01:39:42,308 --> 01:39:45,243
...and l will help her
get ready at the wedding...

1275
01:39:46,846 --> 01:39:48,279
Do her hair...

1276
01:39:49,916 --> 01:39:51,247
Adorn her with jewellery...

1277
01:39:53,920 --> 01:40:00,985
At that moment she will be thinking
wish My Mom was here today'...

1278
01:40:03,863 --> 01:40:08,800
And l'm scared that she won't...

1279
01:40:12,472 --> 01:40:16,340
But why does she have to
choose between us, Shreya?

1280
01:40:18,811 --> 01:40:20,870
She can love us both...

1281
01:40:25,852 --> 01:40:30,551
l have their yesterday...

1282
01:40:34,627 --> 01:40:39,655
...and you have their tomorrow...

1283
01:40:47,907 --> 01:40:49,340
Things are not looking good Aman!!

1284
01:40:49,642 --> 01:40:51,769
Maya is not
responding to the treatment!

1285
01:40:52,378 --> 01:40:53,436
So what do we do now?

1286
01:40:56,916 --> 01:40:59,043
Now we just have to wait and watch...

1287
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:00,710
Time is little now...

1288
01:41:10,530 --> 01:41:11,588
We will take her home...

1289
01:41:16,402 --> 01:41:20,338
She can't spend her last
days at the hospital...

1290
01:42:51,597 --> 01:42:53,724
This is for you...

1291
01:42:53,799 --> 01:42:55,790
Magic Wand?
- Yes.

1292
01:42:56,636 --> 01:42:59,764
Whenever you wave
this l will be here...

1293
01:43:01,707 --> 01:43:05,700
Even if you can't see me
remember l'm always there...

1294
01:43:05,778 --> 01:43:06,836
Always?

1295
01:43:07,113 --> 01:43:08,603
Always and Forever...

1296
01:43:12,985 --> 01:43:14,816
Are you going to die mamma?

1297
01:43:19,025 --> 01:43:20,083
Yes baby.

1298
01:43:20,993 --> 01:43:22,460
Are you scared?

1299
01:43:26,132 --> 01:43:27,190
A little...

1300
01:43:27,967 --> 01:43:29,832

Your Papa had given me this ring...

1305
01:43:48,888 --> 01:43:49,946
At the wedding...

1306
01:43:55,161 --> 01:43:57,959
You can't hold on to
relationships Too tight...

1307
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:04,564
Sometimes they work...
Sometimes they don't...

1308
01:44:08,507 --> 01:44:10,998
There's only one way
to approach them...

1309
01:44:13,579 --> 01:44:14,637
Love...

1310
01:44:32,131 --> 01:44:33,598
