3
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:26,110
It is a complete amount of 5 lakhs.
Count it.

4
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:29,595
- You have counted it, right Mr. Malhotra?
- Yes, sir.

5
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:31,068
Then what's the need for
me to count it?

6
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:32,092
Thank you, sir.

7
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:36,233
Why did you take the
trouble to come so far?

8
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:37,495
You should've sent somebody else.

9
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:41,210
This is not the only work I had,
I had two more appointments in the city.

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,080
Income tax case
and I had to meet the lawyer too.

11
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:49,057
Forgive me sir, at this age
you do more work than needed.

12
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:51,225
That is why I am not old yet,
Mr. Khan.

13
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,273
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

14
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:44,671
Sir, a jeep is following us.

15
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,226
Driver, drive the car faster.

16
00:03:00,392 --> 00:03:01,621
Fast!

17
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:46,956
I have given him injections for sleep.
Till tomorrow morning he will be alright.

18
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:49,252
The wound isn't very deep.

19
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:51,887
He needs rest for 2-3 days.
There is no need to be afraid.

20
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:54,123
Well, thank God.

21
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,755
- Okay Mr. Rai, good night.
- Good night.

22
00:05:57,585 --> 00:06:00,203
Even now,
in this world there are people..

23
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:04,340
Who risk their lives
in saving other's lives.

24
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:06,375
You are right, Shobha.

25
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:11,243
Ashu, Raju go to sleep, children.
It's very late.

26
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,918
Come on.

27
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:25,495
- Good morning, mister..
- Anand.

28
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:28,541
- Thank you, mister...
- Rajesh Kumar.

29
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:32,198
People call me as Raju.
I am Mr. Rai's son.

30
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:34,063
And this is my sister.

31
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,189
This is my sister, Asha.
People call her as Ashu.

32
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,913
A name is always said lovingly.

33
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:47,293
What do you say, Raju?
What do you say, Ashu?

34
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:51,413
- So, Anand. How are you now?
- I am alright.

35
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:58,623
- What are you doing, ma'am?
- You have saved my husband, son.

36
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:02,079
I can't forget your
favour throughout my life.

37
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:06,314
May God make give
my long age to you too.

38
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:27,457
Sir has come.

39
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:29,682
There is going to be
a problem today as well.

40
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,961
- Mother.
- Rakesh?

41
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,759
Today you have remembered your mother.

42
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,577
Whenever I need money, mother,
I am reminded of you.

43
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,582
Not much. I just need Rs. 5000.

44
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:53,740
Son, more than money I have
the wealth of a mother's love.

45
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:57,746
Sometimes come around to
take your mother's blessings.

46
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,591
The blessings that
I get through money, mother..

47
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:04,339
They are completely unique.

48
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,252
Hurry up, mother.
I have very less time. Please.

49
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,613
Brother, why did you leave home?

50
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,327
You don't even come to meet us?

51
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:24,478
Brother, you will have to wait here today.

52
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:27,546
You will have to hear my story
and sister's song.

53
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,292
I don't have time for such rubbish.

54
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,054
Just last week you took Rs. 10000.

55
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:37,353
- Have they been spent fully?
- My great mother!

56
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:40,455
I haven't come to give an account.

57
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,162
He hasn't come to give an account.
He has come to take the account

58
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:53,250
- of your love of a mother and my patience.
- Daddy!

59
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:57,851
Until when will you pay
this tax for being a mother?

60
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:00,867
You don't need to come
between a mother and son.

61
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:05,944
I do! I can't see my hard earned
money be wasted anymore.

62
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:10,152
Why? Doesn't your son have
a right your hard earned money?

63
00:09:10,232 --> 00:09:13,457
You had a right!
You have lost it due to your actions.

64
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:17,687
- I have done everything for you.
- You have done a father's duty.

65
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:22,340
I did much more than that.
It was my mistake.

66
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:25,702
I handed my whole business to you.

67
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:29,651
But there you didn't do anything
other than dishonesty and squandering.

68
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,554
I thought that you would
carry our old age's burden.

69
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:36,319
But it is regretful.

70
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:40,098
Today, all the burden of
your loose-handedness and ill-fame..

71
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:41,463
Has to be carried by me.

72
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,276
My name comes with your name.

73
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:46,866
And my neck is bent due to shame.

74
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:49,128
I haven't come here
to listen to this nonsense.

75
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,815
I want money!

76
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:55,328
I am paying you a liability of being
your father Rs. 5000 every month.

77
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:57,620
This Rs. 5000 is like alms to me.

78
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:59,694
And alms can never fill one's stomach.

79
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:01,480
Is that why you are filling
your stomach these days by stealing?

80
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:03,627
- Stealing?
- Yes, stealing.

81
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:08,852
Yesterday you forged my signatures
and had a cheque of Rs. 10000 cashed.

82
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,827
If I wanted to,
I would have handed you to the police.

83
00:10:11,907 --> 00:10:15,291
If a father sits like a snake on wealth
that is what a son will have to do!

84
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:16,541
Stupid!

85
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:23,952
Get out of here! I said get out!

86
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:27,198
Rakesh, don't break
your daddy's heart and go.

87
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:29,617
- Ask for forgiveness, son.
- No mother!

88
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:35,325
Brother, you want money, right?
Take this.

89
00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:00,414
Why are you missing
your shots today, Mr. Rai?

90
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:04,277
A man misses many things in his life,
Mr. Mathur.

91
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,969
- Greetings, Mr. Rai.
- Greetings. Come in.

92
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,771
Tell me, what is it? This time you
came to the club after a long time.

93
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:15,070
Meet him, my son Javed.

94
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,031
And he is one of
my specially known men.

95
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:19,124
- Greetings, uncle.
- Bless you, son.

96
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,836
Tell me, what are you doing?

97
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,345
- I am an engineer.
- He is an engineer.

98
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:27,070
But for me he has become
a military officer.

99
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:30,915
- What do you mean?
- Now I have 6 months to be retired.

100
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:34,403
But he has had me retired early.

101
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,391
Eat on time,
sleep on time, get up on time.

102
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,869
You may say that he
has made me a useless being.

103
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:41,518
He won't let me do any work.

104
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:45,101
Mr. Khan,
you should be proud of your son.

105
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:49,927
May God give such a child to everyone.

106
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:54,205
Take this. A bet of Rs. 200.

107
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,255
Rs. 200.

108
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:58,716
Rs. 400.

109
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:03,634
- Rs. 400.
- Rs. 800.

110
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,467
- Show.
- Is that all?

111
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:13,327
- A show so early?
- You can play on.

112
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:17,595
You're lucky because
your father has just died.

113
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,722
And it's my bad luck
that my father is still alive.

114
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:28,576
Napoleon Bonaparte
was once giving a speech.

115
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:34,775
My brave soldiers! The courage
that you showed in the battlefield..

116
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:38,924
I can't forget it.
But at this time..

117
00:12:39,686 --> 00:12:44,268
Anyone of you may come forward
and show me some dare..

118
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:46,916
Which would be awed by this world.

119
00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:50,608
I will give him the
best award of this world.

120
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,159
One of those soldiers,
whose one hand was chopped off..

121
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:58,401
Came forward
and cut his second hand too.

122
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,694
Tell me, did Napoleon
give him a reward or not?

123
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:06,393
- Tell me quickly.
- He did.

124
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,807
You are wrong.

125
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:11,007
- He didn't.
- That is wrong too.

126
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:15,229
He gave it and took it back.

127
00:13:15,557 --> 00:13:17,268
This is even more wrong.

128
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:20,941
What is right then?

129
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,389
My Raja, if that soldier
had already had one hand cut..

130
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:28,280
How can he cut his second hand?

131
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,726
- Mr. Rai.
- Daddy has come.

132
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:38,877
Daddy, daddy. Uncle made so many
puzzles today! We had a lot of fun.

133
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,954
Thank you, Anand.

134
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,878
Gopal, set food on the table quickly.

135
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:46,679
Come on, daddy.

136
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,015
Son, you people eat.
Today I am not hungry.

137
00:14:16,015 --> 00:14:17,843
Looks like you're
feeling unwell today.

138
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,296
You don't even have medicine properly.
Take this.

139
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,730
It's an old illness, Shobha.

140
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:29,281
It can't be cured by medicine too.

141
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:42,139
I stayed with you people
for just two days.

142
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:45,395
But your love will always be in my heart.

143
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:49,297
Alright, I'll leave now.

144
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:56,211
Anand, we can't ever repay you favour.

145
00:14:58,714 --> 00:14:59,746
Take this.

146
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:11,189
What is this, Mr. Rai?
We poor people only have humanity.

147
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,513
If we sell that too, how will we live?

148
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:22,040
Uncle, give us your address.

149
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,400
Whenever we are in a good mood..

150
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,486
We will come to your home
and listen to puzzles.

151
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:27,701
I don't have an address.

152
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,620
I am here today
and somewhere else tomorrow.

153
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,607
- Why? Don't you have parents or siblings?
- I don't have anyone.

154
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:36,185
- I am alone in this world.
- Alone?

155
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:38,880
- Then stay here.
- Raju is right, Anand.

156
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:41,529
No, Ashu. I need to go.

157
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:44,013
- Tomorrow I have an interview.
- Interview?

158
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:48,221
I don't want to miss
it under any circumstances.

159
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,840
- I have been unemployed for a long time.
- How far have you been educated?

160
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:52,828
B. A.

161
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:57,477
Anand, I want to give you good news.

162
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:00,031
- Good news?
- Yes.

163
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:01,917
You have passed an interview.

164
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:03,921
- What?
- You have got a job.

165
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,062
- A job?
- Yes.

166
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:08,330
From today,
you will work in my office.

167
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,271
But Mr. Rai, you...

168
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:15,215
Look Anand, don't think that
I am doing you a favour.

169
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:19,212
Our company needs
an honest man like you.

170
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:20,813
- What do you say, Shobha?
- Yes, Anand.

171
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,237
Now we will listen
to puzzles every day.

172
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:27,627
Anand, go to the factory
and meet Diwan Chotelal.

173
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:30,534
Yes. Thank you so much.

174
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:40,024
Do you know due to
whom you get your food?

175
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,507
Due to whom you have a job?

176
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:44,599
Ask me. Due to whom?

177
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:49,120
Diwan Chotelal, son of Diwan Khotelal.

178
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,814
Son of Diwan Motelal.

179
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:55,318
If I want to,
I can fire everyone in a minute.

180
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:59,423
And hire you back in the next minute.

181
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:04,189
Go and do your work!
Don't waste my valuable time! Go!

182
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:11,475
- Why are you standing here? Go!
- Well...

183
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,370
I haven't seen him here before.

184
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,865
So, who are you?

185
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:26,706
- Whom do you want to meet?
- Mr. Diwan Chotelal.

186
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:29,680
Diwan Chotelal
doesn't meet an ordinary person.

187
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:32,661
If you want to meet someone,
go and meet Mr. Rai.

188
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:33,852
He has sent me here.

189
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,036
- Mr. Rai has sent you? For what?
- A job.

190
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:42,207
A job and a girl are received
due to luck, boy.

191
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:44,082
Not on Mr. Rai's saying.

192
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:47,293
How would Mr. Rai know
what goes on in this company?

193
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:52,509
He just sends anyone. Sometimes
for money and sometimes for a job.

194
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:55,087
A leaf can move without breeze.

195
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:58,973
But without my order not
even one man can move from here.

196
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:02,971
Now I am going to give Mr. Rai an order
that he can't give me any order.

197
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,919
- At least I can request you, sir.
- Certainly.

198
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:12,384
- Sir you?
- Sorry, Mr. Diwan Chotelal.

199
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:17,153
Without your permission, I have given
Anand the job of chief supervisor.

200
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:19,884
You gave it to him? You did?

201
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:22,135
Then he must be a useful man.

202
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:25,123
And a useful man must get a job.

203
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:28,880
- So, go and explain the work to Anand.
- Very well, sir.

204
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:30,936
Come with me.

205
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:38,255
- There was a very little work...
- Please come.

206
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:16,004
"I am a girl in a boy's disguise."

207
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:20,407
"I stay in Potgarh."

208
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:25,215
"My friends call me."

209
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:29,629
"Inspector."

210
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:34,731
"Oh Lord!
I am a girl in a boy's disguise."

211
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:39,134
"I stay in Potgarh."

212
00:19:39,313 --> 00:19:43,874
"My friends call me."

213
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:48,530
"Inspector."

214
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:54,559
"Oh Lord!
I am a girl in a boy's disguise."

215
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,840
"The one who doesn't work.
I am their enemy."

216
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,860
"I am the friend of hard work."

217
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:23,298
"I am not afraid of anyone.
Everyone is scared of me."

218
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:27,017
"I am the only one of my type."

219
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:32,027
"First work, and then have rest."

220
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:36,514
"First work, and then have rest."

221
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:41,553
"Oh Lord!
I am a girl in a boy's disguise."

222
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:46,083
"I don't be angry on
anyone without reason."

223
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:50,740
"My friends call me."

224
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,157
"Inspector."

225
00:20:55,237 --> 00:21:00,543
"Oh Lord!
I am a girl in a boy's disguise."

226
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:22,315
"We are confidantes of cuckoos the
confidantes of flowers are the cuckoos."

227
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:26,947
"We are confidantes of cuckoos the
confidantes of flowers are the cuckoos."

228
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:35,091
"My time passes by doing
the service of trees."

229
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:44,700
"Making raw fruits sweet."

230
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:50,551
"I make them young. I do my work."

231
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:55,207
"I make them young. I do my work."

232
00:21:55,257 --> 00:22:00,262
"Oh Lord!
I am a girl in a boy's disguise."

233
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:04,784
"I haven't been loved by anyone."

234
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:09,728
"My friends call me."

235
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:14,250
"Inspector."

236
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:19,890
"Oh Lord!
I am a girl in a boy's disguise."

237
00:22:34,672 --> 00:22:39,149
"I am gentle but not ignorant."

238
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,583
"There is cleanliness in my heart."

239
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,518
"I am harsh in a way
and in a way smooth."

240
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,204
"There is a little
roughness in speech."

241
00:22:52,493 --> 00:22:57,271
"I am passionate yet under control."

242
00:22:57,312 --> 00:23:01,552
"I am passionate yet under control."

243
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:06,526
"Oh Lord!
I am a girl in a boy's disguise."

244
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:11,094
"I agree I am a 17-year-old girl"

245
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:15,939
"My friends call me."

246
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,304
"Inspector."

247
00:23:20,384 --> 00:23:26,348
"Oh Lord!
I am a girl in a boy's disguise."

248
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:55,922
First you steal
and then you make tricks.

249
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:57,765
Is this is your father's garden?

250
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:01,553
You thought that no one will see you.
You could steal the apples and flee.

251
00:24:01,695 --> 00:24:04,110
- I am the supervisor of this place.
- Supervisor?

252
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:06,280
Yes. That means inspector.

253
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,295
While an inspector is present,
no single grain can be stolen.

254
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,881
I made a mistake.
Forgive me. Take these.

255
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:15,467
Take them? Now you will have to pay.

256
00:24:15,902 --> 00:24:18,950
You will have to labour
in this hill station's police station.

257
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,146
You will be in a bad state.

258
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,338
Bad state?

259
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:27,361
Between you and me. Keep this.

260
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:29,077
What is this? Rs. 5?

261
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:33,421
Here, take Rs. 5 more.
But let me go, ma'am.

262
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:35,639
Now that's more like it.

263
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:38,604
Between you and me,
do you want more stuff?

264
00:24:39,306 --> 00:24:41,165
Yes.
Come with me.

265
00:24:41,327 --> 00:24:42,457
- Where?
- Come on.

266
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,476
Here.

267
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:52,246
- How much can you give me?
- At this time I can give you 2 crates.

268
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,123
It's the fruit that has just been
taken off the tree. Completely fresh.

269
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:57,787
- You will get it for 100 in the market.
- Let's adjust 50 for 100.

270
00:24:58,337 --> 00:24:59,724
You are great!

271
00:25:01,217 --> 00:25:04,105
- Take cash and have fun.
- Come.

272
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,557
Take these 2 crates.

273
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:11,871
Hey! What are you doing?

274
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:14,616
That what an honest person
does with a dishonest one.

275
00:25:15,357 --> 00:25:18,584
Madho! Hariya! Vimla!
He was going to pay me a bribe.

276
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:21,917
I have caught a thief.
The whole nation is ruined due to these..

277
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,672
Ruffians who pay bribes.

278
00:25:23,752 --> 00:25:26,269
- Go quickly and call uncle Diwan.
- Alright, Shanno.

279
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,381
He stole fruits
and then tried to bribe me.

280
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:31,562
- A bribe? You are bribing me?
- O God!

281
00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:34,420
It's not a bribe.
It is a child's dessert, Diwan.

282
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:36,400
Then say so.

283
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:40,352
Mr. Diwan, Shanno has caught a thief.

284
00:25:40,393 --> 00:25:42,121
- He was giving her a bribe.
- A bribe?

285
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:45,744
- Oh God!
- I can forgive a hundred murders..

286
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:47,822
But not a bribe. Come with me.

287
00:25:48,684 --> 00:25:50,177
Dishonest man!

288
00:25:50,604 --> 00:25:53,237
Where is that dishonest
man who was bribing the inspector?

289
00:25:53,477 --> 00:25:54,662
So, dishonest man...

290
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:56,673
I mean, gentleman.

291
00:25:56,897 --> 00:26:00,579
Shanno, what have you done?
This is our chief-supervisor.

292
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,190
Your officer.

293
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,435
It isn't written on his head.

294
00:26:04,634 --> 00:26:06,862
And I was doing my duty.

295
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:08,672
I too was doing my duty.

296
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,996
It's not written on your
head that you are honest.

297
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:14,170
So, you were testing me?

298
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,323
And you were testing me.

299
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,329
I am very happy that
you two are honest.

300
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:22,811
- Take your money back.
- Keep it with you.

301
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:25,943
- What?
- Not as a bribe, as a reward.

302
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:27,184
Forgive me, sir.

303
00:26:27,264 --> 00:26:29,733
Shanno doesn't desire a reward
but what she desires is honour.

304
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:33,243
Take this. Good day.

305
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:38,141
- This girl has a character.
- Character?

306
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:42,515
Mr. Anand, character is found
in our company's every director..

307
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:46,458
Every contractor
and even in every tractor.

308
00:26:47,256 --> 00:26:49,825
Honesty is our company's trade mark.

309
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:52,345
There are many people who give bribes.

310
00:26:52,503 --> 00:26:56,560
But you won't find even
one here who takes bribes.

311
00:26:58,892 --> 00:27:00,205
Thank you.

312
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:06,752
That's the limit!

313
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,157
The train of high prices is going
at full speed.

314
00:27:09,237 --> 00:27:10,477
I don't know when it will stop.

315
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:14,048
Mother, here are the supplies
for the whole month.

316
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,564
And here is my salary
for the whole month.

317
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:21,234
And here are your medicines.

318
00:27:21,526 --> 00:27:25,359
Eat the tablets before eating food
and medicine after eating lunch.

319
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:26,845
Did you understand?

320
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:36,398
- Child.
- Yes, mother.

321
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:38,536
This is your age to play.

322
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:42,099
You have to carry the
burden of the whole house.

323
00:27:42,512 --> 00:27:44,289
- I have...
- Only one worry.

324
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:48,474
To get you married
and send you to your home.

325
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:50,087
Isn't that it? Look, mother.

326
00:27:50,424 --> 00:27:52,809
I'll get married as you tell me to.

327
00:27:53,086 --> 00:27:55,584
But I will never go to another home.

328
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:57,415
Your son-in-law will have
to come to this home..

329
00:27:57,439 --> 00:28:00,061
Through a marriage procession
instead of me.

330
00:28:00,354 --> 00:28:01,883
Crazy girl, does that ever happen?

331
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:03,908
It doesn't, but that's how it will be.

332
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:06,998
Because I can't leave you
and you can't leave me.

333
00:28:07,156 --> 00:28:09,600
And that man won't
be able to leave us both.

334
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:17,394
Hey! Get me a beer.

335
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:25,118
Move aside...

336
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:30,374
- Hey! Stop the vehicle!
- Hey, move!

337
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,910
Move your car behind.

338
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:47,299
- You move your car behind.
- I won't.

339
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,985
Is it so? I'll move it.

340
00:28:57,178 --> 00:29:00,771
Hey! I say stop it!

341
00:29:01,143 --> 00:29:04,738
What are you doing?
I said, you bloody fool stop it!

342
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:15,075
What is this insolence?

343
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:20,826
You injured this
man due to negligence.

344
00:29:21,313 --> 00:29:22,881
You crushed his sheep.

345
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:24,878
And you are moving away as
if nothing has happened.

346
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:26,241
Why are you having a problem?

347
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:28,532
- Who is he for you?
- My relative.

348
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:30,309
What relation does he share with you?

349
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:32,777
Relation of humanity.

350
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:36,676
- You don't have any value for it.
- Oh hell with it!

351
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,737
Here is the price.

352
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,204
That is compensation
for his loss of goods.

353
00:29:42,924 --> 00:29:45,100
Now who will pay the price
for his this condition?

354
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,263
What do you mean?

355
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,038
Sir, you will have to
ask forgiveness from this man.

356
00:29:51,228 --> 00:29:52,878
Don't you know who I am?

357
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:54,648
I know you very well.

358
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:57,641
But sir, I am helpless.

359
00:29:58,145 --> 00:29:59,704
You will have to say sorry.

360
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:02,455
What do you say, sir?
Didn't I say the right thing?

361
00:30:05,944 --> 00:30:07,608
You tinny servant!

362
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:09,521
Do you dare you raise your head
before the inspector?

363
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:10,545
Disrespectful man!

364
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:12,131
You hit my man!

365
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:16,735
I apologize to you for that.

366
00:30:17,057 --> 00:30:20,373
- But you have t say sorry to him.
- Leave my hand!

367
00:30:20,606 --> 00:30:23,194
I don't leave someone's
hand after I have caught it.

368
00:30:23,274 --> 00:30:25,121
I'll have your hands freed, sir.

369
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:27,858
But you will have
to ask for forgiveness.

370
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:32,104
- Sorry.
- Not like that. Like this.

371
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:35,088
Leave my hand.

372
00:30:36,762 --> 00:30:37,902
Forgive me.

373
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:42,768
Wow! That was fun.

374
00:30:43,171 --> 00:30:46,421
Today a man dared to fight with him.
Shake hands.

375
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:52,991
Sir, you had just said that..

376
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:55,271
You don't leave anyone's
hands on getting hold of it.

377
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:40,108
Sir, aren't you ashamed to
tease a young girl in broad daylight?

378
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,398
Girl, aren't you ashamed to
tease a young boy in broad daylight?

379
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:46,099
What? Have you ever heard..

380
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,673
That a young girl teases a young man?

381
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,420
You are the ones who do such mischief.

382
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,427
And this is the proof for
it which you used to hit me.

383
00:31:53,507 --> 00:31:56,999
- And the one you used to hit me?
- Don't try to lie.

384
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:58,626
Your truth has come out.

385
00:31:59,556 --> 00:32:01,424
You have thrown a net knowingly.

386
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:04,341
- Because you have fallen in love with me.
- Love?

387
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:06,494
This is all wrong, completely false.

388
00:32:06,711 --> 00:32:08,744
This is the truth.
I am looking at everything.

389
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:11,422
Your way has changed.
Your voice has changed.

390
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:13,747
- Your way of looking has changed.
- Shanno!

391
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:16,935
Sir, have you come
here for work or romance?

392
00:32:17,213 --> 00:32:18,825
I can't bear this.

393
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,914
I'll go right now and complain
to the owner right now.

394
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:25,245
- Don't do that.
- I will do so.

395
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:27,479
- I'll lose my job.
- What should I do then?

396
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,990
You should get punishment
for your doing.

397
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,485
Look, Shanno. Forgive me.
I swear to you..

398
00:32:31,526 --> 00:32:33,515
Whatever you have to say,
say it before the owner.

399
00:32:33,673 --> 00:32:35,866
- Now he will make your decision.
- Anand, Shanno!

400
00:32:36,158 --> 00:32:37,470
What is it? What happened?

401
00:32:38,637 --> 00:32:40,704
What decision do you want me to take?

402
00:32:41,105 --> 00:32:43,726
Sir, Anand has...

403
00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:45,901
What has he done?

404
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,564
He has done a lot.

405
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,724
Did Anand make a mistake?

406
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:53,440
He made a big mistake. Actually...

407
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:55,247
I was telling him that..

408
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:57,743
Half the goods should go today
and the other half tomorrow.

409
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,015
But he says that half goods should
go tomorrow and the other half today.

410
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:02,845
What?

411
00:33:04,794 --> 00:33:07,599
One half of the goods today
and the other half tomorrow.

412
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,809
Half of the goods tomorrow
and the other half today.

413
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:15,406
I have understood it. I understand.

414
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,127
Now listen, I have decided..

415
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:21,872
You two will work together
and take care of each other.

416
00:33:22,096 --> 00:33:23,775
You're right, sir. Thank you, sir.

417
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,070
So, inspector,
you were going to get me fired.

418
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:35,725
- Why didn't you complain about me?
- I felt pity on you.

419
00:33:35,905 --> 00:33:39,002
Why don't you say that you love me?

420
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:41,613
- Love?
- Yes.

421
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:44,283
Your truth has come out.
I can see everything.

422
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:48,070
Your way has changed.
Your voice has changed.

423
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:49,893
Your way of looking has changed.

424
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,651
This means that
you have fallen in love with me.

425
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,163
But I don't love you.

426
00:33:56,568 --> 00:34:00,040
I will love a girl
who has veil on her head.

427
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:04,271
She should have vermillion on her head.
She must have bangles on her hands.

428
00:34:04,863 --> 00:34:06,378
She should have shyness in her eyes.

429
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:08,889
She must be blushing
and be under control.

430
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,065
She should walk slowly..

431
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:15,025
And it should appear like there is
an anklet ringing far away.

432
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,571
But you don't have all this.

433
00:34:53,013 --> 00:34:56,267
'I will love a girl...'
- '...who has veil on her head.'

434
00:34:57,004 --> 00:35:00,514
'She should have vermillion on her head.
She must have bangles on her hands.'

435
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:03,193
'She should have shyness in her eyes.'

436
00:35:03,855 --> 00:35:07,325
'She must be blushing and be
under control. She should walk slowly..'

437
00:35:08,135 --> 00:35:11,713
'..and it should appear like
there is an anklet ringing far away.'

438
00:35:38,548 --> 00:35:44,247
"I was good but incomplete.
I got someone who was better than me."

439
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:50,503
"I was good but incomplete.
I got someone who was better than me."

440
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:54,103
"I have become his slave."

441
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:59,639
"I have become his slave."

442
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:05,048
"Salutations."

443
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:11,278
"Salutations."

444
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:36,193
"At least tell me when you will come
accompanied by a marriage procession?"

445
00:36:36,424 --> 00:36:42,370
"When will you make
your slave your wife?"

446
00:36:45,424 --> 00:36:51,203
"At least tell me when you will come
accompanied by a marriage procession?"

447
00:36:51,283 --> 00:36:56,462
"When will you make
your slave your wife?"

448
00:36:56,627 --> 00:37:02,566
"King of my heart,
I am very happy to have met you."

449
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:08,352
"King of my heart,
I am very happy to have met you."

450
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:12,180
"Come closer and make an agreement."

451
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:17,629
"Come closer and make an agreement."

452
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:23,340
"Salutations."

453
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:29,244
"Salutations."

454
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:50,617
"Very few people in
this world are like you."

455
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:56,351
"There are many small
personalities like me."

456
00:37:59,692 --> 00:38:05,295
"Very few people in
this world are like you."

457
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:10,524
"There are many small
personalities like me."

458
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:16,398
"Join two cards and break
the limits of this age."

459
00:38:16,582 --> 00:38:22,288
"Join two cards and break
the limits of this age."

460
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:25,935
"Let me get a reward."

461
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:31,487
"Let me get a reward."

462
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:37,142
"Salutations."

463
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:43,367
"Salutations."

464
00:39:03,271 --> 00:39:09,134
"Flowers got the treasures
of colours from the nature."

465
00:39:09,298 --> 00:39:14,876
"Give me the answer
of love with love."

466
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:24,003
"Flowers got the treasures
of colours from the nature."

467
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:29,116
"Give me the answer
of love with love."

468
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:35,157
"What are you thinking,
man with a heart? Embrace me now."

469
00:39:35,237 --> 00:39:39,090
"Take my hand and hold it."

470
00:39:40,906 --> 00:39:44,188
"Take my hand and hold it."

471
00:39:44,268 --> 00:39:49,692
"Salutations."

472
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:55,443
"I was good but incomplete.
I got someone who was better than me."

473
00:39:55,562 --> 00:40:01,224
"I was good but incomplete.
I got someone who was better than me."

474
00:40:01,444 --> 00:40:04,842
"I have become his slave."

475
00:40:07,098 --> 00:40:10,291
"I have become his slave."

476
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:16,010
"Salutations."

477
00:40:16,209 --> 00:40:21,204
"Salutations."

478
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:37,405
Anand, I just remembered this.

479
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:40,217
- Will 10000 crates be ready till tomorrow for export?
- Yes.

480
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:42,795
Good. Alright, I shall leave.

481
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:45,783
Sir!

482
00:40:52,448 --> 00:40:53,693
Denu, what happened to you?

483
00:40:53,764 --> 00:40:57,434
My goat went to Mr. Girdhari's garden.

484
00:40:57,523 --> 00:41:01,288
I went to take that goat, his men beat me
and made me into such a state..

485
00:41:01,486 --> 00:41:03,375
And they also took away my goat.

486
00:41:03,742 --> 00:41:06,916
- Go take him to a doctor quickly. Go!
- Alright, sir.

487
00:41:08,971 --> 00:41:11,212
Girdhari's actions
have disturbed me greatly.

488
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,595
- I don't know what to do.
- Who is Girdhari?

489
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:17,876
A rich ruffian!

490
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:21,934
He has illegally captured our gardens.

491
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:24,293
He isn't afraid of
the police or court.

492
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:26,808
Since the day I took him to court..

493
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:28,648
He has made our workers'
living miserable.

494
00:41:29,494 --> 00:41:32,496
I am frustrated, I am planning
to withdraw the complaint.

495
00:41:32,962 --> 00:41:37,506
No, not complaint
we will teach him a fitting lesson.

496
00:41:50,147 --> 00:41:53,604
Come, Mr. Diwan.

497
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,486
How did you come by?

498
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:02,041
I haven't come, I have been brought.

499
00:42:02,343 --> 00:42:03,961
He has come to meet you.

500
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:06,583
- Oh!
- He's our chief supervisor.

501
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:11,944
- Anand.
- I am very happy to meet you.

502
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:15,196
My name is Girdhari.

503
00:42:15,804 --> 00:42:18,140
Tell me, what can I do for you?

504
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,129
I have come in relation to the garden.

505
00:42:21,987 --> 00:42:25,736
I request you,
in presence of friendship..

506
00:42:26,491 --> 00:42:30,182
If this enmity would be finished,
it would be good.

507
00:42:31,656 --> 00:42:33,494
That is what I want too.

508
00:42:33,574 --> 00:42:38,883
The fights, problems, court,
are not for respectful people like us.

509
00:42:42,134 --> 00:42:45,357
Take this agreement and sign it then.

510
00:42:47,408 --> 00:42:48,408
Oh!

511
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:00,484
Girdhari, this humour isn't good.

512
00:43:01,124 --> 00:43:04,121
You will have to sign.

513
00:43:05,738 --> 00:43:07,255
On what?

514
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:16,531
On this.

515
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:19,516
Oh!

516
00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:38,852
Mr. Girdhari, didn't you hear?

517
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,914
This humour isn't good.

518
00:43:43,337 --> 00:43:48,447
You will have to sign.

519
00:44:04,502 --> 00:44:05,952
Wait!

520
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:10,405
A rat has attacked a tiger.

521
00:44:12,595 --> 00:44:16,718
I appreciate your courage.
Shake hands.

522
00:45:03,446 --> 00:45:06,317
Wait. We are both tired.

523
00:45:06,714 --> 00:45:10,798
I have a tablet that ceases tiredness.

524
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,065
Have it, I'll have it too. Here.

525
00:45:14,677 --> 00:45:17,961
We will both enjoy it.
You have one, I'll have another.

526
00:46:09,281 --> 00:46:12,013
- Come here!
- What are you doing?

527
00:46:12,482 --> 00:46:14,972
- Drink water.
- I won't drink this water.

528
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:21,906
In my rule, tigers and Denu's goats
drink water from the same source.

529
00:46:21,986 --> 00:46:24,668
- Drink.
- Make some other papers..

530
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,865
I'll make a signature
wherever you tell me to.

531
00:46:26,945 --> 00:46:32,753
- Go on, I'll wait for you.
- 'Waiting' is not in my dictionary.

532
00:46:33,748 --> 00:46:36,979
Here! Sign it! Take this pen!

533
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,483
Wow! Anand has done a great job.

534
00:46:52,864 --> 00:46:54,775
I couldn't do this for many years..

535
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:57,692
The court couldn't do this,
he did it in hours.

536
00:46:58,035 --> 00:46:59,646
Did Anand do it?

537
00:47:00,242 --> 00:47:01,883
It's my bad fate.

538
00:47:02,316 --> 00:47:05,799
It was the spices that did the work,
but daughter-in-law got credit for it.

539
00:47:06,105 --> 00:47:10,673
Sir, I thought that there
is justice in your home..

540
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:12,449
But today..

541
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:15,574
I have realised that there is not
justice in your home but sheer injustice.

542
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:19,570
- What do you mean?
- Chotelal's big mouth never emits lies.

543
00:47:19,965 --> 00:47:22,704
It's a secret sir,
don't let it out in the open.

544
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:27,333
If I wouldn't be there today,
Anand would not have returned alive.

545
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,952
When Girdharilal had
him cornered from all sides..

546
00:47:31,122 --> 00:47:35,681
I broke the barrier and
I screamed loudly, 'Girdhari'..

547
00:47:35,761 --> 00:47:38,540
Girdhari was scared and looked around..

548
00:47:39,472 --> 00:47:41,119
He said, 'who are you?'

549
00:47:41,456 --> 00:47:46,758
I told him, 'coward,
if you want to see me, look downward..'

550
00:47:47,286 --> 00:47:51,841
he looked at me with a bent neck,
I saw him with my neck upward..

551
00:47:52,897 --> 00:47:56,574
And then Girdhari used
his shaking hands..

552
00:47:57,072 --> 00:48:00,764
And shaking pen to sign
on a shaking paper.

553
00:48:01,426 --> 00:48:04,675
Sir, tell me what happened to Anand?

554
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:06,417
He was in a bad state.

555
00:48:06,828 --> 00:48:09,171
He was scared and hid in a box.

556
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:11,574
- He is still hiding.
- Did you see, sir?

557
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:14,216
It's not me, the whole world...

558
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:17,697
Anand, how are you? Are you okay?

559
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:22,589
- Are you hurt?
- Until you are here, how can I be hurt?

560
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:32,155
Anand, you rid us from a big problem.

561
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,217
For this, you are given a promotion.

562
00:48:35,644 --> 00:48:37,927
From today,
you are the manager of our firm.

563
00:48:38,846 --> 00:48:41,266
- Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.
- Bless you.

564
00:48:42,516 --> 00:48:44,621
Thank me.

565
00:48:44,701 --> 00:48:47,111
I requested for you to be promoted.

566
00:48:47,434 --> 00:48:50,407
Sir, it has been so many
years since you started working here..

567
00:48:50,622 --> 00:48:51,942
Why haven't you been promoted?

568
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:55,371
Servants get promoted, not owners.

569
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:06,649
Hello?

570
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,137
Anand, it's your telephone.

571
00:49:10,553 --> 00:49:13,767
- Hello?
- A manager from being a supervisor!

572
00:49:14,672 --> 00:49:21,807
Wow! On this promotion
accept Girdhari's congratulations..

573
00:49:23,396 --> 00:49:30,757
But don't forget that
I too have a part in your success.

574
00:49:31,837 --> 00:49:33,179
What do you want to say?

575
00:49:33,259 --> 00:49:35,959
We will get many opportunities
to say and listen.

576
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:43,872
All I know is that
Mr. Rai will pay for this.

577
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:47,603
Understand another thing.

578
00:49:59,406 --> 00:50:03,503
God, today is Rakesh's birthday.

579
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,676
Every mother is happy
on her son's birthday..

580
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,751
But I am very sad.

581
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:13,629
My son has lost his way.

582
00:50:15,314 --> 00:50:17,229
I pray to you, God..

583
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:23,070
Show my son the right way,
show my son the right way.

584
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:32,295
Sister, keep this tie from me.

585
00:50:32,736 --> 00:50:34,836
Ma'am, did you call me?

586
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:38,060
Gopal, do you know that brother
Rakesh has his birthday today?

587
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,789
Yes, how could I forget that?

588
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:45,363
Take this packet
and hand it over only to brother.

589
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:48,345
- Don't give it to anyone else.
- Alright.

590
00:50:49,854 --> 00:50:52,404
- Gopal, where are you going?
- To master.

591
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:56,135
Today he has his birthday
the children have given this for him.

592
00:50:56,336 --> 00:50:57,617
Show it to me.

593
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:00,583
Wow! That's a good sweater.

594
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,435
What's this?

595
00:51:02,942 --> 00:51:04,292
'Happy birthday, brother.'

596
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:08,015
'We use to celebrate
today's day so well together..'

597
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,644
'..but today, there isn't anything.'

598
00:51:12,572 --> 00:51:14,156
'I feel so lonely.'

599
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,850
'Brother,
you have completely forgotten us..'

600
00:51:18,794 --> 00:51:20,033
'..but we didn't forget you.'

601
00:51:21,336 --> 00:51:23,633
'Accept this small gift
from your brother and sister.'

602
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:26,305
'Ashu, Raju.'

603
00:51:30,044 --> 00:51:34,234
Raju, Ashu. Don't feel bad.

604
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:37,600
Like every year, Rakesh's
birthday will be celebrated here..

605
00:51:38,293 --> 00:51:40,459
And you will give these
gifts to your brother.

606
00:51:40,871 --> 00:51:43,130
Make preparations, I'll get him.

607
00:51:52,572 --> 00:51:56,172
"Happy birthday to you!"

608
00:51:56,331 --> 00:52:00,024
- "Happy birthday to you!"
- Come, have this.

609
00:52:00,104 --> 00:52:02,809
- Cheers!
- Let's have some music! Come on!

610
00:52:02,889 --> 00:52:04,346
Come on!

611
00:52:05,828 --> 00:52:07,803
Let's dance everybody! Come on!

612
00:52:09,157 --> 00:52:10,404
Cheers!

613
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:24,951
Happy birthday, Mr. Rakesh.

614
00:52:26,283 --> 00:52:28,402
Why did you show your
damned face in my house?

615
00:52:28,768 --> 00:52:31,243
- I have come to take you.
- You have come to take me?

616
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:34,242
On whose order?

617
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:35,902
This request is mine, Mr. Rakesh.

618
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:38,155
Come for a short while..

619
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:42,301
Your brother and sister are
anxiously anticipating your coming.

620
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,246
You are daddy's servant..

621
00:52:44,499 --> 00:52:47,163
Who are you to interfere
in our personal matter?

622
00:52:47,392 --> 00:52:51,785
I am an outsider but you
should come for your people.

623
00:52:51,865 --> 00:52:54,232
Shut up and get lost!

624
00:53:00,793 --> 00:53:03,015
I won't go alone.

625
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:08,087
Pannalal, he won't go alone.

626
00:53:19,206 --> 00:53:21,006
Come. Come on!

627
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:31,319
Mother, brother has come.

628
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,835
- Rakesh, you came?
- I didn't come, I have been brought here.

629
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:43,545
I ask you how did this worthless
man dare to enter my home?

630
00:53:44,895 --> 00:53:47,735
How did this ruffian
picked up from the streets..

631
00:53:48,035 --> 00:53:50,379
Dare to ruin my birthday party?

632
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,742
All this has happened
due to you people.

633
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:56,319
You have given him support,
you have vitiated him!

634
00:53:57,381 --> 00:54:00,449
Otherwise how would
a man whom we feed..

635
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:03,599
- Dare to insult me among many people.
- Rakesh!

636
00:54:03,968 --> 00:54:06,711
Are you satisfied
by having me insulted?

637
00:54:06,954 --> 00:54:09,235
You removed me from your heart.
Removed me from our home..

638
00:54:09,418 --> 00:54:11,352
You are not interested in my happiness..

639
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:13,296
You don't have any
sympathy for my sadness..

640
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,518
Why did you need to
celebrate my birthday?

641
00:54:15,622 --> 00:54:17,436
It was not needed!

642
00:54:19,488 --> 00:54:24,533
I don't want a candle of
your name to burn in my home.

643
00:54:25,271 --> 00:54:27,176
It was their mistake,
their stubbornness..

644
00:54:27,663 --> 00:54:30,710
They were asking for love
and happiness from a person like you.

645
00:54:31,004 --> 00:54:32,791
I'll have their happiness completed.

646
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:41,766
Congratulations to
you people on my birthday!

647
00:55:48,415 --> 00:55:50,396
Sir, could you tell me this address?

648
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:56,179
Wait.

649
00:55:59,545 --> 00:56:02,658
Sir, you had come for my birthday..

650
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,614
But I couldn't serve you anything
and I regret that.

651
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:08,743
Today we will celebrate your birthday..

652
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,330
And I'll give you such a present..

653
00:56:10,371 --> 00:56:13,775
Through which you will remember me
on your every birthday!

654
00:56:18,805 --> 00:56:21,885
Why are you showing your bravery
with the help of your servants?

655
00:56:22,558 --> 00:56:25,045
I can give you such a
present which will make you..

656
00:56:25,439 --> 00:56:29,198
Remember today's day
till the day of your death!

657
00:56:29,814 --> 00:56:33,990
The hands that rise against
me are always broken.

658
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:10,809
Shanno?

659
00:57:34,942 --> 00:57:35,942
Anand!

660
00:57:37,061 --> 00:57:38,242
Anand!

661
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,172
Anand!

662
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:53,287
Anand!

663
00:57:54,627 --> 00:57:55,771
Anand!

664
00:58:19,031 --> 00:58:20,812
Anand!

665
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:23,240
Anand, don't spare him today!

666
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:27,686
He must know that someone who
can retaliate to his cruelty is born!

667
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,294
Teach him such a lesson that..

668
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:32,286
He shouldn't be able to
raise his hand again.

669
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:37,532
He must know what pain
is and what a wound is.

670
00:58:38,052 --> 00:58:40,199
Don't spare him, kill him.

671
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:48,618
I feel like mortally wounding you
but I am helpless.

672
00:58:49,631 --> 00:58:53,652
You are that man's son, whom I revere..

673
00:58:54,074 --> 00:58:57,552
You are that mother's
son who is like my mother.

674
00:58:57,852 --> 00:58:58,940
Get lost!

675
00:59:02,082 --> 00:59:03,178
Come.

676
00:59:11,157 --> 00:59:12,713
I'll get warm water.

677
00:59:19,275 --> 00:59:20,325
Mr. Rai?

678
00:59:24,086 --> 00:59:26,177
What brings you here?

679
00:59:27,114 --> 00:59:29,284
If there was an important,
you should have called me.

680
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:33,433
It was duty to come to you.

681
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,696
Anand.

682
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:40,605
- I am here to apologise to you.
- What?

683
00:59:42,053 --> 00:59:43,951
Rakesh didn't attack you..

684
00:59:45,578 --> 00:59:47,515
- He has hit me.
- Mr. Rai!

685
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:49,402
Anand.

686
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:54,367
Due to my son's evil
deeds my fate has changed.

687
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:00,321
It looks as if I have
a debt from the last life..

688
01:00:01,595 --> 01:00:06,179
I am repaying it in the form of
apologies and shame.

689
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:10,502
Forgive me.

690
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:23,533
Even though the owner is so rich,
he looked so poor.

691
01:00:24,648 --> 01:00:27,545
What did Rakesh give
to his parents and siblings?

692
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:32,164
God gave them everything
but kept back one.

693
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,455
It is called happiness..

694
01:00:35,962 --> 01:00:38,362
And there is no one in this
house who can bring happiness.

695
01:01:28,877 --> 01:01:30,293
Are you fooling me?

696
01:01:56,372 --> 01:01:57,628
- Me.
- Yes.

697
01:02:32,302 --> 01:02:33,479
Brother!

698
01:02:55,092 --> 01:03:03,092
"My dear sister, darling sister."

699
01:03:04,835 --> 01:03:12,835
"While I am here,
don't be immersed in tears."

700
01:03:14,377 --> 01:03:22,377
"I agree to what you say,
say it again."

701
01:03:23,335 --> 01:03:31,335
"My dear sister, darling sister."

702
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:04,386
"I don't know what good deeds I did."

703
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:11,553
"I received this house
which is like a temple."

704
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:18,373
"The day you came into this house."

705
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:25,172
"This house really
turned into a temple."

706
01:04:25,244 --> 01:04:27,969
- "Do you swear by me?
- I do."

707
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:32,732
"I wish to stay only here now."

708
01:04:32,812 --> 01:04:37,519
"Say it again."

709
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:45,599
"My dear sister, darling sister."

710
01:05:06,993 --> 01:05:13,659
"Give me all work that is incomplete."

711
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:21,080
"See dreams,
I'll have them completed."

712
01:05:21,638 --> 01:05:27,645
"You must be the dream
of every mother and father."

713
01:05:28,051 --> 01:05:34,253
"There won't be anyone dear like you."

714
01:05:34,445 --> 01:05:37,150
- "Do you swear by me?
- I do."

715
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:42,061
"I will forever agree to your saying."

716
01:05:42,141 --> 01:05:46,620
"Say it again."

717
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:54,700
- "Sister."
- "I am your dear one, your darling sister."

718
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:04,700
"While I am here,
don't be immersed in tears."

719
01:06:05,756 --> 01:06:13,756
"I agree to what you say.
I don't want to stay without you."

720
01:06:14,352 --> 01:06:22,352
"My dear sister, darling sister."

721
01:06:59,158 --> 01:07:03,827
God, I haven't asked for anything
from You for myself till today.

722
01:07:04,864 --> 01:07:06,597
Today, I ask for my sister's feet.

723
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,926
She has a mountain
like life before her.

724
01:07:11,084 --> 01:07:15,331
Take my feet but give
my sister a new life.

725
01:07:16,302 --> 01:07:17,698
If I see her walking..

726
01:07:19,441 --> 01:07:20,774
My life will be a successful.

727
01:07:22,175 --> 01:07:24,890
Have mercy on her, God! Have mercy!

728
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,789
Have mercy on her!

729
01:07:39,621 --> 01:07:40,877
My dear...

730
01:07:45,743 --> 01:07:46,877
Shobha...

731
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:49,811
God has listened to us.

732
01:07:50,937 --> 01:07:52,352
Today, we have found a son.

733
01:07:57,313 --> 01:07:58,972
Well done.

734
01:07:59,984 --> 01:08:03,266
You have made such a drama.
You have acted so well.

735
01:08:04,369 --> 01:08:06,958
Today, we have succeeded in my scheme.

736
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,972
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

737
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:13,019
You are the one who is responsible
for this scheme's success, boss.

738
01:08:14,396 --> 01:08:17,774
- Cheers!
- But my boy..

739
01:08:18,332 --> 01:08:21,472
The wonder that you have shown,
it is remarkable.

740
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,599
You have made a net of emotions.

741
01:08:23,764 --> 01:08:26,629
Now, Mr. Rai's family
cannot escape the trap.

742
01:08:27,341 --> 01:08:29,975
Mr. and Mrs. Rai are in my control.

743
01:08:30,237 --> 01:08:32,731
I have become their
children's real brother.

744
01:08:34,131 --> 01:08:38,525
I have fooled them so well
that they have all become blind.

745
01:08:38,957 --> 01:08:42,837
When I'll clear all the stuff there,
they'll see the light.

746
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:55,939
Oh my God! For reaching till here,
I had to do a lot of drama.

747
01:08:59,224 --> 01:09:01,324
'Here, make your signature.'

748
01:09:02,712 --> 01:09:06,872
- I'm sorry, boss!
- Lightly!

749
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:09,970
I'm still in pain.

750
01:09:15,211 --> 01:09:20,985
Now there mustn't be
a long time to reach the goal.

751
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:25,503
My innocent boss!

752
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,615
I have reached till their hearts..

753
01:09:28,925 --> 01:09:33,042
How much more time could it
take to reach their treasure?

754
01:09:33,122 --> 01:09:34,535
Cheers!

755
01:09:44,553 --> 01:09:46,241
Diwan uncle has come, should I...

756
01:09:47,629 --> 01:09:49,626
- Hi, uncle!
- Hi?

757
01:09:49,973 --> 01:09:52,233
Child, are you alright?

758
01:09:52,395 --> 01:09:55,252
- Why are you moaning?
- Uncle, you are a big bore.

759
01:09:55,332 --> 01:09:58,402
Thank you, child. Once more.

760
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,007
Do you know what Ashu is calling you?

761
01:10:01,195 --> 01:10:03,510
What is she saying?
She is praising me, what else?

762
01:10:03,819 --> 01:10:07,381
Sir, agree that you
don't know English.

763
01:10:10,343 --> 01:10:11,731
I don't know English?

764
01:10:12,434 --> 01:10:14,853
I have learnt English
from the English.

765
01:10:15,498 --> 01:10:21,121
But there was a time when the
English had to learn English from me.

766
01:10:22,123 --> 01:10:24,368
They use to walk miles and come to me..

767
01:10:24,673 --> 01:10:29,060
To get Hindi translated
into English and vice versa.

768
01:10:31,746 --> 01:10:33,426
- So then, let's have a translation.
- Yes.

769
01:10:33,564 --> 01:10:35,224
- Make its English form.
- I'll make it.

770
01:10:35,434 --> 01:10:37,408
'You and I are shut in a room.'

771
01:10:38,444 --> 01:10:40,183
You, I, one room closed.

772
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:42,714
'And the key should be lost.'

773
01:10:42,794 --> 01:10:43,924
And key loses.

774
01:10:44,581 --> 01:10:47,299
Wow! Diwan Chotelal, you are great!

775
01:10:47,774 --> 01:10:50,703
English is alive in this
country only due to you.

776
01:10:50,912 --> 01:10:52,456
Thank you, sir.

777
01:10:53,337 --> 01:10:55,817
- Anand hasn't come from office yet?
- He has gone to the city.

778
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:57,441
He said he has some important task.

779
01:10:57,912 --> 01:10:59,515
The poor guy has to do a lot of work.

780
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,983
- "There is liquor.
- Yes, there is liquor."

781
01:11:42,024 --> 01:11:44,588
- "There is youthfulness.
- Yes, there is youthfulness."

782
01:11:44,629 --> 01:11:48,374
"They are all fantastic."

783
01:11:48,688 --> 01:11:50,385
"It is fantastic."

784
01:11:50,426 --> 01:11:53,824
"Crazy heart, tell me."

785
01:11:54,087 --> 01:11:57,630
"What else do you want?"

786
01:11:57,912 --> 01:11:59,654
"What do you want?"

787
01:11:59,734 --> 01:12:04,342
"Crazy heart, tell me."

788
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,057
"What else do you want?"

789
01:12:08,259 --> 01:12:10,712
"What do you want?"

790
01:12:10,913 --> 01:12:13,464
- "There is liquor.
- Yes, there is liquor."

791
01:12:13,505 --> 01:12:16,227
- "There is youthfulness.
- Yes, there is youthfulness."

792
01:12:48,237 --> 01:12:53,201
"Unkind thing, I have fulfilled
all your persistence."

793
01:12:53,242 --> 01:12:56,066
"O crazy heart."

794
01:12:56,223 --> 01:13:01,123
"Everyone that you loved,
I loved her too."

795
01:13:03,734 --> 01:13:08,659
"I went everywhere you told me to.
I passed through every mission."

796
01:13:11,399 --> 01:13:15,368
"I listen only to you, tell me."

797
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:21,079
"What else do you want?
What do you want?"

798
01:13:22,254 --> 01:13:25,849
"You crazy thing, tell us."

799
01:13:25,929 --> 01:13:32,023
"What else do you want?
What do you want?"

800
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:50,063
"If the Sheikh touches the grape,
I'll reveal it to everyone."

801
01:13:50,623 --> 01:13:52,747
"To everyone."

802
01:13:52,788 --> 01:13:57,894
"He used to eat sweet tablets,
I would drink through the sea."

803
01:13:57,958 --> 01:14:01,379
- "This is that liquor.
- Yes, it is liquor."

804
01:14:01,475 --> 01:14:03,974
- "There is youthfulness.
- Yes, there is youthfulness."

805
01:14:04,015 --> 01:14:07,809
"They are all fantastic."

806
01:14:08,105 --> 01:14:09,628
"It is fantastic."

807
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:13,144
"Crazy heart, tell me."

808
01:14:13,224 --> 01:14:16,880
"What else do you want?"

809
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,989
"What do you want?"

810
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:23,442
"Crazy heart, tell me."

811
01:14:23,647 --> 01:14:29,777
"What else do you want?
What do you want?"

812
01:14:56,389 --> 01:15:01,311
"Drink the booze that
comes out of darling's eyes."

813
01:15:01,352 --> 01:15:04,038
"O crazy heart."

814
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:08,935
"The world may think as it wants to,
you should live as you want to."

815
01:15:11,767 --> 01:15:16,897
"There is no objection, there is no shame,
don't hide your condition."

816
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,722
"Don't give me excuses."

817
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:29,495
"Tell me, what else do you want?
What do you want?"

818
01:15:30,004 --> 01:15:33,698
"O crazy heart, tell me."

819
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:39,484
"What else do you want?
What do you want?"

820
01:15:55,995 --> 01:16:03,995
"The statues of Ajanta
are dancing merrily."

821
01:16:06,524 --> 01:16:14,524
"In innocent ways are hidden
such attractive faces."

822
01:16:16,178 --> 01:16:21,276
"Here is a gathering of fairies,
there is a meeting of beauties."

823
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:26,870
"Here, I wish to die,
there I wish to live."

824
01:16:27,733 --> 01:16:31,178
"Tell me where do I live."

825
01:16:31,265 --> 01:16:36,898
"What else do you want?
What do you want?"

826
01:16:37,953 --> 01:16:41,535
"O crazy heart, tell me."

827
01:16:41,576 --> 01:16:46,978
"What else do you want?
What do you want?"

828
01:16:47,071 --> 01:16:52,506
"What do you want? What do you want?"

829
01:16:52,921 --> 01:17:00,035
"What do you want?"

830
01:17:00,308 --> 01:17:01,308
Anand?

831
01:17:03,729 --> 01:17:04,730
Anand.

832
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:13,748
You are very cruel. You woke me
and broke connections of hearts.

833
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:17,468
I was seeing such a beautiful dream.

834
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:21,996
My boy, leave those dreams
and come into the world of reality.

835
01:17:22,843 --> 01:17:26,275
Don't forget that
now you are not alone in this world.

836
01:17:26,495 --> 01:17:30,010
- You have a mother, father, brother...
- Leave that!

837
01:17:30,909 --> 01:17:33,099
Say something to make up a mood.

838
01:17:33,773 --> 01:17:36,058
- Let's have a drink. Come.
- No!

839
01:17:36,727 --> 01:17:39,115
You have your whole life for that.

840
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:42,270
Duty is duty.

841
01:17:42,965 --> 01:17:46,549
Go, your family is waiting for you.

842
01:17:51,253 --> 01:17:54,124
- Go on.
- Alright.

843
01:18:01,729 --> 01:18:04,847
- Anand, should I set food on the table?
- I have had my food.

844
01:18:10,753 --> 01:18:12,439
Ashu and Raju are here?

845
01:18:12,784 --> 01:18:15,963
They waited for you and fell asleep.
They didn't even have their food.

846
01:18:17,241 --> 01:18:18,995
- Get the food. Here.
- Okay.

847
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:24,157
Raju.

848
01:18:26,156 --> 01:18:28,370
Ashu. Ashu get up.

849
01:18:30,371 --> 01:18:33,233
What is this?
Why didn't you have dinner?

850
01:18:33,606 --> 01:18:35,375
Since you came here, brother..

851
01:18:35,647 --> 01:18:38,419
Has it ever happened
that we had food without you?

852
01:18:40,732 --> 01:18:46,012
Okay. This will never happen again.
Okay? I'm sorry.

853
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:51,280
Mother, daddy, brother has come.
Come on for eating food.

854
01:18:53,892 --> 01:18:57,546
You people are strange.
You have acted like these children.

855
01:18:57,690 --> 01:18:58,862
Look, Anand.

856
01:18:58,903 --> 01:19:01,146
The truth is that I am
feeling very hungry.

857
01:19:01,607 --> 01:19:03,643
Sit down. I was going to eat..

858
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:06,137
When I saw that children
were on a hunger strike.

859
01:19:06,481 --> 01:19:07,852
I talked to these children's mother..

860
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,801
I found that even
she has a hunger strike.

861
01:19:10,075 --> 01:19:12,149
I was ashamed.
The morsel remained in my hands..

862
01:19:12,229 --> 01:19:15,827
And even the father of these children
went on a hunger strike.

863
01:19:16,847 --> 01:19:20,141
Anand, you know what?

864
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:24,586
Even if I had food without you,
it wouldn't have satiated my hunger.

865
01:19:29,087 --> 01:19:33,130
Shanno, why are you angry with me?
What is it?

866
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:35,781
The thing is that
I have found your truth.

867
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,027
- Truth?
- Yes.

868
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:42,533
You are a cheat!
You are a betrayer! A thief! A stealer!

869
01:19:42,805 --> 01:19:45,565
- What are you saying?
- I am right.

870
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:49,989
You stole my sleep,
you stole my heart, of a poor girl..

871
01:19:50,589 --> 01:19:53,783
You trapped me in the net
of your love and cheated me.

872
01:19:56,577 --> 01:20:01,031
What has happened to you?
Why are you talking like this today?

873
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:05,358
I have met you today after so many days.
You have become a big man.

874
01:20:07,404 --> 01:20:10,394
Staying in palaces, why would
you remember people who stay in huts?

875
01:20:11,231 --> 01:20:13,925
I understood it.
So that's why you are angry?

876
01:20:14,005 --> 01:20:16,840
Big people understand unimportant
people's words a little late.

877
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:21,582
- Shanno, don't you trust me?
- Absolutely not.

878
01:20:23,582 --> 01:20:24,787
You shouldn't have any.

879
01:20:26,481 --> 01:20:32,980
It's true, Shanno. I am a cheater,
I am a betrayer, a thief and a stealer.

880
01:20:34,254 --> 01:20:40,246
Tell me. Even after knowing
all this would you love me?

881
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:46,958
Yes, I will. I will always do, Anand.

882
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:50,949
However you may be you are mine
and forever you will be mine.

883
01:21:03,095 --> 01:21:06,851
Chotelal, I want Rs. 10,000 right now.

884
01:21:07,337 --> 01:21:09,795
Prepare a cheque quickly
and get it signed from daddy.

885
01:21:09,936 --> 01:21:15,115
Sir, that department has now
been handed by the owner to Anand.

886
01:21:15,347 --> 01:21:19,405
Now the owner doesn't sign the cheque,
Anand does.

887
01:21:19,852 --> 01:21:23,037
What? That scoundrel
has turned into the owner?

888
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:25,395
Well, you are the actual owner.

889
01:21:25,615 --> 01:21:30,775
Forget about Rs. 10,000, you may take
Rs. 20,000. Go and take it from him.

890
01:21:32,862 --> 01:21:36,043
'I want Rs. 10,000 rupees.'
Is it your father's money?

891
01:21:41,033 --> 01:21:43,050
Come, Mr. Rakesh. Have a seat.

892
01:21:43,254 --> 01:21:46,344
I haven't come to sit.
I want Rs. 10,000.

893
01:21:46,707 --> 01:21:49,954
I have already kept your
monthly cheque of Rs. 5000 ready.

894
01:21:50,599 --> 01:21:51,925
Take it.

895
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:56,312
- I want Rs. 5000 more.
- But in which account?

896
01:21:56,432 --> 01:21:58,897
- I don't know that.
- Then I can't give it to you.

897
01:21:59,229 --> 01:22:01,662
You will have to give it.
I am ordering you.

898
01:22:02,054 --> 01:22:07,185
- I request you.
- Don't forget that you are my servant.

899
01:22:09,795 --> 01:22:11,352
I am the company's servant..

900
01:22:12,462 --> 01:22:16,410
And I can't go against
the company's rules and laws.

901
01:22:18,038 --> 01:22:20,575
I'm sorry. You may leave.

902
01:22:34,752 --> 01:22:37,512
I will have to remove
this thorn's obstacle.

903
01:22:40,073 --> 01:22:48,073
Pannalal, that scoundrel won't
see tomorrow's sun in our factory.

904
01:22:56,672 --> 01:22:59,563
Hello? Garry.

905
01:23:01,245 --> 01:23:04,198
I'm Rakesh speaking.

906
01:23:05,233 --> 01:23:08,617
This amount of 2 lakhs has just been
given by our contractor, Mr. Khanna.

907
01:23:09,874 --> 01:23:12,280
The bank must have been closed.
Alright, I'll take it home.

908
01:23:12,627 --> 01:23:14,816
It is not right to keep
such a big amount at home.

909
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,290
There is still some time. I'll go to the
city and have it deposited in bank.

910
01:23:19,509 --> 01:23:20,757
As you like.

911
01:23:50,872 --> 01:23:52,072
Is someone here?

912
01:23:55,345 --> 01:23:57,762
There was neither driver
in the truck nor cleaner.

913
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:00,547
As soon as I turned,
the bag was missing

914
01:24:01,017 --> 01:24:03,574
I looked around but
I couldn't see anyone.

915
01:24:03,865 --> 01:24:06,711
Such a big amount, I don't know...

916
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:14,523
Don't worry, Anand.
Do this, report to the police.

917
01:24:14,968 --> 01:24:16,775
Anand, when did this incident
take place?

918
01:24:16,816 --> 01:24:18,810
Around 4.

919
01:24:19,482 --> 01:24:22,991
Around 4? I saw you at
that time going to Shanno's home.

920
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:28,227
- What? What are you saying?
- Strange. I even saluted you..

921
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:29,683
But I don't know
what you were thinking about.

922
01:24:29,707 --> 01:24:33,242
- What is this nonsense?
- You are lying. Get out of here. - No.

923
01:24:34,017 --> 01:24:37,128
The doubt that he has created,
I'll clear it.

924
01:24:37,343 --> 01:24:39,839
- Come with me. Come!
- Come.

925
01:24:44,603 --> 01:24:46,905
All of you have come here? What is it?

926
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,851
We have to search your home, Shanno.

927
01:24:51,018 --> 01:24:53,921
- Our home's search?
- Not your search, it's mine.

928
01:24:54,373 --> 01:24:56,573
Some people think that
I came to your home today..

929
01:24:56,903 --> 01:24:59,063
And I have hidden the
company's money at your place.

930
01:24:59,244 --> 01:25:01,842
But, you haven't
come since many days.

931
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:03,929
Let him have a search.

932
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:05,740
- Go.
- Go!

933
01:25:20,493 --> 01:25:23,007
- Diwan. - Yes?
- Look at this.

934
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:29,711
Sir, we have found the money.

935
01:25:34,893 --> 01:25:36,615
But how did this bag come in our home?

936
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:40,536
This is all a lie. It is a conspiracy.

937
01:25:41,435 --> 01:25:44,339
- Such a big lie?
- Such a big fraud?

938
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:47,918
- Is Anand such a man?
- I had doubts earlier.

939
01:25:48,545 --> 01:25:50,129
I was certain.

940
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:52,919
One day this would happen.

941
01:25:53,951 --> 01:25:56,951
Now you will see what happens ahead.

942
01:25:57,959 --> 01:26:03,266
Daddy, have more trust on this cheat,
embrace him more.

943
01:26:03,524 --> 01:26:07,779
Listen to me. Hand him your property
and you both should go to Haridwar.

944
01:26:08,087 --> 01:26:11,964
Send Raju and Ashu to an orphanage
and I am already an orphan.

945
01:26:14,996 --> 01:26:18,744
You scoundrel!
How will you hide yourself now?

946
01:26:19,456 --> 01:26:21,346
You have been exposed.

947
01:26:21,813 --> 01:26:23,322
You have had a lot of fun..

948
01:26:23,363 --> 01:26:25,202
- Now you will suffer in jail!
- Save me!

949
01:26:25,321 --> 01:26:29,162
- Save me! - I'll thrash you to pulp!
- Save me!

950
01:26:29,242 --> 01:26:30,835
- You scoundrel!
- Save me!

951
01:26:30,923 --> 01:26:33,745
- Save me!
- Karan, why are you hitting him?

952
01:26:33,977 --> 01:26:36,880
Not only me,
all of you will hit him together now.

953
01:26:37,042 --> 01:26:39,308
He was giving liquor in his den..

954
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:41,755
And he was throwing
these 100's currency.

955
01:26:43,491 --> 01:26:47,137
From where have these notes come?
Tell me what you were saying in the den.

956
01:26:47,689 --> 01:26:51,896
- Tell me, whose name were you taking?
- Hail Rakesh.

957
01:26:52,164 --> 01:26:57,242
Sir, who pays Rs. 5000
for a task worth Rs. 5?

958
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:03,324
To stop a truck, lift a bag
and keep the bag at Shanno's home.

959
01:27:03,867 --> 01:27:06,078
Live long, Rakesh!

960
01:27:06,119 --> 01:27:08,210
You are a great kind man, sir!

961
01:27:08,251 --> 01:27:10,734
This scoundrel is lying
while he is drunk.

962
01:27:10,915 --> 01:27:14,095
Sir, a man always says
the truth when he is drunk.

963
01:27:14,252 --> 01:27:16,530
There are Rs. 5000 less in this bag.

964
01:27:21,107 --> 01:27:25,561
I couldn't even think that
you would do something so cheap!

965
01:27:25,893 --> 01:27:29,693
Didn't you have shame while
tricking this innocent man?

966
01:27:29,964 --> 01:27:32,979
Rakesh, the stone that
you lifted against him..

967
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:35,318
It has become a mark on your head.

968
01:27:36,488 --> 01:27:38,073
You shameless fellow!

969
01:27:39,283 --> 01:27:44,391
He who thought your siblings to be his..

970
01:27:45,604 --> 01:27:48,069
He was a support
to your parents support..

971
01:27:48,312 --> 01:27:50,015
You want to ruin him?

972
01:27:51,753 --> 01:27:53,375
We were dying in every moment..

973
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,487
Now there was a reason to live..

974
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,420
You couldn't even see that.

975
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,703
You have already taken everything.

976
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:05,712
The gift of love and
faith that we had got from God..

977
01:28:06,689 --> 01:28:10,794
You wanted to steal that too
and make us beggars? Isn't that so?

978
01:28:19,237 --> 01:28:20,256
Dear...

979
01:28:22,358 --> 01:28:23,785
Forgive us.

980
01:28:25,244 --> 01:28:26,921
Forgive us.

981
01:28:27,953 --> 01:28:29,539
We misunderstood you.

982
01:28:32,144 --> 01:28:33,767
Garry, what happened?

983
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:35,815
I trusted you and gave you this job..

984
01:28:36,013 --> 01:28:37,421
But you foiled my plan.

985
01:28:37,504 --> 01:28:39,415
I'm ruined, I'm doomed.

986
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,716
Rakesh, I am myself very disturbed.

987
01:28:42,756 --> 01:28:44,930
Till today,
none of my plans have failed.

988
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:51,232
That truck driver drank liquor
and foiled a well-made plan.

989
01:28:52,591 --> 01:28:55,475
I'll bury him alive.

990
01:28:55,678 --> 01:28:57,470
But what about me now?

991
01:28:57,511 --> 01:29:02,455
Don't worry. Trust my friendship.

992
01:29:03,399 --> 01:29:06,257
If I am alive such 1000
opportunities will come.

993
01:29:10,986 --> 01:29:14,227
It was good that your enemy..

994
01:29:14,505 --> 01:29:17,579
Came to your guru
to have you destroyed..

995
01:29:17,766 --> 01:29:21,569
And guru changed the situation
in such a way that he was upturned.

996
01:29:22,233 --> 01:29:24,072
You have been positioned forever.

997
01:29:24,856 --> 01:29:28,911
But Anand, this doesn't mean that
the danger has passed.

998
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:32,770
Now, you'll have to
be more careful with Rakesh.

999
01:29:33,342 --> 01:29:38,194
I would say that you should complete
this task as early as possible.

1000
01:29:44,001 --> 01:29:45,287
Anand...

1001
01:29:47,653 --> 01:29:49,900
yesterday's incident has shaken me.

1002
01:29:52,695 --> 01:29:54,065
I feel broken.

1003
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:57,973
God has saved you.

1004
01:29:59,117 --> 01:30:00,804
Otherwise, we would have lost you.

1005
01:30:02,333 --> 01:30:06,491
Today you are a big support for us.

1006
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:10,501
We are all living
supported by each other.

1007
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:13,598
No one knows..

1008
01:30:15,016 --> 01:30:16,381
When a support will be lost.

1009
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:20,390
Before time plays any more games..

1010
01:30:24,264 --> 01:30:26,283
I want to hand you
all my responsibility.

1011
01:30:26,955 --> 01:30:27,964
Come with me.

1012
01:30:34,941 --> 01:30:35,941
Come.

1013
01:31:00,527 --> 01:31:01,578
Anand...

1014
01:31:02,911 --> 01:31:04,763
This is our small treasure.

1015
01:31:05,846 --> 01:31:09,360
No one knows about it other than us.

1016
01:31:09,802 --> 01:31:13,772
And Rakesh doesn't deserve
to be brought here by us.

1017
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:20,099
Anand, this jewellery
that you see is expensive..

1018
01:31:20,947 --> 01:31:23,576
But among them a priceless thing is,
this statue.

1019
01:31:29,975 --> 01:31:32,938
Our emotions are attached towards it.

1020
01:31:33,726 --> 01:31:37,181
It is our family's respect
and a symbol from our ancestors.

1021
01:31:37,431 --> 01:31:39,263
We love it more than our lives.

1022
01:31:39,383 --> 01:31:44,448
Anand, this is our asset.
From today, you will take care of it.

1023
01:32:01,431 --> 01:32:04,939
It was my search for many years.

1024
01:32:05,434 --> 01:32:11,864
Goddess, I have seen you.
Now, open the doors to my fate.

1025
01:32:14,608 --> 01:32:17,489
Nandlal, is there any difference
between this one and that?

1026
01:32:18,119 --> 01:32:19,803
There is a difference.

1027
01:32:19,844 --> 01:32:22,750
This is a fake, and that one is real.

1028
01:32:23,519 --> 01:32:27,187
- Oh!
- Don't worry Mr. Girdhari.

1029
01:32:27,795 --> 01:32:29,778
Many years ago..

1030
01:32:29,858 --> 01:32:33,719
I had made that statue for
Mr. Rai's father and given it to him.

1031
01:32:33,876 --> 01:32:36,486
Live long!

1032
01:32:36,724 --> 01:32:43,011
I don't know whether to
call you Nandlal, Nand or Nandu.

1033
01:32:43,978 --> 01:32:49,411
It appears as
if you were alive for this day.

1034
01:32:57,233 --> 01:32:59,903
It must be the same doctor, 100/180.

1035
01:32:59,944 --> 01:33:04,207
No. You have made more progress,
110/190.

1036
01:33:04,867 --> 01:33:06,750
And the reward for this is that now..

1037
01:33:07,126 --> 01:33:11,109
You will have to rest
and forget about going to Delhi.

1038
01:33:11,214 --> 01:33:14,172
What would you doctors
lose by giving orders?

1039
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:18,062
For your information, if I don't go
to Delhi from today's flight..

1040
01:33:18,135 --> 01:33:20,341
- There will be a loss amounting in lakhs!
- Let it be!

1041
01:33:20,633 --> 01:33:22,628
- You won't go.
- I'll go to Delhi.

1042
01:33:22,939 --> 01:33:24,832
No brother, you can't go.

1043
01:33:28,831 --> 01:33:30,870
- Why?
- Tomorrow is Raksha-bandhan.

1044
01:33:31,424 --> 01:33:35,196
For the first time this sister
will tie a Rakhi to her brother.

1045
01:33:35,913 --> 01:33:38,843
Ashu, my departure is very important.

1046
01:33:39,424 --> 01:33:43,125
No brother, this is the first happiness of
a sister. It's her first desire.

1047
01:33:44,093 --> 01:33:46,073
No matter what happens,
I won't let you go.

1048
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:48,390
I won't let you go.

1049
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:53,535
Alright, I won't go.

1050
01:33:53,773 --> 01:33:55,378
Happy?

1051
01:33:58,891 --> 01:33:59,998
Thank you.

1052
01:34:05,788 --> 01:34:07,888
Ashu. You are here?

1053
01:34:07,968 --> 01:34:10,722
Brother, you were cheating
your sister and leaving?

1054
01:34:11,419 --> 01:34:13,010
Didn't you even care about my Rakhi?

1055
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:16,035
- Ashu, why don't you understand?
- I don't want to listen to anything.

1056
01:34:16,455 --> 01:34:20,726
- What are you doing?!
- I won't let you go!

1057
01:34:21,711 --> 01:34:23,330
No man can work like this.

1058
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,800
If these two keep
being stubborn like this..

1059
01:34:27,946 --> 01:34:29,739
The whole business will be ruined.

1060
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:34,193
Ashu, you are elder and intelligent..

1061
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:37,545
Think, my not going has
caused such a great loss.

1062
01:34:37,934 --> 01:34:41,866
This is called childish ignorance,
not love.

1063
01:34:43,088 --> 01:34:46,149
- Hello.
- Sir, I'm Chander speaking from the office.

1064
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:47,983
- What is it?
- There is bad news.

1065
01:34:48,096 --> 01:34:50,194
- What happened?
- The airplane through which Anand..

1066
01:34:50,235 --> 01:34:54,378
Was to go to Delhi has crashed.
And there are no survivors.

1067
01:34:56,656 --> 01:34:57,710
Mr. Rai!

1068
01:34:59,602 --> 01:35:00,718
What happened, Mr. Rai?

1069
01:35:01,677 --> 01:35:04,350
Why don't you speak? What is it?

1070
01:35:05,069 --> 01:35:07,413
What has happened? Tell me!

1071
01:35:08,543 --> 01:35:10,248
The airplane through which Anand..

1072
01:35:11,969 --> 01:35:14,334
- Was to go to Delhi has crashed.
- What?

1073
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,649
And there are no survivors.

1074
01:35:56,896 --> 01:36:04,896
"There would have been
a great disaster today."

1075
01:36:08,089 --> 01:36:16,089
"This Raksha-Bandhan
has become a giver of life."

1076
01:36:23,714 --> 01:36:31,714
"The love that I wished for,
I have got it now."

1077
01:36:37,405 --> 01:36:45,405
"I have got the real
right to tie a Rakhi."

1078
01:36:51,066 --> 01:36:56,121
- "Do you swear by me?
- I swear."

1079
01:36:56,413 --> 01:37:02,888
"Don't make a delay,
tie me the Rakhi now."

1080
01:37:03,452 --> 01:37:09,355
"Say it again."

1081
01:37:09,435 --> 01:37:17,435
"My dear sister, darling sister."

1082
01:37:42,295 --> 01:37:44,031
Forgive me, Girdhari.

1083
01:37:45,145 --> 01:37:46,463
I am ruined.

1084
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:50,199
Their love and faith has ruined me.

1085
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:52,550
Now that house is mine.

1086
01:37:53,095 --> 01:37:55,525
I can't loot my home.

1087
01:37:55,605 --> 01:37:59,359
I can't do it, Girdhari. Forgive me.

1088
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:06,600
- What happened to you Anand?
- I am reformed now.

1089
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:09,722
I was lost.

1090
01:38:10,195 --> 01:38:14,230
I have found a way,
I was homeless, I found a home.

1091
01:38:14,453 --> 01:38:18,252
I was an orphan,
I got parents and siblings.

1092
01:38:18,754 --> 01:38:23,182
Today, I have a family.
I have become that family's son.

1093
01:38:23,865 --> 01:38:28,056
Now I can't stay in
that house as a thief.

1094
01:38:28,419 --> 01:38:31,143
I can't stay in that house as a thief.

1095
01:38:39,645 --> 01:38:43,953
I am very happy to
see tears in these eyes.

1096
01:38:44,698 --> 01:38:46,967
All the dirt in your
heart has been cleaned.

1097
01:38:49,034 --> 01:38:52,087
I congratulate you on your rebirth.

1098
01:38:53,442 --> 01:38:56,712
I am your own.

1099
01:38:58,370 --> 01:39:00,968
There won't be any shadow
of earlier events on you.

1100
01:39:03,046 --> 01:39:06,486
Go. Live fearlessly.

1101
01:39:07,815 --> 01:39:10,729
My blessings are always with you.

1102
01:39:13,533 --> 01:39:16,415
Thank you, Girdhari. Thank you.

1103
01:39:17,826 --> 01:39:19,704
Thank you so much!

1104
01:39:22,804 --> 01:39:26,428
'Now Mr. Rai's family
can't come out of this trap.'

1105
01:39:26,469 --> 01:39:29,240
'Mr. and Mrs. Rai are in my control.'

1106
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:32,296
'I have become their
children's real brother.'

1107
01:39:33,522 --> 01:39:37,794
'I have fooled them so well
that they have all become blind..'

1108
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:42,668
'..when I'll clear all the stuff there,
they'll see the light.'

1109
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:55,259
- What is this?
- A deal.

1110
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:57,207
I didn't understand.

1111
01:39:58,306 --> 01:40:00,614
Nobody can understand Girdhari.

1112
01:40:01,446 --> 01:40:06,429
This is proof of your good deeds..

1113
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:11,544
- It will be delivered to your family.
- Girdhari!

1114
01:40:14,889 --> 01:40:18,390
Anger always causes a loss to man.

1115
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:21,923
This world is of giving and taking.

1116
01:40:23,035 --> 01:40:27,464
A man has to pay
a price to stay alive.

1117
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:30,489
What do you want?

1118
01:40:40,990 --> 01:40:42,324
How did you get this statue?

1119
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:48,263
This means that you
have seen the real statue.

1120
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:54,384
So is this a fake statue?

1121
01:40:54,504 --> 01:40:57,318
There is no difference
between the real and fake..

1122
01:40:58,225 --> 01:41:06,225
Now your task is only to get
this statue there and that one here.

1123
01:41:10,483 --> 01:41:13,193
'This is our asset.'

1124
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:17,049
'From today, you will take care of it.'
- No!

1125
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:22,625
No, this can't be done.
This is not possible!

1126
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:25,550
It is my respect, my responsibility.

1127
01:41:26,367 --> 01:41:28,512
You can never have that statue.

1128
01:41:28,592 --> 01:41:32,373
- But this tape can be received by them.
- Girdhari!

1129
01:41:34,473 --> 01:41:38,265
No! Don't do such a thing.

1130
01:41:38,523 --> 01:41:41,934
I have been sunk into
the Ganges and found them.

1131
01:41:42,622 --> 01:41:45,962
The alms of these
relations is my life today.

1132
01:41:46,636 --> 01:41:49,575
Don't steal this light from me,
Girdhari.

1133
01:41:50,473 --> 01:41:51,874
Give me freedom.

1134
01:41:53,215 --> 01:41:55,693
I can't break their trust.

1135
01:41:56,771 --> 01:42:01,285
If you wish to, you may kill me!
You can cut me into pieces..

1136
01:42:02,030 --> 01:42:06,432
But please don't fill
my life with this poison.

1137
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:09,410
With this poison your
soul will be purified..

1138
01:42:10,334 --> 01:42:12,467
You will be set free forever.

1139
01:42:13,643 --> 01:42:16,649
You want freedom
and I want the statue.

1140
01:42:17,785 --> 01:42:19,988
You will have to pay this fee.

1141
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:38,284
Boy, this good work
should be done today.

1142
01:42:39,113 --> 01:42:42,351
Tonight there is a
birthday party of Mr. Rai.

1143
01:42:42,771 --> 01:42:45,251
You won't get a better
chance than this.

1144
01:42:52,316 --> 01:42:56,221
So you want to make Anand
the owner of your property?

1145
01:42:56,262 --> 01:42:57,262
Yes.

1146
01:42:58,410 --> 01:43:01,538
Because I don't trust
my son Rakesh at all.

1147
01:43:02,979 --> 01:43:05,979
Sir, this will is mandatory..

1148
01:43:07,035 --> 01:43:10,670
So that my family lives
in peace after I die.

1149
01:43:11,313 --> 01:43:15,441
- Mr. Rai, do you trust Anand?
- Absolutely.

1150
01:43:16,151 --> 01:43:19,753
"Happy birthday to you."

1151
01:43:19,979 --> 01:43:23,450
"Happy birthday to you."

1152
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:27,476
"Happy birthday to you."

1153
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:33,954
Many happy returns of the day, daddy.

1154
01:43:33,995 --> 01:43:36,134
Thank you, darling.

1155
01:43:36,505 --> 01:43:38,784
- Happy birthday, daddy.
- Thank you, my dear.

1156
01:43:39,882 --> 01:43:41,052
Where is my present?

1157
01:43:42,877 --> 01:43:44,925
This is the present from us.

1158
01:43:54,507 --> 01:43:57,923
Boss, first open the present
and check what is inside it.

1159
01:43:58,597 --> 01:44:02,626
I feel scared to unwrap priceless
present, child. It might get stolen.

1160
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,912
Ladies and gentlemen.

1161
01:44:07,302 --> 01:44:11,097
You all know that
on this auspicious day..

1162
01:44:11,456 --> 01:44:16,702
You get a bonus of
one month every year.

1163
01:44:17,419 --> 01:44:19,760
But this year..

1164
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:25,704
I am giving you bonus of 3 months.
Applause.

1165
01:44:35,202 --> 01:44:38,310
Manager, where are you lost?
Celebrate.

1166
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:40,842
- You too got a bonus of 3 months.
- No, Shanno.

1167
01:44:41,854 --> 01:44:43,871
Anand didn't get a bonus of 3 months..

1168
01:44:43,912 --> 01:44:47,919
But a bonus of our love
and trust for his whole life.

1169
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:51,018
Wow! You are very lucky, sir.

1170
01:44:51,233 --> 01:44:53,317
This is a bonus which
will never get depleted..

1171
01:44:53,397 --> 01:44:55,288
But it keeps of on increasing.

1172
01:44:55,368 --> 01:44:59,331
Why are you looking at me now?
Come, dance and sing with us today.

1173
01:44:59,411 --> 01:45:01,016
Come on.

1174
01:45:18,439 --> 01:45:26,057
"Mister Manager."

1175
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:34,592
"You too dance and sing
with us for some time."

1176
01:45:34,974 --> 01:45:42,974
"You too dance and sing
with us for some time."

1177
01:45:44,107 --> 01:45:47,393
"Mister Manager."

1178
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:51,911
"Mister Manager."

1179
01:46:10,023 --> 01:46:14,269
"I had witnessed this
day in the past too."

1180
01:46:14,349 --> 01:46:18,574
"But this happiness
has doubled because of you."

1181
01:46:18,654 --> 01:46:22,811
"This happiness has
doubled because of you."

1182
01:46:22,930 --> 01:46:27,321
"Don't go away making some excuse,
now don't get upset with us."

1183
01:46:27,362 --> 01:46:31,421
"Don't go away making some excuse,
now don't get upset with us."

1184
01:46:31,501 --> 01:46:35,185
"You are now mine."

1185
01:46:35,358 --> 01:46:39,333
"Don't break this relationship."

1186
01:46:39,505 --> 01:46:47,430
"You too dance and sing
with us for some time."

1187
01:46:48,205 --> 01:46:55,572
"You too dance and sing
with us for some time."

1188
01:46:57,163 --> 01:47:00,891
"Mister Manager."

1189
01:47:01,407 --> 01:47:04,704
"Mister Manager."

1190
01:47:23,668 --> 01:47:31,668
"Who has taught me to laugh and filled
my life with colours and fragrance."

1191
01:47:36,411 --> 01:47:44,411
"Who has taught me to laugh and filled
my life with colours and fragrance."

1192
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:48,490
"I pray to God."

1193
01:47:48,649 --> 01:47:52,712
"That my life should be for him."

1194
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:56,929
"That my life should be for him."

1195
01:47:57,009 --> 01:48:00,580
"He is a deity."

1196
01:48:00,867 --> 01:48:04,680
"Whom I have found."

1197
01:48:05,741 --> 01:48:12,951
"You too dance and sing
with us for some time."

1198
01:48:14,101 --> 01:48:20,882
"You too dance and sing
with us for some time."

1199
01:48:22,363 --> 01:48:25,941
"Mister Manager."

1200
01:48:26,812 --> 01:48:30,496
"Mister Manager."

1201
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:11,169
Mr. Rai.

1202
01:50:18,577 --> 01:50:20,037
No!

1203
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:11,430
Scoundrel, I will avenge
my father's death with you.

1204
01:51:15,190 --> 01:51:17,812
Thieves plunder at
the point of a weapon..

1205
01:51:17,853 --> 01:51:20,474
But you have strangled
us with your love.

1206
01:51:23,023 --> 01:51:24,262
Imposter!

1207
01:51:24,732 --> 01:51:30,494
You acted like a brother and son and
broke the trust of my mother and sister.

1208
01:51:39,425 --> 01:51:44,214
Scoundrel, I don't want
to kill you with my own hands.

1209
01:51:44,825 --> 01:51:48,840
- Ram Singh, phone the police.
- There is no need to phone them.

1210
01:51:50,132 --> 01:51:51,332
Let him go.

1211
01:51:55,171 --> 01:51:56,179
Ruffian!

1212
01:52:21,424 --> 01:52:23,975
'This is the story
of this unfortunate man.'

1213
01:52:24,246 --> 01:52:28,475
'Shanno, forget me if possible.'

1214
01:52:33,842 --> 01:52:36,780
No Shanno, nothing can be done now.

1215
01:52:37,163 --> 01:52:40,949
I can't stay here.
I am defamed as thief.

1216
01:52:41,588 --> 01:52:43,653
- Nobody can erase this disgrace.
- You can do it.

1217
01:52:44,372 --> 01:52:45,822
The time has changed now.

1218
01:52:46,642 --> 01:52:50,436
The man who made me human
I betrayed his trust.

1219
01:52:51,286 --> 01:52:53,439
That great man died
with a burden on his soul.

1220
01:52:54,387 --> 01:52:58,258
- His funeral procession took place and I felt as if I had died.
- Anand.

1221
01:52:59,178 --> 01:53:00,848
My life is worthless now.

1222
01:53:00,889 --> 01:53:02,995
You have.
You will live for the same house..

1223
01:53:03,327 --> 01:53:05,011
Where you came to plunder wealth..

1224
01:53:05,137 --> 01:53:08,504
But they made you rich with
the wealth of love and trust.

1225
01:53:08,632 --> 01:53:11,034
Under whose care are you leaving them?
Of Rakesh?

1226
01:53:11,395 --> 01:53:13,116
He was waiting for this day only.

1227
01:53:13,449 --> 01:53:15,163
Now he will take revenge with everyone.

1228
01:53:15,243 --> 01:53:16,906
The mother will have to beg for her life.

1229
01:53:16,947 --> 01:53:18,610
The children will live on his mercy.

1230
01:53:18,794 --> 01:53:21,298
- Those innocents will have to suffer because of your crime.
- No!

1231
01:53:21,322 --> 01:53:22,695
Now you will have to live here.

1232
01:53:22,775 --> 01:53:25,083
You will have to protect
the belongings of the master.

1233
01:53:25,361 --> 01:53:27,755
This is your duty and your penance.

1234
01:53:31,457 --> 01:53:33,812
'This is your duty and your penance.'

1235
01:53:36,756 --> 01:53:39,097
I thought that
he was the king of destiny..

1236
01:53:39,859 --> 01:53:41,659
But he turned out to be
as useless as stone.

1237
01:53:41,683 --> 01:53:43,307
But what will happen now, sir?

1238
01:53:43,876 --> 01:53:45,460
My one man has been defeated.

1239
01:53:46,885 --> 01:53:47,885
No problem.

1240
01:53:48,859 --> 01:53:50,238
I have the other pawn in stock.

1241
01:53:50,897 --> 01:53:52,874
- I will fit him.
- What do you mean?

1242
01:53:54,876 --> 01:53:56,851
It won't be too difficult..

1243
01:53:58,922 --> 01:54:00,731
To make use of Rakesh.

1244
01:54:01,070 --> 01:54:03,813
Cheers!

1245
01:54:04,807 --> 01:54:08,035
Sir, you are great. We should
learn to live our lives from you.

1246
01:54:08,115 --> 01:54:14,129
- Life means to live in liveliness.
- Great! - Well said.

1247
01:55:53,937 --> 01:55:55,038
- Stop it!
- Raju.

1248
01:55:55,281 --> 01:55:56,922
Stop this evil act.

1249
01:55:57,141 --> 01:55:58,934
Our house is like a temple.

1250
01:55:59,058 --> 01:56:01,192
I won't let this become
a den of gratification.

1251
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:04,903
Disrespectful! How dare you drink
liquor in front of your elder brother?

1252
01:56:05,113 --> 01:56:06,345
How did I dare?

1253
01:56:06,409 --> 01:56:09,067
When you can dare to drink liquor
in front of helpless mother and sister..

1254
01:56:09,091 --> 01:56:11,884
And righteous father..

1255
01:56:12,207 --> 01:56:15,463
- Then I too can drink in front of worthless brother.
- Shut up!

1256
01:56:19,418 --> 01:56:21,703
Drink! Drink more!

1257
01:56:21,951 --> 01:56:24,679
Now this was the
only thing left. Stupid!

1258
01:56:25,101 --> 01:56:28,113
Celebrate. All of you celebrate.

1259
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:32,375
You won't offer the water of Ganges
to the ashes of your father..

1260
01:56:32,782 --> 01:56:34,716
But with drops of liquor.

1261
01:56:35,091 --> 01:56:37,212
With drops of liquor!

1262
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:12,226
Raju, why are you crying?

1263
01:57:12,607 --> 01:57:14,804
What happened?
Tell me what happened, Raju.

1264
01:57:15,662 --> 01:57:18,249
Rakesh brother has
defiled the whole house.

1265
01:57:18,495 --> 01:57:21,325
Immoral people come to the house.
They drink liquor.

1266
01:57:21,405 --> 01:57:23,394
They sing and dance.

1267
01:57:24,906 --> 01:57:27,858
Mother cries secretly.
She cannot say anything.

1268
01:57:28,277 --> 01:57:30,272
Brother Rakesh orders mother around.

1269
01:57:30,495 --> 01:57:33,225
He scolds sister and beats me.

1270
01:57:33,448 --> 01:57:35,136
No, Raju. Don't cry.

1271
01:57:36,284 --> 01:57:38,980
I won't go there again.
I won't live there.

1272
01:57:40,293 --> 01:57:43,386
Alright, do stay there.
Will you stay with me? Come on.

1273
01:57:47,546 --> 01:57:51,532
No, no. I will not stay here.

1274
01:57:52,223 --> 01:57:55,247
I will not stay here.

1275
01:58:14,028 --> 01:58:18,741
Come on, darling.
Cheers! Everybody. Cheers.

1276
01:58:19,341 --> 01:58:21,099
Cheers!

1277
01:58:23,579 --> 01:58:26,957
I love you, darling.
Come on, you don't kiss me.

1278
01:58:27,158 --> 01:58:30,038
I love you wholeheartedly.

1279
01:58:36,104 --> 01:58:40,099
- You won't get some.
- Gopal, I am feeling suffocated here.

1280
01:58:40,616 --> 01:58:43,766
- Take me away from here.
- Gopal! - I am coming, sir.

1281
01:58:54,262 --> 01:58:56,184
Ma'am!

1282
01:58:57,251 --> 01:59:00,291
When God has not given you leg then
why you are interested in roaming around.

1283
01:59:00,579 --> 01:59:02,185
Can't you sit at one place?

1284
01:59:03,591 --> 01:59:05,337
I can't tolerate this.

1285
01:59:05,654 --> 01:59:07,974
I will have to send you
to some hermitage very soon.

1286
01:59:08,979 --> 01:59:12,146
This living corpse won't
be in my house anymore.

1287
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:22,678
'This living corpse won't
be in my house anymore.'

1288
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:25,315
'This living corpse won't
be in my house anymore.'

1289
01:59:34,902 --> 01:59:37,618
Ashu!

1290
01:59:57,969 --> 01:59:59,327
Ashu!

1291
02:00:04,907 --> 02:00:06,645
Ashu, wait!

1292
02:00:12,742 --> 02:00:14,758
Ashu, what were you going to do?

1293
02:00:14,838 --> 02:00:16,153
Why did you save me?

1294
02:00:16,233 --> 02:00:18,450
To keep me alive and watch
my helplessness with joy.

1295
02:00:18,491 --> 02:00:20,133
- No, Ashu, no.
- No.

1296
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:22,664
- No, Ashu.
- We were already living a miserable life.

1297
02:00:22,938 --> 02:00:24,707
What did you get by making it worse?

1298
02:00:24,833 --> 02:00:27,015
You are the one who
has ruined this bungalow..

1299
02:00:27,274 --> 02:00:29,290
Where people are living like a corpse.

1300
02:00:53,935 --> 02:00:55,845
Don't go avoiding me like this, ma'am.

1301
02:00:56,970 --> 02:01:01,529
I can't endure it anymore.
Your silence is killing me.

1302
02:01:02,384 --> 02:01:05,172
Curse me, scold me.

1303
02:01:05,474 --> 02:01:07,494
You can call me a murderer!

1304
02:01:08,392 --> 02:01:11,327
Say something. I am your culprit.

1305
02:01:11,831 --> 02:01:14,354
Punish me. Crush me.

1306
02:01:14,923 --> 02:01:16,505
I will tolerate all the punishment..

1307
02:01:17,373 --> 02:01:19,916
But I can't tolerate
the pain of your silence.

1308
02:01:21,428 --> 02:01:23,572
Don't give me so severe
punishment, ma'am.

1309
02:01:24,290 --> 02:01:27,873
I can neither live nor die.

1310
02:01:41,949 --> 02:01:44,410
You would be the
lord of the whole world.

1311
02:01:45,663 --> 02:01:49,484
You are not my lord.
You have always given me suffering.

1312
02:01:50,620 --> 02:01:52,707
I was like a stone,
but you gave me feelings.

1313
02:01:53,363 --> 02:01:55,077
I was a sinner, you made me human.

1314
02:01:55,583 --> 02:01:58,263
You filled my heart with emotions
and taught me the meaning of love.

1315
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,484
When my small world was settled..

1316
02:02:02,234 --> 02:02:04,848
You ruined it. You made me lonely.

1317
02:02:06,198 --> 02:02:08,071
You gave me everything
and then took it away.

1318
02:02:09,180 --> 02:02:12,958
So, now take away my feelings.
Make me like a stone again..

1319
02:02:14,187 --> 02:02:15,675
So that I can neither see..

1320
02:02:16,894 --> 02:02:17,973
Nor hear..

1321
02:02:19,543 --> 02:02:22,355
Nor feel anything.

1322
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:26,785
The statue is in our house?

1323
02:02:28,684 --> 02:02:33,629
It is not just a statue
but a key to change your destiny.

1324
02:02:34,977 --> 02:02:38,633
Friend, you don't know your worth.

1325
02:02:40,286 --> 02:02:43,414
You are not millionaire
but billionaire.

1326
02:02:43,521 --> 02:02:44,786
Billionaire?

1327
02:02:45,372 --> 02:02:47,997
Yes, bring that statue.

1328
02:02:49,227 --> 02:02:51,815
And then see how
I will change your status.

1329
02:02:56,050 --> 02:02:58,650
Statue? What statue?

1330
02:02:59,142 --> 02:03:03,443
The same family heirloom that you
hid even from your own son till today.

1331
02:03:03,935 --> 02:03:06,759
- I want that statue.
- Why?

1332
02:03:07,567 --> 02:03:12,207
Mother, you don't know it's worth.
We are only called millionaire.

1333
02:03:12,782 --> 02:03:15,606
That statue will open
the doors of wealth for us.

1334
02:03:18,349 --> 02:03:19,873
I will expand my business.

1335
02:03:20,041 --> 02:03:22,959
I will start derbies,
buildings, 5-star hotels.

1336
02:03:23,133 --> 02:03:26,696
- I will become a rich man.
- By selling the honour of your ancestors.

1337
02:03:27,911 --> 02:03:31,052
This is the world of business
and not sentiments.

1338
02:03:31,454 --> 02:03:34,407
I won't let the symbol of my ancestors
to be auctioned in the market.

1339
02:03:35,345 --> 02:03:39,259
- It is our faith, worship and God.
- Today, money is the biggest God.

1340
02:03:39,514 --> 02:03:41,530
You can worship even
a God made up of mud.

1341
02:03:42,057 --> 02:03:43,897
- Give me the keys.
- You won't get the keys.

1342
02:03:43,977 --> 02:03:47,343
Why won't I get it?
My orders are obeyed here.

1343
02:03:47,601 --> 02:03:49,798
- You will have to give me the keys.
- I won't give you the keys.

1344
02:03:49,822 --> 02:03:53,363
Mother! Mother, I will take the key.

1345
02:03:53,613 --> 02:03:56,015
- Give me the keys!
- No. - Give me the keys!

1346
02:03:56,095 --> 02:03:57,527
- No.
- No!

1347
02:04:00,105 --> 02:04:02,038
How dare you raise
your hand on mother!

1348
02:04:05,612 --> 02:04:09,533
I will avenge the injustice
that you did on them.

1349
02:04:09,653 --> 02:04:12,666
You have hurt the feelings
of your sad sister.

1350
02:04:12,707 --> 02:04:13,845
Scoundrel!

1351
02:04:16,205 --> 02:04:19,943
You have hurt the mother
who gave birth to you.

1352
02:04:20,259 --> 02:04:21,455
You made her cry in sorrow.

1353
02:04:23,447 --> 02:04:27,244
I won't allow you to live here.
Get out of my house.

1354
02:04:28,357 --> 02:04:31,322
- Your house?
- Yes, my house.

1355
02:04:32,342 --> 02:04:33,984
This is Mr. Rai's Will.

1356
02:04:34,064 --> 02:04:37,498
All the things of this place
are bestowed to me by its rule.

1357
02:04:38,178 --> 02:04:39,420
I am the owner of this house.

1358
02:04:45,630 --> 02:04:47,868
I never wanted to
make use of this will.

1359
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:54,196
Rakesh, the life of your father
couldn't make you a good human being..

1360
02:04:56,248 --> 02:05:01,286
But I was hopeful that his
death will make you a good human..

1361
02:05:03,323 --> 02:05:05,774
Good son, and good brother.

1362
02:05:06,739 --> 02:05:08,520
But you have become more devilish.

1363
02:05:08,703 --> 02:05:11,809
You made their lives miserable.
Your cruelty increased.

1364
02:05:12,605 --> 02:05:15,289
Therefore,
I was forced to make use of this will.

1365
02:05:16,518 --> 02:05:19,928
Get out of here. I say, get out!

1366
02:06:35,090 --> 02:06:39,030
But whatever Anand
thought didn't happen.

1367
02:06:39,522 --> 02:06:42,301
Destiny has played a
cruel joke on that sad man.

1368
02:06:42,932 --> 02:06:45,826
Ma'am, he has already been punished.

1369
02:06:46,402 --> 02:06:48,288
He is trying to repent for his crimes.

1370
02:06:48,850 --> 02:06:51,229
If possible, forgive him.

1371
02:07:08,864 --> 02:07:09,864
Sign here.

1372
02:07:11,787 --> 02:07:16,897
Girdhari, if this wealth
and property had been mine..

1373
02:07:17,756 --> 02:07:21,764
Then I would have given
it to a greedy dog like you.

1374
02:07:23,021 --> 02:07:28,000
But it belongs to that righteous
woman and those innocent children.

1375
02:07:32,788 --> 02:07:38,061
Scoundrels, you can skin me alive..

1376
02:07:39,627 --> 02:07:45,123
But you won't get what you want.
Understood?

1377
02:07:53,419 --> 02:07:54,983
Uncle Diwan has not yet come.

1378
02:07:55,707 --> 02:07:58,110
- Shanno, I found Anand.
- Where is he?

1379
02:08:03,943 --> 02:08:05,595
- We couldn't find Shanno.
- What did you say?

1380
02:08:05,619 --> 02:08:07,080
Sir, we searched each and every corner.

1381
02:08:07,104 --> 02:08:08,104
Shut up!

1382
02:08:08,926 --> 02:08:11,259
No matter how,
but find Shanno and bring her here.

1383
02:08:12,016 --> 02:08:16,989
If we don't find Shanno,
I won't spare you alive.

1384
02:08:18,684 --> 02:08:21,016
On Anand's birthday..

1385
02:08:22,141 --> 02:08:26,558
I want to see beauties
and suffering of a lover.

1386
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:31,668
So, I want Shanno.

1387
02:08:32,548 --> 02:08:35,301
Whether she's real or look alike.

1388
02:08:35,381 --> 02:08:39,133
- Look alike?
- Yes. Look alike.

1389
02:08:40,627 --> 02:08:44,401
"Happy birthday to you!"

1390
02:08:44,442 --> 02:08:47,549
"Happy birthday to you."

1391
02:08:47,957 --> 02:08:50,226
"Happy birthday to you."

1392
02:08:53,817 --> 02:08:55,188
Shanno?

1393
02:08:58,809 --> 02:08:59,957
Leave me!

1394
02:09:01,284 --> 02:09:02,596
Leave me!

1395
02:09:04,316 --> 02:09:05,875
Scoundrel, let go of me!

1396
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:19,702
Ready? Ready, Raju.

1397
02:09:56,463 --> 02:09:57,776
Wait!

1398
02:10:00,988 --> 02:10:01,988
Untie him.

1399
02:10:15,451 --> 02:10:23,451
"Don't write your name in any case."

1400
02:10:24,786 --> 02:10:31,138
"On some wrong papers."

1401
02:10:31,715 --> 02:10:39,715
"I have brought the page of heart."

1402
02:10:40,949 --> 02:10:48,437
"I will make you
write your name on it."

1403
02:11:06,832 --> 02:11:10,879
"Your admirers have come."

1404
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:15,527
"They have come.
Your admirers have come."

1405
02:11:16,125 --> 02:11:20,615
"They will leave after
creating commotion."

1406
02:11:20,695 --> 02:11:25,012
"They will leave after
creating commotion."

1407
02:11:25,092 --> 02:11:28,669
"Either we will take
our sweetheart along."

1408
02:11:28,749 --> 02:11:33,886
"We will return. Either we
will take our sweetheart along."

1409
02:11:34,044 --> 02:11:38,501
"Or sacrifice our lives here."

1410
02:11:38,581 --> 02:11:42,803
"Or sacrifice our lives here."

1411
02:11:42,965 --> 02:11:47,149
"Your admirers have come."

1412
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:50,322
"Those are full of words are
unable to take actions."

1413
02:11:50,370 --> 02:11:52,555
- "They don't take action."
- "They don't take action."

1414
02:11:52,667 --> 02:11:56,772
"Tell these people
to go some place else."

1415
02:11:56,852 --> 02:12:00,264
"Only the fake admirers have come."

1416
02:12:00,305 --> 02:12:05,063
"They have come.
Only the fake admirers have come."

1417
02:12:05,586 --> 02:12:09,955
"They will leave after shouting."

1418
02:12:09,996 --> 02:12:14,626
"They will leave after shouting."

1419
02:12:14,737 --> 02:12:18,430
"I swear on my youth."

1420
02:12:18,471 --> 02:12:23,240
"I swear on my youth."

1421
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:28,062
"I will leave after
getting my darling."

1422
02:12:28,103 --> 02:12:32,698
"I will leave after
getting my darling."

1423
02:12:32,739 --> 02:12:36,538
"Your admirers have come."

1424
02:12:55,632 --> 02:13:00,320
"My dear, don't trust the appearance."

1425
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:04,854
"Make few guesses
by looking at the eyes."

1426
02:13:04,934 --> 02:13:09,060
"Make few guesses
by looking at the eyes."

1427
02:13:09,101 --> 02:13:13,662
"The eyes are expressing
the feelings of my heart."

1428
02:13:13,781 --> 02:13:17,955
"In front of you your
sweetheart is standing."

1429
02:13:18,494 --> 02:13:26,494
"With my eyes."

1430
02:13:27,495 --> 02:13:31,984
"I will tell you some
secret before leaving."

1431
02:13:32,299 --> 02:13:36,236
"They will leave after shouting."

1432
02:13:36,277 --> 02:13:40,658
"Your admirers have come."

1433
02:13:54,982 --> 02:14:02,982
"I know and I understand
what is real and what is fake."

1434
02:14:04,219 --> 02:14:08,591
"What is real and what is fake."

1435
02:14:08,663 --> 02:14:12,920
"Reality is reality.
Fiction is fiction."

1436
02:14:13,204 --> 02:14:17,276
"You are my love and you are my life."

1437
02:14:17,895 --> 02:14:21,950
"No matter what others say."

1438
02:14:22,141 --> 02:14:26,227
"No matter what others say."

1439
02:14:26,690 --> 02:14:31,281
"I will take you in palanquin."

1440
02:14:31,361 --> 02:14:35,640
"I will take you in palanquin."

1441
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:40,102
"Your admirers have come."

1442
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:04,024
"I deserve to get in the palanquin."

1443
02:15:04,065 --> 02:15:07,656
"From where did you drop in between?"

1444
02:15:07,697 --> 02:15:12,659
"I have not been dropped
but I have come."

1445
02:15:13,159 --> 02:15:16,659
"Praising his name."

1446
02:15:16,700 --> 02:15:20,944
"It is not decency
to steal someone's love."

1447
02:15:21,248 --> 02:15:25,162
"It is called plundering.
It is called injustice."

1448
02:15:25,514 --> 02:15:30,401
"Both of you have patience
to get your rights."

1449
02:15:30,481 --> 02:15:34,431
"Both of you have patience
to get your rights."

1450
02:15:34,892 --> 02:15:39,247
"I will go after
giving you your rights."

1451
02:15:39,288 --> 02:15:43,829
"I will sacrifice
my life before leaving."

1452
02:15:43,870 --> 02:15:47,950
"Your admirers have come."

1453
02:15:48,822 --> 02:15:53,263
"Cross it over. Cross it over.
Take your sweetheart and flee from here."

1454
02:15:53,304 --> 02:15:57,678
"Cross it over. Cross it over.
Take your sweetheart and flee from here."

1455
02:16:03,705 --> 02:16:08,182
"You are the master of masters."

1456
02:16:08,262 --> 02:16:12,939
"I am the disciple of your disciples."

1457
02:16:12,980 --> 02:16:16,987
"I am the disciple of your disciples."

1458
02:16:17,106 --> 02:16:21,505
"I did what you have taught me."

1459
02:16:21,687 --> 02:16:26,258
"I have used the trick
learnt from you on you."

1460
02:16:26,299 --> 02:16:30,576
"The master who have such disciples."

1461
02:16:30,834 --> 02:16:35,027
"The master who have such disciples."

1462
02:16:35,495 --> 02:16:39,983
"They will leave
after becoming famous."

1463
02:16:40,056 --> 02:16:44,335
"They will leave
after becoming famous."

1464
02:16:44,376 --> 02:16:48,638
"Your admirers have come."

1465
02:16:58,109 --> 02:17:06,109
"Only you have understood me.
And I understand everyone else."

1466
02:17:07,299 --> 02:17:11,471
"And I understand everyone else."

1467
02:17:11,512 --> 02:17:16,060
"Let me reward you
for your understanding."

1468
02:17:16,267 --> 02:17:20,493
"Let me show you the
consequence that is the best."

1469
02:17:20,927 --> 02:17:25,040
"Some tricks of the master."

1470
02:17:25,124 --> 02:17:29,578
"Some tricks of the master."

1471
02:17:29,946 --> 02:17:34,532
"I will leave after showing you that."

1472
02:17:34,611 --> 02:17:37,086
"I will show you."

1473
02:17:42,532 --> 02:17:43,746
Beware!

1474
02:17:45,115 --> 02:17:50,919
If you try to move I will kill
everyone along with you.

1475
02:17:52,957 --> 02:17:57,822
"I only gave him heart
and taught him the art of love."

1476
02:18:00,032 --> 02:18:03,489
"See the greatness of God!
Now he is using that art against me."

1477
02:18:04,309 --> 02:18:06,252
- Mr. Diwan.
- Yes.

1478
02:18:07,103 --> 02:18:10,532
You were my own men. Then what
was the need to come as a stranger?

1479
02:18:11,316 --> 02:18:14,365
Sir, I have not come,
but I have been brought here.

1480
02:18:17,282 --> 02:18:20,024
Old age has come in your childhood.

1481
02:18:20,540 --> 02:18:24,970
Dear, you still have your milk teeth.

1482
02:18:27,314 --> 02:18:28,521
Tie all of them.

1483
02:18:31,735 --> 02:18:34,417
- Why are you taking this trouble? I will walk myself.
- Shut up!

1484
02:19:39,710 --> 02:19:40,976
Drink it.

1485
02:19:43,754 --> 02:19:44,937
Bravo!

1486
02:19:48,484 --> 02:19:50,874
Bravo, he is finished. Bravo,

1487
02:19:53,937 --> 02:19:56,831
- She is our Shanno.
- She is a look alike.

1488
02:20:57,805 --> 02:20:59,164
Anand!

1489
02:21:04,751 --> 02:21:08,277
Anand!

1490
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:29,093
- Doctor...
- He is out of danger. We have removed the bullet.

1491
02:21:29,277 --> 02:21:32,194
Doctor, I want to take
the statement of Mr. Anand.

1492
02:21:32,266 --> 02:21:34,565
Not now. You can take this
statement tomorrow morning.

1493
02:21:44,204 --> 02:21:46,225
Mother. Mother, please save me.

1494
02:21:46,484 --> 02:21:47,984
I have shot Anand.

1495
02:21:48,183 --> 02:21:50,023
Today my life and death
is in his hands.

1496
02:21:50,103 --> 02:21:53,679
Save me before he gives statement
to the police. Mother, save me.

1497
02:21:54,019 --> 02:21:56,046
I know that he respects you very much.

1498
02:21:56,126 --> 02:21:58,835
He will never go against you.
You can only save me.

1499
02:21:59,022 --> 02:22:01,952
You can only save me, mother.

1500
02:22:02,032 --> 02:22:05,514
- Only you save me.
- Nobody can save Rakesh now.

1501
02:22:06,006 --> 02:22:09,709
- He should be punished for his crimes.
- Good morning, Mr. Anand.

1502
02:22:13,472 --> 02:22:16,510
Mr. Anand,
I have come to take you statement.

1503
02:22:16,677 --> 02:22:18,151
- Statement?
- Yes.

1504
02:22:18,231 --> 02:22:19,799
The police wants to know that..

1505
02:22:19,879 --> 02:22:22,941
In the commotion of Prem Kutir,
who shot at you?

1506
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:36,852
Inspector, I don't know
that in such a huge commotion..

1507
02:22:38,246 --> 02:22:42,658
Who shot the bullet and from where.

1508
02:22:59,006 --> 02:23:03,591
Anand, I didn't think
that you would save me.

1509
02:23:04,558 --> 02:23:09,226
By saving me you have killed
the demon that was residing in me.

1510
02:23:10,016 --> 02:23:12,159
I can never forget your favour.

1511
02:23:14,535 --> 02:23:17,347
Even a real brother can't be so kind.

1512
02:23:18,392 --> 02:23:21,454
Please forgive me, my brother.
Forgive me.

1513
02:23:21,805 --> 02:23:24,723
Forgive me, my brother. Forgive me.

1514
02:23:24,764 --> 02:23:29,509
Don't ask forgiveness from me,
but that Goddess.

1515
02:23:30,647 --> 02:23:31,951
Touch mother's feet.

1516
02:23:33,415 --> 02:23:35,358
You will get ablution
from all your crimes.

1517
02:23:49,359 --> 02:23:54,292
Please forgive me, mother.
Please forgive me.

1518
02:23:58,801 --> 02:23:59,801
Ma'am..

1519
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:07,707
I am very unfortunate.
I can't even ask for your forgiveness..

1520
02:24:09,174 --> 02:24:13,713
Because I know that
my crime is unpardonable.

1521
02:24:16,451 --> 02:24:20,391
I am going far away from all of you.

1522
02:24:22,435 --> 02:24:24,119
But I am not going empty-handed.

1523
02:24:25,514 --> 02:24:27,074
I am leaving after
stealing many things.

1524
02:24:29,101 --> 02:24:30,123
Mother's love..

1525
02:24:32,898 --> 02:24:34,353
And love of brother and sister.

1526
02:24:45,485 --> 02:24:46,485
Son!

1527
02:25:17,174 --> 02:25:23,559
"I don't know for which
deeds I got this boon."

1528
02:25:23,861 --> 02:25:30,822
"I received this house
which is like a temple."

1529
02:25:31,568 --> 02:25:37,619
"You must be the dream
of every mother and father."

1530
02:25:37,933 --> 02:25:44,595
"There won't be anyone dear like you."
