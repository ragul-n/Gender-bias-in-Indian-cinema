1
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,313
Out again?

2
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,549
Come on inside.

3
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,353
Good morning.

4
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,596
We are organizing a choir
to give thanks to the Virgin,

5
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,516
in the month of May.

6
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,631
We will practice
everyday in the schoolyard.

7
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,670
Great!

8
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,632
Out you go now.

9
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,108
In order.
Go with Mother Testor.

10
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,318
Where do you think you're going?
Have you done your homework?

11
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,833
What happened again last Friday?

12
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,998
I was at the hairdresser's,
helping Pepi.

13
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,395
Look, tell your mother

14
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,636
if she wants you to work,
better not come here.

15
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,314
Plenty girls would love

16
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,432
to have a scholarship like you
and wouldn't waste it!

17
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,475
Come on...

18
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,837
Sit down.
Do the sums from the beginning.

19
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,271
I want to sing too!

20
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,710
Good girls sing,

21
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,831
obedient girls, Eulalia.

22
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,476
The girls who deserve it.

23
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,310
...with flowers to the Virgin Mary,

24
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,273
our mother.

25
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,715
With flowers to the Virgin Mary,

26
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,036
our mother.

27
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,829
Please...

28
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,792
Please! Are you crazy? No please!

29
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,431
No, no, no please!

30
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,918
I want you to leave,
do you understand me?

31
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,871
How many times I've told you
not to open the door? Are you stupid?

32
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,038
They're after money we don't have!

33
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,117
Idiot, finish your homework.

34
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,311
You still here?
I want you out, beat it!

35
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,119
Don't want to see you anymore!

36
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,436
You're a bloody disgrace!

37
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,472
I'm ashamed!

38
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,350
Is this the time to get home?

39
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,630
Go on, serve out the food!

40
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,556
Fuck! I don't believe it!

41
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,760
I am here teaching kids.
You understand that?

42
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,955
What do you want? Cash?

43
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,795
Do your fucking job!

44
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,669
Leave us in peace...

45
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,237
you bastard!

46
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,435
Fuck!

47
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,198
No way, come on.

48
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,710
My God!

49
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,597
No, no way, Rigga.

50
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,638
Come on, join us for a bit.

51
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,956
I can't, Dani,
I have a test tomorrow.

52
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,516
Look, Laia,

53
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,790
I'm fed up with your fucking books.

54
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,036
You are happy in the factory.

55
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,629
Good, I'm not.
Let me try and do what I want.

56
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,876
- Who says I'm?
- Please!

57
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,438
Please, I beg you.

58
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,595
Please.

59
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,390
You have to do it.
Please, I beg you.

60
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,793
Look, girl, I help married women
who already have children

61
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,118
and can't cope with another,
but you are young, just married...

62
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,437
No. Please.

63
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,628
You don't understand.

64
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,989
You don't understand.

65
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,152
I have two more years study.

66
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,516
I have to teach, I want to travel.

67
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,474
If I have this baby now,
everything closes in on me.

68
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,957
Shuts down.

69
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,958
Please! Please! Please!

70
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,513
Okay.

71
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,273
Listen carefully.

72
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,388
Just tell everyone how happy you are.

73
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,671
Okay.

74
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,554
It'll just look like
a normal miscarriage.

75
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,439
Wait a minute.

76
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,595
Sister,

77
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,472
we are looking for
Kushila Tamang's family.

78
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,875
The father died
and they couldn't pay anymore.

79
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,150
They went to Sinamangal,
to the sucumbasi.

80
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,351
- To the shanty town?
- Yes.

81
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,797
Do you know
where Kushila Tamang's family is?

82
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,036
Her mother is over there, washing.

83
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,629
- Thanks so much.
- Thanks so much.

84
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,634
Are you all brothers?

85
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,636
Yes.

86
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,229
Sister, how many children do you have?

87
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,908
Why do you want to know?

88
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,677
Because we are going to open
a school for them.

89
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,790
Downstairs.

90
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,679
I don't want to!

91
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,791
What the hell is this?

92
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,279
No, no.

93
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,151
Let's eat, ugly man.

94
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,876
Let's eat, ugly man.

95
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,996
You're such an ugly woman.

96
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,398
Mother's furious.

97
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,953
Don't touch a thing!

98
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,037
We've been told!

99
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,153
How can you be with untouchables

100
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,238
bringing shame to this house?

101
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,319
Don't call them that,
they are poor people who need help.

102
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,080
Nobody goes over there
but you have to go!

103
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,352
You don't give a damn
for your home or your husband!

104
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,198
All the neighbours are gossiping!

105
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,311
You are bringing bad luck
to this house!

106
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,919
Don't touch anything!

107
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,514
What are you looking at?
Put gold in the water

108
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,836
and purify everything she's touched!

109
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,355
My God!

110
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,595
Thanks.

111
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,675
Crazy woman, you're so ugly.

"Dear Sharmila:

114
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,279
You don' know how much I miss you,

115
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,916
the children and all the mothers.

116
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:59,028
After so much work
I can finally give you some good news.

117
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:03,792
Since I told a newspaper
about my arranged marriage,

118
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,911
it has been non-stop!

119
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,350
We are getting lots of sponsors..."

01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,910
My kids! You're all here!

122
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,074
Everything is fine.

123
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,797
You're in the 16th week.

124
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,151
Weight, height, head...
Everything normal.

125
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,477
- Is that the heart?
- Yes.

126
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,357
You're going to have
a very healthy girl.

127
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,559
What did you say?

128
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,035
It can't be. I know it's a boy.

129
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,830
No doubt, it's a girl.

130
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,077
It can't be!

131
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,191
Get dressed, you can go.

132
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,833
It can't be!

133
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,153
Come on, get dressed.

134
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,556
You have to leave.

135
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,516
I can't have a girl.

136
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,951
Please my love, please.

137
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,555
Please I beg you, please.

138
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,114

139
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,832
I am Sharmila's mother.

140
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,515
Sweetheart.

141
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,795
Please don't go.

142
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,788
You can't leave me alone, please.
