2
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,620
"Wonderful two eyes."

3
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,190
"Never tire waiting."

4
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,860
"Wonderful two eyes."

5
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:45,780
"Affection evident in them."

6
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:59,480
"Fondness oozes out of them.
Nothing is said."

7
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,260
"Rock me in your arms."

8
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,370
"Sing lullabies
and pat me to sleep."

9
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,950
"lf l get angry and cry.."

10
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:36,620
"..over a broken dream."

11
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,300
"l would make excuses.."

12
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:49,900
"..and sleep in your magical arms."

13
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,810
"Now fish don't sing."

14
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,110
"Nor does the banyan tree speak
in your absence."

15
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,730
Aunt? Please come in.

16
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
Everyone is fine. Have a seat.

17
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,260
How are you feeling? Good?

18
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,200
Do you have medicine or not?
You still have some?

19
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,100
Want a glass of water?

20
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,710
Have a seat. Be careful.

21
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,920
Do you want me to write
a letter for you?

22
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,490
You send so many letters.

23
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,920
But your son never replies.

24
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,190
l know that, aunt.

25
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,060
Your son has
made it big in the city.

26
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,930
He has no time to write to his mom.

27
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,210
Very well. l got it.

28
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,380
Old age and setting sun
have to fight darkness.

29
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,860
Being a professor
wouldn't have mattered much.

30
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,960
Education has become big business.

31
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,370
l can neither buy
nor sell anything.

32
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,430
Well, forget it.
Let's write a letter for you.

33
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,750
So you have bought a top for Diya?

34
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,490
Do you want to parcel it? l see.

35
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,400
lnk gives a soul to words.

36
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,260
There you are. Hear it out.

37
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,690
'Dear son Manoj. Bless you.'

38
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,770
'l hope all of you are fine.'

39
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,440
'l have been missing you.
l feel like meeting you.'

40
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,110
'l miss the kids a lot.'

41
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,310
'Come over with your wife
and kids for a couple of days.'

42
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,890
'l have cough since a few days.'

43
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,020
'l went to a doctor,
but it hasn't got better.'

44
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,460
'The doctor scares me
unnecessarily that my lungs..'

45
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,730
'But don't worry.'

46
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,800
'l won't live too long.'

47
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,570
'l wish to spend them
with the kids.'

48
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,470
'Let me know beforehand
when you plan to come over.'

49
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,640
'Son, don't overwork.'

50
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,720
'l always worry about your health.'

51
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,920
'l have prepared
mango poppadoms for Diya.'

52
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,060
'l bought a top from the fair too.
l am sending it along.'

53
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,160
'Don't scold your kids.
They are very nice.'

54
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,860
'l send my love to the kids
and blessings to your wife.'

55
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,870
'Your mom.'

56
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,460
Do you want
to send these 'laddoos' too?

57
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,200
Had my mom been around..

58
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,750
Not everyone is lucky
to have such affection.

59
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,360
Aunt, l don't want money.
Keep it away.

60
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,460
Knowledge and wealth
are two opposites.

61
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,870
Very well.

62
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,130
lt's the 1st. You'll go
to the bank to get your pension.

63
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,870
There will be a long queue.

64
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:17,490
"Rock me in your arms."

65
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:24,670
"Sing lullabies
and pat me to sleep."

66
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:51,490
"Showered your blessings on me
without my knowledge."

67
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:04,830
"Like a lamp in darkness you are.
l do not fear the dark."

68
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:11,510
"l do not have the pleasure of cushion
of your arms and all those dreams.."

69
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,910
"..in your absence."

70
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,060
"Rock me in your arms."

71
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,430
"Sing lullabies
and pat me to sleep."

72
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,560
Ma'am, l have a parcel for you.

73
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,510
Uncle, l want a compass.

74
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,490
This one is good.

75
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,900
Rs. 120.

76
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,710
Uncle, the printed price
is Rs. 110.

77
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,770
Give me Rs. 40 back.

78
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,300
Mom, l want grandma's photograph.

79
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,670
- Mom, l want grandma's photograph!
- Why?

80
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,570
We have a school project
on grandmother.

81
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,310
Look for it in the album.

82
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,210
That is a big photograph.
l want a small one.

83
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,570
So what can l do?
Should l bring your grandma here?

84
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,990
- Dad.
- Yes?

85
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,430
l want a small photograph
of grandma.

86
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,000
We have a school project
on grandmother.

87
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,630
l have to write about grandma
and paste her picture.

88
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,810
l don't think we have
a small photograph of your grandma.

89
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,400
But let me tell you
about your grandma.

90
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,080
When l was small..

91
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,450
..she would travel great distances on
foot to buy green vegetables for me.

92
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,580
She wasn't educated,
but everyone would seek her advice.

93
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,590
She still helps everyone.

94
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,660
Go finish your project.
l'll finish reading my book.

95
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,360
Everything is fine, aunt.
l had come to the market.

96
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,030
l bought vegetables at the market.

97
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,260
l got really fresh vegetables.

98
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,040
Are you weaving
a sweater for Diya? l see.

99
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,670
No, be seated.

100
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,230
l had been home. l have had
snacks and tea. Don't bother.

101
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,580
Did your son reply to your letter?

102
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,190
Aunt, l am thinking about
buying a car this year.

103
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,010
lt would fun to take the kids
for a long drive.

104
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,700
You too come long.
We'll have great fun.

105
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,320
l bought radish
and spinach for you.

106
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,320
These looked fresh.
So l brought these for you.

107
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,210
Okay. l take your leave.

108
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,270
l was watching a match.
Matches aren't shown everyday.

109
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,170
Food is served.
You may eat whenever you want.

110
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,350
They had scored two goals.

111
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,080
Papa, Manchester United has Rooney.

112
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,080
- Manchester United will win today.
- Really? Let's see.

113
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,260
Mom, why don't we bring
grandma to Mumbai?

114
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,300
Because Mumbai is overcrowded.

115
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,930
But grandma will live at our house.

116
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,670
We will be having
full time maid from Monday.

117
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,270
Where will she stay
if grandma comes over?

118
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,610
Besides, we don't have much room.

119
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,850
Grandma can stay in our room.

120
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,590
Stop thinking such things
and finish your food.

121
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,390
Mom, why don't you make laddoos
like grandma does?

122
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,450
l don't know how to!

123
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,530
Your grandma needs an excuse
to come to Mumbai.

124
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:05,870
Besides, big houses and
fresh air suits old people.

125
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,410
Your grandma
has everything over there.

126
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,340
She won't get that here.

127
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,340
Let me tell you one thing.

128
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,580
l was told that you talk
to strangers while going to school.

129
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,190
You are too young for that.

130
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,960
Who messed with my cupboard?

131
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,340
l was looking for
grandma's photograph.

132
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,540
You messed up my cupboard
for a photograph?

133
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,980
You should've thrown
my clothes in the street.

134
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,570
Prakhar and you
will set my cupboard right.

135
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,910
You will clean the house.
Got that?

136
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,090
All you know is to play and eat.

137
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,260
- Kavita!
- Yes, Manoj?

138
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,820
- Where are you?
- What do you want?

139
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,870
Listen, send my brown and
black suits to the laundry.

140
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,990
l might have to go to Japan
in a couple of days.

141
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,350
Kanta Devi?
These are grandma's letters.

142
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,220
Yes.

143
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,260
These haven't been opened.

144
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,840
Brother, please answer
this question.

145
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,510
There you are.

146
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,580
A disease caused by an uncontrolled
division of abnormal cells..

147
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,590
..in a part of our body.

148
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,960
Something evil or destructive.

149
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,100
That is hard to contain or destroy.

150
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,890
lt is a serious illness.

151
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,100
lt could be fatal.

152
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,870
lt could be fatal?

153
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,550
Switch off the TV in 10 minutes
and do your homework.

154
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,920
l'm going out.

155
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,390
- Mom, where are you going?
- To buy some vegetables.

156
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,050
- What's wrong, Diya?
- Shall we show those letters to papa?

157
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,920
What if mom finds out
that we opened the letter?

158
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,220
Do we let grandma
be in pain forever?

159
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,230
lf she comes here,
papa will take her to a hospital.

160
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,500
All right. Don't blame me
if something goes wrong.

161
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,520
- Papa!
- Dear, not now. Some other time.

162
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,150
l'm busy right now.

163
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,470
l don't want anyone else
in my house.

164
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,270
l need freedom in my house.

165
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,780
- Let your mom be where she is.
- lsn't this my home?

166
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,420
lf my mom comes over,
it would be an end to your freedom.

167
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,690
Your mom can come here any time,
but you don't want my mom here.

168
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:50,390
All right then.
l will leave the house.

169
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,230
Don't trouble me.
l have to prepare my presentation.

170
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,100
l have become
a money making machine.

171
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,930
We'll go for a morning walk
with papa in the morning.

172
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,700
We'll give him all the letters.
Mom will never know.

173
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,330
Why don't you give them to him now?

174
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,910
Mom is with him in the room.

175
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:43,240
Take the letters and
place them on papa's table.

176
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,190
What if papa doesn't find them?

177
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:56,020
l'm not interested
in going for a jog in the morning.

178
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,510
Where are you going so early?

179
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,940
l want to go for a walk with papa.

180
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,770
Papa? He took
last night's flight to Japan.

181
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,850
- When will he return?
- ln two weeks.

182
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,060
Mom hates grandma.

183
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,650
Yes. Mom is not interested.

184
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,200
We'll have to bring grandma here.

185
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,100
How can we do that?

186
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,730
We'll have to go to Goa?

187
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,100
Goa? Mom will kill us.

188
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,870
Don't be scared. l'll be with you.

189
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,610
What? You don't even know
where Goa is.

190
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,340
Did Vasco Da Gamma know
where Goa is?

191
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,980
But still he reached there.

192
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,580
Vasco Da Gamma had
reached Calicut, not Goa.

193
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,650
Goa and Calicut are the same.

194
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,190
Brother, where is Calicut?

195
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,430
Let's go else we'll be late.
Walk fast.

196
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,450
We start from Mumbai and
go down South all the way to Goa.

197
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,090
- lt's not too far.
- How do we go there?

198
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,140
By train. We have a direct train
from CST Station to Goa.

199
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,900
Grandma will be with us
on our way back.

200
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,540
We can go tomorrow
and come back the next day.

201
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,070
No, l am scared.

202
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,620
Mom will report to the police
if we go missing.

203
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,910
How will the police know
we are going to Goa?

204
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,320
By the time they find out..

205
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,220
..we will be back.

206
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,780
No. Plan canceled.

207
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,130
Show grandma's letters
to papa when he comes back.

208
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,470
Will you let grandma die?

209
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,190
- What's wrong?
- Prakhar!

210
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,530
- What was that sound?
- Nothing, mom! The chair fell.

211
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,000
Hurry up.

212
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Come on, hurry up. Quickly!

213
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,460
Show me your ticket.

214
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,270
Mister, show me your ticket.

215
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,210
- Sir, l don't have a ticket.
- What?

216
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,870
Are you traveling without a ticket?

217
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,620
Lazy bones. We could have
bought tickets had you woken up early.

218
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,560
What's my fault?

219
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,990
Don't act too smart.

220
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,160
- What do we do now?
- How would l know?

221
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,350
Nice place.

222
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,920
Come on. lt's too hot. Let's go.

223
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,170
We need to go Goa.

224
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,580
- No, we need to go to Goa.
- Goa?

225
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,370
Are you seated?

No!

227
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,150
But l was not educated.

228
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,060
You too should get educated
and make it big.

229
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,040
Thank you.

230
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,930
He said a red color bus will come.

231
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,770
We have to ask the
conductor before boarding.

232
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,810
Okay.

233
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,220
He helped us but
l set his pigeons loose.

234
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,090
l made a mistake, didn't l brother?

235
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,830

is on gate number seven.

236
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,590

00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,420
The pigeon seller.

241
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,320
Brother! Brother!

242
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,240

l think he is dumb.

246
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,570
Yes, maybe.

247
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,420
Careful.

248
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,530
Wow! A tree of berries.

249
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,800
Let me pluck some.

250
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,970
Here they are.

Yes.

253
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:22,480

254
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:30,290

All right. Okay. See you.

Sir, my children have not
returned home since morning.

258

Otherwise he would

You are bound to get transferred.

Shinde, check his vehicle.
What does he have in it?

00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,500
Sir, check and see.

317
