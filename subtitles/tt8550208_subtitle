1
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,791
<i>The year is 1971.</i>

2
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,791
<i>This story is of the time when</i>
<i>Pakistan was divided in two parts.</i>

3
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,750
<i>West Pakistan and East Pakistan.</i>

4
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:26,166
<i>Today, East Pakistan</i>
<i>is known as Bangladesh.</i>

5
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,208
<i>The people of East Pakistan...</i>

6
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,500
<i>were upset with the brutality</i>
<i>of their government.</i>

7
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,500
<i>The cry for freedom was</i>
<i>reverberating across the country.</i>

8
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,625
<i>It led to the merciless slaughter</i>
<i>of thousands of innocent citizens.</i>

9
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,458
<i>There was an exodus of</i>
<i>refugees from East Pakistan...</i>

10
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,166
<i>who were trying to enter India.</i>

11
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,250
<i>In these circumstances,</i>

12
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,916
<i>even the Indian government</i>
<i>was in favor of East Pakistan's freedom.</i>

13
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:06,916
<i>Both the nations</i>
<i>were on the brink of a war.</i>

14
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,583
<i>Grandma, a peacock took your peahen</i>

15
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:46,208
<i>A crook took away what remained</i>

16
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,375
<i>I had started a project some time back.</i>

17
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,375
<i>I needed a person...</i>

18
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,916
<i>who could easily be sent...</i>

19
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,708
<i>across the border.</i>

20
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,458
<i>One man stood out amongst the others.</i>

21
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,125
<i>This man could change colors</i>
<i>like a chameleon.</i>

22
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,750
<i>He had the talent to blend in anywhere.</i>

23
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,291
And lastly, I would like to
say a few lines.

24
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,625
Please listen.

25
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,333
"Affection is something musical

26
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,083
Affliction is just like melody

27
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,541
The heart is a drop of blood

28
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,375
Its color is blushful

29
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,916
There is a desire in this color

30
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,708
And every desire is colorless"

31
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,875
Come in.

32
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,833
It was a fantastic performance, dude!

33
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,458
Thanks for the compliment, bugger!

34
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,291
I never imagined you could have
any talent besides counting money.

35
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:21,333
Thank God! You finally
found me worthy enough.

36
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,625
Shall we go, Romeo and Juliet?

37
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,625
We are getting late for the party.

38
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,375
Give me five minutes.

39
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,875
<i>Oh, Bulle Shah</i>

40
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,708
<i>Oh, Bulle Shah</i>

41
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,125
<i>Meet my eyes, dear</i>

42
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,500
<i>Let's stare at each other for some time,</i>
<i>My love</i>

43
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,250
<i>I am mesmerized by your beauty</i>

44
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,000
<i>Meet my eyes, dear</i>

45
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,375
<i>Let's stare at each other for some time,</i>
<i>My love</i>

46
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,125
<i>It's an amazing feeling</i>

47
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:04,875
<i>It was my choice to surrender and die</i>

48
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,125
<i>The arrows of your beauty</i>
<i>Were launched at me</i>

49
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,708
<i>Your companionship is amazing</i>

50
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:17,083
<i>-Oh, Bulle Shah</i>
<i>-Where is my heart going?</i>

51
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:21,833
<i>-Oh, Bulle Shah</i>
<i>-Where is my heart going?</i>

52
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,875
<i>-Oh, Bulle Shah</i>
<i>-Where is my heart going?</i>

53
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,500
<i>Be the shower of love</i>

54
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:35,708
<i>Be mine</i>
<i>I have left the world for you</i>

55
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,250
<i>Your eyes are so pretty</i>

56
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:44,041
<i>Embraced with kohl,</i>
<i>I dwell in your eyes</i>

57
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,916
<i>Look around</i>
<i>There are signs everywhere</i>

58
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:53,375
<i>I don't say anything</i>
<i>But everyone does</i>

59
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:57,000
<i>Your companionship is amazing</i>

60
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:01,166
<i>-Oh, Bulle Shah</i>
<i>-Where is my heart going?</i>

61
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,333
-Parul.
<i>-Oh, Bulle Shah</i>

62
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,041
I think it's been two months
that I have been asking you.

63
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,000
Shall we go for a movie tomorrow?

64
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,916
I promise I will not hold your hand.

65
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,833
Whose hand will you hold then?

66
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:24,666
<i>You add colors to my life</i>

67
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:29,083
<i>You fill me with happiness</i>

68
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,666
<i>Your companionship is amazing</i>

69
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,791
<i>-Oh, Bulle Shah</i>
<i>-Where is my heart going?</i>

70
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:41,666
<i>-Oh, Bulle Shah</i>
<i>-Where is my heart going?</i>

71
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,416
<i>-Oh, Bulle Shah</i>
<i>-Where is my heart going?</i>

72
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:54,708
Mom.

73
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why didn't you sleep yet?

74
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,250
I had told you I would be late.

75
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,625
The bank had a...

76
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,916
Mom!

77
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,833
My loving mother!

78
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:10,916
Stop with the drama.

79
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,583
Have you eaten?

80
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,916
Mom, would I ever give up
your stale and burnt rotis?

81
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,208
Stand up.

82
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:19,958
Stand up!

83
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,041
Stand straight.
Don't move.

84
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,875
Mom, did you have dinner?

85
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,541
Have I ever eaten without you?

86
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,833
Warm up the <i>halwa</i> for me.

87
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,750
Tell me something,
how do you get time for theatre?

88
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,875
-I--
-The manager is looking for you.

89
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:19,791
Go.

90
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,166
Ram Singh, give me a cup of tea.

91
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,916
What happened to your leave application?

92
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,375
Can't you see the kettle
dangling from my hand?

93
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,166
My request is dangling--

94
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,166
-Put your hands up!
-Put your hands up!

95
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,708
Where are the keys?

96
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,000
-Put your hands up!
-Where are the keys?

97
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,208
Put your hands up!

98
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,833
Stand straight!

99
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:43,958
Where are the keys?

100
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,041
Where are the keys to the safe?

101
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,541
-Can't you hear?
-Where are the keys?

102
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,666
Where are the keys to the safe?

103
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,500
-Where are the keys to the safe?
-Can't you hear?

104
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,541
Put your hands up!

105
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,208
-Come on!
-Put your hands up!

106
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,583
Where are the keys to the safe?
Put your hands up!

107
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,125
Where are the keys to the safe?
Put your hands up!

108
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,416
Ratan, pick up the gun!

109
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,791
Parul, call the police!

110
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,291
Come here!

111
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,250
<i>Asset taken.</i>

112
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,625

<i>son of Subedar Major Gulrez Ali.</i>

114
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:42,083
He was martyred in the
1962 Indo-China war.

115
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,625
Vir Chakra awardee.

116
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,958
Your father was your favorite hero.

117
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,041
You wanted to follow
his footsteps and join the IMA.

118
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:59,000
But after your father's death
your mother forbade you from doing so.

119
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,375
Where are the keys to the safe?

120
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,208
-Put your hands up!
-Put your hands up!

Youâ€¦

123
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,166
All of this?

124
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,375
I want to prepare you
for a kind of performance...

125
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,916
which can change India's future.

126
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,958
<i>I know it will not be easy for you</i>

<i>Your life begins and ends</i>

129
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,875

You are earlier than usual!

134
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:48,833
Yes, Mom.

135
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,833
Your father had taken us to Delhi

136
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,125
to witness the Republic Day parade.

137
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:47,166
You started saluting as soon as
the national anthem played.

138
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,125
Mom, I have been promoted.

139
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,958
The bank is sending me for
training for a few months.

140
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,500
Sending you?

141
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,333
What will I do here?

142
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,208
It's only a matter of a few months.

143
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:21,958
Please serve me food.

144
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,125
<i>Only one factor determines</i>
<i>whether wars are won or lost.</i>

145
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,583
<i>What, when and where is</i>
<i>the enemy planning?</i>

146
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,666
You will be staying in this house.

147
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,833
There is something unique about
Mohammad's tea and this place.

148
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:23,665
You are looking at things
but can you really see them?

149
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,916
You will need to get used to observing
nuances in a single glance.

150
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,666
Tell me something
about your childhood, Romeo.

151
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,083
Me and Dad...

152
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,166
Sir, I think you know
more about my childhood.

153
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,833
Anyway.

154
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,208
Dad loved trekking.

155
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,500
And Mom...

156
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,875
She avoids walking.

157
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,125
Did you observe anything?

158
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,416
It crossed us twice.

159
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,541
I never thought you would
be following my editorial.

160
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,125
I have to follow it.

161
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,208
How come you are here so early?

162
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,750
I have an interview with Madam.

163
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,000
Placing a field agent
in such a hostile area and...

164
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,958
that too in this position--

165
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,000
Sir, in order to gather solid intel...

166
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,208
we need to take some risk.

167
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,583
But, at what cost?

168
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,708
Along with this project, you are
risking so much personally.

169
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,250
Well!

170
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:11,875
I shall sign it...

171
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,291
as you came here with Madam's approval.

172
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,750
The responsibility for this project
is yours and...

173
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,583
only yours.

174
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,583
After independence,
I was a soldier in the Indian Army.

175
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:46,958
Romeo,

176
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,125
we are among the few fortunate ones...

177
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,125
who got a chance to serve their country.

178
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,208
Always remember and respect this honor.

179
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,083
You are being sent on
an undercover mission.

180
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,791
You will have to keep in mind...

181
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:13,125
If I say your tea is cold,

182
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,875
then I'm actually trying to
tell you that you don't need to drink it.

183
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,583
You will never be spoken to in a
straight forward manner.

184
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:28,000
You will have to interpret the truth
and understand it.

185
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,083
And what if I'm not able to do that?

186
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,166
It will be easier to find your way out.

187
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,958
I'll be with you at every stage.

188
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,000
Stop the bus.

189
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,500
Stop.

190
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,125
Show me your ID.

191
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:06,625
Show me your ID.

192
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,625
You are trying to enter the
country with forged documents!

193
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,125
He seems to be an Indian.

194
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,166
Take him away and
investigate him thoroughly.

195
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,458
Show me your ID.

196
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,000
<i>You do not exist in the records anymore.</i>

197
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:19,041
<i>Your new identity will be...</i>
<i>Akbar Malik.</i>

198
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,333
<i>Akbar is a Pakistani Kashmiri</i>
<i>living in POK.</i>

199
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:28,291
<i>His parents were killed eight years ago</i>
<i>in a cross fire at the border.</i>

200
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:13,791
<i>Akbar works as an</i>
<i>Assistant Manager at POK Hotel.</i>

201
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,791
<i>For work purpose,</i>

202
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,875
<i>an important guest is coming from Karachi</i>
<i>to stay at the hotel.</i>

203
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:23,500
<i>Isaq Afridi.</i>

204
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:27,708
<i>A Pakistani who loves</i>
<i>his country more than himself.</i>

205
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,541
<i>He is very close to the</i>
<i>Chief of the Pakistan Army...</i>

206
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,208
<i>and a key for your lock.</i>

207
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,333
Thank you, Akbar Malik.

208
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,833
<i>-Assalamu alaikum.</i>
<i>-Wa alaykumu as-salam.</i>

209
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,375
In the last four months, there have been
two attempts to assassinate Isaq Afridi.

210
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:07,958
Those who know have said
that there is only one person...

211
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,916
behind the attacks.

212
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:13,208
His son, Nawab Afridi.

213
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:26,625
Just a minute, sir.

214
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:49,250
Dear, what's with the tape
on your fingers?

215
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,583
I like to fly kites.

216
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,125
This is one of the rewards
for cutting others' kites.

217
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,708
I like to fly kites as well.

218
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:03,041
Let's have a duel
whenever we get the time.

219
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:07,916
Then we shall see who
rules over the skies.

220
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,708
<i>Inshallah,</i> of course.

221
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,833
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.

222
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:16,666
The kitchen is closed and
the chef has left as well.

223
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,375
No problem.

224
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:24,500
Mr. Afridi, if it's alright with you,
I can take you outside for dinner.

225
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:25,833
Where are you planning to take me?

226
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,041
Somewhere nearby.

227
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,333
There is a shop owned by
Khan Chacha at Rusul Street.

228
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,875
Their meat delicacy is--

229
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:31,791
Wow!

230
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,375
I hope you are not a spy.

231
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:37,583
You know everything about me.

232
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,250
Are you a local resident?

233
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,666
Yes, Mr. Afridi.

234
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,125
My house is beyond the mountains there.

235
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,291
You stay near the border.

236
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:51,250
Yes, sir.

237
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:54,416
My father used to own a lot of property
across the border.

238
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,375
In India?

239
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:00,375
Not India, Kashmir.

240
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,125
India rendered us homeless.

241
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,583
And your parents?

242
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:12,416
They died eight years ago.

243
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,916
We had apple orchards here.

244
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,583
Apples!
Take some juicy apples!

245
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,666
Take some juicy apples!

246
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,875
How are you doing?
All good?

247
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:51,000
-What's your name?
-What's your name?

248
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:57,291
Take some juicy apples
for 25 paisa a kilo!

249
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,958
Take some juicy apples!

250
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,916
-Take some juicy apples!
-How much is it for?

251
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,666
Take some juicy apples!

252
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:45,416
Mr. Afridi!

253
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:48,250
I'm fine.

254
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:51,041
Nawab followed us here as well.
For how long we will remain silent?

255
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,875
Brother!

256
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,708
Thank God, you are fine.

257
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,625
We will care for you much better

258
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,791
than government hospitals.

259
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:35,000
You will not be bothered
by the police here.

260
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,500
I came to know from the hotel...

261
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,541
that you had already resigned.

262
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:46,166
They wanted to transfer me...

263
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:50,333
to a new branch, out of the country.

264
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,083
But I don't want to leave Pakistan.

265
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,250
Will you work with me?
In Karachi?

266
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,000
I will light a cigarette to signal that...

267
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,416
Isaq Afridi is heading in your direction.

268
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:41,833
<i>When you reach Karachi, you'll</i>
<i>first meet a person...</i>

269
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,583
<i>known as Joker.</i>

270
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:48,125
<i>It's not just a name but a position.</i>

271
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:55,416
<i>This person runs the operation</i>
<i>for me in Pakistan.</i>

272
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,750
<i>Only I know</i>
<i>Joker's real identity and work.</i>

273
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:24,500
Akbar Malik.

274
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,375
Qureshi butchery.

275
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:28,916
In five minutes.

276
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:04,166
The cigarette packet is a way
to communicate with me.

277
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:09,000
Use it only when you fear being exposed,

278
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,666
or you need to meet the high command.

279
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:16,625
You will meet the high command only
through my secured network.

280
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:20,958
The details of your future movements
are in the cigarette packet.

281
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:24,125
This is our first and last meeting.

282
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,333
May I know your name?

283
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,500
Here's some advice.

284
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:38,708
Do not say anything
that can get you into trouble.

285
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,875
It will make your stay here a lot easier.

286
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:42,541
<i>Allah Hafiz.</i>

287
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,375
Liaqatabad! Liaqatabad!

288
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,083
-How much for the apples?
-Half a rupee for one kilo.

289
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,458
Give me a kilo.

290
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,625
Mr. Akbar!

291
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,750
How do you know my name?

292
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,375
Why were you following me?

293
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:28,916
I do not have the nerve to follow you.

294
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,125
I was just keeping an eye on you.

295
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,083
I was ensuring that
nobody is spying on you.

296
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,291
Joker has sent me.

297
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:36,458
Mudassar?

298
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:39,500
You are choking Mudassar.
I am your servant.

299
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:47,750
Welcome to Liaqatabad.

300
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:50,250
Come.

301
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:01,500
Come in.
This is your house.

302
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,291
What do you know about Joker?

303
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:11,500
Sir, the lesser
you know about him the better.

304
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,583
Please come.

305
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:23,625
This is your office.

306
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,333
<i>You are tuned in to Akashvani.</i>

307
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:36,958
<i>You heard that beautiful</i>
<i>number requested by Mr. Iqbal.</i>

308
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:39,625
<i>Let's listen to the next requested track.</i>

309
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,208
This is your transmitter.

310
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,583
Come here.

311
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,666
Here, keep this for your safety.

312
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,458
I wish to God that
you may never have to use it.

313
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,208
Joker messaged.

314
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:41,708
<i>Oh, Allah</i>

315
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:47,041
<i>Oh, Allah</i>

316
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:52,750
Akbar!

317
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,333
Akbar!

318
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:02,583
I got you!

319
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:13,583
Sit.

320
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,791
With Allah's grace,
we have pulled off a massive arms deal.

321
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,375
It's a significant contract.

322
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:28,333
We need to make this delivery to
East Pakistan in seven days.

323
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,333
The rest of the details are in this.

324
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:37,625
Alright, sir.

325
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:06,666
How does Afridi get such contracts?

326
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:08,916
It is not that tough, sir.

327
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:12,666
The Chief of Army,
General Jahangir Alam...

328
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,708
gets a hefty percentage of every deal.

329
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:24,250
Their tie-up is dangerous for two people.

330
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:29,708
Isaq Afridi's son, Nawab Afridi...

331
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,833
and the one in Pakistan Army,

332
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:38,791
ISI chief,
Lieutenant General Ghazi Ali Hayat.

333
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:43,291
They are best friends.

334
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:47,333
They are just waiting for an opportunity

335
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:52,208
to replace the Chief of Army
and Isaq Afridi.

336
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:14,750
There is a message from Akbar.

337
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:17,000
A huge consignment of
arms is being delivered.

338
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:25,541
In East Pakistan, two units
of the Pakistan Army's

339
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:28,375
23rd Infantry Brigade have been spotted.

340
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,666
Chief, it seems like Pakistan
is preparing for a war.

341
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:43,750
They are planning something else, Awasthi.

342
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,875
Javed, please put it carefully.

343
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:30,291
-Mr. Rafique.
-Yes.

344
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,416
What's with the army contingent
in our office?

345
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,041
General Jahangir is coming
to our office.

346
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:35,500
The General?

347
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:37,041
There must be something important.

348
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:08,208
Miss?

349
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:12,625
Miss, please clean up outside.

350
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,750
Mr. Siddique,
without a thorough review Iâ€¦

351
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:14,208
Mr. Afridi,
I was talking to Mr. Siddiqueâ€¦

352
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,625
Later.

353
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:21,625
Mr. Siddique, I'll speak to you later.

354
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:26,208
Excuse me.

355
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:28,708
Come, sir.

356
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,958
-Hot and roasted chickpeas!
-The bus is here.

357
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,750
Can I have some?

358
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:15,750
Here, sir.

359
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:23,791
Hot and roasted chickpeas!

360
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:38,875
The birth date of
India's Father of the Nation.

361
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,666
The birth place of Gautama Buddha.

362
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,708
Joker messaged.

363
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,291
Akbar wants to meet me.

364
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:12,083
<i>Passengers of PIA's flight number 213</i>
<i>are requested to board the plane.</i>

365
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:16,708
Greetings.

366
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:20,250
<i>The spokesperson of the Mukti Bahini</i>

367
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,708
<i>has issued a statement from Badlipur.</i>

368
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:25,208
<i>Thousands of citizens...</i>

369
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:30,750
<i>have taken up weapons for the</i>
<i>liberation of East Pakistan.</i>

370
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,625
There may be a storm brewing.

371
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:10,125
In such a situation,
I might need a companion.

372
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:30,958
Is there any
particular reason for meeting me?

373
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:32,291
My mother.

374
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:35,583
Whatever happens tomorrow...

375
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,750
my mother should always be taken care of.

376
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,041
We will always take care of her.

377
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:17,250
"My loving mother..."

378
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:34,458
<i>The situation in East Pakistan</i>
<i>is getting even worse.</i>

379
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:39,041
The Mukti Bahini has all areas
under their control near Badlipur.

380
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:40,833
<i>The Indian Army is</i>

381
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:43,291
-Hands straight!
<i>-training the rebels there.</i>

382
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,625
Ready to shoot!

383
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:50,458
<i>And to fight against us in this war...</i>

384
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:56,291
<i>India is even sneaking in arms to</i>
<i>East Pakistan through Badlipur.</i>

385
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:03,000
Badlipur, a small village at the border,

386
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,166
has turned cancerous for us.

387
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:12,333
<i>Mr. Afridi, in such situations,</i>

388
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:16,291
<i>we have to remove the tumor from the body,</i>
<i>regardless of what we want.</i>

389
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,500
We'll destroy Badlipur
through an airstrike...

390
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:25,041
<i>from Abdulabad air base in East Pakistan.</i>

391
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:31,958
<i>We will neither attack the enemy territory</i>
<i>nor violate their airspace.</i>

392
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:33,291
<i>That's it.</i>

393
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:37,583
In one fell swoop, we'll destroy
the enemy's biggest strength.

394
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:40,625
All this without starting a war.

395
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,541
We are cleaning the waste
from our own house.

396
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,666
Even if they want,
they cannot do anything about it.

397
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:50,458
The world cannot know about the
involvement of the Pakistan government...

398
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:54,666
or our military in this operation.

399
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,625
I want your help to make this happen.

400
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,166
We need Dakota plane, cluster
bombs and non-Pakistani pilots.

401
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:16,875
<i>Operation Badlipur... is a critical</i>
<i>and top-secret mission.</i>

402
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,625
We will carry out this operation on
the night of November 22...

403
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,541
when India would be celebrating Diwali.

404
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:29,666
When the infidels celebrate Diwali,

405
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,666
we will burst some loud crackers.

406
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:36,875
The arms contract...

407
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:39,875
and the infantry battalion movement...

408
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,083
They were distracting us at
the ground level.

409
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:50,625
But they were planning to wipe out
Badlipur with an airstrike.

410
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,666
Many innocents will lose their lives.

411
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:00,416
Besides, our army members
outnumber the locals there.

412
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,875
And you know that we cannot
initiate the war...

413
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:33,291
When is Madam attending
the UN Assembly meet?

414
00:54:35,916 --> 00:54:38,875
She will attend the conference
in Geneva on November 20.

415
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:40,625
That's two days before Diwali.

416
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:18,000
Three days ago,
the Dhaka University was attacked.

417
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:22,125
The Pakistani soldiers slaughtered
22 scholars and students.

418
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,833
This file has all the
details of that incident.

419
00:55:58,875 --> 00:55:59,750
Rehana.

420
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:07,541
I want you to publish this news two days
before Diwali, on November 20.

421
00:56:08,916 --> 00:56:10,333
Neither a day before,
nor a day after.

422
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:26,375
Awasthi.

423
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:33,416
With this news, the entire world
will have its eyes on Pakistan.

424
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:48,791
If they still go ahead with their plan
to kill Indians in Badlipurâ€¦

425
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:58,000
And to avoid this,

426
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,458
they will be left with only one option.

427
00:57:03,916 --> 00:57:05,500
And that is to stop bombing Badlipur.

428
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,416
Aunty, he has written that
he has been promoted.

429
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:34,416
He has a bungalow and servants.
Life is good.

430
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:40,500
That's all?
Didn't he mention when is he coming back?

431
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:48,458
"I will be back soon. You haven't
hit me for quite some time now."

432
00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:01,208
Allah, please give him a long life.

433
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:11,958
Akbar Malik.

434
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,708
You need to come with us.

435
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:34,500
Come.

436
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:52,958
I hope you are fine, Mr. Akbar.

437
00:58:57,125 --> 00:59:00,041
Firstly, I'm sorry to call you this way.

438
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:04,041
Honestly speaking,
I was eager to meet you.

439
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,250
Nawab Afridi.

440
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:08,500
Please have a seat.

441
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:14,333
No problem, Mr. Nawab.
I at least got to meet you.

442
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:15,416
So kind of you.

443
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:21,958
You won my father's heart
and now he has forgotten me.

444
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,458
Rest assured I am not
stopping you to work with him.

445
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:35,833
Just share some contract details
and some personal information.

446
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,875
In return,
you can have anything you want.

447
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:48,333
Mr. Nawab,
betraying one's trust for a price...

448
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:50,833
is not my nature.

449
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,583
As you wish.

450
00:59:58,166 --> 01:00:00,875
But you cannot go without having
our famous pudding.

451
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:08,208
I'll be really upset.

452
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,208
<i>Khuda Hafiz.</i>

453
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,916
<i>Allah Hafiz.</i>

454
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:31,500
Mr. Nawab!

455
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,083
I think you forgot this envelope.

456
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,875
Thank you.

457
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,458
Actually, I wanted to deliver it
to room number 117.

458
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:44,291
I would really appreciate it
if you could do that for me.

459
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,250
Sure, Mr. Nawab.

460
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:49,375
And you are also invited to the feast.

461
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:52,833
We have organized a small party
at Continental Hotel.

462
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:54,250
-Sure.
-Thank you.

463
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:55,750
Let's go, Rehmat.

464
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:34,208
You?

465
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:50,791
Yes, sir.

466
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,458
I'll be there tomorrow.

467
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:57,083
I'll meet you there.

468
01:01:57,416 --> 01:01:58,250
Yes.

469
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:24,958
Nawab Afridi has sent this for you.

470
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,458
<i>Allah Hafiz.</i>

471
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:42,250
<i>At your altar, I pray</i>

472
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:49,333
<i>If not you,</i>
<i>Who else will I share my pain with?</i>

473
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:56,083
<i>If you don't hear me out,</i>
<i>Who else will?</i>

474
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,875
Mr. Nawab, she has come here
through the invitation you sent.

475
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,458
<i>Allah</i>

476
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:13,000
<i>I seek your help, Allah</i>

477
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:16,666
<i>The right of God, light from Allah,</i>
<i>You are my God</i>

478
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:20,250
<i>-You are the messenger of God</i>
<i>-Oh, Allah</i>

479
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:23,750
<i>-You are my dear God</i>
<i>-Oh, Allah</i>

480
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,791
<i>-You are the purest</i>
<i>-Oh, Allah</i>

481
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:30,083
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

482
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:33,583
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

483
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:37,291
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

484
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:40,708
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

485
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:44,375
<i>Peace be upon him</i>

486
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:49,291
So, I was the reason that you
were working in the bank?

487
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:58,125
<i>I shed tears</i>

488
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:05,208
<i>If not you,</i>
<i>Who else will I share my pain with?</i>

489
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,583
But the telephone in your hotel room?

490
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:12,875
They doubt on every Indian diplomat.

491
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,416
Why are you here?

492
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:22,125
You needed a partner in this season.

493
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:28,250
<i>Slowly, the world changes</i>

494
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:35,125
<i>Who knows what's right or wrong here?</i>

495
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:42,375
<i>The world is not what it looks like</i>

496
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:48,625
<i>Here, time doesn't wait for anyone</i>

497
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:51,291
You will continue to track Isaq Afridi.

498
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:55,041
The Pakistan Army and ISI
will be on my radar.

499
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:57,375
I'll be monitoring their every movement.

500
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:01,291
We need to stop
Operation Badlipur at any cost.

501
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:10,791
<i>You are Allah's beloved</i>

502
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,916
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

503
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:15,125
<i>You are my dear God</i>

504
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:17,125
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

505
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:19,375
<i>You are the purest</i>

506
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:21,458
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

507
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:23,500
<i>You are Allah's beloved</i>

508
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:25,833
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

509
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:30,416
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

510
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:36,875
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

511
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:44,625
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

512
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:49,791
<i>Oh, Messenger of Allah</i>

513
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,333
Romeo Ali.

514
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,750
I must admit, sir.

515
01:05:57,666 --> 01:06:01,791
Your government has carefully
chosen an excellent candidate.

516
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,291
Forget about me, tell me about yours.

517
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:06,916
Why is a Pakistani working
for an Indian intelligence agency?

518
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,416
What work?

519
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:14,541
I am only paying for my mistakes.

520
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:22,208
Actually, I acted stupid.

521
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:27,416
I was smoking ganja and
smuggling drugs on the border.

522
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:29,916
The BSF caught me.

523
01:06:31,166 --> 01:06:36,666
And I became a pawn in
the hands of Joker.

524
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:42,291
Haven't you ever thought of
leaving all this?

525
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:46,416
How can one consider that?

526
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:55,333
If they ever guess that I'm useless...

527
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:59,625
they will shoot me.

528
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:04,916
And I...

529
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:16,000
I don't want to leave
my little one all alone.

530
01:07:30,291 --> 01:07:31,958
You have reminded me
of my loved ones.

531
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:34,875
I'll be back.

532
01:07:58,416 --> 01:08:00,708
<i>Your clothes are ironed</i>
<i>and kept on the bed.</i>

533
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,625
I know you will take care of yourself.

534
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,666
Don't forget your mother.

535
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,375
You are my only son.

536
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:20,707
Mom, have you ever thought of
joining the theatre?

537
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:24,666
Are you mocking me?

538
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:44,957
Sir.

539
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:48,291
<i>-You?</i>
-Sir, here it is.

540
01:08:50,957 --> 01:08:52,457
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>
-Let them know.

541
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,582
<i>I'll be there tomorrow.</i>

542
01:08:58,291 --> 01:09:00,957
<i>Nawab Afridi has sent this for you.</i>

543
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:03,291
Hold on!

544
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:05,250
-Adil.
-Yes, sir.

545
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,750
Play it again.

546
01:09:07,957 --> 01:09:08,875
Sit.

547
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,375
<i>You?</i>

548
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,082
Who is this lady?

549
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:23,041
Shraddha Sharma.
She's an Indian diplomat.

550
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:24,125
When did she arrive?

551
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:25,875
Two nights ago.
It's her first posting.

552
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:26,832
Play it.

553
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:30,457
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

554
01:09:31,457 --> 01:09:32,791
<i>I'll see you there tomorrow.</i>

555
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:39,041
<i>You?</i>

556
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,916
Listen to the word "you" carefully.

557
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:53,625
<i>You?</i>

558
01:09:54,041 --> 01:09:56,375
This person already knew her.

559
01:10:02,916 --> 01:10:03,916
Thank you.

560
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:05,583
That's all.

561
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:11,833
Mr. Afridi...

562
01:10:13,416 --> 01:10:14,250
yesterday I--

563
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:15,416
You met Nawab.

564
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:20,000
And he tried to buy your loyalty.

565
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,250
This has not happened
for the first time, Akbar.

566
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:25,375
But, yes...

567
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:32,000
you are the first one
to give him an adamant reply.

568
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:34,416
You...

569
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,625
I am his father.

570
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:40,041
Akbar,

571
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:44,708
I see a glimpse in you of...

572
01:10:46,458 --> 01:10:49,291
what I always wanted to see in my son.

573
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:56,791
<i>Assalamu alaikum,</i> Mr. Nawab.

574
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:59,541
<i>Masha Allah!</i>
<i>Wa alaykumu as-salam.</i>

575
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:00,708
Please take a seat.

576
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,750
Iqbal, please get two cups of tea.

577
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:05,916
Mr. Nawab,

578
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:09,958
did you send somebody with an
envelope to the hotel yesterday?

579
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:12,500
Yes, Akbar Malik.

580
01:11:12,666 --> 01:11:13,625
Why?

581
01:11:16,208 --> 01:11:19,041
Akbar, we have been entrusted
with a huge responsibility.

582
01:11:20,541 --> 01:11:22,666
A Dakota plane.

583
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:29,041
And non-Pakistani pilots.

584
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:34,208
We need to arrange these
before November 22.

585
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:35,666
Fine, sir.

586
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:40,333
Akbar Malik.

587
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:46,916
A Pakistani Kashmiri comes to
Karachi and works for Isaq Afridi.

588
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:51,250
He works so brilliantly
that in three months...

589
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:53,625
he impresses the top circles.

590
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:57,541
Khan, his papers and
documents are in order.

591
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:59,375
-Just because you suspect him--
-Sir!

592
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:03,458
Sir, such extraordinary growth?

593
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:05,500
He seems to be part of a conspiracy.

594
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:08,958
I want to keep him under
top-level surveillance.

595
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:09,958
Please sanction it.

596
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,041
I'll need clearance from
the higher authority.

597
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:16,125
He is close to Isaq Afridi.

598
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,583
Considering that General Jahangir
and Isaq Afridi are close...

599
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:22,541
this will not be easy.

600
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,375
Please try to understand my problem.

601
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:28,166
Three months.

602
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:32,208
In just three months, he has become
the right-hand man of Isaq Afridi.

603
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,541
Nothing harsh.

604
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,833
Ensure that nobody gets to
know about it.

605
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:48,875
Yes, sir.

606
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:53,000
-Latif.
-Yes, sir.

607
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:57,708
Activate the high frequency
wireless detectors in Liaqatabad.

608
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:58,833
Okay.

609
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,750
-Tap Akbar Malik's phone.
-Okay, sir.

610
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:03,000
-Immediately.
-Yes, sir.

611
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:07,708
Give that to me.
Take this.

612
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:12,000
No, not there.
Keep it near the door.

613
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,541
Akbar.

614
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:26,875
We can't meet here like this.
You know--

615
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:30,250
I have been asked to make arrangements
for Operation Badlipur.

616
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,208
What was the need to take such a risk?

617
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:40,083
You could have sent it through somebody.

618
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:43,125
One feels like meeting
some people in person.

619
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:50,875
-Miss, I have kept all the boxes.
-Yes, I am coming.

620
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,958
Romeo Ali.
That's the name, right?

621
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,041
Your field agent has done wonders.

622
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:03,708
The intel on Operation Badlipur
is pure gold.

623
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:10,708
In the light of these developments,
his role has become very critical.

624
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:14,083
Can he really be trusted?

625
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:22,916
You very well know that even
today there are many Muslims who--

626
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,875
Mr. Surve, he's just an Indian for me.

627
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:29,250
Not a Hindu or a Muslim.

628
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:31,791
That's what you think.

629
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:35,958
But the question is,
what does he think?

630
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:40,833
-Hello.
-Hello.

631
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:42,250
Madam was waiting for you.

632
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:43,375
Please come.

633
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:47,250
-This one has too much recoil.
-Okay.

634
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,250
-It is jerking a bit.
-Okay.

635
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:54,916
<i>-Assalamu alaikum.</i>
<i>-Wa alaykumu as-salam.</i>

636
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,291
This is the quotation.

637
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:00,708
The pilot and the plane
have been arranged.

638
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:05,000
Money is not a thing
to worry about for patriots.

639
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:09,416
Akbar, one important thing.

640
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:12,833
The date has been changed.

641
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,791
Instead of November 22,
the plane...

642
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:20,458
should land on 19th morning
at Abdulabad air base.

643
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:26,083
Its next flight should be on that
very night at 10:30 p.m.

644
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,083
Sir.

645
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:54,375
<i>The time right now is 08:00 p.m.</i>
<i>Let's move on to our next request...</i>

646
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:57,583
Is the bombing on the night of the 19th?

647
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,041
According to our plan...

648
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,750
the media story was to
break on the 20th morning.

649
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,750
But now, they would have already
carried out the attack by then.

650
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:11,875
That means our plan...

651
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:26,541
They're getting to know everything.

652
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,291
That's why the bombing is now on
the 19th instead of 22nd.

653
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:33,583
But Chief...

654
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:37,916
the only people who knew about
the media story were you, me andâ€¦

655
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,875
<i>Today,</i>
<i>former Prime Minister Gulzari Lal Nanda</i>

656
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:46,291
<i>criticized Indira Gandhi.</i>

657
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:52,541
<i>He accused her of dictatorially</i>
<i>misusing the intelligence agencies.</i>

658
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,625
<i>For further comments...</i>

659
01:16:59,458 --> 01:17:00,500
Why are you here?

660
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:02,375
Under whose orders?

661
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:25,000
Heavy rains in this season!

662
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:28,916
Not really.

663
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:35,666
There are many places where
it rains heavily in this season.

664
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:40,416
Awasthi.

665
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:45,000
Arrange an urgent meeting for me
with the Mukti Bahini leaders.

666
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:46,208
In Calcutta?

667
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,333
Rehana Kazmi has--

668
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:56,541
Put East Pakistan on low profile.

669
01:18:56,791 --> 01:19:01,416
Do exactly the opposite
of what we had planned.

670
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:39,583
Why the sudden meeting?

671
01:19:39,666 --> 01:19:41,416
There's a message from the high command.

672
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:45,625
Stop whatever we are doing to
prevent Operation Badlipur.

673
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:46,708
But...

674
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:50,708
There are only five days
to Operation Badlipur.

675
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:51,833
But the high command has
sent a clear--

676
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:55,041
Not five, only four days.

677
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,166
Today is November 15.

678
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:02,375
My mother's birthday.

679
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:07,916
Coming to Pakistan has made me realize...

680
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:12,750
how much I miss my loved ones.

681
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:21,916
With your company, I feel a bit better.

682
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:38,333
<i>Let me be confined in your love</i>

683
01:20:39,583 --> 01:20:43,583
<i>Let me devour it</i>

684
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:48,166
<i>Let me drink all the love</i>

685
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:52,291
<i>I see in your eyes</i>

686
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:57,125
<i>Let me have it</i>

687
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:01,541
<i>Let me hear everything</i>

688
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:05,333
<i>Your soul wants to say</i>

689
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:09,833
<i>Let me revel in it</i>

690
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:14,166
<i>Let me be confined in your love</i>

691
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:18,625
<i>Let me devour it</i>

692
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:46,666
Sir!

693
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:51,375
-When?
-At eight o'clock.

694
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:56,666
Yes.

695
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:24,791
Come in.

696
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:27,375
Sir.

697
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:30,000
Sir, yesterday at 08:00 p.m.

698
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:32,541
high frequency signals were detected
through the wireless detectors.

699
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:34,291
A message is sent to India.

700
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:37,125
Triangulate it.

701
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,375
We have done it, sir.

702
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:40,208
The message was sent from Liaqatabad.

703
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:44,708
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

704
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:45,916
<i>Liaqatabad.</i>

705
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:48,500
Akbar Malik stays there as well.

706
01:22:56,916 --> 01:23:00,208
I am not lying. You can
inquire anywhere in the city.

707
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:02,375
They can't be
more sweet and juicy than these.

708
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:03,666
I swear by God.

709
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:14,833
Ma'am, somebody has sent these for you.

710
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:48,416
Sir.

711
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,541
The phone in Akbar's cabin
is ringing continuously.

712
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:53,666
Where's the call coming from?

713
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:55,958
Somewhere nearby the Indian Embassy.

714
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:13,875
<i>Assalamu alaikum.</i>

715
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,958
Akbar...

716
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,291
I needed your signature
on the consignment sheet.

717
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:38,416
Right here.

718
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,583
-Mr. Afridi is looking for you.
-Okay.

719
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:16,208
Sir, as soon as you left somebody
started calling Akbar continuously.

720
01:25:16,291 --> 01:25:17,750
<i>The call was made from somewhere nearby</i>
<i>the Indian Embassy.</i>

721
01:25:19,791 --> 01:25:20,833
Drive faster.

722
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:30,416
One unit is heading towards Liaqatabad.

723
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:08,041
Akbar Malik.

724
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:09,833
Sir, he's not at home.

725
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:16,541
Sir!

726
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:17,666
Listen to me, sir.

727
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:19,291
-Check outside.
-Sir!

728
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:20,958
-Check outside.
-Sir.

729
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:23,958
Sir!

730
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:25,875
Go there.

731
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:35,458
Sir, what is the matter?

732
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:55,583
<i>The show is called Chhaya Geet.</i>
<i>This is your host Shahnaz Mantri.</i>

733
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:58,541
<i>Let's begin the show...</i>

734
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:01,958
I like listening to Indian film songs.

735
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:04,291
-Is it?
-Yes.

736
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:07,166
<i>Let's talk about love.</i>

737
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:08,708
Step aside.

738
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:11,250
<i>Love is like a mix bag</i>
<i>of happiness and sorrow.</i>

739
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:16,250
<i>But since the weather is so pleasant,</i>
<i>let's not listen to sad love songs.</i>

740
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:39,833
<i>Grandma, a peacock took your peahen</i>

741
01:27:40,166 --> 01:27:44,500
<i>A crook took away what remained</i>

742
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:49,541
<i>Grandma, a peacock took your peahen</i>

743
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,500
<i>A crook took away what remained</i>

744
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:09,250
<i>After eating and drinking,</i>
<i>The crooks sat in a train</i>

745
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:14,041
<i>And cutting the box, as crooks do,</i>
<i>Ended up straight in jail</i>

746
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:30,583
With whose permission
are you breaking in my house?

747
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:33,708
Akbar Malik.

748
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:39,541
Let's go to the headquarters
for questioning.

749
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:40,833
Show me the warrant.

750
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,208
It is the police who need a warrant.

751
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:04,125
Akbar Malik.

752
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:06,041
Come.

753
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,375
Sit.

754
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,583
Switch on the light.

755
01:30:34,541 --> 01:30:36,166
You must be familiar with this.

756
01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:44,875
No?

757
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,541
Let me explain it to you.

758
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:07,916
How many fingers are
there in the right hand?

759
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:10,958
Five.

760
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:18,166
And in the left hand?

761
01:31:20,291 --> 01:31:21,125
Five.

762
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,125
What's your name?

763
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:34,791
What's your real name?

764
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:39,208
What's your name?

765
01:31:41,833 --> 01:31:42,833
Akbar Malik.

766
01:31:53,458 --> 01:31:56,541
You first met Shraddha Sharma in India.

767
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:57,583
No.

768
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:04,416
You are an Indian agent.

769
01:32:04,916 --> 01:32:05,750
No.

770
01:32:13,083 --> 01:32:14,750
You are in contact with Delhi.

771
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:16,000
No.

772
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:22,208
Your family is in Delhi.

773
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:23,375
No.

774
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:58,833
<i>Grandma, a peacock took your peahen</i>

775
01:34:16,666 --> 01:34:18,125
No, sir.
Nothing yet.

776
01:34:19,041 --> 01:34:21,250
He will spill everything.
Just give me some time.

777
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:24,625
<i>You can't use third degree torture.</i>
<i>You know the situation.</i>

778
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,083
Sir.

779
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:28,208
-I am confident that--
<i>-Khan!</i>

780
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:31,083
It's very important to
wait for the right time.

781
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:46,291
When we speak the truth,
our body reacts differently.

782
01:34:46,375 --> 01:34:47,958
And when we lie, our body
reacts in a different manner.

783
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,625
When we lie,
the body's stress level rises.

784
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:52,291
That helps them detect the lie.

785
01:34:53,166 --> 01:34:55,666
There is a way to crack
the polygraph test.

786
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:02,666
How many fingers are
there in the right hand?

787
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:11,458
Five.

788
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:15,416
<i>The stress level increases with pain.</i>

789
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:18,375
<i>There won't be much difference</i>
<i>between the truth and the lie.</i>

790
01:35:28,291 --> 01:35:31,875
Sir, leave the wounds open.
They will heal faster.

791
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:36,291
Colonel Khan is not going to stop.

792
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:39,083
But Joker is a bigger threat for you.

793
01:35:39,666 --> 01:35:44,208
He knows that you have got the
unwanted attention of the ISI.

794
01:35:44,875 --> 01:35:46,541
I will make a call to Delhi.

795
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:48,541
How will that help?

796
01:35:49,541 --> 01:35:52,791
Do you think they will risk the
entire network for a single pawn?

797
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:56,916
At this point,
you have just one resource.

798
01:35:57,708 --> 01:35:58,750
Isaq Afridi.

799
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:28,583
This Pathan will not let
anything happen to his child.

800
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:29,791
Nothing at all.

801
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:51,208
Akbar is a loyal citizen who
risked his life to save others.

802
01:36:52,416 --> 01:36:54,125
He has been tortured a lot.

803
01:36:58,041 --> 01:36:59,375
And who did it?

804
01:37:00,583 --> 01:37:01,541
General.

805
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:09,583
I am ashamed to tell you that
my son, Nawab, is responsible for this.

806
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:14,000
And for this impious quest...

807
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:18,125
he has teamed up with General Ghazi.

808
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:23,208
-Purpose?
-Akbar is my right-hand man.

809
01:37:23,541 --> 01:37:24,625
And they...

810
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:30,083
hate our cordial relationship.

811
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:43,625
-Ghazi, this--
-<i>Assalamu alaikum,</i> sir.

812
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:47,125
Since when you conduct
top-level surveillance

813
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:50,250
on Pakistani citizens without any reason?

814
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:53,250
-And that too without my permission.
-No, sir.

815
01:37:53,458 --> 01:37:55,250
Never without your permission.

816
01:37:55,541 --> 01:37:59,000
Then with whose permission did
you treat Akbar Malik so harshly?

817
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:01,291
Sir...

818
01:38:02,875 --> 01:38:04,875
I apologize but I do not
know anything about this.

819
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,416
Conduct an inquiry immediately.

820
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:10,333
Give me a report by tomorrow morning.

821
01:38:12,375 --> 01:38:13,208
Yes, sir.

822
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:31,375
-Send Colonel Khan immediately.
-Yes, sir.

823
01:38:57,583 --> 01:39:01,541
Akbar, you have turned the
situation in your favor.

824
01:39:04,333 --> 01:39:07,125
Isaq Afridi treats me like his son.

825
01:39:08,541 --> 01:39:09,583
And Iâ€¦

826
01:39:11,166 --> 01:39:12,083
Mister!

827
01:39:13,125 --> 01:39:15,750
Get this straight.

828
01:39:16,833 --> 01:39:19,541
You are not Akbar Malik but Romeo Ali.

829
01:39:20,458 --> 01:39:21,416
That's right.

830
01:39:22,083 --> 01:39:25,416
God forbid,
if you get emotionally involved,

831
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,208
you will be in trouble.

832
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:00,916
Why is everybody running helter-skelter?

833
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,833
Sir, haven't you heard the news?

834
01:40:02,916 --> 01:40:04,458
<i>This is a very sad news.</i>

835
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:06,166
<i>Today, at two in the afternoon,</i>

836
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:10,875
<i>Chief of Pakistan Army,</i>
<i>General Jahangir died in a bomb blast.</i>

837
01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:16,458
<i>Isaq Afridi, his close aide,</i>
<i>was killed in the blast as well.</i>

838
01:40:16,791 --> 01:40:20,125
<i>It is believed that this terror attack</i>

839
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:23,666
<i>was carried out by Akbar Malik.</i>

840
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:26,333
<i>He is known to have</i>
<i>connections with India.</i>

841
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:48,875
Akbar Malik is now trapped.

842
01:42:49,208 --> 01:42:50,083
Adil.

843
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:51,916
-Sir.
-Go get him.

844
01:43:01,583 --> 01:43:03,291
Out! Out!

845
01:43:15,958 --> 01:43:18,458
He's not here, sir.
I think he has escaped.

846
01:43:18,666 --> 01:43:19,500
What?

847
01:43:21,041 --> 01:43:22,416
That's impossible!

848
01:43:37,666 --> 01:43:38,958
Bastard!

849
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:40,958
Akbar Malik!

850
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:44,708
Bloody scoundrel!

851
01:44:33,625 --> 01:44:35,666
<i>ISI chief,</i>
<i>Lieutenant General Ghazi Ali Hayat</i>

852
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:39,583
<i>has been appointed as</i>
<i>Chief of the Pakistan Army.</i>

853
01:44:39,708 --> 01:44:42,041
<i>After taking over command,</i>

854
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:46,708
<i>he issued orders to capture</i>
<i>Akbar Malik alive at any cost.</i>

855
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:09,083
Mr. Akbar, what are you doing here?

856
01:45:09,958 --> 01:45:11,291
You shouldn't be here.

857
01:45:12,708 --> 01:45:15,041
Before anybody learns that you are here...

858
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,875
you should...

859
01:45:17,666 --> 01:45:19,958
cross the border and go back to India.

860
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:23,500
All the roads leading out are blocked.

861
01:45:24,833 --> 01:45:27,416
It's almost impossible
to cross the border.

862
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:31,041
Okay.

863
01:45:32,666 --> 01:45:36,333
Have a seat.
I'll get some tea for you.

864
01:46:49,625 --> 01:46:50,750
<i>This is for your safety.</i>

865
01:46:51,833 --> 01:46:54,166
<i>God forbid that you</i>
<i>ever need to use this.</i>

866
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:39,416
<i>God forbid,</i>
<i>if you get emotionally involved,</i>

867
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:40,958
<i>you will be in trouble.</i>

868
01:48:37,041 --> 01:48:38,416
Akbar Malik.

869
01:50:02,583 --> 01:50:05,041
Sir, your trunk call is connected.

870
01:50:07,291 --> 01:50:08,416
Did you confirm it?

871
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:13,083
Sir, a trunk call has been booked
from Begumpet bus depot for Delhi.

872
01:50:13,958 --> 01:50:15,208
It's for Chief of RAW.

873
01:50:16,541 --> 01:50:17,416
Catch this.

874
01:50:18,958 --> 01:50:20,958
As soon as the call gets over send
its transcription to Colonel Khan.

875
01:50:21,041 --> 01:50:21,875
Yes, sir.

876
01:50:30,416 --> 01:50:31,250
Akbar.

877
01:50:33,166 --> 01:50:34,708
Are you surprised to hear my voice?

878
01:50:36,666 --> 01:50:38,166
I am happy to hear your voice.

879
01:50:38,583 --> 01:50:40,291
Really? What about yesterday?

880
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:42,291
Was that your way of expressing happiness?

881
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:44,291
It wasn't my decision.

882
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:47,666
It was a call hastily
taken by somebody else.

883
01:50:48,125 --> 01:50:51,375
<i>Anyway, it's futile talking</i>
<i>about what happened yesterday.</i>

884
01:50:51,916 --> 01:50:53,875
What matters is the present...

885
01:50:54,416 --> 01:50:55,750
and the future of the country.

886
01:50:55,833 --> 01:50:56,708
What about me?

887
01:50:57,166 --> 01:50:59,791
What about the one
who was doing everything for the country?

888
01:51:09,541 --> 01:51:14,416
Akbar, a storm can hit a riverbank
settlement at any moment.

889
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:16,833
When a storm peaks...

890
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:22,416
people need to leave their work,
house and everything else behind.

891
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:24,583
<i>They have to empty the whole place.</i>

892
01:51:25,041 --> 01:51:27,333
What are you trying to say?

893
01:51:27,875 --> 01:51:31,875
You are stuck in a storm
and are useless for me.

894
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:34,041
<i>In fact, now that I look at it...</i>

895
01:51:34,583 --> 01:51:36,000
<i>you are not one of my own anymore.</i>

896
01:51:37,416 --> 01:51:40,208
You are like a Pakistani for me.

897
01:51:42,791 --> 01:51:46,333
Like a Joker in a pack of cards.

898
01:51:46,583 --> 01:51:49,125
<i>In these circumstances, you are</i>
<i>a liability for me.</i>

899
01:51:49,291 --> 01:51:50,833
<i>I have done my job.</i>

900
01:51:51,958 --> 01:51:54,000
You will have to do yours.

901
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,875
<i>When will you be back from your training?</i>

902
01:52:33,666 --> 01:52:35,166
Mom, it's difficult to say.

903
01:52:36,375 --> 01:52:37,833
It's the nature of the job.

904
01:52:38,041 --> 01:52:44,458
<i>You cover my head</i>
<i>When the sun beats down</i>

905
01:52:45,125 --> 01:52:51,541
<i>You cry with me when I am hurt</i>

906
01:52:51,875 --> 01:52:58,333
<i>If I remove my amulet</i>

907
01:52:58,750 --> 01:53:03,875
<i>You start worrying</i>

908
01:53:06,125 --> 01:53:12,625
<i>Keep away the evil eye</i>

909
01:53:13,416 --> 01:53:18,958
<i>Is what you tell me with love</i>

910
01:53:20,125 --> 01:53:23,416
<i>Oh, Mom</i>

911
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:27,250
<i>I think about you all the time</i>

912
01:53:27,416 --> 01:53:30,791
<i>Oh, Mom</i>

913
01:53:30,875 --> 01:53:34,375
<i>I think about you all the time</i>

914
01:53:34,458 --> 01:53:37,875
<i>Oh, Mom</i>

915
01:53:37,958 --> 01:53:41,625
<i>I think about you all the time</i>

916
01:55:21,458 --> 01:55:23,291
-Shraddha Sharma?
-Yes.

917
01:55:25,958 --> 01:55:27,000
Come with us.

918
01:56:03,083 --> 01:56:04,166
Ahmed Salahuddin...

919
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:08,625
was the imam of Bulandshah Masjid
and the India's network head.

920
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:12,500
Joker's death is also the
end of the Indian spy network.

921
01:56:13,291 --> 01:56:14,416
What do you think?

922
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:17,708
Just because you shared some
details we shall embrace you.

923
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:19,333
No, sir.

924
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:22,833
I just want an opportunity to
be considered one of your own.

925
01:56:23,916 --> 01:56:26,416
Just one chance to tell India that...

926
01:56:26,958 --> 01:56:29,791
the way they treated this Indian Muslim,

927
01:56:30,583 --> 01:56:34,208
they dare not do it with any other
Akbar Malik alias Romeo Ali.

928
01:56:34,291 --> 01:56:35,583
What are you trying to say?

929
01:56:37,625 --> 01:56:40,208
I want to carry out Operation Badlipur.

930
01:56:42,875 --> 01:56:44,291
Are you in your senses?

931
01:56:45,416 --> 01:56:47,875
Do you have any idea of the
significance of this operation?

932
01:56:48,333 --> 01:56:49,375
Very well.

933
01:56:51,041 --> 01:56:54,083
I am requesting you because this
is a critical operation.

934
01:56:55,166 --> 01:56:57,875
Only I have complete knowledge
of this mission.

935
01:56:59,041 --> 01:57:00,791
-And the late Isaq Afridi--
-I will give you a chance.

936
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,416
-Sir.
-Go.

937
01:57:03,958 --> 01:57:06,875
Prepare for the mission.
We don't have much time.

938
01:57:09,291 --> 01:57:10,333
Thank you, sir.

939
01:57:19,083 --> 01:57:20,875
Sir, until yesterday
he was a RAW agent.

940
01:57:20,958 --> 01:57:23,041
Which is why even after
all that he's done...

941
01:57:23,125 --> 01:57:25,625
he still has to pass this test.

942
01:57:25,791 --> 01:57:28,791
-But, it's still a big risk.
-You will be on that plane as well.

943
01:57:29,333 --> 01:57:33,500
If he misses, you will not miss
and you will complete the mission.

944
01:57:35,958 --> 01:57:36,791
Yes, sir.

945
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:50,541
Our spy network has
almost been wiped out.

946
01:57:51,541 --> 01:57:53,166
Also, the head of your spy network.

947
01:57:57,041 --> 01:57:57,958
Shraddha?

948
02:02:00,958 --> 02:02:03,208
<i>On the third of December in 1971...</i>

949
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:09,500
<i>Pakistan Air Force bombed</i>
<i>Pathankot Airbase at 05:40 p.m.</i>

950
02:02:10,375 --> 02:02:14,750
<i>Right after that,</i>
<i>ten Indian airbases were bombed.</i>

951
02:02:14,916 --> 02:02:18,250
<i>India was well-prepared</i>
<i>for these attacks...</i>

952
02:02:18,958 --> 02:02:22,291
<i>and promptly launched</i>
<i>a counter attack on Pakistan.</i>

953
02:02:22,750 --> 02:02:26,166
<i>On that very evening,</i>
<i>Prime Minister Indira Gandhi</i>

954
02:02:26,250 --> 02:02:28,750
<i>addressed the entire nation.</i>

955
02:02:28,916 --> 02:02:32,916
<i>She said that India and Pakistan</i>
<i>are at war.</i>

956
02:02:33,541 --> 02:02:38,291
<i>On December 16, 1971</i>
<i>the Pakistan Army accepted defeat.</i>

957
02:02:38,583 --> 02:02:41,416
<i>Pakistan signed the</i>
<i>instrument of surrender in Dhaka.</i>

958
02:02:41,541 --> 02:02:46,166
<i>Thus, a new country was born</i>
<i>in the Indian subcontinent.</i>

959
02:02:46,708 --> 02:02:47,833
<i>Bangladesh.</i>

960
02:03:32,166 --> 02:03:34,208
<i>Only three days left for</i>
<i>Pakistan's President General Ghazi</i>

961
02:03:34,291 --> 02:03:38,416
<i>and Foreign Minister Nawab Afridi</i>
<i>to arrive in Nepal.</i>

962
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:41,958
<i>To inspect the security arrangements...</i>

963
02:03:42,041 --> 02:03:44,958
<i>a delegation has landed</i>
<i>from Pakistan to Nepal.</i>

964
02:03:45,083 --> 02:03:49,333
<i>In other news, Prakash Padukone has won</i>
<i>Kuala Lumpur Championship...</i>

965
02:03:49,583 --> 02:03:51,416
Chief, how does following
all this benefit you?

966
02:03:52,083 --> 02:03:53,208
It's been ten years.

967
02:03:54,041 --> 02:03:55,416
You are now on the verge of retirement.

968
02:03:56,041 --> 02:03:58,625
It's not about benefits.
It's about habits.

969
02:04:00,250 --> 02:04:02,708
It's easy to retire from a position...

970
02:04:04,125 --> 02:04:07,375
but tough to retire
from your way of thinking.

971
02:04:14,083 --> 02:04:16,041
What is the hurry, gentlemen?

972
02:04:31,708 --> 02:04:32,625
Walter Khan.

973
02:04:36,958 --> 02:04:39,375
I have gotten rid of everything
that you have given me.

974
02:04:51,416 --> 02:04:53,500
You said that there would
be no security lapses.

975
02:04:55,666 --> 02:04:59,708
But, our country's special
friends are very much here.

976
02:05:00,166 --> 02:05:01,625
Sir, they are from the South Asia--

977
02:05:19,708 --> 02:05:21,333
I am indebted to you.

978
02:05:22,416 --> 02:05:23,250
Well...

979
02:05:24,416 --> 02:05:26,458
I got an opportunity to thank you today.

980
02:05:30,208 --> 02:05:32,166
For making an ordinary man
really special.

981
02:05:33,416 --> 02:05:35,208
For showing my acquaintances
how pathetic they are.

982
02:05:37,916 --> 02:05:40,416
Thank you for making me understand
the real meaning of life.

983
02:05:41,541 --> 02:05:43,250
Thankfully, you stopped there.

984
02:05:43,541 --> 02:05:45,166
Or else, I would have learnt too much.

985
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:53,875
How are your instincts faring?

986
02:06:07,666 --> 02:06:09,208
Just a few days to go
before you take charge.

987
02:06:32,708 --> 02:06:34,791
There has been no official announcement.

988
02:06:35,416 --> 02:06:37,291
And only a few people know
about this in the department.

989
02:06:37,833 --> 02:06:38,750
How does he know this?

990
02:07:05,833 --> 02:07:07,791
<i>A great magician once said that...</i>

991
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:17,708
<i>People focus on your left hand</i>

992
02:07:17,791 --> 02:07:19,416
<i>but your right hand does the trick.</i>

993
02:07:20,916 --> 02:07:22,875
<i>In the same way, my right hand...</i>

994
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:25,416
<i>was silently doing the trick.</i>

995
02:07:26,375 --> 02:07:29,250
In the next 12 hours,

996
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:33,083
heavy rains and a storm are expected.

997
02:07:34,791 --> 02:07:39,250
It is expected that the whole village
may be drowned.

998
02:07:39,458 --> 02:07:45,083
The weather department has ordered an
immediate evacuation of Badlipur.

999
02:07:48,041 --> 02:07:51,250
Leave alone drowning,
there were no chances of rain.

1000
02:07:58,375 --> 02:08:02,166
That's why you wanted to keep
everything low profile.

1001
02:08:03,208 --> 02:08:04,541
Until November 17,

1002
02:08:04,625 --> 02:08:09,625
225 square kilometer around Badlipur
was under the control of Mukti Bahini.

1003
02:08:10,250 --> 02:08:12,166
That means under our control.

1004
02:08:13,333 --> 02:08:15,750
We just shifted people from
one location to the other.

1005
02:09:02,333 --> 02:09:04,458
In a card game,
Joker is the only card...

1006
02:09:05,958 --> 02:09:09,208
with deceptive looks and actions.

1007
02:09:12,458 --> 02:09:14,791
The real story of today's meeting.

1008
02:09:27,916 --> 02:09:30,583
Until today, only Madam
and I knew this.

1009
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:32,458
Now, the next Chief of RAW
knows this as well.

1010
02:09:39,291 --> 02:09:40,375
Do you remember that incident...

1011
02:09:40,916 --> 02:09:44,208
when Akbar called me
from an unsecured landline?

1012
02:09:45,625 --> 02:09:48,083
I was trying to communicate
through my gestures.

1013
02:09:48,791 --> 02:09:53,708
Akbar, a storm can hit a riverbank
settlement at any moment.

1014
02:09:54,208 --> 02:09:56,208
When a storm peaks...

1015
02:09:56,958 --> 02:10:01,541
people need to leave their work,
house and everything else behind.

1016
02:10:01,625 --> 02:10:04,000
<i>They have to empty the whole place.</i>

1017
02:10:04,208 --> 02:10:06,708
What are you trying to say?

1018
02:10:07,125 --> 02:10:09,916
You are like a Pakistani for me.

1019
02:10:12,541 --> 02:10:15,875
Like a Joker in a pack of cards.

1020
02:10:24,041 --> 02:10:27,333
<i>If I say your tea is cold,</i>

1021
02:10:28,583 --> 02:10:32,125
<i>then I'm actually trying to tell</i>
<i>you that you don't need to drink it.</i>

1022
02:10:33,291 --> 02:10:35,458
<i>You will never be spoken to</i>
<i>in a straight forward manner.</i>

1023
02:10:36,583 --> 02:10:39,458
<i>You will have to interpret the truth...</i>

1024
02:10:40,791 --> 02:10:42,250
<i>and understand it.</i>

1025
02:10:46,041 --> 02:10:49,916
<i>You are like a Pakistani for me.</i>

1026
02:10:51,041 --> 02:10:53,791
<i>Like a Joker in a pack of cards.</i>

1027
02:10:53,875 --> 02:10:56,416
<i>A storm can hit a riverbank</i>
<i>settlement at any moment.</i>

1028
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:59,000
<i>You need to leave everything behind.</i>

1029
02:10:59,583 --> 02:11:01,875
<i>They have to empty the whole place.</i>

1030
02:11:04,041 --> 02:11:06,416
The Badlipur plan.

1031
02:11:08,125 --> 02:11:09,916
Him becoming a Pakistani.

1032
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:13,791
Taking charge of Operation Badlipur.

1033
02:11:16,583 --> 02:11:17,666
You were responsible for everything.

1034
02:11:18,250 --> 02:11:19,750
He did get my hint.

1035
02:11:20,708 --> 02:11:22,500
But he paved his own path.

1036
02:11:24,041 --> 02:11:28,958
In the war of 1971,
we received information...

1037
02:11:30,916 --> 02:11:33,125
about the attacks on
Indian air bases from...

1038
02:11:33,458 --> 02:11:37,416
In the last ten years, India has
managed to stay a step ahead of Pakistan.

1039
02:11:41,166 --> 02:11:43,083
Romeo Akbar Walter.

1040
02:11:44,125 --> 02:11:47,583
He won their trust with
the Badlipur blast...

1041
02:11:47,875 --> 02:11:49,333
and never looked back.

1042
02:11:50,791 --> 02:11:54,791
He lost his real identity and family.

1043
02:11:57,875 --> 02:12:04,000
He wasn't even able to attend
the funeral of his mother.

1044
02:12:10,375 --> 02:12:15,125
<i>Oh, Mom</i>

1045
02:12:17,958 --> 02:12:24,375
<i>Oh, Mom</i>

1046
02:12:43,208 --> 02:12:49,083
<i>Oh, Mom</i>

1047
02:14:31,625 --> 02:14:33,041
<i>There are some people</i>

1048
02:14:33,416 --> 02:14:36,916
<i>we know nothing about.</i>

1049
02:14:37,291 --> 02:14:41,375
<i>These people selflessly sacrifice</i>
<i>everything for their motherland.</i>

1050
02:14:41,708 --> 02:14:44,541
<i>Knowing that, at the end of their journey,</i>

1051
02:14:45,083 --> 02:14:48,041
<i>they will neither get fame nor respect.</i>

1052
02:14:49,083 --> 02:14:52,333
<i>Sometimes, they are not</i>
<i>even cremated or buried</i>

1053
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:54,583
<i>in their own motherland.</i>

1054
02:14:55,375 --> 02:14:59,666
