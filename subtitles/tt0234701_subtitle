1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,500
 'Lakshmi Mansion.'

2
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:02,166
 Please sit!

3
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,416
 Are you all fine?

4
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:07,541
 Yes!

5
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,166
Mr. Shastri! - Yes?

6
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,541
Did your son get a seat in medical college?

7
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,583
Sir, you forget the good deeds that you do.

8
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,500
 He got a seat. He has become MBBS.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,541
 He has started his practice even.

10
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,750
 Is that so? He became a doctor?

11
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,791
Yes, Mr. Shankar. Did your child pass his inter?

12
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,291
Yes. He is going to enroll himself for BA.

13
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,458
 Okay. - But..

14
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,833
 What? Shortage of fees?

15
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,541
 Say it openly.

16
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:40,083
Mr. Rajan, when the giver is aware of the mendicant's need..

17
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,416
..why should the mendicant say the same?

18
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:46,541
Fine. Send your child to my office tomorrow.

19
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:50,541
 I will give him a year's fees.

20
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:11,916
Greetings. - Greetings.

21
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,083
Good morning! - Good morning!

22
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:18,875
Good morning! - Good morning!

23
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,875
 Good morning!

24
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,791
Here! - Here!

25
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,166
Do you all use the matches of my factory?

26
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,000
 Yes!

27
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,333
No matchstick is better than Kabutar brand. - Yes.

28
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,541
 No flattery.

29
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,833
Sir, Kabutar (Pigeon) is considered the symbol of peace.

30
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,541
Thanks to Allah, my boss's brand name is Kabutar.

31
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:46,583
Sir, Kabutar eats less but it provides livelihood to many people.

32
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,875
 It's all your grace, sir.

33
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,791
 Kabutar is my family's grandeur.

34
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,541
At the time when my great-grandfather opened..

35
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,333
 ..Kabutar brand matches factory..

36
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,541
 ..my family was an ordinary family.

37
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,333
This brand has taken us to great heights.

38
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,875
Yes. Boss, today you didn't crack any joke.

39
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,541
Earlier you used to make your staff laugh out loud..

40
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:12,125
 ..as soon as you entered the office.

41
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,083
 I forgot.

42
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,875
 Hear a joke.

43
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,541
A man put a golden chain around an emaciated itching..

44
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,416
..dog's neck and he was strolling with it on the street.

45
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,541
 A passer-by saw this and he asked.

46
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,041
 Where are you taking this donkey?

47
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,250
 The man said, 'Can't you see?'

48
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,916
 It's not a donkey, it's a dog.

49
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,083
The passer-by replied, I wasn't asking you..

50
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,541
 ..I was asking the dog.

51
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:43,250
 Wow, sir!

52
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,125
Is it a sin for you to laugh? - Why, boss?

53
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,208
I cracked a joke, but you didn't laugh.

54
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:54,250
Boss, my father told me this joke when I was only 4 years old.

55
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,875
How can I laugh on hearing the same old joke?

56
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:02,541
I see! My joke is old! What's your name?

57
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,041
 Chandar.

58
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:08,041
See me in my room after half an hour.

59
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,500
 Hello!

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,916
 What did you say?

61
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,041
Share's price is declining. - Yes, boss.

62
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,791
 Do one thing.

63
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,333
 Buy some more shares.

64
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,875
Boss, people are selling it and you wish to buy?

65
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,541
I am putting my money at stake! Not anybody else's!

66
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,541
 Buy it!

67
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,208
 Secretary.

68
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,083
 Yes, boss.

69
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,125
 Please come and see me!

70
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:50,125
 Coming, boss!

71
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,750
 Yes, boss!

72
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,791
 Are the cheques ready?

73
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,458
 Cheques for charity?

74
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,458
 Here.

75
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,541
2000 rupees for blind people's relief association.

76
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,041
 10000 rupees for the dumb and deaf.

77
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,583
5000 rupees for Hindu Orphanage Centre.

78
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,875
And 2000 rupees for Islam Orphanage Centre.

79
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,208
 Good!

80
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:22,208
 You definitely know your job!

81
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,541
 Boss!

82
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,250
 Boss, you'd called me.

83
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,750
 No need to remind me.

84
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,208
How long have you been working here? - 6 months.

85
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,541
 I see!

86
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:46,791
Pratima.. I am making Chandar my factory's works manager.

87
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:52,750
Boss.. many senior employees are working in this factor.

88
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,541
 Won't it be injustice to them?

89
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,541
I very well know who deserves which post.

90
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,458
Good morning, boss! - Good morning!

91
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,125
 Ramchand! Bhalu!

92
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:56,583
Everybody, come here! - Coming, boss!

93
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,625
Mr. Chandar is now factory's works manager.

94
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,833
You all will have to follow his orders.

95
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,666
 Got it? - Yes, boss!

96
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:08,666
Boss, this factory is our life. And you are our boss.

97
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,541
 We will obey all your orders.

98
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,541
 Carry on!

99
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,750
Boss, I think you have given me this treat..

100
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,125
..because you have again been elected as the mayor.

101
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,916
 No, Chandar. This is not true.

102
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,875
I gave this treat.. because I like you.

103
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,291
 Thank you, boss.

104
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:37,875
Chandar, you shouldn't feel shy while eating.

105
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,500
 I am eating to my heart's content.

106
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,750
Maybe, you are not used to eating with knife and spoon.

107
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,583
 At home, I eat using hands.

108
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,875
Actually, Indian food is typically unique.

109
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:53,541
You don't relish it until you don't eat it with your hands.

110
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,833
Chandar, the food and not the hands carries the taste.

111
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:58,875
 Right, Pratima?

112
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,458
Everybody's opinion and taste is different.

113
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:02,833
 Sure!

114
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,833
 Let's sit in the hall for sometime.

115
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,583
 Come, Chandar.

116
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,750
 Chandar, do you like fruits?

117
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,125
Fruits and flowers are nature's gift.

118
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,791
But flowers are to be sniffed and fruits are to be eaten.

119
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:23,541
 Here.

120
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:24,916
 No. I've had enough of food.

121
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,541
The amount of food that boss fed me, it comprises my two meals.

122
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,875
 No, thanks.

123
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:37,291
 I will leave now. Goodbye.

124
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:38,791
 Greetings.

125
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,625
 Come Mr. Dalpatram. Sit.

126
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,416
 What's the matter, Mr. Rajan?

127
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,291
Today Lakshmi mansion is holding a feast.

128
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,000
 Would you prefer food or fruit?

129
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,541
Animals eat fruits. It's made for animals. Right, Mr. Rajan?

130
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,500
 Only animals can understand animals.

131
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,125
 Human too are a species of animal.

132
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,250
 But have only two legs.

133
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,625
Rajan, today there is a dog show in the city.

134
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,166
 Meaning, display of dogs.

135
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,750
I have bought a ticket for you as well. Let's go.

136
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,000
You too are participating? - What!

137
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,125
 I can't come. Take my dog along.

138
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,958
I will shoot you! Will I accompany a dog?

139
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,125
No, my dog will accompany you. - Daddy!

140
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,750
Mr. Rajan! You always break Chandni's heart.

141
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,541
Do consider that she comes to you with high hopes.

142
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,541
She does come. But she doesn't leave.

143
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,666
Why should I leave? This is my house!

144
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,625
 And you are my bride.

145
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:46,333
Dear, don't joke. Mr. Rajan, who is he?

146
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,666
He is Mr. Chandar. He is my factory's works manager.

147
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,875
 He is Mr. Dalpatram.

148
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,208
He is the owner of Murgi brand match factory.

149
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,958
Glad to meet you. - Likewise.

150
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,958
 Here.

151
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,791
Mr. Rajan, whenever I drink coffee, I happen to recall Shanta.

152
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,333
After Shanta's death, Lakshmi mansion..

153
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,666
 ..seems to have lost its grandeur.

154
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,708
Only a woman can make the house radiant.

155
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,041
This house will surely change someday.

156
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,291
 Some fortunate girl will surely..

157
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,166
..be the mistress of this house, Mr. Rajan.

158
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,875
 What are you trying to say?

159
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,250
 It's crystal clear.

160
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,958
Who knows? Maybe, Chandni will be the mistress of this house.

161
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:44,208
I don't need Chandni or any other girl. I prefer living in darkness.

162
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,875
You always say the same thing whenever you come.

163
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,083
 I don't like it at all!

164
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,708
 Henceforth, stop coming here!

165
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,791
 Daddy! He is totally mad!

166
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,083
Idiot! What does he thinks of himself?

167
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,208
 Look Madam.

168
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,125
When you go to a decent man's house..

169
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,166
..you should take his name respectfully.

170
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:09,583
Hey, you old man! Do you think I am Goddess?

171
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,416
 Do you think I am a stone idol?

172
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,750
I was born in an AC hospital. All cold and chilly.

173
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,250
 I studied in a convent school.

174
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,416
In college, I made all the guys dance to my tune.

175
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,666
 I am the symbol of modern youth.

176
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,666
 Come on, daddy. Let's get out.

177
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,208
 Dinu uncle.. who were they?

178
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:42,541
Chandar sir, there are a few people in the world..

179
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:47,666
..who hurt others for their selfish motives.

180
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:52,625
 And there are a few like Rajan sir.

181
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,958
Cherishing the old memories, they fall in love..

182
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,166
 ..with loneliness and sorrow.

183
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,708
They hide their tears behind their smile.

184
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,750
 Thus they revere the old bonds.

185
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,750
 Bonds.. of many lifetimes.

186
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,500
 Wake up!

187
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,625
 Wake up!

188
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,833
 Wake up!

189
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,875
 Tea.

190
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,875
 Tea.

191
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:37,000
 Its 6 30.

192
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,291
Good evening! - Come.

193
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:44,875
What is this? Leaving all the fruits you are eating this raw mango.

194
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,458
 I was feeling nauseous.

195
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:49,916
 I see!

196
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:54,041
 What!

197
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,916
 Really!

198
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,916
 Will I have to eat it?

199
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,791
 Mr. Rajan!

200
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,416
 Nurse, how is Shanta?

201
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,500
Sorry, Mr. Rajan. We could only save the child.

202
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,500
 Not the child's mother.

203
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:13,041
 Munni!

204
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,958
 Munni!

205
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,875
 Munni!

206
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,750
 Munni!

207
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,750
 Munni!

208
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,875
 Munni!

209
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,875
 Munni!

210
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,875
 Munni!

211
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:43,750
 Munni!

212
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,166
 Munni!

213
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,541
Munni! - No, sir!

214
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,541
 Munni!

215
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,708
 Munni!

216
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,541
 "The earring said to the kohl."

217
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,500
"The kohl said to the flowery string."

218
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,416
 "The earring said to the kohl."

219
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,083
"The kohl said to the flowery string."

220
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,750
"The flowery string said to the bindi."

221
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,541
 "Everyone said everything."

222
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,291
 "They revealed my secret."

223
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,125
 "The earring said to the kohl."

224
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,833
"The kohl said to the flowery string."

225
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,625
"The flowery string said to the bindi."

226
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,250
 "Everyone said everything."

227
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,083
 "They revealed my secret."

228
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,875
 "The earring said to the kohl."

229
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,875
"The kohl said to the flowery string."

230
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:48,875
 "How do I say what the kohl said?"

231
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:54,250
"How do I say what secret was revealed?"

232
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,666
 "What earring told the bindi?"

233
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:04,416
 "I want to remain quiet. But how?"

234
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:14,583
"Whenever I yawn, bells ring in my heart."

235
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:20,166
 "Bells ring in my heart."

236
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:26,166
 "Whenever I yawn."

237
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,916
 "Tinkling anklet said."

238
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,625
 "Jingling toe said."

239
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,250
 "Everyone said everything."

240
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,125
 "They revealed my secret."

241
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,833
 "The earring said to the kohl."

242
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,833
"The kohl said to the flowery string."

243
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:11,875
 "At times the mirror harasses me."

244
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:17,250
 "It explains my reflection to me."

245
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,666
 "How long will you love loneliness?"

246
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:27,166
"Let somebody enter your lonely heart."

247
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:32,500
 "O God! I don't like it alone."

248
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,291
 "Where is my beloved?"

249
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:42,875
 "Where is my beloved?"

250
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:48,750
 "O God! I don't like it alone."

251
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,708
 "The love of the heart got nervous."

252
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,000
 "The eyes felt shy."

253
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,750
 "Everyone said everything."

254
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,416
 "They revealed my secret."

255
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,125
 "The earring said to the kohl."

256
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,708
"The kohl said to the flowery string."

257
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,333
"The flowery string said to the bindi."

258
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,958
 "Everyone said everything."

259
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:13,958
 "They revealed my secret."

260
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,541
 Good morning!

261
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,833
 Boss, you? Today you didn't honk.

262
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,875
I did honk. Have a look at your watch.

263
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,750
 Today I am 5 minutes late.

264
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,750
You will have to pay penalty for 5 minutes.

265
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,666
Where did you buy this painting from?

266
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:43,541
I didn't buy it. I myself painted it, boss.

267
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,958
 I am fed up of this word 'Boss'.

268
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:51,333
This word suits in office but not at home.

269
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,958
 It resembles me.

270
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,458
 I started with some other intention.

271
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,166
 But I don't know.

272
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,166
 You are a foolish girl.

273
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,291
That's why you made me your secretary.

274
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,333
Don't waste time. My each minute is worth a thousand rupees.

275
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:11,000
Time is yours. But the money you earn belongs to the world.

276
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,666
 Don't flatter me.

277
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,666
Let's go. We are getting late. - Come.

278
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,041
 Members!

279
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,958
There is a world conference of all the match factories in Paris.

280
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,250
 I too have received an invitation.

281
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,250
I am thinking of sending such a man who proves..

282
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,875
..to be a responsible representative of our match factory.

283
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,083
That's why I have called for this meeting.

284
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,208
Pundit, will you be able to handle this responsibility?

285
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,500
 Why not, if you say so?

286
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,833
It's not that, Pundit. You are aware of your capability.

287
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,041
But the lifestyle of foreign countries..

288
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,916
..gelling with others, way of dressing and talking to others..

289
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,833
 ..all these issues are important.

290
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,000
 If you think I am an orthodox man..

291
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,875
 ..then you can send somebody else.

292
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:09,208
 Mr. Rama Shankar is junior to me.

293
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,750
Mr. Rama Shankar, I know.. in fact everybody knows..

294
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,708
 ..you are a loyal employee.

295
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,916
 You do your work diligently.

296
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:23,708
But I think we should send a young man for this task.

297
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:27,750
 This is the world of flaunting.

298
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:34,666
 What do you all think about Chandar?

299
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:38,583
 Boss, your opinion is good.

300
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,208
Nobody can be better than Chandar for this task.

301
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:46,500
Yes, boss. Chandar is the most handsome amongst us.

302
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,416
He is young. He even has good communication skills.

303
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,666
 Boss, you always spot the gem.

304
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,500
 Thank you very much!

305
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,541
You know that I don't take any step without your advice.

306
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:03,541
Now you all may leave. Except Chandar.

307
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:17,166
Chandar, I am giving you this opportunity..

308
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,208
..after depriving many people from it.

309
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:25,166
I am certain, you will spread our factory's fame in foreign countries.

310
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:26,208
 Good luck!

311
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:29,166
 Boss, I am indebted to you.

312
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,541
 But I have some helplessness..

313
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,791
..because of which I can't go out of town.

314
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:38,416
Don't talk rubbish! You don't get such an opportunity very often!

315
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:45,583
I understand, boss. I regret to refuse it.

316
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:54,666
 Chandar, nobody has ever refused me.

317
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:58,291
 That might be true.

318
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:01,541
 But I have to.

319
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:05,833
 Don't misunderstand me, boss.

320
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:09,708
 I see. I can't understand anything.

321
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,166
I can't see! I don't know what is right and what is wrong!

322
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:14,208
 Isn't this what you mean?

323
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:16,416
No, boss. This is not what I.. - You can go!

324
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:20,416
 No need to say anything else!

325
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,041
 Munni.

326
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,958
My name is not Munni. I am Rani.

327
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,666
 Fine. Rani.

328
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:07,875
Children shouldn't play at such dangerous places.

329
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:11,541
 Come.

330
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,250
Wait, mister! Shall I ask you something? - Yes.

331
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,000
If children shouldn't play at such dangerous places..

332
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,583
 ..where should they play?

333
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:22,541
 You are a talkative child.

334
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:28,250
What to do? God has given me such a big tongue.

335
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,041
 You are talkative and lovable too.

336
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:35,875
What's my fault in this? God has made me lovable.

337
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,583
 Yes. That's true.

338
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:41,083
Have you come with your nanny or alone?

339
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:45,333
Mister, children never venture out alone.

340
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:47,791
 Is that so?

341
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,000
 I don't have any nanny.

342
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,958
I have my papa. He comes with me everyday.

343
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,333
 Where is your mummy?

344
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:00,333
 Papa says she is in heaven.

345
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:03,916
 Oh! Where is your papa?

346
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,916
 He's sitting there.

347
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:18,208
 I see!

348
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:20,291
Dear, had your breakfast? - Yes.

349
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:21,750
 Did you eat the entire egg?

350
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:26,166
I didn't eat all of it, papa. I ate the egg white and the yolk.

351
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,458
 Not the covering.

352
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:29,333
 Talkative!

353
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:33,541
Papa, yesterday when I was playing, I met an uncle.

354
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:36,583
He too said I am talkative. - Is that so?

355
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,958
Chandar! - You?

356
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,291
 You and at my house?

357
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:42,041
 Papa, he is that uncle!

358
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:45,583
 Come here!

359
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,875
 Chandar, you are very decent.

360
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:52,041
But in today's world, decency is not appreciated.

361
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:53,541
You should have clearly told me that..

362
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,666
 ..you had to look after your child.

363
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:56,875
 Unnecessarily, you made me feel..

364
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,416
 ..remorseful and embarrassed.

365
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:04,125
Dear, I am sending your papa to Paris by plane.

366
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,458
 Uncle, where is Paris?

367
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:11,416
It's far away across the ocean. Fair people live there.

368
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,208
When your papa will return from Paris..

369
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,458
..he will bring loads of toys for you.

370
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:19,250
Is that so, uncle? So send my papa to Paris.

371
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,625
 When your papa will go to Paris..

372
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,250
 ..with whom will you stay?

373
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,875
I am such a fool! I didn't think of that.

374
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,416
 Who are you?

375
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,708
Dear, he is the owner of the factory where I work.

376
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:34,666
 I will stay at his house.

377
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:40,000
I will play with his children and with aunt.

378
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,458
Dear, children and aunt are not there.

379
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,791
 I will play with you. Fine?

380
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,875
Chandar, I hope you won't refuse now.

381
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,166
There is no need to. I will go.

382
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:53,166
 Papa, you will travel in plane.

383
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:02,791
 The plane has started.

384
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:07,875
 Here it goes!

385
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,958
Did you see? Isn't it good? - No!

386
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:16,125
 No! Fine, leave it. Watch this.

387
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:20,208
 Motor car!

388
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:24,500
 There it sped away!

389
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,333
Rajju.. I think she doesn't like all these toys.

390
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:37,208
She doesn't like toys. What else do I give her?

391
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:41,458
What a beautiful ring! Will you play with this?

392
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:45,458
 Here.

393
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:53,041
 Rajju, why did you remove this ring?

394
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,333
This is the symbol of Lakshmi mansion's prosperity.

395
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:03,750
Senior sir never removed this ring from his finger, Rajju.

396
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,875
 Come on. Get up.

397
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:10,875
You don't like toys. I don't understand how to please you.

398
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,625
Okay.. - No!

399
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:32,875
 Uncle! I want this doll!

400
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:36,750
 Munni!

401
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,208
 Dinu uncle!

402
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:40,875
 What's the matter, Rajju?

403
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:49,250
Uncle, she liked the doll which Munni did.

404
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,250
Uncle, I feel as if Munni has returned.

405
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,208
 Munni!

406
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:04,625
Uncle, my name is not Munni. I am Rani.

407
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,875
What's the harm if I call you Munni?

408
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:12,208
Let me call you Munni. I will buy whatever you want.

409
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:16,625
Okay, uncle. If it makes you happy then call me Munni.

410
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,625
 You are a nice girl.

411
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:23,125
Dinu uncle, remind me today while going to the office.

412
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,208
I will place an order for a musical doll for Munni from Japan.

413
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:27,875
 What is that, uncle?

414
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,500
Dear, it's a beautiful doll. - I see.

415
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,208
It can even sing. - Is that so?

416
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,208
 Yes. Dear, it will take many days..

417
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:39,666
 ..for the doll to arrive from Japan.

418
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,750
 I will sing.

419
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,583
 I will tickle.

420
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,166
 I will sing.

421
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:46,958
 I will tickle.

422
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,125
 You!

423
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,875
Chandni! - Yes, daddy.

424
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,000
 What's going on?

425
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,250
I am making the servant scratch my back, daddy.

426
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,458
Oh no! Have I kept the servant to cook or to scratch your back?

427
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:01,583
Look, dear. - Yes.

428
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:03,875
Young girls don't make the servant do such things.

429
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,500
Yes, daddy! - Daddy!

430
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,833
When your back will itch then you will know how it feels!

431
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:11,416
 Harder!

432
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:14,833
 Daddy, it's itching a lot.

433
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,291
 My luck is bad!

434
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,791
 God gave me this crazy child!

435
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:20,875
 Crazy!

436
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:25,208
Sit down! - Sit!

437
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:26,125
 Hello!

438
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:29,708
 Hello! Is it Rajan speaking?

439
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,416
Yes, speaking. Who is this?

440
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:38,750
You don't recognize my voice? Chandni speaking.

441
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,750
 Your moonlight!

442
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,625
Moonlight is not needed during daytime!

443
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,541
 I will shoot you!

444
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:49,125
How dare this guy slam the phone down!

445
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:55,333
If I ever meet him alone, I will bash him black and blue!

446
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,833
He slammed the phone down and you kicked me!

447
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:02,125
 Come on, my elephant! O my friend!

448
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,500
 Not here, that way!

449
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,875
Munni! You are back from school so early. - Yes!

450
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,666
 What did you learn in school today?

451
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,458
 Uncle, poetry.

452
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:16,541
 Is that so? Which poem?

453
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:20,625
'Twinkle-twinkle little star. How I wonder what you are!'

454
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:24,125
Wow! Saw that, uncle? Munni is very intelligent.

455
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:27,583
Dear, tomorrow when you will go to school..

456
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:31,958
Uncle, you are naive. - Why?

457
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:34,875
Tomorrow is a holiday. - Why?

458
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:36,208
 Christmas holiday!

459
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:40,000
Tomorrow is Christmas? - Yes!

460
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,000
 Wait.

461
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,083
 Hello. Rajan here.

462
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:55,916
 Yes, boss.

463
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:59,333
Today, under work pressure, I forgot that tomorrow is Christmas.

464
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:02,625
I want to send toys and sweets for the convent children.

465
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,791
 I have made the arrangement.

466
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:10,875
 You have done it. Good! Okay!

467
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:13,666
 Good she reminded me.

468
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,208
 Every year on Christmas I have to..

469
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:17,208
 ..arrange for a Santa Claus.

470
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:20,958
 Uncle, what is Santa Claus?

471
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:25,875
 Dear, Santa Claus is a kind old man.

472
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:31,458
 Fat and stout. He loves children.

473
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,041
 And every year on Christmas Eve..

474
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,666
..he descends from the sky to meet them.

475
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:40,291
Uncle, how does that old man descend from the sky?

476
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,166
 Doesn't he fall down?

477
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:46,166
 No, dear. He has a sledge.

478
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:49,166
 In that sledge, he comes down.

479
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:53,916
He gives children whatever they want.

480
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:56,875
Uncle, will Santa Claus come to our house?

481
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,625
Yes. Why not? - When?

482
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:02,083
 On Christmas Eve. At 12 o'clock.

483
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:06,500
Will Santa Claus give me whatever I ask?

484
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,500
 Yes, surely. Why not?

485
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:16,083
 "Santa Claus comes."

486
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:20,541
"Riding on a reindeer sledge and singing a song."

487
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:25,041
 "Santa Claus comes."

488
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:30,000
"Riding on a reindeer sledge and singing a song."

489
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,541
 "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"

490
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:38,875
 "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"

491
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:43,500
 "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"

492
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,500
 "Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"

493
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:18,333
"I have brought toys from all over the world."

494
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:22,708
"I have brought toys from all over the world."

495
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:27,041
 "Blue, yellow and beautiful toys."

496
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:31,541
 "A fat bride and a rubber doll."

497
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,875
 "Old man and old woman."

498
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:38,083
 "The monkey is dancing."

499
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,416
 "The monkey is dancing."

500
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:42,541
 "The bear is playing the lyre."

501
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:46,958
 "Santa Claus comes."

502
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:51,500
"Riding on a reindeer sledge and singing a song."

503
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,500
 "Santa Claus comes."

504
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:21,875
"When children will wake up in the morning."

505
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:26,208
"When children will wake up in the morning."

506
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:34,833
"Picking up toys from beneath the pillow, they will run."

507
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:39,166
"Opening their packet they will dance and tell everybody."

508
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:39,791
 "What?"

509
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:44,125
"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"

510
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:48,458
"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"

511
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:52,791
"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"

512
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:56,541
"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!"

513
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:00,875
 "Santa Claus is leaving."

514
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:05,208
 "He will come back next year."

515
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:09,583
 "Santa Claus is leaving."

516
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:13,583
 "He will come back next year."

517
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:53,250
 Santa Claus! You have come!

518
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,208
 I saw you in my dream.

519
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:58,958
 Wait! I will call my uncle! Uncle!

520
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:06,541
No, dear. I meet only children. Elders can't see me.

521
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:10,625
Fine. Santa Claus, where is your sledge?

522
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:14,875
 I have left it with moon.

523
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,625
Santa Claus, what all things have you brought for me?

524
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:21,083
 I have brought many things!

525
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:26,583
 Look, toys, Christmas cake..

526
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,416
 ..bubble gum and toffee.

527
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:33,541
Uncle too brings all these things for me everyday.

528
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:37,583
 Dear child, what do you want?

529
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,458
 Will you give me whatever I ask for?

530
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:41,500
 Why not?

531
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,250
Really? Promise! - Promise!

532
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:51,208
Shall I tell you? - Yes.

533
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:55,208
 I want a mummy.

534
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:57,291
 You want a mummy?

535
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,708
 Yes. I am just asking for a mummy.

536
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:01,791
 Mummy!

537
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:05,625
What are you thinking? You have promised me.

538
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,208
 Uncle too told me that Santa Claus..

539
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,416
 ..will give me whatever I ask for.

540
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:14,500
Bring my mummy! - Dear..

541
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,958
Papa too used to say that my mummy has gone on the moon.

542
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:24,541
Go to the moon. Bring my mummy in your sledge.

543
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,625
 Look, dear.

544
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:30,875
At the moment, your mummy is sleeping on the moon.

545
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,333
 It's not good to wake her up.

546
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:36,791
In the morning, I will wake up your mummy..

547
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:38,958
 ..and bring her in my sledge.

548
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,208
 Fine. Do bring her.

549
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,750
If you didn't bring my mummy in the morning..

550
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,875
..then I will say that you are a bad old man!

551
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:50,000
 No, dear.

552
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
When you will wake up in the morning..

553
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,250
 ..your mummy will be in your room.

554
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,250
 Now go to sleep.

555
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:05,958
 Goodnight!

556
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:09,958
 Goodnight!

557
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,625
 Mummy!

558
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,541
 Mummy, you have come!

559
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,708
Mummy, you have come back from the moon!

560
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:33,333
 Look, this is our house.

561
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,791
Was there a better house than this on the moon..

562
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:38,250
..that you were not willing to come back?

563
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,041
Come, mummy. I will introduce you to my uncle.

564
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:46,916
 Uncle!

565
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:48,000
 What's the matter, Munni?

566
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,875
 Uncle, look! Here is my mummy!

567
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,125
 Is that so?

568
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:55,125
 My mummy is so pretty.

569
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:58,708
Yes, Munni. I too liked your mummy. - More than me?

570
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,291
 No! How is that possible?

571
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,916
Munni, tell Dinu uncle to make a nice cup of tea for your mummy.

572
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,916
 I will myself get it.

573
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,875
 I did what you said.

574
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:18,791
 But being a kid's mother..

575
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,625
 It's just for a few days.

576
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,666
When Chandar will return from Paris..

577
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,958
..her attention will be diverted on her father.

578
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:27,500
Till then, who will look after the office?

579
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,708
Don't worry about the office. I will look after it.

580
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,875
 Inflation is on the rise.

581
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:34,083
It's difficult to make both the ends meet.

582
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:35,875
 We want three months bonus.

583
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,750
 Yes! We want three months bonus!

584
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:38,916
 Yes!

585
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,541
 You won't get it!

586
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,208
Next month onwards, I will stop your salary even!

587
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:44,708
 I will sack all of you!

588
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:45,916
Dalpatram! - Down with him!

589
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,125
Dalpatram! - Down with him!

590
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,916
Dalpatram! - Down with him!

591
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:50,291
Dalpatram! - Down with him!

592
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:52,875
Dalpatram! - Down with him!

593
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:54,500
Dalpatram! - Down with him!

594
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,791
Daddy, what slogan are they shouting?

595
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:00,875
 Shall I join? Dalpatram!

596
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,875
 Hey!

597
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,291
 Dalpatram is your father!

598
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:06,083
 Dalpatram! Down with him!

599
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:07,291
 Dalpatram! Down with him!

600
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:09,958
She is mad and she will make me go crazy!

601
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:11,666
 Dalpatram! Down with him!

602
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,333
 Dalpatram! Down with him!

603
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,958
There are slogans outside and inside too.

604
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:18,083
I think I have come to some graveyard.

605
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,416
I will shoot! - Me or the workers?

606
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:23,541
You, Tolaram! - Then I am gone!

607
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:24,541
 Keep it inside!

608
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:25,791
Tolaram! - Yes!

609
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:29,416
 You can never reform.

610
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:30,625
My father! - Yes!

611
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,541
 He is a miser, a frugal man!

612
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:37,416
I will go and announce 5 years bonus! - Wow!

613
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:38,625
Then! - Then!

614
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:42,666
Then I will teach Kabutar factory's owner Rajan a lesson.

615
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:47,708
Pratima, did you deposit Kolkata party's cheque?

616
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:49,333
 Pratima!

617
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:52,083
 Oh God!

618
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:53,458
 What has happened to me?

619
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,416
Did I have a drink early in the morning?

620
00:44:56,916 --> 00:45:00,416
I myself told her to stay at home.

621
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:10,666
 Hello!

622
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,125
Pratima! Rajan here! What's going on?

623
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:15,708
 I am playing with Rani.

624
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,916
 She doesn't like it without me.

625
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:20,416
Are you facing any problem in the office?

626
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:25,458
No. Office work is important and you are needed at home too.

627
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:27,833
Mummy! Whose call is it? - It's boss.

628
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:31,166
Boss! What's that, mummy? - Boss is like God.

629
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:34,625
Is that so? Give me the phone. I will talk to God.

630
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:40,000
Hello, God! Greetings! This is Rani from earth!

631
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,791
 My mummy has returned to me.

632
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:45,541
 Don't call her back on moon.

633
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:47,791
Dear, what will you do if I call your mummy back?

634
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:49,083
 Shall I tell you?

635
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:57,000
I won't drink milk. I won't sleep. And I will cry a lot!

636
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,791
No, dear! Don't cry! Fine. I won't call your mummy.

637
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,875
 I will let her stay with you. Fine?

638
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:11,083
God, you are so nice. I will give you a kiss.

639
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:15,666
 It was a sweet kiss. Thank you!

640
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:19,791
 Mummy, God even talks in English.

641
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:24,625
 Mummy, you too give a kiss to God.

642
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:27,708
God only takes kiss from children. Not from elders.

643
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:31,708
 Is that so?

644
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:24,416
"If there hadn't been children in this big world."

645
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:31,875
"If there hadn't been children in this big world."

646
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:35,208
 "There would have been only deceit."

647
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:39,416
"If these children hadn't been there."

648
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:46,875
"If there hadn't been children in this big world."

649
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:50,208
 "There would have been only deceit."

650
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:54,416
"If these children hadn't been there."

651
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:58,416
 "In this big world."

652
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:16,708
 "Nobody would have loved anybody."

653
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:20,708
"Motherhood would have been forlorn."

654
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:23,958
 "Nobody would have loved anybody."

655
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:28,208
"Motherhood would have been forlorn."

656
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:35,541
"Youth wouldn't have adorned the streets."

657
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,458
 "There wouldn't have been gardens."

658
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,333
 "There wouldn't have been spring."

659
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,250
"If these children hadn't been there."

660
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,250
 "In this big world."

661
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,541
 "When they smile, hearts blossom."

662
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:16,291
 "When they cry, hearts break."

663
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:23,541
"When they give you a loving smile, you receive all the joy."

664
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,500
 "If this smile hadn't been there..

665
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,416
..there wouldn't have been any life."

666
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:31,291
"If these children hadn't been there."

667
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:35,291
 "In this big world."

668
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:15,666
 "The way water hides in the clouds."

669
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:19,416
 "Life hides in their charm."

670
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:23,041
 "The way water hides in the clouds."

671
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:26,958
 "Life hides in their charm."

672
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:30,541
 "They sway on the ground."

673
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:34,208
"The way butterfly flies in the air."

674
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:38,208
"These children are the melody of flute."

675
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:42,083
"If these children hadn't been there."

676
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:49,625
"If there hadn't been children in this big world."

677
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:52,875
 "There would have been only deceit."

678
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:57,041
"If these children hadn't been there."

679
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:01,041
 "In this big world."

680
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,666
 Rajju, did you like the food today?

681
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:35,208
Dinu uncle. - Yes.

682
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:38,291
I had such delicious food after a big gap.

683
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:40,291
 Everyday you cook food like this.

684
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:45,541
 Rajju, Pratima cooked today's food.

685
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:46,541
 Is that so?

686
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,208
 Pratima cooks such delicious food.

687
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:50,708
 Good people do every task well.

688
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:55,083
They talk sweetly. And they have good thoughts.

689
00:51:55,583 --> 00:52:01,666
Rajju, now I have grown old. I am lying on my death bed.

690
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:06,000
 Who will cook food for you after me?

691
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,000
 Uncle, don't worry about the future.

692
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:25,125
 Chandar is returning. Munni!

693
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:26,791
Oh no! By now, his plane must have landed.

694
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:28,208
 What happened, uncle?

695
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:30,583
Munni, your papa is returning. - Papa is returning?

696
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:31,291
 Yes!

697
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:34,208
When he'll come and see that my mummy too has returned..

698
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:37,833
 ..he will be delighted.

699
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:38,791
 Good morning!

700
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:40,958
 He has come!

701
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:42,458
 Hi, Chandar! How was the trip?

702
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:43,625
 It was excellent!

703
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:45,291
 What did you do to your moustache?

704
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,541
This is the current trend. - Okay.

705
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:51,500
Papa! - My child!

706
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,500
 How are you, dear?

707
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,500
 Were you sad in my absence?

708
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
For a day, I was sad. Then uncle loved me a lot.

709
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:00,625
 Is it?

710
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:04,208
 Yes. He brought me a mummy too.

711
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:09,500
 Mummy, you too come here!

712
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,500
 Papa, talk to mummy.

713
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
How are you? - Fine.

714
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,916
Papa, you are folding your hands as if she is your mummy.

715
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:19,875
 She is my mummy.

716
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:22,833
Dear, every woman is somebody's mother.

717
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:26,500
He wrote me everything about you in the letter.

718
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,875
You have loved my child more than a mother.

719
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,208
 Just thanking wouldn't suffice.

720
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:37,041
Still I'd say it. Thanks. Thanks a ton.

721
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:38,250
 Come on, dear. Let's go home.

722
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,500
 Papa, this too is our house.

723
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,750
 Dear, this is your uncle's house.

724
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,416
Now that I have returned, let's go home.

725
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:48,583
Uncle, papa has returned from aboard. Today I will go with him.

726
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:50,958
 Tomorrow I will come back.

727
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:53,416
 Surely, dear.

728
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:57,875
Chandar, Munni has become an integral part of my life.

729
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,250
I will come to your house everyday to meet her.

730
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:04,041
 Come, mummy!

731
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,250
Where, Rani? - Home.

732
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:09,125
 Rani, she can't come with us.

733
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:13,208
 Why? She is my mummy!

734
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,500
 Dear, how do I explain to you? Come!

735
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,666
 No! I will take mummy along!

736
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:19,541
Rani, don't be stubborn. Come with me.

737
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:24,000
I told you! I will take mummy with me!

738
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,083
 Are you coming!

739
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,625
 Mummy! Papa is scolding me!

740
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:30,458
You are harping about mummy! I will slap you!

741
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:34,416
 No, dear! Don't cry!

742
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:35,875
 Look, Chandar.

743
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:38,541
 Children are like flowers.

744
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:42,541
The way flowers wither when the wind is gusty..

745
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:45,833
..similarly children too wither when you scold them.

746
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:48,083
 After all, she is a small girl.

747
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,500
 Go, Pratima.

748
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,291
 Me?

749
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:55,416
Yes. You know that I can't see tears in Munni's eyes.

750
00:54:55,916 --> 00:54:57,416
 My happiness lies in that of hers.

751
00:54:57,916 --> 00:55:00,416
 Munni, take your mummy.

752
00:55:00,916 --> 00:55:02,500
I will drop them home and then return to office. - Okay.

753
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,208
 Come, mummy! Bye, uncle! Bye!

754
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:10,125
 Bye!

755
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:14,125
 Bye!

756
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:20,666
 Come.

757
00:55:21,166 --> 00:55:22,541
 This is my small house.

758
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:26,083
So what? The person who lives in the house should be bighearted.

759
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:28,291
 Thanks.

760
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:32,458
I am going to the factory to report the trip to boss.

761
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:35,208
Till then stay with Rani. - Yes. Surely.

762
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,208
 Thanks.

763
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:41,500
 Come, mummy!

764
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,750
I am suggesting these changes keeping in mind..

765
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,625
..whatever I saw in the outside world.

766
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:49,333
People are no longer interested in old things.

767
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,250
 Everybody wants new design.

768
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,791
No matter what business it is, customer satisfaction comes first.

769
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:58,208
Outside firms make new designs and new brands everyday.

770
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:02,333
Chandar, there might be many changes in matchbox business.

771
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,833
 Our Kabutar brand will never change.

772
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:09,416
The label will remain the same. Matches will remain the same.

773
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:11,500
Boss, being rigid in business matters..

774
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,333
 ..is like being your own enemy.

775
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:18,791
Chandar, I had sent you as my company's representative.

776
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:21,208
I never thought that you would come back..

777
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:23,625
 ..and change my family brand.

778
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:26,041
 I follow certain principles in life.

779
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:30,166
And I am not ready to forsake my principles at any cost.

780
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:34,166
I know the value of Kabutar brand matches.

781
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:41,791
Mummy! - Yes.

782
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:45,125
I have changed my clothes. Why didn't you?

783
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:47,791
 Because my saris are at home.

784
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:52,666
Mummy, you forgot? There are many saris in my house.

785
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:55,791
Whose? - Yours. Who else?

786
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:59,791
 Mummy, come. I will show you.

787
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:06,625
 Papa says all these are your saris.

788
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:10,625
 Here!

789
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:14,125
This is a nice sari. Wear this, mummy.

790
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:17,000
Don't be stubborn, Rani. I will wear it later.

791
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,666
Will you wear the sari or shall I cry?

792
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:24,208
'You know that I can't see tears in Munni's eyes.'

793
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,875
 'My happiness lies in that of hers.'

794
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:28,541
Mummy! - Yes.

795
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:30,166
 What are you thinking?

796
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:34,166
Nothing. Give. I will wear it. - My nice mummy!

797
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:49,541
Sorry. Rani was insisting that I wear this sari.

798
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:53,291
You did the right thing. You didn't break my child's heart.

799
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:56,541
I don't have anybody in this world besides Rani.

800
00:57:57,041 --> 00:58:00,541
Its evening. You didn't switch on the lights.

801
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:06,666
 Now permit me to go home.

802
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:11,166
Come, I will drop you. - No. I will manage.

803
00:58:11,666 --> 00:58:16,125
 Bye, Rani. We will meet tomorrow.

804
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:20,708
Mummy, you want to leave me and go back on the moon!

805
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:23,583
 I won't let you go!

806
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,583
Don't be stubborn, Rani. I will come tomorrow.

807
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:27,625
When you are going to come tomorrow..

808
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,958
 ..then why are you leaving?

809
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:31,583
 Listen to me, Rani.

810
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:36,500
God will get upset if I stayed here at night. - So what?

811
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,708
 Dear, don't be stubborn. Let her go.

812
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,166
Why? - Rani, I will slap you.

813
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:45,291
 Papa, I will cry before you slap me.

814
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:46,166
 No, Rani.

815
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:50,041
 Let her cry! You leave!

816
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:54,250
 Mummy, don't leave me!

817
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,875
 Rani! Don't cry!

818
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:03,291
 Listen to me! You too come with me!

819
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:05,125
 Papa, shall I go?

820
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,875
 Rani! I will slap you!

821
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:09,541
 You shouldn't beat children.

822
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:14,250
Boss will get angry if he found out that you slapped her.

823
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:19,958
Rani, I won't go. I will stay here. Fine?

824
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:23,958
 Now smile. Smile.

825
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:46,625
Mummy! - Yes.

826
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,500
Where is papa? - He is sleeping in the hall.

827
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,541
 Take me to papa.

828
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:57,666
No, dear. He is tired. He needs rest.

829
00:59:58,166 --> 01:00:03,666
Mummy, we too will go and sleep there. Come, mummy.

830
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:07,666
 Come!

831
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:15,750
 What's the matter, Pratima?

832
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,541
 Rani wants to sleep with you.

833
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:22,541
 Come, dear. Come to me.

834
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:30,625
 Mummy, you too sleep here.

835
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:35,958
Dear, you sleep here with mummy. I will go and sleep inside.

836
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:38,291
 No, papa. You too sleep here.

837
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:40,083
Dear, there is not enough space here.

838
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,166
So come inside. There is enough space here.

839
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:47,166
 Come, papa. Come, mummy.

840
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:56,833
You both sleep on the bed. I will sleep on the floor.

841
01:00:57,333 --> 01:01:00,833
 Come, dear.

842
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:33,541
 Mummy!

843
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:34,916
 What happened, Rani?

844
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:36,875
 Come to me.

845
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:38,458
 I am with you.

846
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:40,500
 Mummy, here.

847
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,208
Rani! Go to sleep quietly! There is no space for her to sleep!

848
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:45,958
 There is enough space here!

849
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:47,166
 Will you sleep?

850
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:50,166
Nowadays you have become very stubborn!

851
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:53,166
 Mummy!

852
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:56,541
 Mummy!

853
01:01:57,041 --> 01:02:01,000
 Don't make the child cry.

854
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:06,791
I have come here to fulfill all her desires.

855
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:10,000
 Again you have become lonely.

856
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,041
 Try to recall, dear.

857
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:15,791
Once upon a time, this was a flourishing house.

858
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:21,208
 One by one, everybody went away.

859
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:30,125
Senior sir died. Shanta died. Munni too.

860
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:36,541
Rajju, without any family member, a house is not a house.

861
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:39,125
 This is the norm of the world.

862
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:44,541
Listen to me. Forget the old memories.

863
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:52,083
I know you will say there can't be another girl like Shanta.

864
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:56,458
I will say it's not true. There is one.

865
01:02:56,958 --> 01:03:00,875
 Pratima is just like Shanta.

866
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,875
Since a long time I have been observing..

867
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:08,333
..you dwell in a corner of her heart.

868
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:11,083
 While she was here for a few days..

869
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:14,333
 ..this house felt like home.

870
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:22,166
Since the time she has left, this house has again become forlorn.

871
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:27,291
 Rajju, I consider you as my child.

872
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:29,750
 You are my master.

873
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,750
 Consider this as an elder's request.

874
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:35,958
 Restore the lost joy of this house.

875
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:38,166
Since a long time I have been explaining to you..

876
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:42,541
..that you can't spend your life just with memories.

877
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:46,541
 You can't, Rajju. You can't.

878
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:49,000
 Do one thing.

879
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:54,041
Today, before going to sleep, peep into your heart once.

880
01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:58,041
Maybe, you will hear Pratima's voice in some corner of your heart.

881
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:33,541
'Pratima, I don't know why there is a new joy in my heart.'

882
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:35,208
'Its difficult for me to decide whether..

883
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:39,000
..I have brought this joy or it's somebody else.'

884
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,666
'I don't know where my joy will take me to.'

885
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:46,833
'Pratima, till date, you have been by my side willingly.'

886
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:50,333
 'Will you become mine forever?'

887
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:53,666
'Don't consider this letter as your boss's order.'

888
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:56,583
'Your consent will fill my life with joy.'

889
01:04:57,083 --> 01:05:00,333
'Your refusal will elevate your esteem in my eyes.'

890
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:04,333
 'Rajan.'

891
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,500
 Dinu uncle.

892
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:25,333
Deliver this letter to Pratima in the morning.

893
01:05:25,833 --> 01:05:29,333
Pratima? - Yes.

894
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:34,833
Earlier, our business's graph was on the rise.

895
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:36,041
 And now it's declining.

896
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:38,458
If our matches' sale continued to decline..

897
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:41,625
 ..then what about our factory?

898
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:43,791
Boss, when your ancestors started this factory..

899
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:45,625
..at that time, there wasn't any competition.

900
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,083
 This is a competitive age!

901
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:49,583
People see new things and they forget the old.

902
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:51,875
 New is better than old goods.

903
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:53,208
 What else do you want to say?

904
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:55,750
I just want to request you that if you didn't accept..

905
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:59,041
..the plan which I have submitted regarding the factory..

906
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:03,041
..then people will even start hating the face of Kabutar.

907
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:17,250
Boss.. you didn't throw my plans in the dustbin.

908
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,958
 But you have slapped me.

909
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:24,208
There can't be a better way to humiliate somebody.

910
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:27,000
Chandar, I think you have forgotten..

911
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,833
..that Lakshmi mansion's Kabutar brand match factory..

912
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:32,833
 ..was started in 1870.

913
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:35,666
Every person is aware of Lakshmi mansion.

914
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:39,541
Every person knows Kabutar brand matches.

915
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:42,333
 Bear in mind.

916
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:46,666
This matchbox will remain the way it is.

917
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:50,791
 Kabutar label on it too will remain.

918
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:53,541
There were 60 matchsticks in this box.

919
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:56,416
And it will remain so in the future too.

920
01:06:56,916 --> 01:07:00,666
I again request you to leave this. Times are changing.

921
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:03,166
 Time can change. World can change.

922
01:07:03,666 --> 01:07:04,833
 Lakshmi mansion will not change.

923
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:06,916
The principles of that house will never change.

924
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:10,625
If my opinions are useless, if my opinions are not important..

925
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:13,541
..then why do you want to keep me as your employee?

926
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:14,291
 Chandar!

927
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:18,333
I don't want to be labeled as a disloyal employee..

928
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:23,000
 ..of a bankrupt factory.

929
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:28,416
If you can't change, then accept my resignation letter.

930
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:30,791
You gave me such an esteemed position.

931
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:32,875
 You sent me to Paris.

932
01:07:33,375 --> 01:07:35,916
I will forever remain indebted to you.

933
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:40,958
 I see. So you want to resign.

934
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:45,791
Think once more. Jobs are not easily available these days.

935
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:47,916
 I know, boss.

936
01:07:48,416 --> 01:07:50,666
I will open my own matchbox factory..

937
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:53,208
 ..in this city on a small scale.

938
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:56,333
It doesn't mean that I want to compete with you.

939
01:07:56,833 --> 01:08:01,708
I want to test whether the training which I received from you..

940
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:05,875
 ..was of any use.

941
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:10,250
Surely! You can open your own factory!

942
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:17,166
 But I will inaugurate it.

943
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:21,166
 Good luck!

944
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:27,541
Boss! - What happened?

945
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:28,541
 A guy had come.

946
01:08:29,041 --> 01:08:31,041
Pratima madam has sent this letter for you.

947
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:35,041
 Pratima!

948
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:39,541
 She sent her reply pretty soon!

949
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,125
Today, I am coming at 7 o'clock to talk about my marriage.

950
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:55,333
 You are my God.

951
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:58,000
 My happiness lies in yours.

952
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:03,166
I will do whatever you want. Pratima.

953
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:05,208
 Ramu! Birju!

954
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:06,708
Where is everybody? - Yes, sir.

955
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:10,500
Pratima is coming. Cook all her favorite dishes.

956
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,916
 You go and get some flowers.

957
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:13,875
 You bring fruits. You bring sweets.

958
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:15,708
 And.. what else does she like?

959
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:17,208
 Bring everything!

960
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:21,208
 I want everything within an hour!

961
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:28,041
 Pratima! Come!

962
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:39,916
 Sit!

963
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:42,333
 What will you have?

964
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:48,958
 Nothing. Did you receive my letter?

965
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:51,541
 We will talk about the letter later.

966
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:54,416
 What will you have to eat and drink?

967
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:59,541
Not now. First let me talk about this matter.

968
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:04,708
 Fine. As you wish.

969
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:08,500
You know that I am alone in this world.

970
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,833
 I don't have anybody besides you.

971
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:17,125
I have come to you to know your opinion.

972
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,875
 My opinion?

973
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:23,166
 That's the way it is.

974
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:24,875
 It's the norm of nature.

975
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:29,250
Every woman's life is incomplete without a man.

976
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,333
 That's true.

977
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:35,333
 That's why.. I..

978
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:43,541
 I understood. Look, Pratima.

979
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:50,708
Marriage is not a bond which can be broken easily.

980
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:54,291
 This is a sacred bond.

981
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:59,125
There are many joys and happiness in this world.

982
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:04,000
 This joy has its own place.

983
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,666
 Husband and wife's relationship..

984
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:11,666
 ..is very delicate and intense.

985
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:17,916
If you don't want this, you can refuse.

986
01:12:18,416 --> 01:12:22,416
My respect for you will elevate.. and not decline.

987
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:28,000
It's good that you understood everything before I spoke.

988
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,166
 You are so kind.

989
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:33,791
No flattery. First think about yourself.

990
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:37,000
Before taking such a big step, you should think whether the man..

991
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:43,250
..whom you are going to marry can keep you happy.

992
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:51,166
Boss, I think Chandar will be a good husband.

993
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:54,458
Chandar? - Yes, Chandar.

994
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:57,500
 He has proposed to marry me.

995
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,875
I was wondering on how to begin the conversation with you.

996
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:04,041
 You like him very much.

997
01:13:04,541 --> 01:13:08,208
 You have taken him to great heights.

998
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:12,000
 Even Rani can't live without me.

999
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,791
 She needs a mother's love.

1000
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:19,041
The house where you sent me to pretend as a mother..

1001
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:21,000
..today, I really want to perform the duty of..

1002
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,000
 ..a mother and wife in that house.

1003
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:36,000
Pratima, its very difficult to find..

1004
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,541
..a good girl like you in this world.

1005
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:42,166
You have chosen such a good life partner.

1006
01:13:42,666 --> 01:13:46,916
Chandar is very fortunate. Go and make preparations for marriage.

1007
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:50,916
 I will meet all the expenses.

1008
01:13:53,833 --> 01:13:55,208
 Live happily.

1009
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:59,208
Shall I leave? - All right.

1010
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,625
 Oh dear Pratima, so you are here?

1011
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:06,541
 I searched high and low for you.

1012
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:09,708
Mr. Rajan has.. - Uncle Dinu, please come here.

1013
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:13,708
 You go, Pratima.

1014
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,166
Uncle. - Yes, son?

1015
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:25,916
Return that letter to me. - Here.

1016
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:29,875
Dear, is the marriage fixed? - Yes, father.

1017
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:31,958
 O' God, thank you so much!

1018
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:38,166
With Chandar! - What are you saying, Rajju?

1019
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:42,958
Uncle, I always give something to the world..

1020
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:45,583
..and I have given today as well. - No!

1021
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:49,583
 No, Rajju!

1022
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:49,291
Uncle, why is papa putting a garland round mummy's neck?

1023
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:52,541
Munni, your papa and mummy are getting married.

1024
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:59,708
Really? When will you get married, uncle?

1025
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:03,708
 Munni, after you get married.

1026
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:14,541
 May, God bless you both.

1027
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:19,750
Pratima, I never missed anything in my life..

1028
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:23,416
..but the factory will surely miss you.

1029
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:28,416
The workers will feel miserable watching your empty chair.

1030
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:32,416
Still, we wish that you both prosper in your life.

1031
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:41,458
This is a gift on behalf of the factory. A golden pigeon.

1032
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:57,958
Chandar, stretch your hand towards me.

1033
01:16:58,458 --> 01:17:03,875
This ring suits better in the finger of a married man.

1034
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:12,000
Keep it carefully. Uncle Dinu.. this is the key of my new bungalow.

1035
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,666
Today on, that bungalow belongs to you both.

1036
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:16,208
But I won't give it for free. I'm a businessman..

1037
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,833
..I will definitely take something in return.

1038
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:20,916
 Command me, boss.

1039
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:23,208
 You will have to permit me to play..

1040
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:26,208
 ..with Munni daily at that bungalow.

1041
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:31,458
You are asking permission from me, boss? You are an angel.

1042
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:34,666
You have always given something to the world all your life.

1043
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:37,333
 You had given us a lot too.

1044
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:40,000
Today, you gave us this new bungalow.

1045
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:44,791
The giver never becomes bankrupt, nor will he ever.

1046
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:47,458
 Who am I to give anything to anyone?

1047
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:52,541
God gives me and I distribute it to the people on His behalf.

1048
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:56,541
 Chandar, meet your friends.

1049
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:05,000
Dear Rajju, you didn't do the right thing..

1050
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,125
 ..by giving your ring to Chandar.

1051
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:11,041
This ring was the symbol of your family's fortune, dear.

1052
01:18:11,541 --> 01:18:15,041
Uncle Dinu, a man's destiny is not written in a ring, but here.

1053
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:35,541
 What's wrong?

1054
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:38,416
Boss, four months have passed since Pratima's marriage.

1055
01:18:38,916 --> 01:18:40,875
There is overload of work at the office.

1056
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:43,416
 You have many responsibilities.

1057
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:46,333
 Why don't you hire a new secretary?

1058
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:50,666
Mr. Ram Prasad, the chair which Pratima has vacated..

1059
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:51,875
 ..that will always be that way.

1060
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:56,750
I'll shoot you! Hi, Lollypop! - Hi.

1061
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:59,083
Where is your ice-cream? Did she run away?

1062
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:02,708
Hey? Which ice-cream? - That fraud and cheater, Pratima.

1063
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:05,541
She eloped with one of your workers. - Don't talk rubbish!

1064
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:06,875
She didn't run away, she's got married.

1065
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,625
What nonsense! Which fool will ever marry her?

1066
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:11,750
Neither she has a beautiful face, nor is she attractive.

1067
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,625
Tell me something, Chandni. - Yes?

1068
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,333
You were not spotted in this office since many days.

1069
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:20,583
Pal, don't you know, I had gone for honeymoon.

1070
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:24,333
Darjeeling, Nainital, Kullu Manali, Uttakanam.

1071
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:26,541
 Congratulations!

1072
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:29,500
So you got married at last! - What nonsense!

1073
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,500
Who has got married? - Then this honeymoon!?

1074
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,791
With my boyfriend. - I see! God bless him. Good.

1075
01:19:37,291 --> 01:19:39,750
What God? When I will get married to you..

1076
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:43,708
..I will go on a honeymoon for the second time.

1077
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:48,125
Darling, instead of honeymoon, its better you go to the moon.

1078
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:50,500
What? - You go; I have to do my work.

1079
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,500
Didn't you hear it is a crime to work?

1080
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,500
 Oh! It's 12 30!

1081
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,083
I've given an appointment to 3-4 boys at 12 o' clock.

1082
01:19:57,583 --> 01:20:00,458
Poor ones must be waiting impatiently outside the restaurant.

1083
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:03,333
Okay, bye. Oh! Please give me 100 rupees, pal.

1084
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:06,250
I will spend on the guys and they'll become happy.

1085
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,541
Why? Doesn't your daddy give you money nowadays?

1086
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:10,208
 Daddy gives money only on interest..

1087
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:12,541
 ..and I don't want to pay that.

1088
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:18,875
All right. Here. Take 200 rupees instead. - Thanks.

1089
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:22,291
And do me a favor by not coming to this office for 5-6 months.

1090
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:25,875
Why this condition? This office is my would-be office..

1091
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,625
 ..and your house is my future abode.

1092
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:31,625
And you are my future.. Bye.

1093
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:43,041
Pratima! - Welcome, boss.

1094
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:47,166
Don't call me boss now. The matter of office is restricted to office.

1095
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:49,583
Where is Munni? - She has gone to play..

1096
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:51,291
..in the neighborhood, she must be coming.

1097
01:20:51,791 --> 01:20:54,333
I've brought two tickets for Chandar and you.

1098
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:55,875
These are the tickets of a very good English movie.

1099
01:20:56,375 --> 01:20:58,208
Only two? And Rani? - She will play here with me..

1100
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:01,416
..and you both will go to watch the movie.

1101
01:21:01,916 --> 01:21:04,625
Good evening, boss. - Good evening, Chandar.

1102
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:08,625
 Looking very smart!

1103
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:16,875
 Congratulations, Chandar.

1104
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:19,875
Now a baby boy will arrive to play with Munni.

1105
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:24,125
Thank you, boss. Uncle! What have you brought for me?

1106
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:26,625
Oh! I am sorry; I forgot to bring anything.

1107
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:35,166
Uncle is a liar! A chocolate is winking at me from uncle's pocket.

1108
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:37,416
 Saw, Pratima? She is so sharp.

1109
01:21:37,916 --> 01:21:41,416
She has two eyes in front and two behind.

1110
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:58,291
 Hello? Yes, speaking.

1111
01:21:58,791 --> 01:22:02,208
 What's wrong?

1112
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:06,208
 What!?

1113
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:11,000
What happened, Rajju? What's wrong?

1114
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:14,875
What's the matter, son? Why don't you say anything, Rajju?

1115
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:19,250
Rajju!? What's wrong?! - Nothing, uncle.

1116
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:22,416
I had purchased the share of a foreign company..

1117
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:24,500
..and that company has gone bankrupt.

1118
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,125
It has gone bankrupt? What loss did you incur, dear?

1119
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:32,708
50 lakh rupees. - 50 lakhs!?

1120
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:36,791
Never mind, dear. There are ups and downs in life.

1121
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:39,958
One wave takes a man towards the whirlpool..

1122
01:22:40,458 --> 01:22:43,416
..and the other wave brings him to the shore.

1123
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:45,458
Don't take such things seriously, dear.

1124
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:48,166
God will give you more; he will give you double than this.

1125
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:52,166
Right, Rajju? - Yes.

1126
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:07,625
 Here.

1127
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:16,541
These are your wife's signatures, right? - Of course.

1128
01:23:17,041 --> 01:23:24,208
Very good. May God prosper your factory!

1129
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:30,250
And I don't have to mortgage your bungalow.

1130
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:35,125
Here, take your amount. Total 2 lakh rupees.

1131
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:38,541
Mr. Dalpatram, is the entire amount given in 1 rupee notes?

1132
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:42,208
Yes. Nowadays, there are rumors that government..

1133
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:45,625
..will change 5, 10 and 100 rupee notes.

1134
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:49,208
That's why I arranged your amount in one rupee notes.

1135
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:50,583
Its okay, isn't it? - Yes.

1136
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:54,583
Okay, Mr. Chandar, I take your leave now.

1137
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:11,333
Firstly, you have taken the loan with 3% interest per month.

1138
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:14,166
Above that, you have mortgaged the house too.

1139
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:16,041
 Remember, Chandar?

1140
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:19,958
Boss had given us this house lovingly, as our marriage gift.

1141
01:24:20,458 --> 01:24:23,875
By mortgaging this house, we've humiliated such a..

1142
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:27,000
 ..good man who lives for others.

1143
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,916
If I didn't mortgage the house, from where I'd have..

1144
01:24:29,416 --> 01:24:32,166
..got the finance to invest in the factory?

1145
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:34,541
 I can't beg on the streets, right?

1146
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:38,666
Instead of humiliating someone's love, it's better to beg.

1147
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:41,208
If boss comes to know that we've mortgaged..

1148
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:45,541
..the house he had gifted us, what will he think about us?

1149
01:24:46,041 --> 01:24:48,750
Even he won't be as shocked as you, Pratima.

1150
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,791
Now stop thinking about boss in every matter.

1151
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:53,208
We should think about our benefit too.

1152
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:55,291
 I am going to start a new business.

1153
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:59,291
Don't argue and nag and obstruct my work.

1154
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:16,875
All the best! - Thank you, boss. Please come.

1155
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:33,791
'Eagle Brand Matchbox has become such a big company!?'

1156
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:43,250
'Kabutar is still a lion in front of Eagle.'

1157
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:47,208
Mr. Work Manager, why wasn't this order sent on time?

1158
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:48,875
 You know my principles.

1159
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:51,708
Not even a second should be wasted, time is money.

1160
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:53,208
Eagle Brand matchbox sales are increasing day by day..

1161
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:55,791
..we are getting orders in abundance.

1162
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:59,166
If you work in this way, how will we meet these orders?

1163
01:26:59,666 --> 01:27:02,541
The first principle of business is to supply on time.

1164
01:27:03,041 --> 01:27:05,041
Understood? - Yes, boss.

1165
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:07,250
No, cancel all the appointments today.

1166
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:08,875
And yes, call up Mr. Jang and tell him that..

1167
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:10,791
..I'll meet him after returning from Calcutta.

1168
01:27:11,291 --> 01:27:13,541
 That's right. Fine.

1169
01:27:14,041 --> 01:27:15,583
Please come. Have a seat. Please sit here.

1170
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:16,791
 Make a call at Calcutta and..

1171
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:18,458
..inform them to send the car to the airport.

1172
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:20,958
 Yeah. Fine.

1173
01:27:21,458 --> 01:27:23,708
Yes? What is the purpose of your visit?

1174
01:27:24,208 --> 01:27:27,541
Today, I've come to reduce the burden of my heart.

1175
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:32,541
What's wrong? - Our boss is going bankrupt day by day.

1176
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:34,500
 Why? What happened?

1177
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:35,625
 He had purchased shares worth..

1178
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:38,708
..50 lakh rupees from a foreign company.

1179
01:27:39,208 --> 01:27:41,041
 That company went bankrupt.

1180
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:45,041
After that, he purchased stuff for his matchbox factory.

1181
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:49,000
Then it rained during the night, the godown roof was leaking..

1182
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,291
..all the stuff got drenched and became useless.

1183
01:27:51,791 --> 01:27:55,083
This also caused a loss of 8-10 lakh rupees.

1184
01:27:55,583 --> 01:28:01,416
And now the condition of the factory is like an orphan kid!

1185
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:04,458
Oh! I see! I explained boss several times..

1186
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:06,416
..that a man should change with time.

1187
01:28:06,916 --> 01:28:10,166
Boss will never change. In such a financial crisis too..

1188
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:15,583
..he is taking loans on interest and donating the poor.

1189
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:19,750
All these things will lead him towards destruction.

1190
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:22,666
Not lead him, sir. He is already ruined.

1191
01:28:23,166 --> 01:28:27,208
You have really disturbed me by giving me this news.

1192
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:30,125
 Well, never mind.

1193
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:33,208
Today, I'm going to Calcutta, related to a business deal.

1194
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:35,583
 And it is very important that I go.

1195
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:39,583
I'll return after few days and try to explain things to boss once again.

1196
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:53,416
Doctor, how is Pratima? - It is an ordinary problem.

1197
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:55,208
 Please bring this injection.

1198
01:28:55,708 --> 01:28:59,208
Uncle, bring this injection immediately.

1199
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:07,625
Rajju. - Yes, uncle?

1200
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:10,416
You have not eaten anything since last two days..

1201
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:13,166
..nor you have taken rest for a while.

1202
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:17,333
To sleep, take rest and eat is the daily routine, uncle.

1203
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:19,333
 Chandar has not returned yet.

1204
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:22,458
Who else does Pratima has as her relatives? Only we.

1205
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:26,041
Mr. Rajan, congratulations. It's a baby boy.

1206
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:29,541
Baby boy! Thank you, doctor. How is Pratima?

1207
01:29:30,041 --> 01:29:33,625
A mother forgets all her sorrows seeing the child.

1208
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:36,208
 Look here.

1209
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:40,208
 He is a doll! Sweet boy!

1210
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,583
 Live long, dear!

1211
01:29:57,083 --> 01:29:58,083
 Live long, dear!

1212
01:29:58,583 --> 01:30:00,541
Good morning, boss. - Oh Chandar, so you have arrived!

1213
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:04,541
Congratulations! Your son is exactly like you.

1214
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:13,958
Munna's father, first go and meet your son's mother.

1215
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:17,958
 Go and meet your wife.

1216
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:25,541
Come, Mr. Dalpatram. Have a seat. How are you?

1217
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:29,541
I am fine, you tell me about yourself, sir.

1218
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:37,041
So you have come now? - I'm sorry, Pratima.

1219
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:41,291
The business matter had taken lead, so I was delayed.

1220
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:42,083
 Munna is very sweet!

1221
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:44,125
 Forget about me and Munna.

1222
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:46,750
First go and ask boss to eat something.

1223
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:48,875
He is sitting like a statue since last two days.

1224
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:53,166
He has not slept, taken rest or eaten anything.

1225
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:57,166
Boss has a habit to live for others. I'll be right back.

1226
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,916
 So, how is your factory running?

1227
01:31:10,416 --> 01:31:13,458
Not just running, Mr. Dalpatram, it is progressing.

1228
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:16,541
 It will be defunct some day, sir.

1229
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:21,625
Boss, you took so much care of Pratima in my absence..

1230
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:24,041
 ..how should I thank you?

1231
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:31,833
Chandar, don't call duty as favor and insult me.

1232
01:31:32,333 --> 01:31:34,708
If you don't mind, shall I ask you one thing?

1233
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:37,750
 Why are you feeling shy? Go ahead.

1234
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:41,541
I've heard you incurred a huge loss in business.

1235
01:31:42,041 --> 01:31:44,125
There are only two things in business, Chandar.

1236
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:46,708
 Profit or loss!

1237
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:50,708
Boss, if you think with a cool mind, our factories can unite.

1238
01:31:58,791 --> 01:32:01,083
 Union of Eagle and Kabutar!?

1239
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:02,541
 Did you hear, uncle?

1240
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:08,958
Chandar is saying Eagle and Kabutar brand can unite.

1241
01:32:09,458 --> 01:32:12,833
Chandar, this Kabutar brand matchbox..

1242
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:15,083
..is the foundation of Lakshmi Mansion.

1243
01:32:15,583 --> 01:32:18,333
And Lakshmi Mansion doesn't need anyone's support.

1244
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:21,708
Those who lived at Lakshmi Mansion have..

1245
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:25,750
..always given something, they never accepted a thing.

1246
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:28,041
 The days of giving are gone, sir.

1247
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:29,916
 Now the days to take will arrive.

1248
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:33,833
Mr. Dalpatram, are you aware with whom you are talking?

1249
01:32:34,333 --> 01:32:37,916
 Mr. Rajan, why this fake pride?

1250
01:32:38,416 --> 01:32:41,000
 Go and hear the talks at the market.

1251
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,000
 No one is ready to buy your stuff..

1252
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,833
..nor is anyone ready to give you a loan.

1253
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:51,041
Perhaps, you may go bankrupt in few days. - Mr. Dalpatram!

1254
01:32:51,541 --> 01:32:55,208
Mr. Rajan, don't talk with uncouth men!

1255
01:32:55,708 --> 01:32:57,958
 Remember one thing, Mr. Dalpatram.

1256
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:01,666
You are greedy of wealth. You have always looted wealth..

1257
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:03,875
 ..and I have always distributed it.

1258
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:07,875
And I will distribute till I breathe my last.

1259
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:15,666
Good morning, sir. - Good morning, boss.

1260
01:33:16,166 --> 01:33:19,666
Give me a matchbox. - Here, sir.

1261
01:33:27,916 --> 01:33:30,541
Eagle brand!? - What to do, boss?

1262
01:33:31,041 --> 01:33:33,666
Wherever from we buy matchbox in the market..

1263
01:33:34,166 --> 01:33:35,833
 ..we get only this brand.

1264
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:40,000
Our Kabutar brand matchbox is not available at any shop.

1265
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,041
You are unfaithful! You are disloyal!

1266
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:47,125
Boss, you call us anything, but don't call us disloyal.

1267
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:48,125
 Since last 4 months we are working..

1268
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:50,750
..silently without getting our salary.

1269
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:54,458
If wished, we could have gone to some other factory.

1270
01:33:54,958 --> 01:33:57,416
So this is the proof of your loyalty.

1271
01:33:57,916 --> 01:34:00,416
There are 60 matchsticks in Kabutar brand matchbox.

1272
01:34:00,916 --> 01:34:02,333
Instead of that, you are buying Eagle..

1273
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:04,208
..brand's matchbox with 50 matchsticks!?

1274
01:34:04,708 --> 01:34:06,375
 That too by giving one paisa more?

1275
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:09,541
You are being disloyal to your own master?

1276
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:11,333
 Boss, from Kabutar brand matchbox..

1277
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:14,791
..one match stick lights while the other doesn't.

1278
01:34:15,291 --> 01:34:19,250
But all the 50 matchsticks of Eagle brand matchbox light perfectly.

1279
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:23,250
Does anyone have our factory's matchbox? - Here.

1280
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:30,083
Now I'll see whether all the matchsticks light.

1281
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:43,541
 Cheating! Dishonesty!

1282
01:34:44,041 --> 01:34:46,541
Lakshmi Mansion's Kabutar brand factory is..

1283
01:34:47,041 --> 01:34:49,625
..manufacturing such useless matchsticks nowadays?

1284
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:53,208
They are cheating the public by producing such matchsticks!

1285
01:34:53,708 --> 01:34:57,208
I'll go right now and teach them a lesson!

1286
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:19,833
Foreman! Ramchand! Where have everyone gone?

1287
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:31,125
 No one is present here!

1288
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:34,541
Is anyone here? Where have everyone gone?

1289
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:38,541
 Where the heck have you all gone!?

1290
01:36:01,875 --> 01:36:04,041
Gentlemen, according to the court order,..

1291
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:08,666
..Lakshmi Mansion and other properties of Mr. Rajan are being auctioned.

1292
01:36:09,166 --> 01:36:12,541

 10 lakhs.

10 lakhs - 10 lakhs one, 10 lakhs two!

1299
01:36:25,833 --> 01:36:26,541
 12 lakhs!

1300
01:36:27,041 --> 01:36:29,541
 12 lakh one, 12 lakhs two.

1301
01:36:30,041 --> 01:36:32,416
 12 lakhs one, 12 lakhs two..

1302
01:36:32,916 --> 01:36:37,583
15 lakhs! - 15 lakhs! 15 lakhs one, 15 lakhs two..

1303
01:36:38,083 --> 01:36:40,458
 ..15 lakhs one, 15 lakhs two..

1304
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:42,083
 25 lakhs!

1305
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:47,791
25 lakhs! 25 lakhs one, 25 lakhs two.

1306
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:51,791
 25 lakhs two.. 25 lakhs three!

1307
01:37:07,375 --> 01:37:12,166
What is this? - Boss, we've purchased Lakshmi Mansion.

1308
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:16,166
 Oh really? Congratulations.

1309
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,250
We have not purchased it for ourselves..

1310
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:22,750
..but we have brought it for you in auction.

1311
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:26,750
 For me? - Of course.

1312
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:36,125
Chandar, do you think I've become handicapped?

1313
01:37:36,625 --> 01:37:38,458
 I have become lame or crippled?

1314
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:41,500
 My hands have broken?

1315
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,750
I still have the strength to fight with life, Chandar.

1316
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:51,750
This house is yours. Now you stay happily in this house.

1317
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:03,125
 Lakshmi Mansion is not ours.

1318
01:38:03,625 --> 01:38:08,083
It belonged to you and it will always be yours.

1319
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:14,041
 Pratima, you know me very well.

1320
01:38:14,541 --> 01:38:20,458
Don't force me to die by giving me these alms.

1321
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:23,916
 Do you consider us strangers now?

1322
01:38:24,416 --> 01:38:29,916
Uncle, if you won't stay here, I'll become upset.

1323
01:38:30,416 --> 01:38:34,583
 No, Munni, don't weep.

1324
01:38:35,083 --> 01:38:38,833
I won't let you become upset at any cost.

1325
01:38:39,333 --> 01:38:42,833
Never think that I'll go away far from you.

1326
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,833
I'll stay in the small house adjacent to Laxmi Mansion.

1327
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:53,208
What!? Will you stay in that dilapidated house!?

1328
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:58,083
Why not? I just want a land below and sky over my head.

1329
01:38:58,583 --> 01:39:01,125
 I won't stay there for free.

1330
01:39:01,625 --> 01:39:02,916
 I will give its rent.

1331
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:06,500
Boss, there is a limit of being stubborn.

1332
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,291
Okay, if you consider it my stubbornness, I'll go elsewhere.

1333
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:17,875
Boss, as you wish. You stay in that house.

1334
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:25,166
Uncle Dinu, keep my clothes and stuff in the outhouse.

1335
01:39:25,666 --> 01:39:29,166
Come, Munni. I'll show you my new house today.

1336
01:39:46,041 --> 01:39:49,541
'I'm giving a sighing glance to the walls of my house.'

1337
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:53,541
'Live happily, people of my country, I'm just a traveler.'

1338
01:40:18,875 --> 01:40:20,000
Uncle. - Yes?

1339
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:24,166
Will you stay in this house? Ghosts must be dwelling here.

1340
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:27,208
Dear, I am a ghost. - Stop joking.

1341
01:40:27,708 --> 01:40:31,458
This old house is not fit for you. Please come.

1342
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:32,958
 Munni, don't insist.

1343
01:40:33,458 --> 01:40:37,166
You have seen God dwelling in the old temple, right?

1344
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:39,541
When God can dwell in the old temple..

1345
01:40:40,041 --> 01:40:42,208
..why can't I live in this old house?

1346
01:40:42,708 --> 01:40:45,625
 O Almighty, what have you done!?

1347
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:49,250
I had given a loan of 2 lakh rupees to Chandar on 3 % interest.

1348
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:52,041
 So that is he always indebted to me.

1349
01:40:52,541 --> 01:40:55,750
But you made his factory prosper with my money?

1350
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:59,166
Chandar has made a big loss to me by returning my sum.

1351
01:40:59,666 --> 01:41:01,333
God, why is this injustice done to me?

1352
01:41:01,833 --> 01:41:04,541
Daddy, you are trying to flatter God?

1353
01:41:05,041 --> 01:41:06,791
 God will never be pleased by you.

1354
01:41:07,291 --> 01:41:10,666
As you offer Him these filthy sweets made by hawkers.

1355
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:16,375
God! My father is a stingy man! He is a real miser!

1356
01:41:16,875 --> 01:41:21,125
He offers you the cheapest sweets from the market.

1357
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:24,166
God, I've brought Cadbury-chocolate for you.

1358
01:41:24,666 --> 01:41:25,666
 Eat it, God.

1359
01:41:26,166 --> 01:41:30,000
 God, I want my husband.

1360
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:33,333
Whether I go for honeymoon first and get my husband later.

1361
01:41:33,833 --> 01:41:36,166
Whether I get my husband first and honeymoon later.

1362
01:41:36,666 --> 01:41:38,291
Anything will be fine with me, God.

1363
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:40,375
 God, remember one thing.

1364
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:43,916
I've brought this chocolate for 2 rupees and 90 paisa.

1365
01:41:44,416 --> 01:41:48,208
And my daddy's sweet ball costs only 10 paisa.

1366
01:41:48,708 --> 01:41:51,583
Don't listen to him, God. Listen to me.

1367
01:41:52,083 --> 01:41:58,958
Goodbye. God, please answer my prayers, okay? Bye, God!

1368
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:05,041
Did you see, God? She is my daughter. A loss here too!

1369
01:42:05,541 --> 01:42:09,375
Uncle! - Oh Munni! Take this.

1370
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,541
Hey? Where from you brought this toy?

1371
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:14,833
 Papa has brought this toy for me.

1372
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:18,625
Really? - Yes, uncle. Watch, it's such a strange toy.

1373
01:42:19,125 --> 01:42:22,625
When you place it on the table it sways from here to there.

1374
01:42:30,666 --> 01:42:35,166
 It doesn't fall.

1375
01:42:35,666 --> 01:42:41,750
Dear, this toy is an example of my life.

1376
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:45,750
 I am such a toy.

1377
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:11,583
 "I am such a toy."

1378
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:17,333
 "I am such a toy."

1379
01:43:17,833 --> 01:43:20,083
"I will sway, turn and bend either way..

1380
01:43:20,583 --> 01:43:22,375
 ..but I will never fall.

1381
01:43:22,875 --> 01:43:25,166
 I will never fall."

1382
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:30,541
 "I am such a toy."

1383
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:36,250
 "I am such a toy."

1384
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,958
"I will sway, turn and bend either way..

1385
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:41,333
 ..but I will never fall.

1386
01:43:41,833 --> 01:43:44,000
 I will never fall."

1387
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:49,375
 "I am such a toy."

1388
01:43:49,875 --> 01:43:53,375
 "I am such a toy."

1389
01:44:16,666 --> 01:44:27,000
"I've seen many storms and undergone many difficulties."

1390
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:37,500
"I've seen many storms and undergone many difficulties."

1391
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:48,833
"But I didn't changed style, though the days and nights changed."

1392
01:44:49,333 --> 01:44:53,833
"It's my heart and my wish, why should I listen to others?"

1393
01:44:54,333 --> 01:44:59,208
 "I am such a toy."

1394
01:44:59,708 --> 01:45:04,833
 "I am such a toy."

1395
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:07,541
"I will sway, turn and bend either way..

1396
01:45:08,041 --> 01:45:09,916
 ..but I will never fall.

1397
01:45:10,416 --> 01:45:12,583
 I will never fall."

1398
01:45:13,083 --> 01:45:17,916
 "I am such a toy."

1399
01:45:18,416 --> 01:45:21,916
 "I am such a toy."

1400
01:45:44,541 --> 01:45:49,458
"I don't have to take anything from anyone..

1401
01:45:49,958 --> 01:45:54,541
 ..I have always learned to give."

1402
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:59,750
"I don't have to take anything from anyone..

1403
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:05,250
 ..I have always learned to give."

1404
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:16,208
"Whether anyone understands or not, my life is a style."

1405
01:46:16,708 --> 01:46:21,166
"My smile and my tears, everything is mine."

1406
01:46:21,666 --> 01:46:26,458
 "I am such a toy."

1407
01:46:26,958 --> 01:46:32,041
 "I am such a toy."

1408
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:34,666
"I will sway, turn and bend either way..

1409
01:46:35,166 --> 01:46:37,041
 ..but I will never fall.

1410
01:46:37,541 --> 01:46:39,750
 I will never fall."

1411
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:45,125
 "I am such a toy."

1412
01:46:45,625 --> 01:46:49,125
 "I am such a toy."

1413
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:05,833
 What's wrong, Pratima?

1414
01:47:06,333 --> 01:47:07,333
 You take the morsel to your mouth..

1415
01:47:07,833 --> 01:47:09,791
 ..and then you bring your hand down.

1416
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:16,250
I wonder of the man, due to whom these dishes got cooked..

1417
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:19,708
 ..if that has man eaten food today.

1418
01:47:20,208 --> 01:47:22,708
Boss is always welcome to eat food in this house.

1419
01:47:23,208 --> 01:47:27,000
But he will never agree. You convince him.

1420
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,083
 How should I cajole him?

1421
01:47:29,583 --> 01:47:33,958
A man can tear apart the mountains, he can turn away the storms..

1422
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:37,958
..but no one can change the decision of Lakshmi Mansion's boss.

1423
01:47:41,625 --> 01:47:45,708
Perhaps, this is the specialty of Lakshmi Mansion.

1424
01:47:46,208 --> 01:47:53,833
Lakshmi Mansion! Boss! Boss's secretary! My wife!

1425
01:47:54,333 --> 01:47:56,958
 Life is very complicated!

1426
01:47:57,458 --> 01:48:00,958
 Life is a strange puzzle.

1427
01:48:09,541 --> 01:48:14,208
Rajju, I've cooked only pulse and rice today.

1428
01:48:14,708 --> 01:48:18,000
It's all right, uncle. It is the matter of times.

1429
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:23,416
Let it be pulse and rice, but the plate is made of silver.

1430
01:48:23,916 --> 01:48:26,875
And this plate will come to my use when..

1431
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:30,875
..a man doesn't seek anything from anyone.

1432
01:48:42,666 --> 01:48:47,958
Pratima! - Yes?

1433
01:48:48,458 --> 01:48:52,208
What's wrong? You bring up some new issue every day.

1434
01:48:52,708 --> 01:48:53,416
 Instead of sleeping on the bed..

1435
01:48:53,916 --> 01:48:55,958
..why are you sleeping on the ground?

1436
01:48:56,458 --> 01:49:00,916
I'm sorry. But I can't get sleep on a soft mattress.

1437
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:03,583
For the man these mattresses were meant for..

1438
01:49:04,083 --> 01:49:05,666
..he must be sleeping on a cot today.

1439
01:49:06,166 --> 01:49:12,083
I'm noticing since few days, you are exaggerating the matter.

1440
01:49:12,583 --> 01:49:14,916
 Don't blame others for your deeds.

1441
01:49:15,416 --> 01:49:18,958
Tell me once, what crime have I committed?

1442
01:49:19,458 --> 01:49:21,875
 If you wanted to do any business..

1443
01:49:22,375 --> 01:49:25,541
..did you have only the option of a matchbox factory?

1444
01:49:26,041 --> 01:49:30,208
You didn't think of anything except competing with your boss?

1445
01:49:30,708 --> 01:49:32,541
I've done everything in front of you.

1446
01:49:33,041 --> 01:49:36,541
And I explained to boss so often that we'll unite our factories.

1447
01:49:37,041 --> 01:49:39,208
 Who can win over a stubborn man!

1448
01:49:39,708 --> 01:49:41,958
 I have always fulfilled my duty.

1449
01:49:42,458 --> 01:49:45,500
 He's always made fun of me.

1450
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Perhaps, he is jealous of my progress.

1451
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:55,208
I know him inside out. He can never be jealous of anyone.

1452
01:49:55,708 --> 01:49:59,208
Now I am sure that even you are jealous of my progress.

1453
01:50:09,041 --> 01:50:11,250
 What should I do?

1454
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:14,000
Calm down, Munna. - What's wrong, Munni?

1455
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:14,875
 Why is the doll weeping?

1456
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:18,166
I don't know, uncle. He is not ready to calm down.

1457
01:50:18,666 --> 01:50:23,500
 Oh! Come on, come to me. No..

1458
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,625
 Oh..! Watch this!

1459
01:50:27,125 --> 01:50:29,458
 Watch this! Look at this!

1460
01:50:29,958 --> 01:50:32,625
 Oh wow! Saw, Munni?

1461
01:50:33,125 --> 01:50:35,375
Oh! He has calmed down watching the pigeon.

1462
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:37,416
 Munna, this is uncle's pigeon.

1463
01:50:37,916 --> 01:50:41,416
The pigeon loves uncle and uncle loves the pigeon.

1464
01:50:57,208 --> 01:51:01,166
Pratima, why didn't you send lunch to the office today?

1465
01:51:01,666 --> 01:51:04,458
What's wrong? - Nothing new.

1466
01:51:04,958 --> 01:51:07,000
If not anything new, then what is the old thing?

1467
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:11,791
You can understand it. - I do understand.

1468
01:51:12,291 --> 01:51:14,041
 You always keep thinking that boss..

1469
01:51:14,541 --> 01:51:17,791
..owned a matchbox factory, now I own it too.

1470
01:51:18,291 --> 01:51:19,958
First he had a car, now I too have one.

1471
01:51:20,458 --> 01:51:21,333
First boss used to live in Lakshmi Mansion..

1472
01:51:21,833 --> 01:51:22,875
 ..now I live in it.

1473
01:51:23,375 --> 01:51:24,333
At first, boss was the Mayor of this city..

1474
01:51:24,833 --> 01:51:26,250
..and now I'm going to become the Mayor.

1475
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:30,791
Not only the world; now my wife is also jealous of my success.

1476
01:51:31,291 --> 01:51:32,791
 Why are you getting angry?

1477
01:51:33,291 --> 01:51:36,708
I'm asking justice for such a man who is God for us.

1478
01:51:37,208 --> 01:51:39,166
 You know that he is heartbroken.

1479
01:51:39,666 --> 01:51:42,583
At least go once and ask him what problem he has.

1480
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:45,208
Pratima, it will be useless for me to go there.

1481
01:51:45,708 --> 01:51:48,250
When a man is disappointed, sometimes a few words of..

1482
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:51,041
 ..sympathy also hurts him very much.

1483
01:51:51,541 --> 01:51:55,375
Seeing me, boss will think, at one time we were..

1484
01:51:55,875 --> 01:51:58,333
..dependant on him and today we are so wealthy.

1485
01:51:58,833 --> 01:52:00,666
There is no harm for you to go there.

1486
01:52:01,166 --> 01:52:03,166
 You can't blame him sitting at home.

1487
01:52:03,666 --> 01:52:05,791
 I don't know where I am trapped!

1488
01:52:06,291 --> 01:52:09,333
Sometimes I think, just to make me jealous a haughty..

1489
01:52:09,833 --> 01:52:12,833
..man has started living in ruins abandoning a palace.

1490
01:52:13,333 --> 01:52:16,666
Pratima, I can see your fiery glance.

1491
01:52:17,166 --> 01:52:19,333
 This house has become a heck for me.

1492
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:23,333
If I stay on in this house, I'll burn in fire of this hell!

1493
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,916
Sir, shall I bring tea and grilled sandwich? - No.

1494
01:52:35,416 --> 01:52:38,083
Bring one whiskey. - Whiskey?

1495
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:41,541
Sir, you used to only have tea and sandwich earlier but today..

1496
01:52:42,041 --> 01:52:45,541
Don't argue. Go and bring what I've ordered. - Okay.

1497
01:52:54,416 --> 01:52:57,916
Bring one more. - Okay.

1498
01:53:07,416 --> 01:53:10,916
 Bring the entire bottle.

1499
01:53:19,125 --> 01:53:21,166
Rajju! - What's the matter, uncle?

1500
01:53:21,666 --> 01:53:25,000
I've heard Chandar's got appointed as the corporation Mayor.

1501
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:28,500
 Really? It is good news.

1502
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,416
Dear Rajju, you were the Mayor for five years.

1503
01:53:33,916 --> 01:53:36,333
 Now the people have forgotten you.

1504
01:53:36,833 --> 01:53:41,166
It is true. The world worships the rising sun.

1505
01:53:41,666 --> 01:53:46,541
Uncle, whether the sun rises or sets, it remains a sun.

1506
01:53:47,041 --> 01:53:51,458
It is a matter of times, dear. Even we had good times.

1507
01:53:51,958 --> 01:53:55,458
Uncle, the man who only knows to give..

1508
01:53:55,958 --> 01:54:01,083
..you shouldn't remind him when he can't.

1509
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:03,916
And a new Mayor is appointed every year.

1510
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:06,625
 No one owns this world.

1511
01:54:07,125 --> 01:54:09,958
Its nice that Chandar got appointed as the Mayor.

1512
01:54:10,458 --> 01:54:14,125
He is our dear one. Our dear one is appointed after all.

1513
01:54:14,625 --> 01:54:19,166
Uncle, Pratima will be so happy hearing this.

1514
01:54:19,666 --> 01:54:23,166
A wife has a big share in husband's honour and fame.

1515
01:54:36,041 --> 01:54:41,541
Even an empty bottle of wine was never spotted in Lakshmi Mansion.

1516
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:43,750
My friends forced me to give a party at Lakshmi Mansion..

1517
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:46,750
..in the good news of becoming a Mayor.

1518
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:51,125
Shall I call them at home and serve them lemon juice?

1519
01:54:51,625 --> 01:54:54,541
What effect will all this have on our children?

1520
01:54:55,041 --> 01:54:58,541
Mind your own business and let me do my work.

1521
01:55:02,541 --> 01:55:06,041
Cheers! - Cheers!

1522
01:55:48,083 --> 01:55:53,375
"O' darling, fill the goblet with wine."

1523
01:55:53,875 --> 01:55:55,583
"O' darling, fill the goblet with wine."

1524
01:55:56,083 --> 01:55:58,416
"The evening has arrived with a bang."

1525
01:55:58,916 --> 01:56:01,875
 "Let's get defamed because..

1526
01:56:02,375 --> 01:56:07,166

01:56:07,666 --> 01:56:09,541

1528

 "Fun is the best thing.

1541
01:57:31,666 --> 01:57:35,250
 Let's have some fun."

1542
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:40,958
"Let the world blame us, we're not concerned with the world."

1543

02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:04,750
 Stop it!

1566
02:00:14,208 --> 02:00:17,166
 This is a house and not a club!

1567
02:00:17,666 --> 02:00:23,416
Chandar, you have reached the heck so soon after being successful?

1568
02:00:23,916 --> 02:00:25,500
 This is Lakshmi Mansion, Chandar.

1569
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,416
People used to wash their feet before entering this house.

1570
02:00:29,916 --> 02:00:31,750
And today you are flowing wine over here!?

1571
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:34,541
Prostitutes never danced here, venerations were held.

1572
02:00:35,041 --> 02:00:37,416
Yagya (large scale veneration) was offered.

1573
02:00:37,916 --> 02:00:40,083
 Donations were distributed.

1574
02:00:40,583 --> 02:00:46,166
This house is a temple. The souls of my ancestors reside here.

1575
02:00:46,666 --> 02:00:49,791
People like you are not fit to stay in this house. Get out of here!

1576
02:00:50,291 --> 02:00:52,000
Mr. Rajan, in your fit of anger you've forgotten..

1577
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:54,833
..that this house doesn't belong to you.

1578
02:00:55,333 --> 02:00:58,916
And in front of whom you are humiliating me, they are my friends.

1579
02:00:59,416 --> 02:01:02,541
Those who make others go astray for their self-interest..

1580
02:01:03,041 --> 02:01:03,833
 ..they can never be good friends.

1581
02:01:04,333 --> 02:01:08,083
Mr. Rajan, I used to respect you till now.

1582
02:01:08,583 --> 02:01:10,958
Today, you are humiliating me in my own house.

1583
02:01:11,458 --> 02:01:12,458
 Get lost from here silently.

1584
02:01:12,958 --> 02:01:18,041
What's going on? You have forgotten humanity getting drunk?

1585
02:01:18,541 --> 02:01:21,583
We can't repay his favors for many births.

1586
02:01:22,083 --> 02:01:23,833
 You have become rich overnight.

1587
02:01:24,333 --> 02:01:27,083
His forefathers had worked hard for years and became wealthy.

1588
02:01:27,583 --> 02:01:29,458
You touch boss's feet and apologize. - Oh shut up!

1589
02:01:29,958 --> 02:01:31,916
 Boss's pet! Boss's darling!

1590
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:36,166
Chandar, you raised hand on Pratima!?

1591
02:01:36,666 --> 02:01:38,625
 You raised hand on your wife!?

1592
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:42,166
You raised hand on your child's mother!? You miscreant!

1593
02:01:42,666 --> 02:01:44,166
 Boss!

1594
02:01:44,666 --> 02:01:45,916
Papa! - I am not your father.

1595
02:01:46,416 --> 02:01:48,833
 Rani!

1596
02:01:49,333 --> 02:01:51,458
Let's go, friends. We are demons and this is a temple.

1597
02:01:51,958 --> 02:01:55,458
Chandar! - Let's go.

1598
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:58,625
 Chandar!

1599
02:01:59,125 --> 02:02:02,625
 Why did you come here?

1600
02:02:05,958 --> 02:02:11,041
Why did I come here? You are saying this!?

1601
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:15,833
 You are saying this, Pratima!?

1602
02:02:16,333 --> 02:02:20,916
I am sorry. I came to a wrong place. Forgive me.

1603
02:02:21,416 --> 02:02:25,708
 Boss, please don't misunderstand me.

1604
02:02:26,208 --> 02:02:30,166
Nowadays, I can't differentiate between right and wrong.

1605
02:02:30,666 --> 02:02:33,416
 You have made me aware.

1606
02:02:33,916 --> 02:02:37,041
I will never step in this house again.

1607
02:02:37,541 --> 02:02:41,041
Another relation is broken. - Boss!

1608
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:54,875
 Rani! Oh God!

1609
02:02:55,375 --> 02:02:58,875
Uncle! Give me water. - I'll get it right now.

1610
02:03:06,291 --> 02:03:09,875
What's wrong, dear? - Such days have arrived, uncle.

1611
02:03:10,375 --> 02:03:12,625
Today, Pratima told me why I went to her house?

1612
02:03:13,125 --> 02:03:15,125
 Pratima said this!?

1613
02:03:15,625 --> 02:03:20,625
Yes, uncle, I could've never thought she'll utter such words.

1614
02:03:21,125 --> 02:03:23,041
 I will never go there.

1615
02:03:23,541 --> 02:03:25,583
The circumstances are not in my favor.

1616
02:03:26,083 --> 02:03:28,166
I won't stay here a minute anymore, uncle.

1617
02:03:28,666 --> 02:03:32,458
 You pack the luggage immediately.

1618
02:03:32,958 --> 02:03:36,833
Boss! Rani is seriously injured due to the fall.

1619
02:03:37,333 --> 02:03:38,625
 You please come immediately.

1620
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:40,916
 No. I will never step in that house.

1621
02:03:41,416 --> 02:03:43,541
 She is lying unconscious.

1622
02:03:44,041 --> 02:03:47,541
Munni has become unconscious? - Yes.

1623
02:03:51,916 --> 02:03:56,250
The thing which I leave once, I never turn back and look at it.

1624
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:57,500
 I will not go to that house.

1625
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:01,166
Oh God! Now who will save my daughter?

1626
02:04:01,666 --> 02:04:03,708
 Where will I run with her all alone?

1627
02:04:04,208 --> 02:04:07,708
Where has Chandar gone? - He must be at the club.

1628
02:04:38,541 --> 02:04:42,041
 Mummy! Uncle..

1629
02:04:47,666 --> 02:04:50,250
First I thought it is an ordinary wound.

1630
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:52,791
Now I've come to know that she has received a..

1631
02:04:53,291 --> 02:04:55,916
..serious injury on the delicate part of the brain.

1632
02:04:56,416 --> 02:04:58,541
 Perhaps some vein has burst.

1633
02:04:59,041 --> 02:05:02,541
 It is impossible to operate her.

1634
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:14,000
Stop it, Chandar. Come home immediately.

1635
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:17,250
Munni has received serious injury. She is lying unconscious.

1636
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:24,333
She is lying unconscious? Rani is very fortunate, boss.

1637
02:06:24,833 --> 02:06:29,500
I'm in my senses, in spite of being drunk.

1638
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,500
 Come with me.

1639
02:06:40,375 --> 02:06:41,708
 What's wrong, Chandar?

1640
02:06:42,208 --> 02:06:44,166
 Yes? What happened?

1641
02:06:44,666 --> 02:06:47,916
You were such a good man, so sincere.

1642
02:06:48,416 --> 02:06:51,916
What after all is that thing which made you a drunkard?

1643
02:06:55,666 --> 02:07:00,708
Do you think I drink wine for my happiness, boss?

1644
02:07:01,208 --> 02:07:04,583
 I drink to forget my sorrows.

1645
02:07:05,083 --> 02:07:10,000
You know I was a hard working and a simple man.

1646
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:12,458
You have brought me to this stage, boss! You!

1647
02:07:12,958 --> 02:07:15,166
What are you saying? - I am right.

1648
02:07:15,666 --> 02:07:17,625
 You have become a pauper by..

1649
02:07:18,125 --> 02:07:20,791
..distributing wealth and alms to this world.

1650
02:07:21,291 --> 02:07:25,833
I've become a very big man accepting wealth from this world.

1651
02:07:26,333 --> 02:07:30,041
Because of this wealth, today, between you and me..

1652
02:07:30,541 --> 02:07:35,000
..between me and my wife, there is a lot of hatred, boss.

1653
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:38,916
Boss, take my entire wealth. Take back Lakshmi Mansion.

1654
02:07:39,416 --> 02:07:43,958
And hire me again as an employee and a servant.

1655
02:07:44,458 --> 02:07:48,250
I was very happy during those days, boss. I was very happy.

1656
02:07:48,750 --> 02:07:51,916
 Chandar!

1657
02:07:52,416 --> 02:07:58,250
Boss, I don't want anything. I just want peace.

1658
02:07:58,750 --> 02:08:00,583
 I just want peace.

1659
02:08:01,083 --> 02:08:04,333
I have understood, Chandar. I've understood everything.

1660
02:08:04,833 --> 02:08:07,750
You don't worry. Everything will be all right.

1661
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:12,375
Come home first. One gets peace of heart at home.

1662
02:08:12,875 --> 02:08:17,875
 With your wife and kids.

1663
02:08:18,375 --> 02:08:21,875
 Come.

1664
02:08:26,291 --> 02:08:31,708
Doctor, how is Rani? - Sorry, I was unable to save her.

1665
02:08:32,208 --> 02:08:35,708
 Boss!

1666
02:08:39,333 --> 02:08:43,750
 'Munni, you have also left me?'

1667
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:49,583
Boss, Rani uttered only your name till she breathed her last.

1668
02:08:50,083 --> 02:08:53,583
 Come and see Rani's face.

1669
02:08:57,541 --> 02:09:00,416
You won't step in this house even now?

1670
02:09:00,916 --> 02:09:04,416
Won't you kiss Rani's cold forehead? - No.

1671
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:11,250
I just want to remember Munni's smiling face.

1672
02:09:14,833 --> 02:09:21,791
 Rani, my daughter!

1673
02:09:22,291 --> 02:09:31,958
"Which has rains, beloved and swings too."

1674
02:09:32,458 --> 02:09:42,000
"Which has rains, beloved and swings too."

1675
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:52,166
"I wonder where there is such a fair in this world."

1676
02:09:52,666 --> 02:10:02,333
"I wonder where there is such a fair in this world."

1677
02:10:02,833 --> 02:10:12,000
"The entire world seems a death tomb to me."

1678
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:22,333
"O' life, now I am afraid of your name."

1679
02:10:22,833 --> 02:10:26,333
"O' life, now I am afraid of your name."

1680
02:10:43,541 --> 02:10:47,041
 'Munni!'

1681
02:10:52,333 --> 02:10:59,541
Dear Rajju, the dead ones never return. Keep patience.

1682
02:11:00,041 --> 02:11:04,541
I know you won't like to stay at Lakshmi Mansion.

1683
02:11:05,041 --> 02:11:09,083
You won't be able to stay there, dear.

1684
02:11:09,583 --> 02:11:13,250
 Rajju, please listen to me.

1685
02:11:13,750 --> 02:11:17,166
Many years back, you had got a hut built for me.

1686
02:11:17,666 --> 02:11:21,708
 Let us go and stay there.

1687
02:11:22,208 --> 02:11:26,875
 I know you won't stay for free.

1688
02:11:27,375 --> 02:11:32,541
Dear, do one thing. Give me some rent every month.

1689
02:11:33,041 --> 02:11:36,541
Yes. I'll definitely give. - Let's go, dear.

1690
02:11:50,708 --> 02:11:57,500
Uncle Dinu, these are my ancestors' tombstones.

1691
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,500
 Munni is also buried here.

1692
02:12:10,750 --> 02:12:15,375
Sir! - Yes?

1693
02:12:15,875 --> 02:12:17,125
 Postman. Come.

1694
02:12:17,625 --> 02:12:20,125
Sir, are you Mr. Rajan? - Yes, why?

1695
02:12:20,625 --> 02:12:28,000
Sir, there is a parcel for you. Please sign here.

1696
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:33,833
Sir, I got your address with great difficulty.

1697
02:12:34,333 --> 02:12:39,666
Okay, sir! - Wait a minute. Here.

1698
02:12:40,166 --> 02:12:43,000
Thank you, sir. Greetings. - Greetings!

1699
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:47,000
 Uncle Dinu!

1700
02:13:44,875 --> 02:13:48,375
 'A doll!?'

1701
02:13:52,166 --> 02:13:56,375
'Uncle Dinu, remind me while going to office today.'

1702
02:13:56,875 --> 02:13:59,500
'I'll order a musical doll for my Munni from Japan.'

1703
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,458
'What is that, uncle? - Dear, that is a very beautiful doll.'

1704
02:14:03,958 --> 02:14:07,458
 'It sings even.'

1705
02:14:13,625 --> 02:14:16,541
What happened, Rajju? Are you all right, dear?

1706
02:14:17,041 --> 02:14:20,541
 Rajju.

1707
02:14:36,083 --> 02:14:39,583
 Rajju, you take it inside.

1708
02:15:30,625 --> 02:15:34,125
Uncle Dinu. - Yes, Rajju?

1709
02:15:38,958 --> 02:15:43,791
Here, keep it carefully. - What does it contain, dear?

1710
02:15:44,291 --> 02:15:48,208
It contains my letter. Read it later.

1711
02:15:48,708 --> 02:15:52,208
And do as I have written in the letter. - Okay, dear.

1712
02:16:21,166 --> 02:16:28,041
Boss! - Oh! Pratima!? Come. Sit.

1713
02:16:28,541 --> 02:16:32,041
 You please don't take trouble.

1714
02:16:36,250 --> 02:16:40,250
How are you? - I am fine.

1715
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:43,750
Uncle Dinu. - What's the matter, dear?

1716
02:16:44,250 --> 02:16:49,791
Come and see who has come. - Oh! Dear Pratima?

1717
02:16:50,291 --> 02:16:53,375
Dear, are you all right? - Yes, uncle Dinu, I am fine.

1718
02:16:53,875 --> 02:16:55,333
 But boss's health seem unwell..

1719
02:16:55,833 --> 02:16:59,166
Pratima, I'm very happy for you have come here.

1720
02:16:59,666 --> 02:17:01,208
Many days had passed since I saw you.

1721
02:17:01,708 --> 02:17:03,750
 The days pass somehow.

1722
02:17:04,250 --> 02:17:07,083
Well, forget it. First tell me, what will you have?

1723
02:17:07,583 --> 02:17:11,083
 Whatever I eat is given by you only.

1724
02:17:11,583 --> 02:17:15,416
 Forget about morning and evening.

1725
02:17:15,916 --> 02:17:17,208
Right now, you are a guest in this house.

1726
02:17:17,708 --> 02:17:22,583
A guest? Yes, I am a guest after all.

1727
02:17:23,083 --> 02:17:24,666
 To tell the truth, I'm very hungry.

1728
02:17:25,166 --> 02:17:26,500
 I won't leave without eating food.

1729
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,708
 Now that's like a good girl.

1730
02:17:29,208 --> 02:17:32,250
Uncle Dinu, go and cook a luscious lunch for Pratima.

1731
02:17:32,750 --> 02:17:34,916
Rajju.. - What's wrong? Go now.

1732
02:17:35,416 --> 02:17:38,583
Please come here. I want to tell you something.

1733
02:17:39,083 --> 02:17:42,583
 I'll be right back.

1734
02:17:47,208 --> 02:17:48,166
 What's the matter, uncle Dinu?

1735
02:17:48,666 --> 02:17:51,041
 Dear, you invited her to eat food..

1736
02:17:51,541 --> 02:17:53,708
..but there is no food-grain in the house.

1737
02:17:54,208 --> 02:17:58,416
Not only that, perhaps, there are no spices even.

1738
02:17:58,916 --> 02:18:06,333
I've always given to the world, am I defeated today?

1739
02:18:06,833 --> 02:18:11,000
 Uncle Dinu!

1740
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:15,000
Rajju! - Yes, uncle. Go immediately.

1741
02:18:27,916 --> 02:18:31,166
Pratima, how did you come here today?

1742
02:18:31,666 --> 02:18:34,916
Beggar always comes to the master's place to take something.

1743
02:18:35,416 --> 02:18:38,708
I needed something. So I've come to take it.

1744
02:18:39,208 --> 02:18:40,375
 From me?

1745
02:18:40,875 --> 02:18:43,583
Whatever I've taken, I've taken it from you.

1746
02:18:44,083 --> 02:18:46,750
 You have never refused me.

1747
02:18:47,250 --> 02:18:50,166
 And you won't refuse today either.

1748
02:18:50,666 --> 02:18:52,541
Dear Rajju. - Yes, please come.

1749
02:18:53,041 --> 02:18:54,208
 You eat food, I'll be right back.

1750
02:18:54,708 --> 02:18:58,208
 Come, dear.

1751
02:19:10,666 --> 02:19:15,916
'O God, Pratima has come to ask something from me.'

1752
02:19:16,416 --> 02:19:22,208
'What if she asks something which I'm unable to give?'

1753
02:19:22,708 --> 02:19:26,208
 'Please help me.'

1754
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:32,500
Perhaps, the pickle is very hot. Dear, drink water.

1755
02:19:46,041 --> 02:19:49,166
 Pratima, how did you like the food?

1756
02:19:49,666 --> 02:19:53,208
 God's offering is always good.

1757
02:19:53,708 --> 02:19:59,208
 Yes. Now tell me, what did you need?

1758
02:19:59,708 --> 02:20:03,541
 Boss, Rani is no more alive.

1759
02:20:04,041 --> 02:20:10,083
Pratima, don't remind me of Munni and relive my memories.

1760
02:20:10,583 --> 02:20:13,208
Even Munna is not keeping well for past few days.

1761
02:20:13,708 --> 02:20:16,041
 His fever doesn't recede.

1762
02:20:16,541 --> 02:20:18,208
 He doesn't feel hungry or thirsty.

1763
02:20:18,708 --> 02:20:20,458
 He just keeps murmuring.

1764
02:20:20,958 --> 02:20:22,333
 What do the doctors say?

1765
02:20:22,833 --> 02:20:26,666
 Does Chandar takes care of him?

1766
02:20:27,166 --> 02:20:34,166
 Well.. what do you want from me?

1767
02:20:34,666 --> 02:20:36,041
 You must remember.

1768
02:20:36,541 --> 02:20:39,708
You had gifted a golden pigeon on our wedding. - Yes.

1769
02:20:40,208 --> 02:20:42,750
 Munna used to play with that pigeon.

1770
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:45,916
When Rani was alive, she had taken Munna..

1771
02:20:46,416 --> 02:20:49,875
..in your courtyard to play with your real pigeon.

1772
02:20:50,375 --> 02:20:53,166
Now Munna is lying unconscious and insisting on it.

1773
02:20:53,666 --> 02:20:58,541
'I want uncle's pigeon. I want the real pigeon.'

1774
02:20:59,041 --> 02:21:03,041
Even the doctor says that if he gets the real pigeon..

1775
02:21:03,541 --> 02:21:05,458
 ..Munna will recover completely.

1776
02:21:05,958 --> 02:21:09,458
 Pigeon?

1777
02:21:11,875 --> 02:21:17,791
'O God! You have snatched away everything from me one by one.'

1778
02:21:18,291 --> 02:21:20,875
 'Everything was given by you.'

1779
02:21:21,375 --> 02:21:26,166
'Whoever asked for help from me till now, I never refused.'

1780
02:21:26,666 --> 02:21:30,083
'Today, I will have to refuse Pratima.'

1781
02:21:30,583 --> 02:21:33,541
'Take me away from this world before I do that.'

1782
02:21:34,041 --> 02:21:35,958
 'Give me death, O' God!'

1783
02:21:36,458 --> 02:21:39,083
'You have given me a magnificent life.'

1784
02:21:39,583 --> 02:21:40,791
 'Give me a magnificent death too!'

1785
02:21:41,291 --> 02:21:43,541
 What happened, boss?

1786
02:21:44,041 --> 02:21:46,000
 Uncle Dinu, why did boss go away?

1787
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:50,041
 Dear, you won't understand.

1788
02:21:50,541 --> 02:21:52,958
You have asked such a thing from Mr. Rajan..

1789
02:21:53,458 --> 02:21:55,000
..which he can't give you at any cost.

1790
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:57,250
 I've just asked for a pigeon..

1791
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:59,041
..because Munna wants to play with it.

1792
02:21:59,541 --> 02:22:02,166
Dear, you don't know. When you came here..

1793
02:22:02,666 --> 02:22:08,541
 ..Mr. Rajan asked you to eat food.

1794
02:22:09,041 --> 02:22:14,083
He didn't know there is no food at home.

1795
02:22:14,583 --> 02:22:18,916
He whispered to me, 'Go to the market, sell the pigeon..

1796
02:22:19,416 --> 02:22:22,083
 ..and bring food for Pratima.'

1797
02:22:22,583 --> 02:22:25,833
Uncle Dinu! - That pigeon is already sold.

1798
02:22:26,333 --> 02:22:33,500
Dear, such a great man was destined to see such a day!?

1799
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,083
Till today, I had a lot of faith in God.

1800
02:22:37,583 --> 02:22:43,583
Dear, now I've lost faith in God! I've lost faith in Him.

1801
02:22:44,083 --> 02:22:45,250
 What happened?

1802
02:22:45,750 --> 02:22:46,666
 What happened, dear Rajju?

1803
02:22:47,166 --> 02:22:51,125
 Get up! Rajju!

1804
02:22:51,625 --> 02:22:53,125
Rajju! - Boss?

1805
02:22:53,625 --> 02:22:55,208
 Rajju!

1806
02:22:55,708 --> 02:22:58,916
 Uncle Dinu! What happened to boss!?

1807
02:22:59,416 --> 02:23:00,916
 Boss? Uncle Dinu!

1808
02:23:01,416 --> 02:23:04,500
 Dear, see God's injustice.

1809
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:11,625
He snatched away such a splendid man so soon!

1810
02:23:12,125 --> 02:23:13,875
 Dear Rajju!

1811
02:23:14,375 --> 02:23:18,625
Boss? Pratima, what happened to boss?

1812
02:23:19,125 --> 02:23:22,625
 He is no more.

1813
02:23:26,250 --> 02:23:29,750
 Boss!

1814
02:23:32,208 --> 02:23:35,500
Pratima, his hand is not straight while dying.

1815
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:40,041
It seems he is still giving something to someone.

1816
02:23:40,541 --> 02:23:47,416
Boss never accepted any help from me till he was alive.

1817
02:23:47,916 --> 02:23:51,666
I will meet all the expenses of his funeral rites.

1818
02:23:52,166 --> 02:23:55,000
I will meet all the expenses, Pratima.

1819
02:23:55,500 --> 02:24:00,500
No, Chandar, your wish can't be fulfilled.

1820
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:06,125
 Read my son Rajan's letter.

1821
02:24:06,625 --> 02:24:09,500
 'I can see that my end is near.'

1822
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,750
'I've never asked anything from anyone all my life.'

1823
02:24:13,250 --> 02:24:15,333
 'I won't ask even after my death.'

1824
02:24:15,833 --> 02:24:19,083
'I had some money left after selling the silver plate.'

1825
02:24:19,583 --> 02:24:21,208
 'I am leaving that behind.'

1826
02:24:21,708 --> 02:24:25,000
'Perform my funeral rites only with that money.'

1827
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:27,750
'No one has the right in this world to add even..

1828
02:24:28,250 --> 02:24:31,166
..one stick in my funeral pyre with his money.'

1829
02:24:31,666 --> 02:24:35,500
'My second wish is, my funeral pyre..

1830
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:39,583
..should be burned by Munni's side. Rajan!'
