1
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:02,472
"How cool are we."

2
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,940
"How..."

3
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,614
"How... How... How cool are we."

4
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,546
"How cool are we."

5
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,604
"How... How... How cool are we."

6
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,512
"How cool are we."

7
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,308
"We don't stop anyone
who comes willingly."

8
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,970
"Nor do we try to stop
anyone from leaving."

9
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:48,480
"O Baby, our style's
completely different."

10
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,342
"No Incidents occur."

11
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,073
"We can't floor any girls either."

12
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:55,444
"Our stars are in
a bad constellation."

13
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,077
"Your love's driven my crazy."

14
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,770
"I was numb before, but now I am hot."

15
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,007
"My mom wanted a handsome boy."

16
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,671
"But we're mom and dad's mistake."

17
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:14,646
"How cool are we."

18
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:18,010
"How cool are we."

19
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,511
"How...cool are we."

20
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,044
"How..."

21
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:35,171
"How... How... How cool are we."

22
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,010
"How cool are we."

23
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:42,344
"How cool are we."

24
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,070
"We're the best."

25
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:49,546
"How cool are we."

26
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:53,080
"We're the best."

27
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:54,969
'How cool are we.'

28
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,444
'Rocky'

29
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,511
'Rocky'

30
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:57,237
"Check him out Check
him out...it's Rocky."

31
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,543
"Check him out Check
him out...he's funky."

32
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,951
"Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!"

33
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,009
'This is Rocky.'

34
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,774
'When the world sleeps...'

35
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,244
'...well, he doesn't,
nor does he let the girls sleep.'

36
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:16,673
'Right now he's standing here...'

37
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,111
'...but his friend Kanhaiyya
is standing somewhere else.'

38
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:29,048
O Lord Krishna,
I don't want a two-minute noodle...

39
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,810
...but someone who
can give me eternal love.

40
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,677
I'm not looking for TP, but 'BP'...

41
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,370
'Beautiful Patni' (Wife).

42
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:40,080
Hear my prayers O
Prabhu...O Deva (God.)

43
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,541
Mister, currently Maggie
and BP can be banned any minute.

44
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:52,305
Even Rajnikanth can't
help you on this.

45
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:53,277
All the best.

46
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:59,310
Yesterday I met a man...Mr. Popat.

47
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,342
He deals in girls.

48
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:05,812
Popat's going to introduce
me to a beautiful girl.

49
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,246
I've an idea to make
a macho impression on him.

50
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,808
<i>Mr. Baig.</i>

51
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,243
<i>popat.!</i>

52
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:27,346
Hello, Mr. Baig. - Mr. Popat, welcome.

53
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:28,468
I was waiting for you.

54
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,804
Where is the stuff, show me!

55
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:34,282
Mr. Baig,
I've bought the best stuff for you.

56
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,945
Once you see it, you'll pounce on it.

57
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,679
What a big variety...I must say.

58
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:42,213
We've got Russian,
American, Italian...

59
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,371
...and even the local stuff.

60
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:50,247
But Mr. Popat,
you said your business is 'Supplying'.

61
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:51,878
Yes, I did. And in laundry supplies...

62
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:57,246
...you also get traditional attire,
kurta...and more.

63
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:00,107
You said you wanted a suit,
so I brought you a suit.

64
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,238
Look. - Bloody cheat.

65
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,237
You awakened my dormant desires.

66
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:07,044
I will bury you alive.

67
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,274
<i>Old man...now I
understand your demand.</i>

68
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,707
Bloody pervert.

69
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,870
Pervert...
- Who are you calling pervert?

70
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,305
It's been so long since
I asked for a coffee.

71
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,170
Who's is this? - It's fresh.

72
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,143
Give it to me.

73
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,441
Hello. Hi.

74
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,378
Good morning, sir.

75
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:37,644
'There was Mr. India who could
be seen only through red color.'

76
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,411
'And there's Kanhaiyya, who
goes cockeyed whenever he sees red.'

77
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,943
'No matter which color
of red he sees...'

78
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,871
'...original or dyed,
it makes him cock-eyed.'

79
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,277
Focus. Focus. Focus.

80
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,204
Good morning. Good morning.

81
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:12,180
May I...come...in, sir?
- Yes, come in.

82
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:24,681
Sir sent me to you.

83
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,879
So that I can take it...

84
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:27,911
Your..

85
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,301
..Notation?

86
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,277
Oh, I see.

87
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,837
So...how are you going
to take the notation?

88
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:37,679
However you want to give it.

89
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,072
I mean...notation.

90
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:44,546
I'll give it verbally.

91
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,341
But I'll hold it in
my hands and then take it.

92
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,937
What? - Your cell...phone.

93
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,841
Phone. - Give it to me.

94
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,942
Kanhaiyya, the delegates are here.

95
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,140
Bring the presentation to
the conference room in five minutes.

96
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:57,841
Okay, dad. Okay.

97
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,677
Kanhaiyya, focus. Focus.

98
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,904
Focus, Kanhaiyya.

99
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,769
We have only five minutes.

100
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:04,909
Come on, baby.

101
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,411
I don't want to do this.

102
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,447
I am looking for true love.

103
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,002
True love. Move aside.

104
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,512
I'll give you true love.

105
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,237
Kanhaiyya. Don't leave me and go.

106
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,074
Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen.

107
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:22,342
Our company,
Lawman pg3 has only one motto.

108
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:23,743
'Excellence

109
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,872
The talent of making
jeans runs in our genes.

110
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:31,210
And my son, Kanhaiyya Lele...

111
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,346
...is assisting me in it.

112
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,444
So Ladies and Gentlemen,
tie your seat-belts...

113
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:38,878
...and be ready for
a fantastic presentation...

114
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:42,879
...of Sanskar...Range
of traditional wear!

115
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,809
These photographs will
give you all a clear image...

116
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,511
...of how we can make
a backdoor entry in the market.

117
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,304
To capture this virgin market.
- How did this happen?

118
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,672
...is our goal.

119
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:01,881
This next image will show
you the steps we've taken...

120
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,937
...to escape the booby
traps of the market.

121
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,775
These traps... - What's coming here?

122
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,971
What is all this?

123
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:10,846
Did you do something?
- I didn't do anything.

124
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,878
Silence please.

125
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:14,573
What is this, Mr. Lele? Look behind.

126
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,008
Kanhaiyya!

127
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,971
Is my picture printed in the Lokmat.
- Shut up, Rocky.

128
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,779
Everything went haywire today.

129
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,377
Dad's very angry.

130
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,136
My dear cock-eyed Kanhaiyya.

131
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,678
Focus! Focus!

132
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,609
Even he knows what happens
when his dear son sees red.

133
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,612
The problem is your cockeyed.

134
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:52,339
How long can he stay angry?

135
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:54,806
Tonight, when your granny turns 69...

136
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:56,278
...you can convince him. - Yes.

137
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,675
Only granny's 69th
birthday can save me now.

138
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:02,948
I wish that you and aunty
stay happy together forever.

139
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,880
Kanhaiyya,
you should start calling me mom now.

140
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,708
Aunty's are as good as moms.

141
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,914
I know I didn't raise you.

142
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:14,010
But after sister passed away...

143
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,376
...I did change your soiled pants too.

144
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,342
Yes.

145
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,778
No need to pamper this useless fool.

146
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:21,341
I told you to get the cake.

147
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,208
Didn't I?

148
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,404
Rocky's bringing it.

149
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,273
Everybody, the cake's here.

150
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,774
Come, come. - Everybody come.

151
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:28,911
No, no, not you.

152
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,310
Granny, come.

153
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,074
My 69th birthday cake! - Yes.

154
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:37,046
One...two...three!

155
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,043
Isn't it just perfect?

156
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,270
Isn't that good? Isn't that good?

157
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:42,468
<i>no, no, no, no.</i>

158
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,375
What's this?

159
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,970
I gave you two a small job...

160
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,004
...but you couldn't do that either,
you fools.

161
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:49,703
But uncle,
what's wrong with this cake?

162
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,178
What are you saying?

163
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,305
Look...

164
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:59,446
It's granny's birthday,
not Shakti Kapoor's.

165
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,540
Now we'll have to do this job.

166
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:07,671
Me and your mom will have to go...

167
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,507
...and get a decent cake.

168
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,376
Until then you take
granny to the temple.

169
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:12,878
Okay, fine. - Come on.

170
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:14,637
You couldn't even get a decent cake...

171
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,176
...at least you could've
brought a decent gift.

172
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:18,304
Gift? Where will I get a gift now?

173
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,471
There's Passmyorder.com..

174
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,437
Shopping plus saving. - Yes.

175
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,707
It was so nice, so big.

176
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:27,771
Granny...tonight when you turn 69...

177
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,211
...we'll give you a bigger surprise.
- Really?

178
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,802
Let's go to the temple now. - Okay.

179
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,410
This website's amazing.

180
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,005
Done.

181
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:45,812
Gift shopping's done. What now?

182
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,240
"Rocky."

183
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,238
No one's at home.

184
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:53,705
Let's give my thing some overhaul...

185
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,635
...so that it functions
properly when needed.

186
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,175
Desi Pop Corn.

187
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,670
Hot version of Bollywood films.

188
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,834
This seems new.

189
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,844
<i>'Hag Rambo hag'
(Wake up Rambo Wake up}.</i>

190
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:14,310
'Rocky'

191
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:21,280
"Run Rambo Rum."

192
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,808
See, doctor.

193
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:25,736
Rambo's always running.

194
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,674
And no matter how hard I try...

195
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,207
...it doesn't wake-up.

196
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,636
Please do something.

197
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,105
Otherwise my youth will go to waste.

198
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:39,346
Rambo will wake-up, that's my promise.

199
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:42,443
Formula 36.. 24..36

200
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,946
Wake up Rambo! Wake up!

201
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:49,935
Come on, Rambo.

202
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,173
Oh no. Now there's
just one cure for it.

203
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,710
Nurse Laura.

204
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,277
Yes, Dr.
Waghmare. - Come in, nurse Laura.

205
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:03,903
How can I help you?

206
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,373
This man has...two
low parkinson's disease.

207
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:11,234
Cure him!

208
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,537
Give it to me.

209
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,010
Push it.

210
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,104
Give it to me.

211
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,709
"Wake up...Rambo."

212
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:36,703
I am awakened.

213
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:39,004
"Wake up...Rambo."

214
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:40,507
Oh my god

215
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,311
Come, granny.

216
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,410
Rocky!

217
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:12,844
What's this?

218
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,875
Rocky, what have you done?

219
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,642
You killed granny on her birthday.

220
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,939
Rocky!

221
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:31,971
Your father shouldn't have chucked
you out for such a small thing.

222
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,808
After all...you're a
cannonball from his cannon.

223
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,848
If you hadn't shot from
your cannon and killed granny...

224
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,308
...then I wouldn't have been orphaned.

225
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,813
Let's just forget what happened.

226
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,671
I was with you that day,
and I still am.

227
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,508
Shoulder to shoulder!

228
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:50,272
It takes only a second, a minute
or an hour for bad times to change.

229
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:52,742
See...the phone's ringing.

230
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:54,972
Hello.

231
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,270
After all these years.

232
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,334
It's Mickey from Thailand.

233
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,845
Mickey. - Yes.

234
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,411
No, buddy...we're in a bad condition.

235
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:04,307
What?

236
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,608
<i>Really?</i>

237
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:06,911
What are you saying?

238
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,001
Of course.

239
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,080
Done, bro. Done. Thanks.

240
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,404
What happened? What did Mickey say?

241
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,845
He said that our
fate's going to change.

242
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,512
He's offered us a job.

243
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,604
He wants us to go to Bangkok...

244
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,203
...and give him a hand job. - What?

245
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,504
I mean...give him a hand in his job.

246
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,509
Help him out.

247
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,701
I see. - Yes.

248
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:28,035
What job?
- He didn't say that.

249
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,711
But he said his business
is 'Give and Take'.

250
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,046
'Give and Take?' - Yes.

251
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,746
Rocky, I hope we don't
get stuck in a mess.

252
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,670
Whatever it is,
I am sure it's better than this.

253
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:40,373
Yes. - Instead of rotting
in Madh Island, let's go to Thailand.

254
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,271
And Mickey's guaranteed...

255
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,574
...that we'll make
loads of money out there.

256
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:47,803
Bathe in champagne.

257
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,910
Moe. - Moe.

258
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,443
And he also said...

259
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,209
...we'll ride with girls in a big car.

260
00:17:55,367 --> 00:18:00,043
"Youth's ruined me."

261
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,739
"Youth's ruined me."

262
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:28,039
"Youth's ruined me."

263
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:32,775
"Youth's ruined me."

264
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:37,407
"Youth's ruined me."

265
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:42,382
"Youth's ruined me."

266
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:47,038
"My eyes get fixed on anyone I see."

267
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:51,309
"Day and night I'm worried
about finding a new boy toy."

268
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:54,678
"It's not hard to find a lover boy."

269
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:58,377
"It's not hard to find a lover boy.

270
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:00,640
"I want to taste your beauty."

271
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:05,307
"Youth's ruined me."

272
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:09,975
"Youth's ruined me."

273
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:14,607
"Youth's ruined me."

274
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,240
"Youth's ruined me."

275
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,406
"Your beauty."

276
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,238
"O my beauty."

277
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,278
"Hello."

278
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,471
"Madam, now listen to this."

279
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,047
"You just turned 18,
and you youth's like a bud."

280
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,444
"I am your man, be my queen."

281
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:35,704
"You do as you please."

282
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,940
"I guess this is heridetary."

283
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,310
"Who are you waiting for?"

284
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,540
"I know darling,
you want to lock eyes with me."

285
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,045
"But you never admit."

286
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:47,909
"Why do you beautify yourself?"

287
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,843
"Your beauty's hi fi,
and I'm a naughty boy."

288
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:54,072
"And we're going to enjoy all night."

289
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,443
"Wearing my Lawman,
I am good looking."

290
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:58,843
"Let's get surrender to each other."

291
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,440
"Zoom in with your eyes,
and wander around."

292
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,074
"Don't stare at my
waist with your eyes."

293
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:12,513
"It's the heart's dirty thinking."

294
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,078
"It's the heart's dirty thinking."

295
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:17,306
"But listen to your heart
if you want to have fun."

296
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:22,043
"Youth's ruined me."

297

"Youth's ruined me."

300
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,070
"O Madam. your youth."

301
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,146
"O Madam. So crazy."

302
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,435
"O Madam."

303
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:52,173
"Looking at your beauty
I want to quench my thirst."

304
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:56,807
"Not just a drop,
I want to drink the entire bottle."

305
00:20:56,933 --> 00:21:01,507
"You're my Romeo,
I'm your Juliet take me in your arms."

306

"Youth's ruined me."

313
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,135
Excuse me.

314
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,312
Yes. - My seat's there.

315
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,976
Can I? - Yeah, yeah, of course.

316
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:05,611
Sorry.

317
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:10,273
Excuse me.

318
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,010
I think that's my seat over there.

319
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:13,812
Yeah, yeah...sure.

320
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,243
Pillow please. - Pillow please.

321
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,136
Here's your pillow ma'am. - Thank you.

322
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,175
Excuse me,
can I also have a pillow please!

323
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:34,273
Thank you. - Welcome.

324
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:40,238
Thailand, here we land!

325
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,010
What's that?

326
00:22:57,533 --> 00:23:00,946
'Welcome to Suvana Bhoomi
International Airport.'

327
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,284
"How cool we are, how cool we are."

328
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:21,442
"How cool we are, how cool we are."

329
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,876
Rocky, Mickey said 8 o'clock, right?

330
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,241
"Bad boy."

331
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,741
"Bad boy."

332
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:42,536
What the...

333
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:47,741
Brother, so nice to see you.

334
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,508
Looking nice. - Great.

335
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,477
Looks like you two shaped up.

336
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:54,308
You two have changed a lot. - You too.

337
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,404
Chain...leather...biceps.

338
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:59,913
My entire life has changed.

339
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:02,138
Let me show you how. - Okay.

340
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:05,248
You've ruined my life, Rajjo.
- I love you so much.

341
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,608
And you doubt me.

342
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,208
Shut up! What kind of love is this?

343
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,835
What the...

344
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,573
I will slap you.
Shut up. - You can try.

345
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,475
I am a Punjabi too. - Shut up.

346
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,240
Brother. - Yes, brother.

347
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,307
What's going on?

348
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,173
We've been married
for only three months...

349
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:18,769
...and she already
gave birth to a child.

350
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:20,011
What? - Right.

351
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,770
How long have you been married?
- Three months.

352
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:23,971
And you? - Three months.

353
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:25,944
And when was the kid born?
- Three months.

354
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,535
Total.

355
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,578
Total...

356
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:31,904
Total... 3+3+3...

357
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:35,105
Rajjo, that's nine months.

358
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,111
Time just flew by, forgive me.

359
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,873
You suspect me for no reason.
- Sir, thank you.

360
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:41,675
You just saved my marriage. - Yes.

361
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,471
6609823... call me.

362
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:46,639
Come on,
let's plan for the second one.

363
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:49,179
I am really proud of you today.

364
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,346
Even though you stayed
out of our country for so long...

365
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,013
...but you haven't
forgotten our culture yet.

366
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:57,178
You'll be blessed.

367
00:24:57,733 --> 00:24:59,735
You just saved a marriage
from breaking-up.

368
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,102
He hasn't changed at all.

369
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:04,773
He's still the same.

370
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,972
Buddy, I didn't do some good deed.

371
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:09,841
I did this for my own benefit.

372
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,208
You didn't get it?

373
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:13,605
He'll never understand.

374
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,374
Come on, son.

375
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:23,642
Welcome to the new exciting life.
- Thank you.

376
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,076
But tell me something,
what do you exactly do...

377
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,611
...and what do you want us to do.

378
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,311
Yes. - It's a surprise.

379
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:31,772
A surprise that will
change your lives.

380
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:35,376
Just like Sunny Leone's
changed after she came to India.

381
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,311
Kaushaliya baby.

382
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,643
Darling meet me tonight,
I'll make you big star.

383
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,145
Mickey, you've an amazing life.

384
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:15,144
This was just the trailer.

385
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,711
The door to heaven open from here.

386
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:20,403
Welcome.

387
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,302
This is my studio. - Nice place.

388
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:23,807
And I do all my work from here.

389
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,240
What work? - Everything.

390
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:26,575
You'll find out.

391
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:29,175
You guys are going
to have a lot of fun.

392
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:31,009
Lot of fun!

393
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:35,582
"Now that you've pinched me..."

394
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:40,412
Today I am going to
teach you three things.

395
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,334
Entertainment.

396
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:44,707
Entertainment.

397
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,437
Entertainment.

398
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,276
Me first.

399
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:51,878
Me first.

400
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,413
Don't make a noise,
or I'll punish you.

401
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,041
Cut...got the shot. Moving on.

402
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,168
Hey, Merili.

403
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:02,474
Hi, Mickey! - Meet my friends,
Kanhaiyya and Rocky.

404
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:05,477
And this is my heroine...Merili.

405
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:10,142
It's a...real pleasure...meeting you.

406
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,975
Did you see my shot? - Yes, we did.

407
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,640
Superb shot. - Was it fun?

408
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,678
Why is she talking like that?
- No, no.

409
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,075
Don't be scared.
She's very good actress.

410
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,144
Method actress.

411
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:25,735
She's been doing the
same role for three years.

412
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,345
She's so into her character...

413
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,241
...that now it's difficult
to come out. Right, Merili?

414
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:30,345
Yes.

415
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:31,504
Madam is ready.

416
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:35,738
Meenamma...this is
my new encyclopedia.

417
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,473
H for... - Harder.

418
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:39,070
F for... - Faster.

419
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:41,375
L for.. - Longer.

420
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:45,769
Focus! Focus! Focus!

421
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,240
No, Meenamma. No.

422
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:52,514
You've jumbled up all
the meanings in the dictionary.

423
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,840
I love it.

424
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:55,678
It's your fault.

425
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:59,039
Where did you buy
such a stupid dictionary

426
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,206
I think I've seen her before.

427
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:04,777
Give it to me push it.

428
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,478
Nurse Laura.

429
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:09,810
I didn't know that
such big incidents...

430
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:13,747
...happen in such big cities.

431
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:17,507
Don't underestimate
the power of common man.

432
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:22,607
"Lungi Dance."

433
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:25,612
"Lungi Dance."

434
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,503
Yeah!

435
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:30,014
"Lungi Dance."

436
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:30,677
Cut.

437
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:31,677
Hey, Mickey.

438
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:33,440
What a shot, Tarzan.

439
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:35,438
Darling.

440
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:38,241
Hi, Mickey! - How are you, Saku?

441
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,472
What a hot shot?

442
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:40,910
Meet my friends.

443
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,171
This is Kanhaiyya and Rocky.

444
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:44,538
Sakuntala.

445
00:28:44,734 --> 00:28:46,042
You mean Shakuntala.

446
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:47,739
No, no, she's Sakuntala.

447
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,379
Her pronouncitation are off.

448
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,877
She pronounces S as Sh.

449
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:51,935
She's Saku.

450
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,536
But calls herself Shaku.

451
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,945
Thank God she doesn't
say Sh instead of F..

452
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,603
F...

453
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:02,938
Is she alright?
- No, she isn't alright at all.

454
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,201
When she gets in the mood...

455
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,070
...she starts touching herself.

456
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:09,114
Madam's in the mood.
Someone take he shot.

457
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:12,370
I am coming, - Go, go, go, on.

458
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:14,344
Come there.
- But...what's going on here.

459
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:20,213
You two are doing really great, guys.

460
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,278
Hi!

461
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:22,812
Hey, who are these two?

462
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:25,414
They are my childhood friends.
Kanhaiyya and Rocky.

463
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,479
And guys,
they are my brilliant actors.

464
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,241
Wow! They are so cute.

465
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,278
Especially this one. - Get lost!

466
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:34,477
Don't tease him too much.

467
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:36,774
He's fresh stuff...I
specially imported him.

468
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:38,404
Hold on.

469
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:40,774
Are you going to replace us with them?

470
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:43,539
My beauty, don't cry.

471
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,040
I am not going to replace you.

472
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:47,746
There's still lot
of light in your lamp.

473
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:49,002
That's true.

474
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:50,373
These two are here to...

475
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:53,972
...fill my and Saku's life
with light from their candle.

476
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,076
Candle?

477
00:29:58,633 --> 00:29:59,907
How could you imagine...

478
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:02,036
...that we'll say
yes to such a vile idea.

479
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,247
I thought you two are
tired of doing good things.

480
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,845
Now you'll do some bad things.

481
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,842
Aren't you ashamed? You make BP.

482
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:11,741
Not BP...DP. - DP?

483
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,335
Yeah...Dirty Picture.

484
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:16,079
Tell me something,
why do you want us to do this.

485
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:17,544
What's so special about us?

486
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,040
Darling, you two have that...
- X factor.

487
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,170
No! Max Factor.

488
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,179
You two might have forgotten...

489
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,207
...but I can never forget that day.

490
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:30,338
Remember that pool
party on my birthday.

491
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:45,435
How's that crow standing on water?

492
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:57,572
God blesses people with a big heart,
or big brains.

493
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:00,145
But use your brains...and
question your heart.

494
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:01,803
What did God bless you two with?

495
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:03,275
What are you two staring at?

496
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,409
I admit I make dirty picture.

497
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:07,474
I make boys and girls
strip off their clothes.

498
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,212
But I use that money...

499
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,304
...to provide clothes
for the children of Somalia.

500
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:14,311
You see all the wrong things I do.

501
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:16,269
But you're ignoring the fact...

502
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,912
...that I give jobs
to poor Indians everyday.

503
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,539
You two can think whatever
you want about me.

504
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:25,179
But in my view, I don't make porn...

505
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,778
...I do a good deed.

506
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:29,407
He's right.

507
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,310
And anyway,
Kanhaiyya, we don't have a choice.

508
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:33,744
We cannot go back home.

509
00:31:34,134 --> 00:31:35,738
If we want to do
something big in life...

510
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,040
...then we must do this.

511
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:40,174
We both posses a special talent...

512
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,371
...conferred on us by God.

513
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:42,907
We shouldn't waste it.

514
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,375
Have you lost your mind, Rocky?

515
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,771
You can go ahead
and do this if you want.

516
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,708
But not me.

517
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,612
Since childhood,
we did everything together.

518
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:54,280
We lived together...boozed together.

519
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:57,471
We swung together...and
even shagged together.

520
00:31:58,034 --> 00:31:59,445
Are you going to leave me alone now?

521
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:02,503
Look around you.

522
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,746
You'll definitely
see a sign indicating..

523
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,207
...that we should sign Mickey's film.

524
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:07,836
Yes...

525
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,537
Look at that flower, that's a sign.

526
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,737
What sign?

527
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,370
Focus, Kanhaiyya, focus!

528
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:25,439
Look, Kanhaiyya.

529
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:29,071
The clouds are giving
you a sign and blessing you.

530
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,009
Say yes, Kanhaiyya. Say yes.

531
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,903
Say yes, Kanhaiyya.

532
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,206
Say yes.

533
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,003
Yes.

534
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,738
You can do it. - Yes.

535
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:40,073
Say yes.

536
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:41,940
Yes. - Say yes, Kanhaiyya.

537
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:42,943
Yes.

538
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:48,940
Set ready? Light ready?

539
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,240
Switch on the projector.

540
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,208
Chinki clap.

541
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,808
'Kholay' shot 1, take 1.

542
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:53,809
Action!

543
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:58,177
I am tired of driving my cart alone.

544
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:00,379
I thought Chiru will drive it for me.

545
00:33:00,434 --> 00:33:03,142
But he left me and ran
away with that tall guy.

546
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:05,242
It's worth a thought...

547
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:07,314
They were just friends at first.

548
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,140
But now...they're
more than just friends.

549
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,635
What do I do?

550
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:13,336
What do I do?

551
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:20,577
Kasanti.
How about I solve your problem?

552
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,077
How, Faakur sir. You don't have hands.

553
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:27,438
Stop shoving that thing in my mouth.
Point it there.

554
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:29,475
Chabbar!

555
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:34,672
For miles and miles away...

556
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:36,935
...on the eve of Holi.

557
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:38,646
Every mother says...

558
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:40,610
"Go to sleep dear."

559
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:45,841
"Or else Chabbar will
come here with his water-gun."

560
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,244
"When is Holi?"

561
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:50,012
"When is Holi?"

562
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:54,011
Kasanti. How many were they?

563
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,635
I don't know.

564
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,577
I can't count beyond 50.

565
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:02,137
Kasanti,
don't play Holi with this dog.

566
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,615
Okay, Faakur.
Let's toss for Kasanti. - No.

567
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:11,137
You toss. Do it. - No.

568
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:12,304
No!

569
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:13,643
No!

570
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:15,273
No!

571
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:19,168
Faakur sir.

572
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:22,079
Your hands...and you're holding guns.

573
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:23,538
Yes!

574
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:24,742
"When is Holi?"

575
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,471
"When is Holi?"

576
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:26,477
It's right now.

577
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,610
Cur!

578
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,578
Fantastic! Pack up!

579
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,203
Hello sir.

580
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:35,539
Two ice-creams, please.

581
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,602
Cone, please.

582
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,878
Thank you.

583
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:46,473
"Love is God's boon.
Love is a festival of the heart."

584
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:47,239
Here you go.

585
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,608
No!

586
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,979
"Love is like the dawn."

587
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:57,641
First eat the ice-cream
and then eat her.

588
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:58,474
I mean watch her.

589
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,137
Here.. - You're just...

590
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:05,210
Listen. I'll be back
from the bathroom.

591
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,380
Listen, don't go anywhere.
Stay right here.

592
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,535
Fine, I heard. I'll stay right here.

593
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,874
I'll be back from the bathroom. - Go.

594
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,874
"My love for you selfless."

595
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:31,282
"My love's selfless."

596
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:38,978
"My love for you selfless."

597
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:42,208
"My love's selfless."

598
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:04,937
No, no, no...

599
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:13,942
Disgusting.

600
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:16,773
What are you doing?

601
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,707
There's a mouse in my pant. - Mouse?

602
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,942
In your pant.

603
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:22,839
Stop laughing.

604
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,540
I wonder where she went.

605
00:36:36,734 --> 00:36:39,214
Rocky...it's love at first sight.

606
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:40,268
Who? The mouse?

607
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,811
No, that girl.

608
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:44,471
But...I wonder what she
might be thinking about me.

609
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:47,344
She must be thinking that
you like playing like kids.

610
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:49,945
And maybe if she likes
playing with kids...

611
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,105
...then you've found your true love.

612
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:52,907
Shut up.

613
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,703
Stop trying to turn this U-rated
love story into an A-rated one.

614
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:58,608
Not every girl is a sex-object. - Yes.

615
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,081
Even I have a dream,
that I have a perfect wife.

616
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:04,377
And I can settle down with her.

617
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,274
Perfect wife. - Yeah.

618
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:06,677
In Bangkok,
you'll definitely find her.

619
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:07,404
Let's go find her.

620
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,808
But let's go for the
shooting before that.

621
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:09,811
Mickey's waiting for us.

622
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:11,776
Come on. True love!

623
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:15,211
'Ek Milan' Scene 1, Shot 1, Take 1.

624
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,715
Until we don't empathize
with someone's pain...

625
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:22,472
...we don't separate from our pain.

626
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:25,673
Come and give me
that sweet pain, Guru.

627
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,675
I am coming.

628
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,074
I am in you lane.

629
00:37:28,134 --> 00:37:30,341
Lift. Lift. Lift.

630
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,275
Who are you? - Who is it, Ayesha?

631
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:42,940
Whoever he is, don't start without me.

632
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,613
Okay. Come soon.

633
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:48,677
Lift. Lift. Lift.

634
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,504
Wow. Screw-driver.

635
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:03,681
Don't worry...I won't
give you a chance to complain.

636
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,047
Hey villain...then let's do it.

637
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:09,942
Cut!

638
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:11,505
Fantastic.

639
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:22,405
I am so sorry.

640
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:31,047
Oh no!

641
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:46,611
Scene 1, shot 1, take 1.

642
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:56,941
"It's Friday night...I need a kiss."

643
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,810
"May Allah save me from you."

644
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,503
You're so good, Devil.

645
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,810
Last night, I kept thinking about you.

646
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,573
Don't think too much about me.

647
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,178
I only come by day, not night.

648
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,803
Life is worthless...when there's no..

649
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:17,811
'Lick'.

650
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,437
Sometimes the Devil's under you...

651
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:22,940
“sometimes you're under the Devil.

652
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:25,068
Too much fun!

653
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,712
Till then do whatever
you want to, man.

654
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:03,007
"First floor always complains."

655
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,412
"I think my neighbors
will get fed up of me."

656
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:16,043
"First floor always complains."

657
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,445
"I think my neighbors
will get fed up of me."

658
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,743
"My friends are dancing."

659
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,371
"I hope I don’t pick
a fight with my neighbors."

660
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:29,074
"Because tonight's a house-party."

661
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:32,171
"Because tonight's a house-party."

662
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:35,508
"Because tonight's a house-party."

663
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,604
"Because tonight's a house-party."

664
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,139
"Open the bottles,
wash your face with booze."

665
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:49,711
"Look all you want."

666
00:40:50,034 --> 00:40:51,536
"But don't say a word."

667
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:54,979
"Don't drink too much,
or you'll get a hangover."

668
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:58,214
"Then you'll ask me to drop you home."

669
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,509
"Let's have fun, nothing to fear."

670
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,739
"This is my home."

671
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:07,607
"The walls are shaking."

672
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:11,240
"Because the girl
next door's peeking in."

673
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:33,477
"The light's all dim."

674
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:36,247
"And it's a romantic night."

675
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,374
"The light's all dim.
"And it's a romantic night."

676
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:43,607
"Everyone's watching only us."

677
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,876
"I don't know, what's your fault."

678
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:49,914
"I've no clue, what's wrong or right."

679
00:41:50,067 --> 00:41:52,946
"I'm writing a saga
about my restless heart."

680
00:41:53,267 --> 00:41:56,510
"I want to party today,
because its a Sunday."

681
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:59,480
"So do it...So do it...So do it..."

682
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:03,107
"Because tonight's a house-party."

683
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,306
"Because tonight's a house-party."

684
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:09,607
"Because tonight's a house-party."

685
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,772
"Because tonight's a house-party."

686
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:16,110
"Because tonight's a house-party."

687
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:19,307
"Because tonight's a house-party."

688
00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:22,540
"It's a party-party-party.
tonight's a house-party."

689
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,740
"Because tonight's a house-party."

690
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,906
"It's a party-party-party.
tonight's a house-party."

691
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:32,241
"Because tonight's a house-party."

692
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,438
"Because tonight's a house-party."

693
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:39,004
"Because tonight's a house-party."

694
00:43:12,867 --> 00:43:14,039
oh, my God!

695
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,072
Stop!

696
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,337
Go back, or you'll die.

697
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,338
Stop. - Stop.

698
00:43:37,334 --> 00:43:38,404
Oh, God!

699
00:43:45,967 --> 00:43:46,809
Stupid.

700
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,111
But I didn't do anything.

701
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,478
Poor guy.

702
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:56,375
No!

703
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,437
Hi. - Hi.

704
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:01,247
You didn't fall
intentionally on that girl.

705
00:44:01,434 --> 00:44:03,004
Yet she slapped you.

706
00:44:03,234 --> 00:44:04,713
That's my luck.

707
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,041
That day,
when I was eating ice-cream...

708
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,046
...a mouse got into my pant.

709
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:12,178
But until I got it out,
you were already gone.

710
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,573
I am so sorry.

711
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:15,804
Then you misunderstood
me in the lift as well.

712
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,711
I am really, really sorry.

713
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,207
I thought you're Shakti Kapoor...

714
00:44:20,734 --> 00:44:22,577
...but you turned about
to be Tusshar Kapoor.

715
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:23,612
It's okay.

716
00:44:24,034 --> 00:44:26,537
Everyone thinks my
dad's Shakti Kapoor too.

717
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:28,640
I am Shalu.

718
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:31,036
So how can I makeup with you.

719
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,904
You can make-out with me. - What?

720
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,911
I mean...you can go out with me.

721
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,774
Oh...

722
00:44:35,934 --> 00:44:38,141
Coffee or dinner, whatever suits you?

723
00:44:38,534 --> 00:44:39,945
Can we go out on a date?

724
00:44:40,267 --> 00:44:42,110
Never delay a good plan.

725
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,779
Of course I'll go on a date.

726
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,002
Scene 1, shot 1, take 1.

727
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:51,338
Action.

728
00:45:09,267 --> 00:45:10,610
Bro, I am nervous.

729
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,307
Kanhaiyya, focus. Focus.

730
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:20,079
Come on. Do something.

731
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:21,271
Focus!

732
00:45:21,334 --> 00:45:22,278
Focus!

733
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:24,302
Focus!

734
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:30,873
Even I am suddenly feeling
performance pressure.

735
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:33,244
Do one thing, take this.

736
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:35,738
This? What's this?

737
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:36,742
Stay on?

738
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,040
Yes.

739
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:40,806
After you take
this...you'll stay on...

740
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,243
...and on...and on!

741
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:51,710
O naive tormentor...come home...

742
00:45:54,267 --> 00:45:57,680
O naive tormentor...come home...

743
00:45:58,167 --> 00:45:59,441
...come home...

744
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,046
Stop pointing that thing on me.
Point it there.

745
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,042
"Change my luck"

746
00:46:23,234 --> 00:46:27,944
"Change my luck"

747
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:33,410
Cut it!

748
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:36,172
Fantastic!

749
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,847
You guys were amazing.

750
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,806
Shalu, I...

751
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,306
Yes.

752
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:31,844
Will you be the mother of my kids?

753
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:34,575
What?

754
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,370
<i>I mean...</i>

755
00:47:36,734 --> 00:47:37,769
Will you marry me?

756
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:44,412
If your answer's yes...

757
00:47:44,567 --> 00:47:47,138
...then please accept
this valuable gift.

758
00:47:48,934 --> 00:47:50,811
Lucera. Wow!

759
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:52,578
Lucera diamond!

760
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:56,007
Lucera's diamonds are quite big.

761
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,447
And you said your family's rich.

762
00:48:01,734 --> 00:48:03,645
Then why such a small diamond?

763
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,377
My mother always said...

764
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:09,078
"Son, when a girl's
impressed by small things..."

765
00:48:09,867 --> 00:48:13,610
"...later she's really
happy to see bigger things."

766
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:17,810
Big or small,
I want everything you have.

767
00:48:18,534 --> 00:48:20,480
Of course I will marry you.

768
00:48:27,934 --> 00:48:28,844
Action!

769
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,006
Come here.

770
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,372
Come on.

771
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:34,478
Bloody fools, oafs.

772
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,080
Blow it on those two, not me.

773
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,971
How about me?
- No, you don't blow anything.

774
00:48:40,134 --> 00:48:41,044
Just go and stand there.

775
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:42,679
You baldy,
where do you get these guys?

776
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,240
Come on, one more.

777
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,074
Action!

778
00:48:45,134 --> 00:48:50,516
"The body shivers...heart quivers."

779
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:54,907
"When he comes... Pingum."

780
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:05,274
Bloody baldy...you
fool...zoom on them.

781
00:49:05,334 --> 00:49:06,005
Who are you?

782
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,410
One with the biggest chewing gum...

783
00:49:08,734 --> 00:49:12,614
He can only be...Dajirao Tingum.

784
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,405
And you?

785
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:16,273
His sequel. Tingum Returns.

786
00:49:16,434 --> 00:49:17,538
Returns!

787
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,806
Returns!

788
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:22,940
<i>Hey...</i>

789
00:49:36,134 --> 00:49:42,050
I am coming!

790
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,407
Now mine's...dangling.

791
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:53,813
Excellent shot!

792
00:49:55,234 --> 00:49:56,269
Very nice.

793
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,111
I'll make the next film with you two.

794
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,110
London Dreams.

795
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:00,538
Brilliant.

796
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:02,268
Done, bro.

797
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:05,209
What's wrong with him?

798
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,704
Hello. - Hi.

799
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,402
Shalu, hold on.

800
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:12,241
Shalu's phone. Keep quiet.

801
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,446
Yes, Shalu.

802
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:18,677
What are you doing?

803
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:21,808
I was watching television.

804
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,844
I see...but I don't
hear the television.

805
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,876
Television... I've put it on mute.

806
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,344
I was changing the channel. - I see.

807
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,905
Are you worried about your obesity?

808
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,374
Don't give up.

809
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,071
Even I was over-weight.

810
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,544
But now...I've lost weight.

811
00:50:42,634 --> 00:50:43,544
See...

812
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,277
Crispy potatoes.

813
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,141
Crispy potatoes.

814
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,747
Crispy potatoes.

815
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:54,709
Don loves wild cats.

816
00:50:54,934 --> 00:50:56,777
Wild and juicy.

817
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:00,010
"Baby doll made of gold."

818
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:02,408
"Baby doll made of gold."

819
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:06,176
Wow...there are many
exciting things on TV today.

820
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,506
Yes...the television's
really nice today.

821
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,271
Okay...I called to tell
you something important.

822
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,880
Lower the volume. - Yes...

823
00:51:15,934 --> 00:51:17,845
"Baby doll made of gold."

824
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,714
Kanhaiyya,
I talked to my dad about our marriage.

825
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:26,480
And he now wants to meet your family.

826
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:27,270
What?

827
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,980
But my family isn't here right now.

828
00:51:30,267 --> 00:51:31,644
Then call them.

829
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:34,073
You said that you will manage.

830
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:39,612
Look, my dad is believes
in culture and family.

831
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,071
Until he doesn't meet your family...

832
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:43,871
...and know them better...

833
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,306
...he won't agree to our marriage.

834
00:51:47,434 --> 00:51:53,248
After that...you can
ask father for my hand.

835
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,439
Why just your hand...I
want all of Shalu.

836
00:51:58,633 --> 00:52:02,513
By the way, I knew about culture,
family, values...

837
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:04,804
...but I didn't know
your father will be...

838
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:07,245
...straight out of
Suraj Barjatiya films.

839
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,380
Yes, you got it right.

840
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:12,776
But my father's Karjatiya
and not Barjatiya.

841
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,502
Surya Karjatiya.

842
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,440
Karjatiya?

843
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:17,042
Yes.

844
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,544
When does he want to meet my family?

845
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,202
This weekend, on Saturday.

846
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:22,172
Bye.

847
00:52:24,534 --> 00:52:25,376
Saturday.

848
00:52:25,634 --> 00:52:27,079
Why did you tell her that you're rich?

849
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,311
And your family will
cross the seven seas for you.

850
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,204
Don't you remember...

851
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:32,838
...no one intervened
when you were thrown out.

852
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,705
What did you expect me to say?

853
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:35,844
That my father kicked me out.

854
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:38,113
And now I am acting in porn films.

855
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:41,576
Yes, I don't like to lie.

856
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,946
But this time I lied for my love.

857
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:45,375
What will you do with your love...

858
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:47,105
...when your lie's exposed?

859
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:49,814
You'll get <i>sc***</i> trying
to get your family.

860
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:51,037
Where will get your family?

861
00:52:55,567 --> 00:52:57,843
Kanhaiyya, you can have a family.

862
00:52:58,067 --> 00:52:59,637
But you must plan for that.

863
00:53:00,234 --> 00:53:02,544
Family planning. - What? Are you mad?

864
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:13,340
Mickey, are you crazy?

865
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,007
You mean your actors...

866
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,876
...will pretend to be my family?

867
00:53:17,267 --> 00:53:19,213
Forget it,
I'll think of a different option.

868
00:53:19,334 --> 00:53:20,642
You don't get it.

869
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:22,244
Come here. Come here.

870
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:23,036
Look.

871
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:24,738
Look at them carefully.

872
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:33,102
What did you say?

873
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:35,238
No, no, this is bulls***
It won't happen.

874
00:53:35,334 --> 00:53:36,540
Don't listen to him.

875
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,412
Look at them carefully.
- No. This won't happened.

876
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:41,678
Let him visualize.

877
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:54,079
"Sister, your crazy brother-in-law."

878
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:58,046
"Flirts around with girls."

879
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,535
Yes, you're right.

880
00:53:59,633 --> 00:54:01,306
It's a brilliant idea. - Yes!

881
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:02,641
Yeah!

882
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,543
I think it's brilliant too.

883
00:54:04,634 --> 00:54:06,409
You won't find such pious bonds.

884
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,274
What say Kanhaiyaa?

885
00:54:07,634 --> 00:54:10,513
Sucku and Merili will
be my sisters. - What?

886
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,474
Sisters.

887
00:54:12,467 --> 00:54:14,413
And these two will
be my brothers-in-law.

888
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,310
Hold on. Who will play
the role of your father?

889
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:22,838
What?

890
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,943
I am still young. No!

891
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,980
You'll be perfect.
- Shut up. What perfect.

892
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:28,635
If we're caught, we'll be jailed.

893
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,609
And I am too handsome to be in jail.

894
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,407
If I drop the soap in the shower...

895
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:34,811
...I won't be able to face anyone.

896
00:54:34,867 --> 00:54:36,278
To hell with you two...I
am going. - Rocky.

897
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:37,335
You and your family drama.

898
00:54:37,434 --> 00:54:38,412
Rocky, listen. - It'll be brilliant.

899
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,508
Who will play the
role of your father now?

900
00:54:45,334 --> 00:54:46,574
How mean, Kanhaiyya?

901
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:48,408
Do I look as old as your father?

902
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,480
You just have to pretend as my father.

903
00:54:51,967 --> 00:54:52,775
Done.

904
00:54:52,967 --> 00:54:54,344
I can do anything for you.

905
00:54:54,433 --> 00:54:56,811
Thanks. - Someday I'll
have to be someone's father.

906
00:54:57,167 --> 00:54:58,578
I'll begin with you. - Yes.

907
00:54:58,867 --> 00:55:00,540
Bless you, son. - Get lost.

908
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:02,576
Listen. This won't be easy.

909
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,743
They are all cheap actors,
and not theatre artists.

910
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,779
We'll need to train them.
- Yeah, you're right.

911
00:55:08,067 --> 00:55:09,944
But I'll direct this film.

912
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,808
Done. - Done.

913
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,242
We can do it.

914
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,601
Action.

915
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:18,616
Karjatiya...if you don't
let your daughter marry my son.

916
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:20,442
I will shoot you.

917
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,638
What are you blabbering?

918
00:55:22,034 --> 00:55:25,140
Son, I love you from my heart.

919
00:55:25,334 --> 00:55:27,280
Mickey, heart's on the left side.

920
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:29,143
I keep shaking all day...

921
00:55:29,267 --> 00:55:30,974
...so my heart keeps
moving left and right too.

922
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,306
And this is nothing.

923
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,209
Yesterday my kidney
slipped down to my foot.

924
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:36,244
I had to pee from my toe.

925
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:40,644
Look Sucku,
from today I am your small brother.

926
00:55:41,467 --> 00:55:43,572
Small brother! - Behave yourself.

927
00:55:43,767 --> 00:55:47,374
You've to pretend as my sister
in front of Karjatiya family.

928
00:55:47,434 --> 00:55:48,208
Okay.

929
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:50,174
Yes, sister. Okay.

930
00:55:50,234 --> 00:55:52,441
Come on, now go and wear some clothes.

931
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:56,512
More clothes? - Sucku, please go.

932
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,204
Come on, go.

933
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,945
What are you wearing?

934
00:56:02,267 --> 00:56:04,679
Sari. Why? Am I not looking nice?

935
00:56:04,734 --> 00:56:05,838
Why are you wearing it like that?

936
00:56:06,034 --> 00:56:09,846
"The buds and stars, they all say."

937
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:14,106
"I've never worn
so many clothes before."

938
00:56:14,334 --> 00:56:15,472
Yes, fine.

939
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:17,613
But whatever you're wearing,
please wear it properly.

940
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,373
Okay. Now, go.

941
00:56:19,533 --> 00:56:21,103
Hello. - Hello.

942
00:56:22,034 --> 00:56:23,035
What do you do?

943
00:56:23,134 --> 00:56:24,841
Our business is Give and Take.

944
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,640
Sometimes we take...

945
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:28,179
...and sometimes we happily give.

946
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,074
Oh my, God.

947
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:32,078
My marriage lies in your hands.

948
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:34,040
Please don't ruin it. - Okay.

949
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,444
Go and practice for
your role properly.

950
00:56:36,734 --> 00:56:37,542
Go.

951
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:40,340
I don't know what's going
to happen about my marriage.

952
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:43,269
Tradition, Honor and discipline.

953
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:45,172
These are the three
rules of Gurukul...

954
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,574
...which I can't follow myself.

955
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:47,805
So why would I tell
my son to follow it.

956
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,141
I know, I'll tweet your marriage.

957
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,702
Shalu weds Kanhaiyya.

958
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,810
Mickey, stop joking around.

959
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,237
You haven't prepared
for the role of my father yet.

960
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,404
Don't worry,
all I have to do is put on a wig.

961
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,772
I'll be an ideal father...

962
00:57:01,867 --> 00:57:03,369
...and Shalu's father
will be surprised.

963
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:11,944
Hello, Karjatiya uncle.

964
00:57:12,033 --> 00:57:15,446
Would you like some tea...or biscuits?

965
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,071
No, no, no, no, Merili, stop.

966
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:20,608
You will only offer tea
to my future father-in-law.

967
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:21,407
Nothing more.

968
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,207
And no showing any skin.

969
00:57:23,267 --> 00:57:24,439
Come on, repeat your lines properly.

970
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,138
Hello, Mr. Karjatiya.

971
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,077
What would you like to have? - Good.

972
00:57:28,567 --> 00:57:29,739
What would you like? - Look, Sucku.

973
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,878
Be serious guys.

974
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:33,106
If you do anything wrong...

975
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,712
...then I'll get divorced
before getting married. - So sad.

976
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,774
Don't stare, take my blessings.

977
00:57:40,967 --> 00:57:41,809
Greetings. - Bless you son.

978
00:57:41,934 --> 00:57:42,435
What?

979
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:44,604
Kanwarlal. Oh, sorry.

980
00:57:44,967 --> 00:57:45,968
Karjatiya.

981
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,272
You'll have to let
your daughter marry my son.

982
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:51,813
One day this boy will bring
Ekta (Unity) in this world.

983
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:53,469
"I am a traveller, friends."

984
00:57:53,567 --> 00:57:55,069
"I've no home or place to stay."

985
00:57:55,234 --> 00:57:56,542
"I've to keep walking."

986
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:57,743
Ekta.

987
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:14,746
"So cool are we."

988
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,044
Not like this.

989
00:58:21,133 --> 00:58:22,009
Wear it properly.

990
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:22,976
Like this. Properly.

991
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,745
Keep your veils in place...

992
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,643
...in front of my
future father-in-law.

993
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,778
Yeah, okay.

994
00:58:28,034 --> 00:58:28,876
Okay.

995
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,739
And yes, repeat your names once again.

996
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,574
Chu...Chusil... I mean Sushil.

997
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,841
Sanskaar. - Yeah.

998
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,004
Sakshi

999
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:40,845
<i>Sunder.</i>

1000
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,038
Remember them, don't forget.

1001
00:58:44,134 --> 00:58:45,636
Where the hell's Mickey.

1002
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,735
Feels like he has arrived.

1003
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,642
All the best.

1004
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,111
Come on, guys. We can do this.

1005
00:58:54,633 --> 00:58:56,306
Hello. Please come in.

1006
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:57,172
Hello.

1007
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:03,206
Kanhaiyya, this is my father.

1008
00:59:04,967 --> 00:59:07,106
And he is? - Shalu's father.

1009
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:09,347
No, no, I was talking
about your parrot.

1010
00:59:10,734 --> 00:59:11,644
Oh...

1011
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:15,643
If you're talking about
the parrot then look at him...

1012
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,904
...why are you looking at me?

1013
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:18,637
My name's Prem.

1014
00:59:18,934 --> 00:59:21,915
Father, Kanhaiyya has a problem.

1015
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:24,244
Whenever he sees the color red...

1016
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,543
...his eyes become talking
China looking Tokyo.

1017
00:59:27,767 --> 00:59:30,179
Kanhaiyya, focus. Focus. Focus.

1018
00:59:34,667 --> 00:59:35,907
Where's the rest of my family.

1019
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:38,104
They'll come later. - Okay.

1020
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,175
Please come in. - Yes.

1021
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:44,568
Come in.

1022
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:46,508
Come.

1023
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,871
Greetings, father. - Bless you.

1024
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,070
Come, sit.

1025
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:57,743
No, I can't do that. I can't sit.

1026
00:59:57,834 --> 00:59:59,871
Why? - Father has a problem.

1027
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:02,272
Due to an injury to the spinal cord...

1028
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:04,938
...he can't sit or sleep.

1029
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,809
That's why I always keep standing.

1030
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:09,208
And my parrot also
keeps standing with me.

1031
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:10,337
Right, Prem?

1032
01:00:11,033 --> 01:00:11,841
Prem.

1033
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,511
His name's Prem.

1034
01:00:13,967 --> 01:00:15,139
Prem Karjatiya.

1035
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,644
Your parrot's quite big. - Yes.

1036
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,740
When I was small, so was he.

1037
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:24,980
As I grew big, so did my Prem.

1038
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,705
And my late wife
loved Prem more than me.

1039
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,811
Is this your family? - Yes.

1040
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,177
This is my sister, Sanskar. - Hello.

1041
01:00:35,234 --> 01:00:37,475
And that's her husband Sushil. - Wow.

1042
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:41,307
Sanskar, Sushil...really nice names.

1043
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,843
Very traditional.

1044
01:00:43,534 --> 01:00:45,480
What do you do, Sanskar?

1045
01:00:45,834 --> 01:00:47,245
Well, I give...

1046
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,335
What do you give?

1047
01:00:48,434 --> 01:00:50,675
Education to poor kids.

1048
01:00:51,734 --> 01:00:54,681
Inspiration to widows. - How nice.

1049
01:00:55,267 --> 01:00:57,178
And to bachelors...

1050
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,274
Besan (Flour).

1051
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,210
They deal in gram flour.

1052
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,870
Sweet meat, flour...

1053
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:08,508
He's a master in
everything that's besan.

1054
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,874
Oh, I see.

1055
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,975
Even I love 'Besan'.

1056
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,104
You should let me try
your 'Besan' some day too.

1057
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,335
Of course.

1058
01:01:17,067 --> 01:01:18,876
Whenever you feel like...

1059
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:25,649
...I will...fulfil your desire.

1060
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,780
Why she breathing so heavily?

1061
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:29,935
Asthama.

1062
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:33,611
Sometimes my wife
gets asthama attacks.

1063
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,710
Kanhaiyya,
why is she scratching herself?

1064
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,673
Well, she's my other sister Sucku.

1065
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:42,111
I mean Sakshi.

1066
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,339
And sometimes she gets an allergy.

1067
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:45,970
And that's why she
starts scratching herself.

1068
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,636
Don't worry about her.

1069
01:01:47,934 --> 01:01:49,140
She'll get better.

1070
01:01:50,233 --> 01:01:51,735
And who's this young man?

1071
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:53,378
This is her husband, Sunder.

1072
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:55,106
Hello. - I see...

1073
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:59,043
Does he do the same business
as your other brother-in-law?

1074
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,442
Yes.

1075
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,774
You got it right.

1076
01:02:01,867 --> 01:02:05,178
We lend each other a
hand in the family business.

1077
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,801
Wow.

1078
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,040
I love the family that works together,
eats together...

1079
01:02:10,134 --> 01:02:11,135
...and sleeps together.

1080
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:15,740
Prem...don't worry.

1081
01:02:15,867 --> 01:02:17,107
He's just laughing.

1082
01:02:19,634 --> 01:02:21,910
Where the hell is Mickey?
- Where's who?

1083
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,001
I was just saying...

1084
01:02:23,067 --> 01:02:26,605
...I am so glad to meet you.
- Me too, son.

1085
01:02:26,734 --> 01:02:29,476
But I don't see your parents around.

1086
01:02:29,634 --> 01:02:31,875
Well...

1087
01:02:32,434 --> 01:02:34,471
Son, here I am.

1088
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:40,542
He's here.

1089
01:02:54,034 --> 01:02:54,910
Shake it Daddy.

1090
01:02:55,967 --> 01:02:57,071
You are... - Pop.

1091
01:02:58,034 --> 01:02:59,274
Kanhaiyya's father.

1092
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:02,780
I see. I am really
glad to meet you. - I see.

1093
01:03:02,834 --> 01:03:04,108
Glad to meet you.

1094
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,902
Even my parrots happy to meet you.

1095
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,306
Wow, your parrot's quite big.

1096
01:03:07,433 --> 01:03:09,435
Greetings, uncle.
- No, no, darling. Come here.

1097
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,741
I was waiting for this day.

1098
01:03:12,267 --> 01:03:13,405
She is very soft.

1099
01:03:13,633 --> 01:03:15,544
What are you doing?

1100
01:03:15,634 --> 01:03:17,614
Don't hit on your
future sister-in-law?

1101
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:19,110
If you hadn't shown up...

1102
01:03:19,167 --> 01:03:20,669
...and you would've definitely
arrived for my final rites.

1103
01:03:22,334 --> 01:03:24,007
Wow! Nice! Very nice!

1104
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:27,843
Look at the budding father-son love.

1105
01:03:28,467 --> 01:03:30,640
And they're so sweetly
whispering in each others ears.

1106
01:03:30,834 --> 01:03:32,643
That's Sanskar (Values).

1107
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,781
Did you...call me?

1108
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:37,039
No, sister.

1109
01:03:37,267 --> 01:03:39,713
He was talking about
'Sanskar' in general, not you.

1110
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:42,178
By the way, Kanhaiyya...

1111
01:03:42,233 --> 01:03:44,042
...I haven't seen your mother yet.

1112
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,044
Mother?

1113
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,738
Mother? - Mother.

1114
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:48,837
Mother.

1115
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,907
We don't know where's her mother.

1116
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:57,210
It's a long story. - Yes.

1117
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,136
Long...very long.

1118
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,704
Son! - Who's that?

1119
01:04:03,867 --> 01:04:04,868
I am here.

1120
01:04:07,734 --> 01:04:08,610
Rocky!

1121
01:04:09,434 --> 01:04:10,708
"Rocky. . Rocky"

1122
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,072
"Rocky. . Rocky"

1123
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,575
Kanhaiyya, let's run away.

1124
01:04:25,467 --> 01:04:29,005
Who are you?
- I am Kanhaiyya's father.

1125
01:04:29,567 --> 01:04:31,046
Oh, God! Another father.

1126
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,177
Daddy?

1127
01:04:34,967 --> 01:04:36,503
You're his father, he is his father...

1128
01:04:36,633 --> 01:04:37,941
...so many fathers.

1129
01:04:39,367 --> 01:04:44,180
I am the father...that
gave birth to him.

1130
01:04:45,034 --> 01:04:48,914
And he's the father
who raised him. - Yes.

1131
01:04:48,967 --> 01:04:51,413
That's why he considers
us both his father.

1132
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:52,940
And not just us...

1133
01:04:53,033 --> 01:04:56,105
...he considers all the
men in this world his father.

1134
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,410
Daddy!

1135
01:04:57,667 --> 01:04:58,645
Wow! - Wow!

1136
01:04:58,734 --> 01:05:00,680
Your son has such great ideals.

1137
01:05:00,933 --> 01:05:02,879
If everyone thinks like your son...

1138
01:05:03,134 --> 01:05:05,273
...then everyone in the world
will treat each other as siblings.

1139
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,073
But, tell me something.

1140
01:05:07,467 --> 01:05:09,970
Sanskar and Kanhaiyya
look like brother and sister.

1141
01:05:10,134 --> 01:05:12,410
But she doesn't look
like your daughter.

1142
01:05:14,267 --> 01:05:15,075
Her...

1143
01:05:15,233 --> 01:05:18,544
We adopted her when
she was very small.

1144
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:21,336
Who's my...

1145
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:22,973
Daddy.

1146
01:05:23,467 --> 01:05:25,777
Children will always remain children.

1147
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,007
You should take rest, I am very tired.

1148
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:33,080
What? - I mean you must be tired,
because of the long journey.

1149
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:35,008
Sakshi. Go show them the bedroom.

1150
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:35,940
Bedroom?

1151
01:05:36,467 --> 01:05:39,778
Anytime. It's my favourite place.

1152
01:05:39,967 --> 01:05:41,207
Actually,
please don't show them anything.

1153
01:05:41,367 --> 01:05:42,607
I think he's getting another attack.

1154
01:05:43,067 --> 01:05:45,069
Brother-in-law, you show them the way.

1155
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,042
Yes, let's go.

1156
01:05:46,134 --> 01:05:46,942
Yes, of course.

1157
01:05:47,033 --> 01:05:48,910
Come, I'll show you your bedroom.

1158
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,001
They're gone now.

1159
01:05:50,067 --> 01:05:52,138
Pathetic actress...
you're going out of character.

1160
01:05:52,434 --> 01:05:53,640
Lock her in the bathroom.

1161
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,338
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1162
01:05:56,267 --> 01:05:57,302
Where did you come from?

1163
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,140
I am your friend.
How could I leave you dangling?

1164
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:03,074
Who is it now?

1165
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,142
I'll go take a look.

1166
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:10,968
Why are you going inside?

1167
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:14,514
Who are you?
- What language are they speaking?

1168
01:06:18,234 --> 01:06:20,737
Look, madam.
I think you're in the wrong film.

1169
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,206
Everything already quite fishy here.

1170
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:29,670
"I am saying that
I am at the right place."

1171
01:06:35,734 --> 01:06:39,272
"I'm aunt Sindoor,
Karjatiya's widow sister."

1172
01:06:39,334 --> 01:06:41,314
Oh, hello. Hello.

1173
01:06:41,367 --> 01:06:42,505
If she was blind too...

1174
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,246
...she could've played Rani
Mukherjee's part in 'Black 2'.

1175
01:06:53,234 --> 01:06:58,240
"You won't know the worth
of a pinch of vermillion, mister."

1176
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,504
Hey mister, listen here.

1177
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:02,773
We don't understand
your nonsense at all.

1178
01:07:03,034 --> 01:07:05,947
First you blabber something,
then this dog barks...

1179
01:07:06,067 --> 01:07:08,707
Hey, his name is Sakru.

1180
01:07:09,434 --> 01:07:11,311
Wow, then he'll come in handy.

1181
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,471
Anyway. <i>..</i>

1182
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:14,444
First he barks, and then you bark...

1183
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,478
I mean you speak after him.

1184
01:07:15,634 --> 01:07:17,079
I mean what's this threesome.

1185
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:20,911
You see, Sakru understands
what Sindoor aunty says.

1186
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:22,876
And I understand what Sakru says.

1187
01:07:32,334 --> 01:07:35,315
There's only one hero
amongst all these villains.

1188
01:07:35,567 --> 01:07:36,375
Who is he?

1189
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,873
Why don't you go up?

1190
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,806
No, no. I meant the
room besides your brother.

1191
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,077
Brother-in-law and sister,
take them inside.

1192
01:07:48,867 --> 01:07:50,540
Hello. - Come, come.

1193
01:07:53,067 --> 01:07:53,875
Who could it be now?

1194
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:55,741
Whenever this bell rings...

1195
01:07:55,834 --> 01:07:57,711
...there's always
some kind of trouble.

1196
01:07:57,767 --> 01:07:58,973
You shut up. - Wait, wait.

1197
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,246
Go see what new problem is it now?

1198
01:08:10,734 --> 01:08:11,371
Oh my, God.

1199
01:08:12,534 --> 01:08:13,672
Why are you giving expressions...

1200
01:08:13,734 --> 01:08:15,145
...like it's a big problem.

1201
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:16,505
It is a big problem.

1202
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,376
My real father's here. - What?

1203
01:08:19,567 --> 01:08:22,173
But who gave him my address? - I did.

1204
01:08:22,267 --> 01:08:22,836
What?

1205
01:08:22,967 --> 01:08:25,675
As your friend, I called
him up and told him everything.

1206
01:08:25,767 --> 01:08:27,508
What? - He yelled at me and hung up.

1207
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,170
I didn't know he'll
come here personally.

1208
01:08:29,234 --> 01:08:31,339
That's why I came here dressed
as your father, to help you out.

1209
01:08:31,534 --> 01:08:33,104
Our entire plan is ruined.

1210
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,903
Couldn't you find a better
time to show your friendship?

1211
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,377
Sorry, buddy. But don't open the door.

1212
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,673
Or else it'll become
a triple role of your father.

1213
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,777
Should I let them stay outside? - Yes.

1214
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,403
Your aunty will like it. - Get lost.

1215
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,145
They'll pop it for a while,
and then leave.

1216
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,907
What? - The bell.

1217
01:08:48,434 --> 01:08:50,846
My father won't leave so easily.

1218
01:08:51,034 --> 01:08:52,377
He'll come in and pop us.

1219
01:08:52,467 --> 01:08:53,878
Who would know that better than me?

1220
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:54,970
What.

1221
01:08:58,634 --> 01:08:59,510
Someone's ringing the bell...

1222
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,806
...and you're not opening the door.

1223
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:03,643
Guests are like God, son.

1224
01:09:03,834 --> 01:09:05,472
Open the door.
- Open the door.

1225
01:09:05,567 --> 01:09:08,070
This guest will surely send us to God.

1226
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:09,873
I was about to open it.

1227
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:13,207
But either the police or the
beggar rings the bell for so long.

1228
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:14,602
Police won't come here.

1229
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,208
So I thought it must be beggars.

1230
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,641
Beggars are also a effigy of God, son.

1231
01:09:19,134 --> 01:09:20,704
Okay, I'll open the door.
- No, no, no.

1232
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,041
How can you open
the door when I am here?

1233
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:23,669
You're elder to me.
I'll open the door.

1234
01:09:23,734 --> 01:09:25,077
You go inside, go on.

1235
01:09:25,134 --> 01:09:29,276
These things have no
connection with age, son.

1236
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:30,944
Come on, I'll open it.

1237
01:09:33,534 --> 01:09:34,342
Welcome.

1238
01:09:34,433 --> 01:09:34,968
Hello. - Hi.

1239
01:09:35,034 --> 01:09:38,140
Come in. - Mister,
you look from a descent family.

1240
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,010
So why do you carry
these big suitcases and beg?

1241
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,077
I had heard about
International Khiladi (Player).

1242
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:44,976
But this is the first time I
saw an International Bhikari (beggar).

1243
01:09:45,034 --> 01:09:47,776
You are a beggar,
you and your entire family.

1244
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:50,205
Do I look like beggars to you?

1245
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:54,075
My name is Mr. P.K. Lele.

1246
01:09:54,234 --> 01:09:55,838
And that handsome
boy standing there...

1247
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,776
Look here.

1248
01:09:57,367 --> 01:09:59,176
I am his father.

1249
01:09:59,801 --> 01:10:01,075
Oh, God! Another Pop!

1250
01:10:01,134 --> 01:10:03,239
Mister, don't forget your manners.

1251
01:10:03,434 --> 01:10:05,914
This handsome boy
you're talking about...

1252
01:10:05,967 --> 01:10:07,844
...I am his future father-in-law.

1253
01:10:07,934 --> 01:10:09,504
Surya Karjatiya.

1254
01:10:09,734 --> 01:10:11,736
Kanhaiyya...he's your father...

1255
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,302
...he's your father
and he's also your father.

1256
01:10:13,367 --> 01:10:15,313
So many fathers? - Speak up.

1257
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,546
Yes...and no.

1258
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,302
That is my mother.

1259
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:21,771
Kanhaiyya, what's going on?

1260
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,841
Which fathers is he talking about?

1261
01:10:23,934 --> 01:10:26,471
He's talking about your sins.

1262
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:27,978
Let's go now, I'll explain you later.

1263
01:10:28,034 --> 01:10:29,479
Go get some rest first.
- Where are you taking us?

1264
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,307
Why was that old
man calling me a beggar?

1265
01:10:31,434 --> 01:10:32,208
Bloody old man.

1266
01:10:33,667 --> 01:10:34,509
Kanhaiyya.

1267
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:38,511
Why did you lock them up in the room?

1268
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:41,039
And what's this exhibition of fathers?

1269
01:10:41,267 --> 01:10:42,769
No exhibition...

1270
01:10:43,134 --> 01:10:45,114
He's my step-father.

1271
01:10:45,234 --> 01:10:48,613
Step-father? - Yes...didn't
I tell you it's a long story.

1272
01:10:48,867 --> 01:10:51,211
My mother, who was first my aunty.

1273
01:10:51,367 --> 01:10:52,903
He's her husband.

1274
01:10:53,034 --> 01:10:54,911
My step-mother's step-husband...

1275
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,545
...which is my future step-father.

1276
01:10:58,234 --> 01:11:00,180
But unfortunately, my step-mother...

1277
01:11:00,367 --> 01:11:03,314
...has come here with her boyfriend.

1278
01:11:04,601 --> 01:11:07,241
You mean your aunt's your mother now.

1279
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,745
Yes and no.

1280
01:11:09,067 --> 01:11:13,174
Actually...my aunty left
my father for her new boyfriend.

1281
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,337
Yeah... I didn't get it.

1282
01:11:15,434 --> 01:11:19,610
Wait, son. Whatever you said,
please explain hat in Hindi.

1283
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,713
Basically, father...Madhuri
has left Monish Bahl...

1284
01:11:22,767 --> 01:11:24,576
...and going around with Salman.

1285
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,507
Oh, then say it like that.

1286
01:11:26,634 --> 01:11:28,170
Now I get it. - Right?

1287
01:11:28,234 --> 01:11:29,304
But what can be done now?

1288
01:11:29,634 --> 01:11:31,341
Your father is crazy
about your aunty...

1289
01:11:31,867 --> 01:11:33,778
...but she hits on other guys.

1290
01:11:34,034 --> 01:11:36,241
I can understand your emotion.

1291
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:40,310
But why did your father
lock those two up in the room?

1292
01:11:40,634 --> 01:11:42,307
Well...well...

1293
01:11:42,401 --> 01:11:44,381
Because I knew that my father...

1294
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:48,313
...wouldn't be able to see
my aunty with her new boyfriend.

1295
01:11:48,534 --> 01:11:50,104
And if anything happens to him...

1296
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,976
...then I'll become
fatherless instantly.

1297
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:54,736
Papa!

1298
01:11:56,701 --> 01:11:57,975
How sad.

1299
01:11:58,734 --> 01:12:01,544
I am really sad to know...

1300
01:12:01,767 --> 01:12:04,748
...that someone's trying
to have fun on your expenses.

1301
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:07,909
Kanhaiyya's aunt is at fault too.

1302
01:12:08,134 --> 01:12:10,444
If she hadn't fallen...then
this would've never happened.

1303
01:12:11,467 --> 01:12:13,037
But I've compromised with the fact...

1304
01:12:13,234 --> 01:12:14,269
...that what's done is done.

1305
01:12:14,434 --> 01:12:15,674
Someone else slept with her.

1306
01:12:15,934 --> 01:12:20,508
But how can anyone sleep
with her other than me. - What?

1307
01:12:21,567 --> 01:12:24,639
I mean...I will awaken her. - Who?

1308
01:12:25,134 --> 01:12:26,238
Her love...

1309
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:29,240
The heart that once beat for you.

1310
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:33,245
That's rituals,
that's values...and that's tradition.

1311
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,140
But you don't have too long. - What?

1312
01:12:36,234 --> 01:12:38,475
No, I mean you're here
only for a short time.

1313
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,739
You'll fix their marriage and leave.

1314
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,442
No!

1315
01:12:44,267 --> 01:12:45,405
No! - No!

1316
01:12:45,734 --> 01:12:50,683
Now...I'll leave only
after fixing all the relations.

1317
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:56,247
My daughters...as well
as my daughter's mother-in-law's.

1318
01:12:56,667 --> 01:12:57,475
Come, dear.

1319
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,601
Let's go.

1320
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,146
We're <i>sc***</i> because of your father.

1321
01:13:02,434 --> 01:13:03,879
Now he wants to unite your aunty...

1322
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,106
...with your real father,
who's actually a fake. - Yes.

1323
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,508
Until now I called her aunty...

1324
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,236
...so how can I call her dear.

1325
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:11,737
You stay away from her.

1326
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:13,072
So what if she isn't my real mother.

1327
01:13:13,434 --> 01:13:15,539
But even she has
changed my soiled pants.

1328
01:13:15,967 --> 01:13:17,002
I will stay away.

1329
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:20,805
But that Karjatiya will
keep trying to bring us closer.

1330
01:13:21,134 --> 01:13:22,112
Whatever...

1331
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:25,406
Your aunty looks like a MILF. - MILF.

1332
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:27,707
'Maasi I Love to Facebook!'

1333
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,106
What did you think?

1334
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:31,005
I am saw

1335
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:33,641
Kanhaiyya open the door.

1336
01:13:34,601 --> 01:13:38,242
Open the door, or else your
father will knock it down. - Open it.

1337
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:40,712
Don't you know my power?

1338
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,036
Open the door or else I'll break it.

1339
01:13:43,434 --> 01:13:44,310
I will break it!

1340
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,906
"To make a flora out flowers..."

1341
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:02,241
"To make a flora out flowers..."

1342
01:14:02,301 --> 01:14:04,872
"One needs some silk, and some glass."

1343
01:14:05,067 --> 01:14:07,741
If you hadn't caught me,
I would've fallen down.

1344
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,279
How could I let you fall?

1345
01:14:09,334 --> 01:14:10,404
After all you're Kanhaiyya's aunty...

1346
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,410
I mean his mother.

1347
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:14,140
If I was falling down,
you would've caught me too.

1348
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:19,047
First you fall...and
then watch how I catch you.

1349
01:14:20,067 --> 01:14:22,047
Stop behaving cheaply.

1350
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:25,741
And tell me, son.
What's going on? - Yes.

1351
01:14:25,834 --> 01:14:27,040
Why did you lock us up?

1352
01:14:27,101 --> 01:14:30,378
To save you an aunty
from Karjatiya's parrot.

1353
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:32,504
Yes, his parrot's so sweet.

1354
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:33,443
Shut up.

1355
01:14:33,901 --> 01:14:36,609
And stop praising other's parrots.

1356
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,144
He goes crazy when
he sees boobsurat...

1357
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,506
...I mean Khoobsurat
(Beautiful) women.

1358
01:14:40,567 --> 01:14:41,545
Yes!

1359
01:14:41,767 --> 01:14:45,214
Dad, I locked you inside to save
you from Karjatiya's pervert parrot.

1360
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,244
Yes!

1361
01:14:46,334 --> 01:14:49,315
Sir, that parrot's got
a bad reputation in Bangkok.

1362
01:14:49,367 --> 01:14:49,970
Yes!

1363
01:14:50,034 --> 01:14:52,207
Do I look like a parrot to you? - Yes!

1364
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:53,569
No, no...

1365
01:14:53,634 --> 01:14:56,080
Stop making a fool out of me.

1366
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,943
And tell me, son.

1367
01:14:58,267 --> 01:15:01,771
I don't see your
scoundrel friend Rocky.

1368
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:06,839
By the way, I wouldn't have
come here if he hadn't called me.

1369
01:15:07,034 --> 01:15:08,274
And why wouldn't I come.

1370
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:10,870
After all...I am your father.

1371
01:15:13,834 --> 01:15:15,438
"Rocky. . Rocky"

1372
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:24,007
His face reminds me...of Rocky.

1373
01:15:27,001 --> 01:15:27,945
Rocky?

1374
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,001
Rocky who?

1375
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:33,137
He was a shameless and cheap guy.

1376
01:15:33,201 --> 01:15:38,014
He turned his
granny...into super-granny.

1377
01:15:38,434 --> 01:15:39,003
I mean she's dead.

1378
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:40,043
Is that what happened?

1379
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,171
Rocky...
How can my face look like him?

1380
01:15:42,234 --> 01:15:43,440
Look. How this possible?

1381
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,240
Look.

1382
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,210
Yeah...that's really big.

1383
01:15:48,134 --> 01:15:49,545
Oh my, God. Sorry, sorry.

1384
01:15:49,634 --> 01:15:50,942
No problem. - How stupid of you.

1385
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,540
I forgive you.

1386
01:15:52,634 --> 01:15:53,669
By the way, son...

1387
01:15:53,767 --> 01:15:56,577
...why was karjatiya
calling him your father?

1388
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:59,546
Father? No? He's my boss.

1389
01:15:59,634 --> 01:16:02,672
Since I came here,
he's treated me like a son.

1390
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,879
He recognised my
talent that you didn't.

1391
01:16:06,267 --> 01:16:07,610
And that's why, for Mr. Karjatiya...

1392
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,179
...he's like my father.

1393
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,179
By the way,
is he actually someone's father...

1394
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,506
...or is he still a bachelor?

1395
01:16:14,034 --> 01:16:18,278
Why are you eager to know?
- For general knowledge.

1396
01:16:18,367 --> 01:16:20,506
Generally your general knowledge...

1397
01:16:20,734 --> 01:16:22,236
...is limited to the bedroom.

1398
01:16:22,834 --> 01:16:25,212
By the way, son...who's this Nepali?

1399
01:16:25,434 --> 01:16:30,008
He... - I am the guy
who recognised his talent...

1400
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,745
...which even his father couldn't.

1401
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:36,143
So...he's like a father to him.

1402
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,301
Yes.

1403
01:16:37,534 --> 01:16:40,344
And what about the
others that were here?

1404
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:42,911
We're the front-end,
and they're back-end.

1405
01:16:43,001 --> 01:16:46,210
And together we lend
each other a hand in our job.

1406
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,302
What do you guys do?

1407
01:16:48,934 --> 01:16:52,780
We've a huge factory
of Organic Sandwich.

1408
01:16:52,834 --> 01:16:54,939
We all roll over each
other and work together.

1409
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,238
Do come some day we'll
let you lick the sauce.

1410
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,337
You must be tired,
I'll go take some rest.

1411
01:17:01,734 --> 01:17:04,578
I mean you must be tired,
go get some rest.

1412
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:06,474
Come, let me show you your room.

1413
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:07,170
Come.

1414
01:17:07,501 --> 01:17:08,138
Go on.

1415
01:17:09,734 --> 01:17:10,735
Sauce... - Yes. Mine's already out.

1416
01:17:23,767 --> 01:17:25,747
Kanhaiyya's aunty is
openly giving it to me.

1417
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:26,871
Line.

1418
01:17:28,067 --> 01:17:30,104
Kanhaiyya's step-mother...

1419
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,340
...wants to make you her lover.

1420
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,346
She's in full mood to
sing a duet with you. - Quiet.

1421
01:17:34,534 --> 01:17:36,480
Don't say this in front
of Kanhaiyya. - Why.

1422
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,011
He'll break my bones.

1423
01:17:38,401 --> 01:17:41,041
Let him play his flute with his Radha.

1424
01:17:56,967 --> 01:17:59,811
"I am crazy Karimi."

1425
01:18:00,334 --> 01:18:03,144
"I am single and lonely."

1426
01:18:10,567 --> 01:18:13,980
"I am crazy Karimi. - O Boy."

1427
01:18:14,034 --> 01:18:17,379
"I am single and lonely. - O Boy."

1428
01:18:17,434 --> 01:18:20,574
"I am a hot cracker. - O Boy."

1429
01:18:20,634 --> 01:18:24,207
"I am like Lady Gaga. - O Boy."

1430
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:25,974
"Give me... Give me."

1431
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,672
"Give it to me."

1432
01:18:27,767 --> 01:18:34,878
"Will you give me your heart."

1433
01:18:35,034 --> 01:18:38,447
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

1434
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,845
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

1435
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,211
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

1436
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,838
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

1437
01:18:52,034 --> 01:18:53,411
"Come on everybody move it!"

1438
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:55,146
"Come on everybody shake it!"

1439
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,073
"Come on everybody do it like I do!"

1440
01:18:57,167 --> 01:18:58,407
"Like the sexy lady."

1441
01:19:08,967 --> 01:19:10,275
"Handle with care..."

1442
01:19:10,467 --> 01:19:12,378
"...I am fragile item."

1443
01:19:12,567 --> 01:19:16,071
"We'll spend the night
in the candle night."

1444
01:19:16,134 --> 01:19:19,513
"I'll start with
slowly-slowly touching you."

1445
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:23,204
"Don't pretend,
you're a master in this."

1446
01:19:23,934 --> 01:19:25,470
<i>“Baby, baby...“</i>

1447
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,170
"You're my baby."

1448
01:19:27,334 --> 01:19:34,582
"From now I'll be your soft toy."

1449
01:19:34,734 --> 01:19:37,943
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

1450
01:19:38,067 --> 01:19:41,344
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

1451
01:19:41,534 --> 01:19:44,777
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

1452
01:19:44,967 --> 01:19:48,278
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

1453
01:20:11,934 --> 01:20:13,311
"Love in the air..."

1454
01:20:13,367 --> 01:20:15,404
"...darling, feel the ambiance."

1455
01:20:15,534 --> 01:20:18,708
"Get ready, we're going
to love each other awesome."

1456
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,443
"There's an intoxication
taking over me."

1457
01:20:22,634 --> 01:20:26,411
"It's a short game,
but it's lots of fun."

1458
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:28,446
<i>“Baby, baby...“</i>

1459
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:30,112
"You're my baby."

1460
01:20:30,401 --> 01:20:36,545
"From now I'll be your soft toy."

1461
01:20:37,767 --> 01:20:40,976
"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

1462
01:20:41,234 --> 01:20:44,340
"O Boy...

1463
01:20:44,534 --> 01:20:47,879
"O Boy...

"O Boy...
O Boy... You're my soft toy."

1467
01:21:03,867 --> 01:21:06,746
Look, he's snatched our
peace and sleeping himself.

1468
01:21:06,934 --> 01:21:08,004
Get up.

1469
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,076
Son, lift up your a”

1470
01:21:11,267 --> 01:21:13,269
If you keep dreaming all day...

1471
01:21:13,334 --> 01:21:15,746
...then your dreams of
becoming rich will shatter.

1472
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:17,074
What do you mean?

1473
01:21:17,134 --> 01:21:21,674
I mean...the client's giving
me sleepless nights for a new DP.

1474
01:21:22,001 --> 01:21:23,139
Please explain him.

1475
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,441
In my line of work,
the competition is tough.

1476
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,144
And for this job,
I only need two things.

1477
01:21:28,201 --> 01:21:29,544
Camera and room, very simple.

1478
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,374
Wait a minute.

1479
01:21:30,934 --> 01:21:32,641
How will you shoot a
film in all this confusion?

1480
01:21:32,734 --> 01:21:34,304
Don't worry.

1481
01:21:34,434 --> 01:21:38,610
I'll shoot so secretly,
that no one will know.

1482
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,279
Kalim...an ordinary girl like her...

1483
01:21:43,334 --> 01:21:46,042
...can't become the empress of India.

1484
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:48,804
Champakali is not some ordinary girl.

1485
01:21:50,767 --> 01:21:52,178
She's a virgin.

1486
01:21:52,467 --> 01:21:55,539
Beautiful, capricious and alluring.

1487
01:21:55,701 --> 01:21:58,181
If you can give her
your royal piece...

1488
01:21:58,301 --> 01:21:59,575
If that's the case...

1489
01:21:59,667 --> 01:22:02,773
...then I won't bury her in the wall.

1490
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,343
In fact, I'll take her to heaven.

1491
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:07,701
Come on, baby.

1492
01:22:07,767 --> 01:22:12,409
I am scared, your highness.

1493
01:22:12,834 --> 01:22:15,747
When in love...no need to be afraid.

1494
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:19,471
Cut. Cut. Cut.

1495
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:21,105
What's the secret code?

1496
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,010
Go take a look.

1497
01:22:23,334 --> 01:22:24,438
Kanhaiya, you?

1498
01:22:24,901 --> 01:22:26,437
You're shooting Mughal-e-Azam...

1499
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,509
And father's waiting
at the dining table...

1500
01:22:28,601 --> 01:22:29,739
...to have Mughlai food with everyone.

1501
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,573
Just five more minutes,
we're at the climax.

1502
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:32,737
Hurry up. Hurry UP-

1503
01:22:33,734 --> 01:22:34,337
Wait.

1504
01:22:34,434 --> 01:22:35,640
What's the secret code?

1505
01:22:38,267 --> 01:22:39,610
That must be Sucku.

1506
01:22:39,734 --> 01:22:40,838
Only she makes sounds like that.

1507
01:22:40,967 --> 01:22:43,208
Take her in. - Yes.

1508
01:22:49,634 --> 01:22:51,409
It's the deaf aunty standing outside.

1509
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:53,443
I hope...she didn't see anything.

1510
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:55,811
And if she did,
she'll go blind with shock.

1511
01:22:55,934 --> 01:22:58,881
Hide. Everyone hide. - Hide.

1512
01:22:58,934 --> 01:23:01,540
Rocky, idea. Idea.

1513
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:02,875
Say it. Say it.

1514
01:23:04,934 --> 01:23:06,436
No overacting...careful.

1515
01:23:17,767 --> 01:23:19,110
What's going on here?

1516
01:23:19,467 --> 01:23:22,311
Actually...we're doing a play...

1517
01:23:22,367 --> 01:23:24,176
...for the Indian
organization of Bangkok.

1518
01:23:24,234 --> 01:23:25,304
Pavitra Rishtey.

1519
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:26,607
We were rehearsing for that.

1520
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:27,708
Yes.

1521
01:23:32,767 --> 01:23:35,771
But what was that girl
doing bent over before him?

1522
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:36,805
She...

1523
01:23:36,867 --> 01:23:40,041
Actually, she's washing
her father's feet before dinner.

1524
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:46,276
Normally we wash our
hands before a meal...

1525
01:23:46,334 --> 01:23:47,335
...who washes their feet.

1526
01:23:47,434 --> 01:23:50,074
In our family,
we wash everything before a meal.

1527
01:23:51,234 --> 01:23:51,905
Why?

1528
01:23:53,134 --> 01:23:54,807
Because...before eating our meal...

1529
01:23:54,967 --> 01:23:57,413
...we join our hands
and thank the Lord.

1530
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,776
Because God's revered through
a clean mind, and clean body. - Yes.

1531
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:03,140
Lord, help us.

1532
01:24:03,734 --> 01:24:07,546
"Radha's incomplete without Shyam."

1533
01:24:07,734 --> 01:24:12,274
<i>“Say Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.“</i>

1534
01:24:12,367 --> 01:24:16,372
"Radha's incomplete without Shyam."

1535
01:24:17,801 --> 01:24:19,781
Even after living in Thailand...

1536
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:25,508
...you didn't forget your culture,
rituals and tradition.

1537
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:27,613
This has made me really happy.

1538
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,178
Why don't we all go
for a picnic tomorrow...

1539
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:35,146
...so that we get to
know each other better.

1540
01:24:36,267 --> 01:24:38,941
There's another thing I
would like to share with everyone.

1541
01:24:39,334 --> 01:24:41,336
My dear sister, Sindoor...

1542
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:45,644
...who lost her voice and
her husband on her wedding night...

1543
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,246
And I've always seen
disappointment on her face...

1544
01:24:48,767 --> 01:24:51,805
...and tears on her face.

1545
01:24:52,534 --> 01:24:56,949
But years later,
I can see a smile on her face.

1546
01:24:57,467 --> 01:24:58,639
And only..

1547
01:25:04,234 --> 01:25:08,080
"Radha's incomplete without Shyam."

1548
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:12,843
"Say Radhe-Radhe-Radhe."

1549
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,538
"Radha's incomplete without Shyam."

1550
01:25:16,134 --> 01:25:23,109
...that she's sitting
here with here, with us.

1551
01:25:55,467 --> 01:26:01,816
And I believe...that the
love between us should grow.

1552
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:13,674
All I want is that
we all live together...

1553
01:26:13,734 --> 01:26:16,340
...just like in Suraj
Barjatiya's films.

1554
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:19,877
And we all progress together.

1555
01:26:48,934 --> 01:26:54,282
I'll go get the sweetmeat
for you and Kanhaiyya's mother.

1556
01:26:54,434 --> 01:26:56,846
What? - No, no...

1557
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,977
I'll get sweetmeat for everyone.

1558
01:27:02,567 --> 01:27:03,341
Hello sir.

1559
01:27:10,234 --> 01:27:12,441
This mixture will
bring the spice back...

1560
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:18,073
...in Kanhaiyya's father
and aunty's shattered love life.

1561
01:27:21,334 --> 01:27:22,972
The sweetmeat's here.

1562
01:27:23,534 --> 01:27:24,740
Serve it to everyone.

1563
01:27:25,367 --> 01:27:26,744
Hurry up. - This is for you.

1564
01:27:26,934 --> 01:27:27,776
Thank you.

1565
01:27:27,967 --> 01:27:29,708
This is for you. - Thank you.

1566
01:27:30,367 --> 01:27:32,005
The sweetmeats really nice.

1567
01:28:12,901 --> 01:28:14,847
What's wrong with you today?

1568
01:28:14,934 --> 01:28:16,174
You're not getting tired.

1569
01:28:21,367 --> 01:28:23,040
Plan successful.

1570
01:28:28,634 --> 01:28:29,669
Who could it be at this hour?

1571
01:28:29,967 --> 01:28:30,911
I'll see.

1572
01:28:39,801 --> 01:28:41,838
Kanhaiyya's aunty.
Hide under the building.

1573
01:28:42,034 --> 01:28:43,513
Building? - I mean hide under the bed.

1574
01:28:43,567 --> 01:28:45,069
Hide, hurry up. - Okay.

1575
01:28:45,134 --> 01:28:47,239
Where's my moustache?

1576
01:28:52,234 --> 01:28:55,477
What are you, doing here at this hour?

1577
01:28:55,767 --> 01:28:57,303
You called me here...

1578
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,970
...and now you're asking
what am I doing here?

1579
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,305
I called you.

1580
01:29:00,367 --> 01:29:01,607
Naughty boy?-

1581
01:29:01,834 --> 01:29:03,040
Let's have some fun.

1582
01:29:03,334 --> 01:29:08,181
"I've found the gem of love."

1583
01:29:11,867 --> 01:29:13,175
That was Kanhaiyya's voice.

1584
01:29:13,867 --> 01:29:15,005
What are you doing here?

1585
01:29:17,234 --> 01:29:18,907
Kanhaiyya, open the door.

1586
01:29:18,967 --> 01:29:20,241
Hide, hide... - Kanhaiyya.

1587
01:29:22,401 --> 01:29:24,540
Father. - Is everything fine?

1588
01:29:24,867 --> 01:29:26,540
Yes. - I heard you scream.

1589
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,874
No, father, nothing to worry about.

1590
01:29:27,934 --> 01:29:29,607
Go and sleep. It's quite late.

1591
01:29:29,701 --> 01:29:30,839
I'll sleep too. - Yes.

1592
01:29:30,934 --> 01:29:33,107
Okay. - Early to bed, early to rise.

1593
01:29:33,434 --> 01:29:34,970
Come on, baby.
Come. - What if someone comes here?

1594
01:29:35,034 --> 01:29:36,604
We'll get in problem.
- No one will come.

1595
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:37,975
We will come.

1596
01:29:38,034 --> 01:29:39,604
Look, Kanhaiyya will never forgive me.

1597
01:29:39,867 --> 01:29:43,212
I want you to have
a relation with him...

1598
01:29:43,267 --> 01:29:45,406
...which even his father couldn't.

1599
01:29:45,467 --> 01:29:47,105
What relation?

1600
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:49,738
As a friend. - I am his friend.

1601
01:29:49,834 --> 01:29:51,142
I mean I am also his friend.

1602
01:29:51,234 --> 01:29:54,078
Then come on, let's turn
this friendship into something more.

1603
01:29:54,134 --> 01:29:56,273
No, please.. - Right now.

1604
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,978
Shalu. You know the red color...

1605
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:03,705
What are you doing? - Sorry.

1606
01:30:03,767 --> 01:30:04,541
I didn't mean that.

1607
01:30:04,734 --> 01:30:06,873
No, no, no.

1608
01:30:07,167 --> 01:30:10,478
You're okay? - Focus. Focus. Focus.

1609
01:30:12,134 --> 01:30:13,340
Kanhaiyya.

1610
01:30:17,234 --> 01:30:19,714
What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

1611
01:30:20,067 --> 01:30:21,637
Come on, baby. - Not now.

1612
01:30:21,734 --> 01:30:24,180
What if father comes back?
- I don't care.

1613
01:30:24,667 --> 01:30:26,044
Since I saw you...

1614
01:30:26,234 --> 01:30:28,236
...there's just one thought
that crosses my mind.

1615
01:30:28,301 --> 01:30:29,302
Which one?

1616
01:30:29,401 --> 01:30:30,903
"Let the dawn not rise."

1617
01:30:31,067 --> 01:30:32,944
"Let's not lose this night."

1618
01:30:33,034 --> 01:30:35,776
"Let's not let each other sleep."

1619
01:30:35,867 --> 01:30:37,505
"I am you're hero?" - Yeah.

1620
01:30:37,567 --> 01:30:38,637
That's my favourite film.

1621
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,770
I'll go get the DVD right away.

1622
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:42,406
Where are you going?
- I'll go get the DVD.

1623
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:51,510
All I want is that you
and me are locked in a room...

1624
01:30:51,567 --> 01:30:54,514
...and the Key's found.
- You mean lost.

1625
01:30:54,567 --> 01:30:56,410
Yeah, yeah...whatever."

1626
01:30:59,434 --> 01:31:00,378
Let's go, Prem.

1627
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:12,771
Why are you following me around?

1628
01:31:16,134 --> 01:31:17,340
I am going to sleep.

1629
01:31:17,467 --> 01:31:19,344
You go sleep too...with this Sakru.

1630
01:31:20,967 --> 01:31:21,968
Sorry.

1631
01:31:22,301 --> 01:31:23,211
Goodnight.

1632
01:31:34,867 --> 01:31:36,540
I told you father will come back.

1633
01:31:36,634 --> 01:31:38,545
Now hide, hide.

1634
01:31:41,301 --> 01:31:43,144
What are you doing outside
my room at this hour?

1635
01:31:43,234 --> 01:31:44,474
Your aunty...

1636
01:31:47,534 --> 01:31:49,309
What happened?
- Your aunt's in my room.

1637
01:31:49,567 --> 01:31:51,137
And she's hell-bent
on making me your father.

1638
01:31:51,367 --> 01:31:52,778
10 minutes more, and 9 months later...

1639
01:31:52,867 --> 01:31:54,346
...our kid would call you brother.

1640
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,710
Rascal, did you do
something wrong with her?

1641
01:31:56,767 --> 01:31:58,212
I wouldn't be here if I wanted to.

1642
01:31:58,300 --> 01:31:58,971
Come, I'll show you.

1643
01:32:07,101 --> 01:32:08,341
Yeah!

1644
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,873
Early to bed and early to rise.

1645
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,371
Makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.

1646
01:32:18,867 --> 01:32:21,677
Father's coming...this
way with his parrot.

1647
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:24,037
Where did he come from?

1648
01:32:26,234 --> 01:32:28,214
Want to have some fun? - Yes.

1649
01:32:28,267 --> 01:32:29,007
Take him with you.

1650
01:32:29,134 --> 01:32:30,340
Lights off, pack up!

1651
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,107
How did the lights go off?

1652
01:32:37,067 --> 01:32:38,375
Come on, I'll show you.

1653
01:32:41,734 --> 01:32:42,804
Strange.

1654
01:32:43,567 --> 01:32:46,207
I heard a commotion and light.

1655
01:32:46,667 --> 01:32:48,203
What happened suddenly?

1656
01:32:51,334 --> 01:32:52,278
See.

1657
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:58,072
See. - Yes.

1658
01:33:33,234 --> 01:33:34,804
Such nice people.

1659
01:33:34,867 --> 01:33:37,313
Noble. Courteous. Cultured.

1660
01:33:37,434 --> 01:33:38,276
Right, aunty.

1661
01:33:44,001 --> 01:33:45,947
What are you doing here at this hour?

1662
01:33:47,367 --> 01:33:50,541
I...was looking for the bathroom.

1663
01:33:51,367 --> 01:33:53,608
I will have to take a bath.

1664
01:34:01,901 --> 01:34:04,507
Watching my aunty behave so cheaply...

1665
01:34:04,767 --> 01:34:05,871
...makes me want to puke.

1666
01:34:06,134 --> 01:34:07,909
I am sure Karjatiya is behind this.

1667
01:34:08,234 --> 01:34:10,305
Otherwise my aunty would
never do a thing like this.

1668
01:34:10,434 --> 01:34:12,243
We must stop Karjatiya at any cost.

1669
01:34:12,534 --> 01:34:14,810
Otherwise...aunty will
try to rock my world every day.

1670
01:34:15,434 --> 01:34:16,742
We must make that
old man understand...

1671
01:34:17,001 --> 01:34:20,414
...no matter how hard he tries,
it won't kindle aunt's flame for me.

1672
01:34:20,901 --> 01:34:21,504
How's that?

1673
01:34:21,734 --> 01:34:22,872
"Rocky."

1674
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,340
By telling him...

1675
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,279
...the one holding my rolling-pin...

1676
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:28,941
...is another Vidya
Balan in my kitchen.

1677
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,535
Another Vidya Balan?

1678
01:34:30,934 --> 01:34:32,038
Yes. - I didn't get it.

1679
01:34:32,867 --> 01:34:34,847
I mean my fake girlfriend.

1680
01:34:35,267 --> 01:34:36,746
Fake girlfriend? - Yes.

1681
01:34:36,967 --> 01:34:39,743
I mean your fake second step-mother.

1682
01:34:42,534 --> 01:34:45,777
Now watch...how I turn
your family's clean picture...

1683
01:34:46,301 --> 01:34:48,178
...into a dirty picture.

1684
01:34:52,934 --> 01:34:55,073
"Rocky!"

1685
01:34:55,134 --> 01:34:57,614
Of course, darling. I miss you too.

1686
01:34:57,934 --> 01:34:58,878
And I love you too.

1687
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,510
Yes, yes. Don't worry, I miss you too.

1688
01:35:03,134 --> 01:35:05,080
Darling, I must go.
I'll call you later.

1689
01:35:05,234 --> 01:35:06,372
Okay, love you.

1690
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:08,744
Who were you talking to?

1691
01:35:09,267 --> 01:35:11,008
I think you're hiding
something from me.

1692
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,338
You're absolutely right.

1693
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:15,543
I was hiding it from you.

1694
01:35:15,934 --> 01:35:18,278
But what to do, love is such a thing.

1695
01:35:18,501 --> 01:35:20,447
No matter how hard you try,
you can't hide it.

1696
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:21,810
I didn't get it.

1697
01:35:23,201 --> 01:35:25,374
That was my girlfriend. - Girlfriend?

1698
01:35:25,634 --> 01:35:28,114
I love her...and I'm
soon going to marry her.

1699
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,606
And so I have a request.

1700
01:35:29,834 --> 01:35:32,974
Please don't try to reunite
me and Kanhaiyya's aunty..

1701
01:35:33,201 --> 01:35:35,477
...I mean my first wife.

1702
01:35:35,834 --> 01:35:37,211
There's no place for her in my life.

1703
01:35:37,967 --> 01:35:40,174
Prem, another mother.

1704
01:35:41,501 --> 01:35:45,210
I wonder how Kanhaiyya
will handle so many mothers.

1705
01:35:46,134 --> 01:35:47,238
Well, okay.

1706
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:50,037
I would like to meet
your new companion.

1707
01:35:50,234 --> 01:35:51,076
What?

1708
01:35:51,434 --> 01:35:53,311
What's the point
of meeting her? - What?

1709
01:35:53,534 --> 01:35:54,569
Satisfaction.

1710
01:35:54,867 --> 01:35:58,747
The woman who's going to
be my Shalu's mother-in-law...

1711
01:35:58,834 --> 01:36:03,078
...I must know her character,
her lifestyle, and her mannerisms.

1712
01:36:03,301 --> 01:36:05,178
What do you care about her character?

1713
01:36:05,401 --> 01:36:07,210
Why wouldn't I be?

1714
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:10,904
I want to handover my
daughter to your son happily.

1715
01:36:11,134 --> 01:36:12,340
Do one thing.

1716
01:36:12,734 --> 01:36:14,236
We're all going for a picnic.

1717
01:36:14,401 --> 01:36:17,814
Bring your new girlfriend
there in one hour.

1718
01:36:18,134 --> 01:36:19,204
One hour!

1719
01:36:19,667 --> 01:36:20,543
One hour!

1720
01:36:20,601 --> 01:36:21,375
One hour!

1721
01:36:21,634 --> 01:36:23,910
How's that possible?

1722
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:27,371
Rocky, if you don't introduce
my future step-mother...

1723
01:36:27,767 --> 01:36:29,610
...to my future father-in-law, then...

1724
01:36:29,967 --> 01:36:32,140
...he'll never give me his daughter.

1725
01:36:32,534 --> 01:36:35,708
No worries...no problem.

1726
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,381
If you can have two fake fathers...

1727
01:36:40,401 --> 01:36:42,847
...then can't you
have a fake step-mother?

1728
01:36:43,034 --> 01:36:43,739
Mother?

1729
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:08,280
Jimmy, I doubt this
old hag's intentions.

1730
01:37:08,634 --> 01:37:10,204
I think she'll spare
me only after give and take.

1731
01:37:11,934 --> 01:37:13,345
Did you tell anyone anything?

1732
01:37:21,434 --> 01:37:22,504
What's she saying?

1733
01:37:24,167 --> 01:37:26,909
I was looking for your
room last night? - What?

1734
01:37:26,967 --> 01:37:27,741
What?

1735
01:37:32,001 --> 01:37:33,036
What's she doing?

1736
01:37:35,201 --> 01:37:37,613
I want to take a
jet-ski ride with you.

1737
01:37:37,667 --> 01:37:39,647
Who will go on a
jet-ski ride with you?

1738
01:37:39,701 --> 01:37:41,612
Not me, she's saying it.

1739
01:37:41,667 --> 01:37:43,476
And you can't say no to Sindoor aunty.

1740
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:46,574
Who can avert destiny.
Come, I'll take you.

1741
01:37:52,267 --> 01:37:53,644
That was fun, dear. - Yes, it was.

1742
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:57,671
Look, Mr. Karjatiya,
I've brought my Vidya along.

1743
01:38:15,034 --> 01:38:17,241
Focus. Focus. - Focus.

1744
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,042
Father.

1745
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,201
You look...

1746
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:28,637
Look... - What?

1747
01:38:28,767 --> 01:38:31,839
You look just like Shalu's mom.

1748
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,340
What? - What?

1749
01:38:34,634 --> 01:38:35,237
Yes.

1750
01:38:35,467 --> 01:38:38,778
You reminded me and my
parrot about Shalu's mother.

1751
01:38:39,067 --> 01:38:41,104
Naughty. - No, honestly.

1752
01:38:41,267 --> 01:38:43,178
Look, this is her picture. Look.

1753
01:38:43,301 --> 01:38:44,780
Ooh la la!

1754
01:38:47,334 --> 01:38:48,608
What's this new twist?

1755
01:38:48,834 --> 01:38:50,836
You look just like
the old man's dead wife.

1756
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:56,273
You look like...a blossoming rose.

1757
01:38:56,667 --> 01:38:58,340
Like a poet's dream.

1758
01:38:58,601 --> 01:39:01,548
Like the sun's rays,
and a doe in the jungle.

1759
01:39:01,734 --> 01:39:04,408
1942... A Love Story.

1760
01:39:04,601 --> 01:39:07,343
No... 1972... A Love Story.

1761
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:10,013
That's when I saw Shalu's
mom for the first time.

1762
01:39:10,167 --> 01:39:13,705
And now it feels...time
has turned back again.

1763
01:39:14,234 --> 01:39:15,907
I think we should split too.

1764
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,141
Are you okay?

1765
01:39:24,767 --> 01:39:27,873
God's ways are unique.

1766
01:39:28,134 --> 01:39:32,913
You really reminded me...of my mother.

1767
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:34,169
Mom!

1768
01:39:35,601 --> 01:39:37,376
Dear. Dear.

1769
01:39:39,234 --> 01:39:41,441
Father, where did Kanhaiyya go?

1770
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:42,477
I'll go take a look.

1771
01:39:42,567 --> 01:39:43,443
Shalu baby...

1772
01:39:43,967 --> 01:39:45,947
I mean dear...

1773
01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:49,045
Don't...don't leave me alone.

1774
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:51,236
Vidya, that reminds me.

1775
01:39:51,401 --> 01:39:52,175
You had to go somewhere.

1776
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:54,677
You have an appointment in
the parlour, right? - Yes, of course.

1777
01:39:55,034 --> 01:39:57,014
"Don't leave me yet..."

1778
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:59,137
"...because my heart's
not satisfied yet."

1779
01:39:59,234 --> 01:40:01,510
You must do it with me today.

1780
01:40:01,567 --> 01:40:02,477
What? - What?

1781
01:40:02,568 --> 01:40:04,343
Lunch. - Naughty.

1782
01:40:04,667 --> 01:40:05,702
Lalita.

1783
01:40:07,134 --> 01:40:09,774
My name's P.K. Lele.

1784
01:40:09,934 --> 01:40:11,311
Nice to meet you.

1785
01:40:11,934 --> 01:40:13,504
Who's this pretty damsel?

1786
01:40:13,567 --> 01:40:15,808
This is Vidya, my girlfriend.

1787
01:40:17,167 --> 01:40:18,202
Excuse me.

1788
01:40:19,901 --> 01:40:23,678
But I think I've seen you before.

1789
01:40:23,767 --> 01:40:26,179
This is a very old pickup line.

1790
01:40:26,534 --> 01:40:28,810
But it still works.

1791
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,477
Don't be fooled by him.

1792
01:40:31,567 --> 01:40:33,513
If you dig this mountain,
you'll find a mole.

1793
01:40:33,701 --> 01:40:36,443
She won't find a lion in you either.

1794
01:40:36,767 --> 01:40:38,644
Let it be, Mr. Karjatiya.

1795
01:40:38,801 --> 01:40:40,405
I must leave now.

1796
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,307
My home is really far.

1797
01:40:42,834 --> 01:40:45,781
It'll take me three
hours to get there.

1798
01:40:46,934 --> 01:40:49,972
By the way,
I don't see our son Kanhaiyya.

1799
01:40:50,234 --> 01:40:53,181
We can't let Vidya
go until he doesn't arrive.

1800
01:40:53,267 --> 01:40:54,974
How can he come when
I am here? - What?

1801
01:40:55,067 --> 01:40:57,877
I mean...how can
he come when I am here.

1802
01:40:58,034 --> 01:40:59,741
I sent him to the nearby mall...

1803
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,780
...to get medicines...for my stomach.

1804
01:41:01,934 --> 01:41:05,711
No. we'll all go to the mall,
find him...

1805
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,573
...we'll have lunch and then go home.

1806
01:41:07,967 --> 01:41:09,378
No, no...

1807
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,078
Let's go.

1808
01:41:11,767 --> 01:41:13,246
Go on. - Let's go.

1809
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,811
Vidya... - Come on.

1810
01:41:16,067 --> 01:41:17,137
Mother...

1811
01:41:17,234 --> 01:41:19,236
I mean your aunt's got her eyes on me.

1812
01:41:19,301 --> 01:41:21,247
She keeps hitting and winking on me.

1813
01:41:21,334 --> 01:41:23,245
My own father was hitting on me.

1814
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:25,803
I told you to use lemons.

1815
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:27,709
But no, you wanted oranges.
Now you pay for it.

1816
01:41:27,767 --> 01:41:29,144
If I knew this would happen...

1817
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:30,474
...I would've used grapes instead.

1818
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:32,604
What happened? - Look.

1819
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,911
The old man's here.
- He's my father-in-law.

1820
01:41:41,001 --> 01:41:41,638
It's the same thing.

1821
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:42,906
We must do something now.

1822
01:41:42,967 --> 01:41:43,775
Come on.

1823
01:41:51,534 --> 01:41:52,535
Vidya.

1824
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,578
Hi. - Vidya.

1825
01:41:56,301 --> 01:41:59,646
Vidya. Did you find Kanhaiyya?
- Not yet. He must be around.

1826
01:41:59,901 --> 01:42:00,743
Even we're looking for him.

1827
01:42:00,834 --> 01:42:01,869
We'll find him. We'll find him.

1828
01:42:02,067 --> 01:42:02,943
And then we'll say...

1829
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:04,945
He was right here,
and we looked all over the mall.

1830
01:42:05,734 --> 01:42:07,475
Mr. Karjatiya,
we couldn't find him on this floor.

1831
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,102
Let's go look for him
on the next floor. - Yes.

1832
01:42:09,167 --> 01:42:12,580
No, no, no,
let's go in this shop first.

1833
01:42:13,133 --> 01:42:16,205
We'll buy some religious
or family films.

1834
01:42:16,434 --> 01:42:17,310
Come, dear.

1835
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:19,403
They won't find any
religious or family films...

1836
01:42:19,567 --> 01:42:22,070
...instead they'll see the
real doings of our fake family.

1837
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:22,837
Yes.

1838
01:42:22,934 --> 01:42:25,107
Before father catches us
red-handed with our pants down...

1839
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:26,440
...let's do something. - Come on.

1840
01:42:29,434 --> 01:42:30,037
Oh, no.

1841
01:42:30,367 --> 01:42:31,437
Every corner of this store...

1842
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,843
...is filled with evidence
that we've been sleeping around.

1843
01:42:33,001 --> 01:42:35,845
Rocky...we must handle this. - Wait..

1844
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:37,675
Let's buy all these DVDs...

1845
01:42:37,801 --> 01:42:39,576
...before father sees them. - Yes.

1846
01:42:39,667 --> 01:42:41,908
Let's eradicate this
problem from the root.

1847
01:43:00,234 --> 01:43:01,042
Excuse me.

1848
01:43:02,834 --> 01:43:04,245
Welcome!

1849
01:43:06,134 --> 01:43:12,085
"I am the button of your shirt..."

1850
01:43:13,534 --> 01:43:15,036
"Beloved."

1851
01:43:15,267 --> 01:43:17,907
Hey...what are you doing?
Pack the DVDs.

1852
01:43:17,967 --> 01:43:19,571
Are you Indians? - Yes, so?

1853
01:43:19,667 --> 01:43:21,442
No, looking at her I felt that...

1854
01:43:21,634 --> 01:43:24,740
...we have some old connection.

1855
01:43:26,501 --> 01:43:27,878
Yes, did you forget?

1856
01:43:28,767 --> 01:43:31,441
We were together in part 1 and part 2.

1857
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:33,941
How can I forget those two parts?

1858
01:43:34,001 --> 01:43:37,210
Hey, I think you've a lot of...

1859
01:43:38,434 --> 01:43:39,606
This is part 3.

1860
01:43:39,767 --> 01:43:41,041
Come on, pack the DVDs.

1861
01:43:41,267 --> 01:43:45,306
Okay good choice sir.

1862
01:43:45,534 --> 01:43:46,842
You're a fan of these two.

1863
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,871
Me too.

1864
01:43:48,067 --> 01:43:50,138
I can't sleep without
watching these two.

1865
01:43:50,401 --> 01:43:53,848
You see...they lighten my burden.

1866
01:43:54,834 --> 01:43:55,676
Yeah!

1867
01:43:56,967 --> 01:43:58,844
Hold on, what are you doing?

1868
01:43:59,067 --> 01:44:00,444
Store-policy, sir.

1869
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,076
You see, madam.

1870
01:44:02,234 --> 01:44:05,374
Until we don't check the
DVDs in front of the customer...

1871
01:44:05,467 --> 01:44:07,276
...we can't pack them.

1872
01:44:08,167 --> 01:44:09,077
Hurry UP-

1873
01:44:10,367 --> 01:44:11,209
Hurry UP-

1874
01:44:19,134 --> 01:44:19,976
Hurry UP-

1875
01:44:20,167 --> 01:44:21,168
I am, sir.

1876
01:44:25,234 --> 01:44:26,508
What happened?

1877
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:28,638
Sorry, sir.
I think this is a bad stock.

1878
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:30,208
I can't sell you this pile.

1879
01:44:30,267 --> 01:44:31,439
Come back when we get the new stock.

1880
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,275
We'll buy the new stock as well.

1881
01:44:33,334 --> 01:44:34,642
But if we don't buy these now...

1882
01:44:34,701 --> 01:44:35,805
...we'll be in big trouble.

1883
01:44:35,867 --> 01:44:38,143
Pack these DVDs immediately.
- Are you sure, sir?

1884
01:44:38,334 --> 01:44:38,937
Yes.

1885
01:44:39,034 --> 01:44:42,277
Pack all you have. Please.

1886
01:44:43,267 --> 01:44:46,407
I can even pack myself for you, madam.

1887
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,673
Pack the DVDs now. Hurry up.

1888
01:44:48,734 --> 01:44:49,872
Yes, I am.

1889
01:44:57,134 --> 01:44:58,374
There she is. - Let's go that way.

1890
01:44:58,534 --> 01:44:59,638
Come on. - Hi.

1891
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,704
<i>Here. . have...</i>

1892
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,276
Here...

1893
01:45:08,834 --> 01:45:12,179
For a special customer. - Ooh la la.

1894
01:45:12,967 --> 01:45:14,105
What are you doing?

1895
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,309
Sir, let me pack it properly.

1896
01:45:16,401 --> 01:45:18,142
I am packing them so sweetly.

1897
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:19,240
Hurry UP-

1898
01:45:21,467 --> 01:45:22,605
Pack it quickly.

1899
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,340
I am, sir.

1900
01:45:24,434 --> 01:45:25,811
If you take any longer...

1901
01:45:25,967 --> 01:45:28,709
...then we'll have to pack up.

1902
01:45:28,901 --> 01:45:31,313
Please, give it to me. - It's done.

1903
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:32,812
Hurry up. - Madam, packing..

1904
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:36,213
Give it. - It will tear.

1905
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:38,477
The DVDs are coming out.

1906
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:48,970
Satyanash. (Curses).

1907
01:45:49,033 --> 01:45:50,103
What? - What?

1908
01:45:50,234 --> 01:45:51,907
Satya Nash, that's my name.

1909
01:45:52,067 --> 01:45:54,240
Your name fits your job.

1910
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:56,211
Bloody villain.
- Shut up you two, shut up!

1911
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,845
That's Kanhaiyya.

1912
01:45:59,434 --> 01:46:08,513
Welcome to Maa Jagat Sajni's court.

1913
01:46:09,767 --> 01:46:12,714
And that's Kanhaiyya's
sister...Sanskar.

1914
01:46:12,767 --> 01:46:13,609
Look there,

1915
01:46:16,734 --> 01:46:18,338
That's Rocky and Kanhaiyya.

1916
01:46:18,434 --> 01:46:19,504
What are they doing?

1917
01:46:19,567 --> 01:46:22,241
What no one ever did in our family?

1918
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:23,945
These DVDs are working.

1919
01:46:24,034 --> 01:46:25,843
I've seen this film 25 times.

1920
01:46:25,934 --> 01:46:26,742
What a performance.

1921
01:46:26,834 --> 01:46:29,246
Why did you bring
these transistors along?

1922
01:46:29,334 --> 01:46:30,005
To play.

1923
01:46:30,167 --> 01:46:31,703
Pervert boys.

1924
01:46:32,534 --> 01:46:35,538
I always knew...he's useless.

1925
01:46:35,734 --> 01:46:37,407
You make it sound as if...

1926
01:46:37,467 --> 01:46:39,640
...you've done big things in life.
- Shut up.

1927
01:46:40,134 --> 01:46:41,875
Blue film actor.

1928
01:46:42,734 --> 01:46:44,907
They turned out to
be uncultured and cheats!

1929
01:46:46,467 --> 01:46:47,707
Do not climb up here.

1930
01:46:47,967 --> 01:46:49,275
This... This...

1931
01:46:49,467 --> 01:46:51,037
Are these your values?

1932
01:46:51,201 --> 01:46:54,182
You really are the family
that sleeps together.

1933
01:46:55,034 --> 01:46:57,344
Tell Kanhaiyya that
I would rather die...

1934
01:46:57,434 --> 01:47:00,278
...then let my daughter marry him.

1935
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,705
Then I should die.

1936
01:47:03,934 --> 01:47:04,878
But..

1937
01:47:04,968 --> 01:47:07,244
Why is Vidya going to commit suicide?

1938
01:47:07,434 --> 01:47:09,243
I canceled Kanhaiyya's wedding.

1939
01:47:09,467 --> 01:47:10,537
It's the same thing.

1940
01:47:12,501 --> 01:47:13,571
Vidya.

1941
01:47:13,834 --> 01:47:15,313
I am coming too.
- Where are you going?

1942
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,038
Get lost. - Wait.

1943
01:47:17,934 --> 01:47:21,939
I guess we'll have
to do a part 4 for him.

1944
01:47:26,367 --> 01:47:27,038
Oh...

1945
01:47:28,434 --> 01:47:29,504
Welcome.

1946
01:47:30,267 --> 01:47:32,611
Stop, Vidya. - I don't want to live.

1947
01:47:34,267 --> 01:47:35,541
Vidya.

1948
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:38,246
Stop. - Stop. Stop.

1949
01:47:38,334 --> 01:47:40,678
Vidya, stop

1950
01:47:41,334 --> 01:47:42,278
Stop.

1951
01:47:42,367 --> 01:47:44,404
Vidya. - Vidya..stop.

1952
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:47,681
I don't want to live. - Stop!

1953
01:47:52,234 --> 01:47:53,542
You.. - Get lost.

1954
01:48:01,601 --> 01:48:03,308
Kanhaiya, stop.

1955
01:48:03,867 --> 01:48:05,904
Vidya, stop.

1956
01:48:07,534 --> 01:48:09,741
I don't want to live. - Listen to me.

1957
01:48:10,034 --> 01:48:11,707
Stop, Kanhaiya.

1958
01:48:12,067 --> 01:48:13,068
Kanhaiya.

1959
01:48:18,201 --> 01:48:20,203
Don't go there!

1960
01:48:20,367 --> 01:48:21,971
That's my son Kanhaiya.

1961
01:48:22,167 --> 01:48:24,841
Kanhaiya. - Stop. Stop.

1962
01:48:26,001 --> 01:48:27,002
I don't want to live.

1963
01:48:40,634 --> 01:48:42,204
I'm sinking in quick sand.

1964
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,802
I'm really going to die.
- I told you not to do it.

1965
01:48:43,867 --> 01:48:45,175
We'll get caught. - Forget that.

1966
01:48:45,267 --> 01:48:46,211
Get me out of this quick sand.

1967
01:48:46,267 --> 01:48:47,268
I don't want to die.

1968
01:48:47,334 --> 01:48:50,338
Get me out of here.
- Give me your hand.

1969
01:48:50,601 --> 01:48:52,911
Oh my, God. I am sinking too.

1970
01:48:52,967 --> 01:48:55,140
Oh my, God. Help. Help, help!

1971
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:56,611
Such a big deceit.

1972
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:58,311
Deceit. Deceit. Deceit.

1973
01:48:58,367 --> 01:48:59,209
This is terrible.

1974
01:48:59,301 --> 01:49:00,075
I am sinking too.

1975
01:49:00,134 --> 01:49:04,742
I was trying to make my
daughter's husband her mother.

1976
01:49:05,501 --> 01:49:07,208
Forget that, we're dying here.

1977
01:49:07,401 --> 01:49:12,111
Kanhaiya, you toyed around
with my heart as well.

1978
01:49:13,134 --> 01:49:16,172
Someone save me.

1979
01:49:17,434 --> 01:49:19,607
Prem, save me.

1980
01:49:19,701 --> 01:49:21,442
I am just a parrot, not God.

1981
01:49:21,667 --> 01:49:23,544
I don't want to die.
Prem, do something.

1982
01:49:23,634 --> 01:49:24,977
Okay, I'll do something

1983
01:49:29,567 --> 01:49:30,773
Aunty, where were you?

1984
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,037
Papa, save me. - Help! Help!

1985
01:49:42,134 --> 01:49:43,112
Someone help him.

1986
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:44,608
Forgive me, son.

1987
01:49:44,734 --> 01:49:46,839
I should be ashamed of myself.

1988
01:49:48,534 --> 01:49:51,481
You were thinking
of making him your wife.

1989
01:49:51,634 --> 01:49:53,238
But me, his father..

1990
01:49:53,301 --> 01:49:56,214
I was thinking of making
him his mother. - Papa..

1991
01:49:57,601 --> 01:50:00,377
That means..you're
Kanhaiya's real father.

1992
01:50:00,434 --> 01:50:01,504
Yes, I am his father.

1993
01:50:01,601 --> 01:50:03,080
But I am a big sinner.

1994
01:50:03,167 --> 01:50:04,475
Then who's this fake father?

1995
01:50:04,601 --> 01:50:06,137
Even his moustache is a fake.

1996
01:50:06,634 --> 01:50:09,638
That's Rocky. Kanhaiya's friend.

1997
01:50:10,267 --> 01:50:11,837
I was so stupid..

1998
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:14,380
I tried to make my son's friend..

1999
01:50:15,634 --> 01:50:18,205
...his father. Help!

2000
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:20,405
Every father thinks..

2001
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,343
...that his son-in-law will be a gem,

2002
01:50:22,567 --> 01:50:24,240
But you're a gem..

2003
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:29,008
...that's been used like
Kohinoor with who knows whom.

2004
01:50:29,167 --> 01:50:30,043
No Kohinoor.

2005
01:50:30,234 --> 01:50:32,544
Whenever we had sex, we used Durex,

2006
01:50:33,967 --> 01:50:37,779
And he didn't do anything wrong if
he showed his anaconda to the world.

2007
01:50:37,934 --> 01:50:40,107
Not every Simran gets his Raj.

2008
01:50:40,167 --> 01:50:41,703
Sometimes we have
to settle for Nagraj.

2009
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:42,642
Here's the Nagraj.

2010
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:47,302
Shalu, we've been deceived.

2011
01:50:47,434 --> 01:50:49,072
Kanhaiya, you're Vidya?

2012
01:50:49,134 --> 01:50:50,772
I did this for you, Shalu.

2013
01:50:51,034 --> 01:50:52,342
Sindoor, stay back.

2014
01:50:52,867 --> 01:50:53,971
Sindoor.

2015
01:50:55,167 --> 01:50:56,202
Sindoor.

2016
01:50:58,567 --> 01:50:59,477
Aunty!

2017
01:51:00,167 --> 01:51:00,804
Please help.

2018
01:51:05,567 --> 01:51:07,376
Hey, Father no.1.

2019
01:51:07,434 --> 01:51:08,913
Come quickly.

2020
01:51:09,034 --> 01:51:10,513
Hey guys, hold on.

2021
01:51:10,867 --> 01:51:13,507
What's Karjatiya's parrot doing here?

2022
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:16,642
Everyone's in danger. Come quickly.

2023
01:51:21,934 --> 01:51:23,572
Helm - Help!

2024
01:51:23,734 --> 01:51:26,442
Somebody help!

2025
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,136
Father.

2026
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:30,509
Kanhaiya. - Help!

2027
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,539
Come on. Quickly.

2028
01:51:36,601 --> 01:51:38,603
Come on, come quickly.

2029
01:51:40,901 --> 01:51:43,814
Kanhaiya, no one's going to die now.

2030
01:51:43,867 --> 01:51:45,505
I'll save everyone.

2031
01:51:45,601 --> 01:51:47,103
Everyone go to hell.

2032
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:49,875
Hey, Comedy Circus, come down quickly.

2033
01:51:49,934 --> 01:51:52,471
One balloon saves you from AIDS..

2034
01:51:52,634 --> 01:51:54,705
...and this balloon
will save your lives.

2035
01:51:54,967 --> 01:51:55,877
Balloon!

2036
01:51:56,067 --> 01:51:56,909
Balloon!

2037
01:51:56,967 --> 01:51:57,968
Balloon!

2038
01:51:58,034 --> 01:52:00,344
Stop screaming and yelling.

2039
01:52:00,467 --> 01:52:02,743
Catch it now or you
won't get a second chance.

2040
01:52:02,934 --> 01:52:03,935
Here you go, Kanhaiya.

2041
01:52:05,201 --> 01:52:05,975
Catch it.

2042
01:52:06,467 --> 01:52:07,878
Catch it, fast.

2043
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:14,577
Yes, father. Carefully.

2044
01:52:15,801 --> 01:52:17,576
Come on, go father.

2045
01:52:20,601 --> 01:52:21,477
Come on father.

2046
01:52:23,034 --> 01:52:24,308
Come on.. Come on.

2047
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:33,279
Brother!

2048
01:52:35,134 --> 01:52:36,306
Sindoor..spoke.

2049
01:52:36,468 --> 01:52:37,344
Aunty?

2050
01:52:39,734 --> 01:52:41,213
Aunty. What just happened?

2051
01:52:41,601 --> 01:52:44,309
Sakru, it's pack up for us.

2052
01:52:45,967 --> 01:52:47,571
Aunty..spoke.

2053
01:52:47,767 --> 01:52:49,508
Aunty..go on.

2054
01:52:49,567 --> 01:52:51,444
Go up, quickly.

2055
01:52:54,534 --> 01:52:57,037
Papa, you go next. - Okay.

2056
01:52:57,900 --> 01:53:00,574
Thank you. Yes.

2057
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:02,301
Son, come up.

2058
01:53:02,434 --> 01:53:03,845
You go first. - No, you go.

2059
01:53:04,001 --> 01:53:05,071
I said you go.

2060
01:53:05,167 --> 01:53:06,874
Are you two crazy,
you're discussing over this.

2061
01:53:07,134 --> 01:53:08,545
It's so windy up here, hurry up.

2062
01:53:08,667 --> 01:53:10,874
Hold on, let's do one thing.
Let's climb up together.

2063
01:53:10,967 --> 01:53:13,470
Because we've done
everything together.

2064
01:53:13,534 --> 01:53:15,207
Let's go. - Come on.

2065
01:53:16,101 --> 01:53:17,102
Kanhaiya, careful.

2066
01:53:17,334 --> 01:53:18,074
Careful.

2067
01:53:22,034 --> 01:53:23,069
Come on, Kanhaiya.

2068
01:53:25,667 --> 01:53:28,511
If you ever show me a sign again..
- Look, another sign.

2069
01:53:28,567 --> 01:53:30,205
Come on, son..take a selfie.

2070
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:32,337
You're always joking around.

2071
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:37,607
Come on, guys.
- Come on, take it up. Take it up.

2072
01:53:38,201 --> 01:53:39,544
We're safe.

2073
01:53:41,867 --> 01:53:44,473
Slowly, don't fall me down.

2074
01:53:44,734 --> 01:53:47,271
Yet I have to see my sons wedding.

2075
01:53:48,801 --> 01:53:50,712
Bless you. Here too.

2076
01:53:51,501 --> 01:53:52,571
God bless you.

2077
01:53:52,734 --> 01:53:54,077
Bless you. Bless you.

2078
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:55,838
What are you doing?

2079
01:53:56,367 --> 01:53:59,007
Friends, please forgive me.

2080
01:53:59,634 --> 01:54:01,272
You all made me realise..

2081
01:54:01,334 --> 01:54:03,075
...that my thinking was so wrong.

2082
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,170
You all took off your clothes..

2083
01:54:06,367 --> 01:54:09,246
But only so that
you can cover your body.

2084
01:54:09,634 --> 01:54:11,614
And anything we do
to make our ends meet.

2085
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:13,338
...can never be a sin.

2086
01:54:13,601 --> 01:54:16,582
By saving us from that quick sand,
you all proved..

2087
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:19,177
...that culture doesn't
come from covering yourself“

2088
01:54:19,434 --> 01:54:21,345
...or taking your clothes off.

2089
01:54:21,567 --> 01:54:23,137
And that's the naked truth.

2090
01:54:23,234 --> 01:54:24,406
Absolutely right, father.

2091
01:54:24,667 --> 01:54:26,112
That's been my thinking all along.

2092
01:54:26,667 --> 01:54:27,975
If you respect a girl..

2093
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:29,677
“Only then will
she give you in return.

2094
01:54:29,767 --> 01:54:30,507
What?

2095
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,079
What's he saying? - No, no.

2096
01:54:32,134 --> 01:54:34,705
He means to say "She'll
respect you back".

2097
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:36,677
Yeah. - Correct.

2098
01:54:36,734 --> 01:54:40,272
And now we've decided
to make only family films.

2099
01:54:40,334 --> 01:54:40,937
Really.

2100
01:54:41,068 --> 01:54:43,548
Movies that families
can sit together and watch.

2101
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:47,603
Kanhaiya, your eyes are normal
even after seeing red? - Yes.

2102
01:54:47,867 --> 01:54:48,971
How did this miracle happen?

2103
01:54:49,067 --> 01:54:51,172
That's because with great difficulty..

2104
01:54:51,334 --> 01:54:53,575
...I finally found true love, Rocky.

2105
01:54:53,767 --> 01:54:55,542
Yes! Yes!

2106
01:54:55,667 --> 01:54:58,773
This is called Happy Ending!

2107
01:54:58,834 --> 01:54:59,676
Happy ending.

2108
01:54:59,767 --> 01:55:01,804
We're experts in happy ending.

2109
01:55:02,167 --> 01:55:04,272
Hold on. It's not that
kind of happy ending.

2110
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:05,738
This Happy Ending-

2111
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:11,907
Happy Ending!

2112
01:55:13,034 --> 01:55:14,104
"How cool are we."

2113
01:55:14,201 --> 01:55:19,275
"How cool are we."

2114
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:24,704
"How.."
