Don't move, don't breathe.

28
00:04:03,529 --> 00:04:04,928
What's wrong, Sir-ji?

29
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,326
Look, look ahead.
Do you see anything?

30
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:17,283
Dead bodies, anything?

31
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:21,607
- No, Sir-ji.
- Somebody blew up an empty shikara.

32
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,838
Idiot!

33
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,078
What are you standing on?

34
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,720
- On a plank, Sir-ji.
- What's under it?

35
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,479
- Some wires, Sir-ji.
- Want to know what it is, "Sir-ji?"

36
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,322
You're standing on an IED.

37
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:44,639
Know what will happen if you move?
You will be blown to bits.

38
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:49,242
- Head there, legs here.
- I'm sorry, Sir-ji.

39
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:51,718
Fool! You run ahead of your wits.

40
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:55,639
- Avinash, everyone out. Out!
- Come on, out!

41
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,041
- Avinash, out!
- Yes, sir.

42
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:07,760
- Scared, Gurdeep?
- I'm remembering my God, Sir-ji.

43
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,048
- Sir-ji?
- Yes.

44
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:13,523
I need to pee.

45
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:15,724
So, pee.

46
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:17,878
Without moving.

47
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:25,607
- Done?
- Yes, Sir-ji.

48
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:27,528
- Feel lighter?
- Yes, Sir-ji.

49
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,364
Good. Now jump so fast
that before the bomb bursts...

50
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:33,719
...you hit the water.
- I can't swim, Sir-ji.

51
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:41,638
- Then you're done for, "Sir-ji."
- Really, Sir-ji?

52
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:44,084
- I can't save you.
- What are you saying, Sir-ji?

53
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,885
- No way out?
- None whatsoever.

54
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:50,128
- Avinash.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:52,807
Tell all these men to step back.

56
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:57,202
- Lf something happens, sir...
- Take care of this.

57
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,759
It's not police property,
it's my own. Now, move.

58
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:01,517
Move!

59
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:08,518
Down!

60
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,082
Come, Gurdeep.

61
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:47,759
You're great, sir.

62
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:49,680
No talk of my greatness to Nilu, okay?

63
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,402
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

64
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:04,037
Why must you always be the hero?
If something had happened...

65
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:06,888
What could I do? Let my man die?

66
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,843
If not of yourself,
think of Neelima and Irfan.

67
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,843
If Neelima finds out,
she'll hang you.

68
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,199
Not me, friend. You're the one in trouble.

69
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,088
- Me? Why?
- Why weren't you at Irfan's birthday?

70
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:20,839
You know what a doctor's life is.

71
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,648
With this new spate of firecrackers
in Kashmir...

72
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:26,768
...a dozen or so like you
show up to be treated daily.

73
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:30,645
Present this defence to Neelima.
You are to come to Sunday lunch.

74
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,841
That's her fatwa.

75
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,682
Yet another fatwa to be observed.

76
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,283
This is the season of fatwas in Kashmir.

77
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:41,767
There's one issued by Malik-ul-Khan:

78
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:47,289
"Any doctor who treats a policeman
will be transferred directly to God."

79
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:50,799
I'll kill Malik-ul-Khan a hundred times
before he dares to touch you.

80
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:54,122
For now, protect yourself
by being on time for Sunday's lunch.

81
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:55,319
Good-bye.

82
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:57,161
- Good-bye.
- Come, Avinash.

83
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:02,921
Allah! Your heart is going, boom-boom.

84
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,481
Pardon my insolence, Madam Doctor,
my heart isn't there. It is here.

85
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,920
Where is this sound coming from?

86
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:14,007
My stomach growling with hunger.

87
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:19,246
As if I'm keeping you hungry.
Dinner is ready.

88
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:24,358
You go eat. I'll tell the patients that
Doctor-saab will be with them shortly.

89
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,084
No, it could be an emergency.

90
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:30,883
- Greetings, Dr. Akhtar.
- Please come in.

91
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:33,805
Would the patient sit here, please?

92
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:35,597
What's the problem?

93
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:39,921
What can I say, Doctor-saab?
A strange passion has overcome me.

94
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,285
I know neither hunger nor thirst.

95
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,838
Only one word rings in my ears:

96
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:50,122
Freedom, freedom, freedom.

97
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:55,399
Look, I'm a doctor.
How am I to help you in this...

98
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:56,638
You could have...

99
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:58,877
...but you didn't.

100
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:02,723
I am saddened
that educated people like you...

101
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:06,443
...treat Kashmir's independence
with such indifference.

102
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:08,841
Sorry, have we met before?

103
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:13,483
- You don't recognize me?
- No.

104
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:16,559
You don't recognize me?

105
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:18,444
Look!

106
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,118
Saw?

107
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:23,359
He's Malik-ul-Khan, you traitor.

108
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,441
It's his home.

109
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:30,364
Let it be.

110
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:35,685
So you didn't recognize me
but you knew of my fatwa.

111
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:41,767
Then why did you treat SSP Khan?

112
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:45,325
I'm a doctor. To treat the sick is my duty.

113
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:46,205
Duty, is it?

114
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:49,159
God have mercy!

115
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:55,406
See what Dr. Akhtar made me do?

116
00:09:57,689 --> 00:09:59,839
I walked 40 miles to meet him.

117
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:02,567
If I took no action...

118
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:04,688
...then people would say:

119
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:06,800
"Malik-ul-Khan just talks...

120
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:10,481
"...the way politicians do.
He doesn't act."

121
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:13,808
What could I do?

122
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:17,487
Kashmir's independence demands martyrs.

123
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:33,359
Irfan!

124
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:34,723
Yes, Mrs. Khan.

125
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:38,001
What are you doing up there?
Come down.

126
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:41,640
- Okay, I will.
- Irfan, what are you doing?

127
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:44,197
- I'm coming down.
- Not that way. Go inside.

128
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:47,839
You told me to come down,
so that's what I'm doing.

129
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:52,480
- From inside! Irfan, please.
- Don't worry, Ammi. I'm strong.

130
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:55,044
- You'll fall, Son.
- I won't, Ammi.

131
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,881
No, Son, go in.

132
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,398
- Ammi!
- Irfan!

133
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:15,118
- Irfan, open your eyes.
- I'm all right.

134
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,559
- Talk to me, Son.
- I'm fine, Ammi.

135
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,002
Are you okay, Son?

136
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:27,881
The patient's condition is serious.

137
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:32,845
Khan-saab. Khan-saab.

138
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:36,365
He's fine. It's just a bruise.
The doctor will tend to it.

139
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:39,441
How? The doctor refuses
to even touch him.

140
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:45,124
- Doctor, my son Irfan.
- I'm sorry. Malik-ul-Khan's fatwa...

141
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,808
You're safe. I'll see that
the whole police force protects you.

142
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,164
Please treat my son.

143
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:53,719
You know Dr. Akhtar's fate.
I can't take the risk. Malik-ul-Khan...

144
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:57,484
Before Malik-ul-Khan gets to you,
I'll kill you myself!

145
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:01,520
Go ahead. Kill me.
At least my family will be saved.

146
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:07,528
They don't even spare wives and children.

147
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:12,518
Irfan, open your eyes. Irfan!

148
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,808
What are you doing?

149
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:32,129
- Where's the ICU?
- Straight ahead, first right.

150
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,446
He's not opening his eyes!

151
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,240
Nobody is here! Where are the doctors?

152
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:40,285
Nurse! Nurse!

153
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,400
- Where are the doctors?
- Nobody's on duty.

154
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:46,208
- Please do something.
- Nothing will happen, nothing.

155
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:55,405
Doctor, my son is badly hurt.
He fell from a window and injured his head.

156
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:57,048
Please check him.

157
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:58,603
Sir, the fatwa?

158
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:07,400
Everything will be fine.

159
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,008
I'm sorry, Mr. Khan.

160
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,966
- What happened?
- Nothing.

161
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:26,162
What has happened to my son?

162
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:28,320
Why did you turn off the light?

163
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,842
Nurse, put on the light! Put the lights on!

164
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,361
Khan-saab, wake him. Please.

165
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:55,686
"Sleep, my lovely moonchild
Sleep, my prince

166
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:58,682
"Come to the world of dreams

167
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:02,999
"The sleep fairies are here

168
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,764
"wearing anklets on their feet

172
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:44,885
Our informer says Malik-ul-Khan's men
were seen near Hazratbal last evening.

173
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:48,047
Today, not long ago,
they moved north in shikaras.

174
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,563
There's a wedding in this village.

175
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,967
If he stops there tonight, we can cover him
from here, cordon him off...

176
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:58,246
...approach over the water and get him.

177
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:01,639
I'm certain that Malik-ul-Khan
will spend the night in this village.

178
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:32,365
"Bumblebee, dark-hued bumblebee

179
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:36,245
"What garden do you come from?"

180
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:42,326
- Where is Altaaf?
- Over there.

181
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:46,599
"Bumblebee, dark-hued bumblebee

182
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:49,806
"What garden do you come from?"

183
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:07,720
Altaaf, you here alone? I'm dancing
over there and you are painting over here?

184
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:15,326
The song will be over soon.
Come on, Altaaf.

185
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:17,446
Or I won't talk to you.

186
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:21,127
Come on, you can paint anytime.

187
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:22,724
Come on.

188
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,246
What are you looking at, son? The guns?

189
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,599
Who is this drenched prince?

190
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,203
My son, Altaaf.

191
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:05,880
Altaaf.

192
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:09,439
I'm Sufi, Sufiya Parvez. What's your name?

193
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:13,607
You don't know me?

194
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,728
Malik-ul-Khan is my name,
soldier for Kashmir's independence.

195
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:21,201
- You've heard of me, yes?
- Sufi, go home. It's late.

196
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,679
- But Altaaf and l...
- Listen to your elders. Go.

197
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:26,761
Child, come here.

198
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:29,161
Come to me.

199
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:30,762
Come. Sit.

200
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:35,087
What are you looking at?

201
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:38,040
It's called a Kalashnikov, child.

202
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:42,483
These are all toys.
There's great fun in this game.

203
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:44,768
Want to play?

204
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:46,642
You won't play?

205
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:49,082
Come, play.

206
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,479
No?

207
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:14,483
- Come here, kids.
- What is it?

208
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:15,917
Come quickly.

209
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,684
- Here, firecrackers.
- Give me some.

210
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,485
- Me, too.
- Sure, here.

211
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:24,765
- I'll set off the first one.
- No, I will.

212
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,442
Let's all do it together.

213
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:36,687
The food is really tasty.

214
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:41,328
Did you cook so well out of love for us
or in fear of our guns?

215
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:53,877
It's the wedding.
They're setting off firecrackers.

216
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,721
We are at a feast, too.

217
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:58,922
Except we are uninvited guests
at Nazir Hassan's.

218
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:17,199
- Ammi, can we go out to play?
- Absolutely not.

219
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:22,921
Let them, Madam. In the joy of children
we hear nature's laughter.

220
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,405
Go, children, play.

221
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,285
Brother, I forgot my doll.

222
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:03,999
I just blindly killed
whoever came in my way.

223
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:09,521
Who was a militant, who was not,
I couldn't see anything.

224
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,485
You didn't do it knowingly.

225
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:16,523
In your place,
maybe I'd have done the same.

226
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:22,002
I sometimes think:

227
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:26,761
"Why did I pull on that vine?"

228
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,122
If I had let him play...

229
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,161
...today Irfan would be here, with us.

230
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,485
I was the one who took his life.

231
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:42,528
I killed him.

232
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:47,121
Not knowingly, Nilu.

233
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:49,687
I'm sorry.

234
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:53,442
I'm sorry.

235
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:03,967
Where is that boy?

236
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:08,121
Can't we bring him to our home?

237
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:17,205
He didn't see you.

238
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,966
He was staring at me.

239
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:26,162
Your face was covered by a mask.

240
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:30,284
It could be anyone behind that mask.
Anybody. Not you.

241
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:38,799
Listen. God has given us an opportunity.
He'll have a home and...

242
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:41,246
...we'll find our son.

243
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:47,038
We'll get a son, but how?
Through a lie? Through deceit?

244
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,088
By hiding from him that I killed
his mother and father?

245
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:51,841
That I robbed him of everything?

246
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:55,724
- What are you saying?
- We'll only have to lie if he asks.

247
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:57,962
At least bring him home.

248
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:02,882
What he's lost, I'll restore to him.
I'll love him more...

249
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:09,318
...than I loved Irfan.
More than his own parents did.

250
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:12,960
He won't lack anything.

251
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:16,921
And we won't deceive him.

252
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,964
When he's older, able to understand...

253
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:24,245
...we'll tell him the truth. Everything.

254
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:30,641
Please. Bring him here.

255
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:48,567
The child's traumatized,
hasn't spoken or eaten for two days.

256
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:50,321
He has no surviving relatives.

257
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:53,446
He's in deep shock.
It seems like he can't hear anything either.

258
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:57,840
- Where's the boy?
- Locked in the cell.

259
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:01,319
You hold a child in a cell, you fool?

260
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:02,718
Sorry, Sir-ji.

261
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:29,362
Altaaf.

262
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:37,599
Let's go, son.

263
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:57,205
What's your name?

264
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:09,324
If you don't tell us,
you think we won't find out?

265
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:13,920
Altaaf is your name, right?

266
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:24,563
Come, I'll show you your room.

267
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:01,679
Altaaf, eat some coconut biscuits.

268
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:04,921
Khan-saab brought them.

269
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:14,444
He used to bring coconut biscuits
every day. He loved them.

270
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:18,603
He'd run to the door and grab them
from Khan-saab.

271
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:25,447
He'd play cricket in the garden.
Morning to evening...

272
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:29,725
...not stopping even when I scolded him.

273
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:33,448
I'd call him for dinner.
He'd say, "I'll eat later."

274
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:41,599
He'd say,
"Ammi, let me play or I'll run away."

275
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:47,566
Now he's run so far away...

276
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:51,166
...that he'll never come back.

277
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:03,406
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

278
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:11,326
Here, let me.

279
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,327
What was his name?

280
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:22,197
Irfan.

281
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:27,041
Is this his shirt?

282
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:35,005
Did he sit here?

283
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,558
No.

284
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:40,924
Here.

285
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,768
Next to me.

286
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:10,558
"Sleep, my lovely moonchild
Sleep, my prince

287
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,924
"Come to the world of dreams

288
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:18,197
"The sleep fairies are here

289
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,281
"wearing anklets on their feet

290
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:25,724
"They'll waft you away

291
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:28,403
"on their soft wings

292
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:34,841
"for a stroll in the land of sleep

293
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:06,237
"These beauties who dazzle heaven

294
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:12,927
"In their land you'll be a guest

295
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:20,924
"And they'll tell you new stories

296
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:27,607
"and dance and sing with you

297
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:33,445
"Sleep, my lovely moonchild
Sleep, my prince

298
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:36,966
"Come to the world of dreams

299
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,198
"The sleep fairies are here

300
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:44,122
"wearing anklets on their feet

"for a stroll in the land of sleep"

304
00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:57,918
Then?

305
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:00,802
Then, I don't remember when I fell asleep.

306
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:08,042
We aren't able to forget Irfan.

307
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:12,198
Altaaf is a child.
How can he forget what happened?

308
00:32:13,969 --> 00:32:17,598
He won't until we put aside our grief.

309
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:22,163
- It's not that easy, Nilu.
- Maybe, but...

310
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:26,082
...it's not forgotten.

311
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:30,321
It's just hidden.

312
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:38,242
Sweet, isn't he?
He was just 5 months old.

313
00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:43,405
However much I combed his hair,
it never stayed in place. Madcap!

314
00:32:43,969 --> 00:32:49,965
"Far from this earth
somewhere across the seven seas

315
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:58,117
"Amidst distant skies
is the world of dreams

316
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:05,808
"That is the land of love
where there is love, only love

317
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:10,164
"My darling moon, go there
The fairies are waiting for you"

318
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:12,558
I kept this for you to see.

319
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:17,800
Sweet, isn't it? A snow-covered field,
a wooden bridge, a pink house.

320
00:33:26,969 --> 00:33:28,846
Why is your name Neelima?

321
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:32,125
Why not? My mother gave it to me.

322
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:34,645
- But it's a Hindu name.
- Yes.

323
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:38,323
She is a Hindu.

324
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:40,719
Then how did you get married?

325
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:43,323
Like everyone else.

326
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:46,278
Come here.

327
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:52,803
If her name wasn't Neelima but Salma,
would she be different?

328
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:59,084
I loved her and I married her,
not her name or her religion.

329
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:01,278
Was I wrong?

330
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:03,882
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

331
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:20,278
You're out.

332
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:22,528
Go and bowl, kid.

333
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:24,488
Abba is cheating, Ammi.

334
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,323
You're out. Give me the bat.

335
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:30,804
You're out.

336
00:34:31,209 --> 00:34:33,359
- What did you say?
- You're cheating.

337
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:36,084
- Before that.
- You're out. Let go!

338
00:34:36,249 --> 00:34:38,444
- What did you tell Ammi?
- To Ammi?

339
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:41,322
- That you're cheating.
- Before that, Altaaf.

340
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:43,599
Why do you keep asking? Let go.

341
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:46,959
Abba, bowl!

342
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:50,400
Abba, whose face are you gawking at?

343
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:57,886
Abba, bowl!

344
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:00,528
I'm not out!

345
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:06,201
Do you know anything about cricket?

346
00:35:07,249 --> 00:35:09,365
I'm not out. I'll tell Ammi.

347
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:18,521
- You're out, Son.
- I won't talk to you anymore.

348
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:23,440
Ammi, tell Abba to bowl.

349
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:25,201
Are you dreaming?

350
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,167
Altaaf has been asking you to bowl.

351
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:31,968
Abba, bowl. Go on!

352
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:38,481
Today he called me Abba.

353
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,517
Six months after calling me Ammi.

354
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:44,889
So what? At least he said, "Abba."

355
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:51,119
You know, when he said that,
I remembered Irfan.

356
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:54,128
And then?

357
00:35:56,009 --> 00:35:57,442
You came.

358
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:02,642
Then?

359
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:04,688
Then what?

360
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:06,477
Then...

361
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:01,524
This is the first time
we've left Altaaf alone.

362
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:03,486
I wonder if he's eaten or not.

363
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:07,445
- He must have. Don't worry.
- We were out too late.

364
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,083
Maybe he's sleeping.

365
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:08,649
Next time, we'll take him with us.

366
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:33,928
Nilu, my revolver?

367
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:54,361
What are you doing?

368
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:15,677
Hilal. Hilal Kohistani.

369
00:40:16,529 --> 00:40:19,089
- And he is Hamid.
- Rampuria.

370
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:22,169
No, sir. I'm from Muradabad.

371
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:24,286
Both are in India, anyway.

372
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:26,844
They say that in Afghanistan...

373
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,762
...when the Soviets heard your name,
they fled their tanks?

374
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:33,000
Never mind names. Let's talk about work.

375
00:40:34,729 --> 00:40:36,003
Mission Kashmir.

376
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:38,366
- This task...
- Will be done.

377
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:41,839
- Price?
- Don't worry about money.

378
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:46,199
You execute our mission and
we'll pay any price you demand.

379
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:50,726
Since 1947, all the attacks on India
have been government-organized.

380
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:55,242
We owe allegiance to no government.
We're an independent group.

381
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:57,127
We are soldiers for freedom.

382
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:00,008
More Muslims live in India
than in Pakistan.

383
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:04,721
Once our mission succeeds,
they too will join us in our jihad.

384
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:07,486
And our unknown group will become...

385
00:41:07,689 --> 00:41:11,045
...the most illustrious of mujahideen militia
the world over.

386
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:17,047
In 1971, India changed the map of Asia.
Now, we'll change the shape of India.

387
00:41:17,969 --> 00:41:21,086
A great victory entails a great sacrifice.

388
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:24,208
The reward is great too, God willing.

389
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:26,723
Ten million...

390
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:29,679
...dollars.

391
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:31,003
Twenty million.

392
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:36,208
To give money for jihad
is as virtuous as giving alms.

393
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:41,086
But even the name of this mission
can't go beyond these walls, Hilal.

394
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:45,439
Secrets buried in a Pathan's heart
don't emerge even on Judgment Day.

395
00:41:46,689 --> 00:41:48,441
You take care of your people.

396
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:50,839
We've organized arms and ammunition.

397
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:55,800
TV camera, tapes and technical support
will be provided as needed.

398
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:58,127
If you need anything else...

399
00:41:58,409 --> 00:42:02,004
I need a companion
who isn't afraid of death.

400
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:05,603
Who so despises his own existence...

401
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:09,682
...that I can fire him like a missile...

402
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,287
...to destroy the target and himself.

403
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:15,760
- A man like that...
- I have such a man.

404
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,445
My child...

405
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:22,768
...Altaaf.

406
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,888
And where is your Altaaf now?

407
00:42:27,689 --> 00:42:31,204
Crossing the border into India.

408
00:43:55,809 --> 00:43:57,401
Don't take my life.

409
00:43:57,489 --> 00:44:02,119
I don't want your life,
only your Jeep and wireless.

410
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:05,404
And, yes...

411
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:15,204
...thank you.

412
00:44:24,049 --> 00:44:26,688
I'm from the BSF check post
to meet SSP Khan.

413
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:29,841
You mean IG, saab? Upstairs, to the right.

414
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:31,243
Thank you.

415
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:44,478
The STF Army coordination meeting
is postponed.

416
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:47,003
Go to Kothibag station
and meet the officer there.

417
00:44:52,729 --> 00:44:55,197
- I'm here to meet IG Khan.
- Yes, sir.

418
00:45:55,129 --> 00:45:56,960
- Who was he?
- A BSF guy, sir.

419
00:45:57,049 --> 00:46:00,086
They're ten years behind the times.
Came to meet SSP Khan!

420
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:01,883
SSP Khan?

421
00:46:16,289 --> 00:46:17,404
Stop it! Stop it!

422
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,442
- You okay?
- Double-okay. Just a scratch, Sir-ji.

423
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:32,642
Why are you sitting in the dark?
What happened?

424
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:36,248
Altaaf is back.

425
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:40,801
Altaaf? Where is he? How is he?

426
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:44,449
He must have grown up.
How does he look?

427
00:46:47,969 --> 00:46:49,960
- I didn't see him.
- Why?

428
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,600
He was wearing a mask.

429
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:55,408
Mask?

430
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,128
He was the man...

431
00:46:57,329 --> 00:46:59,240
...who shot at me today.

432
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:02,037
How do you know it was Altaaf?

433
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:07,567
His eyes, the same eyes.

434
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:12,162
He's a child, blinded by anger.

435
00:47:13,529 --> 00:47:16,202
- His heart is broken.
- I know, Nilu.

436
00:47:17,649 --> 00:47:20,163
I'm the one who broke it.

437
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:23,641
Stand straight, all of you.

438
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:27,438
You all look like you're real Indian soldiers.
Kabus, you look good.

439
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:28,724
Cut the jokes.

440
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:31,278
Can't you see I'm working? Later.

441
00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:33,719
- Hey, Number-man.
- Yes?

442
00:47:33,969 --> 00:47:37,200
Change vehicles, not just number-plates,
or you'll get caught one day.

443
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:38,563
Kahvah?

444
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:41,884
No, thank you.

445
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:43,197
Bilal, kahvah?

446
00:47:44,009 --> 00:47:46,239
- Sadiq, kahvah?
- Don't want any.

447
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:51,600
Altaaf-bhai, kahvah for you?

448
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:55,164
It's not from Muzafarbad.
Ghafoor made it.

449
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:56,921
Drink it and be renewed.

450
00:47:58,769 --> 00:48:00,487
- Muhammed, kahvah?
- Later.

451
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:05,040
Mushtaq, got a letter?

452
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:09,561
First, they shamed my mother.
So I picked up a gun and came here.

453
00:48:09,729 --> 00:48:12,960
Now across the border
they have done the same with my sister.

454
00:48:13,129 --> 00:48:15,324
- Courage, Mushtaq.
- Bashir, kahvah?

455
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:16,399
No.

456
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:17,399
Hashim, kahvah?

457
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:20,328
- I don't want your kahvah!
- You like nothing, man.

458
00:48:21,049 --> 00:48:23,165
Sadiq, why do you keep weeping?

459
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:27,725
Instead of boring athletics,
watch some song and dance.

460
00:48:28,529 --> 00:48:31,919
Khan is on TV.
Altaaf-bhai, Khan is on TV.

461
00:48:34,169 --> 00:48:36,763
I want to tell those misguided
young men just this:

462
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:39,285
Throw away your guns...

463
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:41,605
...and return to your homes.

464
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:45,246
Because we don't want
any Kashmiri mother...

465
00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:47,240
...to suffer the loss of a son again.

466
00:48:47,649 --> 00:48:51,358
But the uniforms of the police are
stained with blood too, Khan-saab.

467
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:56,359
If our police force picks up guns,
it is only to save Kashmir.

468
00:48:57,489 --> 00:49:00,959
On June 23, 1989, at Dalgate...

469
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:07,368
...your task force killed a whole family
to nab one militant.

470
00:49:07,889 --> 00:49:11,040
A 6-year-old girl was also killed.
Do you recall that, sir?

471
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:15,477
When bullets are flying at you,
you are forced to fire back.

472
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:17,527
That's all I have to say.

473
00:49:19,449 --> 00:49:21,246
Thank you, Mr. Khan.

474
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:25,880
We were talking to Kashmir Police's
IG Inayat Khan...

475
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:29,002
...who was recently the target
of a terrorist attack.

476
00:49:29,529 --> 00:49:31,838
From Kashmir Today,
I am Sufiya Parvez.

477
00:49:37,649 --> 00:49:38,525
Sufi.

478
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:42,602
This is the Srinagar Centre
of All India Radio, and I am Sufiya Parvez.

479
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:46,045
Altaafl What are you doing there?
The program is starting and you...

480
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:48,165
If we are all in the program,
who'll watch?

481
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:50,445
All right, don't comel Forget itl

482
00:49:50,689 --> 00:49:52,919
Today, on our musical program...

483
00:49:53,209 --> 00:49:55,006
...you'll hear the Kashmiri folk song
Bumblebee.

484
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:15,367
"Bumblebee, dark-hued bumblebee"

485
00:50:15,729 --> 00:50:17,606
I've come to meet Sufiya Parvez.

486
00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:21,677
"What garden do you come from?"

487
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:25,407
Take off the jacket.

488
00:50:26,249 --> 00:50:29,241
"Bumblebee, dark-hued bumblebee

489
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:36,006
"What garden do you come from?"

490
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:39,561
Take off your jacket!

491
00:50:39,649 --> 00:50:41,321
"Bumblebee, black bumblebee

492
00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:42,928
"You bring happiness with you

493
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:46,161
"On this wedding night
you come bearing gifts

"Yes, the henna has bloomed red

502
00:52:04,569 --> 00:52:07,606
"This is the colour of sunlight
the colour of shadows

503
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:11,125
"This is not the colour of henna
It's the colour of a mother's blessing

504
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:14,246
"The colour of this henna is true
All others are false

505
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:17,361

00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:32,326
"They all asked for blessings
which the Lord gladly gave

519
00:53:32,569 --> 00:53:35,527
"Is this henna on our hands
or the red glow of evening?

520
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:38,920
"This wondrous night comes
bringing the moon and the stars"

521
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:08,967
- Who are you? Why are you here?
- You called me.

522
00:54:10,009 --> 00:54:13,126
Me? Are you crazy?
When did I call you?

523
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:16,926
Some nine or ten years ago.
How quickly you forget.

524
00:54:17,529 --> 00:54:19,281
Nine or ten years ago?

525
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:23,802
I said, "If we are all in the program,
who'll watch?"

526
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:30,646
Forgive me, Sufi, I'm a little late in coming.

527
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:34,522
Altaaf?

528
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:57,481
This is Sufi Parvez's office.

529
00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:00,247
Like it? Lovely, yes?

530
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:04,242
Srinagar TV's director was chief guest
at my college's annual function.

531
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:06,719
Like everyone, he loved my dancing.

532
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:09,528
On stage, when he handed me
the first prize...

533
00:55:09,689 --> 00:55:11,919
...I started chatting with him.
And he said:

534
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:15,081
"Sufi, you have as much zip in your talk
as zap in your dance."

535
00:55:15,249 --> 00:55:16,477
I said, "That's true."

536
00:55:16,569 --> 00:55:21,689
He said, "Why not work at our TV station?"
I said yes, so here I am.

537
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:25,848
From that day on,
Srinagar TV is Sufiya Parvez!

538
00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:29,078
Stop staring at yourself and look at this.

539
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:30,438
Abba and Ammi.

540
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:36,159
They looked all over for you.

541
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:39,968
When they couldn't find you,
they told me that...

542
00:55:41,289 --> 00:55:43,757
But I never believed them.
I knew that as long as...

543
00:55:43,889 --> 00:55:45,925
...Shankracharya and
Hazratbal were intact...

544
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,920
...nothing could happen to my Altaaf.

545
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:50,598
Still standing? Why don't you sit?

546
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:56,087
Sir, this is Sufiya Parvez's chair.
Tell me, where did you go off to?

547
00:55:57,209 --> 00:55:59,245
I didn't go anywhere. The police took me.

548
00:55:59,729 --> 00:56:00,718
To jail?

549
00:56:01,409 --> 00:56:02,728
An orphanage.

550
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:06,406
Then a police officer took me home
as his adopted son.

551
00:56:06,649 --> 00:56:08,287
Why didn't you visit me?

552
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:12,203
I was going to, but that very week
he was transferred to Assam.

553
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:14,920
Why didn't you write to me?

554
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:18,642
I did. I wrote many letters...

555
00:56:20,689 --> 00:56:23,249
...some on paper, some in my heart.

556
00:56:25,209 --> 00:56:26,562
But I couldn't mail them.

557
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:29,641
Why? No post office in your Assam?

558
00:56:31,449 --> 00:56:35,761
I was afraid. What if there was no reply?

559
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:37,044
Then?

560
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:39,167
I'd have thought that you...

561
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:41,725
That Sufi had died and gone to heaven?

562
00:56:42,049 --> 00:56:44,768
Even if I'd gone to heaven,
I'd have left you my address.

563
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,844
There's another place people go
besides heaven...

564
00:56:48,569 --> 00:56:52,084
To hell? I'd never go there.

565
00:56:52,729 --> 00:56:54,924
You worry about yourself.
Show me your hand.

566
00:56:55,009 --> 00:56:55,759
My hand?

567
00:56:56,969 --> 00:56:59,085
I won't bite it, I'll just read it.

568
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:01,803
Don't read it.

569
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:05,198
Do you fear your future tomorrows?

570
00:57:06,529 --> 00:57:10,966
No, my desolate yesterdays. My hell.

571
00:57:12,489 --> 00:57:16,880
Why talk like that? Now that
you're here, I'll take you back...

572
00:57:17,409 --> 00:57:21,607
...to our childhood in a shikara.
And heaven will return.

573
00:58:08,129 --> 00:58:09,926
You also used to run, Sadiq?

574
00:58:10,009 --> 00:58:13,479
Cross-country. No one was faster
than me in the entire valley...

575
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:17,365
...perhaps in all of India.
But I couldn't run for Kashmir.

576
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:18,726
Why?

577
00:58:20,169 --> 00:58:21,761
Because...

578
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:26,841
...I couldn't run faster than a bullet.

579
00:58:27,649 --> 00:58:29,958
Stop it, guys, it's midnight.

580
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:33,083
Sorry, Zubair-bhai,
I was watching the race.

581
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:37,927
Patience. I'll shoot your face,
put it on the winner's body.

582
00:58:38,329 --> 00:58:41,446
You can watch that endlessly
and be happy. Now be quiet.

583
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:44,437
Zubair-bhai, you sleep
with your camera beside you?

584
00:58:44,609 --> 00:58:47,442
Why not? Don't you sleep
with your missile?

585
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:50,442
You're an expert at missiles.
I'm expert with films.

586
00:58:50,649 --> 00:58:54,437
Wars aren't won only by missiles.
They're won by cameras, too.

587
00:58:56,569 --> 00:58:57,126
How?

588
00:58:57,209 --> 00:58:59,677
You'll see my miracles
when we win our great victory.

589
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,122
Now let me sleep, buddy.

590
00:59:01,209 --> 00:59:04,360
- Good night, Altaaf-bhai.
- Good night, Sadiq.

591
00:59:14,249 --> 00:59:16,285
Altaaf! What's wrong?

592
00:59:17,049 --> 00:59:18,004
Nothing.

593
00:59:19,409 --> 00:59:23,243
- You're hiding something from me.
- Hiding? No.

594
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:29,322
Sir, my name is Sufiya Parvez and
nobody can hide anything from me.

595
00:59:30,169 --> 00:59:32,729
Sufi, believe me, I'm not hiding anything.

596
00:59:32,929 --> 00:59:35,238
Oh, go on, tell me.

597
00:59:35,729 --> 00:59:38,641
Give your tragedy to me, sir.

598
00:59:40,169 --> 00:59:41,397
You know, Sufi...

599
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,048
...after ten years you are sitting
in front of me...

600
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:49,445
...you're near me...

601
00:59:50,649 --> 00:59:52,560
...but I can't feel your presence.

602
00:59:54,449 --> 00:59:56,565
After ten years, I am in a shikara...

603
00:59:58,009 --> 01:00:00,000
...but I don't feel anything.

604
01:00:02,009 --> 01:00:04,204
There is such beauty all around...

605
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:06,728
...but I can't see it.

606
01:00:07,969 --> 01:00:09,322
What do you see?

607
01:00:09,849 --> 01:00:11,726
I see smoke, Sufi...

608
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:14,324
...all around me.

609
01:00:16,209 --> 01:00:18,803
And in the smoke, bullets fired blindly.

610
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:21,678
People dying. Their screams.

611
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:26,077
Corpses, shards of flesh and bone.
A disembodied head...

612
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:30,199
Look with my eyes, Altaaf.

613
01:00:31,009 --> 01:00:32,362
Listen with my ears.

614
01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:36,609
Listen to the sound of the oars.

615
01:00:54,529 --> 01:00:59,125
"Listen quietly to the beat of this moment

616
01:00:59,809 --> 01:01:03,927
"In this moment is life
All of it

617
01:01:08,169 --> 01:01:12,959
"The world of dreams is right here

618
01:01:13,609 --> 01:01:16,726
"Look with my eyes

619
01:01:24,169 --> 01:01:28,799
"Listen quietly to the beat of this moment

620
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:32,481
"In this moment is life
All of it

621
01:01:34,569 --> 01:01:39,689
"The world of dreams is right here

622
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:43,678
"Look with my eyes

623
01:01:45,249 --> 01:01:49,879
"The dense smoke is parting

624
01:01:50,529 --> 01:01:52,326
"The fog is lifting

625
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:54,406
"Look, now the light of heaven

626
01:01:54,569 --> 01:01:55,888
"falls everywhere

627
01:01:56,569 --> 01:02:00,847
"The glowing earth, the blue sky

628
01:02:01,569 --> 01:02:05,767
"A shikara floating on the waters

629
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:11,519
"The world of dreams is right here

630
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:14,757
"I saw it with your eyes

631
01:02:17,649 --> 01:02:21,767
"Listen quietly to the beat of this moment

632
01:03:03,049 --> 01:03:07,600
"Love has worked its strange magic on me

633
01:03:08,009 --> 01:03:12,799
"My gaze doesn't move from your face

634
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,042
"Nobody is here but us

635
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:18,444
"Only this feeling of love

636
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:21,517
"A sudden gust of fragrance perfumes us

637
01:03:21,609 --> 01:03:23,998
"And we know nothing, nothing but us

638
01:03:24,209 --> 01:03:26,882
"Far away the wedding music sounds
and memory becomes a bride

639
01:03:27,049 --> 01:03:29,882
"And on your chest I rest my head
I rest my head

640
01:03:30,129 --> 01:03:34,964
"The world of dreams is right here

641
01:03:35,409 --> 01:03:39,322
"I saw it with your eyes

642
01:03:41,089 --> 01:03:42,727
"The dense smoke

643
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:45,405
"is parting

644
01:03:46,049 --> 01:03:47,482
"The fog is lifting

645
01:03:47,729 --> 01:03:49,640
"Look, now the light of heaven

646
01:03:49,889 --> 01:03:51,845
"falls everywhere"

647
01:03:58,049 --> 01:04:02,201
Time, jihad and death wait for no man.

648
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:05,608
- Day after tomorrow.
- Not day after, but tomorrow.

649
01:04:06,729 --> 01:04:09,038
Tomorrow is IG Khan's birthday.

650
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:12,124
Yes. And this is his present?

651
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,565
Yes. Sadiq, hold this.

652
01:04:17,409 --> 01:04:20,446
Now we have to get this map
to IG Khan...

653
01:04:20,529 --> 01:04:24,158
...so that he assembles all his forces
down here at Chinar Baug...

654
01:04:24,889 --> 01:04:28,086
...and our work up here will be easy.

655
01:04:28,169 --> 01:04:31,957
A good plan, child.
But how will you get there?

656
01:04:34,569 --> 01:04:36,480
I've taken care of that.

657
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:38,768
I even went there today.

658
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:40,804
How?

659
01:04:41,049 --> 01:04:43,802
With the help of a friend.

660
01:04:45,889 --> 01:04:49,564
During jihad, a warrior only has
friendships with men, child.

661
01:04:49,729 --> 01:04:53,483
Women are soft-hearted.
They can't keep secrets.

662
01:04:55,649 --> 01:04:58,447
- That girl...
- She's ignorant of our plans.

663
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:01,200
Five men will accompany me.

664
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:03,564
Apart from Ali and Ghafoor,
you, you and you, Zubair.

665
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:07,561
That girl loves you. You use her like this?

666
01:05:07,769 --> 01:05:12,285
He who walks the path of jihad
leaves all relationships behind.

667
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,242
God is great. He is our ruler.

668
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:22,521
If those infidels find this map
on the body of a dead militant...

669
01:05:22,609 --> 01:05:24,440
...what will they think?

670
01:05:24,649 --> 01:05:26,367
They'll at once believe the map.

671
01:05:26,529 --> 01:05:28,759
Where will we find such a body?

672
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:31,199
We'll manage.

673
01:05:32,049 --> 01:05:35,724
Anyway, with this missing leg
how far can you walk with us?

674
01:05:40,969 --> 01:05:43,085
With warriors like Sadiq...

675
01:05:44,169 --> 01:05:46,683
...we cannot lose this war.

676
01:05:46,929 --> 01:05:50,717
Sadiq said, "If this map is found
on a dead militant's body...

677
01:05:51,529 --> 01:05:53,247
"...the soldiers won't suspect us."

678
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:56,127
He picked up the gun
and sacrificed himself for our jihad.

679
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:58,200
We won't let his offering go to waste.

680
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:02,282
Your friend gave his life for jihad.
You must win this war.

681
01:06:04,529 --> 01:06:07,521
Before his body becomes cold...

682
01:06:07,809 --> 01:06:10,084
...take it, with the map, to Anantnag.

683
01:06:14,009 --> 01:06:15,237
Be careful!

684
01:06:35,689 --> 01:06:38,078
You're late! The concert is about to start.

685
01:06:38,169 --> 01:06:40,080
Sorry, Sufi, I was delayed.

686
01:06:40,409 --> 01:06:43,560
The last time I called you to a program,
you were ten years late.

687
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:46,203
Glad it wasn't 20 this time!
Where were you?

688
01:06:47,089 --> 01:06:50,206
- My friends heard I was coming...
- You should've brought them along.

689
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:52,928
I did. Security won't admit them.

690
01:06:53,049 --> 01:06:56,519
Good! Let them stay out there.
You'll look like a fool.

691
01:06:57,209 --> 01:06:59,723
- But you said...
- Bring your friends?

692
01:06:59,889 --> 01:07:01,641
We've a problem, Altaaf.

693
01:07:01,969 --> 01:07:05,803
New rules. Now you have to pay
fees to admit your friends.

694
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:07,563
- Fees?
- Yes, fees.

695
01:07:08,409 --> 01:07:09,762
How much?

696
01:07:10,729 --> 01:07:12,242
- How many friends?
- Five.

697
01:07:12,889 --> 01:07:14,880
Five? Why not ten?

698
01:07:17,689 --> 01:07:19,725
For five the fees will be...

699
01:07:27,889 --> 01:07:29,561
And you. Six.

700
01:07:31,649 --> 01:07:33,446
This is for being ten years late.

701
01:07:36,209 --> 01:07:41,920
I love you so much, Sufi.
Come what may, I'll always love you.

702
01:07:43,369 --> 01:07:45,007
- Forever.
- Forever?

703
01:07:46,449 --> 01:07:47,882
Come what may?

704
01:07:50,569 --> 01:07:52,878
Sufi, time can change...

705
01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:57,480
Altaaf, we can't talk about time now.
The concert is about to start.

706
01:07:57,729 --> 01:08:00,562
If you'll let go of me,
I'll bring your friends in.

707
01:08:10,009 --> 01:08:11,522
- Hello.
- Hello?

708
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:12,564
TV tower?

709
01:08:13,209 --> 01:08:15,200
I'm at the centre, extension 22.

710
01:08:15,329 --> 01:08:18,446
The live concert is about to air,
but there's a wiring problem.

711
01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:20,167
We've sent engineers.

712
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,843
But time's running out.
Please hurry up the repairs.

713
01:08:23,369 --> 01:08:24,324
Thank you.

714
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:38,888
Give the phone to IG Khan-saab, please.
Tell him it's urgent.

715
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:40,368
He's praying.

716
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:41,764
I'll hold on.

717
01:08:54,209 --> 01:08:55,881
- Open your mouth.
- Why?

718
01:08:56,489 --> 01:08:58,286
- You don't remember?
- Remember what?

719
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:03,161
- Yes, it's your birthday!
- Wonderful, you remember everything.

720
01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:05,087
How could I forget?

721
01:09:05,169 --> 01:09:09,287
How could I think you would?
You! Forget? Lmpossible.

722
01:09:10,129 --> 01:09:13,326
23rd September, my birthday?
How would you forget?

723
01:09:14,289 --> 01:09:15,642
What's the date today?

724
01:09:16,329 --> 01:09:17,557
June 5th.

725
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:20,122
Whose birthday?

726
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:21,483
Whose?

727
01:09:21,649 --> 01:09:22,923
Mine?

728
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:26,162
Congratulations!

729
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:32,280
Your memory is improving day by day.
Should we get help?

730
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:36,241
We could go to Lucknow
to your father's for some... Remember?

731
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,198
Never mind that.

732
01:09:40,329 --> 01:09:43,366
What a beating you got
from my dad because of this ru-ba-ru.

733
01:09:43,449 --> 01:09:46,919
Of course I did.
After all, I'm a simple Kashmiri.

734
01:09:47,889 --> 01:09:50,403
Without thinking,
I jumped out of your window.

735
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:54,565
Got badly hurt, didn't you?

736
01:09:55,849 --> 01:09:59,683
And you gave me the medicine.
See, it still hurts.

737
01:09:59,849 --> 01:10:03,080
Really? Two hard slaps
and it'll clear right up.

738
01:10:03,249 --> 01:10:05,479
- Some Lucknowi treatment?
- Medicine?

739
01:10:10,449 --> 01:10:12,644
Sorry, sir, Altaaf on the line.

740
01:10:16,009 --> 01:10:18,204
Where are you calling from, Altaaf?

741
01:10:18,369 --> 01:10:19,597
IG Khan-saab.

742
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,688
It's your birthday today
and we are celebrating.

743
01:10:22,849 --> 01:10:24,248
Where are you, Altaaf?

744
01:10:24,449 --> 01:10:29,477
Be at Shankracharya at 10:00 sharp.
We've arranged fireworks for you...

745
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:34,438
...the kind you've never seen before.
Good-bye.

746
01:10:41,929 --> 01:10:43,920
Altaaf, quick. The concert is starting.

747
01:10:44,169 --> 01:10:45,488
Where are my friends?

748
01:10:45,649 --> 01:10:47,640
In the canteen, eating samosas.

749
01:10:51,809 --> 01:10:55,484
Who are you? How did you get in?

750
01:10:56,329 --> 01:10:57,762
What are you doing?

751
01:11:16,449 --> 01:11:20,203
Last night the BSF killed a militant.
They found this in his pocket.

752
01:11:42,889 --> 01:11:46,928
"Flowers will sweetly scent the air
once more

753
01:11:48,849 --> 01:11:53,877
"The seasons of fragrance will come
once more

754
01:11:55,849 --> 01:12:00,479
"On the branches of the chinar tree
once more

755
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:06,284
"Birds will build nests

01:12:08,729 --> 01:12:13,280
"And those who have fled from these paths

757

"will return

758
01:12:21,689 --> 01:12:26,080
"And again in these bylanes of heaven

01:12:27,489 --> 01:12:34,122
"Everyone will sing this happy song

760
01:13:06,969 --> 01:13:11,997
"Let the sweet notes of harmony mingle

761
01:13:21,089 --> 01:13:24,286
"I've come to sing a song of love

"To embrace the whole world
with one melody

01:13:28,129 --> 01:13:31,041
"To wipe out hatred in every heart

764
01:13:31,889 --> 01:13:35,404
"Come, friends, sing with me

765
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:49,126
"I've come to sing a song of love

"Come, friends, sing with me"

Move! Move! Move!

781
01:16:45,329 --> 01:16:46,444
Come on, quickly.

782
01:16:54,049 --> 01:16:56,927
"Music is a sweet rain

783
01:16:57,249 --> 01:17:00,559

Khan-saab, come in, Khan-saab.

805
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:13,237
- Altaaf?
- How did you like my painting?

806
01:18:13,809 --> 01:18:16,960
- Altaaf, where are you?
- I'm not like you, Khan-saab.

807
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:20,321
I don't kill children.

808
01:18:20,969 --> 01:18:24,928
- Where are you, Altaaf?
- Look towards Shankracharya.

809
01:18:25,929 --> 01:18:29,365
Your birthday firecrackers
are about to go off.

810
01:18:31,329 --> 01:18:32,762
Happy birthday.

811
01:18:34,809 --> 01:18:35,798
Abba!

812
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:01,998
- Pahalgam calling Gulmarg, over.
- Yes.

813
01:19:02,129 --> 01:19:03,847
- Pahalgam calling Gulmarg, over.
- I'm getting you.

814
01:19:04,249 --> 01:19:06,365
Mission Kashmir's first phase is over.

815
01:19:06,769 --> 01:19:08,725
Carry on, carry on.

816
01:19:09,169 --> 01:19:13,208
Mission Kashmir's first phase is over.
Are you listening?

817
01:19:13,529 --> 01:19:14,848
Yes, I am.

818
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:17,518
The TV tower is blown to bits.

819
01:19:19,169 --> 01:19:22,479
I want to see India shattered into pieces
the same way.

820
01:19:22,569 --> 01:19:23,445
God willing.

821
01:19:23,529 --> 01:19:26,521
Fragments of the tower fell
as far as Nishat Baug and Char Chinar.

822
01:19:26,689 --> 01:19:28,327
If you need anything, tell us.

823
01:19:28,489 --> 01:19:31,481
The mission will end in victory,
God willing.

824
01:19:31,649 --> 01:19:33,162
A thousand thanks to God...

825
01:19:33,249 --> 01:19:35,922
Keep depositing the money in the bank.

826
01:19:36,089 --> 01:19:38,125
Leave the rest to God. Over and out.

827
01:19:38,329 --> 01:19:39,682
Over and out.

828
01:19:41,249 --> 01:19:42,568
Congratulations...

829
01:19:43,889 --> 01:19:46,278
...on Mission Kashmir's first victory.

830
01:19:47,369 --> 01:19:48,768
Nothing can stop us now.

831
01:19:53,049 --> 01:19:56,405
What is your next target
after the TV tower?

832
01:19:58,289 --> 01:20:00,598
Is this why you worked
at the TV Centre?

833
01:20:00,769 --> 01:20:01,679
No, Khan-saab.

834
01:20:01,849 --> 01:20:03,919
You think you'll get away?

835
01:20:06,489 --> 01:20:09,845
We know where you two used to meet.

836
01:20:10,049 --> 01:20:13,837
We also know you went out
in a shikara with him.

837
01:20:14,449 --> 01:20:19,318
And you smuggled him into the TV Centre
knowing he would kill the guards...

838
01:20:19,489 --> 01:20:21,764
...and blow up the tower and escape.

839
01:20:22,649 --> 01:20:26,005
Tell me, who gives you orders?

840
01:20:28,329 --> 01:20:30,604
Nobody. Please believe me.

841
01:20:30,849 --> 01:20:32,601
Who will believe you?

842
01:20:33,369 --> 01:20:36,247
Will the widows of the dead
believe you?

843
01:20:37,209 --> 01:20:39,803
You're one of them, Sufi.

844
01:20:40,929 --> 01:20:43,966
You breached security
and brought him to your office...

845
01:20:44,049 --> 01:20:47,086
...and let him use your intercom.
What is he to you?

846
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:49,642
Nothing.

847
01:20:54,209 --> 01:20:55,608
I love him.

848
01:20:59,089 --> 01:21:02,320
He returned after ten years and...

849
01:21:03,849 --> 01:21:05,202
He had changed.

850
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:08,444
I know.

851
01:21:11,849 --> 01:21:16,525
After his parents were killed,
he came with me to my home.

852
01:21:19,889 --> 01:21:24,087
My wife also loves him
as much as you do.

853
01:21:25,609 --> 01:21:27,440
I have no link with him.

854
01:21:29,809 --> 01:21:32,118
But what can I do?

855
01:21:32,689 --> 01:21:34,008
I love him.

856
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:49,163
Take her home.

857
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:52,526
- Did she reveal anything, sir?
- She doesn't know anything.

858
01:21:52,609 --> 01:21:54,645
- But, sir...
- Leave her alone, Avinash.

859
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:09,608
Is he mute from childhood?

860
01:22:09,689 --> 01:22:12,157
No. Najibullah's men tortured him.
They wanted Hilal.

861
01:22:12,249 --> 01:22:14,604
He stuck out his tongue and...

862
01:22:15,809 --> 01:22:17,686
Our information is correct, child.

863
01:22:17,769 --> 01:22:19,088
Day after tomorrow...

864
01:22:19,169 --> 01:22:21,399
...lndia's Prime Minister
will come to the valley at noon.

865
01:22:21,489 --> 01:22:23,559
I'm ready to welcome him, sir.

866
01:22:23,889 --> 01:22:25,242
Please look carefully.

867
01:22:26,249 --> 01:22:30,037
This is a picture of a deadly terrorist
named Altaaf Khan.

868
01:22:31,129 --> 01:22:34,246
21 years old, fair-complexioned...

869
01:22:35,169 --> 01:22:37,558
...green eyes, 6 feet tall.

870
01:22:38,329 --> 01:22:42,288
If you see him, please
inform the police immediately.

871
01:22:46,689 --> 01:22:48,327
That's not good.

872
01:22:49,409 --> 01:22:52,003
Now all of Srinagar will recognize you.

873
01:22:52,449 --> 01:22:53,723
Leave at once...

874
01:22:54,089 --> 01:22:57,445
...for Krishna Raina's old house
in Kunjar village.

875
01:22:57,849 --> 01:23:01,125
It's far, but secure. Go now.

876
01:23:16,729 --> 01:23:18,606
- Hello, Number-man.
- Thanks.

877
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:24,605
Altaaf-bhai,
kahvah from Ghafoor.

878
01:23:25,689 --> 01:23:27,919
Is there a phone close by?

879
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:31,360
There's one near Rainawari Square.
It's far. Have kahvah first.

880
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:43,244
No, Abba, I'm fine.

881
01:23:44,289 --> 01:23:45,722
I'm not upset.

882
01:23:47,169 --> 01:23:49,967
Abba, please understand. Don't come now.

883
01:23:51,329 --> 01:23:53,001
Then throw away those tickets!

884
01:23:53,489 --> 01:23:55,639
What does it cost anyway,
Jammu to Srinagar?

885
01:23:56,529 --> 01:23:59,919
Why don't you understand?
Altaaf has gone back.

886
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:03,205
Please give the phone to Ammi.

887
01:24:06,209 --> 01:24:07,483
Ammi.

888
01:24:09,409 --> 01:24:12,924
You were right. My Altaaf is dead.

889
01:24:28,009 --> 01:24:30,125
- Hello, Ammi, l...
- Sufi, this is Altaaf.

890
01:24:31,089 --> 01:24:33,649
- Altaaf?
- I want to see you.

891
01:24:34,929 --> 01:24:36,647
Don't call me again, ever.

892
01:24:42,409 --> 01:24:45,401
Why did you hang up on me, Sufi?

893
01:24:46,609 --> 01:24:48,327
Answer me.

894
01:24:48,769 --> 01:24:50,168
I don't ever want to talk to you.

895
01:24:50,769 --> 01:24:53,966
And so you put a picture of me on TV
to get me killed.

896
01:24:54,129 --> 01:24:56,324
What about the people you've killed?

897
01:24:56,489 --> 01:25:00,038
Sufi, why don't you understand?
I'm doing all this for my religion.

898
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:07,486
I'm a Muslim, too. Islam doesn't
permit the murder of innocent people.

899
01:25:20,129 --> 01:25:25,726
You're taking revenge for the death
of your parents. That's all.

900
01:25:30,009 --> 01:25:31,601
Stop, Sufi.

901
01:25:33,209 --> 01:25:34,801
Sufi, I said stop.

902
01:26:15,929 --> 01:26:17,408
Madam, for you.

903
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:29,399
You used to love this dish.

904
01:29:30,569 --> 01:29:32,241
I still do.

905
01:29:32,849 --> 01:29:37,445
You should have come home once
to eat food from my hands, just once.

906
01:29:38,569 --> 01:29:39,968
How could I, Ammi?

907
01:29:41,129 --> 01:29:44,087
I'd think of it. Then that face...

908
01:29:45,329 --> 01:29:46,682
Your Abba's face?

909
01:29:46,929 --> 01:29:48,123
No.

910
01:29:49,169 --> 01:29:51,808
The face of that murderer
hiding behind that mask.

911
01:29:52,849 --> 01:29:55,966
The face of that butcher rising
from behind a rain of bullets.

912
01:29:56,529 --> 01:30:00,807
- And smoke and showers of hot blood...
- You mustn't talk like that, Son.

913
01:30:02,369 --> 01:30:05,725
I'm here now! Don't be afraid.

914
01:30:10,129 --> 01:30:11,960
I'm not afraid, Ammi.

915
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:17,764
For ten years
that face hasn't let me sleep.

916
01:30:18,649 --> 01:30:23,120
Whenever I try to sleep,
those eyes start staring at me.

917
01:30:24,009 --> 01:30:27,479
All the burning villages
that I've seen in these ten years...

918
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:29,800
...start to blaze in my head.

919
01:30:30,649 --> 01:30:34,119
All the screams I've heard
begin to shriek in my ears.

920
01:30:35,369 --> 01:30:39,840
All the corpses I've seen
appear behind that face and taunt me.

921
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:46,845
I will have no peace
until I wipe out that face...

922
01:30:48,289 --> 01:30:50,519
...nor will I have sleep.

923
01:30:52,569 --> 01:30:55,083
What shall I do, Ammi?
What shall I do?

924
01:30:57,089 --> 01:31:01,082
Whoever fires that fatal bullet,
it's my heart that it will pierce.

925
01:31:02,849 --> 01:31:05,647
But this war is not
between you and Khan-saab.

926
01:31:06,929 --> 01:31:09,489
On one side is love,
on the other, hatred.

927
01:31:10,489 --> 01:31:12,719
On one side is compassion,
on the other, terror.

928
01:31:13,489 --> 01:31:14,888
You have to choose.

929
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:17,883
Good or evil, brutality or humanity...

930
01:31:18,089 --> 01:31:20,603
...Kashmir or holocaust,
what will stay alive...

931
01:31:20,769 --> 01:31:22,248
...you have to decide, Altaaf.

932
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:23,884
Only you.

933
01:31:26,249 --> 01:31:30,083
So think hard
before you fire that bullet, Son.

934
01:31:32,049 --> 01:31:33,528
Think very hard.

935
01:31:38,449 --> 01:31:41,009
Tomorrow, I will survey
the whole area by helicopter.

936
01:31:41,809 --> 01:31:44,528
This area near Pari Mahal,
where the PM's helicopter will land...

937
01:31:44,849 --> 01:31:46,601
...is a sensitive one.

938
01:31:46,809 --> 01:31:50,165
I've arranged for a thousand children
to welcome the PM...

939
01:31:50,289 --> 01:31:51,608
Excuse me.

940
01:31:52,809 --> 01:31:54,083
Hello?

941
01:32:04,729 --> 01:32:05,923
Okay.

942
01:32:10,369 --> 01:32:11,802
Sir, for his welcome...

943
01:32:12,049 --> 01:32:15,325
Mr. Khan, you discuss the PM's security.

944
01:32:16,129 --> 01:32:19,758
While your wife has dodged
her own security and disappeared.

945
01:32:20,929 --> 01:32:22,965
Can you tell me where she's gone?

946
01:32:24,929 --> 01:32:26,282
I'll ask Neelima, sir.

947
01:32:26,449 --> 01:32:28,758
What you do is a personal matter.

948
01:32:29,329 --> 01:32:31,240
Our intelligence bureau tells us...

949
01:32:31,849 --> 01:32:36,843
...that you deliberately let go
of the terrorist who attacked you...

950
01:32:36,929 --> 01:32:39,079
...because of your old association with him.

951
01:32:40,729 --> 01:32:42,162
Look, Inayat Khan-saab...

952
01:32:43,089 --> 01:32:45,125
...we've lost one Prime Minister...

953
01:32:45,929 --> 01:32:49,205
...in the name of religion,
murdered by her own security people.

954
01:32:50,929 --> 01:32:54,399
Under the circumstances,
I don't consider it appropriate...

955
01:32:54,489 --> 01:32:57,526
...to entrust the Prime Minister's
security to you.

956
01:32:59,289 --> 01:33:00,722
Mr. Deshpande...

957
01:33:01,569 --> 01:33:05,039
...it is not the misfortune of Muslims only
but of the entire country...

958
01:33:05,489 --> 01:33:10,199
...that a soldier who has braved bullets for
21 years must keep proving his loyalty...

959
01:33:10,609 --> 01:33:14,318
...because his name is not Deshpande,
but Inayat Khan.

960
01:33:15,929 --> 01:33:18,284
- Look, Mr. Khan...
- You look, Mr. Deshpande.

961
01:33:19,609 --> 01:33:24,125
My blood is in this Kashmiri soil.
My nine-year-old son is buried in it.

962
01:33:25,369 --> 01:33:30,124
My love for this country needs
no certificates from a bureaucrat.

963
01:33:30,649 --> 01:33:33,846
- Listen, Mr. Khan...
- You listen to me, Mr. Deshpande!

964
01:33:34,449 --> 01:33:36,519
I am the state's IG.

965
01:33:36,729 --> 01:33:39,721
The PM's security is my responsibility
and will remain so...

966
01:33:39,809 --> 01:33:41,447
...till you dismiss me.

967
01:33:54,849 --> 01:33:56,282
Where did you go?

968
01:33:56,929 --> 01:34:00,968
- You've returned early today?
- Answer me. Where were you?

969
01:34:02,489 --> 01:34:03,763
I was out.

970
01:34:03,849 --> 01:34:08,001
Wearing a burkha?
Answer me. Where were you?

971
01:34:08,369 --> 01:34:09,768
If you know, why ask?

972
01:34:10,809 --> 01:34:13,277
Why did you go to meet him? Answer me.

973
01:34:14,209 --> 01:34:17,997
To plead with him?
To beg him not to kill your husband?

974
01:34:18,449 --> 01:34:22,647
You think I'm scared of him?
That I tremble at his name?

975
01:34:23,369 --> 01:34:26,600
Nilu, I'm getting angry.
Answer me. Why did you go?

976
01:34:27,689 --> 01:34:31,602
- You've never questioned me like this.
- I am now! Why did you go?

977
01:34:32,809 --> 01:34:36,848
Do you know what he has endured
these past ten years?

978
01:34:37,009 --> 01:34:39,682
The horrors he's seen?
How many deaths he's witnessed?

979
01:34:39,849 --> 01:34:43,842
Not as many as the corpses
I've carried on my shoulders.

980
01:34:44,649 --> 01:34:46,162
Answer me! Why did you go?

981
01:34:46,249 --> 01:34:49,321
- He can't sleep.
- So let him shoot himself.

982
01:34:50,209 --> 01:34:52,598
I didn't tell him to pick up a gun.

983
01:34:54,569 --> 01:34:57,288
I didn't want to bring him home. You did.

984
01:34:58,329 --> 01:35:00,968
"One day he'll understand.
We'll tell him the truth."

985
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:06,125
He understands now. You told him
the truth! Answer me, why did you go?

986
01:35:07,129 --> 01:35:10,565
I went to see him
because I am his mother.

987
01:35:15,089 --> 01:35:17,967
And what am I to you? Answer me.

988
01:35:18,809 --> 01:35:21,482
You are my husband.

989
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:26,083
Husband. Do you know
what a husband's honour is?

990
01:35:26,329 --> 01:35:29,287
Do you know what happened
to my honour because of your action?

991
01:35:29,449 --> 01:35:31,201
What I had to listen to?

992
01:35:31,449 --> 01:35:34,566
- There's blood on your hand.
- To hell with my hand, Nilu.

993
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:39,408
Blood will be spilt now,
mine or Altaaf's.

994
01:35:40,369 --> 01:35:42,564
Whose blood do you want it to be?

995
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:45,163
Your husband's or your son's?

996
01:36:44,449 --> 01:36:47,646
Tomorrow I leave Kashmir for good.

997
01:36:51,249 --> 01:36:55,527
But before I go,
I want to ask you something.

998
01:36:56,849 --> 01:36:59,807
By what right?
As the friend who betrayed me?

999
01:37:00,969 --> 01:37:03,358
Or as the terrorist
who killed innocent people?

1000
01:37:03,449 --> 01:37:06,759
As that 11-year-old Altaaf
whose 6-year-old sister Najjo...

1001
01:37:07,089 --> 01:37:10,798
...and mother and father were murdered
in front of a 9-year-old Sufi?

1002
01:37:11,089 --> 01:37:12,761
Don't talk about that other Altaaf.

1003
01:37:13,649 --> 01:37:17,483
I cradled him in my memories
with such tender love...

1004
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:19,841
...but you killed him.

1005
01:37:20,809 --> 01:37:22,640
You are the murderer of that Altaaf.

1006
01:37:22,729 --> 01:37:24,720
It's true that I lied to you, Sufi.

1007
01:37:25,929 --> 01:37:29,524
But it's also true that I have loved you.

1008
01:37:31,169 --> 01:37:35,128
My only regret is that I hate Khan...

1009
01:37:37,129 --> 01:37:38,448
...as much as I love you.

1010
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:42,884
It is my sorrow, Altaaf...

1011
01:37:44,369 --> 01:37:47,645
...that your hatred is much stronger
than your love.

1012
01:37:47,889 --> 01:37:49,800
I truly love you, Sufi.

1013
01:37:51,409 --> 01:37:54,685
I know your answer but will still ask:

1014
01:37:58,409 --> 01:37:59,922
When this storm ends...

1015
01:38:01,249 --> 01:38:03,160
...will you go with me again
in a shikara?

1016
01:38:32,409 --> 01:38:34,400
I'll never be able to see you.

1017
01:38:36,849 --> 01:38:38,919
But I will dream, Sufi...

1018
01:38:40,529 --> 01:38:42,406
...of those moments...

1019
01:38:43,249 --> 01:38:45,319
...we spent together.

1020
01:38:47,569 --> 01:38:49,082
And also of those moments...

1021
01:38:50,849 --> 01:38:53,317
...which we could not spend together.

1022
01:38:56,769 --> 01:38:58,407
Share that dream if you can.

1023
01:39:09,409 --> 01:39:13,322
"Look, look

1024
01:39:14,729 --> 01:39:18,483
"What shall I look at?

1025
01:39:20,929 --> 01:39:25,047
"Dream, dream

1026
01:39:26,609 --> 01:39:30,921
"What shall I dream?

1027
01:40:20,929 --> 01:40:23,841
"Dream a city of lakes

1028
01:40:25,689 --> 01:40:28,726
"And our house upon the waves

1029
01:40:30,009 --> 01:40:33,365
"Dream a city of lakes

1030
01:40:34,809 --> 01:40:37,926
"And our house upon the waves

"Dream that all the sweet dreams

1032
01:40:43,649 --> 01:40:45,605
"That we weave will come true

1033
01:40:46,129 --> 01:40:48,324
"Just this, nothing more

1034
01:40:48,689 --> 01:40:51,647

Yes, sir. Go ahead, sir.

1064
01:44:56,729 --> 01:45:00,324
- There's a clear gap on the left.
- Avinash, look to the left and back.

1065
01:45:00,809 --> 01:45:02,481
Move up, to the left.

1066
01:45:03,489 --> 01:45:04,365
- Avinash.
- Sir.

1067
01:45:04,569 --> 01:45:06,446
Move them back, cover the right flank.

1068
01:45:06,609 --> 01:45:08,884
To the right, boys. Right flank!

1069
01:45:09,249 --> 01:45:12,525
Move those riflemen to the left.
More to the left.

1070
01:45:12,809 --> 01:45:15,403
Move, move, left, left!
Cover that flank.

1071
01:45:18,209 --> 01:45:21,326
I want two LMGs on that parapet.
No gaps in the fields of fire.

1072
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:25,767
I can see a gap. Up there.
Yes, up, and also to the right.

1073
01:45:27,089 --> 01:45:29,364
- I'm going back to the base. Okay?
- Okay, sir.

1074
01:45:45,889 --> 01:45:47,800
Khan-saab, come in, Khan-saab.

1075
01:45:56,609 --> 01:45:57,928
Go ahead, Altaaf.

1076
01:45:58,529 --> 01:46:01,407
Remember this day ten years ago?

1077
01:46:02,569 --> 01:46:05,720
June 23rd, at Dalgate.

1078
01:46:06,289 --> 01:46:10,646
When, by murdering my whole family,
you gave birth to a new Altaaf.

1079
01:46:11,849 --> 01:46:14,409
Today is the tenth birthday
of that new Altaaf.

1080
01:46:15,769 --> 01:46:18,681
Do you know what my birthday gift is?

1081
01:46:23,169 --> 01:46:23,885
You!

1082
01:46:32,089 --> 01:46:36,640
Hide anywhere, Khan-saab,
but today you won't escape me.

1083
01:46:45,329 --> 01:46:47,797
Altaaf, stop this craziness. Come home...

1084
01:46:48,529 --> 01:46:51,566
...before a bullet from the police...
- Good-bye.

1085
01:47:33,689 --> 01:47:37,125
We heard him on the wireless, Sir-ji.
Please take this threat seriously.

1086
01:47:37,249 --> 01:47:38,887
Keep extra security for yourself.

1087
01:47:38,969 --> 01:47:42,757
Gurdeep, I'm going home for lunch.
Your extra security wouldn't let me...

1088
01:47:42,929 --> 01:47:45,489
Sir-ji, in 15 years,
you've never eaten lunch at home.

1089
01:47:45,649 --> 01:47:48,641
In 15 years I've never
broken even a glass at home.

1090
01:47:48,809 --> 01:47:51,448
Never broken a glass?
What does that mean, Sir-ji?

1091
01:47:52,729 --> 01:47:54,287
May I go home, "Sir-ji?"

1092
01:47:54,449 --> 01:47:56,246
- Okay, Sir-ji.
- Thank you, "Sir-ji."

1093
01:48:19,609 --> 01:48:21,008
Guard! At Ease!

1094
01:48:22,889 --> 01:48:24,447
Sir, SP-saab phoned.

1095
01:48:26,569 --> 01:48:28,400
Sir, Madam hasn't eaten anything.

1096
01:48:28,489 --> 01:48:31,367
Sir, please try and coax her or she'll fall ill.

1097
01:48:31,649 --> 01:48:33,401
She's not had a sip of water today.

1098
01:49:19,169 --> 01:49:21,364

"Come, forgive me now

01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:10,724
Sir-ji.

1132
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:18,761
We caught the man who placed
the bomb in the briefcase.

1133
01:54:19,009 --> 01:54:21,887
He's not alone, sir.
There are two others.

1134
01:54:55,969 --> 01:54:57,448
Where is Altaaf?

1135
01:55:08,209 --> 01:55:10,040
Sir, I'll tell you everything.

1136
01:55:10,209 --> 01:55:14,566
Maharaj Krishna Raina's house
in Kunjar village.

1137
01:55:31,009 --> 01:55:33,569
Where is Altaaf? Where is Altaaf?

1138
01:56:07,089 --> 01:56:09,284
Avinash, what are you doing?
They're all dead.

1139
01:56:11,009 --> 01:56:13,842
He was running off with this camera
and these cassettes.

1140
01:56:13,929 --> 01:56:15,487
They're up to something, sir.

1141
01:56:17,249 --> 01:56:18,284
"Mission Kashmir"?

1142
01:56:24,129 --> 01:56:26,006
Tell me, what is Mission Kashmir?

1143
01:57:01,369 --> 01:57:05,203
Stop! Go back. Right there!

1144
01:57:07,649 --> 01:57:08,764
This man...

1145
01:57:08,849 --> 01:57:10,965
I killed this terrorist in Kunjar village.

1146
01:57:11,449 --> 01:57:13,280
How did he reach Hazratbal mosque?

1147
01:57:13,369 --> 01:57:16,566
- And in a police uniform?
- Khan-saab, Hazratbal is so crowded.

1148
01:57:16,729 --> 01:57:20,483
- They took these shots on a Friday.
- My God, today is Friday.

1149
01:57:20,729 --> 01:57:21,923
How long will it take?

1150
01:57:22,009 --> 01:57:24,569
There are a lot of tapes to transfer.
It'll take time.

1151
01:57:24,649 --> 01:57:28,358
I don't have time. Figure out what
these images mean. Then contact me.

1152
01:57:28,449 --> 01:57:30,087
We don't have time.

1153
01:57:31,249 --> 01:57:32,921
Why do you act like this?

1154
01:57:33,289 --> 01:57:36,167
Had I been hit above
the bullet-proof jacket, I'd be dead.

1155
01:57:36,289 --> 01:57:38,883
The bullet hit you today.
I've known you for years.

1156
01:57:38,969 --> 01:57:40,800
You go mad when you see militants.

1157
01:57:40,889 --> 01:57:43,403
- You wouldn't understand.
- Why? Because I'm a Sikh?

1158
01:57:43,489 --> 01:57:46,401
No. Because you're not a Kashmiri.
You're an outsider.

1159
01:57:46,809 --> 01:57:50,324
You never saw how, instead of prayers,
loud-speakers rained abuses on us.

1160
01:57:51,049 --> 01:57:54,007
They said, "Hindus, leave Kashmir
if you want to stay alive."

1161
01:57:54,089 --> 01:57:56,444
While all the Kashmiri Hindus fled...

1162
01:57:57,049 --> 01:57:59,483
...l, a policeman, watched helplessly.

1163
01:57:59,929 --> 01:58:02,887
- I can understand, Avinash.
- You understand nothing.

1164
01:58:03,169 --> 01:58:05,888
How can you know what it is
to live in a refugee camp?

1165
01:58:06,009 --> 01:58:09,524
What it is to watch your home
burn down before your very eyes?

1166
01:58:12,969 --> 01:58:15,961
How can you know what it is
to be separated from your family?

1167
01:58:17,729 --> 01:58:22,723
No, I will never understand
because I have no family left at all.

1168
01:58:23,769 --> 01:58:27,159
They were all killed in 1984
in one single day, in Delhi.

1169
01:58:28,209 --> 01:58:31,087
They put a tire around my father's neck
and burnt him alive.

1170
01:58:31,169 --> 01:58:32,397
Know who did it?

1171
01:58:32,609 --> 01:58:34,406
A crazy Hindu. Asshole.

1172
01:58:35,449 --> 01:58:38,919
Who shall I blame? Shall I kill you, Hindu?

1173
01:58:39,569 --> 01:58:42,686
Sir, IG-saab has sent for you. It's urgent.

1174
01:58:44,609 --> 01:58:48,841
No, I can't kill you.
Not because you're my friend.

1175
01:58:49,449 --> 01:58:52,566
But because we're not killers.
We're here to protect.

1176
01:58:52,849 --> 01:58:56,319
We must safeguard humanity.
We must save Kashmir.

1177
01:59:00,889 --> 01:59:04,199
We won't let the martyrdom
of 20 boys go to waste.

1178
01:59:05,009 --> 01:59:07,569
These innocent children have been killed...

1179
01:59:07,889 --> 01:59:10,642
...by those responsible
for your mother's death, child.

1180
01:59:12,009 --> 01:59:14,762
Allah has chosen you for this work.

1181
01:59:15,889 --> 01:59:19,279
Allah has chosen you
for this mission, my child.

1182
01:59:20,409 --> 01:59:25,039
India's PM should not leave
this valley alive.

1183
01:59:25,849 --> 01:59:27,999
This is our Mission Kashmir.

1184
01:59:28,809 --> 01:59:32,119
Do you know why Allah
called your mother to Him?

1185
01:59:33,129 --> 01:59:36,917
So that, when you kill IG Khan along
with the PM, your hands won't tremble.

1186
01:59:37,649 --> 01:59:39,480
Understand, child?

1187
01:59:43,929 --> 01:59:44,998
Good boy!

1188
01:59:46,689 --> 01:59:47,519
Now rise.

1189
01:59:48,569 --> 01:59:53,279
Tell me, how and where you will blow up
the PM's helicopter?

1190
01:59:58,009 --> 02:00:00,682
Somebody open the door!

1191
02:00:10,809 --> 02:00:12,242
Help! Open the door!

1192
02:00:13,169 --> 02:00:14,124
Hurry up!

1193
02:00:27,729 --> 02:00:30,368
Douse the flames.
Sir-ji, he's out. Okay, Sir-ji.

1194
02:00:31,929 --> 02:00:33,681
Okay. Follow him, Gurdeep.

1195
02:00:51,049 --> 02:00:52,368
Avinash, do you see him?

1196
02:00:52,689 --> 02:00:54,998
Yes, sir. He's heading
towards Kukar Bazaar.

1197
02:01:05,169 --> 02:01:07,000
I've got him, Avinash.
He's going through Pakki Lane.

1198
02:01:09,649 --> 02:01:12,766
Exactly at 2:45,
the PM's helicopter will land here.

1199
02:01:13,129 --> 02:01:16,519
As the rotors stop, the chief minister
will step forward to garland him.

1200
02:01:16,889 --> 02:01:19,323
- And then, the first blast.
- Idris will fire.

1201
02:01:20,129 --> 02:01:22,927
At this blast, IG Khan
will move from the police cordon...

1202
02:01:23,009 --> 02:01:25,125
...with his men, to enter the helipad.

1203
02:01:26,329 --> 02:01:28,047
Then, the second missile.

1204
02:01:28,529 --> 02:01:31,362
- Specially for IG Khan.
- You'll fire it, Altaaf.

1205
02:01:32,009 --> 02:01:35,160
Your quest and my mission,
both victorious, God willing.

1206
02:01:35,969 --> 02:01:38,608
How long have you waited
for this moment, child?

1207
02:01:41,969 --> 02:01:43,163
A thousand years!

1208
02:02:00,929 --> 02:02:04,285
He's crossing Amirkadal bridge.
You cover him now, Avinash.

1209
02:02:14,689 --> 02:02:17,442
Security is very tight
because of the PM's arrival.

1210
02:02:17,569 --> 02:02:19,446
We cannot all move together.

1211
02:02:19,649 --> 02:02:22,959
We'll go in three units
to Rainawari via different routes.

1212
02:02:23,489 --> 02:02:25,957
- The first unit from here.
- Idris.

1213
02:02:27,569 --> 02:02:29,560
The second, with me, from here.

1214
02:02:30,129 --> 02:02:32,165
The third, from here...

1215
02:02:32,769 --> 02:02:33,679
...with me.

1216
02:02:40,209 --> 02:02:42,325
Sir, he's crossing Chinar Baug.

1217
02:02:44,169 --> 02:02:47,479
He's crossed the wooden bridge,
heading towards Dalgate, Sir-ji.

1218
02:02:53,969 --> 02:02:55,118
Child...

1219
02:02:56,529 --> 02:03:00,841
...don't forget your innocent sister,
your mother and father.

1220
02:03:00,929 --> 02:03:04,080
IG Khan butchered them all
in front of your eyes.

1221
02:03:05,169 --> 02:03:08,559
Don't forget, Allah sends
such an opportunity just once.

1222
02:03:09,329 --> 02:03:14,039
Allah is your protector.
Your target is IG Khan.

1223
02:03:15,409 --> 02:03:18,242
Go, my child, and destroy that infidel.

1224
02:03:27,929 --> 02:03:32,002
Before the launch, when the missiles
turn towards the real target...

1225
02:03:32,089 --> 02:03:34,523
...this child may panic.

1226
02:03:35,169 --> 02:03:36,284
Calm him down.

1227
02:03:37,489 --> 02:03:39,002
If he doesn't consent...

1228
02:03:40,529 --> 02:03:44,044
...shoot him through the head.
Don't cause him pain. He's my child.

1229
02:03:50,689 --> 02:03:53,328
Sir, he's taking the lane
towards Khyam Chowk.

1230
02:04:02,369 --> 02:04:05,998
He's crossing the Jhelum.
We'll take him at the other end, Sir-ji.

1231
02:04:09,769 --> 02:04:11,885
Pahalgam calling Gulmarg, over.

1232
02:04:12,889 --> 02:04:14,880
Gulmarg's getting you loud and clear, over.

1233
02:04:27,329 --> 02:04:29,399
- Gurdeep, cover the house.
- Okay, Sir-ji.

1234
02:04:29,649 --> 02:04:32,038
- Avinash, you cover me.
- Yes, sir.

1235
02:04:32,169 --> 02:04:34,763
- I'm entering the house. Okay?
- We've surrounded it, sir.

1236
02:04:35,089 --> 02:04:36,886
Move it, move it! Stop the car.

1237
02:04:37,489 --> 02:04:41,323
We're leaving this place.
The mission proceeds as planned.

1238
02:04:41,929 --> 02:04:44,318
- Are you ready?
- Ready for the telecast, over.

1239
02:04:48,049 --> 02:04:49,118
Over and out.

1240
02:04:52,609 --> 02:04:54,201
Don't fire, don't shoot him!

1241
02:04:55,249 --> 02:04:57,126
Greetings, Khan-saab.

1242
02:04:58,289 --> 02:04:59,927
What is Mission Kashmir?

1243
02:05:00,609 --> 02:05:01,928
Where is Altaaf?

1244
02:05:03,529 --> 02:05:05,565
- Mazar-e-Sharif.
- What?

1245
02:05:06,129 --> 02:05:09,087
1987. The Russians cut my neck.

1246
02:05:10,729 --> 02:05:14,324
For seven days, I held my head
to my slashed neck.

1247
02:05:15,689 --> 02:05:20,922
No food, water, sleep, nothing
or my head would have fallen off.

1248
02:05:22,009 --> 02:05:25,797
For seven days I held up my severed head.
I didn't tell them anything.

1249
02:05:26,249 --> 02:05:28,809
And you, what can you do to me
in 37 minutes?

1250
02:05:28,969 --> 02:05:30,846
Want to try? Go ahead.

1251
02:05:31,769 --> 02:05:33,282
37 minutes?

1252
02:05:33,769 --> 02:05:38,160
36 minutes now. My child Altaaf
must have begun the mission already.

1253
02:05:38,889 --> 02:05:42,768
- In 36 minutes, your India...
- 36 minutes? 10 seconds!

1254
02:05:43,769 --> 02:05:47,728
In 10 seconds, I'll blow your brains out
if you don't talk. Talk!

1255
02:05:48,969 --> 02:05:50,880
Ten, nine...

1256
02:05:51,569 --> 02:05:53,321
...eight, seven...

1257
02:05:53,769 --> 02:05:55,122
...six, five...

1258
02:05:56,489 --> 02:05:59,287
...four, three, two...
- Sir.

1259
02:05:59,449 --> 02:06:00,928
- One
- Sufi.

1260
02:06:12,209 --> 02:06:14,006
Khan-saab, this is Mission Kashmir.

1261
02:06:14,609 --> 02:06:17,567
I've joined all the pieces
of this picture together.

1262
02:06:19,169 --> 02:06:20,921
And it's terrifying.

1263
02:06:30,009 --> 02:06:33,558
Sir, our army commandos are ready.
As soon as you order, they'll attack.

1264
02:06:33,649 --> 02:06:36,561
Where will you attack?
Do you know where the missiles are?

1265
02:06:36,729 --> 02:06:39,323
In 36 minutes
you'll search all of Kashmir?

1266
02:06:40,369 --> 02:06:43,679
No commandos, no army, no police
can do anything now.

1267
02:06:44,969 --> 02:06:46,766
We've lost Kashmir.

1268
02:06:48,409 --> 02:06:51,879
- But I'll blow Hilal's face to bits.
- Stop, Khan-saab.

1269
02:06:53,849 --> 02:06:55,328
Only he knows...

1270
02:06:55,689 --> 02:06:59,045
...where the missiles are.
- But why would he take us there?

1271
02:07:04,569 --> 02:07:06,082
He'll take us.

1272
02:07:07,289 --> 02:07:08,517
I'm sure he will...

1273
02:07:10,289 --> 02:07:13,565
...if he believes that my love
for Kashmir is less...

1274
02:07:15,049 --> 02:07:17,085
...than my hatred for Altaaf.

1275
02:07:18,449 --> 02:07:22,124
If he believes that I'm so blinded
by my thirst for revenge...

1276
02:07:23,049 --> 02:07:24,960
...that I've forgotten India.

1277
02:07:26,049 --> 02:07:29,644
If he believes that he will be saved...

1278
02:07:30,729 --> 02:07:32,162
...and I will die.

1279
02:07:33,689 --> 02:07:35,759
But I'll have to go alone with him.

1280
02:07:36,009 --> 02:07:38,603
- We will give you cover, sir.
- No wrong move!

1281
02:07:39,449 --> 02:07:42,680
One wrong move
and Kashmir will be destroyed.

1282
02:07:43,649 --> 02:07:46,527
No one will follow me.
Is that understood?

1283
02:07:47,449 --> 02:07:49,917
But, Khan-saab, you alone?

1284
02:07:52,369 --> 02:07:55,441
Either I will die or Kashmir will be saved.

1285
02:07:58,289 --> 02:08:02,043
Sufi, go with Avinash and Gurdeep.
Take Nilu's ashes...

1286
02:08:03,089 --> 02:08:05,762
...and immerse them
in the Ganges at Haridwar.

1287
02:08:06,489 --> 02:08:08,684
Perhaps she'll forgive me.

1288
02:08:21,329 --> 02:08:23,126
Everyone out. Out!

1289
02:08:49,249 --> 02:08:50,887
I've lost, Hilal.

1290
02:08:51,769 --> 02:08:54,124
My men were following Altaaf.

1291
02:08:55,209 --> 02:08:58,440
I've just been told that they've lost him.

1292
02:08:59,929 --> 02:09:01,965
Now only you can take me to him.

1293
02:09:03,249 --> 02:09:07,800
Here. If you want, finish me off.
But give me Altaaf.

1294
02:09:08,849 --> 02:09:12,524
Give you my child Altaaf? No, Khan.

1295
02:09:13,769 --> 02:09:16,522
He is no longer your son. He is my child.

1296
02:09:16,849 --> 02:09:21,206
- Through him, we will destroy India.
- Let India rot and Kashmir go to hell.

1297
02:09:22,289 --> 02:09:23,847
I only want Altaaf.

1298
02:09:25,609 --> 02:09:27,327
You love him dearly.

1299
02:09:28,409 --> 02:09:30,764
But our entire mission depends on him.

1300
02:09:31,289 --> 02:09:33,928
You can have your mission, Hilal.

1301
02:09:34,809 --> 02:09:36,162
But give me Altaaf.

1302
02:09:37,329 --> 02:09:40,207
With my own hands
I'll give him such a death...

1303
02:09:40,369 --> 02:09:43,281
...that no son will ever again
dare kill his mother.

1304
02:09:45,009 --> 02:09:48,797
You are a Pathan, Hilal.
You know what revenge means.

1305
02:09:51,209 --> 02:09:53,928
I beg you to let me
avenge my wife's murder.

1306
02:09:55,569 --> 02:09:58,766
If you are a true Pathan,
then understand my hatred.

1307
02:09:59,369 --> 02:10:01,678
A Pathan knows only two things...

1308
02:10:02,329 --> 02:10:05,958
...boundless love and limitless hatred.

1309
02:10:06,489 --> 02:10:08,480
Then fulfil your duty, Pathan.

1310
02:10:09,409 --> 02:10:10,398
Give me Altaaf.

1311
02:10:11,409 --> 02:10:16,688
You will get Altaaf. They will
get Kashmir. What will I get?

1312
02:10:18,729 --> 02:10:19,718
Your life.

1313
02:10:22,049 --> 02:10:24,961
My men will escort you
past the Line of Control.

1314
02:10:26,169 --> 02:10:27,727
Nobody will touch you.

1315
02:10:30,529 --> 02:10:34,078
Your hatred is truly worthy
of a Pathan's praise.

1316
02:10:35,889 --> 02:10:36,958
I accept.

1317
02:11:38,809 --> 02:11:41,687
Khan, you've reached your destination.

1318
02:11:57,449 --> 02:11:59,246
- Idris!
- Sir.

1319
02:12:08,489 --> 02:12:10,844
You're late, sir. Is all well?

1320
02:12:11,649 --> 02:12:14,368
I had stopped to get you a gift.

1321
02:12:14,769 --> 02:12:17,727
This pistol belongs
to the same infidel police officer...

1322
02:12:18,569 --> 02:12:20,764
...who orphaned you as a child.

1323
02:12:25,209 --> 02:12:26,119
Khan?

1324
02:12:26,849 --> 02:12:28,328
Yes, Khan!

1325
02:12:37,009 --> 02:12:40,797
I told you, execute my mission
and I'll take you to your goal.

1326
02:12:41,489 --> 02:12:45,038
A Pathan honours his word
even when given to an enemy.

1327
02:12:45,689 --> 02:12:47,759
And you, you are my child.

1328
02:12:48,969 --> 02:12:52,518
Here, take it.
Go and complete your mission.

1329
02:14:42,689 --> 02:14:45,806
These are the eyes that
haven't let me sleep for ten years.

1330
02:15:39,729 --> 02:15:41,924
Kill me, but listen to me, Altaaf.

1331
02:15:42,049 --> 02:15:44,165
I'll give you such a death...

1332
02:15:46,649 --> 02:15:48,685
Like the death you gave Neelima?

1333
02:16:10,489 --> 02:16:14,641
Look. This is all that's left
of the woman who loved you as her son.

1334
02:16:15,249 --> 02:16:18,605
The same will happen to Kashmir.
And you will be responsible.

1335
02:16:22,289 --> 02:16:24,359
You want to know
what Mission Kashmir is?

1336
02:16:24,449 --> 02:16:26,883
It has nothing to do
with the PM's visit.

1337
02:16:29,369 --> 02:16:33,157
Today is Friday. Thousands of people
will gather at Hazratbal for prayers.

1338
02:16:33,249 --> 02:16:35,444
As they kneel, your missile will hit.

1339
02:16:37,489 --> 02:16:41,038
The innocent blood of Muslims
will turn that white mosque red.

1340
02:16:41,249 --> 02:16:42,523
And you will be responsible.

1341
02:16:52,009 --> 02:16:53,840
The missile is ready, sir.

1342
02:16:59,009 --> 02:17:02,046
The Indian army will be blamed
for blowing up Hazratbal mosque.

1343
02:17:02,209 --> 02:17:04,677
They'll say that the Hindu
security forces blew it up.

1344
02:17:04,769 --> 02:17:08,603
Think, Altaaf! Your men were filmed
wearing Indian army uniforms.

1345
02:17:11,089 --> 02:17:13,922
- This isn't true.
- That's not all, Altaaf.

1346
02:17:14,769 --> 02:17:18,000
Remember, Nilu took you
to Shankracharya temple as a child?

1347
02:17:18,569 --> 02:17:23,165
Today, your second missile will land
on the kneeling pilgrims at Shankracharya.

1348
02:17:27,689 --> 02:17:29,805
The child is taking too long.

1349
02:17:30,849 --> 02:17:32,328
Come, Kohisha.

1350
02:17:33,969 --> 02:17:37,484
They'll say that Muslims destroyed
the temple in revenge for the mosque.

1351
02:17:37,569 --> 02:17:39,207
This is your Mission Kashmir.

1352
02:17:44,409 --> 02:17:47,321
They destroyed our TV tower
to spread this lie...

1353
02:17:47,409 --> 02:17:50,560
...so that on their TV they could
broadcast those faked images.

1354
02:17:50,769 --> 02:17:53,488
Your Sufi saw this apocalypse
with her own eyes, Altaaf.

1355
02:17:57,769 --> 02:18:01,284
Think of the riots
when Babri mosque was destroyed.

1356
02:18:02,089 --> 02:18:04,649
Of the carnage,
they fired at the Golden Temple.

1357
02:18:04,729 --> 02:18:07,482
Think, if Shankracharya
and Hazratbal are both...

1358
02:18:12,329 --> 02:18:15,526
Our world will be doomed.
A bloody plague will claim us.

1359
02:18:16,209 --> 02:18:18,769
Human beings will become
maddened brutes, Altaaf.

1360
02:18:18,889 --> 02:18:22,086
My one mistake destroyed
your entire life, Son.

1361
02:18:26,689 --> 02:18:29,920
But this mistake of yours
will destroy all of Kashmir, Son.

1362
02:18:30,089 --> 02:18:32,239
You've never been able to forgive me.

1363
02:18:32,329 --> 02:18:34,559
Kashmir too will never forgive you, Son.

1364
02:18:34,649 --> 02:18:37,004
Because Mission Kashmir
is the death of Kashmir.

1365
02:18:39,929 --> 02:18:43,717
This infidel talks too much.
Finish him off, child.

1366
02:19:00,729 --> 02:19:03,721
Kill me, Altaaf, but save Kashmir, Son.

1367
02:19:03,929 --> 02:19:05,248
Kill him, child.

1368
02:19:08,209 --> 02:19:12,839
These eyes haven't let you sleep.
Put your bullet between them.

1369
02:19:12,929 --> 02:19:14,521
Kill him, child, kill him.

1370
02:19:15,049 --> 02:19:18,086
But for your mother's sake,
save Kashmiriyat, Son.

1371
02:19:18,289 --> 02:19:21,326
- Kill him, child.
- She used to take you to Hazratbal.

1372
02:19:21,409 --> 02:19:23,240
Altaaf, don't think. Kill him.

1373
02:19:23,329 --> 02:19:25,559
You've forgotten Shankracharya?

1374
02:19:26,169 --> 02:19:28,399
- Shoot me!
- Kill him, child.

1375
02:19:38,209 --> 02:19:41,565
Good or evil, brutality or humanity...

1376
02:19:42,289 --> 02:19:45,042
...Kashmir or holocaust,
what will stay alive...

1377
02:19:45,609 --> 02:19:47,520
...you have to decide, Altaaf.

1378
02:19:48,169 --> 02:19:49,443
Only you.

1379
02:19:51,329 --> 02:19:53,843
So think hard
before you fire that bullet, Son.

1380
02:19:55,449 --> 02:19:56,882
Think very hard.

1381
02:20:11,569 --> 02:20:14,925
Don't kill him, Altaaf.
He'll take us to the missiles.

1382
02:20:56,689 --> 02:20:59,886
Stop. Nobody shoots. Lower your guns.

1383
02:21:00,089 --> 02:21:03,399
Stop or I'll spill Hilal's brains
into the lake.

1384
02:21:07,809 --> 02:21:08,639
Child.

1385
02:21:10,329 --> 02:21:13,799
"Smoke everywhere

1386
02:21:15,169 --> 02:21:18,684
"Just Smoke"

1387
02:21:21,369 --> 02:21:23,485
God is testing you.

1388
02:21:23,609 --> 02:21:26,407
He's watching
if you're straying from His path.

1389
02:21:26,489 --> 02:21:29,925
Pick up your gun
and finish off this enemy of Allah.

1390
02:21:30,049 --> 02:21:33,928
"Who wrote strife into our lives

1391
02:21:34,809 --> 02:21:38,643
"Using the name of God?"

1392
02:21:39,649 --> 02:21:41,719
My child, remember?

1393
02:21:42,809 --> 02:21:46,768
I took care of you.
I put a carbine into your hands.

1394
02:21:47,729 --> 02:21:49,685
I showed you the path of jihad.

1395
02:21:49,769 --> 02:21:54,047
"This oppression, these crimes

1396
02:21:54,729 --> 02:21:58,404
"Who calls it jihad?"

1397
02:21:58,529 --> 02:22:01,362
I'm thankful that today
you are carrying me yourself...

1398
02:22:01,449 --> 02:22:05,044
...on the path to paradise,
on the path to the merciful.

1399
02:22:05,689 --> 02:22:08,965
Do you understand, child?

1400
02:22:09,889 --> 02:22:18,479
"When will these storms cease?

1401
02:22:19,449 --> 02:22:24,045
"Thousands of tender buds

1402
02:22:24,489 --> 02:22:29,165
"Have been torn unblossomed
from their branches"

1403
02:22:29,809 --> 02:22:34,963
To kill infidels is your goal,
your duty, your only destiny.

1404
02:22:35,769 --> 02:22:38,237
It is Allah's will that you kill the enemy.

1405
02:22:38,969 --> 02:22:45,727
"Who is laying waste our paradise?"

1406
02:22:47,729 --> 02:22:51,881
This is your faith, child.
This is your only religion.

1407
02:22:55,769 --> 02:22:57,088
Out! Out!

1408
02:23:05,049 --> 02:23:09,361
For spreading death instead of life
in the name of religion...

1409
02:23:12,649 --> 02:23:16,767
...for placing carbines instead of crayons
in the hands of innocent children...

1410
02:23:20,489 --> 02:23:24,528
...for turning Kashmir
from a paradise into hell...

1411
02:23:27,889 --> 02:23:29,686
...I sentence you to death.

1412
02:24:03,689 --> 02:24:05,680
Blow up Shankracharya! Quickly!

1413
02:24:06,209 --> 02:24:07,483
Blow it up!

1414
02:24:26,809 --> 02:24:27,924
Hurry up.

1415
02:26:05,249 --> 02:26:07,717
An operation,
code named Mission Kashmir...

1416
02:26:07,809 --> 02:26:11,484
...to destroy the holy shrines,
Hazratbal and Shankracharya...

1417
02:26:12,529 --> 02:26:17,478
...was foiled by timely and intrepid
action by the Kashmir Police.

1418
02:26:19,369 --> 02:26:20,802
Sir.

1419
02:26:22,849 --> 02:26:23,804
What happened?

1420
02:26:23,889 --> 02:26:27,199
Our failure of Mission Kashmir
must be kept a secret.

1421
02:26:27,369 --> 02:26:30,805
We're lucky that nobody knows
of this mission except us.

1422
02:26:31,089 --> 02:26:33,444
Yes. Except you.

1423
02:26:46,169 --> 02:26:49,400
Come on, Altaaf. Come on, Khan-saab.

1424
02:26:50,929 --> 02:26:52,885
Out! Altaaf's out!

1425
02:26:53,169 --> 02:26:56,047
I'm not out. You're cheating.

1426
02:26:56,249 --> 02:26:57,967
Altaaf, give me the bat.

1427
02:26:58,889 --> 02:27:00,766
Let it be, Khan-saab.

1428
02:27:01,089 --> 02:27:03,967
- Nilu, you too!
- Altaaf is home, after so long.

1429
02:27:07,289 --> 02:27:09,007
- I wasn't out, was I?
- No.

1430
02:27:15,849 --> 02:27:17,919
Altaaf, what happened?

1431
02:27:25,129 --> 02:27:26,642
A snow-covered field...

1432
02:27:28,369 --> 02:27:30,280
...a green cricket pitch...

1433
02:27:31,929 --> 02:27:33,044
...a wooden bridge...

1434
02:27:34,249 --> 02:27:35,648
And a pink house.

1435
02:27:40,769 --> 02:27:42,760
Today, after ten years...

1436
02:27:44,769 --> 02:27:47,203
...I saw a dream, Abba.
- What did you say?

1437
02:27:48,689 --> 02:27:50,759
- After ten years...
- No. After that.

1438
02:27:53,729 --> 02:27:56,118
- I saw a dream.
- After that, Altaaf.

1439
02:27:59,409 --> 02:28:00,524
Abba.

1440
02:28:08,689 --> 02:28:10,088
Abba.
