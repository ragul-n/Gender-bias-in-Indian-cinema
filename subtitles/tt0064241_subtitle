complained about you?

- Will I have to tell that, too?
- How will I know then?

473

- That we've made up.
- That's it?

- And that our friendship will 
last long. - Only friendship?

479

It's possible this friendship
turns to some other relation.

dreaming all this.

Two eyes of someone,
and the love in them for me.

Someone's eyes? 
Are these eyes mine?

to see anything except me?

"Our eyes met each other's.
O dear, what has happened?"

"A heart called another
heart and they had a meeting."

made an excuse."

"Dear, you said
you can't come today."

"But you came over.
O dear, what has happened?"

"But you came over.
O dear, what has happened?"

and am with you."

has insulted whom.

00:59:27,271 --> 00:59:30,244
Brother... You listen to everything
that she says to make her happy.

847
00:59:30,723 --> 00:59:32,948
But the result of pampering
her so much won't be good.

848
00:59:33,188 --> 00:59:36,895
I don't want to learn from you
what I should do and not do.

849
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,410
Brother... 
looking at her selfishness...

850
00:59:39,435 --> 00:59:42,020
...and small heart, I think 
that she cannot stay in this house.

851
00:59:42,106 --> 00:59:43,106
Uncouth.

852
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:49,086
Satyen... 
why don't you apologize?

853
00:59:50,529 --> 00:59:52,281
You are telling this, 
sister-in-law?

854
00:59:53,063 --> 00:59:54,647
You know that 
I am not at fault.

855
00:59:56,897 --> 01:00:01,252
Whether guilty or not, 
you are younger.

856
01:00:01,888 --> 01:00:04,878
And it is never bad for the
young to apologize to elders.

857
01:00:06,626 --> 01:00:09,312
Go. Go and apologize to Neela.

858
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,670
I apologize, sister-in-law.

859
01:00:26,357 --> 01:00:27,357
Navendu...

860
01:00:28,387 --> 01:00:29,844
I am sorry, mother.

861
01:00:30,295 --> 01:00:32,343
For the first time,
I raised my hand on Satyen.

862
01:00:33,295 --> 01:00:35,395
I don't know what has happened...

863
01:00:36,243 --> 01:00:38,450
...to this house ever since
Neela has come in this house.

864
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:40,004
Whatever be the case, mother.

865
01:00:40,936 --> 01:00:42,296
She is the daughter-in-law
of the house now, isn't it?

866
01:00:42,502 --> 01:00:46,143
But this doesn't mean all her
mistakes should be covered.

867
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:48,412
I tell you.

868
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,784
If this spark isn't 
trampled right now...

869
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,844
...it will become a fire and
set fire to the whole house.

870
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:56,926
- What?
- Can't we live separate?

871
01:00:57,568 --> 01:00:58,590
What do you mean?

872
01:00:59,297 --> 01:01:00,309
I mean...

873
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:04,236
Nowadays... everyone lives 
alone after marriage.

874
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,711
You take a small flat too.

875
01:01:08,087 --> 01:01:10,025
There isn't anyone 
other than us here.

876
01:01:10,763 --> 01:01:12,916
Even now, there isn't anyone 
other than us here.

877
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,385
No, Viju, one's own house 
is one's own house.

878
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:24,433
Look here. There is 
no curtain or any privacy.

879
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,660
Even at this time, elders of young.
Anyone can come to our room.

880
01:01:28,215 --> 01:01:30,324
I am scared 
of changing clothes too.

881
01:01:30,629 --> 01:01:33,011
Oh! Why don't you lock 
the door from inside?

882
01:01:33,376 --> 01:01:37,215
Oh no! What will they think?
It doesn't seem right.

883
01:01:37,295 --> 01:01:39,243
Forget these worthless things.

884
01:01:40,008 --> 01:01:42,902
Tonight is not 
for such things.

885
01:01:43,365 --> 01:01:46,166
No Viju, you always 
skirt this issue.

886
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,363
- Which issue?
- About the new apartment.

887
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:52,104
Okay. We will do 
as you wish, okay?

888
01:01:54,493 --> 01:01:56,122
- NAVENDU: Who is it?
- Me...

889
01:01:57,638 --> 01:02:00,232
- Can I come inside?
- Who is it?

890
01:02:00,454 --> 01:02:04,152
Oh! So you don't 
recognize me now...

891
01:02:04,177 --> 01:02:06,273
Oh... come, please come, 
please have a seat.

892
01:02:06,421 --> 01:02:08,957
What will I do 
if I don't sit?

893
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:13,161
I thought that it is many days,
I'd remind you.

894
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:14,877
Seth... I remember everything.

895
01:02:14,963 --> 01:02:17,423
So what if you remember?

896
01:02:17,907 --> 01:02:19,624
Even Viju is married off now.

897
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:23,787
And if God agrees... there will 
be a son in a few days too.

898
01:02:24,171 --> 01:02:26,282
Oh Seth... 
I will sweeten your mouth.

899
01:02:26,364 --> 01:02:29,074
Well, you have 
filled my mouth...

900
01:02:29,426 --> 01:02:30,738
...now, when will 
you fill my wallet?

901
01:02:30,933 --> 01:02:35,031
See. I don't go to 
the court in small matters.

902
01:02:35,111 --> 01:02:37,810
What are you 
talking about courts?

903
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,411
It is so sad that 
you say like this.

904
01:02:39,491 --> 01:02:41,002
Tell me. 
Till when should I wait?

905
01:02:41,082 --> 01:02:44,212
What till when?
Wait for two minutes, I will come.

906
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:45,630
Okay.

907
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:48,887
Viju...

908
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:54,203
Elder brother... come brother.

909
01:02:54,851 --> 01:02:57,927
It is the third today, Viju.
You didn't get the salary?

910
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,649
He did get the salary. 
But I thought...

911
01:03:04,376 --> 01:03:07,465
...it is better 
if I keep his salary.

912
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:10,583
Yes.

913
01:03:12,595 --> 01:03:15,148
Yes. It is good. 
It is very good.

914
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:18,122
A wife has a right 
on a husband's earning.

915
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:21,662
Like that, our staying 
and food expenses...

916
01:03:21,687 --> 01:03:23,842
...work out to be 
three hundred rupees.

917
01:03:24,815 --> 01:03:28,845
If you do need money 
other than that, just ask me.

918
01:03:33,463 --> 01:03:34,587
Yes. Why not?

919
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:37,556
I will have to tell you.

920
01:03:59,170 --> 01:03:59,762
Seth...

921
01:04:02,659 --> 01:04:03,734
I am sorry.

922
01:04:04,098 --> 01:04:06,086
I will not be able to
serve you this month.

923
01:04:06,126 --> 01:04:06,542
What?

924
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:09,070
But your money will 
be arranged next month.

925
01:04:09,384 --> 01:04:10,156
I promise you.

926
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:13,560
See, I don't need your promise.
I need my money.

927
01:04:13,646 --> 01:04:15,983
If I don't get my
installment the next month...

928
01:04:16,008 --> 01:04:17,731
...then think about it. Yes.

929
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:29,073
Wait... wait...

930
01:04:30,609 --> 01:04:33,011
- Is this Neela's house?
- No.

931
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:34,531
Whose house is this?

932
01:04:35,172 --> 01:04:38,711
The name of the owner of this
house is Navendu Prasad Gupta.

933
01:04:38,869 --> 01:04:41,291
See, do you know 
where Neela lives?

934
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:43,640
She lives here.

935
01:04:44,223 --> 01:04:45,790
- Then who are you?
- I am a man.

936
01:04:46,232 --> 01:04:48,770
Even we can see that you are a man.
But what are you doing here?

937
01:04:49,013 --> 01:04:50,315
I am standing here 
and talking to you.

938
01:04:50,441 --> 01:04:51,656
But who are you?

939
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:53,908
Think that I am a servant.

940
01:04:54,087 --> 01:04:56,954
Then go and tell Neela
that his guests have arrived.

941
01:04:58,564 --> 01:05:01,387
Come... please come...

942
01:05:01,942 --> 01:05:03,622
- Hi...
- Hello, hi, Neeta...

943
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:06,544
...Hi Sushma... hi, Kanta...
oh, have a seat.

944
01:05:06,716 --> 01:05:09,746
Should I bring some tea or
something for your guests?

945
01:05:09,862 --> 01:05:12,286
Of course, and please 
be quick about it.

946
01:05:13,462 --> 01:05:14,901
Hey, eat it.

947
01:05:14,926 --> 01:05:16,191
I couldn't see the movie.

948
01:05:16,278 --> 01:05:17,860
There were so many 
guests in my house.

949
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,468
I was all ready. 
I was so angry.

950
01:05:21,912 --> 01:05:24,136
Here... 
Have you made all these things?

951
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:28,237
- Why? Didn't you like them?
- No, they are very good.

952
01:05:28,434 --> 01:05:29,520
So, why don't you 
take some more?

953
01:05:29,545 --> 01:05:30,780
Since when are you cooking?

954
01:05:38,207 --> 01:05:40,183
Since some fifteen 
to twenty years.

955
01:05:42,037 --> 01:05:43,485
If the tea is ready, 
just get it.

956
01:05:43,831 --> 01:05:46,345
- Where did you work before this?
- Yes?

957
01:05:46,797 --> 01:05:48,245
Where were you 
servant before this?

958
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:52,431
Me?

959
01:05:54,232 --> 01:05:56,792
I am working in this
house since the beginning.

960
01:05:56,921 --> 01:05:58,120
Geeta has come.

961
01:06:02,019 --> 01:06:05,199
- Now can I ask you something?
- You?

962
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:07,799
- Where did you work before this?
- What?

963
01:06:08,054 --> 01:06:10,126
Why are you staring at me?

964
01:06:10,614 --> 01:06:12,528
- What do you mean?
- I mean what I say.

965
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:12,965
Satyen!

966
01:06:13,341 --> 01:06:16,011
You have nice friends.
They don't even know how to talk.

967
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:17,850
NEELA'S FRIEND: Who are
you to teach us how to speak?

968
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:19,419
Madam...

969
01:06:19,624 --> 01:06:22,044
If you become a wax doll,
nothing is achieved in life.

970
01:06:22,285 --> 01:06:25,953
It is necessary to learn how
to speak other's houses too.

971
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:28,393
- Oh! You shut up!
- You shut up!

972
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:29,786
- God...
- Out!

973
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,410
Satyen... don't forget 
that they are my friends.

974
01:06:32,927 --> 01:06:34,652
Therefore I am 
using just my tongue.

975
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:36,012
And listen...

976
01:06:36,101 --> 01:06:37,470
Your friends too 
don't have any right...

977
01:06:37,495 --> 01:06:38,780
...to think that my
sister-in-law is a cook...

978
01:06:38,805 --> 01:06:41,496
...and that my sister is a servant.
Tell them to go away from here.

979
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:43,752
Wow, Neela. You abused 
us well calling us here.

980
01:06:43,777 --> 01:06:45,590
- You were so hospitable...
- Oh my god.

981
01:06:45,763 --> 01:06:48,420
If there was something less
in hospitality should I fulfill it?

982
01:06:48,597 --> 01:06:50,836
Satyen... if they go, 
even I will go.

983
01:06:51,052 --> 01:06:52,679
By chance... the door is open.

984
01:06:52,825 --> 01:06:55,439
- Come on, Sushma.
- Come on.

985
01:06:55,851 --> 01:06:56,851
NEELA'S FRIEND: Such insult.

986
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:02,481
Wait. If I don't teach 
them a lesson...

987
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:05,161
...then do change 
my name as well.

988
01:07:05,457 --> 01:07:09,933
There is a new problem.

989
01:07:10,545 --> 01:07:11,741
NEELA'S MOTHER: 
Did you say anything to me?

990
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:15,654
I am not mad like you.

991
01:07:16,153 --> 01:07:21,502
I challenge just 
one enemy at one time.

992
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,948
What? I am your enemy?

993
01:07:25,051 --> 01:07:31,034
I was speaking about 
these chess pieces.

994
01:07:31,059 --> 01:07:35,009
Who is it, Viju? 
See, I am Neela's mother.

995
01:07:35,034 --> 01:07:39,130
You come quickly. 
Yes, right now.

996
01:07:41,513 --> 01:07:44,640
Neela. You won't get 
such a chance again.

997
01:07:45,121 --> 01:07:47,039
Take advantage of 
Satyen's mistake.

998
01:07:47,365 --> 01:07:49,738
And come out of 
this problem of a family.

999
01:07:52,246 --> 01:07:55,861
It seems that Rahu 
and Ketu have...

1000
01:07:55,886 --> 01:07:59,934
...sat in poor Navendu's
horoscope this year.

1001
01:08:01,112 --> 01:08:02,295
Rina's mother...

1002
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,516
It is not good to meddle
in Neela's house matters.

1003
01:08:06,786 --> 01:08:09,357
You shut your mouth.
How many times have I told you...

1004
01:08:09,412 --> 01:08:11,161
...not interfere 
in the family affairs.

1005
01:08:11,515 --> 01:08:15,039
Where am I talking 
about my house?

1006
01:08:15,544 --> 01:08:18,899
I am talking about 
Navendu's house.

1007
01:08:19,116 --> 01:08:21,128
You just look at 
your chess pieces.

1008
01:08:21,645 --> 01:08:23,910
Neela, I will show 
you such a way out...

1009
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,985
...that even you 
will remember it.

1010
01:08:27,012 --> 01:08:28,211
Now let it be, sister.

1011
01:08:28,489 --> 01:08:29,989
Why do you think so
much about small matters?

1012
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,200
Wow...

1013
01:08:31,289 --> 01:08:33,465
On whose money 
the whole family runs...

1014
01:08:33,545 --> 01:08:36,387
...she was chucked
out of the house along...

1015
01:08:36,419 --> 01:08:38,777
...with all her guests, and you 
say that it is a small matter.

1016
01:08:38,802 --> 01:08:40,233
Even sister must 
be guilty in this.

1017
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:41,904
She is after 
them since so long.

1018
01:08:42,065 --> 01:08:43,465
You don't advocate their cause.

1019
01:08:43,878 --> 01:08:47,567
Neela. I will tell you a solution
to cure them. Come with me?

1020
01:08:50,185 --> 01:08:55,234
Tell me too.
How should I make you all right?

1021
01:08:57,678 --> 01:09:00,668
Daughter-in-law... 
what is Navendu doing?

1022
01:09:01,648 --> 01:09:04,071
He is sitting with 
the accounts, what else?

1023
01:09:05,857 --> 01:09:08,214
Viju... you people 
are returning now?

1024
01:09:08,268 --> 01:09:10,122
We were waiting for 
you since so long...

1025
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:11,596
...that you come 
and we eat dinner.

1026
01:09:11,738 --> 01:09:12,590
Come sit.

1027
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:16,967
Come on, sit down. 
We will have food.

1028
01:09:17,298 --> 01:09:18,381
What about food?

1029
01:09:18,509 --> 01:09:20,563
Even having water in
this house is a sin for me.

1030
01:09:23,591 --> 01:09:25,770
No, daughter-in-law,
one doesn't speak like this.

1031
01:09:26,991 --> 01:09:29,311
I know that you felt bad
about what Satyen said.

1032
01:09:30,086 --> 01:09:31,943
I apologize to you for that.

1033
01:09:32,313 --> 01:09:35,577
Neela... you are responsible 
for whatever happened.

1034
01:09:36,241 --> 01:09:39,743
You didn't introduce Madhavi
and Geeta to your friends.

1035
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,547
Let it be, mother. What is 
the need of increasing the matter?

1036
01:09:44,373 --> 01:09:47,108
When I don't have any complaints,
why do you worry?

1037
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,062
Neela... 
please spit out this anger.

1038
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:53,493
Such small matters do
take place in the house.

1039
01:09:55,255 --> 01:09:57,716
Don't give me this sympathy.
You set the fire yourself.

1040
01:09:57,796 --> 01:09:59,060
And you yourself 
sprinkle water?

1041
01:09:59,085 --> 01:10:01,637
Neela... think about 
what you are saying.

1042
01:10:02,066 --> 01:10:03,751
Madhavi is the elder
daughter-in-law of this house.

1043
01:10:04,107 --> 01:10:05,902
And as if I am 
nothing in this house.

1044
01:10:05,927 --> 01:10:06,927
No, Neela.

1045
01:10:07,139 --> 01:10:08,442
Even you are a
daughter-in-law of this house.

1046
01:10:08,467 --> 01:10:11,478
No! Only the woman 
who dances on...

1047
01:10:12,091 --> 01:10:13,452
...the signals 
of the mother-in-law...

1048
01:10:13,477 --> 01:10:15,140
...can be a daughter-in-law 
in this house.

1049
01:10:15,754 --> 01:10:18,676
I am educated.
I am the daughter of a rich father.

1050
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:20,503
I have a respect 
in the society.

1051
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:23,151
Therefore everyone on
the house is jealous of me.

1052
01:10:23,184 --> 01:10:24,234
And everyone hates me.

1053
01:10:24,536 --> 01:10:27,784
Neela, they don't hate you,
they hate your poisoned words.

1054
01:10:28,456 --> 01:10:29,431
Think about it.

1055
01:10:29,557 --> 01:10:31,563
Did you ever have 
Geeta sit with you?

1056
01:10:31,912 --> 01:10:33,562
Did you speak 
nicely to Satyen?

1057
01:10:34,306 --> 01:10:36,477
Did you ever embrace 
the children?

1058
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,750
You say that nobody thought
you a daughter-in-law in this house.

1059
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:41,442
I ask you...

1060
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:45,156
Did you ever give
respect to Madhavi or me...

1061
01:10:45,254 --> 01:10:47,367
...as a daughter-in-law 
which you had to?

1062
01:10:47,446 --> 01:10:50,259
The ones who respect 
others get respect.

1063
01:10:50,682 --> 01:10:52,872
Not for them who think
that the other are wretches.

1064
01:10:53,505 --> 01:10:55,848
I tell you, be silent, 
please be silent.

1065
01:10:55,889 --> 01:10:56,961
Why should I be silent?

1066
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:03,010
I am not that woman who
tolerates all injustice silently.

1067
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,437
I'm the daughter-in-law of
this house and not the maid.

1068
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:09,724
I have as much right on
this house as Madhavi has.

1069
01:11:12,454 --> 01:11:15,189
If you had talents 
like Madhavi...

1070
01:11:16,092 --> 01:11:17,777
...why would we have 
to see this day?

1071
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,328
What kind of talents
does this talented one has?

1072
01:11:20,618 --> 01:11:21,913
Let me hear it too.

1073
01:11:24,476 --> 01:11:26,415
She just accepts 
whatever you say.

1074
01:11:26,714 --> 01:11:29,823
She serves you all through
the day and presses your legs.

1075
01:11:29,848 --> 01:11:31,559
- That's it, isn't it?
- Don't talk, Neela.

1076
01:11:32,006 --> 01:11:33,351
If you don't care 
about youngsters...

1077
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:34,613
...at least give some
respect to the elders.

1078
01:11:34,663 --> 01:11:36,882
When the elders don't
have pity for the elders...

1079
01:11:37,598 --> 01:11:39,725
...and they don't have love,
then how can the youngsters...

1080
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,270
...have respect 
and dignity for the elders?

1081
01:11:41,387 --> 01:11:42,067
Neela...

1082
01:11:42,373 --> 01:11:44,837
The people say that
mother-in-law is like a mother.

1083
01:11:45,456 --> 01:11:48,859
But I say... Every mother-in-law
is a enemy of the daughter-in-law.

1084
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:50,652
She is always after her.

1085
01:11:50,878 --> 01:11:52,611
Neela, stop this nonsense.

1086
01:11:54,684 --> 01:11:56,615
Your words are out 
of tolerance now.

1087
01:11:57,452 --> 01:11:59,118
You have insulted 
everyone in this house.

1088
01:11:59,196 --> 01:12:01,893
You insulted me,
my wife and kids and my siblings.

1089
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:04,996
But I kept silent. But today...

1090
01:12:07,495 --> 01:12:09,409
You have insulted mother.

1091
01:12:09,954 --> 01:12:12,334
And I will not tolerate it
under any circumstances.

1092
01:12:14,174 --> 01:12:17,986
Come forward,
touch mother's legs and apologize.

1093
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:20,211
I didn't say anything for
which I should apologize.

1094
01:12:20,455 --> 01:12:22,529
You have said 
a very big thing.

1095
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:25,811
Such a big thing has never
been said in this house.

1096
01:12:26,037 --> 01:12:28,341
- Seek an apology.
- No. Never.

1097
01:12:29,093 --> 01:12:33,299
Neela... only they are humans
who understand their mistake.

1098
01:12:33,948 --> 01:12:36,431
And the mistake that you
did has just one repentance.

1099
01:12:36,559 --> 01:12:38,956
Fall at her feet and ask
forgiveness from her or else...

1100
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:39,354
Or else?

1101
01:12:39,394 --> 01:12:41,176
Or else you don't have
any place in this house.

1102
01:12:41,201 --> 01:12:41,553
[SMIRKS]

1103
01:12:41,934 --> 01:12:44,731
- Neela... - Let it be, 
the matter will increase.

1104
01:12:44,814 --> 01:12:46,350
You don't speak in between.

1105
01:12:47,046 --> 01:12:51,374
Viju... you tell Neela.
Tell her to apologize to mother.

1106
01:12:52,323 --> 01:12:54,268
I think that it is 
not necessary, brother.

1107
01:12:54,731 --> 01:12:55,226
What?

1108
01:12:56,934 --> 01:12:58,937
Whatever Neela 
has said is the truth.

1109
01:12:59,676 --> 01:13:01,207
And telling 
the truth is no crime.

1110
01:13:01,603 --> 01:13:03,147
You are advocating 
Neela's cause?

1111
01:13:04,044 --> 01:13:05,067
I am her husband.

1112
01:13:06,024 --> 01:13:08,035
All the house hold members
can walk away from here.

1113
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:09,551
But I cannot.

1114
01:13:09,771 --> 01:13:11,071
- You can do this?
- Satyen.

1115
01:13:12,924 --> 01:13:17,436
Okay, Viju. 
Listen to my decision too.

1116
01:13:19,065 --> 01:13:20,928
Either you both 
apologize to mother.

1117
01:13:21,882 --> 01:13:23,631
Or else go away 
from this house forever.

1118
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,532
- You are saying this?
- Yes, I am saying this.

1119
01:13:27,591 --> 01:13:29,192
The one who insults 
mother cannot...

1120
01:13:29,327 --> 01:13:31,005
...stay in this house 
for even a moment.

1121
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:32,588
So what if he 
is my own brother?

1122
01:13:35,336 --> 01:13:37,183
- Think about it.
- I have thought about it!

1123
01:13:38,783 --> 01:13:41,331
If you think that Neela
is greater than mother...

1124
01:13:41,925 --> 01:13:43,952
...then even you 
can go with her, go away!

1125
01:13:49,911 --> 01:13:55,356
PLAYING SONG ON PHONOGRAPH:
"Ek Bangla Bane Nyara".

1126
01:14:11,431 --> 01:14:14,241
Here... please have some curd.

1127
01:14:17,008 --> 01:14:17,668
It is said...

1128
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,668
The one who eats curd and goes...

1129
01:14:21,409 --> 01:14:23,298
...returns some 
day or the other.

1130
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:26,215
For my sake?

1131
01:14:30,029 --> 01:14:31,029
Farewell.

1132
01:14:38,116 --> 01:14:39,324
Forgive me, mother.

1133
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,959
I didn't fulfill the
promise I gave to father.

1134
01:14:43,706 --> 01:14:46,852
No, son. What did you not do?

1135
01:14:50,103 --> 01:14:52,423
The way you have 
supported them...

1136
01:14:53,204 --> 01:14:56,338
...people don't even support 
their children like that.

1137
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:06,621
Did you call me?

1138
01:15:07,905 --> 01:15:09,871
- Yes, please have a seat, 
Mr. Gupta. - Thank you.

1139
01:15:12,772 --> 01:15:13,922
Here you are.

1140
01:15:16,263 --> 01:15:19,393
- What is this?
- Notice. And a month's salary.

1141
01:15:23,342 --> 01:15:23,949
Notice?

1142
01:15:24,172 --> 01:15:26,551
And you will get 
your provident fund later.

1143
01:15:27,696 --> 01:15:30,134
But what are you saying, sir.

1144
01:15:30,883 --> 01:15:33,012
I have worked for this
company for twenty two years.

1145
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,395
I am sorry, Mr. Gupta.

1146
01:15:35,118 --> 01:15:36,515
The company is in doldrums.

1147
01:15:37,262 --> 01:15:38,918
Other people are 
being answered too.

1148
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:44,318
I can't do anything.
I am sorry. I am very sorry.

1149
01:15:55,024 --> 01:15:57,382
Hey... what happened?

1150
01:15:58,178 --> 01:16:01,599
- Nothing... I just fainted.
- Are you all right?

1151
01:16:02,483 --> 01:16:03,483
I was scared.

1152
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:06,762
What is the matter, son?
You seem very worried?

1153
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:07,939
Nothing mother.

1154
01:16:08,982 --> 01:16:10,672
I have a headache.

1155
01:16:10,822 --> 01:16:13,480
If you work all through the day,
won't you have a headache?

1156
01:16:14,043 --> 01:16:16,455
Please take your coat off.
I will bring some tea.

1157
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,152
Okay.

1158
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:21,301
I have told you so many times.
Take care of your health.

1159
01:16:21,485 --> 01:16:24,307
Oh! Brother Navendu, 
you are at home today?

1160
01:16:24,403 --> 01:16:26,644
Why? Should I be 
outside home all the time?

1161
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:28,909
- You should be there.
- Where?

1162
01:16:29,608 --> 01:16:31,293
- At Viju's house.
- Why?

1163
01:16:31,899 --> 01:16:33,265
Mother, don't you know?

1164
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:36,637
Viju has been promoted,
he has become a big man.

1165
01:16:37,054 --> 01:16:37,580
Really?

1166
01:16:37,613 --> 01:16:40,078
Yes. He has become a
general manager of the company.

1167
01:16:40,103 --> 01:16:42,192
- The general manager...
- But who told me?

1168
01:16:42,241 --> 01:16:45,835
Viju's driver... 
his friend told me.

1169
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:48,165
It is such good news.

1170
01:16:48,565 --> 01:16:51,732
I think as if 
I have been promoted.

1171
01:16:51,951 --> 01:16:53,006
Congratulations.

1172
01:16:53,584 --> 01:16:55,881
He has become such a big
officer at such a young age...

1173
01:16:55,977 --> 01:16:57,810
Nobody. Nobody becomes one.

1174
01:16:57,914 --> 01:17:00,485
He has a big buffet 
in his house today.

1175
01:17:00,557 --> 01:17:03,214
Pulao... Biryani...

1176
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,421
Hey... what are we doing here?

1177
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:06,720
Come on to his house.

1178
01:17:06,745 --> 01:17:08,915
Yes. We should surely

01:26:56,956 --> 01:26:58,487
I don't know what to do.

1346
01:26:59,537 --> 01:27:02,001
Are there so many problems in the
house just because Viju has left it?

1347
01:27:02,532 --> 01:27:03,532
No, Rina.

1348
01:27:04,277 --> 01:27:05,713
Brother has lost his job.

1349
01:27:08,113 --> 01:27:09,873
All problems don't 
come together.

1350
01:27:10,179 --> 01:27:11,606
He will get some other job.

1351
01:27:12,224 --> 01:27:14,230
Brother cannot get
any other job at this age.

1352
01:27:15,008 --> 01:27:16,386
He has weak eyes.

1353
01:27:17,045 --> 01:27:19,379
And then, it is torture to
make him work at this age too.

1354
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,654
I feel like leaving 
this education...

1355
01:27:21,734 --> 01:27:24,254
...and do some labor or
hard work somewhere.

1356
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:27,654
But... But I shouldn't 
let brother work.

1357
01:27:27,807 --> 01:27:30,094
Your education 
will help brother.

1358
01:27:30,475 --> 01:27:31,995
You can help him more
when you are educated.

1359
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:34,030
Where is the time 
for education, Rina?

1360
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:37,779
Once that Viju has gone,
Kali will ask for the loan.

1361
01:27:38,357 --> 01:27:39,418
And on that side...

1362
01:27:40,012 --> 01:27:42,178
Mother won't be able to
tolerate Viju's separation.

1363
01:27:42,898 --> 01:27:44,355
Everything will be all right.

1364
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:49,236
If you get a proper job...
I won't let you leave the job.

1365
01:27:49,516 --> 01:27:53,543
Mother... I had told 
Navendu before hand.

1366
01:27:53,778 --> 01:27:56,496
Brother... if you are taking 
the loan, think about it.

1367
01:27:57,436 --> 01:27:58,245
Yes, brother.

1368
01:27:58,853 --> 01:28:00,999
Who knew that the situation
would change like this?

1369
01:28:08,965 --> 01:28:10,646
Geeta has grown up.

1370
01:28:11,692 --> 01:28:14,000
You were saying something?

1371
01:28:14,735 --> 01:28:15,936
I was saying...

1372
01:28:16,107 --> 01:28:20,267
See, you don't have anything.
But Viju has everything.

1373
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,535
What will happen with that?

1374
01:28:21,705 --> 01:28:23,043
What will not happen?

1375
01:28:23,068 --> 01:28:24,754
You had taken 
a loan on this house.

1376
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:28,394
And this house is the wealth
of all you three brothers.

1377
01:28:29,005 --> 01:28:30,080
Legally...

1378
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:34,124
I can take the loan back from you,
Satyen or Viju too.

1379
01:28:34,172 --> 01:28:35,965
Tell me, or just one.

1380
01:28:36,455 --> 01:28:37,455
Is this possible?

1381
01:28:37,663 --> 01:28:41,437
Why isn't it possible?
It is happening since years.

1382
01:28:41,804 --> 01:28:44,614
Viju has money. 
He can repay the loan.

1383
01:28:45,224 --> 01:28:47,711
And then, you had 
taken the loan for him.

1384
01:28:48,174 --> 01:28:49,594
Kali babu is right.

1385
01:28:50,204 --> 01:28:51,687
Let him take the loan from him.

1386
01:28:51,852 --> 01:28:54,128
No mother. I cannot 
let him do this at all.

1387
01:28:54,506 --> 01:28:55,796
What will you do then?

1388
01:28:56,962 --> 01:28:58,747
I will do whatever I can.

1389
01:29:00,311 --> 01:29:01,816
If needed, I will sell myself.

1390
01:29:02,052 --> 01:29:05,466
See. If you sell yourself,
I won't get my money back.

1391
01:29:05,728 --> 01:29:08,703
Navendu... I have spoken to
you in the tongue of friendship.

1392
01:29:08,815 --> 01:29:10,716
I will have to speak to
you in a legal tongue now.

1393
01:29:10,923 --> 01:29:11,917
Please don't say 
like that, brother.

1394
01:29:11,987 --> 01:29:13,696
Whatever you say, 
this is what will happen.

1395
01:29:13,808 --> 01:29:15,610
I give you time 
for a week more.

1396
01:29:15,846 --> 01:29:18,361
If you don't arrange for
my money in that time...

1397
01:29:18,548 --> 01:29:20,262
...then this house 
will be auctioned.

1398
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:22,251
No... no...

1399
01:29:23,087 --> 01:29:24,087
Navendu...

1400
01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:27,516
Mother... mother...

1401
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:29,873
Madhu... Satyen...

1402
01:29:30,335 --> 01:29:34,085
How did you remember me...

1403
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,707
You aren't worth 
to be missed by anyone.

1404
01:29:37,751 --> 01:29:39,380
Then why have 
come to my house?

1405
01:29:39,491 --> 01:29:41,190
Even my shoe 
wouldn't come here.

1406
01:29:41,602 --> 01:29:43,150
Sister-in-law forced 
me to come here.

1407
01:29:43,284 --> 01:29:44,670
To abuse me?

1408
01:29:45,656 --> 01:29:47,790
Who will spoil 
their mouths by abusing you?

1409
01:29:48,357 --> 01:29:51,396
I have just come here to tell
you that mother is not well.

1410
01:29:52,651 --> 01:29:53,651
I see...

1411
01:29:53,857 --> 01:29:54,550
Okay...

1412
01:29:55,324 --> 01:29:56,620
So you can see too?

1413
01:29:58,095 --> 01:30:01,491
Much better and 
sharper than before.

1414
01:30:01,919 --> 01:30:04,114
If only your heart was
clear like your sight too.

1415
01:30:04,977 --> 01:30:06,711
The ones who have 
a dirty heart...

1416
01:30:06,865 --> 01:30:08,537
...they see everything 
bad about others.

1417
01:30:08,632 --> 01:30:10,117
That is what 
I wanted to tell you too.

1418
01:30:10,234 --> 01:30:13,129
It is good that you said it.
I will leave now.

1419
01:30:13,671 --> 01:30:16,121
- Tell brother.
- Listen...

1420
01:30:17,365 --> 01:30:20,555
Don't you want money 
for mother's cure?

1421
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:22,183
What mother wants...

1422
01:30:22,248 --> 01:30:23,928
Maybe she won't get 
it from this house.

1423
01:30:24,534 --> 01:30:25,975
What is that?

1424
01:30:27,703 --> 01:30:30,597
A son's love and 
a daughter-in-law's duty.

Has your sir come?

1451
01:34:44,419 --> 01:34:48,585
No. He has gone to 
the club with madam.

1452
01:34:48,979 --> 01:34:51,349
He has kept 
this letter for you.

1453
01:34:52,084 --> 01:34:53,370
Letter? 
What is there in this?

What is there?

1455
01:34:58,286 --> 01:35:01,502
He has sent money. 
Maybe for mother's cure.

1456
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:06,653
Take this. 
And give it back to your sir.

1457
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:12,177
Tell him, that mother 
needs a son, not money.

1458
01:35:13,468 --> 01:35:14,258
Greeting sir.

1459
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:18,610

What happened?

1464
01:35:26,962 --> 01:35:29,034
A money order worth five
hundred rupees has arrived.

1465
01:35:30,034 --> 01:35:32,324
From where has it come? 
Who has sent it?

1466
01:35:32,733 --> 01:35:34,914
I don't understand 
who can send this money.

1467
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:36,992
But whatever be 
the case, mother.

1468
01:35:37,233 --> 01:35:40,227
At this time, the one who has
sent this money is an angel.

1469
01:35:42,261 --> 01:35:43,261
An angel.

1470
01:35:47,206 --> 01:35:48,275
I understand.

1471
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:51,344
Please call Khan.

1472
01:35:51,678 --> 01:35:53,787
What is the need 
of calling Khan?

1473
01:35:53,851 --> 01:35:56,034
Mother has called 
and Khan has arrived.

1474
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:57,771
Let me see your hand.

1475
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:02,165
I swear to god,
your face is so bright today.

1476
01:36:03,555 --> 01:36:06,151
If you talk like this, 
will I be cured?

1477
01:36:07,015 --> 01:36:08,670
What did I do now, mother?

1478
01:36:09,998 --> 01:36:12,430
Why did you send this
money order for 500 rupees?

1479
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:14,337
Money order? 
Which money order?

1480
01:36:15,247 --> 01:36:16,575
Why did you send this money?

1481
01:36:16,866 --> 01:36:20,855
Money? What money?
Mother, I didn't send any money.

1482
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:24,865
You call me mother 
and you lie too?

1483
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:29,754
Swear on me. 
You didn't send this money?

1484
01:36:31,047 --> 01:36:33,280
Don't tell me 
to swear on you. Don't.

1485
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:37,334
You sent the money. 
It is your handiwork.

1486
01:36:38,358 --> 01:36:42,750
Mother, I am your neighbor
since ten to twelve years.

1487
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:46,387
I haven't told you 
my story till today.

1488
01:36:47,834 --> 01:36:51,601
I was ten years old, 
my mother expired.

1489
01:36:52,138 --> 01:36:57,516
My father married again.
That mother was very strict.

1490
01:36:58,681 --> 01:37:00,337
She used to lock me 
up and didn't...

1491
01:37:01,067 --> 01:37:04,236
...give me any food for
three days and beat me.

1492
01:37:04,977 --> 01:37:08,464
At last, I was fed up 
and ran away from my country.

1493
01:37:09,363 --> 01:37:12,537
I wandered around 
and came here.

1494
01:37:13,466 --> 01:37:16,207
I came here and 
saw you, mother.

1495
01:37:17,577 --> 01:37:20,237
You are Narendu's step mother.

1496
01:37:20,842 --> 01:37:23,875
But you love him so much...

1497
01:37:25,307 --> 01:37:29,657
I have an ambition.
If God gives me money...

1498
01:37:30,003 --> 01:37:36,503
...I will go to my country and
serve my mother so much...

1499
01:37:36,766 --> 01:37:38,875
That she will 
embrace me and say...

1500
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:43,339
Gul Khan is my real son, 
he is my real son.

1501
01:37:47,014 --> 01:37:48,905
All this has happened 
because of you.

1502
01:37:49,131 --> 01:37:50,160
But what did I do?

1503
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:52,002
Why did you send that money?

1504
01:37:52,172 --> 01:37:53,410
So what sin did I commit?

1505
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:54,899
If there is a illness 
in the house...

1506
01:37:54,924 --> 01:37:56,260
...money can be 
needed at any time.

1507
01:37:56,285 --> 01:37:57,910
Then why did they send 
the money back?

1508
01:37:58,493 --> 01:38:00,926
Your sister-in-law 
is so arrogant.

1509
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,534
If your money was used 
for mother's cure...

1510
01:38:04,566 --> 01:38:06,067
...wouldn't she 
have lost her face?

1511
01:38:06,222 --> 01:38:08,060
Therefore, she has

All this is your 
Navendu brother's tricks.

1514
01:38:15,113 --> 01:38:18,785
His mind is as poisoned
as his words are sweet.

1515
01:38:19,787 --> 01:38:20,612
Poison?

1516
01:38:21,179 --> 01:38:22,179
What else?

1517
01:38:22,612 --> 01:38:24,344
He wants to defame you.

1518
01:38:24,886 --> 01:38:26,652
He wants you have
you fall in people's eyes.

...joblessness and poverty

...step mother 
sister and brother.

1523
01:38:45,413 --> 01:38:46,416
And you...

01:38:47,749 --> 01:38:50,621
Once you got money, 
you left everyone.

See who has come.

1529
01:39:09,993 --> 01:39:10,612
You?

1530
01:39:13,673 --> 01:39:16,284
You got time to meet 
mother after all.

1531
01:39:19,269 --> 01:39:22,260
Mother... 
Viju has come to take you.

1532
01:39:24,432 --> 01:39:25,432
Navendu...

1533
01:39:26,775 --> 01:39:29,535
You have supported 
me all your life.

1534
01:39:32,227 --> 01:39:34,398
Can you not support me
for a couple more days?

1535
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:36,824
Please don't say 
like this, mother.

1536
01:39:37,131 --> 01:39:40,306
You will be cured 
nicely at Viju's house.

1537
01:39:41,031 --> 01:39:43,896
There will be good medicines
and the best of doctors.

1538
01:39:44,222 --> 01:39:45,969
You will be cured 
very quickly, mother.

1539
01:39:46,686 --> 01:39:47,686
No, son.

1540
01:39:48,655 --> 01:39:51,230
That death which I get
in your house is better...

1541
01:39:52,224 --> 01:39:55,100
...than the life that I will
get living in Viju's house.

1542
01:39:59,052 --> 01:40:00,140
I will not go there.

1543
01:40:00,772 --> 01:40:02,717
Why do you hate me 
so much after all?

1544
01:40:03,076 --> 01:40:06,974
What wrong have I done?
Just that I live separate?

1545
01:40:07,351 --> 01:40:09,100
- And that too because...
- No, Viju...

1546
01:40:10,030 --> 01:40:11,686
Not all that.

But whatever you did
with your god like brother...

1548
01:40:19,905 --> 01:40:21,612
For that, forget about 
till I am alive...

1549
01:40:22,539 --> 01:40:25,474
I cannot forgive you for
that even after my death.

1550
01:40:25,756 --> 01:40:29,299
Mother... let it be. 
You are ill.

1551
01:40:29,616 --> 01:40:30,948
Let it be, brother.

1552
01:40:32,076 --> 01:40:34,194
The fire that had to be
ignited has been already.

1555
01:40:38,074 --> 01:40:40,752
The blood which is 
so poisonous...

1556
01:40:41,492 --> 01:40:43,529
...cannot be my blood.
I have given birth...

1557
01:40:44,557 --> 01:40:49,489
...to you with my womb, 
but the truth is...

1558
01:40:49,905 --> 01:40:52,977
...today I am ashamed 
to call you my son.

1559
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:58,167
Go away from here, 
out of my sight!

1560
01:41:06,982 --> 01:41:08,921
Please don't feel bad about 
mother's words, Viju.

1561
01:41:09,664 --> 01:41:13,172
Because of her illness,
she has become so weak...

1562
01:41:13,485 --> 01:41:15,886
...that she cannot tolerate even
a small thing without her wish.

1563
01:41:17,328 --> 01:41:18,908
But this doesn't mean 
that a mother...

1564
01:41:19,135 --> 01:41:21,013
...cannot tolerate 
her own son too.

1565
01:41:21,472 --> 01:41:23,097
Viju... it is just 
a matter of a few days.

1566
01:41:23,425 --> 01:41:26,615
Let mother get cured. I will drop 
her to your house myself.

1567
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:28,789
Keep her at your house for
as many days as you wish.

1568
01:41:29,221 --> 01:41:32,370
Mother will stay with me,
and stay in my house.

01:41:32,885 --> 01:41:34,297
Will you like this, brother?

1570
01:41:35,101 --> 01:41:36,123
What do you mean?

1571
01:41:37,104 --> 01:41:39,417
I know who is doing all this.

1572
01:41:40,513 --> 01:41:43,779
Who has poisoned mother's 
ears against me. You!

Viju...

1574
01:41:44,338 --> 01:41:47,402
Who has ignited the sparks of
hatred in mother's heart. You!

1575
01:41:47,809 --> 01:41:50,217
Who has instigated the
son against the mother.

What are you saying?
Whom are you talking to?

1578
01:41:56,772 --> 01:41:58,251
Think about whatever you say.

1579
01:41:58,504 --> 01:42:00,950
I have thought about 
whatever I am saying.

1580
01:42:01,361 --> 01:42:03,371
It is a sin even to think
like this about brother.

1581
01:42:04,276 --> 01:42:06,947
The brother who ruined 
his life for us...

1582
01:42:07,271 --> 01:42:09,572
...if you cannot give that
brother anything else...

1583
01:42:09,741 --> 01:42:11,378
...at least don't give
him false accusations.

1584
01:42:11,378 --> 01:42:12,593
What kind of accusations?

1585
01:42:12,778 --> 01:42:14,933
Whatever I am saying 
is the truth.

1586
01:42:15,801 --> 01:42:17,698
Do I not have 
a right on mother?

1587
01:42:18,270 --> 01:42:20,152
Can I not do anything 
for my mother?

1588
01:42:21,208 --> 01:42:23,292
Look at yourself 
and see for once.

1589
01:42:24,037 --> 01:42:25,818
What have you done 
for mother till today?

1590
01:42:26,195 --> 01:42:27,785
You got a wife and 
you forgot all of us?

1591
01:42:27,904 --> 01:42:28,809
You forgot everything?

1592
01:42:28,905 --> 01:42:30,943
Why do you nag me about
my wife every now and then?

1593
01:42:31,498 --> 01:42:33,437
I have married. 
I didn't commit any sin.

1594
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:37,913
When a man commits a sin,
only he is punished.

1595
01:42:38,504 --> 01:42:41,821
But when he marries,
the whole house is affected.

1596
01:42:42,641 --> 01:42:44,323
Whether is it good or bad.

1597
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:47,393
If there is a bad effect on the
house due to my marriage...

1598
01:42:48,037 --> 01:42:50,230
...the reason for this could
be the household members too.

1599
01:42:50,255 --> 01:42:51,463

accusing the household...

1600
01:42:51,488 --> 01:42:52,792
...members to hide 
your weaknesses?

Yes, I am not in my 
senses at this time.

why would I come here?

I am going away from here.

to repent one day.

Mother. The teacher sent 
us back from school.

Why did she send you?

Why?

You didn't pay the fees.

He gave us this letter.
And sent us on a holiday.

It is the fees for

When a general manager's
brother will sell fruits...

1750

...and vegetables 
on the streets of...

1751
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:14,061

will be very small.

1752
01:56:15,550 --> 01:56:18,028
I will be defamed, 
I will be insulted...

1753
01:56:19,522 --> 01:56:22,187
Maybe Satyen didn't think...

1754
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:23,720
Satyen thinks a lot.

1755
01:56:24,587 --> 01:56:28,288
And before thinking anything,
living is necessary.

1756
01:56:28,904 --> 01:56:30,624
And earning 
is necessary for life.

1757
01:56:31,068 --> 01:56:33,457
But... but this 
doesn't mean that...

1758

wretched to earn money.

about my respect too?

working under me...

1762

selling fruits and vegetables...

1765

...even I have become 
selfish like you.

No, Satyen...

1767
01:56:49,523 --> 01:56:50,573
I don't understand.

1768
01:56:50,598 --> 01:56:53,614
If you had to do some work,
why didn't you take any job?

1769

every morning and evening.

1772

If there was a need, why didn't 
you ask me for any money?

1773
01:57:04,954 --> 01:57:07,902
If we had to beg,
there is the whole world there.

1774
01:57:08,399 --> 01:57:10,599
Why will we beg to 
a shameless brother?

- Brother.

We will have to stay there.

1786
01:57:43,976 --> 01:57:46,954
I thought that one is
arrogant due to wealth.

1787
01:57:48,196 --> 01:57:52,159
But today... today I can see 
that poverty has pride too.

1788
01:57:53,053 --> 01:57:54,874
The poor people 
have only this wealth.

like their father.

handful of grain from that money.

02:26:03,947 --> 02:26:06,037
My eyes have opened today.

2185
02:26:07,056 --> 02:26:10,585
The curtains on 
my mind have been undone.

2186
02:26:11,562 --> 02:26:13,631
She is not a woman, 
she is a witch.

2187
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:16,851
She separated 
me from my blood.

2188
02:26:17,262 --> 02:26:17,931
Viju...

2189
02:26:18,256 --> 02:26:21,251
The one who repeats the
things of the past is immature.

2190
02:26:21,930 --> 02:26:29,477
Brother... what all you didn't 
do for me. I can't tell you.

2191
02:26:31,262 --> 02:26:32,362
I just know...

2192
02:26:33,822 --> 02:26:37,671
That if I make shoes out of 
my skin and make these feet wear them...

2193
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,262
...even then I cannot
repay your gratitude.

2194
02:26:41,302 --> 02:26:41,863
Silent...

2195
02:26:43,561 --> 02:26:47,800
But now... not any longer, brother.
Not any longer.

2196
02:26:48,222 --> 02:26:49,455
- Inspector...
- Viju.

2197
02:26:49,493 --> 02:26:51,107
- I have hit Satyen...
- Viju shut up.

2198
02:26:51,132 --> 02:26:53,275
No... for my sake...

2199
02:26:58,350 --> 02:26:59,986
DOCTOR: 
Congratulations to all of you.

2200
02:27:01,493 --> 02:27:02,801
Congratulations.

2201
02:27:02,971 --> 02:27:06,537
Mr. Satyen didn't have 
any internal wounds.

2202
02:27:06,965 --> 02:27:08,747
And doctor... the operation...

2203
02:27:08,815 --> 02:27:10,960
That wasn't needed 
and won't be needed too.

2204
02:27:11,088 --> 02:27:12,595
- Where is he?
- He is inside.

2205
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:14,576
- Can we see him?
- Of course.

2206
02:27:15,227 --> 02:27:16,298
INSPECTOR: Just a minute.

2207
02:27:17,348 --> 02:27:21,138
Forgive me. Doctor... till the time 
I don't take his statement...

2208
02:27:21,994 --> 02:27:24,094
...nobody from 
them can meet him.

2209
02:27:24,427 --> 02:27:25,150
Oh! I see.

2210
02:27:26,164 --> 02:27:30,112
Please come out for a minute,
if you don't mind. Come with me.

2211
02:27:32,969 --> 02:27:33,969
Oh God!

2212
02:27:35,194 --> 02:27:37,894
What if Satyen says
anything wrong in anger?

2213
02:27:38,261 --> 02:27:41,474
Don't worry. 
Satyen is temperamental.

2214
02:27:42,129 --> 02:27:43,702
But he is our 
brother after all.

2215
02:27:44,533 --> 02:27:46,039
I am sorry for the trouble.

2216
02:27:46,985 --> 02:27:50,243
But can I ask you 
how you got this wound?

2217
02:27:51,196 --> 02:27:51,798
Yes?

2218
02:27:52,204 --> 02:27:54,522
I want to know who hit you.

2219
02:28:15,992 --> 02:28:18,217
You have some 
misconception, inspector.

2220
02:28:19,663 --> 02:28:20,878
Nobody hit me.

2221
02:28:22,199 --> 02:28:23,212
Then this wound...

2222
02:28:24,039 --> 02:28:24,681
That...

2223
02:28:28,507 --> 02:28:32,715
I was getting down from the stairs,
I slipped and fell down.

2224
02:28:33,927 --> 02:28:35,903
Are you telling the truth?

2225
02:28:38,047 --> 02:28:38,946
I am saying the truth.

2226
02:28:41,616 --> 02:28:42,142
Okay.

2227
02:28:44,506 --> 02:28:45,290
Didn't I tell you?

2228
02:28:46,363 --> 02:28:49,617
Satyen is temperamental.
But he is our brother.

2229
02:28:52,602 --> 02:28:56,028
Brother... brother... 
please forgive me.

2230
02:28:57,031 --> 02:28:58,791
I haven't walked 
on the road of good.

2231
02:28:59,283 --> 02:29:01,267
I have just walked on
the road of my own needs.

2232
02:29:02,170 --> 02:29:03,935
Now, I will walk on your road.

2233
02:29:04,915 --> 02:29:06,424
Please give 
me place in your feet.

2234
02:29:06,576 --> 02:29:08,838
No, daughter-in-law. Get up...

2235
02:29:09,836 --> 02:29:13,759
"A beautiful bungalow
should be made..."

2236
02:29:13,832 --> 02:29:18,083
"A beautiful bungalow
should be made..."

2237
02:29:18,631 --> 02:29:23,251
"All my family members
should live in it."

2238
02:29:23,596 --> 02:29:27,599
"A beautiful bungalow
should be made..."

2239
02:29:28,213 --> 02:29:31,913
"A beautiful bungalow
should be made..."

2240
02:29:33,597 --> 02:29:38,020
"The bungalow of gold,
a settlement of silver..."

2241
02:29:38,547 --> 02:29:42,766
"The bungalow of gold,
a settlement of silver..."

2242
02:29:43,210 --> 02:29:47,258
"It demands for a whole bed."

2243
02:29:47,788 --> 02:29:51,259
"It demands for a whole bed."

2244
02:29:51,672 --> 02:29:56,039
"A beautiful 
and good bungalow."

2245
02:29:56,358 --> 02:30:03,953
"A beautiful bungalow
should be made..."

2246
02:30:04,458 --> 02:30:05,103
Father...

2247
02:30:06,192 --> 02:30:08,099
If only you could see
it with your own eyes.

2248
02:30:09,232 --> 02:30:12,335
There is no one 
who is step today.

2249
02:30:12,633 --> 02:30:17,696
"The Bindiya (forehead dot) will shine,
the garland will be aromatic..."

2250
02:30:18,508 --> 02:30:23,559
"Whether you don't
get sleep or you get it."

2251
02:30:23,882 --> 02:30:29,152
"The collyrium will radiate and
the flowers will exude a fragrance."

2252
02:30:29,697 --> 02:30:35,011
"The collyrium will radiate and
the flowers will exude a fragrance."

2253
02:30:35,539 --> 02:30:40,738
"No matter if he 
gets annoyed with me."

2254
02:30:41,022 --> 02:30:45,531
"The Bindiya (forehead dot) will shine,
the garland will be aromatic..."
