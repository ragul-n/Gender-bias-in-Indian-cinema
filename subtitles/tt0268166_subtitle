1
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,510
Long live the king!

2
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,512
Long live His Highness!

3
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,535
Mercy, Your Highness

4
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,771
Mercy, Your Highness!
- Shut him up!

5
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,333
Killed me! Save me, Your Highness!

6
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,607
Killed me!

7
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,542
General, why is the complainant
being stopped from coming to me?

8
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:31,355
It is against your pride to talk
to every other man, Your Highness

9
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,782
A king and his subject
are like father and son

10
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:39,559
Sher Khan, present the complainant
before me

11
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,967
Tell me.
- We had no rains this year

12
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,908
Searing drought prevails. Our children
are starving. We're in a predicament

13
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,618
Instead of waiving the tax,
we're being burdened even more

14
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,253
What am I hearing, general?

15
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,927
I had ordered for the use of official
treasure, and the foodgrain...

16
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:18,599
in the storehouses to be distributed
among the subjects. Execute the order

17
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,270
Your order will not be executed.
If all the foodgrain are distributed...

18
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,942
the army will starve. If that happens,
who will protect the nation?

19
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,612
Commander, a piece of land
doesn't make a country

20
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:37,612
Citizens make a country. If they
are dead, whom will the army protect?

21
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,158
Your Highness, this is against
administrative policy

22
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:47,625
Swords, not emotions, run a monarchy.
- And the army wields swords

23
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:53,265
How dare you unsheathe the sword
before me? What does this mean?

24
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:58,440
Simple, Your Highness. When a Rajput
unsheathes a sword...

25
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:03,305
he draws it back only after quenching
its thirst for blood

26
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,274
No! No!

27
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,646
This is no time to mourn Queen Mother.
The assassin is on his way here...

28
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,857
for the prince. He wants to ensure
there's no successor to the throne

29
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,188
My son!

30
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:23,460
Kill the Queen and the prince.
- No heir to the throne must live! Go

31
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,667
Be brave. This is the time to
save the only heir of the king

32
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,668
Surround the palace.
No one must escape

33
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:31,059
Let's hide the prince inside the
temple of Lord Ganesh over there

34
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,928
In the temple?
- Yes, Queen Mother. We're surrounded

35
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:40,869
The successor to the throne must live.
For God's sake, heed me. Come on

36
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,248
In this basket

37
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,558
Not to fear, Your Majesty.
Allah will protect him

38
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:08,763
Lord, we leave the prince to You.
- Save my son, Lord

39
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:27,849
Queen Mother, let's split. I will lead
them away. We'll meet at the temple

40
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,284
May Allah protect you

41
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,990
Chief, the horse is abandoned.
- Just one shot killed them both

42
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,389
The prince and the Queen

43
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,941
Hail Lord Ganesh

44
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,838
Lord, grant me my wish

45
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:32,019
A kid.
- Kid...? Let me see

46
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,451
A kid in a basket?
- What a lovely boy

47
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,922
Yes. There must be someone with him.
Let's go out and check

48
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,530
Whose kid is this?
Anyone...?

49
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,532
Quiet now!
- Whose kid is this?

50
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:53,334
Shut up now! Why are you yelling? Who
is going to hear you in this forest?

51
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,877
I've been praying all along.
This kid is mine. The Lord gives me

52
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:04,485
Hey... that's his mark.
- Mark? Hold it dear, all right?

53
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,050
Look...

54
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,893
Queen Mother, the prince is not here.
- What...?

55
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,502
No... no!

56
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,906
Where's my son, my baby?

57
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,572
No! No!

58
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,579
Give me back my son!

59
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:43,690
Be brave, Queen Mother.
Our prince isn't lost

60
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,928
The Almighty has surely placed him
under the care of a noble soul

61
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,927
Look at the fresh flowers.
Had our prince not been safe...

62
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,605
we would've found this place
stained in blood, not flowers

63
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:03,438
Believe me. Some devotee has certainly
visited this place and offered flowers

64
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,745
He must've taken the baby with him.
Trust me

65
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,179
The Almighty cannot be so cruel.
He is merciful and benevolent

66
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:16,950
Pray, son

67
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,620
Where did our chief ind the baby?
- In the temple of Lord Ganesh

68
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,764
The Lord has been kind to him.
- Take a good look at him

69
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:28,630
Recognise him. He's going to be
our tribe's chief after me

70
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,375
Long live the little chief!

71
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,141
Jwala is here

72
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:42,978
Tell my son's future, Santoni

73
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:49,554
Arise, Jwala.
Arise, unravel the mystery!

74
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,793
Predict. Where does he come from?
Why is he here?

75
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:59,804
Suraj (Sun). Your son is Suraj. He
will rule the world when he grows up

76
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:07,009
But you will not live.
You will not live to see that day

77
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:14,608
So what? Every man has to die.
But my son's future is bright

78
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,420
Sire, the Queen and
the prince are dead

79
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,748
Long live, His Majesty Durjan Singh

80
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:37,839
We, your faithful, have assembled here
to proclaim that...

81
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,543
we shall certainly avenge
your martyrdom from the enemy

82
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:47,713
Unless we ind the prince
and restore the throne, we shall...

83
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:53,650
iercely counter the atrocities done
to the poor, under the Queen Mother

84
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:58,052
So that the ires of rebellion burn
forever in the hearts of the people

85
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:03,057
We're rebels. Rebellion is our right.
- Long live the rebellion!

86
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:29,753
"Moti..."

87
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:37,094
"never forget our friendship"

88
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:47,101
"Never forget our friendship..."

89
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:53,908
"my childhood chum, my elephant"

90
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,118
"You could die for me"

91
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:43,483
"You love me"

92
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,456
"You scare everyone
but you are scared of me"

93
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,796
"You are crazy about me..."

94
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,798
"so am I about you"

95
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:05,239
"Never forget our friendship"

96
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,828
"Together we shall play,
together we shall live"

97
00:15:56,222 --> 00:16:03,071
"May not we ever part"

98
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:11,311
"May we never part,
may we never be lonely"

99
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:19,085
"Even if that happens,
may we never stop loving"

100
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:25,494
"Never forget our friendship..."

101
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:34,328
"my childhood chum, my elephant"

102
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,486
That elephant will be good for
the prince's rides. Catch it

103
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:54,622
Why must you?
This elephant belongs to me

104
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:58,019
it's the king's order! Get it?
- Nloti is mine

105
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,696
I won't let anyone touch him.
- Why won't you? Get out of the way!

106
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,764
No! As long as I alive,
no one will touch him

107
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,368
All right, you won't live

108
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,373
Baba!

109
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,313
Vikram, look my son,
there's an elephant for you to ride

110
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,890
See Padma? An elephant for me.
There's not even an ass for you

111
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,793
Sher Khan...
- Yes Your Majesty?

112
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,065
When I saw that kid today...
- Yes...?

113
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:50,404
What state have I come to?
I ind my son in every boy

114
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:06,593
I had put my son under Your care.
You must return him to me

115
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,926
How long will You delay mercy, Lord?

116
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,944
So many years have passed
in the pining to see my son

117
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,448
Where must my son be?

118
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:41,456
What kind of justice is this, Lord?
Even today, a sinner...

119
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,267
is occupying the throne that ought
to have been my son's

120
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,809
Vikram...

121
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:09,119
The king is no more.
The sun has set in Suryagadh

122
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,826
Should the sun set
on one end...

123
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,588
it rises on the other

124
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,966
Hail king Vikram Singh

125
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,303
Hail the Queen Mother

126
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,508
What news do you bring
from the city, Sher Khan?

127
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:35,018
After Durjan Singh, his son
Vikram Singh has succeeded him

128
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,521
And instead of rejoicing,
his subjects wallow in misery

129
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,380
Son turns out to be ruthless
than his father

130
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:46,858
How have the subjects reacted?
- The sword of tyranny silences them

131
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:53,533
I wish, we could tell them that their
Queen and their prince are still alive

132
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,532
But where's the prince?
Who will answer them if they ask?

133
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,708
"Gypsies... we're gypsies"

134
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,318
"Gypsies... we're gypsies"

135
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,248
"We're one of a kind"

136
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,926
"In hearts, we live"

137
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,264
"We make merry among ourselves"

138
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,124
"Like the river, we flow"

139
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,402
"Gypsies"

140
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,204
"We're gypsies"

141
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,872
"We're one of a kind"

142
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,969
"The world laughs over us"

143
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,304
"We laugh over the world"

144
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:20,443
"Today here, there tomorrow,
we pitch in wherever we wish"

145
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:25,483
"We exchange hearts for hearts,
we live and die for love"

146
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,916
"We're lovers..."

147
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,984
"we're lovers, we're Iovestruck"

148
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,361
"Gypsies..."

149
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,257
"we're gypsies..."

150
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,896
"We're one of a kind"

151
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:54,441
"We use our hands to work,
we use words to entertain"

152
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,340
"Rainy days, we fear..."

153
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,184
"but not along night of love"

154
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,510
"We aren't mean friends"

155
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:07,221
"Flowers, we cherish"

156
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,457
"Thorns..."

157
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,353
"even thorns we accept"

158
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,687
"Gypsies..."

159
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,591
"we're gypsies"

160
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:32,471
Attention! Princess Padmavati's
royal carriage is on its way

161
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,580
Clear the village square

162
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,227
Why are you running off?
- The princess is coming this way!

163
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,508
Run, if you want to live.
- What if I wish to see the princess?

164
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,833
Your eyes will be gouged out!

165
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,446
Amar, come on! You want to die?
- No, I want to see the princess

166
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:09,844
Come on!

167
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,332
Closed buggy...?

168
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,694
Her Majesty is inside the buggy

169
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,641
I thought you were ugly, that's why
you prefer to stay inside the buggy

170
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,144
But you are so pretty.
- Anybody there? Arrest him!

171
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,785
It's so crowded here.
I'll come to meet you in private

172
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,125
Insolence!
Who is this man?

173
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,724
Easy...!
- They've been ruthless

174
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:22,095
Why did you have to go there?
- Shallo...

175
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,671
how many marks on my back?
- Many

176
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:30,410
The whip marks on my body
shows how much she loves me

177
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:35,643
Loves...? Who? The princess?
- Who else? You?

178
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:41,123
Stay in your limits. Her brother,
Vikram Singh, is a tyrant

179
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,789
If you try to meet her,
he'll slit your throat

180
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:54,128
If the swine cuts my throats, the
princess will kill herself my for sake

181
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:59,132
As if you are married to her!
- Almost. I have chosen her

182
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,808
She's going to choose me now,
and then we'll be married bylaw

183
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:09,143
If you go there tomorrow, your heart
will bear as many wounds as your back

184
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,819
She's burning in envy,
and she's trying to burn me

185
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:19,618
Stay in your limits, son.
Why must you take on the royals?

186
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:23,695
Who's taking them on, Ma?
Her men flagged me. In fact...

187
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,024
they've challenged your tiger, Ma

188
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:31,864
And what a wounded tiger does,
I must show Her Majesty

189
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,672
Why must you stake your life
for him, Shallo?

190
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:44,851
Sarju! I'm marrying Amar. You get it?
- But he isn't marrying you

191
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:48,954
Someday he's going to dump you. Then
you'll come to me. So why not today?

192
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:53,525
I'd rather drown myself!
- Only if I let you die

193
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,854
I'll take you away by force!
- Let go of my hand!

194
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,862
Don't you dare, Sarju!
You ought to be ashamed

195
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,865
Ashamed? What for?
I'm proposing marriage

196
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:07,940
You know the rules of our clan.
No marrying a girl against her wishes

197
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:16,751
One is also allowed to talk to
spinsters. Stop me after you marry her

198
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:21,883
Whether I marry her or not, but
till such time as I am the chief...

199
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:27,220
I won't let anyone force a girl.
Shallo, go away

200
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:34,294
"Look at her..."

201
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,095
"setting water on ire"

202
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,973
Who's there?

203
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:51,642
"Covering her body..."

204
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:57,312
"the fair lady is taking a bath"

205
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:03,088
How dare you? Uncouth man!
Don't you know who I am?

206
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:08,528
"Are you a celestial beauty?"

207
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:14,335
"Or, are you someone else?"

208
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:19,497
"You aren't woman"

209
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:25,347
"You are a silken thread"

210
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,612
Fool! You think I'm thread?
Moron!

211
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:35,354
You have invited your death!
- Death...? So beautiful?

212
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,755
I could die for such a snakebite

213
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,943
"You're a serpent"

214
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,947
"And I'm snake-charmer in love"

215
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,951
"I shall lure you away..."

216
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:14,387
"and leave the world gaping"

217
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,103
You aren't getting away alive
out of the palace!

218
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:13,449
"Guard yourself as much as you can"

219
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,719
"Cover yourself as much as you can"

220
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,795
"But don't be so vain"

221
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:25,601
"Don't deny this poor heart"

222
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:29,865
"My heart is no less than a palace..."

223
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,969
"for, in my heart you dwell"

224
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:38,073
"You're a serpent"

225
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:42,043
"And I'm snake-charmer in love"

226
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,751
"I shall lure you away..."

227
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,724
"and leave the world gaping"

228
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:07,507
You'll die a horrible death!
- "Those in love..."

229
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,511
"don't fear death"

230
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:24,119
"For your lovely countenance..."

231
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,089
"a thousand moons could die"

232
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,127
"Your disheveled tresses..."

233
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:36,131
"could plunge the world into darkness"

234
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:40,135
"You're a serpent"

235
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:44,139
"And I'm snake-charmer in love"

236
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,881
"I shall lure you away..."

237
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:51,550
"and leave the world gaping"

238
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,477
"if not today, tomorrow it will be"

239
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:23,910
"Let's bet on it"

240
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:28,149
"Love will cast its spell on you..."

241
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,153
"and you will dance in joy"

242
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:36,258
"For a smile on your lips..."

243
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:40,331
"I'd drink your venom"

244
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:44,270
"You're a serpent"

245
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:48,305
"And I'm snake-charmer in love"

246
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:52,045
"I shall lure you away..."

247
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,941
"and leave the world gaping"

248
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:22,305
Disperse! it's such a lovely moment.
Her Majesty hates this intrusion

249
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:26,377
You'll be punished for this intrusion.
- Did you hear? You'll be punished!

250
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,777
What are you waiting for? Arrest him!
- What are you waiting for? Arrest me

251
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,389
Didn't hear? She wants me arrested.
She wants me to stay here

252
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:37,319
What...?
- You've fallen in love at irst sight

253
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,323
I must return. Now that I have chosen
a pretty bride for myself...

254
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,023
I want to break the good news to Ma.
- Insolent!

255
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:45,357
Thank you

256
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:54,367
Excuse me... my headdress is with you.
Take care of it, I'll return for it

257
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,005
Kill him!

258
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:34,181
He escaped? How could he?
Tell the soldiers...

259
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:38,386
if they want to live, they must
bring him to me, dead or alive

260
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,417
Alive, if possible

261
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:46,059
Why bother the soldiers,
Your Highness? He'll come on his own

262
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:50,728
He promised to come here, and he came.
He'll come again for the headdress

263
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,999
He's a man of his word.
- Shut up!

264
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:03,412
My hot babe, out of my way.
- To hell with your hot-babe!

265
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,443
Did you meet the princess?
Are you satisied?

266
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:12,550
Of course, satisied. And I'm frozen.
- Why? Does she have four eyes?

267
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,551
Four hands? Four legs? Four ears?
- She has four hearts

268
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,417
What...?
- Yes. One heart says...

269
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,356
Amar, don't leave me

270
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,427
The second says, Amar, embrace me

271
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28,135
Third says...
- Stop it! Your brain is rusted

272
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,136
What has she got that I haven't?
Is she diamond-eyed? Silken-haired?

273
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,445
Do flowers rain when she speaks?
- Yes. Roses

274
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:41,114
She smells like sandalwood.
Today we even bathed together

275
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:44,248
You bathed with her?
- Yes, in the royal pool

276
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:48,456
Take a whiff. You'll smell sandalwood.
- Don't touch me. You've bathed...

277
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,784
with someone else. You're stained.
Unless you bathe in the Ganges...

278
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,586
the stink won't leave your body.
- I won't ever bathe. Never

279
00:40:55,954 --> 00:41:02,564
Lest this lovely fragrance leaves me.
- It appears, you're off your wits

280
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,806
Come on, drop me home.
- No, you aren't sitting...

281
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,610
on my horse any more. Only she
will sit. I'll ride only with her

282
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:14,474
You will marry only me. I'm going
to mother your kids. You get that?

283
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,251
I have no plans to become father now.
Lay off

284
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,609
Goodness!

285
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:24,048
Lord, what am I to do?
Wasn't he so ine a while ago?

286
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:31,824
Princess, our army is amazing.
A man teased you at the pool...

287
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,626
and they picked up twenty men.
Go and identify the lover...

288
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,031
I mean, the rogue

289
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,529
it's none of them

290
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,668
Her Majesty says the offender
is not among them

291
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,737
Let them go.
- Let them go. By order

292
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,099
Wait!

293
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:24,286
Those who are arrested and brought to
me, don't return without a punishment

294
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:28,386
But brother, they are guiltless.
Why must you punish them?

295
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,692
One must fear the curse of the poor.
- Swords run a monarchy!

296
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:38,228
Otherwise, a monarchy
loses the power it wields

297
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,968
So these are the ones who dared
to enter our pool!

298
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,904
It's a lie, Your Highness.
We are innocent. Your soldiers...

299
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,581
brought us here by force
- You mean, my soldiers...

300
00:42:55,907 --> 00:43:01,323
cannot differentiate between the
guilty and innocent? I trust my army

301
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:06,561
You trust your army but not your
subjects? This is unfair, Your Majesty

302
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,728
You suspect my justice?
- No, Your Highness

303
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,035
We're merely voicing our anger
against the army

304
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:20,936
The voice reeks of rebellion.
Soldier, silence the voice

305
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,808
Mercy, Your Highness. Mercy!

306
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,682
Has anyone else
to question my justice?

307
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,959
Take them away.
Throw them in the dungeons

308
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:47,297
So that their spiteful eyes
pine to see the sun

309
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,202
Come on

310
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,631
Where are they from?
- Village Gangapur, Your Highness

311
00:43:52,964 --> 00:44:00,075
Uncivil men. Gangapur will not be my
territory any more. Execute the order

312
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,606
She's stranded. Get her. Go

313
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:18,660
Son, were it not for you he'd have
shot me. You have given me...

314
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:24,126
a new lease of life. Who are you?
- I'm Amar, the gypsy...

315
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:28,869
Well, I'm no prince that you'll know.
- You're very brave

316
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,765
You're very brave, Ma-ji.
You were great with the sword

317
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,542
May I say something, Ma-ji?
- Tell me, son

318
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:41,677
I don't why I feel like
touching your feet

319
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:51,827
We need brave men like you.
Join us

320
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:57,791
Please don't mind... what do you do?
- We're rebels

321
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:03,367
Rebels...? Good Lord! That demands
bloodshed. You must be killing many

322
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:07,175
What we gypsies do is just sing and
dance. Keep this, it might hurt

323
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:15,050
Goodbye, Ma-ji.
- Bless you, son

324
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:27,055
One bandit, a woman, defeats
such a huge kingdom

325
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:31,659
And all of you have come to me alive
with this news?

326
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:36,402
I feel like skinning you alive
and hanging you at the square

327
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:42,874
But then, warriors should not be
humiliated before the subjects

328
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:52,085
Commander, let my favourite elephant
trample all these brave men

329
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:56,889
At least they will die respectfully.
Execute the order

330
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:11,237
Past, present, future... manifest!
- Bibi Amma...

331
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:17,107
What is it?
- My lover doesn't talk to me any more

332
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:23,577
He has forgotten his childhood love
ever since he has met the princess

333
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:29,784
When will he marry me?
- Marry? Abracadabra!

334
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:37,931
This girl loves someone. He is
indifferent. Tell me the consequence

335
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:46,807
Showers of blood... ires...
destruction... nothing will be spared

336
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:50,943
Nothing will exist...
no throne, no crown

337
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:57,151
What will happen to my love?
- Will be decided on a full-moon night

338
00:47:57,842 --> 00:48:01,346
Go and wait for the full moon.
Go away!

339
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:18,973
Pining,
I'm restless every moment

340
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:25,748
During the day I dream about my love,
and at nights I can't sleep

341
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,172
Lady, I'm here

342
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,786
How could you enter the palace?
- I came flying, counting on my love

343
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,853
Insolent! You came again?
I will clip your wings!

344
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:41,493
And hold them close to your heart.
- I'll ix you rightaway

345
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,969
Before you call someone in,
won't you accept your birthday gift?

346
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:56,743
Your lover has come to meet you.
And I bring you a pair of rabbits

347
00:48:57,635 --> 00:49:01,549
Don't be surprised. Learn from them
the only thing that they teach

348
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:06,354
Make love and have kids

349
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,389
Take care

350
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:12,561
Go ahead, summon anyone

351
00:49:17,922 --> 00:49:19,833
Arrest this savage!

352
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:22,564
Quick!

353
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:34,442
Will you use arrows and swords to
kill a lover? Kill me with love

354
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:42,053
Catch me if you can

355
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:46,255
I hate a crowd. I'll meet you
in private. Pretty soon

356
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,397
Arrest him and present him before me

357
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,983
What happened? Has he been caught?
- No, none could catch him

358
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:54,990
He jumped the wall and ran away.
- Ran away? Useless! All of you

359
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,130
I don't need anyone. Go away.
- Me too?

360
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,871
Yes, you too

361
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,344
Useless! Everyone!

362
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:24,258
Thank you for this lovely gift,
Your Highness

363
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:28,358
You...? How dare you lie on my bed?

364
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:35,160
You mind? In this very bed
we shall have our nuptials someday

365
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:40,702
Not a bed for nuptials,
it's your deathbed

366
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:54,152
Not dagger, nor sword can harm me.
My arms have taken all

367
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:58,756
It seems you don't love your life.
- You are my life

368
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:03,054
How will I survive without loving you?
- Only if you live

369
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:09,065
A human can kill another, Your Majesty.
But to kill love is beyond human hands

370
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:13,398
It is love that gave me the courage to
come here and return alive everytime

371
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,772
Like a thief you entered and left.
And you think you've been courageous?

372
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:23,448
Don't challenge a lover's courage!
If I wish I can take you away now

373
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:29,786
But I won't. On full-moon nights you
visit the temple on the hill, I hear

374
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:35,094
Make sure you come with the
entire Red Army. I'll come alone

375
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:40,095
If I whisk you away from amidst all
the soldiers, then you will have to...

376
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:45,430
shed your false pride
and embrace this gypsy. Agree?

377
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:52,444
Only if your head remains.
- Not you, the high of royalty speaks

378
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:59,448
For a while forget that you are
a princess, and look into your heart

379
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:06,452
You'll ind me in some corner.
And... you must give in to your heart

380
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:11,122
No, I won't return this.
My foster-sister is marrying today

381
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:15,460
I'll tell her that her sister-in-law
has sent this gift for her

382
00:53:18,162 --> 00:53:23,805
My headdress is lucky, I'm not. Look
how majestically it lies on your seat

383
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:31,751
Take care of this weapon. You may
need it on the full-moon night. Bye

384
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:58,175
Look into your heart. You will
ind me in some corner. And...

385
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:01,676
you must give in to your heart

386
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:08,752
You threw the headdress away, but
how will you get over his memories?

387
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:12,892
Memories? Of the tumbler?
- All right he is a tumbler

388
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:17,529
But his jumps have
set your heart somersaulting

389
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:28,339
Well, my hot babe looks frozen today

390
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:31,202
Today it will be decided!
- Has the war begun?

391
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:33,537
Yes, the war has begun!
I'll kill you or I'll kill myself

392
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:36,215
You're coming from there, aren't you?
- Shallo, I can't help it

393
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,248
I don't go there, my legs take me

394
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,217
And now, even the princess' condition
is like mine. She's pining

395
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:47,222
She wasn't willing to let me go today.
- Then why did you return?

396
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,555
You could've stayed back?
- Can't digest the food...

397
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:53,892
when it comes on a golden platter.
Until I eat the food you cook...

398
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:57,933
I'm not sated. After I marry
the princess, make sure...

399
00:54:58,262 --> 00:55:02,108
you teach her to make bread.
- Must you rub salts into my wounds?

400
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:06,246
If you want to marry that cursed woman
then take this and pierce my heart

401
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:12,248
What's wrong with you? You think
I'll thrust this knife into you?

402
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:14,749
I don't want your sympathies

403
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:20,927
Does she love you more than I do?
- Yes... she loves me... dearly

404
00:55:21,285 --> 00:55:24,266
She calls me "My Romeo" these days

405
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:29,161
Swear it on me

406
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:38,371
No Shallo, I can't
swear falsely on you

407
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:45,284
Amar! I knew you can't
swear falsely on me. You love me

408
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:50,285
You won't even stab me! You want to
tease me that's why you take her name

409
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:54,289
But I'm not buying that!
- Don't dream unrealistic dreams

410
00:55:54,618 --> 00:56:00,796
Say whatever you want to,
I'll get even with you after marriage

411
00:56:08,632 --> 00:56:10,339
She's hurting herself

412
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:33,660
Stop

413
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:45,341
Bravo! Now you are capable
of taking on the enemy

414
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:49,344
What you have learnt, teach that
to the neighbouring villagers

415
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:55,021
Let them teach others. Finally
every village will become a fortress...

416
00:56:55,346 --> 00:56:58,691
and every young man, a warrior

417
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:01,493
Princess, are you going to the temple
tomorrow with the soldiers?

418
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:06,358
What is it about tomorrow?
- The gypsy. The one who promises...

419
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:11,036
to come, comes,
goes back and returns again

420
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:15,370
What do you think? Will he come?
Doesn't he hold his life dear?

421
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:19,374
The text of Love says that true lovers
don't hesitate to give their lives

422
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:23,408
Basanti, talking about love and
sacriicing life for love...

423
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:27,712
are two different things.
He isn't coming

424
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:34,158
My darling Raja, know why I am
decking you up tonight?

425
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:40,401
Get the plan very clear. Today
the princess is going to ride on you

426
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:44,729
Don't mess it up,
else I'll whack you. Let's go

427
00:58:01,745 --> 00:58:03,622
He's not to be seen.
- Who?

428
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:08,920
The one who always promises to come.
- He isn't coming. Poor Life is dear

429
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,368
So the Love texts lie that true lovers
don't hesitate to give their lives

430
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:17,871
It is true! He is here!

431
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,064
It's a dummy.
- That's a dummy!

432
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:49,600
The cheat! Coward! See? Talking
about love and sacriicing for love...

433
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,000
are two different things.
- Here! My life is for you, princess

434
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:59,037
Gypsies are true to their word.
Those foolish soldiers can't kill me

435
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:03,340
If you wanted to kill me,
you should've brought in cannons

436
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:07,153
Not like a thief, I'll take you away
amidst flying arrows

437
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:10,080
How will you ride?
On elephant? Or horseback?

438
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:16,220
Horseback will be the best!
Raja! Take the girl!

439
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:18,959
Halt!

440
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:25,299
No one tries to step forward!
Inform your king that...

441
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:28,075
Her Majesty has gone to see
her in-laws

442
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:46,850
Faster!

443
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,646
Jump, Raja!

444
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:28,893
Don't worry, Your Majesty,
your soldiers are sluggish

445
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:34,698
Amar...?

446
01:00:34,898 --> 01:00:38,175
Insolent man! You'll know
when I get you hanged!

447
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:44,118
Hang me after the wedding,
I won't mind. But you must marry me

448
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,921
With the princess...?

449
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:53,520
Stop, Amar!
- Shallo, out of the way!

450
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:57,922
Where are you taking that witch? Stop!
- We're marrying today

451
01:00:58,622 --> 01:01:01,535
Summon the priest, pronto.
- Stop, Amar! No!

452
01:01:01,925 --> 01:01:06,340
Stop, Amar!
- Her Majesty wants sweet distributed

453
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:09,735
I'll kill her!
Stop!

454
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:27,256
Stop, Raja. Our castle is here

455
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:30,962
Well Your Majesty,
you like the place?

456
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,297
Come on, darling

457
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:45,772
What grace! The gypsy girl
is no better than you

458
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:50,208
And why not? A gypsy's company
does show its effect

459
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:55,087
Raja, did you enjoy taking the
princess on a ride?

460
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:59,089
And why not?
Both of us enjoyed

461
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,451
Well, do you commend
my act of bravery?

462
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:04,629
You kidnapped a girl using deception,
and you call that an act of bravery?

463
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:07,662
If not an act of bravery,
it is a tactic in love

464
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:13,202
This battle of war between you and me
has made me Iovesick, Your Majesty

465
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:18,712
And only wedding can cure me. So
tell me, do you like the bridegroom?

466
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:23,277
Do you intend to taint a girl
in this desolate ruins?

467
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:27,553
What a shame! This doesn't
speak well of you, princess

468
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:32,824
You consider my love a slur on you?
You ought to be proud of my love

469
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:35,823
I stole you away from amidst soldiers
risking my life. Didn't you see?

470
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:40,030
I had promised you. Remember?
I have fulilled my promise

471
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:43,027
Now fulill your promise
and embrace me

472
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,472
You dare to speak such things
because I'm in your custody

473
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:51,642
Who is in whose custody?
You or I?

474
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:56,313
I'm in your custody at the moment.
Entrapped in the shackles of your love

475
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,846
I swear by you,
I love the shackles

476
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:07,318
Still, if you think my love for you is
a crime, I'm willing to be punished

477
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:13,558
Punishment? I wish I had a sword.
Your head would've been at my feet

478
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:17,830
Is that all you wish?

479
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:22,066
I'm in love with you, so I shall
give you every wish of yours

480
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:27,076
My life isn't dearer to me
than your love, Your Majesty

481
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,089
Here you are

482
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,022
Have your wish

483
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:54,598
Shoot the arrow. Go on

484
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,606
Go on, shoot!

485
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:03,448
What are waiting for? Curse
my mother's milk if I waver one bit

486
01:04:04,908 --> 01:04:06,114
Shoot!

487
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,859
You can't shoot, princess

488
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:17,926
Not the worst of your rage
can diminish my love

489
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:22,695
Those lovely eyes, fluttering lips,
those shivering arms...

490
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:28,135
all prove that your heart
has begun rebelling for me

491
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:31,942
If not me, you must listen
to your rebelling heart

492
01:04:32,836 --> 01:04:34,747
Shoot, or embrace me

493
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:38,847
Shoot, or embrace me!
- Insolent! Blood gypsy!

494
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:54,568
Now that you have shot the arrow, you
have made me aware of where I stand

495
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:02,173
A speck of dirt that tried to reach
for the stars has got its punishment

496
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:07,808
That a princess would love a gypsy
was just a misconception I had

497
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:13,377
Thank you for making me aware
of my status

498
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:30,702
Raja, drop the princess safely
at the palace

499
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:36,370
Please...

500
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:53,423
What are you looking at?

501
01:05:56,219 --> 01:06:00,759
Not a wound,
it is my love's grave...

502
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:05,637
in which I have buried
all my desires and dreams

503
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:13,237
Go on, princess. No gypsy
will ever come in your way again

504
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:29,320
"My beauty..."

505
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:35,654
"made me arrogant"

506
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:43,327
"Your love..."

507
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,333
"shattered..."

508
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:53,781
"that image"

509
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:06,350
"With the world
and its people..."

510
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:12,163
"today I revolt..."

511
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:17,367
"now that I have fallen
in love with you"

512
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:22,173
"I'm in love with you"

513
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:32,376
"ls today the day ofjudgement?"

514
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:38,153
"Such mercy you show towards me"

515
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:43,395
"You have fallen in love with me"

516
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:13,658
"You are a princess,
you reside in a castle"

517
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:19,430
"I'm 893/P53/1
a rustic"

518
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:24,969
"My crown..."

519
01:09:25,428 --> 01:09:28,671
"I lay at your feet,
I'm crazed"

520
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:39,946
"Those who weigh feelings
with wealth..."

521
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:45,016
"are merchants who trade in hearts"

522
01:09:45,448 --> 01:09:50,796
"I'm in love with you"

523
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:24,158
"I have forgotten all the norms..."

524
01:10:31,494 --> 01:10:33,496
"everything I accept"

525
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:44,115
"I never knew, desires..."

526
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:49,115
"turn one impulsive"

527
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:54,518
"I have fallen in love with you"

528
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:36,126
"Make me or break me..."

529
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:42,339
"I'm a caged bird,
do what you want to me, O'hunter"

530
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:53,910
"My disheveled tresses,
my fluttering veil..."

531
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:58,692
"invite you..."

532
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:04,589
"now that I have fallen
in love with you"

533
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:18,612
"With the world,
with the people..."

534
01:12:19,302 --> 01:12:23,375
"today we revolt"

535
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:29,280
"I'm in love with you"

536
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,718
"I'm in love with you"

537
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:45,298
Brother, I'm guilty. I ought to
be punished. You have no right...

538
01:12:45,628 --> 01:12:48,700
to take an innocent's life.
- I'm not here to demand my right

539
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:53,310
I only want to make you aware that
your place is in the palace...

540
01:12:53,636 --> 01:12:58,984
not among the gypsies. You will
not step out of the palace any more

541
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:06,993
Which means I am under house arrest?
- No. I'm just guarding royal honour

542
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:14,324
Brother, you can conine my body,
but you can't shackle my soul

543
01:13:15,425 --> 01:13:20,135
A princess trying to defend a gypsy?
Don't you care for your royal status?

544
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:25,846
For me to shun my pride, the ordinary
gypsy ought to have something in him

545
01:13:26,269 --> 01:13:29,682
Which is why he will be beheaded
and his head presented to you

546
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:35,013
To prevent a princess
trade the royal status...

547
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:38,689
we earned by the edge of the sword

548
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:46,758
Take the princess away safely

549
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:46,556
Shallo...?
- You recognise me?

550
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:53,262
You lured Amar and got him arrested.
Are you satisied now?

551
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:57,761
Who is satisied and who is burning,
how would you know, Shallo?

552
01:14:58,528 --> 01:15:04,444
Love knows not deceit.
- Love? How'd a rich princess know?

553
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:08,781
Love is heart's treasure.
And a heart, we poor posses

554
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:14,511
You have destroyed my love.
I shall have your blood

555
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:19,589
Were my death to save Amar's life
I'd love to die

556
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:26,592
Shallo, if you really love Amar,
forget me and save his life

557
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:33,474
Take me out of this place. We must
get to the dungeon and save Amar

558
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:39,144
Another deceit, another ploy.
- Don't call pining a ploy, Shallo

559
01:15:39,502 --> 01:15:45,817
Pining in your heart? Ask the heart
which pines for Amar since childhood

560
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:52,384
Amar's voice resonates in every
heartbeat. I'm only a sculpture

561
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:57,525
Amar is my soul.
- Then help me save the soul

562
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:02,636
Shallo, if we are late, in this
battle, Time will defeat Love

563
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,633
Whose love do you mean?
Yours? Or mine?

564
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,469
Shallo, this is no time to argue
but to save Amar

565
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:15,578
He must live, no matter if he
becomes yours... but help me, Shallo

566
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:22,346
If this be deceit, I'm willing
to accept this beautiful deceit

567
01:16:22,845 --> 01:16:24,449
But on one condition

568
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:30,524
After Amar is released he will
belong to me, not to you

569
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:34,057
To save Amar's life,
I accept any condition

570
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,064
Then come on

571
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,552
Open

572
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:21,677
Your command, Your Majesty?
- Open the gate

573
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:25,341
I can open it only on official order

574
01:17:25,675 --> 01:17:29,248
isn't a princess' order not official?
- I'm helpless, Your Majesty

575
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,647
Hand over the prisoner to me.
It's an order

576
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:35,087
Every prisoner is under the king's
custody. I'd rather lose my life...

577
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:38,592
than betray.
- Then you'll lose your life!

578
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:41,731
Your Majesty, don't compel me
to use force

579
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:44,093
Shallo, pick up the keys.
- Don't allow her!

580
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,343
Shallo, quick!

581
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:07,150
Move!

582
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:12,557
Take this!

583
01:18:47,857 --> 01:18:49,894
Get out of here, quick!
- Come on

584
01:19:16,519 --> 01:19:18,226
Don't let them escape!

585
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:27,640
Do as I say. The two of you
get out of here

586
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:30,704
And you?
- Not wise for all of us to go at once

587
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:32,842
I'll go this way

588
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:39,151
Your Highness, the gypsy has escaped

589
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:49,853
Someone is coming. Go on, I'll see

590
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:59,499
Did you catch the girl, too?
- No. She was shot, yet she escaped

591
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:06,977
Shallo?
- Shallo, my child!

592
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:15,085
I regret, those wrists that once wore
golden bangles wear iron handcuffs now

593
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:21,754
I'm not responsible but your wrong
step that maligned royal reputation

594
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:27,090
To each his own thoughts. You think
I maligned the royal reputation

595
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:31,431
But I think I have honoured love

596
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:36,771
Now that I've freed Amar from your
shackles, I care not for handcuffs

597
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,243
Nlisconception? it's your
misconception that Amar is free

598
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:49,287
None escapes Death. Likewise, no prey
escapes king Vikram's Singh's custody

599
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:53,457
Amar is still my prisoner.
And tomorrow morning...

600
01:20:53,816 --> 01:20:58,458
you will witness the bloody scene
when he will be done to death

601
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:02,802
Death...?
- Yes, death. Tell me...

602
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:07,904
if you have a greater punishment
on your mind, I'll consider it

603
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:16,875
Half a glass? Fill it!
I'm the chief now

604
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:20,983
Not yet, boss. Yes, you will become
the chief after Amar's death

605
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,312
Not so long before he dies

606
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:31,759
Don't you know? No prey has ever
escaped king Vikram Singh's trap

607
01:21:32,021 --> 01:21:36,492
And the slut went to save him!
- Boss, Shallo will be yours now

608
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:41,965
If not me, who else will
the slut belong to?

609
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:45,972
My Amar's life is in danger.
Save him Bibi Amma, I beg of you

610
01:21:46,335 --> 01:21:52,843
No use begging to me. Look up,
the Goddess needs blood, a sacriice

611
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:57,850
Then offer me. Let my blood quench
the Goddess' thirst. Save my Amar

612
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:03,186
No one can save him. No one can
save him from the Goddess' wrath

613
01:22:04,186 --> 01:22:08,601
Love can save him.
My love can take on any tempest

614
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,337
Don't take on this tempest,
you will lose your life

615
01:22:12,695 --> 01:22:17,007
I'll give it! I'll sing, dance
and I shall earn the Goddess' favour

616
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:21,873
Don't! Don't do it, Shallo. This is
a harsh test. Not only your life...

617
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:24,980
you will have to sacriice
your love too

618
01:22:35,918 --> 01:22:38,899
"Tonight
I shall give away my love..."

619
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:42,928
"and also give a test"

620
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:47,869
"Not only the heart..."

621
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:52,235
"I can give my life too"

622
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:11,721
"I shall sacriice my life
for this crazy heart of mine"

623
01:23:12,254 --> 01:23:18,068
"I shall sing and dance
till my dancing-bells shatter"

624
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:54,103
"I have been deceived"

625
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:57,576
"Don't stop me tonight"

626
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:03,540
"The tears I shed
didn't work for me"

627
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:07,050
"I have lamented enough"

628
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,114
"Tonight I shall bare my heart..."

629
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:13,321
"to show my wounds"

630
01:24:13,682 --> 01:24:19,428
"I shall sing and dance
until my dancing-bells shatter"

631
01:25:08,304 --> 01:25:12,377
"My luck doesn't favour me"

632
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:19,191
"it's beyond my control"

633
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:30,869
"No matter how weak women are..."

634
01:25:31,193 --> 01:25:34,037
"but we aren't cowards"

635
01:25:34,396 --> 01:25:39,903
"Alone I shall take on the world"

636
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:46,409
"I shall sing and dance
until my dancing-bells shatter"

637
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:52,001
General, pronounce his crime

638
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:58,809
The accused Amar is the gypsy chief

639
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:03,387
Not only did he dare to sneak into
the palace on the sly...

640
01:28:03,712 --> 01:28:07,023
he also committed the crime of
entering into the princess' rest-room

641
01:28:07,716 --> 01:28:14,463
But for the merciful Her Majesty,
her guards would've beheaded him

642
01:28:14,823 --> 01:28:20,239
Her Majesty ordered him to be
detained for sometime

643
01:28:21,196 --> 01:28:25,042
But this ingrate took undue advantage
of her leniency and tried...

644
01:28:25,367 --> 01:28:29,372
to escape from the prison
with the help of some accomplices

645
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:35,653
But our guards risked their lives
and foiled his attempt

646
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:40,458
Has the princess proposed
another punishment?

647
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:42,056
Yes

648
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:50,066
She wants this ingrate to be
trampled under an elephant in public

649
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:01,076
Princess Padmavati's justice
makes me happy

650
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:08,350
But before her order is executed,
according to the kingdom's law...

651
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:11,087
ask the criminal his last wish

652
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:17,092
Speak, if you have any last wish

653
01:29:20,222 --> 01:29:25,103
If you boast of giving me
my last wish, then hear...

654
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:30,402
I want to see the
brave and pretty face...

655
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:35,104
that helped me escape.
- Impossible

656
01:29:35,771 --> 01:29:40,777
Gypsy, know your status!
- Where does a great king stand...

657
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:45,489
who can't fulill a small promise?
- lnsolence! Behave yourself!

658
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:50,729
Don't you fear Death?
- Death, I embraced...

659
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:56,125
the day I desired her love,
whom you have bound in shackles

660
01:29:56,491 --> 01:30:00,735
The moment you breathe your last,
the shackles will break by themselves

661
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:08,138
Thanks for the comprehension. But you
can't see the tears of a helpless soul

662
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:13,152
The tears will rejoice after you die.
- You are mistaken, Your Highness

663
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:19,660
You don't know, those tears of love
will turn into a tempest someday

664
01:30:20,649 --> 01:30:24,620
It will wash away the kingdom of an
arrogant and heartless king like you

665
01:30:24,953 --> 01:30:27,160
No more shall
the crown and throne be

666
01:30:27,489 --> 01:30:30,470
The rule, the false grandeur
will be destroyed

667
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:35,831
None of you shall live, Your Highness.
But love will forever live!

668
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:37,507
Trample him!

669
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,875
Trample his head

670
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:23,979
No!

671
01:31:37,225 --> 01:31:38,795
Moti...? it's you!

672
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:40,763
It's me

673
01:31:48,704 --> 01:31:51,583
it's me. Your buddy. Remember me?

674
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:21,443
Don't let him escape!

675
01:33:23,832 --> 01:33:27,245
After him! I want him.
Dead or alive!

676
01:34:08,243 --> 01:34:09,517
Your Majesty...

677
01:34:17,852 --> 01:34:19,058
Amar escaped

678
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:21,196
Amar is safe

679
01:34:27,629 --> 01:34:30,405
How could he escape?
- A group of wild elephants...

680
01:34:30,732 --> 01:34:32,734
blocked our path, Your Highness

681
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:40,751
General, this means our animals
are smarter than our army

682
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:46,588
But where will he go?
To his clan

683
01:34:47,215 --> 01:34:53,564
General, destroy the gypsies.
Kill every gypsy kid

684
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:59,434
Behead the rebel and present it
before me. Do it!

685
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:08,610
Where is Amar?
- The king's elephant sauced him

686
01:35:08,937 --> 01:35:10,439
No, he is alive.
- Amar is alive...?

687
01:35:10,572 --> 01:35:12,449
He is on the run.
- My son is alive?

688
01:35:12,574 --> 01:35:17,956
Yes, he's alive. I have come looking
for him. Vacate this place

689
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,451
Else, the king's army
will slaughter you

690
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:25,158
They are here I guess. If they see me
I'll be damned. Run, everyone!

691
01:35:25,487 --> 01:35:29,264
Let's get out of here. Come on, Shalu
- I'm not going

692
01:35:29,624 --> 01:35:34,573
Where will my son look for me?
Go on folks, I'll stay here

693
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:40,477
Come on, Shalu.
- I'm not going

694
01:35:40,602 --> 01:35:41,979
Come on.
- I won't!

695
01:35:42,203 --> 01:35:46,549
Why won't you?
- Let go of me! You cur!

696
01:35:50,478 --> 01:35:53,823
Don't set the houses ablaze!

697
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:33,329
Slut! Sit there! Trying to run away?
Where will you run to?

698
01:36:33,688 --> 01:36:37,636
I'm the chief now!
And you are marrying me!

699
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:42,531
I'll kill you if you force me!
Or I'll kill myself

700
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:47,202
I'm a gypsy! And a gypsy girl
never changes her man

701
01:36:47,535 --> 01:36:50,982
I'm Amar's. I'll belong only to him!
- Only if he's alive

702
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:54,014
He's alive. Basanti said that.
- Is that some life?

703
01:36:54,342 --> 01:37:00,725
Like hounds the king's men will
chase him. And he'll run scared

704
01:37:01,049 --> 01:37:05,964
You get that? Bibi Amma too says,
you will never marry Amar!

705
01:37:06,288 --> 01:37:10,896
Whether I marry him or not,
I have committed my life to him

706
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:14,239
Then get this! Stay right here.
You're being watched

707
01:37:14,562 --> 01:37:17,372
Step outside, and I'll break
your limbs. Get that?

708
01:37:29,577 --> 01:37:30,681
Ma...?

709
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:33,752
Nla!

710
01:37:34,582 --> 01:37:39,156
Ma, what has happened?
- We're ruined, son

711
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:42,693
We're ruined.
- What are you saying, Ma?

712
01:37:43,758 --> 01:37:49,265
I breathed only to see you.
I can die in peace now

713
01:37:49,597 --> 01:37:55,604
No Ma, don't say that...
- I'm losing time, Amar, my son

714
01:37:58,406 --> 01:38:02,877
Son, I must tell you a secret.
- What secret, Ma?

715
01:38:04,312 --> 01:38:10,729
I'm not your mother.
- Don't say that. You are my Ma

716
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:15,295
Son, in the temple
of Lord Ganesh...

717
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:19,628
in the forest... I found you in
the temple of Lord Ganesh

718
01:38:21,029 --> 01:38:24,033
Someone had left you there.
- Who left me there, Ma?

719
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:29,245
You come from a high stock, son.
- No Ma, I'm your son

720
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:34,450
No son... look at this

721
01:38:36,344 --> 01:38:40,850
This was tied to your arm

722
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:47,656
This will lead you to your parents

723
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:09,050
Bibi Amma...
- What is it?

724
01:39:09,377 --> 01:39:12,017
Make an amulet for me.
- Amulet? What kind, chief?

725
01:39:12,347 --> 01:39:15,021
I want to win Shallo's heart.
- Shallo's heart?

726
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:18,490
Yes.
- Abracadabra!

727
01:39:21,389 --> 01:39:25,201
Shallo...? She has flown, chief.
- What...?

728
01:39:53,721 --> 01:39:57,828
Where is Amar?
- I too came looking for Amar

729
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,906
But I ind no one here.
- I thought he must have come...

730
01:40:02,230 --> 01:40:07,543
so I returned. If Amar is not found,
the princess will die

731
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:10,746
What happened to the princess?
- As soon as the elephant...

732
01:40:11,072 --> 01:40:14,076
raised its leg to trample Amar,
Her Majesty fainted

733
01:40:14,943 --> 01:40:19,551
Perhaps, it still plays
deep inside her mind

734
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:23,152
It seems as if she'll die for Amar

735
01:40:23,918 --> 01:40:28,230
God forbid such love.
- Will you take me to the princess?

736
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:33,862
How can I take you inside the palace?
- I'll show you the way. Follow me

737
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:37,971
Allah is great

738
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:46,245
Basanti, where have you been? How
could you leave the princess behind?

739
01:40:46,574 --> 01:40:49,919
From a mendicant outside the city
I have brought some holy incense

740
01:40:50,278 --> 01:40:53,157
Who is that with you?
- She serves the mendicant

741
01:40:53,481 --> 01:40:57,588
She wants to see the princess once.
Her magic might just work

742
01:40:58,586 --> 01:41:03,035
May I be given permission.
Allah is great

743
01:41:05,794 --> 01:41:08,798
Take her inside, Basanti.
- Come

744
01:41:15,537 --> 01:41:16,811
Your Majesty...

745
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:24,089
Your Majesty, I'm Shallo

746
01:41:28,817 --> 01:41:31,821
I'm Shallo, Your Majesty.
Amar is alive

747
01:41:33,554 --> 01:41:36,831
Your Amar is alive, princess.
- Who are you talking to, Shallo?

748
01:41:38,193 --> 01:41:40,002
She has turned into stone

749
01:41:41,696 --> 01:41:47,510
I'm stone-hearted. I couldn't fathom
her pining, how deep is her love

750
01:41:48,903 --> 01:41:54,854
Today I know the difference
between selishness and sacriice

751
01:41:56,344 --> 01:42:01,521
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I wanted to snatch Amar away from you

752
01:42:03,318 --> 01:42:07,323
I wanted to defeat you.
But your love has defeated me

753
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:14,197
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
Amar is yours, he'll be only yours

754
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:16,870
Yes Your Majesty, Amar belongs to you

755
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:22,377
Your Majesty believe me, Amar belongs
to you. He'll only be yours

756
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:31,881
Amar must be brought here at any cost.
Only Amar can save her

757
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:36,694
Amar has to be brought here. Only he
can give her a new lease of life

758
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:40,890
Come on

759
01:42:46,627 --> 01:42:48,573
Allah is great

760
01:42:48,896 --> 01:42:53,504
Did you make something out?
- Yes, Your Highness

761
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:58,247
But alas, I can do nothing about it

762
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:03,282
Why not?
- She's possessed by a great spirit

763
01:43:03,611 --> 01:43:07,923
The spirit has entered right into
her soul. And to drive it out...

764
01:43:08,249 --> 01:43:12,527
alas, alas!
- Can someone exorcise?

765
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:17,534
Only one man can drive it out.
- Who?

766
01:43:17,992 --> 01:43:20,598
The great seer

767
01:43:21,929 --> 01:43:24,603
Then get him over.
- From where, Sire?

768
01:43:24,933 --> 01:43:30,611
It's been ages since I met him.
He's an ascetic, a nomad

769
01:43:30,939 --> 01:43:33,749
Spends his day here,
night there

770
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:39,288
Can there be a way out to ind him?
- There is one way out

771
01:43:39,647 --> 01:43:46,587
Set the drums beating. If he hears
that a devout woman...

772
01:43:46,954 --> 01:43:52,427
is badly in need of his help,
he'll come running here, Sire

773
01:43:53,094 --> 01:43:59,170
His sight will cure the patient.
Allah is great

774
01:44:06,974 --> 01:44:10,786
Very well. Let's try this too

775
01:44:14,782 --> 01:44:19,322
Attention.
Hear the royal proclamation

776
01:44:19,687 --> 01:44:27,663
Hear one and all.
Princess Padmavati is possessed

777
01:44:28,162 --> 01:44:33,407
If any common man, or an ascetic
can drive the spirit away...

778
01:44:33,735 --> 01:44:39,617
and cure the princess, he shall be
rewarded with 500 gold coins...

779
01:44:40,007 --> 01:44:42,180
and ive villages

780
01:44:54,822 --> 01:44:56,529
Raja...? You?

781
01:45:02,797 --> 01:45:06,267
Amar, you are alive!
- Shallo, someone will hear

782
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:11,447
Did you hear? The princess thinks
you are dead. She has lost her senses

783
01:45:11,839 --> 01:45:15,218
Not spirits, she's possessed
by your love

784
01:45:15,943 --> 01:45:19,049
There's only way she can be saved.
- How?

785
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:25,063
She must see you. All the seers
can't do what a lover's sight can

786
01:45:25,553 --> 01:45:30,662
Shallo, does that come from you?
- You were the one who said...

787
01:45:31,058 --> 01:45:34,301
those in love give their lives,
they don't take lives

788
01:45:34,595 --> 01:45:37,075
Come to your senses, my child

789
01:45:37,565 --> 01:45:42,071
Who are you reasoning with?
The poor thing isn't herself

790
01:45:44,939 --> 01:45:48,751
Padma, my child...
- Padma, where are you going?

791
01:45:57,084 --> 01:45:58,893
Open the door, Padma

792
01:45:59,086 --> 01:46:00,656
Open the door

793
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:03,090
Open the door, Your Majesty.

794
01:46:03,825 --> 01:46:05,600
Open up, Padma

795
01:46:08,096 --> 01:46:12,875
Allah! Succour of the miserable,
shows us Thy mercy

796
01:46:13,234 --> 01:46:15,271
Show us

797
01:46:16,303 --> 01:46:18,909
Who are you?
- Foolish king! Come to your senses

798
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:23,120
Fear Allah.
Address the elders respectfully

799
01:46:24,345 --> 01:46:28,384
I'm Ali the qalandar,
the merry dervish!

800
01:46:29,851 --> 01:46:36,700
Nlendicant, in the king's presence
be humble, not vain

801
01:46:37,125 --> 01:46:42,404
In humility I stand before Allah,
no human I fear

802
01:46:43,131 --> 01:46:50,140
Keep your Lordship to yourself.
I'm going away to the King of Kings

803
01:46:50,604 --> 01:46:52,311
Your Majesty!

804
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:56,144
What are you doing, Sire?
He is the great seer...

805
01:46:56,844 --> 01:47:01,156
who can do wonders.
He has the Midas touch!

806
01:47:01,883 --> 01:47:06,730
Mercy, O great seer. Forgive him,
he's ignorant. Mercy!

807
01:47:07,154 --> 01:47:09,634
Hey mere mortal,
I'm a spiritual soul

808
01:47:09,957 --> 01:47:14,497
I fear not Death. This world belongs
to none. You're born, so you shall die

809
01:47:14,862 --> 01:47:19,709
Only love will prevail.
Love is love

810
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:27,184
Whose love, seer?
- Of the one with lovely tresses

811
01:47:27,508 --> 01:47:31,854
Of the one inside.
Love inside everyone

812
01:47:32,179 --> 01:47:38,186
Goddess of love! My love,
I salute your beautiful tresses

813
01:47:51,532 --> 01:47:54,604
"My love, I salute you"

814
01:47:55,202 --> 01:47:57,546
"salutations to you"

815
01:47:57,905 --> 01:48:00,442
"My love, I salute you"

816
01:48:04,878 --> 01:48:09,349
"When in distress
I called out to you"

817
01:48:10,217 --> 01:48:12,959
"My love, I salute you"

818
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:18,159
"When you are near,
and when you are away..."

819
01:48:20,027 --> 01:48:22,029
"you still hold me in amazement"

820
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:28,043
"No matter if you are near or away,
my heart is where you stay"

821
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:31,248
"I salute you, my love"

822
01:49:14,515 --> 01:49:19,760
"You are my friend,
you are my Destiny"

823
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:25,564
"I have come to your doorstep,
love binds me"

824
01:49:26,294 --> 01:49:31,835
"I'm in love with you,
yet you are unawares"

825
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:37,215
"Unknown to you,
I love you"

826
01:49:43,811 --> 01:49:48,487
"Look at me and you'll feel
the agony inside me"

827
01:49:48,883 --> 01:49:51,329
"I salute you, my love"

828
01:50:22,917 --> 01:50:25,158
"I can wait no longer"

829
01:50:26,153 --> 01:50:28,155
"I'm lonely"

830
01:50:28,889 --> 01:50:31,529
"When will I see you?"

831
01:50:31,892 --> 01:50:34,634
"Oh, when will I rejoice?"

832
01:50:46,874 --> 01:50:51,516
"Sweetheart, break all the shackles
and come to me"

833
01:50:53,381 --> 01:50:58,729
"Let all the hurdles in our path
go up in smoke"

834
01:50:59,387 --> 01:51:04,393
"Let my lyric unveil the secrets"

835
01:51:04,725 --> 01:51:07,205
"I salute you, my love"

836
01:51:46,734 --> 01:51:49,408
"I behold only you.
- Wonderful"

837
01:51:49,737 --> 01:51:52,013
"You, my only desire"

838
01:51:52,807 --> 01:51:55,117
"Why are you indifferent?"

839
01:51:55,442 --> 01:51:57,718
"Are you dazed?"

840
01:51:58,545 --> 01:52:04,018
"Oh why am I in a daze?"

841
01:52:11,358 --> 01:52:13,599
"Recognise me"

842
01:52:14,261 --> 01:52:19,472
"Recognise my eyes,
the tears and the yearning"

843
01:52:26,407 --> 01:52:31,481
"What do I say how I feel?
The feeling in my heart is..."

844
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:37,156
"like lyric without music,
like a chalice without wine"

845
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:40,226
"My love, I salute you"

846
01:52:57,037 --> 01:52:59,176
Go outside, Your Highness.
- What for?

847
01:52:59,506 --> 01:53:04,182
The seer has taken in his own body
the spirit that possessed the princess

848
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:07,982
When he drives it away, it can attack
anyone. Stay outside, Your Highness

849
01:53:08,315 --> 01:53:10,818
Let's go, Sire.
- Quick

850
01:53:31,739 --> 01:53:36,210
Abracadabra! Calamity begone!

851
01:53:41,548 --> 01:53:43,550
Padma, I've returned
from the land of the dead

852
01:53:43,884 --> 01:53:48,094
You talk of the dead?
Oh, how many times have I died!

853
01:53:54,294 --> 01:53:57,070
They are thirsting for your blood.
Go away

854
01:53:57,464 --> 01:54:00,843
Go away? Alone? No Padma, no

855
01:54:02,336 --> 01:54:04,816
Deathly silence inside?
Not even a word?

856
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:13,353
Great seer, we can't hear the spirit.
Has it been exorcised?

857
01:54:15,282 --> 01:54:21,597
Patience. Patience, lady. I'm trying
to... the spirit is trying to escape

858
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:26,402
Thank You, Almighty!
Allah is great

859
01:54:27,628 --> 01:54:33,203
Let go! Let me go! I need
to talk to the king. it's urgent

860
01:54:34,301 --> 01:54:36,303
Your Majesty, you're being deceived

861
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:38,613
it's the ratbag!

862
01:54:38,973 --> 01:54:42,716
Allow him in.
- Stop her, she spells trouble

863
01:54:43,077 --> 01:54:45,284
Run! We've been exposed

864
01:54:45,612 --> 01:54:49,389
it's the gypsy inside. Amar.
He is disguised as the mendicant

865
01:54:58,525 --> 01:55:01,972
Don't brother, I beseech you.
Kill me if you want to

866
01:55:02,363 --> 01:55:06,311
You put on a farce to deceive me.
You ought to be ashamed. Step aside!

867
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:22,659
I don't miss my targets.
He must've died

868
01:55:23,083 --> 01:55:30,365
Until you cremate your enemy's corpse,
consider him alive, elders say

869
01:55:31,425 --> 01:55:35,965
Time demands that the princess
should be married off at the soonest

870
01:55:36,663 --> 01:55:40,338
Ask the priest to take
the proposal today itself

871
01:55:40,667 --> 01:55:43,671
So that when the need arrives,
we can take their help too

872
01:55:55,582 --> 01:55:59,086
Help! Please stop!

873
01:56:06,293 --> 01:56:10,105
What's wrong?
- Help us. My Amar is injured

874
01:56:10,597 --> 01:56:12,599
The king shot him

875
01:56:15,602 --> 01:56:20,176
Sher Khan, he's the valiant one
who saved my life. Pick him up

876
01:56:30,317 --> 01:56:32,160
Nothing serious, Queen Mother

877
01:56:38,392 --> 01:56:40,167
Look, Queen Mother

878
01:56:50,337 --> 01:56:56,049
Thank Allah for saving you.
- I must thank you for saving me

879
01:56:56,643 --> 01:57:00,648
May I ask you something, son?
Where did you End the armlet?

880
01:57:01,148 --> 01:57:04,061
My Ma gave it to me.
- Your mother?

881
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:07,228
Yes, I considered her my Ma

882
01:57:08,655 --> 01:57:12,660
Considered? You mean...?

883
01:57:13,393 --> 01:57:18,741
She wasn't my mother, but she
meant more than a mother to me

884
01:57:19,666 --> 01:57:23,409
She reared me, loved me deeply

885
01:57:27,407 --> 01:57:31,856
She also told me that someone had
left me at the temple of Lord Ganesh

886
01:57:32,679 --> 01:57:39,358
She had picked me up. That armlet
was tied to my arm at that time

887
01:57:40,454 --> 01:57:45,369
Right. She was right.
She wasn't your mother

888
01:57:45,792 --> 01:57:50,866
How do you know?
- Because I'm the unfortunate mother

889
01:57:51,965 --> 01:57:54,036
You...?
- Yes

890
01:57:55,702 --> 01:57:58,911
You abandoned me
in the temple? Why?

891
01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:04,906
When a mother abandons her baby,
not even God can fathom her grief

892
01:58:10,884 --> 01:58:15,162
it's a long tale, prince.
- What...? Prince?

893
01:58:16,723 --> 01:58:20,034
Yes son, you are a prince

894
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:22,135
I'm a prince...?

895
01:58:22,729 --> 01:58:25,039
What are you saying?

896
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:32,209
I lived just to have a glimpse of you

897
01:58:33,907 --> 01:58:36,751
For once, call me Ma

898
01:58:38,178 --> 01:58:40,089
Call me Ma, son. Just once

899
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:46,757
Ma

900
01:58:48,622 --> 01:58:50,101
Once again

901
01:58:51,958 --> 01:58:53,767
One more time

902
01:58:56,463 --> 01:59:00,343
Ma...
- My son, Amar

903
01:59:09,643 --> 01:59:13,523
Long live prince Amar Singh!

904
01:59:19,786 --> 01:59:23,461
Prince, my job is over

905
01:59:23,790 --> 01:59:27,465
To protect the truth, justice
and the subjects...

906
01:59:27,794 --> 01:59:30,968
today I hand over
the royal sword to you

907
01:59:38,405 --> 01:59:43,150
Prince Amar Singh, from this day
we consider you our king

908
01:59:47,814 --> 01:59:51,057
We, your subjects, anoint you
with our blood

909
01:59:53,553 --> 01:59:56,056
King Amar Singh...
- long may you reign

910
01:59:56,389 --> 01:59:58,630
Long live king Amar Singh

911
02:00:04,832 --> 02:00:10,180
Today you have anointed me
with blood in place of saffron...

912
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:15,519
and made me not a king, but you
have shackled me with love...

913
02:00:15,842 --> 02:00:23,056
and made me your slave. I promise,
for the blood I'm anointed with...

914
02:00:24,584 --> 02:00:30,057
I shall shed every drop of my blood
to repay it

915
02:00:31,124 --> 02:00:35,539
I declare rebellion!
Hail Goddess Bhavani!

916
02:00:35,862 --> 02:00:37,535
Hail Goddess Bhavani!

917
02:01:07,561 --> 02:01:10,565
Rebellion...?
- Rebellion!

918
02:01:10,897 --> 02:01:13,070
Rebellion!

919
02:01:16,703 --> 02:01:19,912
My respected Father's statue
was broken today

920
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:24,918
The flag of rebellion was hoisted not
at the village square but in my heart

921
02:01:25,912 --> 02:01:34,332
My commander, my general, governor,
vizier and my army...

922
02:01:35,622 --> 02:01:39,934
everyone blindly stood watching me
being humiliated

923
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:45,239
And also kept assuring me that
the Queen and the prince were dead

924
02:01:45,932 --> 02:01:51,678
And today the dead come alive?
How come? How?

925
02:01:52,039 --> 02:01:56,613
Sire, don't the dead stand in for
their progeny? Is he an impostor?

926
02:02:02,215 --> 02:02:10,191
Not Moon nor Sun makes a dawn. In any
other name, the enemy, is but an enemy

927
02:02:11,958 --> 02:02:18,102
Before this rebellion rises
like a storm, quell it

928
02:02:19,666 --> 02:02:25,514
Send the armies to every corner,
shoot every suspect

929
02:02:25,972 --> 02:02:31,183
Let the voice of rebellion
be buried in the twang of gunshots

930
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:36,456
Speak! Where is your Queen?
- I know nothing

931
02:02:36,783 --> 02:02:38,785
Where is the prince?
- I know nothing

932
02:02:39,085 --> 02:02:41,395
Speak!
- I know nothing

933
02:02:42,689 --> 02:02:47,069
Bloody rebel! Tell me the whereabouts
of the prince, or your head will roll

934
02:02:47,694 --> 02:02:51,801
I'm not a rebel. Believe me.
- You've gotten used to lying!

935
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,174
Where is the prince?
- I don't know

936
02:02:57,804 --> 02:03:02,685
All your men couldn't ind
the hiding place of the rebels

937
02:03:03,009 --> 02:03:05,819
How will I face the king?
- Can't help it, general

938
02:03:06,146 --> 02:03:10,686
The people are with them. Not even
flaying them has opened their mouths

939
02:03:14,021 --> 02:03:22,031
What your power couldn't do till now,
I must use my brains to do it

940
02:03:24,797 --> 02:03:28,609
Do what I have told you to do.
- Yes sir

941
02:03:29,803 --> 02:03:31,043
No blunders

942
02:03:32,739 --> 02:03:38,382
My message should be sent to
the Diwan of Rajgadh today itself

943
02:03:39,946 --> 02:03:42,449
We need his help.
- Right sir

944
02:03:42,849 --> 02:03:46,058
Long live the prince.
Long live the Queen

945
02:03:51,224 --> 02:03:52,726
Old man...
- Let go!

946
02:03:53,059 --> 02:03:55,733
Where have you hidden
the Queen and the prince?

947
02:03:56,062 --> 02:03:59,703
Else, your sons will be killed
right before you

948
02:04:00,066 --> 02:04:06,642
Destroy us. Kill us. We're rebels!
We won't tell you the whereabouts...

949
02:04:07,073 --> 02:04:11,249
of the Queen and the prince.
We won't tell you

950
02:04:11,578 --> 02:04:15,253
We won't tell you. Kill me,
but I won't tell you

951
02:04:18,085 --> 02:04:23,091
Speak. Else, I'll kill you.
- Go on, kill me

952
02:04:23,823 --> 02:04:28,431
But remember, the death of a rebel
breathes life into the cause

953
02:04:28,795 --> 02:04:33,744
Kill me. Long live the prince.
Long live the Queen

954
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:35,374
Then die!

955
02:04:45,712 --> 02:04:48,454
Bless you, warrior.
Great is your courage

956
02:04:48,982 --> 02:04:52,930
You are great, sir.
I salute your patriotism

957
02:05:01,027 --> 02:05:04,270
Does the princess know that
you are a prince in rebellion?

958
02:05:05,131 --> 02:05:06,633
I don't know

959
02:05:10,937 --> 02:05:13,816
You haven't informed her?
- No

960
02:05:20,146 --> 02:05:22,148
Have you forgotten her?

961
02:05:30,056 --> 02:05:35,472
She has loved you, and...
- Shallo, it's the time of war

962
02:05:36,162 --> 02:05:38,164
Not the time to chant love

963
02:05:44,871 --> 02:05:51,789
Amar, love is her life. How is she at
fault if you have turned a prince...

964
02:05:52,178 --> 02:05:56,957
from a gypsy? Has she wronged you?
- No

965
02:05:57,283 --> 02:06:02,995
Then why have you changed so?
- Shallo look there...

966
02:06:04,691 --> 02:06:10,004
look at the Queen Mother. An atrocious
brute murdered her husband...

967
02:06:11,131 --> 02:06:17,013
snatched away the throne from her
and made a beggar out of a Queen

968
02:06:18,204 --> 02:06:22,346
And for years, quelling the ire of
vengeance in her heart, she waited...

969
02:06:22,675 --> 02:06:26,680
for the day when her son would grow up
and avenge every atrocity...

970
02:06:27,013 --> 02:06:32,019
that was committed on her,
regain the lost throne...

971
02:06:32,352 --> 02:06:36,232
and turn her into a Queen again

972
02:06:37,123 --> 02:06:41,003
And now that her dream
is about to come true...

973
02:06:41,327 --> 02:06:46,333
should I tell her that I'm in love
with the enemy's daughter?

974
02:06:47,033 --> 02:06:49,639
That, at this crucial juncture,
I can't choose between love and war?

975
02:06:50,036 --> 02:06:52,482
Just imagine the predicament
she will be in

976
02:06:53,139 --> 02:06:58,452
And what about the expectations
my father's soul has of me?

977
02:07:00,012 --> 02:07:03,255
Think only about it, Shallo.
Forget everything else

978
02:07:07,854 --> 02:07:11,267
Your Majesty! Know who
the rebelling prince is?

979
02:07:11,591 --> 02:07:13,070
Who...?
- Your Amar

980
02:07:13,326 --> 02:07:15,966
Amar...?
- Yes, Shallo told me

981
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:24,706
They shot two of sons
right in front of me!

982
02:07:25,338 --> 02:07:30,788
Dragging us through the forest, they
were taking us to their commander...

983
02:07:31,277 --> 02:07:36,727
when your men reached there.
- Had we not reached in time, this...

984
02:07:37,050 --> 02:07:39,291
poor man's two other sons would've
been shot to death, Queen Mother

985
02:07:40,053 --> 02:07:45,059
But I'm not grieving, Queen Mother.
Even if a hundred sons of mine...

986
02:07:45,391 --> 02:07:50,704
were to sacriice for your sake,
I'd still consider myself blessed

987
02:07:51,097 --> 02:07:55,978
I'm proud of your patriotism.
Sher Khan, arrange for his treatment

988
02:07:56,302 --> 02:07:58,976
Hail the Queen Mother.
- What news?

989
02:07:59,305 --> 02:08:02,775
Rajgadh's army has marched off
to aid Vikram Singh

990
02:08:03,309 --> 02:08:05,311
Marched off...?
- When will the army reach here?

991
02:08:05,478 --> 02:08:08,982
By night tomorrow.
- Then we must attack the fort...

992
02:08:09,315 --> 02:08:12,319
before they arrive.
- So soon?

993
02:08:12,652 --> 02:08:17,658
Yes Shallo, at this juncture the
enemy is weak. Half its troops...

994
02:08:17,991 --> 02:08:22,997
are spread among the villages.
We must set forth tonight itself...

995
02:08:23,329 --> 02:08:28,335
so that before the enemy awakes,
our cannons would mark our arrival

996
02:08:28,668 --> 02:08:33,344
I agree with Amar Singh.
One who attacks irst wins the war

997
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:38,013
I've got to know, brother.
The throne you sit upon was snatched

998
02:08:38,344 --> 02:08:40,790
And now the rightful heir
has come forth

999
02:08:41,848 --> 02:08:47,628
Our Father had murdered. Humanity
demands that we wash away the taint

1000
02:08:48,021 --> 02:08:50,399
And hand over the kingdom
to the rightful heir

1001
02:08:50,723 --> 02:08:53,863
A kingdom is no plaything
that can be gifted lovingly

1002
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:59,036
Crowns are wrested, and might
is used to preserve them

1003
02:08:59,365 --> 02:09:03,780
And I shall do it till my last breath.
- The people can't take it lying down

1004
02:09:04,103 --> 02:09:07,482
They seek an answer. If they don't
ind an answer, they rebel

1005
02:09:07,807 --> 02:09:12,415
Men confront a rebellion. Women must
stay quiet and watch the fun

1006
02:09:12,745 --> 02:09:16,192
Women don't only watch the fun.
If the need be, they wield swords too

1007
02:09:16,516 --> 02:09:21,056
Turn the pages of history, brother.
- Brave men don't read history

1008
02:09:21,387 --> 02:09:23,526
They write new history
by the edge of the sword

1009
02:09:33,399 --> 02:09:37,074
May Goddess Bhavani protect you,
my son. Return victorious

1010
02:09:40,406 --> 02:09:44,081
Allah willing, Queen Mother, we shall
annihilate the enemy and return...

1011
02:09:44,411 --> 02:09:47,415
with the royal carriage tomorrow,
and take you to the palace...

1012
02:09:47,747 --> 02:09:50,125
with great pomp and splendour. Amen

1013
02:09:56,455 --> 02:09:59,197
Hail Goddess Bhavani!
- Hail Goddess Bhavani!

1014
02:10:18,444 --> 02:10:22,586
They have left, general.
- Yes. Are the horses ready?

1015
02:10:22,949 --> 02:10:25,190
Yes sir. Behind the hill

1016
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:27,123
Deathly silence. The enemy
is sleeping unawares

1017
02:11:27,513 --> 02:11:30,517
Behind the gate,
the throne awaits you

1018
02:11:31,017 --> 02:11:33,520
Uncle Khan, get the cannons
at the front

1019
02:11:35,688 --> 02:11:41,138
I shall lead the charge. Uncle Khan,
you will attack from the right

1020
02:11:41,527 --> 02:11:44,770
And you will stay here with your
forces and attack the fleeing enemies

1021
02:11:45,097 --> 02:11:47,543
Right.
- Shallo, if something untoward...

1022
02:11:47,867 --> 02:11:51,337
happens to me in this battle...
I leave my Mother in your hands

1023
02:11:51,671 --> 02:11:53,878
Take care of her as a son would

1024
02:12:01,247 --> 02:12:02,487
Nawaz Khan...
- Yes sir?

1025
02:12:02,815 --> 02:12:05,352
As soon as we charge,
blow up the gates

1026
02:12:13,559 --> 02:12:15,766
Hail Goddess Bhavani!
- Hail Goddess Bhavani!

1027
02:12:57,236 --> 02:12:59,614
Did you think I was
having a good sleep?

1028
02:13:00,606 --> 02:13:06,784
Uneasy rests the head
that wears the Crown

1029
02:13:08,414 --> 02:13:13,295
Fool! You think you can incite these
handful of peasants, give them toys...

1030
02:13:13,619 --> 02:13:19,626
and get them to face cannons?
- Not cannons, resolves win battles

1031
02:13:20,059 --> 02:13:24,633
And resolves of my men run higher
than the walls you defend

1032
02:13:24,997 --> 02:13:28,535
Even ants aim higher,
but they can't harm mountain

1033
02:13:29,635 --> 02:13:35,984
If I wish, I can slaughter you
and your men right now

1034
02:13:36,642 --> 02:13:41,057
But I don't want to punish
those poor men for your trespasses

1035
02:13:41,747 --> 02:13:47,254
So I give you one chance. Surrender,
and I shall spare their lives

1036
02:13:47,653 --> 02:13:54,662
We are prepared to die, Vikram Singh.
My soldiers aren't mercenaries...

1037
02:13:55,094 --> 02:13:59,474
the men whom your tyranny
has turned into rebels

1038
02:14:02,535 --> 02:14:08,349
Your father assassinated the king
and usurped the throne

1039
02:14:08,674 --> 02:14:12,952
And we're sworn to wrest it back

1040
02:14:18,484 --> 02:14:19,485
Halt!

1041
02:14:20,953 --> 02:14:22,955
Won't you pay obeisances
to the Queen Mother?

1042
02:14:25,391 --> 02:14:30,363
She is perched on the throne
that is truly hers

1043
02:14:33,866 --> 02:14:35,038
Look

1044
02:14:42,508 --> 02:14:47,890
Step forward, and your mother
will be blown to pieces

1045
02:14:55,521 --> 02:15:00,732
I give you my word. If you surrender,
I shall forgive your men

1046
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:07,406
What keeps you, Amar?
This is no time to ponder

1047
02:15:07,733 --> 02:15:13,308
Step forward and snatch the right
that your father was deprived of

1048
02:15:13,739 --> 02:15:16,049
Right now it is your only duty

1049
02:15:18,744 --> 02:15:20,746
Don't waste my time, gypsy

1050
02:15:22,748 --> 02:15:26,753
If you don't surrender your arms,
at the fourth stroke of the drum...

1051
02:15:27,086 --> 02:15:31,933
the cannon will be ired.
Light the match

1052
02:15:58,784 --> 02:16:00,127
Wait!

1053
02:16:01,687 --> 02:16:07,467
I accept your every condition if you
will release the Queen Mother...

1054
02:16:07,793 --> 02:16:13,402
in exchange for me.
- No Amar! Don't think about me

1055
02:16:13,799 --> 02:16:18,805
Do your duty as a warrior.
This kingdom is yours. Seize it

1056
02:16:19,605 --> 02:16:27,387
No Ma, not for all the riches
in the world will I give up my Mother

1057
02:16:28,014 --> 02:16:31,484
Amar, don't forsake your duty
just for the sake of one relationship

1058
02:16:31,817 --> 02:16:36,493
Unto duty you are beholden.
Duty is God

1059
02:16:36,956 --> 02:16:41,837
If duty is God,
I hold my Mother dear

1060
02:16:42,962 --> 02:16:46,341
Vikram Singh, untie her

1061
02:16:47,833 --> 02:16:49,835
I surrender

1062
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:55,841
Done

1063
02:17:27,973 --> 02:17:35,892
I kept my word, Vikram Singh. Fulill
your promise. Release my Mother

1064
02:17:36,882 --> 02:17:41,558
Fool, you can only lead the stupid
gypsies. How would you understand...

1065
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:46,894
the intricacies of politics? In
politics, promises are never fulilled

1066
02:17:50,663 --> 02:17:55,476
Vikram Singh, you are one step ahead
of your father in treachery

1067
02:17:56,602 --> 02:17:59,913
I don't regard my vanquished enemy's
words as abuse

1068
02:18:00,906 --> 02:18:07,152
All I want to know is if the son
will see his mother die irst?

1069
02:18:07,613 --> 02:18:10,059
Or the mother will her son die irst?

1070
02:18:14,253 --> 02:18:17,427
Decide fast.
Death is catching up on you

1071
02:18:18,057 --> 02:18:24,406
In the face of courage, at times
even Death steps aside, Vikram Singh

1072
02:18:31,937 --> 02:18:34,747
Amar has been deceived!
- Blow up the gate!

1073
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:56,637
Fire the cannon

1074
02:18:57,496 --> 02:18:59,134
Cannoneer, ire

1075
02:19:49,014 --> 02:19:50,550
Save the Queen Mother, quick

1076
02:19:59,792 --> 02:20:02,170
Let me see who saves you
from the cannon

1077
02:20:04,029 --> 02:20:07,533
Princess, you're helping the enemy?
- I'm in the side of justice

1078
02:20:07,933 --> 02:20:10,140
Arrest her!
- Who dares?

1079
02:20:49,074 --> 02:20:52,749
Bloody old fraud!
I'll see the end of you!

1080
02:22:46,658 --> 02:22:48,001
No!

1081
02:23:14,352 --> 02:23:16,559
Oh, what have you done?

1082
02:23:18,657 --> 02:23:22,935
I have given to you what is yours,
Your Majesty

1083
02:23:25,230 --> 02:23:29,406
His Highness Amar Singh...
- long may he reign

1084
02:23:36,241 --> 02:23:42,248
This victory is not mine,
I owe it to all my subjects

1085
02:23:42,981 --> 02:23:46,861
No Your Highness, justice wins!
- Truth wins

1086
02:23:47,252 --> 02:23:48,925
Victory of humanity!

1087
02:23:49,254 --> 02:23:50,927
May the truth prevail!

1088
02:23:51,256 --> 02:23:52,929
Let humanity prevail!

1089
02:23:53,258 --> 02:23:55,260
May justice triumph!
