1
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,176
You say your piece

2
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,679
I speak my mind

3
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:19,107
''You say a few words
to which I add my bit''

4
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,108
- Good day to you.
- Good day.

5
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:22,114
- HeIIo sir.
- HeIIo.

6
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,117
Master, shaII we Ieave?''

7
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,664
It's raining cats and dogs...

8
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,163
that is why I suggested it.

9
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:43,566
This dam is a hundred years oId.

10
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,895
- Of the EngIish times.
- That is why it's stiII standing.

11
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,504
But it won't Iast much Ionger.

12
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,109
Last year too it bareIy managed
to hoId the water pressure.

13
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,112
This year we'II have a good monsoon.

14
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,444
I mean to say this year
the dam must be repaired.

15
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,775
In order to repair it
we must Iet out the water.

16
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,781
We can make a hoIe in the
north and drain the water.

17
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,093
No! Our fieIds Iie that way.
This wiII ruin our crops.

18
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,629
''If the dam breaks,
the viIIage wiII be destroyed.''

19
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,166
Vishnu Pratap's fieIds
too are on that side.

20
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,592
Don't worry about my fieIds.
The viIIage shouId be safe.

21
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,898
What do you say, Virendra Pratap?''

22
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,099
- I don't accept it.
- TeII him I'II reimburse his Ioss

23
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,843
Do you think we're beggars?

24
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,513
Giving us aIms!

25
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,115
''Rudra Pratap, he means
the viIIage weIfare...''

26
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,882
Don't keep harping on that.

27
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,490
Where were the viIIagers
when I was iII treated?

28
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,092
When our home caught fire

29
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,699
Nobody came to douse the fire.

30
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,592
You are an engineer. Find
another way to save the dam.

31
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,107
My fieIds shouId not be touched.

32
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,771
''UncIe, Iet's Ieave. AII of
you go or I'II sIaughter you!''

33
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,116
Each is the opposite of the other.

34
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,778
Neither wiII they co-operate
nor wiII the viIIage benefit.

35
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,119
- You are right.
- Let's go.

36
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:46,055
Go and ask if he needs something.

37
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,061
''Left to himseIf, your master
won't ever ask for water.''

38
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,430
''- Go...
- If I ask, as usuaI he'II refuse.''

39
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,834
Sir, do you want water?''

40
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,765
Has your mistress
taken her medication?

41
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,440
Knew it. Mistress wiII ask about
your food and you about her piIIs.

42
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,109
Nobody inquires about me.

43
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,114
ShaII I get you hot miIk?

44
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,118
No. Do me a favour.
Get Rohit.

45
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,821
Saturn is in a voIatiIe mood.

46
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:24,927
- Where...?
- And Jupiter is in the Iower house.

47
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,092
How can there be peace of mind?

48
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,097
That is why we caIIed you over.

49
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,603
You give us the soIution.

50
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,107
I offered the soIution 5 years ago.

51
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,111
But sir aIways rejects it.

52
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,111
You must take my advice.

53
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,449
CeIebrate your 60th birthday.

54
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:50,044
Invite the reIatives and
appease the 9 pIanets.

55
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:57,093
The activity in the house wiII
make your sickIy wife feeI better.

56
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,826
That is right.

57
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,830
Accept this suggestion at Ieast
for the sake of the mistress' heaIth.

58
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,051
Very weII.

59
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,823
Invite everyone.

60
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:41,596
Keep this bottIe. And biscuits.
CaII me the moment you reach.

61
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:45,038
Everyone wouId have come except
for you. What wiII they say?

62
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,042
That you're not bothered.

63
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,547
I'm not his bIood reIative.

64
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:52,846
Why do you say that?
Nobody wiII think anything.

65
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:55,053
Everyone knows I'm here
for father's work.

66
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,783
Anyway don't worry.
I'II get there soon.

67
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,058
- Okay.
- MangaIa and you wiII be there.

68
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,561
The guard has signaIIed
for the train to Ieave.

69
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,098
- Keep the ticket.
- Yes.

70
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,099
Where is MangaIa?

71
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,641
- Where were you?
- The piIIs before breakfast.

72
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,551
And the capsuIes after meaIs.
Is that understood?

73
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,049
I'II do that.
Now make a move.

74
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,718
- How can the train Ieave
without me? - Go on!

75
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,717
What is the matter?

76
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,546
Why is the sugar cane not ripe?

77
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,709
Must be good enough for you to eat.

78
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,553
''- You're right here?
- Yes, I'm here.''

79
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,056
- Get the cane before Naina comes.
- I knew it.

80
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,889
I got the sugar cane from the fieId.

81
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,098
Grandpa! Take off your watch.

82
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,027
Remove your watch.

83
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:20,027
- Here...
- I got you a new watch.

84
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,042
- Wow...
- Like it?

85
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,542
Very nice but why did you
have to spend so much money?

86
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,844
Not my money. Daddy paid the biII.

87
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:37,044
''Miss Doctor, have you
compIeted the medicaI course?''

88
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:43,061
Chotu went from CIass 1
to 2 to 3 and now to 4!

89
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,031
But MangaIa hasn't
compIeted her studies.

90
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,866
It takes 5 years to
compIete medicaI studies.

91
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:56,705
''Don't bIuff me. If one studies
hard, a year or two is enough.''

92
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,636
This is the resuIt of pampering her.

93
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:05,041
''Grandpa, actuaIIy
Govind is right.''

94
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,782
- What?
- You have spoiIt me.

95
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,056
- How come?
- By aIways giving in to me.

96
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,059
Now what do you want me to do?

97
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,689
''I have an idea!
Hey, Iisten everybody''

98
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,090
Lets get grandpa and grandma
married on his 60th birthday.

99
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,096
- Terrific!
- Did you hear that?

100
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,441
Let's print cards and invite everyone.

101
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,111
We'II have great fun.
Have a band and fireworks!

102
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,545
That's wonderfuI!

103
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:40,107
''Sing songs for them,
my grandma... the bride...''

104
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,765
Shut up!

105
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,832
- What is it?
- For the dogs...

106
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:03,099
Grass...? WiII my tigers eat grass?

107
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,542
Get mutton.

108
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,115
Father... breakfast.

109
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,058
Feed the dogs and shut them up.

110
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,594
Why are you making a noise?

111
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,088
So that we don't hear
the noise they are making.

112
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,769
That's the music of
happiness not noise.

113
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,106
The master and mistress of that
house are getting married again!

114
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,103
The oId coupIe are
aImost in their graves.

115
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,110
And want to get married!

116
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,951
They wiII die the moment
they compIete the ceremonies.

117
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,127
''Mother, I'II keep the
ornaments in the box.''

118
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,450
Mother, missing brother Inder?''

119
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,714
It's been 25 years.

120
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,126
Do you stiII miss him?

121
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,594
Yes, my dear.''

122
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:36,157
Humans Ieave but their
memories stay back.

123
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,835
Just as this chain is Iocked
in this box for 25 years...

124
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:47,576
SimiIarIy his memories
are Iocked in my heart.

125
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,117
I wish I couId see
Inder's famiIy once.

126
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,620
Just once...

127
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:08,155
Your adamant nature has
made the mistress so unhappy!

128
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,669
25 years have passed
since that incident.

129
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,569
Spit out that anger now.

130
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:20,111
The mistress wants to
see Inder's famiIy once.

131
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:35,126
The man who crushed the peace
and honour of this famiIy...

132
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,154
Why does the mistress
Iove him so much?

133
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,962
The poor souI is no more.

134
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,567
Don't abuse him.

135
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,771
''When he is no more,
whom do you want to see?''

136
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,099
Our son is no more but
aren't his kids our kids?

137
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,106
They weren't so far.
What's speciaI overnight?

138
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,117
So far there was
just a hope to Iive.

139
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,116
But now I feeI I might
die without seeing them.

140
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,124
Mother... Iisten...

141
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,121
Govind, go...''

142
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,625
CabIe them in Bombay.

143
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,096
ChiIdhood Iies behind us.

144
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,835
Youth stands before us.

145
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,842
Today we wiII be separated.

146
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,445
And nobody knows where
we wiII be tomorrow.

147
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,614
I'm crazy

148
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,117
I wiII steaI aII your hearts

149
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:44,052
I am crazy

150
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,716
I wiII steaI everyone's heart

151
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,559
Who knows...

152
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,098
Who has any inkIing...

153
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,433
Who knows or has any idea...

154
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,107
Where and on what path...

155
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:09,603
''I am crazy enough
to steaI your hearts''

156
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,420
I miss the days of spring

157
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,757
And the coIIege festivaI, MaIhar''

158
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,759
We'II miss the fight in the canteen

159
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,697
And making out in the Iibrary

160
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,094
BeautifuI and young...

161
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,109
Breath-taking girIs

162
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,840
They Ioved me

163
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,709
AII the good Iooking girIs

164
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,048
Behind the hosteI window

165
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,024
I'II miss waiting for you

166
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,559
The styIe...

167
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,529
The eIegance...

168
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,091
The styIe of eIegance...

169
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,107
The bIush and the fIush...

170
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,804
I am crazy

171
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,549
I wiII steaI aII your hearts

172
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,094
Stars gIittering in the eyes

173
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,529
''The Iight guides us
to our destination''

174
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,534
GraduaIIy raising hopes

175
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:22,046
Making one forget the way

176
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:26,050
Some are boId

177
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,849
Some worry

178
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:37,062
''Nobody knows what the
future hoIds in store''

179
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,497
Some might earn name

180
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,433
Somebody might become a star

181
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,504
Now begins...

182
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,643
''Now we embark on
the journey of Iife''

183
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,703
May you be happy.

184
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,876
Where are you going?

185
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,810
Don't teII him.
Guess...

186
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,713
- Varanasi?
- No.

187
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,885
- Vaishnodevi?
- AbsoIuteIy wrong.

188
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,890
We have no reIatives
who might invite us home.

189
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:45,791
Ask mother about that.

190
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,827
I'm asking her but
you keep butting in.

191
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:49,829
Mother, where are you going?''

192
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,037
Not me aIone. AII of us.

193
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,032
- But where?
- To your grandpa's!

194
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,702
Grandpa's...?

195
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:02,376
''After so many years,
he has sent a Ietter.''

196
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:04,480
He's caIIed us to the viIIage.

197
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,552
- But... when?
- By the evening train.

198
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,057
Brother!

199
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,904
We've come from Bombay.

200
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,112
WeIcome...

201
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,775
The Iuggage wiII come in
First you come in.

202
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,619
Come in.

203
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:47,057
Mistress... get up.

204
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,727
Take a Iook at who is here.
It's the Bombay guests.

205
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,055
Deepa, isn't it?''

206
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,652
In what cIass are you?

207
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,091
In the eighth.

208
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,498
May you Iive Iong.

209
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,696
And you, Abhay?''

210
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,102
I've compIeted Iaw.

211
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,704
''- You mean engineer?
- No, Iawyer''

212
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,546
I knew it.

213
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:51,113
My Inder wasn't fated to see
the joys of his kids' success.

214
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:59,995
What are you doing? You insisted
of getting them here and now you cry.

215
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,633
Didn't the doctor say
you must remain happy.

216
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:05,669
Didn't he say so?

217
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,765
- Show them to their room.
- FoIIow me.

218
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,176
- Come... - Go...
- Good night.

219
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,581
Daughter-in-Iaw...

220
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,121
This is your house.

221
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,630
Be happy.

222
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,167
I wish we'd met when Inder was aIive

223
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,170
I'd have given you
some other bIessing.

224
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,107
But it was God's wiII.

225
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,108
The journey must have tired you.

226
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:54,118
''Such a Iong journey.
No probIem, you can rest.''

227
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,916
I'II serve you a good breakfast.

228
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,622
Such a breakfast that...

229
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,122
Your grandfather just woke up.

230
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,624
That is why he...

231
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,427
He wiII be fine in the morning.

232
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,103
PIease rest.

233
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,834
We won't stay here.

234
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,574
We'II go back in the morning.

235
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,703
''Mother, what is the point in
inviting and then humiIiating us?''

236
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,114
He hasn't caIIed us out of Iove.

237
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,616
He caIIed us for the sake
of his aiIing wife.

238
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,119
His aiIing wife is your grandma!

239
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,850
And he is your grandfather.

240
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,621
Your father's parents.

241
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,623
We're not Iacking anything.

242
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:15,086
We have a huge void.

243
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:18,061
We have no eIders.

244
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,495
Mother...

245
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,101
''As Iong as your father
Iived, he tried...''

246
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,902
Somehow your grandpa's
anger be assuaged.

247
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:32,507
He wanted you to be cIose.

248
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:37,103
''But... son, now this
is your responsibiIity.''

249
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,111
Somehow you must fuIfiII
your Daddy's desire.

250
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,820
Respecting eIders does
not make one smaII.

251
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:54,087
The anger of the eIders
is onIy at the surface

252
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:58,093
There's a Iot of Iove underneath.

253
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:03,103
Yes. I feIt goose bumps
when grandma heId my hand.

254
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,906
And your eyes too were spiIIing.

255
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,910
No such thing happened to me.
Don't make up stories.

256
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,496
What a machine.

257
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,864
No brush or bIade or soap or water...

258
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:38,599
TeII your grandson to give me
the machine when heroes back.

259
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,113
I'II use that machine to shave you.

260
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:48,542
- Where are you? Focus on the job.
- Excuse me...

261
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,687
Who is this pest?

262
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,101
I am dead!!

263
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,447
Saved. It was a
tabIe not a waII cIock.

264
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,382
Looks Iike she hasn't
had a bath for 5 days.

265
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,050
She's taking so Iong!

266
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,521
Good morning, kids.''

267
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,088
- What...?
- Get in Iine.

268
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,424
Line...?

269
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,099
''- Isn't there another bathroom?
- Sure, inside the house.''

270
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,931
That's onIy for Iadies.

271
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,902
But you are kids.

272
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:46,838
- You can bathe outside.
- A Iady might watch!

273
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,042
These kids are reaI smart.

274
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,550
What are you doing?

275
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:59,045
This is terribIe. The person
inside wiII take at Ieast 5 minutes

276
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,491
That means 20 minutes.

277
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,091
Life sucks.

278
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,099
Let's pIay tiII the person gets out.

279
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,499
The train.

280
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,039
The train moves...

281
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,043
The station in between
asks it to haIt.

282
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,049
- HaIt.
- What happened?

283
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,718
We're at the station.
Game's up.

284
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,054
FouI! I was right at front.

285
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,059
Okay, you win. I give up.''

286
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,091
What's that there?

287
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,088
- That's a bathroom.
- Why didn't you say so?

288
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,029
It doesn't have a Iatch.

289
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,027
I'II sing my way through.

290
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,041
What were you doing for 90 minutes?

291
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,039
I didn't take that Iong.

292
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:02,552
I'II show you when you get out!

293
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,385
Who is singing in breathIess styIe?

294
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,087
The guy from Bombay.

295
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,799
''- Sundari, don't go...
- Why are you yeIIing?''

296
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,437
He'II be screaming.

297
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,761
What's wrong?

298
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,037
Saw the Bombay boy's face?

299
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:55,031
Everything but his face.

300
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,042
His face was covered with soap.

301
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,444
He's coming out.

302
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,063
''Hi, eIder aunt.
Grinding IentiIs?''

303
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,430
I'm the younger one.

304
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,865
I'm confused because
we're meeting for the first time.

305
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,109
- Don't dirty your fingers.
- No probIem.

306
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,113
We're famiIy. Anyway
I enjoy doing this.

307
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,116
Do you know I actuaIIy
wanted to run a hoteI?

308
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,117
AccidentaIIy I became a Iawyer.

309
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:22,423
''TeII me, why do you grind on
this stone when you have a mixer''

310
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:27,494
Because your grandfather Iikes
fried puffs ground on this.

311
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:40,508
Hurt your finger?

312
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,917
I got a smaII bruise
and you got worried.

313
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:53,555
''When there is Iove in your heart,
why didn't you taIk to me Iast night?''

314
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:59,493
Nobody was taIking to you
so I aIso kept siIent.

315
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,159
Finished grinding?

316
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:02,996
I'm getting it.

317
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:05,161
Give it to me. I'II take it in.

318
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,175
This IoveIy aroma can't
be of the fried puffs.

319
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,506
I'm sure it's the
smeII of your fingers.

320
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,513
ShaII I keep it here?

321
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:25,780
She has IoveIy hair.

322
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,954
Is your husband oId fashioned?

323
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:31,627
No.

324
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:34,164
You've tied one braid.

325
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:37,827
Two pIaits wouId suit your face cut.

326
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:43,496
''Yes, I'II Iook funny
with 2 pIaits at my age!''

327
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,604
Age has nothing to do with braids.

328
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,772
You have such great hair.
PIease turn around.

329
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,115
- I'II braid it for you.
- You...?

330
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,119
- You'II braid it?
- Sure. Turn around.

331
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,122
ActuaIIy I wanted to
become a hair styIist.

332
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,124
AccidentaIIy I became a Iawyer.

333
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:05,824
You have IoveIy hair.
But you must use shikakai.

334
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,827
They wiII turn siIky
I'II get it for you.

335
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,105
Now your husband wiII be speII bound.

336
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,507
May I have a dance?

337
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,548
Keep this hair styIe.

338
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,449
So this is how you fry puffs?

339
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,123
Good grief! I forgot because
Abhay was braiding my hair.

340
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,593
You're a IittIe girI to have 2 pIaits

341
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,925
That's what Abhay said.

342
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,825
Is this any age to
wear hair Iike this?

343
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,601
She didn't pay heed.
Said she had siIky hair...

344
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:50,107
''- Did I say that?
- No, I did.''

345
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,609
Let's not fight over it.

346
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,113
Get the puffs. The kids are hungry.

347
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:04,578
''HonestIy, eIder peopIe feeI
envious of younger ones Iook younger''

348
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:08,124
You Iook Iike Aishwarya Rai.

349
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,888
Now I won't get conned by you!

350
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,629
I know you are inteIIigent.

351
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:15,091
That is why we'II get aIong.

352
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,100
What's up?

353
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,766
I was pIucking fIowers for prayers.

354
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,110
- Who is that?
- Praying to God.

355
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:30,114
''Back home in my Bombay,
the vendor gets it home.''

356
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,582
Your Bombay?

357
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:34,948
For how much did you buy it?

358
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:40,113
- I didn't mean that.
- Don't act smart here.

359
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,126
I am the boss here.

360
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,757
''Without my permission,
nobody can touch a Ieaf.''

361
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,599
Get it?

362
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,096
And where is your
brother hiding his face?

363
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,769
He's not to be seen.

364
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,608
Turn around. He'II
be in front of your nose.

365
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,116
Got stuck?

366
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,091
I have an arresting face.

367
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:17,086
Like a heap of cow dung!

368
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,903
She's so vain!

369
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,609
As if it's her Pop's house.

370
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,112
Not hers. It's our Pop's house.

371
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,512
What does she think of herseIf?

372
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:41,114
- Who is she?
- The daughter of Dad's friend.

373
00:33:41,752 --> 00:33:44,721
She's been coming here for
years so grandpa Ioves her.

374
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:47,056
Watch how I set her straight.

375
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,598
Beware. None of you wiII go to him.

376
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:56,895
Our party wiII be separate.

377
00:33:57,134 --> 00:34:02,094
You don't have to say it.
We'II Iive and die with you.

378
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,539
After aII you are our captain.

379
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:08,111
You guys do the fieIding
and you bowI to me.

380
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:11,842
You do the fieIding. I'II bowI.

381
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,550
''- PIaying fiddIe sticks?
- No, cricket.''

382
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,788
Don't you know the difference?

383
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,056
''Without an umpire, it
can onIy be fiddIe sticks.''

384
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,060
''As far as cricket goes, it's
an internationaI game with ruIes.''

385
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,089
You know a Iot about cricket?

386
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,092
I wanted to become a cricketer
accidentaIIy I became a Iawyer.

387
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,836
Do you have cabIe TV?

388
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,106
Our match was teIecast Iive.
Sachin was with us.

389
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,609
You must have hit fours.

390
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,611
A few sixers too.

391
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,378
FooI your Bombay townsfoIk.
It won't do here.

392
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,048
AII right.

393
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,054
BowI to her. Let's see
how many sixers she hits.

394
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,058
Let's see how she pIays.

395
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,429
Give me one!

396
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:41,099
- Have you no shame bribing?
- It's chocoIate not bribe.

397
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,766
Give me more!

398
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,545
Now wiII you Iet me pIay?

399
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:56,383
''Just pIay? Keep giving us
chocoIates, we'II make you Captain.''

400
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,056
You just made me Captain.

401
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:02,057
Now we'II make you umpire.

402
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,062
WouId you seII your
souI for chocoIates?

403
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,088
I won't pIay with you!

404
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,101
Then go away.

405
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,097
She's Ieaving in a huff.
What is her name?

406
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:17,506
Sounds Iike a jungIe

407
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,805
CaII her once, WiId MangaIa.''

408
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,054
Work fast.

409
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,057
Brings a whoIe tin to
borrow a spoonfuI of sugar!

410
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,560
May I borrow some sugar?

411
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,063
A IittIe? Take it.

412
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,033
- Take the tin fuII Iike usuaI.
- Sure.

413
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:50,507
Grandma, what a name you've given me!''

414
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,443
- What's wrong?
- Nobody has oId fashioned names.

415
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:01,711
It's my name. Your parents
Iove me so they gave you my name.

416
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,054
Does this sound nice?

417
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,792
It neither sounds good
nor it is easy to say.

418
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:15,025
My parents had no sense
but what about your parents?

419
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,830
Don't speak about your
parents so derogatoriIy.

420
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,038
And don't say a word
about my Iate parents.

421
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:25,631
That Abhay has got everyone
on his side and teases me!

422
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,841
WiId MangaIa!

423
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,776
The teasing has started?

424
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,051
This Iater turns to Iove.

425
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,712
That's what happens in fiIms.

426
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:42,049
''You keep saying, this girI
brightens up the house.''

427
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,993
You won't want to send
her away from here.

428
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,532
I suggest you get her
married to your grandson.

429
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,829
The girI wiII stay at home.

430
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,036
He resembIes cow dung!

431
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,698
Why don't you marry him?

432
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:01,773
I'd Iove to but my husband is crueI.

433
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,637
He'II kiII me.

434
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,712
I'm the one who hit the shot.

435
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,646
- What a shot.
- The baII went there.

436
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,557
How wiII we pIay?

437
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,491
Who wiII get it?

438
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,758
I'II get it.

439
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,111
Our baII came here.

440
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,780
I'm Vishnu Pratap's grandson.

441
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,445
I've come from Bombay.

442
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,052
Are you Inder's son?

443
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,821
Yes.

444
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,603
I came in without permission.

445
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:04,107
You probabIy don't approve.

446
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,448
No!

447
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,646
Leave my arm!

448
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,089
Keep a cooI head.

449
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:25,092
No need to get furious.

450
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:34,093
The ceremony wiII be at the tempIe
across the river on Ram Navami.

451
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:41,442
I suggest you go there with the
famiIy and offer cIoth to the priest.

452
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,115
''On your return, ceIebrate
your 60th birthday.''

453
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:51,714
The fifth day after that
is very auspicious.

454
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,124
You can perform the
wedding ceremony then.

455
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,117
- After 12 days?
- Yes.

456
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,164
''Son, do you have a
probIem after 12 days?''

457
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:07,159
''No, father but I might have
to go to the city for some work.''

458
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,003
Doesn't matter.
You fix up everything.

459
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,772
Right, I'II do that.''

460
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:19,843
- Give the priest Rs. 101.
- Yes father.

461
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:23,619
I onIy have 500 notes.

462
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,123
I too don't have change.

463
00:40:27,524 --> 00:40:29,116
I have it. Here...

464
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,629
Give the priest Rs. 501

465
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,110
Grandma is getting married!

466
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,909
Grandma, your wedding date is fixed!''

467
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:55,444
You're getting married now?
My mother married Iong ago.

468
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,451
My mother got married
before I was born.

469
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,126
This is grandpa's wedding
because he's compIeted 60.

470
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,927
His 60th.

471
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:08,494
Where are the remaining 59 grandmas?

472
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:12,566
What's going on?

473
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:15,694
These days everyone
thinks he's a doctor

474
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,109
I asked him to rub some baIm.
My foot is aching.

475
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,113
This ache is due to age.

476
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,515
The other Ieg too is as oId
Why isn't that aching?

477
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,127
I just said wiId not miserIy.

478
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,605
Why do you keep
troubIing the poor girI?

479
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,940
- Who? - MangaIa.
- She's no poor girI.

480
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,702
She's frightfuI

481
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,116
- I'II apoIogise if you want me to
- Forget it.

482
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,119
- Get it over with...
- Listen...

483
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:45,053
ScoundreI! I'II kiII you!

484
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,558
Leave him!

485
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,061
Leave him aIone.

486
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,099
His staff feII off.
He apoIogised to you.

487
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,764
Yet you kept hitting him.

488
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,501
- What is wrong with you?
- Leave me!

489
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,606
Inder Pratap's son is in the viIIage.

490
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,770
I wouId have kiIIed him that
very day but uncIe heId my arm.

491
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:15,044
''Even if I have to attack sIyIy,
I won't be at peace tiII he's dead''

492
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,554
Stop it. The sound
is driving me nuts!

493
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:22,785
Thanks for teIIing us you are nuts.

494
00:44:31,134 --> 00:44:32,761
Going for a movie?

495
00:44:33,136 --> 00:44:35,832
In the viIIage one must
try the buIIock cart.

496
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,108
Isn't the tractor a viIIage vehicIe?

497
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:40,840
Right, brother.''

498
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:44,045
Going for the matinee
or 3 o'cIock show?

499
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,045
The matinee show.

500
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,053
At this speed you won't
make it for the evening show.

501
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,056
''Those who want to watch
the matinee, join me.''

502
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,758
We have pIace for one more.

503
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,495
I don't go with shameIess men.

504
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,104
But I do.

505
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:12,108
Don't deIay us. We'II miss
the movie. Join us fast.

506
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,058
She has come!

507
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,601
Had to come after the fuss.

508
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:46,041
Don't be under any iIIusions.
I'm here because it's my grandpa's.

509
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,544
I never said it
beIongs to your husband.

510
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,378
- My husband won't drive tractors
- Does he drive a Iorry?

511
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,049
Hush, don't' say that.''

512
00:45:58,121 --> 00:45:59,713
I'm in the driving seat
It wiII appear as if I...

513
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:01,715
You're my husband!

514
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,061
''If you were, I'd mix
poison in your tea.''

515
00:46:06,129 --> 00:46:09,098
I'd joyfuIIy drink the tea
if you were my wife.

516
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:12,499
''HoId on kids, I'm
increasing the speed.''

517
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:15,036
Just as the tractor is grandpa's...

518
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,030
I too beIong to him.

519
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:20,042
''You may hoId on to me,
nobody wiII bat an eyeIid.''

520
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,670
- HoId me.

521
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,051
HoId on.

522
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,062
Brother's cap!

523
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:54,043
Switch off the engine.
They're wiId animaIs.

524
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,038
They'II crush you if they get mad.

525
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,536
Why are you pushing me?

526
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:24,039
- This armrest is mine.
- Where shouId I keep my arm?

527
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:25,771
There's another that side.

528
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,775
ShouId I keep this arm there?

529
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,773
Keep it on my shouIder.

530
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,539
ShameIess!

531
00:47:57,074 --> 00:48:00,043
''Listen, the boy
behind is kicking me.''

532
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,047
Sit straight or I'II break your Ieg!

533
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,641
TeII me if he repeats it.

534
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:12,554
Sit here.

535
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:17,753
- Come to my seat.
- Yes brother.

536
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:22,826
''- Are you in a garden?
- Red cap, sit down!''

537
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,020
What's your name?

538
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,564
What a great name.
Know her name?

539
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,101
- She didn't ask for my name.
- So what?

540
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,866
- Where are you from?
- Bombay.

541
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,835
I'm aIso from there.

542
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:08,111
This poor girI is from the viIIage.

543
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,613
- She didn't ask.
- So what?

544
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,778
Now she's Ieft the viIIage
and stays in a city.

545
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,450
She has aIso Iearnt EngIish.

546
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,452
Where do you Iive in Bombay?

547
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,051
What?

548
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,560
When wiII you come there to meet me?

549
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,499
The joke wasn't' so funny.

550
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:38,898
But you didn't answer her
When wiII you go?

551
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,112
I want chocoIate not ice cream!

552
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,115
You don't get chocoIate here.
Shut your mouth and eat.

553
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,848
How wiII I eat if I shut my mouth?

554
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,111
I'II give you the chocoIate.

555
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:54,448
- Give me the comb.
- Here.

556
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,564
Abracadabra...

557
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,910
How did you do that?

558
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:24,609
You aIways carry chocoIates
in your pocket to bribe kids.

559
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,986
You don't beIieve me?
You have doubts?

560
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,558
Give me something of yours.

561
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,959
- Give me your braceIet.
- Why?

562
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:39,635
Because I wiII...
turn it into sweetmeat.

563
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,002
AII right. Here you are.

564
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,108
Abracadabra.

565
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:07,129
- Fresh for aII of us...
- Give me some.

566
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,665
Everyone eat some.

567
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,566
This tastes just Iike a sweetmeat.

568
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:15,103
We want more.
Give him your ring.

569
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,698
I understand everything.

570
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,774
Return my braceIet.

571
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:27,116
That turned into a sweet
and we aII ate it up.

572
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:36,590
Your sweets.

573
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,158
I asked for 4.
Your brought onIy 3

574
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,708
I knew it.

575
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:05,711
We're home.

576
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:11,156
What happened?

577
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,101
What is the meaning of sIeeping here?

578
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:24,596
Meaning man can sIeep
on a sack when he is tired.

579
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:04,613
Is this MangaIa's braceIet?

580
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,776
Yes... I found it downstairs.

581
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:11,518
MangaIa said you took it
to show some magic trick.

582
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:14,116
Yes, just Iike that.''

583
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,490
You're faIIing in Iove with her.

584
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:22,087
''- Mother... - Look, aIready
your grandpa is annoyed with us.''

585
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:27,092
If he finds out, it wiII be bad.''

586
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:33,098
I hear he's finding her a
groom in his near reIatives.

587
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:43,619
Who couId be cIoser to him than us?

588
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,109
- Sweets...
- You shouId have toId me.

589
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,612
It's not my birthday
I want my braceIet back.

590
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:14,116
- What braceIet?
- The one you took Iast night.

591
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,452
That was no excuse. In front
of you I turned it into a sweet.

592
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:21,420
- Was it sweet?
- Yes.

593

Now I'm giving you sweets.
PIease return my braceIet.

594
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:27,824
This sweet can't
turn into a braceIet.

595
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:35,764
- I'II get a sweet from the
same shop. - That won't do.

596
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,505
We need the same sweet you ate.

597
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,641
God, save me from her!''

598
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,491
PIease iron my pant and shirt fast.

599
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,107
He's gone there again.

Everyone is mad.

Look, his trousers are torn.''

617
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:55,766
Hanuman took Rama's ring

619

Naughty boy!

- First he teased me.
- So what?

630
00:59:13,649 --> 00:59:16,049
He has the right.
He's the reaI heir

631
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,452
And you are the grand
daughter I adopted.

Don't you dare show it
to anyone! Return it to me!

656
01:05:09,638 --> 01:05:11,606
This isn't right.

657

Where are you going?

''I have your picture,

663
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,774
I was checking saIt not eating dough.

664
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,440
That's an oId excuse.

665
01:05:47,676 --> 01:05:50,543
''Here's grandma's picture,

Now give them back.

669
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:02,047
Haven't you taken
these pictures for us?

670
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,492
No...

671
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,098
I wiII take them back.

672
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:20,037
Deepa and I have never known
what it's Iike to have famiIy.

673
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,041
The Iove of grandparents.

Aunt's joviaI pranks.

675
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:30,711
The morseIs fed by grandma...

676
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:37,088
The Iast week went by Iike a dream.

677
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,088
I'd never want to forget it.

678
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:46,426
We'II go back after the ceremony.

679
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,767
And I know you'II

680
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:56,710
That is why I want to

681
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,372
When I fight my first case...

682

I'II first stand before
grandpa and grandma's picture...

683
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,054
And I'II take their bIessings.

684
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,051
And they wiII bIess me.

685
01:07:13,128 --> 01:07:14,527
When my sister's marriage is fixed...

686
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,429
I'II send cards to aII of you.

687
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,795
But none of you wiII turn up.

688
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:21,764
Not grandma... not grandpa...

689
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:23,766
No aunts or uncIes.

690
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,542
I wiII be sad.

691
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:31,780
But I am confident you'II
bIess her through the pictures.

692
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:43,051
Why is everyone serious?

693
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:45,788
Let me show you a super photograph.

694
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:00,541
This used to beIong to Inder.

695
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,775
You wear it.

696
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,707
No, grandma.''

697
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:09,641
Grandpa might not approve.

698
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:17,058
But someday if he voIuntariIy
asks me to wear it...

699
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:18,823
I wiII definiteIy wear it.

700
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:30,503
Master...

701
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:43,607
- Carry me too...
- Me first. - Tomorrow.

702
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,820
Looking great in this dress.

703
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:55,756
ActuaIIy this wouId have
Iooked better on Sundari.

704
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:04,097
Can you ride the cycIe
or do you have to be taught?

705
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,768
I'm the cycIing champ
and I aIways stand first.

706
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:10,111
My brother is aIways
first in running races.

707
01:09:11,146 --> 01:09:13,114
My sister is number 1

708
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,039
My brother too is number 1

709
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,452
''In a fIash, we'II know
who is number 1''

710
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:23,719
The one who gets a Iotus from
the tempIe Iake is first. Okay?

711
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:25,491
Yes, we accept.''

712
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,093
Somebody ask me...

713
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:29,091
I don't compete with girIs.

714
01:09:29,531 --> 01:09:31,829
Scared? Is that why
you're making excuses?

715
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:34,096
Brother, it's a matter of honour.''

716
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,487
She's aIready Ieft.

717
01:09:57,192 --> 01:09:58,557
She'II come back here.

718
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:01,160
Hurry or we'II Iose the bet.

719
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,699
The fear of faiIure
made him stay back.

720
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,614
Hurry up.

721
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:27,111
- For what?
- Grandma's food made me gain weight

722
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:29,857
Your chaIIenge wiII make me Iose 2 kiIos

723
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:31,716
What's your weight?

724
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,129
I asked your body weight
not of your head.

725
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:41,669
Now do you know my weight?

726
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,833
The poor things handIe is twisted.

727
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,108
I'm hurt bad.

728
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,510
''- Not this, heIp me.''

729
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,114
Get up.

730
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:41,560
WiII you be abIe to ride?

731
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,102
''AII right, you sit in front
and I'II ride it.''

732
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:08,850
Made friends with you for Iife

733
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:14,754
Made friends with you for Iife

734
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,108
I knew it.

735
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:36,117
Got her on the cycIe so soon?

736
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,780
Looks Iike very soon
we'II get marriage sweets.

737
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:46,059
Go about your work.
TaIks nonsense!

738
01:12:46,461 --> 01:12:51,899
Forget it. Those that fight the
bitterest aIways faII in Iove.

739
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:54,830
That's what the worId says.

740
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:56,502
Go now...

741
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:01,769
She has a Iotus in hand
so she has won.

742
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:05,104
My brother can't Iose to her.

743
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:07,513
TeII us what happened.

744
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,114
I Iost.

745
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,753
Yes, I Iost.''

746
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:19,059
MangaIa won!!

747
01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:24,087
She won!!

748
01:13:33,141 --> 01:13:35,609
I understand this
faIse winning and Iosing.

749
01:13:36,144 --> 01:13:40,911
Count the reaI victory when
you get grandpa's bIessings.

750
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,044
The hearts met

751
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,775
I have faIIen in Iove

752
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:52,042
The hearts met and feII in Iove

753
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:59,589
Made friends with you for Iife

754
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:05,088
Made friends with you for Iife

755
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:11,097
The hearts met and feII in Iove

756
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:22,050
The hearts met and feII in Iove

757
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:29,048
The hearts met and feII in Iove

758
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:36,086
Made friends with you for Iife

759
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:37,057
It's a strange feeIing

760
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:40,060
My first Iove

761
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:44,360
I'm feeIing restIess

762
01:16:45,066 --> 01:16:50,026
''In the dark and the night
I am Iost in the Iight''

763
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:54,636
It's a wonderfuI age

764
01:16:57,078 --> 01:17:01,708
''I created Iight by
Iighting Iamps of Iove''

765
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:07,551
''I created Iight by
Iighting Iamps of Iove''

766
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:59,530
I see you everywhere I go

767
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:03,778
You guard me everywhere

768
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,048
You are in my senses

769
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,051
You're in the vaIIeys

770
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,714
I see your face everywhere

771
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:21,827
I'II die if you Ieave me

772
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:27,090
I'II die if you Ieave me

773
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:25,716
What a doctor. Hurt on one
knee and dressing the other.

774
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:27,758
I'm scared.

775
01:19:28,129 --> 01:19:29,756
- It wiII sting.
- I'II appIy it.

776
01:19:30,131 --> 01:19:31,496
It won't sting.

777
01:19:33,134 --> 01:19:35,762
I promise to appIy it
without being naughty.

778
01:19:37,138 --> 01:19:39,106
Okay, I'II be naughty.''

779
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:53,620
Does it hurt?

780
01:19:58,193 --> 01:20:01,890
Why did you accept defeat
though you had won?

781
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,824
ShaII I be honest?

782
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,565
The compIete truth?

783
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,166
You had grazed your knee.

784
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:15,108
TeIIing the truth wouId have
been scraping the wound.

785
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:30,555
Very weII.

786
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:38,157
''If I don't make you confess
that you Iove me, I'm not MangaIa.''

787
01:20:41,202 --> 01:20:43,670
- Good day sir.
- Good day.

788
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:46,107
- How are you?
- Very weII by your grace.

789
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:49,508
How come aII of you
Ianded up together?

790
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:51,578
We came for your advice.

791
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:56,516
- About what? - This year
we were pIanning a fair

792
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:59,120
Ahead of the mother's tempIe.

793
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:03,123
The engineer's words have scared us.

794
01:21:03,858 --> 01:21:07,157
The dam is weak. If it
breaks at the Iast moment...

795
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,129
Be optimist.

796
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:10,828
Don't' say that.

797
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,101
AdmittedIy the dam must be
repaired at the earIiest.

798
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:16,868
It's not so bad.

799
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:20,573
- Do you trust in the goddess?
- Yes.

800
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:24,111
Arrange the fair.
Mother wiII take care.

801
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:33,780
PIay with the rings.

802
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:36,623
Win a naiI poIish
and pIease the women.

803
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:39,626
- Win naiI poIish...
- Brother the naiI poIish.

804
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:46,100
Ask your magician to
get it with his magic.

805
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,764
Whatever articIe you
ring becomes yours.

806
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:52,606
Such a nice toy.

807
01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:00,614
Any articIe that I ring becomes mine?

808
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:02,110
AbsoIuteIy.

809
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:05,619
She Iost!

810
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,117
It's not so easy to
possess everything in Iife.

811
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:18,827
- Pass it here.
- Then what wiII I eat?

812
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:23,434
Exchange your Iuck.
Exchange the rings.

813
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:30,873
He meant this ring.

814
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,108
What brother...?

815
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:36,108
Run, Rudra is here!''

816
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:42,885
- This is injustice.
- We know

817
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:44,920
You're a government servant.
Take your saIary and shut up.

818
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:48,061
There's no need to act smart
and write to the government.

819
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:53,100
But we wiII have to
make a hoIe in the dam.

820
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:54,935
No hoIe wiII be made!

821
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:59,436
We've got a stay order for it.
Show it to them!

822
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:01,768
- This is...
- We know a stay order.

823
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:05,112
''If we touch the dam for
2 minutes, there'II be a hoIe.''

824
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,445
TaIking to them is pointIess.

825
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:12,449
The Iaw is not for fooIing around.

826
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:16,088
Does the Iaw aIIow you
to drown and kiII peopIe?

827
01:23:50,124 --> 01:23:52,854
- How do you know Iaw
- I'm a Iaw graduate.

828
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:57,597
Why did you shut up?

829
01:23:59,133 --> 01:24:00,691
What he's saying is right.

830
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:05,094
He can cite risk to human Iife
and get our stay order annuIIed

831
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,104
In fact he can aIso send us to jaiI.

832
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:10,774
The boy knows Iaw.

833
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:18,052
Who are you?
What's your name?

834
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:26,059
Are you Vishnu's grandson?

835
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:30,097
- Yes.
- OnIy a Iion begets a Iion!

836
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:33,692
The grandson wiII bring
honour to the grandfather's name.

837
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:36,831
HaiI Abhay Nirbhisht Pratap Singh!

838
01:24:58,126 --> 01:25:02,495
I wiII wear it the day grandpa
voIuntariIy gives it to me.

839
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:07,499
Son...

840
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:10,832
Today I'II put this
chain round your neck.

841
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,903
Grandpa is very happy today.

842
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:17,043
Don't miss this opportunity.
Ask for MangaIa's hand in marriage.

843
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:23,880
You came for the oId coupIe's wedding

844
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:25,882
Why are you interfering
in viIIage matters?

845
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,054
The matter is in court.
That's where it wiII be decided.

846
01:25:29,123 --> 01:25:31,057
I am the court and
the Iaw in this viIIage.

847
01:25:32,126 --> 01:25:34,754
Just because you speak EngIish
wiII you become the viIIage Ieader?

848
01:25:35,129 --> 01:25:36,756
WiII you make a hoIe in the dam?

849
01:25:38,132 --> 01:25:39,759
''If it isn't done,
the dam wiII burst.''

850
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:41,761
Many peopIe wiII drown in it's waters

851
01:25:42,136 --> 01:25:45,037
''And if the hoIe is made,
peopIe wiII die a bIoody death.''

852
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:48,034
- Mark my words.
- How many wiII you kiII?

853
01:25:48,843 --> 01:25:51,710
First of aII I'II run your famiIy.

854
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:56,710
I'II massacre your grandpa before
you and sacrifice him to the tempIe.

855
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:11,557
Abhay, no...''

856
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:40,044
Stop it! Stop!

857
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,493
Why have you come here?

858
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:49,495
For what?

859
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:52,762
Once your father Iit this fire!

860
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:55,433
Our happy famiIies are
stiII burning in it.

861
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:58,436
Today you have come to
add fueI to that fire!

862
01:28:03,077 --> 01:28:05,773
I'm trying hard to regain
the Iove of that famiIy...

863
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,547
You are washing away my efforts

864
01:28:09,484 --> 01:28:11,850
Your father spIit us in two!

865
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,487
But Iooks Iike you want
to spIit the entire viIIage!

866
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,754
Go... go away from here!

867
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:24,098
You're not required here.
Leave the viIIage.

868
01:28:41,682 --> 01:28:43,980
I knew I'd find you here

869
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:47,919
Sad? Because grandpa sIapped you?

870
01:28:50,424 --> 01:28:56,124
Your anger is justified.
But grandpa's anger was justified too

871
01:28:59,066 --> 01:29:02,058
You know who Rudra Pratap is?
- No

872
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,897
Then you aIso don't know
who Iives across the street

873
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:10,905
It's grandpa's sister's house

874
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:18,179
She was Grandpa's onIy sister.
And she was cIose to him

875
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:22,650
So he got her to marry
his friend Virendra Pratap

876
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:28,488
The marriage didn't estrange
brother and sister

877
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,960
During every auspicious occasion...

878
01:29:31,098 --> 01:29:33,225
Grandpa insisted
that his sister participates

879
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:38,972
Whatever he bought for his wife
he wouId aIso buy for his sister

880
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,771
Virendra Pratap and
his brother Narendra Pratap...

881
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:45,376
had such high regards
for grandpa

882
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:50,511
And everyone wanted the reIationship
to continue down the generations

883
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:54,987
When Narendra Pratap's daughter
came of age...

884
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:58,582
''a marriage was proposed,
to your daddy, Indra Pratap''

885
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:04,961
''As a girI, she had been toId, that
someday she wouId wed Indra Pratap''

886
01:30:08,002 --> 01:30:12,564
Why are you siIent, son? Speak''

887
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:18,304
''Virendra Pratap, it's upto you
to extract a consent from him''

888
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:25,979
''You see Indra, you are marrying
Narendra's daughter Amrita''

889
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:29,545
And I've aIso found a suitabIe boy
for my daughter Shanti

890
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:33,993
So why don't we give both the girIs
a wedding on the same day?

891
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:36,396
What do you think?

892
01:30:38,065 --> 01:30:40,693
It's my finaI year in coIIege.
- So...?

893
01:30:41,135 --> 01:30:44,434
I can't think about getting married

894
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:48,968
Inder is right. AII these years...

895
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:52,704
he has toiIed. Let's not ruin his
efforts for our seIfish ends

896
01:30:53,147 --> 01:31:01,316
Let's postpone the wedding.
As of now Iet them get engaged

897
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:05,556
And Iet's proceed with Shanti's wedding
By this time next year...

898
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:10,930
''Inder and Amrita wiII be married. Okay?
- Yes, that sounds fine''

899
01:31:11,465 --> 01:31:12,762
Right

900
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:17,298
''Indra, I hope you have no objections
about getting engaged?''

901
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:23,636
That's where your daddy sIipped.
He bought himseIf a year

902
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:28,974
But at the crux was his affair with
your mother. He never said that

903
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:35,578
''Time stops for no one
and in no time, a year had gone by''

904
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:39,755
And it was the date
that had been fixed for the wedding

905
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:44,754
''Sister, wear a bIack dot
to ward off the eviI eye''

906
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,137
My sister-in-Iaw is Iooking exotic

907
01:31:54,508 --> 01:31:56,976
Stop it! You know what everyone
is taIking about?

908
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:00,572
The size of my pregnancy
and it's not quite a year

909
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:05,915
You must carry the gifts
to the bridegroom's house

910
01:32:07,988 --> 01:32:10,081
Mr Inder just Ieft
for the raiIway station

911
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:13,316
I think he's headed for Mumbai!
- What...?

912
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:31,143
Mr Inder Ieft this Ietter for you

913
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:39,976
''Daddy, I can't marry Amrita.
I'm in Iove with someone eIse''

914
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:43,981
''I'm going to marry her.
Forgive me, if you can''

915
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:44,913
Brother! How couId this happen?

916
01:33:45,352 --> 01:33:46,910
Stay away

917
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:54,517
Why did you keep us in the dark
about your son's affair?

918
01:33:54,995 --> 01:34:00,900
''Virendra Pratap, I knew nothing.
- You shouId've known''

919
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:05,394
Citing ignorance doesn't mitigate
the circumstances of my ruination

920
01:34:06,941 --> 01:34:12,709
Virendra Pratap... it's true...
I hadn't an inkIing... had I known...

921
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:18,580
Rudra! What are you doing? Drop it!
- Let go of me

922
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:23,688
A boy! And that's what he's upto!
And you won't stop your son?

923
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:28,928
Get out of here!
It's aII over

924
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,490
Go away

925
01:35:02,062 --> 01:35:04,292
Stop aII this! PIease

926
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,164
''That day, aII heII broke Ioose.
Your father's one mistake...''

927
01:35:44,471 --> 01:35:47,907
destroyed Virendra Pratap's famiIy

928
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:52,708
No one can fuIIy understand
Grandpa's grief

929
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:58,641
His sister Iives across the street
but he can't even ask her how she is

930
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:04,891
He can't even Iook at the house
he once considered his own home

931
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:12,296
''So he keeps to his rituaIs,
praying for peace...''

932
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:20,237
praying that the two famiIies
come together again

933
01:36:22,643 --> 01:36:26,704
And he Iived in hope... that someday
Virendra Pratap wouId once again...

934
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:28,915
extend his hand of friendship

935
01:36:32,353 --> 01:36:37,916
And then you assauIted Rudra Pratap.
That was too much for your grandfather

936
01:36:50,404 --> 01:36:53,373
''Abhay, we are Ieaving.
At daybreak tomorrow''

937
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:58,638
I'm not about to toIerate
your insuIt in pubIic

938
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:04,380
''No Abhay! The Iast time,
I stopped you from Ieaving''

939
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:07,818
''Now I'm teIIing you,
tomorrow we're Ieaving for Mumbai''

940
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:10,813
That Iast time, you toId me...''

941
01:37:11,258 --> 01:37:13,624
''when your eIders are angry,
it's onIy superficiaI''

942
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:17,957
''Deep down under, you'II find
Iots of Iove. You toId me that''

943
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:23,961
''You were so right, Ma.
We aren't going away''

944
01:37:25,372 --> 01:37:27,340
Abhay...
- Yes?

945
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:32,977
Inviting you over was a grave mistake
You have been insuIted

946
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:35,975
I feeI responsibIe.
- Come on grandma...

947
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:39,316
what grandson takes a sIap from
his grandfather for an insuIt?

948
01:37:41,722 --> 01:37:44,316
Think... had I Iived here
aII my Iife...

949
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:47,955
I wouId've had my fair share...
of beatings and some Iove

950
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:55,367
He'd gIadIy Iet me cIimb his back
and he'd punish me just as harshIy

951
01:37:58,672 --> 01:38:04,440
Let's make Iight of whatever happened.
I hope grandpa didn't hurt his hand

952
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:14,918
''Come on, grandma!
You think I'II Ieave...?''

953
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:20,926
Because he screamed at me
and toId me to get out...? No

954
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:24,527
''In truth, I'm gIad.
For the first time, he touched me...''

955
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:29,829
''he acknowIedged me in pubIic,
he toId everyone, I'm his grandson''

956
01:38:33,173 --> 01:38:36,370
''Not to forget, the rebuke
is meant for someone dear''

957
01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:38,705
My baby...

958
01:38:41,148 --> 01:38:43,981
Come on grandma, don't cry''

959
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:58,755
The buckets are fiIIed with water
for your bath

960
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,438
BucketfuIs? To drown myseIf in?

961
01:39:06,673 --> 01:39:09,073
You're getting worked up for nothing.
- For nothing?

962
01:39:11,044 --> 01:39:14,309
You teII your nephew
to use his brains

963
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:19,913
He was to bIame. But your brother
sIapped his grandson

964
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:23,715
Shamed me in pubIic! And you say
I'm getting worked up for nothing?

965
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:31,688
You shouId Iace that miIk
with a tonic for the brain

966
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,299
Ask him to desist

967
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:40,132
Yes...?

968
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:45,706
''So you've been toId to Iecture me?
- No, I just brought you your miIk''

969
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:49,175
Come on

970
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:52,979
''What everyone eIse has forgotten,
I haven't''

971
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,216
I haven't forgotten the fIames
that took my sister's Iife

972
01:39:57,057 --> 01:39:59,992
I haven't forgotten my father's death.
I haven't forgotten anything

973
01:40:04,998 --> 01:40:06,898
I'm not going to spare him

974
01:40:08,001 --> 01:40:10,970
No, this is impossibIe''

975
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:15,366
You expect me to do nothing and
hope for things to mend with time?

976
01:40:18,612 --> 01:40:24,983
No... I'II mend the fences

977
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:29,648
''Before I Ieave, I'II make sure
the famiIies are re-united''

978
01:40:30,557 --> 01:40:33,492
And the time is near.
- May God wiII so

979
01:40:35,128 --> 01:40:38,029
Yes, may God wiII so''

980
01:40:38,565 --> 01:40:43,502
I'm going away for a hoIiday.
If the dam deveIops cracks...

981
01:40:44,071 --> 01:40:47,973
inform the office.
- Have nothing to worry

982
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:53,774
''Come on, row us over. We got to be
at the tempIe in time for prayers''

983
01:40:56,183 --> 01:40:59,710
''Forgive me, the engine is cIogged.
PIease take the other boat''

984
01:41:00,087 --> 01:41:02,920
Your boat aIways goes kaput
just when it's needed most

985
01:41:03,423 --> 01:41:07,621
Never mind which boat. As Iong
as we reach the tempIe in time

986
01:41:34,788 --> 01:41:37,723
Do I put the Iuggage down?
Or are we going back?

987
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:44,027
Why shouId we go back?
Nobody here owns this boat. Sit

988
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:58,969
''I'm hungry. Give me something to eat.
- Yes, one minute''

989
01:42:14,161 --> 01:42:15,594
Who's that?

990
01:42:18,999 --> 01:42:21,968
They fIy pIanes!
But they don't have civic sense

991
01:42:23,403 --> 01:42:24,961
Morons

992
01:42:26,506 --> 01:42:28,303
Who's that again...?

993
01:42:29,009 --> 01:42:30,977
Coming up from Iower deck...?

994
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:32,710
My gIasses

995
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:41,454
I must see the optician!
Am I haIIucinating...?

996
01:42:41,788 --> 01:42:44,313
Virendra Pratap and Vishnu Pratap!
Together...?

997
01:42:44,691 --> 01:42:48,252
Are they friends again?
The other astroIoger was wrong!

998
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:51,790
You didn't know?
- Never did

999
01:42:52,032 --> 01:42:55,763
HeIIo Mr Virendra Pratap!
HeIIo Mr Vishnu Pratap! I said it

1000
01:42:56,003 --> 01:43:00,702
''23 and a haIf years ago,
I predicted this reunion''

1001
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:07,470
And that astroIoger ruIed it out!
- Now Iisten to me... good God...

1002
01:43:07,948 --> 01:43:12,647
Lord be praised! I warned you
about the timing of the wedding

1003
01:43:12,953 --> 01:43:16,582
It was inopportune!
But no one Iistened. And the outcome?

1004
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:18,924
This one became a widow

1005
01:43:19,393 --> 01:43:21,759
''WeII Ms Sunanda, how does it feeI to be
taIking to your sister-in-Iaw again?''

1006
01:43:21,995 --> 01:43:24,225
Listen to me!
- Shut up

1007
01:43:24,798 --> 01:43:26,766
Didn't I say?
WiII come the day...

1008
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,298
when Virendra Pratap wiII faII
at Vishnu Pratap's feet...

1009
01:43:29,436 --> 01:43:31,768
and he wiII apoIogise and he wiII seek
Vishnu Pratap's bIessings...

1010
01:43:31,905 --> 01:43:33,770
''and he did, didn't he?
- Listen...''

1011
01:43:34,007 --> 01:43:35,474
Shut up!

1012
01:43:37,077 --> 01:43:42,982
And Mr Rudra Pratap... do you stiII
disown your uncIe and aunt?

1013
01:43:44,017 --> 01:43:48,716
''You apoIogise with foIded hands!
At your age, you stiII haven't sense?''

1014
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:54,386
So I was the faII guy!
Rudra waIIoped me

1015
01:43:54,661 --> 01:43:56,959
My ears wiII go on ringing
for a week

1016
01:43:57,264 --> 01:44:01,598
These famiIies can never be reconciIed
not in seven generations

1017
01:44:01,935 --> 01:44:04,563
That's what I predict!
Mark my words

1018
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:13,707
TaIk of reconciIiation and you get hit
taIk of discord and you stiII get hit

1019
01:44:14,114 --> 01:44:19,916
''What a diIemma! Worse, I took
both of them on the same cheek''

1020
01:44:27,794 --> 01:44:30,627
''Lord, this time next year, I want
to stand before You with Abhay...''

1021
01:44:30,864 --> 01:44:33,560
as man and wife

1022
01:44:35,068 --> 01:44:38,231
Lord, reunite our famiIies''

1023
01:44:39,339 --> 01:44:43,969
''I wish my grandfather accepts me,
then I can ask for MangaIa's hand''

1024
01:44:49,182 --> 01:44:52,413
NewIy-wedded coupIes are the ones
who seek the bIessings of their eIders

1025
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:56,650
It's aIso a bIessing to touch
the feet of a coupIe...

1026
01:44:56,990 --> 01:45:02,895
who have crossed their sixtieth year.
So pay them your obeisances

1027
01:45:22,949 --> 01:45:24,439
Let's go

1028
01:45:25,952 --> 01:45:27,920
BIess you

1029
01:45:31,091 --> 01:45:35,289
Kids, don't get Iost''

1030
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:48,702
What do you want today?
ChocoIate or ice cream?

1031
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:59,652
''Shut your eyes, count tiII five
and you'II find an ice cream''

1032
01:45:59,953 --> 01:46:01,853
Get back to me soon

1033
01:46:04,057 --> 01:46:06,525
Don't open your eyes
before the count of five

1034
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:09,894
One... two... three...

1035
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:12,894
four... five...

1036
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:17,697
Where's he gone...?
Brother...

1037
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:32,646
''This kid is Iost.
- No, he's just crying''

1038
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:36,513
''Baby, why are you crying?
- I came here with 14 peopIe''

1039
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:41,955
I've Iost them.
- 14 peopIe are Iost!

1040
01:46:42,395 --> 01:46:48,493
''No, this kid is Iost.
- Lost kid...? Moron''

1041
01:46:49,936 --> 01:46:53,895
We'II try to find at Ieast two
or three of them. Now don't cry

1042
01:46:57,377 --> 01:46:59,902
''Stop Iaughing,
the kid is sensitive''

1043
01:47:00,947 --> 01:47:03,415
Where's the famiIy?
- Come and take your kid

1044
01:47:04,451 --> 01:47:06,715
No famiIy...? Or is there?
- Take your kid

1045
01:47:08,154 --> 01:47:13,592
That famiIy waIking towards us...
the kid is reIated to them

1046
01:47:14,995 --> 01:47:18,761
How do you know that?
- Because I'm his brother

1047
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,458
So they're reIatives
and you're the brother...?

1048
01:47:24,004 --> 01:47:26,632
Good God! Am I dreaming?

1049
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:30,975
I see a kid. You see a dream?
- You're taIkative

1050
01:47:32,379 --> 01:47:37,976
Wait... heIIo foIks...
do you know this kid?

1051
01:47:39,419 --> 01:47:40,283
No

1052
01:47:40,453 --> 01:47:42,978
''He's Gauri's son,
my brother's grandson''

1053
01:47:45,992 --> 01:47:47,926
I toId you, we don't know him''

1054
01:47:48,161 --> 01:47:53,963
They Iive in the house in front of
my grandfather's house

1055
01:47:57,470 --> 01:48:02,169
Wrong! You don't make a kid suffer
for what Iooks Iike a famiIy pIot

1056
01:48:02,609 --> 01:48:04,702
Take him to his mother, pIease''

1057
01:48:07,347 --> 01:48:08,905
Come, son''

1058
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:17,621
Come on grand-uncIe.
Grand-aunt wiII tire

1059
01:48:17,991 --> 01:48:23,361
''Take me in your arms.
PIease, I want to be with you''

1060
01:48:32,072 --> 01:48:34,131
''Where's Chintu?
- He was right here, pIaying''

1061
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,969
Have you seen him?
- Where he has gone?

1062
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:45,576
Where do we Iook for him
in these crowds?

1063
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:48,514
Look... over there

1064
01:48:48,855 --> 01:48:52,916
Why don't you shave?
Your beard has grown so Iong

1065
01:49:20,153 --> 01:49:23,316
''Thank God they found him.
EIse, what wouId've happened?''

1066
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:28,427
''You went wandering, did you?
- Abhay said, if I want an ice cream...''

1067
01:49:28,995 --> 01:49:31,691
If you wanted an ice cream
you shouId've toId me so

1068
01:49:45,912 --> 01:49:47,971
What did you pray for?
- If I reveaI it...

1069
01:49:48,181 --> 01:49:50,479
my prayers won't be granted.
- Who says?

1070
01:49:51,151 --> 01:49:53,984
I know how to make wishes come true.
- How...?

1071
01:49:54,621 --> 01:49:59,581
Take a dip in the river and hoId your
breath under water for 3 minutes

1072
01:50:00,059 --> 01:50:01,959
And your wish is given

1073
01:50:05,064 --> 01:50:06,964
ReaIIy...?
Very weII

1074
01:50:08,601 --> 01:50:11,126
Where are you going?
- To take a dip

1075
01:50:11,504 --> 01:50:14,769
I was just joking! Listen...
In 3 minutes...

1076
01:50:15,008 --> 01:50:16,976
your puIse rate wiII be Iow enough
to kiII you

1077
01:50:17,177 --> 01:50:21,705
Time me by your watch.
- Listen... even 2 minutes wiII do

1078
01:50:22,015 --> 01:50:24,984
3 minutes by your watch.
- CarefuI! It's deep

1079
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,194
What happened?

1080
01:51:48,434 --> 01:51:50,959
Are you sobbing?
- You nearIy kiIIed me

1081
01:51:51,905 --> 01:51:56,968
You might've never surfaced!
Why do you do this to me?

1082
01:52:02,282 --> 01:52:07,914
''Because, to each his own miseries.
- I'm never going to taIk to you again''

1083
01:52:35,181 --> 01:52:37,376
Ever since I met you...

1084
01:52:37,717 --> 01:52:42,654
I've been Iost

1085
01:52:48,995 --> 01:52:51,225
Ever since I feII for you...

1086
01:52:51,531 --> 01:52:56,161
I've been Iost

1087
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:02,636
What I say isn't what I think

1088
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:07,436
What I want isn't what I ask for

1089
01:53:08,681 --> 01:53:14,711
AII day, I'm in a daze''

1090
01:53:16,389 --> 01:53:18,584
Ever since I feII for you...

1091
01:53:18,992 --> 01:53:23,486
I'm Iost

1092
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:55,621
I forget my destination

1093
01:53:56,496 --> 01:54:00,899
''I caII out for you
then I find it's someone eIse''

1094
01:54:12,111 --> 01:54:16,605
I forget my destination

1095
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:21,448
''I caII out for you
then I find it's someone eIse''

1096
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:27,926
I don't feeI Iike dying

1097
01:54:29,662 --> 01:54:32,358
I don't feeI Iike Iiving

1098
01:54:34,634 --> 01:54:37,967
I don't feeI Iike eating

1099
01:54:39,739 --> 01:54:42,503
I don't feeI Iike drinking

1100
01:54:48,281 --> 01:54:53,913
AII day, I'm in daze''

1101
01:55:10,269 --> 01:55:14,535
''Sweet dreams of Iove
I dream''

1102
01:55:15,441 --> 01:55:19,901
When I'm aIone, I sob''

1103
01:55:43,136 --> 01:55:45,627
SoIitude is insufferabIe

1104
01:55:48,007 --> 01:55:51,534
There's someone I miss

1105
01:55:53,713 --> 01:55:56,477
Sometimes a spark ignites

1106
01:55:58,818 --> 01:56:01,343
Sometimes my heart misses a beat

1107
01:56:06,926 --> 01:56:12,887
AII day I'm in a daze

1108
01:56:14,767 --> 01:56:21,696
''Ever since I met you
I've been Iost''

1109
01:56:36,722 --> 01:56:39,919
Forgive me.
- Don't even speak to me

1110
01:56:46,032 --> 01:56:49,559
BIossom! Where are you hiding?
- What are you Iooking for?

1111
01:56:51,304 --> 01:56:54,569
Don't troubIe me.
- What is the matter?

1112
01:57:01,113 --> 01:57:04,708
''What are you Iooking for?
- My baby, my princess''

1113
01:57:05,017 --> 01:57:11,650
''My bIack beauty, my BIossom!
- But why down there? Is she tiny?''

1114
01:57:11,991 --> 01:57:13,754
She's as Iong as that!
- Long...?

1115
01:57:14,126 --> 01:57:20,622
You don't describe a girI as Iong.
- Can't describe her by height

1116
01:57:22,568 --> 01:57:24,763
She isn't human.
- Inhuman... what?

1117
01:57:25,004 --> 01:57:26,369
Snake

1118
01:57:27,006 --> 01:57:28,974
Snake... snake

1119
01:57:31,344 --> 01:57:32,641
Snake

1120
01:57:39,018 --> 01:57:40,986
My princess... my BIossom...

1121
01:57:42,021 --> 01:57:44,717
He has found the snake

1122
01:58:00,172 --> 01:58:06,634
''This is God's miracIe! It made them
come cIose, to protect each other''

1123
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:09,145
Lord be praised

1124
01:58:19,058 --> 01:58:21,754
BIossom! You made
Iife miserabIe for me

1125
01:58:22,495 --> 01:58:24,929
I've caught her.
You can Iet go of her

1126
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:39,978
What happened?
Where are they headed?

1127
01:58:40,179 --> 01:58:42,306
WiId eIephants
have waIked into your farm

1128
01:58:43,015 --> 01:58:46,246
Rudra! Fetch the gun.
Round up the bush beaters

1129
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:14,310
''Beat up drums,
set fire to crackers''

1130
01:59:35,401 --> 01:59:37,369
Go, chase the eIephants''

1131
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:34,319
Start it

1132
02:02:50,996 --> 02:02:52,964
Give me your hand

1133
02:03:31,337 --> 02:03:33,305
No time, fast''

1134
02:03:39,245 --> 02:03:41,509
Don't Iet go

1135
02:04:33,666 --> 02:04:35,634
Let's go, UncIe''

1136
02:04:47,212 --> 02:04:50,704

1138
02:04:58,190 --> 02:05:01,125
Abhay Indra Vishnu Pratap Singh

1139
02:05:13,839 --> 02:05:15,898
How is MangaIa?
- Fine

1140
02:05:19,645 --> 02:05:23,604
Who's he?
- Abhay. Inder's son

1141
02:05:25,951 --> 02:05:32,151
Inder's son...? I hope
he hasn't taken after his father

1142
02:05:32,891 --> 02:05:36,691
''Abhay, what are you doing?
- One minute, grandma''

1143
02:05:39,998 --> 02:05:43,126
Your dresses are exotic.
- That's why they're stored carefuIIy

1144
02:05:43,535 --> 02:05:47,130
What use storing them away?
Get dressed

1145
02:05:47,339 --> 02:05:49,705
We're going out to distribute cards.
- The invitations?

1146
02:05:49,942 --> 02:05:52,672
But they have been distributed.
- Have you invited your sister-in-Iaw?

1147
02:05:56,749 --> 02:05:59,309
Them...
- You must invite them personaIIy

1148
02:06:01,153 --> 02:06:07,114
''No son, they might throw us out.
- No they won't throw me out''

1149
02:06:07,593 --> 02:06:10,027
I'm Abhay Indra Vishnu Pratap Singh

1150
02:06:14,199 --> 02:06:16,167
This one is nice. Wear it

1151
02:06:34,953 --> 02:06:38,912
Come on Grandma. We aren't going back
without inviting them

1152
02:06:41,427 --> 02:06:43,622
Who's there...?
- No one

1153
02:06:43,996 --> 02:06:47,898
I think I heard that guy from Bombay.
- He's the onIy one you seem to hear

1154
02:06:54,339 --> 02:06:55,897
Sister-in-Iaw...?

1155
02:07:11,223 --> 02:07:12,850
''Grandmother, appIy the vermiIIion.
I'II give them the card''

1156
02:07:13,258 --> 02:07:15,954
I hear his voice...

1157
02:07:17,863 --> 02:07:19,797
Hurry...

1158
02:07:21,433 --> 02:07:24,163
''Moron, what have poured?
Pour water''

1159
02:07:25,904 --> 02:07:28,304
My eyes are burning...
put water on my head

1160
02:07:29,775 --> 02:07:32,642
Idiot! I wonder what you dream about...
- Water's over. I'II go and get some

1161
02:07:33,011 --> 02:07:35,138
Hurry up and get some

1162
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:56,091
These chiIdren are getting me
married to your brother again

1163
02:07:57,703 --> 02:08:01,400
You must forget the past
and be kind enough to attend

1164
02:08:16,855 --> 02:08:17,913
Namaste

1165
02:08:19,725 --> 02:08:23,252
It's a very auspicious day
in my grandparents' Iife

1166
02:08:23,495 --> 02:08:25,429
The whoIe viIIage wiII
assembIe at our pIace

1167
02:08:25,764 --> 02:08:29,200
If the onIy daughter and son-in-Iaw
of the famiIy don't show up...

1168
02:08:29,701 --> 02:08:31,669
we're going to miss something

1169
02:08:32,738 --> 02:08:34,262
PIease do come

1170
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:38,872
''Sir, there's a breach in the dam!
Everyone's going there''

1171
02:08:50,689 --> 02:08:52,623
Hurry

1172
02:09:02,034 --> 02:09:03,296
HoId it

1173
02:09:07,105 --> 02:09:11,565
''To prevent the fIow of water,
Iet's give it a direction in the north''

1174
02:09:11,944 --> 02:09:16,005
Let my fieIds be ruined...
but our viIIage must be saved

1175
02:09:50,182 --> 02:09:51,774
Where are you going?

1176
02:09:52,150 --> 02:09:55,415
There's a marriage in
the neighbourhood

1177
02:09:55,921 --> 02:09:57,684
Everyone eIse has gone there...
- So you're going too?

1178
02:09:58,156 --> 02:10:00,317
I'II go, if you aIIow me to''

1179
02:10:03,829 --> 02:10:05,797
Your bIood has Iost its coIor

1180
02:11:19,104 --> 02:11:21,971
Love each other...

1181
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:26,667
Iive for each other

1182
02:11:29,014 --> 02:11:31,209
May we never separate

1183
02:11:38,256 --> 02:11:41,316
''May we Iive together
aII our Iives''

1184
02:11:55,907 --> 02:11:58,307
BangIes...

1185
02:12:07,786 --> 02:12:10,914
''I wear bangIes
for my husband''

1186
02:12:39,017 --> 02:12:43,613
''Your hearts have met
and you are in Iove''

1187
02:12:44,089 --> 02:12:48,958
''You met when you couIdn't
take the pining anymore''

1188
02:12:55,667 --> 02:13:00,366
''The ankIets chimed,
the bangIes tinkIed''

1189
02:13:08,747 --> 02:13:10,908
BangIes

1190
02:13:13,952 --> 02:13:16,079
I'II wear bangIes for my beIoved

1191
02:13:19,090 --> 02:13:23,959
''In the bridaI headgear,
his hands adorned with henna...''

1192
02:13:24,663 --> 02:13:29,566
''he'II take me away some day
as his bride''

1193
02:13:30,101 --> 02:13:34,265
My beIoved wiII come some day

1194
02:13:40,745 --> 02:13:42,576
BangIes

1195
02:13:43,114 --> 02:13:45,139
I'II wear bangIes for my beIoved

1196
02:14:39,070 --> 02:14:44,133
''Hearts come together
on their own...''

1197
02:14:44,609 --> 02:14:48,670
''you can't ever break
the bond they share''

1198
02:14:49,948 --> 02:14:57,081
My Iove, take my hand''

1199
02:14:57,689 --> 02:15:00,385
I Iie at your feet

1200
02:15:00,859 --> 02:15:04,590
I'II remain with you aII my Iife

1201
02:15:05,931 --> 02:15:06,863
BangIes...

1202
02:16:24,642 --> 02:16:29,511
''The earth, the skies, the moon and
moonIight are never done apart...''

1203
02:16:29,948 --> 02:16:35,011
''without any bondage...
Iove binds them together''

1204
02:16:35,453 --> 02:16:37,421
Eyes...

1205
02:16:37,889 --> 02:16:39,948
your eyes, my eyes...''

1206
02:16:40,759 --> 02:16:45,662
''they couIdn't go to sIeep
aII night''

1207
02:16:46,131 --> 02:16:50,898
''I find peace onIy when
I Iook at you''

1208
02:16:51,536 --> 02:16:56,064
''BangIes... I'II wear
bangIes for my beIoved''

1209
02:16:56,741 --> 02:16:58,675
BangIes...

1210
02:17:41,019 --> 02:17:45,615
''Abhay, now is the time!
Grandpa's very happy''

1211
02:17:46,057 --> 02:17:49,288
Go and ask him for MangaIa's hand.
Go!

1212
02:17:53,765 --> 02:17:56,029
What happiness this house
is seeing

1213
02:17:56,401 --> 02:17:59,632
If one couId see it
in that house too...

1214
02:18:00,004 --> 02:18:04,338
it wouId make me so happy.
- Don't say this house and that house

1215
02:18:04,943 --> 02:18:06,570
The two houses are now one

1216
02:18:06,945 --> 02:18:10,711
''No, sir. Rudra's anger
hasn't cooIed down yet''

1217
02:18:11,149 --> 02:18:15,586
If there couId be a marriage
between the two famiIies...

1218
02:18:15,954 --> 02:18:18,252
it wouId reaIIy add
to our joy

1219
02:18:18,656 --> 02:18:20,590
What do you mean?
- Just think

1220
02:18:20,992 --> 02:18:23,358
A girI from this famiIy was
first married into that famiIy

1221
02:18:23,728 --> 02:18:26,288
I'm taIking about the mistress
But for some reason...

1222
02:18:26,664 --> 02:18:29,292
a girI from that famiIy
wasn't married in this one

1223
02:18:29,667 --> 02:18:32,067
It's the turn of this famiIy now
to give away a daughter to them

1224
02:18:33,004 --> 02:18:36,963
You mean...?
- Shanti's son is returning from the US

1225
02:18:37,375 --> 02:18:41,311
''And there's Jaikumar's daughter, the
one you treat Iike your granddaughter...''

1226
02:18:41,713 --> 02:18:44,705
''MangaIa, if the two of them
are married...''

1227
02:18:45,083 --> 02:18:47,574
it wouId certainIy bring both
the famiIies back together

1228
02:18:52,557 --> 02:18:55,492
He's right, Vishnu''

1229
02:18:57,996 --> 02:18:59,930
One marriage separated us...

1230
02:19:01,733 --> 02:19:04,896
we'II get together with another.
What do you say?

1231
02:19:06,671 --> 02:19:15,204
''What can make me happier?
But you must ask Jaikumar, not me''

1232
02:19:16,014 --> 02:19:19,848
''What are you saying? You have a
greater right to MangaIa, than me''

1233
02:19:20,218 --> 02:19:23,915
''Don't deIay this anymore, Abhay.
Before it gets out of hand...''

1234
02:19:24,322 --> 02:19:26,916
go and discuss it... Go!

1235
02:19:28,092 --> 02:19:34,463
''After years, I was very hesitant
when I stepped into this house again''

1236
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:42,462
''By agreeing to this aIIiance, you have
done this widow a great honour''

1237
02:19:44,075 --> 02:19:49,638
''So Virendra, Iet's find an auspicious
day and get them engaged''

1238
02:19:50,915 --> 02:19:58,083
''No, Vishnu. Engagements aren't for us.
We'II straightaway get them married''

1239
02:20:00,992 --> 02:20:02,084
AII right

1240
02:20:32,056 --> 02:20:33,683
Govind, take this''

1241
02:20:48,773 --> 02:20:51,970
''Abhay...
- Yes, grandpa?''

1242
02:20:53,111 --> 02:20:54,305
Come here

1243
02:20:59,717 --> 02:21:05,121
''My son, you have restored
the joy of our two famiIies''

1244
02:21:07,925 --> 02:21:11,918
''As my grandson, you have
done so much for me''

1245
02:21:14,699 --> 02:21:19,295
''But as your grandfather,
I've done nothing for you''

1246
02:21:20,705 --> 02:21:23,230
And so, after this wedding...''

1247
02:21:23,741 --> 02:21:28,542
I want your wedding procession
to Ieave from this very house

1248
02:21:30,415 --> 02:21:36,320
''If there is a girI you want
to marry, teII me my son''

1249
02:21:38,923 --> 02:21:45,658
I promise you... I'II get you married
to the girI you Iove. Okay...?

1250
02:21:47,598 --> 02:21:48,565
Okay?

1251
02:21:51,002 --> 02:21:52,128
AII right

1252
02:21:53,004 --> 02:21:54,528
There's another thing

1253
02:21:59,010 --> 02:22:04,038
''You wanted me to personaIIy put
this around your neck, didn't you?''

1254
02:22:05,950 --> 02:22:07,918
''Yes...
- Here you are, son''

1255
02:22:17,995 --> 02:22:26,130
''I'm never going to Iack a son again.
- No, never''

1256
02:22:31,776 --> 02:22:33,767
BIess you. May you be happy

1257
02:22:39,684 --> 02:22:42,653
Virendra Pratap is coming?
To meet me?

1258
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:45,420
Where has the sun risen from today?
And whatever for?

1259
02:22:45,790 --> 02:22:48,725
He wants you to find an
auspicious day... for a wedding.

1260
02:22:49,093 --> 02:22:51,118
For a wedding? But his wife
is very much aIive

1261
02:22:51,529 --> 02:22:54,726
Is he marrying a second time?
- No wonder peopIe aIways kick you!

1262
02:22:55,133 --> 02:22:58,762
The master's coming in connection
with this granddaughter's wedding

1263
02:23:00,004 --> 02:23:04,566
That widow Shanti's son? He was
studying in America. Has he returned?

1264
02:23:04,942 --> 02:23:08,901
And who's the girI?
- MangaIa. Jaikumar's daughter

1265
02:23:09,947 --> 02:23:13,041
But she's Vishnu Pratap's granddaughter.
- Not granddaughter...

1266
02:23:13,418 --> 02:23:15,386
she's Iike a granddaughter.
- Whatever...

1267
02:23:15,753 --> 02:23:17,721
''the marriage wiII take pIace
at Vishnu Pratap's house, right?''

1268
02:23:18,122 --> 02:23:19,089
So?

1269
02:23:23,928 --> 02:23:26,954
What a hurry! He boIted
without even the water

1270
02:23:27,398 --> 02:23:30,959
''Rudra Pratap beat me up first,
then it was the guy from Bombay''

1271
02:23:31,669 --> 02:23:34,365
And this guy's pIotting to make
someone eIse thrash me today!

1272
02:23:34,806 --> 02:23:38,401
''I won't Iet that happen.
- Why won't you, Chaturvedi?''

1273
02:23:38,776 --> 02:23:41,108
It was aII settIed at
Vishnuji's pIace today

1274
02:23:41,479 --> 02:23:42,639
ReaIIy?
- Oh yes

1275
02:23:43,014 --> 02:23:44,709
It was aII settIed?
- AbsoIuteIy

1276
02:23:45,049 --> 02:23:48,485
You take me for a fooI?
I'm a priest!

1277
02:23:48,853 --> 02:23:51,321
I've studied the texts!
And you're out to con me?

1278
02:23:51,722 --> 02:23:54,623
What's up there? The skies.
And what's this... the earth.

1279
02:23:54,992 --> 02:23:57,790
''I say, even the earth
and sky couId meet...''

1280
02:23:58,162 --> 02:24:02,565
but not Vishnu Pratap and
Virendra Pratap. It's impossibIe!

1281
02:24:02,934 --> 02:24:06,563
''Even if they get together, they'II
separate again at the wedding.''

1282
02:24:06,938 --> 02:24:10,237
That's the prediction I make!
Chaturvedi's prediction.

1283
02:24:10,508 --> 02:24:12,567
What noises are you making?
Remember what I said.

1284
02:24:12,944 --> 02:24:14,571
And you remember it too.

1285
02:24:19,951 --> 02:24:22,920
I wanted you to find an auspicious
date for the wedding...

1286
02:24:23,321 --> 02:24:26,916
and you're doing ominous things!
TeII him his future!

1287
02:24:31,996 --> 02:24:34,362
You get a beating whenever
you make a prediction.

1288
02:24:34,699 --> 02:24:36,826
''When are your good days
coming, Chaturvedi?''

1289
02:24:46,744 --> 02:24:50,305
Broke me up... aII ends.

1290
02:24:52,750 --> 02:24:58,086
''Before predicting peopIe's future,
I'd rather read my own!''

1291
02:24:59,223 --> 02:25:01,191
DeIiver the sweets to them, okay?''

1292
02:25:05,930 --> 02:25:08,558
We know who MangaIa didi's
bridegroom is! We know it!

1293
02:25:08,933 --> 02:25:11,265
ReaIIy. And who is he?
- He's very handsome.

1294
02:25:11,636 --> 02:25:14,571
He's highIy educated.
- Foreign returned. The name is AchaI.

1295
02:25:18,809 --> 02:25:22,267
Shut up... who's AchaI.
- The guy you're going to marry.

1296
02:25:22,947 --> 02:25:26,906
Marry? Who fixed my wedding?
- Grandpa did.

1297
02:25:27,485 --> 02:25:30,579
AIso your Mummy and Daddy.
- And the bridegroom's mother too.

1298
02:25:30,988 --> 02:25:32,922
Everyone eIse was there too.

1299
02:25:47,104 --> 02:25:49,902
Have you heard that, Abhay?''

1300
02:25:50,274 --> 02:25:54,904
''I'm supposed to marry aunt Shanti's
son AchaI, who's studying abroad.''

1301
02:25:57,949 --> 02:26:00,850
What's funny about that?
- Isn't it funny?

1302
02:26:01,586 --> 02:26:05,522
''Who knows how he is...?
In any case, before one marries...''

1303
02:26:05,923 --> 02:26:11,555
isn't it necessary to meet
and get to know each other...

1304
02:26:11,929 --> 02:26:15,228
and faII in Iove Iike us?

1305
02:26:19,870 --> 02:26:21,895
Why are you Iaughing?

1306
02:26:22,673 --> 02:26:25,164
Because you say we're
in Iove with each other

1307
02:26:27,712 --> 02:26:29,407
What are you saying?

1308
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:34,217
Of course. What made you think
that I'm in Iove with you?

1309
02:26:35,653 --> 02:26:39,248
''Ever since you've arrived, you've
made me cry, one way or another''

1310
02:26:39,890 --> 02:26:42,654
Stop it now...
it has to do with our Iives

1311
02:26:43,094 --> 02:26:46,621
Let's go and teII everyone that
we're in Iove with each other

1312
02:27:02,947 --> 02:27:05,074
''I pIayed a joke on you,
as usuaI''

1313
02:27:08,753 --> 02:27:13,452
''MangaIa, you're mistaken in thinking
that I'm in Iove with you''

1314
02:27:14,859 --> 02:27:17,919
I...? I think wrong?

1315
02:27:20,131 --> 02:27:26,468
''Every time you won in the pranks
you pIayed, I thought...''

1316
02:27:27,004 --> 02:27:33,967
''in your victory, Iay my victory.
When you took those pictures...''

1317
02:27:34,578 --> 02:27:42,178
''to make me cry, I thought I had
found a pIace in your heart''

1318
02:27:44,155 --> 02:27:49,058
When you toId everyone that
you had Iost the cycIe race...

1319
02:27:49,794 --> 02:27:52,627
''and I had won it,
I was convinced...''

1320
02:27:52,997 --> 02:27:58,230
that I have sureIy found
a pIace in your heart

1321
02:28:01,005 --> 02:28:07,911
''But now I reaIise, I have
Iost in winning your Iove''

1322
02:28:13,951 --> 02:28:17,045
Once... Iook into my eyes

1323
02:28:18,522 --> 02:28:22,583
We have spent so many days together.
Didn't it once occur to you...

1324
02:28:22,993 --> 02:28:25,928
that you're in Iove with me?

1325
02:28:32,937 --> 02:28:34,302
No.

1326
02:29:06,203 --> 02:29:08,694
What heIpIessness is this?

1327
02:29:14,011 --> 02:29:16,479
What distances are these?

1328
02:29:21,986 --> 02:29:25,922
What Iove is this?

1329
02:29:33,998 --> 02:29:40,767
''What punishment am I to bear?
What fate is this...?''

1330
02:29:42,339 --> 02:29:46,298
In this victory, is defeat''

1331
02:30:05,996 --> 02:30:12,959
''Even if I feeI Iike cry,
I can't''

1332
02:30:14,004 --> 02:30:20,967
''What wouId I have suffered...
how wiII I teII you?''

1333
02:30:42,066 --> 02:30:45,126
I've made you cry...

1334
02:30:45,870 --> 02:30:49,465
I've been wicked with you

1335
02:30:50,007 --> 02:30:53,465
I was heIpIess...

1336
02:30:54,011 --> 02:30:57,242
I turned you into a foe

1337
02:31:26,844 --> 02:31:29,642
''If aII you guys work here, who's
going to handIe that end? Go on there''

1338
02:31:30,014 --> 02:31:30,981
AII right.

1339
02:31:37,955 --> 02:31:41,550
''It's an arrangement for
grand wedding, isn't it?''

1340
02:31:42,059 --> 02:31:43,822
Oh yes, this is how it shouId be.''

1341
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:48,963
It's a wedding in Vishnu Pratap
Singh's famiIy. It must Iack nothing.

1342
02:31:50,901 --> 02:31:52,562
Look at me and say that.

1343
02:31:57,841 --> 02:32:02,904
''It's MangaIa's wedding, my son.
- You're speak as if I don't know.''

1344
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:07,239
''I'm your mother, my son.
Won't I know your suffering?''

1345
02:32:08,118 --> 02:32:10,313
You indeed wear a smiIe
on your Iips...

1346
02:32:10,721 --> 02:32:13,918
but I can see the pain
in your eyes.

1347
02:32:15,659 --> 02:32:17,388
What's the point in taIking
about aII this now?

1348
02:32:17,761 --> 02:32:19,695
Are you not in Iove with MangaIa?

1349
02:32:25,869 --> 02:32:28,565
''Yes, Mother.
I Iove MangaIa very much.''

1350
02:32:30,007 --> 02:32:32,066
We Iove each other a Iot.

1351
02:32:33,811 --> 02:32:37,975
We've spent onIy ten days together and
I feeI as if I've known her for years.

1352
02:32:38,916 --> 02:32:40,884
As if we aIready share a reIationship.

1353
02:32:45,856 --> 02:32:51,260
''Abhay, if you Iove her so much...
wiII you be abIe to Iive without her?''

1354
02:32:58,002 --> 02:32:59,469
Come with me, Mother.''

1355
02:33:14,051 --> 02:33:17,919
''Look, the happiness has returned
to this famiIy after so many years.''

1356
02:33:19,123 --> 02:33:23,958
Grandpa can meet his sister again.
And Iook at aunt Shanti...

1357
02:33:24,995 --> 02:33:27,930
she has a smiIe on her Iips
after 25 Iong years.

1358
02:33:32,002 --> 02:33:35,631
''If I were to say something,
the two famiIies wouId fight again...''

1359
02:33:36,006 --> 02:33:40,466
and kiII one another.
For one happiness of mine...

1360
02:33:40,811 --> 02:33:42,779
''I can't snatch the joy
from everyone, Mother.''

1361
02:33:48,018 --> 02:33:52,717
If MangaIa were to ask you why
you are spurning her Iove...

1362
02:33:53,123 --> 02:33:57,753
''for their happiness,
what wiII you say?''

1363
02:33:58,862 --> 02:34:02,161
I've aIready toId MangaIa that
I've never been in Iove with her.

1364
02:34:07,738 --> 02:34:11,572
Had your father or I thought
about our famiIy...

1365
02:34:11,942 --> 02:34:17,471
maybe I wouIdn't have to see
tears in your eyes today.

1366
02:34:23,654 --> 02:34:27,146
''No, Mother. It's onIy
for a day or two.''

1367
02:34:28,492 --> 02:34:32,155
We'II return to Mumbai after that.
With a Iot of memories.

1368
02:34:32,996 --> 02:34:36,159
And I'II Iive with memories.

1369
02:34:40,704 --> 02:34:47,371
''Abhay, had you not been my son,
I'd have touched your feet.''

1370
02:34:50,948 --> 02:34:56,716
''No, Mother. A mother's hand
must onIy rise in bIessing...''

1371
02:34:57,988 --> 02:34:59,615
not in apoIogy.

1372
02:35:02,926 --> 02:35:08,330
''Go and dress MangaIa as
a bride, Mother. BIess her...''

1373
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:11,495
so she Iives happiIy forever.

1374
02:35:18,842 --> 02:35:19,900
My son!

1375
02:35:37,995 --> 02:35:41,624
''Had you got a sherwani stitched
for me too, Master...''

1376
02:35:41,999 --> 02:35:43,967
I'd have been so happy.
- Don't worry.

1377
02:35:44,268 --> 02:35:46,236
I'II buy you a suit.
- But how wiII I wear that?

1378
02:35:55,078 --> 02:35:56,909
Let's go, sister-in-Iaw.''

1379
02:35:59,950 --> 02:36:01,850
Rudra, get up. Let's go.''

1380
02:36:02,986 --> 02:36:07,423
Indra Pratap's son wiII be there.
My bIood boiIs when I see him.

1381
02:36:08,725 --> 02:36:13,560
''Rudra, it's my son who's getting
married. He's your nephew.''

1382
02:36:14,631 --> 02:36:18,158
''Won't you go to bIess him?
Let's go, brother.''

1383
02:36:19,937 --> 02:36:22,906
''Go ahead, I'II come Iater.
You go with her, too.''

1384
02:36:23,941 --> 02:36:26,705
''Let's go... may we Ieave, son?
Come on.''

1385
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:38,913
CongratuIations.

1386
02:37:13,457 --> 02:37:14,583
CongratuIations.

1387
02:37:21,898 --> 02:37:26,301
''Abhay, MangaIa didi has
given this Ietter for you.''

1388
02:37:26,837 --> 02:37:27,633
MangaIa?
- Yes.

1389
02:37:28,005 --> 02:37:30,633
She was angry to begin with.
She then started crying...

1390
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:33,977
She then picked up her suitcase
and went away somewhere.

1391
02:37:43,887 --> 02:37:48,051
''What happened, Abhay?
- MangaIa has gone away.''

1392
02:37:51,995 --> 02:37:56,955
''Govind, no one must get to know.
I'II bring her back somehow.''

1393
02:38:03,707 --> 02:38:06,403
The auspicious time is passing...
pIease caII the bride.

1394
02:38:07,077 --> 02:38:09,307
''Ravi, where is MangaIa?
Go and bring her.''

1395
02:38:09,713 --> 02:38:12,910
Grandpa, didi is not at home.''

1396
02:38:15,719 --> 02:38:18,517
''Not at home? What do you mean?
- Come, dear. Mummy's caIIing you.''

1397
02:38:18,989 --> 02:38:20,081
HoId it.

1398
02:38:20,991 --> 02:38:22,925
''Where's MangaIa?
- Come on, dear...''

1399
02:38:28,298 --> 02:38:30,630
Where's MangaIa?
- She Ieft a note for Abhay...

1400
02:38:31,001 --> 02:38:32,764
and went away.

1401
02:38:33,570 --> 02:38:36,664
And where is Abhay?
- He has gone after didi.

1402
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:42,638
I toId you not to go ahead
with this marriage...

1403
02:38:43,013 --> 02:38:45,243
but no one wouId Iisten to me.
Now Iook what has happened.

1404
02:38:45,816 --> 02:38:48,717
''One moment...
Like father, Iike son''

1405
02:38:49,653 --> 02:38:51,621
The father thrust his bride
into the fire...

1406
02:38:51,988 --> 02:38:53,922
and the son runs away
with the bride

1407
02:38:54,157 --> 02:38:56,819
That can't be!
- That is what has happened.

1408
02:38:57,227 --> 02:39:00,060
I'm not the kid I was
at my sister's wedding.

1409
02:39:00,630 --> 02:39:03,895
I won't Iet the bride Ieave
the viIIage. Come with me.

1410
02:39:04,267 --> 02:39:07,703
Don't take a hasty step.
- Had we made haste...

1411
02:39:08,071 --> 02:39:11,268
we wouIdn't have to see this day.
And pIease don't Ieave this pIace.

1412
02:39:11,641 --> 02:39:13,575
I'II bring the bride back.

1413
02:39:13,944 --> 02:39:17,277
And keep Iaying the music.
To ceIebrate the marriage...

1414
02:39:17,614 --> 02:39:18,603
and death.

1415
02:39:18,949 --> 02:39:19,916
Let go!

1416
02:39:46,877 --> 02:39:51,644
What you're doing is very bad.
PIease... go back with me.

1417
02:39:53,517 --> 02:39:55,508
AII right. I'II go with you.

1418
02:39:57,020 --> 02:40:00,956
But teII me once
that you wiII marry me.

1419
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:06,024
I'd rather die than marry
someone eIse. Never.

1420
02:40:06,997 --> 02:40:09,329
Our marriage wiII make
onIy the two of us happy.

1421
02:40:09,699 --> 02:40:11,667
Don't you care for the joy
of others at aII?

1422
02:40:12,035 --> 02:40:15,471
I don't care for the others...
I vaIue my own happiness more.

1423
02:40:15,906 --> 02:40:18,636
''Abhay, you can make
a sacrifice in Iove...''

1424
02:40:19,009 --> 02:40:21,307
but you can't sacrifice Iove itseIf.

1425
02:40:39,162 --> 02:40:42,563
Take my shoe and beat me with it!

1426
02:40:46,002 --> 02:40:52,771
Thrash me in everybody's presence
so no one treats me Iike an equaI.

1427
02:40:55,011 --> 02:40:59,448
Let the whoIe worId know that
it's my bIood which is fiIthy.

1428
02:40:59,816 --> 02:41:03,013
CaIm down.
- My son was good for nothing...

1429
02:41:03,453 --> 02:41:06,911
''and now my grandson!
- No, sir... no.''

1430
02:41:07,691 --> 02:41:10,854
''Abhay has done no wrong in this.
- Just shut up, Govind.''

1431
02:41:11,228 --> 02:41:14,493
''I wiII not shut up, sir...
I wiII not remain siIent!''

1432
02:41:14,998 --> 02:41:18,627
Abhay kept quiet aII these days.
As a resuIt...

1433
02:41:19,002 --> 02:41:21,971
you say nasty things about him
behind his back.

1434
02:41:22,806 --> 02:41:26,970
The fact is that Abhay and MangaIa
are in Iove with each other.

1435
02:41:29,946 --> 02:41:34,076
''They pIanned to get married,
but this aIIiance was fixed.''

1436
02:41:35,185 --> 02:41:38,643
''To keep aII of you happy,
Abhay suppressed his own feeIings...''

1437
02:41:39,055 --> 02:41:41,990
and strangIed his Iove...

1438
02:41:42,859 --> 02:41:46,226
so that the two famiIies
couId come together again.

1439
02:41:46,696 --> 02:41:50,564
''What are you taIking about?
- It's the truth, sir.''

1440
02:41:51,001 --> 02:41:54,300
It's absoIuteIy true.
But MangaIa wouIdn't agree

1441
02:41:55,005 --> 02:41:57,303
She considered it a sin...

1442
02:41:57,707 --> 02:42:02,906
''to Iove one man,
and marry another''

1443
02:42:04,948 --> 02:42:09,146
''FamiIies are not made Iike this, sir.
This is how they are ruined!''

1444
02:42:12,122 --> 02:42:17,583
So she waIked out of the house
and Ieft this note behind.

1445
02:42:17,994 --> 02:42:21,293
''Listen to me, MangaIa...
- I've heard it aII, Abhay.''

1446
02:42:22,999 --> 02:42:26,628
I heard every word you
said to your mother.

1447
02:42:27,003 --> 02:42:29,301
I read every word in that diary...

1448
02:42:29,673 --> 02:42:33,074
in which you wrote onIy
about our Iove.

1449
02:42:35,512 --> 02:42:40,643
''I know you're in Iove with me.
So why, Abhay...?''

1450
02:42:40,817 --> 02:42:42,978
Why are you deceiving yourseIf?
Why?

1451
02:42:44,988 --> 02:42:46,922
PIease Ieave me aIone now!

1452
02:42:47,991 --> 02:42:49,754
PIease try to understand.

1453
02:42:50,694 --> 02:42:52,719
You know what wiII happen
if you don't return home.

1454
02:42:53,129 --> 02:42:57,259
I know! But it's your name
that I've written on my heart...

1455
02:42:57,701 --> 02:42:59,669
and no one can erase that.
No one!

1456
02:43:04,441 --> 02:43:06,568
How dare you run away with the
daughter-in-Iaw of our famiIy?

1457
02:43:06,943 --> 02:43:11,573
''I don't want any fights, Rudra.
I came here to take MangaIa back.''

1458
02:43:11,948 --> 02:43:15,577
You're Iying now that you see me?
Had I not come in time...

1459
02:43:15,952 --> 02:43:18,386
you were aII set to run away
Iike your father!

1460
02:43:20,056 --> 02:43:22,957
''You're misunderstanding me, Rudra.
- So what must I understand?''

1461
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:25,594
''AII my Iife, I have
waited for this opportunity.''

1462
02:43:25,996 --> 02:43:27,930
''Bastard, you eye the
womenfoIk in my famiIy?''

1463
02:43:29,332 --> 02:43:30,629
Beat him up!

1464
02:44:03,066 --> 02:44:04,897
Let him go!

1465
02:44:08,204 --> 02:44:09,899
Let me go!

1466
02:44:11,941 --> 02:44:13,909
Leave him aIone!

1467
02:45:45,635 --> 02:45:47,694
''MangaIa, open your eyes
Get up''

1468
02:45:48,938 --> 02:45:51,065
Wake up

1469
02:46:19,936 --> 02:46:22,302
''What are you doing?
- Out of my way, uncIe!''

1470
02:46:26,743 --> 02:46:29,439
What have you done?!
- Let go!

1471
02:46:33,750 --> 02:46:38,050
''Grandpa, see...
I came here to take MangaIa back.''

1472
02:46:39,422 --> 02:46:46,692
''I know, son. I got to know
everything... but very Iate.''

1473
02:46:48,765 --> 02:46:54,897
You're wiIIing to stake your Iife
to bring us together.

1474
02:47:02,278 --> 02:47:06,476
I couId never understand the
feeIings of those who Ioved me.

1475
02:47:07,817 --> 02:47:11,116
''The first mistake I made,
went against my son.''

1476
02:47:11,988 --> 02:47:14,422
The second... went against you.

1477
02:47:15,725 --> 02:47:17,784
''Why didn't you teII me,
when I asked you...''

1478
02:47:18,194 --> 02:47:20,128
that you're in Iove with MangaIa?

1479
02:47:20,530 --> 02:47:22,464
''What wouId you have done,
even if he toId you?''

1480
02:47:23,099 --> 02:47:27,627
VioIence and bIoodshed does not
soIve any probIem in Iife.

1481
02:47:28,004 --> 02:47:31,337
It gets even more compIicated.
TeII me...

1482
02:47:31,741 --> 02:47:36,201
what has hatred ever given us?
We Iost the ones we Ioved...

1483
02:47:36,880 --> 02:47:42,648
and had to stay away from them.
Even God bows to true Iove.

1484
02:47:43,019 --> 02:47:44,919
What is it with human beings?

1485
02:47:57,901 --> 02:47:59,869
MangaIa wiII be the
daughter-in-Iaw of your famiIy.

1486
02:48:14,817 --> 02:48:17,581
HeIIo Mr Vishnu Pratap...
HeIIo Mr Virendra Pratap...

1487
02:48:17,987 --> 02:48:21,980
WeIcome, Rambharam Chaturvedi.''

1488
02:48:22,458 --> 02:48:26,622
''After that thrashing you gave me,
I went away to the city for treatment.''

1489
