1
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,916
I am fine. How are you doing?

2
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,333
Your father isn't at home.

3
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,083
He is in the laboratory.

4
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,958
Don't talk much.

5
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,375
Did you read Ma's letter?

6
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,291
No.

7
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,708
I had left it on your table.

8
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,000
They have found a groom for Jonaki.

9
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,750
They want to bring him along.

10
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,833
They own jute mills,
and a movie theatre too.

11
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,250
She is too young now.

12
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,208
Young?

13
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,125
A nineteen-year-old girl is not young.

14
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:41,833
What happened?

15
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,958
My head...

16
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,250
You work a lot.
You should get adequate rest.

17
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,916
If you're tired too often,
your body can't function normally.

18
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,500
Will you leave for England
if your research is approved?

19
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,041
Hmm.

20
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,291
I won't go alone.

21
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:40,958
Do you give me your word?

22
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,000
I do.

23
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,125
What will people say
if you behave like this?

24
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,875
What will they say, hmm?

25
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,250
You are not a man.

26
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,291
You need to understand that.

27
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:37,708
Have you seen other girls behave this way?

28
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,250
No.

29
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,916
I do many things
to keep myself busy all day.

30
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,458
I do a lot of things.

31
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,625
You can at least learn them.

32
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:33,500
Your grandparents are coming.
I will go back to Calcutta with them.

33
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,625
You stay with your father,
and do whatever you feel like.

34
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,958
This is not the first time
I am telling you this.

35
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,416
If you meet that boy again...

36
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,791
you will face the consequences.

37
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,833
Never again.

38
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,833
Wear your clothes now.

39
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,166
Have you brought the cake?

40
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,375
Yes, I have.

41
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,333
Why is Jonaki not here?

42
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:14,625
Ma.

43
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:43,833
Only you can make him understand.

44
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:48,541
He does not listen to anyone, Ma.

45
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,416
He will have to.

46
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,750
This is an absurd situation.

47
00:34:57,333 --> 00:35:00,041
I can understand someone not eating meat.

48
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:05,083
But not eating plants
and vegetables...

49
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,583
is strange.

50
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:11,125
How will he remain healthy this way?

51
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:16,291
I try to compensate with other food.

52
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:21,666
You shouldn't indulge yourself in this.

53
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:31,916
Maybe I am...

54
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:38,333
but no one believes in him right now.

55
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:43,166
And if I stop believing in him,
it will destroy him completely.

56
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,833
Why? What about the organization
in the U.K.?

57
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,833
They have not replied as yet.

58
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:58,291
-Well, then do what you think is right.
-Hmm.

59
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,458
I have nothing to say.

60
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:05,166
Check if she is asleep.

61
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:36,125
Get rid of that now.

62
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:40,666
Hmm. Let's go.

63
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,875
Does it hurt?

64
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:09,708
A bit.

65
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:19,791
Let me see.

66
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:22,791
Oh, my God.

67
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,333
You have been running a fever.

68
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:31,916
Listen, this doesn't look good.

69
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:37,041
Please, let's go to Calcutta.

70
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:41,833
Get yourself examined by Dr. Sukumar.

71
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:46,708
I think itâ€™s high time.

72
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:48,416
Let's wait for a few more days.

73
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:01,791
See what has happened by postponing it.

74
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:06,833
Please.

75
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:14,000
Let's go to Calcutta once. You can
resume your research once you are back.

76
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:20,166
I will instruct the caretaker
not to touch any of your things.

77
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:24,416
Everything you leave will remain--

78
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,166
-I can't, Rita.
-Do as I say.

79
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,333
Is there a telegram for me?

80
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,416
No.

81
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:10,208
What's with that sad face?

82
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:15,250
Anything that you might need is here.

83
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,791
If you want to go around,

84
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,750
you can take the car.

85
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:26,625
The mill compound is big.

86
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:31,875
There is a recreation club.

87
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:34,750
A swimming pool.

88
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:38,750
Alongside is the river...

89
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:44,125
with a beautiful promenade.

90
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:46,666
You can go for a walk there.

91
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:52,666
I will be in my office all day long...

92
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:57,833
and I have a direct phone line.

93
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,416
If you really need to,

94
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,125
you can call.

95
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:30,708
Fire?

96
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,833
At the theatre?

97
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:35,541
Wait there. I'm coming right away.

98
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:46,583
-I don't even know how to console you--
-Let it be! Come to the point.

99
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:58,416
I think the two of you
should try again, Indrajeet.

100
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:00,708
No.

101
01:17:02,166 --> 01:17:03,125
Why?

102
01:17:05,416 --> 01:17:06,458
What's the use?

103
01:17:13,416 --> 01:17:17,333
It was a miscarriage.
It can happen to anyone.

104
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,833
Jonaki is very sick.

105
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:30,416
She needs you by her side.

106
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:34,458
There is nothing I can do about it.

107
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,125
Then leave her.

108
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:58,333
End this for good.

109
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:03,250
Not possible.

110
01:18:08,791 --> 01:18:10,458
Please leave now.

111
01:22:05,208 --> 01:22:07,083
There is no use crying now.

112
