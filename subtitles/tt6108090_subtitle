After winning the doctor later? -

1013
01:48:33,256 --> 01:48:41,026
The doctor said the hospital the morning after the night we stayed action

1014

1022
01:49:25,504 --> 01:49:31,516
You do not blame your mother Mqsrh, why are you apologizing?

1023
01:49:35,707 --> 01:49:44,533
Listen N did not want to tell her you know .. did you know?

1024
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:55,587

I talked to my daughter Shina Sad

1032
01:51:43,706 --> 01:51:45,264
There are several ways can you complain to the police

1033
01:51:45,888 --> 01:51:49,695
The help side, Shina Sad it is, I do not have your life ruined
