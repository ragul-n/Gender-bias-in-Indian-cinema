1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,542
23.976

2
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:29,041
"You and I..."

3
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:42,875
"Because I love you"

4
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,750
"Boys get together and go out
Girls get together and chat"

5
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:56,832
"How will we get together?"

6
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:02,583
"Deep in my heart, you and l"

7
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:20,125
"Day longs of longings
whenever you're nowhere near"

8
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:24,874
"Who all were you with?

9
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,791
"So if you love me?"

10
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:31,125
"Why didn't you profess your love
and you fought me off?"

11
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:36,625
"Now come into my arms"

12
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,832
First of all God created the world.

13
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,499
Then he went off to sleep over it...

14
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,999
and He conjured up
a guy and He was glad

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,665
So He wanted to dream on and on.

16
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,708
That's when He made
His biggest mistake

17
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,208
He created a Girl.

18
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,250
Which done, He lost his sleep.
So we lost our sleep too. For good

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,041
And the world was split
into two halves

20
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:19,583
girls and guys, like you and I

21
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:32,374
"So what do we do about
...you and I?"

22
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:37,292
Renowned cartoonist Karan Kapoor's
debut novel "Hum-Tum"...

23
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,374
is a national bestseller

24
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,625
First week sales crossed 10,000 copies

25
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:46,374
with orders of ten thousand more

26
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:51,375
Karan Kapoor joins the press
in a first look after this grand success

27
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,916
How does a cartoonist turn into author?

28
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:14,333
Tried cartoons, now I'm trying words,

29
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:17,249
hoping to understand
...women, someday

30
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,249
Come to grips with that understanding?

31
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,916
Hopefully, after a few more books

32
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:25,249
And you'll write only on women?

33
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,083
Anything better, more interesting?

34
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:31,083
Notwithstanding your
digs at girls... - Indeed...

35
00:03:31,084 --> 00:03:36,000
I think your novel is woven around...
your real life experience.

36
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:41,458
Look... when love is requited...
there's no story left to be told.

37
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:45,415
A failed romance isn't worth talking

38
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:49,415
And unrequited love...?

39
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,083
True love never goes unrequited

40
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:56,000
It's consummated, one day or another.
Because life's a long while

41
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:01,457
Many such romances in your life?

42
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,457
Only one object of romance.

43
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:08,208
But the romances
she sparked were many

44
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,624
Silence

45
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,958
Mamma, enough
- Rhea, stop it

46
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,124
My daughter is going abroad...

47
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,124
Who else in the family ever went?

48
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,124
Who else in our colony? Ever?

49
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,209
I've packed lots of snacks for you

50
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,832
Spiced grams, pickles, sweets

51
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:42,332
Eat almonds every day,
sharpens your brains

52
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:46,499
I'll miss you Mamma

53
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,250
I will also, child

54
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,332
Hey gorgeous

55
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,832
Karan, where have you been?

56
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,041
Something forgotten
back in the car? - Yes

57
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,541
Oh car keys

58
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,374
You see...
- Don't even start

59
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,707
I don't care whoever she was.

60
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,874
Who said I was with any girl?

61
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,041
You got the passport, tickets?

62
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:19,041
Mom I'm going to America. To study.

63
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:20,874
I think I can take care of myself

64
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,207
Rubbish

65
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,207
Hey brother

66
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,207
Don't hey brother me, okay?

67
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,707
I got your passport, tickets

68
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,707
What would I do without you Mihir?

69
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,041
Grow up, okay?

70
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:33,374
Sure, Karan grows up someday

71
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,874
Hear that?

72
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,374
Thank God Shalini is in New York.

73
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,249
She'll take care of you

74
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,415
Don't remind me.
- She's your girlfriend

75
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:44,000
So? Never take girls too seriously

76
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,582
Girls are like buses.

77
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:50,749
There's one every
two minutes, traffic permitting

78
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,333
I disapprove of your attitude
towards girls.

79
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,083
And I've told you that before Girls...

80
00:05:57,084 --> 00:06:01,582
Are mothers, sisters. I know
But not my sisters

81
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,582
You will learn to show respect to women.

82
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,582
Says who that I don't respect women?

83
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,249
I respect you, I respect Indira Gandhi

84
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,916
Mother Teresa, Mother India, Miss India

85
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,249
Sorry

86
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,042
Keep Him on your desk.

87
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,375
Lord Ganesha
Thank you for sparing me that melodrama

88
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,916
Look

89
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,249
One minute Rhea...

90
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,916
Mamma enough. I'm off
- Listen

91
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:29,415
I'll be late for my flight

92
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,415
I'll spank you
if you don't stop right there

93
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,916
Oblations from our Goddess of Succour.

94
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:37,582
Give it to the poor in America

95
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,916
Never argue, my child.

96
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:42,415
Do one good deed
then you'll deserve a good turn

97
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,290
My tigress. Bye, wish you
good luck.

98
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:50,124
Hoist those pants

99
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,958
Yes one minute

100
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,290
Your dad
- Your husband.

101
00:06:55,291 --> 00:07:00,875
I wish you'd
mention him with a smile

102
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,624
Yes, I got the passport

103
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,124
I was thinking, this time for a change

104
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:14,625
why not holiday with
me in New York?

105
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:28,250
The way he talked,
I think he misses you

106
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,332
In all these seven years,

107
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,999
did he care to call me up even once?

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,999
Better for you if you
stay out of this mess.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,999
Concentrate on your studies
- Yes, studies

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,165
Mihir, you'll take care of Ma?

111
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,666
Like you always take care of her?

112
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,666
You make nice-sounding parting shots

113
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,332
like take care of Ma etc... etc

114
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:56,583
Bye Karan.
- Take care

115
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,708
I hope he does fine

116
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:06,541
You're worrying about him?
I pity the girls out there

117
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:12,042
They don't know what's coming their way.

118
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,749
No hi out of the blue

119
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,541
I won't even glance at her.

120
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:46,791
Not even if she is eyeing me.

121
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,625
Praise the name of The Lord
Preserve the name of The Lord

122
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:53,458
Not one nice airhostess

123
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,916
you know beer-dinner-playing
hard to get was a waste of time

124
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:42,874
When it's too late to even say hi...

125
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,792
Then you ask for a magazine

126
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:56,207
Know what, for three hours we've been

127
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,708
only two inches from each other...

128
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:01,082
without knowing each other's names.

129
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,082
Why didn't you ask before?

130
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:07,875
Rhea Prakash

131
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:14,500
Karan Kapoor
You can call me Karoo

132
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:22,792
The makings of a highly
interesting acquaintance?

133
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,374
You and I

134
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:30,792
Not as in yourself and me

135
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,125
Let's make a guess. You're the tea type

136
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,459
Nice you avoid tea.
You know, tea types?

137
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,749
My mother prefers tea

138
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,416
Just what I was about to say. Tea types

139
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:59,333
are conservative mothers, grandmothers

140
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:07,042
Today's woman prefers coffee not tea

141
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:16,333
Hello... sleeping beauty... rise and shine

142
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:35,416
Our New York flight is six hours away

143
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,416
Airport squatting is boring.

144
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:40,249
Let's take a tour of Amsterdam

145
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,082
You got a visa. - How did you know?

146
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:47,041
I checked your passport.
- You rifled my bag?

147
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,124
You were asleep. I was bored.

148
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,124
So I thought how I'd kill some time

149
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,208
You don't open a lady's handbag.

150
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,624
Why what's inside a lady's handbag?

151
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:03,624
Okay I stand corrected.
I'd never do it again

152
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,208
I can't believe you rifled
my bag. - I said I'm sorry

153
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,958
Where are you headed? - I thought
we'd sight see Amsterdam

154
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,832
So where does our story end?
- Story? Ours?

155
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,999
Every one has a story.

156
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,083
So when we meet others, our stories meet

157
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,832
We'll spend lots of time together and

158
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,499
We'll look each other up in New York

159
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,417
Or we might say goodbyes
and never meet again

160
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,208
No matter how long or how short,
here's a tale of the two of us

161
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,832
Keep. Euro 1.40
- What was that?

162
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,584
My fare- Don't be silly.
Only 75 Rupees

163
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:02,541
Fifty-fifty.
Why must you spend on my tickets?

164
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:07,792
Yes, how are we related?

165
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:14,125
I was about to crack another bad joke

166
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,207
Here's where we are.

167
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:31,125
And there's where we're headed

168
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:36,792
Why do people smoke?

169
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:41,167
Unless you try how will you know?
It's amazing

170
00:14:56,083 --> 00:15:00,834
Why do people smoke?

171
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,082
I thought we're taking this tour together

172
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,249
Why do you guys
always walk ahead of girls?

173
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,625
Why are girls always a step behind?

174
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,417
We walk ahead to show the way

175
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,208
and we follow so we can support you

176
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,957
We decided not to see
boring museums.

177
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,291
When did we decide?

178
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:53,624
Okay, we're deciding now.

179
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,624
Museums are for kids, school
teachers and old people.

180
00:15:56,625 --> 00:16:01,291
I'm off

181
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:04,291
You'll leave me all alone?

182
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:07,458
You will leave a
girl all alone in Amsterdam?

183
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:12,624
How will I get to the airport on my own?

184
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:17,375
Fine. You go your way. I'll go mine.

185
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:40,083
Done with your museum?

186
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,166
God
- What have I done?

187
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:47,208
Why were
you staring at that girl?

188
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:52,875
Your x-ray eyes see
through dresses? - I wish

189
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:03,209
Karan how would you feel
if you were ogled at by a girl?

190
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:09,750
Thank God, not all guys think like you

191
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:15,334
Not all guys think like that?
You seriously think so?

192
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,209
You mean every guy is looking
for the same thing from a girl?

193
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,375
And what if he doesn't get it?
- We cover up with lies

194
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:30,917
Lies?

195
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,916
So what's your lie?

196
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:38,082
Your lies

197
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,334
When a girl smiles at me...

198
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,958
I tell my friends, look,
she gave me her telephone number

199
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:47,082
When she gives me her telephone number

200
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,749
I'll tell that I took her out

201
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,292
When I take her out,
I'll say that I held her hand

202
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,082
When she holds my hand, I'll say...

203
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,582
I kissed her

204
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:03,875
After I've kissed her,
I'll say...

205
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:12,000
And talking about us,
what lies will you tell your friends?

206
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,665
Why does she take
everything so seriously?

207
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:27,792
"You'll never figure why..."
"no girl's ever like a guy"

208
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:38,167
[Skipped item nr. 207]

209
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:51,917
"She thinks harder
but she knows lesser"

210
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:56,541
"Whatever her heart tells
she'll do quite something else"

211
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:06,958
"I'll never figure why
she isn't like a guy"

212
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:46,667
"There's romance lurking in her heart
but she wants you to make a start"

213
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:49,083
"And when she's rattled

214
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:51,916
It's her locks that she ruffled"

215
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:53,249
I mean you're all the same

216
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,291
We're nice friends,
I never thought of you that way

217
00:19:56,292 --> 00:20:02,375
Sounds fine, but it
never came to my mind

218
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:08,667
and soon nothing about
you is good enough"

219
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,791
What an awful shirt

220
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,457
What a haircut

221
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,083
Stop speeding

222
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:15,457
Stop hogging

223
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,415
Give me a break

224
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,833
"Up close she wants to change your life

225
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:25,833
the spell she casts can ruin your life"

226
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:30,708
"You'll fall for her words
then you'll know why..."

227
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:35,209
"what started with
a laugh ends in a cry"

228
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:46,084
"And you'll never figure why
she's so unlike a guy"

229
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,917
"If happiness is being alone
what makes you such a flirt?"

230
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:25,042
"The thousand gifts you shower on her
for what were all those flowers?"

231
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,457
You didn't tell me your name

232
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,874
How about a coffee?

233
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,249
Can I drop you home?

234
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,749
When do I get to see you next?

235
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,042
"It's a wayward life you've
lived living like a tramp"

236
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:42,084
"But you'll insist you're different
why are you so vain?"

237
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,415
That wet towel on the floor

238
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,083
Cap of the toothpaste tube missing

239
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:48,083
Wear used socks inside out

240
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:49,958
Never knows how time flies?

241
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:54,416
"How to live a life, she shows you"

242
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:59,291
"She makes something human out of you"

243
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:08,708
"And she knows what
you can't tell her"

244
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:19,291
"That's just why no girl's are like a guy"

245
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:29,000
"All sorts of strange dates
she'll always call to mind"

246
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:33,917
"Love can be forgotten
but forgetting a date is crime"

247
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:37,875
On 1st March, we looked at each other.
4th April, I went to meet you

248
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,124
May 21. You touched me

249
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,874
June 6. I felt something stirring

250
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:46,250
"Can't trust a guy,
these guys are so fast"

251
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,375
"Now he's here, now he's gone
no telling how long he'll last"

252
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:54,958
Your Mummy-Daddy aren't at home?
Great! Can I come over?

253
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:58,208
Your friend is going home alone.
Poor thing, shall I escort her?

254
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:03,708
"She'll lead you up the street
before she says yes"

255
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:08,708
"She's enjoying herself
while you're getting harassed"

256
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:13,750
"She's shy, that's why"

257
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,084
"But if she said yes ever
she's is avowed forever"

258
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:35,792
"That's just why a girl's
different from a guy"

259
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:38,999
Someone, shut her up

260
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,416
All right, what's the quarrel?

261
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:44,290
"Like a bee he comes singing his song

262
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,249
then he's busy,
I got the timing wrong"

263
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:46,958
Oh come on Rhea

264
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,582
"Please, I'm busy or I'd never..."
- Do I have a say?

265
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,249
"So what, you'll live
in my heart forever"

266
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,041
"The beauty he fell for
once is now so boring..."

267
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:57,666
"and before you know it,
his eyes have begun philandering"

268
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:01,583
You can't live on love and fresh air.
Why not take up interior decoration?

269
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:53,208
I kissed you. You slapped me.
Scores settled?

270
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:59,457
Now you're going to listen

271
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:03,041
I thought you're a nice guy,
only a little stupid

272
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,624
And you got me all wrong

273
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:09,416
Because it was I who broke the ice
on the plane? Because...

274
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:12,542
I went out with you in Amsterdam,
tried puffing a cigarette...

275
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:15,582
you thought I was all laid out for you?

276
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:19,542
How true. Guys like you expect
only one thing from any girl

277
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,499
Such strange notions

278
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,708
You wanted to know?

279
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:30,041
How our story ends?
There's no story about us

280
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:36,625
There's only "The End"
and this is the end

281
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:46,250
Life's a long while

282
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,709
You and I... unlike other
guys and girls we won't fight

283
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,124
Stop whistling. It's not nice

284
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,916
I'm not whistling at a girl

285
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:17,957
You go whistling after girls?

286
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:21,542
You go whistling at girls
and you say I'm sick?

287
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:27,709
I never whistled at anyone
and I didn't say I wouldn't fight

288
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:33,457
No point telling the
truth to girls- Meaning?

289
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,958
For example, in that dress
you don't look fat

290
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:40,124
I look fat in this dress?

291
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,332
I don't look fat for the dress.

292
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:45,499
It's the pink.
Pink makes me look fat

293
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,709
Neither you nor your
dress is to blame.

294
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,332
Pink takes the blame

295
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:52,833
Oh God

296
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:58,250
I'm serious. I look slim in blue

297
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,165
I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

298
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:32,833
Where am I going... hot dog

299
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:38,416
One for me. - Okay

300
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,915
I knew! It's... you

301
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:56,917
I knew too. I'm avoiding you

302
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:02,708
You're still angry?
Rhea, I was only...

303
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:05,791
You transpired. It's bound to happen.
- Forget it. Now we meet...

304
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:09,040
after 6 months in New York.
Like I told you...

305
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:13,458
between us, there's a story.
- And what about your other story?

306
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:16,708
Which story?
- The one behind the tree...

307
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:20,708
in which you were doing whatever...
- Who me...? No man...

308
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:23,249
Rhea...? - Shalini

309
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,500
Rhea! In New York?
- Yes, studying fashion designing

310
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,416
And you...?
- Columbia University

311
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:33,416
Rhea have you met my boyfriend?

312
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:36,500
Karan is your boyfriend?
- Yes. Ever since college. In Delhi

313
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,416
Rhea and I were classmates in school.

314
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:42,999
Your friend from school? That's nice

315
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,583
We never saw each other
after we went to college

316
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:47,749
How do you know each other?

317
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:52,249
Karan. He's your boyfriend

318
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,332
Rhea is your friend from school

319
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:59,250
If one of you isn't telling
How you met up, I'll scream. Right now

320
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,249
No baby, no

321
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,082
Excuse me
- Come darling, I'll tell you

322
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,875
When we met in Amsterdam...
Shalini was still your girlfriend?

323
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:12,583
You went to Amsterdam?

324
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,915
Come, I'll tell you everything

325
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:21,375
Shalini, I'll tell you
how we met up in Amsterdam

326
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:25,749
I got some work. I'll see you.
- What work...?

327
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,750
I'll tell you when I remember
Come here

328
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,375
He's a real jerk. I swear!
He actually kissed me. I slapped him

329
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:30,625
Behind every successful
man there's a woman

330
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:32,207
Of course

331
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:38,458
That's because girls never
run after guys who don't succeed

332
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:56,334
You must rig the tent in four days

333
00:30:56,584 --> 00:31:00,167
Mr. Mishra, we've organized
so many weddings together...

334
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:03,833
I've given you so much business.
And now in the eleventh hour...

335
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:08,416
no, you must do something. Please

336
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:12,249
Assurances and assurances.
Nothing ever seems to happen

337
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,500
Why are you staring at me?
Get on with your jobs

338
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:23,583
Nothing for breakfast?

339
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:28,125
I only got to ask for breakfast
and you break into tears?

340
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:31,708
The tent isn't up.
Mr. Sharma's wife is in labor

341
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:36,542
And even that cow is sick!!!
Why haven't you taken a haircut?

342
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,082
This is my Tom Cruise look
- Tom Cruise look!

343
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:46,708
I told you, stop organizing weddings.
- Karan, please leave me alone

344
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:50,542
I'll make myself breakfast.
You want anything?

345
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,666
Karan, what are you doing next week?
- Next week?

346
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:01,042
I don't know about today and
you ask me about a week ahead

347
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:06,875
I've never planned so long ahead

348
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:12,124
Because you're going to
help me out with this wedding

349
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:17,583
I'm supposed to organize weddings?
- I'm not asking. I'm ordering you

350
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:21,208
No way! I can't do all this,
I won't get into all this

351
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,083
Sahib, what goes in between?
White flowers? Greens or marigolds?

352
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,582
What do you feel?
- Marigolds could be better

353
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,917
I used marigolds for my wedding.
- Then go ahead, why ask me?

354
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,083
Not Oye. My name is Jhallo Ram.
- Take your basket away

355
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:57,790
Susie, don't believe Natasha

356
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:01,041
She and I are just friends.
Nothing happened between us

357
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:06,791
I don't care. I just called to say
that boss has cancelled your leave

358
00:33:07,042 --> 00:33:10,625
If you don't report for
work today you're fired

359
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:11,874
Let him do that

360
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,958
He was very serious
- Even I'm very serious

361
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:17,041
The Times of India has made an offer.

362
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:19,540
They'll carry my Hum-Tum cartoons daily

363
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:23,791
And the money is nice.
So who cares for this nine-to-fiver?

364
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:27,416
Right Tuka Ram?
- No. Jhallo Ram

365
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:29,832
The bride's people have arrived

366
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,916
Susie, the bride's people have arrived

367
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:35,167
Suji... the stuff for making
sweets? (Suji: Semolina)

368
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:39,082
Jhallo Ram. Unload the stuff

369
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:43,500
Where is the electricity generator?
Nothing's on time if I'm not around

370
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,334
Remove that basket

371
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:52,957
Nice venue for a wedding

372
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:58,500
A wedding villa is a fun place.
How far away is your bridegroom?

373
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:05,083
Hum-Tum! I always browse the strip
in the Sunday Times of India

374
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:14,209
My Hum-Tum is so popular among girls?
- Yours? Hum-Tum are very cute

375
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:20,875
Right. You and I are cute

376
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,791
Damn tent

377
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:44,875
Something awful always happens
whenever I see you

378
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:51,209
Whatever happened to your hair?
- It's my Tom Cruise look

379
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:54,708
You won't understand.
Not your level. This is fashion

380
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:00,291
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

381
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:04,832
I'm in charge of wedding plans here

382
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:08,708
That's obvious. - Actually
it's my Ma. I'm helping her

383
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:12,541
That's so sweet. - Right? See, so sweet

384
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:16,583
What are you doing here?
- You're organizing the wedding?

385
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:20,917
And you don't know
who the bride is? - Who...?

386
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,999
You're marrying so late?

387
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,584
You could've mothered three
kids by now. Have you?

388
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:37,250
3 years on, I thought my slap
would've mended your mind

389
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,208
Some guys never change

390
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:43,957
My bags are inside the car.
Have them delivered to my room

391
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:49,792
You think I'm a porter? - Likewise

392
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:01,958
What's up? - How many kilos of candies?

393
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:05,792
Who wants candies?
I hate them. Who asked for it?

394
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:07,874
The bride's mother.
- Who chooses sweets for the wedding?

395
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:11,958
The bride's mother? Or I...?
- You're the boss

396
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,292
Get ten kilos of pastries. - Done

397
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:18,249
Greetings. - Greetings

398
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:23,833
I'm the bride's mother. Sorry, you
should've said you hate candies

399
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:25,415
I'd never have asked for those

400
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,249
Aunty, I was only...

401
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,667
Aunty? How can you call me aunty?

402
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:33,083
Jhallo Ram where are you going?
- To buy your pastries

403
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:35,916
I was just joking. What did
the bride's mother ask for?

404
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:38,083
Candies. - Then candy it is

405
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:40,582
Buy 10 kilos. No, 15 kilos

406
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:41,916
5 kilos from my side

407
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:43,415
Many thanks

408
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:45,582
You're Anju's son? - Yes Aunty

409
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,916
What's this cursed Aunty-Aunty?

410
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:51,000
In our times, we married early
we had our babies fast

411
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:53,749
If you insist...

412
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,249
you can add a Bobby with Aunty.

413
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,749
The name's Mrs. Parminder Prakash

414
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,875
But everyone calls me Bobby
Aunty. It is my pet name

415
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,582
If I may say so,

416
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:06,415
you're as beautiful as the
legendary danseuse Umrao Jaan

417
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:10,209
I've been noticing you all along.
Your poise, your grace...

418
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:12,749
today's girls have none of it.
Now take your daughter

419
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,875
Son... even I've been
noticing you all day,

420
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:22,209
striding like a tiger... showing off your
stripes to the girls. - Not I...

421
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,457
Come off it. Wish you good luck

422
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:26,124
Please... - Karan...

423
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:28,958
Yes Bobby Aunty...? - Shut up

424
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:33,958
"Shut up" is a family trait...

425
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,290
Not Priya. Pooja

426
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:40,375
I think Priya suits you more.
Can I call you Priya?

427
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,124
Find a car for me

428
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:52,209
Your friends and family
just hijacked all the cars

429
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,832
And my designer wants me to try out
my wedding gown right now

430
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,332
Get me a cab

431
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,832
Here's a village.

432
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:04,250
You won't spot a cab
in a 12 mile radius

433
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:09,332
There's a way

434
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:13,832
Why aren't you attending the ritual?

435
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:19,166
You aren't supposed to meet your fiancé
two days before the wedding

436
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:22,416
Is it an arranged match? Or love?

437
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:38,959
What do you mean? - Sameer and
I went to college together

438
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:45,459
He proposed

439
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:48,959
He's smart, sensitive,
successful, mature...

440
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:52,792
unlike you. Find-my-towel-type.
- What's find-my-towel-type?

441
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,207
Like someone who'd scream
from the bathroom...

442
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,959
"Where's my towel, my shoes
...where's the newspaper?"

443
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:03,458
"Just peas and potatoes?"
In short, find-my-towel-type

444
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,749
You expect your Sameer

445
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:11,000
won't ask you to find
his towel after the wedding?

446
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:17,667
In New York you lived with Sameer?
- Before my wedding? Are you mad?

447
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:21,333
Don't tell me you never...?
- What...?

448
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,000
Why should I tell you that?
- That means no. I knew it

449
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:45,875
Rhea, Pooja said your Sameer
is some computer engineer

450
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,749
Sounds quite serious and quite boring

451
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,708
Being a computer engineer doesnt
make him serious and boring

452
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:57,542
Unlike you, he isn't an immature fool

453
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:01,083
Had I been more mature,
you would've considered me...?

454
00:40:01,084 --> 00:40:05,208
Shut up Karan. I'm getting married
in two days. You're sick

455
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:10,250
Did I ask you to marry me?
She takes everything so seriously

456
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:16,542
I don't see your husband.
He's in the catering business?

457
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,457
You're in the weddings' business,
he's in the catering business...?

458
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,917
Wonderful! Wish you good luck.
- No, he's a photographer

459
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,791
Even better! He's going
to shoot the wedding photos?

460
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:29,042
No, he's a fashion photographer.
Besides he doesn't live in India

461
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:33,542
In fact, we've separated. - So what?

462
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:40,375
I've separated from my husband too.
It was a matter of life and death

463
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:44,708
Bobby, you're a wonderful
example of perseverance

464
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,750
Somewhat true. But Anju,
you've got it going for you

465
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,833
You run a thriving wedding business.

466
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:52,165
And all you have is one son

467
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,666
You haven't a worry in life

468
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:56,917
Of course I worry. Mention marriage
and Karan runs scared

469
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:58,999
Why...?

470
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,833
Marriage is the end of
love and romance

471
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,083
Taking a potshot at marriage?
Does he know what love and romance is?

472
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,999
What would she know?
She's getting hitched

473
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,833
You tell me, did Adam
and Eve marry? - No...

474
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:14,750
They didn't and they basked
in their un-marital bliss

475
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:19,374
Look at legends. Romeo and Juliet.
Did they marry?

476
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:20,541
No. - They didn't

477
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:22,374
Did Her marry Ranjha? - No

478
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:25,040
Did Shirin and Farhad marry? - No

479
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,374
Ever wondered why? - Why...?

480
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,374
I'll tell you why.

481
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:31,374
Marriage would've
spelled doom for their romance

482
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:34,374
They could never have
become legendary lovers

483
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:37,625
So I tell you, if you wish
to find true love, never marry

484
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,541
Fall in love, like me

485
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:41,207
What rubbish

486
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,541
Nonsense

487
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:46,959
Yet every romantic legend stopped
short of a wedding? How come?

488
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:51,916
You ever heard a story told about
the romance of any married couple?

489
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:55,582
Of course.
And everyone in the world knows

490
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:59,250
Emperor Shah Jahan
gave his wife Mumtaz

491
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,416
the finest tribute to love. Taj Mahal

492
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:12,333
xxxxxxxxxxxx

493
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:28,000
"Chocolate heroes"

494
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:33,249
"They're screaming for love..."

495
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:39,209
"these roadside Romeos..."

496
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:51,375
"but they'll duck the wedding"

497
00:42:51,625 --> 00:43:09,792
"Chocolate heroes"

498
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:29,542
"Deep down inside whatever he is..."

499
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,833
"he'll put up a heroic posture"

500
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:38,250
"All day he's ogling books..."

501
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,999
"full of girlie posters"

502
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,165
"He'll say life's a carnival..."

503
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,499
"but marriage is trouble"

504
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,750
"So show him the door"

505
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,750
"Chocolate hero"

506
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:24,458
"Talk of marrying..."

507
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:29,874
"and he throws a fit"

508
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:33,125
"Talk of living-in..."

509
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:37,667
"you'll find he swears by it"

510
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:41,249
"In every girl he finds romance"

511
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,416
"But commitment, not a chance"

512
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:48,000
"He'll never find Juliet
so Romeo loses his shirt"

513
00:44:48,250 --> 00:45:06,208
"Chocolate heroes"

514
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:29,249
"He'll grow up to become
an ageing beast..."

515
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,915
"and the coughing will rack
his ancient chest..."

516
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:38,416
"he won't find a helping hand..."

517
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:42,957
"then he'll miss love's caring wand"

518
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:47,458
"When he is abandoned,
then he will repent"

519
00:45:47,459 --> 00:45:52,041
"And then finally,
he will remember me"

520
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:47,915
The bridegroom has come.

521
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:50,249
What's all this excitement over?
Fetching the bridegroom?

522
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,207
He's bound to turn up, isn't he?
If he fails to turn up...

523
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:57,875
then you've reason for excitement...
the bridegroom is missing...

524
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:34,792
What a naughty boy

525
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:57,499
"Where ends our story?"

526
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,665
"Story? Ours?"

527
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:01,499
"A story is happening around every one.

528
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,375
When we meet others, our stories meet"

529
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:07,333
"There's no story about us. There's only

530
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:13,583
"The End" and this is the end"

531
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,166
I wish Mamma was here

532
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:10,917
You know she's busy at home.
If she could've come, she would

533
00:49:11,334 --> 00:49:12,832
Carrying prayer candles

534
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:15,166
What...? - Always transpires
with prayer candles

535
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:22,417
Mamma, I thought you wouldn't make it

536
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:26,417
I was held up

537
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:32,083
I thought I'd miss your flight.
But Karan took care of everything

538
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:44,625
Friend's colony?
I live in Friends Colony too

539
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:48,540
Sorry, I lied. Actually
I live in Kailash Colony

540
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:54,125
But now that we've met
Let's meet up more

541
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:02,540
No use

542
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,749
No use. You'll end up taking her out,

543
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,749
splurging on her...

544
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,749
And when you're dropping her home

545
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,749
you'll hope she asks you in for coffee

546
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,416
She won't

547
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:19,166
How can you say?

548
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:26,749
Even I did my bit. But don't worry

549
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,082
my success rate wasn't hundred percent

550
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:33,249
Many a times, I was
left thirsting for coffee

551
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:38,249
You think I don't think like you?

552
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,416
For you as many girls as you wish?

553
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:44,749
For me, only one for a whole lifetime?

554
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,749
Don't worry, Rhea didn't
make a wrong decision

555
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,749
No boring scenes as in when I suddenly

556
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,249
realize that you're in love with Rhea

557
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:58,082
Even if he does, too bad

558
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:02,250
We need women more than they need us

559
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:04,416
And somewhere inside all of us guys,

560
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:10,709
there's a kid who refuses to grow up

561
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:15,124
No matter... how feeble
she might seem...

562
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:18,375
but in here we're far weaker

563
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:24,457
But you won't understand now

564
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:28,375
The day you find your Rhea, you'll know

565
00:52:13,334 --> 00:52:17,416
You always appear just
when I've forgotten all about you

566
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:23,250
Which means, you think of me
all the time when I'm away

567
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,041
I never meant that

568
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:28,874
If you wish never to see me again...

569
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:31,874
you must think of me always

570
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,707
Because when you've
forgotten all about me...

571
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:37,125
I'll make my appearance- Yes

572
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:42,792
But if you're thinking of me always
you're actually wishing you'd see me

573
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:45,041
Right?
Yes... no...

574
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:50,292
That's why a boy and a girl
can never be friends- Why?

575
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:55,458
Because you girls always end up
talking about love

576
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,625
Then you and I
will never be friends

577
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:39,875
Dad, will you ever be on time...?

578
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:07,167
"I'm no poet"

579
00:54:07,792 --> 00:54:11,875
"But my pretty one..."

580
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:15,875
"ever since I've seen you..."

581
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:21,042
"poetry just dawned upon me"

582
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:39,541
"I had heard of love, no doubt"

583
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:44,708
"But I didn't know what love was"

584
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:49,416
"I remained confused
as confusions generally are..."

585
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:54,250
"and remained an enemy among friends"

586
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:58,750
"Yet I'm no foe..."

587
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:03,416
"but dear pretty one..."

588
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:07,250
"having seen you..."

589
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:12,917
"I've learnt to make friends"

590
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:17,583
"And I was no poet"

591
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:31,459
Nice? Awful?

592
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:36,541
Your Dad isn't an international
photographer for nothing

593
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:40,541
Could I find her phone number?

594
00:55:40,542 --> 00:55:46,625
Now Paris? Aren't you tired of
shifting base every year or two?

595
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:49,749
What's tiring about it?

596
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,000
In the last eight years I've done
New York, Milan and now Paris

597
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,415
Who are you running from?
- Your mother

598
00:55:57,416 --> 00:56:00,415
I won't talk ill of
your mother in front of you

599
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:03,874
Dad! Not even behind my back

600
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:06,249
A man has a right to live his life, no?

601
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,249
If not my wife, whom do I criticize...

602
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:11,083
my neighbors wife?

603
00:56:11,084 --> 00:56:13,249
Even after all these years of living apart?

604
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:18,334
You still consider her your wife?

605
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:24,916
Mom was upset when
we shifted from Delhi.

606
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:29,415
She's settled down

607
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:35,500
Your room is over there.
- Thanks

608
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:48,916
Part of my last year's
photo exhibition

609
00:56:48,917 --> 00:56:54,208
Snacks? - Yes please

610
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:56,457
Your wife is fine, Dad

611
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:59,290
Did I ask how she is?

612
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:03,750
Not in as many words

613
00:57:10,959 --> 00:57:16,208
Good day, mister. Coffee or tea?

614
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:23,708
Good day, madam. Coffee or tea?
- Coffee.

615
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:43,250
Like I said, life's a long while
We keep meeting

616
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:56,833
That was bound to happen

617
00:57:56,834 --> 00:57:59,874
Every time we meet
something always goes wrong

618
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:02,040
You haven't changed a bit

619
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:05,959
What are you doing in Paris?
- I run a little boutique here

620
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:09,541
What are you doing here?

621
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:13,374
I'm pursuing love between "You and l"

622
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,708
Remember my cartoon characters
Hum-Tum?

623
00:58:16,709 --> 00:58:20,291
You won't believe it, the whole
country is raving about Hum-Tum

624
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:33,000
Publishers wanted me to write
a novel about Hum-Tum... in which...

625
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:37,000
they fall in love. Because Paris is
the most romantic city in the world...

626
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,374
here I am, catalyzing their romance.

627
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:41,874
And it's so awful, you're walking out?

628
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:46,542
No, it's my station.
All the best for your Hum-Tum

629
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,750
Say hi to Sameer

630
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:04,334
Sameer is no longer part of my life

631
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,749
That's a sandwich.
Meant to be eaten, not ogled

632
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,416
Should I call her up Dad?
- Certainly not

633
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:46,374
Wait till the next summer

634
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,124
I want to talk to her,

635
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:51,749
I want to know what happened to her

636
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,874
She isn't the same old Rhea

637
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:58,166
But she doesn't have a nice impression
of me.

638
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,040
Hope she doesn't get me wrong

639
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:06,167
If you wish to do a good turn,
do it. Don't hesitate

640
01:00:09,834 --> 01:00:13,457
If you keep mulling over it
you'll end up nowhere

641
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:17,625
Who will eat that food? Your Dad?
Not a bad idea, who wants to diet?

642
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:26,749
Can I speak to Rhea?

643
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:31,333
Who's calling?
I'm hearing Hindi after ages

644
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:36,833
Umrao Jaan, is that you? - Umrao Jaan?

645
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:41,916
Aunty, I'm Karan. Karan Kapoor.
Mrs. Kapoor's son

646
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:45,957
Is that you Tiger?
Where are you calling from?

647
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:49,000
I'm calling from Paris.
You needn't raise your voice

648
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:52,834
Shut up, I'm tired of talking
in hushed tones

649
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:56,124
Blast their diction, they always
seem to be conspiring in whispers

650
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:58,874
If you're in Paris aren't
you coming over to see us?

651
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:01,791
Give me your address and
I'll be over in a flash

652
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:05,041
Address? You know how
these names sound

653
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:08,333
...I went to school till 8th standard

654
01:01:08,584 --> 01:01:11,541
Yes I can manage English,

655
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,749
but this language...
never heard anything like it

656
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,750
French... never speak what they write.
More like they are gargling.

657
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:24,500
I'll give it a try. Write

658
01:01:30,417 --> 01:01:38,208
It's a red building on the street.
I can't manage the name of the house

659
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:42,584
Made of olden type red bricks

660
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:54,833
Sometime in life some things happen
and you lose faith in God

661
01:01:56,417 --> 01:02:02,333
Did Sameer and Rhea hurt anyone?
Just after their first anniversary...

662
01:02:06,916 --> 01:02:10,999
like everyday Sameer
was leaving for work

663
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,833
Some college students jumped
a traffic signal for the fun of it

664
01:02:16,292 --> 01:02:20,709
And in a moment's time,
Rhea's life changed forever

665
01:02:23,542 --> 01:02:27,791
Time was when she lit up my life
whenever she came home

666
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:34,458
Nowadays she's so quiet...

667
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:43,041
She left America, India...
and now she's here...

668
01:02:44,417 --> 01:02:47,459
where she knows no one
and no one knows her

669
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:51,958
I think she wants
to get lost in the crowds

670
01:02:56,125 --> 01:03:00,958
Now it's as if Rhea is lost herself

671
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:06,417
My Rhea lived life on her own terms;

672
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:12,833
in life's hands, she suffers her defeat

673
01:03:26,584 --> 01:03:29,790
Just met your mother

674
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:34,667
Can I share your umbrella?

675
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:53,250
In life, how often...

676
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,041
Sometimes whatever happens to us...

677
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:01,915
God what am I saying...?

678
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:06,708
Whatever I say, what use...

679
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:22,915
You're home

680
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:27,750
And you couldn't even say
how you liked the conversation

681
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:37,874
Thank you Karan - What for?

682
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:43,750
For what you've been trying to say

683
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,500
Hey Rhea, can I borrow your umbrella?

684
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:28,458
One minute... your phone.

685
01:05:28,459 --> 01:05:33,207
Who is it? - No idea

686
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:34,957
This is such a problem.

687
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:37,291
I grasp
Neither the language nor the cuisine

688
01:05:37,292 --> 01:05:42,542
I end up eating what I never ordered.

689
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:46,832
And I get to return your umbrella

690
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:49,875
No Karan. Not lunch.
I'm busy tomorrow

691
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:06,499
He only asked you out for lunch

692
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,665
You could've said dinner

693
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:11,540
All day you sit at home.
You could do with an outing

694
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:15,124
What a life. Home-to-boutique-to-home

695
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:18,874
I'm only watching my thriller

696
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:23,958
Lovely song. Shammi Kapoor is a star

697
01:06:24,209 --> 01:06:29,125
My darling baby

698
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:42,374
Finding that Chinese
restaurant was tough

699
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,540
You said you'd be busy.

700
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:50,000
So I thought let's have lunch here

701
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:56,374
Come on, I am famished

702
01:06:56,375 --> 01:07:01,166
Why are you doing this, Karan?

703
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:05,041
Why this expression of sympathy?

704
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:06,540
This is the reason

705
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:10,041
why I didn't
return to India after Sameer died

706
01:07:10,042 --> 01:07:15,667
I hate seeing people pitying me

707
01:07:16,209 --> 01:07:19,334
The food bill. 32 Euros

708
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:24,583
Your share is 16 Euros. Remember?
You only said fifty-fifty

709
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:37,542
Can we eat? I'm really hungry

710
01:07:41,917 --> 01:07:44,249
Lovely food

711
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:46,582
How did you find out I like Chinese?

712
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:52,166
- I never knew. I love Chinese

713
01:07:57,292 --> 01:08:02,875
Eat in peace.
Let me take care of her

714
01:08:19,292 --> 01:08:21,957
Pretty child. - Thank you

715
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:27,708
Something about me?
- I only said she's a pretty child

716
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:35,333
You picked up French so fast?

717
01:08:35,334 --> 01:08:39,166
Must know the language where you live

718
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:42,250
I seem to be able to make do
with Hindi anywhere in the world

719
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:49,584
If they don't know Hindi
I make sure I teach them some

720
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,999
If I don't teach Hindi
to those French kids...

721
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,084
you can change my
name to something French

722
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:04,917
But if I succeed, you'll
do as I say. - Do what...?

723
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:21,583
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

724
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,707
"Chuck up every woe"

725
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:29,292
"Chuck it, I'm with you"

726
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:47,167
"Try and smile once"

727
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:51,500
"Let hues of the Spring
blossom once again"

728
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:04,167
"Sing a new song, strike a new melody"

729
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:08,500
"It's a new season, it's a new day"

730
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:10,707
"Chuck it..."

731
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:12,916
"chuck every woe"

732
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:16,583
"Chuck it, I'm with you"

733
01:10:51,959 --> 01:10:55,875
"Unleash new joys,
sing a new rhapsody"

734
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:59,875
"Let loose your moorings
ride new waves of ecstasy"

735
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:13,209
"Get the bounce on your feet
let dance the sands at your feet"

736
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:17,209
"Feel your spirits rise
and reach for the skies"

737
01:11:56,542 --> 01:12:13,333
"It's the only life you ever had
through twists and turns, good or bad"

738
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:22,125
"Hug every moment, get life's feel.
Smile, life's joys you can steal"

739
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:33,457
What are you doing? My bags...

740
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:35,624
I don't run a hotel.

741
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:37,457
If you're living
with me, you'll socialize with me

742
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:39,624
If you're seeing only Rhea
find someplace else

743
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:45,958
Out you go.
You're not staying with me

744
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:50,791
These dramatics don't suit you.
Open the door

745
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:53,624
Spending so much time with a girl
doesn't suit you either

746
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:57,958
By the way, is it serious?

747
01:13:57,959 --> 01:14:02,124
What an awkward monologue with
a door.

748
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:04,999
On one condition.
You'll introduce me to Rhea

749
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,958
Rhea has invited us to lunch tomorrow

750
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:15,666
The door was open?

751
01:14:15,667 --> 01:14:20,250
You think I'm a bad dad
who'll lock his son out in the cold?

752
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:27,083
I'm a bad boy

753
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,457
Excuse me...

754
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:34,332
Is Karan in?

755
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:38,833
I am Arjun Kapoor. Good day.
- Good day. I'm Nicole

756
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:44,459
Welcome

757
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:48,541
Namaste. - Namaste

758
01:14:48,542 --> 01:14:51,625
So you are Karan's "bau'ji"...
- "Bau'ji"...?

759
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:58,458
Myself Mrs. Parminder Prakash.
You can call me Bobby

760
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:03,207
I'd rather call you Dimple,
the actress who played Bobby

761
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:06,709
Your Bau'ji is very
colorful, Karan. - Dad...

762
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:13,083
Flowers for my Umrao Jaan.
- Lovely flowers. Nice boy

763
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:18,666
I wish I had carried those flowers

764
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:21,374
Please come in

765
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:22,708
Do come inside

766
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:24,874
Nice house. - Thank you

767
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:29,833
So you've taken after your father

768
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:34,374
Son...

769
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:38,416
I want to see Rhea married again

770
01:15:38,417 --> 01:15:40,916
You ought to talk to my mother

771
01:15:40,917 --> 01:15:43,708
She organizes weddings

772
01:15:43,709 --> 01:15:48,416
Silly, I didn't mean that

773
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:52,875
You aren't talking about me...?
- I love my daughter dearly

774
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:55,416
Would I ever want her to marry
someone like you?

775
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:58,749
Thank God. I was scared

776
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:03,834
Life is meant to be lived
...to the fullest

777
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:11,125
I know what Loneliness means

778
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:15,791
At least I had Rhea

779
01:16:15,792 --> 01:16:19,457
After I'm gone, who stays with Rhea?

780
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:22,957
Everyone of us needs someone...

781
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:28,292
For company, love, support

782
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:34,208
But I have a feeling
That Rhea will refuse to agree

783
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:38,457
That's why she is living here.
But whom will she find here?

784
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:45,041
But son, if we can find a
nice boy I think it'll work out

785
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:49,292
So you're looking for
someone conservative, homely...

786
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:57,750
Because interesting boys like you
Never make nice husbands

787
01:17:05,834 --> 01:17:08,833
What happened uncle?

788
01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:13,165
Nothing, just remembered someone

789
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:16,250
I met her a few years ago.
She's very beautiful

790
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:24,040
The only beauty I could never capture
In my camera

791
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:26,541
nor into my life

792
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:31,874
I should not be asking, but...
- Then don't ask

793
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:32,874
Come in, I'll tell you

794
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:38,625
I was just back from London
after a course in photography

795
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:42,040
Then I met Anju

796
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:45,207
Anju's world was very different
from mine.

797
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:48,292
She was plain Simple girl.
With a strong mind

798
01:17:49,709 --> 01:17:52,874
That's the quality in her
that sets her apart

799
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:58,292
You may have conquered the world, but...

800
01:17:58,709 --> 01:18:01,040
We married

801
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:04,250
To make each other happy,
initially we made our compromises

802
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:08,000
Like where-are-you-going, who-is-she?
Maybe I was not prepared for marriage

803
01:18:08,875 --> 01:18:12,333
Afterwards questions that had
never been raised cropped up

804
01:18:13,208 --> 01:18:16,207
I guess I was not ready for marriage.

805
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:20,000
With time, there was more work,
more quarrels. In a fit of rage...

806
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:24,916
I took up a six-month
assignment in America

807
01:18:25,916 --> 01:18:29,208
She asked not a question,
I gave no answers

808
01:18:30,417 --> 01:18:33,583
For six months I waited for a call
from her;

809
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:36,082
maybe she waited for mine

810
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:41,083
Then six months became a year
and years became ages.

811
01:18:44,584 --> 01:18:47,583
On one count I'm grateful to her

812
01:18:47,584 --> 01:18:51,292
She never let Karan feel
the distance between us

813
01:18:54,584 --> 01:18:58,249
I don't know why I'm telling you this

814
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:02,915
...I never even confided in myself

815
01:19:02,916 --> 01:19:07,124
Neither to me

816
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:11,875
Wish you had tried at least once...

817
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:19,957
So neither have you
been able to forgive me

818
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:23,957
I forgave you long ago, Dad.

819
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:27,667
But I never got over what you did

820
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:47,000
Maybe you ought to say sorry
to someone else

821
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:52,499
You must think I'm evil

822
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:57,500
No one's evil. Evil
are the times that befall

823
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,332
You're saying I've fallen
into evil times

824
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:04,417
There you are. Come inside.
I don't serve a bad lunch

825
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:10,332
Sure... - Out there
it's colder than Amritsar

826
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:13,916
I never could bring up
this topic with my dad

827
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:23,125
If you tell anyone I cried

828
01:20:43,542 --> 01:20:47,792
The one with the dog?

829
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:58,333
You're incorrigible!

830
01:21:00,542 --> 01:21:04,333
I wonder what her mother's like. - What...?

831
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:10,167
Rhea, father and son are incorrigible

832
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:19,667
Let's go in.

833
01:21:28,334 --> 01:21:32,417
You aren't dressed yet?
Not going to the airport? Get dressed

834
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:36,499
Spare me. - Why?

835
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:42,416
I can't bid goodbyes

836
01:21:46,542 --> 01:21:52,250
Getting late, I should make a move

837
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:21,459
Remember, we met at the airport

838
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:24,875
After that first meeting...

839
01:22:28,542 --> 01:22:32,792
Of course not

840
01:22:33,042 --> 01:22:36,374
That's why you tried to kiss me

841
01:22:36,375 --> 01:22:41,374
Only tried?

842
01:22:41,375 --> 01:22:44,374
Then I hated you so much all
because...

843
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:48,334
you didn't know how to talk,
you had no respect for women...

844
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:53,041
you were so ill-mannered and irritating

845
01:22:53,042 --> 01:22:59,500
After all these years
you remember everything about me?

846
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:07,624
Did you hit upon a story
for your Hum-Tum?

847
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:13,375
I have something in mind. In the end
who knows Hum-Tum may fall in love

848
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:24,042
You know Karan, I didn't think
I would ever admit this to you

849
01:23:31,958 --> 01:23:35,999
We're going to see each other
very soon. Guess why?

850
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,124
Because though life's a long while

851
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:43,041
we have very little time

852
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,374
Are we going to be friends now?

853
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:13,625
Friends? But you always said
you'd never make friends with girls

854
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:17,582
Pretty girls are the exception

855
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:20,958
And I am not pretty! - When did I say that?

856
01:24:21,209 --> 01:24:27,125
Are you saying I'm pretty?

857
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:46,916
Rhea is coming after 3 days? - Yes

858
01:24:46,917 --> 01:24:49,582
Whose friend is she,
yours or mine? - Mine

859
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:55,875
And am I your chauffeur
or secretary? - Neither

860
01:24:57,416 --> 01:24:59,249
Then why do you want me to
pick her up from the airport?

861
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:04,542
Because I want you to marry her

862
01:25:06,917 --> 01:25:11,415
You want me to marry Rhea...?
- Exactly

863
01:25:11,416 --> 01:25:14,500
Come on Mihir, you're
perfect for each other

864
01:25:15,792 --> 01:25:19,457
If Rhea is perfect
why don't you marry her?

865
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:21,957
I can't marry Rhea. - Why?

866
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:28,042
I'm the sort a mother
would warn her daughter about

867
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:36,042
I know Rhea. She needs
a mature, experienced guy

868
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:46,583
In three days, Rhea is coming.
Pick her up at the airport

869
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:52,875
If you don't like her
you needn't see her ever again

870
01:25:54,167 --> 01:26:00,083
When did I say yes?
- You didn't say no

871
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:06,166
I can't believe it
...I'm doing your bidding

872
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:10,458
If Rhea realizes that I'm introducing
the two of you

873
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:15,041
After the wedding,
can I tell her we're married?

874
01:26:15,042 --> 01:26:19,583
Not bad!
Already contemplating the marriage?

875
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:24,874
Rhea is putting up with her aunt.
She knows the address

876
01:26:24,875 --> 01:26:28,292
Come on, I'm busy. Hang up

877
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:38,458
Australia fields so well
even in video games

878
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:50,832
Yes... you...?

879
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:54,500
Karan's friend. Not chauffeur so...

880
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:57,833
So you are Mihir.
Myself Mrs. Parminder Prakash

881
01:26:59,042 --> 01:27:02,667
How handsome
You're just like Karan described you

882
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:05,707
Karan described...?

883
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:11,833
No... he didn't. He only said
Mihir would receive us in his stead

884
01:27:12,042 --> 01:27:16,667
You couldn't tell me that before?
- Such a long flight. I'm at wits' end

885
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:27,083
Something cropped up suddenly.
Karan is busy... so I had to come

886
01:27:27,084 --> 01:27:31,375
Suddenly? But you said
Karan informed my Mummy about you...

887
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:36,457
The car is parked outside. Shall we...?

888
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:39,582
Which car do you have?

889
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:45,375
Just asking, because
we've got so much luggage

890
01:27:53,416 --> 01:27:56,290
There's something about India

891
01:27:56,291 --> 01:27:57,916
The country has a smell of it's own...

892
01:27:57,917 --> 01:28:01,209
Look, kids defecating along the kerb

893
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:05,958
Nice to be here

894
01:28:05,959 --> 01:28:10,208
Son what do you do?
- I run a business in computers

895
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:15,499
I see. How much turnover?

896
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:19,208
Rhea is also a computer buff- Really?

897
01:28:20,167 --> 01:28:23,375
Not much, except office computing

898
01:28:27,042 --> 01:28:32,458
Karan says you run a store in Paris.
- Not store. Boutique of Indian designs

899
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,832
Boutique is a store, no...?

900
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:39,875
You come into India and you grab
a paper! Always reading

901
01:28:40,167 --> 01:28:45,750
Times of India carries Karan's Hum-Tum

902
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:50,917
This Karan is... - Yes Karan...

903
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:54,999
Yes this Karan is...

904
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,375
I just joined the chorus

905
01:29:09,708 --> 01:29:13,084
In Bombay you don't
disconnect phones at night?

906
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:31,291
You're angry? Okay I'm going home

907
01:29:31,959 --> 01:29:36,207
I'm standing outside your house

908
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:42,500
I'm famished.
Can I find something to eat?

909
01:29:44,042 --> 01:29:47,707
Mamma is right.
Your country is your own

910
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:53,167
Who told you to live in Paris?

911
01:29:57,708 --> 01:30:06,000
If I stayed in India, everyone would've
begun to insist that I marry again

912
01:30:07,542 --> 01:30:12,166
After Sameer died,
I wasn't interested anymore

913
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:20,667
You can't stop loving someone because
he's dead. I'll always love Sameer

914
01:30:25,083 --> 01:30:29,542
But does it mean that you can't
pick up the threads of your life?

915
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:38,834
True. But to start afresh
one needs a good companion

916
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:43,208
Not someone in an arranged marriage.
- What if you might find someone?

917
01:30:45,417 --> 01:30:50,875
I think arranged marriages work

918
01:30:51,667 --> 01:30:55,041
Let's pretend I'm here
to look up an arranged match

919
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:57,791
Pretences at 2 am!

920
01:30:57,792 --> 01:30:59,624
Hello Rhea I'm Champak Bhumiya

921
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:03,124
Your aunt's niece's daughter'
friend speaks highly of you

922
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:06,542
She says we're perfect for
each other. Made for each other

923
01:31:10,792 --> 01:31:13,875
Not Champak Bhumiya.
If a genuine, smart guy...

924
01:31:14,333 --> 01:31:17,875
asks you whether
after so many years in Paris...

925
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:24,083
will you be able to adjust to
Bombay life? With me?

926
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,250
Okay what were you asking?
- After Paris...

927
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:41,083
will you be able to adjust in Bombay?
- More important than the city...

928
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:44,332
is adjustment between people.
If two people are happy together...

929
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:49,708
Bombay or Paris, what difference?

930
01:31:49,709 --> 01:31:53,959
After the marriage, will you work?
- You don't want me to work afterwards?

931
01:31:56,208 --> 01:32:01,291
I think every woman should work.
Not as a pass time. Serious work. Like you

932
01:32:05,208 --> 01:32:08,374
Now what about kids.
- What about kids...?

933
01:32:08,375 --> 01:32:13,125
Not you. Aren't you supposed to ask me?
Whether I love kids?

934
01:32:13,375 --> 01:32:16,458
Yes, do you love kids? - Of course

935
01:32:16,709 --> 01:32:20,125
First I want a daughter.
Beautiful, intelligent. Like you

936
01:32:20,709 --> 01:32:22,040
I'll make a fine daddy

937
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:26,625
If I find someone like me flirting
with her, I'll break his legs

938
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:33,500
You think that will make you a fine daddy?
- Look you'll make a fine mother

939
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:36,874
What harm if I spoil the kids a little bit?

940
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:40,207
So I do all the hard work
and you have all the fun?

941
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:42,874
Yes, look at it from my point of view
and it's a wonderful marriage

942
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:48,500
A puppy is all it'll take
to complete the family portrait

943
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:52,040
Let's call him Tommy. - Awful name

944
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:57,166
Okay Tommy. On one condition.
You take Tommy out for walks

945
01:32:57,916 --> 01:33:04,375
I'll only feed him morsels from my plate.
"Tommy, take"

946
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:07,583
Apart from spoiling the kids and Tommy
what else will you do?

947
01:33:07,584 --> 01:33:10,875
What else is left to be done?
I'll live happily ever after...

948
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:14,875
with my kids and Tommy
...and of course, you. Sorry

949
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:17,749
So I come after the kids and Tommy.

950
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:24,124
With you. - I come after
the kids and Tommy?

951
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:26,915
Mention me after the kids and Tommy

952
01:33:26,916 --> 01:33:29,791
and I'll hack you into small bits...

953
01:33:29,792 --> 01:33:34,709
and I'll feed you to Tommy.
- Okay I'm sorry. No more kids-or-Tommy

954
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:38,208
I'll always love you
more than anyone else

955
01:33:44,041 --> 01:33:47,375
See how easy it is to discuss
an arranged marriage...?

956
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:52,708
We almost got married

957
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:08,165
How are you? - How are you?

958
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:11,584
You look gorgeous.
- I ought to be telling you that

959
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:19,584
Sit. How about coffee, tea, juice...?
- Just coming from our place

960
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:22,832
And you know Mamma never lets
me leave before breakfast

961
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:27,042
How is she?

962
01:34:36,041 --> 01:34:39,374
But Rhea, these formalities...

963
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:45,583
Actually Karan's dad
has sent it for you

964
01:34:47,208 --> 01:34:51,958
He's fine

965
01:34:55,208 --> 01:34:58,207
Rhea, I'm the one
who makes your Ma laugh all the time

966
01:34:58,208 --> 01:35:02,708
And you make my Mom upset
as soon as you step in

967
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:06,959
Don't fall for what she says

968
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:18,500
I hope they send 150 pieces. I'll pay
after I've checked the consignment

969
01:35:18,709 --> 01:35:21,040
If I find a one-piece short
in the shipment... - God! One piece...

970
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:24,374
how much poorer will it make you,
how much richer will he become?

971
01:35:24,375 --> 01:35:30,500
You women are forever cribbing over
one Rupee, one potato, one coriander leaf...

972
01:35:30,709 --> 01:35:36,167
why fight over trivia?
- It isn't about money. It's principle

973
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:43,667
But why discuss principles with you?

974
01:35:45,916 --> 01:35:49,208
Yes Mihir, come over, park the car

975
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:54,333
Mihir is coming?
- Yes... I forgot to ask you...

976
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:58,041
how did you find Mihir? - Okay

977
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:02,041
But what is Mihir doing here?
- I thought we'd have lunch together

978
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:06,541
Here he is

979
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:08,915
So how was your shopping?

980
01:36:08,916 --> 01:36:12,749
I wasn't shopping. It was business

981
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:16,790
I'm hungry. Where are we going for lunch?

982
01:36:16,791 --> 01:36:19,833
What happened?
- Lunch reminds me...

983
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:23,375
I have to meet Diana.
- Who's this lady?

984
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:27,375
Just a friend. Met her a week ago.
Strictly business

985
01:36:30,542 --> 01:36:34,208
Not your first lunch date with Diana?
- Lunch, yes. For the first time

986
01:36:34,459 --> 01:36:36,207
Couple of days ago
we went out for dinner

987
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:38,458
You go ahead and have lunch.

988
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:44,208
I'll see
you afterwards for coffee. Got to run

989
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:52,542
I know a great joint for grilled fish.

990
01:37:01,875 --> 01:37:04,832
I don't like grilled fish

991
01:37:04,833 --> 01:37:13,417
Where to? China garden? Delhi Durbar?
- I forgot... Mamma has cooked lunch

992
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,499
Will you drop me home?

993
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:24,917
Next to your place
there's a Dosa Diner

994
01:37:28,584 --> 01:37:30,707
Today's my birthday

995
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:35,292
Strange! Karan never told me.
- Karan must've forgotten

996
01:38:12,042 --> 01:38:15,167
Strange, you never reminded me
it's your birthday

997
01:38:15,542 --> 01:38:20,666
Sorry, I forgot that you forget.
- Never mind. Eat cake

998
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:28,000
Something tells me
I'm forgetting something

999
01:38:33,417 --> 01:38:37,334
Enough of your apologies!
You forget that you invited me?

1000
01:38:37,583 --> 01:38:42,249
I waited for you for ages

1001
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:48,042
Don't ask me how I know you're Rhea

1002
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:55,042
What sort of birthday...? No champagne?

1003
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:09,458
Mihir you didn't tell me what you do.

1004
01:39:09,459 --> 01:39:12,458
- I run a computer company. Micro India

1005
01:39:12,459 --> 01:39:14,957
We design computer systems

1006
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:18,875
Really? All the computers in
my office were sourced from you?

1007
01:39:19,125 --> 01:39:23,167
Wiz Entertainment.
- You're Diana Fernandez?

1008
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:26,624
No wonder your voice sounded familiar.

1009
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:29,041
We've spoken several times on the phone

1010
01:39:29,042 --> 01:39:30,790
You actually spoke to her or you heard

1011
01:39:30,791 --> 01:39:33,208
of her conversations over the phone?

1012
01:39:33,209 --> 01:39:37,083
After so many conversations
now we meet... amazing

1013
01:39:38,125 --> 01:39:39,999
How amazing

1014
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,083
Karan, what a boring song. - Awful song

1015
01:39:45,334 --> 01:39:49,333
To that song, for the first time
I danced with a girl

1016
01:39:49,334 --> 01:39:53,750
We danced pretty close

1017
01:39:57,334 --> 01:40:03,583
Just let them be. - She's a...

1018
01:40:19,958 --> 01:40:22,458
How strange. For the many times that

1019
01:40:22,459 --> 01:40:25,541
they talked business, they never met

1020
01:40:25,958 --> 01:40:29,459
One chance meeting
and they've taken to each other

1021
01:40:29,708 --> 01:40:33,958
Somewhat too fast. Who'll say
it's their first meeting?

1022
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,375
Sometimes the first look is enough.
Sometimes it takes so many meetings

1023
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:54,540
What...? - True

1024
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:58,500
Yes

1025
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:05,707
Your last chance
...no second last chance

1026
01:41:05,708 --> 01:41:11,166
I mean Mihir and Diana...

1027
01:41:14,458 --> 01:41:21,708
you know...
Mihir and Diana, they're so unlike

1028
01:41:21,917 --> 01:41:25,000
I don't know how they liked each other

1029
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:29,542
They're so different

1030
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:33,249
It's widely accepted that

1031
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:37,833
the more varied the match
the better it is for the relationship

1032
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:41,083
She makes up for her husband's flaws;

1033
01:41:41,084 --> 01:41:43,749
he makes up for his wife's shortcomings

1034
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:47,833
Which makes for a perfect marriage.
- Rhea, you ought to be writing a book

1035
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:53,542
Principles of Marriage by Rhea

1036
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:03,957
Tonight I'm happy... elated

1037
01:42:03,958 --> 01:42:06,957
Guess why?

1038
01:42:06,958 --> 01:42:14,541
I just got engaged Mihir and I...

1039
01:42:15,792 --> 01:42:18,875
and the person instrumental
in getting us together... is...

1040
01:42:30,167 --> 01:42:35,084
If Rhea liked Mihir,
if Mihir liked Rhea...

1041
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,166
then you and I
wouldn't have been here today

1042
01:42:39,167 --> 01:42:42,917
Karan tried his best to make
Rhea and Mihir fall in love

1043
01:42:43,708 --> 01:42:49,583
Then I materialized I guess I got lucky

1044
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,917
So... cheers to Rhea once again
Oh Mihir, I love you

1045
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:06,167
Please give me a chance to explain

1046
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:09,874
You've no right to scorn me

1047
01:43:09,875 --> 01:43:12,874
Scorn? I was arranging your marriage.

1048
01:43:12,875 --> 01:43:16,292
I went away to Paris to avoid this

1049
01:43:16,541 --> 01:43:19,958
You know it... because out there no one
would be arranging weddings for me

1050
01:43:20,209 --> 01:43:23,458
I don't get it! Why won't people leave
a girl in peace until she's married?

1051
01:43:23,708 --> 01:43:26,208
Is marriage the sole
purpose of life for us?

1052
01:43:26,209 --> 01:43:29,458
Without a man in her life
a woman's life is incomplete?

1053
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:33,208
What tangent are you getting at?
- And you Karan...?

1054
01:43:33,209 --> 01:43:38,499
I never expected you to behave like this

1055
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:44,000
Over something so little...
- It's nothing so little

1056
01:43:44,042 --> 01:43:47,540
Not everything in life is a joke

1057
01:43:47,541 --> 01:43:50,874
So what now?
Do we sit down for a quarrel?

1058
01:43:50,875 --> 01:43:55,874
Forget it You don't get what I'm saying

1059
01:43:55,875 --> 01:43:59,916
I thought you and Mihir...
- What about Mihir and I...?

1060
01:43:59,917 --> 01:44:04,333
How can you think like this?
Did you ever ask me what I want?

1061
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:06,582
I only want to see you happy

1062
01:44:06,583 --> 01:44:10,500
You think I'll be happy with Mihir?
- Will you be happy with a guy like me?

1063
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:19,709
Now why are you quite?

1064
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:46,708
Love is the problem, isn't it?

1065
01:44:49,959 --> 01:44:53,542
Karan was right.
A boy and a girl can never be friends

1066
01:44:54,625 --> 01:44:59,124
Because love always comes in the way

1067
01:44:59,125 --> 01:45:03,333
How long will you hide
your feelings from each other?

1068
01:45:04,625 --> 01:45:08,542
If you expect Karan to make
the first move, forget it

1069
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:13,124
That fool doesn't even
realize he's in love

1070
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:15,166
No one knows Karan more than I

1071
01:45:15,167 --> 01:45:17,499
Every year he forgets my birthday, but

1072
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:20,499
each little word about you, he remembers

1073
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:26,042
If not love what else is it?

1074
01:45:26,333 --> 01:45:30,833
Loves you dearly

1075
01:45:30,834 --> 01:45:35,249
True love is so hard to come by
it happens only once in a lifetime

1076
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:38,750
To have found this
joy twice you're lucky

1077
01:45:56,375 --> 01:46:01,291
Simple. I'm not a nice guy

1078
01:46:01,542 --> 01:46:05,792
Not a nice guy and
when it comes to girls...

1079
01:46:06,042 --> 01:46:09,625
first class scoundrel.
- He's one of us

1080
01:46:10,291 --> 01:46:12,374
You get it?

1081
01:46:12,375 --> 01:46:18,708
For the first time in my life
I wanted to do good for a girl

1082
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:23,124
Did I do anything wrong? - No

1083
01:46:23,125 --> 01:46:26,667
I did. - You did...? - Big mistake I did

1084
01:46:28,708 --> 01:46:32,708
Big mistake... I broke her heart

1085
01:46:34,208 --> 01:46:40,834
The tears... welled up from her heart.

1086
01:46:41,542 --> 01:46:42,707
I made her cry

1087
01:46:42,708 --> 01:46:46,499
Made her cry?

1088
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:49,583
When her tears stream down here...

1089
01:46:50,208 --> 01:46:59,667
why do I ache in here?
Her eyes, her tears

1090
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:04,541
And here it aches?

1091
01:47:04,542 --> 01:47:06,916
Is this any justice? - No

1092
01:47:06,917 --> 01:47:09,916
Oh yes it's justice

1093
01:47:09,917 --> 01:47:12,874
This is justice

1094
01:47:12,875 --> 01:47:16,333
If the burden of both tears and pain

1095
01:47:16,917 --> 01:47:21,708
were hers, what justice would it be?

1096
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:28,667
Were her tears and her pain to be mine,
justice would be done.

1097
01:47:30,291 --> 01:47:31,041
Understood?

1098
01:47:31,042 --> 01:47:34,542
Understood. - What can you understand?

1099
01:47:35,625 --> 01:47:38,875
She says I don't understand anything.

1100
01:47:40,959 --> 01:47:45,041
If I never understood anything...
how come I understand

1101
01:47:45,291 --> 01:47:49,542
I'm no match for her

1102
01:47:53,291 --> 01:47:54,332
Understand?

1103
01:47:54,333 --> 01:47:59,083
Understood. She's coming for you

1104
01:48:00,166 --> 01:48:04,250
She isn't after me- Behind you

1105
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:12,833
Hide the glasses.
No drinking in front of a lady

1106
01:48:12,834 --> 01:48:16,250
But I can drink because
I'm not a nice guy. Pass my glass

1107
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:21,416
Karan, come home

1108
01:48:21,417 --> 01:48:26,083
Rhea, I'm not a nice guy

1109
01:48:30,417 --> 01:48:34,958
Not nice

1110
01:48:34,959 --> 01:48:44,875
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

1111
01:49:00,709 --> 01:49:06,125
"Let our sighs caress"

1112
01:49:17,542 --> 01:49:23,166
"Let subdued heartbeats race"

1113
01:49:23,375 --> 01:49:28,667
"This moment craves... a tryst..."

1114
01:49:28,875 --> 01:49:39,083
"yours and mine"

1115
01:49:40,083 --> 01:49:45,166
"Your eyes let me enchant"

1116
01:49:45,584 --> 01:49:51,166
"In your arms take me as I relent"

1117
01:49:51,584 --> 01:49:56,667
"This moment craves... a tryst..."

1118
01:49:56,916 --> 01:50:03,375
"yours and mine"

1119
01:50:33,792 --> 01:50:39,041
"Let our sighs caress"

1120
01:50:39,292 --> 01:50:44,584
"Slumber's caress smears
the kohl in your eyes"

1121
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:54,875
"Oh was it a fleeting
carnival of dreams...?"

1122
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:01,000
"Let desire consume us
body and soul"

1123
01:51:01,667 --> 01:51:06,916
"Leave yourself to rock
amid abandon and ecstasy"

1124
01:51:07,333 --> 01:51:12,417
"This moment craves... a tryst..."

1125
01:51:12,667 --> 01:51:23,458
"yours and mine"

1126
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:00,708
"Caress me..."

1127
01:52:00,709 --> 01:52:08,167
"like symphony's strings"

1128
01:52:09,208 --> 01:52:14,542
"Darkness hidden in your tresses..."

1129
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:19,500
"let loose, liberate my nights"

1130
01:52:20,208 --> 01:52:25,208
"Wait till night's veil
slips away from her bosom"

1131
01:52:25,709 --> 01:52:31,333
"Wait for dew to moisten her petals"

1132
01:52:31,584 --> 01:52:36,875
"But this moment craves... a tryst..."

1133
01:52:37,083 --> 01:52:47,584
"yours and mine"

1134
01:54:34,459 --> 01:54:39,208
Calm down

1135
01:54:39,833 --> 01:54:42,957
Don't take God's name in vain

1136
01:54:42,958 --> 01:54:46,250
Where's Rhea? - She isn't coming

1137
01:54:47,666 --> 01:54:52,375
You had a fight with her?

1138
01:54:57,666 --> 01:55:01,333
I left it in the car

1139
01:55:01,334 --> 01:55:06,084
You don't say shit inside a church

1140
01:55:11,917 --> 01:55:15,583
We were supposed to come
together, no? I waited for you

1141
01:55:15,875 --> 01:55:22,291
I got busy over here

1142
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:25,957
"I can't even face her"

1143
01:55:25,958 --> 01:55:31,708
"Idiot, even his tie isn't matching"

1144
01:55:34,208 --> 01:55:37,124
"What must she think of me?"

1145
01:55:37,125 --> 01:55:40,666
"Why did we take so long
to know each other's minds?"

1146
01:55:44,042 --> 01:55:46,082
"Whatever happened was wrong"

1147
01:55:46,083 --> 01:55:51,542
"Why does it feel so perfect?"

1148
01:55:52,167 --> 01:55:54,333
"I've lost her forever"

1149
01:55:54,334 --> 01:55:59,083
"I don't want to lose him, ever"

1150
01:56:00,334 --> 01:56:02,665
"Is this the end
of our relationship...?"

1151
01:56:02,666 --> 01:56:07,917
"The beginning
of a new relationship...?"

1152
01:56:45,125 --> 01:56:51,333
"How can I start this conversation?
Please, say something Karan"

1153
01:56:57,666 --> 01:56:59,540
Whatever happened should
never have come to pass

1154
01:56:59,541 --> 01:57:05,834
I mean, I should never have done that

1155
01:57:07,958 --> 01:57:11,874
We ought to get married

1156
01:57:11,875 --> 01:57:16,750
Yes we ought to get married- Why?

1157
01:57:22,042 --> 01:57:26,540
Why do you want to marry me Karan?

1158
01:57:26,541 --> 01:57:33,000
Don't get me wrong Rhea
- You're getting me wrong

1159
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:36,500
Do you feel that
whatever happened was wrong?

1160
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:45,834
Yes Rhea. The mistake was mine

1161
01:57:47,125 --> 01:57:51,249
Then we ought not to
commit another mistake

1162
01:57:51,250 --> 01:57:54,917
We ought not to make another mistake
by marrying for the wrong reasons

1163
01:57:55,541 --> 01:57:59,333
Don't get me wrong.
- Enough Karan

1164
01:57:59,334 --> 01:58:02,957
You need not say anything more

1165
01:58:02,958 --> 01:58:08,000
Need not say anything more

1166
01:58:38,375 --> 01:58:41,208
From the outset
I never liked that Mihir

1167
01:58:41,209 --> 01:58:44,708
He was always evading questions
How annoying

1168
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:48,333
What makes you laugh?
- I'm not laughing Bobby

1169
01:58:48,334 --> 01:58:51,708
You've been laughing at me forever
on the sly. Sarcastically

1170
01:58:52,708 --> 01:58:58,333
Where are you going with those
Huge bags? Our flight is next week

1171
01:58:58,334 --> 01:59:02,834
What happened, my child?

1172
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:14,291
I'm leaving

1173
01:59:14,292 --> 01:59:18,500
I don't know where
...for how long

1174
01:59:20,583 --> 01:59:30,667
For four years I kept you away from
your country, your relatives

1175
01:59:32,625 --> 01:59:36,500
This time I want to go away alone

1176
01:59:39,209 --> 01:59:46,792
I want to come to terms with
my life, with myself, on my own

1177
01:59:48,875 --> 01:59:52,292
Let me be on my own Mamma, please

1178
02:00:00,708 --> 02:00:03,874
Rhea my child...

1179
02:00:03,875 --> 02:00:08,000
home for me is wherever you are

1180
02:00:08,667 --> 02:00:14,125
I'll never even ask you
why we're going or where

1181
02:00:15,167 --> 02:00:18,667
But don't tear yourself away from me

1182
02:00:20,708 --> 02:00:23,666
I'm coming with you. Period

1183
02:00:23,667 --> 02:00:27,999
Wait, I'm coming

1184
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,332
My darling baby

1185
02:00:31,333 --> 02:00:36,500
God can't be everywhere.
That's why He made mothers

1186
02:00:45,416 --> 02:00:48,832
Have you finished your breakfast?

1187
02:00:48,833 --> 02:00:51,457
What's the matter? It's been two days

1188
02:00:51,458 --> 02:00:54,290
and you're completely uncommunicative

1189
02:00:54,291 --> 02:00:58,000
And there's no news of Rhea.
Have the two of you had a fight?

1190
02:01:04,708 --> 02:01:09,542
This boy is too much

1191
02:01:19,333 --> 02:01:20,707
You're not listening, you aren't talking,

1192
02:01:20,708 --> 02:01:23,582
you aren't answering phones, doorbells

1193
02:01:23,583 --> 02:01:26,499
Just like your Daddy

1194
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:29,124
Whose son is he after all?

1195
02:01:29,125 --> 02:01:31,749
You...?

1196
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:36,083
Can I come in?

1197
02:01:45,333 --> 02:01:48,249
What are you doing here?
- Coming directly from the airport...

1198
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:53,208
to see you. How have
you been? - I'm fine

1199
02:01:53,917 --> 02:01:59,875
It shows. How's Rhea?
- What do you want to ask?

1200
02:02:03,375 --> 02:02:07,834
I want to know why you're running
away from your life. Like I did

1201
02:02:10,542 --> 02:02:14,708
What...? - In my personal life...

1202
02:02:14,959 --> 02:02:19,332
I took a lot of wrong decisions
which I have come to regret

1203
02:02:19,333 --> 02:02:23,708
I had the loveliest, the most
loving wife in the whole world

1204
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:28,374
But I never could understand her

1205
02:02:28,375 --> 02:02:33,875
Finally I realized how much
I had been given and what I had lost

1206
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,792
Every father wants his son to follow
in his footsteps.

1207
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,667
I must be... the first father in the
whole world who prays everyday...

1208
02:02:49,084 --> 02:02:52,707
may my son never become like me

1209
02:02:52,708 --> 02:02:55,249
But sometimes when I look at you...

1210
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:59,375
I fear I may have passed on to you
my legacy of failures.

1211
02:03:00,333 --> 02:03:03,542
I fear... you may lose faith in relationships
because of me

1212
02:03:05,166 --> 02:03:08,750
But then I look at Rhea
and my fears are allayed

1213
02:03:09,375 --> 02:03:12,875
I feel she's the one who can extricate
my son from the orbs of my shadows

1214
02:03:14,166 --> 02:03:18,708
Rhea called me in Paris yesterday
to tell me that she's leaving forever

1215
02:03:20,875 --> 02:03:24,582
She'd say no more but I realized

1216
02:03:24,583 --> 02:03:27,165
you've proven that you're my son

1217
02:03:27,166 --> 02:03:30,583
No one else could ever break
a heart so full of love

1218
02:03:31,542 --> 02:03:39,083
Dad I'm in love with Rhea.
But how can she love a guy like me

1219
02:03:39,667 --> 02:03:44,500
It's what we fail to grasp about women.
How can they love morons like us?

1220
02:03:45,917 --> 02:03:50,625
17 years ago, I broke someone's heart;
someone I ought to have worshipped

1221
02:03:51,208 --> 02:03:56,165
God never gave me a second chance

1222
02:03:56,166 --> 02:03:57,916
You're about to make the same mistake.

1223
02:03:57,917 --> 02:04:04,083
Know it, He won't give you a next chance

1224
02:04:15,875 --> 02:04:18,791
Karan, where are you going?

1225
02:04:18,792 --> 02:04:22,458
After all, I'm your son Dad. In matters
of the heart I'm slow on the uptake

1226
02:04:23,333 --> 02:04:27,542
But now that I know, I'm not wasting
17 years trying to find her

1227
02:04:37,542 --> 02:04:42,500
The second chance God never gives.
We ought to seize it ourselves...

1228
02:04:43,542 --> 02:04:47,290
like my son is doing

1229
02:04:47,291 --> 02:04:52,000
Like our son...?

1230
02:04:56,458 --> 02:04:59,374
"For 3 hours we've been only 2 inches
apart

1231
02:04:59,375 --> 02:05:00,833
and we don't know each other"

1232
02:05:00,834 --> 02:05:03,958
"You rifled my bag?"

1233
02:05:03,959 --> 02:05:09,916
"Why must you spend on my tickets?
- Yes, how are we related?"

1234
02:05:09,917 --> 02:05:15,083
"You're organizing the wedding
and you don't know who the bride is?"

1235
02:05:15,375 --> 02:05:20,334
"Sameer is no longer part of my life"

1236
02:05:21,291 --> 02:05:24,667
"But to start afresh
one needs a good companion"

1237
02:05:24,875 --> 02:05:28,709
"In the end Hum-Tum might
end up falling in love"

1238
02:05:31,375 --> 02:05:34,500
"I only want to see you happy.
- You think I'll be happy with Mihir?"

1239
02:05:34,709 --> 02:05:36,999
"Will you be happy with a guy like me?"

1240
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:40,207
"Mention me after the kids and Tommy

1241
02:05:40,208 --> 02:05:43,667
and I'll hack you into small bits...
and I'll feed you to Tommy."

1242
02:05:43,917 --> 02:05:48,000
"Okay I'm sorry. No more kids-or-Tommy"

1243
02:05:48,375 --> 02:05:54,208
"I'll always love you
more than anyone else"

1244
02:06:20,208 --> 02:06:22,874
"Sometimes the first look is enough.

1245
02:06:22,875 --> 02:06:27,207
Sometimes it takes so many meetings"

1246
02:06:27,208 --> 02:06:35,166
xxxxxxxxxxxx

1247
02:06:48,333 --> 02:06:51,499
"Words..."

1248
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:54,541
"my eyes spoke..."

1249
02:06:54,542 --> 02:06:58,916
"had you read..."

1250
02:07:00,417 --> 02:07:10,834
"you'd never lose me..."
"you would've found love"

1251
02:07:11,958 --> 02:07:13,291
"Wait..."

1252
02:07:13,292 --> 02:07:17,584
"if that word... you ever said..."

1253
02:07:18,208 --> 02:07:24,166
"in Loneliness, we wouldn't walk"

1254
02:07:24,417 --> 02:07:30,000
"Once a moment craved... a tryst..."

1255
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:36,208
"yours and mine"

1256
02:08:11,875 --> 02:08:16,416
Only problem with Hum-Tum...
without you I'm incomplete

1257
02:08:35,041 --> 02:08:41,333
Many relationships fall apart because
people can't express themselves...

1258
02:08:41,875 --> 02:08:46,167
they can't talk their hearts out.
If you got something to tell someone...

1259
02:08:46,417 --> 02:08:51,083
just go ahead and say it.
Don't wait, it might be too late

1260
02:08:53,709 --> 02:08:56,332
Rhea couldn't understand
my love because...

1261
02:08:56,333 --> 02:09:01,167
I was the one who couldn't fathom
my love. Now she's gone...

1262
02:09:03,208 --> 02:09:08,584
and I never got a chance
to express myself. Out of this book...

1263
02:09:09,958 --> 02:09:16,292
I seek no riches, no fame.
I only want to tell her...

1264
02:09:17,667 --> 02:09:22,541
how much I love her

1265
02:09:25,208 --> 02:09:28,708
You believe you'll meet her again?

1266
02:09:28,709 --> 02:09:33,208
She will meet me. I'm sure...
because life's a long while

1267
02:09:56,208 --> 02:09:58,041
Rain in January...?

1268
02:09:58,042 --> 02:10:03,542
It doesn't rain in January

1269
02:10:18,584 --> 02:10:22,958
It was bound to happen, yes Karan?
Because whenever we've met...

1270
02:10:23,667 --> 02:10:28,458
something always happens

1271
02:10:28,708 --> 02:10:32,374
You read the book?

1272
02:10:32,375 --> 02:10:35,790
How did you like it?

1273
02:10:35,791 --> 02:10:40,416
Reminded me of a friend

1274
02:10:40,417 --> 02:10:43,459
Ever told you about this friend of mine?

1275
02:10:45,125 --> 02:10:47,707
Never

1276
02:10:47,708 --> 02:10:49,749
I met him long years ago

1277
02:10:49,750 --> 02:10:52,207
And you kept seeing him...

1278
02:10:52,208 --> 02:10:55,124
till he became my best friend

1279
02:10:55,125 --> 02:11:00,542
Then he fell in love with you.
Why did you walk away?

1280
02:11:01,208 --> 02:11:05,499
Because he didn't stop me

1281
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:08,207
I don't like your friend one bit

1282
02:11:08,208 --> 02:11:11,500
Not a word against my friend

1283
02:11:12,875 --> 02:11:16,624
Then what do I say?

1284
02:11:16,625 --> 02:11:18,583
What you've never said

1285
02:11:18,584 --> 02:11:22,875
That I'll love you more than
the kids and Tommy?

1286
02:11:23,375 --> 02:11:26,875
You better! Else I'll cut you
into little bits...

1287
02:12:04,042 --> 02:12:11,167
I told you, there's one story about us.
- Is this the end of our story?

1288
02:12:11,417 --> 02:12:15,916
No, now's when our story begins

1289
02:12:15,917 --> 02:12:20,125
Where are you going?
You didn't hear what he said?

1290
02:12:20,417 --> 02:12:26,042
Story isn't over

1291
02:12:43,625 --> 02:12:48,124
Who's this guy?

1292
02:12:48,125 --> 02:12:51,124
Why is his cot so close
to my daughter's?

1293
02:12:51,125 --> 02:12:54,249
He's a new-born!
- You never know these guys

1294
02:12:54,250 --> 02:12:57,833
No sooner than they're born
they start flirting with pretty girls

1295
02:13:00,917 --> 02:13:02,832
Saw that...?

1296
02:13:02,833 --> 02:13:09,291
He's using kids' sign language
to call my daughter

1297
02:13:10,958 --> 02:13:13,208
If he's like that
I wonder what his mother's like

1298
02:13:13,209 --> 02:13:16,333
When did you see his mother?
- Just a joke

1299
02:13:16,334 --> 02:13:20,124
When did you see his mother?

1300
02:13:20,125 --> 02:13:24,709
Look, your baby is cute.

1301
02:13:25,209 --> 02:13:28,957
When did you see his mother?
- I saw his dad. Doesn't resemble him

1302
02:13:28,958 --> 02:13:33,667
I thought he must resemble his mother

1303
02:13:37,708 --> 02:13:39,082
You and I...

1304
02:13:39,083 --> 02:13:49,000
xxxxxxxxxxxx

1305
02:13:50,292 --> 02:13:55,542
"Because I love you"

1306
02:14:01,375 --> 02:14:05,583
"Boys get together and go out
Girls get together and chat"

1307
02:14:08,042 --> 02:14:09,707
"How will we get together?"

1308
02:14:09,708 --> 02:14:15,458
"Deep in my heart, you and l"

1309
02:14:28,458 --> 02:14:32,750
"Day longs of longings
whenever you're nowhere near"

1310
02:14:33,167 --> 02:14:37,665
"Who all were you with?

1311
02:14:37,666 --> 02:14:39,624
"So if you love me?"

1312
02:14:39,625 --> 02:14:43,792
"Why didn't you profess your love
and you fought me off?"

1313
02:14:44,125 --> 02:14:49,542
"Now come into my arms"
