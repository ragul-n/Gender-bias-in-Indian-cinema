1
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:21,143
20 years back.

2
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:26,551
Chengalpet

3
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,368
it's been very long time we met.
- Yes.

4
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,702
Is he your daughter's son?
- My son's son.

5
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,349
It's time for the auspicious hour. Bring the bride.

6
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,447
Excuse me.

7
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,051
Krishna, come with the bride, run.

8
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:54,982
Krishna, come near me.

9
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,137
Slowly.

10
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,108
Sumathi, if you don't make it fast,

11
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,576
the groom will marry some other girl.

12
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,078
Did he say so?

13
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,911
Then no other go. You must marry me.

14
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,953
I proposed to you long back. But you weren't interested,

15
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,282
look at the way he's taking.

16
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,753
An apt name.

17
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,928
Yes. If you don't mind, I'll even marry you.

18
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,722
Who is he?

19
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,990
My colleague's son.

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,565
Poor boy... his mother is no more.

21
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,833
Poor boy.

22
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,867
Inform them that I am coming.

23
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,437
So, you won't marry me.

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,265
Go...

25
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:56,807
move...

26
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:02,811
your aunt and uncle are calling you.
- I am coming, Ramya.

27
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,284
Come fast.

28
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,529
Ramya dear, inform your uncle that she is coming.

29
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,970
<I>Who is shouting over there?</I>

30
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,606
<I>I don't know, let's go and see.</I>

31
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,504
Leave me.
- I won't, you stupid.

32
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,076
Leave him...

33
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,082
Ramya, leave him.

34
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,886
I'll beat you.
- I won't leave you.

35
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,494
Oh god! What's happening here?

36
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,323
Get lost. Leave me.

37
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:49,029
Leave her hand & stop fighting.

38
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,998
He imitated me.

39
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,796
She pushed me down first.

40
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,769
You imitated me first.
- Leave him.

41
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,999
Why're you fighting with me?

42
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,404
Leave his hand keep quiet.

43
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,507
I'll beat you.

44
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,677
Get up, come.

45
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,280
It's time for the auspicious hour.
- Come. - lets go.

46
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,279
Don't fight.

47
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,919
You stupid.

48
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:45,520
<I>From the day I saw you,</I> <I>my love for you kept growing.</I>

49
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:56,897
<I>From the day I saw you,</I> <I>my love for you kept growing.</I>

50
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:02,735
<I>The day I saw you,</I> <I>Lord Murugan holding a spear,</I>

51
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:10,110
<I>my love for you kept growing,</I>

52
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:42,612
<I>with musical buzz of bees in</I> <I>the garden of eden...</I>

53
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:48,682
<I>I saw you my Lord,</I> <I>the divine charmer.</I>

54
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,957
<I>With musical buzz of bees in</I> <I>the garden of eden...</I>

55
00:04:54,227 --> 00:05:00,689
<I>I saw you my Lord,</I> <I>the divine charmer.</I>

56
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,133
<I>From the day I saw you.</I> <I>My love for you kept growing.</I>

57
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,202
<I>The day I saw you,</I> <I>Lord Murugan holding a spear,</I>

58
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:19,614
<I>from the day I saw you,</I> <I>my love for you kept growing.</I>

59
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:42,066
5 years back.

60
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,540
Erode

61
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,510
Wow! Girl in T-shirt. Saw Krishna?
- Stupid. It's you.

62
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,443
Move.

63
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,085
Hey you! Where is Krishna?
- He's down there.

64
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,083
Beautiful.

65
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,855
Absolutely gorgeous.

66
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,081
An important matter, Krishna,

67
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,528
I am busy now. We can talk later.
- Very very important.

68
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,289
Look at her. She is a 1st year student.

69
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,829
Just look at the wonderful job she has done.

70
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,900
Why're you always after me?

71
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,367
Sorry Krishna. Hereafter, I'll go after her.

72
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,201
Preethi... Preetha.
- Yes Preetha.

73
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,401
It would like nice if you apply fluorescent colour.

74
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,546
Krishna... - what's your problem?

75
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,712
I am running from pillar to post to conduct culturals successfully. Go...

76
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,181
okay, you're the only one who does everything.

77
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,787
Then, solve the Ethiraj college girls problem too.

78
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,286
I'll meet you later.
- Really?

79
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,822
What's their problem?

80
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,959
Excuse me Preethi.
- Preetha. I mean the same.

81
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,129
You leech.
- Leech.

82
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,525
You forget everyone on seeing a girl.
- What's the problem?

83
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,757
We booked a bus to pick up Ethiraj college girls, didn't we?

84
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,230
The bus broke down.
- Oh my god!

85
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,233
There were no spare bus or van with the travel agency.

86
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,271
I called Sangeetha's uncle, Erode municipality councillor,

87
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,932
and asked him to send us a vehicle urgently.

88
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,446
Well done, good quick thinking. Why do you call it a fiasco?

89
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,707
What good thinking?

90
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,080
You should've seen the bus he sent.
- What happened?

91
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,514
How will I say that?
- Come on, tell me.

92
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,690
That vehicle.

93
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,288
I'll kill them.

94
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,556
Don't get angry.

95
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,996
Would anyone do this intentionally?

96
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,798
What are you talking, madam?

97
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,071
They've done this to insult us.

98
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,733
If I get hold those college students,

99
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,836
I'll take wind out of their sails.

100
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,006
<I>Krishna, they are here.</I>

101
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,844
<I>Oh my god!</I>

102
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,754
<I>girls look beautiful</I> <I>even before taking shower.</I>

103
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,422
Hi... - and you?

104
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,591
I am culturals secretary.

105
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:45,158
Sorry for the inconvenience. The bus broke down. So, we sent this bus.

106
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:45,921
Extremely sorry.

107
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,690
Can your sorry correct things up?

108
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,028
What do you think of yourself.

109
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,727
By sending such a vehicle.

110
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,100
That's why, I am here to seek your forgiveness.

111
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,300
A small mistake.
- What? A small mistake?

112
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,502
We couldn't get any other bus.

113
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,270
Say something we can believe,

114
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,246
would anyone do this intentionally?
- Yes, you did it intentionally.

115
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,884
We are going to blow it into a big issue.

116
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,082
We want to meet your principal immediately,

117
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,983
and ask him to arrange our return tickets.

118
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,591
We want to meet your vice chancellor.
- Oh no. Please come here.

119
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,920
I swear, we didn't do it intentionally.

120
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,824
In fact, beautiful girls like you coming to our college is a boon to us.

121
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:19,656
You tell her.

122
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,356
Show me your hand, I will promise.

123
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,467
Please explain it to your teacher.

124
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,802
I am the teacher. She's my student Ramya.

125
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,839
Teacher is looking so beautiful. Unbelievable.
- Yes.

126
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,067
You haven't cracked any joke, right?

127
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,341
Whatever happened <I>here...</I>
- Ramya, come here.

128
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,845
They look good even without taking bath

129
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,277
poor guys.

130
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,183
If we go back, it's an insult to us.
- Yes.

131
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,411
We'll make sure that it'll never happen again.

132
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,188
Sorry.

133
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,651
Everything is okay.
- Thank you madam.

134
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,722
And your name?
- Krishna.

135
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,861
I wanted to tell you my name. But that Hitler never allowed me to speak.

136
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,897
Stop talking & get our bags.
- I'll do it.

137
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,901
Are all Ramyas the same?

138
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,570
Are all Krishnas the same?

139
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,771
You stubborn devil.
- What did you say?

140
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,805
What are you murmuring?
- Nothing.

141
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,179
Not only your bag, I'll even lift you & take to hostel.

142
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,911
That can happen only after I am dead.

143
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,948
Even I meant the same, you crack.

144
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:12,879
What?

145
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,878
Take it.

146
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,557
<I>It's already late.</I> <I>- Stop lamenting, we'll surely go.</I>

147
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,523
2 handsome boys are waiting.

148
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:27,131
Come and register for the light classical competition.

149
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,092
Looks like she is going to participate, watch.

150
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,573
We've come to participate in the light classical competition.
- Sure.

151
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,677
Do you also sing Sunita? Superb.
- Not me, it's Ramya.

152
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,977
Her voice doesn't sound nice for singing.

153
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,672
What do you know about me?
- Ramya, please keep quiet.

154
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,681
Who knows what talent is buried in each one of us.

155
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,880
Your name?
- Ramya Shankaran.

156
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:50,953
Id please.

157
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,855
<I>Attention please.</I>

158
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,561
<I>Classical competition is about</I> <I>to start in a few minutes.</I>

159
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,364
I kept it in this bag only.
- Look properly.

160
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,194
It's missing.

161
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,434
Have you kept it in the room?

162
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:07,764
I don't know.

163
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,135
Only 5 minutes are left, Ramya.

164
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,073
By the time you find your id in your hostel room,

165
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,678
we'll close the registration.

166
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,446
What a pity!

167
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,279
She has come here all the way to participate in this competition.

168
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,781
We feel sorry for her not participating in that competition too.

169
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,622
<I>We're helpless.</I>

170
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:27,991
Please.

171
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,954
She has touched my heart.

172
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:30,924
Forget it, Sunita.

173
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,427
Such an incident occurred even yesterday.

174
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,399
An I.I.t. Girl didn't have her id card.

175
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,669
They never allowed her in.

176
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,594
She begged them so much.

177
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,565
But our cultural secretary never allowed her.

178
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,607
Neither they allowed her to participate in the competition.

179
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,641
Nor gave her any prize.

180
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,746
Hello... trying to tease us.

181
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,773
Do you know what had happened yesterday?
- I know.

182
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,794
Come on guys, stop it.

183
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,828
What's it Krishna?
- Sorry, no id. No competition.

184
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:11,436
Krishna, you were never so rude to girls.
- You're right.

185
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,899
I'll never be rude with girls.

186
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,970
Excuse me, why're you talking disrespectfully?

187
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,198
What bothers you?

188
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,933
What's your problem? Wait a minute.

189
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:22,771
Krishna, if you don't allow her to participate in the competition.

190
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,882
We girls are boycotting. What do you say girls?
- Yeah.

191
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,745
Yes, boycott and go to Mudhumalai forest.

192
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,443
Don't talk too much.
- Okay.

193
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,322
Let her participate.
- Yeah.

194
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,792
I don't need your mercy.

195
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,693
Are you scared of losing?
- No.

196
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,689
If I win I'm more bothered about you losing face.

197
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,698
Only if you win?

198
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,629
If I win.

199
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,603
Our <I>next</I> participant is Ramya shankaran from Ethiraj college.

200
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,541
All the best.
- Do well.

201
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,680
There she goes.

202
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,122
Oh god! She mustn't sing well.

203
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,891
The great M.S. Subbulakshmi has come to our college.

204
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,703
I feel giddy.

205
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,465
What about you?
- I feel like falling in love.

206
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,244
Ladies and gentlemen,

207
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,208
keep eggs and tomatoes ready.

208
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,813
Keep them ready to throw them on him.

209
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:30,982
You'll never reform.

210
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,314
<I>From the day I saw you,</I>

211
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,251
<I>my love for you kept growing.</I>

212
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,153
<I>From the day I saw you,</I>

213
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,988
<I>my love for you kept growing.</I>

214
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:49,828
<I>From the day I saw you,</I> <I>my love for you kept growing.</I>

215
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:55,598
<I>The day I saw you,</I> <I>Lord Murugan holding a spear,</I>

216
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,002
<I>from the day I saw you,</I>

217
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,441
<I>my love for him kept growing.</I>

218
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:07,176
<I>The day I saw you,</I> <I>Lord Murugan holding a spear,</I>

219
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:13,018
<I>my love for him kept growing.</I>

220
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:18,857
<I>The day I saw you,</I> <I>Lord Murugan holding a spear,</I>

221
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,624
<I>my love for him kept growing.</I>

222
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,198
Sorry for the delay in announcing the results.

223
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,571
All participate performed well in light classical competition.

224
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,645
3rd prize goes to Parthasarathy of Hindustan engineering college.

225
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,983
2nd prize goes to Sumathi of IIT, Bombay.

226
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,059
And the 1st prize goes to...

227
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,062
Parvathi of IIT, madras.

228
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,112
Thank you.

229
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:14,648
Culturals are organised for everyone to participate.

230
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,581
It isn't about talent or prizes.

231
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:19,923
It's about participation.

232
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:27,766
We over come our shyness & live our desires in such cultural programmes.

233
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,525
Based on that,

234
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,762
I am going to announce, special consolation prize for this competition.

235
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,168
And the prize goes to Ramya Shankaran.

236
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:39,438
Krishna.

237
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,279
Ramya dear...

238
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:46,617
sorry.

239
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,120
Ramya Shankaran of Ethiraj Chennai.

240
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,118
So, it's you.

241
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,718
Give her a big hand. Come on...

242
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,856
though she is only a bathroom singer,

243
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,866
we must appreciate her courage to sing on the stage.

244
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,204
In fact, she doesn't even have her college id card.

245
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,600
Krishna... still the same old brat boy?

246
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,672
Excuse me... - what excuse?

247
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,868
You had insulted me then & now.

248
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,978
You sang horribly on both the occasions.

249
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,204
Who? Me?

250
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,883
Ask your judge.

251
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,813
Ask him.

252
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,385
I'll complain to the principal.

253
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,716
I am not scared.
- I'll kill you.

254
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,984
I'll kill you before that.

255
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,217
You devil!
- You demon!

256
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,555
You crap!
- You're devil!

257
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:37,725
You're a crap!
- I'll break your teeth.

258
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,622
<I>I am a volcano!</I> <I>never stand in my way.</I>

259
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:07,529
<I>Save yourself from</I> <I>getting burnt to ash.</I>

260
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,867
<I>Are you a saint to curse me?</I>

261
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,040
<I>I am not scared with</I> <I>your silly threats.</I>

262
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,537
<I>If you have the guts.</I> <I>Let's fight one to one.</I>

263
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,213
<I>I am not afraid of you.</I>

264
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:29,047
<I>This is the battle field.</I> <I>And the battle starts now.</I>

265
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:32,382
<I>I am an earth quake.</I>

266
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,890
<I>No one can survive</I> <I>my devastation.</I>

267
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:42,728
<I>This is the battle field.</I> <I>And the battle starts now.</I>

268
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:46,063
<I>I am an earth quake.</I>

269
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,570
<I>No one can survive</I> <I>my devastation.</I>

270
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:55,714
<I>I am a volcano.</I> <I>Never stand in my way.</I>

271
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:03,079
<I>Save yourself from</I> <I>getting burnt to ash.</I>

272
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,952
<I>You are an arrogant girl.</I>

273
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,618
<I>Talking to you is like getting</I> <I>my head pound in a mortar.</I>

274
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,951
<I>A little worm considers</I> <I>himself to be a lion.</I>

275
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,288
<I>It's hiding behind</I> <I>the shrub in fear.</I>

276
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,793
<I>Come and challenge my brilliance.</I>

277
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,297
<I>You're no match to my beauty.</I>

278
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,971
<I>You're a scarecrow.</I>

279
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:54,798
<I>When you're here,</I>

280
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:58,135
<I>why buy a pumpkin to</I> <I>ward off the evil eyes?</I>

281
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:05,078
<I>This is the battle field.</I> <I>And the battle starts now.</I>

282
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,481
<I>I am an earth quake.</I>

283
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,986
<I>No one can survive</I> <I>my devastation.</I>

284
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:17,823
<I>I am a volcano.</I> <I>Never stand in my way.</I>

285
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:24,936
<I>Save yourself from</I> <I>getting burnt to ash.</I>

286
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,714
<I>All your hard earned money</I> <I>will get robbed.</I>

287
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:19,714
<I>I'll never hesitate to spend</I> <I>all my earnings to destroy you.</I>

288
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,120
<I>You'll fail in your studies</I> <I>and in your job.</I>

289
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,890
<I>You'll lose wealth</I> <I>and relatives.</I>

290
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,226
<I>The day will come when you'll be</I> <I>seen begging on the streets.</I>

291
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:36,067
<I>This is the battle field.</I> <I>And the battle starts now.</I>

292
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,403
<I>I am an earth quake.</I>

293
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:43,069
<I>No one can survive</I> <I>my devastation.</I>

294
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,798
Today! Present...

295
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,436
Chennai.

296
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,103
4th floor.

297
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,781
Ms. Ramya, you've applied for leave, haven't you?

298
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,510
You can take it. No problem.

299
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,948
Our company insists on quality work.

300
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:25,782
Thank you, sir.

301
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,056
Gio for women? - <I>Sir...</I>

302
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,192
I meant the perfume.

303
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,123
No sir, this is Jeeva soap.

304
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:39,134
Wow! Just like Simran. Very good.

305
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,071
Sister...

306
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,817
who is she?
- My sister Lata.

307
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,813
Wow! Very good... very nice.

308
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,319
Very important matter. That's why, I've come to see her.

309
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,491
Is it? Finish your talk,

310
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,989
I'll wait for you in the conference hall.

311
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,094
Okay, see you bye...

312
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,760
what bought you here? What's the matter?

313
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,092
Solomon has come here.

314
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,666
Where is he?
- Over there.

315
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:12,829
<I>What is he doing here?</I>

316
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,102
What do you want me to do?

317
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,671
You must talk to our parents, make them agree for our marriage.

318
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,441
Me? No way.

319
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:27,848
Sister.

320
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,348
If you had the guts to love him for 6 years.

321
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,182
You must also have the guts to tell it to our parents.

322
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,415
Ramya sister, please.

323
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,190
Call me sister for all these.

324
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,453
Do something?

325
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:38,521
Ramya sister...

326
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,858
what did you say? Sister?

327
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,932
I got over <I>excited...</I>

328
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,204
I won't help you, for this reason alone.

329
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,697
Why the hell did you say sister?

330
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:49,498
What else do you want me to say?

331
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,381
Dad, I want to talk to you.

332
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,382
<I>How long will you take</I> <I>to clean the rice?</I>

333
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:05,147
Mother, I want to talk to you.
- Come fast.

334
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,018
Dad...

335
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,060
Ramya, what are you doing?

336
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,562
I said I want to talk to you.

337
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:15,558
Mother...

338
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,570
who is that? What are you doing?

339
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,671
I want to discuss an important matter. Come out.

340
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,006
You sit.
- Toilet.

341
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:24,903
Go later.

342
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,577
Lata, come here.

343
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,746
To toilet... - later.

344
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,244
Why're you ordering us like a headmistress?

345
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,074
What do you want to talk?

346
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,511
Is it promotion or your transfer?

347
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,515
Make it fast. I've to cook.

348
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,980
First sit.

349
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,313
Quick. It's time for news updates.

350
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,857
T.v. And cooking. Don't you know anything other than this?

351
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,187
You're there for the rest.

352
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,330
Shut up. Don't interrupt me.

353
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,196
I should've discussed about it long back.

354
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,276
But I am forced to discuss it now.

355
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,203
What I am trying to convey <I>is...</I>

356
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:12,348
I think, you've forgot about 2 grown up girls in this home.

357
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,618
If this situation continues...

358
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,792
...you can't blame those girls.

359
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,234
If the parents aren't responsible,

360
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,466
what can their children do?

361
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,629
So if someone elopes with some boy,

362
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,306
you can't blame us.

363
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,808
Why? Are you planning to elope with someone?

364
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,344
Me? Oh no!
- Then is it you?

365
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,640
Oh mom, what are you talking?

366
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,985
If we come to know about it,

367
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,814
we'll lock you in the room.

368
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,153
Why are you making me a partner to it?

369
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,916
Ramya, tell us what do you've in your mind?

370
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,490
How many times should I tell you?

371
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,061
But nothing gets into your brain.
- What?

372
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:57,597
We're also interested in having our own family, kids...

373
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,333
why don't you understand that?

374
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,835
What do you want to say?

375
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,007
What's it?

376
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,268
Still didn't get her?

377
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,844
Poor Ramya. What can she do?

378
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,009
I should've told this to you.

379
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,181
Making her talk about it is wrong?

380
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,853
I'll tell you.

381
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,189
You must perform her marriage.

382
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,692
She couldn't find a partner by herself.

383
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,862
You haven't taken any steps.

384
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,328
What can she do? Poor girl.

385
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,029
I told her. Don't worry, sister.

386
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,200
Mother...

387
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,238
please forgive me.

388
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,470
You've so many ideas in your heart.

389
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:46,045
What's this? We couldn't understand her.

390
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,845
We'll find a prince charming for you, don't worry.

391
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:52,881
Please forgive, dear.

392
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,685
Forgive me, dear.

393
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,262
Hi Prathyusha.
- Hi, any phone calls?

394
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,097

395
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,272
I've got more important thing than that.
- Wait... wait...

396
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,872
you buy 2 bouquets.

397
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,508
Krishna, please.
- Morning.
- Hi,

398
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,904
there are two addresses in this.

399
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,635
Sheetal and Amni.
- But...

400
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,239
Sheetal, I am sorry, send how about today to Amni.

401
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,940
Yeah but I want to tell you something.

402
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,948
Oh! It's how about today to Sheetal and sorry to Amni.

403
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,279
Hi to Sheetal and bye to Amni.

404
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,012
Hi girls!
- Good morning.

405
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,784
Ramani madam has made 31 calls, I've been avoiding her calls.

406
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,427
You don't tell them.
- Sir, they're inside only.

407
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,060
Why didn't you tell me that before?
- You never let me tell you.

408
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,130
Okay... okay...

409
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,001
Hi Ramani madam.

410
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:42,795
How are you?

411
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,872
Have you come to see how I run your son's office?

412
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,805
I've a very important meeting I came for a file.

413
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,381
File?
- It is in that room I'll get it for you.

414
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,641
Just get it. Hurry up.

415
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,783
<I>Krishna escape.</I>

416
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:56,812
Got trapped.

417
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,216
Krishna, stop.

418
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,156
Why're you just walking away?

419
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,991
Aravind has entrusted me with great responsibility.

420
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:04,725
Shouldn't I be loyal to him?

421
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,626
Enough of being loyal to my son.

422
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,957
What's your reply for my question?

423
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,826
What is she asking about? Have you got any idea, uncle?

424
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:13,936
What's there for me to say?

425
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,972
I just come and take her out when she asks, that's all.

426
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,665
Both of you don't know anything.

427
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,868
Are you both trying to fool me?

428
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,980
What happened? What happened to Aravind's marriage?

429
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:27,015
Oh about that! Anyway he's coming from us on Saturday.

430
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,412
I'll definitely talk to him and...

431
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,848
definitely talk to him.

432
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,849
A small... a small responsibility I gave you.

433
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,085
You can't do it properly, but you talk big.

434
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,725
Why're you all watching fun?

435
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,728
Turn that side and mind your work.

436
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:42,926
This boy...

437
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:48,003
hey, aren't you both friends from childhood days?

438
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:49,930
Now, scratch your head.

439
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,403
You've to talk to him.

440
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,737
You must put some sense in him to marry.

441
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,947
Why're you laughing? That's true.

442
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:00,378
He's a motherless boy. She died when he was a little boy.

443
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,213
He always consider me as mother.

444
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,251
You've put a spade in the wheel.

445
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,447
His father is like a brother to me.

446
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,183
That's why, I made him my son's partner,

447
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,294
and invested my money to start this business.

448
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,465
He's irresponsible.
- Mother, I'll come home at 7 pm

449
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,099
let's talk then I've a meeting now, bye.

450
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,826
Always says about meeting look, how he's escaping.

451
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,598
I've found a beautiful girl for him. Please convince him.

452
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,967
<I>Evening 7 pm.</I>

453
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,869
Mad... crazy old woman.

454
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,880
She's here just to take my life.

455
00:27:58,476 --> 00:27:59,875
Why do you take so much time to open the door?

456
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,707
Why are you so irritated?

457
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,877
What does the old woman think of herself?

458
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,050
Parimala, takeover the class. <I>- Okay sister.</I>

459
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,385
She's creating problem in office. What will the staff think of me?

460
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,118
Should she talk about my childhood days with the staff?

461
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:14,052
Isn't it too much?

462
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,952
What can I do if Aravind isn't interested in marriage?

463
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,322
Why is the old woman after me?

464
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,722
What's wrong in her wish of getting Aravind married?

465
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,524
When a man reaches that age, marriage is inevitable, right?

466
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,725
Why didn't you take any step to get me married then?

467
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,528
I can, but which fool will give his daughter to you in marriage?

468
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,638
At least you could've married and settled leaving me alone.

469
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,740
Why did you sacrifice your life for me?

470
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:31,909
Did you hear it, dad?

471
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,077
Hello, I didn't sacrifice just for you only,

472
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,112
I too fell in love with a man.

473
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,545
There's a talk around that he's going to marry film star Jyothika?

474
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,013
I ditched him.

475
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,950
You made a wrong decision, sister. You should've convinced him.

476
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,689
I can't bear the old woman's tortures.

477
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,218
I promised to come at 7 pm and came here.

478
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,622
Aravind has built a bungalow in madras for her.

479
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,057
...spending time watching plays, or concerts or...

480
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,391
...doing social service, can't she enjoy her life?

481
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,292
I can't bear anymore the old woman's tortures.

482
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,665
I've heard it boy.

483
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,204
You've called me a old woman 3 times.

484
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,376
Not 3, it's 4 times.

485
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,711
Are you keeping the count?

486
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:12,373
Okay I've grown old, an old woman. Call me as you like.

487
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,643
I've grown old & nearing death.

488
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,343
Don't I've a wish to see my grand children.

489
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:17,248
Mother.

490
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,217
What happened now?

491
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,953
If you fail to make him accept this marriage,

492
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:25,959
come on, go ahead.

493
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:26,994
If you fail...

494
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,460
you'll create a bigger drama than now, won't you?

495
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:32,329
No, I'll give away all my wealth to same orphanage.

496
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,663
I'll run away.

497
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,333
Sorry, I can't run.

498
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,599
I'll join some home for the senior citizens.

499
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,243
I'll live like an orphan there.
- What's this mother?

500
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,712
I beg you my son.

501
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,975
Don't you feel you're overdoing it?
- I too feel, but I can't avoid.

502
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,914
They say we must fall at donkey's feet also to get things done.

503
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,678
I've called you a donkey, don't get angry, dear.

504
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,153
Isn't he coming on Saturday? I'll talk to him.

505
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,617
If I talk to him now, he may never come.

506
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:55,793
I'll not say a word.

507
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,462
Promise to talk to him.
- I promise.

508
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,958
Don't start lamenting as soon as you see him.

509
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,502
Don't open your mouth? Not a breath.

510
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,566
Now you'll nod your head, but on seeing you'll start talking.

511
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,335
If I open my mouth, call me by name and question me.

512
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,102
Nothing short in saying this.

513
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,506
My son Aravind.

514
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,941
My son.
- Mother.

515
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:18,843
Hi.
- Hi buddy.

516
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,781
My son! How do you do? How are you doing my son?

517
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,181
Are you taking medicines properly?

518
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,520
All my problems will get solved on seeing my daughter-in-law.
- Shall we?

519
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:29,283
Shall we?

520
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,962
Won't you listen, if I tell you?
- Go way. - talking.

521
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,835
Would you like to have a beer?
- Not now.

522
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,165
What should I tell your mother?
- What?

523
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,471
What should I tell your mother?

524
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:45,875
Shall we dance?
- Sure.

525
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:52,310
Tell her I threatened to fire you if she asks about my marriage again.

526
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,681
Aravind stop.

527
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,447
Excuse me.

528
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,885
When will you become responsible?

529
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:02,957
Spending time happily doesn't mean I am irresponsible.

530
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,688
Go! Why should I give up my freedom? I am open type.

531
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,560
Neither I cheated anyone nor got cheated.

532
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,234
I am living life on my own terms. What's wrong in it?

533
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,165
There's nothing wrong, what are we searching seriously?

534
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,463
Fan.

535
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,604
A companion, a life partner.
- It's all bogus.

536
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,300
Finding unknown girls in discotheques.

537
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,000
Sorry.

538
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,046
...better than this temporary happiness,

539
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,182
a girl who belongs to you,

540
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,715
a wife to share our joys and grieves.

541
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,887
Two children, a home, a car.

542
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,077
Going to beach every Sunday,

543
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,726
caressing her cheeks when she brings your morning coffee.

544
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,419
I can find she has more moustache and beard than me.

545
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,792
She may not have the habit of flushing after using bathroom.

546
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,401
Snoring habit in sleep... PMS, migraine, children, it's a torture.

547
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,093
You're too pessimistic.

548
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,772
Relax, I am practical.

549
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,601
How would you be after 20 years?
- Just the same.

550
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,205
What're you going to leave behind in this world?

551
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,209
Though I haven't done any good I haven't done bad either, a fair name.

552
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,813
Selfishness?
- No, freedom.

553
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,483
Depression.
- Peace.

554
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,652
Loneliness.
- No way man.

555
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,386
Instead of this, you can live happily with the girl selected by your mother.

556
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,149
<I>Okay, what about you?</I>

557
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,490
I'll settle down happily with some girl.

558
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,657
You'll spend life sadly. <I>- Get lost.</I>

559
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,913
<I>Marriage will bring</I> <I>an angel into your life.</I>

560
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,485
<I>Hell the other name</I> <I>of it, is marriage.</I>

561
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,253
<I>Why to step into hell wantonly?</I>

562
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:23,995
<I>If you tie the knot,</I> <I>she'll become all yours.</I>

563
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,170
<I>She'll be ready to give</I> <I>her life also for you.</I>

564
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,334
<I>No need of it.</I>

565
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,514
<I>To go to office early</I> <I>in the morning,</I>

566
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,689
<I>she'll send you off</I> <I>to office with a smile.</I>

567
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,851
<I>I got nothing to do with this.</I>

568
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,190
<I>Leave me... leave me alone!</I>

569
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,867
<I>why are you troubling me?</I>

570
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,703
<I>Accept... accept...</I>

571
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:02,372
<I>give your acceptance buddy.</I>

572
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,598
<I>Don't try to confuse</I> <I>and make me go mad?</I>

573
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,710
<I>Don't try to bottle me up?</I>

574
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,039
<I>When it rains we must get wet?</I>

575
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,217
<I>No need of umbrellas or clothes.</I>

576
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,545
<I>She'll wipe your wet hair.</I>

577
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,722
<I>If you get fever, she'll stay awake</I> <I>all night to nurse you.</I>

578
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,391
<I>I got nothing to do with this.</I>

579
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:51,753
<I>She smiles when you smile.</I> <I>She cries when you cry...</I>

580
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,589
<I>she'll live for you only.</I>

581
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:02,930
<I>If she smiles when I smile,</I> <I>if she cries when I cry,</I>

582
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,763
<I>are wives really mad women?</I>

583
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:10,433
<I>Your wife will take you</I> <I>to the world of ecstasy.</I>

584
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,269
<I>That's why, marriage is heaven.</I>

585
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,003
<I>Every goods in the</I> <I>shelf will be sold.</I>

586
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,705
<I>Love stands the test of time.</I>

587
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,441
<I>Birds come and join in flocks.</I>

588
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,120
<I>Changing their partners regularly.</I>

589
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:27,291
<I>Spend a life without any problem.</I>

590
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,619
<I>Accept... accept.</I>

591
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,458
<I>Give me your acceptance, buddy.</I>

592
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:40,467
<I>Leave... leave...</I> <I>leave me alone, buddy.</I>

593
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,639
<I>Flower of love will definitely</I> <I>bloom in your heart.</I>

594
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,468
<I>You'll know it one day.</I>

595
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,974
<I>It's fragrance will</I> <I>spread over you.</I>

596
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,977
<I>It'll continue for few generations.</I>

597
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:57,147
<I>Accept... accept.</I> <I>Give me your acceptance, buddy.</I>

598
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:02,816
<I>Accept... accept.</I> <I>Give me your acceptance, buddy.</I>

599
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,354
<I>Check it out.</I>

600
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,692
You are right. Hubby... say...

601
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,532
is the girl ready?

602
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:13,863
Can I call my daughter?

603
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,735
Call her, we've come to see her only, aren't we?

604
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,003
Sister.

605
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,544
Buddy, this is the moment, take a good look.

606
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,516
Proud girl.

607
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,393
Shit... shit...

608
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,790
what happened? What's the problem?

609
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,521
Reject her.
- What?

610
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,294
They'll come and ask you, reject this proposal.

611
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,468
Let's go away.

612
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:20,970
Wait, don't confuse me.

613
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,630
You said children, joy & grief, happiness and smile.

614
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,810
...a companion of our own.

615
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:30,310
I told you all that, right, but it'll not work out here... this girl...

616
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,978
this is the girl who bit my cheek.

617
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,156
I've cursed her husband to die in paralysis. No...

618
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,319
don't laugh.

619
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,488
She isn't a girl, she's a devil, a ghost.

620
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,589
She has a severe attitude problem.

621
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,491
She thinks she's always right.
- Really?

622
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,097
Yes man, don't you believe me.

623
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,896
Then, it's okay to me.
- Are you mad?

624
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,171
True, girls must have attitude.

625
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,666
Girls must be assertive.

626
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:56,840
They must have independent opinion. They mustn't accept whatever others say.

627
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,010
Fight over everything. Only then we can be equal partners in life.

628
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:04,671
Trust me. I am dead serious. I want a girl like her only.

629
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,179
She's not a girl at all.

630
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:10,008
Like B.P., ulcer, throat cancer, gastroenteritis. She is a disease.

631
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,326
Actually, I don't know, where to start...

632
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,330
I was always busy in business, laptop, travel & fun.

633
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,004
Marriage... commitment.

634
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,063
I never expected all this to happen with me.

635
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,508
Actually, I came here to say no.

636
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:34,836
But...

637
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:36,737
me too!

638
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:38,207
What?

639
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,009
So?

640
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,682
I accept. You?

641
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,584
Deal then.

642
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,185
No buddy.

643
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:57,561
You must come with me when I go out with Aravind tomorrow.

644
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:58,832
Sorry Ramya.

645
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,731
It's been 2 days since I met Solomon.

646
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,065
We are planning on a date.

647
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,903
Look, this is Solomon-Lata date and this is Solomon-Lata marriage.

648
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,078
Choose one.

649
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:09,579
Don't blabber.

650
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,073
Did you see Krishna?

651
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:17,251
Won't he tell bad about me with Aravind? No way.

652
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,421
Don't be stupid.

653
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,684
Aravind likes you and you like Aravind.

654
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,589
What else do you want?

655
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:30,094
You're more worried & talk about Krishna than Aravind.

656
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:34,203
No, I must prove Krishna wrong.

657
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,599
So, you must come.

658
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,335
You must ensure he doesn't create any problem.

659
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,100
And also ensure that I don't react to it.

660
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,439
You can't marry unless, I marry first, can you?

661
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:48,607
Now decide, date or marriage?
- Okay, I will come.

662
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,213
Thank you.

663
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,055
Where are we going?

664
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:03,058
Where shall we go?

665
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,796
As you please.

666
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:06,765
No, you decide.

667
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,736
I don't know much, you decide.

668
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,908
What type of food you love? Chinese or Italian?

669
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,251
Let's go to your favourite place.

670
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,086
I asked your choice first.

671
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:28,421
Actually, you decide I'll abide by your decisions.

672
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,489
You tell your choice buddy, king of madras.

673
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,596
Shall we go to watch a film after lunch?
- Great!

674
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,425
Then, let's go to Maayajaal.

675
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,830
Maayajaal? That's a...

676
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,504
that's a...

677
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,666
nothing, good idea.

678
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,443
Let's go there.
- Where is it?

679
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,212
On ECR road, Taramani road.

680
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:56,784
Taramani? On that road you...

681
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,718
sorry... I got confused.

682
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,126
Thank you.

683
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,002
Nice, isn't it?

684
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:17,398
Wow!

685
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,203
There's bowling up stairs, shall I book?

686
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:23,980
Okay, yeah.

687
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,081
Order a Bhelpuri for me.
- Yeah sure.

688
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,307
Krishna, I'll also join you.

689
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,414
Your sister has changed a lot after the accident, hasn't she? Poor girl.
- Yes.

690
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,486
Accident? What accident?

691
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,820
Didn't she meet with any accident?

692
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,153
I thought a water tank had hit her, and she has lost her balance,

693
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:44,596
and became a cousin of apostle of peace, mother Theresa.

694
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,333
What would you like to have?

695
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:49,834
Anything is okay.

696
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,904
Look at her.

697
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,508
She's nodding her head and accepting everything with a smile.

698
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,008
What would you like to have?

699
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,509
Get me poison with your hands.

700
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,574
I'll take the poison and die happily on your lap.

701
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,683
Really?
- Yes.

702
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:07,187
Love, tradition, affection, patience are essentials.

703
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:10,356
Not the food.
- You're an angel.

704
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:11,854
But you're my god.

705
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,257
Come, let's throw sand on our heads.

706
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,029
One naan please.

707
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:17,925
What's happening here?

708
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,260
Don't bore me, come Krishna.

709
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:25,034
I've got it, your sister is like a political party.

710
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,210
She's going to change attitudes like changing ruling parties.

711
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,043
Aravind is going to face the music marrying her innocently.

712
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,711
But he may not know about a lady Veerappan in his bedroom.

713
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:34,885
Popcorns.

714
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,481
Enough Krishna.

715
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,383
She's already in jitters thinking you would've complained against her.

716
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:40,715
You stay out.

717
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,723
Because our lives are hinged on this marriage, got it?

718
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:44,394
How?

719
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,227
I love a boy.

720
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,657
We're planning to marry after Ramya's marriage.

721
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,569
Okay, come out like that... congratulations.

722
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,733
But, why're you confusing yourself joining both issues?

723
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,132
What did you say the boy's name is?

724
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:00,410
Solomon.
- Solomon? Cool.

725
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,677
Why don't you elope with Solomon and marry him?

726
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,473
Will anyone wait for things like this?

727
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,550
If you want I'll come and sign as witness for your marriage.

728
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,251
Why're you forcing your sister into marriage for it?

729
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:15,180
We're trying our level best to keep our parents from getting hurt.

730
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,355
So, all this drama is for you.

731
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,652
No, for our entire family.

732
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,441
How long you've been in us?

733
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:32,438
About 7 years.

734
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,776
Respect for her is increasing but...

735
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:39,774
Aravind is clever.

736
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,111
Doormat type wives don't suit him.

737
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:43,948
You don't interfere in it, please.

738
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,280
I am serious.

739
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,290
I've nothing to lose.

740
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,652
Let her be happy wherever she might be.

741
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:53,955
Be happy wherever you are.

742
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,569
Thanks.
- Welcome. But why?

743
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:10,944
To judge anyone, if there's only one to seek help,

744
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,116
trust me, I'll never come to you.
- Why?

745
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,449
Look at her.

746
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,483
You gave me scares saying she's a dare devil.

747
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,787
I think she'll cry aloud if anyone sneezes loudly.

748
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,423
All this is to impress you.
- No way.

749
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,592
She doesn't have an independent opinion for anything.

750
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,259
Accepting whatever as it is.

751
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:27,822
She's going to tail me in Atlanta and make me go crazy.

752
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,957
She isn't the happening girl.
- Hold on man.

753
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:34,168
She's an over ambitious, assertive girl who advises everyone around.

754
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:38,501
When I called my friend informally, she took me to task.

755
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,412
Ramya, come here girl.

756
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,604
Look... look...

757
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,112
sit here.

758
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:48,743
Come.

759
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:54,122
Krishna & I've a disagreement over an administrative problem.

760
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,621
You're also a working profession, I am asking your opinion.

761
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,820
I feel if I fire all the women working in my office,

762
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,458
the overall efficiency will improve.

763
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:07,429
Why?

764
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:11,771
Girls spend half of their time in polishing nails and gossiping.

765
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,340
The other half is spent in the toilets.

766
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:18,739
If I fire all girls & give jobs to boys, efficiency will improve.

767
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,679
You're a working woman, will you agree with him?

768
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,451
I'm unable to decide.

769
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:25,349
Then listen this.

770
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,850
If they work late in office, they need a companion to drop at home,

771
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,151
then a whole lot of complaints about men ogling them,

772
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:33,858
they go on maternity leaves for 3 or 4 month.

773
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:34,996
Why all this crap?

774
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,600
Tell him Ramya if men behave properly why such complaints will raise.

775
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,861
Why're you blaming only women for pregnancy?

776
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,197
Aren't men also responsible for it?

777
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,904
You can argue like that also but I can't decide.

778
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,203
I'm giving you a lead, pick it up, mad girl.

779
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:52,345
I don't have any personal opinion on it.

780
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,073
What happened to equality & feminism?

781
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:59,351
Okay, few jobs like public relations, other than girls can men do it?

782
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:00,386
Tell him Ramya.

783
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,384
I'm little confused.

784
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:10,524
Okay Ramya, you'll be in a confused state.

785
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,492
Women's IQ is low.

786
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:13,703
It is written in the genetic code.

787
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,771
Intelligence and talent levels is low, keep them in kitchens only.

788
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,500
Isn't it funny?

789
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,309
Didn't I tell you?

790
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,577
Didn't I tell you he'll try to spoil my chances?

791
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,319
Ramya, just relax please.
- How? How can I relax?

792
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,253
I feel Krishna isn't like what you perceive.

793
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,891
He's calling me informally.

794
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:43,494
Aravind was insulting women, Krishna was supporting you.

795
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,334
Krishna would've induced Aravind to say that.

796
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,671
But everything ended happily, right?

797
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,008
You reacted properly, Aravind is happy.

798
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:55,178
You're also happy.
- No... no... that Krishna...

799
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,339
Ramya, just relax please.

800
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,351
Concentrate on your future.

801
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,951
It's all just till you're married.

802
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,352
You'll be in us after that.

803
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,690
Krishna will not be a pain in your neck.

804
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,189
Just 2 days only, you'll be engaged.

805
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:13,090
...you'll marry & everything will end happily.

806
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,359
I feel like cracking his head with bowling ball.

807
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:24,205
Concentrate on Aravind.

808
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,202
Think about Aravind.

809
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,043
Close your eyes.

810
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:32,215
What are you doing?

811
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,719
You and Aravind are on the top of a mountain.

812
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,454
Aravind is looking at you and smiling.

813
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:46,790
You're feeling shy. You're breaking into a song.

814
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,625
...and dancing.

815
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,391
...and tightly hugging him.

816
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:05,241
<I>A cuckoo is searching.</I>

817
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:08,714
<I>Another cuckoo is inviting.</I>

818
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:15,755
<I>Air is their nest</I> <I>- will it happen?</I>

819
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,918
<I>When Adam and eve met,</I>

820
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:23,598
<I>apple tree started</I> <I>bearing fruits.</I>

821
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:27,598
<I>Cloud started showering rain.</I>

822
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,602
<I>Is it greeting card?</I>

823
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,935
<I>Snake has poison only in the teeth.</I>

824
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,777
<I>Why do you need this woman</I> <I>who is personified poison?</I>

825
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,448
<I>You're a schemer.</I>

826
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,948
<I>A mischief monger</I> <I>creating trouble.</I>

827
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:49,455
<I>A cuckoo is searching.</I>

828
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,118
<I>Another cuckoo is inviting.</I>

829
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:57,130
<I>Air is their nest.</I>

830
00:48:57,334 --> 00:49:00,064
<I>Will it happen?</I>

831
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,628
<I>Marriage is fixed in march.</I> <I>- It'll never happen.</I>

832
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:37,331
<I>With our parents blessings.</I> <I>- I'll not allow it to happen.</I>

833
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,668
<I>I had a dream.</I>

834
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,002
<I>What is it?</I>

835
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:43,509
<I>Honeymoon in Kashmir.</I>

836
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,510
<I>It's just a wish.</I>

837
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:48,173
<I>In a web of relationship...</I> <I>- get stuck...</I>

838
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:52,014
<I>... you'll be like a bee</I> <I>caught in a cobweb.</I>

839
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:55,350
<I>She'll give you an itch</I> <I>like a bedbug.</I>

840
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:59,689
<I>Oh! I am vexed with this guy.</I>

841
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:03,263
<I>A cuckoo is searching.</I>

842
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:07,025
<I>Another cuckoo is inviting.</I>

843
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:11,035
<I>Air is their nest.</I>

844
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,869
<I>Will it happen?</I>

845
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,416
<I>You're a goddess.</I>

846
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:54,914
<I>Goddess!? She's a devil!</I>

847
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:56,982
<I>you're a bloomed lotus.</I>

848
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,586
<I>Lotus? Poisonous flower!</I>

849
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,757
<I>to become your life partner.</I>

850
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,356
<I>Playing a drama.</I>

851
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,754
<I>... I was waiting for you.</I>

852
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:05,928
<I>... white lie...</I>

853
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:09,428
<I>bloody jackal!</I> <I>you're out to spoil my life.</I>

854
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:13,194
<I>Stop your devil's acts.</I>

855
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:18,705
<I>Are you qualified to say it?</I>

856
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,934
<I>You're a blood sucking vampire.</I>

857
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:24,602
<I>A cuckoo is searching.</I>

858
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:28,273
<I>Another cuckoo is inviting.</I>

859
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:32,282
<I>Air is their nest.</I>

860
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:36,118
<I>Will it happen?</I>

861
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:48,135
<I>Send one copy to everyone</I> <I>in the testing department.</I>

862
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:51,136
<I>Make a soft copy of this and</I> <I>send it to my cabin.
- Yes sir.</I>

863
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:52,306
<I>Fast. Okay.</I>

864
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,642
What's this?
- Purchase bills for the new machinery.

865
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:59,641
Hi! Aravind is not here.
- I know.

866
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,383
I've come to meet you only.

867
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:04,984
I've come to tell you, try your cheap tricks on someone else.

868
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,013
Let's go to my cabin.

869
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:10,919
Let your staff also know the villain in you.

870
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:13,828
What did I do?
- Don't act.

871
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,321
You tried to irritate me.

872
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,257
You tried to make a fool of me before Aravind.

873
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,833
Hello! I tried to make you be yourself.

874
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,497
Aravind too expects the same.

875
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:24,499
Trust me, he told me.

876
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,176
Krishna, we've old scores to settle.

877
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,509
But, don't play with my life.

878
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,177
This marriage must happen.

879
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,516
Not for me but for the sake of Lata.

880
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:34,513
For the sake of my family.

881
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,013
Please for god's sake, don't spoil it, okay?

882
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:40,417
Ramya, please listen to me, it's for your good only.

883
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,451
What are you watching fun? Mind your work.

884
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:50,297
Why're you still with the laptop?

885
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,865
Today it's your engagement, son.

886
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:55,504
Get dressed up son. Why is he making a gesture like this?

887
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,003
Get up, we are getting late. Hey stop.

888
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,368
What's this?
- I'll keep it in car.

889
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:01,703
What'll you keep in car?

890
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,641
Engagement party must be great when it leaves my hone.

891
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,806
Arrange everything neatly and make a dashing entry.

892
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,610
Let's arrange it there.
- No, arrange it here only.

893
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,548
She's now like this.

894
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:16,654
After marriage, your mother & wife will play a game with your life.

895
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,885
Be careful, I'm coming mother.

896
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,890
Aravind, your dress is ready.

897
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,729
Why're you sitting here? Your mother is...

898
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:25,666
what happened?

899
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:27,663
Marriage tension?

900
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,733
This is not marriage... engagement.

901
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:35,235
What're you saying?
- Let's go.

902
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,247
Greetings!
- Greetings. Are you doing well?

903
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,417
Uncle, quick, they're here.

904
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,747
Move... move.

905
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,085
<I>With the blessings of Lord Murugan,</I>

906
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:54,923
<I>in the Tamil year of Parthiba,</I> <I>on the 3rd day of Tamil month aani,</I>

907
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:56,959
sister, groom's people have arrived.

908
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:00,762
Tell him to give a smile.

909
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:03,267
Welcome, son-in-law.

910
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,267
Buddy! Give a beaming smile.

911
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:13,115
Pour it near threshold... welcome.

912
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:20,779
<I>With Velachery Venkatraman and</I> <I>Ramani's son Aravind...</I>

913
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:26,952
<I>marriage is fixed on</I> <I>July 4th of 2005,</I>

914
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:32,465
on the auspicious day of star Rohini between morning 6 am & 7.30 am.

915
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:33,294
Priest, one minute.

916
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,295
No...

917
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:40,434
what?
- What?

918
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,474
I told him to postpone the marriage for 6 months.

919
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:43,646
Why?
- Why?

920
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,547
Why is he doing it?
- What's this?

921
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:46,880
What's the problem?

922
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,151
I'm postponing the marriage for 6 months.

923
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,747
He's postponing.

924
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:54,588
6 months?
- Yes, I'll get free time then.

925
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,486
I can come 2 months early and spend time here.

926
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,157
6 months is too...

927
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,328
why're you worried?

928
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,993
This has to be decided by me and Ramya.

929
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,997
What do you say Ramya? Okay?

930
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,998
Say no.

931
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,674
If it's okay to you, it's okay for me too.

932
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,108
She's fine.

933
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:18,571
On the 26th day, Sunday of Tamil month Karthik,

934
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,182
between 6 am to 7.30 am,

935
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:24,418
the marriage is fixed by the elders of both families,

936
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:25,777
exchange proposals.

937
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:29,951
Congrats groom.

938
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,038
Happy.

939
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:53,808
Congrats.

940
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,286
Why didn't you inform us earlier?

941
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:02,653
You are postponing marriage for 6 months in the last moment?

942
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,826
Is it justified?

943
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:05,223
I wanted time to think.

944
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:06,554
What do you want to think?

945
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,557
I want to think about this marriage again.

946
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,062
What?
- Yes.

947
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,632
I think that girl will not suit me.

948
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:13,734
So, I must reconsider my decision.

949
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,064
What're you blabbering? You are saying as you feel it.

950
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,240
I can marry only when I wish.

951
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:19,066
I can't marry for your wish.

952
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,402
Okay, you are marrying for your wish only.

953
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,238
You're postponing marriage for 6 months.

954
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,582
What if you say no then? Is it any game?

955
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,307
This is not a game, it's life.

956
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:31,082
Do I've to marry her even if I don't like her?

957
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,151
Is that what you want?

958
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:35,924
Okay... I'll finish it.

959
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:37,923
I'll finish it right now.

960
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,922
I'll call and cancel the marriage. Okay?

961
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,429
Aravind, wait.

962
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,426
She's not my girl. I'm going to say no.

963
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,863
What're you going to say?
- Cancel this marriage.

964
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,598
Aravind, don't be in a haste. Ramya is a girl of your choice.

965
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,103
Okay, whatever it may.

966
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,937
What're you going to tell them?

967
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,273
I'm going to cancel the marriage.

968
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,615
No, don't rush.
- Move.

969
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,618
Don't call them.
- Krishna please.

970
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,624
Ramya... it's Aravind.

971
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:11,961
Hi Aravind.

972
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,562
I've an urgent meeting in u.s. I'm leaving now.

973
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,958
Oh... okay.

974
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,361
I'll come to the airport.
- That's best.

975
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:25,296
Which flight?
- Lufthansa 3.30.

976
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:28,807
Okay, let's meet there... bye.

977
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:29,811
Bye.

978
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:41,487
Try to understand.
- Don't convince me.

979
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,488
Krishna, follow him on bike.

980
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,628
You're deciding in haste.

981
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:51,297
Who are you?

982
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:52,126
This is my life.

983
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:53,969
I can't live to fulfill your aspirations.

984
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:55,962
You said you like her, didn't you?

985
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,400
You asked me to reject her.

986
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,375
Indeed, but I've changed my mind.

987
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,134
Yeah! I too changed my mind.

988
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,911
Hey, she's a good girl.
- Correct.

989
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:04,807
She's a good girl.

990
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,641
Let her marry a 9 to 5 man,

991
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,750
and pack his frugal lunch box

992
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,817
and read a Tamil magazine leisurely at home.

993
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:11,811
You are talking harsh.

994
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:13,818
You & mother have hatched a plan to cheat me.

995
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,492
You know my choice of girl but mother liked this girl.
