00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:59,925
Today is such a beautiful day.
It is such a marvellous day..

4
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:04,967
Today after 10 years our son
is returning from foreign soil.

5
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:10,342
Queen, today everything
has become so beautiful.

6
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:16,717
But, you haven't seen him yet!
He had gone abroad before..

7
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,425
We married. When he Went,
he was a kid of 10 years..

8
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:27,550
Today he is returning
as a youth of 21 years.

9
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,008
What is happening to you?

10
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:38,217
O king, I am thinking, you
are calling him my son..

11
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,300
But What if he does
not call me mother?

12
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:43,383
How can this happen?

13
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:47,133
A step-mother is much disrespected.

14
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:51,800
Queen Kalavati, he is my son.

15
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:56,508
A Suryavanshi prince.

16
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,050
He is Well-versed with the
limitations of our dynasty.

17
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:06,175
When I have made you my queen,
then he shall..

18
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:09,675
Accept you as his mother.
Undoubtedly he Will.

19
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:11,550
Absolutely not! You may go.

20
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,300
Long live the King.

00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:47,550
- You cannot go, little prince.
- Why can't I go?

33
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:50,508

that as soon as the..

00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,234
Prince comes, he will
be made heir apparent?

40
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:07,050
That was the king speaking.
I have not said that.

41
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:10,717
On this throne only
your son shall sit.

42
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,675
But what will you do of

00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:14,258
He is going to reach here shortly.

44

Why are you so sad?

154
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:32,717
Father..

Mum, your son greets you.

00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,008
O King, I am truly embarrassed.

159
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:54,175
When the prince was arriving,
someone shot a t him.

160
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:58,842
- Shot!
- Shot! Did my son get hurt? My son is saved.

Narpa t Singh! what kind

Queen, I too am troubled by this
incident. But I promise..

00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,842
Whoever dared to do this,
I'll certainly punish him.

164
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:12,508
Uncle, merci beaucoup. 'Thanks'
is said so in French.

165
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,800
You call yourself the best
shooter of this land..

And you could have
kill that pigeon!

00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:33,438
But it was his good luck
that he was saved.

00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:38,258
Lucku, lucku, lucku! This wordn

00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:44,508
Nanny, you do not worry. Now the y
won't hurry in killing me.

171
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:49,300
By my beard, my m o u stache they
a re really thinking of me..

172
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:52,592
As a clown and as a simpleton.

173
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:54,800
But son, you don't know
what all they can no.

174
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:58,383
Hence I sent Kapil abroad
so that he could make you..

175
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:00,383
Conisant of the dangers
lurking here.

176
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:03,842
It is his cleverness that has
saved me, nanny. Look a t this.

177
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:07,258
The y had definitely aimed correctly.

178
00:18:07,342 --> 00:18:10,800
Oh God! if this armour wasn't
there, what would have happened?

179
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:14,217
The idea was mine, mother.
And you were telling..

180
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,217
There was no need of armour.
Did you see my wit?

181
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,800
Agreed, sir.

182
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:22,800
But so n, you heedn to me. Return
ahbroadn today itself.

183
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:24,883
It was difficult reaching here..

184
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:27,467
But leaving from here
will be more so.

185
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:31,467
I will tell you a way. I n this
palace there's a secret tunnel..

186
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,425
Of which no one knows
except the queen and me.

187
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:36,092
You flee from there.

188
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:46,092
Ah, lovely, lovely!
What a route this is!

189
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:50,758
Thank you, nanny. This is a useful
thing you have told me.

190
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,383
I'll definitely use this tunnel.
Not to flee from here..

191
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,383
- But to accomplish my mission.
- What you..

192
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:59,925
Nanny, I have come here
to face my enemies..

193
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,467
Not to turn my back on them.

194
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:16,050
This won't happen.

195
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:21,925
The prince
has shattered my dreams.

196
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:31,258
I had never though t that my
son will return as a clown.

197
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,050
I have sinned,

198
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,842
for which I
am getting this punishment.

199
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:44,050
- Son!
- Nanny, I wan t to tell father that if he had dreamed..

200
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:48,092
Then I too had wished
that I would one day..

201
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:50,883
Sit b y his feet and serve him.

202
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,800
But hyehyas raisedn a wall
of thy o r ns around nhyi m.

203
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:56,467
You have to break those very thorns.

204
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:02,467
But I want time for that. I can not
see is grief. I can not.

205
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:11,092
I will tell him e everything. I will
tell him e everything right now.

206
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:12,467
Son..

207
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:21,008
Father, since I have come, I'd
like to tell you something.

208
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:23,175
Speak.

209
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:26,842
- H o w a re you son?
- Long live the Prince!

210
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:29,883
Why are you silent? Speak.

211
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:38,383
Father, I am much disturbed.
A friend that has returned..

212
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:41,425
With me is too sick.

213
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:43,467
Who, that professor?

214
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,842
No, uncle, no. He is a
good friend of mine.

215
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:50,800
He has even shared a bed with
me. You may say that..

216
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:52,633
I have a blood tie with me.

217
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,925
Where is he?

218
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,842
He is with me, father.
May I show him to you?

219
00:20:58,342 --> 00:20:59,592
Show.

220
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,383
Father, this is a bedbug
from that country.

221
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:11,342
He has my blood within him.

222
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:15,217
Uncle, he has not had any
blood since yesterday.

223
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,175
Call some doctor.

224
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:20,717
Stop this nonsense! Get
away from my sigh t.

225
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,467
This is what everyone wan t s.

226
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:30,133
O King, you must not scold
that poor fellow!

227
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:32,592
Yes King, one should
not scold a lunatic.

228
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:36,050
He is not a lunatic. You
do not worry, king.

229
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:38,883
The qualities of a prince
can be ins tilled in him.

230
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:44,592
Do not give me these false
consolations. Do anything..

231
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:51,133
Anything, but I want
a prince. My prince!

232
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:03,925
Kumar, you? what are
you doing there?

233
00:22:04,092 --> 00:22:06,800
- I am seeing you, brother.
- Why?

234
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,717
I find you like able.

235
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:10,193
Then why are you standing so far?

236
00:22:10,217 --> 00:22:12,842
If I come closer you will beat me.

237
00:22:13,092 --> 00:22:14,217
Why will I beat you?

238
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,050
Because you a re a lunatic.

239
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:23,300
I will not tell you anything.
Come, come close to me.

240
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,133
Really? You will not tell anything?

241
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:29,425
No, I won't. Come. Come, come..

242
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,758
Do you think I am a lunatic?

243
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,717
No brother, I actually
like you very much.

244
00:22:38,842 --> 00:22:41,008
Why does everyone take
you to be a lunatic?

245
00:22:41,842 --> 00:22:46,217
Because their hearts are fillen
withy selfish ness, greed nand..

246
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:52,717
Enmity. And in your heart, a
brilliance of innocent love.

247
00:22:54,342 --> 00:22:56,758
That is why you can see the truth.

248
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,633
Brother, you had told me..

249
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,300
To y s? To y s, wasn't that what I said?

250
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:06,133
I have them. Come; come
with me, my friend.

251
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,633
Come, I will give you the to y s.

252
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,342
Have the offering, father.

253
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,717
Father..

254
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,842
You disturbed my meditation.
What is the matter?

255
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:19,050
Take the offering for Lord Hanuman.

256
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:21,776
You always give me the offering
of Lord Hanuman..

257
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,717
But I do not know when
Hanuman will send..

258
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,383
Something for you.

259
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:26,842
Father..

260
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,383
Ah, ah, ah..

261
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:31,717
Father, sorry. I was telling
that last night..

262
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,467
Lord Hanuman graced me with
is presence in area..

263
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,800
And he told me that
he will send for me a..

264
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:40,967
A what? A monkey?

265
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,258
- No, no, father, not a monkey. Not a monkey.
- Then?

266
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,592
He'll send for me a husband.

267
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,758
Oh Almighty! There are so
many fools in the world.

268
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:58,550
Send a t leas t one fool here.
No one else will accept her.

269
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,967
Jagatram.. Jagatram..

270
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,842
Jagtram? Hey Jagatram..
Oye Jagatram..

271
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:09,050
Oh, oh, so I am..

272
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:11,008
Jagatram. And I am..

273
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:11,717
Bhyagatram!

274
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,633
- And everyone in the world is..
- Thagatram!

275
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:15,300
Ram! Ram!

276
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:20,383
Today's hot news! Number
one my mother has told..

277
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:24,508
Of such a beautiful place
of which I am well aware of.

278
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:28,175
Would you know it? I used
to play there as a child.

279
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:28,842
Really?

280
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:32,217
N umber two Thes tuff is all
ready for us to go there.

281
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:32,967
Very good.

282
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,092
Number three That secret
mansion of Narpat is also..

283
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,133
In a secret cave in this place.

284
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,425
- Is that so?
- Yes.

285
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,467
And this is a pair of binoculars.
Keep close watch withy this.

286
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,258
I'll jus t come after
ea ting some curry.

287
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:51,467
- I'll beat you with a s tick.
- Good, good. Look there.

288
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,425
- Bhee masaran is coming. He's o ne of Na rpat's mai n me n.
- Really.

289
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:57,300
He mus t be going to meet him.

290
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:00,925
Let's g o a ndn see.

291
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,842
Lo rdn H a nu ma n, if yo u fu lfil
two of my wishyes..

292
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:08,758
I shall build a temple
for you here.

293
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,175
The firs t reques t is tha t you
mak e the leader of the tribe..

294
00:25:12,258 --> 00:25:15,967
And the second is to send
a son-in-law in my house.

295
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,842
You have to send a
foolish son-in-law.

296
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,758
Now permit me to leave. General
Narpa t is waiting.

297
00:25:31,383 --> 00:25:32,425
Long live H a nu ma n!

298
00:25:32,842 --> 00:25:35,217
Sir.

299
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:43,133
Wh y are you yelling
lik e a torn drum?

300
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:47,217
The tiger is speaking.

301
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,800
Can't you see? I am the wres tler
Dhartitod Pa tal Singh.

302
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:57,217
I am your fa ther, you ra t.
If I slap you..

303
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,175
I can drive you in to
the ground lik e a nail.

304
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:04,383
If I get angry,
then.. then.. then..

305
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:07,717
Hey, you bumbler!

306
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,717
Sir.

307
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,592
Come Bheemasaran, I was
waiting for you only.

308
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:14,883
The pa ths are all crook ed.
Hence I got la te.

309
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,092
The pa ths on which
we are walking, there..

310
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:19,855
E ven a momen t's delay
would be lethal.

311
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:23,508
U nders tood. Henceforth,
I shall not mak e e ven a..

312
00:26:23,592 --> 00:26:27,592
Split second delay. what? t
is this in your hand?

313
00:26:28,508 --> 00:26:29,842
The palace.

314
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:32,758
The palace! How can you hold
such a huge palace in..

315
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,967
Your hands? wh y are
you joking with me?

316
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:40,717
- See here.
- There are some white and black lines.

317
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,925
Don't tak e them to be mere
lines, Bheemasaran.

318
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:46,383
- These lines could become the lines of our des tiny.
- I s tha t so?

319
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:47,984
The only thing lacking is
to fill colour in them.

320
00:26:48,008 --> 00:26:49,467
Then give me, I'll fill.

321
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:54,008
This is not in your capacity. It
will have to be filled with blood.

322
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:57,842
- Blo odn!
- A ndn I nsteadn of a hb ru shy, a swo rdn!

323
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:00,383
I told you I don't
wan t to go inside.

324
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:02,550
But the lo rdn is waiti ng fo r u s.

325
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:06,758
Tha t son of a monk e y! You
go and have tea with him.

326
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,217
I do not wan t to sell horses for
his army a t such a low ra te.

327
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,425
I have said yes to Bheemasaran.

328
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:16,258
I have not said yes. I
don't know Bheemasaran.

329
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:19,967
Cons table, cons table, you tell.
Am I mad tha t I will..

330
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:24,133
Sell my horses to this donk e y
a t such a low ra te?

331
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:28,842
I know. But it is difficult to meet
such a big man of the palace.

332
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:30,467
You think tha t you made no profit.

333
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,383
What? t balderdash this fool is
saying! Half the amoun t..

334
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:37,217
We get inside, we'll have
to give to these gen tlemen.

335
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,842
Wh y brother, isn't
this the rule here?

336
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:42,550
Yes, yes, absolutely.

337

339
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:51,217
He is a very nice man. Go
inside and reques t him.

340

P rohbahbly yo u'll g

342
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,467
If I go and reques t, he'll lose
his temper. He'll call you..

343
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,925
And tell you to arres t both of us.

344
00:28:04,008 --> 00:28:07,842
No, no, you go inside. Even
if he calls, we won't come.

345
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:09,800
Go on, go on.

346
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:14,383
B rothe rs, kueep yo u r hba g s readny.
It's a hbig dneal.

347
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:16,675
Yes, go inside.

348
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:19,550
See, all the prepara tions are done.

349
00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:21,592
But whyat will we have to dn o? h

Firs t and foremos t, crea te ha tred

351
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:27,425
Agains t the prince. So tha t
when we kill the prince..

352
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:28,948
- The people may not re volt.
- Yes.

353
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:31,550
And you know tha t ha tred is
such a thing tha t when..

354
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:34,633
In flamed it can set ablaze not
jus t the palace, but the world.

355
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:44,383
If such a momen t arises, then
we'll have to tread with care.

356
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:47,008
This is the cle veres t thing.

357
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:09,633
Wh y are you hitting?

358
00:29:09,717 --> 00:29:12,883
Don't hit me.. don't hit me..

359
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:29,092
Guards, ca t ch them.
Don't let them go.

360
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:31,800
I think the y are raising the price.

361
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:42,217
Ca t ch them.. Follow them..

362
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,467

Lo o ku the re. B othy of

It's a good thing tha t the y

365
00:32:09,508 --> 00:32:12,967
"Come, the spring has come.."

366
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,133
"This heart is awaiting.."

367
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:18,800
"O my prince.."

368
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:21,175
"I cannot live without you."

369
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:24,675
"Come, the spring has come.."

370
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:27,508
"This heart is awaiting.."

371
00:32:27,592 --> 00:32:30,258
"O my prince.."

372
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:33,342
"I cannot live without you."

373
00:32:33,425 --> 00:32:35,717
"Come.."

374
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:10,342
"Whenever the breeze
blows haltingly.."

375
00:33:10,425 --> 00:33:16,258
"Whenever the breeze
blows haltingly.."

376
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:19,217
"My body breaks.."

377
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,925
"My body breaks.."

378
00:33:22,008 --> 00:33:24,967
"I contort myself.."

379
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,925
"I contort myself."

380
00:33:27,342 --> 00:33:30,383
"This heart repeatedly.."

381
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,342
"Waits for you.."

382
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:36,175
"O my prince.."

383
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:39,175
"I cannot live without you."

384
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:42,008
"Come, the spring has come.."

385
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:44,967
"This heart is awaiting.."

386
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,883
"O my prince.."

387
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:50,800
"I cannot live without you."

388
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:52,925
"Come.."

389
00:34:19,382 --> 00:34:25,257
"I hear your flute in my heart.."

390
00:34:25,342 --> 00:34:30,925
"I hear your flute in my heart.."

391
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:33,841
"I dance on the rhythm.."

392
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:36,674
"I dance on the rhythm.."

393
00:34:36,757 --> 00:34:39,591
"Of my anklets.."

394
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:41,925
"Of my anklets.."

395
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:45,049
"Each shred of this heart.."

396
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:48,216
"Is indebted to you.."

397
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,925
"O my prince.."

398
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:53,799
"I cannot live without you."

399
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,842
"Come, the spring has come.."

400
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:59,467
"This heart is awaiting.."

401
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,508
"O my prince.."

402
00:35:02,592 --> 00:35:05,217
"I cannot live without you."

403
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,592
"Come.."

404
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:42,133
"A fish of the waters is thirsty
in those very waters.."

405
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:47,425
"A fish of the waters is thirsty
in those very waters.."

406
00:35:47,508 --> 00:35:50,550
"These are happy days.."

407
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:53,175
"These are happy days.."

408
00:35:53,258 --> 00:35:56,175
"Yet there is some grief.."

409
00:35:56,258 --> 00:35:58,258
"Yet there is some grief."

410
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:01,383
"Filled with my love.."

411
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:04,217
"Come this once.."

412
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,217
"O my prince.."

413
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,092
"I cannot live without you."

414
00:36:10,175 --> 00:36:13,175
"Come, the spring has come.."

415
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:16,008
"This heart is awaiting.."

416
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:18,550
"O my prince.."

417
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:21,508
"I cannot live without you."

418
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:23,967
"Come.."

419
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:03,258
See, someone has fallen in the
water. Pull them out, quick..

420
00:37:03,342 --> 00:37:05,175
Come on.. come on..

421
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:08,550
How are they?

422
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:10,550
Their pulse is running, princess.

423
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:15,800
The heart is also beating.
Rub their feet.

424
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:18,133
Rubbing their feet will be useless.
Lay them inverted.

425
00:37:19,383 --> 00:37:20,967
There is water filled
in their bellies.

426
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:35,262
They are saved! They are saved.
Turn them around.

427
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:46,675
Jagatram..

428
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:48,258
Yes Bhagatram?

429
00:37:48,342 --> 00:37:50,800
It is correctly written
in the scriptures that..

430
00:37:50,842 --> 00:37:54,800
When a man dies and
reaches paradise then..

431
00:37:54,883 --> 00:37:57,550
Beautiful nymphets serve him.

432
00:37:57,883 --> 00:38:04,717
What? Then all these belles are
sent by Raja Indra for us?

433
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:09,050
Hey beauty, please press my feet.

434
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:13,967
But maiden, you seem to
be the queen of beauties.

435
00:38:14,342 --> 00:38:17,467
Accepting service from you would
be an insult to beauty.

436
00:38:17,758 --> 00:38:21,633
If you desire, may I serve you?
May I press your hands?

437
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,467
May I press your legs?

438
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,425
Come to your senses. You are not
in paradise, but on earth.

439
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,383
Why are you lying? Such beauty
cannot exist on earth.

440
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:38,258
Good, good, good. God has made
this face in good time.

441
00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:41,467
Come to your senses. She is the
princess Sangita of Ankor.

442
00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:43,342
Princess Sangita!

443
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:49,092
Where do you stay?

444
00:38:49,758 --> 00:38:51,842
- I am a villager.
- And I live on the mountains.

445
00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:53,425
Our village is quite far from here.

446
00:38:53,675 --> 00:38:54,717
Where are you going?

447
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,609
We are going to the city. We
have heard of the arrival..

448
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,592
Of the prince. So we
are going to see him.

449
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,050
Going to see the prince?

450
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:05,342
Do you want to send a love
message to the prince?

451
00:39:06,008 --> 00:39:10,383
Love message? Me, send
to that monkey?

452
00:39:10,717 --> 00:39:14,717
Do you call lovers monkeys?

453
00:39:15,008 --> 00:39:15,800
What do you mean?

454
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:17,300
Weren't you singing just now..

455
00:39:17,383 --> 00:39:20,175
Come, the spring has come.."

456
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:22,675
This heart is awaiting..

457
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:25,175
O my prince..

458
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:27,383
I cannot live without you.

459
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:28,901
And now you are calling
him a monkey?

460
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:31,467
I was calling the
prince of my heart.

461
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:38,592
Is that so? I too am a prince
of my heart. Did you call me?

462
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,425
Why? Did I commit some mistake?

463
00:39:49,717 --> 00:39:51,842
You are too nave, Bhagatramji.

464
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:59,842
Bhagatramji? Did you call
me Bhagatramji? Ram! Ram!

465
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:03,050
Listen.. You did not
call me Jagatramji..

466
00:40:04,092 --> 00:40:07,092
Princess, the leader
must be waiting.

467
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,675
Ram! Ram!

468
00:40:12,258 --> 00:40:13,467
Ram! Ram!

469
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,008
Bhagatramji..

470
00:40:20,258 --> 00:40:22,383
Jagatramji..

471
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:24,300
Ram! Ram!

472
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:26,592
I suggest you to put some
responsibilities on the..

473
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:28,675
Shoulders of the prince.
He himself will learn..

474
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,550
To manage the affairs
of the kingdom.

475
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:35,425
I pray to you to make
him the heir apparent.

476
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:39,383
No, Diwan, I do not have trust
that he can properly fulfil..

477
00:40:40,383 --> 00:40:43,883
All responsibilities of the realm.

478
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:46,592
O king, do not put so many
responsibilities on him..

479
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:48,800
My poor son will be scared.

480
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:52,675
Queen, the king is right. He
should be made heir apparent.

481
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:55,373
I am there, the Diwan is there.
If there is any problem..

482
00:40:55,425 --> 00:40:56,758
It will be looked after.

483
00:40:58,342 --> 00:41:01,300
If you both are ready to shoulder
this responsibility..

484
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:03,467
Then I am agreeable.

485
00:41:03,883 --> 00:41:06,508
Yes, yes, my elder brother will
become the heir apparent.

486
00:41:58,175 --> 00:42:01,425
Long live Prince Bhanu Pratap!

487
00:42:01,508 --> 00:42:04,425
Long live Prince Bhanu Pratap!

488
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:07,842
Long live Prince Bhanu Pratap!

489
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:59,175
O King, as per custom we
have come to present..

490
00:43:59,258 --> 00:44:03,092
The prince a golden lotus
and a silver dagger.

491
00:44:03,175 --> 00:44:05,675
A golden lotus and silver
dagger! Very good.

492
00:44:05,758 --> 00:44:09,092
Daughter, come ahead and present
the gift to the prince.

493
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:11,425
Come, daughter, come.

494
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:17,383
No, no, no, this will
be an insult to beauty.

495
00:44:19,383 --> 00:44:22,300
Not you, but I'll come to you.

496
00:44:22,883 --> 00:44:27,008
Diwanji.. The flower doesn't
go to the bee but..

497
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:32,842
The bee goes to the flower.
The dew drops on the flower..

498
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:35,092
I accept this gift.

499
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:36,258
Bhanu Pratap!

500
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,342
Daddy, I'm only praising beauty.

501
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:41,050
Stop this nonsense!

502
00:44:48,758 --> 00:44:53,633
Queen, Jack, Joker. The King
wants to put a joker..

503
00:44:54,342 --> 00:44:57,675
On the throne. They do
not know that the Jack..

504
00:44:57,758 --> 00:45:03,008
Will dispose of the Joker
and assume the throne soon.

505
00:45:03,092 --> 00:45:06,300
If the Jack owns the throne,
then the slave of the Jack..

506
00:45:06,383 --> 00:45:08,300
Will become the leader of the tribe.

507
00:45:08,383 --> 00:45:12,217
Lord, I find this destination
to be very far.

508
00:45:12,592 --> 00:45:15,550
It is not so far now. The ire
that has spread in your tribe..

509
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:18,342
Due to the misdeeds of the
prince; we must take..

510
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:19,717
Advantage of that.

511
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,842
- How.
- I am going to send such an arrow that by the same..

512
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:27,300
Both the prince and your
leader will be finished.

513
00:45:27,675 --> 00:45:30,883
Then it will be easy to
remove the old king.

514
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:33,592
Then use that arrow just now.

515
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,008
Not now. This drama will
be enacted at night.

516
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:44,092
Let's see what role the queen
has to play. Queen Kalavati.

517
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,467
So much time to change the picture?

518
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,190
The prince must be on
his way. Make haste.

519
00:46:01,883 --> 00:46:04,883
Lady, today is such
an auspicious day.

520
00:46:05,383 --> 00:46:07,175
Your son has been made a prince.

521
00:46:08,008 --> 00:46:09,550
Please bless him.

522
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:15,550
Come, prince. First of all, seek
blessings of your mother.

523
00:46:23,675 --> 00:46:27,092
If only the queen was
alive to see this day!

524
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:33,675
- Mother?
- Mother! You called me mother! Me?

525
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:35,925
Why not? Am I not Kumar's brother?

526
00:46:36,008 --> 00:46:40,508
Live long, son, live long.
Give me strength that..

527
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:44,008
I may fulfil all your duties.
Son, I have organised..

528
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:47,175
A worship ceremony in the
temple of Goddess Kali.

529
00:46:47,258 --> 00:46:50,675
Come quick, it's getting time.
You come with all the things.

530
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:52,092
Come on, son, come on.

531
00:46:59,842 --> 00:47:03,383
Lord, the queen has reached the
Kali temple with the prince.

532
00:47:03,592 --> 00:47:05,592
Okay. You can go.

533
00:47:19,633 --> 00:47:22,550
The prince! Here?

534
00:47:28,592 --> 00:47:29,592
What is it?

535
00:47:29,633 --> 00:47:32,967
The prince has desired
that the princess may..

536
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,800
Stay at his place
as his guest tonight.

537
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:38,925
Stay at his palace? What
nonsense is this?

538
00:47:39,258 --> 00:47:41,883
He has heard that she
dances very gracefully.

539
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:44,508
He wants to see her
dance in his palace.

540
00:47:44,592 --> 00:47:49,175
Silent! Before I pull your tongue,
get out of here.

541
00:47:49,258 --> 00:47:51,618
But the prince has ordered us,
that if you do not send her..

542
00:47:51,675 --> 00:47:54,008
Willingly, then we must use force.

543
00:47:54,092 --> 00:47:57,758
Force? The one who can take
the daughter of the..

544
00:47:57,842 --> 00:48:02,092
Leader of Ankor and threaten
him cannot live.

545
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,217
Hail goddess!

546
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:10,092
Look what the prince's man has
done! He's killed the leader.

547
00:48:10,175 --> 00:48:12,675
Leader.. leader..

548
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,633
Father, what happened!

549
00:48:17,717 --> 00:48:25,300
The prince has.. Revenge..

550
00:48:25,592 --> 00:48:30,133
- Revenge.. revenge..
- Father..

551
00:48:34,508 --> 00:48:38,175
What are you looking at?
We must take revenge.

552
00:48:38,258 --> 00:48:41,133
The slayer of the leader
of Ankor cannot leave.

553
00:48:41,383 --> 00:48:44,467
Lift the leader's corpse.
We must bathe it with..

554
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,217
The blood of the prince.

555
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:52,550
Mother goddess! Fulfil my wish.

556
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:57,342
Come son, seek blessings
of the mother goddess.

557
00:49:04,217 --> 00:49:05,383
Leave him, son.

558
00:49:06,383 --> 00:49:07,842
You know him?

559
00:49:07,883 --> 00:49:10,883
How will I not know the
disease of a lifetime?

560
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:12,383
What are you saying, mother?

561
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,633
Don't read this, son..
Don't read this.

562
00:49:16,925 --> 00:49:21,717
Queen Kalavati, the Rs. 100,000
are not received yet.

563
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:25,800
If not received soon, then the
tale of your birth will be told..

564
00:49:25,842 --> 00:49:29,092
To the king. Your secret-bearer.

565
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,633
What is this all, mother?
Who was that man?

566
00:49:32,883 --> 00:49:35,633
What is the matter, mother?
What is the matter?

567
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:39,342
Son, in life, someone does
wrong and someone else..

568
00:49:39,425 --> 00:49:42,758
Has to pay for it.
I am one of them.

569
00:49:43,508 --> 00:49:45,467
My mother was a danseuse.

570
00:49:48,675 --> 00:49:52,675
Mother! Does father know all this?

571
00:49:52,758 --> 00:49:54,842
I have kept this a secret from him.

572
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,800
Why? Why mother?

573
00:49:58,175 --> 00:50:01,342
If he knows, then he'll feel
it's a blot on Suryavansh.

574
00:50:01,425 --> 00:50:03,592
He will not bear all this.

575
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:06,008
No, mother, you must tell him this.

576
00:50:06,092 --> 00:50:08,092
I believe that father will
never misunderstand you.

577
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:11,133
If you want to see him alive,
then never tell him..

578
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:15,217
That this day you were with
me and you know my secret.

579
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:20,675
- Mother!
- No promise me, promise me, my son.

580
00:50:20,758 --> 00:50:25,258
- I fall at your feet.
- No, mother, I promise.

581
00:50:26,092 --> 00:50:32,133
May you live long! May
you live long, son!

582
00:50:34,133 --> 00:50:39,425
I swear in my mother's name,
I'll not tell this to anyone.

583
00:50:40,425 --> 00:50:42,842
Bring the murderer out.

584
00:50:42,925 --> 00:50:44,175
What do you want?

585
00:50:44,258 --> 00:50:46,050
That you bring the murderer.

586
00:50:46,133 --> 00:50:47,258
Hand over the prince.

587
00:50:47,342 --> 00:50:49,383
We seek revenge for the
blood of our leader.

588
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,758
Don't you know this is a palace?

589
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:57,133
Is it a crime to ask for
justice in a palace?

590
00:50:57,217 --> 00:50:59,800
If a murderer is hidden within
the palace, then where..

591
00:50:59,842 --> 00:51:01,425
Will we get justice?

592
00:51:01,633 --> 00:51:03,776
Justice will be done here and
it will be certainly done.

593
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,800
Everybody knows that if it
is necessary for justice..

594
00:51:06,842 --> 00:51:08,193
Then the king can
even hang his son.

595
00:51:08,217 --> 00:51:10,234
This is the true test for justice.
I have come to ask..

596
00:51:10,258 --> 00:51:12,425
Justice for the murder
of my father.

597
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:15,008
Justice will certainly be done.

598
00:51:22,383 --> 00:51:24,133
Who has killed you father?

599
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:26,550
Your son, the prince.

600
00:51:28,258 --> 00:51:29,800
The prince?

601
00:51:29,883 --> 00:51:30,883
Yes, the prince.

602
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:34,092
What proof do you have that
the prince has killed?

603
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:41,050
Proof? My father's corpse is
my proof. The father who..

604
00:51:42,592 --> 00:51:47,717
Valued his daughter's modesty
more than his life.

605
00:51:48,258 --> 00:51:53,633
Child, this is an accusation,
not a proof.

606
00:51:53,717 --> 00:51:56,550
We are the proof. We have
seen the prince..

607
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:58,758
Running away after committing
the murder.

608
00:51:58,842 --> 00:52:01,675
Bear in mind. If this
thing is proven wrong..

609
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,690
Then the very same
punishment you ask..

610
00:52:03,717 --> 00:52:05,633
For the prince can also
be given for you.

611
00:52:05,717 --> 00:52:08,800
Think again. This allegation
is on the prince.

612
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:12,550
Yes, on that impudent
and wayward prince..

613
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:16,842
Who has humiliated our
princess umpteen times..

614
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:20,258
Now I have only question. Will
the king do justice or..

615
00:52:20,342 --> 00:52:24,175
We'll have to seek our own
vengeance? Answer, O king.

616
00:52:24,258 --> 00:52:26,842
The king's answer has
always been justice.

617
00:52:27,092 --> 00:52:29,758
As long as the justice is not done,
we won't go from here.

618
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,342
We won't go..

619
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:32,842
We won't go..

620
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:34,633
We won't go..

621
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,550
Wherever the prince is, bring
him to me this very moment.

622
00:52:39,842 --> 00:52:40,842
As you wish.

623
00:52:47,217 --> 00:52:49,758
Prince, the king is calling you.

624
00:52:49,842 --> 00:52:50,800
Me, uncle?

625
00:52:50,842 --> 00:52:52,050
Yes. Come.

626
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,633
Prince.. the prince is come.

627
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:05,550
You are still angry with the prince?

628
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:09,550
Bhanu Pratap! Is it true that
you have killed their leader?

629
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:18,633
Killed their leader? Killed
the father of the princess?

630
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:25,008
What is this drama, prince?

631
00:53:25,092 --> 00:53:29,133
Bhanu Pratap! You haven't
answered the question.

632
00:53:36,175 --> 00:53:38,092
Why will I kill, father?

633
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:44,008
Bhanu Pratap! Now you are not
a son in front of your father..

634
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:46,967
But a criminal in front of a king.

635
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:51,383
Pardon me, king. Till the time
my crime isn't proved..

636
00:53:51,883 --> 00:53:54,092
I cannot be called a criminal.

637
00:53:54,175 --> 00:53:57,383
These people have presented
the proof of your crime.

638
00:53:57,883 --> 00:54:01,342
They say they have seen you
shooting at their leader.

639
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:06,842
What proof do you have that
you did not kill? I ask you..

640
00:54:07,342 --> 00:54:08,342
That moment..

641
00:54:12,842 --> 00:54:14,175
Tell..

642
00:54:15,258 --> 00:54:15,800
That moment..

643
00:54:15,883 --> 00:54:19,342
King, O King! What is this! The
one who was made a prince..

644
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:22,508
In the morning is a criminal now?

645
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,508
Queen, at this moment the love
of a mother is in you..

646
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,258
But do not forget right now
I am not a father, but a king.

647
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,050
It is the duty of a
king to mete justice.

648
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:37,217
Tell Bhanu Pratap! Where were you?

649
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,633
Yes, son, where were you?

650
00:54:42,508 --> 00:54:45,758
Mother.. You are asking me this?

651
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:47,758
What will this killer say?

652
00:54:50,175 --> 00:54:51,342
Bhanu Pratap!

653
00:54:53,175 --> 00:54:57,508
King, forgive him. He is your
blood. He is the son of that..

654
00:54:57,592 --> 00:55:01,508
Father whose each cell is
full of humanity and justice.

655
00:55:01,592 --> 00:55:04,342
Who can lose his head
to fulfil a promise..

656
00:55:04,425 --> 00:55:06,925
Who opens his mouth only for
the truth and not falsehood.

657
00:55:07,008 --> 00:55:10,258
Just think! How can your
son be a murderer?

658
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:17,175
In our dynasty no one has
been yet denied justice.

659
00:55:18,467 --> 00:55:20,883
Do not enmesh yourself in
the love for your son and..

660
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:24,467
Shame your dynasty. This will
absolutely not be done.

661
00:55:25,842 --> 00:55:30,508
Bhanu Pratap! Your silence
proves that you only have..

662
00:55:31,425 --> 00:55:33,675
Committed the murder.

663
00:55:33,758 --> 00:55:39,925
I did not. But I cannot
say any more.

664
00:55:40,175 --> 00:55:43,758
He is our criminal. He must
be handed over to us.

665
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,675
We will punish him according
to our laws.

666
00:55:46,758 --> 00:55:50,967
I cannot fulfil this request.
I only will do the justice.

667
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:55,800
O King, it is very difficult
to punish your only son.

668
00:55:55,842 --> 00:56:00,925
Princess, no one has yet
distrusted my justice.

669
00:56:01,842 --> 00:56:05,758
Narpat, may the criminal be kept
under vigil the whole night.

670
00:56:06,508 --> 00:56:09,508
Tomorrow, in front of all,
in a crowded assembly..

671
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,842
Justice shall be done.

672
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:13,092
As you wish, King.

673
00:56:20,842 --> 00:56:25,842
All is Truth. Truth is God.
Truth is beautiful.

674
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:47,050
Leave my brother. He
did not do anything.

675
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:49,133
Leave my brother, he
did not do anything.

676
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:49,800
Move aside, Kumar.

677
00:56:49,883 --> 00:56:54,842
No, I shall not. Brother,
I shall not let you go.

678
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:57,342
No, Kumar. I will have to go.
It's father's order.

679
00:56:57,425 --> 00:57:00,967
Then I'll go and tell father
to release my brother.

680
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,092
- I'll ask permission from him.
- Go and ask.

681
00:57:12,425 --> 00:57:15,008
Diwan, do not weaken my resolve.

682
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,883
While dispensing justice, I am
myself being weighed on scales.

683
00:57:19,842 --> 00:57:22,717
The goddess of justice
is looking at me.

684
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,133
Yes, father, the goddess of
justice is looking at you.

685
00:57:26,217 --> 00:57:28,577
She's telling you to be just to
your son, who hasn't killed.

686
00:57:28,633 --> 00:57:32,967
He's your son any my brother.
How can he kill?

687
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:37,800
You only think. Why will a prince
kill an ordinary man?

688
00:57:37,842 --> 00:57:39,758
Why are you silent? Answer me.

689
00:57:39,883 --> 00:57:41,425
- Queen..
- Yes..

690
00:57:41,508 --> 00:57:43,008
Take the prince away from here.

691
00:57:43,133 --> 00:57:44,258
Come on, son.

692
00:57:44,342 --> 00:57:46,508
He will only heed to
duty and justice.

693
00:57:46,883 --> 00:57:49,717
Our appeal will fall on
his deaf ears. Come on.

694
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,008
I will not come. Father, you
cannot give justice thus.

695
00:57:54,092 --> 00:57:57,050
Leave me, mother, leave me.

696
00:58:02,425 --> 00:58:07,092
Mother goddess, I have a prayer.

697
00:58:08,175 --> 00:58:13,592
May no father have to weigh his
son on the scales of justice!

698
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,425
What is this, prince?

699
00:58:24,008 --> 00:58:28,383
Nothing, nanny. The
enemy has succeeded.

700
00:58:28,467 --> 00:58:29,758
Now what will happen?

701
00:58:30,217 --> 00:58:35,300
What else? The king will have
to order me to be hanged.

702
00:58:35,383 --> 00:58:39,550
No, this cannot happen. I will
fall at his feet and tell him..

703
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:41,467
What the truth is.

704
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,925
Nanny! Who will believe in
the truth you have to say?

705
00:58:45,675 --> 00:58:47,842
If somehow I could escape
from this net..

706
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:51,008
I could unmask their ploy
in front of father.

707
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:57,842
Nanny! Is there no way for me
to reach my room from here?

708
00:58:57,925 --> 00:58:59,633
It is late.

709
00:59:01,425 --> 00:59:02,758
I'll go, son.

710
00:59:37,717 --> 00:59:41,592
Take this, son. These are
your things. Leave hastily.

711
00:59:42,925 --> 00:59:43,800
Thank you, nanny.

712
00:59:43,883 --> 00:59:46,467
- Kapil will be waiting near the temple.
- Okay.

713
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,050
You are the provider of the light..

714
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:51,383
You are the provider of the light..

715
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:53,842
You are the provider of the light..

716
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:55,776
You are the provider of the light..

717
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,342
Thanks to God! Today you are
rescued from a huge peril.

718
00:59:58,842 --> 01:00:04,508
No, I am not rescued. I am
entrapped in a big difficulty.

719
01:00:06,467 --> 01:00:08,842
The honour of our Suryavansh
dynasty..

720
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,842
The righteousness of my father..

721
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:15,050
Today, there's a blot
on both due to me.

722
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:20,133
If I cannot find the real killer,
then I'll have to wash this..

723
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,467
Blot with my own blood.

724
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:23,175
King, the prince has escaped.

725
01:00:23,258 --> 01:00:25,258
What did you say? The
prince has escaped?

726
01:00:25,342 --> 01:00:29,508
This is false. My son
can never be a coward.

727
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:37,592
- The prince has escaped.
- No! What am I hearing, goddess?

728
01:00:46,925 --> 01:00:50,842
Now where is the justice? That
moment, you were speaking..

729
01:00:50,925 --> 01:00:53,842
A lot of your justice that
you would punish him in a..

730
01:00:53,925 --> 01:00:59,258
Crowded assembly. Now punish
him. Now give justice.

731
01:00:59,467 --> 01:01:01,508
Where is our criminal?

732
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,967
I regret, princess,
the criminal escaped.

733
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:09,842
Did he escape or was
he made to escape?

734
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:10,883
Princess!

735
01:01:16,883 --> 01:01:19,258
O King, I accuse you that you
have abetted the escape..

736
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,217
Of a murderer.

737
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:26,883
Princess, you can tell me
today whatever you want.

738
01:01:29,092 --> 01:01:35,383
I am your criminal. The
shameful act of a son..

739
01:01:36,758 --> 01:01:39,467
Disgraces the most
reputable father.

740
01:01:41,717 --> 01:01:45,508
For the sake of my own justice,
I hand myself over..

741
01:01:45,592 --> 01:01:47,675
To law and regulation.

742
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,633
Hand over to law! We tribal
folk have our own law.

743
01:01:53,217 --> 01:01:56,217
An eye for an eye.
That's our justice.

744
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:03,383
I accept this justice. If your
father's death can be..

745
01:02:03,467 --> 01:02:07,508
Only avenged by someone
else's death, then..

746
01:02:07,883 --> 01:02:13,592
I am prepared to die. Take this.
Take this sword and..

747
01:02:13,675 --> 01:02:15,633
Bury it in my chest.

748
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,842
It will be the law in your land to
kill a father for his son's crime.

749
01:02:22,383 --> 01:02:25,342
In our realm, this injustice isn't
done for the sake of justice.

750
01:02:25,717 --> 01:02:28,217
We only seek our criminal.

751
01:02:29,092 --> 01:02:30,883
Oh my god.

752
01:02:32,217 --> 01:02:38,258
I swear in the name of this sword
that I shall apprehend..

753
01:02:38,342 --> 01:02:42,842
That criminal and punish him
in the severest way possible.

754
01:02:43,383 --> 01:02:47,133
Whether you apprehend him
or us, promise me today..

755
01:02:47,217 --> 01:02:51,008
That now his decision will be
taken not by you, but by us.

756
01:02:51,175 --> 01:02:55,883
We shall punish him. Tell me,
is this agreeable to you?

757
01:02:58,592 --> 01:03:00,258
I agree.

758
01:03:00,342 --> 01:03:04,133
That Toli is Narpat's man.
But what is the proof?

759
01:03:04,925 --> 01:03:10,717
Proof? Yes.. idea.. idea..

760
01:03:11,008 --> 01:03:13,883
Bheemasaran is Narpat's special man.

761
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:17,592
- Why don't we use him?
- How?

762
01:03:17,675 --> 01:03:20,175
Brother.. oh.. brother..

763
01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:22,508
Don't you remember? Bheemasaran..

764
01:03:22,592 --> 01:03:25,675
Was praying to Lord
Hanumana's idol.

765
01:03:25,758 --> 01:03:28,092
That he wants a foolish son -in-law.

766
01:03:28,217 --> 01:03:31,842
Where will he get a better
foolish son-in-law than me?

767
01:03:32,592 --> 01:03:35,175
- You are very smart.
- I am smart, isn't it?

768
01:03:35,258 --> 01:03:37,675
Shall we fulfill his
ambition today, then?

769
01:03:37,758 --> 01:03:39,342
Hanumana will be very happy.

770
01:03:39,425 --> 01:03:41,217
Hail to you, lord Hanumana!

771
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:45,050
I am his foolish son-in-law
from today.

772
01:03:57,508 --> 01:04:00,675
I got him! I got him! I got him!

773
01:04:00,758 --> 01:04:02,342
What did you get? Whom did you find?

774
01:04:02,425 --> 01:04:08,508
- You are the one!
- Who? - I had met in the dream.

775
01:04:08,592 --> 01:04:10,258
Lord Hanumana had introduced me.

776
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:13,300
He told me, son.. he is
your father-in-law.

777
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,300
And I am searching
for you since then.

778
01:04:15,383 --> 01:04:17,758
Champakali was right.

779
01:04:17,842 --> 01:04:20,217
Lord Hanumana told her
this in her dreams too.

780
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,008
Really?

781
01:04:21,092 --> 01:04:22,467
Then please have this couple meet.

782
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:24,633
And call Chanda.

783
01:04:24,717 --> 01:04:26,092
I will call her right now.

784
01:04:26,175 --> 01:04:30,550
My Champakali! My paper flower!

785
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,592
Oh idol of two pounds..
Come out quickly.

786
01:04:32,675 --> 01:04:34,508
Lord Hanumana has sent
a husband for you.

787
01:04:34,592 --> 01:04:37,050
- Coming!
- Come.. come.. come quickly.

788
01:04:40,467 --> 01:04:41,842
Greetings, mother-in-law.

789
01:04:42,092 --> 01:04:43,717
Not mother-in-law..

790
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,217
Father-in-law, you called the bud.

791
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,633
Where did this tree come from?

792
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:53,133
She is my bud, my daughter,
Champakali!

793
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,258
Your daughter.. Champa..

794
01:04:57,383 --> 01:04:59,133
What happened? What happened?

795
01:04:59,217 --> 01:05:00,467
Father..

796
01:05:00,592 --> 01:05:02,633
Why are you staring at me?
Go and get some water!

797
01:05:02,717 --> 01:05:04,443
Son-in-law, what happened to you?
What happened to you?

798
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:05,550
Princess Sangita.

799
01:05:06,008 --> 01:05:09,842
I am as sad as you are about
your father's death.

800
01:05:09,883 --> 01:05:12,467
Wipe these tears away and
strengthen your heart.

801
01:05:12,883 --> 01:05:15,050
You have to become the queen
of this settlement.

802
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,758
No. I cannot take this
burden as of now.

803
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:25,175
It is right, she is so young and
such a huge responsibility.

804
01:05:25,258 --> 01:05:27,092
I am not scared of responsibility.

805
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:29,717
The burning fire in my heart..

806
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,425
Till the time I don't
douse it with..

807
01:05:31,508 --> 01:05:32,967
The blood of my father's killer..

808
01:05:34,967 --> 01:05:36,508
I don't want to become the queen.

809
01:05:36,592 --> 01:05:39,800
This is what duty says.
But princess..

810
01:05:39,842 --> 01:05:42,133
Please don't become blind
in your quest for duty.

811
01:05:42,217 --> 01:05:44,300
We don't know whether you
will get the killer or not.

812
01:05:44,383 --> 01:05:46,175
We will get him. We will
certainly get him.

813
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:48,967
I am sure. The king had
hidden him in the palace.

814
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:53,383
That is possible. But it isn't
simple to reach the palace.

815
01:05:54,842 --> 01:06:00,092
Forge the palace. I will search
him even if he is in hell.

816
01:06:31,675 --> 01:06:34,717
Your majesty. Forget whatever
has happened.

817
01:06:35,008 --> 01:06:36,758
Please think about your health.

818
01:06:37,342 --> 01:06:39,217
So what if Bhanupratap has gone?

819
01:06:40,008 --> 01:06:41,883
Your younger son is still there.

820
01:06:41,967 --> 01:06:44,258
He will take all the
responsibilities of the kingdom.

821
01:06:44,342 --> 01:06:49,550
I am not worried about
my responsibilities.

822
01:06:50,425 --> 01:06:54,467
I am worried.. that in my family..

823
01:06:55,217 --> 01:06:58,592
In my house, such
a person took birth..

824
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:02,508
Who couldn't face justice
and ran away..

825
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:06,050
In the fear of his death.

826
01:07:22,217 --> 01:07:23,508
Attention.

827
01:07:26,133 --> 01:07:29,592
Who are you? You thought
that I was sleeping?

828
01:07:32,717 --> 01:07:37,550
You are a woman. Go, I forgive you.

829
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,258
Brave men don't hit women.

830
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,342
Please, not so loud. The
soldiers are chasing me.

831
01:07:43,425 --> 01:07:46,217
Oh, so you have come in my shelter.

832
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,758
Don't worry. I will
save you. Come here..

833
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,050
Come on, hide here.

834
01:07:56,925 --> 01:07:57,925
What is it?

835
01:07:59,883 --> 01:08:02,425
Sir, did you see any thief
clad in black clothes?

836
01:08:02,508 --> 01:08:05,842
I didn't see any black thief,
a fair maiden came.

837
01:08:05,883 --> 01:08:09,050
She was very hungry, she had
her food and went away.

838
01:08:09,133 --> 01:08:11,717
Oh, the prince is talking
about some cat.

839
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,133
Come on.. we will see that side..

840
01:08:17,091 --> 01:08:18,882
Hey, girl.. get up.

841
01:08:21,675 --> 01:08:25,758
You have saved my life today.
I will repay you one day.

842
01:08:25,841 --> 01:08:29,174
We don't take anything
from women. You can go.

843
01:08:34,466 --> 01:08:36,799
Hey girl!

844
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,800
Hey, who is this?

845
01:10:00,342 --> 01:10:02,633
Hey, man..

846
01:10:02,925 --> 01:10:04,133
Hey..

847
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:11,383
Who are you?

848
01:10:11,467 --> 01:10:16,717
The thief scolds the police?
Who are you?

849
01:10:18,008 --> 01:10:21,217
Me.. I am the soldier of
the princess Sangeeta.

850
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,342
Your princess has such attitude.

851
01:10:24,925 --> 01:10:27,342
Even her soldiers are so delicate.

852
01:10:27,717 --> 01:10:30,300
So slim, such a spicy face..

853
01:10:30,383 --> 01:10:31,800
Do you suspect that I am a soldier?

854
01:10:31,883 --> 01:10:34,383
Not at all.. not at all.

855
01:10:34,467 --> 01:10:35,925
But please tell me..

856
01:10:36,175 --> 01:10:37,425
Where were you running off too?

857
01:10:38,258 --> 01:10:39,925
I was running away from the palace.

858
01:10:40,592 --> 01:10:42,925
The princess has told
me to find out..

859
01:10:43,592 --> 01:10:46,550
Whether the king has
hidden his son there.

860
01:10:47,258 --> 01:10:51,717
Has the princess hidden
the prince in her heart?

861
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,133
The prince? The one who is
running away from justice?

862
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:57,883
Our princess hates that coward!

863
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:03,967
Shoot the coward! Listen
to the request at least.

864
01:11:05,633 --> 01:11:10,133
See.. I saved your life.
Now you save my life too.

865
01:11:10,217 --> 01:11:11,633
Do you have danger to your life?

866
01:11:13,592 --> 01:11:16,800
I have given my heart
to a stone hearted one.

867
01:11:16,842 --> 01:11:18,133
Secretly.

868
01:11:18,883 --> 01:11:19,883
Whom?

869
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:24,800
The one whom God has
made your princess.

870
01:11:25,133 --> 01:11:29,133
Me? I mean.. my princess?

871
01:11:29,217 --> 01:11:31,758
I am just telling you
all this in friendship.

872
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,842
What is so wrong in it?

873
01:11:32,925 --> 01:11:36,300
And do you know, before
I drowned in her love..

874
01:11:36,508 --> 01:11:37,842
I was drowning in the water.

875
01:11:38,342 --> 01:11:41,842
She took me out with
her slender hands.

876
01:11:42,175 --> 01:11:46,217
And as soon as she kept
her head on my chest..

877
01:11:46,758 --> 01:11:51,675
The heartbeats increased,
breaths met breath.

878
01:11:51,758 --> 01:11:55,800
And I felt as if it was some
storm of hot breath..

879
01:11:55,883 --> 01:11:57,217
And I was flying away in it!

880
01:11:59,133 --> 01:12:04,633
My friend.. her eyes saw into
my eyes in such a way..

881
01:12:04,717 --> 01:12:08,967
In such a way..
The heart is still bleeding..

882
01:12:09,342 --> 01:12:14,175
Oh my dear..

883
01:12:14,675 --> 01:12:21,008
Do you know.. if I meet her once
in the loneliness of the night..

884
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:24,967
Do you know what I will do?
Do you know?

885
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:26,383
What will you do?

886
01:12:30,592 --> 01:12:32,508
I will embrace her and say to her..

887
01:12:34,133 --> 01:12:36,758
Queen.. this Bhagatram
is not that much..

888
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,925
A devotee of God,
than he is of you..

889
01:12:40,008 --> 01:12:43,258
My life is in your hands now.
Kill me if you wish.

890
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,467
She will really kill you. She
is a fire, lightning, a curse.

891
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:51,758
Whatever she is..
She is for me now.

892
01:12:52,508 --> 01:12:55,592
Forget it. Forget it, you haven't
fallen in love as yet.

893
01:12:55,675 --> 01:12:58,967
You don't know the pleasure in
dying in your lover's embrace.

894
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:07,300
And then.. I died that day when the
first time she said, Bhagatram..

895
01:13:09,592 --> 01:13:11,758
You are being so excited
in my presence.

896
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,800
Will you show your guts
in her presence too?

897
01:13:16,842 --> 01:13:19,550
I will.. I will certainly do it..

898
01:13:21,383 --> 01:13:22,592
Do it!

899
01:13:23,925 --> 01:13:25,175
Oh god!

900
01:13:25,258 --> 01:13:27,717
I am ruined! I am dead! I am looted!

901
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,967
What is the matter?

902
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:30,300
You seem very scared?

903
01:13:30,383 --> 01:13:33,675
All my hopes have drowned.

904
01:13:33,758 --> 01:13:34,550
What is it?

905
01:13:34,633 --> 01:13:39,383
The princess will become the queen
of the clan tomorrow morning.

906
01:13:39,925 --> 01:13:43,008
Bheemasaran.. the morning
is too far now.

907
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:51,800
A lot can happen in one night. Go.

908
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,342
Bless me, goddess..

909
01:13:54,592 --> 01:13:58,925
The Gods should be pleased
with me in today's prayer.

910
01:13:59,175 --> 01:14:01,175
And give me the strength and worth..

911
01:14:01,258 --> 01:14:03,883
To be the queen of this clan.

912
01:14:55,967 --> 01:14:58,133
"Dance.. oh heart.. dance.."

913
01:14:58,217 --> 01:15:00,050
"Dance with grace.."

914
01:15:00,133 --> 01:15:02,258
"I will dance.. and
you will dance too.."

915
01:15:02,342 --> 01:15:04,133
"Everyone will dance!"

916
01:15:04,217 --> 01:15:06,258
"Dance.. oh heart.. dance.."

917
01:15:06,342 --> 01:15:08,467
"Dance with grace.."

918
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,800
"I will dance.. and
you will dance too.."

919
01:15:10,842 --> 01:15:12,467
"Everyone will dance!"

920
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,633
"Dance.. oh heart.. dance.."

921
01:15:14,717 --> 01:15:16,883
"Dance with grace.."

922
01:15:43,842 --> 01:15:47,883
"My anklet speaks."

923
01:15:47,967 --> 01:15:51,133
"It opens the veils of shyness."

924
01:15:52,258 --> 01:15:55,717
"My anklet speaks."

925
01:15:56,133 --> 01:16:03,550
"My beloved has arrived..
My heart has blossomed!"

926
01:16:04,258 --> 01:16:07,550
My heart has blossomed!"

927
01:16:08,342 --> 01:16:10,342
"Dance.. oh heart.. dance.."

928
01:16:10,425 --> 01:16:12,425
"Dance with grace.."

929
01:16:12,508 --> 01:16:14,467
"I will dance.. and
you will dance too.."

930
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,508
"Everyone will dance!"

931
01:16:16,592 --> 01:16:18,467
"Dance.. oh heart.. dance.."

932
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:20,883
"Dance with grace.."

933
01:16:43,508 --> 01:16:45,967
"The weather is so good."

934
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:50,550
"The one which will
not let us sleep."

935
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:54,758
"The weather is so good."

936
01:16:55,717 --> 01:16:59,383
"My body and soul
are being colored."

937
01:16:59,467 --> 01:17:02,842
"All the colors are so different."

938
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:06,842
"All the colors are so different."

939
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,842
"Dance.. oh heart.. dance.."

940
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,800
"Dance with grace.."

941
01:17:11,967 --> 01:17:13,800
"I will dance.. and
you will dance too.."

942
01:17:13,883 --> 01:17:15,842
"Everyone will dance!"

943
01:17:16,008 --> 01:17:17,800
"Dance.. oh heart.. dance.."

944
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:20,008
"Dance with grace.."

945
01:17:46,258 --> 01:17:50,342
"He wants to take the heart away."

946
01:17:50,425 --> 01:17:53,467
"He wants to have us defeated."

947
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,383
"He wants to take the heart away."

948
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:05,675
"Someone wants to exchange
hearts today.."

949
01:18:06,675 --> 01:18:09,592
"Exchange hearts today.."

950
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,800
"Dance.. oh heart.. dance.."

951
01:18:12,883 --> 01:18:14,883
"Dance with grace.."

952
01:18:14,967 --> 01:18:16,842
"I will dance.. and
you will dance too.."

953
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:18,883
"Everyone will dance!"

954
01:18:18,967 --> 01:18:20,800
"Dance.. oh heart.. dance.."

955
01:18:20,842 --> 01:18:22,925
"Dance with grace.."

956
01:18:23,008 --> 01:18:24,925
"I will dance.. and
you will dance too.."

957
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,883
"Everyone will dance!"

958
01:18:27,092 --> 01:18:28,842
"Dance.. oh heart.. dance.."

959
01:18:28,925 --> 01:18:31,133
"Dance with grace.."

960
01:18:46,425 --> 01:18:47,693
Tell me, why have you
brought me here?

961
01:18:47,717 --> 01:18:49,092
That is the order of our master.

962
01:18:49,175 --> 01:18:52,050
And who is your master?
That wretched prince?

963
01:18:52,133 --> 01:18:53,133
No.

964
01:18:53,258 --> 01:18:54,342
Your servant.

965
01:18:54,425 --> 01:18:55,508
You?

966
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,800
Yes.

967
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:00,300
Why are you standing? Have a seat.

968
01:19:02,342 --> 01:19:04,092
I ask you, why did
you bring me here?

969
01:19:04,175 --> 01:19:05,467
What do you wish of me?

970
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:07,925
I wish a lot.

971
01:19:08,008 --> 01:19:09,883
I wish to embrace this lightning.

972
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:11,925
But I have got the chance today.

973
01:19:12,008 --> 01:19:13,467
How dare you!

974
01:19:14,217 --> 01:19:15,300
Don't come ahead.

975
01:19:15,842 --> 01:19:17,258
I tell you, don't come ahead.

976
01:19:17,342 --> 01:19:20,592
Narpat Singh doesn't
know how to go back.

977
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:26,092
Foolish woman, do you know
the punishment for this?

978
01:19:26,258 --> 01:19:27,717
Slavery for life!

979
01:19:27,842 --> 01:19:29,800
We haven't learnt that till today.

980
01:19:29,842 --> 01:19:32,217
I will teach you what
you haven't today.

981
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,633
I want to marry this girl right now.

982
01:19:36,717 --> 01:19:38,383
- Bring some priest.
- As you say.

983
01:19:38,758 --> 01:19:40,967
And take her away, and
make her a bride.

984
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:44,758
I tell you, don't touch me.
Let me go! Let me go!

985
01:19:44,842 --> 01:19:47,383
Let me go! Let me go!

986
01:20:01,383 --> 01:20:03,050
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, it is ready.

987
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:09,550
Where is the prince?
I want to bless him..

988
01:20:11,258 --> 01:20:13,175
Sir.. he is not here.. he is there.

989
01:20:13,258 --> 01:20:16,842
Prince. You live long.

990
01:20:16,925 --> 01:20:19,800
It is our good fortune
that we have..

991
01:20:19,842 --> 01:20:23,217
Got a chance to serve you.

992
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:25,342
That is all right, quickly.

993
01:20:25,425 --> 01:20:29,467
Please come.. we are waiting
for you to sit.

994
01:20:30,217 --> 01:20:32,633
He doesn't even let us touch her.

995
01:20:32,717 --> 01:20:34,037
She comes to hit us and all that.

996
01:20:34,092 --> 01:20:35,633
Drag her out!

997
01:20:35,717 --> 01:20:40,550
Please cool.. sir.. cool.. this
is a marriage ceremony.

998
01:20:40,633 --> 01:20:43,592
It isn't good to be so angry.

999
01:20:43,675 --> 01:20:48,800
- The mother of the girl..
- Mother.. - Mother..

1000
01:20:48,883 --> 01:20:54,092
Tell the mother of the girl to
convince her daughter to come.

1001
01:20:54,175 --> 01:20:55,675
The girl doesn't have any parents.

1002
01:20:56,008 --> 01:21:00,217
So what? We are everything
to the girl.

1003
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,675
Son Bharat.. you arrange
for the prayers.

1004
01:21:04,758 --> 01:21:08,217
I will convince the girl to come.

1005
01:21:11,175 --> 01:21:13,425
Show the blind man the way..

1006
01:21:13,508 --> 01:21:14,592
Take Surdas away..

1007
01:21:16,175 --> 01:21:20,925
Come.. please come.. please come..

1008
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:31,383
Whoever is with the girl,
tell them to go away.

1009
01:21:31,467 --> 01:21:34,800
Go away from here! I tell
you, go away from here!

1010
01:21:34,883 --> 01:21:37,217
Calm down, child. Calm down, child.

1011
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,758
I don't want to marry!

1012
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:43,342
This is not your mistake, child.

1013
01:21:43,425 --> 01:21:49,133
A woman becomes emotional
during her marriage.

1014
01:21:49,217 --> 01:21:52,758
You should be happy that you got..

1015
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,717
Such a nice husband as Narpat.

1016
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,008
He is a wretch.

1017
01:21:59,092 --> 01:22:01,842
Please don't say like that.

1018
01:22:01,925 --> 01:22:05,050
Agree to the power of the almighty.

1019
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:08,508
There is no way out
other than marriage.

1020
01:22:08,592 --> 01:22:11,133
There is.. a woman wishes
to save her dignity.

1021
01:22:11,758 --> 01:22:15,258
- I will kill myself before this marriage.
- Sangita!

1022
01:22:16,675 --> 01:22:18,967
Who are you?

1023
01:22:20,133 --> 01:22:21,217
Please apply this..

1024
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,925
Sir.. everything is ready here.

1025
01:22:24,008 --> 01:22:25,800
The maiden is ready too!

1026
01:22:25,842 --> 01:22:28,175
Start the good deed.

1027
01:22:28,258 --> 01:22:30,675
Did you see his magic?

1028
01:22:30,758 --> 01:22:32,800
We will start the program now.

1029
01:22:40,092 --> 01:22:41,092
What is this?

1030
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:50,042
"In this changing world.."

1031
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:55,000
"A person's intentions
are not correct."

1032
01:23:55,042 --> 01:23:59,750
"Don't come out all dressed up.."

1033
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:04,833
"A person's intentions
are not correct."

1034
01:24:04,917 --> 01:24:09,500
"In this changing world.."

1035
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:14,333
"A person's intentions
are not correct."

1036
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:18,667
"Don't come out all dressed up.."

1037
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:23,500
"A person's intentions
are not correct."

1038
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:29,083
"In this changing world.."

1039
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:44,458
"Move your head from my shoulder."

1040
01:24:44,542 --> 01:24:49,250
"Forget this love and romance."

1041
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:54,083
"Move your head from my shoulder."

1042
01:24:54,167 --> 01:24:59,000
"Forget this love and romance."

1043
01:24:59,042 --> 01:25:03,375
"Save the boat from the waves."

1044
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:08,250
"The storm doesn't have
good intentions."

1045
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:12,792
"In this changing world.."

1046
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:17,625
"A person's intentions
are not correct."

1047
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:22,125
"Don't come out all dressed up.."

1048
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:26,958
"A person's intentions
are not correct."

1049
01:25:27,042 --> 01:25:32,542
"In this changing world.."

1050
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:50,458
"How can I bid you farewell?"

1051
01:25:50,542 --> 01:25:55,458
"I don't believe in anyone."

1052
01:25:55,542 --> 01:25:59,750
"How can I bid you farewell?"

1053
01:25:59,833 --> 01:26:04,333
"I don't believe in anyone."

1054
01:26:04,417 --> 01:26:12,417
"Hide in my eyes.. God doesn't
have proper intentions."

1055
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:18,000
"In this changing world.."

1056
01:26:18,042 --> 01:26:22,875
"A person's intentions
are not correct."

1057
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:27,333
"Don't come out all dressed up.."

1058
01:26:27,417 --> 01:26:32,167
"A person's intentions
are not correct."

1059
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:37,875
"In this changing world.."

1060
01:26:38,333 --> 01:26:40,208
We do not know where
the princess is.

1061
01:26:40,292 --> 01:26:42,875
Therefore, you will have
to become the chief..

1062
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:44,167
Me.. me..

1063
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:48,125
The goddess will be happy.

1064
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:51,333
Wait!

1065
01:26:55,167 --> 01:26:56,500
Oh god..

1066
01:26:56,583 --> 01:26:58,792
I am unfortunate here too.

1067
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:05,083
Hail to the princess!
Hail to the princess!

1068
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:06,792
You have come at the right time.

1069
01:27:06,875 --> 01:27:08,708
Please come, princess.

1070
01:27:10,042 --> 01:27:13,583
The Goddess heard me and did
away with the problem.

1071
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:17,792
Or else.. how could I take
such a huge responsibility?

1072
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:21,417
Princess.. for the clan.. you know..

1073
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:25,083
What about my heart, I can
sacrifice my life too!

1074
01:27:25,167 --> 01:27:27,458
What are you staring at? Take
her and prepare her..

1075
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:30,958
Go..

1076
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:38,542
Hail to the princess!
Hail to the princess!

1077
01:27:40,542 --> 01:27:42,083
Hail to the chief!

1078
01:27:42,542 --> 01:27:44,958
Hail to the chief!

1079
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:47,958
Hail to the chief!

1080
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:58,667
Goddess.. I promise you in
the presence of my clan..

1081
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:02,375
I will avenge my father's death.

1082
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:08,667
And I will clean your feet
with the murderer's blood.

1083
01:28:10,792 --> 01:28:12,500
Please bless me, goddess.

1084
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:20,708
Hail to the queen!

1085
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:25,583
Unknown young man.. you have
saved the queen last night.

1086
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:29,083
Therefore, the clan of Angkor
is grateful to you.

1087
01:28:29,708 --> 01:28:33,208
You can ask me anything
that you want.

1088
01:28:33,292 --> 01:28:38,750
Thank you, But in our clan, men
don't ask prices for gratitude.

1089
01:28:39,042 --> 01:28:43,792
But we will always be indebted
to this gratitude.

1090
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:48,250
You can ask me to repay this
debt anytime that you wish.

1091
01:28:49,292 --> 01:28:50,750
Thank you.

1092
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,458
And I pray..

1093
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:55,167
Till the time your wound
doesn't subside..

1094
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:57,375
You stay with us as our guest.

1095
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,625
As you say so, Queen.

1096
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:04,333
Wait!

1097
01:29:04,875 --> 01:29:06,792
I want to promise something
to you too.

1098
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:09,875
Till the time I don't
apprehend the killer..

1099
01:29:09,958 --> 01:29:12,875
Of your chief, and don't
kill him, I won't rest.

1100
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:14,958
Bless him, queen.

1101
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:16,875
Hail to the stranger!

1102
01:29:23,417 --> 01:29:27,458
They are not the king's men.
They are some outsiders.

1103
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:29,708
Their names are Bhagatram
and Jagatram.

1104
01:29:29,792 --> 01:29:31,667
And both of them have
stayed there as guests.

1105
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:35,458
The people who have
had the princess..

1106
01:29:36,083 --> 01:29:37,351
Escape at the last moment,
cannot be crazy.

1107
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:38,667
Crazy?

1108
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:44,042
They are not crazy, sir..
They are very smart!

1109
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,708
They cursed my fate. See.

1110
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:50,667
I prepared a new costume
to become the chief.

1111
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:53,167
Now, I will set it afire
with my own hands.

1112
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:55,208
Why are you crying, Bheemasaran?

1113
01:29:55,417 --> 01:29:57,458
Keep this costume carefully.

1114
01:29:57,667 --> 01:30:01,417
Narpat is alive till now,
keep an eye on those two.

1115
01:30:01,792 --> 01:30:03,917
And catch them as soon
as you get a chance.

1116
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:07,083
But how will you catch them?
The princess..

1117
01:30:07,167 --> 01:30:09,083
Keeps them with her all the time.

1118
01:30:09,167 --> 01:30:12,333
- With her?
- Yes. - In her house? - Yes.

1119
01:30:13,417 --> 01:30:16,417
You fool, defame the
princess in the clan.

1120
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:18,125
She will chuck them out herself.

1121
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:21,708
Very good!

1122
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:25,792
I will see how they
escape from me now.

1123
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:30,125
See.. my costume looks
so well on you.

1124
01:30:35,542 --> 01:30:40,292
- It looks very good, I look like a prisoner.
- Prisoner?

1125
01:30:40,375 --> 01:30:43,500
Yes. Wearing this, I
will be a subject..

1126
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:45,875
On whom you will always rule.

1127
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:52,500
You just look at my rule,
can't you see my love?

1128
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:58,875
If you say that this relation
is love.. no.

1129
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:01,083
Please excuse me and let me go.

1130
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:03,625
I have a lot of other works.

1131
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:07,875
- What are the other works?
- There are many others!

1132
01:31:07,958 --> 01:31:11,417
The fields are drying up,
we have to water them.

1133
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:15,042
We have to hoe the field.
And do you know?

1134
01:31:16,333 --> 01:31:17,333
What?

1135
01:31:17,625 --> 01:31:21,250
I left my bed on the terrace
while coming here.

1136
01:31:22,167 --> 01:31:24,125
I think about again and again.

1137
01:31:24,208 --> 01:31:25,500
I am sitting here, and there..

1138
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:27,792
The dogs of the whole village must..

1139
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:30,208
Be sleeping on that
bed very nicely.

1140
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:34,583
Then.. you think more
of that bed than me.

1141
01:31:34,667 --> 01:31:40,042
- I think more of that bed for you.
- Why is that?

1142
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:42,292
Because when you come to
my house after marriage..

1143
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:45,667
I only have that bed
to have you sleep in.

1144
01:32:04,625 --> 01:32:07,042
This person cannot live
in our queen's house.

1145
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:09,958
We will not tolerate it!
Throw him out!

1146
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,667
Throw him out!

1147
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:24,667
What kind of noise is this?
Who should be thrown out?

1148
01:32:24,792 --> 01:32:27,458
The members of the clan wish that..

1149
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:29,583
- You should throw that stranger out.
- Why?

1150
01:32:31,667 --> 01:32:33,507
Answer me. Why should I
have him throw him out?

1151
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:37,958
Because a stranger cannot live
in our queen's house like this.

1152
01:32:38,042 --> 01:32:39,792
This is shameful!

1153
01:32:39,875 --> 01:32:42,542
The person who was wounded
while saving my life..

1154
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:45,958
Is it a matter of shame to
keep him home as a guest?

1155
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:49,208
The respect of the clan,
our duty and religion..

1156
01:32:49,292 --> 01:32:51,292
Does it say that the one who has..

1157
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:54,583
Helped us so much, we should..

1158
01:32:54,667 --> 01:32:56,587
Insult them and throw
them out of the village?

1159
01:32:57,417 --> 01:32:59,333
The one who was wounded
for my sake..

1160
01:32:59,792 --> 01:33:01,392
I should throw him
out on the streets?

1161
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:04,958
Does this hold the
pride of the clan?

1162
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,208
Tell me. Answer me.

1163
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:10,958
We don't mind if you
make him a guest.

1164
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:12,458
Then, what do you mind?

1165
01:33:12,542 --> 01:33:14,458
We have a problem with the fact..

1166
01:33:14,542 --> 01:33:16,143
That he is trying to be
a owner from a guest.

1167
01:33:16,167 --> 01:33:19,125
He is trying to marry our queen.

1168
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:21,417
He doesn't need to dream all that.

1169
01:33:21,917 --> 01:33:24,958
The one who saved my life,
if he wished so..

1170
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,542
He could have ordered me
to marry him the same day.

1171
01:33:29,792 --> 01:33:32,292
But he is a brave and honest man.

1172
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,792
He felt that using our customs
and traditions..

1173
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:36,917
Is against his pride
and sincerity.

1174
01:33:37,042 --> 01:33:42,125
This means that not him.. our
queen is mad in his love.

1175
01:33:42,208 --> 01:33:44,292
Does a queen not have
a right to love?

1176
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:48,125
If every woman of the clan has
a right to choose her husband..

1177
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:50,625
Does the queen of the
clan not have that right?

1178
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:52,083
And what about the promise that..

1179
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:54,167
The queen has taken
that she will..

1180
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,650
Not marry until and unless she..

1181
01:33:55,708 --> 01:33:57,548
Finds out about the murderers
of her father?

1182
01:33:57,708 --> 01:33:59,000
That promise still exists.

1183
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:01,958
Therefore, your queen didn't
marry till today.

1184
01:34:02,708 --> 01:34:04,500
And believe me. Your queen will..

1185
01:34:04,583 --> 01:34:08,542
Not marry till the time she
doesn't fulfill that promise.

1186
01:34:11,167 --> 01:34:12,500
Do you want to ask anything else?

1187
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:14,625
You people can go.

1188
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:25,458
Ram..

1189
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,625
What are you doing?

1190
01:34:27,708 --> 01:34:28,792
I am going.

1191
01:34:29,167 --> 01:34:30,000
Why?

1192
01:34:30,042 --> 01:34:32,500
You will not marry me now.
What will I do being here?

1193
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:34,625
You know that I am helpless.

1194
01:34:36,333 --> 01:34:41,458
The prince is standing like
a wall between our marriages.

1195
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:45,708
The day I offer his
blood to my Gods..

1196
01:34:47,208 --> 01:34:50,083
I will give myself up
to you the same day.

1197
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:51,559
I don't know when you will do that.

1198
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:53,292
My fields will dry
off ill that time.

1199
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:58,708
That day is not far. My
people are all around.

1200
01:34:59,417 --> 01:35:02,083
He cannot escape from
my clutches now.

1201
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:04,250
And even if he does escape
from your clutches..

1202
01:35:04,333 --> 01:35:06,875
He cannot escape from my clutches.

1203
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:10,792
- Wait.. will you not stop?
- No.

1204
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:13,125
Do you know that I am a queen here?

1205
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:15,500
I can order you to stop.

1206
01:35:17,583 --> 01:35:20,667
Even I am a prince, of
the land of the heart.

1207
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:23,170
I am not accustomed to listen
to anyone's orders.

1208
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:24,708
Farewell.

1209
01:35:27,792 --> 01:35:29,292
Ram..

1210
01:35:29,375 --> 01:35:30,542
Farewell!

1211
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:53,625
What is this? What it this going on?

1212
01:35:54,083 --> 01:35:55,417
What insolence is this?

1213
01:36:37,833 --> 01:36:41,375
Didn't I tell you? I am a queen.

1214
01:36:41,875 --> 01:36:44,833
Yes, you are just a queen.

1215
01:36:46,083 --> 01:36:47,875
What do you mean?

1216
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:51,500
This means that you are just
a queen, not a woman.

1217
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:54,917
Saving your life has become
so troublesome for me.

1218
01:36:55,667 --> 01:36:58,833
The people defame the wolf
needlessly when you are here.

1219
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:01,000
By naming them for conning
and fooling.

1220
01:37:01,583 --> 01:37:03,833
People too!

1221
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:07,375
They call the tiger a
brutal heartless person..

1222
01:37:07,458 --> 01:37:09,375
When you are here too!

1223
01:37:09,458 --> 01:37:10,809
You would have seen my brutality..

1224
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:13,917
If my hands weren't
tied like this!

1225
01:37:16,125 --> 01:37:18,250
Okay, I will have you untied.

1226
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,167
Untie him.

1227
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:26,208
You are committing a mistake,
you will repent.

1228
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:28,583
Undo him.

1229
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:31,750
I will not be able to
do to a princess..

1230
01:37:31,833 --> 01:37:35,083
- What is done to a woman! I will!
- Kill me?

1231
01:37:38,125 --> 01:37:39,208
What will you do?

1232
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,667
"Beloved.."

1233
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:13,042
"Do this to my heart.."

1234
01:38:14,042 --> 01:38:22,042
"Even we burnt in the fire of love,
walked on the fire of love."

1235
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:36,250
"Do this to my heart..
Keep doing it.."

1236
01:38:39,167 --> 01:38:47,125
"Even we burnt in the fire of love,
walked on the fire of love."

1237
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,167
"What should I tell you..

1238
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:18,708
About the state of the heart
since I have met you.."

1239
01:39:19,375 --> 01:39:27,375
"Just like a thousand lighthings
fell and we were on fire!"

1240
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:37,042
"Why do you want to ruin me?"

1241
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:41,958
"How have I hurt you?"

1242
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:46,042
"Beloved.."

1243
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:54,083
"Do this to my heart.."

1244
01:39:55,167 --> 01:40:03,125
"Even we burnt in the fire of love,
walked on the fire of love."

1245
01:40:26,708 --> 01:40:30,958
"There is a sweet pain in my body."

1246
01:40:31,042 --> 01:40:35,042
"My heart writhes."

1247
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:43,250
"You will kill me in
one blow, my killer!"

1248
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:52,042
"The depths of the heart..
Drowning in this pain.."

1249
01:40:53,167 --> 01:40:57,625
"This pain.. this hunger.."

1250
01:40:59,917 --> 01:41:01,292
"Beloved.."

1251
01:41:01,667 --> 01:41:09,667
"Do this to my heart.."

1252
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:19,000
"Even we burnt in the fire of love,
walked on the fire of love."

1253
01:41:42,667 --> 01:41:50,458
"You are so near the heart today..
Like my heartbeat."

1254
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:59,000
"Our heart and soul
are together now."

1255
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:03,708
"Two roses have bloomed together."

1256
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:08,708
"Two pearls have come up together."

1257
01:42:09,792 --> 01:42:13,958
"Two hearts have beat together."

1258
01:42:15,292 --> 01:42:17,417
"Beloved.."

1259
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:25,500
"Do this to my heart.."

1260
01:42:26,167 --> 01:42:34,167
"Even we burnt in the fire of love,
walked on the fire of love."

1261
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,292
"Beloved.."

1262
01:42:42,625 --> 01:42:50,625
"Do this to my heart.."

1263
01:42:51,542 --> 01:42:59,542
"Even we burnt in the fire of love,
walked on the fire of love."

1264
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:31,750
My solders, please drink this
Drink this. Drink this.

1265
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,417
Say hail to the King Bheemasaran!

1266
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,375
Say it!

1267
01:43:43,167 --> 01:43:49,542
Do you know the meaning
of accepting our orders?

1268
01:43:49,583 --> 01:43:52,542
We will ruin everyone!

1269
01:43:52,917 --> 01:43:53,958
Say it!

1270
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:56,042
Hail to the king!

1271
01:43:56,625 --> 01:43:59,042
Your son-in-law, father-in-law.

1272
01:43:59,125 --> 01:44:04,458
My son-in-law.. bless
you. Bless you.

1273
01:44:04,542 --> 01:44:06,667
When I become the king, I will..

1274
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:09,500
Give you whatever
reward you want..

1275
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:11,375
For saying hail in my name.

1276
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:13,792
Will you be a king under
this intoxication?

1277
01:44:13,875 --> 01:44:15,292
Or will you ever really be a king?

1278
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:23,000
I will be the chief of my
clan after some days.

1279
01:44:28,125 --> 01:44:31,583
Why are you crying?
Why are you crying?

1280
01:44:31,667 --> 01:44:35,542
If you become the chief, the
prince will shoot you.

1281
01:44:35,625 --> 01:44:42,583
Do you think that the prince
shot the previous chief?

1282
01:44:42,667 --> 01:44:45,750
Then, father-in-law,
who shot the chief?

1283
01:44:45,833 --> 01:44:49,667
He shot him..

1284
01:44:50,042 --> 01:44:54,292
This is a secret.
Don't tell anyone.

1285
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:56,250
That bullet..

1286
01:44:58,375 --> 01:44:59,917
Father-in-law..

1287
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,917
Oh now..

1288
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,958
The matter is incomplete
once again today.

1289
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:08,083
Who said that the matter
is incomplete?

1290
01:45:08,167 --> 01:45:10,000
Everything will be complete today.

1291
01:45:10,083 --> 01:45:11,917
- Don't you remember?
- What is this?

1292
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:15,958
This it the wedding garland.
It is forty days today.

1293
01:45:16,042 --> 01:45:17,226
You will be marrying me today.

1294
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:19,458
It is our marriage night today.
Please make me wear it.

1295
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:22,458
Please bring some almond
milk for me from inside.

1296
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,083
I will drink it and
then garland you.

1297
01:45:24,167 --> 01:45:25,000
Almond milk?

1298
01:45:25,083 --> 01:45:26,726
I will bring it right away.
Why are you scared?

1299
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:27,750
Bring it.

1300
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:34,833
Prince.. prince..

1301
01:45:34,917 --> 01:45:36,000
What is the news?

1302
01:45:36,083 --> 01:45:38,750
What can I tell you? The matter
was incomplete like everyday.

1303
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:39,333
Why?

1304
01:45:39,417 --> 01:45:41,167
That man got intoxicated
once again.

1305
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:44,125
But one this for sure that
Bhemasaran knows everything.

1306
01:45:44,208 --> 01:45:45,833
Whatever he said is in this.

1307
01:45:46,333 --> 01:45:48,101
Why don't you try stay
there for some time more?

1308
01:45:48,125 --> 01:45:51,958
No, I will not go there again.
Actually, my forty days are over.

1309
01:45:52,042 --> 01:45:54,917
Now, if I go there, I will
be tied to that fat cannon.

1310
01:46:00,333 --> 01:46:02,958
Then we will have to think of
some other plan for Bhemasaran.

1311
01:46:09,292 --> 01:46:11,792
You broke the relation
of love and went away.

1312
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:15,833
But my life is this relation now.

1313
01:46:17,042 --> 01:46:18,500
How can I just break this relation?

1314
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:24,042
Queen, a very wise sage has
arrived. He knows everything.

1315
01:46:24,125 --> 01:46:27,500
Please come to meet him. He will
drive all your sadness away.

1316
01:46:27,917 --> 01:46:28,625
Please come.

1317
01:46:28,708 --> 01:46:30,292
The queen has arrived.

1318
01:46:30,375 --> 01:46:32,542
The queen has arrived.

1319
01:46:35,458 --> 01:46:40,000
Sir.. the queen here
has come to meet you.

1320
01:46:43,542 --> 01:46:48,083
The queen had to arrive. Her
companion has separated.

1321
01:46:48,167 --> 01:46:50,750
Yes, sir. This woman is very sad.

1322
01:46:52,167 --> 01:46:57,625
Child, are you not
sad for your lover?

1323
01:46:57,708 --> 01:46:59,792
Om!

1324
01:47:01,833 --> 01:47:06,333
Child, you have given
him too much sadness.

1325
01:47:06,417 --> 01:47:07,250
No, sir.

1326
01:47:07,333 --> 01:47:13,875
Child! You had him tied up!
Showed him your strength!

1327
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:21,333
You don't get a lover by strength,
you get him by devotion.

1328
01:47:21,417 --> 01:47:26,458
- I am sorry.
- You will have to apologize to him.

1329
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,250
Where is he?

1330
01:47:28,333 --> 01:47:32,333
He is very far away. But
the great sage Nagraj..

1331
01:47:32,417 --> 01:47:35,250
- Can call him.
- Then please have this mercy on me..

1332
01:47:35,333 --> 01:47:39,500
I will. I will surely
have mercy on you.

1333
01:47:47,958 --> 01:47:50,417
Your work has been done.

1334
01:47:51,667 --> 01:47:55,667
You will meet your lover
tomorrow morning.

1335
01:47:58,042 --> 01:48:00,500
Om..

1336
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:44,708
"You called us.. and we came.."

1337
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:50,042
"With our heart at risk.."

1338
01:48:50,417 --> 01:48:55,083
"You called us.. and we came.."

1339
01:48:55,167 --> 01:49:00,042
"With our heart at risk.."

1340
01:49:00,125 --> 01:49:05,083
"You called us.. and we came.."

1341
01:49:05,167 --> 01:49:10,250
"With our life at risk.."

1342
01:49:10,333 --> 01:49:15,000
"You called us.. and we came.."

1343
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:40,333
"Please come to me now.."

1344
01:49:40,917 --> 01:49:47,583
"Keep this coolness
on my burning eyes."

1345
01:49:48,042 --> 01:49:55,500
"Oh the queen of my
dreams of love.."

1346
01:49:55,917 --> 01:50:03,000
"Why are your lips trembling,
tell me something!"

1347
01:50:03,083 --> 01:50:08,042
"You called us.. and we came.."

1348
01:50:08,542 --> 01:50:13,625
"With our life at risk.."

1349
01:50:13,708 --> 01:50:18,500
"You called us.. and we came.."

1350
01:50:44,875 --> 01:50:50,792
"It is because of you my
story is so famous.."

1351
01:50:51,167 --> 01:50:57,417
"Leading your life with
honesty is called life.."

1352
01:50:58,083 --> 01:51:05,375
"If you didn't meet me.."

1353
01:51:05,458 --> 01:51:12,917
"People would take the coffin
away of your lover."

1354
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:18,417
"You called us.. and we came.."

1355
01:51:18,542 --> 01:51:23,542
"With our life at risk.."

1356
01:51:23,625 --> 01:51:28,500
"You called us.. and we came.."

1357
01:51:28,542 --> 01:51:33,417
"With our life at risk.."

1358
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:38,292
"You called us.. and we came.."

1359
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:43,000
"With our heart at risk.."

1360
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:48,792
"You called us.. and we came.."

1361
01:51:51,833 --> 01:51:59,833
Ram.. Ram..

1362
01:52:00,958 --> 01:52:06,500
- Sage.. Sage..
- Silent.. child.. silent..

1363
01:52:07,292 --> 01:52:12,083
- I know everything.. - But..
- Brace yourself.. brace yourself!

1364
01:52:12,583 --> 01:52:17,667
Nagraj, maybe this foolish
queen doesn't believe me.

1365
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:22,125
Please show her.. what a
melodious voice she has..

1366
01:52:22,208 --> 01:52:27,208
"You called us.."

1367
01:52:27,583 --> 01:52:32,875
"We came with our life at risk.."

1368
01:52:32,958 --> 01:52:37,667
"You called us.."

1369
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:42,750
"We came with our life at risk.."

1370
01:52:42,958 --> 01:52:45,042
"You called us.."

1371
01:52:45,125 --> 01:52:47,333
"And we came.."

1372
01:52:47,417 --> 01:52:51,833
Hail to Nagraj.. hail to Nagraj..
Tell me o queen.

1373
01:52:52,458 --> 01:52:54,333
Do you believe in me now?

1374
01:52:54,417 --> 01:52:58,375
Sir, I didn't come to speak
about not believing you.

1375
01:52:59,458 --> 01:53:05,542
Believe me. One day, you
will get your Bhagatram.

1376
01:53:05,625 --> 01:53:06,750
But when..

1377
01:53:06,833 --> 01:53:09,000
Nagraj doesn't wish
to tell that now.

1378
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:14,208
The moment your father's
killer is found..

1379
01:53:14,292 --> 01:53:19,458
You will get your beloved
at that time..

1380
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:21,333
Oh.. great sage!

1381
01:53:21,417 --> 01:53:25,042
Om Namah Shivay.

1382
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:39,875
All the people have come, but
the real bird hasn't arrived.

1383
01:53:40,042 --> 01:53:45,667
Sir.. we are having a
great propaganda now.

1384
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:48,833
See.. he will be trapped one day.

1385
01:53:48,917 --> 01:53:50,958
But please do it quickly. I cannot..

1386
01:53:51,042 --> 01:53:53,833
Bear this pain of
separation anymore.

1387
01:53:53,917 --> 01:53:58,083
As you wish, o great sage. I
will go and try something.

1388
01:53:58,167 --> 01:54:00,167
- Go quickly..
- I will go right away!

1389
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:05,208
I do not agree to these con men.

1390
01:54:05,292 --> 01:54:06,958
There are many men who just move..

1391
01:54:07,042 --> 01:54:09,125
About dressed as sages
in this world.

1392
01:54:09,208 --> 01:54:11,083
Beg for forgiveness,
beg for forgiveness.

1393
01:54:11,167 --> 01:54:13,250
If the sage hears it, I don't
know what will happen.

1394
01:54:13,333 --> 01:54:15,292
We are hearing everything.

1395
01:54:15,375 --> 01:54:20,833
I will finish the person who doesn't
believe me in a one swift blow.

1396
01:54:20,917 --> 01:54:25,458
Please forgive me, Nagraj..
I committed a..

1397
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,125
I committed a mistake!

1398
01:54:27,208 --> 01:54:30,667
You will have to repent for that.

1399
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:33,458
I will.. I will do whatever
you tell me to.

1400
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:37,292
If this is the matter, then come
in the middle of the night..

1401
01:54:37,375 --> 01:54:41,708
Shave half your moustache,
and bring half a coconut..

1402
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,500
Come to pray to me. Om!

1403
01:54:47,292 --> 01:54:49,542
Half a moustache!

1404
01:54:52,042 --> 01:54:54,042
The bird has arrived..

1405
01:54:55,875 --> 01:54:57,500
Hail Murari!

1406
01:54:57,542 --> 01:55:03,542
Hail Murari!

1407
01:55:04,125 --> 01:55:07,875
Wait.. don't touch this door
with your sinful hand.

1408
01:55:07,958 --> 01:55:09,583
But, sir.

1409
01:55:09,667 --> 01:55:11,792
I have taken the permission
of the Nagraj..

1410
01:55:11,875 --> 01:55:14,958
And come with half a
moustache at midnight..

1411
01:55:15,042 --> 01:55:19,750
- Half a coconut and half a.. I have come to meet you.
- I know.

1412
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:22,375
So you have come to repent?

1413
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:24,875
But you cannot come this way.

1414
01:55:24,958 --> 01:55:27,125
How should I come then?

1415
01:55:27,208 --> 01:55:29,833
Kneel.

1416
01:55:29,917 --> 01:55:32,292
- Okay.
- Not here, there.

1417
01:55:32,667 --> 01:55:33,667
Here..

1418
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,042
Catch your ears.

1419
01:55:39,208 --> 01:55:40,583
Not like this.

1420
01:55:41,167 --> 01:55:42,667
Open the door.

1421
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:44,333
Sir..

1422
01:55:48,208 --> 01:55:49,542
Sir.. sir..

1423
01:55:49,583 --> 01:55:54,208
Sinner! Were you taunting
the Naguru?

1424
01:55:54,292 --> 01:55:57,417
Sir, I committed a mistake,
please forgive me.

1425
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,750
How many mistakes will
you have forgiven?

1426
01:56:00,458 --> 01:56:03,000
You want to become the king here?

1427
01:56:03,417 --> 01:56:06,500
You want to have your
queen murdered?

1428
01:56:06,583 --> 01:56:08,875
No.. no.. not at all.

1429
01:56:08,958 --> 01:56:10,750
Don't lie!

1430
01:56:11,375 --> 01:56:17,375
Nagraj.. show the real
face of this betrayer.

1431
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,042
Speak..

1432
01:56:19,125 --> 01:56:24,792
What do you think? That the prince
shot the previous chief?

1433
01:56:24,875 --> 01:56:27,833
Then, father-in-law.
Who had shot him?

1434
01:56:28,125 --> 01:56:30,000
Shot..

1435
01:56:30,083 --> 01:56:34,292
This is a secret. Don't tell anyone.

1436
01:56:34,375 --> 01:56:36,250
Sir.. please forgive me.

1437
01:56:36,333 --> 01:56:37,542
I should forgive you?

1438
01:56:37,625 --> 01:56:40,125
I should forgive such
a person whose..

1439
01:56:40,208 --> 01:56:42,750
Hands are marked with
the blood of his chief?

1440
01:56:42,833 --> 01:56:45,792
I should forgive him?
That is impossible.

1441
01:56:45,917 --> 01:56:48,833
But sir, I didn't kill the chief.

1442
01:56:49,625 --> 01:56:52,000
Then.. who killed him?

1443
01:56:52,292 --> 01:56:54,208
Narpat Singh committed the murder.

1444
01:56:54,292 --> 01:56:58,750
He had disguised himself
and shot the chief.

1445
01:56:59,667 --> 01:57:03,000
But why did you lie in the
presence of the king?

1446
01:57:04,208 --> 01:57:06,667
To have the prince hanged.

1447
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:07,417
Why?

1448
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:10,208
Because Narpat will become king..

1449
01:57:10,292 --> 01:57:12,958
After finishing off the king
once the prince is dead.

1450
01:57:13,042 --> 01:57:14,792
And he will make me
the chief of the clan.

1451
01:57:14,875 --> 01:57:17,667
Sin! A very big sin!

1452
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:21,208
- Jeevanan.
- Yes, hermit.

1453
01:57:21,292 --> 01:57:24,458
What punishment should
I give to this sinner?

1454
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:29,208
Keep such a sinner in your
pious abode for today.

1455
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:31,458
All right.. all right..

1456
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:38,333
And you.. take Nagraj to the king.

1457
01:57:38,417 --> 01:57:41,125
Good.. good.. good.

1458
01:57:41,292 --> 01:57:43,208
Narpat Singh committed the murder.

1459
01:57:43,292 --> 01:57:47,375
He had disguised himself
and shot the chief.

1460
01:57:47,458 --> 01:57:50,667
But why did you lie in the
presence of the king?

1461
01:57:50,750 --> 01:57:53,917
To have the prince hanged.

1462
01:57:55,042 --> 01:58:01,083
Such a great betrayal!
Such betrayal!

1463
01:58:02,208 --> 01:58:08,083
Such a dangerous conspiracy
of a father killing a son?

1464
01:58:08,625 --> 01:58:09,708
Narpat!

1465
01:58:10,375 --> 01:58:12,125
Narpat Singh!

1466
01:58:14,917 --> 01:58:16,292
Narpat Singh!

1467
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,292
Narpat Singh!

1468
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:56,750
Prince..

1469
01:58:56,792 --> 01:58:59,208
The king will listen to the
truth and be very happy.

1470
01:58:59,292 --> 01:59:00,958
But where did you leave Bheemasaran?

1471
01:59:01,042 --> 01:59:03,375
Don't worry. How can he hurt us now?

1472
01:59:03,917 --> 01:59:07,042
And today, when the king hears
it that I am innocent..

1473
01:59:07,125 --> 01:59:08,792
I will show him my true form myself.

1474
01:59:09,042 --> 01:59:10,792
He is waiting to see that.

1475
01:59:11,042 --> 01:59:14,208
Your palace will be decorated
like a bride to welcome you.

1476
01:59:14,583 --> 01:59:17,875
Only Narpat must be in prison!

1477
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:19,958
He was challenging us.

1478
01:59:20,167 --> 01:59:22,625
You leave.. I will come into the
palace by the secret path.

1479
01:59:32,417 --> 01:59:34,417
Hail to the prince!

1480
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,208
Hail to the prince!

1481
01:59:36,292 --> 01:59:39,917
Hail to the prince!

1482
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Hail to the prince!

1483
01:59:52,458 --> 01:59:53,792
Welcome, prince.

1484
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:57,833
I am here to welcome you
as the king wishes so.

1485
02:00:05,667 --> 02:00:06,875
Hail to the king.

1486
02:00:08,917 --> 02:00:12,458
Your majesty, why are you standing?

1487
02:00:13,208 --> 02:00:15,250
Please sit on the throne.
Your majesty..

1488
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:18,917
As you wished so, I have
captured the killer prince.

1489
02:00:19,667 --> 02:00:24,292
And as you wished so, I have called
for the princess Sangita.

1490
02:00:24,958 --> 02:00:28,250
So that according to your promise..

1491
02:00:28,333 --> 02:00:30,958
She can avenge her father's death.

1492
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:34,542
Narpat Singh.

1493
02:00:36,125 --> 02:00:39,708
Don't forget that God has
the last justice.

1494
02:00:40,917 --> 02:00:44,375
And if the kings have meted
justice till today..

1495
02:00:45,167 --> 02:00:46,875
I am sure..

1496
02:00:47,792 --> 02:00:50,042
There will be justice this time too.

1497
02:00:50,375 --> 02:00:51,500
Surely.

1498
02:00:51,583 --> 02:00:56,083
Lowly one, wretch! I didn't
know you were so low!

1499
02:00:56,333 --> 02:00:57,917
Queen Kalavati.

1500
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:02,792
Your majesty, all this
has happened due to me.

1501
02:01:03,167 --> 02:01:05,792
I wouldn't dream of seeing
my son as a king.

1502
02:01:05,875 --> 02:01:07,333
And I wouldn't have
to see this day.

1503
02:01:07,417 --> 02:01:09,292
Your majesty, please
strangle me! Please!

1504
02:01:09,375 --> 02:01:14,000
Kill me! Kill me!

1505
02:01:16,167 --> 02:01:19,833
Your prince and your king's
life is in danger today.

1506
02:01:19,917 --> 02:01:23,208
If you don't fight
against him today..

1507
02:01:23,292 --> 02:01:26,250
He will ruin this whole country.

1508
02:01:26,333 --> 02:01:30,417
The women will be widowed. The
children will be orphaned.

1509
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:33,667
The women folk will have
their dignity in danger.

1510
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:39,167
- Can you people accept a traitor as your king?
- No!

1511
02:01:40,375 --> 02:01:42,667
The king is in danger.

1512
02:01:42,750 --> 02:01:46,042
Narpat uncle had tied the hands
of my father in my presence.

1513
02:01:46,125 --> 02:01:47,917
And he had dragged him away.

1514
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,500
Kill uncle Narpat. He
killed the chief.

1515
02:01:51,542 --> 02:01:53,333
Kill him!

1516
02:01:53,417 --> 02:01:57,542
Wait! Remember that Narpat's
men have weapons.

1517
02:01:57,625 --> 02:01:58,917
History is witness.

1518
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,500
Weapons cannot silence
the people's voice.

1519
02:02:02,583 --> 02:02:04,792
Our weapons are our unity.

1520
02:02:04,875 --> 02:02:06,208
Raise your batons!

1521
02:02:06,292 --> 02:02:11,333
Raise your hands! And kill
the traitors! Go ahead!

1522
02:02:11,417 --> 02:02:12,667
Hail to the king!

1523
02:02:12,750 --> 02:02:14,000
Hail to the king.

1524
02:02:15,625 --> 02:02:17,167
Civilians of Vijaynagar.

1525
02:02:17,708 --> 02:02:19,375
You must have seen and heard..

1526
02:02:19,458 --> 02:02:21,250
The justice of the
king many a times.

1527
02:02:21,583 --> 02:02:25,375
But the justice that
you will see today..

1528
02:02:25,458 --> 02:02:28,833
Even the gods of the sky
will praise our king.

1529
02:02:28,917 --> 02:02:31,542
I tremble to tell you..

1530
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:34,500
That the king has decided
to sentence..

1531
02:02:34,542 --> 02:02:36,333
His son to death for
the crime of murder.

1532
02:02:36,417 --> 02:02:37,500
No..

1533
02:02:37,833 --> 02:02:40,500
Your majesty, we aren't even
worthy of bowing to you.

1534
02:02:40,583 --> 02:02:43,542
We didn't think that a
man could rise so high.

1535
02:02:43,583 --> 02:02:45,750
Even though we don't wish to..

1536
02:02:45,833 --> 02:02:48,458
We will have to
accept your orders.

1537
02:02:49,375 --> 02:02:51,125
The king orders..

1538
02:02:51,208 --> 02:02:52,875
That the accused..

1539
02:02:52,958 --> 02:02:56,625
Who committed a murder and
escape from the law..

1540
02:02:56,708 --> 02:02:59,167
Will be killed in his
presence very soon.

1541
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:04,542
I am not a killer. I didn't
commit the murder.

1542
02:03:04,792 --> 02:03:07,917
And neither did I run away
from death like cowards.

1543
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:14,500
You know why I had run
away. Your majesty!

1544
02:03:15,792 --> 02:03:18,208
You are silent even when
you know the truth.

1545
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:23,417
Speak.. speak..

1546
02:03:24,458 --> 02:03:27,167
The king says that he doesn't
want to see your face.

1547
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:30,583
No, your majesty, please
don't say that.

1548
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,750
You know it very well that I don't..

1549
02:03:32,833 --> 02:03:35,583
Think that life and death
have any distance in between.

1550
02:03:36,375 --> 02:03:38,708
But I don't want to die
the death of a criminal.

1551
02:03:39,375 --> 02:03:42,667
Please say once that I am innocent.

1552
02:03:43,583 --> 02:03:45,023
That I haven't committed the murder.

1553
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:50,792
Kill me after that if you wish!
I won't say anything!

1554
02:03:50,875 --> 02:03:52,167
Narpat!

1555
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:53,250
Kill the murderer!

1556
02:03:53,292 --> 02:03:56,583
We will have to agree to
the orders of the king.

1557
02:03:56,958 --> 02:03:59,458
Please tell us if you
have any last wish.

1558
02:03:59,542 --> 02:04:01,750
My last wish?

1559
02:04:02,542 --> 02:04:03,982
My last wish is that all the books..

1560
02:04:04,042 --> 02:04:06,958
Should be burnt, in
which it is written..

1561
02:04:07,042 --> 02:04:11,833
That truth has never died
at the hands of lies.

1562
02:04:12,708 --> 02:04:15,958
This is my last request, Narpat.

1563
02:04:16,042 --> 02:04:18,125
Your last request will be fulfilled.

1564
02:04:18,208 --> 02:04:20,208
Kill the murderer!

1565
02:04:20,292 --> 02:04:22,083
Queen Sangita.

1566
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,375
Hail to the queen!

1567
02:04:32,458 --> 02:04:34,708
Hail to the queen!

1568
02:04:37,708 --> 02:04:39,958
Queen, you had nagged the king..

1569
02:04:40,042 --> 02:04:41,958
In the open court
that he wouldn't..

1570
02:04:42,042 --> 02:04:43,667
Be able to punish his own son.

1571
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:45,750
See it with your own eyes today.

1572
02:04:46,250 --> 02:04:48,042
The king orders you to kill him..

1573
02:04:48,125 --> 02:04:52,167
And fulfill the promise
he had given you.

1574
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:54,792
This is what I waited for..

1575
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:56,667
The prince..

1576
02:04:57,208 --> 02:04:59,750
No, princess!

1577
02:05:02,042 --> 02:05:04,958
Princess! He is not the killer.

1578
02:05:05,042 --> 02:05:09,042
Your orders are being fulfilled.
Hurry up, princess.

1579
02:05:12,167 --> 02:05:13,542
Wait.

1580
02:05:15,958 --> 02:05:17,309
Before you kill the prince, I wish..

1581
02:05:17,333 --> 02:05:22,333
To show you another face
of the prince's innocence.

1582
02:05:24,375 --> 02:05:27,792
Prince.. this servant is
sorry for this mistake.

1583
02:05:30,792 --> 02:05:31,875
Bhagat!

1584
02:05:43,292 --> 02:05:44,375
Bhagat!

1585
02:05:50,708 --> 02:05:54,292
Why did you stop, queen?
Fulfill your duty.

1586
02:05:55,833 --> 02:06:03,250
You are the prince? You killed
my father? No.. no!

1587
02:06:04,333 --> 02:06:07,667
Prince.. how did I hurt you?

1588
02:06:08,167 --> 02:06:12,250
You played with me like a toy,
and burnt me like a fire.

1589
02:06:12,917 --> 02:06:14,208
I thought..

1590
02:06:14,292 --> 02:06:18,125
That you were simple
and sincere. A God.

1591
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:22,833
And I couldn't even think
that a God could murder.

1592
02:06:23,875 --> 02:06:30,042
Why did you do all this? Answer me!

1593
02:06:30,417 --> 02:06:33,208
Queen, don't forget
your duty for love.

1594
02:06:33,292 --> 02:06:34,375
Yes, Sangita.

1595
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:38,542
When my own blood didn't heed
to the call of love and truth.

1596
02:06:39,333 --> 02:06:41,583
Then why are you forgetting
your duty for me?

1597
02:06:42,875 --> 02:06:45,000
Queen, look there.

1598
02:06:45,375 --> 02:06:48,667
If a father can sacrifice his
son in the temple of justice..

1599
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:51,125
Then why are you
ruining your duty?

1600
02:06:51,208 --> 02:06:54,000
Lift the bow, and fulfill your duty.

1601
02:06:55,458 --> 02:06:57,708
We want the chief's murderer dead.

1602
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:00,042
We want the chief's murderer dead.

1603
02:07:00,125 --> 02:07:02,500
We want the chief's murderer dead.

1604
02:07:02,583 --> 02:07:04,792
Forget that you are
a woman at this time.

1605
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,500
Fulfill the queen duty
like a tigress.

1606
02:07:07,542 --> 02:07:10,958
And cry on the dead body of
this murderer as a woman.

1607
02:07:11,042 --> 02:07:14,167
- Queen. Fulfill your promise..
- Yes!

1608
02:07:26,583 --> 02:07:28,167
Blood for blood!

1609
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:31,500
Blood for blood!

1610
02:07:33,833 --> 02:07:35,792
Revenge!

1611
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Kill Narpat uncle.. come with me..

1612
02:07:56,083 --> 02:07:57,500
Father!

1613
02:07:57,958 --> 02:07:59,833
Run away!

1614
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:09,083
Wait!

1615
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,500
Wait!

1616
02:08:12,792 --> 02:08:16,333
The prince didn't commit the murder.

1617
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:21,583
This Narpat is the killer.
This traitor Narpat.

1618
02:12:34,458 --> 02:12:39,792
Sangite.. your criminal.
Your father's killer.

1619
02:12:40,333 --> 02:12:41,958
Fulfill your promise.

1620
02:13:05,833 --> 02:13:08,042
Hail to the prince!

1621
02:13:08,125 --> 02:13:09,583
Hail to the prince!

1622
02:13:09,667 --> 02:13:11,542
Hail to the prince!

1623
02:13:11,583 --> 02:13:15,667
Hail to the prince!

1624
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:17,667
Hail to the prince!

1625
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:19,958
Hail to the prince!

1626
02:13:20,042 --> 02:13:23,875
Hail to the prince!

1627
02:13:23,958 --> 02:13:24,958
Father..

1628
02:13:25,042 --> 02:13:27,208
My son..

1629
02:13:27,292 --> 02:13:28,292
Father..

1630
02:13:28,333 --> 02:13:30,917
Please forgive me.. all this
happened because of me.

1631
02:13:31,250 --> 02:13:34,792
No, son. I should ask
for forgiveness.

1632
02:13:35,417 --> 02:13:38,583
I have done great injustice
to you, son.

1633
02:13:38,833 --> 02:13:42,125
May god give everyone
a son like you.

1634
02:13:42,208 --> 02:13:45,958
Son, in the presence of
the entire kingdom..

1635
02:13:46,292 --> 02:13:49,458
I will mark you my heir
with my own blood.

1636
02:13:49,708 --> 02:13:50,917
No..

1637
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:52,167
Not me..

1638
02:13:54,583 --> 02:13:55,833
Make Kumar the heir.

1639
02:13:55,917 --> 02:13:57,333
Please don't say that, son.

1640
02:13:57,417 --> 02:13:59,333
You are the rightful
owner of this throne.

1641
02:13:59,417 --> 02:14:01,500
I created problems in your paths..

1642
02:14:01,542 --> 02:14:06,125
To have him sit on the throne.
I have been punished for that.

1643
02:14:06,500 --> 02:14:07,833
Forgive me, son.

1644
02:14:07,917 --> 02:14:10,208
No.. please don't say that.

1645
02:14:10,875 --> 02:14:13,500
It doesn't seem good for a mother
to apologize to her son.

1646
02:14:14,083 --> 02:14:18,292
But I look good apologizing
to my daughter.

1647
02:14:18,958 --> 02:14:22,667
Come.. come here.. come..

1648
02:14:23,833 --> 02:14:26,500
I give you your criminal.

1649
02:14:32,333 --> 02:14:35,125
Father.. I have a request.

1650
02:14:35,833 --> 02:14:42,250
Nobody will rule here now.
The subjects will rule here now.

1651
02:14:42,333 --> 02:14:50,333
"Be careful here..
I am the prince here.."

1652
02:14:51,875 --> 02:14:59,875
"Back and forth it's my regime, for
I am the prince here. Trespassers.."
