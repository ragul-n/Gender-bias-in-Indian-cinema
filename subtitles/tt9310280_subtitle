4
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,821
Unless you're alone,

5
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,990
at such a great height,
looking down

6
00:00:57,136 --> 00:01:00,096
the cities growing like amoebas,

7
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:02,647
won't be visible at all.

8
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,574
But when did these cities
come into existence?

9
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,953
The day we ignored
Mahatma Gandhi's statement,

10
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,582
"The future of India
lies in its villages"

11
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,481
and instead deserted villages,

12
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:25,309
it marked the rise

13
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:26,912
of cities.

14
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:30,917
In 1991,
under the pretext of development,

15
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:33,611
a number of small villages
were desolated

16
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:38,457
to create exorbitant cities
all over the city.

17
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,975
Since then
they've been only growing.

18
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,035
But the small villages...

19
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:47,435
Where are they?

20
00:01:47,835 --> 00:01:50,168
No one knows.

21
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,090
The river

22
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:59,097
originated where the villages were

23
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:02,298
and ran to where
it turned into a sewer,

24
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:05,676
in the cities,
where it became stagnant.

25
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:08,467
Forever.

26
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:16,480
The cancerous side effects
of development

27
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:19,351
were overlooked back then.

28
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:21,678
But now,

29
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:26,794
they're being felt

30
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,472
in a brutal way.

32
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:26,702
Chanda, get the car!

33
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,688
Hey!

34
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:34,024
Hey!

35
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,224
Get hold of him!

36
00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:40,447
Get him!

37
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:42,128
Let go of me!

38
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,097
Go away!
- Let go of me!

39
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:46,117
Stop wiggling!

40
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,356
After he's dead, I'll protect you.

41
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,477
What if he doesn't?

42
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:51,997
Daya, why are you crying?

43
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,428
Are you scared?

44
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:57,001
At the moment, he's scared,
but all of you will feel the same!

45
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,948
He won't die! He's deadly!

46
00:05:59,197 --> 00:06:00,997
He won't spare any of you!
- Pull the trigger!

47
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,571
You son...

48
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,187
Drop the gun! Let's go!

49
00:06:08,755 --> 00:06:10,184
Stop!

50
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:13,322
Stop!

51
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:15,873
Catch him!

52
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:51,145
Catch him!

53
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:52,629
Catch him!

54
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:00,680
Come on!

55
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,491
I'm coming!

56
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,067
Oh God!

57
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:49,532
Please forgive me, sir.

58
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:51,306
Please forgive me.

59
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,859
What have you done?
- Forgive me.

60
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:56,996
Should I wipe it?

61
00:07:57,513 --> 00:07:58,783
Wipe?

62
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:01,689
You fool!

63
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:03,494
Aren't you the village chief?

64
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,030
Can't you open the gate properly?

65
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,618
Sir, please calm down.
He's old.

66
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,070
Get lost!

67
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:12,557
I'll deal with you!

68
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:14,510
Rahul! Rahul!

69
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:17,912
Rahul!

70
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,878
Rahul!

71
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:26,684
Rahul!

72
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:28,654
Rahul!

73
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:33,360
Rahul!

74
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:38,045
Hey fool!

75
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:40,252
Why are you still throwing stones?

76
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:42,567
Yesterday, he was throwing
stones at the board,

77
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:44,812
that's why the builder's
men thrashed Ganya.

78
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:48,413
Why don't you throw them
in the river?

79
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,393
I will do that.

80
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:53,965
Mom, just look!
- Rahul!

81
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:55,832
Rahul?

82
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:00,773
Shinde hit your father!

83
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:03,079
What?
- Hurry up!

84
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:04,549
Oh God!
- Mom?

85
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:27,591
Dad?

86
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:32,705
Why did you come here?
Go back!

87
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,635
Bend down!

88
00:09:34,962 --> 00:09:36,065
Make them bend as well.

89
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:38,750
Make them bend down.
- Even the old man!

90
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:40,492
He's ashamed of saluting us!

91
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:41,803
Of course, he will.

92
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,273
He is the village chief!
- Mr Village chief!

93
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:48,771
What is going on?

94
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,757
All of you, relax.

95
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:52,964
Up!

96
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:54,195
Sir,

97
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:57,627
he still feels that the
land belongs to him.

98
00:09:58,028 --> 00:09:59,329
Then who does it belong to?

99
00:09:59,585 --> 00:10:01,688
You rascal!

100
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:05,636
Go and ask your dad at home!

101
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,505
Get out!

102
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:09,276
Get out!

103
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:18,634
Chief, it suits you,

104
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:20,429
very well.

105
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:22,584
Ten years ago,

106
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:24,332
we stood like this

107
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:26,144
mocking somebody else.

108
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,480
We behaved in a similar manner!

109
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,792
In fact, worse than you!

110
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,527
Your end is near!

111
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:37,648
Your end is near!

112
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:42,757
I'll take your leave!
- Listen!

113
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:45,111
If I see any of you here again,

114
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,206
then I won't spare anyone of you!
Get out!

115
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:51,794
Stop staring! I won't spare you!

116
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:55,048
What more can you do now?

117
00:10:57,942 --> 00:10:59,140
Let's go.

118
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:01,143
Hold on.

119
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,732
Sir! Sir!

120
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:06,123
I'm the son of a farmer!

121
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:09,723
If you do something like that,

122
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:13,083
we'll do worse!

123
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:14,854
You rascal!

124
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:16,843
Bulls never come alone.

125
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:19,550
They come in pairs

126
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,878
along with the plough.

127
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,494
Let's go.

128
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,896
I'm the son of a farmer!
- Let's go!

129
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:35,557
Your days are numbered!

130
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:42,742
Shinde's men are useless people.

131
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,610
Things were going fine till now.

132
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,310
But he misbehaved with you, Chief.

133
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,194
It's not only you.

134
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:51,560
He has disrespected
the entire village.

135
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:54,950
He shouldn't have
raised his hand on you.

136
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:57,749
Chief! Chief!

137
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:01,158
Are you mocking at me?

138
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:04,289
Am I the chief?

139
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:09,628
I'm a watchman.

140
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,758
Every day, I salute
around 40 to 50 people.

141
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:19,383
Call me a watchman...

142
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,806
Rascal...

143
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:22,284
Useless...

144
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:25,239
But don't call me a chief!

145
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,734
Stop yelling.

146
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:31,753
You're the chief.

147
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,727
Not just a regular one.

148
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:39,461
You sold off the land
that belonged to your ancestors.

149
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:45,139
All of you over here

150
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:50,993
who sold their lands and forced
the young men to land tough jobs,

151
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:54,373
are all like the chief.

152
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:58,154
You sold the land.

153
00:12:59,322 --> 00:13:00,639
Blew it up on alcohol.

154
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:04,058
Got the daughters married.

155
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:05,791
Made a false display of wealth.

156
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:07,594
Which was the palace?

157
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,453
Jaipur Palace.

158
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,423
And now,

159
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:13,862
where's the money?

160
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,086
Where's the wealth?

161
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,789
Where's the son-in-law,
for whom you spent all the money?

162
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:23,047
Tell me!

163
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:28,900
The day there was no money left,
they threw her out of the house.

164
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:31,913
There's an SUV standing outside.

165
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:34,335
You can't afford diesel to run it.

166
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:36,256
Ms Chief uses it
to dry dung cakes.

167
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:43,639
This is our house.

168
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,468
He mortgaged the ancestral mansion
to get her married.

169
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:53,157
The builder, Shinde, called up.

170
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:57,034
We must vacate
the house by morning.

171
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:21,351
Are you thinking
of coming back, chief?

172
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:24,712
Take it off.

173
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,954
That's all you have left.

174
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:55,092
"Hey, Dhurpi!"

175
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:01,922
"What is it?"

176
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,191
"How can you leave the home,
your family has owned for ages?"

177
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:04,869
Hey, dumbo.

178
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:06,395
May I leave?

179
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:08,230
Get lost, you idiot!

180
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,312
Why are you throwing stones?
- Get lost!

181
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:11,851
What happened?

182
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,487
Wait!

183
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:32,611
Take that.

184
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,794
Appa.
- Next.

185
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,971
Put it down.

186
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:38,875
Get the next one.

187
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:41,523
Careful. They're onions.

188
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,581
Next one.

189
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:51,979
Appa!

190
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,543
What are you looking at?

191
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:55,879
Him.

192
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:58,701
I'm looking at that old man.

193
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:00,059
Which one?

194
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,163
Him.

195
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,909
That one?
He's been here about a month.

196
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:07,129
Did you just notice him?
- Do you recognise him?

197
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,502
No.

198
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,625
In 1980, he won
the "Maharashtra Kesari".

199
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:13,945
Him?

200
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:15,676
Yes. He's Sakha Patil.

201
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:17,194
Really?

202
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:19,259
How did he become a porter?

203
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,137
Sold his land.
Must've exhausted the money.

204
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:28,687
What a pity!

205
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:33,388
Once upon a time,
we grew plenty of foodgrains.

206
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:37,980
Now, we carry
the burden for others.

207
00:20:38,712 --> 00:20:40,053
Everything is gone.

208
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:43,555
Come on. Let's get back to work.

209
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,821
Your father is working hard
and you're digging into a corn.

210
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,173
Those who sold
their ancestral land

211
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,317
must do all the hard work.
- Shut up, useless!

212
00:20:58,704 --> 00:20:59,966
Help!

213
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:01,831
Help!

214
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:04,125
They'll kill me! Save me!

215
00:21:04,414 --> 00:21:05,652
Save me!

216
00:21:09,127 --> 00:21:11,286
How dare you!

217
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:14,852
Are you blind?
He's an old man!

218
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,459
He deserves to be bashed up!

219
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,460
Do you think I'm scared,
because you have weapons?

220
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:23,665
Hey! Don't threaten me!
- Get lost!

221
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:32,332
Such a mess!

222
00:21:46,562 --> 00:21:48,451
So far, I've only seen
people get beaten up.

223
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,114
It's the first time
I saw someone beating up.

224
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,576
Here.

225
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:05,406
It's special.

226
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:09,364
And it's free.

227
00:22:12,177 --> 00:22:13,201
From me.

228
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:21,581
One cutting for me.

229
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:38,504
What do you think?

230
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:42,397
What?
- I said, what do you think?

231
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:44,219
About the kettle?

232
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,460
No, the lady.

233
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:52,107
Both are hot!

234
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:54,750
Get lost, you idiot!

235
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:57,112
She's my daughter.
- Drunkard, why didn't you tell me?

236
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,170
Try calling your father that.

237
00:23:00,992 --> 00:23:03,239
A slight push wouldn't have hurt.

238
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:05,201
Would it?

239
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:08,227
Had he broken your limbs,
would you be left with any dignity?

240
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:13,739
Do we have any dignity left?

241
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:18,980
Mom...

242
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,673
You may sleep next to me.

243
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:25,277
You can lie down over there.

244
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:27,763
Rahul
- There's no more space.

245
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:31,237
Mr Village Chief!

246
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,906
Go to sleep.

247
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,728
Move.

248
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:56,525
I thought

249
00:23:57,647 --> 00:23:59,504
we'd be the only ones
from the village.

250
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,556
But the slum is full of people,
who have run away from villages.

251
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:09,196
The descendants of those, who sold
their land will have to do that.

252
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:12,104
Keep running!

253
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,273
Run!
- Run!

254
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,357
Run!
- Run!

255
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,859
Run!

256
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:21,400
Run!

257
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:09,649
Brother Uday!

258
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:11,836
Brother Uday!

259
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,839
Shout.

260
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,162
Only once.

261
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:44,349
Shout for the peace of my mind.

262
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:49,138
He's started sweating
while beating you up.

263
00:25:49,705 --> 00:25:52,358
When will you shout?
- He won't shout.

264
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:55,011
Even if you kill him,

265
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:57,291
he won't shout.

266
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:02,706
I've seen so many criminals so far.

267
00:26:05,086 --> 00:26:06,705
You're one of a kind.

268
00:26:10,624 --> 00:26:11,640
Shripad,

269
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:14,022
he'll cause us a lot of grief.

270
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,843
Hey there,

271
00:26:17,622 --> 00:26:18,622
in for a rape?

272
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,404
No, sir.
- Then?

273
00:26:22,462 --> 00:26:23,470
Uday,

274
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:25,043
not done.

275
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,021
Let him go.

276
00:26:30,152 --> 00:26:31,184
Where did you find him?

277
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:33,322
At the market yard.

278
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,919
Shop number 380.

279
00:26:38,002 --> 00:26:40,327
He has moved here
from Mulshi taluk six months ago.

280
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:41,865
He's a porter.

281
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:45,858
He works at Katke's shop.
- Wake up, Rahul.

282
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:47,916
Have you lost it?

283
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:52,763
A special one.

284
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,400
They at least sold the fenugreek
at the rate of two rupees.

285
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:04,426
The farmers think, we're
cheating them to fill our coffers.

286
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:06,826
Hey Ganya!
- Yes.

287
00:30:08,465 --> 00:30:09,735
Have as much as you want to.

288
00:30:10,318 --> 00:30:11,605
Why don't you have some?
- Have some.

289
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:12,692
Have a 'bhakri'.

290
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,114
Have it.

291
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:16,133
Why don't you start?
- I will.

292
00:30:17,507 --> 00:30:18,578
So, mister...

293
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,530
How much did you get
for the fenugreek?

294
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,856
I'm not asking for a share.
Just curious.

295
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,369
Show me the receipt.

296
00:30:29,568 --> 00:30:30,608
Show me the receipt.

297
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:35,488
Little one, which grade?
- Third.

298
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:49,016
Eight thousand.

299
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:52,133
How much fenugreek did you have?

300
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:55,140
A truck load of it, but

301
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,297
Fertilisers, pesticides, seeds...

302
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:02,396
How much did it cost you?

303
00:31:03,181 --> 00:31:04,269
About three thousand.

304
00:31:13,781 --> 00:31:14,861
Three thousand.

305
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,906
Was the truck hired, or your own?

306
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:21,956
Why are you poking fun at me?

307
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:23,855
The rent is two thousand.

308
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:25,920
Two thousand.

309
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:30,846
What about agents and police?

310
00:31:31,364 --> 00:31:33,983
About three hundred
for the police and toll booths.

311
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,032
That's only one way.

312
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:39,814
That's three hundred twice.

313
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,770
What about porters?

314
00:31:44,298 --> 00:31:46,377
Over a thousand.

315
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:50,588
So...

316
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,523
how much did your father lose?

317
00:31:56,222 --> 00:31:58,286
He lost the money
and was stripped naked.

318
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:07,769
Weep as much as you feel like.

319
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:10,766
You have to do that
for the rest of the year.

320
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,572
What is this?

321
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:24,782
You grow fenugreek.

322
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:27,387
But your family eats Gongora.

323
00:32:28,684 --> 00:32:30,200
Why do you do farming?

324
00:32:34,795 --> 00:32:36,986
We must grow
something on the farms.

325
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:38,297
Why?

326
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,075
Only to make others rich.

327
00:32:43,691 --> 00:32:44,810
We do all the hard work

328
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:47,217
and someone else
makes money out of it.

329
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:50,031
Go to hell!

330
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:53,239
I pick up vegetables
worth millions every day.

331
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:56,119
Don't you dare teach me!

332
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:59,592
You're a porter.
Stay in your limits.

333
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:01,499
Don't you dare
think like a businessman.

334
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:03,301
Get it?
- Why are you hitting me?

335
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,176
Don't you dare!
- Stop him!

336
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:08,656
I beg of you, inspector.

337
00:33:08,895 --> 00:33:10,395
He's beating him up.

338
00:33:10,548 --> 00:33:12,492
Babu Sheth trades in millions.

339
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:15,798
You want a good price
for fenugreek? Have it!

340
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:17,632
Have it!

341
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:21,740
If you don't do something,
we'll have to handle it our way.

342
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:25,060
I beg of you!
- He's a bully.

343
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:29,590
Lower your gaze or you had it!

344
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:30,910
Please spare him.

345
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:32,689
Why don't you ignore him?

346
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,051
Lower your gaze!

347
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:37,393
Lower it!

348
00:33:37,824 --> 00:33:40,379
Where's my weapon?

349
00:33:40,588 --> 00:33:43,191
Let me teach him a lesson.
Where is it?

350
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,686
That's how he was stabbed.

351
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:07,316
Good job.

352
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:13,258
The porter ripped open Shirke's
collar bone as if it a jackfruit.

353
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:17,453
A farmer's son is
provoked enough to kill a merchant.

354
00:34:18,662 --> 00:34:19,662
Why?

355
00:34:20,082 --> 00:34:21,082
Mr Pendse,

356
00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:23,603
you may ask that boy.

357
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,192
Excuse me.

358
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:30,996
Are you making it light for us,
or avoiding the questions?

359
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:33,103
Ask him that.

360
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,739
One moment

361
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:39,983
Are we getting any answers or not?
- Inspector More,

362
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,358
murders are rampant
in a city like Pune.

363
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,725
Organised crime is on the rise.

364
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:46,877
Why?

365
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,453
Mr Pendse,
you're a senior reporter.

366
00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:51,953
When cities grow,
this is inevitable.

367
00:35:08,198 --> 00:35:10,579
There's a new inspector
from Nagpur.

368
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:13,424
Is it a routine transfer
or suspension?

369
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,115
Good job. Get out.
- Sir.

370
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:16,642
Uday
- Sir.

371
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:19,123
Get rid of this girl right away,

372
00:35:19,392 --> 00:35:21,852
or I'll rip your collar bone out.
- What?

373
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:24,631
One moment.
- That's not fair.

374
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:26,309
Listen to me. Just a moment.

375
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:28,533
One moment.
Please listen to me.

376
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:31,162
Calm down!

377
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:34,523
I want to meet that boy.
- Go to the jail.

378
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,710
Go to the jail?

379
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,774
How did the police
become so active?

380
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,468
It's not about being active.

381
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:44,708
A police station is
like kindergarten for criminals.

382
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,060
Lock up is like the board exam.

383
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:51,573
It's the court's decision to allow
new admissions to the university.

384
00:35:51,878 --> 00:35:53,163
University?

385
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:55,236
University means jail.

386
00:35:56,024 --> 00:35:59,008
Entry to the jail
is important for new criminals.

387
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:02,830
Criminals of the highest order

388
00:36:03,651 --> 00:36:05,508
catch up with fresh talent here.

389
00:36:28,264 --> 00:36:30,612
Rascals!

390
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:34,884
I won't spare anyone!

391
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,462
Get out of here!

392
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:52,195
Come on! Move!

393
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:55,039
Stop staring, rascal!

394
00:36:59,022 --> 00:37:00,085
Shinde...

395
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,048
Everyone's scared of me.

396
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,700
Who is this one,
stuffing his mouth?

397
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:09,193
Another one
from the Mulshi pattern.

398
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:11,309
He'll be presented
at the court with you tomorrow.

399
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:12,653
Come on.

400
00:37:18,526 --> 00:37:21,248
Stop! You'll run over someone.

401
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:28,495
Everyone's here.
It's okay.

402
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:31,102
Surve, when did you get out?
- This morning. -Great!

403
00:37:31,253 --> 00:37:34,396
Smiley! He's my favourite.

404
00:37:35,092 --> 00:37:36,528
How many bullets, Jadhav?

405
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:39,346
Forty.
- He's going to set a record.

406
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:42,194
Mr Beard, how are you?

407
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,512
What about you?

408
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:45,349
The day after tomorrow.
- A call for you.

409
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:49,105
Mr Agarwal,
my men will speak with you.

410
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:50,909
Don't call me.

411
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:52,254
Rahul.

412
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,653
Shirke murder case.

413
00:37:55,312 --> 00:37:57,010
He is a porter like me.

414
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:00,562
Rahul, what is this?

415
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,569
I hope the police
didn't beat you up.

416
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:09,166
Did you see that, Mr Chief?

417
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:12,948
This is where the next generation
of land-sellers is headed.

418
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,199
We'll take care of everything.

419
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,020
We'll go back to our village.

420
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,895
These old men have sold off
the roads that led to the village.

421
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:30,412
Don't say that.
We'll set things right.

422
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:35,521
Very good, Mr Chief.

423
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:40,037
Ms Chief has started
washing and cleaning for others.

424
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:45,992
Have you got me a lawyer?

425
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:50,837
We went to many of them,
but they ask for a lot of money.

426
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,697
Kapil...
- Yes.

427
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:55,336
Get a lawyer
for this boy right away.

428
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:58,251
I want him on my team at any cost.

429
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:06,918
Hey, lawyer!

430
00:39:07,565 --> 00:39:08,866
Stop!

431
00:39:09,676 --> 00:39:11,017
Stop right there!

432
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:13,218
Stop right now!

433
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:20,034
Stop!
- Okay!

434
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:22,710
I was on my way to the crematorium.
- Keep going!

435
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:26,070
Come on, speed up!
- Yes.

436
00:39:26,312 --> 00:39:27,621
Speed up!
- I am!

437
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:31,028
I beg of you!
Speed up!

438
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:33,491
Faster!

439
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:38,656
Faster!

440
00:39:39,205 --> 00:39:40,451
Hey, Lawyer...

441
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:44,328
The day, you see
the fear of death on my face,

442
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:47,707
will be the last day of my life.

443
00:39:53,377 --> 00:39:55,607
Even if the God of Death arrives,

444
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:58,665
face him with style.

445
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:01,968
He should be scared to face us.

446
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,090
What say?

447
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:06,038
Knock him off.
- Don't knock him off.

448
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:08,286
Tear him apart!

449
00:40:17,886 --> 00:40:19,664
Give me the file.

450
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:22,967
Good!

451
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,116
Good example.

452
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,535
What was it?

453
00:40:26,864 --> 00:40:27,928
God of Death.

454
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,794
Tear him apart!

455
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:34,030
Anticipatory bail seems difficult.

456
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:37,637
They must serve
three months of jail time.

457
00:40:39,601 --> 00:40:41,657
Three months for a half murder?

458
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:43,057
Yes.

459
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,781
It may not be a big deal for you.

460
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,101
As per law, it's a serious crime.

461
00:40:49,682 --> 00:40:50,960
My boys can't be saved.

462
00:40:51,397 --> 00:40:52,413
Well...

463
00:40:53,392 --> 00:40:54,392
It's tough.

464
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,061
The CCTV footage
has captured it clearly.

465
00:40:58,007 --> 00:40:59,007
This one's clothes...

466
00:40:59,303 --> 00:41:00,311
That one's shoes...

467
00:41:00,574 --> 00:41:03,084
This one's number plate
and that one's weapons...

468
00:41:04,444 --> 00:41:08,161
And Mr Smiley blew
a flying kiss at the CCTV.

469
00:41:10,974 --> 00:41:14,429
He's wicked and stupid.

470
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,406
How do I get him out?

471
00:41:24,653 --> 00:41:25,709
Stop laughing.

472
00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:27,649
Lawyer...
- Yes.

473
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,238
Were the boys wrong?
- Not at all.

474
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:31,573
They followed my orders.
- I know.

475
00:41:32,147 --> 00:41:35,370
Why indulge in crime, if you
can't reveal who the criminal is?

476
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,722
Always remember
the three rules of our business.

477
00:41:46,428 --> 00:41:47,559
Number one.

478
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,665
If you commit a crime,
be open about it.

479
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:53,513
Being secretive is petty.
Hardened criminals don't do that.

480
00:41:54,363 --> 00:41:55,434
Number two.

481
00:41:55,794 --> 00:41:59,460
As soon as you commit a crime,
head right into the police station.

482
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:02,749
There's no place as safe
as the police station.

483
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:04,537
Number three.

484
00:42:04,793 --> 00:42:06,476
It's the most important one.

485
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:10,107
He's looking at Rahul.
- Mr Lawyer,

486
00:42:11,325 --> 00:42:12,690
when was this demon released?

487
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,264
I spent a whole day
to get him released.

488
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:18,886
Come here.
Yes, you. Come here.

489
00:42:19,763 --> 00:42:21,033
Make way.
- Come.

490
00:42:22,314 --> 00:42:24,488
He was gnawing
at the food like a wild beast.

491
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:28,128
It's okay.

492
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:29,449
Later.

493
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:34,143
Did you send non-vegetarian food
for the boys in jail? - Every day.

494
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:35,915
Pure non-veg from Surve's.

495
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,671
Really?

496
00:42:38,778 --> 00:42:41,731
You must eat non-vegetarian
to build a robust body.

497
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,131
We aren't the police,
to roam around with huge bellies!

498
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:50,165
Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, Bhojpuri...

499
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,166
All the film industries have
poked fun at your huge bellies.

500
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,704
When will you get in shape?

501
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:59,150
Double shifts leave us
with hardly any time.

502
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,668
You may resign.
Many young men are interested.

503
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:05,364
What is this?

504
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:07,429
And you.

505
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:11,645
The other day, a robber grabbed
a necklace right in front of you.

506
00:43:12,363 --> 00:43:13,375
Yes, sir.

507
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:15,969
It's not about the necklace.

508
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:20,640
The robber calmly walked off
while you were looking at him.

509
00:43:22,152 --> 00:43:23,867
You stood there staring at him.

510
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:27,650
Shripad...
- Sir.

511
00:43:28,247 --> 00:43:29,739
You better get them moving.

512
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,916
Give them protein of whatever.
I want results in a month.

513
00:43:33,036 --> 00:43:34,451
If not, you're out.

514
00:43:36,086 --> 00:43:37,951
If not for fitness sake,

515
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:41,383
start exercising
so that you can chase criminals.

516
00:44:00,342 --> 00:44:01,500
We got him.

517
00:44:03,304 --> 00:44:04,883
What is he saying?
- He won't give in.

518
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:06,426
What?

519
00:44:06,713 --> 00:44:09,356
I want the 7/12 extract
cleared within three days.

520
00:44:09,723 --> 00:44:12,450
If not, I'll clear you out.
- Yes, sir.

521
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,125
Brother...

522
00:44:19,835 --> 00:44:21,145
May I work on this matter?

523
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:23,458
You?

524
00:44:24,818 --> 00:44:25,881
Why not?

525
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:28,550
It's a heritage property.

526
00:44:29,912 --> 00:44:31,087
Twenty-one heirs.

527
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:34,430
Two in Ahmednagar,
two in Shirur.

528
00:44:35,313 --> 00:44:36,710
Three are in Phaltan.

529
00:44:37,729 --> 00:44:41,636
You need a good amount of muscle
to instil fear in people's minds.

530
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,599
You don't need muscles.
You need to guts.

531
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,479
Give me only one chance.

532
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:54,635
Shut up.

533
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,854
Govind
- Yes, sir.

534
00:45:01,134 --> 00:45:02,667
Don't work
on the 7/12 extract matter.

535
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:05,544
Let the macho man
from Mulshi handle it.

536
00:45:05,846 --> 00:45:06,878
Okay.

537
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:09,913
Thank you, brother.
- Get lost.

538
00:45:10,518 --> 00:45:12,510
Get it done.
- How many of you?

539
00:45:13,187 --> 00:45:14,615
Mr Lawyer...
- Yes, sir.

540
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:17,221
The land in Paud
- You're making a mistake.

541
00:45:18,374 --> 00:45:20,089
What?
- It's heritage property.

542
00:45:20,352 --> 00:45:21,686
There are 21 heirs.

543
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:23,235
It's a lot of work.

544
00:45:25,811 --> 00:45:27,184
This bull better stay in the shed.

545
00:45:28,004 --> 00:45:29,472
He commands no value in the market.

546
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:31,546
Mr Lawyer...

547
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:34,498
How many days
should I feed him for free?

548
00:45:35,312 --> 00:45:37,098
He must start working some day.

549
00:45:37,854 --> 00:45:39,140
We'll see how he does.

550
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,982
If he can deliver, he'll survive.

551
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:50,005
Otherwise, at the butcher's.

552
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,561
Mhadu Kachru Nikalje.

553
00:45:53,723 --> 00:45:56,447
Mhadu Kachru Nikalje. Present?
Where is he?

554
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:58,186
Dashrath Ganpat Kamble.

555
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:01,228
Dashrath Ganpat Kamble. Present?
- Yes.

556
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,952
Kanta Dhondiram Kamble. Present.
- Where is she?

557
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:06,591
Is that you? Okay.

558
00:46:06,686 --> 00:46:09,345
Manohar Dhondiram Kamble.

559
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,246
Number 21. Where is he?

560
00:46:12,613 --> 00:46:14,272
Manohar Dhondiram Kamble.

561
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:16,278
Where's Manohar Dhondiram Kamble?

562
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,833
He's my nephew.
- Where is he?

563
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:19,264
Please tell him.

564
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:22,289
He's at school.
- I told you not to send him there.

565
00:46:22,545 --> 00:46:24,545
The exams were on.
- Shut up! -.Don't.

566
00:46:25,556 --> 00:46:27,136
What a woman!

567
00:46:28,177 --> 00:46:29,455
Very nice. Raging bull.

568
00:46:31,532 --> 00:46:34,738
Manohar Kamble will be here
within two minutes.

569
00:46:35,346 --> 00:46:37,711
I've got to deal
with women, who're liars.

570
00:46:38,492 --> 00:46:41,421
Here comes Manohar Kamble!

571
00:46:41,629 --> 00:46:42,867
Manohar Kamble is here.

572
00:46:42,979 --> 00:46:46,360
Where was he? -We picked him up
from the examination hall.

573
00:46:46,483 --> 00:46:47,864
There he is!

574
00:46:48,415 --> 00:46:51,956
Next.
- Sachin Bhaurao Nikalje.

575
00:46:52,158 --> 00:46:54,658
Is he here?
- Next one.

576
00:46:55,144 --> 00:46:56,477
Keep moving.

577
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,361
Where are you going?
- I'm going with them.

578
00:46:59,585 --> 00:47:00,768
You carry on with your party.

579
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:02,976
Everyone, keep moving.

580
00:47:04,138 --> 00:47:06,892
Let's party!

581
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:10,579
Let's have some fun!

582
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:22,517
Let go.

583
00:47:23,554 --> 00:47:25,134
So, what do you think of the bull?

584
00:47:26,216 --> 00:47:27,739
Doesn't he deliver?

585
00:47:29,227 --> 00:47:31,282
But this raging bull

586
00:47:31,863 --> 00:47:33,823
scared the wits out of people.
- Meaning?

587
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:38,687
Dhondiram Kamble's son
was in school, taking exams.

588
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:41,275
I threatened the teacher
and picked him up from there.

589
00:47:41,636 --> 00:47:45,599
Rahul punished his uncle
by stripping him naked.

590
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:49,913
The uncle kept pleading
to spare him and have mercy.

591
00:47:49,962 --> 00:47:52,732
Get lost! Get out of here!

592
00:47:53,608 --> 00:47:54,645
Out!

593
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:57,581
He needs to be tamed,
or he'll bite.

594
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:00,819
He's our younger brother's
father-in-law.

595
00:48:02,442 --> 00:48:03,854
You want me to get lost?

596
00:48:04,887 --> 00:48:05,919
Do you?

597
00:48:09,862 --> 00:48:13,695
Shirpya Damu Shedge.
Village, Malegaon. Taluka, Mulshi.

598
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:17,511
You're still alive.

599
00:48:21,112 --> 00:48:23,286
Nanya Vitthal Tarde.

600
00:48:24,562 --> 00:48:27,499
I'm alive to have the food that
they'll serve after you're dead.

601
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:31,337
What is this?

602
00:48:31,893 --> 00:48:33,480
A 7/12 extract?
- Yes.

603
00:48:34,914 --> 00:48:36,509
The boys cleared it today.

604
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:38,759
Tell me,

605
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:41,824
have you spared farmers
any land in the taluka?

606
00:48:43,436 --> 00:48:47,486
The land remains, because a few
like you, still continue farming.

607
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:53,612
That's why you set
your dogs free to scare us away.

608
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:55,249
Yes.

609
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:00,326
Shirpya...

610
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,568
So far, I've taken away your lands.

611
00:49:06,509 --> 00:49:07,755
Next, it'll be your life.

612
00:49:13,065 --> 00:49:17,169
You took away our lives,
when you took our land.

613
00:49:17,444 --> 00:49:21,171
What you see now is only a body.

614
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:25,837
The bottle fell down.

615
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:27,928
The bottle.

616
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:31,043
All you goons

617
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,908
will live

618
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:35,802
with fear all your lives

619
00:49:36,278 --> 00:49:38,574
that someone
may kill you any moment.

620
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:40,328
You'll survive today.

621
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,734
And tomorrow too.

622
00:49:42,342 --> 00:49:43,907
But it'll be game over
on the day after.

623
00:49:44,557 --> 00:49:45,729
Boom!

624
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,114
And then

625
00:49:50,883 --> 00:49:53,455
Hey, kill me. Come on.

626
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:55,568
Kill you?
- Yes.

627
00:49:58,812 --> 00:50:01,351
You don't deserve
to be killed by me.

628
00:50:01,677 --> 00:50:02,685
Get it?

629
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,417
I charge fifty million for a murder.

630
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,722
He has nothing to do.

631
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,509
Everyone, get back to work.
- Move out.

632
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:12,030
Hey!

633
00:50:12,307 --> 00:50:14,556
You, come here.

634
00:50:15,574 --> 00:50:17,089
Come here.

635
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,100
You stripped that man naked.

636
00:50:24,174 --> 00:50:25,192
Was it fun?

637
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:30,385
Fifteen years ago,
Nanya did that to your father too.

638
00:50:31,976 --> 00:50:33,095
I thought

639
00:50:34,804 --> 00:50:36,455
you'd be the winning horse.

640
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:40,325
But you're a street dog.
Get lost.

641
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,543
Get out of here.

642
00:50:44,824 --> 00:50:46,292
Bloody agent.

643
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,699
Staring at me.

644
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:50,734
I bet on Rahul.

645
00:50:51,172 --> 00:50:52,847
He's the winning horse.

646
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,285
I'll bet a twenty.

647
00:50:56,113 --> 00:50:57,381
I bet on Nanya.

648
00:50:57,798 --> 00:50:58,988
Winning horse!

649
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,457
I bet fifty on Ganya.

650
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,058
Ganya?

651
00:51:06,823 --> 00:51:07,862
Five hundred.

652
00:51:12,078 --> 00:51:13,079
For whom?

653
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:15,588
For me!

654
00:51:17,346 --> 00:51:19,084
Why did you spend so much for me?

655
00:51:21,631 --> 00:51:23,631
I met you on your last birthday.

656
00:51:24,886 --> 00:51:26,283
It's been a year since then.

657
00:51:27,993 --> 00:51:30,565
You cleared forty 7/12 extracts.

658
00:51:32,434 --> 00:51:34,664
Even I wasn't that quick.

659
00:51:37,584 --> 00:51:39,839
I only need your blessings.

660
00:51:40,974 --> 00:51:44,070
I'm only a shadow of you.
- Shadow!

661
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:47,125
But...

662
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:49,775
A shadow?

663
00:51:51,214 --> 00:51:52,968
You're my brother.

664
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:55,440
You're my life.

665
00:51:56,198 --> 00:51:57,824
A shadow falls under the feet.

666
00:51:58,239 --> 00:51:59,906
A brother must be hugged tight.

667
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:01,391
Come on!

668
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,612
Mr Lawyer...
- Yes, sir.

669
00:52:07,479 --> 00:52:11,229
This raging bull
will be my successor.

670
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:12,715
Take it from me.

671
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,948
He said it.

672
00:52:17,586 --> 00:52:19,467
And I earned his position.

673
00:52:22,091 --> 00:52:24,496
To hell with your law.

674
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,451
Get up

675
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:30,239
and set my boys free.

676
00:52:31,172 --> 00:52:32,701
Okay, sir.

677
00:52:33,896 --> 00:52:34,991
Tomorrow by 11.00

678
00:52:38,226 --> 00:52:39,963
Do you remember this watch?

679
00:52:41,299 --> 00:52:42,322
Of course!

680
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:50,486
Your time begins from now on.

681
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,558
Right, Mr Lawyer?
- Yes, sir.

682
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:54,376
Brother, the preparations are done.

683
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:57,394
What are you all waiting for?
Let's go.

684
00:52:57,555 --> 00:52:59,285
Come on.
- A gift for you.

685
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:01,985
What is this?

686
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:04,583
It's time to celebrate!

687
00:53:06,844 --> 00:53:09,249
Deadly!

688
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:22,018
Shinde

689
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:27,100
he took my parents' fingerprints
on your papers, didn't he?

690
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:29,229
On the 7/12 extract?

691
00:58:31,734 --> 00:58:33,583
You took over our land.

692
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:37,064
We're bound to take revenge.

693
00:58:50,009 --> 00:58:51,247
Mr Lawyer,

694
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,258
I should be out
within three months.

695
00:58:56,604 --> 00:59:00,540
Or your family won't find a lawyer
to fight your murder case. - Yes.

696
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,846
Here I am!
- Here comes the saviour.

697
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:59,286
He bails out criminals
as if he was born to serve them.

698
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:01,861
I must do that to earn a living.

699
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:08,141
Uday, here's the bail application.
Let the boys go.

700
01:00:09,127 --> 01:00:11,709
Hey, why are you
sitting down like criminals?

701
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:13,059
Stand up.

702
01:00:14,148 --> 01:00:15,181
Nice.

703
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:18,412
Take care of our children.

704
01:00:21,093 --> 01:00:22,402
Children!

705
01:00:24,944 --> 01:00:26,023
Nanya is no more.

706
01:00:28,272 --> 01:00:29,701
Who will you serve now?

707
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:33,459
I will serve the one,
who holds the power.

708
01:00:34,938 --> 01:00:36,876
All these years it was Nanya.
Now it'll be Rahul.

709
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,363
Why are you laughing?

710
01:00:39,506 --> 01:00:40,514
Hey, police!

711
01:00:41,176 --> 01:00:43,661
You're not allowed to touch.
Don't touch them.

712
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:48,318
You don't have the permission.

713
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:50,901
Uday...
- Sir.

714
01:00:51,776 --> 01:00:53,657
Instead of killing these
boys in an encounter,

715
01:00:53,782 --> 01:00:55,822
we'd rather
strip him naked and bash him up.

716
01:01:01,267 --> 01:01:02,347
Naked!

717
01:01:03,257 --> 01:01:04,302
Really?

718
01:01:08,435 --> 01:01:09,436
Well, Inspector Kadu...

719
01:01:12,305 --> 01:01:14,845
Face me from
the witness box at the court.

720
01:01:18,493 --> 01:01:21,152
You'll learn the art of encounter
without stripping anyone naked.

721
01:01:23,468 --> 01:01:25,547
The word "encounter"
doesn't exist in books of law.

722
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,702
It's a pretence
put up by police officers.

723
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,549
Come on, boys.

724
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:36,876
No one can trouble you now.

725
01:01:38,864 --> 01:01:40,460
No matter how much they want to.

726
01:01:53,784 --> 01:01:54,799
And sir

727
01:01:58,842 --> 01:02:00,493
the toy on your table...

728
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:05,203
Do you remember, when you
last fired a bullet from it?

729
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:10,711
You won't remember.
So sad!

730
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:17,757
Getting hold of criminals
is your job, not punishing them.

731
01:02:17,948 --> 01:02:20,591
We'll decide,
whether they're criminals or not.

732
01:02:24,582 --> 01:02:25,694
That's what we're worth.

733
01:02:28,389 --> 01:02:31,359
He got a bail application
and left us helpless.

734
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:34,599
A toy!

735
01:02:35,784 --> 01:02:37,966
He called
our service revolver a toy.

736
01:02:39,553 --> 01:02:40,554
Sir...

737
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:43,309
Law renders us helpless.
Why don't we ignore it?

738
01:02:43,475 --> 01:02:44,484
Why?

739
01:02:45,573 --> 01:02:48,193
Instead, we'll turn them
against each other and finish them.

740
01:02:48,448 --> 01:02:51,122
We'll only prepare
a report of the events.

741
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,788
Do you mean, we get
the criminals to kill each other?

742
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:58,528
They not only kill each other,

743
01:02:59,603 --> 01:03:01,445
they must be running
after each others' lives.

744
01:03:02,591 --> 01:03:03,782
Our only job would be

745
01:03:04,601 --> 01:03:07,681
to make sure they don't
stop chasing each other.

746
01:03:18,276 --> 01:03:19,634
Speed up!

747
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:30,005
Sir, why are we here,
instead of saving his life?

748
01:03:31,136 --> 01:03:32,149
Duty.

749
01:03:32,296 --> 01:03:33,471
Sir duty...
- Tell me...

750
01:03:34,928 --> 01:03:39,152
Does he know,
what exactly happened last night?

751
01:03:41,297 --> 01:03:44,499
If he found out, Rahul will
turn around and run towards them.

752
01:03:45,017 --> 01:03:49,129
He'll take their lives.
- He'll do that if he's spared.

753
01:03:50,673 --> 01:03:53,842
Do you really think,
the demon will die so easily?

754
01:03:54,924 --> 01:03:56,368
We aren't that lucky.

755
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,366
There comes your village mate.

756
01:04:03,981 --> 01:04:05,220
He won't die so soon.

757
01:04:14,937 --> 01:04:15,964
Oh!

758
01:04:16,616 --> 01:04:18,394
Where did he find
the emissary of justice?

759
01:04:25,982 --> 01:04:27,054
Give me your phone.

760
01:04:41,222 --> 01:04:45,135
His gang members have turned
against him. Who is he calling up?

761
01:04:48,268 --> 01:04:50,300
India is my country.

762
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:53,135
All Indians
are my brothers and sisters.

763
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,019
I love my country.
- Hello.

764
01:04:56,346 --> 01:04:57,521
Hello, Manya...

765
01:04:59,986 --> 01:05:02,550
I'm proud of
it's rich and varied heritage.

766
01:05:02,764 --> 01:05:07,335
I shall always
strive to be worthy of it.

767
01:05:07,438 --> 01:05:09,700
I shall always live up to it.

768
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:15,689
I shall respect my parents,
teachers and elders.

769
01:05:15,836 --> 01:05:18,804
I will always
be polite to everyone.

770
01:05:18,905 --> 01:05:24,162
To my country and my people,

771
01:05:24,426 --> 01:05:27,370
I pledge my devotion.
In their well-being

772
01:05:27,628 --> 01:05:32,122
and prosperity alone,
lies my happiness.

773
01:05:32,402 --> 01:05:33,601
Glory to India.

774
01:05:35,834 --> 01:05:37,263
Make it quick.

775
01:05:40,109 --> 01:05:42,666
Sakhya, your son has been released.

776
01:05:43,207 --> 01:05:44,263
They say, he'll come here.

777
01:05:45,218 --> 01:05:48,164
Is he coming here
to share our burden?

778
01:05:49,294 --> 01:05:52,018
Exactly at six.

779
01:05:52,861 --> 01:05:54,996
You must report every day at 6.00.
Sign it.

780
01:05:55,723 --> 01:05:59,359
Attitude!
Stop throwing it at me.

781
01:05:59,647 --> 01:06:01,377
You're out on bail, not acquitted.

782
01:06:01,751 --> 01:06:02,782
Get it?

783
01:06:03,253 --> 01:06:05,666
If you...
- Bail is as good as acquittal.

784
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:07,971
Come on, Ganya.

785
01:06:08,925 --> 01:06:11,211
You earned sympathies
by killing Shirke

786
01:06:12,627 --> 01:06:14,556
and spread fear
by killing Nanya.

787
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:17,712
Now...

788
01:06:18,396 --> 01:06:19,412
What's next?

789
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,376
I'm not in the habit
of thinking about future.

790
01:06:26,994 --> 01:06:30,455
Then you must break the habit.
- Hey!

791
01:06:31,004 --> 01:06:32,021
Careful.

792
01:06:32,425 --> 01:06:34,195
You'll disturb the crease.
- That's

793
01:06:35,046 --> 01:06:36,258
the habit that must change.

794
01:06:39,655 --> 01:06:41,163
It may take some time

795
01:06:41,459 --> 01:06:43,157
but you better make the change.

796
01:06:43,516 --> 01:06:44,826
I don't have the time.

797
01:06:46,131 --> 01:06:48,925
I want to rule
every corner of the city.

798
01:06:54,305 --> 01:06:56,498
Your highness, come on.

799
01:06:58,294 --> 01:07:01,452
How far does
your kingdom of crime extend?

800
01:07:02,536 --> 01:07:04,584
You killed someone,
to take over the rule.

801
01:07:04,982 --> 01:07:09,770
Someone may kill you
and establish his rule.

802
01:07:14,246 --> 01:07:16,572
I'll put an end
to all such possibilities.

803
01:07:18,155 --> 01:07:19,181
In each

804
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,563
corner

805
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,930
I'll be the only one
to last forever.

806
01:07:28,523 --> 01:07:30,658
Only plastic lasts forever.

807
01:07:31,574 --> 01:07:33,550
Then, I'm plastic.

808
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:37,682
There's a system, responsible
for making plastic like me.

809
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,073
Why don't you taunt the system?

810
01:07:42,175 --> 01:07:43,239
Plastic.

811
01:07:45,776 --> 01:07:48,458
If you're so angry
about the system being wrong,

812
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:52,842
why didn't you take up
IAS or IPS to change it?

813
01:07:53,989 --> 01:07:55,838
Why didn't you?

814
01:07:59,026 --> 01:08:00,709
What did you do
by turning to crime?

815
01:08:02,509 --> 01:08:05,850
A collector needs five signatures
to fill up a pit on the road.

816
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:11,866
You need ten of them to arrest me.

817
01:08:14,027 --> 01:08:17,210
How many signatures would
I need to change the system?

818
01:08:23,503 --> 01:08:24,527
May I leave?

819
01:08:27,721 --> 01:08:28,848
See you soon.

820
01:08:29,527 --> 01:08:30,884
That's what you say.

821
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:34,529
Because,

822
01:08:35,627 --> 01:08:37,167
you've got to report every day.

823
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,144
I'll see you tomorrow.

824
01:08:42,252 --> 01:08:43,823
Inspector Kadu,
your words are sweet.

825
01:08:45,867 --> 01:08:46,948
Where do you belong to?

826
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,427
I belong to the place
where I am posted at.

827
01:08:53,535 --> 01:08:56,257
I like peace
in the place I belong to.

828
01:08:57,915 --> 01:08:58,922
Go.

829
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:01,139
Get going.

830
01:09:28,334 --> 01:09:29,810
He's back!

831
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:33,036
There he is!

832
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:03,359
You don't have to work
as a porter from now on.

833
01:10:05,443 --> 01:10:07,174
The entire market is ours.

834
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:10,439
It's yours.

835
01:10:12,555 --> 01:10:13,705
But the burden is mine.

836
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:17,413
I earned it by
selling off my ancestral land.

837
01:10:19,219 --> 01:10:21,020
I'll flaunt it
on my back until I'm dead.

838
01:10:24,097 --> 01:10:25,303
It's like a jewel to me.

839
01:10:29,382 --> 01:10:30,382
Father...

840
01:10:31,782 --> 01:10:34,678
The city will now follow my orders.

841
01:10:35,585 --> 01:10:36,601
Okay?

842
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:39,521
I'll relieve everyone
of their burden.

843
01:10:40,161 --> 01:10:41,383
And burden the mind instead.

844
01:10:44,436 --> 01:10:45,572
Go back, son.

845
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:47,271
Go back to your world.

846
01:10:48,765 --> 01:10:49,773
Live your own life

847
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:52,109
and let me live mine.

848
01:10:52,928 --> 01:10:56,343
Okay? Now, go on.

849
01:11:06,784 --> 01:11:07,974
Hey, son...

850
01:11:11,259 --> 01:11:12,648
I like your clothes.

851
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:15,435
But avoid pure whites.

852
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:19,160
Even a tiny speck on it
will be easily noticed by all.

853
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:22,222
Go on.

854
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:23,840
Take care of yourself.

855
01:11:34,815 --> 01:11:35,835
Shirpya...

856
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,163
I shouldn't have taken up farming.

857
01:11:40,069 --> 01:11:41,728
Look at what I've reaped

858
01:11:43,151 --> 01:11:44,278
after what I sowed.

859
01:11:46,296 --> 01:11:47,788
Our area is cursed.

860
01:11:49,123 --> 01:11:50,662
If we sow grafted mango saplings,

861
01:11:51,881 --> 01:11:53,211
they're attacked by parasites.

862
01:11:54,725 --> 01:11:56,598
Only one mistake
ruined our children's lives.

863
01:11:56,653 --> 01:11:58,249
Help me pick it up.

864
01:12:13,363 --> 01:12:16,085
When this porter sat at
the village hall with a turban,

865
01:12:19,965 --> 01:12:21,648
he'd appear greater than the skies.

866
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:34,171
Today, he seems so distant.

867
01:13:28,793 --> 01:13:31,341
Rahul, Pitya is robbing
cars on the mountain road.

868
01:13:33,533 --> 01:13:34,605
Pitya,

869
01:13:35,765 --> 01:13:36,797
we have a target.

870
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:39,466
Hang up. Got to get back to work.

871
01:13:40,184 --> 01:13:42,827
Surve, stop the car.
- Move aside.

872
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:45,488
Park your car on the side.

873
01:13:47,811 --> 01:13:48,811
I'll be right back.

874
01:13:49,544 --> 01:13:52,512
Welcome. This is Pitya.
- Come here.

875
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:54,563
Where are you going?

876
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:56,825
To enjoy nature
or buy a piece of it?

877
01:13:57,161 --> 01:14:01,590
I saw a 1.5-acre plot
near Lavasa on the hill-top.

878
01:14:01,831 --> 01:14:03,005
I'm going to buy it.

879
01:14:03,724 --> 01:14:06,161
Who's the agent?
- The party is from Mumbai.

880
01:14:06,638 --> 01:14:08,860
What about you?
- I'm from Pune.

881
01:14:09,554 --> 01:14:12,442
He's from Mumbai,
you're from Pune, the land is ours.

882
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:16,576
Why?
- Because, I simply love nature.

883
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,848
You rarely get
enough oxygen in the city.

884
01:14:18,906 --> 01:14:20,342
So now, you want our oxygen too.

885
01:14:21,379 --> 01:14:23,817
Why are you laughing?

886
01:14:28,225 --> 01:14:31,161
Are you here to collect
contribution for something?

887
01:14:31,459 --> 01:14:34,768
Stop joking.
We're not here for contribution.

888
01:14:35,663 --> 01:14:37,337
We're here for extortion.
- What?

889
01:14:37,552 --> 01:14:38,564
I mean...

890
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:42,395
Your name will appear
on the 7/12 extract. Right?

891
01:14:42,548 --> 01:14:44,207
You'll be a villager.

892
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:47,371
We want you to unveil this board.
- Really?

893
01:14:47,993 --> 01:14:49,930
Be careful.

894
01:14:50,344 --> 01:14:51,352
Pull the string.

895
01:14:51,648 --> 01:14:53,314
One, two, three.

896
01:14:53,638 --> 01:14:56,538
"The land dealings in the area
will be solely handled by farmers."

897
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:00,990
Read it.

898
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,794
What nonsense is that?

899
01:15:04,177 --> 01:15:06,296
Do you think you can buy our land?

900
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,930
Just because you have money,
you're here to buy it.

901
01:15:09,598 --> 01:15:11,634
There's no more land available.

902
01:15:11,987 --> 01:15:14,677
We'll take over the remaining ones.

903
01:15:15,602 --> 01:15:18,403
If I see you again on this road,

904
01:15:19,106 --> 01:15:21,924
the others will
have to go back without you.

905
01:15:22,076 --> 01:15:23,769
Got it?

906
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:27,986
Don't give this one
a lot of bird seed.

907
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:29,374
His apetite is growing.

908
01:15:30,496 --> 01:15:31,576
Jalinder...

909
01:15:34,812 --> 01:15:37,288
Did you let
the red one out for some time?

910
01:15:37,556 --> 01:15:38,683
Yes, I did.

911
01:15:38,818 --> 01:15:41,564
Then, what's wrong with him?
- Rahul that area is ours.

912
01:15:41,915 --> 01:15:45,248
You're taking it very lightly.
If we ignore, no one will fear us.

913
01:15:45,839 --> 01:15:47,831
The area is theirs too.

914
01:15:49,034 --> 01:15:52,264
There are a lot of ways of earning.
We need no go scavenging.

915
01:15:53,355 --> 01:15:55,267
Are you thinking about
becoming a porter again?

916
01:16:00,843 --> 01:16:02,057
We will pick up load,

917
01:16:03,249 --> 01:16:04,400
but we'll use our brains.

918
01:16:05,632 --> 01:16:07,227
We won't take
the burden on our backs.

919
01:16:07,952 --> 01:16:09,611
It's time to use our brains.

920
01:16:10,741 --> 01:16:13,035
I'll show you
the standard market yard.

921
01:16:13,632 --> 01:16:14,648
Take this.

922
01:16:16,453 --> 01:16:17,508
This is it.

923
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,427
Standard Market Yard.

924
01:16:23,945 --> 01:16:27,127
The wasteland
that our parents sold off

925
01:16:28,449 --> 01:16:30,600
was used to make this gold mine.

926
01:16:32,224 --> 01:16:34,169
It's called an IT Park.

927
01:16:35,323 --> 01:16:36,490
What do you want?

928
01:16:37,253 --> 01:16:38,293
Scrap.

929
01:16:38,819 --> 01:16:39,842
Scrap?

930
01:16:44,674 --> 01:16:47,698
Who will be given the scrap,

931
01:16:48,716 --> 01:16:50,157
is the decision
of our superiors.

932
01:16:51,956 --> 01:16:53,209
Right?

933
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:54,958
Our boss.

934
01:16:56,137 --> 01:16:57,684
We have it all sorted.

935
01:16:58,178 --> 01:16:59,186
You may leave.

936
01:17:05,195 --> 01:17:07,314
Is that why your nephew
picks up all the scrap?

937
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:13,537
I've picked him up
in the afternoon.

938
01:17:15,747 --> 01:17:17,580
Is the scrap more precious
or your nephew?

939
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:19,899
It's up to you.

940
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:25,571
At least now you can sit properly.

941
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,158
Well, I was saying
- We'll collect the scrap at 6.00.

942
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:33,677
Every day, at 6.00.
- Excuse me.

943
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:35,226
Please...

944
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:39,890
Mr Uday,

945
01:17:40,638 --> 01:17:42,516
may I appoint someone
to sign on my behalf?

946
01:17:42,671 --> 01:17:44,195
It's boring
to come here all the way.

947
01:17:44,586 --> 01:17:46,181
I'll come on his behalf.
- You?

948
01:17:46,649 --> 01:17:48,919
Will you pull through another week?
- Make way.

949
01:17:49,677 --> 01:17:50,748
Uday...

950
01:17:51,314 --> 01:17:52,949
Stop taking signatures from him.

951
01:17:53,723 --> 01:17:55,981
The boss needs to give
attendance, not his subordinates.

952
01:17:56,393 --> 01:17:58,925
Rahul is the boss. Did he report?
- Yes.

953
01:17:59,602 --> 01:18:00,673
Get up!

954
01:18:00,985 --> 01:18:03,683
Get out of here.
- You're saying we're incompetent.

955
01:18:05,685 --> 01:18:06,717
Sit down.

956
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,396
Incompetent.

957
01:18:12,955 --> 01:18:14,293
Your foot touched me by mistake.

958
01:18:15,093 --> 01:18:16,355
I did it deliberately.

959
01:18:17,494 --> 01:18:18,615
Okay.

960
01:18:20,314 --> 01:18:21,354
What did you say?

961
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:24,366
Incompetent.

962
01:18:27,886 --> 01:18:29,148
Are you competent?

963
01:18:32,247 --> 01:18:35,113
You hit someone for
a contribution of twenty-one bucks?

964
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,336
Oh no.

965
01:18:36,903 --> 01:18:38,357
When it's contribution,
money is secondary.

966
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:39,762
Prestige is more important.

967
01:18:40,224 --> 01:18:42,146
You're fighting
for twenty-one bucks.

968
01:18:42,281 --> 01:18:44,971
Rahul has a scrap contract
worth 2.1 million.

969
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:51,076
Your land is house
to two MIDC areas and an IT park.

970
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:53,085
But only Rahul used his brain.

971
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,246
That's what I call
being futuristic.

972
01:18:56,011 --> 01:18:57,709
Get lost.
Throw them out of here.

973
01:18:58,102 --> 01:18:59,904
Get lost.
- Get going.

974
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:04,171
Sir, I'll show you
how to gather scrap.

975
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,807
Let's go.

976
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:08,571
Don't let any of Rahul's trucks
move out with the scrap.

977
01:19:09,424 --> 01:19:11,671
He'll learn his lesson.

978
01:19:18,318 --> 01:19:20,460
Now, it's time
to count dead bodies.

979
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,691
Why did you set the cars on fire?

980
01:23:37,898 --> 01:23:40,462
Tell me! -.Please, dad!
- Uday!

981
01:23:40,806 --> 01:23:42,084
He's your son, isn't he?

982
01:23:43,761 --> 01:23:45,574
Why are you beating him
as if he's a criminal?

983
01:23:49,015 --> 01:23:50,031
Take a look.

984
01:23:51,034 --> 01:23:54,232
He has photos of those,
we beat up for misbehaviour.

985
01:23:54,527 --> 01:23:56,067
He set cars on fire in Dhankavdi.

986
01:23:59,111 --> 01:24:00,126
Jadhav...

987
01:24:00,565 --> 01:24:03,040
Yes, sir. -It's the day
of your daughter's surgery.

988
01:24:03,378 --> 01:24:05,299
Right, sir.
- Then?

989
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:08,396
It's postponed, because
I don't have half a million.

990
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:15,563
Shinde...

991
01:24:15,969 --> 01:24:16,985
Yes, sir.

992
01:24:19,369 --> 01:24:20,853
Call Pitya.

993
01:24:24,589 --> 01:24:26,597
Tell him,
there's an order for his encounter.

994
01:24:31,463 --> 01:24:32,582
Everyone, stay here.

995
01:24:34,802 --> 01:24:36,223
Pitya!
- Where's Inspector Kadu.

996
01:24:36,811 --> 01:24:39,065
What have I done, sir?
- Pitya, it's you!

997
01:24:39,511 --> 01:24:41,234
No extortion, no murders.

998
01:24:41,394 --> 01:24:44,461
I haven't even slapped anyone.
- I have orders from superiors.

999
01:24:45,225 --> 01:24:48,106
Let go of my feet.
- But you called and

1000
01:24:48,369 --> 01:24:49,393
Get up.
- Okay.

1001
01:24:49,665 --> 01:24:51,664
Get up and sit down.

1002
01:24:52,063 --> 01:24:53,841
Sit down.
- Here. -Yes.

1003
01:24:55,136 --> 01:24:56,204
Oh!

1004
01:24:58,312 --> 01:25:01,463
Rascal!
How dare you sit on a chair!

1005
01:25:03,069 --> 01:25:04,775
What's wrong with all of you?

1006
01:25:06,072 --> 01:25:07,287
Get into the rooster pose.

1007
01:25:07,929 --> 01:25:09,002
What?

1008
01:25:10,203 --> 01:25:12,584
How dare he sit on a chair!

1009
01:25:15,461 --> 01:25:16,509
Shripad...

1010
01:25:17,129 --> 01:25:18,780
Are you shooting him here?
- No, sir!

1011
01:25:19,084 --> 01:25:20,108
Why are you shooting me?

1012
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,007
It should be as per the plan.
- What do you mean?

1013
01:25:23,916 --> 01:25:25,011
What is the plan?

1014
01:25:25,171 --> 01:25:28,075
You'll find out.
- I came as soon as you called.

1015
01:25:28,936 --> 01:25:30,357
My dear son of mother earth...

1016
01:25:31,703 --> 01:25:34,719
The man you threatened
on the mountain road

1017
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:36,920
was our boss' brother-in-law.

1018
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:40,623
You know how precious
brothers-in-law are!

1019
01:25:40,894 --> 01:25:43,579
Sir, how can I make up for that?

1020
01:25:46,082 --> 01:25:47,642
Jadhav's daughter
needs a heart surgery.

1021
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:48,924
So?

1022
01:25:50,189 --> 01:25:51,305
Give him half a million.

1023
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:53,213
I'll give him one million.

1024
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:54,790
Half is enough.
- Oh no, sir.

1025
01:25:55,053 --> 01:25:56,117
I'll give him one million.

1026
01:25:56,379 --> 01:25:58,863
Hey may need
some more for medicines.

1027
01:26:00,867 --> 01:26:01,899
Is that okay?

1028
01:26:02,392 --> 01:26:03,924
Don't hesitate. Take it.

1029
01:26:04,728 --> 01:26:05,792
Take it.

1030
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,748
It's not his hard-earned money.

1031
01:26:07,936 --> 01:26:09,489
Come forward, son.

1032
01:26:11,624 --> 01:26:14,179
You touched
his feet when he entered.

1033
01:26:14,394 --> 01:26:15,656
Yes, I did.

1034
01:26:16,089 --> 01:26:17,660
Now, give him a kick.

1035
01:26:19,793 --> 01:26:20,817
No, sir.

1036
01:26:22,876 --> 01:26:24,226
Pitya...

1037
01:26:25,148 --> 01:26:26,164
He won't kick you.

1038
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:28,278
Kick me!

1039
01:26:28,564 --> 01:26:29,588
No.

1040
01:26:30,288 --> 01:26:32,319
Kick me, it's okay.
- No, brother Pitya.

1041
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:33,939
Go on!

1042
01:26:35,197 --> 01:26:36,832
Such a hard one!

1043
01:26:37,502 --> 01:26:38,853
I'm sorry.

1044
01:26:39,543 --> 01:26:42,035
Quite a strong boy he is.

1045
01:26:42,985 --> 01:26:44,992
All my pain disappeared.

1046
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:47,217
Inspector Jadhav,

1047
01:26:47,798 --> 01:26:49,600
don't you have to
go to the hospital?

1048
01:26:49,951 --> 01:26:51,744
Your daughter needs a surgery.

1049
01:26:53,972 --> 01:26:55,298
May I leave, sir?

1050
01:26:55,688 --> 01:26:57,529
It's okay. Touch his feet.

1051
01:26:58,332 --> 01:26:59,729
With both your hands.

1052
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:03,227
Let's go, sir.

1053
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:05,038
Come on.

1054
01:27:05,986 --> 01:27:08,255
Let's go, before his mood changes.

1055
01:27:51,691 --> 01:27:53,080
Sir!
- Come on, Uday.

1056
01:27:54,438 --> 01:27:57,506
Don't do that.
- Thank you, sir.

1057
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:05,291
Sir...

1058
01:28:06,015 --> 01:28:07,539
You've set things right at home.

1059
01:28:08,876 --> 01:28:12,185
A lot of school children are
being attracted to these goons.

1060
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:13,950
They consider them God.

1061
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:15,730
God!

1062
01:28:16,017 --> 01:28:17,017
God!

1063
01:28:18,721 --> 01:28:21,858
If there's God,
there must be a procession.

1064
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:25,402
Tomorrow.

1065
01:28:40,874 --> 01:28:42,025
Look up.

1066
01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:45,083
Get lost.

1067
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:46,822
Don't touch me.

1068
01:28:49,389 --> 01:28:50,555
Bend down.

1069
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,250
Go down, your rascal.

1070
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:58,151
Everyone, go down.
- Good idea, sir.

1071
01:28:58,326 --> 01:28:59,381
It's not an idea.

1072
01:29:00,258 --> 01:29:01,639
It's my pattern.

1073
01:29:03,586 --> 01:29:04,944
You should've included Rahul.

1074
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,281
He is the special one.

1075
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:11,229
His procession
will be across the city.

1076
01:29:12,843 --> 01:29:13,867
We'll have it soon.

1077
01:29:15,498 --> 01:29:16,839
His procession will take place.

1078
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,086
Hey, Pitya!

1079
01:29:21,749 --> 01:29:22,915
Look here.

1080
01:29:23,225 --> 01:29:24,376
Look at me.

1081
01:29:26,991 --> 01:29:28,118
This is Rahul's idea.

1082
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,701
It's to curb the fear.

1083
01:29:32,506 --> 01:29:35,037
He got you stripped naked
and left for recovery

1084
01:29:35,485 --> 01:29:36,835
at Shinde's office.

1085
01:29:46,776 --> 01:29:47,824
Listen...

1086
01:29:49,087 --> 01:29:50,730
Farms shouldn't be sold.

1087
01:29:51,774 --> 01:29:53,067
They should be taken care of.

1088
01:29:54,507 --> 01:29:56,102
Otherwise, his children

1089
01:29:57,033 --> 01:29:58,224
will either beg

1090
01:29:59,163 --> 01:30:01,036
or turn criminals like us.

1091
01:30:03,692 --> 01:30:06,398
Take the money they're offering.
I'll handle the rest.

1092
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:07,743
I'll do that.

1093
01:30:07,959 --> 01:30:09,657
Don't tell them
we're waiting downstairs.

1094
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:22,471
Do you remember him?

1095
01:30:23,196 --> 01:30:25,078
Should I get his fingerprints?

1096
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:28,392
Mr Shinde, ten million is too less.

1097
01:30:29,186 --> 01:30:30,242
One and half.

1098
01:30:31,861 --> 01:30:32,908
One and half.

1099
01:30:35,223 --> 01:30:37,159
One and half is final.

1100
01:30:37,671 --> 01:30:38,822
Okay. One and half.

1101
01:30:39,173 --> 01:30:41,816
Don't think too much.
Just sign the papers.

1102
01:30:43,049 --> 01:30:45,264
Let's celebrate with champagne.

1103
01:30:46,713 --> 01:30:48,887
The deal went through
for 30.5 million.

1104
01:30:49,234 --> 01:30:51,321
Fifty for us.
- Fifty for us.

1105
01:30:51,664 --> 01:30:52,965
The total is four.

1106
01:31:00,062 --> 01:31:01,371
Mr Shinde,

1107
01:31:02,024 --> 01:31:05,120
you've earned a profit
of 20.5 million within an hour.

1108
01:31:05,703 --> 01:31:07,306
Not fair.

1109
01:31:10,295 --> 01:31:12,734
Here you are.
- What nonsense is this, Shinde?

1110
01:31:14,436 --> 01:31:15,507
Nice furniture.

1111
01:31:16,414 --> 01:31:17,493
Hello, sir.

1112
01:31:19,297 --> 01:31:20,638
These are new documents.

1113
01:31:21,204 --> 01:31:22,608
They're already signed.

1114
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:24,999
You finalised
the deal for forty million.

1115
01:31:25,462 --> 01:31:26,676
Mr Singhania, isn't it?

1116
01:31:27,987 --> 01:31:31,251
So, the farmer now gets 20.5 million.

1117
01:31:31,913 --> 01:31:33,350
Rahul sir gets ten million.

1118
01:31:34,274 --> 01:31:35,305
And fifty for you.

1119
01:31:36,586 --> 01:31:37,816
Ten million for him?

1120
01:31:39,031 --> 01:31:40,031
Why?

1121
01:31:40,476 --> 01:31:42,437
What's the price
for shooting him, Ganya?

1122
01:31:43,994 --> 01:31:45,003
Two.

1123
01:31:47,135 --> 01:31:50,453
I'm already running
a loss of ten million.

1124
01:31:51,012 --> 01:31:52,211
You promised 1.5.

1125
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:54,197
Make it two.

1126
01:31:58,315 --> 01:31:59,458
Give it to me.

1127
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:02,625
You'll be shot one day, fatty.

1128
01:32:04,837 --> 01:32:06,000
Fatty.

1129
01:32:08,294 --> 01:32:10,564
Fatty was scared.
- Mr Shinde.

1130
01:32:11,455 --> 01:32:13,082
He's an animal.
Watch him.

1131
01:32:24,643 --> 01:32:26,024
Pitya!

1132
01:32:27,511 --> 01:32:30,034
I'll pay as much as you want.

1133
01:32:31,744 --> 01:32:33,014
You'll do as I say.

1134
01:32:41,144 --> 01:32:42,207
Have you seen him?

1135
01:32:42,946 --> 01:32:43,947
Okay.

1136
01:32:44,384 --> 01:32:45,407
Hang up.

1137
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:52,386
Hello.

1138
01:32:53,705 --> 01:32:54,712
Black Scorpio.

1139
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:57,589
Red shirt.
Next to the driver.

1140
01:32:59,028 --> 01:33:00,647
Roll the windows down.

1141
01:33:01,531 --> 01:33:02,531
Come on!

1142
01:33:03,263 --> 01:33:05,310
You're in an AC car
and I'm out in the traffic.

1143
01:33:06,282 --> 01:33:07,750
Wait, I'm coming over.
- Rahul!

1144
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:09,482
I was joking, Rahul.

1145
01:33:12,106 --> 01:33:13,717
You didn't have to get out.

1146
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:17,701
"You called out to me, I came over"
- Get in the car, Rahul.

1147
01:33:17,905 --> 01:33:20,704
I won't go back.
I'll ride the bike.

1148
01:33:20,934 --> 01:33:22,261
Don't you have to go to school?

1149
01:33:22,473 --> 01:33:24,116
It's Gandhiji's birthday.
It's a holiday.

1150
01:33:24,251 --> 01:33:25,481
Get into the car.

1151
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:27,672
Rahul, get back into the car.

1152
01:33:27,797 --> 01:33:29,567
I'm not going in.
- Please tell him.

1153
01:33:29,767 --> 01:33:31,172
All of you get in.

1154
01:33:31,714 --> 01:33:33,000
Come on, get into the car.

1155
01:33:33,455 --> 01:33:35,359
If Agarwal found out,
you're on a two-wheeler

1156
01:33:35,512 --> 01:33:37,956
he'll be scared.
- He must be scared. Kick start.

1157
01:33:43,257 --> 01:33:44,707
Turned right
from More High School.

1158
01:33:50,577 --> 01:33:52,658
Turned in from the main road.
- You get out of there.

1159
01:33:59,695 --> 01:34:01,282
He'll be at Agarwal's in a minute.

1160
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,539
There's a Black Scorpio. Hurry up!

1161
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:06,547
Hurry up!
He must not be spared!

1162
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:13,684
Hello, he's not in the car.
He's on a bike behind it.

1163
01:34:14,092 --> 01:34:15,188
What?

1164
01:34:21,869 --> 01:34:23,321
He's coming from behind.

1165
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:33,682
Rahul, bend down.

1166
01:34:33,953 --> 01:34:35,612
What a confusion!

1167
01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:37,318
Rahul, bend down.

1168
01:34:39,307 --> 01:34:40,695
Get him!

1169
01:34:46,538 --> 01:34:47,863
Manya!

1170
01:34:54,704 --> 01:34:58,435
You idiot!
Why did you get into the car?

1171
01:34:59,034 --> 01:35:01,241
Listen to me, Rahul.
- I told you not to come with us.

1172
01:35:01,337 --> 01:35:04,004
I told you not to accompany us.
You'll die some day.

1173
01:35:04,285 --> 01:35:05,595
Why did you come along?

1174
01:35:05,898 --> 01:35:08,097
He came because of you.
Don't you know how risky it is?

1175
01:35:09,283 --> 01:35:10,807
You managed to escape,
because I came.

1176
01:35:11,301 --> 01:35:13,285
Do you think, you're too smart?

1177
01:35:13,525 --> 01:35:16,343
Are you too smart?
- He looks up to you.

1178
01:35:17,561 --> 01:35:19,259
You have no brains!

1179
01:35:30,265 --> 01:35:31,281
Give me the gun.

1180
01:35:32,236 --> 01:35:33,569
He's too young.
- Give it to me.

1181
01:35:34,095 --> 01:35:36,134
Rahul!
- I said, give me the gun!

1182
01:35:38,847 --> 01:35:39,878
Rahul...

1183
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:41,541
He has lost it.

1184
01:35:45,776 --> 01:35:47,237
Keep it in your bag.

1185
01:35:48,208 --> 01:35:50,581
You'll need it.
Okay?

1186
01:35:55,389 --> 01:35:56,667
Rahul...

1187
01:35:57,353 --> 01:35:58,369
Rahul...

1188
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,982
He's a child.
Does he really need it?

1189
01:36:05,545 --> 01:36:07,942
He may help if we're in trouble.

1190
01:36:09,302 --> 01:36:10,587
He's too young.

1191
01:36:11,749 --> 01:36:12,915
What if he shot at random?

1192
01:36:15,077 --> 01:36:16,189
It's such a mess!

1193
01:36:25,182 --> 01:36:27,507
Will you answer,
if I call you when I need you?

1194
01:37:08,556 --> 01:37:09,818
Answer it!

1195
01:37:11,514 --> 01:37:13,676
Answer it!

1196
01:37:14,478 --> 01:37:17,041
Where is Manya?
Why isn't he answering the phone?

1197
01:37:17,695 --> 01:37:19,418
It's like a difficult fort.

1198
01:37:19,991 --> 01:37:21,951
The most adept
of climbers would lose balance.

1199
01:37:22,653 --> 01:37:25,256
If something happened to him,
I'll punish you all.

1200
01:37:25,663 --> 01:37:26,925
That's none of your business.

1201
01:37:29,057 --> 01:37:30,335
What's going on, sir?

1202
01:37:30,623 --> 01:37:32,773
Why hold the child
for something between us?

1203
01:37:33,529 --> 01:37:35,101
He is quite attached to me.

1204
01:37:35,309 --> 01:37:36,841
Call Daya and Pitya right now.

1205
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:38,923
I am also quite attached to him.

1206
01:37:39,298 --> 01:37:40,980
Only you can help me.

1207
01:37:41,514 --> 01:37:43,122
He's a very gentle boy.
- There he is.

1208
01:37:44,534 --> 01:37:46,534
You piece of crap,
where had you been?

1209
01:37:46,692 --> 01:37:48,558
Rahul, wait.
- Where had you been?

1210
01:37:48,734 --> 01:37:50,876
Where had you been?
- Why do you want to hit him?

1211
01:37:51,086 --> 01:37:52,126
Rahul, he's a child.

1212
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:55,693
Doesn't he know he has to call?
Why have I given him the phone?

1213
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:02,900
Where had you been?

1214
01:38:05,324 --> 01:38:07,427
I told you to stop coming over.

1215
01:38:09,098 --> 01:38:11,265
They told us at school
that it's the teachers' day.

1216
01:38:12,347 --> 01:38:14,212
We must offer flowers
to our teachers.

1217
01:38:15,518 --> 01:38:16,637
That's why I got late.

1218
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,506
What do you think
about the love story?

1219
01:38:28,365 --> 01:38:31,303
Good Lord!
The demon has tears in his eyes.

1220
01:38:32,242 --> 01:38:33,361
Hey, Rahul...

1221
01:38:33,847 --> 01:38:35,251
Where did you find him?

1222
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:38,144
He's quite a character.

1223
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:40,201
Where did we find you?

1224
01:38:45,556 --> 01:38:46,612
Action scene?

1225
01:38:49,847 --> 01:38:51,530
Ganya, stop the car.

1226
01:38:52,073 --> 01:38:53,581
Do you want to watch the fight?

1227
01:38:57,086 --> 01:38:58,086
Rahul...

1228
01:38:58,713 --> 01:39:01,970
shall we get the boys, who're
beating up, to join the gang?

1229
01:39:02,577 --> 01:39:05,180
Instead, get the one,
who's getting beaten up.

1230
01:39:05,364 --> 01:39:06,658
What's going on?
- He's the hero.

1231
01:39:06,945 --> 01:39:09,026
Let go! Go away!

1232
01:39:09,415 --> 01:39:10,733
There comes the teacher.

1233
01:39:11,578 --> 01:39:12,602
Stop!

1234
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:14,698
What's going on?

1235
01:39:14,914 --> 01:39:17,867
Tell me who beat you up.
I'll rusticate all of them.

1236
01:39:19,063 --> 01:39:20,492
They weren't beating me up.
- What?

1237
01:39:21,636 --> 01:39:23,716
I got hurt while we were playing.
- What game was it?

1238
01:39:24,013 --> 01:39:27,950
Who taught you such games?
Nonsense! Get your father.

1239
01:39:29,138 --> 01:39:31,939
Playing games.
- He got scared, Rahul.

1240
01:39:33,236 --> 01:39:35,181
Why did you lie to the teacher?

1241
01:39:35,802 --> 01:39:36,985
If he rusticated you,

1242
01:39:38,299 --> 01:39:39,815
how could I take revenge?

1243
01:39:42,055 --> 01:39:43,135
Ganesh...

1244
01:39:45,361 --> 01:39:47,567
That's raw material.
- I agree.

1245
01:39:48,522 --> 01:39:49,546
Raw material.

1246
01:39:51,052 --> 01:39:52,639
This is raw material for crime.

1247
01:39:54,419 --> 01:39:56,149
Don't take it wrong.

1248
01:39:57,015 --> 01:39:58,047
I love him.

1249
01:39:58,431 --> 01:39:59,748
You should be ashamed.

1250
01:40:01,901 --> 01:40:03,171
They're our country's future.

1251
01:40:03,681 --> 01:40:05,357
You're destroying
the future generations.

1252
01:40:07,415 --> 01:40:08,883
You're all farmers' children.

1253
01:40:11,563 --> 01:40:15,285
Do farmers destroy their own crops?

1254
01:40:16,862 --> 01:40:19,363
Farmers grow crops.
They don't destroy it.

1255
01:40:19,642 --> 01:40:21,634
Everyone has already
left us helpless.

1256
01:40:22,726 --> 01:40:26,203
They took our land and then
- Why is it always about the land?

1257
01:40:27,469 --> 01:40:29,159
Our parents gave them away.

1258
01:40:29,819 --> 01:40:30,994
They didn't.

1259
01:40:31,329 --> 01:40:32,718
They were forced to sell them off.

1260
01:40:33,022 --> 01:40:35,585
They sold a fifty-square-feet
for five hundred.

1261
01:40:35,786 --> 01:40:38,113
Were they sold for free?

1262
01:40:38,575 --> 01:40:40,067
They were paid in millions.

1263
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:41,823
They got millions,

1264
01:40:42,857 --> 01:40:45,579
but why didn't our parents know
how to spend them wisely?

1265
01:40:47,991 --> 01:40:50,350
Who would've told them what to do?

1266
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:52,008
The Government.

1267
01:40:53,036 --> 01:40:56,845
The MIDCs, IT parks and
hill stations were farmlands.

1268
01:40:57,063 --> 01:40:59,778
The Government should've told them
what to do with the money.

1269
01:41:00,178 --> 01:41:03,130
Each murderer has his own ideas.

1270
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:05,299
Just like your parents,

1271
01:41:07,501 --> 01:41:09,247
my parents were also duped.

1272
01:41:10,759 --> 01:41:11,804
But I

1273
01:41:12,555 --> 01:41:13,595
became a policeman.

1274
01:41:13,962 --> 01:41:16,852
What did you achieve
by becoming a policeman?

1275
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:21,089
Shut up!

1276
01:41:21,933 --> 01:41:23,218
Did you touch the sky

1277
01:41:23,688 --> 01:41:24,695
by becoming a criminal?

1278
01:41:25,714 --> 01:41:26,730
Tell me.

1279
01:41:27,661 --> 01:41:31,590
The area, from where my parents
were unceremoniously thrown out

1280
01:41:35,533 --> 01:41:38,763
is where
I own 100 acres of land.

1281
01:41:39,609 --> 01:41:40,648
How much?

1282
01:41:41,150 --> 01:41:43,063
Hundred acres!

1283
01:41:45,043 --> 01:41:46,615
But your father
still works as a porter.

1284
01:41:55,015 --> 01:41:57,332
I bought half an acre of land
with my honest earnings.

1285
01:41:59,599 --> 01:42:01,309
Only half an acre.

1286
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:04,832
My father uses it for farming.

1287
01:42:08,308 --> 01:42:09,316
He holds his head high.

1288
01:42:13,241 --> 01:42:15,860
If your parents can
proudly hold their head high

1289
01:42:16,511 --> 01:42:17,566
you're a worthy son.

1290
01:42:19,793 --> 01:42:20,848
It's not too late.

1291
01:42:23,202 --> 01:42:24,218
Mend your ways.

1292
01:42:34,459 --> 01:42:35,466
And son...

1293
01:42:37,328 --> 01:42:39,027
A teacher shows you the right path,

1294
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:41,426
doesn't misguide you.

1295
01:42:44,574 --> 01:42:45,606
Come on.

1296
01:42:46,789 --> 01:42:49,489
It's useless to break our heads
trying to convince them.

1297
01:42:58,177 --> 01:42:59,542
Rahul,

1298
01:43:00,448 --> 01:43:01,519
a call for you.

1299
01:43:05,436 --> 01:43:06,548
Yes.
- Rahul...

1300
01:43:07,081 --> 01:43:08,719
Shinde wanted you murdered.

1301
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:10,531
Have you confirmed it?
- Hundred per cent.

1302
01:43:34,075 --> 01:43:35,123
Rahul...

1303
01:43:36,625 --> 01:43:38,012
My wife and children are with me.

1304
01:43:42,201 --> 01:43:43,225
Ganya...

1305
01:43:59,808 --> 01:44:01,038
Die!

1306
01:44:04,075 --> 01:44:05,948
Keep stabbing him
even after he's dead.

1307
01:44:06,758 --> 01:44:10,602
No one should dare to buy our land.
Get it?

1308
01:44:18,655 --> 01:44:21,480
Kill him right now!

1309
01:44:21,694 --> 01:44:24,448
He brought MIDC to our village.

1310
01:44:24,816 --> 01:44:26,443
He got the hill-station.

1311
01:44:26,842 --> 01:44:29,572
Kill him.
Don't bother about him.

1312
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:50,125
Rahul, the man of substance!
He'll be your new MLA

1313
01:44:50,849 --> 01:44:51,649
Appasaheb Tarde,
MLA, Mulshi Constituency.

1314
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:54,537
His birthday is in the next week,
but the hoarding is already up.

1315
01:44:54,712 --> 01:44:55,903
He slapped the client.

1316
01:44:56,095 --> 01:44:57,759
He's interfering
with all our businesses.

1317
01:44:57,928 --> 01:44:59,583
He won't let
anyone lay cables in Pune.

1318
01:44:59,813 --> 01:45:02,678
He has held sand supplier trucks
near Uruli Kanchan.

1319
01:45:02,848 --> 01:45:06,206
He's interfering with builders.
- He too 600 flats from Dahanukar.

1320
01:45:06,335 --> 01:45:07,994
He won't let us do anything.

1321
01:45:08,241 --> 01:45:09,829
Stop! Shut up!

1322
01:45:10,132 --> 01:45:12,013
Appa, I was thinking
- Shut up there!

1323
01:45:12,937 --> 01:45:14,247
We're all from the same taluka.

1324
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:16,355
We'll grow,
if we share everything.

1325
01:45:16,594 --> 01:45:18,062
Why don't you slay the demon first?

1326
01:45:18,357 --> 01:45:19,983
He wants to have
everything for himself.

1327
01:45:20,391 --> 01:45:22,177
He doesn't want
to leave the scraps too.

1328
01:45:22,322 --> 01:45:25,409
One moment.
Forget about us, Appa.

1329
01:45:25,912 --> 01:45:27,603
Shinde was your man.

1330
01:45:27,731 --> 01:45:30,168
He killed him brutally.
- Will you...

1331
01:45:32,506 --> 01:45:34,851
I've called him for a compromise.
Speak up when he's here.

1332
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,803
Here he comes!

1333
01:45:38,441 --> 01:45:42,546
Children, your father is here!

1334
01:45:45,052 --> 01:45:46,679
Make way.

1335
01:45:49,836 --> 01:45:52,677
Mr MLA, greetings.
- To you too.

1336
01:45:53,083 --> 01:45:54,170
Get up.

1337
01:45:54,703 --> 01:45:56,537
Why don't you shift?

1338
01:45:56,915 --> 01:45:58,105
Why move him?

1339
01:46:00,903 --> 01:46:03,514
Yes, Pitya.
What do we compromise on?

1340
01:46:04,867 --> 01:46:05,907
Rahul...

1341
01:46:06,543 --> 01:46:07,909
Mittal is my man.

1342
01:46:08,227 --> 01:46:09,235
Why?

1343
01:46:10,152 --> 01:46:11,914
Have you adopted him?

1344
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:16,443
I adopted him for ten million.

1345
01:46:16,737 --> 01:46:17,744
Listen.

1346
01:46:18,054 --> 01:46:20,523
Don't interfere
with Mulshi litigation cases.

1347
01:46:22,856 --> 01:46:24,038
My dear friend,

1348
01:46:24,286 --> 01:46:26,992
we don't let a mango ripen
without permission.

1349
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:29,201
How can we let Mittal buy land?
- Hey!

1350
01:46:30,086 --> 01:46:32,570
Do your parents own the taluka?

1351
01:46:33,797 --> 01:46:36,487
Oh my! He dragged the parents in!

1352
01:46:38,442 --> 01:46:41,030
Then whose parents' own it?

1353
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:44,085
We'll get in touch with them
to assert our ownership.

1354
01:46:47,688 --> 01:46:48,770
Take your hand off.

1355
01:46:49,025 --> 01:46:50,088
Listen.

1356
01:46:51,011 --> 01:46:52,408
I'm an MLA.

1357
01:46:54,165 --> 01:46:55,991
I've shot twice the number

1358
01:46:57,008 --> 01:46:58,286
of people you've shot.

1359
01:47:00,919 --> 01:47:01,935
Appa!

1360
01:47:03,763 --> 01:47:05,271
I don't shoot.

1361
01:47:06,973 --> 01:47:08,171
I...

1362
01:47:08,648 --> 01:47:09,751
Chop them.

1363
01:47:12,272 --> 01:47:13,820
My pattern is different.

1364
01:47:15,187 --> 01:47:16,726
You better lower the volume

1365
01:47:18,906 --> 01:47:19,970
and always keep it low.

1366
01:47:22,632 --> 01:47:23,648
Because,

1367
01:47:24,523 --> 01:47:25,770
you're growing old.

1368
01:47:27,996 --> 01:47:30,798
Your body can't take
post-mortem at this age.

1369
01:47:35,224 --> 01:47:37,422
Don't try to be
the king of negotiations.

1370
01:47:38,314 --> 01:47:40,148
Give me your blessings, Appa.

1371
01:47:41,328 --> 01:47:45,978
Didn't Mittal ask Pitya
to threaten the old farmer?

1372
01:47:47,658 --> 01:47:49,524
Mittal!

1373
01:47:53,616 --> 01:47:56,299
Farmers are becoming extinct.

1374
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,758
You should let them
continue farming.

1375
01:48:00,792 --> 01:48:03,292
Why did you kill him?
- I was stupid. It was a mistake.

1376
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,968
I only asked them

1377
01:48:05,478 --> 01:48:08,868
to take his farm land.
I didn't ask them to kill him.

1378
01:48:09,596 --> 01:48:11,175
Hey, Mittal,

1379
01:48:12,129 --> 01:48:14,780
you own about
1.5-2 thousand acres of land.

1380
01:48:16,404 --> 01:48:18,856
Why bother about his ten-acre land?

1381
01:48:19,741 --> 01:48:23,019
I'll pay for the damages.
- Oh really?

1382
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:27,052
Will you pay his cattle and dogs?

1383
01:48:27,762 --> 01:48:29,048
What should I do to make up?

1384
01:48:29,544 --> 01:48:31,504
Did you get it
for chopping vegetables?

1385
01:48:32,373 --> 01:48:34,651
No! No!

1386
01:48:34,786 --> 01:48:37,057
You deserve the Mulshi pattern.

1387
01:48:38,655 --> 01:48:42,196
I'll dig your grave in the shed,
where you killed the old man.

1388
01:48:42,547 --> 01:48:45,849
Shoot the murder.
Let the clip go viral.

1389
01:48:46,275 --> 01:48:48,997
Shoot it. Pick him up.
Let's chop his hands and legs.

1390
01:48:49,063 --> 01:48:52,063
You want our farmlands, don't you?

1391
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,995
One, two,

1392
01:48:55,156 --> 01:48:57,259
Three!
- No!

1393
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:15,060
It's a good idea.

1394
01:49:15,768 --> 01:49:16,943
A very good idea.

1395
01:49:18,745 --> 01:49:19,809
Isn't it?

1396
01:49:22,129 --> 01:49:23,637
What happened?

1397
01:49:29,513 --> 01:49:30,870
I'll introduce you.

1398
01:49:33,685 --> 01:49:34,947
What happened?

1399
01:49:37,885 --> 01:49:38,925
What happened?

1400
01:49:43,399 --> 01:49:48,490
I've told a thousand times,
to stop working for people.

1401
01:49:48,883 --> 01:49:51,168
You don't want to stay with me
and work for a...

1402
01:49:52,433 --> 01:49:53,743
Why do you work for him?

1403
01:49:53,933 --> 01:49:55,370
He showers me with love.

1404
01:49:56,483 --> 01:49:59,499
You had it from me!
- Stop!

1405
01:50:00,477 --> 01:50:02,247
Don't you dare touch my daughter.

1406
01:50:02,483 --> 01:50:05,589
You're a good in your area,
not my home.

1407
01:50:08,981 --> 01:50:10,997
She slept with that rascal!

1408
01:50:12,875 --> 01:50:15,597
She's a 30-year-old woman,
who's been dumped by her husband.

1409
01:50:16,569 --> 01:50:18,188
She has needs.

1410
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:29,843
If your daughter has needs,
why don't you get her married?

1411
01:50:31,998 --> 01:50:35,333
Who would marry her,
after knowing who her brother is?

1412
01:50:36,224 --> 01:50:38,153
Get her married!

1413
01:50:40,388 --> 01:50:41,674
I'll get her married.

1414
01:50:42,296 --> 01:50:45,162
I'll get her married in two days.
Okay?

1415
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:48,245
Whom will you get her married to?

1416
01:50:49,634 --> 01:50:50,721
Whom?

1417
01:50:53,099 --> 01:50:54,178
This one?

1418
01:50:56,009 --> 01:50:57,168
Or That one?

1419
01:50:58,679 --> 01:51:02,124
You'll get her married
to a man, who doesn't know

1420
01:51:02,617 --> 01:51:04,459
if he's going to be alive
the next moment.

1421
01:51:11,334 --> 01:51:12,762
She supports her.

1422
01:51:15,362 --> 01:51:16,822
You may think so.

1423
01:51:18,636 --> 01:51:23,320
No one gives us groceries
for free, because our son's a goon.

1424
01:51:23,943 --> 01:51:26,054
We have to pay to buy food.

1425
01:51:26,539 --> 01:51:28,293
She brings the money for that.

1426
01:51:29,343 --> 01:51:30,359
What?

1427
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:32,896
Aren't you ashamed?

1428
01:51:34,478 --> 01:51:36,541
Why doesn't
the porter say something?

1429
01:51:36,677 --> 01:51:37,844
What will he say?

1430
01:51:39,665 --> 01:51:42,276
He lost the right to speak up

1431
01:51:44,305 --> 01:51:46,028
when he sold his farmland.

1432
01:51:51,394 --> 01:51:54,545
Now, until he's dead,
he must only listen.

1433
01:52:00,038 --> 01:52:02,665
Get out of here right now!

1434
01:52:07,393 --> 01:52:11,004
We're used to living without you.

1435
01:52:14,367 --> 01:52:16,153
If I'm an eyesore,

1436
01:52:19,841 --> 01:52:21,754
why do you have my photograph here?

1437
01:52:24,181 --> 01:52:25,633
If you get killed

1438
01:52:26,945 --> 01:52:27,961
we'll need it.

1439
01:52:28,877 --> 01:52:30,131
We'll put garlands on it.

1440
01:52:34,343 --> 01:52:37,271
Rahul
- Don't touch me. You deserve

1441
01:52:39,537 --> 01:52:43,363
Get out of here right now!
- Rahul!

1442
01:52:45,283 --> 01:52:49,005
It must be time
to collect your taxes.

1443
01:53:26,831 --> 01:53:29,823
Boys, don't follow him.

1444
01:53:31,653 --> 01:53:35,171
He has turned into a beast.

1445
01:54:41,099 --> 01:54:42,250
Rahul...

1446
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:46,381
Rahul, we can hear you.

1447
01:54:46,733 --> 01:54:48,296
The boys are listening.

1448
01:55:00,174 --> 01:55:01,181
What is it?

1449
01:55:01,874 --> 01:55:02,922
No.

1450
01:55:05,433 --> 01:55:06,465
What?

1451
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,255
What?

1452
01:55:10,201 --> 01:55:11,233
Wait!

1453
01:55:11,457 --> 01:55:12,481
Rahul...

1454
01:55:12,856 --> 01:55:14,583
We've found the man,
we've been looking for.

1455
01:55:14,786 --> 01:55:16,500
He's at Kishkindha Nagar.
Let's go.

1456
01:55:25,379 --> 01:55:27,236
Chandya, take the next lane.

1457
01:55:27,618 --> 01:55:29,238
Take the one opposite.

1458
01:55:30,019 --> 01:55:32,051
Get hold of him.
He's running away.

1459
01:55:33,174 --> 01:55:35,730
Get into this lane.

1460
01:55:42,763 --> 01:55:44,819
Got him!

1461
01:55:45,448 --> 01:55:47,202
Chop him like a lamb!

1462
01:56:42,430 --> 01:56:44,708
We must be loyal to our country.

1463
01:56:45,043 --> 01:56:46,701
Everyone lives for themselves.

1464
01:56:46,965 --> 01:56:49,172
What we do for
our country is important.

1465
01:56:49,572 --> 01:56:51,786
Sir, Manya ran away with his bag!
- Manya!

1466
01:57:01,433 --> 01:57:02,640
Hello.

1467
01:57:03,181 --> 01:57:04,250
Hello.

1468
01:57:08,682 --> 01:57:10,721
Hello.

1469
01:57:17,563 --> 01:57:20,167
Hello.

1470
01:57:43,168 --> 01:57:44,819
Rahul!

1471
01:57:52,328 --> 01:57:54,384
Ganya!
- Rahul!

1472
01:57:54,551 --> 01:57:56,027
Ganya!

1473
01:57:56,217 --> 01:57:57,297
Ganya!

1474
01:58:01,850 --> 01:58:05,382
Like I said,
I won't let anyone hurt you!

1475
01:58:11,916 --> 01:58:13,106
Where had you been?

1476
01:58:14,094 --> 01:58:17,254
Look! They made me bleed.

1477
01:58:17,652 --> 01:58:18,749
And this...

1478
01:58:19,107 --> 01:58:21,719
They attacked me from behind.

1479
01:58:21,974 --> 01:58:24,188
They attacked me.

1480
01:58:25,334 --> 01:58:28,589
Were you planning to come after
I was dead? - I'm here now!

1481
01:58:29,117 --> 01:58:30,625
We'll drain
all the blood out of them!

1482
01:58:41,744 --> 01:58:42,847
He can see Ganya?

1483
01:58:43,682 --> 01:58:44,952
Has he lost it?

1484
01:58:45,239 --> 01:58:47,112
Come on!

1485
01:58:50,070 --> 01:58:52,951
Both your sisters and your brother
have signed. What's your problem?

1486
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:54,524
Ganya...

1487
01:58:55,248 --> 01:58:56,549
I don't want to sell the land.

1488
01:58:58,998 --> 01:59:00,030
Why?

1489
01:59:01,032 --> 01:59:02,492
Do you have a deal with Mittal?

1490
01:59:03,155 --> 01:59:05,186
Who is Mittal?
- You don't know?

1491
01:59:05,481 --> 01:59:07,370
You know,
how Shinde was killed, don't you?

1492
01:59:08,198 --> 01:59:09,216
Listen to me.

1493
01:59:10,152 --> 01:59:13,271
Agarwal has already bought
all the plots around yours.

1494
01:59:13,943 --> 01:59:14,995
Yes.

1495
01:59:15,684 --> 01:59:16,692
But...

1496
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:20,829
He can't do anything
without buying my plot.

1497
01:59:21,198 --> 01:59:22,412
Mr Balwadkar...

1498
01:59:22,843 --> 01:59:25,993
You rascal
- Rahul, mind your tongue.

1499
01:59:27,188 --> 01:59:29,180
Is that a laughter club?

1500
01:59:30,907 --> 01:59:33,789
Why are you being difficult?

1501
01:59:34,124 --> 01:59:36,592
Ganya, I don't want
to sell the land.

1502
01:59:39,263 --> 01:59:41,144
Listen
- Are they laughing at us?

1503
01:59:41,816 --> 01:59:44,729
Why would they do that?
- He just looked at me.

1504
01:59:45,197 --> 01:59:46,443
Why are they laughing?

1505
01:59:46,578 --> 01:59:48,618
Why are they laughing?
- Can anyone dare to do that?

1506
01:59:48,685 --> 01:59:51,558
I thought, he looked at me.
- Ignore them. Look at him.

1507
01:59:52,219 --> 01:59:53,536
Hey Balwadkar,

1508
01:59:53,879 --> 01:59:54,943
you better listen.

1509
01:59:58,696 --> 02:00:01,236
They're laughing at us, Balwadkar?
- Not at all.

1510
02:00:01,429 --> 02:00:04,231
They're laughing at us.
- Ganya, please tell him.

1511
02:00:04,519 --> 02:00:06,423
What's the matter?

1512
02:00:07,070 --> 02:00:09,641
Why are they laughing?
- They're a simple family.

1513
02:00:09,738 --> 02:00:11,063
Let's talk to him.
- Ganya...

1514
02:00:11,263 --> 02:00:12,501
Listen
- What?

1515
02:00:13,066 --> 02:00:14,654
You know, my father...

1516
02:00:17,255 --> 02:00:18,700
I was just thinking,

1517
02:00:20,241 --> 02:00:22,257
I don't remember him laughing.

1518
02:00:24,516 --> 02:00:25,596
Forget it.

1519
02:00:26,153 --> 02:00:27,669
Why are they laughing so much?

1520
02:00:28,647 --> 02:00:29,925
We'll speak with them.

1521
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:32,560
Forget it.
- Why? Why are they laughing?

1522
02:00:32,905 --> 02:00:35,065
What's the problem if they do?
- Why are they laughing?

1523
02:00:35,113 --> 02:00:37,256
Why should they laugh so much?

1524
02:00:38,156 --> 02:00:40,736
How much do you think
is his salary?

1525
02:00:41,286 --> 02:00:43,064
About 20-25 thousand. That's it.

1526
02:00:43,183 --> 02:00:45,516
20-25 thousand.
- 20-25 thousand?

1527
02:00:45,726 --> 02:00:48,736
Only that much?
If I shoot Balwadkar right now

1528
02:00:48,839 --> 02:00:49,839
Control him!

1529
02:00:49,928 --> 02:00:52,166
I'll get twenty million for that.

1530
02:00:52,335 --> 02:00:55,977
But if I give that money to
my father, he won't laugh at all.

1531
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:58,258
What's the matter, Rahul?

1532
02:00:58,768 --> 02:00:59,800
What is it?

1533
02:01:00,437 --> 02:01:03,088
Why are they laughing?

1534
02:01:03,225 --> 02:01:05,042
Ganya, please control him.

1535
02:01:08,349 --> 02:01:09,500
What's wrong?

1536
02:01:10,169 --> 02:01:12,875
Rahul, ignore them.
They aren't laughing at us.

1537
02:01:15,286 --> 02:01:16,698
Have some water.

1538
02:01:16,994 --> 02:01:18,065
I'm going to kill them.

1539
02:01:18,266 --> 02:01:20,210
I'm going to kill them.
- No! No!

1540
02:01:20,513 --> 02:01:22,529
Don't.
- I want to kill them.

1541
02:01:22,714 --> 02:01:24,579
It's getting to me.
I'll kill them.

1542
02:01:24,716 --> 02:01:26,216
Quiet!
- Why are they laughing at us?

1543
02:01:26,464 --> 02:01:28,298
Please let me kill them.
- Listen!

1544
02:01:28,885 --> 02:01:30,068
It's troubling you, isn't it?

1545
02:01:33,138 --> 02:01:34,479
Let's kill one of them.
- No!

1546
02:01:34,672 --> 02:01:37,744
Let's kill the son.
- Wait a minute.

1547
02:01:38,143 --> 02:01:39,350
Listen...

1548
02:01:39,570 --> 02:01:42,356
Let's kill the son.
- But the father was loud.

1549
02:01:42,879 --> 02:01:44,506
Both of them.
- No!

1550
02:01:44,619 --> 02:01:46,587
Come on. Let's get done.

1551
02:01:48,796 --> 02:01:50,344
Have some sweet.

1552
02:01:52,085 --> 02:01:53,101
Here.

1553
02:01:53,714 --> 02:01:55,674
My son got an admission
in an engineering college.

1554
02:01:56,010 --> 02:01:57,446
It was without donation.

1555
02:01:58,098 --> 02:01:59,503
I couldn't have afforded it.

1556
02:01:59,838 --> 02:02:01,060
He understood that.

1557
02:02:01,858 --> 02:02:03,310
He unburdened his father.

1558
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:05,225
What would a father ask for?

1559
02:02:05,632 --> 02:02:06,759
Take it.

1560
02:02:07,276 --> 02:02:09,975
Which college is he joining?
- COET.

1561
02:02:11,671 --> 02:02:13,210
You must also have it.

1562
02:02:17,502 --> 02:02:18,891
Everyone must have it.

1563
02:02:20,371 --> 02:02:22,181
Rahul!

1564
02:02:27,281 --> 02:02:29,050
Wait.

1565
02:02:30,904 --> 02:02:32,253
They were spared.

1566
02:02:32,751 --> 02:02:33,870
I'll tell you later.

1567
02:02:35,492 --> 02:02:37,252
Yes, Rahul.
- Ganya, will you speak with him?

1568
02:02:37,517 --> 02:02:38,596
Yes, I will.

1569
02:02:38,843 --> 02:02:40,359
I'll get done
with something important.

1570
02:02:40,383 --> 02:02:41,533
Okay.

1571
02:02:42,385 --> 02:02:43,821
I know where you're going.

1572
02:02:47,233 --> 02:02:48,757
I know you.

1573
02:03:00,259 --> 02:03:02,706
Chandya, watch him.

1574
02:03:03,113 --> 02:03:05,398
Once he's done,
take the Lakshmi road.

1575
02:03:05,702 --> 02:03:07,448
Don't get into the traffic.

1576
02:03:07,641 --> 02:03:09,601
We'll come over to Lakshmi Road.

1577
02:03:09,946 --> 02:03:11,938
There will be
about 1,500-2,000 boys.

1578
02:03:12,081 --> 02:03:13,954
Then we can go.

1579
02:03:14,075 --> 02:03:17,043
Dancing on the streets!

1580
02:03:17,308 --> 02:03:18,308
Okay?

1581
02:03:20,852 --> 02:03:22,003
Listen, Ganya...

1582
02:03:23,196 --> 02:03:25,005
If Balwadkar doesn't budge,

1583
02:03:27,802 --> 02:03:28,834
let him go.

1584
02:03:30,090 --> 02:03:31,097
Come on.

1585
02:03:43,391 --> 02:03:45,288
Where's sir?
- He's in there.

1586
02:03:45,861 --> 02:03:46,725
Yes, sir.

1587
02:03:46,837 --> 02:03:48,138
You're at Kumthekar?
- Yes, sir.

1588
02:03:48,774 --> 02:03:50,935
It's where the drunk men come.

1589
02:03:51,142 --> 02:03:52,174
Sir...

1590
02:03:52,747 --> 02:03:53,859
Solid news.

1591
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:56,629
Rahul will be killed
during the procession tonight.

1592
02:03:57,334 --> 02:03:58,580
It's confirmed.

1593
02:04:01,108 --> 02:04:02,187
Did you just find out?

1594
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:04,887
Change your sources, Uday.

1595
02:04:05,454 --> 02:04:06,946
Your network is falling apart.

1596
02:04:07,782 --> 02:04:11,067
Rahul is being targeted
and it's a part of a plan.

1597
02:04:11,691 --> 02:04:13,262
All his boys
have turned against him

1598
02:04:13,605 --> 02:04:14,994
including his driver.

1599
02:04:15,728 --> 02:04:17,592
Let's see how long
the plastic lasts.

1600
02:04:19,015 --> 02:04:20,095
Sakhya...

1601
02:04:21,551 --> 02:04:23,058
Your son is here.

1602
02:04:23,498 --> 02:04:25,252
He has bought the entire area.

1603
02:04:52,037 --> 02:04:53,053
Ten million!

1604
02:05:19,184 --> 02:05:20,557
Father, could you smile?

1605
02:05:24,693 --> 02:05:27,169
I haven't seen you
smiling for years.

1606
02:05:30,986 --> 02:05:32,097
Take ten million from me.

1607
02:05:33,186 --> 02:05:34,298
Take more.

1608
02:05:38,587 --> 02:05:40,032
But please give me a smile.

1609
02:05:42,329 --> 02:05:43,361
Smile, please.

1610
02:05:49,289 --> 02:05:51,369
You may think being a porter
has taken away my smile.

1611
02:05:52,616 --> 02:05:53,775
But that's not the case.

1612
02:05:57,194 --> 02:05:58,503
Your crime took it away.

1613
02:06:02,652 --> 02:06:04,644
I'm responsible for that.

1614
02:06:08,947 --> 02:06:09,955
For once,

1615
02:06:11,377 --> 02:06:12,615
give up crime.

1616
02:06:15,118 --> 02:06:16,793
I promise, I'll laugh.

1617
02:06:19,892 --> 02:06:20,908
Will you?

1618
02:06:40,672 --> 02:06:41,679
I'll take your leave.

1619
02:06:45,819 --> 02:06:46,915
Son...

1620
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:49,958
Take your crimes along.

1621
02:07:36,101 --> 02:07:37,386
Hey, Rahul!

1622
02:07:38,533 --> 02:07:39,676
Rahul!

1623
02:07:40,050 --> 02:07:44,297
All the goons
grow up to the porters.

1624
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:47,687
Tell him
what the porters used to be.

1625
02:07:48,056 --> 02:07:49,914
They become porters.

1626
02:09:08,552 --> 02:09:10,329
Shinde, we must leave.
- Okay.

1627
02:09:10,536 --> 02:09:12,028
Daya and Pitya's boys are free.

1628
02:09:12,141 --> 02:09:13,903
The music should
go off by midnight.

1629
02:09:14,070 --> 02:09:16,372
All of them.
- Shinde, do you have the wireless?

1630
02:09:16,572 --> 02:09:17,640
I'll stay at the booth.

1631
02:09:18,925 --> 02:09:20,512
Uday, I'm at Shagun.

1632
02:09:21,078 --> 02:09:22,333
You take the main booth
at Alka talkies.

1633
02:09:22,357 --> 02:09:23,373
Sir...
- You too.

1634
02:09:23,835 --> 02:09:24,859
Sir...

1635
02:09:26,959 --> 02:09:28,792
Do we put an end
to crime or criminals?

1636
02:09:29,971 --> 02:09:32,407
Crime will end,
when criminals stop existing.

1637
02:09:34,268 --> 02:09:36,045
They're beyond repair.

1638
02:09:37,668 --> 02:09:39,995
Today's criminals,
tomorrow's corporators,

1639
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:42,440
MLAs, MPs and ministers.

1640
02:09:43,198 --> 02:09:45,309
We'll have to salute them.

1641
02:09:46,717 --> 02:09:48,966
Would you like that?
- No.

1642
02:09:50,444 --> 02:09:53,834
The mess is cleaning up itself.

1643
02:09:54,511 --> 02:09:55,931
Let it happen.

1644
02:09:57,076 --> 02:10:02,533
So Uday, Alka talkies main booth
needs you more than Rahul does.

1645
02:10:03,249 --> 02:10:05,154
Hail to Lord Ganesha!

1646
02:10:05,911 --> 02:10:06,927
We bow to thee.

1647
02:10:07,453 --> 02:10:10,786
The holy idol...
- We bow to thee.

1648
02:10:11,044 --> 02:10:14,116
Don't shout out everything
that you see on the walky-talky.

1649
02:10:19,416 --> 02:10:20,448
The demon!

1650
02:10:22,443 --> 02:10:24,142
Yes, Rahul.
- Uday, sir.

1651
02:10:25,859 --> 02:10:26,962
I want to give it up.

1652
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:29,418
What?

1653
02:10:30,476 --> 02:10:34,397
I'll confess all my crimes.
Even the murders.

1654
02:10:34,789 --> 02:10:39,282
Please let this demon
become Rahul once again.

1655
02:10:40,925 --> 02:10:43,187
I'll do anything you say.

1656
02:10:43,594 --> 02:10:45,229
I don't want to be here.

1657
02:10:45,413 --> 02:10:48,445
I want to see my parents smiling.
My father won't smile.

1658
02:10:50,197 --> 02:10:52,482
It's a game of destiny.
Let it go on.

1659
02:10:53,493 --> 02:10:56,112
You've made the best decision.
Just listen to me.

1660
02:10:56,479 --> 02:10:58,249
Wait for my call.
Sir!

1661
02:10:59,413 --> 02:11:01,357
Sir!

1662
02:11:59,439 --> 02:12:00,542
Rahul isn't here yet.

1663
02:12:02,410 --> 02:12:03,458
Rahul isn't here?

1664
02:12:13,165 --> 02:12:15,252
Rahul has called.

1665
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:17,754
Hello, Ganya...

1666
02:12:18,039 --> 02:12:19,897
Yes, Rahul.

1667
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:26,381
Can you hear me?
- Yes, I can.

1668
02:12:29,976 --> 02:12:32,206
We've moved on. Can you hear me?

1669
02:12:32,389 --> 02:12:34,259
Have you left?

1670
02:12:36,624 --> 02:12:37,886
Hello, Ganya...

1671
02:12:45,753 --> 02:12:46,864
Get the car ready.

1672
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:52,219
Don't beat him.

1673
02:12:54,675 --> 02:12:56,572
Don't! Please!

1674
02:12:57,749 --> 02:12:59,582
Rahul!

1675
02:14:01,922 --> 02:14:02,978
Manya!

1676
02:14:03,234 --> 02:14:04,829
Why is brother calling me?

1677
02:14:05,554 --> 02:14:06,633
Hop on.

1678
02:14:07,621 --> 02:14:09,969
Does he have your number?
- Yes.

1679
02:14:11,966 --> 02:14:14,624
Daya, he went that way.

1680
02:14:14,746 --> 02:14:16,500
Let's follow him.

1681
02:14:17,972 --> 02:14:18,980
This way.

1682
02:14:40,013 --> 02:14:41,163
He went this way.

1683
02:14:41,497 --> 02:14:42,584
Patience.

1684
02:14:43,785 --> 02:14:46,190
We've been waiting for this.

1685
02:14:47,853 --> 02:14:51,172
Let them shoot each other
and set us free.

1686
02:14:51,452 --> 02:14:52,841
We can save him, sir.

1687
02:14:53,454 --> 02:14:54,629
He wants to give it up.

1688
02:14:55,243 --> 02:14:58,822
Will he give up all of that,
after finding out about Ganya?

1689
02:15:02,774 --> 02:15:04,060
What if he escapes this time?

1690
02:15:04,577 --> 02:15:07,046
Who can save him now?

1691
02:15:07,821 --> 02:15:09,265
I want to see that.

1692
02:15:10,441 --> 02:15:11,687
Look here.

1693
02:16:48,543 --> 02:16:49,583
Brother...

1694
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:52,192
Do you remember the 7/12 extract
owned by 21 people?

1695
02:16:53,206 --> 02:16:54,246
That one?

1696
02:16:57,177 --> 02:16:58,304
I am the twenty-first heir.

1697
02:17:00,077 --> 02:17:01,712
Manohar Dhondiram Kamble.

1698
02:17:13,996 --> 02:17:15,028
Brother,

1699
02:17:16,395 --> 02:17:18,315
you didn't happen
to find the raw material.

1700
02:17:19,509 --> 02:17:20,914
It was planned.

1701
02:17:23,497 --> 02:17:24,862
You took our lands,

1702
02:17:25,674 --> 02:17:27,142
we will take your lives in return.

1703
02:17:50,683 --> 02:17:51,715
Wait.

1704
02:17:52,106 --> 02:17:54,058
He'll get into the car.

1705
02:19:25,622 --> 02:19:27,178
"You'll disturb the crease."

1706
02:19:30,415 --> 02:19:32,431
"Then I'm plastic."

1707
02:19:36,367 --> 02:19:37,430
Plastic!

1708
02:19:41,881 --> 02:19:42,968
Sir...

1709
02:19:43,325 --> 02:19:44,508
May I ask something?

1710
02:19:46,948 --> 02:19:48,027
Where do you belong to?

1711
02:19:49,943 --> 02:19:51,039
Jaateda.

1712
02:19:53,336 --> 02:19:54,519
Taluka Mulshi.

1713
02:20:07,555 --> 02:20:10,372
I don't belong
to the area of criminals.

1714
02:20:25,011 --> 02:20:28,408
Rahul, known as the demon
in the crime circuit

1715
02:20:28,551 --> 02:20:30,551
has been brutally killed.

1716
02:20:31,010 --> 02:20:35,624
A high-drama chase scene was on
for the last half an hour

1717
02:20:35,839 --> 02:20:37,871
before he was shot in the city.

1718
02:20:38,278 --> 02:20:43,198
Finally, it ended in
the vegetable market at Kothrud.

1719
02:20:43,950 --> 02:20:48,164
The matter has once again exposed
the carelessness of the police.

1720
02:21:41,193 --> 02:21:42,391
"Give up crime."

1721
02:21:42,877 --> 02:21:44,464
"I promise, I'll laugh."

1722
02:22:11,789 --> 02:22:15,488
"All the farmers,
who sold their ancestral lands"

1723
02:22:16,073 --> 02:22:17,740
"for peanuts,"

1724
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:21,457
"deserve a slap in the face."
