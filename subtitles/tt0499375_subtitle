1
00:00:48,595 --> 00:00:51,530
Gurukant Desai
salutes the Shakti family.

2
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,470
''Don't dream.''

3
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:18,881
''Dreams never come true.''

4
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:27,026
My father would say.

5
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:33,906
But l dreamt.

6
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,697
l'll work in Turkey
like Ghanshyam Das.

7
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:05,702
Which fool will give you a job?

8
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:11,367
Ghanshyam took him to town for
an interview - he got the job.

9
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:12,977
l got my passport too.

10
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:14,503
Why's this happening behind my back?

11
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:17,545
The school results are
out tomorrow, right?

12
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:21,513
You checked the results in town?

13
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:24,755
You've failed?

14
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:33,526
Trying to cover
the shame with a job?

15
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:37,666
l've a job. How does a
pass or fail matter?

16
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:41,305
l'll skin you. The whole
village will laugh that..

17
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:44,799
..the math teacher's son is
a fool. You'll never prosper.

18
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:47,871
Don't curse. He's going away.

19
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:55,320
Go to hell.
- l can't bear my son failing.

20
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:07,762
My step son is going abroad.

21
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:12,965
Fall at my feet, you foolish monkey.

22
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,671
You witch, your stepson is going
to ride the moon and go far away.

23
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:32,291
Look step-mother. l've
come from ldhar to lstanbul.

24
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,849
You run away too and come here.

25
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:36,987
But you'll be scared when
you see these huge buildings.

26
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:44,629
l'm not scared. Know why? There's
no school, no father, nor his cane.

27
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:51,303
l'm so glad to see you..come.

28
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,318
l wear a uniform. lts Red. And
a cap too. l look good in it.

29
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:01,854
l work very hard.
l sell petrol cans.

30
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:05,585
Do you know what they say for
namaste here? Salaam Walekum.

31
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:23,970
You're amazing.

32
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:34,782
Why are you betting again?
You'll lose double of what you win.

33
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,981
Come, this is not for us.

34
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:42,889
Your luck is incredible.

35
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:57,606
l'll open it..

36
00:05:13,326 --> 00:05:19,492
You shut his shop. How did you know
the red ball was under that glass?

37
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:25,736
My eyes. Out of the three
glasses one was smaller.

38
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,672
l just kept my eyes on that.

39
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:38,650
This is the spice business.
Very big traders come here.

40
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:40,447
lt's a business for the clever.

41
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,988
The sharper you are,
the luckier you are.

42
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,657
From tomorrow there will be a new
trader amongst them.. Gurukant Desai

43
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:05,368
Where's your tie? Take it out.

44
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:06,502
This?

45
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:07,671
- Wear it.

46
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,273
There have been some
complaints against you..

47
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,751
..but he's very
impressed with your work.

48
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,001
You're lucky. He has
made you a sales supervisor.

49
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:39,309
lt took me thirteen years to
become a sales supervisor..

50
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:41,905
..just keep that tie on.

51
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:49,446
l don't want to wear a tie.
Nor do l want this promotion.

52
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:50,648
Why?

53
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,449
l want to return to my village.

54
00:11:56,662 --> 00:12:00,428
When did this foolish idea
occur to you, may l ask?

55
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:02,795
After wearing the tie.

56
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,328
Why?

57
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:12,271
You like my work, so
does he, then why should..

58
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:17,271
..l work for that white man?
l'll work for myself.

59
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:22,345
Take it in writing,
you'll never succeed.

60
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:27,291
My destiny is already written.

61
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,306
l'll always remember you.

62
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,881
You're taking all the fun with you.

63
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:55,446
Now we'll just slog here.

64
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:37,605
Baapu, l'm leaving.

65
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,807
The country's become free
so why not your daughter?

66
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:47,649
l've found my partner.
Please wish for my happiness.

67
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,846
Sujata.

68
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:56,879
A bearded man left
this letter for you.

69
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:10,300
l don't have the courage
to run away and lead a life.

70
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:12,702
Please forgive me, Sujata.

71
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:15,936
Yours, Bhanu Patel.

72
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,925
You're spread like a
python on the whole berth.

73
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,852
l have a reservation.

74
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:17,632
Reservation is only for the night.

75
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:26,434
Look out. lt's still night.

76
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:38,882
ln many places in
the world it's morning.

77
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:41,816
Can't think beyond the village.

78
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:31,910
Throw it when the train
stops. lt won't fly back.

79
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:34,437
Oh god, l can't even cry in peace.

80
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:46,391
Good, you woke me.
My station's come.

81
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:12,416
Girl - Alone? Boarded
at the last Station?

82
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:13,542
Yes.

83
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:16,918
This bogey, row thirty two. She
drenched the whole seat crying.

84
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:45,475
Where did you go and die,
all these days stepson?

85
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,315
l was saving myself from
your beatings, you witch.

86
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,585
Guru has become an Englishman.

87
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:54,717
Come.

88
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:56,658
Sit. Sit.

89
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:02,264
Come Ramlal, look who's come.

90
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:04,495
Guru? l didn't recognize you.

91
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,936
How would you?
- you can't see after your marriage.

92
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:12,273
Has your wife come? Guru
give him some money---

93
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:17,876
Miser. Give him twenty.

94
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:29,417
Look how big the school has grown.

95
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,706
Must have received ten
twenty lakh canings.

96
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:46,004
And look at the
progress you've made!

97
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,313
lf l'd known earlier,
l would have hit..

98
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,438
..you till you
became the Prime Minister.

99
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:56,781
For me?

100
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:03,624
Wonderful!

101
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:06,956
How many days have you taken off?

102
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,268
As many as l want.
- What do you mean?

103
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:13,702
Meaning, l've left the job.

104
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:16,403
But your brother said that they've

105
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:18,375
promoted you and
tripled your salary.

106
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:23,346
Yes. - but l've worked
enough for the white man..

107
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:29,420
l want to do business.

108
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:37,285
What do you know about business?
When i did business..

109
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:38,829
..l could hardly put
food on the table.

110
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:44,665
Just because you failed,
doesn't mean l won't pass.

111
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,609
Keep it. lt'll help you
keep track of the bad time.

112
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:56,047
Return his money.

113
00:23:57,816 --> 00:24:00,876
lf you setup your home, with his
money your wife will run away.

114
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:07,854
Go do business.

115
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:45,557
Do you remember how we would run up?

116
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:47,292
Carrying huge tins, bhajiya in one...

117
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:49,891
..Kachori in the other!

118
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:52,027
Bastard, you've been selling
something or the other since childhood.

119
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:57,307
Three paise profit for one bhajia...

120
00:24:57,342 --> 00:24:59,810
..and the
bhajiya's weren't even hot.

121
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:01,242
After climbing all
these stairs we should..

122
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:03,781
..at least make
half a paise profit..

123
00:25:07,586 --> 00:25:08,951
Bhaji!

124
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:10,818
Kachori!

125
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:18,855
Bapu will never agree..
he is a money lender..

126
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:20,558
King of misers!

127
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:26,927
l've fifteen thousand.
l need another fifteen.

128
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:31,570
He won't invest. He's saved
it for my sister's wedding.

129
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:35,280
Dowry?
- Yes.

130
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:36,473
How much?

131
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,544
Twenty five thousand.

132
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:43,013
l'll marry her.

133
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:45,516
What?

134
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:48,791
Marry her to me.

135
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:54,890
She is elder to us by a year.

136
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:59,031
One, two years is no big deal.

137
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:02,865
Don't talk without thinking.

138
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:04,833
Look, all l know is that

139
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:06,242
l'm ready to marry her.

140
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:07,575
Then we'll be business partners.

141
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:08,772
Fifty-fifty.

142
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:14,308
You will receive a dowry
and make me an equal partner?

143
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:17,652
You'll also be part of the dowry.

144
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:24,886
How do l tell bapu?

145
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:27,798
l won't be able to.

146
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:34,601
l'm marrying, not stealing.
- l'll talk to him.

147
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:19,982
Have you come to talk about
marriage? Are you a broker?

148
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:21,451
We aren't interested .

149
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:27,258
The last time l saw you.. you
were crying yourself hoarse.

150
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:30,386
l don't even know you. Why
would l cry in front of you?

151
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:33,262
You were crying in front of
the whole world on the train..

152
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:35,596
..reading some bhanu Patel's letter.

153
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:36,861
Who are you?

154
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:39,426
Guru, who knows everything.

155
00:27:40,305 --> 00:27:44,264
My leg broke, it still hurts.

156
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:48,009
Then go to a doctor.
What are you here for?

157
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:52,613
l am here to talk about my marriage.

158
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:58,782
Don't drag me into this.

159
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:07,560
Where is Kaka?

160
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,332
Do you recognize me?

161
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:22,572
No.

162
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:29,810
You shut down my father's ghee shop
- you even took away all the buffaloes.

163
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:36,250
You're the boy who
hit me on my ear..

164
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:37,761
..with a stick and ran away.

165
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:41,757
l was eight years old.

166
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,394
You've come to make me
deaf in my other ear?

167
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,973
Kantilal
- He has no business sense.

168
00:28:54,346 --> 00:29:02,412
Now thanks to me, he is the
headmaster You are in Turkey, right?

169
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:06,685
No, l'm here. l want to do
business here with your son Jignesh.

170
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:08,586
What business?

171
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:12,354
Many new things are available there.

172
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:15,832
l'll bring them and sell them
here. l'll make good profit.

173
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:19,736
And what does your father say?

174
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,230
He says l'll be ruined.

175
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:25,742
Then you will
definitely make a profit.

176
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:30,404
But l've stopped
lending money these days.

177
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:32,245
l've to get my daughter married.

178
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:37,983
l'll marry her and
take good care of her.

179
00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:41,884
l'll become a big man in five years.

180
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:48,394
My daughter is crazy.

181
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:54,003
Haven't you heard what those
bastard villagers are saying?

182
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:59,972
Jobless people keep
wagging their tongues.

183
00:30:02,948 --> 00:30:10,912
There was a sickly looking youngster,
with a red flag and four labourers

184
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:18,452
She wanted to marry him- have you heard
this at least or are you deaf too?

185
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:26,866
l was on the same
train as her that night.

186
00:30:27,906 --> 00:30:29,635
l've seen a bit of the world.

187
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:32,404
l know right from wrong.

188
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:40,317
Just give me your blessing
and l'll take care of the girl.

189
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:51,655
l'll take your leave.

190
00:31:54,526 --> 00:32:00,328
You're leaving with your
brother in law after marriage?

191
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:01,592
Where did your wife go?

192
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,566
Don't scream. She's not coming.

193
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:05,000
Why not?
- Let it be.

194
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,800
What catastrophe
is keeping her here?

195
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:11,275
Don't know. Maybe
she doesn't like me.

196
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:14,403
How can she not like you?
The witch is mad.

197
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:17,577
Not all women are sweet like you. .

198
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:22,482
Come on, bless me.

199
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:48,739
l know it'snt your wish
- but Can't you bless me?

200
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:51,747
May god give you sense..

201
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:41,356
Don't go.

202
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:44,426
What?

203
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:48,805
What if l die here all alone?

204
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:54,642
But you said you
didn't want to come.

205
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:58,006
You could have asked me again.

206
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,778
Look, you're not asking me even now.

207
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,822
But you don't even have any luggage?

208
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:18,268
Can't you buy me four sarees?

209
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:21,667
And ticket?

210
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:23,797
Do l need a ticket
to sit on your lap?

211
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:29,908
Come.

212
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:34,267
Where is the Yarn market?
- This way.

213
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:51,455
Where does all the buying and
selling happen? - Upstairs sir.

214
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,775
Why do they shout so much?
How will we do business here?

215
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:14,977
You'll see. When we
shout everyone'll shut up.

216
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:19,650
Mathura Das?

217
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:29,323
Could be. Why?

218
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:32,600
l've come from ldhar
village in Gujarat.

219
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,967
l want to do yarn
business with my own money.

220
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:35,472
Wherever l go people
say that there's a union.

221
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:36,599
Yes.

222
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,437
You have to be a member.

223
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,944
Your bid's too high. You'll
get it much cheaper in Salem.

224
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:50,920
Quiet. Don't teach me business. lf
you want to trade become a member.

225
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:52,286
So make me a member.

226
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:55,622
There's a five year waiting
period., Don't waste your time.

227
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:59,754
You're not letting me do business
nor are you making me a member.

228
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:06,361
Don't chew my head. Arzaan Contractor
is the president of the union.

229
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:13,240
You can become a member only with
his letter. You won't become a member.

230
00:37:13,545 --> 00:37:15,240
Are you a fortune teller?

231
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:21,377
Twenty five thousand
like you come here everyday.

232
00:37:21,452 --> 00:37:23,886
You'll never make it. G? away.

233
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:34,525
l'll stand right next
to you and do business.

234
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,762
And l'll wipe out twenty
five thousand like you.

235
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:55,343
What do you want?

236
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:59,886
Your letter. l want to
trade in the cloth market.

237
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:04,753
Come to the office.

l play, but not this.

242
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:22,745
Play.

243
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:30,981
lf this ball goes into that
hole you'll get your letter'

..and you will give me the letter?

246
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,787
Of course.

247
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,760
For sure right, if l do it?

248
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:45,333
Try it.

249
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:57,609
What's your name?

250
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:01,213
You'll give me the letter?

251
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:02,513
Ok. l'll see.

252
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:06,347
l've collected money for
business with great difficulty.

253
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:07,721
l'll take care.

254
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:12,228
ln my village, help
is never forgotten.

255
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:15,288
lt'll happen. lf
you don't mind. Yeah?

256
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:19,496
Thank you sir. You'll see,
business will benefit with me.

257
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:30,576
Let me get the change!
What's the hurry?

258
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:31,943
l've got something.

259
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:33,544
For me?
- Yes.

260
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:35,381
What?

261
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,685
What have you bought for me?

262
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:48,626
This?

263
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:51,528
Don't you like it?

264
00:39:52,603 --> 00:39:59,304
l thought you'll get me lots of saris,
jewelery, diamonds, 8-10 big cars.

265
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:01,572
l have brought it all.

266
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:05,340
You'll see.

267
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:09,779
Can you see?

268
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:13,789
No, but the whole world will see us.

269
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:22,564
l can see it.. a
big house.. a palace

270
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:29,300
l can see brinjals..
totally burnt. No food tonight.

271
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:38,544
l see a factory.. very big.
Even bigger than Burma Shell.

00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:42,318
l see clothes in the wash.. wet..

273
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:45,378
..you'll have to go in
your underwear tomorrow.

00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,399
l'll never be fat.

277
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:06,268
Ok slim one! Wearing
nau lakha necklace..

278
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,279
..fat bangles..
walking with a swagger.

279
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:10,405
Happy.

280
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,614
Very very very happy.

281
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:17,714
With you.

282
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:23,759
The brother-in-law is here.

283
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:28,822
lt's all over.

284
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,300
What?
- Our business.

285
00:41:32,436 --> 00:41:33,926
But what happened?

286
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:39,343
Contractor's
rejected our application.

287
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:42,306
Can't be. He gave me his word.

288
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,316
l'm coming from his office.
He tore up our application.

289
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:49,313
So do we go back to the village now?

290
00:41:50,855 --> 00:41:52,686
lf we don't, we'll
be out on the streets.

291
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,009
Who are you?

292
00:42:21,485 --> 00:42:22,816
Who are you?

293
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:24,345
l live here.

294
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:26,618
l don't live here, okay?

295
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:28,950
Then why are you
staring at my building?

296
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:33,558
Why? Do l need a
letter even to look now?

297
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:37,294
The building is on the road,
the road is the Government's..

298
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:38,995
..these eyes are mine..
the country is free.

299
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:43,302
l can stare at whoever,
whenever l want. Don't bug me.

300
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:44,808
Go watch your dog piss.

301
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:52,610
Very good.. anger early in the
morning is very good. Let's walk

302
00:42:53,317 --> 00:42:55,376
What's your name?

303
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:59,322
You've turned your
city into a club..

304
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,757
..you've to wear a
suit and talk in English

305
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:05,318
They've turned Bombay into a dog..

306
00:43:06,864 --> 00:43:12,325
Good. Being angry with
Bombay is very good.

307
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:17,306
l am angry with one man..
l want to slap him..

308
00:43:21,946 --> 00:43:24,278
He promised me a letter..

309
00:43:24,348 --> 00:43:27,283
..four months ago and
then tore up my application.

310
00:43:28,352 --> 00:43:31,583
He doesn't wake up before ten
o'clock, how will you slap him?

311
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:33,653
Do you know him?

312
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:35,316
Since he was this little.

313
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:37,725
Can you do something for me?

314
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:40,660
l don't believe in giving
or taking recommendations.

315
00:43:41,365 --> 00:43:45,665
But you look like a big
social communist leader.

316
00:43:45,736 --> 00:43:49,035
You should help the poor.

317
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,739
And if l say no?

318
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:54,938
That's a problem. l
can't hear the word no.

319
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:00,373
Come to my office tomorrow.

320
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:04,377
Will you get the letter for me?

321
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:07,318
l'll make sure your voice is heard.

322
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:09,416
How?

323
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:11,427
l own a
newspaper Swatantra Samachar.

324
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:14,589
lf you're speaking the truth then..

325
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:16,257
l will fight your war..

326
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:18,802
..but if you've lied l'll slap you.

327
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:22,703
l've just arrived in Bombay,
l haven't learnt to lie yet.

328
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,502
Good, come tomorrow.

329
00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:38,282
Trading's big shot Arzan Contractor..
The country is free but..

330
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:44,625
..when will the trade markets
be free from Arzan Contractor?

331
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:49,299
Mr. Contractor considers himself
the undisputed lord of the union..

332
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:54,634
..and Mr. Gurukant Desai his enemy.

333
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,407
..now nobody can stop Guru
from becoming a businessman.

334
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:02,370
A very big businessman.

335
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:06,644
Bigger than anybody..
am l talking too big?

336
00:45:08,252 --> 00:45:10,652
A bit.

337
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:20,922
Here l am, right beside you.

338
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:30,296
But you won't last - There
are a dime a dozen like you..

339
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:39,442
There's just one person
like me here - only Guru.

340
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:03,638
l didn't know you had so
many complaints against me.

341
00:46:04,842 --> 00:46:10,974
You should have talked to me
- not the papers.

342
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:13,715
lt's difficult to meet you.

343
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:16,252
Today you're in
trouble so you've come here..

344
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,378
..or you go only to the club.

345
00:46:20,324 --> 00:46:25,489
lt seems like this trading
association doesn't require me.

346
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,991
l am resigning.

347
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:32,597
No.

348
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,501
Let him go, someone
else will come along.

349
00:46:34,605 --> 00:46:37,369
Quiet. You needn't go sir.

350
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:40,672
He's decided.

351
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:44,737
Now even God can't make him
change his decision, isn't it?

352
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:50,013
My decision won't
change but times will.

353
00:46:50,354 --> 00:46:55,951
Anything could happen tomorrow..
don't come crying to me.

354
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:02,759
lf we're going to be that scared,
how'll we do business?

355
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:08,431
Don't worry.. we are the fearless.

356
00:47:11,275 --> 00:47:12,333
What was your name again?

357
00:47:12,843 --> 00:47:19,976
Not 'was', it still is..
and will always be..

358
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:40,394
Where is that villager Guru?

359
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:48,678
You opened a new
office without calling me?

360
00:47:48,746 --> 00:47:51,271
Meenu, what do we do with him..

361
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:54,340
wring his neck or break his teeth?

362
00:47:55,753 --> 00:47:57,015
l'll do it.

363
00:47:57,087 --> 00:47:58,679
Which tooth?

364
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,279
This one.

365
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:02,350
My name is Meenakshi.

366
00:48:02,426 --> 00:48:06,863
Jalkukdi.. Meenu. No.
- Yes. - No.

367
00:48:06,931 --> 00:48:09,297
She won't accept defeat.

368
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:12,733
lt's too small a place for you..

369
00:48:16,273 --> 00:48:19,333
That he doesn't have faith in
himself and has to depend on God.

370
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:20,842
He was right.

371
00:48:21,779 --> 00:48:25,374
No. God and l don't get along.

372
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:27,974
lf you offer it as a
sweet l'll eat it.

373
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,310
You'll get both or neither.

374
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:33,386
She's smarter than you.

375
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:37,260
Why don't you treat the
prasad as a sweet and..

376
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:39,319
l'll treat the tilak as just colour.

377
00:48:39,396 --> 00:48:41,591
You've to have your way.

378
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:46,792
Such a struggle for a tiny sweet!

379
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:48,565
Who is this villager?

380
00:48:49,306 --> 00:48:50,568
My brother-in-law and partner.

381
00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:51,800
What business?

382
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:53,467
Cotton.
- Polyester.

383
00:48:55,346 --> 00:48:58,474
Very good.. a fight
on the very first day.

384
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:19,360
My brother is sleeping outside.

385
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:22,669
l am not asking you to wake him.

386
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:17,952
What will you do now?

387
00:50:19,363 --> 00:50:20,557
What do you think?

388
00:50:21,632 --> 00:50:25,295
You beast.. you brought us
here like a big leader..

389
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:26,961
..how are you going to

390
00:50:27,037 --> 00:50:28,834
clothe and feed us?

391
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:33,401
Polyester.

392
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:35,470
What's that?

393
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:48,548
Soft, shiny, naughty just like you.

394
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:51,924
l made a big mistake marrying you.

395
00:50:52,996 --> 00:50:54,327
l can't understand whether you

396
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:57,856
love your yarn more or me.

397
00:51:00,337 --> 00:51:01,304
Should l tell you?

398
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:09,341
Das was saying polyester
business's dangerous - Let him.

399
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:12,678
Are you brainless? The whole
world is into cotton and you..

400
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,284
When you see the profit..

401
00:51:15,352 --> 00:51:17,411
..you'll say wow Guru,
how intelligent you are!

402
00:51:18,355 --> 00:51:19,481
How much did you invest?

403
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:20,682
All the money.

404
00:51:20,758 --> 00:51:22,487
Oh God, you'll kill us.

405
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,852
We'll think about
that when we get killed.

406
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,637
What happened? - They've
shut down the market. - Why?

407
00:51:38,709 --> 00:51:40,301
They say it's gambling.

408
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:43,643
Gambling?

409
00:51:43,714 --> 00:51:46,308
But the fun of business is
predicting which price will rise..

410
00:51:46,383 --> 00:51:49,318
..and fall, where the
losses and profits are..

411
00:51:49,386 --> 00:51:50,444
.that shows the
acumen of the businessman.

412
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:52,386
The Government calls that gambling.

413
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:57,326
Then tell the
Government to stop lotteries..

414
00:51:57,394 --> 00:52:00,659
..Mahalaxmi horse races and
astrology. All that's gambling too.

415
00:52:00,731 --> 00:52:02,892
You came and ruined everyone.

416
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:04,928
Not me.

417
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:07,599
Your friend Contractor has
bribed officials to shut it down.

418
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:10,671
No problem.

419
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:14,473
Let's do our businesses from here.

420
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:16,274
What are you doing?
You'll go to jail and..

421
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:17,574
..send everybody else in as well.

422
00:52:18,816 --> 00:52:26,348
This is a Government
notice from an l.A.S. officer..

423
00:52:26,423 --> 00:52:28,015
lt's the law now.

424
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:29,285
lf a law can be made in a day..

425
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,623
..then it can also
be changed in a day

426
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:38,533
K.R. Menon is very strict.
We are ruined.

427
00:52:50,914 --> 00:52:56,716
Come.. this way.

428
00:52:57,387 --> 00:53:00,049
Mr. K.R. Menon?

429
00:53:00,123 --> 00:53:01,317
Who are you?

430
00:53:01,391 --> 00:53:04,588
So you stopped the trading?
- What are these?

431
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:07,323
The notice at the trading
hall has your signature. Right?

432
00:53:07,397 --> 00:53:13,700
Unni ask him to stop.
- Come in

433
00:53:13,804 --> 00:53:15,999
Stop.

434
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:19,264
All the goods are yours.

435
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:20,833
What nonsense. Who are you?

436
00:53:21,345 --> 00:53:23,279
My father in law is a moneylender..

437
00:53:23,347 --> 00:53:25,281
..people who borrowed
money from him and..

438
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:27,749
..couldn't pay back left
their belongings in his custody.

439
00:53:27,818 --> 00:53:30,616
lf a ghee shop was shut down
then he would keep the buffaloes..

440
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:32,279
l had a polyester shop and..

441
00:53:32,356 --> 00:53:34,881
..you shut it down so
now all this is yours.

442
00:53:36,894 --> 00:53:41,297
Top quality polyester.
Make clothes for the children.

443
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,707
Gurukant Desai.

444
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:07,313
Menon saab namaste.

445
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:09,986
l've been looking
for you for four days.

446
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:13,262
You should have left your address.

447
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:17,859
Mr. Menon, A very
big l.A.S. officer.

448
00:54:18,335 --> 00:54:21,270
Look, my record is impeccable..

449
00:54:21,305 --> 00:54:23,273
..if the higher
authorities find out about the..

450
00:54:23,307 --> 00:54:25,969
..polyester, l will lose my job.

451
00:54:26,076 --> 00:54:27,668
What can l do about that sir?

452
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:31,009
Take it all back,
neighbours have begun to talk.

453
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:34,812
But until the market opens l
can't take the goods back.

454
00:54:34,885 --> 00:54:36,477
Are you threatening me?

455
00:54:36,553 --> 00:54:38,282
No sir, but the other traders were..

456
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:40,653
..also going to come to your
house to leave their goods..

457
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:44,751
How can l re-open the market?

458
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:47,888
l'm an illiterate villager,
l don't know much..

459
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:50,299
But if you locked the market doors..

460
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,595
..then you must have the keys.

461
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:53,465
And if l say no?

462
00:54:53,537 --> 00:54:54,595
What?

463
00:54:54,638 --> 00:54:56,697
And if l say no?

464
00:54:57,341 --> 00:54:59,434
l don't understand the word 'no'.

465
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:05,839
And one more thing, should l
give your address to the traders?

466
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:38,876
Good show.

467
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:52,924
Guruji has come. He has
brought gifts for all.

468
00:55:52,996 --> 00:55:57,433
What have you brought for me?

469
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:04,466
You forgot the jalkukdi?

470
00:56:06,276 --> 00:56:07,368
Close your eyes.

471
00:56:23,593 --> 00:56:24,855
Now open them.

472
00:56:25,328 --> 00:56:28,320
A wedding sari!

473
00:56:28,398 --> 00:56:29,865
You'll marry me?

474
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:31,264
For seven lifetimes..

475
00:56:31,334 --> 00:56:34,861
Very nice.

476
00:56:35,305 --> 00:56:37,296
l'll show it to everyone.

477
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:40,502
So Gurubhai?

478
00:56:41,344 --> 00:56:42,743
Why are you calling me Gurubhai?

479
00:56:42,813 --> 00:56:44,007
l'm like your son.

480
00:56:44,347 --> 00:56:47,612
The name suits you.

481
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:54,646
Come on, get up.

482
00:56:58,628 --> 00:56:59,788
l know you're not even

483
00:56:59,863 --> 00:57:01,228
going to touch this..

484
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:05,291
..you look like
Gandhiji in this dhoti.

485
00:57:05,368 --> 00:57:09,236
But when you travel abroad..

486
00:57:09,272 --> 00:57:13,231
..and it's very cold you can make
a coat like Nehru's and wear it..

487
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:15,904
..lt'll look very nice.

488
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:21,878
Are you bribing me throwing
Gandhiji and Nehru's names in?

489
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:31,694
No. l don't know how to shake
hands and say thank you in English.

490
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:34,263
lf you don't like it..

491
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:36,663
..then break both my
neck and teeth. Okay?

492
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:40,260
This is what l like about you..

493
00:57:40,303 --> 00:57:44,672
..suddenly you speak with
honesty and intelligence.

494
00:57:45,575 --> 00:57:47,270
Don't ever let go of this habit.

495
00:57:49,279 --> 00:57:56,014
Whatever happens, l'll
never let go of you. l promise.

496
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:11,287
Finish it in one gulp.

497
00:59:13,296 --> 00:59:16,857
He won't drink, his
wife will scream at him.

498
00:59:18,768 --> 00:59:23,262
All wives scold.. if you
drink a bit, you'll hear less.

499
00:59:26,543 --> 00:59:29,410
l apologize for being late.

500
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:33,245
l was doing our trial balance..

501
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:36,444
..our profits are up
by 300% in six months.

502
00:59:39,456 --> 00:59:42,391
And the price of polyester
has gone through the roof!

503
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:48,253
But don't relax, because if
we've worked 18 hours till today..

504
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:52,324
..we will now work 25 hours per day.

505
00:59:52,402 --> 00:59:54,802
Ask why?

506
00:59:55,805 --> 00:59:59,263
Because, the Shakti
family will not only trade..

507
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:02,278
..we will make kela silk.
We are opening a factory.

508
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:06,280
Foreign machines will produce the..

509
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:10,683
..English named
kela silk.. polyester.

510
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:13,288
Just because you've
bought a car doesn't mean..

511
01:00:13,356 --> 01:00:14,755
..that you dream of
opening a factory.

512
01:00:14,824 --> 01:00:20,626
Shut up! Unless you dream
you'll be stuck to ldhar.. drink..

513
01:00:20,697 --> 01:00:23,359
We've also seen the land. 25
acres right next to your village.

514
01:00:24,901 --> 01:00:27,301
Walk carefully.. don't
be in such a hurry..

515
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:30,305
Who wants to walk? l want to run..

516
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:34,003
l'm carrying you in my
arms, so don't fall.

517
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:35,505
And the money?

518
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:38,741
Are you Contractor, that the
banks will give you a loan?

519
01:00:38,815 --> 01:00:41,306
To hell with Contractor and banks..

520
01:00:41,384 --> 01:00:44,319
..we will go to the public..
give ten rupees..

521
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:48,323
..and become the owner..
public issue..

522
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:53,624
..if the factory earns,
so will everyone.

523
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:55,927
Permission for the public
issue will come in one month.

524
01:00:55,999 --> 01:01:00,402
Fantastic! Let's have
another one on this!

525
01:01:01,304 --> 01:01:05,263
You didn't ask me..

526
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:07,276
..you could've at
least taken my opinion.

527
01:01:12,816 --> 01:01:18,413
You wouldn't have let us sell
polyester, or anything else.

528
01:01:20,357 --> 01:01:22,757
You were about to pack up
and go back to the village.

529
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,294
We are partners..

530
01:01:25,362 --> 01:01:27,421
..it's not just you.

531
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,634
You just stay behind me..
and watch the world.

532
01:01:35,705 --> 01:01:40,301
lf you stick your nose in,
l'll turn you into polyester..

533
01:01:40,377 --> 01:01:44,677
..and sell you to a foreign lady.

534
01:01:55,892 --> 01:01:59,328
Little prince is upset.. no problem.

535
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:02,263
l'll pacify him and bring him back..

536
01:02:02,332 --> 01:02:05,995
..but empty the bottle. Understood?

537
01:02:09,773 --> 01:02:11,866
Where are you going?
- Station.

538
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:15,438
Come back. Everyone's watching

539
01:02:15,512 --> 01:02:16,638
l can't get along with him.

540
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:21,514
This is not a silly game
that you get upset and leave.

541
01:02:21,584 --> 01:02:25,782
Come back.. should
l fall at your feet?

542
01:02:27,357 --> 01:02:28,585
l'm going to the village.

543
01:02:28,658 --> 01:02:33,721
We'll all go together . and put
up a huge board-Shakti factory

544
01:02:34,898 --> 01:02:36,763
l don't want any of this.

545
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:41,428
People will say that
you're jealous of him.

546
01:02:41,504 --> 01:02:43,301
Who will say?
- Even l will..

547
01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:44,806
You've gone mad and blind.

548
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:47,309
Your problem is with me..

549
01:02:47,377 --> 01:02:51,006
..speak properly to your sister.

550
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:54,316
You're senseless. You've forgotten..

551
01:02:54,384 --> 01:02:57,581
..that he's looked after
both of us.. understand him.

552
01:02:57,654 --> 01:03:01,647
He only understands money. Do
you know why he married you?

553
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:05,658
He was a true friend. He
married a girl who was eloping.

554
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:07,992
He would have married you
even if you were handicapped.

555
01:03:08,064 --> 01:03:10,589
You know why? Tell her..

556
01:03:12,602 --> 01:03:14,297
You are talking like a child.

557
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:15,894
He married you for dowry.

558
01:03:16,873 --> 01:03:18,397
Tell him not to lie.

559
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:20,776
Ask him..

560
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:28,283
Father had promised a
big dowry, 25 thousand..

561
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:30,649
..he wanted to start his business.

562
01:03:31,788 --> 01:03:33,585
Tell him not to lie..

563
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:37,353
You're just capital.

564
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:45,561
He's lying, isn't he?

565
01:03:52,342 --> 01:03:53,604
ls this true?

566
01:09:13,563 --> 01:09:16,532
Fight with the whole world,
but not with me.

567
01:09:19,635 --> 01:09:22,229
lf you're with me, l
can beat the whole world.

568
01:09:29,245 --> 01:09:31,907
Then why are you stuck
to my neck? Come on..

569
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,644
Where?

570
01:09:39,255 --> 01:09:40,381
To beat the world.

571
01:09:50,867 --> 01:09:52,528
You've come?

572
01:09:54,871 --> 01:09:59,399
On time.

573
01:11:05,374 --> 01:11:07,808
How was the Europe and America tour?

574
01:11:07,877 --> 01:11:11,278
Very successful..
only one difficulty..

575
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:14,282
..l didn't get to eat
her cooking. l starved.

576
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:17,342
You're being called 'the
business king of lndia.'

577
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:18,478
Do you have Shakti shares?

578
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:19,612
- Yes.

579
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:21,020
Then you are lndia's
business king too.

580
01:11:22,358 --> 01:11:23,620
People are pointing fingers

581
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:25,024
at your growth.

582
01:11:25,094 --> 01:11:26,459
You're growing too fast.

583
01:11:27,697 --> 01:11:31,690
This is a race. And l run
to win, not for pleasure.

584
01:11:33,903 --> 01:11:38,397
Whatever you own is mine.
Now tell me, will you marry me?

585
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:40,441
No.
- Hey Jalkukdi..

586
01:11:41,377 --> 01:11:45,040
You look beautiful,
just like a bride.

587
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:46,945
Really? Actually l knew.

588
01:11:47,016 --> 01:11:49,610
That's why this Parsi
uncle's been troubling me.

589
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:52,320
l told him move on,
my husband's coming.

590
01:11:54,457 --> 01:11:55,822
So when are you marrying me?

591
01:11:56,392 --> 01:11:58,826
Leave Didi.. let's get
into my car and run away.

592
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:00,054
Can you cook like her?

593
01:12:01,464 --> 01:12:03,261
l'm talking love and you're
talking about your stomach..

594
01:12:03,332 --> 01:12:05,391
..how do you live with him?

595
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:08,962
With great difficulty.
Where's Nanaji?

596
01:12:09,005 --> 01:12:10,973
America.. he's back in two weeks

597
01:12:11,073 --> 01:12:13,940
Gurubhai! Namaste bhabhi

598
01:12:14,343 --> 01:12:16,743
Someone's been wanting to meet you.

599
01:12:19,682 --> 01:12:22,344
How many months?

600
01:12:23,352 --> 01:12:26,617
How did you know.. l
haven't even told the beast.

601
01:12:26,689 --> 01:12:30,750
You glow.. it's a
girl, just like me.

602
01:12:33,362 --> 01:12:36,923
Dad. Gurukant Desai.

603
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:40,426
So you're Gurubhai.

604
01:12:40,503 --> 01:12:45,497
And you're the senior Mr.
Contractor.. pleasure.

605
01:12:46,342 --> 01:12:49,311
l've a present for you..

606
01:12:49,378 --> 01:12:51,608
..that's why l wanted
you to come to the wedding.

607
01:12:51,681 --> 01:12:55,310
But l brought a present only
for your daughter.. not for you.

608
01:12:57,386 --> 01:13:02,881
A blank cheque. Your
math is very good.

609
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:08,626
So fill it up.. with any number .

610
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:11,799
Everything has a price.

611
01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:16,264
Where you've reached today
on your own, is amazing.

612
01:13:16,305 --> 01:13:19,297
But the path ends here.

613
01:13:46,902 --> 01:13:54,365
Don't put it down. You might
not get another opportunity.

614
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:16,662
Who is it?
- Bloody old man.

615
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:19,562
He wants to buy me.

616
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:24,569
He is putting a price tag on me?

617
01:14:26,308 --> 01:14:29,971
What he made in 150
years l made in 10 years.

618
01:14:31,347 --> 01:14:33,281
ls it the same?
- no.

619
01:14:37,686 --> 01:14:45,422
Get all our friends
from the press right now.

620
01:14:45,494 --> 01:14:49,430
Call them.. go to
their homes.. wake them.

621
01:14:50,633 --> 01:14:54,000
All the newspapers from
tomorrow should expose Contractor.

622
01:14:55,337 --> 01:15:00,297
Tell them.. that
Contractor's suits..

623
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:11,111
The word Contractor
should become a curse.

624
01:16:15,985 --> 01:16:20,046
This is the Swatantra Samchar..
the lndependent.

625
01:16:21,523 --> 01:16:26,290
This newspaper has driven
the British away fearlessly.

626
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:31,490
lt has fought with
ideals and principles.

627
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:37,632
l was away for a month
and you all sold it.

628
01:16:39,241 --> 01:16:46,147
ln a month you've dressed the
newspaper in Guru's safari suits.

629
01:16:50,686 --> 01:16:53,484
Who gave you this?

630
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:57,447
Guru? Remove it.

631
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:15,369
Throw it in the dustbin.

632
01:17:20,115 --> 01:17:23,482
Editor sir, l hear you've a new car.

633
01:17:25,955 --> 01:17:30,016
Shame on you!

634
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:34,896
We have to apologize to the country.

635
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:40,300
Tomorrow's edition will
have an apology letter.

636
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:43,600
The page has already been composed.
- Then stop it!

637
01:17:44,974 --> 01:17:50,935
You've made false allegations,
so you have to apologize.

638
01:17:57,987 --> 01:17:59,579
And send for Shyam Saxena.

639
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:03,315
Have you gone deaf? Shyam Saxena.

640
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:05,519
Ask him and Guru to come.

641
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:21,103
This ladoo has come
specially for you from Junagad.

642
01:18:22,511 --> 01:18:25,105
What's wrong? You look troubled.
Can l do something?

643
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:27,039
You can do anything right?

644
01:18:27,116 --> 01:18:28,174
- Yes.

645
01:18:28,984 --> 01:18:30,451
Nothing is difficult for you.

646
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,216
You just keep throwing
your money everywhere.

647
01:18:36,525 --> 01:18:39,961
There are.. are all kinds of people.

648
01:18:40,029 --> 01:18:45,399
And everyone has a price.
Right brother?

649
01:18:45,968 --> 01:18:48,198
That's why l carry two
kinds of slippers with me.

650
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:50,602
One made of silver and one of gold.

651
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:59,576
And which slipper for me?

652
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:09,284
Khadi.

653
01:19:12,194 --> 01:19:14,094
But you will hit me
with a slipper too.

654
01:19:15,931 --> 01:19:21,335
Shyam, What do you
think of Gurubhai?

655
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,168
What can l say?

656
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:29,172
Feel free?.

657
01:19:33,248 --> 01:19:37,048
Gurubhai is the biggest
hope of the lndian industry.

658
01:19:37,953 --> 01:19:39,648
A champion businessman.

659
01:19:40,956 --> 01:19:43,151
l am not asking you
for an advertisement.

660
01:19:43,959 --> 01:19:45,517
Speak honestly.

661
01:19:46,228 --> 01:19:50,892
He is a disease who
should be locked up in jail..

662
01:19:50,966 --> 01:19:55,528
..and the keys thrown away.

663
01:19:59,708 --> 01:20:02,336
Who is this great man
who is praising me so much?

664
01:20:02,411 --> 01:20:04,538
And why do you feel this way?

665
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:08,676
His growth rate is 400%.

666
01:20:09,685 --> 01:20:15,180
But corruption and greed have grown at
double that rate thanks to his bribes.

667
01:20:19,995 --> 01:20:22,054
Have you called me to
beat me with a stick?

668
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:26,296
l've not even started.

669
01:20:32,474 --> 01:20:36,103
lf you and l break the
law we would be scared.

670
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:40,507
But he is proud of it.

671
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:45,986
And he doesn't just
break or bend the law..

672
01:20:46,021 --> 01:20:49,980
..he buries it and then
builds a beautiful park on it..

673
01:20:50,025 --> 01:20:55,019
..so that people forget his theft.

674
01:20:55,097 --> 01:20:57,588
Nanaji..

675
01:21:02,504 --> 01:21:05,234
lf you want to tell me
something just tell me straight.

676
01:21:07,476 --> 01:21:14,939
Shyam, can you strip him in public?

677
01:21:18,587 --> 01:21:21,055
The whole world wears my clothes.

678
01:21:21,156 --> 01:21:23,386
You'll have to strip everyone.

679
01:21:24,993 --> 01:21:28,656
Can you stop this man?

680
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:32,992
No.

681
01:21:36,071 --> 01:21:43,102
Neither him, this newspaper,
you, nor your khadi army.

682
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:50,711
l'll stop him.

683
01:22:22,017 --> 01:22:23,177
Brother..

684
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:30,652
This cloth and weight are a
result of a lot of hard work.

685
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:35,054
You have to work
hard too to fight me.

686
01:22:36,265 --> 01:22:39,996
lf you want to fight Gurubhai
you have to become Gurubhai.

687
01:22:42,537 --> 01:22:46,405
But there is only one Gurubhai.

688
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:09,794
You look beautiful.

689
01:23:14,169 --> 01:23:16,000
When you give birth to
a child you'll know.

690
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:19,033
Walking around with a huge tummy..

691
01:23:19,107 --> 01:23:23,043
..vomitting and
getting kicked all day!

692
01:23:28,917 --> 01:23:32,182
You want my tummy to
become like this too?

693
01:23:34,956 --> 01:23:37,948
l look 3-4 months pregnant.

694
01:23:40,062 --> 01:23:42,428
Boy or girl?

695
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:48,127
lt's not just one.

696
01:23:48,837 --> 01:23:50,498
Twins?

697
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,865
There are 25000 people inside.

698
01:23:55,277 --> 01:23:56,437
What are they saying?

699
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:32,173
Welcome Shakti family!

700
01:24:35,217 --> 01:24:38,846
For the first time a company
has held such a meeting in lndia.

701
01:24:38,887 --> 01:24:41,856
You know why? We are so big that..

702
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:44,381
..we can't fit into smaller places.

703
01:24:49,598 --> 01:24:51,828
My apologies to our
brothers from Gujarat..

704
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,926
..who've skipped their
afternoon roll in the bed.

705
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:03,805
A few years ago
Shakti Corp. had debts..

706
01:25:03,879 --> 01:25:09,408
..from the bank, government.

707
01:25:10,852 --> 01:25:13,218
Then l came to you and
you emptied your vaults.

708
01:25:20,195 --> 01:25:22,789
Today we are free.

709
01:25:26,802 --> 01:25:28,793
We do business with our money.

710
01:25:29,938 --> 01:25:33,806
Our own investment. Our own profit.

711
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:41,475
When l first came to Bombay.

712
01:25:44,286 --> 01:25:46,846
l had just two shirts and a coat.

713
01:25:49,591 --> 01:25:54,426
But today the whole of lndia..

714
01:25:54,496 --> 01:25:57,158
..wears our clothes!

715
01:25:58,967 --> 01:26:00,161
Clap.

716
01:26:05,006 --> 01:26:07,338
But l know you aren't happy.

717
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:20,344
You'll be happy only when
we open four more factories.

718
01:26:23,024 --> 01:26:28,155
So what do you say?
Shall we open four more?

719
01:26:29,865 --> 01:26:33,357
You want to become
lndia's biggest company?

720
01:26:36,538 --> 01:26:39,803
l've grown old. Can't hear you.

721
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:50,847
How many Shakti shares do you have?

722
01:26:50,886 --> 01:26:52,353
l'm a reporter.

723
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:55,852
He's a magician.

724
01:26:55,891 --> 01:26:57,017
Write good things about him.

725
01:26:57,092 --> 01:27:00,789
Poverty will disappear if we
have ten men like Gurubhai.

726
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:06,761
Definitely. Read
saturday's Swatantra Samachar.

727
01:27:15,277 --> 01:27:16,505
This shouldn't look like lndia.

728
01:27:16,578 --> 01:27:19,308
And make sure the print looks old.

729
01:27:20,215 --> 01:27:22,376
You're faking photos and
passing them as truth?

730
01:27:23,919 --> 01:27:26,820
Let your Gurubhai come
forward and say it's a lie.

731
01:27:28,223 --> 01:27:29,247
Tear it, so the chalk

732
01:27:29,324 --> 01:27:30,791
powder can be seen.

733
01:27:33,194 --> 01:27:35,025
You've made up the entire story.

734
01:27:35,096 --> 01:27:36,859
lt's written by Gurubhai.
l'm just presenting it.

735
01:27:45,006 --> 01:27:46,268
They dumped cartons like this?

736
01:27:46,341 --> 01:27:49,469
Yes. Empty ones.
Some with chalk powder.

737
01:27:49,544 --> 01:27:51,569
Sent to fake companies
with fake addresses.

738
01:27:51,646 --> 01:27:54,843
Meaning, he showed
empty cartons as export..

739
01:27:57,586 --> 01:28:02,489
..and got the polyester
import license. 700% profit.

740
01:28:03,124 --> 01:28:08,084
Fantastic! Profits from empty boxes!

741
01:28:08,163 --> 01:28:11,030
But his route was fraudulent.

742
01:28:11,099 --> 01:28:12,896
But even you're lying.

743
01:28:14,102 --> 01:28:16,263
This is the truth. Shakti's

744
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:17,930
naked truth.

745
01:28:37,926 --> 01:28:40,793
Lies! They've shot it in Bombay..

746
01:28:40,862 --> 01:28:44,298
..and passing it off as Yemen.

747
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:47,802
l'll stop
advertising in nanaji's paper.

748
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:49,063
Why should they earn from us?

749
01:28:49,137 --> 01:28:50,297
No.

750
01:28:51,806 --> 01:28:54,036
Triple the advertisements.

751
01:28:59,948 --> 01:29:01,279
But Gurubhai..

752
01:29:01,349 --> 01:29:05,786
Print our balance sheets,
new profits..

753
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:12,157
..new companies. Nanaji should
wake up to our growth every morning.

754
01:29:13,161 --> 01:29:14,890
Gurubhai..
- What happened?

755
01:29:15,096 --> 01:29:17,496
What happens usually
with your company.

756
01:29:19,234 --> 01:29:23,102
Double profit. Twins!

757
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:30,478
Send a telegram to my father.

758
01:29:37,018 --> 01:29:39,816
My God! There
really are two of them.

759
01:29:41,956 --> 01:29:44,186
Name.

760
01:29:46,027 --> 01:29:48,928
Disha.
- l only thought of one.

761
01:29:50,999 --> 01:29:53,900
Drishti. Even l had thought of one.

762
01:29:56,337 --> 01:29:59,795
A bonus. By one-get one free.

763
01:30:03,078 --> 01:30:04,136
A pair!

764
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:53,094
''Shakti's fake strength.''

765
01:34:53,368 --> 01:34:56,064
Gurubhai's new trick.

766
01:34:56,237 --> 01:34:59,832
Shakti new share
prices have gone up.

767
01:34:59,907 --> 01:35:03,274
Only the shares are being
bought by Gurubhai's men.

768
01:35:03,478 --> 01:35:05,241
You are bent on crucifying him.

769
01:35:08,316 --> 01:35:09,806
Don't you think the more
you write the bigger..

770
01:35:09,884 --> 01:35:11,215
..the hero he becomes?

771
01:35:12,553 --> 01:35:16,114
Even l've applied
for his new shares.

772
01:35:16,157 --> 01:35:17,215
You..

773
01:35:19,527 --> 01:35:24,294
l've to think of my future.
Who else will? You?

774
01:35:26,367 --> 01:35:27,800
What happened?

775
01:35:32,974 --> 01:35:34,566
Go check the power room.

776
01:35:37,912 --> 01:35:39,311
Any news?

777
01:35:42,283 --> 01:35:44,478
Who could be behind this? 3 guesses.

778
01:35:49,157 --> 01:35:50,146
The power failure is

779
01:35:50,258 --> 01:35:51,282
only on our block.

780
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:52,451
What do you mean?

781
01:35:54,896 --> 01:35:59,060
Go and ensure printing
resumes in 15 minutes. - Yes sir.

782
01:36:00,168 --> 01:36:02,500
l think we won't have
power till late at night.

783
01:36:07,075 --> 01:36:09,441
l don't care. You?

784
01:36:11,012 --> 01:36:12,070
l don't either.

785
01:36:16,284 --> 01:36:18,047
You know what l want to do?

786
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:22,351
A cup of ginger tea?

787
01:36:23,825 --> 01:36:25,292
l want to sing.

788
01:36:26,394 --> 01:36:30,797
So sing. lt's your
grandfather's press..

789
01:36:33,401 --> 01:36:35,301
l want to dance.

790
01:36:35,369 --> 01:36:43,208
Fast fast then slow
then fast, then slow..

791
01:36:43,277 --> 01:36:47,543
l want to live for
three days, without pain..

792
01:36:51,352 --> 01:36:57,814
..without multiple sclerosis, medicines,
wheelchair.. just three days.

793
01:37:02,964 --> 01:37:04,022
Why are you looking at me like that?

794
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:25,009
You were going to
come to bless them.

795
01:37:25,052 --> 01:37:27,816
l had to come to you.

796
01:37:28,222 --> 01:37:30,349
Good.

797
01:37:31,859 --> 01:37:33,918
They'll be like you.

798
01:37:36,397 --> 01:37:39,093
Make them brave and independent.

799
01:37:39,233 --> 01:37:41,827
Get them used to
living without the father.

800
01:37:42,937 --> 01:37:45,531
What if l have to send
your father to jail?

801
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:50,837
How long are you going to fight?

802
01:37:51,646 --> 01:37:53,580
Till l win.

803
01:37:54,582 --> 01:37:56,482
Don't you love him at all?

804
01:37:59,854 --> 01:38:01,287
Don't you think of him as your son?

805
01:38:06,027 --> 01:38:07,756
l asked him the same question..

806
01:38:07,828 --> 01:38:12,925
..and got the same answer.. silence.

807
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:19,865
What is this fight about?
Why are both of you like this?

808
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:24,270
Where's your husband?

809
01:38:48,536 --> 01:38:50,128
He doesn't know l'm here.

810
01:38:52,306 --> 01:38:53,967
Don't.

811
01:38:57,378 --> 01:39:04,113
Manik Das Gupta here.
Don't send your wife to beg.

812
01:39:35,082 --> 01:39:38,813
Why are you hitting the car? Hit me!

813
01:39:40,021 --> 01:39:45,926
l know who sent you!
Tell him l'm not scared!

814
01:40:04,912 --> 01:40:05,970
Did you send them?

815
01:40:06,347 --> 01:40:08,338
Who?
- You sent them.

816
01:40:08,416 --> 01:40:10,543
What are you talking about?

817
01:40:10,584 --> 01:40:11,881
You know what.

818
01:40:13,988 --> 01:40:16,149
They're after your blood.

819
01:40:16,257 --> 01:40:17,315
So?

820
01:40:19,827 --> 01:40:27,427
Just wanted to scare him.
Done with just Rs. 15000.

821
01:40:28,269 --> 01:40:29,327
l don't know what l would've done..

822
01:40:29,403 --> 01:40:30,563
..if it were anyone
else who had done this.

823
01:40:31,405 --> 01:40:32,531
He is like a father to me..

824
01:40:33,841 --> 01:40:35,399
..and one never hits their father.

825
01:40:38,012 --> 01:40:45,316
lf someone hurls a stone
at us, do we remain quiet?

826
01:40:45,419 --> 01:40:46,886
Don't stay quiet.

827
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:50,857
Move ahead. Let them
write, hurl stones..

828
01:40:50,925 --> 01:40:56,488
..talk about the past. We
will talk about tomorrow.

829
01:40:56,564 --> 01:41:00,523
We've come this far
together with our hard work.

830
01:41:02,002 --> 01:41:04,800
Four sheets of paper
can't bring Shakti down.

831
01:41:11,045 --> 01:41:13,843
We won't rest till we
build a plant bigger..

832
01:41:13,914 --> 01:41:17,350
..than Burma Shell. Understood?

833
01:41:21,188 --> 01:41:23,816
Why doesn't it rain the whole year?

834
01:41:24,525 --> 01:41:30,828
Why isn't Bombay cold?
Why doesn't it snow?

835
01:41:31,165 --> 01:41:32,928
Will you marry me?

836
01:41:37,438 --> 01:41:40,896
Wouldn't it be fantastic
if the whole sea was ice?

837
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:43,942
Didn't you hear or
don't you want to marry me?

838
01:41:46,013 --> 01:41:48,607
l want you to drown and die.

839
01:41:50,418 --> 01:41:52,215
Then how will l marry?

840
01:41:54,088 --> 01:41:55,487
Do you know what this is?

841
01:41:58,592 --> 01:42:00,389
And what is that?

842
01:42:00,461 --> 01:42:02,986
A disease of the central
nervous system that has no cure.

843
01:42:04,231 --> 01:42:06,256
You can't live with it.

844
01:42:08,836 --> 01:42:13,364
l can't do anything on my own
except for waking up in the morning.

845
01:42:15,176 --> 01:42:18,942
l've had an attack every
other month since l was ten.

846
01:42:20,247 --> 01:42:22,841
Nothing is beautiful,
everything seems empty.

847
01:42:26,654 --> 01:42:31,057
lf Hamsa is careless,
then the bed gets wet..

848
01:42:34,094 --> 01:42:37,359
Can you sleep on a rubber sheet?

849
01:42:44,905 --> 01:42:46,566
When do we marry?

850
01:42:48,676 --> 01:42:52,043
You're making fun of me.

851
01:42:52,179 --> 01:42:54,875
Your Nanaji said the same thing.

852
01:42:55,115 --> 01:42:56,980
l tried explaining but
he wouldn't understand.

853
01:42:58,018 --> 01:43:07,325
l'll go very far away in four
hundred and nineteen days.. and then?

854
01:43:07,394 --> 01:43:10,886
Then l want every single one of
those four hundred and nineteen days.

855
01:43:16,337 --> 01:43:20,068
Marry me..

856
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:21,232
No..

857
01:44:18,832 --> 01:44:23,235
After six months! The new
minister's given us ten minutes!

858
01:44:23,971 --> 01:44:26,872
lf his uncle was still instead of there
l would've got a meeting in a minute.

859
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:30,843
Ten minutes is enough for you.

860
01:44:34,081 --> 01:44:38,279
You can only say no in ten minutes.

861
01:44:39,386 --> 01:44:41,354
l've had it with hearing 'no'.

862
01:44:48,529 --> 01:44:51,362
Just do some magic on this minister.

863
01:44:52,833 --> 01:44:54,391
Or we're in trouble.

864
01:44:56,036 --> 01:44:57,196
How?

865
01:45:01,375 --> 01:45:05,903
Careful. He's an honest man.

866
01:45:35,275 --> 01:45:37,072
You're in the papers everyday.

867
01:45:39,046 --> 01:45:41,014
Your uncle was a very
good friend of mine.

868
01:45:41,148 --> 01:45:43,844
His friends need not be mine.

869
01:45:44,885 --> 01:45:46,853
A lot is being written against you..

870
01:45:48,055 --> 01:45:49,955
There's a saying in my village.

871
01:45:50,991 --> 01:45:52,982
When people speak against you..

872
01:45:53,527 --> 01:45:55,188
..then you must be progressing.

873
01:45:56,030 --> 01:45:57,861
l'm interested in the
progress of the nation.

874
01:45:57,931 --> 01:45:59,159
Not yours.

875
01:46:03,137 --> 01:46:06,368
Such a big ministry at
such a young age. . .

876
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:12,106
l keep my distance
from people like you..

877
01:46:13,213 --> 01:46:15,807
l have seen your
petrochemical project file..

878
01:46:18,552 --> 01:46:22,852
l haven't come to
talk about the factory..

879
01:46:23,991 --> 01:46:29,452
l've come for your advice..
l've this burden on me.

880
01:46:33,067 --> 01:46:35,865
Your uncle left something with me.

881
01:46:35,936 --> 01:46:42,432
A deposit. l'm a small man
sir, l don't know much..

882
01:46:43,277 --> 01:46:45,507
You just tell me
what to do with it..

883
01:46:46,647 --> 01:46:48,512
..should l return it to you..

884
01:46:48,582 --> 01:46:53,485
..or have it sent overseas?
lt's very heavy.

885
01:46:54,455 --> 01:47:00,860
Anyone would collapse
under it.. me, you.. anybody..

886
01:47:16,410 --> 01:47:19,811
Can this land anywhere?

887
01:47:22,883 --> 01:47:26,910
Captain! Land at a good sweet shop.

888
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:29,352
The minister himself will
come for the inaugural function.

889
01:47:55,916 --> 01:47:57,281
l was waiting for you.

890
01:48:00,487 --> 01:48:07,086
l was surprised that a newspaper
wanted to write something nice about us.

891
01:48:09,263 --> 01:48:11,754
lt's quite a big factory..

892
01:48:11,832 --> 01:48:16,997
lt took seventeen months
and five days to build.

893
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:18,196
So fast?

894
01:48:18,272 --> 01:48:21,833
Our Gurubhai does
everything in a flash.

895
01:48:21,909 --> 01:48:24,036
How long have you known Gurubhai?

896
01:48:24,111 --> 01:48:25,169
From Turkey..

897
01:48:26,079 --> 01:48:29,242
We delivered petrol cans.

898
01:48:29,416 --> 01:48:31,407
And today, l'm the director

899
01:48:31,451 --> 01:48:33,112
of this entire factory.

900
01:48:34,021 --> 01:48:37,013
Where are these machines from?

901
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:38,318
From Dupont.

902
01:48:39,459 --> 01:48:41,256
Do you know where Dupont is?

903
01:48:41,328 --> 01:48:42,386
ln U.S.A.

904
01:48:42,462 --> 01:48:44,054
No, lt's in America.

905
01:48:46,466 --> 01:48:48,957
What's your output?

906
01:48:49,036 --> 01:48:50,901
Fifty five thousand tonnes.

907
01:48:50,971 --> 01:48:52,233
What are you saying?

908
01:48:52,372 --> 01:48:55,830
Sure?
- l'm a director of the company.

909
01:48:57,077 --> 01:48:59,841
But you've government permission..

910
01:48:59,913 --> 01:49:03,246
..to produce only
twenty three thousand tonnes

911
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:10,179
There's no rule that we can't
produce more than that right?

912
01:49:10,257 --> 01:49:14,455
Understand.
government language is such..

913
01:49:16,563 --> 01:49:17,757
But you have machinery..

914
01:49:17,831 --> 01:49:19,264
..with the capacity of only
twenty three thousand tonnes.

915
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:20,823
How come the double output?

916
01:49:25,405 --> 01:49:27,896
We used the spare
parts lying around.

917
01:49:29,243 --> 01:49:33,270
You have permission
for six spinning lines..

918
01:49:33,347 --> 01:49:37,113
..but have set up
twelve spinnin? lines

919
01:49:38,452 --> 01:49:42,320
Who are you?

920
01:49:43,156 --> 01:49:46,785
You smuggled in six
spinning lines as spare parts..

921
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:50,387
..without paying import duty.

922
01:49:52,466 --> 01:49:55,799
What a hoodwink!

923
01:49:56,970 --> 01:49:59,939
Who are you?

924
01:50:00,007 --> 01:50:02,840
A reporter, but you are a smuggler.

925
01:50:03,377 --> 01:50:05,004
Dog..

926
01:50:06,847 --> 01:50:09,372
Easy.. if this photo's printed..

927
01:50:09,449 --> 01:50:11,144
..just think who will be the dog..

928
01:50:13,186 --> 01:50:16,485
Get out!

929
01:50:16,556 --> 01:50:17,818
Two factories running
in the place of one..

930
01:50:17,891 --> 01:50:20,086
..without permission..

931
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:23,823
..without import duty.
Cheating the Excise..

932
01:50:23,897 --> 01:50:26,832
..and export departments.

933
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:28,265
Tell me, what should l write?

934
01:50:28,335 --> 01:50:32,965
Get out of here
before l lose control!

935
01:50:36,209 --> 01:50:38,609
Don't miss the papers tomorrow.

936
01:50:38,679 --> 01:50:40,874
One man is working here..

937
01:50:40,948 --> 01:50:44,884
..and all you
bastards are attacking him..

938
01:50:45,485 --> 01:50:47,885
And one day, Ghanshyam
uncle said that nobody..

939
01:50:47,921 --> 01:50:51,015
..could swim to the other
side. Then what did he say?

940
01:50:51,091 --> 01:50:52,854
Take a bet!

941
01:50:52,926 --> 01:50:56,123
And what was the bet?
- Jumpa's dance!

942
01:50:56,196 --> 01:50:59,962
And how was the water?
- Cold

943
01:51:00,033 --> 01:51:03,799
Very cold.

944
01:51:03,870 --> 01:51:05,963
So Papa kept swimming,..
and what did he see?

945
01:51:06,039 --> 01:51:08,473
A very big fish.

946
01:51:08,542 --> 01:51:10,942
Which fish?

947
01:51:11,845 --> 01:51:13,312
Phone call..

948
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:15,109
We're escaping from
the shark.. one minute..

949
01:51:15,182 --> 01:51:17,980
lt's Rinku,
Ganshyambhai's daughter, from ldhar.

950
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:18,168
Slit his wrists with
a vegetable knife.

951
01:52:18,245 --> 01:52:21,908
No one knew for half an hour..

952
01:52:27,988 --> 01:52:29,387
Take her outside.

953
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:51,174
l've come to slap you.

954
01:52:52,879 --> 01:52:55,871
Slap you so hard that this
pain'll feel like nothing.

955
01:53:05,492 --> 01:53:10,293
Kill me. Here, slit my wrists..

956
01:53:11,398 --> 01:53:14,026
..because after you,
it'll be my turn.

957
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:19,795
You've been with me
since Turkey.. and then..

958
01:53:19,873 --> 01:53:22,433
..just like that.. you'll go?

959
01:53:25,312 --> 01:53:30,443
lf anything happens to you..
because of my mistake..

960
01:53:35,856 --> 01:53:40,555
..i couldn't bear it Guru.

961
01:53:49,369 --> 01:53:50,893
You're happy now?

962
01:53:53,039 --> 01:53:55,269
When that headmaster went..

963
01:53:55,342 --> 01:53:59,142
l didn't shed a tear.. step
mother died, l didn't cry..

964
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:01,806
..it's just that you're so ugly..

965
01:54:12,926 --> 01:54:18,023
..that it's making me cry..

966
01:54:30,177 --> 01:54:36,514
Even Jumpa never cried
looking at my face..

967
01:54:37,484 --> 01:54:38,576
What?!

968
01:54:38,985 --> 01:54:42,944
Jumpa, the belly dancer, Turkey.

969
01:55:23,163 --> 01:55:25,063
We have many battles to fight..

970
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:29,925
l can't do it
without you big brother..

971
01:55:47,153 --> 01:55:49,178
Come in.. the door is open.

972
01:55:49,256 --> 01:55:51,019
You come out, l want to talk to you.

973
01:55:51,291 --> 01:55:52,883
l can't.

974
01:56:04,771 --> 01:56:05,863
What kind of a man are you?

975
01:56:08,308 --> 01:56:09,935
Do you even know what you're doing?

976
01:56:11,811 --> 01:56:16,145
Seasoning.. will
you eat? l cook well..

977
01:56:16,483 --> 01:56:20,010
You're insane. Why
are you doing this?

978
01:56:20,053 --> 01:56:22,112
For fame, money? To
threaten? What for?

979
01:56:25,191 --> 01:56:29,355
Do you know five foreign companies
have invested in Shakti Corporation?

980
01:56:32,065 --> 01:56:38,026
So?
- All five are bogus companies.

981
01:56:42,275 --> 01:56:43,833
Can you prove it?

982
01:56:45,011 --> 01:56:47,343
Truth is truth even without proof.

983
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:49,844
Can you prove it or not?

984
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:53,078
l can. l can also prove..

985
01:56:53,286 --> 01:56:55,846
..you've joined hands
with ministers to convert..

986
01:56:55,889 --> 01:56:58,858
..non-convertible
debentures into shares.

987
01:56:59,159 --> 01:57:02,424
Shakti Corp's reach is in
every department of the government.

988
01:57:05,965 --> 01:57:09,765
You come to know of new laws
before they come into force..

989
01:57:09,836 --> 01:57:13,772
..and use that to play
with the public's money.

990
01:57:15,175 --> 01:57:16,802
Do you have a conscience..

991
01:57:16,876 --> 01:57:18,810
..or have you taken a
loan against that too?

992
01:57:19,913 --> 01:57:20,971
What is this?

993
01:57:24,351 --> 01:57:25,443
What is it to you?

994
01:57:32,258 --> 01:57:33,782
You got married?

995
01:57:34,527 --> 01:57:35,960
Should l have asked you?

996
01:57:37,931 --> 01:57:39,125
Where is she?

997
01:58:01,821 --> 01:58:03,186
How come you're here?

998
01:58:03,289 --> 01:58:04,950
How come you're here?

999
01:58:05,859 --> 01:58:07,190
What to do?

1000
01:58:07,861 --> 01:58:09,988
You just weren't leaving Didi..

1001
01:58:10,130 --> 01:58:12,098
l was forced to get married.

1002
01:58:12,265 --> 01:58:13,357
You didn't invite me?

1003
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:17,365
Not even Nanaji.

1004
01:58:18,371 --> 01:58:21,807
He kept his favourite
reporter and kicked me out..

1005
01:58:21,875 --> 01:58:26,039
..he said that l'd become
a little too independent.

1006
01:58:29,883 --> 01:58:35,116
You couldn't find anyone
else in sixty crore people?

1007
01:58:35,522 --> 01:58:42,394
But he's a good guy.. have
you come to fight with him?

1008
01:58:44,931 --> 01:58:48,230
l wanted to say a few things to
him

1009
01:58:48,301 --> 01:58:50,235
..but you've shut my mouth.

1010
01:58:54,908 --> 01:59:00,244
Make sure you love my
jalkukdi more than you hate me..

1011
01:59:00,847 --> 01:59:02,439
Do you need proof for that as well?

1012
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:15,921
You look very weak.

1013
01:59:15,995 --> 01:59:17,758
You've become very fat.

1014
01:59:19,332 --> 01:59:21,493
Weak.
- Fat.

1015
01:59:27,106 --> 01:59:29,267
Nothing is going to
change between us.

1016
01:59:30,343 --> 01:59:32,140
When you hear my voice..

1017
01:59:33,513 --> 01:59:35,811
..be certain that you're
doing something wrong.

1018
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:44,151
The louder your voice,
the more l'll grow.

1019
01:59:52,332 --> 01:59:53,526
l'll leave.

1020
02:00:17,123 --> 02:00:20,183
Gurukant Desai
salutes the Shakti family!

1021
02:00:26,099 --> 02:00:31,162
You're angry. Good.

1022
02:00:31,237 --> 02:00:33,205
l'm very angry too.

1023
02:00:34,607 --> 02:00:35,869
You've asked me a lot of questions..

1024
02:00:35,942 --> 02:00:37,876
..now let me ask you a few.

1025
02:00:42,382 --> 02:00:48,287
lf someone flings muck at
our family, what do we do?

1026
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:52,383
Do we start fighting
amongst ourselves?

1027
02:00:53,092 --> 02:00:54,855
Can a family survive like that?

1028
02:00:58,064 --> 02:01:01,261
You ask me why the papers are
writing articles against us.

1029
02:01:01,935 --> 02:01:08,465
Because we are commoners,
middle class.

1030
02:01:09,442 --> 02:01:15,039
The rich hate it
that the middle class..

1031
02:01:15,915 --> 02:01:18,475
..is now writing it's own destiny.

1032
02:01:19,252 --> 02:01:20,947
What do you say to this?

1033
02:01:24,924 --> 02:01:26,118
Answer!

1034
02:01:28,294 --> 02:01:29,886
What has happened to our money?

1035
02:01:29,963 --> 02:01:31,328
What's happened? Answer!

1036
02:01:32,999 --> 02:01:36,059
Next year our turnover
will be hundred crores.

1037
02:01:36,135 --> 02:01:39,332
You have stolen and
made us thieves too.

1038
02:01:40,139 --> 02:01:42,471
Who was that?
- You're a smuggler!

1039
02:01:42,542 --> 02:01:46,239
You steal! Give us back our money!

1040
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:51,116
We will make bigger profits;
l will not sink your money.

1041
02:01:52,885 --> 02:01:56,377
You wear fancy suits and
drive away in a Mercedes.

1042
02:01:56,422 --> 02:01:57,912
We'll be out on the streets!

1043
02:01:57,991 --> 02:01:59,982
We want accountability!

1044
02:02:01,995 --> 02:02:04,122
Death to Gurubhai!

1045
02:03:03,222 --> 02:03:06,020
We didn't have money
to white-wash the house.

1046
02:03:07,393 --> 02:03:11,796
You said the house looks best the
way it is. lt looks like a home.

1047
02:03:17,036 --> 02:03:20,096
Were you telling the truth or
were you trying to pacify me?

1048
02:03:20,173 --> 02:03:21,265
Wallet.

1049
02:03:23,242 --> 02:03:25,335
You would forget your wallet.

1050
02:03:30,883 --> 02:03:31,941
What happened?

1051
02:03:31,984 --> 02:03:33,383
l forgot my wallet.

1052
02:03:34,554 --> 02:03:37,955
l would climb two steps

1053
02:03:38,024 --> 02:03:41,960
at a time to come to you.

1054
02:03:46,566 --> 02:03:49,467
And you would stand right here.

1055
02:03:58,544 --> 02:03:59,875
l won't give it.

1056
02:04:00,947 --> 02:04:03,211
Your brother is waiting downstairs.
He will kill me.

1057
02:04:03,282 --> 02:04:05,045
You can't die for me?

1058
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:09,012
lf l die, who will you fight with?

1059
02:04:10,857 --> 02:04:12,882
Praise me.
- What?

1060
02:04:12,959 --> 02:04:14,483
Say something nice.

1061
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:19,796
You shine brighter than polyester.

1062
02:04:20,299 --> 02:04:24,793
Don't talk like a laundryman.
Always talking about polyester.

1063
02:04:27,507 --> 02:04:28,906
You're the most
beautiful girl in the locality.

1064
02:04:30,076 --> 02:04:31,475
So you look at others?

1065
02:04:31,944 --> 02:04:35,345
l don't. Now give it.

1066
02:04:38,351 --> 02:04:39,875
Forget it tomorrow as well.

1067
02:04:42,054 --> 02:04:44,215
As long as you're with me
how can l remember anything?

1068
02:04:45,291 --> 02:04:46,417
Beast!

1069
02:04:50,329 --> 02:04:52,058
How do l look to you?

1070
02:05:01,307 --> 02:05:03,468
Your face resembles my husband's.

1071
02:05:07,079 --> 02:05:09,445
Do l look like a thief?

1072
02:05:15,421 --> 02:05:19,152
Neither a thief nor a weakling.

1073
02:05:32,905 --> 02:05:34,167
What if my brother comes?

1074
02:05:39,579 --> 02:05:42,241
Always arrives at the wrong time.

1075
02:05:49,989 --> 02:05:54,824
Where's everybody?

1076
02:05:56,262 --> 02:06:01,165
Poor thing.

1077
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:09,798
Jungleeram!

1078
02:06:09,876 --> 02:06:10,968
Mirchi rani!

1079
02:06:12,111 --> 02:06:14,204
Me?
- Who else?

1080
02:06:14,413 --> 02:06:17,348
Ready to fight.

1081
02:06:18,251 --> 02:06:21,516
Lies. You used to beat poor old me.

1082
02:06:21,621 --> 02:06:23,316
When did l hit you?

1083
02:06:26,192 --> 02:06:27,284
Here, like this.

1084
02:06:37,036 --> 02:06:38,162
You will lose.

1085
02:06:41,574 --> 02:06:43,007
What's happened to you?

1086
02:06:46,846 --> 02:06:48,336
Forgotten how to play?

1087
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:04,988
Listen.

1088
02:07:13,539 --> 02:07:16,303
l am going down to get an ambulance.

1089
02:07:17,143 --> 02:07:20,135
Are you listening?
Just keep breathing.

1090
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:23,007
Ok? Don't be scared?

1091
02:07:23,149 --> 02:07:24,446
l'll be right back out.

1092
02:07:51,510 --> 02:07:53,478
Gurubhai has had a paralytic stroke.

1093
02:07:54,981 --> 02:07:56,312
There was a telex from the P.T. l.

1094
02:07:56,515 --> 02:08:01,782
That means he can't move
the right side at all.

1095
02:08:02,088 --> 02:08:06,081
Can't do any work.

1096
02:08:07,226 --> 02:08:10,753
He's younger to me by
at least 20-25 years.

1097
02:08:11,897 --> 02:08:14,161
An attack at this age?

1098
02:08:17,770 --> 02:08:19,032
Maybe because of us?

1099
02:08:21,307 --> 02:08:22,365
What?

1100
02:08:24,910 --> 02:08:29,938
You, me, Swatantra
- everybody is at him.

1101
02:08:33,552 --> 02:08:35,816
ln fact another article
is coming out tomorrow.

1102
02:08:37,957 --> 02:08:39,288
Shall l stop it?

1103
02:08:48,234 --> 02:08:51,965
ls it the truth?

1104
02:08:53,806 --> 02:08:54,898
Then print it. Why fear
the truth?

1105
02:08:54,974 --> 02:08:56,032
Which hospital?

1106
02:08:58,477 --> 02:09:00,001
Are you going to see him?

1107
02:09:02,381 --> 02:09:06,511
No. Why should l?

1108
02:09:08,888 --> 02:09:10,253
l won't go there.

1109
02:10:09,081 --> 02:10:12,141
Checking to see if he's alive?

1110
02:10:14,153 --> 02:10:15,450
He is.

1111
02:10:16,856 --> 02:10:18,949
ln two months l'll make
him fit enough to fight you.

1112
02:12:24,984 --> 02:12:26,975
We want to meet Mr. Gurukant Desai?

1113
02:12:27,853 --> 02:12:29,445
You are?

1114
02:12:29,855 --> 02:12:31,846
We have summons for him.

1115
02:12:31,924 --> 02:12:32,982
For what?

1116
02:12:33,125 --> 02:12:34,820
Thapar Commission's final hearing..

1117
02:12:34,893 --> 02:12:37,953
..against Shakti
Corporation on the 16th of October.

1118
02:12:38,230 --> 02:12:40,562
But he's asleep..

1119
02:12:40,633 --> 02:12:42,430
l have to give it to him.

1120
02:12:42,501 --> 02:12:46,403
But visiting hours are over..
please come later.

1121
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:49,368
We have court orders.

1122
02:12:49,508 --> 02:12:54,878
You will have to appear
before the Thapar Commission..

1123
02:12:54,947 --> 02:13:01,819
.. at ten thirty on the 16th of
October, 1980. Sign here.

1124
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:16,127
He's asking if you
would like some tea?

1125
02:13:19,972 --> 02:13:22,372
Only on the copy.

1126
02:13:35,954 --> 02:13:38,081
Gurubhai will see you on the 16th.

1127
02:13:43,028 --> 02:13:45,428
Please come fully prepared.

1128
02:14:14,993 --> 02:14:16,051
Sir, just a minute..

1129
02:14:37,983 --> 02:14:40,247
Gurubhai has a request..

1130
02:14:40,886 --> 02:14:43,821
..could you please repeat
everything that you just said..

1131
02:14:43,889 --> 02:14:44,981
..in Hindi?

1132
02:14:48,894 --> 02:14:52,159
We're villagers..
our English is weak.

1133
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:58,033
Both my language and l are strong.

1134
02:14:59,004 --> 02:15:02,235
Which one would you
like to test, Shri Desai?

1135
02:15:10,215 --> 02:15:12,308
What test? You can take our lives..

1136
02:15:12,351 --> 02:15:14,114
..but whatever you do,

1137
02:15:14,219 --> 02:15:15,811
just do it in Hindi.

1138
02:15:15,854 --> 02:15:18,414
Will you be answering.. or will he?

1139
02:15:18,490 --> 02:15:21,516
The answers are his,
only the voice is mine.

1140
02:15:21,593 --> 02:15:26,895
ls your wife a Shakti employee?

1141
02:15:26,965 --> 02:15:29,798
An officer? Or a director?

1142
02:15:34,506 --> 02:15:37,407
lf you aren't, what are you
doing here? Please leave..

1143
02:15:53,892 --> 02:15:56,087
l am the owner of Shakti..

1144
02:15:56,829 --> 02:15:59,127
..initial promoter..

1145
02:15:59,198 --> 02:16:02,292
..and 50 percent
shareholder in the holding company.

1146
02:16:02,367 --> 02:16:04,767
Here are the Memorandum
and Articles of Association..

1147
02:16:04,837 --> 02:16:08,170
..of the holding company
and the annual returns.

1148
02:16:13,178 --> 02:16:19,811
This means you'll also
have to go to jail with him.

1149
02:16:22,354 --> 02:16:24,083
We are 50 percent partners.

1150
02:16:25,057 --> 02:16:26,820
Wherever we go, we'll go together.

1151
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,763
Your company has
given all of them land..

1152
02:18:16,835 --> 02:18:18,359
..gifts and money.. why?

1153
02:18:22,374 --> 02:18:23,432
He raises his own share prices.

1154
02:18:23,508 --> 02:18:25,032
He has a nexus with the brokers.

1155
02:18:25,110 --> 02:18:26,407
We have our own broking company.

1156
02:18:26,812 --> 02:18:31,146
He has attempted a hostile
takeover of two companies.

1157
02:18:34,119 --> 02:18:37,111
lmport duty evasion, 12 crores..
for four factories.

1158
02:18:45,297 --> 02:18:47,788
He converts non
convertible debentures.

1159
02:18:47,866 --> 02:18:49,800
He then turns these
debentures into shares..

1160
02:18:49,868 --> 02:18:50,926
..and clears all his debts.

1161
02:18:51,003 --> 02:18:52,971
These conversions
should be disallowed.

1162
02:19:04,583 --> 02:19:08,917
Many accusations have
come up against you today.

1163
02:19:09,888 --> 02:19:11,856
Do you have a response?

1164
02:19:15,127 --> 02:19:19,461
This hearing is in
private Only today.

1165
02:19:22,968 --> 02:19:25,960
Tomorrow the press and
the public will be here.

1166
02:19:27,806 --> 02:19:29,797
You'd better accept

1167
02:19:29,875 --> 02:19:31,433
all the charges today.

1168
02:19:35,147 --> 02:19:39,914
lf there is anything you would
like to say in your defence..

1169
02:19:39,951 --> 02:19:41,009
..you may do so now.

1170
02:19:54,199 --> 02:19:56,292
Only one thing..

1171
02:20:06,511 --> 02:20:07,569
Namaste.

1172
02:21:24,990 --> 02:21:27,515
Don't touch me.

1173
02:21:30,061 --> 02:21:32,962
l drive a taxi from
Wadala to Churchgate.

1174
02:21:34,099 --> 02:21:37,830
l've Shakti shares. l've got my
three daughters married with that.

1175
02:21:38,270 --> 02:21:39,567
That's all l wanted to say.

1176
02:21:40,005 --> 02:21:41,404
Thank you.

1177
02:21:41,940 --> 02:21:44,500
Don't worry.. because l am with you.

1178
02:22:02,828 --> 02:22:06,355
Please be silent.

1179
02:22:14,973 --> 02:22:17,840
This commission has heard
all the arguments against..

1180
02:22:17,909 --> 02:22:21,310
..and in defence of
Shakti Corporation.

1181
02:22:22,113 --> 02:22:24,843
The commission will
declare it's report..

1182
02:22:24,883 --> 02:22:27,181
..and recommendations.. after lunch.

1183
02:22:32,123 --> 02:22:36,321
Gurubhai requests your
permission to say something.

1184
02:22:39,931 --> 02:22:41,831
He was given an
opportunity yesterday..

1185
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:44,027
..but he just said namaste and left.

1186
02:22:48,139 --> 02:22:52,337
We were told that
your voice is very weak.

1187
02:22:56,882 --> 02:23:02,149
l'm a businessman. l spend
everything very carefully..

1188
02:23:03,788 --> 02:23:06,382
l saved my voice for today.

1189
02:23:07,459 --> 02:23:09,791
Beware of what you say.
The public is present..

1190
02:23:09,861 --> 02:23:12,421
..what you say
could go against? you.

1191
02:23:15,033 --> 02:23:17,092
Why fear the public..

1192
02:23:18,370 --> 02:23:21,362
..l am the public.. may l speak?

1193
02:23:22,507 --> 02:23:23,565
Five minutes.

1194
02:23:31,283 --> 02:23:35,344
May l stand, or do l
need a license for that too?

1195
02:24:00,879 --> 02:24:03,177
You say l'm against the law.

1196
02:24:05,850 --> 02:24:09,809
Forty years ago another
man was against the law.

1197
02:24:12,524 --> 02:24:14,515
Today we call him Gandhiji.

1198
02:24:17,462 --> 02:24:23,458
ln his time slavery was the
law.. he wrote a new law..

1199
02:24:23,535 --> 02:24:25,162
..our freedom.

1200
02:24:28,473 --> 02:24:30,134
l'm not Bapu.

1201
02:24:31,543 --> 02:24:33,977
All l know is business..

1202
02:24:35,981 --> 02:24:39,041
..and to work hard, and poverty.

1203
02:24:44,522 --> 02:24:45,819
l came to Bombay with two shirts..

1204
02:24:45,890 --> 02:24:48,154
..a wife and a brother-in-law.

1205
02:24:50,495 --> 02:24:52,122
l wanted to do business.

1206
02:24:58,903 --> 02:25:01,963
But the doors to business
opened only for the rich.

1207
02:25:05,410 --> 02:25:09,813
Doors made by the government..

1208
02:25:09,881 --> 02:25:14,818
..opened either to
a bribe or a kick.

1209
02:25:14,853 --> 02:25:15,911
l did both.

1210
02:25:17,355 --> 02:25:19,255
Where l had to kick, l kicked.

1211
02:25:19,891 --> 02:25:22,451
Where you wanted me to
salute, l saluted..

1212
02:25:24,996 --> 02:25:30,400
..and today you ask why
this man kicks so much..

1213
02:25:30,468 --> 02:25:32,527
..he salutes too much.

1214
02:25:37,008 --> 02:25:38,441
What are you angry about?

1215
02:25:40,011 --> 02:25:43,469
My growth, or the
speed of my growth?

1216
02:25:45,884 --> 02:25:47,852
Or that l've
surpassed your expectations..

1217
02:25:47,886 --> 02:25:50,150
..of an ordinary villager?

1218
02:25:53,591 --> 02:25:56,059
You've made allegations against me..

1219
02:25:56,194 --> 02:25:59,960
..excise, custom, income tax,
this tax.. that tax.

1220
02:26:01,966 --> 02:26:03,456
When l started business..

1221
02:26:03,768 --> 02:26:05,963
..l didn't even know the
meaning of these words.

1222
02:26:09,207 --> 02:26:12,540
l fell many times before l learnt.

1223
02:26:18,049 --> 02:26:20,813
To save money l walked 20 kms..

1224
02:26:20,852 --> 02:26:24,253
..from Pydhonie carrying huge
bales of polyester on my head.

1225
02:26:28,059 --> 02:26:30,789
l know the value of money.

1226
02:26:36,201 --> 02:26:38,795
lf there was money to be made..

1227
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:42,431
..l made it.. not just for myself..

1228
02:26:43,374 --> 02:26:46,343
..but for my 30 lakh
shareholders as well.

1229
02:26:50,982 --> 02:26:52,973
You have 3 minutes left.

1230
02:27:00,758 --> 02:27:05,889
l don't know how to play golf
and l don't go to horse races..

1231
02:27:07,132 --> 02:27:09,862
..but l'm a solid
player in my business.

1232
02:27:12,103 --> 02:27:13,161
l know how to make the

1233
02:27:13,238 --> 02:27:14,432
best quality polyester..

1234
02:27:15,874 --> 02:27:17,239
..fibre..

1235
02:27:18,209 --> 02:27:19,471
..chemicals..

1236
02:27:19,544 --> 02:27:23,105
..at the cheapest price. ..

1237
02:27:25,316 --> 02:27:29,013
ls that my mistake?
Should l apologize?

1238
02:27:33,191 --> 02:27:35,785
l roamed around carrying cans
as a petrol pump assistant..

1239
02:27:35,860 --> 02:27:39,921
..just like our country goes
to the World Bank begging.

1240
02:27:39,998 --> 02:27:42,057
''Give us money
- we want to make roads.''

1241
02:27:43,067 --> 02:27:44,466
Why can't we change our destiny?

1242
02:27:44,536 --> 02:27:46,026
Ours and our country's?

1243
02:27:47,005 --> 02:27:49,166
You want me to deliver petrol cans..

1244
02:27:49,974 --> 02:27:52,841
..and our country to beg, forever.

1245
02:27:54,846 --> 02:27:56,313
Why can't we reach the top?

1246
02:27:57,148 --> 02:27:59,378
Why are we called the third world?

1247
02:28:00,251 --> 02:28:03,084
We have as much right to be a
first world country.. and we can be!

1248
02:28:11,963 --> 02:28:14,363
l've lost a lot reaching here..

1249
02:28:16,935 --> 02:28:18,960
l lost this hand.

1250
02:28:19,037 --> 02:28:20,095
Damn thing hangs uselessly!

1251
02:28:26,077 --> 02:28:28,011
And by the time this enquiry ends..

1252
02:28:28,079 --> 02:28:30,138
..l don't know what
else l will lose..

1253
02:28:32,250 --> 02:28:34,445
..my voice, my mind..

1254
02:28:36,254 --> 02:28:38,950
..but there is one thing you
can never snatch from me..

1255
02:28:42,093 --> 02:28:47,793
..my courage. l won't lose
that. Because my courage..

1256
02:28:47,865 --> 02:28:49,457
..is the common man's courage..

1257
02:28:49,534 --> 02:28:51,195
..this country's courage.

1258
02:28:54,038 --> 02:28:56,336
All of you want to
stop me, don't you?

1259
02:28:57,041 --> 02:29:02,138
l'm not alone.. the whole
country is moving ahead with me.

1260
02:29:02,947 --> 02:29:04,778
And neither you nor your laws..

1261
02:29:04,816 --> 02:29:07,910
..have the strength
to stop the country.

1262
02:29:10,388 --> 02:29:13,789
The doors you want to keep
closed, are opening up..

1263
02:29:13,858 --> 02:29:15,826
..we have our feet
through the doors..

1264
02:29:15,893 --> 02:29:17,793
..and our feet are very strong.

1265
02:29:21,499 --> 02:29:24,764
Which enquiry can
check the progress..

1266
02:29:24,836 --> 02:29:27,999
..of this country
and stop it? Tell me!

1267
02:29:41,452 --> 02:29:43,420
You gave me five minutes.

1268
02:29:44,355 --> 02:29:47,017
l've finished in four
and a half minutes..

1269
02:29:48,893 --> 02:29:51,054
30 seconds profit.

1270
02:29:55,199 --> 02:29:57,064
That's business.

1271
02:29:58,903 --> 02:30:02,066
lf you want to punish
me for that as well..

1272
02:30:02,140 --> 02:30:03,198
..go ahead.

1273
02:30:04,242 --> 02:30:07,405
Gurukant Desai is not
scared of punishment..

1274
02:30:39,077 --> 02:30:40,476
Well, he's said a lot.

1275
02:30:44,315 --> 02:30:47,284
What do you think? ls
he a genius or a thug?

1276
02:30:47,385 --> 02:30:48,977
Both.

1277
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:54,251
Whatever it is, we
can't hang him, can we?

1278
02:30:58,129 --> 02:31:00,791
Out of the 29
allegations levelled against..

1279
02:31:00,865 --> 02:31:03,459
..Shakti Corporation, 2 are proved.

1280
02:31:03,968 --> 02:31:09,497
Shakti Corporation is
fined Rs. 63,96,000 lakhs.

1281
02:31:22,487 --> 02:31:26,014
Gurukant Desai
salutes the Shakti family.

1282
02:31:37,068 --> 02:31:39,332
''Don't dream.''

1283
02:31:42,373 --> 02:31:44,238
''Dreams never come true.''

1284
02:31:45,576 --> 02:31:47,339
My father would say.

1285
02:31:49,414 --> 02:31:55,319
But l dreamt. We all dreamt.

1286
02:31:57,655 --> 02:32:01,989
Dreamt of becoming the
biggest company in lndia.

1287
02:32:06,197 --> 02:32:09,223
Has our dream come true?

1288
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:13,134
Yes.

1289
02:32:13,204 --> 02:32:17,038
And, do we stop now?

1290
02:32:17,108 --> 02:32:19,167
No.

1291
02:32:19,444 --> 02:32:21,844
Or do we dream more?

1292
02:32:21,913 --> 02:32:24,848
Yes.

1293
02:32:25,149 --> 02:32:28,380
Shall we become the
world's biggest company?

1294
02:32:28,453 --> 02:32:31,286
Yes.

1295
02:32:43,501 --> 02:32:46,265
Shall we tell the
world that we are coming?

1296
02:32:46,337 --> 02:32:49,397
Yes.
