1
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,400
'Dare the deal'

2
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,720
'If you are angry with him...'

3
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,360
'...why show it on
household activities?'

4
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,760
'Give me the file, dad
I'm late for my interview'

5
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
'I know your pathetic efforts
at being interviewed'

6
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,720
'Listen to me'

7
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,320
'Stop being obsessed with media'

8
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,000
'Get a proper job'

9
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,280
'Dad, I've graduated in
visual communications'

10
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,880
'Media is my line'

11
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,640
'Isn't your classmate Prakash
working in a call center?'

12
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,840
'Yes and he dates a girl a day'

13
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,200
'You want my son to gallivant
with girls the same way?'

14
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,320
'Ma, whatever you say
he won't understand'

15
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,280
'Get me the file'

16
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,480
'I am late for the interview'

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,120
'Why are you torturing him like this?'

18
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
'Leave him to do his own thing'

19
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,280
'Your father wanted you
to become a doctor'

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,440
'Did you fulfill his wish?'

21
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,400
'Shut up, I might
end up cussing you'

22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,120
'Your son is old enough
to get married'

23
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,680
'If he is jobless, who will get
his daughter married to him?'

24
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,120
'Why should we hunt for a bride?'

25
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,600
'He can marry my brother's daughter'

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,600
'Bad enough I married you
and ruined my life'

27
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,680
'Should we add one more
from your blessed family?'

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,920
'Don't try to malign
my family unnecessarily'

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,040
'If a monkey face like you can
find a beautiful wife like me...'

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,360
'...my son is like a prince'

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,840
'Won't he find a beautiful bride?'

32
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,000
'Dad, consider this
my last interview'

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,760
'Just wait and see, I will get
a job in some TV channel'

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
'I'll become rich and famous'

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,880
'Then you'll proclaim I'm your son
to the whole world with pride'

36
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,240
'Karthi, either you should
listen to others'

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,880
'Or you should have
brains of your own'

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,080
'You have neither'

39
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
'Rot in hell any which way'

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,840
'Why do you get angry
without any reason?'

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,000
'He is your son'

42
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,800
'He will naturally be
as stubborn as you'

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,320
'How can you
call me stubborn?'

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
'If I was stubborn...'

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,280
'...why would I have
married you?'

46
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,480
'I would have married
the girl I fell in love with!'

47
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,120
Anna?

48
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,000
Where is Top TV here?

49
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,800
I am myself pissed without
a single sale from the morning

50
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,120
Akka?

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,760
There's a boy here

52
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,120
Did you take any clothes to iron?

53
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,120
No, I didn't

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,440
I'm joining in a job in Top TV

55
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to know the correct address

56
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,000
You better be on your way

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,320
Or I'll press this iron on your face!

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,440
Sir, do you know
the way to Top TV?

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,640
Don't glare at me, sir

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,120
I know it's a dumbass channel

61
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,000
Total waste of time

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,880
Of no use to anyone

63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
I won't watch, you don't either
This is what you wanted to say

64
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,240
I know that too, sir
But I need this job

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,400
If you know tell me

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,320
But don't get mad
at me for this, sir

67
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,000
Go straight

68
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
1st right
2nd left

69
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,080
3rd building

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Hello sir!

71
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,560
Is no one here?

72
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,480
Whom do you want to meet?

73
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,760
Good morning, madam

74
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,080
Isn't this Top TV?

75
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,520
Why doubt that?

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,400
I've also been
to many interviews

77
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,040
They promote their programs

78
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
I can't see your program
in any of the TVs here

79
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,720
Won't your boss
be mad about this?

80
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,640
I am following
the orders of my boss

81
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,800
Why did you come here?

82
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,240
Parthasarathy
Interview

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,800
Go straight
Turn right

84
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,240
Instead of showing your boss's room
you're sending me to a go-down

85
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,800
That is his room

86
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,080
'Boss's room?'

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't worry

88
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,360
I won't feel bad

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,240
I wasn't shocked about
this morning's incident

90
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,000
Though this room
is so dusty...

91
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,600
...you're sitting royally like
a judge in a reality show

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,120
Like Ms Roly-poly?

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,920
Sit down

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,080
Thank you

95
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,960
Parthasarathy told me about you

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,400
- Is this your file?
- Yes sir

97
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
Parthasarathy himself
is a vagabond

98
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,280
And he is recommending him

99
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,360
Shall I start the questions?

100
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,400
1st question

101
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,400
Who invented television?

102
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,000
Maybe Newton

103
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,360
Forget that

104
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,160
Who invented the camera?

105
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,440
The one they roll
and take pictures?

106
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,600
What director Balu Mahendra uses

107
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,880
You don't know even that?

108
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,800
I don't know, sir

109
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,680
What the hell do you know?

110
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,000
- Get lost!
- Thank you sir

111
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,440
Don't stand here
Clear out

112
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,680
What a lousy bunch!

113
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,680
Is this an office?

114
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
Layered with dust

115
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,000
Where is the maid?

116
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,160
'Sir, she hasn't been paid as yet'

117
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,760
I have to sweep and
mop the floor too

118
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
Sir...sir...sir

119
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
Why are you walking away?

120
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,320
You got the job

121
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,760
I didn't answer
a single question

122
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,480
If you had answered
even 1 question...

123
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,040
...you wouldn't have
got the job

124
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,160
What are you saying?

125
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,160
If you had answered
all the questions cleverly...

126
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,320
...you would have
to be paid, right?

127
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,120
Any way
All the best

128
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,040
Congratulations

129
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,840
'Your bad time has started'

130
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,360
Who are you?

131
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,640
You're barging in

132
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,240
New staff

133
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,680
Your boss appointed me yesterday

134
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,080
Boss doesn't have the final word

135
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,000
Billa has to approve of you

136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,200
Where is Billa?

137
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
'Take the stairs'

138
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,760
'Here I am
Your 'la'

139
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,960
'Billa'

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,600
'There are so many TV channels
and programs in the world'

141
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,520
Can I meet Bill-

142
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,120
Wait, he is recording
a program inside

143
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,840
'To million aunties sitting near
the phone waiting to talk to me'

144
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,640
'...clad in their night dresses'

145
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,400
'Uncles who take these
aunties shopping...'

146
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,360
'...and stand stranded in
the middle of the road'

147
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,600
'Boys who keep withdrawing from
ATMs to spend for their girlfriends...'

148
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,640
'...who are now penniless and working
as watchman in the same ATM'

149
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,160
'Warm welcome to
each and every one of you'

150
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,800
'Let us see who
our first caller is'

151
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,840
'This is Top TV Billa speaking'

152
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,160
'Who is on the line?'

153
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,360
'I am Kaveri speaking
from Poonamallee'

154
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
'Tell me, Kaveri'

155
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,080
'Sir, I just can't believe this'

156
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,800
'I have been trying
for 1 whole year'

157
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
'I got through only now'

158
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,080
'So many girls and ladies...'

159
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,680
'...are trying to get me
for many years'

160
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,520
Sir!

161
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,840
'I mean to request a song'

162
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,920
'You are very lucky
You got through so soon'

163
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,720
'My friend wants to
talk to you, sir'

164
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,080
'Is that so?
Is she pretty?'

165
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,480
'If she's pretty
I'll talk to her'

166
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,680
I heard this channel is junk

167
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
They are so busy

168
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
'What song do you want?'

169
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,480
'I want a song from 'Lingaa' sir'

170
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,960
Cut for a minute

171
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,600
Do you have any sense?

172
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,760
'Bloody frauds!'

173
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
'It's all a gimmick'

174
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,920
'What are you staring for?'

175
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,080
'You're not a new recruit'

176
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,960
What was the last new song
our channel got the rights for?

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,480
I begged and somehow got
the film TR sir directed in 1986!

178
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,240
This is the song

179
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,080
And you want 'Lingaa'

180
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,040
As if we can get the rights
of Superstar's film

181
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,200
It will take another 10 years
for us to get this song

182
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,360
I took pity on you and
gave a part-time job

183
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,640
Put that receiver down

184
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,560
Sorry sir

185
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,520
Buffalo, snoring away to glory

186
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,880
You call yourself a director

187
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,600
Make your goddamn call

188
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,440
Let us see who our next caller is

189
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,800
Hello, who is speaking?

190
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,480
Hello!

191
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,480
Don't tell me your name

192
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,840
Our regular caller Kumar
From Trichy, am I right?

193
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
How did you guess, sir?

194
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,880
You are the only jobless
good soul in Trichy

195
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,280
Kumar, tell our viewers

196
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,720
On this good day
at this good time

197
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,160
What is the good news
you want to share?

198
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,800
Please do not lend money
to your friends, sir

199
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,320
My friend borrowed
money from me

200
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,320
Now he's avoiding
my phone calls

201
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,760
Please advise him, sir

202
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,480
Let that mongrel
get enlightened

203
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,280
You are right

204
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,640
Why should I announce that?

205
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,560
I am sure he would
have got the message

206
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,320
Kumar, I'll play for you...

207
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,440
...and the previous callers
Kaveri and Meena

208
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,120
...a song from a film
released last week

209
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,400
A song from a film
released today

210
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,320
Hey! Cut now

211
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,640
Employees, I have to talk
to the director in private

212
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,840
Step out and drink
a free cup of tea

213
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,480
Girls, don't bug your boyfriends
on the phone, come back soon

214
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,720
I would've asked you 10000 times
to borrow Rs 1000 from you!

215
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,200
You're trying to
take a dig at me

216
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,280
Punch you on your nose

217
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,280
Why do you want
loans to be repaid?

218
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,240
Who is this new chap?

219
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,280
He has got wind of
all our company's secrets

220
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
Not to worry, sir

221
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,160
He's our new slave

222
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,680
Still how can we leak
our secrets on the 1st day?

223
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,840
I'll somehow manage

224
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,520
'He's taller than me'

225
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,160
You anchor the program so well

226
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,320
I'm a new recruit

227
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,520
I need your blessings

228
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,760
Just because of
my hair style...

229
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,560
...you think I'm a Godman
who can bless you?

230
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,080
This is Top TV, man

231
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,840
Let me explain the secrets
of our channel, come along

232
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,920
Shall I also come?

233
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,000
Shut up

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You, huh?

235
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,000
Go away

236
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,320
Do you know something?

237
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,960
Students from all colleges
are meeting in Marina beach

238
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,360
They are planning
to conduct a marathon

239
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,640
Go

240
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,440
Don't bug me
early in the morning

241
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,520
But the important factor is
participants are only girls

242
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,120
Girls?

243
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,800
Give you 2 tight slaps!

244
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,280
You think that will make us
stick our tongue out and drool

245
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,120
Of late you are like
the Vijay TV anchor DD

246
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,800
Beating around the bush
and being a bore

247
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,720
Be upfront

248
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,440
What is it?

249
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,720
My friends are coming here
to look for a place to rent?

250
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,840
Should I buy beer?

251
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,120
Beer may not be cool

252
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,320
Will you kindly adjust?

253
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,680
Don't bug me

254
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,080
So many of my friends
have come home

255
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,760
One look at a pretty face
and you dish out a love letter

256
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,200
All of them avoid me
thanks to your habit

257
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,880
I've just joined college

258
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,560
I've made some real good friends

259
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
They are coming home

260
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,800
I don't want you here
at that time, that's all

261
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,400
You've got it all wrong

262
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
I ogle at your friends?

263
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Go, open the door

264
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,080
Your dumbass friends
are at the door

265
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,400
You'll never reform

266
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,160
- Hi Pooja
- Hi

267
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,400
Why are you late?

268
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,360
Traffic

269
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,560
'He looks even at the fish
in the most fishy manner!'

270
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,320
This is my brother, Karthi

271
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,480
Hi 'anna'

272
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,880
'Why is he ignoring them
and walking away?'

273
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,720
'Has he really reformed?'

274
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,880
'Or are these two
too ordinary for him?'

275
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,240
Pooja

276
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,200
Is this Pooja's house?

277
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,840
"Girl with speed of lightning"

278
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,400
"Love in her eyes enlightening"

279
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,840
"Why does my heart swirl and twirl
with just one glance at you, my girl?"

280
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,280
"You landed here
like a Goddess, dear"

281
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,960
"Who are you, princess?
Can I have your address?"

282
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:52,880
"You made me stand within a ring of fire
And you splashed petrol to ignite desire"

283
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,200
"From your love
how will I escape now?"

284
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,440
"Like thunder you struck me
girl, you vanished totally"

285
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,600
"Like rain drops out of the blue
girl, you drenched me anew"

286
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,760
"A war with your looks you waged
My heart like waves rampaged"

287
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,960
"Like a flame you hit me, girl
Killing me in a fiery whirlpool"

288
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,800
"Girl with speed of lightning"

289
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,320
"Love in her eyes enlightening"

290
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,840
"Why does my heart swirl and twirl
with just one glance at you, my girl?"

291
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,800
"You landed here
like a Goddess, dear"

292
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,040
"Who are you, princess?
Can I have your address?"

293
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,520
"Even an earthquake
can't make me shake"

294
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,600
"But a mere bouquet
is making me go dizzy"

295
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,840
"An unaffected heart
by even a bomb blast"

296
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,400
"Your sparkling glances
splinters me to pieces"

297
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,480
"With your velvet soft lips
you slice me to bits"

298
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,360
"Like your pet doggy
you shepherd me"

299
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,800
"Girl with speed of lightning"

300
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,360
"Love in her eyes enlightening"

301
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:03,280
"Why does my heart swirl and twirl
with just one glance at you, my girl?"

302
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,160
"Girls I have seen
More than a million"

303
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,160
"But still no one here
as perfect as you, dear"

304
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,560
"Girls who have seen me
More than a million surely"

305
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,000
"But still I haven't met
anyone so perfect"

306
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,240
"Did God intend to kill me
with your charm and beauty?"

307
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:10,040
"Or did He ask you
to live for me, your beau"

308
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,520
"Girl with speed of lightning"

309
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,240
"Love in her eyes enlightening"

310
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,360
"Why does my
heart swirl and twirl?"

311
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,120
Hiii

312
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,480
What's your little one's name?

313
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,240
Not yet named

314
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,600
Divya...sweetie

315
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,720
'I am a boy!'

316
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,320
Who are you?

317
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,960
At this time of night,
stalking girls?

318
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,840
Pooja...?

319
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,520
Tell me

320
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,800
Why are you
hitting him, sir?

321
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,080
He's ogling at you

322
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
And you're asking us why

323
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,680
He is my brother, sir

324
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,840
You're even ogling
at your own sister!

325
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,080
Our culture has now turned
topsy-turvy, head constable

326
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,240
My dear Divya

327
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,640
Started writing
love-poems, huh?

328
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,920
Don't start this

329
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,840
I want to

330
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,680
Till now only
plain Janes came home

331
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,920
She's the only good looker

332
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,200
I'll write a poem

333
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,160
You give it to her

334
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,240
You wrote to Sumathi

335
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,320
Like poet Bharathi's
'Run around, play, little one'

336
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,560
I can't help it if she is
a 90kg heavy weight champion?

337
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,320
I'm going out now
She'll be your sis-in-law

338
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,520
I love her with all my life
right from my childhood

339
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,480
If she doesn't say yes
you'll see my corpse!

340
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,680
I'll let go of you now

341
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,440
You mustn't hurt me

342
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,160
Ma, your daughter
is bullying me

343
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,800
He always goes around
with a glam doll!

344
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,440
See how tired
the doctor looks...

345
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
...after doing a show
the whole night through

346
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,080
If he himself is so tired,
what about the viewers?!

347
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,440
Good morning

348
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,240
Superstar Rajini is meeting the Press
in Raghavendra mandap tomorrow

349
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,920
To decide whom he should
support in this coming election

350
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,240
Sir, I've not seen him at all-

351
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,760
Please, I'll go

352
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,040
Allow me to finish
You cannot go there

353
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,520
Because they won't let us in

354
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,160
His public relations officer
doesn't get along with our channel

355
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
But next to that venue...

356
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,960
...our man Ramana,
who predicts the weather

357
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,680
...is waiting with powdered face
and without brushing his teeth!

358
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,880
Somehow keep the mike in front
so that our channel logo is seen

359
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,480
Because I've caught hold
of 4 mug advertisements

360
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,080
Only if we get those commercials
can we pay this month's salary

361
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,400
Keep that in mind

362
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,040
As if he will pay

363
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,560
He'll only send us mugs
fit to wash our butts

364
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,680
There's nobody here, chief

365
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,880
Our mike will be the first

366
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,360
Forget the mug, we can
bathe with a bucket!

367
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,320
'Since the depression in Bay of Bengal
is moving towards Andhra Pradesh...'

368
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,320
'...heavy rain is expected
in the coastal regions'

369
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,640
'So fishermen have been warned
not to go into the sea for fishing'

370
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,920
If you can't capture a program on
weather forecast sitting in one place...

371
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,320
...how will you aggressively
cover riots in our city?

372
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,080
If you're like this how will
this channel's rating increase?

373
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,320
How will I get more income?

374
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,680
How can I hike your salary...?

375
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,800
And how can she find
a matching blouse for her sari?

376
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,720
It pains...pains here

377
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,720
Paying high interest loans
my heart is aching

378
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,000
Sir, very sorry

379
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,360
Please forgive me

380
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,880
I'll make sure
it never happens again

381
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,320
'Why is he alone
crying so much?'

382
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,760
'I should also follow suit'

383
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,360
I got this job
after so many insults

384
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,360
Please sir

385
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,640
My sister is getting
married next month

386
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,680
'He'll beat yesteryear hero
Gemini Ganesan hollow!'

387
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,680
So please don't dismiss me

388
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,280
Hey boss...brother...stop

389
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,200
I'm having a royal dig at him

390
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,880
And you're pleading
ever so seriously

391
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,240
Do you have brains?

392
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,360
Your heart aches?

393
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,080
My heart has an attack
working for you!

394
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,520
Look who's talking
Let's quit, boss

395
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,200
Chief, let's hand over formally
a resignation letter before we quit

396
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,120
You think his face is
worthy of such etiquettes?

397
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,320
For someone like him
we must write on a bus ticket!

398
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,480
Even that is too much

399
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,480
We will say it orally

400
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,640
We're quitting
Get lost!

401
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,880
Go...go, boss

402
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,440
Sir, you were too hasty

403
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,200
No one will work for free
other than these 2 brain-boxes!

404
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,360
Call them back

405
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,920
He insulted me in front
of that new employee

406
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,400
Salary...salary

407
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,960
You're right

408
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,240
We have to borrow

409
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
That's why

410
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,720
I can't manage this

411
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,960
Hey...boys

412
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,040
I won't go back even if
he goes on his bended knees

413
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,880
Hello brother

414
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,720
Please...please

415
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,880
I became very emotional
and let my tongue run

416
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,040
Don't take it to heart

417
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,880
So what if we didn't
get the weather forecast

418
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,920
Either a zonal report
or a regional report

419
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,080
We can somehow manage

420
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,240
But please don't quit

421
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,960
No, we can't work here
We are leaving!

422
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,920
Is that so?

423
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,600
Okay, bro

424
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,760
All the best
You carry on

425
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,440
Sir, you only suggested this

426
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,680
Only I should do the build up

427
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,000
You should just shut up

428
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,280
Okay, we won't quit

429
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,760
I'll do my facial and come back

430
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,520
Come

431
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,880
'Why do you need a facial
when you don't have a face!'

432
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,760
Sir, what happened?

433
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,600
I requested, begged and somehow
managed to convince them to stay

434
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,040
Art director is waiting for
his payment downstairs

435
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,560
Will you tell him I've left
for America with my family?

436
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Grandma...?

437
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,160
Who is this boy?

438
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,760
He's your grandson Karthik

439
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,680
My grandson?

440
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,360
Yes

441
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,360
When did you come?

442
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,080
Grandson...?

443
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,240
You look the same grandma

444
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,920
See how smart
my grandson looks

445
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,760
When you were a kid,
with a runny nose...

446
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,920
...and torn shorts
you looked ugly

447
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,840
You’re such a handsome hulk now

448
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,840
Sorry, grandson

449
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,560
I didn't notice
these teenage girls here

450
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,800
You insult me all the time

451
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,640
As soon as I stepped in here
I've stuffed my feet into my mouth

452
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,240
I didn't do it intentionally

453
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,560
Very sorry

454
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,800
Do you know what I've got you?

455
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,760
You would've got me a sweet...

456
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,200
...tasting like dried cow dung!

457
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,200
Not that

458
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,440
(Liquor consumption
is injurious to health)

459
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,440
Granny

460
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,760
What's this?

461
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,040
Your father had bought this
without my knowledge

462
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
I brought it up here
without his knowledge!

463
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,960
He didn't even keep it
in the fridge, fool!

464
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,520
But why have you
got only 1 glass?

465
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,040
Only the inexperienced
need a glass to drink from

466
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,280
I drink it straight from the bottle

467
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,840
Where's my bike key?

468
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,080
It has an opener

469
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,960
You want to open this?

470
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,080
Just watch me

471
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,120
'I should use my grandma
to express my love to Divya'

472
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,440
I already apologized

473
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,280
Why are you still crying?

474
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,240
Grandma, I'm in love with a girl

475
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Rekha, right?

476
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,720
Her name isn't Rekha

477
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,800
But you told me her name
is Rekha over the phone

478
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,200
Her name isn't Rekha

479
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,040
Oh! New chick, huh?

480
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,000
Drink the beer

481
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,720
Call her and whisper
sweet-nothings

482
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,200
I don't even have
her phone number

483
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,640
- Pooja isn't giving it to me
- So what if you don't have it

484
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,840
Don't you have twitter,
whatsApp or facebook?

485
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,440
I don't have any of that

486
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,040
Shouldn't you be advanced?

487
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,240
Okay, don't cry
I'll take care

488
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,560
Drink your beer

489
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,120
Girls these days will even sleep
without their husbands

490
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,800
But not without their phones

491
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,840
I myself can't sleep without
the phone under my pillow

492
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,600
Here...talk

493
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,480
Super, grandma

494
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,800
You got the phone

495
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,640
This isn't Pooja's phone

496
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,400
You think I'm a dumbass like you

497
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,600
I copied on to my phone
all the numbers listed under Divya

498
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,920
After all the trouble I took
why is your face still sad?

499
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,480
There are 10 numbers
listed as Divya

500
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,080
You know how old
she is I presume

501
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,800
How does that matter?

502
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,000
To identify her

503
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,600
You mean by her voice?

504
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,240
Give me the phone

505
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,920
I can get away calling anyone
at this time of the night

506
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,880
I'll call, you try to
identify your Divya's voice

507
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,600
Hello, is Mr Kumar there?

508
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,240
He hasn't come back
from work as yet

509
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,960
Who is this?

510
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,560
Find out from Kumar
He knows

511
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
So you're the one having
an affair with my husband?

512
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,000
Why are you so desperate?

513
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,840
If I ever catch hold of you, that's it

514
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,840
Itch with a b in front!

515
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,200
Your husband is having a ball
only because you're like this

516
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,520
I'll trample you flat out
if I see you face to face

517
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,840
How could you, grandma...!

518
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,320
Hello, I'm calling
from the Ice bank

519
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,560
That's ICICI bank

520
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,240
Whatever it is!

521
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,560
Do you need any loan?

522
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,320
Calling at this hour and
asking if I need a loan!

523
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,640
Don't you have brains?

524
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,360
Do you eat carp or crap?

525
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,480
Disconnect the phone

526
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,240
I think her husband isn't with her

527
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,720
That's why she's frustrated

528
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,600
If you had spoken
she might have hit on you

529
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,880
Hello, who's this?

530
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,840
She sounds sleazy!

531
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,440
Hello

532
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,560
Divya...she's the one

533
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,440
You talk to her

534
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,080
Me?

535
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,520
- Who is this?
- You talk

536
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,840
- Hello
- Hello

537
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,160
Divya, I'm Karthik here

538
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,520
I fell in love with you
the moment I saw you

539
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,160
I'm unable to eat
or sleep without you

540
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,600
Without you, I'll die

541
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,120
I swear on my grandm-

542
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,520
Swear on your grandpa

543
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,520
I swear on my grandpa

544
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,920
Hearing you say all this
I feel like seeing you right away

545
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,040
Will you come home now?

546
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,640
Grandma, she has invited me home

547
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,960
Let's go right away

548
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,120
You've drunk too much

549
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,680
I can handle it
but you can't

550
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,040
So be careful

551
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,560
Why are you tottering
after drinking so little?

552
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,000
Do you know how steady
your grandpa will be?

553
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,280
Grandma, I'll go inside

554
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
Come in only if
you hear any sound

555
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,480
How can I butt in
when I hear noises!

556
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
Won't it be indecent?

557
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,080
You're wicked, old lady

558
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,360
Go, have fun

559
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,720
Just like your grandpa
had a ball with me...

560
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,160
...you also enjoy

561
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,920
Don't worry

562
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,680
I'll uphold grandpa's name

563
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,280
Divu...?

564
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,160
Grandma...!

565
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,400
Hey Pooja

566
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,840
Ages since we met

567
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,000
What brings you here?

568
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,360
I got a call that my brother and
grandma have been arrested

569
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,280
I was told last night
my brother misbehaved with you

570
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,000
But it wasn't intentional

571
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,280
Was that your brother...?

572
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,520
I didn't know that

573
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,040
He's in love with
a girl named Divya

574
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,480
Instead of calling her...

575
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,720
...he called you by mistake

576
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,720
Sorry Divya

577
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,480
If I had known he is
your brother...

578
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,240
...I wouldn't have
arrested him at all

579
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,520
Okay, you can take them

580
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,880
Sorry, sir
You can go now

581
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,520
Don't make wrong calls in future

582
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,120
Did you guys
beat up my brother?

583
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,680
Inspector has gone
on his rounds

584
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,480
I thought I'll start
as soon as he got back

585
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
You came before that!

586
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,720
Had I known this, I would
have come 10 minutes later

587
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,880
Come home, I'll show

588
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,560
Okay, bye

589
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,680
Karthi, don't get
influenced by this old lady

590
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,120
Then you'll end up only in jail!

591
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,600
Don't be silly, you madcap

592
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,960
Look at this

593
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,520
Selvam the neighbor

594
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,760
Selvam the milkman

595
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,880
And Selvam old boy!

596
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,840
Who's that old boy?

597
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,320
He was before
I met your grandpa!

598
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,360
If you save as Divya
without any marker...

599
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,120
...of course anyone
will be confused

600
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,280
Come what may
she doesn't quieten down

601
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
She'll come to heel
only if she walks in the sun!

602
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,600
Start the bike
Let's both go

603
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,000
She can come back walking

604
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,400
You better eat

605
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,520
Enough, ma

606
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,640
Today is only Saturday

607
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,800
Where are you off to
in such a rush?

608
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,240
I'm going to Divya's house

609
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,760
Did you blabber
thinking I'm asleep?

610
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,600
'Where are you off to
without even drinking coffee?'

611
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,040
'Are you following me?'

612
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,360
'Just you wait'

613
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,640
Wretched girl!

614
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,240
For a house so close by
she made me walk 10 streets

615
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,720
I'll deal with you later

616
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,480
My sister Pooja

617
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,400
Pooja

618
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,880
Your brother is here

619
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,320
'Hey dumbo!
I came to see you'

620
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,200
'Even after getting arrested
he hasn't learnt his lesson'

621
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,560
What do you want?

622
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,960
I believe you forgot
your kerchief at home

623
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,320
Mom asked me
to give it to you

624
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,080
As if I can't live
without this kerchief

625
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,600
You better leave
before I tear you apart

626
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,480
Great insult

627
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,120
Pooja, your brother again

628
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,480
What do you want now?

629
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,160
I believe girls like jasmine

630
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,200
So mom asked me to give this

631
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,160
Don't scream

632
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,560
What is your problem?

633
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,720
My brother is a real
roadside Romeo

634
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,400
If he doesn't talk to you today
he won't leave me in peace

635
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,360
Will you talk to him
for 10 minutes, please?

636
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,000
You just want me to
talk to your brother...?

637
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,200
That's all, right?

638
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,360
Come in

639
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,800
'Shameless'

640
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,760
'Scumbag'

641
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,320
Please sit

642
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,840
Sit down

643
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Thank you

644
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,560
I believe you wanted to talk
to me about something!

645
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,840
Go ahead

646
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,080
My name is Karthik

647
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,480
I work for Top TV

648
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,840
I've been living here
all my life

649
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,840
I just want to share
whatever is in my heart...

650
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
...for 5 minutes!

651
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,800
I feel-

652
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,160
Because-

653
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,840
'She has fainted'

654
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,000
'Thank God
No one saw this'

655
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,680
So funny

656
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,320
Don't make fun of me, chief

657
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,080
Guys make girls who give
missed calls as their missus

658
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,920
When she voluntarily
invited you home...

659
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,360
...instead of making her pregnant

660
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,240
...you made her faint!

661
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,200
Very pity
So pity

662
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,960
It's always crowded here

663
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,880
Let's go upstairs

664
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,040
Yeah, sure

665
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,520
Chief, you rent a room
and laugh later

666
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,640
Now do me a small favor

667
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,880
My girlfriend and my sister
are going to the coffee shop

668
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,080
Oh no, I'm not coming there

669
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,440
They'll buy an awful coffee

670
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,720
And sip it for 3 hours

671
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,920
Listen to me, chief

672
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,560
Tell me

673
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,840
I'll first go inside

674
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,960
After 10 minutes,
you walk in casually

675
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,160
And keep looking at my girl

676
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,520
How can you be so indecent?

677
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,280
You're asking me to
hit on your girl?

678
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,960
I'm not that kind
of a person

679
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,600
I like only slim aunties

680
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,880
Forget it, chief

681
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,120
I'll look for another broker

682
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,920
Hey wait! You're directly
branding me as a broker

683
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,200
Okay, you'll go
inside casually

684
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,600
I will join you after 10 minutes
as if it wasn't planned

685
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,360
And praise you sky-high

686
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,080
That's all?

687
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,800
Yes, chief

688
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,200
Hearing you praise me
she should blush

689
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,840
She should fall in love with me!

690
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,880
Okay brother

691
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,520
But we have to make a deal

692
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,440
I'll promote you in this episode

693
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,440
And you must return the favor
in the next episode for me

694
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,760
Hey Pooja!

695
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,080
What a pleasant surprise

696
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,200
How come you're here?

697
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,200
Don't act

698
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,040
As if you didn't
see us coming in

699
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,920
Shut up and
sit somewhere

700
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,960
I must find a chair for Billa

701
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,080
Let me shift this

702
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,760
Why are you taking that chair?

703
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
An auspicious event should
be only in even numbers

704
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,960
You're a kid
You don't know

705
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,720
So keep quiet

706
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,800
Pooja, I got to go, I have
an important job to do

707
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,640
Hello...hello

708
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,920
Before I came, I heard you say
you had 3 hours to chit chat

709
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,800
And now you're leaving
as soon as I join you

710
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,720
Don't worry

711
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,240
I won't open my mouth, sit

712
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,520
Please sit, madam

713
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,880
3 coffees

714
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,960
Don't order as an odd number

715
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,600
Make it 4 instead of 3

716
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,560
Wow! Karthik sir

717
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,840
What are you doing here?

718
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,400
I didn't expect to see you

719
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,040
What a pleasant surprise

720
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
Chief, don't repeat
the same dialog

721
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,800
They might find out our plan

722
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,800
By the way, I'm Billa

723
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,160
Basically Top TV's chief

724
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,840
He works for me
as my assistant

725
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,440
'Why is he getting tensed?'

726
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,560
'He might even cancel
the coffee he ordered for me'

727
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,280
'Let me come to the point'

728
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,680
'Which one is his girlfriend?'

729
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,640
'She looks like an ogress
with tousled hair'

730
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,520
'Can't be his girl'

731
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,040
'She looks bright like
a white washed doughnut'

732
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,720
Sir, is madam your girlfriend?

733
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,800
After actor MGR and
Saroja Devi combination...

734
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,600
...only now I'm seeing
such a perfect couple

735
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,200
When I look at you both
in a tight close up...

736
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,840
...like Cheran and Navya Nair
in the film 'Maya kannadi'

737
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,480
...you both look
made for each other

738
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,120
'Why is he pinching me?'

739
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,360
Maybe the build up
isn't big enough

740
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,320
Sir always talks
about you 24x7 at work

741
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,960
When he eats, sleeps, rolls, itches
he's always thinking about you

742
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,320
You have to marry him

743
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,840
Sincerely yours, Karthik

744
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,640
Hey Pooja, stop

745
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,120
If I boost up your image
you said your girl will blush

746
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,320
Instead my face has turned red

747
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,680
Then what?

748
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,520
That was my sister!

749
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,800
I thought as much
when she looked ugly

750
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,320
She must be his sister

751
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,320
Sir...sir

752
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,160
What?

753
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,280
Planning to apologize
after doing all the damage?

754
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,360
I'm not born in
such a decent family

755
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,800
I boosted you enough

756
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,280
My family has found
a bride for me

757
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
It's your turn now

758
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,800
They know we are here
to formally see the bride

759
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,760
But even so, these bumpkins
will call her only if we ask

760
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,520
So tell them

761
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,160
Oldie, call the girl

762
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,280
The groom wants
to see the girl

763
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,640
Call her

764
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,560
Mini-rhino!

765
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,560
I am the groom

766
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,040
Grandma, I am the groom

767
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,880
Really?
Call the girl

768
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,640
'Why did he come
dressed like a groom?'

769
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,480
'Couldn't he have
worn just his briefs?'

770
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,720
'What a catch!'

771
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,640
Chief, the girl is like a parrot

772
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,800
'Giving away a parrot to the monkey'
Are you quoting that old saying?

773
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,640
No...no

774
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,320
Will I say that about you?

775
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,640
Sweet chocolate

776
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,640
Hi nice blouse bit

777
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,160
So what's next?

778
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,040
Can't we finalize
and go for the feast

779
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,240
Why are you being such a glutton?

780
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,480
Shouldn't we ask the girl
if she likes the groom?

781
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,000
Please favor
my decision, dear lord

782
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,200
Do you like the groom?

783
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,480
God, if the girl likes me...

784
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,600
...I'll walk up to your temple
in just my loin cloth

785
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,760
I like him

786
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,960
Look at him properly

787
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,880
I really like him

788
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,320
As if you are some
renowned optometrist!

789
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,280
Checking her eyes

790
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,440
Shut up and sit tight

791
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,200
Can't you tell by the way
he's whispering to his friend?

792
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,640
That he likes the girl?

793
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,440
Then why wait?

794
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Can't we agree formal-

795
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,240
Wait, I say

796
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,840
We don't even know
where he is working

797
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
And you want
to finalize it

798
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,960
How can you say this, grandma?

799
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,840
I'm chief of Top TV

800
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,760
Yes

801
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,520
You work in Top TV?

802
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,000
- I've seen Sun TV
- I've seen Jaya TV

803
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,560
- I know Vijay TV well
- I've seen Kalaignar TV

804
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,720
We get Malayalam
channels in our house

805
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,320
But I've never seen
your Top TV channel?

806
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,720
We've never heard of this
channel in our city

807
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,960
'Maybe I was too much
in a hurry to express my liking'

808
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,520
'Top TV has put
a full stop to my life!'

809
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,120
How can you not
know Top TV?

810
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,880
Haven't you seen
the talk show at midnight?

811
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,280
A doctor with a goatee beard
and a fat lady discuss X rated stuff?

812
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,720
- Adult TV
- Don't we know that?

813
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,000
Oh! That channel
I like it very much

814
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,000
Billa, look how it's worked out

815
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,560
So shall we finalize it?

816
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,400
I'll slipper you!

817
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,120
You work at a 3rd rate TV station

818
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,000
And you want to
marry my daughter?

819
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Wait

820
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,360
They are aiming at my butt

821
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,040
Boys, wait

822
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,160
Chocolate stuck in my ear

823
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,040
Thank you for saving us from
those barbarians, grandpa

824
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,800
They are all such weirdoes

825
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,440
I'll never forget
your timely help

826
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,720
Throw your gratitude
into the dust bin

827
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,240
Get me an appointment with
the doctor and the fat lady

828
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,840
It's not enough
to spit on his face

829
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,600
Bloody hell...give it to me

830
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,080
At 5:00 a.m in our channel

831
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,880
'Will Jesus forgive you?'
is a Christian talk show

832
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,160
At 8:00 a.m, a gemologist
explains from gravel to brick...

833
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,040
...what gem stones to wear
and where to lead a cushy life

834
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,400
At 9:00 a.m,
in tele marketing...

835
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,600
...they show everything
that goes in and out

836
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,840
Forget all this

837
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,200
After 3:00 p.m,
I myself promote...

838
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,000
...songs from films released
10 years ago as new songs

839
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,680
You forgot all this

840
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,160
And chose a random
randy show at midnight

841
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,960
And spoilt my life

842
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
Wretched fellow!

843
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,160
We went steady for 3 years

844
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
And she ditched me in 3 minutes

845
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,960
Must slice her into two

846
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,160
Chop the girls
and make a pickle

847
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,320
Or they will eat up the men

848
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,480
Heard that?

849
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,040
All these guys have been
let down by girls

850
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,880
She'll keep saying
'I will be behind your victory'

851
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,880
Finally she went
after my friend, Victor!

852
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,240
Hey! Shut up

853
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,800
You keep getting drunk
and deriding us all the time

854
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,640

(Liquor consumption/smoking

895
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,440
"God, for what joy in heaven
did you create women?"

896
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,160
"Our entire clan of men find
there is no peace of mind"

897
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,720
"Such a fearsome aura
Her eyes are like a cobra"

898
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,080
"One look from her
Venom spreads everywhere"

899
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,360
"Her smile is a ruse
Doubles as a noose"

900
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,400
"Caught in it alright
'The end' for us day or night"

901
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,440
"God, you stop the antics of men
with women as your weapon"

902
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,440
"God, having creating women
You're in a Catch 22 situation"

(Liquor consumption/smoking

904
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,960
"Women play 'Saguni'
wrecking men's destiny"

905
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,040

Be on your guard for it to happen"

907
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,440
"If you got money and a car fancy
she'll fall at your feet to be your fiancee"

908
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,920
"Claiming you are her hero
she drains your money to zero"

909
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,040
"Women are thorns who make us suffer"

910
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,880
"Trample those blind poets with fervor
who compare a woman to a flower"

911
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,800
"Girls who are shrews raving mad
Fathers who raised them bad-"

912
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,040
- Dai...fool!
- Sorry, dude

913
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,480
"Tie up the mothers tight
Whip them with all your might"

914
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,440
"All men, no exception
bluff and betray women"

915
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,480
"Is God a man too I wonder
He didn't punish the male gender"

916
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,360
"Is man really bad?
Or a good lad?"

917
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,160
"Not knowing
the girl is suffering"

918
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,720
Just zip your lips and go

919
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,520
Or we'll kill you
and go to jail

920
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,080

(Liquor consumption/smoking

All girls are like this

923
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,000
You'll be locked up
in jail again, lady

924
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,040
Grandson?

925
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,480
Divya is waiting in
the hall, wake up

926
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,640
I don't think
this will work, grandma

927
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,480
You know the chaps who have
all the fun and then ditch them

928
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,920
They will fall for such Romeos

929
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,440
These are dialogs
spoken in my style

930
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,040
Can you talk like this
when you love her truly?

931
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,800
Grandma

932
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,040
All you want to do is find out
if you're in her heart, right?

933
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,840
How?

934
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,200
I'll go to her and say we have
found a bride for Karthi

935
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,560
If her face changes...

936
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,560
...it means you are in her heart

937
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,320
If it doesn't,
it means you're not

938
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,520
Wait, I'll bring tea

939
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,200
So beautiful

940
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,240
Ask me who

941
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,240
Only then I can continue

942
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,400
Who, grandma?

943
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,280
The bride we've found
for my grandson

944
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,280
You found a girl for Karthi?

945
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,640
Yes, dear
We found a girl

946
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,240
They are getting married very soon

947
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,760
Aren't you lying, grandma?

948
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,840
No, I'm telling you the truth

949
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,280
Why are you glum, hearing
about my grandson's wedding?

950
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,200
Nothing of that sort

951
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,800
- I know all about it
- You do?

952
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,120
I'm waiting for you to tell me

953
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,240
It isn't what you think

954
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,840
I fainted after just talking
to him for 10 minutes

955
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,880
Poor girl!

956
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,200
How will she deal
with him for a lifetime?

957
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,880
'Is this why your face changed?'

958
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,120
That's why I feel so bad

959
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,040
If he has bachelor-God's photo
at the door how will he fall in love?

960
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,400
Chief! What a surprise

961
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,760
You didn't pick up my call

962
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,360
Don't lie, chief
When did you call?

963
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,800
Let me come in
for a cup of coff-

964
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,320
Come...come

965
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,120
You mean 'go...go...go'!

966
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,360
Why haven't you come
to work for past 2 days?

967
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,480
I wa-

968
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,480
Hey! Didn't your uncle
get you a job at Vijay TV?

969
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,960
Boss! Please don't forget me

970
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,680
I have 2 coats
my grandpa wore

971
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,800
We can each wear one

972
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,440
And become more popular than Gopinath

973
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,800
Don't ditch me, boss

974
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,520
Forget it, chief

975
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,000
You are pleading like a girl
pregnant and dumped

976
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,680
Why does a man work
like a dog to earn a living?

977
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,040
For a girl, right?

978
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,600
If the girl herself is not in
the picture, why should I work?

979
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,960
I won't come to
office hereafter

980
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,160
How can you give up
our combo so easily?

981
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,560
What happens to me then?

982
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,040
Now what?

983
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,200
You want the girl
to love you, right?

984
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,800
Bring your ear near me

985
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,240
What is it, groom-to-be?

986
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,880
You wanted to talk to me?

987
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,400
But careful what you say

988
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,560
If I end up fainting again,
there's no one here to lift me

989
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,880
Why are you saying this?

990
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,960
Only if a man faints,
nobody cares

991
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,040
If a woman faints...

992
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,960
...everyone from an auto to an Audi
will automatically come to her aid

993
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,240
Why is he talking about
Audis and bodies?

994
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,760
Go ahead and talk

995
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,640
Love is not an exam to fail

996
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,840
It's a feeling

997
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,000
If it is felt once
it can't be changed

998
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,560
Try and re-attach
a wilted flower

999
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,800
You can't

1000
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,280
That's how love is

1001
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,840
For some love is like a plant,
either one or the other

1002
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,640
For some love is like a flower,
if it withers once, that's it

1003
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,320
That's how my love is

1004
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,800
This is my decision

1005
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,520
This may make you sad

1006
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,880
But there's comfort
in that sadness as well

1007
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,720
She's laughing like
comedian Madhan Bob

1008
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,080
What...over, huh?

1009
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,360
Your brilliant brainwave

1010
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,280
Shut up!

1011
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,720
Girls like Vijay's dialogs
even when they just read it

1012
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,120
You've told her face to face

1013
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,640
And she ran away
like a madcap

1014
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,400
Maybe she's an Ajith fan

1015
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,200
Whether she's an Ajith fan
or a table fan...

1016
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,880
...if this route doesn't work,
we'll try another way

1017
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,640
- Who is her best friend?
- My sister

1018
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,880
Will she come if I call?

1019
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,840
I meant to find out
more about her

1020
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,520
Look at this sari

1021
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,800
Isn't he the one who
anchors in Top TV?

1022
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,800
Don't let him go

1023
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,840
I'll call everyone
from our area

1024
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,960
Take that cucumber off
and look at me

1025
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,960
If we put that on her nose,
they'll think she's dead and bury her

1026
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,040
Be quiet

1027
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,000
What did you tell Divya?

1028
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,840
We spoke to her so seriously
and she just laughed

1029
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,000
Nutcase! Why are you
including me in this?

1030
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,240
Is love some joint venture?

1031
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,400
This is why your love
is hanging in midair

1032
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,040
Tell me

1033
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,360
Why should I talk about you?

1034
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,600
Am I mad like you?

1035
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,800
Why did you talk to her?

1036
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,800
'For some love is like a plant,
either one or the other'

1037
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,320
'For some love is like a flower,
if it withers once, that's it'

1038
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,600
'That's how my love is'

1039
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,960
'This is my decision'

1040
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,280
'This may make you sad'

1041
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,640
'But there's comfort
in that sadness as well'

1042
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,040
'Why is she laughing?'

1043
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,040
Why are you laughing?

1044
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,480
This is hero Vijay's dialog
in the film 'Poovae unakkaaga'

1045
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,800
...where he confesses
his love and leaves town

1046
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,520
Will anyone use that dialog
to get her acceptance?

1047
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,680
Jackass

1048
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,440
Gave me a junk idea

1049
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,520
You're abusing him
right in front of him

1050
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,560
He doesn't hear swear words

1051
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,760
I didn't hear anything

1052
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,040
Very nice house

1053
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,440
Oh, how many aunties!

1054
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,400
You've both insulted me

1055
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,480
Look at my long queue of fans!

1056
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,200
My dear babes!

1057
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,640
Hi...!

1058
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,520
Eat properly, kids

1059
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,760
Otherwise I'll send you
to this Top TV boogeyman

1060
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,880
Top TV boogeyman?

1061
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,720
Don't laugh too much

1062
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,000
You look like a dracula yourself

1063
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,840
What...?

1064
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,400
When?

1065
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,840
Where are you taking me
without telling me the news?

1066
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,280
If I tell you,
you'll have a heart attack

1067
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,920
I have no heart

1068
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,680
Shoot, whatever the news is

1069
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,400
Our boss...

1070
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,120
...drank poison

1071
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,520
God is great

1072
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,520
Why are you flustered
if that man drinks poison?

1073
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,480
Then my job?

1074
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,840
What do you mean 'job'?

1075
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,440
I've taught you well

1076
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,120
Your uncle works in Sun TV

1077
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,800
We'll join Sun TV

1078
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,760
I don't even know
the security staff in any channel

1079
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,520
Now I feel like
I'll get a heart attack

1080
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,320
Jesus, save our boss

1081
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,480
Sir, are you a Christian?

1082
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,800
Allah, save me from him

1083
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,760
Where is our boss?

1084
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,240
Give us our salary
and then go up, boss

1085
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,920
What happened, sister?

1086
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,520
Don't disturb the patient

1087
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,680
Why, boss?

1088
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,840
Why did you do this?

1089
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,760
We are here to work
for you for free?

1090
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,280
Why did you do this?

1091
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,680
I started this channel
10 years ago

1092
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,880
Wanting it to develop
through generations...

1093
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,800
...I took a 3 million loan

1094
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,200
Instead the loan developed
and now it's 30 million

1095
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,000
I don't know if this channel
will even last while I am alive

1096
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,760
Your loan will shoot to 300 million
if you don't pay interest

1097
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,800
Do you know how much
India owes the world bank?

1098
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,680
Only people who lend
need to commit suicide

1099
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,400
Why should people who
take loans die?

1100
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,160
Don't talk sense
to a man in ICU

1101
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,840
I'll die

1102
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,200
You talk nonstop
and kill me on TV

1103
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,640
Why here too?

1104
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,560
Karthi, you know something?

1105
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,120
It's been 2 years
since I went home

1106
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,640
Wretched fello-

1107
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,400
Why, sir?

1108
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,400
Did you cheat on your wife?

1109
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,640
What happened, sir?

1110
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:45,280
When I was living comfortably,
my wife was happy with me

1111
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,040
When I lost money,
she left me

1112
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,280
She said I could come home only
if I earn 1 lakh a month

1113
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,800
I can even be
without seeing my wife

1114
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,840
But I can't be without
seeing my 2 sons, Karthi

1115
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,560
It's easy to be poor

1116
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,560
Struggle and live
for any length of time

1117
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,040
But to pretend to be rich...

1118
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,320
...and live a poor life
is hard, Karthi

1119
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,120
That's why
I decided to die

1120
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,360
But even here
I didn't succeed

1121
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,000
This channel isn't lost as yet

1122
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,040
It's only running on loss

1123
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,800
I have a sliver of hope
that you can save it

1124
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,760
I still have hope

1125
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,120
I have hope

1126
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,720
Let's go

1127
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,080
You know what I think?

1128
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,440
He has planned for us to land up
in 2 beds in this same hospital

1129
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,640
He survived

1130
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,120
We are heading
to our graves!

1131
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,200
Why are you crying?

1132
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,120
Our life's chapter is closed, huh?

1133
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,840
(Liquor consumption/smoking
is injurious to health)

1134
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,440
Whether we get our salary
or not every month...

1135
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,040
...this society respects us
only because we hold a job

1136
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,840
We must somehow
preserve that respect

1137
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,760
(Liquor consumption/smoking
is injurious to health)

1138
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,520
Chief, look at that

1139
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,320
Are you saying we should
also die this way?

1140
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,280
No, chief

1141
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,960
This flight accident
happened in 1995

1142
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,760
They interviewed
the people who escaped

1143
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,120
And put up a set as if it's real

1144
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,400
What if we borrow this idea?

1145
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,360
Fat hopes!

1146
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,080
We don't even have
money to drink tea

1147
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,920
Imagine spending on
recreating the event

1148
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,160
We don't need a set, chief

1149
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,240
Just shoot sensational
news in a simple way?

1150
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,480
Idea is very good

1151
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,600
But will it work?

1152
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,000
No harm trying

1153
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,240
Everyone is ready

1154
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,160
Move aside

1155
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,160
Karthi, come

1156
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,600
- Is the camera rolling?
- Yes

1157
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,920
For the 1st time in the history
of Indian television, a 'live' incident

1158
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,680
...brought to you by Top TV

1159
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,000
For the viewers of Top TV...

1160
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,120
...camera man Karthik and I, Billa
risked our lives to bring this to you!

1161
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,560
Sandal wood smuggler Veerappan
was shot few minutes ago

1162
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,480
But our sources are yet
to confirm if he's dead

1163
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,280
We'll know only-

1164
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,520
Oh! The police are here

1165
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,320
Hey! Look

1166
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,480
Veerappan has been shot

1167
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,640
Please zoom in

1168
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,400
Viewers, please remember

1169
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,720
Tomorrow you may
watch this in most channels

1170
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,080
But Top TV was the first
to bring it to your homes

1171
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:57,880
Don't forget

1172
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,160
Karthi, take a close up shot

1173
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,040
Shoot it well

1174
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,880
Lights at the back
should be in the frame

1175
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,080
Checked if the tapes are in?

1176
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,840
Yes, chief

1177
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,960
Don't mess it up

1178
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,320
A warm hello to all our viewers

1179
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,440
Tamil Nadu police, who have been
on their toes to nab Veerappan...

1180
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,360
...somehow struggled
and shot him today

1181
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,680
Repeat what you said just now!

1182
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,560
- Sir?
- Tell me

1183
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,080
Tamil Nadu police, who have been
on their toes to nab Veerappan...

1184
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,720
...somehow struggled
and shot him today

1185
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,400
You think you're Vijay Kumar
Chief of Special Task Force

1186
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,960
Hit him hard

1187
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,960
We paid him and
he was such a bad actor

1188
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,840
You are Azhagu, right?

1189
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,560
You're anyhow busy
acting in TV serials

1190
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,400
Why did you get into all this?

1191
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,800
Don't...don't beat me

1192
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,360
Just because you are both in
the media, I'm letting you go

1193
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,400
Otherwise I'll book you
under drug smuggling

1194
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,600
And make you count bars

1195
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,400
Get lost!

1196
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,760
We were paid peanuts
and he hit us so hard

1197
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,240
Sir...?

1198
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,160
What?

1199
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,080
One doubt

1200
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,200
What is it?

1201
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,280
How did you find out
we are imposters?

1202
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,160
When Mr Veerappan died
he didn't have a twisted moustache

1203
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,680
This guy has a huge moustache

1204
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,720
Isn't this enough?

1205
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,880
As soon as we get out...

1206
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,040
...we must use a brick
and chop his moustache

1207
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,560
What are you muttering?

1208
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,480
Go...run

1209
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,120
How did you find out
about her birthday?

1210
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,480
I didn't tell you either

1211
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,520
If we guys zoom in on a girl...

1212
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,720
...we'll get details, from
the shampoo on her head

1213
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,160
...to the nail polish on her toes!

1214
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,680
Won't we find out her birthday?

1215
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,840
Hello Karthik

1216
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,000
Come in

1217
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,320
What is this?

1218
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,120
You are scared
you'll faint if I talk

1219
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,120
That's why

1220
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,120
I've brought you a small poem
of 80 pages penned by me

1221
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,360
No wonder TR's lyrics books
were strewn all over the house

1222
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,040
You could have killed her
with your nonstop jabber

1223
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,040
Shut up

1224
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,560
Keep chatting

1225
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,960
I'll be right back

1226
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,800
Where are you going?

1227
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,720
She asked me to follow her

1228
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,960
Don't you get it?

1229
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,600
My God!

1230
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,520
"Poets many have penned their muse"

1231
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,560
"Love has never been out of use"

1232
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,160
"Actors, a bevy have floored the viewers"

1233
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,480
"Love hasn't been boring or worse"

1234
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:54,880
"Though so many wars fought
love has so far never lost"

1235
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:01,440
"Though oceans of tears shed
love is bliss whatever said"

1236
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:08,600
"If this love wasn't true
men would be beasts too"

1237
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:14,080
"Love...my life's treat"

1238
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:21,280
"Life...my heartbeat"

1239
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,080
"Heart...my love complete"

1240
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,280
"Poets plenty have penned their instinct"

1241
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,640
"Love hasn't become extinct"

1242

How much is a miscue"

"Whatever it may be
true love blossoms daily"

1246
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:22,680
"Even love that fails drastic
ends up as an evergreen classic"

1247
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:29,040
"Love may begin with lies planted
Even then it's a feeling most wanted"

1248
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,960
"Though Adam and Eve appear
Forsaking love they disappear"

1249
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,160

00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:41,240

King famous in every sense"

"Love hasn't been a boring experience"

1269
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,840
Should I go in or not?

1270
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,840
What are you doing
near the restroom?

1271
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,640
Bathroom?

1272
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,520
Jobless?

1273
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,440
Go...go

1274
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,000
Thank God!
If I had gone in...

1275
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,720
...they would have
pickled me to pieces

1276
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,600
Mahesh, marry me soon

1277
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,880
Understand my plight

1278
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,200
As if I don't want to

1279
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,800
But I'm scared, Vaishu

1280
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,760
Will your parents
accept our marriage?

1281
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:05,080
If they decide to get me married
to anyone else, that's it!

1282
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,280
Why doesn't anyone
understand us?

1283
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:11,560
All lovers like us
sail in the same boat

1284
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,080
How wonderful it will be
if we get our parents' consent

1285
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,720
And get married in front of
all our friends and family

1286
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,400
I wish we had someone
who could convince them

1287
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,320
But who is there
to talk on our behalf?

1288
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,800
Let's try our best

1289
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,840
Otherwise...

1290
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,480
...I'll die

1291
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,880
Heard what she said?

1292
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,480
There's no one to help people
like them who are truly in love

1293
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,440
I heard every word

1294
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,680
Are we director T.Rajendar
to bring lovers together?

1295
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,040
We are ourselves in a quandary

1296
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,240
Billa, why don't we do this?

1297
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,000
What?

1298
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,840
So many have died
because of love failure

1299
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,520
So many are living unhappily
because of their lost love

1300
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,400
Why don't we find true lovers...

1301
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,360
...get their parents to the set

1302
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,840
Why don't we shoot
a show which unites them?

1303
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,120
Karthi, only now
you are thinking!

1304
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,840
We'll do a program
to unite lovers

1305
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,920
Show will be a super hit

1306
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,520
- So my idea is good?
- It's fantastic!

1307
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,440
Then we can advertise in television,
newspaper, radio, all sources, right?

1308
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,280
Yes, we can

1309
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,720
But we'll have a stampede!

1310
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,960
Why don't we start with
these 2 who gave us the idea?

1311
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,520
And unify them first
for sentimental reasons

1312
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,080
They've gone

1313
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,560
This is God's plan

1314
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,960
Even if we want to help them
it isn't working out for them

1315
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Maybe they might have
gone to another bush!

1316
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,440
Bless us, God

1317
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,320
Everybody should face problems
and make a beeline to us

1318
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,560
God, please bless us!

1319
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,640
Chief, it's happening

1320
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,680
Oh lord Muruga!

1321
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,920
Hey! First call
You pick up

1322
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,800
No, you're my senior

1323
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,880
You are our lucky mascot

1324
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,800
You think so?

1325
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,160
Hello Top TV
Who is speaking?

1326
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,120
Sir, I'm Kumar
calling from Trichy

1327
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,800
Tell me your problem

1328
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,680
Sir, I'm sincerely in love
with a girl for 5 years

1329
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,600
But her parents are
not accepting our love

1330
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,360
Only this morning I saw
your advertisement in the paper

1331
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,400
Promising to unite lovers

1332
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,360
- That's why I'm calling you
- What happened?

1333
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,160
Please unite us together

1334
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,960
If you can give us an appointment
we'll come and fall at your feet!

1335
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,840
Fit for the grave
you bloody buffalo

1336
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,160
What are you doing?

1337
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,880
I shouldn't have
hired you for the job!

1338
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,680
You asked me to call whenever
Top TV advertises in the newspaper

1339
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,560
So you'll call, huh?

1340
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,480
Your cheeks will
become like puffed rice!

1341
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,800
Next time if any of you
sit next to him and simper...

1342
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,120
...you'll become like cow dung

1343
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,160
You and your faces
dipped in castor oil

1344
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,320
If you touch the phone,
you'll lose respect!

1345
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,800
Let me repeat it

1346
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,120
If any of you touch the phone...

1347
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,840
...I'll toss you in mid-air
and trample you

1348
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,760
What happened, chief?

1349
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,560
They have the gall
to make fun of me

1350
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,160
Pick up, chief

1351
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,520
You do it this time

1352
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,360
Tell me, who's speaking?

1353
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,360
I'm Murthy from Coimbatore

1354
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,080
Yes, sir

1355
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,240
You telecast Doctor X at midnight

1356
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,600
I feel sleepy around that time

1357
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,040
Is it possible to
telecast it at 8:00 p.m?

1358
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,600
What?

1359
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,360
Our Doctor X program
is at midnight, right?

1360
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,600
I believe he is asleep by then

1361
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,560
Wants to know if we can
telecast it at 8:00 p.m

1362
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,320
He'll see, cover himself
from head to toe and snore!

1363
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,560
As if he'll get up and do
something productive?

1364
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,600
Is sir there?

1365
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,000
Why do you want
to meet him?

1366
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,080
I'm a folk artiste

1367
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,120
Sir asked me to register
the dance-drama and bring it

1368
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,080
I've brought it with me

1369
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,720
You mean the drama
in which actors...

1370
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,320
...with long braids and
layers of make up overact

1371
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:13,160
If you play such dramas these days
even my grandma won't watch

1372
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,440
Our channel didn't take off
only because we showed...

1373
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,720
...all this X rated stuff

1374
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,640
Your dance drama will
shut it down once for all!

1375
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,600
Please leave

1376
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,600
Yov! Get-

1377
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,440
Get lost...!

1378
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,160
Before we hit you,
leave this place

1379
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,560
Do you know who he is?

1380
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,760
What do you know about the folk art?

1381
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,200
'Koothu' isn't
just entertainment

1382
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,680
It talks about the history and pride
of our language and our ancestors

1383
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,440
It has made so many people
laugh, cry and win

1384
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,400
Do you know how many have
learnt life's lessons from it?

1385
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,120
Today they telecast Ramayana and
Mahabaratha on TV in DTS sound

1386
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,160
Throughout the year

1387
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,040
Does anyone understand
anything at all?

1388
01:05:55,080 --> 01:06:00,360
But even a kid watching this art
will know our entire history in 3 hours

1389
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,760
If a drama artiste gets
dressed to play a role...

1390
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,280
...until the curtain call
he won't eat or drink

1391
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,880
But in today's world...

1392
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,400
...the life and career of many
actors will end in a caravan

1393
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,680
Who said it is overacting?

1394
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,000
Actors today make use of
dubbing, re-recording, effects

1395
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,600
Still when we watch the film...

1396
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,880
...we have no clue
if he is laughing or crying!

1397
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,000
But a drama artiste when
he acts on a small stage...

1398
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,880
...whether he stammers or murmurs
in a gathering of 500 people

1399
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,280
...the 501st man will be
able to hear him crystal clear

1400
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,920
That's the specialty
of our ethnic drama

1401
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,800
And he is an artiste
to reckon with

1402
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,680
For the sake of this dying art
not only this gentleman...

1403
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,960
...but an entire village is starving
without food or water to drink

1404
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,280
Mani 'anna',
ignore these two

1405
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,840
I've also been wanting to do
something for this glorious art

1406
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,720
But no one respects it

1407
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,160
If a girl dances
wearing skimpy clothes...

1408
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,840
...owners from jewelry to grocery store
will line up to give commercials

1409
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,280
But if I go...

1410
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,120
...forget it

1411
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,560
Sorry, 'anna'

1412
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,680
Is there a whole village
dependent on this art?

1413
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,640
Yes, son

1414
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,880
Don't worry about anything

1415
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,520
Just take us to that village
We'll take care of the rest

1416
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,600
Okay

1417
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,200
Chief, I have an excellent idea

1418
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,760
Why should we go
looking for lovers?

1419
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,080
Let's create them

1420
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,360
What are you saying?

1421
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,440
My dear village folks

1422
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,440
It is said, if you ask
it will be granted

1423
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,000
And if you knock,
the door will open

1424
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,240
But here you don't
have to ask or knock

1425
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,320
Opportunity is landing
at your own doorstep

1426
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,880
For how many years will you starve
trying to make ends meet with this art?

1427
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,560
You must change
according to the times

1428
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,400
With a little bit of
brain and so-so looks...

1429
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,720
...you can also be
a Rajini or Kamal!

1430
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:49,000
The time has come for the world
to recognize the actor dormant in you

1431
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,720
My jaw is aching
Your turn now

1432
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,560
We've now distributed
yellow and green papers

1433
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,800
Ladies, please memorize
the dialogs on the green paper

1434
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,520
Men, yellow paper is for you

1435
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,000
Give us a soooper performance

1436
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,640
Even an average act will
still fetch you a job in Top TV

1437
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,560
This is a chance
of a lifetime to act

1438
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,800
My dear citizens of Kutthambakkam

1439
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,720
We will now start the audition

1440
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,600
Men and women
form separate lines

1441
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,520
'Manohara, rise and shine'

1442
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,120
'You have your
moth...mother's support'

1443
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,960
You rose like smoke too!

1444
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,040
You are selected

1445
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,360
'Manohara, bury these monkeys
in the plantain groves'

1446
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,120
'Those who jeered never lived
Those who lived never lost'

1447
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:26,840
'Don't sneer'

1448
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,640
You don't jeer

1449
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,520
Selected
Go

1450
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,160
We have got it
Start, your majest-

1451
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,840
Your mouth is sprained, move

1452
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,520
'My moustache is twitching'

1453
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,960
Bro, learn your dialog

1454
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,200
'Who are you demanding
taxes and interest from?'

1455
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,760
'Are you the notorious
Jackson Durai?'

1456
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,520
'To the girls who play in those fields
did you grind turmeric paste?'

1457
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,320
'Shameless fellow!'

1458
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,200
What's your name?

1459
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,360
Tamannaah

1460
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,560
Does your dad know that?

1461
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,000
'Manohara, enough of being tolerant'

1462
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:47,840
'Rise and shine'

1463
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,560
'My dear son
Obeying your moth-'

1464
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,480
Go inside

1465
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,360
'Sky showers rain
Earth grows it grains'

1466
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,640
We don't want you...go

1467
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,520
Hey! Listen
I was good

1468
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,760
Why are you rejecting me?

1469
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,040
I'll chop you...chop you

1470
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,560
Why are you getting tensed?

1471
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,000
'Shameless man!'

1472
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,520
'Who are you asking to
pay taxes and interest?'

1473
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,120
Super...super
Please go, bro

1474
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,000
'Are you the notorious
Jackson Durai?'

1475
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,520
Go

1476
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:18,880
What is your name?

1477
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,480
Tamil Selvi

1478
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,120
Your parents never
fed you properly?

1479
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,400
First put on some weight

1480
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,600
'Let these iron shackles crumble'

1481
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,040
'Let this pavilion crush
to powder...to dust'

1482
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,160
'Whom are you asking to pay tax?'

1483
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,800
'Did you grind turmeric paste?'

1484
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,200
'Shameless man!'

1485
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,040
'Is he scolding me?'

1486
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,200
'Were you the one
who called me?'

1487
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,000
Deliver your dialog

1488
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,080
Hey! Stop

1489
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,240
I can't deliver any dialogs

1490
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,520
I'm a big rowdy in this area

1491
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,000
If you don't give me a chance...

1492
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,720
...no one can leave
this village alive

1493
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,760
Okay, you go

1494
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,760
"Confront the challenge"

1495
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,960
"Partner, let’s re-arrange"

1496
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:04,680
Stop

1497
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,840
Don't stand in the sun

1498
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,480
"We’ll be famous hereafter"

1499
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,040
Are you related to her?

1500
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:09,840
No

1501
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,240
Then why are you glaring!

1502
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,840
"Fear as a word shouldn’t appear"

1503
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,080
Open your mouth
and show your head

1504
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,800
You got hair
all over your body

1505
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,440
Take one whole day
to cut all this...go!

1506
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,960
How do you think
you qualify?

1507
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,280
Egghead!

1508
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,040
What, grandma?

1509
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,120
Can you do a bob cut?

1510
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,040
Get lost...run away

1511
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,600
"We can slash
thunder in a flash"

1512
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,520
"We can break open the sky"

1513
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,240
"Victory is ours, high 5!"

1514
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,400
"Even if a short cut we take
it isn’t a big mistake"

1515
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,200
"The finishing line of your journey-"

1516
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:36,960
I can't do this

1517
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,880
This mug isn't enough
for these buffalos!

1518
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,240
"Plan and be thorough
Chase your tomorrow"

1519
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,040
"If roadblocks appear
be brave, don’t fear"

1520
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,440
When will you apply make up?

1521
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,000
You already
look like a ghost

1522
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,520
"Take the litmus test head on"

1523
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,360
"Who can defeat us, partner?
We’ll be famous hereafter"

1524
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,080
"Pit your wits"

1525
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,440
"Buddy, get maximum hits"

1526
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,880
Do a moue with your lips

1527
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:01,840
Not like that

1528
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,480
'Father'

1529
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,760
'Mother'

1530
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,080
'Girlfriend'

1531
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,200
'Grandmother'

1532
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,320
'Aunt'

1533
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,360
'Brother'

1534
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,920
'Girlfriend'

1535
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,400
Who gave you this?

1536
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,280
I took it myself

1537
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,680
With 1 foot in the grave...

1538
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,120
...you want a girlfriend's role?

1539
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,040
You better take it off

1540
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,160
I won't, sir

1541
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,680
Then will I be
your partner?

1542
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,680
Okay

1543
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,920
Karunakaran told me everything

1544
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,320
I'll give you money

1545
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,560
You do the program

1546
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,840
Thanks, madam

1547
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,360
Wondering why I immediately
agreed to lend you money?

1548
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,640
Karunakaran has borrowed
several lakhs from me

1549
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,720
He pays the interest promptly

1550
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,120
But hasn't paid anything
towards principal amount

1551
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,880
I believe if you do
a program uniting lovers...

1552
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,480
...you'll make huge profits

1553
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,680
He has promised to repay
the loan with that show

1554
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,880
He is asking me to help
with this last one

1555
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:03,920
I can

1556
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,440
He's dark

1557
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,840
I hope he won't lie!

1558
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,280
Yes, madam
He is very dark

1559
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,800
What the hell, man?

1560
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,720
Why are you being a nag-nag?

1561
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,040
This is your last breath!

1562
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,400
Hey! Pick up this mongrel
and drag him away

1563
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,760
Don't get me wrong

1564
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,800
If the loan isn't repaid,
this is my reaction

1565
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,560
Young boys who got into real estate
used actors to promote their product

1566
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,000
They have risen
to a high level

1567
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,400
That's why I'm going to be
the producer of your program

1568
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,160
And move to the next level

1569
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,440
Only you can fulfill
this Anjali's desire

1570
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,880
Okay, please get going

1571
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,440
Bring the next debtor

1572
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,800
Hi Mummy

1573
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,840
Hi Sweetie

1574
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,560
Muah...go

1575
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,720
If Urvasi dances
so gracefully now...

1576
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,080
...imagine how she would
have danced in her youth

1577
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,440
Please come in

1578
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,440
Only you can make
this program a success

1579
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,760
Please say yes, madam

1580
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,080
If this cheating comes to light...

1581
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,440
...the Press and TV
will tarnish my name

1582
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,920
I can give you
an idea if you like

1583
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,960
Quit this loser channel

1584
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,360
And produce the sequel
to 'Mundhanai mudichu'

1585
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,440
I can offer to act for free

1586
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,080
'She'll act for free, but audience
will have to pay and suffer'

1587
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,680
Why is he looking
so sheepish?

1588
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:31,120
In that film, you and Bhagyaraj sir
got united, it ended on a happy note

1589
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,800
Then how can we take part 2?

1590
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,200
So what if it's a happy ending?

1591
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,080
The last scene finishes
with our wedding night

1592
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,120
In the story we are
blessed with a daughter

1593
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:39,960
That's me

1594
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,320
You are free
to dole out dates

1595
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,880
But Mr Bhagyaraj is very busy

1596
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,040
So what?

1597
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,680
His son Santhanu is really
keen on working with me

1598
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,120
I can get you his dates

1599
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,040
What do you say?

1600
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,760
Ma'am, somehow do this

1601
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,560
Good program

1602
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,760
Our boss is already in the ICU

1603
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,920
If he hears about this news...

1604
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,480
...he'll go straight
to the cemetery

1605
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,640
Please say yes, madam

1606
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,880
That's impossible

1607
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,200
Listen, if you're interested
in doing a film let me know

1608
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,120
I can even reduce
my payment by a few lakhs

1609
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,440
Don't come to me instead for
this TV program, cheating etc

1610
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,360
I beg you not to get me
involved in any of this

1611
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,560
Why?

1612
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,440
Have they already left?

1613
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,960
- Get up
- Please say yes

1614
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,240
Please think about it, madam

1615
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,840
Your close friend Meena
fell in love with someone

1616
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,200
But couldn't marry him

1617
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,680
She has married someone else
And is having a hard time

1618
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,880
If someone like us
had united them...

1619
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,800
...imagine how happy
she would be now

1620
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,320
Hey chief, how do you
know Meena's love story?

1621
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,920
She's also sobbing
hearing your story

1622
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,680
Is it Kamal Hassan's dream film
Marudhanayagam that I won't know?

1623
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,760
Every heroine would have
gone through this stage

1624
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,560
Especially a heart throb like Meena

1625
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,360
You saw that girl's photo outside, right?

1626
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,920
What's your flashback saying?

1627
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,840
You made my heart melt by
sharing my friend's ex-love story

1628
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,480
What happened to her...

1629
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,120
...shouldn't happen to anyone else

1630
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,200
I'll agree to be in your show
for that sole reason

1631
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,960
Thanks for saving our boss

1632
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,960
It's not an easy task to
make village folks act

1633
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,160
It's very difficult

1634
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:12,120
We need a director with
a good commanding power

1635
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:12,960
He can suggest-

1636
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,120
No, you go ahead
and suggest, madam

1637
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:19,080
We have a permanent person to don
the director's role in Tamil cinema

1638
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,040
How many times have I told you...

1639
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,840
...not to give the phone
to me when I am shooting?

1640
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:24,920
Do you have any brains?

1641
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,880
He's in a shot

1642
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,280
He is yelling
at his assistant

1643
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,840
Sir, check if this position is fine

1644
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,960
This is the position
I'll speak from here

1645
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,560
Focus...is the focus okay?

1646
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,280
Shall we go
for the take?

1647
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,040
Kanchana...!

1648
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,480
Where are you running?

1649
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,520
I'll catch you, stuff you
in a quarter bottle

1650
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,400
Then if I don't dissolve
and drink you...

1651
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,720
...I'll change my name myself

1652
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:45,720
In Kanchana part 2...

1653
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,520
...you whipped and
washed me, right?

1654
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,120
See what I'll do
to you in Kanchana 3

1655
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,360
Watch me in action

1656
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,160
See how I seek my revenge on you

1657
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,680
Sir, is it fine?

1658
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:55,680
Okay, sir

1659
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,240
Thank you, director sir

1660
01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,920
How was it?

1661
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,960
Why are you doing this?

1662
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,320
Only if I do all these gimmicks
will my market improve

1663
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,480
And so will my payment

1664
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,440
Get that in your head

1665
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,920
He's acting in Kanchana 3

1666
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,160
Looks like he's busy

1667
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,960
If he's busy,
disconnect

1668
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,440
That chameleon will
give a build up for nothing

1669
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,680
If he's busy, he will
ask more, leave it

1670
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,920
Watch me now

1671
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,160
Hello

1672
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,960
Line got disconnected

1673
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,360
Is this also gone?

1674
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,680
They should call us back

1675
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,400
You don't call them

1676
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,880
If we call them of our own accord
they will assume we are jobless

1677
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,720
Got it?

1678
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,680
You don't even know
what to say when

1679
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,520
In front or behind the camera

1680
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,520
And you call yourself a director

1681
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,360
Why haven't they called back?

1682
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,440
Selvam, come here

1683
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,240
I got a call from a company
few minutes ago

1684
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,440
Did they call me back?

1685
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,120
- Not yet
- Okay, forget it

1686
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,160
Do you know their address?

1687
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,880
We can go and ask
for a chance directly

1688
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,640
No, I don't

1689
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,560
You call yourself a man
and on top of it my manager!

1690
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,120
Shouldn't you have
got his address?

1691
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:07,960
Go now

1692
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:10,600
Switch it on

1693
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,960
'Where are you running?'

1694
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,880
Started again

1695
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,440
I won't leave you

1696
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,720
'I'll catch you, stuff you
in a quarter bottle'

1697
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,800
'Then if I don't dissolve
and drink you...'

1698
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,720
'...I'll change my name myself'

1699
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,560
Sir, come here

1700
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,400
Why do you yell as if
you've gobbled a speaker?

1701
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,040
We've received
10 calls till now

1702
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,200
You claim they will call back
But none of them do

1703
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:36,120
If you had shaped your story well
we would be big shots by now

1704
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,800
'Maybe I overacted?'

1705
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:46,160
Very nice to see all the characters
sorted out with boards hanging

1706
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:46,920
Super

1707
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,440
Whose idea was this?

1708
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,040
Sir, mine
How is it?

1709
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,000
Extremely good

1710
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,200
When you could do all this
you could've directed too

1711
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,760
Why me?
See you

1712
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,080
Sir, please come

1713
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,760
You select the actors yourself, sir

1714
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,880
'With such a scrawny body
he acts so pricey!'

1715
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,680
Shall we separate
the characters?

1716
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,280
We've already done that

1717
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,960
Won't you subside?

1718
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,440
Go and get me juice

1719
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,960
Cluster bean juice?

1720
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,120
Junk of a jerk juice!

1721
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,920
Get me 2 glasses
apple juice with ice

1722
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:12,720
Right now

1723
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,520
Maa, I'm leaving

1724
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,640
Pooja, I'll get going

1725
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,800
Hello

1726
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,320
All this is ancient

1727
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,520
How much ever you yell
she won't come out

1728
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,000
Go do something useful

1729
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,800
Don't glare...go

1730
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,320
Let's welcome Mrs Urvasi

1731
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:44,600
Here she is, give her
a big round of applause

1732
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,480
Shall we start?

1733
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,040
Welcome

1734
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,920
On behalf of Top TV,
sponsored by Anjali Promoters...

1735
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
...this is your Urvasi presenting
'My golden moon of nectar'

1736
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:02,440
This program is the 1st of its kind
in India, in fact in the whole world...

1737
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:06,240
...where lovers are united
with their parents' consent

1738
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,720
It's a very unusual program

1739
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,840
And more than that
a very essential show

1740
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,000
Today in our studio
we have a pair of lovers

1741
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,640
Let's listen to their problem

1742
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,640
Welcome to this show

1743
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,360
What's the problem
with your love?

1744
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,240
We've been in love
for the past 3 years

1745
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,200
His parents are refusing
to accept our love

1746
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,520
I can't live without him

1747
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,160
I prefer to die
if I don't marry him

1748
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:29,960
Don't cry, dear

1749
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,560
They can only stop us from living

1750
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,520
But they cannot
stop us from dying!

1751
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,920
Please stop crying

1752
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,560
I can't bear to see you cry

1753
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,080
Did you see that, viewers?

1754
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,040
See how much
they care for each other

1755
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,040
And how deep
their love is

1756
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,720
But both sets of parents
are opposing their love

1757
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,920
What can be the reason?

1758
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,080
Let's find out

1759
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,720
First ask this girl's father to come

1760
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,720
I'm not coming

1761
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,400
Why?

1762
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,200
You asked me to act
as Gomathi's father

1763
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,520
And I accepted because
she and I are not connected

1764
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,160
But I love this girl

1765
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,120
If I accept to be her father...

1766
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,040
...then I'll never get the chance
to act as her husband in this life

1767
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,280
I can't do it
Please leave me

1768
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,040
I'll kill you

1769
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:05,680
Go right now

1770
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,040
Karthik, let go of him

1771
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,840
How can you understand his agony?

1772
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,840
More than the pain the grandma felt
after losing the fritter to the crow...

1773
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,920
...do you know the trauma of the crow
after losing the fritter to the fox?

1774
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,640
Only the youth of Tamil Nadu
who lose their love to someone else

1775
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,480
...will feel this pain

1776
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,680
He's blabbering something

1777
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,400
Go inside

1778
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,480
Remove the board

1779
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:24,480
Go in

1780
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,400
Don't, sir

1781
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,760
You are that girl's father

1782
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:31,720
Sit over here

1783
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,480
Why did you go and
sit so close to her?

1784
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,200
Come this side

1785
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,600
Please take your seat

1786
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,480
Tell me, why are you
opposing their love?

1787
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:46,080
"Cage a koel and make it sing
This is our world's way of dealing"

1788
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:51,120
"Break the legs of a peahen
And make it dance to their tune"

1789
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,880
Sir, I asked you a question

1790
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,200
And you started to sing!

1791
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,920
Why are you against their love?

1792
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:57,920
Just answer that

1793
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,720
If you cheat on your husband
and have an affair with another guy

1794
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,240
And elope, will your
husband accept that?

1795
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,720
Let me know
if he'll accept

1796
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,840
Then I'll also accept

1797
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,720
Do I look like a simpleton?

1798
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:08,840
Tell me, madam

1799
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,240
He's the girl's father, right?

1800
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,520
Natural for him to be
hurt and disappointed

1801
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,200
Let's come back after
a short commercial break

1802
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,400
You did very well

1803
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,400
Use the restroom and
get back immediately

1804
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,920
For this program
to be rated high...

1805
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,640
...you're even crying
without any glycerin

1806
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,840
I am so proud of you

1807
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,000
Hey, don't irritate me

1808
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,200
My husband has gone abroad now

1809
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,440
That's why I escaped

1810
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,280
What would've happened
if he had watched this program?

1811
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,360
Remove all these microphones

1812
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,800
Why do you fall at my feet
at the drop of a hat?

1813
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,120
Okay, I'll do, fine

1814
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,480
Welcome

1815
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,320
Let's get back to the program

1816
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,840
Parents from both sides are here

1817
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,600
Let's first question
the girl's mother

1818
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,000
Welcome to this show, madam

1819
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,760
You look like a very
compassionate person

1820
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,480
What's the reason for not accepting
the boy your daughter has chosen?

1821
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,440
What is stopping you?

1822
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,560
We don't know his caste
Or his family background

1823
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,080
How can I say 'yes' to this
scumbag with no identity?

1824
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,480
Caste...caste...!

1825
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,560
Did you watch the recently
released film 'SMS'?

1826
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,160
In that film, my son Jiiva will
love a girl from a different caste

1827
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:11,080
I'll myself meet the girl's father
and bring them together

1828
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,080
I'm acting with Jiiva again
in another film

1829
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,000
Also with Arya
and Vijay Sethupathi

1830
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,360
In fact for Power Star-

1831
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,080
Madam, is this a press meet
to glorify yourself?

1832
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,000
Go back to the show, madam

1833
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,120
So it's the caste factor
that's stopping you, right?

1834
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,600
Tell me, what's wrong with this girl?

1835
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,080
What does she lack, for you to
find another girl for your son?

1836
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,000
I want a family ready to
gift a grand trousseau

1837
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,360
I'll look for a family willing to
give a car, bungalow, garden

1838
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,560
And all the comforts

1839
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:36,240
Stupid female!

1840
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,800
That dialog should be crisp and clear

1841
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,200
Look at the way she's messing it!

1842
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,040
She's asking for dowry
right in front of you?

1843
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,080
Do you know demanding
a dowry is a big sin?

1844
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,800
It's illegal, a crime

1845
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,200
They'll put you in prison

1846
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,680
They might arrest us

1847
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,240
Let's try to resolve this peacefully

1848
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,640
We are living for our son

1849
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,880
Not for society

1850
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,160
Let's solve this amicably

1851
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,000
Accept it...accept her

1852
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,600
Please forgive me, madam

1853
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,360
Influenced by my relatives
I lost my head

1854
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,760
True pearls of wisdom!

1855
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,080
Are you okay with it?

1856
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:04,040
I'll be happy only if
my daughter is happy

1857
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,680
If 2 families discuss
with each other...

1858
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,040
...all problems can be resolved

1859
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,480
Please bring the garland

1860
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,720
Garland her

1861
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,080
This episode should be
very sentimental, Karthi

1862
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:15,680
- Your girlfriend's name?
- Velankanni, madam

1863
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,040
Velankanni?
Take it off

1864
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:17,720
3 years

1865
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,080
You've been dating for 3 years

1866
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,560
Your parents are here, right?

1867
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,280
Why are you opposing that love?

1868
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,320
Who are you to interfere?

1869
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,480
Should we listen
to you at once?

1870
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,560
Sir...sir...please sit down

1871
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,120
I have a disability
only with my legs

1872
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,480
Chief, why is he feeling so bad?

1873
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,200
If he is emotional
then he is the father

1874
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,960
I'll definitely get him married, madam

1875
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:36,640
Dumbass!

1876
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,600
Why do you look at me
and ask this question?

1877
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,640
Look at the camera

1878
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:40,800
Please bring the garland

1879
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,400
I've just sent Govind
to the cemetery

1880
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,840
There's no dead body ready
to get the garland from!

1881
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,960
Get up, hug and then fight

1882
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:51,720
"Who can defeat us, partner?
We'll be famous hereafter"

1883
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:52,720
Let go of his hair

1884
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,800
The wig might come off

1885
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,600
"Come, leave a blazing trail"

1886
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:59,600
"Fear as a word shouldn't appear
Fling it aside and burn to a cinder"

1887
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,880
"All 8 directions will be east to us"

1888
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,800
If he hits me like this,
I refuse to act, sir

1889
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,640
As if you did an Oscar
winning performance!

1890
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,280
Get lost, sir

1891
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,480
Everything is resolved

1892
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,360
Garland her

1893
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:09,240
Go ahead

1894
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,920
Cut the camera

1895
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,200
Hold the garland
I am leaving

1896
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,040
"Victory is ours, high 5!"

1897
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,040
"Even if a short cut we take
it isn't a big mistake"

1898
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:18,920
Our beloved boss!

1899
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,400
"The finishing line of your journey
is the boundary for your destiny"

1900
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,400
Why did you get pictures of
celebrities who are not a couple?

1901
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,800
What vehicle is this?
Looks like a tin car

1902
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:29,840
I won't get into this

1903
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,160
It's 'dream-girl' car

1904
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,440
Aren't you coming?

1905
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,920
We'll be in a scooter
ahead of you

1906
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:34,840
Get there in 1 piece

1907
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:38,040
"Who can defeat us, partner?
We'll be famous hereafter"

1908
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,920
"Top up the challenge"

1909
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,000
"Friend, be the change"

1910
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:46,440
"Fear as a word shouldn't appear
Fling it aside and burn to a cinder"

1911
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,080
Did I act well, madam?

1912
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:51,480
You ripped it apart, including
4 good dialogs in between

1913
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,560
Why are you sending egg
and frying pan in together?

1914
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,160
He might end up
making an omelette

1915
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,720
Only if you put them together
their chemistry will work out

1916
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,560
Mano, I've been wearing
the same sari for past 7 episodes

1917
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:02,640
Let me change and come

1918
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:05,240
If you keep changing as you wish
we'll end up begging!

1919
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,000
Mano, this is not
going to work out

1920
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:07,920
It's already 6:00 p.m

1921
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,600
I've a baby and husband
waiting at home

1922
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,800
Can I be acting all the time?

1923
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:11,680
Okay, fine, clear out

1924
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,800
Tata, see you

1925
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:21,120
"Relics of the past, throw away
Not needed now anyway"

1926
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:25,040
"To lead a life checking almanac
we are no cowards in fact"

1927
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:29,120
"Wads of money we need
It will never be extra to exceed"

1928
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,280
Call this girl's boyfriend in

1929
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,880
Only one of you
can be the lover

1930
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:33,680
You get out

1931
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:36,760
"We don't benefit in any way
following justice and fair play"

1932
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,400
"A few wrong turns don't matter
Victory is what we are after"

1933
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,440
"Sky is no burden to us"

1934
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,400
"Earth is no big distance"

1935
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,920
"We'll carry on our crusade
Join our fiery brigade"

1936
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,360
"Even if a short cut we take
it isn't a big mistake"

1937
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,520
"The finishing line of your journey
is the boundary for your destiny"

1938
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,880
"Plan and be thorough
Chase your tomorrow"

1939
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,960
"If roadblocks appear
be brave, don't fear"

1940
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,440
Flashing your teeth
at all the girls

1941
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,400
If I ask you to go...

1942
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,840
...you're standing
like a buffalo

1943
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,120
"Rise to the occasion
Create a sensation"

1944
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:10,920
"Who can defeat us, partner?
We'll be famous hereafter"

1945
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,880
"Dare the deal, friend"

1946
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,080
"Defend till the very end"

1947
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:18,720
"Fear as a word shouldn't appear
Fling it aside and burn to a cinder"

1948
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,200
Cry...some more

1949
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:22,520
Like this

1950
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,600
Madam, you should only-

1951
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,680
Keep crying and lean
on your father's shoulder

1952
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,480
Hug her and pat her head

1953
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,480
Don't cry
I'm here for you

1954
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,800
If I ask you to pat her head...

1955
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,520
...you're making a pass at her

1956
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,720
You're her father,
you wretched lech!

1957
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,360
If we tell you to sob,
you're sniffing your nose

1958
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,920
In the film 'Mahanadhi'
Kamal sir cried so realistically

1959
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,160
Only then you'll melt
the hearts of our viewers

1960
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,960
If you can't cry
then cover your face

1961
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,640
And shrug your shoulders
like actor Cheran

1962
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,440
That can pass off as crying

1963
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,960
Hey! What are you doing?

1964
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,200
Teaching her the dialog, sir

1965
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,920
Think you're director Bharathiraja?

1966
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,840
Please ask the girl to come

1967
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,400
How long to wait?

1968
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,400
You sent in a pregnant girl

1969
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,560
I can't do such programs

1970
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,400
I'm going home

1971
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,680
Madam, this is dummy

1972
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,040
Oh! She's taken off her tummy

1973
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,680
"Don't worry about society
Relatives are a nonentity"

1974
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,520
"Till our last breath, let's run"

1975
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,400
"Carry no worries, none"

1976
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,360
"No room for tomorrow"

1977
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,240
"We won't be born again, bro"

1978
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,080
"Seize the moment, carpe dium"

1979
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,840
"Let our show gather momentum"

1980
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,480
"Even if a short cut we take
it isn't a big mistake"

1981
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:24,760
Please take your seat

1982
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,800
You do all kinds of stuff
in the name of God

1983
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,080
I'll do black magic
and tie you up

1984
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,080
This isn't the usual love marriage

1985
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,360
This girl and boy won't
have any more problems

1986
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,280
Because God will always be
with good hearted people

1987
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,600
What, sir?

1988
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,840
I want to tell you something

1989
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:39,560
Tell me

1990
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,920
You asked me to
pretend to love her

1991
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,680
But I sincerely like her now

1992
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,800
Talk to her on my behalf
and please get us married

1993
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,440
Are you serious?

1994
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,040
I'll take care of her
And make sure she is happy

1995
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,520
I can do it, madam

1996
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,080
That's a big step on your part

1997
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,880
This is the happiest moment
for me as anchor of this show

1998
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,080
What do you feel, dear?

1999
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,120
If he's confident about
protecting me...

2000
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,240
...I accept, madam

2001
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,720
That's wonderful to hear

2002
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:05,960
Go stand there

2003
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,040
Come and witness
an original marriage here

2004
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,960
You've been doing
only dummy marriages

2005
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:11,840
Come here

2006
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,480
Are you really
getting the 2 married?

2007
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,640
What do you mean by really?

2008
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,280
So far you enacted
only fake weddings

2009
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,160
Witness a divine wedding now

2010
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,840
Garland her

2011
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,200
Bless the couple

2012
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,720
Let me find a wife soon
because of this good deed

2013
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,120
Be happy

2014
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:34,680
Bless me too

2015
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,240
I fell at your feet
out of sheer habit

2016
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,480
Do you have brains?

2017
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,480
During the audition...

2018
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,640
...I asked you
if you can act

2019
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:41,720
You nodded your head

2020
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,320
After that whenever I asked you
a question, you nodded your head

2021
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,680
Why didn't you open your mouth?

2022
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:46,520
Sir, don't hit him

2023
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,000
Tell me why you didn't speak

2024
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,640
Program hasn't started?

2025
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,760
It's already late and
you are busy yelling at him

2026
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,800
A small mistake

2027
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,320
What is your goof up this time?

2028
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:59,600
I thought he would be right
for the father's character

2029
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:00,480
And chose him

2030
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,880
But if he opens his mouth
he sounds just like a female!

2031
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,200
Because you chose him
for the father's role...

2032
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,400
...I gave the weekend off
to the rest of the actors

2033
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,160
Now you're saying
his voice isn't suitable

2034
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,360
And you brag all the time!

2035
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,280
We must go 'live' now

2036
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,560
You call yourself a director?

2037
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,320
Please don't humiliate me

2038
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,880
You don't worry

2039
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,080
In 'Pammal K Sambandam'...

2040
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,360
...hero Kamal Hassan is born
and brought up in Chennai

2041
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,440
He couldn't deliver
these mythical dialogs

2042
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,880
So that director gave him
loads of bubble gum to chew

2043
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,400
Said he would take care
of the dialogs while dubbing

2044
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,840
Didn't the viewers get it?

2045
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,840
In the same way
let him talk whatever

2046
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,200
We'll take care of it in dubbing

2047
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,200
You are deriding
my directorial skills instead

2048
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,440
What do you think of yourself?

2049
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,600
This is a 'live' show

2050
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:36,720
Stop arguing

2051
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,480
Mano, I made a mistake
recommending you

2052
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:41,080
Every day you do
some mess up

2053
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,200
I can't waste my time

2054
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,960
They're waiting for me
in the shooting spot

2055
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:44,920
I'm leaving

2056
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,840
Why do you readily
fall at my feet?

2057
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,240
That mistake won't happen again

2058
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,080
Let's not argue

2059
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,040
I'll dub

2060
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,120
Please sit down, madam

2061
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,360
Do something then

2062
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,200
Get everything ready

2063
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,640
Are you all ready?

2064
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,320
'That necklace looks great'

2065
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,160
'Should flick it for
the next show'

2066
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:05,200
This is a sad scene
where you should cry

2067
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,160
If you wear such dazzling jewelry,
it won't match the emotional content

2068
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,760
Govindaraju, why do you
give glittering accessories?

2069
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:11,840
It doesn't gel well

2070
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:12,800
Take it off

2071
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,640
Come and take it soon

2072
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,120
Please give it to him

2073
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,880
Keep it safe

2074
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:18,920
I'll ask for it later

2075
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,760
I'm in love with this girl
for the past 4 years

2076
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:21,800
My dad isn't willing

2077
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,160
You must only
somehow unite us

2078
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,480
How long will you memorize?

2079
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,280
You've been reading this from
7:00 a.m as if it's some exam

2080
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,720
I'll read it one last time

2081
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,080
No...no
Time's up

2082
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,560
Govindaraj, take it from him

2083
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,000
Welcome

2084
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,520
On behalf of Top TV,
sponsored by Anjali Promoters...

2085
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,600
...this is your Urvasi presenting
'My golden moon of nectar'

2086
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,000
We'll see you again after
a short commercial break

2087
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,880
Sir, please cut it

2088
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:46,480
What?

2089
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,680
Program has just begun

2090
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,320
You're announcing
a break already!

2091
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,240
Since this program started
I haven't got a hike in my payment

2092
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,440
Your boss comes
in the morning

2093
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,760
And leaves before we wind up

2094
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,800
Now he came, wished me
and vanished into thin air

2095
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:59,240
I can get him
only if I go after him

2096
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,720
Please continue the program

2097
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,360
I'll make sure
you get paid more

2098
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,840
In my dreams

2099
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:04,680
Okay, fine

2100
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:05,880
Sir, please go

2101
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,840
You want me to start and
stop whenever you wish

2102
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,760
Your attitude sucks

2103
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,280
Please go, sir

2104
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,760
'My golden moon of nectar'-

2105
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,000
You missed out
on 'Top TV'

2106
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,240
I can say Top TV only after
I receive the payment

2107
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,240
Keep quiet
Don't interrupt me

2108
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,720
Let's go directly
to our program

2109
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,000
Share your problem with us

2110
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,880
I'm in love with this girl
for the past 3 years

2111
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:25,960
Her family has accepted

2112
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,520
But my father isn't willing

2113
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:28,920
'You have to cry'

2114
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,520
Madam, my name is Suresh

2115
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,440
I'm in love with this girl
for the past 3 years

2116
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,920
Please unite us somehow

2117
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,080
Punch 2...camera 2

2118
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,440
Chief, my girlfriend
is coming here it seems

2119
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,200
If she comes here
she'll know this is rigged

2120
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,480
My love will go for a toss

2121
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:47,080
When the father character talks
give me a line in my head phone

2122
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,760
I'll dub from outside
and manage

2123
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,760
Chief, wave your magic wand!

2124
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:51,880
It's a question of my life

2125
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,040
You mess up your love
even when luck favors you

2126
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:54,760
My fate!

2127
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,560
Hey incense stick!

2128
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,240
Connect that lady's voice to his ears

2129
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:58,400
Urvasi's voice?

2130
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:01,960
The father you selected
who speaks like a female

2131
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,160
Hello Karthik

2132
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,200
Hello madam

2133
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:10,560
Do I look like 'madam' to you?

2134
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:13,000
Karthik, I want to say
something to you

2135
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,160
Uncle, please listen
to me for 10 minutes

2136
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:16,960
Should I listen to
whatever you say?

2137
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,560
Why are you so angry?

2138
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,520
I was wrong to have
kept you dangling...

2139
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,200
...without understanding you

2140
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,600
But you know what?

2141
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,120
My parents like you a lot

2142
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:27,920
Enough if your parents consent?

2143
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,280
Shouldn't I like you?

2144
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,120
That girl is sobbing her heart out

2145
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,040
Can't you relent?

2146
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,120
She can cry all she wants

2147
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,520
I can't accept it

2148
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,240
Please hear me out, Karthik

2149
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:41,600
Don't come near me...go

2150
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,200
Don't come near me

2151
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,720
Go...go

2152
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,000
Why don't you like me, Karthik?

2153
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,000
Why do you hate me, uncle?

2154
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,600
Why do you hate me?

2155
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:54,920
Don't you look at your face
in the mirror every day?

2156
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,840
Let me tell you this frankly

2157
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,960
I love you, Karthik

2158
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,240
Chief, show has really
warmed up very well

2159
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,360
Make the audience pulse hit the ceiling
with a vehement 'no' as punch line

2160
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,440
Can't

2161
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:20,600
I can't

2162
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,680
Even if you stand upside down, I won't

2163
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,240
Hello, sir!

2164
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,400
I'm Divya's friend

2165
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,320
We both study
in the same college

2166
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,040
I believe Divya knows you

2167
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:45,600
She asked me to meet you

2168
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:48,480
You're doing a show
to unite lovers, right?

2169
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,760
We love each other

2170
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,360
Only you can unite us both
through this program, sir

2171
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,800
We are both in love
with each other

2172
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,880
But both our families
are opposing our love

2173
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,840
You should only
bring us together

2174
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,280
Please help us

2175
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:03,840
I'll unite you both

2176
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:05,360
Come

2177
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:08,480
We'll go there and talk

2178
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:14,600
The guests in our
25th show will be...

2179
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:16,040
...Ilango's son

2180
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,280
And Samudrakani's daughter!

2181
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,840
The whole of Tamil Nadu
will be in a state of shock

2182
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,800
Show has to be really super

2183
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,520
Of course, we'll rock

2184
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:25,680
Madam, call for you

2185
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,400
An important call

2186
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:29,400
I'll be right back

2187
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:30,040
Ok madam

2188
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:33,120
'My golden moon of nectar'
program's producer here

2189
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,240
For our 25th show,
Mr Ilango's son...

2190
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,400
...and Mr Samudrakani's
daughter are participating

2191
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,600
If we do this program...

2192
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:45,200
...we'll get revenue
through advertisements

2193
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,640
You are sir's personal assistant

2194
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,280
If we don't let him know,
it will misfire

2195
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,600
Can you please find out?

2196
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,960
'If this program is telecast
I'll kill all of you'

2197
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,720
Madam, they are both not
as ordinary as you think

2198
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:58,600
Especially in the last election
Samudrakani forged the votes

2199
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:01,560
When 3 officers caught him
he killed them in the voting booth!

2200
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:02,800
At least he turned
into a rowdy

2201
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,840
But Ilango is a rowdy
from the day he was born

2202
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,600
Heading the caste association...

2203
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,720
...he beheaded 13 men
by creating riots

2204
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:11,120
Until now he has
killed 48 people

2205
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,640
I believe he intends
killing 2 more

2206
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:13,880
And celebrate golden jubilee

2207
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,440
Let us not be
those 2 targets of his

2208
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,760
No need, madam
They won't agree

2209
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,160
If they don't agree, it's okay

2210
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,000
Anyhow we'll shoot this program

2211
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:22,200
We'll make a lot of money
through this program

2212
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,600
Poor Karthik and Billa

2213
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:25,920
They will be killed

2214
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,080
If they don't shoot this...

2215
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,480
...we'll shoot them!

2216
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,320
What are you saying?

2217
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,440
Did you really hear
that lady say this?

2218
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,520
I had gone to the restroom
while she was on the phone

2219
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:36,760
She has decided to kill us

2220
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:40,120
You're saying it casually
like tonsuring one's head in Tirupati

2221
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:44,680
That lady has sent her henchmen

2222
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,840
Kill them

2223
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,200
Quick!

2224
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,960
They'll kill us
Run faster

2225
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,240
They are cornered

2226
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:00,680
Do you have the key?

2227
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,160
Today is an auspicious day

2228
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,760
You shouldn't resort to violence

2229
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,320
Trying to play God
with my boss's daughter?

2230
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,640
Blood...?

2231
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:18,680
No

2232
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,000
'Drink your tea'

2233
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,880
Hey boss! Only solution is to
run away from this place

2234
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,800
Yes, chief, let's leave this place

2235
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,560
But what about my Divya?

2236
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:33,080
More boys have died
for a 'figure' than for sugar!

2237
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:34,160
Do you have any sense?

2238
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:35,040
It's your call

2239
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:36,520
Collect the money
for tea from him!

2240
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:37,600
Okay, chief, carry on

2241
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:39,800
Remember the agreement
with that real estate shrew?

2242
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:40,920
We can escape today

2243
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,640
But one day she will
hound us and kill us

2244
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,680
What are you saying...?

2245
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,240
Chief, there's only 1 solution

2246
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,400
If we unite them, we can
ensure this show doesn't happen

2247
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,560
We can easily escape

2248
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,960
Karthik, you trust
that chap too much

2249
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,400
He'll definitely let you down

2250
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,280
Wait and see

2251
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,280
Here he comes

2252
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:06,680
Your fare

2253
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,520
Why has he brought a hammer?

2254
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,800
- You are unable to lift it
- Okay, go

2255
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:21,280
Why have you
brought a hammer?

2256
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:23,120
Haven't you watched
the film 'Kanthaswamy'?

2257
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,280
When actor Vikram goes to raid...

2258
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,600
...he'll always carry
an identical hammer

2259
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,640
He threw that hammer
at the audience!

2260
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,240
His body is strong enough
to carry a hammer

2261
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,920
You weigh 3.75 kilos
less than the hammer!

2262
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,640
You're unable to even
balance your back!

2263
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,280
Then why moan and
groan to carry it?

2264
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,040
Return it, sir

2265
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,360
You are yourself bent crooked

2266
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,520
And you're advising me, huh?

2267
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,640
Are you some big shot
Oscar winning director?!

2268
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,360
He fell down

2269
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:45,840
Sir, bring that body

2270
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:46,600
Let's go

2271
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:47,600
Come, sir

2272
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,760
Ouch! My arm!

2273
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,480
Don't forget we are Income tax
officers from the Central Govt

2274
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:56,200
We will speak in Malayalam
so that he doesn't suspect us

2275
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,840
(Speaking in Telugu)

2276
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,800
If he asked you to
become Mohanlal...

2277
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,880
...why are you
becoming junior NTR?

2278
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,400
But why speak in Malayalam?

2279
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,840
We can easily cheat them
only if we speak in Malayalam

2280
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,760
Our folks here believe
Malayalis are intelligent

2281
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,880
They can assume that

2282
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:09,760
But I won't

2283
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:10,840
Knock on the door

2284
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,720
Goddess in Kerala, help us!

2285
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:22,400
These men seem to be
ready to pounce on us

2286
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:25,840
Hi 'cheta'
Good afternoon

2287
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:26,840
Who are you?

2288
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:27,600
What do you want?

2289
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,600
We are income tax officers

2290
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:30,400
Income tax?

2291
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:34,080
Looking at your nose,
I think you doubt us

2292
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:36,080
Take a look
at my pan card

2293
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,720
My expired credit card

2294
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,840
My old voting card

2295
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,200
Also I possess a sim card
with no money

2296
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,360
Okay...please, sit

2297
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,440
I'll join you
in a moment

2298
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,040
What are you looking at?

2299
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,800
Sir, at least now you believe in us

2300
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:52,480
Go upstairs
and do your job

2301
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,280
I'm a director

2302
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:55,840
Are you teaching me
how to direct?

2303
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,640
I'll only be here, move

2304
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,920
Shut up, man
Everybody is watching

2305
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,200
I'll pay you promptly
Please go up and check

2306
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,160
I'll do it for you...move

2307
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:09,160
Showing my expired
credit cards and sim cards...

2308
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,200
...I'm claiming to be
an income tax officer

2309
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,280
And he buys it
without batting an eyelid

2310
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:16,160
Our people vote
for such a dumbass

2311
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,120
Our dream of India
becoming a superpower...

2312
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,880
...will only happen
in movies, I think

2313
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,840
Out of curiosity
whom did you vote for?

2314
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,360
I also voted for him!

2315
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:25,840
Please sit

2316
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:27,120
Sit

2317
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:28,520
Tell me

2318
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:30,080
'Cheta' I'm a Malayali

2319
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,720
But you don't
know Malayalam

2320
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,720
So I will speak both
in Tamizh and Malayalam

2321
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:35,680
Is it okay, 'cheta'?

2322
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,240
'Why is he calling me 'cheta'?

2323
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,640
'Maybe he found out
about my humble beginnings'

2324
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,240
Why are you confused?

2325
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:42,280
No...nothing like that

2326
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,440
Shall I start
my questions?

2327
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:44,920
Gopi, ready with the camera?

2328
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,400
Do you like Taj Mahal or not?

2329
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:51,480
What's the connection between
a politician and Taj Mahal?

2330
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:54,040
Sir, when I showed you
my card and spoke in English...

2331
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:55,480
...you didn't say anything!

2332
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,120
But if I speak in Tamil
you're angry?

2333
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:59,040
Cheta sir, attack him in English

2334
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,720
No...it's okay

2335
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,480
Please speak to me in Tamil!

2336
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:03,680
Do you approve of love or not?

2337
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:07,120
Sir, there's money in this bag!

2338
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:09,440
'There is 5 million here'

2339
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,200
'I should make up some
excuse and manage'

2340
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:13,680
If that's the case,
go and check again

2341
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,880
You mango pit!
I'll kill you

2342
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:16,760
Please go

2343
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,280
I'm also human

2344
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,120
I also empathize
with people's problems

2345
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,720
I approve of love marriage

2346
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:22,640
In fact this month...

2347
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:24,440
...I'm getting 100 lovers married

2348
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:25,520
On behalf of the party!

2349
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,520
The 5 million he seized was given
by volunteers for such a noble cause

2350
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:29,840
Question No 2

2351
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,080
If your daughter is
in love with someone...

2352
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,920
...you'll be okay, right?

2353
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:38,560
Your thought, intention
and question are all wrong

2354
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:42,240
My daughter will never
make any blunder like that

2355
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:46,720
Question No 3

2356
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,920
If your daughter is
in love with someone...

2357
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,400
...and if someone like us unites them
what will be your reaction?

2358
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,520
I'll slice them

2359
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:56,760
I feel very sorry for your
daughter and son-in-law

2360
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,840
I didn't mean
my daughter or her lover

2361
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:01,320
But the ones
who unite them

2362
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:03,040
Even though it's an old dialog...

2363
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,240
...he means it

2364
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:05,160
I'm petrified

2365
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,000
Before he acts on
his words, let's escape

2366
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:08,800
So who will you choose
as your son-in-law?

2367
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,800
I'll get her married to
an industrialist's son

2368
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,840
Provided they ask for
my daughter's hand formally

2369
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:14,280
I don't go back on my word

2370
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:15,720
No one can change me!

2371
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:19,560
When you spoke on the stage
you promised to unite lovers!

2372
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,520
Now you're going back
on your promise

2373
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:24,160
What I promised
was for lovers

2374
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:25,360
Not my daughter!

2375
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:26,520
How's that?

2376
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,160
Question No 4

2377
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:31,280
If your daughter falls in love with a boy
from a family with equal status...

2378
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:34,160
...like Mr Ilango's son,
will you accept the alliance?

2379
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,200
He is my biggest enemy

2380
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,800
He has murder cases
piled against him

2381
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,280
When he goes out
with his family...

2382
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,360
...the police are waiting to
kill him in an encounter

2383
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,400
What if my daughter
goes with him and is killed?

2384
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:43,760
Therefore a vehement NO

2385
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,320
Sir, I found this sack
full of documents!

2386
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,840
I think all the contracts and tender
details of Tamil Nadu will be there

2387
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,120
God hasn't let us down

2388
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,520
If it's a sack
full of documents...

2389
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,160
...there's sure to be
something fishy

2390
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,320
We can blackmail him and
make him accept their love!

2391
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,600
Why don't you say it
with a smile?

2392
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,320
Your idea sounds fine

2393
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:03,320
But I'm shivering inside

2394
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,480
Shall we have coffee
and then continue?

2395
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,520
Can we have coffee
and then continue?

2396
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:08,720
Oh sure!

2397
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,160
Bring a cup of coffee for sir

2398
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:13,560
We must watch siren Shakeela's films
and learn Malayalam properly

2399
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,120
Hey! Is the coffee hot?

2400
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,480
Do you have any common sense?

2401
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,360
You bloody dog,
swine, mongrel

2402
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:21,880
You shameless junk of a jerk!

2403
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,000
'He's fluent in Tamil'

2404
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,600
If I see you again,
I'll shove you into the gutter

2405
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,560
Hey...!

2406
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,000
'My Tamil has blown our cover'

2407
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:30,520
Slice all 3 necks in one blow

2408
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:32,560
This is only a dummy knife, right?

2409
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,720
You're holding a smaller knife
on the actual 2 culprits

2410
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,720
Why such a big one
around my neck alone?

2411
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,960
You kept saying
I'll let you down

2412
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,120
But you blew the whistle!

2413
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:44,200
When there's a knife at my neck
are you stabbing me with words?

2414
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,560
I smell something burning!

2415
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:48,080
If hot coffee is
poured all over me...

2416
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:50,120
...naturally it will
get burnt to embers

2417
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,720
Bring another tea
and pour on his-

2418
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:53,680
Shut up!

2419
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,800
Dad, please leave them

2420
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,640
I won't do anything
against your wishes

2421
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:00,920
Please let them go

2422
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:01,960
Don't cry

2423
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,800
Don't cry, Vaishu

2424
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,200
I can't bear to see
my daughter cry

2425
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:09,880
That's why
I'm giving in

2426
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:12,680
Get out

2427
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:13,960
You heard him

2428
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:14,960
Take the knife off

2429
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,160
Let's scoot

2430
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:16,880
Run fast

2431
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
If I see you guys
anywhere again-

2432
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,080
Hands up!

2433
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:21,880
He has murdered
so many people

2434
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,600
And sitting here
like a Ganesha doll!

2435
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:25,320
Where have you
all disappeared?

2436
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,960
Come here...fast

2437
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,120
Hey...stop

2438
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,760
We are CBI officers

2439
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,720
Who are these men?

2440
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,720
They're my guests attending
a function in my house

2441
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,840
Is this gym-body your guest?

2442
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:41,000
They all look like trouble makers

2443
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:42,640
You better clear out

2444
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:43,400
I'm scared

2445
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:44,520
Oh no...I hate crowds

2446
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,560
You are flashing your teeth
We'll kill your boss

2447
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:47,760
They are allergic to you

2448
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:48,760
Leave now

2449
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,320
Go...go

2450
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:53,600
They are pointing
a gun at my forehead

2451
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,200
Sit down, I don't
want to shoot you

2452
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,160
You got a gun in your hand

2453
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:58,840
Playing a game
of 'robber-police'?

2454
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,000
I'll also join you, please

2455
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:00,800
Shut up

2456
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,040
Junior comedian Aarthi

2457
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:03,440
Looking like a sand bag

2458
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:04,600
What did Veda Miss tell you?

2459
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,440
Go to your room and see
Connexions on Vijay TV!

2460
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:07,720
I know everything

2461
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,800
Shut up your bloody mouth,
black monkey

2462
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:11,680
Give me that gun?
I'll 1st shoot this kid

2463
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:12,760
Go inside

2464
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,720
Going overboard

2465
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:14,680
Ripe grapefruit!

2466
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:16,200
Chief, sit there

2467
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,920
Camera man,
come and set it up

2468
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,360
Notorious rowdy

2469
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,640
- Pasi
- Kasi

2470
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:25,600
Is he Kasi or Pasi?

2471
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:26,560
Kasi

2472
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:30,000
Kasi was shot and
killed an hour ago

2473
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,200
We feel you are somehow
involved in that death

2474
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:33,520
Sir, that's so unfair

2475
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,760
People will bad mouth freely
How can I accept all that?

2476
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:37,960
I am hearing about this
only through you

2477
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,120
Mr Rowdy, you're lying

2478
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:42,400
Your friend's daughter
was in love with Kasi

2479
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:45,400
On your friend's request,
you killed Kasi

2480
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:46,400
Am I right?

2481
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:47,400
No...never!

2482
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:48,320
Accept it, sir

2483
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,960
You can never
escape from the CBI

2484
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,080
'Because I made fun of her, is she
planning to pour acid on my face?'

2485
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,080
Forget that

2486
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,080
One small help

2487
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:55,960
If you don't mind...

2488
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:56,960
He's my friend

2489
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,680
He is in love with
a girl for a long time

2490
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,520
He has also been
trying to ditch her

2491
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:01,400
He has failed so far

2492
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,640
You should only help him!

2493
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,600
You're already there
Isn't that enough?

2494
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:06,880
'This is CBI's way of
fishing out information'

2495
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,640
'If I say I don't advocate
love marriage...'

2496
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:10,880
'...they will at once confirm
I'm involved in this murder'

2497
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,120
'I will handle it differently'

2498
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:14,080
I think you got me wrong

2499
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:16,280
Look at me properly
I'm not that kind of a person

2500
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:18,120
Then you'll accept
if your son falls in love?

2501
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,240
If he falls in love with
some politician's daughter...

2502
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,400
...you'll agree, right?

2503
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,320
I swear I won't

2504
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:24,040
Then I am sure
he has only killed Kasi

2505
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:27,280
Why are you hell bent on
calling me a murderer?

2506
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:29,040
I have my own reasons
for opposing this

2507
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,320
Because my son loves a girl...

2508
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,800
...and someone in her family
disapproves and commits suicide

2509
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,680
And if their relatives also
commit suicide seeing this

2510
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,400
How traumatic it will be
That's why I am against it

2511
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,000
You think you are
being very smart!

2512
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:41,200
Give you 2 tight slaps

2513
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:42,680
Is your son God's gift to mankind?

2514
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,160
Whom will you
get him married to?

2515
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:46,960
I'll look for a traditional girl
who will fit into my family ideally

2516
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,400
Can you buy her in Ratna stores?

2517
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,520
A girl who will adjust
to my family's needs

2518
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:54,880
One who doesn't take my son to
live with her in her parents' house

2519
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:00,160
'Why is this little devil
looking at me intently?'

2520
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,360
'Come out, I'll exorcise
you with neem leaves'

2521
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:05,960
'Where is she running to
every now and then?'

2522
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,480
There are many murder cases
pinned against you

2523
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,120
There's only one escape route

2524
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:20,480
He's the ruling party leader

2525
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,320
If you get your son
married to his daughter...

2526
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,160
...then I'll take care
of everything

2527
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:25,480
Turn around

2528
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:27,600
Everything is over, sir

2529
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:30,240
That pumpkin kid
saw me in Top TV

2530
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,560
And reported me
to these goons

2531
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,640
All your ideas involve
risking my life

2532
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:39,000
I know their house
Can I go bring them?

2533
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,240
They gate crashed

2534
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:41,920
And threatened me
with a dummy gun

2535
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,280
And you offer to
bring them back

2536
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,480
Go and kill them

2537
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,120
If you do something stupid...

2538
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,360
...our son might do
something drastic

2539
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,960
Have you forgotten
that we fell in love too?

2540
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:54,400
After all he has your genes

2541
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,800
If you still continue
to create problems...

2542
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,520
...you won't see
both of us alive

2543
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:00,600
That's it

2544
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,280
Okay, don't cry

2545
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:06,320
I love him
as much as you do

2546
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:08,120
She'll get her way
shedding a sea of tears

2547
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,600
Don't hurt those boys

2548
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:10,760
Let them be...go

2549
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:11,840
I agreed, right?

2550
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,960
Why are you still sobbing?

2551
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,720
- Go inside
- Let's go, son

2552
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:19,680
Sir, our channel
has only 1 camera

2553
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:22,800
Karthik, no one has ever
escaped alive from those rowdies

2554
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,120
Our good luck we got away
because of family sentiments

2555
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:28,040
Hereafter we shouldn't go and
talk to them or meet them anywhere

2556
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:30,040
Karthi, slow down

2557
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:33,520
'My golden moon of nectar' program'

2558
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:35,360
'Family feud between
Tamil Nadu's politicians'

2559
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:38,240
They have 6 hours
to see this poster

2560
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,640
Before that enjoy everything
you wanted to till you are 60

2561
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:46,040
You can keep my pocket money and
this is the cash I stole from my mother

2562
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:49,560
For your good heart
you'll be killed in just 1 blow

2563
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:50,480
Don't be scared

2564
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:52,200
Go, boss
Only 6 hours left

2565
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,560
Why are you
asking me to go?

2566
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:54,440
Aren't you coming?

2567
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,920
Only your face
is on the posters

2568
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:56,640
Really?

2569
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,080
World is a sphere
Please turn around

2570
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:02,480
Who's that?
Looks smart, just like me

2571
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,720
Oh gawd!
It's me

2572
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,360
What is this?

2573
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,680
'The star hero of the show
who will host the coral jubilee'

2574
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,160
'Congratulations
Manobala'

2575
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:12,840
'I know you wouldn't have
done this out of goodness of heart'

2576
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,440
Tear it...tear it down

2577
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:16,840
Normally when you
give them 1000 posters...

2578
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,040
...they will only paste 100

2579
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:18,880
But my bad luck...

2580
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,520
...they've stuck them all

2581
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,720
At least you've posed
with your arms folded

2582
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:24,040
So you have
grace time 6 hours

2583
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:25,360
But I'm waving
my hand joyously

2584
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,680
I have only half an hour

2585
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,840
Before I land up in Pattaya
I think I'll end up on a bier

2586
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:30,880
Give me the cash

2587
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:33,040
Before I die I must
drink chilled beer

2588
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:35,280
Chief, I've decided

2589
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:36,600
Let's not stay in this place

2590
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:37,560
Let's go elsewhere

2591
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:38,240
Really?

2592
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,240
Only Divya will think
about me and suffer!

2593
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,480
What rubbish, she'll suffer

2594
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:43,440
Send her a 'hi'
from your new sim

2595
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,520
She'll ask 'who are you?'

2596
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,800
Then she'll ask
'where are you?'

2597
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,200
Then she'll send
'let's meet'

2598
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:48,760
The next chapter
in love will begin

2599
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:49,600
Divya it seems!

2600
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:50,760
Let's go

2601
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:53,040
They might close
the liquor shops by 10:30 p.m

2602
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,920
Hey, bad omen
A mortuary van

2603
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,200
Chief, that's an ambulance

2604
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:57,120
Is that so?

2605
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,800
I'm scared of anything
and everything!

2606
01:48:58,880 --> 01:48:59,960
Hey chief!
Don't lament

2607
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:00,720
Let's go

2608
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,080
Any sound reminds me of
the funeral conch in my ears

2609
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,320
Start...start

2610
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,760
'After 10:00 p.m
it is girls' time'

2611
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:19,400
'They'll keep texting and
calling anyone and everyone'

2612
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:21,280
'Must turn off his phone'

2613
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,120
Our life is in danger

2614
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,160
And you're meddling
with your phone now

2615
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:28,960
Who is calling me now?

2616
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:33,120
You switched off my phone
and now you'll flirt, huh?

2617
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:34,480
I just want to see who-

2618
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:41,240
Are they threatening us
over the phone?

2619
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,160
Where are you running?

2620
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,800
Tell me and go
Let me also come

2621
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:45,840
Wait

2622
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,160
Don't escape alone

2623
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:53,000
I'll also come along

2624
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,880
Why did you come running
in such a flustered state?

2625
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,600
Oh! You love me
so much, right?

2626
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:16,000
You love giving love letters
to all the girls you meet!

2627
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:18,520
But when you heard
I was getting married...

2628
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:20,560
...I'm glad you got so agitated

2629
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:22,800
I'm not like that anymore

2630
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,480
I love you truly

2631
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:27,080
If you feel so intensely, being
in love with me for just 6 months-

2632
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:28,720
Hey! Come out

2633
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:33,080
'God of death, Yama
usually comes on a buffalo'

2634
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:35,160
'But He has come
in an Audi car!'

2635
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:36,640
They've been in
love for 3 years

2636
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:37,680
How will they feel?

2637
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,720
Doesn't she have
money or good looks?

2638
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,440
What does he lack?

2639
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:45,520
For all the problems they faced
they could have split up long ago

2640
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:46,880
But that is not love

2641
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:47,880
It is called frenzy

2642
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:50,320
Heart will be
bursting with love

2643
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,440
But because of the fear
of not being united...

2644
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:56,200
...many lovers haven't
expressed their love!

2645
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,960
For all of them your program
has given positive energy!

2646
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,400
So many suicides
have been prevented

2647
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,520
You've planted hope
in so many hearts

2648
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,840
And now who are you
running away from?

2649
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:11,280
To unite lovers,
the right mindset is required

2650
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:14,120
I fell in love with you
only because of that mindset

2651
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,520
Seeing you escape
I realize only now

2652
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,480
You united those lovers
with just money in mind

2653
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,160
You united lovers
by enacting dramas

2654
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,760
You're now scared to
bring genuine lovers together

2655
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,040
After listening to her, you might
have decided to unite them both

2656
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,720
Because you're a hero

2657
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,400
All the very best, Karthik

2658
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,480
Good luck for the show

2659
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:38,480
I'm leaving

2660
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:39,440
Walk out on me

2661
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,880
You talk so much
about friendship

2662
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:41,960
This is friendship for you?

2663
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:44,240
As if we are Surya and Deva
from the film 'Thalapathi'

2664
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,800
How long will you continue
to cheat repeating this dialog?

2665
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,040
You won't marry the girl
your parents choose?

2666
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:50,680
You're torturing me
in the name of love

2667
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,000
Those days only lovers died

2668
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,160
But the one who unites them
is dying nowadays

2669
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:01,000
Divya, my dad has
spoken to both of them

2670
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,760
They are coming
to the set tomorrow

2671
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,400
We've done our best

2672
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:06,200
The rest is up to God

2673
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:07,560
You also pray

2674
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:13,080
It's time for the program
Haven't you left yet?

2675
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,840
- I've sent back your car
- Why, madam?

2676
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,640
Because I won't anchor
your show hereafter

2677
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:17,640
What happened, madam?

2678
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:19,560
You brought unknown
people from villages

2679
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:20,960
And asked me to interview them

2680
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,640
I did and the show
was a success

2681
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:23,880
I had no problems

2682
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:28,720
Now you've dragged in
politicians and big shots

2683
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:31,520
They're calling me up
and threatening me

2684
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:32,800
It's okay if they threaten me

2685
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:34,400
But they are disturbing my family

2686
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:35,920
My husband-

2687
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:38,760
- Where are you going?
- I'm going up to Forum mall

2688
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:39,560
Okay, dear

2689
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:40,800
Bye, dear

2690
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:42,360
Take care

2691
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:44,280
It's okay if they threaten me

2692
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,560
But they are threatening to
kidnap and kill my husband

2693
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:48,640
What will we do if you
tell us in the last minute?

2694
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,280
They threatened me
in the last minute

2695
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:51,720
Madam, we can't
do this without you

2696
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,480
Karthi, my family
is my priority

2697
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:54,880
Madam, please help us

2698
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:56,360
Leave me alone, Karthi

2699
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,520
Madam, ple...

2700
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,520
Give it to me
I'll ask her

2701
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:02,360
Madam, I'll come
and fall at your feet

2702
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,200
She has hung up on us

2703
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,000
Madam...

2704
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:12,080
What do we do now?

2705
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:13,920
This lady is putting up her price

2706
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:16,360
That chameleon is
hiding in some canal

2707
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:20,320
That bully Anjali is
waiting for us with a sickle

2708
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:23,680
Hey! Come...come

2709
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:24,920
Start the camera

2710
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:25,880
Stop staring

2711
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:26,960
Come

2712
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:28,720
How did she come?

2713
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,640
Is Urvasi madam here?

2714
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,120
She has to come

2715
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:35,400
She said she won't come
How did you get her here?

2716
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,520
They are villains who
threatened to kill her husband

2717
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:38,400
We are from the media

2718
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:39,680
We can't stoop so low

2719
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:42,200
So I very decently
kidnapped her child

2720
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:43,200
Oh my God!

2721
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:46,200
Get the show going

2722
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:53,280
Govinda, till the program ends
keep the Damocles sword dangling

2723
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:54,800
I'll wait outside

2724
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:56,200
Madam, we are rolling

2725
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:58,120
Just ask the questions
I've written down for you

2726
01:53:58,160 --> 01:53:59,200
No extra questions

2727
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,200
This is my strict order

2728
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:01,640
Throw your order
into the dustbin

2729
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:04,480
If something happens to my baby
I'll burn down your channel

2730
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:07,480
Good morning, viewers

2731
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,360
On behalf of Top TV,
sponsored by Anjali Promoters...

2732
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,320
...this is your Urvasi presenting
'My golden moon of nectar'

2733
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:15,320
Today is a day of
golden opportunities

2734
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:18,120
Because Top TV viewers
from whole of Tamil Nadu...

2735
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:22,040
...from all over the world
are waiting for this show

2736
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:24,760
2 renowned families in Tamil Nadu...

2737
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,360
...are facing this 'Love-galatta'

2738
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:27,600
Who are the celebrities?

2739
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:29,120
Who are the lovers?

2740
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:30,680
What is the problem
with their love?

2741
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:32,240
Will their parents agree?

2742
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,400
So many questions

2743
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:34,600
The result...?

2744
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:35,760
Only today we will know

2745
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:37,400
I am also waiting eagerly

2746
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:39,200
Let's go straight to the show

2747
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:40,720
Please sit down

2748
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:42,040
- Your name?
- Mahesh

2749
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,400
- Your father's name?
- Ilangovan

2750
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:45,360
That caste...that political party's leader?

2751
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,480
Yes, he is my father

2752
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,360
Okay, I understand

2753
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:49,360
Is the girl here?

2754
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:51,040
Ask her to come

2755
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,360
- Hello, ma'am
- Hello, please sit

2756
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,000
- Your name?
- Vaishnavi

2757
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:58,440
Your father's name?

2758
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:00,680
- Samudrakani
- Member of Parliament?

2759
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,000
- The leader's daughter?
- Yes

2760
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:04,040
The suspense has been broken

2761
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:05,960
A member of parliament
and a political leader

2762
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,240
We don't need to elaborate

2763
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:10,360
Okay, both of you
wait outside for a bit

2764
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,480
Anyway we need to
meet both the fathers

2765
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,160
Punch, punch it

2766
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,520
Good day, sir
Please sit

2767
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:21,760
Your son is deeply
in love with a girl

2768
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:22,480
Are you aware?

2769
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,680
People will bad mouth freely
How can I accept all that?

2770
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,120
I know this only through you

2771
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:27,680
Now you know, right?

2772
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:30,360
I've given you very good news
And you're having a long face!

2773
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:35,560
That means you oppose love
and people in love, right, sir?

2774
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:36,920
I think you got me wrong

2775
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,320
Look at me properly
I'm not that kind of a person

2776
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:42,560
So you accept
your son's choice

2777
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:43,640
I swear I won't

2778
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:45,480
You're a very influential man
in today's society

2779
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:47,200
How can you go back
on your own word?

2780
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:48,960
I have my own reasons
for opposing this

2781
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:50,800
Because my son loves a girl...

2782
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:53,680
...and someone in her family
disapproves and commits suicide

2783
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,520
And if their relatives also
commit suicide seeing this

2784
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:59,640
How traumatic it will be
That's why I am against it

2785
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:02,720
I'm not against
people falling in love

2786
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:04,560
I approve of love marriage

2787
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:07,440
Then why do you hesitate
to get your daughter married?

2788
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:08,280
Okay, sir

2789
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:11,280
What kind of girl do you
want your son to marry?

2790
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:13,000
A girl who will adjust
to my family's needs

2791
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:16,880
One who doesn't take my son to
live with her in her parents' house

2792
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:19,320
Is this the way a man
of your standing talks?

2793
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:20,880
Life is a circle

2794
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:23,360
A winner can lose
and a loser can win

2795
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,000
This is a punch dialog
if hero Vijay says it

2796
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:27,120
Why do we need this?
Go back to the show

2797
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:29,640
Let me ask you finally

2798
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:33,040
Will you agree to let your son
marry the girl he loves?

2799
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:34,280
I swear I won't

2800
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,200
Ma'am, this is the right moment

2801
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,160
He has said no

2802
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:39,600
Just wind up
and go for a break

2803
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:41,040
Did you listen, viewers?

2804
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:44,480
The boy's father has
refused vehemently

2805
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,720
Is your heartbeat racing?

2806
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:48,000
So is mine

2807
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:50,800
I don't know if the girl's
father will agree or not

2808
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:51,800
Let's wait and see

2809
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,520
We'll go for a short break

2810
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:55,040
Cut this now

2811
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:56,760
I don't know
if my baby is okay

2812
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,680
She goes with anyone
who buys her ice cream

2813
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:00,400
Should 1st change this habit

2814
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:03,080
Honey, is the ice cream yummy?

2815
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:04,560
I have to go back
Just a little longer

2816
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:05,720
I'll finish it and come

2817
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:07,280
Hey! Come here

2818
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:10,760
How many times have I told you
not to do programs like this?

2819
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,720
Sir, look at my situation

2820
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,760
A man is holding a knife
over my daughter's head

2821
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,160
How will I not agree?

2822
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,520
Why can't you do some-

2823
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:18,640
Shut up

2824
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:19,800
Threatening a woman

2825
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:20,720
Look here

2826
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:22,120
What I don't understand is-

2827
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:22,640
Tell me

2828
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:23,760
You've tied me up here

2829
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,600
Who is my clone
on your show?

2830
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:26,480
Is he my dupe?

2831
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,720
What funny business
are you up to, nailing me in?

2832
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:31,240
As if I crucified you
This is your own doing

2833
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,800
Listen to me

2834
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:41,800
You don't know my power
And you're acting funny with me

2835
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:45,520
Not knowing this
I kissed your stupid face

2836
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,480
Looks like he will kill me first

2837
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,320
Serves you right, rowdy

2838
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:52,720
How dare you do this-

2839
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:53,920
Stop screaming

2840
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,880
What is this program?

2841
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:00,320
They want us to nod our heads
and they'll get this couple together

2842
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:01,760
But we're sitting here royally

2843
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,920
Who cares if they tie us up?

2844
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:06,920
We just tied them up

2845
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,920
How will they talk
on the show?

2846
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:11,200
Why are you changing
the background?

2847
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:14,720
It was a huge mistake
to hire you I think

2848
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,480
Why are you
killing me like this?

2849
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:19,000
Chief, don't get me tensed

2850
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:19,840
Come here

2851
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,080
What video is playing here?

2852
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,960
The video we shot
in each of their houses

2853
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:29,280
What was the first question
we asked Ilango?

2854
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:33,080
We asked him if he had
a hand in rowdy Kasi's murder

2855
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:33,960
What did he say?

2856
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:36,360
He said 'people will
bad mouth freely'

2857
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:37,680
'How can I accept all that?'

2858
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:39,720
'I am hearing about this
only through you'

2859
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:42,360
Now we'll ask a question
to suit that answer

2860
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:43,200
What question?

2861
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:46,600
Your son is in love with a girl
Do you know about it or not?

2862
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:47,840
How will he answer?

2863
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:51,000
'People will bad mouth freely'

2864
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,360
'How can I accept all that?'

2865
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:55,560
'I am hearing about this
only through'-

2866
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,280
Super!

2867
01:58:57,320 --> 01:59:00,920
You are framing questions for
their answers already recorded

2868
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:03,720
That's why you're changing
the background like a drawing hall

2869
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:06,440
Now you understand?

2870
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:08,360
Some random stranger
will walk into your house

2871
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:09,360
Flash his visiting card

2872
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:10,560
And show you a sim card

2873
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:12,600
And you swallow all that
You have no brains?

2874
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:15,200
This small kid knows
what a sim card is

2875
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:18,240
You made them come inside
with all their cameras

2876
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:20,400
Blabbered away to glory!

2877
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:22,000
And now it's being
telecast on TV

2878
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:24,920
He's a fool

2879
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,240
He would have blabbered

2880
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:27,240
I'm not like that

2881
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,160
I've spoken sensibly
Crystal clear words

2882
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:30,880
Crystal clear and sensible

2883
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:32,800
Come and see
your performance

2884
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:34,280
How do you think
you are acting?

2885
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:35,440
Don't glare

2886
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:37,320
Raise your emotion a bit
It isn't enough

2887
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:38,160
Emotion

2888
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,840
I'll stamp you so many times
you'll know what motion is

2889
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,160
Threatening me, huh?

2890
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:44,280
It isn't easy even with
people seated here

2891
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:46,640
You expect me to emote
to an empty sofa!

2892
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,280
Okay, start

2893
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:51,200
Welcome back to
'My golden moon of nectar'

2894
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,840
'Live' show, ma'am

2895
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:54,640
Smile while you speak

2896
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:57,400
Welcome back to
'My golden moon of nectar'

2897
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,240
Let us talk to
the girl's father

2898
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:02,200
Let's ask him
what his problem is

2899
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:03,720
Welcome to our show, sir

2900
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,120
This isn't me

2901
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:07,680
They are fooling the public

2902
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:09,000
Shut up, man

2903
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:11,840
Do you like Taj Mahal or not?

2904
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:14,280
What's the connection between
a politician and Taj Mahal?

2905
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:17,120
In your election promises
your first endorsement was...

2906
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:19,880
'...approval of inter-caste marriage'

2907
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:20,640
Right?

2908
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:23,480
Inter-caste marriage
naturally means love

2909
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:25,600
Epitome of love is
Taj Mahal for all of us

2910
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:27,520
That's why I asked
if you like Taj Mahal?

2911
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:28,760
Okay, cut to Samudrakani

2912
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:29,800
I'm also human

2913
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:31,560
I also empathize
with people's problems

2914
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:33,160
I approve of love marriage

2915
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:35,560
They are quoting me
out of context

2916
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:36,480
In fact this month...

2917
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:39,280
...I'm getting 100 lovers married
on behalf of the party!

2918
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:41,080
At least I spoke indirectly

2919
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:42,800
You've accepted openly

2920
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:44,520
So you support love

2921
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:49,640
Then you must be able to
accept your daughter's choice?

2922
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,760
Your thought, intention
and question are all wrong

2923
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:54,800
Hey! Shut up, man

2924
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,240
My daughter will never
make any blunder like that

2925
02:00:57,320 --> 02:01:00,880
You're in front of me now
because your daughter fell in love

2926
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:02,360
No, it was a different question

2927
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,320
This is the case of jumping from
the frying pan into the fire

2928
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:04,960
Shut up

2929
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:05,800
Look, sir

2930
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:11,720
What can you do if your daughter
insists on marrying the boy she loves?

2931
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:12,640
I'll slice them

2932
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:14,760
They are youngsters
What crime have they committed?

2933
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:16,400
They fell in love
and got married

2934
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:18,400
How can you say
you'll kill them?

2935
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:20,960
I didn't mean
my daughter or her lover

2936
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:22,360
But the ones who unite them

2937
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:28,000
Cut it, my tongue is twisting!

2938
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:30,160
I can't see him
I can only hear him

2939
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:31,400
And I'm having palpitations!

2940
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:33,560
Should I continue the program?

2941
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:38,520
Why are you calling Govindaraj?
Govindaraj, don't do anything

2942
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:39,960
Okay
Continue

2943
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:40,640
Come

2944
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:42,120
What, sir?

2945
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:44,360
You only say 'kill' or 'cripple'?

2946
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:47,280
Why are you saying
you don't want this boy?

2947
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:48,080
Cut the dialog

2948
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:49,240
Raise the music

2949
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:52,920
Cut this and move to madam

2950
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,640
Do an intercut now

2951
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:01,880
That's not me
I'm here

2952
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:03,960
Chief, before you send them
send the cameraman in

2953
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:05,360
Go to the right,
take a close up

2954
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,320
Before you roll
lift your hand when ready

2955
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:09,400
Vaishnavi, run in
Don't relax

2956
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:11,280
Vaishnavi, don't go

2957
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:12,440
Because of your mistake-

2958
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:13,920
Please agree, dad

2959
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,560
Please accept him

2960
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:16,920
Sir, please...

2961
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:18,960
We love each other sincerely

2962
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:19,920
Move left

2963
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:20,880
Go for a close shot

2964
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:22,600
Keep rolling
Don't cut

2965
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:23,880
Keep rolling
Don't go wide

2966
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:25,600
You have to pan
Don't zoom

2967
02:02:25,680 --> 02:02:28,160
Madam, this is the last
chance for your son's love

2968
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:30,600
Cry with all your heart
So viewers will believe you

2969
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:31,760
1 & 2 ready?

2970
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:33,040
Your turn now

2971
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:35,400
I asked you to stay at home
Why did you come here?

2972
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:38,000
Sir, why are you holding on
to false prestige with your child?

2973
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:40,320
Didn't we fall in love
and get married ourselves?

2974
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:41,040
Wretched chap!

2975
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:42,840
If she could fall
for his ugly face...

2976
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:43,960
...why can't he just say 'yes'?

2977
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:45,800
Why are you stopping
our son's wedding?

2978
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:48,080
So sad! She is more
concerned than you, sir

2979
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:50,280
Dad, please agree
She really loves me

2980
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,200
Vaishnavi,
get up and cry

2981
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:53,400
Try to understand, dad

2982
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:00,000
If you say okay,
he'll agree too

2983
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:02,040
You think I'll agree
if you do?

2984
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:05,880
Sir, you counsel
for the whole town

2985
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:09,840
Your daughter is fighting
for her love for so long

2986
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:10,880
She may faint!

2987
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:12,840
Just give a positive reply, sir

2988
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:15,320
Don't cry

2989
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,040
Don't cry, Vaishu

2990
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:20,760
I can't bear to see
my daughter cry

2991
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:23,280
That's why I'm giving in

2992
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:26,440
Thank you, sir
That's good news

2993
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,080
Then what, sir?

2994
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:30,160
The girl's father has agreed
with an open heart

2995
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:31,040
You also-

2996
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:31,720
Look there

2997
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:33,600
Just say yes, please

2998
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:34,840
You're the one who fell in love

2999
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:37,720
You should have said okay first

3000
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:39,880
Okay, don't cry

3001
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,880
I love him
as much as you do

3002
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:43,840
She'll get her way
shedding a sea of tears

3003
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:44,760
Very glad

3004
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:47,920
So both parents have agreed

3005
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:49,840
Viewers, please don't
believe this farce

3006
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:51,440
Next step is the wedding

3007
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:54,560
So wipe your tears

3008
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:55,720
Both sides have agreed

3009
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:56,560
Happy, now?

3010
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:59,760
Go, freshen up
and come back

3011
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:01,920
Don't delay

3012
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:04,680
You must exchange garlands
within the prescribed auspicious time

3013
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:06,400
Sir, you've both agreed

3014
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:08,920
But your faces look
angry and sullen

3015
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:10,600
Go and wash your faces

3016
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:12,240
Tell everyone the good news

3017
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:14,040
So many are waiting outside

3018
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:15,600
Thank you, sir

3019
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:17,200
Ask him to punch camera 3

3020
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,520
Camera 3

3021
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,280
Well orchestrated show
for true love to win

3022
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:25,040
Brought to you
by 2 youngsters

3023
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:28,520
Karthik and Billa are
the brains behind this show

3024
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:29,840
Shall we call them?

3025
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,840
Karthi, Billa, come

3026
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:34,800
Let me go to the loo

3027
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,120
Come on, you guys

3028
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,960
Viewers are keen to see you

3029
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:38,840
Get up

3030
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:40,240
I'm touched by your respect!

3031
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,640
If you do this, they'll think
this was all my idea

3032
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:45,360
Let everyone know it was yours

3033
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,840
Get up

3034
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:50,200
You should be face to face with
viewers worldwide, turn around

3035
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:53,120
They are the masterminds
All I did was act

3036
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:55,320
It's time to get married

3037
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:56,880
Ask the groom and bride to come

3038
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,440
Come, come quickly

3039
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:00,560
Come this side

3040
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:02,280
Where are the parents?

3041
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:05,640
Oh! They are announcing
the good news to their volunteers

3042
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:06,520
Good...good

3043
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,280
Look how your son
has lured my daughter

3044
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,120
Shut up

3045
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:11,240
Not him

3046
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:13,360
Mano, bring the garlands

3047
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,280
Hold

3048
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,400
Exchange garlands

3049
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:21,680
Vaishu...!

3050
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:24,000
Stand together

3051
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:25,440
- Billa!
- Karthik

3052
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:27,320
We won't let you guys live

3053
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:28,760
We'll chop you to pieces

3054
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:30,800
We'll speak to another couple
same time tomorrow

3055
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,600
Until then,
your Urvasi

3056
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:34,040
You forgot to
say Top TV's name

3057
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:34,720
Get lost

3058
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:35,600
Bull!

3059
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:36,960
I want to ensure
my baby is fine

3060
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,480
I'll murder Govindaraj

3061
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:41,560
I'm coming,
my precious darling!

3062
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:44,360
Standing over her
with a Damocles sword

3063
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:45,360
Stick that in your head

3064
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:46,520
Story is over

3065
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:47,480
Get lost!

3066
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:49,320
- Mom?
- What?

3067
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:51,480
Who are these grandpas?

3068
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:52,560
They are robbers

3069
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:53,960
The police will
arrest them now

3070
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:54,920
Let's run away

3071
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:56,280
We got them together

3072
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:57,600
Wonder what will happen to us?

3073
02:05:57,680 --> 02:06:00,240
They are ready for their honeymoon
without so much as a thank you

3074
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:01,200
You should be pun-

3075
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:02,560
Okay, be happy

3076
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:05,720
Better untie me

3077
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:07,240
Don't do anything to us

3078
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:08,960
The girl and boy requested

3079
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:10,720
I came for his sake

3080
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,920
I must take the main road
Don't follow me

3081
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:14,720
Wait!

3082
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:20,080
Don't let them go

3083
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:20,880
Finish them

3084
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,240
You heard it right?
Do the same

3085
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:24,760
He's robbing even my words
And I'm related to him by marriage!

3086
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:25,920
I'm not related to you

3087
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:29,440
I can't run

3088
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:33,040
I think we'll get
caught in a dead end

3089
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:36,560
Please don't kill me

3090
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:43,560
You'll join them together
and you think we'll let you go?

3091
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:14,440
Come, come

3092
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,600
They are both coming out

3093
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:25,040
You are both powerful leaders

3094
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:28,800
Both of you have your own
set of followers and votes

3095
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:32,200
If you get together, people think
you'll be the next chief minister

3096
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:33,560
What do you think about that?

3097
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:34,120
'What?'

3098
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:35,280
'The next chief minister?'

3099
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:36,800
'Sounds awesome'

3100
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:38,680
'But I doubt if he'll agree'

3101
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:39,800
What do you think, sir?

3102
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,600
'There are so many cases against me'

3103
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:43,360
'And the police are
waiting to kill me'

3104
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:45,640
'If he's the chief minister,
we'll be related'

3105
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:47,440
'And no one can touch me'

3106
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:53,440
Long live Samudrakani
Future chief minister!

3107
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:57,120
Take a good photo

3108
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:08,400
Sir?

3109
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:09,880
- Let them go
- Okay, sir

3110
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:10,880
What happened?

3111
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:11,960
He said, 'let them go'

3112
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:15,680
We didn't even stab them
and they're lying there dead

3113
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:19,440
Wonder what their performance
will be when they get married!

3114
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,720
They got scared of us and left

3115
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:25,200
Yes, chief
