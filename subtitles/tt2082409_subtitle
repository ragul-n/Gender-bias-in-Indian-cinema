Grandpa, won't the police

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,750
Only the God can...

19
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,030
Who do you think you're
messing with?

20
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,150
You walk into my territory... and...?

To end each one's story...

25
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,670
Whether it is to threaten, bash up,
solve disputes, cut off body parts

And only me...

29
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,270
Why? Because...

30
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,790
l'm the villain...

31
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,910
- whether it is to threaten or bash up
- whether it is to threaten or bash up

32
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,110
- solve disputes, cut off body parts

36
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,510
What is this? His modulation sucks!
He's goofing up big time!

37
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,790
Why can't you deliver your dialogue right?

38
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,950
There's no emotion in it!

39
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,950
Sir, l'll do it right in the next take sir!

40
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,870
Sorry sir!

41
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,310
Such a goofy he is!

42
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,310
Dude, l Just finished speaking those
dialogues in three languages...

43
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,310
in my imagination.

44
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,520
Look at him struggling with one language!

45
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,580
Hey, give me that!

46
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,750
And... we don't get such roles!!

47
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,430
Anall, don't you think this is too much?

48
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,510
Chill will you...?

49
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,150
Your younger brother is
eating this instead of you!

50
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,590
Why don't you eat some curd rice
with this ginger candy?

51
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,390
Your digestion will be good!

52
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,830
You gave me this ginger candy and
ate all that's mine huh?

53
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,670
Hey Muruga, your plate looks full l see!

54
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,110

Anall, you seem to be in full flow
with the dialogues!!

57
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,670
Compliments for only my dialogues?
What about my performance?

58
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,060
Sit...

59
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,310

60
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,830
Anall, you were too good! Superb!

61
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,350
Bro, don't stop with Just your praises!

62
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,390
When you make your film,
give me the villain's role in it!

63
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,070
lt's my dream...
to become a good villain!

Sure! When l make my film,
you're the villain in it!

65
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,030
Ok brother!

66
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,470
Do we have shooting tomorrow?

67
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,630
Not for you guys.
lt's the heroine's introduction scene.

68
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,820
lf you're asked to vacate,
do it and get lost. Alright?

69
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,710
What's the commotion about?

70
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,030
Don't make problem's here
lt's a ladies hostal

71
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,790
Aren't my words clear enough to you?

72
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,420
Call the police... fast

73
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,790
Sir, be patient...

74
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,790
What?

75
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,030
You think you can threaten us
by calling the police?

76
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,990
And we'd get scared?

77
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,750
You know who we are right?

78
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,990
We're a part of Akka's gang!

79
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,270
Give us your hostel and leave...

80
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,270
else you'll die!

81
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,870
Even we know political
heavy weights!

82
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,310
Try scaring someone else... go!

83
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,740
Hey! Why're you repeating
yourself again and again?

84
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,550
Give me that weapon!

85
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,110
Action!

86
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,350
l'm the villain man!

87
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,110
Are we playing a scene
for you to watch?

88
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,390
l'm the co-director!

89
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,380
We know K.V.Anand is
the director of Ko

90
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,630
But are you the director of KO?

91
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,910
No sir, l meant co-director...

92
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,870
another term for
assistant director...

93
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,750
Are you lying to me?
l'll shove this in!

94
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,110
Get lost from here!

95
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,390
You kids! Your mom and dad will
be searching for you at home...

96
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,280
come on... get going!!

97
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,500
Go... go... go...

98
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,470
See what l do to you!

99
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,830
Hey... start the car...

100
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,710
Don't you know you've to open the door?

101
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,430
What are you guys doing here?

102
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,350
Hey, we were standing right behind you.

103
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,430
You want to ditch us for
the song sequence huh?

104
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,870
Don't we want to be in songs too?

105
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,870
Don't bug me! Get lost!

106
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,620
We can dance too!

107
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,700
l've lost my mood for the song!

108
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,860
There's no song here!

109
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,630
My plight with you guys around...
Oh god!!

110
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,310
Hey, look... the oldie is right there!

111
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,510
Get him guys...

112
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,350
Take him aside.

113
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,790
Hey... what's he doing?
Kung-fu in mid air?

114
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,990
Go and ask him to get down!

115
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,030
You help him do it!

116
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,630
That blacky got me into trouble!
Ok... l'll handle it!

117
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,820
Just kidding my doll...

118
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,750
We're Just playing!!

119
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,310
l've known young boys abduct young girls

120
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,150
why did they come for an
old guy like you? Who are they?

121
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,190
My son's goons!

122
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,620
ln times where children disown their
parents, here's one hunting him down?

123
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,950
l presume you've got all
the property in your name?

124
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,590
Yes

125
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,990
My name is Dakshinamoorthy.
When l was young...

126
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,670
You started to narrate your
flash back all of a sudden? Hang on...

127
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,910
Go on...

128
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,230
l was very young when l lost my mother.
My father was everything to me!

129
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:36,910
OK

130
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,950
l enJoyed life so much till l was 20!
l was extremely happy!

131
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,030
After my dad died,
l was alone... orphaned!

132
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,030
My life was dull!

133
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,060
lt was then l met my Lakshmi
at an orphanage!

134
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,780
My life gained a purpose
only after l married her!

135
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,500
l started a Jewellery store...
earned a lot of money!

136
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,990
As per Lakshmi's wishes, we built
an orphanage about 20 years ago.

137
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,950
She had a beautiful heart!

138
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,750
A helping hand too...

139
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,430
She used say that 'no one is an orphan
till there is another person in this world!'

140
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,630
After she died, as per her wishes,
l buried her in our ashram premises.

141
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,790
The life l lived with her
was full of happiness!

142
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,550
l expected a sorrow filled flashback,
but your story seems to be a happy one?

143
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,630
Hang on... at any given point...
distress somehow pierces a person.

144
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,190
And that came through my own son!

145
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,390
Can you give me that property or no?

146
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,230
Akka, l know why you're asking
for that one in particular.

147
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,380
The sub-urban city is going to be built
near that area and once that's done

148
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,590
the value of my property
will go up by a hundred folds!

149
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,870
What's your price for it?

150
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,030
l don't want any money!

151
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,020
l've been struggling to make it
big in politics for a while now.

152
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,300
Nothing has worked in my favour

153
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,270
ln the coming elections,
on behalf of your party, if you

154
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,590
give me a seat,
l will become the MLA.

155
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,870
lt is in your hands.

156
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,900
We can have the registration
when you decide.

157
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,750
l don't want a single penny!

158
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,870
When can we see the place?

159
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,190
How many acres is it?
- 25 Acres Akka.

160
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,990
That Ashram is not some place.
lt is my temple.

161
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,750
My Lakshmi still lives there.

162
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,710
The kids there are her life!

163
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,070
l can't part with that Ashram alone!

164
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,870
You're talking without
understanding it's value!

165
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,180
To become an MLA is my
fifteen year old dream!

166
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,220
Why don't you understand dad?

167
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,590
Dad, it's for your best that you
listen to me... or else...

168
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,470
He's been chasing after me
to sell that orphanage now...

169
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,620
Till your son finds you, there's nothing
he can do to the orphanage.

170
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,070
The kids will be safe too.

171
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,310
The best thing is for you
to come along with me!

172
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,270
Come what may,
l'll take care of you!

173
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,900
Why should l burden you with my weight?

174
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,910
You weigh so much huh?

175
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,110
Ok, l'll come... happy now?

176
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,670
Sir, if you tell us about
the constituency allotments...

177
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,830
We'll talk about that after three days.
Any more questions?

178
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,870
Which areas have you chosen
for the sub-urban city development?

179
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,630
That's right sir. The opposition party
has been asking about it too!

180
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,070
Ranganayaki, why has there been a delay?

181
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,070
We'll announce it by next week.

182
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,030
Do it fast.
Let's go.

183
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,350
Did Chidambaram call back?

184
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,900
He's not answering his phone at all!

185
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,750
Give me his number...

186
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,270
Bro, why're you getting tensed?

187
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,550
l'd promised the registration
would happen today!

188
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,790
Ask her for a week's time.
We'll find him by then!

189
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,190
You found him and
let him escape...and now what?

190
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,110
What if you can't?
- End of your story then!

191
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,590
ls Brother in there?
-Yes Sir!

192
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,750
Bro, Akka is here.

193
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,820
You won't answer your phone?

194
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,020
The property is in my dad's name.

195
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,430
We need his signature
to proceed legally.

196
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,660
Hence...

197
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,030
ls this your father?

198
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,820
Take a Xerox of this photo...

199
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,630
l don't know if you'll mail
or courier it...

200
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,300
By tomorrow morning all our land
brokers should have this man's photo.

201
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,350
Ask them to search every
lodge, house, temples etc.

202
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,550
The registration has to be
completed by this week.

203
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,310
You saved that old guy
from getting assaulted, alright.

204
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,150
But letting him stay with you
is Just not done!

205
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,430
when l was young, if anyone fed me,
l'd look up to them like the God himself!

206
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,420
His plight is quite sad.

207
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,790
He's providing education, food and
shelter to many kids for the last 25 years!

208
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,830
lf he signs the agreement,
they'll make all those kids homeless!

209
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,310
Only till the guy is safe with me,
the kids can live peacefully.

210
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,630
Bro?

211
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,470
Yeah, we're close to the shooting spot.

212
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,870
At the tea shop...
We'll be there in five minutes.

213
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:52,870
Ok brother.

214
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,230
You know the kidnap
scene in our story?

215
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,030
We'll lift it from this...

216
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,540
We'll shoot it differently.

217
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,680
Old man, you've the habit of
drinking coffee??

218
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,910
But we do!

219
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,470
Old man, do you have
the habit of drinking?

220
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,190
lt's been 10-15 years
since l gave it up!

221
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,390
You're turn has come today!

222
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,100
Stop! Where did you go?

223
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,630
Stepped out for a while.

224
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,940
Stepped out for a while!!!

225
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,150
You think l'd get scared
if you scream?

226
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,150
Take this. Dry the clothes.

227
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,830
Only fit only to sit and
gulp down food!

228
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,030
What's up bro?

229
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,390
Anull, l called your mobile,
it was switched off!

230
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,270
Oh! l've lost charge!

231
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,180
Do you have shoot tomorrow?

232
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,870
No. Why?

233
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,190
Akka's having a MMEK meeting tomorrow.

234
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,470
They've asked for hundred
security guys!

235
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,980
Bring your guys and come...

236
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,160
Bro, to stand as an extra
behind a villain is my Job...

237
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,070
We do it with a content heart!

238
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,790
l can't stand behind these
politicians like extras!

239
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,990
Hey, you'll get good money!

240
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,750
lf l become a thug in real life,
l'd earn in millions, Just like that!

241
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,630
Did we come to cinema to earn money?

242
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,830
lt's a small dream... l mean...

243
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,860
Like the city should have
our posters stuck all over!

244
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,790
The minute we come on screen...

245
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,110
everyone should go berserk,
clap, whistle... and that's it!

246
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,750
My dream is to be a big villain!
Please understand brother!

247
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,350
At least, you don't
treat me like a thug!

248
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,270
And henceforth,
don't call me for such things!

249
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,420
Hey, get everything ready.
l'll bring Grandpa and come...

250
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,190
You should listen to him narrate
his story... like poetry!!

251
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:57,950
Come on dude...

252
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,630
One day, my love was waiting for
her bus, with henna on her feet...

253
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,070
She boarded the bus and left,

254
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,070
Leaving behind the Jasmine flowers
fallen from her head...

255
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,270
When l saw those Jasmine flowers...
A poem came to my mind grandpa...

256
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,230
''From the footprint of your henna
dyed feet, Grew a beautiful Jasmine flower!''

257
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,030
l went to see her the
next day with the poem

258
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,150
but she never came grandpa...

259
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,460
l even went the day after...

260
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,280
But she never came...
Till the very end... grandpa...

261
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,910
l don't care if she'd
gotten married...

262
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,790
But l didn't get to recite
this poem to her!

263
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,680
You fool! Wasted a
beautiful piece of poetry!

264
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,910
lf it were me, l would've wooed at least
five girls with that kind of poetry!

265
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:29,870
Five... yeah...

266
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,470
Dakshina...
when you were young...??

267
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,110
The girls l've wooed....

268
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,550
lt's impossible to
do the math!

269
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,150
When lndia was under
the rule of British,

270
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,940
there was a British girl
under my rule!

271
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,670
British girl?

272
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,630
She fell for my personality...
my first love...

273
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,470
Mary Margret!... in 1942!

274
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,070
Don't ask Shanmugam about
what l'd asked you yesterday.

275
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,390
Dakshina, get going...
l'll see you soon!

276
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,990
lf l don't sleep till even 1 1 o' clock,
how would l become a director?

277
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,350
What a devastating Job l've got!

278
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,630
Brother!
Yes my younger brother!

279
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,190
l hear you torture Dakshina a lot!

280
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,350
Yeah l did.

281
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,990
lf you bring home a guy who's
supposed to be in the old age home,

282
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,950
how can l write my romantic script?

283
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,630
Creators like me have to be alone
to trigger our creativity!

284
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,430
That is only if you have any!

285
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,950
What was that?
- What was that??

286
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,710
Don't l have to write a story? My film?
Get married? Run a family and have kids?

287
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,020
Listen, take this oldie and go elsewhere.
Otherwise l'll torture him!!

288
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,470
Very good! That's how you should be!

289
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,070
You think l'm a fool
to feed a man for free?

290
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,310
That old man is worth
300 crores of rupees!

291
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,390
300 crores of rupees?
l almost missed a good producer!

292
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,230
We're chalking a good plan...
so we can settle in life!

293
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,030
So continue to torture him, alright?

294
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,990
So our lives can be good!

295
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,310
lf you sentimentally flatter him
and try to take a share...

296
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,070
He'd never dare to torture him anymore!

297
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,670
Share huh? l'll pocket
the entire 300 crores!

298
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,790
What is it sir?

299
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,830
Yeah, Suriya's film...
Solo fight with him and me.

300
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,870
Urgh! These rouges come here
with one dirty purpose!

301
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,950
Man, things seem rough here,
hang up now!

302
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,350
She actually spat on you!!!

303
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,590
Forget about it buddy!
lt happens...

304
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,070
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

305
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,990
What do l do grandpa?

306
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,030
Moms accompany their daughter.

307
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,630
lf l glance at the girl,
the mother gets angry!

308
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,150
l can't even glance at
the girl with freedom!

309
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,910
There's a trick for all that,
you idiot!

310
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,710
Look there...

311
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,430
Both of them are walking there...

312
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,870
The girl's hot too...

313
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,030
ldiot! Don't look at the girl...
look at her mother.

314
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,870
Mother?
-Look at her l say!

315
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,390
Gaze at her!

316
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,470
Grandpa, looks like the mother
will fall into my trap!

317
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,230
Now turn your look towards the girl!

318
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,070
His hairstyle looks so different!
May be he's a rock singer?

319
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,550
Grandpa!!!!

320
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,510
This is Just the beginning!
There's so much more to learn!

321
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,790
Are you taking classes Dakshina?

322
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,310
Does he have a girl in his life...
Or is he single?

323
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,390
Oh cut that! Love is not meant for me...
l'm happy with simple glances!

324
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,710
Ask me to bash up a hundred guys
and l'd do that in a flash!

325
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,920
Talking to a woman...
makes me shiver!

326
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,310
That's why l stick to
Just giving them soft glances!

327
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,270
And l carry on that way...

328
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,550
Hey girl!!

329
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,710
Yeah... you...!

330
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,990
Dakshina, what are you doing?
Why did you look at him?

331
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,350
Don't make things ugly...
come here...

332
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,510
Don't deny that you looked at him!

333
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,310
You'll give him such glances
and make him fall for you...

334
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,750
And then marry someone else citing
your parents as the reason

335
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,870
and that he's not the one for you...

336
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,390
And these guys...
become hopeless in life and die!

337
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,510
lsn't that your plan?

338
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,710
Tell me the truth,
did you see him or no?

339
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,180
Don't do this... please...

340
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:52,870
l didn't!

341
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,150
Don't say the same thing again
and again... and provoke me!

342
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,390
l noticed you saw him.

343
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,550
You're talking a bit too much...
yes, she saw him.

344
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,550
Whom are you raising
your voice at?

345
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,900
Ask her to admit it.

346
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,900
Admit it!! Now!

347
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:08,910
Yes l did look at him.

348
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,590
There she goes!
She did look at you!

349
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,790
Wait and see what l do!

350
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,830
Ok, come now...
Sorry...

351
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,430
Why'd you have to do that?

352
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,870
You don't seem to understand.
There's no use hiding things.

353
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,510
lt's better to ask them
on their face. - Like this?

354
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,230
What will people
around think of me?

355
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,700
Why do you care?

356
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,990
Be transparent...
that's how you will win!

357
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,460
Ok you go... l'll come...

358
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,190
l'll come along too...

359
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,710
Go....

360
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,780
l'm feeling very sorry...

361
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,150
lt's ok... no problem...

362
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,070
lt's not ok...

363
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,950
The old man was wrong!
How can he...?

364
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,870
lt's ok... he's an elderly person...
l'm sorry too...

365
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,500
You're not feeling bad,
are you?

366
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,190
Grandpa! l know you're
angry with me!

367
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,990
l wasn't really angry...
that was Just for fun!

368
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,630
Yeah... l'll do it...

369
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,190
There's a scene in my film...
l'll tell you what it is...

370
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,070
How would the emotions
of elders be...

371
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,550
if they're shouted at and
abused all the time?

372
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,910
l was putting up an act!

373
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,180
Do you know the title of my film?

374
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,860
''Never go against your Grandfather!''

375
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,580
He doesn't seem impressed!!??

376
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,910
Shall l describe my film in one line?

377
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,840
Mother comes first...
and then grandfather!

378
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,230
Get lost you...!

379
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,630
Don'tJudge it half way through...

380
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,790
300 crores!

381
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,630
That's as simple as a
chicken catch for me!

382
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,310
l'll tell you the story now...

383
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,670
Stay in a meditative mood...

384
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,910
The opening...

385
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,590
Dakshina?

386
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,590
He ended my story with his entry!!

387
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,790
Don't leak my story!

388
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,670
You think you can flatter him
by narrating your story huh?

389
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,550
No use to it!
-Where did you go?

390
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,390
To have a cup of tea!

391
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,470
Don't lie. You must've gone
to apologize to that girl!

392
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,670
Dakshina?

393
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,230
l'm sure she said sorry too?

394
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,030
How did you know...?

395
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,070
You both would've kept apologizing
to each other for no reason!

396
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,990
Dakshina! My Almighty!!!
-Get up!!

397
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,860
You're acting in front of me huh?

398
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,470
l was the one who taught
Kamal Hassan how to act!

399
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,230
Oh really?

400
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,740
Too bad, he doesn't realize it himself.

401
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,790
So, you've been in love for what...
six months now?

402
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,110
No. l've Just been glancing at her
from a distance for three years now.

403
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,070
What? Three years?
And Just glances?

404
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,110
Sit...

405
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,820
When she crosses by you
tomorrow morning...

406
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,150
watch her... she'll give you
a smile and cross by...

407
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,430
You think so?
- Yeah!

408
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,950
Let's see!

409
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,630
ls she coming?

410
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,070
Sorry bro!

411
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,150
ls she coming?
- No!

412
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,710
Yeah... there she is!

413
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,790
ls she looking at you?

414
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,430
ls she looking at you?
- No!

415
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,220
Don't look elsewhere!
Keep looking at her!

416
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,510
She did look at me and smile!

417
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,070
What happened to you?

418
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,230
l feel this new sensation within me!

419
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,830
So what you've got to do with it is...

420
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,830
Give you a treat right? Sure!

421
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,350
Grandpa, the snacks are on me!

422
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,860
Shut up! ldiot!

423
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,430
Ask her for a date to a
movie this Sunday, go!

424
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,190
Movie? No way!

425
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,710
After three whole years,
only today she looked at me and smiled...

426
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,590
So who made this happen today?
That hasn't happened in three years?

427
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,670
Who??

428
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,950
This lover boy!

429
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,190
Don't show off too much!

430
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,590
ln life...

431
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,860
Hey... come here... come...

432
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,980
Don't forget!

433
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,870
ln life... there are things...

434
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,950
ln life... there are things
you shouldn't delay.

435
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,710
lf you're hungry, you should eat.

436
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,910
Otherwise, the food is wasted
and so is your stomach!

437
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,830
Sounds good,
but your dialogue doesn't rhyme!

438
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,230
You should only expect good timing
with me, not rhyming!

439
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,670
The formula of love
is very simple...

440
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,870
To wait endlessly for that good moment
to arrive has only led to failure!

441
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,540
Those who've been spontaneous
have been winners!

442
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,430
What do you want now?
l should go talk to that girl?

443
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,540
There's no dearth to your style!

444
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,470
Look me!!

445
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,790
Hey... walk like you're approaching
your lady love...

446
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,340
Not as if you're going to rape her!

447
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,070
l've gotten used to it because
of my villain roles.

448
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,230
Alright! Loosen your body!
Loosen your buttocks!

449
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,150
Don't embarrass me!!

450
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,700
Why're they coming here?
- l don't know. l have no idea!

451
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,590
Look at me... imitate me!
Ok?

452
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,030
Hi
- Hi

453
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,110
They're coming closer...
They're coming to see you l'm sure.

454
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,070
Once you're close enough, ask her
''Darling, can we go for a movie?''

455
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,550
Careful!

456
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,150
All the best

457
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,310
Hi.
-Talk to him.

458
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,830
l've got two tickets for MayaJaal
this Sunday. See you there!

459
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,670
Why?
-Why?!!

460
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,390
For a movie.

461
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,470
Movie? l can't come.

462
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,110
Why not? l'll whack you!

463
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,710
Didn't you admit you looked
at him the other day?

464
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,470
You'd look at him but
not go for a movie?

465
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,470
What do we look like
to you? Fools?

466
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,070
You better come!

467
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,550
lf you don't l'll whack you!

468
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,110
You have to!

469
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,510
You're coming!!

470
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,790
What is this Dakshina?
Why did you have to be so rude to her?

471
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,740
That's how you get what you want!

472
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,300
You better come!!

473
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,540
She would at least look at me
every now and then...

474
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,510
now that's come to
an end too huh?

475
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,030
You deserve this don't you??

476
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,710
lf he suggested a stupid plan,
where was your brains?

477
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,550
What happened uncle?

478
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,910
Hey... come...

479
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,350
l'm talking to myself like a lunatic!

480
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,630
Sir, do you have tickets
for Engeyum Kadhal?

481
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,350
Yeah.

482
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,590
How much is it?

483
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,030
120 bucks! Why?

484
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,870
l want two tickets sir. l came
with my fiancee but didn't get tickets.

485
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,750
l want good corner seats.
Please give me if you have them sir...

486
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,110
l'll pay you an extra
hundred bucks!

487
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,860
Do l look like some idiot to you?

488
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,460
Not at all sir!
Sorry sir!

489
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,870
l'm also waiting for
my fiancee!

490
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,110
Ok sir!
-Get lost!

491
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,910
That's enough... buzz off!!

492
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,670
Are you happy now?

493
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,510
You and your age old ideas...!!

494
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,990
The film would've started.
She won't make it...

495
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,190
Sir? l think so too!

496
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,700
lt's getting delayed.
And it's our first time too. Please!

497
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,950
Get lost....

498
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,510
Money for the tickets sir?
-EnJoy

499
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,430
Thank you!

500
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,110
What are you thinking?

501
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,070
She won't come today.

502
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,110
She won't? Then why
did you suggest this idea?

503
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,790
Otherwise you wouldn't
have proposed to her!

504
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,910
When did l propose?

505
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,600
To say ''l love you'' is old
fashioned...Trend of my era...

506
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,710
To call her out for a movie
is the current trend!

507
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,430
That's ok...
But she hasn't come...

508
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,380
Yeah... she hasn't come!
Why didn't she?

509
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,470
You chalk out the plan
and ask me questions!?

510
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,590
Muruga... non hesitant
girls are a certain kind.

511
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,390
When you call them, to brood over it
for being Judged is another kind.

512
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,470
Such a kind would think about what
a good opportunity they missed...

513
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,030
and her mind will be filled with
thoughts about you the whole day!

514
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,470
Watch out tomorrow...
when she crosses you...

515
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,470
she'll definitely come
and talk to you!

516
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,910
Your love will take off...
And so will the music!

517
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,870
Like that of a kid's heart,

518
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,230
My heart bounces in Joy,
this moment...

519
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,790
lt searched endlessly....
and came looking for you...

520
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,340
lt pleads for infinite
love from you...

521
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,710
lt demands to
see you each day...

522
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,190
And behaves naughty!!

523
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,070
Wherever l go...

524
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:30,150
My love doesn't part with me...
it follows me

525
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,350
Disobeying my words...

526
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,230
lt gives me incessant trouble!

527
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,270
Like that of a kid's heart,

528
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,350
My heart bounces in Joy,
this moment...

529
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,070
lt searched endlessly....
and came looking for you...

530
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,580
lt pleads for infinite
love from you...

531
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,120
lt demands to see
you each day...

532
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,510
And behaves naughty!!

533
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,630
Like a mother's affection
for her child's baby steps...

534
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,110
Love has taken a caring form...
Within me... lately...

535
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,710
Like the first person
to ride me on a piggy back,

536
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,510
l feel the love lift me with affection...
Through day and night...

537
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,030
My brains have
no more intelligence...

538
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,270
And l've gone berserk!

539
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,390
Because you're in there...
my love! always...

540
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,470
Wherever l go...

541
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,020
My love doesn't part with me...
it follows me

542
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,670
Disobeying my words...

543
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,870
lt gives me incessant trouble!

544
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,230
While l'd spent sleepless moments
listening to music...

545
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,430
Asking for hot tea
as l rise for the day...

546
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,830
lt's YOU l'd ask for...
from now on my love!

547
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,630
Even the flowers in
the path you walk...

548
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,910
Gaze at you with amazement!

549
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,390
When it rains,
l'd run to a shelter in fear...

550
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,740
To not drench you
residing in me, my love!

551
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,670
Wherever l go...

552
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,140
My love doesn't part with me...
it follows me

553
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,950
Disobeying my words...

554
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,460
lt gives me incessant trouble!

555
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:46,950
Mam, Just one question.

556
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,470
Mam, we hear you asked for
85 seats with your allied parties.

557
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,550
That's your presumption!

558
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,030
What's your connection
with Wapa of G.R.Builders?

559
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,270
l've never met him!

560
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,950
What do you have to say about

561
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,420
your statement that
none other than...

562
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,350
...your party can
come to power?. -That is true!

563
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,020
How about you becoming
the CM mam?

564
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,750
Who doesn't want to?

565
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,460
Madam, there are charges against you
for land grabbing all over Tamil Nadu!

566
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,190
That's a rumour!

567
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,270
We have the evidence Madam!

568
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,270
You've procured thousands
of acres...

569
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,630
...in Mettupalayam next to
Coimbatore, illegally.

570
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,340
Anticipating the real estate hike,

571
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,350
you used your political
powers to procure it

572
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,180
and announced you'd construct
a bus station there two months ago.

573
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,430
ls this true or not?

574
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,390
NotJust that...

575
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,030
we know why you're delaying the
commencement of sub-urban city proJect.

576
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,750
Shall we?

577
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,830
You go! l'm not coming.

578
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,590
What happened Dakshina?

579
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,070
l'm feeling a bit upset.

580
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,820
lf temples cannot
remove your misery,

581
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,710
then it's time
we call for a beer!

582
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,740
lnstead of asking
him what's wrong...

583
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,670
Oh come on
you crazy girl!

584
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,270
Forget about that!
What happened?

585
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,630
Nothing Muruga!

586
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,630
By saying nothing, if you start
your flash back... then let's get going...

587
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,430
Tomorrow is my wife's
death anniversary.

588
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,710
l always visit the Ashram on this day.

589
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,270
The kids too will be anticipating
my arrival... with so much Joy!

590
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,580
But l can't go.

591
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:49,590
Why?

592
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,150
My son would know that
l'd come for sure.

593
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,190
To go there and come back
without his knowledge is very tough.

594
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,710
To love and take charge of troubles
is what l'm here for!

595
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,030
ls this a problem even?
We're going there tomorrow!

596
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,510
Hello? Who's this?

597
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,670
l'm calling from your
dearest mistress' house!

598
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,230
Don't act smart now!

599
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,510
You're reaching here in the next
ten minutes from wherever you are...

600
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,390
if you don't...

601
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,590
You are coming...

602
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,390
Hello?
- ls this Murugesan?

603
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,830
Who's this?
- Don't ask me questions!

604
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,270
We've kidnapped your son.

605
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,150
Come to Mylapore next to
Kesava Perumal Temple right away.

606
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,620
Whom are you trying to frighten?

607
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:04,990
Yeah... so get some of it now...

608
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,390
Hey! Shout out to your dad!
-Dad...

609
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,390
You heard that?

610
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,470
Hey, don't do anything to him.

611
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:14,910
Tell me dear...

612
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,430
This is not your dear...

613
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,980
Who're you calling from
my sister's phone?

614
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,190
l want to discuss our marriage.
Shall we meet then?

615
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,230
Note down the address...

616
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,390
Hello? Who's this?

617
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,830
Hey! Do you know
whom you're talking to?

618
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,750
lf anything happens to him...

619
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,550
Hello? Who?

620
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,390
Hello?

621
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,310
Your dad's in our custody now...

622
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,230
What?

623
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,430
You dad... we've got him...
Come to where we ask you to.

624
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,950
We're having problems in the family
because of that old bloke.

625
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,470
You can finish him up there!
Put the phone down!

626
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,070
Alert!!!

627
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,180
Come on guys!!

628
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,870
Oh gosh! lt's him!

629
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,470
Where have these guys gone??

630
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,990
Hello sir! How're you?
You came for Madam's death anniversary?

631
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,380
Yeah.
Ok sir.

632
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,580
Bro, are you doing fine?

633
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,750
So... How about you?

634
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,110
So far so good.
l never expected you here!

635
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:39,870
ls that so?

636
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,590
Why didn't you tell us and come?

637
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,030
This old man and you have
been together since then huh?

638
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,630
Yup! Since then!
- Very good!

639
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,830
What's this for?

640
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,710
The boys asked for mangoes...
no... tender coconuts!

641
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,790
l have a soft heart... so...
l'm going to cut some for them!

642
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,790
Bro, do you want a tender coconut?
lt'll be really good. Hang on...

643
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,350
Hey, where have
you guys gone?

644
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,540
Deprived of a mother and of a father,

645
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,230
No soul, certainly,
is an abandoned one here!

646
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,110
To be deprived of kith and kin,

647
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,510
And feel unhappy... is useless....

648
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,950
Oh mother! You're our God...

649
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,070
Words fail to draw equals
to your praises!

650
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:43,750
lt is impossible to find a match
to your love on this planet

651
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:50,510
There is no alternative to you...
Nor anything can replace you.

652
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,030
What is this? Sweet huh?

653
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,310
Don't eat this Grandpa!

654
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,070
Marimuthu uncle, l've told you
not to give him any sweets!

655
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,540
l didn't... someone else did!

656
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,550
lf you eat it...

657
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,310
l was Just holding it...

658
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,630
She's always like that...
Just for fun!

659
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:15,030
What? Latheeswaran?
Have you gone bonkers?

660
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,580
You think he's hero material?

661
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:18,910
lt's a good script bro...

662
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,550
This is notJust about your life,
but mine too...

663
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,270
Hey, will l get this villain
role any other time?

664
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,220
l understand
what you're saying...

665
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,190
But don't rush into it.
Just be patient for a few days...

666
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,110
Only now...
things seem to change...

667
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,710
lt's in process...

668
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,590
Give me a month's time.

669
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,550
l'll come not with 5 crores,
but 10 crores...

670
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,910
and we'll make a massive film!

671
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:46,710
What say?

672
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,230
There you smile finally!

673
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,270
Ok then...

674
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,030
Who was it?

675
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,670
A friend of mine. Works with
Chimbudevan as a co-director

676
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,150
He's got an awesome script.

677
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,830
He's compromised it to work
with that Latheeswaran.

678
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,710
With him?
Who'd come to watch the film?

679
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,670
That's exactly what l said!
Asked him to hang on...

680
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,710
My ex-room mate was trying
hard to crack it in films.

681
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,910
He finally went to Malaysia,
is doing well

682
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,790
for himself and
got settled there.

683
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,030
He's coming here next month.

684
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,740
l'm sure he'll agree to
make a film with me.

685
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,870
Super! Villain sir,
when you make a film,

686
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,470
don't forget
this heroine please!

687
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,030
Let's see!

688
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,710
Let's see huh?

689
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,150
Mani, slow it down...

690
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,190
Stop!

691
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,790
Bro, this is the place...

692
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,390
Only you come along.
- Ok

693
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,750
You too...
-Coming Brother

694
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,430
He's calling you right? Go...

695
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,310
Shut up! l brought him here and
you want me to get beaten up?

696
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,230
Go there and signal me
if he isn't there... and l'll come...

697
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,030
Don't l care about
my body too?

698
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,900
Which room is it?
- That's the one

699
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,620
l'm going mad!!!

700
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,710
Only my smoking expenses keep mounting!
What are you writing continuously?

701
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,950
Sir?
- Yes? What do you want?

702
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,340
There was an old man
who was here... Where's he?

703
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,710
Don't call him an old man.
He's my future producer you know.

704
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,030
By the way, who're you?
- His very close associate.

705
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,270
Where has he gone?

706
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,740
He's gone with Murugan for his shoot.

707
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,190
The rulers of the Villain clan...

708
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,270
Came to bid my value...

709
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,950
And without a conflict...

710
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,990
They agreed to my demands!

711
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,790
Yet l never gave myself to them...

712
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,310
For l did not find the physique l needed!

713
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,550
Money is not big to me!

714
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,510
l am a pricey queen...

715
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,670
For you gotta give me that leverage!

716
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,230
So hug me... and never stop!

717
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,470
Confess my touch leaves
you with a sensation...

718
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,190
Come on' learn your craft on bed!

719
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,860
To acquire the unattainable...
is pleasure...

720
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,270
A goal free life... is pleasure...

721
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,940
Why do we worry about tomorrow?
When today is pleasure!

722
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,470
Curious never-before-asked questions...
... is pleasure...

723
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,750
To see the unseen... is pleasure...

724
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:50,310
To admire our selves... is pleasure...

725
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,670
Beauty is pleasure...

726
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,350
l shall give you pleasure...

727
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,750
lf you touch and not begin...
how's that pleasure?

728
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,190
An irresistible physique is pleasure...

729
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,470
To never drain in bed... is pleasure...

730
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,860
Bravery in the absence of
speed is pointless...

731
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,230
At the stroke of luck,
time by itself, loses it's value!

732
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:50,510
Love without lust is... valueless!

733
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,310
Anger in bed... is meaningless...

734
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,630
A night sans mischief...
is meaningless...

735
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:04,630
And when we're sober...
We're purposeless too...

736
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,670
Touch me not...

737
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,270
Trouble me not!

738
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,670
For l will come myself...
to hug you...

739
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,190
l will grab what l need...
So, don't be hesitant!

740
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,870
Fierce are my kisses...
that will turn you on...

741
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,840
The rulers of the Villain clan...

742
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,470
Came to acquire you...

743
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,460
And without a conflict...

744
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,420
l see they agreed to your demands!

745
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,480
Yet you never gave
yourself to them...

746
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,790
For you did not find
the attainable physique like mine!

747
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,190
Fear is unknown to me!

748
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,470
l agree... you're a pricey queen!

749
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,030
Here l come... to embrace you...
and never stop!

750
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,990
Bro, he's the one... on the bike.

751
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,100
Dakshina, you go the room.
l'll go to the shop and come

752
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,150
lt's raining!

753
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,270
That's alright! lt's Just the rain!

754
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,780
Take the umbrella at least!
-l'll back

755
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,110
Hello?

756
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,900
The old man's son has
come to your house

757
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:47,830
to dupe his dad and seize his property
in the name of the Jewellery shop!

758
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,230
How do you know it?

759
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,790
l'm his accounts person and l'm
the one who prepared the document.

760
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,710
Please don't tell anyone
that l informed you.

761
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:29,870
Grandpa, l guess you don't like that
grandfather story l narrated the other day!

762
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,790
l've made another story.
Based on young people!

763
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,710
The budget is 80 crores.
Full of computer graphics!

764
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,190
lt will out-do 'Robot'!

765
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,830
There's no one to produce it here.
Except you... who has the resources!

766
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,390
lf you allocate Just 80 crores
from the 300 crores of yours...

767
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,990
l will make sure the
amount triples in number!

768
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,150
Where do l have that much cash?
lt's Murugan who funds my food even!

769
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,590
l know it all!.l know you
have assets worth 300 crores!

770
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,390
Food it seems!

771
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,070
You think he's doing it for free?

772
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,070
He'd provide you with food today
and ask for your assets later.

773
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,390
But l'm being frank about it today!

774
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,270
Don't bad mouth about Murugan!
- Who me?

775
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,700
Tell me how would l know you're
worth 300 crores?

776
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,470
He was the one who said

777
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,380
''You think l'm a fool to provide
for an old man like him?...''

778
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,070
... He said he's chalking out a plan to
settle in life by acquiring your assets!!

779
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,590
Hey give me a month's time...

780
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,830
l'll come not with 5 crores, but 10 crores...
and we'll make a massive film!

781
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,310
l swear on my mom he said it!

782
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,790
Bro, he left the house because of you.
You think he'll come back now?

783
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,470
lt's very easy to dupe fathers.

784
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,590
lf he see's his son weeping,
his heart will melt!

785
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,190
Check out my act now!

786
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,790
Dad!!

787
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,230
Get up! Get up!

788
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,150
Why're you crying
like a small child?

789
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,030
Dad, l know l shouldn't have
asked for the Ashram. Forgive me!

790
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:51,270
l've got this MLA seat with great
difficulty. Only if l spend money can l win.

791
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,300
Please give me the Jewellery
store alone. That's enough!

792
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,550
l won't ask you for anything more!

793
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:04,150
When strangers can eye on my assets,
it's in your birthright to ask.

794
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,550
Except for the Ashram,
l'll transfer all

795
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,430
the assets to your
name tomorrow.

796
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,030
Dad... thank you!

797
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,590
Careful dad...

798
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,350
Tell me...

799
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:18,070
We're leaving with the old man now.
We can have the registration tomorrow.

800
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,670
Ok. Call me once it's done.

801
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,270
Stop that!

802
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,300
Who're you to raise
your hand on my son?

803
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,630
He's trying to dupe you!

804
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,230
Shut up!

805
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,710
Unlike you, he only asked for his own
dad's assets, not on someone else's!

806
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,550
What? l wanted your assets?

807
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,140
Shanmugam told me everything!

808
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,950
You could've asked me straight away
if you wanted money...

809
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,990
You backstabbed me by
buttering so much love!

810
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,790
What l told Shanmugam was...

811
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,510
Don't mince words now...
l feel ashamed to stand in front of you!

812
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,110
Please listen to me first!
-Get Lost!

813
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,070
He's going to dupe you in the
name of the Jewellery store!

814
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,870
Don't trust him.

815
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,060
He's going to bring you and
the kids to the road.

816
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,190
How did you know this?

817
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:18,750
l knew it some how.

818
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,670
You're right.
l am going to dupe him.

819
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,750
Don't act smart.

820
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,390
Yes, they're all going to be homeless,
once the registration is done.

821
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,470
Come and fetch them then...

822
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,630
lt's not your father who's
going to come to the road... but you!

823
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,470
There is no man who's lived
a full life by cheating his own parents!

824
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,470
This registration won't happen.
Poor you!

825
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,870
You know who's buying the property?

826
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:44,710
Who?

827
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,550
MMEK Party Leader Akka!

828
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,470
You can't do a thing!

829
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,230
Look... leave alone your Akka...

830
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,270
even if it's God himself...

831
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,710
l won't let this happen!

832
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,180
Anull, one minute.
- Yeah?

833
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,670
l wasn't aware of Grandpa's
full story, forgive me!

834
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:41,350
lt's ok!

835
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,790
lf l'd known it involved kids,
l wouldn't have opened my mouth!

836
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,670
lt's my fault too.
l shouldn't have said that to you!

837
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,870
l know you're all heading
out for Grandpa's sake.

838
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,990
lf you don't mind, please utilize
my brains too for this operation!

839
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:55,950
Please Anull!

840
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,030
Sure. You can Join us.

841
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,350
But please keep
your brains to yourself!!

842
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:04,870
Please bro!!

843
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,390
Brother?

844
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,150
Come on guys... let's go...

845
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,990
lt's ok... l'll come...
Lets go boys!

846
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,470
You're not embarrassed are you?
- Then how would l get an award?

847
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:30,510
Shall we?

848
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,630
Akka's guy Masilamani
isn't here yet.

849
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,470
l've spoken to him.
He should be here in ten minutes.

850
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,510
Dad, you stay in the car.
l'll call you when we're ready.

851
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,070
Will Akka come here?

852
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,700
No she won't. She'd send across
some third hand dealer.

853
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:54,990
Why isn't she answering the phone?

854
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,270
Bro, Masilamani is here!

855
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:06,030
There he comes! No third
hand dealer, but a Tsunami!!!

856
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:07,350
Why is he coming here?

857
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,390
ls this the time for your doubts?

858
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,580
Not me!

859
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,270
Why has he come here?

860
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,790
To do a secret wedding, looks like.

861
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,070
Why should he come here for that?

862
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,110
Secret wedding are usually
done in some place else.

863
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,670
We'll do the registration
once he's done. - Ok dad.

864
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,390
Follow them.

865
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,070
Ok brother!

866
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,630
Tell me brother.

867
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,510
Keep an eye on what's
happening inside. - Ok.

868
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:58,710
Come along...

869
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,110
Sorry, has it got late?

870
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,470
Not at all.

871
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,070
This is our lawyer. Shall we?

872
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,350
Give me a few minutes.

873
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,230
My boys have gone inside on some work...
let them come back and we'll proceed.

874
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,270
Dad's here. We'll complete all the
formalities with him around.

875
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,310
Hey, what were
they doing at the back?

876
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,350
They Just came around.

877
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,630
And did what?

878
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:40,830
That's all they did!

879
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,710
That's all?

880
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,190
What is this?

881
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,150
Sweets, they distributed it inside.

882
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:47,990
Something seems strange...

883
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,150
l ate it, seems fine!

884
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,270
l have a feeling he's got some plan!

885
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,870
Please keep the money inside.
You haven't brought any evidences!

886
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,100
There's a lot of risk involved.

887
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,110
What is more risky
than marriage itself?

888
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,270
Mam, please accept this 5000 bucks...

889
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,150
Please follow what l say sir.

890
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,070
We can't do a registration
without a family card.

891
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,190
Madam please...
accept this money.

892
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,550
l know it's wrong to not carry
the family card. Please adJust.

893
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,190
How much do you offer finally?

894
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,950
Bro, give me that!
Madam, there's ten thousand in this.

895
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,020
Your sincerity is appreciated!

896
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,510
This is way too less! Don't leak the news
that l accepted such a small amount!

897
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,310
Leak? Us?

898
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,420
Of course not!

899
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:28,870
But we'll click a photograph though!

900
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,390
Sir, what's going on?
Why is he taking a picture?

901
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,230
Switch off the camera!

902
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,270
We're from the vigilance department.

903
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,990
We're arresting you on
charges of bribery.

904
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,350
Sir, l'm really sorry.
l won't do this again.

905
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,630
Get going Madam.
Go!

906
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,790
Sir, we've arrested the registrar.

907
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:56,870
Hey fools!

908
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,830
We wore prison uniforms before
we wore our school uniforms!

909
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,190
We don't know what fear is!

910
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,620
Get going!
Let some breeze come in...

911
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:03,590
Come on darling!

912
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,940
So you went to prison
when you were a kid?

913
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,870
Oh my! l was trying to give a
good finish to this scene!

914
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,070
Anull, l didn't expect such
a twist in this scene!

915
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,430
l have a small obligation,
can l use this scene for my script?

916
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,670
Please! Thanks!

917
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,510
Didn't l tell you guys to be alert?

918
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,190
Did you pay attention to what l said?

919
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,390
Don't you eat your damn
Biriyani thrice a day?

920
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,510
Silly me, got sweets from him!!?

921
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,910
When they went around...
that's all they did is it?

922
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,270
Hey, you're running away so
you can escape some thumps?

923
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,830
Hang on bro,
l'll bring him back.

924
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:47,990
And you follow him to escape too?

925
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,380
Trust me Akka, l had everything
sorted to trick my dad

926
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,910
But this guy intruded
and goofed it up!

927
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,350
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

928
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,510
When you enter politics, you need
to be cautious even with a child!

929
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,070
ls this the guy you were
talking about?

930
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,150
You're Murugan right?
Your screen name is Anull Murugan

931
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,470
and you make a living by
doing roles for 500 and 1000's!

932
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,830
To become a villain is your dream.

933
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,350
And... you're in love with this girl
from that close-by hostel.

934
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,950
ls that right?

935
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,950
This is my issue!

936
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,990
One more time l see you interfere
with this land dealing....

937
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,310
... do yourJob alone! Get lost!

938
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,950
He won't mess with us anymore!

939
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:11,870
Wapa is on the line.

940
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,150
Tell me Wapa.

941
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,510
What happened to the land deal?

942
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,350
Only the Ashram is pending.

943
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,470
Will it take longer?
My client is waiting.

944
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,190
No. lt will be sealed in
the next two days.

945
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:20,910
Ok Madam.

946
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,160
We can't trust him.
Abduct his girl friend

947
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,310
and let him know about it.

948
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:31,870
You go along too.

949
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,630
While he searches for her,
seal the registration.

950
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,300
Open this. Get me the cigarette.

951
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,190
Tell me bro...

952
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,430
Even if you give him directions
to get here, he can't find out this place.

953
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,350
Hello? Where are you?
Which area are you in?

954
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:00,830
l don't know.

955
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,820
Check your phone
display and tell me.

956
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:04,790
Saidapet.

957
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,020
Ok. What do you see outside?

958
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,070
l can only see the street lamp
through the window.

959
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,710
That's enough! l'll be there!

960
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,110
Saidapet

961
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,310
Tell me if the power goes off?
-Ok

962
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:09,550
lt's back.

963
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,820
Darshini, don't panic.

964
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,830
l'll look for the street.
Stay on the line.

965
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,070
Did it go off?
- No

966
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,190
Now?
- No

967
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,830
Now?
- Yeah. lt went off!

968
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,390
ls it on now?
- Yeah.

969
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,030
Ok, this is the street.

970
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,220
Hello? One minute!

971
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,750
Did it go off?
- No.

972
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,310
Now?
- No.

973
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:47,950
Yeah... now it did.

974
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,750
Didn't you hear something?

975
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,950
Why do you fret?
He can't get here!

976
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,630
Ask one of them to go and check...

977
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,790
Why're you so scared?
l'll go and check myself!

978
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,350
Who can change if this is his fate?

979
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,870
There he goes... with his stunts!

980
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:57,870
Time for us to duck down!

981
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,100
Why're you hiding here?
Aren't you ashamed of doing this?

982
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,860
lf we think of shame,
we can't escape from him.

983
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,310
Wrap yourself with a cloth!

984
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,910
How come l didn't think of this?

985
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,230
That's it now!

986
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,620
Enough! Don't over act!
What happened to you?

987
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,030
Only if l act, could l hug you!!

988
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,430
Why did you move?

989
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,430
Sorry bro!

990
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:35,910
What if he finds us?

991
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:36,790
Who's there?

992
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,790
He didn't spot us!!!

993
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:54,070
He spotted us but let us free!
He's a good guy!

994
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,390
Oh droplets of dew...
on the flower so beautiful!

995
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,950
My heart is floating in the air!

996
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,470
lt's going Topsy-turvy...

997
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,230
With a possessed feeling
upon seeing you...

998
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:37,190
Oh island of love...
burning with desire...

999
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,790
Without making it obvious,

1000
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,630
l'm gasping for breath
upon seeing you!

1001
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:47,630
Don't imitate a spirit...

1002
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:52,830
By hopping free and entering my body!

1003
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,670
My eyes sparkle...
my heart bursts...

1004
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,150
My blood boils...
in the spirit of love!

1005
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,710
lt screams...
turns my cheeks the color red,

1006
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,350
And this love...
drains me like in sickness!

1007
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,950
Oh droplets of dew...
on the flower so beautiful!

1008
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,030
My heart is floating in the air!

1009
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,790
lt's going topsy-turvy...

1010
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,430
With a possessed feeling
upon seeing you...

1011
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,190
Oh dear! Before you
set your eyes on me...

1012
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,980
l used to live like
a lifeless stone!

1013
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,190
When your eyes met me...

1014
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,830
l became a measuring
stone with value...

1015
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,470
Before you conversed with me,

1016
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,910
l was a dumb chump!

1017
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,550
After l heard your words...

1018
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,870
l flourished into a new
book of literature!

1019
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:32,590
l hadn't known myself earlier!

1020
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,830
Today, l'm a 'know-all' saint!

1021
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:39,980
When l think of you...

1022
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:40,990
The cells of my body
glitters like stars!

1023
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,790
My eyes sparkle...
my heart bursts...

1024
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,190
My blood boils...
in the spirit of love!

1025
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,910
lt screams... turns
my cheeks the color red,

1026
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,430
And this love...
drains me like in sickness!

1027
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:28,390
l was like the*******,
Wilting within their barbed confines...

1028
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,670
But with your love,
l will evolve into a country of my own!

1029
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,910
The gravitational force of the world,
Was measured by millions!

1030
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,510
When l told them about
your mesmerizing pull...

1031
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,150
Many a people were
knocked down right then!

1032
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:49,070
We will find a purpose
to the existence of our eyes!

1033
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:54,430
We will find a purpose
to the existence of our hands...

1034
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,830
But when our souls merge...
There is no reason to Justify it!

1035
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,510
My eyes sparkle...
my heart bursts...

1036
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,990
My blood boils...
in this spirit of love!

1037
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,750
lt screams...
turns my cheeks the color red,

1038
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,150
And this love...
drains me like in sickness!

1039
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:39,950
Anull, the cars have started.
Grandpa is in the second vehicle.

1040
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,990
Master, is our fighter ok?

1041
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,310
Don't worry. He's a sport!

1042
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,110
That's why l told Shanmugam that.

1043
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,310
But you misunderstood me...

1044
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:39,630
He's right. You're about to transfer
the Ashram not the store.

1045
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:42,510
l was forced to write that agreement
for the fear of your son...

1046
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:43,510
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1047
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,030
Grandpa!

1048
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,230
What happened Dakshina?

1049
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,430
Say something...

1050
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,310
Look here... what's wrong?

1051
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:10,310
He took my signature at the temple itself,
before we reached the register office.

1052
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,470
l misunderstood you Muruga!

1053
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,110
Forgive me!

1054
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,830
Forget about it!
This is no big deal.

1055
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:35,230
You Just signed right?

1056
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:35,950
Get up!

1057
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,310
This is no big deal!
We'll take care of it.

1058
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:41,110
Help him get up.

1059
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,550
Don't fear such things...

1060
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,710
Don't worry.

1061
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:49,990
What's up?

1062
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,070
Akka's guys are bringing
down the Ashram!

1063
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,750
When a flood strikes,
where shall it go?

1064
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,110
Undoubtedly merges with flowing
rivers, for there are many...

1065
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,510
ln distress,
where does the soul go?

1066
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:36,110
For there are abundant temples,
to keep beliefs intact...

1067
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:40,190
This being our only temple,

1068
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:44,830
When we part from this temple
of ours, where shall we go?

1069
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,790
Where shall we go?

1070
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:56,630
Hello sir!

1071
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,910
Dad, please forgive me!

1072
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:14,910
l've paid a big price
for cheating you.

1073
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,820
After the Ashram documents
were transferred,

1074
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:23,750
l went in Joy to Akka's office
to talk about the MLA seat.

1075
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:29,070
But her goons didn't let me in,
they quarreled with me.

1076
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,780
That's when l realized
she'd betrayed me

1077
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:39,310
She put false charges and
got me arrested too!

1078
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:56,030
Dad, l don't want this politics!
Please bail me out!

1079
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,910
You've cut off from your evil compay
then this is no big deal!

1080
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:03,950
l'll take care of it.

1081
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:10,830
Hello bro!
-Hello

1082
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:11,950
How're you doing today?

1083
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,830
Good! And you?

1084
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:14,670
Not any good!

1085
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:22,470
l live with a compact family...
As per government rules...

1086
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:23,950
My boss has turned
into a good guy now.

1087
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,710
Who'll give us
our daily allowances?

1088
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:30,190
Who'll take care of my family?
You have to find me a solution!

1089
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,030
Nice performance!

1090
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,870
Looks like you already have a plan,
suggest what you want.

1091
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:41,430
Make me a gym-boy in cinema!
You know l get bashed up pretty well!

1092
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,150
You? Capable of getting bashed up?

1093
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,860
Cinema needs fake actors like you!

1094
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,510
And you qualify for it!

1095
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,430
Thanks!
- Welcome!

1096
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,670
l've qualified as a gym-boy
without going to the gym!

1097
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:06,590
lt's Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and
Hollywood in that order!

1098
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:07,900
But you don't now any English bro!

1099
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,190
You haven't heard me speak English?

1100
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:11,990
Going still??!!
- Bro!!

1101
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:14,630
Take my snaps!!

1102
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:25,230
who sacrificed her life for
the welfare of the city - Akka!

1103
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:38,270
On behalf of the numerous followers here,
l welcome the one and only woman,

1104
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:44,310
Akka!

1105
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,110
Hey Kutti Rani!

1106
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,510
Akka, l need to talk to you.

1107
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,430
lsn't your real name Kutti Rani?

1108
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,880
Weren't you involved with a brothel
at Silk Pettai when you were 15?

1109
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,270
You got hold of a counselor who
came for your service...

1110
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,630
later got hold of an MLA through him
and settled as his mistress??!

1111
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,550
After which your MLA
became a minister.

1112
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,710
And... your tricks turned into politics!

1113
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,630
You pushed him to start his own party

1114
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,790
and seeing it's growth you killed him
and acquired his place today! Poor him!

1115
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,550
You're one heavy weight throwing
around your weight in politics!

1116
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,750
You know how many of them
are homeless because of you?

1117
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,790
Poor kids of that Ashram...
how did they harm you?

1118
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,670
The Ashram was their parent
in the absence of their real parents!

1119
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:45,470
You ruined that too huh?

1120
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,830
You will... someday... lay lifeless...
on those same streets!

1121
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,260
Are you trying to threaten me?

1122
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,100
Challenging you!

1123
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:58,110
What'd you say that day?
Do what you're supposed to!

1124
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:03,710
l came to play a villain in cinema...
But l'm your villain in real life!

1125
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:06,870
Watch my 'film' from now!

1126
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:13,670
Who're you guys?

1127
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,110
What's happening there?

1128
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,790
lf you shout, l'll stab you.

1129
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:24,710
You're mistaken if you think you can

1130
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,510
stop your property from being sold
if you attack me.

1131
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:31,350
You saw my house right? l'm a dummy!
There's no use if you kill me.

1132
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,990
Akka does the execution.
Only Wapa is the deciding authority.

1133
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,550
lf there's anyone you
have to attack, it's only Wapa.

1134
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,870
Wapa... who's he?

1135
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,700
Wapa is Akka's shadow.

1136
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:46,140
The minute we third hand dealers
get the property, its under his control.

1137
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,470
He takes care of land dealing,
transferring money to Swiss banks,

1138
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,710
expenses during elections and
murders who behave rough with Akka!

1139
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,350
Only the sea has count of
the number of people he's killed.

1140
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:01,590
Try attacking him.
lf you do, you'll get your Ashram.

1141
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,710
But it isn't easy.

1142
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,110
He portrays a good-man-image
and has strong support for himself!

1143
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,270
Even if there are a thousand bones
in a fish, Just one hook chokes its throat.

1144
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,230
l'm your Wapa's hook
and his fish bone!

1145
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:05,110
You think you can walk about freely
after you've killed my father?

1146
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:06,830
l won't spare you anymore!

1147
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,830
lf you have the guts,
face me by yourself.

1148
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:15,910
Who do you think you're talking to?

1149
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:10,670
Throw them out!

1150
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,980
Anull, l don't think we
can kidnap him here.

1151
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:20,700
l'll do it right here...
in this market.

1152
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:22,780
The AC is very low in the caravan!

1153
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,270
Come soon sir...

1154
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,150
Wow! What a crowd!

1155
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,750
There's no one up there sir!

1156
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,350
ls this crowd for me?

1157
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:35,020
The market is usually very crowded!

1158
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:41,830
Give me your hand!
l'm the hero of this film!

1159
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,030
You want my autograph?

1160
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,790
lt's my school notes!
Please let me go. l gotta go for class.

1161
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:49,590
He escaped!

1162
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:52,270
That boy is pretty strong!

1163
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,350
And you're very weak!

1164
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,240
l'm shooting all my sequences
in this market!

1165
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:57,590
Why?

1166
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,950
At least l get some crowd here,
unlike my empty theatre shows!

1167
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:03,540
Superb sir!

1168
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:09,470
We have a passionate scene in our film,
l don't think we can shoot that in here!

1169
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:13,390
lf this crowd is born out of that passion,
it's not wrong to film it here!

1170
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,230
Sir, the situation is such that...

1171
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:21,990
l'm the one and only man behind
the story, screenplay, dialogues,

1172
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:25,310
music direction, lyrics, cinematography
and production of this film.

1173
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:28,470
l've come to this goon's place,
who killed my mother...

1174
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,510
and l fight with him shooting
my usual punch dialogues!

1175
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,500
You know, l'm producing this film...

1176
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,110
from the money l earned by
selling mangoes at Maldives!

1177
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:41,270
l should either go back with my money
or least... with the mangoes.

1178
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,440
Or else...

1179
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:43,390
Else he'd go with the seed
of a mango!

1180
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,340
Who's that now?

1181
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,470
What are you looking at me for?

1182
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,020
Sir, it's getting late.
Please start!

1183
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:54,710
So... the mango seed... gosh!!

1184
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,230
Sir, you drive fast and stop the car...

1185
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:59,500
Opened the door... got down...

1186
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,070
You come running in slow motion...

1187
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,670
And you see your mother dead...

1188
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,830
You are angry... furious...

1189
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,870
You look up and see the villain...
and 20 of his thugs!

1190
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,470
The fight starts from there...

1191
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,910
Who's he?
With a sickle in mid air?

1192
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,830
What's he doing?
Where's he going?

1193
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:19,310
lsn't the lift working?

1194
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,060
What are you doing sir?

1195
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:30,420
Sorry master...
we'll move on to the close up now!

1196
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:35,550
What's happening there?

1197
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,790
That's a plan to attack Wapa.

1198
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,390
Why? Did he fall down or something?

1199
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:40,670
They're gonna abduct him!!!

1200
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,390
Ask them to do it after l leave...

1201
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:45,870
lf we tell them,
they'll abduct you too.

1202
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,340
Ok... ready! One more...

1203
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,990
Sir, please smile and turn...

1204
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,030
Some more sir...

1205
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,830
Dude, Wapa is coming here...

1206
01:36:59,360 --> 01:36:59,990
He's here too huh?

1207
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,230
Here... right here... l won't leave this
place without taking a dump here!

1208
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,510
Am l the director or are you?

1209
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,150
You can't deliver a dialogue
but you question me?

1210
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,110
Who's that?

1211
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,230
That guy who acted in
that film Takkar? He's the hero.

1212
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:18,670
Why is this guy so enthusiastic??

1213
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,430
What are standing there for?
Stand here...

1214
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:25,950
Give me some spray...

1215
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:27,420
You don't need any!

1216
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,830
Pass this take at least!

1217
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,390
Sorry mommy!
Please bear with me!

1218
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,990
What are you looking at?
Get Wapa into the vehicle!

1219
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,670
Good plan!

1220
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,500
Yeah, the plan worked out good!

1221
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,110
Yogi, don't get scared...

1222
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,110
Come on guys!

1223
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:29,870
He abducted Wapa...
in his own area... how could he?

1224
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:35,390
lf Wapa opens his mouth,
l'm dead meat!

1225
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,950
He's showing me his tricks huh?

1226
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:40,820
Cinematic fool!

1227
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,150
Search thoroughly...

1228
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:55,750
Get going...

1229
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:27,790
Bundle him up!

1230
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,550
We are the ones, who act smart,
someone to out-do us huh?

1231
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:32,910
500 gym boys are around!

1232
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,780
Anull, we've bundled up all
these guys as you said.

1233
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:47,270
What do we do with them?

1234
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:49,670
Show them around Bombay...

1235
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,270
Bihar and bring them back
when l tell you to.

1236
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,070
Why have you brought me here?

1237
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:57,830
CBl Enquiry.

1238
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:11,950
What wrong did l do?
Why have you arrested me?

1239
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:23,270
Land mafia, land grabbing,
your association with Akka...

1240
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,310
and the murders you've
committed for her...

1241
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:29,590
why did you?

1242
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:36,630
Come on... we're all ears!

1243
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,430
Whatever it is,
call my lawyer...

1244
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,910
He fled the city once
we arrested you.

1245
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,430
The search the on!

1246
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:45,510
Co-operate with us!

1247
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:50,190
What's your name?

1248
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:51,550
Where are you from?

1249
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:54,350
Where's your family?

1250
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:00,910
What's your connection
with Akka (older sister)?

1251
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:03,830
l don't have an older sister.
Only younger!

1252
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,390
Joke huh? Nice!

1253
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:25,190
What's the connection between
the Politician Akka and you?

1254
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,950
Any physical... pain?

1255
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:33,950
Akka?

1256
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:37,070
l don't know who she is!

1257
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,670
Abdul... l'm a Muslim
Just like you are.

1258
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:53,390
This is for your own good.
Spill out the truth!

1259
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:54,430
No!!

1260
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,230
Did he come up with
something bro?

1261
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:01,470
l don't think he'd say a word
even if the actual CBl was here.

1262
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,710
Ok, l gotta leave.

1263
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,110
l'm doing a cop's role in
Gautham Menon's film.

1264
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,750
My car's waiting... l'll push off!

1265
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:09,430
Thanks bro!

1266
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:10,950
Bro, what shall we do now?

1267
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:14,020
What else, we'll call for
the special officer then!

1268
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:34,790
Mr. Khader... Abdul Khader...
Good morning. lt's daytime.

1269
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:36,740
l'm Unnikrishnan.

1270
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:44,990
7299026293.
Who's number is this?

1271
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:46,540
lt's mine.

1272
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:50,830
9841944339.

1273
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,390
Did you get a call from
this number this month?

1274
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:55,910
No

1275
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:59,230
Good memory!
Sure not! Because it's my number!

1276
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:09,430
9841393548 - You've got a call from
this number very often.

1277
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:11,470
lt's an unknown number.

1278
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:14,270
But you don't have this number
on your phone memory.

1279
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:17,510
But you do have it in this memory!

1280
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:21,590
This is Akka's number.

1281
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,150
Ok. Take rest. l'll take leave!

1282
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:31,470
Morning. My name is Robert!

1283
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:36,310
There is a property in Anna Nagar
that belongs to you?

1284
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:52,590
Why do you torture us by
saying you know nothing?

1285
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:01,190
You claim that you don't
know who Akka is.

1286
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:02,620
What... is this some plan
of both of you?

1287
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:04,950
So you agree that you know her?

1288
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:36,040
Sir, l hear you haven't uttered a word
to any of the officers earlier?

1289
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:40,270
You think you're being smart?

1290
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:47,710
Police officers handle an enquiry
pretty rough...

1291
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:52,150
Where as CBl officers....
Lights off!

1292
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:53,630
Switch off the lights.

1293
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:59,110
Don't hit me!

1294
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:06,190
Lights on!

1295
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:11,390
CBl Officers don't hit.

1296
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,350
We are supposed to
handle the case softly.

1297
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:19,230
So please co-operate with us.

1298
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:21,550
Don't trust him.

1299
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,220
He put off the lights and hit me!!

1300
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:25,430
He's acting!

1301
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:26,710
He hit me!

1302
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,300
Only the lights came on,
not the camera

1303
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,070
lf you are ready to talk the truth,
the camera will be turned on.

1304
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:38,310
Or else, lights will go off
Just like how it did now!

1305
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:39,590
What do you prefer?

1306
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,390
l know Akka.

1307
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:43,670
There you go!!

1308
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:47,390
She came to me to
sell a piece of land 10 years ago...

1309
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:51,230
l know her since then.

1310
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,110
l've committed various
crimes for her.

1311
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:54,380
From land grabbing to quarrels to

1312
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:57,470
disputes, murders...
many such similar crimes.

1313
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:02,150
l even killed that Keeran's Journalist
recently because she asked me to.

1314
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:04,910
Hello and good morning!
Today's flash news:

1315
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,590
Wapa of G.R Developers is under
the custody of the police.

1316
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,460
He has reported against Ranganayaki.

1317
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:13,710
l've said it many times before.
l don't have anything to do with Wapa.

1318
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:16,070
Sir, Akka claims she doesn't
have anything to do with Wapa.

1319
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:19,790
ls she pure enough to admit the truth?
l have evidences for everything.

1320
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:20,750
Wait till tomorrow...

1321
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:33,630
What does it look like Bro?
Will Akka get arrested?

1322
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:35,830
ln spite of these evidences,
they haven't arrested her yet.

1323
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:37,470
You think they can do itJust
because they've got evidences?

1324
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,670
l hear there's some connection
between Akka and Wapa!

1325
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:41,790
Don't spread rumors!

1326
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:45,190
Wait and watch...
she's got some strong support.

1327
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:52,950
The victims of the land grabbing case
have come forward by themselves,

1328
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,750
When we spoke to the CM
about this:

1329
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:56,990
''We're not hiding anything.

1330
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,470
lf she has done wrong,
she will face the repercussions of it.''

1331
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:13,390
With the evidence of the videotape
provided by Wapa a.k.a Abdul Khader,

1332
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,220
it has been proved that
land grabbing has taken place.

1333
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:23,350
Hence, the court demands Rangakayaki
a.k.a Akka to appear this Friday.

1334
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,150
Hello? Madam asked me to call.
Can you pass on the phone to her?

1335
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,390
lt's been so long.
When are you going to release me?

1336
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:48,070
We're not releasing you anywhere!

1337
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:52,910
Are you going to kill me?

1338
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:58,060
Does Madam know about this?

1339
01:53:58,360 --> 01:53:59,950
Madam is on the line. Talk to her!

1340
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:03,870
Hello?
- Just die Wapa.

1341
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:05,430
Madam?

1342
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:07,060
Only if you die can l escape.
l don't have a choice.

1343
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:12,270
l don't have the time to sympathize.
You better die!

1344
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:22,140
Mam... no... why should l...
what did l do?

1345
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:27,590
Hello? Mam?

1346
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:30,030
Kill yourself sir!

1347
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:31,630
l will not!

1348
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,630
You have to...
there's no other choice.

1349
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:57,430
lf you harm my family...

1350
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:59,510
lf you don't want us to... then...

1351
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:17,830
l deserve this and more...
for trusting Madam!

1352
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:29,620
G.R.Builders Wapa dies a
mysterious death in prison.

1353
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,510
lnvestigations are on if it's
a suicide or murder.

1354
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:35,190
When we asked for
people's opinions:

1355
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:38,230
l don't think it's suicide.
lt's a planned murder.

1356
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:40,580
When has the corrupt politician
got caught?

1357
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:42,230
Only his associates face such trouble.

1358
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:44,550
Akka's target this time was Wapa.

1359
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:49,660
Protestors against Akka crowded
outside the court today...

1360
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:59,790
Grandpa, when can we go home?
- Very soon!

1361
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:34,030
When l come out,
create a ruckus and kill him.

1362
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:43,950
This seems to me like an
obvious attempt against Ms. Rangakayaki.

1363
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:49,110
l request the court to investigate and
punish the accused responsible for this.
