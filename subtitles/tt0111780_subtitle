1
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,560
Turn the car around. Okay?

2
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,720
You, Lakdhawala?

3
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,280
Chunawala.

4
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,240
Right code word.

5
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,280
It is very difficult
to conduct business with you.

6
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,760
I have been trying to supply goods
to you for the past six months.

7
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,880
Before doing business,
we inquire about the person

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,080
as well as the goods.

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,760
Show me the goods.

10
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,880
The goods are on the way.
You show me the currency.

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,360
The currency is also on the way.

12
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,840
Good. That fat guy is speaking
exactly like the smugglers.

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,640
They don't know that
we are police officers.

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,080
The plan is successful.
I shall inform Sir.

15
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,360
The quality is very good.

16
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,720
Why haven't your
goods arrived yet?

17
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,280
It's already here.

18
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,880
Look over there. Above you.

19
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,480
I really enjoyed
doing business with you.

20
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,560
Vijay, open the bonnet.
Hurry up! Hurry up!

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,640
Hurry up! Open it. What happened?

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,000
He will not be able
to open the bonnet.

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,040
There are handcuffs on his hands.

24
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,800
Put your guns down
and put your hands up!

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
Don't move, inspector.

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,640
If we die, then we shall
take you along with us.

27
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,560
Well, I am not fond of living either.

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,720
Let's make the final
journey along with you.

29
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,240
If you were to show me your faces

30
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,760
then it would be
easier to recognize each other

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,400
on our way to hell.

32
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,200
After all, we all have to
go to the same place. Right?

33
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,520
Sir, Anil, Vijay and Majit.
They have killed everyone.

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,920
They are all dead, sir.

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,160
Hey, rascals! Allow me
to pick up the pistol at least.

36
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,360
He is cheating.

37
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,080
You scum!

38
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,000
Now I shall teach them a lesson.

39
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,440
Who teaches these imbeciles?

40
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,880
-You are okay, right?
-I am fine.

41
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,240
They have all run away.

42
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,880
If I had gotten a hold of them
then I would have killed them.

43
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,880
Ambulance. Hospital!
Hospital! Let's go.

44
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,080
The minister is here.
Hurry up! Come.

45
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,240
Welcome, sir. Welcome to the bank.

46
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,680
Come, Mr. Ragunath.

47
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,240
-Let's go.
-Please sir.

48
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
In this bank,
not only famous rich bureaucrats

49
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,920
deposit their money,
but the jewelry and the money

50
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,240
of the famous Goddess temple
is also deposited over here.

51
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,960
The public has deposited up to four
or five crore rupees in our bank.

52
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,320
Safe and secure.

53
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,080
-Oh! I see.
-Please. Come this way.

54
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,400
These are the bank vaults.
There are cameras on every corner.

55
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Every person who comes in
or goes out, his photo is clicked.

56
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,800
This is the control panel

57
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,960
that prepares a special type of
red-colored ultrasonic rays.

58
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,880
Without turning off this system,
trying to cross it means death.

59
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,000
Hey! It has vanished.

60
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,520
Hey! This is a very dangerous
arrangement, Khanna.

61
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,480
Don't worry. I will switch it off.

62
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,640
-Hey! This is amazing, minister sir.
-Yes, come.

63
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,880
And in all this computerized
security system

64
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,320
there are four
specialized people.

65
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,280
Until all four of them don't
enter their computer codes

66
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,840
one after the other,
the vault doesn't open until then.

67
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,760
Wow!
This is a very fabulous thing.

68
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,640
But Khanna, tell me something.

69
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,600
I am not well educated,
but I know at least this much,

70
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,240
that if one of the four men falls sick,
what happens then?

71
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,160
Then I am there, right?

72
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,800
I have everybody's computer codes.

73
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,680
-Really?
-Yes.

74
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,760
Raghunath, you are one
of Khanna's closest friends.

75
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,160
Are you seeing all these
arrangements for the first time?

76
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,160
-Yes.
-This is all confidential, sir.

77
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,360
The friendship is in its place
and the duty is in its place.

78
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,520
Very good.

79
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,520
You may leave.

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,400
Khanna...

81
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,640
This box contains the money,

82
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,040
which I had spoken to you about.
500 crores.

83
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,560
And Minister sir wishes to keep
all this money here

84
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
until the next election.

85
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,200
I have understood, sir.
You don't worry at all.

86
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,600
Your money and your words
are with me. Safe and secure.

87
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,440
Come, my darling. Come.

88
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
-Raghu darling.
-Darling!

89
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,720
No. You are very desperate.

90
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,080
Let me breathe at least.

91
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,440
It has been three months
since I have known you.

92
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,680
Since then I have been breathing.

93
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,920
You did not allow me
to do anything until today.

94
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,080
-At least let me kiss you once today.
-No. No.

95
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,960
Let us speak about work.

96
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,880
Whatever I had said, has
proved to be the truth, right?

97
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,400
The meaning of crossing
the security system

98
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,520
of the bank is death.

99
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,280
I am not well educated,
but I know at least this much...

100
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,240
that I have contacts
with such brilliant people.

101
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,080
who will wipe out all
the money from Laxmi bank.

102
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
-And they won't even leave any evidence.
-Yes.

103
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,120
Who are they?

104
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,680
General Raghuvansh.
Colonel Biswas. Commander Mushtaq.

105
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,320
They have all retired
but they are very active.

106
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,880
Who could guess that
these three terrorists

107
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,520
are also respected
citizens of this society?

108
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,160
You have praised us a lot, minister.

109
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,200
Tell me why you are here?

110
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,920
I am not well educated,
but I know at least this much...

111
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,480
that you will be
amazed to hear about it.

112
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,120
We have to steal the Laxmi bank.

113
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,600
-What?
-Is it a joke to steal from Laxmi bank?

114
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,040
Hey! I know it.
I know it very well.

115
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,560
That is why, I have come
to the masters. Right, Sheela?

116
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,520
Yes. Chairman Jagdish Khanna.

117
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,760
The person who is
the key to that bank

118
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,160
he is a lover,
trapped in my plan.

119
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,680
If you are interested, then
I shall explain the scheme further.

120
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,440
But I have to tell you

121
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,440
that if there are five players

122
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,360
then there will be five shares.

123
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,320
We will be out in the action.
What if one of us gets killed?

124
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,040
Then there will be four
players and four shares.

125
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,880
I agree. Tell me.

126
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,440
Great!

127
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,840
On the 26th, there is a
silver jubilee function of the Laxmi bank.

128
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,320
After the function,
Khanna will leave for abroad.

129
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,720
The night when he leaves

130
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,040
we will do our work on.

131
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,400
Where and how? I will tell
you when the correct time comes.

132
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,120
What are you thinking about?

133
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,400
I can't help but wonder,

134
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
if these three guys

135
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,520
can be trusted to keep their word.

136
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,880
Hey! Why are you afraid,
my darling?

137
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,080
I would not spare my own child

138
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,440
for so much money.

139
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,640
And these are just our associates.

140
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,960
And we are betrayers
by birth and caste.

141
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,640
Sir, whose house is this?

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
Lock the car and leave.

143
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Sir, what will I do after going home?

144
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,520
My wife is not at home.

145
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,240
I will do my duty.
I will earn some money.

146
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,480
There is no need.

147
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,160
Give me the keys.

148
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,440
Leave.

149
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,200
It is the bank's money.

150
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,920
If I had earned some
overtime what would he lose?

151
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,240
Let me see,
who does he come to meet?

152
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,640
-Sheela darling.
-Hello darling!

153
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,200
I am over here.

154
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,000
The inquiry has
started in the bank.

155
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,000
I am sick and tired of
answering their questions all day.

156
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,920
Relax, darling.
I will make your stress disappear.

157
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,720
Oh! So this is the matter.

158
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,320
Darling, I am making a drink.

159
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,520
-You come upstairs.
-I will come, dear.

160
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,480
Bring the drink over here only.
Give me a massage.

161
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,480
Now it will be real fun.

162
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,600
No! No!

163
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,280
No!

164
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,520
No! No!

165
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,720
No!

166
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,680
No!

167
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,920
No!

168
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,800
No!

169
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,040
No!

170
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,240
Laxmi bank musical competition.

171
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,760
The prize money is one lakh rupees.

172
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,960
The forms are available
from nine o'clock in the morning.

173
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,640
The closing date
is 20th November.

174
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,920
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Are you crazy?

175
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,960
Every struggling actor, singer
and dancer will be there.

176
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,600
We will not be
successful over there.

177
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,520
We will take at least two or
four days in the line to get the form.

178
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,960
And we will take another eight
to ten days to submit the form.

179
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,560
Yes. But why should
we bother about all this?

180
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,160
He will think about all this.

181
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,600
Our master, Ilu the Elvis.
Jai Kumar.

182
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,880
-Hey! Hurry up!
-Don't worry. Have patience.

183
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,560
Ilu, the meaning of standing
in the line and submitting the form

184
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,320
will take you Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday.

185
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,040
Which means that half
the week is already over.

186
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,920
After that, selections, rehearsals,

187
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,080
reviews, previews, competition.

188
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,200
In all, it is a matter
of many months, my dear.

189
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,560
Forget about one lakh rupees.

190
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,120
Don't worry, child.
Ilu means Elvis, the King.

191
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,160
Witness my power.
And my style.

192
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,680
What nonsense?
They are such imbeciles.

193
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,920
-What happened?
-What happened?

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,680
They told me that they
will give me the form

195
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,920
but they will take something
in return.

196
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,920
What will they take?

197
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,200
You rascal!
Don't you understand anything?

198
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,680
What people? We should throw
them all in the gutter.

199
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,680
What happened?

200
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,000
They are asking for ten thousand
rupees along with a form.

201
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,360
-Ten thousand!
-Such a large amount?

202
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
This is manipulation...

203
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,240
Do you mean
black money is in circulation?

204
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,120
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

205
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,760
Come on, let's run away from here.

206
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,120
-Come on, let's move from here.
-Come on. Come on.

207
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,160
Let's go. Let's go.

208
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,920
-Come on. Come on.
-Come on. Come on.

209
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,520
What happened?
Where are you all going?

210
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,360
-Why me?
-Get lost.

211
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,240
Why are you hitting me?

212
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,520
Did you see the miracle of Ilu,
the great?

213
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,320
Excuse me.
I want to submit the form.

214
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,000
-Sorry. Lunchtime.
-But it is only eleven o'clock now.

215
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,160
But these are the timings
that our bank follows.

216
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,600
Madam, there is only one form.
Please take it, please.

217
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,800
Okay.

218
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,360
-Yes!
-Has she taken it?

219
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,760
Where are your
ten thousand rupees?

220
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,160
-Ten thousand!
-Yes. Yes. Ten thousand rupees.

221
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Don't you have it?
Then come back tomorrow. Okay?

222
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Hey! But madam...

223
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,920
-Master Ilu, the miracle has failed.
-Ten thousand rupees in the bank!

224
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,280
Lunchtime!

225
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,000
Yes, who are you?

226
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,960
What's your problem?

227
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,000
Sir, a stupid man who looked
like a music director

228
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,400
was screaming for no reason.

229
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,760
He was saying,
"What do these people think?"

230
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,520
"That they can buy art with money?"

231
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,240
They will give 10,000 rupees
and earn lakhs of rupees.

232
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,000
I will not only teach him
a lesson, but also remind him

233
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,079
about his background.

234
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,240
Sir, first submit my form, please.

235
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,880
What is the matter? What happened?

236
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,280
Where are you all going?

237
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,200
What else, idiot? You have
closed the counter at eleven o'clock.

238
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,120
And on top of that,
you are committing fraud. Get lost!

239
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,600
This is false. This is wrong.

240
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,320
Believe me.

241
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
This is the enemy's plan to turn
our big-show into a flop-show.

242
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,240
Did you understand
anything, Bhalu?

243
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,200
There is somebody who
is smarter than us.

244
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,200
Sir. He...

245
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,520
-Come on, guys.
-Yes, let's go. Let's go.

246
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,200
Sir, that is the person who
was talking about buying art.

247
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,080
The person who has
disturbed our program.

248
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,320
Sir, please make him leave.
Please sir. Please.

249
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,240
Hey! Hey! Hey! What is this
entire nuisance, unnecessarily?

250
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,000
Tell me. Tell me.
Why don't you say something?

251
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,120
-Why don't you say?
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

252
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,640
Now submit my form
without any further ado,

253
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,080
Or else, for deceiving us and--

254
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,400
He is calling you
a fraud and a deceiver.

255
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,600
You say that I am a fraud?
I am a deceiver?

256
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Yes! And this girl
is also involved with you.

257
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,440
Hey! You imbecile!
Now I will teach you a lesson.

258
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,600
-Police!
-Who called out to us?

259
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,240
I keep on calling out
to you every day.

260
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,960
You never pay attention to me.

261
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,960
And you listen to everybody
who passes by on the roads.

262
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,880
Madam, we are not
husband and wife now.

263
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,160
Concentrate on your duty.

264
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
-Oh! Fine.
-Let's go.

265
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,120
Okay.

266
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,400
Brother. Sister-in-law.
I am a very cunning girl.

267
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,360
Now watch how I trap you
in your own plan and kill you.

268
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
What is the matter? What
is the matter? What is the matter?

269
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,360
This stupid goon is trying
to molest me. Manager sir.

270
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,520
He called me a fraud, unnecessarily.
He called me a cheat.

271
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,440
Then you must be
a fraud and a cheat.

272
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,920
Whatever he says is right.

273
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,920
Do you know who he is?

274
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,400
He is our inspector
Shankar Verma's brother.

275
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,680
Give me your form.
I shall fill it myself.

276
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,600
Take this.

277
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,080
Miss Cunning woman,
now I shall get into your house.

278
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,160
Bloody fool!

279
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Murli. Murli.

280
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,280
Hey Murli, where have you been?

281
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,240
It is time for Shankar
to come home.

282
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,040
-Quickly serve the food.
-Song?

283
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,080
If I knew how to sing a song

284
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,720
then wouldn't I have joined
the film industry?

285
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,440
You joke very well.

286
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,080
-Hello.
-Hello.

287
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,760
I am commissioner Rawat speaking.

288
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,160
-Greetings, brother!
-Greetings, sister!

289
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,320
I have called you up,
because right now,

290
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,480
your younger son Jai,
is in police custody.

291
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,600
-Jai! What are you saying?
-I am absolutely right.

292
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,480
-Your younger son has robbed.
-Robbed!

293
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
No. No. My Jai cannot do this.

294
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,880
-Oh my God!
-And it is not an ordinary theft.

295
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,120
He has robbed a jewelry store.

296
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,360
-He says that Jai has robbed a place.
-What?

297
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,480
-Just see.
-Hello.

298
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,680
Stealing, killing people. He
has not only betrayed the police.

299
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,120
-He has tried to fool them.
-What happened?

300
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
And I am afraid sister,
that I cannot

301
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,600
help you at all in this matter.

302
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,080
Nobody can do anything.
Your son Shankar--

303
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,680
Just a second.
Brother Shankar, actually...

304
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,080
I will not spare you today.

305
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
-You keep fooling around all the time.
-No! Mother, save me!

306
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
You cause trouble even
when you're not in jail.

307
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,320
We should really hit him
thoroughly. He is very naughty!

308
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
-He lies!
-Hit him! Hit him!

309
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,560
No. No. Brother, no.
It is enough! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

310
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,720
-Please forgive me.
-Let go of me. Let go of me.

311
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,080
Hey! What is this, brother?
You always reveal my secrets.

312
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,960
-Shut up!
-Child,

313
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,400
I have served food.
Come and have food.

314
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,760
Let's go eat.
Fooling around all the time.

315
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,040
I have brought the IPS form.
Fill it up.

316
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,440
And make the arrangements
for the examination.

317
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,640
This means that
I too should become

318
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,360
a government servant like you.

319
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,920
No brother.
If I become something,

320
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,920
then I will become a
millionaire or a billionaire.

321
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,080
Nowadays, there is no value of a
person who owns lakhs of rupees.

322
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,720
Is this the way to earn money?

323
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,280
If you help permit
someone's license

324
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,160
then you earn a commission.

325
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,200
You will clear out
somebody's house and

326
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,480
you will earn
money for a fortnight.

327
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,240
Hey! Have you ever thought
about whose son you are?

328
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,280
Whose grandson you are?

329
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,760
There is so much
respect for our family.

330
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,320
I love our family reputation

331
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,400
just as much as you do.

332
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,360
But this respect cannot help
us paint the walls of this house.

333
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,280
All these medals that you
have won, all of them together...

334
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
cannot repair the wrecked
ceiling of our house.

335
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,080
Just look into your
heart and try to remember...

336
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,280
that due to the
lack of money...

337
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,160
your love, your Shashi
left you and went away forever.

338
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,760
Shankar has done everything for this
household. For you. For that Shashi.

339
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,040
He wanted to make Shashi
the daughter-in-law of this house.

340
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,320
She broke my son's
heart and left.

341
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,000
And you...

342
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,480
Go and apologize to your brother.

343
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,760
Brother.

344
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,040
I am sorry.

345
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,720
Please forgive me.

346
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,880
If you find a person,
with a face similar to the faces

347
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,560
in these photographs
in any form, anywhere

348
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,000
then arrest them immediately.

349
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,080
Yes.

350
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,080
You don't worry, sir.

351
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,320
To get a hold of these people
is pretty simple for me.

352
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,800
It is pretty simple for her.

353
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,720
-May I come in, sir?
-Yes. Please come.

354
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,360
I am the chairman of Laxmi bank,
Jagdish Khanna.

355
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,880
Yes, sit down.
What can I do for you?

356
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,160
This is my driver
Roop Singh's wife.

357
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,040
Greetings!

358
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,080
Last Saturday,
after ten o'clock in the night

359
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,200
the driver did his
duty and went away.

360
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,080
He has been missing since then.
Can you please help us.

361
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,760
Take her statement and file a report.

362
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,520
-Yes. Please come.
-We will inform you...

363
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,240
as soon as we have any information.

364
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,760
Thank you. I will be obliged.

365
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,080
This poor woman has young kids.
She is very worried.

366
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,560
-We will do our best.
-Thank you.

367
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,720
Welcome friends!

368
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,520
I welcome you all to the first round
of Laxmi bank musical competition.

369
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,920
As you all know that among
the twenty-five semifinalists

370
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,280
two final teams
will be selected.

371
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,720
Which two teams will
enter the finals...

372
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,560
this decision will be
taken by our judge Mr. Mulchand

373
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,800
who himself is
a very famous singer.

374
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,200
Get aside, you fatty!
Come on, girls.

375
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,440
Master. Master, I have
seen her rehearsals.

376
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,560
She is truly creating magic.

377
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,280
I merely hope that she doesn't

378
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
blow up our fuse.

379
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,200
Before our fuse can
be switched off...

380
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,280
we will have to
short-circuit them.

381
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,080
Judge Mulchand!

382
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,760
-Come, sir. Come.
-Welcome, sir. Welcome!

383
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,200
-I am the manager over here and he...
-Thank you. Thank you.

384
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,040
Where is this hall?

385
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,240
Come sir, come.

386
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,200
-The hall is over there.
-Really?

387
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,160
-Please come.
-Is the hall over there?

388
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,760
Please come, sir. Please come.

389
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,680
Sir, actually in order
to participate in the finals

390
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,640
all the groups
are getting ready.

391
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,320
-Who is getting ready?
-The groups, sir.

392
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,760
-You take some rest until then.
-Hey! I keep on resting.

393
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,320
Along with that, there is an
 arrangement for eatables too.

394
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,200
Really!

395
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,880
Fried veggies. Sweets. Ice-creams.

396
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,280
And many other things.

397
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,240
So if I have to go somewhere
then where should I go?

398
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Over here.

399
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,640
Hey! What is this?

400
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,360
-Toilet!
-Open the door!

401
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,960
Come, Mr. Mulchand.

402
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,400
-Fried veggies!
-Cottage cheese rolls!

403
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,120
Sweets!

404
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,320
I am so hungry.

405
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,160
Come. Come.

406
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,080
Come on, let's go.

407
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,440
Stop it!

408
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,080
What are you doing, damsel!

409
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,520
Excellent face. Excellent figure.

410
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,720
-But...
-But? But what?

411
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,360
But it is impossible for you
to win the dance competition, my dear.

412
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,960
Why sir? Am I not dancing well?

413
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,440
You dance very well.
You dance very well.

414
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,160
But not of the MTV standard.

415
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,400
But don't worry, baby.
I will teach you.

416
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,160
You don't have to think.
You have to learn.

417
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,440
You don't have to
lose but you have to win.

418
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,200
And I will do it because
I have liked you.

419
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,120
Tomorrow you come to
my Hi-Fi dance classes.

420
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,000
Thank you, sir. I shall
never forget this favor all my life.

421
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,120
Not at all. Amazing!

422
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,000
Where are your classes, sir?

423
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,080
Fantasy open-air theatre.
4:00 in the evening.

424
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,600
One, two, three, four.

425
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,920
One, two, three, four.

426
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,960
One, two, three, four.

427
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,000
One, two, three, four.

428
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,680
-Stop! Mangesh, idiot!
-Sorry sir.

429
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,880
How many times have
I told you that nothing

430
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,000
-will happen
-Sorry sir. I made a mistake.

431
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
if you merely move
like a pendulum?

432
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,400
-Please forgive me.
-Get out, Mangesh.

433
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,360
-Greetings sir!
-Who are you?

434
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,080
Hey! How did you dare
to come to my classes

435
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,280
without my permission?

436
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,600
Hey! How did you dare to
greet me without my permission?

437
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,280
Sir, I was here for that
competition.

438
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,160
Competition?

439
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,480
-Yes.
-With me?

440
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,760
Hey! There is no competition
for me in this entire world.

441
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,440
-Get out!
-Boys, get back to work.

442
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,360
Sir, I had come to learn it, sir.

443
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,520
Sir, you told me that you would

444
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,880
teach me how to dance.

445
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,200
Oh! Amrapali!

446
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,720
Beautiful girl!

447
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,120
She will dance in the competition.

448
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,200
And she will win because
I will make her win.

449
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,560
You idiot!
Not like this. Do it properly.

450
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,520
Which dance forms do you know?

451
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,440
Sir, I know all types of dances.

452
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,400
Twist, Bhangra, Ramba-samba.

453
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,280
Bharatnatyam, Kuchipudi.

454
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,240
What about Bhel-puri?
Ragda-patties?

455
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,120
What, sir?

456
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,720
Forget it. Forget everything.
Just look at me.

457
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,000
Whatever I will do,
do that on the stage.

458
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,040
And you will win the first prize.
You will definitely win.

459
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,200

By the time we find these terrorists

00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,800
I would have lost all of my beauty.

501
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,920
Oh my God! It is so hot!

502
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,520
-What? Are you feeling hot?
-Yes.

503
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,080
By the time I explain this to you,

504
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,160
my intelligence, and my youth will
both fade away.

505
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,040
Madam, we are on duty.
We are on duty, madam.

506
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,320
-Forget about the duty.
-Everybody is looking at us.

507
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,240
-Everybody is looking at us, madam.
-And look at me, Santu.

508
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,240
Santu, my dear, look at me.

-Priest. Save me. Priest.

-Santu!

511
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,640
-Priest. Priest. Priest.
-May you progress, my child!

512
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,800
Kalyan, Karjat or Pune.
Anywhere will do.

513
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,600
I am sick of doing her duty.

514
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,880
Day and night have become one.

515
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,360
One night,
this Santram will be dead, priest.

516
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,400
Why are you pleading
in front of them?

517
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,640
You are my husband. Mine.

518
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,480
How will he save you?

519
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,400
A beard is the only difference I see

520
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
between these criminals
and these priests.

521
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,480
<i>Alakh Niranjan!</i>

522
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,320
Wow! You have kept
a very dashing name.

523
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,760
He is Alakh. You are Niranjan.

524
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,080
Then who is this third guy?
Amritanjan.

525
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,760
Insult! It is a very
big insult of the priests.

526
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,760
Hey madam!
They are priests not Santram

527
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,040
that you are insulting
them so much.

528
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,000
Shut up!

529
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,720
-What is below the beard?
-Hey!

530
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,240
What is below the shawl?

531
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,560
-Open up your beard.
-Insult. Grave insult!

532
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,240
I will teach you a lesson,
Amritanjan.

533
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,880
I will hit you all so badly

534
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,640
that I will teach you all
a good lesson. Santram, leave me!

535
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,840
You foolish woman!

536
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,880
Your body is of a human...

537
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,880
but your activities
are like an animal.

538
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,760
Hey! Shut up!

539
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,520
Here, this Bhutanand
priest curses you...

540
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,639
that you will become a dog.

541
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,360
You will become a dog.

542
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,280
<i>Alakh Niranjan! Alakh Niranjan! </i>
<i>Alakh Niranjan!</i>

543
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,000
<i>Alakh Niranjan!</i>

544
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,040
<i>Alakh Niranjan!</i>

545
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,880
Dear, you were turned into a dog?

546
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,639
What did you do, priest?

547
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,040
Priest! Priest! Priest! Priest!

548
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,920
Pushpi, how many times
have I told you

549
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,600
not to get
involved in unwanted fights!

550
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,960
Now what will happen to
you and what will happen to me?

551
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,200
What will we do?
How will we survive?

552
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,760
Priest!

553
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,200
O Lord! Which revenge
are you taking from me

554
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,040
by converting
my Pushpi into a dog?

555
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,520
Come on, get lost.

556
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,520
Now I have
to knead the dough.

557
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,360
I have to make the Rotis.

558
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,280
And I have to play the flute.

559
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,840
What should I do, Lord?
What should I do?

560
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,040
Come. Come over here. Sit down.

561
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,720
I don't even know whether
I should add

562
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,080
water in the flour or flour in the water?

563
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,600
Hey! What are you doing?

564
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,080
I just asked you.
Why are you getting angry?

565
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,440
Shouldn't I even
prepare the Roti now?

566
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,760
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

567
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,920
What are you doing?
Hey! Now will you knead the dough?

568
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,520
How will you roll them?
How will you roll them?

569
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,240
Give it to me.
How will you roll them?

570
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,880
Hey Pushpi! What are you doing?

571
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,760
Hey Pushpi! If you
knead the dough this way

572
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,280
then who will eat these Rotis?

573
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,560
Priest, make me a dog too.

574
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,280
The dog and the bitch
will together eat Rotis.

575
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,000
Enough! Enough!
Enough! Why are you barking?

576
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,520
I am sorry.

577
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,880
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

578
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,200
Shut up! You always
keep on getting bugged.

579
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,640
You keep on barking
for no reason at all.

580
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,160
You always get on my nerves.

581
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,720
-Shut up!
-Come here.

582
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,520
-What happened?
-Please, Pushpi!

583
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,960
If I eat this food
then do you know that

584
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,040
I will keep
puking for seven days?

585
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,040
I will die.

586
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,320
Come on, I will not speak to you.

587
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,640
You keep on barking for no reason at all.

588
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,760
-Hey Santram!
-Come. Please come.

589
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,400
Why are you talking to this dog like
a crazy person?

590
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,440
Hey! I am not mad. This is my wife.

591
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,560
Is this dog your wife?

592
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,280
Pushpa? Where is Pushpa?

593
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
Hey! I think that Pushpa
must have become fed up

594
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,360
of his craziness
and ran away somewhere.

595
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,880
No! Pushpa has not run away.
This is Pushpa.

596
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,840
He is lying.
He must have killed her for dowry.

597
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,440
Yes. Yes.
Take him to the police station.

598
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,280
-Take him to the police station.
-Take him to the police station.

599
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,560
-Take him.
-Take him.

600
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,800
Hey! That's not true.
Listen to me.

601
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,840
Listen to me.

602
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,280
Hey Pushpi! Explain to them.

603
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:20,160
No. No. No. Listen to me at least.

604
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,960
Pushpi, before they imprison
me for the crime of your death

605
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,080
we will have to
search for that priest.

606
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,920
Where will we find him?
Where? Priest.

607
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,640
Pushpi, come. Come.

608
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,040
Come and sit on my lap.

609
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,360
Come and sit on my lap.

610
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,680
You have given a very
good lesson of my love.

611
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,240
You have rubbed flour
on your lover's face.

612
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,120
Who will make the Roti's, Pushpi?

613
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,480
Are you trying to dress up a dog?

614
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
You will be suspended.
Then don't come to me.

615
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,800
-What is the problem?
-Nothing, sir.

616
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,080
I cannot tell you about
my problem even if I want to.

617
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,040
-Why?
-Take this.

618
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,000
You want a very long vacation.

619
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,520
And that too along
with your wife.

620
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,400
Do you intend to spend
another honeymoon with your wife?

621
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,400
Even if I had that intention

622
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,640
I would not be able
to act upon it.

623
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,120
The situation is very uncertain.

624
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,280
<i>These people have established</i>
<i>a new world record</i>

625
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,320
<i>by riding on the motorcycle.</i>

626
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,120
What is the matter?
Your dog is barking a lot.

Yes.

670
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,080
Raghuvansh Singh,
the partner of this club.

671
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,120
Oh! I am inspector Shankar Verma.

672
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,040
You're the reason I came here.

673
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,840
-Me?
-I need some information about star.

674
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,480
For a case I am working on.

675
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,000
-About this club of mine?
-No.

676
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,280
About the star formation.

677
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,680
A few days ago,
there was a motorcycle show

678
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,040
that took place...

679
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,520
You were the chief guest.

680
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,600
Yes. Yes.
Yes. Of course. Ask me. Come.

681
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,920
When you were in the army...

682
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,200
you used to do this show yourself,
didn't you?

683
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,440
Of course. I was the first man in India

684
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,160
to perform these stunts.

685
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,800
And you won medals for it.

686
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,720
At that time,
you had two associates with you.

687
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,800
Where are they presently?

688
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,280
Inspector sir, I don't know
how many shows I have performed.

689
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,240
How many associates I had...

690
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,480
I don't know who
might be where today?

691
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,280
Hey Sweety!
Come here. Now I have this club.

692
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,600
And there is only
enjoyment everywhere.

693
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,560
This is Sweety. The life of my club.

694
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
I will leave now.

695
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,840
Why are you in such a hurry,
inspector?

696
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,560
This was just an ordinary show.

697
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,280
If you wish then shall I
perform a personal show?

698
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,880
We do not prefer to
watch the personal shows

699
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,160
of cheap women like you,
who strip off and dance

700
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,440
to the sound of
clinging coins.

701
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,920
Only a woman can understand this.

702
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,680
Not a whore like you.

703
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,400
Poor fellow!

704
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,240
<i>How would I tell you</i>
<i>about all that I have been through?</i>

705
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,760
Here sister. Have some food.

706
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,360
The doctors say that if
your father is not operated upon...

707
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,640
-then your father...
-No, mother. No.

708
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,120
Nothing will happen to father.

709
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,680
I will eat it later.

710
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,000
Where are you going now?
To Shankar?

711
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,680
What will that poor guy do?

712
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,920
He has done so much
for us already.

713
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,040
And this is not a matter
of a thousand or two.

714
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:15,240
I know, mother. But I can
do anything for father's life.

715
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,960
What will you do?

716
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,200
You have already taken up all
the responsibility of this house.

717
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,280
You take tuitions
throughout the day.

718
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,480
You don't have time
to eat food or to go to sleep.

719
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,880
You have killed your
emotions and your desires,

720
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,080
you have ruined
your life for all of us.

721
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,040
Father, please. Have some rest.

722
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,200
I will arrange the money any way I can.

723
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,880
You will not do anything.
You will not do anything!

724
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,320
You will not do anything.

725
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,840
The person whose destiny
becomes his enemy,

726
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,160
nobody can do anything for him.

727
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,640
-Father!
-Nothing...

728
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,240
These doctors...
These doctors lie!

729
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,000
When they say an operation
can restore my health.

730
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,000
No. No.

731
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,640
Before dying,
I cannot pressurize you all...

732
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,920
with the burden of debt.

733
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,920
Stop talking!
You need rest.

734
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,120
Everything will be all right.

735
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,040
Everything will be all right.

736
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,520
Let go of the light of hope,
Shashi's mother.

737
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,440
-Wipe out this vermilion.
-No! No!

738
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,800
-Father!
-Break these bangles.

739
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,960
-No.
-Father!

740
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,840
Your hope will live on as long as
you wear them.

741
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,560
-Break them. Break them.
-No. No.

742
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,520
-What are you saying?
-Papa, please.

743
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,120
What is wrong with you?

744
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,160
Father! Father!

745
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,080
Hey Sweety!
How are you?

746
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,880
Sir, the money that you
had promised me, please give it.

747
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,320
-Please sir. Sir, I have to go home.
-Yes.

748
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,840
Take this. Pick it up.

749
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,760
Hey girl!

750
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,640
Dance!

751
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,480
What?

752
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,200
Come on. Dance.

753
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,440
-Come on, Sweety. Dance.
-Sir, please.

754
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,600
-Sir I have to go home.
-Dance.

755
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,200
-Sir, my mother is waiting for me.
-Come on, dance.

756
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,960
-Sir, please.
-One. Two. Three. Four.

757
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,600
-Sir, please. Please.
-Dance. I am very rarely in a good mood.

758
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,080
Dance. Dance. Dance.

759
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,360
-Hey! Come on, dance with me.
-No.

760
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,720
-Let's dance together.
-No.

761
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,840
Come on, let's dance together.

762
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,280
-Come on. Dance.
-No. No.

763
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,200
-Let go of me. Let go of me.
-Dance with me. Come on.

764
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,680
Yeah! Dance with me.
Dance with me. Yeah! Come on.

765
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,680
Come on, dance with me.
Come on, dance with me.

766
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,480
When I say dance, you dance.
Okay? Okay?

767
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,600
Nobody says no to Raghuvansh.

768
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,040
-Nobody says no to Raghuvansh.
-No. No.

769
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,040
Let go of me. Please.

770
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,760
I am begging you.

771
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,080
-Shut up and dance!
-Sir, please let me go.

772
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,600
-Help me!
-Let's dance. Dance with me.

773
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,040
Hey! Hey!

774
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,720
Please. I am begging you.

775
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,600
Let go of me. No.

776
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,640
Help me!

777
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,920
Help me!

778
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,960
-Have you come home, daughter?
-Yes mother.

779
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,000
What is the matter?
You are very late today.

780
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,200
I have brought the money, mother.

781
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,640
I have brought the money.

782
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,200
This is very good.
Now everything will be all right.

783
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,040
Yes mother. Now everything
will be all right.

784
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,720
Everything.

785
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,840
The meaning is very clear.

786
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,720
Naresh's uncle lives in America.

787
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,560
And after their marriage,
I am thinking about

788
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,200
getting both of them
settled there.

789
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,000
What do you say, child?

790
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,240
But it is very important
to arrange money to pay

791
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,040
the expenses of going
to America. Isn't it, brother?

792
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,000
Look brother, I don't
have much but...

793
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,640
We can arrange for twenty
of twenty-five thousand rupees.

794
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,120
We will.

795
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,360
You are being naive, sister.

796
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,440
You don't even get the
tickets to go to America

797
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,480
in twenty or twenty-five thousand rupees.

798
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,720
I think the entire expense
will be of rupees two lakhs.

799
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,160
Right, child?

800
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,400
You bring the procession.

801
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,240
You will get the money
before the nuptial rounds.

802
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,480
You will get the money?

803
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,840
By doing the road shows.
By doing cabaret.

804
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,920
I am tired of my middle
class life. Even I want money.

805
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,800
I want a good house.
I want good clothes.

806
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,520
So you will make a joke
out of yourself for that.

807
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,920
You will expose your body.

808
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,800
If I had become your wife

809
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,520
then what would I get by
doing the household chores?

810
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,680
The same amount of two
or four thousand rupees.

811
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,240
If I dance in the club
then I will get it every night.

812
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,880
Ten thousand.
Twenty-five thousand.

813
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,960
I spit on the woman...

814
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,800
who sees no difference between
a husband and a wife

815
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,760
and the business of
exposing yourself for money.

816
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,120
Shankar.

817
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,440
Shashi, why did Shankar leave?

818
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,720
What did you tell him?

819
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,040
For my needs,
Shankar would have sold

820
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,920
his sincerity and
his honesty, mother.

821
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,320
And I would have never
been able to bear it.

822
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,200
<i>And anyway, your daughter</i>
<i>who has been ruined</i>

823
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,160
<i>due to her circumstances,</i>

824
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,440
<i>I don't have anything</i>
<i>to give to him. Nothing.</i>

825
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,560
-Hello.
-Hello. It's me, child.

826
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,960
-Yes mother.
-The preparations for

827
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,280
Tina's wedding are complete.

828
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,560
Really?

829
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,160
Really, mother.
This is good news.

830
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,480
But my child, the money...

831
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,160
Don't worry about the money.

832
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,600
I am right here.

833
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,600
All the arrangements will be done.

834
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,840
You just make the
arrangements for the wedding.

835
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,200
Everything will be all right.

836
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:51,920
Everything.

837
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,640
And then the people who play
with cruelty like a game...

838
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,120
will be brought to death's door
by your daughter.

839
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,080
I found it!

840
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,720
I have found the miraculous
priest's hermitage.

841
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,960
Priest. Priest. Priest.

842
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,960
-Who is it?
-Have mercy on me, Lord.

843
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,600
Have mercy on this poor man.

844
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,800
Where should I go, Lord?
Where should I go?

845
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,040
Why are you pleading, child?

846
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,560
I don't want to plead
but I want to meet, priest.

847
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,040
Take the curse back, priest.

848
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,280
We are husband and wife.

849
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,360
What awkward position
have you put us into?

850
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,800
She is an animal.
I am a human being.

851
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,040
How do we meet halfway, priest?

852
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,960
The curse that I have given,
it can never be taken back, child.

853
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,240
Why can't it be taken back, priest?

854
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,920
Is it a sold good that
it cannot be taken back?

855
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,960
Goods once sold
will not be returned.

856
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,120
No priest. You are the creator.

857
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,840
You are the only
superstar priest in this world.

858
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,880
Lord, please do something.

859
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,640
Please do something, Lord. Priest!

860
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,800
Please do something.

861
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,320
Otherwise I will die without
being dead, my lord.

862
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,080
The curse that I had given,
I cannot take it back.

863
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,440
But, I can reduce its effect.

864
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,800
She will have to meditate
Lord Brahma's prayers

865
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,120
for 40 Mondays.

866
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,800
If I am impressed
then I will release her.

867
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,520
<i>-Alakh Niranjan.</i>
<i>-Alakh Niranjan.</i>

868
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,680
-Pushpa! Pushpa!
-Santu!

869
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,960
-40 Mondays.
-Yes. 40 Mondays.

870
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,040
Pushpa...

871
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,560
-we have played many one-day matches.
-Yes.

872
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,520
Now we will play
the Monday matches too.

873
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,080
Monday ticket.
Monday ticket. Monday...

874
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,600
Tonight,
Khanna will attend the function.

875
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,640
And we will kidnap
him from the function.

876
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,520
I am not highly educated
but I know at least this much,

877
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,720
that you are a fool.

878
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,280
Hey! What do you mean?

879
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,600
Have patience!

880
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,880
After the function, and
before boarding the flight...

881
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,680
Khanna will definitely come
to meet Sheela darling.

882
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,080
Alone.

883
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,000
Good. Very good.

884
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,880
But I have one condition.

885
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,600
That none of you
will kill the chairman.

886
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,400
You will have to
bring him to me. Alive.

887
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,960
I will kill him.

888
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,040
This... Forget humans, even the Gods

889
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,960
will be unable to
understand this trick.

890
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,920
-Will you kill the chairman?
-Yes.

891
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,160
But you have roamed around
here and there with him.

892
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,200
That is not the matter,
Raghu darling.

893
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,480
Becoming intimate with the
chairman was a part of my plan.

894
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,200
It was my helplessness.

895
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,680
And I have done all
that for your sake.

896
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,320
Don't you know that I
hate that chairman so much?

897
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,520
What? Hey!
What are you saying, darling?

898
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,600
Yes. That chairman is a bastard.

899
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,960
He tried to... He tried to...

900
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,960
What did he try to do with you?

901
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,640
No. Forget it. You will tense up.

902
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,640
Hey! I am asking you
what he did to you. Tell me.

903
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,280
He tried to... He tried to
molest me. He tried to rape me.

904
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,280
Look at this.

905
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,760
Hey! Hey! Hey!
How dare that bastard!

906
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,640
I will...

907
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,680
It was a good thing
that the waiter came in.

908
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,520
Otherwise...
I will kill him.

909
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,880
No. No. No. My darling, no.

910
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,200
Just listen to me.

911
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:36,080
To fire a bullet and to
use a weapon is a man's job.

912
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,600
I am not highly educated but
I definitely know...

913
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:47,080
how to put this bullet into
that chairman's chest?

914
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,960
Darling, you are not a man.
You are a lion. A lion.

915
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:56,040
-You are a lion. Naughty boy.
-My darling! My darling!

916
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,800
I welcome you all
to the silver jubilee

917
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,920
dance competition of Laxmi bank.

918
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,200
I now hand it over to Mr. Mulchand.

919
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,880
Who will win the
prize of 1 lakh rupees?

920
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,200
Come, I shall introduce
you all to both our finalists.

921
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,760
Mr. Jai Verma.

922
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,120
Come, Mr. Verma. Welcome!

923
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,560
Miss Neeru! Give her a big hand.

924
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,080
So Mr. Verma, what do you think?
Will you win this prize?

925
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,240
Yes. Definitely.

926
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,920
But how can you say that?

927
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,600
That is because
I am the best dancer.

928
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,840
Wow! Wow! Wow! What confidence!

929
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:47,200
Miss Neeru, what do you think?
Will you win this competition?

930
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,840
-Yes.
-Why?

931
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,200
Because I have my
Guru's blessings with me.

932
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,280
May the best person win!

933
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,920
Let this competition start!

Thank you. Thank you very much.

Thank you.

997
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,120
Thank you very much, sir.

998
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,320
Thank you.

999
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,600
Congratulations! Well done, my boy!

1000
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,760
Thank you, sir.

1001
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,280
I apologize.

1002
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,320
In spite of trying very hard,
I couldn't win this prize.

1003
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,760
You are not to blame my child.

1004
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,480
It is destiny that is against me.

1005
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:14,120
I had thought that,
with this money...

1006
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,640
that son of mine
would get a new life

1007
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,600
the one fighting against
death in the hospital.

1008
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,160
But now I have one wish.

1009
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,120
That I die, before my son does.

1010
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,520
Nothing was lacking in your efforts.
Nothing was lacking.

1011
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,600
Uncle, wait a minute.

1012
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:49,000
I never thought that
you would be such a great person.

1013
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,080
Not just this competition,
I cannot win

1014
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,840
any competition
against you in life.

1015
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,560
Take this, Neeru.
You give this check to him.

1016
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:02,080
Take this, uncle.
Get your child operated.

1017
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,600
Thank you. Thank you, son.

1018
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,840
But uncle, we will have
to change the name on this check.

1019
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,680
-Come on, let us go to Mr. Khanna.
-Come on.

1020
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,840
Excuse me. Excuse me. Side please.
Excuse me.

1021
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,000
Okay, my friend.
I will come back from London.

1022
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,000
Then we shall meet.

1023
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,000
I am not highly educated,
but I know this much...

1024
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,560
that there is nothing
more important than a friend.

1025
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,520
Take care of yourself, my friend.

1026
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,640
I shall meet you very soon.

1027
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,840
Fine.

1028
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:38,280
Mr. Khanna. Wait, Mr. Khanna.

1029
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,000
Come on, we shall follow him.
Give the keys of the bike.

1030
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,480
-Okay. Come on.
-I will drop this at your house.

1031
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,360
Where did he go, Neeru?

1032
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,480
Don't move.

1033
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,600
It is strange.
We were right behind him.

1034
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,680
-And now...
-Jai! Look over there.

1035
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,800
They are taking the chairman.

1036
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,040
Oh my God!

1037
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,880
Loot. Police.

1038
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,040
Neeru, there must be
a phone nearby.

1039
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:39,920
You go call the police.

1040
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,240
-I will go inside.
-But Jai...

1041
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:43,040
This is not the time to argue.
Neeru, go.

1042
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,200
What are you doing?

1043
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,880
No!

1044
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Come on.

1045
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,800
Let's go.

1046
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,920
Open the locker.

1047
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,439
-This is the public's money!
-This is ours.

1048
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,640
The law...
The law will not spare you.

1049
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:51,040
Open the locker, chairman
otherwise I will kill you. Come on.

1050
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,320
I will open it. I will open it.

1051
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,680
"The veil has been stained"

1052
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,080
Brother,
is there a phone around?

1053
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,960
-There is no phone here.
-Oh no!

1054
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,240
Come on. Hurry up.

1055
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,200
Hello. Nehru Nagar police station.

1056
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,720
Inspector Shankar.
I am his brother Jai speaking.

1057
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,400
-Come on. Come on.
-Who is he?

1058
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,480
He is inspector
Shankar's brother...

1059
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,000
The one who has made our
survival difficult.

1060
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,800
-Today I will kill this bastard.
-Stop!

1061
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,720
We have another way of
getting revenge on his brother.

1062
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,000
We will be the ones looting...

1063
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,440
But the camera will
click pictures of him.

1064
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,080
Hey, Blacky! What do you think?

1065
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,600
You say the word and I will do it?

1066
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,880
Hey fool! Not just you,
even your saviors will do it.

1067
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,160
Fill up the boxes...

1068
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,720
or we will kill the chairman.

1069
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,880
No. No. Save me.
Save me. Son, save me.

1070
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,520
Come on.

1071
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,160
Listen to me,
is there a telephone over here?

1072
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,160
-What?
-The bank is being looted.

1073
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,400
Brother. Brother.

1074
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,280
Hello. Hello police station.

1075
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:39,160
Hey! No station. You are amazing!
You are so pretty!

1076
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,480
Help!

1077
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,720
-Come on, Neeru. Let's go.
-What happened, Jai?

1078
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,120
Come on.

1079
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:07,360
Come on.
Ragunath, this is your prey.

1080
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,920
Where is your partner?

1081
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,480
Call her and kill him.

1082
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:17,920
Women don't do such things.
Men do it. Men do it.

1083
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,560
Oh! So you have done all this.

1084
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,920
You are the worst friend.

1085
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,840
You are not a friend
but a betrayer.

1086
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,520
Really? And you are a
very good friend, aren't you?

1087
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:40,520
You bastard!
You tried to molest my Sheela?

1088
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,000
You tried to rape her? I am going to...

1089
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:49,560
You became Sheela's lover?

1090
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,080
Take this.
This is Sheela's revolver.

1091
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,600
And the bullets are also hers.

1092
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,840
Embrace her.

1093
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,480
Jai! Chairman!

1094
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,720
Come on.

1095
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,800
Welcome!
Welcome! Welcome, my brave men!

1096
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,800
Lata, until all this wealth
is not allocated properly

1097
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,560
it will remain in this
container in my cold storage.

1098
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,680
Yes! That is correct.

1099
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,320
Yes. But, listen to me.

1100
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:15,160
For the sake of the
security of this safe

1101
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,560
along with your men,
and these dead animals

1102
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,880
even my men will
be present here.

1103
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:26,040
And you will have one key of
this safe while I have the other.

1104
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,720
When both the keys
are put into it...

1105
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,640
only then will this
safe open.

1106
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,240
Why? Do you agree?

1107
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:33,720
I agree.

1108
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:40,360
Hey dear! Hey brother!
Just show me once...

1109
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,360
what five to
seven crores look like?

1110
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,120
Come on, I shall show you.

1111
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,280
Yeah!

1112
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,880
Sir, Mr. Khanna did
not boarded the flight.

1113
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,600
This means that Mr. Khanna
has been trapped by those criminals.

1114
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,960
Sir, the projector is ready.

1115
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,040
Sir, let's see the pictures
taken by the secret camera.

1116
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,560
Yes, come on.

1117
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,400
This is not possible.

1118
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,600
Do you know him, Shankar?

1119
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,680
He... he is my younger brother.

1120
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,880
From the film it seems as though

1121
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,120
your brother was
involved in the robbery.

1122
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,280
It's impossible, sir.

1123
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,920
I understand your sentiments,
but what is the truth?

1124
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:17,040
You have to inquire whether your brother
was involved in this robbery or not.

1125
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:21,720
And I know, Mr. Shankar,
you will fulfill your responsibility

1126
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,600
with complete honesty.

1127
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,440
Mr. Gokhale...

1128
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:33,320
issue an arrest warrant
in the name of Jai Verma.

1129
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,760
And arrest him wherever you see him.

1130
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:37,680
Yes sir.

1131
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,760
Here. Drink water.

1132
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,080
-I'll get some more.
-Let it be.

1133
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,560
We should leave this place.

1134
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,480
We should tell the police everything
so that they can

1135
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,080
inquire the
death of the chairman

1136
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,480
and arrest those robbers.

1137
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,280
That's true.

1138
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,640
Come. Let's go. But can you walk?

1139
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,240
I am sorry!
I am sorry! Are you hurt?

1140
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,840
What is this sorry?
Can't you say that you're hurt?

1141
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,120
You broke my head.

1142
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,720
Why are you yelling at me?

1143
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,800
First you got me wrapped
up in a robbery,

1144
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,200
then you broke my leg,

1145
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,000
and now you've brought me here,
in the middle of a jungle

1146
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,840
in this palace of ghosts.

1147
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,800
God knows what sort of dangerous

1148
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,480
animals live in this jungle.

1149
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,120
What else could I do?

1150
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,600
Stop following the thieves?

1151
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,840
Ok, now stop crying.
We are far away from the city...

1152
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,600
in the middle of this dark jungle.

1153
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,280
It was pointless to walk
in this state.

1154
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,600
And by the way, there are no
dangerous animals in this jungle.

1155
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,840
They are here.

1156
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,520
Look at your dangerous animals.

1157
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,040
How stupid.

1158
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,520
Very stupid.

1159
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,160
-Do you smoke?
-What?

1160
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,440
No, I don't.

1161
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,080
Do you smoke?

1162
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,800
No, you idiot.
If you were a smoker

1163
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,440
you would have a matchbox,

1164
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,560
and if you had a matchbox,
we could have lit a fire.

1165
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,040
And the cold would disappear.

1166
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,240
That's true. Come. Get up.

1167
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,440
Look, cold kills cold.

1168
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,240
You have a bath with that
cold water, I'll light a fire.

1169
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,440
How?

1170
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,160
Watching you bathe...

1171
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,400
will make me so hot...

1172
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,640
By rubbing two stones together.

1173
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,760
I learnt it when
I was in scouts.

1174
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,560
Stone, stone, stone.

1175
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:36,480
<i>"My sweetheart is in front of me"</i>

1176
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:41,360
<i>"My sweetheart is in front of me"</i>

1177
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:46,040
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1178
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:53,680
<i>"My sweetheart is in front of me"</i>

1179
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:58,440
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1180
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:03,720
<i>"I want to watch her</i>
<i>To my heart's content"</i>

1181
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,160
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1182
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:13,520
<i>"My sweetheart is in front of me"</i>

1183
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:18,160
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1184
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:25,760
<i>"My sweetheart is in front of me"</i>

1185
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,680
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1186
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,800
<i>"I want to watch him</i>
<i>To my heart's content"</i>

1187
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:40,640
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1188
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:45,640
<i>"My sweetheart is in front of me"</i>

1189
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:50,560
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1190
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:13,000
<i>"Why did you hide in the clouds"</i>

1191
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:17,880
<i>"Right when my darling</i>
<i>Was in front of me?"</i>

1192
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:22,920
<i>"Why did you hide in the clouds"</i>

1193
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:28,480
<i>"Right when my darling</i>
<i>Was in front of me?"</i>

1194
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,640
<i>"Why did he hide in the clouds"</i>

1195
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:47,680
<i>"Right when your darling</i>
<i>Was in front of you?"</i>

1196
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,800
<i>"If it's so necessary to hide, then come"</i>

1197
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:57,560
<i>I'll hide you in my veil"</i>

1198
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,920
<i>"In my veil"</i>

1199
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,520
<i>"In my veil"</i>

1200
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:12,320
<i>"Even when you hide in my veil"</i>

1201
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:17,200
<i>"Even when you hide in my veil"</i>

1202
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:21,880
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1203
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:29,680
<i>"I want to watch her</i>
<i>To my heart's content"</i>

1204
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:34,280
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1205
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:39,440
<i>"My sweetheart is in front of me"</i>

1206
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,560
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1207
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:14,000
<i>"Then he took me in</i>
<i>His arms in front of you"</i>

1208
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:19,720
<i>"Then he took me in</i>
<i>His arms in front of you"</i>

1209
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:33,640
<i>"Then he took me in</i>
<i>His arms in front of you"</i>

1210
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:38,240
<i>"Then he took me in</i>
<i>His arms in front of you"</i>

1211
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,880
<i>"I found the company of my love"</i>

1212
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:47,840
<i>"On the lonely roads of life"</i>

1213
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,440
<i>"On these lonely roads"</i>

1214
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,120
<i>"On these lonely roads"</i>

1215
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:03,200
<i>"Now the journey of</i>
<i>Life has become easier"</i>

1216
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:07,800
<i>"Now the journey of</i>
<i>Life has become easier"</i>

1217
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:12,360
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1218
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:20,240
<i>"I want to watch him</i>
<i>To my heart's content"</i>

1219
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:25,000
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1220
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:30,000
<i>"My sweetheart is in front of me"</i>

1221
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:34,920
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1222
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,880
<i>"My sweetheart is in front of me"</i>

1223
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,000
<i>"Oh moon, keep shining"</i>

1224
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,120
Let your law think
whatever it wants.

1225
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,480
But I know that my son is innocent.

1226
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:05,280
Even if your heart is not the best
witness, then my heart too...

1227
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,800
does not consider Jai a criminal.

1228
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:12,120
But he has made things
difficult by running from the law.

1229
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,280
He is childish,
he has yet to see this world.

1230
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:16,960
Rescue him from this problem.

1231
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,400
Promise me, that you won't
let anything happen to him...

1232
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,880
That you'll bring him back home.

1233
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,440
Tell me, dear. Tell me.

1234
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,760
Why are you quiet? Tell me!

1235
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,320
You have to swear on my love for you.

1236
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,120
Mom, if your blessings
are with me...

1237
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:37,400
then Shankar will
never fail to do his duty.

1238
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,560
He will never fail.

1239
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,960
Commissioner, if we don't
get the party's money

1240
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,560
then the high command will fire me

1241
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,600
-and I'll hang you upside down.
-Yes sir.

1242
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,560
Wow! This seems like a
very romantic place to me.

1243
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:54,840
This waterfall,
my thirsty young body.

1244
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,200
Come, my...

1245
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,000
You're scared for no reason.
It was just a pigeon.

1246
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:08,480
"These pigeons fell
On my face from the top"

1247
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,400
She is giving me shocks.

1248
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:17,000
-Madam... Look... Look...
-Look at what?

1249
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,680
It has been so long since you
have shown me anything.

1250
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,120
My body is burning.

1251
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,920
Fire, water, smoke, where?

1252
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,200
"My heart started beating"

1253
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,840
"My body started burning"

1254
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,600
"Darling, leave my wrist"

1255
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,040
"Don't pluck the flowers
which have not yet bloomed"

1256
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,200
Madam! Madam! Madam!

1257
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,120
You forgot the curse
given by Alakh Niranjan.

1258
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,520
You forgot the curse!
You forgot the curse!

1259
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,920
The curse!

1260
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,040
You became a bitch again?

1261
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,600
You became a bitch.
Are you happy now?

1262
01:27:58,360 --> 01:27:59,960
"My heart started beating"

1263
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,640
Now keep on barking.

1264
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,840
How many times have I told you, madam
that do your duty, do your duty?

1265
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,960
Why are you barking?
Tell me at least?

1266
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,600
Madam! Madam! Listen to me, madam!

1267
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,400
Jai's handkerchief!

1268
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,440
So that means we are
heading in the right direction.

1269
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,600
Madam, keep your nose to the ground...

1270
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,240
smell them, and take me to them.

1271
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,920
Please madam.
Shall we go? We should?

1272
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,080
One moment madam, I am coming too.

1273
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,480
Wait, go slow, go slow. Madam!

1274
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,640
I can't find the spot where criminals

1275
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,760
threw the body of
the chairman after killing him.

1276
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,520
The whole jungle seems
to be one and the same.

1277
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:54,800
There must be
dangerous animals here.

1278
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,880
What if an animal ate him?

1279
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,240
Come on!

1280
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,680
Where are you taking me?

1281
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,400
You have become a bitch,
but I am a man.

1282
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:04,440
How much longer can I run?

1283
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:07,000
If you run like that,

1284
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:10,400
then I won't
even be able to walk.

1285
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,520
Bitch, we have to
increase our love slowly,

1286
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,520
we have to cross the limits.

1287
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,560
Bitch, where else
do we have to go?

1288
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,640
There must be snakes
and scorpions there.

1289
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:23,640
Brother, please save me!
Brother, please save me!

1290
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,440
Brother,
please save me from this bitch.

1291
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,440
Neeru, she is not a bitch,
she is your sister-in-law.

1292
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,600
-What?
-She is Pushpa.

1293
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,920
-What?
-What?

1294
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,240
This is so strange!

1295
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,720
Does this mean that the
curse will never disappear?

1296
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:45,800
It will, if I feed 40 priests.
I have to serve them

1297
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:50,120
and make them
meet the head of the priests.

1298
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,520
Then she'll become a human being.

1299
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,440
-Yes.
-Well, let it be.

1300
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,760
The police think that
you are the criminal, Jai.

1301
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,440
But you know the truth, brother.

1302
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,280
But who'll believe the truth?

1303
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,720
My brother,
my brother will believe me.

1304
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,200
He won't believe you.

1305
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:08,960
He is a police officer.
He only believes evidence.

1306
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,440
Then we'll search
for the evidence.

1307
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,320
The criminals were
hidden here somewhere.

1308
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,360
And they had even
murdered chairman Khanna.

1309
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,840
-They murdered him?
-Yes.

1310
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,600
But we didn't find any criminal,
neither any dead body.

1311
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:21,160
Pushpi, did we see any dead body?

1312
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,840
I think there is something here.
Come with me.

1313
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:31,800
Run slowly, slowly.
She really tires me out, I swear.

1314
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:33,080
Pushpi!

1315
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,560
Where are you going?
Is there a dead body?

1316
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:47,840
Is there a letter in your mouth?

1317
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,520
Don't eat it.
Don't eat it. Throw it. Throw it.

1318
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,920
Matchbox.

1319
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,360
Be careful, it might be a bomb.
You'll burst into pieces.

1320
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,560
Star club.

1321
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,920
Five weeks have passed since
her husband disappeared

1322
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,560
and we can't even
find his dead body.

1323
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,040
And five days have passed
since the chairman disappeared

1324
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:12,600
and we can't even find his dead body.

1325
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,440
Five crores are missing
from the bank

1326
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,520
and the dead body is not yet found.

1327
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,560
And this phone has been ringing
for the past five minutes.

1328
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,080
Should I kill you both?

1329
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,840
Hello, Nehru Nagar police station.

1330
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,720
-Is this Shankar sir?
-Yes.

1331
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:25,760
<i>There is important</i>
<i>information for you.</i>

1332
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,600
<i>Some international smugglers</i>
<i>are going to gather tonight at Star club.</i>

1333
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,640
<i>And you will have to</i>
<i>witness the occasion for yourself.</i>

1334
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,480
Who is speaking?

1335
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,680
<i>Come and recognize me.</i>

1336
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,800
<i>"My darling has come"</i>

1337
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,200

<i>"The message for which I was waiting"</i>

1341
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:23,680

1342
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,120
<i>"The message for which I was waiting"</i>

1343
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:31,320

1344
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,960
<i>"Your name has entered"</i>

1345

<i>"Into my heartbeats"</i>

1346
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,440
<i>"The message for which I was waiting"</i>

1347
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:46,640
<i>"That message has arrived"</i>

1348
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,880
<i>"Don't mind"</i>

1349
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:18,400
<i>"If I love you"</i>

1350
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:26,480
<i>"Don't mind"</i>

1351
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:30,200
<i>"Don't mind"</i>

1352
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:33,720
<i>"If I love you"</i>

1353
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,640
<i>"Don't mind"</i>

1354
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,160
<i>"If I love you"</i>

1355
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,400
<i>"That time has come"</i>

1356
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:49,400
<i>"When the heart does not</i>

1357
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,800

<i>"To bring you to me on its own"</i>

1363
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,680
<i>"You would come</i>
<i>To me on your own"</i>

1364
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,200
<i>"My destiny was against me"</i>

1365
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,560
<i>"To bring you to me on its own"</i>

1366
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:51,880
<i>"My destiny was against me"</i>

1367
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:55,720
<i>"To bring you to me on its own"</i>

1368
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,560
<i>"The secret which was hidden"</i>

1369
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:03,480
<i>"In my heart, has been revealed"</i>

1370
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,080
<i>"Your name has entered"</i>

1371
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:11,120
<i>"My heartbeats"</i>

1372
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,800
<i>"The message for which I was waiting"</i>

1373
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,520
<i>"That message has arrived"</i>

1374
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,200
<i>"Your name has entered"</i>

1375
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:25,880
<i>"My heart beats"</i>

1376
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,440
He has murdered him! He is dead!

1377
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,560
Someone please catch him! Don't
let this bastard go! Catch him!

1378
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,280
Brother, I am innocent.
I haven't done this murder.

1379
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,360
Shut up!

1380
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,680
You are under arrest.

1381
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,720
No one will leave until
everyone's statement is taken.

1382
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,040
Mr. Singh,
call up the police station.

1383
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,720
Inspector,
this man was my brother.

1384
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,880
Your brother has
murdered my brother.

1385
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,600
I am going to kill him.

1386
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,840
Don't try to take on the law.

1387
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,120
Only the court can punish him.

1388
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:05,160
What? Even you think
that I am a criminal?

1389
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,280
I'll save you if you're innocent.

1390
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,240
I am not very educated,
but I know that

1391
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:15,840
we are all
witnesses to this murder.

1392
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,600
We'll see to it that you won't
be able to save your brother.

1393
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,640
Don't move!

1394
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,880
You will save me, brother?

1395
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,400
Everybody has already
branded me as a criminal.

1396
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,680
I can't take the blame of
someone else's murder on myself.

1397
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,600
Stop, Jai,
otherwise I'll shoot you.

1398
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,720
Then you'll kill
two innocent people.

1399
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,480
Not me, but someone
else is the murderer.

1400
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,000
Jai! Jai stop! Stop, Jai!

1401
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,680
Jai!

1402
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,800
Stop, Jai! Stop!

1403
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,280
Shame on us! Shame on us!

1404
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:28,840
That young boy shot our
Biswas in front of everyone.

1405
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:34,400
And us idiots were just
staring at each other's faces.

1406
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:37,440
My question is, why didn't you

1407
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,040
kill that guy
in the bank itself?

1408
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,120
Why are we arguing
over what didn't happen?

1409
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,200
We should think about
what we have to do next.

1410
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,560
I was thinking the same thing.

1411
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:51,560
What did that guy get
by killing Biswas?

1412
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:55,400
I was there,
even commander was there.

1413
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,440
What do you say minister?

1414
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,760
Don't tell me, you thought four people,
four shares.

1415
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,040
What are you trying to say?

1416
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,080
I am not so educated,
but I know that

1417
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:12,320
if my share has increased,
even your share has increased.

1418
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,080
Even you might be the murderer.

1419
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:17,160
-Minister! Mind your tongue!
-You have started arguing again.

1420
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,560
There were so many people there

1421
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,440
I was there,
and even that dancer girl.

1422
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:21,440
Shashi!

1423
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:26,480
General, is it possible that

1424
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:28,240
Shashi is trying to take revenge?

1425
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,280
Revenge!

1426
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:31,040
Revenge for what?

1427
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,080
Nothing...

1428
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:36,680
Commander,
the buyers have run away.

1429
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,680
Even the police doubt us.

1430
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:44,840
Ok, I'll arrange my ship,
and we'll send the things abroad.

1431
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:48,160
And, give the order
to our men

1432
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:50,720
to shoot that guy on sight.

1433
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,040
Kill the bastard!

1434
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,600
Who is it at this time?

1435
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,520
Shankar? Police?

1436
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:24,880
Right now, I am on duty,

1437
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,440
and I've come here
as a police inspector.

1438
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:31,800
-Search the house.
-Search the house? But why?

1439
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:35,400
A man called Biswas has
been murdered in the club.

1440
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:37,760
His body was in Jai's hands.

1441
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:42,000
I tried to stop him, but he still escaped.
What does this prove, mom?

1442
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,280
You tell me.

1443
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:47,080
You mean... Jai is a murderer?

1444
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:50,160
No, no,
my Jai cannot be a murderer!

1445
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,520
Come on.

1446
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:11,960
There is no one here, sir.

1447
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:16,680
Ok, send a message
to not let Jai escape.

1448
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:17,880
Yes sir.

1449
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:34,120
I know that you feel very bad.

1450
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,400
But do you know...

1451
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,000
what your son put me through today?

1452
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:45,040
I had to shoot Jai as part of my duty.

1453
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:49,320
By the grace of God,
I missed.

1454
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,640
But what if he had been shot?

1455
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,960
How would I explain it to you?
How would I explain it to myself?

1456
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:02,000
I can't understand why
Jai didn't surrender himself to me?

1457
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:05,880
Has he forgotten
that we are brothers?

1458
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,320
That your blood runs in our body!

1459
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:12,560
Brother!

1460
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:15,560
Jai, you're here?

1461
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:18,080
Brother, brother!

1462
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:20,880
Brother, please forgive me.

1463
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:26,040
-Mom, mom, please believe--
-I believe you, son.

1464
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,720
Just once, put your
hand on my head

1465
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,640
and say that you're innocent.

1466
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,480
I swear on you mom,
I am absolutely innocent.

1467
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:39,040
And from now on, from now
on I'll do what brother says.

1468
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,880
Here brother. Arrest me.

1469
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,040
Don't worry Jai...

1470
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:55,160
this brother of yours will
sacrifice his own life for yours.

1471
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,440
Brother!

1472
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:03,640
After going through the testimonies and
the evidence presented

1473
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:06,000
the court has come to the decision

1474
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:09,760
that criminal jai Verma is guilty.

1475
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:14,960
This court sentences him
to life imprisonment.

1476
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,040
Is this your justice, brother?

1477
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,960
No, this is absolutely wrong, judge.

1478
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,120
This is injustice towards honesty.

1479
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,720
And I won't let this happen.

1480
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,960
Officer! Arrest him!

1481
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,760
Shankar! Don't break the
rules of the court and law.

1482
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,080
-Hold him.
-Don't you dare, commissioner!

1483
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,680
Jai, come with me.

1484
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,560
They have to cross my
dead body before touching you.

1485
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,680
-Shankar!
-Brother!

1486
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,280
Shankar!

1487
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,400
-Brother!
-Shankar!

1488
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,800
<i>No, brother, you'll even sacrifice</i>
<i>your own life to save mine.</i>

1489
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:01,840
<i>And I don't want you</i>
<i>to dishonor your duty.</i>

1490
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,560
Excuse me, sir,
I have some important work with you.

1491
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,080
Ok, you come to my office
 tomorrow and meet me.

1492
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,600
One moment sir, it's
very urgent, one minute.

1493
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,920
Excuse me.
Yes, tell me, what is it?

1494
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,440
Sir, you said you
would give me that money?

1495
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:34,480
Yes, but the amount is quite big.

1496
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:37,000
But, because it's for
your sister's wedding

1497
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,040
I won't refuse.

1498
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:43,360
How about this...
Come over tonight...

1499
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,240
and your work will be done. Happy?

1500
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:47,920
Thanks.

1501
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:53,480
Give me a chance too,
to say thanks like that.

1502
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:55,640
See you.

1503
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:02,280
Let me get the money once,
I'll give you such a chance

1504
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,960
that you won't
be able to ask for a chance again.

1505
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,720
Neeru, you wait here...

1506
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,520
I'll go see that commander Mustaque.

1507
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:16,360
I am afraid, Jai.

1508
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,600
If anything happens to you...

1509
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,600
Don't worry.

1510
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,720
Shashi? She's here early.

1511
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:40,960
Hi!

1512
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:43,840
What are you doing here?

1513
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,080
Wherever I go, I always
drop by unannounced.

1514
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,200
Why?

1515
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:50,600
Actually, I was just going
to come out after having a bath.

1516
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:52,640
It's very important for
me to go out for a party.

1517
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:55,200
Sometimes, it's profitable
to cancel important programs

1518
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,080
for not so important meetings.

1519
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:00,440
Profit! What kind of a profit?

1520
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,760
You go and have a bath.

1521
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:06,160
I'll explain everything when you come out.

1522
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,920
I'll tell you everything.
Naughty boy!

1523
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,720
I'll make a drink. Go.

1524
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:14,960
I'll be right back.

1525
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:33,720
Darling, want a drink?

1526
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:40,720
I have been wishing for so long
to spend an evening with you.

1527
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:42,360
Here, have a drink.

1528
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:44,760
Darling!

1529
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:46,160
Drink it from my hands.

1530
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,600
Enough. Stop here.

1531
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:49,720
Here's your money.

1532
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,400
Hello.

1533
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:29,200
Mustaque has been murdered.
Get to his house.

1534
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:32,560
Both, the dead body and
the murderer are present there.

1535
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:46,400
Mustaque sir!

1536
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:51,840
Sir!

1537
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:57,920
Mustaque sir!

1538
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,120
Sir!

1539
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:06,960
Mustaque Sir!

1540
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:12,400
Sir!

1541
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:19,240
Oh, he's having a bath.

1542
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,720
Sir! Sir,
shall I take the money and go?

1543
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,160
I am in a hurry, sir.

1544
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,160
What happened?
Shashi what happened?

1545
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:38,840
That dead body!

1546
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:42,680
Oh my God! A murder!

1547
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,240
Jai... you have murdered him!

1548
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:46,320
What?

1549
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:48,560
You... you are a murderer!

1550
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,000
But why?

1551
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:51,720
What are you saying, Shashi?

1552
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,960
I am very sure that these
people had robbed the bank

1553
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:54,960
and put the blame on me.

1554
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:56,320
I came here to collect evidence,

1555
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,560
which will help me prove
myself innocent.

1556
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,320
But what are you doing here?

1557
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:02,600
I came here to take the
money for my sister's wedding.

1558
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,640
No one will believe us.

1559
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:06,080
Now what do we do?

1560
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,760
Now what do we do?

1561
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,880
You do one thing,
take this money

1562
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:13,680
and leave
before anyone gets here.

1563
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,320
And what about you, Jai?

1564
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:17,200
I'll destroy the evidence
that says we were here.

1565
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,160
No Jai, I can't leave you here.

1566
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:21,600
Please Shashi,
this is not the time to argue.

1567
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:22,720
Please, go.

1568
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,200
Sweety, here!

1569
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,800
-Brother, you?
-Now don't tell me

1570
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:52,920
that you have not committed this murder.

1571
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,480
I haven't done it brother, please, I...

1572
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:57,600
Nobody can save you now.

1573
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,600
Everything is equal before the law,
brother.

1574
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:11,800
I am asking you for the last time.
What's the truth?

1575
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,640
Nothing else is the
truth besides this, brother.

1576
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:17,720
The conditions and
helplessness have

1577
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:20,240
-have made me look like a criminal.
-No!

1578
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,320
You won't confess that easily.

1579
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:28,760
You won't confess that easily.

1580
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:31,160
I have to

1581
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:35,520
cross all limits.

1582
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:37,920
Ok?

1583
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:43,240
Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me what the truth is!

1584
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,760
Say it! Say it!

1585
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:49,560
Confess! Say it!

1586
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:02,040
I know, brother.

1587
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:05,200
These blows hurt you more than me.

1588
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,080
But believe me.

1589
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,080
I haven't done any murder,
I haven't done any robbery.

1590
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:10,520
Then what was that?

1591
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:15,240
I have seen you move that dead body
at the scene of the crime.

1592
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:20,320
Please, my brother,
tell me the truth, please!

1593
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:23,280
I have already told
you the truth, brother.

1594
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,880
Now I am ready,
even if I am to be hanged.

1595
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,640
But I won't let this happen.

1596
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,440
Who are you?

1597
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:32,480
She's my sister, sir.

1598
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:33,920
Please listen to
her statement, sir.

1599
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,480
Shankar,
I don't know why Jai is doing

1600
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,760
all this to save
that dancer, Sweety?

1601
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:41,680
I've seen her coming
out of Mustaque's flat.

1602
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:42,560
-Neeru, please.
-What?

1603
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:43,600
I don't understand...

1604
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:46,560
why do you want to
hang yourself for her?

1605
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:48,240
How is she related to you?

1606
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,520
No matter how much I hit you...

1607
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:06,200
My soul refused to believe that
you were a criminal.

1608
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,400
Then why did you do this?

1609
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:15,480
Tell me, why did you do this?

1610
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:18,280
For Shashi?

1611
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:20,800
No, brother, no.

1612
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,760
Shashi does not
deserve your sympathy.

1613
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:26,760
Please forgive me.

1614
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:12,360
Where did you
get this much money from?

1615
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:13,560
This is my money.

1616
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:15,760
Mustaque has given it to
me as an advance.

1617
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,360
Advance!

1618
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:22,640
I had given the briefcase
full of money to Mustaque.

1619
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,760
Mustaque has been murdered,
and the briefcase is with you.

1620
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:36,040
The evidence is enough
to hang you in my court.

1621
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,880
It's true that I
went to Mustaque's house...

1622
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:41,200
and that I took that
briefcase from his house.

1623
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,040
But at that time he was already dead.

1624
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,600
And there was only
his dead body over there.

1625
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:47,840
A dead body is what you
will now be. A living dead body.

1626
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:50,560
I'll make you sit in the club.

1627
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:54,000
Customers will come in plenty,
understand?

1628
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,600
I had already become
a dead body the day

1629
01:53:56,720 --> 01:54:00,080
you three bastards raped me.

1630
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:05,520
The three of you,
killed my dreams and my happiness.

1631
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:09,320
I still breath, just so that I can

1632
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:12,360
fulfill my responsibilities
towards my family.

1633
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,760
After killing my partners...

1634
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:18,200
you want to get your
sister married, you bitch!

1635
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:22,960
Biswas and Mustaque were lucky,
that they died easily...

1636
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:27,360
but today you'll have to suffer.

1637
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,680
I'll kill you bitch!

1638
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,440
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1639
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,920
No Shashi, he does not
deserve to be killed like that!

1640
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:08,000
No Shankar,
please let me kill him!

1641
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:10,120
You don't know how much
this jerk has made me suffer.

1642
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:12,520
This swine will suffer for his sins.

1643
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:13,720
He'll definitely suffer!

1644
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,600
He'll definitely suffer!

1645
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:22,160
Don't cry, Shashi, don't cry.

1646
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:27,120
You were mine no matter what...

1647
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:31,000
you are mine,
and you'll always be mine.

1648
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:53,080
Move, move, move!

1649
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:56,520
You have made my
life worse than hell.

1650
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,920
When people celebrate
their wedding anniversary...

1651
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:04,280
at that time, their wives
apply lipstick, they wear

1652
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:08,480
flowers in their hair,
they wear a sari...

1653
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,960
and hug their husbands with a smile.

1654
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:15,880
But you, bringing your tar like
face next to mine,

1655
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:19,480
removing your tongue out,
throwing spit out,

1656
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:21,960
you just roam about
licking everything, every time.

1657
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,000
Until this curse is not lifted.

1658
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:25,840
I will not live with
you in your house.

1659
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:26,960
I won't live with you,

1660
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:29,400
I won't eat with you,
I won't sleep with you.

1661
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:30,360
I'll live here!

1662
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:33,920
"Under the blue sky,
where the love for earth is born."

1663
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:36,960
Not where the love for
the earth is born...

1664
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:40,720
but where this dog's love is born.

1665
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:46,760
These dogs are cuter than wives.
They are more honest.

1666
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:50,640
Now take my wife for example,
she loves later...

1667
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:53,240
but first,
she hits me with her shoe.

1668
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:54,680
She hits me with her slipper.

1669
01:56:54,840 --> 01:57:00,280
She puts false allegations on us.

1670
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:04,680
She says that I am having an
affair with our neighbor, Champa.

1671
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:07,200
There is no Champa
in our neighborhood.

1672
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,360
At least tell me
who this Champa is?

1673
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:14,000
This dog is more honest
and cute than such a wife.

1674
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:15,600
Come, my darling!

1675
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:18,640
Hey! Just move from there,
move, move behind.

1676
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:21,720
"Whenever I see
a Tommy my heart says"

1677
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:24,400
"Ohle-ohle, ohle, ohle-ohle, ohle."

1678
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,920
Hey Pushpi,
forget about this drunkard

1679
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,520
but don't you have any shame?

1680
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:32,160
Hey brother, this is not your Tommy,
this is my wife...

1681
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:35,600
"Have you seen such a foolish
who's calling Tommy his wife"

1682
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:40,360
"Ohle-ohle, ohle, ohle-ohle, ohle."

1683
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,560
How many times should
I tell you that she is my wife?

1684
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:44,800
-You donkey! That is a dog.
-She is my wife.

1685
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:46,680
-It is a dog.
-She is my wife.

1686
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,600
He is a dog. Look at his tail.

1687
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:50,080
Shall I show you my tail?

1688
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:52,400
-Do you have a tail?
-Yes, I have.

1689
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:55,960
I caught you. Today,
I caught you openly with Champa.

1690
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,640
-No, no, no, no...
-You shameless.

1691
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,800
-Did he misbehave with your wife?
-He hugged her.

1692
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:03,240
If I had not caught him,
God knows

1693
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,800
what he would have done.

1694
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:08,280
-You shameless.
-No, no, no, no, no...

1695
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:10,560
but she is not Champa, it's a dog.

1696
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,440
-Is it a dog?
-Yes, see.

1697
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:19,440
Pushpi, wedding anniversary!

1698
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:22,360
Such a big bomb fell on me,
do you know?

1699
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:23,520
Pushpi!

1700
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:24,600
Pushpi!

1701
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:28,840
You jerk!
You're calling a young lady a dog?

1702
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,920
I know that this
is your Champa.

1703
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:34,480
You swine, couldn't you
find anyone else's husband?

1704
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,960
-Stop hitting on my husband!
-Quiet, quiet, quiet.

1705
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:39,520
This is not Champa.
She is my wife...

1706
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,680
Pushpa, sub-inspector, Pushpa.

1707
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:44,240
And your husband loves only you,
understand?

1708
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:45,640
-What?
-Yes darling, yes.

1709
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,200
This Tommy is telling the truth.

1710
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:51,760
-She's my wife.
-Yes darling,

1711
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,680
if you stop doubting me

1712
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,760
then I'll quit drinking.

1713
01:58:56,360 --> 01:58:58,200
-Really?
-Yes.

1714
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,520
So sweet!

1715
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,760
This is unexpected.

1716
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,560
She has started kissing me.

1717
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:05,800
Kiss me again.

1718
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:08,600
"Don't do all this acting here,
go to your house, and"

1719
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:11,720
"Sleep-sleep,
sleep, sleep-sleep, sleep."

1720
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,200
-Bye Tommy.
-Shut up!

1721
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:14,400
Sleep-sleep!

1722
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,360
Happy anniversary darling!

1723
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,720
-Congratulations!
-What happened?

1724
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:20,920
You'll turn into that dog again!

1725
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:24,520
Santu...

1726
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:27,720
It's a good thing that the
inspector's brother was caught.

1727
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:31,560
I was afraid that
I'd be the next victim.

1728
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:34,960
Here my darling, take this.

1729
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,160
Inspector!

1730
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:43,520
Come inspector, come.

1731
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:48,000
I am not that educated,
but I know this much...

1732
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:51,360
that you've come here
to bail your brother out, right?

1733
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:56,160
But brother, in this case
even a minister can't do anything.

1734
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:57,440
Don't say that, sir.

1735
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,240
-Madam, may I get a glass of water?
-Sure.

1736
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:04,560
Sir, you can do
anything you want.

1737
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:09,360
Yes, I can do anything I want,
but I won't.

1738
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:11,920
Your rascal
brother was caught

1739
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,720
with the dead body in the club.

1740
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:18,080
Not once, but twice. And
both of them were my best friends.

1741
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:20,760
I'll go to the court
and give a statement,

1742
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,440
that rascal should be hanged.

1743
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:26,440
No Raghu darling, don't yell.

1744
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:29,560
It's every citizen's duty
to help the police.

1745
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:30,560
Here you go.

1746
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:40,280
Do you recognize this earring?

1747
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:44,160
Did you tense up on seeing this?

1748
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:45,960
I am not tensed,
but I am shocked

1749
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,200
to hear such a silly question.

1750
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:49,840
Obviously, this earring
must belong to some woman.

1751
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,360
Even I know that.

1752
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:54,280
But which woman wears
this earring...

1753
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:55,800
is an important question.

1754
02:00:56,760 --> 02:01:00,280
Because the police found this
earring near Mustaque's dead body.

1755
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:04,960
What are you trying to say,
that this earring belongs to my darling?

1756
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:07,960
You consider me the murderer?

1757
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:12,160
Look inspector,
no need to jump so much.

1758
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:15,080
Otherwise, I will strip
you of your uniform

1759
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:16,480
and send you home.

1760
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:18,640
Mind your tongue, Raghunath Singh.

1761
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:21,360
You were present when the minister

1762
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:23,840
was depositing the party's
money into the bank.

1763
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:27,000
Sheela and you have been a
bit too friendly with both

1764
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:29,040
General Mustaque and Biswas.

1765
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:31,560
It's enough to have
you both listed as suspects.

1766
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:34,480
Only time will tell

1767
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:36,120
whether Sheela
committed the murder or not.

1768
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:39,520
Because the murderer's fingerprints
are on this earring.

1769
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:42,840
Anyway, do you both mind if
I take this glass along with me?

1770
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:45,760
You want to take the
glass and implicate us?

1771
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:47,880
Don't you know
what my identity is?

1772
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,160
I know your identity very well.

1773
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:54,080
I just need to expose
it to everyone.

1774
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:58,480
Which jerk has called up now?

1775
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,480
-Hello.
-Raghunath.

1776
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:05,040
The police is raiding all of
our hideouts.

1777
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:08,240
We should take the stuff and immediately
leave the country.

1778
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:10,720
Get the key and meet me at
the cold storage, quickly.

1779
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,800
Don't worry. I am on my way.

1780
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:03,760
It's such a dangerous place.

1781
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:06,360
Have you hidden the key here?

1782
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:09,280
That's not an ordinary key...

1783
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:13,200
it's our passport to heaven,
passport and visa, visa.

1784
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:19,080
And this is your ticket.

1785
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,120
Death, from your own gun.

1786
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:27,440
You bitch, Raghunath is
the kind of dog

1787
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:32,480
who, if he does not get a bone,
he bites his own master.

1788
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:34,800
This is your injection.

1789
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,400
Bitch!

1790
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:48,560
You could kill me...
I had never even thought of this.

1791
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:51,720
You, my friend, would be a cheater.

1792
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:55,200
You have drowned me.

1793
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:58,480
You left your earring
in Mustaque's bed

1794
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:01,560
and you hesitate
to sleep with me.

1795
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:03,200
Bitch!

1796
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:05,560
You never understood me, Raghu.

1797
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:08,760
I was crazy about you.

1798
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:13,320
Once, just one last time,
please hug me.

1799
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:16,480
-Are you telling the truth?
-Yes.

1800
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:20,520
-You... you really loved me?
-Yes.

1801
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:25,800
What happened, my queen?
What happened?

1802
02:04:58,840 --> 02:05:04,720
Chairman... you? Khanna!

1803
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:07,400
Forget about the people near him...

1804
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:11,720
even the one who gave birth to Khanna
couldn't understand him.

1805
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:14,160
You couldn't recognize me, could you?

1806
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:19,880
I... I understand,
you gave me this...

1807
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:24,520
this revolver filled with fake bullets.

1808
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:28,600
But... But...
why did you do all this?

1809
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:29,840
Why?

1810
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:31,720
-For what?
-For what?

1811
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:35,240
I'll tell you,
I'll tell you everything.

1812
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:37,480
I'll tell you the whole game.

1813
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,840
I took a huge amount
of money from the bank.

1814
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:42,680
The inquiry started taking place.

1815
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:45,520
When the minister
decided to collect the money...

1816
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:48,160
a plan formed
in my mind.

1817
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:53,120
I met you as Sheela,
made the plan of robbing the bank

1818
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,720
so that the blame of
the money which I had robbed

1819
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:58,480
comes on those robbers.

1820
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:01,560
And it worked!

1821
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:06,680
And then,
I killed everyone one by one.

1822
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,520
Only the general remains now.

1823
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:12,120
He won't escape.

1824
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:15,400
All this wealth will be mine.

1825
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:19,760
The chairman will be back on his
chair, and Sheela will disappear.

1826
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:28,800
You'll keep on searching for me,
you'll keep on searching for me.

1827
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:33,680
What? You want a kiss?
You want a kiss?

1828
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:38,960
You'll want my kiss!

1829
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:00,120
Raghunath Singh!

1830
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:11,040
No, don't kill me, Sheela!
Don't kill me, Sheela!

1831
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:13,840
Don't kill me!

1832
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:17,280
Don't kill me!

1833
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,480
No! No!

1834
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:23,280
Don't kill me!

1835
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:26,200
Chairman Khanna! Chairman Khanna!

1836
02:08:26,280 --> 02:08:28,040
Yes, I am chairman Khanna.

1837
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:32,200
Inspector Shankar,
please take me to the hospital.

1838
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,600
Take me to the...

1839
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:46,240
I kept pleading.

1840
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:51,560
I knew neither day, nor night.

1841
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:57,520
They used to hold me in darkness,
in my own urine.

1842
02:08:57,720 --> 02:08:59,480
I used to live in my own dirt.

1843
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:04,840
Can you tell us their
names and how they looked?

1844
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,680
Yes, never,
I can never forget that name.

1845
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:16,080
Biswas, Mustaque,
there was a boy...

1846
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:23,800
who won the dance competition,
Jai, Jai Verma.

1847
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,000
The chairman is alive?

1848
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:30,280
But the criminals
had killed Khanna.

1849
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:32,800
-What?
-Yes, brother, this is the truth.

1850
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:34,240
We have seen it with our own eyes.

1851
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:36,160
Yes, brother, think about it.

1852
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:38,960
Why would such dangerous
people leave Khanna alive?

1853
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:48,960
-Yes sir?
-It's a phone call for you.

1854
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:51,120
For me? Here?

1855
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:53,960
Look, I don't like it when your
personal phone-calls come here.

1856
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:55,600
Stop this, otherwise I'll complain.

1857
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:58,960
-Sorry sir. I don't know how...
-It's all right. Take it.

1858
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:03,880
Hello! Hello!

1859
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:29,320
Yes, good.

1860
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:32,920
-Hello!
-Sir, sir we found Sheela's file.

1861
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:34,920
Sir, we found the file.

1862
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:37,400
We even found the chairman's driver,
Bhim Singh.

1863
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:38,320
Good, sir.

1864
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:40,720
Dead!

1865
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:47,800
The body was buried
in Sheela's house.

1866
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:51,040
But sir, two years have
passed since Sheela died.

1867
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:54,960
According to the file,
she died two years back.

1868
02:10:58,440 --> 02:10:59,520
It's so strange.

1869
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:03,440
Sheela died. She came back to life.

1870
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:08,680
The chairman died. He came back to life.

1871
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:14,560
-Hello.
-Hello inspector.

1872
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:15,960
This is Sheela speaking.

1873
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:19,720
The chairman is with me.
Here, talk to him.

1874
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:24,480
Inspector...
inspector, please save me!

1875
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:26,240
This... this Sheela will kill me!

1876
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:27,560
Please save me!

1877
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:28,440
Give me the phone!

1878
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:32,200
Look inspector,
put 10 lakh rupees in a bag...

1879
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:35,200
and come to Nehru park gate
exactly at 11:00.

1880
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:39,200
I'll cut him into pieces
if you try to follow me.

1881
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:42,440
Come on, Jai!

1882
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:45,320
What? Is your brother the commissioner?

1883
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:46,800
Go in, go, go.

1884
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:02,080
Everything is all right.

1885
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:05,440
-Good evening, doctor.
-Good evening.

1886
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:21,240
Why are you crying?

1887
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:22,760
So what if your wife
gave birth to a girl?

1888
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:24,960
-Children are God's...
-What is this daughter-daughter?

1889
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:26,480
My father has expired.

1890
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:31,200
-Where is the chairman?
-Inside, in his room.

1891
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:53,720
General!

1892
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:56,720
Why are you so late?

1893
02:12:57,240 --> 02:12:59,400
It's terrible!
Raghunath has been murdered!

1894
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:00,720
-He has been murdered!
-Yes...

1895
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:03,520
-Where's the key?
-Don't worry, the key is here,

1896
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,640
near my heart.

1897
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:12,440
I don't understand how
that chairman came back to life?

1898
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:16,800
-What! Don't you know anything?
-What do you mean?

1899
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:19,360
That Raghunath and chairman
were behind this plan.

1900
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:20,600
Raghunath had just pretended

1901
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:22,480
to kill the chairman
in front of you.

1902
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,240
And that chairman had killed

1903
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,880
Biswas and Mustaque one by one.

1904
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:28,520
Today, they were both
going to kill you and me...

1905
02:13:28,680 --> 02:13:30,480
but thank God the
police got there on time.

1906
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:33,120
I faced a lot of difficulties
on my way here.

1907
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:37,760
You bitch!
Do you think I am a fool?

1908
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:41,520
God knows everything,
both the secret and the result.

1909
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:46,240
I've come to know your truth.

1910
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:48,440
What kind of truth?

1911
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:52,600
Clicking an intimate photograph
with the chairman...

1912
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:55,600
kidnapping the chairman in the
dark from his house...

1913
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:59,680
the death of Raghunath,
the chairman appearing again...

1914
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:03,600
all this is planned by you
and that bastard, chairman.

1915
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:05,720
Mine and chairman's?

1916
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:07,880
Yes, yours and chairman's.

1917
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:11,760
You and that chairman murdered Biswas,
Mustaque and Raghunath.

1918
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:14,720
Today I won't spare you.
I'll kill you, you bitch.

1919
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:17,720
Please spare me!
Please let me go! I beg of you!

1920
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,320
Khanna was blackmailing me.

1921
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:21,640
He had some
naked photographs of mine.

1922
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:24,480
Please take me along with you!
Please take me along with you!

1923
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:27,160
I'll accept whatever you give me.
I'll even accept 40 percent.

1924
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:31,520
40 percent! Today, I'll cut you
into 40 pieces! I'll kill you!

1925
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:34,360
I'll kill you! You bitch!

1926
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:56,600
Are you distributing your shares?

1927
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:00,600
So finally you have arrived,
Shankar. Good!

1928
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:03,480
And me too, the most important
criminal in this robbery.

1929
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:06,080
Sheela, where is the chairman?

1930
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:08,920
I won't tell you.
The chairman is with me.

1931
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:11,720
Good!

1932
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:15,080
Wrong, the chairman is with Jai.

1933
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:21,880
No brother, you're forgetting,
the chairman is with you.

1934
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:26,280
Sheela, what nonsense is this?

1935
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:29,480
This is not nonsense, it's
a very interesting story...

1936
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:34,480
which starts from the death of
the driver of the chairman of the bank

1937
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:38,240
and ends at the murder of a nurse.

1938
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:45,520
That nurse, whose hair was cut
by the murderer after her murder.

1939
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:50,840
Can you tell me why
the murderer did that, Sheela?

1940
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:53,120
Because up until now,
that murderer...

1941
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:55,720
had been blaming someone else.

1942
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:01,840
But now he wanted to cover
his bald head, right Sheela?

1943
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:07,720
No, it's not right,
This is not Sheela...

1944
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:09,960
but chairman Khanna.

1945
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:11,200
Get lost.

1946
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:18,560
Excellent! Chairman!

1947
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:28,200
Only strength or
brains do not win a war.

1948
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:32,360
You need both strength
and brains to win a war...

1949
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:34,639
which Raghuvansh Singh has.

1950
02:16:45,879 --> 02:16:47,760
Shankar, I knew

1951
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:51,680
that you would smell the ground
and come here like a dog.

1952
02:16:56,559 --> 02:17:00,840
That's why I brought these girls.

1953
02:17:04,959 --> 02:17:09,080
Take these bastards away,
put them in the mincing machine!

1954
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:10,200
Take them away!

1955
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:18,200
Put these beautiful ladies on my ship.

1956
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:21,520
They are things to be taken abroad...

1957
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:23,840
they'll be with me day and night.

1958
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:26,200
Go! Go! Get lost!

1959
02:17:27,360 --> 02:17:30,840
Sir, I am very afraid of death...

1960
02:17:30,959 --> 02:17:33,920
We are both husband and wife.
Please tie us together.

1961
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:36,160
Please tie us together!

1962
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:39,920
Sir, if we can't eat or
drink without each other

1963
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,160
then why should we die
without each other?

1964
02:17:43,400 --> 02:17:47,639
I beg of you, sir, God will make
you a Super General instead of a General.

1965
02:17:47,959 --> 02:17:49,600
Please tie us together.

1966
02:17:49,799 --> 02:17:51,760
Tie them together!

1967
02:17:54,719 --> 02:17:58,320
Finish off this bastard!

1968
02:17:58,719 --> 02:18:00,440
Go.

1969
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:15,400
-"Listen."
-"Say."

1970
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:17,320
-"I said."
-"I heard."

1971
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:19,120
"Did something happen?"

1972
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:22,000
"Nothing, not yet."

1973
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:23,840
-"The breeze..."
-"Is moving."

1974
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:26,000
-"The cloud..."
-"Has stopped."

1975
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:27,480
"Did anything happen?"

1976
02:18:27,559 --> 02:18:29,480
"Something has happened."

1977
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:31,200
What's happening?

1978
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:32,879
Sir, even the devil fulfills

1979
02:18:32,959 --> 02:18:34,760
the last wish of
one who is dying.

1980
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:36,080
You are the Super Devil.

1981
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:40,280
Please give two minutes to
us husband-wife to bid goodbye.

1982
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:44,360
Ok, shoot these two
after two minutes.

1983
02:18:46,639 --> 02:18:47,520
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1984
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:48,799
Your boss told you
leave us alone, didn't he?

1985
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:50,719
Look there.

1986
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:57,400
"Something has happened."

1987
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:59,680
"Something has happened."

1988
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:05,440
Why didn't you shoot them yet?

1989
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:07,400
Give me the gun.

1990
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:51,160
You swine! You'll hit a police officer?

1991
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:52,400
You want to fight me?

1992
02:21:57,440 --> 02:21:58,360
Pushpi!

1993
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:07,080
Pushpi! Pushpi! Pushpi!

1994
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:10,240
Pushpi!

1995
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:19,440
Now you're dead!

1996
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:39,600
Load this bastard
along with the stuff and the car.

1997
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:41,440
Bring him! I'll see him later.

1998
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:37,840
Shankar! Shankar!

1999
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:54,800
This wealth is mine, you bastards!

2000
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:57,480
I won't spare anyone.

2001
02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:11,000
I kidnapped you?

2002
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:13,200
I robbed the bank?

2003
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:15,280
I murdered Biswas?

2004
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:17,000
I murdered Mustaque?

2005
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:19,600
No! No! No!

2006
02:24:19,960 --> 02:24:21,480
Please forgive me!

2007
02:24:21,560 --> 02:24:24,440
I didn't... do anything!
I didn't do anything!

2008
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:29,880
You bastard!

2009
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:34,360
Sheela has done everything,
right?

2010
02:24:34,520 --> 02:24:36,280
Sheela has done everything.

2011
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:49,400
Commissioner sir,
commissioner please save me!

2012
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:50,440
-Please save me!
-What happened?

2013
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:52,320
This police officer
wants to save his brother.

2014
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,720
He wants to take
away all the wealth.

2015
02:24:53,800 --> 02:24:55,080
This is not the truth, commissioner.

2016
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:57,800
He has made the plan.
He is Sheela.

2017
02:24:58,160 --> 02:24:59,400
Sheela? And I?

2018
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:00,640
Please trust me, sir.

2019
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:01,800
Trust.

2020
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:06,200
Everyone would believe you, chairman...

2021
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:08,480
but you made a mistake.

2022
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:11,920
You destroyed each and
every evidence of Sheela's

2023
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:15,720
but you forgot
to rub off this lipstick.

2024
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:22,800
If you are not Sheela,
then why are you wiping your lips?

2025
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:26,440
There isn't any
lipstick on your lips.

2026
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:29,360
-Arrest him!
-I won't spare you!

2027
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:30,920
I'll kill you!

2028
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:32,520
I won't spare any of you!

2029
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:37,600
I told you, don't do wrong.

2030
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:39,720
Now you have been implicated, haven't you?

2031
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:42,720
You were a fool,
and you'll always be.

2032
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:44,520
Why were you wiping your lipstick?

2033
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:48,760
Now I'll leave you and go away.
You implicated me.

2034
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:52,120
No darling! No darling! Please
don't leave me and go, darling!

2035
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:55,240
I'll be back to take the money!
I'll be back to take the money!

2036
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:57,640
Don't leave me and go!
I'll be back!

2037
02:25:59,360 --> 02:26:00,840
I'll be back!

2038
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:03,960
Sir! Sir! Sir!

2039
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:07,120
Please accept our leave
applications now.

2040
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:10,200
So that I can go to priest
Alakh Niranjan...

2041
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:12,120
touch his feet and tell him that...

2042
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:14,640
Priest! At least now,
give us freedom, priest!
