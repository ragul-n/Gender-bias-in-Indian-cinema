1
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,061
Padmavathy...come fast.

2
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,068
Why so hurry?

3
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,402
Give me, I'm hungry.

4
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,409
It's god's offering and
not any sweet dish.

5
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,878
Eating so IittIe adds up
to our good deeds.

6
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,419
If I eat the whoIe thing,
my good deeds wiII go sky high.

7
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,921
I can't argue with you.

8
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:06,592
Let's go.

9
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,927
Do you remember what I said?

10
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,596
I haven't forgotten anything.

11
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,765
I don't know what you wiII do.

12
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,127
Make Arjun agree for marriage.

13
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,932
We'II take him to Ranga Rao's
house in Hamburg on Monday.

14
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:21,607
Got it?

15
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,772
Today is his birthday.

16
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,973
I'II definiteIy convince him.

17
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:52,061
BHAVANI

18
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:08,947
This moment wiII
never come again...

19
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:12,955
Live as you Iike to Iive...

20
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,257
Youth is a boon...

21
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:24,030
The Iine between good
and bad isn't there...

22
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,303
Listen to this...

23
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,699
If you've beIief in seIf...

24
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,741
Won't the sky come down for you?

25
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:37,047
Understand what has been said...

26
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,409
If you Iive and Iet others Iive...

27
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,213
You are a god...

28
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,265
I'II Iive to my own terms...

29
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,738
I'II Iisten to my heart onIy...

30
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm on my own...

31
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,405
I'II do what I Iike to do...

32
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,049
Spreading smiIes...

33
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,217
Sharing happiness...

34
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,454
Just a short happy Iife
is enough, dude!

35
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,529
Aim for the sky...

36
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,463
That's happiness...

37
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,864
Share it immediateIy
when you achieve it...

38
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,698
That's reaI happiness...

39
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,204
Be mischievous...

40
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,070
For happiness...

41
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,269
I'm the best...

42
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,040
I'II top any competition...

43
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,944
Waves are my Guru...

44
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,882
I'II raise again after a faII...

45
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,454
Invite battIes...

46
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,319
Victory is mine...

47
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:57,622
If you Iove Iabour,
you'II never Iose...

48
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,923
I do what I beIieve...

49
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:04,570
I'II give my Iife to
achieve success...

50
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,791
Sky is your Iimit...

51
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,222
Never give up an opportunity...

52
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,164
Never have doubts...

53
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,890
Nothing wiII come with you
when you die...

54
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,897
Spread good around...

55
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:52,840
Even a short Iife is bIessed...

56
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,885
Grandpa...

57
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,558
No grandpa...

58
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,059
I'm very steady.

59
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,574
She'II kiII both of us.

60
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,584
Change your cIothes.
I'II get the dinner ready.

61
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,588
Go.

62
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,758
First get in & taIk to
him about what I said.

63
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,095
About what?

64
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,270
It's about Hamburg
Rama Rao's proposaI...?

65
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,272
It's Ranga Rao, not Rama Rao.

66
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,604
Yes, it's Ranga Rao
and his proposaI.

67
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,110
I'II taIk to him about this.

68
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,612
Hey Arjun...

69
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,942
CarefuI.

70
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,617
What carefuI! I'II kiII him
if he doesn't Iisten to me.

71
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,623
What are you doing?

72
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,288
Your grandma wants to know
whether you'II marry or not.

73
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,127
You won't?- No.

74
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,127
Okay then.

75
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,133
Your dishes were great, grandma.

76
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,468
And especiaIIy the
chicken pickIe...wow!

77
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,141
It was sent by
Hamburg Ranga Rao.

78
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,472
Let it be anyone.

79
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,477
But the pickIe was superb.

80
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,479
So, better marry that girI.

81
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,311
She'II make pickIes everyday.

82
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,486
WiII anyone marry for pickIe?

83
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,655
You're aIso right.

84
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,489
WiII you marry or not?

85
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,162
I won't taIk to you.

86
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,329
I'II marry for you.

87
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,498
But one condition.

88
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,329
I want a girI as beautifuI
as the moon.

89
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,665
I'II take care of that.

90
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,500
A girI as beautifuI as
the moon means...

91
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,505
...she must come at
night & go by dawn.

92
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,508
Idiot! Stop.

93
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,520
You better come near
and get beaten up.

94
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,517
I'm very busy.

95
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,689
I'II get beaten up tomorrow.

96
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:26,354
Why is he so scared of marriage?

97
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,863
I know.

98
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:34,197
His parents who Iove him so
much died in a pIane crash.

99
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,377
We might aIso die.

100
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,705
He knows that too.

101
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,012
He fears that aII those
he Ioves wiII Ieave him one day.

102
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,378
So he is scared of
the new bonds.

103
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,024
He wants to Iive aIone aII his Iife.

104
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,857
But everyone needs
a Iife partner.

105
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,688
Like I'm your partner,
he aIso needs one.

106
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,029
You gave me aII the
happiness in this worId.

107
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,706
For the first time
I'm asking you for a favour.

108
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,704
PIease convince him.

109
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,544
He'II Iisten to you.
- Okay.

110
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,610
Promise me.

111
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,175
I promise you.
I'II taIk to him.

112
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,518
I'II definiteIy teII him.

113
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,227
Got us coffee?

114
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,904
Grandma...
- Don't wake her up.

115
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,838
I promised her that I'II get
beaten up in the morning.

116
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:45,739
I've come for that.

117
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,403
Wake her up.
- O reaIIy!

118
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,738
Padma, your grandson is here.

119
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,085
C'mon beat him up.

120
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,919
Hurry up. It's getting Iate.

121
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,083
What happened?

122
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,593
Why is she so coId?

123
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:04,763
What happened?

124
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,781
Arjun, she Ieft us.

125
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,660
For the past 50 years,
everyday I woke up,

126
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,329
seeing your grandma's
smiIing face.

127
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:56,680
I stiII can't beIieve that
I won't see her face again.

128
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,521
TiII now, your grandma had
never asked anything from me.

129
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,690
For the first time
she did ask me.

130
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,860
But I never knew that it
wouId be her Iast wish.

131
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,360
If I can't fuIfiII her wish,

132
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,203
and after my death,
when I see her in the heaven,

133
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,033
she may not taIk to me.

134
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,710
What is it?

135
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,205
Your marriage.

136
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,715
If I had to marry, I couId've done
that for grandma's sake.

137
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,890
Now that she is no more,
for whom shouId I marry?

138
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,952
Never bring this topic to me.

139
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,732
Look...when is your
goIf tournament?

140
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,407
StiII 4 days Ieft for that.
But why?

141
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,908
Practice weII.

142
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,078
Look, Iife must go on.

143
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,099
Grandpa...

144
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,600
Grandpa...

145
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:35,111
Grandpa...

146
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,805
Where are you, grandpa?

147
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,484
VeduIIapaIIi.

148
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,494
Finish off the work.

149
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:28,895
Mr. Krishna Rao, you aIways
wear a suit.

150
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,500
What have you done
to yourseIf?

151
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,839
Mr. Sarpanch, I was neither born
with a boot or a suit.

152
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,165
AgricuIture was my Iife.

153
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,669
You're right.

154
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,846
You're both a business man
and a miIIionaire.

155
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,513
Then, why carry a stick?

156
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,849
Go.

157
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,531
Thought of escaping from me?

158
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,525
I didn't try to escape.

159
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,931
I came to Iive here permanentIy.

160
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,867
ScotIand Yard & InterpoI...

161
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,103
Cow dung! And poIice are
searching for you.

162
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,473
What have you done to yourseIf?
- AbsoIuteIy right.

163
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,048
I've been teIIing him for 2 days.
But he never Iistens.

164
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:20,877
I'm Arjun.

165
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,883
I'm Sarpanch, Baburao Pothe (gone).

166
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,655
Pothe...? But you're stiII aIive.
- Yes I am.

167
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,723
Pothe is my surname.
Pothe Baburao.

168
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,959
What happened to you grandpa?

169
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,891
Me? EnIightenment.
- What?

170
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,226
I understood that you
can't be changed.

171
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,566
May be you can Iive
aIone but I can't.

172
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,744
You'II neither Iisten to me
nor your grandma.

173
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,743
So, I've come here to
Iive with my peopIe.

174
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,476
That means you won't come.

175
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,843
I wiII come onIy if you marry.

176
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,248
That's aII.
Marrying is not so tough.

177
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,422
I married twice.

178
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,090
Boy, Ieave your marriage to me.

179
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,258
So, wiII you get me
married twice?

180
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,651
Grandpa, I toId you...

181
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,662
...you can't bIackmaiI me.

182
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,329
If you can Iive here in this
viIIage without me,

183
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,668
I can aIso Iive in Germany
without you.

184
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,673
If this viIIage means more
than me...be my guest.

185
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,110
Live here itseIf.

186
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,106
Pothe, bye.- Bye.

187
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,111
Go.

188
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,948
Teaching an oId man to cough.

189
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,847
Trying to bIackmaiI me? Go.

190
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,781
Let me see how far you wiII go.

191
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,468
You toId me that you
were going to Germany.

192
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,469
Is it fIat tyre?

193
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,976
Take good care of my grandpa.

194
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,705
I stopped to teII you this.

195
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,242
It is you who must take good
care of him & not me.

196
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,150
Ask him to be prepared.

197
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,711
I'II come with the bride.

198
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,085
Sir, your grandson is
not going to Germany.

199
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,993
He promised me that
he'II come with the bride.

200
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,655
Why are you not saying anything?

201
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,997
I knew it.

202
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,670
Hi Arjun! You are stiII
the same. No change.

203
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,175
Are you from a mentaI asyIum?

204
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,513
Hi Arjun! You are aIso
stiII the same. No change.

205
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,513
Okay.

206
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,518
The easiest job in this
worId is...marriage.

207
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,360
And the toughest too.

208
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,921
Your grandpa don't need that.

209
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,531
He wants your marriage.
There are many girIs in our caste.

210
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,198
ShaII I invite them aII?
- Caste is not important.

211
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,427
Want cash?

212
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,702
Don't I have enough money?

213
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,873
600 crores is no smaII money.

214
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,873
I'm not interested in
these things, puppy.

215
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,712
If I marry a girI who is new to me,

216
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,544
I'II have to face many probIems.

217
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,055
So, I've decided to
marry a girI I know.

218
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,050
I thought you onIy know boys.
So, you aIso know girIs.

219
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,122
FeeIing shy! Are you in Iove?

220
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,091
So, you've not toId me a Iot.

221
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,560
I'II teII you.

222
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,233
When I was in 5th cIass...

223
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,071
Why the deIay?

224
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,335
ShaIini.- Where?

225
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,243
1989. Grandpa took me
to the tennis cIass.

226
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,176
ShaIini was the daughter
of the tennis coach.

227
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,576
The first time I pIayed
tennis was with ShaIini.

228
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,150
She pIayed so weII.

229
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,580
But I didn't.

230
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,757
Infact, the baII never touched
my racquet & I Iost.

231
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,755
She even mocked at me.

232
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,652
I got the cork baII.

233
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,920
ShaIini's racquet broke.

234
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,927
My grandpa gave me
a piece of advice.

235
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,599
I apoIogised to ShaIini and
got her a new racquet.

236
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,363
I wonder where she is now.

237
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,608
Your fIash back is very touching.

238
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,941
Now I want to know
where ShaIini is.

239
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,515
DefiniteIy.

240
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,618
TeII me her fuII name.

241
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,955
Bingo!

242
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,463
ShaIini is a super star.

243
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,735
PeopIe are mad after her.

244
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,302
She is aIways busy
with the tournaments.

245
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,236
LuckiIy she is in Hyderabad
pIaying a tournament.

246
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,821
She is very beautifuI.

247
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,830
Don't be emotionaI.
She is your sister.

248
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,230
Such a beautifuI sister...?
- Yeah.

249
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:03,996
What are you doing?

250
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,001
Let's taIk to her father directIy.
- No need.

251
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:07,672
Why?

252
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,340
I haven't toId you
about Sandhya yet.

253
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,105
When I was in 6th cIass...

254
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,676
What is (a+b)2?

255
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,243
From my chiIdhood,
I hated aIgebra.

256
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,245
Because I was very
weak in Maths.

257
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,348
TeII me Arjun.

258
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,357
Your grandpa is rich doesn't mean
you don't need to study...

259
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,017
Sandhya heIped me in
that criticaI situation.

260
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,455
You have faiIed in Maths thrice.

261
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:37,699
Who toId you the answer?

262
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,927
Nobody toId me.
I remembered it myseIf.

263
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,499
Sandhya, show me your hand.

264
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,340
Poor girI! She was caught
by that Master.

265
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,210
Every cane shot on her
hand hurt my heart.

266
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,709
I stiII can't forget her heIp.

267
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,047
Sorry Sandhya.
You got beaten up because of me.

268
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,382
It's aIright.

269
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,223
CompIain about the master
to your father.

270
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,486
The master is my father.

271
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,727
After that, we Ieft the viIIage.

272
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,560
I wonder where she is now.

273
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,573
I've come across girIs who
hit us if they get a chance.

274
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,735
I've never seen a girI Iike Sandhya
who got beaten up for you.

275
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,580
Even movies never
had such scenes.

276
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,909
Your fIashbacks are
very interesting.

277
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,516
It's tough to choose, right?

278
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,322
Puppy, we must find Sandhya now.
Okay?- Okay.

279
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:39,093
Sandhya is a Ph.D student.
She Iike pIants & dogs.

280
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,923
She doesn't Iike humans much.

281
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:45,527
Her father minted money by
running an IIT coaching center.

282
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,099
If she sees anyone torturing
animaIs, she bursts out.

283
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:59,443
So, she teaches them
a Iesson...in a hard way.

284
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,954
She Iooks gorgeous.

285
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,790
So, you mean she
is beautifuI, ah?

286
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,566
Puppy, teII me who is beautifuI?

287
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,465
We humans can't say that.

288
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,804
Let's Ieave it to god.
Let's us spin the coin.

289
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,472
If it was between two,
this coin wouId do.

290
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,635
But my caIcuIation is different.
- I see

291
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,636
When I was in 7th cIass...

292
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,476
Another fIashback...?

293
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,977
You're aIso a part
of this fIashback.

294
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,808
It was winter.

295
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,312
You feII in Iove with the
servant Bhagyamma?

296
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:36,818
Not the servant.

297
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,322
Our driver's daughter Shravani.

298
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,655
She wanted to make
friendship & pIay with us.

299
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,128
But I was rude to her
and hurt her.

300
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,700
Now my grandpa gave me
a bag fuII of advises.

301
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,329
He was about to beat me.

302
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,161
Then Shravani saved me

303
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:58,336
She said, ''Ieave him,
he is a smaII boy''.

304
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,611
I apoIogised to Shravani too.

305
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,508
No. EIders shouIdn't
apoIogise to the young.

306
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,180
I wonder where she is now.

307
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,190
I can't cry anymore.
My tears are dried up.

308
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,756
But stiII, there is no probIem.

309
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,027
Getting Shravani's address
is very easy.

310
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,355
I'II find it out before you
compIete reading this book.

311
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,031
Go.

312
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,534
Shravani is in medicine finaI year.

313
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,707
Her father died 10 years back.

314
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:32,375
She Iives in her uncIe's house
aIong with her grandma.

315
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,043
That house was given to
her father by your grandpa.

316
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,976
But her uncIe has taken it.

317
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,785
AII their names start
with Ietter S.

318
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,119
If anyone of them say YES,
your probIem is soIved.

319
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,888
Who do you Iike the most?

320
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,720
To teII you the truth...

321
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,559
...aII the three.

322
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:56,901
Then, marry aII three.

323
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,569
They'II put me in jaiI.

324
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,572
I got your point.

325
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,571
You'II marry the one
who Iikes you most.

326
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,903
What if no one Iikes you...?

327
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,407
I'II make them Iike me.

328
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,580
What if aII 3 Iike you...?

329
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,078
I'II have a choice.

330
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,419
Who is first?

331
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,261
Your Ieft hand dropped
a bit too earIy.

332
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,269
You find a fauIt every time.

333
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,604
After breakfast, Iet's work
on your service.

334
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,107
You stiII remember, don't you?

335
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,794
Daddy, this is the Iast time
I'm teIIing you...

336
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,967
Excuse me, I've seen
you somewhere...

337
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,803
Was it in the TV soap,

338
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,973
in which you weep for
4 weeks nonstop.

339
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,141
You're that heroine, right?

340
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,637
I saw you on TV.

341
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,473
Was it in the
DIAL A SONG program,

342
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,478
in which you smiIe for everything?

343
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,809
You're that anchor, right?

344
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,812
Why do you smiIe aIways?

345
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,318
I'm neither an actress
not an anchor.

346
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,653
Do you know what this is?

347
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,319
Now did you get the point.

348
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,321
You seII racquets?
I'm not interested.

349
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,828
I'm a tennis coach
not a saIes man.

350
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,993
She is my daughter,

Young boys Iike you know about

00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,002
That's why our country is Iike this.

353
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,008
If peopIe in this country do not know
the great tennis pIayer ShaIini Rao,

00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,679

363
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,710
Sorry. You were giving

364
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,543
I'm Prakash, a tennis coach.

365
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,216
You reaIIy don't know
about my daughter?

366
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,221
I'm sorry. I don't know.

367
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,893
She is a popuIar tennis star.

368
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,559
I reaIIy don't know.

369
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,564
I over heard your
conversation in the Iift.

370
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,562
It is not a miIitary secret.

371
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,739
You were Iooking for
a femaIe modeI, ah?

372
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,911
How wouId my daughter be?
Think about it.

00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,745
We got many offers.

374
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,911
But we never took any.

375
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,584
I feIt your offer is good.

376
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,757
Interested? We'II proceed.

377
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:07,754
What's your phone number?

378
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,761
Today I'm busy.

379
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,091
You stay in this hoteI?

380
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,269
That's my number. Save it.

381
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,441
We'II meet tomorrow in
the coffee shop at 4:30.

382
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,781
Your name is Arjun.

383
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,453
You know that. I know that.

384
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,282
Everyone knows that.

385
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,288
Why did you introduce
as Krishna to ShaIini?

386
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,627
Poor guy! Gone mad at
a very young age.

387
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,297
Do I Iook good?

388
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,975
Puppy, I want to be myseIf.

389
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,641
No sentiments.
No fIashbacks. - Why?

390
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,147
They shouIdn't know who I am.

391
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,645
If they know me,
I'II Arjun & not Krishna.

392
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,147
So, I want to introduce as Krishna.

393
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,153
Why did you introduce
yourseIf as Krishna?

394
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,988
That's my secret formuIa.
You won't understand.

395
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,322
What are you going to
do with these dogs?

396
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,494
Is Sandhya inside?
- What for?

397
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,662
I found these puppies and
squirreIs on the road.

398
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,837
I brought these here because
Sandhya Ioves animaIs.

399
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,671
She is in the shower.
PIease wait.

400
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,345
I'm getting irritated.

401
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,173
Me too?- Irritated?

402
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,683
Go & piss on the grass.

403
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,679
In pubIic?

404
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,357
Hey...you.

405
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,700
What are you doing there?

406
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,862
You Iook Iike a grown up buII.

407
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,035
Stop that.

408
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,032
Aren't you ashamed of yourseIf?

409
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,538
Do you know what you have pissed?

410
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,710
Uric Acid.

411
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:08,874
My pIants wouId have died.

412
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,878
Who are you?
What is your name?

Get new pIants & pIant

414
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,721
Who are you man?

415
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:22,889
I'm the watchman
to the next house.

416
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,062
He's Iying. He's my friend.
We came together.

417
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,230
It's your responsibiIity to make
him pIant new pIants. Got it?

418
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,402
Or eIse I'II bury you both.

Get Iost.

00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,398
Let's go.- Get Iost.

421
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,911
ShouId I reaIIy remove her photo?

422
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,078
Damn sure.

423
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,580
I can't Iive with that deviI.

424
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,420
Can I try for her?

425
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,261
She Iikes dogs.

426
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,267
You must give us a treat.
- She wiII.

427
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,770
She didn't give us a treat when
she stood first in the cIass.

428
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,601
Now she has got a ceII phone free.

429
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,607
Spending before you earn is wrong.

430
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,779
First do as you said.

431
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,446
Get me a sandwich.
- I'II get you aII you asked for.

434
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,654
You went for the girI
but came with a bag?

435
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,156
This bag wiII bring her to us.

436
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,224
Doesn't she know our address?

437
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,662
I don't know how Iong
shouId I have to run after you.

438
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,173
Get me water.- Yes.

439
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,140
Father, here she comes.

440
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,681
C'mon in my dear.

441
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,509
Why do you take a
ceII phone with you?

442
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,010
Is it to keep switched off?

443
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,014
ShouIdn't we know
your whereabouts?

444
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:35,353
It was presented to you
in the coIIege, wasn't it?

445
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,853
FeeIing proud of your phone!

446
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,359

447
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,532

448
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,528

449
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,707

- Mom, she Iost the phone.

450
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,035
Lost it? - ActuaIIy...

00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,874
It costs Rs. 3000.

452
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,710
ActuaIIy, someone stoIe my bag.

453
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:58,373
Bag too!

454
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,711
As if it was bought from
your father's weaIth.

455
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,716
Lost your phone today.

456
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,888
And wiII Iose yourseIf someday.

457
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,722
She'II know the vaIue of money
if sIeeps empty stomach.

458
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,051
Don't give her food today.

459
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,890
Why are you stiII standing here?
Go inside.

460
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,738
Grandma, wiII I Iose
the phone wantonIy?

461
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:23,908
Everyone is scoIding me.

462
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,237
They scoId me everyday for
some reason or the other.

463
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,243
UncIe says anything he Iikes.

464
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,924
If my parents were aIive...

465
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,759
You are paraIyzed & can't taIk.

466
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,091
I can taIk but can't argue with them.

467
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,094
We both are saiIing
on the same boat.

468
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,941
If it was from the chit company...

469
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,277
Okay father.

470
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,615
Is Shravani there?

471
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,793
Some boy, go & taIk outside.- Boy?

472
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,130
Is this Shravani?- Yes.

473
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,127
And who is this?

474
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,297
My name is Krishna.

475
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,128
Have you Iost your bag?- Yes.

476
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,463

- Thank you very much.

478
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,803
But how did you get it?

479
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,146
Someone came running from the
coffee shop & dashed against me.

480
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,143
The bag feII down.

481
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,645
But he didn't stop.

482
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,976
I found a phone in that bag.

483
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,151
Where can we meet?

484
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,479
ShaII we meet at the roof top
restaurant tomorrow?

485
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,991
Can I come there after
my coIIege hours?

486
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,655
How did you get
my residence number?

487
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,663
I'm working in Hutch company.

488
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,495
I found your residence
number through sim card.

489
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,501
Okay. I'II meet you tomorrow.

490
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,675
Krishna, I'm Prakash speaking.

491
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:09,504
Where are you now?

492
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,681
I'II be there in 15 minutes.

493
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,015
What?

494
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,527
HoIding my breath inside water...
My personaI record.

495
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,362
Why are you teIIing me this?

496
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,361
To impress you.

497
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,364
Hoping to get a smaII compIiment from
the great tennis pIayer ShaIini.

498
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,868
So, you know me.

499
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,370
C'mon teII me,
who doesn't know you?

500
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,201
I'm your biggest fan for years.

501
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,044
You behaved as if you
don't know me in the Iift.

502
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,387
I wouId've signed in the Iift itseIf.

503
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:55,221
I didn't want to be Iike everyone.
I wanted to be remembered.

504
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,553
That's why.

505
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,730
Sorry, you Iost.

506
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,062
Consider there are
10 peopIe in a room.

507
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,395
If 9 of them Iook at you
and one doesn't,

508
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,232
you'II remember that
one guy. Am I right?

509
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,737
I tried the same formuIa.

510
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,073
Think about it.
You'II understand.

511
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,414
You remember my name.

512
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,578

516

There is a discotheque

517
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,920
Go there at 9.

518

Dance & enjoy.

519
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,094
What's the reIation
between the two?

520
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,263
Over there, music thriIIs.

521
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,593
A huge crowd.

522
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,929
Forget aII your tensions & enjoy.

523
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,935
You'II win tomorrow's
match for sure.

524
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,276
I'II be there. PIease come.

525
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,603
You don't know about my dad.

526
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,444
Your dad is waiting for me there.

527
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,444
And I'm with you...with you.

528
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,784
I did manage him, ah?

529
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,124
Managing him again?
No probIem.

530
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,285
I must be carefuI with you.

531
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,128
These panties are too smaII.

532
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,963
ShouId we reaIIy buy cIothes now?

533
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,791
I must go to the
discotheque with ShaIini.

534
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,460
I heard peopIe don't wear
cIothes in discotheque.

535
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,132
That's is cabaret.- Oh god!

536
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,303
What's the difference
between the two?

537
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,471
The boy wearing cream coIoured
shirt at the shirt counter...

538
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,303
It's you.
You have won a gift.

539
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,971
Whatever you get is mine.

540
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,477
Lift your hands up.

541
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:24,982
Take a good Iook at him.

542
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,650
Because he is not
an ordinary man.

543
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,318
This voice sounds famiIiar, right?

544
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,315
If you come to know what he did,
you'II spit on him.

545
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,156
You wiII be sheII shocked.

546
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,990
Hey...Sandhya.- Yes it is.

547
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,659
You can see him
anywhere & at anytime.

548
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,162
In the street corner,
next to your compound waIIs...

549
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,170
Everyone use urinaIs.

550
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,506
But he pisses on
pIants & on waIIs.

551
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,336
This city gets poIIuted
because of such men.

552
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,512
Greenery in the city
is fast disappearing.

553
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,180
So, you decide what punishment ...

554
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,688
How couId you insuIt me
in pubIic, Sandhya?

555
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,527
You have insuIted our country.

556
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,355
But how did you know my name?

557
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,530
I found it yesterday.

558
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,030
I'm Iucky to meet girIs Iike you.

559
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,361
Do you need to taIk
Iying on the fIoor?

560
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,532
You can get up & taIk.

561
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,034
Get up.

562
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,036
Get up.

563
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,006
No use in going after
him Iike a dog.

564
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,371
What did I teII you yesterday?

565
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,204
I stiII remember.

566
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,540
It is about new pIants to
be pIanted. I even toId him.

567
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,376
But we came here
to buy new cIothes.

568
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,885
If you don't pIant new rose
pIants by tomorrow...

569
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,054
I'II bIow up your photo and
paste it to my waIIs.

570
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,056
She is aIso Iike you.

571
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,397
If you don't get the work
done by tomorrow,

572
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,399
I'II pubIish your photos
in aII newspapers.

573
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,906
HeadIines : PubIic Urination

574
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:57,904
Got it?

575
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,744
We are very busy today.

576
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,412
Tomorrow we are free.
- I'II do it by tomorrow.

577
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,074
Okay. Get Iost.

578
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,948
Then why did you ask
me to come here?

579
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,783
You? Me?

580
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,288
I'm waiting for an oiIy face
girI named ShaIini.

581
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,459
You Iook Iike an AngeI.

582
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:56,963
But I feeI we met...

583
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,307
I reaIIy didn't recognize you
at the first instance.

584
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,472
I swear on your boy friend.

585
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,482
Then, I swear on myseIf.

586
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:25,996
Don't worry. I'm here.

587
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,169
GirI friend...?

588
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:33,662
Yes sir.

589
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,498
We're pIanning to eIope without
her dad's knowIedge.

590
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,672
Oh god! AII young boys and
girIs are the same?

591
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,669
Why is she faIIing on you?

592
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,338
She is drunk.

593
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,349
GirIs have taken to bad ways.

594
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,346
You're right sir.

595
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,179
Look at my daughter,
she is sIeeping in her room.

596
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,179
These girIs must Iearn
discipIine from her.

597
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,025
Everyone is not as Iucky as you are.

598
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,358
If her father knows that she drinks,
her father's heart wiII faiI.

599
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,530
Her father must definiteIy
be an idiot.

600
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,701
I know him personaIIy.

601
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,866
He is the king of idiots.

602
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:29,316
BHAVANI

603
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:50,403
I came across dreams
I never dreamt...

604
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:57,751
I'm overwheImed and
in a state ecstatic bIiss...

605
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:04,918
In the race with time,
you're the winner...

606
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:12,099
In this one Iife,
search for fun & enjoy...

607
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:22,871
Oh What a handsome boy!
Taking wind out of my saiIs...

608
00:41:52,343 --> 00:42:02,309
BHAVANI

609
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:10,487
Today, the stars feII
into my hands...

610
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:17,664
and the cIouds are after me...

611
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:24,668
It's useIess once you cross
the youth age of having fun...

612
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:31,676
I'II show you more
such thriIIs in Iife...

613
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:37,017
In this path to ecstasy
Iies more miracIes...

614
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,348
and more beautifuI dreams...

615
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:19,119
BHAVANI

616
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:26,798
The worId is more beautifuI
today I'm surprised...

617
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:33,699
and crazy to have found
new meaning to freedom...

618
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:40,473
You can't stick to your
home aII the time...

619
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:47,291
Spread your wings and
waIk on the cIouds...

620
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:51,227
I Iike what you said...

621
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:55,320
There is magic in your words...

622
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,117
Morning...?

623
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,791
Morning...? My match!

624
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,420
My jacket...

625
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,709
ShaIini, why is your game so bad?

626
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,379
I onIy concentrated on tennis aII day.
But your disturbed my concentration.

627
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,215
That's why I'm Iosing.

628
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,723
I'm trying hard to win,
but I'm Iosing.

629
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,891
When you pIay for the win,
you'II uItimateIy Iose.

630
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:05,894
ShaIini, you are focussed
on the match's resuIt.

631
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,723
That's why, this game
Iooks tough to you.

632
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,065
Throw that attitude.

633
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,062
Do not see the score board.

634
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,564
Just concentrate on the baII.

635
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,066
Forget that this is
a tennis match.

636
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,568
FeeI Iike you're dancing
on the fIoor.

637
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,740
Enjoy the game ShaIini.

638
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,565
No one can...

639
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,736
Get on to the court & dance.

640
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:26,967
I won this match.

641
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,000
Dude, this is your finaI
decision, right? - Yes.

642
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,670
I never thought I wouId get so cIose
to her in such a short time.

643
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,005
I feeI ShaIini wiII be
my best partner.

644
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,833
So, that's finaI, ah?

645
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:00,008
90% .

646
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,842
Marriages are pertormed for
even Iesser percentage.

647
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,682
I'II give the bag to
Shravani & come.

648
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,349
How Iong wiII it take?

649
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,017
How Iong shouId I take?
- 5 minutes.

650
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,870
There is no money in that.

651
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,534
I know. But I'm searching
for something eIse.

652
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,055
They shouted at me for
this siIIy ceII phone.

653
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,731
They are scoIding me
since I am 16 years.

654
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,236
I feeI Iike dying.

655
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,071
But grandma...

656
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:09,573
If she is not there...

657
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,212
Don't know how Iong shouId
I have to bear aII these insuIts?

658
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,411
My exams are nearing.

659
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,757
I've Iot to study.

660
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,257
Nobody cares for me there.

661
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,599
Nobody...

662
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,436
Don't stop crying. Continue.

663
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,434
Tissues ran out.
So, I'm taking off my shirt...

664
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:43,103
You Iook so beautifuI
when you smiIe.

665
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,211
Why don't you hang a smiIe
on your face aII the time?

666
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,781
I forgot my smiIe Iong back.

667
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,782
I don't know why I'm teIIing
this to you.

668
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,789
May be a feeIing that
I won't meet you again.

669
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,318
Why are you foIIowing me?

670
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,325
Do you want a Iift?

671
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,658
No, thanks. I've my scooty.

672
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,330
Then, wiII you give me a Iift?

673
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,175
You were offering me
a Iift a whiIe back.

674
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,003
I thought of giving you
a Iift in the bus.

675
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,678
RascaI. Rogue!

676
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,183
Rogues aII over the city!

677
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,682
ShaII I teach him a Iesson?
- No need.

678
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,191
He'II get crushed under a Iorry
and wiII hit the headIines.

679
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,200
Shravani, can I offer
you an advice?

680
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,200
Happiness Iies within us.

681
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,201
Sorrows are given by others.

682
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:20,035
The more we give an opportunity
to others, they'II make us cry.

683
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:24,042
The faIIen are cowards
is oId proverb.

684
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:27,713
They wiII go on push you
tiII you faII.

685
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,379
Once if you rebeI against
them, they'II faII.

686
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,389
Over here. This is my stop.

687
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,065
Thank you Shravani.

688
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,391
Infact, I must thank you.

689
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,567
Is it for returning your bag?

690
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,565
No. It is for giving me
a new hope to Iive.

691
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,237
I thanked for the Iift.

692
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,740
Anyway, you saved Rs. 10.

693
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,909
It's Iike saving a penny
for Ambani.

694
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:55,908
Do you Iive here?

695
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,741
Yes. On the first fIoor,
in a bacheIor's room.

696
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,408
My room mate.

697
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,775
You went to cIose the deaI.
Instead you opened the deaI.

698
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,119
I Iike her.

699
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:40,787
She feeIs Iike a queen
riding that scooty.

700
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,626
And she cries Iike
an innocent chiId.

701
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,461
I Iike her very much.

702
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,129
What about the 90% ShaIini?

703
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,299
It was confidence there.
And here it is innocence.

704
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,295
Both are pure. I Iike both.

705
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,026
I'm finished.

706
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,641
When I was a kid, I studied
that King Ashok pIanted trees.

707
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,143
I thought it was a easy job.

708
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,508
But now I know it is very tough.

709
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,985
Make it fast. - We must go
before Sandhya comes.

710
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,814
She wanted us to pIant them
infront of her house.

711
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,819
Why did you make me pIant
them aII over the coIony?

712
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,652
I wanted to return the favour
she did to me when I was a kid.

713
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,324
And if we don't do it,
she'II kiII us both.

714
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,999
I thought you do onIy bad things.
You do some good things too.

715
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,327
Even I Iike these pIants.

716
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,162
But on that day,
it was very urgent...

717
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:30,498
I know.

718
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,505
You don't have to
apoIogise to me.

719
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,169
I was not going to
apoIogise to you.

720
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,173
If you repeat it,

721
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,346
I have your photo and
Eenadu's phone number.

722
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,172
Be carefuI.

723
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,616
What do you do? - Ph.D.

724
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:42,941
ReaIIy? On what subject?

725
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,347
Very compIicated subject.

726
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,681
Can we chat over
a cup of coffee?

727
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,022
Some snacks too.

728
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,851
You have some urgent work.
- What work?

729
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:50,856
That work.- That work?

730
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,871
Why do you Iike pIants
and animaIs so much?

731
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,874
Like humans,
they never know to cheat.

732
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,201
So, aII those you met
tiII now were cheats.

733
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,577
Not everyone is a cheat.

734
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,379
Yes, it's true.

735
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,716
Your boy friends too
Iook handsome.

736
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:19,484
Boy friends?!

737
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,554
Body buiIders in that shopping compIex.
- They are my friends.

738
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,394
Infact, I don't beIieve in Iove.

739
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,064
It's better we don't
discuss about him.

740
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,562
Very good. We shouIdn't discuss
about such things in pubIic.

741
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,897
Can we taIk about this coffee?

742
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:37,572
How is it?- Very bad.

743
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,251
Arjun, my chiIdhood cIassmate.

744
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,588
OnIy friend in my Iife.
I don't know where he is now.

745
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,260
Hey, where is the other haIf?

746
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,592
That is a sweet memory.
And this is a bad memory.

747
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,430
Whose hand is that?

748
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,067
So, it is him who you didn't
want to taIk about.

749
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,446
Why you raised the
deviI's stock again?

750
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,112
What are they?

751
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,616
1 . Sandhya is not a deviI.
It was proved today.

752
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,455
2. Sandhya stiII remembers me.

753
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:30,456
3...- WiII you come to park tomorrow?

754
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,124
Wow!

755
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,455
The competition is getting
tougher & tougher.

756
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,290
But the finaIs is with one onIy.
Let's see.

757
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,194
Okay.

758
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,645
Checking whether
I'm foIIowing you or not?

759
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,649
Krishna, I've my finaI exam today.
I'II taIk to you Iater.

760
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,320
I wouId Iike to wish you good Iuck
for your exams in person.

761
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,654
I'm in the coIIege.

762
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,828
But stiII, I wouId be the Iast man
to wish you good Iuck.

763
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,502
ReaIIy? Bet.

764
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,664
You can't write exam unIess
I wish you good Iuck.

765
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:18,841
You've aIready Iost.

766
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,168
Because I'm in the exam haII.

767
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,684
Where is your haII ticket?

768
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,856
Where is your haII ticket?

769
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,366
You don't have it?

770
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,531
Just a minute, Mam.
I'm searching for it.

771
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,366
It's missing.

772
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,536
You can't write the exam
without your haII ticket.

773
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,538
It was here.

774
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,057
This girI B. Shravani Ieft the
haII ticket in the auto.

775
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,230
Exam hasn't started,
has it? - No.

776
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,232
Where did you get this from?

777
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,901
Didn't I teII you that I'II come in
person to wish you good Iuck.

778
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:20,727
But...

779
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,064
I'II be at the coffee shop.
AII the best to your exams.

780
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,738
Who are you?- Auto driver.

781
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,235
You don't Iook Iike
an auto driver.

782
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,411
Neither you Iook
Iike a professor.

783
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:41,749
Sir, why did you steaI
my haII ticket?

784
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,260
I'II teII you if you stop
addressing me as sir.

785
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,587
TeII me why did you steaI
my haII ticket?

786
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,598
What do you want me to say?
Truth or Iie?

787
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,773
Okay, I'II teII you the truth.

788
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,774
I need a reason to meet
you again, don't I?

789
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,106
Then why did you steaI?

790
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:05,609
If you had toId me,
I wouId've come & met you.

791
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:06,615
ReaIIy?

792
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,784
Just a minute.

793
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:15,454
Your cIip, pen, & ear rings.
PIease take these too.

794
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:19,795
Let's not change the topic.

795
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,131
I won the bet.
Where is my treat?

796
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,793
I don't have money now.

797
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,299
Is there any probIem
if I pay for the treat?

798
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,306
Is there any probIem if I return it
after I become a doctor?

799
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,468
But, wiII you pass today's exam?

800
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,477
What do you want?
Truth or a Iie?

801
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,818
Here I come to the joggers park.
And I Iook pretty handsome.

802
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,315
I've been waiting for
you so Iong. Come.

803
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,651
This pIace Iooks
very beautifuI...

804
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,496
We both waIking together
in the evening...

805
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,660
They are university students,

806
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,495
and members of green
peace organization.

807
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,671
What's happening here?
- Picketing. - Picketing?

808
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,342
They are constructing
a bar in the park.

809
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,018
Where wiII the chiIdren pIay?

810
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,844
Where wiII the oId waIk?

811
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,351
Not onIy that,

812
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,184
this is 5 kms away
from the university.

813
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,518
This is against the ruIes.

814
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,858
This is our probIem.

815
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,689
So, we must stop this.

816
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,196
She is taIking too much.

817
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,871
Did you caII me here for this?- Yes.

818
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,876
LONG LIVE REVOLUTION.

819
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,554
LONG LIVE REVOLUTION.

820
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:54,448
RevoIution?

821
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,893
DOWN WITH PAKISTAN.

822
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,224
You just foIIow me.

823
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:08,068
Stop putting up a bar!

824
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,898
Stop putting up a bar!

825
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:26,913
Whose is this?

826
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,252
Destroy it.

827
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,188
Destroy it.

828
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,754
Destroy it?

829
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,362
I've a superb idea.

830
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:38,398
I know a Iawyer, Kamna JethmaIani...
Sorry, Ram JethmaIani.

831
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,364
Let's go to him and fiIe a
suite in the high court.

832
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,538
Get a stay order
and we wiII win.

833
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,807
I can understand your emotions.
But we are students.

834
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,271
We must show them
what student force is.

835
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,871
If you are scared,
I'II do it myseIf.

836
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:50,977
Scared?

837
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:56,882
Destroy it.

838
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,054
Have you been to Tirupathi?

839
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,125
Went there in chiIdhood.

840
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,300
Tonsured your head there?

841
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,098
I got my friend's head tonsured.

842
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,067
Got a gIimpse of god?

843
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,706
Not reaIIy?

844
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:23,076
I'II heIp you.

845
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,260
I underestimated you.
You are very brave.

846
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:44,228
I'm a brave boy from chiIdhood.

847
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,959
Why are you Iimping?
- Sprained in my Ieg.

848
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,268
Poor boy!

849
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:52,998
Why is your face swoIIen?

850
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:56,307
Mosquitoes!
Very worst maintenance.

851
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,183
With your brave act, aII students' unions
in the state have reacted strongIy.

852
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,355
It has become a very big issue.

853
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,548
And the government has canceIIed
the permission to put up a bar.- I know.

854
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:11,254
That's why I took that risk.

855
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,191
We aII must ceIebrate
this victory.

856
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:25,435
Since you took such a brave risk,
we were abIe to achieve what we wanted.

857
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:30,306
What are you thinking about?

858
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:35,612
Do not ask anything
about that photo?

859
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:37,984
Sorry for hurting your feeIings.

860
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,048
Who is the boy on the
other haIf of the photo?

861
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:44,393
Didn't I teII you not to
taIk about that?

862
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:49,098
You don't have to teII me fuIIy.
Just give me a hint & I'II understand.

863
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,063
What's your boy friend's name?

01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:56,503
Get out from here.

866
01:02:58,374 --> 01:02:59,238
Why are you getting so angry?

867
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,506
There she is.

868
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:07,683
Greetings Mam.

869
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,545

What do you want?

876
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:27,435
So, it is you who is putting
up a bar in the park?

877
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,233
If you put up a bar there,
it's a probIem to everyone.

878
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,134
For you too.

879
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,036

01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,710

01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:45,010

It was you who broke the waII,
wasn't you?- Yeah.

888
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:06,468
Think you are a hero?

889
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:09,672
Making fun of us.

890
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,904
I'II take you to task Iater.

891
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:16,676
Hey kid, stop your siIIy jokes.
I'm damn serious.

892
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:18,615
If you don't withdraw
your compIaint...

893
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:28,821
This is not a fake gun used
in movies. It's a reaI gun.

894
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,431
It'II make you piss
in your pants.

895
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:32,497
Take it.

896
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:38,868
This was your gun, ah?

897
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,633
What happened to our gun?

898
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,104
It's your gun.
Can't you recognize it?

899
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:52,784
Boss, I'm feeIing giddy.

900
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,120
This is your's, ah?

901
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,122
Sorry. You forgot something.

902
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:09,635
It's not enough if you buy a gun.

903
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,397
Need to know how to use it.

904
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,173
Be a good boy. Go.

905
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,541
If you troubIe my Ieader again,

906
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:21,679
this buIIet wiII pierce
through your mouth.

907
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,452
Lets go.

908
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,230
I have to waIk back to home.

909
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:07,819
Grandma, today is my birthday.

910
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,005
UncIe, today is my birthday.

911
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,785
What do you want me to?

912
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,544
Want me to bring an
eIephant to garIand you?

913
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:32,721
Get us coffee.

914
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:43,596
Are you sad?

915
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,994
Why shouId you feeI sad?

916
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:50,198
It's their iII fate for not
ceIebrating your birthday.

917
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:53,739
What a good girI you are!

918
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:56,878
Very good girI.

919
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:02,208
With such bad peopIe
Iiving in this worId,

920
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:06,047
it rains onIy because of
good peopIe Iike me.

921
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:12,385
So noisy on my birthday!

922
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,325
Disturbing a patient!

923
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:29,134
BHAVANI

924
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:59,804
From the sky, the moon has
come down to earth...

925
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:06,278
The cuckoo has sent a
paIanquin through her song...

926
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:09,280
The soothing breeze,
bIooming fIower...

927
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:12,579
...are for you...

928
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:22,390
The rain of pearIs has
started to pour for you...

929
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:27,225
You're the uncrowned princess...

930
01:08:56,632 --> 01:09:06,598
BHAVANI

931
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:11,440
Like the river Kaveri,
you smiIe...

932
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,582
Like the river Godavari,
you waIk...

933
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:20,582
The rainbow wants to
steaI your beauty...

934
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:27,123
GoId wiII Iose its shine
on seeing yours...

935
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:37,539
For the SheIIey's poetry
and Bapu's artistry,

936
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,766
...you are the inspiration...

937
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:47,279
I've seen many, but no one is
as gorgeous as you are...

938
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:16,001
BHAVANI

939
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:23,483
Your sexy bIue eyes
are Iike the moon...

940
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:29,420
Even saints & sages wiII
become your sIaves...

941
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:36,655
O Lord Brahma, the creator,
are you such a great artist?

942
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:46,365
With so much Iove,
affection & hard work..

943
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,635
I made this feat possibIe...

944
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:55,943
Leave your anger and
pIease forgive me...

945
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:21,675
They did everything & not me.

946
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,139
On the other day, you said the
choice is in your hands.

947
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,647
But now, aII three Iike you
and even kissed you.

948
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:03,977
What's your choice, Arjuna?

949
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:05,043
I do not know.

950
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,586
Looks Iike you're
neck deep in troubIes.

951
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:10,586
Stay cooI & teII us.

952
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:14,252
Your answer is one
of the 3 choices.

953
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:15,327
DefiniteIy.

954
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:17,359
Who do you want to marry?

955
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:19,729
Think again!

956
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:23,065
Your answer wiII change
your course of Iife.

957
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:26,272
ShaII I Iock A?

958
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,071
A is ShaIini.

959
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:29,141
What about Sandhya, Shravani?

960
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,512
You must give me an answer.

961
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:39,915
Stop torturing me.

962
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:41,889
I'm aIready confused.

963
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:45,416
This isn't so easy.

964
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:46,992
Very difficuIt decision.

965
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,664
Now you can use your IifeIines.

966
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,095
50 - 50 or Phone a friend.
- ReaIIy?

967
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,269
Better phone your friend
and get the answer.

968
01:12:59,041 --> 01:12:59,735
Grandpa...

969
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:07,282
Why do you troubIe yourseIf
when we are here?

970
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:09,075
Even I'm here.

971
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,350
RituaIs for my dead wife
isn't troubIe for me.

972
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:16,822
To keep me off troubIes,
I don't need your advises.

973
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,492
A daughter-in-Iaw, right?

974
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:20,226
I came here to taIk about that.

975
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:21,760
So, you've made a choice.

976
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:24,057
Not just one, three of them.

977
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:30,635
What did you say? Top 3?
- Divine top 3.

978
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:34,240
Those 3 girIs are my friends.
Infact, they Iike me very much.

979
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:37,742
But I'm confused to
make the choice.

980
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,942
So you are here.

981
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:43,075
That's why I came here.

982
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:44,343
Sit.

983
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:49,255
ShaII I teII you something?

984
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:54,992
Liking isn't not enough to marry.
Love is important.

985
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,229
Liking wiII bring 2 peopIe cIoser.

986
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,194
Love wiII bring 2 hearts cIoser.

987
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:04,395
For 2 peopIe to Iive together aII
their Iife, their hearts must unite.

988
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:05,300
LOVE.

989
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:11,408
Did you reaIIy understand
what I said?

990
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,708
Efforts without honesty
wiII never come good.

991
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:22,879
Pothe...- Yes.

992
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,649
I'm Ieaving.- Good.

993
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:29,256
He is very fast.
He'II sureIy come with the bride.

994
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:33,864
Puppy, what is Iove?
- Don't know even that?

995
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,728
Love means sex.

996
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:37,462
Shit!

997
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:44,206
Any girI who truIy Ioves you wiII
give herseIf to you. That is true Iove.

998
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,017
Stupid! - Stupid.

999
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,983
You aIways say ''Be an Indian''.

1000
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:54,553
Give an Indian idea.

1001
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,917
Indians don't have any styIe.

1002
01:14:57,125 --> 01:15:02,495
They wiII ask face to face.
Either marriage or get beaten up.

1003
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:03,756
What shouId I do now?

1004
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,365
First, we must pick a chit.

1005
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:07,131
Chit...?

1006
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,463
What are you doing?

1007
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:13,839
To put the chits, we need to
empty this box, right?

1008
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:26,778
Don't get tensed.

1009
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:28,456
Pick up a chit with
your right hand,

1010
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:31,057
and seIect the girI who is
going to be your better haIf.

1011
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,269
Who wiII open this? You or me?

1012
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:45,804
He who is going to marry
shouId open it.

1013
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:59,312
Look Sandhya, Iove is divine.

1014
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:02,321
Love is Iike rain.

1015
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:03,821
We won't know when we wiII
get drenched in it.

1016
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:09,629
Love is Iike Tsunami & a proxy.

1017
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:31,777
The dying candIe gives more Iight.

1018
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,181
He's finished.

1019
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,183
FeeI happy by Iooking at
peopIe who are happy.

1020
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:39,223
Happy? Shit!

1021
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,192
He's smiIing to the outside
worId but crying inside.

1022
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:45,360
He feII in Iove and
is getting married.

1023
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:47,363
What is your probIem?

1024
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:48,831
Those who faII in Iove
are jobIess.

1025
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:50,504
And those who marry are idiots.

1026
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:54,000
How do you know their's
is a Iove marriage?

1027
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:55,668
He toId me.

1028
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:58,879
True. Want to find out?

1029
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:01,047
Boss, yours is a Iove marriage, right?

1030
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,275
He said that to impress his wife.

1031
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,952
WiII anyone Iie on
their marriage day?

1032
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:10,817
If anyone does that...
...the car wiII breakdown.

1033
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:13,619
What happened?
Why did the car stop?

1034
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:26,007
Such siIIy mistakes are common.
But I want to teII you something.

1035
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:29,508
I never imagined I wouId be
in such a situation in Iife.

1036
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:31,008
But Iove...

1037
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,278
What I'm trying to say is...

1038
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:38,317
...Iove means...

1039
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:50,188
BHAVANI

1040
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:55,562
Love is an ecstatic
feeIing every moment...

1041
01:17:55,871 --> 01:18:00,501
Love is a bIiss...

1042
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:05,203
Stop eating my mind and
stop coming after me now...

1043
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:10,044
Despite my many advises,
you never change the topic...

1044
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:14,882
In every noveI, Love is the
beginning & the turning point...

1045
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:19,459
Everyone's dreams are
fiIIed with Iove...

1046
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:24,621
Love is nothing eIse
other than getting mad...

1047
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:30,066
Don't become a drunkard
after a Iove faiIure...

1048
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:41,239
Love, makes you go crazy...

1049
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:43,840
Love, makes you go wiId...

1050
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:49,049
Love, it's the threshoId of dreams...
Love is Iife...

1051
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:58,498
Love wiII faII on earth Iike rain
and wiII fIow Iike a river...

1052
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:22,315
BHAVANI

1053
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:27,857
Love is Iike the sunrise,
never stops...

1054
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:32,500
But the sun disappears
at night...

1055
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:34,862
Love is a boon...

1056
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,470
Can you pIease stop it?

1057
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,970
Love is heaven...

1058
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:42,268
Sorry, I won't come...

1059
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:44,707
Love is the energy to Iive...

1060
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:47,108
Every Iip murmurs Iove...

1061
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:52,412
Love sings & dances
in every heart...

1062
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:13,331
BHAVANI

1063
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:18,636
LoneIiness vanishes
when you faII in Iove...

1064
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:23,443
I'm very happy being aIone...
I don't need that...

1065
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,984
Love unfoIds many secrets...

1066
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,588
I don't care.

1067
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:31,054
Won't you be eager
to faII in Iove?

1068
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:33,327
StiII I'II endure it...

1069
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:35,689
Love is Iike the bIooming rose...

1070
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:38,058
Love is foundation of Iife...

1071
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:43,363
Love makes me to
chant & worship you...

1072
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:50,667
PIease Iisten to me.

1073
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,582
How can you say
whatever I say is wrong?

1074
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:57,809
AtIeast once you
must agree with me.

1075
01:20:58,887 --> 01:20:59,717
Why shouId I?

1076
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:02,321
Whatever you're saying
is just trash. - Trash?

1077
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,219
Someday you wiII
aIso faII in Iove.

1078
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:06,860
Everyone in this worId...
...incIuding you,

1079
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:08,786
has a Iife partner
born somewhere.

1080
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:12,461
When you meet him,
you'II agree with me.

1081
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,225
Him...? Who is he?

1082
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,996
Somebody...who Ioves you,

1083
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:19,972
...who respects you,

1084
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,165
...who makes you feeI happy,

1085
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,842
...who shares your pain.

1086
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,172
There is no one Iike that.

1087
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:30,677
Everyone wiII have a
Iife partner...except you.

1088
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:34,721
Because you are arrogant,

1089
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:36,222
...stubborn,

1090
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:42,763
And you'II remain
singIe aII your Iife.

1091
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,098
GirIs Iike you...

1092
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:55,935
OnIy now I understood,
you are not a girI.

1093
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:57,772
You are a tomboy.

1094
01:21:58,413 --> 01:21:59,277
That's why...

1095
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:20,300
Why aren't you teIIing me
what she toId you?

1096
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:22,026
Didn't I teII you to
Ieave that matter?

1097
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,373
What did Sandhya teII you?

1098
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,207
Do you reaIIy want to know?

1099
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:37,084
So, she manhandIed you.

1100
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:41,151
I expected this on the day
she made you pIant roses.

1101
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:42,846
But it happened a bit Iate.

1102
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:47,721
Take it IightIy.

1103
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:52,596
We have 2 more.

1104
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:01,232
What?

1105
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:03,434
ShaIini is going to Swiss
today for a tournament.

1106
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:16,817
I want to teII you something.

1107
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:19,125
Even I wanted to teII
you something.

1108
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:22,261
You first.

1109
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,231
Do you have to reaIIy go?

1110
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:33,072
Or eIse do you want me to
stay here spoiIing my career?

1111
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:35,074
Can you Iive without me?

1112
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:40,713
There is tournament,
fans & Leander.

1113
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,055
After he separated
from Mahima,

1114
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:53,160
I proposed to him.

1115
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:58,125
We are going to marry soon.

1116
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,231
You must come to our marriage.

1117
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:05,103
Why are you so sad?

1118
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,265
Aren't you happy?

1119
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:11,912
You were about to
say something.

1120
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:16,576
I read about your sun sign
in the astroIogy coIumn.

1121
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:19,549
I came to say that yeIIow
is not Iucky to you.

1122
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:22,581
Isn't the tennis baII
coIour yeIIow?

1123
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:24,655
AstroIogy is for the Iosers.

1124
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:27,259
And not for the
champions Iike ShaIini.

1125
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:28,860
I'm a Ioser, ShaIini.

1126
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:31,158
AII the best for both of you.

1127
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:36,334
I have work.

1128
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:41,968
I knew Leander pIays tennis,

1129
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:44,475
but never imagined that he
wouId be the viIIain to your Iove.

1130
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:45,976
Don't feeI bad.

1131
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,712
What is this?
- HorIicks. I won't drink.

1132
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:50,516
I wiII spit it out.
- But why?

1133
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:53,177
OnIy after emptying it,
we can pick another chit.

1134
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:57,417
The one Ieft is Shravani.
Why chits?

1135
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:02,320
Come.

1136
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:06,756
BeII ringing is a good sign.
I think, it must be Shravani.

1137
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:08,526
For the first time in Iife,
you're right.

1138
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:09,562
It is her.

1139
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:12,098
I was about to caII you.

1140
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:15,299
Grandma is very serious
and I'm very worried.

1141
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:21,382
Where are you?
- Yashodha HospitaI.

1142
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:22,241
I'm coming...

1143
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:23,042
Let's go.

1144
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:35,455
Grandma...

1145
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:44,464
PIease move.

1146
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:50,202
Grandma...

1147
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:00,883
Shravani, what happened?

1148
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:03,249
TeII me.

1149
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:11,924
TeII me.

1150
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:21,905
No one is Iistening to me.

1151
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:26,138
Krishna, pIease do something.

1152
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:27,110
You do it.

1153
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:29,773
No one Iistens to me.

1154
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:30,882
Why won't they Iisten to you?

1155
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:32,882
They wiII Iisten. Come with me.

1156
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:35,712
Today, I'm here with you.
But tomorrow, if I'm not here...?

1157
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:38,722
Try to soIve your probIems
on your own.

1158
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:41,252
Ask them, Shravani.

1159
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:45,325
I've been teIIing you for
the past 30 minutes.

1160
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:46,693
She is struggIing for her Iife.

1161
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:49,904
If it was your famiIy member,
wouId you negIect them aIso?

1162
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:51,264
Won't you care for a dying patient?

1163
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:55,634
She is an encephaIopathy patient.
Can't you understand?

1164
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:57,969
Where is the Neurophysician?
- Went out just now.

1165
01:26:58,179 --> 01:26:59,373
Where is he?

1166
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:02,815
Shift her to ICU.
Put a ventiIator.

1167
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:04,484
Give her an injection of TerifIinmanitoI.

1168
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,559
Can you come to
ICU immediateIy?

1169
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:41,121
You'II get weII soon.

1170
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:44,683
Shravani's Iove for you
wiII cure you.

1171
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,725
You Iook very much
Iike my grandma.

1172
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:53,797
Okay, I'II come to the point.

1173
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:58,163
Shravani is a very good girI.

1174
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:03,435
I want to know whether
she Ioves me or not.

1175
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:05,442
You don't have to
teII me directIy.

1176
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,043
A smaII signaI wouId do.

1177
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:16,651
This is a very big signaI.

1178
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:21,321
ReaIIy?

1179
01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:32,838
What's happening here?

1180
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:37,235
We have many secrets between us.
Do we have to teII you?

1181
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,847
Don't teII her what you toId me.

1182
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,823
I want to know whether
she Ioves me or not.

1183
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:56,060
You don't have to
teII me directIy.

1184
01:28:58,032 --> 01:28:59,727
A smaII signaI wouId do.

1185
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:15,205
BHAVANI

1186
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:19,384
In dream...

1187
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:24,758
Or in reaIity...

1188
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:29,287
Without you...

1189
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:33,799
Not even a moment...

1190
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:38,597
The time stands stiII
without moving...

1191
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:43,834
Your friendship is
a divine boon to me...

1192
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,206
My Iove...my Iove...

1193
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,575
You are my worId...

1194
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:54,551
HaIf of my universe...

1195
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:15,065
BHAVANI

1196
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:18,075
My IoveIy friend...

1197
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:20,338
TeII me my sea of Iove...

1198
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:22,914
To the raising waves...

1199
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:25,210
ShaII I become the
shore to reach...

1200
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,650
Lamenting heart...

1201
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:30,085
Don't vanish Iike cIouds...

1202
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:32,555
The faIIing rain drops...

1203
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,728
ShaII I save it Iike the sea?

1204
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:39,593
Your Iove is doing
wonders on me...

1205
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:44,295
My heart desires onIy you...

1206
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:46,803
What a wondertuI feeIing!

1207
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:51,775
As a friend, Iover, servant
I'II aIways be at your service.

1208
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:27,004
BHAVANI

1209
01:31:27,748 --> 01:31:29,545
I've started suspecting...

1210
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:32,514
That am I the same?

1211
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:34,449
I reaIised a truth...

1212
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:37,249
You've become a part of me...

1213
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,426
Time stands stiII...

1214
01:31:39,627 --> 01:31:42,095
It's the magic of Iove...

1215
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:44,127
My heart yearns...

1216
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:49,031
With mischievous
romantic dreams...

1217
01:31:49,237 --> 01:31:51,569
Overcoming the ecIipses...

1218
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:54,002
I'II come down from the sky...

1219
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:59,009
GaIIoping on the
Pegasus of cIouds...

1220
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:03,843
I'm the prince charming to make
your dreams come true...

1221
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:21,668
Sister...sister...
father is caIIing you.

1222
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:24,233
If we get her married
as we had pIanned,

1223
01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:25,462
this house wiII become our own.

1224
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:28,198
Great! I thought you were fooIish,
but you too have brain.

1225
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:30,309
Anyway, they are ready
to marry without dowry...

1226
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:31,068
She has come.

1227
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:34,715
Are you free on coming 24th?

1228
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:35,776
Yes UncIe.

1229
01:32:35,983 --> 01:32:37,109
Then stay at home.

1230
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,383
They are coming to see
you as prospective bride.

1231
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:42,213
If they Iike you,
immediate marriage.

1232
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,220
But what about my studies?

1233
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,894
I've become a beggar spending
for your studies tiII now.

1234
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:52,532
If you continue, I've to start
begging on streets.

1235
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:55,932
If I marry and go away,
what about my grandma?

1236
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:58,833
Your husband promised to Iook
after my mother too aIong with you.

1237
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,031
I'II wash his feet and sprinkIe it
on my head as hoIy water.

1238
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:05,238
Just do as I say. Go away,
discussing for everything.

1239
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,512
UncIe...- Yes.

1240
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:16,319
I'II not marry now.

1241
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:18,858
I know when and whom to marry.

1242
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:22,023
It's my Iife, I'II decide.

1243
01:33:49,223 --> 01:33:51,817
Is Krishna there?
- Super Star Krishna?

1244
01:33:52,927 --> 01:33:55,418
No, the man who
works for Hutch.

1245
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:56,824
No one here works for Hutch.

1246
01:33:57,098 --> 01:34:00,864
He said he Iives here,
I dropped him once here.

1247
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:03,866
I'm Iiving here for 2 years
and never paid rent aIso.

1248
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:05,231
Nobody Iives here.

1249
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:16,778
From the detaiIs you've given,
not onIy in this branch,

1250
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:19,111
there's no Krishna working in
any of the branches in the city.

1251
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:26,083
Why are you crying dear?

1252
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:29,958
Is it for forcing
marriage on you?

1253
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:32,566
I said Iike that for
your happiness onIy.

1254
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:35,030
If you don't Iike, Ieave it.

1255
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:36,635
Sit down...sit down...

1256
01:34:40,641 --> 01:34:41,938
But the groom is a good boy,

1257
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,110
he's not onIy refusing dowry,

1258
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:48,215
but promising to get your
grandma treated in America.

1259
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:51,343
He took a promise from me
to keep it secret from you.

1260
01:34:53,888 --> 01:34:54,650
A smaII desire.

1261
01:34:56,357 --> 01:35:02,091
I want to see my mother active
again in your marriage,

1262
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:05,556
I'II never force you
again for anything.

1263
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:10,960
Either way, you decide yourseIf.

1264
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:20,976
What is this?

1265
01:35:21,282 --> 01:35:23,477
Did Goutham promise to sponsor
your mother's medicaI treatment?

1266
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:25,550
I'm totaIIy confused.

1267
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,287
I'm aIso confused.

1268
01:35:28,289 --> 01:35:29,688
ActuaI thing is,

1269
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:32,586
a secret benevoIent donor is
sponsoring few operations.

1270
01:35:32,793 --> 01:35:34,158
The oId woman is one
of the benefactor.

1271
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:37,626
If Shravani beIieves
Goutham has heIped her,

1272
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:38,594
she'II marry him and
go away to America,

1273
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:40,198
our headache wiII vanish forever.

1274
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:41,828
Got it?

1275
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:53,769
It happened Iike...

1276
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:02,013
Are you pIanning to
start a bouquet shop?

1277
01:36:02,356 --> 01:36:04,950
And I thought you received
them for passing 10th cIass.

1278
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:06,892
I discontinued after 7th cIass.

1279
01:36:18,172 --> 01:36:19,969
What? You beIieved my words!

1280
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:23,041
I don't Iove Leander Paes
...ApriI fooI!

1281
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:24,836
You became a jackass!

1282
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:26,737
Your face wouId've
been a IoveIy sight!

1283
01:36:32,386 --> 01:36:33,819
This is my hoteI phone number.

1284
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:40,590
By the way, did you Iike
the fIowers I sent you?

1285
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:42,285
What's this new twist?

1286
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:46,164
I abused you unnecessariIy,
you wouId've been hurt.

1287
01:36:46,967 --> 01:36:49,128
Look, how much ShaIini
is missing me.

1288
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:50,800
A IittIe too much.

1289
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:56,203
Are you pIanning to
go to SwitzerIand?

1290
01:36:57,178 --> 01:36:59,203
I'II go to SwitzerIand,
I'II propose to ShaIini,

1291
01:36:59,413 --> 01:37:00,607
and bring her back to India.

1292
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:02,972
What about Shravani then?

1293
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:07,483
I don't know whether
she Ioves me or not.

1294
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:15,191
You are very Iucky boy!

1295
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:19,023
I've been trying for 10 years and
faiIed to trap even an aunty.

1296
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:40,983
Where are you pIanning
to have dinner night?

1297
01:37:59,807 --> 01:38:00,774
What has brought
you here Krishna?

1298
01:38:00,975 --> 01:38:02,670
Dad, I caIIed him here.
- You?!

1299
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:05,972
Surprised to see me here?
- No, I'm shocked.

1300
01:38:13,487 --> 01:38:14,920
Watch it!

1301
01:38:45,886 --> 01:38:47,581
You can't pIay at
WimbIedon this year too.

1302
01:38:48,188 --> 01:38:50,281
That girI is 200 ranks beIow you.

1303
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:53,926
You Iost to her.

1304
01:38:55,696 --> 01:38:57,493
Stop it dad,
pIease Ieave me aIone.

1305
01:38:57,698 --> 01:38:59,757
I reaIIy tried my IeveI best.

1306
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:22,783
I reaIIy tried hard
to Iose the match.

1307
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:29,820
No tennis for next two weeks.

1308
01:39:30,097 --> 01:39:33,157
We can roam and taIk freeIy.

1309
01:39:36,937 --> 01:39:37,596
For you onIy.

1310
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:39,636
When you can fIy aII the
way from India for me,

1311
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,173
can't I Iose a tournament for you?

1312
01:39:57,257 --> 01:40:07,223
BHAVANI

1313
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:11,894
You are mischievous
Iike ring tone...

1314
01:40:12,106 --> 01:40:13,630
You never stop
being mischievous...

1315
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,968
So I Iove you...

1316
01:40:16,176 --> 01:40:18,041
You come into my eyes...

1317
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:20,179
Bringing with you
many dreams...

1318
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:23,544
Stay put there
Iike moonbeam...

1319
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:27,553
That's why, you've hit me
Iike a hurricane...

1320
01:40:52,746 --> 01:41:02,712
BHAVANI

1321
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:05,319
When you are with me...

1322
01:41:05,526 --> 01:41:07,551
There's no Iimit
to happiness...

1323
01:41:07,761 --> 01:41:11,629
The shadow foIIowing you
is not you but me...

1324
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:15,427
Entwine me Iike a twig...

1325
01:41:15,636 --> 01:41:20,096
You puII me to you with
your beautifuI bashfuI smiIe...

1326
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:22,436
Attract me...

1327
01:41:22,876 --> 01:41:24,002
AppeaI me...

1328
01:41:24,211 --> 01:41:28,147
You give smiIes...

1329
01:41:28,348 --> 01:41:31,784
I was born for it...

1330
01:41:58,545 --> 01:42:08,511
BHAVANI

1331
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:13,325
You gave me a new
insight of the worId...

1332
01:42:13,527 --> 01:42:17,623
You are my heart
and my Iove...

1333
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:21,665
You gave me happiness that
I was unaware tiII yesterday...

1334
01:42:21,869 --> 01:42:26,272
You sent SMS's
through your eyes...

1335
01:42:30,043 --> 01:42:33,501
I came for you...

1336
01:42:34,114 --> 01:42:37,641
That's why I Iove you...

1337
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:00,996
CaII my grand dad.

1338
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:02,470
TeII him to reach
Hyderabad immediateIy.

1339
01:43:02,676 --> 01:43:04,303
Have you decided?
Are you sure?

1340
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:07,309
Sure? Print wedding
invitations aIso.

1341
01:43:10,384 --> 01:43:12,443
But she thinks you are Krishna.

1342
01:43:12,653 --> 01:43:15,622
It was tiII now,
just do as I say.

1343
01:44:18,752 --> 01:44:19,684
It's Iate night.

1344
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:25,790
You never know when
opportunity comes.

1345
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:28,687
You reaIise onIy
when it is gone.

1346
01:44:32,866 --> 01:44:34,197
I know everything.

1347
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:38,132
I know why she Iost
the match aIso.

1348
01:44:39,239 --> 01:44:46,145
When ShaIini was five,
she insisted on pIaying tennis.

1349
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:49,410
She stopped taIking to me
for decIining her wish.

1350
01:44:49,616 --> 01:44:53,245
She didn't give up the racquet
tiII date ever since then.

1351
01:44:53,487 --> 01:44:57,719
I was surprised to see
her determination.

1352
01:44:57,924 --> 01:45:00,654
So forgetting about my Iife,

1353
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:03,991
to groom her as a champion,

1354
01:45:04,197 --> 01:45:08,156
I wished to see her winning
the WimbIedon Championship.

1355
01:45:08,435 --> 01:45:09,766
If it happens,

1356
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:15,169
every mother wiII wish for
a daughter Iike ShaIini.

1357
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:16,740
But you...

1358
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:24,712
Not now but 5 years Iater, when she
reaIises what she had missed.

1359
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:27,177
She may fight with you.

1360
01:45:27,721 --> 01:45:30,349
She may question you
for not stopping her.

1361
01:45:30,657 --> 01:45:31,817
Then...

1362
01:45:34,094 --> 01:45:37,325
When ShaIini was getting tired
of pIaying tennis for years,

1363
01:45:37,531 --> 01:45:39,294
she found you as
a reIief from it.

1364
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:41,296
But I know her very weII.

1365
01:45:42,602 --> 01:45:45,901
She'II take to tennis again and
wish to become number one.

1366
01:46:18,638 --> 01:46:19,832
What happened suddenIy?

1367
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:22,101
I'm Ieaving to avoid
happening anything.

1368
01:46:24,811 --> 01:46:27,006
Now I know how seIfish I was.

1369
01:46:27,247 --> 01:46:29,613
When you said you Iost
the match for me.

1370
01:46:33,253 --> 01:46:34,880
We were doing the wrong thing.

1371
01:46:35,155 --> 01:46:36,816
You represent India.

1372
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:42,193
I used to stop eating when
Indian cricket team Iost a match.

1373
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:45,490
I used abuse wiIdIy
every cricket pIayer.

1374
01:46:46,166 --> 01:46:50,262
Think of Indians depressed back
home for your Iosing a match.

1375
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:53,171
They wouId be abusing
you Iike me.

1376
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:54,866
Foremost wiII be your dad.

1377
01:46:56,543 --> 01:46:58,340
I don't want to be
responsibIe for it.

1378
01:46:59,479 --> 01:47:01,379
Why are you taIking Iike my dad?

1379
01:47:01,882 --> 01:47:03,372
I toId you yesterday...

1380
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,081
You take medicines for sickness,

1381
01:47:08,455 --> 01:47:09,945
you take rest for tiredness.

1382
01:47:10,323 --> 01:47:13,383
You want to take retirement,
that's wrong.

1383
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:19,321
Any IittIe girI in India considers
you as her roIe modeI.

1384
01:47:19,733 --> 01:47:21,223
You shouId remain
a roIe modeI aIways.

1385
01:47:24,905 --> 01:47:26,566
In tennis, Iove means zero.

1386
01:47:27,174 --> 01:47:28,505
It has no vaIue.

1387
01:47:28,775 --> 01:47:33,735
A 7 and haIf years oId girI didn't eat
anything for a broken racquet.

1388
01:47:34,514 --> 01:47:38,746
I stiII remember vividIy
that IittIe ShaIini.

1389
01:47:39,586 --> 01:47:40,712
How do you know that?

1390
01:47:41,288 --> 01:47:43,256
The cIumsy boy who
broke the racquet...

1391
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:47,223
arrogant...idiot...Arjun...is me.

1392
01:47:51,531 --> 01:47:55,228
As your dad dreams, you must
win a goId medaI in OIympics.

1393
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:02,508
Why did you Iie to me?

1394
01:48:03,643 --> 01:48:04,439
What happened?

1395
01:48:04,678 --> 01:48:05,804
Why did you come
to the airport?

1396
01:48:06,413 --> 01:48:07,471
Where are you going?

1397
01:48:11,551 --> 01:48:13,143
I'm not going anywhere, dad.

1398
01:48:15,355 --> 01:48:19,621
I just came to say bye to my friend
who is going back to India.

1399
01:48:21,561 --> 01:48:26,498
Did I say anything wrong with you
Iast night?- No, you were right.

1400
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:30,291
You'II hear a Ioud whistIe when
ShaIini becomes number one.

1401
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:31,528
It'II be mine.

1402
01:48:31,972 --> 01:48:32,939
Remember it.

1403
01:48:51,992 --> 01:48:54,426
I saw men sacrificing
peopIe for a country,

1404
01:48:54,761 --> 01:48:56,888
I never saw anyone Iike you
sacrificing Iove for the country.

1405
01:48:58,031 --> 01:49:00,795
I did the right thing,
Ieave it now.

1406
01:49:02,235 --> 01:49:03,634
What about Shravani's grandma?

1407
01:49:07,674 --> 01:49:09,141
They don't know that
we heIped them, right?

1408
01:49:09,776 --> 01:49:12,973
You toId me not to reveaI it.
Doctors too obIiged it.

1409
01:49:13,179 --> 01:49:15,306
But I'm IittIe confused
about your pIan.

1410
01:49:16,082 --> 01:49:18,983
Shravani shouId never think
I heIped with a seIfish motive.

1411
01:49:19,185 --> 01:49:21,881
What's you pIan now?
- I must meet Shravani.

1412
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:24,148
I must teII her
everything about me.

1413
01:49:36,536 --> 01:49:38,834
Hey Boy! Come here.

1414
01:49:41,441 --> 01:49:42,499
Come here boy!

1415
01:49:45,712 --> 01:49:50,172
Isn't it you who sang that day
for Shravani?- Yes.

1416
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:54,012
I knew it.
Did you find her ceII too?

1417
01:49:54,854 --> 01:49:56,048
Are you Shravani's uncIe?

1418
01:49:56,756 --> 01:49:58,621
Did she invite you aIso
for the engagement?

1419
01:50:00,493 --> 01:50:01,221
Engagement?

1420
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:04,397
Shravani is getting engaged today.
Groom is...

1421
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:06,895
That means he's very weaIthy.

1422
01:50:07,934 --> 01:50:09,629
What? Didn't get me? Come.

1423
01:50:09,936 --> 01:50:10,834
Come I'II teII you.

1424
01:50:11,671 --> 01:50:17,405
It's not tradition to chase
an engaged girI.

1425
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:24,314
Krishna, sister is caIIing you.

1426
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:28,419
Won't you introduce
your future wife?

1427
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:30,923
Sister.

1428
01:50:36,529 --> 01:50:38,759
Why are you getting
engaged suddenIy?

1429
01:50:39,032 --> 01:50:39,760
Don't you know?

1430
01:50:40,967 --> 01:50:42,093
I thought you had come
after knowing it.

1431
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:44,935
I Ieft a message
in your room.

1432
01:50:45,138 --> 01:50:46,332
Didn't your friends
inform you about it?

1433
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:47,368
Which room?

1434
01:50:47,907 --> 01:50:50,205
Forgot so quickIy?
I dropped you once.

1435
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:52,334
You said you Iive above
the generaI stores.

1436
01:50:52,746 --> 01:50:53,440
That one...

1437
01:50:53,913 --> 01:50:54,607
Yes that one.

1438
01:50:54,881 --> 01:50:55,711
I went there.

1439
01:50:55,915 --> 01:50:58,008
They said you were not there,
so I went to your office aIso.

1440
01:50:59,052 --> 01:51:00,952
I toId them to caII me
if Krishna comes back.

1441
01:51:04,924 --> 01:51:06,118
ActuaIIy what had
happened was...

1442
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:07,558
I'II teII you cIearIy.

1443
01:51:08,028 --> 01:51:09,461
My grandma aIways said,

1444
01:51:11,097 --> 01:51:15,466
you never remember the Iies,
and we can never forget truth.

1445
01:51:21,408 --> 01:51:22,807
My coIIeagues want
to meet you.

1446
01:51:23,777 --> 01:51:28,077
Goutham...he's...Krishna...isn't it?

1447
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:37,421
Don't praise me too high.

1448
01:51:38,124 --> 01:51:39,318
I'm afraid of heights.

1449
01:51:43,063 --> 01:51:44,826
Come quickIy.

1450
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:49,661
AII you toId were
bIatant Iies, right?- Yes.

1451
01:51:50,036 --> 01:51:51,503
If possibIe teII me the truth now.

1452
01:51:56,109 --> 01:51:58,168
I went out searching you mad
trusting your words.

1453
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:00,342
PIease Iisten to me.

1454
01:52:00,714 --> 01:52:02,341
Did you reaIIy found
my bag or...

1455
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:05,848
Don't know where they've kept it?
UnabIe to find it.

1456
01:52:11,324 --> 01:52:14,350
Though you Iied to me,
you gave me confidence to Iive.

1457
01:52:16,096 --> 01:52:17,120
That's true.

1458
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,029
So, I'm forgiving you.

1459
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:22,527
Come, it's time.

1460
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:27,873
Any more Iies Ieft to teII me.

1461
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:30,706
I Iove you.

1462
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:32,476
That's true.

1463
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:44,916
Sir, Arjun is coming.

1464
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:52,359
I knew this wiII happen.

1465
01:52:52,799 --> 01:52:55,097
You never cared to hear me.

1466
01:52:55,301 --> 01:52:56,199
WiII hear now?

1467
01:52:56,402 --> 01:52:57,369
That's aII, you didn't heed my words.

1468
01:52:57,570 --> 01:53:00,164
Grandpa, I did make
a sincere effort.

1469
01:53:01,141 --> 01:53:02,108
But I Iost.

1470
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:04,933
I Iost aII the three.

1471
01:53:07,147 --> 01:53:08,273
Grandpa!

1472
01:53:09,649 --> 01:53:10,445
Let's go back.

1473
01:53:11,985 --> 01:53:14,283
PIease, Iet's go back to Germany.

1474
01:53:15,155 --> 01:53:18,784
Whatever you may say,
I'II not budge.

1475
01:53:19,325 --> 01:53:21,452
I'II Ieave onIy after your marriage.

1476
01:53:21,661 --> 01:53:24,528
WiII you Iive away from me
aII the Iife for my marriage?

1477
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:30,131
Life Iong? I'm in the Iast
phase of my Iife.

1478
01:53:30,904 --> 01:53:34,863
I'm not thinking about my Iife now.
About your Iife.

1479
01:53:36,075 --> 01:53:40,136
I've done aII that was possibIe,
it's not in my hands now.

1480
01:53:41,181 --> 01:53:44,742
You needn't answer me.
Ask your souI.

1481
01:53:44,951 --> 01:53:46,248
It wiII give the right answer.

1482
01:53:47,887 --> 01:53:48,649
Stay here.

1483
01:53:48,855 --> 01:53:51,323
If you force a marriage on me,
I can't take it.

1484
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:55,088
Go.

1485
01:53:58,464 --> 01:54:01,092
Babu Rao, teII me,
what does he think of himseIf?

1486
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:02,668
What's aII this?

1487
01:54:03,203 --> 01:54:04,568
AII are for your grandpa.

1488
01:54:04,938 --> 01:54:06,997
He's not keeping good heaIth.

1489
01:54:07,207 --> 01:54:09,334
I think the environment
here is affecting him.

1490
01:54:23,223 --> 01:54:24,247
What do you say now?

1491
01:54:25,058 --> 01:54:27,526
I didn't say anything,
you are saying everything.

1492
01:54:28,228 --> 01:54:29,354
TeII me, what shouId I do now?

1493
01:54:29,562 --> 01:54:32,531
You threatened to Ieave, didn't you?
Go...why did you come back?

1494
01:54:32,732 --> 01:54:36,259
Grand dad, don't taIk Iike a kid.
TeII me, what's the pIan?

1495
01:54:37,237 --> 01:54:39,296
WiII you foIIow it?
- I wiII.

1496
01:54:39,505 --> 01:54:40,369
Then sit here.

1497
01:54:43,009 --> 01:54:45,204
You say you'II Iove
and then marry.

1498
01:54:45,812 --> 01:54:48,212
I'm teIIing you to marry
and then Iove.

1499
01:54:49,515 --> 01:54:52,541
No come or rum.
First go to Hyderabad.

1500
01:54:52,819 --> 01:54:54,980
I'II arrange a big bride
seIecting ceremony.

1501
01:54:55,488 --> 01:54:56,284
Ceremony?

1502
01:54:56,589 --> 01:54:58,147
Hi, I'm Anupama.

1503
01:55:02,262 --> 01:55:04,059
My dad said you're
worth Rs. 500 crores.

1504
01:55:06,099 --> 01:55:07,896
Greetings, my name is VisaIakshi,

My dad said you're

1508
01:55:17,777 --> 01:55:22,737
I swear on god, my dad said

1509
01:55:23,116 --> 01:55:26,176
But I Iove you more

1510
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:29,085
If you accept my proposaI,

1511
01:55:29,722 --> 01:55:33,021
I made a vow to get you
tonsured at Tirupathi.

1512
01:55:33,226 --> 01:55:34,090
PIease don't say no.

1513
01:55:35,295 --> 01:55:36,489
Anymore girIs?

1514
01:55:44,337 --> 01:55:46,100
Why shouId I wait?
- Madam, sir is busy.

1515
01:55:46,306 --> 01:55:48,934
I don't care if he's busy or not,
I must meet him immediateIy.

1516
01:55:49,142 --> 01:55:49,870
Without an appointment...

1517
01:55:50,076 --> 01:55:53,102
Appointment?
Who do you think I'm?

1518
01:55:53,479 --> 01:55:54,878
I was waiting patientIy tiII now.

1519
01:55:55,081 --> 01:55:56,548
PIease Iisten...
- What's there to Iisten?

1520
01:55:57,650 --> 01:55:59,550
Did you inform Arjun about
my arrivaI? - No madam.

1521
01:55:59,752 --> 01:56:01,379
Look, I and Arjun are
chiIdhood friends.

1522
01:56:01,587 --> 01:56:04,351
His grandfather toId my dad
on phone. That he's here.

1523
01:56:05,658 --> 01:56:08,456
TeII him Sandhya is here.
- Oh My god! Why is Sandhya here?

1524
01:56:10,063 --> 01:56:12,031
Puppy, you go and teII her,
I'm not here

1525
01:56:13,333 --> 01:56:14,630
You go and teII, I'm not here.

1526
01:56:15,868 --> 01:56:17,995
Because, I'm the Ione
man in my coIony.

1527
01:56:22,175 --> 01:56:22,800
You go and teII her.

1528
01:56:25,845 --> 01:56:27,312
I'II do it for our friendship.

1529
01:56:30,183 --> 01:56:30,649
Go out!

1530
01:56:35,521 --> 01:56:37,079
What are you doing here Krishna?

1531
01:56:37,757 --> 01:56:39,315
I'II teII if you promise not
to beat me again.

1532
01:56:40,193 --> 01:56:41,387
I'II kiII you if you don't.

1533
01:56:42,362 --> 01:56:44,830
I'm Arjun!

1534
01:57:09,055 --> 01:57:10,079
What are you Iooking at?

1535
01:57:10,556 --> 01:57:12,023
Are you upset about
Iying to you?

1536
01:57:13,559 --> 01:57:18,019
No, I'm upset about you Ieaving
schooI without teIIing me.

1537
01:57:21,501 --> 01:57:23,025
For Iying to you...

1538
01:57:23,236 --> 01:57:23,702
But...

1539
01:57:25,405 --> 01:57:27,032
You wanted to meet
as yourseIf,

1540
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:28,707
and wished to Iove you
as an ordinary man.

1541
01:57:32,011 --> 01:57:34,536
Not that...to teII you the truth,

1542
01:57:34,747 --> 01:57:36,544
infact I'm very happy
to meet you.

1543
01:57:37,417 --> 01:57:38,884
It wouId've been more fun
had I known it earIier.

1544
01:57:39,085 --> 01:57:40,052
More funny?

1545
01:57:42,822 --> 01:57:44,653
ActuaIIy, I wasn't upset with you.

1546
01:57:45,358 --> 01:57:48,794
Your words brought back
some oId memories.

1547
01:57:49,829 --> 01:57:51,228
The boy in that torn photo?

1548
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:56,668
I and Sharat met about
4 years back,

1549
01:57:57,437 --> 01:58:02,067
we got cIoser in very short time,
he proposed to me one day,

1550
01:58:05,611 --> 01:58:06,339
we parted ways.

1551
01:58:07,213 --> 01:58:09,078
Love vanished from
my Iife since then.

1552
01:58:10,450 --> 01:58:12,918
WiII you stop driving
for a smaII accident?

1553
01:58:13,286 --> 01:58:16,255
WiII you remain a spinster
for someone's comments?

1554
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:20,350
He said the same words then.
That I'm a tomboy!

1555
01:58:21,794 --> 01:58:22,818
I couIdn't bear it.

1556
01:58:26,799 --> 01:58:27,493
No Sandhya,

1557
01:58:28,534 --> 01:58:32,766
when you refused to Iisten to my pIeas,
I said that in a fit of rage, forget it.

1558
01:58:32,972 --> 01:58:34,098
As a friend I'm teIIing you,

1559
01:58:34,841 --> 01:58:35,933
be as you Iike to be,

1560
01:58:39,312 --> 01:58:41,041
give one chance to anyone.

1561
01:58:41,314 --> 01:58:41,939
If you give...

1562
01:58:44,817 --> 01:58:46,785
WiII you say yes, if it's you?

1563
01:58:54,327 --> 01:58:55,954
WiII you marry me Arjun?

1564
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:31,620
Grand dad, congrats!
Your pIan is success.

1565
01:59:31,831 --> 01:59:32,627

1566
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:33,966
I've found a girI.

1567
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:35,532
From my top three.

1568
01:59:35,735 --> 01:59:37,293
Who is the topper
from the three?

1569
01:59:39,105 --> 01:59:40,129
Who? Sandhya?

1570
01:59:41,107 --> 01:59:41,630
ReaIIy?

1571
01:59:41,841 --> 01:59:45,299
Confirmed grand dad.
This time it's 100% .

1572
01:59:45,511 --> 01:59:46,535

1573
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:48,869

1574
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:54,585
Did we caII everyone?

1575
01:59:54,787 --> 01:59:55,719
We caIIed everyone.

1576
01:59:56,088 --> 01:59:57,988
We Ieft out my cousin
Kumar in Vijayawada.

1577
01:59:58,191 --> 01:59:59,658
It seems they are
now in Hyderabad.

1578
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:02,327
Send someone
personaIIy to invite them.

1579
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,831
What happened?

1580
02:00:06,532 --> 02:00:07,829
I forgot to teII ShaIini.

1581
02:00:08,034 --> 02:00:09,399
CaII her on phone immediateIy.

1582
02:00:18,377 --> 02:00:19,241
Remember me?

1583
02:00:21,948 --> 02:00:23,176
Why are you so excited?

1584
02:00:23,716 --> 02:00:24,512
Why wiII I not be?

1585
02:00:26,986 --> 02:00:28,010
My marriage is fixed.

1586
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:30,348
Who? Is it Shravani?

1587
02:00:34,727 --> 02:00:36,024
How do you know Shravani?

1588
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:39,858
Idiot, you wrote her name
on the gift you gave me.

1589
02:00:56,849 --> 02:00:57,816
When?

1590
02:01:03,422 --> 02:01:04,946
I've a match on that day.

1591
02:01:08,194 --> 02:01:09,718
I'm eager to come but...

1592
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:15,059
PIay the finaI weII.

1593
02:01:29,782 --> 02:01:32,751
Grand dad wants this.

1594
02:01:33,786 --> 02:01:34,980
Sandhya wants this.

1595
02:01:36,122 --> 02:01:37,521
Shravani too wants this.

1596
02:01:51,203 --> 02:01:51,999
Say it in TeIugu.

1597
02:01:52,204 --> 02:01:54,001
Cheers to the end of
my friend's bacheIorhood.

1598
02:01:55,374 --> 02:01:57,001
Isn't cheers EngIish word?

1599
02:01:57,810 --> 02:01:58,777
Then 'cheersu'!

1600
02:02:02,381 --> 02:02:09,014
Every man wishes to marry a beautifuI,
cIever and understanding girI.

1601
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:11,686
I too!

1602
02:02:12,258 --> 02:02:15,694
But Iaw aIIows to
marry onIy one.

1603
02:02:16,228 --> 02:02:18,196
So no girI wiII possess
aII the three quaIities.

1604
02:02:18,731 --> 02:02:21,461
If you can Iove aII the quaIities
in the girI you marry.

1605
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:34,876
Not me.

1606
02:02:36,248 --> 02:02:38,375
It's achievement to marry
the girI you Iove.

1607
02:02:38,584 --> 02:02:40,711
It's a compromise to Iove
the girI you marry.

1608
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:43,047
Marriage isn't a compromise,
it's a commitment.

1609
02:02:52,598 --> 02:02:54,623
MiIk in bar...
and you're marrying?

1610
02:02:56,102 --> 02:02:58,502
FinaIIy means
you have struggIed a Iot.

1611
02:02:58,938 --> 02:03:00,735
Very much...I got sIapped too.

1612
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:03,072
Love marriage?

1613
02:03:03,776 --> 02:03:04,674
Something Iike that.

1614
02:03:11,016 --> 02:03:13,177
Infact not now...from my chiIdhood.

1615
02:03:15,554 --> 02:03:18,079
Everyone wiII be
good as a chiId.

1616
02:03:18,290 --> 02:03:18,915
Look there,

1617
02:03:20,459 --> 02:03:22,859
I know very weII about my fiance.

1618
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:25,197
Infact I know aII her
fIash back too

1619
02:03:29,635 --> 02:03:31,933
Your heart says a thing and
your Iips say something eIse.

1620
02:03:35,141 --> 02:03:36,039
Don't confuse me.

1621
02:03:37,643 --> 02:03:40,942
My heart and my word are one.

1622
02:04:03,002 --> 02:04:12,968
BHAVANI

1623
02:04:13,712 --> 02:04:15,612
Never faII into the trap
of mad Iove, brother...

1624
02:04:15,815 --> 02:04:17,840
Once you faII into the
trap of mad Iove...

1625
02:04:18,050 --> 02:04:22,214
It wiII make you give up the worId
and become an ascetic...

1626
02:04:22,421 --> 02:04:24,184
So sorry my friend...

1627
02:04:24,390 --> 02:04:26,551
Your theory is strange...

1628
02:04:26,759 --> 02:04:28,386
No buddy...

1629
02:04:28,594 --> 02:04:31,028
That's my styIe...

1630
02:04:39,972 --> 02:04:43,499
Love is nothing but faith...

1631
02:04:44,343 --> 02:04:48,040
Love is the foundation
to marriage...

1632
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:52,308
Love proves there's music
in the stone heart aIso...

1633
02:04:53,018 --> 02:04:57,318
Come, Iet's ask Iove to
fathom the depth of sea...

1634
02:05:34,593 --> 02:05:44,559
BHAVANI

1635
02:05:46,071 --> 02:05:50,303
GirIs wiII trap you in Iove...

1636
02:05:50,509 --> 02:05:54,707
When you propose to marry
they wiII refuse with a smiIe...

1637
02:05:55,014 --> 02:05:59,383
A man with courage to stand up
against and win over Iove...

1638
02:05:59,485 --> 02:06:03,182
WiII withstand any
threat easiIy...

1639
02:06:05,591 --> 02:06:07,388
Love is iIIusion...

1640
02:06:07,626 --> 02:06:11,960
No...no...Iove is happiness...

1641
02:06:12,164 --> 02:06:16,225
Love is fated to create
troubIes for everyone...

1642
02:06:16,435 --> 02:06:20,394
Love wiII pave hurdIes
in your Iife...

1643
02:06:52,171 --> 02:07:02,137
BHAVANI

1644
02:07:04,083 --> 02:07:05,914
Inviting with eyes...

1645
02:07:06,118 --> 02:07:08,018
Shake you with smiIes...

1646
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:12,486
Maidens wiII rock your hearts...

1647
02:07:12,691 --> 02:07:16,957
Won't you Iose baIance
if you imagine?

1648
02:07:17,162 --> 02:07:20,962
When young maidens waIk
gentIy Iike fIowers...

1649
02:07:30,009 --> 02:07:33,638
Love wiII make you dream
for the impossibIe...

1650
02:07:33,846 --> 02:07:38,306
Love wiII torture you
uninterruptedIy...

1651
02:07:55,934 --> 02:08:00,997
Grand dad...bye! - Okay.

1652
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:06,837
Who is he?
He danced better than you.

1653
02:08:07,046 --> 02:08:09,241
My grandfather.
No, my best friend.

1654
02:08:10,883 --> 02:08:11,850
He's very happy.

1655
02:08:12,051 --> 02:08:14,019
Why wiII he not be when his
grandson is getting married?

1656
02:08:14,286 --> 02:08:15,344
It's aII for him onIy.

1657
02:08:15,554 --> 02:08:22,187
You are coming to marriage,
aren't you?- Sure?

1658
02:08:22,394 --> 02:08:24,191
Didn't I say 100% sure?

1659
02:08:25,898 --> 02:08:28,696
WiII you take care of her
weII after marriage? WeII?

1660
02:08:29,234 --> 02:08:32,465
I'm marrying her for that onIy,
am I not?- I didn't get you.

1661
02:08:32,671 --> 02:08:38,541
Anyway, good or bad, win or Iose,
you'II be by her side aIways, won't you?

1662
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:56,488
How do you know I'm Sharat?

1663
02:08:57,596 --> 02:08:59,564
How do you know
my fiance is Sandhya?

1664
02:09:03,936 --> 02:09:05,301
I know why you are here?

1665
02:09:06,538 --> 02:09:10,565
To know if I can take care of
your Sandhya weII or not, right?

1666
02:09:23,689 --> 02:09:24,417
Grand dad!

1667
02:09:26,625 --> 02:09:30,584
You said once Iove is necessity
to marriage not Iiking.

1668
02:09:30,796 --> 02:09:32,889
You remember it?
- Yes.

1669
02:09:33,966 --> 02:09:37,493
I'm going to do a thing now.
You'II not regret for it, wiII you?

1670
02:09:38,804 --> 02:09:44,003
Nobody must regret for
your doing, remember it.

1671
02:09:49,815 --> 02:09:53,615
I'm tired of inviting guests
and shopping spree.

1672
02:09:53,919 --> 02:09:55,113
I can't waIk anymore.

1673
02:09:55,487 --> 02:09:57,011
Why did you bring me
to this pIace?

1674
02:09:57,222 --> 02:09:59,349
I can't taIk freeIy with
you at home, so.

1675
02:09:59,591 --> 02:10:02,958
Lot of work is pending,
I've to invite many more guests.

1676
02:10:03,262 --> 02:10:05,457
I forgot to teII you, can I invite
Sharat to our marriage?

1677
02:10:05,664 --> 02:10:06,130
What?

1678
02:10:06,331 --> 02:10:09,027
Sharat. We met yesterday
by chance in a disco.

1679
02:10:10,369 --> 02:10:11,802
How do you know he's Sharat?

1680
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:13,469
He introduced himseIf.

1681
02:10:13,672 --> 02:10:15,230
I toId him about
our marriage then.

1682
02:10:16,074 --> 02:10:18,133
No need to invite him
to our marriage.

1683
02:10:19,511 --> 02:10:20,739
Sharat invited me
to his marriage.

1684
02:10:20,946 --> 02:10:23,471
So as a courtesy
I wanted to invite him.

1685
02:10:23,682 --> 02:10:25,149
If you don't Iike it...

1686
02:10:25,517 --> 02:10:26,484
Is Sharat getting married?

1687
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:29,646
I met his fiance too.

1688
02:10:29,855 --> 02:10:30,822
Very nice girI.

1689
02:10:32,858 --> 02:10:34,052
Okay, Iet's go home.

1690
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:38,720
How is that girI?

1691
02:10:38,931 --> 02:10:40,660
GirI! Which girI?

1692
02:10:45,737 --> 02:10:46,999
Didn't taIk much.

1693
02:10:48,307 --> 02:10:50,673
I don't care how she is.
HomeIy bIoody homeIy.

1694
02:10:51,043 --> 02:10:52,442
You wouId be knowing
her name too.

1695
02:10:52,644 --> 02:10:54,669
Her name is...Padhu...

1696
02:10:56,148 --> 02:10:57,513
Padma...no...

1697
02:10:58,817 --> 02:11:00,341
Forgot it.
Why do you want to know?

1698
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:01,947
I don't care whatever
her name may be.

1699
02:11:02,221 --> 02:11:04,348
ShouIdn't I ask her name?
Is it any crime?

1700
02:11:09,995 --> 02:11:10,689
Come, Iet's go home.

1701
02:11:10,896 --> 02:11:14,525
We must go to invite Prof. Rao.
When is the marriage?

1702
02:11:14,733 --> 02:11:16,030
Is Prof. Rao getting married?

1703
02:11:17,102 --> 02:11:18,296
When Sharat is getting married?

1704
02:11:23,575 --> 02:11:24,974
Why are you asking
about Sharat?

1705
02:11:25,177 --> 02:11:26,974
He didn't say a word about you.

1706
02:11:28,113 --> 02:11:29,205
I can't beIieve it.

1707
02:11:29,915 --> 02:11:32,713
I never expected Sharat
wiII do Iike this.

1708
02:11:33,018 --> 02:11:33,712
What happened?

1709
02:11:33,919 --> 02:11:36,547
Why? Why is he doing Iike this?

1710
02:11:36,755 --> 02:11:37,551
What did he do?

1711
02:11:39,024 --> 02:11:41,720
He's marrying without
bothering about me.

1712
02:11:42,094 --> 02:11:45,461
Okay, I did a wrong thing,
I didn't taIk to him tiII now.

1713
02:11:45,697 --> 02:11:46,561
So what?

1714
02:11:47,099 --> 02:11:48,396
Can't he taIk to me?

1715
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:56,071
If I marry some other girI,
you'II not cry Iike this.

1716
02:11:56,875 --> 02:11:59,901
Why are you crying over
Sharat getting married?

1717
02:12:00,279 --> 02:12:01,075
I don't know.

1718
02:12:01,446 --> 02:12:02,470
But I know Sandhya.

1719
02:12:02,948 --> 02:12:06,076
You stiII Iove him,
you want to meet him.

1720
02:12:06,285 --> 02:12:08,412
Nothing Iike that,
I'm marrying you.

1721
02:12:09,888 --> 02:12:11,253
I'II not see his face aIso.

1722
02:12:11,456 --> 02:12:13,583
I'II not taIk to him if he comes to me.
- Then don't taIk to me.

1723
02:12:21,733 --> 02:12:24,429
You...? You...here...?

1724
02:12:24,803 --> 02:12:26,498
You are marrying Arjun
for one sIap.

1725
02:12:26,972 --> 02:12:28,940
Then I wouId've got
sIapped many times.

1726
02:12:29,808 --> 02:12:30,604
Your marriage...?

1727
02:12:35,314 --> 02:12:38,511
I Iied to you again.
But this time for your good.

1728
02:12:38,884 --> 02:12:43,617
I know you stiII Iove Sharat.
I wanted to show you true Iove.

1729
02:12:43,989 --> 02:12:45,957
You can never escape
from true Iove.

1730
02:12:46,658 --> 02:12:48,125
Once you faII in Iove...

1731
02:12:59,338 --> 02:13:02,967
You sIapped twice, is it enough?
Go ahead and sIap 4 times.

1732
02:13:23,295 --> 02:13:25,320
I know you are angry on me.

1733
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:28,997
You'II threaten to go back to viIIage.
I'm aIso coming with you.

1734
02:13:30,369 --> 02:13:32,064
I'II never Ieave you.

1735
02:13:32,537 --> 02:13:37,941
How can I marry knowing weII
Sandhya stiII Ioves Sharat?

1736
02:13:39,044 --> 02:13:43,743
I'm sorry grand dad,
I disappointed you again.

1737
02:13:43,982 --> 02:13:45,609
I'm not angry on you.

1738
02:13:46,218 --> 02:13:48,345
The Arjun I knew 4 months
before was a different man.

1739
02:13:49,221 --> 02:13:55,285
Now I'm proud of you.
Arjun, I'm sorry.

1740
02:13:57,796 --> 02:14:02,961
I troubIed you a Iot.
I Iied that my heaIth is not good.

1741
02:14:03,235 --> 02:14:08,366
Do you know why I did aII this?
To find you a Iife partner.

1742
02:14:08,907 --> 02:14:10,602
I got one.

1743
02:14:13,245 --> 02:14:17,978
AII these days, I was against marriage.
Because I never knew what Iove was.

1744
02:14:22,587 --> 02:14:24,555
Now I know.
- Who is that girI?

1745
02:14:25,791 --> 02:14:32,560
It's aIright grandpa. By the time
I understood Iove it was too Iate.

1746
02:14:47,512 --> 02:14:50,743
Grandma, I'm very happy now.

1747
02:14:50,949 --> 02:14:53,076
I did nothing to you
for the past 12 years.

1748
02:14:53,285 --> 02:14:55,253
Now, I wiII do aII your
marriage arrangements.

1749
02:14:59,057 --> 02:15:01,423
My friend sent this to you from America.
You must open it.

1750
02:15:04,296 --> 02:15:05,058
For what?

1751
02:15:06,465 --> 02:15:07,830
For the favour you did
to my grandma?

1752
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:17,938
Did you agree to this
marriage whoIe heartedIy?

1753
02:15:18,143 --> 02:15:21,442
Just one hour Ieft for my marriage.
Why such question now?

1754
02:15:22,481 --> 02:15:27,612
The boy I met in the hospitaI...Krishna,
he is a very good boy.

1755
02:15:32,657 --> 02:15:37,720
I'm marrying a man who cured you.
What more can I ask for!

1756
02:15:39,164 --> 02:15:42,133
Happiness are in your words
and not in your eyes.

1757
02:15:50,175 --> 02:15:51,870
Grandpa, a smaII request.

1758
02:15:52,511 --> 02:15:57,881
I do not know C, C++,
Java, Java++, VB, SAP.

1759
02:15:58,083 --> 02:16:00,074
Can you get me a
software job in Germany?

1760
02:16:00,685 --> 02:16:03,745
You can't get any job in Germany
for your quaIification.

1761
02:16:04,356 --> 02:16:05,482
Then, I might get one in GuIf.

1762
02:16:05,857 --> 02:16:09,315
Today is Shravani's marriage
in ImperiaI Gardens.

1763
02:16:09,861 --> 02:16:11,328
Send her a bouquet.

1764
02:16:23,208 --> 02:16:29,613
Arjun, why did Sandhya & Sharat
met again in Iife?

1765
02:16:33,985 --> 02:16:35,577
Even if she is not marrying him,

1766
02:16:36,154 --> 02:16:38,588
Sharat wanted to know about
the guy marrying Sandhya,

1767
02:16:38,790 --> 02:16:41,850
and whether he'II take
good care of her or not.

1768
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:49,631
Driver, C'mon take the car.

1769
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:39,974
Is this the way to spray
the scented water?

1770
02:17:40,218 --> 02:17:42,243
Do it properIy.

1771
02:17:45,957 --> 02:17:47,322
Drinking on marriage?

1772
02:17:47,726 --> 02:17:49,523
It isn't your sister
I'm going to marry.

1773
02:18:02,140 --> 02:18:03,607
On that day...- I know you.

1774
02:18:03,808 --> 02:18:04,866
You're Shravani's friend, right?

1775
02:18:05,243 --> 02:18:06,335
You were there on
our engagement too.

1776
02:18:06,811 --> 02:18:07,937
I came to wish you
on your marriage.

1777
02:18:10,315 --> 02:18:11,282
ShaII I teII you something?

1778
02:18:11,816 --> 02:18:14,444
Everyone was saying
bad about you.

1779
02:18:16,821 --> 02:18:18,789
Shravani is a very good girI.
We were onIy...

1780
02:18:19,824 --> 02:18:20,950
I won't give a damn to it.

1781
02:18:21,159 --> 02:18:22,387
ReaIIy?- Sure.

1782
02:18:22,594 --> 02:18:25,119
I don't Iike to think
about her past.

1783
02:18:27,666 --> 02:18:30,692
So, you'II treat her Iike a princess.

1784
02:18:30,902 --> 02:18:33,029
No, I'II treat her Iike an angeI.

1785
02:18:36,308 --> 02:18:38,242
Goutam, Shravani is a very ....

1786
02:18:38,443 --> 02:18:40,138
...good girI. I know.

1787
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:41,376
So, that's it.

1788
02:18:53,925 --> 02:18:54,823
Who is he?

1789
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:56,049
My fiance's ex-boy friend.

1790
02:18:56,261 --> 02:18:57,922
Ex-boy friend or Sex-boy friend?

1791
02:18:58,963 --> 02:19:00,521
Did your fiance invite him
to the marriage?

1792
02:19:00,732 --> 02:19:01,664
May be.

1793
02:19:01,866 --> 02:19:03,891
''Down pour of Love''

1794
02:19:05,704 --> 02:19:07,501
Though you knew this before,
why did you agree to the marriage?

1795
02:19:08,707 --> 02:19:10,140
I was mesmerized
by her beauty.

1796
02:19:10,742 --> 02:19:12,607
The first time I saw her,
her beauty drove me mad.

1797
02:19:13,078 --> 02:19:15,273
I'II use her for a few months
and throw her out.

1798
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:17,004
Anyway, she is a second hand.

1799
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:22,787
Stop staring at us.

1800
02:19:27,425 --> 02:19:28,255
What's it?

1801
02:19:30,995 --> 02:19:32,690
How dare you hit the groom?

1802
02:19:42,974 --> 02:19:45,033
Sir...you?!

1803
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:49,806
He is Krishna Rao.

1804
02:19:50,248 --> 02:19:53,274
Your father was a driver
in his house.

1805
02:19:54,586 --> 02:19:56,110
I'II get you coffee.

1806
02:19:57,222 --> 02:19:58,621
How is Arjun?

1807
02:19:59,257 --> 02:20:01,122
So, you stiII remember him.

1808
02:20:02,594 --> 02:20:04,562
Catch him.

1809
02:20:20,145 --> 02:20:21,112
Who is he?

1810
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:24,580
I once feII in Iove with him not
knowing he is a cheat.

1811
02:20:24,783 --> 02:20:26,444
Now he has come to
ruin my marriage.

1812
02:20:28,119 --> 02:20:29,984
Hit him.- Don't marry him.

1813
02:20:30,622 --> 02:20:32,749
He is a cheat.- Who? Me?

1814
02:20:33,691 --> 02:20:34,885
PIease beIieve me.

1815
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:36,024
Why shouId I?

1816
02:20:36,461 --> 02:20:37,587
AII that you said were Iies.

1817
02:20:37,796 --> 02:20:38,922
He wiII cheat you.

1818
02:20:40,498 --> 02:20:42,090
He wiII ditch you.

1819
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:43,592
I do not know who you are.

1820
02:20:43,802 --> 02:20:44,598
How can I trust you?

1821
02:20:48,473 --> 02:20:49,371
I'm Arjun.

1822
02:21:20,004 --> 02:21:22,063
Ask them not to beat him.

1823
02:21:22,607 --> 02:21:24,370
PIease...ask them not to beat him.

1824
02:21:25,109 --> 02:21:26,667
Why are you crying?

1825
02:21:26,878 --> 02:21:28,971
He is a very good boy.

1826
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:30,943
Father Iied to you.

1827
02:21:31,783 --> 02:21:34,718
He paid for grandma's operation.

1828
02:21:34,919 --> 02:21:37,820
I heard him saying that he'II bear
the entire operation cost.

1829
02:21:38,022 --> 02:21:39,649
Goutam is not a good man.

1830
02:21:39,858 --> 02:21:40,882
I heard their conversation.

1831
02:21:41,092 --> 02:21:42,992
He taIks bad about you.

1832
02:21:43,194 --> 02:21:43,888
Don't beIieve him.

1833
02:21:44,095 --> 02:21:45,062
PIease.

1834
02:21:51,202 --> 02:21:52,396
Stop.

1835
02:21:53,538 --> 02:21:54,004
Don't beat him.

1836
02:21:54,205 --> 02:21:57,834
Come Arjun, Iets go.

1837
02:21:58,042 --> 02:21:58,974
I won't come.

1838
02:21:59,444 --> 02:22:00,376
Don't intertere, pIease.

1839
02:22:01,880 --> 02:22:04,508
Even now if he is hiding the truth,

1840
02:22:05,216 --> 02:22:06,979
it means he reaIIy Ioves you.

1841
02:22:08,119 --> 02:22:09,518
Am I mad to get beaten up?

1842
02:22:09,721 --> 02:22:12,189
Why are you begging for her Iove?

1843
02:22:12,390 --> 02:22:15,223
You said we can do
anything for true Iove.

1844
02:22:15,426 --> 02:22:16,620
And I'm doing that.

1845
02:22:17,195 --> 02:22:22,098
You can't get someone
who can Iove you this far.

1846
02:22:23,234 --> 02:22:25,930
Not just you, both of you
must Iove each other.

1847
02:22:26,137 --> 02:22:27,604
She toId me that
she doesn't Iove you.

1848
02:22:27,805 --> 02:22:29,864
Never mind.

1849
02:22:30,108 --> 02:22:31,700
But she must Iive
Iike a princess.

1850
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:32,706
And that's where my happiness Iies.

1851
02:22:32,911 --> 02:22:35,709
I can't see you getting beaten up.

1852
02:22:35,914 --> 02:22:38,280
Come...- PIease grandpa.

1853
02:22:38,483 --> 02:22:39,745
Don't Iose him.

1854
02:22:43,922 --> 02:22:44,980
They'II cheat her.

1855
02:23:31,002 --> 02:23:31,866
Shravani, he is a...

1856
02:23:33,137 --> 02:23:34,104
and I...

1857
02:23:40,011 --> 02:23:41,069
I Iied.

1858
02:23:42,413 --> 02:23:43,505
I hurt your feeIings.

1859
02:23:45,116 --> 02:23:47,744
But I didn't mean to hurt you.

1860
02:23:52,457 --> 02:23:53,947
PIease forgive me.

1861
02:24:03,334 --> 02:24:04,301
Is it paining?

1862
02:24:10,408 --> 02:24:12,308
Why were you so Iate?

1863
02:24:28,326 --> 02:24:29,520
Just throw him out.

1864
02:24:29,727 --> 02:24:30,819
Stop it.

1865
02:24:31,529 --> 02:24:33,793
They Iove each other.

1866
02:24:34,198 --> 02:24:36,462
If anyone dares to touch him,
your heads wiII roII down.

1867
02:24:37,101 --> 02:24:38,591
What's happening, father?
- Shut up.

1868
02:24:38,970 --> 02:24:40,028
Heard what he said?

1869
02:24:40,238 --> 02:24:41,102
Aren't you ashamed of yourseIf? Get out.

1870
02:24:41,305 --> 02:24:42,272
ShouId we Iisten to his words?

1871
02:24:43,541 --> 02:24:44,235
Shut up.

1872
02:24:44,542 --> 02:24:46,100
I shouId've done this earIier.

1873
02:24:52,750 --> 02:24:55,810
Sunny, is there anything eIse?

1874
02:24:56,454 --> 02:24:57,580
Grandpa...
