1
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,450
Don't get tensed.

2
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:57,749
Getting late to the convocation and
he hasn't yet turned up here.

3
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:46,417
It's a crime to rob and you did it.

4
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:50,925
It's a crime to threaten,
you pointed a gun.

5
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:57,891
You saw the gun in your hand but
not the bullet standing behind you.

6
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:04,102
I'll give you two options like others,

7
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,437
shall I beat you or leave you?

8
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:37,764
Did we ever think why earth is round?

9
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:41,470
Did we ever bother why sky is blue?

10
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:45,140
Did we ever ask why Sun is so bright?

11
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:48,809
Did we ever ask why wind is invisible?

12
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:52,479
Did we ever bother to keep track
of how long we've walked?

13
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:56,149
Did we ever inquire about
how old time is?

14
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:59,820
If we don't know the answer
to these questions...

15
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:03,627
There's nothing to lose,
just forget it...

16
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:10,165
Life is an endless question...

17
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:17,573
So, let's sing, dance and party...

18
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:44,206
Did we ever ask why man has
only one brain not two?

19
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,834
Did we ever ask why heart
beats lub-dub?

20
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:51,540
Did we ever get confused
why eye brows are not united?

21
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:55,208
Did you ever ask how many bytes
of memory your head has?

22
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:58,879
Did we ever search in Google what could
be the blood group of mosquito?

23
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:02,891
Did we ever bother to ask ant
why it loves sweets?

24
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:50,564
Did we ever ask why English
has 26 alphabets only?

25
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:54,269
Did we ever feel why a day
doesn't have 50 hours?

26
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:58,280
Did we ever think of why we say
hello on lifting a phone?

27
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,783
Did we ever ask why there's no
black and white in a rainbow?

28
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:05,616
Did we ever rewind our dreams to
see what's the colour of a dream?

29
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:05,767
She tried to run away...

30
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:17,247
Did you beat her in anger?

31
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,921
Control your anger.

32
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:24,251
That's your weakness.
I hate weakness.

33
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:34,068
Let's see later.

34
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:41,239
They'll come to know later...

35
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:49,783
What's the age of the girl?

36
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:54,118
Daily 10000, seven days a week,

37
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:57,125
by the time she's no more in demand,
we would've made 4 crores.

38
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:58,789
How much we can pay?

39
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:04,591
For those wounds,
we'll get 20 lakhs only,

40
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:09,099
but if you hadn't caught her,

41
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:10,935
we would've lost that too,

42
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,407
Two children.
- I know about you.

43
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,744
But you must know about me.

44
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:26,150
Do you know who I broke my leg?

45
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:31,219
I'll tell you a story, Peter.

46
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:36,664
When I was a little boy, my father used
come drunk and beat my mother,

47
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:38,962
unable to bear it,
my mother ran away,

48
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:41,135
he took that frustration on me,

49
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:45,800
I too tried to run away,

50
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:49,845
Fearing I'd escape again,
he broke my leg.

51
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,207
Do you know what did I do?

52
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:00,183
I killed my father.

53
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:04,855
Did I do the right thing?

54
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,164
I'll get another girl.

55
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:16,105
Now I like you more.

56
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:19,707
Finding men like you is very difficult.

57
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:21,869
Finding girls is very easy.

58
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,571
Brother, Kelly is Colombian mafia don,

59
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:58,573
he killed Prime Minister for
creating hurdles to him,

60
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,583
do we need to business with
such a ruthless man?

61
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:12,086
You can over estimate the others
but never under estimate ourselves.

62
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,949
First time when I enter into
a business deal,

63
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:44,617
I'll meet personally,

64
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:48,789
if I shake hands,
it means I'll do business,

65
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:54,264
if I leave the hand midway,
it means I've killed the other man.

66
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:58,640
Till now I've done business
with people I trust.

67
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:02,276
Though you don't trust me,
you've to do business with me.

68
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:03,641
You've no options.

69
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,282
I'm the lone supplier.

70
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,464
I too do business with girls.

71
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:27,297
But never bargain for girls.

72
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:32,466
I'll pay Rs.2 crores for each girl
instead of Rs.1 crore.

73
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:43,013
We're paying a crore for each girl,

74
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:45,348
we'll not keep quiet even
if there's a small problem.

75
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:49,516
If there's a small problem,
I too don't take it lightly.

76
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:58,161
If I had escaped from father in fear,
I would've lost my other leg too.

77
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:03,773
If I show pity and leave you,
I'll have to no business.

78
00:16:16,554 --> 00:16:17,885
Hi brother.
- Hi

79
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:21,787
Looks like you've come home
very late last night.

80
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:26,056
What's so delicious, sister-in-law?

81
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,219
Tamarind rice.

82
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:28,896
What's the occasion?

83
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:31,695
Is your graduation any
small achievement?

84
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:34,736
Do you know how long he
has been waiting for it?

85
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:38,364
Don't over do it, sister-in-law.
It takes 4 years to graduate.

86
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:40,204
Why do you say like that?

87
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:44,542
You've graduated and his dream
has come true. To celebrate...

88
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:46,910
You come with me.
- Where? - Come I say!

89
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:49,076
What?
- You too come, brother. - Where?

90
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:50,413
I'll tell you.

91
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:51,577
Sit here.

92
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,025
Isn't it Rajiv?

93
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,448
What are you looking at, bro?

94
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:23,610
Can we go in that ship, brother?

95
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:25,778
Where would you like to go?

96
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:29,620
When ever I asked about parents,
you said they live there.

97
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:31,284
Let's go there.

98
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:38,932
Very difficult.
- Why?

99
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:43,597
No tickets available in that boat,
it's booked for many years.

100
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:47,274
Can't we ever see our parents?

101
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:52,446
Why not?
You work hard and study.

102
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:55,984
Become an engineer and
build a big ship,

103
00:17:56,154 --> 00:17:57,143
let's go in that ship.

104
00:17:57,321 --> 00:18:01,655
Money? We don't have money
even to pay school fee.

105
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:04,659
Leave the worry of money to me.
I'll take care of it.

106
00:18:06,664 --> 00:18:10,794
In our childhood when I wanted to meet
parents, he said we need a ship,

107
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:17,138
Now I've to come home
to meet my parents.

108
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:24,171
Stay with us here,
please don't go to India.

109
00:18:24,348 --> 00:18:27,044
I told you I'll go to India after
my graduation, sister-in-law.

110
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:28,240
You agreed.

111
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:34,188
Okay, shall I give you two options?

112
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:37,020
No need, both would be
favourable to you only.

113
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:40,194
Simple sister-in-law, you come
along with me to India.

114
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:43,356
Brother would quit the job here and
come to India unable to live without us.

115
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:45,832
If I quit the job, they'll kill me.

116
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:48,870
Brother, you make some
mistake, they'll fire you.

117
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:15,726
How long your shopping will
continue sister-in-law?

118
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,629
When will the shop close?

119
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:55,731
I want to learn skating.

120
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:04,638
Is this girl a student or instructor?

121
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:07,634
Where did she go?

122
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:29,693
That lady? She ran away with
a young man.

123
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:52,886
Nothing sir, I want some information.

124
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:55,548
Do you think this is information bureau?

125
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:57,057
Go away.

126
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:58,718
The girl is very beautiful.

127
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:00,727
Your wife?
- Wife?

128
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:02,889
Would anyone keep quiet if wife
wears outfits like this?

129
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:04,034
He'll die in shock.

130
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:06,101
You don't such information here,
please go away.

131
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:10,530
Shall we sit in sofa and discuss?

132
00:22:18,716 --> 00:22:20,240
So, you're giving me permission, right?

133
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,579
Do one thing, pull the chair
and sit here,

134
00:22:22,753 --> 00:22:25,586
and watch us closely.
Get out!

135
00:22:52,283 --> 00:22:54,444
MMS?

136
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:58,452
Are you planning to send this to my wife
and blackmail me for money?

137
00:22:58,622 --> 00:23:04,288
Your plans don't work on me.
I've seen so many like you.

138
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:11,101
I'm gold if I love.

139
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:14,264
If I hate, you're finished.

140
00:23:14,438 --> 00:23:16,133
Did I say I'll send it to your wife?

141
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:18,605
Who will you send this to then?

142
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:20,141
I want to send it to her husband.

143
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:23,303
Will you send it to her husband?
What the hell can he do?

144
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:25,472
He won't do anything, he'll fire.

145
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:28,812
Fire? Chicken?
What does he do?

146
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:30,817
He's an encounter specialist.

147
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:38,985
Just say Janaki Ram, I'll answer.

148
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:40,494
Tell me, what do you want?

149
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:43,326
Just now you said about biscuit and gold.

150
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:46,959
Not biscuit gold, but chocolate gold.

151
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:49,639
If you love...
- Gold!

152
00:23:49,974 --> 00:23:52,807
If you hate...
- Brass! No need of details now.

153
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:55,502
Tell me what do you want?

154
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:58,809
Nothing, a girl came to skate
between 10 to 11 am,

155
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:00,348
I want her address.

156
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:03,009
We can't divulge information.

157
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:07,180
Girl, your husband's number...
- No... no need of her husband's number.

158
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:09,258
I'll give the address.
- Come.

159
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:09,750
Was my mom so coward
to commit suicide?

160
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:59,095
I don't think you need any more
information about him.

161
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:04,765
Generally such a man would marry in
family that earns 1000 crores profit.

162
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:08,708
Your luck, he wishes to marry you.

163
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:12,304
He'll meet you in two days.

164
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:17,648
Just in 10 minutes, impress him
with your behaviour.

165
00:26:19,156 --> 00:26:22,489
Shouldn't I like him?
- I like him, that's enough.

166
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:29,830
Where's her house?

167
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:45,838
Is she going to die or kill anyone?

168
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:32,225
It's very deep!

169
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:35,058
If you jump, you're sure to die.

170
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:37,063
Nothing much,
water will enter your body,

171
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:39,692
lungs will stop,
so heart will stop beating,

172
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:42,027
come on jump!

173
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:43,571
Who are you?
- Shut up!

174
00:27:43,707 --> 00:27:45,868
Do you need introductions
before committing suicide?

175
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:48,204
Who is committing suicide now?

176
00:27:48,412 --> 00:27:50,903
Why are you lying before death?
Accept it.

177
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:52,037
Lie?

178
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:54,741
Who should I inform after you die?
Will you give me any phone number?

179
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:56,078
Don't come near me.

180
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:59,749
Father or mother or lover?
You'll not have a lover.

181
00:27:59,923 --> 00:28:02,756
I told you not to come near me.
Don't come near me.

182
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:05,258
Bridge is there,
why are you jumping from here?

183
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:06,589
Can't you hear properly?

184
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:51,464
If you press so hard my intestines
will come out not water.

185
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:53,109
Are you fine?
- Yes.

186
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:53,936
Why did you do like that?

187
00:28:54,111 --> 00:29:00,641
You pressed on my stomach,
I thought you'd give resuscitation...

188
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,310
I heard it'll be good.

189
00:29:06,156 --> 00:29:07,316
Why did you jump without
knowing to swim?

190
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:10,483
I jumped to save you,
then I remembered I can't swim.

191
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:11,889
By then I gulped a lot of water.

192
00:29:12,996 --> 00:29:15,487
I thought it's not deep and walk out.

193
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,293
You carried me and I kept quiet.

194
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:31,311
Commotion, my heart is in chaos...

195
00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:36,578
This commotion is beautiful...
and it's endless chaos...

196
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:03,173
Will you knock the door
of my heart once?

197
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:07,716
Let the earth shattering commotion
find a way out...

198
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:16,220
Will you look into my eyes once?
You can see silent commotion...

199
00:30:16,393 --> 00:30:21,057
Night is fighting with day...
Eye ball is fighting with eyelid...

200
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:25,361
To be in your dreams always...

201
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:29,870
Silence is fighting with heart...
Love is fighting with life...

202
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,737
That you've stolen their place...

203
00:30:33,877 --> 00:30:38,371
What ever it is,
this commotion is pleasure...

204
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:18,952
In past I was king of kings...

205
00:31:19,122 --> 00:31:23,456
What happened in between...

206
00:31:23,627 --> 00:31:27,791
My heart is following the
Queen like her shadow...

207
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:32,265
I think troubles in love
are inevitable...

208
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:36,805
I've become a Romeo to offer a rose
every day because of you...

209
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,104
I've seen a Romeo in every street...

210
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,008
I wrote your name like
a poem in air...

211
00:32:21,184 --> 00:32:25,348
Poetry and tales are routine in love...

212
00:32:25,522 --> 00:32:30,016
I drew your painting using
flowers as brush...

213
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:34,357
Paintings and colours are
as old as mountains...

214
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:38,831
Are you making fun of love?
Have I become so cheap to you?

215
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:43,336
Why don't you take it easy
as unavoidable fun...

216
00:33:53,577 --> 00:33:54,771
Coffee is cold.

217
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:56,773
Coffee is hot!

218
00:34:04,788 --> 00:34:06,949
Coffee is cold!

219
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:23,796
Are the girls ready?

220
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:47,486
Coffee is hot man!

221
00:37:25,255 --> 00:37:26,654
Kelly knows this matter?

222
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:30,315
Kelly is in Colombia,
I didn't inform him.

223
00:37:30,493 --> 00:37:34,987
If I tell him, you'd not be alive
to talk to me now.

224
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:41,134
Return Rs.50 crores in a week.

225
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:43,795
Actually our deal is closed.

226
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:48,474
You paid Rs.100 crores,
I delivered 100 girls.

227
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:51,808
You failed to protect them,
is it my mistake?

228
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:54,010
I wouldn't say like that.

229
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:05,851
I like your approach.

230
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:09,362
You've come to the point,
I'll also come to the point.

231
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:13,162
Do you know how I lost my leg?

232
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:18,030
Charlie, I'll tell you a story.

233
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:21,204
Actually I'm an orphan.

234
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:24,541
I worked in a hotel.

235
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:29,375
After working for two months,
I asked salary,

236
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:32,047
he told me to show the work I did,

237
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:34,720
how can I show him the work I did?

238
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:37,724
I asked him the same thing.
He got angry.

239
00:38:38,395 --> 00:38:40,386
He broke my leg.

240
00:38:46,202 --> 00:38:51,071
Do you know what did I do then?

241
00:38:57,714 --> 00:39:02,413
In fear if I leave the owner,
I'll lose my leg too,

242
00:39:03,586 --> 00:39:08,250
if I leave you in pity,
I'll lose Rs.100 crores.

243
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:20,736
If Kelly comes to know this,
we'll be in danger.

244
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:25,396
Only if he comes to know, right?

245
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,741
If we had left him,
he would've told him.

246
00:39:29,913 --> 00:39:34,282
We killed him, so he'll not know
till we tell him.

247
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:42,955
Kelly isn't the problem,
but that unknown enemy is.

248
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:46,626
Find him.

249
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:51,589
Let's give his body to Kelly and
blame him for all the trouble.

250
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:54,827
Would he believe it?
- He has no other option.

251
00:39:56,773 --> 00:40:02,473
Put Kelly's brother's body in
godown and burn it down.

252
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:07,474
Clues about his meeting with us
must also be reduced to ashes.

253
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:42,173
Buildings in America are installed
with fire safety equipment,

254
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:43,341
how could it burn down?

255
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,010
Who is this RD anyway?

256
00:40:46,689 --> 00:40:48,179
How do you know?

257
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:50,349
Anyone who reads newspaper
would know it.

258
00:40:51,027 --> 00:40:55,521
What's that wound?
Had a fight again?

259
00:40:57,367 --> 00:41:00,165
How many times I've warn you
to stay away from fights?

260
00:41:00,336 --> 00:41:03,328
Calm down brother, how can you
call this also as fight?

261
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:06,202
Fight is what did in out childhood.

262
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:08,901
Do you remember the
fight with Chinchu?

263
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:11,271
We made him shiver, right?

264
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:12,709
Isn't it?

265
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,049
The hotel in which I worked,
Chinchu stole from it.

266
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:20,049
I told about this to the owner.
He was fired.

267
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:23,291
Chinchu got angry and
chased to beat me.

268
00:41:32,035 --> 00:41:33,525
Why are we running?

269
00:41:33,703 --> 00:41:35,864
They'll beat us if we're caught.

270
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:40,039
What if we beat them first?

271
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:11,570
It seems you're jumping into water
apart from fighting.

272
00:42:12,275 --> 00:42:13,902
It seems you bought skating shoes too.

273
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:19,609
Enough of staring, who is the girl?

274
00:42:20,283 --> 00:42:24,117
I don't know, she came to die
also in a big car, very rich.

275
00:42:24,787 --> 00:42:27,449
What's her name?
- Call her Mrs. Vishwa.

276
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:32,454
What if she already loves another man?

277
00:42:33,129 --> 00:42:34,460
After meeting me...

278
00:42:56,152 --> 00:42:59,485
I saw your photo first, had I seen you,
we'd be married by now,

279
00:42:59,656 --> 00:43:00,987
wasted a lot of time.

280
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:05,157
We need time to know each other, right?

281
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:06,317
Not necessary.

282
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:10,162
That's enough.

283
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:13,131
I'm giving a party tomorrow,
you're coming.

284
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:14,800
I've to go to skating.

285
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:17,397
Cancel it.

286
00:43:53,843 --> 00:43:54,537
What happened?

287
00:43:54,677 --> 00:43:59,546
Searched every place.
But didn't find him.

288
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:01,547
If we don't catch him, boss will...

289
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:04,550
Shall we do one thing?
- What?

290
00:44:04,721 --> 00:44:08,384
Boss hasn't seen him, let's kill
an Indian and say that's him.

291
00:44:08,558 --> 00:44:09,889
Bloody!

292
00:44:12,228 --> 00:44:17,063
If you're ready to like to boss,
how can I believe you'll tell me truth?

293
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:18,860
Tell me, bloody!
- I'm telling you truth, boss.

294
00:44:19,035 --> 00:44:22,027
Did you really search for him?

295
00:44:22,205 --> 00:44:25,038
I did search, boss.
- Shut up!

296
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:28,738
From this moment, use your contacts,

297
00:44:28,878 --> 00:44:31,745
use all our men,

298
00:44:31,914 --> 00:44:33,575
use your brain,
use the gun,

299
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:37,249
if you fail to catch him,
boss will not kill you,

300
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,910
or let you live too.

301
00:44:41,924 --> 00:44:42,822
Find him!

302
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:03,387
We searched all places but...

303
00:47:17,747 --> 00:47:19,374
Coffee is hot!

304
00:47:19,582 --> 00:47:24,076
Coffee is hot!

305
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:37,756
I want that day's CCTVfootage.

306
00:47:38,401 --> 00:47:41,632
Identify him and send his
photo to all our men.

307
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:55,307
Amit and Ria are going to marry
in near future.

308
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,814
Am I not talking to them?

309
00:48:23,646 --> 00:48:24,977
Who is giving this party?

310
00:48:25,982 --> 00:48:27,449
Let it be anyone, don't care.

311
00:49:16,532 --> 00:49:20,730
This one too Sheikh's!
- This one too Sheikh's!?

312
00:49:32,715 --> 00:49:34,046
Have you covered the entire world?

313
00:49:34,216 --> 00:49:38,880
Which ever country our Sheikh visits,
he comes back with a girl as memento.

314
00:49:39,055 --> 00:49:41,046
Why are you saying as
if it's a gift item?

315
00:49:41,223 --> 00:49:42,713
What would he do with so many countries?

316
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:45,224
Can't you leave few countries
for people like us?

317
00:49:45,394 --> 00:49:47,726
If he takes every girl,
what would we be left with?

318
00:49:47,897 --> 00:49:48,886
You?

319
00:49:55,204 --> 00:49:56,364
What about you then?

320
00:49:56,539 --> 00:49:58,370
Isn't Sheikh with me?
- Isn't Sheikh with me?!

321
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:00,907
From Nellore?
- You?

322
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:01,907
Same Nellore!

323
00:50:02,912 --> 00:50:06,541
Come, I'll introduce Sheikh.
- No... no, I'll not come.

324
00:50:06,749 --> 00:50:09,240
Recently a man tried his girl,
for that he...

325
00:50:10,419 --> 00:50:12,580
I'm telling you because
you're from Nellore.

326
00:50:12,755 --> 00:50:13,915
You carry on.

327
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:35,410
You're from Nellore, so...

328
00:50:50,126 --> 00:50:51,286
What is he doing here?

329
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:01,827
Why did he come here?

330
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:08,873
I think I've seen this play ground.

331
00:51:12,615 --> 00:51:13,604
What?

332
00:51:13,816 --> 00:51:15,147
Why are you here sir?

333
00:51:15,317 --> 00:51:17,547
Nothing, just planned a kidnap.

334
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:21,150
Don't you know anything other than
kidnapping and blackmailing?

335
00:51:21,323 --> 00:51:22,984
Which school did you study?

336
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:25,821
School isn't important but subject is.
- Subject?

337
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:28,657
Look there! Can you see Cinderella?

338
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:31,822
I'm going to kidnap her.

339
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:36,829
I'll take leave sir.
Where are you going?

340
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:41,136
After I kidnap her, shouldn't you be
here to tell about their reactions?

341
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:44,302
I mean they'll kill me sir.

342
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:46,638
It seems you tried to
impress Sheikh's girls.

343
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:50,678
Have you captured this scene too?

344
00:51:50,853 --> 00:51:53,845
Stella's husband...
- No... no... why would I go?

345
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:56,184
I'll stay here only.

346
00:51:56,358 --> 00:51:57,689
No problem, you can go.

347
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,452
Why would I go now?

348
00:51:59,695 --> 00:52:01,686
A small request sir.

349
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:03,862
Come quickly sir.

350
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:07,798
What has he got to lose?

351
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:39,864
Hey! Why are you following me?

352
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:41,696
Who is following whom?

353
00:52:41,871 --> 00:52:44,897
I'm not following you.
I came out for fresh air.

354
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:45,904
Fresh air in parking lot?

355
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:49,237
I didn't come out for you, right?

356
00:52:49,378 --> 00:52:50,902
But I'm here for you.

357
00:52:52,414 --> 00:52:53,711
Why?

358
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:56,578
Nothing, I want to give you 2 options.

359
00:52:56,752 --> 00:53:01,246
I'll be with you till you get bored,
or come with me till I get bored.

360
00:53:03,759 --> 00:53:05,249
Party will be over in 40 minutes.

361
00:53:05,427 --> 00:53:07,088
You'll be here in 30 minutes.

362
00:53:07,263 --> 00:53:08,924
They'll search for me if I go missing.

363
00:53:10,432 --> 00:53:13,230
If such people are inside,
you wouldn't come out.

364
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:27,276
Why are you so tensed?

365
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,615
Your life is in your hands.

366
00:53:29,785 --> 00:53:32,345
Live as you like for
the next 30 minutes.

367
00:53:41,964 --> 00:53:42,794
Why did you stop?

368
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:46,659
You haven't yet relaxed.
You want something. - What?

369
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:52,767
I don't steal.
- Am I a professional then?

370
00:54:16,498 --> 00:54:18,989
You said you don't drink.
- Is stealing my habit?

371
00:54:40,522 --> 00:54:41,181
What's this?

372
00:54:41,357 --> 00:54:45,020
They'll pay 1000 if we beat him.
If he beats us, we must pay 500.

373
00:54:45,694 --> 00:54:47,889
Did you pay 500 or take 1000?

374
00:54:49,031 --> 00:54:52,194
500 was never less and
1000 was never more.

375
00:54:54,003 --> 00:54:55,493
Why can't you just say can't beat him?

376
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:57,832
He... if I beat him...

377
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:06,203
How will you beat him?

378
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:09,210
He'll follow technique.

379
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:12,209
I'll follow emotion.

380
00:55:18,227 --> 00:55:22,459
He'll beat to defeat me,
I'll beat him to win.

381
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:24,722
He'll beat for money.

382
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:33,364
I'll beat for you.

383
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,252
But to beat him you need
50 minutes, right?

384
00:55:51,427 --> 00:55:52,826
30 seconds is more than enough.

385
00:55:53,429 --> 00:55:56,762
I've to spend time with
you not with him.

386
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:07,727
Shall we sit there?

387
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:15,332
What happened?

388
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:18,507
He's in this.
- In this?

389
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:21,813
He's there.

390
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,011
I've taken him into custody,
I'll hand him over to police.

391
00:57:27,189 --> 00:57:30,352
Don't drink in glass,
use bottle, nobody will come.

392
00:57:34,363 --> 00:57:36,695
You mustn't eat chicken like that.
- How to eat then?

393
00:57:36,865 --> 00:57:39,993
First pick it and then bang the thigh,

394
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:43,835
then, smell it,

395
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:48,841
then, keep the piece inside your mouth.

396
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:56,874
You must eat like this,
order another piece for you.

397
00:57:57,719 --> 00:57:58,549
What's this?

398
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,881
Amalapuram Pootharekulu(Sweet)

399
00:58:01,056 --> 00:58:04,548
We brought it from India
specially for Vishwa.

400
00:58:04,726 --> 00:58:06,057
Taste it.

401
00:58:20,409 --> 00:58:21,535
You shouldn't eat like that.

402
00:58:22,578 --> 00:58:24,045
Hold it in your hand.

403
00:58:26,582 --> 00:58:29,073
Enjoy the delicious smell.
Move it like this,

404
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:36,084
eat like this!

405
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:49,563
Why are you like this?

406
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:52,571
You can't find a more bad man than me.

407
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:55,073
You mustn't drink like that.

408
00:58:55,577 --> 00:58:58,774
It's known as shot.
It's very pungent!

409
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:02,781
Before drinking it close your eyes,
shut your nose,

410
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:03,940
lift it like this,

411
00:59:11,126 --> 00:59:12,115
you should drink like this.
Order another peg for yourself.

412
00:59:15,797 --> 00:59:16,456
What happened?

413
00:59:16,632 --> 00:59:19,465
If you want I'll
steal a peg from another table.

414
00:59:19,635 --> 00:59:21,603
Not that sir.
- Then?

415
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:26,298
Unable to bear sorrow,
I poisoned my drink to kill myself.

416
00:59:26,475 --> 00:59:31,105
You drank that too! There's no one
more unlucky than me.

417
00:59:31,313 --> 00:59:32,109
Poison?

418
00:59:33,315 --> 00:59:35,806
Any doubt? You're sure to die.

419
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:47,988
You want?

420
00:59:48,163 --> 00:59:50,063
You said it's poison, right?

421
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:58,804
If you cheat others you'll get cheated first,
to teach you we planned this drama.

422
00:59:58,974 --> 01:00:01,135
Didn't I've poison now?
- No.

423
01:00:01,343 --> 01:00:03,903
Then, tonight's party is on me!

424
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:20,851
Let your brain go crazy
with hot temper...

425
01:00:21,363 --> 01:00:25,094
Let lose your courage
and bravery...

426
01:00:25,867 --> 01:00:29,997
Forget the past and
break into ajig...

427
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:34,006
Let anyone say anything,
don't care...

428
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:36,701
Let them shout from roof tops...

429
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:40,008
Nothing can give you this pleasure...

430
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:49,389
Let the enthusiasm take over you,
your body and soul to dance heartily...

431
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:55,554
Without Telugu, Bengali, English,
and Marathi life is a big party...

432
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:07,108
Jeans, tracks, dhoti and loincloth,
if there's no difference, life is a big party...

433
01:01:56,458 --> 01:02:00,792
If you hear DJ's beat every day
your ears will pain...

434
01:02:00,962 --> 01:02:05,126
If you beat on tables like this,
it's a new rhythm of beat...

435
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,464
If you smoke the entire cigarette
yourself, there's no kick in it...

436
01:02:09,604 --> 01:02:13,938
If you share it, it'll give you kick
slowly and steadily...

437
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:18,102
If you eat chicken kebabs and dance
to your heart, sorrows would vanish...

438
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:22,649
Hot spicy mutton pieces would
help you strangely in intoxication...

439
01:02:22,818 --> 01:02:29,656
Refuse cold coffee, relish hot tea
and dance to your heart...

440
01:02:53,682 --> 01:02:59,518
What a magic you've spread on me...

441
01:02:59,688 --> 01:03:05,354
What magic charm you've done
to make me lose myself in bliss...

442
01:03:05,527 --> 01:03:11,022
You've drowned me in your smiles
and your charming words...

443
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:17,331
You've made created a Himalayan
chaos in fist sized heart...

444
01:03:40,562 --> 01:03:44,555
Think about this, my dear...
You can understand...

445
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:49,033
If you share happiness,
it'll increase manifolds...

446
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:53,573
Share your thoughts,
heart will become light...

447
01:03:53,742 --> 01:03:57,906
The more you gossip and
the more your friendship grows...

448
01:03:58,046 --> 01:04:02,210
There's a rule that you must
rock in your youth...

449
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:06,581
It's written to fulfill every desire
you have...

450
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:12,990
Girl switch off AC, breathe fresh air
and break into a dance heartily...

451
01:05:09,985 --> 01:05:12,977
Why is the phone so heavy?
Have you fed many numbers?

452
01:05:17,492 --> 01:05:18,652
Is Stella there?

453
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:19,987
Is she with her husband?

454
01:05:22,831 --> 01:05:25,163
Should he always be with her
without doing anything else?

455
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:27,460
Can't he go out to watch a film?
Look at me!

456
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:47,010
Boss, I got that day's CCTVfootage.

457
01:05:47,188 --> 01:05:48,416
Did you find him?

458
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:15,211
The mischief started off slowly...

459
01:06:17,385 --> 01:06:22,220
My breath isn't letting me
to be calm...

460
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:30,225
How did the cool vapour
enter my eyes?

461
01:06:34,035 --> 01:06:36,026
Still two more minutes.

462
01:06:36,204 --> 01:06:38,729
Thoughts are taking wings...

463
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:46,905
It's soaring into sky
with sweet desires...

464
01:06:52,754 --> 01:06:59,592
My path has changed track and
coming your way with strange wishes...

465
01:07:54,983 --> 01:07:56,644
Won't you tell me your name
at least now?

466
01:07:57,152 --> 01:07:58,210
Find it yourself.

467
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:00,219
Please tell me.

468
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:10,160
Where shall we go tomorrow?

469
01:08:16,304 --> 01:08:18,465
What yes? I'll strangle you.

470
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:41,590
Where did you go away, Amit?

471
01:08:54,509 --> 01:08:55,339
Forward it.

472
01:08:57,212 --> 01:08:57,940
Little further.

473
01:09:01,382 --> 01:09:02,371
Back...

474
01:09:36,084 --> 01:09:38,575
You don't have time for me any more.

475
01:09:39,087 --> 01:09:40,247
Do you know Rajiv?

476
01:09:41,589 --> 01:09:43,750
No dear...
- I'm also going out.

477
01:09:44,425 --> 01:09:46,916
I'm not going out,
but where are you going?

478
01:09:47,095 --> 01:09:48,255
To meet Ria.

479
01:09:49,097 --> 01:09:50,257
Learn from him.

480
01:09:53,101 --> 01:09:55,160
You were also like him
once upon a time.

481
01:09:56,404 --> 01:09:58,395
Do you remember what my dad said?

482
01:10:07,115 --> 01:10:08,207
Okay dear.

483
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,793
We pay them salaries,
that's why they do whatever we order.

484
01:10:21,963 --> 01:10:24,955
It's not wrong,
but women give their lives,

485
01:10:25,133 --> 01:10:26,464
you must obey them.

486
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:28,596
If I didn't trust you,

487
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:31,898
why would I bring you
from India and give you my position?

488
01:10:34,142 --> 01:10:38,306
But I can't find a better man
than you for my daughter.

489
01:10:40,481 --> 01:10:41,971
You can work later.

490
01:10:48,323 --> 01:10:52,817
If you're asking me to stay
so dearly, I've to stay.

491
01:10:53,328 --> 01:10:54,818
No office today.

492
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:04,127
Got late little.

493
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:13,811
Shave and go to office.

494
01:11:24,692 --> 01:11:26,182
Why did you bring me here?

495
01:11:39,674 --> 01:11:40,834
What happened?

496
01:11:44,045 --> 01:11:45,603
If you want I'll switch off the lights.

497
01:12:30,091 --> 01:12:33,754
Though I know about you,
I'm taking chance, right?

498
01:12:33,928 --> 01:12:37,762
When my brother died,
you should've informed me,

499
01:12:37,932 --> 01:12:39,593
you've made a mistake
by not informing me,

500
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:43,897
you've made a grave mistake
by not catching his killers.

501
01:12:44,105 --> 01:12:46,403
If I had committed the mistake,
I would've ran away.

502
01:12:46,574 --> 01:12:48,565
I wouldn't come to explain you.

503
01:12:48,743 --> 01:12:53,271
You lost Rs.100 crores.
I lost 100 girls.

504
01:12:53,915 --> 01:12:55,439
Who should I complain to?

505
01:12:57,785 --> 01:12:59,616
One man is responsible for this.

506
01:13:06,294 --> 01:13:08,785
My men are searching him.

507
01:13:34,322 --> 01:13:35,812
Brother? How come you're here?

508
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:39,153
That's okay, did you meet Ria?
- I did.

509
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,659
But I'm unable to understand girls.

510
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:46,322
Take it.

511
01:14:23,337 --> 01:14:24,770
I'll tell you a story.

512
01:14:28,509 --> 01:14:31,672
My father gave me a rupee to
buy a cigar when I was a boy.

513
01:14:31,846 --> 01:14:34,212
After paying a rupee
I was returning with cigar,

514
01:14:34,382 --> 01:14:40,548
a cyclist hit me,
cigar fell into the drain,

515
01:14:40,721 --> 01:14:42,882
when I told this to my father,
he didn't believe me,

516
01:14:43,057 --> 01:14:46,220
he got angry and broke my leg.

517
01:15:03,711 --> 01:15:05,235
Do you know what did I do then?

518
01:15:07,582 --> 01:15:11,575
I went into the drain pipe, searched it,
found it, washed it,

519
01:15:11,752 --> 01:15:14,585
I dried it and then showed it
to my father, and proved my honesty.

520
01:15:16,591 --> 01:15:18,582
Give me one chance.

521
01:15:43,784 --> 01:15:47,276
Your brother is like my brother.

522
01:15:48,122 --> 01:15:50,613
If I had chance I would've saved him.

523
01:15:58,132 --> 01:16:00,464
You said my brother is your brother.

524
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:08,003
If you want to live, I want him alive.

525
01:16:08,476 --> 01:16:14,381
The distance between you and me
is the speed of my bullet.

526
01:16:15,816 --> 01:16:18,910
That's the time it takes
for your death.

527
01:16:55,189 --> 01:17:01,856
If you don't find him in 3 days,
tell your boss no one would be alive.

528
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:04,991
What would you do if anyone kills
your brother like this?

529
01:18:09,764 --> 01:18:12,597
Will you cremate or bury his body?

530
01:18:17,705 --> 01:18:23,439
Michael is lucky; he won't know
the pain of cremation.

531
01:18:24,078 --> 01:18:29,607
I can feel the heat of sitting
alive on a burning bier.

532
01:18:29,917 --> 01:18:33,011
I made a mistake,
I should've asked you to catch him.

533
01:18:34,288 --> 01:18:35,448
Michael would be alive now.

534
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:36,783
I'll catch him sir.

535
01:18:38,059 --> 01:18:41,256
Don't catch him, kill him!

536
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:44,291
He must know what fear is!

537
01:18:44,465 --> 01:18:45,864
He must know what death is!

538
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,268
He must know who this RD is!

539
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:53,930
I don't want one, who works
for me in fear or love,

540
01:18:54,108 --> 01:18:56,770
I want one who works
with my vengeance

541
01:18:57,645 --> 01:18:59,044
I want you to be that man, Rajiv.

542
01:19:07,488 --> 01:19:10,719
10 years ago you killed
your boss for me.

543
01:19:14,895 --> 01:19:18,331
Can't you catch him?
I'm sure you'll catch him.

544
01:19:21,902 --> 01:19:24,393
What's up bro?
Smoking continuously.

545
01:19:24,805 --> 01:19:27,296
Nothing, just office work tension.

546
01:19:31,312 --> 01:19:34,611
Okay then, I'll give you two options.

547
01:19:35,015 --> 01:19:38,951
One, tell truth,
two, don't lie.

548
01:19:40,521 --> 01:19:42,011
Won't you leave me?

549
01:19:44,992 --> 01:19:47,859
My boss lost Rs.100 crore
project because of a man,

550
01:19:48,429 --> 01:19:49,794
now boss wants me to catch him.

551
01:19:49,964 --> 01:19:50,589
Catch him.

552
01:19:51,365 --> 01:19:53,356
I can if I know how he would look like.

553
01:19:53,534 --> 01:19:57,732
Then, super!
Take me and say you got him.

554
01:19:58,005 --> 01:19:59,233
I'll take care of other things.

555
01:20:01,475 --> 01:20:03,807
What's this brother?
You're doing too much.

556
01:20:04,678 --> 01:20:07,238
Anyway how did he lose Rs.100
crores because of one man?

557
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:16,221
I may be thinking too much
are you at least thinking?

558
01:20:17,224 --> 01:20:17,815
About what?

559
01:20:18,559 --> 01:20:19,218
About Priya.

560
01:20:20,895 --> 01:20:22,385
What's there to think about, bro?

561
01:20:24,765 --> 01:20:28,030
I know the name to call her,
to meet I know her address.

562
01:20:28,969 --> 01:20:30,027
Do you know her heart?

563
01:20:33,641 --> 01:20:34,039
Is she happy with you?

564
01:20:36,777 --> 01:20:38,005
Sometimes yes sometimes not.

565
01:20:41,015 --> 01:20:43,575
She smiles but not.

566
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,214
She may be having some problem.

567
01:20:48,088 --> 01:20:48,577
What?

568
01:20:49,256 --> 01:20:53,158
If there's some problem inside,
I know people how behave outside.

569
01:20:54,862 --> 01:20:55,954
What do you want me to do?

570
01:20:56,964 --> 01:21:00,957
Love isn't just happiness,
share her sorrow too.

571
01:21:01,769 --> 01:21:02,895
First get to know what's worrying her.

572
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:07,131
Remove it, you needn't have
to express your love.

573
01:21:08,108 --> 01:21:09,234
Eyes will express it!

574
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:11,543
Is experience talking?

575
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:14,270
Go boy!

576
01:21:22,957 --> 01:21:23,946
Okay, I'm coming.

577
01:21:32,299 --> 01:21:34,290
Brother, car keys.

578
01:21:38,739 --> 01:21:39,865
Where are you going at this hour?

579
01:21:40,641 --> 01:21:42,632
You told me to know her heart, right?

580
01:21:44,778 --> 01:21:45,972
It's on table, take it.

581
01:21:54,021 --> 01:21:55,955
What did you say?
Did you search everywhere?

582
01:21:56,357 --> 01:21:57,153
Except your house.

583
01:21:57,691 --> 01:21:58,680
No time forjokes.

584
01:22:10,104 --> 01:22:11,230
What are you searching?

585
01:22:11,772 --> 01:22:14,036
Brother said he left car keys here.

586
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:15,175
It's here.

587
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:18,610
Thanks sister-in-law
- Where are you going at this hour?

588
01:22:20,581 --> 01:22:26,383
I want to meet Ria right now,
discuss with her father,
marry her,

589
01:22:26,687 --> 01:22:27,915
and have children immediately,

590
01:22:33,193 --> 01:22:35,252
didn't you ever feel like having
children, sister-in-law?

591
01:22:39,533 --> 01:22:40,591
We've you, right?

592
01:22:47,841 --> 01:22:50,002
CCTVfootage shows him
watching this poster.

593
01:22:50,611 --> 01:22:52,511
We searched for him in
the drag race that day.

594
01:22:54,949 --> 01:22:56,439
He would've beat Michael with this.

595
01:23:02,556 --> 01:23:05,047
I think Michael was wrong in
thinking he was here for drag race.

596
01:23:06,193 --> 01:23:09,060
If he had come to drag race,
Michael would be alive now.

597
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:11,725
May be he has left LA by now!

598
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:18,536
Use our police contacts to get details of
Indians leaving LA in the last 4 days.

599
01:23:19,206 --> 01:23:23,370
I'll take care of flights,
you take care of roads and trains.

600
01:23:30,351 --> 01:23:33,149
Why are you taking me on
a walk at midnight?

601
01:23:34,521 --> 01:23:36,512
Bend.
- Bend? Why?

602
01:23:37,257 --> 01:23:39,384
You're asking too many questions.

603
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,822
Want me to call encounter specialist.

604
01:23:40,995 --> 01:23:42,257
No need...

605
01:23:47,935 --> 01:23:49,903
I'm bending here sir.
- Get up.

606
01:23:51,405 --> 01:23:53,396
Why did you ask me to bend
and then to get up?

607
01:23:53,574 --> 01:23:56,941
I thought the house would've a wall
and you'd be helpful to jump.

608
01:23:57,077 --> 01:23:57,941
No wall.

609
01:23:58,212 --> 01:23:59,770
Didn't you observe it
while visiting last time?

610
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:01,209
Last time I entered through gate.

611
01:24:02,149 --> 01:24:04,049
I'll go in, you stay here

612
01:24:05,753 --> 01:24:07,277
Why do they've a gate without wall?

613
01:24:07,454 --> 01:24:09,046
Call me if anyone comes.
- My fate.

614
01:24:44,992 --> 01:24:47,153
Why are you beating me?

615
01:24:47,728 --> 01:24:49,992
Will you beat for bending?
Will you arrest for saying Blackberry?

616
01:24:54,034 --> 01:24:57,401
By tomorrow morning,
I'll be out from here.

617
01:24:57,571 --> 01:24:58,560
Get my lawyer.

618
01:25:01,108 --> 01:25:03,736
Why till tomorrow morning?
Why not escape right now?

619
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:05,572
It's me... here!

620
01:25:10,684 --> 01:25:11,343
It's me!

621
01:25:12,686 --> 01:25:13,209
No need.

622
01:25:43,951 --> 01:25:45,976
Shall we go?
- I'll not come, you carry on.

623
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,209
Let's go together.

624
01:25:48,188 --> 01:25:51,646
If I go alone, police would come
and ask you.

625
01:25:52,126 --> 01:25:56,358
You'll tell them my plan.
Then, I'll get caught.

626
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:58,727
So, we must escape together.

627
01:26:00,701 --> 01:26:04,034
Bloody, I'll finish you today.

628
01:26:10,177 --> 01:26:12,577
What are you doing?

629
01:26:13,347 --> 01:26:14,245
I'm writing Love Chant.
- Love Chant?

630
01:26:15,816 --> 01:26:18,614
What a great difference you're
showing in your performance?

631
01:26:18,919 --> 01:26:19,977
You're no ordinary man.

632
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,911
Madam, he's planning jail break
and escape.

633
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:25,149
There's ajail map on his body.

634
01:26:25,392 --> 01:26:27,417
Entire escape plan is in details.

635
01:26:28,295 --> 01:26:29,421
Wait, I'll show you.

636
01:26:29,596 --> 01:26:31,587
Why are you giving a performance
sitting here?

637
01:26:31,999 --> 01:26:34,900
Get up! I'll take you to task.

638
01:26:35,068 --> 01:26:38,936
Tell madam. Tell her...

639
01:26:44,478 --> 01:26:45,911
It was the little earlier,
what happened to it?

640
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:52,610
It was there just now, I saw it.

641
01:26:53,453 --> 01:26:53,976
It was there.

642
01:27:01,328 --> 01:27:02,556
It wasn't there just now.

643
01:27:03,463 --> 01:27:04,122
What's this?

644
01:27:14,174 --> 01:27:17,610
No need sir, let's use it while
escaping from jail.

645
01:27:46,173 --> 01:27:48,937
Hello Laila...

646
01:27:49,409 --> 01:27:52,173
My heart has vanished
because of you...

647
01:27:52,579 --> 01:27:55,173
Where is it? Where is it hiding?

648
01:27:55,816 --> 01:27:58,717
Is it right before my eyes hiding
like stars in day time?

649
01:27:58,952 --> 01:28:05,016
Hello, enough of what you've
already done...

650
01:28:05,392 --> 01:28:11,524
You've hidden it in me
and don't play act innocence...

651
01:28:11,765 --> 01:28:16,828
You know my heart has
reached your heart...

652
01:28:17,838 --> 01:28:24,368
Yet why are you not taking
a step to reach out to me...

653
01:28:25,412 --> 01:28:29,371
Shall I lock it with lips?

654
01:28:31,485 --> 01:28:36,718
Is it what you always think?

655
01:28:51,238 --> 01:28:54,230
You let me kiss but
stop me after that...

656
01:28:54,374 --> 01:29:00,074
I want to hug you...
O my dear...

657
01:29:00,514 --> 01:29:09,752
If I let you hug me, you'll not stop
with it but ask for more...

658
01:29:09,923 --> 01:29:15,156
You've read my heart perfectly
said what's in there...

659
01:29:16,229 --> 01:29:22,725
You'll not get any greater wish
than it now...

660
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:27,734
Shall I play with your beauty?

661
01:29:29,843 --> 01:29:34,906
Is it what you always think?

662
01:29:49,363 --> 01:29:58,931
My heart isn't satisfied with once,
it keeps on asking for more...

663
01:29:59,139 --> 01:30:08,480
You don't have the right to cross
beyond kiss, it all depends on you only...

664
01:30:08,648 --> 01:30:13,642
That's enough for me dear,
won't I go around the sea?

665
01:30:14,721 --> 01:30:21,149
To fulfill your desire I'll not give you
a glimpse of my beach...

666
01:30:22,129 --> 01:30:26,725
Shall I drown you in happiness?

667
01:30:28,335 --> 01:30:33,170
Is it what you always think?

668
01:31:09,076 --> 01:31:14,207
You created problems for me and
can't bear you're doing business coolly,

669
01:31:14,681 --> 01:31:16,512
Take as much time as you want.

670
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:21,878
But every day you'll lose
one of your businesses.

671
01:31:55,589 --> 01:31:57,318
Andre, I left my mobile there.

672
01:32:41,401 --> 01:32:43,665
If each part of body
fails to function every day,

673
01:32:45,705 --> 01:32:46,763
how many days can he survive, Rajiv?

674
01:32:54,814 --> 01:32:56,645
We must kill like that.

675
01:33:10,430 --> 01:33:13,831
For the past 2 days you're showing
me hell roaming in the forest.

676
01:33:14,234 --> 01:33:20,332
We had a chance of living in jail,
why did you bring me to the forest?

677
01:33:21,374 --> 01:33:24,275
Beasts here wouldn't know our
language and show no pity on us.

678
01:33:26,613 --> 01:33:28,012
What's that? Tiger?

679
01:33:28,381 --> 01:33:29,507
Are you afraid of tiger?

680
01:33:29,649 --> 01:33:30,741
Aren't you afraid?

681
01:33:31,084 --> 01:33:36,249
I'm scared of cats.
- Cats? Why are you torturing me?

682
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:38,180
What have I done to you?

683
01:33:38,692 --> 01:33:40,421
Kill me, which will end the torture.

684
01:33:42,195 --> 01:33:42,923
Tiger!

685
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:54,129
Why are you pointing at me?

686
01:33:54,975 --> 01:33:57,944
What did you tell to it?
It is coming towards me.

687
01:33:58,378 --> 01:34:01,313
T seems it's hungry.
- You know Tiger's language too?

688
01:34:01,481 --> 01:34:02,880
I can talk with ants too.

689
01:34:04,217 --> 01:34:07,653
Talk to it later, it's coming
for me, tell it go away.

690
01:34:07,821 --> 01:34:10,221
Its terribly hungry,
it won't listen to me also.

691
01:34:12,959 --> 01:34:16,725
I beg you dear,
please don't come for me.

692
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:19,057
Do you know I'm very good man?

693
01:34:19,299 --> 01:34:22,826
I bent when he told me,
I showed Blackberry to the police,

694
01:34:23,203 --> 01:34:26,400
I beg you, please go away.

695
01:34:33,913 --> 01:34:35,039
Did you see how requested it?

696
01:34:35,715 --> 01:34:36,739
I too know tiger's language.

697
01:34:42,622 --> 01:34:43,919
It has come again.

698
01:34:47,994 --> 01:34:49,757
What is it planning to do?

699
01:34:50,964 --> 01:34:52,226
Tell it to go away.

700
01:34:52,432 --> 01:34:53,490
Had it been Komaram Tiger,
it would obey?

701
01:34:53,667 --> 01:34:54,998
This is foreign tiger,
it won't listen to me.

702
01:34:55,168 --> 01:35:02,734
It's coming near, may catch me. I beg you
Please stop it... tell it to leave.

703
01:35:44,184 --> 01:35:46,948
Why did you come?
- I know you're searching for me.

704
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:47,911
Come here.

705
01:35:52,992 --> 01:35:53,856
Where?
- Come.

706
01:36:02,202 --> 01:36:04,693
Why did you hide me?
Can't you tell I'm your boy friend?

707
01:36:07,674 --> 01:36:12,407
I jumped into water, fought for you,
can't you tell this to your dad?

708
01:36:16,116 --> 01:36:18,243
Shall I tell him then? I'll tell him...

709
01:36:38,037 --> 01:36:39,334
Aren't they kissing passionately?

710
01:36:45,145 --> 01:36:47,340
This will happen only
if two people co-operate.

711
01:36:52,952 --> 01:36:55,318
How long can I talk to you
without seeing face?

712
01:36:57,524 --> 01:36:58,684
Hey, your father is coming!

713
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:04,722
Isn't it good?

714
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:11,859
Thought it was true?

715
01:37:15,742 --> 01:37:17,175
What happened?

716
01:37:41,935 --> 01:37:44,233
Priya! What are you doing here?

717
01:37:50,944 --> 01:37:51,774
What are you doing here?

718
01:37:54,113 --> 01:37:55,102
What are you doing here?

719
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:04,281
You're going to marry soon,
will you take them along with you?

720
01:38:07,293 --> 01:38:08,282
They would think you're mad.

721
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:21,431
Where did he go away?

722
01:38:43,196 --> 01:38:44,424
Why are you turning your face?

723
01:38:45,231 --> 01:38:47,392
I'm not asking you to love
or marry me.

724
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:49,760
Just I'm giving you a better option.

725
01:38:51,804 --> 01:38:54,398
You needn't have to tell me.
- Okay, I'll not tell.

726
01:38:54,641 --> 01:38:56,472
But be clear about marriage.

727
01:38:58,344 --> 01:39:01,404
Heart or man? Money or love?

728
01:39:01,915 --> 01:39:03,473
Take a decision after
you're clear about it.

729
01:39:03,683 --> 01:39:04,274
Okay?

730
01:39:05,818 --> 01:39:06,443
One more thing,

731
01:39:08,655 --> 01:39:12,352
I didn't know why you left crying
that day from the bridge?

732
01:39:12,792 --> 01:39:13,759
Now I know.

733
01:39:15,762 --> 01:39:17,286
Your mother didn't commit suicide.

734
01:39:18,731 --> 01:39:22,132
I too came to know about it
after restoring this reel.

735
01:39:31,778 --> 01:39:34,338
I'm filling this with my love
and sending it to you,

736
01:39:34,981 --> 01:39:36,175
this is your birthday gift,

737
01:39:38,184 --> 01:39:41,017
sorry dear, I can't attend
your birthday tomorrow,

738
01:39:41,287 --> 01:39:44,381
daddy has a business party,
I must attend it without fail,

739
01:39:44,891 --> 01:39:46,722
what can I do?
I've to fight with daddy.

740
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:49,487
Fights between us quite common.

741
01:39:50,129 --> 01:39:52,893
If you see all this,
you would lose hope on marriage.

742
01:39:53,399 --> 01:39:57,199
That's why I've sent you away
to boarding school.

743
01:39:58,271 --> 01:40:01,035
Who else do I've to share my feelings?
Except you.

744
01:40:01,207 --> 01:40:02,834
I too don't like this life.

745
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:08,278
One more thing, know about love
from this young age itself,

746
01:40:08,848 --> 01:40:10,440
don't worry about how much you love,

747
01:40:11,117 --> 01:40:14,177
take decision after seeing
how much he loves you.

748
01:40:47,286 --> 01:40:48,184
I'll tell daddy.

749
01:40:56,229 --> 01:40:58,789
Where are you Vishwa?
- Me? At home.

750
01:40:59,032 --> 01:41:00,294
Why is your voice shivering?

751
01:41:00,466 --> 01:41:01,194
Any problem?

752
01:41:02,135 --> 01:41:04,262
No, I want to meet and
tell you something.

753
01:41:04,437 --> 01:41:06,132
I'm also with the same feeling.

754
01:41:06,606 --> 01:41:07,971
I want to meet and
tell you something.

755
01:41:08,908 --> 01:41:09,431
What's it?

756
01:41:09,609 --> 01:41:12,442
It won't be nice to tell on phone.
I'll tell when I meet you.

757
01:41:20,486 --> 01:41:21,248
What's this?

758
01:41:21,421 --> 01:41:24,254
This is the home where me
and the girl I love would stay.

759
01:41:26,192 --> 01:41:27,159
Come, I'll show you.

760
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,986
That's mother and father,
I mean brother and sister-in-law.

761
01:41:31,464 --> 01:41:32,328
Their room.

762
01:41:32,765 --> 01:41:33,959
This is for children.

763
01:41:36,536 --> 01:41:37,468
That is swimming pool.

764
01:41:39,472 --> 01:41:42,839
My father-in-law comes often,
he'll stay there.

765
01:41:43,509 --> 01:41:45,443
Terrace is exclusive for me.

766
01:41:46,446 --> 01:41:47,413
For we two.

767
01:41:48,181 --> 01:41:50,308
Stars above and down below we.

768
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:54,183
Close... very close...

769
01:41:55,521 --> 01:41:58,957
Very... very... close...
- Who is the girl?

770
01:42:01,761 --> 01:42:03,695
You didn't how my house plan is!

771
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:05,188
Tell me first who is the girl?

772
01:42:06,999 --> 01:42:12,995
I don't know if she loves me,
I don't know if she realised my love.

773
01:42:13,539 --> 01:42:17,168
Didn't yet get me, Vishwa.
How much I love you!

774
01:42:32,391 --> 01:42:35,656
Sweet boy...
razor sharp eyed boy...

775
01:42:35,928 --> 01:42:39,386
Look at this beauty...

776
01:42:40,533 --> 01:42:43,627
Young boy... mischievous boy...

777
01:42:43,936 --> 01:42:47,463
Pull the diamond towards you...

778
01:42:48,407 --> 01:42:52,173
I'm a Diwali lamp...
I'm fragrance incense...

779
01:42:52,345 --> 01:42:55,337
With a beauty to rake up
desires in you...

780
01:42:56,249 --> 01:43:00,242
I'm a rope to tie you...
I'm hot spice appearing like sweet...

781
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:03,748
Any day I wish to be yours...

782
01:43:12,365 --> 01:43:16,062
I'm enticing intoxication...
A life saving poison...

783
01:43:16,335 --> 01:43:19,566
Friendship that runs down deep
into heart and touches soul...

784
01:43:20,406 --> 01:43:24,240
I'm a fragrant arrow...
I'll rock your life...

785
01:43:24,477 --> 01:43:27,469
Stick on to this epic of Cupid...

786
01:44:00,613 --> 01:44:04,310
My youth is moving like a swing...

787
01:44:04,650 --> 01:44:08,313
When you stare at me like that...

788
01:44:08,754 --> 01:44:12,315
I feel like the dream is coming true...

789
01:44:12,725 --> 01:44:16,161
My heart is soaring into sky
like a bird...

790
01:44:16,329 --> 01:44:19,662
f you give me place next to you,
I'll give myself to you...

791
01:44:19,932 --> 01:44:23,368
If you give me place in your heart,
I'll hide myself in you...

792
01:44:24,237 --> 01:44:27,638
If you give your heart,
I'll give you my heart...

793
01:44:27,807 --> 01:44:31,641
If you let me your partner for life,
I'll give myself...

794
01:45:14,787 --> 01:45:22,387
You appear like thousands
all around me...

795
01:45:22,695 --> 01:45:30,124
As you come near me,
you rake up passions in my youth...

796
01:45:30,403 --> 01:45:33,531
Will you step forward?
Will you battle with me?

797
01:45:33,706 --> 01:45:37,836
Take me somewhere,
it's all your will and wish...

798
01:45:38,377 --> 01:45:41,710
Will you bring deluge or
make me feel pain is pleasure?

799
01:45:41,881 --> 01:45:46,079
Or make me commit the sin,
I'm all yours...

800
01:46:16,248 --> 01:46:16,873
You?

801
01:46:18,284 --> 01:46:19,273
Why did you come here?

802
01:46:19,952 --> 01:46:23,410
I've made a map.
Shouldn't I come here?

803
01:46:23,823 --> 01:46:27,088
Why not? You can come.
Just asking why are you here?

804
01:46:27,293 --> 01:46:31,389
Jaffer's hell, Gabbar's bell,
Obama well, white house swell.

805
01:46:31,564 --> 01:46:32,030
You mean?

806
01:46:40,206 --> 01:46:41,138
How are the girls?

807
01:46:43,542 --> 01:46:45,772
Map will be much better.
- Map?

808
01:46:48,681 --> 01:46:50,308
You can see it very well from here.

809
01:46:52,518 --> 01:46:54,816
Obama's Whitehouse.
- Why tell me?

810
01:46:54,987 --> 01:46:55,646
I'll tell you.

811
01:47:00,993 --> 01:47:01,550
Is it good?

812
01:47:02,795 --> 01:47:04,092
This is president's bedroom.

813
01:47:05,131 --> 01:47:07,827
AC comes from here like this.

814
01:47:08,834 --> 01:47:09,562
Cool!

815
01:47:10,202 --> 01:47:12,170
AC in bedroom.

816
01:47:12,304 --> 01:47:15,171
We'll come through AC duct this way.

817
01:47:15,775 --> 01:47:16,400
We both?

818
01:47:16,942 --> 01:47:18,534
They?
- You want them?

819
01:47:19,445 --> 01:47:22,175
Bloody! We both are going there
to kill the president. - To kill?

820
01:47:26,318 --> 01:47:28,252
What a life is yours!

821
01:47:28,788 --> 01:47:30,847
You show an MMS and tell me to wish.

822
01:47:31,323 --> 01:47:33,223
He shows map and tells me to murder.

823
01:47:33,759 --> 01:47:35,124
Why should I live? Mere waste.

824
01:47:35,494 --> 01:47:38,691
Kill me... kill me...
- What happened? What's the problem?

825
01:47:38,864 --> 01:47:40,422
If you ask, what can I tell you?

826
01:47:44,837 --> 01:47:47,203
That's all, I'll talk to him, wait.

827
01:48:09,061 --> 01:48:10,619
Why are you taking her?
She's my secretary.

828
01:48:10,963 --> 01:48:12,453
What chocolate did you give her?

829
01:48:13,499 --> 01:48:15,967
I gave her Bar-One!

830
01:48:19,171 --> 01:48:20,832
What did you tell them?
They left the place.

831
01:48:21,407 --> 01:48:25,537
Nothing, I told them you're most
foolish man on earth.

832
01:48:25,878 --> 01:48:28,039
I told them if he troubles you,
they'll get ruined.

833
01:48:28,414 --> 01:48:29,574
You...
- No need.

834
01:48:30,316 --> 01:48:32,079
I can't bear this praise.

835
01:48:32,251 --> 01:48:35,243
Now, that MMS...
- No... no...

836
01:48:35,788 --> 01:48:39,087
No need of MMS, just order me,
I'll go there.

837
01:48:39,358 --> 01:48:42,850
I want to tell you I've deleted
that MMS.

838
01:48:43,095 --> 01:48:45,586
Deleted it? Is it? Why?

839
01:49:18,931 --> 01:49:22,458
Once if we commit a mistake,
every man will start bargaining.

840
01:49:22,735 --> 01:49:24,100
How do I appear to them?

841
01:49:24,503 --> 01:49:25,595
I've become cheap to them, Rajiv.

842
01:49:32,011 --> 01:49:33,478
How is your family?

843
01:49:35,915 --> 01:49:36,904
Fine sir.

844
01:49:37,216 --> 01:49:40,310
Is he also fine?
- We'll find him sir.

845
01:49:40,653 --> 01:49:41,483
Not yet found him, right?

846
01:49:43,155 --> 01:49:45,487
How many times will you
tell the same answer?

847
01:49:47,026 --> 01:49:50,462
I've a doubt, are you not
able to catch him...

848
01:49:50,829 --> 01:49:51,955
Or you don't like to catch him?

849
01:49:56,602 --> 01:50:00,436
Take time to kill but not to find him.

850
01:50:01,907 --> 01:50:04,603
I don't know what to tell Kelly!

851
01:50:11,150 --> 01:50:11,673
What's this?

852
01:50:13,619 --> 01:50:18,852
Sweetheart! How many times told you
to be careful while cutting vegetables?

853
01:50:21,527 --> 01:50:22,516
Is it paining?

854
01:50:24,863 --> 01:50:26,854
I got cut because of Vishwa's
skating shoes.

855
01:50:33,505 --> 01:50:34,995
He would've used this to hit Michael.

856
01:50:44,917 --> 01:50:46,384
He hit Michael with
ice skating shoes only.

857
01:50:46,552 --> 01:50:47,041
So what?

858
01:50:47,386 --> 01:50:49,877
Ice skating rink is in
the same Orchard mall.

859
01:50:50,055 --> 01:50:52,990
He bought coffee there only.
He bought skating shoes also.

860
01:50:53,392 --> 01:50:55,622
Search him there only.
I'm sure you'll get him.

861
01:51:25,257 --> 01:51:26,019
You want me to tie it?

862
01:52:35,828 --> 01:52:37,989
Come... come...

863
01:53:42,027 --> 01:53:44,552
Wrong! She's already engaged.

864
01:55:11,016 --> 01:55:15,817
Priya, last warning,
your marriage is fixed with Amit.

865
01:55:18,156 --> 01:55:20,818
If you don't meet him,
it's good for him.

866
01:55:25,964 --> 01:55:27,431
I like Vishwa, dad.

867
01:55:31,103 --> 01:55:33,469
Why do you like him so much?

868
01:55:33,872 --> 01:55:37,273
If you ask why you like mother's
cooking? What can anyone say?

869
01:55:39,344 --> 01:55:43,474
Though he can't swim, he loved
so much to jump into river for me.

870
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:49,010
When I didn't talk to him, he came
at midnight to see if I'm alright.

871
01:55:50,255 --> 01:55:53,190
When I didn't eat,
he used request earnestly.

872
01:55:54,526 --> 01:55:56,517
When I was sad, he consoled me.

873
01:55:57,529 --> 01:55:59,793
When I was angry, he made me smile.

874
01:56:01,767 --> 01:56:04,463
Till now I thought only cry
can bring tears.

875
01:56:05,971 --> 01:56:08,405
Vishwa showed me there are
tears of happiness too.

876
01:56:22,854 --> 01:56:26,312
After mother's death,
I'm smiling now, dad.

877
01:56:27,693 --> 01:56:29,558
You don't know this
until I tell you.

878
01:56:30,762 --> 01:56:38,032
Because you don't have time to
know me or what I really want.

879
01:56:41,239 --> 01:56:44,834
If you want to fix my marriage
with a man who is just like you,

880
01:56:48,814 --> 01:56:49,838
I don't want Amit.

881
01:56:50,549 --> 01:56:52,449
I want Vishwa. I want Vishwa only.

882
01:56:53,151 --> 01:56:55,346
Are you done?

883
01:56:56,355 --> 01:56:59,518
Now, I'll tell you, listen carefully.

884
01:57:00,659 --> 01:57:01,921
You will marry Amit only.

885
01:57:02,527 --> 01:57:06,930
There's no change in marriage day or
my decision, and will never change.

886
01:57:13,372 --> 01:57:16,205
Young girl, we've to tell in a way
she understands.

887
01:57:16,775 --> 01:57:18,299
We too must understand her, uncle.

888
01:57:19,144 --> 01:57:22,409
She's saying so much about him,
I think it's better to meet him once.

889
01:57:23,749 --> 01:57:26,013
This is life not our business.

890
01:57:31,890 --> 01:57:32,618
I'll meet him tomorrow.

891
01:57:35,127 --> 01:57:35,957
For your sake.

892
01:57:43,268 --> 01:57:44,360
You must kill him.

893
01:58:12,330 --> 01:58:16,790
I'm afraid, I think my father will
not agree for our marriage.

894
01:58:19,705 --> 01:58:22,139
I must tell your dad
how much I love you, right?

895
01:58:23,408 --> 01:58:26,002
Did you ever tell me
how much you love me?

896
01:58:31,049 --> 01:58:34,018
Do you know we haven't yet
expressed love for each other?

897
01:58:37,889 --> 01:58:39,447
That's love!

898
01:58:40,792 --> 01:58:43,522
Mother, father, sisters, brothers,

899
01:58:43,729 --> 01:58:45,162
we never express our love to them.

900
01:58:46,598 --> 01:58:47,929
It isn't something
understood in words.

901
01:58:48,767 --> 01:58:50,064
Just feel and understand it.

902
01:58:53,271 --> 01:58:56,866
One more thing, what did happen
here 10 minutes earlier?

903
01:58:58,877 --> 01:59:01,209
We discussed about my mother's
death on this bridge.

904
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:02,772
What is happening now?

905
01:59:04,182 --> 01:59:06,650
We're discussing that my dad
may not agree for our marriage.

906
01:59:06,985 --> 01:59:08,111
What would happen next minute?

907
01:59:09,788 --> 01:59:10,720
What would happen?

908
01:59:11,256 --> 01:59:16,193
Look, how excited your face turned
hearing about next moment.

909
01:59:18,263 --> 01:59:21,198
Look at life too like that,
every minute would be exciting.

910
01:59:23,101 --> 01:59:28,539
You said about love, right? I'll tell not
only your dad but his dad too.

911
01:59:35,413 --> 01:59:36,539
Matter is very simple.

912
01:59:39,684 --> 01:59:43,051
Like I give 2 options to everyone,
I'm giving you also 2 options.

913
01:59:43,789 --> 01:59:46,758
One, make her my wife.

914
01:59:47,325 --> 01:59:49,759
Two, make me your son-in-law.

915
01:59:51,396 --> 01:59:52,021
If I say no?

916
01:59:52,898 --> 01:59:55,093
There will be fights.
- I heard.

917
01:59:55,567 --> 01:59:58,365
Getting beaten by goons in streets
by picking fights with them,

918
01:59:58,804 --> 02:00:00,169
and getting chided
by family members.

919
02:00:01,406 --> 02:00:02,839
You're insulting us.

920
02:00:03,074 --> 02:00:05,008
Be happy for letting you into my home.

921
02:00:05,577 --> 02:00:07,841
What makes you so proud?
What do we lack?

922
02:00:08,013 --> 02:00:10,379
Money, Amit has 500 crores wealth,

923
02:00:12,450 --> 02:00:13,178
what do you have?

924
02:00:13,485 --> 02:00:14,110
I've education.

925
02:00:14,386 --> 02:00:15,080
Not enough.

926
02:00:16,688 --> 02:00:18,280
I've love.
- Not enough.

927
02:00:21,293 --> 02:00:22,282
I've a brother.

928
02:00:25,430 --> 02:00:28,456
Look, love may be enough
for marriage,

929
02:00:29,167 --> 02:00:32,193
but for living, you need money.

930
02:00:34,506 --> 02:00:35,564
You don't have it.

931
02:00:37,943 --> 02:00:39,968
This marriage will not happen.

932
02:00:46,218 --> 02:00:47,810
My brother said it for fun.

933
02:00:48,453 --> 02:00:49,818
Yes, don't feel sad.

934
02:00:50,822 --> 02:00:53,814
I overacted, if your dad refuses.

935
02:00:54,226 --> 02:00:55,659
My brother will elope
with you, will you?

936
02:00:56,361 --> 02:00:59,091
You keep quiet.
- No, little... - Shut up.

937
02:01:01,233 --> 02:01:04,794
I don't want money, sister,
I want a family like this.

938
02:01:08,473 --> 02:01:13,001
Sister-in-law, I too don't want her
dad's money, I just want her only.

939
02:01:42,073 --> 02:01:48,342
Hey girl, you're my sweet Cinderella...

940
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:51,472
I'll keep a dot of bindi
on your forehead...

941
02:01:55,620 --> 02:01:58,714
O Greek warrior!
This is all yours...

942
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:01,723
I'll tie my silk sari end
with your shirt...

943
02:02:05,563 --> 02:02:08,157
Fast beat... my heart wishes...

944
02:02:08,934 --> 02:02:12,267
My tender finger wishes you
to become diamond ring in it...

945
02:02:12,537 --> 02:02:15,529
My heart wishes you to be with me...

946
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:18,538
Let's become number one couple...

947
02:02:22,781 --> 02:02:25,648
This lady luck is ready...

948
02:02:26,251 --> 02:02:29,414
Let the marriage band play...

949
02:02:57,449 --> 02:03:04,116
O dear, shall I put up our marriage canopy
on Eiffel tower in the heart shape...

950
02:03:04,356 --> 02:03:07,416
And tie the knot with you...

951
02:03:11,229 --> 02:03:14,130
Shall I arrive in an airbus palanquin...

952
02:03:14,666 --> 02:03:17,635
Sit like a docile girl to marry you...

953
02:03:18,036 --> 02:03:21,130
And make temporary place
in heart permanent...

954
02:03:24,476 --> 02:03:27,604
O my dear, song and dance...

955
02:03:29,114 --> 02:03:31,639
Every one must say
what an awesome marriage!

956
02:04:21,332 --> 02:04:24,324
Like a chocolate wrapper
and gift pack paper...

957
02:04:24,869 --> 02:04:27,997
I'll wrap you from all sides,
my dear ice maiden...

958
02:04:28,306 --> 02:04:31,400
I'll stick on to you like a sticker...

959
02:04:35,246 --> 02:04:38,113
Like a parrot in cage,
like a fevicol magnet...

960
02:04:38,583 --> 02:04:41,552
I'll always be with you like
a locket around your neck...

961
02:04:42,053 --> 02:04:45,147
I don't like even a centimetre
gap between you and me...

962
02:04:48,593 --> 02:04:51,721
He girl, come my sweet rasagolla...

963
02:04:52,097 --> 02:04:55,123
Let your shadow and
my shadow merge into one...

964
02:05:47,185 --> 02:05:47,776
Did you call me?

965
02:05:52,423 --> 02:05:54,721
He'll be before you by tomorrow, sir.

966
02:05:58,997 --> 02:06:00,464
He'll be before me in an hour.

967
02:06:02,367 --> 02:06:03,629
When I'm in haste,

968
02:06:04,202 --> 02:06:06,363
no sir, please calm down,
you should be saying that, right?

969
02:06:06,971 --> 02:06:10,099
If I had killed him, I would've
missed a very big contract.

970
02:06:10,508 --> 02:06:11,236
Who gave you sir?

971
02:06:11,776 --> 02:06:12,936
How much they gave sir?

972
02:06:13,111 --> 02:06:16,945
Had you asked that you'd be
in my place now.

973
02:06:26,958 --> 02:06:28,425
He?
- That's him.

974
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:30,154
Andre recognised him.

975
02:06:31,696 --> 02:06:35,826
When I see him, I've decided on
what story to narrate!

976
02:06:36,768 --> 02:06:37,894
Did he beat so many people?

977
02:06:38,736 --> 02:06:39,725
He did beat, right?

978
02:06:41,439 --> 02:06:43,031
But still where does the world go?

979
02:06:43,908 --> 02:06:47,435
Whether you sell a girl or
kill a man, it gives you a crore.

980
02:06:50,682 --> 02:06:54,880
Sir, I'll call my wife once...

981
02:07:20,745 --> 02:07:22,178
Why are you in a hurry, brother?

982
02:07:34,292 --> 02:07:36,055
Your passport and tickets,
go to India.

983
02:07:36,761 --> 02:07:38,956
India? I'll not go.
- You must go.

984
02:07:39,664 --> 02:07:42,064
If I go away suddenly,
Ria may mistake me.

985
02:07:42,233 --> 02:07:43,200
I'll talk to Ria.

986
02:07:43,735 --> 02:07:46,363
Any problem with my love for Ria?

987
02:07:48,339 --> 02:07:52,298
I can't bear if anything
happens to you. Go!

988
02:07:53,411 --> 02:07:55,311
Tell me one reason, I'll go brother.

989
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:59,746
You don't need to know,
if you trust me, just go.

990
02:07:59,917 --> 02:08:02,545
It's not about trusting you,
tell me one reason, I'll go.

991
02:08:03,888 --> 02:08:05,879
I've never denied anything
to you since childhood.

992
02:08:06,858 --> 02:08:11,090
Please for once leave this
place without refusing me.

993
02:08:11,329 --> 02:08:13,923
No brother. - If you don't go,
it's a promise on me.

994
02:10:48,219 --> 02:10:50,084
I don't know what's happening...

995
02:10:54,892 --> 02:10:55,916
Everything will get cleared.

996
02:12:13,938 --> 02:12:15,735
Why did you force me to go to India?

997
02:12:16,107 --> 02:12:17,631
Why were they trying to kill you?

998
02:12:18,543 --> 02:12:20,306
I'm not a good man as you think.

999
02:12:21,846 --> 02:12:23,438
I'm working for RD.

1000
02:12:24,982 --> 02:12:28,418
When I was working with your sister-in-law's
father's real estate business.

1001
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:29,877
One day...

1002
02:12:30,621 --> 02:12:35,024
If anyone enters my business
I don't have any problem,

1003
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:37,252
But mustn't become my competitor.

1004
02:12:37,528 --> 02:12:39,018
If he becomes, he mustn't live.

1005
02:12:39,664 --> 02:12:41,825
Technically, I've to kill you first.

1006
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:46,502
Because you're behind his success.

1007
02:12:47,271 --> 02:12:50,866
So, you've to become the
man behind his death.

1008
02:12:51,075 --> 02:12:53,805
Will you kill or get killed?

1009
02:12:56,047 --> 02:12:57,810
Think about your family.

1010
02:13:00,251 --> 02:13:03,220
You know everything in business
except killing.

1011
02:13:05,590 --> 02:13:06,852
Start with him.

1012
02:14:02,580 --> 02:14:06,778
He threatened to kill our family
if I didn't do as he says.

1013
02:14:07,284 --> 02:14:09,013
If I quit the job, they'll kill me.

1014
02:14:12,556 --> 02:14:14,046
Finding no way to escape,

1015
02:14:15,459 --> 02:14:16,949
not enough courage to
go against them,

1016
02:14:17,962 --> 02:14:19,293
not brave enough to die.

1017
02:14:19,463 --> 02:14:20,896
You should've told me about this.

1018
02:14:21,699 --> 02:14:23,030
How am I to tell you?

1019
02:14:23,401 --> 02:14:26,268
You can't bear if strangers get hurt.

1020
02:14:27,738 --> 02:14:31,105
Will you keep quiet if your
brother is in troubles?

1021
02:14:31,809 --> 02:14:32,833
You'll get into trouble.

1022
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:34,609
If anything happens to you
in that trouble.

1023
02:14:36,313 --> 02:14:38,076
I and your sister-in-law can't bear it.

1024
02:14:38,516 --> 02:14:39,414
We can't.

1025
02:14:39,917 --> 02:14:43,819
How did you get hurt? How many
times I've to tell you to stay out?

1026
02:14:44,522 --> 02:14:51,485
Once when you asked sister-in-law
about not feeling like having children,

1027
02:14:52,730 --> 02:14:54,595
I know how much it hurt her,

1028
02:14:55,199 --> 02:14:57,099
Didn't you ever feel like having
children, sister-in-law?

1029
02:15:00,771 --> 02:15:04,832
Unable to tell you we're not having
children because of this problem,

1030
02:15:05,509 --> 02:15:06,942
and unable to hide it in heart,

1031
02:15:07,545 --> 02:15:09,445
we've been seeing hell
for the past 11 years.

1032
02:15:11,782 --> 02:15:13,340
I've managed to save you till now,

1033
02:15:14,452 --> 02:15:21,187
but I've been given the
task of killing you.

1034
02:15:21,792 --> 02:15:22,451
Me?

1035
02:15:25,096 --> 02:15:25,687
Reason?

1036
02:15:34,505 --> 02:15:38,339
Where is he?
- No brother. Don't know about him.

1037
02:15:38,509 --> 02:15:41,205
You know about me, right?
- No brother.

1038
02:15:41,946 --> 02:15:43,311
Why should we fear him?

1039
02:15:47,818 --> 02:15:54,621
We should make him shiver in fear.

1040
02:15:55,693 --> 02:15:56,785
They'll kill us.

1041
02:15:58,295 --> 02:15:59,387
What if we kill them?

1042
02:16:08,005 --> 02:16:10,371
You've brought your brother to me.

1043
02:16:14,411 --> 02:16:19,508
I didn't bring my brother here.
He brought me here.

1044
02:16:33,464 --> 02:16:38,401
I've lost money, reputation and
business because of you.

1045
02:16:38,636 --> 02:16:40,035
Now you'll lose your life.

1046
02:16:41,739 --> 02:16:42,364
How would you kill me?

1047
02:17:40,598 --> 02:17:41,656
Dreaming?

1048
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:44,458
No, calculating time to complete it.

1049
02:17:45,369 --> 02:17:46,063
8 people...

1050
02:18:28,412 --> 02:18:31,609
If I sell she'll fetch Rs.2 crores.
Isn't it Rajiv?

1051
02:18:32,716 --> 02:18:36,208
You beat my people and
saved an unknown girl.

1052
02:18:36,387 --> 02:18:36,876
Today...

1053
02:18:41,492 --> 02:18:42,322
Why are you smiling?

1054
02:18:43,227 --> 02:18:47,857
Nothing, what would become
of you without that crutch?

1055
02:19:01,412 --> 02:19:03,175
Do you know how I lost my leg?

1056
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:06,515
Kill me if you want to,
don't tell stories.

1057
02:19:20,531 --> 02:19:21,589
Do you know who am I?

1058
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:26,226
You've pointed a gun,
we've been introduced.

1059
02:19:27,805 --> 02:19:29,705
Why do I like him?

1060
02:19:31,075 --> 02:19:33,168
He's very useful to our business.

1061
02:19:34,111 --> 02:19:37,103
Your brother is dead and
my brother too is dead.

1062
02:19:39,216 --> 02:19:40,877
Why should his brother live?

1063
02:19:42,086 --> 02:19:42,745
Kill him, Kelly.

1064
02:19:56,133 --> 02:19:56,758
Kill him, Kelly.

1065
02:19:59,636 --> 02:20:02,230
Okay, I'll give you 2 options,

1066
02:20:03,941 --> 02:20:05,704
would like to die after lighting cigar?

1067
02:20:07,778 --> 02:20:09,575
Or die without lighting the cigar?

1068
02:22:13,370 --> 02:22:14,928
Didn't you expect I would come?

1069
02:22:26,283 --> 02:22:29,116
The day Ria introduced you
as her boy friend,

1070
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:35,119
I wanted to kill you using brain
not in a burst of anger.

1071
02:22:35,792 --> 02:22:38,352
Wasted paying a crore to RD.

1072
02:22:42,366 --> 02:22:43,128
Kill him.

1073
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:45,267
The drama I played is waste.

1074
02:24:25,102 --> 02:24:28,697
I'll do anything to deny you Ria.

1075
02:26:35,665 --> 02:26:36,654
When did you learn to swim?

1076
02:26:37,701 --> 02:26:38,725
Who told you I can't swim?

1077
02:26:39,836 --> 02:26:40,734
Then, that day?

1078
02:26:42,706 --> 02:26:46,506
Would anyone say I know to swim
when a beautiful girl is saving?

1079
02:26:50,347 --> 02:26:52,542
Okay, I'll give you 2 options,

1080
02:26:53,550 --> 02:26:56,041
shall we go home and sing a song
or sing a song and go home?

1081
02:26:59,022 --> 02:27:00,114
Let's go home singing a song.
