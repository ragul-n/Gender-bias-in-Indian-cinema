1
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:03,750
It is darkness that has

2
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,541
surrounded all the planets.

3
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:13,250
The darkness has surrounded the planets,
not brightness.

4
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,833
Brightness comes,
where there's no darkness.

5
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,125
Darkness gives birth to brightness.

6
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,833
Darkness is the ultimate truth.

7
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:28,958
From a human being's mind to the
world he sees, she's the only Goddess.

8
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,541
That is darkness.

9
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,125
Her image is horrendous.

10
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,333
But it is very beautiful,
like a lotus flower.

11
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:47,333
She's an artist.
She's very beautiful and delicate.

12
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:53,916
She's the incarnation of Goddess Kali.

13
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,541
The one who overcomes
all the situations of life

14
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:01,500
in the form of Goddess Kali is, Urvi.

15
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,541
Father.

16
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,541
Father, I'll pull it.

17
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,791
Come, my child.

18
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,583
-Pull.
-Father.

19
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,458
-Sister.
-Pull when the tide comes.

20
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,000
Come on, pull.

21
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,291
Pull, my child, pull!

22
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,250
Here comes the tide.

23
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:36,750
Pull! Pull!
Here we go!

24
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:41,375
-Come on, push.
-Harder.

25
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,791
It's quite a boring day today.

26
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,166
Pull, my child, pull.

27
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:56,041
Look at that beautiful fish
from the sea, who's that?

28
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,000
That's the chocolate from Naani's box.
Did you forget, boss?

29
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,000
Come on!

30
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,625
Can I help you?

31
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,166
-Don't be shy.
-Father!

32
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,458
Wait!
Hey!

33
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,333
Parvathi, go home.

34
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,541
Okay, father.

35
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,583
Oh no!

36
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:31,750
Hey, be careful.

37
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,541
Don't look there.
Look at me.

38
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,458
How have you been, Naani?

39
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,083
I've borrowed money from you.
How do you expect me to be?

40
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,083
Please give me some time.

41
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,041
Careful. In the search of
the depths of an ocean

42
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,208
you might get stuck
in the fishnet of God...

43
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,208
and you would become a fool.

44
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,291
I have an idea!

45
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,250
Didn't you understand, Naani?

46
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,208
I'll waiver off your loans.

47
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,000
I will even buy you two boats

48
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,083
and make you, the king of the sea!

49
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,458
No, wait!

50
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,125
I am the king.
I'll make you the minister.

51
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:26,750
Look...

52
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,458
just make your
daughter sit on my lap.

53
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,875
Just once, please.

54
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:32,875
Bastard!

55
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,208
-Hey, stop!
-Father!

56
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,666
Do you think he'll send us his
daughter if you kick him?

57
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,791
Stop it.
Leave him.

58
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,708
We don't even dare to look into the eyes
of our elders, how dare you to kick him?

59
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,958
Hey, get up.

60
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,166
Naani, one hit and you're down?

61
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,083
Stand up, Naani.
Get up.

62
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,708
Our hearts should be marked
with love prints, not footprints.

63
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,625
Up, up, up.
Get up.

64
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,791
Leave.

65
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:13,666
Hey, Naani!
Don't forget our agreement.

66
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,458
Look how they've beaten you without
even considering your age.

67
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,208
They're pure evil.

68
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,250
Let me apply some balm.

69
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't want to get married.

70
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,916
I'm tired of living like this.

71
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,833
Let's just go away from here.

72
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,708
No, I can't be at peace
until I return his money.

73
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,958
I'm the one who took his
slap in the face.

74
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,958
I won't rest until I don't
give him back his money.

75
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,291
Stop worrying.
You're the bride-to-be.

76
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,958
Don't

77
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,458
Get some sleep.

78
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,583
You shut me up every time.

79
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,041
Do what suits you.

80
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,208
Don't worry, my dear.

81
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,458
Hey, Nani!
What a lucky day!

82
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:15,291
If I knew that you were coming,
I wouldn't have showered!

83
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,375
Your very presence cleanses me.

84
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,625
Isn't it?

85
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,708
Take her.

86
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,041
My baby, come to me.

87
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,375
Careful.

88
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,875
Come in.

89
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,000
Come, sit.

90
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,458
What's the matter?

91
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,458
Here's your money, with the interest.

92
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,958
What!

93
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,208
What a beautiful morning.

94
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,625
I feel like Goddess Parvathi is
right in front of my eyes.

95
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,458
Take it.

96
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,708
Get him some juice.
The expensive one, from Dubai.

97
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,458
-Go, get it!
-Okay.

98
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,166
-Hey! Don't forget the ice cubes.
-Okay, sir.

99
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,291
It'll cool your head.

100
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,208
Hey! Sit, sit.

101
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:23,083
Naani, do you know?

102
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,041
We borrow fish from the sea.

103
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,291
But can it ever be repaid?

104
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,958
The air that we breathe,
can that be repaid?

105
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:40,083
The sunlight? Seems like you're trying
to trap the sun in to the torch.

106
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,750
Aren't you?

107
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,416
-Boss, juice.
-Give it to sir.

108
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,208
Please take it.

109
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,541
-Did you put ice cubes?
-Yes, boss.

110
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,791
Drink it.

111
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:09,166
Enough now!
Put the glass down.

112
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,916
Get out.

113
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,000
Give me that.
You fool!

114
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,125
The loan documents--

115
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:35,958
Death.

116
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,833
Death usually strikes
one from the back.

117
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,958
You have chosen to confront it.

118
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,875
Your wish is my command.

119
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,583
Did you see the same dream again?

120
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,125
They say,
you're supposed to work in the day and

121
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,125
rest and dream in the night.

122
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,333
Suzie, darling...

123
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,166
it's been years since we
slept at night, right?

124
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,041
How in the world can
we dream of something new?

125
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,208
C'mon, get up!

126
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,500
There's a lot of money
flowing downstairs.

127
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,958
Let's bring it up
and tie it to our beds.

128
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,916
Get up now.
Let's tie them up!

129
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,458
Darkness.

130
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:42,250
We need light to illuminate our path,
we need darkness to induce sleep.

131
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:47,500
Light for laughter and suffering.

132
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:55,166
Brightness to look
and darkness to feel shy.

133
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:08,458
"It's an ocean of melodious music"

134
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:13,625
"The brothel is filled
With immortal romance"

135
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:18,708
"The night has decked up"

136
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:23,791
"Come to watch, the dance of the night"

137
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,791
"It is the fragrance of desires"

138
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,041
"Come to experience the shyness"

139
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:39,166
"There's fragrance
Of romance everywhere"

140
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:44,166
"Come to me without wasting time"

141
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:49,333
"The romance is at its peak"

142
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:55,875
"Let's romance,
The rain is driving me crazy"

143
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,166
"It's an ocean of melodious music"

144
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,291
"The brothel is filled
With immortal romance"

145
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:45,541
"The lamp of music has been doused"

146
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:50,541
"The restless eyes are tormenting me"

147
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,750
"The falling dewdrops"

148
00:15:55,916 --> 00:16:00,791
"There is sadness in me"

149
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
"I have developed a feeling"

150
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:11,083
"It's a true feeling"

151
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:15,958
"I'm a married woman who's been rejected"

152
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:21,250
"It's an ocean of melodious music"

153
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:26,458
"The brothel is filled
With immortal romance"

154
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:31,458
"The night has decked up"

155
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:36,500
"Come to watch, the dance of the night"

156
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,708
"It is the fragrance of desires"

157
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:46,750
"Come to experience the shyness"

158
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:51,958
"There's fragrance
Of romance everywhere"

159
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:57,000
"Come to me without wasting time"

160
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,416
"The romance is at its peak"

161
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Bobby, I want that young girl.

162
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,333
Hey!

163
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,125
"The rain is driving me crazy"

164
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,458
Robin!

165
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,583
Bastard!

166
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:22,250
Bobby, I want him out right now!

167
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:27,666
Not bad. I have tamed many but
she has got some super power.

168
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,375
Bobby, I want her.
And I'm not going without her!

169
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,833
If somebody is deflowering her,
that'll be me!

170
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,625
-Son of a bitch!
-Hey!

171
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,333
Get lost!

172
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,166
You will face the
consequences, Bobby.

173
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,250
Give her to me.

174
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,833
C'mon, kid. Time to go home.

175
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:42,833
Let's go, man!

176
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,500
C'mon boy, I've seen many like you.

177
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,166
Do you think, I'll not find her
out on the streets?

178
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,416
You bastard, you take my money
and send me empty handed?

179
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:56,000
Why did you dance when we were dancing?

180
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,625
I will break your limbs.

181
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,958
I've told you not to come
here while we're dancing.

182
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,916
Look what happened now.

183
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,000
What if he does something to you
while you're returning from school?

184
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,458
Come on, kid. Let's go.

185
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,166
Hey, where are you taking her?

186
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,541
Don't block
the path of the kids' future, Daisy.

187
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,416
Take it easy.
Bobby is looking for you.

188
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,500
-Don't worry about it, kid.
-Give me my stole.

189
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:19,791
Catch it.

190
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,208
-Don't stop dancing, kid.
-Daisy.

191
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,916
As the days pass by,
we need to protect Rashmi more.

192
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,125
It's like the tongue stuck
in between the teeth.

193
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,291
It gets bitten, wherever it goes.

194
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,666
Right?

195
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,500
Believe in God.
He'll take care.

196
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,416
Suzie.

197
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,125
Once the tongue turns against the teeth,
all of them are destined to fall.

198
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,083
That's how I'll raise her.
You wait and watch.

199
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:56,875
Daisy.

200
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,416
You've really learnt to talk well.

201
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,958
I'm very happy.

202
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,625
But, Daisy...

203
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,291
I'll tell you one thing.

204
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,000
We can get angry if
nobody is looking at us.

205
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,250
But...

206
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:19,250
if someone enjoys looking at us,
why should we get angry?

207
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,125
You're the future madam of this house.

208
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,208
We can cheat our hearts,
it's not a sin.

209
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:38,208
But, injustice to the bed is a sin.

210
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,916
Professional ethics!

211
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,208
Hope you have understood.

212
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,333
Bobby.

213
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:53,416
You want to drag every
blooming flower to the bed.

214
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,500
But some flowers bloom for God.

215
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,583
If you dare touch them

216
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,625
the thorns around it, will prick you.

217
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,041
Nature ethics.

218
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,291
I'll see you.

219
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,125
Kids.

220
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,166
Sir, we can clearly see
what the minister has done.

221
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:09,333
The minister raised
his hands on a farmer...

222
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,500
Move aside.

223
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:15,208
How can you put such allegations
on him?

224
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,708
Is this justice?
Sir, answer us.

225
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,958
Audience, should we encourage
such a revolutionary act

226
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,333
or should we help the police?

227
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:26,041
What is your opinion?
With cameraman, Shivakumar, Umesh.

228
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:30,291
Move back, everyone.

229
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,791
A new revolution against
corruption by an artist.

230
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,041
The corrupts' truth is exposed on

231
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,250
their walls, in the form of graffiti.

232
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,458
The artist drew the
graffiti last night.

233
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:47,958
Hey, switch it back.

234
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:48,875
Suzie.

235
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,375
I want to watch.

236
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,250
If you keep watching this,
I'll go watch TV in Bobby's room.

237
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,500
Wait a minute.

238
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,791
Look at him, Rashmi.

239
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,000
When he can paint the garbage
of the society so well...

240
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,541
imagine what would he do
if he encountered real beauty.

241
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,875
What?

242
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,625
I mean...

243
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:12,166
when he can see the colors
so beautifully in the night...

244
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,958
imagine how beautiful the colors
would look to him in the day.

245
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,041
You keep on dreaming.

246
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,458
I'll go to Bobby's room and watch TV.

247
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,000
Alright, go.

248
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,500
It is rare for us to
dream of a man like that.

249
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,333
The Gods are seldom on our side.

250
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:34,166
I'll bring him along.
You'll see.

251
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,791
Watch our exclusive 'Those eyes'.

252
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:42,708
"Those eyes"

253
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:46,333
"Those eyes."

254
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,375
"It is battling with me"

255
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,791
Easy.

256
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,625
Just a minute. Sorry!

257
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:04,583
-Did you see anyone wearing a mask?
-I saw nobody. Keep walking.

258
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,458
Wow.

259
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,416
Easy.

260
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,541
The beauty should always stay quiet...

261
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,750
and let the spectators talk.

262
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:23,541
Wow!

263
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,291
Roaring whispers.

264
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
A good artist finding a great beauty is
the law of nature.

265
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:41,000
Wherever I go, whatever I see,
whatever I do...

266
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,708
I'll only find your beauty.

267
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,875
I'll have to thank God.
See you.

268
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,791
-Dad, how's everyone back home?
-Shweta!

269
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,416
-Everyone's fine.
-Shweta!

270
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,041
Hi, Asha.

271
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,083
-Hi!
-Hi!

272
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,750
-Hello, uncle!
-Hello.

273
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:25,041
Dad, this is Asha. My senior.
I've mentioned her sometimes.

274
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,750
Not sometimes, love.

275
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:32,125
You talk about her all the time.

276
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,333
Growing up in our orphanage...

277
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,375
and looking at your fights
for women rights...

278
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,458
she praises you even in her sleep.

279
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,458
You live in our orphanage.

280
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:49,291
I would be very happy if you
take up the admin responsibilities.

281
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:53,000
No, uncle.
Shweta is good in administration.

282
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,250
Asha.

283
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:57,875
More than anything, she's so blessed
to have a father like you.

284
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:02,083
Your words flatter me.

285
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,416
God bless you.

286
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,250
I'll take your leave, uncle.
I'm getting late.

287
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,375
Okay, bye.

288
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:10,750
-See you.
-Who's that?

289
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,541
He is my friend.

290
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,708
Is he my future son-in-law?

291
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,541
-God bless you, child. Carry on.
-Thank you. Bye.

292
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,083
I will see you later.

293
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,041
Okay. I'll get going now.

294
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,416
Come on!

295
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,416
You seem to have good contacts.

296
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:29,583
Who's the hotshot?

297
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,291
My friend's father.

298
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,916
Why do you want to know everything?

299
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,333
Let's go.

300
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,625
So, should I leave now?

301
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:42,000
Dad, please let me come
home with you.

302
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:47,208
Amidst all all these buildings, I
can't even see the sun rise and set.

303
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:51,500
I want to go sit
on the seashores, until I'm bored.

304
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,000
There's nothing over there, child.

305
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:56,708
The same old sea. The same old waves
and the same old dirt.

306
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,083
Here, there is no difference between
the night and the day.

307
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:00,750
You'll be happy here, love.

308
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:07,083
Do you want money?
Here you go.

309
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,791
Use this for your college fees
as well as for other things.

310
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,875
Okay, love.
I'll get going now.

311
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,791
One day, I'll come uninvited.

312
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,958
You won't be able to stop me then.

313
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,125
Oh!

314
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:22,000
Don't do that.
Please don't do such things.

315
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:29,916
Dad, even a tiger has
time for its children in the jungle.

316
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,958
But you're always busy.

317
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,333
Look, love.

318
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,458
I'll go today.

319
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:40,708
The next time, I'll stay here
for an entire month. Okay?

320
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,041
Bye, my child.

321
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,333
-Hey, let's go.
-Okay, boss.

322
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,333
Bye, my child. Bye.

323
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:04,250
Coffee.

324
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,708
Did you get started again?

325
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,416
-Coffee?
-Wait a second.

326
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:19,166
Prakash,
look at the statistics.

327
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,916
It shows the number of women
who've gone through abuse.

328
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,708
People have become beasts.

329
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,666
I wonder how someone can be so inhuman.

330
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,416
We have to do something to these devils.

331
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,583
They need to be punished.

332
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,625
Look, Asha...

333
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:37,541
if you make up your mind,
I'll take you to London with me.

334
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,333
We'll do something,
settle down there.

335
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:43,541
Then you won't have to worry
about such things there.

336
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:45,000
Think of it.

337
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,666
I don't think so, Prakash.

338
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:51,166
Whichever country you go to,
a girl's life is not so different.

339
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,375
More than anything else

340
00:28:55,583 --> 00:29:00,750
the orphanage has
always supported me

341
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,708
and backed me up for education.

342
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,833
What I'm doing in return is
a small compromise.

343
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,541
Look.

344
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:12,708
I'd be the first ever
doctor from my orphanage.

345
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:17,333
I can't let go of this
and come with you.

346
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:21,791
Disappointing them won't be right.

347
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:26,416
Give me some time and after that
the whole world will be ours.

348
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:29,833
Look, doctor...

349
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:34,375
I'm like the mixture of all
the precious stones.

350
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,541
Your orphanage can't find
a better guy than me.

351
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,375
Tell them about our marriage.

352
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,583
They'll send you off happily.

353
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,083
-Phone.
-Oh!

354
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,125
-Come back soon.
-Just two minutes. I'll be quick.

355
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,291
Okay, bye.

356
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:20,541
-Done?
-Asha.

357
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:22,291
My queen.

358
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,708
Shall we go?

359
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:55,333
"There's love in the air"

360
00:30:55,625 --> 00:31:00,416
"The dewdrop has come to feel me"

361
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:05,541
"The smiling eyes speak"

362
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:10,958
"I have forgotten myself"

363
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:15,958
"I have lost before love"

364
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:20,708
"Life has become new"

365
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:26,083
"Every word has become a song"

366
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:30,958
"The silence has become so pleasurable"

367
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:35,208
"There's love in the air"

368
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:41,083
"The dewdrop has come to feel me"

369
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:10,875
"In the pretext to say something"

370
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:16,208
"Why do you yearn to see only me?"

371
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:21,750
"The happiness on your face"

372
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,166
"Why are you so excited?"

373
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:32,166
"There's so much love in my heart"

374
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:37,000
"Your talks are decked with music"

375
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:41,500
"Love is God"

376
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:46,541
"There's love in the air"

377
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:51,791
"The dewdrop has come to feel me"

378
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,833
"The smiling eyes speak"

379
00:32:56,916 --> 00:33:02,291
"I have forgotten myself"

380
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,083
-Asha.
-Yes?

381
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:06,583
It's getting late.

382
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,250
I don't even have my car to drop
you off today.

383
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,250
-Sorry.
-You better leave. It's already dark.

384
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,416
Yes, uncle.
I'll get going.

385
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,875
I didn't realize it got so late.

386
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,333
Uncle, could you please pick me
up from the orphanage tomorrow?

387
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:18,708
-Okay, I'll try.
-Okay.

388
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,166
-Sorry.
-Hurry up, now.

389
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,166
Who does it belong to?

390
00:34:56,833 --> 00:35:02,291
Oh my God!
That's a lot of money!

391
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,833
Who could have left it here?

392
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:20,375
Uncle!

393
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,583
-Uncle.
-Yes?

394
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:24,541
-I found this purse.
-Purse?

395
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,125
-It doesn't have an ID.
-Is it? Let me see.

396
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,250
There's too much money in it.

397
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,250
Money?

398
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,250
What are you saying?

399
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:33,541
-Oh!
-I can't trust the police.

400
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:36,083
What if this belongs to someone in need?

401
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,875
But...

402
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:41,500
If there's so much money,
it could belong to someone around here.

403
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,416
They'll definitely come back for it.

404
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
-Let's wait for a day or two and see.
-Okay.

405
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:47,958
If somebody comes asking for it,
I'll tell you.

406
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,125
Until then, keep this with you.
Careful.

407
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:51,750
It's a lot of money.

408
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,208
What if nobody turns up?

409
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,833
What do we do then?

410
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,875
I'll give it to my orphanage.

411
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,625
-They'll use it for the right cause.
-Good idea.

412
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,625
Do that.
You should get going now.

413
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,625
Be careful about the money.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.

414
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,625
-Okay, be careful!
-Okay, bye.

415
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,458
Madam.

416
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:23,166
Hello, madam.

417
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,333
Madam.

418
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Madam, one minute.
Please wait.

419
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:29,875
Madam.

420
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,333
Madam.

421
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,208
Why are you following me?

422
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,041
Please don't misunderstand me.

423
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:39,583
I had forgotten my bag in the library.

424
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,708
I saw you walking out of the library.

425
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,916
I just wanted to check with you,
if you saw a small bag.

426
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:48,125
Black in color and
I had kept a little money in it.

427
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,291
I didn't know how to ask you.

428
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,250
Please don't mind.

429
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:54,125
Sir, sir, I'm so sorry.

430
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,916
There was too much money in it.
I didn't know what to do.

431
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,958
I was going to give it to the police.

432
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,416
Please take your bag.
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

433
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:03,000
Why are you apologizing, madam?

434
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,708
It's my mistake that
I forgot the bag.

435
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,708
I'm happy that I found the money.

436
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,375
If some crooks had found it

437
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,208
I would've lost it all.

438
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:13,916
Anyway, it was a huge help.
Thanks, madam.

439
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,250
Thank you very much.

440
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,750
Sir, please count it.

441
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:20,750
It's alright, madam.

442
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,625
I trust you.
It's okay.

443
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:23,833
It's not about trust, sir.

444
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,708
You don't even know me.

445
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:26,916
Please count.

446
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,458
Okay, fine.
Let me count.

447
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,375
Madam, where's the rest?

448
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:40,875
The rest?
What do you mean?

449
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,750
Please don't play with me, madam.

450
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:48,333
Yes, it's my mistake.
But please don't do this to me.

451
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:49,875
Please give me the remaining amount.

452
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,916
Sir, it only had this much money.

453
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:55,291
I had counted it.
A hundred and fifty thousand rupees.

454
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:57,291
There are only two bundles here.

455
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:58,333
One is missing.

456
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,333
-Sir--
-Please don't do this to me.

457
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,250
I've struggled a lot to earn this.

458
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,708
-Please, please.
-Sir, what is wrong with you?

459
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:07,166
I found this and I have
no idea about the rest.

460
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:10,291
If you found this bag

461
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,458
all the money
should be with you.

462
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:19,166
I'm respecting the fact that you're a
woman but you're acting too smart.

463
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:22,750
Sir, I'm returning this to you
the way I found it.

464
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:24,916
If you want to argue,
let's go to the police station.

465
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,833
Okay, let's go to the police station.

466
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:32,333
You say what you have to
and I'll tell the truth.

467
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:33,458
Okay.
Lets settle it there.

468
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,541
I don't want to argue on the streets.

469
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:57,791
Sir...

470
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,916
Miss, according to him, you're the thief.

471
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,583
He's lying, sir.

472
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,291
I am telling you the truth.

473
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:11,791
Sir, she's just cooking up a story.

474
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:13,875
Why would I steal from my own purse?

475
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,208
-What a beautiful story!
-Hey! Wait a minute.

476
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:21,250
Look, miss.

477
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:24,958
Were you the one who first
saw this purse?

478
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,125
If she says no, I'll walk right away.

479
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:30,083
Wait, mister.
I'm talking to her.

480
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:31,541
Tell me, miss.

481
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:35,208
Is it true that you found
money in the purse?

482
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,250
If she says no,
I swear I'll walk away right now.

483
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:40,791
If you keep acting like this

484
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:42,833
I swear I'll break your bones
and put you behind the bars.

485
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:44,750
Okay, sir.
Sorry.

486
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:45,791
Tell me.

487
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,333
When you picked up the purse,
did you find the money in it?

488
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,125
Yes, sir.

489
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:55,375
First you said no, now you're saying yes.

490
00:39:56,083 --> 00:40:00,250
Are you alone?
Why don't you call your folks?

491
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:03,750
Sir, I don't have anyone.

492
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:10,166
I was brought up in an orphanage
near Kuvempu Nagar.

493
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,708
Now I know.

494
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:27,083
See, she's an orphan.
She has nobody.

495
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:31,375
-Sir.
-Where will her pocket money come from?

496
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,375
Good point, sir.

497
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:33,333
Exactly.

498
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,791
Sir, please.
I'm a medical student.

499
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,083
That makes you even more
desperate for money.

500
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:43,583
-Rajamma, file an FIR on this girl.
-Sir.

501
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:45,333
-Okay, sir.
-Sir!

502
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:47,583
Let this case be solved in the court.

503
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,666
Doesn't look like
we can settle with words here.

504
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,708
Sir, please don't be ridiculous.

505
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:54,333
Please come to my orphanage or college,
and run a background check.

506
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:55,916
They'll tell you about me.

507
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,750
What? Ridiculous?

508
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,833
Alright. Why don't you bring them
all to the court?

509
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:03,666
Let's see what they have to say.

510
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:05,916
I might find some more criminals.

511
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,166
Sir...

512
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,083
-Rajamma.
-Sir.

513
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,708
How many times do I have to
tell you to file the FIR?

514
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,166
Don't you understand?

515
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,166
-What am I here for, to fool around?
- I'll do it right away, sir.

516
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,375
-Please listen to me, sir.
-Look.

517
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,791
I don't have money to roam around
the court and fight the case.

518
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,291
She has to bare my expenses as well.

519
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:33,125
-You want 50,000, right?
-That is all.

520
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:35,000
It's all right, miss.

521
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,333
Get a lawyer and fight the case.

522
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:40,458
If you win the case
after six months or a year.

523
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:43,791
I'll get your money from this
crook, including the interest.

524
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:48,083
Sir, it's alright.
I'll manage to source in 50,000.

525
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,833
But please don't file an FIR.

526
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:56,041
It'll ruin my career.
Please, sir. Please.

527
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:58,083
Why are you thinking about it now?

528
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,958
Why did you think about it
when you flicked the purse?

529
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:04,500
Are you okay with this?

530
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:07,416
Okay, sir.
I just want my money back.

531
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,041
Give her a day or two.

532
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,458
She'll return your money.

533
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:14,541
You return his money
as soon as you can.

534
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,583
Okay?

535
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:21,041
Women can't have money
unless it's given to them.

536
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,666
You shouldn't even
dare to look at others.

537
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,250
Okay?

538
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:28,208
You people may leave now.
Y'all settle it.

539
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,958
Thank you, sir.
Bye.

540
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,166
I'll manage to source 50,000.

541
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:16,500
But please don't file an FIR.

542
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:19,208
It will ruin my career.

543
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,583
-Hello.
-Hello, Prakash.

544
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:41,625
What's up, Asha, my love?

545
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,375
Missing me already?

546
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:47,083
-Prakash.
-Yes, madam.

547
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,375
I have to ask--

548
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,041
What happened?

549
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:57,291
Prakash, the world is too cruel.

550
00:43:58,208 --> 00:43:59,958
You better be careful.

551
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:02,333
Don't trust anyone.
Okay?

552
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:07,666
Asha, when you're with me,
nobody can harm me.

553
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:11,625
So, don't you worry.
I'm all set to get my visa.

554
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,333
Now give me a kiss.

555
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:17,208
Your kiss is my bodyguard.

556
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:23,541
Prakash, you mean everything to me.

557
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:25,541
I know that, love.

558
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:27,708
Please, don't leave me.

559
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,125
Why? Any problem?

560
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:37,125
Nothing.
Just like that.

561
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,416
I miss you.

562
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,708
I miss you too, love.

563
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:42,916
Please come back soon.

564
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,583
Okay, I'll come back soon.

565
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:48,666
Now where is my kiss?
Come on, come on, please.

566
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,125
-Love you. Bye.
-Bye.

567
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,541
Hi, Shweta.

568
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:04,666
Hi.

569
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:10,833
-Hi.
-Hi, how are you?

570
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,125
-Did you eat your breakfast?
-Yes.

571
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:15,833
Here's the money you had asked for.

572
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,375
Thank you.
This is a huge favor.

573
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:20,833
It's alright.

574
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,750
If you don't mind, may I
ask what do you need it for?

575
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:26,583
I... need it.

576
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,833
I shall return it as soon as I can.

577
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:30,791
Don't treat me like a stranger
by talking about returning the money.

578
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,958
I'm giving it to my sister.

579
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:37,125
-Thank you.
-Come on, you don't have to thank me.

580
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,000
Come.

581
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:47,708
Hello.

582
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:49,708
Hello, sir.
Where should I bring the money?

583
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,000
Oh! Do you already have the money?

584
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,916
Do one thing!

585
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,666
Bring it to Parimala Lodge in Hebbala.

586
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:56,708
To a lodge?

587
00:45:56,791 --> 00:46:00,291
Yes, around 08:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
I'll finish my work and come meet you.

588
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:02,916
Sir, I can't make it that late.
Please come a little early.

589
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,583
What's wrong with you?

590
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:07,041
These days girls walk
around freely all night.

591
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:10,000
And you say 08:00 p.m - 08:30 p.m is late?
I'll try to come as soon as I can.

592
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:11,750
Hello? Hello!

593
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:27,833
You already got thrashed
and you're here again?

594
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:28,916
Manja, it's true.

595
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,166
One has to go back
to his wife, one day.

596
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,625
Things didn't workout anywhere else.

597
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,541
So, I have come to your lodge.

598
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,875
You can even go to other places.

599
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,750
Stop it.

600
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:43,208
By the way, who's that?

601
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:44,708
Never seen this beauty before.

602
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:47,541
Is she new?
Is she available?

603
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:49,666
Wait, dude.
Don't disturb me.

604
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,250
Damn!
He's not answering.

605
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:24,666
Hello.

606
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,666
Sir! Sir!

607
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,666
Where are you?

608
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,750
I'm right here in the lodge.

609
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:30,541
I've been waiting.
Where are you, sir?

610
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:33,083
Come out.
I'm waiting at the gate.

611
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:34,875
I'll be right there.

612
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:37,541
Dude, she's fast.

613
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:39,041
She found a customer already.

614
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:41,583
Finally the police is here.

615
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:47,083
Police.

616
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:48,791
Where are you going?

617
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:51,125
Get in!
Get in!

618
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:53,000
Why?
What did I do?

619
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:54,458
Sit! Sit down!
Shut up!

620
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:55,666
Hello.
Where are you?

621
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,958
Wait, I'm coming right away.

622
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,875
Let me go. I have to go out.
What did I do?

623
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:02,166
So this is what you students
are up-to these days.

624
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,375
Is this what your parents taught you?

625
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:05,000
-I haven't done anything.
-Be quiet.

626
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,791
Why are you hitting me?

627
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:09,250
-I've seen many like you.
-I'm innocent.

628
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,291
Everyone who does this,
says the same.

629
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:15,750
Check the other side.

630
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,375
Yes, okay.

631
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:20,708
Hey, open the door.

632
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,958
Open it.

633
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,125
Hey, come back.
Stop right there.

634
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:27,208
Get out of the room.

635
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:33,625
Come out, with us.

636
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,583
We'll break your bones
in the cell. Keep walking.

637
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:40,000
All of you, keep walking!
Hurry.

638
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:42,625
Did you get everyone?

639
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:43,833
Yes, I did.

640
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:45,041
Are you sure?

641
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:46,958
-Yes.
-Take all of them to the police van.

642
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:54,166
All of you, get in.
Hurry now. Get in.

643
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:56,416
Come on.

644
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:58,125
-Madam, please.
- Come on.

645
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:01,333
I am not involved in this activity.

646
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:05,041
Please let me go.

647
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,291
Shut up and get in.

648
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:11,708
Sir, please.
Please help me.

649
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,125
Boss, please give me your phone.

650
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:26,250
Here. Be quick.
Madam, is the inspector coming?

651
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:27,416
Yes, he is.

652
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,166
Hey.
Be quick.

653
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,750
Come on, boss.
I gave you money.

654
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,875
I said we should go to Ambika but
you said Parimala.

655
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,708
Now see what happened.

656
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:38,416
I shouldn't have listened to you.

657
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:51,958
Who are these people?
Manja's girls?

658
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:53,666
He's here.
Give me my phone.

659
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:58,291
Sir, she's been coming to
the Parimala lodge for two days.

660
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:02,583
I checked her bag and found
50 thousand rupees in it.

661
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:07,750
It's His blessings.

662
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:11,791
Sir...

663
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:18,208
Oh! All I asked you was to
pay him his money.

664
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:19,791
Why did you go to sell your body?

665
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:22,750
I didn't do anything of that sort, sir.
I was just...

666
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:25,625
Hey, you should be ashamed of yourself.

667
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:31,250
Why didn't you ask me for the money.
I could've taken care of it.

668
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:33,791
Sir, please.
Mind your language.

669
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:36,166
What?

670
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:40,875
Sir, you... you didn't
listen to me the other day.

671
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,291
You aren't even today!

672
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,958
What have I done to you?

673
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,791
Please let me go.

674
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:48,541
I beg you, sir, please.

675
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:52,208
If it was just about the money...

676
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:53,958
I would've let you go.
I swear!

677
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:55,041
Sir!

678
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:57,416
But...

679
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:00,583
But you know why I went there, sir.

680
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,916
Why are you pretending to know nothing?

681
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,791
I'm going home now.

682
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,416
-Let her wait. We'll see.
-Sir, please.

683
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:12,541
Sir, please listen to me.

684
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:14,916
Hey!
Shut up and sit down.

685
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:31,083
-We'll come back tomorrow.
-Yes, alright.

686
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:33,125
Hello, sister. How's your husband?

687
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:34,875
-What a jerk.
- Hello, Ganesh!

688
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,083
-Hey!
-Fix your hat!

689
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:38,666
It's okay.

690
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:41,041
Look at you all!

691
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:44,791
They called you and
you came running along. Bitches!

692
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:46,791
Hello, madam.

693
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:47,708
Yes, Manja.

694
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:50,083
As soon as the boss steps out,
she acts like the queen.

695
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:56,250
Your money.

696
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,750
Okay, take this as well.

697
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,208
I spoke to the boss about my girls.

698
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:05,958
Alright,
take them.

699
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:07,041
Okay, madam.

700
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,708
Go to hell.

701
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:10,791
Hey, stand tall man.

702
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:14,666
Manja, take this girl along.

703
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:17,416
Madam, she's not ours.

704
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,083
Looks like a decent one.

705
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:22,125
Seems like you picked her up by mistake.

706
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,625
Okay, send her.

707
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,625
Are you ordering me?

708
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:27,375
No, madam. Sorry.

709
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,791
Poor girl,
she isn't one of ours.

710
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:31,833
Please send her along.

711
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:32,833
Hey, go with him.

712
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:34,166
Okay, come along.

713
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:37,000
What are you waiting for, Christmas?

714
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:38,291
Let's go.

715
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,833
-Can I go? Really?
-I said go.

716
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:46,666
What are you all waiting for? Let's go.

717
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,666
The car's ready.

718
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:49,166
Bro, what about us?

719
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,666
Hey, step back.

720
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:52,916
Hey, constable!
Take good care of these boys.

721
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,958
Come with me.

722
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,791
Hurry up, girls.
I'm running late.

723
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,541
You're acting like
you've come to your parents' home.

724
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:03,125
I always have to come
back to fetch you all.

725
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:04,916
You go in the back.

726
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,333
-You sit over here.
-Excuse me!

727
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,333
Yes? Do you need something?

728
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,708
Thank you very much
for your help, sir.

729
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:14,625
That's alright.
This is nothing new to us.

730
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:18,166
But girls like you shouldn't
go to such places.

731
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:22,416
If you don't mind, come with us.
I'll drop you off.

732
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,833
It's alright, sir.
I'll go. It's okay.

733
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:27,750
No, please think about it.

734
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,208
There have been too many
rape cases lately.

735
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:31,833
Look, madam.

736
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:36,291
I'm also into social service.
About this...

737
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,083
I had no choice.

738
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,208
Once you're in, you can neither
stay, nor leave.

739
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:44,041
Had to take it up to earn my
bread and butter.

740
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:46,000
Think of me as your brother.

741
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:47,500
Please trust me.

742
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:50,333
You seem to be a nice girl
I'll drop you. Please come.

743
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,583
Hey, move.

744
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:53,541
Okay, not here.
You sit in the front.

745
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:57,166
Please sit.

746
00:53:57,791 --> 00:53:59,041
Please make yourself comfortable.

747
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,083
Ramanna, start the car.

748
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:17,166
Sir, looks like I can take
an auto rickshaw from here.

749
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:18,791
Can you please pull over?

750
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,500
Okay, I'll stop at
the signal ahead.

751
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:21,708
Okay, sir.

752
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:10,875
Look at this
It's Bobby's.

753
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:26,541
Hello, boss.

754
00:56:57,458 --> 00:57:01,916
This is the only place where people
don't say "Smile please."

755
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:05,166
Hey, say it. Come on, say it.

756
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,083
Smile please.

757
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:09,083
Yes, say it, smile please.

758
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:10,083
Smile please, madam.

759
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:13,958
Come on, say it. Girl's should
always have a smile on their face.

760
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,083
Smile please.

761
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,041
A single scratch on
this girl and I will kill you.

762
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:36,375
Okay, sir.

763
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:37,958
Be careful.

764
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:46,750
Where's Bobby?

765
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:47,791
Upstairs, sir.

766
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:53,416
Look.

767
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:56,666
I can see your prince charming.

768
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:58,833
Really?

769
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:01,458
Would he sweep me off my feet?

770
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:04,750
Tell me, Bobby!

771
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:11,750
Do you think I'll let him?

772
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:15,333
Damn you! You talk rubbish!

773
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,291
Bobby doll!

774
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:22,541
Bobby doll!

775
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,750
Damn!

776
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:26,833
Devaragunda!

777
00:58:26,916 --> 00:58:28,541
Bobby doll!

778
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:30,166
Bobby!

779
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:33,916
Let me go! Let me go!
Father!

780
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,125
-Let go of me!
-Hey, Bobby doll.

781
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:41,291
Hey, Bobby.

782
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:46,333
I've told you already.
Do not call me by that name.

783
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,333
It sounds dirty.

784
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:52,916
Call me, Bobby.

785
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:55,666
Bobby doll!

786
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,875
Hey, I've brought you a gift.
Go check.

787
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:06,791
One doesn't need to check, if the sun
is shining bright in the morning

788
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:10,708
If you've brought it,
it has to be good.

789
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:13,750
I'm a street magician.

790
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:16,875
If I see a girl on the
street and like her

791
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:20,083
she'll vanish into thin air.

792
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:21,750
That's stealing!

793
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:28,500
I'm the invincible wizard. No man
on earth can find out about my tricks!

794
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,833
My love.

795
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:37,250
I wish you were a fish...

796
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:43,000
I would never let you go
out of my aquarium!

797
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,791
I'm not a small fish.

798
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,708
Even the mighty ocean
is small to fit me in.

799
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:56,291
Come on, time to go.
Come on.

800
00:59:58,625 --> 01:00:00,625
So much has changed in 15 years, love.

801
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:02,541
Both the interiors and the exteriors.

802
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,833
It's all because of you.

803
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:15,166
You haven't lost
your elegance at all.

804
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:16,708
I'll get going now.

805
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,208
There's a raid on the harbor.

806
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,666
Take care of her. Just for a week.

807
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:33,625
It's a package worth three million
that I'm leaving in your hands.

808
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:36,458
If anything happens to her.

809
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:40,916
I'll feed you to the sharks.

810
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:43,250
Bobby doll.

811
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:52,916
Look, Devru.
This is the Bobby doll empire.

812
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:59,208
Here, not even the light can
peep out without my permission.

813
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:01,208
You don't have to worry.

814
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,083
You go.

815
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:45,708
Look, this fish can still move.

816
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:52,083
Hey, give me that umbrella.

817
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,708
Let's play a game.

818
01:01:57,208 --> 01:02:00,916
Come on, fish.
Let's see if you can cross the line.

819
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,875
Hey, this fish is still breathing.

820
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:05,625
In this ocean of life

821
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:08,708
our poor fish has only drowned.

822
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:13,500
Boys, pour some water.
Let the poor thing reach the shore.

823
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,708
Come on, fish.

824
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:18,416
Get up! Cross the line.

825
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,375
Die!

826
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:26,791
Now cross this one.

827
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:30,125
I'll make fish fry out of you tonight!

828
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:32,208
Die, you bastard!

829
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,750
Look, how he moves.

830
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:39,208
Boss, Parvathi.

831
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,583
Devaragunda, stop.

832
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:47,875
Run away, my child.

833
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,625
Parvathi, run.

834
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,416
Hey, Devaragunda.

835
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:04,375
Hey, please leave my Parvathi.

836
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:11,083
-No!
-Leave.

837
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,791
-No!
-Leave.

838
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:18,875
-No!
-Leave.

839
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:20,750
Father!

840
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:26,625
Father!
Please save me.

841
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:29,041
No!

842
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:39,041
Pull him.
Pull him.

843
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:49,583
-Here, let me.
-I got him.

844
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:54,541
My daughter! I beg you.
Let me go.

845
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:57,500
Don't let him go.
Hold him back. Hold him.

846
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,291
Enough, boys.

847
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:08,166
Get up.
Get up.

848
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:16,916
A man's life is so miserable.

849
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,875
I'm tired of losing.

850
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:22,458
One has to struggle
so much, even to lose.

851
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:26,458
I am losing to you over here and
to your daughter over there.

852
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:28,625
How beautiful!

853
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:39,625
You son of a bitch.

854
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:41,833
-Parvathi
-Die, bastard!

855
01:04:55,125 --> 01:05:01,833
Par...
Parvathi!

856
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:04,833
Parvathi? Parvathi?

857
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:07,750
Go, get me a nice fish fry, boys.

858
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:13,000
Paaru.

859
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:14,708
My child.

860
01:05:14,791 --> 01:05:16,041
Father.

861
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,958
-Sushma!
-Father.

862
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,750
Help me.
Let me go, let me go.

863
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:22,458
Sushma.

864
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:26,750
Let me go.
Please let me go.

865
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:30,708
Let me go!
Father!

866
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:32,333
-Boss, what about her?
-She'll be Bobby's doll.

867
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:35,208
Let me go!

868
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,916
See you.

869
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:18,416
Sister! Sister, come here.

870
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,958
Dad, come here!

871
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:29,041
Suzie.

872
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,250
Did somebody say something to you?

873
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:01,083
The world is not just what you see.

874
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:05,916
Come with me and you'll
see how beautiful the world is!

875
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:08,750
Will you take me away from here?

876
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,666
Will you fly with me?

877
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:21,916
Will you always be by my side?

878
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,375
Yes.

879
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:30,416
Bobby, the new girl is just not eating.

880
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,875
Will you come and see her once?

881
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:11,333
Give me the plate.

882
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:20,625
Eat, my child.

883
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:26,875
You should never refuse food.
Come on, be a good girl now.

884
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:36,500
When I have food or work in my hands.

885
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:39,666
I don't get angry.

886
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:43,166
Stop resisting.
Here, eat this.

887
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:48,208
No, I beg you.

888
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,541
Please don't do this to me

889
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:58,500
I don't have anyone to call.

890
01:08:58,583 --> 01:09:04,541
All I have is my boyfriend,
who loves me a lot.

891
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:10,166
For once, allow me to go and see
him. I swear, I'll come back.

892
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,500
Please let me go.

893
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:17,083
I'll meet him and be right back.

894
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,333
I promise.
Please let me go.

895
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:25,041
-Please.
-"No flesh, no bones"

896
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:29,500
"No blood in the heart"

897
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:33,333
-Tiger.
-Madam.

898
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:38,958
Look how well she has
planned to kill me.

899
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:43,750
She is the cow, Punyakoti.

900
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:46,375
I'm the tiger.

901
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,958
I'll let her go.

902
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:53,458
She'll meet her boyfriend and come back.

903
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:55,708
And then...

904
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:58,500
looking at her honesty...

905
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:02,166
I'll jump off a cliff and die of guilt.

906
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:05,000
No, no.

907
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:07,166
Listen, child.

908
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:12,208
You're not supposed to have such bad
thoughts for the one who feeds you.

909
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:16,541
Here, eat now.

910
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:20,125
Eat!

911
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:25,208
No, Bobby wait.

912
01:10:25,291 --> 01:10:28,500
Devaragunda, won't tolerate a
single mark on her body.

913
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:29,958
If he finds out...

914
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:33,375
Why the hell do you guys come,
when you don't have money?

915
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:35,041
This isn't a bank to give you credit.

916
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,333
Who is that?

917
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:37,916
That's Radha.

918
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:41,625
Bring her here.

919
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:42,708
Okay, Bobby.

920
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:44,208
I'll teach her a lesson.

921
01:10:44,291 --> 01:10:47,541
-You better pay or I'll bring Bobby here.
-No, no. Here, keep this ring.

922
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:53,125
For the butter to melt,
it has to be heated.

923
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:55,375
Hey.

924
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,500
Pay attention!

925
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:59,541
Listen to me very carefully.

926
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:05,458
If the cot is shaky, then
you hit a nail to the cot.

927
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:08,791
I'll show you how.

928
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:19,958
Bobby.

929
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:25,291
What the hell was that?

930
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:29,291
Nagu wasn't paying.
I was just--

931
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:35,750
-Bobby...
-Is he your husband?

932
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,083
-Bobby!
-I guess you think, this is your house.

933
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:39,500
Bobby, stop. Let her go.

934
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:41,500
-Radha.
-Hey.

935
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:42,875
What the fuck!

936
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:44,541
Bobby are you possessed?
Please stop.

937
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:47,333
Who the hell are you to stop me?
Who are you?

938
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:48,541
-Tupri.
-Tupri, let's go.

939
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:50,416
I'll take care of this. Go!

940
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:51,541
Daisy!

941
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,750
Bobby, no. Bobby! Bobby!

942
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:57,416
I gave you a little freedom and
this is what I get from you? Bitch!

943
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:01,750
-I'll kill you.
-Bobby, let her go.

944
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,666
Hey, Bobby.

945
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,750
This beauty.
This is what you're after!

946
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:30,625
What if I take it away?

947
01:12:32,916 --> 01:12:34,875
What will you sell?

948
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:38,083
Tell me, Bobby.

949
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:42,708
The child's hurt.
Go help her.

950
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:44,250
Hey, Robin.

951
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:46,541
Go. Take that piece of
glass away from her.

952
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,583
Don't you dare come closer!

953
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:55,625
I'll kill myself.

954
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:57,416
Stay away.

955
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:58,833
Listen, Robin.

956
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:02,875
-Take her to her boyfriend.
-Okay.

957
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:05,416
Look, I've told him to do so.

958
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,250
Be a good girl now.

959
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,541
Give it to me please.

960
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13,791
You look scared, Bobby.

961
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:19,708
Let me tell you this.

962
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:23,583
In this game, I am the winner!

963
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:48,666
Do you want to play with Bobby?

964
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,875
From now on, you'll live in hell.

965
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:55,916
Enough, Bobby!

966
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:58,333
Bobby, what about Devarangunda?

967
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:04,000
Bobby!

968
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:08,458
-Robin, come with me.
-Okay, Bobby.

969
01:14:19,041 --> 01:14:20,541
How about this one?

970
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:32,541
-Come.
-Hello.

971
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:35,416
Hello, sir.

972
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:47,916
What is your name?

973
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:49,875
Sir, my name is Prakash.

974
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,541
What do you do?

975
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:53,541
Software engineer, sir.

976
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:54,625
Photo.

977
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,541
Give me a minute.
I'll quickly upload this.

978
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:08,625
Look, I got eight likes already.

979
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:10,708
-Sir, you're a star.
-Sir, please.

980
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:13,333
This is Asha.

981
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,125
Oh! This one!

982
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:19,916
What did she steal from you?

983
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,250
-Sir, please hear me out.
-Alright, tell me.

984
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:24,041
We were about to get married.

985
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:26,541
Our girl is not a thief, sir.

986
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:28,708
They both love each other.

987
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:31,000
She's in love with a lot of men.

988
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,458
This isn't any different!

989
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:34,666
-Sir, please!
-I know her kind.

990
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,333
She's been missing for three days.

991
01:15:36,416 --> 01:15:38,291
-Please try to understand.
-What?

992
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,083
You say she's been missing for 3 days

993
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:43,416
and you've come to us now?

994
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,625
What were you doing till now?

995
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,250
You need to file a complaint
as soon as possible.

996
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:49,583
And now you're shouting at me?

997
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:52,125
Sir, I'll be traveling
to London for work.

998
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:53,958
I was busy with visa processing.

999
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:57,708
I tried calling her a few times.
Her phone was switched off.

1000
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,875
When I got a call from the orphanage

1001
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,333
I found out that she was missing.

1002
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:02,916
Ma'am, do you suspect someone?

1003
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,958
No, sir.

1004
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:08,708
But I will inform you as soon as
a doubt arises.

1005
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:10,291
-Mr. Prakash.
-Sir.

1006
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:14,708
Until this case is solved,
you're not supposed to leave the town.

1007
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:17,500
You will have to come,
whenever we ask you to.

1008
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:18,583
-Okay?
-Okay, sir.

1009
01:16:18,666 --> 01:16:19,750
Alright, you may leave now.

1010
01:16:19,833 --> 01:16:21,250
-Okay, sir.
-Sir, if you don't mind.

1011
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:23,500
I want to assist you.
Please, sir.

1012
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:25,416
Asha is very important to me.

1013
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,791
Look, mister.

1014
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,750
I don't want you to get
involved in this investigation.

1015
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:32,958
Because it might create more problem,
to solve this case.

1016
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:35,625
You keep calm, we'll find her.

1017
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:37,750
You can leave. You too, ma'am.

1018
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:38,875
Thank you, sir.

1019
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:40,833
Thank you, sir.

1020
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:42,125
Alright.

1021
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:44,208
Hey, write down about his complaint.

1022
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:45,625
Okay, sir.

1023
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,833
Pull over.

1024
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,166
Hello.

1025
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:14,750
Hello, Bobby doll!

1026
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:17,250
Yes, Devru.

1027
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,791
How's my little fish, love?

1028
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:25,708
She's alright.
She's eating well. Don't worry.

1029
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:27,750
Shafiullah had called from Dubai.

1030
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:29,666
That's why I called you.

1031
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:31,125
Oh! Okay.

1032
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:33,791
I hope you're not attempting
to play a game with me.

1033
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:35,333
Not at all. I wouldn't dare.

1034
01:17:35,666 --> 01:17:37,041
So there is no problem, right?

1035
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:39,166
No, not at all.

1036
01:17:39,666 --> 01:17:41,041
She's my responsibility.

1037
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,208
You don't worry.

1038
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,791
I...
I'll take care of her.

1039
01:17:47,791 --> 01:17:50,458
Okay, bye-bye.

1040
01:18:01,125 --> 01:18:03,000
You poor girl.
Why did you do this to yourself?

1041
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:07,250
My whole life is ruined now.

1042
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:09,125
What will I do with such a face?

1043
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:10,666
Asha.

1044
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:16,250
None of it will make any
difference to these people.

1045
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:21,375
There's an alternative to every girl.

1046
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:23,958
If not you, then somebody else!

1047
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:27,083
You're right.

1048
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:29,416
Just because I refused to eat, she...

1049
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:31,916
I'm so sorry.

1050
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,208
She got beaten up because of me.

1051
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:41,875
I didn't do this for myself.

1052
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:45,375
I did it for my guy.

1053
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:50,625
He would still love me and
marry me with a such a face.

1054
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:54,166
Even if he finds out that I
was in a place like this.

1055
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,625
My whole life will fall
short to return his love.

1056
01:18:58,125 --> 01:19:01,750
Do such men really exist?

1057
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,958
If you're love is strong.

1058
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:07,500
It'll definitely take you out of here.

1059
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,750
Nobody will harm you.

1060
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:13,791
But don't attempt to do such things again.

1061
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,041
I've always told Bobby

1062
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:18,916
to avoid forcing
and torturing.

1063
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:23,083
All they need is a girl...

1064
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:25,541
to toy her around with men on bed!

1065
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:29,083
I beg you.

1066
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:31,666
Please help me to get out of this place.

1067
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:36,666
Wait for two days, Asha.
Let's find a solution.

1068
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:47,916
-What's happening, Tupri?
-Rashmi is on the terrace.

1069
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,083
-What are you saying?
-Move, let me go.

1070
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,541
Rashmi might jump off the terrace.
I'm scared.

1071
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:53,458
I'll wake up Daisy.

1072
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:54,708
What?

1073
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:56,875
Daisy!

1074
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:58,875
Daisy!

1075
01:19:59,958 --> 01:20:02,750
Rashmi is up on the terrace.
She's attempting a suicide.

1076
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:05,416
What's wrong with you?
Have you lost your mind?

1077
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:07,958
Why would I joke about such a thing?

1078
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:08,875
Come with me.

1079
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:10,541
Come, Daisy.

1080
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,416
Everyone seems to be tensed.

1081
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:17,958
This is the right for
you to escape from here.

1082
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:20,291
Nobody will find out.

1083
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:21,916
Go to your guy.

1084
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,500
I will take care of the rest.

1085
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:24,458
Go, Asha.

1086
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:25,541
Go.

1087
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:27,166
-Go.
-Listen...

1088
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:31,000
Rashmi, get down.
Come down, please.

1089
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:32,458
No, I won't.

1090
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:33,625
Please listen to us, you'll fall.

1091
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:35,333
Rashmi, you better get down
or I'll have to come up.

1092
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,333
If anyone of you come up,
I'll jump right away.

1093
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:39,416
Hey, stop fooling around.

1094
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,916
No, I am not coming down!

1095
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,500
Enough, Rashmi.
Come down.

1096
01:20:42,791 --> 01:20:44,291
Stop it.

1097
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:48,500
Hey, Rashmi.
Enough of your games.

1098
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,250
-Get down.
-No.

1099
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:52,541
-Please, Rashmi.
-No, I won't.

1100
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:55,083
-Hey, Rashmi.
-Get down.

1101
01:20:57,041 --> 01:20:58,958
Hey, Rashmi. Get down.

1102
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,958
No, I'm not coming down.

1103
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:02,916
Listen to your sister, Daisy.
Please.

1104
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,583
I've asked the dance
master to come over.

1105
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:06,750
You're lying.

1106
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:08,666
No, I will not get down.

1107
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,458
-You also never take me out.
-Come down.

1108
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:14,458
No, sister. I won't get down.
If I get down they'll make me like you.

1109
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:15,958
-Please.
-Hey, what rubbish.

1110
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:19,041
We're all with you, nobody
will harm you.

1111
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:23,375
No, you're all lying.
I'm not getting down.

1112
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:25,875
Don't be silly.
Please come down.

1113
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:29,500
They were about to dress
me up in short clothes.

1114
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:32,541
I heard them talking.
They're sending me away.

1115
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:35,708
You're not going anywhere, baby.

1116
01:21:36,208 --> 01:21:38,083
No. Even you know it.
You're lying.

1117
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:41,208
Bobby wants to send me away.
I'm not coming.

1118
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,833
I don't want to live like you!

1119
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:46,708
-I want to become a dancer.
-Come, my dear.

1120
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:50,125
Rashmi. Rashmi.
No, baby.

1121
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:51,458
-Why did you come?
-Don't do that.

1122
01:21:51,666 --> 01:21:53,541
No, I'm not coming.
Leave me alone.

1123
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:54,958
Otherwise, I'll jump.

1124
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:58,375
Rashmi, listen. Nobody can send
you anywhere.

1125
01:21:58,458 --> 01:21:59,291
-No.
-I...

1126
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:01,250
-I've come here to be with you.
-No, that's a lie.

1127
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,625
Rashmi. Rashmi, listen to me.

1128
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,833
-Why would they send you?
-If you don't go, I'll jump right now.

1129
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:08,958
-Please come. Please.
-I won't.

1130
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:12,041
Why did you show your
dirty side to this poor girl?

1131
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:13,958
Tupri, you go up there.

1132
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:15,416
If I go, she'll jump.

1133
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,791
Aren't you ashamed of it?

1134
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,458
Daisy, stop.

1135
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:22,083
She is a kid, Bobby.

1136
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:25,666
She is my life.

1137
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:29,625
Leave her alone.

1138
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:32,375
Please, Bobby.

1139
01:22:33,166 --> 01:22:34,208
Daisy, listen to me.

1140
01:22:36,041 --> 01:22:39,666
-Tupri, you better go up.
-You're not understanding.

1141
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:42,333
Listen, baby.
Do you want to dance?

1142
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:43,458
I want to dance.

1143
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:45,666
If you slip then you'll fall
and hurt your feet.

1144
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:48,250
You won't be able to dance.
Come with me.

1145
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:51,333
I'm telling you for the last time, Bobby.

1146
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:53,583
Let go of Rashmi.

1147
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:55,875
I won't let anybody take you anywhere.

1148
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:57,375
Promise?

1149
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:58,708
Yes, I promise.

1150
01:22:58,791 --> 01:23:02,583
Asha, bring her down.
Careful.

1151
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:05,541
I run this house.

1152
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:09,791
If you try to cut my roots.

1153
01:23:10,458 --> 01:23:13,750
-Bobby!
-Your heads will roll.

1154
01:23:14,708 --> 01:23:18,291
Easy.
Give me your hand.

1155
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:23,333
Get lost.
Robin!

1156
01:23:25,291 --> 01:23:27,833
-Rashmi!
-Rashmi!

1157
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:30,250
-Rashmi!
-Rashmi!

1158
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:43,041
Rashmi!

1159
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:45,208
Rashmi!

1160
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:48,500
Open your eyes, baby.

1161
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:53,125
Rashmi, look at me.
Please, Rashmi!

1162
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:58,000
Rashmi, look at me.
Open your eyes.

1163
01:24:03,541 --> 01:24:05,916
Rashmi!

1164
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:13,833
-Rashmi.
-Rashmi.

1165
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:16,083
-Rashmi.
-Rashmi.

1166
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:22,208
Tell us, Asha!

1167
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:31,250
I'm sorry.

1168
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:41,666
Rashmi!

1169
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:58,416
Hey, come on.

1170
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:05,500
Hey!
Leave me! Leave me!

1171
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:42,250
Rashmi.

1172
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:19,625
"The tears flow down the face"

1173
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:26,333
"There's silence everywhere"

1174
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:33,208
"This life which
Will come to an end"

1175
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:39,458
"I have become lonely"

1176
01:26:40,416 --> 01:26:46,541
"Why do you play such games?"

1177
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:52,541
"Life is just an illusion"

1178
01:26:53,708 --> 01:27:00,250
"For the heart that broken into pieces"

1179
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:06,958
-"It knows no pain"
-Rashmi!

1180
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:13,333
"The tears flow down the face"

1181
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:20,250
"There's silence everywhere"

1182
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:56,833
"There's never-ending pain
In the waves and in the sea"

1183
01:27:57,083 --> 01:28:03,416
"There's pain in the
Corner of the heart"

1184
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:10,250
"There's unlimited naughtiness
In the spell of love"

1185
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:16,833
"There is so much struggle
In the phase of life"

1186
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:23,958
"We're just excuses
In this everlasting life"

1187
01:28:24,041 --> 01:28:30,250
"There's nobody in the fair of life'

1188
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:37,000
"Withered flower, empty lamp"

1189
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:42,250
"What do we do now,"

1190
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:09,833
Tupri.

1191
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:13,916
I raised you like my own child.

1192
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:20,791
I gave you everything.

1193
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:28,458
What will you do now?

1194
01:29:30,291 --> 01:29:32,375
How will you take care of her?

1195
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:39,125
All you life, you've only been a pimp.

1196
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:43,708
Now...

1197
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:52,750
Are you planning to start...

1198
01:29:55,208 --> 01:30:01,083
your own trade by using her?

1199
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:05,666
Loafer!

1200
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:12,541
Leave me, Robin.
Tupri.

1201
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:20,666
You think you can fool me?

1202
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,791
I'll kill you.

1203
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:33,750
Rashmi.

1204
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:39,291
You shouldn't have eyed Rashmi.

1205
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:41,750
You shouldn't have.

1206
01:30:43,666 --> 01:30:47,458
We all loved her, more than our lives.

1207
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:53,833
What did you just say?

1208
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:55,166
You'll kill me, right?

1209
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:58,125
Go ahead!
Kill me. Kill me.

1210
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:04,708
We all died the moment Rashmi died!

1211
01:31:04,791 --> 01:31:08,041
We all died.

1212
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:16,166
You're living in a graveyard,
among all our graves.

1213
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:19,500
Tupri!

1214
01:31:20,583 --> 01:31:24,333
What do you know about me?

1215
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:28,083
I've been noticing lately.

1216
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:30,250
From the time Rashmi's dead.

1217
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:34,166
Everyone of y'all,
is playing their own game!

1218
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:35,791
Hey!

1219
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:38,375
I want all of you to listen...

1220
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:40,500
carefully.

1221
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:42,750
Two days.

1222
01:31:42,958 --> 01:31:44,875
All of you have two days.

1223
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:50,000
This house will go back to
being the way it was.

1224
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:52,500
Am I clear?

1225
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:56,916
Hey, take them inside.

1226
01:31:58,541 --> 01:31:59,583
Bastards.

1227
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:12,625
How long will you stay quiet?

1228
01:32:15,916 --> 01:32:17,333
Look at Tupri.

1229
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:22,291
Bobby knows how to beat up one
and control the rest.

1230
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:27,208
How long will you continue doing this?

1231
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:32,583
This isn't a government job, where you
receive pension and stay comfortably.

1232
01:32:34,916 --> 01:32:37,083
You all will die on the streets.

1233
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:39,166
We want to get out of here too.

1234
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,333
-But--
-Do you want to?

1235
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:43,833
Do you wish to?

1236
01:32:44,916 --> 01:32:46,333
There what are you doing here?

1237
01:32:46,416 --> 01:32:47,583
What are you waiting for?

1238
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,500
The good times will roll in when

1239
01:32:50,583 --> 01:32:52,666
your prince charming
will come and take you out of here.

1240
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,500
Is that what you think?

1241
01:32:55,375 --> 01:32:57,125
No one will come.

1242
01:32:58,625 --> 01:32:59,625
Nobody.

1243
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,375
Instead of taking you
out of the room.

1244
01:33:02,458 --> 01:33:03,875
He'll take you in.

1245
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:10,500
The stray dogs that bite kids,
are shown mercy.

1246
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:12,750
People say it's not the dog's fault.

1247
01:33:13,791 --> 01:33:14,833
But...

1248
01:33:15,041 --> 01:33:17,208
you're worse than those dogs.

1249
01:33:22,041 --> 01:33:24,333
How many of
you are infected with STDs?

1250
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:27,166
How's your health?
Does any one of you know?

1251
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:29,000
Okay.

1252
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:30,958
If you ever give birth...

1253
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:34,458
do you want to share your
disease with the child?

1254
01:33:37,333 --> 01:33:42,083
The tree drops the fruit,
the moment it begins to rot.

1255
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:45,875
And the people?

1256
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,625
Nobody cares about you or your child.

1257
01:33:52,791 --> 01:33:55,916
They'll curse you, they'll pray
for you and your kid to die.

1258
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:58,583
The world is evolving...

1259
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:01,208
the technology is improving.

1260
01:34:02,208 --> 01:34:05,666
Day by day, people are
getting more educated.

1261
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:08,000
But what's the use?

1262
01:34:08,458 --> 01:34:11,666
We still use the terms, "mother"
and "sister" while cussing.

1263
01:34:13,083 --> 01:34:16,791
For those who don't even realize
the value of their mother and sister...

1264
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,166
do you think they'll
listen to your miseries?

1265
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:26,041
There's no point to continue like this.

1266
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:28,291
It's time to wake up.

1267
01:34:29,666 --> 01:34:31,750
People think of ghosts in the night.

1268
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:34,375
And then, there's you.

1269
01:34:35,458 --> 01:34:37,958
How long will live like corpses?

1270
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:41,250
Come out with me.
Just once.

1271
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:50,958
Bobby was right.

1272
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:53,958
We were the ones who killed Rashmi.

1273
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:58,125
Our fears, our helplessness,
our life threats.

1274
01:35:00,291 --> 01:35:03,708
If we had a little courage,
Rashmi would have been alive.

1275
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:07,291
We were too scared and
it cost us a life.

1276
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:12,375
If we continue being afraid,
more will die.

1277
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,750
If we continue...

1278
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:17,000
more Bobbys will laugh at us.

1279
01:35:17,333 --> 01:35:19,166
We'll still continue
to sit and do nothing.

1280
01:35:21,166 --> 01:35:23,833
One fine day, we'll all die.

1281
01:35:25,166 --> 01:35:28,208
We'll have no one to cry for us.

1282
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,541
We either walk out or
die right here fighting them.

1283
01:35:34,958 --> 01:35:36,916
If you step out with me,
I'll promise you a better life.

1284
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,166
Trust me.

1285
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:42,875
But if we die fighting here...

1286
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:46,875
We should be happy,
as our deaths won't be in vain.

1287
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:52,000
This is our last night here.

1288
01:35:53,208 --> 01:35:54,083
Think.

1289
01:35:57,958 --> 01:35:59,083
Asha.

1290
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:16,833
I'm just a sailor, fighting the
tides to take you to the shores of love.

1291
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:19,083
Will you always be by my side?

1292
01:36:23,625 --> 01:36:26,458
Let me go.
Let me go.

1293
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:29,916
How long will you live like corpses?

1294
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,500
We'll die right here, fighting them.

1295
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:34,958
I run this house!

1296
01:36:41,833 --> 01:36:43,583
How long will you live like corpses?

1297
01:36:43,833 --> 01:36:45,625
We'll die right here fighting them.

1298
01:36:45,708 --> 01:36:47,125
This is our last night here.

1299
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,875
Think.

1300
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:28,416
Hide it.

1301
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:37,083
-Hey, Suzie!
-Are you trying to kill me?

1302
01:37:37,166 --> 01:37:40,583
-I won't spare you.
-Let her go. Let her go.

1303
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Hold him back.

1304
01:37:43,083 --> 01:37:45,291
-Suzie!
-Leave her.

1305
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:50,083
-Let go of her.
-Let go of her.

1306
01:37:53,791 --> 01:37:54,958
Let go of her.

1307
01:38:31,958 --> 01:38:33,416
Where are you going?

1308
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,583
How dare you plot against Bobby?

1309
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:46,541
Who the fuck are you?

1310
01:38:48,375 --> 01:38:50,250
Who are you?

1311
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:17,208
You!

1312
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:30,458
Leave us.

1313
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:49,791
You!

1314
01:39:52,791 --> 01:39:55,583
Radha, kill him.

1315
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:06,750
Come on.

1316
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:43,541
Daisy, gun!

1317
01:40:45,791 --> 01:40:47,833
-No, don't shoot.
-Shoot!

1318
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:50,083
-Don't shoot me, please.
-Shoot.

1319
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:55,916
-No!
-Now shoot.

1320
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,625
Where is Daisy?
Daisy.

1321
01:41:24,666 --> 01:41:25,875
Come, Suzie.

1322
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:41,625
Suzie?

1323
01:41:41,708 --> 01:41:43,791
Daisy, stop.
Daisy, stop.

1324
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:46,916
Stop it.
He's dead.

1325
01:42:04,166 --> 01:42:06,500
"She is loved,
She is giver of wealth"

1326
01:42:06,958 --> 01:42:09,041
"She is strong,
She supports the earth"

1327
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:12,250
"She is the brightest illumination"

1328
01:42:12,666 --> 01:42:14,750
"She is the supreme Goddess of the gurus"

1329
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:21,250
"She is the ultimate guru, the ultimate
Truth and the manifestation of the soul"

1330
01:42:42,833 --> 01:42:45,541
You know what hurts me?

1331
01:42:45,958 --> 01:42:48,375
It's not the bullet.

1332
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:55,166
But the fact that you're
pointing the pistol at me.

1333
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:58,083
That hurts me the most.

1334
01:42:59,708 --> 01:43:03,083
I might have crushed your dreams.

1335
01:43:05,583 --> 01:43:09,000
But I've given you all the love.

1336
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,041
I might have taken away your youth...

1337
01:43:18,333 --> 01:43:23,250
but I've taught you about life.

1338
01:43:25,333 --> 01:43:29,416
Who's going to take care of you
after I'm dead, my love?

1339
01:43:29,666 --> 01:43:31,750
Daisy, don't fall for her words.

1340
01:43:32,291 --> 01:43:33,166
Don't trust her.

1341
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:34,541
Shoot her.

1342
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:35,833
Hey!

1343
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:41,291
This is my family.

1344
01:43:44,958 --> 01:43:46,916
Daisy, I'm your mother--

1345
01:43:54,958 --> 01:43:57,083
"She is loved,
She is giver of wealth"

1346
01:43:57,791 --> 01:43:59,583
"She is strong,
She supports the earth"

1347
01:44:00,541 --> 01:44:02,500
"She is the brightest illumination"

1348
01:44:03,416 --> 01:44:05,041
"She is the supreme Goddess of the gurus"

1349
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:12,000
"She is the ultimate guru, the ultimate
Truth and the manifestation of the soul"

1350
01:44:38,458 --> 01:44:40,916
Our work is undone.

1351
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,583
There is more to it.

1352
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,625
Will you help me please?

1353
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,375
Don't ask for help.
Demand for it.

1354
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:50,750
I owe my life to you.

1355
01:44:52,416 --> 01:44:54,208
I've written everything in this.

1356
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:56,166
I've also written the address
it needs to be delivered to.

1357
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:59,375
-Shall we go?
-Okay.

1358
01:45:34,333 --> 01:45:36,125
Let's stay here
for tonight.

1359
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:37,833
We have a lot of work tomorrow.

1360
01:45:37,916 --> 01:45:38,750
Okay.

1361
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:40,083
-Come.
-Come, Tupri.

1362
01:45:40,166 --> 01:45:41,416
Daisy, hand me that bag.

1363
01:46:07,541 --> 01:46:09,250
What is it with them?

1364
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:11,791
They're saying they've
fled their village

1365
01:46:11,875 --> 01:46:13,458
and come to us in a search of a job!

1366
01:46:15,708 --> 01:46:19,041
I think I've seen
them somewhere.

1367
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:22,583
I mean, I have a lot
of female friends, right?

1368
01:46:22,666 --> 01:46:24,041
I felt like I've seen them somewhere.

1369
01:46:24,375 --> 01:46:25,291
What happened to you?

1370
01:46:25,666 --> 01:46:27,125
Why are you making them wait in the sun?

1371
01:46:27,208 --> 01:46:29,875
Tell them, the boss
wants to talk to them.

1372
01:46:29,958 --> 01:46:31,208
Okay, boss.

1373
01:46:31,583 --> 01:46:33,083
Hey, come here.

1374
01:46:33,166 --> 01:46:34,000
Come. They're calling us.

1375
01:46:34,083 --> 01:46:36,666
The sun has
seared the poor flowers.

1376
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:39,750
I need to give them some shade.

1377
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:53,875
How are you related to these girls?

1378
01:46:55,083 --> 01:46:56,000
Hello, sir.

1379
01:46:56,583 --> 01:46:59,458
My name is Parmesh, sir.

1380
01:47:00,833 --> 01:47:05,833
These two are my cousins.
They are like my sisters.

1381
01:47:07,583 --> 01:47:10,750
We had borrowed a lot of
money and couldn't pay it back.

1382
01:47:10,833 --> 01:47:13,000
So we fled the village
and came here.

1383
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:17,125
But it's getting very difficult
for us to survive here.

1384
01:47:18,375 --> 01:47:21,291
Are these girls married?

1385
01:47:21,375 --> 01:47:23,333
No, no, sir.
Nothing of that sort.

1386
01:47:23,416 --> 01:47:24,833
Once we settle down here...

1387
01:47:24,916 --> 01:47:26,583
we can think of something.

1388
01:47:28,625 --> 01:47:30,208
In this land of salt...

1389
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:33,208
I feel like, I've been
showered with honey.

1390
01:47:35,166 --> 01:47:36,083
Now, you'll do as I say.

1391
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:37,500
I have a farm house.

1392
01:47:38,208 --> 01:47:39,750
Take the girls there.

1393
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,625
You take care of the farm
and let them look after the house.

1394
01:47:42,708 --> 01:47:45,333
And once in a while, I'll come
for some tender coconut water.

1395
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:46,416
And you shouldn't object.

1396
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:47,833
No, sir.

1397
01:47:47,916 --> 01:47:49,958
Your wish is my command.

1398
01:47:50,125 --> 01:47:51,625
-Impressive boy!
-Very good.

1399
01:47:53,083 --> 01:47:54,416
The sun is about to set...

1400
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,625
and you've already shown me the moon.

1401
01:47:57,166 --> 01:47:59,166
The stream was
running in all directions.

1402
01:47:59,375 --> 01:48:01,583
But you've brought two amazing shores.

1403
01:48:02,916 --> 01:48:04,958
Now you take them to the farmhouse.

1404
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:07,583
I shall join you later.

1405
01:48:08,666 --> 01:48:10,666
You drop them off and
take good care of them.

1406
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:12,083
If somebody asks you about them

1407
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:13,625
tell them that they are your cousins.

1408
01:48:13,708 --> 01:48:15,666
-Okay.
-Now go.

1409
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:16,708
Thank you, sir.

1410
01:48:16,791 --> 01:48:18,041
Here, let me help you.

1411
01:48:19,666 --> 01:48:20,666
Careful.

1412
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,041
Look at her shyness.

1413
01:48:23,125 --> 01:48:24,875
-Okay.
-Thank you very much, sir.

1414
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:27,666
-That's alright.
-Sir, it's generous of you!

1415
01:49:11,916 --> 01:49:14,708
It's a lucky night.
Double delight.

1416
01:49:20,208 --> 01:49:23,833
"They are of different kinds"

1417
01:49:24,458 --> 01:49:30,916
Double variety fishes.
Excellent.

1418
01:49:33,458 --> 01:49:35,125
Hey, don't be shy.

1419
01:49:35,208 --> 01:49:39,291
Hey, I won't bite.

1420
01:49:40,541 --> 01:49:42,875
Okay, here's another one.

1421
01:49:43,375 --> 01:49:47,416
Now this one is terrific.

1422
01:49:49,958 --> 01:49:52,750
I'll show you the heavens!

1423
01:49:52,916 --> 01:49:54,250
Turn around.

1424
01:49:54,416 --> 01:49:56,458
Let me see your face.

1425
01:49:56,583 --> 01:49:57,708
Turn around.

1426
01:50:00,583 --> 01:50:01,750
Hey!

1427
01:50:13,458 --> 01:50:15,166
Why did you stop it, dad?

1428
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:17,791
Oh, because I'm your daughter?

1429
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:19,708
Wait. Let me turn off the lights.

1430
01:50:20,166 --> 01:50:22,708
It doesn't matter who
it is in the dark, right?

1431
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,291
It's only in the light
that you identify

1432
01:50:25,416 --> 01:50:28,958
women as your mother,
daughter or sister.

1433
01:50:29,375 --> 01:50:32,333
I... I...
I'm sorry, child.

1434
01:50:32,666 --> 01:50:35,541
Dad, what happened now?

1435
01:50:35,625 --> 01:50:38,083
You're my life.
You're my everything.

1436
01:50:38,458 --> 01:50:41,541
Why are you so embarrassed?

1437
01:50:41,916 --> 01:50:43,916
You just rubbed my feet.

1438
01:50:44,208 --> 01:50:48,791
The feet of the daughter who took
her first step with your guidance.

1439
01:50:49,708 --> 01:50:50,541
Look.

1440
01:50:50,791 --> 01:50:51,625
Stop it.

1441
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:53,458
These feet are yours.

1442
01:50:54,375 --> 01:50:57,541
This waist you just squeezed...

1443
01:50:58,333 --> 01:51:05,333
is the one, on which you tied a band to
protect me from evil sight.

1444
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:08,500
You held the same waist

1445
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,375
by which you held me up

1446
01:51:10,458 --> 01:51:12,583
and took me around the entire village.

1447
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:16,000
Do you remember, dad?

1448
01:51:23,416 --> 01:51:26,833
You whispered vulgar
words in my ears...

1449
01:51:28,583 --> 01:51:34,375
in which you had to say my name thrice,
when I was born.

1450
01:51:34,833 --> 01:51:36,708
Did you forget, dad?

1451
01:51:40,208 --> 01:51:41,875
Did you forget it?

1452
01:51:45,916 --> 01:51:46,958
It's alright, dad.

1453
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:49,833
I won't feel bad about this.

1454
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:56,750
It's not your fault.

1455
01:51:56,958 --> 01:51:58,875
You're a man.

1456
01:51:59,875 --> 01:52:04,583
Imagine that I'm not your daughter.

1457
01:52:05,208 --> 01:52:08,833
That is what you've been
doing with others' daughters, right?

1458
01:52:08,916 --> 01:52:12,791
This must be a habit, I'm sure.

1459
01:52:13,833 --> 01:52:17,208
-No, child. No. Please stop it.
-Don't come closer.

1460
01:52:20,833 --> 01:52:22,541
I'm scared of you.

1461
01:52:24,458 --> 01:52:27,250
I've hugged you so many times.

1462
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:28,666
Oh Lord.

1463
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:32,166
What thoughts must've
crossed your mind then?

1464
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:35,416
-No!
-I'm even scared to think of it.

1465
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:38,125
It's disgusting.

1466
01:52:43,416 --> 01:52:46,833
You've slept with so many other girls.

1467
01:52:47,458 --> 01:52:50,333
They also must've had fathers, right?

1468
01:52:53,791 --> 01:52:56,916
But no one should have a father like you.

1469
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,666
No one!

1470
01:53:23,708 --> 01:53:27,291
What are you waiting for, Suzie?

1471
01:53:52,250 --> 01:53:56,708
Let Shweta do the job.
It's her right.

1472
01:54:12,625 --> 01:54:14,416
End this, my child.

1473
01:54:15,083 --> 01:54:16,416
Kill me.

1474
01:54:19,458 --> 01:54:20,916
Please forgive me, my child.

1475
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,250
Please.

1476
01:54:24,041 --> 01:54:26,041
Don't touch me.

1477
01:54:35,958 --> 01:54:37,500
Finish it.

1478
01:54:38,083 --> 01:54:41,000
I have sinned.
End my life right now.

1479
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,750
I am disgusted to even kill you!

1480
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:06,541
Asha.

1481
01:56:28,333 --> 01:56:29,541
What is this?

1482
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,166
That...

1483
01:56:34,625 --> 01:56:37,208
Asha, please.

1484
01:56:38,083 --> 01:56:39,625
Asha, please.

1485
01:56:39,875 --> 01:56:42,750
I know, I've made a huge mistake.

1486
01:56:43,375 --> 01:56:45,583
But I really love you a lot, Asha.

1487
01:56:45,666 --> 01:56:47,958
I really love you.

1488
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:53,958
Only after losing you is when
I realized how much I love you.

1489
01:57:06,958 --> 01:57:09,083
"She is loved,
She is giver of wealth"

1490
01:57:09,833 --> 01:57:11,625
"She is strong,
She supports the earth"

1491
01:57:12,583 --> 01:57:14,708
"She is the brightest illumination"

1492
01:57:15,416 --> 01:57:17,333
"She is the supreme Goddess of the gurus"

1493
01:57:18,291 --> 01:57:23,500
"She is the ultimate guru, the ultimate
Truth and the manifestation of the soul"

1494
01:57:29,708 --> 01:57:31,791
"She is loved,
She is giver of wealth"

1495
01:57:34,375 --> 01:57:35,750
I love you, Asha.

1496
01:57:35,833 --> 01:57:37,500
"She is the brightest illumination"

1497
01:57:38,208 --> 01:57:39,833
"She is the supreme Goddess of the gurus"

1498
01:57:40,875 --> 01:57:46,208
"She is the ultimate guru, the ultimate
Truth and the manifestation of the soul"

1499
01:58:11,625 --> 01:58:13,541
Phone!

1500
01:58:14,333 --> 01:58:16,541
I'll be back in two minutes!

1501
01:58:17,291 --> 01:58:19,166
- Is the girl ready?
-Devru.

1502
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:22,291
It's done. You'll find her
the in library in two days!

1503
01:58:22,375 --> 01:58:23,416
No sign or doubt?

1504
01:58:23,708 --> 01:58:24,791
No way.

1505
01:58:25,041 --> 01:58:26,041
Anything else?

1506
01:58:26,125 --> 01:58:27,041
There is no problem.

1507
01:58:27,291 --> 01:58:28,125
Okay, bye.

1508
01:58:43,625 --> 01:58:46,708
Prakash's contact in Bobby's phone?
