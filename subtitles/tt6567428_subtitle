1
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,000
Lord Muniswaran,
please give me an answer.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
I don't understand anything.
–Odd number, I'll pass.

3
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,000
Even number, I'll fail.

4
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,480
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...

5
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,000
...7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,440
...7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,000
Eleven, I will pass.
–Who said so?

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Eleven, I will pass.
–Who said so?

9
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,480
God.
–God?

10
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,600
Kolanji!

11
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,000
Why are you angry?
Any problem?

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why are you angry?
Any problem?

13
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,480
I did not come alone
with these milk cans.

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,000
Why are you playing here?
–This isn't a game.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,920
Why are you playing here?
–This isn't a game.

16
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,000
I am asking God
if I would pass my exam.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,360
I am asking God
if I would pass my exam.

18
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,720
When did God ever speak?
–He just spoke.

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
Sit down,
He will talk to you too.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,200
Sit down,
He will talk to you too.

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,800
Close your eyes
and pray to your deity,..

22
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,000
...then draw the lines.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,160
...then draw the lines.

24
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,880
Draw the lines for him.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You are spoilt rotten
because of your father's ideology.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
You are spoilt rotten
because of your father's ideology.

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,200
I'll make you believe
that there is God.

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,840
You must count the number
of lines he drew.

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,000
Odd number, you'll pass.
Even number, you'll fail, okay?

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,120
Odd number, you'll pass.
Even number, you'll fail, okay?

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,000
I know I will pass.
I don't need your God to tell me.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,280
I know I will pass.
I don't need your God to tell me.

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,000
Then ask what you want to know.
If God's prediction comes true,...

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,800
Then ask what you want to know.
If God's prediction comes true,...

35
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,000
...you must give 5 candies
and 5 chocolates to God.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
...you must give 5 candies
and 5 chocolates to God.

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,480
Am I right?

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,000
What are you thinking?

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,800
What are you thinking?

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,920
Ask your God if my father
will beat me today or not?

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,000
Fantastic, friend. Odd number,
your father won't hit you.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,880
Fantastic, friend. Odd number,
your father won't hit you.

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,600
Even number,
you will surely get smacked.

44
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,680
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...

46
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
...7, 8, 9, 10, 11,...

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,240
...7, 8, 9, 10, 11,...

48
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,720
...12, 13 14, 15,...

49
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,000
...16, 17! Seventeen!
You got an odd number.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
...16, 17! Seventeen!
You got an odd number.

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,000
God just told you that your father
will not hit you.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
God just told you that your father
will not hit you.

53
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,640
Really?
–I promise.

54
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,000
He is here, run!

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,840
He is here, run!

56
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Fool! I told you to deliver milk.
But you're yapping away here.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're spoilt rotten,
do you want to spoil them too?

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,080
You're spoilt rotten,
do you want to spoil them too?

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,000
Come back as fast as you can.
If you go out and have fun...

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,440
Come back as fast as you can.
If you go out and have fun...

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,000
...just to spite me,
I'll smack you. Go on!

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,880
...just to spite me,
I'll smack you. Go on!

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,000
Your father worked against
God's telling.

64
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,400
He will surely hit you.
I'm sorry, my friend.

65
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,960
Is the vehicle running on water?
You don't seem to turn it off.

66
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
Turn it off, it's deafening.
–Is your father paying for it?

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,960
Turn it off, it's deafening.
–Is your father paying for it?

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,960
Why are you dragging
my parents into this?

69
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
You're just like your father.

70
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,080
Pushpam, why are you
yelling at him?

71
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,000
Just do your work.
–You hate it when I scold him.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,120
Just do your work.
–You hate it when I scold him.

73
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,400
Right.

74
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,000
There comes the troublemakers.
Hi.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,280
There comes the troublemakers.
Hi.

76
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,960
Hi
–How are you?

77
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,280
I am good.
–Why say it hesitantly?

78
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
Mom was complaining of leg pain.
How is she now?

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,120
Mom was complaining of leg pain.
How is she now?

80
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,600
She is much better.
–Why must you use your thumb...

81
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,520
...as a pacifier all the time?
If you do that again,...

82
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,000
...I'll burn you
with a hot spoon.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
...I'll burn you
with a hot spoon.

84
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,800
I bet. Don't com
to our house again.

85
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,000
Who are you to tell me that
I can't come to my aunt's house?

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,280
Who are you to tell me that
I can't come to my aunt's house?

87
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,480
Chitra, why are you fighting
with him at this hour?

88
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
As if I came all made up
just to fight with your son.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
As if I came all made up
just to fight with your son.

90
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Your sister–in–law sent
some of this. Enjoy it.

91
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Why are you leaving so soon?
–It's getting late.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,240
Why are you leaving so soon?
–It's getting late.

93
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,280
I must fertilise the land and catch
enough water before...

94
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
...the supply is switched off.
–Isn't Gemini around?

95
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,800
Come on,
farming will die with us.

96
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,960
Kids nowadays do not
like to work hard.

97
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,000
He did not even do well in school.
What will I do with him? Bye.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He did not even do well in school.
What will I do with him? Bye.

99
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,320
Bye.
–Bye, brother!

100
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,000
You'll come first thing
in the morning.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,440
You'll come first thing
in the morning.

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,480
Who is bothered
if you do not come here?

103
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,200
Hey!

104
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes?
–Won't you ask from there?

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,960
Yes?
–Won't you ask from there?

106
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,200
Yes, what do you want me to do?

107
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,000
Arrogance?
Go and get the container.

108
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,000
My mom says You are real,
my dad says You are not real.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,760
My mom says You are real,
my dad says You are not real.

110
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,920
I do not know if You are real.
If You are real,...

111
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,000
...You won't watching me being
tortured by my father.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
...You won't watching me being
tortured by my father.

113
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,560
But if You are real and
watching all that is happening,...

114
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,000
...You need not be around.
If You are really around,...

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,360
...You need not be around.
If You are really around,...

116
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,840
...take me away from my father
and give me freedom.

117
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,000
If You do that,
You need not be here.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,080
If You do that,
You need not be here.

119
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,600
I'll put You on the stand
and make you look pretty.

120
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,680
Do You understand?

121
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,080
Appa (dad), here you go.
–Fool!

122
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,520
I told you not to call me Appa.
Why do you keep calling me Appa?

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,480
Do you know
why he is calling me appa (dad)?

124
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,280
Why?
–Perumal, where did you steal...

125
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,000
...this idol of Vinayagar?
–Your father is the only man...

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,920
How can you be so disrespectful?
Isn't this wrong?

127
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,000
Hey, I even call my father Appa
because his name is Appasamy.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,760
Hey, I even call my father Appa
because his name is Appasamy.

129
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,680
Why should I respect you?
–Now do you know why...

130
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
...he calls me appa (dad)?
And do you know what he does?

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,440
...he calls me appa (dad)?
And do you know what he does?

132
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,760
Where are you going?

133
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,000
Saw (talk too much)

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,160
Saw (talk too much)

135
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,920
What is this?
Will you do this again?

136
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,000
Get lost, you saw!

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,600
Get lost, you saw!

138
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,000
Miss, the science teacher told me
to pass this love letter to you.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,920
Miss, the science teacher told me
to pass this love letter to you.

140
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,840
Sir!

141
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll tell the HM
to issue a TC for your son.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,920
I'll tell the HM
to issue a TC for your son.

143
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,800
Would I write a love letter
at this age?

144
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,000
My ear is still ringing.
–Your son is too much.

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,360
My ear is still ringing.
–Your son is too much.

146
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,840
He threw a bomb in class.
What would have happened...

147
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,000
...if it had fallen on my head?
–He stole mangos from my orchard.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
...if it had fallen on my head?
–He stole mangos from my orchard.

149
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,360
He will come to no good.
–Stop, don't spoil the tractor.

150
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,000
Appasamy, your son drove
my tractor and trashed it.

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,760
Appasamy, your son drove
my tractor and trashed it.

152
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,000
Neelavenny!

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,120
Neelavenny!

154
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,360
Did you get scared?

155
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,320
Please talk some sense to him.
–Do you know what he does now?

156
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,000
If you go out once I leave,
I'll smack you.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,240
If you go out once I leave,
I'll smack you.

158
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,880
Kolanji!

159
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,040
Where are you going?
–I'm going to meet Uncle Gemini.

160
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,000
Gemini!

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,480
Gemini!

162
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,000
Gemini!

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,040
Gemini!

164
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
Your father may come here
with his Bullet.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Your father may come here
with his Bullet.

166
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,160
He'll yell at you in front of me.
I'll be embarrassed.

167
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,000
He yells in front of you?
He scolds be because of you.

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,280
He yells in front of you?
He scolds be because of you.

169
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,560
It's natural
for my father to scold me.

170
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,000
It happens daily.
But when I am with you,...

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,800
It happens daily.
But when I am with you,...

172
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,000
...he scolds you too,
that's hard for me to accept.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,640
...he scolds you too,
that's hard for me to accept.

174
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,520
If you do as he says,
he won't hit you.

175
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,000
If I live as he dictates,
when can I live the way I want?

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
If I live as he dictates,
when can I live the way I want?

177
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,760
He's right. We must learn
things at the right age.

178
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,800
Then we'll be useful
when we grow up.

179
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,000
Now that you have moustache,
you're advising me as I'm younger.

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,800
Now that you have moustache,
you're advising me as I'm younger.

181
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,000
It's because I care about you.
–That's not necessary.

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,760
It's because I care about you.
–That's not necessary.

183
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,560
Just mind your business,
things will go on as it should.

184
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,960
No point blaming you,
I should blame myself.

185
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,920
I roam with you despite
our age difference.

186
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,960
As if you're a scientist
at the rocket company.

187
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,560
His reputation will be gone
if he is seen with me.

188
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,720
Come on, uncle.
You're going out with me...

189
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,000
...as you need an outlet
to reach out for your cousin.

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,960
...as you need an outlet
to reach out for your cousin.

191
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,000
You get upset over small things.
Don't you think this is childish?

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,400
You get upset over small things.
Don't you think this is childish?

193
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,000
Fine, I think my sister is coming.
Don't pull a face now,...

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,920
Fine, I think my sister is coming.
Don't pull a face now,...

195
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,000
...be cheerful.
–I felt it too.

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,120
...be cheerful.
–I felt it too.

197
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,760
Whenever your sister appears,
I hear a bell.

198
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,000
How do you know she is coming?
–I heard the same bell.

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,360
How do you know she is coming?
–I heard the same bell.

200
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,000
If you hear the same bell
that I hear, what does it mean?

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,600
If you hear the same bell
that I hear, what does it mean?

202
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,480
It means my sister keeps pressing
the bell on her bicycle.

203
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
It's not love bells,
but my sister's bicycle bell.

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,400
It's not love bells,
but my sister's bicycle bell.

205
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,640
Look over there.

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Rose...

207
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Rose...

208
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Hey, rose...

209
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,240
Rose...

210
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,360
Hey, rose...

211
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
I will love youand hold your hands...

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,560
I will love youand hold your hands...

213
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,000
With love...

214
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,960
Hey, rose...

215
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,000
I only want your love...

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,560
I only want your love...

217
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,000
In a gentle way...

218
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,800
Hey, rose...

219
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,000
Because of you,I became a naughty hero...

220
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,200
Because of you,I became a naughty hero...

221
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,000
Hey, rose...

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,760
Hey, rose...

223
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,120
Because of you,I got drunk and got wasted...

224
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,320
But you spat on meand left me...

225
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,880
Rose...

226
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,000
Go, are you Kamal Haasanfor me to fall for you...

227
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,640
Go, are you Kamal Haasanfor me to fall for you...

228
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,000
Come like a hero...

229
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,880
Come like a hero...

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,280
Go, you small fry...

231
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,000
Don't dream...

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,120
Don't dream...

233
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,320
What do you want...

234
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,000
There is no truthin these sweet words...

235
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,000
You're an anti–flee shampoo...

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You're an anti–flee shampoo...

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I want you to have my kids,we can live happily...

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,360
I want you to have my kids,we can live happily...

239
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,880
Girl, give me a good answer...

240
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,920
You stand afar like a villain...

241
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,000
I grow beard as I miss you...

242
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,000
Give me your heart...

243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
Give me your heart...

244
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll dieso that you can live...

245
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,080
I'll dieso that you can live...

246
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,960
...like Jack of Titanic...

247
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,000
Come on...

248
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,400
Come on...

249
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,840
Perumal, why are you
standing out here?

250
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,000
Nothing, we want our kids to study
in this English school too.

251
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,120
Nothing, we want our kids to study
in this English school too.

252
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,120
I think the trustee
doesn't like it.

253
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,000
He is talking to the principal.
–Why isn't Vellappan in favour...

254
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,080
He is talking to the principal.
–Why isn't Vellappan in favour...

255
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,360
...of your kids studying here?
–What are you saying?

256
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,000
Can they sit
with our kids and study?

257
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,120
Can they sit
with our kids and study?

258
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,280
If they ask out of ignorance,
must you allow it?

259
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,000
If those who do not brush
their teeth go to school,...

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,120
If those who do not brush
their teeth go to school,...

261
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,320
...who will work?
–Parents are ready to pay the fees.

262
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,000
It isn't fair to tell them
that there is no seat.

263
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,200
It isn't fair to tell them
that there is no seat.

264
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,840
Sir, this is our decision.
We will not allow those kids...

265
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,240
...from that street to study
with our kids.

266
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,000
What do you say?
–Yes.

267
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,520
What do you say?
–Yes.

268
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,920
I don't think it is right for
those kids to study with our kids.

269
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,000
We've been practising it
for generations.

270
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,840
We've been practising it
for generations.

271
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,440
Why change it now?
–Since whose time?

272
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,000
Our elders of course.
–Which elders?

273
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,360
Our elders of course.
–Which elders?

274
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,720
They are outsiders.
I mean our people.

275
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,680
Our people are outsiders too.

276
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,000
You gave priority to the outsiders,
you kept your affairs outside.

277
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,040
You gave priority to the outsiders,
you kept your affairs outside.

278
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
Now, someone else's culture
have become our way,...

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,240
Now, someone else's culture
have become our way,...

280
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,320
...you have cast aside
those who were living with us.

281
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,000
Only when you leave Tamil Nadu,
you call yourselves Tamilan.

282
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,080
Only when you leave Tamil Nadu,
you call yourselves Tamilan.

283
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,000
But in Tamil Nadu,
you are divided by caste.

284
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,440
But in Tamil Nadu,
you are divided by caste.

285
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,760
You prohibit the men who live
with you to enter your house,...

286
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,000
...can you enter the house of
the man who made this a practice?

287
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,880
...can you enter the house of
the man who made this a practice?

288
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,960
You can't, because to him,
you're untouchable.

289
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,000
This is also the same practice.
Gurukal!

290
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,720
This is also the same practice.
Gurukal!

291
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,440
Yes?
–Will you allow our trustee...

292
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,000
...to enter the temple sanctum?
–How can I allow that?

293
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,920
...to enter the temple sanctum?
–How can I allow that?

294
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,360
Did you hear that?

295
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,000
The priest who won't allow you
into his area has told you...

296
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,640
The priest who won't allow you
into his area has told you...

297
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,840
...to keep your friends away
and you have done just that.

298
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,000
Times are changing.

299
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,760
Times are changing.

300
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,920
Only in Tamil Nadu, Indians do not
put their caste behind their names.

301
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,000
Do you know why? It is the land
where Periyar was born.

302
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,040
Do you know why? It is the land
where Periyar was born.

303
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,000
Do you ask the person sitting
next to you in a bus or train...

304
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,360
Do you ask the person sitting
next to you in a bus or train...

305
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,640
...their caste?
In theatres, restaurants,...

306
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,360
...ration shops,
queues for freebies,...

307
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,000
...you do not look at caste,
all of you stand together.

308
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,680
...you do not look at caste,
all of you stand together.

309
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,360
But in schools where we teach
our kids there is no caste,...

310
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,000
...why is there segregation
based on caste?

311
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,440
...why is there segregation
based on caste?

312
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,760
Go and do your work.

313
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,000
Vellappa, your dhoti is soiled.
Either you wash or discard it.

314
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Vellappa, your dhoti is soiled.
Either you wash or discard it.

315
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay?

316
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,480
Okay?

317
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,640
Brother Velu,
you're lost in your thoughts.

318
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,840
Who am I?
I'm the temple trustee.

319
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,720
You come to me
for good and bad.

320
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
You came to me to check
for auspicious times.

321
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,000
You come to me
for prayer matters.

322
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,440
You come to me
for prayer matters.

323
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,200
Who is he?
–Whom are you referring to?

324
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,000
Appasamy.
The things you believe in,...

325
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,640
Appasamy.
The things you believe in,...

326
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,000
...he refutes them.
When there is a problem,...

327
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,120
...he refutes them.
When there is a problem,...

328
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,400
...people listen
to his advice and not mine.

329
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
In what way is he better than me?
–But what he says make sense.

330
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,440
In what way is he better than me?
–But what he says make sense.

331
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,840
Do you think Kolanji
would have brought Poongoodi?

332
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,000
He would have brought her.

333
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,960
He would have brought her.

334
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,760
Uncle!

335
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,520
One heroine is too much
for your face.

336
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,000
Two is absolutely absurd.

337
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,960
Two is absolutely absurd.

338
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,000
Jayanthi, is Poongoodi here?
–I'm standing in front of you.

339
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,880
Jayanthi, is Poongoodi here?
–I'm standing in front of you.

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,360
But you're asking for her.
She isn't here.

341
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,000
Uncle, give me a hand.

342
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,480
Uncle, give me a hand.

343
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,520
Careful.

344
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,000
I've seen this
in too many films.

345
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,600
I've seen this
in too many films.

346
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,000
Uncle, music over.
Hands off.

347
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,800
Uncle, music over.
Hands off.

348
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,000
Sit carefully.
–Make her sit down.

349
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,640
Sit carefully.
–Make her sit down.

350
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,000
Superstar has said that you should
marry the girl who loves you...

351
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
Superstar has said that you should
marry the girl who loves you...

352
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,000
...rather than the girl you love.
–Ilayadhalapathi said that...

353
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,200
...rather than the girl you love.
–Ilayadhalapathi said that...

354
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,680
...love blossoms only once.
What about that?

355
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm telling you that you should
jump into this river and die.

356
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,120
I'm telling you that you should
jump into this river and die.

357
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,560
Do that fast.
–There are butterflies...

358
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,000
...in my tummy when I see you.
What does that mean?

359
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,160
...in my tummy when I see you.
What does that mean?

360
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,840
It means you are purging.
–What about Poongoodi?

361
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,000
Poongoodi.....
–Thief!

362
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Poongoodi.....
–Thief!

363
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,000
I must push you into the water
and kill you.

364
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,000
God, I can't take this!

365
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,760
God, I can't take this!

366
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,400
Kolanji, safe me please!

367
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,760
Good, you fell.
–Can't you come 30 minutes later?

368
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,400
Let me go.
–Jayanthi, wait!

369
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,000
Me? Uncle! He left me
and gone skirt–chasing.

370
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,880
Me? Uncle! He left me
and gone skirt–chasing.

371
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,000
Hey, please give me a hand.

372
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,560
Hey, please give me a hand.

373
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,720
Kolanji, come on.
–Must I see this horrible...

374
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,000
...love scene from near?
–Welcome. Come in, my boy.

375
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,600
...love scene from near?
–Welcome. Come in, my boy.

376
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,160
Go and get coffee.
–No thanks.

377
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,200
I'm going to the market.

378
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,000
I thought
I'll pay you along the way.

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,280
I thought
I'll pay you along the way.

380
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,960
Come in, aunty.
–How are you?

381
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,000
Look at him drive
the tractor.

382
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,200
Look at him drive
the tractor.

383
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,840
Your nephew doesn't obey anyone.

384
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,000
How can you force
the college girl to collect dung?

385
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
How can you force
the college girl to collect dung?

386
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,520
Look at her clothes. Do you think
she would collect dung?

387
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,520
She is always playing
with these animals.

388
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,000
She doesn't want to allow us
to slaughter the animal.

389
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,760
She doesn't want to allow us
to slaughter the animal.

390
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,640
She is right.
It is a soul too.

391
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,000
It's wrong to kill it.
–You used to eat a whole goat.

392
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,120
It's wrong to kill it.
–You used to eat a whole goat.

393
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,720
Are you sure you're saying this?
–Mom, I swore to God...

394
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,000
...I won't eat meat hereafter.
I'm a vegetarian now.

395
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
...I won't eat meat hereafter.
I'm a vegetarian now.

396
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,000
We'll see how it goes.
Bye! Let's go.

397
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,360
We'll see how it goes.
Bye! Let's go.

398
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Why don't you eat before you go?
–No, Gemini wants to have...

399
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,000
...goat head curry. I have to cook
after I go to the market.

400
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,640
...goat head curry. I have to cook
after I go to the market.

401
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,000
I want you on my team.
You, you, you and you.

402
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,400
I want you on my team.
You, you, you and you.

403
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,000
Both of you, join the other team.
–Can I play too?

404
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,800
Both of you, join the other team.
–Can I play too?

405
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,200
I can't take you in. Go!
–Why can't my friend play with us?

406
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,000
You'll leave the game halfway
when you see your father.

407
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,760
You'll leave the game halfway
when you see your father.

408
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,720
Who will play with you?
–I'll play for him. Why feel bad?

409
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,000
We do not play with the kids
from your street. Please go.

410
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,200
We do not play with the kids
from your street. Please go.

411
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,680
Hey, wait.

412
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,000
Poikozhi(fake chicken),
why can't you play with them?

413
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,520
Poikozhi(fake chicken),
why can't you play with them?

414
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,000
Don't you dare call me Poikozhi!
–What will you do?

415
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,880
Don't you dare call me Poikozhi!
–What will you do?

416
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,840
Paneer, I'll play with them.
Come on, let's toss.

417
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,560
Flower!
–Batting!

418
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,000
Can't you catch the ball?
–Do you want me to pick his ball?

419
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,120
Can't you catch the ball?
–Do you want me to pick his ball?

420
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,560
Get lost!
–Why are you like this?

421
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,480
It feels great!

422
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,280
I get only 2 balls.
Give me a good ball.

423
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,000
Isn't this a good ball?

424
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,520
Isn't this a good ball?

425
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,800
Throw.

426
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,040
Here you go!

427
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,080
Kolanji, catch!
–Run, he won't catch!

428
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,200
Kolanji, your father
is coming.

429
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,000
Poikozhi, will you lie again?

430
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,600
Poikozhi, will you lie again?

431
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,480
Don't take matters
into your own hands!

432
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,000
They won't let go!
Smack him!

433
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,360
They won't let go!
Smack him!

434
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,000
Don't let him go!
Smack him!

435
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Don't let him go!
Smack him!

436
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,840
Don't let him go!
Smack him!

437
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,000
Let me go! No!

438
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
Let me go! No!

439
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,080
Let me go!

440
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,000
How dare you lie!
–Kolanji!

441
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,480
How dare you lie!
–Kolanji!

442
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
Neelavenny!

443
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,080
Neelavenny!

444
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,600
My friend let you go
because of Neelavenny.

445
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm letting you go
because of world peace.

446
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,360
I'm letting you go
because of world peace.

447
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,840
Just go.

448
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,240
Just you wait. You hit me, right?
I'll tell my father.

449
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,000
Watch what I do to you.

450
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,120
Watch what I do to you.

451
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,960
Appasamy! Come out!

452
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,840
What happened?
–Call the man out.

453
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,880
Honey!
–Vellappa, where is my respect?

454
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,280
Why do you need respect
when you have a devil for a son?

455
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,000
Please come in and talk.
–I'm not here to eat.

456
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,120
Please come in and talk.
–I'm not here to eat.

457
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,000
You advice everyone in town.
Won't you advice your son?

458
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,640
You advice everyone in town.
Won't you advice your son?

459
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,960
Brother, please don't be angry.
–How can I be calm?

460
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,000
Look what your son did to him.
–They are kids.

461
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,720
Look what your son did to him.
–They are kids.

462
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,120
They must have got hurt
while playing.

463
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,000
Why must we adults fight over it?
–Is he a respected man?

464
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,040
Why must we adults fight over it?
–Is he a respected man?

465
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,000
That's what you say
about him.

466
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,560
That's what you say
about him.

467
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,720
Look here, you fool!
If you touch him again,...

468
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,000
...I'll kill you
no matter who stands in my way.

469
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,800
...I'll kill you
no matter who stands in my way.

470
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,000
Why must you mix with hooligans?
I must smack you first! Go!

471
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,680
Why must you mix with hooligans?
I must smack you first! Go!

472
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,680
Even your son does not
listen to you,...

473
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,000
...but you are trying
to advice the people.

474
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,440
...but you are trying
to advice the people.

475
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,280
Useless!

476
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Let's go!

477
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,160
Let's go!

478
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,000
Can't you behave when you go out?
Why did you hit that man's son?

479
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,520
Can't you behave when you go out?
Why did you hit that man's son?

480
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,000
This is what
you do all the time.

481
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,440
This is what
you do all the time.

482
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,760
If you touch anyone again,
I'll break your hand.

483
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,000
This is what he does
during the holidays.

484
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,000
I wonder
why we have school holidays.

485
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,680
I wonder
why we have school holidays.

486
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,000
Hey! A man came to our house
and cussed because of your son.

487
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,000
You're pampering him
and not smacking him.

488
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,160
You're pampering him
and not smacking him.

489
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,000
Will he change if we smack him?
We have to guide him.

490
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,880
Will he change if we smack him?
We have to guide him.

491
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,840
I bet you'll guide him well.
You're the one spoiling him.

492
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,800
I wonder
why he became my son.

493
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,000
Come on, son.

494
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,440
Come on, son.

495
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:18,000
Mom, your rasam is tasteless.
–Oh God!

496
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,240
Mom, your rasam is tasteless.
–Oh God!

497
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,640
That is not right for you.
–What?

498
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,000
You'll know.
–Good.

499
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,400
You'll know.
–Good.

500
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,000
He'll start something nowfor what happened yesterday.

501
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,800
He'll start something nowfor what happened yesterday.

502
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,160
How will he nail me?

503
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,720
Pushpam!
–What is it?

504
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,760
Come closer.
–What for?

505
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,720
Did you do something wrong?
–No.

506
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,000
Why is your husband
staring at me?

507
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,120
Why is your husband
staring at me?

508
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Why look at him?
Just study.

509
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,200
Will you only absorb what
you're studying when you read...

510
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,440
...your book upside down?
You won't study during school days.

511
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,000
Why are you studying
during the holidays?

512
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,280
Why are you studying
during the holidays?

513
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,000
No, I'm holding the book
the right way.

514
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,520
Then why is the cover upside down?
–The government printed...

515
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,000
...a few pages upside down.
–Didn't you check before buying it?

516
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,040
...a few pages upside down.
–Didn't you check before buying it?

517
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,800
It's his book.
–He doesn't know anything.

518
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,840
You could have chosen
the right book for him.

519
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,000
But you do your mischief well.
I'll kill you if you spoil...

520
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,880
But you do your mischief well.
I'll kill you if you spoil...

521
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,680
...my name again.

522
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,680
Ice! Cone, milk,
cup and vermicelli ice cream!

523
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,440
What do you want?
–Will I ask gold from you?

524
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,000
I want an ice cream.
–Fine, pay me first.

525
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,320
I want an ice cream.
–Fine, pay me first.

526
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,000
It's a fine dagger.
One swing will do the job!

527
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,880
It's a fine dagger.
One swing will do the job!

528
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,280
Keep this and give us ice cream.
–We want ice cream too.

529
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,000
Get ice cream for all of us.
–Kolanji, don't do this.

530
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,360
Get ice cream for all of us.
–Kolanji, don't do this.

531
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,400
We sold our valour
and got us treats.

532
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,000
It's shameful.
–If it is shameful,...

533
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,360
It's shameful.
–If it is shameful,...

534
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,480
...give me your ice cream.
–I don't mind being shamed...

535
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,000
...for a friend.

536
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,040
...for a friend.

537
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,920
Mate! Hey!

538
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,000
What is it?
–Ask her where she is going?

539
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,440
What is it?
–Ask her where she is going?

540
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,000
Won't she hit me
if I call her that way?

541
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,160
Won't she hit me
if I call her that way?

542
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,800
I'm here, fear not.
Just call her.

543
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,000
Slow coach,
where are you going?

544
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,760
Slow coach,
where are you going?

545
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,520
Where are you trying to run?
–Please don't.

546
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,000
What did you say? Slow coach?
I'll tear your mouth.

547
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,560
Let him go!

548
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,120
Uncle! Hey!

549
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,000
She left 30 minutes ago.
Let me go at least now, traitor!

550
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,240
She left 30 minutes ago.
Let me go at least now, traitor!

551
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,880
Wait, I'm coming.

552
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,080
Please wait!

553
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,000
What is it, Muruga?
–Your son threatened me with this.

554
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,160
What is it, Muruga?
–Your son threatened me with this.

555
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,040
He gave all the ice creams
away to the kids.

556
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,000
I need to pay my boss.
I don't want to be scolded.

557
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,120
I need to pay my boss.
I don't want to be scolded.

558
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,240
Here.

559
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,000
Why do you have such a son?

560
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
Why do you have such a son?

561
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
Partner, did your son
cause trouble again?

562
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,160
Partner, did your son
cause trouble again?

563
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,000
How dare you touch my Thalai?
You won't have a head.

564
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,840
How dare you touch my Thalai?
You won't have a head.

565
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,000
Dad, he hit me.
–He hit my head.

566
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,920
Where is he?
–Eating inside.

567
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,000
You only fought
with people all along.

568
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,680
You have become a thief now
–Dad, he blew into my ears.

569
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,400
It hurts.
–Rascal, he'll do such things.

570
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,960
Are you a rogue to threaten
with a dagger?

571
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,640
Say something!

572
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,000
I wonder why you became my son.
I am humiliated wherever I go...

573
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,160
I wonder why you became my son.
I am humiliated wherever I go...

574
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,040
...because of you.
Why are you here?

575
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,600
You are incorrigible.
Rascal!

576
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,000
Interest!

577
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,720
Interest!

578
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,600
You left this morning,
you're coming home only now.

579
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,560
I can only come home
after I finish my work.

580
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,000
Rubbish! There is no end
to the work in your house.

581
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,560
Rubbish! There is no end
to the work in your house.

582
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,000
You must pick on my family.
Where is your brother?

583
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,040
You must pick on my family.
Where is your brother?

584
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,960
He left after dad hit him.

585
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,000
He is your son too just like him.
Why do you keep hitting him?

586
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,480
He is your son too just like him.
Why do you keep hitting him?

587
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,800
Do you expect me to keep quiet
and watch everything he does?

588
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,120
When he realises
he is wrong one day,...

589
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,760
...he may question me
for not trying to correct him.

590
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,000
If we ignore his mischief thinking
they are not serious,...

591
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,560
If we ignore his mischief thinking
they are not serious,...

592
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,480
...he will not know
which is right and wrong.

593
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,760
He is a small boy,
Kolanji is a big boy.

594
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,000
For him, Kolanji is a big boy.
But he is our baby too.

595
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,880
For him, Kolanji is a big boy.
But he is our baby too.

596
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
When did he leave?
–He got thrashed this afternoon.

597
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,160
When did he leave?
–He got thrashed this afternoon.

598
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,160
Then he left.

599
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,000
Where are you going
without cooking?

600
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,560
Where are you going
without cooking?

601
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,880
I'm going to pull a chariot.

602
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,000
Kolanji!

603
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,520
Kolanji!

604
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,560
Where did you go?
Kolanji!

605
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,000
Kolanji!

606
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,240
Kolanji!

607
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,200
Adivangi, did you see Kolanji?
–I saw him last in the afternoon.

608
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,360
He is a pain.
Venny, wait!

609
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,000
Neelavenny, did you see your uncle?
–He'll be roaming somewhere here.

610
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,160
Neelavenny, did you see your uncle?
–He'll be roaming somewhere here.

611
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,000
Where did you go at this hour?
–Grandma's house.

612
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,960
Where did you go at this hour?
–Grandma's house.

613
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,320
If you see him, tell him
I'm looking for him. Okay?

614
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,000
Okay, aunty.
–I wonder where he went.

615
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Okay, aunty.
–I wonder where he went.

616
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,320
Kolanji!

617
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,480
Aunty!
–What is it?

618
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Kolanji!

619
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,920
Where did you go?
I searched all over for you.

620
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,000
What is it?
Did dad hit you?

621
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,080
What is it?
Did dad hit you?

622
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,280
Look at me.
–I am his son too.

623
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,000
Why does he keep hitting me?
–He's only your father.

624
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,120
Why does he keep hitting me?
–He's only your father.

625
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,800
I don't want my father. Just go!
–You shouldn't say that.

626
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,000
You were wrong, so dad hit you.
Don't do anything bad anymore.

627
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,200
You were wrong, so dad hit you.
Don't do anything bad anymore.

628
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,000
He does wrong too.
But he corrects him patiently.

629
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,360
He does wrong too.
But he corrects him patiently.

630
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,000
He pampers him.
–Okay, don't cry.

631
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,440
He pampers him.
–Okay, don't cry.

632
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,040
Come on, mom.
Why did you marry him?

633
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,000
If you had married someone else,
I would have got a good father.

634
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,640
If you had married someone else,
I would have got a good father.

635
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,000
Because I married him,
you became my son.

636
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,160
Because I married him,
you became my son.

637
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,080
My baby!

638
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,000
Shall we eat?
Shall we go home? Let's go.

639
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,480
Shall we eat?
Shall we go home? Let's go.

640
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,000
Venny, you must
go home on time. Okay?

641
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,840
Venny, you must
go home on time. Okay?

642
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,800
Have you eaten, Neelavenny?

643
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,680
Let's go.

644
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,560
After being thrashed yesterday,
he lied that he wanted...

645
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,480
...to go to the toilet,
he went out to roam around instead.

646
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,000
He didn't go out to roam.
–What did he do then?

647
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,320
He didn't go out to roam.
–What did he do then?

648
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,560
He'll go to the boulder
just outside the village.

649
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,280
Why does he go there?
–No matter how much you hit him,...

650
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,000
...he won't cry when you hit him.
He'll go to the boulder...

651
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,400
...he won't cry when you hit him.
He'll go to the boulder...

652
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,400
...and cry his heart out there
where no one will see.

653
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,000
Did I go overboard yesterday?
–Yes, dad.

654
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Did I go overboard yesterday?
–Yes, dad.

655
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,480
I won't hit him again
no matter what he does.

656
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,000
Really?
–Yes.

657
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,120
Really?
–Yes.

658
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,000
Friend, she is here.
Shall we go?

659
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,200
Friend, she is here.
Shall we go?

660
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,880
Ask your sister
what she is buying.

661
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,000
No, let's see her
from this far.

662
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,200
No, let's see her
from this far.

663
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,600
If she does the cosmic dance
near us, I won't be able...

664
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,000
...to take it.
–Her thrashing is bearable.

665
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,160
...to take it.
–Her thrashing is bearable.

666
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,000
But when you see her close,
she looks worse than the ghost...

667
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,160
But when you see her close,
she looks worse than the ghost...

668
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,480
...in Conjuring.
Please try to understand.

669
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,000
When I'm here, will she.....

670
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,280
When I'm here, will she.....

671
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,080
I'm counting on you
to make my love a success.

672
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,000
You enjoy the girls,
he bears the brunt of it.

673
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,160
You enjoy the girls,
he bears the brunt of it.

674
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,720
No! We must stop this at once.
Kolanji, do something.

675
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,240
Meet her tomorrow
and propose to her.

676
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,000
Ask her for an answer.
–She'll hit me.

677
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,440
Ask her for an answer.
–She'll hit me.

678
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,640
One can murder you,
it's not wrong.

679
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,000
Use your sentiments on her.

680
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,520
Use your sentiments on her.

681
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,200
Girls prefer men who cry and beg
rather than the arrogant ones.

682
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,000
What do I do to cry?
–Send a voice message...

683
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,600
Must we get you married and pierce
the ears for your kids too?

684
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,000
Here, sweetened chili.
Rub in your eyes.

685
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,600
Here, sweetened chili.
Rub in your eyes.

686
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,040
You'll cry,
she'll fall for you.

687
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,000
What is it? Your uncle
is showing his back to me?

688
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,440
What is it? Your uncle
is showing his back to me?

689
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,880
He has not been able to eat
for the past 4 days because...

690
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,880
...he has been thinking about you.
He kept crying all the time.

691
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
As it is, his face is bad.
He has been crying for 4 days.

692
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,400
As it is, his face is bad.
He has been crying for 4 days.

693
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,320
How am I to see his face
in this condition?

694
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,000
Was he crying for 4 days
without eating?

695
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,840
Was he crying for 4 days
without eating?

696
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,720
I don't believe you.
–Who would fall for you?

697
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,000
Didn't we believe him
when he said so?

698
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,320
Didn't we believe him
when he said so?

699
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,120
You can see for yourself.
Uncle, turn around.

700
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,000
How come you are so fresh?
Rub the chili in your eyes.

701
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,480
How come you are so fresh?
Rub the chili in your eyes.

702
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,880
You didn't tell me how much to rub.
–Is that a cooking tip?

703
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,800
Just rub the chili
in your eyes and cry.

704
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,920
He is crying his heart out.

705
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,640
Uncle, love and sadness
should never be contained.

706
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,000
Let it all out.

707
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,760
Let it all out.

708
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,400
This is too much
for a small chili.

709
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,000
Why are you overacting?
–I think I rubbed too much.

710
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,560
Why are you overacting?
–I think I rubbed too much.

711
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,960
I can't open my eyes at all.
–Must you run like a monkey...

712
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,000
...and spoil it?
Just pretend to cry.

713
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,680
...and spoil it?
Just pretend to cry.

714
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,360
Poongoodi!
–She is over here.

715
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,000
Where is she?
–Poongoodi!

716
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,400
Where is she?
–Poongoodi!

717
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,000
Coconut tree. I escaped!
Poongoodi!

718
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,400
Coconut tree. I escaped!
Poongoodi!

719
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,000
When you were born,
your family introduced you to me...

720
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,200
When you were born,
your family introduced you to me...

721
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,560
...as my future wife.
–Good family.

722
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,000
But to you, they told you I'm
the bogeyman who would catch you...

723
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,040
But to you, they told you I'm
the bogeyman who would catch you...

724
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,720
...if you do not eat.

725
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,960
I used to act like a bogeyman.

726
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,000
You used to eat in fear.

727
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,120
You used to eat in fear.

728
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,800
I was happy as I thought
you were eating because of me.

729
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,040
Didn't you grow up at all?
–My love is true, Poongoodi.

730
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,000
Give me an answer fast.
Or I'll surely die.

731
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,080
Give me an answer fast.
Or I'll surely die.

732
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,000
Please do that.
–An adult man should not cry.

733
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,160
Please do that.
–An adult man should not cry.

734
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,000
Is it okay if I cry?
–Look at me.

735
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,240
Is it okay if I cry?
–Look at me.

736
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,000
Poongoodi, I can't see you
when I'm crying.

737
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,680
Poongoodi, I can't see you
when I'm crying.

738
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,000
Because there is that much
of pain in my eyes.

739
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,400
Because there is that much
of pain in my eyes.

740
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,880
Pain in your eyes?
–He means pain in his heart.

741
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,000
Fine, I'll marry you.
But on one condition.

742
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,360
Fine, I'll marry you.
But on one condition.

743
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,000
What is it?
–Did you watch Naiyandi?

744
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,160
What is it?
–Did you watch Naiyandi?

745
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,880
You mean the film acted
by Sivaji and Padmini?

746
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
That is Thillana Mohanambal.
This one is by Dhanush.

747
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,360
That is Thillana Mohanambal.
This one is by Dhanush.

748
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,240
We watched it, right?
–Dhanush will cross a well in it.

749
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,000
Yes.
–If your uncle crosses...

750
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,400
Yes.
–If your uncle crosses...

751
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,680
...the well in our village,
I'll marry him.

752
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,000
You could have told him
to kill himself instead.

753
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,240
You could have told him
to kill himself instead.

754
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,280
Is the chili still working?
Why are you still crying?

755
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,840
This is not fake tears,
but real tears.

756
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,000
I am really crying.
–You'll perform once...

757
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,400
I am really crying.
–You'll perform once...

758
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,800
...the scene is over.
My sister has left.

759
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,000
Why are you crying?
–You mean your family has no heart?

760
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,320
Why are you crying?
–You mean your family has no heart?

761
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,320
Look.

762
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
So many films
are being released.

763
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,000
But she is insisting that Dhanush
crossed the well...

764
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,160
But she is insisting that Dhanush
crossed the well...

765
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,560
...in Naiyandi. And she wants me
to cross this well just like him.

766
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,000
Your sister is terrible.
It's just my luck.

767
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,200
Your sister is terrible.
It's just my luck.

768
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,000
Be grateful your time is good.
Thank God my sister forgot Kuruvi.

769
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,560
Be grateful your time is good.
Thank God my sister forgot Kuruvi.

770
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,040
Why? Does the hero catch
birds in the movie.

771
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,000
It is better than this well.
–Didn't you watch any movies...

772
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,480
It is better than this well.
–Didn't you watch any movies...

773
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,840
...after Baasha?

774
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,000
Forget it. 2 months ago,
my sister and I watched...

775
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,400
Forget it. 2 months ago,
my sister and I watched...

776
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,120
...a Telugu film
in the local theatre.

777
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,000
There was a fat hero
in the film.

778
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,920
There was a fat hero
in the film.

779
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,520
He gave that look,...

780
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,360
...he stood that way.....

781
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,000
He shouted
and hit his thigh,...

782
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,400
He shouted
and hit his thigh,...

783
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,000
...and when he did this,...

784
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,800
...and when he did this,...

785
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,000
...the train will follow him.
Do you know that?

786
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,000
Oh my God!

787
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,680
Oh my God!

788
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:36,000
How will the train go behind him?
–It did. The film was a hit.

789
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,200
How will the train go behind him?
–It did. The film was a hit.

790
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:42,000
Now tell me, train or well?
–I think the well is better.

791
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,240
Now tell me, train or well?
–I think the well is better.

792
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,400
Great.
–Hanuman crossed the sea...

793
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,000
...to reach Lanka.
Can't you cross this small well?

794
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,240
...to reach Lanka.
Can't you cross this small well?

795
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,240
Tell me how to cross the well.
–Uncle is slaughtering a goat...

796
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,000
...in the temple tomorrow.
Eat well and come here.

797
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,120
...in the temple tomorrow.
Eat well and come here.

798
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,000
I'll give you an idea
the day after tomorrow.

799
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,440
I'll give you an idea
the day after tomorrow.

800
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,000
Pity the animal,
I wonder what sin it did.

801
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,080
Pity the animal,
I wonder what sin it did.

802
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,000
Just tell me, I'll rescue your goat
and send it somewhere else.

803
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,000
What do you say?

804
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,240
What do you say?

805
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,440
Have you crossed the well?

806
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:42,000
Who will rescue you tomorrow?
And you want to rescue my goat?

807
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,080
Who will rescue you tomorrow?
And you want to rescue my goat?

808
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,000
What is it?
Today, it is the goat.

809
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,120
What is it?
Today, it is the goat.

810
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,960
Tomorrow, it will be you.

811
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,280
He came to the temple,
that is good enough.

812
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,000
Why do you look prettier today?
Did you powder your face?

813
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,440
Why do you look prettier today?
Did you powder your face?

814
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,000
What do you want now?
–She's a collector.

815
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,040
What do you want now?
–She's a collector.

816
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,920
I have to be nice to her
and get whatever I want.

817
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,240
It's true.
–I'll give you ribs later.

818
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,000
Don't bend too much,
you'll sprain your neck.

819
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,520
Don't bend too much,
you'll sprain your neck.

820
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,200
Can't you even lift that?
If you have to lift a boulder...

821
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,000
..before you get married, you'll be
a bachelor your whole life.

822
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,600
..before you get married, you'll be
a bachelor your whole life.

823
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,560
Lift a boulder? He can't even
tie his lungi properly.

824
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,000
Why? Did you tie for him?

825
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,400
Why? Did you tie for him?

826
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,080
Ask him
if I had tied it for him.

827
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,680
Come here, everyone,
let's pray.

828
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,960
Done!

829
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,000
Someone said he won't go to the
temple and apply temple offering.

830
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,600
Someone said he won't go to the
temple and apply temple offering.

831
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:54,000
But he is eating temple food.
His principles keep changing.

832
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,400
But he is eating temple food.
His principles keep changing.

833
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,520
We were invited
out of respect.

834
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,000
Eat, wash your hands
and leave, okay?

835
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,480
Eat, wash your hands
and leave, okay?

836
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,000
Why do you like to insult
people wherever you go?

837
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,160
Why do you like to insult
people wherever you go?

838
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,960
Don't spoil it when
you are invited out of respect.

839
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,000
I love what I am seeing.
Will he cross the well?

840
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,520
I love what I am seeing.
Will he cross the well?

841
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,000
You were supposed to give him
an idea on how to cross the well.

842
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,680
You were supposed to give him
an idea on how to cross the well.

843
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,600
What was the idea?

844
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,000
If you want to cross
this huge well,...

845
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,840
If you want to cross
this huge well,...

846
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,040
...either you must be
Superman or Spiderman.

847
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,000
Or you must be Superstar.
–If I am not one?

848
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,120
Or you must be Superstar.
–If I am not one?

849
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,760
You must keep quiet then.
You can't cross the well.

850
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
How can you keep
switching your words?

851
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,920
How can you keep
switching your words?

852
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,880
How am I to make
my love successful?

853
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
There is one way.

854
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,440
There is one way.

855
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,000
What idea is it?
–Look over there.

856
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,440
What idea is it?
–Look over there.

857
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,000
Poongoodi!

858
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,120
Poongoodi!

859
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,000
Shameless man! You could have
just jumped into the well.

860
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,200
Shameless man! You could have
just jumped into the well.

861
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,320
No Fair &amp; Lovely...

862
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,680
I don't want Fairever either...

863
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,000
Just touch me,that's enough...

864
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Just touch me,that's enough...

865
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,960
No Complan or Horlicks...

866
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,640
No Kashmir apples either...

867
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,000
I'll be strong when you smile...

868
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,720
I'll be strong when you smile...

869
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,440
I can't sleepbecause of you...

870
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,920
My name in town is gone....

871
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,280
Like gum that doesn't stick...

872
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,120
I become dry...

873
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,000
No Fair &amp; Lovely...

874
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,440
No Fair &amp; Lovely...

875
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,800
No Fairever either...

876
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,000
Just touch me is enough...

877
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,840
Just touch me is enough...

878
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,000
Okay...

879
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,280
Okay...

880
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,000
Great...

881
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,400
Great...

882
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,680
Tie the thali...

883
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,000
Exchange garlands...

884
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,320
Exchange garlands...

885
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,600
After marriage...

886
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,200
Let's relax...

887
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,000
Tie the thali...

888
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,520
Tie the thali...

889
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,040
Exchange garlands...

890
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,000
After marriage...

891
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,280
After marriage...

892
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,080
Let's relax...

893
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,440
As the bride groom...

894
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,000
I touch your hands...

895
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,960
I touch your hands...

896
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,200
You can lay on my chest...

897
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,000
I'll sing love songs...

898
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,800
I'll sing love songs...

899
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,560
I'll relaxwhile you lay on my shoulder...

900
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,000
We must go to the theatre...

901
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,160
We must go to the theatre...

902
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,600
We'll have vada...

903
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,000
We learnt about love slowly...

904
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,160
We learnt about love slowly...

905
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,760
The matinee show...

906
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,000
Under dim lights...

907
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,280
Under dim lights...

908
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,000
We kiss each other...

909
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,480
We kiss each other...

910
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,400
Friend, God cheated me.
–What happened?

911
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,000
Results are out.
I failed.

912
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,400
Results are out.
I failed.

913
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,000
You failed, why blame the Man
who does not exist? Poor thing!

914
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,360
You failed, why blame the Man
who does not exist? Poor thing!

915
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,360
You talk very well.

916
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,400
I can accept it that God has
cheated me.

917
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,000
But you said you'd pass,
I can't accept that...

918
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,520
But you said you'd pass,
I can't accept that...

919
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,320
...my friend has cheated me.

920
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,000
What are you saying?
–You failed too, friend.

921
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,200
What are you saying?
–You failed too, friend.

922
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:23,040
I failed? Must be
the science teacher's mischief.

923
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,000
Let school reopen,
watch what I do to him.

924
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,120
Let school reopen,
watch what I do to him.

925
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,520
Instead of thinking what you want
to do to the science teacher...

926
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,400
...after school reopens,
think of a way to escape...

927
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,000
...from your father
when you go home.

928
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,720
...from your father
when you go home.

929
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,200
It is not right.
–What?

930
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,000
Let father come home tonight,
you'll know then.

931
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,600
Let father come home tonight,
you'll know then.

932
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:59,080
Someone saw Ajith's films,
then got thrashed by his father.

933
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,760
Did you check the results?
–Before I saw that I passed,...

934
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,120
...I saw that you failed.
–Please don't tell dad tonight.

935
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,000
No, I won't tell him tonight.
–Thanks.

936
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,600
No, I won't tell him tonight.
–Thanks.

937
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,240
I called and told him
this morning.

938
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,000
Can we let it explode?

939
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,800
Can we let it explode?

940
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,800
Won't you ever listen?

941
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,000
Do you get milk from it?
If you suck your thumb again,...

942
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Do you get milk from it?
If you suck your thumb again,...

943
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,800
...I'll burn you with a hot rod.
–Try, then you'll know.

944
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,000
Do you think I won't do it?
–Why are you fighting with him?

945
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,080
Do you think I won't do it?
–Why are you fighting with him?

946
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,000
Once you hear the third whistle,
turn off the stove.

947
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,120
Once you hear the third whistle,
turn off the stove.

948
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,280
I'll go and feed the cow.

949
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,000
What are you doing?
–I want to threaten to burn him...

950
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,360
What are you doing?
–I want to threaten to burn him...

951
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,520
...with this hot rod.
–Really?

952
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,320
Yes. Come on.

953
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,720
Are you going to remove
your thumb from your mouth...

954
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,800
...or shall I burn you?
–You'd better go...

955
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,000
...or I'll tell my dad.
–If you tell your dad,...

956
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,160
...or I'll tell my dad.
–If you tell your dad,...

957
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,240
...do you think I will be scared?
–Let me go!

958
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,720
Dad!
–Try doing it again!

959
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,000
Let me go!
–Catch hold of him!

960
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,880
Let me go!
–Catch hold of him!

961
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,520
Let me go!
–I've told many times not to do it.

962
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,560
Lenin, why are you crying?
What happened?

963
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,680
Honey!

964
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,000
What is this? Who did this?
–Hear me out first.

965
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,720
What is this? Who did this?
–Hear me out first.

966
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,000
She is too much!
–How can you hit a grown up girl?

967
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,640
She is too much!
–How can you hit a grown up girl?

968
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,280
Don't you have sense?
–I have no sense?

969
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,000
She burnt the boy's hand.
You should have smacked her.

970
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,400
She burnt the boy's hand.
You should have smacked her.

971
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,720
She didn't do it on purpose.
It was an accident.

972
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,960
Will she eat dung unknowingly?
–This is a small matter,...

973
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,720
...don't make it big.
–What is a small matter?

974
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,600
She burnt my son's hand
and it is a small matter.

975
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,320
I hit your brother's daughter
and it is a big issue, right?

976
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,840
Who asked you to come here?
Fool! Get lost!

977
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,320
Don't behave like a brute!
–Am I a brute?

978
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,000
Yes!
–He is still a baby.

979
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yes!
–He is still a baby.

980
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,040
Are you supporting her
and fighting with me?

981
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,360
None of the 'dogs' from your side
must come to my house.

982
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,000
What did you say?
Whom did you call a 'dog'?

983
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,720
What did you say?
Whom did you call a 'dog'?

984
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,680
If one of your family members
had done this,...

985
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,000
...would you have said this?
You're looking down on my family.

986
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,280
...would you have said this?
You're looking down on my family.

987
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,960
Yes, who came to help me
when I was in trouble?

988
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,000
I get so angry when I see them.

989
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I get so angry when I see them.

990
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,000
When you have so much of hatred,
you put on a false smile all along.

991
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,880
When you have so much of hatred,
you put on a false smile all along.

992
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Right, that's true. Go!
–So you were pretending all along.

993
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,640
Right, that's true. Go!
–So you were pretending all along.

994
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,200
Hey!
–You kept saying...

995
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,000
...you're the brightest in town,
but you had muck inside.

996
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,960
...you're the brightest in town,
but you had muck inside.

997
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,960
You had a false smile outside
and had something else...

998
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,000
...inside your heart.

999
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,840
...inside your heart.

1000
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,680
Don't!
–Keep quiet!

1001
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,000
Just go.
–You're like any other men.

1002
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,880
Just go.
–You're like any other men.

1003
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,000
I feel ashamed I've been living
with a despicable man like you...

1004
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,280
I feel ashamed I've been living
with a despicable man like you...

1005
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,440
...all this while.

1006
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,920
Mom! Mom, wait!

1007
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,760
Mom! Mom, where are you going?

1008
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,000
Kolanji!

1009
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,600
Kolanji!

1010
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,000
What did you buy?
It isn't hot at all.

1011
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,320
What did you buy?
It isn't hot at all.

1012
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,000
Mom, what is happening here?
And you're complaining...

1013
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Mom, what is happening here?
And you're complaining...

1014
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,640
...about the betel leaves.

1015
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,280
I told you not
to get her married to him.

1016
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,000
You did not listen to me.
No one listens to me.

1017
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
You did not listen to me.
No one listens to me.

1018
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,720
I only had respect
when he was around.

1019
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,000
If your father was around,
this won't be happening.

1020
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,160
If your father was around,
this won't be happening.

1021
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,000
If my husband was alive,this wouldn't have happened...

1022
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,880
If my husband was alive,this wouldn't have happened...

1023
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,000
My daughter wouldn't haveleft her husband...

1024
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,040
My daughter wouldn't haveleft her husband...

1025
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,000
If you don't stop now,
I'll kill you with this needle.

1026
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,760
If you don't stop now,
I'll kill you with this needle.

1027
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,000
The murderer may kill me,
I'd better shut up.

1028
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,560
The murderer may kill me,
I'd better shut up.

1029
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,000
What happened now, Pushpam.
Who doesn't hit his wife?

1030
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,520
What happened now, Pushpam.
Who doesn't hit his wife?

1031
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,760
How can you leave him
because of this?

1032
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,000
My husband wasn't like
any other man.

1033
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,040
My husband wasn't like
any other man.

1034
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,040
He never even scolded me
from the day we got married.

1035
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,000
But yesterday.....

1036
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,320
But yesterday.....

1037
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,000
Okay, forget it.
He hit you in anger.

1038
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,000
No matter what you say,
he is a man.

1039
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,120
No matter what you say,
he is a man.

1040
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,920
If he is a man,
must he hit my mother?

1041
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,800
I kept quiet when he hit me.

1042
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,000
But I won't keep quiet
if he hits my mother.

1043
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,160
But I won't keep quiet
if he hits my mother.

1044
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,040
He smacked her so hard. The thought
of it makes me wince in pain.

1045
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,000
You're just a boy, keep quiet.
–Why must I keep quiet?

1046
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,040
You're just a boy, keep quiet.
–Why must I keep quiet?

1047
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,120
He'll beat my mom like a cow
and you'll say it is fine.

1048
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,000
Then who will voice out for my mom?
For you, your sister...

1049
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,080
Then who will voice out for my mom?
For you, your sister...

1050
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,600
...might not be important.
But my mother is everything to me.

1051
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,440
I can't take it
if anything happens to my mom.

1052
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,000
She is the cause of everything.
Let the boy do whatever he wants.

1053
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,120
She is the cause of everything.
Let the boy do whatever he wants.

1054
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,880
Why do you care?
–Must he hit a young girl?

1055
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,960
If she goes there again,
I'll break her leg.

1056
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,320
We have nothing to do with them
anymore, why would Chitra go there?

1057
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,720
Keep quiet, let us talk.

1058
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,000
Shall I talk to him?
–No one needs to talk to him...

1059
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,040
Shall I talk to him?
–No one needs to talk to him...

1060
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,520
...because of me.
Until he realises his mistake...

1061
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,000
...and comes for me,
I won't go back.

1062
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,160
...and comes for me,
I won't go back.

1063
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,760
Don't talk about
this anymore.

1064
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,000
Chitra, turn on the TV.
I want to watch serials.

1065
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,080
Chitra, turn on the TV.
I want to watch serials.

1066
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,000
Uncle! What is this?

1067
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,360
Uncle! What is this?

1068
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,360
There is no one home, right?

1069
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,000
What? I am here, you fool!
Cover up!

1070
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,240
What? I am here, you fool!
Cover up!

1071
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,000
Forget it! Let's go.
–Where?

1072
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,240
Forget it! Let's go.
–Where?

1073
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,240
To meet your sister.

1074
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,360
Hi, what brings you here?
–Nothing really.

1075
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,000
Kolanji has been purging
since morning.

1076
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,280
Kolanji has been purging
since morning.

1077
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,800
I told him I'll take him
to the clinic.

1078
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,680
But he said he'd rather take
the medicine that you make.

1079
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,000
How do you feel now?

1080
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,960
How do you feel now?

1081
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,800
You have a tummy problem.

1082
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,640
Your parents have a problem
in their heads.

1083
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,000
Don't blame Pushpam. Your brother
made a mistake by hitting her.

1084
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,080
Don't blame Pushpam. Your brother
made a mistake by hitting her.

1085
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,240
Come in.
–Why are you holding the broom...

1086
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,000
...when our groom is here?
Put that down.

1087
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,080
...when our groom is here?
Put that down.

1088
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,320
Kolanji is purging.
Get him some medicine.

1089
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,000
Poongoodi, Kolanji is purging.
Get him some medicine.

1090
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,440
Poongoodi, Kolanji is purging.
Get him some medicine.

1091
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,840
I'll tie the goat.
–Don't bother, I'll get it myself.

1092
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,000
My dad will be back now.
–Let him come.

1093
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,040
My dad will be back now.
–Let him come.

1094
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,440
I can hear my mother walking back.
–Let it be.

1095
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,160
Don't you have
anything better to do?

1096
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,000
Did Poongoodi give it to you?
–She sure did, lots of it.

1097
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,120
Did Poongoodi give it to you?
–She sure did, lots of it.

1098
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,000
Really? Everything
should have a limit.

1099
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,360
Really? Everything
should have a limit.

1100
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,400
Only then, it will work well.

1101
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,640
It is working fine now.
–Right.

1102
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,000
I've taught my daughter to give
the right amount at all times.

1103
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,960
I've taught my daughter to give
the right amount at all times.

1104
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,200
She'd have given the right amount.
–Great!

1105
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,000
Have another dose tomorrow.
–Another dose tomorrow?

1106
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,200
Have another dose tomorrow.
–Another dose tomorrow?

1107
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,920
What he took now
will be effective for another year.

1108
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,000
Uncle, our job here is done.
Let's go.

1109
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,840
Uncle, our job here is done.
Let's go.

1110
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,000
Your leg slipped.
Sit, have a drink before you go.

1111
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,480
Your leg slipped.
Sit, have a drink before you go.

1112
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,400
Poongoodi, get some water
for your cousin.

1113
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,000
Another replay?

1114
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,480
Another replay?

1115
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,640
And slow motion too?

1116
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,800
Dad, the bird got our chic.

1117
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,320
Where? I can't see anything.
–Both are right here.

1118
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,000
Why are you looking over there?
Great!

1119
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:24,960
Why are you looking over there?
Great!

1120
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,960
Uncle, my tummy feels better
but my chest hurts.

1121
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,880
Let's go.

1122
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,000
Why are we so serious?

1123
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,080
Why are we so serious?

1124
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,680
We have come
to the enemy's house to rob.

1125
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,000
That is the reason.
–Why have we painted our faces?

1126
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,520
That is the reason.
–Why have we painted our faces?

1127
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,840
No one should identify us.
That is the reason.

1128
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,000
When they look at me from afar,
they'll know who I am.

1129
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,080
When they look at me from afar,
they'll know who I am.

1130
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,040
Just keep going.

1131
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:06,000
He took away Ajith's photo
and pasted Thalapathy's photo here.

1132
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,320
He took away Ajith's photo
and pasted Thalapathy's photo here.

1133
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,000
These clothes belong
to the man and his son.

1134
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,080
These clothes belong
to the man and his son.

1135
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,400
Why do they need so many pairs?
My mom has no clothes over there.

1136
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,000
Remove everything.
He is the cause of everything.

1137
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,680
Remove everything.
He is the cause of everything.

1138
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,320
Mess up everything. He must only
wear soiled clothes hereafter.

1139
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,000
Get your father's clothes too,
we'll step on them too.

1140
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,440
Get your father's clothes too,
we'll step on them too.

1141
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,120
Your father may come, let's go.
–Right.

1142
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,000
Hold the bag.
–Give me.

1143
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,200
Your father made you steal
from your own house.

1144
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,000
Get that too.

1145
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,160
Get that too.

1146
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,880
Every dog will have its day.

1147
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,000
But still,
I need to show who I am.

1148
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,960
But still,
I need to show who I am.

1149
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,000
Look, Your father got You
a peacock figurine.

1150
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,000
Enjoy!

1151
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,400
Enjoy!

1152
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,840
I have a doubt.

1153
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,240
Friend, the sorrow caused by
our failure is nothing compared...

1154
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,000
...to the joy
that our friend has failed too.

1155
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,160
...to the joy
that our friend has failed too.

1156
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,000
Why?
–If I had stayed at home...

1157
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,000
...after failing my exam, my father
would have smacked me, right?

1158
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,800
...after failing my exam, my father
would have smacked me, right?

1159
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,080
Confirmed death.
–He just hates the sight of me.

1160
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,000
Whatever I do is wrong in his eye.
If I ever see him,...

1161
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,120
Whatever I do is wrong in his eye.
If I ever see him,...

1162
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,160
...I'll fix him good.

1163
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,000
It is wrong to hit a woman
no matter what you say.

1164
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,840
It is wrong. I didn't know
what I was doing in anger.

1165
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,000
But she knows me better than me.
Can she leave just like that?

1166
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,640
But she knows me better than me.
Can she leave just like that?

1167
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,240
That's true.
Women get angry easily.

1168
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,000
We have to be patient.
If we get angry too,...

1169
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,640
She left, I bet she knows
how to come back.

1170
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,840
She'll be back.

1171
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,920
Why do you have such a big rock?
–Did my mother ask you...

1172
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,000
...to path up her relationship
with that man?

1173
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,360
...to path up her relationship
with that man?

1174
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,280
You won't know now
when things are fine.

1175
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,560
Only when we are down,
we'll know the value of our family.

1176
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,000
We don't need to know anything,
just mind your business.

1177
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,920
We don't need to know anything,
just mind your business.

1178
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,240
The peacemaker has come.

1179
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,560
They are coming to shoot
a film in our village.

1180
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,000
Who is the hero?
–Vijay is coming.

1181
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:48,960
Who is the hero?
–Vijay is coming.

1182
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,040
No, I heard Ajith is coming.
–Isn't MGR coming?

1183
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,000
Will Namitha be here?
–It'll be great if she comes.

1184
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,200
Will Namitha be here?
–It'll be great if she comes.

1185
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,040
Then who is coming?

1186
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,000
Will you talk in Tamil
with a white man?

1187
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,240
Will you talk in Tamil
with a white man?

1188
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,000
Mr. Sengarayan,
costume change!

1189
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,280
Mr. Sengarayan,
costume change!

1190
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,560
I'll be in Switzerland
on that date.

1191
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,000
Talk to my manager
if there is anything.

1192
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,560
Talk to my manager
if there is anything.

1193
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,480
Here. If he calls again,
don't answer.

1194
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,480
God morning, brother.

1195
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,000
Sengarayan, what is this?
–I beg your pardon.

1196
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,040
Sengarayan, what is this?
–I beg your pardon.

1197
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,000
What is this?

1198
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,040
What is this?

1199
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:42,000
It's an umbrella.
–I know it's an umbrella.

1200
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:42,080
It's an umbrella.
–I know it's an umbrella.

1201
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,000
Why are you holding it
at this hour?

1202
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,000
Mudarkudam 2, song 5,
take one.

1203
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:48,800
Mudarkudam 2, song 5,
take one.

1204
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,400
We are the first raceon Earth...

1205
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,000
We are anothername for humaneness...

1206
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,640

01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,720

We are the childrenof equality...

1212
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,520
We are the childrenof equality...

1213
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,520
We'll walkwith our heads up...

1214
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,440
We are Tamilan...

1215
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,000

1223
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,920

True Tamilan...

1226
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,480
You knew you can't talk Tamil
to an Englishman...

1227
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,000
...who can't speak Tamil.
How come you didn't know...

1228
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,120
...who can't speak Tamil.
How come you didn't know...

1229
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:40,520
...you can't speak in English to
a Tamilan who can't speak English.

1230
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,000
Tamil taughtall the living things...

1231
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,240
Tamil taughtall the living things...

1232
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,080
Respect everyone on Earth...

1233
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,000
Tamilan said that...

1234
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,440
Tamilan said that...

1235
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,120
Tamil gave priorityto education...

1236
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,000
He did not have boundaries...

1237
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,640
He did not have boundaries...

1238
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,080
The world was his world...

1239
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,000
Some plans are meantto oppress people...

1240
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,240
Some plans are meantto oppress people...

1241
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,360
Burn them down...

1242
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,000
Make Tamil the officiallanguage for sparrows...

1243
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,880

True Tamilan...

1274
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,800
This song is overrated for him.

1275
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,600
Pack up!

1276
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Lenin! Are you sick?

1277
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,040
Lenin! Are you sick?

1278
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,400
I am hungry, dad.

1279
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:36,000
I didn't realise anything
when we shouted slogans...

1280
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,520
I didn't realise anything
when we shouted slogans...

1281
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,000
...to gain independence
from the whites.

1282
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,360
...to gain independence
from the whites.

1283
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,040
Now I know the true meaning
of independence.

1284
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,000
We even chased the whites,
but not your father.

1285
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,720
We even chased the whites,
but not your father.

1286
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,560
He is right behind us.

1287
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,760
Watch me now.

1288
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:11,560
Adivangi, ask him to move.
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.

1289
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:12,000
Your brother is very upset.
–Listen to me.

1290
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,160
Your brother is very upset.
–Listen to me.

1291
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,000
Left!

1292
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,680
Left!

1293
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,840
Right!
–Adivangi, move!

1294
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,000
How is the reaction behind?
–Your brother is rather violent.

1295
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,480
How is the reaction behind?
–Your brother is rather violent.

1296
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,200
But your father is silent.
–Listen, I won't be calm.

1297
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,000
That is why I am scared.
–How is it?

1298
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,920
That is why I am scared.
–How is it?

1299
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,000
Awful!
–Why is the sound moving back?

1300
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,400
Awful!
–Why is the sound moving back?

1301
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,000
Your father is afraid of me.
He is going back.

1302
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:42,760
Your father is afraid of me.
He is going back.

1303
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,080
Come in.
–Vanakkam.

1304
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,000
Mani, looks like
business is good.

1305
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,760
Mani, looks like
business is good.

1306
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,200
You were worried that no one
will come to your restaurant...

1307
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,000
...in the village.
Are you happy now?

1308
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,680
...in the village.
Are you happy now?

1309
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,960
Murugan's wife has gone to deliver.
So, he has his meals here.

1310
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,480
When she is back next month,
he won't come anymore.

1311
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,640
Business is bad.
–She'll come back...

1312
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,000
...as she has only gone to deliver.
What about the wife who fought...

1313
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,520
...as she has only gone to deliver.
What about the wife who fought...

1314
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:29,880
...with her husband?
You have 2 permanent customers.

1315
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Bye! Ask him to eat
with more salt and tamarind.

1316
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,840
I told you many times
not to get on the tractor.

1317
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,000
The steering will get spoilt.
You spoilt the TV last week...

1318
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
The steering will get spoilt.
You spoilt the TV last week...

1319
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,120
...and I had to spend Rs2000.
Spoil this too.

1320
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,000
I'll bear the cost.
Why are you torturing me?

1321
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,240
I'll bear the cost.
Why are you torturing me?

1322
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,160
What did I do now?
I'm sitting down quietly.

1323
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,680
When have you been quiet?
You're always up to mischief.

1324
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,000
Look, don't scold me.
You have no right to scold me.

1325
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,080
Look, don't scold me.
You have no right to scold me.

1326
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,320
You're staying at my house and
you're telling me I have no right?

1327
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,000
Why are you scolding him now?
Please tell me whatever it is.

1328
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,480
Why are you scolding him now?
Please tell me whatever it is.

1329
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,800
Why must I tell you? He's naughty.
As his uncle, can't I yell at him?

1330
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,000
You have no right
to scold your nephew.

1331
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,040
You have no right
to scold your nephew.

1332
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,560
But you have all the right to talk
to your sister and ask her...

1333
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,000
...to go back to her husband.
If your daughter comes back,...

1334
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,080
...to go back to her husband.
If your daughter comes back,...

1335
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:30,000
...would you keep quiet?
–You are so eager to drive us out.

1336
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,120
...would you keep quiet?
–You are so eager to drive us out.

1337
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,200
If it is tough to live with us,
give us mom's share...

1338
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,920
...of the property. We'll go.
–Many orphans are yearning...

1339
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,000
...for their parents. But you don't
want to go back to your father.

1340
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,520
...for their parents. But you don't
want to go back to your father.

1341
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,160
Yes, I don't want
to go back to him.

1342
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,800
I only want my mother.
I don't want my father.

1343
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,000
Why? So that
you can roam around?

1344
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,280
Why? So that
you can roam around?

1345
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,880
Pushpam, go and live
with your husband.

1346
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Let him stay here.
–Do you want me to leave...

1347
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,440
Let him stay here.
–Do you want me to leave...

1348
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,440
...my son here alone? If you think
we are a burden to you,...

1349
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,000
...we'll leave right now.
–Who said they are a burden to us?

1350
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,480
...we'll leave right now.
–Who said they are a burden to us?

1351
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,000
Just go inside.
–We can't say anything.

1352
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,440
Just go inside.
–We can't say anything.

1353
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,000
Boss! When did the movie start?
–It started 30 minutes ago.

1354
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,400
Boss! When did the movie start?
–It started 30 minutes ago.

1355
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,560
I mean our film.
–Boss, this is the first time...

1356
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,000
...I brought my cousin out,
I'm watching a movie...

1357
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,160
...I brought my cousin out,
I'm watching a movie...

1358
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,200
...in an area
where there are not many people.

1359
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,000
Please try to understand.
–You can continue, boss.

1360
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,080
Please try to understand.
–You can continue, boss.

1361
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,000
Let's go and sit over there.
–Why?

1362
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,280
Let's go and sit over there.
–Why?

1363
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,000
Too many bugs here.
Come on!

1364
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:17,720
Come on, boss.
–Boss, what is your problem?

1365
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,000
No problem, boss, you continue.
Come on!

1366
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,480
No problem, boss, you continue.
Come on!

1367
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,880
Boss, please!

1368
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,440
Okay, boss, you continue.

1369
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,000
Too many bugs here too.
Let's go elsewhere.

1370
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,680
Too many bugs here too.
Let's go elsewhere.

1371
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,160
You continue.

1372
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,000
Boss, will there be an interval.
–Boss, I haven't start the movie.

1373
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,480
Boss, will there be an interval.
–Boss, I haven't start the movie.

1374
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,000
Go and sit over there.
–One ticket, 3 films. Super, boss!

1375
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,520
Go and sit over there.
–One ticket, 3 films. Super, boss!

1376
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,000
Boss, can you let me know
when you reach your climax?

1377
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:06,920
Boss, can you let me know
when you reach your climax?

1378
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,000
Okay, boss,
you can continue.

1379
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,440
Okay, boss,
you can continue.

1380
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:23,320
Hey, I have a gift for you.

1381
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,000
Amla?

1382
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,000
Chips? Vada?
–Crazy girl.

1383
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,400
Chips? Vada?
–Crazy girl.

1384
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,840
Give me your hand.

1385
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:06,000
Kolanji! Hey!

1386
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:06,880
Kolanji! Hey!

1387
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:10,160
Hey, Kolanji!

1388
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,000
Your sister and uncle
are misbehaving in the theatre.

1389
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,160
Your sister and uncle
are misbehaving in the theatre.

1390
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,840
Your sister is kissing him.
But you are swimming here.

1391
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:18,000
I knew about it.
–Will they do this and keep away...

1392
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,560
I knew about it.
–Will they do this and keep away...

1393
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,720
...or will they get married?
–How can that be so?

1394
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:24,000
I got them together. Of course
I want them to get married.

1395
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,800
I got them together. Of course
I want them to get married.

1396
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,480
Or I'll rip them apart.
–Oh my God!

1397
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,000
What happened?
–If they get married,...

1398
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,760
What happened?
–If they get married,...

1399
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,440
...your parents
will make peace again.

1400
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,000
Then your father
will smack you till you die.

1401
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,000
If they get married,
how will that help my parents?

1402
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,360
If they get married,
how will that help my parents?

1403
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,960
Do you have sense? I'll tell you
a short story, listen.

1404
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,000
My father and mother went separate
ways because they didn't have...

1405
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:42,640
My father and mother went separate
ways because they didn't have...

1406
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,640
...kids at first. They met again
during my grandma's funeral.

1407
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,000
Then my relatives advised them
and got them together again.

1408
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,800
Then my relatives advised them
and got them together again.

1409
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,120
Your parents will meet
during this wedding.

1410
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,000
What if someone brings
them together again?

1411
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,760
What if someone brings
them together again?

1412
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,080
What will you do? They got
my parents together in a funeral.

1413
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,000
Do you think your relatives
will keep quiet during a wedding?

1414
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,160
Do you think your relatives
will keep quiet during a wedding?

1415
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,280
What are you thinking?
–I'm looking for a way...

1416
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,000
...to break them up.

1417
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,680
...to break them up.

1418
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,000
Why is Bullet getting on the bus?
–The bus shouldn't get on a Bullet.

1419
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,720
Why is Bullet getting on the bus?
–The bus shouldn't get on a Bullet.

1420
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,480
Here.

1421
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,880
Pushpam, there is space
beside your husband.

1422
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,160
Can you sit there?

1423
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,000
Why are you thinking twice
to sit next to your husband?

1424
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,120
Why are you thinking twice
to sit next to your husband?

1425
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,000
Madam, sit here.

1426
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,600
Madam, sit here.

1427
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,000
Why are you walking past
as if you can't see me?

1428
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,040
Why are you walking past
as if you can't see me?

1429
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,800
Why are you staring?

1430
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,400
If I don't tell you,
you'll hit me.

1431
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,000
If I tell, uncle will hit me.
Am I your punching bag?

1432
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,120
If I tell, uncle will hit me.
Am I your punching bag?

1433
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,640
If you tell,
uncle will hit you? Why?

1434
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,000
If you know he drinks and smokes,
you will not marry him.

1435
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,720
If you know he drinks and smokes,
you will not marry him.

1436
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:41,560
That is the reason.
–What? He smokes and drinks?

1437
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,000
Tell me the truth.
–Check if you don't trust me.

1438
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,280
Tell me the truth.
–Check if you don't trust me.

1439
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,000
What is this?
–This is used for smoking.

1440
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:48,320
What is this?
–This is used for smoking.

1441
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:52,680
This is for liquor.
–And this one?

1442
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,000
Herbs.
–What is this for?

1443
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,320
Herbs.
–What is this for?

1444
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,480
If you chew on this after drinking
liquor, there won't be any smell.

1445
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:00,000
Not only that.....
–What is it? Tell me.

1446
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,520
Not only that.....
–What is it? Tell me.

1447
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,000
Jayanthi will be uncle's wife,
you'll be his 'spare'.

1448
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,040
Jayanthi will be uncle's wife,
you'll be his 'spare'.

1449
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,000
I know what a wife is.

1450
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,360
I know what a wife is.

1451
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,840
What is a 'spare'?

1452
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,000
I'll be his mistress.

1453
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,360
I'll be his mistress.

1454
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,680
Your uncle doesn't know that you've
started the fire long before him.

1455
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,040
Hey!

1456
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,000
Sister is coming!

1457
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,960
Sister is coming!

1458
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,960
Do you smoke?
–No.

1459
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,440
Liquor?
–No. Who told you?

1460
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,000
Who else?
Yours truly, your cousin.

1461
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,920
Who else?
Yours truly, your cousin.

1462
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,000
You're lying. You do.
You kept it a secret from me.

1463
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,000
I will only hide it from you
if it is true. I don't do it.

1464
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I will only hide it from you
if it is true. I don't do it.

1465
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,640
You do.
–No.

1466
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,000
There is.
–Yes, there is. So what now?

1467
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,560
There is.
–Yes, there is. So what now?

1468
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:10,760
Why did you hide it from me?
–Are you crazy?

1469
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,000
It is flat.
It is not getting heated at all.

1470
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,360
It is flat.
It is not getting heated at all.

1471
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:18,000
Fool!
–You were so close.

1472
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:18,320
Fool!
–You were so close.

1473
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:22,240
Now you are fighting.
–Here comes the arbitrator.

1474
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,000
She is asking for trouble.
–Did you guys fight?

1475
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,200
She is asking for trouble.
–Did you guys fight?

1476
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:30,000
Yes, we fought. She's your wife
and I'll be your mistress.

1477
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:30,520
Yes, we fought. She's your wife
and I'll be your mistress.

1478
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,720
What happened to you?
–Something happened.

1479
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,000
Answer my question. Yes or no?
–What's your problem?

1480
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,560
Answer my question. Yes or no?
–What's your problem?

1481
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,920
Hands off. You're the cause
of this problem.

1482
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,880
You!
–Useless!

1483
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
You're talking this way now.
What will you say after marriage?

1484
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,760
You're talking this way now.
What will you say after marriage?

1485
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,680
I'd rather not marry you.
Why should I suffer later?

1486
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:48,000
Don't marry me.
Are you the only girl in town?

1487
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,280
Don't marry me.
Are you the only girl in town?

1488
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,000
Get lost! There are many girls
waiting to marry me. Fool!

1489
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,160
Get lost! There are many girls
waiting to marry me. Fool!

1490
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,000
Why blow things out of proportion?
–How was that? It worked out.

1491
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,080
Why blow things out of proportion?
–How was that? It worked out.

1492
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,680
This is not enough.

1493
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,000
Do you feel bad?
She'll be back as fast as she goes.

1494
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,280
Do you feel bad?
She'll be back as fast as she goes.

1495
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,160
It doesn't matter
if she doesn't come back.

1496
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,560
Didn't I tell you?

1497
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,000
I swear I don't want you.

1498
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,920
I swear I don't want you.

1499
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,000
Kolanji, success!

1500
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,680
Kolanji, success!

1501
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,520
Kolanji, in our team.
–Our team.

1502
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,000
No, Kolanji will be in our team.
–No, he'll be in our team.

1503
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,240
No, Kolanji will be in our team.
–No, he'll be in our team.

1504
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,000
Kolanji will not play for you.
I'll tell who will play for him.

1505
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,560
Kolanji will not play for you.
I'll tell who will play for him.

1506
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,480
Touch one finger.

1507
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,000
Even if you had touched
this finger, Kolanji will play...

1508
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,640
Even if you had touched
this finger, Kolanji will play...

1509
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,600
...in his team.

1510
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:36,000
Hey!
–Adivangi, he is so afraid.

1511
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,240
Hey!
–Adivangi, he is so afraid.

1512
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,840
What is your problem?

1513
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,000
Did you hear anything?

1514
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,560
Did you hear anything?

1515
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,240
Just my luck.

1516
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,960
Go on, uncle.

1517
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:11,040
Why did you do this, Neelavenny?
–Get lost!

1518
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,000
Look over there!
–Uncle!

1519
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,520
Look over there!
–Uncle!

1520
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,880
Why are you sitting here
instead of going home?

1521
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Uncle is angry.
–I am very upset.

1522
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,120
Uncle is angry.
–I am very upset.

1523
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,880
Please be quiet.
–What's the matter?

1524
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:34,000
Your sister listened to others
and ditched me.

1525
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,000
What happened, uncle?
–Do you know what is...

1526
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,440
What happened, uncle?
–Do you know what is...

1527
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,360
...important for love?
–We are small boys,...

1528
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,000
...how would we know?
–A man buys a gift...

1529
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,600
...how would we know?
–A man buys a gift...

1530
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,000
...he loves for his lover,
that is important.

1531
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,280
...he loves for his lover,
that is important.

1532
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,000
Useless girl, she threw
that gift on my face.

1533
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:54,640
Useless girl, she threw
that gift on my face.

1534
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,120
Have we seen Shah Jahan and Mumtaz?
–No.

1535
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,000
But when we see Taj Mahal,
their love symbol,...

1536
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,880
But when we see Taj Mahal,
their love symbol,...

1537
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,440
...isn't it like seeing them?

1538
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,000
This is the same too.

1539
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,120
This is the same too.

1540
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:12,000
Uncle, this is boring.
Please end it!

1541
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,160
Uncle, this is boring.
Please end it!

1542
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,640
Uncle, get to the point.

1543
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,000
Fine, there's no us
or our love.

1544
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,200
Fine, there's no us
or our love.

1545
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,680
Then why are you holding
your love symbol in your hand?

1546
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,760
There is no love. Then why
do I need this love symbol?

1547
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,120
I've thrown her
just like I threw this bangle.

1548
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,520
Now I'm at peace.

1549
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:42,000
What am I to say,I cried because of you...

1550
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,560
What am I to say,I cried because of you...

1551
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,000
What else can I say...

1552
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,440
What else can I say...

1553
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,000
What am I to say,I cried because of you...

1554
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,960
What am I to say,I cried because of you...

1555
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,640
What else can I say...

1556
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,000
I don't know...

1557
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,360
I don't know...

1558
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:24,000
What am I to say,I cried because of you...

1559
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,480
What am I to say,I cried because of you...

1560
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,000
I could not sleepwhen I look at you...

1561
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,080
I could not sleepwhen I look at you...

1562
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,000
Now I will sleep...

1563
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,080
Now I will sleep...

1564
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,000
Even if I am alone...

1565
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,400
Even if I am alone...

1566
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:24,000
I will live with pride...

1567
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,360
I will live with pride...

1568
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:30,000
Because you are in my heart...

1569
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,320
Because you are in my heart...

1570
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:35,800
I thought of my parents...

1571
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,480
I could not remember anything...

1572
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:42,000
I tore everythingthat reminds me of you...

1573
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I tore everythingthat reminds me of you...

1574
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,000
But is this permanent...

1575
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,440
But is this permanent...

1576
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:06,000
What am I to say,I cried because of you...

1577
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,800
What am I to say,I cried because of you...

1578
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,000
What else can I say...

1579
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:12,920
What else can I say...

1580
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,640
I don't know...

1581
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,000
What am I to say,I cried because of you...

1582
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,760
What am I to say,I cried because of you...

1583
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,000
Hey! Lenin!
How are you?

1584
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,280
Hey! Lenin!
How are you?

1585
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:42,000
Why? I'm your mother.
–You left me.

1586
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,760
Why? I'm your mother.
–You left me.

1587
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,400
I only have my father.
I have no mother.

1588
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,000
Don't say you have no mother.
Your father hit me.

1589
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,080
Don't say you have no mother.
Your father hit me.

1590
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:54,000
That is why I left.
–Dad hit me too. Did I leave?

1591
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,320
That is why I left.
–Dad hit me too. Did I leave?

1592
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:57,920
When? Why did he hit you?
–That's our issue.

1593
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,000
I won't tell anyone.
–Fine, how is your hand?

1594
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,320
I won't tell anyone.
–Fine, how is your hand?

1595
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,520
Let it be.
I need money, give me the key.

1596
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:06,000
I won't tell you. It's our money.
We'll do anything with it.

1597
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,280
I won't tell you. It's our money.
We'll do anything with it.

1598
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:10,000
Fine, do anything with it.
Here you go.

1599
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,000
Tell dad
to keep proper accounts.

1600
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,680
Tell dad
to keep proper accounts.

1601
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,720
Why did you come here? Go away!
–Keep quiet. Can't you keep quiet?

1602
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,000
Why talk to him?
–He is my son.

1603
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,760
Why talk to him?
–He is my son.

1604
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,400
I'm your son. If he is
your son too, I'm not your son.

1605
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,000
Keep quiet.
You're such a pain.

1606
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,680
Keep quiet.
You're such a pain.

1607
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,680
Lenin, take the key back, okay?

1608
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,000
It doesn't want to come off?

1609
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,800
It doesn't want to come off?

1610
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,800
Mom, I came with you
because dad hit me all the time.

1611
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,960
If you hit me too,
where will I go?

1612
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:34,920
Yes, when he did that,
mom smacked him.

1613
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,000
Even you have not
hit him that way.

1614
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,240
Even you have not
hit him that way.

1615
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,000
No need to pray or have rituals,no need for garlands...

1616
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,280
No need to pray or have rituals,no need for garlands...

1617
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,040
...or mantras,just tie this thali on me.

1618
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:48,000
This thali is a symbolthat says you are my slave.

1619
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,560
This thali is a symbolthat says you are my slave.

1620
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,960
A thread need not determineour relationship, Pushpam.

1621
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:57,720
The day you understand this,you can remove it.

1622
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:30,000
Forget it,
every parent would hit their kid.

1623
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,680
Forget it,
every parent would hit their kid.

1624
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,440
Don't feel bad.

1625
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,720
My mom has never hit me before.

1626
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,000
Only my father hated me
all along.

1627
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,680
Only my father hated me
all along.

1628
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,480
Now my mother hates me too.

1629
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,640
I feel like everyone
hates me now.

1630
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:58,560
Maybe I'm wrong
like what my father says.

1631
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,000
Don't worry, friend.
It doesn't matter who is with you.

1632
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,320
Don't worry, friend.
It doesn't matter who is with you.

1633
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:04,240
I'll be with you till the end.

1634
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,840
Dad, mom is asking
if I have eaten.

1635
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,000
Tell her you have eaten.
–I ate, mom.

1636
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,040
Tell her you have eaten.
–I ate, mom.

1637
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:36,000
Dad, mom is asking
if you have eaten.

1638
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:36,760
Dad, mom is asking
if you have eaten.

1639
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,160
Tell her I've eaten.
–He has eaten.

1640
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,000
Ask mom if she has eaten.
–Have you eaten?

1641
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,400
Ask mom if she has eaten.
–Have you eaten?

1642
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,000
Dad, I waved goodbye to mom.
–Okay.

1643
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,680
Dad, I waved goodbye to mom.
–Okay.

1644
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,360
Dad, can you buy
new clothes for me?

1645
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,000
You can have anything you want.
What do you want?

1646
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
You can have anything you want.
What do you want?

1647
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:11,960
Dad, can I buy this one?
–That's nice, you can have it.

1648
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,720
Can you keep quiet?
Get me some of that.

1649
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,000
Give him some.

1650
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:18,200
Give him some.

1651
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:54,000
Kolanji, why did you stop?
–No, drop me here, I'm scared, dad.

1652
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,120
Kolanji, why did you stop?
–No, drop me here, I'm scared, dad.

1653
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,040
Mate, come on, let's go.

1654
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:42,000
Poongoodi, Gemini is my cousin.
I only joked with him.

1655
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:42,080
Poongoodi, Gemini is my cousin.
I only joked with him.

1656
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,000
I used to pull his leg
and tease him.

1657
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:48,000
But I swear,
there is nothing between us.

1658
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:48,040
But I swear,
there is nothing between us.

1659
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:52,080
I know that he has been thinking
about you right from small.

1660
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,000
He can't live without you.

1661
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:54,680
He can't live without you.

1662
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,760
Likewise, you can't live
without him.

1663
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:00,000
Don't think too much,
just talk to him.

1664
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,960
Don't think too much,
just talk to him.

1665
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,480
Only evil will come after us.

1666
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,000
We have to seek
the good things in life.

1667
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,120
We have to seek
the good things in life.

1668
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,840
Stone.
–Fine, just play.

1669
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:35,560
Run!

1670
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,320
He didn't catch, run!

1671
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,000
Why are you playing
with the kids from that street?

1672
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:42,360
Why are you playing
with the kids from that street?

1673
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,960
Why do you bother?
–Can't you play with us?

1674
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,000
Yes, Adivangi, it's a sin to see
you and a curse to mix with you.

1675
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,400
Yes, Adivangi, it's a sin to see
you and a curse to mix with you.

1676
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,760
My dad said we'll know
only through experience.

1677
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,000
That's not true.
God created all of us equal.

1678
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,120
That's not true.
God created all of us equal.

1679
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,680
Therefore, we must stay
together and united.

1680
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:00,000
My dad said we are one.

1681
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
My dad said we are one.

1682
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,800
Are you answering me back?

1683
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,480
Kolanji, this has nothing
to do with you.

1684
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,000
When a man hits another,
another man only needs...

1685
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:36,520
When a man hits another,
another man only needs...

1686
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:41,160
...to be human to stop the cruelty.
You don't need any other reason.

1687
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,000
My father taught me this.

1688
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,880
My father taught me this.

1689
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,760
Adivangi, what shall
we do to him?

1690
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:48,000
Let him go, he's a little boy.
If we stoop down to his level,...

1691
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,760
Let him go, he's a little boy.
If we stoop down to his level,...

1692
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:54,000
...there is no difference
between us.

1693
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,200
...there is no difference
between us.

1694
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,000
If I don't listen to my friend,
it will reflect badly...

1695
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,000
...on our friendship, right?

1696
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,800
...on our friendship, right?

1697
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,000
So, you want to leave him?

1698
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,000
Okay, let's go then.

1699
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:06,600
Okay, let's go then.

1700
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,360
But if I let someone
who thrashed my friend,...

1701
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,000
...won't it reflect badly
on our friendship?

1702
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:18,960
...won't it reflect badly
on our friendship?

1703
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:23,040
I don't think so.
–So what should we do?

1704
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:24,000
Thrash the person.
–Let's do it.

1705
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,680
Thrash the person.
–Let's do it.

1706
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,840
Kolanji, don't.

1707
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,000
All of you,
move to Kolanji's side.

1708
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:36,440
All of you,
move to Kolanji's side.

1709
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,000
Punch his mouth.

1710
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,480
Punch his mouth.

1711
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,880
Why?
–It'll hurt him...

1712
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
...just like it did to me.

1713
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,720
...just like it did to me.

1714
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,680
Learn from him.

1715
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,400
Let's go.

1716
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:09,400
I'm letting you go because
of my friend, or I will smack you.

1717
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,640
See, he brought the villain
just like he said he would.

1718
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:46,400
I won't let you go
no matter where you go.

1719
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:58,280
Hey, I'll kill you today.

1720
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,000
Hey, what is your problem?

1721
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,840
Hey, what is your problem?

1722
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,680
Why are you chasing my son?
–He's saying you're not his father.

1723
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,000
You are claiming
that he is your son.

1724
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:54,680
You are claiming
that he is your son.

1725
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,840
Let him say whatever he wants,
he is my blood.

1726
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:06,000
I don't care, I'm going to knock
the daylights out of you today.

1727
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,040
Don't touch him,
hands off him. Hey!

1728
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,560
How dare you touch my son!

1729
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:16,040
Kolanji, get up!
What happened?

1730
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,760
Hey, get lost!

1731
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,000
Come on!

1732
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,840
Come on!

1733
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,280
You!

1734
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:53,680
Go!

1735
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:00,000
What is our problem?
Why are you like this?

1736
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:00,440
What is our problem?
Why are you like this?

1737
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,880
Step aside!

1738
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,000
Mom!
–You are not my son! Get lost!

1739
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:18,880
Mom!
–You are not my son! Get lost!

1740
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:36,000
Where is Kolanji?
–He doesn't know how to face you.

1741
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,560
Where is Kolanji?
–He doesn't know how to face you.

1742
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,280
He feels guilty that
he is the cause of everything.

1743
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,840
I saw him
at the outskirts this morning.

1744
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,600
I don't know where he is now.

1745
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,600
I know where he is.

1746
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,840
When I was in Year One,
I went into the forest...

1747
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,000
...and sat by the lake.

1748
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:30,880
...and sat by the lake.

1749
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:35,360
The kids
were playing in the water.

1750
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,120
I was afraid of water.

1751
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,000
My father had his loincloth on,
he was filling his field...

1752
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,440
My father had his loincloth on,
he was filling his field...

1753
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:47,800
...with water.
When he saw me sitting in fear,...

1754
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:48,000
...he walked towards me
and kicked me into the lake.

1755
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,360
...he walked towards me
and kicked me into the lake.

1756
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:59,680
When I fell into the lake,
I kicked and drank lots of water.

1757
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:00,000
Somehow I came up.

1758
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,760
Somehow I came up.

1759
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:06,000
From that second onwards,
I had no fear for water.

1760
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,480
From that second onwards,
I had no fear for water.

1761
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:09,560
But I was afraid of my father.

1762
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:12,000
I thought he was going to kill me,
I didn't even talk to him.

1763
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,560
I thought he was going to kill me,
I didn't even talk to him.

1764
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,000
I slowly moved away from him.

1765
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:18,760
I slowly moved away from him.

1766
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,000
A year later,
he died of jaundice.

1767
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,040
A year later,
he died of jaundice.

1768
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:30,000
Thereafter, whenever
I went for a swim,...

1769
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,960
Thereafter, whenever
I went for a swim,...

1770
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:35,000
...I only thought of my father.

1771
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:36,000
I tear up
when I'm in the water.

1772
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,680
I tear up
when I'm in the water.

1773
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:42,000
My father did not try to kill me.
He taught me about life.

1774
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,600
My father did not try to kill me.
He taught me about life.

1775
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:46,280
I found this out too late.

1776
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:48,000
But when I realised this,
my father wasn't around.

1777
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,440
But when I realised this,
my father wasn't around.

1778
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I didn't understand his love,
I didn't talk to him,...

1779
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,640
I didn't understand his love,
I didn't talk to him,...

1780
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:58,440
...until now I feel guilty.

1781
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:05,160
But I am angry with him.
I was a little boy.

1782
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:06,000
He could have sat beside me
and told me, "Son, I did not...

1783
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,280
He could have sat beside me
and told me, "Son, I did not...

1784
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,880
...try to kill you. I pushed
you into the water so that...

1785
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
...you would learn to swim.
You are my blood,...

1786
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,840
...you would learn to swim.
You are my blood,...

1787
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:17,520
...my life.
I love you very much".

1788
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:18,000
If he had told me that,
I would not feel guilty now.

1789
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,440
If he had told me that,
I would not feel guilty now.

1790
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:29,200
I just realised that I'm doing
the same mistake my father did.

1791
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:34,720
Kolanji,...

1792
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:36,000
...it was wrong
to scold and hit you.

1793
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,280
...it was wrong
to scold and hit you.

1794
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:42,000
There is a way
to make people understand.

1795
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,400
There is a way
to make people understand.

1796
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:48,000
We can't use force or threat
to get messages across.

1797
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,120
We can't use force or threat
to get messages across.

1798
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:54,000
I scolded and hit you
so that you'll turn out fine.

1799
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,160
I scolded and hit you
so that you'll turn out fine.

1800
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:00,000
You are my life, my blood.

1801
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,600
You are my life, my blood.

1802
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:04,520
I like you very much.

1803
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:12,000
No, it was my mistake.
Please forgive me.

1804
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:12,160
No, it was my mistake.
Please forgive me.

1805
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:16,120
How can you be responsible
for a silly old fool's mistake?

1806
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,720
You are much smarter
than I was at your age.

1807
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,000
You'll turn out fine, I know.

1808
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,080
You'll turn out fine, I know.

1809
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,000
Can I tell you a truth?

1810
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:36,920
Can I tell you a truth?

1811
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:40,840
I was naughtier
than you when I was young.

1812
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:44,640
My mom used to spank me
on my bottom.

1813
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:47,080
I used to walk around
with a torn pant.

1814
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:48,000
People used to call
that hole a postal box.

1815
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,800
People used to call
that hole a postal box.

1816
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,000
They dropped paper into it.

1817
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,840
They dropped paper into it.

1818
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:09,520
Can I call you father?
