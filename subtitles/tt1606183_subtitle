1
00:03:45,925 --> 00:04:03,435


3
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,108
...his name is Baskaran.

4
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,147
Everyone call him as Boss.

5
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,344
Who is running after?
What had really happened?

6
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,287
Few months earlier...

7
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:30,460
The city of temples and ponds,
Kumbakonam is Boss'native place.

8
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,830
He's Saravanan,
Boss' elder brother.

9
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,670
Don't imagine he's some terrorizing
villain travelling on Bullet.

10
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,745
He's very soft type like
hero Murali of film 'ldhayam'.

11
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,973
He's a Veterinary doctor
in Thanjavur.

12
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:48,347
His only problem is though nearing
middle age, he's still a bachelor.

13
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,784
Greetings brother. How are you?
- l'm fine.

14
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,426
Cow has delivered a calf, l've brought
sweet made from biesting milk.

15
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,151
- Take it.
- Very good.

16
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,488
lt's all your lucky hand.

17
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,029
There's nothing in my hand,
it's all God's grace.

18
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,224
Watch out, l'll oversee
the next delivery too.

19
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:07,395
You're helping cattle but
you still remain a bachelor.

20
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,073
- Take it.
- Brother.

21
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,472
Did l ask you?

22
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,114
What bothers you if
l'm married or not?

23
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,410
There are many in the city
unmarried, go and ask them.

24
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,744
He gets furious if anyone talks
about his marriage.

25
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,219
Her name is Nithya.
Boss'younger sister.

26
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:31,420
Studying B.A. Economics final year.
She wants to become a TVcompere.

27
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,657
Look at her, how she shake
her head while talking.

28
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,132
l feel Ajith must act in Hollywood films,
what's your opinion?

29
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,600
Yes, definitely.

30
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,639
lndeed, because he has
the right personality.

31
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,367
She's Sivagami.
Boss'mother.

32
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,376
Baskaran has no father,
his mother is everything to him.

33
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,811
Her most important duty
for the family is...

34
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,282
Pray to God...pray to God...
pray to god!

35
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,056
He has named his saloon smartly
as 'Thala and Thalapathy'.

36
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,457
He's our Boss' only friend.
His name is Nallathambi.

37
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,832
Change the blade.

38
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,895
Lord Ganesha! Whether crops
grow or not when it rains,

39
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,073
every one must grow long hair.

40
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,208
l must cut and earn well.

41
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,107
lf TR decides to shave his beard,
l must give him the shave.

42
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,475
Give me knife!

43
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,414
Like Vadivelu had a story in inheriting
the bakery shop in film 'Giri',

44
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,249
Nallathambi too has a story
behind getting this saloon shop.

45
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,127
Groom ran away from marriage after
knowing my daughter is pregnant.

46
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,388
Would he stay back to
deliver the child?

47
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,259
Let him go to hell, useless man.

48
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:44,095
You were the only one with
a smiling face in the marriage hall.

49
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:54,240


50
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:55,504
For that?

51
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,239
You must give a new life
to my daughter.

52
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,180
Go man...go...

53
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,787
Are you trying to register a second hand bike
used by someone else to me?

54
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,513
Go man!

55
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:11,220
Wait...if you marry my daughter,
l'll give my saloon to you.

56
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,365
- Saloon?
- What do you say now?

57
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,463
He liked the deal very much.

58
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,474
Play the band!

59
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,572
To say about Boss in two lines
like Thirukural,

60
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:33,480
he's busy all the 24 hours,
but he'll not do anything.

61
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:47,992
Boss!

62
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,902
Boss...boss...ask my name, boss...

63
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,872
Boss...boss...my name is Boss...

64
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,911
Boss...boss...ask my name, boss...

65
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:05,880
Boss...boss...my name is Boss...

66
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,181
Unemployed but always busy...

67
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,859
When we play cricket, temple tower
is the boundary line...

68
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,795
Nobody every asked me if
l'm a good man or a bad man...

69
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,934
Boss...boss...ask my name, boss...

70
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:30,700
Boss...boss...my name is Boss...

71
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:53,725


72
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,796
We'll wake up early morning
at 5 am...

73
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,736
Jump into river Cauvery
from the rock...

74
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,449
From 8 to 10 am, we'll hang out
in bus stop with a smile on face...

75
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,283
Spend the afternoon in the saloon...

76
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:22,257
Eat on loan from the
push cart food seller...

77
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:26,090
Tea shop bench is our office...

78
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,962
Boss...boss...ask my name, boss...

79
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:34,606
Boss...boss...my name is Boss...

80
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:57,290


81
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,690
Gossip about the town
from 2 to 3 pm...

82
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,802
We'll criticize Obama
from here only...

83
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,616
From 4 to 5 pm,
we'll hang out in college...

84
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,254
We act like good boys...

85
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,323
We'll regroup again in
theatre at 6 pm...

86
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,052
After the film, we go on hunt
for a quarter bottle...

87
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:34,028
Boss...boss...ask my name, boss...

88
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,999
Boss...boss...my name is Boss...

89
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:42,038
Boss...boss...ask my name, boss...

90
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,075
Boss...boss...my name is Boss...

91
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:50,078
Unemployed but always busy...

92
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:54,082
When we play cricket, temple tower
is the boundary line...

93
00:10:54,286 --> 00:11:02,022
Nobody every asked me if
l'm a good man or a bad man...

94
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:06,062
Boss...boss...ask my name, boss...

95
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:10,929
Boss...boss...my name is Boss...

96
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:23,207
Boss!

97
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:38,354


98
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,956
ls she here only?

99
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,362
Saw her face early morning,
l'm finished.

100
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,298
Father, you must save me.

101
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,798
Hey VlP! Exam?

102
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,010
lf you fail in your English exam
this year also,

103
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,305
it'll be super, we both can write
the exam together next year.

104
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,344
She has started it.

105
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,643
Please, fail this year too...
please...

106
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,285
l'll not get tensed for this.

107
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,981
This time l'll definitely pass.
l'm terribly hungry.

108
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,991
- Mother, let's have breakfast.
- Wait son. l'll come.

109
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,999
Copy or do something
to pass this year.

110
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,569
Unable to show my face in public.

111
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,329
Losing honour.

112
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,997
lt's already gone.
Confirmed, it's gone.

113
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,937
Yes...yes...it's going every year.

114
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,247
Anyway please check
and give me a call.

115
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,347
Okay...okay...

116
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:32,846
Brother...

117
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,146
lt's not big deal to take
bits to exam,

118
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,486
you must pass exam by
copying those bits.

119
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,719
Okay, l'll drop you.

120
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,397
l haven't eaten anything.

121
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,797
- No use in writing exam, useless.
- Mother, bye.

122
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,131
You'll feel sleepy if you eat and go,
drink this and go on.

123
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:59,800
- Mother, please have this too.
- You're right.

124
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,708
Have lunch after the exam.
Taunting me?

125
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,480
l'll pass and then take on you.

126
00:13:06,485 --> 00:14:08,573


127
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:11,442
Okay.

128
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,240
Bangles are reciting poems...

129
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,886
Cool gentle chill breeze
is blowing across...

130
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:54,925
My heart is pounding and
my body is thrilled...

131
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,492
- Young maiden...
- Brother!

132
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:01,265
Why are you standing there?
Empty seat is there, sit.

133
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,502
What a lousy life!

134
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:39,633


135
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,034
My bit! Where has it fallen?

136
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,635
My life is in it.
Please find it for me.

137
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,541
Don't know where is it?

138
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,314
God! Find it for me.

139
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,210
Excuse me!

140
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,322
- ls it yours?
- Yes...yes...give it to me.

141
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,885
Thank you very much.
You've given me a new life.

142
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,219
lf l had lost it...
l shudder to think.

143
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,390
Did you read it?

144
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,597
What's there to hide from you?

145
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,067
l'm going to write arrear paper,
l'm taking 36 bits.

146
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,739
Nobody can find it.

147
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,238
3 bits are inside my brief.

148
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:22,412
This main bit has all the
information about other bits.

149
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,846
Forget all that, what do you do?

150
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,015
Thought of flattering her,
but they never give us any chance.

151
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,557
l'm going to write arrear exam,
best of luck...

152
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:37,694
Pardon?

153
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,765
Pardon?!

154
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,769
Passengers to Arts college get down.

155
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:58,341


156
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,183
Why are you following her
like the Hutch dog?

157
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,220
Buddy! lf you had told,
wouldn't l've come to drop you?

158
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,254
l'm going to write arrear exam,

159
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,358
if l go with you,
it's proving unlucky to me,

160
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,221
l'm failing every time.

161
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,223
Buddy! You're unlucky to me.
Leave me.

162
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,893
Buddy! You wouldn't mind
if l tell you something, right?

163
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,904
Even if Goddess of Learning herself
drops you, you'll not pass.

164
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:23,665
Making fun of me?

165
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,672
What else then?

166
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,641
lnstead of copying, why are you
bothered about astrology?

167
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,710
Go man!

168
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,142
l can't leave you so easily.

169
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,079
This time you'll fail again,
you didn't drop me this time,

170
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,115
that's why l failed,

171
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,310
if not l would've topped the state
and won gold medal,

172
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,750
you may say all this.

173
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,951
l'll not give you an opportunity
to say all this.

174
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,059
Come...come...come l say...

175
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,094
So, you don't want me to pass and
become Collector of Kumbakonam.

176
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,321
Okay, go.

177
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,167
Enough, come.

178
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,699
lnstead of taking bits to exam,
if you'd taken blouse bits and sold them,

179
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,536
you'd have opened a shop
like Naidu Hall.

180
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,575
How do you fail in exam
inspite of taking bits?

181
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:06,513
Buddy, l get confused every time
where l've kept which bit.

182
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:12,520
This time l've a special bit with
information about other bits.

183
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,518
How is it?

184
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,919
Practice make a man perfect!

185
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,291
What did you say buddy?

186
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:25,162
Practice make a man perfect,
so said Swami Vivekananda.

187
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,806
No external force can fail you
in this exam, buddy!

188
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,031
Boss!

189
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,913
How are you, Boss?
lt's 6 months we've met.

190
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,810
We met in the last arrear exam.

191
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,143
Looks like you've put on weight.

192
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,910
Look, how much weight l've lost!

193
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,145
Diabetes?

194
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,380
No, full diet control.

195
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,591
l'll lose more weight
by next arrear exam.

196
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,353
You must also lose some weight,
because we are getting old, right?

197
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,587
Who is he? Your uncle?

198
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,663
Who is he? Your crony?

199
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,158
lt seems he has taunted me!

200
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,371
Just for fun, don't get angry.

201
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,837
l'm Venkat, Boss' arrear friend.

202
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,205
Friend?

203
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,210
Oh God! He looks like
a pumpkin with a tie.

204
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,312
Nice meet you.

205
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:14,111
l've so much to talk to you,
come Boss.

206
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,016
lf l knew l would be meeting such
a man, l wouldn't have come.

207
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,289
Forget about the exam, Boss.
Leave it.

208
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,289
- An important news.
- What?

209
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,793
- l've released a new edition.
- New release?

210
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,898
Four months. lt's a boy.

211
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,263
Look there.
Have a whale of time.

212
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,871
He's boasting as if he has
released 100 billion Avatar.

213
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,098
Leave it buddy,
would everyone get it free like him?

214
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,435
Boss...what are you telling him?

215
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,204
He has twins, come let's meet
your new release.

216
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:41,970
Come.

217
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,046
lt's vacation for kids.

218
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,616
They were torturing me to
take them out on picnic.

219
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:51,184
Writing arrear exam is
like picnic, right?

220
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,381
That's why l've brought them here.

221
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,685
- Are you married?
- No buddy.

222
00:19:55,894 --> 00:20:00,957
Next time you must come to write
arrear exam with your wife.

223
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,794
One must marry at right age.

224
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,865
You're writing arrears form Gandhi's time,
don't talk about age.

225
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:07,970
l'll slap you.

226
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:08,969
Have milk.

227
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,165
- How are you?
- l'm fine.

228
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,071
- Will he pass atleast this year?
- Definitely.

229
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,142
All the best.

230
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,038
- What's that?
- Milk.

231
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,307
- Last night you would've had it.
- l slept off.

232
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,550
Old man, poor man dozed off.
Friendship!

233
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:22,981
What's our next plan?

234
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,587
Family planning for you.

235
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,157
l didn't ask you,
what's our next plan, Boss?

236
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:35,464
Why are you building up like scientists
who sent rocket to moon?

237
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,862
Both are dullards who have
come to write arrear exams.

238
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,504
Bell is ringing, go else they'll
make you kneel down, Go!

239
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,666
Go and fix a machine.

240
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,807
- From now we are not friends.
- Why?

241
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,243
He's like elder son of Adam and Eve,

242
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,971
if he's your friend,
who am l?

243
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:55,449
You've brushed it aside so easily,
it's 5 year old friendship.

244
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,721
Friendship from heart is friendship
not that's on face value.

245
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,189
ls your friendship an
example of that Kural?

246
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:09,625
God! Give me strength to bear
any number of arrears.

247
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:19,207
Boss! Why are you keeping bits?

248
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,309
Get lost!

249
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,078
Don't pass the exam,
l'll be left alone.

250
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,812
- Shut up.
- God! Fail him.

251
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,784
Hi! Super!

252
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,663
Bit!
Caught!

253
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,735
Escape!

254
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,010
What am l to do now?

255
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:08,921
Pass it.

256
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,460
- Pass it.
- l'll try, madam.

257
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,032
- l told you to pass this.
- Paper?

258
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,202
Take it.

259
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,104
Oh! my bit!

260
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,170
Front pocket, sleeve neck,
left side shoulder, right side shoulder,

261
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,711
pant pocket, brief...

262
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,207
Take out all the bits.

263
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:55,797
31 , 32, 33...three are missing.

264
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,141
- lt'll take some time, is it okay?
- No problem.

265
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,385
Leave the bits in brief,
l'll manage with it.

266
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,750
- Okay, sit down.
- l want water.

267
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,257
Go.

268
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:46,791


269
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,854
Madam, he's copying from
the text book.

270
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:57,067
What's this madam? You're not
allowing to copy from bit or book,

271
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,236
what do you think of yourself?

272
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,496
How can l pass the exam?
Get a degree, join a job,

273
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,605
marry and have kids.

274
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:03,536
Pardon?

275
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,032
Pardon!

276
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,904
Always repeats the same word.

277
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,076
What think you?

278
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,009
ldiot...stupid...nonsense.

279
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,147
You country fruit.

280
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,645
Degree no...marriage no,
children no, matter no.

281
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,318
l complaint principal,
name tell...tell name...tell...tell.

282
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:18,648
Come on...come on...

283
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:19,721
Pardon!

284
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:39,802


285
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,706
Got caught while copying in exam by a girl
and you've come out shamelessly.

286
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,079
Why are you watching the song
as if you've passed lAS?

287
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,915
lt's routine in public life, buddy.
Can't take it seriously.

288
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,585
Jealousy man.

289
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,800
He must in hospital at this time.

290
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,701
Why is he roaming on road like me?

291
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:26,182


292
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,722
l'm Saravanan,
Veterinary doctor in Thanjavur,

293
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,997
- Nandhini...?
- Yes, it's me.

294
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,666
Star Sadhayam, Capricorn sign,

295
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,234
height 5.4 ft, weight 60 kgs,
BA degree.

296
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,464
How do you know all these details?
l don't know who you are?

297
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,370
l know your horoscope.

298
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,238
Because it's with me.

299
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:53,647
My mother would've seen
around 20 or 30 girls till now,

300
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,911
l never went after any girl like this,

301
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:01,149
l've been following you stealthily
for over a month.

302
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,955
l wanted to talk to you but
couldn't muster courage.

303
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:10,658
Today l decided to talk to you,
l've done it.

304
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,963
Tell me, what's the matter?

305
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,641
You haven't yet taken
any decision, right?

306
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:22,004
- Whatever it is, talk to my father.
- Okay.

307
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:32,682
We've met for the fist time in temple,
watch out, it will end well.

308
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:49,035


309
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,030
Excuse me.

310
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,872
You said you're in Trichy, what are you
doing in a deserted temple?

311
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,640
What are you doing here?

312
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,348
You were roaming on roads,
have you changed it to temples?

313
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,715
- Why don't you do something good?
- Don't get tensed, Saravana.

314
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,048
What's her name?

315
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,719
Feeling shy too!

316
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,122
You're so old,
still loving from one side.

317
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,494
- Mother knows about this?
- No, mother doesn't know this.

318
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,066
You must talk to mother about this.

319
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,334
What's this?

320
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,971
- Her horoscope and photo.
- Bloody crook.

321
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,937
Still roaming like a school boy,
she's coming.

322
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,577
You've gone too far,
must settle it immediately.

323
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,472
Saravanan is the eldest son.

324
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,014
Since he's the groom,
we are here to discuss.

325
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:33,707
Talk to them.

326
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:39,015
Yes, broker told about you,
your family and about her.

327
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,316
He said horoscopes too
matched perfectly,

328
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,754
- isn't it mother?
- Yes.

329
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,292
lt's okay from our side.

330
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,054
- What about the other things?
- Yes...

331
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,562
l don't want anything as dowry.

332
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,258
My both sons are earning very well.

333
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:56,973
Fix an auspicious day and time
for engagement and marriage.

334
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,802
- He told me everything on phone.
- ls it?

335
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,705
You haven't taken the juice.

336
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,345
We are getting late,
shall we go, mother?

337
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,014
Please have little juice for my sake.

338
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,206
He's insisting so much,
please have it son.

339
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,111
What are you doing?

340
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,011
Be Careful son.
Did l ask anything wrong.

341
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:15,488
lf anyone asks questions while
eating, he gets choked.

342
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,127
- Be careful son.
- Okay...okay.

343
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,454
Please have it.

344
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,295
Tell me now, what do you do?

345
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,296
Looks like he'll not leave me.

Didn't l tell you?
Look how fast he is!

357
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,809
Have you understood

358
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,104
Wait a minute.

359
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,111
Hello Nandhini?

360
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,342
Saravana! Has the bull delivered the calf?

361
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:18,181
Hello..hello...Nandhini...
Hello...who is it?

362
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,687
Who are you?
Will you tell me or not?

363
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,190
Wait, talk to the calf.

364
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,090
- Talk to him.
- What? Me?

365
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,195

367
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:32,360
Any problem?

368
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,297
Sorry, you carry on.

369
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,736
Did you talk to her?

370
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,072
Brother wanted to talk to her,
so l gave him a call.

371
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,375
l saw her face just before tying the knot.
Keep quiet....always making fun.

372
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,781
Now the technology is improved
so much, you see...

373
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:50,886
What do you say?

374
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,824

Tell me buddy!
Hello...hello...

He's always busy.

381
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,166
l still can't believe it.

382
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,735
Everything went off easily
and quickly.

383
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,814
You like me, right?

384
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,507
Will you call immediately if
anyone gives a missed call?

385
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,084
l must control your phone bill
first after marriage.

386
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,251
lt means you like me, right?

387
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,191
Sorry sir, my close friend.
Class mate in school.

388
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,296

389
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,522
Dubai?

390
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,333
l'm asking you and
you haven't yet answered it.

391
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,766
What exactly do you do?
Come on tell me.

392
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,065
Finished degree,
waiting for the passport.

393
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:44,400
l'll go to foreign immediately
on getting it.

394
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,010
By the by, where did you
do your degree?

00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,109
Trichy to Tanjore?

396
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:51,282
lf we stay few more minutes,
he'll ask questions and embarrass us.

397
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,710
Shall we go, mother?

398
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,043
We'll take leave sir.

You were fine, right?

Come dear, you've come at right time.

00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:14,738
- Enough..stop it.
- Have some water.

408
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,739
How long will you act like coughing?
Enough!

He's groom's younger brother.

413
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,850
- His name is Baskaran.
- Hi!

414
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,354
l feel like l've met you before.

415
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,523
- What is he doing, father?
- He has finished degree.

416
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,856
Waiting for the passport.

417

As soon as he gets,
he'll fly to foreign.

418
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,835
Am l right?

419
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,770

424
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,618
- One more important thing...

425
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,114
Come mother.

426
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,452
- We are going to temple, right?
- You go, l'm leaving.

427
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,630
Have you inquired properly?
ls the groom really a veterinary doctor?

428
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,128
Why did you get this doubt?
Would l not inquire properly?

429
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:19,463
Groom is veterinary doctor in Thanjavur,
salary is Rs.25000 a month,

430
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,129
very responsible man,

431
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,404
Okay...okay...

432
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,374
l've inquired about him also.
His name is Baskaran.

433
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,980
Didn't even finish degree.
He's a wastrel without any job.

434
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,414
He spends most of the time
in a saloon.

435
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,648
lrresponsible man.
ln one word, he's useless.

436
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:41,756
Key!

437
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,226
Bike key.

438
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,156
Get him the key.

439
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:02,840
Hello!

440
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:51,388


441
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:55,726
l asked earlier, who is this girl?

442
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:59,892
Later l realised she's my better half...

443
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:04,234
She's looking at me and
asking something...

444
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:08,401
She's seen everywhere...

445
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,910
Smiles with her eyes...
Walks before me...

446
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:17,076
Tearing away my heart...

447
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:22,021
Though in a crowd,
she's distinctively separate...

448
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:30,656
She's a walking flower...
She has done something with me...

449
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:35,032
l asked earlier, who is this girl?

450
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,608
Later l realised she's my better half...

451
00:34:40,778 --> 00:35:13,807


452
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,709
When l look at her,
she looks elsewhere...

453
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,977
When l don't see her,
she stares at me...

454
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:27,487
She smiles at me but refuses
when l see her...

455
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,822
She acts truly false...

456
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:40,596
Nobody has ever understood the heart
of a woman which is a puzzle...

457
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:49,338
Women never care about
the love of men...

458
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:53,677
She'll acknowledge after
heart is broken...

459
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:57,616
She'll offer an umbrella after
the rain stops...

460
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:02,418
She has done something with me...

461
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:06,688
l asked earlier, who is this girl?

462
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:11,096
Later l realised she's my better half...

463
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:27,843


464
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:37,216
l'll ask her when will put such lovely
motifs in my courtyard...

465
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:45,993
l'll see the dawn of new day with
her pranks in my home...

466
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:54,735
l wish to be born as
her glass bangles...

467
00:36:54,946 --> 00:37:03,581
l wish she wears my heart too
in her anklets...

468
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:08,088
l wish to be her ear rings...

469
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:11,750
l wish to die caressing her
lovely cheeks...

470
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:16,593
She has done something with me...

471
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:21,033
l asked earlier, who is this girl?

472
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,437
Later l realised she's my better half...

473
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:49,961


474
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:53,128
Be careful.

475
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,465
Cot is very strong.
ls it part of dowry?

476
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,266
Would that Mongoose head buy it?

477
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,205
- What are you doing here?
- My brother's first night.

478
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,209
Your brother's first night,
but what are you doing here?

479
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,075
l'm decorating the room.

480
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:10,219
This is done by flower seller.
New film has released, let's watch it.

481
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,752
- No money in pocket, buddy.
- ls it in bureau then?

482
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,652
Say don't have money,
why add pocket?

483
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,729
Anyway l but the tickets everytime.
l'll wait downstairs, come quickly.

484
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:25,493
Come with some side dish.
- What are you doing here?

485
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:26,499
To tighten the screws of cot.

486
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,729
She's Chandrika,
my sister-in-law's sister.

487
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,173
He's Nallathambi, VlP's best friend.

488
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,070
- Hi!
- Greetings.

489
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:34,340
Okay.

490
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:40,015
Buddy! Tell your wife and
kids to eat quickly.

491
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,447
Elder son has to go to school
tomorrow, you may get late.

492
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,355
Just shaking hands only.

493
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,319
Okay...okay...

494
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,619
Though very friendly, when it comes
to girls, take no chances.

495
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,089
Nallathambi runs a saloon
in this area,

496
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,529
you'll laugh if you know the name,
it's 'Thala Thalapathy' saloon.

497
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:58,793
'Thala Thalapathy' ?

498
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,362
What's that VlP?

499
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,200
Don't you know what is VlP?

500
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,043
Unemployed...scou...person.

501
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,472
So, he's doing all this.

502
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,771
How would she know how difficult
it is to be doing nothing?

503
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,471
ls everything going on fine?

504
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,014
lf you do this decoration properly,

505
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,710
decoration of all marriages
in the family is yours.

506
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:18,718
l'll slap you.

507
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,817
What are you trying to do?

508
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,796
How long do l've
to manage like this?

509
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:39,537


510
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,237
That too looking at me!

511
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,140
She's teasing me!

512
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,816
Battery is low, say it quickly
else it'll switch off.

513
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,651
Hey Thala Thalapathy!

514
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,324
Greetings brother.

515
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,095
He called me not you.

516
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:04,926
l'm coming brother.

517
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,325
Where are you going?

518
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,137
How will it succeed if you
ask me like that?

519
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,242
We are leaders of the town,
we'll discuss about election coalition.

520
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,605
l'm telling you, keep it in your mind,

521
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,441
come two steps behind me
while l'm in public.

522
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:19,274
Why?

523
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,451
Because l'm library and
you're paper.

524
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,920
Buy two tickets,
l'll talk to him and come.

525
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,853
Boss! Work like fire.

526
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,620
Greetings brother.
Are you fine?

527
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,730
ls the skin head here to buy theatre
instead of collecting loan due?

528
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,456
- Greetings brother.
- How are you doing?

529
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,793
- l'm fine.
- How is your business going on?

530
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:38,798
Going on, brother.

531
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,527
You're not coming for any loan.

532
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,896
Looks like you're doing fine.

533
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,133
Brother, only you'll be fine
in the place you live.

534
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,537
Always making fun.

535
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,239
- Are you here to watch the film?
- No, to take a skirt.

536
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,473
Didn't l tell you Nallathambi speaks morals?

537
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:53,445
ls it moral?

538
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,811
ls he your friend?

539
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,987
Forget about him,
he's a useless guy.

540
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,155
Buddy, you've a match box.

541
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,279
Do you've extra ticket?

542
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,981
- No tickets.
- What's this?

543
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:06,596
lsn't the theatre like festival with
release of Ajith and Vijay's films?

544
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,322
lf this is like this, what if they
both act in the same film?

545
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,661
No chance, Thala is different
from Thalapathy.

546
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,497
Both can't unite.

547
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,866
They have already united, boss.
What are you saying?

548
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:20,009
A man is running a saloon on the
names of Thala and Thalapahty.

549
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:24,473
lt seems both the fans of Thala and
Thalapathy must come to him.

550
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:29,813
But fans must fight each other but
he'll make money and be happy.

551
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,612
ls itjustice?

552
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,020
Who is he?
Where is he?

553
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:37,422
The man in white talking
to the skin head.

554
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,920
Be careful, he can't take it much.

555
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,858
Did you see how l lit the fire?

556
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,529
- Greetings Thala.
- Greetings, welcome.

557
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:46,634
Ajith fans association.

558
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:52,104
Your hero has many fans, this year
your hero's film will be great hit.

559
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,436
Thalapathy, l'm from Vijay
fans association.

560
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,639
l thought you're Jai Shankar fan,
are you Vijay's fan?

561
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,215
Don't worry, your hero's film
will also be a great hit.

562
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,783
Why that name Thala and Thalapahty?

563
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,386
Make it Thala.

564
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,450
Or make it Thalapathy.

565
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:11,254
You're kids, you don't know
the philosophy of life,

566
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,157
a coin has two sides,

567
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,956
life has happiness and sorrows,

568
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,029
like that everything is same,

569
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,131
sky and earth,

570
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,268
day and night,
sun and moon,

571
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,334
good and bad,

572
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,766
if you get deep into the life...

573
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,963
We asked about Thala and Thalapathy,

574
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,142
but you're speaking like Kamalahassan
which no one can understand.

575
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,481
They don't know to respect people.

576
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:34,816
Blood...blood.

577
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,146
Thanks.
They are not decent like you.

578
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,654
We are worse than them.

579
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:46,793
Why are you bleeding?

580
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,659
Who dared to beat Thala Thalapthy?

581
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:52,664
What?

582
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:54,661
Leave it.

583
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:58,308
Buddy! Why don't you start a ladies
beauty parlour on Asin and Trisha?

584
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,773
To beaten up by all heroes.

585
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,468
lt's routine for a warrior.

586
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,447
Come...come...move..move...
give way to Thalapathy.

587
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,286
What happened?
Why are they waiting outside?

588
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:17,119
Has any oldie kicked the bucket?

589
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:29,464
Hey you Nithya!

590
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,470
What happened?

591
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:36,311
Mother! Brother has come!
Brother has come.

592
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:37,502
What happened?

593
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,910
Do you've any sense?

594
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:44,076
You're roaming irresponsibly,
why are you interfering in brother's life?

595
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,653
You'll never reform.

596
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,756
What's the time now? lt's 3.45 am!

597
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,358
Coming home at this hour,
you'll never reform.

598
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:53,530
l had fixed your brother's marriage
and first night time,

599
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,221
why did you do like this, fool?

600
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,200
What happened?
Why is everyone chiding me?

601
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,130
You readied the room for first night,
where's the key?

602
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,234
Key is up...

603
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,775
How did this key get into my pocket?
Silly idiot! Give the key.

604
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,350
Good job son, l'll...

605
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,852
Where did you go? l was trying
to reach you on mobile.

606
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:22,923
- Didn't get the line.
- Didn't get it?

607
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,924
Battery low, got switched off.

608
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,802
Why didn't you break open the door?

609
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,371
You want to break open on
first night, will it be good?

610
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:40,304
What would the new bride
think about us?

611
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:46,240
What happened?

612
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,386
Though very late marriage,
l brought you milk sweets for first night.

613
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:53,613
But it got ruined.

614
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,557
What am l to do with sweets?

615
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:02,691
Pour it on your head.
Clear out before l kill you.

616
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,798
Get out.

617
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,734
Great comedy!

618
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,905
Ruined brother's life and
says it's comedy.

619
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:09,902
One minute.

620
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,738
l'm the one who is affected
but l'm cool and quiet,

621
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:15,907
why are you all getting tensed?

622
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,411
Would anyone do it wantonly?

623
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,242
l'm sure it would've
happened unwittingly.

624
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:24,610
l beg you all to please clear out.

625
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:25,914
Sister-in-law, one minute.

626
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,995
Sister-in-law, l am...sorry.

627
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,596
lt happened unwittingly.

628
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,099
Partying with friends?

629
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,165
Come in.

630
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:42,503
Please come in.

631
00:45:43,107 --> 00:46:03,291
AYNGARAN DVD

632
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:07,786
For the good work he had done,
for his good heart,

633
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:11,195
he'll get married very soon,
note it down.

634
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,699
Thank you sir.
Useless life.

635
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,299
lt's late night, you sleep here, l'll go.

636
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:18,371
Okay father.

637
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,635
A small doubt.

638
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,508
Will you be in the room
in your first night,

639
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:29,652
or roam around the city locking
door and taking the key?

640
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,713
Just to clear a doubt.

641
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,216
Mongoose head is also taunting me.

642
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,005
Sister! Brother-in-law is tensed.

643
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,644
Be careful with him.

644
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,074
Keep quiet, he may hear you.

645
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:57,747
Nothing.

646
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,108
- What's it?
- Nothing.

647
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,841
He has done like this
who am l to...

648
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:05,919
- You sleep in the upstairs.
- Okay mother-in-law.

649
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,351
- Don't take it to your heart.
- No regrets.

650
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,525
Okay, go.

651
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:13,761
- You go to sleep, l'll sleep.
- One minute, come here.

652
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,026
- What?
- Hold this.

653
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:16,961
Hold it.

654
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,326
- Sleep there.
- Mother!

655
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,629
Why are you like this?

656
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,399
You know what's the time now?
There's a time for everything.

657
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:25,540
Sleep there.

658
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:27,941
Go!

659
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:32,942
Go l say!

660
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:34,545
Why are you still here?

661
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:40,617
What has happened to him?

662
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:53,368


663
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,964
My bad luck l'm your elder brother!

664
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,535
Sister-in-law managed such
a big problem easily.

665
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,906
Very brave girl.

666
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:11,679
What's the guaranty that she'll not ask
about me and my joblessness?

667
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,981
She'll definitely ask.

668
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,714
Mustn't give her an opportunity.

669
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,187
Must put an end to it.

670
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:18,924
Mother.

671
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,763
l told you many times not to sit there.

672
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,158
Leave it mother.

673
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,759
What's your opinion about
your daughter-in-law?

674
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:25,935
ls she okay?

675
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,103
She's very smart.

676
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,938
That's what l'm saying,
she's very smart.

677
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,167
She may cross our line, be ware.

678
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:34,935
Shut up.

679
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:39,844
lf she enacts drama of reforming me
like in film 'Vanathapola'.

680
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,745
l'll get tensed.

681
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,351
What will you getting tensed?

682
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:44,551
l'll break the family.

683
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,518
l'll make them leave this house.

684
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,948
ldiot! Go!
Mother.

685
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:52,060
Tell your daughter-in-law about me.

686
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,025
What else work you've other than this.

687
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:57,461
lf she crosses my path,
then l'll get tensed...

688
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,466
Nothing, he's tensed
for food getting late.

689
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,036
He's always like this.

690
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,704
Come and have food.

691
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:04,905
You come dear.

692
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,808
Please come here.

693
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,883
Your brother has told me
everything about you.

694
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:23,721
You don't worry,
l'll never cross your line.

695
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,828
l don't need it.

696
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,891
Because l'm here to live
with my husband only,

697
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,329
not to reform anyone.

698
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:38,101
Moreover Baskar,
without any worry or bother,

699
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,742
one must be really lucky to
live a happy-go-lucky life.

700
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:42,405
You're very lucky.

701
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,414
For God's sake,
please don't change.

702
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,184
Be happy like this all your life.

703
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:51,251
That's my wish. Okay?

704
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,516
What's this everything is
happening in reverse?

705
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:58,626
l don't get it.

706
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,727
How are the hens?

707
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:04,025
- The injections...
- Leave it doctor.

708
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:10,201
Was you first night successful?
ls everything okay?

709
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:12,534
Why are you adding salt to injury?

710
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:22,546
Have you told everything about me
to your wife in one day?

711
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,813
Are you in a poultry farm?
l hear chicks noise.

712
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,390
l'm furious on you.
Please cut the call.

713
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:36,388
Stop...stop...stop.
Stop l say!

714
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,065
- Wait...why are you rushing?
- Go!

715
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:41,231
Just now l met the astrologer,

716
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,736
he said tonight is okay for
yesterday's cancelled first night.

717
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,409
But on one condition.

718
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,078
lt seems bride and groom must
enter the room before 8 pm.

719
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,411
That's all!

720
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:54,910
What is he doing?

721
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,243
He's feeling shy.

722
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,918
Yesterday's first night got
cancelled because of me,

723
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,684
l'm very sad about it,
l couldn't sleep last night.

724
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,588
Brother.

725
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,924
That's why l went to meet
astrologer early morning.

726
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:11,599
By God's grace,
it was fixed for tonight.

727
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,863

Must go to market...must
meet him...many things to do...

729
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:20,772
Would you like to have cool drink?

730
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:22,535
Today is auspicious day,

731
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,349
don't know if flower seller will
be there or not...

732
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,212
l must search and find him...
Give me.

733
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,952
One, two, three, four...
that's okay.

734
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,454
What?

735
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:45,029
Jasmine...buy extra.

736
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:49,904
- Jasmine? Okay.
- Be careful!

737
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:56,644
Tell me, l'm on terrace.
What's the matter?

738
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:00,478
Then, you never told me.
lt seems it's fixed for tonight.

739
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,650
What has been fixed?
l don't know anything.

740
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:08,155
That is...what got cancelled yesterday.
lt seems it's fixed for tonight.

741
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,485
ls it?
What are you saying?

742
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,323
l don't know anything.

743
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:13,993
Mother-in-law didn't
tell me anything.

744
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,160
How can she not tell such
an important matter...

745
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,595
What happened?
Who is on the phone?

746
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:23,234
That is...your son wants
to tell you something.

747
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,508
Hello! Are you feeling shy?

748
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,178
l'm also feeling shy.

749
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,849
What are you blabbering Saravanan?

750
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:35,945
- Hello...mother!
- What?

751
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,188
ls it okay if l come home
by 6.30 or 7.30 pm?

752
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:40,617
Why do you want to come so early?

753
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:43,916
lt seems must enter by 8 pm,
some formality.

754
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,618
Has your wife paid condition
on day one itself?

755
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,694
No way.

756
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:51,527
Now that you're married,
you must earn more.

757
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,362
Come home leisurely after
completing your work.

758
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,695
Mother, not that...

759
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,537
What was cancelled yesterday
is fixed for today,

760
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,935
and must enter the room
before 8 pm, Boss said so.

761
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,303
Why are you so eager?

762
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:04,373
We've fixed it next week
on an auspicious day.

763
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,981
Silly, cut the call and
mind your work.

764
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:09,647
Next week?

765
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:18,584

00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,167
Which scheme would you require, sir?

769

missing a day, but must be free.

772
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,577
You must go personally to speak.

773
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,581
There's a scheme for
your requirement.

774
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,413

00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:46,680
Please fill this form.

776
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,820
lf you knew they would ask
you to fill form in English,

777
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,085
you wouldn't have come
to buy a phone, right?

778
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:53,159
Shut up.

Buddy, say something.

784
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,940
Sir is English professor
in local college.

785
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,606
He eats only pizzas and burgers.

786
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,840
Fill the other columns by yourself.

00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:16,277
Add in between deer,
honey, golden deer.

788

He doesn't like recommendations.
But still l'll support your case.

00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:39,704
But on one condition.

796
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,639
When you quit this job,
you must get it for my friend.

797
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:43,813
- Definitely sir.
- Thanks.

798
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,140

00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,318
- Sit down...sit down...
- Good morning madam.

00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,753
Vehicle needs a bumper...

00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,587
Hereafter this is your number...
Boss (A) Baskaran.

803
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:01,922
What's this? Who wrote this?

804
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,926
Will you answer me or not?

805
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:09,000
- Brother told me to give you.
- Brother? Who? Whose brother?

806
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,173
Brother to all of us
and Boss to you.

807
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:13,837
Silence...silence...

808
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:17,005
Open it madam...open it.

809
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,848
Answer it, the call is for
you only, madam.

810
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:26,347
Hello!

811
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,518
Vehicle needs a bumper...
life needs temper...

812
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:35,528
Hereafter this is your number...
l'm Baskaran here.

813
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:40,733
Look! How is my gift?

814
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:43,634
We can talk freely for hours.

815
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:49,540
24 hours, 365 days,
anytime or all time, it's free.

816
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,337
- Did you like it?
- Pardon?

817
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:55,210
Why are you always repeating
the same word?

818
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,280
Now that we are one family.

819
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,546
You speak in Tamil with all but
with me it's always English.

820
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:01,155
- This is too much.
- Pardon?

821
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,884
- Say it once again.
- Pardon.

822
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,824
- Loudly!
- Pardon!

823
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,555
- Stretch it.
- Pardon!

824
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,735
The girl is asking you to sing.

825
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:17,066
She's young so feeling shy,
she has cut the word short.

826
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,240
Buddy, though you failed in sixth class,
you're a genius in English.

827
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,076
Not everyone is so fortunate.

828
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,849
Next time when you see her,
sing a good Tamil song.

829
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,344
- Okay.
- Wait.

830
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:32,254
- Sing a song for sample.
- Do l've to sing?

831
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:36,091
Hail Lord Siva...

832
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:39,928
You fool! Singing that eat the girl alive.

833
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,759
Will you sing this for a girl?
Sing a romantic song.

834
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,197
- Romantic?
- Okay?

835
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,338
Excuse me...one minute.

836
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,274
Only thing, l tell.

837
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,010
New sari, beautiful...
very very beautiful.

838
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,611
- Pardon?
- Song?

839
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:04,219
Kiss me to light fire...
Didn't she like the song?

840
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:09,285
My head is reeling...
l'm swooning on seeing you...

841
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:12,950
When you come near,
l'm scared...

842
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:14,630
Excuse me...
what are you trying to do man?

843
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:17,231
You were going on asking me to sing.

844
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,298
That's why l sang.

845
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:21,129
Pardon doesn't mean
l'm asking you to sing.

846
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,805
l didn't get you what you said,
come out more clearly.

847
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,066
You've spoken in Tamil now.
Now you spoke in Tamil, right?

848
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,336
- For that only, how is it?
- Very smart.

849
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:33,706
- Hey!
- What's it, buddy?

850
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,044
l told my boy not to tell you
where l am, did he tell you?

851
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:38,083
l'll punch you. Bloody Englishman!

852
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,983
Either say you know
or you don't know.

853
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,987
Why do you claim you know everything?

854
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,658
Tell me what had happened?

855
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:52,834
Pardon means, didn't get you?

856
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,093
l think she's speaking British English.

857
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,933
l was embarrassed singing
song before her.

858
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,675
But buddy, before leaving,

859
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,378
she left saying very smart
with a smile.

860
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,173
What's the meaning of that smile?

861
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,183
lt means l'll be
a laughing stock to all.

862
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,352
Check if oil is leaking from silencer.

863
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,612
Answer me.

864
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:17,284
For girls, if boys talk too much,
they're saw.

865
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,791
if they don't talk, they're big bore,

866
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,189
if they speak in Tamil,
they're locals,

867
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:21,522
if they speak in English,
they're city guys.

868
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:22,959
if they speak with smile,
they're oglers,

869
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,190
if they speak without smile,
they're robots,

870
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,196
that's you.

871
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:28,370
But for boys, girls are just two types.

872
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:31,802
One is super figure,
another is ordinary figure.

873
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:35,307
Your girl is super figure,
you'll get her, don't worry.- How?

874
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:39,375
l'll do something which you can't.
l'll give a romantic look.

875
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:43,882
lf you observe and deliver it to her.
She'll fall for you.

876
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:45,888
Watch carefully.

877
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:50,216
Keep the tongue left...
slowly...come to right...

878
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:52,223
- turn fast...
- Don't spit here sir.

879
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:56,562
Let's practice there.

880
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,071
Why did you keep your face like that?

881
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,077
ls my face romantic?

882
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:15,080
lt's like Sridevi of film 'Moondrampirai'.
Like mad.

883
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:17,583
l taught you a reaction, show it.

884
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,422
You did one before, mix both.

885
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:24,085
This is it...use it.
That's it. Fixed.

886
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,423
- Your girl is here.
- Where? Shall tell her now?

887
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,591
Wait...why are you rushing?

888
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,767
Will she turn into male
in 5 minutes?

889
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:36,098
Don't rush. You must be patient.
You've phone?

890
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,933
- l do.
- ls it charged?

891
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:39,602
- Do you've headphone?
- l do.

892
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:40,776
Plug it into ears.

893
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:45,047
l'll keep on sending instructions.

894
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,615
Just follow it and move the coins.
She'll fall for you.

895
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,050
Let's have party evening, go now.

896
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,781
Go.

897
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,385
What are you waiting for? Go!

898
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:14,105


899
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,812
Are you taking my blessing stealthily?

900
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:19,542
l'm Sarat Kumar of film 'Sooriyavamsam'.

901
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:20,807
You're Devayanai.

902
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,417
Taking my blessing stealthily,
you're appearing for lAS.

903
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,645
Don't make me angry, go.

904
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,323
You're friend!

905
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:31,319
Don't know what else he's up to?

906
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:37,761

907
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,158
Here...here...

908
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:44,231
Thanks.

909
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,499
Sun will not fall if bus turns.

910
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:58,111
- Tell me buddy.
- Why are you rushing?

911
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,618
Buddy, l'm tensed.

912
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,346
She's sitting silently,
shall l tell her now?

913
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:03,115
Are you going to say
good morning to her now?

914
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,083
This is a life time decision.

915
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,023
Love must be expressed
at appropriate time.

916
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,960
l've two kids, experienced hand,
listen to me.

917
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,532

your experience, buddy.

918
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,873
lt's okay, you carry on.
l'm leaving.

919
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,702
Buddy, wait...
l'll follow your instructions. Okay?

920
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:34,555
lt's scary to me also.
Reduce it.

921
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,218
Fix it this one. Okay.

922
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,121
Driver has come, do you remember
the dialogues l taught you?

923
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:43,389
Deliver it in the same modulation.
Rock it, buddy, all the best...bye...

924
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:49,298
l don't think you're beautiful.

925
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,906
l never felt like falling
in love with you.

926
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:57,075
He said something else too...
l fear all this may come true.

927
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,976
Hello...talking to you...
Hello...hello...stop...

928
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,080
Disaster!

929
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,916
- When are you giving party, buddy?
- l'll beat you.

930
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,523
l would've expressed
it myself better.

931
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,753
You said modulation and
it's a disaster now.

932
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,096
Who gave you this idea?

933
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,330
l don't love you.

934
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:20,765
l don't like you.

935
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,765
l don't think you're beautiful.

936
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:25,097
But l fear all this may come true.

937
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,540
Won't he say it directly?

938
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,870
Will he say it beating
around the bush?

939
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:31,339
Forget about him,
how did you say it?

940
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:34,509
How did l say it?
l don't think you're beautiful.

941
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,713
l never felt like falling
in love with you.

942
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,513
But l fear all this may come true,
bus left before l could complete it.

943
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:43,123
l told you to say like Madhavan
in film 'Alaipayuthey'.

944
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,122
You've delivered it like
Rajkiran of film 'Aranmanaikkili'.

945
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,956
Who will dare love you?
Don't shout on me.

946
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,759
Buddy, everyone has his own style.

947
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,627
l can do what is possible
for me, right?

948
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:55,303
My bad luck to ask advice from
a two kid father like you.

949
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,073
Hello...hello...one minute.
Excuse me.

950
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,682
You said l'm not beautiful
and you don't like me.

951
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:13,014
- Why are you after me then?
- Missed the timing.

952
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,588
Did you see film 'Alaipayuthey'
on TV?

953
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,589
l too watched it.

954
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,753
We've come so far,

May invite me for a coffee.
You can invite me for snacks also.

956
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:30,194
lf you follow me and
do comedy, l'll smile,

957
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:33,569
but won't get impressed.
Find another girl for it. Okay?

958
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:38,211
You know the meaning
of impress, right?

959
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:47,682
Wait...wait...

960
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,950
Okay. You'll not get impressed
with my comical approach.

961

01:03:54,564 --> 01:04:00,127
Helping the blind to cross the road.
Helping orphan children.

01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,904
Offering seats to old women in bus.

964
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,801
Would you be impressed if l do
anything serious like these acts?

965
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:10,137
- What are you trying to say?
- Okay, don't get tensed.

966
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:17,150
l'm saying it openly,
l don't know how to flatter you.

967
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:22,323
You tell me how should l flatter you,

968
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,493
l'm not able to...
try to understand me.

969
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:29,596
Why are you laughing?
Please tell me.

01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:51,580


971
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:57,750
She turned me into a paper boat...

972
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,691
She flattered me raising my pulse...

973
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:08,201
Refilling my empty pen with wine...

974
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:12,301
She broke by intoxicating me...

l don't know what l'm singing
and what l'm saying...

976

Don't know where l'm going
and what l'm doing...

977
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:28,550
You're mine, your mom is
my mother-in-law...

01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,757
But you're not proud of it.
That is more important.

1033
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:39,532
My family likes you very much.
Okay to me also.

1034
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:46,434
To sum it up, you've all the qualities
to take good care of me all my life.

1035
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:54,047
l love you.

1036
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,049
l've decided to marry you.

1037
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,315
They say something...

1038
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,045
Congratulations...
congratulations.

1039
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:03,120
Just a minute.
What's this?

1040
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:07,394
You came, you proposed,
you congratulated me,

1041
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:10,557
how can you be so confident
about which would never happen?

1042
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,833
That would never happen?
Who said so? Trust me.

1043
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:18,562
Don't write off me like other boys.
l'll not discard you.

1044
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,839
Don't let your heart waver.
Okay?

1045
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:25,070
Whatever it is, talk to my people
or else talk to my sister.

1046
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,578
First get out of the class.

1047
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,310
What if your sister says okay?

1048
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:31,415
l'll think over it.

1049
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,756
Then, it's okay to you also.
l'll talk to your sister.

1050
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,421
What's the matter, Baskar?

1051
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:45,430
Nothing, very important matter.
Thinking how to start it.

1052
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,937
l gave a good thought
about it, sister-in-law.

1053
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,766
How long should l've to be
alone in life?

1054
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,837
So l've decided to enter
the next stage of life.

1055
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:57,712
Next stage?
l didn't get you.

1056
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,615
- l've decided to marry, sister-in-law.
- Marry?

1057
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,778
- You?
- Yes, sister-in-law.

1058
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,121
l like your sister,
she too likes me very much.

1059
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,552
Talk to your people and fix it quickly,

1060
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,382
because good things mustn't
be postponed.

1061
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:12,389
That's why.

1062
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,622
No jokes please, l've lot of work.

1063
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:19,631
Please wait, sister-in-law.
l'm notjoking, l'm serious.

1064
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,199
Talk to your father.
When will you talk to him?

1065
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:29,309
l'll talk to him,
definitely l'll talk to him.

1066
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,643
l've to talk a lot,
can we sit and talk?

1067
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,308
l can talk to him like this.

1068
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:40,483
My husband's brother Baskar
is very good man,

1069
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:43,157
he's a gentleman,
he'll not do any work,

1070
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:47,661
loiters around happily,
he'll not listen to anyone's advice,

1071
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:52,757
from the dress he's wearing to bike,
everything is bought by my husband,

1072
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:58,172
after marriage, he'll run the family by
taking money from brother every month.

1073
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,669
He has such great characters,

1074
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,840
so you can trust and give your
daughter in marriage to him, father.

1075
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,009
shall l talk to him like that?

1076
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:06,844
Stop Baskar, one minute.

1077
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,847
You've a sister of
marriageable age, right?

1078
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:11,750
Do you remember it?

1079
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,187
Would your family approve
a groom like you for her?

1080
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,451
Tell me.

1081
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:23,289
Baskar, don't mistake me.
l'm not talking as your sister-in-law,

1082
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,357
you don't like me talking as
sister-in-law, you'll get angry,

1083
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:31,138
then you'll split the family,
l want the family to remain united.

1084
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:33,140
You asked for her
hand in marriage.

1085
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:36,273
That's why l'm talking as
the bride's sister.

1086
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:45,049
Do something in life that's worth,
then come and seek her hand.

1087
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,883
Food is ready, l forgot to tell you.

1088
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:55,325
Have food and go quickly,
friends would be waiting in saloon.

1089
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,055
Your schedule may change.

1090
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:15,783
AYNGARAN DVD

1091
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:18,577
- ls food ready?
- Yes, coming.

1092
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,084
Make it fast.

1093
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,153
Do it patiently, mad!

1094
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:26,926
Take it.

1095
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,156
Where are you going out
at this hour?

1096
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:33,826
l'm asking you,
where are you going?

1097
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:36,735
Mad boy! Tell me.

1098
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:39,203
- l'm leaving home.
- No jokes please.

1099
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:41,273
Look at the face of
man leaving home.

1100
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,573
Your brother is leaving home.

1101
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,441
Leave it, l feel something good
is going to happen

1102
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:52,452
Got bored roaming locally,
are you going out to roam?

1103
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:53,848
l'm leaving home.

1104
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:56,457
Slowly...slowly...

1105
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:57,682
Mother...

1106
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,121
- Nithya...come here.
- Yes brother.

1107
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,194
Boss is saying something,
listen to him.

1108
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:04,826
- Where are you going?
- l'm leaving home.

1109
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,557
Sweep home?

1110
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,032
No need to do it,
you'll not do that also cleanly.

1111
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,000
l'll do it myself.

1112
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:14,471
He says he's leaving home not sweep,
he'll stand on his own legs.

1113
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,940
Why are you beating her?
What happened to you?

1114
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:20,706
l don't work and don't earn,
so you look down up on me.

1115
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,643
- l'm going.
- Super!

1116
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:28,647
Why are you leaving home now?

1117
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,848
You're asking me but the one
who is responsible for it.

1118
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:32,219
l'll tell you, mother-in-law.

1119
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:35,956
He came to me seeking Chandrika's
hand in marriage.

1120
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:38,029
What's this?

1121
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:41,930
- l'm not aware of anything.
- No problem, mother-in-law.

1122
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:45,072
l just asked if you'd accept a groom
like him for Nithya.

1123
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:46,070
Did l ask anything wrong,
mother-in-law?

1124
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,004
What's wrong in it?

1125
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,178
Who will accept a jobless man?

1126
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,847
l've been watching you all,
you say about my joblessness,

1127
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,016
and sister's marriage,

1128
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,650
won't l earn?

1129
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,150
ln just six months,
l'll arrange her marriage.

1130
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:00,514
All expenses are on me.

1131
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,088
Nobody need to spend a penny.

1132
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:05,254
lf that doesn't happen?

1133
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,291
l'll never come back to this home.

1134
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:10,693
lf l do it, will you get your
sister married to me?

1135
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,635
First do it, then challenge.
Now you go.

1136
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:15,894
He's angry, why are you asking him...

1137
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:19,562
Why are you stopping me, mother?
Don't you've faith in me?

1138
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:20,867
l'll earn, mother.

1139
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,704
- l'll arrange your marriage.
- What's this brother?

1140
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:27,043
Okay...okay Saravana,
you play the game.

1141
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,876
Eat well...acting on wife's orders.

1142
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:32,281
Baskar, listen to me.
Saravana, stop him.

1143
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,951
Leave him, let him go.
Where will he go?

1144
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:42,925
ls this life a riddle?

1145
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:54,299
Who will solve it?

1146
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,104
Like my hand beating me...

1147
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:02,909
Like my finger hurting my eye...

1148
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:09,455
My eyes which never cried is
today a pond of tears...

1149
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:17,296
There's no one to pacify...

1150
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,295
l'll return after earning money.
Don't call me back.

1151
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:27,574
Just a minute, Boss.
Don't force me, l'll not come back.

1152
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:32,236
No, it's raining, you may come
back citing this reason.

1153
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:35,143
So, l came to give an umbrella.
Keep it.

1154
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,814
Okay, all the best.

1155
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:54,032
Rain will stop in 10 minutes,
then have to work like fire.

1156
01:17:55,971 --> 01:18:00,169
- What you're doing is not good?
- What isn't good?

1157
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:04,439
l asked for coffee but nobody moved,
so l made it myself.

1158
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:05,704
What's wrong in it?

1159
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:08,576
What are you saying?
Bring him back.

1160
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,718
Brother, please bring him back.

1161
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:14,320
Did l send him out?

1162
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,616
He went on his own challenging
to arrange her marriage.

1163
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:19,988
Try to understand, people will talk
bad about our family.

1164
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,685
What will they say?

1165
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,696
New daughter-in-law has
divided the family.

1166
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,692
That's all, l'll take it.

1167
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:30,032
lf Baskar reforms that's
enough for me.

1168
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:32,573
l don't mind anyone
else's comments.

1169
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:36,274
You may not be worried
but it's hurting me.

1170
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:39,675
When their father died,
Saravana was older,

1171
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,314
he could understood,

1172
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:45,282
she was an infant,
she never knew anything,

1173
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:48,149
but he was adolescent,

1174
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:52,824
he used to pester me why am l
not sporting dot or flowers,

1175
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:58,056
and wanted to visit temple
or go out,

1176
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:03,432
he was very smart as kid,
he used to study very well,

1177
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,230
ask him if you've doubt,

1178
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:07,907
may be l spoilt him
pampering too much,

1179
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:11,511
now he's not going to work,
never listens to anyone.

1180
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:14,341
He has taken a good
decision unwittingly,

1181
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:17,450
as he says if he finds
a job in 6 months,

1182
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:21,053
if he earns and arranges
Nithya's marriage,

1183
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:23,816
what else can be more pleasant
than that, mother-in-law?

1184
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:27,927
Only then l can talk to my father
about Baskar's marriage.

1185
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:32,132
Mother, this is the best chance
for Baskar to reform.

1186
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:34,165
Please stop worrying about him.

1187
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:37,702
Please don't call him back,
l'll take care of him.

1188
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:40,936
Nandhini, get ready,
let's go to temple.

1189
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,310
Leave it mother,
they are also right.

1190
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:54,785
He'll reform if such things
happen suddenly.

1191
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,960
Where will he be now?

1192
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:02,626
Where else can he go?
He'll be in Nallathambi's saloon.

1193
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,798
- Tell me sir.
- Let hair look thick.

1194
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:08,636
Don't cut it short.

1195
01:20:09,771 --> 01:20:14,140
Okay, l'll cut and
make it appear thick.

1196
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:15,468
l'm going to Thanjavur to meet
a prospective bride.

1197
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:18,168
ls it? Good news.

1198
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:22,146
How can l make it look thick?
Can fry dosa on it?

1199
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:27,421
What do they think of me, buddy?

1200
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:29,484
Shouldn't a man without
money fall in love?

1201
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:31,215
ls love the domain of only earners?

1202
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:33,894
- Customer...wait...
- Sorry sir.

1203
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:35,619
Won't you tell there's a customer?

1204
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,264
Remove your bags first.

1205
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:38,659
What's going on here?

1206
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:41,495
Please don't take it serious,
my close friend.

1207
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:46,066
- Go out...customer...
- Do it fast.

1208
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,299

ls money everything, buddy?
Won't l earn it?

1210
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,580
Do you know how many people
l had sent to foreign?

1211
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:56,080
They've settled in Singapore,
Malaysia, Dubai..

1212
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:59,117
They are calling everyday and
asking me to come there.

1213
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:02,222
Why didn't l go? Why?
This is my soil.

1214
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:04,688
This is his head.

1215
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,227
Sorry sir, it came out in a flow.

1216
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:07,292
Please sit there.

1217
01:21:07,495 --> 01:21:09,690
- You're not behaving properly.
- Sorry sir.

1218
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:11,765
Who is he? Your friend?

1219
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:14,128
Yes, close friend,
got little emotional.

1220
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:15,030
Please don't take it seriously.
Do it fast,

1221
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:15,794
l must go to meet
a prospective bride.

1222
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:17,232
Okay...okay...
Buddy!

1223
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:20,340
l'll arrange my sister's
marriage in 6 months.

1224
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,908
Will you recite hymns
instead of the priest?

1225
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:25,636
How much will it cost?
Rs.300 thousands?, Half million?

1226
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:28,975
l'll earn it...l'll show them.

1227
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:30,549
He's fool...

1228
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,487
What happened?

1229
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,526
Nothing sir, l'll wax it.

1230
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,700
Sir...sir...l'll make a tattoo design.

1231
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:46,560
- lt'll be fine.
- Get lost!

1232
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:50,563
Though he doesn't have much hair,
he comes every month.

1233
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:57,675
Open the shutter...what are you doing
behind closed shutter?

1234
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:00,347
lf my father-in-law sees this,
he'll burn me alive.

1235
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,081
Open it buddy, listen to me.
Open it.

1236
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,748
What is he doing closing the shutter?

1237
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:10,248
Will he commit suicide by hanging?

1238
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:13,525
You've woke up the sleeping
lion inside me.

1239
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:17,858
Ashok! This day,
make a note of it on your calendar,

1240
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:20,034
if l don't bring your family to street,

1241
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:23,532
my name henceforth shall
not be Annamalai.

1242
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:32,607


1243
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,779
He's sleeping like in
a dentist's chair.

1244
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:38,110
Get up...get up...

1245
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:39,815
Where's my car? Where's my factory?

1246
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,283
Where's my driver Nallathambi?

1247
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:46,457
To get rich in one song,

1248
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:49,562
are you Rajini of Annamalai or
Sarat Kumar of Sooriyavamsam?

1249
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:53,798
Make me your role model and
come up in life step by step.

1250
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:56,937
Buddy, that step by step will
not work out for me.

1251
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:58,628
l must reach top in one day.

1252
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:05,735
You wanted to reach top in one day,
is this top okay to you?

1253
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:10,043
you must climb to the top daily
and make a note of the reading.

1254
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:11,081
That's yourjob.

1255
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:15,086
As you wished you're reaching
top in one day, have a blast.

1256
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,417
Young man, take care of him.

1257
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:24,555
You wanted to reach top
in one day, right?

1258
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:27,564
- Why did you come back midway?
- lt'll not set for me.

1259
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:31,000
Remove the cooling glasses.
Can't tolerate it.

1260
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:33,768
Tell me why will it not set for you?

1261
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:36,307
Buddy, a girl is dependent on me.

1262
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,001
lf l fall down form there
and break my limbs,

1263
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:40,943
- who will take care? Will you?
- l'll cut your finger.

1264
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:42,442
You...

1265
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:45,342
- Your girl.
- What are you murmuring?

1266
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:47,350
Your girl is here.

1267
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:52,452
Buddy, you never told me,

1268
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,457
have you started cutting
hair to ladies also?

1269
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:56,562
- You discuss, l'll wait outside.
- Sit here man.

1270
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:57,459
This is your shop, sit here.

1271
01:23:57,665 --> 01:23:59,292
Say that often that it's my shop.

1272
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:01,469
You spend more time here than me.

1273
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:03,899
Sorry Baskar, l came to know
what had happened in home.

1274
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:06,699
l'm responsible for everything.
lt happened because of me.

1275
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:11,809
But please try to understand.
Sister said like that to reform you.

1276
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:13,480
There's no ulterior motive...

1277
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:17,347
lt means l was a useless,
hopeless and a cheat.

1278
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:18,576
- That's what you're saying, right?
- Yes.

1279
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:20,880
lf not do you own Docomo company?

1280
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:26,159
l didn't mean like that.

1281
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:28,488
- What l'm trying to say is...
- You needn't have to say anything.

1282
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:30,721
Both sisters joined to together
to throw me out of home,

1283
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:32,627
are you play acting now?

1284
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:35,894
Her sister is a lady, you shouldn't
have talked to a lady like that.

1285
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:37,594
What l shouldn't have talked?

1286
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:40,741
l went to college that to ask, can't she
say if she likes me or not?

1287
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:43,035
She insisted on talking to her sister.

1288
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:44,370
This is all part of drama.

1289
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,046
- Unnecessary tension.
- Why unnecessarily tension?

1290
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:47,236
Why are you getting tensed?

1291
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,576
Buddy! Why are you getting tensed?

1292
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,775
This is my matter...
cool...cool...

1293
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,189
Likes me or not, tell her to
come out clearly now.

1294
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:59,190
What l must tell right now?
You dullard!

1295
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:02,791
Would l come here without liking you?

1296
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:08,560
Okay, if l don't go to work
or never earn in life,

1297
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,704
and loiter on roads,
take it for instance.

1298
01:25:10,905 --> 01:25:12,270
Already you're doing it.

1299
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:13,705
Continue.

1300
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:16,107
Would you marry me then?

1301
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:18,740
Why don't you try to understand me?

1302
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:23,279
l can talk about our marriage only after
you start working and earn money.

1303
01:25:26,054 --> 01:25:29,683
Buddy, it seems we must work
and earn money,

1304
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:35,955
buy house, buy car,
then they'll come with broad smile,

1305
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:38,223
didn't l tell you?
This is all drama.

1306
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:40,128
Tell her to leave the place,
let fresh air come in.

1307
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:42,667
l must curse myself for
trying to help you.

1308
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:44,736
Sister...Chandrika sister.
Just a minute.

1309
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:46,634
- Will you listen to me?
- No way.

1310
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,670
Won't you respect your brother's word?

1311
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:50,240
Go man!

1312
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:56,144
- l'm terribly upset.
- Let's have a beer.

1313
01:25:57,485 --> 01:25:58,076
Yes.

1314
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:01,479
You haven't understood Chandrika as
much as you've understood me.

1315
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:03,489
You're my friend!

1316
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:12,928
You wanted a job, l got you one.

1317
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,602
You said a girl is depending on you,
you said you can't, agreed,

1318
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:19,330
now the girl came to meet you,
you sent her out,

1319
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:21,008
what is your problem?

1320
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:24,206
Too high, l can't work from
such great height.

1321
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:27,438
Where will you go to honeymoon
after marriage?

1322
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:30,516
Honeymoon...Ooty...
Kodaikanal...

1323
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:33,950
You go to high places for that...

1324
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:37,521
Don't talk filthy.
Find me anotherjob, l'll do.

1325
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:41,158
Buddy, one of my friend
is in Madras...

1326
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,853
Buddy, can't go to Madras.
lt's too hot there.

1327
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:46,898
Don't know how people live there?
l can't live there.

1328
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:49,092
Yes, it's little hot there.

1329
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:51,636
There's a chemical factory
in Madurantakam...

1330
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:54,467
Skin allergy, buddy.
lt seems it'll affect 3 generations.

1331
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:55,665
l read it in paper.

1332
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:58,107
Should our children be
punished for our sins?

1333
01:26:58,313 --> 01:26:59,541
- You tell me.
- You're right.

1334
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:05,477
- How about marketing job?
- Dog's life.

1335
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,218
Dog's life is better than no life.

1336
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:13,659
- How about driver?
- No guaranty to life.

1337
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:15,726
- Conductor?
- Cheap change job.

1338
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,659
Peon, helper?

1339
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:21,493
Buddy, l've a status.

1340
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:26,831
Would you like to become a hero
in films for your status?

1341
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:31,539
Rajini-Kamal, Vijay-Ajith, Vikram-Surya,
heavy competition, buddy.

1342
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:34,840
The competition is between them,
why is he bothered?

1343
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:39,147
- Politics?
- Buddy, it's sludge!

1344
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:42,755
Will you open a saloon like me?

1345
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:46,122
How can l ruin your
livelihood, buddy?

1346
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:48,591
What do you think you're doing now?
Take your hands off me.

1347
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:55,093
l'm telling from the heart, l swear,
you'll never come good in life.

1348
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:57,703
You'll never come good in life.

1349
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:04,042
Go...go...l'll become Ambani in
6 months, watch out.

1350
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:06,279
How to become Ambani
in 6 months?

1351
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:08,272
This scheme is good.

1352
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,543
Looks like they'll not let me
become Ambani.

1353
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:13,345
- Hello.
- Good morning sir.

1354
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:16,114
l'm Sandhya from lndian Overseas
bank, Kumbakonam branch.

1355
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,383
Sandhya?
Which Sandhya?

1356
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:23,326
You bought a mobile phone on Baskaran's
name from Universal Mobile, right?

1357
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:24,395
Yes.

Have l got caught with

What did you say?

1378
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:15,939
Very good girl who obeys
all my commands.

1379
01:29:16,484 --> 01:29:18,281
lt has become routine to her
to insult me.

lt'll be difficult for you to
seek help from relative.

1387
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:40,370
lf you needed money,
you could've come straight to me.

She has work, she's leaving.

You...? Please sit here.
Please sit down.

1410
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,828
You don't know how much
loan you need,

01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:14,865
you don't know what industry
you're going to start,

1412
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:18,930
you don't have any degree too,

1413
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,201
how could you dare come
to bank seeking loan?

1414
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:26,709
- You've wasted my 10 minutes.
- Hey!?

1415
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:33,546

AYNGARAN DVD

1420
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,187
Sorry Baskar,
l saw your missed call.

1421
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:10,186
l was in a seminar in college,
so got late.

1422
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:13,026
Forget it, did you get the loan?
How much did you get?

1423
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:14,023
Go...

1424
01:32:17,064 --> 01:32:17,962
Did l ask you?

1425
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:21,532
l'm struggling to survive,
did l ask you to get me loan?

1426
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:24,437
You called on your own,
you asked me to come on your own,

1427
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,539
and get me stuck with
that mongoose head.

1428
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:29,537
He'll humiliate me.
That's the idea, right?

1429
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:31,936
Was it your long term plan?

1430
01:32:32,146 --> 01:32:34,137
Do you and your fatherjoin
together to scheme this?

1431
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:37,546
Wait.

1432
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:39,650
Answer me.

1433
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:45,321
Are you angry for telling truth
about your father?

1434
01:32:45,993 --> 01:32:49,121
Earlier both sisters joined together
to throw me out of home,

1435
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,560
now father and daughter
joined to humiliate me,

1436
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:53,734
- super family!
- Don't talk too much.

1437
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:55,226
My bad luck l tried to advice you.

1438
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:58,337
Neither l like advice
nor those who give it.

1439
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,734
l know how to run my life.

1440
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:05,306
Move!

1441
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:07,077
Am l not talking to you?

1442
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:12,084
Don't you've any sense?
Why are you insulting me in public?

1443
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:15,153
Are you talking about insult?

1444
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:19,258
You call into AC room to insult,
shouldn't we do it in public?

1445
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:21,094
ls itjustice?

1446
01:33:21,295 --> 01:33:22,694
That's okay, what should l do now?

1447
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:24,865
For God's sake,
please don't talk to me.

1448
01:33:25,132 --> 01:33:27,657
Either you taunt me or give lecture.

1449
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:30,699
What a sort of a girl you are!
Leave me alone.

1450
01:33:31,305 --> 01:34:45,408


1451
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:49,009
Hey Muruga! ls it you?
lt's been long time since l saw you.

1452
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:53,076
Are you still roaming like mad man?

1453
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:55,354
l told you while in eight class,

1454
01:34:55,556 --> 01:34:57,524
stay away from wine shop
owner's daughter Aishwarya,

1455
01:34:57,725 --> 01:34:59,352
she'll not match you,
you didn't listen to me.

1456
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:03,360
What happened? They hit your head
and left you mad on streets.

1457
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:07,299
Muruga! l'm asking you ignorantly,

1458
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:14,936
have you ever seen any girl going
mad in love and roaming on streets?

1459
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:18,536
l think you haven't understood it.
Come, let's sit and discuss.

1460
01:35:18,746 --> 01:35:20,714
Stop...don't run.

1461
01:35:20,915 --> 01:35:23,884
Give me your phone number,
l'll give you missed call.

1462
01:35:24,585 --> 01:35:28,214
He ran away in fear without
giving number, bloody crook.

1463
01:35:28,923 --> 01:35:54,943


1464
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:56,817
What?

1465
01:35:57,852 --> 01:36:02,050
Surprized to see me coming for you
after promising not to talk to you.

1466
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:06,720
You're beautiful and
attractive girl, that's why.

1467
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:08,053
Got it?

1468
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:15,861
Taking the chance,
you can do it, Baskar,

1469
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:18,300
every man has a talent in him, Baskar,

1470
01:36:19,006 --> 01:36:22,772
if you start taking such class,
l'll kill you.

1471
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:27,145
What? Would l say yes to
anything you say?

1472
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:33,579
Would l take chances if you
put hand on my shoulders?

1473
01:36:39,059 --> 01:36:40,151
Even if you hug me...

1474
01:36:48,569 --> 01:37:18,526


1475
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:24,432
My legs are flying in air...

1476
01:37:24,805 --> 01:37:29,606
Clouds are moving on earth...

1477
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:34,713

lt's hot and cold...
lt's all because of you...

1480
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:49,861
Like a golden word you planted
a kiss on my cheek...

1481
01:37:50,064 --> 01:37:54,967
lt's asking for a pair again...
on the lips...

1482
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:59,970
Heart is wet and turned heavy...

1483
01:38:00,174 --> 01:38:05,134
Unknown yearning and
thirst of lonliness...

1484
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:09,976
My legs are flying in air...

1485
01:38:10,317 --> 01:38:15,186
Clouds are moving on earth...

1486
01:38:15,589 --> 01:38:44,613


1487
01:38:45,619 --> 01:38:50,181
Adam was charmed by Eve's kiss...

1488
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:55,093
Later on it created
infighting among the men...

1489
01:38:55,796 --> 01:39:00,130
Sound of kiss will never cease...

1490
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:05,032
Earth moves only on kisses...

1491
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:15,547
Kiss is our start and end...
Kiss me...kiss me...my dear...

1492
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:20,880
A kiss can make any man
into superman...

1493
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:26,048
Kiss will electrify the body...

1494
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:30,890
My legs are flying in air...

1495
01:39:31,231 --> 01:39:35,998
Clouds are moving on earth...

1496
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:55,682


1497
01:39:56,490 --> 01:40:00,859
A mother's kiss is Bible of love...

1498
01:40:01,562 --> 01:40:05,931
A father's kiss will impart knowledge...

1499
01:40:06,633 --> 01:40:11,434
Kiss of love force you
to cross the sky...

1500
01:40:11,805 --> 01:40:15,935
That's why you hear victory
bugles everywhere...

1501
01:40:16,143 --> 01:40:26,348
A kiss is changing my life...
Kiss me...kiss me...my dear...

1502
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:31,616
Time and direction is
changing with a kiss...

1503
01:40:31,825 --> 01:40:36,785
Kiss will electrify the body...

- Go...sit there.
- Sit here, buddy.

1525
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:43,622
Listen to me, sit here.

1526
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:45,955
Take it, bye.

1527
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:50,592
600/0 boys have failed, there's no
tutorial college in our area.

1528
01:41:50,804 --> 01:41:52,135
l think it's right time
to start one now.

1529
01:41:52,339 --> 01:41:55,797
lt's concerned with education.
We need brain.

1530
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:58,510
Are we going to start
trusting our intelligence?

1531
01:41:58,712 --> 01:42:01,010
Let's employ well
educated teachers.

1532
01:42:01,215 --> 01:42:03,513
Don't say foolishly.
We need money for it.

1533
01:42:03,717 --> 01:42:06,686
Buddy, if you decide,
you can do it.

1534
01:42:06,887 --> 01:42:11,017
My heart is not of gold
to pawn and get money.

1535
01:42:11,225 --> 01:42:13,159
l don't have a penny, leave me.

1536
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:16,123
Get me loan from someone,
l'll repay it.

1537
01:42:16,363 --> 01:42:18,797
First repay the money you took
yesterday to buy beer.

1538
01:42:18,999 --> 01:42:21,593
- Look at the face to return money.
- Asking beer money also

1539
01:42:22,102 --> 01:42:25,003
l've decided on name also,
Challenge Tutorials.

1540
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:26,172
How is it?

1541
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:30,572
Buddy, l've never seen you
speaking so positively.

1542
01:42:30,777 --> 01:42:32,506
l'll arrange something for that.

1543
01:42:33,213 --> 01:42:34,510
You're my friend!

1544
01:42:35,916 --> 01:42:37,349
- ls brother there?
- He's there.

1545
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:39,680
Come.

1546
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:43,388
Did you see how long we had
to walk for loan?

1547
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:46,855
Forget it buddy, he'll walk more
than us to get back the loan,

1548
01:42:50,297 --> 01:42:50,922
Remove the glasses.

1549
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:53,292
- lt's sunny...
- Remove it l say.

1550
01:42:54,334 --> 01:42:57,633
- l'm seeing proudness in your words.
- Buddy, nothing like that.

1551
01:42:57,971 --> 01:43:02,499
l'm taking loan trusting you.
Please don't betray me, buddy.

1552
01:43:02,709 --> 01:43:06,543
Don't speak inauspicious while
going out on a good work.

1553
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:12,875
l like your speed, just speed
won't do, you need cleverness too.

1554
01:43:13,053 --> 01:43:14,042
Got it?

1555
01:43:14,288 --> 01:43:15,846
Greetings brother.

1556
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:19,219
Public place, shall l come
two steps behind you?

1557
01:43:20,494 --> 01:43:21,483
Cleverness?

1558
01:43:22,462 --> 01:43:24,225
Why are you standing there?
Come here.

1559
01:43:27,935 --> 01:43:31,166
- Brother, looks you're fine.
- Sit down...you too.

1560
01:43:31,772 --> 01:43:35,731
- What brings you here?
- Brother, he's my friend Baskar.

1561
01:43:37,678 --> 01:43:40,909
Son, lower your voice.
lt's hurting my ears.

1562
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:42,445
You carry on, Nallathambi.

1563
01:43:42,649 --> 01:43:46,346
He's my friend Baskar,
he wants to start a tutorial centre,

1564
01:43:46,553 --> 01:43:48,851
very good boy,
he's my only friend,

1565
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:51,854
if you help with loan of
Rs.50000, it'll be very helpful.

1566
01:43:53,193 --> 01:43:55,024
Not a big deal, l'll do it.

1567
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,292
Are you a teacher?

1568
01:43:58,999 --> 01:44:00,762
Yes brother, l'm a teacher.

1569
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:05,831
ls it?
l don't know much about you.

1570
01:44:06,039 --> 01:44:06,767
Give it.

1571
01:44:07,674 --> 01:44:09,437
Take the money you had asked.

1572
01:44:10,477 --> 01:44:11,671
Did you see how fast he is?

1573
01:44:11,878 --> 01:44:13,709
- What did you say your name is?
- Baskar, brother.

1574
01:44:16,183 --> 01:44:17,047
Tell me brother.

1575
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:18,616
- A boy l know...
- Yes brother.

1576
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:20,184
- He has failed 10th class.
- Sorry to hear.

1577
01:44:20,387 --> 01:44:21,547
Admit him also.

1578
01:44:22,456 --> 01:44:26,085
Brother, you're helping us with money,
won't we do this to you?

1579
01:44:26,293 --> 01:44:29,285
- You send the boy, brother.
- Send if there any girls too.

1580
01:44:30,163 --> 01:44:31,027
To make them study well.

1581
01:44:31,231 --> 01:44:33,791
Take money and start the
work immediately.

1582
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:35,830
- Buddy, you take it.
- No, you take it.

1583
01:44:36,036 --> 01:44:36,968
You must take it.

1584
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:39,297
Your hand is lucky hand.
You take it and give me.

1585
01:44:42,009 --> 01:44:45,172
One minute, sign this agreement
and take the money.

1586
01:44:45,379 --> 01:44:47,279
He lends money after
taking auspicious thread,

1587
01:44:47,481 --> 01:44:48,778
was waiting why he hasn't
asked anything? Sign it.

1588
01:44:50,017 --> 01:44:52,315
- Do you've any property?
- No brother.

1589
01:44:52,519 --> 01:44:54,487
- l must earn it hereafter.
- Give it to Nallathambi.

1590
01:44:56,189 --> 01:44:58,020
- Me?
- Sign wherever he shows.

1591
01:44:58,258 --> 01:45:00,818
He'll show back while taking bath,
shall l sign there also? Go!

1592
01:45:01,028 --> 01:45:04,054
Why are you talking among
yourselves? Sign it.

1593
01:45:04,264 --> 01:45:07,165
- Brother, that is...
- My life, buddy.

1594
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:10,832
l've dug the ditch for myself.

1595
01:45:13,874 --> 01:45:15,739
Give water to the buffalo,
look it's shouting.

1596
01:45:15,942 --> 01:45:17,341
Don't wait for good omen.

1597
01:45:17,544 --> 01:45:19,409
Buffalo is crying, without
bothering about sentiment...

1598
01:45:19,613 --> 01:45:24,744
Don't sign...please don't sign...

1599
01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:26,748
Who is it, brother?

1600
01:45:26,953 --> 01:45:28,011
Throw him out.

1601
01:45:28,221 --> 01:45:29,620
Why do you allow mad men inside?

1602
01:45:30,457 --> 01:45:33,358
Mad man!
Still didn't sign it? Sign it.

1603
01:45:34,428 --> 01:45:35,360
Sign it l say.

1604
01:45:35,629 --> 01:45:37,119
Why is he threatening us?

1605
01:45:42,736 --> 01:45:45,364
Didn't l tell about a 10th class fail boy?
My son!

1606
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:51,304
Look, how happy face he is!
My son, isn't he? How is it?

1607
01:45:51,745 --> 01:45:54,077
Father! Did you tell about our
grandpa to the new teacher?

1608
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:55,009
l'll tell.

1609
01:45:55,215 --> 01:45:56,147
Grandpa?

1610
01:45:56,483 --> 01:45:58,041
He's my father Murugan.

1611
01:45:58,251 --> 01:46:00,685
My father was the first man to
study 10th class in my clan.

1612
01:46:00,954 --> 01:46:04,117
10th class is common exam,
to pass it he had an idea.

1613
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:06,656
Who are you two?
Two people are sitting together.

1614
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:10,455
He's my teacher, instead of me
writing what he had taught,

1615
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:12,825
if he writes, it'll be better,
so l've brought him here.

1616
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:14,227
ls it wrong?

1617
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:16,732
l was smarter than my father.

1618
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:19,405
l went to write 10th class exam
learning five words.

1619
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:24,504
Those five letters were,
pass me else kill you.

1620
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:27,506
My son, lion cub!

1621
01:46:27,714 --> 01:46:29,341
He dozes off if it's silent.

1622
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:31,343
Exam hall is silent.

1623
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:33,015
He sleeps there.

1624
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:35,647
lf you wake him up then.

1625
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:45,691
Though not educated, you're running
like a factory with few henchmen.

1626
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:51,435
Nothing, they take loans,
but never keep up their promise.

1627
01:46:51,638 --> 01:46:52,730
All are frauds.

1628
01:46:52,873 --> 01:46:56,070
That's why l've employed them by
signing agreement like you for 2 years.

1629
01:46:56,943 --> 01:47:01,277
Those people cleaning the dung
are mostly teachers like you.

1630
01:47:01,481 --> 01:47:02,880
All are dullards.

1631
01:47:03,016 --> 01:47:04,449
That's why l've made them
clean the dung.

1632
01:47:05,185 --> 01:47:07,153
Why are you standing still?

1633
01:47:07,421 --> 01:47:08,388
Come.

1634
01:47:08,855 --> 01:47:12,154
Tell your friend and get my son
to pass the exam.

1635
01:47:12,526 --> 01:47:18,624
lf he fails, l'll take your shop
and drive your family to streets.

1636
01:47:18,965 --> 01:47:20,364
l'll make you also clean dung.

1637
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,259
Dung?

1638
01:47:21,401 --> 01:47:23,460
Because you signed the document.

1639
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:24,930
That's the rule.

1640
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:28,340
Please get my son
through somehow.

1641
01:47:28,542 --> 01:47:29,406
You will do it.

1642
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:30,405
Take the vehicle.

1643
01:47:32,212 --> 01:47:38,151
To repay gratitude...
joining the wrong side...

1644
01:47:38,318 --> 01:47:44,086
You got betrayed, Karna...

1645
01:47:44,324 --> 01:47:54,632
The betrayer is Kannan...

1646
01:47:55,702 --> 01:48:04,110
The most benevolent heart will never die
that's the rule of God...

1647
01:48:04,377 --> 01:48:08,006
What to do?
l warned you not to sign it.

1648
01:48:08,215 --> 01:48:09,147
You didn't listen, it's all your fate.

1649
01:48:09,282 --> 01:48:11,944
Go and clean the cow dung.

1650
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:22,817
Wittingly or unwittingly
you've caught the tiger's tail.

1651
01:48:23,363 --> 01:48:26,025
lf you release the tail,
tiger will eat you.

1652
01:48:26,233 --> 01:48:29,293
Why are you calling me respectfully?

1653
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:30,629
Why are you saying l've caught it?

1654
01:48:30,837 --> 01:48:31,895
You're saying it'll eat me,

1655
01:48:32,105 --> 01:48:33,732
why are you saying as if
l'm stranger to you.

1656
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:36,500
- We both signed it together.
- lt came in a flow.

1657
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:38,371
We caught it together,
it'll eat both of us.

1658
01:48:38,578 --> 01:48:40,205
We can manage when it eats.

1659
01:48:40,413 --> 01:48:42,574
- What are we going to do now?
- We are doing.

1660
01:48:43,884 --> 01:48:45,408
Let's do something really big!

1661
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:56,686


1662
01:48:57,330 --> 01:48:59,195
God! Save my family from
going to streets.

1663
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:01,697
Buddy, don't trust God,
trust yourself.

1664
01:49:01,902 --> 01:49:03,369
l'm God!

1665
01:49:03,904 --> 01:49:04,962
- Look who is here!
- Greetings sir.

1666
01:49:05,171 --> 01:49:05,899
Who is he?

1667
01:49:06,106 --> 01:49:09,439
- He looks like a cookie seller.
- He's our tutorial teacher.

1668
01:49:09,643 --> 01:49:11,941
My old classmate, very intelligent.

1669
01:49:12,045 --> 01:49:13,910
All the useless guys
are joining together,

1670
01:49:14,114 --> 01:49:15,172
will my tutorial college succeed?

1671
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:17,043
Sir, if you pay advance...

1672
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:18,945
You want pudding before
brushing teeth.

1673
01:49:19,419 --> 01:49:20,511
l'll pay after cutting the ribbon.

1674
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,950
- Okay sir.
- Buddy, we'll cut the ribbon, right?

1675
01:49:23,690 --> 01:49:28,286
- Are you fine?
- Welcome brother...greetings.

1676
01:49:29,429 --> 01:49:31,397
- Why all this?
- Please accept it brother.

1677
01:49:31,598 --> 01:49:32,326
Am l late?

1678
01:49:32,532 --> 01:49:34,432
No brother, just now l came with
sweets, mixture and ribbon.

1679
01:49:34,634 --> 01:49:35,794
What? Sweet and mixture!

1680
01:49:38,371 --> 01:49:39,838
Look how my son is running!

1681
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:42,031
Don't feel sad for cutting
the ribbon and running in.

1682
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:43,834
My son is very lucky.

1683
01:49:44,144 --> 01:49:46,135
l brought 15 buffaloes
after he was born.

1684
01:49:46,346 --> 01:49:48,280
lf you give birth to Yama,
you've to buy buffaloes only.

1685
01:49:48,481 --> 01:49:49,140
What Nallathambi?

1686
01:49:49,349 --> 01:49:51,817
Your son is indeed very lucky,
let's go in.

1687
01:49:52,919 --> 01:49:54,978
- Bless me, l'm like your son.
- Move!

1688
01:49:57,357 --> 01:49:59,848
Baskar, you're very fortunate.

1689
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:04,224
Though if anyone seizes his shop,
even if his family comes to streets,

1690
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:06,160
My family coming to streets,

1691
01:50:06,366 --> 01:50:09,460
why are you announcing often
like train arrival in station?

1692
01:50:09,669 --> 01:50:11,500
Truth must be said, Nallathambi.

1693
01:50:12,038 --> 01:50:15,007
You must be very lucky
to have such a friend.

1694
01:50:15,175 --> 01:50:15,698
Yes brother.

1695
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:17,365
He has taken such
a great risk for you.

1696
01:50:17,644 --> 01:50:19,771
Brother, don't think l'm
saying it arrogantly,

1697
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:22,608
taking risk to him is
like eating rusk.

1698
01:50:23,149 --> 01:50:27,313
l don't know if you eat rusk or
kuska, get my son to pass.

1699
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,954
lf not, you remember, right?

1700
01:50:30,156 --> 01:50:32,784
This Onida head is scaring
me too much.

1701
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:36,290
The way he's eating
bunches of bananas,

1702
01:50:36,496 --> 01:50:38,760
l feel elephants will come
to petty shop for bananas.

1703
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:42,867
Baskar, tell the teacher to
take lesson, l'm feeling sleepy.

1704
01:50:43,169 --> 01:50:44,796
Take lesson before he sleeps.

1705
01:50:45,005 --> 01:50:47,235
How can l spend my energy
and knowledge on one student...

1706
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:48,737
You asked advance, right?

1707
01:50:49,209 --> 01:50:50,471
Take your advance.

1708
01:50:50,677 --> 01:50:52,702
Don't stand next to him for long,
he may eat you also.

1709
01:50:52,912 --> 01:50:53,879
Take lesson.

1710
01:50:54,347 --> 01:51:18,035


1711
01:51:18,905 --> 01:51:20,896
Listen carefully, have tea.

1712
01:51:24,277 --> 01:51:25,175
Singing!

1713
01:51:25,945 --> 01:51:27,970
No new admission today?

1714
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:31,173
- Ask the one to leave.
- No problem.

1715
01:51:31,384 --> 01:51:33,818
Today is first day,
we must progress gradually.

1716
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:36,420
Listen to our friendship song.

1717
01:51:41,261 --> 01:51:42,421
Hi Nallathambi!

1718
01:51:43,730 --> 01:51:44,856
Please come in, sit down.

1719
01:51:45,498 --> 01:51:48,365
lt seems they are distributing free
hot pongal in near by temple.

1720
01:51:48,601 --> 01:51:50,364
- What? Pongal?
- Yes, go quickly.

1721
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:53,130
Go down and have two teas
on Nallathambi's account.

1722
01:51:53,339 --> 01:51:54,067
What? Tea?

1723
01:51:54,274 --> 01:51:55,366
You please sit down.

1724
01:51:55,575 --> 01:51:57,099
Buddy, l forgot to tell you.

1725
01:51:57,310 --> 01:52:00,370
l got a call from you saloon, 20 people
are waiting to tonsure head, go.

1726
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:01,376
Go quickly.

1727
01:52:01,981 --> 01:52:04,142
Why are you sending out all of us?

1728
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:05,977
Buddy, my girl is here.

1729
01:52:06,186 --> 01:52:08,814
She may feel like talking
to me freely alone.

1730
01:52:09,022 --> 01:52:09,852
Can't say it, buddy.

1731
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:13,116
She may kiss me
to take it to next stage.

1732
01:52:13,326 --> 01:52:15,817
- Did we start tutorial for this?
- Try to understand me.

1733
01:52:16,029 --> 01:52:16,893
Leave quickly.

1734
01:52:17,097 --> 01:52:18,064
Come on darling.

1735
01:52:20,333 --> 01:52:22,392
What do you think of yourself?
Are you mad?

1736
01:52:22,602 --> 01:52:25,230
Did l say why l'm here?
Did l?

1737
01:52:26,005 --> 01:52:29,236
lf your hand touches me,
l'm warning you.

1738
01:52:29,542 --> 01:52:30,804
Why are you getting tensed, darling?

1739
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:34,571
Look, l don't want to talk to one
who didn't want to talk to me.

1740
01:52:34,781 --> 01:52:37,375
l'm here to see you,
l'm here to talk to you only.

1741
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:40,815
- ls it okay?
- Okay.

1742
01:52:41,221 --> 01:52:44,918
Just one staff, one student,

1743
01:52:45,125 --> 01:52:47,923
who are you teaching in
an empty class room?

1744
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:50,153
lsn't there a limit to your
duty consciousness?

1745
01:52:50,897 --> 01:52:54,594
l've forgotten to tell you, don't worry
about not getting students,

1746
01:52:54,801 --> 01:53:00,103
wait for 4 or 5 months,
face value of you both,

1747
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,164
crowds will throng here.

1748
01:53:03,143 --> 01:53:04,167
Okay, bye.

1749
01:53:07,113 --> 01:53:09,877
Buddy, what my girl says is right.

1750
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:11,607
Why shouldn't we wait
for 4 or 5 months?

1751
01:53:11,818 --> 01:53:13,513
Are we here for delivery?

1752
01:53:14,254 --> 01:53:15,551
Remove your cooling glasses.

1753
01:53:16,489 --> 01:53:21,051
She's taunting nobody will
come looking at our faces.

1754
01:53:21,928 --> 01:53:23,520
Can we say it like that also?

1755
01:53:24,831 --> 01:53:28,062
He's so dull not to
understand this also.

1756
01:53:28,268 --> 01:53:30,463
l've started this venture
trusting him.

1757
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:32,797
God save me.

1758
01:53:33,506 --> 01:53:56,523


1759
01:53:57,163 --> 01:53:58,790
My brother!

1760
01:53:59,532 --> 01:54:15,347


1761
01:54:15,882 --> 01:54:17,440
Boss, we are 30 students.

1762
01:54:17,650 --> 01:54:19,311
- 30 students?
- He's the gang leader.

1763
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:20,952
- Greetings brother.
- Greetings.

1764
01:54:21,154 --> 01:54:23,452
Let's start a petty shop
inside classroom,

1765
01:54:23,656 --> 01:54:26,022
we needn't have to go out
for cigarettes and betel nuts.

1766
01:54:26,226 --> 01:54:31,687
Have we started any wine shop
to have shops or eatery?

1767
01:54:31,898 --> 01:54:33,024
We can't do all that.

1768
01:54:33,233 --> 01:54:35,633
lf you fail we'll return the money.

1769
01:54:35,835 --> 01:54:37,427
Anyway you're going to
repay our money,

1770
01:54:37,637 --> 01:54:40,800
it'll be helpful to us if you start
giving Rs.100 every day.

1771
01:54:41,007 --> 01:54:42,770
- What do you say, buddy?
- Right, pal!

1772
01:54:43,142 --> 01:54:43,767
Think over it, Boss.

1773
01:54:43,977 --> 01:54:46,775
lt's not in this scheme,
l'll think of adding it next time.

1774
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:50,607
You go now and get those
30 jail birds released, Go!

1775
01:54:51,451 --> 01:54:54,784
Crowds are thronging,
shall we pay advance income tax?

1776
01:54:54,988 --> 01:54:57,548
First let's pay Pal Pandi's tax.

1777
01:54:57,690 --> 01:55:01,285
lf we fail in exam, will you
repay in cash or cheque?

1778
01:55:02,328 --> 01:55:04,796
Come to class with the
hope of passing.

1779
01:55:04,998 --> 01:55:06,932
Your aim looks like to fail
and get back your money.

1780
01:55:07,133 --> 01:55:08,964
Don't you've any responsibility?

1781
01:55:09,435 --> 01:55:19,401
AYNGARAN DVD

1782
01:55:21,481 --> 01:55:23,210
l can't do it anymore.

1783
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:26,249
Dear students,
because of short time,

1784
01:55:26,352 --> 01:55:28,616
- shall we go straight to the lesson?
- Sir!

1785
01:55:28,688 --> 01:55:30,986
Doubt before taking the lesson?

1786
01:55:31,257 --> 01:55:33,487
No need to take any lesson,
just shut up and leave the class.

1787
01:55:33,693 --> 01:55:34,682
What's this?

1788
01:55:34,894 --> 01:55:37,328
Don't beat me, l'm your teacher.

1789
01:55:38,665 --> 01:55:39,495
Don't beat me.

1790
01:55:40,466 --> 01:55:44,800
Leave me...leave me...
Don't chase me...

1791
01:55:45,004 --> 01:55:46,801
Stop...stop...where are you
going cutting the class?

1792
01:55:47,006 --> 01:55:48,439
Do you know what will happen
if Gopal sir knows it?

1793
01:55:48,641 --> 01:55:49,938
l'm Gopal!

1794
01:55:50,143 --> 01:55:54,944
You went in like new note book but
coming out like old torn book.

1795
01:55:55,148 --> 01:55:55,773
Are they boys?

1796
01:55:55,982 --> 01:55:58,780
lnstead of teaching them,
it's better to beg on streets.

1797
01:55:58,985 --> 01:56:01,283
- Sir...sir...
- Buddy!

1798
01:56:01,821 --> 01:56:02,685
ls it him?

1799
01:56:05,758 --> 01:56:08,158
You gave teas and rapped
on my head, right?

1800
01:56:08,361 --> 01:56:09,623
Even if God thinks,

1801
01:56:09,829 --> 01:56:12,525
nobody can stop you
from cleaning dung.

1802
01:56:13,166 --> 01:56:14,190
Shall l go now?

1803
01:56:14,767 --> 01:56:18,225
Even piglet is delivering
punch dialogue!

1804
01:56:18,438 --> 01:56:21,532
Don't feel, buddy.
Let's do something.

1805
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:29,238
You said let's do something
and walking like a guard.

1806
01:56:29,449 --> 01:56:33,579
l'm thinking seriously in which way
to embark our successful journey.

1807
01:56:33,786 --> 01:56:38,155
Bloody! Taking loan on interest,
he's still thinking of routes..

1808
01:56:40,126 --> 01:56:41,718
Hello...hello...

1809
01:56:43,262 --> 01:56:45,730
Buddy, missed call from your sister.

1810
01:56:46,165 --> 01:56:48,326
My girl friend.
Buddy, l've a doubt.

1811
01:56:48,534 --> 01:56:51,765
Why do girls always give
missed calls?

1812
01:56:51,971 --> 01:56:54,462
Do you need such doubts
with neck deep problems?

1813
01:56:54,674 --> 01:56:56,335
Please tell me, why do they
always give missed calls?

1814
01:56:56,542 --> 01:57:00,569
lt's not missed calls but danger
signals of ditching in near future.

1815
01:57:01,180 --> 01:57:03,148
Your girl to will ditch you
in near future.

1816
01:57:03,349 --> 01:57:04,509
You're jealous.

1817
01:57:08,054 --> 01:57:10,147
- Chandrika!
- Nallathambi brother!

1818
01:57:10,323 --> 01:57:13,588
Hello, l'm in an important meeting,
l'll call you later.

1819
01:57:15,962 --> 01:57:18,260
lf she gives missed call to you,
you call her back,

1820
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:20,022
if not she's calling me.

1821
01:57:20,233 --> 01:57:23,600
Buddy, if one can't get a busy
businessman's line,

1822
01:57:23,803 --> 01:57:25,532
it's obvious that his assistant
will get the call next.

1823
01:57:25,738 --> 01:57:26,363
That's a rule.

1824
01:57:26,572 --> 01:57:28,267
- She's calling to taunt...
- Hi Nallathambi.

1825
01:57:29,242 --> 01:57:31,506
You said you're in meeting,
l knew it.

1826
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:34,373
You will be with English professor.

1827
01:57:35,314 --> 01:57:38,340
lt seems you're 'Challenge' Nallathambi
from today.

1828
01:57:38,551 --> 01:57:39,279
ls it?

1829
01:57:41,521 --> 01:57:42,954
l'll call you like that only from now.

1830
01:57:43,756 --> 01:57:46,884
l saw the posters, super, no chance.

1831
01:57:48,795 --> 01:57:50,888
lt seems heavy rush
in tutorial centre,

1832
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:53,457
infact there was traffic jam also here.

1833
01:57:53,666 --> 01:57:55,395
lt seems the queue is
extending till Thanjavur.

1834
01:57:56,069 --> 01:57:57,559
Congratulations.

1835
01:57:59,272 --> 01:58:02,173
- Congratulations Nallathambi.
- Thank you.

1836
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:03,740
Okay, l'll take leave.

1837
01:58:06,446 --> 01:58:07,538
Ambani brothers!

1838
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:11,274
lt seems you owe Rs.107 and
paise 50 to the tea shop,

1839
01:58:11,484 --> 01:58:12,781
Rs.107.50?

1840
01:58:12,985 --> 01:58:13,917
lt must be Rs.1 10, right?

1841
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:16,748
Nair said when l was coming up,

1842
01:58:16,956 --> 01:58:18,389
if you don't pay him by evening,

1843
01:58:18,591 --> 01:58:20,320
it seems he'll throw hot water
on your face,

1844
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,694
anyway go carefully when you leave.

1845
01:58:22,895 --> 01:58:24,260
Okay Nallathambi, bye.

1846
01:58:26,099 --> 01:58:28,829
- Nallathambi, l'm telling you, bye.
- Go...go...

1847
01:58:29,035 --> 01:58:30,195
Nallathambi, l'm telling you, bye.

1848
01:58:30,403 --> 01:58:31,995
Hey, look at her.

1849
01:58:33,706 --> 01:58:34,832
You could've done that earlier.

1850
01:58:38,277 --> 01:58:41,440
People with tens of friends
are happy.

1851
01:58:41,647 --> 01:58:45,014
With just one friend,
the hell l'm going through is...

1852
01:58:46,986 --> 01:58:48,954
- You're my friend!
- Take off your hands.

1853
01:58:49,455 --> 01:58:52,515
Earlier Asin used to come
in my dream,

1854
01:58:52,725 --> 01:58:56,286
now Pal Pandi and his father
Vel Pandi come to scare me.

1855
01:58:56,496 --> 01:58:59,363
Moreover promise to return
money if they fail!

1856
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:02,828
You've made me a debtor
to so many here.

1857
01:59:03,035 --> 01:59:04,900
Buddy, don't talk negatively.

1858
01:59:05,104 --> 01:59:06,799
Shall l make a print and
speak like photo?

1859
01:59:07,006 --> 01:59:08,530
No comedy please.

1860
01:59:08,741 --> 01:59:12,268
We didn't have anything,
now we are running a tutorial,

1861
01:59:12,478 --> 01:59:14,969
first nobody came,
now we've many students,

1862
01:59:15,181 --> 01:59:16,307
nobody studies now,

1863
01:59:16,516 --> 01:59:18,916
but hereafter they will study
and pass the exam.

1864
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:21,552
Failures are stepping stone
to grand success.

1865
01:59:21,754 --> 01:59:24,052
Nallathambi, we must work like fire.

1866
01:59:25,324 --> 01:59:27,656
When it comes to work,
l'm like the white man,

1867
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:32,388

01:59:32,865 --> 01:59:47,838


1869
01:59:48,314 --> 01:59:48,803
Hello!

1870
01:59:48,981 --> 01:59:52,542
You said you'll make students
to freeze in tutorial.

1871
01:59:52,652 --> 01:59:54,620
All are standing outside
and scratching.

1872
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:57,188
- Where are you?
- Boss, look this side.

1873
01:59:57,890 --> 02:00:30,919


1874
02:00:32,024 --> 02:00:32,649
Buddy!

1875
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,654
Why did you bring her here?

1876
02:00:38,497 --> 02:00:41,295
- She's new teacher!
- Teacher?

1877
02:00:43,202 --> 02:00:46,000

02:00:54,213 --> 02:00:56,841
Buddy, very good teacher.
Who is she?

1880
02:00:57,216 --> 02:00:58,012
Don't you know her?

1881
02:00:58,217 --> 02:01:00,185
- She very famous for bits.
- Bit?

1882
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:03,687
No boy can copy from bit
in the school she teaches.

1883
02:01:03,889 --> 02:01:05,516
She'll catch them.

1884
02:01:06,292 --> 02:01:09,455
Look, how the boys are sitting
freezed on the benches.

1885
02:01:11,464 --> 02:01:14,695
Hi students!

Why are you boys standing?
Please sit down.

1888
02:01:33,719 --> 02:01:34,981
Your legs may pain.

1889
02:01:35,187 --> 02:01:38,452
lf we sit, we can't see properly,
boys in front are obstructing view.

1890
02:01:38,658 --> 02:01:39,647
Yes teacher!

1891
02:01:39,859 --> 02:01:41,326
How interested you're to study!

1892
02:01:41,527 --> 02:01:44,223
Students must be like you.

1893
02:01:44,664 --> 02:01:56,303


1894
02:01:56,709 --> 02:01:59,143
Careful, you may get hurt and bleed.

1895
02:01:59,345 --> 02:02:00,676
- Take it teacher.
- Thank you.

1896
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:03,713
l'll feel proud to shed blood
for you, teacher.

1897
02:02:03,916 --> 02:02:05,747
Go to your seats.

1898
02:02:07,953 --> 02:02:09,079
Missed the chance.

1899
02:02:09,288 --> 02:02:14,851
Buddy! Did you see?
Pin drop silence!

1900
02:02:15,061 --> 02:02:16,585
So silent they are.

1901
02:02:17,563 --> 02:02:19,224
Buddy, super!

1902
02:02:19,432 --> 02:02:22,595
You've proved you're
well experienced.

1903
02:02:22,802 --> 02:02:24,326
l would've done it much earlier,

1904
02:02:24,537 --> 02:02:28,268
you've to develop,
so l left it for you to learn,

1905
02:02:28,474 --> 02:02:30,203
life is nothing but experience.

1906
02:02:30,409 --> 02:02:33,276
l've much to learn from you.

1907
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:35,707
- Please teach me.
- Keep quiet man.

1908
02:02:36,916 --> 02:02:38,577

What did you do now?

1910
02:02:40,119 --> 02:02:42,553
- Buddy, this is gesture of victory.
- Gesture of victory?

1911
02:02:45,691 --> 02:02:47,716
lf l make this gesture,

1912
02:02:47,927 --> 02:02:50,623
it means my shop is saved,
my family is saved,

1913
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:51,387
why did you do it?

1914
02:02:51,597 --> 02:02:54,191
My sister will get married,
l'll get married.

1915
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,992
ls it like that?

1916
02:02:56,202 --> 02:02:58,636
Shall we both do it together?

1917
02:02:59,772 --> 02:03:01,637
Yes...yes!

1918
02:03:02,675 --> 02:03:05,143
l think class is over, let's go in.

1919
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:08,142
Today's class is over,
let's meet tomorrow, Bye.

1920
02:03:09,281 --> 02:03:11,806
Teacher...teacher...

1921
02:03:12,418 --> 02:03:13,578
How are the students?

1922
02:03:13,786 --> 02:03:17,278
Nallathambi, don't worry.
Students are very good boys.

1923
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:18,582
Just like you.

1924
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:20,486
- Buddy, for me too.
- Teacher, for him too.

1925
02:03:21,594 --> 02:03:25,394
l'm sure every student will pass.
Bye.

1926
02:03:25,598 --> 02:03:26,656
Okay, bye teacher.

1927

Look at the boys!

02:03:32,705 --> 02:03:35,833
They are freezed like ice.

1930
02:03:36,208 --> 02:03:37,607
You've achieved it.

1931
02:03:39,145 --> 02:03:42,774
My dear students!
lndia's future!

1932
02:03:42,982 --> 02:03:44,950
Have you understood
the maths lesson?

1933
02:03:45,151 --> 02:03:49,019
Pal Pandi sir, did the Maths
teacher taught you well?

1934
02:03:50,055 --> 02:03:53,684
ls she maths teacher?
You never told me.

1935
02:04:02,334 --> 02:04:04,063
Buddy, your sister is here.

1936
02:04:04,270 --> 02:04:07,034
Watch now, she'll talk to me
using you as proxy.

1937
02:04:09,742 --> 02:04:12,040
Still haven't you closed down it?

1938
02:04:12,745 --> 02:04:17,978
Will you be here till Vel Pandi's men
bring it down and throw you out?

1939
02:04:18,818 --> 02:04:20,979
Do you still have hope
on this tutorial?

1940
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:24,489
Aren't you a family man?
Do your work.

1941
02:04:26,192 --> 02:04:27,659
Buddy! Be careful, you may fall...

1942
02:04:32,097 --> 02:04:34,156
- l want to tell an important thing.
- What?

1943
02:04:34,366 --> 02:04:36,596
- ls your marriage fixed?
- No.

1944
02:04:36,802 --> 02:04:38,064
Let's marry.

1945
02:04:39,038 --> 02:04:40,733
l've waited patiently for long time,

1946
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:43,570
you advertise to return
money if they fail,

1947
02:04:43,776 --> 02:04:46,574
you bring as teacher some lady
and have fun here,

1948
02:04:47,213 --> 02:04:51,741
l don't think you'll earn money,
arrange your sister's marriage,

1949
02:04:51,951 --> 02:04:53,248
and come seeking
my hand in marriage,

1950
02:04:53,853 --> 02:04:55,821
l'm getting tired saying all this,

1951
02:04:56,021 --> 02:04:58,080
forget all that,
l'm not here to talk about that,

1952
02:04:58,591 --> 02:05:00,286
my job will get confirmed
next month,

1953
02:05:00,493 --> 02:05:05,328
l'll get Rs.15000 salary a month,
as you expect, l'll take care of you.

1954
02:05:05,531 --> 02:05:08,091
l don't care about my people
or your people.

1955
02:05:09,335 --> 02:05:11,098
Tell me your decision by tomorrow.

1956
02:05:19,378 --> 02:05:21,710
What are you doing?
Vacating the shop?

1957
02:05:22,081 --> 02:05:23,548
You've made me vacate it.

1958
02:05:23,749 --> 02:05:25,376
Before Vel Pandi takes
over the shop,

1959
02:05:25,584 --> 02:05:27,882
l'll put up a shop under some
tree and earn my livelihood.

1960
02:05:28,087 --> 02:05:30,385
Are you vacating the shop
listening to a girl's words?

1961
02:05:30,589 --> 02:05:31,715
Don't you've trust on me?

1962
02:05:31,924 --> 02:05:33,789
To become an intern son-in-law,

1963
02:05:33,993 --> 02:05:35,824
you've made me an intern
son-in-law go to streets.

1964
02:05:36,028 --> 02:05:39,987
Enough of becoming Ambani
by joining you to do business.

1965
02:05:40,199 --> 02:05:43,566
- Leave me alone.
- Listen to me. Lets do something.

1966
02:05:43,769 --> 02:05:47,000
Best wishes, Thala Thalapathy!
Looks like you're shifting to big place.

1967
02:05:47,206 --> 02:05:48,070
Won't you come back here?

1968
02:05:48,274 --> 02:05:50,003
lf you die, l'll come to
tonsure your son's head.

1969
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:52,905
- Why are you getting tensed?
- Okay, l'll not get tensed.

1970
02:05:53,112 --> 02:05:54,841
l'm telling coolly,
l don't want anything of you.

1971
02:05:55,047 --> 02:05:55,570
Leave me alone.

1972
02:05:55,781 --> 02:05:57,578
l'll go....l'll go...
l'll go somewhere...

1973
02:05:57,783 --> 02:05:58,807
Then, give me the key.

1974
02:05:59,418 --> 02:06:01,249
l'm vacating the shop,
why do you want the key?

1975
02:06:01,453 --> 02:06:02,920
My things are here.

1976
02:06:03,122 --> 02:06:06,751
Things? Diamonds and gems!
Old torn briefs.

1977
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:08,591
Go...go away...take that.

1978
02:06:10,429 --> 02:06:33,446


1979
02:06:34,253 --> 02:06:35,811
Do you've any sense?

1980
02:06:36,188 --> 02:06:39,988
They are insulting people like us
by throwing rotten tomatoes.

1981
02:06:40,192 --> 02:06:41,159
And she is...

1982
02:06:42,127 --> 02:06:44,755
l can't even imagine it.
Send her away.

1983
02:06:46,498 --> 02:06:47,487
Teacher, you come.

1984
02:06:49,201 --> 02:06:51,726
Poor woman may not know
if boys do anything.

1985
02:06:51,937 --> 02:06:53,495
We've committed many
mistakes unwittingly,

1986
02:06:53,706 --> 02:06:55,230
please don't do a mistake
knowing it well,

1987
02:06:55,441 --> 02:06:56,499

1988
02:06:56,875 --> 02:06:58,502
please don't embarrass her,
please send her away.

1989
02:06:58,711 --> 02:07:01,179
Leave me, l'll take care.
Teacher, you come.

1990
02:07:02,114 --> 02:07:06,312
Boys! She's Annapoorani.
She's your class teacher from today.

1991
02:07:06,585 --> 02:07:11,852
We don't want this teacher, Boss.
- We want Parimala teacher. - Yes.

1992
02:07:11,991 --> 02:07:13,015
One minute...

1993
02:07:13,292 --> 02:07:16,693
Whether you like it or not,
she's your teacher.

1994
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:22,867
Are you done?

1995
02:07:23,569 --> 02:07:25,196
Teacher, the class is yours now.

1996
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:26,798
Baskar, one minute.

1997
02:07:27,272 --> 02:07:29,035
Though you know l'm visually impaired,

1998
02:07:29,241 --> 02:07:31,801
you've confidence in me and
gave me this opportunity,

1999
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:34,707

2000
02:07:35,347 --> 02:07:52,356


2001
02:07:53,265 --> 02:07:57,167
Though l can't see, l've done M.Sc.,
and M.phil., to teach you.

2002
02:07:57,369 --> 02:07:59,837
passing tenth class is
not a big deal.

2003
02:08:00,039 --> 02:08:01,063
Just think about it.

2004
02:08:08,347 --> 02:08:11,510
l've seen more mischievous
acts than this.

2005
02:08:11,717 --> 02:08:15,244
No matter whatever you do,
l'll not stop taking class.

2006
02:08:15,788 --> 02:08:19,349
After l teach you,
even if one student passes,

l'll be as happy as
l've got back my vision.

2008
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:23,518
Okay? Good luck.

2009
02:08:44,917 --> 02:08:47,442
Please sit in the class, boys.

2010
02:08:47,653 --> 02:08:53,114
Poor woman is teaching,

02:08:59,531 --> 02:09:03,126
Students, nothing urgent.
Copy is patiently.

02:09:03,335 --> 02:09:05,803
Maths isn't as tough as you think.

Have you understood the
maths problem l've solved?

2014

Please take it down.

2015

Density of round is Pi R2 H.

02:09:12,845 --> 02:09:16,440
lf you by heart this formula,
you can solve this problem easily.

Are you my friend?

2176
02:22:39,083 --> 02:22:39,811
Okay father.

2177
02:22:40,018 --> 02:22:43,044
lnfact l came to talk to you
about Chandrika's marriage.

2178
02:22:43,254 --> 02:22:45,017
- Tell me dear.
- You started it yourself.

2179
02:22:46,491 --> 02:22:50,450
Father, how about giving Chandrika
in marriage to Baskar...

2180
02:22:53,298 --> 02:22:54,788
Please tell me something else.

2181
02:22:55,900 --> 02:22:58,630
Father, Baskar isn't like earlier.

2182
02:22:58,970 --> 02:23:00,460
- He has...
- l know.

2183
02:23:01,673 --> 02:23:03,038
l've promised him, father.

2184
02:23:03,241 --> 02:23:05,368
Who are you to promise
about my daughter?

2185
02:23:10,348 --> 02:23:12,646
There's lot of work here, go.

2186
02:23:13,351 --> 02:23:14,648
Why are you talking
like this, father?

2187
02:23:15,219 --> 02:23:17,983
Chandrika is my sister,
am l not concerned about her?

2188
02:23:18,289 --> 02:23:20,154
Am l asking you to marry her
to some stranger?

2189
02:23:20,358 --> 02:23:23,486
l'm saying Baskar is doing well,
she'll be fine with him.

2190
02:23:23,695 --> 02:23:24,992
Why are you so harsh, father?

2191
02:23:25,363 --> 02:23:27,331
What's the fight between
father and daughter?

2192
02:23:28,199 --> 02:23:31,999
Not any fight, son-in-law.
She's talking nonsense.

2193
02:23:32,203 --> 02:23:33,670
Doesn't have any sense.

2194
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:35,338
What did you tell him?

2195
02:23:36,441 --> 02:23:37,373
What did she say, father-in-law?

2196
02:23:37,575 --> 02:23:41,375
lt seems l must give Chandrika in
marriage to that useless Baskar.

2197
02:23:41,579 --> 02:23:45,174
How can l accept a man who
doesn't have any qualification?

2198
02:23:45,383 --> 02:23:46,350
You tell me, son-in-law.

2199
02:23:46,551 --> 02:23:48,018
What's the problem between
you and Baskar?

2200
02:23:48,219 --> 02:23:49,686
Really l don't know what's the
problem between you both?

2201
02:23:50,021 --> 02:23:53,115
You're always chiding him.
What does he lack?

2202
02:23:53,324 --> 02:23:55,189
He has started a tutorial, if you get
your daughter married to him,

2203
02:23:55,393 --> 02:23:56,257
he'll take good care of her,

2204
02:23:56,461 --> 02:23:57,519
what else do you expect from him?

2205
02:23:57,729 --> 02:24:00,129
What happened to you?
ls it the way to talk to an elder?

2206
02:24:00,331 --> 02:24:03,198
ls he talking like an elder?
What does our Baskar lack?

2207
02:24:03,401 --> 02:24:04,959
lt seems he'll not get his
daughter married to him.

2208
02:24:05,169 --> 02:24:06,193
You keep quiet.

2209
02:24:06,571 --> 02:24:09,438
Kinsman, l wanted to ask this myself,

2210
02:24:09,641 --> 02:24:12,109
- Baskar...
- l hate your son Baskar.

2211
02:24:12,310 --> 02:24:12,776
ls it enough?

2212
02:24:12,977 --> 02:24:14,535
This marriage wouldn't have
happened without Baskar,

2213
02:24:14,746 --> 02:24:15,542
do you know that?

2214
02:24:16,481 --> 02:24:20,645
This is the only good thing he has
done wittingly or unwittingly.

2215
02:24:20,852 --> 02:24:23,218
Otherwise his character
is very worst.

2216
02:24:23,421 --> 02:24:24,649
Why are you saying like this?

2217
02:24:24,889 --> 02:24:28,222
l've been seeing you,
what do you know about Baskar?

2218
02:24:28,526 --> 02:24:29,891
l've never raised him like that.

2219
02:24:30,094 --> 02:24:33,325
What has he done that you
always find fault with him?

2220
02:24:33,531 --> 02:24:35,055
l must know it. Tell me.

2221
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:38,569
Please don't incite me.
l'm warning you.

2222
02:24:38,770 --> 02:24:40,169
Then, something has happened,

2223
02:24:40,371 --> 02:24:42,236
- whatever it is, please tell us, father.
- Tell me sir.

2224
02:24:42,674 --> 02:24:44,403
Aren't they asking you?
Please tell them.

2225
02:24:44,609 --> 02:24:45,507
Tell me, father.

2226
02:24:58,623 --> 02:25:00,648
Why should l be felicitated?

2227
02:25:03,895 --> 02:25:05,419
What have l done to deserve it?

2228
02:25:06,030 --> 02:25:07,657
l'm asking you, what have l done?

2229
02:25:08,099 --> 02:25:09,657
l just did my duty.

2230
02:25:10,735 --> 02:25:12,100
Why should l be felicitated for it?

2231
02:25:12,303 --> 02:25:17,935
l've helped thousands of people
in Kumbakonam.

2232
02:25:18,142 --> 02:25:20,770
There are many who have benefited
because of me,

2233
02:25:20,978 --> 02:25:26,211
nobody here has lost because of me
not a man can point a finger at me.

2234
02:25:26,417 --> 02:25:28,612
ls there anyone here?
lf there's anyone, come out bravely.

2235
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:29,946
Please come out sir.

2236
02:25:30,254 --> 02:25:33,121
- Come out!
- l..l'm there!

2237
02:25:33,324 --> 02:25:35,451
- ls it him?
- Greetings...greetings.

2238
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:37,457
Why did he come here?

2239
02:25:38,329 --> 02:25:40,854
lt's funny to hear him.

2240
02:25:41,833 --> 02:25:44,529
Come here and pour out your heart.

2241
02:25:44,736 --> 02:25:46,533
Come and share your opinion.

2242
02:25:46,738 --> 02:25:48,296
Come on...come.

2243
02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:50,705
Nice to meet you.

2244
02:25:51,309 --> 02:25:53,368
Greetings sir.
Greetings madam.

2245
02:25:56,748 --> 02:26:04,052
Making loan seekers go
from pillar to post, Mister...

2246
02:26:04,956 --> 02:26:06,548
Please move your tummy.

2247
02:26:06,758 --> 02:26:10,387
Greetings to Shanmugasundaram.

2248
02:26:11,429 --> 02:26:16,560
Sir said he doesn't like
such felicitations.

2249
02:26:16,768 --> 02:26:20,329
Then, why the hell did you come here?

2250
02:26:22,774 --> 02:26:27,177
l'll cut your face, sit down...

2251
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:32,580
The ladies and gentlemen,
please sit down.

2252
02:26:34,552 --> 02:26:37,214
Sit down..sit down...
l've seen much worse goons.

2253
02:26:37,421 --> 02:26:39,548
Dear, come here.

2254
02:26:39,757 --> 02:26:42,089
Come here, dear.
Come and stand here.

2255
02:26:43,027 --> 02:26:46,963
What's this bushy dog like
hairstyle in this old age?

2256
02:26:47,165 --> 02:26:47,927
Style?

2257
02:26:48,399 --> 02:26:52,199
Funk hairstyle at the age of
becoming a grandfather.

2258
02:26:52,403 --> 02:26:54,371
l'll cut it.

2259
02:26:54,639 --> 02:26:59,838
When my friend came seeking loan,
what should have been your response?

2260
02:27:00,044 --> 02:27:01,272
What you should've told him, dear?

2261
02:27:01,479 --> 02:27:04,346
You should've said, l'll sanction,
or should've said, l'll not sanction.

2262
02:27:04,549 --> 02:27:08,713
Feeling as if you're giving the
loan from your own pocket,

2263
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:10,785
you humiliated and sent him out.

2264
02:27:11,088 --> 02:27:13,955
Are you so great?

2265
02:27:14,225 --> 02:27:16,819
l'm asking you,
are you really so great?

2266
02:27:17,028 --> 02:27:21,727
ln a small cabin,
with just one rolling chair,

2267
02:27:21,933 --> 02:27:26,302
if you've so much proud
working there,

2268
02:27:26,504 --> 02:27:30,304
with four rolling chairs in my shop,

2269
02:27:30,508 --> 02:27:34,239
l'm cutting hair going around,
how proud should we be?

2270
02:27:34,445 --> 02:27:36,345
How proud should we be?

2271
02:27:36,547 --> 02:27:38,071
Wait, just a minute.

2272
02:27:38,282 --> 02:27:40,011
Look how he's blabbering
under influence of liquor.

2273
02:27:40,218 --> 02:27:44,086
- Hello buddy! Be on line.
- Tell me buddy.

2274
02:27:44,288 --> 02:27:45,084
Tell me quickly, buddy.

2275
02:27:45,289 --> 02:27:48,816
Buddy, how do you abuse
your girl's father?

2276
02:27:49,026 --> 02:27:51,187
- Who? That mongoose head?
- Yes, that man only.

2277
02:27:51,395 --> 02:27:52,760
Buddy, he's a mad man.

2278
02:27:52,997 --> 02:27:56,626
Pain in the neck, nuisance, nasty,
bothersome, annoying, rotten man.

2279
02:27:56,801 --> 02:27:58,598
Leave it, buddy, l'm not
in mood to abuse him.

2280
02:27:58,803 --> 02:28:00,668
Sorry buddy for disturbing you.

2281
02:28:00,872 --> 02:28:01,839
Did you hear it?

2282
02:28:02,206 --> 02:28:05,175
Do you know who is he?
Your younger son-in-law!

2283
02:28:05,376 --> 02:28:07,037
lt seems he's not in mood
to abuse you,

2284
02:28:07,245 --> 02:28:08,405
but still he was so nasty,

2285
02:28:08,613 --> 02:28:12,105
if he was in mood, he would've
used choicest epithets.

2286
02:28:12,483 --> 02:28:15,782
Sundaram, behave properly
not to hurt Baskar.

2287
02:28:15,987 --> 02:28:18,182
- Look, how he's insulting him.
- lf l get any report on you again...

2288
02:28:25,229 --> 02:28:27,789
l've a small pending job.
l'll finish it.

2289
02:28:34,572 --> 02:28:35,732
l didn't do anything.

2290
02:28:37,875 --> 02:28:39,206
- Please come here.
- No problem.

2291
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:41,640
No, come here sir...come.

2292
02:28:45,616 --> 02:28:49,177
You had insulted me,
engaging a man to insult me.

2293
02:28:49,387 --> 02:28:50,979
Should l give my daughter
in marriage to him?

2294
02:28:51,522 --> 02:28:52,750
Tell me, son-in-law.

2295
02:28:54,759 --> 02:28:58,718
Will you give your daughter to anyone
spits on hand and slaps you?

2296
02:28:58,930 --> 02:29:00,727
Answer me sir,
why are you standing silently?

2297
02:29:00,932 --> 02:29:01,830
He has seen me.

2298
02:29:02,633 --> 02:29:13,601


2299
02:29:14,245 --> 02:29:15,177
Do you know now,

2300
02:29:15,379 --> 02:29:19,247
Baskar is running after his
friend Nallathambi to kill him.

2301
02:29:19,450 --> 02:29:21,941
The reason for it is
the wedge he had inserted.

2302
02:29:33,230 --> 02:29:36,529
You claimed as my friend and
put a wedge between us.

2303
02:29:36,734 --> 02:29:38,361
Are you a friend?

2304
02:29:39,503 --> 02:29:41,471
lf you get drunk, sleep like a log.

2305
02:29:41,672 --> 02:29:43,537
Why are you still alive?
l'll kill...

2306
02:29:47,511 --> 02:29:48,409
Yes, tell me.

2307
02:29:48,879 --> 02:29:52,645
My father is talking about my
marriage with his friend's son.

2308
02:29:53,818 --> 02:29:56,981
Groom is coming here now
to meet me.

2309
02:29:57,188 --> 02:29:58,951
- ls he coming there?
- ls it over?

2310
02:29:59,156 --> 02:30:02,319

marriage immediately.

2311
02:30:03,194 --> 02:30:04,718
l'm scared.

2312
02:30:04,929 --> 02:30:06,658
Where are you now?
Come immediately.

2313
02:30:07,164 --> 02:30:09,223
Are you happy now?
Everything is over.

2314
02:30:09,433 --> 02:30:10,900
My anger will ease only
after killing you.

2315
02:30:11,602 --> 02:30:13,968
- l'll take you to task later.
- Buddy, one minute.

2316
02:30:14,171 --> 02:30:16,002
- Please beat me and go.

- Beat me...beat me...

2318
02:30:21,779 --> 02:30:23,940
Buddy, please beat me and go.

2319
02:30:24,148 --> 02:30:26,412
lf not people will talk bad
about our friendship.

2320
02:30:26,617 --> 02:30:27,914
Please listen to me.

2321

AYNGARAN DVD

2322
02:30:40,898 --> 02:30:42,422
What's this buddy?

2323
02:30:42,633 --> 02:30:45,932
He has come in a big car
wearing suit.

2324
02:30:49,140 --> 02:30:52,439
lt's over for me, buddy.
l'm wedged.

2325
02:30:59,250 --> 02:31:01,775
Hello..hi! l'm almost inside.

2326
02:31:01,986 --> 02:31:02,816
Hey guys! Nice hairstyle.

2327
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:04,009
Will you please tell me
where is Mr. Shanmugasundaram?

2328
02:31:04,221 --> 02:31:05,950
Shall we guide him to some other hall?

2329
02:31:06,357 --> 02:31:07,221
Welcome.

2330
02:31:07,425 --> 02:31:08,892
Sorry, l just got little held up
with the traffic.

2331
02:31:09,093 --> 02:31:12,358
No problem, in lndia traffic jam
is very very common.

2332
02:31:12,563 --> 02:31:13,495
Yeah, it's true,
am l late or something?

2333
02:31:13,697 --> 02:31:14,254
Not at all.

2334
02:31:14,465 --> 02:31:16,296
From morning we were expecting you.

2335
02:31:17,401 --> 02:31:19,028
What's this?
He's speaking English so well.

2336
02:31:19,236 --> 02:31:20,703
How can l?

2337
02:31:20,905 --> 02:31:23,567
Even the maid servant in Anglo lndian
family can speak English.

2338
02:31:23,774 --> 02:31:26,072
They speak raw without grammar.

2339
02:31:26,277 --> 02:31:28,040
- Shall l speak like that?
- Shut up!

2340
02:31:28,245 --> 02:31:30,611
l told you about Siva, he's Siva.

2341
02:31:30,815 --> 02:31:31,975
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

2342
02:31:32,817 --> 02:31:33,579
Hello.

2343
02:31:34,051 --> 02:31:37,316
She's my daughter Chandrika.
Very pretty girl.

2344
02:31:38,089 --> 02:31:39,579
- Hi!
- Hello.

2345
02:31:40,391 --> 02:31:42,086
l saw your photo in mail.

2346
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:45,320
You're more beautiful than in photo.

2347
02:31:45,763 --> 02:31:46,957
Look what's he up to?

2348
02:31:47,164 --> 02:31:49,132
Don't worry, he'll not succeed.

2349
02:31:49,333 --> 02:31:51,267
l want to talk to you a lot.

2350
02:31:52,036 --> 02:31:53,833
Anyway we'll talk a lot
after marriage, right?

2351
02:31:54,205 --> 02:31:55,763
Uncle, l like your daughter
very much.

2352
02:31:55,973 --> 02:31:56,962
About the rituals,
you can just talk to my daddy.

2353
02:31:57,174 --> 02:31:57,697
Okay...okay...

2354
02:31:57,908 --> 02:31:58,932
Anyways, adios..

2355
02:31:59,143 --> 02:32:00,167
Please wait, son-in-law.

2356
02:32:00,478 --> 02:32:03,970
Siva is my close friend's only son.

2357
02:32:04,181 --> 02:32:06,012
MD of Siva Granites.

2358
02:32:06,283 --> 02:32:08,683
What? MD?

2359
02:32:09,086 --> 02:32:12,852
To tell about him, he's a teetotaler.

2360
02:32:13,624 --> 02:32:16,354
Why are you startled?
Didn't get it?

2361
02:32:16,994 --> 02:32:21,897
Teetotaler means a honest man
without any bad habits

2362
02:32:22,099 --> 02:32:23,327
He's gem of a man.

2363
02:32:23,534 --> 02:32:25,092
Uncle! What's this?
You're embarrassing me.

2364
02:32:25,302 --> 02:32:27,236
- How can l not tell the truth?
- lt's too much for me to take it.

2365
02:32:27,438 --> 02:32:28,427
- Bye..bye...
- Okay.

2366
02:32:28,639 --> 02:32:29,367
Bye.

2367
02:32:31,742 --> 02:32:33,209
- Bye.
- Bye.

2368
02:32:34,378 --> 02:32:37,711
- Uncle, l'm pretty impressed
with your daughter.- Okay.

2369
02:32:37,915 --> 02:32:41,544
Buddy, he's coming, take him
alone and tell him everything.

2370
02:32:42,019 --> 02:32:43,281
Son-in-law, how is your
business going?

2371
02:32:43,487 --> 02:32:45,148
- One minute.
- Absolutely fine as l told you.

2372
02:32:45,356 --> 02:32:47,984
- Don't talk to useless guys.
- You please keep quiet.

2373
02:32:48,192 --> 02:32:49,181
You talk to him.

2374
02:32:49,393 --> 02:32:50,382
Tell me.

2375
02:32:51,028 --> 02:32:52,393
About Chandrika's marriage.

2376
02:32:54,231 --> 02:32:55,664
- l want to talk to you personally.
- Go ahead.

2377
02:32:55,866 --> 02:32:56,890
- What's this?
- Tell it's with him.

2378
02:32:57,101 --> 02:32:59,899
Hello, l must talk to you alone.

2379
02:33:00,838 --> 02:33:02,738
Son-in-law, your flight is
getting delayed.

2380
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:05,340
There's no airport in Kumbakonam.
You go after talking to him.

2381
02:33:09,847 --> 02:33:12,509
- l and Chandrika...
- Love each other?

2382
02:33:13,284 --> 02:33:14,751
One side or double side?

2383
02:33:15,452 --> 02:33:18,819
just love or went to
park, pond, theatre...

2384
02:33:19,023 --> 02:33:19,955
Sir...

2385
02:33:20,157 --> 02:33:21,522
Leave it boss.

2386
02:33:21,725 --> 02:33:24,819
lf there's a super figure in the area,
such tales are common.

2387
02:33:25,029 --> 02:33:26,724
Few guys like you
would go after them.

2388
02:33:26,931 --> 02:33:28,899
Only then it's merit for the figure.

2389
02:33:29,099 --> 02:33:32,091
l don't care if she likes me or not,

2390
02:33:32,303 --> 02:33:33,930
but l'll marry her only,

2391
02:33:34,305 --> 02:33:37,934
so you do one thing,
stop following beautiful girls,

2392
02:33:38,642 --> 02:33:41,304
for your status and
your qualifications,

2393
02:33:41,512 --> 02:33:44,276
find and select some
ordinary, plain looking girl,

2394
02:33:44,481 --> 02:33:45,106
why not try like that?

2395
02:33:46,217 --> 02:33:49,709
Never give up trying, Baskar.
Keep on struggling.

2396
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:51,544
Hard work never fails.

2397
02:33:51,755 --> 02:33:53,120
Okay? Bye.

2398
02:33:53,757 --> 02:33:54,621
Sir, one minute.

2399
02:33:57,661 --> 02:33:58,787
First listen what l'm trying to say...

2400
02:33:58,996 --> 02:34:01,157
You can't marry her till l'm alive,

2401
02:34:01,365 --> 02:34:04,129
l'm like that, l'm like this,
will you deliver such dialogues?

2402
02:34:04,335 --> 02:34:05,632
Please don't dream, boss.

2403
02:34:09,106 --> 02:34:10,801
l love Chandrika.

2404
02:34:11,008 --> 02:34:12,441
She too loves me sincerely.

2405
02:34:12,643 --> 02:34:15,578
You're talking like a mad man
without knowing all this.

2406
02:34:15,779 --> 02:34:18,145
Don't you've any shame?
Are you so insensitive?

2407
02:34:19,016 --> 02:34:21,814
What do you eat?
Food or anything else?

2408
02:34:22,987 --> 02:34:25,820
Am l coward if l come in a suit?

2409
02:34:26,023 --> 02:34:28,992
Shall l show you how low l stoop to?
Shall l show?

2410
02:34:29,927 --> 02:34:30,916
You'll get beaten up.

2411
02:34:32,396 --> 02:34:37,993
You're like a chocolate hero but
raising hell claiming to be local.

2412
02:34:38,402 --> 02:34:39,994
l must know how local you are?

2413
02:34:40,204 --> 02:34:42,263
- Tell me.
- Shall l? Shall l tell?

2414
02:34:43,340 --> 02:34:45,103
- Let's have a competition of bad words,
- What?

2415
02:34:45,309 --> 02:34:47,334
must use it non-stop
for 10 minutes,

2416
02:34:47,544 --> 02:34:49,603
who ever wins, the girl is theirs.

2417
02:34:49,813 --> 02:34:53,374
- What? Deal or no deal?
- Hey, she's my lover.

2418
02:34:53,584 --> 02:34:54,881
Deal or no deal?

2419
02:35:08,666 --> 02:35:11,863
Son-in-law...son-in-law...
what happened?

2420
02:35:12,503 --> 02:35:37,022


2421
02:35:37,828 --> 02:35:42,265
Open the door, Baskar.

2422
02:35:50,307 --> 02:35:52,901
Security, open the door.
lf you can't break it open.

2423
02:35:54,878 --> 02:35:59,247
- Should it be opened this side?
- Aren't you a bank manager?

2424
02:36:03,253 --> 02:36:05,585
- Enough....enough...
- Why buddy?

2425
02:36:05,789 --> 02:36:08,189
- Cool drinks is not good for health.
- ls it so?

2426
02:36:08,392 --> 02:36:09,950
ls it correct now?

2427
02:36:14,832 --> 02:36:20,099
Teetotaler means a honest man
without any bad habits

2428
02:36:30,414 --> 02:36:31,608
Buddy, he's here.

2429
02:36:33,417 --> 02:36:35,715
Father-in-law, get me a quarter.

2430
02:36:35,986 --> 02:36:38,750
Son-in-law! What's all this?

2431
02:36:38,956 --> 02:36:41,652
Do you drink?
l can't believe it.

2432
02:36:41,859 --> 02:36:43,986
Your father told me great about you.

2433
02:36:44,194 --> 02:36:46,890
No father knows fully about his son.

2434
02:36:47,097 --> 02:36:49,122
All fathers think their son
is a gentleman.

2435
02:36:49,333 --> 02:36:50,095
So what?

2436
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:51,562
Buddy, you make a drink.

2437
02:36:52,336 --> 02:36:53,394
Pour...pour...

2438
02:36:53,971 --> 02:36:58,067
Son-in-law, you came in suit
and cheated me.

2439
02:36:58,275 --> 02:37:00,266
Who told you people in suits
are gentlemen?

2440
02:37:00,477 --> 02:37:01,466
Did l claim so?

2441
02:37:01,678 --> 02:37:04,340
l'm wearing suit to conceal
quarter bottles.

2442
02:37:05,816 --> 02:37:06,908
Buddy, side dish.

2443
02:37:08,118 --> 02:37:11,986
Son-in-law, l told everyone
that you're teetotaler.

2444
02:37:13,857 --> 02:37:16,223
Father-in-law, l don't drink
tea or coffee.

2445
02:37:16,427 --> 02:37:17,826
Only brandy!

2446
02:37:18,028 --> 02:37:19,893
Pickle is best with brandy, buddy.

2447
02:37:20,097 --> 02:37:21,325
Pickle...pickle...

2448
02:37:21,865 --> 02:37:24,095
Pickle.
lt's empty.

2449
02:37:25,068 --> 02:37:26,831
ls it okay if he too joins, buddy?

2450
02:37:29,673 --> 02:37:32,039
Father-in-law, ran out of pickle,
please sit here,

2451
02:37:32,176 --> 02:37:33,609
- we'll use you.
- What man?

2452
02:37:33,877 --> 02:37:35,037
Are you playing with me?

2453
02:37:35,179 --> 02:37:37,374
Talking to me without any respect.

2454
02:37:37,581 --> 02:37:40,516
- l'll call your dad, you'll know then.
- Father?

2455
02:37:40,884 --> 02:37:41,714
He's calling my dad.

2456
02:37:41,919 --> 02:37:46,083
- Uncle...please don't call my father.
- Wait...wait...

2457
02:37:46,190 --> 02:37:49,523
l'm terribly scared, uncle...
Please tell him.

2458
02:37:49,726 --> 02:37:50,988
Get lost mad man!

2459
02:37:51,195 --> 02:37:52,685
Will you call my father?

2460
02:37:52,896 --> 02:37:54,193
Look at his face!

2461
02:37:55,833 --> 02:37:56,959
Sorry Mr. Sundaram.

2462
02:37:57,167 --> 02:37:59,362
ln life you'll always find a better one,

2463
02:37:59,570 --> 02:38:02,801
so superstar has told in a film to
be content and happy with what you've.

2464
02:38:03,006 --> 02:38:05,270
You selected me saying
his character is not good,

2465
02:38:05,476 --> 02:38:07,808
will you select another man
saying my character is not good?

2466
02:38:08,378 --> 02:38:10,539
lt'll go on like a chugging train.

2467
02:38:10,747 --> 02:38:11,645
How will it be, buddy?

2468
02:38:16,086 --> 02:38:18,714
- What l'm trying to say it...
- Buddy, getting late.

2469
02:38:27,264 --> 02:38:28,231
All the best.

2470
02:38:28,432 --> 02:38:29,899
What more can l say?

2471
02:38:30,100 --> 02:38:33,228
l'm happy that you've
united me and Baskar.

2472
02:38:33,637 --> 02:38:36,902
But can l know the reason
for your sudden change?

2473
02:38:37,107 --> 02:38:39,405
l'm also happy for what has
happened now.

2474
02:38:39,610 --> 02:38:42,579
What made you change
your mind suddenly?

2475
02:38:42,779 --> 02:38:44,508
Are you friend of Baskar?

2476
02:38:44,748 --> 02:38:47,683
ls it drama played by you,
Baskar and Nallathambi?

2477
02:38:47,885 --> 02:38:48,749
lndeed it's drama, sir.

2478
02:38:48,952 --> 02:38:52,581
But not a drama enacted by me,
Baskar and Nallathambi.

2479
02:38:52,956 --> 02:38:53,923
Wait...wait...

2480
02:38:55,292 --> 02:38:57,089
Hello! Who is it?
Calling at odd hour.

2481
02:38:57,294 --> 02:38:59,524
You sinner! Have you forgotten
me so quickly?

2482
02:38:59,730 --> 02:39:04,667
- Sir, l'm this film's director.
- Hey Rajesh! Then...

2483
02:39:04,868 --> 02:39:06,301
- How are you?
- Leave all that.

2484
02:39:06,503 --> 02:39:07,731
What's all this, sir?

2485
02:39:07,938 --> 02:39:08,962
l called you for guest appearance,

2486
02:39:09,072 --> 02:39:12,132
but you're feeling like hero
and indulging in fights too.

2487
02:39:12,409 --> 02:39:16,436
Not like that director,
the heroine was beautiful,

2488
02:39:16,647 --> 02:39:20,276
so l got little emotional...
slightly...changed...

2489
02:39:20,484 --> 02:39:23,078
lf the heroine is beautiful,
will you cross your limit?

2490
02:39:23,287 --> 02:39:25,118
Will you change your path?

2491
02:39:25,322 --> 02:39:28,257
Guest appearance means you must
unite hero and heroine in climax.

2492
02:39:28,458 --> 02:39:29,891
That's what has been going
since long time.

2493
02:39:30,093 --> 02:39:32,391
Yeah, you're right...

2494
02:39:32,596 --> 02:39:34,564
Unnecessarily you broke pipe also.

2495
02:39:34,765 --> 02:39:37,893
- Go, go now and unite them.
- Okay, definitely.

2496
02:39:38,201 --> 02:39:38,963
Action!

2497
02:39:39,770 --> 02:39:40,759
- Action?
- Yes sir.

2498
02:39:40,971 --> 02:39:42,131
Wait...wait...

2499
02:39:42,773 --> 02:39:44,297
Hello Arya, that Nayanthara...

Unemployed but always busy...

2506
02:40:07,397 --> 02:40:10,924
When we play cricket, temple tower
is the boundary line...

2507
02:40:11,134 --> 02:40:17,437
Nobody every asked me if
l'm a good man or a bad man...

2508
02:40:19,042 --> 02:40:22,808
Boss...boss...ask my name, boss...

2509
02:40:23,013 --> 02:40:27,347

Uncle...uncle...give your
daughter in marriage...

May l tie knot with her amidst
marriage band playing...

2512
02:40:57,681 --> 02:41:00,445
Come...come...
come shedding your shyness...

2513
02:41:00,651 --> 02:41:07,079
Silence is also acceptance...
