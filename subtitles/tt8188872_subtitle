1
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,840
George, I'm really confident
about this project.

2
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,360
We can finish it in
two months' time.

3
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,320
This is its initial design.

4
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,440
Have your coffee, pal.

5
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,880
Abin, actually we can't continue
with this project.

6
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,320
Our company is going
through its worst phase.

7
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,400
I don't think our company
will get such a big project

8
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,960
in the near future.

9
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,040
Above all,
you're really talented

10
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,720
and you've years of experience
working in Dubai.

11
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,760
Actually

12
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,280
you're way too
qualified and talented

13
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,920
for us to afford you any more.
That's the truth.

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,280
Do you want to say something?
- No.. Absolutely no.

15
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,880
I think this is the right time.

16
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,640
You've enough contacts
in this city, right?

17
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,480
I'm really tired
and I want to leave this job.

18
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,840
Even I want a break.

19
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
There is a reason.
Priya is pregnant.

20
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,680
Really? That's good news.
Congratulations, pal!

21
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,520
So, things are working out.
- Yes. I guess..

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
It was a pleasure.

23
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,840
Anyway, George,
you've been wonderful.

24
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,760
You needn't hurry.
Finish your coffee, pal.

25
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,520
No, I'll just meet everyone.

26
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I'll inform all of them.
And have a smoke..

27
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,200
Sorry about this.

28
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,840
No.. Absolutely no.

29
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,560
Thank you, George.

30
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,400
It's been a pleasure.
- Same here.

31
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,720
Let me walk you out.
- Yes.

32
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,280
Can I take this? My phone..
- Yes.

33
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,640
{\an8}'Smoking is injurious to health.'

34
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,480
{\an8}Hello.
- 'Abin.' - Yes.

35
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,600
{\an8}'Have you started
from the office?'

36
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,120
{\an8}No, we had a board meeting
today morning.

37
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,880
{\an8}'Okay, I'll go along
with Shantha.'

38
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,720
{\an8}'Call me when
you leave the office.'

39
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,800
{\an8}Okay.

40
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,120
Why did you bring a gift?

41
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,920
How was the presentation?

42
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,960
Well, that didn't work out.

43
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,280
The client backed off
at the last moment.

44
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
What happened then?

45
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,320
The board is really confused

46
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,360
as the company
doesn't have any new projects.

47
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,560
I mean, about my job.

48
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,560
Did you buy this stuff
to break the news to me?

49
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
No. I bought it on a whim.

50
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
I'm fine, dear.

51
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,280
I'll be with you hereafter.

52
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,000
You need rest at this stage.

53
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,080
Abin.

54
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,000
I met the doctor
along with Shantha.

55
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,080
They couldn't hear the heartbeat
during the scan.

56
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,760
They said, 'There is no hope.'

57
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,880
Why didn't you inform me?

58
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,440
You were in the office
handling your presentation.

59
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,240
I didn't want
to make you upset.

60
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Are you all right?

61
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
It was not planned anyway.

62
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,160
It happened accidentally.

63
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,000
Maybe, it's not the right time.

64
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,640
We at least understood
that we can become parents.

65
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,840
Abin, get up. Let's eat out.

66
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,160
Do you really want to go out?

67
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,640
Abin, don't be so boring.

68
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,280
I'll get ready soon.

69
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,800
Do you remember
our first drive?

70
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,200
It was to Mamzar, right?

71
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,400
With the IBM gang.
- Yes.

72
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,640
I miss that.

73
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,560
I really miss those days, Abin.

74
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,240
"You are the synonym of love."

75
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,720
"You're the truth
that I'm looking for."

76
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,160
"You're a budding flower which
would slowly blossom in me."

77
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,680
"I saw her
in the morning twilight."

78
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,440
"She was as beautiful
as the moonlight."

79
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,560
"I heard your voice
during a hot summer"

80
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,680
"and it comforted me.."

81
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,400
"Oh, love! I'm preparing myself"

82
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,720
"to be yours."

83
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,440
"I'm trying to find you"

84
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,400
"as I want to be
a part of your life."

85
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,440
"I waited for so long.."

86
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,360
"I waited.."

87
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,720
"To see my reflection in you."

88
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,680
"You're the synonym of love."

89
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,440
"You're the truth
that I'm looking for."

90
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,720
"You're a budding flower which
would slowly blossom in me."

91
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,800
"You're as beautiful
as a poem."

92
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,280
"You're the fire of my life."

93
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,560
"You're the song which I
desperately want to sing."

94
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,360
Thank you.

95
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,560
I called up my mom soon
after I left the hospital.

96
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,000
Did you divulge it to her?

97
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,760
No, I just called her up
to hear her voice.

98
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,880
Good. Had she got to know
about it, she would've panicked.

99
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,160
Abin, shall we leave
this city for a while?

100
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,840
What happened?

101
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,320
I'm really tired of this place.

102
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,320
The same feeling that I'd when
I went to school on Mondays.

103
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,320
You never studied
in a boarding school, right?

104
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,480
Every day was like
Monday for me.

105
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
That's not it, Abin.

106
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,680
Why are we staying here needlessly
paying a huge rent?

107
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
I could meet my mom and my sister
if we're in our home town.

108
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,600
You could also go to Bangalore and
spend some time with your brother.

109
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,160
What about your job?

110
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Not an issue.

111
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,920
I can work from home

112
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,600
as I'd applied for it
because of my pregnancy.

113
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,760
I just need a laptop
and a Wi-Fi connection.

114
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,840
That's one of the few advantages
of working in this field.

115
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,760
Isn't it better to launch your
start-up at our home town?

116
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,120
You know about start-ups, right?

117
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,600
There is very less chance
that it will succeed.

118
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,720
It's okay, Abin.
Take your time.

119
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,840
It's your long-time dream, right?

120
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,200
You haven't seen dad's plantation
at Eighteenth Mile, right?

121
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,880
You'll love it.

122
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,640
It will also be a change for us.

123
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,520
Let's go and stay there.

124
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,640
It would be better than eating
the organic food of this city.

125
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,560
It's a good idea.

126
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,720
Won't you miss Dubai?

127
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,920
We'll come back
if we miss this place.

128
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,120
{\an8}Really?

129
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,760
Do you want to smoke
yourself to death or what?

130
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,040
{\an8}'Attention, please.'

131
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,120
{\an8}'Venus Airlines Flight IC 367..'
- 'VARATHAN'

132
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,440
'...from Dubai to Kochi
is ready for take-off.'

133
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,160
'On behalf of the captain'

134
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,720
'and rest of the crew,
we welcome you on-board.'

135
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,800
'If you need anything'

136
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,040
'please let us know.'

137
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,400
'Until then sit back, relax'

138
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,000
'and enjoy this flight.'

139
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,560
'Sit back, relax'

140
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,280
'and enjoy this flight.'

141
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,840
'Sit back, relax
and enjoy this flight.'

142
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,440
'Attention, please.'

143
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,200
'Attention, please.'

144
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,160
'Sit back, relax'

145
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,840
'and enjoy this flight.'

146
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,200
Mister, is there no rain?

147
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,320
Not really.

148
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,400
Dear, why don't you stay here
for a few days before leaving?

149
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,680
No way.

150
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,480
Why? - Mom, we'll be here
for a while.

151
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,280
We'll visit you next weekend.

152
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,680
Hey! Set the table

153
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,600
instead of eating
all the 'Papads'.

154
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,920
Kurian hasn't visited you guys
for a long time, right?

155
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,720
He was here
just a few days ago.

156
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
He has to retire after
one and a half years.

157
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,480
The service
can be extended, right?

158
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,680
What's the point
in extending the service?

159
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,800
Getting a job after
retiring from the Air Force

160
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,040
at the age of 48
is very difficult.

161
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,280
Kurian will surely get a job.

162
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,080
As if you've a job
to offer him.

163
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,720
Even youngsters are
struggling to get a job. - No.

164
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,800
Abin, pass me that curry.

165
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,960
Government servants get pension
after retirement. - Mom.

166
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,160
What is your plan, Abin?
- Mom.

167
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,200
I'm planning to launch
a start-up. - Mom.

168
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,520
What is that?
Private or government sector?

169
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,080
What kind of a question is that,
Mom?

170
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,280
I'll bring the glasses.

171
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,960
Abin, eat.

172
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,680
Did mother-in-law go to bed?
- Yes.

173
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,840
{\an8}Mom is becoming
more practical with age.

174
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,680
{\an8}She struggled a lot
to bring us up

175
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,160
{\an8}after my dad's demise.

176
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,280
{\an8}Don't take that seriously.

177
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,800
{\an8}It's all right, dear.

178
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
{\an8}She will be concerned
about her daughters' life.

179
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,320
{\an8}Let's leave early morning.
Maria has let us borrow her car.

180
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,080
Come here on weekends.
- Yes..

181
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,480
Have you saved Mr. Benny's
contact number? - Yes.

182
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,160
I've told him to get you the
internet and the gas connections.

183
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,600
Abin, he is a little annoying,
but be in good terms with him.

184
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,520
He is useful.
- Shut up.

185
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,280
He is an innocent guy.
You can trust him.

186
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,880
But he is slightly into politics.

187
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,960
That's all.

188
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,160
He has all the bad qualities
that come with it.

189
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,040
Since you guys will be there,
keep an eye on everything.

190
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,280
Okay, Mother-in-law. See you.
- Bye. - Maria. - See you.

191
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,800
Inform Kunjumol
once she is awake.

192
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,320
I'll surely visit you next week.

193
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,920
Go.

194
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,960
The 'Appam' and stew
she prepared was delicious.

195
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,960
Really? You should've
told this to mom

196
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,240
instead of telling me.

197
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,720
She might have understood.
I ate a lot.

198
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,440
But you could've told her.

199
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,440
Why did you get inside
the car so soon?

200
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,200
You could've held her hand
and said goodbye.

201
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,800
I am not good at
following such etiquettes.

202
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,360
Okay.
I know that.

203
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,880
Leave my hand. Let me drive.

204
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,600
I won't.

205
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,960
Sir, can you please drop him
at Eighteenth Mile?

206
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
He has an examination. There
is no bus service at this time.

207
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,560
Can you please drop him
at the school?

208
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,280
Yes.. Get in..

209
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,800
Okay.

210
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,440
Which exam are you taking today?

211
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,520
Mathematics.

212
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,120
Sir, can you please stop the car?

213
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,480
Why?
- I want to get down here.

214
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,320
What time is your exam?
- Mathematics.

215
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,520
You asked about the subject, right?
- Yes, it's mathematics!

216
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,560
Okay, sir.

217
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,960
Kids of this generation
are clear about everything.

218
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,160
Mathematics.

219
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,880
Sir, two cups of tea.

220
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,920
{\an8}Do you want cut cakes?

221
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,400
{\an8}One is enough.
We'll share it.

222
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
{\an8}Sir, one cut cake.

223
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,480
Where are you heading to, sir?
- Are you going to the resort?

224
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,440
No. To a nearby place. Palathingal.

225
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,440
I see. DFO Paul's place.

226
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,920
You work in the Air Force, right?
- No, I work in Dubai.

227
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,200
Priya.

228
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,560
You didn't recognise me, right?

229
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,320
Your mother and sister
still live in Kochi, right?

230
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,400
Yes..

231
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,960
Hello. - Yes.
- Rs. 27.

232
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Take Rs. 30.

233
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,760
Okay.

234
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,320
Sir, the change..
- That's okay..

235
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
Some people are keen
on ruining our culture.

236
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,840
I wish I was born in this age.

237
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,200
{\an8}'Gents' Beauty Parlour.'

238
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,520
Greetings, sir.
Hi, Ms. Priya.

239
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,000
Sir, please get off.
Let me park the car.

240
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,080
It's okay.

241
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,120
Well, it's something else.
It's an old water service setup.

242
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,400
The car will fall into that drain
if not parked correctly.

243
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,600
Shall I try?

244
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,680
Okay.

245
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,280
It seems he is really adventurous.

246
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,400
Was your journey fine?
- It was good.

247
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,160
How is your mother?
- She is fine.

248
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,920
Do you remember
that vehicle?

249
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,720
Of course.

250
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,080
Dad used to drop me
at school on it.

251
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
It works fine even now.

252
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,680
It's perfect for short trips.

253
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,840
Really?
- Those two.

254
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,680
Sir, I'm Benny.
- Abin.

255
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,600
Sir, let me carry it.
- No. It's okay..

256
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,240
Murugan, take all the luggage.
- What?

257
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,680
Keep that inside.
- It's okay. Keep it there.

258
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,120
Sir, this is Murugan.

259
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,320
Murugan is versatile.

260
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,560
Where are you from?

261
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,840
A place near Theni.
- Okay.

262
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,920
Take it.

263
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,520
Abin, is the internet
connection working?

264
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,280
It will surely work.
He is good at this.

265
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,560
I'm able to connect
and its speed is good.

266
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,240
So, shall we leave?

267
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,760
Sir, let us take your leave.
- Okay. - Okay, see you tomorrow.

268
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,400
Okay.
- Mr. Benny

269
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,320
don't you drink?

270
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,160
Sir, I'm fasting. I don't drink
at this time of the year.

271
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,360
Sorry.. I forgot that.

272
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,920
Sir, please give it as it's the
first thing that you've offered me.

273
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,440
{\an8}I can drink it once the
fast ends. Right, ma'am?

274
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,920
{\an8}'Alcohol consumption
is injurious to health.'

275
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,800
{\an8}Okay. - Okay. - Bye.

276
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,120
Bye, sir.
- Okay. See you tomorrow.

277
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,640
Abin, bring the suitcases as well.
- Okay.

278
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,600
My grandpa bought this
property from this man.

279
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,680
This is my grandpa.

280
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,520
Mr. Varghese Paul.

281
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,400
He was an advisor of the
British magistrate of this town.

282
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,280
This is my father-in-law, right?

283
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,200
Mr. Paul was really handsome!

284
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,440
Right?

285
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Abin.

286
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,960
You look great!

287
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
These are night-vision goggles.

288
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,440
That's my grandpa's.
- Okay.

289
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Hero pen.

290
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,000
It's exactly like a villain's
den from an 80s movie!

291
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,480
Cockroach..

292
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,200
Hey..
Don't kill it..

293
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,120
Why did you kill it?

294
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,920
Then? Should I've made
it my pet or what?

295
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,520
You shouldn't have killed it.
It would've lived somewhere.

296
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,080
I don't want it
to live in my house.

297
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,480
This is my dad's biogas set-up.

298
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,320
Nice. Mr. Paul was some man!

299
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,080
Yes, but this set-up was a flop.

300
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,360
Oh, God! It's so noisy.

301
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,200
It's the sound of male crickets.

302
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,920
Who said so?
- My dad used to say that.

303
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,720
Oh!

304
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,680
Why do they make this sound?

305
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,920
To attract female crickets.

306
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,680
Really?

307
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,360
They will never get attracted.

Abin.
- Good morning.

314
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,840
Didn't you sleep?
- I woke up early.

315
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,800
It has been so long
since we sat together like this.

316
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,160
We've enough time to do it now.

317
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,280
My mom and dad
used to drink coffee here.

318
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,760

319
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,760
Abin. What are you thinking?

320
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,720
I was thinking that I don't have

321
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,120
many nostalgic
experiences to share.

322
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,440
What do you call it?

323
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,080
Reminiscence.
- Oh, God!

324
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,200
It's so tough to pronounce.
How can we feel it then!

I studied from eighth grade
to twelfth grade in this school.

333
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,640
Really?
- Yes.

334
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,680
We shifted to Kochi
after dad's demise.

335
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,320
Good morning, Sister?
- Where is your classroom?

336
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,440
Well.. It's there.

337
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,720
This is a new block.

00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,320
You're Priya Paul, right?
- Yes..

339
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,560
How are you, dear?

00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,480
I'm fine.
This is Abin.

How are you, Sister?
- I'm fine.

342
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,680
She has read all the books
in this library.

343
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,440
What you said is right.
She has a great memory.

344
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,400
She said your name
after just one glance.

345
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,640
It's not that
she remembers everyone.

346
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,800
She remembers me
as I was her favourite student.

347
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,680
Oh! Okay.
- Really.

348
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,920
Okay.

349
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,280
Really.
- I believe you.

350
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,960
Give it to me.

351
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,320
Shall I get two
cut cakes for you?

352
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,840
No. It seems you could start
a fans' association here!

353
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,080
Abin, look at that guy.

354
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,840
He ogles women.

355
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,120
It's difficult
to even walk close to him.

356
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,040
My sister and I used to
refer to him as 'Chameleon'.

357
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,280
Why? - He used to make us feel
really uncomfortable.

358
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,720
Hey.
She is Lilly's youngest daughter.

359
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,160
Maria's younger sister.

360
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,560
She is more gorgeous
than her mother and sister.

361
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,560
He is really lucky.

362
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,640
Even when my parents' moved here,
he used to sit there like this.

363
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,360
She is Maria's sister.

364
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,040
{\an8}Priya Paul. Class 12 B.

365
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,840
Are you tired?
- A bit.

366
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,640
Take rest for a while.
- Okay.

367
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,480
Mr. Benny is already here.

368
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
Mr. Benny.

369
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,040
Good morning.
- Good morning..

370
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,800
Where did you guys go?
- For a walk.

371
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,120
I thought of selling
all the pepper we have.

372
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,160
I see.

373
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,800
How much is its selling price?
- Nothing substantial.

374
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,040
The business is dull.
No one really wants it.

375
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,480
After paying the labourers,
we won't have anything left.

376
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,080
Our effort goes in vain.

377
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
Murugan, bring everything
that's kept there. - Yes.

378
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,920
They..

379
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,480
I told them to supply a bottle
of milk twice a day.

380
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,800
It's good quality milk, sir.

381
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,600
They have good quality cows.

382
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,240
They live nearby.
They are poor people.

383
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,600
Did you recognise them?
- Was it for them?

384
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,120
How was your examination?

385
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,880
He always says
that it was average.

386
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,320
Give the bottle to him.

387
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,560
What's your name?
- Preman.

388
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,600
Preman.

389
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,600
Shall we leave, sir?

390
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,360
Sir.

391
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,840
How do you know them?

392
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,400
Mr. Benny, even we know
a few people of this village.

393
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,400
What do you want,
coffee or tea?

394
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
Tea.

395
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,160
You're lucky, Ms. Priya.
He is really caring.

396
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,520
How are your wife and kids?

397
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,160
Yes. Raechel's examinations
are going on.

398
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,480
So, my wife and my daughter
are always in the church.

399
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
I see.

400
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,280
Parunthumpara is not like
how it was before.

401
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,520
It got renovated. Tiles were laid.
The place is worth watching.

402
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,400
Visit the place
someday with Mr. Abin.

403
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,480
You made the tea
so quickly.

404
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,560
Here you go.

405
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,440
Shall I also go sell the pepper?

406
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,040
You guys have come here
to take rest.

407
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,280
Why do you want to do it?

408
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,440
That's okay, sir.

409
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,600
It's good to know about all that.
- That's right.

410
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,160
Do one thing.
Get ready quickly, sir.

411
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,400
Shall I finish my tea first?
- Sure.

412
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,960
Sir, are you looking
for a job here?

413
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,880
I have to.
I'll do that after a while.

414
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,960
If you want a servant
to do the household chores

415
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,320
I'll inform Preman's mother.

416
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,360
No, we can manage it.

417
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,480
Sir, please pull over.
- Okay.

418
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,760
He has come.

419
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,040
Did all the cement sacks arrive?

420
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,920
Yes, we've unloaded it.
- Is it? - Yes.

421
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
I'll just go to the town
and come back. - Okay.

422
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,800
What building is that?

423
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,920
The new information centre.

424
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,720
No one can do anything wrong
in this town once it's ready.

425
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,320
We can keep an eye
on everything from there.

426
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,280
What could possibly happen here?

427
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,680
You can't even begin to imagine.

428
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,960
The other day,
a guy took his wife to the hill

429
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,640
and pushed her down the cliff.

430
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,880
He murdered her.

431
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,960
He then filed a complaint
to the police

432
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,520
that his wife is missing.

433
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,480
The police searched the vicinity.

434
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,840
They found nothing except
a pig's skeleton.

435
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,880
That's about it.

436
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,640
What happened next?

437
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,840
Isn't it obvious?

438
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,480
He escaped
by bribing the police.

439
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,040
Strangers come here
and commit such crimes.

440
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,840
We're the ones who suffer.

441
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,040
Don't you understand, sir?
It's simple as that.

442
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,520
I am getting a hang of things.

443
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,640
72 multiplied by 456

444
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,120
{\an8}is equal to 30,080.

445
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,360
{\an8}We'd learned that

446
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,680
{\an8}72 multiplied by 456
is equal to 32,832.

447
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,480
{\an8}Calculate once again. - 72
multiplied by 456 is equal to..

448
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,560
{\an8}He is right. 32,832.

449
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,680
{\an8}How could you make a mistake
while using a calculator?

450
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,720
{\an8}That's because of this cold
and cosy weather.

451
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,800
{\an8}It doesn't work properly
during winter, right?

452
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,120
{\an8}Mr. Benny, let's go.

453
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,200
{\an8}Isn't this the whole amount?
I'll count. - Okay.

454
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,800
He is our regular buyer.

455
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,520
Is Mr. Benny here?

456
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,000
Who are you?

457
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,280
Jithin.

458
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,120
Contractor Pappalli sent me here.

459
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,120
Mr. Benny is not here.
He has gone out.

460
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,200
Contractor Pappalli
has asked

461
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,880
Mr. Benny to come there.

462
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,960
I'll inform him.

463
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,680
{\an8}Do you want one?
- No.

464
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,920
{\an8}Or else give me one.

465
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,480
{\an8}I'll give it to my friend.

466
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,360
{\an8}Foreign cigarettes
are really expensive here.

467
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,680
{\an8}She might have fallen asleep.

468
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,120
{\an8}Priya.

469
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,360
{\an8}She'd have fallen asleep.
- Maybe..

470
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,160
{\an8}Priya.

471
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,960
{\an8}Sorry.. I was attending
a client's call.

472
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,960
{\an8}Here is the money that
we got by selling pepper.

473
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,600
{\an8}I needn't go to Kochi
for giving this.

474
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,040
{\an8}Yes, you can give it to me.

475
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,560
{\an8}Shall I leave, sir?
- Okay.

476
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,280
{\an8}Sir. - Yes.
- Someone called Pappalli sent

477
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,920
{\an8}a guy to inform you that he
wanted to meet you.

478
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,360
{\an8}He has taken our land on
lease for agriculture.

479
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,520
{\an8}I'll meet him tomorrow.
Okay, sir.

480
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,400
{\an8}Can I come with you?
- Okay.

481
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,920
{\an8}Okay, see you tomorrow.

482
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,080
Wow!

483
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,640
{\an8}Nice.

484
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,480
{\an8}Happy anniversary.

485
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,520
{\an8}Happy anniversary to us.

486
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,880
{\an8}Four years.

487
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,200
{\an8}So, one.. Two..

488
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,720
{\an8}Let me arrange the rest.

489
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,560
{\an8}Three.. Four..

490
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,840
{\an8}I had called up Thomas.

491
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,840
{\an8}I explained to him the basic plan
of my start-up. - Really?

492
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,800
{\an8}What did he say?
- He is a little busy.

493
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,400
{\an8}He said that we could
discuss once he is free.

494
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,360
{\an8}It's okay to wait for a good
designer like him.

495
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,800
{\an8}Abin, take enough time
to do it.

496
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,440
{\an8}Everything else is fine.

497
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,920
{\an8}Thank you.

498
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,920
{\an8}Hold this.

499
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,040
{\an8}Do you know
which couple lived together

500
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,320
{\an8}for the most number of years?

501
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,320
{\an8}Who are they?
- Shoshama Thomas

502
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,640
and Philipose Thomas.

503
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,320
{\an8}Are they from Kerala?
- Yes. They were from Kottayam.

504
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,320
{\an8}Shoshama was 12
and Philipose was 13 years old

505
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,160
{\an8}when they got married.

506
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,640
{\an8}They lived together for 90 years.

507
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,320
{\an8}Let's hit a century then.
- Sure.

508
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,520
{\an8}To Shoshama.
- And Philipose.

509
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,600
{\an8}And to our happiness.
- Happiness.

510
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,960
{\an8}Blow it.
- Together.

511
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,000
{\an8}Yes.

512
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,880
{\an8}One.. Two..

513
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,520
{\an8}Three.

514
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,240
Abin, someone is standing there.

515
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,240
What?
- Someone is standing there.

516
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,400
There is no one here.

517
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,160
I saw someone
near the window.

518
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,080
It must have been a dream.

519
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,480
Come, let's sleep.

520
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,240
Come.

521
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,960
{\an8}'Wear helmets while riding
motorcycles.'

522
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,240
{\an8}Sir

523
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,600
{\an8}the man who is sitting
on the wall and drinking

524
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,680
{\an8}is Contractor
Kuriachan's brother-in-law, Baby.

525
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,080
{\an8}He is in the army and he is
a heavy drinker. He is on leave.

526
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,320
{\an8}The other guy is Kuriachan's
second brother, Peter.

527
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,480
{\an8}He is single.

528
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,600
Did you notice that bodybuilder?

529
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,200
He is the youngest.
His name is Kunjimon.

530
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,800
He is short-tempered and reckless.

531
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,800
{\an8}That man who is wearing eyeglasses
is the contractor's father.

532
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,600
{\an8}They shifted to this place
during his dad's time.

533
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,080
I see. - Did you notice
that guy standing near

534
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,760
the jeep wearing trousers?
He is the contractor's son, Johnny.

535
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,280
The guy who is standing next
to him is Jithin.

536
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,120
He sticks around here.
He is a nobody.

537
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,920
Don't be afraid.
Come this way, sir.

538
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,480
He is the contractor..

539
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,160
He took all the land good for
farming, in this village, on lease.

540
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,520
Don't be afraid.. Come.

541
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,600
It won't hurt you.

542
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,440
This is Mr. Paul's youngest
daughter's husband.

543
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,240
Abin.
- Abin.

544
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,280
Did the dog scare you?
- Well..

545
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,120
He got a bit terrified.
- I was wondering

546
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,320
who the stranger
accompanying Benny was.

547
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,080
If you're terrified of him now

548
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,400
what would you do if he breaks
the chain and runs at you?

549
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,200
{\an8}Dear, bring that packet
inside my table's drawer.

550
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,480
{\an8}Okay, Dad.

551
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,800
{\an8}Who is that?

552
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,880
{\an8}It's me, sir.
Benny from Parakudi.

553
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,000
Hey!

554
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,840
{\an8}There are gorgeous women there.

555
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,360
{\an8}It's useless talking to you.

556
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,880
{\an8}You've never seen
gorgeous women.

557
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,080
{\an8}You've only seen the ordinary
women of this town.

558
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,040
{\an8}I'll manage with that,
Brother-in-law.

559
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,120
{\an8}Whatever.

560
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,160
{\an8}Kunjimon, give us company.

561
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,840
{\an8}No.
- Exercise well.

562
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,240
Give that to him.

563
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,880
You're in the tenth grade, right?
- Yes.

564
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,160
Sandra, right?

565
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,640
Dad, I'm leaving.
- Okay.

566
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,240
Did your elder daughter return
after completing her education?

567
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
Jessy has gone to attend
the pre-marriage course.

568
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,200
What's the point
in educating girls?

569
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,920
Mom, I'm leaving.

570
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,320
Shall we leave?
- Carry on with your work.

571
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,160
Okay.
- Bye. - Okay.

572
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,200
Who is that?
- He is her husband.

573
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,000
She looks gorgeous now.

574
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,360
He is that military man's son.
His name is Josy.

575
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,480
He runs
a textiles shop in the town.

576
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,240
Did I scare you?

577
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,400
When did you come?
- Just a while ago.

578
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,680
Sweets that were bought
for Jessy's bride seeing ceremony.

579
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,120
I had some already.

580
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,000
{\an8}Priya?

581
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,320
Why do you do chores
that you shouldn't?

582
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,360
Give that to me.

583
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,120
Come and watch me
if you want to.

584
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,480
{\an8}He is in
an awful situation, isn't he?

585
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,960
{\an8}Not really. He is happy.

586
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,880
{\an8}I'm bothered about Priya.

587
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,440
{\an8}Hope he is taking
good care of her.

588
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,680
{\an8}It's obvious from his smile
that he is good-for-nothing.

589
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,000
{\an8}You have started drinking
so early in the day.

590
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,200
{\an8}Jithin, can't you do some work?

591
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,280
Come, Sabu.

592
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,320
{\an8}I think the yams
are ready for harvest.

593
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,360
{\an8}Whenever she smiles like this

594
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,920
{\an8}I remember our tour
to Ooty from school.

595
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,960
{\an8}Haven't I told you about it?
- Yes.

596
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,640
I've a start-up conference.

597
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,480
You can narrate that even now.

598
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,880
It'll be fun listening
to it in this mood watching her.

599
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,680
He is right.
Narrate that story, Mr. Josy.

600
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,080
{\an8}I spoke with her
for the first time

601
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,040
{\an8}during our tour to Ooty.
We were in the twelfth grade then.

602
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,000
I was afraid
of talking to her before that.

603
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,520
She was really studious.

604
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,480
All of us, who sat
at the back, were drunk.

605
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,240
She came and sat near
my seat at night

606
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,000
and asked me something.

607
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,840
'Could you please
close the window?'

608
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,560
That made me really nervous.

609
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,240
I was free from intoxication.

610
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,400
I asked if she was feeling cold.

611
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,440
She replied that the cold wind

612
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,080
would make her vomit.

613
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,520
I lied to her that my mom had
told me a remedy to it.

614
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,800
I asked her to keep a finger
on her belly button

615
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,960
for she wouldn't
feel nauseous anymore.

616
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,720
{\an8}Pour me another drink.

617
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,520
Abin, turn it inside out.

618
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,680
Not like that.
Turn it inside out.

619
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,120
Turn it inside out?
- Yes.

620
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,800
Turn its inner surface outside?
- Yes.

621
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,160
Does that matter?

622
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,960
Yes, it won't
pill if it's hung like this.

623
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,920
Oh! Technicalities.
- Yes.

624
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,760
Tell us the rest.

625
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,480
She fell asleep while we were
moving downhill.

626
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,560
I had gone crazy
as she came and talked to me

627
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,360
and I was looking at her.

628
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,640
{\an8}I kept my hand
on her abdomen

629
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,720
{\an8}when I felt
that she was going to vomit.

630
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,520
She kept her hand over mine.

631
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,320
I tried to take away my hand.

632
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,280
{\an8}But she held my hand
tight to her abdomen.

633
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,720
{\an8}Until we completed the descend..

634
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,640
{\an8}"I want to shelter you."

635
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,120
{\an8}"But with the beast inside"

636
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,880
{\an8}"there is nowhere we can hide."
- Abin.

637
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,080
{\an8}"No matter what.."

638
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,160
{\an8}What is it?

639
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,120
{\an8}Few of my clothes are missing.

640
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,400
{\an8}It will be there somewhere.

641
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,800
{\an8}Abin, I looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find it.

642
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,160
{\an8}Where can it be?

643
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,640
{\an8}Abin, it's my undergarments
that have gone missing.

644
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,720
{\an8}Where can it be?

645
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,320
{\an8}Abin, I don't find this funny.

646
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,320
{\an8}I'm sorry.

647
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,400
'So, I shifted people
to the valleys'

648
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,240
'located behind the wall.'

649
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,080
'I kept the natives safe'

650
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,680
'with the help of my weapons.'

651
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,480
'I stood up and spoke
to the rich men'

652
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,960
'and the commoners.'

653
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,000
'You need not be afraid of them.'

654
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:02,560
'He told us to fight for the
well-being of our brothers'

655
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,880
'sons, daughters, wives and houses
by keeping in our mind'

656
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,640
'that Jesus Christ
is powerful and supreme.'

657
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,480
'Let's pray'

658
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,080
'to the Almighty.'

659
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,120
'Oh, Jesus!'

660
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,760
'We pray to You.'

661
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,760
'Oh, Lord! Please protect us.'

662
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,520
'We pray to You..'

663
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,920
'Oh, Lord! Please protect us..'

664
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,480
Is duck meat available here?

665
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,400
How come you crave
duck meat all of a sudden?

666
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,600
In the past

667
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,320
when I used to visit my hometown,
mom used to prepare

668
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,560
'Appam'
and seasoned duck curry.

669
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,160
It was really delicious.
That's my brother's favourite.

670
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,840
Shall we go to Bangalore
and stay there for a few days?

671
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,720
Brother keeps on calling me.

672
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,440
Let's first sort out
everything here.

673
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,840
Okay.

674
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,320
I'll ask Mr. Benny
about the duck meat.

675
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,280
It may not be as delicious
as your mother's preparation.

676
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,040
But I'll try.

677
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,480
Abin.
- Yes.

678
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,200
Abin.
- What happened?

679
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,080
Abin.. A guy is standing there.
- Who is it?

680
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,520
He is looking through the window.

681
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,720
That's a scarecrow.

682
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,280
Can you please go and look?

683
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,680
Don't shout.

684
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,080
Abin.. What happened?

685
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,440
What happened?

686
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,320
Did you see the tape
which I had kept here?

687
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,680
Abin, what happened?

688
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,200
Abin, what are you taking?

689
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,120
He is working there.

690
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,840
The issue will be resolved
once we close that window.

691
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,600
W-When will you be free next week?

692
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,680
Let's do it that way then.

693
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,720
Then.. Hello..

694
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,960
Who was it?
- Thomas. He is my friend.

695
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,160
He is your classmate, right?

696
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,120
We were colleagues.
He is from Kottayam.

697
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,680
You can use my
mobile phone if it is urgent.

698
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,360
No, it's all right.
- Its network is fine everywhere.

699
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,520
Why is there a crowd?
- Let's find out.. - What!

700
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,560
Pull over.

701
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,640
Don't lie.

702
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,800
Shut up.
- We've to leave immediately.

703
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,040
I'll be right back.
Just a minute, sir.

704
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,360
I didn't do anything, sir.
We were just talking.

705
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,640
What's your relationship
with her? - Tell us.

706
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,640
You can't leave from here.

707
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,960
Josy, what happened?
- Ask him.

708
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,720
{\an8}What's your relationship
with her?

709
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,960
Let me ask.. - Sir..
- What is it?

710
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,400
My friend and I were having
a conversation inside the car.

711
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,640
Do you think I'd buy it?

712
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,440
She isn't his friend.
- It's his girlfriend. Look at her.

713
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,520
This is his so-called friend.
- Lower the window..

714
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,360
Let me see the friend.

715
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,760
You can't leave from here.
- This is his friend. - You won't.

716
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,560
What was the conversation
all about?

717
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,560
Let me explain.

718
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,960
They've been here for a while and
their behaviour was inappropriate.

719
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,280
He was the one who
noticed it first.

720
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,200
{\an8}Sir. - Where is your hometown..
- It's nearby. - Where exactly?

721
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,280
{\an8}Pala..

722
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,160
{\an8}Pala..

723
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,640
{\an8}Sir, please don't
trouble me. Please..

724
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,760
How dare you..

725
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,360
Josy, what's the matter?

726
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,520
They were
snogging in the car.

727
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,520
Oh, no!
- Stand up.

728
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,320
Get over here.
- Oh, God!

729
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,120
Leave him be.
- Don't hurt me.

730
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,720
Jithin! - Let go of me, Mr. Benny.
- Listen to me. I'll fix this.

731
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,240
I will.
- Mister..

732
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,880
Just calm down.

733
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,800
You need not interfere
in this matter, Benny.

734
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,680
Josy, let me talk.

735
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,560
Sir, please don't hit me.
Come here.

736
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,920
Sir, it's nothing.
We came here just to talk.

737
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,440
They unnecessarily created a scene.

738
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,360
Let me tell you something.
You'd not want to mess with them.

739
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,600
Don't take things
from bad to worse.

740
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,720
Sir, if you suspect me,
please call the police.

741
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,080
Let them resolve the issue.
- Mister

742
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,920
it will take them at least
two hours to reach here.

743
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,200
Are you going to make her
stay here until then?

744
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,160
Give them some money
and solve this issue.

745
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,640
I'll give you anything.
Please help me leave from here.

746
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,120
Give me the money that you've.
I'll handle the rest.

747
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,560
I don't have much money, sir.

748
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,800
Give me whatever you've.

749
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,160
Handle the issue yourself
with this money.

750
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,080
This is all I've got.

751
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,880
I don't even
have money for fuel.

752
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,640
Don't you dare come
here ever again!

753
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,400
Do you get me?
- I won't come. - Go.

754
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,800
Can I go?
- Yes.

755
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,040
Get lost!

756
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,840
Here you go.

757
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,960
Go.
- Go.

758
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,960
Leave.

759
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,160
Y-You must pay me as I
noticed it first. - Here you go.

760
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,680
That's how it should be, right?

761
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,280
W-What? This is very less.

762
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,320
It's a meagre amount.
- Get lost.. - You!

763
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,280
Get lost!

764
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,960
Don't you dare come here again!

765
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,040
She is not letting me record
a proper video.

766
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,720
You will get hit by the car. Move!

767
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,880
Such scoundrels show up here.

768
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,480
I felt sorry for her.

769
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,320
Else, I'd not have let him
get away with it.

770
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,800
Mr. Benny, God created
all these forests and mountains

771
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,160
for human beings.

772
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,960
{\an8}Sir, you're so philosophical.

773
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,680
{\an8}It's a verse
from the Bible.

774
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,200
Do you remember me, Priya Paul?

775
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,040
I studied in the class, 12 B.
My name is Josy K Baby.

776
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,880
I see.

777
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,440
When did you arrive?
- A week ago.

778
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,520
I see.
What does your husband do?

779
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,520
He was working
for an IT firm in Dubai.

780
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,560
IT industry is in decline, right?

781
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,160
I saw him on the way.

782
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,000
What do you do?

783
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,120
I run a textiles shop
in the town.

784
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,280
My family has farmed all this land.
- All right.

785
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:22,960
I'm coming.

786
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,520
Okay. Let me go inside.
I've some work to do.

787
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,600
Oh. You can contact me
if you need any help.

788
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,240
Sure.
- I'll be nearby.

789
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,960
Shall I give you
my contact number?

790
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,560
Let me.

791
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,920
You can call me up
if you need any help.

792
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,680
Okay. Thank you.

793
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,400
How did it go?
- She took my contact number.

794
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,040
She will surely call you.

795
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,360
She might be taking a shower.

796
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,720
{\an8}Hey!
You should not ogle her.

797
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,040
If you're serious about her,
we won't ogle her.

798
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,000
Johnny, haven't I
fulfilled all your wishes?

799
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,080
I'll always do.

800
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,760
You're incredible, Josy!

801
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,840
"Oh, my love!"

802
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,400
{\an8}"This song is for you."

803
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,240
{\an8}"Oh, my love.."

804
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,800
"A song from my heart.."

805
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,520
"Oh, beloved! You touched"

806
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,600
"my heart."

807
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:26,080
"You touched"

808
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,040
"my heart."

809
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,880
"Thankamma,
you eloped with a stranger.."

810
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,920
{\an8}"Are you satisfied now?"

811
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,280
"Thankamma.."

812
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,080
What happened?
- Abin, can't you hear it?

813
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,800
"You eloped with a stranger..
Are you satisfied.."

814
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,040
Use this.

815
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,520
It's not just that.

816
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,680
How dare they step into our land
and ruin our peace of mind?

817
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,120
Dear, this is a village.

818
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,680
People work till evening.

819
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,880
They then have a couple
of drinks and sing folk songs.

820
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,200
That gives them happiness.

821
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,680
This is not a folk song.

822
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,200
They are singing it to annoy me.

823
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,920
I can't tolerate it any more!

824
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:20,160
"Thankamma.."

825
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,840
"Thankamma, you
eloped with a stranger."

826
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,640
"Are you satisfied now?"

827
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,280
"Thankamma, you
eloped with a stranger."

828
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,400
"Are you satisfied now?"

829
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,680
Hey, stop it..

830
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,440
He is coming here.

831
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,760
{\an8}Sir, be careful.

832
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,320
{\an8}What's the matter?

833
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,960
{\an8}Could you please stop singing?

834
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,680
{\an8}My wife and I are working.
- He is unable to work!

835
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,360
Hey.. Shut up.

836
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,280
They are youngsters.
Just ignore them.

837
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,480
You could've said this from there.
You needn't have come here.

838
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,480
It's all right.

839
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,880
My wife has some health issues.

840
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,520
{\an8}No, sir.
We won't sing anymore.

841
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,040
{\an8}We have stopped.
- Okay. - Okay.

842
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,360
{\an8}There will soon be
a wedding in the family.

843
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,680
{\an8}That's why. Pour a drink for him.
- No..

844
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,760
{\an8}Why? Don't you drink?

845
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,960
{\an8}I..
- Have a drink before you leave.

846
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,840
{\an8}I.. - Have it.
- Have it for us.

847
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,400
{\an8}Say, 'Cheers', sir.

848
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,680
{\an8}Cheers.

849
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,400
{\an8}Would you like to have some more?
- No. This is enough.. Okay.

850
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,680
Thank you..

851
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,240
{\an8}Poor guy.

852
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,960
They got a bit carried away
with the wedding celebration.

853
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,360
So..

854
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,680
Did you drink?

855
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,800
Just one shot.

856
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,560
Why did you drink with them?

857
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,600
Abin, this isn't
Bangalore or Dubai.

858
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,560
You've no clue
about their character.

859
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,960
They stopped singing
when we asked them to.

860
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,400
So, when they offered me a drink,
I didn't feel like rejecting it.

861
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,480
What's wrong in that?

862
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:23,680
There is nothing wrong, Abin..
- Talk to me.

863
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,400
Talking to you is pointless.

864
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,560
Whatever!

865
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,840
Where is your mother?
- She has gone to work, sir.

866
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,800
How is Sandra?

867
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,800
I saw her
at Contractor Pappalli's house.

868
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,440
It's going on.

869
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:13,960
You're blushing!

870
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,640
Was yours a love marriage?
- What!

871
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,640
Was yours a love marriage?

872
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,520
Yes. It happened.

873
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,560
Okay, sir. I'm leaving.
I've to attend the class.

874
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,480
Are you really
going to the class?

875
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,600
Yes..

876
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,520
Priya!

877
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,160
What are you doing?

878
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,040
Step back.
- Move aside. Priya!

879
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,560
Whose mobile phone is this?

880
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,360
Whose mobile phone is this?

881
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,920
I got this from the bathroom.

882
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,480
Bathroom?
Who would keep it there?

883
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,640
Priya.

884
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,280
Hey, what are you doing? Get up.

885
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,720
Move aside, Abin.

886
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,600
I've no peace of mind
since I came here.

887
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,840
What are you looking for?

888
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,080
Whom are you calling up?
- Abin, just a minute.

889
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,400
Just a minute, Abin.

890
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,120
This is Josy's mobile phone.

891
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,680
Abin, I know them
since my school days.

892
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,720
They are scoundrels!

893
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,920
I know how to handle it.
- Hey, what are you doing?

894
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,160
Abin..
- Sit here.

895
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,680
Let us calmly talk and decide.

896
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:09,600
None of them should enter
our property hereafter.

897
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,280
We're cancelling the contract.

898
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,120
Abin, I don't want to feel so
scared in my own house.

899
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,360
I can't even use
the bathroom peacefully.

900
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,120
Relax.

901
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,480
I'll talk to them.

902
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,120
It might be a misunderstanding.

903
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,040
Josy.
- Yes.

904
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,560
Is this your mobile phone?
- Yes.

905
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,720
How did this break?

906
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,840
I'd given it to Biju
for repairing its display.

907
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,400
Who broke it?

908
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,640
What's the issue, Uncle?
- Go inside.

909
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,480
Eat something
and go to the church.

910
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,600
I shouldn't have given
it to a moron like him.

911
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,440
I told you, right?

912
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,840
Our boys won't do that.

913
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,360
You brat!
- What is it?

914
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,960
I'm sure.
- What!

915
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,960
You'd kept the phone there.

916
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,720
Show it to me as well.

917
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,960
Hey..

918
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,560
Just leave it be.

919
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,120
As for the contract

920
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,800
you can't cancel
it just like that.

921
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,640
Definitely not for
such trivial issues.

922
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:55,120
But I'll warn the boys
to not trouble you

923
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,600
when they enter your property.

924
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,760
Isn't that enough?

925
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,960
You may please leave, sir.

926
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,840
The wedding is on the horizon.

927
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,600
We're busy making
its arrangements.

928
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,400
And one more thing, sir.

929
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,480
This is a village.

930
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,080
It has its own rules.

931
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,360
Your wife and you should
keep that in mind.

932
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,160
All right then.

933
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,400
You're leaving, right?

934
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,240
How long is your leave, Mr. Baby?

935
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,400
Were the problems of
the area sorted out?

936
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:30,880
No, not at all.

937
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,520
We can resolve all the issues if
we're given complete freedom

938
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,960
for two days.

939
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,400
What's the matter,
Brother-in-law?

940
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,720
Some people are keen on
wasting others' time.

941
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,240
Abin, what happened?

942
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,880
That was just a confusion.

943
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,920
He had given his
mobile phone for repair.

944
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,200
Abin, I've got no confusion
regarding this.

945
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,160
Abin, don't be so naive.

946
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,800
It wasn't the right time to talk

947
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,080
even if he were responsible.

948
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,080
They were busy with the wedding
of his eldest daughter.

949
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,520
Sandra's elder sister's wedding.

950
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,560
You need not do anything, Abin.

951
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,960
You haven't understood it.

952
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,400
I explained everything
to the contractor.

953
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,600
He promised me that
they won't trouble us.

954
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,960
Abin, I'm not interested
in listening to this.

955
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,400
Why are you worrying so much?

956
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,320
We could always
approach the police.

957
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,240
If they trouble us anymore,
we'll handle them legally.

958
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:41,680
Did you eat anything?

959
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:46,280
Come. Let's eat something.
Come, dear.

960
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:58,360
Shall we go for a drive
to Kottayam day after tomorrow?

961
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,840
Is it for meeting Thomas?

962
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,160
Yes, he is free.

963
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,920
No, Abin. I've some
urgent work to finish.

964
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,960
The deadline is already over.

965
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,800
But I won't stay here alone.

966
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,920
I'll go to the convent's library.

967
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,560
Are you sure?
- Yes.

968
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,560
You can go without any worries.

969
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,240
You guys will be
discussing business.

970
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,480
What will I do there?

971
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,000
You could've woken me up.

972
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,520
I didn't want to.

973
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,360
What would you do
waking up so early?

974
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,360
Am I looking fine?

975
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:18,560
Awesome.

976
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,640
Shall I leave?
- Okay.

977
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,760
How will you go
to the convent?

978
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,960
On my dad's scooter.
- Okay.

979
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,320
Call up Mr. Benny
if you need any help.

980
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,760
I'll call you
before I start from there.

981
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,920
Okay. All the best.
- Thank you. Take care.

982
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,320
I know that you're
angry with me.

983
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,160
I wanted to tell you
something personally.

984
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,880
There shouldn't be any
misunderstanding between us.

985
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,920
Okay, bye.

986
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,280
Ms. Priya, don't close the door.

987
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,160
I got to know about it
when my uncle informed me.

988
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,720
I'd really given that phone
for repair at Biju's shop.

989
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,800
Ask Johnny if you think
that I'm lying.

990
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,080
You should leave.
My husband is not here.

991
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,720
I've nothing to talk to you.

992
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:10,720
How dare you!

993
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,680
Didn't Josy tell you
that he is innocent?

994
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,720
Johnny, no.
Since Ms. Priya has said..

995
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,640
I've nothing to talk to you.

996
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:25,000
{\an8}'Pappalli's.'

997
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,280
Pull over.

998
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,280
What happened?
- Reverse the car.

999
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,320
Come.
- What's the matter?

1000
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,480
Just come.

1001
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,440
Hey!
- J-Josy..

1002
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,760
Josy.. Please..
- Let go of me.

1003
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,360
Don't hit him.
- Come here.

1004
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:01,600
Come here!
- Listen to me.

1005
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,120
Josy, let go of him.

1006
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,480
Take her. - Brother.
- Come. - You!

1007
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,320
Brother.
- Don't beat me up, sir.

1008
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,960
Listen to me, Brother.

1009
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:17,360
Brother, stop. - You!
- Don't beat him up. - Stop..

1010
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,520
No. Come, Johnny..
- Don't hit him, Brother.

1011
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:27,080
Hey. Come here.

1012
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:29,360
Come here.

1013
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,200
Hey.. We shall deal with him
later. Come, Jithin.

1014
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,920
Priya..

1015
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,520
Priya.

1016
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,960
'The number that you're trying
to reach is not responding.'

1017
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,160
'Please try again later.'

1018
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,360
'The number that you're trying
to reach is not responding.'

1019
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,160
'Please try again later.'

1020
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,400
What happened? - Nothing serious.
She met with a minor accident.

1021
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,800
She is fine as someone
brought her here on time.

1022
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,080
You need not worry.

1023
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,840
Where is she?
- There.

1024
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,200
Doctor, this is Abin.
He is her husband.

1025
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,520
There is nothing to worry.
She just has a few minor injuries.

1026
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,040
She is still in shock
of the accident.

1027
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,360
She was crying profusely
to go home.

1028
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,080
Are you done dressing
the wounds, Nurse? - Yes.

1029
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,560
Did you get scared?

1030
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,320
There is nothing to worry.

1031
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,120
You can take her home
after buying these medicines.

1032
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:27,040
Priya.

1033
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:31,960
Priya.

1034
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,160
What happened?

1035
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,320
Priya.

1036
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,720
Stop.

1037
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:18,960
Don't you want the key?

1038
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:20,920
Priya.

1039
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:32,840
Priya.

1040
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:38,680
Priya..

1041
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:40,400
Priya.

1042
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,360
Priya.

1043
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,240
Priya.

1044
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:48,920
What are you doing?

1045
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,080
I'm talking to you.

1046
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,440
Abin, go out.

1047
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,320
Tell me the matter.
- For what?

1048
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,160
I told you
umpteen number of times.

1049
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,680
You can't do anything, Abin.
- What did I do?

1050
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,240
You never did anything.

1051
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:04,600
They know very well
that you won't react.

1052
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,920
They are the ones who left me
in the hospital in the evening.

1053
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,760
You won't understand the abuse

1054
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,840
and the violence
that I had suffered today.

1055
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,280
We can't ignore this any more.

1056
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,720
Come. Let's go
to the police station.

1057
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,760
We've to register
a complaint. - For what?

1058
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,600
I don't want to be the victim
of verbal abuse as well.

1059
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,920
There is no evidence
that I was hit by their vehicle.

1060
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,120
No one saw them
leaving me in the hospital.

1061
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,960
Who'd then believe me
if I say that they did it?

1062
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,160
They will say
that I'm being delusional.

1063
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,760
I know that no one
will be there by my side.

1064
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:48,240
But deep inside.. I know
what happened to me.

1065
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,440
Abin, don't touch me today.

1066
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,360
I don't think I can live here
safely with you.

1067
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,040
I don't think I'd be safe
with you anywhere.

1068
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,760
This wouldn't have happened
to me if my dad was alive.

1069
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,040
Priya.

1070
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:21,280
Abin, please leave
me alone. Just leave.

1071
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,480
Sir..

1072
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:46,600
Who is it?

1073
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:48,640
Sir..

1074
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:51,960
Sir, can you take us
to the police station?

1075
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,320
Please sit.

1076
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:55,920
What happened?

1077
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,440
Sandra and I were
talking to each other.

1078
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:00,920
Mr. Josy and the others saw us.

1079
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:02,600
They took her.

1080
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,440
They thrashed me severely.

1081
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:07,320
Mr. Murugan told us

1082
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,520
that if they see him,
they won't spare him.

1083
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,920
They are looking for him, sir.

1084
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,560
It's them, sir.
- Go inside.

1085
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,280
Go inside.

1086
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,400
Why are you standing outside, sir?

1087
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,720
Did your wife kick
you out of the house!

1088
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,080
I just wanted
some fresh air.

1089
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,240
Did that boy, who
supplies milk, come here?

1090
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:03,680
No.

1091
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,280
I saw him
entering your compound.

1092
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:09,000
I didn't see him.

1093
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,960
Inform us if you see him.
- Okay.

1094
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,400
{\an8}Let us take your leave.

1095
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:12,760
Brother, it was obvious from his
demeanour that they were inside.

1096
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:14,280
This is his slipper.

1097
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,840
You could've dragged
him outside, right?

1098
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:18,160
You brat! I've told you
not to interrupt me

1099
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,960
while I'm talking to my brother.
Don't try to act smart!

1100
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,640
Oh, God! Can you guys stop?

1101
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,840
Give me some peace of mind.

1102
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,320
I'll handle this.

1103
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:26,960
Johnny, keep quiet.

1104
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,680
{\an8}Sir, let me come to the point.

1105
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,280
{\an8}Send that milkmaid
and her son with us.

1106
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,720
{\an8}He has done
something unforgivable.

1107
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,600
{\an8}I'll take them to the police
station tomorrow morning.

1108
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,640
{\an8}We can settle the issue there.
- You needn't do anything!

1109
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,600
Don't act like you're his
father and shelter them!

1110
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,160
Calm down.
- Brother-in-law Baby

1111
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,400
I had asked him politely.

1112
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,760
But he lied to me then.

1113
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:11,840
Leave it be.

1114
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,160
{\an8}Sir, a wedding is going
to happen in our family.

1115
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,520
These kinds of incidents
will defame us.

1116
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,360
Call them.
We'll talk to him.

1117
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,840
We didn't come here
to invite you to the wedding.

1118
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,280
There is a proverb.

1119
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,680
You might not have heard it.

1120
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,360
{\an8}'One must not feed a stray dog.'
- Shut up!

1121
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,920
{\an8}How dare you raise your
voice at my home!

1122
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,000
{\an8}No matter what, I won't
let you take them tonight.

1123
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:31,480
I'll handle you alone.

1124
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,320
Let's not waste time
talking to this scoundrel.

1125
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,520
Go inside and bring them.

1126
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,600
This is not your home to barge in
when your dad asks you to!

1127
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,960
I won't let anyone enter
my house and take them!

1128
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,360
Stay in that room.

1129
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:26,640
Dear, don't cry.
- Don't cry.

1130
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,000
Just shut up.

1131
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,440
Sabu, bring a cloth immediately.

1132
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,600
Hold his hand.

1133
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,120
Dad, do it carefully.

1134
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,200
Brother, we shouldn't spare him.

1135
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,120
We must chop him into pieces!

1136
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,480
I won't spare him
as he has injured my son.

1137
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:02,880
We'll leave only
after murdering him!

1138
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,160
Mark my words!

1139
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,560
Break the door. - Come. - Take
all the weapons from the jeep.

1140
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,520
Brother.

1141
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,880
Kunjimon. Hey.

1142
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,080
I suffered an electric shock. Drat!

1143
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,360
There.

1144
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:51,200
Brother, here you go.

1145
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,400
Let's see how long
they could stay inside the house.

1146
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:56,800
Brother-in-law,
give that to me.

1147
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,520
Josy, disconnect the internet
and phone cable.

1148
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,280
No one should find out
even if they die.

1149
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:03,840
Sabu, come.
- Come..

1150
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,320
You were wrong when you said
he is good-for-nothing.

1151
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,720
They won't escape
from this house, Johnny.

1152
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:25,800
Just wait and watch.

1153
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:04,880
Kick it.
- You!

1154
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:08,400
Hey! Open it.

1155
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:40,400
Brother-in-law, what was he
doing in Dubai? - I don't know.

1156
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,520
Josy, reverse the jeep.

1157
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,720
Why did they come here?

1158
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,480
I've no clue, Baby.

1159
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,960
Don't touch the door..
You'll suffer an electric shock.

1160
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:05,840
Break the door with a log.

1161
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,880
Let's first move him.

1162
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:09,680
Kunjimon, come.

1163
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,000
Careful..

1164
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:16,640
Make him sit on the sofa.

1165
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:18,800
Careful..

1166
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:20,800
Slowly.

1167
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,920
Hit it with more force!

1168
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:20,400
What's the matter, sir?

1169
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:22,920
The police?

1170
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:26,280
Yes, sir.

1171
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,000
Don't open the door
no matter what happens outside.

1172
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:35,640
Abin.
- Don't worry.

1173
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,200
Nothing untoward will happen to us.

1174
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:43,880
Close the door.

1175
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:16,520
Uncle.
- Dad.

1176
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:29,720
Don't spare him.

1177
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,680
I reckon he
is a Maoist or terrorist.

1178
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:37,160
You scoundrel!

1179
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:39,560
Come out if you've the guts!

1180
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:17,200
You..

1181
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:24,080
Bring him!

1182
01:57:58,280 --> 01:57:59,360
You could leave.

1183
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:01,480
Someone else is on
the way to take them.

1184
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:06,720
Come, Brother-in-law.

1185
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,480
Don't be scared.
Nothing bad will happen.

1186
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,240
Hey!

1187
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:35,320
Don't forget to bring
the milk in the evening.

1188
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,040
Try entering my house.

1189
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:05,480
Neither the police nor
the army could sue me.

1190
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,360
You are unfortunate

1191
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:10,200
that there are laws
that would acquit me.

1192
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:09,160
"Until the fire burns out.."

1193
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:16,880
"Until the pain fades away.."

1194
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:26,400
"I'll always be there
with you like your shadow"

1195
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:32,840
"and you'll always be there
with me like the sunlight"

1196
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:38,200
"to protect each other."

1197
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:43,880
"And this journey will continue."

1198
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:20,760
{\an8}"This world is so
desolate and violent."

1199
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:28,960
{\an8}"And we are trapped
in one of its cages."

1200
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:37,920
{\an8}"We crossed yesterday
and reached today."

1201
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:46,200
{\an8}"We're searching for tomorrow."

1202
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:54,480
{\an8}"Every breath will
become a reincarnation."

1203
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:16,000
{\an8}"Until the fire burns out.."

1204
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:24,440
{\an8}"Until the pain fades away.."

1205
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:33,400
{\an8}"I'll always be there
with you like your shadow"

1206
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:40,720
{\an8}"and you'll always be there
with me like the sunlight"

1207
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:45,080
{\an8}"to protect each other."

1208
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:50,600
{\an8}"And this journey
will continue."
