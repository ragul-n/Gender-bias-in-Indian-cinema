00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,240
'Famous mountains like Brahma Mountain,

2
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,479
Pushpa Mountain and
Kodachadri Mountain of Karnataka,

3
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:12,676
Aadi Kaleshwar Mountain is one of them.'

4
00:01:12,892 --> 00:01:16,122
'Though the mountain is surrounded
by the five elements,

5
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,522
it is hardly visited by people.'

6
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:23,348
Thakome, the king of Mongolia
from Ulaanbaatar

7
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:26,313
who came to South of India in 1940
for business,

8
00:01:26,393 --> 00:01:29,173
since he had good relationship
with the Britishers,

9
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,920
the British government presented a huge
bungalow to him as a token of friendship.'

10
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:37,348
'A sorcerer of the region who had
an eye on the king's wealth

11
00:01:37,428 --> 00:01:39,389
married the king by luring him.'

12
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:43,090
'Whenever the king went
to Ulaanbaatar for business

13
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,387
she'd send for his ex-lover to her place.'
Getting engrossed into his arms,

14
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:50,633
she gives birth to a baby boy.'

15
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:55,009
'This secret which was kept away
from the king for seven years,

16
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:56,954
when he learnt about it,

17
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,838
he not only burnt the
illegitimate child alive

18
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:03,260
and got her lover killed,

19
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,783
he also ordered to beat the
sorcerer to death as a punishment

20
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:09,452
and goes to his native.'

21
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:12,151
Pained about losing her child

22
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:15,446
and parting from her lover,

23
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:18,136
on a full moon day,

24
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:22,417
she gave up her soul
to an evil and died.'

25
00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:26,615
'On the other side, pained about
the incident, he commits suicide.'

26
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:35,321
'When the king's dynasty
was coming to end gradually,

27
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:40,337
the monks believed the curse of
the sorcerer to be the reason behind it

28
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:42,889
and sent Monk Mojimur

29
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:45,633
to Aadi Kaleshwar Mountain.'

30
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:06,074
Monk, I was terrified as soon as

31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,098
you asked me about the bungalow.

32
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:11,497
Whichever animal goes
towards the bungalow,

33
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:13,408
the ghost kills it for sure.

34
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:17,050
The villagers have never been
to the bungalow for the past 40 years.

35
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,541
Look there, that's the bungalow.

36
00:04:47,582 --> 00:04:51,051
It is not so easy
to confine the evil force

37
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:54,147
which gave up its soul to an evil.'

38
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:58,921
It is very important to confine it
only on a particular period.

39
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:04,187
I will definitely come on that particular
day and bring peace to that soul.

40
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,105
I taught stunts to great actors like
Dr. Rajkumar,

41
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:41,447
Vishnuwadhan, Ambrish

42
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:44,424
and the karate king.

43
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,222
Do you know how I won these trophies?
- He got them from the scrap dealer.

44
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:51,811
Shut up! I don't stoop so low.

45
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,166
Have you ever done somersault?

46
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:56,930
What's the big deal, Brother-in-law?

47
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,274
I have failed in all the exams.

48
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:02,344
Have you ever kicked anyone?

49
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:04,870
If you don't water or soda to your drink

50
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,871
you will definitely go high,
Brother-in-law.

51
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:11,149
You must have guts to
become a stunt master like me.

52
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,207
Do you have it?
- I do have a cigarette.

53
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,508
Do you have matchbox on you?
- You stole my cigarette!

54
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:17,531
Give it back!
- Dad!

55
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:20,830
We know you're former stunt man.
Why do you throw your weight on uncle?

56
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,329
Nephew, don't call me 'Mama' (uncle),
call me 'Maava' (uncle).

57
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:24,226
Gani!
- Yes.

58
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:25,870
Bring Pratap here.

59
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,767
Come, Uncle.
- I am going as he's calling me.

60
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,410
Don't try to act smart with me.
- Here he is.

61
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,355
Pratap, we got you an
auto rickshaw to do business,

62
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:36,128
how you make me do this work?

63
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,576
Look, I have to go to collect
the interest money for chit fund.

64
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:40,806
What do you think you're doing?

65
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:44,343
Your husband is not allowing me to go.
- Uncle, go to Hotel Deepak

66
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:47,232
and deliver four diamonds,
six gold and three silver.

67
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,779
Do it.
- Okay.

68
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:51,287
The brand names for the
products are gold and silver,

69
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:53,623
but we could never buy real
gold and silver selling them.

70
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:56,856
Hey, I am the golden star.
- Gani!

71
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,880
Which star?
- The golden star.

72
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,951
You're not a star, you're like
the tar on the road. - Dad, go away,

73
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:03,930
else she will throw chilli powder
on your face. - My God!

74
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,015
Brother-in-law,
don't turn around, get going.

75
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:54,696
Thank you.

76
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:57,983
Thanks.

77
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:02,696
Rani, you're getting
call from an unknown number.

78
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,128
Hello.
- It's me Nimmi.

79
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,460
When did you purchase a new number?

80
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,259
I will tell you later.

81
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,017
Is there a lake or
a well in your locality?

82
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:16,153
To bid farewell to Lord Ganesha's idol.
- No, to kill myself.

83
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:19,103
What's the wrong with you?
- I was dating a guy.

84
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:21,179
'You were dating a guy?'
- Yes. - 'You didn't tell me about it.'

85
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:23,885
I wanted to surprise you.

86
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:26,082
It's all over.

87
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:28,271
'What happened?'

88
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:30,630
His father learnt about our relationship

89
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,612
and looking for an alliance.

90
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:36,642
I already slept with him.

91
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,272
Darn it.
- He has now decided

92
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:42,212
to marry another girl
as he doesn't want to hurt his father.

93
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:44,140
Do this.

94
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:46,326
Tell your boyfriend you want
to meet him for the last time,

95
00:12:46,406 --> 00:12:50,280
ask him to come to
Vaishnavi Sapphire Mall in blue t-shirt.

96
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,182
Where did uncle go?
He said there's a sale.

97
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:06,678
Hi.
- Nimmi, will he come?

98
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:24,175
Rani. - Yes.
- He has come.

99
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:26,821
Is it? Is he downstairs?

100
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,609
'He's so handsome.'

101
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:43,288
How does he look?

102
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,243
Is it him? - Yeah.
- He's very handsome.

103
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:49,066
Oh, he's leaving. Let's go.
- Come.

104
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,881
Hey, here you are.
I was looking for you.

105
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,645
My friends were waiting for you.

106
00:13:57,725 --> 00:14:00,907
Were your friends...
- I am in a fix. Let's go.

107
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:03,977
Just a minute. They...
- Forget them.

108
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:14,372
Don't talk.

109
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:19,345
Where is he going?
- Where did he go?

110
00:14:20,504 --> 00:14:21,438
Fourth floor.

111
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:27,881
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

112
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:29,360
Which perfume do you use?

113
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:32,111
Perfume? No, I don't use perfumes.

114
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,259
Sir, it's a special perfume, please try.
It's a sample, sir.

115
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,292
Is it?
- It's a very special perfume.

116
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:39,939
Let me try.

117
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:47,126
Very nice. It's very nice.

118
00:14:57,495 --> 00:15:00,141
Yes!
- It's very nice.

119
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,396
Give me more.

120
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:13,729
Yes!

121
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:25,508
Where am I?

122
00:15:27,723 --> 00:15:29,634
Where am I?

123
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:31,641
Where am I?

124
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,824
Hello, you're such a cheat.

125
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:38,075
Times have changed now.

126
00:15:51,004 --> 00:15:52,137
What are you watching?

127
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,386
I am wondering if you girls kidnapped me

128
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:57,188
to beat me or romance with me.

129
00:15:57,534 --> 00:16:00,310
Did the spray work on him or not?
He regained consciousness so soon.

130
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,804
I don't fall unconscious
for Bangalore's pollution,

131
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:06,538
you think I will fall unconscious
for the spray?

132
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:08,934
What a joke!

133
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:12,272
Hey, don't laugh. Do you think
your heart is ladies paying guest?

134
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,356
For how many girls
will you rent your heart?

135
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:17,547
You fell in love with our friend Nimmi,
made her pregnant

136
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:19,303
and now you're getting
married to another girl.

137
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:21,707
I didn't make Nimmi pregnant.

138
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:24,293
First of all,
I don't even know who Nimmi is.

139
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:26,290
Really? You don't know who Nimmi is?
- No, I don't.

140
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,767
You don't know how dangerous I am.

141
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:32,205
Do that again.
- What?

142
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:34,433
Look,

143
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,512
young ladies should
cook food and not lock horns

144
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:40,811
with young men.

145
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:43,855
By the way, what is your name?
- Don't tell him your name, Rani.

146
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,021
Rani, what is your name?

147
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:51,207
Rani, Nimmi is calling.

148
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:53,740
Hello, Nimmi,
where did you go away suddenly?

149
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,144
My boyfriend came and picked me.

150
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,202
We're going to Daramasthala
to get married.

151
00:16:58,282 --> 00:17:01,757
Hey, hold on, I'll put Rani on the line.
Rani, Nimmi wants to talk to you.

152
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:06,037
Tell me.
- 'My boyfriend patched up with me,

153
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:08,917
we're going to Daramasthala
to get married. Bye.'

154
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:10,189
Idiot!

155
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:12,871
I have kidnapped your boyfriend.

156
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:16,797
You have no patience.
You must've kidnapped somebody else.

157
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:19,375
Hang up the phone.
- 'Okay.'

158
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,140
Rani, did you goof up?

159
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,895
We got confused and made a mistake.

160
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:29,495
You may go.
- Hello.

161
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:33,248
You kidnapped an innocent guy and now,

162
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,082
you say it was a blunder

163
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:37,564
and ask me to leave.

164
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:39,051
I won't be quiet.

165
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:41,360
If I get angry...

166
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,072
Are you threatening me?

167
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:44,794
Nothing wrong happened.

168
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:49,161
What do you mean,
'nothing wrong happened'?

169
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:54,142
What if someone filmed you
girls kidnapping an young man like me

170
00:17:54,222 --> 00:17:58,984
in broad daylight and post the video
on social network and it becomes viral,

171
00:17:59,064 --> 00:18:01,209
who will marry me?

172
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,378
When engineers have a tough time
finding brides,

173
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,350
who will marry a man
who was kidnapped?

174
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:11,613
I don't mind jumping off
the mountain with my girlfriend

175
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:13,793
to commit suicide,

176
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,892
but I won't die as a bachelor.

177
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:24,483
Soon after I grew up, my parents
desired to have

178
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,961
a beautiful daughter-in-law.

179
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,758
Now, who will agree to become
daughter-in-law to my parents?

180
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,196
Who?
- I will become their daughter-in-law.

181
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:36,929
Sister.
- Idiot!

182
00:18:39,238 --> 00:18:42,265
You're laughing?
I have become a mockery.

183
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:45,180
You ruined my life
trying to help your friend.

184
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,826
Isn't there anyone to raise
voice against the injustice?

185
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:53,281
I want to cry,
but I am unable to do so.

186
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:56,794
Will you stop this nonsense?
- Just shut up!

187
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:58,054
If you were kidnapped,

188
00:18:58,134 --> 00:19:00,729
you would've created ruckus

189
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,467
before the media

190
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:04,404
and my life would've got ruined.

191
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:06,739
Don't you think men and women are equal?

192
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,589
My God!

193
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:11,140
I am sorry about what happened.

194
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:13,234
Please go from here.

195
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:17,991
I won't allow you to go.

196
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:20,653
I told you I am sorry.
- That's not enough.

197
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,444
You have to apologise to me
by falling at my feet.

198
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,837
Sister.
- Do what he says.

199
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:29,907
No, don't.

200
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,884
I was kidding.

201
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:33,495
The place of a girl is not at the feet,

202
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,321
but in the heart.

203
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:53,389
Hey girl,

204
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:55,603
we have seen boys kidnap girls,

205
00:19:55,683 --> 00:19:58,604
for the first time I am seeing
girls kidnap boys.

206
00:19:58,684 --> 00:20:03,066
Look, you must give a share
from the ransom to our boss.

207
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:04,726
Which ransom?

208
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:07,961
Seeing your attire and the location,

209
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:09,847
you're no less than James Bond.

210
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:11,853
You're mistaken.

211
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:14,967
Run!

212
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:18,115
Catch them!

213
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,567
Hey!

214
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:25,260
Stop!

215
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:07,562
Rani, he has taken risk for us,
thank him.

216
00:22:07,642 --> 00:22:10,643
That's alright.
I didn't exercise this morning,

217
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:12,147
it was like a warm-up.

218
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:13,325
Thanks, ma'am.

219
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:16,676
At times, even strangers
help you when you're in trouble,

220
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,849
they alert you when the
vehicle stand is not closed

221
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:21,270
or the car door is not closed properly.

222
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:24,720
So what's the need to thank him
for such a little thing?

223
00:22:25,638 --> 00:22:27,033
Come, let's go.

224
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:29,066
You can't get away.

225
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:42,990
Gani, it's as big as a truck.

226
00:22:43,357 --> 00:22:45,270
Sir, are you very tired?
- Yes.

227
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,984
Ask for a ride on his back.
- What?

228
00:22:48,686 --> 00:22:50,340
Spoilt brats.

229
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,332
Look at him,
he is jogging wearing a suit.

230
00:22:54,412 --> 00:22:57,090
He's straight here
from the last night party.

231
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:59,421
Pull his leg.

232
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:02,751
Hey! Who's that?

233
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:09,043
My girlfriend.
Hello, sweetheart. Morning!

234
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,109
Even I am in the park.

235
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:13,325
Is it? I am coming!

236
00:23:14,163 --> 00:23:15,595
Bye, Gani.

237
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:18,514
Let me know when you get her.

238
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:21,065
He's pimp. Let's borrow his number.

239
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:23,184
Excuse me!

240
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,779
Hello. Buddy,

241
00:23:40,482 --> 00:23:43,919
you were worried because
traffic police seized your bike,

242
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,422
but my situation was worse,

243
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:47,995
I was kidnapped

244
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,470
by some girls yesterday.

245
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:53,638
Be careful, don't move around alone.

246
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:57,357
If something goes wrong, call me,

247
00:23:57,724 --> 00:24:00,189
I will come for your rescue.

248
00:24:01,054 --> 00:24:04,157
Hello, don't get scared of boys.

249
00:24:04,654 --> 00:24:08,178
We girls are usually polite, but if
someone messes with us, they are finished.

250
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:10,968
No man has the courage

251
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:12,816
to confront us.
- Hey!

252
00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:15,551
It is men who represent courage.

253
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:19,075
If girls are queen of wars,
boys are king of the jungle.

254
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:20,826
Lion!

255
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:27,691
What will the boys do if we girls
refuse to marry them?

256
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:30,491
If boys make up their mind,

257
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:32,794
we are able to even
drag a lion with a rope,

258
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:35,345
won't we be able to drag girls
with just a string?

259
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:37,324
Don't worry at all.

260
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:39,594
Hello, mister, what's your problem?

261
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:42,556
What, Rani?
- Nothing.

262
00:24:42,636 --> 00:24:45,183
You've been degrading girls.

263
00:24:45,464 --> 00:24:46,341
You'll pay a price for it.

264
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:48,339
Hello, I'm talking over the phone.
What's your problem?

265
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:51,495
Don't make me angry, if I get angry,
I'll become like Goddess Kali.

266
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:53,399
Not Goddess Kali, but a hen.

267
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:56,155
No matter how much the hen flies,
it won't become a king,

268
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,068
it will only turn into a dish.
- Just shut up!

269
00:24:58,555 --> 00:25:00,641
Why should I shut up?

270
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:04,188
You're a girl who's good for nothing.

271
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:05,193
Mind your language!

272
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:07,723
First language is Kannada.
Kannada is the best.

273
00:25:07,803 --> 00:25:08,595
Speak in Kannada.

274
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,236
Oh! Just go to hell!
- What's going on?

275
00:25:11,316 --> 00:25:12,728
Ma'am, this is public place.

276
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:15,593
That's what even I am telling her.

277
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:17,734
I'm telling her not to quarrel in public

278
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:20,577
and sort things at home,
but she isn't paying heed to me.

279
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:23,301
What? At home?

280
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,031
What nonsense!

281
00:25:25,111 --> 00:25:26,696
I don't know who you are.

282
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,491
This is the problem, sir.

283
00:25:28,686 --> 00:25:30,426
We're married for three years now,

284
00:25:30,794 --> 00:25:32,405
she refuses to wear nuptial chain.

285
00:25:32,485 --> 00:25:34,210
She says I am not her husband.

286
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:36,735
I have become miserable after marriage.

287
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:39,572
What are you saying? Does one face
so many problems in married life?

288
00:25:40,113 --> 00:25:41,507
That's right, sir.

289
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:45,313
We can impress anyone in
this world except two people.

290
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:48,110
Your boss in the office

291
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,567
and your wife back at home.

292
00:25:50,772 --> 00:25:53,390
Whatever we do,
they try to prove it wrong.

293
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,545
Is it?
- Yes.

294
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:58,113
What is opposite word to Google?
- What is it?

295
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,491
Wife.
- How?

296
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:04,390
Google provides answers
to all our question

297
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,189
and a wife poses questions
to all our answers.

298
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:10,665
Well said!
- Stop it!

299
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:16,395
Men fear to clap hands or knock the door

300
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,688
or to go inside the room and...

301
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:22,770
Look, lives of men is miserable.

302
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,974
Hey, this is too much!
I will call the police!

303
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:30,763
Call the police, I will tell them
you kidnapped me yesterday.

304
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:31,746
Call the police!

305
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:33,735
Call the police!

306
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:36,838
Let's not land ourselves
into trouble, let's go.

307
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:41,722
Did you see?

308
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,162
When there's entertainment,
there's everybody,

309
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:48,394
but when there's trouble,
everyone is gone.

310
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:51,086
May there be joy or sorrow,

311
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:53,465
I will always be with you.

312
00:26:54,773 --> 00:27:00,287
Your father might have raised
you as a princess in the house,

313
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:04,265
but I will treat you like a queen

314
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:07,693
in my palace called heart.

315
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:11,325
Stop pretending.

316
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:15,250
At least now, tell me you love me.

317
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:21,012
I am doing so ever
since I first saw you.

318
00:27:22,082 --> 00:27:23,795
Love at first sight.

319
00:29:54,081 --> 00:29:57,497
'The no moon day is when the sun
and the moon come to the same position.'

320
00:29:57,973 --> 00:30:00,470
'Moreover, it's new moon day today.'

321
00:30:00,664 --> 00:30:04,421
'Today is the right day to confine

322
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:08,080
the evil power with my powers.'

323
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:16,016
Priest, I am getting very scared.

324
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:16,966
Guru!

325
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:31,949
Rani, come with me.
- One second. - Okay.

326
00:31:54,889 --> 00:31:57,700
Nothing should stop me
from enjoying myself.

327
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:01,944
What are you seeing?

328
00:32:02,024 --> 00:32:04,975
No one can see all the
beauties of the world at a time.

329
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:10,078
My God! - But when I see you, I felt
as though all the beauties at a time.

330
00:32:11,851 --> 00:32:13,699
Thank you.
- What is he

331
00:32:14,748 --> 00:32:15,905
doing with Rani?

332
00:32:15,985 --> 00:32:21,250
Your beautiful cheeks.

333
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,153
But

334
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:30,521
there's one ornament missing.

335
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:32,769
What's that?

336
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,981
The pearl necklace.

337
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:36,729
I don't have one.

338
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,618
I will give you one.

339
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:49,343
Hey, someone will see us.
- Who is he?

340
00:32:56,878 --> 00:32:58,533
Ma'am.
- Yes.

341
00:32:58,613 --> 00:33:00,641
Do you know him?

342
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:07,614
That boy? - Yes.
- He's the only son of Mr. Kapoor.

343
00:33:08,577 --> 00:33:11,136
He's the heir of the
wealth worth billions.

344
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,908
Hello.
- Buddy, what about Mr. Shetty's order?

345
00:33:18,557 --> 00:33:19,800
'What was the order?'

346
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:24,520
Gold, 18 boxes, four diamonds

347
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,482
and silver as per the demand.

348
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:31,379
And for the orphanage annual function,

349
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:34,564
four boxes of gold,
two diamonds.

350
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:36,795
'Okay.'
- Deliver them within half hour.

351
00:33:37,087 --> 00:33:38,141
'Okay.'
- Don't forget.

352
00:33:38,221 --> 00:33:39,141
'Okay.'
- Okay.

353
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:40,741
'Okay.'
- What?

354
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:44,672
He's donating four boxes of gold

355
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:47,552
and two diamonds to the orphanage?

356
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,963
He is a big shot.

357
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:58,449
He made a deal worth billions
over the phone in just two minutes.

358
00:33:58,773 --> 00:33:59,789
He is a big shot.

359
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:05,584
You think I will let you go
if you invite me for an unknown wedding?

360
00:34:05,664 --> 00:34:06,806
So what?

361
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:08,396
I will introduce Nimmi to you.

362
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:12,612
Our love story started
when we tried to help them.

363
00:34:13,196 --> 00:34:15,251
Is it going to be just a love story?

364
00:34:15,532 --> 00:34:16,937
Won't there be romance?

365
00:34:17,017 --> 00:34:19,261
Rani! What's happening here?

366
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:20,915
Father-in-law,

367
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,737
who do you think he is?
- Who is he?

368
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:27,154
He's the only heir of Kapoor family.

369
00:34:27,856 --> 00:34:29,916
Mr. Kapoor?
- Yes.

370
00:34:29,996 --> 00:34:31,380
The little boy?
- Yeah.

371
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,685
Is he your father?

372
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:35,089
He's the heir of the
wealth worth billions.

373
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:37,603
He's a perfect match for Rani,
you idiot!

374
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:40,840
Hey! - Sorry! When a fool like me
can realize, why can't you?

375
00:34:41,187 --> 00:34:45,122
Don't wait. Don't miss the opportunity.
- Okay.

376
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:51,197
Boy, are you in love
with my daughter?

377
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,825
Yes, sir.

378
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:00,203
Yes, Dad.

379
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:05,446
Anyways, bring your parents home,

380
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:07,025
we'll discuss about marriage.

381
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,620
Thanks, Dad.
- Oh, my darling.

382
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:23,740
Father-in-law!

383
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,859
What's the matter?
I was in the bathroom!

384
00:35:25,939 --> 00:35:30,096
Father-in-law, shall I cover
all our cars with tarpaulin?

385
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,216
Have you lost our mind?
- I will tell you why.

386
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,102
They are rich people.
- Who? - Those who we're expecting.

387
00:35:35,557 --> 00:35:38,184
They carry millions
of rupees in their coats.

388
00:35:38,264 --> 00:35:42,033
The expensive cars we own,

389
00:35:42,113 --> 00:35:44,909
their security guards own such cars.

390
00:35:45,427 --> 00:35:47,567
They use Ferrari.

391
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:48,789
Manik,

392
00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:51,082
Rani is very lucky.
- You're right.

393
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,309
Amazing.

394
00:35:56,995 --> 00:36:00,249
Manik, is this the sound of Ferrari?

395
00:36:01,871 --> 00:36:02,747
Maybe a new model.

396
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,028
This vehicle is a junk.

397
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:10,963
What's the hurry?

398
00:36:11,406 --> 00:36:15,520
What's this? Do we have to setup
a traditional dais for the ceremony?

399
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,292
They are not from the decoration team.
- Then?

400
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:20,206
The groom's family.

401
00:36:20,605 --> 00:36:22,184
The groom's family?

402
00:36:29,391 --> 00:36:30,790
Be careful.

403
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,152
You said they will arrive in Ferrari,

404
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,206
but they have arrived in carriage.

405
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:40,930
Well, they have come in a carriage

406
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,927
as they don't want people
to know they are rich. Yes.

407
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:45,817
Hey, where are you going?
- I want to pee,

408
00:36:45,897 --> 00:36:47,871
I am finding a place.

409
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:49,806
Don't go looking for a place,

410
00:36:49,886 --> 00:36:51,925
pee in the pot.
- No!

411
00:36:52,005 --> 00:36:54,682
If you don't pee in the pot,
you will pee in your pant.

412
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:56,238
What if someone asked?

413
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:00,499
Is it filter water to ask for it?
- I mean, what if someone swears me?

414
00:37:00,736 --> 00:37:03,828
Hey,
tell them you're the groom's relative.

415
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:05,219
You're right.
- Go.

416
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:07,017
I will pee in the pot.
- Hey!

417
00:37:09,514 --> 00:37:11,114
You idiot!

418
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:13,849
Have you lost your mind?
- Actually...

419
00:37:14,022 --> 00:37:15,583
You fool.

420
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:19,838
"The music..."

421
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:23,299
Brother-in-law!
Sister! Let's take a selfie!

422
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:28,044
Ready? Come.
- I will join you, too. - Pose.

423
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:29,612
Take one more picture.

424
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,747
Stop posing. Hold it.

425
00:37:33,742 --> 00:37:35,807
Apple is worth Rs. 150 a kilo.
- Take more pictures.

426
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,294
Mom, it's fallen in the water,
why are you picking it?

427
00:37:38,374 --> 00:37:40,366
They won't have to wash it again.

428
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:44,153
My God! Give it to me.
- Let's go.

429
00:37:44,574 --> 00:37:47,828
Hurry up,
I am famished, let's eat something.

430
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:50,417
They are rich people,
even the breakfast would be rich.

431
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:55,815
The bat has bitten it.

432
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:59,358
Not bat, brother-in-law bit it.

433
00:38:00,907 --> 00:38:03,815
We're very happy as you gave
your approval for the alliance.

434
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:07,426
My name is Sumadevi,
I run a finance business,

435
00:38:07,506 --> 00:38:09,590
he's my only son Gani.

436
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:14,771
He's my younger brother
Pratap and he's my husband Sundar.

437
00:38:17,144 --> 00:38:19,565
They are my younger sisters,
she is my mother.

438
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,964
Mom, greet him.
- Greetings.

439
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,771
My name is Seenappa, I am a DC.
- DC?

440
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:27,348
Dog catcher.

441
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:31,262
He's a dog catcher.
He is famously known as Nayi Sinappa.

442
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:34,527
Some call him 'Dog, my son'.

443
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,592
When I entered your gate,
I heard a dog bark.

444
00:38:38,798 --> 00:38:42,052
If you permit me, I will bring the van
and take it away tomorrow itself.

445
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,577
It is our pet.

446
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:50,809
No problem. I will take it away
if you pay me Rs. 100 extra.

447
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:53,221
Do it for free.

448
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:55,588
What's your profession?

449
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:58,647
What do you do?
- I am a stunt man in films.

450
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:02,139
Ravi Verma, Thriller Manju,
Different Danny, Mass Mada,

451
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:03,706
they are my students.

452
00:39:03,786 --> 00:39:06,441
He's famously known as Palti Sundar.

453
00:39:07,576 --> 00:39:09,919
Shall I do a somersault?

454
00:39:10,463 --> 00:39:13,587
Sit quietly, you got your
back treated just last week.

455
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,593
Mr. Ganesh, let's get to the point.

456
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,273
What's your qualification?

457
00:39:18,353 --> 00:39:22,553
Actually, I successfully
completed pre-university

458
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:24,711
two years in Bangalore university.

459
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,500
You can say PUC.

460
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,106
I said it to make it
sound more sophisticated.

461
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:33,642
You didn't study further?

462
00:39:33,722 --> 00:39:35,188
I was very much interested, sir.

463
00:39:35,268 --> 00:39:38,063
I wanted to become like Visvesvaraya,
so I removed the fuse

464
00:39:38,344 --> 00:39:41,086
and studied sitting
under the streetlight.

465
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:44,427
Did you score good marks in the exams?
- No, sir.

466
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:49,080
I developed several marks on my body
after being bitten by mosquitoes.

467
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,281
He's so funny.

468
00:39:53,264 --> 00:39:54,951
What's so funny about it?

469
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:58,896
I was the owner of automobile
company in your son's age.

470
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,734
Even he owns an auto rickshaw

471
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:01,880
and a mobile phone.

472
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,437
Even he's the owner of automobile,

473
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:05,621
but I drive the auto rickshaw.

474
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:15,275
Wow!

475
00:40:16,842 --> 00:40:18,064
She's so beautiful.

476
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:22,712
That's alright.

477
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,275
Gani, she's very beautiful.

478
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,617
Get married and come to our house soon,

479
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:31,664
I will look after you like my child.

480
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:36,054
I am really lucky.
I have not seen my mother,

481
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:39,838
I consider you one.
- Sumadevi, time is passing by,

482
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:42,912
perform the rituals fast.
- Okay.

483
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:44,907
Come.
- Hold this.

484
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,074
Hello.

485
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:51,004
Ask him to clear
the garbage immediately,

486
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:52,345
it's an order.

487
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:57,603
Father-in-law.
- Why did leave getting upset?

488
00:40:57,683 --> 00:40:58,660
I have no idea.

489
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:02,420
Sorry, Gani.

490
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,312
I never thought dad would insult you.

491
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:09,014
It's okay.

492
00:41:46,991 --> 00:41:47,987
Mr. Rathanlal,

493
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:51,176
you've come from America
because I asked you to.

494
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:52,464
I don't know how to thank you.

495
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:55,619
Mr. Chandulal, how can
we reject the marriage proposal?

496
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,095
Mr. Rathanlal, which is your native?

497
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:02,628
Our native is Arasinakunte.
- Arasinakunte?

498
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:04,041
Yes.
- Even I hail from Arasinakunte.

499
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:06,327
What's your father's name?
- Gobi Manchuri.

500
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:07,315
Gobi Manchuri?

501
00:42:07,804 --> 00:42:09,966
My father's name is Gopi
and my mother's name is Manjali.

502
00:42:10,046 --> 00:42:12,215
I am Gopi Manjali's son.

503
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:17,004
What a stupid fellow.
- I fooled you.

504
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:18,658
Did you like the girl?

505
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,582
That's fantastic!

506
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:26,268
What do you have to say?

507
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:27,868
Excuse me.

508
00:42:32,192 --> 00:42:36,733
She accepts the proposal,
but she's a little shy.

509
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:17,990
Hello, Gani.

510
00:44:18,278 --> 00:44:20,537
'Yes, Rani.'
- My father has fixed

511
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,148
my engagement in Hotel Royal.

512
00:44:22,228 --> 00:44:23,499
What do I do?

513
00:44:23,835 --> 00:44:25,878
Please do something, Gani.

514
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,737
You're worrying unnecessarily.

515
00:44:29,282 --> 00:44:32,104
Thousands of people
visit Taj Mahal daily,

516
00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:35,827
but they can't own it, right?

517
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,964
Hey!

518
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:45,001
'I am not as brave as you.'

519
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:46,719
'The boy's name is Dheeraj.'

520
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:48,564
Just a minute.

521
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,941
Who is Dheeraj?
- I am Dheeraj. - Go on.

522
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,563
My father has agreed to get me
married to him. - Okay.

523
00:44:55,643 --> 00:44:57,537
'Please, Gani, I want you.'

524
00:44:57,617 --> 00:44:59,227
I won't live without you.

525
00:44:59,307 --> 00:45:02,763
I won't ditch you, don't worry.

526
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:06,881
If you say yes, I will get
you married before these people.

527
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:08,190
What do you say?

528
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,881
My father will surely get me
married to that useless guy.

529
00:45:11,573 --> 00:45:14,243
Forget him. Let's elope today itself.

530
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,592
Elope? Why?

531
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,208
Come to the place where your father is,

532
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:21,403
your father Mr. Chandulal Bawarchi

533
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:23,770
will get us married conventionally.

534
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,220
Gani...
- Don't worry.

535
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,946
Come to the place where your father is.

536
00:45:35,082 --> 00:45:37,557
You're so beautiful.

537
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:42,325
Look, I stalled the engagement.

538
00:45:42,747 --> 00:45:46,045
So, won't you kiss me now?

539
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:49,570
Okay. Are you feeling shy?

540
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:53,300
Don't worry, I will ask everyone
to close their eyes. Come on, kiss me.

541
00:45:53,538 --> 00:45:56,284
Hello, mister.
Have you lost your mind?

542
00:45:56,511 --> 00:46:02,392
Kannada should be the first language.
My name is Gani. I am Rani's boyfriend.

543
00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:06,111
Gani!
- Please don't scream, stay calm.

544
00:46:06,191 --> 00:46:08,058
I will make everything alright.

545
00:46:08,501 --> 00:46:10,609
Let's talk. Take it.

546
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:11,582
Get off.

547
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,155
Thank you.
- You idiot!

548
00:46:20,284 --> 00:46:21,365
Shall we sit there and talk?

549
00:46:22,966 --> 00:46:26,166
Don't you have manners?
Can't you see the reserved board there?

550
00:46:26,577 --> 00:46:27,640
You're right.

551
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,144
You don't want to share sweets, you don't
want to share someone's seat,

552
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:35,668
but you want someone else's girlfriend.

553
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:37,809
What kind of manners is that?

554
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,663
Hey, what the hell is going on?

555
00:46:41,106 --> 00:46:44,717
Your daughter is in love with a ruffian

556
00:46:44,797 --> 00:46:47,787
and you want to get
her married to my son?

557
00:46:48,112 --> 00:46:49,463
You should be ashamed of yourself.

558
00:46:49,831 --> 00:46:52,285
Stop it!

559
00:46:52,365 --> 00:46:54,804
Kannada should be the first language.

560
00:46:55,253 --> 00:46:56,772
How dare you yell at him!

561
00:46:56,852 --> 00:47:01,226
I have great respect
for my father-in-law to be

562
00:47:01,306 --> 00:47:02,880
and you are yelling at him?

563
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,902
How dare you?

564
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:08,382
Hey, you met them,

565
00:47:08,587 --> 00:47:11,538
you saw the girl, you ate snacks,

566
00:47:11,618 --> 00:47:14,090
now, go home and sleep.

567
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:16,684
Junior, let me tell you something.

568
00:47:16,844 --> 00:47:18,457
Hey, take your hand off.

569
00:47:19,052 --> 00:47:21,538
Do you have the status to talk to my
son placing your hand on his shoulder?

570
00:47:21,618 --> 00:47:23,549
There's not much difference.

571
00:47:23,629 --> 00:47:27,117
He studied in boarding school
and I studied in a government school,

572
00:47:27,197 --> 00:47:30,060
he eats junk food
and I eat organic food,

573
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,931
he speaks English and I speak Kannada.

574
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,658
You idiot!
- Enough!

575
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,557
You studied in a local
Kannada medium school

576
00:47:40,637 --> 00:47:41,603
and you're showing so much arrogance.

577
00:47:41,683 --> 00:47:43,192
Hey!
- Listen,

578
00:47:43,272 --> 00:47:46,166
if you want to achieve something,
learn English.

579
00:47:46,726 --> 00:47:49,116
Those who studied in Kannada medium
school have no become successful.

580
00:47:49,196 --> 00:47:54,273
Junior, people who studied in English
medium school only construct buildings,

581
00:47:54,353 --> 00:47:58,900
the one who studied in Kannada
medium school has Kannambadi.

582
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,775
I will tell you something, remember it.

583
00:48:02,056 --> 00:48:04,971
The power of the sun may reduce,

584
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:08,845
but the one who studied in Kannada medium
school will always live with attitude.

585
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:12,002
We will live with our heads held high.

586
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:13,645
Look, mister...

587
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:14,651
Sunny,

588
00:48:16,045 --> 00:48:18,769
I don't want to waste anymore time here.
- Mr. Rathan. - Let's go.

589
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:21,450
Mr. Rathan, please.
- No more talks.

590
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:23,722
Get going. Go.

591
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,829
Mr. Rathan!
- Yes.

592
00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:31,170
Father-in-law.
- It's all because of you.

593
00:48:33,116 --> 00:48:36,684
Don't beat the wife before her husband.
- Whose wife?

594
00:48:39,368 --> 00:48:42,211
Look, do you have the capacity
to take care of my daughter?

595
00:48:42,903 --> 00:48:44,747
Forget the clothes
and ornaments she wears,

596
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:47,346
do you have the capacity
to even give her

597
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:50,210
two square meal with
the petty money you earn?

598
00:48:50,946 --> 00:48:54,675
Why are you talking like
the heroines' fathers in the movies?

599
00:48:54,755 --> 00:48:55,854
It's a very common dialogue.

600
00:48:56,903 --> 00:48:59,033
Why do you gauge a boy
based on his earnings?

601
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,952
Mostly importantly,

602
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,442
value the heart.
There are several emotions in it.

603
00:49:07,522 --> 00:49:08,590
Value them.

604
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:13,206
If you get your daughter married to me

605
00:49:13,728 --> 00:49:16,221
rather than getting her married to a
stranger I will treat her like a queen.

606
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:19,220
You can't manipulate me
like you manipulated my daughter.

607
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,252
There was once income raid in my house,

608
00:49:24,474 --> 00:49:25,879
I lost billions of rupees,

609
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:27,599
I didn't care.

610
00:49:27,992 --> 00:49:30,864
Because I was confident
I will earn money again.

611
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:35,804
But I didn't lose money this time,
but my reputation.

612
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,707
How will I regain it?
I feel scared when I think about it.

613
00:49:40,052 --> 00:49:41,458
You've done a mistake.

614
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:44,702
You have tarnished my image,

615
00:49:45,177 --> 00:49:46,961
you will definitely repent for this.

616
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,469
Why do you stress unnecessarily?

617
00:49:49,549 --> 00:49:51,977
Don't waste your time calling someone.

618
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:57,490
We can never change our destiny.

619
00:49:57,989 --> 00:49:59,630
Try to understand.

620
00:50:01,038 --> 00:50:02,032
Bye.

621
00:50:02,983 --> 00:50:04,356
Bye, Rani.

622
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:34,600
Sir,

623
00:50:36,697 --> 00:50:38,448
why are you seeing over there?

624
00:50:38,528 --> 00:50:41,313
See here.

625
00:50:41,393 --> 00:50:42,201
What's all this?

626
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:45,756
I fix different location
to every client,

627
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:48,448
this is the perfect location for you.

628
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,032
Sir, what can I do for you?
- You need to teach a lesson.

629
00:51:05,325 --> 00:51:06,914
What do you mean?

630
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,438
You're middle-aged man,

631
00:51:10,518 --> 00:51:12,103
you want me to teach you?
- Hey!

632
00:51:12,492 --> 00:51:15,255
Boss himself has many things to learn.
- Correct.

633
00:51:15,335 --> 00:51:17,357
Will you shut up?

634
00:51:17,573 --> 00:51:19,476
I mean, this is the first time
you're getting such a deal.

635
00:51:20,503 --> 00:51:22,535
My little daughter,

636
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:25,324
I took best care of her.

637
00:51:26,178 --> 00:51:28,081
A boy has made her

638
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:31,584
fall in love with him by manipulating her.
- Oh.

639
00:51:33,347 --> 00:51:35,566
It's about a girl.

640
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:39,985
It will cost you lot of money.
- I will do what you say.

641
00:51:40,882 --> 00:51:42,341
Look,

642
00:51:42,421 --> 00:51:44,179
the owner of this talkies

643
00:51:44,547 --> 00:51:47,358
had given me a contract to cut off
someone's leg. - Okay.

644
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:52,115
After I cut off his leg, the owner
escaped without paying me money. - Oh.

645
00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:54,525
So, I beheaded the owner of the talkies

646
00:51:54,605 --> 00:51:58,233
and acquired the talkies.
See if he got scared.

647
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:00,935
He is terrified.

648
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:03,011
Now, what do you say?

649
00:52:04,243 --> 00:52:07,854
But I will pay you the money sincerely.

650
00:52:07,934 --> 00:52:08,946
Okay.

651
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:10,607
If I deal with the boy

652
00:52:10,687 --> 00:52:12,687
in the right manner,

653
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:16,536
your daughter will forget him. Okay?

654
00:52:16,616 --> 00:52:19,098
I tried to do the same,
but he thrashed my men in return.

655
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,850
But in vain.

656
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,390
Let's kill him.
- We can't kill him.

657
00:52:24,654 --> 00:52:27,465
If we do that,
my daughter will get me jailed herself.

658
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:30,178
He has manipulated her completely.

659
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:33,389
So plan C will work well on them.

660
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:34,719
What's plan C?

661
00:52:35,259 --> 00:52:38,221
Tell the boy you've given
your approval for their marriage.

662
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,270
Hey, are you mad?
- Hey!

663
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:44,794
Hey!
- Hey!

664
00:52:46,665 --> 00:52:49,648
Plan C means betrayal.

665
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:53,334
What do you mean?
- We must remove the thorn with a thorn.

666
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:56,178
What if even that thorn pricks you?

667
00:52:56,258 --> 00:52:57,821
You will die.

668
00:52:58,578 --> 00:53:00,600
Why do you interfere in between us?

669
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,010
Just be quiet.
- Okay, boss.

670
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:06,967
Look, meet his family and give
them your approval for the marriage.

671
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:08,349
What difference will it make?

672
00:53:08,429 --> 00:53:09,766
Thank you so much.

673
00:53:09,972 --> 00:53:13,420
You've given your approval for
the marriage by coming here in person.

674
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:15,134
Thank you, Goddess.

675
00:53:15,214 --> 00:53:18,123
His family will believe you

676
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:19,950
saying you're such a good man.

677
00:53:20,144 --> 00:53:23,885
Look, children fall in love and
elders like you should get them married.

678
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:28,060
Now that both the families have given
their approval, let's get them married.

679
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,977
Sir, tell them that both the families
should come together in a place

680
00:53:33,258 --> 00:53:38,037
and get the couple married
in a traditional manner.

681
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,729
Lovers usually elope
and get married secretly,

682
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:48,296
but there's something in this
love cum arranged marriage.

683
00:53:48,512 --> 00:53:53,453
What if that smart boy
asks you such a question?

684
00:53:53,533 --> 00:53:55,237
You have a point.

685
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:56,556
You will...

686
00:53:56,636 --> 00:53:59,745
Even I wish to organize
the wedding at a five star hotel.

687
00:53:59,825 --> 00:54:02,447
You know my friends, my close associates

688
00:54:02,527 --> 00:54:05,161
and my relatives will raise questions.

689
00:54:06,307 --> 00:54:08,404
How will I face them?
- Oh.

690
00:54:09,907 --> 00:54:12,368
I can somehow manage that.

691
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:15,820
What if they create
ruckus at the wedding?

692
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:18,765
My daughter's life will be ruined.

693
00:54:19,144 --> 00:54:21,750
I had raised her like a princess.

694
00:54:22,437 --> 00:54:24,015
I want her to be happy.

695
00:54:26,274 --> 00:54:29,647
Sir, don't get upset,
don't get emotional.

696
00:54:30,244 --> 00:54:31,980
Your wish will come true.

697
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,217
Please don't stress.

698
00:54:35,531 --> 00:54:40,094
Thank you. - Let us know where you want
the wedding to take place.

699
00:54:40,174 --> 00:54:42,287
Find out if the bungalow
in Kollegal is vacant.

700
00:54:43,088 --> 00:54:45,390
Shooting for the film 'Aptamitra 3'
is underway in that bungalow.

701
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:47,959
'Aptamitra 3'?

702
00:54:48,374 --> 00:54:51,152
The hero of the film is Vishnuwardhan.

703
00:54:52,028 --> 00:54:54,460
No. Any other bungalow?

704
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,390
The bungalow in Thirthahalli.

705
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:56,726
Kutappa!
- Yes, boss.

706
00:54:56,806 --> 00:54:59,001
Find out if the bungalow
in Thirthahalli is vacant.

707
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,655
The bungalow is too scary.
- I will slap you!

708
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:04,266
Shooting for television show
is underway in that bungalow.

709
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:05,879
What?

710
00:55:06,414 --> 00:55:08,136
Darn it.

711
00:55:08,503 --> 00:55:11,866
Shooting for horror film and television
show is underway in both the bungalows.

712
00:55:12,503 --> 00:55:15,086
There is no place
for us to commit murder.

713
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:17,616
Is it easy to commit murder?

714
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:22,173
The state government should
felicitate us for our work.

715
00:55:23,832 --> 00:55:26,599
Why are you laughing
when we're talking seriously?

716
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:30,784
By the way, how does he look?
- Just a minute.

717
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:38,415
He looks like actor Ganesh,
the hero of the film 'Mungaru Male'.

718
00:55:39,021 --> 00:55:43,346
How can I kill such a handsome guy?
- Boss,

719
00:55:43,832 --> 00:55:45,389
you have said it yourself,

720
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:47,660
'Work is worship'.

721
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:52,741
If we don't kill him,
we won't be able to make money.

722
00:55:54,849 --> 00:55:56,730
Which bungalow is vacant?

723
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,565
Don't stress, boss.

724
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,893
To kill the one who looks
like actor Ganesh easily,

725
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:05,098
we have found a luxurious palace.

726
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:08,211
Which palace?
- Aadi Kaleshwar Mountain.

727
00:56:10,017 --> 00:56:11,866
Aadi Kaleshwar Mountain.

728
00:56:12,439 --> 00:56:13,801
Sir,

729
00:56:14,655 --> 00:56:20,839
it's a perfect place to kill Gani, the
one who's romancing with your daughter.

730
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:26,774
God, make sure we
don't face any problem.

731
00:57:27,032 --> 00:57:29,454
Protect all of us.

732
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,838
Dear.

733
00:57:32,168 --> 00:57:33,217
Take this.

734
00:57:34,082 --> 00:57:35,239
Gani.

735
00:57:38,258 --> 00:57:39,728
Protect us.

736
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,533
Hey, step aside.

737
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:49,644
Let's go!

738
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,367
It's very cold out here.

739
00:58:27,643 --> 00:58:29,081
Please be quiet.

740
00:58:31,113 --> 00:58:32,519
Uncle, take a right.

741
00:58:32,713 --> 00:58:34,854
How far is the place?

742
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,087
How far is the place?

743
00:58:50,249 --> 00:58:51,749
Let's go.

744
00:59:02,443 --> 00:59:05,213
The name of the hotel is 'Cemetery Hotel'.
I won't come here.

745
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:07,362
Uncle, one letter in it has got erased.

746
00:59:07,442 --> 00:59:09,837
It is a guesthouse. Come on.
- Is it?

747
00:59:10,399 --> 00:59:13,459
There's no customer here.
- What did you think? - Come quietly.

748
00:59:14,226 --> 00:59:18,259
I wonder what he
will serve us in dinner.

749
00:59:19,047 --> 00:59:20,593
Hello, is anyone here?
- Hello?

750
00:59:20,753 --> 00:59:24,362
I am here.
- Come out. I am famished.

751
00:59:24,442 --> 00:59:26,420
I am the owner of the hotel.
My name is Lambu Kumar.

752
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,204
Where are you? I can't see anyone.

753
00:59:28,284 --> 00:59:29,945
I am standing before you.

754
00:59:32,734 --> 00:59:34,996
Are you owner or horror?

755
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:40,528
Hey, come on.

756
00:59:40,608 --> 00:59:42,236
What is happening?

757
00:59:43,966 --> 00:59:45,123
Hi.
- Hey!

758
00:59:45,879 --> 00:59:47,782
Instead of being in a hotel,
what are you doing in the drum?

759
00:59:47,862 --> 00:59:52,252
When customer would eat here,
flies would sit on the food.

760
00:59:52,332 --> 00:59:54,473
That is the reason
I am spraying a repellent.

761
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:58,187
If you do that, the flies won't die,
but people will die. Come out!

762
00:59:58,267 --> 00:59:59,460
Okay.

763
01:00:08,949 --> 01:00:10,949
You got scared seeing him.

764
01:00:11,209 --> 01:00:12,156
I got scared.

765
01:00:12,236 --> 01:00:15,788
Sir, your name is Lambu,
but you're short in stature.

766
01:00:15,868 --> 01:00:18,927
If you name yourself Ganesha,
will you befriend a mouse?

767
01:00:19,175 --> 01:00:22,289
Aren't their people named Ganesha
who befriend men. - He is right?

768
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,897
It's not necessary to be as per name.

769
01:00:24,977 --> 01:00:26,494
You go sit there.

770
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,559
Darling, the customer is here.
Go and attend them.

771
01:00:33,954 --> 01:00:36,505
Hello. You go sit there.

772
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:39,770
Okay.
- Oh.

773
01:00:40,202 --> 01:00:41,456
He is peeping inside.

774
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,148
Come soon.

775
01:00:53,792 --> 01:00:54,765
Take this.

776
01:00:59,912 --> 01:01:00,787
Give me water.

777
01:01:03,089 --> 01:01:05,197
Uncle, he's asking for water.

778
01:01:06,484 --> 01:01:09,208
Hey, what do you have for dinner?

779
01:01:09,288 --> 01:01:11,023
Sir, do you want sea food or mutton?

780
01:01:11,103 --> 01:01:13,813
What do you mean?
- I mean, do you want fish

781
01:01:13,893 --> 01:01:16,126
or goat meat.
- Oh.

782
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:18,526
Do you have mutton chops?

783
01:01:18,606 --> 01:01:20,202
No.

784
01:01:20,926 --> 01:01:22,069
I have curd rice.

785
01:01:22,937 --> 01:01:26,332
What is he saying?
- Hey! Do you at least have minced meat?

786
01:01:26,412 --> 01:01:27,845
No, sir.

787
01:01:28,072 --> 01:01:29,013
I have rotis.

788
01:01:29,093 --> 01:01:32,418
What kind of a hotel is this?
You don't have anything.

789
01:01:32,498 --> 01:01:35,261
You were asking us if
we wanted sea food or mutton?

790
01:01:35,341 --> 01:01:37,498
Sir, it is a gimmick.

791
01:01:37,578 --> 01:01:40,677
If I don't give a gimmick,

792
01:01:40,926 --> 01:01:43,217
one can't do business.

793
01:01:43,297 --> 01:01:44,915
You idiot!

794
01:01:45,228 --> 01:01:47,293
Your business will prosper
if you serve non-vegetarian dishes.

795
01:01:47,373 --> 01:01:50,612
People travelling on the highway will come
and eat here, your business will flourish.

796
01:01:50,692 --> 01:01:51,213
Am I right?

797
01:01:51,293 --> 01:01:53,759
Sir, people travelling on highway
don't come here,

798
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:57,402
people who have died
in an accident come here.

799
01:01:57,482 --> 01:02:01,889
What do you mean?
- Sir, I mean ghosts.

800
01:02:03,478 --> 01:02:05,900
Wandering spirits haunt this place

801
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:10,728
in disguise of travelers.

802
01:02:10,808 --> 01:02:15,067
You're short in stature,

803
01:02:15,147 --> 01:02:18,224
somebody may eat you up thinking
you're a biscuit. Be careful.

804
01:02:18,495 --> 01:02:20,830
Gani, don't joke in this matter.

805
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:24,485
Do you get booze here?
- You won't find it here,

806
01:02:24,565 --> 01:02:28,421
you'll get in the bar at a village
after you cross the highway.

807
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:32,459
Oh, thank God. I will find it.
- Dad,

808
01:02:32,539 --> 01:02:35,847
if you get drunk and fall somewhere,
where will I find you?

809
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:37,598
Why should you find me?

810
01:02:37,814 --> 01:02:40,019
I will jump from here and reach the bar,

811
01:02:40,192 --> 01:02:44,150
I will drink alcohol and
jump back to this location.

812
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:47,360
Will you come along?
- I quit drinking two months ago.

813
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,993
Go.
- I am leaving.

814
01:02:49,073 --> 01:02:51,111
Shall I serve you hot dosa?

815
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:52,668
Okay, get me something to eat.

816
01:02:52,748 --> 01:02:56,454
I am famished.
- Darling, serve chutney to them.

817
01:03:01,306 --> 01:03:03,651
Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

818
01:03:03,731 --> 01:03:04,906
To pee.

819
01:03:13,155 --> 01:03:14,722
What do you want?

820
01:03:14,802 --> 01:03:16,355
I want you.

821
01:03:17,933 --> 01:03:20,679
I want a mug to wash my hands.

822
01:03:21,696 --> 01:03:24,535
Not just mug,

823
01:03:24,615 --> 01:03:26,896
I can give you a child.

824
01:03:32,085 --> 01:03:33,058
No.

825
01:03:34,506 --> 01:03:37,696
Where do I go looking
for the bar in the forest?

826
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:43,296
Had God created animals who would
give liquor, like the cows give milk,

827
01:03:43,524 --> 01:03:46,075
drunkards like me
would keep them with us

828
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:48,691
and go around everywhere.

829
01:03:54,237 --> 01:03:55,508
Bottle?

830
01:03:56,352 --> 01:03:58,431
Miracle in the midnight.

831
01:04:00,345 --> 01:04:03,276
Whiskey.

832
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:07,978
What is this? There's snack too.

833
01:04:10,053 --> 01:04:12,028
They've even kept pickle with booze.

834
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:15,697
This is a graveyard.

835
01:04:17,588 --> 01:04:18,886
I don't want it.

836
01:04:19,762 --> 01:04:23,189
I think someone has offered
liquor to the dead body.

837
01:04:24,076 --> 01:04:25,157
I don't want it.

838
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:36,258
I think the deceased is my friend.

839
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:37,897
Let it be.

840
01:04:38,496 --> 01:04:42,297
Cheers, my dear oil friend.
This is for you.

841
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,763
Gani, why are they
taking so long to make dosa?

842
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:53,190
Just check where your dad and Pratap is.
- Where did they go?

843
01:05:01,461 --> 01:05:03,483
He's left his phone here.

844
01:05:04,206 --> 01:05:06,227
Mom, I will go and check.

845
01:05:06,307 --> 01:05:09,395
Gani, come soon.
You're leaving me alone here.

846
01:05:09,475 --> 01:05:11,070
I will be back soon.

847
01:05:11,383 --> 01:05:12,865
Come soon.
- Okay.

848
01:05:13,211 --> 01:05:18,302
"Take me with you."

849
01:05:18,768 --> 01:05:21,174
"Come to me."

850
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,786
Hi.

851
01:05:38,218 --> 01:05:40,726
I had heard that women are fast,

852
01:05:40,806 --> 01:05:43,018
but you're very fast.

853
01:05:43,098 --> 01:05:45,223
I didn't know you'd be here so soon.

854
01:05:45,303 --> 01:05:47,450
It is for you.

855
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:49,247
For me?

856
01:05:51,136 --> 01:05:52,585
What is your name?

857
01:05:52,953 --> 01:05:55,013
'Garbhini' (Pregnant).
- Garbhini?

858
01:05:55,093 --> 01:05:57,082
Is that a name?
- Yes.

859
01:05:57,266 --> 01:05:59,353
We are four sisters.

860
01:05:59,537 --> 01:06:01,959
One is Dharini, the other is Harini,

861
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:03,841
the third one is Bharini,

862
01:06:03,921 --> 01:06:07,739
and my parents didn't find any rhyming
name, so, they named me as Garbhini.

863
01:06:07,819 --> 01:06:10,900
Oh, I can't fall in love with you.
- Why?

864
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,068
What else can I do?

865
01:06:12,148 --> 01:06:15,610
Can I say anyone that I am in love
with a pregnant woman?

866
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:19,517
People will thrash me.
- So, you don't love me?

867
01:06:19,597 --> 01:06:20,858
No.

868
01:06:21,571 --> 01:06:24,649
I love you.
- Me too.

869
01:06:25,063 --> 01:06:28,198
Don't say 'Me too'. I am scared of it.

870
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:31,474
Will you swing me?

871
01:06:31,777 --> 01:06:33,755
Should I?
- Yes.

872
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:49,420
What are you looking
for at such late hour?

873
01:06:50,663 --> 01:06:53,723
Ghosts wander here at 12 midnight.

874
01:06:53,803 --> 01:06:55,366
It is at 12 midnight.

875
01:06:55,982 --> 01:06:58,046
It's 11:45 p.m. now.
I have 15 minutes more.

876
01:06:58,241 --> 01:07:00,209
If I meet ghosts,
I will say hello to them.

877
01:07:00,289 --> 01:07:03,528
Don't joke.
This is not West of chord road.

878
01:07:04,468 --> 01:07:06,598
This is a dangerous forest.

879
01:07:06,933 --> 01:07:11,149
Restless souls of girls
wander in this place.

880
01:07:11,712 --> 01:07:16,177
If they see a handsome boy like you,
they'll possess you.

881
01:07:16,257 --> 01:07:19,182
Those are not restless souls of girls,

882
01:07:19,355 --> 01:07:23,031
but the souls of the girls
who couldn't conceive.

883
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:26,609
They can possess anyone.

884
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:28,744
You be careful.

885
01:07:29,077 --> 01:07:31,657
Hey! Stop talking rubbish. Go away!

886
01:07:32,273 --> 01:07:36,489
Where's the bar?
- Who told you there's a bar here?

887
01:07:36,569 --> 01:07:39,001
The short guy in the hotel.
- Hotel?

888
01:07:39,081 --> 01:07:40,725
Yes, hotel.
- Hotel?

889
01:07:40,805 --> 01:07:43,030
Why are you surprised?

890
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:47,535
Did I get surprised?
- Look at your face. Go away.

891
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:54,663
They didn't serve me dosa till now.

892
01:07:54,933 --> 01:07:56,133
Lambu!

893
01:07:57,193 --> 01:07:58,663
Lambu!

894
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:02,771
There's no one here.

895
01:08:03,366 --> 01:08:04,512
Lambu!

896
01:08:05,972 --> 01:08:07,604
Lambu!

897
01:08:10,642 --> 01:08:12,043
Lambu!

898
01:08:26,783 --> 01:08:28,231
Lambu!

899
01:08:30,123 --> 01:08:34,004
Oh. I am feeling so relaxed.

900
01:08:35,495 --> 01:08:38,846
What is your name?

901
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:42,792
Whiskey? Oh.

902
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:46,025
He has named himself as Whiskey.

903
01:08:59,287 --> 01:09:01,156
I drank raw.

904
01:09:01,892 --> 01:09:05,611
If I had soda, it would've been nice.

905
01:09:17,068 --> 01:09:18,528
Oh no!

906
01:09:22,063 --> 01:09:23,880
Should I push you harder?

907
01:09:25,868 --> 01:09:27,393
Should I?

908
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:34,297
She disappeared with the swing?

909
01:09:34,377 --> 01:09:35,307
Where did she go?

910
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,107
Garbhini? Oh no!

911
01:09:45,976 --> 01:09:49,058
I am sure she was not a woman,
but a witch.

912
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:57,305
Lambu?

913
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:09,197
Ghost! Gani!

914
01:10:09,424 --> 01:10:16,127
Ghost! Gani, where are you?

915
01:10:16,321 --> 01:10:18,040
Gani!

916
01:10:22,257 --> 01:10:23,490
Mom?

917
01:10:25,144 --> 01:10:26,625
Mom?

918
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:30,290
Mom?

919
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,479
What is it?

920
01:10:34,559 --> 01:10:35,862
Is this the hotel you were talking about?

921
01:10:35,942 --> 01:10:38,008
There was a hotel here, I had left
my mom. I don't see her here now.

922
01:10:38,088 --> 01:10:38,910
Your mom?
- Yes.

923
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:40,130
Mom?
- Yes.

924
01:10:43,932 --> 01:10:44,895
Mom!

925
01:11:06,327 --> 01:11:07,333
Mom!

926
01:11:08,997 --> 01:11:09,938
Mom!

927
01:11:28,706 --> 01:11:31,420
Gani, stop!

928
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,631
I saw a ghost. Come here.

929
01:11:35,322 --> 01:11:36,739
Oh God.

930
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:39,236
There's a ghost there.
- Uncle, what happened?

931
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:40,900
I swear, I saw a ghost.
- What are you saying?

932
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,855
Gani!

933
01:11:43,884 --> 01:11:45,604
Gani.
- Mom?

934
01:11:45,684 --> 01:11:47,549
Gani, that was a haunted hotel.

935
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:49,766
There was no hotel.
- Your father is missing.

936
01:11:49,846 --> 01:11:51,820
Where is father?
- I don't know.

937
01:11:52,155 --> 01:11:54,302
Gani!
- Brother-in-law!

938
01:11:54,382 --> 01:11:57,633
Dear.
- Brother-in-law is here.

939
01:11:58,274 --> 01:12:00,630
Oh.
- Dad.

940
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:02,662
Dad? Are you alright?

941
01:12:02,742 --> 01:12:05,516
Dear, what happened to you?
How far is that bungalow?

942
01:12:05,596 --> 01:12:08,111
Aadi Kaleshwar mountain is...

943
01:12:13,765 --> 01:12:14,987
Look there.

944
01:13:41,371 --> 01:13:42,458
Brother-in-law.

945
01:13:43,507 --> 01:13:44,503
Brother-in-law.

946
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:45,788
Brother-in-law.

947
01:13:46,015 --> 01:13:48,675
Brother-in-law, wake up.

948
01:13:49,961 --> 01:13:53,367
Why? - Brother-in-law,
I can hear some sound from behind.

949
01:13:53,447 --> 01:13:55,773
If you eat more potatoes,

950
01:13:56,209 --> 01:13:58,339
you get sound from behind.

951
01:13:58,419 --> 01:14:00,890
Brother-in-law!
- Go.

952
01:14:01,387 --> 01:14:03,009
Go to sleep.

953
01:14:03,089 --> 01:14:05,117
Don't disturb me. Go!

954
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:07,085
He is waking me up.

955
01:14:39,953 --> 01:14:42,081
Pratap, why are you shouting?

956
01:14:42,161 --> 01:14:44,206
What happened to you?
- Sister, there's a ghost.

957
01:14:44,286 --> 01:14:46,319
Brother-in-law, there's a ghost here.
- Where?

958
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,043
Where is it? - I saw a white cloth.
- Where is the ghost?

959
01:14:49,123 --> 01:14:52,362
What are you saying?
You saw ghost in white clothes.

960
01:14:52,442 --> 01:14:53,842
Sir, what happened to you?

961
01:14:54,048 --> 01:14:56,978
You got scared seeing the cloth?

962
01:14:57,058 --> 01:14:59,457
The TV turned on, on its own.

963
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:01,454
There was no current, it came just now.
- Oh.

964
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:03,454
Who are you?

965
01:15:03,534 --> 01:15:06,999
Ma'am, my name is Vayyari Naga.
I am the supervisor of this house.

966
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:09,853
The bald man you see here,
his name is Bikkalige Babu.

967
01:15:09,933 --> 01:15:10,858
He's a servant.

968
01:15:10,938 --> 01:15:13,496
His name is Solle Batti Somanna.
- Greetings, sir.

969
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:15,514
He will make sure that
no mosquito bites you.

970
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,826
Her name is Serial Seethamma.

971
01:15:18,906 --> 01:15:21,406
She is a cook,
but she is crazy about serials.

972
01:15:21,486 --> 01:15:24,469
She even watches the repeat telecast.
- Women think seriously

973
01:15:24,549 --> 01:15:26,053
only about two things, one is sari,

974
01:15:26,133 --> 01:15:27,612
the other is serial.

975
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:32,025
You're absolutely right.
The serials these days are very good.

976
01:15:32,284 --> 01:15:35,992
Hey, what are you doing?
- I was checking if you're Seeta or ghost.

977
01:15:36,072 --> 01:15:39,009
Your toes are in the front.
Thank you very much. Oh, my God.

978
01:15:39,089 --> 01:15:40,415
You say you're servants.

979
01:15:40,881 --> 01:15:42,305
No one was here
when we came here last night.

980
01:15:42,385 --> 01:15:43,929
Our boss asked us to come at this time.

981
01:15:44,009 --> 01:15:45,573
Who is your boss?

982
01:16:06,371 --> 01:16:09,176
Sir?

983
01:16:12,302 --> 01:16:14,879
His spit went into my eyes.
- Who are you?

984
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:18,795
I cut into pieces and then burn it.

985
01:16:20,226 --> 01:16:21,761
What do you mean?
- I mean,

986
01:16:21,841 --> 01:16:25,746
I cut the vegetables
into pieces and cook them.

987
01:16:26,847 --> 01:16:28,414
I am the cheapest cook.

988
01:16:30,279 --> 01:16:32,307
You don't look like a cook.

989
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,975
You look like a conspiring cat.

990
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:37,964
Cooks have a bright face.

991
01:16:38,044 --> 01:16:40,804
Sir, I don't have a bright face,

992
01:16:41,147 --> 01:16:43,575
but I cook nice food. Here.

993
01:16:43,655 --> 01:16:46,758
One should add ginger to the tea,
but you're putting finger in it.

994
01:16:46,838 --> 01:16:49,872
I was just checking if the tea
has turned cold due to winter.

995
01:16:49,952 --> 01:16:52,426
Idiot, go away!

996
01:16:52,735 --> 01:16:54,739
If you don't want, I will drink it.

997
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,796
Sir is here. Hold this.

998
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:08,858
What an amazing house, dad.

999
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:12,179
Thank you. You like it?
- Yes, it is fantastic.

1000
01:17:12,259 --> 01:17:13,576
I love it.

1001
01:17:13,656 --> 01:17:15,419
You go relax.
- Okay.

1002
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:19,538
Father-in-law,
the bungalow is very nice and big.

1003
01:17:19,618 --> 01:17:21,430
Wonderful I say.

1004
01:17:22,507 --> 01:17:25,221
Go. - First let's go
and find a room for ourselves.

1005
01:17:27,374 --> 01:17:28,344
Hey, let's go.

1006
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,328
Idiot.

1007
01:17:36,935 --> 01:17:38,652
Greetings, sir.

1008
01:17:38,732 --> 01:17:41,251
Who are you?
- You're a fool.

1009
01:17:41,457 --> 01:17:43,083
Look here, I am Gundanna.

1010
01:17:43,163 --> 01:17:44,882
Gundanna?
- Yes.

1011
01:17:44,962 --> 01:17:47,756
You are in disguise.
- I told you that day,

1012
01:17:48,523 --> 01:17:51,259
I will change my get up
and set up as per the location.

1013
01:17:51,339 --> 01:17:53,286
What a location you've found.

1014
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:56,825
Even Google went crazy
finding your location.

1015
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:57,901
Sir,

1016
01:17:57,981 --> 01:18:00,993
should I murder him before Garuda mall?
- No.

1017
01:18:01,073 --> 01:18:05,184
Even God shouldn't know
how I killed him inside.

1018
01:18:09,055 --> 01:18:11,860
Go.

1019
01:18:23,814 --> 01:18:25,415
I don't find anything when I want it.

1020
01:18:32,551 --> 01:18:34,195
How did this come here?

1021
01:18:36,376 --> 01:18:40,807
Oh Goddess Banshakari, I forgot to
get You, but You came here on your own.

1022
01:18:40,887 --> 01:18:43,300
Oh Goddess.

1023
01:18:48,216 --> 01:18:50,162
Is everyone here?
- You can start.

1024
01:18:50,242 --> 01:18:53,048
Marriage is a big event in our family.

1025
01:18:53,403 --> 01:18:54,976
We call it as 'Mata Ki Chowki'.

1026
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:58,081
There will be bhajans
one day before marriage.

1027
01:18:58,395 --> 01:19:00,147
On the wedding day,
there'll be wedding in the morning,

1028
01:19:00,227 --> 01:19:03,708
and light music in the evening,
the dinner will be...

1029
01:19:03,788 --> 01:19:08,591
'Dhokla', 'Kaju Katli, 'Rabdi',
'Malpua', 'Phulka', 'Rajbhog'.

1030
01:19:08,671 --> 01:19:10,726
You'll enjoy for three days.

1031
01:19:11,918 --> 01:19:14,176
You won't have so many things
on your menu, right?

1032
01:19:14,256 --> 01:19:15,903
Take back your words!

1033
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:20,231
You don't know about
Karnataka cuisine yet.

1034
01:19:20,311 --> 01:19:21,960
Uncle! - Yes.
- Come on, say it.

1035
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:25,292
When a boy from our family gets married,

1036
01:19:25,372 --> 01:19:29,335
we make a thatch in front
of the house and start the grandeur.

1037
01:19:29,415 --> 01:19:33,745
After finishing bachelor's party,
we go to the wedding hall.

1038
01:19:33,825 --> 01:19:37,991
We put all the relatives in one room
and young boys in one room.

1039
01:19:38,071 --> 01:19:40,831
We play games all night.

1040
01:19:40,911 --> 01:19:44,850
We smoke and deliver dialogues.

1041
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:47,140
We have so much fun.

1042
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:50,586
We go to the wedding hall at the
auspicious time and ogle at girls,

1043
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:54,331
we tease old men and women.

1044
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,850
The wedding will be in the morning..
- Very good.

1045
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:59,025
Consummation at night.

1046
01:19:59,105 --> 01:20:01,590
A feast after one week.

1047
01:20:01,776 --> 01:20:04,132
Non-vegetarian feast.
- Non-vegetarian feast.

1048
01:20:04,212 --> 01:20:07,739
Millet flour balls with chicken curry,
chops, goat head curry,

1049
01:20:07,819 --> 01:20:10,396
leg fry, liver fry, mutton,

1050
01:20:10,476 --> 01:20:11,873
mutton fry, chicken fry,

1051
01:20:11,953 --> 01:20:14,449
mutton biryani, chicken biryani,

1052
01:20:14,529 --> 01:20:16,785
spleen, kidney...
- Kidney?

1053
01:20:16,865 --> 01:20:19,510
Kidney.
- Hello, do you know kidney?

1054
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:20,586
Kidney. Bones.

1055
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:24,296
We don't know anything you are saying.

1056
01:20:24,376 --> 01:20:27,513
He doesn't know what mutton bones are.

1057
01:20:27,593 --> 01:20:31,189
He doesn't know what mutton bones are.
He doesn't know. - Okay.

1058
01:20:31,269 --> 01:20:34,200
Look, one should follow their culture.

1059
01:20:35,059 --> 01:20:36,593
You're right.

1060
01:20:36,812 --> 01:20:39,193
Let's not argue about anything.

1061
01:20:39,273 --> 01:20:42,525
Suma. - Yes.
- Quickly finish the ceremony.

1062
01:20:42,788 --> 01:20:45,445
Rani, my mother-in-law
had given this sari to me.

1063
01:20:45,777 --> 01:20:47,632
I am giving this to you. Here.

1064
01:20:55,543 --> 01:20:56,779
Wow!
- Clap!

1065
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:13,841
Gudanna, will you kill him in three days?
- You don't worry about it.

1066
01:21:13,921 --> 01:21:17,081
You just think about organizing
the funeral ceremony.

1067
01:21:17,161 --> 01:21:19,130
Sure?
- It's pure.

1068
01:21:20,722 --> 01:21:22,279
Who are you staring at?

1069
01:21:23,883 --> 01:21:27,650
Oh, look what is he doing.

1070
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,283
Oh, you...

1071
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:37,164
Oh.

1072
01:21:47,206 --> 01:21:50,618
Sir, before we make him a dead body,

1073
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:54,123
your daughter is planning
to make him a dad. - Idiot.

1074
01:21:54,203 --> 01:21:55,657
Why have I called you here?

1075
01:21:56,722 --> 01:21:59,859
Scold him, father-in-law.
Hey, are you a chef?

1076
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,630
You say people who eat
your food will become Bruce Lee.

1077
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:04,302
My stomach is hurting.

1078
01:22:04,382 --> 01:22:06,776
Forget the dog,

1079
01:22:06,856 --> 01:22:09,031
even my father-in-law won't eat
the food made by you. - Hey.

1080
01:22:09,111 --> 01:22:10,372
Sir.
- Yes.

1081
01:22:11,234 --> 01:22:14,253
How about killing him
before we kill him?

1082
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:17,332
It's a nice idea. I will pay you extra.

1083
01:22:17,412 --> 01:22:21,019
Superb. I will do it right away.
- Hey. You stay quiet

1084
01:22:21,099 --> 01:22:23,698
and see what is going on there.

1085
01:22:29,789 --> 01:22:31,404
Father-in-law, stay quiet.

1086
01:22:31,484 --> 01:22:34,289
Do you know what will happen
if I stay quiet? - They will bear kids.

1087
01:22:39,991 --> 01:22:42,350
Oh, go there and break them.

1088
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:44,354
Go.
- Don't worry.

1089
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:02,033
What nonsense is this? Why didn't you
take him to the hospital for treatment?

1090
01:23:02,113 --> 01:23:06,223
Sir, he says he treats according
to the scriptures.

1091
01:23:06,303 --> 01:23:08,468
They don't go to the hospital at all.

1092
01:23:08,685 --> 01:23:10,837
He came here to do good to this village.

1093
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:12,303
He is ill now.

1094
01:23:12,525 --> 01:23:16,059
I don't know how many people
will the spirit in the bungalow kill.

1095
01:23:26,341 --> 01:23:30,234
Only two people in the world
won't get sleep at night.

1096
01:23:30,646 --> 01:23:34,424
One is, the owl
and the other is the girl in love.

1097
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:38,982
Girls always ruin
the sleep of the boys.

1098
01:23:39,177 --> 01:23:42,119
Sister.

1099
01:23:42,199 --> 01:23:44,776
Sister, it is Gani's call.
Give it to him.

1100
01:23:45,761 --> 01:23:47,078
Give it to him.

1101
01:23:48,589 --> 01:23:50,776
Listen. Listen!

1102
01:23:52,184 --> 01:23:54,154
What is it?
- Phone.

1103
01:23:54,371 --> 01:23:56,661
Whose phone?
- It is for Gani.

1104
01:23:57,429 --> 01:23:58,539
Give it to me.

1105
01:23:59,341 --> 01:24:01,562
Gani, take the phone.

1106
01:24:04,895 --> 01:24:07,391
Hello?
- Gani, what are you doing?

1107
01:24:07,998 --> 01:24:10,082
I am sleeping on the hill.

1108
01:24:10,162 --> 01:24:13,883
Oh, idiot. I am missing you so much.

1109
01:24:15,486 --> 01:24:17,628
I have not slept from past one week.

1110
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:21,028
I feel feverish too.

1111
01:24:21,486 --> 01:24:23,478
I am unable to eat.
What has happened to me?

1112
01:24:24,956 --> 01:24:26,375
Get yourself examined.

1113
01:24:27,143 --> 01:24:30,360
You may be suffering from dengue.
- You joke for everything I say.

1114
01:24:31,231 --> 01:24:34,403
Wear my favourite shirt,

1115
01:24:34,483 --> 01:24:37,747
apply perfume,
and come to the terrace.

1116
01:24:37,999 --> 01:24:39,111
I will give you whatever you want.

1117
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:41,686
Whatever you want to give,
give it to me.

1118
01:24:42,429 --> 01:24:45,876
Uncle? - He is sleeping.
I will give the phone to him later.

1119
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:48,212
No, I will give it to him.

1120
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:51,578
Okay uncle, good night.
- Okay, good night.

1121
01:27:28,655 --> 01:27:29,881
Sir.

1122
01:27:36,533 --> 01:27:38,777
Who is this beggar? Who let you inside?

1123
01:27:39,029 --> 01:27:42,899
Is someone here?
- Oh. Didn't you recognise me?

1124
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:44,914
No.
- I am your son-in-law.

1125
01:27:46,746 --> 01:27:50,639
Oh, uncle.
You have another daughter,

1126
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:53,243
you got married to a beggar,
you didn't tell this to us.

1127
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,474
Your son-in-law to be works hard,
your other son-in-law,

1128
01:27:57,554 --> 01:27:59,192
wanders around you,

1129
01:27:59,272 --> 01:28:04,345
this son-in-law begs on the streets.
What a combination. - Shut up!

1130
01:28:04,425 --> 01:28:06,770
Father-in-law, it is me, Manikchand.

1131
01:28:08,753 --> 01:28:11,593
Manik? What have you done to yourself?

1132
01:28:11,673 --> 01:28:13,528
When I went for jogging in the morning,

1133
01:28:13,608 --> 01:28:16,218
I stepped on a dog's tail unknowingly.

1134
01:28:16,298 --> 01:28:18,920
I apologized to it and moved forward,

1135
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,176
a group of dogs attacked me.

1136
01:28:21,256 --> 01:28:23,329
How did the dogs know what
you did that they came in a group?

1137
01:28:24,027 --> 01:28:26,855
Uncle, the dog would've
sent a group message. Then?

1138
01:28:26,935 --> 01:28:28,836
I bend down to do exercise...

1139
01:28:28,916 --> 01:28:30,267
You made a mistake.

1140
01:28:30,588 --> 01:28:32,626
Why did you have
to bend before the dogs?

1141
01:28:33,553 --> 01:28:35,466
You get yourself injected.
- He's right.

1142
01:28:35,546 --> 01:28:36,897
14 injections.
- What?

1143
01:28:37,858 --> 01:28:41,340
Gani! Rani... Come soon.

1144
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:43,755
Oh God.

1145
01:28:45,508 --> 01:28:46,733
Look there.

1146
01:28:52,848 --> 01:28:54,370
What happened?

1147
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:58,630
I was going towards
the room to meet Gani...

1148
01:29:06,233 --> 01:29:08,901
You were near Gani's room.

1149
01:29:09,908 --> 01:29:12,656
You were found near the well,
how is it possible?

1150
01:29:12,736 --> 01:29:16,057
Yes, I know.

1151
01:29:16,137 --> 01:29:20,556
I will tell you. While we were
coming here, so many things happened.

1152
01:29:20,636 --> 01:29:24,289
It was so terrible. The same affect

1153
01:29:24,579 --> 01:29:28,376
is happening here too. It is confirmed.

1154
01:29:28,456 --> 01:29:29,360
What happened?

1155
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:33,975
Actually, Gani has asked me
not to tell it to anyone.

1156
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:36,723
Son-in-law?
- I don't want to give you tension.

1157
01:29:37,457 --> 01:29:40,205
Why have we all gathered here?
- For the wedding.

1158
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,014
We've come here for auspicious work,

1159
01:29:42,094 --> 01:29:43,377
why talk about such things?

1160
01:29:43,457 --> 01:29:45,930
Don't take any tension.

1161
01:29:46,124 --> 01:29:48,770
Get one full bottle, 2 kilos chicken,

1162
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:50,556
and two lemons,
we'll place it near the well,

1163
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:53,154
and move from there
without looking back...

1164
01:29:53,383 --> 01:29:55,548
You will steal it, right?

1165
01:29:55,868 --> 01:29:58,937
Dad, you always think about sitting...

1166
01:29:59,521 --> 01:30:02,933
Okay, she is scared. Console her.
- Nothing will happen.

1167
01:30:03,437 --> 01:30:06,196
She will be fine if I apply vermillion
of Goddess Banshankari on her forehead.

1168
01:30:06,276 --> 01:30:08,440
You take rest. Let's go, let she rest.

1169
01:30:09,161 --> 01:30:10,673
Idiots!

1170
01:30:11,016 --> 01:30:12,665
What is going on here?

1171
01:30:14,512 --> 01:30:17,749
Sir?
- Idiot! What is going on here?

1172
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:20,199
Why did you get us to a haunted house?

1173
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:21,905
Don't worry, sir.

1174
01:30:22,421 --> 01:30:26,004
Even ghosts dance on our boss's tunes.

1175
01:30:26,244 --> 01:30:28,260
Are they item dancers?

1176
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:33,160
Sir, all the ghosts are under
my control.

1177
01:30:33,503 --> 01:30:37,637
It dances on my tunes, makes sounds,
and scares people as per my orders.

1178
01:30:39,177 --> 01:30:41,622
This is my setting.

1179
01:30:41,885 --> 01:30:44,931
Do people believe in
ghosts even in this era?

1180
01:30:56,038 --> 01:30:58,408
Ask him where the box is.
- Okay.

1181
01:30:59,336 --> 01:31:00,435
What is he asking about?

1182
01:31:00,515 --> 01:31:01,236
I can't understand.

1183
01:31:01,316 --> 01:31:04,099
He is asking about the spirit box.
- The box?

1184
01:31:04,821 --> 01:31:07,397
Sir, listen to me,
don't go to the bungalow to keep the box

1185
01:31:07,477 --> 01:31:08,600
and get into trouble.

1186
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,753
There won't be any problem
in the bungalow hereafter.

1187
01:31:34,283 --> 01:31:39,584
I fell unconscious because of
the attack by the spirit.

1188
01:31:39,664 --> 01:31:41,702
Where is the spirit?
- It is inside the box.

1189
01:31:41,782 --> 01:31:46,042
The horror effect should
start exactly at 12:00 midnight.

1190
01:31:46,419 --> 01:31:49,017
Or no one will believe us.

1191
01:31:49,569 --> 01:31:51,447
Why are you smiling?

1192
01:31:51,527 --> 01:31:53,188
I am not making a toothpaste ad.

1193
01:31:53,268 --> 01:31:55,306
You're enacting a ghost,
blacken your teeth.

1194
01:31:56,657 --> 01:31:59,073
Why are you combing your hair?

1195
01:31:59,153 --> 01:32:01,443
You're enacting a ghost,
you shouldn't comb your hair.

1196
01:32:03,015 --> 01:32:06,069
Look, she is doing perfect acting.

1197
01:32:06,372 --> 01:32:07,672
I like this devil.

1198
01:32:08,553 --> 01:32:10,030
Boys.
- Boss.

1199
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:12,069
Is the sound and light effect ready?

1200
01:32:12,149 --> 01:32:15,618
Boss, everything is ready.
- Yes, it is ready.

1201
01:32:15,985 --> 01:32:19,993
We're ready. - Your contribution
is important for my concept.

1202
01:32:20,073 --> 01:32:21,985
Boss, you don't worry.
- We're with you, boss.

1203
01:32:22,065 --> 01:32:24,539
You don't worry, we're with you.
- Thank you, boys.

1204
01:32:25,535 --> 01:32:30,355
Today, I will show him
what is the fear of death.

1205
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:35,877
Is it? What about us?

1206
01:32:36,642 --> 01:32:40,753
We're done for.
If you tell such matter suddenly,

1207
01:32:40,833 --> 01:32:43,203
how can I bear it?
- What happened?

1208
01:32:43,283 --> 01:32:47,131
You stay quiet. I am already tensed.
- Tension?

1209
01:32:47,211 --> 01:32:50,623
Everything is over. Our bad luck.
- What happened?

1210
01:32:50,703 --> 01:32:53,463
We are destined only for that.
Forget it.

1211
01:32:53,543 --> 01:32:55,449
Let it be.
- What happened?

1212
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:59,657
Listen, I am asking you. What happened?
- Mom, you sit. You don't worry.

1213
01:32:59,737 --> 01:33:01,352
Come on, play. Sit down, mom.
- Gani,

1214
01:33:01,432 --> 01:33:04,065
he said, 'We're destined only for that'.

1215
01:33:04,145 --> 01:33:06,034
Mom, all the bars will be closed today.

1216
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,358
So, dad is feeling restless.
- Then?

1217
01:33:08,438 --> 01:33:11,461
You play.
- He said, 'We're done for'.

1218
01:33:11,541 --> 01:33:13,316
Mom, he would've
asked for a full bottle,

1219
01:33:13,396 --> 01:33:17,656
but he would've only got a quarter bottle.
So, he is sad about it. You play.

1220
01:33:17,736 --> 01:33:20,621
Your husband is too much. Mom, play.
- Is it so?

1221
01:33:34,922 --> 01:33:36,216
What is it?

1222
01:33:39,078 --> 01:33:41,025
Why is your father acting strange?

1223
01:33:41,105 --> 01:33:42,319
Mom, know one thing,

1224
01:33:42,788 --> 01:33:46,315
drunkards don't feel bad even
if you don't let them inside the house,

1225
01:33:46,605 --> 01:33:50,661
but if the bar is not open,
they feel very bad.

1226
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:02,450
Superb.

1227
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:03,778
Mom, excuse me.

1228
01:34:08,972 --> 01:34:10,355
Let him come.

1229
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:13,369
He is here.

1230
01:34:58,547 --> 01:35:01,496
Hey, pick it up soon or he'll see it.

1231
01:35:02,669 --> 01:35:03,365
Slowly.

1232
01:35:43,224 --> 01:35:45,246
Are you straight?

1233
01:35:45,326 --> 01:35:48,517
Why are you enjoying with me?

1234
01:35:52,071 --> 01:35:53,765
I can't do it.

1235
01:35:53,845 --> 01:35:57,576
A man kisses a man,
where is the world heading to?

1236
01:36:15,651 --> 01:36:17,582
It is so much fun.

1237
01:36:18,086 --> 01:36:21,576
I found liquor. I am so happy.

1238
01:36:55,081 --> 01:36:56,057
Rani.

1239
01:37:02,799 --> 01:37:03,651
Rani.

1240
01:37:07,763 --> 01:37:08,656
Rani.

1241
01:37:11,189 --> 01:37:13,360
Son-in-law, my daughter is like me.

1242
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:15,193
She doesn't wake up
when you whistle at her.

1243
01:37:15,888 --> 01:37:17,143
Take this rock,

1244
01:37:17,693 --> 01:37:19,122
hit her with it, she will wake up.

1245
01:37:21,054 --> 01:37:23,628
Sir, you?
- Look Gani,

1246
01:37:23,894 --> 01:37:26,111
if you have to talk to your girlfriend,

1247
01:37:26,404 --> 01:37:28,208
you should take her to the balcony

1248
01:37:28,904 --> 01:37:30,846
without anybody's knowledge.

1249
01:37:31,213 --> 01:37:32,585
Get it?

1250
01:37:33,686 --> 01:37:34,774
Uncle,

1251
01:37:35,198 --> 01:37:39,466
you proved the proverb wrong
that said every beautiful girl

1252
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:40,941
has an arrogant father.

1253
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:42,403
Thank you.

1254
01:37:42,483 --> 01:37:47,133
Uncle, you're giving me idea
to take her to the balcony at this age,

1255
01:37:47,213 --> 01:37:50,688
you would've experienced so much, right?

1256
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,101
You would've jumped many compounds.

1257
01:37:53,518 --> 01:37:54,645
No.

1258
01:37:54,947 --> 01:37:58,730
In my time, we didn't know which girl
we're marrying until the wedding date.

1259
01:38:00,727 --> 01:38:04,034
Uncle, you've given me idea
of taking her to the balcony.

1260
01:38:04,638 --> 01:38:06,883
Wake Rani and send her to the balcony.

1261
01:38:07,023 --> 01:38:10,776
I will wait there.
We'll talk for some time.

1262
01:38:10,856 --> 01:38:14,294
Son-in-law, even if you don't wish,

1263
01:38:14,374 --> 01:38:16,337
sorrow will come looking
for you after you get married.

1264
01:38:16,417 --> 01:38:18,180
You don't worry.

1265
01:38:18,464 --> 01:38:23,768
It's late. You'll spoil your health
if you don't sleep now.

1266
01:38:24,143 --> 01:38:26,369
Good night. Sweet dreams.

1267
01:38:26,689 --> 01:38:28,393
Okay, uncle. Dreams.

1268
01:38:28,473 --> 01:38:30,583
Why did you just say 'dreams'?
- You suffer from diabetes,

1269
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:33,093
so sweet is not good for your health.

1270
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:36,061
So, I just said 'Dreams'. Dreams.

1271
01:38:38,314 --> 01:38:39,462
Is he a fool?

1272
01:38:39,542 --> 01:38:42,243
I took his daughter's phone
and texted him to come upstairs.

1273
01:38:42,323 --> 01:38:44,002
He is sending him inside again.

1274
01:38:44,082 --> 01:38:46,329
Boss, yes.
- He has lost his mind.

1275
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:49,810
Sir.
- Yes?

1276
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:53,622
I planned and called him outside,

1277
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:56,057
you sent him inside again.

1278
01:38:56,137 --> 01:38:57,385
How do I kill him?

1279
01:38:57,465 --> 01:38:58,723
How would I know?

1280
01:38:58,803 --> 01:39:01,498
I don't know how, but call him out.

1281
01:39:04,154 --> 01:39:05,125
Idiot.

1282
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:06,582
Listen.
- Yes.

1283
01:39:06,662 --> 01:39:08,331
Did you have dinner?
- Yes, uncle.

1284
01:39:08,411 --> 01:39:10,127
You shouldn't go to
sleep right after dinner.

1285
01:39:10,207 --> 01:39:11,766
No, I wash my hands after having dinner.

1286
01:39:13,003 --> 01:39:14,130
Not that,

1287
01:39:14,285 --> 01:39:15,806
if you walk after having dinner,

1288
01:39:16,062 --> 01:39:18,178
you'll be very healthy.
- Okay.

1289
01:39:18,258 --> 01:39:20,423
You want me to walk to now?
- Yes. - Okay.

1290
01:39:21,321 --> 01:39:24,554
He is advising me as if he
has exercised and made six packs.

1291
01:39:32,277 --> 01:39:36,409
Are you going to beauty competition?
You're a ghost.

1292
01:39:36,794 --> 01:39:39,588
He has to fear seeing you.

1293
01:39:39,668 --> 01:39:41,301
Go.
- Okay.

1294
01:39:41,381 --> 01:39:42,739
It is me.

1295
01:39:44,297 --> 01:39:47,393
Hello? Flicker the lights.

1296
01:39:58,834 --> 01:40:00,775
Go. Come on.

1297
01:41:02,048 --> 01:41:04,897
Hey, who are you?

1298
01:41:11,005 --> 01:41:13,581
Who are you?

1299
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,922
Hey, who are you?

1300
01:41:30,499 --> 01:41:33,541
What is it, Dad?
- Gani, did you see Pratap?

1301
01:41:33,621 --> 01:41:34,951
I don't find him anywhere.

1302
01:41:35,031 --> 01:41:37,836
Are you looking for Pratap
or the bottle he was holding?

1303
01:41:39,109 --> 01:41:41,903
You're right. He had a bottle, right?

1304
01:41:43,084 --> 01:41:45,008
Sniff him, you'll find him.

1305
01:41:52,456 --> 01:41:53,306
Darn it!

1306
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:58,711
Hey.

1307
01:42:01,066 --> 01:42:01,817
Slowly.

1308
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:04,827
Can't you open the door soon?
- Lock the door.

1309
01:42:04,907 --> 01:42:07,871
Ghost, why did you come here?
You should've been there.

1310
01:42:07,951 --> 01:42:11,275
What do you expect me to do?
- What is she saying?

1311
01:42:11,355 --> 01:42:14,192
Since I've come here,
I didn't see even one dead body.

1312
01:42:14,970 --> 01:42:17,232
Ours was a leading
business in Bangalore.

1313
01:42:17,312 --> 01:42:21,291
We're unable to reach the target.
Guys, we have to do something for boss.

1314
01:42:21,666 --> 01:42:23,681
We have to do something!
- Boss!

1315
01:42:23,761 --> 01:42:26,255
I will plan and will kill him.

1316
01:42:26,814 --> 01:42:28,582
Superb expression.

1317
01:42:29,882 --> 01:42:31,723
Open the door soon.

1318
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:34,939
Thank God.

1319
01:42:38,712 --> 01:42:43,304
No, Pratap.

1320
01:42:45,215 --> 01:42:48,394
You shouldn't be selfish.

1321
01:42:48,474 --> 01:42:52,067
You're drinking alone.
Think about your brother-in-law.

1322
01:42:53,958 --> 01:42:55,768
I'll give this bottle to him.

1323
01:42:56,776 --> 01:42:59,378
Let him drink to his stomach content.

1324
01:42:59,543 --> 01:43:02,254
Yes. Brother-in-law,

1325
01:43:02,334 --> 01:43:04,753
hereafter,
I will never drink without you.

1326
01:44:20,528 --> 01:44:23,759
There's something in the box.

1327
01:44:24,293 --> 01:44:27,268
I will surely find out

1328
01:44:27,348 --> 01:44:29,777
what is in the box sooner or later.

1329
01:44:30,428 --> 01:44:33,863
I will try and see it tomorrow.

1330
01:44:58,994 --> 01:45:01,564
I don't want to stay in this house.

1331
01:45:01,644 --> 01:45:04,724
That day Rani, today Pratap has seen it.

1332
01:45:04,804 --> 01:45:08,196
Should we inform them and leave?
- Hey, let's not say anything.

1333
01:45:08,276 --> 01:45:09,659
Let's just leave from here.

1334
01:45:10,101 --> 01:45:12,355
Gani, let's leave this house.

1335
01:45:12,435 --> 01:45:14,178
There's ghost in this house.

1336
01:45:14,258 --> 01:45:15,662
Mom, there's no ghost here.

1337
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:17,200
He's bluffing.

1338
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:19,948
I am not bluffing. I swear by my sister,

1339
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,741
my brother-in-law, and you.
There's a ghost here.

1340
01:45:23,821 --> 01:45:25,848
Is it? Okay, show it to me.

1341
01:45:27,950 --> 01:45:32,399
Is it an animal in the zoo
for me to show it to you?

1342
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:34,204
It was a real ghost.

1343
01:45:34,284 --> 01:45:38,280
Gani, what do we do
if a ghost attacks us?

1344
01:45:38,594 --> 01:45:40,353
Thrash it.

1345
01:45:40,433 --> 01:45:44,766
You're a fight master for 200 films.
- They are actors and fighters.

1346
01:45:44,846 --> 01:45:48,531
They act as if they are fighting.

1347
01:45:48,788 --> 01:45:50,831
But this is original.

1348
01:45:50,911 --> 01:45:52,892
How do we fight with an original ghost?

1349
01:45:52,972 --> 01:45:54,055
Dad...

1350
01:45:54,522 --> 01:45:57,545
You can't fight with original ghost.

1351
01:45:58,287 --> 01:46:04,222
But, you can thrash the people
who are enacting like ghost, right?

1352
01:46:15,993 --> 01:46:19,163
We have to know who is behind it
and what their intentions are.

1353
01:46:19,283 --> 01:46:21,324
Catch them and handover them to me.

1354
01:46:22,103 --> 01:46:25,767
I will smash their face,
they'll reveal the truth.

1355
01:46:25,847 --> 01:46:31,363
Dad, if you smash their face, they won't
reveal the truth, but they'll bleed.

1356
01:46:31,443 --> 01:46:32,912
Let it be.

1357
01:46:32,992 --> 01:46:37,089
I am getting angry
as they are doing this.

1358
01:46:37,169 --> 01:46:41,605
Dad, sit under the fan,
you'll feel relaxed. - Darn it!

1359
01:46:41,786 --> 01:46:43,776
I can't even deliver a movie dialogue.

1360
01:46:43,856 --> 01:46:45,653
Your son counter attacks me.

1361
01:46:46,488 --> 01:46:50,399
I salute you.

1362
01:46:52,287 --> 01:46:54,659
Is this the time to do comedy?

1363
01:46:55,538 --> 01:46:56,482
Uncle,

1364
01:46:57,783 --> 01:46:59,056
ghost!
- Hey!

1365
01:47:02,006 --> 01:47:05,432
Since we've come here, I'm
expecting that you'd do something big.

1366
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:08,647
I don't see anything.
- Sir, look at my eyes.

1367
01:47:09,545 --> 01:47:11,184
I haven't slept for three days.

1368
01:47:11,264 --> 01:47:14,307
I am spending sleepless nights

1369
01:47:14,387 --> 01:47:16,661
and have made three plans.
- Is it?

1370
01:47:17,202 --> 01:47:20,316
I will surely be successful this time.
- Sure.

1371
01:47:20,947 --> 01:47:22,863
What are you cooking today,
chicken or mutton?

1372
01:47:23,259 --> 01:47:25,440
Oh, was it private?
- Nothing of that sort.

1373
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:29,549
I was asking sir to give me contract
for all the functions in his house.

1374
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:32,003
You don't even know how to cook Maggie.

1375
01:47:32,205 --> 01:47:33,598
You want him to give
you marriage contract?

1376
01:47:33,678 --> 01:47:34,761
You eat maggie after you die.

1377
01:47:34,841 --> 01:47:39,771
You look like a contract killer to me.

1378
01:47:39,851 --> 01:47:41,063
How did he know?

1379
01:47:42,914 --> 01:47:45,689
He always used to react,
why are you reacting today?

1380
01:47:46,623 --> 01:47:48,207
According to the marriage schedule,

1381
01:47:48,287 --> 01:47:50,122
what is the program today?
- Actually...

1382
01:47:50,202 --> 01:47:51,850
I will tell you.
- He is here.

1383
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:53,520
Today we will sing and dance.

1384
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:54,878
Tomorrow is the wedding.

1385
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:57,010
Am I right, father-in-law?
- Idiot.

1386
01:47:58,925 --> 01:48:03,303
Sir, why did your face suddenly
become sullen like a stretched elastic?

1387
01:48:03,383 --> 01:48:06,436
Sir is worried about the wedding.
- Oh, wedding tension.

1388
01:48:06,516 --> 01:48:11,336
Don't take any tension, I will
make sure everything goes on smoothly.

1389
01:48:11,416 --> 01:48:15,198
I will arrange for song,
dance, and everything else.

1390
01:48:16,034 --> 01:48:17,415
Sir, give me a high-five!

1391
01:50:06,510 --> 01:50:09,048
The spirit that has
been tied with mantras,

1392
01:50:09,128 --> 01:50:11,521
it is escape if the
moonlight falls on it.

1393
01:50:11,601 --> 01:50:14,416
Before the full moon light falls on it,

1394
01:50:14,496 --> 01:50:15,955
we have to get the box from there.

1395
01:51:33,549 --> 01:51:36,932
I think he died. - Check whether
he is carrying country liquor.

1396
01:51:37,574 --> 01:51:39,424
Brother-in-law, you check.

1397
01:51:39,805 --> 01:51:41,579
You check.
- No, you check.

1398
01:51:41,659 --> 01:51:43,711
You check.
- No, you check. You're a fight master.

1399
01:51:43,791 --> 01:51:45,845
Listen to your master. Check.

1400
01:51:45,925 --> 01:51:48,703
I am scared.
- Come on.

1401
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,331
Be careful.

1402
01:51:57,881 --> 01:52:00,474
Brother-in-law!

1403
01:52:00,554 --> 01:52:02,434
It's not a country liquor,
but foreign brand.

1404
01:52:02,514 --> 01:52:04,907
Really? I found it.
- No, I found it.

1405
01:52:04,987 --> 01:52:08,086
I'll give you potato chips,
let go of it.

1406
01:52:08,166 --> 01:52:09,955
I will give egg patties. Let it go.

1407
01:52:10,523 --> 01:52:13,060
Okay, let it be 50-50.
- 50-50?

1408
01:52:13,573 --> 01:52:15,707
That's not possible.

1409
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:20,022
Let it be 30-60.
- 30-60.

1410
01:52:20,102 --> 01:52:22,303
60-60.

1411
01:52:25,564 --> 01:52:26,902
We're so lucky.

1412
01:52:26,982 --> 01:52:28,166
Okay.

1413
01:52:30,493 --> 01:52:31,830
He is here.

1414
01:52:36,539 --> 01:52:38,026
Team B, he entered.

1415
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:37,091
Why do I see everything double?

1416
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:33,504
Idiot!
- I will thrash you.

1417
01:56:33,584 --> 01:56:34,867
Who are you, idiot?

1418
01:56:34,947 --> 01:56:37,043
It is me.
- Sorry, sir.

1419
01:56:37,123 --> 01:56:40,649
I told you to kill him,
you've planned to kill me.

1420
01:56:40,729 --> 01:56:42,126
Sir, what did I do?

1421
01:56:42,206 --> 01:56:45,320
Why did you send that boy to scare me?

1422
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:47,965
Boy? - Who was the boy
who ran from the cupboard?

1423
01:56:48,045 --> 01:56:50,324
We don't have a child artist
in our company.

1424
01:56:53,713 --> 01:56:58,030
Think carefully.
- Sir, there must be a confusion.

1425
01:56:58,110 --> 01:56:59,553
You go to sleep peacefully.

1426
01:56:59,919 --> 01:57:02,221
I will give you good news
in the morning.

1427
01:57:05,392 --> 01:57:07,442
Who is the child artist?

1428
01:57:31,625 --> 01:57:34,201
You both? Don't you have any time sense?

1429
01:57:34,281 --> 01:57:35,724
You get started anywhere.

1430
01:57:37,545 --> 01:57:38,621
Where did you find the liquor?

1431
01:57:38,701 --> 01:57:40,614
There was a foreigner here.

1432
01:57:40,694 --> 01:57:44,793
I thought he was a thief
and knocked him out.

1433
01:57:45,182 --> 01:57:46,923
He had this with him, so I robbed it.

1434
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:49,087
Why did the foreigner come here?

1435
01:57:53,851 --> 01:57:57,504
Hello, idiots.
They are doing flickering.

1436
01:57:57,584 --> 01:58:02,359
You don't do it when I ask you to.
Do it more.

1437
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:08,680
The one who went inside,
is she Pinky or Pankaja?

1438
01:58:08,909 --> 01:58:11,199
Why is she going there?

1439
01:58:21,137 --> 01:58:24,847
You wretched woman,
why are you scaring me?

1440
01:58:24,927 --> 01:58:28,007
Oh, why are you coming from there?
Who are you? - I came looking for you.

1441
01:58:28,087 --> 01:58:30,149
Did you come looking for me?
- Yes.

1442
01:58:30,905 --> 01:58:33,080
Who was the woman who went there?

1443
01:58:33,298 --> 01:58:35,978
You're confusing me so much.

1444
01:58:36,058 --> 01:58:37,787
How can I run business..

1445
01:58:37,867 --> 01:58:40,687
Why?
- He's coming this way.

1446
01:58:40,767 --> 01:58:42,252
He is here.
- Stay quiet.

1447
01:58:42,985 --> 01:58:44,977
Look, I will be in that room,

1448
01:58:45,057 --> 01:58:46,933
get him there.

1449
01:58:47,210 --> 01:58:48,676
I will kill him.

1450
01:59:52,454 --> 01:59:54,779
Car? Come this way.

1451
01:59:59,152 --> 02:00:00,687
It's a Ferrari.

1452
02:00:01,821 --> 02:00:03,607
The battery is charged.

1453
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:05,920
How did it come here?

1454
02:00:07,042 --> 02:00:10,534
Hey, you don't turn it on and off
when I tell you to.

1455
02:00:10,614 --> 02:00:13,030
Now you're doing it. Where are you?

1456
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:14,633
Hello..

1457
02:00:23,056 --> 02:00:24,389
Oh no!

1458
02:00:26,862 --> 02:00:28,511
Hey!

1459
02:00:33,743 --> 02:00:35,518
Hey, come here.

1460
02:00:36,879 --> 02:00:38,792
Take this.

1461
02:00:39,319 --> 02:00:41,690
Do you want me to play with it?
- Not to play with it,

1462
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:44,209
but to go on a long drive
with your husband.

1463
02:00:44,289 --> 02:00:46,270
Go and sit there.

1464
02:01:04,098 --> 02:01:07,625
Why are you facing that side?

1465
02:01:10,659 --> 02:01:12,617
Don't play drama with me.

1466
02:01:12,697 --> 02:01:15,663
Show me your face, come on.

1467
02:01:16,808 --> 02:01:18,777
Go to Gandhinagar and do this acting.

1468
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:21,136
You will earn nice money.

1469
02:01:21,216 --> 02:01:22,842
You!

1470
02:01:23,059 --> 02:01:25,338
Hey, how many of you are here?

1471
02:01:25,968 --> 02:01:27,629
Why are you doing this?

1472
02:01:27,709 --> 02:01:29,930
Who is with you, tell me?

1473
02:01:37,602 --> 02:01:43,659
I am talking to you,
you are grinding like an old machine.

1474
02:01:43,739 --> 02:01:45,125
Turn!

1475
02:01:50,530 --> 02:01:53,598
Hey, stop!

1476
02:01:53,815 --> 02:01:55,510
Hey, stop!

1477
02:01:57,056 --> 02:01:58,751
Who told her to come in the middle?

1478
02:01:59,151 --> 02:02:00,719
I missed him.

1479
02:02:05,335 --> 02:02:06,995
He locked the door.

1480
02:02:09,845 --> 02:02:12,582
Ferrari car is going in full speed.

1481
02:02:18,284 --> 02:02:21,445
I didn't give this boy the ID card.
I will teach him a lesson.

1482
02:02:21,525 --> 02:02:22,956
Hey, child artist.

1483
02:02:24,994 --> 02:02:27,832
Hey! Why did you scare sir?

1484
02:02:28,063 --> 02:02:29,998
He is on our side.

1485
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:33,787
Whose son are you? Pinky or Pankaja?

1486
02:02:34,051 --> 02:02:36,329
Where is your mother?
- There.

1487
02:02:36,558 --> 02:02:38,379
Who is he pointing finger at?

1488
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:43,645
Wretched woman,
what are you doing up there?

1489
02:02:43,725 --> 02:02:46,805
I asked you to scare him,
but you got scared and climbed up.

1490
02:02:47,298 --> 02:02:50,893
Had you cooperated,
I would've killed him.

1491
02:02:50,973 --> 02:02:53,675
I won't give you any money today.

1492
02:02:54,844 --> 02:02:57,179
You're overacting now.

1493
02:02:58,726 --> 02:03:04,050
What is it? You're making such
sound when I said I won't pay you.

1494
02:03:04,601 --> 02:03:06,639
No!

1495
02:03:10,693 --> 02:03:14,288
Why isn't this Ferrari not stopping?

1496
02:03:18,113 --> 02:03:21,903
Hey, why are you doing so?
I will pay you.

1497
02:03:27,251 --> 02:03:32,095
Hey, why are you hitting me?
I am bleeding. You!

1498
02:03:35,358 --> 02:03:38,930
Hey, did you learn magic so soon?

1499
02:03:41,770 --> 02:03:44,106
Hey, where are you?

1500
02:03:45,412 --> 02:03:48,652
Why are you beating me?

1501
02:03:48,892 --> 02:03:50,484
Come before me.

1502
02:03:54,778 --> 02:03:57,480
Why are you scaring me?

1503
02:04:02,747 --> 02:04:05,347
Why are you shaking the book stand?

1504
02:04:15,353 --> 02:04:17,830
Oh no!

1505
02:04:18,376 --> 02:04:19,967
Hey!

1506
02:04:37,201 --> 02:04:40,888
There's a ghost in this house.

1507
02:04:41,472 --> 02:04:44,381
Everyone leave from here.

1508
02:04:46,843 --> 02:04:52,305
This is too much. Is it him?

1509
02:04:52,877 --> 02:04:56,094
God knows what he
will ask me to make now.

1510
02:04:56,781 --> 02:04:58,728
I knew.

1511
02:04:59,038 --> 02:05:00,950
What did I tell you?

1512
02:05:01,706 --> 02:05:03,431
I asked you to get fritters

1513
02:05:03,767 --> 02:05:06,675
with red chilli chutney,

1514
02:05:06,755 --> 02:05:09,240
you applied oil to your head
and spiked your hair,

1515
02:05:09,435 --> 02:05:12,172
you've applied the red chilli chutney
on your face. Don't you feel ashamed!

1516
02:05:12,252 --> 02:05:14,450
You think this is red chilli chutney?

1517
02:05:15,503 --> 02:05:16,190
Yes, sir.

1518
02:05:16,270 --> 02:05:20,621
If you continue to do drama,
I will give you a gate pass.

1519
02:05:20,701 --> 02:05:23,929
Why are you talking to him? Fire him.
- Before you give me gate pass,

1520
02:05:24,009 --> 02:05:26,460
there's a woman inside who
has a pass to send you to hell.

1521
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:28,875
I can't help it.
- What did you say?

1522
02:05:29,574 --> 02:05:31,852
Sir, if you get me a gate pass,

1523
02:05:32,390 --> 02:05:35,345
I won't have money even to go by bus.
- Okay.

1524
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:37,657
Where have you kept the oil can?
Is it in the kitchen?

1525
02:05:39,408 --> 02:05:41,401
Sir, the vaastu is not good.

1526
02:05:41,641 --> 02:05:43,966
I shifted everything.

1527
02:05:44,046 --> 02:05:45,580
Come on. Let's go.
- Go.

1528
02:05:45,946 --> 02:05:49,119
Go. - Did you see
how I have kept him under control?

1529
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:54,295
I got spikes,

1530
02:05:54,788 --> 02:05:57,364
I don't know what hairstyle
she will give him.

1531
02:06:01,143 --> 02:06:04,942
"We both are locked in a room."

1532
02:06:05,022 --> 02:06:07,520
"The keys get lost."

1533
02:06:08,074 --> 02:06:12,499
We don't get a chance.
My darling.

1534
02:06:46,419 --> 02:06:47,335
What happened?

1535
02:06:47,415 --> 02:06:49,808
In the room...

1536
02:06:49,888 --> 02:06:53,930
Calm down. Don't fear.

1537
02:06:54,445 --> 02:06:55,635
Come with me.

1538
02:06:57,468 --> 02:06:58,801
I am scared.
- You don't fear.

1539
02:06:58,881 --> 02:07:02,094
I am with you. Okay?
Calm down.

1540
02:07:04,544 --> 02:07:05,678
You look like a wild boar.

1541
02:07:05,758 --> 02:07:07,590
Why have you applied tomato ketchup?

1542
02:07:07,670 --> 02:07:12,170
Sir. I swear, it is not tomato ketchup,
but original blood.

1543
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:14,071
There's a ghost in the house.

1544
02:07:14,151 --> 02:07:15,557
That bought me to this condition.

1545
02:07:15,637 --> 02:07:18,125
Come on, let's run away from here.
- Hey.

1546
02:07:18,426 --> 02:07:21,377
Those are not branded ghosts,

1547
02:07:21,629 --> 02:07:23,965
they are duplicate.
- Oh.

1548
02:07:24,135 --> 02:07:27,606
Someone is playing games with us.

1549
02:07:27,801 --> 02:07:30,595
If I get my hands on him..
- Leave my hand.

1550
02:07:30,675 --> 02:07:34,778
I will hack him to pieces
and decorate my house.

1551
02:07:34,858 --> 02:07:37,859
I won't spare that scoundrel.
- Ma'am, ask him to let me go.

1552
02:07:39,046 --> 02:07:41,668
Boss.
- You want me to let you go?

1553
02:07:41,748 --> 02:07:44,370
Boss.
- What is it?

1554
02:07:44,450 --> 02:07:48,366
Boss, you're here?
Seetha is refusing to act like a ghost.

1555
02:07:48,801 --> 02:07:51,664
I asked her the reason.
She said, her dates are over,

1556
02:07:51,744 --> 02:07:54,858
she demands for extra payment.

1557
02:07:55,327 --> 02:07:58,281
In that case how can we kill Gani?

1558
02:07:58,361 --> 02:08:00,628
Tell him we'll pay Rs. 3000 extra.

1559
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:05,313
You're paying her Rs. 3000
to just walk up and down.

1560
02:08:05,393 --> 02:08:08,564
You're paying me only Rs. 300
for working so much.

1561
02:08:08,756 --> 02:08:11,050
Hey, who is the manager?

1562
02:08:11,737 --> 02:08:14,359
Go!
- Boss, escape!

1563
02:08:14,783 --> 02:08:16,569
I don't know who he is.

1564
02:08:16,649 --> 02:08:19,649
He has got possessed
watching horror movies.

1565
02:08:19,729 --> 02:08:20,978
He is a fraudster.

1566
02:08:21,058 --> 02:08:23,360
I don't know him. Please, believe me.
- Hey,

1567
02:08:23,909 --> 02:08:26,543
I didn't believe him
when he said all that.

1568
02:08:26,623 --> 02:08:29,474
Seeing you shake like this,
I came to know

1569
02:08:29,681 --> 02:08:32,987
that you're the reason for all this.
You scoundrel!

1570
02:08:33,067 --> 02:08:36,620
Why did you do that?
- Hey!

1571
02:08:39,139 --> 02:08:42,093
Catch him!
- Where do I go?

1572
02:08:43,730 --> 02:08:46,673
Hey, open the door.

1573
02:08:46,753 --> 02:08:54,150
Father-in-law!

1574
02:08:57,368 --> 02:08:59,223
Who is it at this hour?

1575
02:09:02,371 --> 02:09:05,284
Father-in-law, I saw the ghost.

1576
02:09:05,612 --> 02:09:07,306
Dad, there's a ghost.

1577
02:09:09,469 --> 02:09:11,908
Did it come to your room?
I'll call and tell it not to come.

1578
02:09:11,988 --> 02:09:14,714
Idiot!
- Hey! - Is it a cab

1579
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:18,573
for you to book it and then cancel it?
You're mad.

1580
02:09:21,184 --> 02:09:24,322
Ghost!

1581
02:09:24,402 --> 02:09:27,322
Ghost!
- Where is it?

1582
02:09:32,841 --> 02:09:36,059
Who is it? Is anyone here?

1583
02:09:50,944 --> 02:09:52,318
Is anyone here?

1584
02:09:54,178 --> 02:09:55,444
Who is it?

1585
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:21,438
Gani? Did you find the thief?
- No, did you find him?

1586
02:10:21,518 --> 02:10:22,731
Where did he go?

1587
02:10:22,811 --> 02:10:24,231
Did he escape?

1588
02:10:24,311 --> 02:10:26,671
You all are here?

1589
02:10:26,751 --> 02:10:28,686
I cooked food for everyone.

1590
02:10:28,766 --> 02:10:31,228
The stupid cook hasn't
cooked anything today.

1591
02:10:31,754 --> 02:10:34,960
He had come here to murder,
why will he cook food?

1592
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:38,614
Murder?
- The chef is doing all this.

1593
02:10:38,694 --> 02:10:39,999
I didn't do anything.

1594
02:10:40,079 --> 02:10:43,343
Brother-in-law, what are you saying?
Gani, is it true?

1595
02:10:45,702 --> 02:10:48,095
Couldn't the phone ring after some time?

1596
02:10:49,159 --> 02:10:51,301
Whose phone is ringing?

1597
02:10:56,350 --> 02:10:57,873
Hey!

1598
02:10:57,953 --> 02:11:00,289
It's not me.
- Come on, hit him.

1599
02:11:00,369 --> 02:11:03,483
Come on, thrash him.
How dare you do that?

1600
02:11:05,007 --> 02:11:06,404
It's not me.

1601
02:11:07,457 --> 02:11:10,377
Don't touch my phone.
- Hey, move your hand.

1602
02:11:10,457 --> 02:11:13,286
How dare you lie to us? Hold him.

1603
02:11:15,607 --> 02:11:18,159
How dare you do that?

1604
02:11:18,552 --> 02:11:20,667
Don't answer the phone please.
- Stay here.

1605
02:11:21,792 --> 02:11:22,892
You idiot,

1606
02:11:23,189 --> 02:11:25,560
why do you send the ghost to my room?

1607
02:11:28,227 --> 02:11:31,170
I gave you contract to kill Gani.

1608
02:11:33,472 --> 02:11:34,568
Oh no.

1609
02:11:36,701 --> 02:11:38,545
I don't know what you do,

1610
02:11:39,014 --> 02:11:40,761
you have to kill him.

1611
02:11:43,228 --> 02:11:44,786
Look, I am not bothered.

1612
02:11:44,866 --> 02:11:47,557
No wedding will take place.
You hang up the phone.

1613
02:11:52,709 --> 02:11:54,678
Mom, just check on her.
- Okay.

1614
02:11:55,778 --> 02:11:58,583
Rani, stop.
- I will escape.

1615
02:11:59,488 --> 02:12:02,007
Gani, what is this?
I don't understand anything.

1616
02:12:02,407 --> 02:12:05,304
I had a doubt on him
since we had come here.

1617
02:13:09,118 --> 02:13:12,270
Oh, please let me go.
Don't hit me. Please don't hit me.

1618
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:17,855
Hey, we're the fans of Vishnuwardhan
who killed Nagavalli to save his friends.

1619
02:13:17,935 --> 02:13:20,615
You tried to fool us by scaring us.

1620
02:13:20,695 --> 02:13:23,784
Look, you can take me out of the house
and hit me as much as you want.

1621
02:13:23,864 --> 02:13:26,019
There's a ghost in this house.

1622
02:13:26,099 --> 02:13:29,248
How dare you lie to a man
who's worked in cinema? How dare you!

1623
02:13:29,328 --> 02:13:31,836
How dare you lie to me!
- Sir, please.

1624
02:13:31,916 --> 02:13:35,030
How dare you?
- Child artist, your scene is over.

1625
02:13:35,110 --> 02:13:37,183
Go.
- Pratap, you handle him,

1626
02:13:37,263 --> 02:13:39,473
I will go catch that boy.
- Okay, brother-in-law.

1627
02:13:39,553 --> 02:13:42,489
Why did you do that?

1628
02:13:44,556 --> 02:13:47,980
Hey, kiddo. Where are you?

1629
02:13:48,255 --> 02:13:49,778
Come out.

1630
02:13:49,858 --> 02:13:51,438
You're a good boy, right?

1631
02:13:51,518 --> 02:13:54,667
If you come out,
I will give you ice-cream,

1632
02:13:55,033 --> 02:13:59,533
pizza, burger, a new shirt,
pant,

1633
02:13:59,613 --> 02:14:02,384
a bat to play with,
and give you everything.

1634
02:14:02,464 --> 02:14:06,022
If you don't come out, I will...

1635
02:14:18,346 --> 02:14:20,911
What is it? Who is it?

1636
02:14:21,541 --> 02:14:24,736
I told you I'll buy you a bat,
but you're hitting me with a bat.

1637
02:14:31,571 --> 02:14:34,033
Do you think my back is Hebbal flyover?

1638
02:14:34,113 --> 02:14:35,785
You're walking on my back.

1639
02:14:41,212 --> 02:14:42,391
Where are you?

1640
02:14:55,502 --> 02:14:56,991
Where did he go?

1641
02:15:09,069 --> 02:15:10,125
Father-in-law,

1642
02:15:12,678 --> 02:15:14,270
I learnt everything.

1643
02:15:15,667 --> 02:15:17,694
I learnt the drama you did.

1644
02:15:19,743 --> 02:15:23,990
You look like a teddy bear.

1645
02:15:24,312 --> 02:15:28,978
But you are so poisonous within.

1646
02:15:29,327 --> 02:15:30,781
Remember one thing,

1647
02:15:31,926 --> 02:15:33,701
God gives

1648
02:15:34,423 --> 02:15:38,911
money, fame, wealth, and support
of the people to the people who cheat.

1649
02:15:39,529 --> 02:15:43,422
He doesn't give anything
to honest people like us.

1650
02:15:43,605 --> 02:15:45,403
But God stands beside us

1651
02:15:45,483 --> 02:15:48,083
and bless us and support us.

1652
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:50,018
The same thing happened here.

1653
02:15:50,716 --> 02:15:52,037
The same thing happened here!

1654
02:15:53,132 --> 02:15:57,403
You cheated us,
so He punished you.

1655
02:15:59,441 --> 02:16:01,988
I loved from my heart,

1656
02:16:02,395 --> 02:16:04,003
He saved me.

1657
02:16:05,934 --> 02:16:08,865
Look at you now,
how you're sitting.

1658
02:16:09,575 --> 02:16:13,835
You got paralyzed and immobilized.

1659
02:16:19,193 --> 02:16:21,083
Why are you showing me the cupboard?

1660
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:24,586
Oh, do you want to show me
how much money you have?

1661
02:16:24,987 --> 02:16:26,808
You keep the money with you.

1662
02:16:27,071 --> 02:16:28,915
I don't value money.

1663
02:16:29,316 --> 02:16:33,804
I value only love.
To hell with your money!

1664
02:16:40,445 --> 02:16:43,170
Hey, what is it?
- Gani.

1665
02:16:43,502 --> 02:16:46,972
There's a ghost.
- You coward. Go away!

1666
02:16:47,407 --> 02:16:49,319
Who are you trying to scare?

1667
02:16:49,399 --> 02:16:51,865
Gani.
- Sir,

1668
02:16:53,143 --> 02:16:55,822
you got your daughter
married to a coward.

1669
02:16:56,738 --> 02:17:01,158
You tried to get
a brave man like me killed.

1670
02:17:02,497 --> 02:17:04,856
Do you know how much I love Rani?

1671
02:17:05,932 --> 02:17:06,989
You won't understand.

1672
02:17:09,436 --> 02:17:12,322
Look, I've got her name tattooed.

1673
02:17:12,722 --> 02:17:14,646
Not just Rani.

1674
02:17:16,501 --> 02:17:20,142
I am taking care of it
more than Rani.

1675
02:17:21,527 --> 02:17:23,377
I love her so much.

1676
02:17:23,599 --> 02:17:26,199
I don't know how to make you understand.

1677
02:17:28,615 --> 02:17:30,229
How do I tell you?

1678
02:17:30,836 --> 02:17:32,165
Where did he go?

1679
02:17:33,447 --> 02:17:35,210
He was paralyzed. How did he move?

1680
02:17:38,874 --> 02:17:41,428
Hey! Who are you?

1681
02:17:44,050 --> 02:17:45,870
What kind of people are you?

1682
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:47,714
You're scaring us by sending
actors disguised as ghosts.

1683
02:17:47,794 --> 02:17:52,558
Don't you feel ashamed?
- There's a real ghost in this house.

1684
02:17:53,611 --> 02:17:55,718
Go and save your son.

1685
02:17:56,267 --> 02:17:58,157
Gani?
- Gani!

1686
02:17:59,244 --> 02:18:03,744
All the other women
wear makeup and want to be in style.

1687
02:18:04,362 --> 02:18:06,767
Why have you painted
yourself in white colour?

1688
02:18:07,064 --> 02:18:08,323
Gani!
- Gani!

1689
02:18:09,710 --> 02:18:13,259
Ma'am, what happened to your teeth?

1690
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:15,528
It is so black in colour.

1691
02:18:15,972 --> 02:18:18,397
Stop doing drama, get down.

1692
02:18:18,743 --> 02:18:20,147
Take your payment and go home.

1693
02:18:20,227 --> 02:18:21,423
Your husband and children
must be waiting for you.

1694
02:18:21,503 --> 02:18:22,579
Get down!

1695
02:18:24,309 --> 02:18:26,301
Gani!
- Gani!

1696
02:18:26,381 --> 02:18:27,644
Come out.
- What is it, mom?

1697
02:18:27,724 --> 02:18:29,656
Come out.
- The ghost inside the room is real.

1698
02:18:29,736 --> 02:18:30,904
Come out soon!

1699
02:18:31,099 --> 02:18:33,550
Gani, come on!
- Come out!

1700
02:18:34,363 --> 02:18:35,267
Come on.

1701
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:37,031
Mom, Gani.

1702
02:19:02,636 --> 02:19:04,514
"Let's play the game."
- Brother-in-law!

1703
02:19:04,594 --> 02:19:07,754
"Let's play the game."
- Brother-in-law!

1704
02:19:07,834 --> 02:19:09,346
Brother-in-law!

1705
02:19:09,426 --> 02:19:13,319
"Let's play the game."
- Brother-in-law!

1706
02:19:13,399 --> 02:19:17,336
"My clothes belong to you
and your clothes belong to me."

1707
02:19:17,843 --> 02:19:18,839
Brother-in-law!

1708
02:19:18,919 --> 02:19:21,977
What do you think you're doing here?

1709
02:19:22,057 --> 02:19:24,325
What are you up to?

1710
02:19:24,405 --> 02:19:26,031
We are all tensed. Come on.

1711
02:19:26,275 --> 02:19:29,683
Uncle, I like to play with car.

1712
02:19:29,763 --> 02:19:34,446
Do you like to play too?
- I don't like car, I like bar.

1713
02:19:34,526 --> 02:19:37,000
Stop acting.
Will you come with me or not?

1714
02:19:37,080 --> 02:19:39,680
Uncle, don't make me angry.

1715
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:42,371
You are making me angry
by calling me uncle.

1716
02:19:42,451 --> 02:19:44,878
You are playing with toys.
Get up, brother-in-law!

1717
02:19:57,256 --> 02:19:59,523
Uncle, why are you sitting there?

1718
02:19:59,603 --> 02:20:02,649
I can't come there. Come down.

1719
02:20:02,729 --> 02:20:04,928
Brother-in-law!
- Uncle, come on, let's play.

1720
02:20:05,008 --> 02:20:08,283
Let's play with the car. Come on.
- No.

1721
02:20:08,820 --> 02:20:10,835
I will drive the car on you.

1722
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:18,884
Uncle, let's play.

1723
02:20:27,426 --> 02:20:32,900
Shall we play kabaddi?
Kabaddi... Shall we play kabaddi?

1724
02:20:32,980 --> 02:20:36,174
Only two players can't play kabaddi.
Shall I go and get other players too?

1725
02:20:36,254 --> 02:20:38,534
Will you draw a boundary line here?

1726
02:20:38,751 --> 02:20:43,893
Okay.
- Go.

1727
02:20:51,391 --> 02:20:53,292
He is possessed.

1728
02:20:55,433 --> 02:20:57,174
I am driving a car.

1729
02:20:57,254 --> 02:20:58,314
Dear...

1730
02:21:08,567 --> 02:21:10,159
I am driving a car.

1731
02:21:12,747 --> 02:21:14,133
Where are we going?

1732
02:21:16,755 --> 02:21:18,232
I am hiding somewhere.

1733
02:21:23,866 --> 02:21:26,376
Where I am? Find me.
- I can hear his voice from here.

1734
02:21:34,398 --> 02:21:36,648
"Black sheep, have you any wool?"

1735
02:21:36,728 --> 02:21:39,495
"If you give me,
I will give you two bags full."

1736
02:21:39,575 --> 02:21:43,125
"If you don't give me, I will hit you."

1737
02:21:43,205 --> 02:21:44,912
Dad!

1738
02:21:52,995 --> 02:21:54,026
Dad?

1739
02:23:35,207 --> 02:23:38,849
If you don't leave my son,
I won't spare her!

1740
02:23:40,749 --> 02:23:43,900
If you don't leave my son,
I won't spare you!

1741
02:23:53,254 --> 02:23:56,036
Rani?

1742
02:23:56,517 --> 02:23:58,521
You go away!

1743
02:23:59,425 --> 02:24:02,093
Sir, it is asking you to
open the box.

1744
02:24:02,173 --> 02:24:05,906
Please open the box.
- Until the boy's spirit is with us,

1745
02:24:06,535 --> 02:24:07,898
it will listen to us.

1746
02:24:08,413 --> 02:24:11,493
If I let it free, it can do anything.

1747
02:24:11,573 --> 02:24:15,066
Sir, please save my daughter.

1748
02:24:17,012 --> 02:24:18,661
You will be blessed.

1749
02:24:37,611 --> 02:24:42,283
Gani.
- Gani.

1750
02:24:42,363 --> 02:24:46,325
Gani.
- Gani.

1751
02:24:46,405 --> 02:24:51,210
Gani.
- Gani.

1752
02:24:51,290 --> 02:24:54,720
Gani.
- Gani.

1753
02:24:54,984 --> 02:24:58,784
Gani.
- Gani.

1754
02:25:02,048 --> 02:25:03,911
Gani.
- Gani.

1755
02:25:16,542 --> 02:25:17,998
Gani.

1756
02:25:19,118 --> 02:25:20,240
Gani!

1757
02:25:21,339 --> 02:25:24,168
Sir.
- The spirits are trying to misguide me.

1758
02:25:24,248 --> 02:25:27,637
Only you can recognise
that girl's voice.

1759
02:25:27,717 --> 02:25:31,343
I will give you my powers
and send you there, will you go?

1760
02:25:31,423 --> 02:25:34,919
No. - Sir, I will go.
- You have to save the girl

1761
02:25:34,999 --> 02:25:39,348
and get her back in a very little time.
If not, you both will die.

1762
02:25:42,005 --> 02:25:43,621
No problem, I will go.

1763
02:25:43,701 --> 02:25:45,621
Gani.
- Send me there.

1764
02:26:44,002 --> 02:26:45,273
Gani!

1765
02:26:45,929 --> 02:26:47,265
Gani!

1766
02:26:47,873 --> 02:26:48,914
Gani!

1767
02:26:49,589 --> 02:26:50,895
Gani!

1768
02:26:51,124 --> 02:26:52,395
Gani!

1769
02:28:02,654 --> 02:28:04,136
Gani!
- Gani!

1770
02:28:21,609 --> 02:28:24,586
Goddess Banshankari,
I always worshiped You.

1771
02:28:24,849 --> 02:28:28,072
Why are you testing

1772
02:28:28,547 --> 02:28:30,838
my son and Rani?

1773
02:28:31,605 --> 02:28:33,208
You have to save them.

1774
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:29,463
Gani.

1775
02:30:14,777 --> 02:30:15,783
Gani?

1776
02:30:20,273 --> 02:30:22,927
Goddess Banshankari. Lord Shiva.
- O Goddess. - Gani.

1777
02:30:32,027 --> 02:30:35,349
You overcame all the obstacles.

1778
02:30:44,274 --> 02:30:47,169
Goddess Banshankari, saved us.
- Yes.

1779
02:30:47,815 --> 02:30:49,287
Hail Goddess Banshankari.
