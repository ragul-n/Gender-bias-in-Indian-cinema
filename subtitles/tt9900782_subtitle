1
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:36,597
They always play the same channel!

2
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:39,628
They never switch channels!
-That's enough for me!

3
00:01:40,454 --> 00:01:42,204
Don't waste any of it, alright?
-Here.

4
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:44,313
Quiet in the back!

5
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:51,833
Amudha!
-Is this enough or do you want more?

6
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:53,837
Amudha!

7
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:57,468
Ma'am?
-Come here.

8
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:00,587
Leave the plate.
I'll wash it.

9
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:02,613
Leave it there.
Come here.

10
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,447
Don't play much tonight.

11
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:06,102
Go to bed soon, alright?

12
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:08,298
Why?
-Somebody important is coming...

13
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:09,754
...to visit you tomorrow.

14
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,962
To visit me?
-Yes.

15
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:12,087
Who is it, ma'am?

16
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:14,844
You'll find out when you wake up
tomorrow. Go sleep.

17
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:17,352
Play carefully!
You may fall down and hurt yourselves!

18
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:27,337
Sister! If there are no parents,
who else would come to visit me from home?

19
00:02:27,462 --> 00:02:30,337
Besides parents,
many of the uncles come to visit.

20
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:34,962
And the women they marry. The aunts.
Those kind of people come along.

21
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:37,629
Forgot to mention it.

22
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:40,545
I mentioned everyone.
What if your grandparents are coming?

23
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,504
When they visit tomorrow,
wear some nice clothes.

24
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:48,962
Do you have any?
-Yes, I do.

25
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:40,670
Loosen your hand.

26
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:43,571
Count these, too.
-Alright.

27
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,045
Relax.

28
00:04:00,712 --> 00:04:04,342
Cross-check it and clear the container.
-Alright.

29
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,435
Sir?

30
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:11,174
Sir?

31
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,212
We cracked open a tile.

32
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,920
100% pure cocaine
was concealed in the tile, sir.

33
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:18,045
How many kilograms?
-Almost one ton, sir.

34
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,504
900 kilograms.

35
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,795
It will definitely be worth
over 800 crores, sir.

36
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Undoubtedly the biggest drug bust ever.

37
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,716
Boys!

38
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,212
I don't know how many lives this drug bust
will claim by sunrise.

39
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:38,016
Until I get word from Narayanan
or the OPG head, no one must know of this.

40
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:41,166
That includes your family, too.
-Yes, sir!

41
00:04:41,295 --> 00:04:42,754
Only Thiru's phone stays on.

42
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,670
He must be the only contact person.
-Yes, sir!

43
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:46,490
Take no calls except the ones
that come from my number.

44
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:47,646
-Yes, sir!
-Ok

45
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:50,462
Anbu...
Trust me, Anbu!

46
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:54,754
I gave the signal
as soon as the vehicle crossed the gate!

47
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,295
I'm not at fault!
Don't know how the cops got there, Anbu!

48
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,587
Listen up! My entire cargo's gone!
-I don't know...

49
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:04,087
And you've been blubbering repeatedly
like some raving lunatic!

50
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:07,004
Ask anyone, Anbu!

51
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:09,337
Admit it.

52
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:11,712
I'll spare you.
-I swear upon my son, Anbu!

53
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:13,587
Don't know how things went wrong!

54
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:14,962
Trust me, Anbu!

55
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:17,254
I gave the signal as soon as
the vehicle crossed!

56
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:18,712
Trust me, Anbu!

57
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:20,462
Don't do anything to me, Anbu!

58
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,754
I'm not at fault, Anbu!

59
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,837
Trust me! I gave the signal
as soon as the vehicle crossed!

60
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:25,962
Is Anbu there?

61
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:29,420
Tell him, brother! You know me, right?
-Anbu.

62
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,379
You tell him, brother!
Please!

63
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:33,754
Talk to him.

64
00:05:35,254 --> 00:05:36,254
Who is it?

65
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,110
What gives?
Stumped after giving away all your cocaine?

66
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:40,763
Who are you?

67
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:42,849
I know where your cocaine is.

68
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,295
Adaikalam's younger brother, right?

69
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,837
I need to speak to your older brother.
Set it up.

70
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:50,087
He won't talk.
Tell me if you have a deal in mind.

71
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:53,004
Don't know how the cops came, brother!
I swear!

72
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,329
Please let me go, brother!
I did nothing wrong!

73
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:58,212
I'll tell you where your cocaine is.

74
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:02,254
To ensure the cops don't interfere,
I'll need twenty kilos of it.

75
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:04,587
You know how much twenty kilos
is worth in the market?

76
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:06,587
I don't know
how much twenty kilos is worth.

77
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:09,254
But I know how much 900 kilos
is worth.

78
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,462
I can't do this all by myself.

79
00:06:12,587 --> 00:06:16,754
Narcotics Division. Forest Department.
The Inspector General's Office.

80
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,087
All must be handled!

81
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,379
Plenty of risk at my end!

82
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,313
A lot of people
must be compensated!

83
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:26,087
If twenty kilos is acceptable,
we can talk further.

84
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:29,879
Tell him, man!

85
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:31,462
Please tell him!

86
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:34,295
He gave the signal
when the vehicle crossed, brother!

87
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,212
Yes, I did!
-Really?

88
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:37,337
He gave it, huh?

89
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,337
Never mind twenty.
Take how much ever you want!

90
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:49,129
But I need to know the scumbags
who seized my drugs!

91
00:06:49,254 --> 00:06:50,629
They must die tonight!

92
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:53,629
A cop must consider the consequences
of entering Adaikalam's area!

93
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,420
So must the entire police force!

94
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,212
No one near is picking up, Anbu.

95
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:04,754
The boss's phone is off, too.

96
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:10,920
If my brother still hasn't come yet,
something's up.

97
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:20,195
Has everyone reached
the I.G.'s guesthouse, Paul Pandi?

98
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:22,837
Not yet, sir.

99
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:25,254
They're tricking in one by one.
Yes, sir.

100
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,670
Do you believe someone can become
a millionaire overnight?

101
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,379
Oh, man!
I get it now, sir!

102
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:32,295
This is one such night!

103
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,837
If done right,
you're set for life!

104
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:37,712
Miss even by an inch,
they'll take you and your family out!

105
00:07:37,837 --> 00:07:40,420
Watch it.
-Got it, sir. It won't miss.

106
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,170
What?
-Just a minute.

107
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:49,670
What is your problem?

108
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:51,754
Don't you get it the first time around?

109
00:07:52,754 --> 00:07:54,462
Why call repeatedly
and bother me so?

110
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,129
Bejoy.
The squad head.

111
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,170
His squad
has four men.

112
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,045
Thiru, Sudhakar,
Joseph and Kumaran.

113
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,379
I'll kill those five men before dawn!

114
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:12,629
Send me all their details!
Hello?

115
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:15,295
Hello?
Still there, sir?

116
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,504
Not just five people you must kill.

117
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:22,545
What?
-There is an informant in your gang.

118
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,545
No chance. Every one of them...
-He's there!

119
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:30,295
One of them has been passing information
to Bejoy for two years!

120
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,962
Why bother the hell out of me like this?

121
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:36,462
Sir! Sir! Sir!

122
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:38,587
Their entire cocaine
amounts to 900 kilos!

123
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:40,504
Got any information
about 'Ghost'?

124
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,837
I was saying something.
You're on something else!

125
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,670
Because of the information I gave,
they needlessly killed a man!

126
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:49,330
I have trouble breathing!
Scared I'll get busted, sir!

127
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:51,420
Just listen to me, Ajaz!
-I can't do it anymore!

128
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:53,837
I'll surrender at the nearest precinct!
-Idiot!

129
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,420
Is any of this new to you?

130
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:58,556
You've been undercover
for 26 months!

131
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:00,795
Have you ever seen Adaikalam?

132
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,795
Does anyone even know
what he looks like?

133
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,629
They don't, right?
We've seized 900 kilos!

134
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,712
He must definitely come out
into the open!

135
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,962
One last chance, Ajaz!

136
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:12,212
We've worked for over two years
for this night!

137
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:14,129
How many cops have died?
-Sir...

138
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,640
Please just hear me out, sir...
-Listen, Ajaz!

139
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:19,295
Found out who that man is?

140
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,337
How can that be done
so quickly?

141
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:24,504
They must be tracked.
Many must be interrogated.

142
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:25,879
It's not that easy.

143
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:28,420
Can't take any chances
with it. What do you say?

144
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:30,879
You're right.
Point out the black sheep to me.

145
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,224
I'll slit him up!

146
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:45,295
Hey! Call and find out
if he's in Shankar's hood.

147
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,087
Sure, brother.
-Spare no one who came in yesterday!

148
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,045
Get everyone here now!
-Guys have gone out. We'll get him.

149
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:53,254
Please understand, sir!

150
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:56,420
Please, sir...
-Ajaz!

151
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:58,254
I must know what's going on there!

152
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,837
Report to me whenever you can.
That's a bloody order!

153
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,094
I swear I can't...

154
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:06,629
I'll call you back, dear.

155
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:10,295
Sampath...
-Yes, Anbu?

156
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,254
There is a cop among us.

157
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,795
Do you suspect anyone?

158
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,129
No, Anbu.

159
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,254
There can't be such a thing.
-There is!

160
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:20,379
He takes my grub
and snitches me out!

161
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:25,712
What do we do?
-Call in everyone from our gang tonight.

162
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:27,670
I know who the five cops are.

163
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:30,254
We must deliver their heads
to the station by tonight!

164
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,118
Alright, I'll take care of it.

165
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:34,837
Hey, Chandra!
-Tell me, Sampath!

166
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:37,712
Gather around, everyone!
-Wait! Let me stack these up!

167
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,379
Drop it and come here!

168
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,087
Need a quick chat!
Come here, guys!

169
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:46,129
Did a brown container with the number plate
'TN-45 KA-9072' come this way?

170
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:47,462
Just a minute.

171
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:48,657
Yes! It did, sir!

172
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:50,349
When did it cross by?
-7 PM.

173
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:57,254
Pull over.

174
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,379
Where's the file
of that motel case?

175
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,629
The Inspector will ask for it
first thing in the morning! Have it up?

176
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,545
I've filled it up.
Look it over anyway.

177
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,087
Alright, I'll check it up.

178
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:19,696
I'll get going, sir.
-Alright.

179
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:25,962
Greetings, sir.

180
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:29,305
My name is Napoleon. I'm a constable
from the Tirunelveli district.

181
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:32,251
I need to see Mr. Manickavel.
Just got transferred here.

182
00:11:32,337 --> 00:11:34,379
Need to know which station
I'm posted...

183
00:11:34,504 --> 00:11:36,629
Oh, you're that guy. He talked about it.
-Yes.

184
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:39,670
Why did you come at night?
-Didn't expect it to be this far, sir.

185
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:41,629
Should I be on duty
for tomorrow?

186
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:43,670
Hey!
Who are you?

187
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:45,629
Slapping people
in the police station!

188
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:48,295
Is that your sister?
-He guessed right!

189
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,295
Keep laughing
and I'll break your teeth!

190
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,670
I'm lenient
because you're just students!

191
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:55,337
Sir?
-What is it?

192
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:58,212
They're from my college.
Friends of mine.

193
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:00,337
Came to pick them up?
-"Pick them up"?

194
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:02,837
Is this is a school?
Do you know what they did?

195
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:06,087
They got drunk and were dancing
to loud music on the railway platform!

196
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:08,837
Got a complaint from the control room
and brought them here!

197
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,587
Sit down. Take it up with the Inspector
when he gets here!

198
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:14,861
He knows the Inspector, sir...
-Everyone says that! Sit down!

199
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,240
Sit in the corner!
-Come, Tamizh!

200
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:23,790
Just that it's been two years since
the new Commissioner's office was built.

201
00:12:23,852 --> 00:12:26,536
The Chief Minister hasn't inaugurated it.
So, it's still closed!

202
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:30,062
Sir!

203
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:31,712
Belongs to those kids, sir!

204
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:33,129
Ah, I see.

205
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:35,712
The higher-ups have gone
for an urgent meeting.

206
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:38,087
It'll be a while for them to get back.
Go have a seat.

207
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:39,212
Alright.

208
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:47,810
Sir! They may assign you to a rural area.
Ask for a posting in the city!

209
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,089
Money will flow! Even if it's
your last kickback, you'd get plenty!

210
00:12:55,837 --> 00:12:56,837
Tamizh...

211
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,170
Tamizh...

212
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,670
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,587
It has crossed, sir!

214
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,337
At what time?
-8:30 PM, sir.

215
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,129
The crossing time at four toll booths
is accurate!

216
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:16,587
Only between the fourth and fifth booth,
it took two hours, sir.

217
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,712
Alright, hang up.

218
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:32,545
Good evening, sir.

219
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:37,212
What's wrong with your hand, sir?
-Small accident this morning.

220
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:41,004
Still on duty or are you off?
-I wrapped up duty and was heading home.

221
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:44,670
On the way, I saw a constable
from the station yelling at a guy.

222
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:46,754
When we asked him,
he had no ID.

223
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,754
The guy had a beard and looked suspicious,
sir.

224
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,920
He wouldn't look me in the eye, sir.

225
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:55,212
So, I put him in my jeep. Will question
and release him in the morning, sir.

226
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,962
Is he handcuffed?
-Yes, sir.

227
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:11,004
900 kilos?

228
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,045
How much is it worth in the market?
-Sir...

229
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,712
Approximately 840 crores.

230
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:18,504
Any information about that gang?

231
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:21,170
Adaikalam
and his so-called brother Anbu, sir.

232
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,795
Under them, there are two more guys:
Tips and Ram.

233
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,379
No one in this entire gang
knows what Adaikalam looks like.

234
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:30,920
The master plan of picking a low-key city
like this, turning it into a hub...

235
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:34,587
...and flooding the society with drugs,
is all Adaikalam's handiwork.

236
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:38,795
In the last two years alone, eleven cops
who worked on this case, were killed.

237
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,587
We know these guys did it.
Yet, we can't do anything.

238
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:45,795
What to do, sir? There are many
in our department who work for them.

239
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,504
They are extremely dangerous, sir.

240
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:50,609
We've seized not just drugs,
but a lot of explosives, too!

241
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,962
You won't believe, sir.
They even had a gattling gun!

242
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:58,587
Just that the seven guys who were caught
were low level thugs from the gang, sir.

243
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:02,071
They handle transportation, supply
and such. They know nothing, sir.

244
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:08,420
Let's go.
-That's Rohypnol. A high sedative.

245
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:10,920
Don't mix more than five milliliters
in any bottle.

246
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:14,254
Once consumed, it takes fifteen minutes
to take effect.

247
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,314
But one can regain consciousness
only after eight hours!

248
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:19,795
Who's the informant?

249
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,533
My boy, sir.
Ajaz Ahmed.

250
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,379
Tell him to be careful!

251
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:26,129
No one knows where the drugs are, right?

252
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:28,254
Just you, me and my boys.

253
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,337
Is the Commissioner's office a safe spot?
-No place in the city is safer, sir.

254
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:42,379
As the office is an old British building,
there's a secret basement below, sir.

255
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:47,004
Until we have it on record,
the evidence we seized will be held there.

256
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:51,962
In fact, no one in law and order
even knows that such a place exists, sir!

257
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:53,650
It's completely safe, sir.

258
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:57,931
Step out.
Go have a drink, guys!

259
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,045
Hey! Their training is almost over.
Just one day, right? Let them go.

260
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:07,337
Sir!

261
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:13,004
I'll say it again. Don't put more than
five milliliters in any bottle.

262
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:16,876
Even if it's up by one point,
it can cause death by overdose. Watch it.

263
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:24,962
This is a major case.

264
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,884
Can't pull off a consignment this big,
without political involvement.

265
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,087
For some political reasons...

266
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:36,004
...it won't be surprising
if we have to give these back.

267
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,196
Sir?

268
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:38,959
Tell your boys to be safe.

269
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:41,129
Nothing about this
must leak out.

270
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:45,379
You know what would happen
if all these drugs reach society, sir...

271
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,837
Hey!
I was speaking hypothetically.

272
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:50,337
It is a possibility.
Try to understand.

273
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:52,129
Come gulp down two large shots.

274
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:54,170
No, sir.
I'm under medication.

275
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:56,610
Alright!
At least give me company!

276
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:07,754
Sir!

277
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:10,462
What's up?
Everyone's here, right?

278
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,087
I retire in a month.

279
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:16,379
Think they'll get that damn Nagaraj
as my replacement.

280
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:18,254
Tiruchy's about to witness a new dawn!

281
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,212
Couldn't hang out with you
at my son's wedding.

282
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:32,879
Plenty of protests that time, too.
You guys were busy with it, as well.

283
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:35,504
This small party is to celebrate
both these events.

284
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:40,712
Also, I've recommended eleven people
for promotion.

285
00:17:40,837 --> 00:17:41,837
It will come soon.

286
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:45,754
Don't just stand there! Get started!
Enough with the formalities!

287
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,670
Be sure to inform the station!

288
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:56,016
The names of five cops
are in this paper!

289
00:17:56,712 --> 00:17:58,379
The one who brings me
their heads...

290
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,087
...gets a settlement
of a lifetime!

291
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:05,254
All those bloody cops
are at the Inspector General's guest house!

292
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:06,920
Their deaths will make...

293
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,504
...any cop who even thinks
of messing with us...

294
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:10,712
...shiver in fear!

295
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:13,045
This is an open challenge!
Take it on if you dare!

296
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:41,129
Cheers!

297
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:46,254
Don't be shy! Just have it.
-No thanks.

298
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:56,004
Cheers!

299
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,420
Cheers!

300
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,045
Excuse me.

301
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,129
All going perfectly, sir!
They've started drinking.

302
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
I'll call back, sir.

303
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:28,254
Confirmed that this is where
the stuff is?

304
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,087
Take half of our guys
and get going.

305
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:35,657
I'll clear out the rest of the stuff...

306
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:38,879
...and track down the place
where the boss is.

307
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:41,633
We can reclaim the cargo
before he gets back.

308
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:47,754
Let's go.

309
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:55,712
Anbu!

310
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:58,670
The guys are ready!
You didn't tell us where the stuff is.

311
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:35,295
Sir!

312
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:39,545
What happened, Joseph?
-Sir!

313
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,254
Sir...
-Move aside!

314
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:48,087
Don't do it, sir!
-Hold him off, sir!

315
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:50,562
What happened?
-Look there!

316
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:52,295
Someone's driving away
in the jeep, sir!

317
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,129
Stop!

318
00:20:57,754 --> 00:20:59,415
Look up, sir!
-Are you okay?

319
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:04,515
Somebody catch him!

320
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:11,205
Sir!

321
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:13,337
Sir!

322
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:14,504
What?
-Come look, sir!

323
00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:16,379
Where's the I.G.?
-He passed out, sir!

324
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:18,185
Sir...Sir..

325
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:23,004
What happened, sir?

326
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:26,045
You're bleeding! They drugged
our drinks or our water, sir!

327
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,337
Commissioner's office is under attack!
It's a trap! What do we do, sir?

328
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:31,504
Folks from law and order, and crime
are here, yes?

329
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:34,462
Shall I inform the railway police
and CB-CID, sir?

330
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:37,670
Don't!
Let no one know about this.

331
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:42,504
We can lose the drugs.
But not a single cop must lose his life!

332
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:46,379
If the media finds out,
it'll embarrass the entire department!

333
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:47,920
Do something!

334
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:50,962
I wanted to retire with dignity.

335
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:53,004
I must have that!
Please do something!

336
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:55,337
Please!
-Is any one out there?

337
00:21:56,004 --> 00:21:57,004
Hey!

338
00:21:58,212 --> 00:22:00,837
No one eat or drink anything!
Throw away everything!

339
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:02,837
Alright, sir!
-What do we do with them?

340
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
Hold on.

341
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,879
Patience.
Be careful!

342
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,170
Hold on!

343
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:15,795
Hey, Kamatchi!

344
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,712
Whose truck is this?
-Our truck, sir.

345
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,587
Catering truck.
-Where's the driver?

346
00:22:19,712 --> 00:22:23,129
As he only had to drive tomorrow,
he boozed and ended up like these guys!

347
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:24,962
Do you drive?
-Can't drive a truck, sir!

348
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:26,879
You?
-I can only ride two-wheelers.

349
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:29,004
And you?
-I don't know how to drive a truck, sir.

350
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:30,795
Check if there's anyone in the back!

351
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:34,920
What happened to them, sir?
-It doesn't concern you.

352
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:36,545
Just do what you're told. Now go!

353
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,629
No one here either, sir!

354
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:50,670
The guy had a beard and looked suspicious,
sir.

355
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,629
He wouldn't look me in the eye, sir.

356
00:22:53,754 --> 00:22:56,920
So, I put him in my jeep. Will question
and release him in the morning, sir.

357
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:08,087
Hey!
Do you know how to drive?

358
00:23:09,212 --> 00:23:10,295
Hey! I'm talking to you!

359
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,170
Can you drive a truck?

360
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:14,587
Are you deaf?

361
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:16,587
Hey!
Do you hear me or not?

362
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:21,110
Hey!
Do you know to drive or not?

363
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:24,732
Okay...

364
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Step out.

365
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,295
Go start that truck up!

366
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,962
The Commissioner's office
is 80 kilometers away.

367
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:13,337
Drop me there and take off.

368
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:16,564
I'll see to it there's no case
against you. Go it? Go!

369
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:20,545
What?

370
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,712
Can't do it.

371
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,712
You said you knew how to drive.

372
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,837
I did say that.

373
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:27,462
Never said I would do it.

374
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:30,795
What the hell, man? You raise your voice
after I took off your cuffs?

375
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,337
How could I not, sir?

376
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:33,837
Is it a crime
to have a beard?

377
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:36,504
Your guy roughly pulled
at my brand new shirt!

378
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:38,045
It got torn, too!

379
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:42,795
If someone from the government says so,
your guy said he'd let me go.

380
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:45,268
Here. Talk to her.

381
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:47,044
Hello!

382
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:48,879
Hey Dilli!
Got into the bus?

383
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:51,004
I'm not Dilli.
I'm Bejoy.

384
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:52,587
Special Task Force.

385
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:53,712
Who's he to you?

386
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:57,127
I'm Nalini.
Probation officer. Puzhal Jail.

387
00:24:58,545 --> 00:25:00,587
Is he a convict?
-He was.

388
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:01,751
Not anymore.

389
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:04,004
He was serving a life sentence.

390
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:06,170
Four years were cut off
by remission.

391
00:25:06,295 --> 00:25:09,462
He served ten years in prison
and was just released today.

392
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:12,319
He has a release order with him.
Didn't you see it?

393
00:25:12,437 --> 00:25:15,379
Convicts shouldn't have beards.
How is this, ma'am?

394
00:25:15,504 --> 00:25:17,670
Special petition, sir.
For a pilgrimage!

395
00:25:17,795 --> 00:25:19,587
First tell me your problem!

396
00:25:19,712 --> 00:25:21,379
An emergency here, ma'am!

397
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:24,212
A truck must be driven for 80 kilometers.
No one else here.

398
00:25:24,337 --> 00:25:27,879
I asked him to drive and he refuses.
You're a G.O., right? Tell him!

399
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:30,629
Why must Dilli drive the truck?
He won't do it!

400
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:32,004
Let him go!

401
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:34,688
Please listen to me, ma'am...
-Sir!

402
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:37,379
Listen carefully to what I say.

403
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:40,170
He hasn't seen his child in ten years.

404
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:46,754
After so long, we just got to know
that she's at an ashram in Perambalur.

405
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,423
Tomorrow morning, he's going to meet
his daughter for the first time.

406
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:53,587
Why do you drag him
into your mess, sir?

407
00:25:53,712 --> 00:25:54,879
Ma'am...

408
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:57,087
Every convict has a justification.

409
00:25:57,212 --> 00:25:58,962
But this is a serious situation!

410
00:25:59,087 --> 00:26:00,879
Involves the lives of many cops!

411
00:26:01,004 --> 00:26:02,665
Please tell him to drive!

412
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,670
Talk to her.

413
00:26:08,545 --> 00:26:09,879
Hello?
-Dilli...

414
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,844
Listen to what that cop wants and help...
-Ma'am...

415
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:15,798
I can't do it, ma'am.

416
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:18,985
The life I lost
has just begun again.

417
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:21,879
Please don't compel me, ma'am.

418
00:26:23,837 --> 00:26:26,509
I'll call you after I get on the bus.
-No, Dilli...

419
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,545
I'll ask you for the last time.

420
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,129
Will you drive or not?

421
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:34,420
Un-cuff me, sir.
I must get going.

422
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:37,087
I'm screaming my head off!

423
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,045
It's that release order in your pocket,
right? Look here!

424
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,384
Get charged with even a petty crime
in the next 3 years, it'll be nixed!

425
00:26:43,493 --> 00:26:45,170
You'll be sent back to jail!
Know it, right?

426
00:26:46,837 --> 00:26:48,295
I know where your child is.

427
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,670
One phone call's enough.

428
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:52,795
I can have her transferred to another home
overnight!

429
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,504
It'll take you ten years to even find out
where she is! Shall I do it?

430
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:58,087
Or will you start the truck?

431
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,587
Thought you'd let me go
if I told the truth.

432
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:06,004
You had to play the cop game!
-Why not?

433
00:27:06,129 --> 00:27:09,754
Like only you have a family!
Do you only consider yourself to be human?

434
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,379
Don't cops have families, too?

435
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,629
This is night!
Cops aren't on the beat tonight!

436
00:27:13,754 --> 00:27:16,920
Read in tomorrow's paper of the crimes
that go down tonight! You'll get it!

437
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:19,009
Cops on duty
were drinking.

438
00:27:20,212 --> 00:27:23,170
Will the news also report that a convict
dropped them at the precinct?

439
00:27:23,297 --> 00:27:25,321
Do you want to see your daughter or not?

440
00:27:38,193 --> 00:27:41,985
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

441
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:46,024
Sister?
-What is it?

442
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:49,930
How many more hours left
until ten o'clock in the morning?

443
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:53,110
First, put away the clock
and go to sleep.

444
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:55,681
If Ma'am comes for rounds,
you'll get in trouble!

445
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:39,193
Hey! Do you know how to drive a truck
or not?

446
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,068
Oh God!

447
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:04,474
What's wrong?
-Sir...

448
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:06,776
It doesn't brake properly.

449
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:09,818
All four wheels are shaking.
Third gear isn't working right.

450
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:12,458
Don't know if it can go 80 kilometers, sir.
-Sir!...

451
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,610
I swear to God the truck just got insured
and was issued a safety certificate!

452
00:29:15,735 --> 00:29:18,401
This guy doesn't know how to drive!
It's in great shape, sir!

453
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:20,485
Do we drive around
without knowing all this?

454
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,901
Go ask what's up!
-Who are you?

455
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,974
Look at the board.
I'm the Kamatchi mentioned there!

456
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:26,681
I own this truck!
-Fine!

457
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:29,629
Don't do anything unless I say so.
Go stand there!

458
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:33,060
Carefully carry each officer
into the truck.

459
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:37,312
Listen up. No matter what,
don't tell anyone what happened here.

460
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:41,020
If you do, I'll arrest you
and your entire family!

461
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:42,831
Alright.
-Go help with this.

462
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:48,488
Let's go!

463
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:49,594
Go inside!

464
00:29:52,232 --> 00:29:54,240
Lift them up slowly.

465
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:06,478
Come along!
All convicts stand in line!

466
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,436
Stand in line, I say!

467
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,834
What kind of reaction did they have,
Bejoy?

468
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:36,376
Both pulse and heartbeat
are elevated, doctor.

469
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,334
Some of them even vomitted blood.

470
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:40,917
Bleeding from the ears, too.
I'm a little scared.

471
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:42,251
Alright, listen.

472
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:44,209
You're aware of sedative drugs, right?

473
00:30:44,816 --> 00:30:48,941
Brotizolam, Midazolum,
Ketamine and Rohypnol.

474
00:30:49,403 --> 00:30:53,068
If any of these is mixed with alcohol,
there'd be this type of reaction.

475
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:57,602
If treated within five hours,
they can be saved, Bejoy.

476
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,856
If not, it'll be very difficult.

477
00:31:00,981 --> 00:31:02,856
There are chances of cardiac arrest.

478
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:05,231
I can't come by the highway.

479
00:31:05,356 --> 00:31:07,314
And no one must know about this incident.

480
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,023
It's a bit complicated to explain.

481
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:12,314
Send me the location. I'll get there soon.
-Hurry.

482
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:17,396
Vignesh! Keep my bag inside
and see how many beds are available.

483
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:18,698
We may need extra beds.

484
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:21,364
Hold the legs! Uncle

485
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:25,323
That's it. Just let them lie.
-Go!

486
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:49,147
Place them like that and it won't hold!
Lay them down! Come, uncle!

487
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:51,772
Just a minute, sir!

488
00:31:51,897 --> 00:31:53,605
How do I turn this crap off?

489
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,605
Press the first button!

490
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,050
Not the second. The first!
That's it!

491
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,527
Hello! Tell me, sir.

492
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:03,273
Muthu! How many of you are on duty
at the Commissioner's office?

493
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,659
Me and three other constables
on night duty.

494
00:32:05,732 --> 00:32:06,774
And in the office?

495
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:08,776
Everyone in the office has left!

496
00:32:08,922 --> 00:32:11,922
Besides the convicts in lock-up,
is there anyone else there?

497
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:14,588
Four students
on a drunken diving charge, sir.

498
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:16,297
Alert the other stations.

499
00:32:16,422 --> 00:32:18,880
Bring all constables to where you're at.
I'm on my way!

500
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,880
Listen carefully.

501
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:24,130
Have the constables
shut every door in our station. Got it?

502
00:32:24,255 --> 00:32:26,880
I understand.
But why are we doing this, sir?

503
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:29,797
Stop asking questions
and do what I say. Quick!

504
00:32:29,922 --> 00:32:31,130
Alert everyone, alright?

505
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,755
Hoist them in!

506
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,963
I said 'hoist', not 'drop'!

507
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:43,963
My arm got stuck!

508
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:46,630
Hold this!
-Quit talking! Now lift! Hurry!

509
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:49,255
Lift them up!

510
00:32:50,255 --> 00:32:51,838
Samayapuram police station?

511
00:32:51,963 --> 00:32:54,130
I'm calling from
the Commissioner's office.

512
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:56,005
Inspector there?
-Mr. Murali there?

513
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,797
He's not here.
-S.I. there?

514
00:32:57,922 --> 00:33:00,213
He left a while back.
-No officials at the station.

515
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:02,297
Give me his mobile number.
-98...

516
00:33:02,422 --> 00:33:03,963
He's not reachable on his cell.

517
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:06,922
Got a message saying 'I.G. Guesthouse'.
-Is that what he said?

518
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:08,422
Don't know anything else.

519
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:12,255
How many of you are there?
-Just me and another police constable.

520
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,797
If he comes, tell him to call back.
-Will do.

521
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:17,297
Ask them why they're hauling
so many people, uncle!

522
00:33:17,422 --> 00:33:18,668
You just keep loading them in!

523
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:21,213
Poor chaps!
-Will you carry vessels on your head?

524
00:33:21,338 --> 00:33:22,914
At least you tell him, aunty!

525
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,047
Do whatever you want!
-Listen. Now, we're here.

526
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:28,338
This is where we must go.
About 80 kilometers.

527
00:33:28,463 --> 00:33:30,088
Can't take the Poondi Highway.

528
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:33,626
Take a shortcut to Thavakudi
and drop them off at the hospital.

529
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:35,880
Then, to the Commissioner's office.
-Know the route?

530
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:38,016
Tell me as we go along.
-We need the map.

531
00:33:39,088 --> 00:33:41,297
All done!
-Any locals here?

532
00:33:41,422 --> 00:33:43,047
Any other route
to Pazhani?

533
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:46,380
There's no route I don't know.
Even Google Maps doesn't know them!

534
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:49,583
There's a roundabout shortcut. That fine?
-Know the route?

535
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:52,197
From Madhavaram into Devancheri,
Ayampettai, Thittakudi...

536
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,231
Can a truck go through?
-"Can it go through"?

537
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:56,564
Only my truck goes there!
Two checkposts en route.

538
00:33:56,689 --> 00:33:58,356
If you pay off your guys there...

539
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,147
They'll let us through.

540
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,622
Bring him, too.
-What?

541
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:03,189
Can't drive without directions.

542
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:05,939
Hey! Get inside the truck.
-Sir?

543
00:34:06,064 --> 00:34:07,189
Come!
-What the hell, sir?

544
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:08,314
Come!
-Why must I?

545
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:09,689
Look at this, uncle!

546
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,689
You hauled these guys
without my consent!

547
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:15,814
If you coolly take my truck,
how do we all go home with our stuff?

548
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:17,397
Pay me first, sir!
-Hey!

549
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,064
Think I'm asking for permission?

550
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:21,891
40 cops are unconscious!
What did you put in the food?

551
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,476
I'll arrest you both!

552
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:24,893
You can't do business!

553
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:26,435
Now get in!
-No, sir...

554
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:33,810
That guy casually had ton of biryani
and sits hale and hearty in there, sir!

555
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:35,810
How come he alone is fine?

556
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:38,630
Do you know how famous Kamatchi Biryani
is in Tiruchy, sir?

557
00:34:40,571 --> 00:34:43,661
Yes, dear. Only if you go,
will our truck be safe.

558
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:44,868
Get lost!

559
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,321
Let's go.

560
00:35:05,446 --> 00:35:09,071
I called every station.
They told us exactly what they told you!

561
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:11,612
No officials in any station.
Just constables.

562
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,154
We'll shut all the doors, sir.

563
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,487
Four of us are here.
We'll manage, sir!

564
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:20,987
And if we shut the doors?
Don't know how many of them are coming.

565
00:35:21,112 --> 00:35:23,196
How many people can we fight
with just batons?

566
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,571
Sir...

567
00:35:24,696 --> 00:35:27,487
They asked only us to handle it.
That's why I'm worried.

568
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:29,362
So we're the sacrificial lambs?

569
00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:31,237
I got only five more months of work left.

570
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,029
Don't want to get banged up
and be crippled in my last days!

571
00:35:34,154 --> 00:35:37,237
That's not it. If there's an inquiry,
we'll be the ones questioned.

572
00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:40,029
Who said so?
They'll start from the higher-ups.

573
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:41,954
Let them deal with it!

574
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:43,987
Have you all forgotten?

575
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:47,821
When three cops at the Kajarpet station
died during night duty...

576
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:50,446
...no higher officials answered the phone
then, too!

577
00:35:50,571 --> 00:35:52,779
Let's focus on leaving here alive.

578
00:35:52,904 --> 00:35:54,696
Whatever it is, let the night pass.

579
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,279
That girl and four boys
are in there, sir.

580
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:59,029
Shall we let them go?

581
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:02,987
Hey! If you go say something,
you might be busted in the inquiry!

582
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:05,154
What is fated to happen will happen.
Come!

583
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:29,946
Take this left.

584
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:33,636
No, wait!
The next left!

585
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:46,430
No... think it was the previous left.

586
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:51,196
Hey, kiddo...

587
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:54,154
Do you hink this is a moped
where one can turn as they please?

588
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,654
Can't you direct me properly?
-I can only tell like this!

589
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:58,237
Take it or find the way yourself!

590
00:36:58,362 --> 00:36:59,946
He's scolding me, sir!

591
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:01,987
This'll confuse me
and I'll forget the route!

592
00:37:02,112 --> 00:37:03,946
Like you pay me for this!

593
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:05,987
Threaten me
as if you pay my salary!

594
00:37:06,112 --> 00:37:08,404
I pay salaries to many people
every month, you know!

595
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,226
Tell him to drive quietly, sir!

596
00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:31,793
Pandi?
-Sir?

597
00:37:31,818 --> 00:37:33,946
If our guys get there,
point those men out.

598
00:37:34,071 --> 00:37:35,154
They'll handle...
-No!

599
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:39,112
Some random guy picked up all the cops
and is driving them somewhere in a truck!

600
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:40,571
Going where?
-I don't know!

601
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:43,071
You were there, sir?
Couldn't you do anything?

602
00:37:43,196 --> 00:37:45,362
I can't do anything, sir!
Bejoy's here, too!

603
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:46,487
Okay, hang up.

604
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:48,696
I'll call in five minutes
and tell you what to do.

605
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:49,821
Alright, sir.

606
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:58,487
Hold on.

607
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,034
No one's around, buddy.
That phone's been ringing for a while.

608
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:11,633
They've all left.

609
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:16,592
Shall we all just escape, bro?

610
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:18,217
Hey!
-Just sit quietly!

611
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:20,800
Buzz off!
Incessantly bothering me...

612
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,300
Hey!
-Tell me!

613
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,634
Where are you going?

614
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,009
Tell him to be quiet, Chittu!

615
00:38:25,134 --> 00:38:27,300
They took us along, Tamizh!
-Be silent!

616
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:29,275
Why drink again?
-Shall we booze?

617
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,509
The Inspector'll come soon...
-Quiet!

618
00:38:31,634 --> 00:38:32,759
Don't make trouble!

619
00:38:32,884 --> 00:38:35,079
Blue shirt!
Do you hear me?

620
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:37,173
No cops around?

621
00:38:38,594 --> 00:38:40,634
Yes, there's no one here.

622
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:42,938
Just come up for a minute!

623
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:44,967
I won't do anything.

624
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:48,175
There's a key over here.
Just get it to us.

625
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,842
Don't go!
-Come!

626
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:51,384
Don't go there!
-Please help!

627
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:52,967
Don't be scared!
-Hey!

628
00:38:53,092 --> 00:38:55,550
Just get it to us.
-Don't go!

629
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:57,217
Come!
-Where are you going?

630
00:38:57,342 --> 00:38:58,884
That guy called me from up there.

631
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:01,259
You should not go near suspects!
Come!

632
00:39:01,384 --> 00:39:02,842
Where are the other cops?

633
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,842
We don't know anything.
They left.

634
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,384
No one's been here for a while.

635
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:08,467
How can they leave
during duty hours?

636
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:10,175
Move aside.

637
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,717
Why are you people here?

638
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:17,550
We're engineering students...
-Stop!

639
00:39:17,675 --> 00:39:19,342
We got busted for drunken driving.

640
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:22,162
The Inspector has our licenses,
cell phones and college IDs.

641
00:39:22,217 --> 00:39:24,154
We can't leave until he returns.
-Move.

642
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,800
Hello?
-Alerted the other stations, Muthu?

643
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:35,634
Who is this?
-Bejoy speaking! Special Task Force!

644
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:37,009
Sir!

645
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:38,550
There's no one at the station!

646
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:40,592
Head constable was there,
but even he left!

647
00:39:40,717 --> 00:39:42,675
There are no cops around?
What the hell...

648
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,050
Who are you?
-I'm Napoleon, sir!

649
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,717
I got transferred here from Tirunelveli.
Haven't joined duty here yet!

650
00:39:49,842 --> 00:39:51,134
How old are you?

651
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:53,384
I turn 55
in the coming 'Puratasi' month!

652
00:39:53,509 --> 00:39:55,092
Alright, then.

653
00:39:55,217 --> 00:39:57,050
Your service has commenced.
Got it?

654
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:58,550
I don't get it!

655
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:02,634
From now on, your posting
is at the Commissioner's office!

656
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:03,962
Got it?
-Yes, sir!

657
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,217
There's an emergency. On my way there now!
I'll reach in two hours!

658
00:40:07,342 --> 00:40:10,009
Until then,
no one gets into the Commissioner's office!

659
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:11,925
Lock all the doors and windows!
-Got it!

660
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:14,592
Shut all the gates right away! Hurry!
-Yes, sir!

661
00:40:43,884 --> 00:40:46,759
Eyes on the road. Next right turn.
I'm not sure about that, too.

662
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:58,384
Mustn't I give directions all night?
Tonight, what I say is the route. Go!

663
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:01,342
Hey!

664
00:41:02,217 --> 00:41:04,550
Know what that man will do to you...

665
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:07,675
...if I say I'm feeling giddy
after eating the biryani you made?

666
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,300
Will you tell the route properly, now?
-Yes, bro.

667
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:17,884
This right.
Correct route.

668
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,509
Who do I speak to?

669
00:41:24,634 --> 00:41:26,842
I'll give you the number
of a guy named Tips.

670
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:29,584
Tell him the route.
-I'll call him right away!

671
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:37,050
Cleared the stuff from the upper level!
-Have them clear out soon!

672
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:39,759
Hello?
-Tips?

673
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:41,967
I'm the guy Mr. Stephen told you about.
-Go on.

674
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:45,384
The truck's going by Madhavaram.
Don't know where it's headed.

675
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:47,800
They're taking a right
into Devancheri!

676
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:49,509
Keep giving me the directions.

677
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:51,675
I'll handle it.
-Will do!

678
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,342
Hey!
The truck is not at the I.G.'s guesthouse.

679
00:41:55,467 --> 00:41:58,175
They're carrying all of them
and going via Madhavaram.

680
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,175
They'll have to cross the hill.

681
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,967
Split up into teams and go.

682
00:42:02,092 --> 00:42:04,550
If they escape from any one of you,
the other will get them!

683
00:42:19,092 --> 00:42:22,050
He's not even a cop, bro!
I think he's just a watchman!

684
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,259
Sir!
-What happened, Napoleon?

685
00:42:29,384 --> 00:42:31,217
All the doors are shut, sir!

686
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:34,884
Including the main door.
But they need reinforcement from inside!

687
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:36,509
Then do it!
I'm on my way there!

688
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:37,967
Can't do it on my own, sir.

689
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:40,925
Sir!
Why did you lock all the doors, sir?

690
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,550
First, let us go!
-Wait!

691
00:42:42,675 --> 00:42:45,592
Who's that?
-The girl who came with the college kids.

692
00:42:45,717 --> 00:42:47,675
Shall I let them go?
-Don't do that.

693
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,634
No one leaves until I get there.
Take all their phones.

694
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:52,300
Alright, sir.
Give me that phone.

695
00:42:52,425 --> 00:42:55,509
Why, sir?
-I'll return it soon! Just give it.

696
00:42:56,884 --> 00:42:59,675
Have those kids help you lock up. Hurry!
-Yes, sir!

697
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,384
Each of you give me a hand.

698
00:43:01,509 --> 00:43:03,800
Use these benches and chairs
to block the doors!

699
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:06,384
Come along!
-Why should we do all this, sir?

700
00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:08,701
You took our phones
and won't let us go!

701
00:43:08,726 --> 00:43:11,592
Return it! I need to call the Inspector!
-Hold on! I'll return it!

702
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:13,884
We can only help
if you tell us what's going on!

703
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:16,467
I myself don't know!
Let the higher official arrive!

704
00:43:16,592 --> 00:43:17,592
He'll explain!

705
00:43:17,717 --> 00:43:21,240
We'll help out. Just don't charge
any of us for drunken driving!

706
00:43:21,342 --> 00:43:22,717
What?
-I'll handle it.

707
00:43:22,842 --> 00:43:25,009
Forget that, sir!
They drunk and drove.

708
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:26,842
I just accompanied them!
-Is that so?

709
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:29,092
Sir! Don't charge us...
-Shut up!

710
00:43:29,217 --> 00:43:30,550
I'll give you an earful!

711
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:33,009
He's struggling so much by himself!
Got no sense?

712
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:36,342
I'll stay until the other cops come!
Leave if you wish!

713
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:38,175
I'll come help, sir!
-Come along!

714
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,557
Give me a hand with that bench.

715
00:43:42,134 --> 00:43:43,342
Push harder!

716
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:47,168
Come!

717
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:50,134
Keep pushing!

718
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,467
Crossing Vannadu!
Yes!

719
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:08,384
Confirmed?
-Indeed!

720
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:10,050
Moongilthottam!
I saw the board!

721
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:14,884
The guys are coming.
Just point out those five cops!

722
00:44:14,977 --> 00:44:16,821
Alright.
-They'll handle the rest.

723
00:44:27,092 --> 00:44:28,134
Help lift this!

724
00:44:34,425 --> 00:44:36,050
There's a door there.
-Yes, sir.

725
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:37,717
Over there!

726
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:41,759
Haul it in!
-Lift it carefully!

727
00:44:41,884 --> 00:44:43,550
Hey!
-What is it?

728
00:44:43,675 --> 00:44:45,384
The booze, you idiot!
-Alright, jerk!

729
00:44:45,509 --> 00:44:46,509
Go!

730
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:12,425
All ready over there?

731
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:15,259
Yes, Tips.
-The truck's on the way.

732
00:45:15,384 --> 00:45:18,467
Hack up those five right there
and bring me their heads!

733
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,384
Got it?
-I'll call you once it's done.

734
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:25,425
Hey!

735
00:45:26,425 --> 00:45:29,891
What is that noise?
-Is this the time to play with the alarm?

736
00:45:30,884 --> 00:45:33,384
Turn it off, Amudha!
-That damn thing keeps making noise!

737
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:34,967
What do you want now?

738
00:45:35,092 --> 00:45:37,259
Want to know who's visiting you
in the morning?

739
00:45:38,884 --> 00:45:39,884
The number register.

740
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:46,967
Radio's down, too. How do we go
so far without listening to music?

741
00:45:47,884 --> 00:45:49,842
Do you have a phone, bro?

742
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:52,009
How would you have one?

743
00:45:52,134 --> 00:45:54,759
Just got released today, right?
Like a new movie!

744
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:56,467
How many years were you in jail?

745
00:45:57,842 --> 00:45:59,300
Ten years.
-Wow!

746
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,759
2009!

747
00:46:02,884 --> 00:46:04,717
I was in eighth grade back then!

748
00:46:04,842 --> 00:46:07,175
Since you went to prison,
quite a lot has changed!

749
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,300
They said they'll change the nation.
But no major changes yet.

750
00:46:10,425 --> 00:46:12,675
We only voted once,
but...

751
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,967
If you're not on WhatsApp,
you're not alive!

752
00:46:15,092 --> 00:46:17,384
Ajith and Rajnikanth's films
released on the same day!

753
00:46:17,509 --> 00:46:20,050
Nowadays,
films run only if they have a good story!

754
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,009
Hell, now we save the cops
who've been saving us so far!

755
00:46:25,134 --> 00:46:26,884
Many such things have changed!

756
00:46:27,009 --> 00:46:30,978
Poor guy!
Seem like a fish out of water, right?

757
00:46:31,345 --> 00:46:33,842
Keep going.
You'll prefer prison to this!

758
00:46:36,592 --> 00:46:37,842
Hey!

759
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:39,717
You think prison is in the planet Mars?

760
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:42,592
Only a wall separates us!

761
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,425
There's a folder with Yesudas songs
in it. Play them.

762
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:48,467
Figured when I saw the ash
on your forehead!

763
00:46:49,634 --> 00:46:52,675
Used whatever was available
and blocked all the doors, sir!

764
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,550
No one can break in easily!

765
00:46:54,675 --> 00:46:57,092
Unlike what you said,
no one's come about, sir.

766
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:58,925
Alright.
Listen up.

767
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,467
Turn off all the lights.
-Okay.

768
00:47:00,592 --> 00:47:01,967
I'm on my way.
-Yes, sir.

769
00:47:02,092 --> 00:47:04,592
Don't be scared, alright?
-Yes, sir. Please come!

770
00:47:06,675 --> 00:47:08,888
Hurry up!
-Sir!

771
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,717
No diesel left.
Don't know when the vehicle will stop.

772
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:14,300
I'll tell you.
Now drive!

773
00:47:14,425 --> 00:47:16,134
How will the vehicle go
if you say so?

774
00:47:16,259 --> 00:47:17,842
(A Yesudas song plays on the phone)

775
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,259
My dad took care of the catering company.

776
00:47:39,384 --> 00:47:42,675
After he died,
I run the business along with my uncle.

777
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,592
Others use sub-standard rice
for biryani.

778
00:47:45,717 --> 00:47:48,550
We use the best kind!
Our brand stands for quality!

779
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:50,800
How was the biryani?

780
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:53,009
Right! You would've had slop
for years!

781
00:47:53,134 --> 00:47:55,509
Even plain rice would seem like biryani
to you, yes?

782
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,550
A call's coming in for you!

783
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:03,092
I have no one to call me.

784
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:07,467
No one's picking up.

785
00:48:07,592 --> 00:48:09,092
Try calling again.

786
00:48:09,217 --> 00:48:11,750
Do it quickly. Ma'am might come!
I'll be in trouble!

787
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,425
Just once more, sir!
-Okay, do it.

788
00:48:27,134 --> 00:48:29,592
Another call from the same number,
bro!

789
00:48:37,884 --> 00:48:39,259
Hello?
-Hello?

790
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:40,717
This is Amudha speaking.

791
00:48:42,092 --> 00:48:43,925
Are you coming to visit me tomorrow?

792
00:48:45,337 --> 00:48:46,618
How are we related?

793
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:33,631
Damn it!
He got away!

794
00:49:35,259 --> 00:49:36,259
Faster!

795
00:49:36,384 --> 00:49:37,800
Stop for nothing!
Drive fast!

796
00:49:38,766 --> 00:49:41,415
Hello?
Hello?

797
00:49:44,188 --> 00:49:45,842
He must not cross Tittivanam!

798
00:49:45,905 --> 00:49:47,134
Is the stuff inside?
-Yes!

799
00:49:47,259 --> 00:49:48,800
He mustn't cross the forest!
-Hurry!

800
00:49:48,925 --> 00:49:50,342
Go! Go! Go!

801
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,342
Can you hear me?
Hello?

802
00:50:14,884 --> 00:50:17,092
Two vehicles are behind us! Drive faster!
-Sir!

803
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:19,092
Who are these guys?
What's going on?

804
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:20,967
Stop asking questions
and drive fast!

805
00:50:21,092 --> 00:50:22,675
The vehicle can only go this fast!

806
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:24,675
Get closer!

807
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,967
Go left!
-Get closer!

808
00:50:27,842 --> 00:50:28,842
Drive faster!

809
00:50:32,259 --> 00:50:33,967
He's not saying anything.

810
00:50:34,555 --> 00:50:36,050
Alright, give it to me.

811
00:50:39,384 --> 00:50:41,134
All the glass is shattered, sir!

812
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:43,134
How do I explain this back home?

813
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:46,175
Keep going!
Take a right!

814
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:54,300
Don't let them overtake you! Go right!
-He's going!

815
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,217
Take the rod
and break open that lock!

816
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:02,092
I'll handle it!
Get the rod!

817
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,425
Don't step on it like it's dung!
Faster!

818
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,717
They're close!
Drive faster!

819
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:18,092
Step on it!
-Break the lock!

820
00:51:18,217 --> 00:51:20,634
They're overtaking us!
Take a left!

821
00:51:27,842 --> 00:51:29,050
Get even closer!

822
00:51:29,175 --> 00:51:31,717
Look that side!
-Step on it!

823
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:46,092
They've opened the back door, sir!

824
00:51:49,366 --> 00:51:51,592
Head back!
Looks like the I.G. might fall!

825
00:51:51,717 --> 00:51:54,092
Get him back in! Hurry!
-You go, sir!

826
00:51:54,217 --> 00:51:56,800
Why are you sending a kid? If he gets hurt?
I brought him along!

827
00:51:56,925 --> 00:51:58,734
Look at my hand! How do I go?

828
00:51:58,804 --> 00:52:00,226
You go!
-Sir!

829
00:52:00,297 --> 00:52:01,281
Stay here!

830
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,797
Do you know who that is?
The Inspector General!

831
00:52:04,898 --> 00:52:07,717
Does that make him a big shot?
He's just fated for a short life!

832
00:52:07,742 --> 00:52:09,034
You stay here!
-Listen up!

833
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:12,300
If anything happens to him,
you won't go home alive! Now head back!

834
00:52:13,092 --> 00:52:14,092
Go quickly!

835
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,050
Maintain the same distance!

836
00:52:29,175 --> 00:52:30,842
Attach the hook onto the truck!

837
00:52:30,967 --> 00:52:32,675
Toss out anyone you find!

838
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:41,175
Throw it at them!
-Do it!

839
00:52:43,217 --> 00:52:45,050
Toss it right at the driver!

840
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,175
Faster!

841
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,925
Get me that hook!
-Here!

842
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,384
Get closer!

843
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:57,384
Driver faster!
-Step on it!

844
00:52:57,509 --> 00:52:58,509
Get closer!

845
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,550
Hey! The guys are here!
Come on!

846
00:53:07,675 --> 00:53:09,800
Hurry up!
-Here you go!

847
00:53:09,925 --> 00:53:11,675
Light it up!
Quickly!

848
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,217
Light it up!

849
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,842
Give it to me!
-Come up front!

850
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,092
Toss that petrol bomb!

851
00:53:20,217 --> 00:53:21,467
Give it to me!

852
00:53:28,884 --> 00:53:30,675
Climb on!
Climb on top of it!

853
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:36,134
Throw it at the driver's face!

854
00:53:38,342 --> 00:53:39,884
Give it!
-Toss it at his face!

855
00:53:40,399 --> 00:53:41,940
-Bro!

856
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:09,717
Step on it!
Hurry!

857
00:54:09,842 --> 00:54:11,300
The clutch is broken, jackass!

858
00:54:11,425 --> 00:54:12,759
It can't move any further!

859
00:54:14,342 --> 00:54:15,509
Hold the steering wheel!

860
00:54:26,884 --> 00:54:28,134
Go up front!
I'll handle it!

861
00:54:41,467 --> 00:54:43,134
The fuel's leaking!
Stop it!

862
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:06,675
Jump out!

863
00:55:07,967 --> 00:55:10,509
Get out, guys!

864
00:55:22,307 --> 00:55:23,509
I hear a motorbike, sir.

865
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:00,515
Hello?
-Hello!

866
00:56:01,398 --> 00:56:03,189
A girl spoke to me.

867
00:56:04,476 --> 00:56:06,231
Can I talk to her, sir?

868
00:56:06,356 --> 00:56:07,356
Who are you?

869
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:10,564
I am...

870
00:56:11,603 --> 00:56:12,981
I am her father, sir.

871
00:56:13,106 --> 00:56:16,641
You abandoned her at this ashram
and shamelessly say you're her father?

872
00:56:18,439 --> 00:56:20,148
All my bad luck, sir.

873
00:56:20,273 --> 00:56:22,939
You know how many times
Amudha tried calling you?

874
00:56:23,064 --> 00:56:25,189
You didn't pick up at all.

875
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:28,064
Poor girl walked away,
hanging her head.

876
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:32,064
Cell phone signal was down
as I was going through the forest.

877
00:56:33,231 --> 00:56:36,148
The line got cut off
before I could say a word.

878
00:56:36,273 --> 00:56:38,273
Can you please call that child, sir?

879
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:39,939
It's pretty hard, my man.

880
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:43,023
Think your child
is studying in a convent school?

881
00:56:43,148 --> 00:56:45,648
This is an orphange.

882
00:56:45,714 --> 00:56:49,189
All the 150 girls here
stay in one room.

883
00:56:49,314 --> 00:56:53,731
They're sleeping all over the place
while being bitten by mosquitoes!

884
00:56:54,356 --> 00:56:55,356
I understand, sir.

885
00:56:56,731 --> 00:56:59,564
I've never seen my child's face
since she was born.

886
00:57:01,273 --> 00:57:03,023
I'll pay you when I come in the morning.

887
00:57:03,148 --> 00:57:05,116
What?
You'll pay me?

888
00:57:05,913 --> 00:57:09,564
Expect me to take a bribe to let a father
and child speak for the first time...

889
00:57:09,689 --> 00:57:11,023
...and die in shame for that?

890
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:12,856
I said I can't...

891
00:57:12,981 --> 00:57:16,481
I said I can't go in right now.
Try to understand.

892
00:57:16,606 --> 00:57:17,606
Please forgive me.

893
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:21,731
When I heard my child's voice
for the first time...

894
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,481
...I just got floored.

895
00:57:24,606 --> 00:57:26,490
That's why I spoke that way.
Somehow...

896
00:57:26,606 --> 00:57:29,773
I recall seeing Amudha's photo
on the notice board once.

897
00:57:29,898 --> 00:57:31,273
If it's there,
I'll send it.

898
00:57:31,398 --> 00:57:33,314
Do you have WhatsApp?
-Yes.

899
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,564
Bless you, sir.

900
00:57:34,689 --> 00:57:36,273
First let me check if it's there.

901
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:41,273
If you just go straight,
we'll reach Tittivanam.

902
00:57:41,398 --> 00:57:42,648
Just twelve kilometers.

903
00:57:42,773 --> 00:57:45,564
Hard to travel by this vehicle.
All forest area!

904
00:57:45,689 --> 00:57:47,648
No proper lights or roads.

905
00:57:49,148 --> 00:57:50,356
Start up the vehicle.

906
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:52,731
I can't do it, sir.

907
00:57:54,106 --> 00:57:56,273
You asked me to drop you off
and go about my way.

908
00:57:56,379 --> 00:57:59,356
Who the hell are those guys?
They would've killed us!

909
00:57:59,481 --> 00:58:01,148
I'll explain everything.
Now come!

910
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:02,314
I won't do it, sir!

911
00:58:02,439 --> 00:58:03,523
Tell me what's going on!

912
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,064
You all will booze
and pass out!

913
00:58:06,189 --> 00:58:07,439
Should we suffer for it?

914
00:58:07,564 --> 00:58:09,148
What the hell was that, sir?

915
00:58:09,273 --> 00:58:10,856
Think you cops can do anything?

916
00:58:10,981 --> 00:58:12,606
What about the truck, sir?

917
00:58:12,731 --> 00:58:15,231
Your truck will be restored
to the way it was! Get in!

918
00:58:15,356 --> 00:58:18,189
The truck can be fixed.
What if he had died?

919
00:58:18,314 --> 00:58:20,106
I'm going!
I'll walk the rest of the way!

920
00:58:20,231 --> 00:58:23,189
Find the route yourself!
Inviting me for my own death, huh?

921
00:58:23,314 --> 00:58:26,356
They're not the drunken rogues
that you think they are!

922
00:58:26,481 --> 00:58:29,064
They're cops who've been on the job
for 10-15 years!

923
00:58:29,189 --> 00:58:31,648
They've been intentionally drugged!
Come!

924
00:58:34,773 --> 00:58:37,398
You know what will happen
if they reclaim these drugs?

925
00:58:37,523 --> 00:58:38,523
You won't understand!

926
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,564
Start the truck
if you want to see your child!

927
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,189
Wait!
Did you drink?

928
00:58:48,314 --> 00:58:51,648
Oh, so it's fine for them to drink,
but it's not okay if I do?

929
00:58:51,711 --> 00:58:54,158
Stand before a stove all day!
You'll see how it ache!

930
00:58:58,283 --> 00:58:59,492
They've left, bro.

931
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:12,391
Pull over here, bro!

932
00:59:15,703 --> 00:59:17,062
What is it?
Isn't this the route?

933
00:59:17,297 --> 00:59:19,320
Yes. But don't know if we go left or right.
-Hello

934
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,589
I've sent the photo. See it.
-Alright, sir.

935
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:23,797
Yes, Tips!

936
00:59:23,922 --> 00:59:25,922
Check post number ten!
-Have you crossed it?

937
00:59:26,047 --> 00:59:27,797
No!
We haven't turned back!

938
00:59:29,047 --> 00:59:30,881
Take the left, bro.
We'll handle it.

939
00:59:37,589 --> 00:59:40,006
He turned left
at the check post!

940
01:00:02,508 --> 01:00:03,964
I received a photo.

941
01:00:04,032 --> 01:00:05,860
This thing's just spinning.
Check it.

942
01:00:06,172 --> 01:00:08,756
Ah! If there's the letter 'E',
the image won't download.

943
01:00:08,851 --> 01:00:11,131
If you had 3G or 4G,
there'd be instant download!

944
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:14,422
My phone is with my uncle.
Else, I would've shown it to you.

945
01:00:14,547 --> 01:00:16,422
Shall I ask the cop for internet, bro?

946
01:00:16,547 --> 01:00:18,400
Hey!
It appears no one is inside.

947
01:00:18,425 --> 01:00:20,339
Go stand by the vehicle.
-Okay.

948
01:00:28,908 --> 01:00:30,631
To me, all crows are black, bro!

949
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:32,339
But don't they know their parents?

950
01:00:32,464 --> 01:00:35,297
Just go and watch
how your daughter runs right to you, bro!

951
01:00:35,422 --> 01:00:36,422
What do you say, sir?

952
01:00:36,547 --> 01:00:39,572
Hey! The road's empty, right?
Step on it!

953
01:00:46,922 --> 01:00:50,256
At the rate it's spinning, it'll blow wind
but won't download the photo!

954
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:52,547
This phone is crap!

955
01:00:52,672 --> 01:00:54,964
Heard of Oppo or Vivo phones?

956
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:57,631
That Vivo V5 model?
Should've bought one of those!

957
01:01:02,297 --> 01:01:03,506
Look over there, bro!

958
01:01:05,714 --> 01:01:07,047
Don't stop!
Step on it!

959
01:01:07,172 --> 01:01:08,422
Keep going!

960
01:01:08,547 --> 01:01:09,547
Drive fast!

961
01:01:10,297 --> 01:01:11,922
Faster!
Don't stop!

962
01:01:28,214 --> 01:01:30,131
Reverse!
Back up!

963
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:32,937
Faster!
-Go fast, bro!

964
01:02:12,089 --> 01:02:13,589
A vehicle's coming from behind!

965
01:02:41,172 --> 01:02:43,006
What happened?
-The lights are out.

966
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:45,589
Don't know if it's safe to go in.
What do we do?

967
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:47,506
Go break the door.

968
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:49,881
See if you have a rod.

969
01:02:51,631 --> 01:02:54,547
They've got knives and sticks, bro!
Do something!

970
01:02:54,672 --> 01:02:56,339
See if you can turn the truck around!

971
01:02:56,464 --> 01:02:59,006
All forest area around us, sir!
-Run over them and go!

972
01:02:59,131 --> 01:03:01,047
I can't run them over
and go back to prison.

973
01:03:01,172 --> 01:03:03,256
Just run them down!
I'll handle the fallout!

974
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:07,714
Hey!

975
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,381
I cornered the truck!

976
01:03:09,506 --> 01:03:11,589
Those five heads are mine!

977
01:03:11,714 --> 01:03:13,464
Just go back the way you came!

978
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:14,922
How's that, now?

979
01:03:15,047 --> 01:03:18,631
I set up the bamboo to block the truck
and forced it to change routes!

980
01:03:18,756 --> 01:03:20,797
You'll take the five heads!

981
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,922
Am I a simpleton?

982
01:03:23,047 --> 01:03:26,881
So I can tie the nuptial thread
but you get to enjoy the wedding night?

983
01:03:27,006 --> 01:03:28,006
Why not?

984
01:03:28,131 --> 01:03:30,631
If you come late,
I'd be the one to do it!

985
01:03:30,756 --> 01:03:32,547
I'm the one that trapped them!

986
01:03:32,672 --> 01:03:35,256
You came from the back!
I stand up front!

987
01:03:35,381 --> 01:03:37,547
Doesn't take much
to attack a trapped rat!

988
01:03:37,672 --> 01:03:39,006
Go back quietly!

989
01:03:39,131 --> 01:03:40,672
Let's fight it out!

990
01:03:40,797 --> 01:03:42,714
Whoever wins
gets to take the heads!

991
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:45,589
What the hell are you thinking?
Drive!

992
01:03:46,464 --> 01:03:48,047
How long have you been in business?

993
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:49,422
What is it, bro?
-What?

994
01:03:49,547 --> 01:03:52,214
Didn't have the guts to finish the job
once you had him!

995
01:03:52,339 --> 01:03:55,526
Now you raise your voice here, you prick?
Can you see?

996
01:03:55,739 --> 01:03:58,381
You said you'd ensure
I'd never see my daughter again.

997
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:01,339
I had no other options.

998
01:04:01,464 --> 01:04:03,547
I'll bury them and go about my way!
-Do it now.

999
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:05,922
I'm honestly not that type of man!

1000
01:04:06,047 --> 01:04:08,464
If I didn't say so,
you wouldn't have agreed to drive!

1001
01:04:08,589 --> 01:04:10,562
All those guys in the back
have families!

1002
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:12,089
Go!
-Why, sir?

1003
01:04:12,214 --> 01:04:13,547
No one will leave here alive!

1004
01:04:13,672 --> 01:04:15,464
Don't we people have families, too?

1005
01:04:16,339 --> 01:04:17,839
(A caller tune plays)

1006
01:04:23,256 --> 01:04:24,922
Mr. Ranga!
This is Saga's brother!

1007
01:04:25,047 --> 01:04:26,631
We've chased them this far!

1008
01:04:26,756 --> 01:04:29,089
Let's make a deal!
They burned five of our guys!

1009
01:04:30,089 --> 01:04:33,297
It's Saga's brother. He wants to make
a deal. Some of their men were burned.

1010
01:04:33,422 --> 01:04:34,631
What deal?
-Alright, sir.

1011
01:04:35,672 --> 01:04:37,256
I'll forget everything you said.

1012
01:04:38,078 --> 01:04:40,714
I'll drop you off
without a single scratch.

1013
01:04:41,922 --> 01:04:43,047
What will you give me?

1014
01:04:43,172 --> 01:04:46,006
I'll give you anything!
No time to bargain! Start the vehicle!

1015
01:04:46,131 --> 01:04:48,506
This is my time, sir.
-Alright. How much do you want?

1016
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:50,631
Who wants your money?
-Then what do you want?

1017
01:04:54,756 --> 01:04:56,631
A room for my daughter.

1018
01:04:59,131 --> 01:05:00,297
A fan just for her.

1019
01:05:02,756 --> 01:05:03,922
A bed.

1020
01:05:06,172 --> 01:05:07,589
A good school for her to study.

1021
01:05:11,672 --> 01:05:12,672
Can you do this?

1022
01:05:12,797 --> 01:05:14,589
Educating your child
is no big issue!

1023
01:05:14,714 --> 01:05:16,464
If they know you saved the I.G...
-Sir!

1024
01:05:17,665 --> 01:05:19,714
Will you make this happen?
-I will!

1025
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:20,839
Promise me.

1026
01:05:24,839 --> 01:05:26,006
Let's make a deal!

1027
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:29,756
You take three heads!
Leave two for me!

1028
01:05:30,689 --> 01:05:32,089
I also did the work, right?

1029
01:05:33,381 --> 01:05:34,964
I promise to do it!
Now step on it!

1030
01:05:35,089 --> 01:05:37,881
You may have done the work...
-You promise with the left hand?

1031
01:05:39,216 --> 01:05:40,881
What if you forget
in the morning?

1032
01:05:41,006 --> 01:05:42,797
Now you intrude
and negotitate?

1033
01:05:42,922 --> 01:05:45,006
Losers get no deals!
-Listen up!

1034
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:48,756
This is my daughter. I'll see to it
your daughter studies in her school!

1035
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:50,506
I swear upon my daughter.

1036
01:05:50,631 --> 01:05:51,631
Please drive!

1037
01:05:53,006 --> 01:05:54,006
Drive!

1038
01:05:54,131 --> 01:05:57,339
Let's pretend to agree.
Only four of them are here, right?

1039
01:05:57,464 --> 01:05:58,983
We'll kill all of them.

1040
01:05:59,092 --> 01:06:00,589
But one thing!

1041
01:06:00,714 --> 01:06:02,381
The guy who drove the vehicle?

1042
01:06:02,506 --> 01:06:04,297
The one with handcuffs?

1043
01:06:04,422 --> 01:06:05,964
He's mine!

1044
01:06:06,089 --> 01:06:07,381
Don't touch him!

1045
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,464
Stay there!
I'll call after wrapping this...

1046
01:06:10,589 --> 01:06:12,506
Where are you going?
We're surrounded!

1047
01:06:12,631 --> 01:06:14,047
What are you doing, bro?

1048
01:06:16,422 --> 01:06:18,797
You only know that I've been in prison
for ten years.

1049
01:06:20,172 --> 01:06:22,881
You don't know what I was doing
before I went to jail, right?

1050
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:06,144
Leave him.
They'll take care of him.

1051
01:07:06,269 --> 01:07:07,936
Go bring over those five cops.

1052
01:07:08,936 --> 01:07:09,936
Go, guys.

1053
01:07:29,352 --> 01:07:31,561
Hey!
Step aside.

1054
01:07:32,727 --> 01:07:33,769
Can't you listen...

1055
01:07:55,144 --> 01:07:56,144
Go!

1056
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,186
Go!
Attack him from the back!

1057
01:08:46,852 --> 01:08:47,977
Look here, bro!

1058
01:08:55,727 --> 01:08:56,727
Bro!

1059
01:08:58,519 --> 01:08:59,519
Bro!
Behind you!

1060
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:53,419
Look here, sir!

1061
01:10:10,018 --> 01:10:11,685
A man's in the back of the truck, bro!

1062
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,835
Until today, no one in my family
has even set foot in a police station!

1063
01:10:33,976 --> 01:10:36,749
Why?
They directly go to the court, huh?

1064
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,685
What do you study?
-Engineering.

1065
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:41,935
EC Engineering.

1066
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,435
You study engineering
and loiter drunk like so?

1067
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,060
That's why we loiter drunk, sir!

1068
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,393
Someone's breaking the gate, sir!

1069
01:11:06,768 --> 01:11:09,268
Get down, guys!
-Mani! Give everyone their weapons!

1070
01:11:20,768 --> 01:11:23,060
Listen up!
I don't care who is in there!

1071
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:25,226
You have five minutes!

1072
01:11:25,976 --> 01:11:29,476
Open the door!
I'll take my stuff and go on my way!

1073
01:11:29,601 --> 01:11:32,060
If I break in and enter,
none of you will remain alive!

1074
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:41,976
There about twenty to thirty people
at the entrance, sir.

1075
01:11:42,101 --> 01:11:43,185
What do I do, sir?

1076
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:45,851
Hold on, Napoleon.
Don't be afraid.

1077
01:11:45,976 --> 01:11:48,101
Where are you, sir?
-I'm on my way!

1078
01:11:48,226 --> 01:11:49,851
I'll call back. Hang up.
-Okay, sir.

1079
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:05,310
Sir!

1080
01:12:06,935 --> 01:12:08,393
See if there's another way in.

1081
01:12:08,518 --> 01:12:09,518
Come on, guys!

1082
01:12:12,935 --> 01:12:15,893
Go look that side!
-Who's in there?

1083
01:12:16,018 --> 01:12:19,476
Only one of them had a gun, sir.
Had to bring it with his holster. Here.

1084
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,726
Hey!
Light it up.

1085
01:12:25,185 --> 01:12:27,143
How long for the vehicle to be ready?

1086
01:12:27,268 --> 01:12:29,435
The clutch and brake have heated up.

1087
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,643
Take about 10-15 minutes
to cool down.

1088
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:34,518
Can't explain this to my mother.
Please handle this.

1089
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:37,185
This truck
is our family's livelihood!

1090
01:12:38,518 --> 01:12:39,601
Napoleon?
-Sir?

1091
01:12:40,393 --> 01:12:44,310
They're breaking everything! What to do?
-Hold on! Don't be scared!

1092
01:12:44,435 --> 01:12:46,351
Listen carefully to what I say.
-Alright.

1093
01:12:46,476 --> 01:12:48,476
Go to the cell at the top floor.

1094
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:49,768
Move aside.

1095
01:12:49,893 --> 01:12:52,185
They'll be a guy in a blue shirt.
Give him the phone.

1096
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:53,601
Alright.
-Wait. No need.

1097
01:12:53,726 --> 01:12:57,060
Ask the college kids
if any of them can make a video call.

1098
01:12:57,185 --> 01:13:00,226
What's going on?
-Can we make a video call on your phone?

1099
01:13:00,351 --> 01:13:02,643
Yes, we can.
-I'll call you from that, sir!

1100
01:13:06,976 --> 01:13:08,143
Who's in there?
Come out!

1101
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:13,351
Sir?
-Hold it this way and talk, sir.

1102
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:16,018
Tell me, sir.
-Hey, Blue shirt.

1103
01:13:16,143 --> 01:13:19,101
The one in the corner.
Step up front.

1104
01:13:19,226 --> 01:13:20,643
Can you see me?

1105
01:13:20,768 --> 01:13:22,768
Yes, sir.
-Talk to your guys who are outside.

1106
01:13:23,643 --> 01:13:25,351
The drugs you're after isn't here.

1107
01:13:25,476 --> 01:13:27,143
Tell him I'll let you guys go.

1108
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:29,393
No harm must come to my people there.
-Yes, sir.

1109
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:31,810
Ask him to give me a phone.

1110
01:13:31,935 --> 01:13:33,851
Give him your phone, Napoleon.
-Yes, sir.

1111
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:35,393
Give it.
-Here you go.

1112
01:13:39,101 --> 01:13:40,726
Get a Jio SIM once you get back!

1113
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:43,435
He's making a video call.
You're still looking for a signal!

1114
01:13:44,226 --> 01:13:45,226
Anbu?

1115
01:13:45,351 --> 01:13:46,726
Who is this?
-It's Shankar.

1116
01:13:46,851 --> 01:13:48,643
Where are you?
How did you get this phone?

1117
01:13:48,768 --> 01:13:52,435
The policeman...
he's on the phone right now.

1118
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,143
He's making a deal.

1119
01:13:54,268 --> 01:13:55,810
They'll let us go.

1120
01:13:55,935 --> 01:13:58,226
But we must not hurt
the people here.

1121
01:13:58,351 --> 01:13:59,685
Is my brother safe?

1122
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,351
Tell me.
Wasn't he with you?

1123
01:14:01,476 --> 01:14:03,393
He's on a video call, Anbu.

1124
01:14:03,518 --> 01:14:05,132
Say it in a way I'll understand!

1125
01:14:07,185 --> 01:14:08,226
The boss...

1126
01:14:08,351 --> 01:14:09,768
The cop...

1127
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:12,685
I said he's on the line.
-Is he inside?

1128
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:16,976
Yes, Anbu.
-Alright! I won't do anything!

1129
01:14:17,101 --> 01:14:18,351
No one here will come in!

1130
01:14:18,476 --> 01:14:20,149
No harm will come from my side!

1131
01:14:20,259 --> 01:14:22,717
Open the door and you guys come out!
Agree to the deal!

1132
01:14:22,842 --> 01:14:24,509
Agree to the deal!
-Alright, Anbu!

1133
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,800
He accepts the deal.
Open it up.

1134
01:14:28,759 --> 01:14:30,009
Tell everyone to back off.

1135
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:32,342
Open up the cell.
-Yes, sir.

1136
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:34,800
No harm will come to you all.
You may leave safely.

1137
01:14:34,925 --> 01:14:35,925
Alright.

1138
01:14:37,217 --> 01:14:38,217
What are they doing?

1139
01:14:46,425 --> 01:14:48,884
The seven guys who were caught
were low level thugs, sir.

1140
01:14:49,009 --> 01:14:50,550
They'll let us go.

1141
01:14:50,675 --> 01:14:53,259
But we must not hurt
the people here.

1142
01:14:53,384 --> 01:14:54,884
I said he's on the line.

1143
01:14:56,842 --> 01:14:59,675
Yes, Anbu.
He's inside.

1144
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,800
Open it up!

1145
01:15:01,842 --> 01:15:03,342
Alright, sir.
Come on.

1146
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:06,800
Truck's ready. Shall we go?
-Hold on!

1147
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:09,842
Yes, sir?
-Napoleon!

1148
01:15:09,967 --> 01:15:11,550
Opened the cell?
-I'm about to!

1149
01:15:11,675 --> 01:15:14,717
Don't do it. First listen to me.
-What is it, sir?

1150
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,592
Ask the names of those inside!
-Yes, sir.

1151
01:15:20,717 --> 01:15:21,717
What's your name?

1152
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:23,384
Hitler!

1153
01:15:23,509 --> 01:15:24,759
Your name?
-Gopal.

1154
01:15:24,884 --> 01:15:26,259
And you?
-Shankar.

1155
01:15:26,384 --> 01:15:27,384
You?
-Moorthy!

1156
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:29,592
Who is he?

1157
01:15:29,717 --> 01:15:31,509
Hey!
What's your name?

1158
01:15:31,634 --> 01:15:33,175
What?
Are you hard of hearing?

1159
01:15:35,592 --> 01:15:37,259
What happened?

1160
01:15:37,384 --> 01:15:38,592
My brother's inside.

1161
01:15:38,717 --> 01:15:40,675
They nabbed him
without knowing who he is.

1162
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,550
First, let him step out safely.

1163
01:15:42,675 --> 01:15:44,759
Then, we will kill everyone in there!

1164
01:15:45,925 --> 01:15:47,550
Hey!
What's your name?

1165
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:57,509
One of them's not telling me his name,
sir!

1166
01:15:57,634 --> 01:15:58,800
Step back.

1167
01:15:59,675 --> 01:16:00,884
He's Adaikalam.

1168
01:16:01,009 --> 01:16:03,425
If he's out,
he won't spare any of you.

1169
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:05,759
Whatever you do, don't open the door.
Back away!

1170
01:16:08,759 --> 01:16:10,134
Sir!
-Give me the key!

1171
01:16:10,259 --> 01:16:12,175
Ajay!
-I'll chop you up!

1172
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,467
Hurry up!

1173
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,092
Give it!
Give me the key!

1174
01:16:16,217 --> 01:16:17,550
Hello?
Napoleon?

1175
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:20,175
Give me the key!

1176
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,384
Give it!

1177
01:16:26,884 --> 01:16:27,884
Hurry up, guys!

1178
01:16:28,009 --> 01:16:29,800
Hurry! Let's go!
Where's Dilli?

1179
01:16:29,925 --> 01:16:31,634
He's looking for a signal there!
-Come!

1180
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:33,400
Give me the key!

1181
01:16:34,842 --> 01:16:36,884
Ajay!
-Throw me that key.

1182
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,384
Pick up that key!

1183
01:16:40,641 --> 01:16:41,593
Come on!

1184
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:45,433
Dilli!
Start the vehicle!

1185
01:16:45,558 --> 01:16:47,308
Only forty kilometers to go.
Hurry!

1186
01:16:48,224 --> 01:16:49,558
What happened?
Let's go!

1187
01:16:50,474 --> 01:16:51,474
What is it?

1188
01:16:52,974 --> 01:16:54,349
Toss it here!
-Ajay!

1189
01:16:54,474 --> 01:16:57,016
Toss me the key!
-They caught hold of him!

1190
01:16:57,141 --> 01:16:59,141
Throw me the key!
-He might die!

1191
01:16:59,266 --> 01:17:00,683
When I get out, I'll kill you!

1192
01:17:03,058 --> 01:17:04,349
Don't give it to him!

1193
01:17:05,933 --> 01:17:07,266
Shut the doors, guys!

1194
01:17:07,391 --> 01:17:08,724
Shut the doors!

1195
01:17:11,641 --> 01:17:12,641
Charge!

1196
01:17:31,891 --> 01:17:32,891
My child, sir.

1197
01:17:36,433 --> 01:17:37,854
If one has a child...

1198
01:17:39,099 --> 01:17:40,599
...they never die, right?

1199
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:43,681
She has my eyes.

1200
01:17:46,016 --> 01:17:48,688
She has her mother's nose and forehead.

1201
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:51,849
Even she used to get dimples
when she smiled.

1202
01:17:52,891 --> 01:17:54,150
She's in her, too.

1203
01:17:55,308 --> 01:17:56,683
Look how she stands, sir!

1204
01:17:58,183 --> 01:18:00,266
Does she look like a killer's daughter?

1205
01:18:00,391 --> 01:18:02,766
Doesn't she look like a cop's daughter?
-Yes, Dilli.

1206
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:05,141
I want to hold her right now!

1207
01:18:05,266 --> 01:18:07,558
Then come!
If we go quickly, you can see her soon!

1208
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,808
Will I see her, sir?
-Definitely, Dilli!

1209
01:18:09,933 --> 01:18:12,433
How much further, sir?
-We're halfway there, bro!

1210
01:18:12,558 --> 01:18:14,433
Cross the hill
and there's the hospital!

1211
01:18:14,558 --> 01:18:15,558
Let's go, sir.

1212
01:18:20,933 --> 01:18:23,224
Tips!
The vehicle's off.

1213
01:18:24,224 --> 01:18:25,224
His name is Dilli!

1214
01:18:26,016 --> 01:18:28,674
You must kill him first
to get close to the cops!

1215
01:18:29,308 --> 01:18:31,384
What did you say his name was?
-Dilli!

1216
01:19:15,769 --> 01:19:17,228
See if you can break any of these.

1217
01:19:19,269 --> 01:19:20,978
Break it all down!
Go!

1218
01:19:22,103 --> 01:19:23,478
Break them open!

1219
01:19:24,345 --> 01:19:25,732
Hit hard!
-Break it!

1220
01:19:27,626 --> 01:19:28,709
Break it!

1221
01:19:29,349 --> 01:19:31,349
Made out of forest wood!
Can't break it!

1222
01:19:31,415 --> 01:19:32,873
What is it?
-No, Anbu.

1223
01:19:32,998 --> 01:19:36,248
Seems like an old British building.
Really strong doors and windows.

1224
01:19:36,373 --> 01:19:38,165
Not so easy to break in.

1225
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:39,957
I'll see if there's another way in.

1226
01:19:40,082 --> 01:19:42,082
Three of you go look that side!

1227
01:19:42,808 --> 01:19:45,332
Where are you guys?
Hey, Tips!

1228
01:19:46,165 --> 01:19:47,873
Tell everyone to stop!
-Get down!

1229
01:19:47,998 --> 01:19:49,123
Hold on, guys!

1230
01:19:49,559 --> 01:19:50,684
Stop!

1231
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:52,540
Hey!

1232
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:56,248
They savagely beat everyone
and drove up the hill!

1233
01:19:56,373 --> 01:19:57,957
Who is he?

1234
01:19:58,082 --> 01:19:59,582
His name's Dilli.

1235
01:19:59,707 --> 01:20:01,332
It seems like he escaped prison.

1236
01:20:01,457 --> 01:20:03,082
He's going around with handcuffs.

1237
01:20:03,207 --> 01:20:05,165
Don't know why he's working
for the cops.

1238
01:20:06,082 --> 01:20:08,457
He gores like a rhino, Mr. Prabha.

1239
01:20:08,582 --> 01:20:11,498
He beat the crap
out of Krishna and Guna.

1240
01:20:11,623 --> 01:20:14,790
He sports holy ash on his head
and dances around like God!

1241
01:20:14,915 --> 01:20:18,082
Say you couldn't do it!
Don't bring God into this!

1242
01:20:18,207 --> 01:20:20,040
Ajay! I'm near Thavakudi!

1243
01:20:20,165 --> 01:20:22,832
Tell Tane that I asked him
to come to that high school!

1244
01:20:22,957 --> 01:20:23,998
I'll call back.

1245
01:20:25,123 --> 01:20:26,707
On my way, doctor!
-Bejoy!

1246
01:20:27,623 --> 01:20:31,832
Based on my research, chances are high
that this drug may be Rohypnol.

1247
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:34,082
So?
-It's a heavy sedative!

1248
01:20:34,207 --> 01:20:35,915
Even more dangerous.

1249
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,832
But no one can acquire this drug.

1250
01:20:37,957 --> 01:20:39,332
Hard to access it!

1251
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:43,540
Someone in your department
who handles drugs must've done this.

1252
01:20:44,707 --> 01:20:47,332
Already been three hours, Bejoy.
Hurry!

1253
01:20:47,457 --> 01:20:49,123
We delay further, people might die!

1254
01:20:49,248 --> 01:20:50,915
Alright, doctor.
On my way!

1255
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,165
'Even if a child forgets his mother...'

1256
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:55,748
'Or if a mother forgets her child...'

1257
01:20:55,873 --> 01:20:58,582
'If life forgets the body...'

1258
01:20:58,707 --> 01:21:01,082
'Or if the body forgets life...'

1259
01:21:01,207 --> 01:21:03,373
'Even if you forget
all you have learned...'

1260
01:21:03,498 --> 01:21:06,640
'Or if the eyes forget to blink...'

1261
01:21:07,707 --> 01:21:10,121
'The Lord who rooted us here...'

1262
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:13,790
'Namashivaaya...I shall never forget!'

1263
01:21:15,332 --> 01:21:16,748
Praise be to Lord Shiva!

1264
01:21:22,498 --> 01:21:24,957
Men have surrounded the hill!
They might hear you, bro!

1265
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:28,373
I don't believe in this sort of thing!

1266
01:21:29,082 --> 01:21:30,082
One day, you will.

1267
01:21:31,748 --> 01:21:33,130
How many guys on your side?

1268
01:21:34,165 --> 01:21:35,165
About seventeen.

1269
01:21:36,248 --> 01:21:38,968
How many guys on our side?
-About twenty, brother.

1270
01:21:39,836 --> 01:21:41,795
Let two guys watch
the centre of the hill.

1271
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,711
Forty of us will swoop down together!

1272
01:21:43,836 --> 01:21:45,753
One guy covers every ten feet!

1273
01:21:45,878 --> 01:21:48,086
What was his name?
Bombay? Delhi?

1274
01:21:49,086 --> 01:21:50,961
Let's see how he gets down this hill!

1275
01:21:57,461 --> 01:22:00,295
See that, sir? The guys who chased us
have surrounded the hill!

1276
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,378
Wherever the truck goes,
they'll attack!

1277
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:05,420
What do we do, Dilli?

1278
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,336
You tell me, sir.
I'll do it.

1279
01:22:08,461 --> 01:22:10,420
If I tell you,
you'll ask if I'm crazy.

1280
01:22:19,086 --> 01:22:19,943
Alright, tell me.

1281
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:22,477
Hey, Tips! Can you see me?
-It's the boss!

1282
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:24,852
Over here!
-Tell me!

1283
01:22:25,685 --> 01:22:27,094
Tell me!
-Do you hear me?

1284
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,518
Can you hear me?

1285
01:22:29,643 --> 01:22:30,810
Yes!

1286
01:22:30,935 --> 01:22:32,185
Listen up!

1287
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:35,286
There's an iron door behind this building!
-What?

1288
01:22:35,427 --> 01:22:36,599
Hoist me higher!

1289
01:22:37,102 --> 01:22:38,352
An iron door!

1290
01:22:38,477 --> 01:22:40,790
He's telling them of a way inside
from up there!

1291
01:22:48,279 --> 01:22:49,060
Saw what's down there?

1292
01:22:49,185 --> 01:22:52,193
Make it sound like it's nothing!
We get caught, only five die!

1293
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:54,518
You're trying to kill us all?
Are you crazy?

1294
01:22:55,435 --> 01:22:57,447
See that?
Said you'd react this way!

1295
01:22:57,518 --> 01:22:58,893
Now you yourself...

1296
01:22:59,018 --> 01:23:00,851
We're surrounded by forests!

1297
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,226
He's stopped atop the hill!

1298
01:23:03,351 --> 01:23:04,560
Don't know exactly where!

1299
01:23:06,018 --> 01:23:07,893
Come by Thittakudi!

1300
01:23:08,018 --> 01:23:09,351
See if there's a hill there!

1301
01:23:09,476 --> 01:23:10,893
What's wrong?
-What is it, bro?

1302
01:23:19,935 --> 01:23:21,810
They're just blubbering drunk!

1303
01:23:21,935 --> 01:23:24,351
Shut up and sleep!
Don't know the situation we're in!

1304
01:23:29,518 --> 01:23:31,726
An iron door!

1305
01:23:31,851 --> 01:23:33,476
Iron what?
-An iron door!

1306
01:23:33,601 --> 01:23:35,268
Iron door. Got it!
-In the back!

1307
01:23:35,393 --> 01:23:38,268
There's an iron door in the back!
-Head back!

1308
01:23:38,393 --> 01:23:39,643
An iron door!

1309
01:23:39,768 --> 01:23:42,643
Can I do something to ensure
no one out can hear him?

1310
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:43,935
What are you going to do?

1311
01:23:45,185 --> 01:23:46,185
Are you there?

1312
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:07,624
Guide me, O Lord Shiva!

1313
01:24:08,268 --> 01:24:10,435
Come on!
The truck's heading this way!

1314
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,185
Come!
We'll pin it down!

1315
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:13,851
Truck's coming this way!
Come on!

1316
01:24:29,851 --> 01:24:31,435
The truck's on that side!
Come on!

1317
01:24:33,726 --> 01:24:34,976
Get up!
Watch your step!

1318
01:25:41,726 --> 01:25:42,935
Come along, sir!

1319
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:51,226
Come quickly, sir!

1320
01:25:51,351 --> 01:25:53,518
Pull over somewhere, bro!
-Don't spare them!

1321
01:25:53,643 --> 01:25:55,060
Come on, guys!

1322
01:25:58,601 --> 01:26:00,310
Get in quickly!

1323
01:26:01,226 --> 01:26:02,393
Get in!

1324
01:26:07,393 --> 01:26:09,178
Come on, sir!
-Where's Sir?

1325
01:26:11,393 --> 01:26:12,768
He's out there!

1326
01:26:12,893 --> 01:26:14,560
Make sure he gets in!
-Come on, sir!

1327
01:26:16,643 --> 01:26:18,768
Come on, sir!
You're close!

1328
01:26:18,893 --> 01:26:20,726
Come! Take my hand, sir!
-Kill him!

1329
01:26:20,851 --> 01:26:22,427
Hurry up, sir!

1330
01:26:23,075 --> 01:26:23,833
Sir!

1331
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,685
They managed to strike him, bro!

1332
01:26:34,643 --> 01:26:36,601
What do we do now, bro?

1333
01:26:53,518 --> 01:26:54,643
Brother!

1334
01:26:54,768 --> 01:26:55,976
He's the guy, brother!

1335
01:26:59,518 --> 01:27:00,518
What the hell?

1336
01:27:00,643 --> 01:27:02,060
So much build-up!

1337
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,560
Hey!

1338
01:27:05,101 --> 01:27:06,518
I don't know who you are!

1339
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,810
I don't know why you work for the cops!

1340
01:27:09,935 --> 01:27:12,435
All I want are five guys inside the truck!

1341
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,560
Hey!
Give me that!

1342
01:27:14,685 --> 01:27:17,851
Bejoy, Thiru, Kumar, Joseph
and Sudhakar!

1343
01:27:17,976 --> 01:27:21,393
Just hand me these guys
and go on your way with the rest!

1344
01:27:21,518 --> 01:27:22,518
Hey!

1345
01:27:23,643 --> 01:27:26,143
I gave my word
that I'd drop them at their destination!

1346
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:31,325
Settle your dispute
after I've dropped them off!

1347
01:27:32,143 --> 01:27:34,101
Hey!
Go get them.

1348
01:27:34,226 --> 01:27:35,226
Shoot.

1349
01:27:37,726 --> 01:27:39,435
Bro...
-That chump has a gun!

1350
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:41,768
It's just a toy gun!
Go!

1351
01:27:41,893 --> 01:27:42,893
Pull the trigger!

1352
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:45,435
He's got a gun, brother!

1353
01:27:48,768 --> 01:27:50,393
If you're scared,
close your eyes!

1354
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:56,226
Are you a cop
to shoot below the knee?

1355
01:27:56,351 --> 01:27:58,226
He'll account for the bullets!

1356
01:27:58,351 --> 01:27:59,351
Blow their brains out!

1357
01:27:59,476 --> 01:28:00,476
Bravely step up!

1358
01:28:00,601 --> 01:28:03,101
Don't make stupid decisions
because of money!

1359
01:28:03,226 --> 01:28:04,643
He's shooting at us blindly!

1360
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:13,310
Shoot the thin guy in the corner!

1361
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:16,601
Two more bullets left!

1362
01:28:16,726 --> 01:28:18,638
If they dare to take a step,
shoot away!

1363
01:28:46,351 --> 01:28:49,060
Strong iron door!
Won't break even if we pound at it all day!

1364
01:28:49,185 --> 01:28:51,310
Break the wall!
-Talked like you're a big shot!

1365
01:28:57,101 --> 01:28:58,101
Go that side...

1366
01:29:14,393 --> 01:29:15,560
Hello?
-Careful!

1367
01:29:15,685 --> 01:29:17,810
What happened, Tips?
-No, Anbu.

1368
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:21,643
Some guy named Dilli got involved
and saved all the cops.

1369
01:29:21,768 --> 01:29:24,393
Took out about three groups, too.
-Aren't you ashamed?

1370
01:29:25,435 --> 01:29:27,226
Aren't you ashamed to say that?

1371
01:29:27,351 --> 01:29:28,351
Hey...

1372
01:29:28,935 --> 01:29:30,768
You better toss me the key
and get lost!

1373
01:29:35,197 --> 01:29:36,877
If I ever get out of here...

1374
01:29:37,476 --> 01:29:41,060
I'll kill not just you,
but every last member of your family!

1375
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:43,268
Toss me the key!

1376
01:29:43,393 --> 01:29:45,268
(A song plays loudly
in the music system)

1377
01:29:52,101 --> 01:29:53,476
Break it quickly!

1378
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:55,351
Hold on!
Come along!

1379
01:29:55,476 --> 01:29:57,685
(A fast paced song plays)

1380
01:30:06,143 --> 01:30:07,719
Why are you stopping?
Keep at it!

1381
01:30:09,018 --> 01:30:10,101
Break it open!

1382
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:16,310
Turn it off.

1383
01:30:22,226 --> 01:30:23,226
Turn that thing off.

1384
01:30:25,593 --> 01:30:26,968
Turn that damn thing off.

1385
01:30:27,585 --> 01:30:29,044
Turn that goddamn thing off!

1386
01:30:29,373 --> 01:30:30,498
Turn it off!

1387
01:30:30,623 --> 01:30:33,331
Once I'm out,
I won't bloody spare any one of you!

1388
01:30:34,873 --> 01:30:36,456
Can't handle one man?

1389
01:30:36,581 --> 01:30:39,206
They've arrested my brother!
All five cops must die!

1390
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:41,806
If you got guts,
don't call until it's done! Hang up!

1391
01:30:50,373 --> 01:30:51,498
Hey!
-Brother?

1392
01:30:51,623 --> 01:30:52,873
Start the vehicle!
-Okay!

1393
01:30:54,648 --> 01:30:55,648
Sampath!

1394
01:30:58,731 --> 01:30:59,731
Sampath!

1395
01:31:12,064 --> 01:31:13,939
Tips can't handle this situation!

1396
01:31:14,064 --> 01:31:15,356
You get going!

1397
01:31:15,481 --> 01:31:17,064
The cops should not reach here!

1398
01:31:18,189 --> 01:31:19,981
But the cargo is still inside!

1399
01:31:20,106 --> 01:31:21,523
I'll handle that!
Now go!

1400
01:31:24,106 --> 01:31:25,106
What happened?

1401
01:31:40,148 --> 01:31:41,087
Sir?

1402
01:31:41,423 --> 01:31:42,274
Sir?

1403
01:31:46,731 --> 01:31:47,898
Sprinkle water on him.

1404
01:31:54,564 --> 01:31:56,357
He's still not waking up, bro.

1405
01:31:59,689 --> 01:32:02,157
Bro...
You need to turn left here.

1406
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:11,314
Few folks in the list of Academy Toppers
haven't gotten a posting yet.

1407
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:13,606
Very likely they're working undercover now.

1408
01:32:13,731 --> 01:32:15,231
Tell me their names.

1409
01:32:15,356 --> 01:32:17,023
Just a minute, sir.

1410
01:32:17,148 --> 01:32:18,148
Sathya.

1411
01:32:18,273 --> 01:32:19,273
Sathya...

1412
01:32:20,064 --> 01:32:21,148
Gunasekaran.

1413
01:32:21,273 --> 01:32:22,273
Gunasekaran...

1414
01:32:22,466 --> 01:32:23,388
Ajaz Ahmed

1415
01:32:23,481 --> 01:32:24,481
Alright, hang up.

1416
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:49,939
How much longer?

1417
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:51,481
(A peppy song plays)

1418
01:32:52,375 --> 01:32:53,156
Ram!

1419
01:33:43,481 --> 01:33:44,481
Yes, this is it.

1420
01:33:44,606 --> 01:33:46,023
This is the place he mentioned.

1421
01:33:46,148 --> 01:33:48,564
Think there'll be no further problems, bro.

1422
01:33:49,814 --> 01:33:51,106
What do we do with him?

1423
01:33:52,106 --> 01:33:53,439
Hold his legs.

1424
01:34:00,981 --> 01:34:02,398
Prop his head up.

1425
01:34:12,218 --> 01:34:14,273
Where is he?
-At Thavakudi School, Tips!

1426
01:34:14,398 --> 01:34:16,273
You said he's going to a hospital.

1427
01:34:16,398 --> 01:34:19,314
Why's he going to a school?
-Did he give me a damn itinerary?

1428
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:20,439
Hurry up!

1429
01:34:32,898 --> 01:34:33,898
Good evening, sir!

1430
01:34:52,814 --> 01:34:55,109
Ram! Ravi!

1431
01:35:18,564 --> 01:35:19,731
They're done for, today!

1432
01:35:22,731 --> 01:35:23,856
Anbu!

1433
01:35:23,981 --> 01:35:25,689
Where's Anbu?
-I don't know, brother!

1434
01:35:25,814 --> 01:35:28,189
No path here. Check that side!
-Let's go!

1435
01:35:32,939 --> 01:35:34,023
Sir!

1436
01:35:34,148 --> 01:35:36,439
They're about to break the back door!

1437
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:40,148
Heeding your words, I made those four boys
and the girl stay back here!

1438
01:35:40,273 --> 01:35:41,856
When will you come?
-Sir...

1439
01:35:41,981 --> 01:35:43,689
Mr. Bejoy can't come to the phone now.

1440
01:35:43,814 --> 01:35:44,814
Who the hell are you?

1441
01:35:45,606 --> 01:35:47,939
Where is he?
Do you know what's going on here?

1442
01:35:48,064 --> 01:35:50,689
I do, sir!
Been a part of this since it began!

1443
01:35:50,814 --> 01:35:53,773
Don't be scared!
High ranking officials are on the way!

1444
01:35:53,898 --> 01:35:55,981
I've heard the same thing for hours!

1445
01:35:56,106 --> 01:35:57,981
If they get in,
they'll hack all of us up!

1446
01:35:58,106 --> 01:36:00,106
Mr. Bejoy'd have to answer for this!

1447
01:36:00,231 --> 01:36:01,898
First tell me who you are!

1448
01:36:02,023 --> 01:36:03,231
I'm just like you, sir.

1449
01:36:03,356 --> 01:36:05,481
A stranger in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1450
01:36:07,939 --> 01:36:09,273
Look in that place!
-Sir!

1451
01:36:09,398 --> 01:36:10,939
Do you see anyone?
-It's Anbu!

1452
01:36:13,606 --> 01:36:15,439
How many of you are in there?

1453
01:36:15,564 --> 01:36:18,064
Including the girl,
there are five people!

1454
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,939
Trusting him, I had them stay back!

1455
01:36:20,064 --> 01:36:22,564
Do they know who Mr. Bejoy is?

1456
01:36:22,689 --> 01:36:24,398
I haven't seen him myself!

1457
01:36:28,189 --> 01:36:30,023
The key is with that cop, Anbu!

1458
01:36:31,856 --> 01:36:33,523
First turn that bloody thing off!

1459
01:36:36,606 --> 01:36:40,314
Tell me, sir. How can they trust a guy
whom even you haven't seen before?

1460
01:36:40,439 --> 01:36:42,523
They trust you.

1461
01:36:43,481 --> 01:36:45,439
Only we must take care
of those who trust us.

1462
01:36:46,148 --> 01:36:48,564
What?
Afraid you'll die, huh?

1463
01:36:48,689 --> 01:36:50,814
Even if you die,
put up one hell of a fight, sir!

1464
01:36:51,731 --> 01:36:53,439
Don't die cowering in fear!

1465
01:36:53,564 --> 01:36:55,189
Sir...
-You're a cop, right?

1466
01:36:55,314 --> 01:36:58,062
If anyone dares to step in there,
beat the crap out of him!

1467
01:36:58,992 --> 01:36:59,804
Hello!

1468
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,039
Sir!

1469
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:52,148
Careful, bro!

1470
01:37:56,622 --> 01:37:58,021
Hold him, Ashok!

1471
01:38:00,939 --> 01:38:02,552
Don't let him go!
-Be Careful

1472
01:38:05,228 --> 01:38:06,768
Hit him!

1473
01:38:09,393 --> 01:38:11,352
Grab his leg!
-Give me a hand!

1474
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,018
Come on!
-Do something, sir!

1475
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:19,893
Careful, sir!

1476
01:38:20,018 --> 01:38:21,102
Back away, Tamizh!

1477
01:38:22,227 --> 01:38:24,143
Kick that knife away!

1478
01:38:24,268 --> 01:38:26,018
Don't go near him, Chittu!

1479
01:38:26,143 --> 01:38:27,185
Come here!

1480
01:38:32,477 --> 01:38:34,810
Where's the key?
-See if any door on the top is open!

1481
01:38:34,935 --> 01:38:36,018
Go look!

1482
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:37,893
Stop right there!

1483
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:21,435
Get up, sir!

1484
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,977
Break it, guys!

1485
01:39:27,852 --> 01:39:29,311
Bend those bars!

1486
01:39:40,893 --> 01:39:42,143
Come on!

1487
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:43,268
Go check that side!

1488
01:39:45,393 --> 01:39:46,393
Be careful!

1489
01:39:47,477 --> 01:39:49,227
No way here!
It's locked!

1490
01:39:49,352 --> 01:39:50,727
Look that side!

1491
01:39:50,852 --> 01:39:51,852
Come, Chittu!

1492
01:39:55,185 --> 01:39:56,477
Come on!
-Hold on!

1493
01:39:57,505 --> 01:39:58,643
Grab his hands!

1494
01:39:58,768 --> 01:39:59,935
Grab them!

1495
01:40:01,143 --> 01:40:02,268
Come, Tamizh!

1496
01:40:02,393 --> 01:40:04,102
Throw me your shawl!
-Here you go!

1497
01:40:04,227 --> 01:40:05,393
Hold him down!

1498
01:40:05,518 --> 01:40:06,852
Grab his hands!
-Tightly!

1499
01:40:06,977 --> 01:40:08,018
Tie it tightly, Ajay!

1500
01:40:13,527 --> 01:40:16,435
Bro!
This gun is so damn heavy!

1501
01:40:16,819 --> 01:40:19,110
Can't shoot with one hand
like they do in the movies!

1502
01:40:19,235 --> 01:40:20,777
It even drags me off to one side!

1503
01:40:21,777 --> 01:40:23,152
Somehow, I managed.

1504
01:40:25,027 --> 01:40:27,319
If I had not come along,
you two would've died, right?

1505
01:40:31,194 --> 01:40:32,652
What is this?
No one's come!

1506
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:34,819
Shall I go take a look?
-Just sit quietly.

1507
01:40:38,069 --> 01:40:39,610
Who are you, bro?

1508
01:40:40,194 --> 01:40:41,319
Why did you kill?

1509
01:40:42,485 --> 01:40:44,652
Just that you look like a killer.

1510
01:40:44,777 --> 01:40:46,235
But you don't seem to be one!

1511
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:48,194
That's why I asked.
Tell me, bro.

1512
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:50,541
Just mind your business.

1513
01:40:50,682 --> 01:40:52,572
Just tell me, bro.

1514
01:40:55,765 --> 01:40:56,765
Tell me.

1515
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:02,009
How old are you?
-Just turned 23!

1516
01:41:05,728 --> 01:41:07,645
When I was your age,
I had seen everything.

1517
01:41:10,811 --> 01:41:12,020
As long as I can remember...

1518
01:41:13,103 --> 01:41:16,228
...I was acclimated with fighting
and drinking. Remained that way!

1519
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:20,270
Viji.

1520
01:41:22,561 --> 01:41:23,728
If she had not come along...

1521
01:41:24,728 --> 01:41:26,603
...I would've been the same
until I died.

1522
01:41:28,103 --> 01:41:29,103
She looked so good!

1523
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,978
All eyes were on her!

1524
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:37,228
But she was really fond of me!

1525
01:41:39,478 --> 01:41:42,560
Dead set on marrying me,
she chased me all over and did so!

1526
01:41:45,561 --> 01:41:47,884
Our home was under a tarp on a platform!

1527
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:52,353
To her, it was like living in a palace.
She was so happy.

1528
01:41:53,895 --> 01:41:54,895
Every day...

1529
01:41:56,395 --> 01:41:59,478
She'd ask me to keep flowers on her hair.
Mark holy ash on her forehead.

1530
01:42:00,395 --> 01:42:03,811
She'd always swish around,
telling me to eat something she made.

1531
01:42:07,061 --> 01:42:08,895
I hadn't known what life was.

1532
01:42:10,212 --> 01:42:12,212
For the first time,
I wanted to live.

1533
01:42:16,045 --> 01:42:18,795
If someone's born blind,
just let them be.

1534
01:42:20,985 --> 01:42:23,146
But if you give them sight
for a while...

1535
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:25,670
...and yank it away
when they're happy?

1536
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:31,436
One day...
It was a Friday...

1537
01:42:32,894 --> 01:42:34,269
A Vijaykanth film.

1538
01:42:35,769 --> 01:42:38,978
Everyone in the platform
had gone for a late night show.

1539
01:42:40,936 --> 01:42:42,394
Only the two of us didn't go.

1540
01:42:42,947 --> 01:42:44,239
Because she was pregnant.

1541
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:49,187
We shut shop
and lay down to sleep.

1542
01:42:51,156 --> 01:42:52,156
All of a sudden...

1543
01:42:53,239 --> 01:42:54,864
...she screamed out to me!

1544
01:42:57,072 --> 01:42:58,239
When I opened my eyes...

1545
01:42:59,322 --> 01:43:00,864
...two bloody mongrels...

1546
01:43:02,114 --> 01:43:05,114
...without even caring she was pregnant,
were carrying her away!

1547
01:43:06,697 --> 01:43:07,864
What would you have done?

1548
01:43:10,572 --> 01:43:12,531
I beat them.
I beat them hard.

1549
01:43:13,864 --> 01:43:15,602
I beat them until they were dead!

1550
01:43:18,989 --> 01:43:20,864
When they arrested me
and took me away...

1551
01:43:22,031 --> 01:43:24,739
...that pregnant girl
stood in the middle of the road...

1552
01:43:26,281 --> 01:43:28,469
...and cried asking me not to leave her.

1553
01:43:33,322 --> 01:43:36,383
I didn't know back then
that it was the last time I'd ever see her.

1554
01:43:42,447 --> 01:43:43,947
In the blink of an eye...

1555
01:43:45,156 --> 01:43:46,322
...everything was gone.

1556
01:43:49,947 --> 01:43:51,156
Her voice...

1557
01:43:53,197 --> 01:43:54,406
The scent of her sweat...

1558
01:43:57,739 --> 01:43:59,489
I have those memories
keep me going.

1559
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:05,572
Bro...

1560
01:44:06,906 --> 01:44:08,406
Did she die?

1561
01:44:24,281 --> 01:44:26,739
What is it?
Why are you still up?

1562
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:29,239
No, sister...

1563
01:44:29,364 --> 01:44:33,447
I don't think anyone is coming
to visit me tomorrow.

1564
01:44:34,572 --> 01:44:36,281
Are you crazy?

1565
01:44:36,406 --> 01:44:39,572
I talked so much
but no one talked back.

1566
01:44:39,697 --> 01:44:42,104
Doesn't that mean
they don't like me?

1567
01:44:43,572 --> 01:44:45,697
Nothing of that sort.
You'll see.

1568
01:44:45,822 --> 01:44:47,239
They'll come to visit you.

1569
01:45:05,906 --> 01:45:07,406
Get going, brother.

1570
01:45:07,531 --> 01:45:09,923
Forget the truck.
I'll take care of it. You go!

1571
01:45:10,864 --> 01:45:12,739
How do I leave this halfway?

1572
01:45:13,864 --> 01:45:16,406
That's familiar territory to them.
They'll handle it.

1573
01:45:16,531 --> 01:45:18,406
You focus on meeting your child.
Go!

1574
01:45:19,406 --> 01:45:21,114
Like me, that man has a daughter, too.

1575
01:45:22,322 --> 01:45:23,322
He's a good man.

1576
01:45:23,447 --> 01:45:26,614
How do you know? What if he shows
his cop tricks in the morning?

1577
01:45:26,739 --> 01:45:28,781
I've been in jail for ten years
with evil men.

1578
01:45:29,781 --> 01:45:31,447
Good men look like temples to me.

1579
01:45:31,572 --> 01:45:35,947
Some big shot! You promised to meet a girl
who thought she was an orphan until now!

1580
01:45:36,072 --> 01:45:39,947
How would she feel if her dad
gets hacked to death on the way?

1581
01:45:40,072 --> 01:45:43,156
The govt. will protect the cop's family.
Who'll take care of yours?

1582
01:45:43,281 --> 01:45:45,864
Enough with helping others!
Go take care of your life!

1583
01:45:45,989 --> 01:45:47,531
I'm pleading with you.
Please go!

1584
01:45:48,781 --> 01:45:49,906
Just go, brother!

1585
01:45:59,322 --> 01:46:01,489
What do we do with him, sir?

1586
01:46:01,614 --> 01:46:04,506
Do you hear me, Anbu?
-Shall we lock him up in another cell?

1587
01:46:04,531 --> 01:46:07,156
Why aren't you replying?
-Hold on. Let me ask Sir.

1588
01:46:07,281 --> 01:46:08,281
Hey, Anbu!

1589
01:46:08,989 --> 01:46:11,281
Damn it!
Someone respond!

1590
01:46:12,156 --> 01:46:13,156
Anbu!

1591
01:46:21,579 --> 01:46:24,688
"The number you're calling
is switched off at the moment."

1592
01:46:43,242 --> 01:46:45,575
I sent someone
who can handle the arms.

1593
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:47,659
They stabbed him
near the checkpost, sir!

1594
01:46:47,784 --> 01:46:50,950
I don't know who did it or anything else.
-Alright, do this.

1595
01:46:51,075 --> 01:46:53,575
Put these two bodies
into the school bus and go.

1596
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:55,659
Alright.
-I've spoken to Dr. Amudhan.

1597
01:46:55,784 --> 01:46:59,200
It's very important that no one else
knows about this.

1598
01:46:59,325 --> 01:47:00,659
Got it?
-Alright, sir.

1599
01:47:00,784 --> 01:47:02,409
Take them to the Jojo Clinic.

1600
01:47:02,534 --> 01:47:04,450
Say it's an emergency.
He'll understand.

1601
01:47:04,575 --> 01:47:06,034
Okay.
-Let them remain with Ajay.

1602
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:07,159
Okay, sir.

1603
01:47:10,825 --> 01:47:11,992
Tell him you're leaving.

1604
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:19,117
You get going. I'll join up with the boys.
-Yes, sir.

1605
01:47:19,242 --> 01:47:20,367
Hey...

1606
01:47:20,492 --> 01:47:22,367
I came to see my child.

1607
01:47:23,075 --> 01:47:24,617
I've seen what she looks like.

1608
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,909
I've heard her voice, too.

1609
01:47:27,034 --> 01:47:29,034
Now I want her to be well!

1610
01:47:29,159 --> 01:47:30,867
This man offered to help with that!

1611
01:47:32,159 --> 01:47:34,867
What if I live through this
but something happens to him?

1612
01:47:34,992 --> 01:47:37,200
Both our kids' lives will be ruined!
-So?

1613
01:47:38,992 --> 01:47:42,325
It's not imporant for me to be with her.
Her happiness is more important.

1614
01:47:45,117 --> 01:47:48,875
I've decided to save that man's life,
even if it means I lose mine.

1615
01:47:49,075 --> 01:47:53,625
If she has a good school, think your child
will be happy even without her parents?

1616
01:47:54,367 --> 01:47:55,367
Hey...

1617
01:47:56,034 --> 01:47:57,409
You won't understand this.

1618
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:00,117
Can you do me a favor?

1619
01:48:01,909 --> 01:48:05,325
When I was in prison,
I worked in a bakery for three years.

1620
01:48:06,325 --> 01:48:08,117
With the money I saved from it...

1621
01:48:08,242 --> 01:48:10,700
...as I was wondering what to buy
for her...

1622
01:48:10,825 --> 01:48:13,825
...I remembered
that Viji loved 'jimikki' earrings.

1623
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:15,867
So, I bought the same.

1624
01:48:17,075 --> 01:48:19,196
If anything happens to me
at the Commissioner's office...

1625
01:48:19,626 --> 01:48:21,337
...can you get this to my daughter?

1626
01:48:24,575 --> 01:48:25,742
Be careful.

1627
01:48:29,825 --> 01:48:30,867
Say her father gave it.

1628
01:48:32,492 --> 01:48:34,242
If she asks where he was...
-In prison.

1629
01:48:34,367 --> 01:48:35,825
You dolt!

1630
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:37,200
What else do I say, brother?

1631
01:48:40,992 --> 01:48:43,385
Tell her I was a painter in Dubai.

1632
01:49:03,409 --> 01:49:05,464
We're going in a school bus, sir.

1633
01:49:06,242 --> 01:49:09,242
Yes, to a hospital.
I'll let Tips know which hospital.

1634
01:49:09,367 --> 01:49:11,825
That's an issue
between them and the cops.

1635
01:49:11,950 --> 01:49:13,284
They'll handle it.

1636
01:49:13,409 --> 01:49:16,700
But if Bejoy is left alive,
we'll be caught.

1637
01:49:16,825 --> 01:49:17,909
Sir...

1638
01:49:18,034 --> 01:49:19,325
Somehow, finish him off.

1639
01:49:20,325 --> 01:49:21,492
How do I do that, sir?

1640
01:49:21,617 --> 01:49:22,867
Don't be scared.

1641
01:49:22,992 --> 01:49:25,159
Bejoy's men can't do anything,
tonight.

1642
01:49:25,284 --> 01:49:28,909
Higher officials are involved with this.
So, they can't talk about this openly.

1643
01:49:29,034 --> 01:49:31,200
Do what I say.
We'll handle it.

1644
01:49:31,325 --> 01:49:32,742
Alright, sir.

1645
01:49:34,742 --> 01:49:36,867
Pull over, driver!
Stop!

1646
01:49:44,992 --> 01:49:46,659
Appears he's out of the funk, sir.

1647
01:49:46,797 --> 01:49:47,571
Sir!

1648
01:49:47,985 --> 01:49:48,696
Sir!

1649
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:52,234
I'm feeling better, sir.
Can I ride with you?

1650
01:50:01,034 --> 01:50:01,987
Chittu?

1651
01:50:02,322 --> 01:50:03,057
Chittu?

1652
01:50:04,712 --> 01:50:05,825
Does it hurt?

1653
01:50:09,078 --> 01:50:09,883
Hey..

1654
01:50:11,492 --> 01:50:12,492
Hey...

1655
01:50:13,601 --> 01:50:16,718
Sorry I slapped you.

1656
01:50:27,575 --> 01:50:28,700
I love you.

1657
01:50:35,075 --> 01:50:36,950
What happened, Anbu?
Look at me!

1658
01:50:37,075 --> 01:50:38,700
Look at me, I say!

1659
01:50:38,825 --> 01:50:41,075
Untie him!
Do it!

1660
01:50:41,992 --> 01:50:44,492
Give him the key!
-Release Anbu and I'll let him go!

1661
01:50:44,617 --> 01:50:47,409
He might do something! Give the key!
-Open up and I'll let him go!

1662
01:50:47,477 --> 01:50:50,075
Open the door!
-Who the hell are you to decide that?

1663
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,534
He's in your grasp
and you keep talking?

1664
01:50:52,659 --> 01:50:54,367
Take him out!
Do it!

1665
01:50:58,744 --> 01:50:59,911
Chittu!

1666
01:51:18,742 --> 01:51:21,492
Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I bloody tell you?

1667
01:51:21,617 --> 01:51:23,492
It's all your fault!

1668
01:51:23,617 --> 01:51:26,284
Had you given the key then,
he'd be alive right now!

1669
01:51:27,159 --> 01:51:31,117
Now just him, but him,
him and her!

1670
01:51:31,242 --> 01:51:33,325
There are thirty guys outside!

1671
01:51:33,450 --> 01:51:36,188
Thought about what would happen
to you all if they came in?

1672
01:51:38,242 --> 01:51:41,617
Brother!
I'll have the key in another two minutes!

1673
01:51:41,742 --> 01:51:44,159
We'll take the cargo
and go home together!

1674
01:51:44,284 --> 01:51:46,117
Together!
Now give me the key!

1675
01:51:46,242 --> 01:51:48,825
What happened?
Where are the rest of them?

1676
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:53,325
Anbu!

1677
01:51:56,450 --> 01:51:57,830
Chittu!

1678
01:52:00,075 --> 01:52:01,075
Chittu!

1679
01:52:03,649 --> 01:52:05,227
Chittu!

1680
01:52:10,325 --> 01:52:11,867
He's dead, sir!

1681
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:17,992
Didn't he stay back
because you asked him to, sir?

1682
01:52:20,284 --> 01:52:22,534
He's just a corpse now, sir!

1683
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:28,825
Get up!
-Do you hear that?

1684
01:52:30,524 --> 01:52:32,313
Chittu!

1685
01:52:59,784 --> 01:53:01,534
Talk to me, Anbu!

1686
01:53:02,534 --> 01:53:03,534
Anbu!

1687
01:53:04,409 --> 01:53:06,575
Can you hear me, Anbu?
-Hey, Anbu!

1688
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:08,325
Say something, Anbu!
-Come on!

1689
01:53:10,424 --> 01:53:11,455
Anbu!

1690
01:53:12,825 --> 01:53:15,007
They did something to Anbu, brother!

1691
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:16,288
Anbu!
-Anbu!

1692
01:53:16,577 --> 01:53:18,537
Hey Anbu...

1693
01:53:19,162 --> 01:53:21,116
What have you done to Anbu?

1694
01:53:22,909 --> 01:53:25,075
Tips! Ram!
Where are you guys?

1695
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:26,992
What happened to Anbu?

1696
01:53:27,117 --> 01:53:29,617
Go check the back side!
Move!

1697
01:53:33,492 --> 01:53:34,909
You're all dead meat!

1698
01:53:35,784 --> 01:53:36,867
Open the door!

1699
01:53:36,992 --> 01:53:38,367
Open the damn door!

1700
01:53:50,784 --> 01:53:52,539
Ajaz Ahmed.

1701
01:54:28,075 --> 01:54:30,617
Once we cross the quarry,
we reach town!

1702
01:54:30,742 --> 01:54:33,159
Easy to go to the Commissioner's office
from there.

1703
01:55:05,575 --> 01:55:06,575
Sir...

1704
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:09,075
No matter what,
don't leave the vehicle.

1705
01:55:18,909 --> 01:55:20,159
Listen up!

1706
01:55:21,075 --> 01:55:23,034
The cops you're looking for
are not here.

1707
01:55:23,159 --> 01:55:25,325
I've sent them off!
I'm Dilli!

1708
01:55:25,950 --> 01:55:27,325
I got this, sir.
Get back!

1709
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:29,492
I beat up your guys.

1710
01:55:29,617 --> 01:55:31,413
Got anything to discuss,
take it up with me...

1711
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:32,398
Bro...

1712
01:55:32,867 --> 01:55:33,554
Dilli!

1713
01:55:34,325 --> 01:55:36,325
This is it, sir!
He tipped them off!

1714
01:55:38,077 --> 01:55:39,054
Dilli

1715
01:55:43,825 --> 01:55:45,992
Hey! The gun has no bullets!
Come on, guys!

1716
01:55:46,117 --> 01:55:47,409
Let him go!
-Come on!

1717
01:55:53,069 --> 01:55:54,784
Come quickly!

1718
01:55:54,909 --> 01:55:56,659
No! Listen to me!
Now go!

1719
01:55:58,867 --> 01:55:59,992
Get going, I say!

1720
01:56:03,909 --> 01:56:05,117
If I ever catch you...

1721
01:56:24,950 --> 01:56:25,950
Just finish him off!

1722
01:56:28,242 --> 01:56:29,242
Tell me!

1723
01:56:30,284 --> 01:56:31,825
Sent them off in a school bus, huh?

1724
01:56:32,992 --> 01:56:33,992
To which hospital?

1725
01:56:35,617 --> 01:56:36,784
I don't know.

1726
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:38,950
"Don't know"?

1727
01:56:44,075 --> 01:56:45,165
You don't know, eh?

1728
01:56:47,450 --> 01:56:50,200
Make the guys check
every hospital in the area!

1729
01:56:50,325 --> 01:56:52,075
Check if a school bus
is parked there!

1730
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:53,575
Let's see how they escape!

1731
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:55,117
First let's finish him off!

1732
01:56:56,284 --> 01:56:57,284
Drop the rock.

1733
01:56:57,409 --> 01:57:00,534
You'll leave once your job's done!
I'll be in trouble if he stays alive!

1734
01:57:00,659 --> 01:57:02,284
Let's kill him!
-Drop it, I say!

1735
01:57:09,659 --> 01:57:11,954
Can't nab one schmuck?
Hurry!

1736
01:57:13,034 --> 01:57:14,742
He must be around there!
Search!

1737
01:57:14,867 --> 01:57:16,659
Quit calling repeatedly!

1738
01:57:16,784 --> 01:57:17,899
Catch him and get here!

1739
01:57:18,784 --> 01:57:20,992
Call your man in the bus.

1740
01:57:22,325 --> 01:57:24,367
I've asked you many times!
Do it!

1741
01:57:24,492 --> 01:57:27,159
Give that to me, sir.
I'll handle it.

1742
01:57:27,284 --> 01:57:28,325
Just give it!

1743
01:57:35,075 --> 01:57:36,075
Come here!

1744
01:57:37,096 --> 01:57:39,471
Take the gun in my pocket, sir!

1745
01:57:40,575 --> 01:57:42,075
Don't hesitate!
Take it, sir!

1746
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:43,669
There's no time.
Hurry!

1747
01:57:45,367 --> 01:57:46,765
I think you got busted.

1748
01:57:48,534 --> 01:57:49,534
I'm sorry.

1749
01:57:51,492 --> 01:57:52,867
You should've left back then.

1750
01:57:53,784 --> 01:57:55,034
Because of me...

1751
01:58:01,367 --> 01:58:03,325
If you had a shave,
he'd look just like you!

1752
01:58:03,992 --> 01:58:04,992
Right?

1753
01:58:09,742 --> 01:58:10,742
Don't!

1754
01:58:11,992 --> 01:58:13,534
Let him go!

1755
01:58:15,534 --> 01:58:16,742
No!
Let him go!

1756
01:58:18,367 --> 01:58:20,159
No!
Just leave him alone!

1757
01:58:23,075 --> 01:58:24,075
Ajaz!

1758
01:58:33,742 --> 01:58:36,138
Now do you realize
who the sheep is, Sampath?

1759
01:58:41,409 --> 01:58:43,367
My name isn't Sampath.

1760
01:58:43,492 --> 01:58:44,492
It's Ajaz Ahmed!

1761
01:58:45,575 --> 01:58:48,284
Batch of 2016!
Academy Topper!

1762
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:52,117
I've been by your side
for two years.

1763
01:58:53,242 --> 01:58:54,825
And you didn't even know!

1764
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:56,534
You're the damn sheep!

1765
01:59:01,992 --> 01:59:02,992
Ajaz!

1766
01:59:08,575 --> 01:59:10,117
Hey!
Toss him out.

1767
01:59:11,367 --> 01:59:12,992
He's up!
Grab him!

1768
01:59:13,117 --> 01:59:14,117
Hit him!

1769
01:59:47,692 --> 01:59:48,942
We must get them out!

1770
01:59:56,434 --> 01:59:57,767
What happened, Jaga?

1771
01:59:57,852 --> 01:59:59,602
They blocked everything, brother!

1772
01:59:59,727 --> 02:00:01,102
There's no way to get in!

1773
02:00:05,644 --> 02:00:06,810
Pull, guys!

1774
02:00:10,477 --> 02:00:12,227
Come along!

1775
02:00:13,477 --> 02:00:15,429
We got him!
He's got something in his pocket!

1776
02:00:15,484 --> 02:00:18,394
He won't let us take it!
-Don't spare anything! Check him!

1777
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,958
Let go!
-Tips! Gaja's calling!

1778
02:00:21,083 --> 02:00:22,833
Something happened to Anbu!
-What?

1779
02:00:22,958 --> 02:00:25,000
He called many times.
Seems you didn't pick up!

1780
02:00:25,125 --> 02:00:26,375
Let go of me!

1781
02:00:28,875 --> 02:00:30,542
Give me that!
-Earrings, brother!

1782
02:00:31,125 --> 02:00:32,167
What happened to Anbu?

1783
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:34,333
I'm coming!
Hang up!

1784
02:00:34,693 --> 02:00:36,500
Brother!
Look!

1785
02:00:38,042 --> 02:00:41,000
Brother! They snatched the earrings
you bought for your child!

1786
02:00:41,125 --> 02:00:42,667
Open your eyes and look, brother!

1787
02:00:44,125 --> 02:00:45,292
Are you kidding around?

1788
02:00:45,917 --> 02:00:49,000
They broke the earrings
you bought for your child, brother!

1789
02:00:50,458 --> 02:00:52,542
They broke your child's earrings!

1790
02:00:54,792 --> 02:00:56,292
Brother!

1791
02:00:56,417 --> 02:00:58,208
Open your eyes, brother!

1792
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:12,500
Stab him properly!

1793
02:01:24,269 --> 02:01:25,769
Ajaz!

1794
02:01:25,894 --> 02:01:27,872
Don't die on me, Ajaz!
Open your eyes!

1795
02:01:28,771 --> 02:01:31,333
Run over the door with the car!
I'm on my way!

1796
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:45,407
Open your eyes, Ajaz!

1797
02:02:52,394 --> 02:02:53,571
Don't let him go!

1798
02:02:56,852 --> 02:02:59,935
You promised to meet a girl
who thought she was an orphan until now!

1799
02:02:59,992 --> 02:03:04,140
How would she feel if her dad
gets hacked to death on the way?

1800
02:03:06,685 --> 02:03:08,394
Do you want to see your daughter or not?

1801
02:03:09,532 --> 02:03:11,357
Hello! I am Amudha speaking

1802
02:03:11,490 --> 02:03:13,557
Are you coming to see me tommorrow

1803
02:03:13,732 --> 02:03:14,693
Hello!

1804
02:03:15,894 --> 02:03:16,894
Will I see her, sir?

1805
02:03:19,102 --> 02:03:20,102
How are we related?

1806
02:05:32,156 --> 02:05:33,156
Sir!

1807
02:05:34,489 --> 02:05:35,656
Are you still alive, sir?

1808
02:05:36,739 --> 02:05:38,156
If yes,
get inside the vehicle!

1809
02:05:38,989 --> 02:05:39,989
Let's go!

1810
02:05:45,864 --> 02:05:47,073
Come, dear!

1811
02:05:47,198 --> 02:05:49,531
Listen to me!
Come, let's go!

1812
02:05:49,656 --> 02:05:52,198
Don't know what they'll do
if they come in! Let's go!

1813
02:05:53,406 --> 02:05:54,406
Come on!

1814
02:05:56,531 --> 02:05:57,656
Everyone head up!

1815
02:05:58,573 --> 02:05:59,823
Keep going!
Don't stop!

1816
02:05:59,948 --> 02:06:02,114
Break it open!

1817
02:06:02,614 --> 02:06:04,864
Get inside!
Go in, dear!

1818
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:08,560
Sir! Sir! Sir!...

1819
02:06:09,698 --> 02:06:15,008
If they're in, no matter what happens,
they must not lay hands on her! See to it.

1820
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:30,406
Break it!

1821
02:06:30,531 --> 02:06:31,614
Hit it harder!

1822
02:06:31,739 --> 02:06:34,531
Rip out that tree and slam it here!
Bring whatever you find!

1823
02:06:37,117 --> 02:06:39,114
Break it open!

1824
02:06:39,239 --> 02:06:41,198
Hit it hard!

1825
02:06:41,323 --> 02:06:42,323
Come this side!

1826
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,614
Break it open!

1827
02:07:02,739 --> 02:07:04,739
Move aside!
-Where are you going?

1828
02:07:04,864 --> 02:07:06,906
This building...
-Give me the key, sir.

1829
02:07:12,156 --> 02:07:13,864
Hit it hard!

1830
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:21,624
Hey Dilli!

1831
02:07:22,614 --> 02:07:25,198
No matter what,
Adaikalam must not get out!

1832
02:07:25,906 --> 02:07:28,823
The boys will be here in...
-That's a cop's problem, sir.

1833
02:07:28,948 --> 02:07:30,739
There are others like me
stuck in there.

1834
02:07:30,864 --> 02:07:32,281
Who will save them?

1835
02:07:34,507 --> 02:07:35,757
Got any left?

1836
02:07:35,882 --> 02:07:37,048
Booze, kiddo!

1837
02:07:39,757 --> 02:07:41,007
Break it open!

1838
02:07:41,132 --> 02:07:42,382
Break the window!

1839
02:08:02,949 --> 02:08:03,949
Sir...

1840
02:08:04,715 --> 02:08:07,757
You've sworn upon your child
that you'll give my child a good life.

1841
02:08:08,548 --> 02:08:12,711
If you think when I'm dead,
I wouldn't know that you broke your word...

1842
02:08:13,590 --> 02:08:15,291
...I'll kill you, sir!

1843
02:08:17,257 --> 02:08:20,092
Break it down!
Harder!

1844
02:08:28,798 --> 02:08:29,798
Brother!

1845
02:08:30,965 --> 02:08:31,965
Be careful.

1846
02:08:34,715 --> 02:08:36,257
Break it open!

1847
02:08:58,132 --> 02:08:59,132
Sir!

1848
02:09:00,673 --> 02:09:01,673
Let's go, sir!

1849
02:09:02,548 --> 02:09:03,632
I'm with Mr. Bejoy.

1850
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:05,340
He's right outside.

1851
02:09:09,715 --> 02:09:10,715
Where are those kids?

1852
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:12,340
Upstairs.

1853
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:23,600
Who is this guy?

1854
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:30,954
Get going!
They're waiting outside!

1855
02:09:31,507 --> 02:09:33,673
Come, Tamizh!
-Come on!

1856
02:09:33,798 --> 02:09:35,680
Come, dear!
-Who is he, sir?

1857
02:09:50,798 --> 02:09:52,257
Another truck out back!
Get in!

1858
02:09:52,382 --> 02:09:54,257
This way!
-Come, Tamizh!

1859
02:09:54,382 --> 02:09:55,882
Go!
-Get going!

1860
02:09:56,007 --> 02:09:57,007
Get going, I say!

1861
02:09:58,048 --> 02:09:59,048
Go, dear!

1862
02:10:00,798 --> 02:10:02,468
A lost life won't come back.

1863
02:10:03,798 --> 02:10:05,048
I'll bring him.
Now go!

1864
02:10:06,090 --> 02:10:08,141
Take her and go, sir!
-Go, dear.

1865
02:10:08,175 --> 02:10:09,425
Don't stop!

1866
02:10:16,947 --> 02:10:19,280
You keep going, kids.
I'll be back.

1867
02:10:19,405 --> 02:10:21,863
Where are you going?
-Go up those stairs. I'll tell you.

1868
02:10:21,887 --> 02:10:23,311
Sir! Sir!...

1869
02:10:24,530 --> 02:10:26,488
Where are you going?
-Take them up. I'll come!

1870
02:10:26,613 --> 02:10:27,655
Come on, sir!

1871
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:30,113
Come here, kid!
Here you go!

1872
02:10:30,238 --> 02:10:31,947
Careful!
-Take him and go! I'll come!

1873
02:10:32,613 --> 02:10:33,613
Sir!

1874
02:10:39,363 --> 02:10:40,988
Look at this!
-Come on, sir.

1875
02:10:41,113 --> 02:10:44,155
This is why those godforsaken mongrels
are creating such a ruckus!

1876
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:46,572
Even if I die,
I won't let them take this!

1877
02:10:46,697 --> 02:10:48,822
I'll burn down this entire thing!

1878
02:10:48,947 --> 02:10:51,447
Let's see even if an ounce remains!
I'll burn it all!

1879
02:10:52,322 --> 02:10:53,613
I'll hit you hard!

1880
02:10:53,738 --> 02:10:56,197
They slit his throat
right before my eyes!

1881
02:10:56,322 --> 02:10:58,863
Poor kid suffered!
He'd be my son's age.

1882
02:10:59,250 --> 02:11:01,062
He died!

1883
02:11:02,738 --> 02:11:05,197
You guys are done for!

1884
02:11:07,905 --> 02:11:10,280
Let's see how
you get your stuff!

1885
02:11:17,836 --> 02:11:19,572
Found it?
-See what this is, sir!

1886
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:31,072
They're drug peddling monsters!

1887
02:11:33,197 --> 02:11:35,905
If they ever get their hands on
what's in here...

1888
02:11:36,030 --> 02:11:38,280
...they'll ruin the lives of students!

1889
02:11:40,030 --> 02:11:41,405
We must not spare them!

1890
02:11:45,572 --> 02:11:46,572
Break it open!

1891
02:12:07,725 --> 02:12:09,572
Hold it tightly. Don't let go.
-Who's this?

1892
02:12:09,697 --> 02:12:10,822
I don't know, brother.

1893
02:12:12,238 --> 02:12:13,655
How does this work?

1894
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:14,953
Press that red button.

1895
02:12:23,655 --> 02:12:26,344
What's he got?
-Looks like a bug spray machine!

1896
02:12:33,030 --> 02:12:34,030
Come on!

1897
02:12:35,905 --> 02:12:36,905
Now hit it!

1898
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:27,405
It's nothing.
You're fine!

1899
02:15:28,113 --> 02:15:29,196
Check him out, Vignesh.

1900
02:16:11,155 --> 02:16:13,976
Plenty of cops outside!
What's wrong?

1901
02:16:16,113 --> 02:16:18,030
I'm talking to you!
What happened?

1902
02:16:29,185 --> 02:16:30,349
Sir!

1903
02:16:30,575 --> 02:16:31,560
Dilli!

1904
02:16:32,030 --> 02:16:33,321
Brother?
-Dilli?

1905
02:16:34,071 --> 02:16:35,488
The Sir is here.

1906
02:16:35,613 --> 02:16:36,696
Get down.

1907
02:16:37,988 --> 02:16:39,613
What happened, sir?

1908
02:16:42,613 --> 02:16:44,158
What is it?
-Show me your hands.

1909
02:16:58,696 --> 02:16:59,946
Go.

1910
02:17:00,071 --> 02:17:01,071
What is it, sir?

1911
02:17:01,196 --> 02:17:02,569
Go and see.

1912
02:17:25,738 --> 02:17:26,905
Is that my daughter, sir?

1913
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:29,780
Come!

1914
02:17:33,905 --> 02:17:35,071
Just come!

1915
02:17:39,030 --> 02:17:40,797
I'm scared!
-Come, dear.

1916
02:17:47,113 --> 02:17:49,071
Go talk to him!
-What do I say, sir?

1917
02:17:49,196 --> 02:17:50,613
Just go!
She'll talk to you.

1918
02:18:26,446 --> 02:18:28,202
Are you my father?

1919
02:18:32,407 --> 02:18:33,751
What's your name?

1920
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:39,423
Dilli.

1921
02:18:40,007 --> 02:18:41,257
Why are you crying?

1922
02:18:44,757 --> 02:18:45,796
I'm not crying, dear.

1923
02:18:47,548 --> 02:18:50,539
All this while,
why didn't you come and see me?

1924
02:18:58,715 --> 02:19:00,090
Please forgive me, dear!

1925
02:19:09,257 --> 02:19:10,289
Don't cry.

1926
02:19:12,048 --> 02:19:13,273
Don't cry.

1927
02:19:17,968 --> 02:19:18,882
Dad...

1928
02:19:20,298 --> 02:19:21,383
Don't cry, dad!

1929
02:19:23,882 --> 02:19:25,048
My precious!

1930
02:19:29,882 --> 02:19:32,757
You'll never leave me again,
will you, dad?

1931
02:19:32,882 --> 02:19:34,257
I will not, dear!

1932
02:19:34,382 --> 02:19:36,048
I'll never leave you again.

1933
02:19:42,090 --> 02:19:43,590
I won't go anywhere
without you.

1934
02:20:00,798 --> 02:20:01,923
So, Dilli...

1935
02:20:02,048 --> 02:20:03,649
Is she like your dear Viji?

1936
02:20:08,429 --> 02:20:09,492
Sir!

1937
02:20:10,903 --> 02:20:11,786
Sir!

1938
02:20:12,261 --> 02:20:13,544
Hey! Dilli

1939
02:20:14,007 --> 02:20:15,715
Some men will meet you tomorrow.

1940
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:18,507
They'll arrange for everything
you asked for your child.

1941
02:20:20,590 --> 02:20:22,923
I knew you'd do everything
for my child, sir.

1942
02:20:23,923 --> 02:20:24,923
I...

1943
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:34,673
If I give something,
will you accept it?

1944
02:20:35,268 --> 02:20:36,310
What is it?
Give me.

1945
02:20:40,977 --> 02:20:42,310
It's a little broken.

1946
02:20:44,185 --> 02:20:45,265
But pure gold, sir.

1947
02:20:46,185 --> 02:20:47,685
Can you give it to your daughter?

1948
02:20:48,685 --> 02:20:49,685
Alright.

1949
02:20:49,810 --> 02:20:51,634
I'll tell her Uncle Dilli gave it.

1950
02:21:02,227 --> 02:21:04,102
Who is he, sir?

1951
02:21:04,227 --> 02:21:06,727
He wasn't involved with this,
but ruined everything!

1952
02:21:09,810 --> 02:21:11,227
He is involved with it!

1953
02:21:12,018 --> 02:21:13,508
His name is Dilli!
