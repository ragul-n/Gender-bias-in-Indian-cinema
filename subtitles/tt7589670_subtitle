1
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:36,299
You seem to be educated sir,
why are you in jail?

2
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:41,965
That is a big story.
It is a time waste to say.

3
00:01:45,113 --> 00:01:48,549
What are such important works
for us here sir, to waste the time?

4
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:51,272
Say at least for time pass sir.

5
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,840
When every kid searches his happiness
in playing and songs,

6
00:01:56,722 --> 00:01:59,882
my son searched for it in my words.

7
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,715
What great words have you said sir?

8
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:10,359
Oh dear... my baby... Do not cry dear.

9
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:17,717
Hey, at least ten girls
will be flat even now if I smile.

10
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:19,631
Change the toothpaste,
maybe a foul smell is coming.

11
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:25,369
Hubby, it is not to say some jokes
and make all laugh.

12
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:27,088
Do something and make him stop crying.

13
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:30,006
Come dear, come on...
My darling son...

14
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:34,383
Sleep my dear, do not cry.
Do not cry my son, do not cry.

15
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:37,380
Hey, change the tooth paste.
May be bad smell is coming.

16
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:41,630
He is joking on us,
hit this uncle of ours.

17
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:52,754
Come on hit, hit even dad.

18
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:58,878
Come on hit son, hit this uncle of
ours, son. Smile, hit... smile, hit.

19
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,754
Wow, you made him stop greatly.

20
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:06,254
My dear son, come darling come on.

21
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:13,464
Husband or a joke,
bring him to me if he cries again. Ok!

22
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:15,919
Hubby, he is not eating Cerelac.

23
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:20,044
Is he crying, give him to me.
Give him to me, I will make him smile.

24
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:23,793
Come on give.
Look, I will make him smile.

25
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:28,603
Look there son, look at the TV.

26
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:31,169
See how are they hitting.
Yes, see how are they hitting.

27
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:45,293
No, I will not go to school.

28
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,679
Hubby, he is started crying again.

29
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,627
Leave him to me.

30
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:54,629
Son, here is the auto uncle.
Hit the auto uncle, hit.

31
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,792
Hit, come on hit.

32
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:04,333
that is my son. Look, he is smiling.
Go now, go to the school dear. Go.

33
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:09,875
He is been hitting from then
and the public had been scolding me.

34
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:24,207
You should have hit him once sir,
he would have set right.

35
00:04:25,086 --> 00:04:26,416
What did you study?

36
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:28,303
Tenth fail sir.

37
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:31,958
I cleared groups,
do not give waste ideas.

38
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:34,457
Even that was done.

39
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:37,832
Hey, it seems you hit Bunty?

40
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:43,415
No use now, this is become a
habit for you. Come on stretch your hand.

41
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:51,499
You should cry when hit,
but why do you enjoy it?

42
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,956
Happy if I hit or if I get it.
Come on hit.

43
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:58,706
Happy if I hit or if he get hit?
What is that craze sir?

44
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:02,206
If he was so then,
what is the present position?

45
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:56,622
What happened next sir?

46
00:08:58,694 --> 00:08:59,722
Look there.

47
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:04,570
Are you students or idiots?
Why are you fighting so on the roads?

48
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:10,361
If I see you again in any fights,

49
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:14,781
I will book you under PD act
and push you in lockup. Understood?

50
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:15,486
I understood sir.

51
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:20,406
Note down names and addresses of these
two batches guys and send them.

52
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:21,155
Ok sir.
- Go.

53
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:24,068
You go that way.
- You come this way.

54
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,985
Which batch are you?

55
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:31,401
I am from no batch sir.

56
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:32,068
Then?

57
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:34,580
While going on the road, they looked
interesting holding the rods sir.

58
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,651
and I participated.

59
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:39,109
Is this any reality show to participate?
What are you studying?

60
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:41,775
What are you studying?
CSE third year in CBIT sir.

61
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,484
When your dad is spending
lakhs for your studies,

62
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:51,442
you are onto the roads into fights
without having any responsibilities,

63
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:55,025
You know how much would
your dad feeling knowing this?

64
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:58,399
He knows sir. In fact,
he encouraged me from childhood sir,

65
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:08,108
Call your father once urgently
to the station,

66
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,169
This has become a
habit to this fellow sir.

67
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:12,944
Push this idiot into the lock up
and he would get to know.

68
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:13,550
Dad...

69
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,485
Hey constable.

70
00:10:14,565 --> 00:10:15,220
Sir.

71
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:18,568
Leave this kid and keep him
in the lock up till evening.

72
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:19,777
Sir.

73
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:22,482
Which law has said to push father inside
when son has done a mistake sir?

74
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:26,293
Then which law said to hit
the guy beside when kid cries?

75
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:30,117
Have you said it all...
- Yes.

76
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,565
Sir, just for this time...

77
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:40,732
Not just for once, but I will arrest you
whenever he is into any fight in life.

78
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:42,023
That is the matter.

79
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:51,189
Sir, you fell in the eyes of
this CI as your fate drank fanta.

80
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,813
He is a big sadist. He stuffs spice
from down and an ice cream in the mouth.

81
00:10:57,233 --> 00:11:00,230
Change your son if possible
or leave this town.

82
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,865
If you feel why you should listen
to the advice of a tenth fail candidate,

83
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:09,009
we shall regularly meet at the same place.
Even the story would continue.

84
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:19,312
What happened, any nightmare?

85
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:23,520
Yes hubby! Four guys not liking
our son have chopped you down.

86
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:27,062
Even my fear is the same.
No idea when and where he gets a problem?

87
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:29,895
Why would they kill me, you dirty lady?

88
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:32,860
I just dreamt and
reason has not showed up.

89
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:21,059
I smoked a cigar in childhood
without dad getting to know.

90
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:23,602
My dad came to know,
but dad did not scold.

91
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:26,434
He asked whether I like the cigar.

92
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:31,017
He called me and took me into a room.
The room was full of cigar bundles.

93
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:35,396
He asked me to finish
all those by morning.

94
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:38,017
Saying so he left latching
the door from outside.

95
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:39,017
That is...

96
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:41,141
Kantham...

97
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:44,725
Get up, I will show you a scene. Come on,
what scenes in the midnight hubby?

98
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:46,225
Rajinikanth scene, get up.

99
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:52,016
I smoked one by one cigars whole night.
I did so and finished them all.

100
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:57,432
In the morning by the time I opened doors
and came out I hated the smell of cigars.

101
00:12:58,308 --> 00:13:03,225
I got hatred on cigars. The cigar I then
left, have not touched again till now.

102
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:05,974
Sons here are crazy about fights.

103
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:11,140
If we too leave him at a place of fights,
he would quit getting into fights.

104
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,277
Are you mad?

105
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:15,932
He is rising so even when we are here.
Why do you say send him elsewhere?

106
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,972
No dad to settle if a fight takes place

107
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:26,567
and no mom to pacify
applying butter when he gets

108
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:30,723
When a crying kid is placed amongst
the crying kids, he stops crying.

109
00:13:30,928 --> 00:13:32,639
Where would such a place be hubby?

110
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:37,138
Tirupuram, it is in Andhra
and Tamilnadu border.

111
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:41,086
When Andhra separated
in 1953 from Tamilnadu,

112
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:43,556
that line of division passed
from the mid of Tirupuram.

113
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:46,309
From then Telugu people reside
on one side of the line

114
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,680
and Tamil on the other side.

115
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:50,662
They should not pass over the line.

116
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:54,222
They made a fence, made traditions
and are fighting with each other.

117
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:23,548
Fence and traditions
are built for this village

118
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:25,845
with a thought that
you would be alive if not together.

119
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:27,470
But you are fighting and dying.

120
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,511
What Kesava, it seems you cut
the leg of that area person?

121
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:38,385
What is this elder man,
fight every day and again a assembly?

122
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:44,261
These fence and traditions are not for
people to pass from here to there right?

123
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,144
When we stuck to your word,

124
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:51,010
person from there secretly came here
and tried to kill our guy.

125
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,844
Huh, how would the youngsters
in anger be in control?

126
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,968
They cut the leg and called me.

127
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:01,778
You idiots, you instigated him and
made to come there and then cut his leg.

128
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:03,093
Are you changing the words now?

129
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:04,635
You liars!

130
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,385
Stop it guys, stop it.

131
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:11,788
See your end.

132
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:15,801
Hey Veeramuthu,
is this how you speak in the assembly?

133
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:19,130
Being wealthy does not make
someone respected

134
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,134
but should have a goal that
village should be good.

135
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:26,657
You could not see to that
your people do not cross over,

136
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:28,685
but now your voice is
raising to scream like this.

137
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:33,692
Lost lives, ruined families...
Enough now,

138
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:38,776
I am saying for the last time
to both of you.

139
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,229
Either you have the fear or be careful

140
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:47,566
but none should cross over
from either sides.

141
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:49,380
If you deny and cross over,

142
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,358
your life is not the responsibility
of this assembly.

143
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,440
Sir...
- Give in his house.

144
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:00,441
Ok sir.

145
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,399
Even a dog has the anger
but one should have the sense.

146
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:09,899
Go away.

147
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:18,274
What is this brother? They cut leg of
our guy and insulted us again.

148
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:20,982
We just stood still watching
and could not do anything.

149
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,648
We too should cut the leg of their fellow.

150
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:29,734
Days to say an eye for eye
and life for a life, Bala.

151
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:33,564
Head of them for the leg of our guy.

152
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:37,273
Who would come this side
after so much has happened now?

153
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:40,630
Guard at the border and make
somebody cross over

154
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,064
and then I will take care.

155
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:46,981
Tirupuram.

156
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:50,817
There is an Engineering college,
anybody Telugu or Tamil can study there.

157
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:53,772
Village head has kept a rule that no
fights should take place in the college.

158
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,480
as future of students should not get
spoilt because of fights from the village.

159
00:16:57,688 --> 00:17:02,272
We send him there, he would be
amongst the fights and also safe.

160
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,552
He does not know Tamil right?

161
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:06,147
All would speak Telugu there, dear.
- Uncle, ticket ready.

162
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:08,188
No idea whether food is good or not there.

163
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:11,897
They are fixed,
say something and convince him.

164
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,450
Some people against to me got me
transferred to Tirupuram, son.

165
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,657
But there is still two months time
for the posting.

166
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:20,574
Your semester will start, right?

167
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:23,865
Thus I got you transferred to
Engineering College there.

168
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:27,456
You go and settle there.
We will come there in two months.

169
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:30,288
Dad, do you know
where are you telling this matter?

170
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:35,330
When you said pack the clothes
and we are going to the bus stand,

171
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:38,496
I thought we were going to some place.
Are you pushing me away from here dad?

172
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:40,830
You think I cannot live without you?

173
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:44,871
Dad, if you push me into the sea,
I am a type to somehow achieve.

174
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:46,663
Did you understand, I can live anywhere.

175
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:47,955
Hey son.

176
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:50,870
You do not worry mom,
I am talking right? Dad.

177
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:54,704
Son, if you keep talking
so I fear the bus may leave.

178
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:04,234
Bye.

179
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:08,894
Take care of mom.
- Okay.

180
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:11,282
He might change his mind.
Let's go.

181
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,952
Tirupuram... Tirupuram.
This is it, get down sir.

182
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:55,159
Bro, what are those fields
and what are those hills around?

183
00:18:55,572 --> 00:18:57,493
Have you brought me
to the next state as I slept?

184
00:18:57,573 --> 00:19:00,367
You are in this state only sir.
- Yes, right.

185
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:04,367
Those fields are in the next state.
- Oh, what?

186
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,975
Yes sir, this is the Andhra
and Tamilnadu border.

187
00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:08,742
Andhra this side
and that side is Tamilnadu.

188
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,616
Has my dad put my life so in the border?

189
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:18,658
Sir, you should go this way. If
you go that way, no returning back again.

190
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:21,453
Dad, I got down.

191
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:24,056
What a great change came in you
going to that place, my son?

192
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:25,533
You are calling once you got down.

193
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:27,032
Do not talk crazy dad.

194
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:28,908
Growing up in that pollution from birth,

195
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:32,240
if you suddenly put me into such
a peaceful atmosphere, do I not go crazy?

196
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:35,574
See Hyderabad,
name itself resembles hitting.

197
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:39,865
Tirupuram it seems,
sounding is so worst.

198
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:43,657
You said dad river, a bath
and not to come back unless I plead.

199
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:46,699
Give me one more idli dear. Son is
not here and I will have even his share.

200
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,993
Go on and eat.

201
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:49,574
Hey, will you have food?

202
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:51,281
What, I hate fruits.

203
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:54,032
Not fruits but food, breakfast.

204
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:56,739
What is famous here?
- Here Sambar and idli is famous.

205
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:58,532
Oh, one minute.

206
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:02,239
Dad, cooking of mom is worst.

207
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:05,739
It seems sambar and Idli is famous here,
will enjoy eating and then call you.

208
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,113
Ok, move on. One minute...
Selfie.

209
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:10,148
Smile please...

210
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:32,779
He is come, he is come.

211
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:36,237
Who buys if she says a hundred rupees?
Crazy girl!

212
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,654
Ok, what is this fencing
around the village?

213
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:45,154
This is the hotel.
- Ok, we will eat and then talk. Come on.

214
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:49,029
Bro, two plate idli.

215
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:08,111
Hey, see your hotel has got
so many customers once I stepped in.

216
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,236
Ok, give me two plate idli.
Give it fast.

217
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:17,591
You country fruit,
should cut lemon with a knife.

218
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:19,194
See you tried with such a big sword.

219
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,777
and see how the lemon is stuck?
Worst fellow.

220
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,649
How many time s should I say you?
Do you not understand Telugu?

221
00:21:42,764 --> 00:21:45,526
You do not know about me, I will say.

222
00:21:52,452 --> 00:21:53,983
Hey, are you humans or man eaters?

223
00:21:57,361 --> 00:21:58,483
Why are you like that guys?

224
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:01,026
Hey, I too encourage fights.

225
00:22:01,663 --> 00:22:05,317
But it looks cheap if one kills
each other for sambar and idli.

226
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,599
If you give me my bag back...

227
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:20,775
Hey, stop!

228
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:27,066
Hey grandpa, see they are like to kill me.

229
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:29,357
You too...

230
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:46,526
Come on, jump.

231
00:23:06,814 --> 00:23:09,689
Take water sir, take and drink.

232
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:15,211
Like total family is behind
when the chicken to cut is escaped,

233
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:16,508
why are they all chasing me bro?

234
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:19,205
Day before when their person
came we cut his leg sir.

235
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:20,354
They are in that anger.

236
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,189
Have you cut the leg? Are you any mad?

237
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,066
Not mad sir, but revenge.

238
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:26,355
Telugu guy should not go that way
and the Tamil should not come this way.

239
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,813
Where should you go sir?
- KGN college.

240
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:32,646
You are very lucky sir.

241
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:35,523
You are the only one out with
all parts after crossing over that side

242
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:37,313
and being back again
in the history of Tirupuram.

243
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:39,077
Police come even for
a small fight in Hyderabad.

244
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:40,728
You have been killing
and do they not care?

245
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:43,187
Village head here is very powerful sir.

246
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:46,405
Whatever big maybe the fight happening
here, no way that we go to Police station.

247
00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:48,395
There is no Police station
at all in this village.

248
00:23:48,712 --> 00:23:50,812
Whatever big maybe the settlement,
it happens at the village assembly.

249
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:52,728
It is very interesting.

250
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,062
What exactly is the fight
in this village, bro?

251
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,502
Hey, you have come to study
and go after your studies.

252
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,437
Do not mess with the fights
in this village.

253
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:01,061
Ok, what about the fights in our College?

254
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:03,811
Fights in the College? No chance at all,

255
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:06,394
Principal Paramatma is very strict.

256
00:24:06,718 --> 00:24:09,352
He does not like fights
and does not bother about regions.

257
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:39,289
Telugu or Tamil is
just outside the college.

258
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:42,435
All should be the same once
they step inside the College.

259
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:44,301
They should be as he likes.

260
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:48,434
Anyone to study in the college should stay
in the hostel and should be together.

261
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,642
First see whether he is something wrong.

262
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:54,295
Rekha, Those two are fighting,
suspend them for a week.

263
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,012
Yes sir.

264
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:56,396
Sir, we have given hi five.

265
00:24:56,557 --> 00:24:59,142
I do not know all that.
You hit his hand with your hand.

266
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:01,307
That means you both fought.
Get out of my compound.

267
00:25:01,454 --> 00:25:02,475
Come on Rekha.

268
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:05,433
Bro, I watched Basha film
yesterday night in TV.

269
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:09,412
Whatever but he could not carry the
ease in Tamil like done in Telugu.

270
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:11,882
Whatever but Rajinikanth sir
likes Telugu a bit more.

271
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:12,766
Correct.

272
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:16,016
Listening to your words even Rajinikanth
may get a regional feeling.

273
00:25:16,184 --> 00:25:21,042
Rekha, not for one week but debar these
for a month not to be seen in this radius.

274
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,474
I would have covered with a blanket
and hit if such a guy was in Hyderabad.

275
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:28,598
Huh, for people like you he opens
the doors in midnight and sleeps.

276
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:43,140
Battalion four, enemy is in the front One
theft, one enemy... Fire... Fire... Firr.

277
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,389
That means,
no fights take place in our college.

278
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:50,897
What boss,
have you come to study in the college.

279
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:53,264
or to have fights and tear your clothes?

280
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:56,306
Say bro.
- You look not to listen.

281
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,456
They happen once every month
in the shed of that black Seenu.

282
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:03,138
Black Seenu, who is he?
- Canteen owner of this college.

283
00:26:05,305 --> 00:26:07,531
He takes money and unofficially
organizes fights between.

284
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:10,263
Telugu and Tamil batches
in the shed behind the College.

285
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,763
The guy winning lives like
a king for the whole month.

286
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:22,470
The guy losing moves with head down
for the whole month before him.

287
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,554
Come on guys.

288
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:49,886
Hit now guys.

289
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:55,136
Today is the first right sir?
There will be a fight today.

290
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:57,886
Then, take me there bro.
- I expected.

291
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:17,968
Look sir, you anyways looks
like messing up with the whole College.

292
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:20,552
Here is my card,
call me if you have any need.

293
00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:32,259
Look at him guys.

294
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:33,786
Come on.

295
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:50,966
Hey what is this?
He is continuously eating.

296
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:55,800
Hey Pulakesi, you had a load of idlis,
drank a bucket of sambar.

297
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,540
We fed you like a bull
for the bull fight.

298
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,425
How if you are down so for just two hits?

299
00:28:00,505 --> 00:28:04,507
Go and hit.
Let our prestige stand, hit that fellow.

300
00:28:08,124 --> 00:28:09,174
Come on hit...

301
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:16,882
Yes, that is it.

302
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,798
No way that he gets up and hits
and no chance for us to walk in pride.

303
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,090
We will bow our heads and walk before
the Telugu guys even this month.

304
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,506
Brother.
Take those lungis and keep them in.

305
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:35,256
Hey, next time send guys
who are a bit fresh. - Better if gents.

306
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:54,492
What do you want, puff or cool drink?

307
00:28:54,668 --> 00:28:56,755
I need participation in the game.
- It costs 500.

308
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:00,963
Sit, come on sit.
Our participant has come to fight.

309
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,087
Give that bag here, give it.

310
00:29:05,462 --> 00:29:07,523
Hey, who is this fellow
looking fairer than me?

311
00:29:07,603 --> 00:29:08,629
Hit him two shots extra.

312
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:19,046
Wow... they all are nice to see...

313
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:22,566
This is the first time playing
in this pitch bro.

314
00:29:22,646 --> 00:29:24,049
I have no confidence that I would hit.

315
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,171
I will have at least four shots and go.
Come on...

316
00:29:36,547 --> 00:29:39,670
Oh my god.

317
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:44,170
Shot.

318
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:45,544
Shot.

319
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,968
Wow.

320
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:10,145
Yeah!

321
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,365
You enjoy only when he hits
or you enjoy even when I hit?

322
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:17,044
She is happy whoever hits.

323
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,000
Hey dude, someone is hitting there.

324
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:39,758
That is the reason why I came here.

325
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,708
Hey, he is hitting his guy.
- What are you talking?

326
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,639
Hey, he will leave if you delay like this.

327
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:45,916
Move on...
- Move.

328
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:07,956
Come on hit...
- Babji, who would that be?

329
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:08,946
You crazy idiot!

330
00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:12,290
Hitting his guys like that means,
he would be our guy for sure.

331
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:15,532
Come on.

332
00:31:20,698 --> 00:31:21,706
What is that fellow dude?

333
00:31:37,873 --> 00:31:39,580
Come on hit.

334
00:34:58,258 --> 00:35:03,945
8, 9,10, 11... Hey, who are you man?

335
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:06,487
Hey you... Who are you man?

336
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:07,365
New joining dude.

337
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:10,695
Oh I see, then you should not be here
but in the Principal room.

338
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:17,779
Ok, you came from the city.
All study well there, right?

339
00:35:18,694 --> 00:35:20,404
Then why did you leave there
and come here?

340
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:24,611
Even problem is that sir. All
study well there and I have no company.

341
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:26,570
But here, these will not study
and I too will not study.

342
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:28,903
We will live together sir.

343
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:32,778
You go and join in the hostel.
- Ok sir.

344
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:37,236
Keep this fellow under observation.
- I am already on the same job sir.

345
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:45,704
Bro, this is our hostel. Our Principal
says all studying came up in life.

346
00:35:45,784 --> 00:35:48,818
Of course, he stayed back right here.
- Dude, you come into my room.

347
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:52,360
Hey, what to be in your room?
No us except for eating.

348
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:54,667
Bro you cannot be anywhere.

349
00:35:54,747 --> 00:35:57,360
You should be here.
You should be in my room, come on.

350
00:35:57,443 --> 00:35:58,347
Ok.

351
00:36:00,206 --> 00:36:02,193
Come on bro...
- This fellow then?

352
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:05,859
Should wake up in the morning
and take bath like ever, oh no.

353
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:08,837
He should be down stairs
and you should be up.

354
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,193
Anyone to touch us should fear.

355
00:36:12,278 --> 00:36:15,569
We found out who that guy is,
it seems he came new to our college.

356
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:20,069
Auto Bose said though he went that side
unknowingly has escaped cleverly.

357
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:22,028
Ok, go.

358
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:24,102
Okay, sir.

359
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:25,486
What crops should we harvest sir?

360
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,777
What all have they harvested?
- Maize sir.

361
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:31,986
We should be no less to them,
you too harvest the maize.

362
00:36:32,154 --> 00:36:33,777
Ok sir.

363
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:42,944
He is made so many run means,
he should be in observation.

364
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:52,110
Good evening sir.
- Good evening.

365
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:55,401
I will study sir.
- Good boy.

366
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,484
What bro, why is the total hostel silent?
Will none ever fight?

367
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:22,124
CC cameras are fixed everywhere except
in rooms and bathrooms.

368
00:37:22,204 --> 00:37:25,649
That is why we go to that
shed once a month and fight.

369
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:29,274
Should I wait a month more to fight?

370
00:37:29,983 --> 00:37:32,441
Hey dude, find out
whether he is our guy or not.
<b><font color="#ff0000"><i>MAZE HDRelease</i></font></b>

371
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:40,350
Bro, who is your favorite hero?
- Rajinikanth bro, I saw Robo 10 times.

372
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:46,385
He is saying favorite hero is
Rajinikanth, idiot. Why doubts again?

373
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:53,190
Hey dude, he is speaking
Telugu fluently. Ask that, ask.

374
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:55,656
What is this dude?
- Ask.

375
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,648
Bro, you are speaking Telugu very clean.
- I know four languages bro.

376
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:02,188
Oh, hey come here.

377
00:38:02,268 --> 00:38:04,902
He knows four languages it seems.
You are killing me.

378
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,689
Something feels wrong...

379
00:38:07,647 --> 00:38:12,147
Not that dude.
- Leave it and say yes... You said great.

380
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:14,288
Are you from Andhra?

381
00:38:14,368 --> 00:38:16,772
What is your nuisance, idiots? I am
not from Andhra, so should I not be here?

382
00:38:16,856 --> 00:38:18,456
You wait man,

383
00:38:18,536 --> 00:38:22,230
we lost all these days in fight
to them and lived bowing our heads.

384
00:38:22,703 --> 00:38:25,480
We have heard when they insulted.

385
00:38:26,147 --> 00:38:29,401
Leave that, we just knew that girls
in this college have feet

386
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:31,230
but forgot that they have the face too.

387
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,093
And now after so long,

388
00:38:33,173 --> 00:38:35,730
we got the chance to lift
our heads because of you.

389
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:38,355
From tomorrow...

390
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:13,686
Game has started dude.

391
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:20,721
Bro just coming...

392
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:23,891
Hey, it is been very long since
I lifted my collar

393
00:39:23,972 --> 00:39:25,811
and saw girls in our college.

394
00:39:25,978 --> 00:39:30,852
No Telugu or Tamil,
just enough that it is a girl, attack.

395
00:39:33,477 --> 00:39:36,054
Bro...seniors for me...
and juniors for you ok? - Ok move...

396
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,477
Hey Rozy,
why do you not be friends with me?

397
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:44,397
When there are so many in the college,
why friendship only with me?

398
00:39:44,477 --> 00:39:46,241
Why would the cute looking be
friends to me?

399
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:49,877
You idiot.
- Principal is not here, right?

400
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:59,809
You are so hot baby. - I am on 102 fever.
Why will I not be hot?

401
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,508
Hey Suzi, shall we both get married?

402
00:40:04,588 --> 00:40:07,141
Idiot you are in third year
and I am in fourth year.

403
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,304
Then marry me next year,
even I will be in fourth year then right?

404
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:18,464
What happened dud?
- Suzi is clapped dude.

405
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:20,516
So...
- By mistake, my face went in between.

406
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:23,224
Damn, you.

407
00:40:24,014 --> 00:40:24,808
Yes right?

408
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:28,432
Hi... Hi this is...
- What is the percentage?

409
00:40:28,724 --> 00:40:30,266
Percentage.

410
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,265
How many are the backlogs?

411
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,432
I am asking you,
how many are the backlogs?

412
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,099
Three.

413
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,932
Though your mouth says a lie,
hand is saying the truth.

414
00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:40,595
Which class?

415
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,140
Third year CSE.

416
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:45,974
Oh, my class!
You know how far did the syllabus finish?

417
00:40:46,495 --> 00:40:50,056
You know how far have the labs come till?
Do you know which class is it now?

418
00:40:50,278 --> 00:40:51,889
Do you at least know
where the class room is?

419
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:56,597
Then what do you know?
Is it only to say hi to a girl?

420
00:40:58,181 --> 00:40:59,611
Go to the class.
- This way?

421
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:00,785
Yes, go.

422
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:03,389
Yes, that Srinu guy... Bring him once.
- What happened?

423
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:06,233
Good morning.

424
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:12,138
Wow! You get up great idiots,

425
00:41:12,607 --> 00:41:17,055
come on sit you uneducated
Engineering fellows.

426
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:22,263
Last semester topper Karthika...
Give her a big hand...

427
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:24,084
Stop it!

428
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,931
Why are you shouting so confidently dear?

429
00:41:28,097 --> 00:41:31,430
You failed in four subjects.
Just pass in two.

430
00:41:32,017 --> 00:41:36,471
There are still 16 subjects
balance in the backlog. How dare you?

431
00:41:36,669 --> 00:41:38,346
You said Karthika right sir?

432
00:41:38,637 --> 00:41:41,929
I called M. Karthika
and you are L. Karthika, sit down.

433
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,887
M. Karthika, give her a big hand

434
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,142
Sixteen?

435
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:52,552
Mine can be shown with the hands.

436
00:41:52,632 --> 00:41:54,386
You will have to raise
even your legs to show yours.

437
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:55,761
Just shut up, ok?

438
00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:59,803
Oh no, English! Talk once...
Gave a great build up, you idiot.

439
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:08,636
Hey, who is that fellow?
Looks like may die laughing.

440
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,722
New guy named Hari, Sir.

441
00:42:10,802 --> 00:42:11,845
Hey, stand up. It does not look nice.

442
00:42:12,885 --> 00:42:14,295
Have you come on transfer?

443
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:15,552
No sir, I came by bus.

444
00:42:17,437 --> 00:42:20,094
What? Worst joke idiot,
very worst joke.

445
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:23,135
When the whole class is silent,
why this sarcasm for you?

446
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:23,927
Sorry sir.

447
00:42:24,052 --> 00:42:26,427
What is your percentage, man?
- Ninety one sir.

448
00:42:28,427 --> 00:42:29,888
Ninety one?
- Yes sir.

449
00:42:29,968 --> 00:42:33,228
Internal test or semester test?
- Drink and drive test sir.

450
00:42:37,634 --> 00:42:40,156
Why do you laugh so for the rotten jokes?
You idiot.

451
00:42:40,236 --> 00:42:41,371
Sorry again sir.

452
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:45,752
Hey, I have many doubts on your standards.

453
00:42:45,832 --> 00:42:48,361
I will ask you a simple question.
Give answer to that.

454
00:42:48,551 --> 00:42:49,592
Ok sir.

455
00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:53,138
What is CSE?
Say the full form of it.

456
00:42:53,218 --> 00:42:53,966
Look in the Google.

457
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:06,132
Computer...

458
00:43:07,422 --> 00:43:09,425
Oh wow.

459
00:43:10,682 --> 00:43:11,507
Scanner.

460
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:16,966
E for... E for...

461
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:18,011
Education?

462
00:43:18,091 --> 00:43:20,299
Yes, the same sir. Education

463
00:43:22,173 --> 00:43:27,507
I thought... you came new
and may not mix up them.

464
00:43:28,424 --> 00:43:33,882
Great sync, mix up like milk
and water, and die happily.

465
00:43:34,251 --> 00:43:35,715
Sir, will you not say us the lessons?

466
00:43:36,423 --> 00:43:38,923
What happens if I come in between PG?
- PIG.

467
00:43:39,757 --> 00:43:41,381
I would also become PG lecturer right?

468
00:43:42,477 --> 00:43:43,881
Oh no, it did not strike for me sir.

469
00:43:43,965 --> 00:43:46,589
How can I teach lessons
to dumb heads like you?

470
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:52,602
I used to once answer
any questions immediately,

471
00:43:52,682 --> 00:43:56,464
but now am unable to answer
even simple questions.

472
00:43:56,544 --> 00:43:59,753
You brought down my levels to that stage,
idiots.

473
00:44:02,775 --> 00:44:05,300
Karthika.
- Looks like he is come till the hostel.

474
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,632
Karthika, stop...

475
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:08,839
What?

476
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:11,421
I felt tensed thinking you are a topper.

477
00:44:11,713 --> 00:44:13,714
I mean, we cannot talk well
to the studious right?

478
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:15,588
And with you,
I can talk very freely now.

479
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:17,586
What will you talk?

480
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:23,296
You and I have similarities Karthika.
You like fights and I too like fights.

481
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:28,629
You are weak in studies and I too am.
Of course very much better than you.

482
00:44:28,926 --> 00:44:29,970
Get away.

483
00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:36,061
That is why I am saying to hold the hand
of someone better than you,

484
00:45:17,288 --> 00:45:18,287
Mom...

485
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:22,543
How are you son?
Are you applying cream to the wounds?

486
00:45:22,913 --> 00:45:26,501
Wound this time is not on body mom,
but to the heart,

487
00:45:26,669 --> 00:45:27,668
What happened son?

488
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:30,043
I saw a girl here mom.

489
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:33,542
Though she looks homely like you for
seeing, is a rebel from inside like me.

490
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:39,293
Innocence, arrogance, craziness... Think
she is a cocktail mix of all qualities,

491
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:42,834
Hubby, it seems he liked some girl.
- What?

492
00:45:43,688 --> 00:45:46,754
Though his comparison is horrible,
he is trying to describe,

493
00:45:46,834 --> 00:45:49,140
Perfect diversion is come for his mind.

494
00:45:49,221 --> 00:45:52,084
We should encourage full
and turn this hunter into a sage,

495
00:45:53,624 --> 00:45:55,042
Have you said that girl, son?

496
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,041
I do not understand how to say dad,

497
00:45:57,208 --> 00:46:02,219
Watch good love movies, read books
on love, put all your feelings on paper.

498
00:46:02,485 --> 00:46:06,581
That girl should feel worried thinking
what would happen to her life,

499
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:07,749
without this guy,

500
00:46:08,154 --> 00:46:09,248
You smashed it up dad.

501
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:12,635
Stop the e violent words first
and behave cute, son.

502
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:17,457
I love you.

503
00:46:21,097 --> 00:46:24,332
Hello I love you... Bye.

504
00:46:24,624 --> 00:46:27,363
Why are you staring at me in the class?
- What is me looking at you? I did not see.

505
00:46:27,443 --> 00:46:30,207
I saw you seeing.
- What? Why did you see?

506
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:32,374
I saw to know why you were seeing me.

507
00:46:32,454 --> 00:46:33,876
I too the same, I saw to confirm
whether you are seeing or not.

508
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:35,082
Hey, do not change the topic.

509
00:46:35,582 --> 00:46:38,137
Hey dude, it is confirmed that
he is a Telugu guy.

510
00:46:38,217 --> 00:46:39,747
He is completely
watching Telugu movies, see.

511
00:46:39,872 --> 00:46:41,899
We watch English movies
and do we become English guys?

512
00:46:47,706 --> 00:46:50,706
Hey bro, he is a Telugu guy.
He is reading Telugu book.

513
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:56,084
I am doing mathematics and
do I become a Mathematician? - Not that.

514
00:46:56,164 --> 00:46:58,455
You crazy fellow, stick it
and give the book to Rozy.

515
00:47:19,582 --> 00:47:21,121
Why are there so many
and why is he throwing so?

516
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,689
Hey dude, see he wrote in Telugu.

517
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,119
See how angry is he on Telugu.
He is writing and again cutting it off.

518
00:47:34,328 --> 00:47:35,704
He is surely a Tamil guy.

519
00:47:35,784 --> 00:47:36,595
Cheers.

520
00:47:36,675 --> 00:47:39,184
Cheers.
- Cheers.

521
00:47:40,244 --> 00:47:43,369
Hey, it seems city girl
wear clothes only this length.

522
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:46,745
Boys here are still not updated.

523
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:49,244
They are seeing us even
when we are wearing this length.

524
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:54,493
Hey Karthika,
A letter for you.

525
00:47:55,618 --> 00:47:59,577
Huh, how many would write,
am I the only girl in the college?

526
00:48:00,006 --> 00:48:04,785
Why not write to her? Why not to her?
Who is it now?

527
00:48:05,145 --> 00:48:06,119
Hari it seems.

528
00:48:09,035 --> 00:48:10,156
I expected,

529
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:13,895
I expected a letter would come
from this fellow.

530
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:16,577
It is delayed by two days, read it.

531
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,398
Hi... You are reading the letter written
by very cute, smart,

532
00:48:20,478 --> 00:48:25,326
intelligent and daring Hari.

533
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:35,366
Leave it dude, not this letter.
Why this torture to you every week?

534
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,034
Leave it dear, this is very interesting.
You read it.

535
00:48:38,326 --> 00:48:41,781
Never believe if someone says you are
a beautiful girl, clever,

536
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:44,328
ten go flat when you see.

537
00:48:44,408 --> 00:48:46,992
Because a fool should be made
only on April fool,

538
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:49,950
but they are making you
a fool throughout the year.

539
00:48:51,267 --> 00:48:52,700
Say what your plus points are...

540
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,036
Colour.

541
00:48:54,116 --> 00:48:55,365
Even a wall has it.

542
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:58,325
Eyes.
- Why spectacles if they are good?

543
00:48:58,408 --> 00:49:01,866
Beauty - If yours is a beauty,
what should it be for Aishwarya Rai?

544
00:49:02,882 --> 00:49:07,699
So, to openly say you too
are just ok like your marks.

545
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:11,220
They say it selfishness loving
someone with all qualities.

546
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,782
That is why I selected you...

547
00:49:14,964 --> 00:49:22,449
Waiting for your response... thirsty
for your love... struck it... devil.

548
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,489
Con... struck it off...

549
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:29,647
Huh, come on let us teach him a lesson.

550
00:49:34,602 --> 00:49:39,739
Hey wait, they are a hundred eager guys
and we are hardly ten.

551
00:49:40,098 --> 00:49:41,363
Maybe they would trouble us,

552
00:49:41,613 --> 00:49:43,103
is it required now?
- Hey, move on.

553
00:49:45,704 --> 00:49:46,895
Come on, come.

554
00:49:56,487 --> 00:49:58,988
There are CC cameras here.

555
00:50:00,113 --> 00:50:01,909
No use with CC cameras here,

556
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:04,197
but fuse should be
there is the room of Principal.

557
00:50:04,821 --> 00:50:07,529
When did you pick it up?
- Details later, move first.

558
00:50:11,112 --> 00:50:12,312
Too much holes for this...

559
00:50:16,251 --> 00:50:19,515
Oh no, all get wealth
and property from grandparents

560
00:50:19,595 --> 00:50:21,945
and why did this fellow get
an underwear?

561
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:27,195
Girls, when would I move with girls bro?
Believe me.

562
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:29,341
Come, come, come.

563
00:50:34,828 --> 00:50:35,854
Yuck!

564
00:50:36,028 --> 00:50:39,778
No, what is this? That fellow is taking
care of torn underwear like the gold.

565
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:43,445
This fellow has left what to cover
and covered what to leave. Bad fate!

566
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:46,809
Hey, what is his roll number?
- 108.

567
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:51,059
This one.

568
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,454
Close the door and switch on the light.

569
00:51:02,534 --> 00:51:03,708
Get up Adi.

570
00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:09,069
Hey, what is this? You had come last night
and why again you? Go and send Padma.

571
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,998
Why is this fellow saying
I came in the night

572
00:51:13,078 --> 00:51:14,363
and asking now send another girl?

573
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:20,109
Do I look like a broker to him?
Idiot, get up idiot.

574
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:23,413
Hey, I thought would get a response
and you came directly.

575
00:51:23,493 --> 00:51:24,821
Your cheek will be blasted.

576
00:51:24,901 --> 00:51:27,025
Oh height... weight...

577
00:51:27,105 --> 00:51:28,192
Can I help you?
- Remove your hand.

578
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:34,635
What are you thinking about me?

579
00:51:34,715 --> 00:51:39,775
As I look calm wearing specs and soft,
you think can try for me?

580
00:51:39,983 --> 00:51:44,108
You know about me?
Do you know my originality?

581
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:47,441
I drink liquor,
I hit people if I go angry.

582
00:51:48,308 --> 00:51:51,149
I hit so many when small.

583
00:51:51,431 --> 00:51:55,941
I am covering my character putting
the violence aside after I became young.

584
00:51:56,424 --> 00:51:59,190
Do not mess with me unnecessarily
and bring out my originality.

585
00:52:00,253 --> 00:52:02,315
Say, what have I done coming
into your dreams in the night?

586
00:52:02,689 --> 00:52:05,941
You took away my three sweets.
- What sweets?

587
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:09,315
I will kill if you mess with me again.

588
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:10,804
Go.

589
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,608
Let's go.

590
00:55:14,098 --> 00:55:18,556
Stop it, I have exams from tomorrow.
I should work hard, do not disturb me.

591
00:55:18,953 --> 00:55:20,143
What's wrong?

592
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:22,956
Pack up.

593
00:55:51,872 --> 00:55:53,331
Rekha.
- Sir.

594
00:55:53,411 --> 00:55:55,205
Is she not exactly like
Goddess Saraswathi?

595
00:55:57,914 --> 00:55:59,913
Poor girl, should have been good
if she had even education.

596
00:56:03,038 --> 00:56:04,997
Did she sleep studying hard?
She has not come still.

597
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:19,329
Madam, excuse me.

598
00:56:19,974 --> 00:56:22,384
You were not seen yesterday,
have you been to film with your hubby?

599
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:23,437
Yes.

600
00:56:24,591 --> 00:56:27,036
Hey, why are you here?
Your roll number is there, right?

601
00:56:28,723 --> 00:56:31,831
I wanted to copy from you
and become University topper.

602
00:56:31,911 --> 00:56:35,786
Do not act crazy and go sit in your seat.
If not I will complain to Sir.

603
00:56:37,213 --> 00:56:40,056
Hello, you sit in your seat
and you write your exam.

604
00:56:40,136 --> 00:56:41,495
You get your gold medal.

605
00:56:41,995 --> 00:56:44,890
Sir...
- Hey, no need. I will go.

606
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:45,953
Go.

607
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:07,409
Oh no, you took total text book
xeroxed on your dress?

608
00:57:12,951 --> 00:57:13,994
You said to work hard.

609
00:57:27,825 --> 00:57:28,829
and you did this?

610
00:57:28,909 --> 00:57:31,783
Please, I beg you.

611
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:35,547
My dad would hit me with belt
if I do not pass this time.

612
00:57:35,627 --> 00:57:38,492
I will do whatever you want, please.

613
00:57:38,971 --> 00:57:41,575
Wait outside after the exam.
I will come and give a hug.

614
00:57:41,864 --> 00:57:42,950
You...

615
00:57:43,905 --> 00:57:49,158
Shall I say? Sir.
- Oh no, I am not habituated to such.

616
00:57:50,703 --> 00:57:53,526
Did you have such habits to write
on the dress from birth?

617
00:57:53,606 --> 00:57:55,408
Write the exam first.

618
00:57:56,949 --> 00:57:59,867
You have seen Khaidi Number 150, right?
Did you like it? - Yes.

619
00:58:00,074 --> 00:58:03,491
Next film is coming now,
Saira Narasimhareddy,

620
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:06,953
that would be more super.
I know the story, a real story.

621
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:10,949
The guy behind me has put slips sir.
- Oh no.

622
00:58:15,646 --> 00:58:22,156
You kept such a big slip idiot.
You kept it, but you should write, right?

623
00:58:22,323 --> 00:58:24,073
Why are you looking
in the air instead of writing?

624
00:58:24,156 --> 00:58:28,031
I have the answer, but not understanding
to write for which question in this sir.

625
00:58:39,114 --> 00:58:40,216
What is your nonsense?

626
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:43,405
Thanks dear, I saved the number
in mind instead of my cell phone.

627
00:58:45,471 --> 00:58:48,341
Hey Karthika, do not cut.
Ten minutes, this is my life matter.

628
00:58:48,421 --> 00:58:49,029
Say.

629
00:58:49,154 --> 00:58:51,489
If you just give ten minutes time,
we shall clearly talk.

630
00:58:51,572 --> 00:58:53,404
At ten in the library.

631
00:58:54,238 --> 00:58:56,888
Oh no, just ten minutes left
and I am starting immediately.

632
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:59,363
Wait, wait... Tomorrow morning.

633
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,404
Full waiting.

634
00:59:03,863 --> 00:59:05,904
When do I write so many slips again?

635
00:59:35,069 --> 00:59:36,377
Just ten minutes time,

636
00:59:36,457 --> 00:59:38,819
if you say what the matter is,
I will listen and leave.

637
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,362
What, shall I say to your back?

638
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:45,763
Say.

639
00:59:46,715 --> 00:59:48,236
Karthika...

640
00:59:56,177 --> 00:59:59,125
Your eyes are disturbing me very much.
Will you please turn that side, please?

641
01:00:03,526 --> 01:00:05,511
My life style before was
different Karthika.

642
01:00:05,591 --> 01:00:07,068
Always a fight and
Police station every day.

643
01:00:07,322 --> 01:00:09,386
When my dad used to scold me saying
none like me would be on this earth,

644
01:00:09,466 --> 01:00:10,567
I felt it was true.

645
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,526
But for the first time after seeing you,
I felt like seeing myself.

646
01:00:14,734 --> 01:00:18,193
Somehow, I fully got connected.
What you look from outside is not you,

647
01:00:18,442 --> 01:00:20,011
there is another girl inside you.

648
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:24,234
I liked that girl a lot,
please tell my feelings to her.

649
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:30,899
Go idiot.

650
01:02:01,479 --> 01:02:07,688
Results of the exams written recently
have come. Class topper is Karthika...

651
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,565
Karthika, not you. You are M. Karthika
and L. Karthika came class first.

652
01:02:13,645 --> 01:02:18,187
Me? - Yes you dear, get up.
Give her a big hand.

653
01:02:19,299 --> 01:02:20,478
Thanks.

654
01:02:22,513 --> 01:02:23,677
Where is he?

655
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:28,731
You should keep doing when required
Otherwise, our value will not be known.

656
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:29,728
Hari...

657
01:02:43,811 --> 01:02:52,352
Hey, performance near me?
Like that then and now so, what happened?

658
01:02:52,786 --> 01:02:55,560
Neither you were studious then
nor me then, I felt we would sync.

659
01:02:55,819 --> 01:02:58,560
But you are the class topper now, I
felt you may not talk with people like me.

660
01:02:58,768 --> 01:03:03,309
When you disturbed everywhere for few days
and now suddenly get silent,

661
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:06,809
you think my concentration gets disturbed?
It is not.

662
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:08,385
Ok.

663
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:14,767
What ok?
I am saying no and not disturbed.

664
01:03:16,758 --> 01:03:17,641
Ok.

665
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,386
Oh my God!

666
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:21,732
Go idiot.

667
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,316
I feel to be friendly with my dad,
but cannot be.

668
01:03:31,396 --> 01:03:33,474
I feel like being open at my mom,
but cannot.

669
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,641
I really wanted to be like me
but could not.

670
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,683
But even when I am different, you
are looking at me like what I really am.

671
01:03:39,879 --> 01:03:41,058
I am disturbed for that.

672
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:46,474
It is you identifying that I am not me.
It is you making me identify in you.

673
01:03:46,922 --> 01:03:49,433
How if you go silently
now after doing so much?

674
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:07,223
What did you say? Say again.

675
01:04:07,467 --> 01:04:10,098
It is you identifying that I am not me.

676
01:04:10,348 --> 01:04:12,473
It is you making me identify in you.

677
01:04:12,973 --> 01:04:15,264
How if you go silently now
after doing so much?

678
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:18,930
You got even words
along with marks, come on.

679
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:23,055
For this distance to reduce between us,
impress my dad.

680
01:04:23,552 --> 01:04:24,931
Impossible.
- What?

681
01:04:25,202 --> 01:04:27,888
Your dad not to get impressed
is impossible.

682
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:35,888
I need information.
- I should pay an installment.

683
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,847
Do you have payTM?
- What is that?

684
01:04:41,021 --> 01:04:42,804
I need details of Karthika.
- Just one minute,

685
01:04:45,763 --> 01:04:49,321
it is not as easy to take details
to deal with her, Sir.

686
01:04:49,401 --> 01:04:52,304
She is the daughter of Keshavulu.

687
01:04:52,804 --> 01:04:55,346
He is the elder amongst
all the Telugu people here.

688
01:04:55,426 --> 01:04:59,386
Are you fearing or frightening?
- I am saying to be careful sir.

689
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:05,846
Bro...
- Did you identify?

690
01:05:08,053 --> 01:05:09,970
Have you caught his daughter?

691
01:05:10,459 --> 01:05:13,136
Yes bro, you gave the card and came
thinking you would also give an idea.

692
01:05:13,428 --> 01:05:15,261
How to impress Kesavulu?

693
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:17,178
He sent men to find out about you.

694
01:05:17,303 --> 01:05:18,537
For what?

695
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:22,011
Kesavulu feels very happy even
by saying a word to Veera Muthu.

696
01:05:22,095 --> 01:05:25,010
And as you made his men run around,

697
01:05:25,177 --> 01:05:28,927
he asked to enquire about you. But
will he give his daughter just for that?

698
01:05:30,069 --> 01:05:30,511
Thank you.

699
01:05:30,591 --> 01:05:33,510
Hey, I have still not given an idea.
- I got it.

700
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:41,927
This village has a history
and we have a prestige.

701
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:45,301
You and them have a revenge
and thus are fighting to death.

702
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:48,176
What is this to pull a guy
with no relation, Muthu?

703
01:05:49,134 --> 01:05:52,551
What are you saying old man,
whom did we pull in?

704
01:06:03,365 --> 01:06:06,301
Bro, this is the guy who came
to our side and escaped.

705
01:06:08,092 --> 01:06:10,217
Sir, I came here from Hyderabad to study.

706
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,189
Once I got down from the bus,

707
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:15,477
when the short idiot said breakfast
is good here,

708
01:06:15,557 --> 01:06:16,717
and ordered idli, sambar.

709
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:20,091
By then they came in varieties
of face holding big swords to kill me sir.

710
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,132
My parents would have become orphans
if they had killed me sir.

711
01:06:24,808 --> 01:06:26,467
Who takes responsibility for my life sir?

712
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,887
Oh no, you could not do anything to us

713
01:06:28,967 --> 01:06:31,717
and showing power on that
kid coming from elsewhere?

714
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:35,692
If you fight face to face,
power will be known.

715
01:06:35,772 --> 01:06:37,757
Son in law.
- You wait.

716
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:43,341
Look old man, it is not good to conduct
the assembly as someone said something.

717
01:06:43,591 --> 01:06:46,724
We have not seen
his face till we came here.

718
01:06:46,804 --> 01:06:50,048
Still, the assembly does not need
blames but needs proofs.

719
01:06:50,926 --> 01:06:52,840
You and your old...

720
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,715
Did he take photos with
the kid without seeing, Sir?

721
01:07:04,423 --> 01:07:07,923
What photo?
- He asked a selfie and I obliged brother.

722
01:07:08,933 --> 01:07:14,175
Is he Kamal or Rajini?
- To take a selfie... Hey.

723
01:07:14,943 --> 01:07:16,289
Muthu...

724
01:07:16,563 --> 01:07:18,964
Should I believe
they did all this without your orders?

725
01:07:20,466 --> 01:07:22,620
If I have to run such
an assembly once again,

726
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,254
another guy will be in your place.
Ask for forgiveness.

727
01:07:35,194 --> 01:07:36,504
Forgive me sir.

728
01:07:38,986 --> 01:07:40,796
Hey, come on guys.

729
01:07:45,077 --> 01:07:46,084
Come on guys.

730
01:07:48,754 --> 01:07:52,754
First time my stomach is full
with happiness and not with food.

731
01:07:56,024 --> 01:07:59,981
Come once to my house for food,
I will do a celebration.

732
01:08:06,668 --> 01:08:09,670
Hello... - Miss Karthika,
be ready to become mistress.

733
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:10,756
What?

734
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:14,086
Your dad has got full impression on me. He
invited to come for food when I am free.

735
01:08:14,482 --> 01:08:17,387
Is it? There is a function tomorrow
in my house. Come tomorrow itself.

736
01:08:33,502 --> 01:08:34,876
Where?

737
01:08:36,043 --> 01:08:38,960
Will you eat Biriyani?
- Yes, where?

738
01:08:41,126 --> 01:08:43,156
Why to the house of your
father in law for eating Biriyani?

739
01:08:43,236 --> 01:08:45,171
He is a serious man and would kill.

740
01:08:45,251 --> 01:08:47,259
Hey, father in law likes me very much.

741
01:08:47,339 --> 01:08:48,553
Hey, father in law likes me very much.
He invited me to lunch.

742
01:08:48,633 --> 01:08:50,251
Do you know the house of father in law?

743
01:08:52,584 --> 01:08:54,100
Wow... he built greatly...

744
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:55,354
A little down.

745
01:08:55,601 --> 01:08:57,424
Oh, you brought me even
while asking do you know.

746
01:08:57,504 --> 01:09:01,000
You say, no problem?
- Are you doubting me?

747
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:05,750
Hey fools, what is this chitchat without
doing work? I will complain to uncle/

748
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,069
You are a cute boy, dude.

749
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:09,587
When space of bicycle is provide,
you rush driving a scooter/

750
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:11,624
We came on the bullet, right?
- Move on/

751
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:16,952
Hey, what is that eating?
You are so hefty, bring down your food/

752
01:09:20,249 --> 01:09:22,166
Hey, what sis this whole house made wet?

753
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:26,166
Hey, what are you playing with kids?

754
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:27,832
Take these and tie to the door front.
- Mom...

755
01:09:27,912 --> 01:09:29,499
Mom...
- Tie it.

756
01:09:32,743 --> 01:09:35,373
My name is Padayappa...
It is me everywhere.

757
01:10:03,707 --> 01:10:07,664
Hey, what are you doing?
- B.Tech third year.

758
01:10:09,017 --> 01:10:09,942
Go.

759
01:10:49,798 --> 01:10:50,916
Why is this fellow here?

760
01:10:55,412 --> 01:10:57,370
Who would be in the house of uncle,
instead of him?

761
01:10:57,676 --> 01:10:59,829
He is a Tamil guy right?
- We too are Tamilians, right?

762
01:11:00,278 --> 01:11:02,111
Who said I am a Tamilian?
I am a Telugu guy.

763
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:04,287
Hey, when asked are you
Rajinikanth fan, you said yes.

764
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:06,869
Rajinikanth fans are even
in Japan and am I a Japanese?

765
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:08,863
You said no when asked
are you from Andhra?

766
01:11:08,943 --> 01:11:10,786
Yes Hyderabad,
means Telangana.

767
01:11:11,113 --> 01:11:14,119
Hey, do not joke.
You even fought on our side.

768
01:11:14,244 --> 01:11:16,453
I am interested into fighting
and would fight on the side of anybody.

769
01:11:17,578 --> 01:11:18,809
Hey, are you gone mad?

770
01:11:18,889 --> 01:11:20,869
Did you not understand I am a Tamilian
at least by seeing my colour?

771
01:11:21,369 --> 01:11:22,577
Harsha is more black than you, right?

772
01:11:22,657 --> 01:11:23,847
You have answers for everything.

773
01:11:23,927 --> 01:11:27,327
Oh no, I encouraged when you tried
for our girl thinking you are our guy.

774
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,452
If he gets to know the matter,
he would kill both of us.

775
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:36,660
I called M. Karthika...You are L.
Karthika... Sit down.

776
01:11:37,202 --> 01:11:38,349
Daughter of Kesavulu.

777
01:11:38,429 --> 01:11:41,243
He is the head of all Telugu people
in this village.

778
01:11:47,589 --> 01:11:50,101
Is the name of even
his daughter is Karthika?

779
01:11:50,768 --> 01:11:53,067
We are trapped dude, escape

780
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:08,968
Sir, enemy.

781
01:12:12,741 --> 01:12:14,521
Birthday of grandfather,

782
01:12:14,601 --> 01:12:17,033
not the animal sacrifice
but he is asking for human sacrifice.

783
01:12:17,268 --> 01:12:20,740
separated, chop that fellow.

784
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:24,782
Come on give that...

785
01:12:24,865 --> 01:12:26,784
Hey, They will kill us...
Come on move...

786
01:12:27,902 --> 01:12:29,706
Close the door.

787
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:24,526
Hello.
- Yes, what son? How are you?

788
01:13:25,264 --> 01:13:28,689
For the first time in life dad,
I am feeling home sick.

789
01:13:30,336 --> 01:13:33,547
It seems he is feeling home sick, dear.
He is a changed person.

790
01:13:33,707 --> 01:13:34,662
Oh dear.

791
01:13:42,728 --> 01:13:46,102
Take ladies and kids inside.

792
01:13:49,414 --> 01:13:50,431
Move.

793
01:13:58,602 --> 01:14:01,148
Son in law, why did he come here
even after knowing that

794
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:02,602
he is from the opposite side?

795
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,809
We should know.

796
01:14:05,893 --> 01:14:09,143
He did not come,
I brought him to hand over him to you.

797
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:15,643
I am Tamilian, I am Tamil, I am Tamilian.

798
01:14:17,341 --> 01:14:19,615
Kattappa himself has given
the blow and what am I?

799
01:14:19,695 --> 01:14:23,059
If you know to trap, I know to escape.
Now I am safe.

800
01:14:23,184 --> 01:14:27,309
Brother, what if Tamil?
He scolded me, a girl of your house.

801
01:14:27,765 --> 01:14:28,891
Who is she?

802
01:14:29,202 --> 01:14:31,916
What is that food, you look so hefty?

803
01:14:31,996 --> 01:14:32,892
Reduce eating.
- Come.

804
01:14:33,223 --> 01:14:35,119
Foot in the mouth.

805
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:38,725
Neither him nor this fellow,
do not leave anybody.

806
01:14:51,992 --> 01:14:55,006
Hey, power bill increases this month
in your house if you move.

807
01:14:56,516 --> 01:14:57,766
Shall I keep it in the water?

808
01:15:05,099 --> 01:15:09,973
Hey idiot, the ball is in our court now.
Don't move... Current belt.

809
01:15:14,817 --> 01:15:19,598
What are these? Did they not identify
power is gone in the emotion?

810
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:22,163
What should I do now?

811
01:15:23,822 --> 01:15:27,623
You throw the swords and compromise.
We too will leave silently.

812
01:15:30,014 --> 01:15:32,347
Come on throw. Hello, you too.

813
01:15:37,804 --> 01:15:40,430
It is Grand father's sword
- But not Grand father right?

814
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:46,346
What dude, what is a deal with those?
Not ours, come on put it, put.

815
01:15:46,971 --> 01:15:47,724
You wait dude.

816
01:15:47,804 --> 01:15:51,763
Hey, what to wait? Say, if you cannot
and I will put it. I will put it.

817
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:56,763
Give the bike keys.
- Here...

818
01:15:58,008 --> 01:16:01,304
You will have it idiot.
Put it wherever you want to now, put it.

819
01:16:04,179 --> 01:16:08,888
Yes, say now boys.
What to do, what not to do?

820
01:16:10,703 --> 01:16:11,720
I will put.

821
01:16:14,715 --> 01:16:15,695
I will put.

822
01:16:16,107 --> 01:16:19,137
I will put. Shall I put? I have put.

823
01:16:19,262 --> 01:16:23,114
Power is gone exactly
when I was watching the TV. - No...

824
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:51,593
Should you see again?
Run dude.

825
01:16:53,551 --> 01:16:54,636
Hey, he escaped.

826
01:17:03,545 --> 01:17:08,717
I will die. They anyways will kill me.

827
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:11,175
Who will fulfill our Grand ma's dream.

828
01:17:11,255 --> 01:17:14,760
Damn, for what you did I messed
with the man whom I had to impress.

829
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:16,884
When he said Karthika, you should have
asked which Karthika right?

830
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:18,277
Did you not have the interest
on the information given,

831
01:17:18,357 --> 01:17:19,786
which you had on the money taken?
You idiot.

832
01:17:19,866 --> 01:17:21,840
Though the girl was average,

833
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:27,077
I thought you would have asked details
of the Telugu girl and gave her details.

834
01:17:27,157 --> 01:17:29,842
Hey, did you already know that
he is Telugu? - I know.

835
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:30,925
How?

836
01:17:31,134 --> 01:17:33,799
I asked from where and he said
Hyderabad.

837
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:36,216
I asked every question other than this.

838
01:17:36,508 --> 01:17:40,151
He had been saying,
dude he may be a Telugu fellow.

839
01:17:40,231 --> 01:17:41,428
I did not listen to.

840
01:17:41,508 --> 01:17:44,673
I was a blind horse and ate up
even tablets feeling it as feed.

841
01:17:44,883 --> 01:17:47,386
Hey, why do you think of the past?
Leave it. - Go.

842
01:17:47,466 --> 01:17:48,632
You are too much Sir.

843
01:17:48,715 --> 01:17:50,181
Independence has come long back.

844
01:17:50,261 --> 01:17:52,882
But still, we are thinking
every year about August 15th, right?

845
01:17:52,962 --> 01:17:56,048
You and your dirty logic.
- What will you lose, what would you say?

846
01:17:56,215 --> 01:17:59,404
Like killing rats while inventing
medicine for humans,

847
01:17:59,484 --> 01:18:01,177
you trapped me in the middle.

848
01:18:01,257 --> 01:18:02,729
They would kill
if I go into the village.

849
01:18:02,809 --> 01:18:04,603
They will kill here,
if they know you are Telugu.

850
01:18:04,683 --> 01:18:05,548
Friend.

851
01:18:16,464 --> 01:18:19,339
I did not believe all these days
though you said, he is our guy.

852
01:18:26,214 --> 01:18:27,570
How did you find out guys?

853
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,921
He is drinking even in weekdays,
means he is a Tamil guy.

854
01:18:33,963 --> 01:18:35,005
Why did you come?

855
01:18:35,881 --> 01:18:37,171
Hey.

856
01:18:37,251 --> 01:18:39,546
He was seen talking to
Telugu guys in the mess.

857
01:18:39,626 --> 01:18:41,755
We thus took him to a place with
no cameras and bashed him up.

858
01:18:41,835 --> 01:18:45,087
You bashed up just for talking?
What if kept in the room?

859
01:18:45,318 --> 01:18:47,334
They would if not known
and will they if known or what?

860
01:18:47,414 --> 01:18:50,462
Hey, if kept even if not know
we would stamp on the neck and kill.

861
01:18:50,542 --> 01:18:52,677
I may be ok,
but my friend would strip him,

862
01:18:52,757 --> 01:18:55,462
stab and kill taking him
all over the village and hitting.

863
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,129
Stop it dude.

864
01:18:57,584 --> 01:18:58,832
Hey, ok talking before me

865
01:18:58,912 --> 01:19:00,923
but what is this talking about
Telugu guys before you?

866
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:04,087
Forgive me brother, I will never again
in life talk with Telugu guys.

867
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:07,147
I will kill if anyone speaks from now too.
Forgive me bro for just this one time.

868
01:19:07,227 --> 01:19:09,667
Hey dude, he is peed in fear.

869
01:19:09,747 --> 01:19:11,656
Why you about him,
we will take care of him.

870
01:19:11,736 --> 01:19:13,753
Get up idiot, go away now.

871
01:19:14,336 --> 01:19:18,275
Poor guys thought that fellow peed,
they do not know it is you.

872
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:27,294
He came to my village and I did not catch.
He messed with me and slipped away.

873
01:19:27,536 --> 01:19:32,428
He came to my house and was not caught.
Why is your batch being beside me?

874
01:19:35,174 --> 01:19:36,219
Muthu.

875
01:19:36,418 --> 01:19:41,585
Muthu, do not get into anger.
From now, I will know everything he does

876
01:19:42,777 --> 01:19:44,347
Oh, you did not know
when power was gone yesterday

877
01:19:44,427 --> 01:19:45,956
and will you know whatever he does?

878
01:19:46,212 --> 01:19:48,543
Muthu, son in law.

879
01:19:51,918 --> 01:19:53,891
Huh, we will lose prestige
going for an assembly.

880
01:19:53,971 --> 01:19:56,292
Leaving him so, self would be dead.

881
01:19:56,584 --> 01:19:57,831
To go college and kill him,

882
01:19:57,911 --> 01:20:01,292
tradition by the elder man
would be broken. Go away.

883
01:20:04,204 --> 01:20:05,617
You are saying he is a college boy.

884
01:20:05,697 --> 01:20:07,667
You feel your daughter
do not know who he is?

885
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,660
When our people also fear
to come into this house,

886
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:14,375
an enemy guy has come and
who do you think has given the lenience?

887
01:20:16,671 --> 01:20:21,171
Short dresses, colored hairs,
English and tattoo...

888
01:20:21,251 --> 01:20:24,861
Oh no,
are these the qualities of our girls?

889
01:20:26,415 --> 01:20:28,369
At least has he studied well?

890
01:20:28,525 --> 01:20:32,583
Her zeroes are more than the eggs laid by
our hens in the backyard.

891
01:20:34,441 --> 01:20:37,165
None would question even she
does not become an Engineer Muthu.

892
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:39,710
Suppose if she goes to
an English picture with someone,

893
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:42,832
all who see would spit on our faces.

894
01:20:46,349 --> 01:20:48,832
Karthika... Karthika.

895
01:20:49,069 --> 01:20:50,242
Father.

896
01:20:52,999 --> 01:20:54,956
The guy who came home yesterday
is from your college, right?

897
01:20:55,287 --> 01:20:57,421
Yes father.
- Why did he come?

898
01:20:58,403 --> 01:20:59,914
Old idiot has trapped now.

899
01:21:01,864 --> 01:21:02,956
Monkey faced.

900
01:21:03,393 --> 01:21:04,712
Open your mouth.

901
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:09,539
Are you doubting me, father?

902
01:21:11,163 --> 01:21:14,269
So many do come for functions at home.

903
01:21:14,349 --> 01:21:16,663
How would I know
if you ask why has he come?

904
01:21:16,821 --> 01:21:19,288
Oh no, she is started a drama again.

905
01:21:20,274 --> 01:21:22,205
If this goes so,
I will never go again to the College.

906
01:21:24,516 --> 01:21:27,126
Ok, stop and sit back at home.
- Huh.

907
01:21:28,482 --> 01:21:29,682
Tit for tat.

908
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:32,148
I had been saying from first not to study.

909
01:21:32,228 --> 01:21:35,829
You forced me to study
and put me in the hostel.

910
01:21:35,912 --> 01:21:37,892
I thought ok,
my dad being the head of village.

911
01:21:37,972 --> 01:21:40,787
would proudly say his daughter is
an Engineer.

912
01:21:41,764 --> 01:21:45,412
and studied day and night.
Do you know, I passed in first class?

913
01:21:45,878 --> 01:21:48,371
You know, whole class
would even clap for me?

914
01:21:48,451 --> 01:21:51,329
Call the Principal Muthu,
her secret would be out.

915
01:21:51,409 --> 01:21:54,746
Hey old lady, father has faith in me.
He will not call.

916
01:21:54,929 --> 01:21:56,870
Oh, look there.

917
01:21:57,286 --> 01:21:58,662
Principal sir.
- Say please.

918
01:21:58,829 --> 01:22:01,285
This is Veera Muthu speaking.
How is my daughter studying?

919
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:02,453
Switch on the speaker.

920
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:05,022
She is a very bad student.

921
01:22:05,343 --> 01:22:06,703
Have I not said?

922
01:22:06,783 --> 01:22:11,036
If anybody says so,
make them kneel down for an hour.

923
01:22:13,211 --> 01:22:17,077
She is a brilliant student. She
is the class topper in the recent exams.

924
01:22:22,178 --> 01:22:25,660
That is my daughter!
You go to college dear. - Ok...

925
01:22:27,024 --> 01:22:28,118
Hey Sami.

926
01:22:28,727 --> 01:22:32,574
We cannot stop his anger and
he cannot bear his happiness. Bad luck!

927
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:33,894
Hey...

928
01:22:38,712 --> 01:22:40,312
Go idiot!
- Damn.

929
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:50,576
Friendship means yours dude
You come together and leave together.

930
01:22:52,955 --> 01:22:56,035
Hey, I will narrate a small story to you.
Say what you understood.

931
01:22:56,190 --> 01:23:00,034
Two doves are in a friendship.
Both are living in the same nest.

932
01:23:00,118 --> 01:23:03,200
After some days, it came to know that
the other is not a dove but a snake.

933
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:05,205
If said to leave snake
would swallow the dove.

934
01:23:05,285 --> 01:23:07,992
If said it is not a dove,
all the other doves would kill it.

935
01:23:08,344 --> 01:23:10,033
What do you say is
the position of this dove now?

936
01:23:10,117 --> 01:23:11,856
You are the most powerful
as snake in our batch.

937
01:23:11,936 --> 01:23:13,620
Do not harm that dove dude.

938
01:23:14,867 --> 01:23:18,163
Ask your dad to make the fees ready
even for next year, for safety.

939
01:23:18,741 --> 01:23:20,075
You crazy idiot.

940
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,314
Hey, why are you not
answering when called.

941
01:23:23,394 --> 01:23:25,449
and no replies for the message.
What happened?

942
01:23:26,417 --> 01:23:30,032
Come on talk. I will not leave
your hand till you speak up.

943
01:23:30,677 --> 01:23:32,199
It cannot happen.
- Why?

944
01:23:32,774 --> 01:23:34,615
Why did you not say that
you are a Telugu guy?

945
01:23:34,918 --> 01:23:36,074
Did you say to be a Tamilian?

946
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:38,490
Even if you were so particular,
you should asked who I was.

947
01:23:38,664 --> 01:23:40,741
How do I know who is
Telugu and Tamil here?

948
01:23:41,111 --> 01:23:42,099
Damn it,

949
01:23:42,557 --> 01:23:44,099
because of the information
from that idiot,

950
01:23:44,179 --> 01:23:45,241
I impressed some
other guy leaving aside your father.

951
01:23:45,448 --> 01:23:47,119
Now even if I impress your dad,
he would not listen.

952
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:50,328
It is my mistake to like you without
knowing who you were.

953
01:23:50,408 --> 01:23:51,698
It will not work out, leave it.

954
01:23:52,531 --> 01:23:56,281
Oh, after knowing me to be
Telugu you lost interest on me right?

955
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:02,754
I am saying it is not
so easy for us to be together.

956
01:24:03,652 --> 01:24:05,341
You have seen yourself
what happened,

957
01:24:05,421 --> 01:24:06,947
if a Telugu person has
just come into the house.

958
01:24:08,322 --> 01:24:10,415
And if said to come in as son in law?

959
01:24:10,495 --> 01:24:13,197
For us to come together,
this village should first come together.

960
01:24:13,863 --> 01:24:15,364
That cannot happen in this life time.

961
01:24:28,255 --> 01:24:29,465
Hey.

962
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:31,370
Hey Satya.

963
01:24:34,841 --> 01:24:36,108
Why did you have a Telugu guy
in the room?

964
01:24:36,188 --> 01:24:38,587
There is no mistake from my end sir,
it is all his.

965
01:24:39,476 --> 01:24:43,237
It is me, just to wake you up.
- Why do you play so with my life, dude?

966
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:47,628
No happiness and no peace,
will you not let me even sleep?

967
01:24:47,802 --> 01:24:49,316
You should not waste life with sleep.

968
01:24:49,396 --> 01:24:51,070
You would anyways completely sleep
after death right?

969
01:24:51,153 --> 01:24:52,528
Looks like you are going
to kill me right away.

970
01:24:52,653 --> 01:24:55,112
It is ok, but what needs to be done to
make this village get united?

971
01:24:55,192 --> 01:24:58,028
Village will not get united unless that
Veera Muthu and Kesava get united.

972
01:24:58,702 --> 01:25:02,086
My father in law is a fool,
he will not listen.

973
01:25:02,166 --> 01:25:03,759
How do we get them united?

974
01:25:07,752 --> 01:25:10,244
Will you eat Biriyani?
- Yes, where?

975
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:21,110
Why do you play with my life
on the name of Biriyani?

976
01:25:21,191 --> 01:25:23,171
They would kill knowing me as a
Tamil guy knowing here. Oh no!

977
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:25,026
That is why I made you wear this T-shirt.

978
01:25:37,238 --> 01:25:39,650
My house is got a charm
with your arrival son. Move in...

979
01:25:42,735 --> 01:25:45,234
Who is this man?
- My friend, uncle.

980
01:25:46,025 --> 01:25:48,650
Sir, I doubt this fellow belongs
to the neighboring village.

981
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:56,778
You will go blind doubting
a guy wearing the T-shirt of NTR.

982
01:25:56,858 --> 01:25:58,195
Come in please.

983
01:26:01,391 --> 01:26:03,608
It is same like I am seeing myself.

984
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:05,066
Oh.

985
01:26:05,357 --> 01:26:08,899
Dishes are hot, do not hesitate.
- Ok sir.

986
01:26:09,315 --> 01:26:10,926
Baby Karthika.
- Yes dad.

987
01:26:11,006 --> 01:26:12,524
Your classmate has come.

988
01:26:15,341 --> 01:26:18,367
Keshav uncle,
I have a doubt and do not misunderstand.

989
01:26:18,447 --> 01:26:20,732
Why have you named
your daughter as Karthika?

990
01:26:20,929 --> 01:26:24,898
That idiot Veeramuthu named his daughter
as Karthika

991
01:26:24,978 --> 01:26:26,940
and that means the best girl it seems.

992
01:26:27,278 --> 01:26:30,943
Is only his daughter
the best and not mine?

993
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:36,272
Thus I named even my daughter as Karthika.
Come on eat.

994
01:26:37,106 --> 01:26:40,606
Dear, I do not have a son.

995
01:26:42,226 --> 01:26:45,013
I have a wish that a guy making
the enemies

996
01:26:45,093 --> 01:26:46,939
run away should come as my son in law.

997
01:26:48,439 --> 01:26:49,856
Will you marry my daughter?

998
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:54,481
Sir, I am in love with
daughter of Veeramuthu.

999
01:26:57,624 --> 01:26:58,751
Kill them guys.

1000
01:27:02,735 --> 01:27:05,879
When I called and am asking to give
my daughter in marriage,

1001
01:27:05,959 --> 01:27:08,147
you say to be in love
with daughter of my enemy?

1002
01:27:11,061 --> 01:27:12,547
Sir, what do you get
if your daughter marries?

1003
01:27:12,626 --> 01:27:14,523
You just get a son in law
and a husband for your daughter.

1004
01:27:15,646 --> 01:27:17,980
And if marry his daughter?
- If you marry?

1005
01:27:18,188 --> 01:27:20,688
If I marry, our guy will be
the son in law of their house.

1006
01:27:21,145 --> 01:27:28,146
That means, he would wash legs of our guy.
He would bend before our guy.

1007
01:27:28,775 --> 01:27:32,312
Ours will be the upper hand
and this is called a plan.

1008
01:27:32,502 --> 01:27:35,979
Yes.
- Excuse me.

1009
01:27:36,578 --> 01:27:38,854
Is that girl in love with you?

1010
01:27:38,934 --> 01:27:41,770
She will give her life sir. But your help
is needed for our marriage to take place.

1011
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:44,937
Son, you forget about this matter now,

1012
01:27:45,686 --> 01:27:51,019
the whole village talks about and that
Veeramuthu feels you are the only option.

1013
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:54,061
I will get your marriage done so grandly.

1014
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:58,378
I am giving you the word,
that girl is yours.

1015
01:31:14,873 --> 01:31:16,321
Hey, come on.

1016
01:31:16,401 --> 01:31:17,161
Hey, come on.

1017
01:31:17,241 --> 01:31:18,272
Stop it guys.

1018
01:31:20,177 --> 01:31:21,228
Stop it guys.

1019
01:31:21,533 --> 01:31:22,694
Hit that fellow, come on hit.

1020
01:31:23,328 --> 01:31:24,345
Stop it guys.

1021
01:31:29,795 --> 01:31:30,907
What happened?

1022
01:31:45,073 --> 01:31:49,453
What is this messing with our girls,
thinking there is none to punish them?

1023
01:31:51,735 --> 01:31:52,733
What is this sir?

1024
01:31:52,949 --> 01:31:53,906
What have I said?

1025
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:59,019
I said to get your marriage done
so great that Veeramuthu is left

1026
01:31:59,099 --> 01:32:00,989
with no other option than you.

1027
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,114
Who would marry that girl?

1028
01:32:04,906 --> 01:32:06,238
He has no other option.

1029
01:32:06,697 --> 01:32:08,448
You are his son in law, get fixed.

1030
01:32:08,682 --> 01:32:10,155
Not that sir, listen to me.

1031
01:32:10,905 --> 01:32:12,239
Come on, he should do the same.

1032
01:32:12,489 --> 01:32:15,447
Now that old man will say,
happened is happened

1033
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:19,655
and would say to give her to you in
marriage for not to be losing the prestige.

1034
01:32:20,387 --> 01:32:21,158
You see.

1035
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:22,918
This is not the time to think past is past

1036
01:32:22,998 --> 01:32:24,780
and think about prestige of
the girl would be damaged.

1037
01:32:26,779 --> 01:32:27,907
What Kesava,

1038
01:32:28,197 --> 01:32:31,737
do you pull a girl onto the roads?

1039
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:33,572
A lady means the Goddess,

1040
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:37,447
if that bad omen hits our village,
we would be ruined.

1041
01:32:37,987 --> 01:32:41,029
Your eyes have reached above the head
and thus you messed with the girls.

1042
01:32:45,029 --> 01:32:46,195
Ask Muthu for forgiveness.

1043
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:48,116
Sir.

1044
01:32:48,196 --> 01:32:50,653
What idiot, are you opposing my words?

1045
01:32:53,612 --> 01:32:57,236
I will buy your whole property,
which you feel as strength

1046
01:32:57,841 --> 01:32:59,528
and drive you away from
this village right from here.

1047
01:33:00,236 --> 01:33:02,903
Will you ask to forgive
or go away from the village?

1048
01:33:04,738 --> 01:33:05,986
Forgive me Veeramuthu.

1049
01:33:19,155 --> 01:33:20,401
What boy,

1050
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,495
you came to a new place and
why do you need about the fights here?

1051
01:33:25,154 --> 01:33:27,501
No problem if you go from
here without a degree,

1052
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:28,860
but take care that
you go alive from here.

1053
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:33,802
No more assembly if you again mess
with that girl or this village.

1054
01:33:34,398 --> 01:33:36,026
Hey Muthu, leave for this time.

1055
01:33:36,106 --> 01:33:40,151
Look old man, I am inviting at the
same place where I am insulted.

1056
01:33:40,369 --> 01:33:44,693
I will get a foreign match in a week
and get my daughter married.

1057
01:33:44,859 --> 01:33:47,608
If anybody tries to come in
the way saying love,

1058
01:33:47,983 --> 01:33:50,651
no more assemblies
but will only be a post mortem.

1059
01:33:52,607 --> 01:33:54,859
Come on guys.

1060
01:33:58,297 --> 01:33:59,157
Go.

1061
01:34:06,858 --> 01:34:08,442
Bye.
- Take care.

1062
01:34:09,948 --> 01:34:10,891
Bye.

1063
01:34:11,047 --> 01:34:12,149
Bye girls.
- Bye.

1064
01:34:23,734 --> 01:34:26,149
Where they used to fight to death
in regional feelings.

1065
01:34:27,435 --> 01:34:29,191
I made the word region
disappear from this College.

1066
01:34:30,256 --> 01:34:32,065
Though there were
so many fights in this village,

1067
01:34:32,884 --> 01:34:35,107
I could make my college
free from all those.

1068
01:34:36,106 --> 01:34:41,315
And now, a fight took place in that village
because of a student from my college.

1069
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:45,190
Those who never used
to eye at my college

1070
01:34:46,231 --> 01:34:48,605
and now pointed fingers at me
and took their girl out from my college.

1071
01:34:50,148 --> 01:34:51,980
You are a black mark in my career.

1072
01:34:53,397 --> 01:34:55,456
I am going to rusticate
you from this college. Yes.

1073
01:34:55,536 --> 01:34:57,189
What you see is not just the world sir.

1074
01:35:02,343 --> 01:35:04,165
Nothing here is correct as you think.

1075
01:35:04,807 --> 01:35:08,688
Every guy is been acting different before
and behind the CC camera.

1076
01:35:10,272 --> 01:35:13,104
It is not like all are together
as there is no fencing in the college.

1077
01:35:13,719 --> 01:35:15,314
Regional feeling is in their blood.

1078
01:35:15,772 --> 01:35:18,646
Thus Telugu guys feel me as Tamil guy

1079
01:35:18,986 --> 01:35:21,771
and the Tamil guys feel me as a Telugu
and are treating me as enemy sir.

1080
01:35:23,188 --> 01:35:25,591
There is no need for the shadow of fights
from the village to fall here.

1081
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,354
They have been fighting
once a month right here.

1082
01:35:27,771 --> 01:35:28,741
What?

1083
01:35:30,492 --> 01:35:33,603
All these days they made us get hit
by our fellow and roamed dominating.

1084
01:35:33,812 --> 01:35:34,971
Come on guys.
<b><font color="#ff0000"><i>MAZE HDRelease</i></font></b>

1085
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:44,478
What is your opinion on the Telugu guys?

1086
01:35:45,395 --> 01:35:48,437
Poor guys are good,
they made Bahubali right?

1087
01:35:48,562 --> 01:35:51,565
Is it for that, you backstabbed us with
the inspiration of Kattappa character?

1088
01:35:51,645 --> 01:35:52,482
What is backstabbing?

1089
01:35:52,562 --> 01:35:54,133
Backstabbing means to bang on the back.

1090
01:35:54,213 --> 01:35:55,930
Come on hit...
- No... please.

1091
01:35:56,010 --> 01:35:56,645
Oh no.

1092
01:35:57,532 --> 01:35:58,221
Oh no.

1093
01:35:58,301 --> 01:35:59,064
No.

1094
01:35:59,144 --> 01:36:00,478
Hey, why do you hit among yourselves.

1095
01:36:02,019 --> 01:36:04,613
We have come to hit you.
Come on guys, let us bash them up.

1096
01:36:04,769 --> 01:36:05,894
Come on guys.
- Come.

1097
01:36:05,977 --> 01:36:08,019
Hey, listen to me.

1098
01:36:09,435 --> 01:36:11,144
Hey, do not fight... Hey Harsha...
Hey Harsha...

1099
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:13,497
Do not fight guys, you get hurt.
Listen to me.

1100
01:36:13,577 --> 01:36:16,477
Hey Venu... Hey please.

1101
01:36:19,707 --> 01:36:21,000
Why did you stop?

1102
01:36:21,586 --> 01:36:22,667
Come on fight,

1103
01:36:25,213 --> 01:36:26,393
there are no cameras too here right?

1104
01:36:27,054 --> 01:36:29,475
Oh, is it that I got to know?

1105
01:36:30,324 --> 01:36:33,143
You insult within,
fight within and even kill if required.

1106
01:36:33,485 --> 01:36:34,725
But, you feel I should not get to know.

1107
01:36:34,892 --> 01:36:39,184
Because, I give scholarships
if you cannot pay the college fees.

1108
01:36:39,897 --> 01:36:42,559
It is me to excuse and allow
if you cannot pay the exam fees.

1109
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:46,809
When you have no food to eat, it is me
who pay your mess fees from my salary.

1110
01:36:47,767 --> 01:36:51,434
That is why you act well
disciplined before me, right?

1111
01:36:52,255 --> 01:36:53,309
You are cheaters.

1112
01:36:55,599 --> 01:36:57,434
What profit do you get by hitting so?

1113
01:36:58,135 --> 01:37:02,474
Will you get good marks or good jobs?
Will your families get better?

1114
01:37:02,944 --> 01:37:05,641
Say you have some small profit
and I too will join you in fighting.

1115
01:37:07,349 --> 01:37:12,974
Enough of living so drawing borders
in between nations, states and villages.

1116
01:37:13,683 --> 01:37:15,390
Why these borders even in between humans?

1117
01:37:18,765 --> 01:37:21,058
I am preparing the next generation.

1118
01:37:22,183 --> 01:37:25,682
I thought that this generation would
abolish the fencing in this village.

1119
01:37:28,234 --> 01:37:30,472
But you abolished my belief.

1120
01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:39,139
For the mistake I did believing you,
I am rusticating myself from this college.

1121
01:37:41,473 --> 01:37:42,140
Goodbye.

1122
01:37:42,223 --> 01:37:42,955
Sir, sir.

1123
01:37:43,035 --> 01:37:45,389
It is me to say goodbye and not you sir.

1124
01:37:46,344 --> 01:37:50,639
I was greedy for earning but not to widen
the gap in between them sir.

1125
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:54,352
If you leave the college
and go for my mistake,

1126
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,805
this college will get closed sir.

1127
01:37:56,471 --> 01:37:57,681
I do not want that sin on me sir.

1128
01:37:58,014 --> 01:37:59,721
We committed
so many mistakes till date sir.

1129
01:38:00,129 --> 01:38:01,471
But we never felt bad.

1130
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:03,805
But now we are feeling very bad sir

1131
01:38:06,096 --> 01:38:07,888
We will change like
the students you wished for, sir.

1132
01:38:08,456 --> 01:38:09,930
Believe us just for this time sir.

1133
01:38:11,595 --> 01:38:12,596
Not that you should believe sir,

1134
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:14,184
I am speaking with a Telugu guy for the
first time in life

1135
01:38:14,264 --> 01:38:15,637
to show that we have changed.

1136
01:38:16,783 --> 01:38:17,638
I am sorry dude.

1137
01:38:18,982 --> 01:38:20,795
I am sorry dude.

1138
01:38:22,784 --> 01:38:25,887
A good has come because of a mistake
you did knowingly or unknowingly.

1139
01:38:26,685 --> 01:38:28,637
I wish the same to take place
even in case of this village.

1140
01:38:29,762 --> 01:38:33,273
If you need any help from me
in this regard,

1141
01:38:33,353 --> 01:38:35,636
you can come to me anytime. Ok?

1142
01:38:42,136 --> 01:38:43,179
Sir.
- Yes.

1143
01:38:43,365 --> 01:38:45,011
This is the house of Veeramuthu sir.
- Is it?

1144
01:38:45,324 --> 01:38:46,053
Dad.
- Yes.

1145
01:38:46,261 --> 01:38:47,178
He is after all a driver,

1146
01:38:47,561 --> 01:38:48,679
he should stop where we ask to.

1147
01:38:48,759 --> 01:38:50,469
But, what is us getting down
where he stops?

1148
01:38:50,553 --> 01:38:51,626
Show some attitude.

1149
01:38:51,706 --> 01:38:54,348
Leave it son, it is already late.

1150
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:55,261
Mummy.

1151
01:38:55,341 --> 01:38:56,802
You say no to what my son said?

1152
01:38:56,885 --> 01:38:57,928
We should take the options.

1153
01:38:58,008 --> 01:38:58,754
No need now son.

1154
01:38:58,834 --> 01:39:00,593
What are you talking, idiot Rutherford?

1155
01:39:07,678 --> 01:39:10,052
Take the car for a round
and stop only when son says to stop.

1156
01:39:10,489 --> 01:39:11,634
I love you daddy.

1157
01:39:18,093 --> 01:39:21,301
Hey stop it,
Dad this is the house of Veeramuthu.

1158
01:39:21,509 --> 01:39:24,301
Though you have seen for the first time,
you recognized well son.

1159
01:39:24,384 --> 01:39:25,832
I am all like you mom.

1160
01:39:28,854 --> 01:39:30,301
Coffee is very good, brother in law.

1161
01:39:31,181 --> 01:39:34,259
Son has a nursery business
in Nigeria, brother.

1162
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:39,717
You grow crops?

1163
01:39:40,378 --> 01:39:43,592
Why about that topic now, show the girl.

1164
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:49,800
Watch your mouth.

1165
01:39:50,033 --> 01:39:51,341
See, the girl has come son.

1166
01:39:57,434 --> 01:39:59,671
Girl is like a Tanzavur doll.

1167
01:39:59,751 --> 01:40:01,465
What are you talking idiot Rutherford?

1168
01:40:02,198 --> 01:40:03,841
Not your feelings,
but my feelings are important.

1169
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:08,236
I need to talk for two minutes
in private with this doll.

1170
01:40:08,316 --> 01:40:09,674
Without your permission.

1171
01:40:11,925 --> 01:40:14,685
All these are common these days,
right brother in law?

1172
01:40:14,765 --> 01:40:17,064
Let us leave those two here, go out.

1173
01:40:28,256 --> 01:40:29,274
Hello,

1174
01:40:30,198 --> 01:40:31,798
what is this mess all over the village?

1175
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:34,548
Did you love anybody?

1176
01:40:36,226 --> 01:40:38,588
No problem, say it. You can trust me.

1177
01:40:38,946 --> 01:40:40,464
Will you say treating
me as a friend please?

1178
01:40:40,881 --> 01:40:43,297
Yes, I am in deep love with a person.

1179
01:40:43,976 --> 01:40:46,005
Even if I get married to you,
he will remain in my heart.

1180
01:40:50,213 --> 01:40:51,297
This is the love.

1181
01:40:51,533 --> 01:40:53,962
This is the love. That is true love.

1182
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:55,472
Hats off.

1183
01:40:57,630 --> 01:41:00,130
If you do not mind,
can I talk to him once? Please.

1184
01:41:00,505 --> 01:41:01,316
Okay.

1185
01:41:02,421 --> 01:41:03,495
Dial please.

1186
01:41:08,129 --> 01:41:08,835
Hello.

1187
01:41:08,915 --> 01:41:09,717
Hello, who...?

1188
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:11,462
Hello bro, one minute.

1189
01:41:12,171 --> 01:41:15,541
Will you repeat what you
just said once again? Please.

1190
01:41:15,796 --> 01:41:18,087
Even if I get married to you,
he will remain in my heart.

1191
01:41:19,045 --> 01:41:20,104
Karthika...

1192
01:41:21,254 --> 01:41:22,836
Thank you so much bro.

1193
01:41:24,501 --> 01:41:26,503
Yes, I thought revenge
may miss out somewhere in life.

1194
01:41:26,955 --> 01:41:28,878
But I got that chance because of you.

1195
01:41:29,062 --> 01:41:29,921
What revenge?

1196
01:41:30,212 --> 01:41:31,920
I loved a girl deeply bro.

1197
01:41:32,854 --> 01:41:36,878
At the time of marriage, her lover came
and took her away and married her.

1198
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:40,378
I fixed right then.

1199
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:43,637
when someone married
taking away my lover,

1200
01:41:43,717 --> 01:41:46,585
I too should surely
marry lover of someone else.

1201
01:41:47,794 --> 01:41:50,586
Hey, are you any mad? What is
taking the revenge of someone over me?

1202
01:41:50,816 --> 01:41:53,252
Are we not killing all mosquitoes with.
All-out as some mosquito bit us?

1203
01:41:53,454 --> 01:41:54,210
This too is the same.

1204
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:59,501
Hey co-brother,
I will marry this girl in a week.

1205
01:42:01,578 --> 01:42:03,918
Do whatever you wish
to for saving your love.

1206
01:42:04,582 --> 01:42:07,980
You too should go through the pain and
suffering I went through the love failure.

1207
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:12,251
Hey, to know about your character one
must know about your friend.

1208
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:15,418
But to know about your capacity,
one must know who your enemy is.

1209
01:42:15,831 --> 01:42:17,418
You copied this from our Tamil film
Thani Oruvan

1210
01:42:17,498 --> 01:42:19,043
and used in your Telugu cinema.

1211
01:42:19,448 --> 01:42:20,376
I am hurt

1212
01:42:21,043 --> 01:42:22,848
you are my enemy and fix for it.

1213
01:42:24,916 --> 01:42:27,958
Dad, I liked the girl very much.

1214
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:30,292
Nothing like engagement,
but directly the marriage.

1215
01:42:30,624 --> 01:42:32,458
What a marriage without engagement, son?

1216
01:42:42,292 --> 01:42:44,791
Brother in law,
we shall directly go for the marriage.

1217
01:42:44,871 --> 01:42:45,917
I love you daddy...

1218
01:42:58,130 --> 01:42:59,666
What a marriage in a week?

1219
01:43:02,124 --> 01:43:03,956
That too with a mental fellow?

1220
01:43:04,248 --> 01:43:05,832
Say if you are ok and we shall bring her.

1221
01:43:05,957 --> 01:43:08,915
You wait dude,
what to bring the girl whom he loved?

1222
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:12,373
Still, Keshavulu likes you right?
Then what is the problem?

1223
01:43:12,581 --> 01:43:13,748
Bro, were you not in town?

1224
01:43:13,831 --> 01:43:14,774
It is been a week I had been
to my in laws house

1225
01:43:14,854 --> 01:43:16,540
and am just back yesterday.

1226
01:43:16,623 --> 01:43:19,873
You... I am in love with daughter
of Veeramuthu.

1227
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:21,581
Daughter of Veeramuthu?

1228
01:43:21,873 --> 01:43:23,540
Then, you asked for details of Keshavulu?

1229
01:43:23,996 --> 01:43:25,955
Oh, a misunderstanding?

1230
01:43:26,206 --> 01:43:28,229
Still, why with these Tamil people
dude instead of happily

1231
01:43:28,309 --> 01:43:30,205
looking out for
a Telugu girl and marrying?

1232
01:43:30,372 --> 01:43:31,617
Why, what is less for a Tamil girl?

1233
01:43:31,697 --> 01:43:33,597
What is in Telugu people
and what is not in the Tamil?

1234
01:43:33,677 --> 01:43:34,941
Why do you second look at?

1235
01:43:35,161 --> 01:43:36,622
We are Telugu.

1236
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:43,539
Are you Telugu?

1237
01:43:44,372 --> 01:43:47,583
Why do you say so?
I am the fan of Megastar from childhood.

1238
01:43:47,663 --> 01:43:50,496
When I used to do the sitar step those days
- Hey, stop it,

1239
01:43:52,831 --> 01:43:54,079
I want that girl somehow.

1240
01:43:54,654 --> 01:43:56,746
For us to get together,
that village should first get together.

1241
01:43:56,996 --> 01:44:00,083
For that to happen, I should first know
what exactly the issue was.

1242
01:44:00,163 --> 01:44:01,328
My grandpa knows it sir.

1243
01:44:01,453 --> 01:44:03,704
He used to say stories about
the village and the issues.

1244
01:44:03,996 --> 01:44:05,995
Brother knows the address if you want.

1245
01:44:06,663 --> 01:44:09,162
Look old man, hey old man...

1246
01:44:09,603 --> 01:44:12,856
College boys have come to
know about the village, get up.

1247
01:44:14,366 --> 01:44:16,037
I am very happy guys,

1248
01:44:16,662 --> 01:44:19,828
I am very happy guys,
we all once lived like brothers.

1249
01:44:20,384 --> 01:44:22,912
We used to visit houses of each other.

1250
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,911
But now we are fighting with each other.

1251
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:28,203
Why exactly did this village get
separated grandpa?

1252
01:44:28,967 --> 01:44:31,808
That was 1953,

1253
01:44:31,888 --> 01:44:36,327
the time when Telugu state was
getting separated from the Madras state

1254
01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:44,536
Tirupuram villagers
are hereby informed that.

1255
01:44:45,327 --> 01:44:48,398
the border lines have been identified as
Telugu state

1256
01:44:48,478 --> 01:44:50,535
is being separated from Madras state.

1257
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,493
As per that the border here is passing
from the middle of Tirupuram village.

1258
01:44:57,118 --> 01:45:02,386
If you all give your agreement
for this and sign here,

1259
01:45:02,467 --> 01:45:06,617
center has asked to split
this village into two states.

1260
01:45:07,075 --> 01:45:09,410
Hey, where have you come
and what are you talking?

1261
01:45:09,785 --> 01:45:12,951
You know what happens if our landlord
comes to know about this matter?

1262
01:45:13,247 --> 01:45:15,159
Do you know who the landlords
of this village are?

1263
01:45:15,575 --> 01:45:18,141
Hail to Bhupathipandya Veeramuthu.

1264
01:45:18,221 --> 01:45:21,159
Hail to Bhupathipandya Veeramuthu.

1265
01:45:55,622 --> 01:45:57,948
Hail to Raobahaddur Keshavulu.

1266
01:45:58,135 --> 01:46:00,490
Hail to Raobahaddur Keshavulu.

1267
01:46:06,657 --> 01:46:10,698
Who are you separate us
living as brothers?

1268
01:46:11,075 --> 01:46:12,906
Sir, this is the order of
Central Government.

1269
01:46:14,037 --> 01:46:15,598
Come on, what is that?

1270
01:46:15,678 --> 01:46:18,532
We are the Government here
and ours is the kingdom.

1271
01:46:18,698 --> 01:46:21,906
Not just now but we will be together
forever and die together.

1272
01:46:22,364 --> 01:46:24,864
If you say no and draw the border,

1273
01:46:25,906 --> 01:46:28,238
I will build your grave.

1274
01:46:28,405 --> 01:46:30,906
There is no place for borders
in between us.

1275
01:46:31,155 --> 01:46:35,363
Yes, unity is the strength,
Unity is the strength.

1276
01:46:35,443 --> 01:46:39,889
Unity is the strength.

1277
01:46:39,969 --> 01:46:41,613
Ok, go away...
- Move on, move.

1278
01:46:43,172 --> 01:46:44,821
Unity is the strength.

1279
01:46:44,946 --> 01:46:47,945
We thought to be united so forever.

1280
01:46:48,476 --> 01:46:52,654
But, we signed just the next day
and got separated.

1281
01:46:52,844 --> 01:46:55,654
What, you said unity
is the strength and clapped.

1282
01:46:55,779 --> 01:46:57,487
and next signed and separated?

1283
01:46:58,779 --> 01:46:59,987
What is happened in between that, grandpa?

1284
01:47:00,067 --> 01:47:03,856
That day... that day...

1285
01:47:05,572 --> 01:47:06,570
That day...

1286
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,390
That day...

1287
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:10,987
What happened?
- That day...

1288
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:12,922
Poor man, may be is feeling cold
and is shivering in cold.

1289
01:47:13,002 --> 01:47:14,069
Bro, take that bed sheet.

1290
01:47:14,549 --> 01:47:16,819
Not cold, but grandpa.
is into fits black dude.

1291
01:47:19,153 --> 01:47:20,069
Get up grandpa.

1292
01:47:20,861 --> 01:47:22,770
Hello...
- Hello, what dude?

1293
01:47:23,202 --> 01:47:24,403
Who is this?
- It is me, Param.

1294
01:47:24,778 --> 01:47:25,819
Param, who is this?

1295
01:47:26,028 --> 01:47:29,110
Have you not saved the number bro?
I am the to be husband of your girlfriend.

1296
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:29,986
Hey, cut the phone.

1297
01:47:31,812 --> 01:47:33,318
- Yes, this is the one.
- This is the room.

1298
01:47:59,026 --> 01:48:00,193
Old man is into consciousness.

1299
01:48:00,609 --> 01:48:02,442
Hey, Come on guys...
- It seems he awoke... come on move.

1300
01:48:03,692 --> 01:48:06,651
You stopped in between saying that day.
What exactly happened that day grandpa?

1301
01:48:07,442 --> 01:48:10,526
I was down getting fits even that day.

1302
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:13,275
I do not know what happened next.

1303
01:48:15,526 --> 01:48:17,441
He should have gone getting fits
for the first time.

1304
01:48:18,316 --> 01:48:19,483
Hey damn it, move dude.

1305
01:48:25,357 --> 01:48:26,802
I should get to know what exactly
the issue of that village is.

1306
01:48:31,636 --> 01:48:32,386
Why are you here?

1307
01:48:32,927 --> 01:48:34,301
Dad got a phone, son.

1308
01:48:39,798 --> 01:48:40,469
Hello.

1309
01:48:40,802 --> 01:48:43,010
I am the to be husband of
your daughter in law speaking.

1310
01:48:43,221 --> 01:48:44,010
Wrong number.

1311
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:45,926
Rutherford.

1312
01:48:50,009 --> 01:48:50,805
Hello.

1313
01:48:50,885 --> 01:48:52,843
Have you ever fed ten people?

1314
01:48:52,923 --> 01:48:54,717
But you are hanging up the phone,
why is it because it is free?

1315
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:56,301
What is your problem?

1316
01:48:56,493 --> 01:48:58,759
Problem is not mine but of your son.

1317
01:48:59,313 --> 01:49:01,385
I am marrying the girl he loved.

1318
01:49:01,892 --> 01:49:05,967
He first felt very bad after knowing this
and is now feeling sad.

1319
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:09,633
Before he feels mad,
you come as a dad and console him.

1320
01:49:13,661 --> 01:49:14,924
What is that fellow calling you?

1321
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:17,841
What do I know? Your phone was
switched off when I called you.

1322
01:49:18,329 --> 01:49:20,591
We got tensed thinking you may have hit
anybody again and started.

1323
01:49:21,547 --> 01:49:22,447
One minute.

1324
01:49:26,529 --> 01:49:27,841
Good morning bro.

1325
01:49:27,921 --> 01:49:30,132
I was waiting sleepless for your call.

1326
01:49:30,353 --> 01:49:32,091
You mental, why did you call my dad?

1327
01:49:32,341 --> 01:49:36,841
Simple dude,
you cut my call and I got hurt.

1328
01:49:37,052 --> 01:49:38,340
As a result, call went to your dad.

1329
01:49:38,465 --> 01:49:39,715
How do you know the number of my dad?

1330
01:49:40,007 --> 01:49:41,716
Oh no, your dad is Stalin the great.

1331
01:49:41,992 --> 01:49:43,715
Why are talking like a mad guy these days?

1332
01:49:44,048 --> 01:49:45,882
There would be no logics
for revenge co-brother.

1333
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:47,298
What exactly is your problem dude?

1334
01:49:47,548 --> 01:49:49,605
I lived suffering like
a big boss contestant

1335
01:49:49,685 --> 01:49:52,382
when I got separated from my lover.

1336
01:49:53,257 --> 01:49:58,090
I felt worst than those who
hid black money when notes were banned.

1337
01:49:58,422 --> 01:50:00,214
You too should go through that pain.

1338
01:50:00,964 --> 01:50:04,339
No time co-brother,
we ordered even for the wedding cards.

1339
01:50:04,964 --> 01:50:08,339
Still, you fight co-brother.
You know, it is getting too lazy.

1340
01:50:09,047 --> 01:50:10,671
I do not like just winning like that.

1341
01:50:11,088 --> 01:50:14,172
Let us see whether sambar
or Biriyani wins.

1342
01:50:14,464 --> 01:50:16,756
Either Sankar or Rajamouli?

1343
01:50:19,802 --> 01:50:20,901
What happened, son?

1344
01:50:31,130 --> 01:50:33,838
Son, we do neither need
this village or that marriage.

1345
01:50:34,255 --> 01:50:35,379
We will leave from here.

1346
01:50:35,670 --> 01:50:36,751
I should say you for all this.

1347
01:50:36,831 --> 01:50:38,755
You pushed the happy
going here into this place.

1348
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:39,837
What if something had gone wrong?

1349
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:43,337
Mom, had I ever fallen behind a girl
all these years?

1350
01:50:44,504 --> 01:50:45,545
Did I at least talk?

1351
01:50:47,212 --> 01:50:49,670
After seeing her,
my total interest shifted on to her, dad.

1352
01:50:51,586 --> 01:50:53,430
I always getting into fights
am now am thinking

1353
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:55,836
to make this village
in fights to come together.

1354
01:50:56,919 --> 01:50:58,462
That means,
think how much would have I liked her?

1355
01:51:01,586 --> 01:51:03,420
You always say
I should be happy ever right?

1356
01:51:04,461 --> 01:51:06,878
For me to be happy,
she should be in my life mom.

1357
01:51:07,169 --> 01:51:09,086
Not that son, your...
- Kantham,

1358
01:51:09,753 --> 01:51:12,085
he never stopped
when asked while he was into fights.

1359
01:51:12,293 --> 01:51:14,294
How do you think he would listen now
when he is in love and asked to give up?

1360
01:51:14,503 --> 01:51:16,377
What I say...
- Be calm, nothing will happen to him.

1361
01:51:18,711 --> 01:51:20,793
Son, you try for that girl.

1362
01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:23,628
We are leaving to
Hyderabad only with her. Ok!

1363
01:51:23,877 --> 01:51:24,733
Thanks Dad.

1364
01:51:30,168 --> 01:51:31,168
This is good right?

1365
01:51:31,335 --> 01:51:31,962
Yes, good.

1366
01:51:32,042 --> 01:51:33,793
How is this? See once.
- Hello grandma.

1367
01:51:33,877 --> 01:51:35,797
Yes, here dear.
- Yes.

1368
01:51:35,877 --> 01:51:37,376
Are you any pregnant?

1369
01:51:37,459 --> 01:51:38,918
I just had a water melon grandma.

1370
01:51:39,002 --> 01:51:41,334
Oh, I was thinking you are pregnant.

1371
01:51:41,709 --> 01:51:42,626
Is it the fat?

1372
01:51:43,252 --> 01:51:46,084
So many are dying but she is not.
Dirty lady, when would she die?

1373
01:51:56,001 --> 01:51:57,500
Hey, why are you so?

1374
01:51:59,709 --> 01:52:01,208
Still, what is you and crying?

1375
01:52:02,416 --> 01:52:03,834
I should meet Hari once.

1376
01:52:04,666 --> 01:52:06,625
They are not allowing to go out, right?

1377
01:52:07,166 --> 01:52:07,708
Uncle...

1378
01:52:08,583 --> 01:52:09,125
Uncle...

1379
01:52:09,208 --> 01:52:10,836
Hey Juman, where is uncle?
- He is right here sir

1380
01:52:10,916 --> 01:52:11,333
Then why is he not responding?

1381
01:52:11,413 --> 01:52:12,451
Uncle,
- Hello...

1382
01:52:12,531 --> 01:52:15,003
No problem, stand.
- Hello brother in law, are you fine?

1383
01:52:15,083 --> 01:52:16,208
You are black but...

1384
01:52:16,459 --> 01:52:18,541
Uncle, cards got printed.

1385
01:52:18,916 --> 01:52:20,874
I came to give the second card
to you as per the sentiment.

1386
01:52:20,954 --> 01:52:22,252
What second card?

1387
01:52:22,332 --> 01:52:22,999
Rutherford.

1388
01:52:25,493 --> 01:52:27,374
Apply turmeric and give
the second card to brother in law.

1389
01:52:27,454 --> 01:52:29,082
Where would we get turmeric right now?

1390
01:52:30,624 --> 01:52:31,165
Turmeric...

1391
01:52:31,882 --> 01:52:32,571
Manjal...

1392
01:52:33,498 --> 01:52:34,707
Yes total face is with turmeric.

1393
01:52:37,297 --> 01:52:37,956
Oh no!

1394
01:52:42,164 --> 01:52:43,373
Did they tie a swing
to the ears before or what?

1395
01:52:48,664 --> 01:52:49,623
You should come for marriage surely.

1396
01:52:50,456 --> 01:52:51,352
Seriously.

1397
01:52:52,488 --> 01:52:54,831
What will you have son? Tea or Coffee?
- Your daughter.

1398
01:52:56,189 --> 01:53:00,873
I mean, my son wishes both boy
and girl together to distribute the cards.

1399
01:53:00,956 --> 01:53:02,455
Super Rutherford,
ask the girl to get ready.

1400
01:53:02,973 --> 01:53:04,164
You well managed.

1401
01:53:04,308 --> 01:53:05,164
Ask the girl to get ready.

1402
01:53:05,373 --> 01:53:07,372
My head is aching
and say I cannot come mom.

1403
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:11,830
I am saying you,
go and get the girl ready.

1404
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:16,830
Where are you going son in law?

1405
01:53:17,097 --> 01:53:18,329
Rutherford.

1406
01:53:18,579 --> 01:53:22,662
You are taking their girl
and you have to say.

1407
01:53:23,156 --> 01:53:26,121
Oh I see, to their college uncle.

1408
01:53:29,062 --> 01:53:29,996
To the college?

1409
01:53:30,371 --> 01:53:31,378
Why, will you not send?

1410
01:53:31,554 --> 01:53:32,829
I mean, she says headache.

1411
01:53:39,248 --> 01:53:42,995
Oh no, you look like a Bonsoy tree,
are you her friend?

1412
01:53:43,286 --> 01:53:44,245
You crazy.

1413
01:53:44,891 --> 01:53:47,036
I would have said no for Indica.
It is Innova right? Come on.

1414
01:53:48,979 --> 01:53:50,870
Ok, have you given
all the suggestions you should?

1415
01:53:51,969 --> 01:53:54,036
I mean like,
how would you marry this fellow,

1416
01:53:54,452 --> 01:53:56,745
think once, do not compromise
in life and so on.

1417
01:53:57,033 --> 01:53:59,660
Friend characters like
you exist to give such idiotic advices.

1418
01:54:00,078 --> 01:54:01,036
I have not given any.

1419
01:54:02,192 --> 01:54:02,785
Yes,

1420
01:54:03,327 --> 01:54:06,370
I understood you are just fit
for eating but not to give advices.

1421
01:54:06,449 --> 01:54:07,327
Idiot...

1422
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:10,267
Hey.

1423
01:54:15,681 --> 01:54:17,202
Girl is great, right hubby.

1424
01:54:17,535 --> 01:54:19,368
That fellow is like
a buffalo beside her.

1425
01:54:20,357 --> 01:54:21,285
Hello bro,

1426
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:25,244
I am very happy as your lover
is becoming my wife.

1427
01:54:25,728 --> 01:54:27,618
That is why I brought her
to give you the first card.

1428
01:54:27,698 --> 01:54:28,451
Here is the card.

1429
01:54:30,244 --> 01:54:33,743
Come on, I got it printed on synthetic card
as you would attempt such waste things.

1430
01:54:33,868 --> 01:54:34,601
It cannot be torn.

1431
01:54:35,368 --> 01:54:38,659
Hello, that is even fire proof
and will not burn too.

1432
01:54:39,575 --> 01:54:40,493
It falls down when I throw, right?

1433
01:54:40,868 --> 01:54:42,451
Are you angry?

1434
01:54:43,075 --> 01:54:44,950
Come on hit bro.

1435
01:54:45,451 --> 01:54:47,492
I am actually expecting
such emotional reactions from you.

1436
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:51,617
Say something aunty.
In such a times...

1437
01:54:52,242 --> 01:54:56,158
Son, I do not know what you do
but she should come as my daughter in law.

1438
01:54:56,617 --> 01:54:59,075
This is my word and my word is an order.

1439
01:54:59,348 --> 01:55:01,570
Mother characters like you should say all
such nonsense dialogues right?

1440
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:02,405
Why do you not say?

1441
01:55:03,657 --> 01:55:05,700
Hari, I should talk
with you for two minutes.

1442
01:55:07,286 --> 01:55:08,366
Hari, you...

1443
01:55:08,657 --> 01:55:09,949
It seems she should talk
with you for two minutes. Go...

1444
01:55:10,491 --> 01:55:12,157
Talk openly for the last time
with your lover.

1445
01:55:12,574 --> 01:55:15,837
Is your heart fine?

1446
01:55:17,657 --> 01:55:18,782
Hey...
- What?

1447
01:55:18,866 --> 01:55:20,823
Whatever you try,
that girl is of my son finally.

1448
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:22,407
Why is so much of confidence?

1449
01:55:23,157 --> 01:55:24,948
Anything can be achieved
with a confidence.

1450
01:55:25,222 --> 01:55:26,657
Confidence, do you have it?

1451
01:55:26,924 --> 01:55:28,406
Yes, any doubt?

1452
01:55:31,574 --> 01:55:35,448
Push this water into this
with your confidence and let us see.

1453
01:55:35,531 --> 01:55:36,398
What?

1454
01:55:36,823 --> 01:55:39,240
Do not say such silly
and nonsense dialogues uncle.

1455
01:55:39,656 --> 01:55:42,115
Confidence is good for honey bees
and not for us.

1456
01:55:42,319 --> 01:55:44,072
Why do you mess with that idiot, hubby?

1457
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:45,530
To do a lip lock.

1458
01:55:45,917 --> 01:55:46,823
Yes, good timing?

1459
01:55:46,948 --> 01:55:47,781
Time is up.

1460
01:55:47,865 --> 01:55:48,811
Aunty...

1461
01:55:59,115 --> 01:56:00,072
Will you come with me?

1462
01:56:08,030 --> 01:56:11,071
I cannot be without you
and cannot come leaving them.

1463
01:56:17,946 --> 01:56:18,571
Wow,

1464
01:56:19,113 --> 01:56:22,748
when I marry a girl hugging
so tight instead of him,

1465
01:56:22,828 --> 01:56:24,820
he will have it uncle.

1466
01:56:24,987 --> 01:56:26,362
No past and no future.

1467
01:56:28,113 --> 01:56:29,903
Idiot, you are born as a human by mistake.

1468
01:56:30,112 --> 01:56:31,028
I love you dear uncle.

1469
01:56:41,986 --> 01:56:44,403
Hari, I need you.

1470
01:57:25,859 --> 01:57:27,275
Sir, I need your car for an hour.

1471
01:57:28,485 --> 01:57:29,942
Rekha...Give the keys.

1472
01:57:32,275 --> 01:57:33,984
I asked for keys and not kiss.

1473
01:57:34,253 --> 01:57:35,359
Oh no, sorry sir.

1474
01:57:36,567 --> 01:57:38,900
I have been observing from when he came.
You are looking different,

1475
01:57:39,150 --> 01:57:39,961
no doubt.

1476
01:57:49,234 --> 01:57:50,024
Get down...

1477
01:57:50,314 --> 01:57:52,191
He is carrying like a kid.

1478
01:57:55,983 --> 01:57:57,191
Baburao...
- Sir.

1479
01:57:57,399 --> 01:57:59,066
Why do you think has
he brought those old people?

1480
01:57:59,819 --> 01:58:02,940
It is not like he brought them sir,
it is like he brought by force.

1481
01:58:03,117 --> 01:58:03,899
What is this?

1482
01:58:07,523 --> 01:58:08,733
Get in grandpa.

1483
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:15,773
It seems they are kidnapping girls in age,
be careful. - Ok grandma.

1484
01:58:16,023 --> 01:58:18,565
Hey, where are you taking grandma?
- Hey you.

1485
01:58:26,482 --> 01:58:28,857
It will vanish,
bad sight will vanish from your shop.

1486
01:58:31,106 --> 01:58:32,481
Vanishing even in your village.

1487
01:58:33,895 --> 01:58:36,826
I came out thinking crows would take away
the fry-ons

1488
01:58:36,906 --> 01:58:39,397
and why did you get me, you dirty idiot?

1489
01:58:39,564 --> 01:58:41,612
If my son gets to know about this,

1490
01:58:41,692 --> 01:58:44,859
he will not consider
you even as kids and kill you.

1491
01:58:44,939 --> 01:58:45,897
My foot,

1492
01:58:46,106 --> 01:58:47,225
he could not do anything
when we came to your place

1493
01:58:47,305 --> 01:58:48,438
and took off the current
and this is my place.

1494
01:58:48,563 --> 01:58:51,247
If you do not sit silent,
I will press your neck

1495
01:58:51,327 --> 01:58:54,272
and throw you outside the fence,
you old idiot.

1496
01:58:55,646 --> 01:58:57,230
Forgive me grandpas and grandmas.

1497
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:59,605
I brought you here as
I was left with no other way.

1498
01:59:00,438 --> 01:59:02,664
You lived once as a single family

1499
01:59:02,744 --> 01:59:04,230
and please say me
why did you get separated?

1500
01:59:04,646 --> 01:59:06,355
Who are you to ask that?

1501
01:59:06,526 --> 01:59:09,146
You think we would say whatever asked,
if you bring us by force?

1502
01:59:11,312 --> 01:59:15,395
Once decided to forget,
no way that we shall talk about that.

1503
01:59:17,707 --> 01:59:19,547
Maybe they would have said
putting aside their prestige,

1504
01:59:19,627 --> 01:59:21,645
leave us at our homes
immediately in respect.

1505
01:59:21,729 --> 01:59:23,769
What is he asking and what would you say?

1506
01:59:24,061 --> 01:59:26,729
Not only you
but even we have mustaches.

1507
01:59:26,895 --> 01:59:30,645
Even the prawns in our rivers
have those mustaches.

1508
01:59:30,729 --> 01:59:32,686
What Chennappa, why are you talking?

1509
01:59:32,811 --> 01:59:34,812
I would have chopped that head
on the day I cut that hand

1510
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:36,519
but let you go looking
at the face of my sister.

1511
01:59:36,936 --> 01:59:38,228
What Veeraswamy,

1512
01:59:38,603 --> 01:59:43,519
though not born but for growing together
you are saying her as your sister.

1513
01:59:44,227 --> 01:59:48,018
Have you offered at least a sari in
all these years, we got separated?

1514
01:59:48,227 --> 01:59:52,643
You could not give anything from the house
of mother even when she was pregnant.

1515
01:59:52,810 --> 01:59:55,519
Do you still remember sister
and brother in law relations still?

1516
01:59:55,853 --> 02:00:01,435
She remembered you saying
my brother even while she was dying.

1517
02:00:02,685 --> 02:00:04,832
No idea where he came from,

1518
02:00:04,912 --> 02:00:07,143
but is bringing
back those who got separated.

1519
02:00:08,064 --> 02:00:11,268
Instead of telling what you know,
why are you fighting even here?

1520
02:00:13,267 --> 02:00:15,143
Hey son, I will tell.

1521
02:00:16,934 --> 02:00:20,155
That was 1953...

1522
02:00:20,806 --> 02:00:22,726
Grandpa, we do not have so much time.

1523
02:00:22,806 --> 02:00:25,851
Say from when you clapped
saying unity is strength.

1524
02:00:26,017 --> 02:00:29,240
Unity is strength...
- Unity is strength...

1525
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:32,092
Unity is strength...
Unity is strength.

1526
02:00:32,867 --> 02:00:37,535
We all celebrated a feast that day
in the happiness

1527
02:00:37,615 --> 02:00:39,850
of sending back
the Government people.

1528
02:00:40,766 --> 02:00:44,308
All should be the same as brothers.

1529
02:00:44,516 --> 02:00:47,350
Not should be but we will be.

1530
02:00:50,349 --> 02:00:52,100
Even this village should be
together like us.

1531
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:53,599
It will be.

1532
02:00:53,774 --> 02:00:55,558
Don't know what happened in that time.

1533
02:00:56,225 --> 02:01:01,182
The elderly men going in with hand
in hand came out with a knife stab each.

1534
02:01:06,349 --> 02:01:07,224
Hey...

1535
02:01:11,502 --> 02:01:15,765
Do not believe these Telugu guys,
kill them.

1536
02:01:19,223 --> 02:01:24,473
Hey, none of you be along with
these Tamili guys. Kill those idiots.

1537
02:01:39,763 --> 02:01:48,097
We together like brothers till
then got separated as enemies.

1538
02:01:49,305 --> 02:01:54,137
The fight starting that day is still on
and we are still fighting.

1539
02:01:55,554 --> 02:01:56,972
What exactly has happened
in that room grandpa?

1540
02:01:57,222 --> 02:02:02,471
No chance that the others know of
what happened in that room than those two.

1541
02:02:08,156 --> 02:02:08,882
Come guys.

1542
02:02:11,721 --> 02:02:12,846
Hey guys.
- Sir.

1543
02:02:12,929 --> 02:02:14,473
Where are you going leaving these all?

1544
02:02:14,553 --> 02:02:15,470
You too leave sir.

1545
02:02:16,878 --> 02:02:18,386
Rekha, keys...

1546
02:02:20,863 --> 02:02:22,470
You just give me the keys right?

1547
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:37,428
Hello.

1548
02:02:38,345 --> 02:02:40,055
Karthika, I tried a lot but am not
understanding

1549
02:02:40,135 --> 02:02:41,094
about the fights of this village.

1550
02:02:41,469 --> 02:02:42,719
I do not so much of time to make
your village people in agreement.

1551
02:02:42,844 --> 02:02:43,677
Please come along with me.

1552
02:02:44,177 --> 02:02:46,843
Hari, you do not understand my condition.

1553
02:02:48,094 --> 02:02:51,384
If I come with you, they would say your
girl eloped with a Telugu guy.

1554
02:02:52,302 --> 02:02:54,469
My whole family would hang and die.

1555
02:02:55,633 --> 02:02:56,804
No way, it will not happen so Karthika.

1556
02:02:56,884 --> 02:02:58,469
You say yes for once
and I will take you coming right away.

1557
02:02:58,594 --> 02:02:59,843
Do you not understand when I say?

1558
02:03:00,426 --> 02:03:02,635
I will not come leaving my family.

1559
02:03:18,931 --> 02:03:21,972
She is very unlucky girl...

1560
02:03:22,164 --> 02:03:23,972
Don't feel bad...forget her.

1561
02:03:24,994 --> 02:03:26,097
Hey, that is raw...

1562
02:06:21,839 --> 02:06:23,838
Son, about this village...

1563
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:25,330
Dear...

1564
02:06:26,546 --> 02:06:27,665
Hey, dear...

1565
02:06:34,088 --> 02:06:35,338
what is you and crying?

1566
02:06:37,109 --> 02:06:39,462
What son, come on hit.

1567
02:06:40,058 --> 02:06:40,880
Come on hit dad,

1568
02:06:42,330 --> 02:06:43,212
smile son.

1569
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:46,421
I am not getting a smile dad.

1570
02:06:49,295 --> 02:06:50,235
Hey,

1571
02:06:50,712 --> 02:06:52,837
I never saw you agreeing the defeat.

1572
02:06:54,170 --> 02:06:55,169
Do not agree even now.

1573
02:06:56,866 --> 02:06:59,711
I went through the revenue records
to know about this village fights.

1574
02:07:00,438 --> 02:07:02,212
Here, I found this information.

1575
02:07:03,044 --> 02:07:07,402
In 1953 half each from
the properties of the landlords

1576
02:07:07,482 --> 02:07:09,336
was transferred over to a same name.

1577
02:07:10,257 --> 02:07:11,274
See...

1578
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:30,085
Hey, stop!

1579
02:07:32,127 --> 02:07:33,427
I said stop!

1580
02:07:51,755 --> 02:07:53,349
Open the door!

1581
02:07:53,853 --> 02:07:55,417
Hello...
- Hello.

1582
02:07:55,693 --> 02:07:57,316
Hello...
- Hello.

1583
02:07:59,267 --> 02:08:00,750
Are you fine? Please come.

1584
02:08:00,952 --> 02:08:01,712
Hello.

1585
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:07,296
Brother, that Telugu boy
who came here that day had come,

1586
02:08:07,475 --> 02:08:10,708
looking at his force,
he seems may kill sir, brother.

1587
02:08:12,988 --> 02:08:17,041
Sir, that college boy hit us
and went angrily to master.

1588
02:08:17,330 --> 02:08:19,831
We are worried
what would happen to him, sir?

1589
02:08:24,415 --> 02:08:25,249
You...

1590
02:08:25,821 --> 02:08:27,730
Hey old man,
I have no time and no patience.

1591
02:08:27,810 --> 02:08:29,582
Say the answer correctly to what I ask.

1592
02:08:29,797 --> 02:08:32,125
Either you hesitate or say wrong,
I will break your head.

1593
02:08:33,214 --> 02:08:35,332
Why are equal halves of landlords
properties on your name?

1594
02:08:35,504 --> 02:08:36,623
Come on say...

1595
02:08:37,043 --> 02:08:40,290
Why did those two close till they came in
come out with stabs on body?

1596
02:08:41,411 --> 02:08:43,999
Say idiot, say what exactly happened
in this room?

1597
02:08:46,028 --> 02:08:47,659
Will you say or you
want me to break your head?

1598
02:08:47,739 --> 02:08:49,389
I will say, I will.

1599
02:08:54,436 --> 02:08:55,572
Bring the girl.

1600
02:09:06,921 --> 02:09:08,167
Blow the trumpets.

1601
02:09:25,871 --> 02:09:26,871
What happened?

1602
02:09:27,137 --> 02:09:28,872
Will you say or you
want me to break your head?

1603
02:09:29,122 --> 02:09:30,871
I will say, I will.

1604
02:09:32,579 --> 02:09:33,513
That day...

1605
02:09:33,593 --> 02:09:35,537
Come friend, come and sit.

1606
02:09:37,956 --> 02:09:40,121
Here is the drink of Lords you like.

1607
02:09:43,195 --> 02:09:46,578
There are the non veg items you like.

1608
02:09:52,554 --> 02:09:53,620
Diana.

1609
02:09:57,120 --> 02:10:00,411
Friendship means you dude,

1610
02:10:00,606 --> 02:10:05,620
not just for my tongue but you brought
Diana I like all the way from Britain.

1611
02:10:10,168 --> 02:10:12,083
What is Diana yours, mine?

1612
02:10:12,312 --> 02:10:14,160
Dude, what are you talking?

1613
02:10:15,371 --> 02:10:16,494
That is my girlfriend.

1614
02:10:16,577 --> 02:10:18,790
The English man gave freedom
to India while leaving.

1615
02:10:18,870 --> 02:10:20,452
and gave this babe to me.

1616
02:10:21,737 --> 02:10:23,118
What are you talking?

1617
02:10:23,198 --> 02:10:26,866
From five years, she is with me
for six months and the rest in London.

1618
02:10:27,553 --> 02:10:31,620
Go away, you idiot. London she
said is the name of my farm house.

1619
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:35,534
You fool, Britain you said
is the name of this bungalow.

1620
02:10:36,311 --> 02:10:41,138
Oh God! She played a game with us.

1621
02:10:41,385 --> 02:10:46,243
Whatever may be the game
she played, I need her.

1622
02:10:47,530 --> 02:10:49,705
Hey black and white,

1623
02:10:49,785 --> 02:10:53,055
ours is the combination dude.
She is mine and I need her.

1624
02:10:53,135 --> 02:10:54,700
Muthu, oh my baby.

1625
02:10:54,878 --> 02:10:57,186
No, she is mine and I need her.

1626
02:10:57,266 --> 02:11:00,465
No, I need her.
- Mine, I need her.

1627
02:11:00,545 --> 02:11:02,782
Muthu, why are you here?

1628
02:11:03,074 --> 02:11:06,566
See my wife dude,
she called me Muthu so cutely.

1629
02:11:08,663 --> 02:11:10,575
Come on Diana,
do not participate with both.

1630
02:11:10,655 --> 02:11:14,658
Tell me one, I or he?

1631
02:11:15,002 --> 02:11:17,074
You both are two eyes for me.

1632
02:11:17,574 --> 02:11:21,532
Oh no, it may be ok in your country
but is a sin here Diana.

1633
02:11:21,717 --> 02:11:24,491
Why are you doing if it is wrong?

1634
02:11:24,782 --> 02:11:26,324
You guys are already married.

1635
02:11:27,021 --> 02:11:29,574
Oh no, it is not the time
to talk about logics Diana.

1636
02:11:29,699 --> 02:11:32,296
I want you completely.
- Diana is mine, idiot.

1637
02:11:32,376 --> 02:11:35,531
No, she is mine. - Diana is mine.
- Don't fight, please. Don't fight.

1638
02:11:38,067 --> 02:11:39,448
Diana...

1639
02:11:41,740 --> 02:11:42,748
Go idiot.

1640
02:12:05,538 --> 02:12:07,572
What, are you fighting for this?

1641
02:12:07,946 --> 02:12:11,322
So many wars took place for a lady
and this is one from them.

1642
02:12:14,872 --> 02:12:16,154
How do you know this matter?

1643
02:12:16,391 --> 02:12:19,363
A small kid is playing
in that photo frame right?

1644
02:12:25,249 --> 02:12:26,488
I am that kid.

1645
02:12:26,738 --> 02:12:27,904
She is Mummy.

1646
02:12:28,105 --> 02:12:29,387
Still, that kid is an English kid right?

1647
02:12:29,467 --> 02:12:31,613
You know about the summer here
in Tamilnadu right?

1648
02:12:32,036 --> 02:12:33,070
I became dark.

1649
02:12:33,702 --> 02:12:35,113
How did you become a landlord?

1650
02:12:35,193 --> 02:12:40,528
They both had 1000 acres and my mom
made them write 500 each on my name.

1651
02:12:41,424 --> 02:12:45,237
Only 500 is left for them. I
became the landlord with that 1000 acres.

1652
02:12:45,482 --> 02:12:47,112
Fights in the village would have stopped
if this was said out, right?

1653
02:12:47,305 --> 02:12:49,444
How could I say that my mom was such?

1654
02:12:53,534 --> 02:12:54,889
Take out the proofs.

1655
02:13:21,485 --> 02:13:23,610
Hey, you be outside and I will take care.

1656
02:13:23,985 --> 02:13:25,818
I will take care, go.

1657
02:13:25,943 --> 02:13:27,276
Get away, go.

1658
02:13:55,481 --> 02:13:58,941
You turned the personal fight of your
grandpas into a Tamil and Telugu fight.

1659
02:14:00,336 --> 02:14:01,608
If the villagers get to know about this,

1660
02:14:01,765 --> 02:14:03,306
whole village will be on one side

1661
02:14:03,386 --> 02:14:05,127
and you both families would be
exiled on to the other side.

1662
02:14:08,516 --> 02:14:10,982
There is no other option,
you both should come together.

1663
02:14:12,556 --> 02:14:13,815
You should give your
daughter to me in marriage.

1664
02:14:16,062 --> 02:14:19,232
Kesava, is it required to take off
the prestige of the dead?

1665
02:14:21,816 --> 02:14:24,440
Will you ask for forgiveness
or go away from the village?

1666
02:14:29,148 --> 02:14:32,690
Hey Muthu, where would you get
a better son in law than this?

1667
02:14:34,272 --> 02:14:36,147
Muthu, ask for forgiveness.

1668
02:14:36,397 --> 02:14:39,606
We know what to do.
Shut your mouth, you idiot.

1669
02:14:52,022 --> 02:14:56,855
I am giving the word at same place
where our grandfathers fought to death.

1670
02:14:57,487 --> 02:14:59,438
No more fights in between us now.

1671
02:15:02,356 --> 02:15:06,313
As a proof for this I am giving my
daughter in marriage to this Telugu boy.

1672
02:15:07,114 --> 02:15:11,191
Unity is strength...
Unity is strength.

1673
02:15:11,271 --> 02:15:13,418
Unity is strength...
Unity is strength.

1674
02:15:13,605 --> 02:15:15,341
Unity is strength...
Unity is strength.

1675
02:15:15,551 --> 02:15:18,857
Unity is strength...
Unity is strength.

1676
02:15:30,666 --> 02:15:31,769
Hey dear.
- Yes.

1677
02:15:32,076 --> 02:15:33,687
Have you seen how my idea worked out?

1678
02:15:34,145 --> 02:15:35,939
When he was put at a place full of fights,

1679
02:15:36,019 --> 02:15:38,937
he stopped his fights and brought
the villages in fight together.

1680
02:15:39,239 --> 02:15:40,728
That is the...

1681
02:15:46,103 --> 02:15:47,118
Hello...

1682
02:15:47,685 --> 02:15:51,486
You had been enjoying our property all
these years and again commanding on us?

1683
02:15:52,182 --> 02:15:53,769
I will teach him a
lesson after the marriage.

1684
02:15:54,189 --> 02:15:56,143
None here can open their mouths.

1685
02:15:56,551 --> 02:15:59,238
Because whoever opens up his mouth,

1686
02:15:59,318 --> 02:16:01,477
story of us three would be
known to the villagers.

1687
02:16:02,112 --> 02:16:03,436
and they would spit on our faces.

1688
02:16:03,727 --> 02:16:07,251
So, let us continue like before.

1689
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:11,809
Ok, what about the condition of
our revenge guy?

1690
02:16:11,892 --> 02:16:15,060
Oh, grandma changed after kidnap.

1691
02:16:15,140 --> 02:16:17,184
She said would take care of him.

1692
02:16:17,565 --> 02:16:18,656
No idea what she did?

1693
02:16:26,476 --> 02:16:27,559
One minute.

1694
02:16:31,955 --> 02:16:32,725
Dad...

1695
02:16:33,925 --> 02:16:35,434
Oh no...

1696
02:16:40,641 --> 02:16:41,558
Oh no...

1697
02:16:41,875 --> 02:16:44,391
I cannot anymore
and you got to change the tings.

1698
02:16:45,173 --> 02:16:47,683
No need,
they have changed the groom itself.

1699
02:16:47,850 --> 02:16:49,183
What are you talking idiot Rutherford?

1700
02:16:49,506 --> 02:16:50,387
If the groom has motions,

1701
02:16:50,467 --> 02:16:52,225
time should be changed
but what is changing the groom?

1702
02:16:52,418 --> 02:16:53,140
We should take the options.

1703
02:16:53,220 --> 02:16:54,553
Let us do...
- Let us do.

1704
02:16:54,933 --> 02:16:56,129
Come on.

1705
02:17:03,099 --> 02:17:04,240
Oh God!
