Seeing my beauty the groom will faint

KAKINADA 25Km

16
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:12,167
Hail lord Rama!

17
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:15,667
Uncle! Why have you brought me with you in the early morning?

18
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,033
-What is the urgency? -How do I know?

19
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,133
Your dad called me around 12am,..

20
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,966
..and ordered that you must be present at 6 am.

21
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:25,832
I asked, ëwhat is the newsí?

22
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,099
He said, ëwonít you bring her if I donít tell the newsí..

23
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:33,466
..and scolded my family members and the people of my lineage.

24
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:36,066
What is the secret news even without your knowledge of it?

25
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,633
Lord Rama! I promise on your aunty.

26
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,367
-Keep quiet uncle! -Take back your promise.

27
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:42,666
I know. You wonít leave me, all of a sudden.

28
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,932
Oh gosh! Today is my second term internals.

29
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:47,067
I am missing it.

30
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,432
I donít know about this suspense.

31
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,766
Uncle! Why are they decorating all over the street?

32
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,432
-I am too thinking the same. -Whose marriage would it be?

33
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,266
-Whose marriage? -Itís Kasthuriís marriage..

34
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:04,633
Last month was her engagement!

35
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,167
That is the reason for this surprise.

36
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:08,000
Why is some busy work going on in our house?

37
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:09,766
Is your father getting married again?

38
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:14,733
-What would be the reason for it? -You idiot!

39
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,466
Because I married your sister, your father left you too with me.

40
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,966
You are irritating me for 20 years.

41
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:23,699
-It is calling ëYellí -Damn yell.

42
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:25,600
Brother-in-law! Why do you hit me for everything?

43
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,000
Bujjamma! Brother-in-law! Bujjamma has come.

44
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,966
-What is this? -Dear! You are going to get married.

45
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,333
-Your father brought a nice alliance. -Keep the luggage in.

46
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,500
Come in.

47
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:42,167
Donít make them stay out. Bring them in and talk to them.

48
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:45,132
Bujjamma! Stay there.

49
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,867
He says the groom is a nice person. He stays in America.

50
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:52,600
Didnít we attend a marriage function.. ..of Suryanarayanaís daughter before 3 months at Rajamundry?

51
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,633
I heard now, she stays in America.

52
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:57,432
Her husband and the groom are good friends.

53
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:58,233
Spit here.

54
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,266
He saw you in her marriage cassette at her house.

55
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:07,699
-He wants to marry you only. -You keep quiet.

56
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,167
You know, he made his parents to agree for this marriage.

57
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:12,067
Is it over?

58
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:18,333
Move aside. Let her take a breathe.

59
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:20,533
Let her take some rest.

60
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:24,800
Otherwise sheíll sleep in the marriage hall at night.

61
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,033
-Is my marriage at todayís night? -Yes.

62
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,567
It is said that marriage proposal and vomiting canít be stopped.

63
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,667
Your marriage will be held on todayís night.

64
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:33,266
You will be staying at our home for three nights.

65
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,867
And other three nights you will be staying at his home.

66
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:41,833
On 7th day he will take you to America with him.

67
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,466
Then Amalapuram girl will become American girl.

68
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,567
-Come for a minute. -She feels shy.

69
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:53,567
You are very lucky dear. I am not saying..

70
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:57,067
..but aunty, have you seen in TV about NRI marriages?

71
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:00,399
Ramaraju fixed an America alliance for his second daughter.

72
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:04,367
-He is torturing her cruelly. -She looks dull, aunty.

73
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:06,199
But my dear looks pretty.

74
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,367
Why do I need this marriage now?

75
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:11,132
Then when will you get married?

76
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,633
Now you are 20years old.

77
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,566
Do you know, I got married at the age of 14?

78
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,467
Well said!

79
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,466
-Donít I want to continue my studies? -No problem.

80
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:20,632
If your would-be accepts, you can continue your studies after marriage.

81
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,167
You all are making me..

82
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,632
What is this, youíve brought me at midnight and conducting my marriage.

83
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,932
-Oh gosh! If your dad listens.. -Donít I want to be prepared mentally?

84
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,100
Shouldnít I know about that American groom?

85
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,766
Shouldnít I atleast see that groom?

86
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:36,567
Hey! Bring here those DVDís.

87
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,899
Where is he staying, what job is he doing..

88
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,900
how much is he earning, everything he is..

89
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,667
-Here it is aunty. -Ok, you go..

90
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,766
He recorded everything in this DVD and sent it for you.

91
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:52,266
Do you know how beautiful your house is in America?

92
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:55,067
Prince wants to marry you. Donít say no.

93
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,932
Is that Prince in it?

94
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,099
Idiot!

95
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,966
He saw me in CD, so should I see him in this DVD?

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Should we run our family through Internet?

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,766
I donít want this marriage.

98
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:15,333
Are you in love with anyone in Kakinada?

99
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Iíll kick you.

100
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:19,733
I know, you are very strict.

101
00:07:20,432 --> 00:07:21,500
Do you know one thing?

102
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:25,199
Your name is Sasirekha and his name is Abhimanyu.

103
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,300
See! Your names are matching similarly.

104
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,132
-Your horoscope too is matching similar. -You..

105
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,666
Do you feel headache?

106
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,966
I donít want this marriage.

107
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:42,100
I donít want this marriage.

108
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,066
Why are you acting like a smart?

109
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,166
Iíll peel your skin out. Come here.

110
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,066
What is your opinion?

111
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,666
Will you get married after roaming with someone for 6 months..

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,932
..and get pregnant by him? Do I look like a crazy thing?

113
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,099
Iíll kill you.

114
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:00,733
Move aside.

115
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:03,099
You both together spoiled her, isnít it?

116
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,500
When I asked, why should a girl be allowed to study..

117
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,166
You said, ëbrother, days have changedí..

118
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:09,866
..nowadays all girls are educating themselves.

119
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,833
..I am a guarantee for her, and made me accept..

120
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,432
you took her to Kakinada and spoiled her.

121
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,399
See! Now what is she saying?

122
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,567
She say, she doesnít want this marriage. Now whom do I arrange as a bride?

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,300
-How dare you talk against his speech? -Go away.

124
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,532
-Donít you want this marriage? -Donít get angry. She is innocent.

125
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:25,266
Come this side.

126
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,166
I am telling politely,.

127
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,266
..itís ok if you sit in the marriage hall at night..

128
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,500
Otherwise Iíll kill you and make you lie down on a bier.

129
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:40,600
-Brother-in-law! -Go away. You oldie.

130
00:08:56,232 --> 00:09:02,732
Donít know why my soul doesnít accept!

131
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:10,299
And it couldnít tell the reason.

132
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,900
It worries..

133
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:18,233
It gets emotional..

134
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:25,200
We both have the same feelings.

135
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:32,732
If it shares worries, burden would get reduced..

136
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:21,866
The green garden doesnít look nice at present.

137
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:29,332
The whole village praises but their looks pierce me.

138
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:58,832
It doesnít stay quiet. I donít know why.

139
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,500
Take it as either wrong decision or wrong path..

140
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:10,166
Nevertheless, it canít be changed.

141
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:16,432
Still itís making me thinking on..

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,200
And itís making me move out..

143
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:27,266
Brother-in-law! Groomís people have come.

144
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:29,500
-Your in-law has come. -Gosh! You are a crazy person.

145
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:30,899
Donít know how he speaks? I am coming.

146
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:33,100
Dear! Groomís people have come.

147
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:37,599
This house looks like Gannavaram govt. hospital.

148
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,733
Is this the house for guest to stay?

149
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,500
-In-law! -Why are you getting down slowly?

150
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,333
Are you getting down from a bus or a flight?

151
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:48,567
-In-law! -Are you here?

152
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:51,799
I thought you would welcome us in the village outskirts with a band.

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,232
Godhavari people know well about customs.

154
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,232
We thought to come there.

155
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,332
Donít drink all types of water. We Vijayawada people donít like it.

156
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,000
He would have arranged bislery water for us.

157
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,432
We couldnít get bislery water.

158
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:05,700
We got Godhavari river water for you.

159
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:07,700
Krishna people donít like Godhavari water.

160
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:09,299
-Did they mix endrine in that water? -You fool!

161
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:12,667
Didnít he accompany your wife when he visited my home?

162
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,799
Would you try to do something foolish to my son?

163
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:17,799
Your son need not worry about that problem.

164
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:20,432
-He has only one daughter. -You saved my life.

165
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:24,000
Will your people talk by making guest stand at the door steps?

166
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:26,199
-Come in in-law! -Take them inside.

167
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:29,932
Seems this house has no enough space to stay for our guys..

168
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,466
..my sonís friends have come from America. Where will they stay?

169
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,700
There are lot of A/c. rooms inside the house.

170
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:34,932
What about electricity here?

171
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,700
-Itíll come at 2 Oíclock. -Didnít you arrange for generator?

172
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,466
-Yes, we arranged 2 of them. -What about diesel for that?

173
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:42,067
Our person is standing in the queue. Whenever he gets it, heíll bring here.

174
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,032
Thatís why I told you..

175
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,800
..Iíll conduct this marriage in my place with my expenses in a grand way.

176
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:49,799
What did you say?

177
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,167
You said that itís my daughterís marriage..

178
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,033
..so it should be held in my house at my place.

179
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:56,500
My son got adamant to marry your daughter.

180
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,233
You both tied my hands.

181
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,732
-Dear! Keep quiet! -Yes, Iíll keep quiet!

182
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,133
In-law! Whatever we do, is it not for our childrenís good?

183
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:04,132
-Thatís right. -Come, letís go in.

184
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:07,133
As per the custom youíve to taste a sweet.

185
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:10,666
Ok. Why do you stand as a post here?

186
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,399
-Go and do the formalities to everyone. -Go dear.

187
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:17,232
Leave your customs, what about the money(dowry)?

188
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:19,899
-What money? -Donít you give me the balance money?

189
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,867
Weíll give you in marriage hall at the evening.

190
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:26,932
I canít say if you or I would be alive till the evening.

191
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:28,867
But this marriage shouldnít stop.

192
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:32,199
Thatís why, stop coming after me.

193
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,067
Go and get ready the money.

194
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:40,033
Then weíll celebrate, not only the mouth but the entire body.

195
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,466
Sister! Brother-in-law asked me to get the balance amount.

196
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,233
-What happened? -Wonít you give if I donít say the reason?

197
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,900
He made him stand outside till now.

198
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,632
He talked foolishly at him.

199
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,800
He says that this marriage wonít happen if you donít give them the total money.

200
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,667
And groom wonít marry her. He is crazy after money.

201
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,133
What are you looking? Get the money.

202
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,466
-Take it. -Dirty idiots!

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,966
Do you know how he abused him?

204
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,467
Sister! This alliance doesnít match us.

205
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:09,267
Did you hear it?

206
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,633
He doesnít want to marry me if he doesnít get the money.

207
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,100
He wonít take me with him if he doesnít get the money tomorrow.

208
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:16,000
Then, without getting money he wonít..

209
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:17,533
Do you understand what will it be?

210
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,566
You keep quiet! Iím feeling worried about it.

211
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,932
Mom! Do you want to get rid from me on some reason?

212
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,932
Am I burdening you much?

213
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:34,699
-Machine? -What machine? -It counts money.

214
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,366
Nowadays rich people are using it in our place.

215
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,767
-You know itís all bank bundles. -Donít I care in myself?

216
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:44,100
Uncle! Close all the doors. Nowadays cameras are fixed at windows.

217
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:45,932
What about the land documents?

218
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:47,567
Look! Itís there.

219
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,200
-All documents are being perfect. -Accounts are too perfect, sir.

220
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:09,500
-Take the 3rd note from the bundle. -Sir. -Take it out.

221
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:12,032
-Here it is sir. -What is it? -Is it torn?

222
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,100
Why did you give me torn note?

223
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:17,832
-I thought itíll happen like that. Take it. -Take it in-law.

224
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:22,567
-In-law! Give me sweet now. -Sit down.

225
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:24,866
-Is it jack fruit. -Have it.

226
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,667
Groom is a nice person. Thatís why I want to keep quiet.

227
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:29,932
Did you see him? He collected everything without missing.

228
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,966
How would my daughter live happily in his home?

229
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,832
We donít want to worry about his behavior.

230
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:35,866
We will meet him again in his life..

231
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:40,667
..2 or 3 times for babyís birth and his naming ceremony.

232
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:43,166
Let it be, but our dear wonít stay in his home, isnít it?

233
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,366
She will stay in America. Also groom is a smart person.

234
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,832
You know how smart he is..

235
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:50,067
Though he was born in Vijayawada, he doesnít know how to play cards.

236
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,667
-Doesnít he know how to play cards? -That is the wonder.

237
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,432
-Brother-in-law! -Baranam is torturing me.

238
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,632
-Itís Aranam, not baranam. -You keep quiet.

239
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:58,567
-Brother -in-law! -What?

240
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:01,599
-Our Bujjamma... -What Bujjamma?

241
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,667
Our Bujjamma ran out.

242
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:08,900
Iíll kill you.

243
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,500
Has she ran out herself or did you send her out?

244
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,932
Why do you stand still here like a post?

245
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,133
Go and find her out.

246
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:16,232
Go, search her and bring here.

247
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:18,599
Now what answer should I tell him?

248
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:22,366
-He is a talkative and a crazy person. -Stop.

249
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:28,899
What in-law? Has your daughter run out? ..with whom?

250
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,367
Does he belong to your caste?

251
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,632
-Good care. -Dear! Keep quiet.

252
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:35,867
I said no.

253
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:40,100
But you and your son made me to agree for this girl.

254
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,432
What? Do you feel happy now?

255
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,467
Come all of you. I donít know what Iíll hear, if I stay here further.

256
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,233
We bought this sari for your daughter. Give it to a beggar girl.

257
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:51,533
If I donít bath in Krishna river, this distress wonít leave from me.

258
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,266
He is going to leave this place.

259
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,400
If he leaves this village, there wonít be any relation between us.

260
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:58,466
Ask him about our dowry.

261
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:04,432
Seems he got crazy when her daughter ran out.

262
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,299
You idiot! I am not crazy.

263
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:07,732
Give my money and move.

264
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,099
Donít you feel ashamed? Why do you keep his money still with you?

265
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,067
Look! Your land documents are also in that.

266
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,666
Wait. How will give me the balance amount?

267
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,600
What balance amount?

268
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,700
I asked about 25 lakh rupees what you got from me in the engagement.

269
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,767
Is that? As soon as I reach Vijayawada, Iíll send you.

270
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:23,866
-Wait. -Who knows that you will be alive or not before you reach Vijayawada?

271
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,000
Give money and leave the place.

272
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:28,000
Wonít you let us go forward if we donít give you the money?

273
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,767
-Thrash him -Finish him.

274
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,466
-How dare you hit my sir? -Iíll kick you idiot.

275
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,266
Do I look like colorful shirt person?

276
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:37,200
If you donít give the money, Iíll dip you in Godhavari..

277
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,167
..then youíll float in the sea. You and your damn laugh.

278
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:41,932
Stop your laugh and look this side.

279
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,600
Colourful shirt? If anything bad happens, Iíll show you who I am.

280
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,833
Hello Murali! Itís me. I want 25 lakh rupees urgently.

281
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,333
Do you have only 15 lakh rupees. Send it fast.

282
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,766
Greetings Naidu sir! Do you have only 5 lakh rupees

283
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:03,833
Send it fast. Greetings Reddy sir! Send it fast.

284
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,467
I havenít moved an inch.

285
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:08,967
Iíll give you 25 lakh rupees and make a move.

286
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:28,899
Sir! Check the cash correctly.

287
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,900
I have faith in human.

288
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:35,099
No one can quarrels with me who knows well about me.

289
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,299
Coming down by my level which Iíve in vijayawada..

290
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:43,232
..I stepped into your village for the sake of my sonís happiness..

291
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:47,133
You have spoiled my remaining level by making me sit in this flour design.

292
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,799
I will never forget this and I wonít leave you.

293
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,733
My style is not giving an answer with slipper hit..

294
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:57,000
-Iíll hit you by section. -Daman section!

295
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:58,732
I donít know about those sections..

296
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,232
Iíll give answer only with slipper hits.

297
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,200
-Letís see. -Ok, letís see, go.

298
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:04,099
-Wait and see. -Ok, get out.

299
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,767
Come all of you. Big torture has left.

300
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,132
BEFORE 90 MINUTES

301
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,067
What is this without seeing..?

302
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:31,199
I am very sorry.

303
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,600
Will you hire me an auto to Hyderabad?

304
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:39,500
Has bride run out?

305
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:40,567
Madam! Watch out and walk.

306
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,100
Tell me clearly.

307
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,332
Get down fast. Will you drop me at the railway station?

308
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:55,567
Bujjamma, stop there.

309
00:19:57,932 --> 00:20:00,767
What is this? Listen to me.

310
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:03,467
-Bujjamma is seen. -Is Bujjamma seen?

311
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,733
-She is going in a bike. -Is she going in someoneís bike?

312
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,500
Who is that idiot? You make a call to Ram Babu.

313
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:09,500
Donít leave her. Follow her.

314
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,267
Drive slowly. There is heavy traffic.

315
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,400
-This bike is.. -I am very sorry.

316
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:15,432
-In some urgency.. -Itís ok with your urgency.

317
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,766
But this is not my vehicle.

318
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:17,799
Is it not yours?

319
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,700
Then why did you sit giving a big pose on it?

320
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:22,633
-It means.. -Have you stolen it?

321
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,633
-Have I stolen it? -Do you steal bikes casually?

322
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:27,400
-But you look so smart. -Do I look smart?

323
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,432
You are great.

324
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:30,032
Itís you who is running out from the marriage.

325
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,332
-Running out? -Then are you going to fashion show with this costume?

326
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:34,567
You are too great.

327
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,867
Ram Babu! Bujjamma was seen with someone at Dhavaleswaram.

328
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:39,666
Has she reached Dhavaleswaram so fast?

329
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,700
Is it fun for you when my daughter is roaming with someone..

330
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,500
and asking, has she reached Dhavaleswaram so fast?

331
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:47,700
Go and catch her before she does cross Godhavari river.

332
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:52,232
Where are we going?

333
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,466
Itís ok.

334
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,032
-Honda sir! -What happened again?

335
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,399
-I need your lift again? -Sit down.

336
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,633
-Bujjamma stop there. -Drive fast.

337
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:29,532
-They are your people. -Go forward.

338
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:37,567
Hello Bujjamma!

339
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:21,000
Once you glanced at me.

340
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:24,533
And made me stop my breath.

341
00:22:24,932 --> 00:22:28,000
You shot beauty arrows on me.

342
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:30,832
You killed me almost.

343
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:34,100
Donít know it is a magic or wonder..

344
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,666
What have you done to give me this new feeling?

345
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,200
Standing in front of me, you made me lost myself.

346
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:31,333
Oh dear!

347
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,067
My dear!

348
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:44,899
Yesterday I was happy!

349
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,500
Day before yesterday I was in joy!

350
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,866
But donít know what happened today

351
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:56,666
I feel air pecks and flowery bites.

352
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,700
Your reddish cheeks seem like vermilion.

353
00:24:04,232 --> 00:24:10,732
Itís filling aroma in merry thoughts.

354
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:13,666
I couldnít do it..

355
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:18,599
I couldnít control myself any longer..

356
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,099
When my thoughts seek you..

357
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:25,533
I canít bear it.

358
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:29,133
If you donít utter my name..

359
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,366
I hate my own name.

360
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,932
Not joining you in this my birth..

361
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:39,267
..is like Godhavari river without water.

362
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:27,375
Oh gosh! She fell in the river. I donít know swimming.

363
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:30,269
I am drowning.

364
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:33,980
I donít know swimming.

365
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,293
Seems he doesnít know swimming. Go and pull him out.

366
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,126
Buddy!

367
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:56,053
Look here!

368
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,103
-Turn your face once this side. -Weíll see you.

369
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,373
Oh gosh!

370
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:06,148
Donít kill me with your glance.

371
00:27:06,897 --> 00:27:10,490
Move fast. Idiot fellow!

372
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,256
He is lucky. Thatís why he got saved though he doesnít know swimming.

373
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:19,813
If you love her, you should get her consent by begging or doing something.

374
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:22,154
Did you jump into Godhavari for that? You fool!

375
00:27:22,305 --> 00:27:23,321
Not like that.

376
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,778
I was watching them.

377
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:26,946
They both eloped from their home..

378
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:28,584
After reaching here, misunderstanding began between them.

379
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,401
First she jumped then he jumped for her.

380
00:27:30,578 --> 00:27:31,587
Which is your native place?

381
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:33,567
-From Vijayawada! -Is it Vijayawada?

382
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:35,140
Have you come so far to die?

383
00:27:35,384 --> 00:27:36,788
Donít you have Krishna river there?

384
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,176
Why donít you try in that?

385
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:39,631
Get your parents permission and marry her.

386
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:40,627
My 10 rupees note got wet because of you.

387
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:41,863
If I go to my house, my wife will scold me.

388
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:43,482
Donít know what should I tell her

389
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,413
What dear? What do you want?

390
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:50,282
Is it a bag?

391
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:52,425
Why have you come alone?

392
00:27:52,787 --> 00:27:54,096
Didnít your family members come with you?

393
00:27:55,723 --> 00:27:56,593
Why do you bother?

394
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,375
-How much is this bag? -Around 300 rupees.

395
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:01,798
No credit and no bargain.

396
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:04,732
-How much is it? -Around 200 rupees.

397
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:07,654
Do you want cash or kiss?

398
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:11,018
What did you say?

399
00:28:12,346 --> 00:28:15,248
Do you want cash or kiss?

400
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,202
Everyone gives me cash. You give me that second choice.

401
00:28:24,846 --> 00:28:25,735
Itís cheating!

402
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:37,606
Stop it.

403
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,836
Boss! She is a superb figure.

404
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:45,423
She looks like cinema actress.

405
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:47,099
May be she will demand more money.

406
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:48,269
Then what? Will she come for free of cost?

407
00:28:49,137 --> 00:28:50,013
Thank you very much sir.

408
00:28:50,878 --> 00:28:51,657
What is the rate?

409
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:54,320
You tell.

410
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:57,086
When do your people listen our words?

411
00:28:58,698 --> 00:29:00,461
Gosh! I am new to this route.

412
00:29:00,785 --> 00:29:01,742
Itís first time for me.

413
00:29:02,092 --> 00:29:04,449
-What? Is it your first time? -Yes sir.

414
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:06,839
Buddy! Why have you changed the party?

415
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,002
Shut up and get down.

416
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:11,623
Look! Iíll give you 500 rupees. Is it ok for you?

417
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,799
-500 rupees? -500 rupees!?

418
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,451
You cry to give 200 rupees for me. You idiot.

419
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:17,990
Oops! You get down.

420
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,013
Look! Come and get in.

421
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:28,565
-I am not a girl of that sort. -Look! Here is a girl of virtue.

422
00:29:28,846 --> 00:29:29,744
You shut up.

423
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,165
Dear! Are you not of this sort?

424
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:36,669
If any girl stands alone in the road, everyone will think like that.

425
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:38,937
-You go to your home. -Ok sir.

426
00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:40,693
-You get in. -You have to pay 200 rupees extra.

427
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:41,767
Itís ok, get in.

428
00:30:01,395 --> 00:30:05,991
Donít kill me with your glance.

429
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:22,158
What? Why are you teasing this girl?

430
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:24,425
Then, should I tease you?

431
00:30:24,618 --> 00:30:26,424
-Do you know who I am? -Who are you?

432
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:28,018
I am a lady constable.

433
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:29,615
Shall I dry clean your bones putting you in jail?

434
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:32,393
-No sister! -Idiot fellows!

435
00:30:35,462 --> 00:30:37,644
Thank you very much. Who are you?

436
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:40,872
-I am not a constable. -Then who?

437
00:30:41,232 --> 00:30:42,986
I am working in a convent as a science teacher.

438
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,608
-Then how..? -If I donít say like that, they wonít listen.

439
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:51,355
Itís ok, who are you?

440
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:53,885
-I am from Hyderabad. -Is it?

441
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:55,656
I came to Rajahmuandry for a TV show.

442
00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:58,423
-There are no buses traveling in this route to Hyderabad, isnít it? -No bus?

443
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,708
There is a junction nearby. You can get a bus to Hyderabad there.

444
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,723
I am too going there. Come with me.

445
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,689
Thank you very much.

446
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:09,495
Is your name Sasirekha? My name is Mary.

447
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:12,574
-Greetings. -Look! Hyderabad buses will stop there.

448
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,019
They will give you ticket in the bus only.

449
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:16,362
Iíll accompany you till you get the bus.

450
00:31:16,436 --> 00:31:17,953
-Is it ok? -Thank you very much.

451
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,991
Shall we have some cold drink?

452
00:31:19,165 --> 00:31:20,155
I feel very thirsty.

453
00:31:20,722 --> 00:31:23,397
Brother! Give me 2 cold drinks. Itís very hot nowadays.

454
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:28,200
If any strangers offer you anything you shouldnít try to eat or drink.

455
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:32,241
No thanks. I am not feeling thirsty.

456
00:31:33,454 --> 00:31:35,736
Itís ok, Iíll give the change. Have it.

457
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,199
You can drink.

458
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,654
She is there. Stop and get down.

459
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:41,877
You idiot!

460
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:47,327
-Where is she? -Which girl?

461
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,056
The girl who talked to you till now.

462
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,365
Till now she was here.

463
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:52,137
-Suddenly she has disappeared. -Where would she go?

464
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:53,249
Who are you?

465
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,506
-She is my wife. -Your wife?

466
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:58,763
Do you have sense? Did you leave her alone?

467
00:31:59,009 --> 00:31:59,963
What a person you are?

468
00:32:03,636 --> 00:32:04,832
You idiot!

469
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:07,157
Brother-in-law! You donít worry! And donít make me worry.

470
00:32:07,346 --> 00:32:09,338
Donít scold me. Am I not saying that I will catch her?

471
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:12,262
The girl who ran out from the house is our girl.

472
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:13,573
She must be roaming around this place.

473
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,243
I heard that someone has seen her before an hour here.

474
00:32:15,415 --> 00:32:16,342
This is her photo.

475
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:21,692
Why do you still stare at it? Go and search her.

476
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:29,216
Brother-in-law!

477
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,443
Brother-in-law! I heard that she is in this junction.

478
00:32:30,746 --> 00:32:32,272
What is in your mouth? Speak loudly.

479
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:33,400
Here, some girl is..

480
00:32:33,698 --> 00:32:34,441
I asked you to search for my daughter..

481
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:36,821
..leaving that, what girl and what are you saying, you womanizer?

482
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:39,337
No, not like that. Didnít I quit everything already?

483
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:42,444
I donít know what you are going to do..?

484
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:45,471
You should search and catch my daughter and drop her at my house.

485
00:32:45,654 --> 00:32:46,230
Understood?

486
00:32:48,296 --> 00:32:48,864
This is my family matter.

487
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,455
Idiot! Donít discuss about it around that place.

488
00:32:50,592 --> 00:32:51,724
Already I have lost my prestige.

489
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:53,340
You crazy fellow!

490
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,269
Brother-in-law! What he said?

491
00:32:58,416 --> 00:32:59,544
Pour endrine into my ears.

492
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,242
-You crazy Bharanam! -He is Aranam, not Bharanam.

493
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,810
My troubles will vanish if I kill you.

494
00:33:09,023 --> 00:33:11,056
-Which is your native place? -Vijayawada sir.

495
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,735
So donít you belong to this surrounding.

496
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:16,015
-Isnít Vijayawada in this surrounding? -You are right sir.

497
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:24,000
She looks superb. What is her rate?

498
00:33:24,151 --> 00:33:25,662
Gosh! Whom do you think of me?

499
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:27,144
I am a civil contractor.

500
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:29,573
-Then, what is this? -Gosh! She is like my daughter.

501
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:32,259
She is missing.

502
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,320
Is she missing or has she run away?

503
00:33:35,942 --> 00:33:36,859
Yes, she has run away.

504
00:33:37,592 --> 00:33:38,500
I thought so.

505
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:41,340
-Have you seen her anywhere? -Yes, Iíve seen her. -Where?

506
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:42,867
Didnít you show me her photo just now?

507
00:33:44,493 --> 00:33:46,801
I wanted to offer a big amount who tells her whereabouts.

508
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:48,736
Are you getting so much income in your business?

509
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:50,488
-80% - 20% -80%?

510
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:51,653
Leave that issue.

511
00:33:51,928 --> 00:33:52,888
Tell me if you see her anywhere.

512
00:33:55,348 --> 00:33:56,404
I wonít tell you.

513
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,538
Shri Aakula Thathabbayi's only daughter..

514
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:18,668
..Aakula veera venkata naga sathya sayi Sasirekha.

515
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,717
(A)Bujjamma(Computer science).

516
00:34:22,998 --> 00:34:27,466
She is the bride who ran away from the marriage hall.. ..that which is going to happen in 4 hours.

517
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:32,978
Your uncle Shri Abbulu is searching sharply for you around this place.

518
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:34,538
-How my photo.. -Looks superb!

519
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,559
A bumper prize is offered to the person who gets her back to her relatives.

520
00:34:37,914 --> 00:34:42,553
-Contact the numbers.. -What? Are you blackmailing me?

521
00:34:43,427 --> 00:34:47,366
If I slap on your eardrum youíll get bleeding and die.

522
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,606
You are very smart.

523
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:56,113
-Will you kick my head? -I'll call your.. -No

524
00:34:57,432 --> 00:34:59,402

00:35:03,963 --> 00:35:06,105
-What? -I am sorry.

527
00:35:08,048 --> 00:35:09,530
You look pretty in anger.

528
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:12,458
-Why are you running away.. -It's none of your business.

529
00:35:13,226 --> 00:35:14,569
-Give my photo to me. -Any love affair?

530
00:35:16,128 --> 00:35:18,038
Will you tell me or should I call your uncle? Tell me.

531
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,415
We don't have a great wealth

532
00:35:25,856 --> 00:35:27,246
We are very poor people.

533
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:30,324
Because of financial problem,.

534
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:34,851
..my dad is conducting my marriage with a person who is getting third time.

535
00:35:35,523 --> 00:35:37,208
-Third time marriage? -Yes.

536
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:41,045
His first wife attempted suicide having oleander seeds.

537
00:35:41,612 --> 00:35:43,192
And his second wife eloped with someone.

538
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:47,037
My head has heated up. Now I want to sip a good coffee.

539
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:49,647
Ok, have you had anything in the morning?

Look! Already your uncle has gone from this place.

542
00:35:56,942 --> 00:35:58,619
There is none of them to recognise you here. Come.

543
00:36:00,155 --> 00:36:01,027
Come.

544
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,554
You idiot!

545
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,202
Oh God!

546
00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:10,809
Is it true that they are conducting your marriage with a person as his third?

547
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,132
Didn't they tell you anything about this marriage?

548
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:19,731
Is it the reason or do you have any love affair?

549
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,414
-What do you want sir? -What do you have?

556
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:41,927
Someone told that in this hotel idlies are tasty.

557
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,454
-Bring two plates idly. -One plate is enough!

558
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:46,760
To him. I don't want.

559
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:49,432
Why do you stare at me? Go and bring it.

560
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:51,270
-One plate idly. -Over acting.

561
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,742
It's ok, did you keep your jewels in the bag safely?

562
00:36:55,842 --> 00:36:57,464
Why don't you eat something? Don't you feel hungry?

563
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:01,471
How do you know about my details?

564
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:03,311
Has Abbulu uncle told you?

565
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,206
Why don't you give me my photo?

566
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:08,246
Why do you keep it with you?

567
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,430
I liked it. I'll keep it with me.

568
00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:19,217
Idlies are superb like you said.

569
00:37:20,128 --> 00:37:20,737

00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:27,350
Seems she feels very hungry. Ok, eat.

571
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:39,525
Gosh! Didn't you think that I am a thief.. ..I'll mix something in this food to steal your jewels?

572
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,132
My grandma told me that don't believe strangers.

573
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:46,023
Did your grandma tell you that everyone is a thief excepting your family members?

574
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,807
Wait a minute. I'll be back.

00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:54,831
I am in Rajahmandri. Tell me the news.

576
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,114
You idiot. Go and die.

577
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,246
Don't irritate me. I won't come now.

578
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,757
-Where is she? -She has gone. -Gone?

579
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:08,331
-Where is my bag? -Was it yours? -Yes.

580
00:38:08,742 --> 00:38:10,543
Stop there.

581
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,656
Where do you go without paying my bill?

582
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:13,500
-Listen to me. -Pay my bill first.

583

584
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,280
She ran away with my bag.

585
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:17,500
-I've seen things like this a lot. -Leave me.

586
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,619
First two person come. Then one by one you'll leave this place.

587
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:21,396
You are talking too much. Shut up.

588
00:38:21,762 --> 00:38:22,878
Pay my bill first. Then I'll keep quiet.

589
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:24,217
What should I do now? From where can I get now?

590
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:25,917
She ran away with my bag. What to do now?

591
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:26,747
What should I do now?

592
00:38:27,461 --> 00:38:28,833
Then shall I work here in an hour count like in America?

593
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:30,456
What? Will you work here?

594
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,639
Just now didn't I tell the list of breakfast? Tell it once.

595
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:34,148
What? Can't I say it? Is this a big issue?

596
00:38:09,632 --> 00:38:35,430
Idly, Vada, Poori, Match box..

597
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:39,126
Supplier's duty is not so easy as you think.

598
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:41,921
Everyone comes stylish and gives orders..

599
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:43,423
..then they'll eat and leave from here without paying the bill.

600
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,371
Shut up.

601
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,226
-Take it. -Don't quarrel with suppliers.

602
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,621
Didn't I give you my 15 thousand rupees watch? Take it and shut up.

603
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:51,606
Go away.

604
00:39:37,235 --> 00:39:40,914
If my heart bubbles up like Soda

605
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:48,439
..the whole body would shiver.

606
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:52,576
If coca cola comes up hissing from my eyes..

607
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:59,820
..happy views would appear.

608
00:40:02,494 --> 00:40:06,001
If I get a chance to swing in thunders..

609
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:10,201
Jealous clouds would descend to earth.

610
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:17,085
This joy won't be repeated. Don't ask again.

611
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:20,810
These water games invite me excitingly today.

612
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:28,206
Hearing lullaby from chicks sounds gives joy.

613
00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:32,149
How much should I bribe the child..

614
00:41:32,527 --> 00:41:36,353
..to teach me mischiefs?

615
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:39,780
Who can dare to match fishes..

616
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:43,998
..to explore the depths?

617
00:42:41,952 --> 00:42:49,063
Green fields surround these villages.

618
00:42:49,648 --> 00:42:56,388
With different colors it showers in the sky.

619
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:00,510
There is a beauty and here is pollen of a flower

620
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:04,438
In which side doves should go like honey bees?

621
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:08,088
To save wealth and happiness..

622
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,612
..there is only one birth for me in this earth.

623
00:43:39,155 --> 00:43:40,019
Gosh! Stop the car.

624
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:42,576
Is she caught? Kill that idiot girl.

625
00:43:42,782 --> 00:43:44,862
Keep quiet brother-in-law! How can we kill our own girl?

626
00:43:45,068 --> 00:43:46,690
Didn't you know how many times you run away from your childhood?

627
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,684
That's why people is calling you are a womanizer.

628
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,253
Listen! Take care of her and drop her at home safely

629
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:53,070
Understand?

630
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:57,362
-He is just acting. -You cheater, Bujjamma!

631
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:00,034
How are you? Is everything ok?

632
00:44:00,331 --> 00:44:02,074
Give my bag. What?

633
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:03,307
I want that bag.

634
00:44:03,456 --> 00:44:04,189
You talk to me and I'll get it back to you.

635
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:05,407
Why should I talk to you? -Do you know what she did?

636
00:44:06,552 --> 00:44:08,120
-Come, let's go that side and talk. -What about my bag?

637
00:44:08,827 --> 00:44:09,526
I'll get it back to you.

638
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:11,637
You come. Let's move aside and talk.

639
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:13,049
-Why do you push me? -Come. I'll tell you.

640
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:13,894
Why do you surround me?

641
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:15,391
Gosh! Will you hit me?

642
00:44:15,588 --> 00:44:16,721
-You just wait. -Don't touch me.

643
00:44:17,103 --> 00:44:18,336
You know Rajahmandry SP is my uncle.

644
00:44:19,153 --> 00:44:20,492
If I make a call to him, you'll be finished.

645
00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:21,429
Don't take the things so far.

646
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:23,430
I am her paternal uncle. Ask me what do you want?

647
00:44:23,572 --> 00:44:25,396
-Your Bujjamma has escaped. -What? -Look there?

648
00:44:26,922 --> 00:44:29,451
Oh gosh! She escaped again.

649
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:33,049
You cunning thief!

650
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,641
Stop there.

651
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:40,504
-Where will you go? -Leave me.

652
00:44:40,713 --> 00:44:42,826
Are you trying to escape with my bag and purse?

653
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:44,940
Do you know how that server scolded me?

654
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:46,671
Because of you I lost my 15 thousand rupees watch.

655
00:44:47,045 --> 00:44:48,052
My mom bought..

656
00:44:48,885 --> 00:44:49,694
Where is my money?

657
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:52,705
No sorry, what have you done with my money?

658
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:55,507
I bought dresses with it.

659
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:57,481
Did you buy dress with it?

660
00:44:59,184 --> 00:45:00,360
-I will you.. -Oh! My jewels bag..

661
00:45:01,177 --> 00:45:02,966
-Give it back to me. -I'll pawn these jewels and..

662
00:45:03,206 --> 00:45:05,440
Leave.. I said leave me. I'll get you into troubles.

663
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:06,498
-What do you want? -I don't want anything

664
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:09,711
-Do you want any kiss? -Kiss..?

665
00:45:10,548 --> 00:45:12,365
Have you come so far? I'll break your face.

666
00:45:12,748 --> 00:45:13,686
Make sits and ups.

667
00:45:14,784 --> 00:45:15,899
It's ok. I'll sell these jewels.

668
00:45:17,204 --> 00:45:18,058
Properly..

669
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:22,744
You should make it 100 times.

670
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:25,010
Why did you stop it?

671
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:26,071
Why do you stare at me?

672
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:28,599
If you give me any pose at me..

673
00:45:29,202 --> 00:45:29,726
Who is she?

674
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,087
She pulled my bag and teasing me.

675
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:33,577
Has she come to support you?

676
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:37,214
She'll make get you into jail and dry clean.

677
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:38,410
Isn't he your husband?

678
00:45:38,768 --> 00:45:39,894
Is he? No way.

679
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:40,802
-What did you.. -What you idiot?

680
00:45:41,215 --> 00:45:42,059
Why do you tease her?

681
00:45:42,344 --> 00:45:44,128
-Give her jewels to her. -Should I give it to her if I am instructed?

682
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:45,931
Do you know what she did? I'll slap you.

683
00:45:46,353 --> 00:45:47,211
Make whistle.

684
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,207
Make whistle. Police will come to save you.

685
00:45:52,077 --> 00:45:54,226
Who is this shaved head? What will he do now?

686
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:00,029
Go fast.

687
00:46:01,945 --> 00:46:03,161
Why don't you change the bike?

688
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:06,660
My bag.

689
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:17,976
Has she escaped? Didn't you say just now that she is caught?

690
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:20,536
She is caught. But when I turned back and looked at her, she disappeared.

691
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:21,716
Did she escape while you turned back?

692
00:46:21,856 --> 00:46:24,722
Didn't I say you that if she is caught, take care her?

693
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,085
Why did you turn back, you idiot?

694
00:46:28,264 --> 00:46:31,356
Even so you said that how many times Iíve ran away during my childhood.

695
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,658
I am asking you, with whose permission you turned back.

696
00:46:33,847 --> 00:46:34,786
Why should I get permission?

697
00:46:35,072 --> 00:46:36,891
I just turned back and looked at her..

698
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,586
Why did you turn back?

699
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:39,887
You idiot!

700
00:46:40,137 --> 00:46:42,682
-Did you let her go by getting some chain from her? -A chain?

701
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:46,146
Why did you turn back? Answer me.

702
00:46:46,414 --> 00:46:47,903
Seems everything is wondering me.

703
00:46:48,646 --> 00:46:50,663
I thought that you are a thief..

704
00:46:51,331 --> 00:46:54,106
And she was a school teacher.

705
00:46:54,909 --> 00:46:55,856
True cheating!

706
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,250
That's why we should care in ourselves.

707
00:46:58,978 --> 00:47:00,032
Are you telling me about philosophy?

708
00:47:00,313 --> 00:47:02,684
My jewels were safe till they were in my hands.

709
00:47:02,894 --> 00:47:05,009
She stole only from your hands.

710
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:06,646
There is no connection with me in this.

711
00:47:06,851 --> 00:47:09,076
You only should get my jewels back to me.

712
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:11,851
-Otherwise I'll see your end. -Oh gosh!

713
00:47:12,735 --> 00:47:13,606
Why are you telling like this?

714
00:47:13,782 --> 00:47:16,616
Then have you thought this village girl won't ask you anything?

715
00:47:17,143 --> 00:47:19,264
I finished BSc.computer science.

716
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:20,880
Do you know about Kakinada college?

717
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:24,929
You only should get my jewels back to me?

718
00:47:25,298 --> 00:47:28,023
Otherwise I'll yell and bring a mob.

719
00:47:33,744 --> 00:47:34,766
Where are you going?

720
00:47:35,224 --> 00:47:36,851
I want to file a complaint in the police station.

721
00:47:40,056 --> 00:47:40,748
Come.

722
00:47:42,516 --> 00:47:46,469
That's why elders told that girls shouldn't go alone outside.

723
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,759
-But you don't heed their words. -He has started.

724
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:52,737
My teacher says that a girl and a matchstick are similar things.

725
00:47:53,088 --> 00:47:56,353
Girl must stay in the home and the matchstick should be in the box.

726
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,969
If it comes out, it'll be fired.

727
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:04,586
When you walk along the road wearing costly jewels..

728
00:48:04,737 --> 00:48:06,731
..spectators would get tempt for it.

729
00:48:07,686 --> 00:48:09,348
They too would've become like that.

730
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:12,673
We couldn't find it anymore. They would sell it.

731
00:48:12,922 --> 00:48:14,920
-Would they sell? -Ask him how much is his share in that?

732
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:16,541
Take him to the court!

733
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,434
-Sir, what is this? -Do something.

734
00:48:18,603 --> 00:48:19,791
Won't you do anything if someone is robbed in day light?

735
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,914
Those are very costly..

736
00:48:21,123 --> 00:48:23,581
Still they couldn't solve the theft of Goddess Kanka Durga jewels.

737
00:48:23,802 --> 00:48:25,394
How then can he solve your problem.

738
00:48:25,608 --> 00:48:27,199
-She only should know about it. -Take him. -You come.

739
00:48:27,592 --> 00:48:28,731
Don't you try to do something?

740
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,023
-Tell me what to do? -Should I tell what to do?

741
00:48:31,336 --> 00:48:33,150
You don't want do anything. I'll do myself.

742
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,890
Look! I shot up everything in this camera cell phone till now what you said.

743
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:38,568
Give that camera to me.

744
00:48:38,804 --> 00:48:40,523
You can watch it in TV at 9 pm.

745
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:42,945
I beg you. I'll take your complaint.

746
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:44,281
And I'll get back your jewels. Just leave me.

747
00:48:44,532 --> 00:48:46,370
What did you say? Manguri, 7 sovereign jewels.

748
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:48,262
I'll get it back to you from wherever it is.

749
00:48:49,106 --> 00:48:49,942
Give me that camera.

750
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:51,427
Ask him not to show it in the TV.

751
00:48:54,335 --> 00:48:56,349
You handled him correctly. Stupid fellow!

752
00:49:00,257 --> 00:49:01,390
What happened to you?

753
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,694
Seems you can't get your jewels back by them.

754
00:49:04,447 --> 00:49:05,648
I don't know what to do.

755
00:49:06,646 --> 00:49:09,605
-Gosh! What about my jewels? -You don't worry.

756
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:11,969
Come here once.

757
00:49:13,027 --> 00:49:14,842
-Offer me a cool drink. -Are you instructing a policeman?

758
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:16,778
We became cheap to you. What would you like to drink?

759
00:49:16,936 --> 00:49:18,592
Mahesh Babu and I always drink Thumps up only.

760
00:49:19,152 --> 00:49:21,232
Do you want to know from where you'll get the stolen jewels?

761
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,086
Wasn't she look fair?

762
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:25,159
-And fat too. -Yes sir.

763
00:49:25,351 --> 00:49:26,060
Hadn't she whistled?

764
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:27,980
Then a shaved head person came in a bike.

765
00:49:28,192 --> 00:49:28,983
He is Kola.

766
00:49:29,186 --> 00:49:30,526
He is her second-setup.

767
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:32,362
Will you tell me where can we get him?

768
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:34,289
They sell girls in Hyderabad.

769
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,358
They sell motor vehicles, cycles and rickshaws at sore bazaar in Guntur.

770
00:49:37,768 --> 00:49:39,558
You're telling about the jewels..

771
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,945
.so they'll sell it in Raman shop which is beside to Kaleswara market in Vijayawada.

772
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:43,861
Shut up and listen to me.

773
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,010
Kaleswara market, Chintakayala ramana, Kola and black bag.

774
00:49:47,186 --> 00:49:48,214
Talk to SP uncle at once.

775
00:49:48,356 --> 00:49:50,224
I should get those jewels at the evening. 7 sovereign jewels.

776
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:51,958
I too will talk to SP uncle.

777
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:52,771
Go fast.

778
00:50:07,177 --> 00:50:07,989
What happened?

779
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,617
Diamond of my grandma's mother!

780
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:11,630
Necklace of my grandpa's mother!

781
00:50:12,126 --> 00:50:13,854
Gold chain links of my grandma!

782
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:15,876
Waist necklace of my mom!

783
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:18,606
Everything belongs to a generation old of 100 years.

784
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,231
7 sovereigns jewels too.

785
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,239
I don't have sense.

786
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:25,590
Why don't I leave everything in my house?

787
00:50:27,101 --> 00:50:31,410
I got confusion in a hurry.

788
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:35,422
I don't have brain.

789
00:50:35,954 --> 00:50:38,239
That's why my mom always tellsÖ

790
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:41,725
Öthat I am a crazy girl.

791
00:50:43,217 --> 00:50:45,535
I didn't heed my mom's words?

792
00:50:46,206 --> 00:50:47,226
I did a mistake.

793
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:55,193
Don't know how mush my mom will cry if she knows I lost the jewels?

794
00:50:56,652 --> 00:50:57,496
You don't cry.

795
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,036
It's not looking good when you're crying.

796
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:00,896
Didn't he gave us a clue about that thief?

797
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:02,925
I'll get your jewels back in the evening.

798
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:05,096
After getting the jewels you can go to your mom.

799
00:51:05,284 --> 00:51:07,072
-Don't cry. -I did a mistake.

800
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:09,612
How can I show my face to her?

801
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:11,173
Do you want to talk to her? Shall I make a call for you?

802
00:51:11,346 --> 00:51:14,514
Gosh! If my dad knows it, he'll kill her.

803
00:51:14,726 --> 00:51:16,278
Is it ok to you if your dad doesn't know it?

804
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:18,293
How is it possible?

805
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:20,519
I didn't think she will do like that.

806
00:51:21,677 --> 00:51:23,103
That Abbulu told me that he will call now.

807
00:51:23,311 --> 00:51:24,376
But there is no call and damn.

808
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,608
-Idiot! -Phone is ringing.

809
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,069
Greetings sir!

810
00:51:30,536 --> 00:51:31,712
Will you give the phone to Kanakam sister?

811
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:33,134
-Who is it? -You funny!

812
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,987
-Can't you recognize me? -Why don't you tell your name?

813
00:51:36,206 --> 00:51:39,152
-I am Sita Rathnam -Hold on the line.

814
00:51:40,407 --> 00:51:41,575
Some Rathnam is calling you.

815
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:43,476
This Bharanam is torturing me.

816
00:51:43,882 --> 00:51:45,292
-It's Aranam, not Bharanam. -Damn thing!

817
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:47,265
Veeru told that he has seen our Bujjam in the junction.

818
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:49,213
-Did he see her? Where? -She is going with someone..

819
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:51,837
Talk to her. It's your mom.

820
00:51:51,974 --> 00:51:52,993
Mom!

821
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,801
Why are you crying? What happened?

822
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:02,973
When I heard your voice, I felt crying.

823
00:52:04,313 --> 00:52:06,266
-Where are you now? -I am somewhere.

824
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:07,788
But I am happy.

825
00:52:10,108 --> 00:52:13,580
-A boy called Anand.. -What a boy?

826
00:52:14,282 --> 00:52:15,902
No, he is a good person.

827
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,240
But he has some craziness. That's all.

828
00:52:19,746 --> 00:52:20,645
Don't worry mom.

829
00:52:21,173 --> 00:52:22,663
I am going to Hyderabad.

830
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,826
Why Hyderabad. Come to home.

831
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:26,726
Listen to me and marry.

832
00:52:26,938 --> 00:52:28,776
I don't want a person who is marrying me for money.

833
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:31,030
Don't talk like that. Listen to your mom.

834
00:52:31,217 --> 00:52:31,916
Shut up mom!

835
00:52:33,047 --> 00:52:34,603
Don't tell anything to dad!

836
00:52:37,862 --> 00:52:38,568
Put the phone down.

837
00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:47,606
You are not an idiot like I thought.

838
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:07,175
Jesus! Get me back my jewels.

839
00:53:07,507 --> 00:53:09,817
If I get my jewels back, I'll offer you 100 coconuts.

840
00:53:10,561 --> 00:53:12,969
Oh lord Jesus!

841
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:33,978
Gosh! Jesus is drenching.

842
00:53:42,913 --> 00:53:43,630
Hold it.

843
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:13,235
Yes, what you said your name is?

844
00:54:13,413 --> 00:54:16,358
Anand? It's old name.

845
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:17,608
-It's not suitable for you. -Is it?

846
00:54:18,605 --> 00:54:19,592
-Which is your native place? -Vijayawada.

847
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:23,817
What is that reaction when I told Vijayawada?

848
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:27,818
-Isn't Vijayawada a native of Manohar who killed Sri Lakshmi? -Yes.

849
00:54:28,628 --> 00:54:34,123
Then. Someone poured acid on a girl in Vijayawada, isn't it?

850

And yesterday Ayesha is..

853
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:46,737
-Gosh! Hearing your Vijayawada name is violence. -Violence?

854
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:50,233
Did you think there is no work for Vijayawada guys other than killing girls?

855
00:54:50,605 --> 00:54:52,188
Only that idiot Manohar is in Vijayawada.

856
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:53,867
What do you know about Vijayawada?

857
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:00,045

918
00:57:18,474 --> 00:57:20,827
Who knows where would he have roamed before marriage?

919
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:23,920
-Uncle. -Dirty idiots! -Is it your mouth or rubbish box?

What is this? What a pity! Look! She is innocent.

922
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:29,902
She doesn't know anything.

923
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,975
Sasi! I didn't know that you have so much doubts on marriage.

924
00:57:32,164 --> 00:57:32,697
Then...

925
00:57:33,255 --> 00:57:37,605
Should get married, run a life, cooking, serving, do hose keeping,

926
00:57:37,847 --> 00:57:43,445
should take care of husband's relatives, make him happy, beget children

927
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,343
and should bring them up.

928
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:50,067
Even if he is a lazy person, she should do some job and feed them.

929
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:55,910
Actually what you said is right.

930
00:57:56,434 --> 00:57:59,186
Even so we should give dowry to him.

931
00:58:00,036 --> 00:58:03,710
-That's why I ran out. -Are they asking dowry in these days?

932
00:58:03,768 --> 00:58:08,913
-Yes, 50lakh rupees, 20 acres of land, jewels and formalities. -Is it?

933
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:13,680
That's why I escaped. So marriage has got cancelled.

934
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:15,494
I am a handsome person.

935
00:58:15,661 --> 00:58:17,340
-Bullock cart! -Sir! Stop the cart.

936
00:58:18,367 --> 00:58:19,225

00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:24,059
-Your bullocks look good. -Is it good?

939
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,872

00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,193
-Uncle! Shall I ride it? -Want to ride it? Hold it.

943
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:37,320
-Careful Sasi -Be careful dear!

944
00:58:38,132 --> 00:58:40,176
Be careful dear! Like that dear!

945
00:58:48,065 --> 00:58:49,931
Uncle! It is going very fast.

946
00:58:50,304 --> 00:58:52,316
Let it go. They have their own speed.

947
00:58:52,485 --> 00:58:55,189
-Uncle! We are getting defeated. -What defeated?

948
00:58:55,728 --> 00:58:57,645
-Uncle! It's a question of our prestige. -Do you think so?

949
00:58:57,827 --> 00:58:59,110
-Move it fast. -Then see.

950
00:59:04,706 --> 00:59:07,458
I beg you. I'll fall down.

951
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:09,271
Stop it Sasi!

952
00:59:09,534 --> 00:59:12,101
I feel giddy.

953
00:59:12,452 --> 00:59:16,036
Stop it. I'll fall down.

954
00:59:20,592 --> 00:59:29,068
-Uncle! We have won. -I feel giddy.

955
00:59:55,588 --> 00:59:57,889
Not like that. I'll..

956
01:00:02,306 --> 01:00:03,465
Stop.

957
01:00:05,163 --> 01:00:07,248
Who are you? Why are you coming like this?

958
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:15,771
Don't talk stylish.

959
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:19,951
We want one room.

960
01:00:30,565 --> 01:00:34,370

964
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:09,915
-Don't turn. -No, sorry.

965
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:11,555
I came to say thanks for the dress.

966
01:01:12,054 --> 01:01:13,407
You say thanks later. First you go out.

967
01:01:15,784 --> 01:01:17,722
Seems she has seen? Damn it.

968
01:01:19,626 --> 01:01:22,272
Have you come? Both of them are changing dress.

969
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:32,750
It's true that You won't leave me and go.

970
01:01:53,184 --> 01:01:54,742
-What Sasi? What happened? -Abbulu uncle.

971
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:57,934
What Sasi? Where are you going?

972
01:01:58,108 --> 01:01:58,913
Who are you?

973
01:01:59,684 --> 01:02:00,434
Where are you taking me?

974
01:02:00,605 --> 01:02:01,489
All, shut your mouth.

975
01:02:12,601 --> 01:02:13,902
-Careful! -Come.

976
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:15,663
-Watchout! -Idiot! Come.

977
01:02:16,206 --> 01:02:18,146
This is Bujjama's dress. Search her.

978
01:02:22,632 --> 01:02:23,230
Stop a minute.

979
01:02:24,025 --> 01:02:25,052
-Uncle! -Don't get worry.

980
01:02:27,862 --> 01:02:28,465
Where is she?

981
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,867
-Oh God! -They have not come here.

982
01:02:31,862 --> 01:02:32,455
Where?

983
01:02:34,264 --> 01:02:35,045
Oh God!

984
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:36,811
-You go that side. -Ok.

985
01:02:38,356 --> 01:02:39,173
I feel giddy.

986
01:02:40,847 --> 01:02:42,920
-Come fast -Oh God!

987
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,380
What is this?

988
01:02:56,748 --> 01:02:57,458
Oh god!

989
01:03:13,894 --> 01:03:15,900
My pant is slipping. Both of us will fall down.

990
01:03:17,105 --> 01:03:19,516
See, Pant is slipping.

991
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:27,324
Wait a minute!

992
01:03:35,076 --> 01:03:35,956
Careful!

993
01:03:41,393 --> 01:03:42,799
-Oh God! -How to go?

994
01:03:44,101 --> 01:03:45,416
You devil. Stop there!

995
01:03:45,802 --> 01:03:48,681
Uncle! Our Bujjama has escaped from here.

996
01:03:48,824 --> 01:03:50,637
Idiot! Don't tell your nuisance.

997
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:53,150
Uncle, battery is down.

998
01:04:08,998 --> 01:04:11,409
Would I surelyget my jewels in Vijayawada?

999
01:04:12,836 --> 01:04:15,802
I will get back your jewels by going in and around Vijayawada!

1000
01:04:17,056 --> 01:04:21,239
You are talking dialogues like Mahesh Babu in Thums up ad.

1001
01:04:22,248 --> 01:04:24,952
You couldn't stop even one car.

1002
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:26,695
Do you think it is so easy?

1003
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:28,384
You can understand if you stop one car.

1004
01:04:28,643 --> 01:04:29,812
-No. -What no?

1005
01:04:30,686 --> 01:04:31,679
You're doing too much.

1006
01:04:32,177 --> 01:04:33,594
You can try yourself. And know it!

1007
01:04:35,003 --> 01:04:38,048
Definitely next vehicle will stop by seeing me.

1008
01:04:58,617 --> 01:04:59,855
Boss! A damsel.

1009
01:05:02,996 --> 01:05:04,977
Will you drop me at Vijayawada?

1010
01:05:07,512 --> 01:05:08,632
Thanks. Anand!

1011
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,007
Both of us.

1012
01:05:14,364 --> 01:05:15,738
Bujjama, we don't want this vehicle.

1013
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,175
We shall go in next vehicle.

1014
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:19,047
Should you wait for next vehicle?

1015
01:05:19,393 --> 01:05:20,411
-Listen to me. -Shut up.

1016
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:41,769
Stop.

1017
01:05:46,324 --> 01:05:47,277
Stop.

1018
01:05:50,193 --> 01:05:50,758
Leave me..

1019
01:06:35,132 --> 01:06:36,148
Oh God!

1020
01:06:39,086 --> 01:06:40,076
Come fast!

1021
01:06:51,362 --> 01:06:52,197
Donít ask anything.

1022
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:10,465
Oh gosh!

1023
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,959
-Come fast. -He has come.

1024
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:55,315
How dare you hit me?

1025
01:07:56,059 --> 01:07:57,021
Better I kill you.

1026
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,304
I told they are not good people.

1027
01:07:59,547 --> 01:08:00,805
Without listen my words you are getting into the vehicle.

1028
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:03,900
So, who are you to hit me?

1029
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:04,735
Are you asking who I am?

1030
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:07,385
If I didn't come on time, the driver who brought you..

1031
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:08,798
..brought me..

1032
01:08:09,822 --> 01:08:12,173
If you didn't come on time, would the driver have raped me?

1033
01:08:12,423 --> 01:08:13,413
Damn!

1034
01:08:14,143 --> 01:08:16,853
He came like a hero and saved me.

1035
01:08:17,304 --> 01:08:19,466
Can't I save my life? He is after all..

1036
01:08:19,787 --> 01:08:23,206
If you had not come, I'd have killed that driver.

1037
01:08:23,409 --> 01:08:24,831
-Would you kill him? -What do you think about me?

1038
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:26,521
Shut up your mouth.

1039
01:08:27,454 --> 01:08:28,715
-You shut up your mouth. -I will hit..

1040
01:08:29,425 --> 01:08:30,134
How dare you hit me?

1041
01:08:30,457 --> 01:08:33,096
-Even my dad has not hit me? -That is your dad's mistake.

1042
01:08:33,345 --> 01:08:34,984
That day itself he should have beaten you.

1043
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:36,675
He didn't do it. Hence you became like a devil.

1044
01:08:37,762 --> 01:08:38,746
Don't talk about my dad.

1045
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,001
Then you go and roam in road. I'll come to know.

1046
01:08:42,537 --> 01:08:43,619
-What? -Speak respectfully.

1047
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:46,860
-Who are you to hit me? -Go away.

1048
01:08:47,506 --> 01:08:48,743
Beating a girl..

1049
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,154
..do you give a pose? -Look!..

1050
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,215
Damn! You go away.

1051
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:54,309
Men are like..

1052
01:08:54,492 --> 01:08:56,952
..they show braveness in front of girls.

1053
01:08:57,809 --> 01:08:59,309
That groom is also like you.

1054
01:08:59,952 --> 01:09:01,563
That's why my life became like this.

1055
01:09:02,242 --> 01:09:03,655
Finally you are..

1056
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:04,726
I have to tell that.

1057
01:09:04,864 --> 01:09:06,385
After I met you, I got these trouble

1058
01:09:07,298 --> 01:09:09,511
No one begged you to be here.

1059
01:09:09,752 --> 01:09:12,011
You are following me without shy.

1060
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:19,671
Where are you going?

1061
01:09:20,028 --> 01:09:22,527
You can go only after you get back my jewels.

1062
01:09:22,893 --> 01:09:24,724
I won't bother if you die after that

1063
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,658
It is a path for everyone to walk..

1064
01:09:42,842 --> 01:09:45,850
Why has it became the forest?

1065
01:09:46,461 --> 01:09:49,626
Shadow, which comes as a friend..

1066
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:53,500
..why does it blame me?

1067
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:16,101
Why does my mind behave like an unknown enemy..

1068
01:10:24,546 --> 01:10:34,485
Why it provokes me and agonises me?

1069
01:10:34,788 --> 01:10:40,985
Don't know how to understand this separation?

1070
01:10:41,574 --> 01:10:48,936
May be it knows, but couldn't reveal itself.

1071
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:20,863
Donít know why my soul doesnít accept!

1072
01:11:21,496 --> 01:11:28,682
And it couldnít tell the reason.

1073
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:33,222
It worries..

1074
01:11:33,636 --> 01:11:36,975
It gets emotional..

1075
01:11:37,163 --> 01:11:40,130
We have the same feelings.

1076
01:11:40,733 --> 01:11:52,244
If it shares worries, burden would get reduced..

1077
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:10,862
-Quick! -Brother!

1078
01:12:11,042 --> 01:12:12,758
Gopalakrishna has sent a court notice.

1079
01:12:12,936 --> 01:12:13,567
Court notice?

1080
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:15,109
What is court notice?

1081
01:12:15,427 --> 01:12:16,376
That too non-bailable warrant.

1082
01:12:16,588 --> 01:12:18,083
What is non-bailable warrant?

1083
01:12:18,854 --> 01:12:21,770
Why are you turning your face? Answer him.

1084
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:26,637
That Gopalakrishna's dignity has got hurt by you..

1085
01:12:26,823 --> 01:12:28,206
..because you've cheated him by not giving your daughter to his son in marriage

1086
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:29,045
That means..

1087
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:34,859
That means if you don't appear within 24 hours in Vijayawada court..

1088
01:12:35,047 --> 01:12:36,068
If we don't attend?

1089
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,469
If we don't attend what will happen?

1090
01:12:39,038 --> 01:12:42,278
That means? Else you will go to Vijayawada jail.

1091
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:44,248
Uncle, jail?

1092
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:50,649
He thinks that I always laugh.

1093
01:12:51,118 --> 01:12:54,208
I will show that there is a tiger behind my laughing.

1094
01:13:25,595 --> 01:13:26,551
-Here. - Hi brother!

1095
01:13:26,795 --> 01:13:28,061
Come here.

1096
01:13:37,217 --> 01:13:39,150
-Who is he? -Have you got all the jewels?

1097
01:13:39,324 --> 01:13:41,804
-I got all jewels because of SP's personal interest. -Give the bag.

1098
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:43,206
We have to tell more thanks.

1099
01:13:43,623 --> 01:13:46,199
My jewels!

1100
01:13:51,653 --> 01:13:52,369
This girl..

1101
01:13:52,965 --> 01:13:55,867
-Check your jewels. -Brother, no this girl.

1102
01:13:56,555 --> 01:13:57,275
Nothing.

1103
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,335
He is my brother. He is my cousin.

1104
01:14:00,497 --> 01:14:02,094
No brother. Listen to me.

1105
01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:03,662
-I know this girl. -Shut up your mouth.

1106
01:14:04,225 --> 01:14:05,634
Why have you drenched your dress?

1107
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:07,414
Come. We will wash the dress.

1108
01:14:10,903 --> 01:14:12,045
I can't understand.

1109
01:14:12,288 --> 01:14:14,063
-This girl is the one you saw at America in a video.. -I know that.

1110
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,935
Aakula Veravenkata Nagasathyasai Sasirekha.

1111
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:18,218
Alias Bujjama.

1112
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:20,130
I too know that. But..

1113
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:24,548
Had everything been done correctly, I would've married this girl before 2 days.

1114
01:14:24,738 --> 01:14:26,494
Yes. If she had not been eloped..

1115
01:14:26,881 --> 01:14:27,496
Idiot!

1116
01:14:27,704 --> 01:14:29,302
No, she has not eloped.. but she has fled.

1117
01:14:30,109 --> 01:14:34,237
She got worried about the marriage. That's why she fled.

1118
01:14:34,814 --> 01:14:36,229
I can't understand anything.

1119
01:14:36,569 --> 01:14:37,424
This girl and you..

1120
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,610
What happenned is..

1121
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:43,050
All these are my dad Gopalakrishna's drama.

1122
01:14:43,672 --> 01:14:45,317
He knows that I'll quarrel with him if I know about the dowry matter..

1123
01:14:45,744 --> 01:14:47,126
..when we went to Amalapuram for marriage..

1124
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:48,499
..he said he vowed for me at Sathyanarayana samy..

1125
01:14:48,899 --> 01:14:51,119
..and he dropped me in Rajamundry to go to Annavaram with aunt and uncle

1126
01:14:51,591 --> 01:14:53,311
..and he asked me to come to marriage from there.

1127
01:14:54,139 --> 01:14:57,087
He planned such a way that he collects the dowry before I arrive.

1128
01:14:58,052 --> 01:15:00,327
That day I had doubt. But..

1129
01:15:00,694 --> 01:15:02,851
That is ok. How and where did you meet that girl?

1130
01:15:03,323 --> 01:15:06,166
My car got punctured at Dhaveleswaram when.. ..I was traveling from Annavaram to Amalapuram

1131
01:15:07,314 --> 01:15:08,932
I got down from the car to buy a water bottle.

1132
01:15:09,818 --> 01:15:12,427
In front of me was Sasirekha whom I am going to marry.

1133
01:15:12,962 --> 01:15:14,021
Mind froze.

1134
01:15:14,525 --> 01:15:16,525
She couldn't recognize me even after seeing me.

1135
01:15:20,337 --> 01:15:21,736
I couldn't understand anything.

1136
01:15:23,203 --> 01:15:24,427
Meanwhile I got your call.

1137
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,601
Whom she eloped.

1138
01:15:25,886 --> 01:15:29,395
Does he belong to your caste? Nice brought up.

1139
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:32,112
Hey Anand!

1140
01:15:32,432 --> 01:15:33,323
Hey, that girl..

1141
01:15:33,511 --> 01:15:35,239
Brother! You need not come here.

1142
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:36,440
Bride has eloped.

1143
01:15:36,613 --> 01:15:37,464
Has the Bride eloped?

1144
01:15:39,652 --> 01:15:41,707
Yes brother. Her character is not good.

1145
01:15:41,909 --> 01:15:43,606
They say she had few affairs already.

1146
01:15:45,064 --> 01:15:46,354
Tell me exactly, what happened?

1147
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,395
Here so many problems. I will call later.

1148
01:15:48,774 --> 01:15:50,806
I can't believe your rubbish, what you said about Sasirekha.

1149
01:15:51,118 --> 01:15:53,869
I was locked when I saw her in the marriage CD..

1150
01:15:54,259 --> 01:15:56,510
..at Nandhini sister's house in America.

1151
01:15:57,523 --> 01:15:59,278
I have seen many beautiful girls..

1152
01:15:59,703 --> 01:16:01,224
But I didn't feel like this.

1153
01:16:02,176 --> 01:16:03,627
I thought to marry this girl.

1154
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:11,939
I myself collected her details and told so many times to dad.

1155
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,710
To fix the marriage without using your lawyer tricks.

1156
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:19,818
He said that it is his luck that I accepted for the marriage

1157
01:16:20,212 --> 01:16:21,407
After that he did like this.

1158
01:16:23,654 --> 01:16:25,554
Sasi begin to worry about the marriage.

1159
01:16:26,225 --> 01:16:29,786
She was also afraid of my dad's words. So she fled.

1160
01:16:32,805 --> 01:16:34,336
My belief never went wrong anytime.

1161
01:16:35,037 --> 01:16:36,025
Sasi is a good girl.

1162
01:16:36,202 --> 01:16:37,110
Why then are you delaying?

1163
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:39,510
Why don't you tell that you are the groom?

1164
01:16:44,277 --> 01:16:45,210
Ok, let's go.

1165
01:16:45,819 --> 01:16:47,293
Anand, thank you very much.

1166
01:16:48,595 --> 01:16:49,668
Do you know Abimanyu?

1167
01:16:50,854 --> 01:16:51,639
Who is he?

1168
01:16:52,804 --> 01:16:54,743
He is the groom whom you're going to marry.

1169
01:16:56,229 --> 01:16:57,310
Why do you talk about him?

1170
01:16:58,453 --> 01:16:59,505
That means..

1171
01:17:06,292 --> 01:17:10,476
I am Abimanyu whom you're going to marry.

1172
01:17:13,224 --> 01:17:16,042
That is, I sent my details in DVD But you didn't see that.

1173
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:17,307
That is..

1174
01:17:19,074 --> 01:17:21,297
You were acting from yesterday, isn't it?

1175
01:17:22,386 --> 01:17:27,945
Did I lie and follow me to know about my character?

1176
01:17:28,189 --> 01:17:29,103
Not that Sasi.

1177
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:34,525
Or did you come to marry me for dowry?

1178
01:17:35,266 --> 01:17:36,003
Listen to me!

1179
01:17:37,728 --> 01:17:39,109
What a cheat?

1180
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:42,228
Listen what I say.

1181
01:17:43,106 --> 01:17:44,841
Oh God! Don't tell her.

1182
01:17:45,341 --> 01:17:46,110
That's it.

1183
01:17:48,685 --> 01:17:50,220
I am seeing her for two days.

1184
01:17:51,264 --> 01:17:54,002
These two days, life is like roller coaster ride in Disney land.

1185
01:17:58,052 --> 01:18:01,215
I want to marry this girl anyhow.

1186
01:18:03,038 --> 01:18:07,305
No. Already I married her mentally.

1187
01:18:08,823 --> 01:18:10,134
She has to marry me. That is the balance that remains.

1188
01:18:10,305 --> 01:18:13,309
You great lover, I haven't seen a story like this in Telugu.

1189
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:15,940
-What're you going to do? -Anand! -Don't know.

1190
01:18:20,632 --> 01:18:21,858
Take it. Rs.50,000 cash.

1191
01:18:22,845 --> 01:18:24,500
This is sister-in-law's bus ticket.

1192
01:18:24,859 --> 01:18:25,860
Are you going to send sister-in-law?

1193
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:30,467
I don't know what to do?

1194
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:32,164
She is going.

1195
01:18:34,314 --> 01:18:38,537
I'm worried that she'll mistake me if I ask her to be here.

1196
01:18:39,182 --> 01:18:44,012
I'm scared what she'll say if I ask her if I could accompany her.

1197
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:47,643
I feel like crying when I think of that!

1198
01:18:48,783 --> 01:18:50,166
I don't know what to do.

1199
01:18:52,131 --> 01:18:53,691
-Brother, please. -Abi, it's getting late.

1200
01:18:53,828 --> 01:18:55,209
One minute. I will come.

1201
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:57,143
-Who are they? -They are my friends.

1202
01:18:57,533 --> 01:19:00,098
We are going to Nagarjuna sagar by cycle.

1203
01:19:00,273 --> 01:19:01,565
-By cycle? -Yes brother.

1204
01:19:02,649 --> 01:19:03,817
We go somewhere every week.

1205
01:19:04,168 --> 01:19:07,806
This time a long trip. We have planned an adventure.

1206
01:19:08,152 --> 01:19:10,902
That's why we are going to Nagarjuna sagar by cycle

1207
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:12,740
It's a small gypsy camp.

1208
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:24,081
-Do you know itíll be very nice? -It is very nice.

1209
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:27,002
I am suffering but you are enjoying with them. At least your help..

1210
01:19:27,204 --> 01:19:29,363
Brother, I arranged for the programme.

1211
01:19:30,175 --> 01:19:31,618
If I don't go it won't be nice.

1212
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:34,697
It's getting late.

1213
01:19:35,698 --> 01:19:36,911
Sorry brother. I can't miss the trip.

1214
01:19:38,476 --> 01:19:39,293
Not that.

1215
01:19:42,072 --> 01:19:43,516
I can't come this time.

1216
01:19:43,914 --> 01:19:45,413
Definitely I'll come next time.

1217
01:19:45,765 --> 01:19:47,510
Bless me without mistaking me.

1218
01:19:58,355 --> 01:19:59,018
Why sorry?

1219
01:19:59,653 --> 01:20:00,503
I have to say sorry.

1220
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:02,475
I hit you unnecessarily.

1221
01:20:03,475 --> 01:20:04,775
It was my mistake too.

1222
01:20:17,502 --> 01:20:20,912
Look! Our goddess won't accept if you don't see the temple while visiting Vijayawada.

1223
01:20:21,409 --> 01:20:24,095
Then how? I have to go to Hyderabad.

1224
01:20:24,456 --> 01:20:25,577
You have more time to get the bus.

1225
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:26,751
Just now I verified the details.

1226
01:20:27,054 --> 01:20:27,966
I reserved the ticket.

1227
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:29,210
Then shall we go to temple?

1228
01:20:29,664 --> 01:20:30,462
In this dress?

1229
01:20:31,492 --> 01:20:32,408
Come, we will buy some dress.

1230
01:20:33,139 --> 01:20:36,069
Already you spent for me a lot. No.

1231
01:20:37,448 --> 01:20:38,930
Keep this too in that account.

1232
01:20:39,105 --> 01:20:40,485
You send me all the money later.

1233
01:20:40,659 --> 01:20:41,256
Ok?

1234
01:20:43,341 --> 01:20:44,079
Come.

1235
01:21:46,149 --> 01:21:50,958
Even if I see you for a long time..

1236
01:21:51,404 --> 01:21:56,340
..my eyes are not satiated.

1237
01:21:56,878 --> 01:22:01,721
Some change happened in my heart.

1238
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:07,243
Why does it reveal without staying quiet?

1239
01:22:07,877 --> 01:22:10,024
Are you a lighting to shine my eyes?

1240
01:22:10,377 --> 01:22:12,389
Are you an imagination in my dreams?

1241
01:22:13,091 --> 01:22:15,162
Are you a damsel in my dreams?

1242
01:22:18,372 --> 01:22:20,349
Are you a magic which mesmerises me?

1243
01:22:20,948 --> 01:22:23,032
Are you a joy to fill happiness in my heart?

1244
01:22:23,703 --> 01:22:25,846
Are you the night which made me lose my sleep?

1245
01:23:33,158 --> 01:23:38,000
Your appearance welcomes me like a wedding card

1246
01:23:38,439 --> 01:23:43,170
Your beauty pulls me with magnetic power

1247
01:23:44,181 --> 01:23:48,862
Will it join me when I hug like a creeping plant?

1248
01:23:49,543 --> 01:23:54,724
Or will it jump like a deer without getting caught?

1249
01:23:55,154 --> 01:23:56,980
It's a desire hidden in heart..

1250
01:23:57,488 --> 01:23:59,649
..without revealing from the lips.

1251
01:24:00,262 --> 01:24:02,372
Don't hold it for so long.

1252
01:24:05,519 --> 01:24:07,653
Like an order without giving consent

1253
01:24:08,185 --> 01:24:10,373
Like lust it doesnít allow to stand up.

1254
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:13,079
Don't create a confusion like that.

1255
01:25:14,948 --> 01:25:19,917
Let this male flower join the damselís plait.

1256
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:25,244
Let it take another birth in the damselís neck..

1257
01:25:26,059 --> 01:25:30,576
Let it burn as a lamp in her dot.

1258
01:25:31,346 --> 01:25:36,099
Then, let it sleep in beauty's lap.

1259
01:25:36,782 --> 01:25:38,820
Let my thoughts smear turmeric on her

1260
01:25:39,342 --> 01:25:41,385
Let my desires decorate her foot

1261
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:44,072
..and make her walk in a flower path.

1262
01:25:47,315 --> 01:25:49,365
Let me feel love value as new..

1263
01:25:49,961 --> 01:25:52,115
Let me marry her..

1264
01:25:52,813 --> 01:25:55,056
I can't live without her.

1265
01:26:19,636 --> 01:26:20,481
Do you want to buy that?

1266
01:26:27,381 --> 01:26:28,103
What?

1267
01:26:32,195 --> 01:26:32,942
Not now.

1268
01:26:33,311 --> 01:26:34,586
You have to open it after you reach Hyderabad.

1269
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:38,240
Shall we go?

1270
01:26:47,162 --> 01:26:47,875
Come here.

1271
01:26:49,652 --> 01:26:50,712
Adorn on your neck.

1272
01:27:00,804 --> 01:27:03,881
You have to bless my mom, dad, grandma, grandpa..

1273
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:09,671
..uncle, friends and who all I know.

1274
01:27:12,219 --> 01:27:14,132
Anand is a very nice person.

1275
01:27:14,492 --> 01:27:16,462
You can do whatever he thinks.

1276
01:27:24,595 --> 01:27:25,164
What Samy?

1277
01:27:25,429 --> 01:27:26,771
This garland should be over women.

1278
01:27:27,018 --> 01:27:28,119
And this garland should be over men.

1279
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,757
Tell me the exogamy.

1280
01:27:45,538 --> 01:27:46,907
Sasirekha and Paidipala gothram.

1281
01:27:47,368 --> 01:27:49,627
Abi.. no Anand and Pilluttula gothram.

1282
01:27:50,341 --> 01:27:51,165
It's wrong dear.

1283
01:28:04,899 --> 01:28:06,039
Stop your laughing.

1284
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:09,008
Pilluttula gothram.

1285
01:28:12,796 --> 01:28:14,829
-It is better than Pandhipalu. -It's Paidipala.

1286
01:28:24,725 --> 01:28:28,145
My mind feels happy after I saw the Goddess.

1287
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:30,656
Thank you very much for bringing me here.

1288
01:28:32,114 --> 01:28:33,534
Apart from other things.

1289
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:37,882
Your Vijayawada is very great because of Durga goddess.

1290
01:28:38,064 --> 01:28:39,212
Yes I know that.

1291
01:28:42,381 --> 01:28:43,397
Don't know about that miracle?

1292
01:28:44,346 --> 01:28:46,715
He is also here where the Durga goddess is.

1293
01:28:47,443 --> 01:28:49,515
Who is he? -My uncle.

1294
01:28:50,345 --> 01:28:51,052
Uncle?

1295
01:28:52,136 --> 01:28:54,469
He should be my father-in-law.

1296
01:28:55,087 --> 01:28:58,078
Shri Challasani Gopala, no Papala krishna

1297
01:28:58,266 --> 01:28:59,456
Muthanishtapa gothram.

1298
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:00,594
Muthanishtapa gothram?

1299
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:07,813
Don't you get angry on him?

1300
01:29:08,481 --> 01:29:09,408
Great angry!

1301
01:29:10,738 --> 01:29:12,987
He tortured my dad for money..

1302
01:29:17,487 --> 01:29:18,932
Do you want to talk to him?

1303
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:20,411
Do you know?

1304
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:23,132
Not only me. Whole Vijayawada knows about him.

1305
01:29:23,559 --> 01:29:26,057
-He is a great torture. -No.

1306
01:29:28,171 --> 01:29:29,467
You shouldn't keep anything in your mind.

1307
01:29:29,818 --> 01:29:31,057
You have to clear at the time.

1308
01:29:31,314 --> 01:29:32,375
Then only we will be happy.

1309
01:29:33,979 --> 01:29:35,457
Talk to him by not mentioning your name!

1310
01:29:39,181 --> 01:29:41,926
Why are you saying hello? You fool!

1311
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:44,378
Do you need style?

1312
01:29:47,787 --> 01:29:48,761
What are you doing?

1313
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:50,833
Whom do you try to cheat?

1314
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:52,662
Do you know which number you've called?

1315
01:29:52,882 --> 01:29:53,755
Who are you?

1316
01:29:54,189 --> 01:29:57,296
Vijayawada Kanaga Durga.

1317
01:29:57,918 --> 01:30:00,559
I'll step you with my leg and cut your neck..

1318
01:30:00,739 --> 01:30:05,074
..I'll tear your skin and dip into Thugabadra. You stinky fellow!

1319
01:30:05,826 --> 01:30:07,501
Have you arranged anyone at early morning to scold me?

1320
01:30:07,789 --> 01:30:08,929
Do you need dowry?

1321
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,992
Where is your son? Call him.

1322
01:30:12,398 --> 01:30:14,895
Doesn't that crazy person has shame?

1323
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:18,520
C means sections but not Challasani

1324
01:30:18,908 --> 01:30:19,574
Tell me. Where are you?

1325
01:30:20,073 --> 01:30:21,481
I will come and thrash you.

1326
01:30:21,654 --> 01:30:23,875
-I am in Durga temple. -Where?

1327
01:30:24,104 --> 01:30:25,830
If you have guts come here.

1328
01:30:26,773 --> 01:30:30,944
If I give a slap on your eardrum, you'll die by bleeding.

1329
01:30:31,524 --> 01:30:32,905
You dirty fellow!

1330
01:30:33,725 --> 01:30:35,728
You idiot fellow!

1331
01:30:36,587 --> 01:30:37,697
You rascal!

1332
01:30:38,228 --> 01:30:39,680
You rascal!

1333
01:30:57,225 --> 01:30:58,574
Don't you first attend the call and give me?

1334
01:30:58,760 --> 01:30:59,882
You only picked up the phone.

1335
01:31:00,081 --> 01:31:01,202
Do you mean to say, it was my mistake?

1336
01:31:01,385 --> 01:31:02,561
-No sir. -Have your food first!

1337
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:03,689
Why should I have?

1338
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:05,577
Some girl gave me fully.

1339
01:31:06,177 --> 01:31:08,034
You fool. Find who she is?

1340
01:31:08,181 --> 01:31:10,621
Didn't we cheat so many families..?

1341
01:31:11,911 --> 01:31:16,636
KUKATPALLI HYDERABAD.

1342
01:31:19,731 --> 01:31:21,400
I heard that you ran out from your marriage. Where are you?

1343
01:31:22,145 --> 01:31:23,097
I will tell that later.

1344
01:31:24,198 --> 01:31:25,460
Now I am in Vijayawada.

1345
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,837
Vijayawada? Everything is ok?

1346
01:31:27,172 --> 01:31:28,650
I am coming in Hyderabad bus.

1347
01:31:29,899 --> 01:31:33,327
You pick me up after 6 hours at Kukatpalli bus stop.

1348
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:35,041
Kukatpalli? Are you coming to here?

1349
01:31:35,172 --> 01:31:35,912
Listen what I say.

1350
01:31:37,086 --> 01:31:38,154
I don't know Hyderabad.

1351
01:31:38,579 --> 01:31:39,472
I am coming alone.

1352
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:41,288
Don't forget.

1353
01:31:51,341 --> 01:31:53,439
A hi-tech bus with AC leaves to Hyderabad everyday.

1354
01:31:53,949 --> 01:31:55,208
Here's your ticket.

1355
01:31:56,592 --> 01:31:58,777
Water. Drink if you feel thirsty.

1356
01:31:59,345 --> 01:32:01,478
Magazines. Read it if you feel bored.

1357
01:32:01,948 --> 01:32:03,684
Fruits. Eat if you feel hungry.

1358
01:32:05,195 --> 01:32:07,663
Bus goes straight to Hyderabad, isn't it?

1359
01:32:08,153 --> 01:32:10,088
No, it goes straight to Chennai.

1360
01:32:11,877 --> 01:32:13,376
It goes straight to Hyderabad only.

1361
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:18,375
I asked if it stops in middle..

1362
01:32:22,077 --> 01:32:23,087
Isn't it crowded?

1363
01:32:24,052 --> 01:32:25,221
Many people are there.

1364
01:32:26,005 --> 01:32:27,185
You have no problem.

1365
01:32:31,248 --> 01:32:34,778
I feel scared to go alone.

1366
01:32:37,462 --> 01:32:39,603
Ok, will you go back to your home?

1367
01:32:44,841 --> 01:32:45,853
What?

1368
01:32:48,738 --> 01:32:49,759
Nothing.

1369
01:32:50,496 --> 01:32:51,905
You call me after you reach Hyderabad.

1370
01:32:53,655 --> 01:32:54,497
My phone number is here.

1371
01:32:55,248 --> 01:32:55,987
Careful.

1372
01:32:58,582 --> 01:33:01,367
Sasi, don't worry.

1373
01:33:02,215 --> 01:33:03,203
Don't get scared.

1374
01:33:03,988 --> 01:33:05,039
Take care of your jewels.

1375
01:33:06,037 --> 01:33:07,525
You came from home with courage.

1376
01:33:08,341 --> 01:33:10,940
You will be with that courage. Ok?

1377
01:33:23,563 --> 01:33:25,462
We won't meet again, isn't it?

1378
01:33:39,167 --> 01:33:41,104
Shall I call you at once?

1379
01:33:44,462 --> 01:33:46,006
Will you call me?

1380
01:33:51,051 --> 01:33:52,255
I don't know.

1381
01:33:56,936 --> 01:33:58,782
I'll go and know the bus timings.

1382
01:34:13,462 --> 01:34:16,317
I keep quiet because that goddess is here..

1383
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:18,311
..otherwise I'll destroy this town..

1384
01:34:18,496 --> 01:34:21,569
..because that rascal is staying here.

1385
01:34:22,347 --> 01:34:23,652
Ok, where is the old man?

1386
01:34:24,051 --> 01:34:25,889
He has gone to get things for pooja..

1387
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:30,349
-Uncle! -Uncle, Bujjamma is there.

1388
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:31,059
Where?

1389
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:34,621
-Uncle! -What happened?

1390
01:34:35,042 --> 01:34:37,000
All have come.

1391
01:34:37,212 --> 01:34:37,976
She is our Bujjama.

1392
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:46,121
Stop.

1393
01:34:47,207 --> 01:34:48,550
Uncle, where would she go?

1394
01:35:05,364 --> 01:35:08,319
Gandhiji and peace were born in this nation.

1395
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,427
This nation got freedom by peace.

1396
01:35:13,046 --> 01:35:15,062
Similarly we want world to be peaceful..

1397
01:35:16,225 --> 01:35:18,178
Violence is rules everywhere.

1398
01:35:18,563 --> 01:35:21,586
Dear, Aren't you Abimanyu?

1399
01:35:22,359 --> 01:35:22,969
Are you fine?

1400
01:35:23,362 --> 01:35:24,944
I am Sasirekha's grandpa.

1401
01:35:25,654 --> 01:35:26,331
What Grandpa?

1402
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:27,576
Hey, he is our son-in-law.

1403
01:35:33,587 --> 01:35:34,783
You are looking smart.

1404
01:35:35,622 --> 01:35:36,823
I saw you in the photo.

1405
01:35:38,597 --> 01:35:39,652
You are smart in person.

1406
01:35:40,069 --> 01:35:40,666
Hey, where is he?

1407
01:35:41,164 --> 01:35:41,976
Call your uncle.

1408
01:35:42,577 --> 01:35:43,211
Where is Bujjamma?

1409
01:35:43,609 --> 01:35:44,280
He is our son-in-law.

1410
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:49,069
I'll see your dad's end.

1411
01:35:51,502 --> 01:35:52,670
Do you think I'll leave him?

1412
01:35:53,192 --> 01:35:54,167
I am not a fool..

1413
01:35:56,104 --> 01:36:00,071
Look! Do you think we are crazy people?

1414
01:36:00,398 --> 01:36:02,057
Why do you talk to me? Come, let's go.

1415
01:36:03,134 --> 01:36:04,903
-Don't mind his words! -You idiot!

1416
01:36:31,761 --> 01:36:34,331
We should have thrown her on the road when she was born

1417
01:36:34,511 --> 01:36:36,812
See, how she made to stand on the road that I brought up with indulgence.

1418
01:36:37,274 --> 01:36:37,941
-Keep quiet. -Uncle!

1419
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:39,531
-What? -Bujjama starts to Hyderabad.

1420
01:36:40,101 --> 01:36:41,213
Ticket has been booked. I saw just now.

1421
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:42,184
Is she going to Hyderabad?

1422
01:36:42,466 --> 01:36:43,916
Make a call to him?

1423
01:36:51,606 --> 01:36:53,201
That vehicle..

1424
01:36:54,095 --> 01:36:54,761
Go fast.

1425
01:36:55,377 --> 01:36:56,058
There..

1426
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:59,170
Stop sir.

1427
01:37:04,613 --> 01:37:06,346
Sasi, come out.

1428
01:37:08,465 --> 01:37:09,431
Are you crazy?

1429
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:11,529
Stop, I am talking to him.

1430
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:13,430
What she is doing with dog inside?

1431
01:37:13,757 --> 01:37:15,349
Is she crazy? Go away.

1432
01:37:15,738 --> 01:37:16,621
Calm down.

1433
01:37:22,751 --> 01:37:25,746
-Everything is ok, isn't it? -Thank you very much.

1434
01:37:34,724 --> 01:37:35,670
Who is he?

1435
01:37:35,847 --> 01:37:36,664
Why should you bother about who he is?

1436
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:37,882
Are you crazy? Don't you have sense?

1437
01:37:38,027 --> 01:37:38,698
Won't you think anything?

1438
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:40,161
Will you get into whichever vehicle you see?

1439
01:37:40,346 --> 01:37:41,252
Won't you think?

1440
01:37:41,457 --> 01:37:42,273
I will slap..

1441
01:37:48,568 --> 01:37:49,761
A big dog was there inside the vehicle!

1442
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:51,349
Do you know how I was scared?

1443
01:37:52,443 --> 01:37:53,382
Van was moving..

1444
01:37:53,908 --> 01:37:57,257
After the door was closed that big dog..

1445
01:37:58,376 --> 01:37:59,639
..I couldn't shout.

1446
01:38:01,011 --> 01:38:04,916
But you are scolding me non-stop. Big dog.

1447
01:38:06,233 --> 01:38:07,458
Don't cry.

1448
01:38:08,193 --> 01:38:10,025
Drink water. Sit down.

1449
01:38:11,818 --> 01:38:12,944
I scolded you thinking where would you be?

1450
01:38:13,617 --> 01:38:14,528
Do you know how lucky you are?

1451
01:38:14,975 --> 01:38:16,469
Else you would've gone to Nellore in that van.

1452
01:38:17,836 --> 01:38:18,887
What is this Bujjamma?

1453
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:20,810
Would you do whatever you think?

1454
01:38:21,448 --> 01:38:22,573
Won't you think at least for a second?

1455
01:38:24,859 --> 01:38:27,532
See, when you think something..

1456
01:38:27,981 --> 01:38:32,952
..count 1 to 10 in your mind. Then start your work.

1457
01:38:34,511 --> 01:38:36,057
If you do like this you will know the difference.

1458
01:38:36,673 --> 01:38:37,431
Ok?

1459
01:38:40,185 --> 01:38:41,270
Drink water.

1460
01:38:45,162 --> 01:38:47,053
Finally that short guy dragged me to the court.

1461
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:48,251
You keep quiet.

1462
01:38:48,858 --> 01:38:50,619
I don't know with which section you'll argue him.

1463
01:38:51,014 --> 01:38:52,873
He should roam in the road like a mad. That's it.

1464
01:38:53,854 --> 01:38:56,613
-Brother, this is a court. Talk slowly. -I know. You stop your nonsense.

1465
01:38:56,970 --> 01:38:58,048
Lawyer, you don't get worried.

1466
01:38:58,430 --> 01:39:00,645
-Do whatever to make this a non-bail able warrant.. -What do you murmur?

1467
01:39:01,354 --> 01:39:02,095
You don't get worried.

1468
01:39:02,525 --> 01:39:04,752
-We will win this case. That's it. -Otherwise I'll kill you.

1469
01:39:05,185 --> 01:39:07,118
Uncle, he said don't shout here. -This man too..

1470
01:39:09,237 --> 01:39:10,341
Uncle, that man..

1471
01:39:23,172 --> 01:39:24,059
Sit down.

1472
01:39:26,530 --> 01:39:27,027
Sir!

1473
01:39:27,871 --> 01:39:30,333
Skin only will fall down for slipper hit..

1474
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:34,382
If he quarrels with section I'll make him play without dress.

1475
01:39:34,662 --> 01:39:37,617
Just now the play has started. Later he'll come to know.

1476
01:39:38,301 --> 01:39:40,162
You made me to sit in decorative design.

1477
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:43,025
I will make you to suffer in fever.

1478
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:46,286
Clay guys!

1479
01:39:46,493 --> 01:39:48,567
Clay guys? Come I'll show you how clay is..

1480
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:51,223
-Stop. -You shouldn't talk in court like this.

1481
01:39:51,478 --> 01:39:52,364
What court?

1482
01:39:55,832 --> 01:39:58,195
Judge sir! He thinks our village people are crazy..

1483
01:39:58,377 --> 01:40:00,889
..he cheated and filed cases against me. You keep quiet.

1484
01:40:02,225 --> 01:40:04,302
If you talk like this you will be punished.

1485
01:40:04,623 --> 01:40:05,260
You are too speaking with favour on one side.

1486
01:40:05,725 --> 01:40:06,751
-You start. -Keep quiet.

1487
01:40:13,166 --> 01:40:14,293
What is he speaking?

1488
01:40:15,494 --> 01:40:16,137
Pardon me.

1489
01:40:16,453 --> 01:40:18,390
He doesn't know any language expect Telugu.

1490
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:20,387
If you give permission I will speak in Telugu.

1491
01:40:23,204 --> 01:40:29,319
He mesmerized me with his words that he will conduct her daughter..

1492
01:40:29,868 --> 01:40:33,595
..Sasirekha's marriage with my son Abimanyu.

1493
01:40:33,963 --> 01:40:35,409
After exchanging the betel plate..

1494
01:40:35,833 --> 01:40:38,902
I spent more money and printed the invitation..

1495
01:40:39,256 --> 01:40:43,000
..invited all my relations I had spent expenses for car and bus.

1496
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:47,761
..we started with our relations from Vijayawada to Amalapuram..

1497
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:49,429
..but the bride fled away.

1498
01:40:49,595 --> 01:40:50,642
Who fled away? Oh God!

1499
01:40:51,487 --> 01:40:55,082
When I asked him, if this was fair..

1500
01:40:55,469 --> 01:40:59,990
..he abused me with bad words that couldn't be revealed out.

1501
01:41:00,237 --> 01:41:03,525
..and made me to sit in middle of a road and around me stood the thugs..

1502
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:07,029
..and his hands held knifes and axes and made me to get scared..

1503
01:41:07,469 --> 01:41:09,536
..he said that his daughter has fled because she didn't like my face.

1504
01:41:09,787 --> 01:41:12,159
..and threatened me to give Rs.25 lakhs..

1505
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:15,204
..which is expensed till now.. because to save my life..

1506
01:41:15,625 --> 01:41:20,127
..I gave that money then returned to my town.

1507
01:41:20,829 --> 01:41:21,990
-I'll kill you. -Wait.

1508
01:41:23,899 --> 01:41:27,958
Under the cheating case section 420.. ..he cheated by telling that he'll give his daughter in marriage to my son..

1509
01:41:28,476 --> 01:41:32,439
..and he spoiled my family's dignity under the section 499 and 500.

1510
01:41:32,828 --> 01:41:36,889
..he threatened to kill me under the section 12..

1511
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,748
..and attempted to murder under the section 307 and 304..

1512
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:43,222
..I request you to conform his punishment get back my money Rs. 25,00,000..

1513
01:41:43,533 --> 01:41:47,604
..you have to save my life from him.

1514
01:41:49,034 --> 01:41:53,086
What Varatharajalu? Seems you put some village buffalos inside.

1515
01:41:53,304 --> 01:41:54,043
Who are they?

1516
01:41:54,302 --> 01:41:57,246
Have you solved the case of goddess crown theft?

1517
01:41:57,466 --> 01:42:00,954
-That is old case. -Still people are scolding us.

1518
01:42:01,525 --> 01:42:02,507
Am I not a trust member in that?

1519
01:42:02,967 --> 01:42:04,456
Day before yesterday when I came..

1520
01:42:04,833 --> 01:42:09,569
..you made a criminal lie down and hit over his sole.

1521
01:42:10,096 --> 01:42:12,136
People made it a problem because he died.

1522
01:42:12,729 --> 01:42:14,499
-He has gone on transfer. -Yes!

1523
01:42:14,791 --> 01:42:15,756
Don't get worried.

1524
01:42:17,885 --> 01:42:19,292
You have to beat and punch him.

1525
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:21,485
Head would be broken and he will die.

1526
01:42:23,911 --> 01:42:24,899
This is your habit.

1527
01:42:25,252 --> 01:42:26,947
-Uncle! -What?

1528
01:42:27,972 --> 01:42:31,286
That is his bail. You leave him.

1529
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,952
You made me sit in decorative design. I made you count the bars.

1530
01:42:39,685 --> 01:42:42,337
This is section hit.

1531
01:42:43,011 --> 01:42:47,214
Hey, Take your uncle with care.

1532
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,594
I just leave you by showing mercy.

1533
01:42:53,735 --> 01:42:55,680
-Anand! -What Sasi?

1534
01:42:58,217 --> 01:42:59,055
It's ok. What?

1535
01:43:00,194 --> 01:43:01,747
-Shall I tell you a thing? -Again?

1536
01:43:02,029 --> 01:43:03,449
I counted 1 to 10 in my mind.

1537
01:43:06,287 --> 01:43:07,344
You are correct. Tell me.

1538
01:43:10,265 --> 01:43:12,021
Now I have to go to Hyderabad, isn't it?

1539
01:43:13,363 --> 01:43:15,796
I feel scared to go alone myself.

1540
01:43:16,605 --> 01:43:19,041
I don't know what to do.

1541
01:43:20,252 --> 01:43:22,059
I called a call taxi.

1542
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:24,977
He has to come from Vijayawada. It'll take some time to come here.

1543
01:43:25,404 --> 01:43:26,641
After he comes you have to go in that taxi.

1544
01:43:28,122 --> 01:43:29,076
Ok?

1545
01:43:33,237 --> 01:43:34,050
What?

1546
01:43:37,363 --> 01:43:41,655
Shall I accompany you to Hyderabad?

1547
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:43,948
I thought of asking that!

1548
01:43:44,859 --> 01:43:47,508
I thought you will scold If I ask again.

1549
01:43:47,757 --> 01:43:49,252
If you come with me I will be happy.

1550
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:50,515
Ok, I have no work.

1551
01:43:50,895 --> 01:43:51,817
I am always a free bird.

1552
01:43:56,594 --> 01:43:58,953
-Anand! -Yes it is.

1553
01:43:59,384 --> 01:44:01,716
Opposite to Anjaneyar temple where lord Budda temple is.

1554
01:44:02,083 --> 01:44:03,101
Correct. We are there.

1555
01:44:03,586 --> 01:44:05,099
Please come fast.

1556
01:44:05,327 --> 01:44:05,935
What happened?

1557
01:44:06,385 --> 01:44:07,773
That call taxi will be here in 30 minutes

1558
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:08,632
Hail Lord Anjaneya!

1559
01:44:11,448 --> 01:44:12,408
Are you married?

1560
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,129
Do you have any love affair?

1561
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:23,340
Then?

1562
01:44:24,662 --> 01:44:25,749
I loved one girl.

1563
01:44:27,259 --> 01:44:30,927
She ran away from the marriage when I was in the verge to marry her.

1564
01:44:39,234 --> 01:44:39,754
Then?

1565
01:44:41,594 --> 01:44:43,180
I loved a girl very much.

1566
01:44:44,766 --> 01:44:47,546
But I feel scared to tell her.

1567
01:44:48,176 --> 01:44:49,836
Why are you afraid? What don't you have?

1568
01:44:50,292 --> 01:44:51,760
You are looking smart and also you're a nice person.

1569
01:44:52,122 --> 01:44:53,465
Whoever is the girl she will fall in love with you.

1570
01:44:54,654 --> 01:44:55,375
Is it true?

1571
01:44:57,037 --> 01:44:58,063
Will you love me?

1572
01:45:01,487 --> 01:45:02,730
Really, I am afraid of girls.

1573
01:45:04,149 --> 01:45:06,239
This time tell me if you like any girl..

1574
01:45:06,948 --> 01:45:08,859
I'll talk to her and make your marriage happen.

1575
01:45:11,148 --> 01:45:12,212
Which type of marriage do you like?

1576
01:45:13,613 --> 01:45:14,528
Shall I tell?

1577
01:45:15,085 --> 01:45:16,509
But you shouldn't laugh hearing it.

1578
01:45:22,783 --> 01:45:27,155
I thought my marriage will happen grandly in Telugu style.

1579
01:45:28,109 --> 01:45:30,442
Wearing silk dhoti and seated in marriage seat..

1580
01:45:31,222 --> 01:45:35,296
..and tie the sacred thread to that girl and hold with her finger..

1581
01:45:35,645 --> 01:45:38,552
..to walk and see the Arunthathi star.

1582
01:45:39,506 --> 01:45:44,858
..I have to take that shy girl and go to America.

1583
01:45:45,641 --> 01:45:48,189
..should celebrate first night in a nice suite..

1584
01:45:48,493 --> 01:45:52,990
..at top most floor in a seven star hotel at Las Vegas.

01:45:53,737 --> 01:45:55,618
..travel all around world for Honey moon..

1586
01:45:56,998 --> 01:45:58,935
..and take care her like an angel..

1587
01:46:00,307 --> 01:46:02,530
..should beget one boy and one girl..

1588
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:08,957
..both of us bring them up and should return to India..

1589
01:46:10,121 --> 01:46:12,314
Again we'll arrange their marriage in our Telugu style..

1590
01:46:13,154 --> 01:46:18,916
..and buy hundred acre coconut grove near our Krishna river

1591
01:46:20,324 --> 01:46:22,896

1592
01:46:24,409 --> 01:46:26,181

..and swinging likeÖ

1594
01:46:32,416 --> 01:46:35,445
Your fiancÈe is very lucky.

1595
01:46:55,881 --> 01:46:56,694
Greetings!

1596
01:47:02,494 --> 01:47:03,770
This is the car which you have hired.

1597
01:47:05,025 --> 01:47:08,068
You should sit in backseat. I drive sitting in front seat.

1598
01:47:08,426 --> 01:47:10,477
Two times only I'll stop on the way before we reach Hyderabad.

1599
01:47:10,769 --> 01:47:12,387
First you should pay the money.

1600
01:47:13,234 --> 01:47:15,099
Tell me, if you've any objection to this..

1601
01:47:19,752 --> 01:47:20,921
Why should you need our name and address?

1602
01:47:21,516 --> 01:47:24,228
Because, if some accident happens and if you die before reaching Hyderabad.

1603
01:47:25,275 --> 01:47:26,018
Die?

1604
01:47:27,675 --> 01:47:29,851
How will the media know that you only have died?

1605
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:31,453
Don't they need details?

1606
01:47:32,082 --> 01:47:32,722
Name?

1607
01:47:34,844 --> 01:47:35,771
You keep quiet. I'll tell him.

1608
01:47:43,009 --> 01:47:45,335
Don't you remember that you should sit in the backseat?

1609
01:47:54,819 --> 01:47:55,569
Why have you stopped here?

1610
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,952
I'll pay the tax and come.

1611
01:47:59,462 --> 01:47:59,927
Tax?

1612
01:48:01,216 --> 01:48:01,987
What is the tax?

1613
01:48:02,585 --> 01:48:05,051
Damn! Who knows whether it is road tax or vehicle tax..?

1614
01:48:16,583 --> 01:48:17,365
Don't you have sense?

1615
01:48:17,555 --> 01:48:18,993
You said that you'll pay the tax but you came having drunk.

1616
01:48:19,635 --> 01:48:22,594
Oh God! I feel scared of drunkards driving. Let's go.

1617
01:48:24,606 --> 01:48:26,650
Don't say drunkard. say tax payer.

1618
01:48:26,841 --> 01:48:27,662
Tax payer?

1619
01:48:31,028 --> 01:48:34,704
Do you know who is paying the tax sincerely in this State daily?

1620
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:38,173
The drunkards that whom you meant.

1621
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:42,744
Do you know per annum income of our State?

1622
01:48:50,359 --> 01:48:54,134
The roads where you are roaming, fly overs, Government hospitals..

1623
01:48:54,497 --> 01:49:00,006
..Police stations, Electricity board, Colleges, and finally in 2Rs. Rice.

1624
01:49:00,601 --> 01:49:01,978
We are paying the tax by spoiling our health..

1625
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:07,457
..and we are blamed as drunkards by you.

1626
01:49:24,743 --> 01:49:25,416
What happened sir?

1627
01:49:35,697 --> 01:49:36,230
What happened?

1628
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:37,725
Vehicle has got break down.

1629
01:49:37,918 --> 01:49:38,690
Then do the repair.

1630
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,716
It's company's policy that I shouldn't do the repair.

1631
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:47,552
-What policy? I will.. -Anand, please control yourself.

1632
01:49:51,622 --> 01:49:53,105
When will he come here?

1633
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:00,680
Then what to do now?

1634
01:50:29,582 --> 01:50:30,252
One minute.

1635
01:50:30,645 --> 01:50:31,987
Seems this is Hyderabad number.

1636
01:50:33,949 --> 01:50:35,943
Sorry, I won't come for two days.

1637
01:50:36,399 --> 01:50:37,307
What are you talking?

1638
01:50:38,617 --> 01:50:40,648
-She is my friend. -Ask her to inform you if she sees Bujjama.

1639
01:50:40,792 --> 01:50:41,431
Ok uncle.

1640
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:46,413
-Do you know? Our class mate Sasi ran away from her house. -Oh God!

1641
01:50:48,143 --> 01:50:49,886
-I heard it is her marriage problem. -Damn!

1642
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:51,512
What are you saying?

1643
01:50:51,716 --> 01:50:54,094
Her relatives have come here to see if she would come here.

1644
01:50:54,523 --> 01:50:55,231
Rascals!

1645
01:50:55,621 --> 01:50:56,992
Really? I will tell.

1646
01:50:57,185 --> 01:50:58,652
-Has she told that she would inform you about our Bujamma? -Yes uncle.

1647
01:50:58,831 --> 01:51:01,096
-Ok dear. -Pathetic, they are worrying much.

1648
01:51:01,309 --> 01:51:04,362
-Yes dear. -I understood.

1649
01:51:04,865 --> 01:51:06,711
You call me after he leaves from there.

1650
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:09,501
-Wait. -He wants to talk to you.

1651
01:51:10,956 --> 01:51:11,833
What? Who?

1652
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:21,966
Seems signal is not available.

1653
01:51:22,363 --> 01:51:23,227
What phone is this?

1654
01:51:23,412 --> 01:51:24,322
I switched off the phone.

1655
01:51:38,845 --> 01:51:40,902
-Tell me. What happened? -My uncle is..

1656
01:51:41,844 --> 01:51:43,118
Bujjama has not come here.

1657
01:51:43,402 --> 01:51:45,506
-She said that she doesn't know when she'll come here. -Oh God!

1658
01:51:46,561 --> 01:51:47,440
Signal has not come.

1659
01:51:47,813 --> 01:51:49,280
I can't hear what you scold me.

1660
01:51:53,252 --> 01:51:54,844
I am getting tortured because she ran away.

1661
01:51:55,002 --> 01:51:56,006
-Now I can't go to Hyderabad. -You don't worry.

1662
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:57,239
-Where should I go now? -We will do something.

1663
01:51:57,412 --> 01:51:59,675
-What should I do? -How?

1664
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:10,169
Brother, how you are here?

1665
01:52:12,345 --> 01:52:13,512
Didn't she go to Hyderabad?

1666
01:52:14,886 --> 01:52:15,855
Here, cool drink.

1667
01:52:20,654 --> 01:52:21,466
Where is the map?

1668
01:52:22,561 --> 01:52:23,564
Hey, take out the map.

1669
01:52:29,390 --> 01:52:31,507
Sasi, we have three options.

1670
01:52:31,965 --> 01:52:34,282
No:1, Both of us should go to Hyderabad.

1671
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:36,798
We should book a room in the hotel and should wait for your friend's call.

1672
01:52:37,493 --> 01:52:40,090
Think yourself, how will it be if both of us stay in a room.

1673
01:52:40,417 --> 01:52:41,368
Myself, it's not correct.

1674
01:52:41,842 --> 01:52:45,078
No:2, you have to come with me to Vijayawada and stay in my home..

1675
01:52:45,289 --> 01:52:47,939
..I'll drop you at your friend place after she calls you.

1676
01:52:48,402 --> 01:52:51,100
No:3, Let's go with this gang to Nagarjuna sagar..

1677
01:52:51,567 --> 01:52:53,768
..and let's enjoy this weekend.

1678
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:55,318
It's too if you have no objection..

1679
01:52:55,881 --> 01:52:58,692
I'll drop you at your friend's place after she calls you.

1680
01:52:59,746 --> 01:53:01,846
You can decide yourself which is better in these options.

1681
01:53:09,521 --> 01:53:12,481
I have to introduce someone. He is my brother Abi..

1682
01:53:17,838 --> 01:53:21,125
She is my brother's friend. Am I not right brother?

1683
01:53:25,854 --> 01:53:28,238
They requested me to stay with us for 2 days.

1684
01:53:29,038 --> 01:53:30,520
-After your acceptance.. -Let's bring them.

1685
01:53:32,367 --> 01:53:35,221
Both of you friends or lovers?

1686
01:53:35,511 --> 01:53:36,605
Else already are you married.

1687
01:53:43,502 --> 01:53:45,129
Friends means like boy friend and girl friend?

1688
01:53:47,661 --> 01:53:48,961
You keep quiet.

1689
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:54,553
Oh god!

1690
01:53:57,331 --> 01:53:59,703
If you want to join in our group, don't we want know about you?

1691
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,073
Not like that.

1692
01:54:05,423 --> 01:54:07,439
-You have to tell changing each others. -Which means..

1693
01:54:07,625 --> 01:54:09,921
Which means you should tell about her and she about you.

1694
01:54:11,783 --> 01:54:13,083
Her name is Sasirekha.

1695
01:54:18,291 --> 01:54:19,945
Look her? Whoever sees her will follow her.

1696
01:54:21,289 --> 01:54:22,327
She is very good girl.

1697
01:54:22,496 --> 01:54:24,152
But at the same time she has more anger.

1698
01:54:25,942 --> 01:54:27,725
She ran out from her marriage which was conducted against her will.

1699
01:54:30,756 --> 01:54:32,855
I'll escort her till she reaches her friend's house in Hyderabad.

1700
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:41,439
His name is Anand. He said so like that.

1701
01:54:42,659 --> 01:54:44,323
I don't know what his qualification is.

1702
01:54:46,283 --> 01:54:48,048
But he often flicks bikes.

1703
01:54:49,429 --> 01:54:51,056
He helped me a lot.

1704
01:54:52,810 --> 01:54:56,164
He is a nice person but he has little craziness.

1705
01:55:17,289 --> 01:55:19,154
-Thanks. - No thanks!

1706
01:55:21,146 --> 01:55:22,418
Where do you stay in Vijayawada?

1707
01:55:22,599 --> 01:55:23,871
-Abi, shall we go? -Let's go.

1708
01:55:27,011 --> 01:55:28,748
Where do you stay in Vijayawada?

1709
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:30,586
Hey, it's wrong. Come.

1710
01:55:56,037 --> 01:55:58,153
-Look! The barrier gates have been opened after many years. -Yes, it is very nice.

1711
01:56:02,054 --> 01:56:03,112
I am seeing this for the first time.

1712
01:56:15,511 --> 01:56:17,197
Look there, is that a boat?

1713
01:56:18,657 --> 01:56:19,262
For what?

1714
01:56:20,363 --> 01:56:20,930
What is your name?

1715
01:56:23,435 --> 01:56:24,466
That goddess is very powerful.

1716
01:56:36,050 --> 01:56:38,170
Sasirekha, your name is very nice.

1717
01:56:38,796 --> 01:56:40,418
-You always look cute -It's ok.

1718
01:56:41,162 --> 01:56:42,884
-Ask me whatever you want. -I don't want anything.

1719
01:56:43,266 --> 01:56:44,300
-Shall I bring your cycle with me? -Anand!

1720
01:56:45,574 --> 01:56:46,769
-She is calling me. -Isn't it?

1721
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:49,530
What? What happened? Why are you going by leaving me alone?

1722
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:50,347
What happened?

1723
01:56:54,595 --> 01:56:55,569
Oh God!

1724
01:56:57,161 --> 01:56:58,886
Go carefully! You may fall down.

1725
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:02,220
You should be with me.

1726
01:57:13,761 --> 01:57:14,457
It's superb!

1727
01:57:16,881 --> 01:57:18,536
Seems they have lost themselves. Come.

1728
01:57:42,845 --> 01:57:43,744
Take a photo of mine.

1729
01:57:43,938 --> 01:57:46,548
-If we go near it will be nice. -Take me a photo.

1730
01:57:53,145 --> 01:57:54,028
One minute.

1731
01:58:46,475 --> 01:58:47,990
Oh God! No.

1732
01:58:48,734 --> 01:58:50,221
-I can't. I'm feeling scared. -Where are you going?

1733
01:58:51,112 --> 01:58:52,311
Are you scared?

1734
01:58:52,942 --> 01:58:54,880
Didn't you get down from that big hotel day before yesterday?

1735
01:58:55,262 --> 01:58:56,452
That day I got down in a hurry.

1736
01:58:57,123 --> 01:58:59,056
But this.. what if I fall down.. I can't.

1737
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:01,087
I too feel scared.

1738
01:59:01,581 --> 01:59:02,854
Don't we have this belts and ropes?

1739
01:59:03,132 --> 01:59:04,225
See, how they are getting down easily.

1740
01:59:04,416 --> 01:59:05,333
Nothing will happen. I am also getting down.

1741
01:59:06,652 --> 01:59:08,444
If you will be with me.. Ok, come.

1742
01:59:08,967 --> 01:59:09,929
I will be with you. Come.

1743
01:59:19,757 --> 01:59:21,240
Oh Lord Anjaneya!

1744
01:59:45,675 --> 01:59:46,378
Careful.

1745
02:00:07,658 --> 02:00:09,252
Oh God!

1746
02:01:37,641 --> 02:01:40,809
Vijayawada bachelor became popular over 10 days love.

1747
02:01:41,574 --> 02:01:44,295
Gudivada gangster is a great gambler.

1748
02:01:45,211 --> 02:01:48,030
This pretty spoiled the mood of Machilipatnam.

1749
02:01:48,833 --> 02:01:51,760
This magic girl made Ponnur guys to follow her

1750
02:01:56,425 --> 02:01:59,250
Isn't every guy a king of his land?

1751
02:01:59,715 --> 02:02:02,702
Isn't every girl a princess?

1752
02:02:03,247 --> 02:02:05,459
If all these people meet in one place..

1753
02:02:05,713 --> 02:02:09,570
..this hills would shake up, you go head.

1754
02:02:10,184 --> 02:02:13,847
Because of our disturbance the earth would shaken up

1755
02:02:14,948 --> 02:02:19,286
Because of our sound the sky would get deaf.

1756
02:02:19,869 --> 02:02:22,666
Baby! Tell it one more time.

1757
02:02:23,203 --> 02:02:26,317
Enjoy it! There is only one life.

1758
02:02:30,559 --> 02:02:33,770
Happiness is our logo.

1759
02:02:59,930 --> 02:03:04,190
This life is ours Lets make merry together

1760
02:03:07,256 --> 02:03:12,859
Every girl throbs our heart Come, lets mingle

1761
02:03:43,684 --> 02:03:47,042
Make your play great let any monkey join you.

1762
02:03:50,951 --> 02:03:55,739
Make your song rhythmic let any donkey sing with you.

1763
02:03:58,502 --> 02:04:03,464
Don't stop your beat, even if these boulders break.

1764
02:04:04,023 --> 02:04:08,809
Don't leave your wish, for anyoneís advise.

1765
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:23,016
Look! This is the place where there are no bounds.

1766
02:05:26,082 --> 02:05:31,621
Have it! This is the happiness that can't be bought.

1767
02:05:33,501 --> 02:05:38,961
Even if you save money illegally..

1768
02:05:39,253 --> 02:05:44,386
Without a smile, it has no value.

1769
02:06:12,038 --> 02:06:14,784
-Behave yourself Sasi. -Who are you?

1770
02:06:15,606 --> 02:06:16,387
What?

1771
02:06:19,060 --> 02:06:20,442
Do you feel?

1772
02:06:21,742 --> 02:06:26,143
Why do you bother if I dance with someone?

1773
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:28,690
You did dance with her.

1774
02:06:29,203 --> 02:06:31,330
But shouldn't I dance like that?

1775
02:06:31,685 --> 02:06:33,316
-Listen to me. -Because..

1776
02:06:34,801 --> 02:06:37,845
You are male.

1777
02:06:38,203 --> 02:06:40,381
I am female.

1778
02:06:42,215 --> 02:06:47,176
Actually what do you men think?

1779
02:06:49,198 --> 02:06:51,427
Our dad is also like that.

1780
02:06:52,533 --> 02:06:57,353
Idiot fellow. Whatever he wishes should happen.

1781
02:06:57,583 --> 02:06:59,447
And I have to do that.

1782
02:07:03,295 --> 02:07:07,673
I heard that American guy has seen me somewhere.

1783
02:07:08,140 --> 02:07:12,149
He liked me and he wanted to marry me.

1784
02:07:16,875 --> 02:07:20,057
Don't I want to like him?

1785
02:07:22,394 --> 02:07:27,262
Why then has my dad not understood this matter.

1786
02:07:28,365 --> 02:07:32,021
He gave importance to that guy..

1787
02:07:33,734 --> 02:07:36,732
..but he didn't give the same to his own daughter.

1788
02:07:40,409 --> 02:07:44,521
Should I get scared if he abuses?

1789
02:07:51,301 --> 02:07:53,012
Can't we speak like that?

1790
02:07:57,889 --> 02:07:59,891
What is the problem between you two?

1791
02:08:00,106 --> 02:08:02,268
Both of you are always murmuring.

1792
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:08,802
This fellow calls me as sister-in-law when he sees me.

1793
02:08:09,546 --> 02:08:12,650
And you stamp his leg.

1794
02:08:14,172 --> 02:08:15,603
What is the matter?

1795
02:08:17,363 --> 02:08:19,981
You thought that I didn't see it.

1796
02:08:21,817 --> 02:08:23,654
Idiot!

1797
02:08:24,418 --> 02:08:27,328
All men are crazy.

1798
02:08:27,957 --> 02:08:31,237
They just show their build up outwardly.

1799
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:33,541
Careful!

1800
02:08:36,612 --> 02:08:37,971
I haven't fell down..

1801
02:08:39,135 --> 02:08:40,188
Hold it.

1802
02:08:44,554 --> 02:08:45,547
Sit down.

1803
02:08:49,837 --> 02:08:52,559
Why did you dance with that girl?

1804
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:56,011
Whoever girl you see, will you follow?

1805
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:12,652
You should win girls heart.

1806
02:09:14,238 --> 02:09:16,251
Girls won't fall in love just like that.

1807
02:09:17,916 --> 02:09:22,927
But once if they fall in love, they will give everything.

1808
02:09:23,930 --> 02:09:27,925
Males like you won't give that in their whole life.

1809
02:09:30,926 --> 02:09:34,336
Don't take girls easily.

1810
02:10:28,046 --> 02:10:28,604
What happened?

1811
02:10:31,025 --> 02:10:31,925
Oh God!

1812
02:10:33,457 --> 02:10:35,606
-What happened? -Nothing. Durga got ankle twist near the waterfalls.

1813
02:10:35,775 --> 02:10:38,917
Seems it is sprained. Do anybody have Iodex or pain relief spray?

1814
02:10:39,795 --> 02:10:41,587
Sit down. Careful. Remove her shoe.

1815
02:10:42,444 --> 02:10:43,103
Give your leg..

1816
02:10:47,346 --> 02:10:48,838
-Is it paining here? -I feel it very painful.

1817
02:10:49,328 --> 02:10:52,180
It is a little pain. Nothing will happen. See, it's not..

1818
02:10:52,930 --> 02:10:54,351
Everything will be fine within 10 minutes.

1819
02:11:03,381 --> 02:11:04,670
-Do you have pain at knee? -No

1820
02:11:04,849 --> 02:11:06,181
-You don't have pain, isn't it? -No.

1821
02:11:07,529 --> 02:11:08,130
Careful!

1822
02:11:10,498 --> 02:11:12,507
-I want to talk to you. -Tell me. What is it?

1823
02:11:17,273 --> 02:11:18,431
-Take care of her. -Ok brother.

1824
02:11:19,667 --> 02:11:20,295
Why suddenly?

1825
02:11:20,470 --> 02:11:21,731
Let's go to Hyderabad at once.

1826
02:11:22,337 --> 02:11:23,822
You said that we will go to Srisailam with them.

1827
02:11:24,112 --> 02:11:24,877
Then you go with them.

1828
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:26,214
I will go to Hyderabad.

1829
02:11:27,761 --> 02:11:28,925
-Will you go alone? -Yes!

1830
02:11:30,295 --> 02:11:31,328
Give me Rs.1000.

1831
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:34,644
I will send you everything after I reach Hyderabad.

1832
02:11:37,399 --> 02:11:39,164
-Ok leave it. I'll also come with you. -No need.

1833
02:11:40,121 --> 02:11:41,220
I can go alone.

1834
02:11:42,336 --> 02:11:43,204
I don't have any afraid.

1835
02:11:47,753 --> 02:11:48,664
Hey psycho.

1836
02:11:51,657 --> 02:11:52,605
It's enough.

1837
02:11:56,175 --> 02:11:57,481
A call has come from Hyderabad.

1838
02:11:57,698 --> 02:11:58,900
Sasi should go to Hyderabad urgently.

1839
02:11:59,432 --> 02:12:00,601
So, don't I want go along with her?

1840
02:12:08,046 --> 02:12:09,359
-Thank you very much. -Thank you brother.

1841
02:12:25,275 --> 02:12:28,173
You are going because I am closely moving with Anand.

1842
02:12:29,904 --> 02:12:30,652
Why should I bother?

1843
02:12:31,524 --> 02:12:32,657
He is nothing to me.

1844
02:12:33,859 --> 02:12:34,724
Don't lie.

1845
02:12:35,984 --> 02:12:37,022
I have no necessity.

1846
02:12:45,805 --> 02:12:47,108
It's all none of my business.

1847
02:13:42,287 --> 02:13:43,414
I can't understand anything.

1848
02:13:44,122 --> 02:13:45,242
Suddenly what happened to you?

1849
02:13:45,694 --> 02:13:47,590
Why do you want to go Hyderabad now?

1850
02:13:48,213 --> 02:13:50,054
We thought that we should be with them till you receive your friend's call.

1851
02:13:50,844 --> 02:13:51,686
Why are you laughing?

1852
02:13:57,067 --> 02:13:59,034
If you get angry or scary..

1853
02:13:59,698 --> 02:14:03,070
..someone told me to count 1 to 10.

1854
02:14:03,250 --> 02:14:04,748
Are you telling me, what I said to you?

1855
02:14:11,350 --> 02:14:12,349
What do you think of me?

1856
02:14:16,865 --> 02:14:19,474
I should hit myself because I accompanied you so far.

1857
02:14:21,684 --> 02:14:24,507
I said, I'll drop you in Hyderabad. After I'll drop you..

1858
02:14:26,985 --> 02:14:28,006
I will go my way.

1859
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:58,651
Donít know why my soul doesnít accept

1860
02:14:59,144 --> 02:15:05,801
And my silence doesnít reveal what it is.

1861
02:15:07,268 --> 02:15:10,649
The time my happiness comes out..

1862
02:15:11,029 --> 02:15:14,006
..my anger hides it.

1863
02:15:14,614 --> 02:15:21,338
I am behind him and he is behind me.

1864
02:15:21,871 --> 02:15:29,278
This joy doesnít ask, how long is this journey?

1865
02:15:30,332 --> 02:15:36,565
Donít know why my soul doesnít accept

1866
02:15:37,079 --> 02:15:44,438
And my silence doesnít reveal what it is.

1867
02:16:14,248 --> 02:16:17,786
Has it pricked the cheek like a thorn..

1868
02:16:18,206 --> 02:16:21,167
..or has it moved the shyness slowly?

1869
02:16:21,689 --> 02:16:24,724
Has it drenched the mind like rain..

1870
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:28,423
..or has it touched the body like Veena?

1871
02:16:44,561 --> 02:16:51,306
Youth doesnít know about mischiefs.

1872
02:16:59,846 --> 02:17:03,224
Has it forgotten or is it a break in play?

1873
02:17:03,557 --> 02:17:08,157
Just stand up and see.

1874
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:16,273
My soul doesnít accept at the minute when I thought..

1875
02:17:16,915 --> 02:17:24,507
If I resist, my mind turns against me.

1876
02:17:26,957 --> 02:17:29,217
-Prices of general stuff. -Should be reduced.

1877
02:17:29,672 --> 02:17:32,176
-Prices of general stuff. -Should be reduced.

1878
02:17:32,743 --> 02:17:34,191
Onion is better than a mother.

1879
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:37,954
-Onion is better than a mother. -But prices are too heavy.

1880
02:17:38,138 --> 02:17:40,424
-Prices of general stuff. -Should be reduced.

1881
02:17:40,823 --> 02:17:43,120
-Prices of general stuff. -Should be reduced.

1882
02:17:43,505 --> 02:17:45,938
-Prices of general stuff. -Should be reduced.

1883
02:17:53,873 --> 02:17:55,518
Onion is better than a mother.

1884
02:17:59,163 --> 02:18:01,416
-Prices of general stuff. -Should be reduced.

1885
02:18:01,886 --> 02:18:04,058
-Prices of general stuff. -Should be reduced.

1886
02:19:20,019 --> 02:19:22,416
-Nothing. -Oh God! Blood!

1887
02:20:11,994 --> 02:20:14,570
Oh God! Blood!

1888
02:20:15,229 --> 02:20:19,153
-Nothing will happen. -It is bleeding. It's paining me.

1889
02:20:22,147 --> 02:20:23,349
Sasi, nothing has happened.

1890
02:20:28,424 --> 02:20:30,013
I am going to die, isn't it?

1891
02:20:33,227 --> 02:20:34,145
Nothing has happened.

1892
02:20:34,601 --> 02:20:37,534
-Nothing has happened. I told you. -No. I know.

1893
02:20:38,588 --> 02:20:41,629
The person who gets hit on head will die.

1894
02:20:41,814 --> 02:20:42,670
Sasi, nothing will happen.

1895
02:20:43,370 --> 02:20:45,753
My friend died like that.

1896
02:20:47,509 --> 02:20:48,691
Hey, go to some hospital.

1897
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:54,772
If I had been alive I wouldn't have told you..

1898
02:20:55,942 --> 02:21:00,599
-Now I am going to die, isn't it? -Why are you talking like this?

1899
02:21:00,961 --> 02:21:02,527
I'll tell you.

1900
02:21:04,228 --> 02:21:10,025
I like you very much.

1901
02:21:11,993 --> 02:21:18,234
You crazy! Didn't you jump in Godhavari for me?

1902
02:21:19,281 --> 02:21:22,864
That time itself I had fallen in love with you.

1903
02:21:25,986 --> 02:21:29,540
No one has done like that for me, isn't it?

1904
02:21:32,359 --> 02:21:33,944
Nothing happened. Drive fast.

1905
02:21:35,282 --> 02:21:39,486
Do you know how I cried in Vijayawada bus stand?

1906
02:21:40,594 --> 02:21:43,900
I thought that I won't see you again.

1907
02:21:48,811 --> 02:21:49,970
Go fast.

1908
02:21:53,049 --> 02:21:59,681
I feel to marry you.

1909
02:22:03,584 --> 02:22:06,935
But I don't want first night in Las Vegas.

1910
02:22:08,718 --> 02:22:12,466
Only on my grandma's roof cot.

1911
02:22:14,111 --> 02:22:16,741
You know, it is very lucky?

1912
02:22:17,106 --> 02:22:17,853
It's ok to me whatever you say.

1913
02:22:19,138 --> 02:22:20,238
Go fast man.

1914
02:22:21,674 --> 02:22:25,092
If you want, we'll celebrate our second night in Las Vegas.

1915
02:22:27,817 --> 02:22:28,993
Oh God!

1916
02:22:29,139 --> 02:22:30,129
Sasi, nothing will happen.

1917
02:22:30,281 --> 02:22:32,791
-I am dying with pain. -No Sasi. Damn it.

1918
02:22:32,956 --> 02:22:35,709
-I'll die. -No.

1919
02:22:36,529 --> 02:22:41,680
You crazy! I love you.

1920
02:22:49,393 --> 02:22:50,601
Go fast.

1921
02:22:51,905 --> 02:22:52,809
Sasi, nothing will happen to you.

1922
02:22:53,150 --> 02:22:54,645
We have reached the hospital.

1923
02:22:56,699 --> 02:22:57,370
Nothing Sasi.

1924
02:23:05,268 --> 02:23:05,840
Don't worry.

1925
02:23:06,231 --> 02:23:07,804
Tell me the patient's name.

1926
02:23:09,483 --> 02:23:09,835
How are you related to her?

1927
02:23:39,757 --> 02:23:42,031
-Nothing to worry? -Yes, it's alright. -Everything is alright. You don't worry.

1928
02:23:49,606 --> 02:23:50,523
Stop.

1929
02:24:03,525 --> 02:24:05,890
-Come here. -Dear! You aren't hurt, are you?

1930
02:24:06,914 --> 02:24:07,980
Have you called her parents?

1931
02:24:08,338 --> 02:24:10,852
Just now I called. Already they have entered the city.

1932
02:24:11,163 --> 02:24:12,171
They will be here in 10 minutes.

1933
02:24:12,731 --> 02:24:15,432
Ok. Where did you meet this girl?

1934
02:24:16,334 --> 02:24:18,106
Please be with her for sometime.

1935
02:24:20,432 --> 02:24:21,082
Mom!

1936
02:24:21,870 --> 02:24:23,024
You didn't get hurt, isn't it?

1937
02:24:23,629 --> 02:24:26,289
-No, nothing happened to me. -Are you fine?

1938
02:24:26,587 --> 02:24:27,661
Actually what had happened?

1939
02:24:28,655 --> 02:24:29,260
Abi dear!

1940
02:24:30,744 --> 02:24:31,420
Why are you silent?

1941
02:24:32,716 --> 02:24:34,127
Why don't you talk while I am asking you?

1942
02:24:40,177 --> 02:24:40,781
Sir!

1943
02:24:42,552 --> 02:24:43,118
Move.

1944
02:24:44,188 --> 02:24:44,786
No uncle.

1945
02:24:45,461 --> 02:24:46,529
Just now they gave anesthesia.

1946
02:24:46,871 --> 02:24:48,146
She should take rest for sometime.

1947
02:24:48,333 --> 02:24:49,819
Doctors said not to let anyone inside.

1948
02:24:51,020 --> 02:24:52,898
-Who admitted her in the hospital? -That man..

1949
02:24:55,628 --> 02:24:59,351
Your dad made me go to jail and you made her to get hospitalized.

1950
02:25:01,266 --> 02:25:03,909
-How dare you hit my son? -No, I'll kill him.

1951
02:25:04,386 --> 02:25:06,389
-Stop it. -There is nothing wrong in his hitting?

1952
02:25:07,915 --> 02:25:11,512
He thought to conduct his daughter's marriage grandly to a groom from America.

1953
02:25:12,029 --> 02:25:13,675
But she ran out hearing her marriage proposal.

1954
02:25:14,567 --> 02:25:16,381
They got scared of her safety and searched for her.

1955
02:25:17,106 --> 02:25:21,120
Whoever it is, would get angry by knowing that she is hospitalized.. ..in Hyderabad hospital with head injury.

1956
02:25:21,549 --> 02:25:23,168
Won't you get angry if I get hit?

1957
02:25:25,415 --> 02:25:26,933
Why do you quarrel with him?

1958
02:25:28,845 --> 02:25:30,367
Do you want dowry, dad?

1959
02:25:31,009 --> 02:25:32,630
You earned very well in Vijayawada.

1960
02:25:33,022 --> 02:25:35,202
And I am also earning very well in America.

1961
02:25:36,181 --> 02:25:38,497
You tortured me for past 2 years by insisting me to marry someone.

1962
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:40,560
You said ok whoever the girl is.

1963
02:25:42,014 --> 02:25:45,362
I liked Sasi. I want Sasi.

1964
02:25:46,441 --> 02:25:48,651
That's why I collected her details and gave you.

1965
02:25:49,606 --> 02:25:53,684
Earlier I told you not to play your tricks and do this marriage.

1966
02:25:55,900 --> 02:25:57,040
Even so you showed your true nature.

1967
02:25:57,449 --> 02:25:58,828
No dear. What about our range?

1968
02:25:59,164 --> 02:26:02,871
That means.. Did you sell your son for your range?

1969
02:26:05,688 --> 02:26:08,567
You made me like a male prostitute.

1970
02:26:10,575 --> 02:26:11,851
I feel very ashamed.

1971
02:26:12,034 --> 02:26:13,896
You asked him correctly.

1972
02:26:14,409 --> 02:26:15,936
Why do you speak about my dad?

1973
02:26:16,814 --> 02:26:17,703
What did you do?

1974
02:26:18,621 --> 02:26:21,802
When I called you from America, I told you all the details that

1975
02:26:22,782 --> 02:26:24,011
..I am very busy.

1976
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:27,261
..That's why I sent a DVD with my details.

1977
02:26:27,790 --> 02:26:29,413
..First you see and make her to see..

1978
02:26:29,791 --> 02:26:32,255
..And I asked you to fix the marriage only if both of you like me.

1979
02:26:32,688 --> 02:26:33,798
Didn't I say it or not?

1980
02:26:34,488 --> 02:26:36,576
You said no need of all this. Your daughter is a gold.

1981
02:26:37,795 --> 02:26:40,518
But you couldn't know what was in her mind.

1982
02:26:41,602 --> 02:26:45,120
You've time to arrange the marriage grandly and to show your pride to others.

1983
02:26:46,138 --> 02:26:47,472
Your own daughterÖ.

1984
02:26:49,129 --> 02:26:54,626
But you have no time to tell her marriage to her and what she likes.

1985
02:26:55,547 --> 02:26:58,088
Whoever the girl is, will get scared hearing about their marriage suddenly.

1986
02:26:59,775 --> 02:27:02,297
Why don't you understand this small matter?

1987
02:27:04,367 --> 02:27:10,619
Don't you know difference between your daughter and buffalo?

1988
02:27:11,070 --> 02:27:12,351
What kind of man are you?

1989
02:27:13,825 --> 02:27:15,130
Now she got hurt.

1990
02:27:15,711 --> 02:27:18,432
But even so you are ready to fight for your prestige.

1991
02:27:22,636 --> 02:27:24,233
Give them 2 swords. They'll fight and die.

1992
02:27:27,683 --> 02:27:29,564
You are our dads.. and you'll conduct our marriage

1993
02:27:37,217 --> 02:27:38,282
Dear!

1994
02:27:40,872 --> 02:27:47,584
It's ok she met me because both of us have good luck.

1995
02:27:48,114 --> 02:27:50,414
Else you can understand what would have happened to her.

1996
02:27:52,425 --> 02:27:53,978
Don't you know what will happen, if an innocent girl like her..

1997
02:27:54,900 --> 02:28:00,316
..wearing 1 crore worth jewels and will roam along the roads?

1998
02:28:01,377 --> 02:28:02,966
Outside people are like you.

1999
02:28:03,662 --> 02:28:04,684
For money only.

2000
02:28:08,313 --> 02:28:10,981
The minute when I accompanied her..

2001
02:28:12,325 --> 02:28:21,611
..I couldn't tell her bravely.. ÖI am that America groom.

2002
02:28:22,726 --> 02:28:24,961
Because of you only.

2003
02:28:29,436 --> 02:28:31,659
I changed my name as Anand.

2004
02:28:33,940 --> 02:28:36,231
If I tell her she would get scared..

2005
02:28:37,152 --> 02:28:38,728
..or she will do anything to herself..

2006
02:28:39,466 --> 02:28:41,754
..or she will leave me and run away..

2007
02:28:42,524 --> 02:28:45,208
..or she'll think that I too cheated her like you..

2008
02:28:45,394 --> 02:28:46,958
..with this scare, I couldn't tell..

2009
02:29:28,078 --> 02:29:28,876
In-law!

2010
02:29:38,472 --> 02:29:41,816
-In-law! -Hereafter everyone feels happy.

2011
02:30:00,191 --> 02:30:01,368
It's wrong that I lied to you.

2012
02:30:02,153 --> 02:30:04,271
But I couldn't understand what to do.

2013
02:30:04,947 --> 02:30:06,277
I won't lie in my life forward.

2014
02:30:13,436 --> 02:30:14,630
You no need to give dowry.

2015
02:30:15,215 --> 02:30:16,886
There is a big kitchen in our house in America.

2016
02:30:17,031 --> 02:30:19,370
Cook is also there. So you don't need to cook.

2017
02:30:20,076 --> 02:30:22,234
Washing machine is there if you want I'll wash our clothes.

2018
02:30:25,786 --> 02:30:27,344
I am earning very well in America.

2019
02:30:27,638 --> 02:30:29,439
So you need not go for a job.

2020
02:30:30,943 --> 02:30:34,049
My parents also stays in Vijayawada. Hence you don't have their problem.

2021
02:30:35,503 --> 02:30:38,190
Now if you want I'll undergo a check for HIV in this hospital.

2022
02:30:38,363 --> 02:30:39,061
Now immediately..

2023
02:30:39,787 --> 02:30:44,200
Finally, it's ok for me to celebrate our first night on your grandma's roof cot.

2024
02:30:45,757 --> 02:30:47,237
Seems, it does sound good..

2025
02:30:50,211 --> 02:30:51,350
You crazy fellow!

2026
02:30:53,861 --> 02:30:54,787
Do you feel shy?

2027
02:31:25,566 --> 02:31:33,770
Let me become an aroma by hugging you.

2028
02:31:34,297 --> 02:31:42,628
Let you become a hymn by joining me.

2029
02:31:43,289 --> 02:31:47,344
I'll be born everyday as a flower to adorn you.

2030
02:31:47,736 --> 02:31:51,598
I'll become a temple in every foot to rest you in that.

2031
02:31:51,957 --> 02:31:56,106
Let me serve you my whole long life.

2032
02:31:56,202 --> 02:31:59,729
Let me become an aroma by hugging you.

2033
02:32:48,889 --> 02:32:52,530
You are my dawn which wakes me up.

2034
02:32:53,027 --> 02:32:56,775
You are the time when I forget my youth.

2035
02:32:57,584 --> 02:33:01,321
You are the one that gave me fingers to hold to walk.

2036
02:33:01,989 --> 02:33:05,686
You are the king to rule over me by marrying.

2037
02:33:06,647 --> 02:33:10,699
Oh Ramachandra! Free my beauty..

2038
02:33:11,020 --> 02:33:14,667
Oh Syama Sundhara! You are torturing this Radha's mind.

2039
02:33:57,967 --> 02:34:01,550
You are my survivor who got me my love.

2040
02:34:02,292 --> 02:34:05,869
You are the breathing music which I heard.

2041
02:34:06,746 --> 02:34:10,507
You are the person who subsided my anger.

2042
02:34:11,146 --> 02:34:14,918
You are my dear to walk with me on the wedding dais.

2043
02:34:15,728 --> 02:34:19,686
Shall I melt and offer you my youth?

2044
02:34:20,211 --> 02:34:32,457
Shall I offer you my life?

2045
02:34:36,265 --> 02:34:42,746
You are my only..

2046
02:34:45,433 --> 02:34:54,235
You are my only..
