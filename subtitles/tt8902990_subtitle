1
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,958
<span style="style.default_1">Seeing them now you wouldn't guess</span>
<span style="style.default_1">their sex life was once quite active.</span>

2
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:09,416
<span style="style.default_1">I know it's wrong to talk about</span>
<span style="style.default_1">your parents' sex life.</span>

3
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,625
<span style="style.default_1">But the argument about right and wrong</span>
<span style="style.default_1">started ages ago.</span>

4
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,208
<span style="style.default_1">I feel guilty for one thing.</span>

5
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,750
<span style="style.default_1">I was the reason they argued.</span>

6
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:26,000
<span style="style.default_1">Nineteen years ago after marriage</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and two kids,</span>

7
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,166
<span style="style.default_1">their sex life was both active</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and complicated.</span>

8
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,125
Niren!

9
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,208
Niren!

10
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,666
Niren, wake up!

11
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,625
Let me sleep, Aditi. It's Sunday.

12
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,625
Sleep later. I'm so tense right now.
Get up...

13
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,375
Now I'm half awake, thanks.
Let me be, please!

14
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,625
Niren, just look!

15
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,500
I'm pregnant.

16
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,708
How's that possible?

17
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,833
I told you, "Don't be too smart.
Use a condom."

18
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,458
How's this my fault now?

19
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,000
We planned it together.

20
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,375
You said the rhythm method
was scientifically proven.

21
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,208
So you expect me to pop a pill every day?

22
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,041
Even if it makes me dizzy?
How convenient.

23
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,666
You enjoy your oats every morning
while Aditi pops pills.

24
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,916
<span style="style.default_1">What's this racket?</span>

25
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,208
Think of the neighbors.

26
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,375
Nothing, Papa. Sorry.

27
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,958
-Mamma!
-Ishaan is up.

28
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,416
Ishlu, good morning.

29
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:30,208
<span style="style.default_1">On one side, North Delhi's</span>
<span style="style.default_1">karate champion, Niren Chaudhary.</span>

30
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,541
<span style="style.default_1">I called him Panda. Kung Fu Panda.</span>

31
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,416
<span style="style.default_1">On the other, the "almost" Miss India</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from South Delhi,</span>

32
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,958
<span style="style.default_1">my Mummy, Aditi Chaudhary.</span>

33
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,291
<span style="style.default_1">This tyke is my elder brother,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Ishaan Chaudhary.</span>

34
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,291
<span style="style.default_1">I call him Giraffe.</span>

35
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,708
<span style="style.default_1">The poor boy has no idea about</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the hot water his parents are in.</span>

36
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,166
Mom, Ishaan is up.
Please serve him breakfast.

37
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,208
You too come now.
The breakfast is getting cold.

38
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,875
<span style="style.default_1">She was a tigress, but I called her Moose.</span>

39
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,541
<span style="style.default_1">Not the chocolate mousse,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but a soft-hearted animal.</span>

40
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,625
<span style="style.default_1">Google it later.</span>

41
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,125
<span style="style.default_1">Moose was a Hindu.</span>

42
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,541
<span style="style.default_1">Only until two years of marriage.</span>

43
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,791
<span style="style.default_1">Then she had a vision and got converted</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to Christianity.</span>

44
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,958
<span style="style.default_1">Like a true Hindu,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda did not object to her conversion.</span>

45
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:30,833
<span style="style.default_1">But he didn't realize</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that in her reading of the Bible,</span>

46
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,708
<span style="style.default_1">abortion was a sin.</span>

47
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,416
Aditi, we can't risk it again.

48
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,583
Sorry. An abortion is the only option.

49
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,458
What are you saying?
You know I can't do that.

50
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,458
Keep it low, Papa will overhear.

51
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,750
We have Ishaan.
We were lucky to have him.

52
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,625
We don't want any more kids.

53
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,250
We didn't plan this, right?

54
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,583
I know there's a special reason
this child is coming.

55
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:22,041
Stop! I don't believe in all that.

56
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
It's in our hands.

57
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,291
It's your body, so it's your decision.

58
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,750
-What if--
-It's a girl?

59
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,458
What if she's like Tanya?

60
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,666
I don't have the courage, Aditi.

61
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't you feel incomplete without Tanya?

62
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:19,625
<span style="style.default_1">Call her a tigress or a Bible follower,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose always gets her way.</span>

63
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,500
<span style="style.default_1">Moose was an ace emotional blackmailer.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Poor Panda!</span>

64
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,083
<span style="style.default_1">Panda was like Moose's little poodle.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Cute!</span>

65
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,250
<span style="style.default_1">Here I am! Their third harvest!</span>

66
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,875
<span style="style.default_1">I shouldn't be praising myself</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but, what a beauty!</span>

67
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,500
Don't be scared. Have faith in God.

68
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,833
He won't make you suffer again.

69
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,791
We're calling her Aisha.

70
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,458
Aisha means life.

71
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,583
Wow! Perfect name.

72
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,916
Take it from me.
She'll live a hundred years.

73
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,541
You're right, Papa.

74
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,250
Why are you all morose?

75
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,250
Your granddaughter is here.
Smile!

76
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,166
It's not like I flunked in Math again.

77
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,958
Let's celebrate! Sweets for everyone.

78
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,875
You first.

79
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,500
-Yeah, there's my effort too.
-Yeah, of course.

80
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,625
She was destined to come home.

81
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,583
Let's take a picture.

82
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:21,375
-Okay, everyone let's say Aishi.
-Aishi...

83
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,666
<span style="style.default_1">Grandpa had overreacted slightly.</span>

84
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,708
<span style="style.default_1">If I could make it,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">could I tell you this story?</span>

85
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,833
<span style="style.default_1">By the way, my life has ended</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but their story hasn't.</span>

86
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,250
<span style="style.default_1">Just because I'm dead,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">it doesn't mean the story lacks suspense.</span>

87
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,500
<span style="style.default_1">Before I move on, I have a request.</span>

88
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,208
<span style="style.default_1">Please don't imagine me as some ghost.</span>

89
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,666
<span style="style.default_1">I still have killer looks,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but not the scary one.</span>

90
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,500
<span style="style.default_1">Forget about me.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Listen to their story.</span>

91
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,916
<span style="style.default_1">They didn't have the money</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to honeymoon in Nepal,</span>

92
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,083
<span style="style.default_1">but thanks to me, they got to see London.</span>

93
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,833
<span style="style.default_1">London, bro, London!</span>

94
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:23,500
The absence of tonsils
and your family history

95
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:27,708
lead me to conclude
that the Indian doctors were right.

96
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,166
I can't guarantee anything.

97
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,625
But there's a treatment for Aisha.

98
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,750
The best match is a sibling.

99
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,833
We have a son, Ishaan.

100
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,416
Here. This is his blood report.

101
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,208
We'll test you both too.

102
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,291
Of course.

103
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:55,333
With a deficient immune system,
she is prone to infections.

104
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,000
Keep her isolated as much as you can.

105
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,083
The treatment's very expensive.

106
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,875
It could go up to 120,000 pounds.

107
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,291
I have some savings.

108
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,541
Nonsense.
You've already done so much for us.

109
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,958
Hardly! Why are you being so formal?

110
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,250
The bedroom is yours.

111
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,791
No. We're fine here.

112
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,458
<span style="style.default_1">I'm so sorry I'm here without any notice.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">We were in such a hurry...</span>

113
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,875
Even if your dad has to beg,
he won't give up.

114
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:08,583
It'll take time. But we aren't leaving
until you recover.

115
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,875
Until then stay with me, okay?

116
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:27,375
<span style="style.default_1">If it wasn't for me,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">we wouldn't have come to London.</span>

117
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,416
<span style="style.default_1">Panda made the rounds of London</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with his lunch box every day.</span>

118
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,166
<span style="style.default_1">He'd put up posters in shops</span>

119
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,250
<span style="style.default_1">and leave appeals for businessmen.</span>

120
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,458
<span style="style.default_1">It was tough enough</span>
<span style="style.default_1">paying for the flight here.</span>

121
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:50,250
<span style="style.default_1">Now we had to find the price of a trip</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to the moon!</span>

122
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,000
Niren Chaudhary. Sorry, I'm late.
I had to take a train.

123
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,375
Relax! You're not at the BBC.

124
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,333
You may not get big donations.

125
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,791
Even if you get 20,000 pounds,
consider yourself lucky.

126
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,125
Raise your hopes too high
and you'll be disappointed.

127
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,416
And keep it brief.
This is a music program after all.

128
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,250
<span style="style.default_1">This is your host and friend, Arjun Gill,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from Sunrise Radio.</span>

129
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:42,500
<span style="style.default_1">Friends, today I want you to hear</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a heartfelt plea.</span>

130
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:49,375
This year on the 27th of March,
Aisha Chaudhary was born with SCID.

131
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,875
Today we have her father,
Niren Chaudhary, with us in the studio.

132
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,833
Niren, what does SCID mean?

133
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,916
Severe Combined Immune Deficiency.

134
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:07,416
A rare genetic disorder. A baby is born
with a deficient immune system.

135
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,000
It's impossible to fight infections
with this condition.

136
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:19,083
Within a year of their birth,
such children...

137
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,375
I mean if they do not get the treatment...

138
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,875
they won't survive.

139
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:36,708
Our first born, Tanya,
suffered from the same deficiency.

140
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,208
She did not survive.

141
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,416
No, sir. It's okay.

142
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,125
What causes SCID?

143
00:15:55,791 --> 00:16:00,625
My wife, Aditi, and I have a rare gene.

144
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,291
It's a faulty gene.

145
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:09,708
There's a 25% chance
our children will inherit this gene.

146
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:16,833
One in a million couples have this gene.
We happen to be that couple.

147
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:23,833
The doctors say if she doesn't have
a bone marrow transplant in two weeks...

148
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,750
our Aisha won't survive.

149
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,625
Aisha's parents have
managed to collect 60,000 pounds

150
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,083
including their life savings.

151
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:41,458
But they need a whopping 120,000 pounds
in total.

152
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,083
How will they find this amount
to save their Aisha?

153
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,250
Who will help the Chaudhary family?

154
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,541
Who amongst us?

155
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,041
Please help us.

156
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,541
Remember Sheetal Agarwal?

157
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,833
Malvika said she's divorced.

158
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,708
She was nuts about you in college.

159
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,208
Marry her.

160
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,416
Divorce her once you've got
the 120,000 pounds.

161
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,958
That's the cost I'll have to pay
to a divorce lawyer.

162
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:53,208
I'll get you married to Singhania,
the fat owner of Ramjas College.

163
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,208
He must still be single.

164
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,416
Aisha and Ishaan will stay with me.

165
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,750
-You can see them on weekends.
-Stop it!

166
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm sure he'd go on a diet for you.

167
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,625
What do we tell Ishaan?

168
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,166
That his sister has become
a star in the sky?

169
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,208
I should move to my mother's.

170
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,583
Before you and Ishaan get
too attached to her--

171
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,041
No one's going anywhere.

172
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,541
Focus on one thing at a time.

173
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,750
Come on. Goodnight.

174
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,458
Aditi, the doctor's on the line.

175
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,291
Just hold her.

176
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,625
Mrs. Chaudhary...

177
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,625
<span style="style.default_1">the report is a little odd.</span>

178
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,833
-I'd rather not discuss it on the phone.
-You can tell me.

179
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,500
<span style="style.default_1">Niren is not Ishaan's father.</span>

180
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,291
What?

181
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,708
What do you mean "what?"
Obviously, it's a mistake, Niren.

182
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,666
Who else could be Ishaan's father?

183
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,791
We'll have to repeat the tests.

184
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,333
Thank God Anshu is bringing Ishaan here.

185
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,208
He'll be a 100 percent match.

186
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,458
Now even his life is getting disturbed.

187
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,625
If kids don't do well in primary school,

188
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,875
passing the ICSE exam is impossible.

189
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,958
I know. ICSE exams aren't easy.

190
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,791
Who's giving the ICSE test?

191
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,375
Ishaan. When he grows up.
What are you talking about?

192
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,750
I'm suing that hospital.

193
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,458
Converting rupees into pounds
has wiped me out.

194
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,416
What about Ishaan's airfare?

195
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,750
Tell me.

196
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,333
It's nothing, baby. It's a small prick.
Like the tip of a pencil.

197
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,000
Look at Mamma.

198
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,791
Aishi will say,
"My brother Ishaan is so brave.

199
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,916
He didn't even cry."

200
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,083
That's what Aishi will say. Right?

201
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,958
It'll feel like an ant bite.

202
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,416
Sorry, Mamma. Sorry, Dadda.

203
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,125
Ishlu...

204
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,750
You're my brave boy!

205
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,125
Kids from North Delhi don't cry.

206
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,125
-Who don't cry?
-Kids from North Delhi.

207
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:03,458
-What was that about?
-Let's not create a scene.

208
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,291
What scene? No one knows us here.

209
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,250
-Talk in Hindi. Who'll understand?
-Please stop it, Aditi.

210
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,833
What if someone told you
everything you believed was a lie?

211
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,458
How would you feel? Acting so cool.

212
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,416
Don't beat around the bush!
Out with it.

213
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,083
I'm not stupid. I know why Ishaan is okay.
Because he's not my son.

214
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,833
It's obvious.
Tanya and Aisha got SCID from me.

215
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,375
So, it's my fault?

216
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,000
I cheated on you?

217
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:40,291
Take your suspicious, narrow mind
back to North Delhi.

218
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,500
I had no idea your brain
was still stuck on that note!

219
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:47,041
-Must I prove my chastity next?
-There's such a thing as science.

220
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:52,333
Fine! Then sit here and use your science
to judge my character.

221
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,041
If it wasn't for Aisha,
Ishaan would not have been retested.

222
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,791
I've nothing to prove to you,
or to anyone. Go to hell!

223
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:19,708
<span style="style.default_1">They needed money for one kid</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and proof for the other.</span>

224
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,875
<span style="style.default_1">Amidst the crisis,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the one having a blast was Giraffe.</span>

225
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:29,666
<span style="style.default_1">Oblivious to the fact that he may not be</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a Chaudhary after all.</span>

226
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:35,333
<span style="style.default_1">But Uncle Anshu knew.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And yet he gorged.</span>

227
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,541
<span style="style.default_1">London, bro!</span>

228
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:45,750
<span style="style.default_1">I did tell you that their sex life was</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a little complicated.</span>

229
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:50,000
<span style="style.default_1">At least the doctors guaranteed</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was a Chaudhary.</span>

230
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,625
<span style="style.default_1">Or else they would've gone home</span>
<span style="style.default_1">being single.</span>

231
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,208
Sir! Can you do me a favor?

232
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,708
Taxis can't park here.

233
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:01,750
Sure.

234
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,541
There's a baby named Aisha Chaudhary
in the hospital.

235
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,291
Please give this to her father.

236
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,500
-Any news on the money?
-We're trying hard.

237
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,958
We have Ishaan and your blood reports.

238
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:47,958
There was some mix-up
at the Indian hospital, apparently.

239
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:52,416
I'm sure you knew that already.

240
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,791
You are indeed Ishaan's father!

241
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,750
So the reports are in?

242
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,125
I knew it. I always did.

243
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,208
There was no need for a retest.

244
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,416
I told Aditi it was a waste of money
but she never listens.

245
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,500
You know her.

246
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,375
Quick to judge, easy to apologize!

247
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:44,083
You're right to be angry.
I behaved stupidly.

248
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,750
But you're not stupid.

249
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,458
Forgive me now.

250
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,333
<span style="style.default_1">I am sorry.</span>

251
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,375
<span style="style.default_1">I am sorry.</span>

252
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:17,291
<span style="style.default_1">Please forgive me.</span>

253
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,708
<span style="style.default_1">I am sorry.</span>

254
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,333
Sorry.

255
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,416
-How did you find this in London?
-Love has its ways.

256
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,458
Arjun Gill.

257
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,500
<span style="style.default_1">Niren, turn on the radio.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Stay on the line.</span>

258
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,041
-The radio...
-Turn on the radio.

259
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:53,375
<span style="style.default_1">Beloved friends in London,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">this is Arjun Gill from Sunrise Radio.</span>

260
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:56,250
<span style="style.default_1">We're far from our homeland</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but close to the heart.</span>

261
00:25:56,666 --> 00:26:00,125
<span style="style.default_1">Thanks for the donations and prayers</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from your hearts.</span>

262
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:05,083
We have received 250,000 pounds
for baby Aisha Chaudhary!

263
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,666
Oh, good God!

264
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:12,291
<span style="style.default_1">You've donated double the money</span>
<span style="style.default_1">they needed. You have made me proud.</span>

265
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:16,291
<span style="style.default_1">Aisha's father, Niren Chaudhary,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">is on the line.</span>

266
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,458
<span style="style.default_1">Niren, I'd like you to know that</span>

267
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,916
Indian and British listeners
have given generously,

268
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,500
but also people from Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Nepal, Afghanistan

269
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,791
and many other immigrants
have also contributed.

270
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,750
<span style="style.default_1">Would you like to say something?</span>

271
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,375
I'd like to tell them...

272
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,958
You people have treated my daughter
as your own.

273
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,625
I could not have saved her on my own.

274
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:43,375
Now I'm sure she'll live a long life.

275
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,083
Aisha's mother and I want...

276
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:48,291
to give you our heartfelt thanks.

277
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,458
Thank you, Arjun.

278
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,916
<span style="style.default_1">Thank you, Niren.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Goodbye and good luck.</span>

279
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:03,708
<span style="style.default_1">Imagine a room filled with pounds</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from floor to the ceiling.</span>

280
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:11,458
<span style="style.default_1">Two pounds, five pounds and some checks.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Some even sent their piggy banks.</span>

281
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:14,250
<span style="style.default_1">Such people exist!</span>

282
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:18,458
<span style="style.default_1">I couldn't say it then,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so I'll say it now...</span>

283
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,833
<span style="style.default_1">Thank you, Sunrise Radio.</span>

284
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,125
<span style="style.default_1">And thank you, London.</span>

285
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:32,416
<span style="style.default_1">Ishaan and Uncle Anshu's ice-cream party</span>
<span style="style.default_1">was over.</span>

286
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:36,541
<span style="style.default_1">Ishaan turned out to be a Chaudhary.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But his bone marrow didn't match mine.</span>

287
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,500
<span style="style.default_1">This task too was in Panda's fate.</span>

288
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:49,041
Aisha may join your sister, Taanu,
in heaven.

289
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:55,458
<span style="style.default_1">Anyone else might've hidden this news</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from a 4-year-old ice-cream loving kid.</span>

290
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:59,041
<span style="style.default_1">But Moose never hid anything</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from her children.</span>

291
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,666
<span style="style.default_1">Why would she?</span>

292
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,916
<span style="style.default_1">My name had been entered</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in the medical annals of Europe.</span>

293
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,791
<span style="style.default_1">I was the first SCID patient to be given</span>

294
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:11,208
<span style="style.default_1">both a bone marrow</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and stem cell transplant.</span>

295
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,875
-Sorry.
-Thank God you're here.

296
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,541
Hold her.

297
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:20,333
I hope they haven't taken him in yet.
Take care of her.

298
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,125
She's crying a lot today.

299
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:35,583
<span style="style.default_1">It wasn't easy for Panda</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to go through the surgery alone.</span>

300
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:40,125
<span style="style.default_1">But you need practice to run</span>
<span style="style.default_1">between two hospitals.</span>

301
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,958
<span style="style.default_1">If you compare Moose with Milkha Singh,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the sprinter, that's not fair.</span>

302
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,125
Who knows how long will it take
for her new cells to grow.

303
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,125
I should be here with you both.

304
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:21,791
You just watch, Aditi.

305
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:26,875
One day I'll make so much money,
we don't have to worry about anything.

306
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,125
Once Aisha gets well,
we'll rob a bank together.

307
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:43,291
Until then you'll have to be
Ishaan's mamma too.

308
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,625
I hope the chemotherapy
has no side effects.

309
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,208
Bye, Tootsie.

310
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:48,333
Hello. How are you, Mom?

311
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:50,541
I'm fine, dear.
How's Aisha?

312
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,166
<span style="style.default_1">Aisha's fine.</span>

313
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,625
<span style="style.default_1">Has Niren left?</span>

314
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,875
Yes, he just left.

315
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,958
Are you all right?

316
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:58,875
<span style="style.default_1">Yes.</span>

317
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,083
Is Ishaan still up?

318
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,166
As though he ever sleeps!
Ishaan!

319
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,250
-<span style="style.default_1">Mamma!</span>
-Hi, sweetie.

320
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:16,625
Miss Dipti scolded me
and made me stand in the corner.

321
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:17,541
Why?

322
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:22,750
Because I colored the sky pink
in art class.

323
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:27,500
<span style="style.default_1">Mamma, isn't the color of the sky pink?</span>

324
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,458
<span style="style.default_1">Miss Dipti is absolutely wrong.</span>

325
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:34,083
You can paint the sky any color you want.
Always follow your dreams.

326
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:39,666
My friends called me a fool.
They said the sky is blue.

327
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,666
Stop crying and listen to your Mamma.
Okay?

328
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,708
<span style="style.default_1">Miss Dipti...</span>

329
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:48,708
There's no need to change the color
of your sky for anyone. Ever.

330
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:50,250
<span style="style.default_1">Okay?</span>

331
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,500
Everyone has their own sky.

332
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:54,541
Understand?

333
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:58,458
I painted my sky the color I wanted.

334
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:02,916
If you believe your sky is pink,
then it's pink.

335
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:05,250
That's it.

336
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:09,416
Guess what I sent for you with Dadda?

337
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,166
Train!

338
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,208
Mamma loves you, Ishlu...

339
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,708
and your pink sky.

340
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,708
Bye, Mamma.

341
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:24,708
Bye, son.

342
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:42,166
<span style="style.default_1">I always thought Moose loved Giraffe</span>
<span style="style.default_1">more than me.</span>

343
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,875
<span style="style.default_1">Giraffe believed the opposite.</span>

344
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:49,375
<span style="style.default_1">Honestly, I was more eligible</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for a full-time care.</span>

345
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,916
Here comes the big plane.

346
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:56,541
And who's flying in it?

347
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,708
And the plane flies like...

348
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:12,500
<span style="style.default_1">Hospital psychiatrist recommended Moose</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to send home videos of our lives.</span>

349
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:17,041
<span style="style.default_1">That was the start</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of my first modeling gig.</span>

350
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:24,166
<span style="style.default_1">We came to London for my treatment.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But Moose ended up being the patient.</span>

351
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:26,291
<span style="style.default_1">Head, shoulder, knees and toes.</span>

352
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:33,583
What's this?

353
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:37,000
-Shoulder.
-That's your shoulder?

354
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,000
I'm going to show you our London home.

355
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:45,000
My tiny cupboard, Aishi's pram.

356
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,416
We must keep it covered
so no germs or bacteria get through.

357
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,333
Our weekly planner.

358
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,541
On these days we go to the hospital...

359
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:56,500
<span style="style.default_1">If Moose hadn't made these videos,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">she would've sunk into depression.</span>

360
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:00,708
<span style="style.default_1">I was taking the injections</span>
<span style="style.default_1">while Moose missed Giraffe.</span>

361
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:05,416
<span style="style.default_1">Not that Giraffe was dying to watch me!</span>

362
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:13,291
Aishi! Look, the plane
has landed from Delhi...

363
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,250
Wow! She's started to walk.

364
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,666
<span style="style.default_1">Niren, see that?</span>

365
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:48,375
<span style="style.default_1">After eight years of marriage,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">this was their first time apart.</span>

366
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,833
<span style="style.default_1">Moose was counting the days.</span>

367
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:53,708
<span style="style.default_1">Cuteness has its limits.</span>

368
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,125
<span style="style.default_1">And babies are a mess.</span>

369
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,250
<span style="style.default_1">But my Moose never gave up.</span>

370
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,041
<span style="style.default_1">She had no option.</span>

371
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:21,583
Come, baby.

372
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,125
<span style="style.default_1">Hi. Where are you?</span>

373
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:37,166
Buying stuff for the house.

374
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:40,416
It's freezing here.
My hands are frozen.

375
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:47,083
What are you doing? Has Ishaan eaten?
Give him the phone.

376
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,291
He's at your Mom's.

377
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:53,125
-How come?
-<span style="style.default_1">My parents are in Jammu.</span>

378
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,875
So I made lunch plans.

379
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:56,250
Who's coming over?

380
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,125
Sonia, Ishaan's--

381
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,208
<span style="style.default_1">Who's this Sonia?</span>

382
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,333
Sir.

383
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:01,791
Put it upstairs.

384
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,333
We met a few times at Ishaan's school.

385
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:07,166
<span style="style.default_1">She's going through a divorce</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and wanted some advice.</span>

386
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,291
Hang on! What do you know about divorce?

387
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,125
<span style="style.default_1">Either she's fooling you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">or you're fooling me.</span>

388
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,291
Why solve her problems?

389
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:22,333
<span style="style.default_1">Are you some expert on divorce?</span>

390
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:24,916
Are you blind?
Can't you see what this is about?

391
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,500
<span style="style.default_1">Cozying up to a single dad.</span>

392
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:30,208
Aditi, telling you anything is dangerous.

393
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,208
How am I a single dad?

394
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,708
She should know her rights.

395
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:36,708
We're just discussing that.

396
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:38,291
Are you a divorce lawyer now?

397
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:41,458
<span style="style.default_1">A social worker?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">What's she paying you?</span>

398
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,125
Actually, what are you wearing?

399
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,458
What are you wearing?

400
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:52,083
A shirt and jeans.
What do you expect?

401
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,000
Which shirt?

402
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,291
The purple one.

403
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,250
Oh! Your cool shirt?

404
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,791
So, you want to impress her
with your dude shirt?

405
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,041
Niren, if you wear that shirt--

406
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,125
I'm not changing.
Nonsense!

407
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:07,125
<span style="style.default_1">I doubted you.</span>

408
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,625
I was wrong.
Are you taking revenge now?

409
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:13,458
-Come on, Aditi. Rise above it.
-Rise above it?

410
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,875
Should I rise above the world too?

411
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:19,208
-Your guest has arrived.
-I'm off. She's here.

412
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:20,916
<span style="style.default_1">Don't you dare hang up!</span>

413
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,666
-Hi, Sonia.
-"Hi, Sonia!"

414
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:27,458
Tell her your mother's ill
and you have to see her. Now!

415
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,541
I'll call tomorrow. I'm hanging up.

416
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,416
<span style="style.default_1">Sheela, Sushma, Mamta.</span>

417
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:41,791
<span style="style.default_1">None of these names would've</span>
<span style="style.default_1">stirred Moose's suspicions.</span>

418
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:43,375
<span style="style.default_1">But Sonia!</span>

419
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:47,208
<span style="style.default_1">There's so much oomph in that name,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">even the Prime Minister gets shaken.</span>

420
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,416
<span style="style.default_1">Before they got married, Panda was ready</span>

421
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,333
<span style="style.default_1">to crawl through the phone line</span>
<span style="style.default_1">into Moose's arms.</span>

422
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,750
Let's get married.

423
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:00,166
How much longer must I kiss
this damn phone goodnight?

424
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,916
How many people in your neighborhood
must I seek permission to marry?

425
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,333
<span style="style.default_1">Uncle, Aunty, Papa...</span>

426
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:09,125
the milkman, the newspaper man,
the baker...

427
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,208
Don't flaunt your upper class
South Delhi attitude.

428
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,208
You used to once like my family values.

429
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:22,500
<span style="style.default_1">And now they are anathema to you!</span>

430
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:24,500
<span style="style.default_1">Listen...</span>

431
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,416
Why don't you talk to your family?

432
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:31,958
I'm not afraid of anyone.

433
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:36,083
I could come over and even talk
to your parents.

434
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:42,458
You're dangerous. In a sexy way.

435
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:51,916
-Sexy?
-Chaudhary!

436
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:58,583
Papa! You?

437
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:02,125
What's up? Can't you sleep?

438
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:05,083
I'm sending her father our phone bill.
Go to sleep!

439
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,208
Something wrong with you boys.

440
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:13,375
<span style="style.default_1">Grandpa was worried about the phone bill.</span>

441
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,500
<span style="style.default_1">There were many places in Delhi</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for romancing. Lodhi Gardens,</span>

442
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:22,500
<span style="style.default_1">Hauz Khas Lake, Majnu's Tila,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but at night none were open.</span>

443
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,958
<span style="style.default_1">That night Panda was deprived of</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Moose's goodnight kisses.</span>

444
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,583
<span style="style.default_1">Panda was scared of Grandpa...</span>

445
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:31,416
<span style="style.default_1">but not as much as of Moose!</span>

446
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:35,333
<span style="style.default_1">No girl had entered the Chaudhary home</span>
<span style="style.default_1">before marriage.</span>

447
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,708
<span style="style.default_1">And Moose loved a challenge. So...</span>

448
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,708
Put your helmet down.

449
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,791
<span style="style.default_1">The only thought in Panda's head</span>
<span style="style.default_1">was the bedroom.</span>

450
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:52,916
<span style="style.default_1">He didn't know Moose had planned to see</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the whole house.</span>

451
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,500
<span style="style.default_1">These lanes</span>

452
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:01,708
<span style="style.default_1">These alleys</span>

453
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:08,125
<span style="style.default_1">These lanes</span>
<span style="style.default_1">These alleys</span>

454
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:14,500
<span style="style.default_1">Longer than hope</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Deeper than faith</span>

455
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:19,666
<span style="style.default_1">These winding lanes</span>

456
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,916
<span style="style.default_1">Intriguing are the paths of the heart</span>

457
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:29,375
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

458
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,708
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

459
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:35,458
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

460
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:40,666
<span style="style.default_1">O heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Why impose conditions?</span>

461
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,541
<span style="style.default_1">O heart</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Why stir feelings?</span>

462
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:46,250
<span style="style.default_1">Why make me cry?</span>

463
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,250
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

464
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:51,416
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

465
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,291
My great-grandma used to make
chili pickle here.

466
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,750
Looks like it's my turn!

467
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,916
Shall I crush you into a pickle?

468
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,750
-You're so cheap!
-That's true.

469
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:08,250
-Technique matters, you know.
-Technique's nothing.

470
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:12,791
-I could father a cricket team in one go.
-Really? Isn't the stadium a bit small?

471
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:15,166
So I need less of a run up!

472
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,041
Gutsy, eh?
Let's stop hiding then.

473
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:21,125
<span style="style.default_1">I feel a little apprehension</span>

474
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:27,208
<span style="style.default_1">As I make my way through</span>
<span style="style.default_1">This old house alone, fearful</span>

475
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:32,291
<span style="style.default_1">What is there to fear?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I'm right here</span>

476
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:37,375
<span style="style.default_1">There are new hearts</span>
<span style="style.default_1">In this old house</span>

477
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,916
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

478
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,041
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

479
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:48,000
<span style="style.default_1">I want to fly a kite from every terrace</span>

480
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:53,416
<span style="style.default_1">My heart wants to soar in the sky</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Free, without judgment</span>

481
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,291
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

482
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:58,875
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't watch my first Bollywood film,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I heard it.</span>

483
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:02,166
<span style="style.default_1">When Moose went to watch</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Shah Rukh Khan in "DDLJ."</span>

484
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:05,958
<span style="style.default_1">Our family tradition was to sing hymns</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to a fetus.</span>

485
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,666
<span style="style.default_1">Instead I heard the famous line,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">"Go, Simran! Go, live your life."</span>

486
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:14,750
<span style="style.default_1">If you have a lovely dream</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Make sure to share it with me</span>

487
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:19,625
<span style="style.default_1">You fill my eyes</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Let me sleep in your arms</span>

488
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:21,750
Niren, how are you?

489
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:28,250
Fixing the antenna.

490
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,208
A lot more needs fixing here!

491
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,375
My mother misses you.
Come over.

492
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:34,833
I miss her too!

493
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:39,208
<span style="style.default_1">My heart is spinning</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It never stops</span>

494
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:45,083
<span style="style.default_1">It can't hear, does not listen</span>
<span style="style.default_1">To a single word I say</span>

495
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:47,333
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

496
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,166
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

497
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:52,250
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

498
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:54,000
<span style="style.default_1">The heart is a heart after all</span>

499
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:14,333
<span style="style.default_1">When people marry out of caste,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the society judges them.</span>

500
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:20,333
<span style="style.default_1">People would tell Grandpa that</span>
<span style="style.default_1">my SCID was caused by their love marriage.</span>

501
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,500
<span style="style.default_1">Now what has SCID got to do with it?</span>

502
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:25,833
<span style="style.default_1">But Sonia...</span>

503
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:30,333
<span style="style.default_1">The name had so much oomph that Moose</span>
<span style="style.default_1">stopped picking up Panda's calls.</span>

504
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:34,208
<span style="style.default_1">Moose knew exactly how to extract</span>
<span style="style.default_1">an apology.</span>

505
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:16,250
Look who's here!

506
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:20,000
Aishi, how are you?

507
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:26,708
I've been calling you for five days.

508
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,458
Why didn't you pick up?

509
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:32,625
I didn't hear it ring. Try again.

510
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:34,958
Haven't slept for days.

511
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,333
I can't share you.

512
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,791
You must solve only my problems. Okay?

513
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:48,416
Besides you...

514
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:52,458
who would I want to impress?

515
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:58,750
This long-distance relationship
isn't working, Aditi.

516
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:01,458
So I've got a transfer.

517
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:02,958
-Really?
-Yes.

518
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:11,041
Ishaan and your mother are arriving
in two days.

519
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:15,916
I talked to his teacher and said
we'd be away for six months.

520
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,916
And not to give his seat to anyone.

521
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:21,791
Remember we queued up at 5 a.m.
for his admission?

522
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:25,666
Careful, your mother has sent parathas
and pickle for you.

523
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:31,125
-Not six months, Niren.
-Six or eight. We'll see.

524
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:33,666
We can take a buffer of
a couple of months.

525
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:37,166
Ten years.

526
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:42,875
Are you kidding?

527
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:55,000
It'll take time for the T cells
to grow in her body.

528
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:58,875
And until they do, her body is a war zone.

529
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:02,958
Even going to the airport could be
life-threatening. She could collapse.

530
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:07,541
For us, it's just ten years, Niren.

531
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:11,416
For her, it's her entire life.

532
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:28,791
<span style="style.default_1">O life!</span>

533
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:35,375
<span style="style.default_1">You played a game of heads and tails</span>

534
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:50,625
Come, Ishlu, bath time.
Mamma has to go to work.

535
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:52,958
<span style="style.default_1">O life!</span>

536
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:59,291
<span style="style.default_1">You played a game of heads and tails</span>

537
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:02,166
<span style="style.default_1">Sometimes the nights are full</span>

538
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:07,291
<span style="style.default_1">Other times the days are empty</span>

539
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:09,875
It'll only take five minutes.

540
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:14,125
Aisha's crying too.
Let me bathe you quickly.

541
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:15,875
Dadda's just coming.

542
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,083
-Hello!
-Dadda!

543
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:19,208
What took you so long?

544
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:21,708
You know it's hard alone.

545
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:23,333
I wasn't partying.

546
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,125
It's okay, baby.

547
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,458
Tootsie...

548
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:35,916
Imagine if we had a cricket team!

549
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,291
Go to Dadda.

550
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:47,375
<span style="style.default_1">O life, every day you give us</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Sustenance to live</span>

551
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,750
<span style="style.default_1">You count all the breaths</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You give us to breathe</span>

552
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:59,791
<span style="style.default_1">It feels so empty</span>

553
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:03,666
<span style="style.default_1">Even when you're in a crowd</span>

554
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,166
How did you get hurt?

555
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,500
John pushed me at school.

556
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:14,291
-Why did John push you?
-He called me a Paki.

557
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:28,458
<span style="style.default_1">Sometimes you soothe us</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Other times you scare us</span>

558
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:33,625
And then he slipped into a dream...

559
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:38,291
<span style="style.default_1">Sometimes you soothe us</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Other times you scare us</span>

560
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:45,041
<span style="style.default_1">You keep the lamp of hope burning</span>

561
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:51,916
<span style="style.default_1">For so long have we endured</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The pain you inflicted</span>

562
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:55,250
<span style="style.default_1">O life!</span>

563
00:49:55,916 --> 00:50:01,208
<span style="style.default_1">You played a game of heads and tails</span>

564
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:04,833
<span style="style.default_1">Sometimes the nights are full</span>

565
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:09,541
<span style="style.default_1">Other times the days are empty</span>

566
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:17,041
<span style="style.default_1">You played a game of heads and tails</span>

567
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:22,875
<span style="style.default_1">Hearing my high-pitched cries you'd think</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was the main cause of their woes.</span>

568
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:25,458
<span style="style.default_1">And Giraffe was the good child.</span>

569
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:35,333
<span style="style.default_1">But what I can confirm is the smartest</span>
<span style="style.default_1">family member was Moose.</span>

570
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,666
<span style="style.default_1">She had backed the right horse.</span>

571
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,666
<span style="style.default_1">It took 13 years, but Panda minted money.</span>

572
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:44,041
<span style="style.default_1">Without robbing a bank!</span>

573
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:51,958
<span style="style.default_1">Moose, the Moosical!</span>

574
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:02,750
<span style="style.default_1">Moosical was absolutely clear.</span>

575
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:08,000
<span style="style.default_1">When life hands you lemons,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you make lemonade!</span>

576
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:10,375
<span style="style.default_1">But we differed in our tastes.</span>

577
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:19,416
<span style="style.default_1">The main villain of this story.</span>

578
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,375
<span style="style.default_1">The doctors told them to keep me away</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from crowds.</span>

579
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:32,250
<span style="style.default_1">So Moose moved us to a London suburb.</span>

580
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:35,625
<span style="style.default_1">Too much, right?</span>

581
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:38,833
<span style="style.default_1">Would a germ dare take on Moose?</span>

582
00:51:39,416 --> 00:51:43,958
<span style="style.default_1">But Moose had decided so.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">"Chaudhary family, about turn!"</span>

583
00:51:58,291 --> 00:52:01,125
<span style="style.default_1">When people visit London,</span>

584
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:04,708
<span style="style.default_1">they go to Buckingham Palace,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">London Eye, Big Ben.</span>

585
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:09,791
<span style="style.default_1">But me? I was more partial</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to Great Ormond Street Hospital.</span>

586
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:19,000
Aishi.

587
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:22,375
They are here. I'll have her call you.

588
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:27,375
Aisha, please, the dog could give you
an infection. Get off!

589
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:30,833
Can't you two see?

590
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:33,750
What's the big deal?
Anyway her allergy level is 3/10.

591
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:35,166
It won't kill me.

592
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:41,875
Okay. Let's go inside.

593
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:44,250
We'll check your blood reports first.

594
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,125
What good will that do?

595
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:50,791
I'm either lacking in T cells or B cells.
I'm done with this immunity program.

596
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:53,250
-To hell with the blood reports.
-Aishi!

597
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,125
Come.

598
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:57,541
Come. It's okay.

599
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,583
<span style="style.default_1">Every six months, I'd show up</span>
<span style="style.default_1">at the hospital...</span>

600
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:09,958
<span style="style.default_1">to consult my horoscope.</span>

601
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:14,750
<span style="style.default_1">Even 13 years later,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">our lives were running in slow motion.</span>

602
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:18,916
<span style="style.default_1">Everyone would try acting casual...</span>

603
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:22,791
<span style="style.default_1">but as we entered the hospital,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">we were holding our breath.</span>

604
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,791
<span style="style.default_1">The exam was mine,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but the tension of failure was theirs.</span>

605
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:37,708
They've lost it.

606
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:43,083
You too!

607
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:46,291
Can you imagine?
I can't believe it.

608
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,875
Aisha's absolutely fine.
Her test results are good.

609
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:52,833
She'll have a life like you and I do.

610
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,500
-Pinch me!
-Once you...

611
00:53:56,541 --> 00:54:00,000
Once you fix your mind on something,
it's done.

612
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:03,208
I didn't do it alone. We did it.

613
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:06,791
Are you done?

614
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,583
-I've been promoted.
-What?

615
00:54:16,583 --> 00:54:19,125
We must move back to India.
Country Head.

616
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:24,750
-But how can we move now?
-It's a huge offer.

617
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:29,250
Aisha's tests are normal.
For how long will we stay here?

618
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:36,125
I've talked to my boss.

619
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:39,458
Are you asking me? Or telling me?

620
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:41,750
Not asking or telling.

621
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:44,041
We're discussing it.

622
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:49,083
The past 13 years have been difficult
in terms of career.

623
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:51,791
And it's no fun here.

624
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,583
I know.

625
00:54:57,375 --> 00:55:00,291
-But if we have to come back...
-Then we will.

626
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,833
No one's seizing our passports.

627
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:13,000
<span style="style.default_1">Poor Moose. Just when she could've</span>
<span style="style.default_1">had a normal life in London...</span>

628
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:15,833
<span style="style.default_1">Panda said we were going home.</span>

629
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:21,458
<span style="style.default_1">In London it was the burbs.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Now it's the back of beyond in Delhi!</span>

630
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:27,916
<span style="style.default_1">We had a private swimming pool,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but give me the city any day.</span>

631
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,208
<span style="style.default_1">I felt I was like Mowgli!</span>

632
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:38,750
<span style="style.default_1">But the highlight for me was</span>
<span style="style.default_1">not being home-schooled anymore.</span>

633
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:44,250
<span style="style.default_1">I felt I was entering the sequel</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of my life through these gates.</span>

634
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:51,125
<span style="style.default_1">In the name of learning Hindi,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I binged on Bollywood movies.</span>

635
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,291
<span style="style.default_1">It was show time!</span>

636
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:56,833
-Aaa...
-Aamir Khan!

637
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:03,166
"Babes, talented kids like you..."

638
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:06,708
"are like bubbles in a soda bottle."

639
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:08,916
"You rise one by one."

640
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:14,750
As Kareena said,

641
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:18,666
"If you're gawking at me instead
of working, it's not my problem!"

642
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:22,125
Gym class today!

643
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:25,875
Half of you go this way,
the other half that way.

644
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:29,250
You ought to be on a talent show.

645
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:31,833
Do you ever study? Or is this it?

646
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:35,416
I'm the school's entertainment show.

647
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:38,666
Karan.

648
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:40,250
Aisha.

649
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,333
Okay, Aisha, see you later.

650
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:49,750
<span style="style.default_1">That was the first time</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I noticed Karan's eyebrows.</span>

651
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:54,875
<span style="style.default_1">I was a good student but I became</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a better one when I met Karan.</span>

652
00:56:55,833 --> 00:57:00,375
<span style="style.default_1">I wanted to study Karan's history,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Karan's geography... every inch of him.</span>

653
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:05,083
<span style="style.default_1">Fun fact... I didn't wash my hands after</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I shook hands with him.</span>

654
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:08,291
<span style="style.default_1">All thanks to "rajma-chawal</span>"...

655
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:12,291
<span style="style.default_1">the CEO of India's biggest</span>
<span style="style.default_1">pizza company's favorite dish.</span>

656
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:17,458
<span style="style.default_1">If Panda had told Moose</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he missed Delhi's "rajma-chawal"...</span>

657
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:18,958
<span style="style.default_1">she would've exploded.</span>

658
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:23,916
<span style="style.default_1">And Giraffe?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">For some people, getting a girlfriend</span>

659
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,583
<span style="style.default_1">was as tough as waking up early.</span>

660
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:29,083
<span style="style.default_1">If they make it, they're sorted.</span>

661
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,583
<span style="style.default_1">Did he have to be my brother?</span>

662
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:35,958
<span style="style.default_1">Dengue fever claims lives in Delhi.</span>

663
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:38,750
<span style="style.default_1">Dengue spreads through the capital city.</span>

664
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:39,916
Santoshi!

665
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,416
I told you! Don't wash Aisha's plates
with tap water. Use boiled water.

666
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:49,458
Fruits, vegetables or plates.
Wash everything with boiled water. Please.

667
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:51,083
She's fragile.

668
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,541
Jeet, don't cut vegetables without gloves.

669
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:56,583
Remember? Gloves are a must.

670
00:57:56,666 --> 00:57:58,666
Please wear them.

671
00:57:58,916 --> 00:58:02,541
<span style="style.default_1">Dengue mosquitoes breed</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in clean water too.</span>

672
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:05,208
Jeet, we'll have to fumigate
the farmhouse.

673
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,875
<span style="style.default_1">Dengue mosquitoes can survive</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from July to October.</span>

674
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:22,666
Hi, beautiful. You're looking lovely.

675
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,625
Sit here.

676
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:44,166
Come. Sit here.

677
00:58:56,541 --> 00:58:57,625
Thanks, Moose.

678
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,250
My baby. It's the Tree of Life.

679
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:19,666
<span style="style.default_1">You're so innocent</span>

680
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,333
<span style="style.default_1">O my innocent one</span>

681
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:27,750
<span style="style.default_1">Your innocent ways</span>

682
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:31,000
<span style="style.default_1">Take my breath away</span>

683
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,958
<span style="style.default_1">You're so innocent</span>

684
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:39,958
<span style="style.default_1">O my innocent one</span>

685
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:43,041
<span style="style.default_1">Your innocent ways</span>

686
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:46,416
<span style="style.default_1">Take my breath away</span>

687
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:52,041
<span style="style.default_1">Your innocent ways bewilder me</span>

688
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,958
<span style="style.default_1">Your child-like ways</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Take my breath away</span>

689
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:59,708
<span style="style.default_1">You surprise me still</span>

690
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:02,916
<span style="style.default_1">With your childish ways</span>

691
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,666
<span style="style.default_1">Your childish ways</span>

692
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:33,583
<span style="style.default_1">Now that you have stolen my heart</span>

693
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:40,083
<span style="style.default_1">Don't turn away from me, darling</span>

694
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:46,458
<span style="style.default_1">You have changed my life</span>

695
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:52,875
<span style="style.default_1">Don't you now change</span>

696
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:57,916
<span style="style.default_1">You took away my heart</span>

697
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:01,500
<span style="style.default_1">O my heart</span>

698
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:03,791
<span style="style.default_1">O my heart</span>

699
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:05,708
I just knew...

700
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,291
Mom! Dad!

701
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:09,333
Mom!

702
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,916
That's Ishaan.

703
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,541
<span style="style.default_1">Ishaan!</span>

704
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:18,083
-Quick!
-What happened?

705
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:23,916
What's wrong?

706
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,208
Mamma's here. What happened?

707
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:29,000
She was just lying here.

708
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:32,083
Lift her up.

709
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,750
-Aishi, turn the TV off.
-One minute.

710
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:38,458
Are you guys getting a divorce?

711
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:41,541
If you are, then I'm living with you.
Moose drives me nuts.

712
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:45,333
It's about your lungs.

713
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,583
You have something called
Busulfan lung damage.

714
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:03,166
It's led to a condition called
Pulmonary Fibrosis.

715
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,916
-Have you seen the pollution in Delhi?
-That's not the cause.

716
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,208
It's the side effects of chemo.

717
01:03:16,666 --> 01:03:18,791
But that was 14 years ago, right?

718
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:23,916
We knew the side effects of chemo
could show up years later.

719
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,666
But we had no choice, Aishi.

720
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:36,750
How long does it take to cure
this Pulmonary Fibrosis?

721
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,583
It's a serious condition.

722
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,083
There's no cure yet. But...

723
01:03:54,666 --> 01:03:57,541
the doctors have said with good care--

724
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,166
You mean I'm going to die?

725
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,041
Answer me, Moose.

726
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:42,708
<span style="style.default_1">Moose knew there was a chance</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I'd be born with SCID and die young.</span>

727
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,541
<span style="style.default_1">So, should she have aborted me?</span>

728
01:04:52,416 --> 01:04:57,875
<span style="style.default_1">Moose had no words to say for six months</span>
<span style="style.default_1">after my death.</span>

729
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:03,208
<span style="style.default_1">And Panda refused to talk about it.</span>

730
01:05:06,166 --> 01:05:11,666
<span style="style.default_1">So when his London office called,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda's answer was obvious.</span>

731
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
You made a very wise decision
to move back to London.

732
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,708
It won't be easy. I know.

733
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:27,791
We also have been through this situation.
We know exactly how you feel.

734
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:37,125
As you know, Vivek's mother passed away
a month after Aisha died.

735
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:39,416
She was only 73.

736
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:47,041
Running from pillar to post.
The treatments, doctors, hospitals,

737
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,166
we did it all.

738
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:51,333
To no avail.

739
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:53,458
If you just excuse me, I'll be right back.

740
01:05:58,291 --> 01:06:01,750
Let's order. Or I'll faint out of hunger.

741
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:05,583
-Should I go check on her?
-No, it's okay. She'll be fine.

742
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,541
My wife's right there... can I?

743
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:27,250
Please move outside.

744
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:29,291
Just two minutes, please.

745
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:41,333
Is her mother-in-law's death
and Aisha's the same?

746
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:43,625
Obviously not.

747
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,125
Leave it now.

748
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:49,541
Once we move to London,
she'll be out of our hair.

749
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:51,916
I'm not going anywhere, Niren.

750
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,708
What are you saying?

751
01:06:54,791 --> 01:07:00,583
Have you thought about Aisha's clothes?
Do we take them? Or throw them out?

752
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,041
What if her paintings get damaged?

753
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,250
And her school bag?

754
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:09,208
Do I junk her books?

755
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,000
-Stop it, Aditi.
-Why should I?

756
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:16,250
I will not leave Aisha alone here.

757
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:18,250
London is Aisha's home too.

758
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,833
I can't live without you.

759
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,041
-For how long do I keep following you?
-I came to London for you.

760
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:36,333
You didn't come for me.
You came for Aisha.

761
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:39,333
And even if you did, so what?

762
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,416
What are you implying?

763
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,833
You came for your family.
Want a medal?

764
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:48,333
If it's too much, why marry?
You could've escaped all this.

765
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:51,916
What has gotten into you?
Making a mountain out of a molehill.

766
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,708
We were just ordering dinner.

767
01:07:53,791 --> 01:07:57,416
Then go and eat!
Your food must be getting cold.

768
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:02,708
I don't know who I'm talking to sometimes.
Do I even know you?

769
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:07,041
What have I been doing
for the last 20 years?

770
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,000
Looked after Aisha, 24/7.

771
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:13,500
And now that I'm 50, what am I left with?

772
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:15,166
She's gone.

773
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:18,125
Ishaan's busy with his life
as he should be. But you?

774
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:22,458
You're all busy.

775
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:25,333
Where's all this coming from?

776
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:27,708
I'm always here for you.

777
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,375
What do I have except my work?
Are you there for me?

778
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:33,666
I'm not. That's just it.

779
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:39,208
I don't know how to be there
for anyone but Aisha.

780
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:42,375
Why are you running away, Niren?

781
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:44,583
Stop for a moment.

782
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:48,416
Talk to yourself. Talk to me.
To Aisha.

783
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:53,125
-So what if she's dead? Chapter closed?
-Look, do what's right.

784
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:57,375
I did what I could...
You of course think I did nothing.

785
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:00,541
Because you did everything for Aisha,
not me.

786
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:09,583
It's the limit.

787
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:14,000
How easily you say we should live apart.

788
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:30,375
<span style="style.default_1">If I had my way, I'd rewind life</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and change every scene.</span>

789
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:37,708
<span style="style.default_1">Fun fact is I can neither rewind life now</span>
<span style="style.default_1">nor could I then.</span>

790
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:12,125
<span style="style.default_1">When the doctors said</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I had five years more to live...</span>

791
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:15,833
<span style="style.default_1">Moose fast forwarded</span>
<span style="style.default_1">her feelings of sadness.</span>

792
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:21,541
Ishaan, sir?

793
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:25,333
Sir?

794
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:28,708
Ma'am's calling you.

795
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:31,958
She wants you to hurry up.

796
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,791
-What is it?
-Put your shoes on. Hurry!

797
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,916
-Why?
-Because I said so.

798
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,291
Where to, Mamma?

799
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:51,291
We'll have a fifth family member!

800
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,583
We're adopting.

801
01:10:57,083 --> 01:11:00,958
I want you two to meet him
before your Dad does.

802
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:16,708
Ishaan, Aisha!
I'm waiting in the car. Now!

803
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:26,041
-Hi, Tara.
-Hi, Aditi. How are you?

804
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:31,250
-What's his name?
-Vivan.

805
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:34,000
And the other babies?

806
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:37,166
-We've come to pick ours. So excited!
-They're at the back.

807
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:39,291
What's Moose up to?

808
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:41,125
-Let's go?
-Yeah.

809
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:42,958
Come on.

810
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:48,958
We're a family of five now!

811
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:56,166
Go see which one you like.

812
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:07,708
Mom.

813
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:11,916
You made such a fuss about a dog
in London.

814
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,833
You said Aisha was allergic.
Now you're getting her a puppy?

815
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,208
She can take anti-allergy pills.

816
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:21,666
Now the risk is greater.

817
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:25,958
There's a risk in everything, Ishaan.

818
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,916
Besides nothing matters to me
more than her happiness.

819
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:34,125
Rolo!

820
01:12:35,708 --> 01:12:36,666
Moose!

821
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:40,416
Did you hear me? He's my Rolo.

822
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:45,083
It's okay if I die now.

823
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,000
Come, let's meet Rolo.

824
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,708
Aishi, bring Rolo outside.
He'll break something in there.

825
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:58,708
Coming!

826
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:09,166
Your grandma is scared of dogs.

827
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,000
Let's show her.

828
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:13,708
No! Get away!

829
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,791
He won't bite.

830
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:22,625
All three of us lived here.

831
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,958
Now look at you, spoilt rich brat.

832
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,625
You can say that now.

833
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:36,708
When we moved to London,
I thought Dadda would sell my toys.

834
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:41,125
I thought I'd have to earn money
for Aishi's operation.

835
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:44,333
But they were good days, Mom.

836
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:51,041
You know I didn't keep you away
from us on purpose?

837
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:53,333
I know.

838
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:05,916
You know that boy in your class...

839
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,500
What's his name? Karan.

840
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,166
You know everyone's name?

841
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:12,333
I know everything!

842
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:15,458
Aisha has a crush on him.

843
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:18,166
How do you know?
Checking our phones?

844
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,583
Haven't checked yours yet.

845
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:22,875
Tell you what...

846
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,791
ask Karan to take Aishi on a date.

847
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:28,041
How on earth

848
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:32,958
did you concoct this stupid,
ridiculous, weird plan, Mom?

849
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:37,416
If Aishi finds out we've set up
a date for her, she'd go ballistic.

850
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,458
Who'll tell her?

851
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:41,583
Do as I say. Or I'll do it.

852
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:46,916
Aisha thinks he likes her too.

853
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:49,375
And maybe he does.

854
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:51,583
Or maybe because of her illness...

855
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:52,958
I don't know.

856
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:57,125
But there's no harm in asking.
Worst case, he'll say no.

857
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,708
You'll be marrying her off soon!

858
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,166
If only I could, Ishaan.

859
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:12,125
You're an ace at emotional blackmail.

860
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:19,000
Tell me... do you and Karan...

861
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:25,791
Does he brush his teeth regularly?
If he does, no harm kissing him.

862
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:28,958
-He's just a friend.
-It's just a kiss.

863
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:30,375
Look at this sweater.

864
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,083
I hope they've got my size.

865
01:15:34,166 --> 01:15:35,000
Look.

866
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,833
They don't.

867
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:40,375
Excuse me.

868
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,333
One second, ma'am.

869
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:46,250
-Yes, ma'am.
-Do you have a small?

870
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,958
-It should be on the rack.
-It's not. I checked.

871
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:52,625
Maybe it's out of stock.
You'll have to order it.

872
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:54,916
Here's a small.

873
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,250
Ma'am, you can't take that off.

874
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:58,416
Why not?

875
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:02,208
Ma'am, you just can't. Store policy.

876
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:06,000
We do have other styles.
Please have a look.

877
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,250
Moose, it's not that great.

878
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:16,791
Let's go. Come on.

879
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:31,500
-What are you doing?
-Keep an eye out.

880
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:39,333
Must you prove to the world
that you're crazy?

881
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:41,708
Tell me if someone's coming.

882
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:51,708
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you need any help?

883
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:55,208
-No, thank you.
-Please call me if you do.

884
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:02,458
Moose, hurry up!

885
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:20,791
Come.

886
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:28,833
Aishi, don't go beyond kissing,
I'm telling you.

887
01:17:28,916 --> 01:17:31,041
No sex! You're too young.

888
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:33,750
Anything you want to discuss,
we can discuss it.

889
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:36,583
Please don't give me a heart attack
and say you've done it.

890
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:38,291
Moose, please!

891
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,291
You haven't done it yet, right?

892
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:44,916
How old were you when...

893
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:47,708
-When?
-...you and Dad did it for the first time?

894
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:56,125
<span style="style.default_1">Talking about sex is against our culture.</span>

895
01:17:56,541 --> 01:18:02,250
<span style="style.default_1">But to permit a couple to have sex,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the whole family is invited.</span>

896
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:04,916
<span style="style.default_1">The priest reads powerful mantras.</span>

897
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:07,291
<span style="style.default_1">And they play wedding music too.</span>

898
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,166
-Do you know what they're all thinking?
-What?

899
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:13,375
That we'll have sex tonight.

900
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:15,833
Imagine the performance pressure!

901
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:21,041
I'm taking full advantage
of the presidential suite

902
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,583
your colleagues gifted us.

903
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:30,791
Actually, Papa has spoken
to his brother...

904
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:34,541
you know he owns a hotel in Chandni Chowk?

905
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:36,875
We're staying there tonight.

906
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:40,791
They'll be hurt otherwise.

907
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:42,208
Please understand.

908
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:11,750
It isn't that bad.
It's big enough for us.

909
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:16,500
Anyway it's not as though
we're sleeping tonight!

910
01:19:21,625 --> 01:19:26,166
Your hair is so beautiful.

911
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:30,041
Like my hair?

912
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:34,958
Then sleep with it.

913
01:19:36,166 --> 01:19:38,833
Take this. And this.

914
01:19:38,916 --> 01:19:40,875
-Not my wedding turban!
-Enjoy!

915
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:42,750
Aditi!

916
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:46,000
Uncle!

917
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:53,208
<span style="style.default_1">Hail Moose the Tigress!</span>

918
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,916
<span style="style.default_1">Moose wanted me to experience</span>
<span style="style.default_1">everything in life...</span>

919
01:19:58,416 --> 01:20:00,291
<span style="style.default_1">before I ran out of time.</span>

920
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:03,916
<span style="style.default_1">You know like love, sex...</span>

921
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,208
<span style="style.default_1">But hearing about her wedding night,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't want a crash course from her!</span>

922
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:11,666
I'm Aisha's friend. Karan.

923
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:16,208
Karan! Hi, come.

924
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:22,708
Ishaan!

925
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:24,791
Hi, Karan.

926
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:29,833
-I think that's Karan.
-You go now, please.

927
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:37,291
Rolo.

928
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:39,791
-Hi.
-Hi. Is that Rolo?

929
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,333
-Want some?
-No, thank you.

930
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:51,833
Can I get you something?

931
01:20:53,083 --> 01:20:54,791
-Double espresso.
-Sure.

932
01:20:56,666 --> 01:20:57,500
Yeah.

933
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:16,708
<span style="style.default_1">Ishaan, now listen to your mother.</span>

934
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:18,666
Hello, Ishaan.

935
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:24,166
Get Karan to see Aisha's artwork.
An excuse to send them to her room.

936
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:32,541
<span style="style.default_1">Are you listening? Hello.</span>

937
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:33,666
Ishaan!

938
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:55,625
<span style="style.default_1">Giraffe knew Moose would drive him crazy</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if he stayed in Delhi.</span>

939
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:58,541
<span style="style.default_1">Education was just an excuse</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to escape to London.</span>

940
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:03,333
<span style="style.default_1">But I had no excuse or way out.</span>

941
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,541
<span style="style.default_1">I missed Giraffe a lot.</span>

942
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:09,750
<span style="style.default_1">He was my partner in dealing</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with Moose and Panda.</span>

943
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:12,791
Easy.

944
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:16,708
<span style="style.default_1">As soon as he left,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the house turned into a training camp.</span>

945
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,750
<span style="style.default_1">Project Aisha.</span>

946
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:27,458
<span style="style.default_1">Husband and wife got busy</span>
<span style="style.default_1">pumping my lungs.</span>

947
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:31,250
<span style="style.default_1">They meant well but... poor me!</span>

948
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:35,791
<span style="style.default_1">No matter what I wore,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the oxygen pipe was my accessory.</span>

949
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:43,083
<span style="style.default_1">Because Panda had to go to work,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he would sleep at night.</span>

950
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:44,666
<span style="style.default_1">But Moose!</span>

951
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:47,916
<span style="style.default_1">She didn't have much confidence</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in doctors.</span>

952
01:22:48,708 --> 01:22:51,000
<span style="style.default_1">Then Panda was having feelings of FOMO.</span>

953
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:56,333
<span style="style.default_1">So whenever he could,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he'd work from home.</span>

954
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:58,583
<span style="style.default_1">To be specific, in my room.</span>

955
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:05,541
<span style="style.default_1">Clearly, living in London taught them</span>
<span style="style.default_1">nothing about privacy!</span>

956
01:23:05,625 --> 01:23:10,583
<span style="style.default_1">A bit late to teach them.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Karan's visiting. Mum, Dad, out!</span>

957
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:15,416
<span style="style.default_1">They acted as if their love marriage</span>
<span style="style.default_1">had taken place ages ago.</span>

958
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:19,916
Hi, Uncle. Hey, Moose.

959
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,500
-Hi, Karan, how are you?
-I'm good.

960
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,958
Why did he use that door?
He should use the main door.

961
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:29,333
Hush. He's a friend.

962
01:23:29,416 --> 01:23:30,916
I don't like this.

963
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:35,500
-A portrait of Rolo?
-No, a self-portrait.

964
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:36,791
Ma'am, your tea.

965
01:23:37,416 --> 01:23:40,000
Santoshi, I'll have the usual.

966
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:41,708
The usual?

967
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,541
In a minute.

968
01:23:43,666 --> 01:23:45,291
Don't you understand art?

969
01:23:45,458 --> 01:23:48,416
-Meaning? Where are you?
-Take a closer look.

970
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,625
I can't see you.

971
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:56,750
Right there, on the bed.

972
01:23:57,083 --> 01:24:00,250
When I'm not around,
I'll still be here. Forever.

973
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:08,291
Don't you guys think Aisha could be
a great inspirational speaker?

974
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:15,416
<span style="style.default_1">As if I wasn't tortured enough,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the training camp acquired a new goal.</span>

975
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:18,250
Tell ma'am we're leaving in five minutes.

976
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,291
<span style="style.default_1">Thanks, Karan.</span>

977
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:22,708
-Hi, Uncle.
-Hi.

978
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:26,416
No bananas?

979
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:32,291
-I beg your pardon! Do forgive me.
-It's okay. I'll go get Aishi.

980
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:38,833
<span style="style.default_1">In any case, what did I ever do in my life</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to inspire people?</span>

981
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:41,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Aisha Chaudhary.

982
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:53,083
<span style="style.default_1">There I was in front of a thousand people.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Sure, I was nervous.</span>

983
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:56,250
<span style="style.default_1">But the audience were more nervous</span>
<span style="style.default_1">than me.</span>

984
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,833
<span style="style.default_1">They knew I knew I could die at any time.</span>

985
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:02,166
<span style="style.default_1">So whatever I said would be a hit.</span>

986
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:03,583
<span style="style.default_1">By force of habit...</span>

987
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:05,708
<span style="style.default_1">I threw them a trump card...</span>

988
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:11,875
<span style="style.default_1">Some people even cried.</span>

989
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,166
<span style="style.default_1">I was only 18...</span>

990
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:19,333
<span style="style.default_1">and my happiness hormones were exploding.</span>

991
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:21,250
<span style="style.default_1">Love, sex, deceit hormones.</span>

992
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,791
<span style="style.default_1">I was worried their Project Aisha</span>

993
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:27,625
<span style="style.default_1">would end with Karan becoming my brother.</span>

994
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:38,000
<span style="style.default_1">I hear things hot up in your 40s.</span>

995
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:41,625
<span style="style.default_1">That's if you survive till then!</span>

996
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:44,583
<span style="style.default_1">But I could hear my life ticking</span>
<span style="style.default_1">like a time bomb.</span>

997
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:47,083
<span style="style.default_1">It was now or never.</span>

998
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,708
Aisha, what's wrong?

999
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:24,916
Come here.
What's wrong, baby?

1000
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:29,750
Never mind.

1001
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:34,166
Go to sleep.

1002
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,791
<span style="style.default_1">Gradually, Project Aisha expanded.</span>

1003
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,083
<span style="style.default_1">First they pumped my lungs...</span>

1004
01:27:46,666 --> 01:27:48,916
<span style="style.default_1">then they thought I had a hole</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in my heart.</span>

1005
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,916
<span style="style.default_1">Because they never had a heartbreak.</span>

1006
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,708
<span style="style.default_1">They were soul mates since</span>
<span style="style.default_1">their school days.</span>

1007
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:58,583
<span style="style.default_1">They called Ishaan home from college,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on an emergency vacation.</span>

1008
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:09,666
What nonsense!

1009
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:12,583
She has a medical condition,
so she can't parasail.

1010
01:28:12,666 --> 01:28:15,166
We're taking responsibility,
so what's your problem?

1011
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:16,500
It's still risky, right?

1012
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:18,416
If she has a medical emergency,

1013
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:19,916
we'll be making the headlines.

1014
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,791
That's nonsense!

1015
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:25,583
Moose, it's okay. You guys go ahead.

1016
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:27,583
-Of course not.
-No way.

1017
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:30,000
We all go, or none of us do.

1018
01:28:32,166 --> 01:28:35,500
<span style="style.default_1">He was right.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't feel like dying that soon.</span>

1019
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:40,666
<span style="style.default_1">But keeping me happy became more</span>
<span style="style.default_1">important than keeping me alive.</span>

1020
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,125
<span style="style.default_1">Giraffe had umpteen breakups.</span>

1021
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:52,708
<span style="style.default_1">But he was never taken</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on an emergency vacation.</span>

1022
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:27,166
<span style="style.default_1">It wasn't easy making me happy.</span>

1023
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:31,333
<span style="style.default_1">In the air there was</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the air pressure problem.</span>

1024
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,333
<span style="style.default_1">Underwater I could only handle</span>
<span style="style.default_1">two minutes. But what's two minutes?</span>

1025
01:29:37,916 --> 01:29:41,291
<span style="style.default_1">It was pointless arguing</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in the middle of the ocean.</span>

1026
01:29:42,041 --> 01:29:46,625
<span style="style.default_1">They were trying so hard,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I thought let's get over with it. Jump in.</span>

1027
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:54,208
<span style="style.default_1">There are moments</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when you live life to the fullest.</span>

1028
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:57,083
<span style="style.default_1">And when you're in that moment...</span>

1029
01:30:57,250 --> 01:31:00,416
<span style="style.default_1">you realize that life is</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a most wondrous thing.</span>

1030
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:03,083
<span style="style.default_1">Life didn't give me those moments...</span>

1031
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:05,708
<span style="style.default_1">Moose and Panda created them.</span>

1032
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:28,083
Aishi...

1033
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:34,291
Baby, look at Mamma.

1034
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:45,958
Oh, God, please.

1035
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:54,958
Niren!

1036
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:57,291
Her oxygen levels are dropping.

1037
01:32:00,291 --> 01:32:03,416
Aishi? Is the machine working?

1038
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:06,333
The pilot must make an emergency landing.

1039
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:11,125
Ishaan, ask the stewardess to get us
their spare oxygen tank. Now!

1040
01:32:11,208 --> 01:32:12,208
You can't enter the cockpit.

1041
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:14,708
Ma'am, it's an emergency,
I must talk to the pilot.

1042
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:17,750
-What's wrong?
-My daughter can't breathe.

1043
01:32:18,541 --> 01:32:22,166
-I need oxygen for my sister.
-Sir, please don't run.

1044
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,875
Just look at Mamma.

1045
01:32:24,333 --> 01:32:25,541
Keep your eyes open.

1046
01:32:25,916 --> 01:32:27,833
Her lungs are weak.

1047
01:32:28,416 --> 01:32:30,083
She can't handle low air pressure.

1048
01:32:30,166 --> 01:32:32,000
Please lower the plane's altitude.

1049
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:33,291
Ma'am, calm down.

1050
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:37,833
What is your name?

1051
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:41,541
I know Captain Kapoor. Let me talk to him.

1052
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:45,958
<span style="style.default_1">Have you noticed where oxygen cylinders</span>
<span style="style.default_1">are kept on a flight?</span>

1053
01:32:47,208 --> 01:32:49,291
<span style="style.default_1">Moose always did her homework.</span>

1054
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,916
<span style="style.default_1">But when I had to sign</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a life risk form at the airport...</span>

1055
01:32:57,333 --> 01:32:58,500
<span style="style.default_1">Panda was shaken.</span>

1056
01:32:59,291 --> 01:33:00,916
<span style="style.default_1">He said, "Aishi, let's not go."</span>

1057
01:33:02,375 --> 01:33:05,333
<span style="style.default_1">After my heartbreak over Karan,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I was in the mood to die.</span>

1058
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:10,291
<span style="style.default_1">I insisted we travel and even signed</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the airline waiver.</span>

1059
01:33:19,166 --> 01:33:22,833
<span style="style.default_1">As a spirit I believe we remain on Earth</span>
<span style="style.default_1">until we learn certain lessons.</span>

1060
01:33:23,541 --> 01:33:25,416
<span style="style.default_1">I guess I wasn't done learning yet.</span>

1061
01:33:26,666 --> 01:33:29,666
<span style="style.default_1">There's no other reason</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't die on that flight home.</span>

1062
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:33,750
What happened?

1063
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:36,916
Don't let Aisha's smile deceive you,
her condition is worse.

1064
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:42,000
It's a natural progression of her illness.
We must go for a lung transplant now.

1065
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:46,291
We discussed this when Aisha was
first diagnosed.

1066
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:47,666
Maybe it's time.

1067
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,791
You know I'm against a transplant.

1068
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:52,250
It'll prolong her life
by ten years, Aditi.

1069
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:53,375
Start the process.

1070
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:55,833
Tell me where to sign.
And how much it'll cost.

1071
01:33:56,458 --> 01:33:58,750
-We're doing it.
-No, we're not.

1072
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:02,708
-We're doing it, Aditi.
-Over my dead body!

1073
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:05,791
-What nonsense?
-Let's discuss this somewhere else.

1074
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:12,708
Why would Nirvick suggest
a transplant needlessly?

1075
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:15,041
He's a doctor. Let him do his job.

1076
01:34:15,125 --> 01:34:16,416
Answer me then.

1077
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:20,916
A lung transplant is challenging
even for a healthy body.

1078
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,875
She's so unwell. How will she cope?

1079
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:27,333
You want her to end her days
tied to a hospital bed?

1080
01:34:28,416 --> 01:34:31,541
Will she be able to walk?
Will she be happy?

1081
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:36,208
Could you face such a life?
Or must she live for your peace of mind?

1082
01:34:36,291 --> 01:34:37,791
Do we let her die?

1083
01:34:44,666 --> 01:34:46,166
She's not only your child...

1084
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:48,666
she's mine too.

1085
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:51,250
This time your stubbornness won't work.

1086
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:53,291
-I'm being stubborn?
-Yeah...

1087
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:54,291
Stubborn!

1088
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:57,625
I've researched her medical condition
for years.

1089
01:34:58,208 --> 01:35:00,916
I badgered the doctors over every detail.

1090
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:02,750
So what if I'm being stubborn!

1091
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:04,750
Sorry. This time I'm not backing down.

1092
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:07,166
We're going for a transplant.

1093
01:35:07,416 --> 01:35:09,125
It's my final decision.

1094
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:12,333
So you'll blindly follow the doctor's
advice and not use your own brain?

1095
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:14,458
Our know-how is irrelevant here.

1096
01:35:15,166 --> 01:35:17,416
Their training and experience
is what matters.

1097
01:35:17,541 --> 01:35:19,500
What did you do when it came to Tanya?

1098
01:35:21,166 --> 01:35:23,458
You listened to the doctors.
And what happened?

1099
01:35:24,458 --> 01:35:26,583
They aren't always right.

1100
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,208
No doctor can guarantee a successful
outcome. Will you guarantee it?

1101
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:34,250
<span style="style.default_1">When I was a kid if anyone gave me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a chocolate, I'd share this secret.</span>

1102
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,916
<span style="style.default_1">"I have an elder sister, Tanya.</span>

1103
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,958
<span style="style.default_1">She lives with Mother Mary."</span>

1104
01:35:42,416 --> 01:35:46,625
<span style="style.default_1">It was a secret because Moose never talked</span>
<span style="style.default_1">about her in Panda's presence.</span>

1105
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:52,583
<span style="style.default_1">Panda wanted to forget</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that their first born was Tanya.</span>

1106
01:35:54,333 --> 01:35:58,583
<span style="style.default_1">I once asked Moose if Panda</span>
<span style="style.default_1">would forget me too.</span>

1107
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:03,166
<span style="style.default_1">Will they not have photos of me?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Like Tanya?</span>

1108
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:07,875
Niren's blood was meant to increase
Tanya's hemoglobin...

1109
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:10,458
instead it has made her worse.

1110
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,708
Tanya has SCID,
Severe Combined Immune Deficiency.

1111
01:36:15,333 --> 01:36:19,583
If only you had come earlier, I would've
suggested you take her to London.

1112
01:36:20,333 --> 01:36:23,125
But now it's too late.
Not more than 24 hours.

1113
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:26,500
I've been telling you
for the last 5 months...

1114
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:29,000
something's seriously wrong with Tanya.

1115
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:33,458
But neither you nor those ten doctors
listened to me.

1116
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,416
"Children always get fever.

1117
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,708
Have a Valium. Stop worrying."

1118
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:40,708
It's all your fault.

1119
01:36:50,958 --> 01:36:51,916
No, baby. Please.

1120
01:36:57,083 --> 01:36:58,500
Don't cry. Please.

1121
01:37:07,708 --> 01:37:09,958
Mother Mary understands your pain.

1122
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,291
Then why doesn't she save my Taanu?

1123
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,083
Because she understands her pain too.

1124
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:32,916
Don't cry.

1125
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:37,666
Mamma may be selfish...

1126
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:41,333
but not that selfish
to ignore your suffering.

1127
01:37:45,541 --> 01:37:46,750
Go, my baby.

1128
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:51,875
Next time come back healed.

1129
01:38:38,291 --> 01:38:42,708
<span style="style.default_1">So this is when Moose had her vision</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and became a Christian.</span>

1130
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,250
<span style="style.default_1">That vision was Mother Mary.</span>

1131
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:48,000
<span style="style.default_1">I love you, Panda.</span>

1132
01:38:48,583 --> 01:38:50,791
<span style="style.default_1">Where can we find husbands like him...</span>

1133
01:38:52,625 --> 01:38:55,250
<span style="style.default_1">who love their wives unconditionally?</span>

1134
01:38:57,125 --> 01:39:02,625
<span style="style.default_1">Fun fact, I owe my existence</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to my sister's death.</span>

1135
01:39:38,625 --> 01:39:40,708
Your paintings should be in an exhibition.

1136
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:43,125
What do you want?

1137
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:47,125
Honestly. They're really good.

1138
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:50,000
Panda...

1139
01:39:50,541 --> 01:39:51,958
Cut to the chase.

1140
01:39:53,916 --> 01:39:55,583
Tell me what you really want.

1141
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:04,208
Uncle Nirvick suggests you have
a lung transplant.

1142
01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:07,791
It'll prolong your life by ten years.

1143
01:40:09,166 --> 01:40:11,041
Shouldn't we take that chance?

1144
01:40:12,833 --> 01:40:18,125
Why? You think it'll be easier to die
at 28 instead of 18?

1145
01:40:20,125 --> 01:40:22,666
We'll get to spend
ten more years together, Aishi.

1146
01:40:23,666 --> 01:40:29,083
I want you for as long as possible.
This isn't enough.

1147
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:31,166
I've had enough, Panda.

1148
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:34,541
I don't want any more problems.

1149
01:40:37,625 --> 01:40:39,958
Who knows what happens now, Anshu.

1150
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:43,750
Niren's with her. I'll call you later.

1151
01:40:43,833 --> 01:40:46,125
-Where do you want to sit?
-Near Moose.

1152
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:47,583
Come, my baby.

1153
01:40:50,875 --> 01:40:53,375
Moose, sit here.
I want to paint you.

1154
01:40:53,541 --> 01:40:55,666
No, no, please. I don't like posing.

1155
01:40:56,166 --> 01:40:59,166
You'll treasure the painting after I die.

1156
01:40:59,458 --> 01:41:02,791
Nonsense! You are not going to die.

1157
01:41:02,958 --> 01:41:05,125
Obviously not this minute.
Sit down, please.

1158
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:12,916
-Moose, cover your head.
-I never cover my head.

1159
01:41:13,208 --> 01:41:15,416
Let the painter do her job. Go on.

1160
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:18,250
Okay?

1161
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:19,875
Over your shoulder.

1162
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:24,500
Okay now?

1163
01:41:27,541 --> 01:41:29,333
Stop. Statue. Don't move.

1164
01:41:37,083 --> 01:41:38,916
Don't make such a sad face.

1165
01:41:40,125 --> 01:41:43,208
I'll tell you what...
think of something nice.

1166
01:41:44,333 --> 01:41:46,166
Like when Panda kissed you the first time.

1167
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:52,500
Or when you were pregnant with me.
You were round like a football.

1168
01:42:37,166 --> 01:42:39,375
Hey, Internet Queen!

1169
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:41,333
I was just checking...

1170
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:44,583
Aish.

1171
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:48,625
Aish, what's wrong?

1172
01:42:49,416 --> 01:42:52,208
Giraffe, I don't want to die.

1173
01:42:53,666 --> 01:42:58,250
How can I leave you, Moose, Panda?

1174
01:43:04,041 --> 01:43:05,083
Okay, Aish.

1175
01:43:07,458 --> 01:43:11,416
I know this is a horrid, shitty situation.
I understand that.

1176
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,666
<span style="style.default_1">Remember you won't be alone for long.</span>

1177
01:43:15,666 --> 01:43:19,166
Mom, Dad and I will join you very soon.

1178
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:21,083
<span style="style.default_1">We'll be together again.</span>

1179
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:26,083
A new family isn't created every time.
The same family gets reincarnated.

1180
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:29,625
<span style="style.default_1">Like in this lifetime, you're my sister...</span>

1181
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:32,833
maybe in the next, you'll be my Dad.
And Mom will be your wife.

1182
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:36,750
No, wait. Let's not make Mom your wife.

1183
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:39,208
<span style="style.default_1">Let's make her Jeet, our cook.</span>

1184
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:42,041
<span style="style.default_1">Our extended family is reincarnated too.</span>

1185
01:43:42,125 --> 01:43:45,416
So she won't enter our rooms
without knocking!

1186
01:43:47,125 --> 01:43:50,458
You know what?
Next time you can be Rolo.

1187
01:43:51,541 --> 01:43:55,708
Eat, sleep, poop, bark, even bite,
if something enrages you.

1188
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:11,125
Don't forget to call.

1189
01:44:11,208 --> 01:44:12,125
Every day.

1190
01:44:34,875 --> 01:44:36,875
<span style="style.default_1">Moose got advice from Indian doctors...</span>

1191
01:44:37,166 --> 01:44:40,666
<span style="style.default_1">British, American, Australian</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and even Canadian.</span>

1192
01:44:48,666 --> 01:44:51,125
<span style="style.default_1">She worked day and night.</span>

1193
01:44:52,416 --> 01:44:55,000
<span style="style.default_1">My coughing fits helped.</span>

1194
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:59,208
<span style="style.default_1">They gave her a little break,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but not a full night's sleep.</span>

1195
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:04,166
<span style="style.default_1">This week she slept for 16 hours only.</span>

1196
01:45:04,875 --> 01:45:07,875
<span style="style.default_1">You must know what happens</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when people don't sleep.</span>

1197
01:45:08,875 --> 01:45:10,625
<span style="style.default_1">They don't absorb dopamine.</span>

1198
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:14,375
<span style="style.default_1">Their glucose processing shuts down.</span>

1199
01:45:21,083 --> 01:45:24,541
<span style="style.default_1">And finally their brain's</span>
<span style="style.default_1">neural connections short circuit.</span>

1200
01:45:25,708 --> 01:45:28,083
Aditi, what's wrong?

1201
01:45:32,083 --> 01:45:33,083
What are you doing?

1202
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:35,291
Stop it. What's going on?

1203
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:40,833
Must be a bad dream.

1204
01:45:41,708 --> 01:45:43,958
-Go back to sleep.
-I want some tea.

1205
01:45:52,083 --> 01:45:53,750
All men are bastards!

1206
01:45:53,875 --> 01:45:55,791
You'll wake Aisha. What's this drama?

1207
01:45:58,500 --> 01:45:59,625
Get off me!

1208
01:46:04,916 --> 01:46:06,291
Get off! Control yourself.

1209
01:46:21,666 --> 01:46:24,333
Come, let's go and have a cup of tea.

1210
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:26,916
-She wants to have some tea.
-Yes, sure.

1211
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:30,291
Ma'am!

1212
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:34,000
Grab her legs!

1213
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:38,375
Don't let her go.

1214
01:46:39,958 --> 01:46:40,833
She'll be fine.

1215
01:46:40,958 --> 01:46:43,458
-Take care of Aisha.
-I'm here.

1216
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,916
Jeet, open the car door.

1217
01:47:07,083 --> 01:47:10,333
-What's wrong with her?
-We'll have to take her to Vimhans.

1218
01:47:11,375 --> 01:47:14,125
-The mental hospital?
-She's having a psychotic breakdown.

1219
01:47:17,125 --> 01:47:18,166
Will she be okay?

1220
01:47:40,125 --> 01:47:43,708
Don't worry, Panda. Moose will be fine.

1221
01:47:45,583 --> 01:47:47,000
I'm not thinking about her.

1222
01:47:54,166 --> 01:47:57,541
I won't kick the bucket
until Moose comes home.

1223
01:48:01,916 --> 01:48:03,375
I can't bear to think...

1224
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:09,833
how miserable she'll make your life
when I'm gone.

1225
01:48:15,291 --> 01:48:16,458
I'll talk to Ishaan.

1226
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:19,291
Maybe she'd feel better if he came home.

1227
01:48:21,041 --> 01:48:25,708
Panda, there's only one sane person
left in this family.

1228
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:29,000
Let him be.

1229
01:49:35,125 --> 01:49:38,000
Jeet, where's Aisha?

1230
01:49:38,208 --> 01:49:39,875
Upstairs with sir.

1231
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:44,333
-Anshu, I'm going up.
-I'll just come.

1232
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:50,041
Please give me a cup of tea.

1233
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:12,458
Guys, control!
It's only been a week.

1234
01:50:15,583 --> 01:50:17,750
I've missed you.

1235
01:50:25,916 --> 01:50:27,333
You're back, my drama queen.

1236
01:50:36,333 --> 01:50:37,333
A gift for you.

1237
01:50:47,708 --> 01:50:51,458
Someone had to look after the house.
And Panda.

1238
01:50:54,333 --> 01:50:57,500
So I did.
I even finished writing my book.

1239
01:51:02,666 --> 01:51:06,041
Not everyone can
avoid responsibilities like you.

1240
01:51:09,958 --> 01:51:12,208
Niren, let's look for a publisher.

1241
01:51:12,291 --> 01:51:14,916
By the way, the publisher
really liked her book.

1242
01:51:15,708 --> 01:51:17,583
-What?
-Bloomsbury.

1243
01:51:19,625 --> 01:51:20,458
Wow!

1244
01:51:21,291 --> 01:51:23,250
I should do double drama next time...

1245
01:51:23,375 --> 01:51:25,458
so you'll write a sequel!

1246
01:53:08,041 --> 01:53:09,208
Aishi.

1247
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:19,166
Here you go. You're okay.

1248
01:53:33,291 --> 01:53:34,458
Breathe, baby.

1249
01:53:47,083 --> 01:53:48,625
Try and lie back.

1250
01:53:53,625 --> 01:53:57,333
I'll tell Santoshi to make
chocolate waffles for breakfast.

1251
01:54:29,666 --> 01:54:31,333
Niren, come home. Quick.

1252
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:34,708
Yes.

1253
01:54:39,708 --> 01:54:40,666
Ishaan, wake up.

1254
01:54:41,208 --> 01:54:44,333
Aisha's not good. Stay with her.
I have to make a few calls.

1255
01:54:47,791 --> 01:54:51,375
I know the book launch is tomorrow...

1256
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:55,166
but I must have a copy
of Aisha's book today.

1257
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,750
I know, but please understand...

1258
01:55:01,333 --> 01:55:02,791
time is precious for her.

1259
01:55:09,625 --> 01:55:10,708
Hey, Sport.

1260
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:12,708
Look...

1261
01:55:13,875 --> 01:55:15,291
You called and I came.

1262
01:55:23,041 --> 01:55:23,916
Hello, Nirvick.

1263
01:55:24,458 --> 01:55:27,583
She's using a lot of oxygen.
I've ordered four more cylinders.

1264
01:55:27,666 --> 01:55:28,958
How soon can you get here?

1265
01:55:30,083 --> 01:55:31,458
Please hurry.

1266
01:55:34,291 --> 01:55:39,250
Aishi, can you tell whether
this is Ishaan's hand or mine?

1267
01:55:41,583 --> 01:55:43,250
You've grown old, Panda.

1268
01:55:45,083 --> 01:55:47,875
You should use Moose's anti-aging cream.

1269
01:55:56,333 --> 01:55:57,166
Aishi.

1270
01:55:59,958 --> 01:56:00,875
You know...

1271
01:56:02,291 --> 01:56:05,916
I act like I'm very strong...

1272
01:56:06,458 --> 01:56:09,000
like things are cool with me.
And everything is okay.

1273
01:56:11,708 --> 01:56:12,708
But in my heart...

1274
01:56:14,666 --> 01:56:18,250
a day doesn't pass when
I am not thinking of you.

1275
01:56:24,875 --> 01:56:26,166
Giraffe loves you, Aishi.

1276
01:56:31,375 --> 01:56:32,208
What is it?

1277
01:56:32,291 --> 01:56:33,416
Careful, baby.

1278
01:56:48,666 --> 01:56:49,833
And my kissy?

1279
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:21,833
-Only two cylinders? We ordered four.
-They're in the car.

1280
01:57:21,916 --> 01:57:24,041
Go get them and clear out the empty ones.

1281
01:57:36,916 --> 01:57:38,416
Ma'am, the soup.

1282
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:51,375
Aishi!

1283
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:57,625
Come to me.

1284
01:57:58,583 --> 01:57:59,500
Look!

1285
01:58:02,958 --> 01:58:03,958
Your book.

1286
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
"Aisha Chaudhary."

1287
01:59:39,458 --> 01:59:43,041
<span style="style.default_1">I arrived with a bang</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and I leave with one too.</span>

1288
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:45,250
<span style="style.default_1">But the crowd's bigger this time.</span>

1289
01:59:45,958 --> 01:59:48,875
<span style="style.default_1">You feel so special</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when people cry for you.</span>

1290
01:59:49,166 --> 01:59:53,125
<span style="style.default_1">But did you notice Moose's wardrobe?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">She seems dressed for a birthday party.</span>

1291
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:55,625
<span style="style.default_1">That's the way it should be.</span>

1292
01:59:55,708 --> 01:59:59,416
<span style="style.default_1">Death-days are like birthdays.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They must be celebrated.</span>

1293
02:00:00,583 --> 02:00:04,458
<span style="style.default_1">Moose stole my Tree of Life necklace</span>
<span style="style.default_1">as a return gift.</span>

1294
02:00:12,833 --> 02:00:18,708
<span style="style.default_1">Fun fact, it seems parking lots in Delhi</span>
<span style="style.default_1">have higher premiums than graves.</span>

1295
02:00:19,375 --> 02:00:21,750
<span style="style.default_1">So I was buried double-decker style.</span>

1296
02:00:22,041 --> 02:00:24,791
<span style="style.default_1">Luckily atop my sister's coffin.</span>

1297
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,250
"FAREWELL NIREN"

1298
02:01:21,291 --> 02:01:25,208
What can I say? I completely forgot
I used to play in a band.

1299
02:01:25,333 --> 02:01:26,416
Having a blast.

1300
02:01:26,541 --> 02:01:30,375
-A grand farewell was a must! Right?
-Thank you.

1301
02:01:35,208 --> 02:01:36,291
Aditi's coming, right?

1302
02:01:49,375 --> 02:01:52,583
Excuse me. A whiskey soda, please.

1303
02:01:55,416 --> 02:01:56,875
Niren Chaudhary.

1304
02:01:57,500 --> 02:02:01,208
You've always had the last word
at every meeting. So why not here?

1305
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:07,166
So, before you run away to London,
you could do your apologizing now.

1306
02:02:07,791 --> 02:02:11,541
Here's your chance.
Come on up here, Mr. Chaudhary.

1307
02:02:37,875 --> 02:02:42,125
Thanks for this joyous
and amazing farewell party.

1308
02:02:44,708 --> 02:02:47,791
If I knew you'd enjoy
my farewell so much...

1309
02:02:47,875 --> 02:02:50,541
you should've given me a hint,
I'd have left ages ago.

1310
02:03:09,083 --> 02:03:13,625
The first time I went to London
was in 1996 for Aisha's treatment.

1311
02:03:14,416 --> 02:03:17,625
I had no money for the airfare.

1312
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:21,041
Someone at the office heard.

1313
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:25,708
And soon an empty lunch box
was passed around.

1314
02:03:26,875 --> 02:03:31,083
You gave me whatever you could
and bid me a warm farewell.

1315
02:03:34,125 --> 02:03:36,250
As your boss,
you were my responsibility...

1316
02:03:36,833 --> 02:03:39,708
but it's you guys who looked out for me.

1317
02:03:39,791 --> 02:03:40,958
Then don't go, Niren.

1318
02:03:43,583 --> 02:03:46,375
Aditi doesn't want us
to leave Delhi either.

1319
02:03:49,833 --> 02:03:54,416
But pain leaves you so empty.

1320
02:03:55,666 --> 02:03:56,541
It wears you down.

1321
02:03:58,375 --> 02:04:04,166
The only difference is I deal with pain
in one way, Aditi in another.

1322
02:04:09,375 --> 02:04:10,583
Our home here...

1323
02:04:12,541 --> 02:04:14,208
so filled with memories of Aisha...

1324
02:04:16,083 --> 02:04:18,666
haunts me constantly.

1325
02:04:20,750 --> 02:04:24,333
Maybe that's why I can't bear
to look at photos of my children.

1326
02:04:28,125 --> 02:04:29,458
Ever since she left us...

1327
02:04:32,458 --> 02:04:33,750
I can't enter her room.

1328
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,125
I feel scared...

1329
02:04:39,625 --> 02:04:43,166
that if I entered I'd lose her again.

1330
02:04:47,125 --> 02:04:48,666
But last night I did go in.

1331
02:04:49,791 --> 02:04:50,916
I sat down.

1332
02:04:52,375 --> 02:04:54,000
It felt as though she was there.

1333
02:04:57,625 --> 02:04:59,166
I looked at her drawing books.

1334
02:05:00,125 --> 02:05:02,833
She had this habit of hiding stories...

1335
02:05:02,916 --> 02:05:06,625
in her paintings, writings and videos.

1336
02:05:08,125 --> 02:05:13,166
After Aisha passed away, no one had
the courage to open her laptop.

1337
02:05:15,291 --> 02:05:19,125
But maybe we should have a long time ago.

1338
02:05:39,583 --> 02:05:43,666
<span style="style.default_1">This means one of you knew my password.</span>

1339
02:05:44,333 --> 02:05:46,375
<span style="style.default_1">I always suspected Moose.</span>

1340
02:05:47,250 --> 02:05:52,625
<span style="style.default_1">Actually, any spy agency in the world</span>
<span style="style.default_1">would recruit Moose.</span>

1341
02:05:54,125 --> 02:05:55,000
Moosical...

1342
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:57,833
Missing me?

1343
02:05:59,291 --> 02:06:02,125
Want to cry? Okay, cry.

1344
02:06:02,708 --> 02:06:05,583
But don't throttle Panda's neck
again in your sleep.

1345
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,958
I promised Panda...

1346
02:06:10,708 --> 02:06:15,708
until you were back from
the mental hospital, I wouldn't die.

1347
02:06:17,291 --> 02:06:21,666
The promise is slightly risky,
so I'm recording this video.

1348
02:06:22,833 --> 02:06:26,500
If I do die, then we won't
get to say goodbye.

1349
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:33,791
I've thought about death every day.

1350
02:06:35,041 --> 02:06:37,083
I've literally gobbled life up.

1351
02:06:38,375 --> 02:06:39,750
So death doesn't worry me.

1352
02:06:41,125 --> 02:06:42,875
Don't let it worry you either.

1353
02:06:44,208 --> 02:06:49,125
I've lived life to the fullest.

1354
02:06:50,458 --> 02:06:55,083
Moose, thank you for not aborting me.

1355
02:06:58,125 --> 02:07:05,125
And Panda, you spent your entire life
slaving away for us...

1356
02:07:06,416 --> 02:07:08,541
for party-crashers like us.

1357
02:07:10,875 --> 02:07:15,291
Giraffe, a part of me
will always be with you.

1358
02:07:17,041 --> 02:07:21,875
Please none of this "survivor's guilt"
or I'll whack you.

1359
02:07:23,958 --> 02:07:27,833
I'm sorry, Panda.
I couldn't go for that lung transplant.

1360
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,583
Remember my self-portrait?

1361
02:07:32,458 --> 02:07:36,291
Even when I'm not around, I'll be there.
Forever.

1362
02:07:39,333 --> 02:07:41,166
Don't worry about me.

1363
02:07:42,666 --> 02:07:44,791
I'm chilling with Tanya...

1364
02:07:45,208 --> 02:07:49,166
while you all are watching this video.

1365
02:07:50,541 --> 02:07:52,250
We're partying together...

1366
02:07:52,333 --> 02:07:53,458
in the sky.

1367
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:56,041
The Pink Sky.

1368
02:07:57,833 --> 02:07:59,541
Take care of my Rolo.

1369
02:10:14,875 --> 02:10:15,708
That's nothing.

1370
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Look over there.

1371
02:10:57,291 --> 02:11:01,541
<span style="style.default_1">Moose had said, next time she'd do</span>
<span style="style.default_1">more drama so I'd write a sequel.</span>

1372
02:11:02,458 --> 02:11:05,083
<span style="style.default_1">Take this movie to be the sequel</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of my book.</span>

1373
02:11:06,083 --> 02:11:09,333
<span style="style.default_1">So it's written, Moose.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Panda, find a publisher!</span>

1374
02:11:10,583 --> 02:11:15,208
<span style="style.default_1">Looking at them now, you'd think</span>
<span style="style.default_1">their sex life is still active.</span>

1375
02:11:16,125 --> 02:11:19,500
<span style="style.default_1">I know it's wrong to discuss</span>
<span style="style.default_1">your parents' sex life.</span>

1376
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,166
<span style="style.default_1">It is still wrong!</span>

1377
02:23:15,416 --> 02:23:17,125
<span style="style.default_1">Aishi, are you listening?</span>
