1
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,300
You're watching Ruby Towers
where a bomb has been planted...

2
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,300
on the 20th floor.
There is chaos all around!

3
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,600
Residents have been evicted
from their homes.

4
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,500
The police have surrounded
the place from all sides.

5
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
So let's question the
A.C.. of police...

6
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,300
This is no time for interviews!
lease let us do our work!

7
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,600
Who planted the bomb?
- Tell us... we're reporting for TV.

8
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,200
D'you see the hand of
a terrorist organisation?

9
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,800
There's a bomb expert defusing
the bomb... so let him do it!

10
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,700
Uncle! My kitten is up there!
lease get it for me!

11
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Has anyone claimed responsibility
for planting the bomb...?

12
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,200
You're stopping all of us, AC,
but can you stop Ajay Bakshi?

13
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,500
Look at the police security here!
How'd Ajay Bakshi...

14
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,300
Where's Ajay Bakshi?

15
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,500
How did you get here?
- l climbed up the pipe.

16
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,500
Why?
- The elevator is out of order!

17
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Hold it... don't move!

18
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,900
Yes, l am...
- The signals are okay!

19
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,400
Can you see the bomb?
- Don't forget our sponsor!

20
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,200
Ajay Bakshi of `K' TV goes places
even the birds don't!

21
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,700
Ajay Uncle!

22
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,200
Hurry up!
- Look at that.

23
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,600
A live-bomb has been
planted here!

24
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,900
The bomb that's about
to explode... is here!

25
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,400
lease step back... let people see!
... here is the bomb!

26
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,300
Look at what's going on there!
- The cops say...

27
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,300
in how much of time
will the bomb go off?

28
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,600
ln five minutes.
- lt will... 5...?

29
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,900
l was told it would explode
in 15 or 20 minutes!

30
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,400
andey must've told you that!
- You mean andey's...?

31
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,900
Never mind. Let's ask the expert
how quickly he will defuse it!

32
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,900
Your name?
- Gyaneshwar Kale.

33
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Move away from the bomb!
lt's dangerous!

34
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,100
Go on... move away!
- Hear that? lt's dangerous.

35
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,600
Ajay Bakshi risks his life to bring
you a live telecast of a live bomb!

36
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,600
Mr Kale, in my opinion, is
a very important person...

37
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,100
and remember our sponsors!

38
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:11,000
There are seven wires in this
bomb. Cutting off one...

39
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,600
can defuse the bomb. Right?
- Right!

40
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,600
There's just a wire and four minutes
between life and death!

41
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,300
So let's see which particular wire
Mr Kale will disconnect.

42
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,000
Will you cut the red wire?
- No.

43
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,900
The green one then?
- No.

44
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,300
The red, blue and green
are wrong wires!

45
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,000
The white one is with the red one
which we know is wrong!

46
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,000
And the yellow's with the blue one
which is definitely wrong.

47
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,500
How do you manage to
speak so fast?

48
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,600
Because l don't think!
l'm from TV...!

49
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,700
We've gotta think or
we will not survive!

50
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,000
How many children do you have?
- Seven.

51
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,000
Seven kids?
- No! Seven wires. Two kids!

52
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,700
Stop chatting and get to work!
Or we'll both get killed!

53
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,500
Remember? Everyone does! The red,
green and blue are wrong wires!

54
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,500
We now have a choice of silver,
white and black...

55
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,000
Gray's positive, you know.
And...

56
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,700
Are you saying yellow?
Are you sure? Absolutely?

57
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,600
Kale has averted a bomb explosion
and saved our lives!

58
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,800
Hear! Hear!
There's still a sound...

59
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,700
ls there always a noise like this
when you defuse a bomb?

60
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,900
No. lt happens only when
l target the wrong wire.

61
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,100
The wrong wire...? And what d'you
do in such deadly situations?

62
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,800
Normally, we run for our lives.
- Run? Well...

63
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,600
Come down here, Ajay!

64
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Ajay has saved the kitten!
- Do you love animals so much?

65
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,900
Dad says the world belongs
even to the animals.

66
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,600
... animals are human too!

67
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,900
Ajay Bakshi has once again proved
that he's the best!

68
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,400
My tiger-cub! My darling boy!

69
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,600
You've shaken up
a 1000-million lndians!

70
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,600
You're just...!
And you said,...

71
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,700
Kaka! There's no need to
grovel at my feet!

72
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:03,300
Hear! Hear! l want to concede
something before this cake is cut!

73
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,800
l'm addressing everyone
from the `K-TV' family!

74
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,300
l used to run the canteen at
Galaxy TV four years ago.

75
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,800
Kaka's eatery, right?
- Yup!

76
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,300
When l submitted a proposal of
a serial to the channel...

77
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:33,500
the owner of the channel,
K.C. Chinoy rebuked me!

78
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,100
He said, ``You can make great
vadas, but never a big man!''

79
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,000
But our man Kaka... gave the
same Chinoy a fitting reply!

80
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,300
And the same Kaka's TV,
`K- TV'...

81
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,200
is miles ahead of Galaxy TV
in terms of popularity!

82
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
All this because...
Kaka hired...

83
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,800
the most handsome and
talented man in lndia!

84
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,300
Finish your speech...
l'll clap later!

85
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,700
Forget those sorries, buddy!
KTV gives you a splended gift!

86
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,800
Gals... and the car!

87
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,000
Know why l gave this car to you?

88
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,300
What's going on?

89
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,300
Galaxy was up in the last 3 years
and KTV was down!

90
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,900
But now, KTV is right at
the top, and we're down!

91
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,800
The reputation and popularity
of our company is plummetting!

92
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,600
Think of some ideas... please!

93
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
l have a fantastic idea, sir!

94
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,900
What is it?

95
00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Why don't we beam pornographic
stuff late in the night?

96
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,500
The family viewership
will desert us!

97
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,600
My own family wouldn't mind!

98
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,200
We need a face like the one
KTV has... Ajay Bakshi!

99
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,100
A face that will storm
every household!

100
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,800
This is Rhea Banerjee bringing
you live reports...

101
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,500
of a flood, 26 kilometers away
from atna in village Chappla.

102
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,300
You can see how difficult
it is to even reach here.

103
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,300
Mister... can you tell us
where you're going?

104
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,700
Far away. My house is sunk!
Ask the government to help us!

105
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,300
As you see, people are moving out
in large numbers to safer places.

106
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,700
Trees are being uprooted...
large trees!

107
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,500
But Rhea Banerjee will continue
to bring you live reports!

108
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,200
Keep watching TV24!

109
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,900
l almost died when l lost
those real tapes.

110
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,900
But you have saved my job!
You were fantastic!

111
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,700
This is the last time l'm doing it.
l've received a call from Galaxy TV.

112
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,900
Will you quit our channel then?

113
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,500
lf you think l'll quit
your channel for...

114
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
better profile and money...

115
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,200
you're bloody well right!

116
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,700
A star like you belongs only
in the Galaxy channel.

117
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,700
...what's the deal?

118
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,500
A challenge to defeat Ajay Bakshi!
- ls there anything else?

119
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,700
Here's the contract.
Go through it carefully.

120
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,100
Don't you think this figure
has one `zero' less?

121
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,400
Fill in any figure... but
we must finish Ajay Bakshi!

122
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,400
So we have in lndia at 8 p.m. lndia
and 10.30 in Dubai everyday...

123
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,400
What d'you say? Class, isn't it?
The new model of Hyundai!

124
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,100
Which friend's car have
you borrowed today?

125
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,400
lt's my car, dad.
- Yours?

126
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,400
Aren't you happy to
see my car, dad?

127
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,300
What's the problem? Why do
you keep worrying about me?

128
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,500
Any father would worry about
his son only in two conditions.

129
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,100
One, when his son doesn't earn a
penny... or when he earns too much!

130
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,800
My boss has gifted me this car
for my good work, dad.

131
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,700
The kitten-rescue act, eh?

132
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,100
ln your days, it was news
when a dog bit a man.

133
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,500
Later, it was news
when a man bit a dog.

134
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,300
And now, when man and dog together
bite an ass, it's really news!

135
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,500
And if that's not the case...
we make sure it is!

136
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,800
We only tell people what
they want to listen to, dad.

137
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,300
For all your hardwork and labour...
what have you got, dad?

138
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,800
l've got you... and l don't
want to lose you.

139
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,700
You have the media on your side...
- And l can change the world, right?

140
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,800
Forget it. Come... let me take you
for a ''walk'' in my car.

141
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,700
Take your mom instead.
Go ahead, Shanti.

142
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
Forget it, mom...
l know he won't come.

143
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,700
Don't spoil your mood, okay?
l love your car. lt's great!

144
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,200
We won't be late for the Chief
Minister's conference, will we?

145
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:18,400
No, we won't! What a car!
Great seats, aren'it they?

146
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,900
The Galaxy guys are sending a
super reporter to outsmart you?

147
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,700
What's wrong?
- My dad!

148
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,400
What'd he lose to sit in my car?
But he'll never understand!

149
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:43,700
Never be close to these old-timers!
... hang out! Out and wide!

150
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,600
Think of this new reporter, Ajay.

151
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,200
Your new poster...
is it nice?

152
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,300
Where's the new reporter from Galaxy?
- Right there!

153
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
Beautiful!

154
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,600
So you must meet her?
- Obviously!

155
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,600
Ajay Bakshi's coming!
- l know.

156
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,700
He's so handsome!
- Only on TV.

157
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,700
l've heard the name.
- But what's in a name?

158
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
lt's people's love and affection!

159
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,300
l mentioned your channel...
not you.

160
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
lt's the coffee... not you.

161
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,000
l want a frontal mid-shot.

162
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,500
Heard that, Shahid?
- Will be done!

163
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
You haven't answered
my question, sir...

164
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,900
You must've read my party's manifesto
for the forthcoming elections.

165
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,000
l had to fight with the rime
Minister this morning to...

166
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,200
get 8000 million granted
for our state.

167
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,700
l had promised to do it!

168
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Some disgruntled members are said
to want to quit your party, sir?

169
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:34,100
Why cast an evil eye on a happy
family? They're just rumours...

170
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,500
Mr Sharma is in police custody.
Weapons were found in his house.

171
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,900
You're still giving him
an election ticket?

172
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,100
Mr Sharma is innocent!
The opposition has implicated him!

173
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,400
The matter's before the court...

174
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,300
and l have all faith in our
nation's consitution.

175
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,800
What happens to the criminal
charges framed against Mr Sharma?

176
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,100
Why were investigating officers
shunted out, sir?

177
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,300
Must you ask the questions
in a single day?

178
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,100
Glory to lndia.

179
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,600
Sharma's affair is raising questions.
Go to Central Jail at 5.30 tomorrow.

180
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,100
Do an interview with him and
give him some image-building.

181
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,100
He'll sink in the elections
and we'll sink with him!

182
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,300
Don't worry, sir...
l'll handle it.

183
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,800
Show me this watch...
this silver one.

184
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,100
What're you doing here?
- Am here to bid a proper good-bye.

185
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,700
The C.M. insisted that l interview
Sharma at 5.30 tomorrow.

186
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,500
Really?
- The world's chasing me...

187
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
and l chase you!

188
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,500
Show me that watch.
- lt wouldn't suit you...

189
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,700
lt's said to have the
fragrance of the rose too.

190
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,500
lt's nice... but l have
many of them.

191
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,700
So you must have a lot of time?
How about a cup of tea?

192
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
No.

193
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,500
l'll begin at the beginning...
What did you say your name is?

194
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,500
l didn't tell you my name.
- You gave me your mobile number...

195
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,400
l didn't give you any number.
- Good! Give me your address!

196
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,900
l'll keep dropping in, you know...
- You're getting too personal.

197
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,500
Skip the personal details...
give me some general information.

198
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,700
Are you a vegetarian or
a non-vegetarian?

199
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
What size footwear do you wear?
Or tell me your blood-group.

200
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,700
Mine's B-positive...

201
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,600
Tell me your dog's name!
Or your bank account number...

202
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:26,600
which shampoo do you use?!
Which is your favourite toothpaste?

203
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Wasn't Ajay Bakshi here?
- He was, but...

204
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
He has left.

205
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,000
- What has he done?
- You don't know what he did to me.

206
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,500
He says he loves me and
goes around with Anu!

207
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,300
l didn't know that.
- This is nothing.

208
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,300
He has a diary in which he has
telephone numbers of all the girls.

209
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,200
He decides the girl he will meet
according to the day of the week!

210
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,700
That's okay... it happens.

211
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,700
lf you happen to meet him,
you must tell him that...

212
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
l will tell him!

213
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Don't let her mislead you.
She's crazy.

214
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,200
That's the effect
l have on girls.

215
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,600
One of the girls got married
to the TV she saw me on!

216
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,800
So how am l to blame?
l was working...

217
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,900
Once a man is smitten,
Rhea... Banerjee...

218
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,200
That's your name!
- 6044132 is my telephone number.

219
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,200
Your number! Let me write it
down in the diary!

220
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,900
How about some tea?
- Let me write, please...

221
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Tea?!

222
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,600
l knew you were as
sensible as l am!

223
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,300
How about 5.30 tomorrow?
- Anytime! For you, l'm always free!

224
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,600
Don't you have an interview
with Mr Sharma tomorrow?

225
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,100
Mr Sharma is going nowhere...
he's locked up in prison, you see!

226
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,300
At 5.30 tomorrow then.
- At the Garden View Restaurant.

227
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,400
Since you're coming tomorrow...
make sure you dress in pink.

228
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,100
ln pink... you'd look
terribly sweet!

229
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,600
Sure... l'll wear pink.

230
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,100
Leave all that... and look at his.
Good looking feller, isn't he?

231
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,600
You look great as a couple in snaps!
You'd be better in real life!

232
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,800
Stop this business of
match-making, mom.

233
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,700
Let me work in peace!
- Work all day!

234
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,000
Will you keep interviewing these
cops and politicians all your life?

235
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
The only mission in your life
is to get me married, mom.

236
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,300
But l have much more to do!
So go away, mom.

237
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,800
Take one look at him, my dear!
- No.

238
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,800
lf there is someone you
love or like, tell me...

239
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,200
l'll approve immediately!
- There's no such thing happening

240
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,100
Let me note down these numbers!

241
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,700
Boy's telephone numbers?
- No. `Girls'.

242
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,000
Someone's going to
face the music tomorrow.

243
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,700
This is Rhea, Shalini.
l'm Ajay Bakshi's secretary.

244
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,200
Ajay Bakshi's secretary...?
- lease don't hang up!

245
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,900
He's embarrassed and wants to
meet you to apologise.

246
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,700
Meet me, eh?
When? And where?

247
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,400
The Garden View Restaurant
at 5.30 tomorrow.

248
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,700
You will come, won't you?
- Certainly. l'll be there!

249
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,400
Ajay has a small request...
lease come in a pink dress.

250
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,300
lt's my first date with her.
l don't want any hassles, okay?

251
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,400
Cake and champagne?
- Both ready, sir.

252
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
You'll cool down, sir!

253
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,900
Here's a pink handkerchief,
George.

254
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:19,000
When the most beautiful girl
steps in, dressed in pink....

255
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,000
just wave this handkerchief!
- l'll keep waving!

256
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
Your money, sir...

257
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,600
For me?!
Just watch my service, sir!

258
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,500
Kaka? l know it's 5.15.

259
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,300
l'll go to Central Jail and
even interview Mr Sharma.

260
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,800
Don't worry... everything
will be done soon!

261
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,100
l'll call you later, Kaka...
The jail's here!

262
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
What're you doing down here?
- Looking for my lighter!

263
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,800
Where is the lighter?
- And where's the cigarette?

264
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,500
lt's you who has
surprised me!

265
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,900
You won't wait, l know.
You must be in a hurry?

266
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,400
Of course l'll wait.
l'll leave only with you.

267
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,900
Sit down.
- You sit down too.

268
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,400
This isn't the one...
- lt's the same cake, sir!

269
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,300
l mean, she isn't...
- lt's the cake you chose, sir!

270
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,200
Leave it! The cake is excellent!
Go on, l've got to talk to her...

271
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
No, sir. The champage follows.

272
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,300
l didn't order the champagne, did l?
- You did, sir. For her.

273
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Sure, l did!
- May l leave?

274
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,100
May l play it?
- Sure,...

275
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,300
play it guys together!

276
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,400
Yes, l'm already there.
... sit down, please.

277
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,100
l've already spoken to
the Home Minister.

278
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,900
All right. l will have
lunch with him.

279
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,900
How's this angle, Mini?

280
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,100
Come here, Constable...
and don't move.

281
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,400
What're you doing in the frame?
Move away!

282
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,900
You're in the Central jail!
And you will see Mr Sharma...

283
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,000
What's going on, ma'am?
Who are you?

284
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,600
We're at work, Constable!
Go to your place!

285
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,600
l'm no constable, ma'am...
l'm the jailor of this prison!

286
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,600
He's the jailor... Y.A. Jha!

287
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,000
We're going to meet Mr Sharma.
- Do you have the permission?

288
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,000
Didn't the CM's office call you?
- No.

289
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,300
So all right...!
- Listen, lady!

290
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,500
You'd surely have an identity
card on you, right?

291
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,000
You ask me for an
identity card, do you?

292
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,800
Don't you know who l am?
- No.

293
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,300
Who exposed the ex-Commissioner?
- Who did?

294
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,500
l did. Who had AC Shukla suspended?
- Who was it?

295
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,500
lt was me! Who had the ex-jailor
of this prison suspended?!

296
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,900
You?
- l did!

297
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,300
One moment... he died of a
heart attack. He wasn't suspended!

298
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,400
And why did he have a heart attack?
- lt was because of her!

299
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,000
But...
- They won't listen, Mini!

300
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,500
Call the Chief Minister...
l hope you remember the number?

301
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,900
This is the CM's .A., Rawat.

302
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,400
Call from the Chief
Minister's office, sir!

303
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,900
The CM has sent two TV journalists
to your prison.

304
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,500
They're here, sir.
- They're friends. Treat them well.

305
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,200
l'll handle it, sir!
- Let me talk to them!

306
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,400
Let me talk... you didn't
let me talk to them!

307
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:50,000
l'm convinced, ma'am.
l'll see that you meet Mr Sharma.

308
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,200
Bhinde, take them to
Mr Sharma's cell.

309
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,400
The one inside, or outside?
- Go with him, madam.

310
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,600
You've had six glasses of water
already! How much more?

311
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:16,700
l'll have as much as l please!
lt's my life and money!

312
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,100
l'll have it from the jug...
- Don't spoil your mood. lease!

313
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,100
Here!
- What's here?

314
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,100
Obviously! What else will you
do after so much of water?

315
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,100
Am l late?

316
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
You mean the whole plot
was hatched by Dua?

317
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Absolutely!
l'm a very truthful man.

318
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,600
lt's like this. A cat littered
six kittens in my backyard.

319
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,500
They will even blame the birth
of the kittens on me!

320
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,600
Just because they were
born under my roof!

321
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,300
l'm being subjected to a test
by fire. Like Goddess Sita.

322
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,000
l've been fasting like Gandhi
in these dark cells!

323
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,500
Thanks for sparing us your
precious time, Mr Sharma.

324
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,500
Manage with the footage you got
in the last interview, okay?

325
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,500
You ask nice questions...
what's your name?

326
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,200
Wonderful! And l'm waiting
for my freedom!

327
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,500
When did you join Ajay?
- lt was very recently.

328
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
You're going into the
inside cell, are you?

329
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,700
lease join me...
Come along.

330
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,700
Leave the camera here.
lt's a dangerous toy.

331
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,500
Guys having fun, l see!

332
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,200
Carry on! They work with Ajay;
girls from our own party.

333
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,600
What was the name...?
Oh yes, Rhea!

334
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,700
What will you have?
Beer? Whisky?

335
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,200
Thanks. l don't drink.
- As you wish.

336
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,200
You have the works here, Mr Sharma!
A fridge and a television set...!

337
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,700
lt's all because of the affection
of our party workers!

338
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,400
l can tolerate heat
and poverty, you know.

339
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,900
l have a fridge so l can
have some chilled beer!

340
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:21,900
Ajay Bakshi's a smart guy, okay!
Always surrounded by beautiful girls!

341
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,800
No... listen to me! lease!

342
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,600
Rhea! What have you done to me?!

343
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,800
To hell with your TV!
- Who's the insolent man?

344
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,200
ldiot! This is the CM!
- You, sir? Sorry, sir!

345
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,800
Ajay Bakshi was supposed to
interview Sharma in prison.

346
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,100
But the girl from Galaxy TV
got there first...

347
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,600
and she has ruined Sharma!

348
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,700
Know how this will affect
the elections?

349
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,700
l'll have your channel thrown
out from every home! Okay?!

350
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,000
l'll do something, sir...
right now! But...

351
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,700
Where's Ajay?!
Call him here!

352
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,900
You scoundrel! Swine!

353
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,200
You bloody idiot!
Wastrel and a bloody fool!

354
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,200
You're abusing me!
- No! l'm abusing myself!

355
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,900
l'm an ass!

356
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,700
l'm actually a horse...

357
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,900
that goes lame on the
day of the races!

358
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,200
You asked me to interview Sharma.
But did l go there?

359
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,200
No!
- Why didn't you remind me?

360
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,200
l reminded you so many times!
- But l didn't go there!

361
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,200
And why not? Because l'm a
cheap shirker!

362
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,600
How could you employ a man like me?

363
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,600
lt's your indulgence
that has spoilt me!

364
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:39,200
When have l indulged you, son?
- Son! There you are!

365
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,300
Know what l think of myself?
l could spit on myself!

366
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
l'm crying!

367
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,900
l can't see the tears!
- l'm crying... at heart!

368
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,300
l'm going away...
- But listen, son...

369
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,800
l know he won't listen to me!
So suspend me, Mary.

370
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,300
l?
- Go ahead!

371
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,600
l'm still a temporary employee, sir.
- Temporary?

372
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,600
ls she really temporary?
- Yes, she is.

373
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,900
Give her permanency!
- She arrived just 3 months ago.

374
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Give her permanency, l say!

375
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Now write,...

376
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,500
l'll do it in a minute, sir!

377
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:39,100
l've got you your permanency, Mary.
And you will suspend me!

378
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,100
Are you trying to drive a
wedge between us, Mary?!

379
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,100
Forget this idea of quitting
the channel, my boy.

380
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,600
This is my first and last warning!
Such a thing must not happen again!

381
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,300
No, it won't...!
But what have l done?!

382
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:10,700
Meet Mr Ramakant Dua,
a big politician and my friend.

383
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,300
This is his brother-in-law, the
Gandhian industrialist, Mr Gupta.

384
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,200
You had only to infiltrate
the prison for Sharma...

385
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,000
and it has set the cat among
the pigeons! Hats off to you!

386
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,200
You're a smart girl... you can surely
be a member of the Upper House.

387
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,900
Sit down.
- Elections are upon us, Chinoy.

388
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,700
Have you given a thought
to my publicity?

389
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,500
Don't worry. You will be the
chief minister this time around!

390
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,400
Thank you, Mr Chinoy...
lease do something, Rhea.

391
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,600
Give Mr Dua a new image and
make him a house-hold name.

392
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:54,000
For that, you'll have to walk
the streets and into people's homes.

393
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,200
What does that mean?
- A journey on foot.

394
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,700
Let's organise a rally
and telecast it live.

395
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,200
We'll call it Ramakant Dua's
march for welfare.

396
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,700
What will you have?
Beer? Whiskey?

397
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:16,700
She has made it, Ajay! They're
showing that interview repeatedly!

398
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,300
We used to be best...
now she is!

399
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,200
She ought to be!

400
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,200
Any girl who outsmarts Ajay Bakshi
has to be bloody something!

401
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:30,700
That girl has ruined your reputation.
You almost lost yourjob...

402
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,400
and you've forgiven her!
- No way.

403
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,900
This is the first time
l've really liked a girl.

404
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:43,100
But l will ruin her rally!
- How?

405
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,400
Underworld bosses are meeting
at the cemetry this afternoon.

406
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,100
We will find someone there
who will screw up her rally.

407
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,800
Why did you call a meeting
in the graveyard?

408
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:15,100
What we will discuss at
this meeting is that...

409
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,800
people ought to be scared
of dons like us.

410
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
But this sample... appu Jr.
isn't still in his chair!

411
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,800
Our comrade, appu Sr. took
15 bullets before he died!

412
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:38,100
l told him often not to do it...
this is where he is buried.

413
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,200
He died and left behind his
good-for-nothing son, appu Jr!

414
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,200
Hi, Abbu! Hi Babu!

415
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,800
How're the kids doing?

416
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,200
Sit down... we're all equal.

417
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,800
Don't you sit down!
Remain standing!

418
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,500
Your father was a good don!

419
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,200
He was a blot on the society.
But you're a blot on us!

420
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:25,700
l'd asked you to rob a bank.
What did you do of that?

421
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,500
l really raided the place, uncle.

422
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,000
l got in there with my gun!

423
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,200
And l stormed into
the manager's cabin.

424
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,100
But he rose to greet me!

425
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,100
And l realised l had an account
in that very bank!

426
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,200
Would anyone rob his own account?

427
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,500
He's right.
This business is unpredictable.

428
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,300
Couldn't you find another bank?!
- l did...

429
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,400
but it was a Sunday, a holiday!

430
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:10,200
Couldn't you make it on a Monday?
- l did. But it was a holiday too!

431
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,900
How can any decent man
be a don...

432
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,900
in a country which has
so many holidays?

433
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,600
He's right.
Business isn't fun anymore.

434
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,800
To hell with your bank!

435
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,900
l sent you out to instigate
riots... what happened?

436
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,900
l went there. But l saw women
in the marketplace...

437
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:34,100
and lovely little children playing
around. What could l do?

438
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,900
So you just came back?
- No, sir!

439
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,600
l played cricket with them
and scored an unbeaten 29!

440
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,700
Bloody idiot! Why didn't
you start those riots?!

441
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,900
We not politicians to
start riots, uncle.

442
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,300
We mustn't do it
without any provocation.

443
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,800
We are gangsters, uncle...
we have some self-respect.

444
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,800
Which means you've done nothing
daring in the last six months!

445
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,900
Let go, uncle...

446
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,800
l've made an album, uncle.
- A bomb?

447
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,300
An album... it's art.
- What's that?

448
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,600
''Dons... we had to be''

449
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,600
He's gone mad!
Just throw him out!

450
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,600
We've been humiliated!
Nobody has seen us, l hope!

451
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,700
What difference does that make?
- Right...

452
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,600
We do recognise you!

453
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,300
We badly need publicity, mister.
- Hang on...

454
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,500
the public's gonna cheer you
when l'm through!

455
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
How's that?
- Do you know Ramakant Dua?

456
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,700
Rammu, you mean?
l know the bloody double-crosser!

457
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,400
You can take your fame in
the underworld for granted!

458
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,400
Long live, Ramakant Dua!

459
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:14,900
This is Rhea Banerjee at Mr
Ramakant Dua's welfare rally.

460
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,700
This is where you will
get the publicity.

461
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,500
Recognise me? My childhood
chum... this is appu Jr!

462
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,200
l want to say a few words
about my friend!

463
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,900
l have a right, don't l?
- Sure.

464
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:42,900
He's a crook! Don't let him speak!
- How can l stop him in the crowd?

465
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,700
Mr Ramakant Dua is a
follower of non-violence.

466
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,100
He has always trodden the
path shown by Mahatma Gandhi.

467
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,400
But he's praising me.

468
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,900
Know why?
- Why?

469
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,100
He lives on Mahatma Gandhi Street!

470
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,400
This man is a liar,
ladies and gentleman!

471
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,400
You know what Bhavna (feelings)
l have for the poor!

472
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,900
Bhavna! That's his maid-servant
whom he has impregnated!

473
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,800
His two illegitimate sons
are here too!

474
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,000
Dad!

475
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,600
Stop it! Call the police!

476
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,300
The attack on Mr Gupta raises serious
questions of security in the city.

477
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,800
The police have been unable to
say anything about the assassin.

478
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:49,600
All l can say is that Mr Gupta's
condition is stable...

479
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,500
all efforts are being
made to save him.

480
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,000
Who opened fire?
- We'll let you know soon.

481
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,500
Couldn't tell who opened fire,
could we?

482
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,700
l'm glad Mr Gupta has survived...
- l don't want to talk to you!

483
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,200
Not after what you did today!
Aren't you ashamed to bring thugs...

484
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,900
l was ashamed, all right.

485
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:27,400
You must also have been, to send
all those girls to the restaurant.

486
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:36,700
May l drop you home?
- What for?

487
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:42,600
Dad says no girl must
go out alone after 9.30.

488
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,600
Especially when she's
returning from a hospital.

489
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:50,700
So you have the decency...
- Not me. My father does.

490
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:55,100
May l leave you home?
- ...l stay close by.

491
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,100
So l'll leave you close-by.

492
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,400
Let me open it...
- l'm doing it anyway.

493
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,400
You can't manage it...
l'll open it for you. lease.

494
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,800
All right. Do it.

495
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:26,100
This is how you do it.
Hold this and press gently...

496
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:43,500
Don't worry... it's not
going to rain tonight.

497
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,500
Shall we go?

498
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
What happened? Let's go.

499
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:13,500
l think you must wear this blazer.
- Thanks, l don't need it.

500
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,300
l'm not so delicate anyway.
- But you sure are transparent.

501
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,800
You ought to carry an
umbrella in the monsoons.

502
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,700
What's that in your pocket?

503
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,400
l've been looking
for it for 2 days!

504
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:40,200
l always have half a banana
and save the other half.

505
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,500
You never know when
you might need it.

506
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:46,700
You're eating a 2-day old banana!
- lt's older, actually.

507
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,200
Want a bite?
- Never!

508
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,900
May l ask you something personal?
- Go ahead.

509
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:02,700
Are you human or an ape?
- What do you like?

510
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,900
Where've you been, riya!
l was so worried! lt was raining,...

511
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:22,700
Mom and... Meet Mr Ajay Bakshi.
He came to drop me home.

512
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,900
Come in!

513
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,900
Aren't you the same guy who...?!

514
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:33,200
Oh yes! You didn't tell me
about him, Rhea!

515
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:38,900
And l've told her l'd approve
of any boy she chooses!

516
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,400
And she went and chose you!
What luck!

517
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,400
Sit down...
- You have a lovely house.

518
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,400
Wait... you're drenched, you see.

519
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:53,400
There's a misunderstanding, Mom.
He's only a...

520
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:59,900
Let Mom's emotions flow, Rhea!
She says such nice things!

521
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,400
And Bengali! lt's a sweet language.
- He knows our language!

522
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,600
He has a nice smile...
and this is a cute ear-ring.

523
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,800
What're you upto, Rhea?

524
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,600
You have a secure job, l hope?
- lndeed!

525
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,400
l even have a provident fund!
- So you can marry immediately!

526
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,800
Great! l'm free tomorrow...
how about you?

527
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,600
This is the limit!
l won't marry this man, will l?

528
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,800
Why not?!

529
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,600
Here's your coat.
And now go home!

530
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,200
l was kidding, you see.
l only came to drop her home...

531
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,100
and l'm just a friend.
- Really?

532
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,600
l'm famished, but she didn't ask me
if l'd like something to eat!

533
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,700
Would you like something?
... here you are.

534
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,500
Bananas! l follow this principle
with bananas. l have half of it...

535
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,200
and he saves the other half!
... Go on now.

536
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:11,000
l like this boy, Rhea.
Give it a thought!

537
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:19,200
Don't cry, sister!
Stop it now.

538
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:25,700
olitics has claimed
my sister's husband.

539
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,700
Stop crying...
someone take care of her.

540
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:48,400
lt's a God-given opportunity
with elections round the corner.

541
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,900
What better chance can we have
of garnering sympathy?

542
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,300
My brother-in-law, Magan Gupta,
is dead.

543
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,300
What?
- Tell the boys what to do.

544
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,000
Be careful.

545
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,400
C'mon, guys. Get ready.

546
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:20,000
lt'll cause riots in the city...
people will die.

547
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,300
So let them die.
l stand to benefit.

548
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,600
The most important aspect
of politics is timing.

549
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,100
Now's the time we can
reap the benefits.

550
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,700
Greetings to all of you!

551
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,700
lease calm down!

552
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,000
You have seen what the Chief
Minister has done to me!

553
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,300
He's doomed...
so he's gone crazy!

554
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,300
He had an assassination
attempt made on me!

555
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,000
But none can kill a man
protected by God!

556
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,300
The bullet grazed my arm...

557
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,500
and hit my brother-in-law!

558
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:09,300
He is dead. And my sister
has been widowed!

559
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:18,200
We'l1 give them a fitting reply!
But it won't be violent...

560
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,500
Certainly not with fisticuffs!

561
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:27,000
Down with the Chief Minister!

562
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:38,700
Who will stop them or
make them see reason?

563
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:34,800
l will perform a prayer
for peace in the city.

564
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,100
oliticians are
fighting for power...

565
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,400
but Mr Ramakant Dua
is praying for peace.

566
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,600
eace for the world.

567
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:51,800
Do something! Dua is getting
all the public sympathy!

568
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:56,800
Give the riots a communal colour
and blame it on Dua.

569
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:25,200
What's happening to this
city, Ajay? lt's on fire!

570
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,100
There's so much of bloodshed.
- Listen...

571
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,900
What're you doing, Shahid?
- Shooting.

572
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:44,100
Shooting what?
What are you upto!

573
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,900
laying football, l guess.

574
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,500
l know you're at work!
But what frame are you capturing?

575
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,900
Come to me... it's okay...
don't be scared.

576
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,400
Who is this man who has plunged
the city into these riots?

577
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,600
The police have arrested the man
who has started a war...

578
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,900
between two political parties.
But they know little about him.

579
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:39,200
We will keep you briefed
on the latest developments.

580
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,600
This is the Chief Minister
here, Commissioner.

581
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,400
Tell the press that Ramakant Dua
hired an assassin to fire at him...

582
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,400
so he could get
public sympathy.

583
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,500
How can l say that, sir?
- lt's a lie, all right.

584
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,600
lssue it officially and
it'll become the truth.

585
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,600
Do as l say, or you will be
posted at Lal Ganj!

586
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,300
Ramakant Dua here.

587
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
l'm very tense, sir...
- l'll rid you of the tension.

588
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,700
Make an announcement that the man
arrested, belongs to the CM's party.

589
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,300
lnvestigations are underway, sir...
- Remember this much, Commissioner.

590
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,700
l may be the Chief Minister soon.

591
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:33,800
They ask me to pin the
blame on each other!

592
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,800
But how about me?
Am l not human?

593
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,800
Each one of them makes me
dance like a puppet!

594
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,100
The press is waiting outside.
They need to be told something.

595
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,700
What will l tell the press?
l don't know!

596
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:52,500
Let's use the ''foreign hand'', sir.
lt'll keep them busy for a month.

597
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,200
The foreign hand! Correct!

598
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:04,900
Who's this man, sir?
Does he belong to a political party?

599
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,200
l'm here to answer your questions!

600
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:12,500
That man does not belong to any
political party or organisation.

601
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,000
He's a terrorist from
a foreign country.

602
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,400
He's a terrorist who has been sent
to destablise our country!

603
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,700
lf only this terrorist
was part of our gang!

604
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:37,400
Here's our chance for publicity.
Let's have this terrorist!

605
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,700
Kidnap him?
- Yes!

606
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,900
...with live coverage
on the Magan Gupta killing.

607
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,100
We'll show you a glimpse of this
dreaded terrorist any time now...

608
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,600
He is being taken to
a high-security prison.

609
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,300
Which terrorist group
do you belong to?

610
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,500
Switch it off. Go on!

611
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Where's he? He has disappeared!

612
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,100
A sensational twist to
the Maganlal killing!

613
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:55,800
lnternational terrorist escapes
despite tight police security.

614
01:17:56,100 --> 01:18:01,800
lt raises doubts over
lndian intelligence agencies.

615
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:12,300
l couldn't figure out anything.
The lights went off...

616
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,000
for a minute, and he disappeared.

617
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,700
Did you see his eyes?
Weren't they so scary?

618
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,800
- But l wasn't afraid.
- Do you think they'll catch him?

619
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,800
lt's a big racket of fake
passports and fake visas.

620
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,300
He'll be some place away by the
time the police swing into action.

621
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:33,200
l want the reports on all blockades!

622
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,700
Stop your car!
- How're you doing, AC?

623
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,400
Ajay Bakshi and Rhea
Banerjee together!

624
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,700
Let them through...
they're from the press!

625
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:51,200
According to information received
by lndia's Most Wanted...

626
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,900
a dreaded terrorist,
Mohan Joshi,...

627
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,200
has befooled the law and escaped!

628
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,000
A red alert for all our viewers!

629
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,100
Look at his face...
he looks dangerous.

630
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,600
This man is dangerous and armed.

631
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:14,100
Do not attempt to catch him
if he is seen anywhere...

632
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:17,900
you could be risking your life.

633
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,900
l've shaken up the Government!
l have the terrorist in a drum!

634
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,900
Where's Sapre?
- He got left behind.

635
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,900
Naturally. He does not
move with the times!

636
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:37,600
Open it!

637
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:44,900
What were you doing in there?
- You locked me in my mistake!

638
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,300
How about him?
- The terrorist left...

639
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,400
in the journalist's car.
- So why didn't you tell me?!

640
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:54,400
Strange! How can anyone
speak up before you!

641
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,800
You have shattered my dreams!
l want that terrorist!

642
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,800
l want him... where is he?!

643
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Let me... warn you!
Don't think we're scared!

644
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,000
He seems to be a madman, Ajay.
He doesn't understand a word!

645
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,700
This is a warning, okay?

646
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,800
l'm hungry.
- Hungry?!

647
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,200
Can you give me something to eat?

648
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,700
Do you have something?
Check out your bag!

649
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,200
Switch on the camera!

650
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:13,700
l have half a banana...

651
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:25,400
l must warn you that the
police are looking for you.

652
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,900
lt has been made clear on
every television channel...

653
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,400
that you are an extremist.
you're a terrorist...

654
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:37,400
l am not a terrorist!
l'm not!

655
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:49,900
l had a daughterjust like you.
Her name was Kavita.

656
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,100
Father...

657
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:57,100
What's wrong?
- She's getting nervous.

658
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,100
Actually, Mom is making
me nervous, father.

659
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,000
Step aside... go on.
Don't scare her.

660
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:09,100
l've served them for 30 years, dear.
l know Maganbhai's father very well.

661
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,600
He says yourjob is confirmed,
so it's confirmed.

662
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,200
Don't be scared.

663
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,900
Our daughter has an interview!
We must sweeten her tongue.

664
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,200
Do we have any sweets at home?
- No.

665
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,600
No? ln that case,
here's what we will do...

666
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:31,100
let's make a laddoo out
of this rose, okay?

667
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,400
The rose has disappeared!
And where's the laddoo?

668
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Here it is!
- But that's a peda, father!

669
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,300
Really? Taste it, dear.

670
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:51,600
ls it really a peda?
- Yes, and where's the laddoo?

671
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:56,600
So where is the laddoo?
...here it is!

672
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Bangles?!

673
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:22,000
My daughter, Kavita Joshi. The boss
has called her for an interview.

674
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,800
l'm Kavita Joshi...
Mohan Joshi's daughter.

675
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,500
l have some certificates...

676
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,200
No...! Father!

677
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,000
Why's it barking?

678
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,000
No... please don't!

679
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,800
... father!
lease let me go!

680
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,700
ls the interview over?
- She left half an hour ago.

681
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,400
l was here all along...
when did she leave?

682
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,500
l don't know that.
But she has left.

683
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,200
Magan has....
Why did you take me there, father?

684
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,400
She has suffered injuries.
l think she has been raped.

685
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,200
This is serious. You must
immediately lodge a police complaint.

686
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,400
Why did you take your daughter
there on a Sunday?

687
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,900
Who knows why you went there!

688
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,200
She has been raped.
But why be humiliated in court?

689
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,700
You told me she was raped!
- l suspected it.

690
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:57,500
Why don't you understand?

691
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:02,200
l know what you're after.
Go and take the money from Gupta.

692
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,600
l can make him give you
50 or 60,000.

693
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,000
l can't prepare a report
based on mere suspicion.

694
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,400
Take my suggestion and
have her married quickly.

695
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:09,000
Kavita died.

696
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:16,400
l don't know what strength
her eyes gave me...

697
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,700
but l decided...

698
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:24,900
... to take revenge
for the atrocity!

699
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:30,900
l kept looking for an opportunity
for six long months.

700
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:37,700
And one fine day, l saw him
at Ramakant Dua's gathering...

701
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:48,700
Kavita's shrieks engulfed me
the moment l set my eyes on him!

702
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:01,200
My hand moved on its own and
l pumped six bullets into him!

703
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,600
l have paid a homage to my
daughter by killing Maganlal Gupta.

704
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,900
lf this amounts to terror...
l am definitely a terrorist.

705
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,500
Where are you going?

706
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:47,000
To my wife, Laxmi.

707
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:52,500
She's all alone. l must meet her
before the police catch up with me.

708
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,800
l beg of you...
please don't call the police.

709
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
No, we aren't calling the police.
We're television journalists.

710
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,200
We'll try and see that the
truth is conveyed to the public.

711
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:12,300
How will you do it?
- She's right.

712
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
We've played many gimmicks to
sell falsehood on television.

713
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,300
And we will do something now
to tell the truth.

714
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,500
You must stay here.
Don't go anywhere.

715
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,700
We'll return soon.
So stay here.

716
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:51,500
lt's so very wrong for a decent
man to go through all this.

717
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:57,500
We've promised to help him, Ajay.

718
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,500
But how will we do it?

719
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:03,900
Our bosses are friends of the
political leaders. They'll not agree.

720
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:11,600
Businessmen have no friends.
They befriend only money.

721
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,100
We will exploit
this very weakness.

722
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:19,600
How?
- As you say, ''just like that''.

723
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:35,400
My money, mister. Where're you going?
- One moment!

724
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,600
We have on tape the story of the man
everybody thinks is a terrorist!

725
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,100
Think it over!
- l'm doing my work-outs!

726
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:53,300
l can't do two things at a time.
- You can do anything, Kaka!

727
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:57,600
Once his interview is telecast,
it'll create a sensation!

728
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,600
Are you out of your mind?!

729
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,900
Ramakant Dua will have
our channel shut down!

730
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:09,100
He will be the chief minister
only when he wins the elections.

731
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:13,400
But think of our profits if we
telecast Mohan Joshi's interview.

732
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,100
Think of the sponsors
and the advertisements!

733
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:19,800
lt'll make you famous in the world!
- Really?

734
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,500
Of course. But there's a problem.
- What is it?

735
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:29,100
We'll have to share this exclusive
interview with Galaxy TV.

736
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:33,600
You mean you will sell the news
coverage to my enemy, Kaka?!

737
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,300
We'll have to, sir. Ajay Bakshi was
there, when l did the interview.

738
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:42,500
Forget your false pride, Kaka!
This episode involves millions!

739
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,600
Millions?! Really?
- Absolutely!

740
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:46,700
So l'll suppress my ego!

741
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,800
lt's okay on my part.

742
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,500
C'mon, sir...

743
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,000
Shake hands... Go on.

744
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,400
l said, shake hands.
Not merely touch!

745
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,000
Like this!

746
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:32,000
Not her... it's him!

747
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,500
lt involves millions!

748
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:43,400
Gotcha! Dump the international
terrorist in the boat!

749
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,000
Let's go...

750
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:49,500
appu! Where are you taking him?!
- Lay off!

751
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:51,400
What are you up to?!

752
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,200
l've been fishing!
Can't you see?

753
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,200
lease let him go...
he's not a terrorist!

754
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,400
We've seen it all on TV!

755
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:03,200
The cops are after him
and he's in our custody!

756
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,400
That was a lie!
Mohan Joshi is no terrorist.

757
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,700
No? We're not gangsters then!

758
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:15,100
Go away before l lose
my temper and blast you!

759
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Let's go, guys.

760
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:26,100
You're making a mistake!
That man is not a terrorist!

761
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:29,100
Turn around... they've left.

762
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:34,900
The cowards!
They're running for their lives!

763
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:39,300
Face me if you have the guts!
- Face him!

764
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,900
l'll teach you guys a lesson!
- He'll teach you a lesson!

765
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:44,100
Go ahead and tell them...
- Sure, l have.

766
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,800
They were scared of you.
- l was very angry.

767
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,100
l'd have thrashed all of them...
- What must we do now?

768
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,900
l think we ought to
save the old man.

769
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,600
l know that, too.
But how will we do it?

770
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:08,300
Will you marry me?
- Marry you?!

771
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:15,500
The most dreaded terrorist of the
world is in my custody, uncle!

772
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,600
My name is being flashed in
every newspaper and TV channel!

773
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,300
The boys are thrilled.

774
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:25,600
Chinese journalists, the Hyundais,
want to interview you.

775
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:31,300
See that? Journalists from China!
l'm going international!

776
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:04,300
What's Baba?
- That's a Chinese greeting.

777
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,500
You've got to say ''Baba''
and bow.

778
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:29,900
We have news that you have kidnapped
the most dangerous terrorist.

779
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:34,000
Your fame has spread to China!
- Hold it!

780
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:40,200
l think l've seen
this guy somewhere.

781
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:46,700
Certainly... you must know Bruce
Lee, right? l'm his brother.

782
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:51,100
This is my wife, Od Lee...
the fair-skinned beauty!

783
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:03,700
You love each other, l see.
- There's something fishy!

784
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,400
No publicity for you
if you think we're fishy!

785
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,100
Don't we want the publicity?
... wait there!

786
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,300
We made this den inspired
by a James Bond movie!

787
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:18,100
This is my rocket.

788
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:23,900
Does he drive the rocket?
- He's the international terrorist!

789
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:27,600
He has made me famous.
Go ahead and interview me.

790
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,300
What's she saying?

791
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:37,900
A photograph of both of you
would be very good.

792
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:41,400
With him, eh? D'you want me
to get him out? All right.

793
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
l'm Ajay Bakshi.

794
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:11,000
What's she talking about?

795
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:19,300
A snap with the gun, eh?
So tell me that!

796
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:34,500
Who are you?
- Ajay Bakshi! Nobody moves!

797
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,800
Come here, Baba.

798
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:41,300
l told you there was something...
- Shut up!

799
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:45,300
Or l'll blow your brains out!
Come with me, don... Let's go!

800
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,000
C'mon, don...
- You will pay for it!

801
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:54,000
Nobody moves...

802
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:56,700
l'll be the worst yet
if anybody follows us!

803
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,500
You need a haircut, feller!

804
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:09,000
Why are you laughing?
- That gun wasn't loaded!

805
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,500
So why did you raise your hand?
- Why must l tell him anything?

806
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,700
l can't lose face...!

807
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:19,400
How're you, doc?
And don't take that haircut!

808
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:28,700
C'mon, Baba... Nobody can
find us here. lt's very safe.

809
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:34,100
Actually, nobody ever comes here.
- You've taken a lot of trouble...

810
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:37,400
Don't say that, Baba. Wouldn't your
own children have done it too?

811
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,200
They certainly would!
C'mon in!

812
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:49,200
Whose house is this?
- Shahid's uncle's.

813
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,400
Does nobody live here?
- No.

814
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:55,900
Shahid's uncle is old.
We use it sometimes for our work.

815
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:58,500
Let me keep the tape on the pelmet.

816
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:03,400
No. l'll keep it in the drawer.

817
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:16,100
This is why you come
to this house!

818
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,200
No... you're mistaken.
- Who is she?

819
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,400
Shahid's aunt.

820
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:31,400
She's quite bold.
- And beautiful too.

821
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:38,900
And this woman here...
must be aunt Farida, right?

822
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:40,400
Yes!

823
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:46,300
Shameless man! You call your
girlfriends Shahid's aunts!

824
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,500
How can you say such
things, riya?

825
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,600
Aunts are like mothers...
and you call them my girlfriends!

826
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:58,800
They're elder to me... so how
l can ask them how to dress?!

827
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,300
l don't want to talk to you!
- l won't talk to you either!

828
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,800
You've been chasing me
since the day we've met!

829
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:07,200
Don't be under the impression
that l'm chasing you, okay?

830
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:08,900
You took liberties
0with me as a Chinese!

831
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
You sat on my lap too!
- Did l?!

832
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,300
Baba! Show Baba the pictures!

833
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:19,500
He has throw it away!
- Relax... why're you fighting?

834
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:27,200
l really think you are
made for each other.

835
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
lf you're so fond of fighting...
just get married.

836
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,300
There! You even think alike!

837
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:41,200
This how you fall in love.

838
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:46,000
Love silently closes
in on you...

839
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:50,300
and magically transforms
the world around you.

840
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:55,900
Want to see the magic?
So look into each other's eyes.

841
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,000
Not like this...
do it with love.

842
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,900
Now start dreaming of a world.

843
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:13,900
A world of love.
- And?

844
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:20,000
Where only the two of you live.
- And...

845
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,300
What are you doing?
- You look like James Bond now!

846
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:57,100
l've never worn such clothes.
- You must. Today's a special day.

847
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:00,300
What's so special?
- l won't tell... sit down.

848
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:04,600
l'll show you some magic today.
- Really

849
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,300
Sure. l'll bring a smile to
your lips in just a second.

850
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:10,800
l smile every time
l see you, dear.

851
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,800
You don't understand...
this smile will be special!

852
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,100
Shut your eyes... go on!

853
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:31,300
lt's Ajay!
And where's the magic?

854
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:37,300
Look at that!

855
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:17,500
The fugitive Mohan Joshi
has still not been arrested.

856
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:22,500
lnformed sources have told us
that this dreaded terrorist...

857
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:26,200
was seen in the company of
a couple of television journalists.

858
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:31,000
Do you know where this
dreaded terrorist is?

859
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:35,200
Tell them...
- No. You tell them.

860
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:42,700
He has told me everything.

861
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:47,400
We cannever forget
what you've done for us.

862
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:54,900
l had these bangles made
for my daughter.

863
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:58,200
l thought l'd give it
to her in marriage...

864
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,600
You are our daughter now.
You must wear it for your wedding.

865
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:07,400
lease don't refuse it.

866
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:20,700
Ajay, my boy!
...where's the guy?

867
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,100
So you are Mohan Joshi?
You are fantastic, l say!

868
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:29,900
You've stirred the nation
with just one killing!

869
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,300
C'mon, let's go.
- We have a cassette of his story.

870
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:37,200
Yes! There is the cassette!
- To hell with it!

871
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:39,600
We have the living
proof before us!

872
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,900
You can say everything you want to!

873
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:48,600
The whole world will watch you live!

874
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:52,400
You will accompany me, won't you?
- Everyone knows they're with you!

875
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:56,100
They're celebrities, TV stars!
They'll be caught in a jiffy!

876
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:57,300
So come with us!

877
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,800
You need not be afraid, Baba.

878
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:06,300
State every fact on TV
without any hesitation.

879
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:12,100
You have our support.
- Take care, Laxmi.

880
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:18,000
Just don't worry, lady!
We stand by the truth!

881
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:20,000
Let's go... careful.

882
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,200
My brother-in-law has
ruined the whole show.

883
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,900
What do you want me to do?

884
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:47,200
Give me the support
of your 40 legislators.

885
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:51,200
Or the old man's story
will strip you in public!

886
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,700
Have a heart!

887
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,700
Atleast respect our enmity,
if we can't be friends!

888
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,400
Give me the support of your MLAs
and l'll make you the deputy CM.

889
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:10,000
That's spoken like a leader!

890
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:14,900
That old man's story mustn't be
leaked. l want to win the elections.

891
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:18,200
Don't worry... l play the cop.
So why fear?

892
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:22,000
Great! The two of you have
reached a compromise!

893
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:24,200
But we end up losing millions!

894
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:30,700
Let's give them both permission
for 24-hour non-stop channels.

895
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:35,000
That's something!
- Everyone has truly benefitted!

896
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:38,100
What will we do with the old man?
- To hell with him!

897
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:41,700
The public thinks he's a terrorist;
so let him be!

898
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:50,400
The police have nabbed the dreaded
terrorist Mohan Joshi...

899
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:54,100
who was responsible for killing
the industrialist, Maganbhai.

900
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:58,200
How did this happen?
- According to police sources...

901
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,700
he has the support of the
extremist group, the lSO.

902
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:14,400
Meanwhile, Mr Ramakant Dua...

903
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:18,600
... has merged with
the National arty.

904
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:30,100
Ajay! We have a 24-hour
non-stop channel!

905
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:32,300
The Government has given us
the permission!

906
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:36,800
And all this only thanks to you!
Come, let's embrace my boy!

907
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:45,800
You are worse than the third-rate
man l thought you were, Kaka.

908
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:51,000
Which is why l'm successful!
Look at this empire!

909
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,600
l have no qualms...
l run after money!

910
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,500
But that's business...
you won't understand it.

911
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:05,500
l'm the one on whose strength you're
running this channel and business!

912
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:08,800
You live off my name
and hard work!

913
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,800
Make any mistake...

914
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:18,600
but don't ever suffer
from illusions, son.

915
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:22,300
Who do you think you are?
l can deliver 10 more Ajay Bakshis!

916
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:27,600
The one who's on TV is the star.
That's the rule of television!

917
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:34,500
l'll make them pay you for
the tape you have, feller.

918
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:38,000
l'd be happy to see you make
money... how much do you want?

919
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:39,300
Enough!

920
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:47,500
l'm not here to strike a deal today.
Nor am l here to sell myself.

921
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:52,500
l've come here to
get back my freedom.

922
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:56,200
But don't think l've been defeated.

923
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:00,000
l will save Baba somehow.

924
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,900
Make sure you save yourself!

925
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:18,000
Hot-blooded youngster!
...you'll always be welcome, Ajay!

926
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,200
Make a call to the CM.

927
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:24,500
Haven't you taken enough
of beating, old man?!

928
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,200
Where's the tape?
Tell me!

929
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:31,500
You, sir?!

930
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:36,600
Have you got the tape?
- He doesn't seem to know about it.

931
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:40,100
So what are you doing with him
if he doesn't know where it is?!

932
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:45,100
Dua and my government will both be
sunk if the tape isn't found!

933
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,600
You knew what to do with him!

934
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:52,900
Go away, Commissioner!

935
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:00,400
You're not a novice!
You know what is to be done!

936
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:04,300
Get Ajay, if this old man
doesn't know where the tape is!

937
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,300
lf he doesn't speak,
get hold of the girl!

938
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:11,900
lf they still don't sing...
you know what this is, don't you?!

939
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:17,100
Kill them, so the matter
will be buried forever!

940
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:19,600
No! Don't kill them!

941
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:24,600
l'll tell you...
but you mustn't kill them!

942
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:29,800
l'll tell you where the tape is.
l know where it is!

943
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:34,100
Don't kill them...
l'll give it to you in writing!

944
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:37,500
l will also put in writing
that l'm a terrorist...

945
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:42,000
just don't kill my kids!
lease don't do that!

946
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:46,800
l will do anything you say...
don't kill my children!

947
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:10,800
The tape is missing, Ajay!

948
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:17,300
Here's the tape, sir. He
has signed a statement we dictated.

949
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,700
Keep this document with you.

950
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:24,300
Keep this tape carefully, Kaka.
- Me?

951
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:27,000
l live in government accommodation...
anything could happen.

952
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,700
Why mustn't we destroy the tape?
- No!

953
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:33,800
Dua does not know this tape exists.
He mustn't be told either.

954
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:35,500
l'm with you, sir!

955
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:39,500
lf Ramakant Dua as much as
thinks of toppling my government...

956
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:42,700
l can use this tape to
make him dance to my tunes!

957
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:44,900
l see the point, sir.

958
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,400
oliticians can't be trusted.
- You're right, sir.

959
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:58,500
We can do another
interview, riya.

960
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:23,900
They've got the tape, Baba.
l don't know how...

961
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,200
lt was l who gave them the tape.
- You?!

962
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:34,200
Why did you give it to them? lt...
- Relax, Ajay.

963
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:36,700
Look at his condition.

964
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:39,700
Are you okay, Baba? They haven't...
- Wait a moment, Rhea.

965
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:44,300
We can do another interview, Baba.
- What for? l'm really a terrorist.

966
01:55:44,900 --> 01:55:48,600
l am really a terrorist.
- Don't say such things!

967
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:51,100
We can try to...
- Don't try anything.

968
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:56,800
Ask me any number of times and
l'll repeat ''l'm a terrorist'' !

969
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:59,100
No! You're not a terrorist!

970
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:04,300
You are committing suicide!

971
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:08,600
We didn't extend support
to pull out halfway through!

972
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:14,100
We don't have the tape, okay!
But we can do another interview!

973
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,600
We'll have it shown on other channels
or published in the newspapers!

974
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,300
Can you bring back my daughter?

975
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,100
Can you give me back
my daughter?

976
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:32,100
You can't! You don't understand!
They're very powerful people!

977
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:36,800
eople like me are always sacrificed
in this game of power and money!

978
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:41,600
lt makes no difference if one man
from a billion is dead!

979
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
lt does make a difference
to us, Baba.

980
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:54,200
Make them see reason, Laxmi!

981
01:56:55,200 --> 01:57:00,300
We have lost our daughter...
we can't lose our children again!

982
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:06,300
l know you will grieve
at my decision...

983
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:11,200
but you do understand, don't you?
- Yes.

984
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,500
Make them see reason.

985
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:32,500
lease take care of Laxmi
after l'm dead.

986
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:41,500
No, Baba...

987
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:50,900
We won't look after her.

988
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:56,200
You will!

989
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:01,900
You will look after
all of us!

990
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:12,400
Mohan Joshi, who has links with the
terrorist group, the lSQ,...

991
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:18,700
has admitted to killing of top
leaders and spreading terrorism.

992
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:22,700
Keeping in view the security
of the country, this court...

993
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:25,700
pronounces death by hanging
for the terrorist.

994
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,900
Are you crazy to telecast the
old man's hanging live, Kaka?

995
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:38,300
You mean people will sit in their
drawing rooms and watch him hang?

996
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,100
ls this a joke?
lt has never happened before!

997
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:46,100
Why not? Don't people watch
wars on television?

998
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:49,400
Aren't the fights in arliament
telecast live, too?

999
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:53,400
We can rake in millions, sir!
Think of the ads we'll get!

1000
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:56,300
Sponsors are willing to
pay for anything sensational.

1001
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:58,600
Be it cricket, a war
or even a hanging!

1002
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,600
Chinoy is right.

1003
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:05,900
eople in the country know that the
old man is a foreign terrorist.

1004
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:10,600
We'll say `this is what will befall
anyone who dares eye our country!'

1005
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,600
No...

1006
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,300
All right. Let's make his hanging
an event of national interest.

1007
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:24,300
We will set a precedent and history
will remember our government...

1008
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:29,300
for showing firmness in
handling the country!

1009
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:33,600
Make the announcement!
A hanging will be telecast live...

1010
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:38,200
in the world's largest
democracy... glory to lndia!

1011
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:43,800
Look at this, sir.
A new idea to sell hair-dyes!

1012
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:51,200
Great! l want a huge poster...
l've taken a lot of money from them.

1013
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,500
Will my product sell
after the hanging?

1014
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:56,300
l'll personally it, feller!
Just give me the cheque!

1015
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:02,500
lt's a true story, sir...
- l know.

1016
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:06,300
eople in the media can accept
small frauds... not such a truth!

1017
02:00:09,700 --> 02:00:13,000
Your newspaper will have a better
image if you publish this story.

1018
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:18,500
l understand business, Ajay.
l can't go against the government!

1019
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:22,500
The CM's call, sir.
- Yes, Mr CM ?

1020
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,700
Have you collected enough?
- What an understatement, sir!

1021
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,900
We've made enough for
seven generations!

1022
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:37,400
Let there be a hanging
every year, God!

1023
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:42,400
Should you telecast this item
on your channel, sir...

1024
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:47,700
we might be able to save Baba.
- Why don't you understand?!

1025
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:54,100
Will Mohan Joshi support me if
Ramakant Dua sues me for defamation?

1026
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:57,900
That man you're fighting for
is not willing to support you.

1027
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:00,700
So how can l endanger my
channel worth 2 billion?!

1028
02:01:01,100 --> 02:01:06,700
Baba's scared, sir...
- l'm scared too. So what do l do?

1029
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:10,200
What are you running this
office for? Shut it down!

1030
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:12,600
You don't care for a man's life
and talk about millions!

1031
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,600
What's wrong with you? Why vent
your anger on someone else?

1032
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:28,600
Why did you shout at him?
- What else can l do?

1033
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:31,400
An innocent man is being killed
and we're just watching!

1034
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:34,100
And we've lost that tape;
the crucial evidence!

1035
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:40,600
Think calmly. There is someone who
can help us retrieve the tape.

1036
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:45,800
Who can help us, Rhea?!
- That publicity hound, the don.

1037
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:53,500
The tapes are in there, appu...
- Shut you, you cheat!

1038
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:56,600
This man betrayed me!
He came in the disguise of a Chinese!

1039
02:01:57,200 --> 02:02:01,300
He even brought a girl along!
Such are the things he does!

1040
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:05,000
He has made me an object of ridicule
in the underworld, you know.

1041
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:09,500
Don't you trust me, appu?
- Sure, l do, sis...

1042
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:12,600
l will get the publicity, won't l?
- Sure you will...

1043
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:14,800
The house belongs to a politician!
You're robbing the thieves!

1044
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:20,600
Shut up, or l'll whack you!
- What can be more sensational?

1045
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:23,100
Go ahead and steal
the tape... please.

1046
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:25,800
Very well, sis...
l'll do it for you.

1047
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:33,000
Where's the tape? Tell me!

1048
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:37,800
l know it's in the farmhouse...
but l can't say where.

1049
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:42,800
l could shoot you, you...!
What kind of a sidekick are you?!

1050
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:49,200
How will we find the tape
in such a big farmhouse?

1051
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:52,700
Where would you keep the tape,
if you were in Kaka's shoes?

1052
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:58,000
ln the safe, of course.
- Where would you hide a copy of it?

1053
02:02:58,600 --> 02:02:59,900
ln the same place.
- That's it then.

1054
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:03,200
We must take this copy to the
place where the original is.

1055
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:05,700
Why mess around if you have a copy?
- lt's not true, appu.

1056
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:08,400
We didn't make a copy of it, Ajay.
- Right!

1057
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:13,200
But that's something only you
and l know. They don't.

1058
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:20,500
Congrats on the launch
of the 24-hour channel!

1059
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:29,700
Who says the country is not united?
We'll all sharing the spoils!

1060
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:35,700
Congratulations, Kaka.

1061
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:40,100
What makes you come here, Ajay?

1062
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:45,100
Well? ls this how much you love me?

1063
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:48,600
Won't you forgive your son?

1064
02:03:48,900 --> 02:03:54,400
You had walked out on me!
- Yes. He instigated Rhea too!

1065
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:58,400
He had kicked his job in the
presence of so many people!

1066
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,800
l kicked the job... but it was
my feet that were hurt.

1067
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:08,600
l have realised that l am worth
nothing on my own!

1068
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,600
You have come to know
the power of power!

1069
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:17,900
lt was only after we got hold
of the old man's tape...

1070
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:20,400
that you come to me,
wagging your tail!

1071
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:25,400
You're right, Kaka.
And l salute power now.

1072
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:28,800
But l haven't come to you
because of the tape.

1073
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:31,300
l've been your student,
after all.

1074
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:35,600
How could you assume there'd be
no copies of such a precious tape?

1075
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:40,500
l have a copy! But it has nothing
to do with the original or...

1076
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
What's happening here?

1077
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:52,600
We have it made!

1078
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:56,800
When did you arrive?
- Just now... what tape is this?

1079
02:04:57,200 --> 02:05:00,300
Songs of the Goddess, sir...
meant for sinners like me.

1080
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:06,000
What are Ajay and Rhea doing here?
- We've forgiven them, you know...

1081
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:08,600
... it's all settled!
Look after him, Chinoy!

1082
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:14,500
You were about to ruin the show!
Dua doesn't know about the tape!

1083
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:18,600
You've forgiven me, haven't you?
- Sure, l have. Forgive me too!

1084
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,300
Where's the tape?
- Don't worry, l'll keep it safely.

1085
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:57,600
Ajay has escaped with the tape!

1086
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:01,300
ldiots! Don't stand and watch!
Go after them!

1087
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:20,000
l'm scared, Ajay!
- No... don't be scared!

1088
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:41,000
Take a right, Ajay...
- No. We'll take a left.

1089
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:42,300
Take a right, l say!

1090
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:55,700
Where are we, Ajay?

1091
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:05,500
Send another car.

1092
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:12,000
We're atleast alive... and safe.
- No. There were 2 cars chasing us.

1093
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:14,000
So where's the other?

1094
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:16,200
l'd asked you to be careful!
We've lost the tapes and the couple!

1095
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:21,400
lf my political career is affected,
everybody sinks with me!

1096
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:23,500
What?
- Everybody sinks with me!

1097
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:27,200
So what do l do? Halt the hanging?
- The hanging is tomorrow, sir.

1098
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:29,100
We've accepted millions
fom our sponsors!

1099
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:31,800
Don't worry, sir.
l'll handle everything.

1100
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,100
Leave the responsbibility
of the cassette to me, sir.

1101
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:40,300
Check all the rooms
and the cupboards.

1102
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:47,400
What's all this about?
- We have a search warrant.

1103
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:52,300
They're not in here, sir.
- Where will he go?

1104
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:55,900
We'll crush his bones!
He dares challenge the government!

1105
02:12:56,500 --> 02:13:00,400
You have only worn the uniform...
but my son is performing your duty.

1106
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,100
Nobody moves from here
till l give instructions!

1107
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:27,600
They've even raided our homes!

1108
02:13:31,500 --> 02:13:35,100
Don't worry... we must somehow
manage to spend this night.

1109
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:49,200
Hurry up, mister. l've got to
watch the hanging on TV.

1110
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:51,500
l've got to close shop and
watch the hanging too.

1111
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:54,300
Not this road, it's jammed.
l must reach home quickly.

1112
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:58,500
All roads are empty.
Everyone's watching the hanging.

1113
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:02,700
lt's almost time for
the hanging... let's go.

1114
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,600
A hanging of this kind
is terribly vulgar.

1115
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:08,200
Certainly not! lt will send
a message to the world!

1116
02:14:08,300 --> 02:14:10,900
Anyone eyeing our country
will meet with this fate!

1117
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:13,000
The bloody terrorist!

1118
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:26,900
Don't be scared...
and be calm.

1119
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:37,500
Take those medicines
for your knee-joint regularly.

1120
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:40,500
Don't be lazy.

1121
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:45,600
You're listening, aren't you?

1122
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:50,900
We have a fixed deposit in the
bank, which matures in January.

1123
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:55,600
Make sure you sign the papers
properly and withdraw the money.

1124
02:14:57,400 --> 02:15:00,900
Don't create any problems for
yourself at the bank.

1125
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:09,400
Distribute sweets among the children
on Kavita's birthday.

1126
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:22,800
Don't cry... don't!

1127
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:29,800
Welcome to the Central Jail.

1128
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:34,800
Hurry up, dad. lt has begun.

1129
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:39,400
Let's take a look at the
arrangements for the hanging.

1130
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:45,900
A man's about to die and you're
giving me tea! l want a soft drink!

1131
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:49,100
The telecast has begun!

1132
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,500
Are the labels of the sponsors
in order? No one must take offence.

1133
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,800
Death ought to be
as colourful as this.

1134
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:01,100
Everyone must wish
for a death like this...

1135
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:03,500
and a ''Tipsy'' to guzzle!

1136
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:15,100
This is the TV station whose
control room we must reach.

1137
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:20,500
But we have just 10 minutes.
- The cops will be here by then.

1138
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:27,000
Stop the van... do you have
the permission to enter?

1139
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:30,700
l was asked to bring it to
this address... so l did!

1140
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:35,300
This is another building.
- Where is it written?

1141
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:37,500
Go away.
- Sure, l will.

1142
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,700
We now meet the one who will hang
Mohan Joshi. The hangman, Mahadev.

1143
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:55,400
ls it true that you're the
only hangman in lndia?

1144
02:16:56,100 --> 02:16:58,400
My father's a hangman too.
- Really?

1145
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:02,200
What's the secret of your strength?
Any special capsules?

1146
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:05,900
l use 40-plus!
- Why 40-plus?

1147
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:10,900
Because l've sent 40 men to death!
...that's a joke!

1148
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:15,900
Do you think hanging is okay
in a civilised society?

1149
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:20,400
My heart won't agree with
my needs... no comments.

1150
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:23,400
lsn't that right, Champa?

1151
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:26,600
Who's Champa?
- My wife... who else!

1152
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:33,900
Now for today's quizz: what is
the name of Mahadev's wife.

1153
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:37,600
The winner will get
several surprise gifts!

1154
02:18:00,600 --> 02:18:02,700
That pipe there is broken...

1155
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:17,800
This is not a hanging.
lt's a salute to nationalism.

1156
02:18:19,300 --> 02:18:20,600
lt's a warning to the traitors.

1157
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:23,900
The world will see what fate
befalls anyone...

1158
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:26,900
who casts an eye on Mother lndia.
- What he says is right!

1159
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:34,800
How did you get in?!

1160
02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:40,500
ut that tape in the
player, Rhea. Hurry up!

1161
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:47,700
Start the transmission
of this player!

1162
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:51,100
Start it, l say!
- l can't do it!

1163
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:55,600
What's most heartening is that all
political parties of lndia...

1164
02:18:55,900 --> 02:18:58,600
have backed the government on its
decision to the hanging.

1165
02:18:58,800 --> 02:18:59,800
Switch it on!

1166
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,600
We're showing a transmission
of the Chief Minister!

1167
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:05,200
Stop that... and begin
showing our tape!

1168
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:07,300
Hurry up!

1169
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:23,000
We will hang a hundred such traitors
to maintain the unity of our country.

1170
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:30,700
l'm not a terrorist!
l am not!

1171
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:33,500
- What's this?
- How's this telecast happening?

1172
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:37,300
l am not a terrorist!
- Stop that, someone!

1173
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:41,000
l'll be ruined!
Call the police! Have it stopped!

1174
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:47,000
l had a daughter called Kavita.

1175
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:50,400
She wanted to take up a job
after her graduation.

1176
02:19:51,100 --> 02:19:54,900
But Maganlal Gupta made her
a victim of his lust...

1177
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
on the day of the interview.

1178
02:19:58,400 --> 02:20:00,900
My daughter was lying in hospital,
fighting against death...

1179
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:03,000
and l was running from
pillar to post.

1180
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:05,400
My daughter died.

1181
02:20:05,700 --> 02:20:09,500
l don't know what strength
she gave me...

1182
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:15,700
l decided to avenge
the outrage.

1183
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:21,400
One fine day, l spotted him at
Ramakant Dua's rally.

1184
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:27,400
My hand moved on its own.
And l pumped six bullets into him.

1185
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:30,400
Had there been ten bullets,
l'd have pumped all ten into him!

1186
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:36,600
l have killed Maganlal Gupta and
paid a homage to my daughter.

1187
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:42,200
lf this amounts to terrorism...
then l'm a terrorist.

1188
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:48,600
This was Mohan Joshi's real story.

1189
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:56,600
Mohan Joshi is no terrorist.
He's a helpless, common citizen...

1190
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:00,800
who has been implicated in
a web of political intrigue.

1191
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:04,400
Stop that bloody telecast!
Don'tjust talk on the phone!

1192
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:07,100
What has happened to Mohan Joshi...

1193
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,900
could very well happen
to you tomorrow.

1194
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,100
And why?

1195
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:20,600
Because Mohan Joshi happens
to be a common man.

1196
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,800
A straight-forward man
who's afraid of darkness...

1197
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:28,800
who's God-fearing
and law-abiding.

1198
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:35,000
Take Haryana, Bihar, Mumbai,
or anyplace in lndia...

1199
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:39,600
there are Mohan Joshi's everywhere.
Mohan Joshi's in you and me.

1200
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:48,100
Mohan Joshi's hanging today
will be a hanging for all of us!

1201
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:53,200
lt'll be the death
of a common man.

1202
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:59,700
Should we remain silent today,
all one billion of us...

1203
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:02,700
will be responsible for
the slaying of a single man!

1204
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Let's forget slogans...
and do what we must!

1205
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:17,200
lndia will not be great,
if we only raise slogans.

1206
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:22,800
lt'll achieve greatness only when
all of us go to the Central Jail...

1207
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:25,000
and oppose the hanging.

1208
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:33,000
Do not waste time thinking...
Heed your feelings today!

1209
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:36,000
The feelings of an lndian.

1210
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:47,700
l'm leaving with my friends
to save a common man.

1211
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:54,500
Should l succumb midway...

1212
02:22:58,300 --> 02:22:59,600
through my mission...

1213
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:05,700
l will surely look behind me...

1214
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:12,600
to find out whether
l'm all alone.

1215
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,900
l'll deal with you, swine!

1216
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:27,700
l've found them, sir.
They were hiding there.

1217
02:25:30,200 --> 02:25:32,700
Hiding, eh?
The revolutionary hero?

1218
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:36,900
You were a TV journalist and
you're now a leader, eh?

1219
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:43,100
Take her away!

1220
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:27,100
Get up, Ajay...

1221
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:34,600
Look! We're not alone!
We're not the only ones!

1222
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:20,700
The only way we can survive
is by killing the old man!

1223
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:24,400
Once he's dead, his interview
will have no importance.

1224
02:28:24,700 --> 02:28:27,500
We have his signed confessions.
So call the jailor!

1225
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:31,400
No. l'll personally go to
the jail to have him hanged!

1226
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:34,100
l can't trust anyone anymore!
- We've got a call through, sir.

1227
02:28:34,600 --> 02:28:36,600
What the hell are
you cops doing?!

1228
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:38,000
Ajay Bakshi has raised
a bloody storm!

1229
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:44,100
Clamp a curfew and order firing!
Let there be a carnage!

1230
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:46,400
No one must reach the prison!

1231
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:51,100
Quick! Let's go!

1232
02:28:54,900 --> 02:28:56,900
You will open fire, okay?

1233
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:29,400
Come no closer!
This is a warning!

1234
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:33,800
Another step forward
and you'll be shot!

1235
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:38,800
l have shoot-at-sight orders.
Halt there!

1236
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:07,100
No... l can't fire
at our Tricolour, sir.

1237
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:09,200
This isn't what l
joined the force for.

1238
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:42,500
Commissioner?
This is the Governor here.

1239
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,900
What's happening in the city?

1240
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:48,900
eople have taken to the streets
... who are they?

1241
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:51,500
Which political party
do they belong to?

1242
02:30:51,900 --> 02:30:53,500
Are they Hindus? Muslims?

1243
02:30:53,800 --> 02:30:56,200
They're neither Hindus
nor Muslims today, sir...

1244
02:30:56,400 --> 02:30:59,700
all of them are just lndians.
- So what needs to be done?

1245
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:03,900
l will do what l should, sir.

1246
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:06,900
Why isn't the old man dead?
- lt's not yet eleven, sir.

1247
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:09,100
lt's already Eleven!
- The Court ordered...

1248
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:12,500
l'm the Court and the Law today!
Go fetch him!

1249
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:29,400
Galaxy TV and KTV take you on
Mohan Joshi's lastjourney.

1250
02:31:29,900 --> 02:31:32,900
What must he be thinking...?
How must he be feeling?

1251
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,100
Would you like to say something?

1252
02:31:36,100 --> 02:31:38,100
Mohan Joshi is quiet and silent...

1253
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:40,600
but today will be the
last day of his life.

1254
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:43,200
We'll show you his lastjourney...
the deadly show!

1255
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:45,600
The hanging of Mohan Joshi!

1256
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:03,900
Do something... save him!
lease save him!

1257
02:32:12,700 --> 02:32:15,600
Hang him... Go on!
- Quick!

1258
02:32:27,500 --> 02:32:28,600
Let them through.

1259
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:41,400
Stop the hanging!
- What's up?

1260
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:44,300
The Governor's orders, sir...
he wants an enquiry instituted.

1261
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:52,300
l haven't received the orders.
Come after five minutes. Go away!

1262
02:33:30,100 --> 02:33:31,000
Stop him!

1263
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:16,700
Wait there, ladies and gentlemen!
And listen to me!

1264
02:34:17,100 --> 02:34:21,700
Ajay Bakshi is a liar!
He's making up stories!

1265
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:28,200
l am your elected leader...
l'll tell you the truth!

1266
02:34:31,900 --> 02:34:33,900
Listen to me...
l'm the Chief Minister!

1267
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:37,400
We made the mistake of
making you the C.M.

1268
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:39,300
Give it to them!

1269
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,800
The CM's being slippered!
Keep the cameras rolling!

1270
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:10,300
Are they... all here for me?
- Yes. They're here for the truth.

1271
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:16,800
May l say something to them?
- Of course. Get up.

1272
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:22,200
ass the mike, someone.

1273
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,100
You folks have given me
a new lease of life.

1274
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:38,100
l'm grateful to all of you...
to each one of you.

1275
02:35:40,700 --> 02:35:44,600
What l have realised today...

1276
02:35:45,500 --> 02:35:49,800
is that we lndians...
are not a herd gone wayward!

1277
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:55,000
We're an independent
and good people!

1278
02:35:58,900 --> 02:36:00,800
May the Truth Triumph!

1279
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:11,200
l have something to say.
- l want a word in first.

1280
02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:19,000
He always asked me
if l'd marry him.

1281
02:36:19,300 --> 02:36:21,200
No! l never asked her that!

1282
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:25,000
And l ask you today...
will you marry me?

1283
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:30,600
Say yes!

1284
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:49,000
l will marry you provided
you say, ``l'm the best''.

1285
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:51,000
Absolutely. l am the best!

1286
02:36:56,900 --> 02:36:58,900
Now say... you are the best!

1287
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:06,100
l think l must marry her.,,
