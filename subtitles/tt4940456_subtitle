"Love for the Sahib."

00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:17,833
"When the story is told in this alley ..."

18
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:21,125
"... echoes the sound of hooves."

"The Sahib continues to live forever."

23
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:17,708
"The others have spears in their hands."

24
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:23,083
"The Mirzya has a bow and an arrow."

25
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,250
"Look how it comes."

00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,250
"Life is as a burning fireball."

41
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,125

"And put fire in the heavens. O Mirzya!"

00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,167
"The wax melts of silence"

44
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,125
"A plant springs up from the fire,"

45
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,000
"Listening to your story."

46
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,042
"O Mirzya!"

"The Sahib continues to live forever. O Mirzya!"

55
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,750
"The earth still rotates around."

56
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,875
"It comes from somewhere or going somewhere."

00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:38,167
"It revolves around you, O Mirzya!"

58
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,833

Munish? - Yes sir.

You fell from heaven?

You were not here one minute before.

62
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,750

You can go.

74
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,792
Sir, I did not do my homework.

75
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,125
Not done?

76
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,917
You know the punishment?

77
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,417
Is not that right;

78
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,500

He crushed the wood.

83
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,833
Suchi, just say to your father.

84
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,375
I will not spare him the teacher.

Welcome!

00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,458
How was school?

Goodbye, Munish. - Goodbye.

What you Munish, my son?

If you look at the sky ..

..pos I can knit your hair?

97
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:10,750
Munish!

98
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,750
He left for school.

99
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,042
He said that the teacher called him early.

100
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,083
Okay.

101
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,708
Hey, good morning! - Good morning. How are you;

102
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,042
"It happens. Often it happens."

103
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,333
"In love happens ..."

104
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,042
"Someone is ringing."

105
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,208
"What else is hurt."

106
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,208
"Often it happens."

107
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:27,958
"It happens, it happens, it happens ..."

108
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,333
"Someone is ringing."

109
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:39,333
"What else is hurt."

110
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,917
"In love happens ..."

111
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:58,792
"In love happens ..."

112
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,833
"Often it happens."

113
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,167
"The sky is burning sun."

114
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,958
"And the stain is on earth."

115
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:15,167
"It happens ... in love!"

116
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:54,375
"The decision was not time for the sake of love."

117
00:19:55,417 --> 00:20:03,000
"The lover chained, and taken away."

118
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,042
"To love!"

119
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,833
"All the tricks tested."

120
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:35,875
"The lamps were filled with kerosene."

121
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,042
"All the tricks tested."

122
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,042
"The lamps were filled with kerosene."

123
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,000
"But if we do not see the flame in the match."

124
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:56,792
"Light will not exist."

125
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,208
"Even the henna gives color"

126
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,208
"Only after kopanithei well."

127
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,208
"Even the henna gives color"

128
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,000
"Only after kopanithei well."

129
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,125
"It happens, it happens."

130
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,542
"Often it happens. In love!"

131
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:19,917
"To love!"

132
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:24,125
"Someone knocks. And another is wounded."

133
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:37,125
"Sometimes it also happens"

134
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:42,917
"Friends to divide. But speaking of memories,"

135
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:46,333
"Even without talking, something told in whispers."

136
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:47,958
"The dried lakes"

137
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,083
"But the scratches remain on the earth ..."

138
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,875
"Those untold memories .."

139
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,083
"Baked forever in the hot sun."

140
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,917
"Sometimes, it happens ..."

141
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,042
"The sky is burning sun."

142
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:14,750
"And the stain is on earth."

143
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,250
"Often it happens. In love!"

144
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:31,125
"It happens, it happens, it happens .."

145
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,500
"Often it happens. In love!"

146
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,375
"With passion!"

147
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,000
"It happens."

148
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,292
"It happens."

149
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,792
"Often it happens. In love!"

150
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,792
"With passion!"

151
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,208
"It happens."

152
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,292
"It happens."

153
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,250
"It happens."

154
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,750
"It happens."

155
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:11,042
"O Mirzya!"

156
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,083
Hello, Adil Mirzya.

157
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,250
Come here.

158
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,083
Hit it off.

159
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:13,000
Very well!

160
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:16,417
Hey, dad.

161
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,333
My wish, my son.

162
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,417
I have not seen around here.

163
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,792
Forgot that nailed the horseshoe?

164
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:45,042
I learned from 'you, the hard way.

165
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,792
Tea;

166
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,833
Where is Rashid? - he has wings on his feet now.

167
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,958
Here it comes.

168
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,750
What's his name;

169
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:00,083
The White.

170
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,792
Obviously, it can not be black!

171
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:04,958
Sharp tongue!

172
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:08,208
Muna finished? - Be patient.

173
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,417
He has four legs, not two like you.

174
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:14,958
I mean it's time for your prayers, Muna.

175
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,917
Brat!

176
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,958
If I like him, write to me.

177
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,250
But your name means child.

178
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,375
He is the grandfather!

179
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,167
No need. - Take it.

180
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:41,458
Someday I will steal your money.

181
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,292
What are you going to do;

182
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,875
I will buy a machine like yours.

183
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:49,250
It is greater than 'you. Speak respectfully.

184
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:52,792
But you do not talk. Neither the Muna.

185
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:55,167
Let's go. - Take.

186
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,458
Put your hat.

187
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,792
Zinat, do not let Adil leave without having eaten.

188
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,833
Yes father.

189
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,333
Good boy!

Nothing changed, Maharaj.

195
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:24,292
Your son is living the same life with 'you.

196
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:26,417
What a surprise!

197
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:31,708

Modern kings build economic empires.

202
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,167
The less you know the young, the better.

203
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:54,917
Karan? - Yes.

204
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,792
The Commissioner is here with a warrant.

205
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:12,833
Get ready for a life sentence.

206
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,250
Sir, I declare culprit.

207
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:20,167

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,958
You're not here ... what to do?

216
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:09,292
Liar! When I'm gone, you drink more.

217
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,125
Only to drown my sorrows ...

218
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,042
Otherwise ... I will be sad.

219
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,792
Why are you sad? I'm not there!

220
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:25,250
Exactly!

221
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:30,750
Come back.

222
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,750
Very soon.

223
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:35,792
What was that;

224
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,917
This was a thunderbolt for your new arrival.

225
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:42,458
Came the rain clouds?

226
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:48,167

00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,417
The rains will come with you.

228
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:06,792
How are you; - Good. How are you

229
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,000

Already pale with rage.

233
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,083
Romeo and Juliet.

234
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,792
My Little Miss Shakespeare.

235
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,125
How are you;

236
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:34,125
I was well until now ... - But now I'm here ...?

237

238
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,750
And now a handsome prince will come with the white ..

00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:42,083
..alogo and will take away my angel.

240
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,458
Go. I'll get your things.

241
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,125
Can I take what belongs to you?

242
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:06,083
It's all yours. No longer belongs to me.

243
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,125
We will follow.

244
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,375
Dad!

245
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:24,875
Go! Go!

246
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,042
Our child is back home.

247
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,875
How was the flight;

248
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:36,167
Very lonely.

249
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:39,292
There is fun to travel such long distances alone.

250
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,750
I could fly in here.

251
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:43,583
Correctly.

252
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,875
You mean on the horse?

253
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,875

00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:16,750
"Big ears, thin legs, silky black hair."

257
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:24,042
"Angels fear the Black Horse."

258
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:30,708
"And God himself afraid Mirzya."

259
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,292
For the Princess.

260
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:10,875
Dad! Why such an expensive gift?

261
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,208
All will be yours someday.

262
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,250
What do you say, sir Rator?

263
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,417
The spoils, Maharaj.

264
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:25,917
He won a Prince and not spoil ..

265
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:28,333
..and will make some jewelry?

266
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
God will see. - Thanks. - Let's go.

267
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:39,833
Give me that.

268
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,292
It's amazing!

269
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,542
My mother wore the them for polo matches.

270
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:52,042
Your father brought me already like I'm your bride.

271
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:58,208
Basically, he wants to move to our palace immediately.

272
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:00,125
Oh really?

273
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,708
Will you learn to ride?

274
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:18,000
You are a princess. The riding is fitting.

275
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:24,375
"My beloved is away."

276
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:30,833
"Whenever he remembers me."

277
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:37,292
"I have hiccups."

278
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,292
Thanks.

279
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:42,542

A love song.

Sad. - Sad, lady.

287
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:19,042
But he knows that she will always be thinking about.

288
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,958
Every time I think, he has hiccups.

289
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500

366
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:43,292
You go to Jodhpur?

I went to school there.

369
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,250
I had a buddy friend.

370
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:52,000

375
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:09,375
After we returned without pedaling.

376
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:13,375
The bike flew on slopes like the wind.

377
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,167
With you on?

378
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:19,958
I sat in front and there I caught the wheel.

379
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,708
It was scary and exciting.

380
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,208
The speed is exhilarating, Princess.

381
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,958
I'm not a princess.

382
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,333
Will you learn to ride it engine?

383
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,875
No.

384
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,375
The Prince will kill me.

385
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:54,333
I've seen how fast the car driver.

386
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:57,917
But as the Motorbike is nothing.

387
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:02,208
I want to fly like I did with him Munish.

388
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:10,208
The Munish, my best friend.

389
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:17,250
I do not know that disappeared.

390
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,750
"The pond ... bushes ..."

391
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:30,375
"My means ... dried."

392
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:38,292
"I have hiccups."

393
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,125
"I have hiccups."

394
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:48,750
"I have hiccups."

395
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:53,000
"Keeps me awake all night."

396
00:47:53,083 --> 00:48:01,125
"The pond ... bushes ... the dried within me."

397
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:04,000
The Munish always was late to school.

398
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:07,333
Sometimes we lost the bus.

399
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:09,833
It was so lazy.

400
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:13,875
Never did the homework.

401
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:18,208
Can you believe it; He never did.

402
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:29,333
But cared much.

403
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,292
He brings me my favorite dessert.

404
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:41,875
Princess!

405
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:44,833
Why do you continue to talk to me about him?

406
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:48,500
Go and look for them at the Primary School Gkovarntan.

407
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:08,083
Munish?

408
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:18,208
Where have you been;

409
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:27,750
I'm not a princess.

410
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:31,792
I am Suchitra.

411
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:36,500
You call me Suchi.

412
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:46,792
Remember I made this tattoo?

413
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,375
Look!

414
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:52,833
You did tattoo my name on your back!

415
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:59,542
Go tell your father that you found the runaway murderer.

416
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,833
Tell him to grasp.

417
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,750
Tsitothikes?

418
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,708
To tell yourself.

419
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:16,083
Liar!

420
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:24,958
With tricked for so many days!

421
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,208
I was talking about our past ...

422
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:32,875
... and you have nothing you said!

423
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,333
To deceive!

424
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:55,875
"With tickling."

425
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:01,458
"With tickling."

426
00:51:37,042 --> 00:51:38,333
"Munish!"

427
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:39,750
"Come on, lets go!"

428
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,875
"Hurry up! - I am coming!"

429
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:47,792
"I was always delayed."

430
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:51,375
"What did you do; - Practice on the mark. "

431
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:52,917
"Your bag."

432
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,833
"Your favorite dessert."

433
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,833
I love you.

434
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:04,750
I can not do this, Adil.

435
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:09,917
I can not.

436
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:24,875
Welcome to the family.

437
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:29,958
For you.

438
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:06,917
"Love does not need a mandate."

439
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:13,250
"The camaraderie is proximity."

440
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:21,208
"The talk is so easy."

441
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:26,375
"The talk is so easy."

442
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:31,917
"To book a vow, so difficult."

443
00:58:39,042 --> 00:58:40,958
What were you doing, Princess?

444
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:47,292
I told you I'm not Princess.

445
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:49,875
I am Suchi.

446
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:52,750
I can not call it so.

447
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:56,750
It is not right...

448
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,750
... to come here so late.

449
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,042
How did you come to see?

450
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:07,333
And if you ask? - No!

451
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:11,792
I would say that I came to see him Munish. - Suchi!

452
00:59:15,417 --> 00:59:17,375
I do not deserve you.

453
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:21,833
Prince Karan ...

454
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:25,292
He loves you.

455
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:31,458
And you;

456
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:38,125
You do not love me;

457
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:46,333
No.

458
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:53,958
No; - No.

459
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,500
What happened;

460
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:51,500
"She came wearing silky .."

461
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,125
"..Nychta on the delicate shoulders."

462
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,292
"He swings the .."

463
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:01,042
"..Fengari crown on his head."

464
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,417
"In what part will stop the time?"

465
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:13,792
"This was a princess, but"

466
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:19,458
"He had no prince."

467
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:54,833
"Oh lover!"

468
01:01:55,792 --> 01:02:03,417
"The partridge fly in the sky."

469
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:10,042
"The partridge, the partridge."

470
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,417
"The partridge fly in the sky."

471
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:20,542
"Flies to catch the moon."

472
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:27,083
"When love is flying on the edge."

473
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:30,083
"Cut off both wings."

474
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,792
"The partridge fly in the sky."

475
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,458
"Flies to catch the moon."

476
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:38,875
"When love is flying on the edge."

477
01:02:38,917 --> 01:02:40,500
"Cut off both wings."

478
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:44,333
"All the others burn in their own fire."

479
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,917
"And the moth, is moving in this fire, oh lover."

480
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:52,250
"He embraces the fire and burned."

481
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:55,958
"He embraces the fire and burned."

482
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,083
"He embraces the fire and burned."

483
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:59,458
"He embraces the fire."

484
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:01,750
"He embraces the fire and burned."

485
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,792
"He embraces the fire."

486
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,542
"He embraces the fire and burned."

487
01:03:05,542 --> 01:03:07,042
"He embraces the fire."

488
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,958
"In the house of love are everything."

489
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:31,792
"Even the invisible God, there."

490
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:35,583
"God is there."

491
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:40,292
"People have it all, but ..."

492
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:45,792
"Lovers when we have them?"

493
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:49,375
"Lovers when we have them?"

494
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,958
"This was a princess, but"

495
01:03:52,042 --> 01:03:56,375
"He had no prince."

496
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,750
"There was love in the alley of the blacksmiths."

497
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:04,333
"But for the blacksmiths there is no love."

498
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,792
"All the others burn in their own fire."

499
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:11,125
"And the moth, is moving in this fire, oh lover."

500
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:15,042
"Hugs, hugs."

501
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:16,792
"Hugs, hugs."

502
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:21,042
"He embraces the fire and burned."

503
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:23,833
"He embraces the fire."

504
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:26,375
"He embraces the fire and burned."

505
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:27,875
"He embraces the fire."

506
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:31,458
"He embraces the fire and burned."

507
01:04:52,417 --> 01:04:54,125
Wonderfully ...

508
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,250
Something else;

509
01:04:57,292 --> 01:04:59,292
It's yours now.

510
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:19,708
Come on boy!

511
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,292
Riding well!

512
01:05:41,042 --> 01:05:43,042
Very well! Great!

513
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:42,167
Where were you all these days?

514
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:44,875
From here Zinat.

515
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:46,250
Hello.

516
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:54,958
Nobody else knows me like this.

517
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,458
He knows my soul.

518
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,042
When I popped the prison ...

519
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,375
... I ran for five whole days and nights.

520
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:14,875
Collapsed here in the alley of blacksmiths.

521
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,125
When I opened my eyes again ...

522
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:21,167
... I saw the face of Zinat.

523
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:24,125
And the red glow of the furnaces.

524
01:08:25,917 --> 01:08:31,375
Who is she; - The princess.

525
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:32,875
The White belongs to 'you?

526
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:36,167
It belongs to Prince Karan. - Who is this;

527
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:41,333
The man you marry.

528
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:47,917
Why not marry Adil Mirzya?

529
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,333
Speak better.

530
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:56,292
Otherwise you will shut up? - Exactly.

531
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,917
They speak in riddles here.

532
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:07,375
I'll be right back.

533
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:41,167
The wedding gift of my late husband.

534
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:42,792
I give it to 'you now.

535
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
You're in love with Adil.

536
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:01,417
We are links in a great chain.

537
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:03,458
I cling to Adil.

538
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,250
The Adil with 'you.

539
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:07,792
And you with Prince Karan.

540
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:16,167
What are you doing; Not please.

541
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:18,458
I can not take your bracelet.

542
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:21,167
You will ruin the couple. - Does not matter.

543
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:23,708
I will give another in Munish.

544
01:10:23,792 --> 01:10:25,042
Munish?

545
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:29,500
Let's go.

546
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:34,917
Munish.

547
01:13:14,167 --> 01:13:17,917
"There comes a time ..."

548
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:21,875
"And we need to get to another."

549
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:26,792
"It was a passionate existence, windstorms caused."

550
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:28,958
"In the earth or above the horizon."

551
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,958
"Where should you look for them in one?"

552
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:35,292
"O Mirzya!"

553
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,958
"O Mirzya!"

554
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,792
"The earth still rotates around."

555
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:44,875
"It comes from somewhere or going somewhere."

556
01:13:44,917 --> 01:13:48,750
"It revolves around you, O Mirzya!"

557
01:13:52,292 --> 01:13:57,500
"Listening to your story, O Mirzya!"

558
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:06,708
"Listening to your story, O Mirzya!"

559
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:15,833
"O Mirzya!"

560
01:14:24,292 --> 01:14:25,417
It is OK.

561
01:14:26,042 --> 01:14:27,417
Sir!

562
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:29,792
Yes, Adil?

563
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:31,250
How are you;

564
01:14:31,792 --> 01:14:34,958
Sir, I want to remind you tonight safari.

565
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,292
There is a big festival in the desert.

566
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:37,417
Tourists may want a walk.

567
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:39,125
I know. - Yes.

568
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:41,792
Already promised in Suchi.

569
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:43,708
There's a full moon out tonight.

570
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,167
The perfect time for safari.

571
01:14:46,958 --> 01:14:49,917
Get the White, sir? - Of course.

572
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:52,042
Why dirty your hands?

573
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:59,000
Broke my Motorbike.

574
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,125
I asked you to learn to ride it machine.

575
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:05,750
No madam.

576
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:25,375
Suchitra.

577
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:33,292
I did not like what I just did.

578
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:37,833
It was indecent.

579
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,500
Are you princess now!

580
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:06,750
"He was a river that was running, cuddling .."

581
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:10,083
"..And the two coasts. It was a river."

582
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:14,000
"It was a river."

583
01:16:14,042 --> 01:16:16,750
"There is no shore leave uncovered."

584
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:18,875
"It was a river."

585
01:16:18,958 --> 01:16:22,167
"It was a river."

586
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:27,125
"If divided, there would flood."

587
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:31,000
"If divided, there would flood."

588
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:35,125
"And if twisted, the entire earth will turn around the mound."

589
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:37,958
"It was a river."

590
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:40,083
"He was a river that was running .."

591
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:42,208
"..Agkaliazontas both coasts."

592
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:45,042
"It was a river."

593
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:11,833
Sochi?

594
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:31,042
Sochi!

595
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:35,375
Munish!

596
01:17:42,208 --> 01:17:43,708
Munish!

597
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,250
Sochi, run!

598
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:13,917
Munish!

599
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:05,125
"The heart was a ruthless ruler."

600
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:09,292
"The kept chained."

601
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:11,833
"It was a river."

602
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,708
"The heart was a ruthless ruler."

603
01:19:16,792 --> 01:19:18,375
"The kept chained."

604
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:20,208
"It was a river."

605
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:23,792
"The kept chained."

606
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,917
"He was a river that was running .."

607
01:19:25,917 --> 01:19:28,083
"..Agkaliazontas both coasts."

608
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:30,167
"It was a river."

609
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:32,458
"He was a river that was running .."

610
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:34,833
"..Agkaliazontas both coasts."

611
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:38,792
"It was a river."

612
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:01,958
Do not worry.

613
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,833
It's a serious fracture? - No.

614
01:20:06,083 --> 01:20:08,917
You mean he can go home running?

615
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,792
Of course!

616
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:13,667
Hey, big boy!

617
01:20:14,958 --> 01:20:16,917
Hunting cats?

618
01:20:18,292 --> 01:20:20,208
You could not wait a while?

619
01:20:20,708 --> 01:20:23,917
You will get married quite soon. Right, Commissioner?

620
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:26,958
How are you, my prince.

621
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:28,958
I'm better, sir.

622
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:35,083
The Adil, saved my life.

623
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:41,250
You risk your life and saved the princess.

624
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,542
I could die many times for her.

625
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,667
You were very brave.

626
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:53,750
Go, my child.

627
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:56,250
You were awake all night.

628
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,875
My car is outside.

629
01:20:58,625 --> 01:20:59,875
Suchi.

630
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:04,708
Do not worry. I'll be fine.

631
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,458
Go rest.

632
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:14,250
God has a well, my child.

633
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:15,417
Go.

634
01:21:16,542 --> 01:21:18,542
Accompanied in the car.

635
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,667
The lioness is broken. Now it is more dangerous.

636
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,958
You have to kill the cat, son.

637
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,250
The wedding is approaching.

638
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:38,917
Maharaji decided.

639
01:21:50,292 --> 01:21:51,833
But he did not say when.

640
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:19,583
Neither said how.

641
01:22:37,208 --> 01:22:38,875
Sir; - Yes. Someone named Adil ..

642
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:40,417
..Mirzya is here to see you.

643
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:42,250
Adil?

644
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:47,375
Passed.

645
01:22:50,542 --> 01:22:51,958
How are you;

646
01:22:54,917 --> 01:22:56,917
Come and sat.

647
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:01,292
What brings you here?

648
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:08,375
Sir, I have to ask you something.

649
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:09,875
Front.

650
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:19,750
Sir, if a young boy ...

651
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,875
... a simple boy has committed a crime ...

652
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,958
... how long will be considered criminal?

653
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:35,875
The law can be hard ..

654
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:37,917
..alla and compassionate at the same time.

655
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,417
What happened;

656
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:45,625
Can you tell me, my son.

657
01:23:48,417 --> 01:23:50,958
You remember when you were in Jodhpur ...

658
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:56,750
A nine year old boy stole your gun.

659
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:03,917
Killed a teacher with this weapon.

660
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,833
Shot him and killed him.

661
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:29,250
He was a classmate of Suchi.

662
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:35,792
He loved Suchi.

663
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:40,375
Still loves her.

664
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:42,958
How did you change your name?

665
01:24:46,667 --> 01:24:48,542
We want to get married ...

666
01:24:51,417 --> 01:24:52,583
Get out!

667
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,292
Now!

668
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:18,292
So, then, changed his name?

669
01:25:19,792 --> 01:25:22,292
No one can escape the law, sir.

670
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:24,375
No!

671
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:28,708
The Royal Houses do not give a damn about the law.

672
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:33,542
This neutralized before the fire burn us all.

673
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:51,667
"His real name is Munish."

674
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:02,833
"Will you learn to ride it engine?" - "Suchi!"

675
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:18,708
"Why dirty your hands?"

676
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:20,292
"Will you learn to ride it engine?"

677
01:28:20,792 --> 01:28:22,500
"No one can escape the law, sir."

678
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:24,250
"His real name is Munish."

679
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:25,792
"The royal house did not give a damn about the law."

680
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:26,708
"How he changed his name?"

681
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:27,958
"Will you learn to ride it engine?"

682
01:32:28,542 --> 01:32:29,500
Suchi.

683
01:32:30,667 --> 01:32:33,542
The sound of your steps.

684
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:37,208
I can hear them.

685
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:39,833
Where are they coming from?

686
01:32:42,792 --> 01:32:44,333
return?

687
01:32:46,542 --> 01:32:47,917
Or leave?

688
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:54,958
You came back?

689
01:32:57,542 --> 01:32:59,000
Or leave?

690
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:14,375
The bonds of the heart are not cut with a saw. My daughter.

691
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:23,417
Cut ...

692
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,292
... operations like yours.

693
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:44,875
With ruined Suchi.

694
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:49,208
Enough!

695
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:01,250
And you...

696
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:36,292
"Oh lover!"

697
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:45,958
"Oh dear!"

698
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,375
"Oh dear!"

699
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:01,333
"The palankino left."

700
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:03,708
"The treasure of her love, she left."

701
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:06,583
"The palankino left."

702
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:10,333
"The treasure of her love, she left."

703
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:16,667
"My parents took care of the whole time."

704
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:20,458
"With pamper ..."

705
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,458
"... in the monsoon season."

706
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:26,458
"My mother still wakes up at night."

707
01:35:26,542 --> 01:35:31,458
"And with lulls."

708
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:35,667
"When I get out of the front door."

709
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:41,417
"When I get out of the front door."

710
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:45,667
"Then I will repay you all my debts to my parents."

711
01:35:46,917 --> 01:35:50,833
"Then I will repay you all my debts to my parents."

712
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:55,875
"In a box of vermilion gown, is hidden poison."

713
01:35:56,417 --> 01:36:00,542
"Poison for the bride, if not the favorite look."

714
01:36:03,625 --> 01:36:05,750
"Oh dear!"

715
01:36:06,917 --> 01:36:12,917
"Oh dear!"

716
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:18,708
"Oh dear!"

717
01:36:21,417 --> 01:36:23,417
my beautiful missy Shakespeare!

718
01:37:21,792 --> 01:37:24,583
"Oh raven!"

719
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:28,833
"Bring me the news of my beloved."

720
01:37:28,875 --> 01:37:32,417
"Oh raven!"

721
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:36,250
"Bring me the news of my beloved."

722
01:37:39,792 --> 01:37:48,542
"Did the crow die of thirst?"

723
01:37:48,833 --> 01:37:51,875
"Bring water in your beak."

724
01:37:51,917 --> 01:37:56,542
"Oh raven!"

725
01:38:47,708 --> 01:38:49,583
Suchi, get out!

726
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:51,917
Look, sit still.

727
01:38:52,917 --> 01:38:54,917
Please, bring the bride.

728
01:38:58,625 --> 01:38:59,417
What happened;

729
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:01,458
The door will not open!

730
01:39:01,458 --> 01:39:03,458
Suchi?

731
01:39:03,792 --> 01:39:05,792
Listen to view does not open!

732
01:40:11,625 --> 01:40:13,292
Edge!

733
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:16,875
Suchi opened!

734
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:21,292
Suchi!

735
01:40:31,667 --> 01:40:37,250
"It happens. It often happens in love. "

736
01:40:37,958 --> 01:40:40,292
"It often happens in love."

737
01:40:41,958 --> 01:40:46,792
"Someone knocks. What else is hurt. "

738
01:41:07,958 --> 01:41:10,708
We have news;

739
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:13,875
Sir, photos circulated everywhere.

740
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:18,292
Something must escape us.

741
01:41:22,792 --> 01:41:24,625
You helped me run away?

742
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:29,417
Who is the daughter of Inspector?

743
01:41:53,833 --> 01:41:55,000
Come on, son.

744
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:57,500
Everything is over.

745
01:41:57,875 --> 01:41:59,583
Nothing is over!

746
01:42:16,792 --> 01:42:18,292
Where will we go;

747
01:42:20,292 --> 01:42:22,250
Beyond the desert.

748
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:24,792
We will cross the border.

749
01:42:25,958 --> 01:42:28,833
When we get there, we'll see.

750
01:43:28,667 --> 01:43:29,500
You are OK;

751
01:43:58,417 --> 01:43:59,583
Your shoe.

752
01:44:12,333 --> 01:44:20,250
"There is no longer anything beyond the sky."

753
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,542
"Only the sky ..."

754
01:44:28,333 --> 01:44:31,917
"... you and I are here."

755
01:44:53,208 --> 01:44:57,000
"There are three witnesses of our love."

756
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:01,583
"One is God ..."

757
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:03,917
"... the other's you and me."

758
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:11,375
"Listen, why the earth resonates."

759
01:45:15,833 --> 01:45:20,542
"It's because the sky is listening to music."

760
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:28,750
"There are three witnesses of our love."

761
01:45:29,667 --> 01:45:33,625
"One is God ..."

762
01:45:33,667 --> 01:45:35,750
"... the other's you and me."

763
01:45:41,208 --> 01:45:45,333
"Let me open the sky and look."

764
01:45:45,625 --> 01:45:49,875
"If there is someone on the other side."

765
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:54,750
"Come on, maybe God is waiting for us."

766
01:45:59,583 --> 01:46:03,417
"Let us unite our souls."

767
01:46:03,458 --> 01:46:04,417
You gasoline?

768
01:46:04,417 --> 01:46:07,417
"Let's spread the fragrance of love."

769
01:46:07,542 --> 01:46:08,625
Only one bottle?

770
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:14,708
"It was a dream, and still is."

771
01:46:17,792 --> 01:46:21,333
"There are three witnesses of our love."

772
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:26,542
"One is God ..."

773
01:46:26,625 --> 01:46:29,375
"... the other's you and me."

774
01:46:54,333 --> 01:46:55,625
Munish!

775
01:48:11,542 --> 01:48:13,542
Where;

776
01:49:01,833 --> 01:49:03,500
We stayed out of gas.

777
01:49:06,625 --> 01:49:07,875
And now;

778
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:32,458
We have news; - Nothing, sir.

779
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:35,375
How far is the border? - 25 miles.

780
01:52:35,417 --> 01:52:38,333
We have alarms to patrol the border.

781
01:52:38,375 --> 01:52:41,000
We will catch them until sunset.

782
01:52:41,917 --> 01:52:43,875
Must.

783
01:54:43,667 --> 01:54:49,667
"Do not wear the noose of love."

784
01:54:51,833 --> 01:54:58,583
"This rope is endless, O Mirzya!"

785
01:55:00,208 --> 01:55:09,792
"You will never have the Sahib."

786
01:55:11,458 --> 01:55:16,542
"You will never have the Sahib."

787
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:22,875
"Do not born again, O Mirzya!"

788
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:58,292
"The earth was purple."

789
01:55:59,875 --> 01:56:05,208
"The sky was bronze."

790
01:56:07,458 --> 01:56:12,500
"Blood gushed from his forehead."

791
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:18,583
"His senses went out."

792
01:56:20,583 --> 01:56:23,375
How much farther? - Not much.

793
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:28,333
Will soon nightfall. We will leave at dawn.

794
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:48,458
How many bullets left? - Six.

795
01:56:49,833 --> 01:56:52,750
Enough? - How many will come to 'us?

796
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:58,375
Who knows; Many, though the police come.

797
01:57:00,333 --> 01:57:03,708
Perhaps Karan come.

798
01:57:09,208 --> 01:57:10,417
The first bullet is for ...

799
01:57:10,875 --> 01:57:12,250
... thy princes of Karan.

800
01:57:28,833 --> 01:57:30,375
The second;

801
01:57:32,292 --> 01:57:35,458
Perhaps Maharaja come.

802
01:57:36,667 --> 01:57:38,250
And your father.

803
01:57:39,958 --> 01:57:41,708
Definitely will come.

804
01:57:43,417 --> 01:57:47,625
So, the second bullet is for Maharaji.

805
01:57:50,583 --> 01:57:54,708
The third is for your father.

806
01:58:21,375 --> 01:58:22,542
And;

807
01:58:23,333 --> 01:58:25,333
The fourth ... about you.

808
01:58:28,875 --> 01:58:30,458
The fifth ... for me.

809
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:35,750
And the last?

810
01:58:36,583 --> 01:58:38,500
It could be for anyone.

811
02:00:53,375 --> 02:00:55,833
Suchi, climb on the horse!

812
02:01:15,833 --> 02:01:17,833
Munish!

813
02:02:03,875 --> 02:02:10,250
"Do not wear the noose of love."

814
02:02:12,208 --> 02:02:19,250
"This rope is endless, O Mirzya!"

815
02:02:20,583 --> 02:02:25,583
"You will never have the Sahib."

816
02:02:26,208 --> 02:02:32,375
"Do not born again, O Mirzya!"

817
02:02:52,417 --> 02:02:56,250
Suchi ...

"Generations pass through them ..."

820
02:04:48,375 --> 02:04:51,833
"... the valleys with dense fog."

821
02:04:53,375 --> 02:04:57,750
"Love never dies, O Mirzya!"

822
02:04:59,375 --> 02:05:05,500

"There comes a time ..."

824
02:05:31,542 --> 02:05:34,833
"And we need to get to another."

825
02:05:35,083 --> 02:05:38,958
"It was a passionate existence, windstorms caused."

826
02:05:39,792 --> 02:05:41,792
"In the earth or above the horizon."

827
02:05:41,833 --> 02:05:47,917
"Where should you look for them in one, oh Mirzya?"

828
02:05:48,250 --> 02:05:50,250
"O Mirzya!"

829
02:05:53,583 --> 02:05:55,583
"The wax melts of silence."

830
02:05:55,583 --> 02:05:57,583
"A plant springs up from the fire."

831
02:05:57,625 --> 02:06:01,625
"Listening to your story, O Mirzya!"

832

"The earth still rotates around."

840
