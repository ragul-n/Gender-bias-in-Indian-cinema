31
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,860
Dear God, don't be upset
I have a small shrine for you now.

32
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,900
I'll make it big and erect statues
worth crores for you.

33
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,820
I need your blessings for that.

34
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,660
I'm just a Councillor today.

35
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,620
I want to be an MLA like you,

36
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,340
become the Chief Minister
and hold permanent office.

37
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,340
Even kids won't make
so much money playing a game of Business.

38
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,740
But you made all that money
and fled the country.

39
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,700
Grant me that skill.

40
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,860
Bless me

41
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,140
Grandfather, it's Ok if I don't become
as great as them.

42
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,060
Even invalid currency
can be used to make a garland.

43
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,220
I swear I'll never become
like your good-for-nothing son.

44
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,500
Never! Never! Never!

45
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,460
'Awaiting our leader's return', says...

46
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,900
Bhojappan anxiously in an interview.

47
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,580
'Voice of the motherland.'

48
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,140
'Thirukural'

49
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,620
Dad!

50
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,020
(Recalling a verse from 'Thirukkural')

51
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,020
What happened, father?

52
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,460
Dad, do you have any pain?

53
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,420
Do you want water?

54
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,740
You stupid fellow,
how dare you call ours a minority rule?

55
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,020
Ours is a democracy.

56
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,260
If I catch you, you are done.

57
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,820
I've spent many sleepless nights
yearning for his affection.

58
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,300
One day won't do
to tell you all about it.

59
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,820
LKG
Stand up.

60
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,700
Didn't you get the circular?

61
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,980
Why didn't your parents come?

62
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,100
I don't have a mother.

63
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,620
My father has gone
to attend a meeting.

64
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,100
What's more important than this?

65
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,300
The party members are gathering for
a meeting near your house today.

66
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,940
Is your father an orator?

67
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,220
Yes.
He talks even in his sleep.

68
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,940
My student's father is giving a speech.

69
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,300
I heard he is a great orator.

70
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,260
Listen you guys from the Opposition.

71
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,100
My leader can have anyone as a mistress.
What's your problem?

72
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,340
It's for him to have one or many.

73
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,660
How does it matter to you?

74
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:52,020
You only know
how to snoop around and cause trouble.

75
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
You shouldn't be judgemental.

76
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,260
Shall I bring to light the...

77
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,780
Such crude language.
It's intolerable.

78
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,180
Children are
usually proud of their father.

79
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,300
But I was ashamed of mine.

80
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,660
Father, I want to pursue higher studies.

81
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,860
I need a recommendation letter.

82
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,220
Which school?

83
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,660
I finished school last year.

84
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,820
Remember, I failed in Maths.

85
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,540
You failed in Maths?
You idiot!

86
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,860
'Only education
can discern the wise from the foolish.'

87
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,220
I'll even take a beating,
but please don't recite the 'Thirukkural'.

88
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,180
I passed the exam.

89
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,420
Just get me a recommendation letter
from someone influential.

90
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,860
Who could have more influence
than me at Lalgudi?

91
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,260
You get me admission then.

92
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,660
- Which college?
- Rajappa Engineering College.

93
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,380
My friend owns the college.

94
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,740
I've given several speeches there.

95
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,500
I'll call the police.

96
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,260
Who is your father?

97
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,620
He is the spokesperson for his party.

98
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,940
The owner of this college
is his friend.

99
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,900
I own this college.

100
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,700
He has given many speeches in your college.
Don't you remember?

101
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,340
His name is Azhagu Meiyappan

102
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,540
Nonsense!

103
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,340
He wasn't
allowed to set foot in here.

104
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,100
He is useless himself
and you come with his recommendation?

105
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,900
I'll make sure
you don't get admission in any college.

106
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,900
What happened?

107
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,020
Did you get admission?

108
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,180
Can he recommend me too?

109
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,180
Of course! I can help your brother too.

110
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,620
Long live Minister!

111
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,300
Despite being in politics
for 30 years,

112
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,740
he's neither earned fame nor
wealth or even respect.

113
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,500
He is a loser.

114
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,620
I swear
I'll never become like you.

115
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,620
'Respect the wise
or face the consequences.'

116
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,100
- Good morning
- Good morning, uncle

117
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,020
The elderly please step forward.

118
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,780
Make way for her.

119
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,380
What?

120
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,780
Help us get the aid for the seniors.
It will help.

121
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,060
Who is this?
Your boyfriend?

122
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,980
- My husband.
- Feeling shy?

123
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,380
I'll put in a word.

124
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,300
Sister, what is the matter?

125
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,220
They recently moved in next door.

126
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,540
They say they are in love.

127
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,260
Love?

128
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,420
We've become
the laughing stock of the village.

129
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,700
We've even gone to the police.

130
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,980
Why go to the police
when he is there?

131
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,900
Have you finished your studies?

132
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,340
Yes.
Last year.

133
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,700
- What about you?
- In second year of college.

134
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,740
- Is your love true?
- Yes.

135
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,260
No hanky-panky?

136
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,860
- Don't pretend.
- No

137
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,340
You are here as a family.

138
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,300
Give me your phone.

139
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,340
You give me yours.

140
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,460
Look into all his social
network accounts tonight.

141
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,700
You do the same
with her phone.

142
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,380
For what?

143
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,700
Isn't your love true?
Be brave and give her the phone.

144
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,620
No...

145
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,180
Are you expecting
a call from some other girl?

146
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,020
Nothing like that.

147
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,900
If you're both still in
love in the morning,

148
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,940
I'll get you both married.

149
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,300
What have you done?

150
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,380
They'll breakup tonight.

151
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,260
That phone will take care of it.

152
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,900
If we'd got them together,
we'd get just two votes.

153
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,980
Now I can count on
both families' votes.

154
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,900
Super!

155
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,940
The baby has been crying for long.
Step forward.

156
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,060
Should I name the baby?

157
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,420
I'll give her the name
of a brave Tamil girl.

158
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,140
Julie

159
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,220
- That's a boy.
- What?

160
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,900
We've named him Arav already.

161
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,820
Is it?

162
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,140
Here, Arav.
Take this.

163
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,020
Then, what is it?

164
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,340
I need his birth certificate

165
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,860
but the Tahsildar wants
a signature from you.

166
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,820
I'll call him right away.
You've just had a baby...

167
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,380
Hello!

168
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,780
She's been running around in circles.

169
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,500
And you've asked for
a letter from me.

170
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,420
You've instructed me to send any
applicant from your Ward to you first.

171
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,940
I only said I'll come in person
to sort out their problems.

172
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,580
I guess you have an audience.

173
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,580
Please take care of it.
Don't waste their time.

174
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,820
- Okay!
- Super!

175
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,940
Take the petitions.

176
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,500
Come on Friday.

177
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,140
That Corporation job?
I'll get it done.

178
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,820
I have to attend the Minister's function.
I'll take leave now.

179
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,020
Look at the condition of the roads
in the CM's constituency.

180
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,100
As if the CM's and
PM's travel by road.

181
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,700
They use only helicopters.

182
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,220
Long live the Minister!

183
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,500
Who is the contractor?
He seems to be very corrupt.

184
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,700
He is your relative.

185
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,180
He's been the contractor all along.

186
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,820
These people are reckless.
They stage protests and spoil the roads.

187
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,340
Yes!

188
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,340
How are you, professor?

189
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,500
I'm doing fine.

190
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,500
Is the next batch ready?

191
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,340
As if I won't tell you when it's ready.

192
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,860
Long live!

193
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,580
Hello, sir.

194
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,380
What are you guys up to?
Are you enrolling college students now?

195
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,380
He is Azhagu's son
and is the Ward 6 Councillor.

196
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,660
Is it?

197
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,060
I am so happy to have met you.

198
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,540
- Are you going on a pilgrimage?
- No.

199
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,580
Wearing black to please atheists
and red for the believers.

200
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,300
We need both their votes.
Don't we?

201
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,180
Over enthusiastic!

202
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,460
Welcome.

203
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,980
Thanks to Ramaraj Pandian
who is responsible for this new road.

204
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,700
I personally made about 30 trips,
fought and got approval for this to happen...

205
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,940
I've already
given 30 per cent to the Minister.

206
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,060
You shouldn't be asking.

207
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,660
Out of the seven roads you are laying,
three are in our Ward.

208
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,380
I don't care
about what you've given the others.

209
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,020
Give 1 per cent to us.
Be fair.

210
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,980
Don't you understand?
Stop talking to me in public.

211
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,780
Everyone is looking at us.
Please leave.

212
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,940
That...

213
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,100
Just the way we've connected
these seven streets,

214
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,900
we will soon lay a 7-lane
road from Lalgudi to Luz.

215
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,180
He's laying the way for his relatives
to make more money.

216
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,580
Thank you.

217
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,140
Greetings, Ganesh brother

218
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,460
A few of them have come asking
for a job in the Corporation.

219
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,580
Aren't they coming on Friday?

220
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,540
We can make money.

221
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,260
We can't take money
from these people or from the public.

222
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,860
They'll curse us our whole life.

223
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,580
I agree.

224
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,820
But if we help out,
he will turn into our brand ambassador.

225
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,860
He will be there for us
when we need him.

226
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,180
- Kaveri sister?
- He is coming

227
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,780
There is no water supply
for the houses in our row.

228
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,860
I'll send Arumugam to fix it.

229
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,220
There is no water in your house
and you are playing cricket.

230
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,100
Stop the game.

231
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,460
If they stop playing cricket,
will they get water?

232
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,100
Continue playing.

233
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,780
I'll take leave.

234
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
That contractor insulted me in public.

235
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,140
We should make a name in our Ward.

236
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,580
I am irritated the
Minister is taking credit.

237
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,900
Sir, come
You go, sit down sir

238
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,420
Hi!

239
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,500
Hello, LKG.

240
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,620
Hi, da!

241
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,300
- What is your name?
- R.Sanjay

242
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,580
Sanjay Ramasamy

243
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,780
How can I help you, sir?

244
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,340
I have to put him in school.

245
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,780
- Government pre-school?
- Does he look like a pre-schooler?

246
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,740
He doesn't look like a student
in the first place.

247
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,460
Sorry...sorry

248
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,020
- Which class are you in?
- Class 7.

249
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,220
Uncle, write a letter
addressed to the High School.

250
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,660
Not the High School.
I meant Oxford school.

251
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,100
You want freebies from the government.
But you don't want government schools?

252
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,980
Even the well-off
took the government's cash gift for Pongal.

253
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,540
Not possible.
Have to apply when your wife's pregnant.

254
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,820
Yes. I need that too.

255
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,620
Where do you work?

256
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,700
I work overseas.

257
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,940
I understand.

258
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
An unplanned pregnancy?

259
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,780
Don't be embarrassed.

260
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,420
- Congratulations
- Thank you

261
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,420
- What do you want to become?
- A doctor.

262
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,900
Don't worry.
I'll handle this.

263
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,140
You can leave.
I'll see you in school.

264
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:33,860
Bye

265
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,180
What are you up to?

266
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,820
Three votes.

267
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,020
No, four votes.

268
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,820
I told your husband
to register when you're pregnant.

269
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,140
- How many weeks pregnant are you?
- Eight months.

270
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,300
Did you hear that?

271
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,460
How many weeks pregnant
is your wife?

272
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,220
We just got engaged.

273
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,060
She says she'll marry me only
if I block admission here.

274
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,740
Training for the NEET exam
begins from Class 6.

275
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,260
- Which class are you in?
- Class 7.

276
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,420
You are late already.

277
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,540
Good morning, teacher

278
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,740
I'm not teacher

279
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,180
I'm the principal of this school

280
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,140
Oh!

281
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,420
Is this our Rajappa's school?

282
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,420
My father and yours are friends.

283
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,220
I was supposed
to study in your college.

284
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,300
Unfortunately I couldn't.

285
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,100
- Who are you?
- I'm LKG.

286
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,460
Councillor, Ward 6.

287
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,620
You would
have seen me in the posters.

288
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,820
Why are you here?

289
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,660
She is from my neighbourhood.

290
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,980
She is like my sister.

291
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,020
She has two children.

292
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,820
The first one
needs to join Class 7.

293
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,100
The second one
is still in the womb.

294
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,420
I know
I have to block a seat right away.

295
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,980
It'll be great
if you can give them admission.

296
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,460
It's not that easy.

297
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,740
Didn't you see the queue outside?

298
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,820
That's just
to procure the application form.

299
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,620
Those shortlisted will be called.

300
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,500
You can't dismiss us like that.

301
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,660
She is from my neighbourhood.

302
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,740
She is pregnant.
How can she stand in the queue?

303
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,380
That's why I'm here.

304
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,860
Take a look at this.

305
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,420
It's a recommendation letter
from a Judge of the High Court.

306
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,180
Last week I got a call on my private number
from the Chief Minister's Office.

307
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,100
I haven't even considered that yet.

308
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,860
You are after all a Councillor
and you think I'll just hand it to you.

309
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,180
Please leave.

310
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,180
Okay!

311
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,460
Thank you, madam!

312
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,700
Thank you!

313
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,460
Key...

314
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,620
I've wanted to ask.

315
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,140
When did your father pass away?

316
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,020
Nonscene

317
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,620
He is very much alive.

318
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,980
Sorry!

319
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,180
I've spoken to them.

320
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,900
Admission will take a week.

321
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,300
- What are you going to become?
- Engineer.

322
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,060
We haven't made
a paisa out of this road contract.

323
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,540
We could've made at least 2 lakhs.

324
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,900
Instead, you took up social service
to gain two votes.

325
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,980
And now,
you're making a fuss about trivial things.

326
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,260
I am seeing
shades of your father in you.

327
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,140
No

328
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,900
What's the problem?

329
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,140
They've just done
the spadework for the road.

330
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,700
There is so much more to do
for the road to be ready.

331
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,780
I know what has to be done.
You eat.

332
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,740
- Why are you...?
- I'll eat

333
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,700
I just hit the stump once.
It's gone right in.

334
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,500
Contractor, come and see the magic
for yourself.

335
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,020
You fellows are hitting it real hard.

336
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,380
Arokiam sir, why don't you join?

337
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,500
Come on!
Do you want to see magic?

338
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,900
Awesome!

339
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,820
Can Arokiam hit it?

340
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,220
He has...

341
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,740
He seems to have arms of steel.

342
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,660
What protects Contractor Arokiam?

343
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:15,340
The RTI (Right to Information)
keeps Arokiam safe.

344
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,060
RTI and Arokiam are synonymous.

345
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,540
Arokiam sir, do you want to know
how the stump went in easily?

346
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,900
You keep filing RTI
petitions for everything.

347
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,540
Why don't you file one
to learn the thickness of this road?

348
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,220
How thick is it?

349
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,100
It is 2 inches.

350
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,380
No. It is 4 inches.

351
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,340
Correct answer

352
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,260
Uncle, can I have the RTI document?

353
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,380
The thickness of
the sanctioned road is 8 inches.

354
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,460
Sister, why are you taking a video?

355
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,180
I am not.

356
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,540
Then take a video of this now.

357
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,020
Are you are making a scene
because you are the Councillor.

358
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,620
Good initiatives
stall because of people like you.

359
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,420
Do you mean
the 5-lane road from Lalgudi to Luz?

360
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,260
We have three roads already.

361
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,700
We are unable to manage one wife.
Why more?

362
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,980
Why are you talking out of context now?

363
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,020
This project
was inaugurated by the Minister.

364
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,020
- You deal with him.
- Sir, why do you call...?

365
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,060
You had so much to tell me.
Say it to him now.

366
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,180
Why do you have to
involve the Minister in this?

367
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,460
Sir, phone

368
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,100
(Song from Velailla Pattadhari)

369
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,540
Hello!

370
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,260
Sir!

371
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,980
Who?

372
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,940
This is about
the road we laid in Lalgudi.

373
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,260
- There is a small problem.
- Who is that?

374
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,460
He is your party Councillor.
Please talk to him.

375
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,620
- Why do this...
-Talk to him.

376
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,700
Sir!

377
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,380
What is the problem?

378
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,420
Instead of the sanctioned 8 inch thickness
they are laying only 4 inches now.

379
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,020
You should be happy
they are laying a road.

380
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,540
He is my relative.

381
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,700
People won't know the difference.

382
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,460
Sir, I can't hear you.

383
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,980
I said,
people won't know the difference.

384
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,220
Sir, repeat it

385
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,620
People won't know the difference.

386
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,780
Sir, you are on speaker phone
and there are people here.

387
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,740
They can hear everything.

388
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,660
Hang on.

389
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,460
The Opposition thinks
people won't know the difference.

390
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,500
But the ruling party
wants people to have all the information.

391
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,700
Hand the phone to the contractor.

392
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,180
Yes. I'll give it to him.
Talk to him.

393
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,620
Sir...!

394
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,820
I heard
you are laying only 4 inches.

395
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,820
No, sir.

396
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,020
Listen to that boy.
Else, I will terminate the contract.

397
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,660
Ok, sir.

398
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,460
Yay! They are going to
lay an 8 inch thick road.

399
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,060
Sir, can I talk to you in private?

400
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,260
I can't hear you.

401
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,260
Sir, can I talk to you in private?

402
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,100
Stop talking to me in public.

403
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,660
Arokiam, our boys
will take it from here.

404
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,340
They'll ensure
that an 8 inch road is laid.

405
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,540
Talk to him and get a date for the Minister
to inaugurate the road.

406
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,140
The Minister merely started the process.

407
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
You did everything.

408
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,620
You should do everything henceforth.

409
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,700
How can I doing it?

410
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,660
Yes, you should.

411
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,580
What are all saying?

412
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,420
It's everyone's wish.
Say yes.

413
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,220
Definitely.

414
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,700
"This is our man, LKG"

415
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,580
I'm furious.
We haven't made a paisa.

416
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,300
You are ignoring my question.

417
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,420
Why should you
worry about the thickness of the road?

418
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,660
- Uncle, bring the bag from the bike.
- What?

419
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,140
- I left a bag in the bike.
- A bag?

420
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,500
Money.

421
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,420
You were with me all the while.
How did you do this?

422
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,140
A politician
should only be seen giving, not taking.

423
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,900
Son!

424
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,140
What's the thickness of the road?

425
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,020
How many?

426
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,180
It's 5 inches.

427
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,740
What if someone finds out?

428
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,860
A 6-inch ruler is enough to find out.

429
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,580
But these fellows won't.

430
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,660
- Who sanctioned the road?
- The Minister.

431
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,900
But, who are they inviting
to inaugurate the road?

432
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,500
You.

433
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,220
- So whose name will they remember?
- Yours.

434
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,540
That's 600 votes.

435
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,900
Five per cent commission.

436
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,180
Keep the money safe.

437
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,900
I'll take care of
the school admission.

438
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,260
You just won 600 votes.

439
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,380
Why bother about two votes?

440
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,500
Some have lost even with one vote.

441
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,940
Soldiers!

442
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,980
The garbage hasn't been removed.

443
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,340
Hey! Stop.

444
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,060
Why are you going away?

445
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,580
Not Sekkizhar he is Kambar

446
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,900
We're not getting water
in the toilet.

447
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,980
I am worried you don't get Tamil.

448
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,340
And now there is no water.

449
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,860
Wear your pants and sit down.

450
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,620
Sir, I feel hot.

451
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,660
The fans haven't been working
from morning.

452
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,540
We studied under the street lights.

453
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,060
Stop whining.

454
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,940
Sit down

455
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,220
You need fan?

456
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,500
Ramaswamy, what the hell is this?

457
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,140
Drainage block, madam.

458
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,500
What happened?

459
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,620
I haven't used the toilet the whole day.
I have a stomach ache.

460
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,860
Didn't you take Rs 3 lakh from us?

461
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,660
This is not a government school.

462
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,260
You could have
got someone to clean up.

463
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,060
We've lodged a complaint.
They are on the way.

464
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,980
 Please be patient.

465
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,060
Watch this atrocity.

466
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,780
We are on Facebook live.
Everyone is watching this.

467
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,460
We want the principal's response.

468
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,740
Instead the security guard answers.

469
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,020
This is atrocious!

470
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,660
Don't mistake
this for the Black Sea.

471
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,020
This is a sea of sewage.

472
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,100
Stop the video.

473
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,980
Everything will be back to normal
by this evening.

474
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,460
It will be cleared tomorrow.

475
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,940
Please disperse.

476
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,180
The principal promises that everything
will be back to normal by tomorrow.

477
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,180
Will it be a better day
for the students tomorrow?

478
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,980
Let us wait and watch on Facebook.

479
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,300
I'm Sukumaran reporting on Facebook.

480
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,780
I've spoken to the Commissioner,
the Minister and all concerned.

481
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,900
Who else should I talk to?

482
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,860
No one helped.

483
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,620
No one responded.

484
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,740
What do you mean?

485
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,460
Useless

486
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,020
There is no electricity, no water.

487
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,340
Should I manage that as well?

488
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,820
Get me a broomstick.
I'll sweep too.

489
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,900
That's one thing I haven't done so far.

490
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,700
- What the hell are you all doing?
- We've made arrangements.

491
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,540
What the hell did you arrange?

492
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,380
Don't get worked up, madam.

493
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,900
I know someone who can get all this done
with a snap of his fingers.

494
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,300
I heard our leader is not well.

495
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:48,940
He will be fine.

496
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,860
Don't say a word.

497
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,340
I need him for...

498
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,260
This is the house.

499
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,140
Come and sit here.

500
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,980
You get up.

501
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,980
Hello!

502
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,620
Hello, teacher.
How are you?

503
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,780
She is the principal.

504
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,780
We started off as teachers,
didn't we?

505
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,020
All of you are teachers?

506
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,060
Bring a few chairs to sit.

507
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
How many?

508
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,740
How many?
You have to tell me that.

509
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,460
How about two?

510
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,140
How about four?

511
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,900
Did you watch the Facebook video Sukumar
has shared about the school?

512
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,780
 I did.

513
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,580
Wasn't it good?

514
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,660
Let's not discuss that.

515
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,980
Five seats.

516
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,540
Five sit?

517
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,900
Please bring five chairs.

518
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,420
Okay!

519
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,540
How can I help you?

520
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,620
I'm unable to handle
the problems at school.

521
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,740
It will be nice if you could help.

522
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,180
Everything will be fixed
by tomorrow morning.

523
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,540
Don't worry.

524
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,140
See you.

525
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:46,220
Organise a function with
the children tomorrow.

526
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,060
Invite the parents as well.

527
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,540
Make sure it's a grand event.

528
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,620
Is 8.30 am ok with you?

529
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,340
How can we organise this
at such short notice?

530
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,940
The way you send last minute
reminders to parents...

531
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,700
...when they default paying fees.

532
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,580
- Are you in charge of flag hoisting?
- Yes

533
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,060
Hoist a flag tomorrow.

534
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,860
I'll be there in the morning.

535
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
See you.

536
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,460
- We take leave
- Come

537
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,420
There was heaps of garbage yesterday.

538
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:26,180
It has been swept clean by
a team led by LKG himself.

539
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,980
This place looks as clean as
Singapore now.

540
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,660
This man is awesome

541
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:40,140
"How long will they cheat in this
country? In our country..."

542
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,420
"For how long, will they cheat
in this country?"

543
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,300
"In their own country...
In our country..."

544
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,380
"For how long, will they cheat
in this country?"

545
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,900
"In their own country...
In our country..."

546
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:03,260
"They act like truthful great men."

547
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,660
"They act like truthful great men."

548
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,060
"At the right time, they are looting
in many ways."

549
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,380
"At the right time, they are looting
in many ways."

550
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:29,460
"By acting like devotee,
they trap the common people."

551
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:35,180
"How long...for how long..."

552
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,460
"How long will they cheat in this
country?"

553
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,380
"In their own country...
In our country..."

554
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,340
Nonsense

555
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,740
"There is bravery only in talk.
What they do is only bargain."

556
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,620
"Giving promises is usual.
Forgetting that is their habit."

557
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:13,660
"They'll fall on anybody's feet.
After that they'll even topple that person."

558
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:19,620
"They'll fall on anybody's feet.
After that they'll even topple that person."

559
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:25,620
"How long...for how long..."

560
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,900
"How long will they cheat
in this country?"

561
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,580
"In their own country...
In our country..."

562
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:46,420
"Country... mother land...
Country... mother land..."

563
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:52,460
"They'll give money in abundance.
They'll even hug old lady."

564
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:58,460
"Entering the hut of the poor, they'll
drink the porridge there."

565
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,300
"They'll say they are one among them.
After winning they'll ask, who are you?"

566
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,180
"They'll say they are one among them.
After winning they'll ask, who are you?"

567
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:16,300
"How long...for how long..."

568
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,260
"How long will they cheat
in this country?"

569
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,620
"In their own country...
In our country..."

570
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,100
India's senior politician and Tamil Nadu
Chief Minister Avudayappa Mudaliar...

571
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,660
...has been admitted in the hospital due
to sudden deterioration of health.

572
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,900
The people of Tamil Nadu...

573
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,100
and his party members are in shock
hearing the news.

574
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,980
The leaders and party
workers are in anguish.

575
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,660
January

576
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,500
February
March

577
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,020
April

578
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,580
May

579
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,500
June
July

580
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,860
August
September

581
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,860
I spoke to the chief doctor.

582
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,620
His condition is serious.

583
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,460
The Governor called.

584
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,540
To manage the public's anxiety,

585
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,780
he feels I should be the
one talking to the Media.

586
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,260
If our leader's ill health persists,

587
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,980
he said I should step in
as acting Chief Minister.

588
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,300
Didn't he suggest
you become the Prime Minister?

589
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,300
Last time when the Chief Minister left
for Singapore for medical treatment...

590
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,780
...who did he give the reins to?

591
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,580
From then on after becoming
a Central Minister...

592
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:03,540
...you've been involved in several
corruption cases, scams and smuggling.

593
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,500
There are several corruption
cases against you.

594
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,140
You could be arrested any minute.

595
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,780
Who is our leader's successor?
Isn't it Ramaraj Pandian?

596
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,180
He has a clean image.

597
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,260
Your man is not even an MLA now.

598
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,620
Who is the Deputy CM now?

599
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,020
Because he is not in town you dare
to speak like this?

600
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,260
I don't have to listen to all this.

601
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,540
So, what should we do now?

602
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,860
We won't accept this.

603
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,420
Sit down.

604
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,660
Who cares
about what he says.

605
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,740
Stop it.

606
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,740
Our leader's condition will worsen
if he sees this behaviour.

607
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,860
What is this, Bhojappan?

608
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,340
You are just watching the drama.

609
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,820
Go and meet the Press.

610
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,700
Where is Ramaraj Pandian?

611
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,660
He is not in town.

612
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,860
Tell him to stay away.

613
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,500
What happened to the Chief Minister?

614
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,820
It's just a routine check-up.

615
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,820
Our CM is 76 years old and has already
undergone treatment at Singapore.

616
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,100
Do you think his condition
will worsen?

617
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,620
Not at all.
He has a cold.

618
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,940
You say it's a common cold.
Why is a doctor from the US being flown in?

619
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,100
He is the Chief Minister.

620
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,420
That's why we've flown
in the best Specialist from the US.

621
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,500
Did the CM talk to you?

622
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,900
We talk daily.

623
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,860
He even jokes with the doctor.

624
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,980
Doctor, tell them about it.

625
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,580
The CM asked for the head
nurse's name.

626
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,620
She's from Andhra,
her name was 'Pencil'amma.

627
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,020
He asked the other nurses
if their names were...

628
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:23,020
'Pen'amma and 'Rubber'amma.
It was hilarious!

629
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,500
Is the CM eating food?

630
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,220
He ate Rava Uppuma.

631
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,420
What did he eat with it?

632
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,180
Sugar.

633
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,060
What? Isn't he diabetic?

634
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,140
That's what he meant.

635
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,420
Since he is diabetic he ate it plain.

636
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,140
We heard the Rava Uppuma cost Rs 1 crore.
How many tonnes was it?

637
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,220
That's enough

638
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,220
There have been several rumours
about the Chief Minister's health.

639
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:49,340
The Deputy CM Bhojappan's response
seemed to address it all, yet...

640
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,620
Do you think our leader will die?

641
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:58,380
He is 76 years old.
He has already undergone treatment abroad.

642
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,740
I won't be shocked
if he doesn't come back.

643
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,220
If that happens, what next?

644
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,220
The government will declare
a holiday for schools.

645
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,780
The party members will stay
in a resort for a week.

646
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,700
By-elections will happen in a month.

647
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,660
The party will split in six months.

648
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,980
In a year, some notorious guy
will become the leader.

649
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,860
Winston Churchill one's told

650
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,900
Politics isn't a game

651
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,700
This is serious business

652
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,620
Is this even relevant to
what we're saying?

653
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,260
Why are you chipping in?

654
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,700
Forget about the country.

655
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,860
How will it benefit us?

656
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:34,580
Ramaraj Pandian will
contest the by-election.

657
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,020
He's won it four times already.

658
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,860
Lalgudi is his stronghold.
He will win this time too.

659
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,140
There are chances he'll become the CM.

660
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,660
Meet him once to pay
your respects.

661
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,900
And you'll be the Councillor again.

662
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,100
Why don't we file our nomination
for the by-election?

663
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,020
That's a good sign.

664
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,820
Won't you shut up?

665
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,340
People are already jealous
that you are a Councillor at 29.

666
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,260
Do you remember what
the Minister said last time?

667
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,100
He said you are like
an over enthusiastic college kid.

668
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,740
It'll take you another 15 years
to be accepted as a real politician.

669
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,060
You are a kid.

670
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,900
Stop calling me a kid.
Don't you know?

671
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,460
You're the one who got me into
the party just after school.

672
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,020
Is there anything
I've not done for the party?

673
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,260
I've worked for the Youth
Wing, the Literary Committee,

674
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,060
the Student wing and what not.

675
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,940
Have I ever whiled away my time doing
what the others of my age do?

676
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:40,180
I've done every work
that was given to me.

677
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,500
You think the Councillor
post just happened?

678
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,980
Even if the party
doesn't accept my nomination...

679
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,300
...I've worked hard to win
as an independent candidate.

680
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,460
I will.

681
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,980
- Don't you know Ramaraj Pandian?
- Who cares about him?

682
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,820
He will win the election today.
After him, his brothers will.

683
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,780
Do you want me to be a Councillor...

684
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,780
and a hopeless politician
like my father all my life?

685
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,220
'Pride comes before a fall.'

686
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,660
Stop it.

687
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,340
Aren't you tired of talking?

688
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,980
Go to bed.

689
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,500
Are you ready?

690
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,900
What did I tell you last night?
And what have you done?

691
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,540
Try and understand.

692
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,580
Television is everything
in our country.

693
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,940
If they anchor a 100-episode show, people
think they can become a Chief Minister

694
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,380
It is all about Media now.

695
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,340
I've made my own plans.

696
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,900
I've spoken to the professor
about it.

697
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,020
No harm in trying this out.
Let's go.

698
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,860
Light check

699
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,580
Take the light.

700
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,620
I didn't mean it literally.

701
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,820
I meant look into the camera.

702
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,740
Okay!

703
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,740
Look here.

704
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,060
Can I wear my spectacles?

705
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,500
You think you are Director Mysskin?

706
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,700
Won't you talk without your specs?

707
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,940
Go on.

708
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,020
Hello!

709
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,140
Why are you so formal?
Say Hi.

710
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,500
The youngsters prefer that.

711
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,380
Hi!

712
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,420
Hiiii

713
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,740
Hi! That's enough

714
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,940
- Can I stick to Hello?
- Ok.

715
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,500
Greetings to the viewers
across the world...

716
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,260
- Across the world?
- Yes

717
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,580
How would you know?

718
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,020
Our coverage is just for
the neighbourhood.

719
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,700
Hello will do.

720
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,820
- Just say your name and start off.
- Ok.

721
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,220
Hopeless!

722
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,340
I'm very famous in my Ward.

723
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,140
Oh, yeah!

724
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,980
Are you as famous as Ambani
for everyone to know you?

725
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,540
I'm a celebrity here.

726
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,300
Yet, I introduce myself every
time I start the show.

727
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,380
You go ahead

728
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,060
Hello! I'm Lalgudi Karuppiah Gandhi.

729
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,860
What is this?

730
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,380
I will kick your mouth

731
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,740
Say, just you are speaking

732
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,380
I don't want to do this.
Uncle...

733
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,380
Why are you getting worked up?

734
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,580
Drink water.

735
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,020
Cameraman, can we leave?

736
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,420
We can go after the show.

737
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,700
Are you ready?

738
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,220
Sir, keep complimenting her
through the show.

739
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,900
The audience expects that.

740
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,660
I don't understand.
What did he say?

741
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,860
Say I look beautiful.

742
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,860
You look beautiful.

743
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,620
Not now,
when we go Live.

744
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,380
Action

745
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,300
Greetings to all the viewers.
I'm your Girija.

746
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,180
My special wishes to
my Facebook friends and followers.

747
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,900
Our special guest today is
the Councillor from Ward 6, Mr LKG.

748
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,660
We have a lot to discuss with him today.

749
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,860
Hello!

750
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,340
Hello!

751
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,980
- Can I talk?
- Go ahead.

752
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,460
I'm Lalgudi Karuppiah Gandhi.

753
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,660
I'm the Councillor of Ward 6.

754
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,500
I take my responsibilities seriously...

755
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,300
We have a caller on line.

756
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,100
I've written a lot more.

757
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,780
We have to speak to the caller.

758
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,700
Hello!

759
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,180
I'm Velmurugan.

760
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,980
This is LKG.

761
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,580
What is the problem you face?

762
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,380
I've been married for two years.

763
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,140
Trouble with a ration card
or a delay in a cooking gas supply?

764
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,460
No. It comes really quick.

765
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,100
Everything is quick during our reign.
What's the problem?

766
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,140
It comes quickly every day,
that's the problem.

767
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,420
Your cooking gas comes every night?

768
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,300
Yes. She is dissatisfied.

769
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,460
So, she left me behind and
went off on a holiday.

770
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,620
I think you have mistaken me
for someone else.

771
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,020
Isn't this the Late Night Show?

772
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,420
Can you please give
the phone to Vanaja?

773
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,500
I'm Girija. I think there's
a problem with the line.

774
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,340
Let's talk to the next caller.

775
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,380
I have to take this call.

776
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,700
This is a Live show.

777
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,100
Give some excuse.

778
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,500
What are you saying?

779
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,260
Let's continue the discussion with
LKG after a short break.

780
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,580
Thanks!

781
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,620
Hello, professor.

782
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,780
I've spoken to the office you enquired
about in Chennai.

783
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,220
You can meet
Ms Sarala Munuswamy.

784
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,100
Thank you.
When should I go to Chennai?

785
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,060
This is the Poll campaign management
company referred by our professor.

786
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,380
What?

787
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,060
A company that
works for election campaigns.

788
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,940
Party members work for an election.
Why a company?

789
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,220
Presidents Obama and Trump used such
companies for their campaigns.

790
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,140
They employ professionals
who work day and night to make them win.

791
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,900
We have such companies in India now.
This is one of them.

792
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,500
- Are they going to work for us?
- I'm not sure.

793
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,660
But, the professor's student seems to be
in a senior position here.

794
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,900
Bag hold in hand

795
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,140
Hello, madam

796
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,140
Sir, haw can I help?

797
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,500
I'm here to meet Ms Sarala.

798
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,980
There is no one by that name.

799
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
I have an appointment with
her today.

800
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,180
What's the full name?

801
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,420
Sarala Munuswamy

802
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,620
There is no one like that.

803
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,860
Anyway, let me check again.

804
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,580
Okay!

805
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,300
Is there anyone call Sarala in our floor?

806
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,140
I never knew it

807
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,900
- What's your name?
- LKG.

808
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,740
What?

809
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,660
LKG

810
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,180
There is a person by
name LKG to meet her.

811
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,500
You can go and meet her.

812
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,820
Okay, thank you

813
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,460
Sarala, madam

814
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,660
Sara

815
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,860
He said your name was
Sarala Munuswamy.

816
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,860
Silence

817
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,300
Sara M Samy

818
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,620
You've anglicised your name.
I am saying it the way it is.

819
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,140
The professor sent me to meet you.

820
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,020
I called you here because this meeting
is getting delayed.

821
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,980
What's your name?

822
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,140
LKG

823
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,620
An abbreviation for Lalgudi Karuppiah
Gandhi, just like Sara M Samy.

824
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,540
Short form

825
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,740
Listen to what I have to say.

826
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,820
We don't work on small campaigns.

827
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,100
Have you heard about Parliament elections?

828
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:53,740
We work on Lok Sabha polls, big
constituencies, campaigns costing crores.

829
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,460
We usually take over the party.
Our services include...

830
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:02,180
...selecting a candidate, vetting his
proposal, planning campaign trails...

831
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:11,180
...speeches, positioning, social media
management and a whole lot of other things.

832
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,700
We make all these decisions.

833
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,300
We were involved in 17 State elections
in India.

834
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,700
We have branches over
14 cities across the Globe

835
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,180
A campaign to make the Councillor
win the MLA election is too small for us.

836
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,740
I'm sure whatever you spoke
so far sounds Greek and Latin to him

837
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,260
Be a Rome(Roman)
when you are in Roman(Rome)

838
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,180
Why are you laughing?

839
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,780
I also know English

840
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,500
I want to speak in Tamil now.

841
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,660
What do you know about Councillor?

842
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,820
Did you say you'll work only
for the CM and PM?

843
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,260
When PMs and CMs come to our
constituency, we tell them what to do.

844
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,860
We guide them on where to campaign,
how to campaign, whose palms to grease...

845
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:50,180
...how to get funds, where to pay respects,
when to beat a man to pulp and so on.

846
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,860
You've worked on campaigns
worth crores.

847
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,740
Have you ever demanded money
from the winning candidate?

848
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,860
Forget about
the losing candidate...

849
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,420
Just say yes.
I'll bring the money.

850
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,420
Why are you smiling?
Is it my unkempt appearance?

851
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,700
 Are you wondering
how I can bring the money?

852
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,580
Even CMs and PMs can't take
money directly from the Treasury.

853
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,260
We local politicians can.

854
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,060
We can raise several invoices
for laying the same road.

855
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,580
We can sell acres of government land.

856
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,100
We can show inflated expenditure.

857
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,820
Nobody can question us.

858
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,060
Tell your boss, a Councillor
came with bags of...

859
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,820
...money to avail your
services and you refused.

860
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,620
Isn't it corporate philosophy to take
money from anyone who gives them money?

861
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,580
"He is our man, LKG"

862
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,300
Ghost!

863
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,860
Who are you?

864
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,900
Who are you people?

865
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,020
Are you having trouble
in your political life?

866
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,660
Yes.

867
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,820
Do you have the looks of a politician?

868
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,260
Looks of a politician?

869
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,500
Looks of a politician?

870
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,700
Yes. Every politician has
a unique look.

871
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,500
Let's go

872
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,700
Where are you taking me?

873
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,620
Let me go.

874
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,820
I want to use the toilet.

875
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,460
Allow me to use the toilet.

876
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,700
Do you have a problem with
the toilet?

877
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,900
Can you touch your nose with
your tongue?

878
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,620
Why are you talking about touching things?

879
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,180
Use the red bottle after a pee.

880
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,500
The blue one is after a poop.

881
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,460
Your toilet will be
sparkling clean.

882
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,100
Get lost.

883
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,300
I badly need to use the toilet.

884
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,380
One minute

885
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,860
Go ahead and clean toilets.

886
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,620
But stop the touching and
the rest of the nonsense.

887
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,540
Leave me

888
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,060
Let's find him a unique look.

889
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,820
This is his look as a politician.

890
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,660
Trust Analytica makes
you a complete politician.

891
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,260
Gives you 100 per cent confidence.

892
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,780
How did you agree to work
for me?

893
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,740
We told our Boss about the money
you were willing to pay.

894
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,420
He booked our tickets to get here.

895
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,620
America mono thanjo

896
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,100
Where are the pictures of my deities?

897
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,300
I believe in God.

898
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,260
You pray to your God, follow your rituals
but all inside the house.

899
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,260
When you step out, you
have to pray only to them.

900
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,420
That's rationalism.

901
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,860
Take it off.

902
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,700
This is in memory of my mother.
I will never take it off.

903
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,700
Okay, nice

904
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,100
Use this dialogue on stage often.

905
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,540
What is this?

906
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,900
PEET.
Political Eligibility and Entrance Test.

907
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,460
You have four questions to answer.

908
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,380
Let's see how well you've understood
people and politics.

909
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,580
A quiz?
I've been good at it since childhood.

910
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,500
Remove your spectacles.

911
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,020
- Why?
- Remove it.

912
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,660
Your first question.

913
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,060
As a leader, if you make a mistake,
what will you do?

914
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,540
I'll apologise.

915
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,780
No. Blame it on your admin.

916
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,340
Ok.

917
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,500
Your second question.

918
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,460
Who is this?

919
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,180
Bharatiyar.

920
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,820
It's swollen.

921
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,660
You are not keeping up with trends.

922
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,220
Your third question.

923
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,260
A cow and a man are both
in danger.

924
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,300
Whom will you save?

925
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,260
I should save the man.

926
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,220
You should save the cow

927
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,420
- Because...
- That's enough...

928
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,460
Are we done?

929
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,540
You haven't understood politics.

930
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,940
Let's find out if you at least
understand people.

931
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,980
This is your final question.

932
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,060
If you're buying people's vote,
what will they say?

933
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,300
They'll say they haven't got
the money yet.

934
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,900
You've understood people well.

935
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,500
A chocolate shower for you.

936
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:35,380
Oh! Chocolate shower?
So sweet

937
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,220
Now, select a title for yourself.

938
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,460
A title?

939
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,540
Can I pick anything I want?

940
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,140
- Top Star.
- Prashanth taken.

941
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,020
Prashanth, the review guy?

942
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,620
- Royal Star.
- Ranjith already taken.

943
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,260
- Chinna Thalapathi.
- It's Bharath

944
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,700
Everything seems to be taken.

945
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,140
Sathaga Paravai is called a troupe

946
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,820
How about Makkal Kural?

947
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,820
That's a newspaper.
But, sounds nice.

948
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,220
From now,
you are 'Makkal Kural'.

949
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,180
- Me?
- Yes

950
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,220
Makkal Kural

951
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,540
This looks like a movie location
where villains bash people.

952
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,780
These people are worse.
That's why I chose this place.

953
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,780
- The Press and Media, nice people.
- You'll see.

954
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,220
You can ask me whatever you want.

955
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,820
Your favourite sweet?

956
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,860
This is such an easy question.

957
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,060
Answer them

958
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:18,860
Kesari.

959
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,420
That's orange in colour.
Do you support Hindutva?

960
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,980
I like it because my father
makes delicious Kesari.

961
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,260
You mentioned your father.
You believe in nepotism?

962
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,500
Sons pursue their fathers'
profession in other fields,

963
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,380
why not politicians' sons?

964
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,540
So are you product of nepotism
like Alia Bhatt and Hrithik Roshan

965
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,380
Aren't they Bollywood actors?

966
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,540
How do you know that?

967
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,340
Don't we all eat Pani Puri and
watch Hindi movies?

968
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,580
So, you watch only Hindi Movies.
You don't watch Tamil movies?

969
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,100
Who doesn't watch a Tamil movie?

970
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,420
I love watching Rajini, Kamal films.

971
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,060
Are you going to leave this
party to join theirs?

972
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:49,980
Why should I?

973
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,500
If I watch their films
will I join to their party?

974
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,100
Yesterday I watch Malabar police
Do you want me to stay in Kerala?

975
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,820
So, you are not a Tamilian.
Aren't you a...?

976
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,980
I am a die-hard Tamilian.

977
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,300
A Tamilian will
never accept he is one.

978
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,780
You are not a Tamilian.

979
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,780
I am a die-hard Tamilian.

980
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,260
You keep saying you are a Tamilian.
Then, aren't you an Indian.

981
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,300
As if I am from Pakistan...

982
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,220
You are now talking about Pakistan.

983
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,740
Do you belong to the Hizbul Mujahideen?

984
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,740
Did you mean the cricketer,
Inzamam Ul Huq?

985
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,660
Were you involved in the cricket scam?

986
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,500
What questions are these?

987
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,420
How can anyone answer such questions?
How wicked!

988
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,020
They started with my favourite sweet.
Now I'm a terrorist.

989
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,900
My head is spinning.

990
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,980
Are you tense?

991
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,500
You must learn to handle this.

992
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,220
They can make people believe that
Trump is a Tamilian...

993
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,460
...and Thiruvalluvar is Taliban.

994
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,860
We ran a SWOT analysis of you
in your constituency.

995
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,540
What?

996
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,140
Strenght

997
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:35,740
Weakness

998
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,500
Opportunity

999
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,100
Threat

1000
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:41,860
Your strengths-you're extremely popular.
But only in your Ward.

1001
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:47,020
If you want to win, you have to be popular
in the whole constituency.

1002
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,620
For that you'll have to outshine
the other councillors and your seniors.

1003
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,060
Traditional methods will take time.

1004
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,700
It may not even work.

1005
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,860
We have a fast-track plan for you,

1006
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,860
The meme creators.

1007
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,380
Who needs memes and momos?

1008
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,460
Aren't they those jobless engineers
who post photos on Facebook?

1009
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,420
You are absolutely right.

1010
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,660
We were jobless and
regretted studying engineering.

1011
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,660
But now we are proud Meme engineer

1012
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:13,060
We are above class, caste and
other social barriers.

1013
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:18,740
We unify people, make them laugh, think and
show them right from wrong.

1014
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,700
Join our party.

1015
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,740
We can unite people for a cause,
can also lead them astray.

1016
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,460
We wait patiently for content...

1017
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,740
...if we don't get any,
we churn out what we have.

1018
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,740
In short, we are the opinion makers.

1019
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,860
We are the obeying makers

1020
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,300
- Who are we?
- We are the Meme engineer

1021
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,820
- I can't hear you.
- Meme engineer

1022
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,540
Ready

1023
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,500
Sir! Oh, beloved sir!

1024
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,460
We are in agony and pain.

1025
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,020
A fire is raging deep within.

1026
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,780
Like an anchor you've been.

1027
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,260
The most spirited captain
we've seen.

1028
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,380
Our protector you've been.

1029
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,380
Sir! Oh, beloved sir!

1030
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,380
We are in agony and pain.

1031
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,740
Our eyes are filled with tears.
Your talk is like music to our ears.

1032
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:05,380
If you leave us and go,
to Tamil Nadu we will say a big no.

1033
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,020
Sir! Oh, beloved sir.

1034
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,300
We are in agony and pain.

1035
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,740
This will definitely go viral.

1036
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,660
You will even get film offers.

1037
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,620
The whole country is plagued
with problems.

1038
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,740
We are not talking about any
of that.

1039
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,580
This is so useless.

1040
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,980
How can this become popular?

1041
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,100
Stupid

1042
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,140
Other videos have gone viral
even when we had the same problems.

1043
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,140
This will do for them.

1044
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,340
Sir! Oh, beloved sir.

1045
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,860
We are in agony and pain.

1046
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,940
Are you watching that silly video?

1047
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,340
I heard the guy recited this
and committed suicide.

1048
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,260
Really?

1049
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,860
They're going to
post that video next.

1050
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,140
Share it.

1051
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,340
What is it?

1052
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,180
I'm watching the video of
a poem recital.

1053
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:51,020
If you leave us and go,
to Tamil Nadu we will say a big no.

1054
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,140
Mum, I want to watch that video.

1055
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,100
How many times will you
watch it? Eat now.

1056
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,900
Aren't you a television actor?

1057
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,820
It was his video that we did
a Dubsmash of.

1058
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,300
- Can I take a selfie?
- Sure.

1059
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,380
Thank you

1060
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,820
Oh God!

1061
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,100
- Your poem was superb.
- Thank you.

1062
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,060
Brilliant work.

1063
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,740
Sir, do you now understand
what people want?

1064
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,180
The truth is no one knows who you are
and why you became famous.

1065
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,100
But, they know your face now.

1066
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,020
We have to make them want to see you
again and again.

1067
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,060
We've to do something for that.

1068
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,660
Shall I stage a protest?
That's the easiest thing to do.

1069
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,300
Nice

1070
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,340
What is nice about it?

1071
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,460
The country is in sorrow.

1072
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,940
Our leader is not keeping well.

1073
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:42,220
We're the ruling party,
who are you going to protest against?

1074
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,020
Against the hospital for not providing
proper medical care for our leader.

1075
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,740
Your leader holds a 40 per cent
share in that hospital.

1076
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,340
He will kick you out of the party.

1077
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,700
How about against
the American doctor's medical treatment?

1078
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:57,500
What if he leaves because of that and
our leader's condition worsens?

1079
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,100
Who'll be held responsible then?

1080
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,380
Shall I protest against the disease
that's affected our leader?

1081
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,420
That's a superb idea.

1082
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,900
When someone's sick,
we only pray for their recovery.

1083
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,580
Why should we protest?

1084
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,140
I don't understand this.

1085
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,980
You don't understand?
Perfect.

1086
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,540
No one should understand anything.
But the protest must go on.

1087
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,300
Is it all right to do this?
Who'll support us?

1088
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,900
If they don't support us,
we'll label them anti-Indian.

1089
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:28,260
Run away, you wretched disease.
We'll fight till you cease.

1090
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,740
Join us.

1091
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,220
That girl is stupid
and you're listening to her?

1092
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,820
Are you crazy?

1093
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,420
Run away, you wretched disease.
We'll fight till you cease.

1094
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,340
A protest against Disease.

1095
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,500
Is this the latest fad?

1096
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,820
This is a hospital zone.

1097
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,380
I'll give you 5 minutes.

1098
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,300
Take all the banners and
get out of here.

1099
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,660
Do you understand?

1100
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,660
I can become famous now.

1101
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,660
Here they come - to blow
things out of proportion.

1102
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:59,060
Run away, you wretched disease.
We'll fight till you cease.

1103
00:51:59,100 --> 00:51:59,740
Greetings!

1104
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,620
You're protesting against
something that we can't see.

1105
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,700
What's the logic?

1106
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,580
Can you see corruption?

1107
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,020
Is bribing visible?

1108
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,060
You support protests
against those invisible problems.

1109
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,660
Like that people must support this protest
against disease because...

1110
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,380
...this protest is for the people.

1111
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,460
This is so stupid.

1112
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,220
Will anyone protest against disease?
It's just a publicity gimmick.

1113
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,820
Thala is mass

1114
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,700
A protest against disease?

1115
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,420
I think the CM is already dead.

1116
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,060
This protest is just pretence
to distract people.

1117
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,380
Disease.. disease.. go away
Don't come another day

1118
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,980
Do something his trend video

1119
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,140
The protest has to go viral.

1120
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,660
You think you can eradicate
diseases by protesting?

1121
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,060
People run marathons to fight
AIDS and Cancer.

1122
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,540
Will Cancer or AIDS go away?

1123
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,820
This protest is just like that,
it creates awareness.

1124
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,660
LKG's protest against disease has caused
a stir in Tamil Nadu.

1125
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,980
Swallowing medicines will cure diseases.
Why protest?

1126
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,260
Swallow medicines?

1127
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,820
Blood sugar levels considered
normal a few years back

1128
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,180
Is now considered high.

1129
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,300
What spiked the levels?

1130
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,300
It's the medicines we take in.

1131
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,060
What's wrong in raising these questions?

1132
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,100
We have Bird flu and Swine flu now.

1133
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,260
Where were these diseases
20 years back?

1134
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,700
They are discovering new diseases
to sell their medicines.

1135
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,460
This protest questions this.
I totally support it.

1136
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,700
When we ate local food,
we didn't suffer from any disease.

1137
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:17,060
We've become sick only after pizzas
and burgers came in.

1138
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,380
How do we get more channels
to debate on this?

1139
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,860
There is huge spike among young voters
We need to target them for this protest

1140
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:32,900
We will keep protesting till
we eradicate disease.

1141
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,780
What is this protest for?

1142
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,700
It is to claim our disputed territory?

1143
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:43,180
This protest that started small has made
a big impact in Tamil Nadu.

1144
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:49,620
The people of Tamil Nadu and student groups
are gradually joining this protest.

1145
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:59,540
People across the world
are giving overwhelming support...

1146
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,460
...for LKG's protest
against disease.

1147
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,220
We support LKG

1148
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,220
We support LKG

1149
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,340
Further to that, Hollywood actors
are organising a protest in California....

1150
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,140
...under the leadership
of their association...

1151
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,500
head, Actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger.

1152
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:26,460
Singer Justin Bieber has tweeted his
support for LKG's protest.

1153
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,140
The state of Tamil Nadu
protest against so weird

1154
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,940
What do you believe Ladies and Gentleman?

1155
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,380
They are protesting against the disease

1156
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:37,260
And the man behind this protest is...

1157
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,620
His name is LKG

1158
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,540
Lalgudi Karuppiah Gandhi

1159
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:45,260
Your name is Gandhi,
but you are from Chennai.

1160
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,140
If I ask you these questions in Tamil,
will you understand?

1161
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:51,100
- Aren't you clueless?
- So, why speak to me in Hindi?

1162
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,180
Okay...okay!
Let's not deviate

1163
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,340
You say your name is Gandhi

1164
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,540
But your is Madras

1165
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,500
How come?

1166
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,380
Gandhi is father of India

1167
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,940
Not father of North India

1168
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,580
We are also Indians

1169
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,620
But you Tamil people are little wired

1170
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,780
Why is that?

1171
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,500
I want ask one thing

1172
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,620
When cricket player Aswin
take 10 wicket, 100 wicket

1173
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:13,300
All media saying
Indian cricket player Aswin super

1174
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,820
Very good champion

1175
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,460
Not Tamil Nadu cricket player

1176
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,620
But our fisher man getting killed

1177
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,300
You don't say Indian fisher man

1178
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,780
You say Tamil fisher man

1179
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,940
Why?

1180
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,780
Wait! I think that's good point

1181
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,700
What will we do is?

1182
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,020
We will take a break

1183
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,140
What is he up to?

1184
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,300
He's gone all the way
to Delhi with his tall talk.

1185
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,900
Tell him to meet me.

1186
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,900
Wow! Is that Pakistan on
the other side?

1187
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,420
That's Japan.

1188
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,100
One photo please.

1189
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,700
- Shall we take one?
- Yes.

1190
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,820
Stand here.

1191
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,580
Focus here. Smile.

1192
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,940
I'm going to keep this photo.

1193
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,260
I have a thought.

1194
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,220
You've brought me this far.

1195
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,020
If we get married,
won't you get me into Parliament?

1196
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:15,340
I don't have to marry you for that.
Another contract will do.

1197
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:19,060
You are my 13th client.
Can I marry everyone?

1198
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,220
I know your answer.

1199
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,380
Give me any excuse but that.

1200
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,340
I can.
But, you'll get upset.

1201
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,580
- Are you ok with that?
- I'm not.

1202
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,980
Take your position.

1203
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:32,740
"Don't act arrogant.
Hey, don't act arrogant."

1204
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,940
Sir, what about the photo?

1205
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:34,860
I don't want one.

1206
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:39,860
"Don't show arrogance. Don't show
arrogance, don't show arrogance."

1207
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:48,980
"Without doing any campaign, you
got my vote."

1208
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:58,820
"Even in public meeting I'll say that,
our coalition won't work out."

1209
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:03,900
"Don't get beaten.
There is no heart here."

1210
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:08,740
"Don't get treaded.
There is no heart here."

1211
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:13,700
"Mind doesn't know what you'll get."

1212
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,140
"Ordinary looking men's
pain is not known."

1213
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:23,540
"You are smart. I am a waste."

1214
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,860
"Let it be like that."

1215
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:33,140
"You are beautiful and I am ugly."

1216
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:36,900
"It is okay, there is no problem."

1217
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:42,220
"Don't act arrogant.
Hey, don't act arrogant."

1218
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,860
"You are confusing my mind. You are
jingling my heart. No need for love."

1219
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:51,900
"Don't act arrogant.
Hey, don't act arrogant."

1220
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:56,700
"I am a Gandhi, who doesn't like
girls much."

1221
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,500
Okay, I will come

1222
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,340
Thank you

1223
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,020
Our plan has worked out

1224
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,300
- They are calling
- For what?

1225
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,580
Bhojappan wants to meet me

1226
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,860
Thank God! If you said yes,
my total focus will be on you

1227
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,100
I will buy the property on you
after I become an MLA

1228
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,660
Now I will keep all the property myself

1229
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,580
Protest against disease.

1230
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:21,660
And a silly ode to our leader
before that.

1231
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,940
Our leader has spoken to me!

1232
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,860
Thank you so much.
I'm so happy you spoke to me.

1233
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,940
Enough!

1234
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,660
Where did you buy the ornaments?

1235
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,540
In that video it was our
leader's image on the ornaments...

1236
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:39,340
...and now ones with my image.

1237
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,940
You are named after Gandhi.
But the things that you do...

1238
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,180
You'll go a long way.

1239
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,540
Our leader called me by name.

1240
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,700
Your name is Gandhi.

1241
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,220
You are not named after
actor Shivaji, are you?

1242
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,300
Don't you understand my question?

1243
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,340
Go out.

1244
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,180
Okay!

1245
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,700
I did the same things when
I met our leader 37 years back.

1246
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:04,500
I fell at his feet immediately.
You still haven't.

1247
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,060
I'm so sorry.
It didn't strike me.

1248
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,340
Careful.
I've had a leg surgery.

1249
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,340
Leave

1250
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,740
What do you want now?

1251
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,180
Your love is all I want.

1252
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,620
Did love take you all the way
to Delhi?

1253
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,380
You'll get just one chance
in a lifetime.

1254
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,140
Tell me.

1255
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:22,060
I know someone
who was Councillor at 25...

1256
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,700
...an MLA at 31, a Minister at 36...

1257
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,780
...and Deputy Chief Minister
when he turned 52.

1258
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:31,980
There are several corruption charges
against him.

1259
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,660
But, the whole of Tamil Nadu knows
that he is the next CM.

1260
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,180
I want to become like him.

1261
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,740
That's far-sighted vision.

1262
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,940
The Chief Minister isn't too well.

1263
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,740
If he doesn't come back,
we'll have a by-election.

1264
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,780
Ramaraj Pandian will be a candidate.

1265
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,420
We don't get along.

1266
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:49,940
If you somehow catch my attention,
you'll get a chance to contest.

1267
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,860
Isn't that your plan?

1268
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,020
I didn't have a choice.

1269
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,700
People get posts only
when they get old.

1270
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,180
I can't wait that long.

1271
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,420
I just wanted to meet you
once and explain ...

1272
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:03,340
Sir, just got a call
asking you to come immediately.

1273
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,060
Let's go.

1274
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:04,940
Bos...

1275
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,140
- What?
- Can I just touch you once?

1276
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,220
Go ahead.

1277
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,220
I got to touch you!

1278
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,500
So soft.

1279
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,380
India's senior politician and
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Avudayappan...

1280
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:23,380
...failed to respond to treatment
and passed away in hospital today.

1281
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,580
The people of Tamil Nadu
and his party members...

1282
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,700
are grieving the demise
of their leader.

1283
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,540
Deputy Chief Minister Bhojappan
and his supporters are heading...

1284
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,700
...to the Governor's house to take charge
as the Chief Minster.

1285
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:36,300
He is expected to take charge
in a short while.

1286
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:40,860
I, Bhojappan, do swear
in the name of God that

1287
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:44,460
 I will faithfully discharge....

1288
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:49,620
...my duties as Chief Minister
of the State of Tamil Nadu.

1289
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,060
Congratulations and best wishes
to our new CM.

1290
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:55,580
We have no idea how long
he will hold the office of the CM.

1291
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,140
I guess even he doesn't know.

1292
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,340
Ramaraj Pandian and his supporters did
not take part in the swearing-in ceremony.

1293
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,660
An emergency general body meeting
is scheduled.

1294
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,620
Ramaraj Pandian will take part in that.
We can definitely expect a twist.

1295
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,740
What does it take to
become a Chief Minister?

1296
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:09,940
Nothing.

1297
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,780
This is the first general body meeting
without our leader.

1298
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:29,380
Some people's plans to split the party
and dissolve the government will not work.

1299
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,940
There were times when
our leader's health failed.

1300
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,460
Who did he give the reins to
at those times?

1301
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,420
Party loyalists and people
of this country know...

1302
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:40,820
who was at his side when he died.

1303
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:46,100
I have to tell you a secret that only
our leader and I knew about.

1304
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:50,620
The Chief Minister asked me
to make him a promise.

1305
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,940
I took oath as CM that very night only
to keep my promise.

1306
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,860
It wasn't to grab the office.

1307
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,140
Who cares about power?
I can just walk away.

1308
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,460
I'll have to share another secret.

1309
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,260
I made our leader two promises.

1310
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:09,300
He wanted a youngster to
contest in his constituency...

1311
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:13,300
in the by-elections after his death.

1312
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:20,700
To keep that word, the person who protested
against the disease that killed our CM...

1313
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:24,020
...and brought nationwide
fame to our party,

1314
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,140
Lalgudi Karrupiah Gandhi...

1315
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:30,860
...is the youngster who will contest
in that constituency.

1316
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:33,980
"He is standing as simple and single."

1317
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,340
"He is an ant, who can lift anything."

1318
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,260
"In the gap space
he'll get his work done."

1319
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:49,140
"He is our man, LKG!"

1320
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,180
Stop it.

1321
01:02:55,420 --> 01:03:00,340
Our leader was unable to speak
during his last days. Did he say all this?

1322
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,660
You don't want Ramaraj Pandian to win.
You're giving his ticket to some guy.

1323
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,700
Don't talk nonsense as you wish

1324
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,740
Whose permission should he ask?
Are you superior than our leader?

1325
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,820
Well done

1326
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:53,580
It took him one night to
keep all his promises.

1327
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,620
Hail the CM!

1328
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:01,060
He announced a candidate
for a by-election yet to be announced.

1329
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,420
Long live the corrupt CM!

1330
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,540
As soon as our leader died,
you gained backdoor entry...

1331
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,500
...and grabbed power overnight.

1332
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:17,580
And to keep that lie,
what an act you put on!

1333
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,380
Just because I might beat
you in the by-election,

1334
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,020
you've given the constituency to him.

1335
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,540
Everyone knows this...

1336
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:30,220
Because our late leader
feared losing elsewhere...

1337
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,340
...I gave up this constituency for him.

1338
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,580
I can sleep-walk
my way to winning.

1339
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:42,700
A politician is one who wins
in the constituency given to him.

1340
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,420
But even if the party abandons you,

1341
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,460
the one who wins even as
Independent, is a Leader.

1342
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,860
I am a leader.

1343
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,820
Let me tell you this now.

1344
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,700
Lalgudi is my constituency.

1345
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,900
I will win as an independent candidate.

1346
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:57,300
And when I win, the party and
the government will be with me.

1347
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:00,620
I'll be the CM, you'll be in prison.

1348
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:07,660
'By-election'

1349
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:11,300
'Intermission'

1350
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,680
The buzz in political circles
is that...

1351
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,640
...Ramaraj Pandian will win
the elections for the fifth time in a row...

1352
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,880
...and take charge
of the Party and the State.

1353
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,560
Heard that?

1354
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:02,360
We toiled for months
for just 3 minutes of happiness.

1355
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,760
When they introduced me
as the one who brought-

1356
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,800
nationwide fame to our
Party, I felt proud.

1357
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,560
He made a sudden entry.

1358
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,280
Where was he all this while?

1359
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,240
I don't think he was in that room.

1360
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,640
Did you see him?

1361
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,800
I think he was in hiding.

1362
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,480
Are we back to square one now?

1363
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,920
We can't defeat him, can we?

1364
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:27,960
Why not?

1365
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,520
Bhojappan has promised us...

1366
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,960
...an army of 21 MLAs, 13 Ministers
and heaps of money.

1367
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,480
The biggest advantage
you have is the Party's election symbol...

1368
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,640
...that has registered
in people's minds for 40 years.

1369
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,200
Isn't this enough to make you win?

1370
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,960
Let me explain it in a way
you'll understand.

1371
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,480
The Mumbai Indians team has
Rohit Sharma and Pollard.

1372
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,200
They've won
the championship thrice.

1373
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,680
Ambani owns the team.

1374
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,680
You say it's possible for them to win.

1375
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,280
But, the person we are playing
against is Dhoni.

1376
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,480
Ramaraj Pandian is like Dhoni.

1377
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,440
The 18 villages in this constituency
look at him as their hero.

1378
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,160
The crowd that gathers
to see him is more than

1379
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,960
the crowds that throng
the village festivals.

1380
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,400
Like SPB he sings,
Like a scorpion he stings,

1381
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,560
He is the son of the soil,
His story I'll narrate, it's no toil.

1382
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,040
Men who can't tame our bull,
wear a saree.

1383
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,040
There are no men in this village.

1384
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,080
Our brother is here.

1385
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,080
(Song from 'Enga Ooru Paatukaran')

1386
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,160
Why is he singing?

1387
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,320
This is hard to believe.

1388
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,160
Wait. I haven't finished yet.

1389
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,720
This bull has brought us shame.
Kill it.

1390
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,120
Where is he?

1391
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,240
I see the moon.

1392
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,400
Go man

1393
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,600
Let's run away.

1394
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,920
Can't predict his moves!

1395
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,960
Why did you shift to reverse gear?

1396
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,640
Let's pretend we've fainted.

1397
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,000
I asked you to tell us about
Ramaraj Pandian.

1398
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,920
But you're talking about Actor Ramaraj.

1399
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,200
You find it funny?

1400
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,280
Your life is around
Facebook and Twitter.

1401
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,480
What do you know about
the world outside them?

1402
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,200
He can actually sleep-walk
his way to winning.

1403
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,600
He's worked that hard.

1404
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,920
For the last 30 years, he's been up
at 4am and toils till late night.

1405
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,920
He has risen above caste and religion
and initiated many welfare schemes.

1406
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,720
He's stayed single all along.
Women are waiting in line to marry him.

1407
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,320
It's not just women;
even men want to be around him.

1408
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,440
He is that handsome.

1409
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,200
He is a charismatic leader.

1410
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,680
That's enough.

1411
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,840
I agree with all that you said.

1412
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,400
He did all this after he won.

1413
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:42,000
But, he must have done a few things to win.
That is what we should do now.

1414
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,240
I've already signed the contract.

1415
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,520
That expired the moment
you were given the MLA ticket.

1416
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,960
This one is for you to win
the MLA election.

1417
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,840
It's a fresh contract.

1418
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,560
But, you said we were friends...

1419
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:52,680
Corporate

1420
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,400
Corporate philosophy is to take money
from anyone who gives money.

1421
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,640
You were the one who said that.

1422
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:01,280
Though it doesn't appear that way,

1423
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,040
Ramaraj Pandian's success
is because of his caste.

1424
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,520
Most people in this constituency
are the same caste as he is.

1425
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:12,520
Every time he contests, the Opposition
fields a candidate from the same caste.

1426
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,440
In the last 30 years no one from
your caste got an opportunity to contest.

1427
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,400
You are the first.

1428
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,480
That's the plus

1429
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,400
Another reason for his success is the
ritual of gifting money at all functions

1430
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:26,600
If you attend their function and gift money,
people don't care how corrupt you are.

1431
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,400
They'll vote for him till they die.

1432
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,880
For leaders to win
every time, they have-

1433
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,360
-to attend every event
of birth, death...

1434
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,840
...and marriage in the village.

1435
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,640
You are making a big deal of it.

1436
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,760
To how many of your functions
has Ramaraj Pandian come?

1437
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,600
Out of the 20 in this room,
seven of you have raised your hands.

1438
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,400
Our research says
that in the last 30 years...

1439
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:51,440
....he has attended more than 7000 weddings
and 2400 funerals.

1440
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,800
One more fun fact...

1441
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,240
About 200 to 300 votes are cast
by people who are convinced that...

1442
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,880
...if he attends their wedding,
they will have a boy.

1443
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,200
To be a good politician,
you needn't be a good person.

1444
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,240
You just have to say the right things
and they will believe you.

1445
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,120
They have talked their way
to ruling the country.

1446
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,400
I believe you have the ability
to do this.

1447
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,920
If you believe that too,
you will definitely win.

1448
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,760
Everyone laughed when I wanted
to become a Councillor at 26.

1449
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,440
I am one now.

1450
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,480
I wanted to win the ticket over
Ramaraj Pandian in the by-election.

1451
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,240
People said that's impossible.

1452
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,800
But, now I've got the seat.

1453
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,280
People are convincing me I'll lose.

1454
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,800
But, you are showing me
a way to win.

1455
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,800
Why won't I?

1456
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,680
I'll do anything to win.

1457
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,880
"Let us create one rule.
Let us win singularly."

1458
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,040
"Where is the speed breaker for victory?
Let us fight a battle."

1459
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,000
"The one who gives himself is leader.
the one who sells you is a trader."

1460
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,200
"The one who pays
to get your vote is a thief."

1461
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,400
"Initially tortoise will lose to the rabbit."

1462
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:06,160
"Finally tortoise will win the rabbit."

1463
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:10,400
"The world will mock at you,
whatever you do."

1464
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,880
"After your victory, it'll praise you."

1465
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,760
"Leader...leader...you come."

1466
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,000
"You come as sea waves without
succumbing to anyone."

1467
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,000
"Leader...leader...you come."

1468
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:30,560
"The sky is in your touching distance,
you progress and come."

1469
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,400
"Let us create one rule. Let us win
singularly."

1470
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:38,600
"Where is the speed breaker for victory?
Let us fight a battle."

1471
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:42,480
"The one who gives himself is leader.
the one who sells you is a trader."

1472
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,600
"The one who pays to get
your vote is a thief."

1473
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,360
"Falling drizzle won't go waste."

1474
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,400
"It'll turn as river and cross the border."

1475
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,520
"Insult won't put you off."

1476
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,600
"It'll turn as fire for your oblation."

1477
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:39,480
"In the blowing air birds fly."

1478
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:43,280
"Paper also flies with air."

1479
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,360
"Once the blowing air stops,
you'll know, Friend!"

1480
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,880
"The birds will fly away, but the paper
will end up in soil."

1481
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,800
"Leader...leader...you come."

1482
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,920
"You come as sea waves without
succumbing to anyone."

1483
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,920
"Leader...leader...you come."

1484
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,160
"The sky is in your touching distance,
you progress and come."

1485
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,600
"Let us create one rule.
Let us win singularly."

1486
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:23,400
"Where is the speed breaker for victory?
Let us fight a battle."

1487
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:27,480
"The one who gives himself is leader.
the one who sells you is a trader."

1488
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,480
"The one who pays to get
your vote is a thief."

1489
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,960
I've had fever for two days.

1490
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,600
You are faint-hearted.

1491
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,240
Why did you go to the funeral,
because she told you to?

1492
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,680
It's four days since
I've eaten something.

1493
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,520
My stomach is bloated because of the soda
I've been drinking.

1494
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,080
What is this on your forehead?

1495
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,920
It is my blood

1496
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,000
I thought they were wishing me well by
applying vermillion on my forehead.

1497
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,080
But they've mixed it with
spices and it hurts.

1498
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,360
What's happening?

1499
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,680
No one wants us.

1500
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,160
We belong to the ruling party,

1501
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,320
But they wave black flags even
when I go with our leader.

1502
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,800
Do something.

1503
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,240
Rohit Sharma versus Dhoni...

1504
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,440
I'll kill you.

1505
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,680
I'm the one who is not well.

1506
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,520
Why are you repeating yourself?

1507
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,520
Bhojappan said that
he will send his army of 21 MLAs...

1508
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,600
...and 13 Ministers to help
with the campaign.

1509
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,800
Please send word that
we need their help.

1510
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,960
We have a campaign meeting this evening.
Everyone has to be present.

1511
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,040
She is not in town.

1512
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,240
- You do the work.
- I'll handle things.

1513
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,320
You sleep.

1514
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,080
A warm welcome to the thousands
who've gathered here.

1515
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:15,400
Lalgudi Karuppiah Gandhi will be here
to address you all.

1516
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,800
Greet him with your applause.

1517
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,600
He will be here...

1518
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,440
He is here.

1519
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,880
Thousands who've gathered...

1520
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,080
Take him home and feed him.

1521
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,080
If there was power at home,
why would I be here?

1522
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,000
Don't play here.

1523
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,600
No one turned up because they believe
he will win and become the CM.

1524
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,800
They want to be in his
good books.

1525
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,640
Okay

1526
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,240
I understand.

1527
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,920
Leave me alone.

1528
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,920
- Listen...
- Get lost!

1529
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,480
Not tall enough?

1530
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:30,720
What?

1531
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,320
Not tall enough?

1532
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,640
Go away.

1533
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:47,360
The army of Ministers and MLAs as
promised by your leader are all here.

1534
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,640
Do a head count.

1535
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:53,120
Though Bhojappan is the Opposition,

1536
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,920
I have to agree he is smart.

1537
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,400
He managed to become
the CM even with me around.

1538
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,480
I don't know what happened now.

1539
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,800
He might have seen you on TV a few times
and decided to give you the seat.

1540
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,840
He has gone senile.

1541
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:14,080
I heard you go to every wedding
and funeral I go to.

1542
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,040
It seems you try to speak like me.

1543
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,920
You want to win somehow.

1544
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,760
You might have crores of
money, support of the-

1545
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,800
ruling party, a 40-year
old election symbol.

1546
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,360
Yet, you can't gain entry
into my fortress.

1547
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,800
I just did a headcount.
Seven of them are missing.

1548
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:36,880
Shut up.

1549
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,600
I think it was in 1967.

1550
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,720
Someone defeated Kamarajar.

1551
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,280
Do you know who defeated him?

1552
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,680
You wouldn't remember.

1553
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,200
He won, but was still an MLA.

1554
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:51,440
Even if he lost, Kamarajar
will be who he is.

1555
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,600
Is the election campaign
work on track?

1556
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,480
It's going fine.
I sent two trucks full of people yesterday.

1557
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,920
We ran out of food though.

1558
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,360
We've sent cash for everyone
in the constituency.

1559
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,160
His posters are everywhere.

1560
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,080
The campaign meeting was a success.

1561
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,080
We'll stand by him.

1562
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,160
He's already got the look of a winner.

1563
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,640
No surprise if Ramaraj Pandian
himself votes for him.

1564
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,600
- He'll definitely win...
- He is lying.

1565
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,080
Nobody did a thing.

1566
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,120
Didn't I tell you everything
over the phone?

1567
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,080
- Keep quiet.
- Mind your words.

1568
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,240
Who do you think you are?

1569
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,440
Do you know about us?
How dare you disrespect us?

1570
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,360
I'll kill you.

1571
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,240
Stop it.

1572
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,200
Sit down.

1573
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:46,640
And you...

1574
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,600
It is bad manners to talk
the way you did.

1575
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:51,640
He doesn't know basic etiquette.
And you've given him a seat.

1576
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,720
Not the candidate to pit against
Ramaraj Pandian.

1577
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,960
What do you mean?

1578
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,240
Ramaraj Pandian isn't just his enemy.

1579
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,440
He is your enemy and enemy
to our money as well.

1580
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,840
You forgot that and dared
to praise him in front of me?

1581
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,600
We're not praising him.

1582
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,520
You're the one giving him
undue importance.

1583
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,960
You should've raised
your objection in the meeting.

1584
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,600
Didn't you see
the chairs thrown around?

1585
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,560
You ignored it and gave him a seat.

1586
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,800
The seat is given.

1587
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,360
That can't be changed.
How to make him win?

1588
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,600
Let's talk about that.

1589
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,760
Nothing can be done.

1590
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,120
He can never be Ramaraj Pandian.

1591
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,080
We know he's going to win.
We can't take him on.

1592
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,200
What?

1593
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:30,160
You have the guts to support
him in front of me?

1594
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,200
What about you?

1595
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:35,000
If they arrest you
after he wins,

1596
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,520
you'll strike a deal to be
the CM or Deputy CM.

1597
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,080
Why should we work for LKG
and become his enemy?

1598
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,000
Let me tell you now.
We won't work for him.

1599
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,200
He will lose.
He won't even get his deposit back.

1600
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,240
I know how to win.

1601
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,520
I won't lose.

1602
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,720
You can't get away because
the CM is with you.

1603
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,240
I'll kill you.

1604
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,360
Stop fighting.

1605
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,520
How can I keep quiet when
they talk like this?

1606
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:00,600
I will win.

1607
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,200
Go out and wait.
I'll call you in.

1608
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,440
Just leave this place

1609
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,000
He is a young boy.
Why threaten him like this?

1610
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:07,920
Get out

1611
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,000
You should have expected this
when you gave him a seat.

1612
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,200
Get out.

1613
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,280
Leave him.

1614
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,120
Let him go.

1615
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,200
We'll take care of him later.
Get out.

1616
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:19,360
Leave now.

1617
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,840
Get lost

1618
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,400
I see shades of your father
in you these days.

1619
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,640
A sparrow, however hard it tries
can never become an eagle.

1620
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,720
I'm in a bad mood.
I'll kill you. Go away.

1621
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:20,640
A sparrow, however hard it tries
can never become an eagle...

1622
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,000
What are you doing?

1623
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,520
What if someone
shares this on Facebook?

1624
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,720
Even one of us might do it
to get Likes.

1625
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,000
Why organise a meeting
when I am not around?

1626
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,440
Don't you know no one will come?
Are you an idiot?

1627
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,640
Am I the idiot or is it the
bunch of you?

1628
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,680
You charged a fee even
before starting work.

1629
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,080
My Dad is telling...

1630
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,680
Can a sparrow become an eagle?
Don't you understand?

1631
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,040
He's taken 30 years to become this popular.
How can I do that in 30 days?

1632
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:58,120
The ideas you came up with!
Attend funerals and weddings...

1633
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,080
How many funerals can
I attend in a month?

1634
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,000
You think winning comes easy?

1635
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,840
Idiots!
Put your hands down.

1636
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,520
You need 30 years to build
a fortress.

1637
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,520
But to bring it down...

1638
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,200
Why should I suffer?

1639
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,040
I'll make him suffer.

1640
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,520
I can't rise up to his level.

1641
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,520
But I can bring him down to mine.

1642
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,040
I'll manage from now on.

1643
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,160
Greetings!

1644
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:30,800
Where are the scissors?

1645
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,840
It's with me.

1646
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,600
Please give the scissors.

1647
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,080
I will not.

1648
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,160
He needs to cut the ribbon
for the inauguration.

1649
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:43,200
We the public pay money
to buy from you.

1650
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,520
Public

1651
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,720
But you want him to do the honours.

1652
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,520
Are you crazy?

1653
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:56,720
Are you crazy or am I crazy?

1654
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:01,760
Shall I cut the ribbon?

1655
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,560
Tell me what you want.

1656
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,880
I will talk only to my leader
Ramaraj Pandian.

1657
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:08,880
I am Ramaraj Pandian.

1658
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,080
You shut up.

1659
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,760
My leader Ramaraj Pandian
will be here any moment.

1660
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,440
Get ready to face the music.

1661
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,600
All of you get ready to face the music.

1662
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:20,240
You are too drunk to know
who you are talking to.

1663
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,320
That's a wrong thing to say.

1664
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,480
You are drunk.
Go to sleep.

1665
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,760
If you are a big-shot,
shut down all the liquor shops.

1666
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:31,320
You are selling and
I will keep drinking.

1667
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:34,560
No brother! I am telling you...

1668
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:39,440
Ramaraj Pandian slapped his own party
member at a social gathering.

1669
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,160
The general public and his party members
are unhappy about the incident.

1670
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:47,880
Several leaders have condemned
his inappropriate behaviour.

1671
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,800
How dare you slap him?

1672
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:57,880
He should have slapped someone
who charges more for the liquor.

1673
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:01,400
I'm calling for a protest.
It's going to be big.

1674
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,120
Wait and watch.

1675
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,080
You slapped your own party member.

1676
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,080
What if you ill-treat
the poor after you win?

1677
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,880
If I hit you, you'll come down
like a ton of bricks.

1678
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:17,040
You said Social Media will
help build a person's image.

1679
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,120
But it seems easier to destroy
someone's image.

1680
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,040
The drunken incident is
getting good responses.

1681
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,600
Tell your meme team to put
in more hours.

1682
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,280
He is attending a programme
at a college next.

1683
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,360
Organise our team to be there.

1684
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:32,440
Ramaraj Pandian
has remained single and has...

1685
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:37,280
...dedicated his life for the upliftment
of Tamils and Tamil Nadu.

1686
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,920
We take great pride in inviting him.

1687
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:43,240
Ramaraj Pandian,
who is the personification of Tamil...

1688
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:46,720
...will inaugurate this program
by singing the Tamil invocation song.

1689
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,920
Sing what?

1690
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,200
The Tamil invocation song..

1691
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,040
- Me?
- Yes.

1692
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,120
He is asking all of you to stand up.

1693
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,400
He wants you all to be quiet.

1694
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,360
Don't you know I have a bad throat.

1695
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,880
Have this lozenge.

1696
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,720
It will soothe your throat immediately.
I saw it on TV.

1697
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,800
The mike is not working.

1698
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,400
Switch it on first.

1699
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:36,440
(Singing Tamil invocation song)

1700
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,560
You've got the lyrics wrong.

1701
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:16,040
People from other States speak in Tamil.
Why can't Ramaraj Pandian?

1702
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:19,600
"Let me turn your drape into a house,

1703
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,840
- You are speaking out of context.
- I can even sing.

1704
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,640
(Song from 'Aval varuvala')

1705
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,280
If you sing, I will start singing too.

1706
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,840
(Song from 'Muthu')

1707
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,520
If you are sing,
I'll also sing

1708
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,400
(Song from 'Suryavamsam')

1709
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,240
We will continue the debate after
a short commercial break.

1710
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,320
Ramaraj Pandian, don't you know how
to sing the Tamil invocation song.

1711
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,000
Shame on you.
Even I can sing it.

1712
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,240
Shall I?

1713
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,720
Repeat what I just told you.

1714
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,600
Repeat what I just told you.

1715
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,000
Aren't you ashamed?

1716
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,800
(Singing Tamil invocation song)

1717
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,320
Even children are making fun of him.
Is he that stupid?

1718
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,960
How can people think he is handsome
and charismatic?

1719
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:03,280
Women may want to marry him,
but why would men want to get near him?

1720
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,080
That's a bit too much.

1721
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,880
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

1722
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:12,400
What if we start a rumour that
Ramaraj Pandian is actually a woman?

1723
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,040
What do you mean?

1724
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:19,240
His colourful shirts, he hugs men,
is single. It adds up.

1725
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,120
- Super idea
- Madam

1726
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,840
You support every idea of his
and he comes up with absurd ones.

1727
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:25,400
The whole town will laugh.

1728
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,960
Yes. So?

1729
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,240
Nobody will believe you.

1730
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,400
They don't have to believe it.
But they will talk about it.

1731
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:33,440
It will trend even if it is a lie.

1732
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,560
- Get our men on the job.
- No...No

1733
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,560
We shouldn't get
involved directly.

1734
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:39,800
We should be associated only
with the good.

1735
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,960
The bad stuff should stem
from outside.

1736
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,720
We have to find someone for it.

1737
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,520
Amal Tailors at Kilpauk,
is from our village.

1738
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:51,920
He's a great tailor.

1739
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,880
I don't know how to say this.

1740
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,760
Ramaraj Pandian, a seasoned,
well-respected politician from Tamil Nadu.

1741
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,400
We've received some
shocking news about him.

1742
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:07,000
Ramaraj Pandian is a woman
and not a man.

1743
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:13,760
Sister, it is a privilege to be a woman.
I don't have to tell you that.

1744
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,800
Hats off to you if you accept
the truth.

1745
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:20,680
I give 2.75 stars for Ramaraj Pandian
the man.

1746
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:23,800
And a full 5 stars for Ramaraj Pandian
the woman.

1747
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,640
Thangamuthu, a 63-yearold
man has filed-

1748
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,800
-a petition claiming Ramaraj
Pandian is his wife.

1749
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,040
I'm 63 years old.

1750
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,760
Will anyone lie at my age?

1751
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:37,520
I married Pandima in 1984
in our village temple.

1752
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,880
Take a look at the photo.

1753
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,120
Guess the video was true.

1754
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,080
I recently saw a video
in which I realised that-

1755
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:49,520
-the well-respected Ramaraj
Pandian is my Pandima.

1756
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,360
What if she denies it?

1757
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,920
I've filed a request in court
for a DNA testing.

1758
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:58,680
Pandima, you are now a big politician.

1759
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:03,320
I've remained single from
the time you went missing.

1760
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,600
I heard you have also remained single.

1761
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,440
Will you please come back
to me as Pandima?

1762
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,680
Or should I undergo a sex change surgery?

1763
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:17,320
Let's use social media
to spread this rumour.

1764
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,360
Already done.

1765
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:23,240
Run a survey.
Show him in bad light.

1766
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:24,480
Understand?

1767
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,400
Any news about
what he plans to do next?

1768
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,520
He is meeting Actor Mukesh
to ask for his support.

1769
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,760
'Junior Revolutionary Commander'.
How are you?

1770
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,560
Pandima!

1771
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,320
Sorry. Pandi, it's been so long.

1772
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:43,280
You look so beautiful at this age.
Leave me

1773
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,360
Okay brother

1774
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,040
How is the election campaigning going on?

1775
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,600
Not doing well.

1776
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:53,360
I'm here to request
your fan club's support.

1777
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:57,160
Why ask?
It's a given.

1778
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,920
I want no interruptions for
half an hour.

1779
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,320
- Half an hour?
- Yes.

1780
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,800
Then 'Junior Revolutionary'?

1781
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,560
Which movie are you working on now?

1782
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,880
'Man or Woman'?

1783
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,640
That's the name of the movie.

1784
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:23,080
It's a beautiful subject.

1785
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:24,960
I don't have time to watch movies.

1786
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,880
I agree.

1787
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,400
I heard you slapped someone.
Why such rage?

1788
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:34,280
That's nothing.
He was a drunkard.

1789
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:38,320
I heard you refused to sing
because of a bad throat.

1790
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:41,480
You should have a concoction
of ginger and pepper...

1791
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,160
That can be organised.

1792
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,000
That is right

1793
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:48,840
You are under stress.
You are tense.

1794
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:54,040
You should practice yoga,
get a massage.

1795
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,920
- I can give you a massage myself.
- Why trouble you?

1796
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,120
That's no trouble.
It's a boon.

1797
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:00,880
Close your eyes.

1798
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,640
How do you feel?

1799
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:09,360
Massage for the eyes,
nose and lips...

1800
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,200
What the hell are you up to?

1801
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:14,160
Pandima, I know the truth about you.

1802
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,920
It was a taboo till a few years back.

1803
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:19,080
Now, it is protected by Law.

1804
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:23,640
What if they tweet about us?

1805
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,240
Idiot!

1806
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,640
Why meet actor Mukesh
at a crucial time like this?

1807
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,800
It was a regular meeting.

1808
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,480
What happened between
the two of you while you were inside?

1809
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,760
Are they suspecting anything?
No, I can't

1810
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,000
You've been close friends for long.
Will he support you politically?

1811
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,920
We're not that close.
Don't misinterpret things.

1812
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:46,520
You have announced more benefits
for women in your manifesto.

1813
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,560
Isn't that good?

1814
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,440
But a Minister has
remarked that only a woman-

1815
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,720
-can best understand
another's problems.

1816
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:54,360
I don't need to respond to
random remarks.

1817
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,640
Do you have an answer for
your husband Thangamuthu?

1818
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,440
I don't know anyone
by the name Thangamuthu.

1819
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,040
Taking the husband's name
is not in our culture.

1820
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:00,840
What did you say?

1821
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,360
He claims he has proof that
you are a woman.

1822
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:05,480
Will you undergo a DNA test
to prove you are a man?

1823
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,480
Shall I prove it now?

1824
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,960
Do you want to take a look?
Take a look.

1825
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,720
- I didn't see all of it.
- Thank God.

1826
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:14,160
I look like a woman.
But I'm a man at heart.

1827
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:17,360
- But I AM A MAN.
- I had my doubts.

1828
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,640
We Tamils respect and revere our women.

1829
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:24,360
But Ramaraj Pandian removed his dhothi
before a woman to prove he is a man.

1830
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,120
Do you want me to prove it?

1831
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:30,760
You slapped a person for
a pair of scissors? Should I?

1832
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:35,800
You ran away because
you didn't know how to sing? Should I?

1833
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:39,920
Respected chairperson,
before blaming social media

1834
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:47,520
for making Ramaraj Pandian
a laughing stock...

1835
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,080
Think for a moment.

1836
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:55,800
You didn't respect Tamilians.
You don't know Tamil.

1837
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,600
Why would they vote for you?

1838
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,800
Vote for me.

1839
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:00,960
Give me a chance.

1840
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:02,280
Just one chance.

1841
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:05,760
I swear on my family deity that
I will give fair governance.

1842
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,120
You spoke very well.

1843
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:17,200
You recalled every mistake of his
and established he is guilty.

1844
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:18,120
That's the highlight.

1845
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:20,680
Everyone now believes
he is in the wrong.

1846
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,200
Tomorrow is his last
meeting with the public.

1847
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:24,680
He will surely apologise.

1848
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,120
You missed saying something.

1849
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:28,320
You should've spoken about
what you'll do if you win.

1850
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,600
You forgot that.

1851
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,400
Our people don't go by
what good a person can do.

1852
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,680
They go by the bad the person
in power did.

1853
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:38,880
Never mind.

1854
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:40,920
You are right.

1855
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:41,960
Stop the car.

1856
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,720
I'll pass on my condolences to him.

1857
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,760
Hi, leader!

1858
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:48,800
What's the matter?

1859
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:50,880
You seem to be really down.

1860
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,200
I'll come over.

1861
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:56,640
(Song from 'Priyamaana Thozhi')

1862
01:37:58,600 --> 01:37:59,920
Is that your car?

1863
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,320
- Sweet boy
- Brother!

1864
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,640
Buy me a car.

1865
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,160
Take him away.

1866
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,320
- I'll start my own party.
- Come brother

1867
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:17,240
You won unanimously, unopposed
for the last 30 years. Aren't you bored?

1868
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,360
It would've hit you hard...

1869
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,840
...that for the first time
ever someone's challenging you.

1870
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,040
Why would you remove your
dhoti otherwise?

1871
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:27,680
You were right about Bhojappan.
He is not an idiot. He is smart.

1872
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:32,160
That's why he gave me a ticket.

1873
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:34,240
I wonder how I managed all this.

1874
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:39,480
What an army of 21 MLAs and
13 Ministers couldn't do, this phone did.

1875
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,800
Today, all we need is a phone.

1876
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,920
For the last 30 years,
they looked at you as a Hero.

1877
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,960
It is Ok if they look at you as a villain.
But, they think you are a comedian.

1878
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,320
They laugh at you.

1879
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:50,400
I'm saying this again.

1880
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,120
A great leader like Kamaraj was defeated.

1881
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,400
You can lose too.

1882
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:57,280
Don't ask me who defeated Kamaraj.
I have no answer.

1883
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:02,320
But everyone will come to know
who defeated Ramaraj Pandian.

1884
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,240
I didn't know about you.

1885
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:19,440
I just got to know that you were
behind his success.

1886
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:23,280
All I know is to meet
the people directly...

1887
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:26,000
...get the votes from my community,
preventing illegal voting and so on.

1888
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,440
This is the politics I know.

1889
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:31,400
But now it is all about Social Media.

1890
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:34,520
You say I lost 10 per cent of my votes
because I slapped a drunkard.

1891
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,440
There are people who claim I am
a woman, and some believe that.

1892
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:39,360
It took me 30 years to
build this reputation.

1893
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,320
A 30 second video destroyed it.

1894
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,480
We've only asked people for
their votes.

1895
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,760
For the first time I'm asking
a company to help me get votes.

1896
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:47,720
We are here now.
We will handle everything.

1897
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,120
You worked for him.
How can you work for us now?

1898
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:51,400
Keep quiet.

1899
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,280
Brother!

1900
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,240
I'm sorry.

1901
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,400
That's Ok.

1902
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:57,040
Corporates will work for
anyone giving money.

1903
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,640
Read the contract before signing it.

1904
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,880
The elections will get over
by the time I read this.

1905
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:02,520
Please start work.

1906
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:08,440
Tell me what I should do.

1907
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,360
The CM is LKG's biggest strength.

1908
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:13,960
Being a candidate with the CM's support
is his advantage.

1909
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:15,960
We have to oust the CM.

1910
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,360
I'm working on that.

1911
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,280
He will definitely be arrested
after the elections.

1912
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:24,280
That's too late.
What if you lose?

1913
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,280
He has to be arrested before
the elections.

1914
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,560
How can that be done?

1915
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,040
Go to Delhi.
Fall at their feet.

1916
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:33,200
Promise your support
to them if you become CM.

1917
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:36,160
Tell them you will be their puppet.
They'll agree right away.

1918
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,040
Sister

1919
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,960
Say this for now and surrender.
We'll take care of the rest later.

1920
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,840
Ramaraj Pandian has allied himself
with the Centre in Delhi.

1921
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,000
They plan to arrest me even
before the elections..

1922
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,880
I just got to know.

1923
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,440
I need you all to sign this.

1924
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:50,720
Why now?

1925
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,600
If I go to jail, I don't want
any of you to shift loyalties.

1926
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,040
Just a safety measure.

1927
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:58,960
I'll make sure you neither lose
your money nor your posts.

1928
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,400
Sign up, Kodhandam.

1929
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:01,560
Yes, sir.

1930
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:04,720
Sister, super!

1931
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,720
I promised to be loyal to the Centre and
there was a good response.

1932
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:11,080
They're talking about
arresting him on-

1933
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,720
-corruption charges, even
before the elections.

1934
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,880
- Who's saying this?
- The Governor's office.

1935
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,240
Bhojappan is shaken.

1936
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:22,120
Just that, he's collecting
everyone's signatures.

1937
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,320
That doesn't matter.

1938
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,160
Our Company has a resort at Yelagiri.

1939
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:27,680
Why go that far,
a nearby place will do.

1940
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:30,600
What next?

1941
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,760
His father is his weakness.

1942
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:44,720
I've been single for 30 years.
I've dedicated my life for your welfare.

1943
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:52,400
But you know people have been conspiring
against me for some time.

1944
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:58,040
Instead of defending myself, I have my
friend and seasoned politician...

1945
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:02,800
...Alagu Meiyappan will share
the truth with the world.

1946
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:36,720
A son's duty is to make his
father proud.

1947
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:43,520
But my son is so vicious,
full of lies.

1948
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:47,880
Even though my son
is his opponent,

1949
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:54,640
I'm here because I
stand for truth.

1950
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:58,400
If a man who has for the last
30 years fought to abolish liquor...

1951
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:02,680
...slaps a drunkard,
I am not surprised.

1952
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:06,360
If a drunkard misbehaves in our house,
will we keep quiet?

1953
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,880
Laymen like us are only
bothered about our homes.

1954
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:12,560
But for those like Ramaraj Pandian,
the nation is his home.

1955
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:15,880
If you doubt his intention,
get out of this great nation.

1956
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:19,120
If he can't sing the Tamil Invocation song,
is he not a Tamilian?

1957
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:23,080
He is not contesting in a reality show.
He is an uncontested star.

1958
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:29,360
We need a person like him to lead us out
of the current political instability.

1959
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:30,720
We don't need a coward.

1960
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:35,040
If you still think Ramaraj
Pandian is guilty,

1961
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,520
I'll ask him to
apologise right away.

1962
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,680
- Shall I ask him to?
- No.

1963
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,800
I have failed as a father.

1964
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:46,000
But as a Tamilian, I want to triumph.
That's why I've taken sides with the truth.

1965
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,160
The umbrella symbol stands for truth.

1966
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:52,480
Vote for Ramaraj Pandian and
save Tamil Nadu.

1967
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,080
She is a cutthroat.

1968
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:57,840
That's fine.
But my own father...

1969
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,960
I've been angry with you
since I was a child.

1970
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,200
You were naive, made no name,-

1971
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:24,240
-didn't earn a paisa and
didn't do a thing for me.

1972
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,600
You set it all right with this
big speech of yours.

1973
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,080
Do you hate me so much?

1974
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,000
I've had many disagreements with you.

1975
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:40,040
But I've always thought of
you as my father.

1976
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,520
You've shown me that
politics is beyond family.

1977
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:52,280
You were a loser.
Now, you have made me lose.

1978
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:59,320
The latest opinion poll indicates
that we are in the lead again.

1979
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:02,240
The buzz is that I'm the next CM.

1980
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:03,440
This won't do.

1981
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:05,640
Anything can change in two days.

1982
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,360
We have to kill his father.

1983
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,400
You are brilliant.

1984
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:14,160
If we kill him, the blame will be on him
because his dad went against him.

1985
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,480
Thank God you didn't get into politics.

1986
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:19,200
We wouldn't stand a chance then.

1987
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:20,280
But, you need men to...

1988
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,720
I'll handle it.

1989
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,800
We should stake claim only
for good initiatives.

1990
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,520
We have to distance
ourselves from the bad.

1991
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,040
You don't get involved in this.

1992
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:28,160
We'll handle this.

1993
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:31,160
Hey!

1994
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:35,400
Hey, stop

1995
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:36,880
Don't leave him

1996
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:38,560
Stop!

1997
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,120
There are six of them.

1998
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:20,560
After all your emotional talk,
you want to kill your own father?

1999
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,520
Don't you have any sense?

2000
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:23,840
I was the one who saved you.

2001
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:25,160
Didn't you see them attacking me?

2002
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,920
I think this is Ramaraj Pandian's work.

2003
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,760
I've been in politics along
with him for 30 years.

2004
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,360
He won't do this.

2005
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,960
You trust him over your own son.

2006
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,360
Not another verse from the 'Thirukkural'

2007
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,840
Doctor, please sedate me.

2008
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:39,920
I didn't do this.

2009
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:41,640
I did.

2010
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:56,040
You worked against me.
Now, you've planned to kill my father.

2011
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,200
I didn't tell them to attack
your father.

2012
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,480
I told them to attack you.

2013
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:02,680
You have the guts to tell me
what you did.

2014
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,400
Police!

2015
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:08,000
You signed two contracts.
Did you even read it once?

2016
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:09,280
No.

2017
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:13,800
Clause 23(a) states that I can work for
your competitor if I feel the need.

2018
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:17,000
You should not sign a corporate
contract without reading it.

2019
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,520
I'm an idiot and I signed
without reading the contract.

2020
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,680
What about Ramaraj Pandian?

2021
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,040
Is he an idiot too?

2022
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,680
Where is she?

2023
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:26,720
She won't come anymore.

2024
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:28,000
The contract has expired.

2025
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:29,160
Read it.

2026
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:32,280
It says three days or three ideas
whichever happens first.

2027
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,240
You signed without reading
the contract.

2028
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:38,520
Some people have a larger-than-life image.

2029
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,520
But in reality they're not all that big.

2030
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,720
Your father told us that about
Ramaraj Pandian.

2031
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,600
You thought I was a loser
and I made you lose as well.

2032
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:54,240
A father might lose
but he'll want his son to win.

2033
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:55,720
That's how I felt too.

2034
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,000
That's why I listened to this girl.

2035
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,560
I didn't want you to turn out like me.

2036
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:05,200
You did many hasty things.

2037
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,880
What if he did something to
spoil all your efforts?

2038
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:10,080
We won't even have the time
to react.

2039
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:11,040
We will be in danger

2040
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:12,680
That's why I didn't allow him
to think.

2041
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:14,240
I made him do things that
would benefit us.

2042
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:18,880
To win, we need something
bigger than all that we've done.

2043
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,320
That is sympathy.

2044
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:23,440
Nothing can beat the power
of sympathy.

2045
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,720
He said he could sleep-walk
his way to winning.

2046
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:32,360
Now you can sleep-walk
your way to winning.

2047
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,400
It still hurts. I'm not even
able to greet you.

2048
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:48,440
I am doing this for you.

2049
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,720
Will you attempt killing a person
if they fight injustice?

2050
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:53,520
I will fight till I die.
Don't forget to vote for me.

2051
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:03,880
"Brother is neither mass nor boss.
It is not an easy thing to win."

2052
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:10,080
"He is not a handsome person,
but there is no choice."

2053
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:17,480
"Where to keep your face? Oh god!
Will give offering to Muni deity."

2054
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:23,640
"He broke the nose, how will you
eat your food?"

2055
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:28,760
"He tore you to pieces. Oh god!
He blew you off."

2056
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,280
"You shake a leg..."

2057
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:35,240
"He tore you to pieces. Oh god!
He blew you off."

2058
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:38,240
"Dappa dappa pappa pararappa..."

2059
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:07,640
"You became confused.
You got burnt as black."

2060
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:11,120
"You leaned to a side...
Oh Oh..."

2061
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:16,000
"I lifted the range, gave the change.
I'll play on the swing."

2062
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:20,880
"Hey, my Ganguli. Your game is over."

2063
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:24,040
"Old tomato, move to a side,
wastrel!"

2064
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:27,360
"Come on, Partner! You can take
up another job."

2065
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:29,440
"Jolly jolly...
have a good time."

2066
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:34,560
"He tore you to pieces. Oh god!
He blew you off."

2067
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:38,160
"You shake a leg, friend!
He took apart your shirt."

2068
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:43,480
"Oh God! He ripped you apart.
He set you open."

2069
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:50,720
'Our Lalgudi's belove Brother'

2070
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:00,200
Following Bhojappan's arrest
on charges of corruption...

2071
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:04,560
...the by-elections at Lalgudi saw
LKG emerge as the winner.

2072
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:06,480
While he takes charge
as the new CM...

2073
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,040
...there are widespread protests
in Tamil Nadu against this.

2074
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:13,840
Benami government down down!

2075
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:18,400
Corrupt government down down!

2076
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,560
You won the election somehow.

2077
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:38,120
I am not surprised.

2078
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:42,760
Ramaraj Pandian has spoken about me
to the higher-ups in Delhi.

2079
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,440
They are going to arrest me tonight.

2080
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:49,680
But he can't take over our
party and governance.

2081
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:51,400
I've made the necessary arrangements.

2082
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:54,040
Be the acting CM till I return.

2083
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,320
That is only if you return...

2084
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:11,680
I, Lalgudi Karuppiah Gandhi...

2085
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:16,520
He is shot.

2086
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:44,880
Bulletproof vest...

2087
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:47,920
I don't trust your men.

2088
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,600
If I can bribe you, you might allow
someone to come in.

2089
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,880
Help me stand up.

2090
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:03,200
Stop it.

2091
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,480
Corrupt government down down!

2092
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,520
Benami government down down!

2093
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:14,360
What kind of a government is this?

2094
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,760
Anyone can become a CM
and form a government.

2095
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:20,920
You're murdering democracy.

2096
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,520
Your anger is reasonable.

2097
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:24,640
The person you voted to be
the CM is no more.

2098
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,680
The person who grabbed power and
became the acting CM is now in jail.

2099
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:28,400
Another person is now the CM.
Your anger is reasonable.

2100
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:30,760
But how should you express it?
By using a gun?

2101
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,120
You will shoot me down today.

2102
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:35,200
Tomorrow there will another guy.
You will shoot him too.

2103
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:37,760
What about the guy after that?
How many will you kill?

2104
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:41,960
You had a weapon stronger
than a gun.

2105
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:43,120
Your vote.

2106
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:45,320
Why didn't you express your
anger while voting?

2107
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:47,360
You could have made me lose.

2108
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:52,840
The man there contested
in the same election I did.

2109
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:58,880
He is educated. He gave up his job
to do something for society.

2110
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:01,560
He was an independent candidate.
His symbol was a tie.

2111
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:03,120
Do any of you know him?

2112
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:05,280
He got 413 votes.

2113
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,720
Who defeated him?

2114
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:08,600
Was it me?
No. You made him lose.

2115
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:14,280
Every election in Tamil
Nadu has independent

2116
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:17,160
candidates wanting to
make a difference.

2117
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:19,760
Do we even acknowledge them?

2118
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,120
We know only two parties,
two election symbols.

2119
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:24,120
Aren't all your votes caste-based?

2120
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:26,040
You bought your votes?
Didn't you?

2121
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,080
I agree.

2122
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:29,400
We politicians give
money and buy votes.

2123
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,240
But, who sells their votes?

2124
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:34,800
If we are corrupt because
we buy votes, what are you?

2125
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,360
You hesitantly take money
for your vote...

2126
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:46,080
...but that gives politicians the audacity
to run scams worth crores.

2127
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:50,080
How many of you have paid
fines instead of bribing policemen?

2128
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:54,440
How many of you have got
your license without paying for it?

2129
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:58,000
We believe only bribes work.

2130
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,720
We are just like you.

2131
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,520
When I am one of you,
how can I be a good leader?

2132
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:05,200
How are we different from
each other?

2133
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,720
How are you different from
any politician?

2134
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,480
Yes, the entire system is corrupt.

2135
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,080
Is there no redemption then?
There is a way.

2136
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:15,440
You believe someone somewhere,
an actor...

2137
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:18,640
...or a popular person entering politics
might be the answer.

2138
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:20,680
Instead, place your faith in
your children.

2139
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:27,120
You wish for your child to become
a doctor or an engineer.

2140
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:29,400
Wish for your child to be a
good human being.

2141
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:33,640
Let the future generation shun corruption.

2142
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,960
If an entire generation is good...

2143
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,280
...their leader will also
be good.

2144
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:46,040
Let's talk about today.

2145
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,360
You shot me thinking
I'm Bhojappan's puppet...

2146
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,880
...and that this is a
benami government.

2147
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:53,080
I'm your person.

2148
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:56,200
This is not a benami government.
It's pro people.

2149
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:57,640
You don't believe me?

2150
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:00,240
My first signature after taking charge
is to request for CBI...

2151
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:04,560
...to investigate all the corruption
charges against Bhojappan.

2152
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:08,520
If someone opposes this,
I'll resign my post.

2153
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:11,360
If you don't believe me,
shoot me.

2154
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:13,880
I'll remove my bulletproof vest.
Shoot me down.

2155
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:20,040
Everything is as per law.
You tell me if I should take charge.

2156
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,920
Should I take charge?

2157
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:32,720
You can.

2158
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:35,160
You can.

2159
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:36,840
Take charge.

2160
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:43,480
Take charge

2161
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:49,560
'To be a good politician,
you don't have to be a good person.'

2162
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:51,560
'You just have to say the right things
and they will believe you.'

2163
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:54,680
'They have talked their way
to ruling the country.'

2164
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:59,720
"They act like truthful great men."

2165
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:04,000
"At the right time, they are looting
in many ways."

2166
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:08,440
"By acting like devotee,
they trap the common people."

2167
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,160
I, Lalgudi Karuppiah Gandhi...

2168
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:16,400
"How long will they cheat
in this country?"

2169
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:20,840
"How long will they cheat
in this country?"

2170
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:24,320
"In their own country...
In our country..."

2171
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:29,640
"How long will they cheat
in this country?"

2172
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:33,280
"In their own country...
In our country..."

2173
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:39,160
"They act like truthful great men."

2174
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:50,960
"They act like truthful great men."

2175
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,520
"At the right time, they are looting
in many ways."

2176
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:59,880
"At the right time, they are looting
in many ways."

2177
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:05,800
"By acting like devotee,
they trap the common people."

2178
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:10,400
"How long...for how long..."

2179
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:15,800
"How long will they cheat
in this country?"

2180
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:19,880
"In their own country...
In our country..."

2181
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:50,120
"There is bravery only in talk.
What they do is only bargain."

2182
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:56,200
"Giving promises is usual.
Forgetting that is their habit."

2183
01:58:56,560 --> 01:59:01,960
"They'll fall on anybody's feet.
After that they'll even topple that person."

2184
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:07,840
"They'll fall on anybody's feet.
After that they'll even topple that person."

2185
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:13,920
"How long...for how long..."

2186
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,200
"How long will they cheat
in this country?"

2187
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:22,400
"In their own country...
In our country..."

2188
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:29,040
"Country... motherland..."

2189
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:35,240
"Country...hometown"

2190
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:41,240
"Country... motherland..."

2191
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:47,040
"Country...hometown"

2192
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:52,840
"They'll give money in abundance.
They'll even hug old lady."

2193
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:58,560
"Entering the hut of the poor, they'll
drink the porridge there."

2194
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:04,320
"They'll say they are one among them.
After winning they'll ask, who are you?"

2195
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:10,320
"They'll say they are one among them.
After winning they'll ask, who are you?"

2196
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:14,880
"How long will they cheat
in this country?"

2197
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:18,680
"In their own country...
In our country..."

2198
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:24,200
"They act like truthful great men."

2199
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:28,720
"At the right time, they are looting
in many ways."

2200
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:33,080
"At the right time, they are looting
in many ways."

2201
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:38,760
"By acting like devotee,
they trap the common people."

2202
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:43,920
"How long...for how long..."

2203
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:48,840
"How long will they cheat
in this country?"

2204
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:53,360
"In their own country...
In our country..."
