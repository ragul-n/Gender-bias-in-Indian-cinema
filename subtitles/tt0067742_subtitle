1
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:54,525
I forgot to feed you.

2
00:03:58,706 --> 00:03:59,968
Please pardon me.

3
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:08,237
Some people are coming again
to talk of my wedding.

4
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,377
I know I won't be liked.

5
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:16,380
So I am not going to meet them

6
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:29,828
Are you badly hurt?
Don't cry!

7
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,965
I'll take you to father.
He'll help you.

8
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:03,097
What's the matter, Kanchan?

9
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:14,476
An innocent, shy girl like her!
How can she speak?

10
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:21,051
How did you dare to
come so far?

11
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,057
What has happened to him?

12
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,287
Oh... it's a minor injury!

13
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:34,398
But we attend to humans...
not birds!

14
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,934
He'll be fine.

15
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:52,678
Now he'll be alright. Are you
happy now?

16
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,382
What about the dressing?

17
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,555
Give him an injection too.

18
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,088
In fact, admit him in the hospital.

19
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,428
When would you
finish your work?

20
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,065
I have been waiting for breakfast?

21
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:16,202
Oh Kanchan... have come alone?

22
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,809
Her bird is hurt.

23
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:24,876
Kanchan... I have been looking
for you all over.

24
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:28,986
Mother is annoyed at you.
Come home.

25
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,546
No I won't.

26
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,349
Why?

27
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:36,026
That boy's family
is coming over.

28
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,254
Oh yes! I was told about it.

29
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,466
Go home, Kanchan.

30
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,999
And don't be quiet. Talk to them.

31
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,297
Smile, laugh and
make tea for them

32
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,065
Keep quiet Lily.

33
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,468
Go now.

34
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,999
Please sit down dear.

35
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:21,239
I am Roopa... l've graduated
this year.

36
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,534
I am Kamini and I am
doing my Masters.

37
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:27,338
Please eat? Where's everyone?

38
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:31,016
Your father is away and your
mother has gone looking for you!

39
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,310
For me?

40
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,781
Didn't they tell you
that we are coming over?

41
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:37,320
To talk of your marriage
with Narendra.

42
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:44,793
They were right. She is one in
a million.

43
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,766
She's so nice.

44
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,366
Please don't exaggerate.

45
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,874
What does Narendra do?

46
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:04,243
He's an Engineer
with the government!

47
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,810
What's his salary?

48
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:09,921
Oh... Only a thousand rupees.

49
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,858
But it would soon increase to
Five thousand.

50
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:16,063
Nevertheless he has everything.

51
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,595
A house and a car.

52
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,596
He has a car!
Then this marriage is certain.

53
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,951
You all are mistaken.

54
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,021
You come to meet my sister
Kanchan, and not me.

55
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,586
When did you come?

56
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,594
Mummy! I have found out
everything.

57
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,529
It's a good proposal.
Finalize things.

58
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:10,345
Say Hello and sit down.

59
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,977
These two are twins.

60
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,053
Are you also doing
your Masters?

61
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,787
No. She may not be as
educated.

62
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,553
...But she is very talented.

63
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,197
Both are poles apart.

64
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,630
For Narendra, Kamini
would be best.

65
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,132
What's the matter?

66
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:34,872
We like the girl.

67
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,106
Oh Good. Take their blessings.

68
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:42,108
No... not her... we like Kamini.

69
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:49,712
Narendra is modern and needs
a modern wife.

70
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:52,049
But this is not possible!

71
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,418
Why not?

72
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,389
Kamini does not want
to marry now.

73
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:59,996
And even we want Kanchan to
get married first.

74
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:04,931
If you decide... write to us.
But we like Kamini.

75
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:20,016
Everyone rejects this girl.

76
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:22,779
She has become a burden on me.

77
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:32,194
He was engrossed fishing...

78
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,797
...and I caught him.

79
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,432
What's the matter?

80
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,331
Those people were coming to
meet Kanchan today?

81
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,505
Not today... on Saturday.

82
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,071
Today is Saturday

83
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,140
And those people have come
and gone.

84
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,308
What did they decide?

85
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:51,608
Same as usual. They like
Kamini, not Kanchan.

86
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,956
Idiots. Such people should
not be entertained.

87
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,121
When did you come?

88
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:04,922
Just now! And I am leaving
right away.

89
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:08,590
Don't say No. I am off to
Kashmir with friends

90
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,029
Why should I say No.
Do go.

91
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,770
Don't cry Kanchan.

92
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,278
I didn't know I would
mess up things.

93
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,849
Don't get depressed.

94
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,018
She's just a burden.

95
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:35,427
Don't curse her.
She's innocent.

96
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,093
From today, I take
her responsibility.

97
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,764
I would find the
right match for her.

98
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:47,605
It's all for the good
that happens.

99
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,001
Father is right, mother.

100
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,270
Oh... they are here. I am going.

101
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,335
Come on. There's a guesthouse

102
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,942
What a beautiful house!

103
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,050
It's totally deserted.

104
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,111
All because you wanted
to enjoy the snow.

105
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:44,090
Keep quiet.
Give me time to think.

106
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,629
Keep thinking the whole night.

107
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,565
I am freezing.

108
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,297
And I am hungry.

109
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,842
Good for you.
This is life.

110
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:02,444
Hunger... Cold...
a dark night...

111
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,479
Anything could happen the
next moment...

112
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:08,681
Ghost.

113
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,057
Cowards... Move aside.

114
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,858
Who are you?

115
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,090
The guard of this place!

116
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,294
Just what I wanted.

117
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,504
Alright... we are stuck for
the night...

118
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:31,268
Make all arrangements
for our stay.

119
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,512
What would we get to eat?

120
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:42,851
Why don't you answer?

121
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,689
What can we get?

122
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:50,658
Nothing. Not in this
stormy night.

123
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:55,059
People make their own arrangements
when they come here.

124
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,130
At least something must be there!

125
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,435
Tea... Drink it and Sleep well.

126
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,834
That's Good.

127
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:05,738
But without sugar and milk.

128
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,080
Oh no...

129
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,454
What's that over there?

130
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,387
Army Officer's Mess.

131
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:23,189
No one can go there.

132
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:35,502
That was a wonderful shot.

133
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,978
No, it wasn't.

134
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:46,509
Oh then I take back my words.

135
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:58,153
Play your cards, Captain.

136
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,996
I am thinking.

137
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:05,404
Thinking affects health.
Please eat something.

138
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:06,798
Just wait.

139
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,871
My heart is beating.

140
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:12,044
And why is that?

141
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:17,545
Because you are an idiot...
don't you get the clue?

142
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:24,756
Oh heart... I thought your
heart is actually beating.

143
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,926
Stop the game.
You are cheating.

144
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,162
What cheating?

145
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,294
Ask your heart?

146
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,071
You are wrong!

147
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,573
I am never wrong.

148
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,145
You can't shout and
impress me.

149
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:55,154
The decision has been
taken, Major.

150
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:59,783
Decision makers must be
fools like you.

151
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,119
What?

152
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:08,991
It's not one flower that makes
a garden...

153
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:13,696
...We are nothing all alone.

154
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,408
What a good thing to say.

155
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,270
If only one country could
understand this...

156
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:25,414
We would have not been
wasting money on wars.

157
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,516
Every country would have
been peaceful.

158
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:33,083
Don't talk of peace
in this era, Captain.

159
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,657
Are you not in your senses?

160
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,522
The winds of time have changed.

161
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:40,366
That I seek blessings to
return to my senses.

162
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:46,033
Great poetry.
I feel like kissing you.

163
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:56,142
You should hold a pen, not a gun.

164
00:16:56,483 --> 00:17:03,389
Not just flowers but even thorns
are my friends...

165
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:09,785
That was some poetry

166
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:14,160
In fact, even I do some poetry.

167
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,945
Please listen...

168
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:34,186
Like a humble servant I serve...

169
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,617
Pleasing people
I make a living.

170
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:58,234
That should be enough.

171
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,603
From today you are the master
and I am your disciple.

172
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:09,250
Now please get something
hot to eat.

173
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,887
That's my duty Sir.

174
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:43,281
Catch... Catch the thief.

175
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,944
Stop, or else I'll shoot.

176
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,599
Who's it?

177
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:33,030
A girl.

178
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:36,537
She's unconscious.

179
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,267
Let's take her to the mess.

180
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:56,789
She's a girl.

181
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,731
A new inspiration to his poetry.

182
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,499
Let me check her.

183
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:10,171
She's totally cold.

184
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,573
What are you doing?
Call Dr. Swami!

185
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,778
Call Dr. Swami

186
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,184
I think let's give her
some Brandy.

187
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,020
What are you thinking?
Give her.

188
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:31,586
Get some Brandy.

189
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,077
Keep drinking.

190
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:57,617
Nothing has happened to me.
I am perfectly alright.

191
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,823
Oh so you are in your senses.
- Yes.

192
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,152
I was just acting unconscious.

193
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,588
At our cost?

194
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:09,267
Who are you?
- A girl.

195
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,230
Alright. But what
brings you here?

196
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,574
Why did you steal?

197
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:15,806
Where do you stay?

198
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:19,705
Don't ask so many questions
at the same time.

199
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:23,576
We girls came to see
the snowfall.

200
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,250
Got stuck in the storm!
Next question?

201
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:32,789
Reason for trespassing?

202
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,426
We are all dying of hunger!

203
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:45,433
You risked your life
for your friends?

204
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:54,077
Life is an adventure!

205
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,440
Wonderful.

206
00:21:55,749 --> 00:22:00,686
You could be court martialled
for this!

207
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:02,488
What's that?

208
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:03,916
Rigorous punishment.

209
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,555
That can wait till tomorrow.

210
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,259
Please give me something
to eat now.

211
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,864
How many of you are there?

212
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,358
Ten plus two.

213
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,730
Means a dozen

214
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,406
What is the age group
of the girls?

215
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:30,745
We fight for the country but we
help civilians too.

216
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:34,478
Especially young girls
in trouble.

217
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,081
Get all the food packed.

218
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:54,797
Sir, as per rules we
can't do this.

219
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,574
I take the responsibility.

220
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:01,645
Who's unconscious?
Where's the patient?

221
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:09,278
Patient regained before
you could reach here.

222
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,362
Did you see how hungry we were?

223
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,658
Everything is over.

224
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:25,228
At least I could be of some help.

225
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:31,006
We'll always remember this.
Thanks a lot.

226
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:33,209
Thank her for all this.

227
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:37,482
And we wouldn't have been lucky
to meet you.

228
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:42,916
Well, if destiny wants,
people surely meet.

229
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:46,322
You seem to be in a hurry
to get back.

230
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,294
What would happen if you
are a little late...

231
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:57,132
You too are becoming poetic

232
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:03,204
Do you know that
he is a good poet?

233
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:06,803
You seem to know his horoscope!

234
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:12,250
Well, I saw him being appreciated
by his friends while stealing.

235
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:17,085
I always thought military officers
were stern

236
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,457
Even I thought so before
joining the army.

237
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:31,227
I joined the army only on my
father's insistence.

238
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:39,068
And now it's discipline,
duty and this uniform.

239
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,970
Don't you feel
trapped in all this?

240
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,272
Not at all.

241
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:49,785
There is so much of
natural beauty here...

242
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:55,655
And occasionally I get to meet
lovely people like you.

243
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:58,192
Would you remember us?

244
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:01,659
Of course... Only memories remain
...What else?

245
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:07,436
Flowers blossom to scatter

246
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,871
As hearts meet to part...

247
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,341
Wonderful... is it
written by you?

248
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,808
Yes...

249
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:18,539
So please say the whole poetry.
Please.

250
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:21,116
Pardon me
...But I am getting late.

251
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:25,857
A poet is never bound by time.
Please say it.

252
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,488
Only because you have requested
...I will...

253
00:25:54,354 --> 00:26:07,597
"Flowers blossom here to scatter"

254
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:14,535
"Just as hearts meet
here to part"?

255
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:18,642
"Flowers blossom here."

256
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:36,961
"This weather of love may not
remain tomorrow..."

257
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:43,658
"This season may not
be here again"

258
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:53,469
"This weather of love may not
remain tomorrow..."

259
00:26:53,780 --> 00:27:00,515
"This season may not
be here again"

260
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:07,419
"So let's spend these few
moments in love"

261
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:17,797
"Flowers blossom here to scatter"

262
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:48,466
"The waterfalls carry the
secrets of the clouds..."

263
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:55,163
"Like flowers carry a
fire in their hearts..."

264
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:05,245
"The waterfalls carry the
secrets of the clouds..."

265
00:28:05,485 --> 00:28:11,947
"Like flowers carry a
fire in their hearts..."

266
00:28:12,225 --> 00:28:18,494
"Let this beauty too reflect
in your heart.

267
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:29,230
"Flower blossom here to scatter"

268
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:46,089
"This heart is longing..."

269
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:49,318
"and this night is seeking..."

270
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:56,228
"There are some sweet words
hidden behind your lips"

271
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:02,931
"This heart is longing..."

272
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:06,168
"and this night is seeking..."

273
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:12,941
"There are some sweet words
hidden behind your lips"

274
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:19,522
"Give all your happiness
to this beautiful moment"

275
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:26,595
"Flowers blossom here to scatter"

276
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:33,032
"Just as hearts
meet here to part"

277
00:29:33,406 --> 00:29:37,172
"Flowers blossom here."

278
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:46,006
Excellent. That was great.

279
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,388
Do you know why you are
called here?

280
00:29:56,763 --> 00:30:00,426
I apologize Sir... I did not
take your permission.

281
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:02,433
What are you talking about?

282
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:17,277
You can punish me whichever
way you want!

283
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:19,016
Don't be crazy!

284
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:21,782
It's the duty of the army to
help civilians.

285
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:25,852
If I was in your place I would
have taken them to my room!

286
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,123
To your room, Sir?

287
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:32,194
I mean, I would have offered
them dinner.

288
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:33,562
Why are you laughing?

289
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,824
Permit me to call you great Sir!

290
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,135
I was unnecessarily worked up!

291
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,666
You are a useless poet.
Where are the girls?

292
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:45,104
At the guesthouse, Sir!

293
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:50,880
Why are you here! Isn't it
time for breakfast?

294
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,179
Call the girls for breakfast!

295
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:57,055
Invite them on my behalf.

296
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,857
Yes Sir.

297
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:16,736
Where are the girls?

298
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,441
They have already gone!

299
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:39,329
Father, there's a telegram.

300
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:56,605
Hey... Give some sweets to
the kids.

301
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,245
Is there some good news?

302
00:31:58,518 --> 00:32:03,251
My son is returning home
after years.

303
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:11,296
Let me also play with you.

304
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:17,536
Let's go.

305
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,983
Run away! Hide.

306
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:54,970
Catch these idiots.

307
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:56,138
Run away.

308
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,945
Who are you annoyed at?

309
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:11,586
These hooligans have broken
the windowpane.

310
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:16,792
I think it was by mistake.

311
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:21,031
They are all hooligans.

312
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,792
I would bash them if they
come in front of me.

313
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,803
Alright... then I'll come in.

314
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:40,508
Here I am... Bash me up.

315
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,151
What do you mean?

316
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:46,217
I am the culprit!

317
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,457
You?

318
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:55,123
It was I who broke the glass!

319
00:33:55,534 --> 00:34:00,870
Oh God... and you listened to
all my abuses.

320
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,768
That I listen to everyday.

321
00:34:06,646 --> 00:34:08,546
Please pardon me.

322
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:11,715
Like I pardon her everyday.

323
00:34:11,951 --> 00:34:13,213
Please be quiet.

324
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:20,458
I am very happy today!

325
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,789
Why... what has happened?

326
00:34:29,702 --> 00:34:34,662
After four years my son is
coming back home.

327
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,431
Your son? Are you married?

328
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:40,371
This man has grown old.

329
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:45,740
I am not married
...yet I have a son.

330
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:56,656
I am proud of him. He means
everything to me.

331
00:34:57,797 --> 00:35:03,292
Have you forgotten... the son
of our dear military officer.

332
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,363
Please do bring him here too.

333
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:12,801
In fact I want him to get
married to Kanchan.

334
00:35:14,013 --> 00:35:17,676
Why would he marry Kanchan?

335
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:20,543
He dare not say "No" to me!

336
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,219
He has to marry Kanchan!

337
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,921
Still I will seek his consent.

338
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:30,489
There's none better than him
for Kanchan.

339
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:37,133
Who's hiding and listening
from there?

340
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,746
Thank you... I had
forgotten this.

341
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:05,555
Auntie... you are looking
lovely.

342
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:06,424
Where's father?

343
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,689
At the Church!

344
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,364
And who's this?

345
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:17,076
How can't you recognize me?

346
00:36:17,076 --> 00:36:18,941
By Joe... This is Lily!

347
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:21,908
You must be worried for
her wedding now?

348
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:23,012
Yes.

349
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,012
No one is worried for me!

350
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:28,276
I'll have to find my own match.

351
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,695
You look great in this Uniform.

352
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,725
Let's have a bout.

353
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,299
Forget it... you'll lose.

354
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:51,204
How can a father of a young man
ever become old?

355
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,477
Alright...

356
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:54,945
Why are you twisting my thumb?

357
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:56,512
Well, that's the trick.

358
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,875
Alright, I let you go.

359
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,052
Well, let's call
the match a draw.

360
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:11,329
How are you. I have been
longing to meet you.

361
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:15,157
What are you ogling at!
Get breakfast for my son.

362
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:17,663
Yes... Omelet, toast and Coffee.

363
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,904
Four eggs in the omelet?
- No... Five!

364
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:28,937
Here are some gifts for you two!

365
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:37,186
I knew you wouldn't get
anything for me.

366
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:38,548
Why should I?

367
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:40,449
When I send money for you...

368
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,887
...you buy medicines and distribute
it amongst the poor

369
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:46,120
Well, because they can't afford it.

370
00:37:54,874 --> 00:37:59,470
It's lovely... in fact I had
a bad cold yesterday.

371
00:37:59,912 --> 00:38:05,748
I am changing your wardrobe.

372
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:07,007
I have everything.

373
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,219
That's all old now.

374
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:13,923
One doesn't throw things if
they are old?

375
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,127
I am old... Would you throw me?

376
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,626
Don't say that father!

377
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:23,491
I am more than happy today.

378
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:25,769
All my dreams have come true!

379
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:29,703
The words that I gave your
father at his deathbed...

380
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:32,043
...I have been able to live up
to them.

381
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:35,245
You are an army Captain now.

382
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:37,948
All because of your efforts.

383
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,247
I am an orphan otherwise.

384
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,611
If you speak like this... you
would get a slap from me.

385
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:46,187
Sure. But I promise not to
say this again.

386
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,018
Sit down.

387
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:55,993
While conducting a wedding at
the Church today...

388
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:58,863
a thought came to me...

389
00:38:59,138 --> 00:39:00,264
What?

390
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:04,873
That you should get married now!

391
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:11,280
Have you found some girl?

392
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,042
Don't feel shy.

393
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:20,855
Well, I have never
thought of this...

394
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:26,631
But then recently a strange
thing happened...

395
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:28,160
What?

396
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:36,135
I met a beautiful girl
a few days back.

397
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:40,311
We spent time together
and then...

398
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:41,806
And then?

399
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:46,177
And then she went away.

400
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:51,284
I couldn't even ask her address.

401
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:57,122
It was like a dream!

402
00:39:58,197 --> 00:40:02,463
A dream one cannot forget.

403
00:40:05,104 --> 00:40:08,403
No wonder they call you a poet.

404
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:12,942
But life is not lived
holding to dreams.

405
00:40:13,212 --> 00:40:14,577
Certainly not.

406
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,440
I have chosen a beautiful girl
for you.

407
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:19,378
Alright.
Get me married fast

408
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,516
First meet the girl and
then decide.

409
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,981
Your decision is final.

410
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:28,419
But it's a ritual
to meet the girl.

411
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:30,921
Alright.

412
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:37,998
Yes... we all were in the snow.

413
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:43,502
And then someone fired at us.

414
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,539
We covered ourselves
beneath the snow.

415
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:50,645
I saw the enemy troops passing.

416
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:54,019
I realized then, we were in the
territory of the enemy.

417
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:55,242
Then?

418
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:59,048
We captured them from behind.

419
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,258
Great.

420
00:41:00,426 --> 00:41:03,156
We saw another troop ahead.

421
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:06,660
What's that?

422
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:07,661
Gun shots.

423
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,924
Oh... then?

424
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:14,596
Firing continued till we moved
to our territory.

425
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:15,432
Then?

426
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:16,572
Then...

427
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:45,300
She is our daughter Kanchan.

428
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:50,766
Go and sit there.

429
00:41:54,113 --> 00:41:56,479
Yes... Please come here.

430
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,285
She is very shy.

431
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:12,393
Well nowadays the atmosphere
is different... true...

432
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:15,496
But, at home a girl is always shy.

433
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,629
That was a great thing to say.

434
00:42:34,605 --> 00:42:37,115
Don't get scared...
I won't reveal any secrets.

435
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,356
Did you say something?

436
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:42,822
I was asking her
about her studies!

437
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:46,953
Well, what use are
studies to a girl.

438
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:53,831
What really matters
is simplicity.

439
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,839
This is the simplicity that...

440
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,110
I'm sorry father... just
remembered this couplet.

441
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:08,815
What I wanted to say is...

442
00:43:09,188 --> 00:43:10,348
I love simplicity!

443
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:13,124
Even I love simplicity but...

444
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,154
Have some tea!

445
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,897
What about you?

446
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:22,129
Why don't you say that you
don't drink tea!

447
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,830
Are you speaking the truth?

448
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:31,535
Well, only once I had tea.

449
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:35,371
Have it another time today!

450
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,313
Why are you so nervous?

451
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,247
You have made her nervous!

452
00:43:45,257 --> 00:43:46,815
She gets nervous
in front of people.

453
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,252
But she is good at
managing the house.

454
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:54,064
And she has a good voice.

455
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:56,424
Yes... she sings well.

456
00:43:56,702 --> 00:43:59,865
I know... I mean I am told.

457
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:04,301
He is a poet... she's a singer
...two plus two.

458
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,277
Can I request you to sing
something?

459
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:15,978
You army officers are real smart.

460
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:18,017
I got you here to meet her

461
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,883
And you are asking her to sing?

462
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:23,456
Go dear... take some rest now.

463
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:30,529
Your whole life is there to hear
her singing.

464
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:32,800
Alright.

465
00:44:59,665 --> 00:45:03,965
You must be thinking
I have gone mad.

466
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:08,098
I am very happy today.

467
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:15,769
He said shyness is
a great thing to have.

468
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:20,413
And he likes simplicity.

469
00:45:21,687 --> 00:45:25,282
And then he asked me to sing.

470
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:28,292
How could I have done that in
front of everyone.

471
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:30,891
Father saved my skin.

472
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,631
I was trembling.

473
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:38,492
But he is excellent.

474
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:40,600
He is like an angel.

475
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:44,103
After the wedding, I'll
introduce you to him.

476
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:53,316
It's just the two of us...
Why are you shy?

477
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:57,246
Destiny made us meet.

478
00:45:57,656 --> 00:46:02,025
And now we will be tied
together for good.

479
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:04,592
Do you remember our first
meeting?

480
00:46:05,364 --> 00:46:07,594
I can't forget you

481
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,701
I was miserable after
you left Kashmir.

482
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:17,905
I would see you in everything.

483
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:25,149
Come on now...

484
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:59,648
"Oh my dear shy girl..."

485
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:04,014
"Oh my dear shy girl..."

486
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:12,320
"Come close... do not
tease me anymore'

487
00:47:12,531 --> 00:47:17,093
"Oh my dear shy girl..."

488
00:47:34,453 --> 00:47:40,858
"The liner of your eyes made
the night..."

489
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:49,291
"The day rose with the
decorations on your hands"

490
00:47:50,936 --> 00:47:57,432
"Your voice woke up the
musical notes"

491
00:47:57,742 --> 00:48:03,510
"And with your fragrance...
the flowers blossomed"

492
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:07,809
"Where are you, oh my beloved"

493
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:16,424
"Oh my dear shy girl..."

494
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:42,845
"Whenever I passed through
your paths"

495
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:50,751
"I lost my own road"

496
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:59,036
"From the time that
I have seen you..."

497
00:48:59,271 --> 00:49:05,073
"I have forgotten my home too"

498
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:09,641
"Where are you, oh beloved"

499
00:49:09,915 --> 00:49:18,118
"Oh my dear shy girl"

500
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:44,304
"Come close... oh you with
those beautiful eyes"

501
00:49:47,786 --> 00:49:54,555
"Stop being shy"

502
00:49:56,261 --> 00:50:02,598
"Let me write a
song on your beauty"

503
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:08,828
"And let me touch your lips"

504
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,167
"Where are you, oh beloved"

505
00:50:13,445 --> 00:50:21,716
"Oh my dear shy girl"

506
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:30,020
"Come to me... Stop teasing me"

507
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:55,614
Daddy... Mummy... I am back.

508
00:50:56,821 --> 00:51:01,815
Are you still annoyed
at me, mother?

509
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,893
A mother never remains angry
with her kids.

510
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:08,092
Where's Kanchan?

511
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:12,030
She is stupid and shy
about her wedding.

512
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,532
Must be hiding somewhere.

513
00:51:13,772 --> 00:51:15,296
I am here, mother.

514
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,269
Hi lucky girl.

515
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:22,202
The house brightens up when
she is at home.

516
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,278
Congratulations.

517
00:51:25,984 --> 00:51:29,579
So you are getting married.

518
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:34,320
Look into my eyes and talk.

519
00:51:34,626 --> 00:51:37,618
I am not him... I am your sister.

520
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:40,330
Tell me... how's he?

521
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:46,795
Good? How Good?

522
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,902
What did you two talk?

523
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:56,707
Nothing.

524
00:51:57,115 --> 00:51:58,104
Why?

525
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:04,951
He came to have tea. Besides
everyone was there.

526
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:10,888
Didn't you get a chance
to talk alone?

527
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:12,187
Yes, I did

528
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:14,362
Where?

529
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,564
In the garden!

530
00:52:17,936 --> 00:52:21,428
What a romantic place.

531
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:28,774
I was alone... it was he who
came there.

532
00:52:29,381 --> 00:52:31,872
And caught you from behind.

533
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,412
No...

534
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,552
Then? Did he kiss your hair?

535
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:40,148
Something surely must have
happened.

536
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:45,118
I was hiding behind a tree.

537
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:47,954
Exactly... but what happened
in the hiding?

538
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,960
He caught my shawl.

539
00:52:53,238 --> 00:52:55,433
Great... then?

540
00:52:56,441 --> 00:53:03,847
Then nothing... I ran.

541
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:08,416
Oh stupid... you lost
a great chance.

542
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:11,916
I would have gone to him
along with the shawl.

543
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,021
Or I would have
pulled him close.

544
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:15,485
And you didn't do a thing?

545
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,727
What could I have done?

546
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:20,526
Why are you getting married?

547
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:23,561
What's his name?
Where does he stay?

548
00:53:24,803 --> 00:53:28,330
Alright... l'll ask mother.

549
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:35,576
He's coming over for dinner.
Meet him then.

550
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:39,717
No... I want to meet him
right away.

551
00:53:40,018 --> 00:54:01,635
Who's this?

552
00:54:01,873 --> 00:54:03,465
It's me... Kanchan!

553
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,818
I hope I am not dreaming.

554
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:22,256
By Joe... it's Kanchan.

555
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:26,560
Where are you hiding, Kanchan?

556
00:54:44,616 --> 00:54:48,677
Hide from the world...
not from me.

557
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:52,545
If you are God... help me.

558
00:54:53,057 --> 00:55:00,429
I pray that we never part.

559
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:03,925
Do you love me so much?

560
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:08,738
If you don't believe me...
Iook in my eyes.

561
00:55:12,343 --> 00:55:18,043
You? You are getting married
to Kanchan?

562
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:19,748
What are you saying, Kanchan?

563
00:55:20,018 --> 00:55:20,712
Don't touch me.

564
00:55:20,952 --> 00:55:22,214
I am not Kanchan.

565
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:28,726
Who are you then?

566
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,588
Kamini... Kanchan's sister.

567
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:35,296
You met me in Kashmir.

568
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,966
Didn't you look in my eyes
and pour your heart.

569
00:55:40,238 --> 00:55:44,038
And now you are marrying
Kanchan?

570
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:50,605
Anyway... Good luck Captain.
You have chosen a fine girl.

571
00:55:50,982 --> 00:55:53,416
Please listen to me.

572
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,844
Too late now... Goodbye.

573
00:56:20,345 --> 00:56:25,749
He's lucky to get
a girl like you.

574
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:31,513
Let's go... they've arrived.

575
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:42,729
What? He wants to marry
Kamini?

576
00:56:43,034 --> 00:56:44,763
Is this a joke?

577
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:48,095
My daughter's life
is in question.

578
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:52,933
And then he chose her after
having met her.

579
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:59,915
He mistook Kanchan for Kamini.

580
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:05,416
They've met earlier in Kashmir.

581
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,652
And they both love each other.

582
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:09,951
And they want to get married.

583
00:57:10,962 --> 00:57:14,261
This is really not fair on Kanchan.

584
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:21,562
Yet, we shouldn't be unfair to
those two either.

585
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:24,270
I guess it's all God's will.

586
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:28,011
Or else I had different ideas.

587
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,272
Both are our daughters...

588
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:36,514
So if Ajit and Kamini love
each other...

589
00:57:37,055 --> 00:57:39,649
...we shouldn't stop them from
getting married.

590
00:57:40,058 --> 00:57:44,791
I can't even think... you decide
what you feel is right.

591
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:52,665
What worries me is
Kanchan's destiny!

592
00:57:53,104 --> 00:57:55,572
What will happen to her?

593
00:58:08,753 --> 00:58:11,950
Have I ever asked you for
anything?

594
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:15,790
Why did you do this then?

595
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:20,530
After giving, you took away
everything?

596
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:37,110
God's test is really difficult, dear...
Be brave.

597
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:39,849
God Bless you...

598
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:38,236
"The dark clouds have
covered the skies"

599
00:59:38,476 --> 00:59:42,742
"And I have lost my sleep..."

600
00:59:43,114 --> 00:59:47,608
"The dark clouds have
covered the skies"

601
00:59:47,919 --> 00:59:52,253
"And I have lost my sleep..."

602
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:57,559
"What should I do?"

603
00:59:57,829 --> 01:00:01,993
"The dark clouds have
covered the skies"

604
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:06,794
"And I have lost my sleep..."

605
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:35,357
"In every backyard there is
a lamp lit"

606
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:39,569
"Whereas in my backyard
my heartburn's"

607
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:44,870
"And now this wind bites me..."

608
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:49,044
"Everyone looks
sarcastically at me..."

609
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:54,414
"In every backyard there is
a lamp lit"

610
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:58,746
"Whereas in my backyard
my heartburn's"

611
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:03,754
"And now this wind bites me..."

612
01:01:04,028 --> 01:01:07,828
"Everyone looks
sarcastically at me..."

613
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:12,962
"Tears flow as I lose my sleep"

614
01:01:13,204 --> 01:01:17,641
"And I have lost my sleep..."

615
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:22,675
"What should I do?"

616
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:26,975
"The dark clouds have
covered the skies"

617
01:01:27,285 --> 01:01:31,722
"And I have lost my sleep..."

618
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,249
"My dreams are shattered"

619
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:04,783
"And all hopes have scattered"

620
01:02:05,156 --> 01:02:09,786
"Like the river Ganges... tears
flow down my eyes"

621
01:02:09,961 --> 01:02:13,863
"Yet my soul remains thirsty"

622
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:19,095
"My dreams are shattered"

623
01:02:19,337 --> 01:02:23,865
"And all hopes have scattered"

624
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:28,441
"Like the river Ganges... tears
flow down my eyes"

625
01:02:28,713 --> 01:02:32,547
"Yet my soul remains thirsty"

626
01:02:32,984 --> 01:02:37,444
"Who can I share this
plight with?"

627
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:42,020
"And I have lost my sleep..."

628
01:02:42,393 --> 01:02:47,228
"What should I do?"

629
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:51,525
"The dark clouds have
covered the skies"

630
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:56,738
"And I have lost my sleep..."

631
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,157
With love...

632
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:30,699
For me? Thank you.

633
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:32,908
Thank you for the kiss.

634
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:36,004
But what's this for?

635
01:03:36,514 --> 01:03:38,482
The date of our wedding
has been finalized.

636
01:03:39,016 --> 01:03:40,483
When?

637
01:03:43,788 --> 01:03:46,518
Five days and five nights
are remaining.

638
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:50,692
No... five days and four nights

639
01:03:51,629 --> 01:03:55,588
On the fifth night
we'll be together.

640
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:58,894
How will these days pass?

641
01:03:59,904 --> 01:04:02,839
Oh dear... don't be impatient!

642
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,535
Anyway we will be together
during the day.

643
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:11,112
As for the night...
Keep counting stars.

644
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:16,385
You should have a swim
in the cold water.

645
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,986
After I finish this cigarette.

646
01:04:21,492 --> 01:04:22,891
People will envy
seeing us together.

647
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:56,419
I'll just be back darling.
Enjoy your drink.

648
01:05:48,312 --> 01:05:49,939
Why are you so
indifferent to me?

649
01:05:50,281 --> 01:05:54,274
Look here... I am getting
married now.

650
01:05:54,585 --> 01:05:56,712
Don't dare to meet me again.

651
01:06:00,858 --> 01:06:03,793
Get married to anyone you like.

652
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:07,258
But we shouldn't break our
relationship.

653
01:06:10,935 --> 01:06:15,895
Give me a parting kiss at least.

654
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:00,909
Boss is calling you.

655
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:06,675
Who's this man?

656
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:10,248
A bad guy... keeps harassing
girls.

657
01:08:10,821 --> 01:08:12,880
Well, he will surely not harass
you from now on.

658
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,863
Yes... your job is done.

659
01:08:26,003 --> 01:08:29,996
Come for dinner and
get Sonu along.

660
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:42,350
Where's Kundan?

661
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:43,883
There he is.

662
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:51,258
Did you call for me Boss!

663
01:08:51,662 --> 01:08:55,223
Yes, I did.

664
01:09:01,105 --> 01:09:05,701
You know that this hotel is
a cover business for other things.

665
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:14,815
And your wrong doings could
bring us bad name.

666
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:21,915
I am aware of everything.

667
01:09:22,793 --> 01:09:28,026
You were asked to befriend
Kamini for our work...

668
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:32,667
and you got seriously involved
with her.

669
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:37,507
I had no options... she cheated me.

670
01:09:40,611 --> 01:09:49,610
That's always the case.
You get out.

671
01:09:52,956 --> 01:09:54,014
Should I come back
in the evening?

672
01:10:12,242 --> 01:10:14,767
Alright... O.K. Mr. Gaud!

673
01:10:39,937 --> 01:10:41,962
Can you read this?

674
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:44,433
No...

675
01:10:48,712 --> 01:10:52,113
The cost of each cigarette is
twenty-five thousand rupees

676
01:10:54,518 --> 01:10:55,485
Read now...

677
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,318
Dry it.

678
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:22,904
Deliver these cigarettes to Gaud
and take the money from him.

679
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:24,740
And the rest you know.

680
01:11:25,816 --> 01:11:28,444
He'll be dead.

681
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:34,890
Good thinking.

682
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:51,205
Don't worry Kundan...
you'll get Kamini.

683
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:54,300
Oh how gorgeous.

684
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:01,140
And mummy thinks that you
are bad at shopping.

685
01:12:01,518 --> 01:12:08,117
Good... or else I would be
shopping all my life.

686
01:12:19,603 --> 01:12:20,797
What is it?

687
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:23,071
A friend has...

688
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:25,307
I know... when has
Ajit called you?

689
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,637
At four in the evening.

690
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,458
You?

691
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:58,231
Good, at least you recognized me?

692
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:01,976
You cheated me on Ajit's name?

693
01:13:04,014 --> 01:13:10,180
Don't abuse me dear.
- Shut up, you cheat.

694
01:13:12,089 --> 01:13:15,957
Wouldn't you ask me why I have
called you here?

695
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:19,261
I have nothing to do with you.

696
01:13:19,997 --> 01:13:25,128
What should I do with the love
letters and the photographs?

697
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:30,133
Should I send it to your fiancee
now or later?

698
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:35,275
So you want to blackmail me?

699
01:13:35,545 --> 01:13:40,244
No... I just want you.

700
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:47,984
But don't worry... I have told
Ajit about all this.

701
01:13:50,661 --> 01:13:54,791
I wouldn't let you go so easily.

702
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:08,903
Leave me... Leave me.

703
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:15,028
Do you need any help?

704
01:17:15,966 --> 01:17:18,457
No, he's here with me!

705
01:18:15,558 --> 01:18:18,425
It's the same girl...
chase her.

706
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:30,019
It's sad thought... but Kamini
killed a man.

707
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:40,258
While escaping from the police
...she had this accident.

708
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:49,969
The body is untraceable.
Must have flown with the river.

709
01:20:56,453 --> 01:21:01,857
Please don't mention a
word to the newspapers.

710
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:05,285
Or else my other daughter
would remain unmarried.

711
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:09,931
Don't worry... lnvestigations
are still in progress.

712
01:21:35,915 --> 01:21:38,748
Have patience

713
01:21:40,453 --> 01:21:44,480
Why didn't God kill me?

714
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:54,493
Give me back my daughter!

715
01:21:54,734 --> 01:21:57,760
We have to forget her.

716
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:06,972
I had never expected
this from her.

717
01:22:07,247 --> 01:22:11,274
Don't speak bad about her.

718
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:14,315
This is what the police says.

719
01:22:14,587 --> 01:22:16,851
What will we tell the world?

720
01:22:19,192 --> 01:22:22,923
No one will look at us.

721
01:22:23,697 --> 01:22:25,961
No one will marry Kanchan!

722
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:40,544
I suggest that Kanchan
be disguised as Kamini

723
01:22:40,814 --> 01:22:42,441
And marry her to Ajit.

724
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,547
Are you in your senses?

725
01:22:45,852 --> 01:22:49,948
Oh yes, I am.

726
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:58,959
Should Kanchan suffer for
Kamini's wrong doings?

727
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:06,264
This is sheer cheating.

728
01:23:09,676 --> 01:23:13,407
No... I can't be Kamini.

729
01:23:13,847 --> 01:23:24,985
Accept this lie and make
your life true.

730
01:23:25,358 --> 01:23:28,850
It is for the good of everyone.

731
01:23:29,395 --> 01:23:35,425
I can't be Kamini.

732
01:23:36,903 --> 01:23:45,607
Alright... then I am willing
to end my life.

733
01:23:45,845 --> 01:23:49,576
Don't say so.

734
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:57,119
Give me a chance to weep
at least.

735
01:23:59,092 --> 01:24:08,023
If we miss this day,
we will be ruined.

736
01:24:08,301 --> 01:24:13,136
Save us. Let this wedding
happen today.

737
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:16,842
Lily is here.

738
01:24:33,726 --> 01:24:37,560
My mother wants me to
disguise as Kamini and marry you...

739
01:24:37,964 --> 01:24:40,125
But I can't cheat you...

740
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:46,268
Only if you want to marry me,
come or else not.

741
01:24:48,074 --> 01:24:51,908
Where's Kanchan?

742
01:24:52,445 --> 01:24:55,812
We've kept her away from
all this...

743
01:24:56,082 --> 01:24:59,483
She would have got depressed

744
01:25:18,972 --> 01:25:20,371
What's the matter, Kamini?

745
01:25:20,607 --> 01:25:22,837
Give this letter to him.

746
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,901
Love letters before
the wedding.

747
01:25:44,330 --> 01:25:45,695
What are you hiding?

748
01:25:48,868 --> 01:25:50,165
A love letter.

749
01:25:52,405 --> 01:25:58,139
She should have at least sprayed
some perfume on this...

750
01:25:58,411 --> 01:26:00,072
I'll just do that and
give you this letter.

751
01:26:24,103 --> 01:26:25,695
The groom has arrived.
Let's go.

752
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:38,870
Your place is in my heart
and not at my feet.

753
01:27:40,446 --> 01:27:42,607
You are God to me.

754
01:27:44,784 --> 01:27:56,889
People may consider you stupid,
but I consider you honest.

755
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:03,226
I am fortunate that
you accepted me.

756
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:09,904
I thought you haven't yet
forgotten Kamini.

757
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:19,982
Your honesty and love
has won my heart.

758
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:25,489
You are my poetry... My music.

759
01:28:30,563 --> 01:28:35,899
It's easy for a woman
to grab a man's heart

760
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:40,968
But you can't hide love
as your eyes speak.

761
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:50,072
And the lover sees it
so very clearly.

762
01:29:02,328 --> 01:29:12,704
"My mind is intoxicated today"

763
01:29:20,913 --> 01:29:28,445
"My mind is intoxicated today"

764
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:37,729
"And without any reasons
I feel so happy"

765
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:44,929
"My mind is intoxicated today"

766
01:30:01,654 --> 01:30:10,961
"Oh the Beauty of Nature,
rejoice this moment"

767
01:30:11,297 --> 01:30:20,773
"Oh the Beauty of Nature,
rejoice this moment"

768
01:30:20,773 --> 01:30:25,767
"For a saint has
turned a bride today"

769
01:30:26,078 --> 01:30:30,447
"I hope I don't just fly"

770
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:38,052
"My mind is intoxicated today"

771
01:30:38,291 --> 01:30:45,390
"My mind is tempted to be
naughty today"

772
01:31:02,114 --> 01:31:11,216
"Let's hide for the whole world
is looking at us"

773
01:31:11,924 --> 01:31:20,889
"Let's hide for the whole world
is looking at us"

774
01:31:21,267 --> 01:31:25,567
"It's a great day"

775
01:31:25,938 --> 01:31:30,375
"How can we be away from
each other"

776
01:31:31,177 --> 01:31:35,637
"I belong to you and you
belong to me"

777
01:31:36,015 --> 01:31:40,543
"I belong to you and you
belong to me"

778
01:31:40,786 --> 01:31:48,090
"My mind is intoxicated today"

779
01:31:48,394 --> 01:31:55,232
"My mind is tempted to be
naughty today"

780
01:32:16,255 --> 01:32:25,562
"My body feels overjoyed"

781
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:37,475
"My body feels overjoyed"

782
01:32:37,977 --> 01:32:46,510
"I have discovered life
in a moment"

783
01:32:46,986 --> 01:32:56,884
"Touching the skies today,
I feel great"

784
01:32:57,063 --> 01:33:04,094
"My mind is intoxicated today"

785
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:11,538
"My mind is tempted to be
naughty today"

786
01:33:12,445 --> 01:33:18,611
"And without any reasons
I feel so happy"

787
01:33:33,132 --> 01:33:35,498
You were dreaming...

788
01:33:35,968 --> 01:33:38,698
So I decided not
to disturb you.

789
01:33:39,538 --> 01:33:41,904
Wasn't it the two of us
in your dreams?

790
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:44,933
No... the three of us?

791
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:47,602
Who is the third one?

792
01:33:48,948 --> 01:33:57,447
Me... you and our...

793
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:03,890
Thinking far too
ahead dear, Kamini...

794
01:34:06,031 --> 01:34:13,028
Kamini? I am not Kamini!
I am Kanchan.

795
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:15,967
Don't joke!

796
01:34:16,342 --> 01:34:21,439
No I am not... I am Kanchan.

797
01:34:28,721 --> 01:34:31,781
Where's Kamini?
What happened to her?

798
01:34:32,258 --> 01:34:34,556
She is dead.

799
01:34:35,594 --> 01:34:39,894
This can't be. This is a lie.

800
01:34:40,933 --> 01:34:44,232
You have played a trick to
take her place

801
01:34:45,037 --> 01:34:48,370
No, this is not true!

802
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:49,608
I had written the truth to you.

803
01:34:49,742 --> 01:34:51,209
I received no letter

804
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:56,209
You all have cheated me!
But why?

805
01:34:58,017 --> 01:35:02,647
Where have you hidden Kamini?
Tell me the truth!

806
01:35:05,024 --> 01:35:09,723
There is an evil face behind this
innocence of yours.

807
01:35:10,396 --> 01:35:16,801
You can never become Kamini

808
01:35:17,069 --> 01:35:20,004
I hate you... I hate you

809
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:28,271
Oh God... Rosy.

810
01:36:32,778 --> 01:36:35,679
We are doomed, Rosy.

811
01:36:40,653 --> 01:36:42,348
Get some hot water fast.

812
01:37:12,318 --> 01:37:15,913
Whatever best that I could do,
I did that.

813
01:37:16,922 --> 01:37:18,947
Now just pray to God

814
01:37:55,561 --> 01:38:00,260
Hi Captain...
when did you come back?

815
01:38:07,306 --> 01:38:14,144
Where's your wife.
Hasn't she come with you?

816
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:15,938
No, she hasn't.

817
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:22,780
Don't be so gloomy friend...

818
01:38:23,055 --> 01:38:27,014
We are army officers... first duty
and later wife.

819
01:38:28,661 --> 01:38:37,433
Come on now... give us a treat.

820
01:38:44,476 --> 01:38:54,283
Dear friends, we are
very happy today.

821
01:38:55,654 --> 01:39:00,318
For another friend who has
become a martyr.

822
01:39:00,826 --> 01:39:02,453
Martyr on the fields of love.

823
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:09,797
And he is treating us
for his wedding.

824
01:39:10,602 --> 01:39:12,502
This treat is from me.

825
01:39:22,915 --> 01:39:25,110
Sorry I couldn't attend
your wedding.

826
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:47,764
Anyway, toast to the happiness
of Ajit and Kamini

827
01:39:55,481 --> 01:39:58,450
Even I've had a peg
to celebrate this.

828
01:40:00,052 --> 01:40:30,680
Ajit, please sing some
of your recent song.

829
01:40:53,138 --> 01:41:08,008
"How can I express what love
has done to me"

830
01:41:08,453 --> 01:41:18,351
"How can I express what love
has done to me"

831
01:41:19,097 --> 01:41:29,063
"My destiny has shied away
like have to myself"

832
01:41:51,129 --> 01:41:56,089
"Unlike the fall that takes
away the spring"

833
01:41:56,435 --> 01:42:01,372
"It is the spring that has
ruined me"

834
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:12,116
"Death comes to take life,
but Love has come as death to me"

835
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:22,292
"Like a traveler
robbed on a journey"

836
01:42:22,828 --> 01:42:32,464
"How can I express what love
has done to me"

837
01:42:49,554 --> 01:42:59,794
"What I desired, I did not get"

838
01:43:00,165 --> 01:43:05,068
"And what came in my share..."

839
01:43:05,337 --> 01:43:10,104
"...are all the sorrows of life"

840
01:43:10,475 --> 01:43:20,612
"I fall short of words that can
express what I have got"

841
01:43:20,919 --> 01:43:30,692
"How can I express what love
has done to me"

842
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:57,183
"The trumpets of joy did not
let me sleep"

843
01:43:57,522 --> 01:44:07,090
"Nor did I got a chance to cry"

844
01:44:07,699 --> 01:44:17,836
"I pray I get so drunk that
I never return to my senses"

845
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:28,743
"How can I express what Love
has done to me"

846
01:44:29,254 --> 01:44:41,189
"Like my destiny shied away,
I am shying away from myself"

847
01:45:28,046 --> 01:45:29,377
Why are you here?

848
01:45:29,748 --> 01:45:33,844
Didn't expect to see you
in this state.

849
01:45:34,786 --> 01:45:37,914
You too are responsible
for this.

850
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:45,193
After growing big, all sons
accuse their fathers.

851
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:49,059
But don't blame me for this.

852
01:45:49,434 --> 01:45:51,800
I understand your pain
completely.

853
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:55,967
Inspite of knowing this
you are here?

854
01:45:56,608 --> 01:46:04,811
What wrong did I do that
everyone ruined me?

855
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:08,481
I have no answers.

856
01:46:08,787 --> 01:46:13,224
How can you answer when
you are a part of all this.

857
01:46:13,692 --> 01:46:17,287
And you did this because
I am not your own son.

858
01:46:17,629 --> 01:46:22,396
Don't speak like this Ajit.

859
01:46:22,634 --> 01:46:23,532
This is not true.

860
01:46:23,768 --> 01:46:25,599
This is the truth

861
01:46:25,904 --> 01:46:31,740
You played with my life because
I was dependant on you.

862
01:46:31,977 --> 01:46:34,571
No... never.

863
01:46:36,915 --> 01:46:41,181
Like you, I too feel cheated.

864
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:48,756
I came to know the truth only on
the night you left Kanchan.

865
01:46:50,795 --> 01:46:55,289
Neither have I left anyone nor
have I accepted anyone.

866
01:46:56,968 --> 01:46:59,960
She is not to be blamed.

867
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:05,338
I request you to accept her

868
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:12,880
No father... I can never
go back to Kanchan.

869
01:47:13,251 --> 01:47:20,180
She can never replace Kamini

870
01:47:20,525 --> 01:47:24,052
What happens to your religion
...your promises?

871
01:47:24,462 --> 01:47:38,775
Religion? Promises?
My religion is to forget everyone.

872
01:47:44,282 --> 01:47:52,348
What did I do!
Please forgive me!

873
01:47:54,826 --> 01:48:01,891
Do me just one more favor.
Leave me alone

874
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,532
God Bless you.

875
01:49:00,792 --> 01:49:10,167
"Flowers blossom here to scatter"

876
01:49:10,435 --> 01:49:14,804
"As hearts meet to shatter"

877
01:49:16,908 --> 01:49:18,876
Why did you shut it?

878
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:26,808
Please don't play it.

879
01:49:27,952 --> 01:49:33,219
I know you miss him

880
01:49:33,525 --> 01:49:37,222
But God would set
things right

881
01:49:37,529 --> 01:49:39,258
Father is sure to get him back.

882
01:49:39,497 --> 01:49:41,192
He cannot refuse Father.

883
01:49:41,466 --> 01:49:52,968
He dare not.
He is repenting.

884
01:49:53,345 --> 01:50:01,343
But work is keeping him back.

885
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:12,096
Give me tea... l'm tired.
But I am happy.

886
01:50:13,932 --> 01:50:15,456
Why are you silent?

887
01:50:17,135 --> 01:50:18,727
Can I ask you something?

888
01:50:19,104 --> 01:50:20,230
What?

889
01:50:20,705 --> 01:50:23,367
Why are you looking away
and talking?

890
01:50:23,908 --> 01:50:26,502
Where should I look?

891
01:50:27,712 --> 01:50:31,079
I can still see your tears.

892
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:38,316
It's unfortunate that you
had to lie for me.

893
01:50:39,424 --> 01:50:44,726
You taught us how to live life.

894
01:50:45,063 --> 01:50:50,160
I know he'll never accept me.

895
01:50:50,468 --> 01:50:54,928
But don't feel sad for me.

896
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:59,674
Kanchan, let's go away
from this place.

897
01:51:00,011 --> 01:51:04,971
If he cannot accept you, why
should you wait for him?

898
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:08,379
Break all barriers, forget
him and get married again.

899
01:51:10,088 --> 01:51:19,053
No please... don't even think of it

900
01:51:19,297 --> 01:51:25,293
He may have married Kamini...
but I have married him.

901
01:51:30,041 --> 01:51:39,279
I have those dreams of his
to live on.

902
01:51:39,551 --> 01:51:47,720
He may reject me... but I can't.

903
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:29,523
Why are you wanting to kill
yourself?

904
01:52:29,767 --> 01:52:31,894
It's none of your business.

905
01:52:39,377 --> 01:52:41,743
I never got any letter.

906
01:52:42,046 --> 01:52:47,416
You cheated me. You can't
replace Kamini.

907
01:53:16,915 --> 01:53:22,478
What's happened to him?
Where is he?

908
01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:24,654
He is alright... you can meet him.

909
01:53:25,223 --> 01:53:32,823
Just that he has lost the
will to live.

910
01:53:33,932 --> 01:53:39,336
Please go away...

911
01:53:43,341 --> 01:53:46,538
I need no injections.

912
01:53:46,945 --> 01:53:50,210
You are an army man... be
disciplined

913
01:53:51,816 --> 01:53:54,649
I don't want to live.

914
01:53:54,919 --> 01:53:57,820
Shut up. Inject him, Doctor.

915
01:54:18,376 --> 01:54:21,743
You must be his wife.

916
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,514
How is he?

917
01:54:24,816 --> 01:54:33,849
He has deeply got shocked
with something.

918
01:54:35,326 --> 01:54:39,023
Medicines are not helping him.

919
01:54:39,263 --> 01:54:44,895
He does not want to live.

920
01:54:45,203 --> 01:54:48,195
Please save my son.

921
01:54:48,539 --> 01:54:54,967
Don't worry... we need him
as much as you.

922
01:54:57,815 --> 01:55:05,153
And now that Kamini is here,
he would want to live.

923
01:56:59,537 --> 01:57:07,501
"Flowers blossom here to scatter"

924
01:57:07,779 --> 01:57:15,083
"Like hearts meet here
to shatter"

925
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:25,156
"Flowers blossom here to scatter"

926
01:58:55,319 --> 01:58:57,810
You are alive Kamini?

927
01:58:58,923 --> 01:59:02,950
True love never dies.

928
01:59:06,731 --> 01:59:13,899
Kamini, I was longing for you!

929
01:59:14,138 --> 01:59:16,333
Where were you all this while?

930
01:59:17,375 --> 01:59:20,003
In your mind.

931
01:59:21,145 --> 01:59:24,444
Please answer me.

932
01:59:24,682 --> 01:59:27,082
Death is beckoning me and you...

933
01:59:28,486 --> 01:59:32,616
Don't you have faith in my love?

934
01:59:32,890 --> 01:59:38,328
It is for your love that
I want to embrace death.

935
01:59:38,896 --> 01:59:42,491
I can't live without you.

936
01:59:42,733 --> 01:59:44,428
Where did you go?

937
01:59:45,903 --> 01:59:59,647
Let's not talk of this. Let's
spend these moments in love

938
01:59:59,917 --> 02:00:02,385
I love you, Ajit.

939
02:02:47,985 --> 02:02:50,977
I am tired of acting as Kamini.

940
02:02:51,455 --> 02:02:55,186
Now that he is alright.
Let's go back home father?

941
02:02:55,693 --> 02:03:00,960
Doctors are surprised
at his recovery.

942
02:03:01,265 --> 02:03:09,036
But I know it's all
because of you.

943
02:03:09,273 --> 02:03:12,765
Not me... it's the image of
Kamini that is in his mind.

944
02:03:13,110 --> 02:03:15,670
That's just an illusion.

945
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:18,210
But if he really loved Kamini

946
02:03:18,482 --> 02:03:20,677
Wouldn't he have recognized her?

947
02:03:20,951 --> 02:03:25,650
He loves you... trust me.

948
02:03:25,890 --> 02:03:28,620
And one day he will realize
his mistakes.

949
02:03:28,893 --> 02:03:31,191
When would that day be?

950
02:03:31,495 --> 02:03:36,489
Or will I have to get his love
disguised as Kamini forever?

951
02:03:36,901 --> 02:03:41,167
Don't you read the
Holy book "Geeta"?

952
02:03:41,472 --> 02:03:47,001
It says, do your duty and don't
think of the results.

953
02:03:47,411 --> 02:03:52,747
Ajit may fall sick again if he
doesn't see you.

954
02:03:54,285 --> 02:04:03,660
I am going back today... and I
would be back in two days

955
02:04:37,828 --> 02:04:39,591
Kanchan?

956
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:43,696
At least allow me to
touch your feet

957
02:04:43,968 --> 02:04:47,062
You think I've come to meet you?

958
02:04:48,472 --> 02:04:51,066
How can I even think that?

959
02:04:51,909 --> 02:04:53,399
How are you now?

960
02:04:53,644 --> 02:04:55,544
How does that bother you!

961
02:04:56,580 --> 02:05:01,643
Please take some rest.

962
02:05:01,852 --> 02:05:03,979
I don't want your sympathy.

963
02:05:04,688 --> 02:05:07,316
I won't allow you to go.

964
02:05:07,891 --> 02:05:11,156
Move aside.

965
02:05:11,395 --> 02:05:12,419
And if I don't?

966
02:05:12,696 --> 02:05:14,857
I'll kill you!

967
02:05:20,604 --> 02:05:26,167
There could be nothing better
than this touch of yours.

968
02:05:27,378 --> 02:05:31,974
Why did you leave me?
Kill your Kamini!

969
02:05:34,685 --> 02:05:36,448
What kind of a joke is this?

970
02:05:37,121 --> 02:05:39,214
This is a test.

971
02:05:39,556 --> 02:05:44,152
To check incase you are not
double-dating.

972
02:05:44,428 --> 02:06:01,039
But now I know you are mine.

973
02:06:01,445 --> 02:06:03,003
Kamini darling.

974
02:06:19,229 --> 02:06:22,062
I'm inside. Come in,
the door is open.

975
02:06:27,204 --> 02:06:38,047
Beautiful. You've brought
the heavens to earth!

976
02:06:41,185 --> 02:06:47,454
Only you are missing. Have a sip.

977
02:06:57,067 --> 02:07:00,901
Don't forget, we need to go
for an important job.

978
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:33,493
He is important to us.
I have paid him a lot.

979
02:07:33,804 --> 02:07:36,238
Give me the dress.

980
02:07:39,343 --> 02:07:46,249
You have to pose as his daughter

981
02:07:46,483 --> 02:07:47,450
Daughter?

982
02:07:49,787 --> 02:07:52,517
Please help me.

983
02:07:56,994 --> 02:08:03,490
This scar of yours reminds me
of Kundan's death.

984
02:09:04,228 --> 02:09:06,423
Stop it. Don't remind me
of my past.

985
02:09:08,198 --> 02:09:11,167
I want to forget everything.

986
02:09:12,736 --> 02:09:14,829
Why are you scared?

987
02:09:15,205 --> 02:09:17,537
To the world, Kamini is dead.

988
02:09:17,908 --> 02:09:21,275
If you are alive...
it's only for me.

989
02:09:28,619 --> 02:09:30,712
You got the whole building.

990
02:09:36,059 --> 02:09:45,491
Kamini this is the man
I want you to go to.

991
02:09:45,802 --> 02:09:54,267
Carry this lunch box and reach
there by lunch time.

992
02:09:54,745 --> 02:10:03,847
This box is a camera with a microphone.

993
02:10:33,817 --> 02:10:36,877
Close the door.
Someone might suspect.

994
02:10:41,158 --> 02:10:44,059
There's time for him to come.

995
02:11:27,270 --> 02:11:31,502
Mr. Lal... you?
This is my daughter.

996
02:11:31,875 --> 02:11:33,137
I got his lunch.

997
02:11:34,277 --> 02:11:37,508
You seemed to have finished
your lunch early.

998
02:11:37,848 --> 02:11:40,339
I had an important call
to attend.

999
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:46,647
What's happening? This
confidential file is out?

1000
02:11:55,332 --> 02:11:56,390
Something has happened
to Mr. Lal!

1001
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:39,035
Your courage is worthy
of appreciation.

1002
02:12:39,576 --> 02:12:46,846
We are rich now. Cheers.

1003
02:12:49,953 --> 02:12:52,854
The days of sorrow are over

1004
02:12:53,190 --> 02:12:56,591
We'll leave this country and go.

1005
02:12:58,395 --> 02:13:07,030
This Saturday a special flight
will fly us from here.

1006
02:13:07,404 --> 02:13:12,432
And then it would be you, me
and a luxurious life

1007
02:13:15,178 --> 02:13:19,137
What will happen to this place?

1008
02:13:25,088 --> 02:13:30,958
A small time bomb will
destroy it for good.

1009
02:13:31,962 --> 02:13:35,261
Have some food, sir.

1010
02:13:36,633 --> 02:13:47,271
You surely are my trusted man.
Have a drink.

1011
02:13:53,183 --> 02:13:55,117
Any orders for me.

1012
02:13:55,585 --> 02:14:01,990
Yes, be prepared to set out
on a long trial.

1013
02:14:02,192 --> 02:14:03,250
Where?

1014
02:14:03,527 --> 02:14:05,552
All the way to heaven.

1015
02:14:10,667 --> 02:14:12,635
No... Why did you do this?

1016
02:14:16,873 --> 02:14:21,105
He was a trusted man

1017
02:14:22,012 --> 02:14:26,472
True. But people break trusts

1018
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:31,616
And I can't afford to leave
back any evidence.

1019
02:14:32,656 --> 02:14:36,558
"This could be your fate too,
Kamini"

1020
02:14:38,361 --> 02:14:40,386
Why are you so serious?

1021
02:14:41,398 --> 02:14:46,529
You will do the same to me?

1022
02:14:46,870 --> 02:14:51,364
Don't be silly.
We have to live together.

1023
02:14:51,842 --> 02:14:58,771
Smile. There's a lovely dance
show going on.

1024
02:15:07,958 --> 02:15:11,485
Entertain yourself.
I'll just be back.

1025
02:15:53,904 --> 02:16:31,871
"The night is dark...
do not let the dawn set in"

1026
02:16:53,730 --> 02:17:02,195
"Such nights never come again"

1027
02:17:12,882 --> 02:17:33,726
"The night is dark...
do not let the dawn set in"

1028
02:18:12,342 --> 02:18:30,125
"There is none to match me.
None like me"

1029
02:18:31,161 --> 02:18:53,040
"The night is dark...
do not let the dawn set in"

1030
02:19:30,253 --> 02:19:48,628
"Come to me. I've been waiting
for you forever"

1031
02:19:49,205 --> 02:20:11,459
"The night is dark...
do not let the dawn set in"

1032
02:20:20,003 --> 02:20:21,766
Let's go now!

1033
02:20:30,213 --> 02:20:37,745
Do something to stop the night.

1034
02:20:38,221 --> 02:20:43,124
That girl has driven you crazy.

1035
02:20:43,693 --> 02:20:46,958
Not that girl, but you have

1036
02:20:47,330 --> 02:20:53,030
Kamini... the one to give me
a new life.

1037
02:20:53,303 --> 02:20:54,429
True?

1038
02:20:54,771 --> 02:20:56,796
Yes!

1039
02:20:57,307 --> 02:21:03,405
You are in every beat of my heart.

1040
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:07,241
Without you I would have been
dead long ago.

1041
02:21:07,684 --> 02:21:12,144
Never repeat that again.

1042
02:21:12,522 --> 02:21:15,047
Alright. Never.

1043
02:21:24,767 --> 02:21:32,299
So Kanchan is fooling Ajit.

1044
02:21:32,575 --> 02:21:39,606
And here I am in this hell.

1045
02:21:39,882 --> 02:21:48,813
Death at every step without
any options.

1046
02:21:51,728 --> 02:21:56,427
What are you thinking?

1047
02:21:56,799 --> 02:22:02,863
Go and expose Kamini.

1048
02:22:03,172 --> 02:22:07,575
That's your share of happiness.
He still loves you.

1049
02:22:07,844 --> 02:22:23,056
You have an option now. Run away.

1050
02:23:02,999 --> 02:23:04,990
According to the
reports of the CBI...

1051
02:23:05,234 --> 02:23:07,202
your wife is a spy.

1052
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:10,200
No, it can't be.

1053
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:11,464
This is not possible

1054
02:23:11,641 --> 02:23:17,102
Shut up. Everything is possible.

1055
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:18,913
Read this report.

1056
02:23:21,351 --> 02:23:24,047
Facts are facts.

1057
02:23:26,389 --> 02:23:32,953
You are a brave
and honest officer.

1058
02:23:33,196 --> 02:23:39,362
I need some time, Sir

1059
02:23:39,569 --> 02:23:40,558
Why?

1060
02:23:41,571 --> 02:23:49,603
I can shoot her. But I want to
reassure myself of one thing.

1061
02:23:50,480 --> 02:23:52,209
What?

1062
02:23:52,882 --> 02:23:55,248
That scar on her back?

1063
02:23:57,720 --> 02:24:01,247
Surprising... that you haven't
noticed it as yet.

1064
02:24:01,524 --> 02:24:05,824
Anyway I spare you a night.

1065
02:24:20,810 --> 02:24:24,837
You scared me.

1066
02:24:26,482 --> 02:24:29,178
Do you always get scared?

1067
02:24:29,919 --> 02:24:34,379
I was alone and you came in
so silently.

1068
02:24:35,258 --> 02:24:43,029
Why are you afraid
of being alone?

1069
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:51,736
You haven't really told me
about yourself.

1070
02:24:52,041 --> 02:24:58,037
Because you might hate me after
knowing the truth.

1071
02:24:58,314 --> 02:25:02,045
I love you.

1072
02:25:02,318 --> 02:25:05,810
So do I.

1073
02:25:06,155 --> 02:25:18,625
The truth of the heart is hidden
behind these beautiful eyes.

1074
02:25:18,901 --> 02:25:21,369
I want to see how
much you love me

1075
02:25:21,637 --> 02:25:23,070
Have you gone mad?

1076
02:25:23,306 --> 02:25:24,898
You are to be blamed.

1077
02:25:25,107 --> 02:25:26,005
Return back to your senses.

1078
02:25:26,242 --> 02:25:27,732
That's what I am trying to do.

1079
02:25:34,884 --> 02:25:39,844
Pardon me, Kamini...
I am so relieved.

1080
02:25:40,089 --> 02:25:42,455
I won't let you go.

1081
02:25:42,692 --> 02:25:46,423
I have to do my duty.

1082
02:25:46,729 --> 02:25:51,063
I have to free myself
of something.

1083
02:25:56,973 --> 02:25:58,600
What are you talking?

1084
02:25:58,908 --> 02:26:03,072
Ask Kanchan to surrender!

1085
02:26:03,379 --> 02:26:06,007
Or else you too would be
a culprit.

1086
02:26:06,315 --> 02:26:08,840
What's this all about now?

1087
02:26:09,552 --> 02:26:16,481
She is a cheat... an anti-national
activist.

1088
02:26:16,692 --> 02:26:23,359
Keep quiet. She is a goddess.

1089
02:26:23,666 --> 02:26:30,697
You always accused her and
I remained silent.

1090
02:26:31,073 --> 02:26:43,008
Let me tell you how Kanchan has
given her life.

1091
02:26:46,856 --> 02:26:57,027
Posing as Kamini she has been
loving you all this while.

1092
02:26:57,300 --> 02:27:04,536
And you longed for Kamini
who is already dead.

1093
02:27:06,842 --> 02:27:15,682
I thought love would
enlighten you.

1094
02:27:15,918 --> 02:27:20,787
How did this all happen?

1095
02:27:22,024 --> 02:27:26,154
If she is Kanchan,
then who's that spy?

1096
02:27:37,873 --> 02:27:44,005
Kamini.

1097
02:27:44,313 --> 02:27:49,046
Yes Kanchan, I am alive.

1098
02:27:50,086 --> 02:27:54,523
Where were you?

1099
02:27:54,790 --> 02:27:58,726
I wish I was dead.

1100
02:28:01,430 --> 02:28:07,528
I am really so happy
to see you alive.

1101
02:28:08,337 --> 02:28:14,765
I am not worthy of showing
my face to anyone

1102
02:28:16,412 --> 02:28:19,108
Why?

1103
02:28:20,950 --> 02:28:24,647
My life is a tale of sorrows.

1104
02:28:25,721 --> 02:28:31,785
Time drifted me
between you and Ajit.

1105
02:28:32,094 --> 02:28:34,562
This was being unfair
to your happiness.

1106
02:28:34,830 --> 02:28:41,235
I have done what a sister would
have done for her sister.

1107
02:28:41,871 --> 02:28:48,003
I wanted to go away
from your life.

1108
02:28:48,277 --> 02:28:54,341
But I didn't expect to
get into this trouble.

1109
02:28:54,617 --> 02:29:05,118
My car fell in the river,
but I was saved.

1110
02:29:05,528 --> 02:29:07,587
When I returned to my senses...

1111
02:29:15,771 --> 02:29:19,707
I found myself in hell

1112
02:29:21,644 --> 02:29:25,307
And you did all this for me?

1113
02:29:25,581 --> 02:29:30,280
And I thought I am the sufferer.

1114
02:29:30,553 --> 02:29:33,920
But my sorrows are nothing as
compared to yours.

1115
02:29:36,258 --> 02:29:42,663
He never accepted me
as his wife.

1116
02:29:42,965 --> 02:29:49,666
Because he loves you, he's
yours. He wants you.

1117
02:29:49,972 --> 02:29:54,568
I was just being you to keep
him alive.

1118
02:29:56,278 --> 02:30:00,544
Now that you are back,
take care of him.

1119
02:30:00,816 --> 02:30:03,478
Release me from being Kamini.

1120
02:30:03,753 --> 02:30:07,814
This can't be.

1121
02:30:10,860 --> 02:30:12,487
I'll get you some water

1122
02:30:33,783 --> 02:30:35,842
You are so unwell.
I won't let you go.

1123
02:30:36,952 --> 02:30:39,079
Stay here from now on.

1124
02:30:40,256 --> 02:30:46,161
I have a great responsibility.

1125
02:30:46,529 --> 02:30:54,129
I have to travel with this man
taking this bag.

1126
02:30:55,104 --> 02:30:56,503
Who is he?

1127
02:30:56,806 --> 02:31:00,936
My Boss. The owner of a hotel.

1128
02:31:01,443 --> 02:31:07,712
If I don't go,
my life is in danger.

1129
02:31:08,851 --> 02:31:12,412
Don't worry, I'll go for you.

1130
02:31:13,823 --> 02:31:21,730
How can you go. This thing has
to be done by Kamini

1131
02:31:22,164 --> 02:31:26,692
Don't worry. I am used
to becoming Kamini.

1132
02:31:40,349 --> 02:31:45,048
Don't hesitate.
Go to the hotel straight.

1133
02:31:48,490 --> 02:31:53,860
Now the roads are clear for you.

1134
02:31:54,196 --> 02:31:59,862
They all will die by tonight.

1135
02:32:56,258 --> 02:32:57,850
Sorry darling... I got late.

1136
02:32:58,127 --> 02:33:01,028
I was waiting for you.

1137
02:33:01,263 --> 02:33:01,991
Lovely fragrance.

1138
02:33:02,197 --> 02:33:03,494
I am very happy.

1139
02:33:03,799 --> 02:33:06,131
You couldn't be more happy
than I am.

1140
02:33:06,468 --> 02:33:09,164
Won't you ask me
where did I go?

1141
02:33:09,438 --> 02:33:11,906
Wherever you go... you are
bound to come back to me.

1142
02:33:12,241 --> 02:33:17,577
I went to meet Kanchan.

1143
02:33:17,913 --> 02:33:20,848
Where did you meet her?

1144
02:33:21,083 --> 02:33:22,448
Where she stays.

1145
02:33:22,751 --> 02:33:23,911
When?

1146
02:33:24,186 --> 02:33:25,676
Just now

1147
02:33:25,955 --> 02:33:31,359
And do you know what did I do...
I arrested her.

1148
02:33:34,163 --> 02:33:37,997
Why are you worried?

1149
02:33:38,267 --> 02:33:40,201
No, not really.

1150
02:33:40,469 --> 02:33:43,302
You must be wondering how can
you lie to me now?

1151
02:33:43,605 --> 02:33:45,334
But now you can't

1152
02:33:45,574 --> 02:33:47,769
I know everything. The truth.

1153
02:33:48,911 --> 02:34:02,621
Oh Kanchan you are a Goddess.

1154
02:34:02,891 --> 02:34:07,487
I have been so unfair to you.

1155
02:34:07,730 --> 02:34:12,224
Please pardon me.

1156
02:34:13,469 --> 02:34:19,374
You came to know the truth...
I am happy.

1157
02:34:21,176 --> 02:34:26,808
Then why are you away?

1158
02:34:29,985 --> 02:34:33,250
I've always been yours.

1159
02:34:34,656 --> 02:34:38,285
Why are you shivering?

1160
02:34:38,494 --> 02:34:39,984
Why are you so cold?

1161
02:34:40,262 --> 02:34:42,924
No, not really

1162
02:34:43,132 --> 02:34:44,121
I'll get some tea for you.

1163
02:34:45,868 --> 02:34:50,737
I like this casual way of
calling me.

1164
02:35:33,949 --> 02:35:36,577
You snatched the bag as if
I was stealing something.

1165
02:35:36,885 --> 02:35:38,147
What are you hiding inside it?

1166
02:35:39,421 --> 02:35:40,285
Why are you bothered?

1167
02:35:40,856 --> 02:35:45,759
You told me once... you don't
drink tea.

1168
02:35:46,095 --> 02:35:48,393
I am giving you company.

1169
02:35:53,769 --> 02:35:54,736
Kamini

1170
02:35:54,970 --> 02:35:55,902
Yes.

1171
02:36:00,476 --> 02:36:03,104
Why are you staring at me?

1172
02:36:04,246 --> 02:36:08,910
Inspite of me calling you
Kamini you said Yes

1173
02:36:13,188 --> 02:36:15,349
I have got used to it.

1174
02:36:16,291 --> 02:36:18,953
Let's go out somewhere.

1175
02:36:19,228 --> 02:36:21,423
I'll change and come.

1176
02:37:01,570 --> 02:37:03,299
No... I am Kanchan

1177
02:37:03,572 --> 02:37:09,010
You cheat... where's Kanchan?

1178
02:37:09,178 --> 02:37:10,372
Where have you hidden her?

1179
02:37:11,180 --> 02:37:15,742
Don't hit me, please

1180
02:37:16,218 --> 02:37:18,379
I didn't expect to
see you like this.

1181
02:37:18,654 --> 02:37:22,556
What made you stoop so low?

1182
02:37:22,858 --> 02:37:32,631
You ruined everyone
and became a spy.

1183
02:37:44,646 --> 02:37:50,949
Tell me where's Kanchan?

1184
02:37:57,025 --> 02:37:59,255
Leave my hand.

1185
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:14,332
Kamini, what did you do?

1186
02:38:15,777 --> 02:38:17,142
I am calling the Doctor.

1187
02:38:17,846 --> 02:38:22,977
No... come close to me

1188
02:38:28,223 --> 02:38:29,690
Kanchan

1189
02:38:30,058 --> 02:38:32,151
Where's she?

1190
02:38:37,599 --> 02:38:41,535
Go... Save her.

1191
02:38:53,148 --> 02:38:54,581
Why are you scared?

1192
02:38:54,950 --> 02:38:57,077
We'll go far away from here.

1193
02:39:12,367 --> 02:39:14,335
There... the plane has come.

1194
02:39:59,314 --> 02:40:00,281
Start the aircraft

1195
02:40:35,384 --> 02:40:36,874
Leave him.

1196
02:43:49,544 --> 02:43:52,672
No one can save
the two of you.

1197
02:43:56,651 --> 02:44:00,382
Kamini, you cheat.

1198
02:44:48,770 --> 02:44:50,397
Wear this jacket
