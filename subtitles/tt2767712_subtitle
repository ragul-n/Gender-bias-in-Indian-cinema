1
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,338
Whether the effort is big or smalL.

2
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,338
"successful or unsuccessful.

3
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,278
It is decided by your willingness
and your motto.

4
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,393
Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

5
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,400
Head of the village, Badlapur.

6
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,573
Collector sir,
the President awarded our..

7
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,843
"district for growing the best rice.

8
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,981
The rain gods are angry.

9
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:58,515
For the last 15 years our
lands have gone barren.

10
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,790
Don't stop talking.
- What 'to say?

11
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:09,063
My ﬁle is with you since 4 years.

12
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,936
Which ﬁle’?

13
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:17,468
The ﬁle to make a canal from
Punpun district to Kiratpur.

14
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:22,611
Collector, let my ﬁle reach
the chiet minister once.

15
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,879
Sir.
Sir, you are not understanding.

16
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,878
Actually 'the file doesn't
go from here..

17
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,823
"but it comes here from there.

18
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,017
Do you understand?

19
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:37,460
But as per rules the documents go to
higher officers from small offices.

20
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,296
Who are you?

21
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:43,127
Rampravesh Pasi from
Badlapur village.

22
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,797
You are talking about law.
Law is not lawful these days.

23
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,033
Collector, we will demonstrate.

24
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,838
Do it. Definitely do it.

25
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,008
I say call the TV channels too.

26
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,109
I will give you the visiting card.

27
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,112
Take this. Even they have no work.

28
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,949
They roam the whole day.
Keep shouting.

29
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,956
They will get some job
and some gossip too.

30
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,588
But what will you get?

31
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,389
Think with a cool mind.

32
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,633
You can't speak 'to god
with empty stomach.

33
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,136
How to get that voice which
will reach to the top?

34
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,105
Collector sir, there won't be any
sound on an empty stomach.

35
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,667
But it will surely catch ﬁre.

36
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,707
What do you mean?
- Self donation.

37
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,479
What rubbish are you talking?

38
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,580
Sir..
- Collector.

39
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,654
Ii our file doesn't reach 'to 'the
'top officials within 15 days..

40
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,721
"then on the 16th day I
will set myself on ﬁre.

41
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,752
After that each day a farmer
will sacrifice himse
f..

42
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,588
..unti
 our plea is not heard..

43
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,332
"and until this canal is not done.

44
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,812
Kabaddi. Kabaddi.

45
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,841
We will do what we say.
All the farmers will support us.

46
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,317
But it won't be required.

47
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,850
Sir, within 15 days the project
will be excepted.

48
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,722
That's fine, Flampravesh.
You were 'too stern.

49
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,727
The collector was scared
on seeing me.

50
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,160
But you..
- Sir.

51
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:29,005
Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi.

52
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,440
Stupid man, do you have any sense?

53
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,977
Father.
- You keep feeding everytime.

54
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,709
Father, did you see we won.
- Yes, I did. Let's go.

55
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,850
Stupid, why don"t you understand?

56
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,418
Someone or the other
had to speak up.

57
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,289
Were others were dumb that
only you had to speak?

58
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,859
Look, don"t 'try 'to be a leader.

59
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,798
What did you speak at 'the
collector's office?

60
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,128
Sakina‘s husband told
me everything.

61
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,333
Come with me to the
temple tomorrow.

62
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,803
Surely someone has done something.
You have gone insane.

63
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,336
Sundari, 'think about it.
Ii I don"t speak today“

64
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,109
“then what will happen about
our children's 'future.

65
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,877
So will you commit suicide?

66
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,844
You put yourself forward.

67
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,522
You...
- Will you let me eat peacefully or not’?

68
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,652
Or only agree after you
ﬁnish your speech.

69
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,490
Mother, enough.
- Eat it quitely.

70
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,426
Vijay, eat your food or how
will you play kabaddi.

71
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,536
Come on, eat.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,471
Father, why was mother crying after
returning from aunt Sakina‘s place?

73
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,579
She is a fool.

74
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,013
She was saying everyone pushes you
in 'the 'front and watch 'the 'fun.

75
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,889
I told you she is a fool.

76
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,725
Our ancestors have lived
in this village.

77
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,827
Whether anyone keeps me in
the front or back.

78
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,532
..if the canal is built everyone
will be lucky.

79
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:08,201
But 'father, the teacher says
that we will get result..

80
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,940
"when all the people of the
42 villages will try.

81
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,877
Vijay, whether the effort
is big or smalL.

82
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,316
. .Success'ful or unsuccessful. .

83
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,752
..it is decided by the
willingness and motto.

84
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,851
That is what my teacher said.

85
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,295
But maybe we need to
do sacrifice for it.

86
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,728
But once the top officials
are aware..

87
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,169
...only 'then 'the canal
will be built.

88
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,462
God is above.

89
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,277
Not above. A bit down.

90
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,980
It means the chief minister.
The god below.

91
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:56,183
Father.
- Tell me.

92
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,854
I am feeling sleepy.
- Then go to sleep.

93
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:02,120
Alright.
- Sleep.

94
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,404
Stop him. Stop him.

95
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,085
Stop him.

96
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,552
Mother!

97
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,756
Please somebody save him.

98
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,376
What are you doing here?

99
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,272
Who told you to work here?
- No one.

100
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:35,114
Then what are you doing here?
- Digging a canal.

101
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,951
Ii one could dig a canal so easily..

102
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,546
.. then why would your father
set himself on ﬁre.

103
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,955
Wouldn't he dig a canal?

104
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,557
Son of a madman. Go away from here.

105
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:59,540
Mother! I told you I will come
home every 5th Saturday.

106
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,546
I've grown up.
- Shut up.

107
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,450
You don‘t know to button
your shirt properly.

108
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,819
How will you stay alone?

109
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,644
I will learn everything.

110
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,914
How did I learn to sleep alone
on the bed without father?

111
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,493
But will you stay alone?

112
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:22,332
No my dear. I can‘t live alone.

113
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,766
The boss is here.

114
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,702

He did a mistake you
could scold him.

140

Who permitted you to hit him?

141
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,249
Don‘t you dare hit him again.

You caught our boss. How dare you?

00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,601
What the hell he is doing?

168
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,404
He is supporting him
even while playing.

169
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,808
Get lost!

170
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,708
Come on. Hari,

00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,251
The village reputation is with you.

What are you doing? Catch him.

173
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,659
Hari, you lost it.
- He is useless.

174
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,954
It means you don‘t want me to play.
Alright.

175
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,231
Shut up!

176
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,799
We lost as everyone was
trying to save..

177
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,168
"themselves right from
the beginning.

178
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,272
We cou
dn‘t defeat the opponents.

179
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,340
Hey, Rajkumar.
Even you are one of them.

180
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,143
I held their captain on the
ground for a long time.

181
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,181
You didn't come around.

182
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,219
The boss was out. Fagun reached
the line. What could we do?

183
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,448
I have told you to exercise
so many times.

184
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,683
Increase your stamina.
You are playing like women.

185
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:50,990
Kesari, don‘t talk about my wife.
I will kill you.

186
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:55,322
Stupid fellow. Even while playing
he is being loyal.

187
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,361
Shut up!
<i>_</i> Shut up!

188
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,132
This happens every time.

189
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:06,265
We lose. Then we ﬁnd faults with
each other then return home.

190
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,009
You can't imagine what
we go 'through.

191
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:16,517
My mother-in-law will be sitting
outside to insult me.

192
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,087
You lost.

193
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,591
Ii we have lost 'then we will
have 'to endure insults.

194
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,819
What can be done?

195
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,795
How are you insulted?
Were you playing?

196
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:30,793
I was watching.
I am the extra player in the team.

197
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:36,773
Rajkunnar, let's invite Kishenpufls
'team at 'the 'fair.

198
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:41,843
They are worst than us as far
as losing is concerned.

199
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,812
Ii we deieat 'them in our village“.

200
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:50,077
"then we will regain
our reputation.

201
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,255
You are right. Anyways, there are
few days left for the fair.

202
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,124
Let's practice hard. Right?
- Yes.

203
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,795
Renu,
Kabaddi and food are the same.

204
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,791
The more it goes in.

205
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:10,068
Either make him cook or
make him play kabaddi.

206
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:14,606
He is not comfortable
sitting in the shop.

207
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:20,810
I have lost. Ii I get angry
it will create a chaos.

208
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,913
Then why do you play when
you know you always lose.

209
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,550
Did anyone ask you 'to play?

210
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,493
Why do you eat food daily?

211
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,128
When you know you have 'to
poop in 'the morning?

212
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,795
So?
So. . - Enough.

213
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,529
Why do you 'talk dirty?

214
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:45,167
Couldn't your 'father die quietly
that he left her with us?

215
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,977
He has taken revenge on us.
- Enough.

216
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,379
Even you are like her.

217
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,815
Mother, go in and take rest.

218
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,580
He is not going to listen.
- I am not listening.

219
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,817
Do you see this? Go away.

220
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:04,726
Yes. I am going. Even I don"t want
'to hear nonsense from you.

221
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:14,402

The fair this year is
all the more special.

255
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,047
As the chief guest.

256
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:53,614

258
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:08,330
We request him to come here
and speak a few words.

259
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:17,606
I am fortunate that I could
play tor the country.

260
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:25,751
I could play as I got an opportunity.

261
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:30,521
I was 'told that 'the 'team
oi 'this village“.

262
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:36,993
...is playing continuously 'for
7 years but didn't win yet.

263

I know that you have the vigour,
guts"

265
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:51,447
“but you can't win only
with vigour and guts.

266
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:54,576
To win you need to be conscious..

267
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,882
"alter and have technical
knowledge.

268
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,684
So with vigour..

269
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:04,819
..guts, consciousness, alertness
and technical knowledge.

270
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,761

Tell me or I won‘t eat food.

276
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,439
Even after I tell you
again and again..

277
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,239
...why don"t you listen 'to me.

278
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,577
After you return from your work
you go to that place everytime.

279
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:41,576
Why?

280
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,546

Eat it.

Beloved, I am in love with you.

284
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:18,815
God knows what will happen further.

285
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:04,894
Hari, if it happens again
what will we do?

286
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,454
Our identity is just losers.

287
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:13,030
I want to win the match
using advice..

288
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,300
..offer, punishing and exploiting.

289
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,396
Yes.

Have you come from Banaras’?

294
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,914
No! From Meerut
- Okay.

295
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:16,460
What do you do?
- I study. BA history honours final year.

296

And you?

297
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,964
I didn't get a chance 'to study
after 4th standard.

298
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,567
After 'father expired I started working
at 'the farm oi 'the boss.

299
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,444
Don‘t fear. Let me check.

302
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,712

I will get something else tomorrow.
ls it okay?

307
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,052
It doesn't matter.
You mustn't be good. - Oh god!

308
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:48,523
Whether anyone's husband drinks
alcohol or 'take poison“ - Go!

309

Hey Vijay.
- Yes. - Where are you conning 'from?

310

Aunt, I had gone to Badru‘s place.
- Okay.

311
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,829
By thinking of others welfare we
are the one who are blamed.

312
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,638
Radio is nothing compared to her.

313
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,235
h‘ she would see me with you..

314
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,172
..she will announce
it in the village.

315

What'?

316
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,881
You.. are very pretty.

317
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,724
Amazing. You feel shy on a lie too.

318
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:37,129
Oh no! I forgot to ask her name.
Listen" Listen.

319
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,645

Turn him some more.
- Heyl!

324

You turned him so much.
He fell down feeling dizzy.

Get up. Get up. Get up.

00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,892
Send me now.
- Come here. Come on.

327
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,329
Don't tie tightly.

328
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,963
It is my ﬁrst and last
opportunity to earn..

329
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,302
"some respect before
that old lady.

330

Don't worry. Watch me.
- Blind 'fold me.

331
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:18,310
Watch this. He will break the pot.

332
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,644
I will tie it in such a way that
you can see everything.

333
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,083

He will break it.

339
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,761
He will break it.
- No. They haven‘t given him a ladder.

340
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,272
How will he break 'the pot?

341
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:49,769
The pot is so high and
he is so short.

342
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,414
He will break it.
- How will he break it?

343
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,076
The pot is there.

344
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,644
His mind was already
blinded folded.

345
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,156
They blind folded his eyes too.

Okay.
He plays with some other 'team?

415
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,640
He is our friend.

416
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,176
He sits outside since years.

417
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:35,748
Sits outside.
He should be in the team.

418
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,955
h‘ a good player is
not in the team"

419
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,154
"then there are chances of losing.

420
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,660
Allow us to practice.

421
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,760
And you do your job. Alright.

422
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:55,135
Actually since you have come
here we are being insulted.

423
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,636
People take your example and
insult us everywhere.

424
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,267
Hey Sadhu, shut up.

425
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:03,810
Sir.

426
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,870
You said in your speech

427
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,847
"some here as an opportunity
for us.

428
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,284
But we believe that you are
not an opportunity.

429
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,413
"but you have come here
as good luck for us.

430
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,852
As we will win for the ﬁrst time.

431
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:17,920
That too in front of your eyes.

432
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,388
Hey, come on.

433
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:24,429
We have to win in the evening
so people stop speaking.

434
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,595
Tirne pass!

435
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:38,036
Pride whether ifs theirs or Ravens
He surely breaks.

436
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,983
Where is Sadhu?
- He doesn't know. I will 'tell you.

437
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,318
I had gone to his house.

438
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,693
He has gone to the hospital
with sister-in-law.

439
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:56,329
Why?

440
00:40:56,387 --> 00:41:00,426
I hear that sister-in-law is pregnant.
- Really!

441
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,198
She is pregnant.

442
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,941
Why do people marry?
Why do they marry?

443
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,074
Vow that no one amongst
us will marry.

444
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,676
He didn‘t come for the match.
- Anyway no one is willing to marry me.

445
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,012
Rajkumar, I want to marry.
- Want to marry?

446
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,747
What to do with the one who is at home?
- Hell with you.

447
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,691
The homeguard team is not here.
And also Sadhu.

448
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,685
This time not only
our dignity but.

449
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,319
..our heads will be put to shame.

450
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,987
Sir, 'think what has 'to be done?

451
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,692
Think of something.

452
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,898
God has cheated us.

453
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,464
What to do?
- Vijay, come here.

454
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:40,465
Play with us today.

455
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,670
What are you thinking?

How can I play?
- Why not?

457
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:48,510
I have vowed on Tulsi.

458
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,109
Ayodhya uncle,
our reputation is at stake.

459
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,745
One player is less.

460
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,721
Vijay has 'taken a vow.
Ii we don"t play 'then.

461
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:02,496
Go. I take back the vow.

462
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:08,837
Great Kabaddi. Great performance.

Kabaddi. Kabaddi.

464
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,971
It looks like a war..

465
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:22,474
"but the team of Badlapur
like always is funny.

466
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,214
This team is famous for losing.

467
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:30,521
It is giving bad performance
from the beginning.

468
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:37,089
Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi.

469
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:42,935
Our players are losing since years.

470
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:47,599
But they didn‘t learn to play Kabaddi.
- Come on.

471
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:51,070
Kabaddi.
- Catch him! Catch him!

472
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:57,217

He is lying.
- He is not out.

476
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,532
He is not out. He is not out.
- Sir, he is not out.

477
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,403
He is cheating.
- He is lying.

478
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,130
Shut up you son of a madman.

I won‘t spare you.
You beat me in front of the villagers.

Go right away.
- Vijay. Vijay!

486
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:55,071
Do you feel bad when someone
calls you son of a madmanf?

487
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,176
Dharampal Singh, both are at fault.

488
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,214
No!

489
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,614
It was only his mistake.

490
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,547
The village was disgraced because
of his father once.

491
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:07,917
Police came to the village.

492
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:13,088
And today because of him two
villages are enemies.

493
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,497
Did you win the game?

494
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:23,068
Are you happy by insulting
your dead father?

495
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,469
Everyone speaks the truth.

496
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:31,378
Your father was mad
and you are too.

497
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:36,047
Mother, you misunderstand.
- Shut up!

498
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:37,814
Mother, he bad mouthed father.

499
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:43,386
Promise me that you
won‘t tight anyone.

500
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,656
Even ii someone kills me?

501
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:50,364
Have you ever thought
if anything happens to you..

502
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,292
..how will I live?

503
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:02,777
Alright. It won't happen hereafter.
Are you happy?

504
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:08,147
Mother, come on.
It's a mistake. Don't cry.

505
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:11,647
Have you vowed to ﬁght?

506
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,789
I was watching that you were crazy
'for 'this girl in 'the 'fair 'too.

507
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,325
What's 'the matter?

508
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:20,389
We" are in love.

509
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,555
Love? Forget it.

510
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,428
I vow on my mother.

511
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:28,034
What is her name?

512
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:29,831
I don't know.

513
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,473
Why don"t you say it's a dream?

514
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:39,073
Don't you see she is like
a girl from 'the city.

515
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,878
She may be bathing thrice a day.

516
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:45,416
Try to understand.
She is not for us.

517
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:49,154
Why will I lie’? I vowed on my
mother that we are in love.

518
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,749
Why are you pulling my hair?

519
00:45:56,821 --> 00:46:01,827
Uncle, how are you?
- Great. How are you?

520
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:06,134
Absolutely ﬁne.
You are looking pretty today.

521
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,108
Even aunt says the same thing.

522
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,975
Go carefully.
- Alright.

523
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:18,115
"My beloved."

524
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:22,321
"Hold my hand."

525
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:30,190
"
 am sun rays and you are my shade."

526
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:38,467
"
 am light and you are my shadow."

527
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,043
Great!

528
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:56,519
Stupid.

529
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:03,564
I am still alive after
so much insult.

530
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:14,242
Sajid.

531
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:17,477
Sajid.
- Shall I kill him’?

532
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,071
Leave me.
- Sajid!

533
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,651
Sajid.
- He hit me.

534
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:25,916
Sajid, listen. Sajid.
- Salim go away.

00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:30,152
I will kill him with this revolver.
- Sajid!

536
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:34,355
The bullet will come out.

537
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:36,989
Sajid, control yourself.
- What Sajid’?

538
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:40,126
He hit me.
- There are fourty men at Ayodhya‘s place.

539
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:44,469
They will kill us.
- Shut up.

540
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:48,300
Sajid. Sajid.
All the problems are solved.

541
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,971
Ayodhya Singh has ﬁred
him from the job.

542
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,110
We will kill him in the morning.

543
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:56,611
Try to understand.

544
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:58,415
Cou
dn‘t you tell me before?

545
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:01,748
Dinu, did you see.

546
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:06,295
Rajkumar, I may not be intelligent
but I can see.

547
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:11,500
Alright. We agree that Dinu read..

548
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,969
"there is a grand competition
in Allahabad.

549
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,805
I also believe there is
a prize of 5 lakh.

550
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,502
But tell me will they
allow us to play..

551
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:24,847
“And we will win.
Is anyone sure oi it?

552
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:28,213
Hey Hari. How disappointed are you?

553
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:32,549
We play Kabaddi.
God knows we may win.

554
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:36,648
The entry fees is 5000.

555
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:38,921
Who will pay it?

556
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,154
And we have travelling
expenses too.

557
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,165
Can I say something?

558
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,465
A truck leaves for Allahabad
in the morning.

559
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,199
I can arrange for your
free trip on it.

560
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:55,038
It's done. I will arrange 'the rest.

561
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:59,780
Just imagine,
if we win by mistake"

562
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:04,279
"then our names will be
taken respectfully.

563
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,480
Right? Respected .

564
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,581
When the chief minister
will garland us..

565
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,319
..our name will be taken
with respect.

566
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,820
Is 'the chiei minister conning there?
- Yes. But you won't play.

567
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,293
The real team will play.

568
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:20,365
Go home. Appease your family.

569
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:23,637
Meet at the corner at
4 in the morning.

570
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:26,231
In 7 years you have completed
234 days..

571
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,776
..without holiday tor
the ﬁrst time.

572
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:32,713
As per government rules if you
work for another 4 days..

573
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,612
..you will become permanent.

574
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:39,285
A government job and a permanent one.
It is your wish.

575
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:44,120
Please agree to it.

576
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,288
Mother!

577
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,494
I refused you once.
The rest is your wish.

578
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,359
You are grown up.

579
00:49:52,924 --> 00:49:54,426
You can do what you want.

580
00:49:57,428 --> 00:49:58,566
Mother!

581
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:04,212
Mother! Why don"t you understand?

582
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:07,010
When I am not playing
why will I ﬁght?

583
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:09,449
Then why are you going so far?

584
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:12,880
Oh God! Mother!

585
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,496
Mother!
The chief minister is coming there.

586
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,931
What that has got to do with you?

587
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,434
It is. Why not?

588
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:30,436
I will meet and tell him that my
father wasn‘t a mental patient.

589
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,572
He gave his life so that 42
villages receive water.

590
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,906
And we become a village
to grow rice.

591
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:41,715
It was dad's dream.

592
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:49,652
Mother, after dad's death maybe
that dream died 'for others.

593
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:51,783
But how can a son forget it?

594
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,697
I want people to take my fathefs
name with respect.

595
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:00,898
Not Rampravesh Pasi but
Late Mr. Rampravesh Pasi.

596
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,736
Mother,
I didn't get any opportunity.

597
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:09,644
I always keep thinking how
to fulfill my dad‘s dream.

598
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:58,354
Sir, I feel Hari and Baban
will ﬁx all the wires.

599
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:05,356
Dinu, tell me one thing.
How did your family agree so soon?

600
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:16,502
What can be better than this
that you haven't lost hope?

601
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:21,874
Losing small games you are going
to Allahabad to lose.

602
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:25,853
Great.
This is how history is created.

603
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,686
Why are you crying?
He is not going for war.

604
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:31,784
He is going to lose. Lose.

605
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,519
Go. Lose the game.

606
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,392
Shut up!

607
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:42,062
You won't change.
- Dinu.

608
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:44,565
Even his father may be waiting.

609
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,837
Hey, Rajkumar.
Our half team is here.

610
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,438
Where is Hari’?

611
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,741
No. He is not coming.

612
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,948
Actually he has a job.

613
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:00,319
This happens everytime.

614
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:02,983
Sometime someone‘s
wife is pregnant.

615
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,286
Sometime someone has a job.

616
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:05,383
Sir.
- No.

617
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,486
First of all he is doing the job
of extra in the electric house.

618
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,690
We“ are as though useless. Right?

619
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,368
Sir, why are you comparing
yourself to him?

620
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:18,134
You have more than 5O labourers
working for you in your mill.

621
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,265
Shut up!

622
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:26,305
Rajkumar, he has a temporary job.

623
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,450
There are 6 members in his family.

624
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,751
Ii he works another 4 days..

625
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,282
"he will have a permanent job.

626
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:39,088
Now tell me what would he do.

627
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,925
No Rajkumar, Hari is right.
First comes family.

628
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:46,025
Hell with Kabaddi, right?

629
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,900
What he is talking?

630
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:51,238
We will surely go.

631
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,699
It is Hari‘s bad luck.

632
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:59,709
And your.. your good luck.

633
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,916
Dear, you will play. Got it?

634
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:11,049
Hey! Stop!
- The truck is here.

635
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:12,856
Hey, let's go. Let's go.

00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,023
Come on. Come on.

Give me your hand. Come on.

638
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:24,262
Praise the lord!

639
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:47,591
Hey, what's this? It's so huge.

640
00:54:48,152 --> 00:54:51,031
It is bigger than our village fair.
- Right.

641
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:54,099
This is called Kabaddi.

642
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,031
Let's go in and find
'the organisers.

643

That is the entrance. Conne on.
- Let's go. Let's go.

00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:08,910
Oh my god!
The whole of Allahabad is here.

645
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:12,483
What a great sight!

646
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:14,420
What is this?
- Stop!

647
00:55:14,945 --> 00:55:16,288
This is for the players.

648
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,890
So what? We are players 'too.
- Yes. - Are you players?

649
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:23,158
Hey.
why are you looking in that manner?

650
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,222
Let it be.
- Shall we bash him?

651
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,233
The organisers are 'there. Let's go.

652
00:55:28,092 --> 00:55:29,366
Sadhu, let's go.
- Let's go.

00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:31,997
Sir, we have come from afar.
Kiratpur district.

654
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,633
Sir, just give us an opportunity.

655
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,872
Sir, if we go back without playing
it will be a great insult.

656
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:39,845
Yes sir.
- Why don"t you understand?

657
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,614
What is happening?
- Sir, look at them.

Play? Want 'to play?

661
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:57,131
They are requesting to play. There
is a procedure, a selection system.

662
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:00,397
There is a system.

663
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:03,567
Come with me. Let me explain.
- Lefs go.

664

But this is state level tournament.

666
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:17,482
To reach here you need to compete
at the sub-district level.

667
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,312
Ii you win there 'then
'the district level.

668
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:24,055

00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,923

672
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,230
Now there is no place
for anyone else.

Look, listen to me.. Please!
- Hello sir.

674
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:40,471
But sir,
we are playing kabaddi since years.

675
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,408
Yes.
- This is not your village kabaddi.

676
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:46,380
The rules and regulation
here are different.

677
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,051
We will learn.
- Yes sir. We will learn. - Really.

678
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,548
You will learn.
- Yes, we will learn.

679
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:54,680
Come here.

Even you join us.
- Come on.

681
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:00,685
What is this?

682
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,889
This is a ground.

683
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,200
How many lines does your
kabaddi field has?

684
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,128
Only one.

685
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:12,230
Here there are only two. One. Two.

686
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:14,138
What does this one line mean?

687
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,643
Nothing.
- Here it means many things.

688
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:19,847
This is called touch line.

689
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,475
Ii you don"t touch
'this touch line..

690
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:27,554
"then you are out.
- Out?

691
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,648
Are you looking there another line?

692
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:33,752
Ii you touch 'this line and return“

693
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:39,429
..then without hitting anyone
you get a point.

694
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,228
Bonus point.

695
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,363
Without hitting..

696
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:48,299
After you ﬁnish half game
your side will change.

697
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,577
In your village what is the
time limit of the game?

..has to play the game for
4O minutes compulsorily.

702
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,517
Do you understand?

703
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,188
How do you decide who
wins and who loses?

704
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:12,393
When all the team members of
a team are hit they lose.

705
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,960
No! Here the points decides
who wins and who loses.

time to understand.

Alright.

717
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:52,797
What happened?

718
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:56,105
Mr. Singh, the Baliya team bus met with
an accident on the highway.

719
00:58:57,167 --> 00:59:00,842
We have only 31 teams for
the knock out section.

720
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:03,809
We need one more.

721

Yes.

723
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:23,771
These boys can be our 32nd team.

724
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:27,001
We can start the knock
out tournament.

725
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:31,506
But Mr. Singh,
as per the selection procedure.

726
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:36,950
Look. Ii you go with 'the
selection procedure“.

727
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:40,650
"then you will have <i>2</i> options.

728
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:45,493
One option is to cancel
the tournament.

729
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:48,996
..or you take them and move on.
- Mr. Singh.

Mr. Singh,
do you 'feel they are capable oi it?

737
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,946
I doubt they will play the
tournament even for 10 minutes.

738
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:14,681
I have seen them playing.

739
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:18,455
They are locals.
But they will play the game.

740
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,157
QKBV-
<i>_</i> QkaY-

741
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,957
There is no choice.

Whatever is there.

743
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,428
Yes tell me.

Praise the Lord!

747

Mughal Sarai team versus
Badlapur Boys.

750
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:58,559
The journey to the finals is
long and very difficult.

751
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:01,968
But every team is here
with that dream.

752
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,835
Kabaddi. Kabaddi. Kabaddi.

753
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:07,135
Raider out. Touch line miss.

How is out?
- The coach asked us 'to touch 'the line.

756
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:12,679
You didn't touch 'the line.

757
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:15,114
Play intelligently,
there are rules here.

758

Kabaddi. Kabaddi.
- Come behind. - Come on.

01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:22,145
Kabaddi. Kabaddi.

760
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,490
This is the second catch
- One point.

761
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:28,187
Touch the line.

762

01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:43,407
Kabaddi! Kabaddi! He is out!

765
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,878
Raider out! He didn‘t
cross the center line.

766
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:47,438
What's wrong?
- What happened?

767
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:50,747
Looks like he is unaware of
the basic rules of Kabaddi.

768
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:54,183
The players don"t 'feel like
returning 'to 'their court.

769
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:58,859
Kabaddi! Kabaddi!

770

Raider out!
Badlapur Boys get one point.

771

Badlapur Boys have
opened their account. - Papa!

772
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:08,194
Although old fashioned, but it was
a scathing attack on the raider.

773
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:11,632
Kabaddi! Kabaddi!

774
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:15,335
Points boost the moral of
the players. It is quite evident.

775
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,810
They get a bonus point.

776
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:22,248
Bonus point to Badlapur Boys.

777
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:25,286
Mughal Sarai team needs
to do something different.

778
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:27,982
Kabaddi! Kabaddi!
- They have to counter-attack.

779
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,415
Mughal Sarai get two points.
- Rajkumar was alone.

780
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,461
We may not see a tough game.

781
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:37,896
But Badlapur Boys are entertaining the
people with their childish behavior.

782
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:39,433
Just do it.

783
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:46,099
Kabaddi! Kabaddi!

784
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:52,010

01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:04,689
Mughal Sarai get one point.
- Get 'them all! Don't leave anyone out.

788
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:07,319
The team looks very idiotic.

789
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:10,159
They are proving Mughal Sarai
a better team.

790
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:14,635
Kabaddi! Kabaddi!

791
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:19,201

Badlapur Boys have two points.
- They have beaten us hands down.

794
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:29,808
That's what I 'feel.

795
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,650
Mr. Singh is on his way here.

796
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:41,724
You played well.

797
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:47,334
But you'll need 'to play
much better 'to win.

798
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,271
How much money do you have?

799
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,574
I have Rs. 5000.
- Get it out.

800
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,973
Give it to me. Come on!

801
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:02,417
But sir..

802
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:09,785
You will get back this money
when you win.

803
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:18,258
All of you play for yourself.

804
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,329
You don"t play 'for one another.

805
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,427
You don"t play as a 'team.

806
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:25,572
That's why being a 'team
you are alone.

807
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:30,570
Ii 'this player is injured,
'the other should 'feel 'the pain.

808
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:33,807
And he starts to cry.

809
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,010
That's more like a 'team.

810
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:44,721
You told me that you‘ve been
ridiculed back in your village.

811
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:49,858
Ii you want 'to be respected“

812

Get lost! - 'Badlapur Boys

'Mom, 'the Chiei Minister will be here.

866
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:03,510
‘I want to meet him. I will meet him and
tell him that my dad wasn‘t crazy.‘

867
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:10,552
'Get lost! Son oi a madman.'

870

875

"Mesmerizing are your eyes."

876
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:19,787
"Mesmerizing are your eyes."

877
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:25,792
"Your eyes have mesmerized me.
I lost my heart to you."

878
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:31,799
"Your eyes have mesmerized me.
I lost my heart to you."

879
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:37,804
"I was so oblivious.."

880
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:40,774
"..l couldn't sleep or stay awake."

"Your words
are working their magic."

"Mesmerizing are your eyes."

894
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:30,349
There you are.
I was looking for you elsewhere.

895
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,477
Didn‘t you leave?

896
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:36,118
Dad is talking to Uncle Singh.

897
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,586
Why were you smiling?

898
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:44,793
No. Well“.

899
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:50,535
A person smiles to himself
when he is in love.

900
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:58,040
And ii it is love at first sight,
he gets more exciting. Right?

901
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:01,780
Manjiri, let's go!

902
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:05,445
Dad is calling me. I'm leaving.
See you later. Bye.

903
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:21,925
I will see you again.
Wait for me.

904
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:26,904
Kabaddi. Kabaddi.

905
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:30,137
Dinesh, come here.
- Yes, coach.

906
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:35,012
Your blocking position
on that side is faulty.

907
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:37,278
A strong raider will slip by.

908
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,448
Dinesh, I think the coach is right.

909
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:44,382
It's not that simple, sir.
To observe from outside..

910
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,791
"and being swift in the court
is quite different.

911
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:52,595
I know that you are saying that in order
to block the raider in the center..

912
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:55,829
...I am late while attacking from 'the left.
- You're right.

913
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:59,501
I know that too.
- Really?

914
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:03,171
I will give it a try.

915
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:04,939
Wow! Thafs more like it.
- Come on, coach.

916
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,639
Come on, coach.
Lefs play some kabaddi.

917
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:09,516
I am blocking.

918
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:15,006
Kabaddi. Kabaddi.

919
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,886
Darn it.

920
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:27,658
Kabaddi. Kabaddi.
- Rajkumar, take him! Come on.

921
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,169
You really seemed to be
impressed with them, sir.

922
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:34,070
You are very happy
with Badlapur Boys.

923
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:37,311
I am impressed with you too.

924
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:43,044
No, sir. I have noticed that
you are quite friendly with them.

925
01:15:45,141 --> 01:15:48,714
There is something special with
the way they play kabaddi.

926
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:55,127
Otherwise, I haven‘t seen
you being impressed so easily.

927
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,091
Well, they are special.

928
01:15:57,453 --> 01:16:00,332
I mean every player
has some specialty.

929
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:02,130
I'm 'trying 'to read,
but I'm not getting it.

930
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:05,729
You know Khalifa?
- Yes, sir.

931
01:16:06,963 --> 01:16:09,239
He's very swift.
- Right, sir.

932
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,141
He waits tor his attack.

933
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:15,677
Dinu! He looks fat, lazy, and plump.

934
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:19,710
But once he gets hold of someone..

935
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:23,019
"he is badly trapped.

936
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,753
Rajkumar is well-built.

937
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:30,728
He throws the opposition out
like a road roller. - Right, sir.

938
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:34,097
Vijay is Mr. Dependable.

939
01:16:34,524 --> 01:16:39,598
He is calm and cool
under every situation.

940
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:42,275
Every player has a specialty.
- Right, sir.

941
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,703

‘m glad you told me everything.

942
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:50,383
Let me tell you something. It
these uncouth boys enter the tina
s..

943
01:16:50,907 --> 01:16:55,378
..
 will simply crush them.

944
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,987
And you know me, sir.
I can do it.

945
01:17:16,165 --> 01:17:18,907
Kabaddi. Kabaddi.

946
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:21,481
Dinesh! - Carry one.
- May I have a minute?

947
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:23,813
Yes, sir.
- You may continue.

948
01:17:24,273 --> 01:17:27,720
Who will replace Prakash’?
Suraj or Firoz’?

949
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:29,882
Who do you 'think should play?
- Prakash will play.

950
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:33,186
But he isn't physically fit.

951
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:36,752
Look, coach. I have decided
that Prakash will play.

952
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:40,927
You can't 'take 'this decision alone.

953
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,027
Will you make all the decisions?

954
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:45,971
I can't decided anything?
- You can. You are 'the captain.

955
01:17:46,062 --> 01:17:50,602
But I felt 'the 'two oi us should
make important decisions together.

956
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:55,280
Henceforth, I will take
all the important decisions.

957
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,715
That ends the matter.

958
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,211
So let it be.

959
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:04,121
You are creating a scene.
I have to sort it out right now.

960
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:07,192
Mr. Thakur, just a second.
I need to talk to you, please.

961
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:09,327
What's wrong, Mr. Singh?
What happened, Dinesh?

962
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:13,629
Sir, ii he is 'the coach oi 'the 'team,
I won't play.

963
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:15,061
You know what, sir?

964
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:20,402
This guy is favoring and patronizing those
third grade players from Badlapur Boys.

965
01:18:22,498 --> 01:18:27,243
Mr. Singh, you are very capable.

966
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:30,078
Why do you get into
these controversies?

967
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:36,315
I had hinted that Dinesh
isn't happy with you.

968
01:18:38,748 --> 01:18:42,252
Mr. Thakur, I don"t play
'to impress others.

969
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:49,827
I have given 38 years
to this game of kabaddi.

970
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:59,002
I don‘t need this famous team
to maintain my respect.

971
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:01,712
Nor do I need you.

972
01:19:03,372 --> 01:19:05,215
I know kabaddi very well, Mr. Thakur.

973
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:12,317
But all you know is the politics
of the game and arm twisting.

974
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:16,795
It a player tlatters you,
he is selected in the team.

975
01:19:16,853 --> 01:19:20,062
And a deserving, poor player
sits outside.

976
01:19:20,623 --> 01:19:21,966
That's what you have done.

977
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,272
You have ruined everything.

978
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:30,643
You‘

 get my resignation.

979
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:06,738
"Badlapur Boys, wherever they go.."

980
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:12,677

981
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:17,617
"..they will win a difficult game."

982
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:22,595
"World will watch a miracle."

983
01:20:22,685 --> 01:20:27,725
"They will make
impossible possible."

984
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:32,864
"Badlapur Boys, wherever they go.."

985
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:47,582

the darkness with light."

"Badlapur Boys, wherever they go.."

992
01:21:12,668 --> 01:21:18,050
"Badlapur Boys, wherever they go.."

993
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:37,870
"We swear by the motherland,
we will perform our duty."

994
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:45,344
"We have to make Badlapur
famous across the world."

995
01:21:47,937 --> 01:21:52,818
"Have to get what is rightfully ours.
There is no turning back."

996
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:57,857

He thought everyone's
pain and sadness as his own.

1344
01:52:38,519 --> 01:52:43,195
He only wished that somehow
this has to reach the CM..

01:52:44,091 --> 01:52:48,506
..if CM knows,
then the dam will be built.

1346
01:52:48,562 --> 01:52:52,840

consider CM as god.

<i>To le't 'the</i> CIVI <i>know</i> and <i>'for</i>

01:52:58,105 --> 01:53:01,643
"Fiampravesh Pasi sacrificed himself.

1349
01:53:01,842 --> 01:53:03,879
The entire village watched.

1350
01:53:04,177 --> 01:53:09,456
The sacrifice of Rampravesh Pasi
was called as madness.

1351
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:12,793
And his son was called
as an insane man's son.

1352
01:53:13,487 --> 01:53:17,060
This child grew up with difficulties
and he took a ﬁrm decision..

1353
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:19,502
"that one day if he gets a chance..

1354
01:53:20,361 --> 01:53:25,037
..then he will prove to the entire
world that his father had sacrificed.

1355
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:29,007
My 'father was not insane
and I am not an insane man's son.

1356
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:34,276
That poor guy didn't know..

1357
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:40,216
“That many Owl's came
and went in all 'these years..

1358
01:53:40,581 --> 01:53:42,288
"but the dam was not built.

1359
01:53:42,883 --> 01:53:46,228
He had to do something
like his father did.

1360
01:53:46,587 --> 01:53:49,124
With that thought,
Vijay came here to play.

1361
01:53:49,223 --> 01:53:53,569
Though he knew that this was going
'to be his last game, he came 'to play“.

1362
01:53:57,364 --> 01:53:59,344
In the semi-ﬁnal match"

1363
01:54:01,101 --> 01:54:03,911
...his shoulder didn't get dislocated“.

1364
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:14,290
Mr. Singh, see this.
These ribs are broken.

1365
01:54:15,682 --> 01:54:19,960
And one rib would've
penetrated the heart.

1366
01:54:20,253 --> 01:54:22,324
Ii he is careless..

1367
01:54:23,958 --> 01:54:28,668
In 'fact, I would suggest you 'to 'take Vijay
'to All India medical science in Delhi.

1368
01:54:31,798 --> 01:54:35,940
And Mr. Singh, if Vijay falls
on his left side, even by mistake"

1369
01:54:38,439 --> 01:54:40,544
I hope you understand what I mean.

1370
01:54:45,946 --> 01:54:49,018
Coach sir, I was waiting
for this day and you.. - Vijay..

1371
01:54:50,818 --> 01:54:54,925
"try to understand.
The game is very dangerous.

1372
01:54:56,891 --> 01:54:58,393
You can lose your life.

1373
01:54:59,693 --> 01:55:05,803
Coach sir,
my life, my death, and my existence"

1374
01:55:06,267 --> 01:55:08,713
"the dream is very superior
which my father had seen..

1375
01:55:10,003 --> 01:55:11,346
My chest pain is nothing"

1376
01:55:11,972 --> 01:55:15,784
“compared 'to 'the pain that
I've been enduring from past 17 years.

1377
01:55:17,444 --> 01:55:21,551
Like hot oil, those words
are still echoing in my ears..

1378
01:55:22,049 --> 01:55:26,862
...where people called my 'father as an
insane and me as an insane man's son.

1379
01:55:29,356 --> 01:55:32,496
Coach sir, I know..

1380
01:55:34,028 --> 01:55:37,475
..my death will surely change things,
because my father used to say..

1381
01:55:38,465 --> 01:55:40,376
..."The level oi your efforts is..

1382
01:55:40,467 --> 01:55:44,040
‘..more or less,
whether it is successful or not.

1383
01:55:44,605 --> 01:55:47,848
...it depends upon your
dedication and determination.'

1384
01:56:42,862 --> 01:56:47,242
Yeah, we won! We won!

1385
01:57:14,761 --> 01:57:16,468
vijav!

1386
01:57:32,546 --> 01:57:35,584
And Vijay.. died.

1387
01:57:37,651 --> 01:57:41,929
Like his father sacrificed,
the same way, Vijay also sacrificed.

1388
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:45,935
You have asked me to talk today,
I will surely talk.

1389
01:57:47,661 --> 01:57:50,665
Because there are very
few moments in 
ife..

1390
01:57:51,698 --> 01:57:56,374
"when a guru is
proud of his disciple.

1391
01:57:57,203 --> 01:58:01,015
Surajbhan Singh is very
proud to have Vijay as his disciple.

1392
01:58:27,667 --> 01:58:32,639
"O beloved."

1393
01:58:34,307 --> 01:58:39,381
"O beloved."

1394
01:58:40,614 --> 01:58:43,185
"O beloved."
- Where are you going, Dinu’?

1395
01:58:45,552 --> 01:58:47,964
Hey, what happened?

1396
01:58:49,056 --> 01:58:53,903
I was“ she is 'the same girl..

1397
01:58:56,196 --> 01:58:59,871
..she is looking for our Vijay.

1398
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,704
What'?

1399
01:59:06,573 --> 01:59:10,487
What were you going 'to 'tell her?
- That our Vijay... - Hey, Dinu.

1400
01:59:21,287 --> 01:59:23,324
When Vijay is alive for us..

1401
01:59:25,292 --> 01:59:26,930
"then why are you
killing him for her’?

1402
01:59:41,007 --> 01:59:44,284
"O my beloved."

1403
01:59:45,145 --> 01:59:48,615
"Hold my hands."

1404
01:59:53,587 --> 01:59:58,093
"O beloved."

1405
02:00:34,194 --> 02:00:36,640
'But you'll stay alone, won't you?'

1406
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:47,378
'Mother, I get peace
after meeting 'father.'

1407
02:01:04,791 --> 02:01:06,828
'Whether this life is
successiul or unsuccessiulu'

1408
02:01:06,926 --> 02:01:12,069
‘..if is based on the efforts
that you do before dying.‘
