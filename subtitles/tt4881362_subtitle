1
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,541
<i>You're carrying garbage from so many days,</i>
<i>and you don't even walk properly.</i>

2
00:00:54,458 --> 00:01:00,000
<i>Your hips sway too much</i>
<i>and you walk weird. </i>

3
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:08,000
Ranganna! Where are you off
with the sickle?

4
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:11,041
Lady, there are no gents in your home?

5
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,958
You take the cows for grazing by yourself,
being a lady.

6
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,541
What's wrong with you.
Go home and sleep.

7
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,833
Back again, huh?

8
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,958
Stop! You rascals don't study
nor graze the livestock.

9
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,000
Stop! Stop!

10
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:39,583
Brats!

11
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,666
What's up, man?

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What's up?

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,833
Where did you leave your wife?

14
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,125
Gave her to someone else?

15
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,666
What will become of you?

16
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,916
You're just a useless bum!

17
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,791
Get lost, boy.

18
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,500
Leave this Village.

19
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,458
It's best that you just leave.

20
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,041
Shopkeeper!

21
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,125
Won't even give me a coffee, eh?

22
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,958
You rascal.

23
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,083
Get lost!

24
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:30,083
Screw you and your mother, won't even give
something to eat or a cup coffee.

25
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,791
I'm getting the hell out of here.

26
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,125
All bloody brats.

27
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,416
What's happened here?

28
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,416
Sir, sir, sir!

29
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,750
Is he not breathing?

30
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,083
Sir? Definitely not breathing.

31
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,666
Somebody please come here. Century Gowda
is not breathing! Come!

32
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,041
He's fallen here! Come fast!

33
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:21,916
Come here.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,916
-What happened?
-He's not breathing.

35
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,333
-Where lady?
-He's fallen here.

36
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,500
-Century Gowda has fallen down!
-Century Gowda?

37
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,958
-Century Gowda?
-Just now I saw him, he wasn't breathing.

38
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,791
-When did this happen, Lady?
-Just now.

39
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,791
Century Gowda is dead.

40
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,083
Hello?

41
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,541
Hello?

42
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,208
What the hell, man?

43
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,625
You said you repaired this motor just
day before, but it's broken again.

44
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:06,458
All other motors are working. Except mine.

45
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:17,041
If I could repair it myself,
why the hell would I call you?

46
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,500
You want me to stick my hand in there
and get electrocuted?

47
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,833
Come today itself and fix it!

48
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,916
What is it?

49
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,500
The motor is not working again.

50
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,458
Okay, I'm coming.

51
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,750
-We'll sell the sand today?
-If they pay hard cash.

52
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,583
It's in high demand, won't unload
unless paid upfront.

53
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,208
Let's finish loading
three carts, fast.

54
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,458
Heard that Sankara got caught by the cops.

55
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,375
Be careful, you may get caught
some day, too.

56
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:42,291
No man can catch me!
I'm too slick to be caught.

57
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:47,375
-It's not like drooling at Chenni's house.
-Really, Abhi? She's one fat bitch.

58
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,625
Dirty people.

59
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,708
Bora, I'll meet you at noon!

60
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,875
Fill that bag with grass.

61
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:58,375
Or your dad will kick you
out of the house.

62
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,583
It's cold.

63
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,416
You said, you'll load six carts.
Let see whether you'll do it.

64
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,625
What?

65
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,833
I'm lifting sand.

66
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:27,916
I'm coming.

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,041
Who'll load the sand to the cart?

68
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,833
-Do you have a beedi?
-Take it from my shirt.

69
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,458
Uncle!

70
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,125
Uncle!

71
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,666
Uncle! Stop! Stop!

72
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,708
What's up?

73
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,666
Your father died!

74
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Who?

75
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,833
-Your father, Century Gowda.
-No worries.

76
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:11,541
-Uncle! He died this morning.
-It's fine

77
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,875
No big deal.

78
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,291
Uncle! Your village is the other way.

79
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,583
Be careful, it might fall off.

80
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,083
Go get the flowers!

81
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,500
Century Gowda has lived
for around 105 years.

82
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,625
Pour water on his head.

83
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,041
Get some more water.

84
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,833
Yes, camphor, incense
and get everything else.

85
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,375
Get lots of flowers, too.

86
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,208
He lived 100 years. He deserves
a great send off.

87
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,333
Okay, okay.

88
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,458
Get puffed rice and some coins.

89
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,625
Pour some water.

90
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,833
Abhi, go and see if there's enough wood
for the funeral.

91
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,916
If not, take few people
and collect some dry wood.

92
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,375
How long do we have
to wait for you guys? Come soon!

93
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,041
Why'd you drop it, you clumsy shit?

94
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,416
You said to hold the bottom.
That's what I did.

95
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Where are you guys? Come fast. You've been
saying "five minutes" for ages.

96
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,708
Hey, where's the funeral?

97
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,333
At your family land,
next to the railway track.

98
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,875
Fine, just get here soon.

99
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,916
Where exactly are you right now?

100
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,541
We're almost there.

101
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,416
Run faster, you stupid fuck!

102
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,125
Get in here useless fellow.
Before I slap your face.

103
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,500
Fucking idiots.

104
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:40,458
Where's Gadappa?
Make sure he comes to the land!

105
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,041
-Carry it.
-I'll take it.

106
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,541
Fine, let him.

107
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,083
Take this.

108
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:02,125
Stack them tight.

109
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,208
His head should face east.

110
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,791
Feet the other way.

111
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,000
A log for his head.

112
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,000
Lift the head.

113
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,458
Cross his legs.

114
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,833
Circle his body thrice, come on.

115
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,666
Wait, but where is Gadappa?

116
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,250
Someone find him!

117
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,083
He's the eldest son. He has to
break the pot and light the fire.

118
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,833
Let one of the others do it.

119
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,750
No way. The eldest son has to do it.

120
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,791
It's hot. Get on with it.

121
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,750
Not a chance. He has to come.

122
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,875
Abhi, see if you can find
your grandfather.

123
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,750
Abhi, I think he went that way.

124
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,041
Come, Bora.

125
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,125
Why are you sitting up here?

126
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,125
They are calling you to do the rituals.

127
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,125
Too much commotion, kid.

128
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,375
I can't stand it.

129
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,916
If you don't come, there'll be
more commotion. Just come.

130
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:07,125
What's the point of rituals now?
Will the dead get to know?

131
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,166
Just come.

132
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,625
Finally, Gadappa is here.

133
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,250
What the hell were you doing?
Everyone is waiting here.

134
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,000
Now remove your shirt!

135
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,291
Don't be a fool. I'm not removing
anything.

136
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,916
Go and bring the pot.

137
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,208
Sons these days, have no respect.

138
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,875
Thamanna, your father wants nothing.
He has quit on life.

139
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,666
Have you got your grandfather's
land into your name?

140
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,750
You know how my father is,
I'm sick of fighting with him.

141
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,541
The land is technically still his.

142
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:03,833
Now with Century dead, if you don't
transfer the land to your name,

143
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,666
or else you will be in trouble.

144
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,458
You are a dumb fellow.

145
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,500
Instead of advising me,
why don't you advice my father.

146
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:15,875
At the funeral, he wouldn't even
remove his shirt for the ritual.

147
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,166
Why would he listen to me?

148
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,333
My fate, if only my idiot father
had co-operated,

149
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,208
the land would've been mine by now.

150
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,791
Century died today,
so I couldn't follow up.

151
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,916
How can I trust you, man?

152
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,083
Understand my troubles. Come tomorrow
and fix the motor.

153
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:58,250
Every three days the motor breaks down.
Put in some original parts, man.

154
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,083
With foreign parts or "London parts"

155
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,333
fix the bloody thing.

156
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,040
First fix my motor. My Sugar cane
is drying out.

157
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,875
Nothing happens over the phone.
Go to town and bring him here.

158
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:20,540
Abhi, don't go to lift sand
tomorrow.

159
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:24,875
The mechanic is coming,
get the motor fixed.

160
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,791
I'm earning money by lifting sand.
Fix the motor yourself.

161
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:33,916
You spend one day lifting sand and
five days loitering with your friends.

162
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,375
What have you earned till now?

163
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,208
At least he brings some money home.
With you, he won't learn anything.

164
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:44,583
What work do you have tomorrow?
Aren't we going to see the astrologer?

165
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,416
-Which astrologer?
-Ramanna.

166
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,500
He's a crook. We'll consult someone else.

167
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,666
You act like you know everything
and want to do it in your own way.

168
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,375
We'll go tomorrow.

169
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,875
Because Century died,
you don't have to cook.

170
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,666
No wonder you're talking so much.

171
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,875
Have you seen my father?

172
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,125
In the morning, he was walking by
the railway track.

173
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,416
He came for tea at 10:00 a.m.

174
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,208
Saw him that day at the funeral.
Haven't seen him since.

175
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,083
Have you kids seen my father?

176
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,791
Tiger didn't come today.

177
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,708
Lady, have you seen my father?

178
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,875
He just went this way.

179
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,041
Father, I really should get you
a cell phone.

180
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,333
-Come. Let's go home.
-There is still time.

181
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:45,833
It's 4:00, I've been searching for you
since morning, haven't even had food.

182
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,708
Why were you searching for me?

183
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,833
Aren't we looking after your needs?
You're always roaming.

184
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,000
Can't you sit around
like other old people?

185
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,250
Instead of dying sitting,
I'd rather die roaming.

186
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,875
Sit, I want to speak with you.

187
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,291
Or else you won't talk?

188
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,416
Father, just stop for a minute.

189
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,125
We have walked too much. At least
walk towards the village.

190
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,958
-There is still time.
-Father!

191
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,541
Father!

192
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,166
What's your problem?

193
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,875
Do that land work with me.
It's important now.

194
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,000
What's there to do?

195
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,000
Do you want your father's land or not?

196
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,583
I don't want it at all.

197
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,083
-But I want it.
-Take it.

198
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,708
You know how it works.
Don't play games with me.

199
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,541
Transfer the land to me officially.

200
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,666
You think I enjoy chasing you?

201
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,958
You roam and we have to come after you.

202
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,166
I'm not stopping you.

203
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,208
Go take it.

204
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Times have changed. Everyone's a thief,
land papers are easily swapped.

205
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:21,083
With Century dead, your brothers will
steal it. They're the biggest thieves.

206
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:25,583
Thieves? Well, I'm old,
when I die, it's all yours.

207
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:31,541
Your father lived 100 years. When will
you die? What if your brothers steal it?

208
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:35,000
Whatever you say. I'm not coming
for any official work.

209
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,041
You drunk fool.

210
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,833
You look like a thief.
You spoil everything.

211
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,958
You are ruining everything
and destroying our piece of mind.

212
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,833
Look at you, walking away like a thief.

213
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,833
You don't care for anything.

214
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,041
Father!

215
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,833
Don't listen to that moron.

216
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,916
Change the gear, you fool.

217
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,791
Here, Bora.

218
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,500
Hey, come fast!

219
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,458
Hey, fat-ass, come with us,
you might lose a little weight.

220
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,875
Keep watch, if you see the forest guards,
blow the whistle. We'll jump in.

221
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,416
Nobody will come, let's go.
If anyone comes, we'll take care of them.

222
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,375
<i>You have won third place,</i>
<i>congratulations.</i>

223
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,958
<i>The next question is,</i>
<i>between the two of you...</i>

224
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,875
A piece of the skull. Take it.

225
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,041
-Here's a knee bone.
-Are you sure?

226
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,416
Definitely a knee bone.

227
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,041
-A leg bone.
-It's too small to be a leg.

228
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:30,625
These bones worked for 101 years,
of course they'll be worn out.

229
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,125
Fine, pick it up.

230
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:52,791
On the coming Thursday, the 27th,

231
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,458
the planets are aligned such that,

232
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,875
on that day, in the morning,

233
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:06,875
from 11:15 am. to 12:15 am,

234
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,666
you need to perform the thithi ceremony.

235
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,500
He lived so well for so long.

236
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,708
Listen carefully.

237
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:19,416
Century Gowda is famous in all
the surrounding villagers.

238
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,416
You need to invite at least 500 people.

239
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:30,833
Importantly, since you are Gowdas,
you have to serve meat at the funeral.

240
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,666
It's good for your family.

241
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,666
Most definitely.

242
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:43,916
The tiles should fit well,
it shouldn't leak again.

243
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,791
Back off man, we know our work.

244
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,750
Why do give us a hard time?

245
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,625
Over here, I can see some gap.

246
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,208
What are you doing up there?

247
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:57,791
Oh! Thamanna! What's up? Go inside.

248
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,208
Come down first.

249
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,791
Some cursed monkeys trampled
and broke the roof.

250
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,250
My wife brought it to my notice,
so getting it repaired.

251
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,791
If it rains, it'll leak.

252
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,708
Come, my roof leaks even more.

253
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,875
If any cement remains, you can take it
and repair your tiles too.

254
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,375
I'm struggling and you're joking.

255
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,791
The person whom I knew at the office
was recently transferred.

256
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,041
No one in that office is honest anyway.

257
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:28,000
For land matters, they'll make you
run around, and milk you for cash.

258
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:31,291
I'm ready to run around, even bribe them.

259
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:34,083
As long as my father isn't needed.

260
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:43,041
Look, all this is a lot of stress on you.
I'll give you a better idea.

261
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,833
I know a rich man. He can get anything
done in seconds.

262
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:51,541
Sell the land to him and
walk away rich. There's no risk at all.

263
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,166
But the land is not registered
under my name. How can I sell it?

264
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,333
But you are meant to inherit it. Right?

265
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,916
Yes, the papers confirm
that I'll inherit it later.

266
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:05,916
That's it. He'll know what to do.
He'll sort things out and buy the land.

267
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:08,458
He's a money man.

268
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:11,458
Hello, brother.
Your wife is coming back.

269
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:20,250
Seems like she's missed her bus.
Out, out, quickly.

270
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:25,208
You lazy bastard, instead of repairing
the roof you're gossiping.

271
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,958
-They're doing it.
-Bullshit! Everyday you have some excuse.

272
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,083
I'm sick of scolding you.

273
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,250
Goddammit.

274
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,000
There are working on it,
it's almost done.

275
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,833
I'm tired of reminding you things,
you never get anything done right.

276
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:37,791
Useless piece of shit.

277
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,625
-Ningi?
-<i>You asshole, where the hell are you?</i>

278
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,458
-What darling?
-<i>Where are you? Just die.</i>

279
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,916
-What happened?
-<i>They broke more tiles than they fixed.</i>

280
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,250
-I'll only come and fix it up.
-<i>Yeah, right, like you are gonna fix it.</i>

281
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,458
I'll only come and fix it,
please calm down.

282
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:16,833
<i>If you don't come now and fix it,</i>
<i>I'll beat you with my slippers.</i>

283
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,000
<i>Fucking useless.</i>

284
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,916
I'll be there in half an hour.

285
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,291
Let's go!

286
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:26,125
Hey, Thamanna, that's the office.
Go and ask for man named Setu.

287
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,000
Hey, just come in for five minutes.

288
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:32,916
If I don't go back urgently,
my wife will kill herself.

289
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,708
Its okay, you carry on.

290
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:35,708
Step on it, man.

291
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:37,500
Hey, douchebag.

292
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:21,333
Sir, someone's come.

293
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:27,875
-What can I do for you?
-I'm here to see Setu Sir.

294
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,208
Coming.

295
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:37,958
Looking for some wood?

296
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,916
No, sir, wanted to talk
about something else.

297
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,916
-From which village?
-Nodekoppalu, sir.

298
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,750
Well, did someone steal your wood?

299
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:50,500
No, sir, I have some land
which I wanted to sell.

300
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:54,291
My business is wood.
Who told you I'd be interested in land?

301
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:57,500
-Shanboga from my village
-Shanboga?

302
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:03,541
My land is 3 km off the main road,
near the railway track.

303
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,166
The road is good too.

304
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,125
-How many acres?
-Around five acres.

305
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:11,958
-Did you bring papers of your land?
-I got it all, sir.

306
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,666
Here you go.

307
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,625
This was my grandfather's land.
Inherited.

308
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,958
Things are not going well. Need money
urgently. That's why I'm selling.

309
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,125
-Your name?
-Thamanna, sir.

310
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,583
-Your grandfather is Channavergowda?
-He's dead.

311
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,833
According to the papers, the land
belongs to your father now.

312
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,166
Bring your father along
and we'll go see your land.

313
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,666
And seal the deal on the same day.

314
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,708
What are you looking at?

315
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:00,208
But my father is dead too.

316
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:01,750
Oh, shit.

317
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,083
So the land hasn't been
transferred to you.

318
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:05,833
Should make new legal
documents now.

319
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:10,541
Now, it's a lot of work to get new
documents done by our officers.

320
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,208
They'll make you run in circles.
Thats a lot of trouble.

321
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,208
Sir, we are village folk
it's hard for us.

322
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:18,041
You are from city and with lot of money.
You can get anything done.

323
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,958
Make a deal, will sign
wherever it's required.

324
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:23,041
You'll sign. But who'll sign
for your father and grandfather?

325
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,625
Do you have your grandfather's
death certificate?

326
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,916
Of course, sir.

327
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,916
And what about your father's
death certificate?

328
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,500
Sir, I'll get them all.

329
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,416
Fine. Get all the certificates.

330
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
We'll see your land and
make the deal there itself.

331
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,583
Your land will be mine
and my money will be yours.

332
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:46,541
Take the suitcase and walk away happy.
I'll take care of everything else.

333
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,875
Okay, sir.

334
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:52,000
What's in for me.
Do whatever you want.

335
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:55,041
It ate our sheep!

336
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,708
We're going to beat you today.

337
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:58,000
You don't know to play well.

338
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,291
Should I play like this?

339
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,583
If you had listened to me,
we'd have won already.

340
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,208
Like, I don't understand the game.

341
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,083
Thats it. It's gone.

342
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,208
Don't eat the sheep.
Give us another chance.

343
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:12,375
Yeah, right. Like he is gonna
give us another chance.

344
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:14,708
When sheep grow fat,
it's better for the tiger.

345
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,958
Wait, guys, I'll make the move.

346
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,708
-Don't move that pawn, man.
-Wait!

347
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:21,166
Nobody is putting up good game.

348
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:25,125
You didn't eat the sheep,
your tiger did.

349
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:28,875
Play, man.

350
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,000
I won't allow you to play.

351
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:31,500
Shut up and allow me to play.

352
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,666
Hey, Kiran, are you still sleeping?

353
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:10,250
<i>I couldn't sleep whole night and was</i>
<i>about to sleep, you disturbed even that.</i>

354
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:13,083
Can I borrow your bike today?
I will also fill the petrol.

355
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,500
Let's go give out funeral cards.

356
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,666
<i>Today itself we are going out to meet</i>
<i>potential brides family for my brother.</i>

357
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,125
Shit, then what do I do now?

358
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,916
<i>Go catch hold of Duma,</i>
<i>his brother has a bike.</i>

359
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:26,375
<i>Make a run for it before Duma's</i>
<i>brother leaves for work.</i>

360
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,541
My great grandfather's dead,
please come for the funeral.

361
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:45,666
Okay.

362
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:51,291
-Please come for the funeral.
-Thamanna's son? You've grown so much.

363
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:54,958
-Sit down, I'll fetch some buttermilk.
-No, thanks. I've had a lot already.

364
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,583
You come once in blue moon,
sit, let me get some butter milk.

365
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,708
Who are you?

366
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,125
I'm Gadappa's grandson.
I came to give funeral cards.

367
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:13,166
Gadappa died? Nobody told me!

368
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:16,583
Not Gadappa! His father,
Century Gowda died.

369
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:23,625
Centrury Gowda, huh? He was a playboy.
He had more women than he could count.

370
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,125
The worst rascal.

371
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,458
Come for the funeral on the 27th.

372
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:33,250
He died? He was such
a strong man physically.

373
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:37,000
Only veggies for lunch or are
we getting some meat served?

374
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,083
-We're cutting sheep.
-Cutting sheep. Good, good!

375
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,375
Two packets of salt, sir.

376
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,458
Two bath soaps.

377
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,208
Anything else?

378
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:05,166
Sir, needed some petrol!

379
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,750
Wait a minute.

380
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,541
-What else?
-A packet of cumin.

381
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:11,916
Packet of salt.

382
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,833
-What else you need?
-Packet of salt. What's the cost?

383
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:16,958
Ten rupees.

384
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:17,958
Two matchboxes.

385
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:25,541
That should do.

386
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,000
Two matchboxes.

387
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,708
And two packets of tea powder.

388
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:37,875
What's the total cost?

389
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:40,875
160 rupees.

390
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,958
As soon as possible, we needed
30 kg of finger millet.

391
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:47,000
People don't sell finger millet
in shops here.

392
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,875
People sell finger millet in homes here,
I'll find out who is selling.

393
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,375
Come back tomorrow with a person
to carry the millet.

394
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,083
This banana is fantastic.

395
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,041
Open the tank.

396
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:08,666
-For how much?
-For 100 rupees, include the banana.

397
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,791
You turned to see me,
I saw you.

398
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,500
Where are you from?

399
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,583
-You turned, right? Now talk to me.
-What's wrong with you?

400
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:09,875
-Why are you coming after me?

401
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:17,958
Have you seen this movie, it's awesome.

402
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:20,041
You're in trouble if my people see you.

403
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,583
What will they do?
Isn't it you, who turned?

404
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,166
I'm telling the truth.
I didn't see.

405
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,291
It's okay, what's your name?

406
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:30,291
Lost your mind? Do you want
a smack on your face?

407
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:44,250
Fucking shit!

408
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:48,750
-Cauvery, why you're so late?
-It takes time to walk, Uncle!

409
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,958
Your mother asked me to check on you.

410
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:00,208
Don't you even know how
to ride a bicycle properly?

411
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:20,666
Madam, is Ramalingu Sir back?

412
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:25,208
Taluk office closes by 5:30. It will take
another hour for him to come.

413
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:26,500
Sit if you want.

414
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,291
-What would you like?
-Tiger brandy.

415
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,333
Tiger, huh?

416
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:10,541
Here you go.

417
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,333
That's him.

418
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,500
What, man? What do you want?

419
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:58,333
Sir, I'm from Nodekoppalu.
I want some help from you.

420
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,291
I've been waiting for an hour.

421
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,625
For my sake or for your sake?

422
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:07,333
For my sake, sir.

423
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,958
Just cut to the point.

424
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,083
Sir, I need a death certificate
for my father.

425
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:31,166
Your father's death certificate?

426
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,041
So why did you come here?
Go to office and apply for it.

427
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:35,125
They'll give it to you.

428
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:39,083
The problem is,
my father is still alive.

429
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,375
What? Your father is still alive?

430
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:43,500
What? Do you know
what you're talking about?

431
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:44,875
Are you kidding me?

432
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,291
Is that even possible?

433
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:50,375
Sir, you have your ways.
I'm stuck in some land problems.

434
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:51,708
Please help me a little.

435
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:55,958
Not little, nor more.
I'll consider this on one condition.

436
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,500
You need to make your father disappear
from the face of the earth?

437
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,875
Can you do that?

438
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:05,625
Sir, take 5,000 rupees as fee,
but please get it done for me.

439
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:14,708
It can't be done for five or ten thousand.
It will cost 25 thousand.

440
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:17,500
Can you pay? Otherwise, get lost.

441
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:18,791
That's a lot, sir.

442
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:26,458
Okay, I'll find a way and pay.
Get it done in around two days, sir.

443
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,958
Do you hear me, 25,000 rupees?

444
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:33,500
Anyway, why do you want
this certificate so badly?

445
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,833
The thing is...

446
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:43,958
Fine, I don't care. Once the job is done,
I want full amount in cash.

447
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,291
But on one condition.

448
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,916
Your father should not be seen after this.
I don't care how you do it.

449
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,250
Don t worry, sir. I ll try and
make sure that it happens.

450
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,083
Not "try". You have
to make him disappear.

451
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,125
And if you breathe a word
of this to anyone

452
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,458
or your father is seen by anyone,

453
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:00,916
I'll make your death certificate.

454
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,083
Be careful. Understood, right?

455
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,125
What's your father's name?

456
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:48,000
Hello?

457
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:51,625
What the hell is wrong with you?
Didn't I tell you there is a lot of work.

458
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,458
Why didn't you let water into sugar cane?

459
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,458
But I'm distributing funeral cards.

460
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,583
There are insects in the sugar cane.
Why didn't you tell me about it?

461
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,375
Where are you now?

462
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,333
Near Hatna.

463
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,250
Bring your grandfather here.

464
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:10,833
<i>Where on the earth can I find him now?</i>

465
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:15,958
I don't care how, just find him.
I'll be waiting at the land.

466
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,041
Shut your ass and do as you're told.

467
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:47,416
I just thought of you and you appeared,
You'll also live a 100 years.

468
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,041
Get on, my dad's calling us.

469
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,166
Get on. Let's go.

470
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,291
Sit tight.

471
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:04,916
-Grandpa, I have a doubt.
-What, kid?

472
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:08,791
-Have you buried some money somewhere?
-Where would I get money?

473
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:12,208
If you have, give it to me. I've found
a chick. I'll ride off with her.

474
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:17,541
You haven't even sprouted a mustache yet.
Who'll run away with you?

475
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:32,583
Get down, man.

476
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:36,583
Father!

477
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,250
Father!

478
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,208
What?

479
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:40,291
Come.

480
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,833
-Did you get your grandpa?
-Yes, I did. Come.

481
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:49,500
We have to search all day
and he finds him in half an hour?

482
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:53,708
Have you seen the sugar cane lately?
They are all dried up.

483
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:59,458
I've channeled water till here.
Irrigate the other side too.

484
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:01,208
You're impossible, boy.

485
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:03,583
Get it done before the power cut.

486
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:15,583
The other day I flared with anger.
Here.

487
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,375
After a lot of thinking,
I've arrived at a decision.

488
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:24,166
Whatever it is.
I'm not going anywhere with you.

489
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,750
Not that. You keep roaming around, right?
About that.

490
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:34,750
You're old now. For years, you've been
saying "I want to travel the country."

491
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:37,375
Why don't you go for a nice
long tour around the country?

492
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:40,250
If you drink this, you can go anywhere.

493
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:44,833
Just kidding, I roam as much as I can.

494
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:47,166
But when I'm around,
you don't have to worry.

495
00:45:47,916 --> 00:45:51,291
I'm serious, fulfill your wish.
Go, travel the country.

496
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,583
The time will come.

497
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,500
Stop. Listen to what I'm saying.

498
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:59,458
If I had money, I would
have gone long ago.

499
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:02,791
If not me, who'll take care of you.
I'll give you the money, go travel.

500
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:04,541
Give, then.

501
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:07,916
If I give you money, you'll just
get drunk.

502
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,958
You should not use that money to drink,
only travel and not waste it.

503
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,750
Give the money, I'll go.

504
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:16,875
First, you have to promise
you'll be gone for at-least six months.

505
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:19,333
Not on me. Abhi!

506
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:22,125
-Abhi! Come fast.
-Coming.

507
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:23,625
Come fast.

508
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:27,708
Fast. Move your ass.

509
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,041
Swear on his life.

510
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,916
Come on, play now.

511
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:15,250
The one in the back.

512
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:30,041
We're here for the finger millet.

513
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,333
Pick a marble quick.

514
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:37,583
That one.

515
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,083
Sir, good afternoon.

516
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,416
Sir, I want some help from you.

517
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,083
What?

518
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,500
Sir, teach me the job
and I'll pay any fees you want.

519
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:10,250
I want to open a mill in my village.

520
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:11,500
Which village?

521
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:12,958
Nodekoppalu

522
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:16,041
There isn't a single mill there,
but plenty of demand for finger millet.

523
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:18,500
My marriage is fixed.

524
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:22,458
As part of my dowry, my father-in-law
is setting up a mill for me.

525
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:27,958
Okay, no need of any fee.
Work here for three months.

526
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,333
You'll learn the job.

527
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:30,791
I'll feed you food thrice a day.

528
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,416
Okay, thanks.

529
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:34,666
Customers have come,
switch on the motor.

530
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:36,625
Did you leave your slippers out, eh?

531
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,916
-What is it?
-Finger millet.

532
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,166
Collect the millet flour
and both of you head back.

533
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,708
I will go to the shop
and come back soon.

534
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,458
Money?

535
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:11,291
Here you go.

536
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:16,583
Should I get some tea?
Is there any hotel nearby?

537
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:22,208
Sure, just go into the village,
somebody will direct you.

538
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,750
And money?

539
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:27,666
It's okay. Anyhow they have to pay
for grinding. Will get in that money.

540
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,750
-How much do they owe?
-For 30 kg, it's 60 rupees.

541
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,958
I don't have change for 100.

542
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:37,833
Don't worry. I'll buy tea in that
money and get the change.

543
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,208
Well, go to the shop with him
and get the change.

544
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,791
And you go along, and get some tea.

545
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:55,458
Cauvery, you're really fond of me, right?

546
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:57,166
That's why you follow me around.

547
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:59,583
Something's is seriously wrong with you.

548
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:02,166
-Then why did you come over here?
-Don't you have some shame?

549
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,333
Don't you have sisters.

550
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:05,458
Of course, I have sisters.

551
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:06,708
I'll tell my people.

552
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:08,916
Tell them, will they eat me alive?

553
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:15,041
Take this funeral card.

554
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,000
My great grandfather was famous.

555
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:18,458
He lived for 101 years.

556
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:25,583
My village is just 6 km from here.
Nodekoppalu, you should come.

557
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,708
Why are you clinging to me, spoiled brat.

558
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:33,958
You're very pretty.
Just one thing is missing.

559
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:37,125
If you pierce your nose
you'll look even prettier.

560
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,666
Gowramma in my village is the best
at piercing, you won't feel a thing.

561
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,125
What, you got pierced yourself?

562
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:44,166
Of course, Look! Here, here.

563
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:59,708
Did you first milk the cow
and then make tea yourself?

564
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,791
It is fresh, so it took time.

565
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,833
Cauvery, what took you so long?

566
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:06,416
-We'll leave.
-Drink tea and then go.

567
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,958
Why would you bring tea for us,
we're already late.

568
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,875
Why did you come so late?

569
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:15,458
Who asked you to bring five tea's?

570
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,208
If you take care of your customers,
they'll come again tomorrow.

571
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,083
Enough, keep quiet.

572
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:23,000
And what time should I come tomorrow?

573
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:24,708
Forget it, boy.

574
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:26,208
Why, is the tea bad?

575
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,000
Enough, you're not required.

576
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:42,291
Anju, how are you?

577
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:47,041
Thamanna, I'm good.
Do you need banana?

578
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:49,500
No, thanks, I'm here to see Kamala.

579
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:52,916
Come here. What's the matter?

580
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:56,583
Do you need any money?
I can lend you some.

581
00:51:56,958 --> 00:52:00,791
Not "some". I need a lot of money.
It's for the funeral.

582
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,125
As you already know she is dangerous.

583
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:06,958
Be careful, or else she will dishonor you
in-front of whole village.

584
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:08,916
Okay.

585
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:23,041
Kamala Sister, how are you?

586
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:28,958
Thamanna, you started drinking too?

587
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:31,416
Or you wanted some Kebab?

588
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:35,916
No, I wanted some help,
wanted to discuss it personally.

589
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,000
Where would I have that kind of money?

590
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,208
Please don't say that.
I'll return it in five days.

591
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,458
I need it for the funeral.

592
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:48,291
Are you gonna spend so much for
the funeral? Can't you manage it?

593
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:51,416
Kamala, this drunk guy
is leaving without paying?

594
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:53,500
Who is that son of a bitch?

595
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:55,041
Stop, you bastard.

596
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,333
Stop, man.

597
00:52:57,041 --> 00:53:00,750
Wait, how can you drink and leave
without paying, you asshole!

598
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:03,458
I deal with men like you everyday!

599
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:04,708
He's done for.

600
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:07,875
If you don't give the money,
I'll beat the life out of you.

601
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:10,333
Will beat the shit out of you,
worthless piece of shit.

602
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:11,791
Give me the money!

603
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:14,958
I'll kick you, son of a bitch.

604
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,958
Bastards are trying to fuck with me?

605
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:22,750
I will squeeze the life out of him.

606
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:26,291
Idiots like him are bad for business.

607
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,541
If he shows his face again,
will show him hell. Freeloaders!

608
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:38,750
-Kamala Sister?
-I don't have that much money. Just leave.

609
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:41,541
Please don't say that.
I'm a man of my word.

610
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,833
Just like everyone I will give
10% interest. Just for five days.

611
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,541
That's fine, but where
will I get two lakhs from?

612
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:52,791
It won't happen. Need to get back,
I have customers.

613
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:57,750
If you want, take higher rate of interest.

614
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,625
Okay, I'll take the risk
and lend you money.

615
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:10,750
But, with 15% interest.
You want it? Think carefully.

616
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:14,291
-Just for five days.
-I don't have so much money. Just go.

617
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,708
It's too high.

618
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,583
Okay, what can I do? I'll take it.

619
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,041
But, you have to repay me on time.

620
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:26,458
If you break your word, I can't beat you.

621
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:28,375
Even if I beat you, wounds heal.

622
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:31,416
I will make sure to dishonor you
in front of whole village.

623
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:34,583
I'll drag your reputation to ground.

624
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,458
Come tomorrow and collect the money
after signing the legal documents.

625
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:48,166
Father, two set of cloths, tooth brush,
tooth paste, a mirror and a comb,

626
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,958
I've packed them all.

627
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:51,416
Are they all new or used ones?

628
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:53,125
They're all good.

629
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:57,125
In an envelope, I've put enough
money for six months of travel.

630
00:54:58,041 --> 00:54:59,083
Check that first.

631
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,250
Check it once.

632
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,250
All right, where will you go first?

633
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:10,666
Whichever bus comes first.
I'll get on it.

634
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:14,333
Wherever that bus takes me, I'll go.

635
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:24,333
Don't break your promise.

636
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,083
Check the money at least once.

637
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:36,708
You may not trust your father,
but I trust my son.

638
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:36,875
-Stop! Stop!
-Why, man?

639
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,666
What's your problem, man.
This isn't a stop.

640
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:45,208
-Just get off faster.
-Is this your father's bus?

641
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:47,041
Go! Go!

642
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,250
One Tiger, please.

643
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:58,416
Here you go.

644
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:34,541
-Give me some tea, ladies.
-Didn't you just have?

645
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,958
Who are you? Why are you sitting here?

646
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,041
I was on a tour, but I missed my bus.

647
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:24,458
I was walking by here.
Saw your camp

648
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:26,541
and thought I'd sit here for a minute.

649
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,583
At this time, in a place like this,

650
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:30,750
what kind of tour were you on?

651
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:32,583
Which village are you from?

652
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,375
I'm from "the-village-I-left" .
Where are you from?

653
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:38,666
We're from Kurdikere in Hubli area.

654
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,250
About 400 km from here.

655
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:42,833
You've come so far?

656
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:48,083
Yes, we keep grazing our sheep
and only return home by first rain.

657
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:51,375
So then you're touring all year long?
Good lifestyle.

658
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:57,958
What's nice about it? Heat, rain and
the cold. Who would want this?

659
00:58:58,041 --> 00:59:00,458
Thats' inevitable.
But a nice journey, right?

660
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,791
I'll also join you guys.

661
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:05,333
Are you kidding?

662
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:09,166
-What's this old man saying?
-He wants to join us.

663
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:15,541
Really? But you're old
and we don't stay in one place.

664
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:18,625
You can't stand our lifestyle,
just go home.

665
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:20,541
What's the old man saying?

666
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:22,375
He wants to join us.

667
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,291
Join us? But who'll take care of him?

668
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:27,291
We're always on the move.

669
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:29,958
I don't need anyone
to take care of me.

670
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,500
I'll take care of myself.

671
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:34,125
I have money with me
for my expenditures.

672
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:37,458
If you just allow me to stay
with you, that's enough.

673
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,416
-Do you drink tea?
-Sure

674
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,791
Then come and have some.

675
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:46,875
-Let's go and you're aged person.
-You're old too.

676
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:46,708
Koinkla, come for dinner,
then call the others who are on watch.

677
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:50,375
Join us for dinner.

678
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,500
That's enough.

679
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:13,750
Please serve some more.

680
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:22,916
That'll do. Thanks.

681
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:30,875
What's your name?

682
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:33,291
Beard man.

683
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:38,041
What? How can your name be "Beard man"?
Were you born with a beard?

684
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,208
What's your real name?

685
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:51,000
Everyone take a good look at their money.

686
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,666
Everyone has paid well.

687
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,708
Getting shit cards, all night.

688
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,833
Throw in the blinds.

689
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:06,250
Call.

690
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,291
-Call.
-I think we'll win.

691
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:11,833
Come on, man, raise.

692
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:15,333
Call.

693
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:22,958
Call.

694
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:27,625
Show.

695
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:29,916
Three eights. A triple.

696
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:31,125
Two kings.

697
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:34,000
Fucking shit. Take it!

698
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:38,416
-Bastard, getting lucky tonight!
-Shut your asses!

699
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:54,916
Grab that sheep.

700
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:04,250
Cauvery, give Gadappa some water
and ask him to come and eat.

701
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:08,791
Put that down.

702
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:12,083
Put that down there.

703
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:16,083
There's porridge and greens curry.

704
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:53,375
Grandfather, you'll be here, right?

705
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,291
Everyone is leaving to graze their sheep.

706
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:57,916
Take this and sleep under a tree.
There's water in the tumbler.

707
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,875
If you want, you can drink. Take this.

708
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:03,750
I don't need this.
I don't sleep during the day.

709
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:05,208
Cauvery!

710
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:07,916
Are you coming out today?

711
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,208
Coming, uncle!

712
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,333
She won't come.
We need her to filter this finger millet.

713
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:14,875
Later we have to collect greens
to make curry for dinner.

714
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,083
Mother, you only do that, I'll go.

715
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:21,541
And who'll do this? You love only
to roam around unnecessarily.

716
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:23,833
What kind of a job is this?

717
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:28,250
-You need me for this stupid job.
-Shut up and strain the finger millet.

718
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:32,416
Mother.

719
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:35,666
Finish your work and come quickly.

720
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:37,166
I'll teach you a game.

721
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:38,875
Okay.

722
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:47,250
Grandpa, you ate a sheep?

723
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:49,541
My tiger is famous.

724
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:04,208
How many sheep do you have?

725
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:06,791
Mine?

726
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,541
One, two, three...

727
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:10,333
-Not the sheep in the game.
-Then?

728
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:12,250
I'm talking about the real sheep
that you own.

729
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:16,833
Everyone has a different number of them,
like, 50, 60, 100...

730
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:18,791
All together we have 1500 sheep.

731
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,833
My uncle has the most. He doesn't sell,
and he keeps hoarding them.

732
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:27,958
Thousand five hundred sheep.
One tiger can eat them all.

733
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:31,416
Oh, you think you can eat them? You think
we sit around eating peanuts all day?

734
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,458
We stay up all night, watching them.
You know?

735
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:48,958
Hey, kids! Did you beat my father
at tiger-sheep game today?

736
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:51,333
He hasn't come to play
the tiger game since two days.

737
01:05:56,250 --> 01:06:00,666
"Greens, greens, greens!"
My husband begs me for these greens.

738
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:06,250
The last time we got greens from Koppa
and cooked. After that we haven't made.

739
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:09,208
That was the last you made,
after that you haven't made?

740
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:12,750
My husband promised me a silk saree
before we go home.

741
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:14,375
I wonder if he'll get it for me.

742
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:21,541
Your husband will buy it
without you even asking.

743
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:27,125
Day before, I saw a saree in Hubli.
It was a nice saree!

744
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,041
Could've bought the saree.

745
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:32,291
Which shop?

746
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,916
What's wrong with you?
I'll scream now!

747
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:38,416
Sure. Scream.

748
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,666
-I'm warning you. I'll really scream.
-Okay, scream. Scream loudly.

749
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:44,083
What's happened to you?
Have you gone mad or what?

750
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,041
You won't scream? Then I will.

751
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:50,333
Have you gone mad?

752
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:54,375
If you like me so much, come speak
to my father. If anyone sees us...

753
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:20,000
Where's that girl gone, sister?

754
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:25,125
Cauvery! Cauvery!

755
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:29,375
I'm coming, Mother.

756
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:33,875
Relax, she will come.
She must have gone to pee.

757
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:35,750
She should at least inform me
before going...

758
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:27,332
Mother.

759
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,582
When did you pierce your nose?

760
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I don't remember, keep quiet.
Why do you want to know now?

761
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:46,707
Around the time I married your father.
I was about 16 years old.

762
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,291
Then get my nose also pierced.

763
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:58,250
Why now? Fine, we'll pierce it.
Now sleep.

764
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:06,291
Look, is the placement okay?

765
01:09:09,332 --> 01:09:10,166
Look.

766
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:17,332
Slowly, please.

767
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:22,957
Slowly.

768
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,500
It's almost done.

769
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:35,332
It's almost done.

770
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:38,291
He'll be here for lunch.

771
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:48,541
Abhi, bring a little at a time.

772
01:09:50,582 --> 01:09:54,333
Tomorrow go and buy three sheep
from the market for the funeral.

773
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,000
You always tell me to do your work.

774
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:58,833
I won't know how to do it.

775
01:09:58,916 --> 01:09:59,875
Do it yourself.

776
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,083
You're the only one working?

777
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:03,666
That means we aren't doing any work?

778
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:05,958
Are we just sitting and eating all day?

779
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:08,083
You know how much work I have?

780
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:12,041
You took a week to give funeral cards,
which only needed just two days!

781
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,500
-Hey.
-What?

782
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:25,208
Your son's grown up. You can't ask him
to do any work anymore.

783
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:31,166
Take the money.
Tell him to buy three sheep tomorrow.

784
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:41,541
Don't play games, boy. I'm not asking you
to do your work. I'm ordering you.

785
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:44,083
You have no other work.

786
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:47,375
Shut your ass and go to market
and buy three sheep.

787
01:10:47,916 --> 01:10:48,958
Don't get the fatties.

788
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:51,333
Buy the ones that are tender.

789
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:53,916
All the surrounding villages
are coming for lunch.

790
01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:58,041
This is a forest.

791
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,333
On a hill, four tigers lives.

792
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:03,875
You have 16 sheep.

793
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:11,750
You have to build a house
to avoid the tiger.

794
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:14,708
In case you build it here,

795
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:18,625
the tiger will jump from here
and eat the sheep.

796
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:22,625
You need to build the house
out of reach of the tiger.

797
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:30,791
-Can we play like this?
-You cannot move this.

798
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:34,541
After all 16 of your sheep have died,
you can build the house

799
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:36,166
and then you can move the sheep.

800
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,958
Bora, you are my best friend.

801
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:58,541
Dude, what about us?

802
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:00,583
I will never ever forget you.

803
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:02,791
But I failed in just one thing.

804
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:06,458
-Hey, fatso.
-But I've still helped you...

805
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:10,333
Hey, guys! What is that?

806
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:16,166
Kulappa, where are you?

807
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,625
<i>Coming to play cards?</i>

808
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:22,250
Bastards cleaned me out last time.
I don't have money.

809
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:24,708
<i>Shit happens. Are you coming or not?</i>

810
01:12:24,791 --> 01:12:26,875
Okay, I will come.
You'll lend me money, right?

811
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:29,125
There's a party going on, why are you
on the phone?

812
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:31,666
The alcohol is still not over, come on.

813
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:37,625
-Give me the phone.
-Shut up and just drink.

814
01:12:44,541 --> 01:12:48,416
Six, seven, eight, nine.

815
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:52,958
Abhi, if you have some money,
please give me.

816
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:55,916
I've spent everything I had on this party.

817
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,916
Anyway, how much did you win
the other day?

818
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:00,750
They are playing with high stakes.

819
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:04,958
I have a chance to win, but I'm broke.
I'll return it in two days time.

820
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:08,416
My father gave me money to buy sheep.

821
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:13,125
But I probably shouldn't touch that.
He'll kill me if he finds out.

822
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:17,708
You need sheep? I'll get you sheep
for a cheap price.

823
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:19,875
We have to win tonight.

824
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:22,000
I have to some how win some money tonight.

825
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:23,333
Bring some of the money, man.

826
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:33,500
<i>Is this dal fry or dal fire?</i>

827
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,375
<i>It's spicy.</i>

828
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:55,208
<i>Please tell me who cooked this?</i>

829
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:57,000
<i>Who cooked this?</i>

830
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:07,041
My mother gave birth to four boys.

831
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:09,708
I'm the eldest.

832
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:16,000
My father was a successful village broker.

833
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:20,541
He was well known in
all the surrounding villages.

834
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:24,416
He made a lot of money as well.

835
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,541
One day, my mother fell sick.

836
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:33,666
We don't know what happened.

837
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:37,958
She dies suddenly.

838
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:40,250
After she died

839
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:45,875
I took care of my little brothers
and the goats.

840
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:48,625
I went on to take care of the family.

841
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:54,458
Once, when my father went out on business

842
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:57,041
when he got back he brought
a girl along with him.

843
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,791
He asked me to marry her.

844
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,666
"I am too young,

845
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:08,208
"I don't want to", I said.

846
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:14,500
My father said, "Even if you cook,
and wash the clothes

847
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:18,708
"there should be at least one girl
to light the lamp."

848
01:15:18,875 --> 01:15:21,416
He forced me to marry her.

849
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:24,625
Her name was Sushila.
I saw her.

850
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,666
I also liked her.

851
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,291
We got married.

852
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:34,625
Two boys were born.

853
01:15:35,041 --> 01:15:37,208
Life went on happily.

854
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:43,291
Just like the way you have sheep.
I used to have goats,

855
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:51,791
and I would get greens for the goat.

856
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:54,291
One day, I took my sickle

857
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:58,833
and went to my field to get some greens.

858
01:15:59,791 --> 01:16:01,166
I went to the sugar cane field.

859
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,916
There, I climbed a tree...

860
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:05,791
I climbed a tree

861
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:07,416
and I bent and looked down.

862
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:11,958
I saw my wife and my father.

863
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:17,583
And I saw what I wasn't supposed to see.

864
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:22,000
Soon enough, my father left.

865
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:25,083
I chopped the tree out of anger.

866
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,625
Hearing the sound,
my wife looked up and saw me.

867
01:16:31,916 --> 01:16:35,791
When she looked up, she didn't
talk a word, neither did I say a word.

868
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:41,541
I came down from the tree
and we went home together.

869
01:16:42,416 --> 01:16:46,666
Once we got back, she cooked dinner.

870
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:49,208
And she served everyone food.

871
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,958
She served me food as well.

872
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:55,166
When she was serving me,
she didn't have the courage to look up.

873
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,333
She didn't talk a word,
neither did I say a word.

874
01:16:59,416 --> 01:17:00,458
We went to bed.

875
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:04,958
Late at night, I heard a sound.

876
01:17:05,916 --> 01:17:09,375
Because of the sound,
I woke up and looked around the house.

877
01:17:13,125 --> 01:17:14,250
I looked around the house.

878
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:16,666
No one was around.

879
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:21,500
So I went and looked behind the house.

880
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:24,583
My wife and children
had fallen into the well.

881
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:29,625
I jumped in and saved one of my sons.

882
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:36,166
My wife and one son were dead.

883
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:45,250
After that I was blank. I didn't
understand anything, I kept quiet.

884
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:51,541
After a few days, I realized
I still have a son to take care of.

885
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:58,625
I did my best and raised him to manhood.

886
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:00,916
I got him married.

887
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:08,083
By that time, my beard had also grown.

888
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:14,708
What was meant to happen, happened.

889
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:18,625
In this life, no one can escape it.

890
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:26,125
So it's better to just be happy
with what we have.

891
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:34,083
All this happened so long ago.

892
01:18:35,166 --> 01:18:36,208
Whether it was real,

893
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:41,500
or just the dream I had last night,
even I don't know.

894
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,291
My 200 is in.

895
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:04,708
You came to hit me with a stone that day.
Let's see if you can hit me today.

896
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:10,000
Fuck this.

897
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,791
Let's see you try to escape now.

898
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:18,000
Call.

899
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:22,791
Abhi, don't play blind. See your cards.

900
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:26,666
This is a game of guts.
I'll win it for sure.

901
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:30,375
This is between them. Stay out of it.

902
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:31,958
Let them play.

903
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:33,416
We'll see how he wins the game.

904
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:38,916
Abhi, if you win this round,
just hold back from playing anymore.

905
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:41,250
Call.

906
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:42,625
Call.

907
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,333
Show.

908
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:57,375
Shit.

909
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,208
My money! The funeral is tomorrow.

910
01:20:17,458 --> 01:20:21,250
You drunk bastard, Kulaiah won it all.

911
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:38,708
Here you go.

912
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:39,916
Madam, is the work done?

913
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:42,625
What work? I don't know anything
about any work.

914
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:44,458
Wait, I'll call him.

915
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:51,583
-What did you say your name is?
-Thamanna from Nodekoppalu.

916
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:55,166
<i>Tell me.</i>

917
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,166
Thamanna from Nodekoppalu is here.

918
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:01,541
<i>I've kept something on the table, give </i>
<i>that to him, and take 25,000 rupees.</i>

919
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,916
Looks like your grandfather
outlived your father.

920
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:24,833
He died recently.

921
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:28,291
Yes, sir, we still haven't done
his funeral. Got to do it soon.

922
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:32,083
But what had happened to your father?

923
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:37,791
He was very sick.
We tried everything to save him.

924
01:21:37,916 --> 01:21:41,541
We spent a fortune on him.
It was of no use.

925
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:44,208
What could we do. It was fate.

926
01:21:54,666 --> 01:21:58,750
Sir, you see the red stone
by the railway track? That's the boundary.

927
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:03,208
Then go up to the small banyan tree,

928
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:07,083
then further up and left
to the big banyan.

929
01:22:07,791 --> 01:22:11,750
Follow these bushes to that coconut tree.

930
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:14,083
Near the cactus?

931
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:16,708
Yes. Then follow the cactus
all the way down.

932
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:18,541
Five acres in all.

933
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,916
There are 30 to 35 valuable trees.

934
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:24,916
Is that your grandfather?

935
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:34,916
Babu! Bring the spade!

936
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,583
Babu, come to the left.

937
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,625
Meaning your left.

938
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:41,666
More, little more.

939
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:44,250
Thamanna! A little left.

940
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,583
Yes, like that.

941
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:51,750
Babu, come a little to your right.
A little more to your right.

942
01:22:52,416 --> 01:22:54,250
Perfect.

943
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:03,083
Sir, I'll put big stones around
the boundary, I'll make it impenetrable.

944
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:07,916
If you had pruned these trees,
they would have grown well.

945
01:23:08,166 --> 01:23:09,666
Sir, I couldn't find anyone for that.

946
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:13,583
Have you shown this land to anyone else?

947
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:18,000
No, sir. Since I'm in trouble,
you are the first one I'm showing it to.

948
01:23:18,541 --> 01:23:20,750
That land next to yours,

949
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:23,208
find out if they'll sell as well.

950
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:27,916
Sir, that land got sold six months ago.
Five lakhs per acre.

951
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,291
Who'll pay five lakhs for land like this?

952
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,541
Talk reasonably.

953
01:23:32,625 --> 01:23:36,458
I'm sure. They sold it six months back
for five lakhs.

954
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:41,250
Your land papers are not legitimate,
and strings have to be pulled.

955
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:46,208
Here's my offer, four lakhs per acre.
That makes 20 lakhs in total.

956
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:50,750
Come to my factory, sign the papers,
and take your 20 lakhs.

957
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:52,375
Why would you want to break your head.

958
01:23:57,208 --> 01:23:59,375
Sir, they want some meat,
so I'll be taking few sheep.

959
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:04,166
-Which one?
-Take any.

960
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:10,958
Dharma! What's wrong with you?
Come out front. I'll give you meat.

961
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:15,333
It's an emergency. I've helped you
so much, at least help me once.

962
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,958
But, Dharma, those aren't my sheep.

963
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:21,958
Don't worry, we'll pay you later.

964
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:32,916
They want these sheep on credit.
They'll pay later, they say.

965
01:24:35,958 --> 01:24:38,500
That's my sheep. Don't touch it!

966
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:54,208
Grandpa, where is Cauvery?

967
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:57,916
She went with the sheep.
She said she'll be back in the evening.

968
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:05,625
The girl just roams around, she has to
pick greens from the field to make curry.

969
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:09,916
Always greens, I'm sick of greens.

970
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:16,250
-Should I wash your clothes?
-There is nothing of mine.

971
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:19,125
Do you all like to eat chicken?

972
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:24,916
Of course, but we only eat it
once a month.

973
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:26,416
Shall we all have tonight?

974
01:25:26,916 --> 01:25:29,500
We will cook the chicken. Will you get it?

975
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:31,541
I will get it.

976
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:33,625
But we'll need someone
to catch the chicken.

977
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:36,583
I don't want anyone. I'll get it myself.
I have money with me.

978
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:39,125
-Will you get it?
-I will surely get it.

979
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,166
-Will you really get it?
-I will really get it.

980
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:44,625
I'll call and ask if it's okay.

981
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:54,583
Hello!

982
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:58,958
<i>Gadappa is offering to buy chicken </i>
<i>for dinner.</i>

983
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:00,666
He'll buy the chicken, huh?

984
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,208
Sure, if he has enough money.

985
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:07,000
Wait, did he bring it up or did you ask?

986
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:09,500
<i>He mentioned it himself.</i>

987
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:13,625
All right, he'll find it difficult
to go himself. I'll send Koinkla there.

988
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:20,083
Koinkla! Your sheep has given birth.

989
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:24,500
Come fast,
you sheep has given birth, come.

990
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:25,750
Where, where?

991
01:26:26,416 --> 01:26:31,875
Gadappa's offered to buy chicken
for dinner. Take the money, buy some fowl.

992
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:36,708
Then, we'll be having porridge
and chicken curry for dinner.

993
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:39,875
Can I get a little alcohol?

994
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:41,708
Only if Gadappa gives enough money for it.

995
01:26:49,916 --> 01:26:54,416
Abhi, who knew the butcher
would fuck us over.

996
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:58,166
There's no point sitting here.
Tell your father.

997
01:26:58,875 --> 01:27:01,916
He might beat you,
but you'll learn something.

998
01:27:02,416 --> 01:27:05,333
You don't know my father,
when it comes to the matters of money.

999
01:27:05,416 --> 01:27:08,750
-You own some sheep, right?
-Don't even think of it!

1000
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:10,458
My father will kill us.

1001
01:27:10,916 --> 01:27:13,250
Why are you'll breaking your head?

1002
01:27:13,541 --> 01:27:16,041
It's just three sheep.
Let's just steal them.

1003
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:21,083
Sure. And if we're caught,
they'll break our legs.

1004
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:25,041
And you're a saint?
Didn't you steal wood with us, too?

1005
01:27:25,333 --> 01:27:29,208
Listen to this guy
and your dad will flatten us.

1006
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:34,750
Come, it's just three sheep,
we'll go steal it from somewhere.

1007
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:39,958
I know what to do.

1008
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:16,833
Even you go and dance.

1009
01:28:20,708 --> 01:28:24,125
Parawwa, bring some onions
for the chicken.

1010
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:30,333
You're sitting here and getting
sloshed on free booze.

1011
01:28:30,541 --> 01:28:32,541
Who's going to watch the sheep?

1012
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:36,708
Shamba! Go watch the sheep.

1013
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:40,916
But you're sitting there jobless.
I'm going to drink and dance all night.

1014
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:23,833
Sit, you fat shit.

1015
01:29:30,041 --> 01:29:31,541
Light it.

1016
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:46,708
You said you'd buy us chicken
and you actually bought it.

1017
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:48,541
Where are you hiding the money?

1018
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:57,375
Gadappa grandpa, I'm speechless!

1019
01:29:58,375 --> 01:30:01,333
You got us meat. You got us alcohol.

1020
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:03,500
You are like god to us.

1021
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:08,333
You are like god.

1022
01:30:30,833 --> 01:30:32,958
Come on, let's go.

1023
01:30:55,875 --> 01:30:57,958
It's already late, go sleep.

1024
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:00,041
-You should go sleep.
-Okay.

1025
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:06,041
-I'll call them tomorrow.
-Okay.

1026
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:03,666
Keep an eye on the veggies.

1027
01:32:07,666 --> 01:32:09,291
Put these masala in here.

1028
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:13,000
This is fat meat. We worked hard
and it paid off.

1029
01:32:13,416 --> 01:32:15,833
It smells good. Give me a piece.

1030
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:17,500
It's not ready yet!

1031
01:32:17,583 --> 01:32:19,083
Just one piece.

1032
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:23,375
Hey, fatty, take it easy or there
won't be anything left for the village.

1033
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:26,875
-Bloody tasty.
-We worked hard, didn't we?

1034
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:31,083
Get these coconuts ground.
Come back fast, you fools.

1035
01:32:37,083 --> 01:32:39,625
Hey! Go slow!

1036
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:41,750
Be careful.

1037
01:32:55,041 --> 01:32:55,958
Thamanna!

1038
01:32:56,958 --> 01:32:58,416
Did Gadappa come here by any chance?

1039
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,083
Where will I go looking for him!

1040
01:33:00,166 --> 01:33:01,625
Then who'll do the rituals?

1041
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:04,458
What is your problem?
Didn't I tell you that I'll do it?

1042
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:06,916
This is a place where dogs lay eggs.

1043
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:18,250
Thamanna, aren't you going
to find your father and get him?

1044
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:22,333
Sure. I'll put an ad in the newspaper.
Mind your business, mother.

1045
01:33:23,208 --> 01:33:25,916
Girl, fetch your
great grandfather's photo.

1046
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:36,833
-Fuck you! The short tailed sheep is mine.
-Don't talk shit. It's mine!

1047
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:38,666
They stole yours!

1048
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:43,166
You're crying over one sheep?
They stole two of my best sheep.

1049
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,208
And that's my fault?

1050
01:33:45,291 --> 01:33:48,541
You want me to sleep
with your sheep tied to my waist?

1051
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:54,750
Listen! Wait a second.

1052
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:57,583
Wait! I know who stole it.

1053
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:00,083
I know who stole it.

1054
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:04,583
He is amongst us now.

1055
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:06,666
This man stole the sheep.

1056
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:10,291
Eat mud, you shameless bastard.

1057
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:13,250
I'll slap you for even thinking it!

1058
01:34:14,708 --> 01:34:19,166
-Have you counted carefully?
-Yes. I've lost two of my best sheep too.

1059
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:21,166
Someone's found the right time
to steal it.

1060
01:34:23,083 --> 01:34:29,333
Stop fighting now. I say we load
the sheep and leave this place.

1061
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:33,791
Thieving has started. It is best to leave.

1062
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:36,166
It will be good if we stay
one more week.

1063
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:41,708
Hey, this is not fair.
You are not doing the right thing here!

1064
01:34:47,541 --> 01:34:49,041
Ningi, give me some.

1065
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:51,500
You need more than this to fix your face.

1066
01:34:52,791 --> 01:34:54,583
How is it that
you're coming with me today?

1067
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:56,916
Take it.

1068
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:10,875
Kamala, it's late. Everyone's left
for the funeral.

1069
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:14,625
What is the hurry? Just wait!

1070
01:35:19,583 --> 01:35:22,708
The funeral is done with my money.
How can they start without me?

1071
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,041
Hey, Ravi, there's meat for lunch.
People will find their way.

1072
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:28,750
It's already late. Let's leave.

1073
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:30,541
Let a few more get in.

1074
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:33,541
-More people means less meat for us.
-All right, all right.

1075
01:36:07,541 --> 01:36:11,083
-So much money?
-Your sheep were stolen, right? Keep it.

1076
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:12,333
No, I don't want, grandpa.

1077
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:16,500
-Where did you get so much money from?
-Keep it.

1078
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:22,375
Why?

1079
01:36:22,458 --> 01:36:23,541
For you. Take it.

1080
01:36:24,666 --> 01:36:25,500
For me?

1081
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:28,625
-For me?
-Yes, take it. It's for you.

1082
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:30,250
-Really?
-Really.

1083
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:41,375
Take this for your sheep.

1084
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:44,583
What's this? But someone else stole
the sheep. Why are you paying for it?

1085
01:36:45,083 --> 01:36:46,000
It's fine, take it.

1086
01:36:46,833 --> 01:36:48,541
Losing two sheep won't make me poor.

1087
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:49,833
It's okay.

1088
01:36:49,916 --> 01:36:51,958
-I insist.
-No.

1089
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:05,500
Three fat sheep are on the menu.

1090
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:09,958
The faster you fools work,
the sooner we feast.

1091
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:11,958
Yes, like that!

1092
01:37:30,041 --> 01:37:32,375
I'm busy, I'll speak to you
in the evening.

1093
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:35,958
Saitu is inside.

1094
01:37:36,916 --> 01:37:41,666
Hello, Umesh. Hello, Satish.
Hello, Nagraj. Come, let's go.

1095
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:48,583
It's a 20 or 25 minutes journey.

1096
01:37:48,666 --> 01:37:52,250
A right on the main road
and 3 km in,

1097
01:37:52,375 --> 01:37:55,666
you'll find a railway gate.
The land is next to that.

1098
01:38:22,958 --> 01:38:25,000
Bora, get me a bucket of water!

1099
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:29,625
He's making us to work like hell.

1100
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:38,500
The shepherds are leaving,
probably because of us.

1101
01:38:39,958 --> 01:38:42,500
-You sure it's the same shepherds?
-Seems like it.

1102
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:44,333
Keep pouring the water,
I'll be back soon.

1103
01:38:56,708 --> 01:38:58,750
Hey, Abhi, wait, even I'll come
for the funeral.

1104
01:38:58,875 --> 01:38:59,958
Hey!

1105
01:39:03,791 --> 01:39:05,541
Someone get the banana leaf.

1106
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:09,083
Rajanna, come, spread the banana leaf.

1107
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:11,625
Get the chair and the photograph
and keep it there.

1108
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:17,291
Spread the banana leaf.

1109
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:19,666
Will good happen to the village
if you do this?

1110
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,458
Take it and place it over there.

1111
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:22,916
Food is ready.

1112
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:26,875
Place it over other side. Enough.
Yes, right.

1113
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:28,958
Place one on this side too.

1114
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:32,000
Yeah, place it over there.

1115
01:39:36,208 --> 01:39:38,250
Stop, you fools!

1116
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:41,541
Do you know nothing about our traditions?

1117
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:44,500
Does no one care Gadappa is missing?

1118
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:51,833
I've told this guy a million times
to lock him up.

1119
01:39:51,916 --> 01:39:53,291
Do you think they'll listen to me?

1120
01:39:53,375 --> 01:39:55,000
What work has he done properly?

1121
01:39:55,083 --> 01:39:58,375
And this fool went bald
as though he himself is Century's son.

1122
01:39:59,166 --> 01:40:00,833
You all only care about who is missing.

1123
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:03,708
I've spent money on this function.
So, I'll do the rituals too.

1124
01:40:04,333 --> 01:40:06,083
What deed Century Gowda had done

1125
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:10,041
that his eldest son
doesn't go bald for him?

1126
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:12,541
Thamanna is taking care
of all the things.

1127
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:14,166
Why did that stupid fucker go bald?

1128
01:40:14,458 --> 01:40:18,083
The other brothers
should take over instead.

1129
01:40:18,166 --> 01:40:21,083
Anyone would go bald
if I gave them a right to property.

1130
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:22,625
Then you go bald too.

1131
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:24,250
-I should go bald?
-Yes.

1132
01:40:24,625 --> 01:40:26,375
If you give me property even I'll go bald.

1133
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:23,541
All go in line and place it there.

1134
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:25,958
Pour water a little bit more.

1135
01:41:26,125 --> 01:41:28,583
-Give me some water.
-There is no water.

1136
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:32,250
I'm sick of this ceremony.
No water, even.

1137
01:41:32,416 --> 01:41:35,916
Why are you crying for water! It's just
water. I'll fetch it, just keep quiet!

1138
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,166
Fetch it then!

1139
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:39,916
Go soon and fetch the water.

1140
01:41:59,541 --> 01:42:02,875
-Gadappa is the eldest son...
-Can you please keep quiet.

1141
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:04,291
Any one of you'll...

1142
01:42:04,416 --> 01:42:08,208
Thamanna, where are you going?
You have to finish the rituals!

1143
01:42:08,333 --> 01:42:10,791
I'll be back in a minute.
Let her fetch the water.

1144
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:13,208
So many people have come.
Is this the way you respect them?

1145
01:42:13,291 --> 01:42:15,000
Come, boy, it's important.

1146
01:42:16,291 --> 01:42:18,666
One, two, three, four...

1147
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,458
-Go quickly and buy four soft drinks.
-Give me money.

1148
01:42:23,708 --> 01:42:25,208
Go. Come back soon.

1149
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:35,208
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

1150
01:42:35,416 --> 01:42:38,875
You said, you'll be coming tomorrow,
so, I was going to come tomorrow.

1151
01:42:38,958 --> 01:42:44,666
My friends wanted to see the land.
Even I was free so I got them.

1152
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,291
Go do your work. I won't trouble you.
We'll leave.

1153
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:51,458
Hello, sir.
Hello. Hello. Hello.

1154
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:53,500
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

1155
01:42:54,833 --> 01:42:58,875
Sir, I've sent for soft drinks. He will
come any minute. Sir, are you well?

1156
01:42:59,125 --> 01:43:02,541
I'm fine. How are you?
You're wearing a new coat.

1157
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:08,541
Thamanna! You can talk later!
Come finish the rituals. Come soon.

1158
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:12,083
They're calling you.
Go finish your work. We'll leave.

1159
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:16,333
I sent him when I saw you all,
he should be here any minute.

1160
01:43:16,541 --> 01:43:19,291
You must drink and have lunch, too,
and only then leave, sir.

1161
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:22,666
We can't stay for lunch, we have no time,
we have to go elsewhere.

1162
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:24,000
Sir, sir...

1163
01:43:24,541 --> 01:43:28,333
Why are you pestering them?
They are not jobless like you.

1164
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,500
They are big people.
They have important commitments.

1165
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:37,625
Thamanna, you don't understand
these things. You go back.

1166
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:40,000
I'll take care of things here.
Don't worry.

1167
01:43:40,791 --> 01:43:43,833
Please go ahead. We'll leave.

1168
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:51,375
Negotiations are done.
Don't say anything.

1169
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:57,000
Sir, he will be here any time now.

1170
01:43:57,541 --> 01:43:59,208
He'll be here any time.

1171
01:44:32,875 --> 01:44:36,458
Could that be Gadappa?

1172
01:44:42,416 --> 01:44:43,458
I think it's Gadappa.

1173
01:44:44,416 --> 01:44:45,750
Oh, my! It is him.

1174
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:50,458
Come here, everyone!
Stop the rituals! Stop the rituals!

1175
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:54,500
Gadappa is here! Come! Come!

1176
01:44:57,125 --> 01:45:02,416
-Run fast.
-Gadappa! Come honour your father.

1177
01:45:03,416 --> 01:45:05,583
If you don't, who else will?

1178
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:09,791
-Why are they running?
-They are going to bring the eldest son.

1179
01:45:09,916 --> 01:45:11,500
He's running away.

1180
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:12,416
Run!

1181
01:45:12,708 --> 01:45:13,708
Run fast!

1182
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:17,166
Run, run!
Wake up! Wake up!

1183
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:23,750
Gadappa, come on
and do the rituals.

1184
01:45:23,833 --> 01:45:26,333
If you don't do the ritual
then who else will do it?

1185
01:45:33,041 --> 01:45:37,041
Where's Gadappa? I don't see him here.

1186
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:42,625
He was walking right here.
I saw him with my own eyes.

1187
01:45:42,708 --> 01:45:45,583
Why are you amidst our sheep?
What do you want?

1188
01:45:46,166 --> 01:45:47,541
They don't seem to know anything.

1189
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:51,041
Trust me. I don't lie!

1190
01:45:51,375 --> 01:45:53,125
Wasn't he coming with you?

1191
01:45:53,208 --> 01:45:54,916
-Who was coming?
-Gadappa!

1192
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,083
There is definitely no Gadappa here.

1193
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:02,375
Beard man is from our village.
We need him for something.

1194
01:46:02,458 --> 01:46:06,541
We have no beard man
or moustache man with us.

1195
01:46:06,791 --> 01:46:10,041
What a headache! Where has he gone?

1196
01:46:10,125 --> 01:46:15,041
Trust me! I don't lie.
I saw him with my own eyes.

1197
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:16,333
Leave it, it's okay.

1198
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:56,791
I found Gadappa! I found Gadappa!

1199
01:47:16,375 --> 01:47:18,666
Gadappa! What's going on?

1200
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:22,041
Didn't I tell you?
This is my village.

1201
01:47:22,458 --> 01:47:25,166
My father died and I'm the eldest son.

1202
01:47:25,666 --> 01:47:27,500
They are taking me
to do the funeral ceremony.

1203
01:47:28,208 --> 01:47:30,250
Shit! We should have
taken a different route.

1204
01:47:30,333 --> 01:47:33,500
It's for the best.
We anyway haven't cooked.

1205
01:47:34,791 --> 01:47:38,833
We'll have lunch together and leave.
I'll come too.

1206
01:47:39,083 --> 01:47:40,708
That's my grandfather!

1207
01:47:40,791 --> 01:47:44,416
Gadappa is your grandfather?
Why did he join us?

1208
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:48,708
He joined you?
Why didn't you tell me?

1209
01:47:48,791 --> 01:47:51,458
Was I supposed to dream
that he is your grandfather?

1210
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:03,916
-Nagraj, what's going on there?
-Why are they carrying him like that?

1211
01:48:04,916 --> 01:48:07,375
Who is that?
Why are they carrying him like that?

1212
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,166
Sir, it's a long story! Century Gowda's
eldest son hadn't come for the ceremony.

1213
01:48:12,791 --> 01:48:16,666
He's supposed to lead the ceremony,
but they only just found him.

1214
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:35,500
Isn't Century Gowda's eldest son
Thamanna's father?

1215
01:48:35,708 --> 01:48:36,833
Yes, sir.

1216
01:48:37,625 --> 01:48:40,791
What are you saying?
He died in 2010.

1217
01:48:40,875 --> 01:48:43,000
No, sir! That's him there.

1218
01:49:02,958 --> 01:49:04,833
Get lost, brats!

1219
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:13,041
That's enough. You'll can leave.

1220
01:49:13,208 --> 01:49:14,208
Put him down.

1221
01:49:14,416 --> 01:49:15,500
Put him down carefully.

1222
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:18,208
What the hell is wrong with you?

1223
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:20,833
What have you done?
Anyway, come perform the rituals.

1224
01:49:20,916 --> 01:49:23,750
Finish the rituals soon.
Thank god, we at least found him now.

1225
01:49:24,125 --> 01:49:28,416
Instead of coming for your father's
funeral, what on earth were you doing?

1226
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:31,458
At least he's here now.
Let's get done with rituals, soon.

1227
01:49:31,541 --> 01:49:33,541
Let's get on with it, people are hungry.

1228
01:49:33,625 --> 01:49:35,208
Let's perform the ritual now.

1229
01:49:36,041 --> 01:49:39,625
It's his duty to perform the rituals.

1230
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:42,875
Okay, dude, let's get on with it.

1231
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,458
People are getting fried in the sun.

1232
01:49:44,541 --> 01:49:46,041
-I'm doing it.
-Okay, do it.

1233
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:50,166
Hey, Thamanna, Setu is calling you.

1234
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:54,250
I have to do the ceremony.
Tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.

1235
01:49:54,333 --> 01:49:58,791
Gadappa is here, we don't
need you anymore. You can get lost!

1236
01:49:59,291 --> 01:50:01,500
You can get going. Get going.

1237
01:50:01,708 --> 01:50:03,166
Let's find out what he wants.

1238
01:50:06,041 --> 01:50:09,333
Pour the milk one by one.

1239
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,916
-Did the ceremony go off well?
-It's happening.

1240
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:23,666
My friends have accepted this land.

1241
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:25,125
They've liked it a lot.

1242
01:50:25,375 --> 01:50:26,833
It's excellent land, they say.

1243
01:50:27,583 --> 01:50:30,041
We've closed the deal,
so why wait for tomorrow?

1244
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,583
Babu, give me the suitcase.

1245
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:36,125
Sir, today's the funeral.
I'll come tomorrow.

1246
01:50:37,833 --> 01:50:41,041
Why tomorrow?
The money is here anyway.

1247
01:50:41,541 --> 01:50:43,875
Your father's funeral
or your grandfather's funeral?

1248
01:50:44,125 --> 01:50:46,458
I'll do your funeral, son of a bitch.

1249
01:50:46,666 --> 01:50:48,875
What do you think of yourself?
What is this?

1250
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:52,166
You think you can duplicate
government papers?

1251
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:54,833
Would any bastard do this to their father?

1252
01:50:56,458 --> 01:50:57,666
Take the papers and die!

1253
01:50:59,291 --> 01:51:01,666
You don't get anything for free.

1254
01:51:01,791 --> 01:51:05,000
I took you for a decent village man.

1255
01:51:05,083 --> 01:51:06,958
Now I got to know what kind
of a person he is!

1256
01:51:08,291 --> 01:51:09,291
Bloody fool!

1257
01:51:23,708 --> 01:51:26,666
If you had shaved your head
I would have been satisfied.

1258
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:28,958
-Do it slowly.
-Okay, perform the rituals now.

1259
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:33,750
Get the things ready for the rituals.

1260
01:51:33,958 --> 01:51:36,958
Get camphor, incense...

1261
01:51:37,833 --> 01:51:38,666
Father.

1262
01:51:40,791 --> 01:51:43,333
I didn't come myself.
They picked me up and brought me.

1263
01:51:43,875 --> 01:51:45,208
Give back the money I gave you.

1264
01:51:46,291 --> 01:51:47,416
I'll leave after this.

1265
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:53,833
Don't play games. You broke your word.
Give back my money.

1266
01:51:53,958 --> 01:51:56,583
I spent it all. I don't have it.
I'll leave.

1267
01:51:56,791 --> 01:51:58,500
You've destroyed my life!

1268
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:02,125
I struggled and made a deal.

1269
01:52:04,458 --> 01:52:08,291
Any idea where I got the money from?
And you swore on my son!

1270
01:52:08,375 --> 01:52:10,250
Thamanna, just leave it!

1271
01:52:10,333 --> 01:52:13,000
You better give the money.

1272
01:52:13,583 --> 01:52:15,500
-If not...
-Leave it, Thamanna.

1273
01:52:15,791 --> 01:52:19,000
Otherwise, see what I'll do to you!

1274
01:52:19,083 --> 01:52:20,541
Leave him.

1275
01:52:20,625 --> 01:52:23,500
Thamanna, why are you behaving
like this? What the hell's wrong with you?

1276
01:52:23,583 --> 01:52:25,416
He's a thief! A thief!

1277
01:52:26,625 --> 01:52:29,083
-He's a thief.
-Everyone is watching.

1278
01:52:29,166 --> 01:52:32,875
We have to take a decision. Either I have
to live or you have to live on this earth.

1279
01:52:32,958 --> 01:52:34,333
Solve the matter at home.

1280
01:52:34,416 --> 01:52:37,125
I was going to get millions tomorrow!
He spoiled everything!

1281
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:38,708
He betrayed me.

1282
01:52:38,791 --> 01:52:42,791
Settle down the matters at home.

1283
01:52:42,958 --> 01:52:45,500
-Please stand there.
-I need to talk to Thamanna.

1284
01:52:45,583 --> 01:52:46,958
I'll talk to him, you stay here.

1285
01:52:48,458 --> 01:52:52,250
Thamanna, Kamala has something important
to talk to you about.

1286
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:55,583
You bastard! You're like a frog
that can't stop croaking!

1287
01:52:55,666 --> 01:52:58,250
You stood there sucking their cocks!

1288
01:52:58,416 --> 01:53:01,625
"Stay! Don't leave!"
Eat mud and die, motherfucker.

1289
01:53:02,291 --> 01:53:03,833
Get lost, Shanboga.

1290
01:53:03,916 --> 01:53:05,791
He's other one.

1291
01:53:06,583 --> 01:53:08,625
Hey, Thamanna!

1292
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:11,750
Give me the money and I'll spare you!

1293
01:53:11,833 --> 01:53:15,208
-The decision has to be made here.
-You please leave, we'll do it tomorrow.

1294
01:53:15,291 --> 01:53:19,166
-No! I'll expose him right now!
-This is not the place!

1295
01:53:20,708 --> 01:53:22,791
-What happened?
-I have no idea.

1296
01:53:22,875 --> 01:53:26,458
You have no idea?
You said I'll get the land when you die!

1297
01:53:26,541 --> 01:53:28,666
I'll pick up a stone
and kill you right here!

1298
01:53:28,750 --> 01:53:32,375
I'll do your funeral today!

1299
01:53:32,708 --> 01:53:34,000
What do you think of yourself?

1300
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:36,583
You wait and watch!

1301
01:53:36,666 --> 01:53:38,083
Enough, enough. Let's go.

1302
01:53:38,375 --> 01:53:41,625
-Let's go. Okay, let's go.
-He's a thief!

1303
01:53:42,125 --> 01:53:44,041
Take him home.

1304
01:53:44,625 --> 01:53:47,000
He's a thief! He has no shame!

1305
01:53:47,208 --> 01:53:48,541
Father, what's wrong with you?

1306
01:53:48,625 --> 01:53:51,416
He ruined everything!

1307
01:53:52,666 --> 01:53:55,208
Give the ceremony items soon.

1308
01:53:55,541 --> 01:53:57,125
Come this way.

1309
01:53:58,041 --> 01:54:01,708
I've never seen such a funeral
before in my life.

1310
01:54:01,791 --> 01:54:04,166
Why do we have to perform this funeral
with such difficulty?

1311
01:54:04,291 --> 01:54:08,333
Your son has lost face in front
of a dozen villages.

1312
01:54:09,416 --> 01:54:11,166
That too over such petty shit!

1313
01:54:13,541 --> 01:54:16,958
-How many sheep did they cut?
-No idea, this a different village.

1314
01:54:17,125 --> 01:54:19,708
What the hell! Where's our food?

1315
01:54:20,166 --> 01:54:22,166
Be patient, man!

1316
01:54:22,916 --> 01:54:25,291
We called you for food,
we'll definitely feed you.

1317
01:54:25,416 --> 01:54:27,625
Be quiet for a while.
Let us get done with ceremony.

1318
01:54:30,375 --> 01:54:34,083
Mahadeva, take these people
for lunch and serve them.

1319
01:54:34,166 --> 01:54:36,833
Give them the leaf and serve them food.
We will come in a while.

1320
01:54:37,125 --> 01:54:40,125
Whoever wants can head for lunch.

1321
01:54:40,541 --> 01:54:41,916
Everyone head for lunch.

1322
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,666
The first batch will be served right away.

1323
01:54:43,958 --> 01:54:45,125
Everybody go for lunch!

1324
01:54:45,333 --> 01:54:46,791
Walk towards the village.

1325
01:54:57,166 --> 01:54:59,958
Father, I'll go for lunch?

1326
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:03,125
You should've gone with the others.

1327
01:55:03,875 --> 01:55:04,875
Go, if you're hungry.

1328
01:55:04,958 --> 01:55:08,083
Otherwise, we can go together
when the others come.

1329
01:55:08,166 --> 01:55:09,083
No, I'll go now.

1330
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,333
What can I say? Go ahead.

1331
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:22,166
What's up, Dharma?

1332
01:56:26,958 --> 01:56:28,166
Has everyone come for lunch?

1333
01:56:30,208 --> 01:56:31,458
Keep serving. I'll come.

1334
01:56:34,625 --> 01:56:36,291
I stepped into the village for a minute.

1335
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:38,750
Okay.

1336
01:57:08,583 --> 01:57:10,916
I don't know where I'll be.
Find me and marry me.

1337
01:57:28,333 --> 01:57:30,458
-The meat is superb!
-Really good.

1338
01:57:37,833 --> 01:57:42,041
-Eat well, friend.
-You too.

1339
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:51,583
It's worth attending this funeral.

1340
01:57:51,666 --> 01:57:52,875
They've served some good food.

1341
01:57:52,958 --> 01:57:54,083
This meat's amazing.

1342
01:58:27,833 --> 01:58:28,833
A little louder.

1343
01:58:32,208 --> 01:58:33,375
Enough.

1344
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:53,291
<i>Our Century Gowda</i>

1345
01:58:53,666 --> 01:58:56,708
<i>passed away exactly 11 days ago.</i>

1346
01:58:56,791 --> 01:58:58,166
Yes!

1347
01:58:58,250 --> 01:59:01,583
<i>In this village called Nodekoppalu.</i>

1348
01:59:02,583 --> 01:59:04,208
<i>His family members</i>

1349
01:59:05,125 --> 01:59:06,958
<i>for the entertainment of the village</i>

1350
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,375
