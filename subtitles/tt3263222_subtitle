Neuro surgeons have
predicted Hari's death shortly

28
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,274
If that is true
I want this baby

29
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:45,279
As someone to live for
the rest of my life

30
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:50,580
But if a miracle happens
and Hari outlives his illness

31
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:59,348
If Hari escapes from his fate
as his old Anuradha, I will live with him

32
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,441
Everything depends
on his condition

33
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,481
Whatever it is, I must know
as soon as possible

34
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:09,106
Before the fetus in my womb
becomes a baby

35

Giving up 35 years of life as a nun
Sr Jasmine Jennifer made headlines last week

42
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:58,338
Now she has announced
that she is 7 months pregnant

43
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,611
Pregnant and a virgin, this can
create news as well as controversies

44
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:07,615
Sr Jasmine Jennifer is here
to share this with us

45
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,045
Let's go meet her first

46
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,476
Did you check the volume?

47
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,111
- Hi ma'am
- Please sit

48
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,202
Go ahead, ask

49
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,747
Why this sudden desire at this age?

50
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,771
This might stir up a controversy
How do you view this, sister?

51
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:44,206
I did not renounce my nun's habit
to get married or have a family

52
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:47,446
I don't desire that even now

53
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:52,676
Neither will I say a woman finds herself
complete only after becoming a mother

54
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,777
But I personally feel
that is correct now

55
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,073
This is an entirely personal view
Whether right or wrong

56
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:06,116
Sr Jennifer's journey to this fulfillment
was assisted by Dr Zakharia

57
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:09,740
He is on line now
We'll ask him directly

58
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:13,439
Hello?

59
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,740
Dr Zakharia

60
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:18,377
How did you accept this challenge?

61
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,375
Challenge?
This is an entrustment my dear

62
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,142
Artificial methods to pregnancy
has been popular since long

63
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:30,578
Rig ht in my hospital
Under my treatment too

64
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:33,978
Being a nun Sister came into limelight

65
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:37,344
A 52 year woman
who renounced her status as a nun

66
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,506
There could be protests
from her people as well as society

67
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:45,448
But as a doctor her age factor
is my only point of concern

68
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:51,640
Since it was artificial insemination
chances were more for an abortion

69
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,048
I did not renounce my robes
to get married or have a family

70
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:01,774
This will only be considered
as a challenge to God and society

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,981
Believers will never accept this

72
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:08,708
Virgin Mary was a virgin
Didn't she also conceive?

73
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:11,247
Even though society ostracized her

74
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,146
Later it was that child
who saved the world...Jesus

75
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:19,214
'This was the second problem
disturbing our doctor'

76
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,407
'What was to be highly secretive
was being celebrated and touted...'

77
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:27,540
'...by media and society
Sr Jasmine Jennifer's pregnancy'

78
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:33,139
'Cameras following her pregnancy
Controversies giving rise debates'

79
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,373
'Creating an uproar in its aftermath'

80
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:40,541
'Caught between the devil and deep sea
how will he deliver her baby peacefully?'

81
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:55,480
'Susan Mary, the doctor's wife'

82
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:59,206
'More than 20 years of marital life'

83
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:07,479
'This couple, prove that age
need not dim feelings of romance'

84
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:49,046
In the movie Lady Chatterley's lover...

85
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,574
...there is a scene where the hero
makes love to his girl in a meadow

86
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:58,443
Witnessed by the birds and animals

87
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,449
The same anxiety and expectation
is reflected in that dove's eyes too

88
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,474
I have not come for consulting you

89
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:46,776
But as you guess, I am pregnant
past 3 months

90
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:56,011
I don't want an abortion

91
00:11:56,433 --> 00:12:00,609
Without affecting my education and future
I want to give birth to this baby

92
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:06,982
I am prepared to give this baby away
to any childless family willing to adopt it

93
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:11,675
I've come to find out
if you can help me find such a couple

94
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:17,037
I will come with my parents
to meet you again

95
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,239
I have only one condition

96
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:25,276
No one should ask me
who is responsible for this

97
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:45,612
'Those moments of romance
with Susan...'

98
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,442
'...rudely interrupted by this
young girl, Saira'

99
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,681
'...who, so casually talked about
such an important event of life'

100
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:58,512
'That 17 year old was
this doctors 3rd problem'

101
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,206
Cheers!

102
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:33,545
I was thinking
Why not adopt that baby?

103
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:54,008
'A person who delivered hundreds of babies
Dr Zakharia's fate too was strange'

104
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,279
'It may sound fictitious...'

105
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:02,648
'...that this loving couple were
not lucky enough to have a child'

106
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,742
'People came seeking
his help for a baby...'

107
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,074
'...while his own fate
was like a riddle'

108
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,175
'Just when he thought their lineage
had come to a dead end...'

109
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:21,184
'...she walked in with a pregnancy
that held no one responsible'

110
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,371
'Saira-

111
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,470
<i>SR'?</i>

112
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:06,537
Are you leaving?

113
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,206
Yes, I have kept
your breakfast on the table

114
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:13,113
I wanted some money
I want to buy a pair of shoes

115
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,147
Isn't that why you fleeced
Rs 300 from me yesterday

116
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,204
Where will you get
Adidas shoe for 300?

117
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:20,338
Get something
for what you have

118
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,006
Are you planning to strut around
like the boys here in Kochi?

119
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:25,741
They are all big people
Remember that

120
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,213
Look at my shoe and then talk
I'll show it to you

121
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:32,476
Where the hell is it now?

122
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,305
What the hell is this my boy?

123
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,711
Don't forget you are a big boy now

124
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:41,338
Why don't you wear a pant
that will not show your under wear?

125
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,380
Will it not be seen
when you go out?

126
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,276
Just give me some money

127
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,437
Just Rs 200 more

128
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,344
We get duplicate ones at the boat jetty
I want to buy a pair from there

129
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,380
Don't you understand
what I am saying?

130
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,208
We don't have parents, right?

131
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:55,008
So we have to live carefully

132
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:02,112
I will wait for 2 more days
After that I know what to do

133
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:08,004
Hey! 2 weeks and it will be 2 months
I have got only the advance so far

134
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,011
Rent?

135
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:13,516
I have just got a job,
don't you know that?

136
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,014
When I get my salary,
I can pay you for 2 months, right?

137
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,174
Hey man! Come herel say!

138
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,342
I don't want to make you
do all this, sister

139
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,606
But your pressure level is a little high

140
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:31,705
If it has to reduce by delivery time
you have to put in effort now itself

141
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:36,546
Then I will practice here
for longer periods

142
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,171
That is not necessary

143
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:42,771
Strenuous exercises might
lead to chances of abortion

144
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,614
Hey! Nothing will happen
We'll pray for good things to happen

145
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,413
Careful

146
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:00,639
Look at him gaping!

147
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,408
Won't you spare pregnant women?
Aren't you too old for this?

148
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:04,377
What is it?

149
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:08,279
Anybody would think it she
became pregnant because I stared at her

150
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,212
Please go

151
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,243
Haven't all staff come yet?

152
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,576
No female staff is here
during the breathing classes

153
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,977
Where is that new girl?
Has she not come yet?

154
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,173
Must have come now
and changing into her uniform

155
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:32,610
Changing, my foot!

156
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:52,341
- 5000
- Good morning

157
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:56,108
- 8000, 12000, this is how
- I'll be right back

158
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:58,340
These are the tests
you will have to undergo

159
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,177
Hey! Fathima

160
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:06,704
I sawyou rushing into the bus

161
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,373
I was waiting there
so we could travel together

162
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,444
Where were you?

163
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,035
I missed that bus

164
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,306
I got myself a lift
on Robin's bike to reach here

165
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:16,243
ls that so?

166
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,311
What?

167
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,010
I asked if that was so?

168
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,505
When important therapy...

169
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,671
When an important
therapy is going on...

170
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,771
...without attending, you can't
just walk in as you please

171
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:43,015
Signal blocks and traffic jams
That's why I was late

172
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:45,069
What a strange city this is!

173
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,334
What?

174
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:47,434
I meant to say...

175
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:49,137
Don't talk stupidly

176
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,245
Come to my cabin

177
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,370
Who does he think he is?

178
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:00,606
In my town there is Dr Adam

179
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,375
When he calls my name
ants start crawling

180
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,707
Such sweetness, eh?

181
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,781
So what?
At least we have freed om

182
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,779
Here is a hospital like a resort
A gynecologist who is mad

183
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,707
And to top it all
with a stupid beard

184
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:21,111
He has asked me
to go to his cabin

185
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:23,340
Now what will I do, oh my saints!?

186
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,573
No use calling the saints

187
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:28,273
He doesn't care
about anyone in this world

188
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,576
But pregnant ladies
are a weakness

189
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,270
He has set aside
all his care for them

190
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,676
Now go meet him

191
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:48,011
I am not bothered whether
you give me due respect or not

192
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:53,312
We don't follow the usual concept of
a big hospital filled with patients

193
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,710
Service is very important
They deserve that

194
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:58,043
People like you
must understand that

195
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,509
Sorry doctor
I did it by mistake

196
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:03,013
Did it by mistake!
Idiot!

197
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,743
Anyway you can do
night shift for some days

198
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:14,176
Doctor how can I?
Doctorl am...

199
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,577
He doesn't care
about anyone in this world

200
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:22,080
But pregnant ladies
are a weakness

201
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:25,646
He has set aside
all his kindness for them

202
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:38,176
Doctor I can't come for night shift

203
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:40,744
I am carrying

204
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:44,007
What?

205
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:45,774
I am pregnant

206
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,174
Why are you looking at me?

207
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,073
I have not touched her

208
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,970
Are you married?

209
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:55,541
He is in Dubai

210
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,078
How many months?

211
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:59,340
Past 2 months

212
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,706
You have to be careful

213
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:15,042
This is the time you need rest

214
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:16,737
Don't worry

215
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:18,577
Go

216
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,376
'Fathima who pretended
to be pregnant...'

217
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:37,676
'...was here as recipient of
Doctor's kindness and care'

218
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:42,306
'Fathima's pregnancy
had become his 4th problem...'

219
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:45,177
'...which he himself
had no clue about'

220
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,637
We stay 20 km interior from Kasargod

221
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,011
Mulleria
Behind the government hospital

222
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:58,243
Not in a house
Just a small tent covered in plastic sheet

223
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:01,576
I have a younger brother, lkku
Iqbal

224
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,741
When he was born, dad disowned him
Faked a passport and ran away to Dubai

225
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,144
He did not come back, the rascal

226
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,146
Mother was a cleaner in the hospital

227
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,444
She used to help Koya'kka prepare
biriyani for weddings on Sundays

228
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:21,613
Struggling like this
she sent me to do my nursing

229
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:25,036
Last year she died

230
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,011
How did you get married?

231
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:34,071
The people from
the mosque proposed him

232
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:37,241
He was with me
only for 3 months

233
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,442
Peculiar fellow
I had some gold with me

234
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,411
He ran away with that

235
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:46,241
But didn't you tell the doctor
he was in Dubai?

236
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,380
Of course, that's what
we must tell such people

237
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:53,073
Why tell everything to everybody?

238
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:55,204
Didn't you try to search him out?

239
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,574
Idid

240
00:24:56,767 --> 00:25:00,681
But I found he gets married
in every town he visits

241
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,510
What is his name?

242
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,706
Kad er

243
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,341
ls he from Madayi?

244
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:12,004
No, he is from a different place

245
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:13,512
Place?

246
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,444
I meant from a different town

247
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,413
Well who is the Kader
you were talking about?

248
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:23,279
When I was young
I had a friend in school

249
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:26,577
She was Fathima
Very pretty like you

250
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:34,041
After her 12th grade
Madayi Kader married her

251
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:38,281
I thought he had come back
So I asked

252
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:41,414
I am going
That head nurse will come now

253
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,538
Tea

254
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,573
Sir, tea

255
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,705
You may adopt her baby

256
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,044
But we have
3 more daughters younger to her

257
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:18,108
She wants to give birth, eh?
A 17 year old mother

258
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,780
No
lam 18

259
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:27,607
Did you see her arrogance?
Can she not tell us who it is?

260
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,442
At least for bringing her up
for so many years

261
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:43,312
Tell me my child
ls it one of your friends?

262
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:50,412
Religion, caste nothing is an issue
ls it a married guy?

263
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,443
Hey you!

264
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,775
Doctor please make her understand
She need not tell us who it was

265
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:31,180
An abortion
It's for the good of all

266
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:33,747
Hers as well as all others

267
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:41,446
Why are you silent?
Don't you have anything to say?

268
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:43,036
What can I say?

269
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,141
Sure, what can you say?
Mothers have to take care of girls

270
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,411
Mr Varghese, this problem
can't be solved shouting and blaming

271
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,673
I have explained
everything at the hospital

272
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,111
Abortion is not
practical at this stage

273
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,147
This child is carrying
a 4 month old fetus

274
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:05,511
No gynec will perform
an abortion at this stage

275
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,478
Because she's too young

276
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,978
Then let us all
consume some poison

277
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,050
Like we discussed and if you agree
let Saira come stay in my house

278
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:21,115
Susan and I are there
to look after her needs

279
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,202
And she will get
all the care she needs now

280
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,713
Look, this is the best way
to avoid people from knowing

281
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:30,514
You can come anytime and visit her

282
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,075
'Hello Anu'

283
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:49,578
'Why don't you
answer my calls?'

284
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:51,613
'I told you I'll come
as soon as possible'

285
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:56,374
'I've been wanting to call
ever since you told me'

286
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:58,674
'I will reach Kochi tomorrow'

287
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,603
'Dr Sharath is a friend'

288
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,408
'No one will know
We will go there'

289
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,010
You mean abortion?

290
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,137
'Yes! There isn't
any other solution, is there?'

291
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,645
'How long can you hide it?'

292
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:14,681
'Not only that, if you don't
it's the biggest punishment you give Hari'

293
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:19,273
I know, you want to marry that girl
your family got you betrothed to

294
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:22,371
Even though secret lovers
always wash their hands off

295
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:25,243
Women like me still
keep falling in their traps

296
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:28,645
- But there is business
- What?

297
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,207
Hari will die any of these days
What I want now is a baby from Hari

298
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,405
The sole inheritor of Hari's wealth

299
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,138
'Anu what are you trying to say?'

300
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,543
You can decide

301
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:45,377
If you stick with me
you will lose your love

302
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:48,505
But instead you will
enjoy 3 benefits

303
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:57,782
A life with me, your own baby
and Hari's wealth for the rest of our life

304
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,435
<i>'Hello'</i>

305
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:13,378

Come here please

306
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,376
Where are you?

307
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:25,605
Sam had called
from Bangalore

308
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:34,208
Dr Cherian Philip
is coming from America

309
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:37,244
To a hospital here

310
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:39,671
Did you know?

311
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:46,242
Sam without telling us
had mailed my medical reports to him

312
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:51,206
Dr has conveyed
a wish to meet me too

313
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:56,640
The Doctor is a distant
relative of Sam's fiancee

314
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,309
I have also heard about him
I've heard he is extremely brilliant

315
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,637
Everything will be fine

316
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:14,577
I too feel hopeful now

317
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,047
I am confused
What is you plan, Sam?

318
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:35,569
Speak up, Sam!

319
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:41,413

Nor do I want Hari's wealth'

A lullaby, a melody in sorrow“

349
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:33,348
"Filling the heart to brim,
like a song sung to a little one"

350
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:43,253
"Was it a beautiful rhythm
Dear one, as I waited to see you again?"

351
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:50,316

Faces seen, different every time"

354
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:50,349
Sevy, I am feeling very ill
Can you come here please?

355
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:54,344
You brought it up on yourself
Now go ahead and go through it

356
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:55,538
Hell!

357
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:20,373
Mother! I have not sinned

358
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:26,477
Don't forsake me, please

359
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,978
Sister!

360
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:49,477
Doctor! I am-

361
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:52,173
What happened?

362
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:55,972
lam in pain

363
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,272
I'll come there right away

364
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:05,607
No, I am already in the car
I'll come to the hospital myself

365
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,377
Doctor please

366
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:19,677
Doctor she has lost fluid

367
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,647
Doctor, I have...

368
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:29,474
Come on, it's nothing

369
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:32,446
I have a request

370
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:42,352
Whether it is death or not
it must be the same for both of us

371
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:48,445
Don't be upset
Be brave, nothing will happen

372
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:36,633
'When the umbilical cord is cut and angels
above showered their divine blessings'

373
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:50,446
'Like the herd of sheep in a valley
She called out from her big generous heart'

00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,672
Samuel

375
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:56,071
The one, I begged
the Lord to give me

376
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:59,538
He does not call these days, does he?

377
00:42:59,634 --> 00:43:01,614
If he does call, let me know

378
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,476
Stand right there
Give me Rs 100

379
00:43:04,534 --> 00:43:05,342
Why?

380
00:43:05,434 --> 00:43:09,109
That sister delivered
Have you forgotten the wager?

381
00:43:09,234 --> 00:43:11,077
A baby b°V

382
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,044
How were you so accurate?

383
00:43:14,267 --> 00:43:19,376
My dear fellow, I can accurately predict
looking at the belly whether boy or girl

384
00:43:19,434 --> 00:43:21,539
Do you want to bet on this lady?

385
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,102
Yes, I bet

386
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,334
Come!

387
00:43:26,267 --> 00:43:27,302
Com e?!

388
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:32,205
This nun is a real celebrity

389
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:35,737
Even Shwetha menon (film actor)
did not create such an uproar, isn't it?

390
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,574
Watch and see

391
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:40,104
Sr Jasmine's delivery
will be today's breaking news

392
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:45,340
Finally after controversies and protests
A nun, Sr Jasmine Joseph delivered

393
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:52,147
It was at 4:30 early this morning
We have her brother here with us

394
00:43:55,334 --> 00:43:58,110
Tell us, how do you view this event?

395
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:05,247
This is an issue no doubt because
she always took decisions all by herself

396
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:11,583
When we wanted her to get married
she wanted to become the Lords bride

397
00:44:11,634 --> 00:44:13,238
Like that she became a nun

398
00:44:13,534 --> 00:44:17,676
Later she denounced her vows
and wanted to become a mother

399
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:23,182
I heard she drove all alone
to the hospital and delivered

400
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:25,342
We were all against this

401
00:44:25,434 --> 00:44:30,577
But whatever the objections
we were there if she wanted us, right?

402
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:36,473
Everything is heradamancy
What else can I say!

403
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,977
Take the camera and come

404
00:44:50,467 --> 00:44:53,414
Doctor, we heard
Jasmine Joseph delivered

405
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,275
Can we shoot some visuals?

406
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:57,177
Sorry it's difficult now

407
00:44:57,267 --> 00:45:00,680
The newborn and mother
are under observation

408
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:02,337
Come after a couple of days

409
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,506
And if they are willing
You can shoot

410
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,310
Delivery and its after math
are their private decisions

411
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:12,711
I have limitations

412
00:46:48,634 --> 00:46:51,513
It is obvious the medications are working

413
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:57,482
The infection in the spinal nerve
that has been completely cured

414
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,415
You can say it's a new life
You can say he is back among the living

415
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:08,380
You must continue
with physiotherapy

416
00:47:09,134 --> 00:47:13,514
Maximum 2 months
You'll be walking like before

417
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:17,504
You go back to your motor racing
Just like your favorite Schumacher

418
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,640
You must give him
courage and self confidence

419
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:25,713
Love and peace of mind

420
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:28,204
That will boost his confidence

421
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,742
It is as important
as the medicines, okay?

422
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:44,638
'I am not confused any more'

423
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:50,311
'I am able to decipher
that Hari should live'

424
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:54,648
'Nothing must come
between us here after'

425
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,738
'If there is, it must be destroyed'

426
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:17,684
If the fetus is not developing normally
or in case the mother is seriously ill

427
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:24,651
Or where pregnancy was due to rape
There are reasons to perform abortions

428
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:31,481
4-8 week old pregnancy
can be medically terminated by oral pills

429
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:38,075
8-12 is done by surgical termination
Like you sawjust now, a cleaning process

430
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,243
Many such methods

431
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:48,410
It is quite shocking
the way some of it is done

432
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:54,038
'I am not confused any more'

433
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,209
I understand your helplessness

434
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,615
Your lover has deserted you
Your husband is coming back to normal life

435
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:09,378
This is your scan report

436
00:49:09,534 --> 00:49:18,215
Even if you decide to abort elsewhere
It is not one life you will be destroying

437
00:49:21,434 --> 00:49:24,972
You have twins in your womb

438
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:36,640
Whatever the problems you face
However severe they are

439
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:41,216
You are scrapping away
2 lives from your womb

440
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,714
It is not a question of law alone
There is also the humane factor here

441
00:49:48,533 --> 00:49:49,705
Think about it

442
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,747
What is all this my girl?
Have you forgotten what the doctor said?

443
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,777
All this is bad for you
This is the time to be extremely careful

444
00:50:44,534 --> 00:50:46,605
Where are you going?
Take your medicine

445
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:50,171
I don't want it
Do you know how bitter it is?

446
00:50:50,267 --> 00:50:53,271
Please don't say that
Do as you are told

447
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,070
I am like your mother, am I not?

448
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:01,171
Only 'like' a mother
Not my mother right?

449
00:51:01,734 --> 00:51:08,151
My mother has not loved me
So, no need for you also to do so, aunty

450
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,340
Hey! You are impossible
Don't be stubborn my child

451
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,473
Be a good girl and eat this
Remember what doctor uncle told you?

452
00:51:52,534 --> 00:51:53,569
Saira?

453
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:55,602
My child?

454
00:52:15,234 --> 00:52:16,338
Saira?!

455
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,104
What is this?

456
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:22,543
Acigarette
Smoking

457
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,976
Have you started
this habit also at this age?

458
00:52:25,034 --> 00:52:26,274
You are girl!

459
00:52:26,367 --> 00:52:28,608
Why? Don't girls have
a right to smoke?

460
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,010
Usually they don't

461
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:35,205
Who told you
lam the usual girl

462
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:39,680
Do girls usually
of my age be pregnant?

463
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:43,510
Enough! Always a back answer
and negative attitude

464
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,972
No wonder!

465
00:52:56,033 --> 00:52:57,205
Saira?

466
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:02,646
Do you what you are doing
is harmful to your body?

467
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,004
It affects the baby
growing within you

468
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:08,206
Whatever you eat
will go to the baby too

469
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:12,738
Your attitude and thoughts
will affect the baby's nature too

470
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:15,206
So that is the issue

471
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,543
I knew it!
Selfish people

472
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,645
Bastard!

473
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:29,547
No! Saira!

474
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,308
What are you doing?

475
00:53:39,734 --> 00:53:41,475
Are you mad?

476
00:53:41,567 --> 00:53:44,741
Leave me alone

477
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:51,374
I hate every one
All of you

478
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:54,240
<i>Chew!</i>

479
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:04,973
Saira, my child
Open the door

480
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,643
I blame only you

481
00:54:33,634 --> 00:54:37,480
As Masters degree
holder in social work...

482
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,974
...you should have shown her
the pity you would to a social animal

483
00:54:42,234 --> 00:54:46,478
Consider her age,
her mental state in this situation

484
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:51,343
She is only showing
she is bold in her talk and actions

485
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:57,380
There is an ocean
of emotions raging inside her

486
00:55:00,134 --> 00:55:04,207
Do you know which
is the most precious kiss on earth?

487
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:12,009
Not the first kiss of a boy
on the lips of his lover

488
00:55:12,634 --> 00:55:17,515
Nor the last kiss of a widow
on the lips of her dead husband

489
00:55:19,034 --> 00:55:24,609
But the feather like kiss
a mother gives her sleeping child

490
00:55:32,767 --> 00:55:36,544
Why don't you giver that, Susan?

491
00:55:43,634 --> 00:55:46,137
She is your baby's mother, isn't she?

492
00:56:28,534 --> 00:56:30,741
I'm really sorry dear

493
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:42,308
I'm sorry too

494
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,140
In that moment of anger

495
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:55,235
Are you angry with me?

496
00:56:56,134 --> 00:57:00,048
You are not aunty
Didn't you say you are my mother?

497
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:05,247
I was the one who did wrong

498
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,007
I hated everyone

499
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:10,637
I will listen to you hereafter

500
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,112
To everything
this mother of mine tells me

501
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,140
What happened?

502
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,543
He kicks

503
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,013
Let me touch?

504
00:57:44,634 --> 00:57:46,580
I don't feel anything

505
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:50,774
Why don't you talk?
He will hear you

506
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,438
Hi baby
This is me

507
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,501
Your mom

508
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,074
We are all waiting for you
my sweet angel

509
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:15,112
We love you
Come soon

510
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:34,048
I felt it
It was magical

511
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:19,671
Don't you want to know
if it's a boy or a girl?

512
00:59:19,767 --> 00:59:21,144
No

513
00:59:21,234 --> 00:59:22,372
Sure?

514
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:28,640
No way dear

515
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,144
What is that constantly moving?

516
00:59:33,467 --> 00:59:36,971
That is the baby's heart beat

517
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,340
I'll show you

518
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:17,246
'I slowly recognized
the changes happening in me'

519
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:21,777
'Many nights I wake up

Fathima

548

Come here, I must
tell you something

01:04:58,634 --> 01:04:59,738
What is it?

550
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,747
I went to the bank yesterday
Vasantha told me the good news

551
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,510
This is not meant to be hidden

552
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:22,575
We know each other since 3-4 months
Yet you didn't think it fit to tell me?

553
01:05:22,634 --> 01:05:24,204
I did not...

554
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:25,712
How many months now?

555
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:27,337
5

556
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,640
You must be careful

557
01:05:28,734 --> 01:05:31,010
Vasantha will look after everything

558
01:05:31,067 --> 01:05:33,638
She's an expert
in deliveries

559
01:05:33,734 --> 01:05:36,408
When will your hubby
return from Dubai?

560
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,481
He'll be very happy, hm?

561
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:42,377
I did tell him
But he won't get leave

562
01:05:42,434 --> 01:05:44,277
He'll come next year

563
01:05:44,367 --> 01:05:48,338
Afather must also have luck
to see his new born child

564
01:05:52,734 --> 01:05:56,272
I have not paid the rent
I'll give it next month okay?

565
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:58,313
Oh! Forget it!

566
01:05:58,367 --> 01:06:00,506
You must have many expenses

567
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,013
When your husband sends
the money you can pay it

568
01:06:04,234 --> 01:06:07,681
Look here, don't go to her
here after to collect rent

569
01:06:07,767 --> 01:06:09,542
She is carrying

570
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,635
She will bring it here
as and when it's possible

571
01:06:12,434 --> 01:06:15,540
It's time for me to go
Can I leave?

572
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,170
Poor girl

573
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:22,340
Fathima be careful
I'll visit you often

Fathima

575
01:06:36,767 --> 01:06:39,543
Don't run around with this belly

576
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:42,240
Already I am late
My work is in the delivery room

577
01:06:42,334 --> 01:06:44,746
Give it to me
I will go there

578
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,711
Go sit at the OP

579
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,711
lf doctor comes to know
I'll be in trouble

580
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,577
Doctor himself instructed
To give you a job where you can sit

581
01:06:52,667 --> 01:06:55,204
Doctor gave this to me

582
01:06:55,267 --> 01:06:59,238
Vitamin tablets
to be given to Fathima

583
01:06:59,467 --> 01:07:02,346
He asked if you had
undergone all the tests

584
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:06,473
He said if you go there
he'll check up

585
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,705
Go have a cup of coffee
and take rest at the OP

586
01:07:19,734 --> 01:07:22,715
I forgot to give it to you this morning

587
01:07:26,567 --> 01:07:28,308
Mangoes in brine

588
01:07:30,033 --> 01:07:31,034
Hey! Aju?!

589
01:07:31,367 --> 01:07:34,075
It will be a wee bit more sour

590
01:07:37,567 --> 01:07:40,571
Take it Fathima
My mother gave it

591
01:07:40,634 --> 01:07:42,443
It's great to eat during this period

592
01:07:45,434 --> 01:07:47,971
I have duty
Let me go

593
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:50,337
My dear son

594
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:53,278
You are nurturing
someone else's baby

595
01:07:54,267 --> 01:07:57,476
What does it matter?
Its all for Fathima, isn't it?

596
01:08:00,767 --> 01:08:05,341
As kids, I have sat with Fathima
under the mango tree...

597
01:08:05,434 --> 01:08:08,244
...and eaten so many
raw mangoes

598
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,605
Fathima?
lkku?

599
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:30,271
What is it?

600
01:08:30,334 --> 01:08:31,642
Where is your sister, my boy?

601
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,271
Not yet come back from hospital
I too am waiting for her

602
01:08:34,334 --> 01:08:36,371
Will you give this to her
when she comes?

603
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,438
What is it?

604
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:43,105
I got it made
especially for your sister

605
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,544
A medicine for pregnant women

606
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,047
After dinner every night
Ask her to drink an ounce

607
01:08:51,134 --> 01:08:53,774
Its very sweet
Made in honey

608
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,638

611
01:09:03,767 --> 01:09:06,145
Allopathic medicines are of no use

612
01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:09,408
Ayurvedic medicines only
will help in easy delivery

613
01:09:10,334 --> 01:09:11,779
Ikku

614
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:16,410
Don't forget to give it to her
Don't drink it up yourself

Yes lkku

616
01:09:26,267 --> 01:09:28,178

617
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:32,111
Tell me, are you pregnant?

618
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,612
Are you mad?
Be quiet!

619
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,476
The landlady told me
you were carrying

620
01:09:37,567 --> 01:09:39,774
She's even given you
a medicine to have at night

621
01:09:40,034 --> 01:09:42,412
I am not carrying
She's saying it all for fun

622
01:09:42,467 --> 01:09:44,447
Will you tell me
the truth or not?

623
01:09:44,534 --> 01:09:49,210
Be quiet, I'm in a bus
I'll come there and explain

624
01:10:49,434 --> 01:10:52,677
What is that?
A stomach with air?

625
01:10:57,067 --> 01:10:58,603
What is that?
Show it to me

626
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,203
- Don't come here
- I want to see what it is?

627
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,041
I'll beat you to pulp
if you come here

628
01:11:03,101 --> 01:11:04,637
- No!
- Let me see

629
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,009
No!

630
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:44,444
Stay away!

631
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,706
What is this?
Why do you tie it on your tummy?

632
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,212
Isn't this an air pillow?

633
01:11:57,434 --> 01:11:59,345
Some things can't be explained lkku

634
01:12:01,134 --> 01:12:03,671
lfl don't go around like this
everything will be in a mess

Anyway we have
to be here for 6-7 months

We have many benefits
out of this lkku

01:12:16,434 --> 01:12:19,074
Land lady won't press for rent money

639
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:21,408
Hospital won't complain if I'm late

640
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,508
Everybody takes good care of me

641
01:12:25,167 --> 01:12:27,613
Don't deny me all this lkku, please?

642
01:12:29,101 --> 01:12:31,103
So you are actually not pregnant?

643

No

644
01:12:34,467 --> 01:12:37,175
Must be someone from downstairs
Shouldn't you tie this?

645
01:12:39,367 --> 01:12:40,539
I'll blow it up for you

646
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:59,377

My place in heaven will be assured

about my state

690
01:18:19,634 --> 01:18:22,046
See, I'm perfectly okay

691
01:18:23,767 --> 01:18:26,077
This is not the time to be sad

692
01:18:26,767 --> 01:18:28,542
You better take rest

693
01:18:29,467 --> 01:18:31,777
That is the best
for your condition now

694
01:18:35,634 --> 01:18:42,108
I know what you have been
trying to hide, since some time

695
01:18:44,101 --> 01:18:50,211
Even if you cover it up
Your body will not

696
01:18:53,101 --> 01:18:55,980
A union with a huge
difference in ages

697
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:01,577
My immense wealth was
the attraction your father saw

698
01:19:03,234 --> 01:19:07,512
But you later understood
that I possessed only wealth

699
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:15,176
I had lost the ability
to satisfy a woman long ago

700
01:19:15,467 --> 01:19:17,469
lam an impotent rich man

701
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:28,583
Yet my aim was not to have
a beautiful wife to show off

702
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:34,341
I loved you with all my heart

703
01:19:35,467 --> 01:19:37,140
I really love you

704
01:19:41,634 --> 01:19:45,138
I am not asking who it is
You don't have to tell

705
01:19:45,234 --> 01:19:50,149
But I can only say that
it will not lessen my love for you

706
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:55,510
lam a person trying
to fight death and come back to life

707
01:19:56,034 --> 01:20:02,315
I have already learnt
to take things lightly

708
01:20:34,567 --> 01:20:36,103
ls the doctor there?

709
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:37,168
Doctor is asleep

710
01:20:37,234 --> 01:20:38,235
Please give it to him

711
01:21:02,334 --> 01:21:05,110
Please give it to doctor
Its very urgent

712
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,271
I told you doctor was asleep

713
01:21:49,434 --> 01:21:54,008
The calling bell just rang
Someone's come I think

714
01:22:13,367 --> 01:22:15,973
Oh it was you
What is it Narayana?

715
01:22:16,434 --> 01:22:20,211
We tried calling you
Both mobile and the land line

716
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,177
We could not get in touch

717
01:22:22,267 --> 01:22:26,044
Land phone is working
What is the matter?

718
01:22:26,134 --> 01:22:29,115
Sr Jasmine's baby developed
breathing problems and...

719
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:32,205
...was brought to the hospital
It's a bit severe

720
01:22:32,434 --> 01:22:34,141
Isn't the duty doctor there?

721
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:38,171
Duty doctor asked me to call you
That's why I called

722
01:22:38,334 --> 01:22:42,373
When you were not reachable
I was asked to come and fetch you

723
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,209
Wait, I'll come right now

724
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,209
You are too late doctor

725
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:29,511
They were here since the last hour
We have been trying you ever since

726
01:23:29,601 --> 01:23:32,377
When we didn't get a response
we sent Narayan'ettan

727
01:23:32,467 --> 01:23:33,537
By then

728
01:23:42,734 --> 01:23:47,547
I told her we'll go to
another pediatrician

729
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,309
But she insisted on seeing you

730
01:23:53,334 --> 01:23:58,249
Even though we were unhappy
We'd just begun to accept and love him

731
01:23:58,634 --> 01:24:00,170
Now...!

732
01:24:01,567 --> 01:24:03,137
Sister?

733
01:24:26,267 --> 01:24:27,575
I am sorry

734
01:24:44,634 --> 01:24:50,209
I have never slept
away from him even once

735
01:24:53,134 --> 01:24:55,273
I had a slight fever

736
01:24:56,467 --> 01:24:59,107
To prevent him from catching it

737
01:24:59,767 --> 01:25:01,576
I put him in the cradle

738
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:08,477
When I heard a noise
I went to see

739
01:25:10,334 --> 01:25:13,645
My baby was
gasping for breath

740
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:37,041
My son!

741
01:25:50,167 --> 01:25:53,774
Maybe God did not wish
that I have that baby

742
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,309
If you had got this slap
some time back...

743
01:27:39,367 --> 01:27:41,643
...you would not be here
with this swollen belly

744
01:27:45,567 --> 01:27:48,173
Asmall baby lost its life
because of you

745
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:51,480
A baby born to a mother
in her old age

746
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:54,441
Her sorrowful moans
are ringing in my ears

747
01:28:02,201 --> 01:28:05,011
Loafing around with
boyfriends till midnight

748
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,740
Enjoying carnal pleasures
in whatever secluded places available

749
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:12,249
Adolescent kids like you won't
understand that mother's sorrow

750
01:28:16,067 --> 01:28:19,139
There are hospitals
to perform abortions

751
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,204
Hi tech orphanages
to bring up such orphans

752
01:28:22,334 --> 01:28:25,213
Or other homes
to abandon the baby

753
01:28:30,767 --> 01:28:33,771
Remember, you will also
bear a child tomorrow

754
01:28:34,001 --> 01:28:35,139
Become a mother

755
01:28:36,067 --> 01:28:39,708
Pray that you don't be cursed
by a shattered mother

756
01:28:40,734 --> 01:28:43,442
Pray that the soul of a child
who choked to death...

757
01:28:43,534 --> 01:28:46,105
...did not hunt you down

758
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:38,475
Aju'kka

759
01:29:38,567 --> 01:29:39,705
What is this for?

760
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,212
This is for your sister
to use in the toilet

761
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:42,778
How is it?

762
01:29:43,034 --> 01:29:46,038
God! It's great
Can I also use it?

763
01:29:46,101 --> 01:29:48,741
It's not for you
Hey! It will break

764
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,505
Get up

765
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,012
This is too good

766
01:29:52,067 --> 01:29:53,637
This will help you
crap nicely, hm?

767
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,771
Don't play the fool, get off

768
01:29:56,501 --> 01:29:59,072
Get up you fatso, it will break

769
01:29:59,134 --> 01:30:01,239
This is for pregnant women
Go keep it inside

770
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:03,143
Go

771
01:30:04,334 --> 01:30:06,211
Sis, look it this

772
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:08,571
What is it tell me lkku

773
01:30:08,667 --> 01:30:09,543
Come here

774
01:30:09,634 --> 01:30:12,012
Aju'ka is here
Come quickly

775
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,180
This is for you

776
01:30:20,234 --> 01:30:23,215
Aju'kka brought it
for you to crap

777
01:30:27,134 --> 01:30:30,081
- I have to tell you something
- What is it?

778
01:30:30,167 --> 01:30:33,444
If you have to met Aju'kka
Don't you have to wear this now?

779
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,207
Ah yes!
Give it to me

780
01:30:35,267 --> 01:30:38,214
But ifl have to give it to you
Give me 360 rupees

781
01:30:38,267 --> 01:30:44,684
I want to buy a corset
Look at my stomach, so flabby

782
01:30:44,767 --> 01:30:46,144
What's all this Ikku?

783
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,770
Didn't you take Rs 200
from me yesterday?

784
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,310
- Give it to me
- I saw you with cash

785
01:30:50,367 --> 01:30:53,314
Don't play the fool
That money is for provisions

786
01:30:53,367 --> 01:30:56,766
Not my problem, I won't give this
Unless you give me money

787
01:30:56,767 --> 01:30:58,440
You won't eh?

788
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:03,338
- Give it here
- Let go

789
01:31:08,534 --> 01:31:11,014
Give it to me

790
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,409
You won't, eh?

791
01:31:15,501 --> 01:31:18,038
You will get it from me

792
01:31:20,067 --> 01:31:23,014
I won't give it

793
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:27,274
It will tear

794
01:32:06,367 --> 01:32:09,678
Sis is not pregnant
She was lying

795
01:32:09,734 --> 01:32:12,738
This is what it is
Cotton pregnancy

796
01:32:15,234 --> 01:32:17,544
Go take this and
crap in it yourself

797
01:32:25,634 --> 01:32:28,308
My Goddess of Kalliyangathu!

798
01:32:28,401 --> 01:32:35,717
Even I couldn't make out
this fraud pregnancy of this girl

799
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:42,410
You could have
at least told him the truth

800
01:32:42,467 --> 01:32:47,109
Do you know how much
he loved you and your fake baby?

801
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:51,673
He had set out to give
security to a husbandless girl

802
01:32:51,734 --> 01:32:53,975
Look at him
Such a pitiful sight

803
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:59,345
I've heard Kasargod was known
for fraud passport and VISA

804
01:32:59,434 --> 01:33:02,313
But this...is for the first time

805
01:33:02,367 --> 01:33:05,644
Just because our doctor
was partial to pregnant women

806
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:10,012
She just sailed through
her job here all these days

807
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:14,546
No woman would
have fooled him like this

808
01:33:17,567 --> 01:33:19,979
Why are you crying?

809
01:33:20,067 --> 01:33:23,981
I was on night duty
all these months because of her

810
01:33:27,067 --> 01:33:30,310
Why is he sitting as if
it was the end of the world?

811
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,313
He should be happy, isn't it?

812
01:33:33,367 --> 01:33:37,509
He lost what he could
have got for free

813
01:34:02,701 --> 01:34:04,738
Doctor please forgive me

814
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:11,007
When I came late for duty
the lie just slipped out in fear

815
01:34:11,234 --> 01:34:14,511
When everybody started
caring for my well being

816
01:34:14,567 --> 01:34:16,547
ljust played along

817
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:19,772
My brother and I
are alone in this world

818
01:34:20,001 --> 01:34:23,778
We had a house
Now it is the bank mortgaged

819
01:34:25,767 --> 01:34:28,976
We used to live
in our uncles house

820
01:34:29,034 --> 01:34:33,005
His son married and
with 3 kids harassed me

821
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,075
He wanted me

822
01:34:35,567 --> 01:34:40,744
We shifted to another house
He used to come there also, that rascal

823
01:34:41,667 --> 01:34:47,208
When we had no way out
Dr Adam told me of the vacancy here

824
01:34:47,334 --> 01:34:51,976
When I shifted here with lkku
I had only one ambition

825
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,273
To live a contented life

826
01:34:54,334 --> 01:34:58,373
And to retrieve my house
from the mortgage in the bank

827
01:35:00,434 --> 01:35:03,142
I did not want to cheat anyone

828
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,973
When you started
coming closer to me...

829
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:14,549
...l thought you'd go away
when you heard I was pregnant

830
01:35:24,034 --> 01:35:25,536
Tell me Susan

831
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:41,641
I could not sit there any longer

832
01:36:42,234 --> 01:36:46,410
I kept hearing
the continuous cry of a baby

833
01:36:47,667 --> 01:36:50,648
That's why I came here

834
01:36:52,767 --> 01:36:56,237
I'll pray as doctor
asked me to do

835
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:03,707
Don't cry, I'm sorry my child
I said that in a moment of stress

836
01:37:03,767 --> 01:37:04,768
I am sorry

837
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:11,072
I did not become pregnant by
my lack of morality like you said

838
01:37:13,134 --> 01:37:16,411
I can't say any more now

839
01:37:19,067 --> 01:37:24,983
Those who knew me
could have named anyone

840
01:37:25,134 --> 01:37:28,672
Any number of stories can be made

841
01:37:29,567 --> 01:37:35,415
But when you also said that
I could not bear it

842
01:37:36,567 --> 01:37:43,451
Mobile games and TV cartoons
were my efforts to forget many things

843
01:37:44,201 --> 01:37:51,278
But I never thought it would
land me in such a great sin

844
01:38:52,367 --> 01:38:55,246
I hope none of our
friends see us here

845
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:58,611
As soon as she delivers
let her go away as soon as possible

846
01:38:58,667 --> 01:39:00,408
She also wants only that

847
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:04,039
The apartment in Bangalore
will be soon be furnished and ready

848
01:39:05,334 --> 01:39:08,406
Oh you are standing here
They must be looking for you at the OP

849
01:39:08,467 --> 01:39:13,974
Look at him standing
Looks as if he was responsible for all this

850
01:39:16,634 --> 01:39:21,344
So looking at the belly you also
can predict who the father is rig ht?

851
01:39:21,401 --> 01:39:22,505
Sure I can

852
01:39:22,701 --> 01:39:23,736
Excuse me

853
01:39:24,634 --> 01:39:28,377
We are a bit late
We are Saira's parents

854
01:39:28,567 --> 01:39:31,480
Can Saira's mom
go in to see her?

855
01:40:08,767 --> 01:40:14,581
Doctor!
The bay is not moving

856
01:40:27,634 --> 01:40:30,171
The baby's position changed, that's all

857
01:40:39,467 --> 01:40:41,344
Don't touch me

858
01:40:42,668 --> 01:40:44,306
Saira...no

859
01:40:58,301 --> 01:41:00,645
Saira's mummy
wants to come in

860
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,475
No

861
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,012
She is insisting

862
01:41:06,401 --> 01:41:09,575
Ask the watchman
not to let her in

863

A sticky wetness on her fingers'

And smelled it in helplessness and fear'

935
01:49:13,167 --> 01:49:18,173
'Did she have the baby as revenge
and as a warning to her father?'

936
01:49:18,467 --> 01:49:24,315
