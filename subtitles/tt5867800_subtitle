Careful!

65
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,500
Your footsteps they flower

66
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,840
Your sight so blissful

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,210
Haven’t you an eye of blazing sun

You give me endless unexpected wishes

78
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,500
He's playing with the tape.

79
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,210
Don't bother your brother.

80
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,340
My unspoken wishes you fulfill

81
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,800
A good heart is fortune granted

82
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,670

Look at dad. Okay?

87
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,420

Aruvi

91
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,170
Stop smoking, it has a bad odor.

92
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,920
I won't smoke any more.

93
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,880
Careful.

94
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,420
Load it.

95
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,340
It's getting late

96
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,380
Shivadhanu, aren't you ready still?

97
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,000
Aruvi, you little brat, what are you doing?Are you coming with us or not?

98
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,590
In the city

99
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,050
there will be parks and beaches and everything there is.

100
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,090
Keep it there

101
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,800
Arrange it properly

102
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,630
I don't like it here

103
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,710
Call him.

104
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,460
Sir

105
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,130
They are calling you.

106
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,670
Aruvi's father?

107
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,800
Yes sir.

108
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,460
Where is your house?

109
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,960
At the housing board

110
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,960
We've been here for almost 15 years.

111
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,670
You saw the graceful dance of a peacock

112
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,710
That makes you want to say your love is here

113
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,800
You saw the graceful dance of a peacock

114
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:57,050

You saw the graceful dance of a peacock

116
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,500
That makes you want to say your love is here

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,090
I love you, Aruvi

118
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,750
I want to be with you forever

119
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,340
Dinesh, I don't like you at all

120
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,420
I'll tell my dad if you continue doing such things

121
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,500
Shabi, let's go

122
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:32,500
You saw the graceful dance of a peacock

123
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,300
Please erase my name, I won't talk!

124
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,170
Praveen!

125
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Shabi wait!

126
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340

Thanks!

128
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,800
Do you have an extra napkin?

129
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,550
Can't you get your own things?Get lost.

130
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,630
She's asking for a napkin to me

131
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,300
I yelled at her

132
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,210
He looks smart!

133
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,920
How did you bring it?

134
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,420
Buffalo! You haven't even studied

135
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,630
Make some tasty curry

136
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,920
Sister

137
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,840

It is my grandfather's.Real gun.

142
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,750
Some great Japanese General gifted this to him during World War II

143
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,630
Give me some

144
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,050

Get lost

146
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,670
Forget her, she's always playful!

147
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,460
This is how someone should ask me out

148
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,630
A plain card

149
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,210
And when I open it, just three words saying 'I love you, Aruvi'

150
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,170
The feeling when you read those words...

151
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,000
That is love

152
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,340
But why plain?

153
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,630
How could you describe love with words?

154
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Useless!

155
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,800
Don't worry you'll be alright.

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,880
Teacher said it was compulsory, pa

157
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,840
I asked you to get the money ready by Monday, didn't I?

158
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,710
Did you study?

159
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,500

160
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,300
Shabi, Mitochondria issuer two-mark question, what's the bet?

161

162
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,800
That's cheap, never mind.

163
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,170
Where is your home work notebook?

164
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,920

I don't know why, Ashok

170
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,000
I miss you a lot these days

171
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,880
I think I've fallen in love with you

172
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,210

Are you mad?

176
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,170
Don't you know that he's hitting on Divya?You're just nuts

177
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,250
Why would I propose if I had known?

178
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,670
Who is she to text my boyfriend?

179
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,500
How dare you?

180
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,880
Aruvi, let go.

181
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,380
Why did you drag me out Aruvi?

182
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,800
Truth or dare?

183
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,800
You know what?Hell with your games !

184
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,960

00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,880
Mom wouldn’t let me go

192
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,300
Get 300 bucks from mom,but return by 10 P.M, okay?

193
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,130
Thank you dad.

194
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,550
I started

195
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,800
I did!

196
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,670
Mojo is calling you, go.

197
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,300
Are you gonna puke?

198
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Are you going to?

199
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,920
Why did you switch your mobile off?

200
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,130
Sorry pa

201
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,340
Do you know how long we have been worried?

202
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,460
Hey! Aruvi, wait!

203
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Have you been drinking?

204
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,340
No, pa

205
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,550
Tell me the truth

206
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,880
Nobody drinks at your house?

207
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,210
- No way!- Why not?

208
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,380
My father hasn't even touched a cigarette till date for me

209
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,420
I wonder how you drink and make a mess

210
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Do you like that guy?

211
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:40,750
Maybe

212
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,130
No way, nothing before marriage

213
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,710
What if I get pregnant?That'll be end of it!

214
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,670
Really?

215
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Why are you laughing?

216
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,380
Later

217
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,000
Everything changed

218
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,880
What happened? Sweetheart..

219
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Tell me..

220
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,250
I don't know, dad

221
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,420
I brought you up so Welland this how you repay me?

222
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,920
Let go of me.

223
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,500
You still don't believe me?

224
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,840
You don't trust me right?

225
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,630
I want it too.

226
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,460
Happy birthday Aruvi

227
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,550
I'm coming.

228
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,460
What Karuna? Is it a gift?

229
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,840
What is it?

230
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,960
Did mom say something?

231
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,670
Don't believe anything mom says.

232
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,250
Why are you doing this to me?

233
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,170
- He's my brother!- Come here!

234
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,250
Send this wretch away somewhere, we don't need her.

235
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,630
Let's just think she eloped.

236
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,210
- Karuna didn't even wish me for my birthday.- Shut up

237
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,380
Is it that important?

238
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,250
Okay, it's not important.

239
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,210
Kill me then.

240
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,170
She's speaking ill about me to him

241
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,170
- I didn't say anything wrong.- I wasn't talking to you. - Aruvi!

242
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,380
Aruvi shut up.

243
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,420
Come here.

244
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,590
If you were innocent you would have committed suicide when I didn't trust you.

245
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,550
You wouldn't be fighting with us.

246
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,920
Look at you.

247
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,750
Isn't it obvious?

248
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,000
We can't tolerate this any more.

249
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,050
Get lost.

250
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,630
- Dad- Bye

251
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,920
- Aruvi- Bye

252
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,210
Bye

253
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,730
Come out

254
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,440
How long will you take?

255
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,810
What would the rest of us do?

256
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,270
Did you see a green coloured panty somewhere?

257
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,400
That's your bag right?Can I check?

258
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,810
You know Geetha?

259
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,900
Her green panty is missing it seems

260
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,440
She's been creating a huge ruckus

261
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,060
What can I do for her missing panty?

262
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
She brought the whole place down for that

263
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,020
She has been cursing the panty-thief

264
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,440
You should have heard what she said finally

265
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,190
She said 'I can't look up everyone’s skirt, please return it'

266
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,940
Emily is afraid of none I told her clearly

267
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,480
"Look Geetha, Emily minds her own underwear, and doesn't steal..

268
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,980
she isn't interested in others' panties"

269
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,150
Wasn't I right?

270
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,650
Where is Arulmani sir's office?

271
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,940
Women self help group (NGO)

272
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,310
They'll teach you tailoring in ten days,then you can do it yourself.

273
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,600
You'll be paid 3000 Rs per month

274
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,190
Make sure you don’t take unnecessary leaves.

275
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,940
Thanks sir.

276
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,400
[Yours truly](A famous TV Show)

277
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,190
Within a concrete jungle

278
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,310
The oven is on the road

279
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,150
Amidst the untidy crowd

280
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,980
Is the cheer of life

281
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,440
The cheer of life

282
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,850
The cheer of life

283
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,440
The heart has a thousand desires

284
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,480
Desires know no boundaries

285
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,270
In a world of money, life ceases to exist

286
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,230
Money is not the way to happiness

287
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,900
Lets travel to the place less traveled

288
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,770
Lets taste all that kindles our taste buds

289
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,310
If its a crime to live in a world of crimes

290
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,480
Take it hard on the one who blames!

291
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,350
The heart has a thousand desires

292
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,230
Desires know no boundaries

293
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,980
In a world of money, life ceases to exist

294
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,980
Money is not the way to happiness

295
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,150
These men!

296
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,400
They may even overlook  Aishwarya Rai (Actress)

297
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,060
but they never fail to ogle at a transgender.

298
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,150
Are we that beautiful?

299
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,480
8000 Rupees

300
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,980
Father had a heart attack

301
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,690
It'd be really helpful if you lend her1 Lakh Rupees for father's surgery

302
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,060
- Sit down.- I'll return it somehow.

303
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,100
Listen

304
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
Don't worry at all

305
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,940
There is a god above.

306
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,730
Isn't it?

307
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,810
I could only manage so much.

308
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,230
Would they allow me to visit dad?

309
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,190
What the hell?

310
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,310
You think you can join us by giving money?

311
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,770
I can take care of my dad.

312
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,230
Our relatives are coming.

313
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,650
You please leave this place without causing any trouble

314
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,310
Words of love are uttered not only by parents.

315
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,270
There is no god to rescue at times of distress

316
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:12,980
Oh fools who trust these useless gods

317
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,940
Worth earning for this tasty food Learn to travel around

318
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,650
If its a crime to live in a world of crimes

319
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,020
Take it hard on the one who blames!

320
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,560
Emily Run!

321
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,940
You know where all he pinched me ?

322
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,400
With wheels on our feet

323
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,060
Blindfolded with eyes wide open

324
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,560
Our loss of honour

325
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,690
We willfully forget our loss of honour

326
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,560
We forget willfully

327
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,940
We spin like a top

328
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,350
We run with a narrow vision

329
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,190
Have we explored the skies?

330
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,100
Have we scaled the depth of the hearts?

331
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,440
"The terrorist Aruvi who is under medical attention...

If you don't, we'll have to handle differently

I don't want to lay my hands on you

355
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,940

Are you feeling better?

360
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,270
There's slight pain in the arm due to the bullet wound.

361
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:34,310

That Uncle forcefully made me watch porn

375
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,730
What's with caste?

376
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,150
For having entered the classroom,they feed my kid faeces.

377
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,900
I am a prostitute! I accept it!

378
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,900
But I'm ready to take up a job if offered

379
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,940
That's truth, we don’t need her any more

380
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,350
I will even tolerate my husband’s demise, madam

381
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,060
But hundreds and hundreds of Indian fishermen die everyday

382
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,020
Does anyone have the guts to question it?

383
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,900
If our silver star’s movie isn't released...

384
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,770
Hard earned money, madam

385
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,020
2,45,000; I've lost everything now

386
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,560
Am I a machine to offer myself whenever he wants?

387
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,600
I'm Lord Veerabadra

388
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,770
I am the almighty

389
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,190
I want my husband and my love

390
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,560
We are the seeds that are looking for the roots of the problem

391
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,400
The stage that cures your pain Over here, in "Yours truly"

392
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,400
The government has made the whole society addicts

393
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,270
They've opened wine shops in every street instead of schools.

394
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,480
The youth are murdering their own mothers for refusing to give money to drink.

395
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,230
It is only a namesake General Hospital

396
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,480
Just because we refused to pay a bribe of 300, they let my kid die

397
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,900
But I cannot help falling in love

398
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,730
Why did you kidnap my daughter?

399
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,270
She came with me willingly

400
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,690
The media ripped the issue of the girl raped in Delhi

401
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,270
In the same country 2,20,000farmers commit suicide

402
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,400
Which media reports that?

403
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,900
She is a woman who ran away to marry a low caste

404
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,730
Why should I not kill her?

405
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,520
Every student graduates only with marks

406
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,190
Do they come out with alternate thinking?

407
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,310
Right in front of my eyes my 10 year old daughter

408
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,440
was taken away by 17 Sri Lankan army men

409
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,850
I could do nothing about it

410
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,230
I've lost everything for one morsel of rice in the refugee camp

411
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,310
Let us enquire and decide

412
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,560
Everything told here is the truth, and nothing but it

413
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,650
Is it okay?

414
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Or is it a little too much?

415
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
It is okay

416
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,520
Play the final one liner again

417
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,440
Let us enquire and decide

418
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,150
Everything told here is...

419
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,650
Okay.

420
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,850
Anyhow, show it to the director once.

421
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,100
Please come down. The tranny is creating a ruckus.

422
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,810
Tranny?

423
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,770
Something is really wrong.Please come.

424
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,520
There is lot of work.

425
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,230
Fine, I'll ask it to come here.You handle whatever it is.

426
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,190
Hey Subash!

427
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,730
Baasha!

428
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,150
The baby shower function set is confirmed.Make sure everything is ready.

429
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,150
Please, I want to meet the director.

430
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,440
Peter, Sir It came in without listening

431
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,520
- Get up!- Wait

432
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,400
- What is your name?- Emily

433
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,520
Your number?

434
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,940
Fine. We'll call you. You may leave now.

435
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,690
Who are you?

436
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,270
He is the Director's assistant.

437
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,810
Are you his mouthpiece?

438
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,100
Are you not the director?

439
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,270
I asked for the director and you have got him.

440
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,270
He will also be a director soon.

441
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,560
Look

442
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,770
If you have any problem, take a paper and write all your details

443
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,230
mention police cases if you have any filed and send it in post

444
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,730
Yeah, he'll read your post

445
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,520
and call you if your problem is interesting

446
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,230
Get up! You heard him.Leave now.

447
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,520
I didn't even hit you.Why are you crying?

448
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,940
You say you'll enquire and investigate

449
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,480
but you're not even listening to my problem

450
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,060
You're only keen on shooing me away

451
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,350
I won't leave without meeting the director, ask him to come

452
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,650
Look, first stop crying

453
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,350
The director isn't here

454
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Tell me your problem I'll do what I can

455
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,230
Three sex hungry men cheated and ran away.

456
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,230
Cheap buggers.

457
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,690
Okay, we have a shoot tomorrow.

458
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,980
I have your number

459
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,190
I'll call you when there's no shooting

460
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,400
When will you call?

461
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
I'll call you.

462
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,230
Leave!

463
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,980
Leave now. You heard him.

464
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,440
Get out soon

465
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,730
Off you go.

466
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,650
Bro!

467
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,690
How?

468
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,560
Three men? For a tranny?

469
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,810
Sorry madam, I was caught up with something

470
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,230
What have you done, Peter?

471
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,350
What happened?

472
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,020
I asked him to sew gems

473
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,980
I asked for yellow ones and he has sewn orange ones

474
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,190
Tell your director I that I can't wear it

475
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,270
Madam, I fixed it already Everything’s ready for tomorrow's shoot

476
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,440
Oh, we have shoot tomorrow?

477
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,650
Madam?(Shouting)

478
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,600
Sorry, madam

479
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,730
We have shoot at 8 AM tomorrow

480
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,230
I confirmed it with you

481
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Oh OK.

482
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,350
What matter for tomorrow's program

483
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,150
The other day we had a pregnant woman who was kicked by her husband in the stomach

484
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,810
- Hello- How are you?

485
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,190
Thanks for coming.

486
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,770
Come please

487
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,310
What in the stomach?

488
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,900
Kicked in the stomach, she cried because she had no baby shower function

489
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,020
We have planned to do that function for her in the set

490
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,770
See

491
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,400
Costume has to be good for that function

492
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,310
Inform your director that the blouse has to be perfect

493
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,980
Okay, bye.

494
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,980
Tell me, Amirthavalli

495
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,310
Oh my god !

496
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,150
Greetings! BED TIME QUERIES

497
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,230
Greetings.

498
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,480
Tell us your name and where you're calling from

499
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,690
It's been one and half months since my wife gave birth to our kid

500
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,270
And hence I'm confused about how to...?

501
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,270
What's your confusion?

502
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,100
You want to know when to start your next, is it not?

503
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Yes, Madam

504
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,440
Wait, the doctor will speak to you

505
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,230
Greetings!

506
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,650
Was it a normal delivery or a caesarean?

507
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,060
It was a caesarean, doctor

508
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,810
A minimum of two month's gap is advisable

509
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,190
It depends on your wife's health

510
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,980
You can begin again soon, thank you sir

511
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,940
Before speaking to this caller

512
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,650
we were speaking about increasing the power.

513
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,270
Before we continue, let's go for a break

514
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,150
Cut it!

515
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,440
Fool!Can't see it's online

516
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,600
And you walk in just like that!

517
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,400
Idiot!Move the fan a bit.

518
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,270
Go closer to her.

519
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,480
Sorry, sir We have a small problem

520
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,400
What?

521
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,060
We planned to go to shoot with that pregnant case

522
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,560
Yes, we did

523
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,850
Go forward

524
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,480
We planned to do the baby shower(exclusively for pregnant ladies)

525
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Yes, we did

526
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,980
The delivery happened

527
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
Delivery...

528
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,310
Delivery?

529
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,100
Tomorrow's the shoot and now you're telling me this

530
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,810
What can I do about it, Sir?

531
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,650
You're questioning me?

532
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,270
I don't care what you do

533
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,100
Day-after-tomorrow's telecast should go as planned

534
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,850
- Understood? - Yes.- Get out of my sight

535
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,270
Baby ready?

536
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,520
Smile!

537
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,310
All the bangles shops are closed.

538
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,230
What do we do? I've got 3 sets at home.Would that do?

539
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,900
Listen, that won't do. The baby shower set up is canceled. I'll keep you posted on what is required.

540
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,850
The shoot is canceled?

541
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,480
The shoot is not canceled. Only the baby shower is canceled.

542
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,600
- Now hang up. I'll update you.- Sorry bro.

543
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,520
Brother!

544
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,190
How did the transgender get three men?

545
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,900
I'll ram you into the ground Get lost

546
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,690
Why are you angry?Is the shoot cancel?

547
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,480
Please go, I don't want to talk

548
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,230
Subash!

549
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,520
Check if it left

550
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,730
It left long ago

551
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,020
Catch her, I'm coming

552
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,600
- I'm not calling her back- Just do what I say

553
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Dear viewers, as prescribed by our doctor...

554
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,270

555
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,650
everything will function properly.Isn't it Doctor?

556
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,520
Yes indeed. Do not forget to add a little too much of the special ingredient.

557
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,150
Correct Doctor.

558
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,770
What is it?

559
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,690
A poor transgender

560
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,520
Three men ruin her life

561
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,190
She is now stranded on the streets

562
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,480
There will not be any telecast problems

563
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,940
We can proceed with the shoot.

564
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,650
Fine.

565
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,770
It's interesting.

566
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:38,480
A man transformed to a woman, ruined by three men.

567
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,810
Get ready with this story.

568
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,480
I told the director about your problem.

569
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,730
The director has agreed to shoot your story tomorrow.

570
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,810
Tell me, three men cheated you, then?

571
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,310
Not me, they tricked my friend Aruvi

572
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,270
- Old man, you got a light?- Here you go.

573
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,850
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

574
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,770
You never let me tell anything.You were keen on shooing me.

575
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,980
Sir thought it was me who was cheated

576
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,600
That was my doubt all along

577
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,060
How would three men do a transgender?

578
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,700
You guys can't even provide a lemon tea?To hell with the production team.

579
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,200
Good for nothing. And you claim to be a manager?

580
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,660
I feel like giving you a tight slap.Rascal!

581
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,410
What is it?

582
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,160
Sir...

583
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,790
Stop staring at my face!What is wrong with you?

584
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,790
Now tell me.

585
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,660
Sir, those 3 men who got cheated...

586
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,200
Err, I mean the 3 men didn’t cheat the transgender.

587
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,120
Actually the victim is a girl.

588
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,700
Don't you know the difference between a woman and a transgender?

589
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,200
How are you going to make movies?

590
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,200
Look at your face!

591
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,620
Are you kidding me with the telecast scheduled for day after tomorrow?

592
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,870
I don't care if it is a man or a woman Ora transgender. Get ready with a story.

593
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,000
Madam has been informed of shoot at tomorrow morning at 10.00am.

594
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,750
If there is no shoot when she comes...

595
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,410
Sir...

596
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,000
Nothing sir.

597
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,450
They don't let me eat peacefully.

598
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,620
Oh god! Madam is already scheduled for tomorrow 10 A.M. shoot .What am I gonna do?

599
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,370
Sir?

600
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,040
Send that girl to my room- OK sir

601
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,540
You may get in.

602
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,200
Come in.

603
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,120
Did you eat anything?

604
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,250
Do we have biriyani?

605
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,500
Get 1 chicken biriyani.

606
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,500
Sir...

607
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,000
What is it?

608
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,450
Two. There is one more person.

609
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,660
Make it 2 biriyanis.

610
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,330
Are you the victim whom the 3 men cheated?

611
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:29,450
This will be aired in the television and the whole world will watch it. I hope you don't have a problem with it.

612
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,830
"The 3 beasts who cheated an innocent & beautiful girl"

613
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,040
- How does that sound?- Super sir.

614
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,200
Get everything ready.

615
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,750
It's late and I have to get those three to come for the shoot

616
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,950
How did you guys come?

617
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,080
Please don't worry about it.It's fine.

618
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,910
If you want you can stay in the dub suite.

619
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,830
Tell me who those three people were,

620
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,040
what the problem is and other details.

621
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,500
OK Sir

622
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,580
You don't have to sir me.You can call me Peter.

623
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,250
Is it them?

624
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,950
Don't worry.

625
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,580
It's just an acceptance agreement to take part in the program. It's a simple formality.

626
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,410
OK Peter.

627
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,120
Hello, we're calling from the show "Yours Truly"

628
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,540
You have ruined the life of a girl. Why would you not turn up for the shoot?

629
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,290
Make sure your picture doesn’t appear on TV

630
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,540
It was your problem only when it was between yourselves

631
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,830
Now that she's here, it's our problem

632
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,540
I've been waiting for your call for a long time now

633
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,500
The call didn't get through

634
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,830
Will you be here tomorrow?

635
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,580
Are your daily chores more important that this?

636
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,750
That girl has lost life because of you...

637
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,330
Aruvi, that guy looks very smart, doesn't he?

638
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,330
Shut up

639
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,410
He looks good, I like it Is it wrong to say that?

640
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,450
What would you do if she goes to the police?

641
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,410
Sir, Please do come

642
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,370
What happened?

643
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,450
Two of them agreed. Only Dheekshidhar is refusing.

644
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,660
This is his wife's number.

645
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,410
Peter tell him we'll tell her and he knows what will follow.

646
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,870
Peter sir, please complete your meal first.

647
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,290
Stories are ready. I am planning to make my own short film and then go to next level.

648
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,620
There is this short film show that's...

649
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,120
Hold on for a minute.

650
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,120
Sorry...

651
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,040
I pressed the button by mistake.

652
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,330
I spoke to the Iyer. He agreed to come tomorrow. You may go to sleep.

653
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,120
Hey Subhash

654
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,410
Wake up.

655
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,000
Good morning.

656
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,580
Why are you late?Change of plans.

657
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,500
The baby shower is canceled. Now, its a story about an innocent girl who got cheated.

658
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,450
- Make 3 photocopies of the script.- Fine

659
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,950
Make it quick Baasha!

660
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,330
- Jayashree, status?- Is this position OK?

661
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,120
Yes, it's OK.

662
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,620
The TRP ratings would have come...

663
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,750
Take printouts of it and place it on my table.

664
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
Good morning sir.

665
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,080
- Has madam started?- She is on her way.

666
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,040
Ask that girl to come to my room

667
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,120
Madam, the director has reached.He is waiting.

668
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,120
Aruvi...

669
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,500
The director wants to meet you.

670
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,200
Yes?

671
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,080
Sit down.

672
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,040
Don't get nervous in the set

673
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,580
All those who cheated you will be here.

674
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,580
If any one of them talks ill of you, don't spare him

675
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,910
Ask him if he has taken women for granted.

676
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,370
Madam is like a goddess.She is so godly

677
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,000
When you talk to her if you feel like crying, don’t hesitate.

678
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You want to cry on her shoulders?

679
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,040
On her feet?

680
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,950
Do whatever you feel like

681
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,660
Prostrate at my feet.

682
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,000
Go ahead. I say it for a reason.

683
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,080
Greetings madam.

684
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,500
Good morning madam.

685
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:24,870
- Paapathi!- Madam?

686
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,750

Madam, Script.

- What did I say last night, Peter?- What happened?

690
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,700
How I can wear it if it's so loose?

691
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,500
You want me to keep adjusting it during the shot?

692
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,950
I'll inform them. Give me a minute.

693
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:39,410
Go!

694
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,250
Why did she suddenly open it up?

695
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,620
I should have studied engineering as my dad advised.

696
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,660
Get the costume ready

697
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,160
There's some problem with the costume, she'll be here.

698
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,620
How long does she want?

699
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,500
Looks like you have trimmed down sir.

700
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,500

Someone is whispering sir.

714
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,870

I must not find you inside the sets.Get lost.

717
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,750
Switch off all your mobile phones.

718

Saahithya Wet grinder presents 'Yours Truly'

724
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:50,830
Co-sponsored by Malavika Mobiles,exciting offers that blow you away.

725
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,160
Dear Viewers,

726
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,830
We don't know what kind of a society we are living in.

727
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,250
In this 21st century,

728
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,790
Women have achieved in all aspects

729
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:05,330
Man and woman are equal. We believe that there is no more patriarchy.

730
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:09,700
But in today's program, you will see the height of male chauvinism.

731
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,540
Today, in our program, we have an educated, beautiful and young girl.

732
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,160
She is now abandoned and homeless.

733
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:24,040
The tears of this girl makes all our hearts skip a beat!

734
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,910
We are the branches that seek the roots of the problems.

735
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,370

737
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:33,790
Cut

738
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,250

739
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,290

741
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:44,120

00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,950

743

Also, I have to change Srini into another school.

00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,080
No no no. I am going to put my kids only in Billabong.

752
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,160
OK see you soon. The shot is ready.

753
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:13,750
Bye.

754
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:14,410
Madam...

755
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,290
This is Aruvi.

756
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:20,330
Look here dear, you don't have to be nervous while taking to a famous artist like me.

757
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,450
Consider me as your own sister and share your problems. OK? Sit down.

758
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,500
Lip gloss.

759
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,950
Aruvi, Make yourself audible

760
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,700
Ready sir

761
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:30,410
Ready.

762
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,080
Peter, where are those 3 men?

763
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,120
They are ready. They are sitting inside.We can call them when required.

764
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:36,830
OK.

765
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,540
Ready. Silence

766
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:39,540
Ready madam

767
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,290
- Roll- Rolling sir.

768
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,290
Action.

769
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,410
Sir cut, cut.

770
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,830
- What's your name?- Aruvi.

771
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,910
Ready sir.

772
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,830
- Roll- Rolling sir.

773
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,450
Action.

774
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,410
Aruvi.

775
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,250
Beautiful name.

776
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:55,950
You look beautiful too.

777
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,200
When you sit on that sofa, you must speak only the truth..

778
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,000
You must not lie

779
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:02,000
So tell me.

780
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,660
Why are you here?

781
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,040
I had a small misunderstanding with my parents.

782
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,950
So I moved away and now I am staying with a friend.

783
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,500
Friend? Girl friend or boy friend?

784
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,410
A transgender madam.

785
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:14,750
Nothing wrong.

786
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,120
These days transgenders are treated badly in the society.

787
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,330
Madam, you are getting into unnecessary matters.

788
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,700
We'll talk about that some other time.

789
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,540
So tell me.

790
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,750
What happened?

791
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:29,540
3 men, madam. Initially they were good to me.

792
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,790
They cared for me knowing that I was away from my parents.

793
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,580
I never expected they would do this to me.

794
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,250
They made use of the situation, got closer and finally cheated me.

795
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,580
Who are those 3 men?

796
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,250
How do you know them?

797
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,830
One of them is my classmate’s father.

798
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,370
Then a healer who performs his Upanyasa healing in the temple.

799
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,200
Finally my boss, who gave me a job when I was struggling.

800
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,660
What are you saying?

801
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,120
I can't believe this.

802
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,080
Dear viewers...

803
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:02,790
Is it possible for a girl to lead an independent life away from her parents?

804
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,000
Looks like the society says 'NO'.

805
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,370
She is unable to fight back.

806
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:14,660
In the name of love and affection and disguised as a dad, brother and honest person they have cheated her.

807
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,950
The 3 men are here.

808
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,500
Let's analyze and investigate.

809
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,080
This is Saahithya Wet grinder presents 'Yours Truly'

810
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,160
Co-sponsored by Malavika Mobiles,exciting offers that blow you away.

811
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,870
We'll be back after a commercial break.

812
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,370
Cut.- OK madam

813
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,000
Where is Subash?

814
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,000
(Abuses)

815
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,040
Where did you go without offering tea here?

816
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,700
You told me not to be inside the sets.

817
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,660
Being logical is it? Go.Get us some tea.

818
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,500
Get ready with those three men.

819
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,580
Peter come let's explain madam what to be done.

820
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,580
Madam, here is the next part.

821
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,450
Madam, the three men will be seated.You have to fire them.

822
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,330
Ask if they take women for granted.

823
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:55,580
If we trigger their anger, we can then turn the tables on this girl.

824
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:00,330
Logically, if she has been with three men,then she definitely is not a holy virgin.

825
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,700
Fire her too. She will cry.She will blame men.

826
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,500
The 3 men will get aggravated.

827
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,500
One of them might even slap her.

828
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,660
Don't mind. Let the quarrel carry on.

829
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,910
We will step in if it goes out of control.

830
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:19,290
Till then, please fill up by pacifying them.

831
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,200
Try to get their emotions out.

832
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,160
Sir, please wrap it up and leave me by 3:30.

833
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,620
OK madam.

834
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:29,500
She charges 30,000 for the4 hours she spends here.

835
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:30,500
What is it ?

836
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,290
Sir. Coffee.

837
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:32,870
(Abuses) I asked for tea.

838
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,410
Don't forget. Please do not use the name of your political party.

839
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,950
Hey Peter !Get out of the frame

840
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,700
Action.

841
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:47,540
Saahitya wet grinder presents, 'Yours truly'

842
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,370
Greetings.

843
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,450
Tell us about yourself

844
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,120
Greetings madam.

845
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,120
My name is Arulmani

846
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,330
I am in the real estate business.

847
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,950
I am a secretary of the party VMK

848
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,540
I do a lot of social service with the intention of helping the needy.

849
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,790
Madam, enough of his stories

850
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:04,410
- So, you are into social service.- Yes madam

851
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,040
Having done such good things,how could you cheat a girl?

852
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,000
Aruvi and her transgender friend came to my office seeking help.

853
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,500
I enrolled them in the tailoring classes.

854
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,080
And paid them a salary of 3000.

855
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,950
She was regular for three months.

856
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,540
Suddenly one day, she said that her father was ill and wanted to do a by-pass surgery.

857
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,450
She wanted a Lakh for the operation.

858
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:29,160
I helped her. I have never seen her after that.

859
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:36,290
When a helpless girl asks money for her father’s treatment, you could've refused.

860
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,250
With what intentions did you help her?

861
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,620
I am not here to nod at whatever you say.

862
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:44,950
I have never asked about the money till date.

863
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,500
We know why you helped her and why you haven’t asked the money from her!

864
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,500
- What do you know? You call a man of good status and insult here.- Please keep quiet.

865
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,200
Dear Viewers, lets listen to the other two.

866
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:01,500
- Greetings.- Greetings. Sit down.

867
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:07,000
Tell us Swamiji. You look saintly.

868
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,160
(Chants a slogan)

869
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:17,370
I am one who sees happiness and sorrows alike.

870
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,290
I am a follower of Lord Balaji.

871
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,910
Venakatapuri Shri BhadriSheshadri Dheekshidhar

872
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,870
I do Upanyasams.

873
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,370
In our history, spirituality and medicine are intervened.

874
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:35,160
The Americans have learnt half of it and inventedreflexo therapy, touch therapy and many others.

875
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:39,410
All these methods use touch as a form to heal.

876
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,620
I do this part time using the traditional methods.

877
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,620
OK Swami.

878
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,950
What links do you have with Aruvi?

879
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,500
She was a peaceful girl.

880
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:52,660
Every Friday she would visit my temple and have the sweets offered.

881
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,750
She would listen to my preachings.

882
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:58,580
She was very pious. One day she was teary eyed.

883
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,370
I told her that all humans have stress.

884
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:08,000
The reason for stress is the imbalance in our chakras.

885
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,370
I told her that you might have some imbalance in the chakras or hormones.

886
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:15,410
I told her that she will be alright if she attends 10 sittings of my classes, free of cost.

887
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:16,540
She also attended.

888
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:20,450
She just attended 4 classes and finally she made me come here!

889
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,830
In the name of spirituality, is it not wrong to have an illicit relationship with a girl?

890
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:25,250
I never did anything wrong.

891
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:28,040
We do not have any illicit relationship.

892
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,870
I just applied my therapy.

893
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,250
What do you do in the name of therapy?

894
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,910
She accuses that you hypnotized her and raped her.

895
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:40,700
If the doctor stops using the knife for surgeries, can there be any cure?

896
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,660
By God's grace, I am doing whatever service I can for this mankind.

897
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,750
Doubting me is as good as doubting God himself.

898
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,830
You are very tactical. I will get back to you.

899
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,750
You look worried right from the beginning.

900
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,620
Tell us about yourself.

901
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,250
Please stop sobbing and tell us.

902
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,000
I am Joseph Mohandas...

903
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:10,450
I am an executive manager at a Ford showroom.

904
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,790
My wife died in an accident5 years after marriage.

905
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,500
I have a single daughter, Jessy.

906
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,200
Do you know Aruvi?

907
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,660
My daughter, Jessie has stopped talking to me.

908
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,000
Your sin is so grave that your daughter has stopped talking to you.

909
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,450
Do you know Aruvi?

910
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:32,540
She is my daughter Jessie’s classmate.

911
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,660
She was staying at my house saying that she had issues with her parents.

912
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,410
She is also like my daughter.

913
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,950
She is like your daughter. Not your daughter and so you misbehaved.

914
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,370
What kind of a person are you? Don’t you need to be moral at this age?

915
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:53,950
Circumstance...Situations... Drinks....

916
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,870
I am not able to hear clearly what he is saying.

917
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,580
Ask him to speak audibly

918
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:04,080
Is he telling a story here?He is already ashamed here..

919
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,500
You go ahead sir...

920
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,950
Look at the camera and tell...

921
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:09,660
Sorry sir! We'll go for one more.

922
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,540
We are running through,please go ahead.

923
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,700
Sir, one minute.

924
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,080
Papathi, glycerin.

925
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,540
- Sir, I'm ready.- Run through

926
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:24,700
- Rolling sir.- Action

927
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:28,540
Why are you crying like an infant?

928
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:32,450
You misbehave with a girl your daughter’s age. Are you human?

929
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,700
Do you realise the legal punishment for this?

930
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,500
Madam, lets go for a break.

931
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:47,700
Dear Viewers, I am unable to control my tears thinking of the girl's plight.

932
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,750
She has approached us for a solution.

933
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:57,410
This is 'Yours Truly' sponsored by Sahitya wet grinder

934

935
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,450
After this commercial break.

936
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,120
Cut it.

937
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,200
Super madam.

938
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,330
Pappathi

939
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:11,160
Jeyashree, Ask the girl to meet me- OK sir

940
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,870
I was thinking something..

941
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,910
Do you know Vijay Sethupathy (famous actor)?

942
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,410
He is a good friend of mine.

943
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,660
I'm planning to do a film with him.

944
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,410
Do you know the place Neelankarai?

945
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:29,330
That's where the Producer's office is.

946
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:34,950
There is a role of heroine's friend. I am looking for a face just like yours.

947
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:38,950
Are you free on Saturday?Give me your phone number.

948
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:45,450
- Tell me.- 7884542501

949
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,540
I'll call you in the weekend.Let's see how it works.

950
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,580
Centre the table Basha.

951
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,090
Others come out of the frame.

952
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,380
Ready.

953
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,800
Madam same mood.

954
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,130
Silence.

955
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,420
Roll

956
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,800
Roll.

957
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,630
(Abuses) Stop sleeping and start rolling now.

958
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,460
Roll.

959
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,750
Rolling sir.

960
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:23,130
Action.

961
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,300
Aruvi. I have spoken to all three of them.

962
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:30,880
They talk as though they haven’t done anything wrong.

963
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,300
What shall we do? Can we lodge a complaint with the police?

964
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,050
Let's not do anything madam.

965
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,420
Let them apologize for their mistake.

966
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,420
How dare you! Why should we apologize?

967
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,210
- Keep calm.- You threaten to jail us and she wants us to apologise.

968
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,380
Are you kidding with us?

969
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,250
I'm sorry Aruvi.

970
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,630
Having done all wrong and you apologize!

971
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,840
Does everything get over if they apologize?You have come here asking for justice.

972
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,880
7 crore people are watching.

973
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,920
Ask them whatever you want to ask.They are all yours.

974
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,710
I do not want to ask anything.I wish to say something.

975
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,710
Go ahead and tell whatever you want boldly.

976
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,460
I am suffering from AIDS.

977
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:21,460
These are the certificates stating that I am HIV positive and my medicines.

978
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,840
The receipts from where I took shelter and my skin patches.

979
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,750
I have been suffering for 2 years.

980
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,800
Since they have had sex with me,I doubt they also might be infected.

981
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,500
I have had immunity problems from my childhood.

982
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,500
Two years back I was admitted at a hospital for Malaria.

983
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,130
They diagnosed and found that I was HIV positive.

984
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,460
The nature of transmission was not known.

985
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:44,710
The counselor said that it might have been transferred accidentally.

986
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,710
People around me thought that I got infected due to sex.

987
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,960
My parents and my brother only know about this.

988
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,300
They also did not trust me.

989
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,250
There were lot of problems happening with my body.

990
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,420
I couldn't attend college properly.

991
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,630
My family thought that I was a disgrace.

992
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,420
I was asked to leave the house.

993
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,880
I stayed at Jessie's house.

994
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,090
I couldn't stay there also.

995
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,630
I then stayed at an NGO camp.

996
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,710
That's where I meant Emily.She was also HIV positive.

997
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:26,840
Please ask them to get diagnosed soon.The sooner the better.

998
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,880
Sir. Its rolling. Please call out for a cut.

999
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,210
Cut it.

1000
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,750
15 mins break

1001
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:02,670
Why do you ask me to do as how with AIDS patients?

1002
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,960
What if she had touched me?

1003
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,710
It is not contagious by touch.Don't worry madam. Please.

1004
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,130
Peter

1005
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:12,050
Why did you bring her for the shoot without a case study?

1006
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:14,050
She told me everything, but this!

1007
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:14,670
Shut up. Damn it.

1008
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:15,840
I would've become the fourth guy!

1009
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,630
Madam. Thanks for supporting transgenders.

1010
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:23,800
- Get lost. Look at your face.- Your face is worse than mine!

1011
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,670
Sir, the episode is going good. TRP is off the charts. Let's continue.

1012
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:47,420
We have invited doctors to our sets to diagnose these three men for HIV.

1013
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:52,670
They will conduct the tests. Lets wait for the results. Until then, a short commercial break.

1014
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:54,550
- Your name?- Aruvi

1015
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,130
- Age?- 24

1016
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,210
- Blood group?- B+

1017
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,210
Sign here, sir

1018
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,670
Sir, it's already 1. I have to leave by 3.

1019
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,750
Yes madam. Once the results are out,we'll question the girl's motive.

1020
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,420
We shall end the episode mentioning "to be continued...". You can have you lunch and leave.

1021
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,800
Sir, Please sit inside the room

1022
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,460
Sir...

1023
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,960
- Where is the doctor? Inside?- Yes he is waiting.

1024
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,920
- Why are they sitting here and weeping. Take them inside.- OK sir.

1025
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:28,050
Aruvi has been tested positive.Serious AIDS condition.

1026
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,750
All the others have been tested negative.

1027
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,630
How is it possible?

1028
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,380
Either of them could have been safe.

1029
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:37,750
Besides that, one needs body cuts.God is not that rude.

1030
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,750
See you sir!

1031
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,250
- Please inform all four of them.- Okay.

1032
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:45,000
My family watches all episodes everyday.Your program is awesome.

1033
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,210
Did you call me?

1034
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:52,750
The result says that the three men do not have AIDS.

1035
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,210
Don't giggle.

1036
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,250
We are not going to tell anyone about this result.

1037
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:01,710
Lets continue with the emotion and continue the episode for the next week.

1038
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:06,300
We will reveal the results in the next episode and end it on a happy note.

1039
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,210
Let's tell them the truth.They are all terrified.

1040
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,210
Shut up.

1041
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:12,460
Go now.

1042
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:17,500
Your Highness! Go tell madam that the shot is ready.

1043
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:18,090
OK sir

1044
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:23,500
Let's go for the take madam.

1045
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,340
Be furious on the girl.

1046
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,420
Ready.

1047
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,300
- No need of the jimmy head sir.- No need of the jimmy itself!

1048
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,750
- Roll.- Rolling sir.

1049
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,800
Action!

1050
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:37,710
Dear Viewers, There has been unexpected twists in today's episode.

1051
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:49,460
This girl has tried to infect these men with the most dreaded disease of AIDS through her relationship with them.

1052
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:53,710
The tests are being conducted and before we get the results...

1053
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:59,130
We have with us the three men and the cruel minded Aruvi.

1054
01:00:59,210 --> 01:00:59,840
Let us talk.

1055
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:02,380
Tell us.

1056
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,130
Welcome to the world of AIDS.All you three are going to die.

1057
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:06,880
Shut your mouth.

1058
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,420
Why did you do this?

1059
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:17,130
Like in the Hollywood films, some bombor virus must destroy all humans.

1060
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,300
What are you talking?Are you insane?

1061
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:23,750
Why do we have to live like this?

1062
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
I understand.

1063
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,960
Please take your hands off the mic, madam.

1064
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:27,920
Action

1065
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,960
I understand that you’re mentally disturbed.

1066
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,130
You can get cured at some psychiatric institute.

1067
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,460
Do they admit AIDS patients?

1068
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:42,130
You have put the life of three people at risk. Are you fooling around?

1069
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,920
You speak so casually.

1070
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:45,800
Sorry ma'am. Tell me.

1071
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,090
Speak calmly and I'll answer.

1072
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:49,300
Cut.

1073
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:50,250
Touch up.

1074
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,300
Please do not sob so loudly. It is picked up by the microphone.

1075
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,090
Tablet

1076
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,000
Tablet

1077
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:03,300
Don't piss her off by talking like this.

1078
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,000
I asked them to apologise

1079
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,380
But she is furious on me.

1080
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:09,960
I am calm and she is the one who is screaming.

1081
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,090
Am I screaming?

1082
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,340
She wants to bomb the place, and spread viruses!

1083
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,630
You bring some maniacs and take my life out.

1084
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:17,920
OK Madam. Cool

1085
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,630
Lets go for the take.

1086
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:20,800
- Roll.- Don't keep barking sir.

1087
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,500
Sir

1088
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,170
- What is your problem sir?- Test result?

1089
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,250
Please sit down. We'll let you know.

1090
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:28,630
Don't take our lives!

1091
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,170
- Sorry sir. A minute.- OK madam

1092
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,500
Roll

1093
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,460
Rolling sir.

1094
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:40,460
Madam, rolling.

1095
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,710
I know!

1096
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:47,670
Miss Aruvi. You have ruined the life of three men.

1097
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,750
Why have you spread AIDS to them?

1098
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,250
I didn't spread it to them.Two of them had raped me.

1099
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:56,880
They dug their own grave.What can I do for that?

1100
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,250
Why didn't you tell them that you have AIDS?

1101
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,300
I didn't feel like telling them.

1102
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:03,750
What an answer is this? Had you told them, they could've been saved.

1103
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:04,340
How?

1104
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,050
How is it? I'll kill you!

1105
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,840
You seem to be addressing her like a child.

1106
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,590
I am not. Am I not questioning her?

1107
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,340
You both please don’t fight unnecessarily.

1108
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,960
Ask them to apologise.

1109
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,590
You can answer the questions I pose.

1110
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,380
What sort of a girl are you?You are brute.

1111
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,800
Why do you ask them to apologize as though you are a holy virgin?

1112
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:29,000
Citing your dad's illness, you got laid for money, isn't it?

1113
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:29,630
Yes!

1114
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:30,550
So?

1115
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:32,500
I don't trust in the concept of being a holy virgin!

1116
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,800
What can a girl do if she is cornered?

1117
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:37,670
He touches his daughter’s friend when she is asleep

1118
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:40,340
He hypnotizes and uses the patients who trust him

1119
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,710
He touches the girl who asks for help.

1120
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,210
How do you expect them to be treated?

1121
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,960
Spit on them? Slipper them?Use pepper spray?

1122
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,670
But what’s the use? Will they spare me after that?

1123
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,920
Won't this politician finish me off?

1124
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,460
Would he have helped me with One Lakh,had I told him that I have AIDS?

1125
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,500
I did what I could.

1126
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,380
Do you understand?

1127
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:04,000
Instead of making these men apologize,you question a girl's chastity!

1128
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,420
What kind of a woman are you?

1129
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:06,840
I'll break your teeth!

1130
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,170
How dare you talk like this?

1131
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,800
If you die, should all the others also die?

1132
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,750
Do you know what is life?Do know the value of life?

1133
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,550
No!

1134
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,170
Madam, no problem. Let's go for a break.

1135
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,840
Madam, let's go for a break!

1136
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,380
Let's go for a break.

1137
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:25,130
Do you trust in God?

1138
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,050
No

1139
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,800
If you had trust in God, you would be scared to do something wrong.

1140
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,000
You would've realised the value of life.

1141
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:34,550
You don't have a family and so you are being like this.

1142
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:38,000
It is disgusting.

1143
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,840
Dear Viewers, I cannot even look at this girl.

1144
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,420
You might not trust in God or obey your parents.

1145
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,210
Isn't there a society?

1146
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,800
If you have to live in this society then you have to follow its rules.

1147
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,500
Only then you can live happily like everyone else.

1148
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:01,340
Don't you have any intentions of living happily in this society?

1149
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:05,420
I am asking you. Why are you being so staunch? Answer me.

1150
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,130
What is happiness in life?

1151
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,920
Are you all happy?

1152
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,300
Can you be happy if you live by the society?

1153
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,130
What has this society taught you?

1154
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,880
Don't lie, do no wrong

1155
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,630
Don't question others, trust in God

1156
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:27,380
Can we be happy by following all this?

1157
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:29,800
If we have to be happy in this society,

1158
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,420
It is not enough if we follow these rules alone.

1159
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,630
There is a much bigger responsibility.A family, two kids, a content family.

1160
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:36,800
A salaried job.

1161
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,000
Three meals a day

1162
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,880
Own house, a normal TV

1163
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,750
An LCD after that Oran LED after that

1164
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:44,590
Or a home theater after that

1165
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:47,300
A Car, a bigger car if we already have one..

1166
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,420
After that a luxury car

1167
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:51,670
Schooling for kids

1168
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:54,880
A private English medium school,definitely not government school

1169
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:56,800
DAV or Don Bosco, no

1170
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,130
Even you said, "I'll put my kids only in Billabong (An international School)"

1171
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:04,920
For a happy family, once in a week you must take them to the beach or restaurant or a shopping mall or a movie in a good theater.

1172
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:06,630
The ticket costs 120.

1173
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,420
All crap movies these days.

1174
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,920
A family spends Rs.1000 on a movie and there is nothing in that movie!

1175
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:17,130
But it is our fate to watch that movie.

1176
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,710
Apart from this, clothes and shoes whenever required.

1177
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,550
You can buy how much ever you want.We are bound to buy them.

1178
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:25,710
You don't have to think what you have to buy.

1179
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:31,500
Wherever you are, you are surrounded by TV, radio, newspaper, internet, mobile

1180
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:39,340
roads, surrounded by shops, advertisements with "exciting offers that blow your away!"

1181
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:41,750
All this is for money!

1182
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,710
The society says that I will respect you only if you are rich. Simple.

1183
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:49,250
Work wherever you want, snatch from anyone’s plate, flatter anyone, be a slave...

1184
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,750
.. be corrupt..

1185
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,170
..kill or coerce or rape any one...

1186
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,840
..fool as many people as you wish...

1187
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,090
..run a multi crore scam..

1188
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:00,960
no one will penalize you..

1189
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:03,090
Because, there is only one rule in this society..

1190
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:07,340
The society will respect you only if you make money.

1191
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:07,880
Simple!

1192
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,300
If you don't own a house, you have problems with your wife.

1193
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:14,550
Your relatives won't respect you.Nor will your parents and siblings.

1194
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:17,380
You will not get a groomer bride for your child.

1195
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:19,960
Where will I earn? For whom should I earn?

1196
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:24,670
18 sets of clothes, an own house, a 4lakh worth car, a crap movie for Rs.120...

1197
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:26,710
...these are not my wants.Whose needs are these?

1198
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,460
It is for some rich bosses in the world and his slave bosses that govern us.

1199
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:35,130
For all the rich pigs to prosper, they need a big market and India is that market.

1200
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:39,500
We have no choice but to buy their products with so many ads around.

1201
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:43,420
We toil everyday and buy unnecessary stuffs

1202
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:47,750
We forget why we buy them for and we keep toiling.

1203
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,800
Only then will all the rich people be happy in this world.

1204
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,340
God has created us to keep them happy.

1205
01:07:53,590 --> 01:08:00,130
To die fulfilling the wants and needs of the societal standards makes a family.

1206
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:03,880
Only then the society will accept your family and you.

1207
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:08,960
If you accept all this only then you can be happy in this society.

1208
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:13,380
To live a life like this you all can die of AIDS.

1209
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,920
Dear Viewers, the topic is getting heated up here.

1210
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:24,340
You are watching 'Yours truly' sponsored by Saahitya Wet grinders,

1211
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,550
Run through

1212
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,550
Run through!

1213
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,210
Run through. Let's go ahead madam.

1214
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:32,960
Shut up. I am talking and you start to leave.

1215
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:36,380
I have answered your question.Ask them to apologize to me.

1216
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:38,210
Sir. Get this girl out of my sight.

1217
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:38,920
Peter

1218
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:39,630
Make her sit down.

1219
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:40,630
Please sit down.

1220
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:41,500
Madam sit down please.

1221
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,130
Why are you talking to me Peter?

1222
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,130
Follow that girl

1223
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,250
A camera on madam.

1224
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,840
They are moving away.

1225
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:48,710
Jayashree. Make her sit down.

1226
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:53,500
Hey! Get out now.

1227
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,000
Go for a close up.

1228
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,050
- Sir please stay sir.- I am leaving

1229
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,750
Sir. What is happening?

1230
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:05,710
Get out I say!

1231
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:08,670
Get out I say!

1232
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:09,630
Look here dear

1233
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:10,800
Daddy is here

1234
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,630
Aruvi darling

1235
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,380
What are you doing here dear?

1236
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,840
Its my grandpa's. Real gun

1237
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,420
There is no place for such atrocities in this house.

1238
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:20,710
Aruvi is also like a daughter to me.

1239
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:22,000
Don't worry

1240
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:23,960
How is it? I'll kill you!

1241
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,380
I'll heal your stress

1242
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,210
There is no illicit relationship

1243
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,500
Someone like this

1244
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,550
Prostrate at my feet.

1245
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:34,590
Are you free this Saturday ?

1246
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,840
Share with me as you would share with your sister

1247
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,670
I have AIDS

1248
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,250
Why do you make me do shows with AIDS patients?

1249
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,500
Look at your face.

1250
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:43,090
Why do you bring such people and take my life out?

1251
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:49,250
Get out, I say!

1252
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:52,880
I am speaking here and you scream!

1253
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,300
How dare you disrespect me? How dare you scream? Scream now.

1254
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,750
I dare you to scream now.Ask them to apologise now.

1255
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,920
Yuck! I can't see a damn thing on the frame. Move aside all of you.

1256
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,210
What are you staring at ?

1257
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:08,420
Peter.. Move them aside from the camera.

1258
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:11,840
Idiots! Standing like an idol in front of the camera lens

1259
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,420
Useless fellows!

1260
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,250
Don't you all understand?

1261
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,050
Emily, bring Subash, driver and the security inside.

1262
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:39,840
Lock the door when you come.

1263
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,630
I want all your mobiles and ID cards here.

1264
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:53,550
Right now!

1265
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:55,000
Are you all dumb?

1266
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,880
Do you all want to get killed?

1267
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:05,550
Tie it

1268
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,510
Here, you have it.

1269
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,600
Subash. Just a moment.

1270
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,850
Hand it over to them.

1271
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,180
You three are HIV negative.

1272
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:56,100
The director and Peter hid this from you to make this episode interesting.

1273
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,600
You don't care about anyone’s life.

1274
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,260
All you care about is the episode.

1275
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:05,890
Why do you get grumpy?

1276
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:08,470
I know the difficulties of this disease

1277
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:11,600
An HIV positive person never intends to spread it

1278
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:19,350
For what you did to me, I wanted you all to apologize in front of everyone on this show.

1279
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,640
It got completely messed up.

1280
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:28,140
When my HIV condition was revealed,all of you saw me with disgust.

1281
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:30,680
That irritated me.

1282
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:34,600
AIDS is not a dreadful disease as you all think.

1283
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:40,430
It's a chronic disease like blood pressure, heart problem and diabetes

1284
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,720
This disease is a large business by itself.

1285
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:46,930
To keep a huge amount of cash flowing, it is not the disease that is to be killed, but the patient.

1286
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:49,140
Only then one can earn from it.

1287
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:51,890
I do not have any intentions of hurting or killing you.

1288
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,600
Your mobiles are here.

1289
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:55,350
You can take them and leave.

1290
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:02,890
You bloody wretch!

1291
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:03,760
Stop there.

1292
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:05,640
You think we are dumb?

1293
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,680
You come and say you have or don't have AIDS

1294
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,890
Some one here is dying from your gunshot.

1295
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:10,180
You walk away with a simple sorry (abuses)

1296
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:13,510
You are so timid and you threaten us with a gun?

1297
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:15,260
- Give it!- Let go of her!

1298
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,300
- Give it- Stop it you scoundrel !

1299
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:18,930
Why are you doing this?

1300
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,140
You loafing tranny!

1301
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,140
Take that!

1302
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,720
Who are you messing with?Die!

1303
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:35,260
Where do you think you are?Die!

1304
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,300
Shall I shoot?

1305
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,930
Do you want to die?

1306
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:06,680
Did I shoot him beholding a grudge?

1307
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:09,220
I said I was sorry.

1308
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:15,550
You thrashed Emily mercilessly.

1309
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,720
This won't work

1310
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,100
This won't work

1311
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,680
Get up

1312
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:33,100
Get up

1313
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,260
I could shoot you and leave

1314
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,010
I have no fear

1315
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:50,930
I don't have anything to lose.

1316
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:54,850
I don't care what you talk about.

1317
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,760
Make me cry

1318
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:58,010
or die.

1319
01:15:58,050 --> 01:15:59,300
Aruvi let's go.

1320
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:10,510
Ss..sorry..

1321
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:12,390
Say something.

1322
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:13,890
You heard Madam right?

1323
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:15,100
Say something

1324
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:17,390
Don't shoot

1325
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:22,850
You have 5 minutes.

1326
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,140
Make me cry, or die.

1327
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:28,220
(murmur) She said she'll let us go

1328
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,970
This grown up idiot pulled her again into this.

1329
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:31,390
Say something

1330
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:33,470
I can't think of anything, madam.

1331
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,800
I have a family.

1332
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,800
I'll try, please don't shoot

1333
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,140
I'll speak.

1334
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:48,260
Rajini gets kicked out of the house, in the movie "Muthu"...

1335
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,600
When I think of that scene...

1336
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:54,890
What's that noise?

1337
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,430
Please check what that noise was.

1338
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:04,680
Subhash? Security?

1339
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:05,720
Hello?

1340
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:06,850
Police Station?

1341
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,220
Sit down

1342
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,300
When you sit on that sofa, you must speak only the truth.

1343
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:23,010
You must not lie

1344
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:24,390
Okay?

1345
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:29,300
When did you last cry?

1346
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:36,220
About 2 months back

1347
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:39,010
Tell me why you cried.I'll spare you.

1348
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:47,510
One day

1349
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:48,180
One day

1350
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:50,140
My cousin Maari called...

1351
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,850
Don't cry while you speak

1352
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:55,680
Okay

1353
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,800
One day, my cousin Maari called

1354
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,760
from my home town and said

1355
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:10,390
The granny who sold Paniyaram (Indian delicacy) was in a serious health condition.

1356
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:12,260
The doctor said she’d die that night.

1357
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,800
He wanted me to meet her if I was going there.

1358
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,430
Who is that lady?

1359
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,760
In my home town she's someone who sells Paniyarams.

1360
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,100
I've known her since childhood

1361
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:22,510
Her name?

1362
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:26,430
We never asked her and she never told us

1363
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:28,850
Everyone knows her as the old lady selling Paniyaarams

1364
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,050
She has a pleasant smiling face.

1365
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:34,930
She had big eyes and she always keeps talking about something.

1366
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,180
When I was in elementary school

1367
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:42,050
I'd spend most of my time with her.

1368
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:45,050
Buying something and eat always.

1369
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:49,760
One old lady, fed the entire village.

1370
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:54,180
During the harvest season

1371
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:56,220
Kalathu dosa

1372
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:58,680
Kalathu dosa?

1373
01:18:58,970 --> 01:18:59,600
Kalathu dosa

1374
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,050
Two dosas with jaggery sandwiched between them.

1375
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:04,760
It's very tasty.

1376
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:07,390
I used to relish eating it

1377
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:12,600
She accepts our money without even counting it

1378
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,850
Okay, then what happened?

1379
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:19,220
That night I thought about it and slept

1380
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,260
Just as I feared

1381
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,010
Maari called me in the morning

1382
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,470
and told me that she passed away.

1383
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:28,720
He said we could complete the funeral rights if I came

1384
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:31,390
I went to the village

1385
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:33,100
We took care of the funeral expenses

1386
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:37,800
The funeral procession till the grave was a grand affair.

1387
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:40,970
Generally, in our caste

1388
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:42,470
We bury the dead

1389
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:44,850
But that day

1390
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:46,930
They were preparing to burn her

1391
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:50,010
I asked them why

1392
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:53,390
The kitchen flames have been her life all along

1393
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:58,470
So, the old lady wanted to be fed to the flames in the end.

1394
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:01,260
I felt very heavy upon hearing that.

1395
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:03,470
The entire village gathered

1396
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:07,260
We set up the pyre

1397
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:08,970
and burnt her.

1398
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:20,600
With wood above and below her...

1399
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:26,140
...the old lady was like the Jaggery of the Kalathu Dosa.

1400
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:31,720
The sight of it had me filled with tears.

1401
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:34,800
It burns

1402
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:37,470
That was when I cried last.

1403
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,390
Blazing fire

1404
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:49,010
Until ashes are what remain

1405
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:59,890
Oh Sinner, thy sins

1406
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:07,010
They emerge

1407
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:14,260
A tear drop amidst nowhere

1408
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:23,640
That changes

1409
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:31,600
My soul

1410
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:42,720
- That bar shop guy is inside?- Yes sir

1411
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,640
Leave now. Everyone!

1412
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,720
- What is the name of the office boy?- Subash

1413
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:48,850
This is Ravichandran

1414
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:51,430
Do we have signal? Can you hear me?

1415
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:54,550
Whom do you want?

1416
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:57,010
We are from the telecom department.We need to check the cable point.

1417
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:57,720
OK come

1418
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,430
- Who is it ?- Some cable problem nearby

1419
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:35,510
The curtain is open but nothing is visible.

1420
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:38,680
No one should know that the police are watching over them

1421
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,930
Okay sir

1422
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:46,140
Subhash, Bring that beer bottle

1423
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,220
Spin it

1424
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:07,550
Properly

1425
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:15,970
I cannot let you go that easily

1426
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:17,930
A game.

1427
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:20,720
You can leave from here only if you play well.

1428
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:23,300
When the bottle stops and points at you,

1429
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:25,010
you will do as I say.

1430
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:30,180
No matter how crazy it is, you will do as I say.

1431
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:33,100
For the first mistake, I'll shoot at the wall.

1432
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:36,180
For the second one,your head gets shot.

1433
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:39,430
Don't hide yourself behind the others.

1434
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:52,550
Come this way.

1435
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:00,180
The seventh tables,without any errors.

1436
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,470
If you make one mistake

1437
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:04,890
I'll shoot around you

1438
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:07,890
If you make a second mistake,I'll shoot you in the head

1439
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,100
The seventh tables?

1440
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:10,100
Yes

1441
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:11,390
The seventh tables

1442
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:13,180
You have 1 minute time.

1443
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,220
OK Madam.

1444
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,010
Seven 1s are 7

1445
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,470
Seven 2s are 14

1446
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,600
Seven 3s are 21

1447
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:24,970
Seven 4s are 28

1448
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:27,010
Seven 5s are 35

1449
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,640
Seven 6s are 42

1450
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,100
Seven 7s are 49

1451
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,600
Seven 8s are...

1452
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:32,890
8s are...

1453
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:34,010
Seven 8s are...

1454
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,800
Seven 8s are...

1455
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:36,930
Seven 8s are...

1456
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,140
Seven 6s are 42

1457
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:39,510
Seven 7s are 49

1458
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:42,180
Seven 8s are fif..

1459
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:47,800
fif...

1460
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,850
Fif...

1461
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:51,890
Fifty six..

1462
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:57,100
Seven 10s are 70.

1463
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:02,800
Stand back.

1464
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,100
Subhash spin it

1465
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,550
Don't know who is next

1466
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:16,390
If it is the security, he's dead

1467
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:18,850
Security

1468
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:23,220
Do you know the seventh tables?

1469
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,760
Come here

1470
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:33,430
The bottle you drank from has become your enemy

1471
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,760
I'll name a film

1472
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,180
You have a minute

1473
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:50,220
You will act out the film, understood?

1474
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:51,300
Come here

1475
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:53,430
"Nanban"

1476
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,300
Madam

1477
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:57,350
It's very tough

1478
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:59,100
How do I act this out?

1479
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:01,050
Give me some other movie

1480
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:06,600
"It's there but not there"

1481
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:08,970
Madam

1482
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:10,220
Don't bluff

1483
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:12,220
There is no such movie

1484
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,010
Sahasam

1485
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:22,140
What?

1486
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,800
The first one was better

1487
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:28,600
I'll enact that one

1488
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:31,640
Whom do I act to?

1489
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:39,550
Not the director please

1490
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:42,300
Even if he knows, he might not answer, just to get me killed.

1491
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:43,720
Go.

1492
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,720
Jayashree

1493
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:52,850
Come here

1494
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:57,850
Find out properly

1495
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:13,050
Your time starts now

1496
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,720
Is the movie new or old?

1497
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:17,680
How many words?

1498
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:18,720
Jigarthanda?

1499
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,970
Vadacurry? Jilla? Villa? Billa?Singham? Shivaji? Endhiran?

1500
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:25,350
Who is the hero?

1501
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:27,220
MGR?

1502
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,300
Turn this side and do it

1503
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,050
What? Do something.

1504
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:35,760
Car

1505
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:37,430
Car race

1506
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:40,800
- Accelerator wire in the mouth..?- Vijay (star)

1507
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:42,640
Thalaiva (movie) right?

1508
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:43,680
Hero "Vijay"

1509
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,640
One word

1510
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,470
Not thalaiva

1511
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:49,100
Pokkiri? Villu? Thirupachi?Thirumala?

1512
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,100
Gilli? Puli? Kaavalan? Kaththi?Kuruvi? Youth?

1513
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,470
I'll say something

1514
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,140
I've named most of his movies

1515
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:56,390
How is the movie?

1516
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:59,140
Vijay's movie and a good movie, how do I find out?

1517
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,180
Thuppakki (The Gun) (movie)

1518
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:03,180
Act properly

1519
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:04,550
What?

1520
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:06,800
Sex?

1521
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:08,890
Quick, time is running out.

1522
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:09,930
Fan?

1523
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:12,100
Wings, helicopter?

1524
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:17,390
Vijay, helicopter, saving people Are you sure it is a Vijay movie? Not Arjun or Vijaykanth?

1525
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,390
I don't know, sorry

1526
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,640
I'm not able to figure it out

1527
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:33,760
You said it isn't Thupakki (The Gun)

1528
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,640
Yuck ! What are you doing?

1529
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:51,220
Nanban (movie)?

1530
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:03,930
Madam, Can I use the wash room?

1531
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:11,610
Madam

1532
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:13,150
I have work

1533
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:15,110
I said I had to leave by 3

1534
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,450
Bring tea for everyone,you can leave

1535
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:19,110
Me?

1536
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:19,990
Yes

1537
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:35,610
I thought you'd die

1538
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:37,360
Alas! You escaped

1539
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,280
Madam, Shall I spin it?

1540
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:52,570
Peter

1541
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:55,450
You love me crazily

1542
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,320
Propose me.

1543
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:03,900
This is the flower

1544
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:09,820
Hi Aruvi

1545
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:11,900
I'm Peter

1546
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,200
I have to tell you something

1547
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,360
You're very beautiful

1548
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:19,070
Someone as beautiful as you

1549
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,320
No one could have seen

1550
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:25,320
The IG couldn't be reached.

1551
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,320
Peter is this how you propose?

1552
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:39,070
Do as I say

1553
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,150
Assume that I'm the producer

1554
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:43,400
You have 3 minutes

1555
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:45,570
Narrate a good emotional story

1556
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:46,860
Understood?

1557
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:48,860
Say it

1558
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:54,280
In a village, the village head is an old guy

1559
01:30:54,610 --> 01:30:55,610
Respected all over

1560
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,150
The whole town celebrates him

1561
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,030
There's a murder in that town

1562
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,110
- The people suspect him and he's heartbroken- He is dead for sure!

1563
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:07,650
If he goes home, everyone seems suspicious and despise him

1564
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,280
Like the movie Muthu he gives away his wealth

1565
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,150
He goes to the forest to live alone

1566
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:15,820
- Nonsense story- When he's old and waiting to die

1567
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:19,490
He thinks about how happy he was with his people

1568
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:21,110
and regrets dying alone

1569
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:25,240
He writes a letter to everyone pouring his heart out.

1570
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:26,780
He takes a photocopy and sends it.

1571
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:29,200
A nice guy in the town gets the letter

1572
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:31,070
Slowly

1573
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:32,320
The music gets loud

1574
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:35,530
He reads it

1575
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:36,780
He takes his bike

1576
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:37,820
Goes to a tea shop

1577
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:39,820
Gets a cigarette and smokes

1578
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,530
How happy the village head was

1579
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:43,110
What all he'd done for the village

1580
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:46,070
His good deeds seem to flash through his mind

1581
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,110
He stubs the cigarette

1582
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:49,740
He calls everyone

1583
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:54,030
He rents a bus, takes everyone and tells them where the village head lives

1584
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:57,450
The village head is happy to see them and sheds tears

1585
01:31:57,950 --> 01:32:02,030
Everyone makes him feel happy and he’s blown away by their love

1586
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:03,110
He's smiling

1587
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:04,700
The frame freezes

1588
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,950
And we inscribe, A FILM BY PETER.

1589
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:09,450
Peter, what kind of a story is this?

1590
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:12,360
You said you wanted a story for a good movie

1591
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,280
This story is bullshit!

1592
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:19,780
You narrate an old fashioned story now?With a village head and all

1593
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:21,650
It was my mistake to ask you for a story.

1594
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:24,200
Don't you write stories that are realistic?

1595
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:25,530
Why can't this happen?

1596
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:27,530
Please go back to your place.

1597
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:36,070
Thanks

1598
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:38,570
Give everyone

1599
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:41,150
Go give it

1600
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,200
How come she's serving tea?

1601
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,860
- Take it.- I don't want.

1602
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:09,740
Can I leave?

1603
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,240
Sit down.

1604
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:14,570
Sit down, you can leave.

1605
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:22,570
Sir

1606
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:24,240
Come here

1607
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,570
Come, sit down.

1608
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:28,070
Sit near madam.

1609
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:32,030
Hey security, Hit the girl with your stick

1610
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,610
- We all can escape- Shut up, We'll get caught

1611
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:36,900
Security

1612
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:38,780
Come here.

1613
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,860
Caught! Go.

1614
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:42,900
Go

1615
01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:44,780
Give me the stick Why do you need it

1616
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:45,570
Quick

1617
01:33:45,650 --> 01:33:47,950
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1618
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:50,150
Scared?

1619
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:53,280
Come.

1620
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,320
Madam, I'm 62 years old

1621
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:57,400
I can't even walk properly

1622
01:33:57,530 --> 01:34:00,320
- What harm would I be?- Sit down

1623
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:07,950
Madam is your wife. She has been in an illicit relationship with this man for the past 3 years.

01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:28,860
Tell me

1631
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:30,820
You're very beautiful

1632
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:32,700
You look smart

1633
01:34:32,990 --> 01:34:35,200
Your husband also looks smart

1634
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:37,360
What is your problem? Tell me.

1635
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:40,200
Are you kidding? I said I had to leave, why do you do this?

1636
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:45,280
Dumbo, she's asking you

1637
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,530
Open your mouth and speak. I'll tell you.

1638
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,610
She's Nagalakshmi

1639
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,740
I got fooled by her complexion.

1640
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:54,780
This is good for nothing.

1641
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,280
This was working at a photocopy shop

1642
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,650
That's where these dogs met

1643
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:03,030
3 months back I saw the texts in her mobile while giving it for service.

1644
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:05,400
Do you know what messages they’ve exchanged?

1645
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,450
What is this?

1646
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:10,820
- A good husband- No one has the rights to talk about me.

1647
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:11,820
Don't get angry

1648
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:14,650
Explain yourself when asked to

1649
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:15,700
Tell me

1650
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:19,650
What else? Get us a divorce

1651
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:22,610
She'll realize only when she begs on the streets.

1652
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:26,200
Why did you foil their marriage?

1653
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:30,950
We are colleagues and whenever crossed our limits.

1654
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,570
What do you mean by not crossing the limits?

1655
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:35,570
Keep calm. I'm asking you Nagalakshmi

1656
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:37,280
Did you not cross limits?

1657
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:38,320
Good Lord!

1658
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,030
I don't know anything

1659
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:41,030
Don't lie

1660
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,320
We know, you aborted the baby last month

1661
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,030
Abortion?

1662
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:46,570
I had no idea

1663
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:48,280
Open your mouth and tell her

1664
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:49,360
Don't hit her

1665
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,900
No matter what you can’t hit a woman

1666
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:53,650
Sir

1667
01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:55,610
Why are you blinking?

1668
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:56,990
I swear to God

1669
01:35:57,070 --> 01:35:59,820
I am in no way related to the abortion

1670
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,780
What is he saying?

1671
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:02,860
Is it not because of him?

1672
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:04,110
How many men are there?

1673
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,780
I mistook you to be homely.You seem to wander a lot!

1674
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:08,990
Stop it

1675
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:10,610
We guys are talking our lungs out

1676
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:12,740
she isn't even entering the fray.

1677
01:36:12,990 --> 01:36:14,900
Listen to me, divorce us

1678
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:16,240
We can't jump into decisions

1679
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,900
Nagalakshmi what are you willing to say, tell us

1680
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:21,110
- It is all my fault.- Touch up

1681
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:24,900
Pappathi

1682
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:27,320
- Madam- Give me the cloth.

1683
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:35,950
Ready, roll

1684
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:37,570
Rolling sir.

1685
01:36:40,150 --> 01:36:42,400
You have a good husband

1686
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:44,570
Accept your mistakes

1687
01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:46,240
and ask your husband for forgiveness.

1688
01:36:47,530 --> 01:36:48,360
Sir.

1689
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:51,360
Do you have a problem with her being with her husband?

1690
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:53,860
It is a little saddening.

1691
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:56,110
Let her do as she pleases

1692
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,240
7 crore people are watching

1693
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,240
He won't intrude in your life any more

1694
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:02,950
Today shall be a new beginning

1695
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,200
Apologize

1696
01:37:05,110 --> 01:37:07,200
You asked her to apologize

1697
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,240
She isn't listening

1698
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:11,650
I don't want this,he'll thrash me to death

1699
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:15,360
- Let me go with him- That's it, it's done

1700
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:17,200
Take her

1701
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,650
I've been noticing you keep hitting her

1702
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,860
Look how she aches for me

1703
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,200
When she has decided to come with me

1704
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,650
Hereafter we will stand for each other

1705
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,570
There's nothing for me without her

1706
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:32,320
Tell her to let go of everything and ask her to come with me

1707
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,110
Let her go for shoots or anything

1708
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:39,400
I'll take care of her food,juice and including touch up.

1709
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:43,150
Come Shoba come sit on this sofa

1710
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:57,280
Aruvi

1711
01:37:57,490 --> 01:37:58,740
Step out for a minute.

1712
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,070
Subash, Do you have the number of the bar guy?

1713
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:23,570
Hello

1714
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:24,570
I'm calling from studio

1715
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:25,320
Inspector.. Inspector..

1716
01:38:25,490 --> 01:38:27,280
A call from inside the building..

1717
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,650
Hello. Who is inside?

1718
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:32,360
Will you open the door or should I get the force to do it?

1719
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:34,320
There are 20 people held at gun point here.

1720
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:43,780
Like the cops from movies if you try to break in, your every step means a death.

1721
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,490
The IG is on the phone after meeting the CM

1722
01:38:46,490 --> 01:38:46,990
Sir?

1723
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:50,530
- Have you informed Chinnappan sir?- No sir.

1724
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:51,490
People have already gone to the spot

1725
01:38:51,490 --> 01:38:52,070
Tell me

1726
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:53,490
I asked you to inform the CM's PA.

1727
01:38:53,490 --> 01:38:55,360
The patrol has left. Go to the spot immediately

1728
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:17,400
How can you suddenly put barricades around?

1729
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:28,280
Greetings. What you’re watching is...

1730
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:30,320
Get down. What are you doing?

1731
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,740
Please take her away. No one should stand here.

1732
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:34,700
Please don't form any groups.

1733
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,200
- Don't allow the media past the barricade.- Okay.

1734
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,240
- I asked for the site map- I'll get it

1735
01:39:43,450 --> 01:39:45,110
Home Minister's PA

1736
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,150
I just spoke to the higher authorities

1737
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,820
The problem concerned with this issue is

1738
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:52,320
The Central Government is not willing to call for NSG (National Security Guard)

1739
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,400
They are suspecting20 people inside sir

1740
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,150
If we are unable to tackle and there is any casualty

1741
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,740
The problem would become bigger

1742
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:01,360
The minister has spoken to the commissioner Shakeel Wahaab I.P.S

1743
01:40:01,490 --> 01:40:03,280
He was serving in the NSG for 6 years

1744
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:04,820
In 1999

1745
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:07,950
In the BGT Campus, there was a terrorist hostage crisis.

1746
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:09,740
He was part of the core team

1747
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:11,700
- Sir, you put in a word- I'll take care of it

1748
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:13,860
This is Pradhusha live from Chennai for NDTV

1749
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:16,700
Sources say that a telephone call has been made by the terrorist

1750
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:22,280
Breaking news is pouring in

1751
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,990
In the studio at Mylapore,Velan Nagar 3rd street

1752
01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:26,740
A private TV channel show's

1753
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:28,280
20 or more participants

1754
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:30,490
are reported to be held hostage by terrorists.

1755
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:35,200
Anandaraj reports live from the site, let us talk to him

1756
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:36,570
Anandaraj?

1757
01:40:36,610 --> 01:40:38,200
How is the situation?

1758
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,950
The situation is quite happening

1759
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:43,450
People have started crowding the place,they are scared to hear news of terrorists

1760
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:44,950
- An important development.- Tell us

1761
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:48,780
A government vehicle with a higher authority is passing by.

1762
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:52,150
Let us see if we get any info about the hostages and the terrorists.

1763
01:40:52,150 --> 01:40:55,070
Stay tuned with me for further updates.

1764
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:02,820
- Sir, Pushpalatha.- Office in-charge? - Yes sir.

1765
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:05,860
Do you have any details about the hostages?

01:41:05,990 --> 01:41:08,150
We are collecting the details.The site map is available.

1767
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,700
We have full details of 8 hostages

1768
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:13,570
Director Balaji, artist Shoba Parthasarathy are amongst them.

1769
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:15,860
We are collecting details about the rest of the hostages.

1770
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:20,780
The show's host Shoba Parthasarathy is being held hostage. Family and friends of the hostages...

1771
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:22,740
My house is right behind the TV studio

1772
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:23,860
I heard a gunshot!

1773
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:25,650
I've spoken to Nirbhaya Menon(intelligence department) in Delhi

1774
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:27,450
I don't know which terrorist group she is in.

1775
01:41:27,450 --> 01:41:28,450
Not much information.

1776
01:41:28,490 --> 01:41:29,950
Just give me 5 more minutes.Hurry up, quick.

1777
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:31,740
Madam, Nirbhaya.

1778
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,360
As far as I know it can't be any terrorist organization

1779
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:37,950
It could be eastern groups(Maoists)

1780
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:41,650
Shakeel is there isn't it.I will speak to him Ma'am.

1781
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:45,650
Sir, DG NirbhayaMenon is on the line

1782
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:47,860
Yes mam.

01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,280
Call to that number.

Hello?

1788

I'm not asking who you are or which organization you belong to

1789
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:10,740
We need to know that the20 hostages are safe

Too many gunshots, we need to know how many are dead or alive

01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:33,780
- Why are those people standing out there?- Funeral sir.

1798
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:36,490
We are running out of time. We have to get in and get those idiots out.

1799
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:38,070
Clear this right now.

1800
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:40,110
What are you all doing?

1801
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:41,650
Didn't you all see how furious the commissioner was?

1802
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:42,740
Clear the funeral first.

1803
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:44,150
Why are the media here?

1804
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,400
Tell me, what is your say in this?

1805
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:50,570
We have sent a warning through the Center’s intelligence

1806
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:52,570
Tamil Nadu is under terrorist attacks

1807
01:42:52,650 --> 01:42:54,360
What he says surprises me

1808
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:56,900
The State Government is responsible

1809
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:57,900
Who do we blame?

1810
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:59,700
- Don't talk without understanding.- We blame you..

1811
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:04,990
If the hostages are safe(radio)

1812
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:07,950
You ask if Tamil cinema actors can go save them?

1813
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:11,950
Your plea has been heard, you will now hear DSP's music from Ajith's Veeram

1814
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:13,900
What kind of a society do we live in?

1815
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:16,950
Everything has resulted in terrorism..

1816
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:40,200
My name is Aruvi

1817
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:41,780
I don't belong to any group

1818
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:44,450
I don't have any motivation

1819
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:46,780
No hostages are harmed

1820
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:47,990
I have only one demand

1821
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,650
I'll tell you my demand in a while

1822
01:43:49,950 --> 01:43:50,820
Fulfill it

1823
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:52,650
I'll surrender in the next half an hour

1824
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:54,530
Can you hear me?

1825
01:43:54,610 --> 01:43:57,280
I've sent you her photo,find out who she is. Quick.

1826
01:43:58,610 --> 01:44:00,450
We don't know her demands

1827
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:03,530
Pass the information to the Defense Minister.

1828
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,490
How many times? You fool!

1829
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:08,490
Move, clear the place

1830
01:44:11,150 --> 01:44:12,740
I asked you to stay away.

1831
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,110
Sir, the photo..

1832
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:15,150
Post people out there.

1833
01:44:15,650 --> 01:44:16,450
Clear them out!

1834
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:19,740
I'm scared Aruvi

1835
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:20,860
Hey

1836
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,200
Hey

1837
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,150
Surrender yourself

1838
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,240
If the force gets in they’ll fire you.

1839
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,900
Call them again and tell them you’ll surrender

1840
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:28,740
What can the police do?

1841
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:30,200
They would probably imprison me

1842
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:32,530
I'm an AIDS patient,they can't do that

1843
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:34,990
I can only be kept under medical care

1844
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,200
Subhash

1845
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:38,780
Connect the TV

1846
01:44:42,570 --> 01:44:43,820
This woman is named Aruvi

1847
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:45,030
aged 24

1848
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:47,650
She has studied Psychology at MCC, Chennai.

1849
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:49,860
She lives away from her parents

1850
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:51,900
and there's news of her having AIDS.

1851
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:55,150
To know more about her our reporters are there collecting information.

1852
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,200
Complete details will be available in a while.

1853
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:03,820
Special Officer Shakeel Wahab has indulged in police brutality.

1854
01:45:03,990 --> 01:45:06,990
You are now viewing footage of the incident.

1855
01:45:07,070 --> 01:45:12,400
A heated argument is taking place between the media and the police on the spot.

1856
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:14,490
There's another caller on the line.

1857
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:16,070
Hello, who and where are you from?

1858
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:18,200
This is Sabapathi from Myladuthurai

1859
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:21,360
Tell us Sabapathi, what are your views on the incident?

1860
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:23,070
The laws and punishments should be severe

1861
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:25,200
Women like Aruvi don't deserve mercy.

1862
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:28,570
Like the Gulf countries, we should kill her by pelting stones

1863
01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:29,610
Thank you for sharing your views

1864
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:31,150
We have received an update.

1865
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:33,530
A CRPF vehicle is headed to the spot.

1866
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:35,700
You are watching the live feed.

1867
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,030
Sir

1868
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:46,150
Sir, I was trying to reach you

1869
01:45:46,610 --> 01:45:48,200
Just to know...

1870
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,360
Sir, I'll just call you back.

1871
01:45:57,300 --> 01:45:58,000
Sit down

1872
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:03,340
We have covered up the area

1873
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:04,380
Don't worry

1874
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:06,380
Tell me how many are there?

1875
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:07,960
Tell me

1876
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:09,090
My phone is on

1877
01:46:09,210 --> 01:46:10,210
I cannot speak

1878
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:16,920
Inside

1879
01:46:18,630 --> 01:46:19,630
Guns

1880
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:23,750
I was told to give this to you

1881
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,340
Do you know to read Tamil?

1882
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:31,880
Yes

1883
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:32,800
Read it.

1884
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:35,590
Mutton biryani

1885
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:37,920
It's a list of food items

1886
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:39,000
Read it.

1887
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:45,710
6 mutton biryanis, 3 chicken biryanis, 4 mutton chukkas,4 fish finger and 4 curd rice

1888
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:47,170
It's a long list

1889
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:51,710
She gave this?

1890
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:52,750
Yes sir

1891
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:55,590
And a chill beer

1892
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:56,630
One minute

1893
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:58,050
Madam

1894
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:03,050
I gave it to them and I ordered abeer, check if anyone needs other drinks.

1895
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:13,050
Subhash must be here in a while,everyone can eat and leave.

1896
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:14,420
We'll surrender.

1897
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:24,840
Everything is here

1898
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,550
Who asked for foreign brand

1899
01:47:29,170 --> 01:47:31,380
I could only get local brand, is that okay?

1900
01:47:32,590 --> 01:47:36,130
Oh flag of peace that touches the sky

1901
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:43,170
The high flying kite, is that of love

1902
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:50,300
With lamps in our hands

1903
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:53,250
We search for light

1904
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:57,170
In the horse ride called life

1905
01:47:57,170 --> 01:47:59,840
The horse loses it's way

1906
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:06,800
Who is that who predicts the future

1907
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:13,630
Come relish the beauty called life while death awaits you

1908
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:19,800
I'm 2 streets away from the scene

1909
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:23,840
The green building where the crow is, is where the terrorists are holding hostages

1910
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:28,750
We have information that Special Action Commandos from the CRPF are here

1911
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:34,670
It's been about 6 hours since the terrorist attack at the local TV station, we're 50 metres from the site.

1912
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:37,880
Nevertheless let us be alert

1913
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:41,420
We don't know how powerful they are or what their plan is.

1914
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:51,170
Tear drops in them flowery eyes

1915
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:56,090
Fuels the soul drenched in emotions

1916
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:59,800
The search never ends

1917
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:03,380
Nor the song

1918
01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:06,710
There are the colours of fun

1919
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:10,000
and then those of abyss

1920
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:13,380
Witness God through life

1921
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:17,000
For the clutches of death are inevitable

1922
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,710
We're nearing the target

1923
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,300
Fitting the door blaster sir

1924
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:29,420
Sir, waiting for your command

1925
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:34,590
Go.

1926
01:49:54,710 --> 01:49:56,590
Arrange the vehicle

1927
01:49:56,750 --> 01:50:00,170
Sir, moving in to rescue the hostages

1928
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:01,880
Don't! Stop it!

1929
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:05,840
The media is here, don't do anything.It will be a huge issue.

1930
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,800
Take her away.

1931
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:29,670
The crisis of many hours has been resolved

1932
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:32,590
The terrorist Aruvi has been arrested

1933
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,710
We don't know where she will be taken

1934
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:38,670
Our reporters are looking for information everywhere

1935
01:50:38,670 --> 01:50:41,250
For more info, stay tuned.

1936
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:48,550
According to the current update, the hostages have been freed from Aruvi's grasp

1937
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:51,050
- Your name?- Joseph Mohandas

1938
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:51,630
- Age?

1939
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:52,630
44 sir

1940
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:01,380
- It's Nambu, a Japanese pistol used during World War II.- Whose is it?

1941
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:02,710
Her grandpa's

1942
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:10,750
Media people please do not create any commotion

1943
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:14,050
The interrogation has not started,we are taking them to the hospital

1944
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:16,210
Both criminals are AIDS patients

1945
01:51:16,250 --> 01:51:19,550
One is in a serious condition and can be placed only under medical attention

1946
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:22,800
Only after we produce them in court we can say any further. Thank you.

1947
01:51:37,670 --> 01:51:40,000
T4 cells are dropping out drastically

1948
01:51:40,050 --> 01:51:42,050
There must be proper intake and care

1949
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:43,550
There's nothing in her system

1950
01:51:43,550 --> 01:51:46,630
Culminating condition, let's see

1951
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:47,630
Emily?

1952
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:49,630
She is stubborn and highly nutritious.

1953
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:51,210
She will live many years

1954
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,340
That wretch went somewhere

1955
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,550
and brought back the disease.

1956
01:51:59,590 --> 01:52:01,550
Aruvi is not guilty of anything.

1957
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:19,750
The twilight is all that remains

1958
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:27,210
But the heart longs for the sunrise

1959
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:34,130
Will the eye of dreams close without witnessing it

1960
01:52:34,130 --> 01:52:41,050
Or be gone, it's purpose unfulfilled

1961
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:44,710
As a loving heart embraces you

1962
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:47,670
the sorrow of your mind thaws in fear

1963
01:52:47,670 --> 01:52:49,920
How long do I have doctor?

1964
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:54,000
You're fine, don't worry about anything and be brave. Understood?

1965
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:55,710
Your name?

1966
01:52:57,130 --> 01:52:58,130
Aruvi

1967
01:52:58,670 --> 01:53:01,050
Since the offenders are AIDS patients

1968
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:07,050
the Court has ordered that they be under medical care.

1969
01:53:30,630 --> 01:53:31,630
Just give this to her

1970
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:35,710
And if she needs anything,don't hesitate to call me.

1971
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:36,590
Sure.

1972
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,840
unable to enjoy the chill breeze

1973
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:43,380
Do I look ugly?

1974
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:46,420
No, you look fabulous.What's with you?

1975
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:52,130
your breath is always aching and longing for something

1976
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:59,460
whatever relationship we had

1977
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:06,420
does it look shrouded by smog?

1978
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:10,460
This is life

1979
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:13,550
even pain is an experience

1980
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:17,420
if you ask for more

1981
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:20,380
you will even be blessed with boons

1982
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:24,420
the body that experiences love, lives longer

1983
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:43,300
It burns

1984
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:45,550
It's burning real bad

1985
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:57,300
Jessy right?

1986
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:58,380
Come

1987
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:07,840
Should I wake her up?

1988
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:11,670
Let her sleep.

1989
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:21,130
the body that experiences love, lives longer

1990
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:36,090
I don't like being here Emily

1991
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:40,960
I guess I'll end up dead here

1992
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:43,840
It stinks here

1993
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:46,380
Take me somewhere

1994
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:50,250
I'm afraid I'll die feeling trapped

1995
01:55:50,630 --> 01:55:53,300
Take me somewhere please

1996
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:55,500
Nothing will happen to you Aruvi

1997
01:55:55,670 --> 01:55:57,300
The doctors are here

1998
01:55:57,630 --> 01:55:59,340
Where do we go?

1999
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:00,800
I'm there for you.

2000
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:01,840
Nothing will happen.

2001
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:04,460
Stop worrying, close your eyes and rest.

2002
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:27,210
Appa

2003
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:30,750
I want to see my dad

2004
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:42,630
Aruvi

2005
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:45,250
Daddy is here

2006
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:47,960
I'll take you dear

2007
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:49,340
Daddy is always there for you

2008
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:55,630
I don't like it here

2009
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,460
Aruvi is missing

2010
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:39,840
There, that's the building.

2011
01:57:51,130 --> 01:57:52,920
Look at dad, okay?

2012
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:20,340
We've taken all the tests

2013
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:21,920
Aruvi is HIV positive

2014
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:39,880
Hey

2015
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:41,960
Always iPad, keep it in.

2016
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,250
- Shut up your highness- Don't talk to me like that

2017
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:48,880
-You know what guys? I won't go to that shoot any more.- Really?

2018
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:51,250
- Dad?- No mom, FB.

2019
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:53,380
A new video message received

2020
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:55,590
Someone A R U V I

2021
01:58:57,630 --> 01:58:58,630
Aruvi..

2022
01:59:00,630 --> 01:59:01,050
Mom

2023
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,630
Emily, come here for a minute.

2024
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,300
We're shooting a new scene

2025
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:12,090
We removed her because of complaints.

2026
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:14,880
Wait, I'll call you back.

2027
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:23,550
I wanted to talk, that's why

2028
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:29,460
I don't know if I'll be alive when you watch this

2029
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:34,380
I don't know what to say

2030
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:42,960
I was a brat as a kid

2031
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:46,300
I used to make my brother cry

2032
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:48,880
Hit him

2033
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:50,710
That

2034
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:53,920
The puppy I left in my home town

2035
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:59,460
Parameshwari who was crying with her stained wet skirt

2036
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:02,550
My school friends

2037
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:05,340
I don't know what they’re doing now

2038
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,210
I wanted to get married and have a kid

2039
02:00:12,210 --> 02:00:15,800
How I should bring my kid up

2040
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,300
I longed for it

2041
02:00:18,590 --> 02:00:21,880
That child's face

2042
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:29,590
I can't think of anything else

2043
02:00:30,130 --> 02:00:32,000
I'm scared

2044
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:37,710
I've been here so long

2045
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:41,500
that the thought of dying and leaving here

2046
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:45,630
I fear that I haven’t lived the right way

2047
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:49,250
It doesn't matter if there's pain

2048
02:00:49,250 --> 02:00:51,500
It doesn't matter if there’s suffering

2049
02:00:51,630 --> 02:00:54,460
It doesn't even matter if I can't swallow food

2050
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:59,000
I wish I could live a few more days

2051
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:01,630
Appa

2052
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:05,500
I miss you a lot

2053
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:09,550
My thoughts are filled with you

2054
02:01:10,380 --> 02:01:12,670
I didn't do anything wrong

2055
02:01:13,130 --> 02:01:15,960
How do you live without me?

2056
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:19,300
When you asked me to get out

2057
02:01:19,590 --> 02:01:21,800
I had no one but Emily

2058
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:24,880
She is never idle

2059
02:01:25,250 --> 02:01:26,920
She never listens either

2060
02:01:27,210 --> 02:01:28,380
I don't know why

2061
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,550
but she loves me a lot

2062
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:33,380
Always

2063
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:35,250
She asks me what I want

2064
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:37,170
If I want this or that

2065
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:39,800
She would insist that I ask

2066
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:48,170
But, I've never asked her what she wants

2067
02:02:01,630 --> 02:02:02,920
After my demise

2068
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:07,920
If any of you name your kids Aruvi I'd be happy

2069
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:09,670
That Aruvi

2070
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:12,920
Tell her not trust anyone or anything blindly

2071
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:15,340
Tell her to reason everything

2072
02:02:15,340 --> 02:02:20,170
And tell her to be kind to all, it would make me happy

2073
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:25,710
I don't know what to say

2074
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:31,250
I had a lot in my mind but I keep forgetting

2075
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:36,880
This morning I had really bad cough

2076
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:40,130
I was scared I'd die

2077
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:41,590
That's when

2078
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:45,170
Before I got into another coughing fit

2079
02:02:45,210 --> 02:02:47,500
I wanted to tell you all this.

2080
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:56,340
I wish I could see you all once more

2081
02:02:59,130 --> 02:03:00,960
That's all

2082
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:11,340
If I ever made a mistake

2083
02:03:11,380 --> 02:03:12,750
Forgive me

2084
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:16,750
Bye.

2085
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:29,590
One cigarette

2086
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:56,170
- Okay sir.- It's just Peter.

2087
02:03:57,420 --> 02:03:58,590
Okay Peter

2088
02:04:00,250 --> 02:04:03,380
Peter, you love me

2089
02:04:03,380 --> 02:04:04,420
Propose to me.

2090
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:09,380
Narrate a good emotional story

2091
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:13,340
He goes to a tea shop, lits a cigarette and smokes

2092
02:04:13,590 --> 02:04:15,250
How happy the village head was

2093
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:17,800
All his good deeds seemed to flash through his mind

2094
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:18,840
He stubs the cigarette.

2095
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:21,340
And the music gets louder.

2096
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,090
Is this Aruvi's dad?

2097
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Yes..

2098
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:33,170
Yea. I saw it.

2099
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:35,550
Yes, let's go.

2100
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:36,920
What time?

2101
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,090
I'll be there in the morning.

2102
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,130
- Where is Andalkudigal?- It's right up here.

2103
02:05:55,630 --> 02:05:57,250
Appa

2104
02:06:58,880 --> 02:06:59,920
Darling

2105
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:01,800
Darling!

2106
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,420
Subhash

2107
02:07:20,170 --> 02:07:22,300
Shall we spin the bottle?
