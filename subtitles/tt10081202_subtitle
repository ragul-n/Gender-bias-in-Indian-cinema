Visakhapatnam District

2
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,083
<i>We always talk about love.</i>

3
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:41,417
<i>That love is powerful and no problems</i>
<i>exist where there is love.</i>

4
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,167
<i>But love has a problem in our society.</i>

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,833
<i>We never talk about it.</i>

6
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:49,667
<i>So it has become an outdated habit.</i>

7
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:53,000
<i>Since we never talk about it,</i>
<i>let's do it now.</i>

8
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:56,000
<i>That problem is caste.</i>

9
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:58,208
<i>We call it caste.</i>

10
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:01,083
<i>I'm not sure how people</i>
<i>get habituated to it.</i>

11
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,667
<i>But this is how Durga Prasad</i>
<i>got used to it.</i>

12
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:06,083
<i>The kid here is Durga Prasad.</i>

13
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,625
I am looking into it, right?

14
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,667
These papers prepared by Bhupathi
are flawed.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,375
Get them surveyed again.

16
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:30,667
Sir, the survey will be done correctly
only in your presence.

17
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,292
Hmm. You go ahead. I will come.

18
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:34,667
Okay.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,417
-See you, sir.
-Hmm.

20
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,292
Dad.

21
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,792
I want to become like you
after growing up.

22
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,958
People should treat me
like they treat you.

23
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,917
Everyone should listen to me.

24
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,000
They are our people.

25
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,417
We need to have a good name among them.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,917
Only then they'll listen.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,083
By "our people" you mean...
the people of our caste, right?

28
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,167
-Chinni.
-Yes.

29
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,167
We have to be strong.

30
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,208
We should be strict in matters
about caste.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,375
Then, our people will respect us
and listen to us.

32
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:15,708
Hmm.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,375
<i>That's how he instilled casteism</i>
<i>into his son from childhood.</i>

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,125
I am going out.

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,125
I will send the car, go to the hospital.

36
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,542
Durga.

37
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,083
Come here.

38
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,542
Durga.

39
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,667
You should always be happy.

40
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,583
Only courage and good character
can keep someone happy.

41
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,708
Everyone should be happy with us.

42
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:54,625
We should try and do whatever
we can to achieve that.

43
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:59,792
But it is wrong even to think
that everyone should listen to us.

44
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,208
"Our caste, our people."

45
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:05,667
That feeling creates cowardice
in us without our knowledge.

46
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:12,000
It corrupts our character
and kills humanity.

47
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,292
It will leave us unhappy.

48
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,375
Okay, Mom.

49
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,958
Give me some money. I will have a soda.

50
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,833
<i>Durga Prasad grew up.</i>

51
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,083
<i>His caste feeling also spread</i>
<i>like a disease in him.</i>

52
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:36,250
<i>On top of that, his sister</i>
<i>eloped with a man from another caste.</i>

53
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,250
<i>It was a disgraceful situation.</i>

54
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:42,875
<i>That affected his father a lot.</i>

55
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,208
<i>He became really strict about caste</i>
<i>ever since that incident.</i>

56
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,083
<i>Caste became his first priority.</i>

57
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,417
<i>The people he meets</i>
<i>and the work he does...</i>

58
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:56,417
<i>Everyone including his office peon to</i>
<i>the paper boy, they belong to his caste.</i>

59
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,042
<i>Even the tea stall that he visits</i>
<i>belongs to the same caste.</i>

60
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:05,833
<i>Caste is the basis for everything</i>
<i>and any decision he takes.</i>

61
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:10,375
<i>He created an artificial world</i>
<i>and reputation around him.</i>

62
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,417
<i>He got married and had a daughter.</i>

63
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,792
<i>Harathi.</i>

64
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,542
She looks exactly like your sister.

65
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,292
<i>That struck fear into his heart.</i>

66
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:26,250
<i>What if Harathi falls in love</i>
<i>with a guy from a different caste?</i>

67
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,167
<i>Harathi enjoys her freedom.</i>

68
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,292
<i>She does mischievous things too.</i>

69
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,792
<i>Durga Prasad's fear grew</i>
<i>when Harathi started high school.</i>

70
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,833
<i>He immediately changed her school.</i>

71
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:33,167
<i>He brainwashed her</i>
<i>before sending to the new school.</i>

72
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:38,750
You should go around
only with our people from now on.

73
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:41,917
Make friends only with our people.

74
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:43,792
Got it?

75
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:45,708
Okay, Dad.

76
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:48,875
What?

77
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,292
<i>Why is Dad doing this?</i>

78
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,583
<i>I lost all my friends.</i>

79
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,167
<i>What if I can't find</i>
<i>such good friends again?</i>

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,375
<i>Dad isn't a good man.</i>

81
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,167
<i>Harathi lost her freedom</i>
<i>and happiness too.</i>

82
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,542
<i>Durga Prasad was a loving father.</i>

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,958
My dad looks after me very well.

84
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,708
He gives me a lot of gifts.

85
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:31,167
My dad is really great.
He's a very good man.

86
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,917
My dad is even better.

87
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,208
Stay away from others.

88
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,292
-Do not mingle with them or talk to them.
-That's not possible, Dad.

89
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,958
It is better to be careful now
instead of regretting it later.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,917
<i>What is wrong with me?</i>

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,792
<i>Why can't I question him</i>
<i>about making friends of my choice?</i>

92
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,042
<i>Dad is a nice person.</i>

93
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:10,125
<i>But he is very particular about caste.</i>

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,500
<i>So, I will not give him a chance</i>
<i>to complain in that matter.</i>

95
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,083
<i>I just wish for one thing.</i>

96
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:18,708
<i>Someone good should come into my life.</i>

97
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,208
-Dad.
-Hmm.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,958
Because this is important to you,
I promise you...

99
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,833
I will do as you wish.

100
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,792
Every decision of my life is yours.

101
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,000
You won't face any problems because of me.

102
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,625
<i>Durga Prasad was relieved</i>
<i>after hearing this.</i>

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,875
<i>Harathi was happy</i>
<i>minding her own business.</i>

104
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,542
<i>This is Harathi's aunt, Sita.</i>

105
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,250
<i>And her husband, Srinu.</i>

106
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,958
<i>They are more involved in Harathi's life</i>
<i>than her own parents.</i>

107
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,542
<i>They spend more time here</i>
<i>than at their own house.</i>

108
00:08:00,917 --> 00:08:04,083
Sister! Harathi has a flaw in her stars
concerning her marriage.

109
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,167
It will be an arranged marriage,
but there is a problem.

110
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,375
I got her horoscope checked
when she was a kid.

111
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,500
She still has that flaw in her stars.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,083
<i>That's right. You are that flaw.</i>

113
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:21,542
<i>Hari. He likes his life</i>
<i>to be thrilling and interesting.</i>

114
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,000
<i>He always likes to do new things.</i>
<i>And he is mischievous.</i>

115
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,000
<i>His mother has a weakness for</i>
<i>offering prayers for everything.</i>

116
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,000
<i>Hari finds it boring and annoying.</i>

117
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:52,625
<i>Hari was obsessed about kissing,</i>
<i>even when he was a kid.</i>

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,292
I can't remember Newton's third law.

119
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:58,500
-I will help you, no problem.
-Okay.

120
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,250
Sneha, shall we kiss?

121
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,625
<i>I will get back to you.</i>

122
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,333
Math teacher is asking for you.

123
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,500
You too.

124
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:23,042
<i>The girl hit me</i>
<i>When I asked for a kiss</i>

125
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,458
Newton's third law, right?

126
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,208
I love Hari. From Priya.

127
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,250
With Smile.

128
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:00,083
Priya!

129
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,083
What is this?

130
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,958
<i>This is Newton's third law.</i>

131
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,792
<i>Since his father worked</i>
<i>for the central government,</i>

132
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,708
<i>they moved to many places</i>
<i>and finally settled in Srikalahasti.</i>

133
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,875
Why don't you study instead of
working on useless things?

134
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,542
<i>Cheers to the song of our eyes</i>
<i>Cheers to the melody of our hearts</i>

135
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,750
<i>His obsession with kissing grew.</i>

136
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,708
<i>Hari also grew up.</i>

137
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,958
<i>He works as a sales manager</i>
<i>in a car showroom.</i>

138
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,833
<i>But he goes to office occasionally,</i>
<i>like a guest.</i>

139
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,375
<i>He has some friends.</i>
<i>This is Babji.</i>

140
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,833
<i>This is Anil.</i>

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,375
You are not coming
to the showroom even today?

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,875
It's Friday.
I said we'd go to the movies.

143
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,333
Yesterday was Thursday, and you wanted
to go to the temple to watch girls.

144
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:05,542
That was for you.

145
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,167
What about Wednesday, Tuesday and Monday?

146
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,500
I wasn't in a good mood on Monday.

147
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,792
So we went for a long drive on Tuesday,
and I got sick on Wednesday.

148
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go to the movies first.

149
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,625
Then we'll go to the showroom
if we have any time left.

150
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,208
You can go to the movies.
I have two insurance files pending.

151
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,458
You are sincere and we are not?

152
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,792
If we are bad, you should be bad.

153
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,417
Bring those keys, clean them
and give it to me.

154
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,042
Will you come to the movies if I do it?

155
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:42,333
Why did you take this job
if you do not like it?

156
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:45,750
The job is good,
but the customers irritate me.

157
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:51,917
But we still have to smile at them
and act obediently to make a sale.

158
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,625
That's what the job is about, dude.

159
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,542
Hey! People are fools.

160
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,958
We should treat them like fools.

161
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,333
One shouldn't be nice as you.

162
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,750
But I miss them sometimes.

163
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,875
That's when I go to the showroom.

164
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,583
Let's take the car
to my parents' house first.

165
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,250
What are the features
of this low-end model?

166
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,208
The overall performance is good.

167
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:30,875
But low-end cars are for those
with a middle-class mindset.

168
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:33,750
Sir, tell me one thing.

169
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,625
Was yours love marriage or arranged?

170
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,292
The drive with your dream girl
should be like

171
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,833
the future you planned for her
before proposing to her.

172
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,625
You shouldn't take that drive in this car.

173
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,917
Then?

174
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,458
Super pick-up.

175
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,750
Was yours love marriage or arranged?

176
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,208
You must've been thrilled
about your arranged marriage.

177
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:22,083
You should feel the same thrill
when you buy your first car.

178
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,875
Try to think like an adventurer.

179
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,250
Super pick-up.

180
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,333
This is the only car for your wife.

181
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,875
Hey! What will you tell a person
who loves one girl and marries another?

182
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,625
I'll ask him to pay for this car
and take that car.

183
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:04,250
Sita discussed Harathi's horoscopic flaw
with a priest.

184
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,458
Let's send her to Neelima's house
in Kalahasti to attend a ritual.

185
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:09,917
She won't listen to me.

186
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,958
You should talk to her.

187
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,583
Rituals can't help her
if her parenting is bad.

188
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,500
I trust my parenting.

189
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,208
There's nothing wrong
in performing a ritual.

190
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,792
Okay, I will tell her.

191
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,167
Look. This is Vandana's picture.

192
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,250
Think about it and let me know.

193
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,792
How many times should I tell you?
I don't like any of them.

194
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,083
Don't irritate me with proposals
from your relatives.

195
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:42,417
She doesn't look like a girl.
She looks like a decorated idol.

196
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,083
How can I marry her?

197
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,458
You don't like girls
outside our relatives.

198
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:47,750
You don't like our relatives.

199
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,917
You didn't want to go
to a marriage bureau too.

200
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:51,292
What should we do?

201
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,333
Did I ask you to find girls for me?

202
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,875
We should find a girl for you
to get married, shouldn't we?

203
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,125
I will not get married.

204
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,083
Look. I have some goals.

205
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,250
Moreover, a girl should be interesting

206
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,625
and challenging.

207
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:05,542
It's hard to find such girls.

208
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,250
So it is hard for me to get married.

209
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,750
What do you mean by interesting?

210
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,375
Should girls crack jokes
or do gymnastics?

211
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,875
Hey! Won't you really marry?

212
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,333
Hmm.

213
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,083
-Chanti!
-Sister!

214
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,625
He doesn't want to get married.

215
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,583
Serve it.

216
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:38,208
Is it?

217
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,000
Hey, Nani.

218
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,125
-Nani...
-Mom!

219
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,292
It seems you have a curse!

220
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,125
That's why you are not getting married.

221
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,792
That's not what it is, Mom!

222
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,500
I chose not to get married.

223
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,875
That's the curse.

224
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,875
It is controlling your mind.

225
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,625
You should perform a ritual in the temple
to break that curse.

226
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,667
You are cursed, not me.

227
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:05,792
Yes! My life is a curse.

228
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,958
I am living an unhappy life!

229
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,083
Mom!

230
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:13,167
Don't you want me to live in peace?

231
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,000
Will you come to the temple
to break the curse?

232
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,750
I won't come.

233
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,042
Okay, I'll come, but don't ever
force me to get married.

234
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,750
-Tell this to Dad too.
-Hmm.

235
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,667
Dad. Here's your tea.

236
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:43,917
Harathi.

237
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:46,917
You will have to attend your friend
Soumya's wedding alone.

238
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,833
Suresh's son is getting married
the same day.

239
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,125
Mom and I are going there.

240
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,000
So tomorrow you go to Aunt Neelima's house
in Srikalahasti.

241
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,625
They are performing a special ritual
on 27th to break your curse.

242
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,375
You have to attend it.

243
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:01,042
Then go to Soumya's wedding from there.

244
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,208
Okay, Dad.

245
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,542
Here.

246
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,042
Keep it with you.

247
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:08,375
Don't hesitate to use it.

248
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,333
-Mom! Let go.
-Shut up and come.

249
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,333
These rituals are performed
only for money.

250
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,583
They say 100 things to make 100 rupees.

251
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:22,125
Come on! I will get bored in there, Mom.
Please.

252
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,917
They will do it without me
if you pay an extra 100 rupees.

253
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,208
-We'll ask for a discount.
-Let go of me.

254
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,917
You're here?

255
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,792
Take him instead of me.

256
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,583
-Come.
-I will never pray to God.

257
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,042
Why should we perform the ritual
on an empty stomach?

258
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,625
Leave it.

259
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:50,833
It's useless.

260
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:52,833
There is nothing to eat.

261
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,292
Let's check if there is something
for the eyes at least.

262
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,250
Oh, no!

263
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,458
Whoa!

264
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,958
My God!

265
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,958
What the hell, man!

266
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,292
I guess we can't expect more.

267
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:18,000
Why would beautiful girls
have any defects?

268
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,292
And why would they come here?

269
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,458
Because of the evil eyes of men like us.

270
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,792
She looks good,
but is too devotional.

271
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,833
Not my type.

272
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:50,208
My God!

273
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,708
I think she is a lady constable.

274
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,667
What are you talking about?
Just do it.

275
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,958
-I have a headache, and I'm hungry.
-Shut up.

276
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:01,167
-Hush! Shut up.
-I am dying...

277
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,708
<i>Wow!</i>

278
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,708
<i>I thought that she was a devotee,</i>
<i>but she is naughty.</i>

279
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,958
Mom, I lost my chocolate.

280
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,750
My goodness!

281
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,708
You steal the chocolate from a kid
and give me cold looks.

282
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,000
The ritual is done.

283
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:08,042
Circumambulate the temple
and take God's blessings.

284
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,833
<i>He is weirder than me.</i>

285
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,833
Looks like your curse is lifted.

286
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,292
I will be long gone
before this curse is lifted.

287
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,708
Chocolate thief!

288
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,458
Oh, no!

289
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,042
Someone threw a coconut shell
in the path! Waste fellow.

290
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:58,125
The coconut shell hurt your foot!

291
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,083
My bad time!

292
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,958
You did the same mistake.

293
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:29,167
Why do I get so flustered?

294
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,708
I'm behaving like an idiot.

295
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,375
<i>Must have made</i>
<i>a lasting impression on him.</i>

296
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:38,500
I can sell around 15 cars a day
if I tell stories like him.

297
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,750
But we don't have that much amount of cars
in the showroom.

298
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,167
Live in that fantasy world.

299
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,292
This is how you make tea.

300
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,167
Don't add sugar at the beginning.
Get it?

301
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,208
What is this place?

302
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,292
Appa Rao Peta.

303
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:02,333
It's been a while since I visited.

304
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:06,958
I wait here for Keerthi every day.

305
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,875
But she acts as if she doesn't know me.

306
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,250
What did you see in that stupid girl?

307
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,792
How did you even like her?

308
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:17,417
Hey! Why are you talking like that?

309
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,667
I like her.

310
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,458
What do I do?

311
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,292
I can only speak the truth.

312
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:28,833
What's all this horrible traffic in India?
The roads in the US are wide, you know.

313
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,750
Such nasty things happen only in India.

314
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,042
-Keerthi.
-Yeah?

315
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:38,042
Would you like to have <i>pani puri</i>?
It's good.

316
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:43,792
Eww! See how they dip their hands in
and out to serve <i>pani puri.</i>

317
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,167
Would you like to have some tea?
It's good.

318
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,792
Just a two-month trip to the US
and she's got an accent!

319
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:02,625
I come all the way here every day
only for you, Keerthi.

320
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,292
So what should I do about it?

321
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,250
Try to understand me.

322
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,833
Many guys try to impress me every day.

323
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:15,458
I don't have the time to remember them
or understand them.

324
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,708
I already told you.
I'm not so easily impressed.

325
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,708
She's acting too much.

326
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,333
I like you so much.

327
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:29,417
Why do you repeat the same thing?

328
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,167
I won't fall for you.

329
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,375
-Keerthi.
-What?

330
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,958
I got a technique, you know.

331
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,292
Any girl will easily fall for it.

332
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,792
What is that?

333
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,583
-Oh, God!
-Keerthi!

334
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,083
That's it.
It's that easy.

335
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:48,458
You monkey face! Nasty fellow!
Loafer! Go and die!

336
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:51,042
-Where did you find this fellow?
-Oh, no!

337
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:54,042
Hey, stupid fellow! Fool!
What happened to you?

338
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,000
Did you see that?
That is her original character.

339
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,417
Hey, shut up!

340
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:06,792
Hey!

341
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,208
<i>Maybe I'll see him today too.</i>

342
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:18,667
<i>I should wear something good.</i>

343
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
<i>No, I'll wear something normal.</i>

344
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:37,083
<i>I didn't wear this dress for him.</i>
<i>I did it for myself.</i>

345
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:41,583
<i>She smiles at me every day,</i>
<i>that's a sure positive sign.</i>

346
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's go for a coffee...

347
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,958
I see you every day.

348
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,167
You see me too.

349
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,458
You even smiled at me.

350
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:08,375
But you left as if you don't even know me.

351
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,583
Can I ask you something?

352
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:14,750
"What did you see in that girl?
How did you even like her?"

353
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,083
Hey!
This girl is not like your stupid girl.

354
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:19,292
Hey!

355
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,958
Idiot.

356
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,167
I should forget about her.

357
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,708
It's been just four days
and you are feeling sad.

358
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:30,208
What about me?

359
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:33,667
What about you?

360
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:35,583
That stupid girl got close to you.

361
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,583
Hey.

362
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,375
Forget about getting close.

363
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:45,667
I wonder what she thinks of me
after what you did.

364
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:47,625
Let her think whatever she wants.

365
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,750
What's with her abuses, man?

366
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:50,875
Is she even a girl?

367
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,667
Thanks for that day.

368
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,208
It's okay. No problem.

369
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,000
Whoa!

370
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,917
I need to talk to you
for a minute.

371
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,667
Yeah... Okay.

372
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:13,833
Should we go to that ice-cream parlor?

373
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:15,250
Yeah. Okay.

374
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,417
Hey! When is the party?

375
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,667
-Shut up.
-He's done!

376
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:28,458
<i>He brought a chocolate,</i>
<i>so he must be single.</i>

377
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,042
<i>Why does it matter to me?</i>
<i>Darn!</i>

378
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:40,292
Uncle...

379
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,375
Yes?

380
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,792
Do you know the tea stall guy
near the temple?

381
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,583
Yes, but why?

382
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,958
I need to take a boy's number from him.

383
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,208
Can we go there?

384
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,458
Okay.

385
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,333
No, let's go back.

386
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:55,833
Okay.

387
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,708
Actually, let's go there.

388
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,458
Okay.

389
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:06,042
No... Let's go back.

390
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:07,750
Okay.

391
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:21,333
It's me.

392
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,958
Can we meet once?

393
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,000
Chocolate thief?

394
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,208
Why did you change your mind
all of a sudden?

395
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,458
Let's meet for coffee.

396
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:32,833
Coffee!

397
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:36,333
When I first saw you, I thought
you were a God-fearing girl.

398
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:38,583
But later I realized
that you are a naughty girl.

399
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,167
But now I understood

400
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,958
that I never understood you,
and it's useless even to try it!

401
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:47,708
Tell me one thing.

402
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,833
Have you ever heard
about split personality?

403
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,792
Let's meet once.

404
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,375
Let's spend some time together.

405
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,458
But this will be temporary, okay?
We'll be friends.

406
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:00,583
Ouch!

407
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:02,458
You hurt me bad.

408
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,125
Since you said only friendship,
I am telling you this...

409
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,417
I'm attracted to you.

410
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,333
Hundred percent, pure attraction!

411
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,583
What's the problem with friendship?

412
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,292
There is no sincerity or any thrill in it.

413
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:18,958
Forget about friendship
and have a cup of coffee with me.

414
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,500
<i>Take a risk.</i>

415
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,458
One coffee, one kiss, one cigarette!

416
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:32,500
Many such bad habits

417
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,208
start with the word "one".

418
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:35,708
Such things happen at your age.

419
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,042
Everyone is controlled by hormones.

420
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:42,208
Whatever you think or decide or feel...

421
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:43,708
Everything is hormones.

422
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,583
Attack of the hormones!

423
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,833
<i>Such things happen at your age.</i>

424
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:59,458
<i>Everyone is controlled by hormones.</i>

425
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:17,458
Two coffees.

426
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:21,458
I cannot meet you again.

427
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,458
I met you just to say this.

428
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:25,167
Why?

429
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:26,583
What happened now?

430
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,458
You were fine till yesterday.

431
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:30,875
What is the actual problem?

432
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,250
What is your caste?

433
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:39,833
Your caste?

434
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,708
That is it.

435
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,042
Do you know what my caste is?

436
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:08,958
So what?

437
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,458
So, this can't happen.

438
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:12,583
It's a waste of time.

439
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,458
No one is getting us married right now.

440
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,583
Okay?
Let's continue meeting,

441
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,458
and see where this attraction takes us.

442
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,292
It won't take me anywhere.

443
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,583
But it will disappoint you for sure.

444
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:24,708
Oh!

445
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:25,958
Okay, then.

446
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,750
You will be in control.

447
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:28,958
I am the one at risk.

448
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:30,833
It's okay. No problem,
we'll continue meeting.

449
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,833
At least I will know how it feels
to go crazy in love.

450
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:38,917
I might never get that chance again.

451
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:40,833
<i>Not necessary, tell him no.</i>

452
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,708
But do not tell anyone about me.

453
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,458
Don't talk to anyone about us.

454
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,167
-Why?
-I don't like it.

455
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:52,458
And don't have any expectations,
you'll be disappointed.

456
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,625
Listen! I am telling you beforehand.

457
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,167
I am not committing to anything.

458
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,833
And I warned you
that you'd be at risk.

459
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,708
Are you scared,
or are you trying to scare me?

460
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:06,708
Okay, then.

461
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,625
One coffee, one movie,
one long drive! Okay?

462
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,042
The coffee part is already over.

463
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,458
You are cheating even before
the game has started, huh?

464
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:16,042
Everything is fair in...

465
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,125
Huh?

466
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:21,958
Let me pay.

467
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:35,125
<i>Is it? Is it true, my love?</i>

468
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:39,292
<i>Is it? Is it true?</i>

469
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:45,208
<i>Something has happened and changed me</i>

470
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:49,500
<i>I am totally lost</i>

471
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:55,292
<i>This looks like a dream and a reality too</i>

472
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:56,958
Which movie should we watch?

473
00:32:57,958 --> 00:32:59,583
Any good movie is fine.

474
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:06,292
<i>What can I do? This age is such...</i>

475
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:07,875
Hormones are to be blamed.

476
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:12,292
<i>You make me smile, my love</i>

477
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:41,042
Two tickets.

478
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:51,458
Give it to me.

479
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:53,958
It's okay.

480
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:02,292
I will pay you double the price,
give me your tickets.

481
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,292
No. Try somewhere else.

482
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,875
Sir, please. Give them to me.

483
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:06,917
No.

484
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:09,167
We won't.
Go away, man.

485
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:11,292
Mr. Rao.

486
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,333
Why do you act as if I'm asking
for your kidney or liver?

487
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,167
It's just the tickets I'm asking for.

488
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,292
That is my wish.

489
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:18,583
I will not give.

490
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,583
Are you out of your mind?

491
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,500
We finally found time
from our busy schedules...

492
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,625
You act as if you are
the prime minister of India.

493
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,958
I'm sure you are a bank employee.

494
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,708
You can watch the movie tomorrow.

495
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,458
Or the day after.

496
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,208
It'd be fine if you don't watch it.

497
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,500
Get lost from here.

498
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,042
Hey!

499
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,167
-Come.
-Wait, rascal!

500
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,625
Mr. Rao!
I'll return the favor someday.

501
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:55,375
<i>Would you even listen to me?</i>

502
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:59,958
<i>You're trying to cross the line, my heart</i>

503
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:05,625
<i>The thought of restraining it this way</i>

504
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:09,500
<i>Is a mistake, you know</i>

505
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:16,000
<i>I think I'm losing my heart to you</i>

506
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:20,708
<i>The story has changed from today</i>

507
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:26,125
<i>It seems like an unbelievable wonder</i>

508
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:30,917
<i>I can't take all this</i>
<i>Uncontrollable happiness at once</i>

509
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,708
<i>Until you get over all your hesitation</i>

510
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:40,583
<i>With a smile, you can't reach the skies</i>

511
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,958
Why are you calling me repeatedly?
What is it?

512
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,458
What's the matter?

513
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:52,958
Arundhati?

514
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:54,958
Say hi to Harathi.

515
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:07,833
Why didn't you call me for two days?

516
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:23,583
<i>I followed my thoughts for the first time</i>

517
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:26,167
<i>It feels so good</i>

518
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:30,875
<i>Once you start chasing your dreams</i>

519
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:35,333
<i>You won't have enough dreams</i>

520
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:40,958
<i>Hasn't the world seen me yet?</i>

521
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:45,958
<i>Maybe you didn't reach for it</i>

522
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:51,458
<i>The change is new</i>
<i>It is taking me on a new way</i>

523
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:56,250
<i>But if I get too close to him</i>
<i>I might end up falling in love</i>

524
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,958
<i>It is inevitable, it is not wrong</i>

525
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:01,500
<i>There is no problem</i>

526
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:06,583
<i>Come with me and know yourself</i>

527
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,583
-Hari?
-Hmm.

528
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,042
Why do you like me?

529
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,583
Am I that good looking?

530
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:15,833
I don't know.

531
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,708
Did you understand what I asked?

532
00:37:19,042 --> 00:37:20,458
Don't I look good?

533
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:21,583
I really don't know.

534
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:23,583
I find you interesting. That's it.

535
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
How?

536
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:28,250
I tried to impress one girl,
but I got two.

537
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,167
Harathi and Arundhati!

538
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:40,458
<i>Is it? Is it true, my love?</i>

539
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:44,833
<i>Is it? Is it true?</i>

540
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:50,167
<i>Something has happened and changed me</i>

541
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:54,708
<i>I am totally lost</i>

542
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,042
How did you like my town?

543
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,833
It's beautiful.

544
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,292
I like exploring places.

545
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,292
Do you know what my dream destination is?

546
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,167
The Himalayas!

547
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,458
But it won't happen.

548
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,583
I really like Harathi.

549
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,958
I wish she likes me too.

550
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:26,042
I met her without any expectations.

551
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,292
I don't know why...

552
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,958
I feel good when Harathi is with me.

553
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,000
I want Keerthi.

554
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,625
I love her more with each passing day.

555
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,042
I am talking about a girl
who is very difficult to impress.

556
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,667
-Not a girl whom anyone can impress.
-Hey! Idiot!

557
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,833
Why does your husband
skip walking all the time?

558
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,458
It's nothing like that.
He has an inspection today...

559
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:53,625
He left early in the morning.

560
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,625
I dropped Chintu at school and came.

561
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,958
Okay. There is a prayer at my house
the day after tomorrow. Don't forget.

562
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:58,958
Okay, brother.

563
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:00,000
-Coffee.
-Are you doing well?

564
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,292
I'm doing well.

565
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,125
I have decided
to find a match for Harathi.

566
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,292
Tell me if there is someone.

567
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,958
There are many people from our caste.

568
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,042
Let's see.

569
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,125
Who would refuse an alliance
with your family?

570
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:15,542
Sister! Let's tell uncle.

571
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,458
I'll talk to Kusuma and Bhramaramba.

572
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:19,458
-They know some people.
-Okay.

573
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:25,750
<i>A kiss reaches the heart</i>

574
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:27,833
<i>Just one kiss...</i>

575
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,583
Harathi. Sita called early in the morning.

576
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:40,250
Yes, Dad.

577
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:43,042
-Were you sleeping?
-No, Dad. Tell me.

578
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,333
I'm planning to get you married.

579
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:46,958
<i>Are you okay with it?</i>

580
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:50,000
Hello. Harathi.

581
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,667
Dad.

582
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,583
Everything is good from your side, right?

583
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:54,958
Yes.

584
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:56,042
Okay.

585
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:58,583
<i>You can check out the options</i>
<i>after you come back home.</i>

586
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,167
Okay.

587
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,917
<i>I knew this would happen.</i>

588
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,792
<i>Why did I still lose control?</i>

589
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,833
<i>Can I ever tell Dad that I like someone?</i>

590
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,625
<i>No. It will be a big problem.</i>

591
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,042
<i>Why does he keep calling</i>
<i>even after I disconnect the call?</i>

592
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,583
Who is calling you at this hour?

593
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:52,833
My friend.

594
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:06,292
Don't you have any sense?

595
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,458
Why did you call me so late at night?

596
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:10,708
Do you even know what I have to face?

597
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,458
The kind of situations I face,
the kind of pressures I have...

598
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:15,583
Why don't you think about it?

599
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:19,458
Okay. This is the last time
I am meeting you.

600
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:32,458
By the way, what's so important?

601
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,167
Listen to this once.

602
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:42,125
<i>A kiss reaches the heart</i>

603
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,083
<i>Just one kiss...</i>

604
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,958
It's a great line, isn't it?

605
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:49,958
"A kiss reaches the heart, it seems."

606
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:52,167
Oh! Did you discover it?

607
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:55,000
Is that why you called me
so many times last night?

608
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:59,042
No matter what happens around you,
you'll be in your world.

609
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,292
You are simply crazy.

610
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,708
That's what love is, right?

611
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:03,292
What a feeling!

612
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,583
Don't you want to experience it?

613
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,958
Don't you feel anything?

614
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,417
Do you know what time
you called me last night?

615
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,083
I was lost in this amazing feeling...

616
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:15,583
I didn't have time to check the time.

617
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:17,917
What now?

618
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,833
Will you become impure if I touch you?

619
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,500
You have totally lost it.

620
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:28,375
It's nothing like that.
Just keep your hands to yourself.

621
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:31,583
You're a principled person.
That makes me like you even more.

622
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,167
You're a strange person.

623
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,375
I didn't say that
to make you feel something.

624
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,083
I am leaving tomorrow.

625
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:47,833
For Nellore.

626
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:50,208
To attend a wedding.

627
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:52,583
Then...

628
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:54,708
When will you come back?

629
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,208
In a week.

630
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:02,958
-Anil.
-Hmm.

631
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:04,833
You have to drop me home today.

632
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:06,083
Where is your bike?

633
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,583
My bike...

634
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:12,000
I ran out of fuel, so I parked it
at the nearby police station.

635
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:15,833
You were caught for drunk driving,
and you are trying to cover it up.

636
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,792
I have never missed anyone
like this before.

637
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,083
I want to marry her.

638
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:33,708
But...

639
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:34,708
But what?

640
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:35,958
What's the problem?

641
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,708
She likes me.

642
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,375
But I am not sure if she loves me.

643
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:44,708
I don't even know
if I am important to her.

644
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:47,958
It's okay.

645
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,500
I will keep trying.

646
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,833
Bro! She is simply playing with you.

647
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:53,375
Don't be so desperate...

648
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:54,833
Crazy fellow.

649
00:43:55,292 --> 00:43:56,708
She will definitely dump you.

650
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,333
Let me meet her once...

651
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:01,375
I will ask her
why she is playing with you.

652
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:02,708
What say?

653
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:06,083
Hey! Pay the fine and get your bike.

654
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:22,083
What is it? A gift?

655
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,208
It's just average.

656
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:37,167
I never gave a gift to anyone
in my entire life.

657
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,833
I did it for you,
and you say it's average.

658
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:41,458
I didn't say that
to make you feel something.

659
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:44,208
Is it?

660
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,208
Okay.

661
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:47,083
Wear this sari
for your friend's wedding.

662
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,000
If eight out of ten people
don't appreciate it,

663
00:44:50,292 --> 00:44:52,333
-I will stop chasing you.
-Yeah. Done!

664
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,958
But if eight people say it's good,

665
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:56,708
you have to kiss me.

666
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,083
Take that bouquet.

667
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:36,458
Tell me, dear.

668
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:37,583
-Dad.
<i>-Yes.</i>

669
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:41,708
I want to stay with Aunt Neelima
for two more weeks in Kalahasti.

670
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,125
Is it okay?

671
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,167
Okay.

672
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,083
<i>-What else? How is the wedding?</i>
-It's going good.

673
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,375
<i>-All right.</i>
-Okay.

674
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:13,250
Why did you come here?

675
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:14,667
Did you forget about our bet?

676
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:16,167
What if you cheat me?

677
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:18,208
Don't you trust me?

678
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:20,083
It's not about trust...

679
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,917
It's about how far you can go for a bet
and how far I can come for a kiss.

680
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:26,208
I came this far.
Let's see if you will win.

681
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:29,375
What is that?

682
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Who's camera?

683
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:33,708
The cameraman's.

684
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:35,958
The camera went missing
when I went to have breakfast.

685
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:38,583
-Your sari is amazing!
-Shh!

686
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:39,917
What did you say?

687
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,833
-I said that her sari looks good.
-Right?

688
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,708
She said your sari looks good.

689
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,375
Sister! Your sari is awesome.

690
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,500
One. Two. That's for me.

691
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,375
You got zero.

692
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,833
<i>It's a good time</i>

693
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,125
<i>Why should we worry?</i>

694
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:09,500
<i>Like this</i>

695
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:12,208
<i>Oh, my girl</i>

696
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:17,875
<i>You are so lovable</i>

697
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,375
<i>How?</i>

698
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:22,083
<i>Yet how?</i>

699
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:25,250
<i>I'll be in deep trouble</i>

700
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:27,750
<i>If no one says I don't look good</i>

701
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:32,167
<i>How? Yet how?</i>

702
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,042
<i>This sari got me into trouble</i>

703
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,500
<i>How do I win this bet?</i>

704
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:42,083
<i>How? Yet how?</i>

705
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:45,000
<i>In a floral garden</i>

706
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:47,292
<i>It's a lovely game</i>

707
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:50,833
<i>It's a celebration</i>

708
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,833
<i>Oh, my pretty doll</i>

709
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,083
<i>You are in trouble</i>

710
00:47:57,167 --> 00:48:00,792
<i>See what happens</i>

711
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:29,083
<i>Oh, beauty with beautiful eyes</i>

712
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:31,500
<i>Why are you worried?</i>

713
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,042
<i>Do not show your anger on me</i>

714
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:36,375
<i>Give a smile whole heartedly</i>

715
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:41,083
<i>There isn't any magic</i>
<i>That can save you from failure</i>

716
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,875
<i>The gift I so fondly gave you</i>

717
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:45,958
<i>Is going to bring me luck</i>

718
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:49,583
-Aunty.
-What?

719
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:51,583
-My sari?
-It's not good.

720
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,500
Hey! Your sari...

721
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,833
-It's bad.
-Right?

722
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:10,583
<i>You planned big for a small kiss?</i>

723
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:15,542
<i>You'll be out if I get the next point</i>

724
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:20,417
<i>Stop being stubborn with this beauty</i>

725
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,083
<i>Stop staring at me</i>

726
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:27,208
<i>You'll be in deep trouble</i>
<i>If no one says you don't look good</i>

727
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:28,208
Wow!

728
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,042
Your sari is beautiful!

729
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,583
Aunt! See her sari.

730
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:37,458
<i>This sari got you into trouble</i>

731
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:39,917
<i>How will you win this bet?</i>

732
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,417
<i>How? Yet how?</i>

733
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,958
Sister! Your sari is good.

734
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:10,417
<i>It's a good time</i>
<i>Why should we worry?</i>

735
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:13,250
Sister! Your sari is very good.

736
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:16,375
<i>Yes! Why did she say that again?</i>

737
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,167
<i>She must've really liked the sari.</i>

738
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:23,375
<i>How? Yet how?</i>

739
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,500
<i>I'll be in deep trouble</i>

740
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:28,875
<i>If no one says I don't look good</i>

741
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:30,583
<i>How?</i>

742
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:33,625
<i>Yet how?</i>

743
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:36,250
<i>This sari got me into trouble</i>

744
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,750
<i>How do I win this bet?</i>

745
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:42,542
<i>How? Yet how?</i>

746
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,208
<i>In a floral garden</i>

747
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,417
<i>It's a lovely game</i>

748
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:52,250
<i>It's a celebration</i>

749
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:58,208
<i>Oh, my pretty girl</i>

750
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:02,500
<i>You are in trouble</i>
<i>See what happens now</i>

751
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,958
You...

752
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,583
It would have been nice
if you were from our caste.

753
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:38,917
What?

754
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:40,833
Nothing.

755
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:43,500
I am saying that you are getting
too desperate.

756
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,500
My friend Babji said the same.

757
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:49,583
He says that I've become crazy.

758
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:52,000
If you continue treating me like this,

759
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:53,583
he will come to talk to you.

760
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:55,375
Think about it.

761
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:56,583
What say?

762
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:07,083
Hari.

763
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:15,333
What are you doing here?

764
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:16,833
Is there any problem?

765
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:18,750
You asked me for a kiss, didn't you?

766
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:20,083
That's why I am here.

767
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,917
I did...

768
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:23,833
But this is a little unexpected.

769
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:26,250
Hari.

770
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:27,833
Will you kiss me?

771
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:32,375
There is something else.
Tell me about that.

772
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,833
Our time is over, Hari.

773
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:39,958
I am going back home.

774
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:56,250
You were very careful and did exactly
what you said since the beginning.

775
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,375
I was a fool that I didn't realize it.

776
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:11,375
Did you really feel nothing for me
all these days?

777
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:29,208
I didn't have much time.

778
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:30,917
I told you so.

779
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:35,792
I was attracted to you
since the beginning.

780
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,208
I knew that this would be temporary.
Still, I called you.

781
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:42,792
I met you even after I knew
that I shouldn't meet you.

782
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:47,292
I liked you so much that I got scared.

783
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:49,833
Me, my rules...

784
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,792
And the promises I made to my parents.

785
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:54,125
I might break all of those.

786
00:53:55,292 --> 00:53:58,250
So I even lied to you about myself.

787
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:06,625
My life is very complicated, Hari.

788
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,667
My dad is too stubborn.

789
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:12,292
It is impossible to change him
in matters of caste.

790
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,208
And when you are with me...

791
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:17,250
I cannot think clearly.

792
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:20,208
That's why this is the right thing.

793
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:25,875
Do you know how important you are to me?

794
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:31,167
Freedom and happiness
were long gone from my life.

795
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:34,375
I experienced happiness again
after you came into my life.

796
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:36,708
You shouldn't have come.

797
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:41,208
I would have adjusted to life
if you hadn't come.

798
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,375
I would have never known this happiness.

799
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,583
Now see what happened.

800
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:49,375
I have to compromise again.

801
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:54,375
What have you done to me, Hari?

802
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,792
You asked me to take a risk.

803
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,375
I did.

804
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:00,375
This is the result.

805
00:55:07,917 --> 00:55:09,208
I am very lucky.

806
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:13,583
I experienced love because of you.

807
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:15,917
Yes, Hari.

808
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:17,958
I am crazy about you.

809
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:27,208
I can feel it.

810
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,208
Losing you will be
the biggest regret of my life.

811
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,500
Going away from you...

812
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:39,833
is really hard.

813
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:48,208
I've realized that you too
feel the same for me.

814
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:51,167
So if I delay it any more...

815
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:55,292
That's why I took a decision.

816
00:55:56,542 --> 00:55:58,042
To make this easy on you...

817
00:55:58,583 --> 00:56:01,375
I always hid the details
about my family and me.

818
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:05,417
My name and phone number...
are all lies.

819
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:11,417
This ends here.

820
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:13,917
I am leaving.

821
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:26,583
Visakhapatnam

822
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:32,833
Boo!

823
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:34,500
Oh! It's you!

824
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:36,500
Why do you get so scared?

825
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,708
You scared me, man.

826
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:48,167
Why haven't you been answering calls
for two days?

827
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:49,375
Hey.

828
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:51,375
Harathi loves me.

829
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:52,958
She told me herself.

830
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:56,208
You guys said that
she's just playing with me.

831
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:57,708
See!

832
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:00,958
Hey!

833
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:03,708
We are in love, man.
We are going to get married.

834
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:05,583
Do you understand?

835
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:08,875
But she said it is impossible
to convince her father.

836
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,208
I don't care.

837
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,708
Harathi loves me.

838
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:13,208
That is enough for me.

839
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:14,500
<i>I will marry her at any cost.</i>

840
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:17,833
Chinni. Aunt Rekha sent us
photos of grooms. Look.

841
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,000
Did you bring every guy's photo
from the town or what?

842
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,417
Give me your e-mail ID first.

843
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,667
I do not have an e-mail ID,
and they are bothering me.

844
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:24,625
<i>Okay.</i>

845
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,208
I have to find Harathi's address
at any cost.

846
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:49,250
She took the photos from me
but didn't give her opinion.

847
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:51,667
It's okay. Her curse is gone.

848
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,917
Everything will be good now.
Don't worry.

849
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:56,500
The curse is gone, but the hormones
are still there, right?

850
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,208
Your hormones are the curse.

851
00:57:58,417 --> 00:57:59,583
<i>Not again.</i>

852
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:00,625
Mom.

853
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:02,917
I need some time
to check out these photos.

854
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:04,583
Okay.

855
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:16,375
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

856
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,583
I shouldn't have fallen for him.

857
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:31,958
<i>Why didn't I ever question Dad</i>
<i>about his weakness?</i>

858
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:35,792
<i>Dad! I will befriend whomever I like.</i>
<i>It is my wish.</i>

859
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:38,375
<i>Why couldn't I ever tell him that?</i>

860
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:40,625
<i>That is why I got this punishment.</i>

861
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:50,542
We should shed our ego before God...

862
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:54,583
<i>I have to somehow handle this depression.</i>

863
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:56,417
It means...

864
00:58:58,583 --> 00:58:59,500
Mom.

865
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:00,708
I didn't like any of them.

866
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:12,042
-Brother.
-Tell me.

867
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:14,708
My friend came here with his girlfriend
on November 24th.

868
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:16,333
Now he met with an accident.

869
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:17,875
We don't have contact details
of that girl.

870
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:18,917
There is only one clue.

871
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,875
That girl paid the bill with her card
when they came here.

872
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,708
If you give me a duplicate bill, I can
find that girl's address from the bank.

873
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:25,208
We can't give the details, sir.

874
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,542
She will not know
if something happens to my friend.

875
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:34,833
She won't be able to see him
one last time.

876
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,500
That may impact her negatively.

877
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:37,958
You'll be responsible for it.

878
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:40,708
One minute.

879
00:59:43,167 --> 00:59:46,125
Verify the records of personal loans
and vehicle loans.

880
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:49,125
Tell me.

881
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:54,708
Sir, my friend is hurt.

882
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,208
He injured his heart in an accident.

883
00:59:57,583 --> 00:59:59,583
He is in a coma.
I need your help.

884
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:01,500
I think I have seen you somewhere.

885
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,125
Not a chance.

886
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:05,500
Definitely. I feel we've met earlier.

887
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:12,083
I want the card details of this bill.

888
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:14,583
It's a serious love matter.
Please, sir. Help us.

889
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,167
I will definitely return the favor.

890
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:20,625
You said that
at the movie theater too, right?

891
01:00:20,792 --> 01:00:21,958
<i>Damn!</i>

892
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,208
Get out of here.

893
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:30,917
I am extremely sorry.

894
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,250
I didn't know that I'd need you
in the future.

895
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:35,875
-Damn!
-Venkat, send him away!

896
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:37,875
-Sir, really... Please...
-Venkat! Wait a minute.

897
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,458
I said that you are just a bank employee.

898
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:43,542
I never imagined that you
would be a bank manager.

899
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:45,000
-Come out, sir. Please.
-Venkat, wait a minute.

900
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:45,917
Please, come out.

901
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,208
-I've regretted my actions so much...
-Sir!

902
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:05,083
Hello, sir. Hello.

903
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,125
Sir...

904
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:35,750
I like a girl.

905
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:38,083
I'll be able to find her if you help.

906
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:39,833
That is why I was following you.

907
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,083
I am sorry for whatever I did.

908
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,958
Hey...

909
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:11,208
Come in.

910
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:15,792
Yes!

911
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:24,375
Why didn't she like anyone?

912
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:29,875
I've been noticing her ever since
she came back from that wedding.

913
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,708
Something happened there.

914
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:38,708
I don't know what to do.

915
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:42,458
Ask her to see these photos.

916
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,500
Here. Aunt Sita got these photos.

917
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:53,583
See them calmly.

918
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:55,500
You might like someone.

919
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:24,500
I cannot take it anymore.

920
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:26,583
I wish Hari comes here.

921
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,208
I'm ready to do anything
for that to happen.

922
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:44,083
My life will remain like this
if I do nothing.

923
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:47,208
I don't care.
I'll ask Hari to come here.

924
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:17,375
<i>He lied about his caste.</i>

925
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:24,375
He is good looking, isn't he?
Do you like him?

926
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,958
No! I don't like him.

927
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:43,708
She likes a boy.

928
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,708
Dear, do you like this boy?

929
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:55,958
I don't like him.

930
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,500
She definitely likes the boy.

931
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,375
But for some reason...

932
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:15,250
Why didn't she like that guy?

933
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:16,375
I don't know, man.

934
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:18,708
This guy.

935
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,583
Oh! They are considering him
for my relative's daughter.

936
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,292
He is a very eligible guy, it seems.

937
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,708
Let's see who will get him.

938
01:05:30,917 --> 01:05:32,833
<i>If you want peace of mind,</i>

939
01:05:32,917 --> 01:05:38,417
it is better not to discuss
others' personal lives.

940
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:42,125
Does anyone have any doubt?

941
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:43,583
-I have a doubt.
-Yeah. Tell me.

942
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:44,833
Guru.

943
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,583
I like one girl.

944
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,167
She lied to me
that she gave me a false name.

945
01:05:49,667 --> 01:05:51,417
I wanted to kiss her.

946
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:53,500
She agreed to it.

947
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:57,292
Ever since she agreed to it,
I think about it all the time.

948
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:00,833
She promised to kiss me,
and she just disappeared.

949
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,958
That's why I came here.

950
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:06,500
Is this a place to talk about such things?

951
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:11,750
Moreover, true love is to wish
for the other person's happiness.

952
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:13,500
Not wishing something from them.

953
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:15,583
Is it wrong to wish for something
with love?

954
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,125
No, no. Yours is not love.

955
01:06:18,292 --> 01:06:19,500
They call it something else.

956
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:21,833
We don't have a solution for that.

957
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:24,708
Do I look like that?

958
01:06:26,958 --> 01:06:27,833
Fine.

959
01:06:28,042 --> 01:06:29,208
I am promising in your presence.

960
01:06:29,292 --> 01:06:31,375
I will never bring up such topics
with her again.

961
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:32,958
I swear on you.

962
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:36,375
How did you find me?

963
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:39,125
-How did this happen?
-I lied about my horoscope and caste.

964
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:42,125
You lied for love.
I lied for marriage.

965
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:43,833
Ours is a perfect love marriage.

966
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,875
What about the mediators
and the marriage bureau?

967
01:06:47,042 --> 01:06:49,583
Forget about that.
Tell me what your family said.

968
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:51,917
That's what I don't understand...

969
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,500
How did this happen?

970
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:54,833
Don't worry.

971
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,208
-I'll sort it out.
-You are out of your mind.

972
01:06:57,458 --> 01:07:00,250
This is the worst idea.
It's good that I rejected you.

973
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:02,833
Otherwise, what will happen
if Dad finds out about us?

974
01:07:02,917 --> 01:07:03,833
Oh, no!

975
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:07,167
You rejected me?

976
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,333
-Why?
-What do you mean "why"?

977
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,750
Marriage involves a lot of things.

978
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,667
If you lie about everything like this,
our truth will be out soon.

979
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,458
Maybe when the families meet
or while sending wedding invites.

980
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:18,167
Or there might be a big mess
at the wedding.

981
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,958
Do you realize what a big nuisance
that will be?

982
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,500
I don't know if it is right or wrong,
but I took a step...

983
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:32,083
I made it look like an arranged marriage,
so that no one finds out about us.

984
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:36,708
When there is no other way out,
it doesn't matter what we do.

985
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:38,042
We have nothing to lose.

986
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:39,583
Let's try this.

987
01:07:41,417 --> 01:07:44,458
-No, I won't support it.
-Oh, God!

988
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:48,625
It seems that guy is very good.

989
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:51,083
Think about it.

990
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:53,417
This guy?

991
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,583
My friends told me a lot about him.

992
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:57,375
Many people are considering him
for their daughters.

993
01:07:57,542 --> 01:07:59,083
You have to do something soon.

994
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:00,708
Did Harathi say anything?

995
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:07,500
<i>Tell me.</i>

996
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,500
How do my relatives know you?

997
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:11,792
Everyone is saying good things
about you.

998
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:14,458
Is that a problem for you?

999
01:08:14,792 --> 01:08:16,583
Should I go away?
Should I die?

1000
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:20,083
The situation is favorable...

1001
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:21,708
Why are you behaving like this?

1002
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,708
Oh... Damn!

1003
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,083
Hari.

1004
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:36,958
It's... My dad...

1005
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:40,583
Dad! Dad! Dad!
What is it about your dad?

1006
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,458
What if my dad finds out about us?

1007
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,583
Your dad will never know about us.

1008
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:49,708
I'll act as if I don't know you
even after we get married. Okay?

1009
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:55,208
He will be heartbroken
if he finds out.

1010
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:58,958
I am not sure whether this plan
will work or not.

1011
01:08:59,042 --> 01:09:00,833
That's why I was rude to you last night.

1012
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:04,083
You behave like a totally
different person sometimes.

1013
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:05,708
Do you do it intentionally?

1014
01:09:06,667 --> 01:09:09,833
By the way, nobody just comes home
with a marriage proposal.

1015
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:11,500
How did you reach our family?

1016
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:13,750
I swam to your place.

1017
01:09:14,542 --> 01:09:17,000
I found someone to help me.
I will explain all that later.

1018
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,625
First, go home and say "yes".

1019
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,250
I don't think it will work.

1020
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Damn!

1021
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,000
<i>Tell me.</i>

1022
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:34,875
<i>They say all our wishes will come true</i>
<i>if we perform the Ayyappa Ritual.</i>

1023
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:38,375
<i>Madhu's brother married his girlfriend</i>
<i>after he performed the ritual.</i>

1024
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:40,375
You want me to perform the ritual now?

1025
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,375
Have you totally lost it?

1026
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:44,917
<i>What's the connection between</i>
<i>Ayyappa Ritual and marriage?</i>

1027
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:46,667
Don't you think it's too much?

1028
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,208
<i>At least try to say</i>
<i>Swami Ayyappa's Prayer.</i>

1029
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,083
Why are you behaving
like my mom suddenly?

1030
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:53,250
<i>No! You don't get it.</i>

1031
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:55,750
<i>Your sins will be forgiven</i>
<i>and you'll prosper.</i>

1032
01:09:57,042 --> 01:09:57,958
Look!

1033
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:00,750
Prayers won't help us.

1034
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:03,583
We are not getting married
because you are delaying it.

1035
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:05,375
<i>Otherwise, we would've been</i>
<i>married by now.</i>

1036
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:08,583
<i>Actually, I rejected you,</i>
<i>but my parents are fixated on you.</i>

1037
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:10,958
<i>The more I deny,</i>
<i>the more they lean toward you.</i>

1038
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:13,833
<i>Especially my aunt and uncle</i>
<i>like you a lot.</i>

1039
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:16,000
Then what are you waiting for?

1040
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:17,625
<i>I have my doubts.</i>

1041
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:21,458
Harathi. Those aren't doubts...

1042
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:23,500
That's madness.

1043
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
You say she likes him.

1044
01:10:26,542 --> 01:10:28,000
She says she doesn't like anyone.

1045
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,250
I think both are wrong.

1046
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:34,792
She loves someone.

1047
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:38,083
If something like that happens...

1048
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:43,375
Just say yes.

1049
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:44,917
He is a very eligible guy.

1050
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,375
He has a good job.
All of us like him.

1051
01:10:47,667 --> 01:10:49,708
Don't think too much and say yes.

1052
01:10:49,792 --> 01:10:51,750
Otherwise, your dad will be angry.

1053
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:55,292
<i>You'll have a heart attack</i>
<i>if I tell you the truth.</i>

1054
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,292
Sister.

1055
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:58,917
-The groom's father is from our hometown.
-Is it?

1056
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,375
He lost his father at a very young age.

1057
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:02,500
The only son.

1058
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:06,000
They left this place because they
didn't have any relatives here.

1059
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:08,417
His grandfather is a well-known man there.

1060
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,667
Is it? That is good news.

1061
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,792
This alliance should be confirmed
with God's grace.

1062
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:15,500
Yes, I was very surprised to hear it.

1063
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,292
I have to meet you.

1064
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:30,917
Now they are saying that your grandpa
is from my mom's hometown. Huh?

1065
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:33,125
Forget about that.

1066
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:34,792
First say yes to your parents.

1067
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:37,083
No! Tell me, what did you tell everyone?

1068
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:39,542
What's your plan? What did you do?
Tell me everything.

1069
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,667
You won't accept it if I say what I did.

1070
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:44,042
Who says I'll accept it now?
It's all okay, tell me.

1071
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:48,625
I already told you.
A good man helped me.

1072
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:57,750
Because of your dad's obsession,
I was clueless about what to do.

1073
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,750
<i>I asked a lot of people about your dad.</i>

1074
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,833
<i>I visited his site too.</i>

1075
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:07,833
<i>I got to know many interesting things.</i>

1076
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:10,500
<i>That's when I realized</i>
<i>why you are like this.</i>

1077
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:12,458
<i>Then I slowly understood everything.</i>

1078
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,208
<i>We already have the caste problem.</i>

1079
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:17,875
<i>It's impossible to convince your family</i>
<i>to get us married.</i>

1080
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,833
<i>I was totally frustrated.</i>

1081
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:27,500
We should give shock treatment
to her dad.

1082
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,292
He'll come to his senses.

1083
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,917
In fact, everyone against love marriages
should be given shock treatment.

1084
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Meals!

1085
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:40,333
What is this, son?

1086
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:45,083
If you don't mind me asking you,
what is your caste?

1087
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,500
We are...

1088
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:47,958
<i>Harathi's caste!</i>

1089
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:49,750
I'm from the same caste too.

1090
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:51,417
I have a government job.

1091
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:54,500
I got posted in Coastal Andhra
for four months.

1092
01:12:54,667 --> 01:12:55,583
Six districts.

1093
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:57,500
I don't remember how many places
I have been to.

1094
01:12:57,792 --> 01:13:00,125
I got an idea while doing the survey.

1095
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:02,833
To collect information about our people
and make a caste tree.

1096
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:04,750
It's like a family tree.

1097
01:13:04,917 --> 01:13:06,542
I have everyone's details.

1098
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:08,500
I just have to cross-check the details.

1099
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:12,083
See! I took that information
and prepared this caste tree.

1100
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:14,625
You can check back up to ten generations.

1101
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:18,000
All of us came down from eight families.

1102
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:19,833
-I will be right back.
-Okay.

1103
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,708
Yeah, Anil. Tell me.

1104
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,083
What do you want to achieve by this?

1105
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:29,417
I want to gather all my people
and know about them.

1106
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:32,625
So nobody is going to benefit from it.

1107
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:33,583
They will.

1108
01:13:33,667 --> 01:13:36,083
Everyone will be interested to know
about their past.

1109
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,333
Yeah.

1110
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:39,750
Yeah, someone who is jobless
or worthless would want that.

1111
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:41,750
It is very good. Excellent idea!

1112
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,625
Anil, I met a guy just now.

1113
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,083
He is very sharp.

1114
01:13:47,167 --> 01:13:49,500
He is making a caste tree of our people.

1115
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:51,333
<i>Are people losing their minds?</i>

1116
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:53,833
Tell me.

1117
01:13:53,917 --> 01:13:56,625
Tell me your great grandfather's name
or his father's name.

1118
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,250
It's difficult to get his father's name...

1119
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,833
There are so many problems
because of the caste system,

1120
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
and he is doing research
to build a caste tree.

1121
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:06,458
His charts and books should be burned.

1122
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,500
<i>The next day I attended a wedding</i>
<i>between people of your caste.</i>

1123
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,875
It has been many days.

1124
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,917
What's going on?
Is everyone doing well at home?

1125
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:23,625
Hmm.

1126
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:34,083
I'm Hari.

1127
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:37,333
I gathered information about our people
and made a caste tree!

1128
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,083
This is the caste tree.
Family tree.

1129
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:51,208
You can check back up
to ten generations of our people.

1130
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:53,750
We can find all our relatives.

1131
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:58,583
That's only one part.

1132
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:01,250
I am creating a mobile app
with this information.

1133
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:02,750
<i>Hey!</i>

1134
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:06,250
Type your name and last name, you'll see
all the information on your phone.

1135
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:09,917
People from US, UK or other places
can also check.

1136
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,833
Do you know coding too?

1137
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,000
<i>Codi... what? What is that?</i>

1138
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:17,500
It is coding.

1139
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:19,500
-He knows it.
-Oh, yeah.

1140
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,833
The coding is almost ready for this.

1141
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:28,000
Can we also find unmarried girls
through this app?

1142
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:31,625
Forget that.

1143
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:35,333
With this app, I'll make sure
we find the whereabouts of our people.

1144
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:40,250
Where and how they are settled across
the world and what they've achieved.

1145
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:43,458
I'll add our caste name with our names
in Facebook IDs.

1146
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:45,917
College names, Twitter tweets,
WhatsApp and Instagram...

1147
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,333
I'll make our caste renowned.

1148
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:50,000
I'll show our strength to the world.

1149
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:52,625
I'll set up a worldwide reunion
for all our people.

1150
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:54,333
And I'll uphold our self-respect.

1151
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,708
<i>This guy is multi-talented.</i>

1152
01:15:57,792 --> 01:16:00,000
<i>I have to fix him up with Pavani.</i>

1153
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:02,625
Are you married, dear?

1154
01:16:02,875 --> 01:16:04,958
My niece is of marriageable age.

1155
01:16:05,042 --> 01:16:06,375
If you are interested...

1156
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:08,333
<i>This is going off track.</i>

1157
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:12,042
Actually, my parents are already
looking for a bride for me.

1158
01:16:15,208 --> 01:16:18,292
<i>I gained such popularity</i>
<i>among your people,</i>

1159
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:21,375
<i>rejected all the matches that I got,</i>

1160
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:24,958
faked my father's name
with the help of that caste tree...

1161
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:29,083
linked it with a missing family
from your mother's hometown,

1162
01:16:29,792 --> 01:16:30,833
and reached you.

1163
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:42,083
I am 99 percent sure
that this plan will fail.

1164
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:44,333
I thought that you'd told a small lie.

1165
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,625
I didn't imagine such a big scam.

1166
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:57,083
Mom.

1167
01:16:57,667 --> 01:16:59,000
I like that guy.

1168
01:16:59,542 --> 01:17:00,542
Fix the alliance.

1169
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:12,833
Can you come with me for four days
without asking any questions?

1170
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:31,708
<i>There's no way to stop</i>

1171
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:35,167
<i>The happiness I'm feeling</i>

1172
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:38,708
<i>I cannot believe</i>

1173
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:42,417
<i>In this magical moment</i>

1174
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:46,042
<i>Let there be an earthquake</i>
<i>Let the earth be gone</i>

1175
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:49,375
<i>There's no way to stop this happiness</i>

1176
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:52,958
<i>No matter what, this is a lifelong joy</i>

1177
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:56,208
<i>Come, let us get it, my love</i>

1178
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:14,208
<i>Hey! There's no way to stop</i>

1179
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,875
<i>The happiness I'm feeling</i>

1180
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:21,500
<i>I cannot believe</i>

1181
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:25,125
<i>In this magical moment</i>

1182
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:56,625
<i>Nothing can stop us now</i>

1183
01:18:57,333 --> 01:19:00,333
<i>Not even hailstones</i>

1184
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:03,625
<i>This is a celebration the world never saw</i>

1185
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,208
<i>My dream came true</i>

1186
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,833
<i>It picked up pace</i>

1187
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:14,500
<i>My heart has to deal with it</i>

1188
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:17,833
<i>Like a raging wave</i>

1189
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,375
<i>My life picks up the stride</i>

1190
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:25,333
<i>This first step I took today</i>

1191
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:28,875
<i>Moves forward without asking me</i>

1192
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:32,500
<i>Youthfulness melts like snow</i>

1193
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:35,750
<i>And turns into my own story</i>

1194
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:40,750
<i>Is it real? How did this happen?</i>

1195
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:15,333
<i>My desire didn't know how to walk</i>

1196
01:20:15,417 --> 01:20:18,750
<i>But you've taught it to run, my friend</i>

1197
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:22,417
<i>This joy is unbelievable</i>

1198
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:25,750
<i>A never-ending celebration</i>

1199
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:29,250
<i>Let me show you wonders</i>

1200
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:32,750
<i>Let your dreams be fulfilled</i>
<i>Through my eyes</i>

1201
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:36,417
<i>Make a wish and I will fulfill it</i>

1202
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,708
<i>Never hide it within your heart</i>

1203
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:57,917
<i>There's no way to stop</i>

1204
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,292
<i>The happiness I'm feeling</i>

1205
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:04,917
<i>I cannot believe</i>

1206
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:08,625
<i>In this magical moment</i>

1207
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:12,125
<i>Let there be an earthquake</i>
<i>Let the earth be gone</i>

1208
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:15,500
<i>There's no way to stop this happiness</i>

1209
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:19,250
<i>No matter what, this is a lifelong joy</i>

1210
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:22,208
<i>Come, let us get it, my love</i>

1211
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,625
<i>My love!</i>

1212
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,375
Everything is set, right?

1213
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:59,250
This is a fake arranged marriage
and an intercaste marriage.

1214
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:01,417
Things can go wrong in a million ways.

1215
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:11,625
He's not here.

1216
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,333
He is in a meeting.

1217
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:16,000
Tell me what the matter is.

1218
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:20,417
Close relatives?

1219
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:23,125
I'll give you his uncle's number.
Please note it.

1220
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:24,333
Yeah. Tell me.

1221
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,458
-<i>9030...</i>
-Okay.

1222
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:30,792
I will get the alliance meeting
and engagement done right away,

1223
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:31,833
and then get married.

1224
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,333
I will keep them busy. The only thing
on their minds will be the wedding.

1225
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,000
This is not as easy as you think.

1226
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:41,708
Hey, don't worry.

1227
01:22:47,542 --> 01:22:48,625
Hey.

1228
01:22:49,417 --> 01:22:50,958
My phone rang. Who was it?

1229
01:22:51,042 --> 01:22:52,750
I didn't ask. They didn't tell.

1230
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:55,792
-Hey.
-Hmm.

1231
01:23:10,542 --> 01:23:12,083
You do funny things all the time.

1232
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:20,875
You have to help me.

1233
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:22,000
What is that?

1234
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,500
That is...

1235
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:31,083
Who is it?

1236
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:32,750
My name is Durga Prasad.

1237
01:23:32,958 --> 01:23:34,000
Are you Hari, dear?

1238
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:35,417
Yes, uncle. Tell me.

1239
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,542
I have to discuss something important
with your father.

1240
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,000
Can you give me his phone number?

1241
01:23:39,375 --> 01:23:40,625
Dad?

1242
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:42,208
He is with me.

1243
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:43,542
Talk to him.

1244
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:55,042
Tell me.

1245
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:57,000
Dad, will you be happy if I get married?

1246
01:23:58,167 --> 01:23:59,167
Yeah.

1247
01:23:59,292 --> 01:24:01,125
<i>I got a marriage proposal.</i>
<i>Tell Mom about it.</i>

1248
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:03,292
We are meeting them in Vizag tomorrow.
We have to go.

1249
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:05,917
Did you love someone or what?

1250
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,083
There is nothing like that.

1251
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,708
It seems she's a good girl,
so my senior insisted that I see her.

1252
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:11,083
Me?

1253
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:12,750
Okay, send me their details.

1254
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:15,000
Dad, my senior will take care
of everything.

1255
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,333
You just have to be ready.

1256
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:18,375
Who's that "senior"? Is he your boss?

1257
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:20,208
No! He is the boss of my boss.

1258
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:23,083
<i>Okay. We have to go tomorrow.</i>
<i>Don't forget.</i>

1259
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:24,750
Okay.

1260
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:28,958
Dear, someone brought
a marriage proposal for Hari.

1261
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:30,625
He agreed to it.

1262
01:24:30,917 --> 01:24:32,208
-Really?
-Yes.

1263
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:34,083
Janaki was right.

1264
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:37,417
We performed a ritual to break his curse,
and he agreed to get married.

1265
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,000
-I will tell Janaki.
-Okay.

1266
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:42,958
<i>Three missed calls from an unknown number.</i>

1267
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:51,208
<i>Let's give a missed call and see.</i>
<i>He will call back if necessary.</i>

1268
01:24:57,708 --> 01:25:00,833
We started in the morning.
We are going there. Yeah.

1269
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:10,833
What?

1270
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Did you explain the matter
to your parents?

1271
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:14,250
Which matter?

1272
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:16,292
The caste thing! What else?

1273
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,917
I forgot to tell them about it.

1274
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,125
-You didn't tell them?
<i>-We can tell them later.</i>

1275
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:23,958
You wouldn't have agreed
if I had told you the plan.

1276
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:25,500
Some things are to be told,
and some are to be done.

1277
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:27,542
What about faking your father's name
and hometown?

1278
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,208
-Won't you say that too?
-Let's see.

1279
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:31,417
My parents are coward types.

1280
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,208
They don't know how to handle
difficult situations.

1281
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:35,500
If I tell them that all this is an act,
they won't be able to do it.

1282
01:25:35,583 --> 01:25:37,000
Everything will be ruined.

1283
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:38,958
Yes, everything will be ruined.

1284
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:40,083
I will reject you.

1285
01:25:40,417 --> 01:25:41,333
Hey...

1286
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,667
Dad, remember one thing.

1287
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:49,083
Just smile when they ask you
about our caste, and I'll handle it.

1288
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:50,833
-And your name...
-Hello, sir. Greetings.

1289
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:52,750
Greetings.

1290
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:54,000
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

1291
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,625
Come.

1292
01:25:57,542 --> 01:25:58,625
Welcome, Mr. Srinivas.

1293
01:25:58,708 --> 01:25:59,750
It is Venkateswar, sir.

1294
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,875
Dad, watch out!

1295
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:05,000
Let's go.
Come.

1296
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,792
We were not at all prepared for it.
Everything was in a hurry.

1297
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,542
We thought he would never marry.

1298
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:14,500
His boss' boss took interest in him.

1299
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:15,542
Dad!

1300
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:17,583
He is a great support in my life.

1301
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:19,125
But let's not discuss about him.

1302
01:26:19,458 --> 01:26:20,833
Shall we see the girl?

1303
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:26,292
Come, Chinni.

1304
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:30,500
She's my daughter, Harathi.

1305
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:32,167
Come... Sit, dear.

1306
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,875
My wife is excited about the fact
that you are from her hometown.

1307
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:45,833
Really?
Are you from Tenali too?

1308
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:48,667
They're not asking about the place
you grew up in, Mr. Srinivas.

1309
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:50,958
It's about your birthplace Vuyyuru,
your father's village.

1310
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,708
Dad, I told them some lies.

1311
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:58,208
Please, don't say anything.

1312
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:02,625
Mr. Srinivas.

1313
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,083
It is Venkateswar, sir.

1314
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:06,000
Srinivas Venkateswar.

1315
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,875
Oh!

1316
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:11,000
Srinivas Venkateswar?
What kind of a name is that?

1317
01:27:11,083 --> 01:27:15,083
People are named either
Srinivas or Venkateswar.

1318
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:19,375
Thank God he wasn't named
Srinivas Venkateswar Govind Balaji!

1319
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:21,750
His address would've been Tirupati.

1320
01:27:22,583 --> 01:27:24,125
Why didn't you eat anything?

1321
01:27:24,417 --> 01:27:26,000
<i>Being nice after what you said.</i>

1322
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,500
Why are they calling your father
Srinivas instead of Venkateswar.

1323
01:27:28,583 --> 01:27:30,208
Mom, I will explain everything later.

1324
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:32,708
What is it? Does your son
want to speak with our daughter?

1325
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:35,417
No.

1326
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,333
There is nothing for me to talk, uncle.

1327
01:27:37,667 --> 01:27:40,708
If you all like me, I have no objections.

1328
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,917
You both should talk.
There might be some things to talk about.

1329
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
No, uncle.

1330
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:51,083
I mean... there is no need for that.

1331
01:27:52,292 --> 01:27:55,333
You are very shy.
I'm permitting you. Go.

1332
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Go, son.

1333
01:28:04,625 --> 01:28:05,542
I will be back.

1334
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:06,500
Hmm.

1335
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:11,083
I will reject you
if you tell any more lies.

1336
01:28:11,167 --> 01:28:12,333
I was a fool to trust you.

1337
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:14,208
You and your stupid plan!
Damn!

1338
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:16,000
You are becoming more violent.

1339
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,500
Arundhati!

1340
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:22,125
Slowly bring out Harathi.

1341
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:24,208
Come on... Come on...

1342
01:28:26,208 --> 01:28:28,292
I really forgot about my dad's name
and hometown.

1343
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,000
Let's see what we can to do now.

1344
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:32,000
Okay?

1345
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:34,375
Okay, I will go out.

1346
01:28:34,458 --> 01:28:35,875
I have no idea
what they must be talking about.

1347
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:37,208
My pencil.

1348
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:44,292
What do you think happened?

1349
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:47,500
My father liked both the sisters
during my alliance meeting.

1350
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:48,917
We were confused.

1351
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:51,458
It happened this way
because it was my fate.

1352
01:28:53,417 --> 01:28:54,708
Are you done with your talking?

1353
01:28:54,792 --> 01:28:55,708
Hmm.

1354
01:28:56,333 --> 01:28:58,083
This is what we call a fast generation.

1355
01:28:58,167 --> 01:28:59,500
Yes.

1356
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,833
-Please have some sweets.
-We must leave now.

1357
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,833
-We'll call after we make a decision.
-Okay.

1358
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:09,250
What is this?

1359
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:10,917
I hope you are not cheating anyone.

1360
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:16,750
Sorry, Dad.

1361
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:19,125
I didn't want to miss out on this girl.

1362
01:29:19,208 --> 01:29:20,833
So I acted rashly and troubled you.

1363
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:23,833
You both wanted me to get married.

1364
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,792
But I never cared about your plans.

1365
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,500
I already knew Harathi, Mom.

1366
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:32,833
But...

1367
01:29:35,167 --> 01:29:36,917
That is why I made the decision.

1368
01:29:41,083 --> 01:29:44,167
<i>With the help of that caste tree</i>
<i>I lied about Dad's name.</i>

1369
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:51,958
Everything is okay for now
because they trust us.

1370
01:29:53,292 --> 01:29:55,708
It will be fine as long as
they don't inquire about us.

1371
01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:57,250
I have no objection to the wedding.

1372
01:29:57,333 --> 01:29:58,958
There might be many issues later.

1373
01:29:59,042 --> 01:30:00,000
Mom.

1374
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:02,208
There won't be an issue
once the wedding is done.

1375
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:04,167
Everyone will be busy with their work.

1376
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:06,958
We will meet them only for festivals.
That's it.

1377
01:30:07,042 --> 01:30:09,500
Even if they find out...
Let's worry about it when it happens.

1378
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:11,208
Hmm?

1379
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:13,125
-Okay. Go ahead.
-Let's go.

1380
01:30:13,542 --> 01:30:14,542
Okay, do as you wish

1381
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:24,583
<i>Oh, it's him again.</i>

1382
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:27,042
Yeah. Tell me.

1383
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:32,042
Varun. Eat properly.

1384
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:36,333
What happened, Srinu?

1385
01:30:36,917 --> 01:30:38,000
Nothing, brother.

1386
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:42,792
Why are you leaving
without having curd?

1387
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:45,083
Nothing! Ram Mohan is here.
He is waiting for me outside.

1388
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:47,208
I'll be back in five minutes.

1389
01:30:47,292 --> 01:30:48,375
Okay.

1390
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:51,667
Sister-in-law.

1391
01:30:54,417 --> 01:30:57,250
I called up the groom's uncle
and spoke with him.

1392
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:01,500
I found something very bad.

1393
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:05,833
It's...

1394
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:07,750
How do I tell Durga?

1395
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,833
I am extremely worried.

1396
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,750
Why did you get up halfway?

1397
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:22,292
Yeah!

1398
01:31:24,708 --> 01:31:28,000
I called the groom's uncle
after they left.

1399
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:29,000
-Who is it?
-Shh.

1400
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:34,375
He said they don't belong to our caste.

1401
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,667
I wish it was a wrong number.

1402
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:42,417
How do I tell this to Durga?

1403
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:44,458
I am clueless.

1404
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,167
Their relatives live in Vizag, it seems.

1405
01:31:49,542 --> 01:31:52,750
I planned to meet them, and this happened.

1406
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:03,083
What should we do now?

1407
01:32:08,083 --> 01:32:09,125
What now?

1408
01:32:09,917 --> 01:32:12,417
Everything will be over
if your uncle talks to your dad.

1409
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:14,333
You have to stop him right now.

1410
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:15,958
How?

1411
01:32:16,042 --> 01:32:17,250
You have to stop him somehow.

1412
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:21,500
I'll do something if he tries to meet
my relatives or anything else.

1413
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,958
But you have to do this right now.

1414
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:29,000
Okay. I will manage.

1415
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:30,958
But you have to pray to Lord Ayyappa.

1416
01:32:32,167 --> 01:32:33,500
You are impossible.

1417
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,250
You don't understand.

1418
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,917
I vowed to God
that you'd perform the ritual,

1419
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,667
but you're not even praying to Him.
That's why we are facing these problems.

1420
01:32:41,458 --> 01:32:44,250
Even if I die in the meantime,
I will donate my body to you.

1421
01:32:44,542 --> 01:32:46,500
You can get the prayer done. Okay?

1422
01:32:52,917 --> 01:32:54,875
Nothing will happen, sister.
Don't worry.

1423
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,625
Everything will be fine.

1424
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:02,833
Aunt.

1425
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,083
How will you tell Dad about this?

1426
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,375
That's what I am worried about.

1427
01:33:12,458 --> 01:33:13,875
Think about this.

1428
01:33:14,208 --> 01:33:16,500
Who said that the guy was good
from the beginning?

1429
01:33:16,833 --> 01:33:17,833
You both.

1430
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,500
Who tried to convince me
even after I denied it?

1431
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:21,583
You both.

1432
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:25,333
Who will be the target of Dad's anger
if he finds out?

1433
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,208
Hubby. Come here.

1434
01:33:31,875 --> 01:33:33,750
Don't tell this to brother-in-law now.

1435
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:36,542
He will blame us.

1436
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:43,083
I will meet his relatives in Vizag.

1437
01:33:43,292 --> 01:33:44,500
Let's decide then.

1438
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:47,833
Sister-in-law, don't worry about it.

1439
01:33:48,208 --> 01:33:51,000
I'll handle this.
Let's wait for a couple of days.

1440
01:33:51,083 --> 01:33:52,250
Okay?

1441
01:33:57,417 --> 01:33:59,292
-What happened, Srinu?
-Nothing.

1442
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:03,750
-What? Caste problem?
-No. Gas problem.

1443
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:05,250
In my stomach!

1444
01:34:09,792 --> 01:34:11,667
How did they get my uncle's number?

1445
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:15,417
<i>They won't say a word to my dad.</i>

1446
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:20,667
What did you do?

1447
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:22,000
<i>Forget that.</i>

1448
01:34:22,083 --> 01:34:23,708
<i>You will do the prayer, right?</i>

1449
01:34:23,792 --> 01:34:25,417
<i>Hey! Are you crazy?</i>
<i>I will never do that.</i>

1450
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,083
<i>I have got a lot of work. Bye.</i>

1451
01:34:27,708 --> 01:34:28,667
<i>Just a minute.</i>

1452
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:32,000
<i>Uncle wants to meet your relatives.</i>
<i>What about that?</i>

1453
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:33,875
<i>I'm coming to Vizag.</i>

1454
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:35,125
<i>We have two days.</i>

1455
01:34:35,375 --> 01:34:36,500
<i>I will do something.</i>

1456
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:42,583
<i>I shouldn't do anything in a hurry.</i>

1457
01:34:42,875 --> 01:34:44,500
<i>I should do something</i>

1458
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,958
<i>that will put an end</i>
<i>to all the problems once and for all.</i>

1459
01:34:48,208 --> 01:34:50,083
<i>First I should do something</i>
<i>to stop her uncle.</i>

1460
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:02,292
Damn!

1461
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:07,417
I was going to call you.

1462
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,333
Is that why you switched off your phone?

1463
01:35:09,417 --> 01:35:11,625
No. Something very strange happened.

1464
01:35:11,708 --> 01:35:13,917
<i>Someone called me to discuss</i>
<i>a marriage proposal for you.</i>

1465
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,750
Let me tell you the funny part.

1466
01:35:16,917 --> 01:35:18,833
They are from a different caste.

1467
01:35:19,917 --> 01:35:22,417
Before inquiring anything,

1468
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:27,250
I gave them
the details of all our relatives.

1469
01:35:28,792 --> 01:35:30,292
I like that girl.

1470
01:35:33,292 --> 01:35:35,542
If they call off the wedding
because of you...

1471
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:47,667
Tell me.

1472
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:50,833
Call her uncle and cover up
your mistake.

1473
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:53,375
-How?
-Think about it.

1474
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:56,750
Say that you'd lost your mind or
it was a mistake. Just solve this problem.

1475
01:35:57,375 --> 01:35:59,250
How do I do that?

1476
01:35:59,625 --> 01:36:01,292
You have a loose tongue, right?

1477
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:05,167
Tell them that you changed your caste
for your marriage.

1478
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:06,667
<i>Say something and solve this now.</i>

1479
01:36:07,792 --> 01:36:08,875
Okay.

1480
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:15,958
Who gave my uncle's number to them?

1481
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:25,750
I will finish Babji today.

1482
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:32,208
Harathi! Babji spoiled our entire plan.

1483
01:36:32,458 --> 01:36:34,167
It's okay. Nothing will happen.

1484
01:36:34,542 --> 01:36:35,792
I will kill him!

1485
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:38,667
Forget that.
Do you know why I called you?

1486
01:36:38,958 --> 01:36:41,000
I have a special surprise for you.

1487
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:42,250
What gift?

1488
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:43,875
Did you get me God's offerings?

1489
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:47,292
No! You asked for a kiss, didn't you?

1490
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:49,500
What? A kiss?

1491
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:51,083
Yeah. Come home.

1492
01:36:51,792 --> 01:36:52,958
-Your home?
-Yes.

1493
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,125
Come home if you really want the kiss.

1494
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:57,625
<i>Finding Babji isn't that important.</i>

1495
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:00,500
What about your parents?

1496
01:37:01,292 --> 01:37:04,125
A coward doesn't deserve a kiss.
Can't you show some courage?

1497
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:07,000
Okay. Your wish.
You'll have a good time if you come.

1498
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:10,167
<i>A few moments later.</i>

1499
01:37:11,667 --> 01:37:12,833
Go quietly.

1500
01:37:23,333 --> 01:37:24,500
Right here, dear.

1501
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:33,958
I was waiting for you.

1502
01:37:35,375 --> 01:37:36,500
Come.

1503
01:37:38,542 --> 01:37:40,083
She said that you'll come.

1504
01:37:40,417 --> 01:37:42,417
She told me
that you are a strong believer.

1505
01:37:45,167 --> 01:37:47,125
They are praying right here. Come.

1506
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:05,500
<i>...with the financial help...</i>

1507
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:12,375
Hail Lord Ayyappa!

1508
01:38:19,958 --> 01:38:22,250
<i>Hail Lord!</i>

1509
01:38:23,583 --> 01:38:28,208
<i>Hail Lord Ayyappa! Praise Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1510
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:47,083
<i>Don't look so upset</i>

1511
01:38:47,542 --> 01:38:51,833
<i>Your curse will be gone now</i>

1512
01:38:52,292 --> 01:38:56,625
<i>It followed you</i>
<i>Even though you tried to escape</i>

1513
01:38:56,958 --> 01:39:01,375
<i>There's nothing wrong</i>
<i>In pleasing the Lord for me</i>

1514
01:39:01,792 --> 01:39:06,667
<i>Hail Lord Ayyappa! Praise Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1515
01:39:20,917 --> 01:39:23,083
<i>Don't question me with your eyes</i>

1516
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:25,375
<i>Don't give me that doubtful stare</i>

1517
01:39:25,875 --> 01:39:27,750
<i>This is just for a moment</i>

1518
01:39:28,083 --> 01:39:30,292
<i>Why don't you accept it?</i>

1519
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:35,000
<i>There wouldn't have been an issue</i>
<i>If you had just said yes</i>

1520
01:39:35,458 --> 01:39:37,542
<i>I wanted to see you like this</i>

1521
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:39,917
<i>My desire is fulfilled</i>

1522
01:39:40,333 --> 01:39:42,667
<i>Anointing of clarified butter to the Lord</i>

1523
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:45,083
<i>Food offering to the Lord</i>

1524
01:39:45,167 --> 01:39:47,458
<i>Blessed food for the Lord</i>

1525
01:39:47,542 --> 01:39:49,792
<i>Sandalwood and saffron for the Lord</i>

1526
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:04,083
<i>You should stop being so stubborn</i>

1527
01:40:04,333 --> 01:40:08,667
<i>You came here with some expectations</i>

1528
01:40:09,167 --> 01:40:13,500
<i>My magic has brought you till here</i>

1529
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:18,333
<i>Don't worry, just pray to Lord Ayyappa</i>

1530
01:40:18,708 --> 01:40:23,458
<i>Hail Lord Ayyappa! Praise Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1531
01:40:37,125 --> 01:40:41,208
<i>Don't look so upset</i>

1532
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:45,458
<i>Your curse will be gone now</i>

1533
01:40:45,792 --> 01:40:49,667
<i>It followed you</i>
<i>Even though you tried to escape</i>

1534
01:40:49,958 --> 01:40:54,000
<i>There's nothing wrong</i>
<i>In pleasing the Lord for me</i>

1535
01:40:54,417 --> 01:40:56,500
<i>Anointing of clarified butter to the Lord</i>

1536
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:58,625
<i>Food offering to the Lord</i>

1537
01:40:58,708 --> 01:41:00,750
<i>Blessed food for the Lord</i>

1538
01:41:00,833 --> 01:41:02,792
<i>Sandalwood and saffron for the Lord</i>

1539
01:41:02,875 --> 01:41:04,833
-<i>Between you and me</i>
<i>-Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1540
01:41:04,917 --> 01:41:07,042
<i>-Is a tiny war</i>
<i>-Praise Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1541
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:09,208
<i>-Don't be mad at me</i>
<i>-Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1542
01:41:09,292 --> 01:41:11,333
<i>-Learn to praise God</i>
<i>-Praise Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1543
01:41:11,417 --> 01:41:13,500
<i>-Like a Mickey Mouse game</i>
<i>-Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1544
01:41:13,583 --> 01:41:15,542
<i>-It is cute to see</i>
<i>-Praise Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1545
01:41:15,625 --> 01:41:17,542
<i>-Look, what a wonder it is</i>
<i>-Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1546
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:19,792
<i>-Your face is changing</i>
<i>-Praise Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1547
01:41:19,875 --> 01:41:24,083
<i>Hail Lord Ayyappa! Praise Lord Ayyappa!</i>

1548
01:41:30,208 --> 01:41:33,125
Hail Lord Ayyappa!

1549
01:41:35,667 --> 01:41:36,750
Dear.

1550
01:41:36,875 --> 01:41:38,542
I am looking matches for my daughter.

1551
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:40,625
I heard that you created a mobile app.

1552
01:41:41,583 --> 01:41:44,875
I will find a match for her
if you give me that app.

1553
01:41:44,958 --> 01:41:47,292
Sir, in these modern times...

1554
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:49,875
Why don't you make one?

1555
01:41:50,167 --> 01:41:51,500
It was just a slip of the tongue.

1556
01:41:51,583 --> 01:41:53,417
I don't know how to do it. I can't.

1557
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,333
Your father-in-law told me
that you are creating an app.

1558
01:41:57,417 --> 01:41:59,083
He mentioned it? I will do it.

1559
01:42:02,833 --> 01:42:03,958
-One minute.
-Okay.

1560
01:42:04,042 --> 01:42:05,250
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Mr. Srinu...

1561
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:06,667
I have to tell you something.

1562
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:09,625
I am calling you
because it is about a wedding.

1563
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,667
Hari and our family have some clashes.

1564
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:13,833
That is why I said
he belonged to a different caste.

1565
01:42:13,917 --> 01:42:17,167
<i>Mine is an intercaste marriage.</i>
<i>I loved someone and got married to her.</i>

1566
01:42:17,333 --> 01:42:18,708
<i>They go crazy</i>
<i>when it comes to caste.</i>

1567
01:42:18,792 --> 01:42:21,000
That is why I stopped talking to them.

1568
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:21,917
That's the matter.

1569
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,708
This is Govardhan. See you.

1570
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:32,250
-Tell me when the app is ready.
-Sure, sir.

1571
01:42:32,333 --> 01:42:33,833
-Praise Lord Ayyappa!
-Praise Lord Ayyappa.

1572
01:42:39,958 --> 01:42:40,958
Tell me, Mr. Prasad.

1573
01:42:41,042 --> 01:42:43,083
We like your son very much.

1574
01:42:43,833 --> 01:42:46,375
We will go ahead with the engagement
if you're okay with it.

1575
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:52,708
Hey, Anil.

1576
01:42:52,792 --> 01:42:54,250
Find a software guy,

1577
01:42:54,333 --> 01:42:56,708
and bring him immediately to Vizag. Hmm?

1578
01:43:11,208 --> 01:43:12,875
-Keerthi! Actually...
-Won't you change?

1579
01:43:16,458 --> 01:43:17,292
Come.

1580
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:18,750
I will come back.

1581
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:20,500
Do you have snacks?

1582
01:43:20,833 --> 01:43:22,000
Hey! Damn you!

1583
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:23,792
Hey! Idiot!

1584
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:28,625
Have you lost it?
Do you realize what you did?

1585
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:32,958
<i>This is a good idea.</i>

1586
01:43:37,292 --> 01:43:38,250
Done.

1587
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:40,083
Thanks.

1588
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:56,375
<i>So, he stole my chart.</i>

1589
01:44:13,458 --> 01:44:16,375
-Why don't you kiss me now?
-Hey! Are you crazy?

1590
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:22,208
Why do you always bother me
about the kiss?

1591
01:44:39,083 --> 01:44:40,958
Dear, what's your caste?

1592
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:42,583
We are from drunkards' caste.

1593
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:53,250
Why didn't Hari come?
Is he busy with office work?

1594
01:44:53,917 --> 01:44:57,000
No office work. He lost his job.

1595
01:44:57,833 --> 01:45:00,042
Lost his job? When?

1596
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:03,250
Won't he lose his job
if he stays here for two months?

1597
01:45:04,292 --> 01:45:05,500
What do you mean he stays here?

1598
01:45:06,917 --> 01:45:10,000
Yeah. He's been staying in a hotel here
ever since his curse was lifted.

1599
01:45:10,083 --> 01:45:11,500
Hey! Stop it.

1600
01:45:12,083 --> 01:45:13,417
What you mean he stays in a hotel?

1601
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,042
Where else should we stay?
In your home?

1602
01:45:16,125 --> 01:45:17,958
We have a lot to do.

1603
01:45:20,375 --> 01:45:23,833
-Are you all staying here?
-No. Some are traveling to and fro.

1604
01:45:24,292 --> 01:45:25,750
What kind of question is that?

1605
01:45:26,375 --> 01:45:27,833
We have to take care of many things.

1606
01:45:28,792 --> 01:45:30,292
Harathi also...

1607
01:45:45,292 --> 01:45:47,833
He isn't coming to the office.
It looks like he lost his job.

1608
01:45:54,292 --> 01:45:57,000
They smoke, booze,
and bring girls to the room.

1609
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:05,250
-Fill it up with soil.
-Okay, sir.

1610
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:07,417
Finish it by tomorrow evening.
Do you understand?

1611
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,292
-Yes, sir.
-Go.

1612
01:46:10,875 --> 01:46:12,250
Srinu, you wanted to say something?

1613
01:46:13,042 --> 01:46:17,375
I don't know why but Hari and his friends
are staying in a hotel here in Vizag.

1614
01:46:18,125 --> 01:46:19,375
He lost his job.

1615
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:23,542
They booze and smoke every day.

1616
01:46:24,042 --> 01:46:26,417
A man from the hotel told me
that girls come to visit them.

1617
01:46:28,625 --> 01:46:29,958
And, Durga,

1618
01:46:30,375 --> 01:46:32,042
I hid something from you.

1619
01:46:33,583 --> 01:46:35,958
The groom's uncle
had an intercaste marriage.

1620
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:40,667
It will tarnish our reputation
if everyone finds out.

1621
01:46:40,917 --> 01:46:43,750
We've distributed the cards.
We've invited everyone.

1622
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:47,750
These are all rumors.

1623
01:46:49,625 --> 01:46:51,542
I will not spare anyone who cheats me.

1624
01:46:53,625 --> 01:46:56,958
I don't care even if the cards are out.
I don't care even if everything is booked.

1625
01:46:59,625 --> 01:47:02,750
I will call everyone and tell them
that the wedding has been called off.

1626
01:47:05,083 --> 01:47:07,625
I will call off the wedding
on the spot if need be.

1627
01:47:10,417 --> 01:47:12,583
Ask him to meet me.
Let's talk to him directly.

1628
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:13,625
Okay.

1629
01:47:14,125 --> 01:47:16,167
This is what happens
when you act rashly.

1630
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:18,417
You said we've nothing to lose.

1631
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,750
See what happened now.

1632
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,375
There are no solutions
for some problems. That's it.

1633
01:47:34,625 --> 01:47:35,500
Yes.

1634
01:47:35,833 --> 01:47:37,375
Durga wants to meet you.

1635
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:40,375
Okay, I will come tomorrow.

1636
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:45,375
<i>There's no other way now.</i>
<i>I have to give him the shock.</i>

1637
01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:49,083
This is just an accident.

1638
01:47:50,208 --> 01:47:52,500
Our main scam shouldn't get exposed
because of this.

1639
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:54,333
There won't be any problem until then.

1640
01:47:56,083 --> 01:47:57,458
I want you, Harathi.

1641
01:47:57,875 --> 01:48:01,375
I really don't care about caste,
society or your fears.

1642
01:48:02,458 --> 01:48:05,708
All I know is that your father
is standing the way of our happiness.

1643
01:48:06,333 --> 01:48:07,833
Let's see what his problem is.

1644
01:48:08,958 --> 01:48:11,833
I will come to your house tomorrow.
Meanwhile, you have to do something.

1645
01:48:12,208 --> 01:48:13,958
Tell your mom about this app.

1646
01:48:14,458 --> 01:48:15,833
Then I will come and talk.

1647
01:48:16,208 --> 01:48:17,208
Hmm.

1648
01:48:17,833 --> 01:48:19,667
Your dad will definitely understand.

1649
01:48:42,083 --> 01:48:43,875
It looks like you are busy today.

1650
01:48:43,958 --> 01:48:45,458
Tell me your grandfather's name.

1651
01:48:47,292 --> 01:48:48,708
My grandfather's name is Ramaiah.

1652
01:48:49,583 --> 01:48:52,083
My dad's name is Satyanarayana
and my name is Durga Prasad.

1653
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:27,417
Hubby, get up.

1654
01:49:29,083 --> 01:49:30,958
I looked up your family history.

1655
01:49:31,333 --> 01:49:35,208
Your grandfather didn't have kids,
so he adopted a child.

1656
01:49:36,583 --> 01:49:39,833
Why should we care if Grandfather
had adopted someone?

1657
01:49:45,083 --> 01:49:46,417
He didn't have kids?

1658
01:49:59,583 --> 01:50:01,167
<i>How do we feel</i>

1659
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:05,458
<i>when we suddenly find out that everything</i>
<i>we value isn't ours anymore?</i>

1660
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,708
<i>The fact that he wasn't actually born</i>
<i>in his family or into his caste</i>

1661
01:50:10,333 --> 01:50:14,417
<i>was as shocking to him as someone</i>
<i>finding out that he is impotent.</i>

1662
01:50:17,583 --> 01:50:19,333
Do you think this is true?

1663
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:24,958
That is why your hair is brown
unlike everyone else in our community.

1664
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:28,833
Is this what you thought all night?

1665
01:50:29,917 --> 01:50:31,583
Did you list out all my loopholes?

1666
01:50:34,083 --> 01:50:35,958
-Will you leave me or what?
-Oh, no!

1667
01:50:37,333 --> 01:50:38,458
Stop crying.

1668
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:41,708
And don't tell this to anyone.

1669
01:50:43,208 --> 01:50:44,458
Do you understand?

1670
01:50:46,833 --> 01:50:48,833
Stop making that face as if I died.

1671
01:51:00,583 --> 01:51:04,667
<i>It is a wonder that a big mountain</i>
<i>Looks small in a mirror</i>

1672
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:07,875
<i>Which eventually become a saying</i>

1673
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:10,458
<i>In the words of Viswadabirama</i>

1674
01:51:10,542 --> 01:51:11,958
<i>What is my situation now?</i>

1675
01:51:12,333 --> 01:51:15,792
<i>The good-looking fruit is all alone</i>

1676
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,333
<i>Oh, no! Oh, no, no!</i>

1677
01:51:19,583 --> 01:51:22,833
<i>The lion has turned into a cat</i>

1678
01:51:23,458 --> 01:51:26,083
I have take out my car.
Can you move aside?

1679
01:51:26,833 --> 01:51:29,917
<i>Oh, no! Oh, no, no!</i>

1680
01:51:30,583 --> 01:51:32,833
<i>The hard times are unpleasant</i>

1681
01:51:33,458 --> 01:51:36,333
<i>What if my wife regrets marrying me?</i>

1682
01:51:39,833 --> 01:51:41,458
Do you think I have some disease?

1683
01:51:42,083 --> 01:51:44,000
Why are you staring at me? Go!

1684
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:56,875
<i>What if people in our community</i>
<i>and close friends find out?</i>

1685
01:51:58,708 --> 01:52:00,583
<i>I thought they were like my family.</i>

1686
01:52:01,417 --> 01:52:03,083
<i>We leave this world alone at the end.</i>

1687
01:52:03,417 --> 01:52:05,958
<i>All this is just an illusion.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

1688
01:52:06,083 --> 01:52:08,083
He said he'd come in the morning
but didn't come yet.

1689
01:52:08,958 --> 01:52:10,833
<i>Oh! Is that why he came here?</i>

1690
01:52:11,208 --> 01:52:14,208
<i>Since he skipped office to be here,</i>
<i>I was scared he'd found out about me.</i>

1691
01:52:18,583 --> 01:52:20,333
-Hello, uncle.
-Have a seat.

1692
01:52:21,208 --> 01:52:22,208
You wanted to see me?

1693
01:52:22,917 --> 01:52:24,458
We know about your job.

1694
01:52:25,958 --> 01:52:28,250
Uncle, I have to tell you something.

1695
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:32,208
Do you think we don't know
about your boozing and having girls over?

1696
01:52:33,292 --> 01:52:35,833
We thought that you're a good person
and have a good job.

1697
01:52:35,917 --> 01:52:37,917
You thought we wouldn't do anything
since we already distributed the cards?

1698
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,833
We'll call off the wedding
if you talk too much.

1699
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,083
You can do that if you think it's right.

1700
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:47,833
But I didn't lose my job.
I just took a break.

1701
01:52:48,083 --> 01:52:49,833
You can talk to my boss if you want.

1702
01:52:49,917 --> 01:52:52,250
And only one girl came to that hotel.

1703
01:52:52,583 --> 01:52:55,333
She is my friend's would-be wife.
She came to pick him up. That's it.

1704
01:52:55,708 --> 01:52:57,958
And the thing about me drinking...
It isn't true.

1705
01:52:58,833 --> 01:53:00,708
Oh, no! Forget about it, Hari.

1706
01:53:00,833 --> 01:53:03,583
-That was just a misunderstanding.
-What is this, brother?

1707
01:53:04,333 --> 01:53:06,083
Did you forget about
his uncle's intercaste marriage?

1708
01:53:06,583 --> 01:53:09,083
I hate that such people
are present in our caste.

1709
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,458
Do you think you're a big hero
because you created an app?

1710
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:14,583
Stop talking about that app...

1711
01:53:20,583 --> 01:53:22,208
Never bring up these matters before me.

1712
01:53:24,333 --> 01:53:25,958
Why do you always worry about our caste?

1713
01:53:31,208 --> 01:53:32,833
-Hari.
-Uncle.

1714
01:53:33,208 --> 01:53:35,708
Let's forget about these issues
and make arrangements for the wedding.

1715
01:53:38,708 --> 01:53:40,208
<i>He felt bad I guess.</i>

1716
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:41,833
I will take your leave now.

1717
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,458
Come in. Let's have lunch together.

1718
01:53:43,667 --> 01:53:45,375
-It's lunchtime.
-It's okay.

1719
01:53:45,458 --> 01:53:47,958
-I have some work. I will come later.
-Okay, then.

1720
01:53:48,125 --> 01:53:49,208
Okay. See you.

1721
01:54:05,833 --> 01:54:08,458
<i>Did I misunderstand Dad all along?</i>

1722
01:54:09,208 --> 01:54:10,708
<i>Did I hear it right?</i>

1723
01:54:12,333 --> 01:54:15,958
<i>I don't know what you did,</i>
<i>but Dad has really changed.</i>

1724
01:54:19,958 --> 01:54:21,750
<i>You are happy, aren't you? Enjoy!</i>

1725
01:54:22,958 --> 01:54:26,458
<i>I dominated him all these days.</i>
<i>What if he finds out the truth?</i>

1726
01:54:27,333 --> 01:54:28,417
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1727
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,583
<i>I have to treat him well.</i>

1728
01:54:33,458 --> 01:54:34,833
That's not true, Srinu.

1729
01:54:35,333 --> 01:54:38,583
<i>It is a wonder! Yes, It is a wonder!</i>

1730
01:54:38,958 --> 01:54:42,000
<i>Yet, it is believable</i>

1731
01:54:42,458 --> 01:54:49,125
<i>How can anyone be so innocent?</i>

1732
01:54:50,375 --> 01:54:51,375
Dad.

1733
01:54:51,958 --> 01:54:52,958
Here's your tea.

1734
01:54:53,708 --> 01:54:57,000
<i>Will he believe that too?</i>

1735
01:54:58,208 --> 01:54:59,125
Dad.

1736
01:54:59,292 --> 01:55:03,708
<i>If you say bronze is gold</i>

1737
01:55:04,833 --> 01:55:08,083
<i>Oh, no! Oh, no, no!</i>

1738
01:55:08,458 --> 01:55:12,167
<i>The lion has turned into a cat</i>

1739
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:13,625
<i>Oh, no! Oh, no, no!</i>

1740
01:55:13,917 --> 01:55:15,458
<i>What if people find out?</i>

1741
01:55:15,958 --> 01:55:18,250
<i>Oh, no! We should get them married</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

1742
01:55:18,833 --> 01:55:20,333
<i>The guy is particular about caste.</i>

1743
01:55:20,625 --> 01:55:22,458
<i>He created an app for it.</i>

1744
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,583
<i>My husband has become quiet.</i>

1745
01:55:25,083 --> 01:55:28,083
<i>I can't share my problems with anyone.</i>
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

1746
01:55:35,458 --> 01:55:37,583
Don't tell this to anyone, Sita.

1747
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:44,333
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1748
01:55:45,833 --> 01:55:46,708
<i>Really?</i>

1749
01:55:46,875 --> 01:55:48,458
<i>But this is not Durga's fault.</i>

1750
01:55:48,958 --> 01:55:50,708
Deep down, he's suffering.

1751
01:55:51,292 --> 01:55:54,458
<i>He might looks harsh on the outside,</i>
<i>but he is very sensitive.</i>

1752
01:55:54,708 --> 01:55:58,708
<i>It is a wonder that a big mountain</i>
<i>Looks small in a mirror</i>

1753
01:55:58,958 --> 01:56:02,000
<i>Which eventually become a saying</i>

1754
01:56:02,083 --> 01:56:04,125
<i>In the words of Viswadabirama</i>

1755
01:56:04,208 --> 01:56:06,083
<i>You can't marry Neelakantam's daughter.</i>

1756
01:56:08,292 --> 01:56:09,708
<i>Even in this generation?</i>

1757
01:56:10,208 --> 01:56:12,583
<i>Will you still follow old ways, father?</i>

1758
01:56:13,125 --> 01:56:15,000
They have been saying that
since the olden days.

1759
01:56:15,333 --> 01:56:16,333
What happened?

1760
01:56:16,667 --> 01:56:18,583
Everyone is the same even now.

1761
01:56:19,542 --> 01:56:22,417
How many families are allowing
intercaste marriages?

1762
01:56:23,208 --> 01:56:25,833
My brother's daughter is marrying
a guy from another caste.

1763
01:56:26,958 --> 01:56:28,708
I don't know what to do.

1764
01:56:30,583 --> 01:56:32,083
Caste doesn't matter...

1765
01:56:34,417 --> 01:56:36,542
I will accept it if my daughter
loves a man from another caste.

1766
01:56:37,083 --> 01:56:39,375
I just need a son-in-law
to do my last rites.

1767
01:56:39,458 --> 01:56:40,583
It can be anyone.

1768
01:56:42,708 --> 01:56:45,333
Hey, I want to see my sister.

1769
01:56:47,333 --> 01:56:48,583
Will you come with me?

1770
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:51,708
What are you thinking? Let's go.

1771
01:56:54,208 --> 01:56:55,292
What happened?

1772
01:56:55,375 --> 01:56:58,708
I ignored them all these years.

1773
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:00,958
Durga Prasad?

1774
01:57:05,208 --> 01:57:06,167
Forgive me, brother-in-law.

1775
01:57:07,458 --> 01:57:09,208
Come. Come on in. Come.

1776
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:12,083
How is it going? Is everyone doing well?

1777
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:24,917
Chinni?

1778
01:57:26,958 --> 01:57:28,000
My brother!

1779
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:30,458
Eat.

1780
01:57:31,792 --> 01:57:33,000
What is this? I can eat on my own.

1781
01:57:33,083 --> 01:57:34,708
Wait! Let me feed you.

1782
01:57:35,708 --> 01:57:42,458
<i>How can anyone be so innocent?</i>

1783
01:57:43,208 --> 01:57:48,917
<i>If you say salt is camphor</i>
<i>Will he believe that too?</i>

1784
01:57:49,125 --> 01:57:50,000
Yeah.

1785
01:57:50,083 --> 01:57:53,583
I don't want to marry you
by lying to Dad.

1786
01:57:53,917 --> 01:57:55,333
Let's tell him the truth.

1787
01:57:55,625 --> 01:57:58,333
I think you are getting emotional.
Don't do anything like that.

1788
01:57:58,417 --> 01:58:01,083
Wait until we get married.
After that, you can do anything.

1789
01:58:02,042 --> 01:58:02,958
Hmm.

1790
01:58:04,458 --> 01:58:05,750
<i>Look properly.</i>
<i>Why can't you find it?</i>

1791
01:58:05,833 --> 01:58:08,625
Mom, I can't find coriander.
What should I do?

1792
01:58:09,167 --> 01:58:11,750
-I've been looking for it for two hours.
<i>-You can't do a small thing.</i>

1793
01:58:11,833 --> 01:58:14,417
-What should I do if I can't find it?
-I heard you are getting married.

1794
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:17,583
-Who told you?
-Will you get married without telling us?

1795
01:58:18,625 --> 01:58:20,333
I was just kidding.

1796
01:58:21,083 --> 01:58:22,292
Don't mind.

1797
01:58:22,375 --> 01:58:24,167
I will come to the wedding.
Send me the card.

1798
01:58:24,875 --> 01:58:25,708
Yeah.

1799
01:58:26,958 --> 01:58:31,250
<i>It's like jumping into a well</i>
<i>Even if you don't know how to swim</i>

1800
01:58:31,708 --> 01:58:33,917
Mom, call everyone.
I need to talk to them.

1801
01:58:34,583 --> 01:58:39,083
<i>Making a plan without hurting others</i>

1802
01:58:39,708 --> 01:58:41,458
Don't invite everyone in town
to the wedding.

1803
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:43,583
Invite only close friends.

1804
01:58:44,625 --> 01:58:47,333
Be careful at the wedding
and try to avoid the caste topic.

1805
01:58:47,542 --> 01:58:50,208
If anyone asks too many questions,
carefully dodge them.

1806
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:52,958
Don't make any mistake.

1807
01:58:55,958 --> 01:58:56,958
Uncle.

1808
01:58:57,583 --> 01:58:59,500
I won't mind
if you don't come to the wedding.

1809
01:59:00,292 --> 01:59:02,583
But if something happens again...

1810
01:59:14,083 --> 01:59:15,583
<i>The wedding is two days away.</i>

1811
01:59:16,625 --> 01:59:18,208
<i>Relatives are coming in.</i>

1812
01:59:19,208 --> 01:59:23,083
<i>I'm scared how they will react</i>
<i>if they know the truth.</i>

1813
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:26,583
<i>I am not a coward</i>
<i>who would commit suicide.</i>

1814
01:59:27,917 --> 01:59:30,208
<i>I should control this agony</i>
<i>until the wedding.</i>

1815
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:33,750
<i>After that I will go away from everyone.</i>

1816
01:59:34,583 --> 01:59:36,583
The card looks beautiful
because of this border.

1817
01:59:36,667 --> 01:59:38,708
Harathi selected it, not me.

1818
01:59:38,917 --> 01:59:39,792
Hey!

1819
01:59:44,083 --> 01:59:46,458
You ruined my life, buddy.

1820
01:59:49,417 --> 01:59:51,458
I can't explain it to you. It's...

1821
01:59:52,875 --> 01:59:53,833
It was about the girl I love.

1822
01:59:53,917 --> 01:59:55,708
There was a serious problem,
so I did that.

1823
01:59:55,792 --> 01:59:58,333
Once my wedding is done,
I will tell everyone that it's your app.

1824
01:59:58,417 --> 02:00:01,458
I don't care about that anymore,
there is something else.

1825
02:00:02,083 --> 02:00:04,083
I recently got engaged.

1826
02:00:04,667 --> 02:00:07,958
The app you created shows
that the girl is like a sister to me.

1827
02:00:09,583 --> 02:00:12,083
Please do something.
Otherwise, my wedding will be called off.

1828
02:00:12,167 --> 02:00:14,083
Help me. Please tell him, sir.

1829
02:00:14,375 --> 02:00:16,333
Why do you believe this nonsense?

1830
02:00:16,833 --> 02:00:19,333
Listen carefully.
I'll tell you a dangerous secret.

1831
02:00:19,833 --> 02:00:23,000
I spilled beer on your caste tree chart.

1832
02:00:23,458 --> 02:00:25,458
I connected those links haphazardly.

1833
02:00:25,625 --> 02:00:27,958
So these are all wrong connections.

1834
02:00:28,583 --> 02:00:31,208
Don't worry.
She is the perfect match for you.

1835
02:00:32,458 --> 02:00:34,125
-Is it true?
-Yes.

1836
02:00:35,958 --> 02:00:37,083
You are really brilliant.

1837
02:00:37,792 --> 02:00:40,542
You saved my wedding...
No... You saved my life.

1838
02:00:40,625 --> 02:00:41,708
No, I didn't.

1839
02:00:41,958 --> 02:00:43,833
Actually, you got into this problem
because of me.

1840
02:00:43,958 --> 02:00:46,208
I had to trick everyone
because my caste is different.

1841
02:00:46,417 --> 02:00:47,458
Oh? Really?

1842
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:54,333
Don't tell this to anyone
until my wedding is done.

1843
02:00:54,875 --> 02:00:57,333
As I already told you
that this is a dangerous secret.

1844
02:00:57,417 --> 02:00:59,375
It's dangerous for me
and a secret for you.

1845
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:01,708
I won't tell anyone...

1846
02:01:01,958 --> 02:01:04,458
You don't know how important
this wedding is to me.

1847
02:01:04,542 --> 02:01:07,708
Sruthi and I made many plans
after our marriage was fixed.

1848
02:01:07,875 --> 02:01:09,583
Both of us got very close.

1849
02:01:09,792 --> 02:01:13,333
That is when your app came out.
She got so upset after looking at it

1850
02:01:13,833 --> 02:01:15,083
that she attempted suicide.

1851
02:01:15,708 --> 02:01:18,083
I have been sick with worry since then.

1852
02:01:18,458 --> 02:01:21,917
She will be very happy now.

1853
02:01:29,583 --> 02:01:32,333
Thank goodness!
I thought there would be a brawl.

1854
02:01:34,833 --> 02:01:39,583
Someone's life was in danger
because of me.

1855
02:01:43,708 --> 02:01:47,417
<i>I must've troubled many people</i>
<i>with my actions.</i>

1856
02:02:02,583 --> 02:02:04,958
Sruthi! There is no problem
with our wedding.

1857
02:02:06,583 --> 02:02:07,958
Don't tell this to anyone.

1858
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,583
-Really?
-We can happily get married.

1859
02:02:20,083 --> 02:02:22,792
The person who created that app
told this to your son.

1860
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:25,333
He doesn't even belong to our caste.

1861
02:02:25,458 --> 02:02:26,750
He is not from our caste?

1862
02:02:26,833 --> 02:02:29,208
We can continue
with the wedding arrangements.

1863
02:02:29,875 --> 02:02:32,333
<i>How can an outsider</i>
<i>play games with my caste?</i>

1864
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,917
<i>Don't tell this to anyone. See you.</i>

1865
02:02:40,667 --> 02:02:43,708
I am sorry, Keerthi.
I realize it now.

1866
02:02:47,542 --> 02:02:49,833
I hurt you with my behavior.

1867
02:02:55,083 --> 02:02:56,708
Greetings! Please come.

1868
02:03:00,417 --> 02:03:01,583
Yeah, I will get it.

1869
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:05,083
-Hari's uncle?
-Harathi's uncle?

1870
02:03:06,542 --> 02:03:08,292
<i>I should slowly slide away.</i>

1871
02:03:09,417 --> 02:03:12,208
See you...

1872
02:03:13,583 --> 02:03:15,333
This way. You should go this way.

1873
02:03:18,458 --> 02:03:21,000
Harathi.
I will tell the truth to your dad.

1874
02:03:21,083 --> 02:03:22,333
What?

1875
02:03:23,625 --> 02:03:24,833
Nothing.

1876
02:03:33,125 --> 02:03:35,917
<i>He's the one I've troubled the most.</i>

1877
02:03:36,667 --> 02:03:39,958
<i>I can't hide the truth from him anymore.</i>

1878
02:03:49,083 --> 02:03:50,583
My name is Adinarayana.

1879
02:03:51,208 --> 02:03:53,208
-I have to tell you something.
-Tell me.

1880
02:03:53,792 --> 02:03:56,000
It is very important.
Let's go out and talk.

1881
02:04:05,042 --> 02:04:08,667
He is not from our caste.
He is a fraud.

1882
02:04:10,208 --> 02:04:11,333
Yes.

1883
02:04:11,583 --> 02:04:14,292
That app is fraud.
Everything in that app is a lie.

1884
02:04:14,833 --> 02:04:17,917
My son made that app.
It's true, sir.

1885
02:04:20,792 --> 02:04:24,083
So it means that your father
was not an orphan.

1886
02:04:35,708 --> 02:04:37,083
What is it? What happened?

1887
02:04:49,833 --> 02:04:50,833
Who are you?

1888
02:04:51,792 --> 02:04:53,208
What is your caste?

1889
02:04:58,458 --> 02:05:01,125
You wanted to marry my daughter
by playing tricks?

1890
02:05:02,417 --> 02:05:04,208
Why did you do all this?

1891
02:05:08,083 --> 02:05:09,708
Just one phone call!

1892
02:05:10,708 --> 02:05:12,708
You'll be behind bars for fraud.

1893
02:05:14,583 --> 02:05:15,958
Your life ends here.

1894
02:05:17,833 --> 02:05:20,833
You tried to mess with me
even after knowing about me?

1895
02:05:23,708 --> 02:05:25,292
You fool.

1896
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:31,583
You tried to cheat me.

1897
02:05:33,083 --> 02:05:34,583
What kind of elderly ones are you?

1898
02:05:36,792 --> 02:05:39,167
You should have stopped your son
from doing something wrong.

1899
02:05:39,583 --> 02:05:41,208
Instead you are supporting him in it.

1900
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:43,083
Are you his real parents?

1901
02:05:43,875 --> 02:05:45,000
Are you fake too?

1902
02:05:58,625 --> 02:06:00,833
Everyone behaved blindly.

1903
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:05,917
Why? Shouldn't you verify your facts
before giving a suggestion?

1904
02:06:10,958 --> 02:06:13,458
Sister! Uncle is shouting at everyone.

1905
02:06:18,083 --> 02:06:22,458
You worry about everything
and irritate me!

1906
02:06:22,625 --> 02:06:24,458
You should know what's happening around.

1907
02:06:27,833 --> 02:06:30,375
When an outsider comes
and cheats people of my caste,

1908
02:06:30,458 --> 02:06:32,333
how do you expect me to be calm?

1909
02:06:36,542 --> 02:06:37,958
I will show you who I am.

1910
02:06:38,583 --> 02:06:40,208
This is not a small issue.

1911
02:06:40,542 --> 02:06:42,208
Everyone will get arrested!

1912
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,833
No one will ever try to mess
with my caste.

1913
02:06:48,083 --> 02:06:50,333
Your father's caste
was shown different in that app.

1914
02:06:50,417 --> 02:06:52,333
That's why he acted differently
all these days.

1915
02:06:56,875 --> 02:06:58,083
Are you the only one?

1916
02:06:58,250 --> 02:06:59,917
Or is everyone from
your caste the same?

1917
02:07:01,583 --> 02:07:04,333
You should have some sense.

1918
02:07:04,958 --> 02:07:07,208
You do not have that wisdom.
But I do.

1919
02:07:07,625 --> 02:07:09,083
I won't let this marriage happen.

1920
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:11,375
Dad, I have to talk to you.

1921
02:07:11,458 --> 02:07:12,458
Go!

1922
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:15,208
Dad, I have to talk to you.

1923
02:07:20,708 --> 02:07:22,208
Everyone will get arrested.

1924
02:07:30,625 --> 02:07:31,625
Dad!

1925
02:07:32,083 --> 02:07:33,458
I am in love with someone.

1926
02:07:34,875 --> 02:07:38,583
Only that guy and I know about it.

1927
02:07:41,083 --> 02:07:44,375
Mr. Srinu. Harathi must be worried.

1928
02:07:44,542 --> 02:07:45,583
Would you check on her?

1929
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:53,083
I have always loved and respected you.

1930
02:07:53,875 --> 02:07:55,125
You are my father after all.

1931
02:07:55,875 --> 02:07:58,583
I felt you were wrong at times.

1932
02:07:59,125 --> 02:08:01,583
But I used to convince myself

1933
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:05,458
that you are a good person, but you
placed rules and restrictions.

1934
02:08:06,667 --> 02:08:08,458
I understood something as I grew up.

1935
02:08:09,167 --> 02:08:11,083
That you found security in your caste.

1936
02:08:12,375 --> 02:08:15,208
Recently, you hated caste system.

1937
02:08:16,125 --> 02:08:19,583
I didn't know why, but I thought
that the change was good.

1938
02:08:21,042 --> 02:08:22,208
Now, I understood...

1939
02:08:22,583 --> 02:08:24,333
the real reason behind the change
in your attitude.

1940
02:08:26,875 --> 02:08:29,417
Today you are acting
like your old self

1941
02:08:29,833 --> 02:08:31,042
after knowing that you're
from the same caste.

1942
02:08:31,875 --> 02:08:33,708
Do you even have a character?

1943
02:08:48,250 --> 02:08:52,208
Since childhood, I thought
everyone would be like you.

1944
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:54,917
That is when I met him.

1945
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:58,333
He is always very happy.

1946
02:08:59,208 --> 02:09:03,542
When he faces a problem,
he only thinks of possible solutions.

1947
02:09:04,833 --> 02:09:08,083
He doesn't worry about his relatives
or our society.

1948
02:09:08,833 --> 02:09:10,875
There is no fear or weakness in him.

1949
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:14,208
That is why I liked him even more.

1950
02:09:15,292 --> 02:09:19,083
I will be happy if I stay with him.

1951
02:09:21,917 --> 02:09:24,083
I was like that as a child.

1952
02:09:25,542 --> 02:09:27,708
I became like that again
after he came into my life.

1953
02:09:29,875 --> 02:09:30,958
That's Hari.

1954
02:09:35,833 --> 02:09:37,458
What we did is wrong.

1955
02:09:40,625 --> 02:09:42,333
I like him a lot.

1956
02:09:43,583 --> 02:09:48,333
But I left him
because I made a promise to you.

1957
02:09:51,333 --> 02:09:52,958
I tried to forget him.

1958
02:09:54,625 --> 02:09:55,833
But I couldn't.

1959
02:09:57,625 --> 02:10:00,958
It was the hardest thing for me
in my entire life.

1960
02:10:01,375 --> 02:10:02,708
To let go of Hari.

1961
02:10:07,833 --> 02:10:12,500
Any girl would think of her father
whenever she is in a big problem.

1962
02:10:13,667 --> 02:10:15,958
She hopes that her dad will come
and solve her problem.

1963
02:10:18,708 --> 02:10:20,917
I too had hope that

1964
02:10:21,542 --> 02:10:25,458
you would understand my situation.

1965
02:10:29,917 --> 02:10:32,833
But now when I see you like this...

1966
02:10:34,125 --> 02:10:35,583
I lost that hope.

1967
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,708
So I will call off my wedding with Hari.

1968
02:10:43,833 --> 02:10:46,333
Otherwise, you will torture Mom lifelong.

1969
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,583
I made a grave mistake.

1970
02:11:12,875 --> 02:11:14,833
I tried to solve the problem.

1971
02:11:15,625 --> 02:11:17,958
I never expected that it would create
a rift between you and your dad.

1972
02:11:19,208 --> 02:11:20,333
It's not your fault.

1973
02:11:21,208 --> 02:11:23,083
It was bound to happen.

1974
02:11:27,208 --> 02:11:28,583
What should we do now, Hari?

1975
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:30,667
Let's kiss.

1976
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:32,917
It's the best solution for everything.

1977
02:11:35,625 --> 02:11:36,542
Let's fight.

1978
02:11:37,792 --> 02:11:39,833
Let's fight silently
until your dad agrees.

1979
02:11:40,333 --> 02:11:43,333
Why? I expected
that you would suggest eloping.

1980
02:11:51,958 --> 02:11:53,708
<i>"Our caste, our people."</i>

1981
02:11:53,917 --> 02:11:56,333
<i>That feeling creates cowardice</i>
<i>in us without our knowledge.</i>

1982
02:11:56,917 --> 02:12:02,750
<i>It corrupts our character</i>
<i>and kills humanity.</i>

1983
02:12:02,958 --> 02:12:05,083
<i>It will leave us unhappy.</i>

1984
02:12:08,875 --> 02:12:09,958
Srinu.

1985
02:12:42,750 --> 02:12:44,458
<i>Harathi is strong like my mother.</i>

1986
02:12:44,917 --> 02:12:46,333
<i>She talks like my mother.</i>

1987
02:12:46,542 --> 02:12:48,333
<i>She's kind, just like my mother.</i>

1988
02:13:01,417 --> 02:13:02,250
What?

1989
02:13:02,333 --> 02:13:04,458
Your parents went out, come home.

1990
02:13:04,917 --> 02:13:06,833
-What for?
-You asked for a kiss, didn't you?

1991
02:13:07,542 --> 02:13:09,333
-On my way.
-Hail...

1992
02:13:10,083 --> 02:13:11,917
No way. I won't come.

1993
02:13:12,292 --> 02:13:14,875
-I am telling the truth.
-I won't come.

1994
02:13:14,958 --> 02:13:16,417
<i>I am asking you to come home.</i>
