1
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,204
Gopala Krishna, Krishna Gopala..

2
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:18,043
Gopala Govinda, redeem all..

3
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,484
Gopala Krishna, Krishna Gopala..

4
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:25,051
Gopala Govinda, redeem all..

5
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,889
Gopala Krishna, Krishna Gopala..

6
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,162
Gopala Govinda, redeem all..

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:38,229
Brother, listen. There is some
Anandi Devi in this village.

8
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,236
Can you tell me her address?

9
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,899
Which Anandi Devi? The
one near the garden..

10
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,238
..or the one from Dhaulpur?

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,369
The one from the garden
or from Dhaulpur?

12
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,913
Is she a widow?

13
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,242
Is she? Yes. She is a widow.

14
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,908
Then you do like this. You
go straight ahead and ask..

15
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,920
..anyone where the old lady
of the garden stays.

16
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,251
Old lady of the garden?

17
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,918
She has a mango grove. So all
call her old lady of the garden.

18
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,925
The old lady of the garden.

19
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,929
Ask anyone as Anandi Devi
of the garden. - Okay.

20
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,938
I am going, aunty.

21
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,536
Okay.

22
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,940
One slipper is on the other,
aunty. It is said..

23
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,105
..this happens when there
is a journey to be made.

24
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:26,117
Now daughter, only one
journey is left for me.

25
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,480
Four people will carry me
away to the graveyard.

26
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,550
Aunty, let your enemies die!

27
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,966
Who?

28
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,313
Aunty.. I touch
your feet, aunty.

29
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,977
Live long, live long.
Who are you, son?

30
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,047
I did not recognise you.

31
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:06,316
How will you recognise me,
aunty? I was very young then.

32
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,984
Your husband Niranjan babu was
the uncle of my father..

33
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,997
..Girdhari babu. I am his son.

34
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,332
Girdhari! The one
from Mutthiganj?

35
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,596
Yes. I am his son, Arun.

36
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:23,338
Okay. So you are Girdhari's
son. Come, son, sit

37
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,004
Take the cot this side.
- Okay.

38
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,179
...
Is everything well at home?

39
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,015
Everything is well by your
blessings. I work in the city.

40
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,556
I am an insurance agent.

41
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,018
How is Girdhari Lal?

42
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,362
My father has expired,
it is three years.

43
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,366
You did not inform me.

44
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:54,031
How could we? We didn't even
know that till now you were..

45
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:58,043
..that you were living
here till now.

46
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:06,442
I too did not inform anyone
else. I spent many years here.

47
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,388
I had forgotten that there is
a life outside this place also.

48
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,053
How is your mother?

49
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,389
She expired one year
prior to father.

50
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,061
Everyone has gone one by one.
Only I am still..

51
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,072
..bound with this soil.

52
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,407
I have come here for that
reason only, aunty..

53
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,602
..so that I may take you
with me to the city.

54
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:36,076
I came to know that you
were living alone here..

55
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,414
..Iike this in the village.
I felt very bad.

56
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:44,081
Lata got so scared. I mean,
your daughter-in-law.

57
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,087
She said it does not look nice
if you remain in the village..

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,594
..Iike this when we are alive.

59
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:54,099
Long live, my son. I seems
very nice to hear..

60
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,601
..that I too have some relative
who has come to fetch me.

61
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,598
Take this, have some tea.

62
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,264
Oh, oh, I say..

63
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,109
It is hot.

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,640
I say get ready. Let us go by
the evening train itself.

65
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:13,279
The train is at 4 o'clock. We
shall reach the city by evening.

66
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,117
Now where will I go out of this
threshold in this age, my son..

67
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:24,129
..I am habituated to this
place. So what if it is ramshackle?

68
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:28,657
It is still a house. I have
a small mango grove here.

69
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,638
I think it bears fruit
still just for me.

70
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,132
I am not telling you to
leave all this, aunty.

71
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,136
When you feel like,
come and see.

72
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,306
How far is the city from here?
Just a couple of hours away.

73
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,141
If you are getting some money
out of this holding..

74
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,480
..then why should you leave it?

75
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:50,613
No, no, son. I do not think
of money. Think that..

76
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:57,152
..this all has become my
family. When I sit alone..

77
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,326
..in the courtyard, then this
mud walls speak to me.

78
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:07,335
These windows, these doors,
all talk with me.

79
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:13,502
Talks of old times. There used
to be a crowd of people here.

80
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,507
There used to be excitement
here always.

81
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:23,783
On this courtyard, my
mother-in-law had put some paddy.

82
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,185
She had put oil on it.

83
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,518
That was the first time
I came as a bride.

84
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,700
The fellow gets married!

85
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,209
All right, all right.

86
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,549
Come on, the procession
has come..

87
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,746
Is there something stolen here
that you are peeping thus?

88
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,223
Run away from here. Go.

89
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,290
I performed all the seven
rounds to bring you here.

90
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,226
I did not bring you just like
that from someone's house.

91
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,570
You were quite impatient
to get married.

92
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,645
I had heard your name is Anandi.

93
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,244
I cannot see any joy
on your face though.

94
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:31,250
Why are you so stiff? Have
they starched and sent you?

95
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,423
She moves like a guard's flag.

96
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,259
Come here.

97
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,793
Did you not hear? Come here.

98
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,601
Come here or I shall slap
you and break your teeth.

99
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,609
The donkey of a launderer.

100
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,618
The tears have welled
up in the eyes.

101
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,622
Take this handkerchief. Wipe
the tears. Wipe the tears..

102
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:09,286
Wipe them off. I'll leave you
today, but if you shed these..

103
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:14,766
..tears again, I shall
cover these eyes.

104
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,462
Turn around and look at me.

105
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,301
Mother was telling she
has got me a fairy..

106
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,845
..there's nothing like that.

107
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,648
How much have you studied?
How much have you studied?

108
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,316
I have studied Hindi
till fourth grade.

109
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,715
Were you going to a school?

110
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,655
No! My father used to
teach me at home.

111
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,659
Thanks that you spoke at least.

112
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,661
I thought mother got some
dumb girl for me.

113
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,995
Sit here. Sit here.

114
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,670
Till when will you stand
here hurting your feet?

115
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,502
Now let me tell you some
important things.

116
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,675
There is a drama company
in this village..

117
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:05,843
..where I have to go everyday.
Hence I shall be late at night.

118
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,353
I cannot tell you how
late you will be.

119
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:12,351
Yes. I shall sometimes
return drunk on toddy.

120
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:18,688
Do you know what toddy
means? Alcohol.

121
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,528
All the celebrated poets and
artistes used to drink.

122
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:27,637
From Khayyam to Ghalib and
from Ghalib to Niranjan.

123
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:32,710
See, if I tell you something
untoward after getting drunk..

124
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:38,375
..then forgive me. If you try
to fight, I shall beat you up.

125
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:46,725
It must be fifty years ago.
But that booming voice..

126
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,387
..of that night is still
etched on my ears.

127
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,892
It seems as if it were
just yesterday.

128
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,398
But he was very short-tempered.
He would say..

129
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,406
..any nonsense for
trivial things.

130
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:06,744
But he had a good heart.
He was very charitable.

131
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,739
Kindness to people, service
to the village.

132
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,752
Those days there was a flood
in the river, when..

133
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,947
..so many villages
were destroyed.

134
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,425
He ran from pillar to
post in the village.

135
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,893
Is there a need to go
purposefully into danger?

136
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,823
You know what a big epidemic
is spread there.

137
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,695
If there is an epidemic there,
shall I sit here by your feet?

138
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,896
I should help them. Shanker,
Shibu, Dinu, all are going.

139
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,438
I am not going alone.

140
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,776
Shanker, lift this bundle of
clothes. I will take the grain.

141
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,441
Take a sack more if you have.
We'll ask some grain and..

142
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,508
..Ientils on the way.

143
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,610
Is there anything in the brain
or has an eagle taken it away?

144
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,622
Those who will give grain,
won't they give a sack also?

145
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,727
Let it be, brother.
I'll carry it.

146
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,463
Listen..

147
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,800
Will you return by evening?

148
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,064
I do not know.

149
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,803
Look! If you do not return by
evening, you'll see me dead.

150
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,817
That was the last
time I saw him.

151
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,824
What an inauspicious
moment that was..

152
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,832
..when I gave him that promise.

153
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,502
I could not even see his face.
I could not even see him..

154
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,005
..for the last time.

155
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,499
Why? What had happened?

156
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:48,507
He had gone to some far-off
place to distribute charity.

157
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,848
There only he attracted
some epidemic..

158
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,680
..and died struggling
against it.

159
00:10:56,055 --> 00:11:02,051
Since then, I am passing my
days remembering those old days.

160
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,988
Hence I have come
to take you, aunty.

161
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,523
After all, I too have some
responsibility towards you.

162
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:15,703
You are right, son. I too am
fearful of living alone now.

163
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,876
Can't say when my limbs
will fail and..

164
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,139
..when I shall have to remain
helpless in a corner.

165
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,541
If I had someone
to call my own..

166
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,710
..they would have performed
my last rites.

167
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,555
I don't know who all
will touch this body.

168
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,560
No aunty, now you will
not have to live alone.

169
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:41,094
Live with us as our
mother. Come on.

170
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,028
Stop here, carriage driver.

171
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,696
Come, aunty.

172
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,699
Careful.

173
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,877
Take this, driver.

174
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,058
Aunty..
- Yes, Lata.

175
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,058
I touch your feet.
- Long live, daughter.

176
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,734
See this. We are here and you
are living alone in the village.

177
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,932
Does anyone do this? We
don't have a mother.

178
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,907
It will be so good if you
stay with us as our mother.

179
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,738
And then.. I am doubly
related to you.

180
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,741
Yes.. one on Arun's side and
another on my mother's side.

181
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,088
Arun..
- Yes?

182
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,147
Your wife speaks very well..

183
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,089
She has learnt in a
Madras isn't it?

184
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,162
Yes. I did my BA anyhow.

185
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,156
All girls have to marry, girl.

186
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,363
Not marriage, aunty.. B..

187
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,769
That is a very big degree,
aunty. She has done BA..

188
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,241
..in economics. Lots of brains
are needed for economics.

189
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,939
One doesn't praise like
this in front of elders.

190
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,446
Daughter-in-law, what is this?
- What?

191
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,780
Come here.

192
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,785
Why did you cut your hair?
How short you have made..

193
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,126
..your like just like the boys.
Don't you braid them?

194
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,130
No, aunty. That takes
a lot of time.

195
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,132
Who can take care
of such long hair?

196
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,138
It was not like that in our
time. A girl was said to be..

197
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,141
..more beautiful if
she had longer hair.

198
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,303
But in that age, only hair were
beautiful, aunty, not girls.

199
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,974
Do not tell like this, son.
Now I have grown old.

200
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,815
But in those days I was no less
beautiful than your wife.

201
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,153
Your Grandson, aunty.

202
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,094
Go son, go to your grandma.

203
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:12,829
My young baby. My moon,
my darling!

204
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,306
He is so happy with
his grandmother.

205
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,002
After all, our own are our own,
they are blood, isn't it?

206
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:22,373
Daughter-in-law, your
son is like a doll.

207
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,182
But you should have
a girl this time.

208
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,015
Come on, aunty. I will
show you the bathroom.

209
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,023
Freshen up. Like that.. there
is a tap on the terrace.

210
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,320
It has the holy water
of the Ganges.

211
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,259
Bathe there everyday
if you so wish.

212
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,860
Hey.. the life should
be big, not long.

213
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,869
Rajesh Khanna's new form..
in the movie Anand..

214
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:53,868
You are the queen of the water..

215
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:03,280
You are the queen of the water..

216
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:13,493
You are the queen of the water..

217
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,296
Give me ten paise.

218
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,233
Who are you?

219
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:23,297
I am hungry. Me and Tini too.
Give me ten paise.

220
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,906
Tini? Who is Tini?
She is my sister.

221
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,513
She cannot walk. She
stays at home.

222
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,072
Please give me ten paise.

223
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,311
What kind of parents
do you have?

224
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,255
They don't give you
anything to eat?

225
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,383
And they sent you
outside? Here..

226
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,424
Take something from the
market and eat, okay?

227
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,935
It is such a strange place.
Milk drinking children..

228
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,939
..roam around hungry
in the streets.

229
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,934
Billu.. wait.. don't go..
I tell you.. don't go..

230
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,207
They are stronger..
don't go.. wait..

231
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,406
There will be a fight.
Don't go..

232
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,415
Let me go.. there
will be a fight!

233
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,348
Let there be a fight. I'll
teach everyone a lesson.

234
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,942
Don't go. Let it be.
Shyam has told..

235
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,487
..us not to go to them all
alone. They have bombs.

236
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,954
They have bombs! Are you
scared of them?

237
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,217
If you are scared of bombs,
you can go..

238
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,553
I am not scared of bombs.
They will come in our locality..

239
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,149
..and have fun.
- And I should sit like this?

240
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,491
Then go and die. How
am I connected?

241
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,962
I will go and tell Shyam.

242
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,124
Shyam.. Shyam.. he is the
only one around here.

243
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,305
God.. what language do they
speak?

244
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,966
I don't understand anything.

245
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,973
They haven't even broken
their milk teeth.

246
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:39,581
And look at their eyes.
They are so bloodshot..

247
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,150
Give me a cup of tea.

248
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,988
Wait.. I am giving you.

249
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,453
Rambharose, give me biscuits
for ten paise.

250
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,997
Biscuits for ten paise..
- Ramu.. come here..

251
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,997
Come here. Who gave this money?

252
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,333
That woman gave it to me.

253
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,997
That woman? Did you
people hear that?

254
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,541
It isn't even a week that
he has taken birth..

255
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,338
..and he has already
found a woman.

256
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,004
Neelu.. what is that called?

257
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,015
The tin cock on the roofs
of the big buildings?

258
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,015
The one who changes it's
stance with the wind..

259
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:20,357
Weather cock? - Yes.. that
one.. weather cock..

260
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,619
Why, what happened?

261
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,423
I don't know the weather
of this country.

262
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,554
Why?

263
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,191
The scrambled egg is same, the
cock's face has changed.

264
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,358
What do you say, friend?
- Yes, of course.

265
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,034
Rambharose, give me some tea.

266
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,041
Even the most communal
and selfish..

267
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,203
..parties are taking advantage
in the name of socialism.

268
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:44,313
They don't do anything.
They just give speeches.

269
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,044
Isn't it?
- Yes.

270
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:50,382
Neelu.. I gave you knowledge
till so long.

271
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,047
Why don't you at least treat
me to a cup of tea?

272
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,324
You were giving knowledge
and I was paying attention.

273
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,056
Where does the tea
come in between?

274
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,062
Rambharose..
- Yes?

275
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,069
Give me one more cup of tea.
In Neelu's account.

276
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:11,073
Shyam.. Shyam.. that Chinu
from Raghu's camp..

277
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,576
He is moving around
in our locality.

278
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,543
I think that there
is something amiss.

279
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,672
Forget all that. I will go
and rectify it right now.

280
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,238
He was saying that
you had said no?

281
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,079
Yes. I had said no.
Don't go empty..

282
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:27,091
..handed to any of Sainu's camp.

283
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,088
They will surely have daggers,
bombs or something else.

284
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,556
Kabeer, should I come,
or I will go?

285
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,101
I will do it right away.
- Come on..

286
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,433
Listen.. don't hit them.
Just bring them here.

287
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,268
Okay. - And Billu.. sit here.

288
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,365
When everyone is going, what
will I do alone here?

289
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,276
Sit here. You get
angry very soon.

290
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,115
Here.. have this tea.

291
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,137
Hey, old woman.. come on.. run
away from here. Get lost..

292
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:28,485
Oh.. do you speak like
this to the elderly?

293
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,679
Didn't you learn speaking
with respect?

294
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,747
I will give you a tight slap
and swerve your face.

295
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,314
Do you know whom you
are speaking too?

296
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,493
Yes.. I know.. I am
speaking to someone..

297
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,655
..who is as the same
age as my grandson.

298
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,166
If I pinch his cheeks, milk
will come out even today.

299
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:47,166
He doesn't even have
a way to speak..

300
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,433
There weren't even so
many books then..

301
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,173
Even then.. boys spoke
as grandma and aunty..

302
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,505
It is such a modern world..

303
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:04,578
Oh.. so it is our Mr.
Raghunath. - Greetings.. greetings.

304
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,715
What is the matter, we cannot
see you nowadays at all..

305
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,521
you are seen once a
blue moon nowadays.

306
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,528
Our eyes are yearning
to see you.

307
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:16,192
No fun, no teasing nothing..

308
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,693
You have broken our heart.

309
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,262
You don't need to show
your teeth to me.

310
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:25,469
Shut up! - Sarju, make your
friend be silent. He abuses!

311
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,478
Friend, don't abuse.
It isn't good.

312
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,538
Yes, you were speaking
about some teeth.

313
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,547
Are your teeth bad? Is there
some worm or something?

314
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,549
Therefore, it is stinking.

315
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,214
Nowadays, you laugh and joke
with your father too?

316
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,755
Oh! Father.

317
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,693
Friend.. don't talk about
fathers. - Sorry.

318
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,696
I was just saying that..

319
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:49,222
..we don't see your beautiful
face nowadays.

320
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:55,504
Your beautiful face.. no
blemish should fall on it..

321
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,239
Oh.. these eyes..

322
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,411
Hey.. they are rioting..

323
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,711
Are you hitting me just
because I am alone?

324
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,252
That poor soul will die.

325
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,516
Don't hit him.. Shyam
has said no..

326
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,589
I am telling you,
don't hit him..

327
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,863
Oh.. don't hit him..
Shyam has said no..

328
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,791
Enough. Enough.. Shyam has
said no.. don't hit him..

329
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:32,605
Daughter-in-law..
daughter-in-law.. see..

330
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,441
They are hitting the boy.
- Please come upstairs, aunt.

331
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,549
See. What injustice
is this? See..

332
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,281
Please come upstairs, come
upstairs with Pinky.

333
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,616
Oh.. god..

334
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,282
Ram's name is the truth.

335
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,824
Ram's name is the truth.

336
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,557
Ram's name is the truth..

337
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:58,302
Oh god.. they hit and almost
killed that poor boy.

338
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,370
These boys don't even
have some pity.

339
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,633
Please don't keep Pinky
out for so long.

340
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,309
If you see sparks here, there
will be fire here too.

341
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,638
You will see.. you will see
daggers and bombs right now.

342
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,580
Look at this Shyam, we got
this from his pockets.

343
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,490
Shyam.. please don't do
all this in our shop.

344
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,820
If the police comes sometimes..

345
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,328
Why were you roaming around
with a dagger in this locality?

346
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,334
It is my wish. Nobody's father
owns this locality.

347
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,875
I will take your tongue away.

348
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,874
Does only your father
Sainu have a dagger?

349
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:48,352
Does nobody else have it? Come
on.. stand up.. stand up..

350
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,687
Tell me, why did you
come to the locality?

351
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,954
I had come to meet
my girlfriend.

352
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,359
And who is your girlfriend?

353
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,355
Savita.
- Who is this Savita?

354
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:04,628
That Chikoo of the chikoo tree.
By god, she is very spicy.

355
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,695
How are you related to Savita?

356
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,707
Is she your mother that
you ask about her?

357
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,872
That is good.. my
turn will come too.

358
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:20,845
I will teach a lesson
to everyone.

359
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,379
Hey. What is all this?
Why are you fighting?

360
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,388
Go, please look after
your own matters.

361
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,721
Don't meddle in our matters.

362
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,921
Wow.. riots are your
own matter now?

363
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,388
Didn't I tell you to go away?

364
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:41,399
This whole locality is full
of wastrels.. no education..

365
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,941
Hey.. who are you saying
is a wastrel?

366
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,738
Say it once again..

367
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,937
He is Savita's father.. the
one.. Raghu's girlfriend..

368
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,578
Oh.. please listen..

369
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,413
You asked why we were
fighting, isn't it?

370
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:00,916
Look at that boy lying there.
Look at him carefully.

371
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,418
Do you know who he is?

372
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,592
There is a famous hooligan in
the nearby locality, Chenu.

373
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:10,426
He is from his clan. Do you
know why he came here?

374
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,436
To meet your daughter. He wants
to be your son-in-law.

375
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,605
Did you like your son-in-law?
Tell me if you did.

376
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,779
I will have her married
right away.

377
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,843
You immoral stupid rascal!
- Shut up!

378
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:31,117
Shyam, you left your studies.
Did you..

379
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,850
..Ieave all manners to speak
to your elders too?

380
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,722
Have you forgotten how you
speak to elders?

381
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,795
You were going to the office,
isn't it? Go the office.

382
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,626
Please don't meddle
in our matters.

383
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,857
I feel so sad looking
at these boys.

384
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:49,803
We don't need your sympathies,
you can go..

385
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,871
Hey. Catch him. Catch him..

386
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,479
Catch him!

387
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,481
Oh god..

388
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,889
What kind of world is this?

389
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,022
Everyone seems to be God's own.

390
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,833
But look at their antics.
It seems that..

391
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,835
..they have taken the
hell on their heads.

392
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:25,842
Oh.. daughter-in-law.. why have
you worn Arun's clothes?

393
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:30,504
These are not Arun's clothes.
They are my clothes.

394
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,507
But these pantaloons?

395
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,518
Everyone wears it nowadays,
aunty.

396
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,913
Who will go around looking
after six yards of saree?

397
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,686
You cannot take care of
six yards of saree?

398
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,986
You cannot take care
of your hair.

399
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,529
It would have been better
if you were born a man.

400
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:49,533
Of course. If I were a man,
I'd have shown these men!

401
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,928
Come quickly.. it is late.

402
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,699
I am ready since so long.
You make us late everyday.

403
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,532
When you drink ten cups of tea..

404
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,702
..only then do you get
up from the bed.

405
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:04,074
Where is today's newspaper.
Yes.. it is here.

406
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,075
And then you take the
paper and sit there.

407
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,216
As if you are sitting in
some big central library.

408
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,886
Shall I leave, aunty, please
take care of Pinky.

409
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,551
Nothing more.. just
have her bathe..

410
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,723
..and powder and then
dress her up.

411
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,561
And feed her the milk
at three. And then..

412
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,568
..take her for a stroll
at six in the evening.

413
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,901
I will come by that time.
- But where are you going?

414
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:32,567
To the office, for work..
- For work? - Yes.

415
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,572
She works in the office too.

416
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,579
How can one work and earn
for the household alone?

417
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,583
Then.. is she paid too?

418
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,917
Yes, she is paid four
hundred per month.

419
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:47,082
We will leave now..
Come on.. we are already late.

420
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,591
We will leave, aunty..

421
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,933
Oh.. I am really tired..

422
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:02,767
Where have all of us come?
All are running..

423
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:07,603
Running.. everything
has changed..

424
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,004
When did all this change?

425
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,613
Whoever I see, seems crazy.

426
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:20,123
Girls don't seem to
be girls and boys..

427
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,620
Beloved.. my life..

428
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:30,132
Dushyant.. my beloved..
Dushyant.. my love..

429
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:35,805
You are going.. you
are forgetting me..

430
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:39,104
I will dance in the forests..

431
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,907
..and speak to the leaves
without you..

432
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,643
What are you doing?

433
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,648
I am getting ready
for a new drama.

434
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,119
Shakuntala. See how I will
work as Shakuntala.

435
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,917
And who will become Shakuntala?

436
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,048
Me. Who else?

437
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,648
Shakuntala was very beautiful.

438
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:55,988
So me..

439
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,930
I will nail your tongue
if you talk a lot.

440
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:20,677
Are you angry? Listen to me..
try to understand..

441
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,677
This doing work of
women is difficult.

442
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,686
Your attitudes..
your movements..

443
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,954
How you walk around, your
gait.. akin to a cut kite..

444
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,895
Someone else does it
and show it to me?

445
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,694
I will break my birth string.

446
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,696
Let the drama start.

447
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,700
I will work like Shakuntala
like this.. you will be stunned.

448
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,705
Yes.. you do a new
drama everyday..

449
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,710
..and all my sarees will
be ruined everyday.

450
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,109
You wasted six sarees in
Draupadi's clothes removal scene.

451
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,876
Did you father send
these sarees?

452
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,051
Don't talk about my father,
I will tell you.

453
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,888
That's it.. I said it to his
mouth. Why should I keep silent?

454
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:05,890
We fought a lot that night.
The next day..

455
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,227
..he bought three
new sarees for me.

456
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,725
Wow.. the daughter-in-law
of such..

457
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:15,239
..a rich household has to
work for two times food?

458
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,906
Work? What kind of work?

459
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,341
So, don't they pay you anything?

460
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,076
They will just give you food?

461
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:31,747
Work? Food? What are you saying?

462
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,751
What work do I do?

463
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:37,755
Yes.. you take care of this
child all through the day.

464
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,763
You bathe him, feed
him, clothe him..

465
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,765
..and then you go with
him for a stroll.

466
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,095
Is this all not work?

467
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:48,104
Is this some work? I play
with this toy all the time.

468
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:51,107
I have my own house,
my relatives..

469
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:54,110
Yes, relatives..

470
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,770
Today, when the child has
to be taken care of..

471
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,781
..they remembered their
relatives, isn't it?

472
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,784
See, I don't understand
what you are saying.

473
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,115
How can I make you understand?

474
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,384
Sir and madam, both go to work.

475
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,949
They need someone to look
after the child, isn't it?

476
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,393
A maid will take at
least thirty rupees.

477
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,987
The food and clothes
are different.

478
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:17,057
Calling you aunt, both of
them save their money.

479
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,997
They had brought someone
else before you too.

480
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:23,404
They called her aunt too.
But she was very smart.

481
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:28,275
She understood everything. She
ate food, took the clothes.

482
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:32,806
And she took a salary too. She
got a nice job soon. She left.

483
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:42,355
Relatives.. relations.. Iove..
all of them are priced, god.

484
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,824
Everything has started
to be sold.

485
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:50,161
The old woman seems good. She
takes care of the child too.

486
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,164
If only, she stays..

487
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,168
She will stay. She
will surely stay.

488
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,000
Just speak to her
and call her aunt.

489
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:00,836
And take sweets everyday.
She won't go anywhere.

490
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,173
But you had brought some
old woman before too.

491
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,374
Did we not look after her?

492
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,843
That old woman was
very intelligent.

493
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:14,349
Oh god. We got time to come to
a restaurant after so long!

494
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,856
Because of this Pinky, we
had to rush home at six.

495
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,330
Will you do something?
- Yes.

496
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,868
Give the old woman ten to
twelve rupees every week.

497
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:29,196
Are you crazy? You want to show
the cat the vat of milk?

498
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,869
You will give her ten
today, tomorrow..

499
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,342
..she will ask for twenty
and then twenty five.

500
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,879
I ask you, instead of
giving her money..

501
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,280
..why don't we buy a refrigerator on
installments with the same?

502
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,353
We could never buy a refrigerator
till today. Really.

503
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,887
The expenses are so much..

504
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:50,394
What is it? Why are you smiling?

505
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,559
Nothing.
- It is something.

506
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:59,065
I was thinking. You are pretty
smart in trapping old women.

507
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:45,281
Who is it? Where have
you come from?

508
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,941
Does Mr. Arun Gupta reside here?

509
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,210
Yes. He does. But he isn't
here at this time.

510
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,550
He is in his office.
- Yes, I know.

511
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,283
I know that he is in the
office at this time.

512
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,951
I am his brother. - Brother..
- I am his uncle's son.

513
00:34:56,227 --> 00:35:00,425
The woman.. widow..
Anandidevi.. does she stay here?

514
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:01,965
Yes, she does.

515
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,295
Can I meet her?

516
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,131
Come inside and have a seat.
I will call her. - Okay.

517
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:28,982
Aunty.. aunty.. you
didn't recognize me?

518
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:33,989
You didn't recognize me. How
will you recognize me?

519
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,157
You saw me when
I was very young.

520
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,997
How will you recognize me?

521
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,334
You saw me when
I was very young.

522
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:47,343
Your aunty's brother-in-law..
I am his relative's son. Jatin.

523
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:48,503
Jotu!

524
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,005
It's all right.

525
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,009
How did you find out about me?

526
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:00,182
I went to your village. I found
out that you came to meet Arun.

527
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,521
So, I came to meet you too.
- Did you have any work with me?

528
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:09,430
No. I didn't have any work.
Can I sit, aunty? - Sit.

529
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:16,200
Are you married? - Yes, Neelu.
I mean, my wife's name.

530
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,035
Do you have children?
- Yes, I have a daughter.

531
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:23,208
Does your wife call
you by your name?

532
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:27,317
Jotu.. she calls me Jotu..

533
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:31,386
Your wife has done BA,
and goes to the office?

534
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:36,050
Yes, she has done her MA.
But how do you know?

535
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:42,060
Your wife, whom you call Neelu,
she must have sent you to me.

536
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:46,402
She must have said,
our poor aunty..

537
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,405
We don't know how she is
spending her days in the village.

538
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:54,536
Go.. go and bring her. She will
stay with us.. Iike a mother.

539
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:58,070
Yes, you are right. Neelu said..

540
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,410
Didn't I tell you what
Neelu said? - Yes..

541
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,614
People call strangers their
own, when their own are fake.

542
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:13,258
I have learnt about ours and
others coming to the city.

543
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,594
Yes.. that is right..
that has to happen.

544
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:22,602
As it is.. you have come..
my relative.. my own..

545
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,273
What salary will you give me?

546
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,276
Salary? You mean.. money..

547
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,645
Wow.. you wife and husband
will go to work.

548
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,122
You will see the bioscope,
and stroll around.

549
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,719
I will take care of your
daughter all day.

550
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,658
Won't you pay me anything
for that?

551
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,664
You are my relative,
you are my aunt.

552
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,290
I know, son.

553
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,127
My blood aunt, her real
brother-in-law..

554
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:56,731
..his in- law's son.. right?
What will you pay me?

555
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,668
Fifteen..

556
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:04,313
No.. not fifteen. Twenty rupees.

557
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,742
Okay, I will pay you twenty.

558
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,477
You will give me
food and clothes.

559
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,316
Is it something to
be said to our own?

560
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:17,323
All right..
- Don't say all right wrongly.

561
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:24,330
Go home, and speak to Neelu
at night and ask her.

562
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,763
If she agrees, come
at this time.

563
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:32,167
Don't come on a holiday.
My relatives are at home.

564
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,504
Okay.

565
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,704
Greetings, aunty.
- Bless you.

566
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,186
Greetings.

567
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,794
Hey.. hey.. give me ten paise.
- I don't have it, son..

568
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:04,464
Please. Give me some food. -
Didn't I tell you I don't have it.

569
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:09,206
See, my pant is torn,
get me a new one.

570
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,813
Didn't I tell you that
I don't have anything?

571
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,475
If you don't have anything,
come on.. we will beg together.

572
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,209
What? We will beg?
- Yes!

573
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,221
Hey, Babu.. come here..

574
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,759
Did you eat?

575
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,229
Go to Rambharose and take
biscuits from him.

576
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:31,394
Tell him my name. And listen,
take them for Tini too.

577
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,737
Shyam.. where are you off to?

578
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,231
That Manu and Billy had gone
to college in the morning.

579
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,571
They haven't returned as yet.

580
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:42,578
College? The college is closed,
there is a strike.

581
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,415
Silent.. silent.. silent..

582
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,585
Why have you come here?
What do you want?

583
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,248
Give us the dates. When will
our examination take place?

584
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,255
We will tell you when
the dates arrive.

585
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,793
But all the other colleges
have information.

586
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,421
But we didn't get
any information.

587
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,657
And if you want to know more,
go to the university.

588
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,529
Nobody speaks to
us nicely there.

589
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,795
They speak to us like peons.

590
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,804
I am not responsible for that.
Go.. go away from here.

591
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,272
Then you tell us,
what should we do?

592
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,275
Go and study, what
else will you do?

593
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,536
But where should we study? The
college is closed always.

594
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,273
There is a strike all the time.

595
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,814
You are the people who
make these strikes.

596
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,782
The principal is not
responsible for this.

597
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,682
We don't keep strikes, we
are forced to strike!

598
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,553
I don't know all that. You
get out.. just get out.

599
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,756
Is it? This is it?

600
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,488
Come on.. there will be
no bamboo and no flute.

601
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,826
We don't want the college
which don't keep classes.

602
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:38,301
Come on! Come on!

603
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,634
Break it! Break it!

604
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,297
Destroy it!

605
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,669
This is the principal speaking.
Yes, immediately.

606
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,538
Send the police immediately.
Send them right now.

607
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,942
Or else, they will destroy
all the furniture.

608
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:30,351
Police! Police!

609
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,702
Billu.. Billu.. come on.. they
have called the police.

610
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,429
Where is Tinu?
- He has left a long while back.

611
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,371
He must already have reached.

612
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:15,390
Tell me, son. Where
will you go now?

613
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:19,559
Where will he go? Come on..
take him to the worms.

614
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:24,672
Billu.. I tell you.. this
is not the time to fight..

615
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:30,738
Come on.. Billu.. Billu..
- You go away if you want to.

616
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,416
Four for one.. I will
teach you a lesson..

617
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,430
Shyam, while we were returning
from the college..

618
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,442
That Raghu and all..
they took him away!

619
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,039
Where did they go? Where?

620
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,444
Towards Keedgang.
I told him a lot.

621
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,040
That they are too many.
Let us run away.

622
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,783
But does he listen to anyone?

623
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:14,451
Okay. You reach there
with Vanmali and Kusal.

624
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,459
I'll meet you on the side street.

625
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,478
Neelu.. hold this bomb.

626
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,512
Nobody will do anything till
I don't say so. Okay?

627
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,525
Chainu!

628
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,000
Where is my pistol?

629
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:38,030
Chainu.. come out if you
are your father's son.

630
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:42,539
Face me like a man if you
want to challenge me.

631
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,874
Let me see how strong you are!

632
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,150
There are some people here
too. They have bombs.

633
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:53,086
Shall I come in, or
will you come out?

634
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,557
Very good, Shyam..

635
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,561
Shyam!

636
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:24,079
Chainu.. if you hit
Billu once more..

637
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:31,757
Remember.. all the bullets in
this pistol will be in your head.

638
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:36,599
Chainu.. your remember, I went
to prison for you once.

639
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,065
You remember that, don't you?

640
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:42,196
My whole life changed and
was ruined because of you.

641
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,598
But this time.. I will
not go to prison.

642
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:48,002
I will kill you and be hanged.

643
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,611
Raghu..

644
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,610
Let him go!

645
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,969
Come on.. fool. If you
do this the next time..

646
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,974
..I will tie you myself.

647
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:28,814
Chainu.. I don't like
this fighting anymore.

648
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,817
Leave it.. forget this enmity.

649
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,062
Shyam..

650
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:54,667
Even I have a gun.
You are fortunate..

651
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,009
..that I don't have
it with me right now.

652
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,847
Keep it near you the next time.

653
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,692
Life in this locality
is difficult.

654
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,704
Someone takes them, or
they bring someone.

655
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:26,868
Forget it, leave this locality,
we will go somewhere else.

656
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,706
What will be done if we
leave the locality?

657
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,879
It isn't about just one
locality or place.

658
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,312
This is going on all
around the country.

659
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,919
Everything is all right.

660
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,255
We are well.

661
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:25,032
Everything is all right.

662
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,770
We are well.

663
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,296
We have done our BA.

664
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,103
We have done our MA.

665
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:34,938
I think but why did we even do that.

666
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,842
We have done our BA.

667
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,245
We have done our MA.

668
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:41,284
I think but why did we even do that.

669
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:45,046
We don't have any price
other than that..

670
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,784
We are all right due to you..

671
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,787
Everything is all right.

672
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:54,195
We are well.

673
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,807
The atmosphere.

674
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:14,317
The atmosphere of the
country is very good.

675
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:17,410
There is law and order,
everything is all right.

676
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,818
God knows if anyone
lives or not..

677
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,992
Murder and everything
else is forgiven.

678
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,153
The atmosphere of the
country is very good.

679
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,324
There is law and order,
everything is all right.

680
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,835
God knows if anyone
lives or not..

681
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,996
Murder and everything
else is forgiven.

682
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,105
What else should I say?

683
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:42,009
A small theft..
- And some bribe..

684
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:45,104
That has us existing..

685
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,242
Rest of it is all right
all due to you.

686
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,186
Everything is all right.

687
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,849
We are well.

688
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,280
The cost of the markets..

689
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,087
The cost of the markets..
- Yes!

690
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,095
The costs of the markets
are higher than my uncle.

691
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,893
The turban wearing fathers are
waiting in the apartments.

692
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:39,361
These elderly hungers are not
dead, they are alive as yet.

693
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:42,405
How can anyone fight
with these elders?

694
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,441
The costs of the markets
are higher than my uncle.

695
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,910
The turban wearing fathers are
waiting in the apartments.

696
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,376
These elderly hungers are not
dead, they are alive as yet.

697
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:55,247
How can anyone fight
with these elders?

698
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,319
What can I tell you?

699
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,513
There is some new
meeting everyday.

700
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,249
There is some new
speech every day.

701
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:03,383
There is no ration
for the speechs.

702
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,452
Everything is all right,
all due to you!

703
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,260
Everything is all right.

704
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,927
We are well.

705
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,443
The cycle of the circular
Roti went!

706
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,282
The cycle of the circular
Roti went!

707
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,294
The silver rupee
went behind it.

708
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:42,955
The roti was taken
by an eagle.

709
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,968
The silver was taken
by the black crow.

710
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:49,228
The cycle of the circular
Roti went!

711
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:52,298
The silver rupee
went behind it.

712
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,968
The eagle took the roti.

713
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,174
The silver was taken
by the black crow.

714
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,510
What else can I say?

715
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:03,985
Death is abundant. -
It has become a routine.

716
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,989
We don't have ways to live.

717
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:10,388
Everything is all
right due to you.

718
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,258
Everything is all right.

719
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:16,330
We are well.

720
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,164
We have done our BA.
- We have done our MA.

721
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,171
I think but why did
we even do that.

722
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:26,398
We don't have any work
here.. or else..

723
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,502
Everything is all right
here due to you.

724
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,037
Khatam..

725
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,037
Do you have moustaches
or ice cream?

726
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,378
Get lost from here. Ice cream!

727
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,050
Hey fatso..
- What did you say?

728
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:19,058
Give me ten paisa, please.

729
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,060
Do I have to repay your father?

730
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:28,403
Rascal.. wretch..
- Get lost..

731
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:43,076
Hey.. you? How is your sister?
What was her name?

732
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,420
Tini.. she cannot walk.

733
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,422
I am hungry since yesterday.
Give me ten paise.

734
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,620
What kind of parents
do you have?

735
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,094
They didn't give you anything
to eat since two days.

736
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,421
I don't have any parents.

737
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,094
Oh.. therefore..

738
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,101
Where do you reside?

739
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,106
I reside in that broken
down apartment.

740
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:08,108
Please give me ten paise,
I am hungry.

741
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,438
Oh god..

742
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:14,516
I had to see children
begging. Come on..

743
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,609
Let us see what is there
to eat at home.

744
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,111
Whose house?

745
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:23,519
Go.. take him with you. Give
him something to eat.

746
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,460
What will he do if not ask?
He doesn't have mother.

747
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:29,123
Father is in prison.
Who will feed him?

748
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,598
Why? The neighbors
can feed him..

749
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,637
It seems that you are new here.

750
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,529
Who has the time to look after
other people's sadness?

751
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,138
Brother.. in our times,
if someone..

752
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,145
..was hungry in the
whole locality..

753
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,147
..we would call them
and feed them.

754
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,315
We used to say that lord
Narayana has come home.

755
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,150
Here.. it seems..

756
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:54,816
Even if the tree gives fruits,
it will ask money first.

757
00:54:56,493 --> 00:55:00,554
Come on.. son.. come
on.. come on!

758
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,339
Aunty..
- Daughter-in-law..

759
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:14,342
Where did you see the
old woman? Aunty?

760
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,706
I had sent her here..
to buy the vegetables..

761
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,180
Hey.. who is this?

762
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,179
Aunty.. did you bring him?

763
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:29,186
Yes, he was hungry. I
brought him with me.

764
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,521
But who is he?

765
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:33,356
He is an orphan. He
begs in the streets.

766
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:36,193
Then why did you bring him
here? Is this some orphanage?

767
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,591
Daughter-in-law..

768
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,191
Come on.. get lost from here..

769
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,593
Daughter-in-law..
I have brought him along.

770
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,468
Whom did you ask before
bringing him here?

771
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,475
See, don't speak
like this to me.

772
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,204
I felt like, and l
brought him here.

773
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,212
Have we opened a
orphanage that..

774
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,216
..anyone will come and eat?
It takes money to eat.

775
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,750
Nothing has lessened
from your food.

776
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,811
I am feeding him
from my own food.

777
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,549
You didn't bring that
from the village.

778
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,215
You eat it from our earnings.

779
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,550
I don't eat it for free.
I do ten jobs for you..

780
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,891
..and only then do you
give me food to eat.

781
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:09,558
Wow.. you drank the city water..

782
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,829
..and you grew wings. You
became smart very soon.

783
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:16,631
Am I smart? It is
you who are smart.

784
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,641
You called me an aunt and
brought me here from the village.

785
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:23,736
To have your work done. Liars!

786
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,577
Shut up! You don't need
to speak so much.

787
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,241
This is my house. I will
do what I want to.

788
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,577
If you want to order around,
order in your village.

789
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,923
Come on.. come on from here.

790
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,653
One shouldn't even drink
water from such homes.

791
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:43,756
You unashamed fool. Had
come to buy a mother.

792
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,668
They had come to buy a mother.

793
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,262
Fie on such relations.

794
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:53,608
Will we loose our respect
and dignity for them?

795
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:59,613
Were we dead in the village?
Why did they come to get me?

796
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:02,446
Did I beg them to bring me here?

797
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:05,754
And they show me the
power of money.

798
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:09,280
Your uncle has left
so much money..

799
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,625
..I can have you people
sit and eat.

800
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,829
Oh god.. where should I go now?

801
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,631
Where should I go in
this strange land?

802
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:23,797
Come mother.. please
come to my house.

803
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:27,304
Was I anything less
in my own village?

804
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,308
It was all right if I was alone.

805
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,913
I wouldn't have to see the
faces of these strangers.

806
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,643
Don't you ever come here now,
live in my house.

807
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:53,861
You.. you..

808
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:57,930
Did you throw her out?
What did she do here?

809
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:02,335
She was a maid..

810
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,941
What was her salary?
- Salary..

811
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,617
Twenty rupees.

812
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:17,351
One pays salary for one week if
you sack anyone without notice.

813
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,689
Will you give me the salary, or
should I take the baton out?

814
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:36,036
Oh god.. what is this?

815
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,713
She is like this from
the beginning.

816
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,375
Did you eat anything?

817
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,656
No.. it pains. We
are very hungry.

818
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:52,557
God.. why do you give
pain to such children?

819
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:56,561
What can I do? I don't
have anything.

820
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,565
I had some change. That was
left in the box too. - Here.

821
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:07,409
Your box.. and this is your
salary for a month.

822
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:12,580
Salary? - I saw that you
left the house crying.

823
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,412
Therefore, I brought
your baggage.

824
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:19,754
They gave me salary?
- Yes, nobody refuses me.

825
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,419
I get whatever I ask.

826
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:27,887
They finished everything
by giving me money?

827
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,432
Was this my price?

828
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,959
Is there anything left?
What was your salary?

829
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:45,940
No.. nothing is left. I came
thinking that they were relatives.

830
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:50,979
They completed the deal
thinking that I was a servant.

831
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,797
Who are you, son?
What do you do?

832
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:05,857
I don't do anything.
I am jobless.

833
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:09,801
Where do you stay?
- In this locality.

834
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:14,637
Don't you ever go home? I see
you wandering all the time.

835
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:20,474
I go home, sometimes. Come on..

836
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,479
We will get something
from the market to eat.

837
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:27,487
Listen.. take this money.
Bring some pulses and rice.

838
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:29,488
I will make some 'Khichdi'
from Bittu.

839
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,885
Keep this with you.
They will be helpful.

840
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,828
I will bring the goods, grandma.

841
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:53,507
What did you say? The rice is
bad? You have great strength.

842
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:59,849
Sir, take whatever you get.
If the government hears it..

843
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:04,120
It will take this away too. Say
anything.. it is rice, isn't it?

844
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:05,919
Eat it..

845
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:08,691
there are days
of eating grams now..

846
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:13,735
Mr. Sharma.. give him 200 grams
pulses, some rice and oil.

847
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:15,864
Tell me, what is the cost?

848
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:19,806
How can I give him rice without
card in this world of ration?

849
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:22,071
Oh.. I am just asking
for 200 grams.

850
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,544
There are so many people
who don't take ration.

851
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:26,807
This is great. Does anyone
not take ration nowadays?

852
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:28,714
Yes. There are many who do that.

853
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,752
And that is what you
sell in black.

854
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:34,750
Don't try to act smart.
Do what I tell you.

855
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,951
Yes. Whatever you say so.. we
are living in your grace.

856
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:41,553
Give him this money.

857
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,892
Please have a seat, where
are you off too?

858
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,900
You wouldn't mind having
a cup of tea?

859
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:48,562
I don't have any problem
if you give it to me?

860
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:52,574
Have this chewing gum,
I like this very much.

861
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,173
It is the only thing that
doesn't exhaust..

862
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:55,972
..even if you keep
on chewing on it.

863
01:01:56,979 --> 01:02:01,109
Bantu.. get a cup of tea.
And more sugar for Shyam.

864
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:09,752
Yes, sir.. the elections are
arriving. What will happen?

865
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:11,588
What is to happen?

866
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:15,987
Both the parties are strong,
what if there is bloodshed?

867
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:21,593
Why are you worried? You
have to vote, just vote.

868
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:25,770
Who are you with? You are
the real rulers nowadays.

869
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:28,772
Who can sit on the chair of
power without your wishes?

870
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:30,869
You are trying to act
smart once more?

871
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:32,938
Sharma..

872
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:37,613
If Pandey comes, give him
a canister of kerosene.

873
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:38,949
Kerosene?

874
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,615
Kerosene, child.. kerosene..

875
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,090
If you don't understand..

876
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,024
..shall I se the shop afire
and make you understand?

877
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,686
What kerosene is..

878
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,830
No.. I understand. But
what I am saying is..

879
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:50,889
There is a control on kerosene
nowadays, isn't it?

880
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:52,624
And shall I give it
without permit?

881
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,966
What if I am jailed?

882
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,633
I will give the bail, Sharma.

883
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,031
And I will have you
shaved, Sharma.

884
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,635
Remember.. if the goods
of this locality..

885
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,647
..go anywhere else, you
will go to jail later..

886
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:08,707
..but before that, I will
have you lynched.

887
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,818
This is strange. Where
should I go now?

888
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:16,184
If both of you decide about it,
it will be good for me.

889
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:20,318
You worry about that. I am
leaving, get the goods.

890
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,992
Okay, brother.

891
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:25,657
There is just this one ration
shop between two places.

892
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:30,067
It is very difficult for me.
- Here is the tea.

893
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:32,665
Here, sir.. please
have this tea.

894
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,675
Did you see that, grandma?
She belches..

895
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:45,949
..so much even though
she is so small.

896
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:49,148
Did you eat well?
- Yes, I ate well.

897
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:52,217
Rambharose doesn't know
how to cook food at all.

898
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:54,024
Who is this Rambharose?

899
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,687
Our hotel owner.

900
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:59,025
Grandma, my grandma
made such food.

901
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:05,699
Okay.. go.. go to sleep
now. You speak a lot.

902
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,033
Come on.. whose deal is it?

903
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:08,701
Khabri.. it is your
deal come on..

904
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:10,709
Hey, it is a big hand.

905
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,982
Hey, you have to give me ten
paise of the other deal.

906
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,711
Hey, take it.. you
are so adamant..

907
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,719
What is it to be
adamant about it?

908
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:18,913
Here, take it..

909
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:21,718
Oh.. there are so many moons
in our garden today.

910
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,722
Please come, grandma..

911
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:28,060
Ten blind. Did you eat?

912
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:32,191
Why did you bring those
snacks and sweets for me?

913
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,066
I wondered whether you ate
with the children or not.

914
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:37,069
Babu and Tini are Brahmins.

915
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,901
Your customs won't be affected.

916
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,135
Come on..

917
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,939
You are very smart.

918
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:50,141
Hey.. what are you doing
with these boys?

919
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,744
Go.. go and go home.

920
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:58,285
Grandma.. he is a boy,
not a girl..

921
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,761
Oh.. what has happened
to my brains?

922
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,091
Come on.. play your game..

923
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,764
You have two wifes..

924
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,168
Grandma.. don't tell
the cards like this.

925
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,771
His play..
- Beloved.. don't lie to me..

926
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:23,948
Hey, grandma is playing too?
Friend, you are very bad.

927
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,247
You met her in the morning and
forgot her in the evening?

928
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:27,789
Will you not greet
her or anything?

929
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,288
Greetings, grandma..

930
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,786
Even we will play the cards.

931
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,123
Do you have the money?

932
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,391
Why do we need money
when one has cards?

933
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,259
Grandma, this is Flash..

934
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,304
..one cannot play it if
they don't have money.

935
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:47,334
Then this is gambling.

936
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:50,201
What else? We are gamblers.

937
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:51,803
I have lost it too.

938
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:54,142
Grandma, we are not good people.

939
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:55,808
The whole locality says
that we are wastrels.

940
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:58,818
We are called wastrels,
hooligans and thieves.

941
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:00,819
I have lost it too.

942
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:05,085
We are hooligans, but
not without conscience.

943
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:08,297
Till the time everything works
peacefully, we work.

944
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:11,822
If it doesn't, we do something,
something small.

945
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:13,999
What is a small matter?

946
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,101
You don't know what
this small is?

947
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:19,005
I will show you right away..
Shyam.. please deal.

948
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:31,852
Look at this, grandma. This
is known as a small matter.

949
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,012
Just throw one, and the
whole crowd disperses.

950
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:37,851
Oh.. this is a bomb!

951
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,862
Yes. Yes.. this is small,
homemade.

952
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,397
Therefore, it is
known as a small.

953
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:46,265
Keep it.. keep it.. children
don't play with these things.

954
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:49,133
You go to your Madrass
and study.

955
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,866
How are you related to all this?

956
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:52,868
We should study? Where?

957
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:57,871
Shyam.. don't you
go to the Madrass?

958
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:01,207
Enough..

959
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:03,880
Except Sarju, everyone goes
to the college, grandma.

960
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,483
But nobody studies.

961
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,883
How can we study?
In the colleges..

962
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:12,223
..too, there are less studies
and more politics.

963
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:15,887
Even colleges are the grounds
for politics now.

964
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:20,067
The colleges are closed there,
and we are jobless.

965
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:21,897
And our parents shout
at us in such a way..

966
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,905
..as if we don't want
to do anything.

967
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:27,070
If we sit at home,
they get angry.

968
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:29,906
And if we go out, they say that
the son has been wasted.

969
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,377
We go home just twice.
Like one..

970
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:35,246
..has to go to the police
station to present himself.

971
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:37,313
Who will listen to everything?

972
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,911
People call us thieves
and dacoits.

973
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:43,917
Okay, grandma.. tell me.. do
we seem to be dacoits to you?

974
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,262
Yes.. you do seem dacoits to me.

975
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,127
What? We seem dacoits?

976
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:56,466
Yes, dacoits are like you.
Handsome, smiling..

977
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:59,440
Grandma, have you
ever seen a dacoit?

978
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,937
Yes.. I have seen..

979
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:10,545
I had met them too. They
had come to our house.

980
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:17,950
Open the door.. - Patience..
I am coming.. patience..

981
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,955
Sir? So late in the night?

982
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:27,466
Don't ask me, Ranjanlal. A
dacoit has escaped from prison.

983
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:29,470
And he has come towards
his village directly.

984
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:33,307
But.. in my house..
is he related to me?

985
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:40,144
No.. Himmat Singh says that
he saw him coming here.

986
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:44,475
See.. you search here..
and you search here..

987
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,993
And see.. who is upstairs?

988
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,152
Upstairs? Just my wife.

989
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:58,324
Oh..

990
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,992
Did you keep your
eyes in the safe?

991
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,160
I was afraid inside.

992
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:04,338
Then is a marriage procession
standing outside?

993
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:05,998
Didn't you hear that a big
dacoit is roaming outside?

994
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:11,012
But the door was closed,
how did he come inside?

995
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,612
And the walls are
not that low too.

996
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,348
A person who has
escaped prison..

997
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:19,285
..do you think that these walls
will be a great deal for him?

998
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:24,290
Please come and look inside.
Maybe he is hiding below the bed.

999
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:28,524
No.. he isn't someone
hide beneath the cot.

1000
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:32,023
He will sit on the
bosom of a person.

1001
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:40,035
Anyway.. be careful. I will
go to inform my superiors.

1002
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:42,236
He will come and look
at it himself.

1003
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:44,040
This isn't my cup of tea.

1004
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:05,662
Oh god.. I almost died today.
Brother.. brother..

1005
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,065
Please come out..

1006
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:16,544
Thank you very much. I will
always be grateful to you.

1007
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,079
What are you saying? What have..

1008
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,081
..we done that you should
be grateful to us?

1009
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:23,341
Please give it to him.
- What is this?

1010
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:24,613
This is some food.

1011
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:26,484
Good. It will be useful.

1012
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:29,080
I haven't eaten anything
since yesterday.

1013
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:31,349
This police have been
chasing me like dogs.

1014
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:35,259
Brother, please eat something. I
will lay the food out quickly.

1015
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,490
No, sister. I don't
have time now.

1016
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,433
If I am alive, I will
come. When l..

1017
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:43,562
..will eat the food that you
have prepared, with you.

1018
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,630
You told him about life
without any reason.

1019
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,438
You have ruined my whole life.
If I hadn't married..

1020
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:52,606
..I would have joined
your party with you.

1021
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:55,445
You don't need to join
my party to work.

1022
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,577
You can do a lot by staying
in the house too.

1023
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:01,521
What are you saying, sir?
What can be done from home?

1024
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,457
Just what you did right now.
Was this something small?

1025
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:06,721
Come on.. I will leave you
outside the village.

1026
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,660
No, you please wait
here. It will..

1027
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:10,460
..be dangerous for you
to come with me.

1028
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:17,297
It will be better if I leave
from here in the night.

1029
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:05,345
The government said that
my brother was a dacoit.

1030
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:09,515
And the people called
him an lndian dacoit.

1031
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:14,790
He was a revolutionary.
He died for the country.

1032
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:21,261
They were so handsome..
Iike you.

1033
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:27,200
Simple.. with an attitude..
and rascally too!

1034
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:41,384
Come on, get up.. it is
too late in the night.

1035
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:01,776
Why, Shyam? You
will not go home?

1036
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:07,648
I stay here most of the time.
Babbu and Tini get scared alone.

1037
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:11,447
I am here now. You go home now.

1038
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,585
Your people must be
worrying about you.

1039
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:15,656
Nobody worries about
me, grandmother.

1040
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:18,727
Yes, you will say so and
I will believe it.

1041
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:22,252
Will we not worry if you
don't come here one day?

1042
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:26,594
Come on, grandma..

1043
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,863
..we will go to your village
with Babbu and Tini.

1044
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:33,266
Will you come with me?
Come on, son.

1045
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:38,806
I have a garden. It is enough.
It is useless for me alone.

1046
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:43,617
Come on.. our village is
better than this city.

1047
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:50,681
What is it? Why are you silent?

1048
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:56,795
No, grandma.. I will
have to live here.

1049
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,297
I will have to live
here till the end.

1050
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,507
I will have to fight,
I will have to survive.

1051
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,662
In the evening.. after office.

1052
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:33,326
Boat.. Boat club..

1053
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:39,334
Boat club..

1054
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:44,507
What an idiot? Can't you hear?

1055
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:47,340
Put hydrogen in your
ear. Hydrogen.

1056
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:56,850
Six.. six.. it is hot..
it is too hot!

1057
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:12,363
Raghu.. - Will you meet me?
Six in the evening?

1058
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:20,373
Raghu.. run.. Raghu.. run..
They have come..

1059
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:22,380
Catch them.. catch them..
catch them..!

1060
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:24,646
Catch him, don't
let him escape..

1061
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,903
You have much guts..
you run very well.

1062
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:54,414
Therefore he has come
sitting on a horse!

1063
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:58,576
Let us give water to the horse.
We will reap later.

1064
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:01,413
Do you forget that day already?

1065
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,421
Just because we left you?

1066
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:05,892
Your father must have left me!

1067
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:09,020
Let me see who saves you today.

1068
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:11,691
Come on, horse.. drink
the horse water!

1069
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:17,428
Careful. He is weak.. if you
apply undue pressure..

1070
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:20,942
..he will lose his life.

1071
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:25,446
Doesn't matter..

1072
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:29,450
This time.. if I don't have
you tied to a horse and run..

1073
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,452
Then you tell me.

1074
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:35,720
Leave him.. he has
started crying.

1075
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:38,450
Wash.. wash his face quickly.

1076
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,626
See, grandma is coming.

1077
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,461
Throw the fool into the water.

1078
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,736
You are saved because
of grandma today.

1079
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,815
What happened to you, son?

1080
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:08,481
Nothing..
- Did you fall down?

1081
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:10,486
Didn't I tell you, nothing?

1082
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:13,485
Do you have a sprain
in your leg?

1083
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:19,498
Or have you fought? Come on..
get up. Come with me.

1084
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:22,831
Come on..
- Very good.. very good..

1085
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:29,507
Come on..

1086
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,671
This will be all right
till tomorrow.

1087
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:38,676
This salve. It takes
all the pain away.

1088
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:41,912
My mother-in-law
told this to me.

1089
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,515
You tell your mother-in-law.

1090
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,863
One saree was helpful
to the son.

1091
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:52,530
Who will bring any more for me?

1092
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:07,943
This is Shyam's den, Chainu.

1093
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:15,548
Pandey, Danny, you stay here.

1094
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:23,727
Chainu.. Raghu's shirt.
He was wearing this.

1095
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:36,569
Chainu.. Billu.. and there
were two more too.

1096
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:40,042
Is he your friend? Come,
have a seat.

1097
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:41,582
Where is Shyam?

1098
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,184
See, child. These people
fight amongst themselves.

1099
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:47,978
You are elder to them. Why
don't you tell them?

1100
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:50,752
I don't know what they are
angry about on each other.

1101
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:53,588
They won't fight if
you convince them.

1102
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:55,195
Where is Shyam?

1103
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:57,593
He has gone to the
doctor with Bittu.

1104
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:59,930
When he comes, tell him
that Chainu had come.

1105
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,593
If he is so angry, let
him come and attack me.

1106
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:04,602
He can do whatever he wants to.

1107
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:06,937
But if he ever touches
any of my boys..

1108
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:10,102
..I will blast the whole
of the locality.

1109
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,679
Son.. don't say like this..

1110
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,808
I didn't do anything till now.
The day I do something..

1111
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:19,149
Oh god.. why do you speak
of increasing the fight?

1112
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:23,616
See, I am like your mother.
Even though..

1113
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:29,631
..you are my son, how will
I tolerate it if you fight?

1114
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,962
Come on..

1115
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:06,659
Don't walk a lot. Give
your leg some rest.

1116
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:20,673
Very good.. shall we go to the
tonga now? Come on.. Very good.

1117
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:24,281
Hey, hey mister.. I have
stopped this tonga.

1118
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,220
You go and search for
some other tonga.

1119
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:29,280
You speak very loudly, are
you new in this city?

1120
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:31,852
Then.. are you the sheriff
in this city?

1121
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,757
Whom are you..

1122
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:45,697
Come on.. have a seat.

1123
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:55,042
Come on..

1124
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:33,081
If only I had someone..

1125
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:37,022
Whom I could say was mine..

1126
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:43,759
If not near.. somewhere far..

1127
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:48,096
But someone mine..

1128
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:54,767
If only I had someone..

1129
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:58,779
Whom I could say was mine..

1130
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:05,110
If not near.. somewhere far..

1131
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:09,951
But someone mine..

1132
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:39,149
I wouldn't have slept
in my eyes.

1133
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:44,157
There would just be tears.

1134
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:50,357
We would have woken and
dreamt all night.

1135
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:56,226
I wouldn't have slept
in my eyes.

1136
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:01,174
There would just be tears.

1137
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:08,341
We would have woken and
dreamt all night.

1138
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:17,849
Someone would take my pain,
I would have someone..

1139
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:28,395
If only I had someone..

1140
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:33,874
Whom I could say was mine..

1141
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:39,073
If not near.. somewhere far..

1142
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:43,379
But someone mine..

1143
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:10,903
Some memories.. and some
forgotten promises.

1144
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:17,913
There is such loneliness
all night.

1145
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:29,927
Some memories.. and some
forgotten promises.

1146
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:35,932
There is such loneliness
all night.

1147
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:43,210
If there was some conviction
at least..

1148
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:47,442
If I would have someone
of my own..

1149
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:55,946
If only I had someone..

1150
01:24:56,024 --> 01:25:01,223
Whom I could say was mine..

1151
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:06,290
If not near.. somewhere far..

1152
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:10,303
But someone mine..

1153
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:16,241
If I would have someone
of my own..

1154
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:21,146
Whom I could say was mine..

1155
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:26,244
If not near.. somewhere far..

1156
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:30,985
But someone mine..

1157
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,626
Oh grandma.. you..

1158
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:41,566
Are we not yours? Is
a mother one's own..

1159
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:43,570
..only if she gives
birth to you?

1160
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:45,571
Grandma.. if I didn't think
you to be my own..

1161
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,905
..would I stop you from going
back to your village?

1162
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:51,575
Then.. what were you saying?

1163
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:53,577
I would have someone own..

1164
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:57,582
That is just a song. I wasn't
telling it to you.

1165
01:25:57,919 --> 01:25:59,910
Then, to whom were you saying?

1166
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,580
Is it some girl?

1167
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:15,767
It is someone, isn't it? Are
you hiding it from me? Tell me.

1168
01:26:18,005 --> 01:26:22,772
No, grandma. There is no one.

1169
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:27,113
There wasn't and there
will never be.

1170
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,141
And the one who was..

1171
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:32,948
Urmi.. if you don't
come tomorrow..

1172
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:34,146
..I will directly kidnap
you from college.

1173
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,884
Why don't you understand,
Shyam, how will I come?

1174
01:26:37,024 --> 01:26:39,083
Just like how you came
today, in a tonga.

1175
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,627
Or else, shall I bring for
a marriage procession?

1176
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:42,626
And what should I tell father?

1177
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:45,027
Tell him that I am going to
search for a son-in-law for you.

1178
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:47,624
Yes, keep joking. You'd
come to know how..

1179
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,637
..difficult it is to leave
home if you were a woman.

1180
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:53,797
I am scared of father,
and then brother..

1181
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:56,637
And then the smallest,
he is so smart.

1182
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:59,646
Who is afraid of them?
- Are you abusing my brothers?

1183
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:00,976
No.. I am not.. if
they are not my brother-in-laws..

1184
01:27:01,048 --> 01:27:02,140
..then they might become one.

1185
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:04,178
Okay I'll leave now.

1186
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:05,651
but you will come tomorrow,
isn't it? - Yes.

1187
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:08,917
Okay. Bye.
- Let's go.

1188
01:27:22,069 --> 01:27:24,663
Shyam.. on the road?

1189
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,001
Chainu! How are you?

1190
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:29,075
I am all right. Tell me, who
was she? What was her name?

1191
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:32,340
She lives in the next building.
She studies with me.

1192
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,846
You are having fun. Please
admit me in college too.

1193
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:40,078
Oh very well, get admitted.
A bell ringer is needed.

1194
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:42,679
So what? At least l
will get something!

1195
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:44,688
There is a program in the
valley tomorrow evening.

1196
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:45,885
Are you there?

1197
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,896
Tomorrow evening..
I am busy. Okay.

1198
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:52,693
I know what your work is..

1199
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:56,697
Shyam.. why are you
angry with me?

1200
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:59,233
I didn't tell father
to be transferred.

1201
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:04,768
When is he going?
- Next week.

1202
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:07,105
He was saying that it
is some emergency.

1203
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:09,046
Everyone?
- Yes.

1204
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:13,050
Shyam.. you will come, isn't it?

1205
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:16,055
Where, Lucknow?
- Why?

1206
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:20,050
What do you mean by why? Will
you not come to meet me?

1207
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:22,724
I will come.. surely,
I will come. As soon..

1208
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,731
..as the examinations
are done, l..

1209
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,733
..will look out for
some job, so that..

1210
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:29,736
..I can ask your father
for you in marriage.

1211
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:38,136
Shyam..

1212
01:28:39,146 --> 01:28:40,738
Will you forget me?

1213
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:42,746
You are talking as if in films.

1214
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:47,915
No, promise me.
- Okay, I promise.

1215
01:28:49,156 --> 01:28:52,091
And promise me one more thing.
- What?

1216
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:56,753
You.. you..
- What is it?

1217
01:28:57,164 --> 01:28:59,155
You will not talk to Susheela.

1218
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:03,162
But she is your best friend.

1219
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:09,106
Yes, she is my friend, but she
looks at you in that way.

1220
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:11,939
In that way? Which way? In love?

1221
01:29:12,179 --> 01:29:13,840
In the way that you look at me?

1222
01:29:14,181 --> 01:29:17,309
Didn't I tell you, you will not
talk to her after I leave?

1223
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:21,119
Okay, I won't.. mad girl.

1224
01:29:28,195 --> 01:29:31,790
Wow.. you are having
fun all alone?

1225
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:34,298
Chainu.. go away from here..

1226
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:35,801
This is the limit..
will you have such..

1227
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,997
..a beautiful dish all alone?
- Chainu!

1228
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:39,800
At least think about
your friends!

1229
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:42,135
Are these your friends?

1230
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:46,144
Yes, beloved. We are friends.
We share.

1231
01:29:46,213 --> 01:29:47,305
Chainu..

1232
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,351
You hit one friend for a girl?

1233
01:29:56,223 --> 01:30:00,990
Urmi.. Urmi.. Iisten to
me.. Iisten to me..

1234
01:30:08,235 --> 01:30:10,328
Forget it.. you get many
like these in the market.

1235
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,173
This is the limit, you
are hitting me..

1236
01:30:14,241 --> 01:30:16,175
You are hitting your
friend for a girl?

1237
01:30:19,246 --> 01:30:20,338
Shyam!

1238
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:04,007
Urmi.. Urmi..

1239
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:07,507
Urmi..
- Who?

1240
01:33:08,415 --> 01:33:12,283
Who are you? Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1241
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,511
Arjun.. catch him..

1242
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:17,013
Where are you running off to?

1243
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:19,286
Thief.. - I am not a thief.
- Who are you?

1244
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,555
Daddy, he is Shyam. He lives
in the nearby house.

1245
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:23,028
What is he doing here?

1246
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:25,028
He was knocking at
Urmila's room..

1247
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,030
You rascal..

1248
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:28,363
Catch him!

1249
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:33,036
You dog!

1250
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:42,206
Call the police! Call the
police! Give him to the police!

1251
01:33:46,453 --> 01:33:48,045
I was in prison
for fifteen days.

1252
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:52,055
But those fifteen
days were enough..

1253
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:57,325
..to ruin the rest of my life.
- And that girl?

1254
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:00,060
Did you ever meet her?

1255
01:34:00,467 --> 01:34:04,267
Yes, I met her. I went
to Lucknow to meet her.

1256
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:08,064
Her father was arranging
for her marriage.

1257
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:13,073
I gathered some guts and went
to ask her hand in marriage.

1258
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:15,481
He chucked me out of the house.

1259
01:34:16,584 --> 01:34:21,681
He said.. I will not give
my daughter to a wastrel.

1260
01:34:25,492 --> 01:34:28,586
I left my education and
looked out for a job.

1261
01:34:30,497 --> 01:34:32,431
Father stopped speaking to me.

1262
01:34:34,501 --> 01:34:38,494
Urmila was married
within no time.

1263
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:45,111
There.. Chainu made his
group to take revenge.

1264
01:34:46,513 --> 01:34:52,782
I made my group. People hated
me in the beginning.

1265
01:34:53,654 --> 01:34:59,456
They taunted me. But they
don't say anything now.

1266
01:35:01,662 --> 01:35:03,459
Nobody says anything now.

1267
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:11,627
Julie.. I don't like haste..
but I don't like being late too.

1268
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:16,307
Just fifteen minutes more..
my duty will be done.

1269
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:19,140
We will go together after that.
- Okay.

1270
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:26,547
Wait..

1271
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,417
Why? Is she telling no to drink?

1272
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:30,650
No. we will have a bet first.

1273
01:35:31,325 --> 01:35:33,486
Bet? What bet?

1274
01:35:34,662 --> 01:35:38,325
The one who drinks this whole
bottle in one gulp..

1275
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:41,629
I will give him a hundred
rupees. - Agreed!

1276
01:35:41,702 --> 01:35:43,693
Done.. - You will give
me the money? - Done.

1277
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:45,762
I will start.
- Cheers.

1278
01:35:52,579 --> 01:35:54,171
Forget it.

1279
01:35:55,516 --> 01:35:57,177
Let it be, start!

1280
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,191
He is drinking..

1281
01:36:10,597 --> 01:36:12,189
He will take the money,
he will take it.

1282
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:17,698
He will take it.. very
good.. very good.

1283
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:23,203
Let me try it.

1284
01:36:24,378 --> 01:36:26,539
Do it. - I will have
my hundred with me..

1285
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:30,543
Come on.. quickly..

1286
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:49,225
Slowly.. slowly..

1287
01:36:55,409 --> 01:36:57,240
Pandey.. slowly!

1288
01:36:58,579 --> 01:37:01,571
Hooray!

1289
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:06,246
If you'd drink it, l'd
give it to you too.

1290
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,254
Here, have fun.

1291
01:37:08,422 --> 01:37:11,653
I'll leave now. - Hey,
he gave two notes.. - Have fun.

1292
01:37:15,662 --> 01:37:19,257
Mr. Kapoor, stop writing and
take these two hundred rupees.

1293
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:22,527
My boys are sitting there. Let
them eat anything they want.

1294
01:37:22,603 --> 01:37:23,661
Very good.

1295
01:37:23,737 --> 01:37:25,261
From where did you
get so much money?

1296
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:27,270
Why? Do you want it?
- No.

1297
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:31,275
Then why did you ask? -
But the way you spend it around..

1298
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:33,609
I work hard, I don't steal..

1299
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:37,446
I don't know that..
do you work properly?

1300
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:40,453
You don't know me at all till now.

1301
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:44,614
I am not a common man. I am
a kingmaker in the city.

1302
01:37:47,628 --> 01:37:49,289
Have you heard about Anokhelal?

1303
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:52,627
He cannot sit in the parliament
without me.

1304
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,825
Then why don't you
sit there yourself?

1305
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:57,302
Yes darling, if a thumb
print could work..

1306
01:37:57,371 --> 01:38:01,705
..I would have sat in
the parliament today.

1307
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:07,307
But an education is
necessary for that.

1308
01:38:07,648 --> 01:38:09,639
And that is what I don't like..

1309
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:15,315
Now.. I like just
one thing.. money!

1310
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:17,914
And it is good that
one doesn't need..

1311
01:38:17,991 --> 01:38:20,653
..to study to recognize money.
They can be recognized by color.

1312
01:38:21,328 --> 01:38:23,319
Tens, hundred, thousands.

1313
01:38:24,598 --> 01:38:26,327
Why do you keep this
in your pockets?

1314
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:31,337
This is not for you. This is
for some of my educated enemies.

1315
01:38:31,505 --> 01:38:37,341
Shyam.. Shyam..
Govind has fever.

1316
01:38:37,511 --> 01:38:39,741
I will have to go, Govind
is my younger brother..

1317
01:38:39,813 --> 01:38:42,611
I'll have to leave grandma,
Govind is my younger brother.

1318
01:38:42,683 --> 01:38:45,880
Wait.. I will come too..
- You.. but?

1319
01:38:47,688 --> 01:38:48,746
Okay, come on..

1320
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:53,759
Don't worry. I will come to
look at him tomorrow morning.

1321
01:38:53,861 --> 01:38:55,351
You sit with him.

1322
01:38:58,765 --> 01:39:00,426
Hello, doctor.
- Hello.

1323
01:39:01,535 --> 01:39:02,695
Come, grandma..

1324
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:10,703
Brother, does he have
a high fever?

1325
01:39:11,778 --> 01:39:13,541
She is grandma, lives nearby..

1326
01:39:13,647 --> 01:39:15,376
Yes, the fever is high.

1327
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:18,384
What did the doctor say? -
He has given this medicine.

1328
01:39:19,786 --> 01:39:24,780
I think that he has flu. Bring
two raw mangoes in the morning.

1329
01:39:24,892 --> 01:39:27,793
I will prepare a concoction
and have him drink it.

1330
01:39:27,861 --> 01:39:28,919
The fever will subside.

1331
01:39:30,797 --> 01:39:33,891
Brother.. you go and rest.
We will sit here.

1332
01:39:34,735 --> 01:39:36,396
Yes, dad. Go and rest.

1333
01:39:50,817 --> 01:39:56,756
Don't worry. I have come.
The fever runs when I come.

1334
01:39:57,591 --> 01:40:01,425
Grandma.. Govind is very
intelligent in studies.

1335
01:40:01,595 --> 01:40:06,430
Unlike me..
- Yes.. he is a good son..

1336
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:11,897
Shyam..

1337
01:40:11,972 --> 01:40:13,769
You go and sleep too.

1338
01:40:13,941 --> 01:40:15,431
What are you saying, grandma?

1339
01:40:15,776 --> 01:40:19,439
How can l.. - Oh.. I am
habituated to wake up all nights.

1340
01:40:19,613 --> 01:40:22,605
Do the old people feel sleepy?
Go and sleep.

1341
01:40:22,849 --> 01:40:24,612
No, grandma.. I will sit here.

1342
01:40:25,852 --> 01:40:27,717
You don't listen to me, do you?

1343
01:40:27,955 --> 01:40:30,788
Go and rest for some time..
come later.

1344
01:40:30,857 --> 01:40:32,620
I will wake you up. Go..

1345
01:40:45,005 --> 01:40:51,137
Shyam.. I don't think I will
be able to work for long now.

1346
01:40:52,879 --> 01:40:55,473
I am tired if I walk
even two steps.

1347
01:40:57,884 --> 01:41:00,011
There is some problem
in the eyes too.

1348
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:03,980
They may fool me this time too.

1349
01:41:06,827 --> 01:41:11,662
If I could marry you, the
child would have support.

1350
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:17,836
But I couldn't do
anything for you.

1351
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,899
I couldn't keep anything
for you too.

1352
01:41:22,909 --> 01:41:26,504
When your mother left,
I tried a lot..

1353
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:32,519
..that you shouldn't
feel for a mother.

1354
01:41:33,854 --> 01:41:39,053
But I don't know.. what
was missing in me..

1355
01:41:40,861 --> 01:41:44,524
I couldn't make you
a proper human too.

1356
01:41:48,935 --> 01:41:50,869
The husk also gets grounded
along with the wheat.

1357
01:41:50,937 --> 01:41:53,531
This is an old matter.
Now, say that..

1358
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:56,701
..even small stones are
with wheat.

1359
01:41:57,144 --> 01:42:01,137
Brother Sharma.. give
me a SER of grams.

1360
01:42:01,615 --> 01:42:05,711
Talk about kilos, aunty. Kilo.
The 'ser' times are gone now.

1361
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:10,952
Its one and the same,
both measure the same.

1362
01:42:11,958 --> 01:42:16,895
Please give it to me quickly.
Shyam likes spicy grams.

1363
01:42:16,963 --> 01:42:21,730
For Shyam? Oh god.. hey.. give
me a kilo of grams quickly..

1364
01:42:24,971 --> 01:42:26,734
How much is it?

1365
01:42:26,907 --> 01:42:28,898
It is all right, let
it be, aunty..

1366
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:33,903
No.. I will not take
any debt with me.

1367
01:42:34,981 --> 01:42:36,915
I will repay everything here.

1368
01:42:38,985 --> 01:42:40,976
Okay.. give it to me..
give me the bag.

1369
01:42:45,092 --> 01:42:48,926
Oh.. I have brought
these spicy grams..

1370
01:42:48,995 --> 01:42:55,594
Oh.. I have brought
these spicy grams..

1371
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:58,604
What food! Wow! This
is great fun!

1372
01:42:58,772 --> 01:43:01,070
This will be great
with alcohol..

1373
01:43:01,141 --> 01:43:02,608
Silent.. grandma has arrived.

1374
01:43:02,776 --> 01:43:04,937
Come. Welcome.. grandma..
welcome..

1375
01:43:06,012 --> 01:43:10,073
Tell us, grandma, where
were you till today?

1376
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:12,618
Well, where were you till today?

1377
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:14,877
Why didn't all of you
take birth at my place?

1378
01:43:14,955 --> 01:43:16,616
Looking at your faces..

1379
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:19,625
..I feel as if I should
have had a hundred sons.

1380
01:43:19,693 --> 01:43:20,955
Those were the Kauravas!

1381
01:43:21,027 --> 01:43:23,791
Grandma, do you like Kauravas?

1382
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:25,626
But you don't like Pandavas?

1383
01:43:25,799 --> 01:43:29,030
You are the Kauravas
and Pandavas for me.

1384
01:43:29,636 --> 01:43:32,628
You are everything for us.

1385
01:43:33,039 --> 01:43:35,633
Grandma, makes nice food.

1386
01:43:35,976 --> 01:43:38,638
The spicy grams are very good.

1387
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:42,915
Grandma.. make mutton
for us one day.

1388
01:43:43,049 --> 01:43:46,041
Widows don't touch mutton..

1389
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:51,657
What is there in that?
Tell me what you like.

1390
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:54,992
I will make anything you say,
I will apologize to God.

1391
01:43:55,162 --> 01:43:57,187
He will forgive me anything
for my sons.

1392
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:02,834
Grandma is great.. - She is
the greatest in the world!

1393
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:07,669
If I can.. I will give my
grandma the Padamshree.

1394
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:10,842
First, you take me
to your houses.

1395
01:44:10,944 --> 01:44:12,673
Introduce me to your parents.

1396
01:44:13,013 --> 01:44:15,004
No, grandma.. please don't
come to my house.

1397
01:44:15,081 --> 01:44:17,140
My father's temper..

1398
01:44:17,217 --> 01:44:21,017
Is always so hot.. put
a thermometer.. damn!

1399
01:44:21,855 --> 01:44:26,690
And my mother is suspicious,
the whole world is a thief.

1400
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:31,026
This is our house here, and you
are the head of the family.

1401
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:33,029
You can come to my
anytime you wish.

1402
01:44:33,099 --> 01:44:34,293
I had told you..

1403
01:44:34,367 --> 01:44:37,029
I live on the railway platform.
I don't have parents.

1404
01:44:37,204 --> 01:44:39,229
I can introduce you to the
station master and ticket collector.

1405
01:44:41,107 --> 01:44:45,874
Do you really live there? Do
you really not have parents?

1406
01:44:46,112 --> 01:44:51,209
Not only me, there are many
boys like me to stay there.

1407
01:44:51,785 --> 01:44:53,184
And what work do you do?

1408
01:44:53,253 --> 01:44:55,050
We do whatever we get.

1409
01:44:56,122 --> 01:44:58,113
I used to sell combs
at the age of five.

1410
01:44:58,225 --> 01:45:00,056
I became a monkey man
at the age of ten.

1411
01:45:00,126 --> 01:45:01,184
Monkey man?

1412
01:45:01,261 --> 01:45:03,229
I befriended a person who
did shows with monkeys.

1413
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:04,888
I learnt this puppetry from him.

1414
01:45:06,132 --> 01:45:08,066
I learnt making bombs
at the age of fifteen.

1415
01:45:08,235 --> 01:45:09,725
Result, prison.

1416
01:45:09,903 --> 01:45:12,736
Release.. prison.. release..
prison..

1417
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:14,068
Shyam..

1418
01:45:14,908 --> 01:45:17,069
Who is it?
- Is Shyam here?

1419
01:45:17,911 --> 01:45:19,344
Mr. Bilakiprasad.

1420
01:45:21,147 --> 01:45:23,342
Come on.. we will see..

1421
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:26,742
Greetings, Mr. Bilakiprasad.
- This is Shyam..

1422
01:45:28,255 --> 01:45:31,281
Oh, I was so tired
searching for you.

1423
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:34,750
I asked your father,
he doesn't know.

1424
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:36,819
I asked your brother,
he doesn't know..

1425
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:38,761
We stay here in the evenings.

1426
01:45:38,932 --> 01:45:42,766
Is this something to stay?
This is a dungeon.

1427
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:47,769
Let me win the election this
time. I will make a club for you.

1428
01:45:47,941 --> 01:45:52,935
There will be a library there.
A stage. A place to play.

1429
01:45:53,113 --> 01:45:55,775
Forget it. All this is just
said. If you win once..

1430
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,282
You will forget everything.

1431
01:45:58,184 --> 01:46:00,778
Girdhari Prasad said something
like this the last time.

1432
01:46:01,054 --> 01:46:03,113
He told us that he will
tell the station..

1433
01:46:03,189 --> 01:46:05,180
..the police will never
meddle in your matters.

1434
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:06,782
What did he do?

1435
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,791
And did you see? When there
was a ruckus in the college..

1436
01:46:08,862 --> 01:46:11,797
..I was the first
one to be caught.

1437
01:46:11,865 --> 01:46:14,800
And when I took Girdhari
Pandey's name..

1438
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:18,133
..by god, you won't believe,
a common constable said..

1439
01:46:18,204 --> 01:46:20,798
Don't tell me about Girdhari.

1440
01:46:20,974 --> 01:46:24,205
Don't associate me
with that Girdhari.

1441
01:46:24,277 --> 01:46:25,801
I had lost in the
previous elections.

1442
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:27,810
Let me win in the elections.
Then..

1443
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:29,815
..if the inspector
doesn't help you..

1444
01:46:29,883 --> 01:46:32,818
..I will have him transferred
in seven days.

1445
01:46:33,219 --> 01:46:39,818
But the bird in the cage..
mine.. that should win!

1446
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:45,097
Like that.. Mr. Bilakiprasad..
Your symbol is very apt.

1447
01:46:45,165 --> 01:46:47,326
Take the bird and
put it in the cage!

1448
01:46:49,336 --> 01:46:51,827
That is the meaning of politics.

1449
01:46:52,105 --> 01:46:56,007
A bondage, a discipline..
a helplessness.

1450
01:46:56,242 --> 01:46:58,335
A bird in a cage!

1451
01:47:00,347 --> 01:47:06,377
Listen, Shyam.. then.. I will
arrange for a jeep for you.

1452
01:47:06,453 --> 01:47:08,853
The petrol will be
full at all times.

1453
01:47:08,922 --> 01:47:11,186
You move around with
the boxes of my cage.

1454
01:47:11,257 --> 01:47:13,851
No vote should change hands..

1455
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:15,861
..keep these five
hundred rupees now.

1456
01:47:16,029 --> 01:47:18,020
Ask me if you want more.

1457
01:47:18,264 --> 01:47:20,858
Don't worry. I will take all
the birds around here..

1458
01:47:20,934 --> 01:47:24,267
..and put it in your cage.

1459
01:47:24,371 --> 01:47:28,330
Do whatever you want to. But
do it in a peaceful manner.

1460
01:47:28,408 --> 01:47:30,876
I will never accept
non violence.

1461
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,879
Being non violent is
our national duty.

1462
01:47:34,047 --> 01:47:40,213
Do your duty, eat drink
and enjoy life.

1463
01:47:40,286 --> 01:47:42,413
But yes.. that Anokhelal's
Chainu..

1464
01:47:42,489 --> 01:47:45,890
The one who is against
me in the election.

1465
01:47:46,226 --> 01:47:48,888
If Anokhelal's Chainu comes
to take my votes..

1466
01:47:48,962 --> 01:47:53,160
..we will see about non violence
later. Take care of him first.

1467
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:54,291
Come on..

1468
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:03,068
Grandma.. grandma.. take these
five hundred rupees.

1469
01:48:04,077 --> 01:48:06,511
We have earned it. Take it..

1470
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:10,243
No.. I will not take
such money. - Why?

1471
01:48:10,417 --> 01:48:13,250
Why did he give so much
money? Who is he?

1472
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:17,914
He is standing in the
elections. We have to canvass for him.

1473
01:48:17,991 --> 01:48:20,118
What? - We have to speak about
him, spread the word..

1474
01:48:21,261 --> 01:48:25,095
Spread the word.. is he
some Sri Ramchandra?

1475
01:48:26,332 --> 01:48:28,266
He is the leader of
the modern world.

1476
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:34,099
What leaders! As the face,
so the words.

1477
01:48:35,108 --> 01:48:36,939
Are the leaders like these?

1478
01:48:38,278 --> 01:48:39,939
Whatever is written in this..

1479
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:42,948
..cycle tile and give
it to everyone.

1480
01:48:43,116 --> 01:48:45,949
Yes, sir. Cyclostyle..
- Are you teaching me English?

1481
01:48:46,019 --> 01:48:47,350
I know what is written..

1482
01:48:48,455 --> 01:48:51,219
Hey, brother.. read what
is written in Hindi..

1483
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:52,485
Sri Anokhelal..

1484
01:48:52,559 --> 01:48:54,493
See properly.. what is
written in English?

1485
01:48:55,128 --> 01:48:56,220
Anokhelal..

1486
01:48:56,296 --> 01:48:58,230
Where is the Sri before this?
Write that here.

1487
01:48:58,298 --> 01:49:00,289
See, this is lndia. If you
don't write Sri before the names..

1488
01:49:00,366 --> 01:49:02,630
..one will never
earn any respect.

1489
01:49:03,303 --> 01:49:06,966
Chainu.. 'canvance' people to
vote for me in this election.

1490
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,370
Not 'canvance', convincing..

1491
01:49:09,442 --> 01:49:12,036
Yes.. do whatever he does..

1492
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:14,978
But in such a way.. that
is should be fun..

1493
01:49:15,048 --> 01:49:19,451
The problem is.. the people
don't sympathize with me.

1494
01:49:19,519 --> 01:49:21,248
How will they sympathize
with you?

1495
01:49:21,321 --> 01:49:23,983
Once you win the elections,
you forget them.

1496
01:49:24,057 --> 01:49:28,323
I am not like that. I does
not belong to that party.

1497
01:49:28,394 --> 01:49:30,988
Sir.. not does not.. do not..

1498
01:49:31,064 --> 01:49:34,329
I know English. But the
whole thing is that..

1499
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,267
The force of does..
doesn't exist in do.

1500
01:49:37,337 --> 01:49:42,001
Listen, Chainu.. see.. you went
to the prison so many times.

1501
01:49:42,075 --> 01:49:43,542
You went to the court
so many times..

1502
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:45,339
Didn't I save you?
- That is just it, sir..

1503
01:49:45,411 --> 01:49:47,402
I am ready to give my life
for you even today.

1504
01:49:47,514 --> 01:49:51,006
That is the fun. That
is called tit for tat.

1505
01:49:51,284 --> 01:49:54,014
You do something for us, we
will do something for you.

1506
01:49:54,187 --> 01:49:56,417
But the problem is,
why doesn't..

1507
01:49:56,489 --> 01:49:59,481
..the public sympathize with me?

1508
01:49:59,559 --> 01:50:02,027
See, whether they
sympathize or not..

1509
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:04,427
They will vote for you, even if
we have to hit them for that!

1510
01:50:04,497 --> 01:50:07,489
No. I don't believe
in non violence..

1511
01:50:07,567 --> 01:50:11,025
See.. I am against non violence.

1512
01:50:11,371 --> 01:50:14,033
You make me good in the
eyes of the people.

1513
01:50:14,207 --> 01:50:18,507
You raise me in their eyes.
And give me such respect..

1514
01:50:18,578 --> 01:50:22,036
That I should win
the election! - Sure.

1515
01:50:22,215 --> 01:50:24,376
But now even people
have started thinking.

1516
01:50:24,584 --> 01:50:26,211
What will this people..

1517
01:50:28,454 --> 01:50:31,514
What did you say? People
have started thinking?

1518
01:50:32,225 --> 01:50:35,058
Hey baldy.. hey.. Iisten..
stop this piano.

1519
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:37,062
Didn't you hear? The people
have started thinking..

1520
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:39,391
What does the people
be thinking?

1521
01:50:40,466 --> 01:50:43,458
Chainu.. don't let
these people think.

1522
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:47,062
If the people think..
I will have to think.

1523
01:50:47,407 --> 01:50:52,470
The whole thing is that..
if you read history..

1524
01:50:52,545 --> 01:50:56,072
No.. you haven't read English..
if you read history..

1525
01:50:56,149 --> 01:51:00,085
..you will find out, who
removed these kings.

1526
01:51:00,253 --> 01:51:02,551
These kings were moved
by the landlords.

1527
01:51:02,622 --> 01:51:05,090
And who moved these landlords?
- His tenants.

1528
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:08,093
And who removed these tenants
we have moved them!

1529
01:51:08,161 --> 01:51:11,426
The leaders have moved them..

1530
01:51:11,497 --> 01:51:15,490
But did you see? The people
are where they were.

1531
01:51:15,568 --> 01:51:17,502
That is right.
- Now you tell me..

1532
01:51:17,604 --> 01:51:19,629
Who will move us?
Who will move us?

1533
01:51:19,706 --> 01:51:22,368
I don't understand what
you are saying, sir..

1534
01:51:22,508 --> 01:51:24,373
You don't need to understand.

1535
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:29,106
If you work without thinking,
there is contentment and peace.

1536
01:51:29,182 --> 01:51:31,116
The whole thing is that..

1537
01:51:31,184 --> 01:51:33,584
I was telling you..
for that work..

1538
01:51:33,653 --> 01:51:36,121
There is a person from
our opposition party..

1539
01:51:36,189 --> 01:51:37,520
What is his name?
- Shyam.

1540
01:51:37,624 --> 01:51:41,458
Yes.. he is trying to
garner your votes.

1541
01:51:42,295 --> 01:51:45,458
If there is some danger
like this..

1542
01:51:45,531 --> 01:51:47,396
The whole thing is that..

1543
01:51:48,301 --> 01:51:50,531
We will see this non
violence later.

1544
01:51:51,537 --> 01:51:53,129
Teach him a lesson first.

1545
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:03,142
Brothers and sisters..

1546
01:52:06,486 --> 01:52:07,680
Brothers and sisters..

1547
01:52:08,488 --> 01:52:10,319
The country is in
a bad state today.

1548
01:52:10,556 --> 01:52:14,151
Today, we don't have Panditji
in our midst.

1549
01:52:14,327 --> 01:52:17,160
We don't have Netaji,
and Gandhi-ji.

1550
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:20,165
And I keep unwell.

1551
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:25,159
But.. serving lndia is our duty.

1552
01:52:25,338 --> 01:52:30,571
Serving lndia, whose culture,
history is great.

1553
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:35,170
But all those talents have
been lost to this world.

1554
01:52:35,448 --> 01:52:39,179
Brothers.. to make all those
talents stronger..

1555
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:43,188
..I have come arrived.
Therefore..

1556
01:52:43,256 --> 01:52:47,192
..to serve all my farmer
friends, to..

1557
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:50,195
..serve all my rich
businessmen..

1558
01:52:50,263 --> 01:52:53,460
..and to serve my sisters
and mothers.. I have come..

1559
01:52:53,533 --> 01:52:56,195
By serving and sacrificing
my life..

1560
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:59,466
..by giving all that I have..

1561
01:53:08,548 --> 01:53:14,214
By sacrificing my self, giving
everything I have..

1562
01:53:18,558 --> 01:53:19,616
Shyam..

1563
01:53:21,394 --> 01:53:22,554
Babu.. get lost.

1564
01:53:27,633 --> 01:53:29,624
What are you doing? You
are boring the people.

1565
01:53:29,736 --> 01:53:31,226
Garner some excitement!

1566
01:53:31,571 --> 01:53:33,630
Didn't I tell you those
dialogues? Say those.

1567
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,709
They are in Urdu.
- So what? They will work.

1568
01:53:38,644 --> 01:53:44,514
Today, there is a storm at
the boundaries of lndia.

1569
01:53:45,418 --> 01:53:49,787
Dangerous snakes are at the
boundaries, to sting us.

1570
01:53:49,856 --> 01:53:53,257
We will have to challenge
those blood hungry wolves!

1571
01:53:53,426 --> 01:53:57,590
But we don't have weapons,
we have guns, so what!

1572
01:53:57,663 --> 01:54:03,431
Our strong hands are enough
to rip them apart!

1573
01:54:06,606 --> 01:54:08,597
Hail Bilakiprasad!

1574
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:13,608
Hail Bilakiprasad!

1575
01:54:19,786 --> 01:54:21,276
Friends..

1576
01:54:22,688 --> 01:54:26,749
I am telling you
about 1842.

1577
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:31,692
19..
- Yes, 19, not 18.

1578
01:54:31,798 --> 01:54:34,289
The rage of freedom
had ignited..

1579
01:54:34,367 --> 01:54:37,825
..the country from the
Himalayas to Jhumritalaya.

1580
01:54:37,904 --> 01:54:39,895
Not Jhumritalaya, Kanyakumari.

1581
01:54:39,972 --> 01:54:41,837
Yes, Kanyakumari.

1582
01:54:42,708 --> 01:54:46,303
In excitement, in that
fire, I forgot..

1583
01:54:46,379 --> 01:54:50,645
..my wife, children and house
and jumped into the fire.

1584
01:54:50,917 --> 01:54:53,317
In those days.. the great
leaders of the..

1585
01:54:53,386 --> 01:54:55,911
..country were in
prison with me.

1586
01:54:56,589 --> 01:54:58,648
There, the leaders
showed unity too.

1587
01:54:58,825 --> 01:55:02,488
They showed unity and took on
the tortures of the British.

1588
01:55:02,595 --> 01:55:04,722
The whole thing is that..

1589
01:55:04,831 --> 01:55:08,733
Not only the British, they took
on the tortures of the bugs too.

1590
01:55:10,736 --> 01:55:16,606
Tortures of the bugs.. torture..

1591
01:55:16,676 --> 01:55:21,670
They took them on.. yes..
took them on..

1592
01:55:21,747 --> 01:55:25,342
I will tell you.. yes.. and
then we got the freedom one day.

1593
01:55:25,418 --> 01:55:28,615
And we have given that freedom
to you. We, the leaders!

1594
01:55:28,688 --> 01:55:30,349
To the people!

1595
01:55:30,423 --> 01:55:33,358
Brothers, the people's
work is done.

1596
01:55:33,526 --> 01:55:39,362
But the whole thing is that..
our work was not done.

1597
01:55:39,532 --> 01:55:42,365
I swear to god! Till the time
our work isn't done..

1598
01:55:42,435 --> 01:55:46,531
..we will never leave
this chair of power..

1599
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:48,700
Because..

1600
01:55:48,774 --> 01:55:50,571
The country needs us even today.

1601
01:55:50,776 --> 01:55:54,371
There are many moles in
the country even today..

1602
01:55:54,547 --> 01:55:55,912
Not moles, problems..

1603
01:55:55,982 --> 01:55:59,713
Yes, that's right.. problems..

1604
01:55:59,785 --> 01:56:01,844
There is no peace
in the country.

1605
01:56:01,921 --> 01:56:03,388
Peace..

1606
01:56:03,656 --> 01:56:08,389
I am not talking about some
wife or some servant woman..

1607
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:12,397
There is no peace
in this country.

1608
01:56:12,565 --> 01:56:14,726
Where was l?

1609
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,893
There is no peace, there
isn't anything!

1610
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:21,401
Friends, I will not waste
much of your time.

1611
01:56:21,807 --> 01:56:27,404
I will just tell the
youth of my country..

1612
01:56:28,748 --> 01:56:31,683
Wander.. wander..

1613
01:56:33,819 --> 01:56:37,414
The caravan shouldn't wander
in the darkness..

1614
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:40,425
..Iook at the bank, it is
there, where should we see now?

1615
01:56:42,762 --> 01:56:43,956
You didn't understand?
You didn't understand?

1616
01:56:44,030 --> 01:56:45,759
Nobody understood!

1617
01:56:48,834 --> 01:56:50,893
Hail Anokhelal!

1618
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:53,768
Hail Anokhelal!

1619
01:56:54,607 --> 01:56:59,442
Silent.. silent.. don't hail
me, hail the people..

1620
01:56:59,512 --> 01:57:01,639
Only then will I get
this chair of power..

1621
01:57:01,714 --> 01:57:07,050
Hail to the people..
hail to the people!

1622
01:57:08,854 --> 01:57:10,446
Vote for.. Bilakiprasad!

1623
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:12,457
Vote for.. Bilakiprasad!

1624
01:57:12,525 --> 01:57:17,622
Vote for.. Bilakiprasad!

1625
01:57:18,631 --> 01:57:20,462
This is very bad.

1626
01:57:20,533 --> 01:57:22,728
Very few people died in
the last five year plan.

1627
01:57:23,803 --> 01:57:25,737
This is the list of
all the dead people.

1628
01:57:25,805 --> 01:57:29,002
List. - Yes.. the
dead people have died.

1629
01:57:29,075 --> 01:57:31,873
But their ration cards
are still alive.

1630
01:57:31,978 --> 01:57:33,809
And we should get their votes.

1631
01:57:33,980 --> 01:57:36,471
Wow.. can anyone defeat you?

1632
01:57:36,749 --> 01:57:38,683
You have started putting
life into dead people..

1633
01:57:38,751 --> 01:57:41,879
Say slowly.. that
opposite cage..

1634
01:57:41,954 --> 01:57:43,751
..shouldn't listen to us
and do as we are doing.

1635
01:57:44,657 --> 01:57:46,022
Here is the list..

1636
01:57:46,092 --> 01:57:48,959
The children have become adults.

1637
01:57:49,028 --> 01:57:51,496
We should get those votes too.

1638
01:57:51,564 --> 01:57:52,826
And listen.

1639
01:57:52,999 --> 01:57:54,489
Go to every house
and spread my name.

1640
01:57:54,667 --> 01:57:56,897
Just make me win in this
election, that's it!

1641
01:57:57,003 --> 01:57:59,494
Give me five hundred
rupees more.

1642
01:57:59,672 --> 01:58:03,506
The whole thing is that..
it is so expensive..

1643
01:58:03,676 --> 01:58:06,042
I will stand in the elections
five years later.

1644
01:58:06,112 --> 01:58:07,511
There will be a expense
once again..

1645
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:08,706
Five hundred rupees..

1646
01:58:08,781 --> 01:58:10,510
Go and take five hundred
rupees from Damodar.

1647
01:58:10,683 --> 01:58:12,776
Okay?
- Okay..

1648
01:58:12,918 --> 01:58:15,853
Some loss has to be taken
for more profit.

1649
01:58:17,857 --> 01:58:19,518
Who is it? Why are you knocking?

1650
01:58:19,592 --> 01:58:20,854
Sir.. the poster..

1651
01:58:20,926 --> 01:58:24,054
Poster.. wow.. very good.

1652
01:58:25,931 --> 01:58:27,523
For the first time..

1653
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:29,864
..people will see a Technicolor
poster in election.

1654
01:58:30,936 --> 01:58:34,531
Vote for.. Bilakiprasad..

1655
01:58:34,707 --> 01:58:37,938
Vote for.. Bilakiprasad..

1656
01:58:38,878 --> 01:58:40,869
Vote for.. Anokhelal!

1657
01:58:40,946 --> 01:58:44,541
Vote for.. Anokhelal!
- Vote for.. Bilakiprasad..

1658
01:59:45,144 --> 01:59:52,607
Vote for.. Anokhelal!
- Vote for.. Bilakiprasad..

1659
01:59:53,619 --> 01:59:59,683
Vote for.. Bilakiprasad..

1660
01:59:59,759 --> 02:00:01,624
Vote for.. Bilakiprasad..

1661
02:00:03,796 --> 02:00:05,627
I'll be back..

1662
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:12,164
Doctor..
- Yes?

1663
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:14,900
Did you go to see father?
- No. - Why?

1664
02:00:14,974 --> 02:00:16,805
He doesn't want to have
himself treated.

1665
02:00:16,976 --> 02:00:19,103
He doesn't want to have
himself treated?

1666
02:00:19,178 --> 02:00:21,976
He has kept the remaining
money for his children.

1667
02:00:22,148 --> 02:00:24,309
He doesn't want to spend
money on himself.

1668
02:00:25,918 --> 02:00:28,648
Oh.. here.. whatever medicines
are needed..

1669
02:00:28,721 --> 02:00:31,815
..please buy them
from this money.

1670
02:00:31,924 --> 02:00:33,983
Since I know your father..
he will not..

1671
02:00:34,059 --> 02:00:36,857
..cure himself with
this money of yours.

1672
02:00:37,997 --> 02:00:40,830
Doctor.. you don't need
to tell him anything.

1673
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,991
You just cure him.

1674
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:47,937
It is possible..
- You can't just..

1675
02:00:48,007 --> 02:00:50,202
Shyam.. Shyam..
- Oh.. grandma..

1676
02:00:51,744 --> 02:00:53,678
Where are you people?

1677
02:00:53,746 --> 02:00:56,840
How are you?
- Vote for.. grandma..

1678
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:58,679
Why don't I see you any longer?

1679
02:00:58,751 --> 02:01:00,013
Grandma.. the elections
are round the corner.

1680
02:01:00,085 --> 02:01:02,679
We are very busy in that.
- Okay, listen..

1681
02:01:02,855 --> 02:01:07,849
Admit him in some Madrass.
His habits are rotten!

1682
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:09,860
He keeps begging all the time..

1683
02:01:09,962 --> 02:01:12,226
have some patience. I will
arrange everything.

1684
02:01:13,165 --> 02:01:17,101
I have an idea. You people
don't have time.

1685
02:01:17,203 --> 02:01:19,967
I will take Babu and Tini
and return to my village.

1686
02:01:22,107 --> 02:01:24,701
You remember your village,
isn't it, grandma?

1687
02:01:25,044 --> 02:01:32,712
Yes, son.. it seems.. that my
house and garden is calling me.

1688
02:01:33,118 --> 02:01:36,713
I have an idea, grandma. The
elections are day after tomorrow..

1689
02:01:36,789 --> 02:01:39,053
Wait till then, I will
come with you too.

1690
02:01:40,125 --> 02:01:46,064
Really? You will come too?
Don't change your word this time.

1691
02:01:46,131 --> 02:01:49,726
No, grandma.. I will come.
- All of us will go.

1692
02:01:49,902 --> 02:01:52,132
Let us see what fun we
have in the village.

1693
02:01:52,204 --> 02:01:53,899
What do you say, boys?

1694
02:01:54,073 --> 02:01:55,802
Okay, we will leave now.
We have some work.

1695
02:01:55,908 --> 02:01:57,239
Yes..
- Come on..

1696
02:01:57,910 --> 02:01:59,741
Okay, grandma..

1697
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:03,742
Vote for.. Bilakiprasad..

1698
02:02:03,916 --> 02:02:07,750
Vote for.. Bilakiprasad..
Vote for.. Bilakiprasad..

1699
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:10,753
Vote for.. Anokhelal..
Vote for.. Anokhelal..

1700
02:02:10,823 --> 02:02:13,758
Vote for.. Anokhelal..
- Mr. Sharma..

1701
02:02:16,929 --> 02:02:18,920
Come.. come Mr. Chainulal.

1702
02:02:19,098 --> 02:02:21,293
You are looking very nice today.

1703
02:02:21,934 --> 02:02:24,266
How many boats do you have?
- Three.

1704
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:26,167
You have three boats, isn't it?
- Yes.

1705
02:02:26,372 --> 02:02:29,773
Yes.. I have an idea.
Reach the office..

1706
02:02:29,842 --> 02:02:32,242
..day after tomorrow at seven
in the morning. For boating.

1707
02:02:32,311 --> 02:02:33,369
I will take you with me.

1708
02:02:33,445 --> 02:02:35,777
Please be clear, what
do you people want?

1709
02:02:35,948 --> 02:02:38,314
What is the meaning of
forcing me like this?

1710
02:02:38,951 --> 02:02:42,114
Force? Who is forcing me?

1711
02:02:42,187 --> 02:02:44,781
You are forcing me, who else?

1712
02:02:45,057 --> 02:02:47,787
Shyam had come some time back.
He threatened me.

1713
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:49,789
If the vote goes in
Chainu's box..

1714
02:02:49,862 --> 02:02:51,796
..I will have your shop
dismantled from here.

1715
02:02:51,864 --> 02:02:57,131
What is the need for all this?
Do we not know whom to vote for?

1716
02:02:59,204 --> 02:03:01,798
It seems that I will have to
arrange for you right now.

1717
02:03:02,341 --> 02:03:05,333
Raghu.. close his shop down..

1718
02:03:05,411 --> 02:03:07,470
What do you mean.. close down..

1719
02:03:07,546 --> 02:03:08,808
I mean..

1720
02:03:08,881 --> 02:03:11,816
Your shop will be closed and
you will come with us.

1721
02:03:12,151 --> 02:03:14,813
Open your shop after you vote
day after tomorrow, understood?

1722
02:03:15,154 --> 02:03:17,315
Come on.. come on..

1723
02:03:18,223 --> 02:03:20,987
Come on.. as if I go
just because you say.

1724
02:03:21,093 --> 02:03:23,425
Yes.. you will come just
because I say so.

1725
02:03:24,997 --> 02:03:26,988
If you have the guts..

1726
02:03:27,099 --> 02:03:29,897
Sharma.. I have heard that you
have a young daughter too?

1727
02:03:30,102 --> 02:03:34,004
Go and inform the police if you
don't worry about her, okay?

1728
02:03:35,007 --> 02:03:37,168
Sit inside. Come on!

1729
02:03:55,361 --> 02:03:58,387
Shyam.. that Sharma..
from the ration shop..

1730
02:03:58,464 --> 02:04:00,864
Chainu's men have picked
him up, for votes!

1731
02:04:01,033 --> 02:04:02,864
They have forced him
into the jeep!

1732
02:04:03,869 --> 02:04:05,860
Come with me..

1733
02:04:49,248 --> 02:04:51,910
Grandma.. grandma.. Shyam..

1734
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:53,383
What happened to him?

1735
02:04:53,452 --> 02:04:57,513
He has gone with
batons and axes.

1736
02:04:57,589 --> 02:04:59,921
Many boys have gone with him..

1737
02:05:00,092 --> 02:05:01,923
Come on.. come on..

1738
02:05:01,994 --> 02:05:04,929
They will not listen
to me.. come on..

1739
02:05:38,363 --> 02:05:41,958
Rambharose.. please
come with me..

1740
02:05:42,134 --> 02:05:44,034
My children are stuck
in the riots.

1741
02:05:44,136 --> 02:05:45,569
Please come and stop them.

1742
02:05:45,637 --> 02:05:50,472
No, aunty.. who will go in
their riots and lose their lives?

1743
02:05:50,576 --> 02:05:54,307
What is new in this? They will
hit themselves and cool down.

1744
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:58,246
What kind of men are you?
Don't you have a heart?

1745
02:05:59,384 --> 02:06:02,444
The children will fight and
die, and you will just stare?

1746
02:06:02,521 --> 02:06:04,386
Nobody will stop my sons?

1747
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:10,051
Oh..

1748
02:09:53,552 --> 02:09:55,816
Wait.. wait..

1749
02:10:16,641 --> 02:10:18,233
Grandma..

1750
02:10:30,655 --> 02:10:33,249
Grandma..

1751
02:10:33,425 --> 02:10:35,450
Grandma..

1752
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:38,254
Grandma..

1753
02:10:40,665 --> 02:10:43,600
Grandma..

1754
02:10:43,769 --> 02:10:49,264
Grandma..

1755
02:11:00,685 --> 02:11:04,280
Since some days, I feel.. as
if my house.. my garden..

1756
02:11:04,356 --> 02:11:06,620
Is calling me.

1757
02:11:07,626 --> 02:11:11,619
Come.. our village is
better than this city.

1758
02:11:13,698 --> 02:11:16,292
What is the matter,
why are you silent?

1759
02:11:31,716 --> 02:11:36,915
Let me go.. Iet me go..
- Come on..

1760
02:11:37,656 --> 02:11:42,320
Grandma.. grandma..

1761
02:12:38,383 --> 02:12:40,544
She is dead. Bring
the stretcher.

1762
02:12:46,791 --> 02:12:48,383
Being the sons of one mother..

1763
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:51,725
How will I tolerate it
if you fight like this?
