1
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,833
He is an IAS officer now!

2
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,708
IAS! That calls for a party!

3
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:39,083
Hail Lord Hanuman

4
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,625
Hail Lord Hanuman

5
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,375
Shower your blessings on me

6
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:50,375
Shower your blessings on me

7
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:54,500
Those who pray to you on Saturdays

8
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,625
Are truly blessed...

9
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,375
-Dad! Greetings!
-Bless you.

10
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,916
My dear son!

11
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,375
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

12
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,416
Please sit down.

13
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,250
How's your health?

14
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,250
I'm perfectly fine.
There's nothing wrong with me.

15
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,625
Take this.

16
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,291
Lord Hanuman promised me today.

17
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:43,666
You will surely become a collector.

18
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,083
Oh, yes! I almost forgot.

19
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,583
Gangaram brought this for you
from Pashupatinath.

20
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,916
Lord Bholanath's offering.

21
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,666
Wear it.

22
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,916
Dad, I think you're
skipping your medicines.

23
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:08,208
Why? What's wrong?
I'm perfectly fine.

24
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,083
This isn't because of thyroid.

25
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:16,583
I am just happy about the fact that...

26
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,583
you will become a collector
very soon

27
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:25,500
and I will be able to salute
in front of you.

28
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,333
No, Dad.

29
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,125
-You're the one who deserves salutations.
-My dear son!

30
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:44,125
Son, it's time for the boss to arrive.
See you soon.

31
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,458
Let me stay with you, Dad.

32
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,958
With me around, you'll be looked after.

33
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,833
I can study...

34
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,250
Dad, I can study there.

35
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,875
No, son.
Certainly not!

36
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,375
You have no idea.

37
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,833
If you tag along with me,

38
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,750
the snarls of poverty will entangle you.

39
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,833
And I don't want that to happen.

40
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,500
My son is born to rule!

41
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,875
Rule!

42
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,625
Bless you.

43
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,750
-Dad!
-Sanjay.

44
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,250
-Greetings.
-Bless you.

45
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,791
-Hey!
-Greetings, Uncle.

46
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,666
How are you, my dear?
Did you get your visa?

47
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,000
No, Uncle. I will get it soon.

48
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,416
Of course, you will.

49
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,125
Hello.

50
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,125
Arjun!

51
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,708
That's bad.

52
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,833
Hello, sir.

53
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,916
COLLECTOR, LUCKNOW

54
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:13,166
The exam papers have been getting leaked
for the past two years.

55
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,000
That has earned our university
a bad reputation.

56
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:22,125
The executive council of the university
has decided to form a new committee.

57
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:26,666
Thakur Tejpratap Singh will be
in charge of the committee.

58
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,166
Thank you.

59
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,750
I thank all of you...

60
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,916
for bestowing your trust in me.

61
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,208
But, I have a request.

62
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:49,541
This decision
should be deliberated upon...

63
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:55,083
because my style of work...

64
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:59,583
isn't tolerable to anyone,
except my wife.

65
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,333
We know that, Mr. Thakur.

66
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,125
You will handle this your way.

67
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,458
Don't worry.

68
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,500
The members of this executive council
will support you.

69
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,166
Make sure the papers don't get leaked
this time.

70
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,125
But, sir, there's no report
from the inquiry commission.

71
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,500
-Dissolving the exiting committee--
-Mr. Tiwari.

72
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,750
I care about this university's reputation

73
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,875
more than your honor.

74
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,208
Am I late?

75
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,416
By half an hour.

76
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,541
Did you get the notes?

77
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,250
-Yes.
-Come on.

78
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:50,083
Professor Sharma always extends
the lecture by half an hour.

79
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,375
Here you go.
Notes from Professor Sharma's class.

80
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,916
May I say something?

81
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,125
Why don't you join the class?

82
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,833
Professor Sharma's lectures

83
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,500
are beyond me.

84
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,625
It will be great help if you join me.

85
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,833
What if I pay your fees?

86
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,458
Do you want to buy me?

87
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,625
Yes, I do.

88
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,416
I want to buy you entirely.

89
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,000
Every moment of yours!

90
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,875
Every breath you take!

91
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,875
I want all of you!

92
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,291
Manjiri, you expect a lot from me.

93
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,375
But I have only one aim in life.

94
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,708
I want to fulfill my father's dreams.

95
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:02,041
But I can't even afford to pay
the college fees.

96
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,875
You and I don't belong to each other.

97
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,541
DIRECTOR
STUDENT COUNCIL OF LUCKNOW UNIVERSITY

98
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,000
-Greetings.
-Bless you.

99
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,583
Yes, I'm aware.
I'm meeting him right now.

100
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,625
-Greetings, sir.
-Good to see you.

101
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,416
Were you ousted from the committee?

102
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,666
Those scoundrels didn't even wait for the
inquiry commission's report to come in.

103
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,166
I would have managed everything.

104
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,250
-But...
-But what?

105
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,916
Gyanu, my dismissal is not the problem.

106
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,416
The problem is that Thakur Tejpratap Singh
is now the in charge.

107
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,958
Look.

108
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,916
You know it very well that
we've taken the money.

109
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,208
And you've been paid for the task.

110
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,166
I want the papers...

111
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,291
come what may!

112
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,333
By hook or by crook.

113
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,041
Otherwise, there will
be grave consequences.

114
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,875
I just came up with these lines for you.

115
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,166
Do you want to hear it?

116
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,875
"You're a Pandit, I'm a Thakur!

117
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,791
That isn't much of a problem.

118
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,833
But, be careful...

119
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,625
lest you get beaten up.

120
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:46,291
Bear in mind the bundles of money
that I showered upon you.

121
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,500
You shall be dishonored...

122
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,333
lest I reveal all the secrets."

123
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,250
Got it?

124
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:16,958
Keep it here.

125
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,875
And...

126
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,291
I've asked you to stop drinking.

127
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:34,250
The doctor has given up,
yet you won't stop drinking.

128
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,500
-Your daughter has left me exhausted.
-Why?

129
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:06,666
We roamed around the entire market,
but she liked nothing!

130
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,458
That's okay. She's our only daughter.

131
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,750
She's soon to be engaged.

132
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,833
-Dad, guess what?
-What?

133
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,291
Mom is buying me saris.

134
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,708
But no one wears saris these days.

135
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,083
All right, I'll buy you miniskirts.

136
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:28,000
Your in-laws will be very proud of you.

137
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,625
Get me skirts.

138
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:37,250
Okay, I'll gift all your saris to Manjiri
for her wedding.

139
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,125
Yes, she'll look pretty in a sari.

140
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,666
Right?

141
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,041
We'll leave, sir.

142
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,625
Yes, sir.

143
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,375
Don't you worry.

144
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,666
The university is all yours.

145
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,833
Gyanu will handle everything.

146
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:03,750
Yes.

147
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,333
Bye.

148
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:11,583
Mr. Thakur, I think I should contest
the legislative elections.

149
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,375
Forget it, Mr. Jindal.

150
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,958
Why become an MLA?

151
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,791
It costs 50 crore rupees to
contest the legislative elections.

152
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:22,291
The high command wants tasks done
at a certain cost.

153
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,708
Don't get into these things.
Your business is good enough.

154
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,375
You make millions every year.

155
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,916
Mr. Thakur, people don't come to
my institute because we teach well.

156
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:37,083
They come,
because we guarantee admissions.

157
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,375
People have a lot of money.

158
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,958
They don't trust their children.

159
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,000
They trust the guarantee that we provide.

160
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,750
-Greetings, brother.
-Chhote!

161
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,000
-Yes.
-How are you?

162
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,041
I'm fine.

163
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,041
Sit down.

164
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,000
-Where's Gyanu?
-He's in college.

165
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,791
Ask him to meet me tonight.

166
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,208
Okay.

167
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,125
-How are you?
-I'm good.

168
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,916
Where were you?
You didn't come home until the wee hours.

169
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,791
You're about to get married in a few days.

170
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:13,958
-Chhote.
-Yes?

171
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,375
-Keep an eye on him.
-He's your son, Mr. Thakur.

172
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,541
He can't keep track of the
things he does during the day.

173
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,166
And you're worried about
his nightly activities.

174
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,458
Yes, I'll hand him the phone.

175
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,041
Bless you.

176
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,041
Greetings, sir.

177
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,041
-How are you, Gyanu?
-Great, thanks to your blessings.

178
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,125
I've heard that Pundit was dismissed.

179
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,500
That's great.

180
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,208
I'm sure you know that

181
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,958
Kshatriyas never lack zeal
and Brahmans never feel satisfied.

182
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,083
Take you and me for example.

183
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,291
The students will now have a great future.

184
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:23,291
Form a committee after
careful investigation.

185
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,958
You can consult me
for any help, if needed.

186
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,750
I know what everyone's up to.

187
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,416
Have you read the Ramayana, Gyanu?

188
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,916
If Rama had gauged Marich's deceit...

189
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,375
things wouldn't have been ruined.

190
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,500
Rascal! The oldie hurt my feelings!

191
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,208
Hey, there.

192
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,208
How are you?

193
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,166
Greetings, brother.

194
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,500
Sit down, Gyanu.

195
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,291
Mr. Jindal.

196
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,208
From Delhi to Patna...

197
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,000
he owns 72 coaching centers.

198
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,208
He has a complaint.

199
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,458
The delivery was late last year.

200
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,333
The papers should reach on time
this year.

201
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,541
Look, I've already given him my word.

202
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,791
It will be done.

203
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,958
CPMT, 40 lakhs. Engineering, 30 lakhs.
MBA, 20 lakhs.

204
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,125
That's the rate for the admissions
this year.

205
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,541
You earn crores of rupees,
and pay us hardly any money.

206
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,833
If you want the business to grow...

207
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,083
you need to start paying me more.

208
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,916
Yes, I'll be right there.

209
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,916
Throw everyone out!

210
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,750
Lala, get us some ginger tea.

211
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,208
Hello, brother.

212
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:30,250
Some call me crazy

213
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:34,500
Some think I am mad

214
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,291
Wow!

215
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,291
Hello, brother.

216
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,583
What's wrong?

217
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,125
Did you thrash someone up,
or get thrashed?

218
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,541
Brother, I like a girl.

219
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,375
Does she know that you like her?

220
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,083
No, I haven't told her yet.

221
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,541
Rascal.

222
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,125
Tiwari's men came there yesterday.

223
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,041
-They were teasing her.
-Then?

224
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,416
-I beat them up.
-Bravo!

225
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,791
-Today, I was on my way.
-And?

226
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,833
And they beat me up.

227
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,708
You got thrashed!

228
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He's a Rajput, born to rule!

229
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,958
Bro, Tiwari is trying really hard
to win the upcoming elections.

230
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,833
Oh, come on.

231
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,125
Incompetent people need to make efforts.

232
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,791
Here you are, my beloved!

233
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,875
I waited for you yesterday.
Why didn't you come?

234
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,833
I can't tell you

235
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,500
What you mean to me...

236
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,791
When I see you...

237
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,250
Raja, look at her.

238
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,791
I didn't know what to say.

239
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,125
Soha is very impulsive and reckless.

240
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,625
-She's silly.
-Why were you blushing?

241
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:18,000
Manjiri, please help me.

242
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,708
I'm your classmate.

243
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,666
Am I right, mister?

244
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:32,250
I hope you don't mind if she helps me.

245
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:38,291
Let me do it for you.
How can I help you?

246
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,416
No! Not you.

247
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,458
My teacher said that I will gain wisdom

248
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,750
only if Goddess Saraswati blesses me.

249
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:51,708
Let's go, Ajay.

250
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,291
You--

251
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:11,666
Rascal! How dare you tease a girl
in my college?

252
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,333
You should be ashamed of yourself.

253
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,500
I apologize on his behalf.

254
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:20,250
If this happens again, let me know.

255
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,750
Trust me, I'll handle it.

256
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,500
What's your name?

257
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,208
Ajay, let's go.

258
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,125
Who is he?

259
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:06,250
He is the peon's son.
His name is Ajay.

260
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,333
Rascal!

261
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,916
The father is lowly,
but the son aims high!

262
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,916
Sir, do you need anything else?

263
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,916
No.

264
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,958
You can go to bed now.

265
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,541
Okay, sir.

266
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,625
I met Chaube, the librarian.

267
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:05,375
He said that Mr. Thakur asked
for some books from the library.

268
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,500
Work on the papers has begun.

269
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:09,208
Who was with him?

270
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:13,791
Nobody.

271
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,875
Some steno or assistant?

272
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,166
There must be someone.

273
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:21,791
Nobody, for now.

274
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,916
He doesn't trust anyone.

275
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:28,083
That means, the oldie
will do things all alone.

276
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,583
He'll die.

277
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,416
Give me a bidi.

278
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,250
One matchbox as well.

279
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,000
LOCAL LIQUOR SHOP

280
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:02,375
What is it?

281
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,666
Prince!

282
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,750
Why are you sulking? What's wrong?

283
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,458
Nothing.

284
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,291
Don't you trust me?

285
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,708
That's not how it is.

286
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,500
I trust you.

287
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,416
The exams are near.

288
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,208
I'm scared.

289
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,000
What if I don't pass the exams?

290
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,208
I'm sure...

291
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,458
you'll get the highest score.

292
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,416
Oh, no!

293
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:27,291
You fill my eyes

294
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:33,166
With dreams

295
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:38,958
I see you

296
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:44,750
In all the faces I see

297
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:50,416
You reveal yourself, page by page

298
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:55,916
It's only you

299
00:27:56,041 --> 00:28:01,750
I searched the heart many times

300
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:07,375
But you're all I find in there

301
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:13,000
Only you

302
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:18,583
Only you

303
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:24,250
Only you

304
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:29,458
Only you

305
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:09,500
At the crack of dawn
And when dusk arrives

306
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:15,333
Be with me

307
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:20,833
I live for you

308
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:26,375
Why should I live without you?

309
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:32,125
My lips utter your name
Like a prayer

310
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:37,666
Only you

311
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:45,666
You're etched on my hands like my fate

312
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:49,041
Only you

313
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:54,625
You reveal yourself, page by page

314
00:29:54,791 --> 00:30:00,416
It's only you

315
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:06,000
I searched the heart many times

316
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:11,625
But you're all I find in there

317
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:17,250
Only you

318
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:22,708
Only you

319
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:28,583
Only you

320
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,791
Only you

321
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:44,666
Make us proud!

322
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,541
We passed the exams, Uncle!

323
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:53,291
Congratulations, my dear!

324
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,416
Have some sweets.

325
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,958
Here you go.

326
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:00,125
Ajay passed the IAS exams.

327
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,208
-Hurry up!
-We need a party!

328
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,875
Only the interview remains!

329
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:08,708
IAS! IAS!

330
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:11,333
Stop it! Put me down!

331
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,000
Relax.

332
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,583
Bloody...

333
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,875
Where were you?

334
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,041
Better late than never.

335
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,125
No problem.

336
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:39,916
Why do you smoke so much?
It's bad.

337
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,583
Bad things are sought to bring an end
to all the other bad things in the world!

338
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,625
Yes, he's the incarnation
of Lord Mahadev!

339
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,958
He alone shall end all evil.

340
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,500
Let's go eat, I'm hungry.

341
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,416
Dad!

342
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,500
Well...

343
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,750
That broke my heart.

344
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,500
Let me do something...

345
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:13,208
for you and your father.

346
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:18,916
I'm your friend. We're like brothers.

347
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,666
My father has a lot of money.

348
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:27,666
It's all mine.

349
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,125
-We're friends.
-He's right, Ajay.

350
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,166
Friendship is beyond favors.

351
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:42,625
No, buddy.
If I take help from any of you...

352
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,125
Dad's efforts...

353
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,375
and his honesty will go to waste.

354
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:56,083
I won't let that happen.

355
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:03,208
Oh, God!

356
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,208
Oh, God!

357
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:13,208
Oh, God!

358
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,666
Oh, God!

359
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,250
You want to soar above the clouds

360
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:49,250
But you're tied to the ground

361
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:55,000
You want to soar above the clouds

362
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:58,125
But you're tied to the ground

363
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:02,208
Nobody can stop you from
succeeding in life, my boy.

364
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,791
The heart is like a bird

365
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:13,291
It seeks its home

366
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,875
The heart is like a bird

367
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:20,000
It shatters

368
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:22,875
Yet, lives on

369
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:26,208
I wonder what this heart seeks

370
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,291
The heart is like a bird

371
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:33,291
It seeks its home

372
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,375
The heart is like a bird

373
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:41,458
Oh, God!

374
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:45,708
Oh, God!

375
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:53,708
Oh, God!

376
00:35:54,583 --> 00:36:00,125
Oh, God!

377
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,791
Dad!

378
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,666
That's enough, Dad.

379
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:54,541
Enough.

380
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,333
Shame on you!

381
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:15,041
-Thakur Tejpratap Singh!
-Shame on you!

382
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,875
The papers have been leaked
for the third year in a row.

383
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:22,333
These papers have been sold
for about five lakh rupees.

384
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:27,541
This has jeopardized the future
of millions of students.

385
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:31,000
To oppose this, student unions
have taken to the streets.

386
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:34,291
They're demonstrating their
anger with violent rampage.

387
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:38,541
Professor Tejpratap Singh
has been arrested.

388
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,666
Shut it down!

389
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,083
Shut it down!

390
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,750
I don't know how this happened.

391
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,291
I didn't even hire an assistant.

392
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:53,791
I know that, Dad.
You could never do this.

393
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56,541
But you needn't worry.

394
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,500
I won't let you stay here for long.

395
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,916
Hundreds of students are protesting
against Professor Tejpratap Singh

396
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,041
at the Hasanganj police station.

397
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:08,333
Students have taken a firm stance
because the papers get leaked every year.

398
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:13,083
They want the professor
to be punished severely.

399
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,708
-Aunt!
-Mom!

400
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:18,291
-Aunt!
-What happened, Mom?

401
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,291
Get some water!

402
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,750
-Aunt!
-Have some water, Mom.

403
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,583
I'll call the doctor.

404
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,750
-Tejpratap is a thief!
-He is a thief!

405
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,250
-Tejpratap is a thief!
-He is a thief!

406
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:34,541
-Tejpratap is a thief!
-Look at them.

407
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:37,041
-We need to go there.
-Tejpratap is a thief!

408
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:39,750
-Tejpratap is a thief!
-He is a thief!

409
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,958
-Get these medicines.
-Okay, Doctor.

410
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,666
Get these medicines.

411
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,250
Doctor, is it serious?

412
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,791
No, there's nothing to worry about.

413
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:53,708
Please go.

414
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,250
It's a case of hypertension
caused by stress.

415
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:59,916
If she doesn't get better,
get her hospitalized tomorrow.

416
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:05,625
I made a huge mistake.

417
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:08,833
My boss is a good man, and I...

418
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:11,458
I'll tell everything to the police.

419
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,416
I'll get him released, come what may.

420
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,416
I'll get the culprits arrested.

421
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:24,958
Bro, it's the oldie.

422
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:25,958
Who?

423
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,791
-Rajkumar.
-Answer it.

424
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:31,958
Yes, tell me.

425
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,166
You said it wouldn't be a big deal.

426
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,291
But my boss got jailed.

427
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,208
His wife is ill.

428
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:40,416
I...

429
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,458
I'll tell everything to the police.

430
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,375
I'll tell them everything!

431
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,208
Tell him I'll be there.

432
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,875
It's pretty late. Why isn't Rajkumar back?

433
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:11,666
-Please look after Mom, I'll go check.
-Okay.

434
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,291
Give me that.

435
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,833
Be careful.

436
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,750
-Hello, sir.
-You ruined it!

437
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:41,625
Come to the police station with me.
I'll tell them everything!

438
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,875
-Wait...
-My boss wasn't at fault.

439
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,541
-Listen to me!
-Just come with me.

440
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,583
Listen to me!

441
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,916
He just doesn't get it!

442
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:16,375
Gyanu, he framed me.

443
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,583
I made a mistake.

444
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,875
My boss is in jail and his wife is unwell.

445
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,125
The police considers me a suspect.

446
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:30,000
And now they'll know for sure.

447
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,875
Nab her!

448
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:38,333
Nab her!

449
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:39,833
-Get her!
-Help!

450
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,416
Where is everyone?
Nab her!

451
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,583
Nab her...

452
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:48,166
Ajay, Aunt's condition is worsening.

453
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,541
Rajkumar went to get her meds.
And then Soha went looking for him.

454
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:53,791
But they haven't returned yet.

455
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,000
Don't worry. We're on our way.

456
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:18,666
Soha!

457
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:28,708
-Soha!
-Ajay!

458
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,916
Some call me crazy

459
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:19,541
Some call me a killer

460
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:43,375
Oh, dear! This looks like a battlefront.

461
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:57,708
A molester got killed!

462
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,000
Yes, sir. It does seem so.

463
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:08,791
The stole is stained

464
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:12,583
How do I hide it?

465
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:16,875
The stole is stained...

466
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:25,083
Who are you? The villain's aide?

467
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:29,500
Sir, he killed my brother.

468
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:32,458
Who killed whom?

469
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:37,625
Ajay did!
He killed Gyanu.

470
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:39,458
Gyanu?

471
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,291
Who's Gyanu?

472
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:45,708
Bro!

473
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:51,666
The student leader Gyanu Singh?

474
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:56,208
He was martyred.

475
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:03,375
It seems like a crucial case, Dubey.

476
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,250
Some call me crazy

477
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:22,875
Some call me mad

478
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,416
He was also against corruption.

479
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:36,458
Some call me crazy, some call me mad

480
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:41,416
The third one?

481
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:50,250
Sir, there's one more.

482
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,333
-Master...
-Is it?

483
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:57,875
Tell me, why did this happen?

484
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:05,500
Idiot!

485
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:11,375
You're on the verge of getting killed...

486
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:14,791
but you won't stop being a rogue.

487
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:19,208
Think hard.

488
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:24,041
I need you to tell me what happened here.
Or else, you'll be dead.

489
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:30,958
No, sir. Now that brother's dead...

490
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:37,666
Getting papers leaked was
Gyanu's regular business.

491
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,333
He made a lot of money
over the past two years.

492
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:47,125
But this time,
Mr. Thakur was the in charge.

493
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:49,833
He's an honest man.

494
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:53,208
But that day...

495
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:11,083
Yes, you can come in.

496
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,875
Everything was all right.

497
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,833
But, suddenly

498
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:30,458
Rajukumar called to say that

499
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,875
he'll go to the police station.

500
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:34,416
So, we came here.

501
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:36,333
And that's how this happened.

502
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:38,500
-Dubey.
-Yes, sir?

503
00:49:38,666 --> 00:49:39,958
Take them in custody

504
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:41,500
and file a report.

505
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:44,208
-But, sir...
-Think about it!

506
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:49,250
The papers were being leaked
for three years in a row.

507
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:52,416
Three murders took place.

508
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,125
The senior officers will be here
any minute.

509
00:49:55,916 --> 00:49:59,625
The media will come here
and interview us.

510
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:04,458
Then, in the evening...

511
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,875
My father used to say...

512
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,250
"Opportunities have to be created."

513
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:59,791
Rahul, any news?

514
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:02,583
No news yet.

515
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,333
Mom's condition is worsening.

516
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,458
Please don't cry, Soha.

517
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:18,125
PARTY OFFICE, BARABANKI

518
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,833
Yes, Arjun. How are you?

519
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,291
There's a big problem.

520
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,666
What happened?

521
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,583
Well,

522
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:32,208
-the student leader Gyanu Singh...
-Yes?

523
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,541
We got into a fight with him.

524
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,041
He shot Ajay.

525
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:39,166
What?

526
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,000
-Is Ajay all right?
-Yes...

527
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:43,541
The doctor is trying
to get the bullet out.

528
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:48,416
Ajay fired in retaliation
and killed him, perhaps.

529
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:51,333
I don't know what to do.

530
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:55,916
Should we tell the police?

531
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,458
No, don't do that.

532
00:51:57,916 --> 00:52:01,625
Bring Ajay to the timber mart.
I'll meet you there.

533
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,250
-Okay?
-All right.

534
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:22,500
Sir, the entire city
is under surveillance.

535
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:23,916
There's no way they can escape.

536
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,750
A ruckus in the university,
during the day.

537
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:27,833
And...

538
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:30,625
the murder of the university president,
during the night.

539
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:33,375
I'm answerable for your carelessness.

540
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:36,958
You have 24 hours, officer.

541
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:39,083
If the perpetrators aren't caught...

542
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,375
Sir, I promise!

543
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:52,541
I will solve this case within 24 hours.

544
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:56,041
If I fail to do so, I will resign.

545
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46,708
Dad!

546
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:49,125
Ajay!

547
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:52,041
Hey!

548
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,833
What happened?

549
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,750
What have we done?

550
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,833
Everything got ruined in one moment.

551
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,500
I don't think so.

552
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:15,125
He'd have killed you,
if you hadn't killed him.

553
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:18,208
He would have killed me.

554
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:20,541
So be it.

555
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,208
I am now a disgrace to my father.
He'll die of this trauma.

556
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:27,625
Nothing will happen to your father.

557
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:32,333
Nothing!

558
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,625
Your life is engulfed by a storm.

559
00:54:37,416 --> 00:54:40,750
But just as storms arise,
they subside too.

560
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:45,625
Ajay, these are testing times.

561
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,375
Show some restraint.

562
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:51,125
-I want to meet my father.
-No. It won't be wise to go there.

563
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:54,208
If you go there,
and if the police nabs you...

564
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,375
you'll be incriminated.

565
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:03,125
You'll spend the rest of your life
proving the actual turn of events.

566
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:07,958
Uncle!

567
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:12,041
-Yes?
-Get food for all of them.

568
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:13,041
Okay.

569
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:18,208
Does your family know?

570
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:24,250
No. Please don't tell them.

571
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:33,541
I'll go check the situation over there.

572
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,083
Where does Dinanath live?

573
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:48,500
-Dinanath?
-Yes.

574
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:50,125
-That's his house.
-Over there?

575
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:53,500
Sir, that's his house.

576
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:03,875
What's the matter, sir?

577
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:09,500
Are you Ajay Singh's father?

578
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,166
Yes.

579
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:13,166
Where is he?

580
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,875
He's at the hostel.

581
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,875
Is he all right?

582
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:22,291
He is.

583
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:26,583
But the ones he thrashed,
aren't all right.

584
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:30,000
He murdered three people and fled.

585
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:32,625
Murdered them?

586
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:39,333
Sir, I'm sure you are mistaken.

587
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:42,083
Sir, this can't be true.

588
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:45,250
He's preparing to be an IAS officer.

589
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:49,583
Yes, sir.

590
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:51,916
That's never going to happen.

591
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:53,625
What?

592
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:59,291
My father used to say that...

593
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:04,875
parents who have good children
are very fortunate.

594
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:11,458
But those with bad children...
Well, their life becomes a living hell.

595
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:18,791
Ideally, you should have known
that he is a criminal.

596
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:20,375
Didn't you know it?

597
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,666
-Well, sir...
-I want to know where he is.

598
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:28,875
When you know his whereabouts...

599
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:34,541
contact Inspector Rajpal Singh
immediately.

600
00:57:36,458 --> 00:57:39,208
Otherwise, you'll have to
face dire consequences.

601
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,416
But, sir...

602
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,666
Sir!

603
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:25,916
Poor Gyanu!
He cared a lot about his students.

604
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,583
-Chhote!
-Chhote!

605
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:39,500
Hello! Who are you?

606
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,833
I'm Chhote, Gyanu's younger brother.

607
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:45,791
You survived the attack.

608
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:48,875
I don't care about that.
My brother was killed.

609
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:51,041
Ajay killed my brother.

610
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:54,208
Sir...

611
00:58:57,916 --> 00:59:01,250
Sir, you can take all the money.
But don't spare the culprit.

612
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:03,125
Wow!

613
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,000
Don't you worry.

614
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,833
I'm an honest cop.
I won't spare him.

615
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:16,791
The government pays us to nab
the criminals, not spare them.

616
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:18,416
I won't spare him.

617
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:25,125
Dubey, Gyanu was a great student leader!

618
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,541
He helped students when he was alive.

619
00:59:27,625 --> 00:59:29,125
And his demise has benefited us.

620
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:33,000
For me, he has opened the gates
of promotion and wealth.

621
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:36,541
Dubey, pack all the money.

622
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:38,958
We'll count it at leisure.

623
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:04,541
My father used to say that
three is an unlucky number.

624
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:07,291
Now, it's four.

625
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:09,250
Why did you kill him, sir?

626
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:10,833
I didn't kill him.

627
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:12,791
I freed him.

628
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:15,125
Forget him and think about yourself.

629
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:18,833
Will you go empty-handed to meet Gyanu,
or take some chicken with you?

630
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Sir...

631
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,000
Spare me.

632
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,916
I'll do as you say.

633
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:28,000
Will you be my witness?

634
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,625
Sure, sir.

635
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,125
Tomorrow's headline would read...

636
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:37,125
The culprits of the murders that
took place near Lucknow university,

637
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:39,708
and the ones responsible
for leaking the papers,

638
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:40,916
have been nabbed.

639
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,166
The police had to face a violent mob
during the investigation.

640
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,416
A perpetrator named Rakesh Tiwari
aka Master, was killed.

641
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,208
And the other perpetrator Raja
was arrested.

642
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:55,541
He has confessed that the papers
were being leaked for three years

643
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:59,000
by a gang headed by Ajay Singh.

644
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,291
He was preparing to be an IAS officer.

645
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:04,541
With the help of student leader
Gyanu Singh

646
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:06,416
he carried out his illegal activities.

647
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,916
That's absolute rubbish!

648
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:10,333
We haven't leaked the papers!

649
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,541
He is the main culprit.

650
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,250
Was Rajkumar Gyanu's aide?

651
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:15,750
He killed student leader Gyanu,

652
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:19,125
Rajukumar and another aide.

653
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:22,916
Professor Tejpratap Singh
has been acquitted.

654
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,333
And his wife's untimely demise
is mourned.

655
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:29,875
Inspector Rajpal Singh has informed us
that Ajay Singh's den...

656
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:31,208
I can't believe this!

657
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:34,041
A huge amount of money has been seized.

658
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:36,541
Deputy Inspector General Gautam
and Inspector Rajpal Singh...

659
01:01:36,625 --> 01:01:37,625
Dad!

660
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:41,041
I hope he's okay.

661
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:46,125
I need to meet him.

662
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:49,541
I need to tell him that
we did nothing wrong.

663
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:55,375
Dad will be shattered.

664
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:31,000
Dad!

665
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,458
I didn't do anything, Dad.

666
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:46,666
This is all a lie.

667
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:49,750
I didn't do anything.

668
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:54,625
Forgive me, Dad.

669
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,666
Dad!

670
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:06,625
I made a mistake, Dad.

671
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:09,500
Oh, God!

672
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:10,500
Dad!

673
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,041
Oh, God!

674
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:15,708
Dad!

675
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:19,375
Dad, forgive me.

676
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:23,125
Oh, God!

677
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:28,416
Oh, God!

678
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:50,958
You want to soar above the clouds

679
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,833
But you're tied to the ground

680
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:04,875
I wonder what this heart seeks

681
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:09,000
The heart is like a bird

682
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,375
It seeks its home

683
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:15,083
It shatters

684
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:17,875
Yet, lives on

685
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:21,958
I wonder what this heart seeks

686
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:24,750
The heart is like a bird

687
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:28,250
The heart is like a bird

688
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:30,750
It seeks its home

689
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:36,791
Oh, God!

690
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:43,000
Oh, God!

691
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:49,666
Oh, God!

692
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:56,083
Oh, God!

693
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:33,000
My dreams

694
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:36,291
My dreams have been shattered

695
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:40,958
Like falling stars

696
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:48,541
My eyes wept

697
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:53,708
Like a cloud burst

698
01:05:55,166 --> 01:05:58,458
I wonder why

699
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:01,416
My prayers haven't been answered

700
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,458
Dear, God

701
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:07,833
Why didn't you help me?

702
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:13,875
Oh, God!

703
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:20,416
Oh, God!

704
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:26,916
Oh, God!

705
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:33,416
Oh, God!

706
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:36,625
How are you, Arjun?

707
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:38,458
I'm fine.

708
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,166
I want to talk to Ajay.

709
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,708
Hold on.
It's Manjiri.

710
01:06:44,916 --> 01:06:47,041
-Ajay!
-How are you, Manjiri?

711
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,583
-How's Dad?
-He misses you.

712
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:55,541
The interview is day after tomorrow.

713
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:58,125
I won't be able to attend it.

714
01:06:58,291 --> 01:06:59,333
No, Manjiri.

715
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:00,541
You should attend it.

716
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,375
If not me...

717
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:06,750
at least you should fulfill Dad's dreams.

718
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:10,750
Ajay!

719
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,416
Your Honor, this is not just a case
about three murders,

720
01:07:55,833 --> 01:08:00,833
it is also a case that concerns the future
of thousands of students.

721
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,958
Ajay Singh, and his friends
from the Lucknow University

722
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:06,791
who were accused of
leaking the papers

723
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:09,083
and killing three people,

724
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:10,625
have been denied bail.

725
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:15,250
This incident has badly affected
the reputation of Lucknow University.

726
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:18,291
But Manjiri Shukla,
a student of the same university

727
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:21,625
has bagged the seventh rank
in the IAS exams

728
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:24,375
and made the university proud.

729
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:30,416
Don't cry, Manjiri.

730
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,291
If tears could wipe away misfortune...

731
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:39,250
nobody in the world would be miserable.

732
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:43,291
Why did this happen?

733
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,125
I'm happy for you, Manjiri.

734
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,708
You did very well for yourself.

735
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,541
You scored the seventh rank.

736
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:00,833
I...

737
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:04,291
I am a criminal.

738
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:10,916
Please look after Dad.

739
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:15,208
He has nobody, but me.

740
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:20,416
He worked very hard all his life,
for my sake.

741
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:22,833
But, I...

742
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,458
Don't lose hope, Ajay.

743
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,291
Things will be all right.

744
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:36,166
The truth will be out someday, and...

745
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,375
we'll find a way.

746
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:45,833
Ajay, don't lose hope.

747
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:48,875
I'm with you every step of the way.

748
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:53,500
Always.

749
01:09:57,541 --> 01:10:00,375
Inspector Rajpal
messed up the entire case.

750
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:04,125
Chhote wants to avenge his brother's death
and the cops are helping him do so.

751
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:07,291
-What?
-Yes.

752
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,625
What should we do?

753
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:11,416
Are we supposed to just wait out here?

754
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,041
What else can we do?

755
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,375
The inspector and Chhote...

756
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,958
Let's kill them both.

757
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:24,583
-You're crazy!
-Let's kill them.

758
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:29,458
Is there no way out?

759
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:32,125
Will nobody listen to us?

760
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:34,208
There is a way out.

761
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Surrender.

762
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:48,166
Ajay Singh and his friends
are my clients.

763
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,458
They are afraid.

764
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:52,333
The police might kill them
in a fake encounter.

765
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:53,791
So...

766
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,666
they want to surrender.

767
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:00,000
Let's meet them after lunch.

768
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:16,166
Yes?

769
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:19,208
Ajay and his friends have surrendered.

770
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:21,250
Stop them.

771
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,833
If they surrender, I'll get dismissed.

772
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:25,333
I'll meet you there.

773
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:26,875
Okay, sir.

774
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:30,375
Rascal!

775
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,625
My father was right.

776
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:40,416
Never mess with fire.

777
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:46,000
It burns you down.

778
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:28,791
Sir, I looked everywhere
but didn't find them.

779
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:35,833
Rascal! He wants to be an IAS officer.

780
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:38,666
He is really smart.

781
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:29,958
Brother!

782
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,583
Ajay, run!

783
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,625
You manhandled a lawyer in court!

784
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:49,916
Beat him up.

785
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:25,083
Ajay!

786
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:43,250
Take it easy!

787
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,416
Ajay, get the car!

788
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:49,250
Carry him!

789
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,375
Hurry up!

790
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:58,166
Infamous criminal Ajay, and his aides

791
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:01,333
killed a policeman in broad daylight.

792
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:04,958
This led to a scuffle between
the lawyers and the police.

793
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:08,083
-No!
-Sidhu!

794
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,875
Sidhu, be brave.

795
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:11,500
Sidhu!

796
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,000
-No...
-Sidhu!

797
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:17,625
Have faith. You'll be fine.

798
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,166
My visa is here.

799
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:23,083
Don't talk rubbish!
Nothing's going to happen to you.

800
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:27,083
Sidhu!

801
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:33,750
Sidhu!

802
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:53,500
You have a bright red body

803
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:57,541
That illuminates the world

804
01:15:58,166 --> 01:16:01,916
You disguised yourself

805
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,541
As a long-tailed monkey

806
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:12,041
Your body is strong like thunderbolt
It is meant to kill the enemies

807
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:13,583
If this is my destiny...

808
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:16,750
so be it.

809
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:19,458
Praised be the Lord

810
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:22,500
Hail Lord Hanuman

811
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:25,208
Hail Lord Hanuman

812
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:28,375
Hail Lord Hanuman

813
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,208
Hail Lord Hanuman

814
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:34,250
Your glories spread far and wide

815
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:36,958
Lanka goes up in ashes

816
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:40,000
Your powers, oh mighty one

817
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:43,000
Are beyond the limits of time and death

818
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:48,875
You exude the brilliance of the sun
Your eyes have immense power

819
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:54,583
You protect the world
With your mighty arms

820
01:16:54,791 --> 01:17:00,541
You're the creator and destroyer

821
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:05,833
The stars sing your praises for eternity

822
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:09,166
Hail Lord Hanuman

823
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:12,166
Hail Lord Hanuman

824
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:15,083
Hail Lord Hanuman

825
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,916
Hail Lord Hanuman

826
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:24,000
Hail Lord Hanuman

827
01:17:24,083 --> 01:17:26,791
Hail Lord Hanuman

828
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,500
Hail Lord Hanuman

829
01:18:14,125 --> 01:18:19,625
You embody Lord Rama
And revere Goddess Sita

830
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:25,708
The world is a tempestuous sea
And you're the savior

831
01:18:26,083 --> 01:18:31,750
Our lives begin and end with you

832
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
We worship and revere you

833
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:40,125
You're indestructible and immortal

834
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:42,625
You're the axis
That the world rests upon

835
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:48,666
The one who gets your blessings
Lacks nothing

836
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:54,708
We are your devotees, O Lord
You're our friend and guide

837
01:18:54,833 --> 01:19:00,041
Give us a potion to end all the sorrows
We bow down to you

838
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:03,291
Hail Lord Hanuman

839
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:07,000
Hail Lord Hanuman

840
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:20,750
Victory to you, Lord Hanuman!
Ocean of wisdom, we honor your glory

841
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:22,833
You are the divine messenger of Lord Rama

842
01:19:22,916 --> 01:19:26,125
-Son of God, born of Anjani
-Hail Lord Hanuman

843
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:29,791
You are valiant and brave
O God of good sense and wisdom

844
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:35,416
You are God of beauty and grace

845
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,333
Beauty and grace

846
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:38,958
Hail Lord Hanuman

847
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:43,958
Praised be Goddess Sita and Lord Rama!

848
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:49,208
Hail Lord Hanuman!

849
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,750
Lord Hanuman promised me today.

850
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:07,708
You will surely become a collector.

851
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:29,666
Dad!

852
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:45,208
Bro, I was helpless.

853
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,500
Ajay killed him.

854
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:49,833
He killed my friend!

855
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:55,541
In your presence...

856
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:59,416
Ajay killed my son.

857
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:02,291
And you...

858
01:21:03,166 --> 01:21:05,125
You fled like a coward!

859
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:14,666
Before the 13 days of mourning end...

860
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:17,750
make sure you arrest him.

861
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,291
Otherwise...

862
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:23,166
I will kill him.

863
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:25,833
I assure you, he'll be caught.

864
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:34,500
Yes, sir.

865
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:40,541
COLLECTOR, LUCKNOW

866
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,333
Manjiri!

867
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:10,375
MANJIRI SHUKLA
COLLECTOR, LUCKNOW

868
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,583
What if I don't pass the exams?

869
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:49,500
I'm sure you'll get the highest score.

870
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,916
I couldn't fulfill Dad's dreams.

871
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:55,833
I couldn't become an IAS officer.

872
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:15,416
Uncle!

873
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:32,791
Uncle!

874
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:35,166
Uncle!

875
01:23:35,791 --> 01:23:37,208
Uncle!

876
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:38,833
Uncle!

877
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:41,166
Uncle!

878
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,333
Uncle...

879
01:23:56,958 --> 01:23:59,541
Ajay, I need to take you somewhere.

880
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:01,458
Where?

881
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:03,500
I'll tell you later.

882
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:04,583
Come with me.

883
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:26,708
Why are we here?

884
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:30,875
Arjun?

885
01:24:56,250 --> 01:25:00,875
Oh, God!

886
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:03,375
Oh, God!

887
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:04,333
Dad!

888
01:25:04,416 --> 01:25:05,583
Ajay!

889
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:08,833
-Ajay, control yourself.
-Dad!

890
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:11,041
-Dad!
-Ajay, stop!

891
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:13,583
-Ajay, stop!
-Let go of me!

892
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:14,916
-Stop!
-Ajay!

893
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,291
-The cops are there.
-Dad!

894
01:25:20,041 --> 01:25:21,916
Dad!

895
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:24,541
Everything will be okay.

896
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:29,166
I destroyed myself

897
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:34,500
What do I complain about?

898
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:41,666
I've shattered myself into bits

899
01:25:42,416 --> 01:25:46,791
I can never be whole again

900
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:54,208
I couldn't read what you wrote for me

901
01:25:54,708 --> 01:26:00,666
Just wipe off these lines of fate

902
01:26:01,125 --> 01:26:04,625
I wonder what

903
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:07,208
This heart seeks

904
01:26:07,416 --> 01:26:10,750
The heart is like a bird

905
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,791
It seeks its home

906
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:24,375
Ajay!

907
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:29,625
Ajay!

908
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:52,083
It's all over, sir.

909
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,625
It's over!

910
01:26:58,125 --> 01:26:59,625
Stay strong.

911
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:02,500
I don't know how to do that, sir.

912
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:10,583
Unknowingly, I entered
the world of crime...

913
01:27:11,916 --> 01:27:14,541
and my conscious was against it.

914
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:18,041
But now if I try to leave,

915
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:20,750
it just won't let me.

916
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:30,500
Life is a battlefield.

917
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:34,375
And you're a warrior.

918
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,125
On this battlefield

919
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:45,666
stands yet another warrior.

920
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:47,875
The path you once sought

921
01:27:48,166 --> 01:27:50,125
is now your duty.

922
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:52,166
Who is wrong?

923
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:54,500
And who is the righteous one?

924
01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:59,000
Injustice brings God to the fore.

925
01:27:59,291 --> 01:28:02,708
The sinner thinks he's
the most powerful one.

926
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:08,416
He knows not about the many forms of God!

927
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:28,625
Sir, we know about the ambulance

928
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,666
that Ajay used
to get into the hostel.

929
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:34,000
It's in Sultan's garage
and he can lead us to Ajay Singh.

930
01:28:34,458 --> 01:28:35,416
Let's go.

931
01:28:52,875 --> 01:28:53,875
Yes, Sultan.

932
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,916
It's not Sultan. I'm Nana.

933
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,625
Do you have any idea who he was?

934
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:02,708
Suraj, the son of the city's don
Ajit Singh.

935
01:29:04,166 --> 01:29:08,041
Before he attains salvation,
I'll kill you and your aides.

936
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:11,791
The countdown begins.

937
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:19,375
What kind of a don kills an unarmed man?

938
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:23,291
You are doomed!

939
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:28,708
Before Sultan's body goes cold,
I'll kill you and your boss.

940
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:42,291
Stop it!

941
01:29:42,375 --> 01:29:44,083
Move!

942
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,833
Stay right there!

943
01:29:51,916 --> 01:29:54,291
Convey Ajay Singh's regards to Nana.

944
01:30:00,041 --> 01:30:03,125
War calls for you to destroy the enemies

945
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:05,750
The earth shall bathe in red

946
01:30:06,291 --> 01:30:08,875
War calls for you to destroy the enemies

947
01:30:08,958 --> 01:30:12,416
The earth shall bathe in red

948
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:16,250
This is the time to roar and kill

949
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:18,833
Bring forth your sword

950
01:30:19,416 --> 01:30:21,625
War calls for you to destroy the enemies

951
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:24,583
The earth shall bathe in red

952
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:26,625
I can't kill an unarmed man.

953
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:55,916
Lucknow witnesses gang wars
for supremacy.

954
01:30:56,166 --> 01:31:01,333
Influential MLA Ajit Singh
had a stronghold on railways,

955
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:03,166
PWD and other services.

956
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:09,125
That has all been taken over
by budding gangster Ajay Singh.

957
01:31:09,416 --> 01:31:11,833
War has only one mantra, do or die

958
01:31:12,125 --> 01:31:15,583
There's no other way out of this quagmire

959
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:21,958
All means are justified in war

960
01:31:22,041 --> 01:31:25,791
Nobody's your friend here

961
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:31,833
Behead the enemies

962
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:34,833
And destroy their entities

963
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:38,291
Behead the enemies

964
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:41,291
And destroy their entities

965
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:44,125
War calls for you to destroy the enemies

966
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:47,541
The earth shall bathe in red

967
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,250
Let there be zeal in your arms
And fury in your eyes

968
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:15,000
May their ashes scatter away

969
01:32:17,583 --> 01:32:21,250
Mercy and forgiveness don't bring justice

970
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:24,750
Break this circle and go for the kill

971
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:33,541
Kill demons
And aim your arrow at the sinners

972
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:37,458
War calls for you to destroy the enemies

973
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:40,083
The earth shall bathe in red

974
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:44,125
War calls for you to destroy the enemies

975
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:46,750
The earth shall bathe in red

976
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:05,458
Brother!

977
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:07,333
That's Ajay.

978
01:33:21,416 --> 01:33:23,291
I didn't kill your son.

979
01:33:24,916 --> 01:33:26,625
His deeds got him killed.

980
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:31,916
You and I aren't enemies.

981
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:35,500
Don't get into my path ever again.

982
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,125
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

983
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:02,541
Inspector Rajpal killed many of our men.

984
01:34:03,416 --> 01:34:06,416
That inspector makes my blood boil.

985
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,750
He ruined everyone's lives.

986
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:13,750
I told you we should kill him,
but you didn't agree with me.

987
01:34:14,416 --> 01:34:16,666
Killing an inspector
won't help us in anyway.

988
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:19,166
One will die...

989
01:34:20,166 --> 01:34:21,416
and another will replace him.

990
01:34:22,041 --> 01:34:24,541
Police and ministers
are part of the system.

991
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:27,125
We can't mess with them.

992
01:34:28,583 --> 01:34:31,500
But if things get out of hand...

993
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:34,291
they can't be spared.

994
01:35:00,833 --> 01:35:02,375
INSPECTOR RAJPAL SINGH

995
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:41,333
My father used to say that
the world is like a market.

996
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,666
So, I don't buy expensive things.
How much does that cost?

997
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,375
How much do you want?

998
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:55,541
That's enough for now.

999
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:12,333
God wanted love and peace
to prevail in the world.

1000
01:36:12,416 --> 01:36:15,333
But the likes of you
turned it into a market.

1001
01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:23,625
Hereafter, I'll do...

1002
01:36:25,833 --> 01:36:27,583
exactly what you compelled me to do.

1003
01:37:01,875 --> 01:37:03,541
How did this happen, Ajay?

1004
01:37:03,916 --> 01:37:04,875
This...

1005
01:37:06,916 --> 01:37:08,375
is my destiny.

1006
01:37:09,875 --> 01:37:11,250
We don't plan our lives.

1007
01:37:13,791 --> 01:37:15,541
It's the other way around.

1008
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:22,416
Arjun, speak to him!

1009
01:37:23,333 --> 01:37:26,000
Please stop this bloodshed!

1010
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:28,916
Why don't you guys understand?

1011
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:39,125
Ajay.

1012
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,166
I don't know how you'll do it.

1013
01:37:43,458 --> 01:37:44,833
But please come back.

1014
01:37:51,208 --> 01:37:52,166
I did...

1015
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:58,208
but Dad didn't open the door.

1016
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,833
And now...

1017
01:38:04,166 --> 01:38:05,583
Dad isn't alive.

1018
01:38:08,291 --> 01:38:09,333
He is no more.

1019
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:48,208
Where am I and where are you?

1020
01:38:48,458 --> 01:38:54,791
Where are you and where am I?

1021
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:14,791
Where am I and where are you?

1022
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:20,458
Where are you and where am I?

1023
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:27,791
Where am I and where are you?

1024
01:39:28,416 --> 01:39:33,000
Where are you and where am I?

1025
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:41,166
Everything was beautiful

1026
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:46,875
I wonder what went wrong

1027
01:39:48,875 --> 01:39:51,416
There's darkness all around

1028
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:54,791
Sunshine seems to be somewhere afar

1029
01:39:55,541 --> 01:40:00,166
Life is unbearable

1030
01:40:02,208 --> 01:40:05,041
Where did we come from?

1031
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:08,375
And where will we end up?

1032
01:40:09,041 --> 01:40:13,125
Give me a clue

1033
01:40:55,083 --> 01:41:00,000
How things have changed!

1034
01:41:01,125 --> 01:41:06,000
Why did we part ways?

1035
01:41:08,458 --> 01:41:13,916
My wishes and desires

1036
01:41:15,125 --> 01:41:19,500
Have been destroyed with time

1037
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:24,250
All my joys have disappeared

1038
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:27,541
And left me empty-handed

1039
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:33,416
Wonder what went wrong

1040
01:41:35,541 --> 01:41:41,250
There's darkness all around
Sunshine seems to be somewhere afar

1041
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:46,041
Life is unbearable

1042
01:41:48,875 --> 01:41:51,708
Where did we come from?

1043
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:55,041
And where will we end up?

1044
01:41:55,583 --> 01:42:00,041
Give me a clue

1045
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,250
My father used to say that...

1046
01:43:41,625 --> 01:43:45,416
Kabira often prays for
everyone's happiness.

1047
01:43:46,291 --> 01:43:48,375
He was friends with no one.

1048
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,083
He was no one's enemy either.

1049
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,750
Here we go.

1050
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:24,625
I didn't do anything.

1051
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:26,291
I had forbidden you...

1052
01:44:27,041 --> 01:44:29,708
from obstructing my path.

1053
01:44:30,833 --> 01:44:32,708
Don't kill me--

1054
01:45:06,125 --> 01:45:07,250
Arjun!

1055
01:45:07,916 --> 01:45:10,875
-Are you okay, Arjun?
-I regret one thing.

1056
01:45:12,708 --> 01:45:13,875
No!

1057
01:45:18,125 --> 01:45:21,250
-I'm leaving you alone...
-Arjun!

1058
01:45:28,208 --> 01:45:29,041
Arjun!

1059
01:45:30,083 --> 01:45:31,041
Arjun!

1060
01:45:35,083 --> 01:45:36,625
No, buddy.

1061
01:46:22,458 --> 01:46:27,333
As per the recent reports,
MLA Ajit Singh has been killed.

1062
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:30,958
Supposedly, Ajay Singh is the murderer.

1063
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:34,125
This was a result of a rivalry.

1064
01:46:34,208 --> 01:46:35,041
Glory to India, sir.

1065
01:46:35,125 --> 01:46:37,291
Ajay Singh was a part of the gang war.

1066
01:46:37,375 --> 01:46:39,833
As per sources...

1067
01:46:39,916 --> 01:46:42,000
He killed MLA Ajit Singh!

1068
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:43,916
There will be an uproar in the assembly!

1069
01:46:44,791 --> 01:46:45,625
Yes, sir.

1070
01:46:45,708 --> 01:46:49,291
Before they question me,
do something, officer!

1071
01:46:49,541 --> 01:46:51,083
I'll do my best.

1072
01:46:53,708 --> 01:46:55,125
I give you two options.

1073
01:46:56,291 --> 01:46:57,958
Either get suspended tomorrow...

1074
01:47:00,291 --> 01:47:01,291
or get promoted.

1075
01:47:09,625 --> 01:47:10,708
Glory to India, sir.

1076
01:47:23,791 --> 01:47:25,000
Ajay!

1077
01:47:25,375 --> 01:47:27,708
-Say something!
-I don't know what to say.

1078
01:47:29,541 --> 01:47:30,708
I might die.

1079
01:47:30,791 --> 01:47:32,916
Why are you saying that?

1080
01:47:34,416 --> 01:47:37,083
-Just...
-Nothing will happen to you.

1081
01:47:37,583 --> 01:47:39,708
I want to meet you for the last time.

1082
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,208
I'm really scared.

1083
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:48,458
I'm missing Dad terribly today.

1084
01:47:52,166 --> 01:47:53,291
Ajay!

1085
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:33,291
He is here.

1086
01:49:41,666 --> 01:49:44,208
I told you we should kill him,
but you didn't agree with me.

1087
01:49:55,375 --> 01:49:58,708
There are some officers near that lane
and on the roof...

1088
01:50:10,583 --> 01:50:14,750
Ma'am, we got to know that
Ajay Singh is hiding in there.

1089
01:50:37,625 --> 01:50:41,541
Sir, my father used to say that--

1090
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:43,666
Shut up!

1091
01:51:42,291 --> 01:51:43,916
-Ajay!
-Manjiri.

1092
01:51:45,125 --> 01:51:46,208
Manjiri!

1093
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:48,416
Manjiri!

1094
01:51:49,166 --> 01:51:50,250
Manjiri!

1095
01:51:51,125 --> 01:51:52,375
How did this happen, Manjiri?

1096
01:51:53,958 --> 01:51:55,208
How did this happen?

1097
01:51:57,583 --> 01:52:00,500
If getting shot brings me closer to you...

1098
01:52:01,458 --> 01:52:03,208
I'd get shot over and over again.

1099
01:52:19,583 --> 01:52:23,666
DISTRICT JAIL, LUCKNOW

1100
01:52:25,333 --> 01:52:29,750
Who knew that life would
turn out to be like this?

1101
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:34,041
Momentary anger destroys everything.

1102
01:52:35,041 --> 01:52:37,000
The glamorous world of crimes

1103
01:52:37,583 --> 01:52:39,583
is nothing but an illusion.

1104
01:52:41,458 --> 01:52:44,666
You either end up in jail...

1105
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:48,083
or you die by getting shot.

1106
01:52:48,291 --> 01:52:51,541
It is said that life gives
everyone three chances.

1107
01:52:52,208 --> 01:52:54,916
But for me, this is the last chance.

1108
01:52:59,458 --> 01:53:05,291
Another criminal will be contesting
the elections in Uttar Pradesh next month.

1109
01:53:05,708 --> 01:53:08,625
That is gangster Ajay Singh.

1110
01:53:08,708 --> 01:53:12,541
After his book Pranaam got published,

1111
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:15,791
the youth have taken a liking to him.

1112
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,916
In his autobiography, Ajay Singh

1113
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,458
revealed his journey from being
an IAS aspirant to becoming a don.

1114
01:53:22,625 --> 01:53:27,416
Thousands have gathered here
to welcome him.

1115
01:53:27,541 --> 01:53:31,208
Only time will tell how the
advent of criminals in politics

1116
01:53:31,291 --> 01:53:34,375
will affect the country.

1117
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:42,791
-How should our leader be?
-He should be like Ajay Singh!

1118
01:53:42,875 --> 01:53:46,208
-How should our leader be?
-He should be like Ajay Singh!

1119
01:53:46,458 --> 01:53:50,458
My son is born to rule!

1120
01:53:51,125 --> 01:53:52,583
Rule!

1121
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,625
Glory to Ajay Singh!

1122
01:54:05,083 --> 01:54:07,208
VOTE FOR AJAY SINGH
