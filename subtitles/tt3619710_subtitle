1
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,484
You think it will be our turn today.

2
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,979
I hope so.

3
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,490
I've to give an answer by tomorrow.

4
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,886
If I quit this job and the
new one turns out to be worse..

5
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,859
"Then I am dead.

6
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,863
Savitri .

7
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,928
That's me. Me!

8
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,635
Come, The Acharya will see you now.

9
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,039
I have only one son. Janardhan.

10
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,541
He lives abroad.

11
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,908
He's an accountant.
Works for a big company.

12
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,476
Earlier,
he would come home twice a year.

13
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,984
Soon that changed to just once a year.

14
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,089
On Diwali!

15
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,960
And now he hasn't
shown up for three years.

16
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,024
We do talk when I call him.

17
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,830
Sometimes..he doesn't
even answer my call.

18
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,035
Acharya, I am worried about him.

19
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,040
Have you brought his horoscope? - Yes.

20
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,589
Do you have two sons? Twins?

21
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,188
No..Janardhan's my only son.

22
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,297
Strangehow is this possible?

23
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,902
I've never seen a
horoscope like this before.

24
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,730
What do you mean?

25
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,964
Savitri,
this horoscopes is conveying.

26
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,340
...that..the next few days
is going to be tough for your son.

27
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,737
Oh, God!

28
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,939
If he manages to get out of this.

29
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,610
"Then he may live.

30
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,282
What do I do now? - Look, Savitri.

31
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:38,028
Astrology..can only
predict the future.

32
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,194
Not change..or aver-t it.

33
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,802
If you still want me to help you..

34
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:50,364
"Then I'll have to use other ways.

35
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,303
What way?

36
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,838
Black Magic!

37
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,310
No need to be scared.

38
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,244
I only do it for good deeds.

39
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,056
You can do whatever
you feel's right, Acharya.

40
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,055
Just save my son from the
trouble that's heading towards him.

41
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,957
Where does your son live? - Bangkok.

42
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:40,987
"Seems like tonight..my
luck's not with me."

43
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:47,962
"Come along with me..my
home's not too far."

44
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,862
"There's a restless
running through my body.."

45
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,402
"..like a serpent
creeping on my body."

46
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,765
"No wonder my hear-t fell for you."

47
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:59,071
"My eyes never missed a single lass.."

48
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,238
"..but I got trapped in your eyes."

49
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,078
"I got trapped in your eyes."

50
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,115
"I got trapped in your eyes."

51
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,822
"I got trapped in your eyes."

52
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,326
"I got trapped in your eyes."

53
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:28,327
"I've seen the
world..been everywhere."

54
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,398
"But there's no one like you."

55
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,772
"Listen to be, sweetheart."

56
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,335
"You're mine and I am yours."

57
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,348
"This is what I've
been trying to tell you."

58
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:44,286
"Seems like tonight..my
luck's not with me."

59
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:51,994
"Come along with me..my
home's not too far."

60
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,796
"There's a restless
running through my body.."

61
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,333
"..like a serpent
creeping on my body."

62
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,734
"No wonder my hear-t fell for you."

63
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,103
"My eyes never missed a single lass.."

64
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,143
"..but I got trapped in your eyes."

65
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,043
"I got trapped in your eyes."

66
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,845
"I got trapped in your eyes."

67
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,153
"I got trapped in your eyes."

68
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,484
"I got trapped in your eyes."

69
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,258
"I got trapped in your eyes."

70
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,263
"I got trapped in your eyes."

71
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,194
Johnny, is there any risk in this?

72
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,864
No, risk.

73
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,394
Nice.

74
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,433
Hi, Srija. - Hi.

75
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,133
How have you been?
- Good. How are you?

76
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,267
Looking so nice. - Johnny.

77
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,071
Thank you.

78
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:48,941
Johnny.

79
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,917
Weren't you supposed
to meet me last night, Johnny?

80
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,955
Sorry..l was down with a viral,
you know.

81
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,821
My throat. - Johnny, just go to hell.

82
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,896
Is that how you talk to a sick man?

83
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,229
Fine.

84
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,218
Melissa.

85
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:36,858
Yes.

86
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,987
Somethings wrong with the computer.
Says "Access Denied".

87
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,234
I don't know what's wrong
but I know somethings not right.

88
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,161
What do you mean?

89
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,633
The Shark's been asking for you.
She wants to meet you in her cabin.

90
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,203
Really?

91
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,509
Ma'am.

92
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,066
Come in, Johnny.

93
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,310
Sit.

94
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,316
Four years ago my husband fell sick.

95
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,211
That's when I took over the company.

96
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,453
I upped the turnover from
10 million Dollars..to 40 million.

97
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,655
Do you think I've done a good job?
- Good job?

98
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,158
Ma'am, I think you've
done a fantastic job.

99
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,454
Only you could've done it.

100
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,058
Congratulations on that.

101
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,161
Maybe that's why you
all call me "The Shark".

102
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:21,701
Shark?

103
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,941
No, ma'am.
Who can call you the Shark?

104
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,176
I guess you heard it wrong.

105
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,906
Maybe I heard it wrong.

106
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,370
By the way..

107
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,239
I've heard about you..

108
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,513
...that you're the no.1 Romeo around.

109
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:43,659
Really?

110
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,159
There's not much competition,
but. Sure.

111
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,498
Cute. Very cute.

112
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,036
I prefer charming but, cute will do.

113
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,007
And cunning..what about cunning?

114
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,107
Excuse me.

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,503
We loaded a spyware on
all the computers of our firm.

116
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,273
Someone was leaking
the firm's secrets.

117
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,409
...and we wanted to
know who's doing it.

118
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:12,281
So we recorded all the firm's emails.
Incoming and Outgoing.

119
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,154
And these..are your emails.

120
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,994
You're stealing from the firm.

121
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,087
With due respect,
ma'am..this is nonsense.

122
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,026
Why..why would I steal?

123
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,364
Insider Trading.
Do you know what that means?

124
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,592
Let me explain.

125
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,669
If the Firm gets a big contract.

126
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,735
...and you inform a friend
of yours about this contract.

127
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:31,737
...before the public announcement.

128
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,638
And then invest in the
stock market through that friend.

129
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,378
When the public announcement is made..

130
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,711
"Stock prices go
up and you make millions.

131
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,616
Very bad boy, Johnny.

132
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,146
This is rubbish.
l..l told no one.

133
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,792
The man you're giving
the information to..is Donald.

134
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,028
You even sent your emails to him.

135
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,090
And he bought all shares of our Firm!

136
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,104
It's an open and shut case, Johnny.

137
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,232
But you can check that file
if you like. Those are your emails.

138
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,537
Go on, take a look.

139
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,308
But remember, Johnny.

140
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,644
The punishment for Insider
Trading in this country is 10 years.

141
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,451
Rigorous Imprisonment!

142
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,661
Not just that..I'll hire
the best lawyer in town.

143
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,663
And I'll make sure that
you stay behind bars for 10 years.

144
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,721
Every Tv channel, every News Network.

145
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,825
...will be talking about Johnny Arora.

146
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,699
Do you know what, take a look.

147
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,596
I am in no hurry to call the Police.

148
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,086
Mrs. Bakshi, l..

149
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,992
I admit making some
money in the stock market.

150
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,160
I am very sorry for that.

151
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,696
But..l didn't steal anything
from the company, ma'am.

152
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:05,025
And..everyone indulges
in low-level Insider Trading.

153
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,469
It's not a big..
- Not everyone's caught, Johnny.

154
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,409
You could've handed
me over to the Police.

155
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,414
But you didn't do that.

156
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,548
What do you want?

157
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,520
I want you to go to Pataya
and enjoy three days of vacation.

158
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,727
You mean..either I
go to jail for 10 years..

159
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,625
...or Pataya on vacation..or
else you will fire me?

160
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,294
Correct!

161
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:40,630
Ma'am..

162
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,737
"Either you're confused between
justice and punishment or else..

163
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,343
There's no confusion, Johnny.
I don't have time.

164
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,341
Jail..or Pataya Grand Resort!

165
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,012
Pataya 1

166
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,391
Hello. Sudesh, Johnny speaking.

167
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,834
I want to get to Mumbai today.

168
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,168
What is the first flight
you can book me on?

169
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,432
Any class..just get me out of here.

170
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,942
Yeah..I'll pay by credit card. Yeah!

171
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,845
Run Johnny!

172
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,893
Hello! - Where are you going, Johnny?

173
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:41,954
Sir, should we leave?

174
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:43,896
India?

175
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,834
No, ma'am.
I am just around the corner.

176
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,300
Bad boy, Johnny.

177
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,535
You were supposed to go to
Pataya and you're heading for India.

178
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:53,942
Get one thing straight.

179
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,503
If you get to the airport the
Police will be waiting to receive you.

180
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,139
Now quietly get down the taxi..

181
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,117
...and head to Pataya
for your vacation.

182
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,219
I'll see you there.

183
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,352
And listen..no more surprises.

184
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:10,925
<i>M'</i>

185
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,166
Hi, Johnny Arora.

186
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,064
I believe you have a booking for me.

187
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,901
Yes, we do. Room 401.

188
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:28,841
Thank you.

189
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,407
Oh sir, a man is waiting
for you in the lobby.

190
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:33,942
That one, there.

191
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,046
Hi, I am Johnny.

192
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,593
And you are?

193
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,251
I am nobody.

194
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,996
Wow..what a name. Nobody.

195
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,261
Nice name.

196
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,562
For you. Mrs. Bakshi sent it for you.

197
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:55,867
Her name is Tanya.

198
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,007
She's staying in this resort.

199
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:58,935
So.

200
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,107
You will meet her..get to know her.

201
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,837
Oh..you mean..

202
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,916
Slowly take this love forward..and
then cross all boundaries!

203
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,014
Wow, Johnny..what
an amazing punishment.

204
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,852
Now listen Mr. Nobody.

205
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,548
Love, friendship..l don't know..

206
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:19,255
...but the part about crossing
all boundaries, consider that done.

207
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,996
I am pretty good at it.

208
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,160
By the way..

209
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,861
Tell Mrs. Bakshi not to worry.

210
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,034
I will handle this.

211
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,418
"Dad and mom are not at home."

212
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,191
"We'll lock ourselves
in the back room.."

213
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:58,133
"..and do something secretly.
Come see me."

214
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,268
"We'll watch English films."

215
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,175
"Filled with love scenes."

216
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:12,010
"Let your desires run wild.
Come see me."

217
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,987
"There are no restrictions."

218
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,922
"Say something obscene,"

219
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,360
"Drop that curtain of shame."

220
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,887
"We'll stick together..like
chewing gum."

221
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,333
<i>"I'll</i> feel great in your arms."

222
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,098
"Dad and mom are.."

223
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,866
"Dad and mom are.."

224
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,930
"Dad and mom are not at home."

225
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,533
"We'll lock ourselves
in the back room.."

226
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:43,375
"..and do something secretly.
Come see me."

227
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,535
"Don't make any more excuses now."

228
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,305
"Don't blow my fuse
when I turn off the lights."

229
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,073
"Come on..dance with me."

230
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,910
"Everybody say dad and mom"

231
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,247
"All I want to do..is
talk about love."

232
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,879
"All my nights are free for you."

233
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,082
"You're a beautiful girl."

234
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,626
"And you've got a spark."

235
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,591
"You're a beautiful girl."

236
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,256
"And you've got a spark."

237
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,927
"I want to burn in your arms."

238
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,670
"Dad and mom are.."

239
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,270
"Dad and mom are.."

240
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,273
"Dad and mom are not at home."

241
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,138
"We'll lock ourselves
in the back room.."

242
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,338
"..and do something secretly.
Come see me."

243
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,380
Hi.

244
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,165
Knock..knock!

245
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,402
Knock..knock!

246
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,338
Can I come inside?

247
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,632
Inside where?

248
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,538
For now, in your life.

249
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,271
But with your permission.

250
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:02,109
Oh..so you're one of them. - No.

251
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,481
I'm much better.

252
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,085
But..these things from out here..
Open the door.

253
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,391
Look, madam, please open the door.
The weather out here is quite bad.

254
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,101
I can't find the key.

255
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,203
0K8?'-

256
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,246
Oh.. Thank God.

257
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,087
Saved.

258
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,434
Thank God the window was open.

259
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,695
Or else I would've frozen out there.

260
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:00,969
When you're done doing this
please tell me what do you want?

261
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,742
Not much..just a little help. - I see.

262
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,180
Please don't mind, but who are you?

263
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,179
My name's Janardhan Arora.

264
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,656
But you can call me Johnny.

265
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,722
I live in Bangkok,
and work there as well.

266
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,123
I also make good money.

267
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,458
But it's a little boring.

268
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,695
So I took a three day vacation
and came to see Pataya.

269
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,726
Holiday budget is pretty good.

270
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,769
But spending all that money
alone is a little difficult.

271
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,474
So I need your help.

272
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,046
I need a friend like you.

273
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,382
Found it.

274
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,415
Really?

275
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,386
K6'!-

276
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,520
Lovely meeting you.

277
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,158
If three days are too long,
maybe 3 hours are better.

278
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,066
I'm sure you enjoy wine.

279
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,464
Coffee?

280
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,362
I can drink tea too.

281
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,233
Okay, I admit..it's a bit too soon.

282
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,337
Some other time?

283
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,105
Actually,
even I am staying on the 4th floor.

284
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,303
We can have a drink later, maybe?

285
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:11,807
Maybe?

286
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,501
Mr. Nobody.

287
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,237
There's an extent to
keeping an eye on someone.

288
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,200
Are you planning to watch me sleep?

289
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,509
What's this?

290
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,553
What's this?

291
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,230
Hello. - I'm sure you got the gun.

292
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,006
And I'm sure you're
smart to understand.

293
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,435
"What you've to do with it.

294
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,039
You mean..

295
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,412
What do I have to do?

296
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,177
I've to tell you everything.

297
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,944
You've to kill Tanya with that gun.

298
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,118
What?

299
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,558
Kill..

300
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,391
Excuse me. Are you insane?

301
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,592
What do you mean kill her?
I'm not a murderer.

302
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,327
I won't kill anyone.

303
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,594
That means you want
go to jail for 10 years.

304
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,242
Listen, I don't know
what you think of me.

305
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,910
But I am not a murderer.

306
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,043
Yes, I made a mistake.
But.

307
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,512
I am not a bloody murderer.

308
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,545
And rather than spending
my life behind bars for murder..

309
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,315
...I would spend 10 years
in jail for my mistakes.

310
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,013
But I won't kill anyone.

311
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,086
No..l won't do it.

312
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,817
What do you think,
Johnny..l sent you there on a date?

313
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,923
Tanya's colleagues, hotel
staff..they've all seen you with her.

314
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,959
Whether you shoot her or not,
you're the prime suspect.

315
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,373
And no one will believe a fraud.

316
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,406
So do as I say.

317
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,437
Look, you won't be
jailed if you kill Tanya.

318
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,138
My man's with you.

319
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,645
He'll give you the key to a car.
Toyota, black color.

320
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,577
No.5708.

321
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,249
It's parked in the
Resorfs car park, for you.

322
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:37,855
There's a fake passport and
ticket for you in the glove-box.

323
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,221
If you want to escape
after killing Tanya..

324
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,424
...or do you want to let
her live and get behind bars.

325
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,160
The choice is yours.

326
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,534
L.. Hello!

327
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,366
Hello!

328
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:14,580
Hey“

329
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,353
Who are you?

330
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,461
How did you get in the room?

331
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,329
I didn't get in, I manifested here.

332
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,399
Do you know what that means?

333
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:27,993
I do.

334
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,504
What do you want now?

335
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:30,870
Bakshi sent you here, right?

336
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,174
No. The Acharya did.

337
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,435
The Acharya?

338
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:42,648
Who's this Acharya?
- Astrologer Acharya.

339
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,515
The one your mother went to..

340
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,090
...like always, to ask for help.

341
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:55,155
You mean..some astrologer sent
you by air to Thailand..to protect me.

342
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,298
Right.

343
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,328
Why? Are you some commando?

344
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,068
Not a commando.

345
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,629
I am a Jinn. Jinn.

346
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,568
Jinn! - Yes.

347
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,411
Hey man..drugs are
illegal in Thailand.

348
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,947
I don't know where you got hold of it.
But you're completely high.

349
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,118
Please find your room
and stop bothering me.

350
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,711
Just leave me alone.

351
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,164
What the"

352
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,466
What the f***..

353
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,368
What's going on?

354
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,305
Where am I?

355
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,407
Hello!

356
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,265
Hello!

357
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,576
Hello! - Hello!

358
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,374
What's all this?

359
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,208
You wanted alone,
so I brought you to the desert.

360
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,184
See..you're all alone here.

361
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,288
Hey boss..you hypnotized me,
didn't you?

362
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,048
What kind of mind-control is this?

363
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,387
<i>Aanardhan Nora.</i>

364
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:01,258
Copied all the answers
from Ruby in class 7..

365
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,094
...and scored first class in the exam.

366
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:08,095
Kissed Nita at the New Year
party..and never replied to her sms.

367
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,964
Bought a birthday gift for
your mom by selling your old T-Shirts.

368
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,507
That's a good thing.

369
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:18,539
You saw Kanik's wife with
someone else, and didn't tell Kanik.

370
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:19,673
That's a good thing too.

371
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,383
But..what you did with Mehul's wife..
- Enough.

372
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,685
Stop! Stop!

373
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,284
How do you know all this?

374
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,319
I told you I am a Jinn.

375
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,187
Jinn's know these things.

376
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,330
Now enjoy your 'Alone'..I'll
be seeing you. Okay.

377
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,130
Hey..man..
Mr. Jinn.. - Yeah.

378
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,366
I don't want this kind of 'Alone'.

379
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,205
Now do you understand.

380
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,372
...that I'm a Jinn sent the Acharya.

381
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,846
Then save me from all this.

382
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,051
That's not possible, it's destiny.

383
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,189
This is unbelievable.
- Am I unbelievable, or are you.

384
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,816
You're going to murder that girl,
and telling me.

385
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,885
What else do I do?
Go to jail.

386
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,495
Let them hang by the noose.

387
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,230
You might be jailed..or maybe not!

388
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,502
Bad deeds beget bad consequences.

389
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,471
It's easy to comment on the
storm while sitting on the shore.

390
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,235
I am not a Jinn, I am a human.

391
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,541
If I'm jailed, I cannot disappear
and reappear somewhere else.

392
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,881
My entire life will be ruined.

393
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,876
So..will you take someone else' life?

394
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,181
I am helpless..not a murderer.

395
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,327
I've an offer or you.

396
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,464
Offer? - Yeah.

397
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,535
Tread on both the paths.

398
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,431
Live both the lives.

399
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:59,114
You mean..
- I mean for the next 72 hours..

400
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,649
...you can live both the lives.

401
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,382
In one life,
see what happens when you kill Tanya.

402
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,352
And in the other, see what
happens when you don't kill her.

403
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,022
I had no option until now.

404
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,329
But now you're saying that
I have two options. - Correct.

405
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,031
I can live two lives. - Correct.

406
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,631
Somethings definitely
fishy about this offer.

407
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,465
There's nothing fishy.

408
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,337
Just three conditions.

409
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,375
First.

410
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:35,076
One life won't know anything
about your other life.

411
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:37,612
Second.

412
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:42,455
In both your lives,
you will forget our meeting.

413
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,621
And third and the most important.

414
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,632
If you die in any of the two lives..

415
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,635
"Then it's game over.

416
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:58,967
Fine..

417
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:00,666
Deal!

418
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,648
All the best.

419
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,518
Hi.

420
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,848
This bottle of wine was missing you.

421
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,086
So I thought I shouldn't keep you two.

422
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,954
Oh..l see.

423
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,988
Hand it over to me.

424
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,596
You see..it can't stay without me.

425
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,866
We'll have great fun when
three old friends sit along.

426
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,528
You mean great fun.

427
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,663
Atever.

428
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,002
Come on in.

429
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,673
I'll just get the glasses.

430
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,412
What are you doing?

431
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,143
I am sorry.

432
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,584
Really very sorry.

433
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,524
I don't have a choice.

434
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:33,628
Hi.

435
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,622
This bottle of wine was missing you.

436
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,031
So I thought I shouldn't keep you two.

437
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,602
Oh..l see.

438
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,966
Hand it over to me.

439
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,574
You see..it can't stay without me.

440
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,471
We'll have great fun when
three old friends sit along.

441
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,137
You mean great fun.

442
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,915
Whatever.

443
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:54,912
Come on in.

444
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,413
I'll just get the glasses.

445
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,456
What are you doing?

446
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,863
Trying to save your life.

447
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:11,864
Like this?

448
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,033
Look..Ramona Bakshi wants you dead.

449
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:19,471
And she.. - Who?

450
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,503
Ramona Bakshi who?

451
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,570
Listen, is this some kind of a joke?

452
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,542
You don't know Ramona Bakshi? - No.

453
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,018
Look, no need to lie to me.

454
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,382
I want to.. - Listen.
I don't know any Ramona Bakshi.

455
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,017
You're mistaken.

456
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,421
Mistaken? - Yes,

457
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,189
How can I be mistaken, you idiot?

458
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,060
I was sent here to kill you. - What?

459
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,700
Look, this woman
really wants you dead.

460
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,395
Why? - I Don't know.

461
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:53,371
All I know is that
his men are in this hotel..

462
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,704
...and they are keeping
an eye on you and me.

463
00:33:56,334 --> 00:34:00,180
And before they find out
that you're still alive, run away.

464
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,643
Just disappear.

465
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,413
What do you mean disappear?

466
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,453
I mean someplace where
no one can find you.

467
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,115
And you don't have much time,
hurry up.

468
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,986
Because..this is all
the help I can give you.

469
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,424
I am sorry.

470
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,128
Look after yourself.

471
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,429
Come on, let's go.

472
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,098
Did you kill her?

473
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,535
Yes, I did.

474
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,575
Show me.

475
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,011
What's to see?

476
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,347
I shot her in the head..

477
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,178
There's blood all around,
her brain's scattered everywhere.

478
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,678
Come on, let's go.
It'll make you puke. Come on.

479
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,759
You two stay here, I am coming.

480
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,341
Come on. Come on.

481
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,893
Hello, Royal Cliff Hotel.
May I help you?

482
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,898
There's been a murder in room 404.

483
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:00,999
What?

484
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,266
Hello!

485
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:09,810
Get into this car.

486
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:16,883
Hurry UP-

487
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:17,576
Get in, get in.

488
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,342
<i>M'</i>

489
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:46,880
Johnny, watch out.

490
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,376
Hey..what's wrong with you?

491
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,386
They're after us.

492
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,384
Move away.

493
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,184
<i>M'</i>

494
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,630
Who's the victim?

495
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,528
.3, yes.

496
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,197
Sir.

497
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:16,568
We found this in the AC ventilator,
in room no. 401.

498
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,467
401?-Yes.

499
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:25,344
Seems like the killer went from
404 to 401 after killing the victim.

500
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,548
I want to see all the CCTV footage.

501
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,455
Yes, sir.

502
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,120
And make sure you setup
police barricades everywhere.

503
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,195
Just play it once more.

504
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,198
Hey“

505
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:42,847
Sorry.

506
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,022
Get in. Get in.

507
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:19,351
What's wrong?

508
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:21,548
<i>M'</i>

509
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:24,450
Come on.

510
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,194
Come on.

511
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:38,138
This way. This way.

512
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,309
Let's go there.

513
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,350
Who are these people?
- They are Bakshi's men.

514
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,992
That giant Nobody..and the others..
somebody, anybody.. I don't know.

515
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,031
Johnny, I thought you had some brains.

516
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,539
But you're completely stupid.

517
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,331
What did you think?
We won't catch you.

518
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,068
Johnny, you need to decide now.

519
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,268
Would you prefer going
to jail or kill Tanya?

520
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,243
The choice is yours.

521
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,911
You need to shoot Tanya now.

522
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,249
I'm losing my patience, Johnny.

523
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,251
Shoot her Johnny, shoot her now.

524
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,203
Tanya, get down!

525
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,386
Johnny"

526
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:00,945
Shoot him!

527
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:06,993
Run!

528
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,522
Move aside.

529
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,232
Come on.

530
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,829
Get out..get lost.

531
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:49,595
Come on.

532
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:56,037
Let go.

533
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,145
Tanya!

534
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:14,653
It's coming.

535
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,656
Look Tanya, no one will stop their car
when they see me in this condition.

536
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:19,333
But we really need to stop this car.

537
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,970
Lift please.

538
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,134
Can I get a lift? - Okay. Come, come.

539
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,108
Thanks.

540
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:53,967
Quickly.

541
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,504
Oh God, you're bleeding.

542
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:03,940
<i>M'</i>

543
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,913
Where will we go?

544
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,276
I don't know.

545
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,591
I've a Thai friend.
She's gone out with her boyfriend.

546
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,960
We go there. It'll be safe there.

547
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,193
This is the house.

548
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,657
Please stop here.

549
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:43,310
Come.

550
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,726
I must make an important phone call..

551
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,951
To the Guinness Book of World Records.

552
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:27,922
Why?

553
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:32,993
This is definitely the World Record
for wearing the bathrobe so long.

554
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,866
9 hours and still counting.

555
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:41,104
Don't make me laugh,
let me concentrate.

556
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:44,071
First of all,
first-aid is not my cup of tea.

557
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,314
I can see that. - What do you mean?

558
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,944
You're cleaning my wounds
like you're making a painting.

559
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:51,742
Listen, Mister.

560
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:55,084
Don't expect some Florence
Nightingale to come look after you.

561
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:56,983
You will have to settle for me.

562
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:58,849
Correct, that's true.

563
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,018
Can I ask you question?

564
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:06,198
Flining with me..making friends..

565
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,196
Was it all a pan of your plan?

566
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,371
Was it all fake?

567
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:13,574
Honestly?

568
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:14,805
Yes..

569
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:17,541
It was a charade.

570
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:20,777
Thanks for being honest.

571
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,783
You know..l can never
flirt with a girl like you.

572
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,216
I see..am I that bad?

573
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,985
No, you're that good.

574
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,255
What?

575
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:38,059
I mean..no one can spend
a few days with a girl like you.

576
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,968
One can spend his entire life.

577
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,232
Few dates. time-pass. no!

578
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,101
You're a serious relationship girl.

579
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,078
Now I am more confused.

580
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,307
Why?

581
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,612
Thinking that there
can be a good boy..

582
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,346
...hidden behind that
cunning and drama-queen face.

583
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:04,392
Where is it?

584
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:07,925
Thank you.

585
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,404
Coffee. - Thank you.

586
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:24,605
Beautiful place.

587
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,010
Exactly.

588
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,047
I come here whenever I am stressed.

589
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,176
I feel relaxed.

590
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,490
Wow..you make really good coffee.

591
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:36,719
Really?

592
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:38,692
It's really bitter.

593
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,489
I knew it.

594
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:40,320
It's alright.

595
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:08,782
Hey man..

596
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,487
Why you looking so sad tonight?

597
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:15,622
You want some good time.

598
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,165
I got lots of good girls.

599
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:23,070
You want some boom-boom?

600
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:25,672
See this.

601
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,266
Are you Indian? Indian?

602
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,668
See..I've Indian girls.

603
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:32,277
See this.

604
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:35,809
Look at this. Look at this.

605
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:51,959
Hi, Johnny.

606
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,461
Johnny! Johnny!

607
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,033
Johnny! Johnny!

608
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,900
Where were you, Johnny? You
didn't come to office for two days.

609
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,940
What do you want?

610
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,803
You were supposed to send
me to India safe and sound.

611
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,206
Instead you handed
me over to the police.

612
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:15,210
Handed you over to the police?
India? What are you saying?

613
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:19,844
Remember..l killed Tanya
because you forced me.

614
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,856
Killed Tanya? Tanya who?

615
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,949
I don't know any Tanya.

616
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:27,962
If you think this charade
will save you, then you're wrong.

617
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,959
Because if I am caught,
you won't survive either.

618
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,223
I will tell the police everything.
- Tell them what?

619
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,860
That you blackmailed me.

620
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,336
You recorded my email..took
pictureseveryihing.

621
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:40,167
Emails..photographs.. Poof!

622
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,868
I made them all disappear.

623
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:47,974
Then you'll call the
police and tell them.

624
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,348
...that you were behind Tanya's murder.

625
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,250
And what if I don't do it?

626
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,389
Remember one thing..whether
I commit one murder or two"

627
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,822
...the punishment is still the same.

628
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,150
You wouldn't have come here..

629
00:51:58,215 --> 00:51:59,250
...if you were ready
to face punishment.

630
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,020
You didn't come here to kill me,
you came here to save yourself.

631
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,428
And that will never happen.

632
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:04,332
Really?

633
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,488
<i>M'</i>

634
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:25,232
Please let me go.

635
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:26,631
I won't tell anyone about this.

636
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,136
Let me go I'm begging you please.

637
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:29,761
Shut up!

638
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,168
Shut up! - Please..

639
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,409
Get in.

640
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,180
Stupid foreigners.

641
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:49,086
I maybe a foreigner, but not stupid.

642
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:50,590
You speak Hindi?

643
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:53,794
Hindi..and 19 different languages.

644
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,390
Rachael DCruz.

645
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,394
I work as an interpreter
for the Embassy.

646
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,532
And as far as you're concerned.

647
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,503
...you're a dog in every
language I can think of.

648
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,707
You're a dog.
Chain in French.

649
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,503
Pero in Spanish.. - Are you done?

650
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:28,491
You have a credit card? - What.

651
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,461
Take your credit card..and
go book us a room inside.

652
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:34,559
No, no, no..very bad idea.
You don't want me to use my..

653
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,339
You know what, I am a dog.

654
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:40,107
And the kind that's not faithful..

655
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,502
I won't repeat myself.

656
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:42,536
0K8?'-

657
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:44,534
Take it easy.

658
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:45,204
0K8?'-

659
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:47,339
Just go book the room. - Alright.

660
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:02,555
Hello.

661
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,895
Welcome to Seaside Sand Resort madam.

662
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,427
How may I help you today?

663
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:10,104
I need a room please,
you can charge me on this card.

664
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,473
Alright, just a simple room, madam.

665
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,575
Yes, let's keep it simple.

666
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,656
You said three victims on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

667
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:30,656
Come. - Yeah!

668
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:43,570
Sir.

669
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,252
Check the phone messages,
the call logs.

670
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,880
I want everything ASAP. - Yes sir.

671
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,988
Okay. Come.

672
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,306
Fine, fine.. Okay.

673
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:24,434
You see the CCTV camera over there.

674
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,038
I want all the footages from there,
Alright. All of it.

675
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,728
Call him in my office,
tomorrow morning.

676
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:50,403
Tanya!

677
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:54,934
Yeah.

678
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:56,233
Look..

679
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,437
This is Mrs. Bakshi.

680
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,875
I've never seen her before.

681
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:01,980
Think carefully.

682
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:04,815
You might have met her somewhere.

683
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,786
Maybe with your parents.

684
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:10,515
I lost my dad when I was quite young.

685
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,821
And my mom five years ago.

686
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,856
This can't be connected to my parents.

687
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,395
Office..regarding some work?

688
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:23,496
No!

689
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,231
Must be the pizza delivery guy,
I'll get it.

690
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,172
Ma'am, your pizza.

691
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:34,574
Thank you.

692
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:40,379
Thank you.

693
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,391
The Bangkok Police has issued
a look-out notice for this man.

694
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:49,991
The police believes this man
is heavily armed and can be dangerous.

695
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:52,188
Anyone approaching him
should be very cautious.

696
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,459
Johnny and a girl named Tanya..

697
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:58,296
Have killed three people,
hijacked a car.

698
00:59:58,461 --> 00:59:59,531
And are now on the run.

699
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:03,203
Anyone having any information
regarding these people..

700
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:09,111
...should contact the Bangkok
Crime Brach at 665437789.

701
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,378
There..come.

01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,045
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

703
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,597
Hey..this way.

Go on..go on.

Come on, go on. - And you.

Come on..Here.

Come, come.

Come on.

709

Hey you, stop-

Come on, fast.

711
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,062
Stop.

712

Come on, hurry up.

715
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:10,461
Come on.

716
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:17,101
Here.

717

Hey“

718
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,873
I think..cops are gone.

719
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,183
Come in.

720
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,182
ACP Pathan's here to see you.

721
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,116
He wants to ask you a few questions.

722
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:13,551
Send him in.

723
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,998
Ms. Bakshi,
have you ever seen this man?

724
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,504
No..never.

725
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,108
We recovered this man's cellphone.

726
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,578
And we found out that he made a lot
of calls to you on your direct line.

727
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,321
You asked me..whether
I saw this man or not.

728
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,989
Oh..damn!

729
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:49,459
Did you talk to him..on the phone?

730
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:53,660
He wanted to sell me some property.

731
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,430
That's what we were discussing.

732
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:56,900
PropelTV!

733
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:01,540
Ms. Bakshi, three days ago
this man called you 15 times..

734
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:04,009
...and you talked
to him for 55 minutes.

735
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,137
And then yesterday
he called you 12 times.

736
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,909
...and you talked
to him for 40 minutes.

737
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,540
And then" - You mean to say..

738
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,480
...I've some connection
with Sikander's death.

739
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:19,083
I want to say that..this entire
matter is about give and take.

740
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:20,518
What do you mean?

741
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,187
You're in trouble.

742
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,122
I can take some of your trouble.

743
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,726
...and you give me something in return.

744
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,364
Your broker's dead.

745
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:32,706
And now you're in
need of a new broker.

746
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,675
If you can get me
the property I want.

747
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:38,939
"Then I won't give
you any chance to complain.

748
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:42,448
You're giving me an
opponunityio serve you.

749
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:46,646
Now I will call you..after
I get my hands on the property.

750
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,155
Johnny..l have an idea.

751
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:39,970
Do you go into the boot
while I drive you out of here?

752
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:44,107
You think I am a fool.

753
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,342
That's what you think?

754
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:48,981
You're grinning. Is this fun to you?
You want to put me in the boot.

755
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:52,045
I'll take your dead body in the boot.
I am done.

756
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:55,419
I am done running scared.
I am done listening to people.

757
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:59,117
Now..l get out of here,
and I get out of life.

758
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:00,525
Get that?

759
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,476
What the hell is the
Police doing here? - Police..

760
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,251
I told you..credit
card was a bad idea.

761
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,184
What do you mean? - They traced me.

762
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,517
Who traced you?

763
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:37,461
The Embassy I work for their
Security and Intelligence Service.

764
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,397
...have been following
me for three days.

765
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:40,433
Why?

766
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:45,263
I know some secrets of our
country which I shouldn't know.

767
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,000
They don't want me alive.

768
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,651
You need my help, and I need yours.

769
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,045
I'll help you get out alive.

770
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:16,559
Come on.

771
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:49,060
"I love you..oh companion."

772
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:58,262
"Like your silky lips like the moon."

773
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:08,041
"Your naivety..and my mistakes."

774
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:18,055
"Together..it showered
all night on us."

775
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:23,814
"I love you..oh companion."

776
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:54,085
"There's restlessness in my heart."

777
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:58,857
"I've lost my slumber."

778
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:08,569
"Your memories..is
what clouds my mind."

779
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:17,649
"Now all I care about
are your eyes..and your arms."

780
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:27,193
"Your ..
and my silence."

781
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:37,536
"Together..it showered
all night on us."

782
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:43,427
"I love you..oh companion."

783
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:05,996
How long can we run?

784
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,767
Sooner or later we'll be caught.

785
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:11,328
What then?

786
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:13,302
Jail?

787
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:20,277
So this is the situation.

788
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,777
Bakshi sends me to kill you.

789
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:26,210
But you have no
connection with Bakshi.

790
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,416
Then how will the Police
believe that Bakshi is involved?

791
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:36,159
So we must first find out
why Bakshi wants to kill you.

792
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,998
Yeah..you're right.

793
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:42,193
But how will we find out?

794
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,033
I have an idea.

795
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,381
Are you sure you can hack her email?

796
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:58,949
Relax..l am a wiz when
it comes to computers.

797
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:00,849
Just get me to one, that's all.

798
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:08,323
Come on.

799
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,163
Are you sure this
is Bakshi's home? - Yeah.

800
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:18,098
We come here every
year for staff parties.

801
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,238
...when Bakshi says.

802
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:21,240
"Hello Johnny..how
you're having a good time."

803
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:23,643
Shall we?

804
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:25,639
Let's see what we can find inside?

805
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,470
Careful. This way.

806
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:55,532
What's Bakshi's email ID?

807
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,577
Baksi
bpocom

808
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:01,439
bpc.com

809
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:07,076
Now tell me..which email
would Bakshi definitely open?

810
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,081
Something that benefits her.

811
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:33,942
That's it.

812
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:38,341
Once Bakshi opens this email,
we'll be in her computer system.

813
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:30,367
We're in.

814
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,201
Come on, what's wrong?

815
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:40,446
This man..with Bakshi.

816
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:43,078
I've met him before.

817
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,377
This meanssomeone was keeping
an eye on Tanya for Bakshi.

818
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:51,081
But who sent this email?

819
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:56,456
Some detective agency
called Third Eye.

820
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:59,624
This email has been
sent from them to Bakshi.

821
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:05,395
So we'll have to go see this Mr.
Third Eye.

822
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:10,198
Who is he? Where did you meet him?

823
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:14,037
I don't know.
Three years ago, in my office.

824
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:15,237
Three years ago..

825
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:16,843
Are you sure?

826
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,150
Yeah, I am sure.

827
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,987
Yes, hello.
- Hello, sir. Tanya speaking.

828
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:30,121
Tanya, my God.
What's going on, my child?

829
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:34,432
Do you know what they are saying
about you on TV and News channels?

830
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:37,699
They are saying you're
on the run with a boy. Johnny.

831
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,564
And also that you two killed someone.

832
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:45,076
No, sir.
It's not like you think.

833
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,304
But it's true that
I am in lot of trouble.

834
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:50,642
And I need your help. - I understand.

835
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:52,976
Okay, Tanya, don't worry.

836
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,315
Do one thing.
Where are you now?

837
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:57,254
I am close to the Pataya Market.

838
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:01,093
Okay, meet me at Rama
Gate Bridge in 30 minutes.

839
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:01,684
Okay, sir.

840
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,496
Okay, thank you. I'll see you
at Rama Bridge in 30 minutes. - Hello.

841
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:07,729
Thank you sir. - Hi, is this
the Third-Eye Detective Agency?

842
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,560
Yes.

843
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,598
I actually got a
reference from a friend.

844
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,998
It's something very urgent.
Can I come and see you today?

845
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:20,006
Yes, the next one
hour would be perfect.

846
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:22,073
Thank you. Thank you.

847
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:32,347
I've already committed two murders.

848
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:35,561
And I won't have a problem
in committing a third one.

849
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:42,294
I get such threats every day.

850
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,238
You shot me..you Dam

851
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:01,146
How about I put you in the ICU next.
- No, no..

852
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:05,457
I'll tell you everything.
I'll tell you everything.

853
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,096
That man..

854
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:15,896
...you met in my office.

855
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,266
He's your papa..

856
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:21,932
Ashwini Bakshi.

857
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:26,238
Tanya..whatever existed
between you and your papa..

858
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:31,450
"They met only for few days.

859
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:37,615
After that..they never
met each other again.

860
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:43,655
In fact, the pregnancy..and
the day you were born..

861
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,595
...your mother Kavya,
hid everything from your papa.

862
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:54,465
But..before she died,
she told Ashwini everything.

863
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:59,569
But by then..he had
married a younger girl.

864
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:03,348
Ramona had taken over the business.

865
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:07,449
Ramona is the same woman
you know as Mrs. Bakshi.

866
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:09,383
And in this situation.

867
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:12,454
...He couldn't have accepted
you in front of the world.

868
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:18,224
But..he wanted to be there for you,
as a father.

869
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:26,062
If he's alive, I want to meet him.

870
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:31,978
I can't guarantee..whether
he'll be able to recognize you or not.

871
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:33,636
Meaning?

872
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:37,307
Your father's in advanced
stage of Alzheimer's.

873
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:41,621
He now lives in a nursing home.

874
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:54,923
So..it's about property.

875
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:01,702
Tanya didn't know that
her father's still alive.

876
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:04,434
And that she has a step-mother.

877
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,710
Or that she's going
to inherit millions.

878
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,412
She died without a reason.

879
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:14,016
Sad!

880
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,622
Rachael. - Yeah.

881
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,623
Take the hard disk
out of his computer.

882
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:20,723
No..no..no.

883
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:22,622
Please..please..

884
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:33,501
That hard disk has
information on all my clients.

885
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:35,741
Stop it..

886
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,366
It's got their secrets.

887
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,943
Please..please don't.

888
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,443
Take care of that foot.

889
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:50,456
Let's go.

890
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:35,234
Papa.

891
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:07,932
Kavya. .

892
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:12,766
Kavya, after all these years.

893
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:18,844
Papa, I am not Kavya.

894
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:22,440
I am Tanya. Your daughter Tanya.

895
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:27,917
Tanya? - Yes.

896
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,554
M'! Tanya?

897
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:39,264
Kavya, I know you're
worried for our daughter.

898
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:40,458
Right?

899
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:45,598
I've made things right.

900
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,537
I got our daughter a job.

901
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,805
I even changed my will.

902
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:57,916
I've transferred all my property and
business in the name of my daughter.

903
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:01,017
Ramona won't get a penny.

904
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:06,221
Here you go.

905
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:08,149
Thank you. - Thank you.

906
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:51,999
He was not alive for me.

907
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:54,603
I was alive for him.

908
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:58,202
Today he's alive for me..

909
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,479
"But I am not for him.

910
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:29,272
"May the dawn arise with you."

911
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:33,235
"And you be the first one."

912
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:37,139
"I talk about only you at night."

913
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:40,878
"And lose my slumber."

914
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:44,746
"And stay close to you."

915
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:48,517
"That's what I desire."

916
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:52,660
"I want to feel your fragrance."

917
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:56,190
"..and hold your hands forever."

918
01:24:56,624 --> 01:25:04,008
"You've become my heartbeats."

919
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:07,008
"My beloved.."

920
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:11,846
"My sweetheart"

921
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,020
"My beloved.."

922
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:15,918
"My sweetheart"

923
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:19,220
"You're so sweet."

924
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:23,024
"You're so sweet."

925
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,996
"You're so sweet."

926
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:49,649
"You're my safety..my refuge."

927
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:58,221
"You're my love.."

928
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:05,602
"I pray only for you."

929
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:13,435
"All I say to God.."

930
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:21,043
"May you always stay in my life."

931
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:24,386
"My beloved.."

932
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:29,059
"My sweetheart"

933
01:26:29,217 --> 01:26:31,254
"My beloved.."

934
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:33,162
"My sweetheart"

935
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:36,168
"You're so sweet."

936
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:40,131
"You're so sweet."

937
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:44,066
"You're so sweet."

938
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:49,243
"You're so sweet."

939
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:54,480
"My beloved.."

940
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:57,716
"My beloved.."

941
01:26:57,946 --> 01:27:00,722
"You're so sweet."

942
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:04,362
"You're so sweet."

943
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:10,094
ello.

944
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:11,403
Hello, mommy.

945
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:13,405
What? Who the hell is this?

946
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:16,941
The same guy who killed
your step-daughter for you.

947
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:18,539
Recognize me?

948
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:20,537
O Mommy.

949
01:27:21,202 --> 01:27:21,873
Shut up.

950
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:24,146
Now it's my turn to open my mouth.

951
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,381
...and you're asking me to shut up.

952
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:31,189
By the way, I was thinking about
handing myself over to the police.

953
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:33,892
If they ask I'll tell them.

954
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:37,457
"Mrs. Bakshi fored me,
she blackmailed me."

955
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:39,387
"What else could I do?
I had to kill her."

956
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,229
You have no evidence.

957
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,398
Evidence.

958
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:47,929
No one had a better
reason than you to kill her.

959
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:52,909
And anyway..the police will
definitely check your husband's Will.

960
01:27:53,468 --> 01:27:56,506
And then The Third
Eye Detective Agency.

961
01:27:57,338 --> 01:27:58,510
They will question them as well.

962
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:01,811
And they will definitely think"

963
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,389
...why an employee from
your office killed her.

964
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,120
I might get hanged..

965
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:11,329
"But you won't escape either.

966
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:13,488
What do you want?

967
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:18,134
I've many desires, mommy.

968
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:21,168
But for now..I've a deal for you.

969
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:26,334
Meet me at Thalia Congta
Airport in one hour.

970
01:28:26,934 --> 01:28:27,912
Come alone.

971
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:31,842
Actually..don't come alone.

972
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:33,884
Bring some Dollars along.

973
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:36,218
2 million

974
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:39,549
2 million?
Are you out of your mind? - No.

975
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:42,484
I am not out of my mind.

976
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:46,522
You're just out of luck..mommy.

977
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:49,326
I'll see you.

978
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:02,877
ACP Pathan.

979
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:04,780
Hello, sir Johnny speaking.

980
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:07,378
Sir, I am innocent.
I didn't kill anyone.

981
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:09,388
Why are you scared if you're innocent?

982
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:11,818
Handover yourself to the Police.

983
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:15,589
I will, sir.

984
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:21,128
But I just want to meet you once,
so that I can prove my innocence.

985
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,268
After that..I'll do as you say.

986
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:26,204
I just want to meet you once.

987
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:29,100
Hello.

988
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:31,501
I've your property, madam.

989
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,071
Tanya and Johnny are coming to see me.

990
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:36,314
In one hour.

991
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:38,817
Shall I bring them to you?

992
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,618
Kill them both.

993
01:29:41,943 --> 01:29:43,013
Fine with me.

994
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:36,160
Kill him!

995
01:32:29,677 --> 01:32:30,314
<i>M'</i>

996
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:25,274
No!

997
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:40,212
Sir, you missed the turn.

998
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:41,917
I think it was a left from there.

999
01:34:42,576 --> 01:34:44,112
I didn't miss it, mister.

1000
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:46,185
That was the Police Station.

1001
01:34:47,648 --> 01:34:49,389
I am taking you to the Crime Branch.

1002
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:02,668
They just talk rubbish all day.

1003
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:55,125
Tanya, hold on.

1004
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:00,596
Let go of the steering.

1005
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:05,433
Tanya, get out.

1006
01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:07,533
Come on, run.

1007
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:12,373
Careful.

1008
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:48,379
I'll take a ferry
to Taiwan and then India.

1009
01:36:49,336 --> 01:36:50,440
And you? - Me?

1010
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:54,582
I'll take a boat..and probably
cross the Coral Island.

1011
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:56,247
First to Vietnam.

1012
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:04,993
Johnny.

1013
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:19,109
Thank you so much
for everything, Johnny.

1014
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:22,141
I'll never forget you.

1015
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,450
I won't forget you either.

1016
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:46,603
The interpreter you're looking for.

1017
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:49,166
Rachael DCruz.

1018
01:37:51,265 --> 01:37:52,243
I know where she is.

1019
01:38:52,126 --> 01:38:52,934
Mister Jinn.

1020
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:54,973
You recognize me, bravo.

1021
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:04,081
You mean..my 72 hours are over.

1022
01:39:04,538 --> 01:39:06,313
Correct.

1023
01:39:09,643 --> 01:39:10,485
So now?

1024
01:39:11,712 --> 01:39:13,157
Look behind you.

1025
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:15,991
Both your lives are behind you.

1026
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:21,661
And now..which Johnny's
life would you like to lead?

1027
01:39:23,757 --> 01:39:27,170
Looking at him..he was
right doing the wrong thing.

1028
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:32,641
And looking at him..he was
wrong in doing the right thing.

1029
01:39:33,534 --> 01:39:38,449
Now..let's see how well you
understood life in these 72 hours?

1030
01:39:41,675 --> 01:39:43,450
It's difficult to understand life.

1031
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:47,282
So..which Johnny will you choose?

1032
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:57,395
I don't know about this Johnny.

1033
01:39:59,626 --> 01:40:02,163
He might die in the next few hours.

1034
01:40:04,698 --> 01:40:05,540
But him.

1035
01:40:08,802 --> 01:40:10,213
...he'll make it out.

1036
01:40:11,205 --> 01:40:12,309
He'll live for many years to come.

1037
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:19,824
The money he's carrying, is more
than he can make in his entire life.

1038
01:40:21,548 --> 01:40:25,086
But he doesn't have what he has?

1039
01:40:26,286 --> 01:40:27,094
What's that?

1040
01:40:29,723 --> 01:40:31,202
He's got love in his heart.

1041
01:40:32,793 --> 01:40:38,106
And it's better to have
loved..then not loved at all.

1042
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:46,112
So Mister. Jinn.

1043
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:49,487
I want to live..

1044
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:56,251
...as this Johnny.

1045
01:40:58,652 --> 01:41:00,131
Is that your final decision?

1046
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:01,258
Yes.

1047
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:03,357
Think about it.

1048
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:09,574
As soon as you choose one..the
other one will disappear.

1049
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:14,138
The events that occurred in that life,
will never have ever happened.

1050
01:41:14,201 --> 01:41:15,077
All over.

1051
01:41:15,135 --> 01:41:16,637
You won't get a second chance.

1052
01:41:19,673 --> 01:41:21,448
One chance is all you need to live.

1053
01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:26,283
As you wish..my master.

1054
01:42:18,499 --> 01:42:20,001
I should've run for
the Olympics instead.

1055
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:23,009
I would've won Gold for my country.

1056
01:42:24,037 --> 01:42:26,540
You're a good runner yourself.
You can definitely win Silver.

1057
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:31,550
Thank you, Johnny.

1058
01:42:35,949 --> 01:42:37,326
Thank you for everything.

1059
01:42:38,852 --> 01:42:42,095
If it wasn't for you..
- Ohh..the melodrama.

1060
01:42:45,626 --> 01:42:48,869
No need to thank me.
I didn't do anything for you.

1061
01:42:49,563 --> 01:42:50,701
I did it for me.

1062
01:42:51,298 --> 01:42:52,834
All selfish reasons.

1063
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:59,140
And since I've invested so much time,
I should get returns too.

1064
01:43:00,274 --> 01:43:01,548
So take it.

1065
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:03,818
Really?

1066
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:06,286
What are you waiting for?

1067
01:43:17,758 --> 01:43:18,998
The door's still closed.

1068
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:20,795
Knock..knock.

1069
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:24,171
Doesn't make a difference to you.
The window's open.

1070
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:25,104
No..

1071
01:43:26,099 --> 01:43:28,636
Now I'll always take
the straight path.

1072
01:43:29,303 --> 01:43:31,180
But yes..l need some help.

1073
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:34,352
You see..I've been
in Bangkok for five years.

1074
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:36,350
I made good money.

1075
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:41,388
And I've decided to go back
to my country and buy a home.

1076
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:43,251
And give a comfortable life to mom.

1077
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:47,822
But mom's already found a home for me.

1078
01:43:48,989 --> 01:43:50,024
With three bedrooms.

1079
01:43:50,857 --> 01:43:53,303
She says..one room
is only for the kids.

1080
01:43:55,696 --> 01:43:59,405
Having kids alone..
I don't see that happening.

1081
01:44:00,367 --> 01:44:03,837
So..l need your help.

1082
01:46:03,223 --> 01:46:04,327
Is this heaven?

1083
01:46:04,925 --> 01:46:07,269
No. you're in the hospital.

1084
01:46:16,336 --> 01:46:20,045
Mrs. Bakshi, who is the CEO
of the Backtor Corporation Ltd..

1085
01:46:20,107 --> 01:46:23,145
...was arrested today for the
attempted murder of a Indian girl..

1086
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:24,314
...by the name of Tanya.

1087
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:26,688
While investigation,
Bangkok Police came to know..

1088
01:46:26,747 --> 01:46:28,727
"About the deal between Mrs.
Bakshi and ACP Pathan.

1089
01:46:28,949 --> 01:46:32,260
The early repons say that this
could be a case of family rivalry..

1090
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:34,265
...as Tanya is her step-daughter.

1091
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:37,335
You must be wondering
how this happened?

1092
01:46:37,557 --> 01:46:38,433
Correct?

1093
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:41,298
Tanya, my throat's dry.

1094
01:46:41,762 --> 01:46:43,708
Can I have some juice please? - Sure.

1095
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:51,774
Remember when you were
fleeing from the resort.

1096
01:46:52,372 --> 01:46:54,147
And that old woman
was crossing the street.

1097
01:46:54,207 --> 01:46:56,346
Tanya screamed, you hit the brakes.
And she survived.

1098
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:03,789
Yes. I remember.

1099
01:47:04,684 --> 01:47:09,133
Unfonunatelyihe Johnny which
chose the life when he killed Tanya..

1100
01:47:09,556 --> 01:47:11,035
...she never screamed.

1101
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:12,664
So he ran over that woman.

1102
01:47:18,665 --> 01:47:20,144
Poor woman was lying on the road.

1103
01:47:21,034 --> 01:47:22,445
A taxi-driver was passing-by.

1104
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:27,684
He picked her up, put her in his taxi.
And was taking her to the hospital.

1105
01:47:30,577 --> 01:47:32,784
Some police officers
were chasing a terrorist.

1106
01:47:34,448 --> 01:47:36,018
Unfortunately the
taxi came in the middle.

1107
01:47:38,752 --> 01:47:40,163
...and the taxi escaped.

1108
01:47:40,754 --> 01:47:42,461
Do you know what his plan was?

1109
01:47:43,356 --> 01:47:46,394
To plant a bomb in a passenger ferry.

1110
01:47:49,062 --> 01:47:53,067
The same ferry in which
Johnny was fleeing from Thailand.

1111
01:48:12,452 --> 01:48:17,697
If you had chosen that life,
then you would've been dead.

1112
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:27,003
But Tanya was with you, she screamed.

1113
01:48:27,334 --> 01:48:29,473
You hit the brakes,
so the old lady survived.

1114
01:48:30,237 --> 01:48:32,615
The taxi driver didn't stop.
And there was no accident.

1115
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,183
And the police caught the terrorist.

1116
01:48:36,943 --> 01:48:39,116
Do you know what the terrorist
said during interrogation?

1117
01:48:39,646 --> 01:48:42,252
That some police officers
were also pan of this conspiracy.

1118
01:48:51,691 --> 01:48:53,534
And he even took Pathan's name.

1119
01:48:55,428 --> 01:48:57,533
The Police taped Pathan's phone..

1120
01:48:58,064 --> 01:49:01,443
...and heard the entire conversation
between Bakshi and Pathan.

1121
01:49:03,136 --> 01:49:07,983
And the police got evidence
of their crime and your innocence.

1122
01:49:09,276 --> 01:49:10,482
Can I tell you something?

1123
01:49:12,078 --> 01:49:16,390
Future is nothing..but
a outcome of our decision.

1124
01:49:17,517 --> 01:49:18,689
Make the right decision.

1125
01:49:19,586 --> 01:49:21,293
And your future will be right.

1126
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:23,693
Understand.

1127
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:29,263
Bye, see you.

1128
01:49:29,663 --> 01:49:30,664
Thank you.

1129
01:49:31,464 --> 01:49:32,534
Welcome.

1130
01:49:36,002 --> 01:49:37,037
Mr. Jinn.

1131
01:49:37,437 --> 01:49:39,815
What? What happened?

1132
01:49:43,076 --> 01:49:45,352
That girl..Tanya..

1133
01:49:48,081 --> 01:49:49,151
Shall I marry her?

1134
01:49:57,123 --> 01:49:58,500
Why are you asking me?

1135
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:02,572
Its marriage after all, I am scared.

1136
01:50:03,363 --> 01:50:05,639
Everyone's scared when
it comes to marriage.

1137
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:08,268
Yeah, but I was thinking.

1138
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:11,446
Can you make an arrangement where.

1139
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:14,251
...in one life I can see
what happens if I marry her..

1140
01:50:14,407 --> 01:50:15,681
...and in another I
can see what if I don't?

1141
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:24,688
Good idea.
