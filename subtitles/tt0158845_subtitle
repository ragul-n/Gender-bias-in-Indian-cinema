1
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:05,790
"There was no today, there
wasn't a yesterday..."

2
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:11,494
"There was no problem, and no solution"

3
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:14,485
"There was however the fruit"

4
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:20,820
"lt's a forbidden fruit, they were told"

5
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:32,161
"Adam and Eve lived in paradise"

6
00:01:49,595 --> 00:01:54,527
"They were tempted.
They ate the fruit"

7
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:05,853
"A fire raged... and the
devil in them awakened"

8
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:17,054
"Things they should never
have done...they did"

9
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:28,055
"Adam and Eve lived in paradise"

10
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:50,921
"God was angered.
They were accused"

11
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:56,587
"They had lived in paradise.
And now they were thrown out"

12
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:05,254
"They were thrown down..."

13
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:13,256
"and the fruit followed them"

14
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,127
"Centuries passed by..."

15
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:19,086
"but the fruit would not stop following them"

16
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:29,796
"People still cite their example..."

17
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:41,117
"Adam and Eve now live in this world"

18
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,321
Hey mister. Can't you see?
Do you have buttons for eyes?

19
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,985
Sorry, did you break a button?
- Shut up, insolent man!

20
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:11,988
lnsolent? That's wonderful

21
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:18,988
You aren't hurt, are you?
- Leave the one l've injured

22
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:21,988
l'll take care. Go on

23
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,861
How will l go home now?
- Come, l'll drop you

24
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:36,358
Come on...
- No, l'm not going with you

25
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:38,687
lt's time for peak hour traffic.
- l said l won't!

26
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,522
They are the modern day Adam and Eve.
The hero and heroine of our story

27
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:51,019
Municipal roads do come in handy
when they have to meet each other

28
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:54,857
See this? After the collision came a fight

29
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,362
But not to worry.
Love follows a fight

30
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:11,896
Wicked one! You were caught in my wheel

31
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:17,063
What would you lose if you were
entangled around my neck?

32
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:38,429
Now let me write my diary

33
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,423
My cycle broke.
But the girl survived

34
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:04,255
What a girl!

35
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:09,285
She said, "Let's go to the police station"

36
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:17,122
And l said, "Lovers don't go to police stations"

37
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:20,797
She laughed

38
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:29,457
Laugh, she did. But when
is she going to fall for me?

39
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:38,460
Maybe at Harish's wedding

40
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:44,993
The moth and the flame might clash yet again

41
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,664
lt's the same locality

42
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:00,322
So Ranjit was right

43
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:03,994
At Harish's wedding, he ran into Sharda again

44
00:07:07,564 --> 00:07:11,156
Ranjit saw Sharda.
And Sharda saw Ranjit

45
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,192
Ranjit smiled. So did Sharda

46
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:20,362
And they were lost in each other's eyes

47
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,031
Brother, the ceremony is over.
Let's have something more now

48
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:49,557
Sure? But it would be fun if one
of the bride's friends joined in

49
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,731
Sisters...

50
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:57,392
Ladies. Will someone play the cymbals
to the melody of the harmonium?

51
00:07:57,631 --> 00:07:59,564
Of course!

52
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,760
"The girl on the cycle..."

53
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:47,597
"on the roads..."

54
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:54,464
"she gave me a loving abuse"

55
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:59,294
"The girl on the bicycle..."

56
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,291
"With an abuse, l let you go..."

57
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:19,132
"Madmen like you..."

58
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:22,791
"deserved to have their heads broken"

59
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:27,664
"With an abuse, l let you go"

60
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:47,998
"She's a moon like beauty..."

61
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:56,324
"from her veil..."

62
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,532
"this is a silken piece"

63
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,691
"You're giving her a bad name..."

64
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:25,194
"Why don't you name her?"

65
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,858
"Are you scared of a beating?"

66
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:06,225
"On the roof, there's a crow..."

67
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,759
"for that day, l wait..."

68
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,765
"When you will consent"

69
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:34,263
This union is not possible"

70
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,962
"l've done my B.A.,..."

71
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:49,801
"l've haven't plugged my matriculation"

72
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:54,801
"Our union is not possible"

73
00:11:57,034 --> 00:12:00,466
"Well said, girl..."

74
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:05,293
"Well said, boy"

75
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:24,333
"What is your name?"

76
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:32,667
"You look old"

77
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:39,832
"And you're still unmarried?"

78
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:44,663
"What is your name?"

79
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:54,697
"Had you grown up soon..."

80
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:03,363
"may be you yourself..."

81
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:10,193
"you yourself would have been
the mother of my children"

82
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:14,867
"lf only you had grown up soon"

83
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,230
A sparkle in the eyes, a thumping heart...

84
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:28,230
and silence on the lips

85
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:31,060
This is what Romeo went through
when he first fell in love

86
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:34,901
What's up, brother?
You're in a romantic mood today

87
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:41,897
l'm in love.
- ln love?

88
00:13:42,802 --> 00:13:44,734
With that girl at the cymbal?

89
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:55,925
My word! How far have you got?
- lt's 53 per cent done already

90
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,760
53 per cent? What does that mean?
- l mean...

91
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:03,767
the 53 per cent on my side is okay.
lt's she who has to give the nod now

92
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:11,097
Get it wrapped up, brother.
- That's what l'm thinking about

93
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:14,427
You mustn't think too much.
Just pounce on it

94
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:16,935
Pounce on it...?
- Pounce on it!

95
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,430
How...? l've got it!

96
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,297
You...? l mean...

97
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,800
That's okay. We have to
stop being formal some day

98
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,959
So why waste time? Truth
is, l'm madly in love with you

99
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:45,132
l know you're in love with me too.
- How?

100
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:47,631
That night when our cycles collided...

101
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,462
it was our hearts actually
- But...

102
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:53,296
No buts. ln the matters of the
heart, such things are not allowed

103
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:59,294
No need to worry. l've said
the right thing, haven't l?

104
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:02,828
We ought to get married now.
- Married?

105
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:07,333
Oh yes. Who will discuss it? You?
Or do you have an elder at home?

106
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,160
Daddy...
- First class! Where is he?

107
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:19,827
No... l might as well fold hands first

108
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,001
Who are you?
- Ranjit

109
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:26,493
l'm 28. My net salary is 633
rupees. l have a permanent job

110
00:15:27,236 --> 00:15:32,169
Let me come to the main thing
now. l'm in love with Sharda.

111
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:34,197
She loves me too

112
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:37,528
But l was never...
- lt's clear. No confusion

113
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:40,863
We want to get married
and seek your permission

114
00:15:41,102 --> 00:15:43,034
Married?
- Yes. l'm worthy of it in every way

115
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:47,532
l have no demands except Sharda.
No dowry, nothing. Only Sharda

116
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:52,535
You just can't say no, daddy.
So give me your blessings

117
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:20,903
Take it away.
Take it away, l say!

118
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,402
Will you guys start dancing,
or must l get down?

119
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,602
Brides get to look nice at weddings.
And the men look like clowns!

120
00:16:57,338 --> 00:17:02,269
Don't you even know what
happens on a nuptial night?

121
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,432
This is my first wedding. l'd have
known if it was my second or third

122
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,761
You used to be a brave guy.
So what's happened to you now?

123
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:12,770
l don't know what has happened to me

124
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:15,470
l'll explain

125
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:22,463
The first night, the nuptial night,
is a night of delicate moments

126
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:25,295
lf you make the slightest bit of mistake,...

127
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:29,470
you'll regret it all your life.
- Listen to me, guys

128
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:32,962
Read this book and victory is yours

129
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:35,804
What is this?

130
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:38,136
A book of dos and don'ts

131
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:41,295
Read it!

132
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:45,300
lf l start reading this book now,
it'll be dawn by the time l finish

133
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:49,660
He's right. lf he reads the book,
what else is he going to do?

134
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:54,668
Let all this be. l'll show you.
Just watch me

135
00:17:58,571 --> 00:18:04,162
On the nuptial bed, your wife
will be sitting like this

136
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:09,330
Shy and blushing.
And hesitant

137
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:14,161
Your first lesson. You must
walk into the room

138
00:18:14,638 --> 00:18:17,832
All alone?
... l'm only asking

139
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:22,204
And then?
- Like Emperor Akbar

140
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,871
The fragrance of the rose, you must inhale

141
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:32,871
The fragrance of the rose...
One moment. Let me note it down

142
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,870
Sure, note it down

143
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:39,696
ln which hand must the rose be?
- ln the right hand

144
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:42,870
Emperor Akbar held the rose
in his right hand. Like this

145
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:50,037
The rose in the right hand.
Like Emperor Akbar

146
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,533
l've written that down.
And then?

147
00:18:53,938 --> 00:19:00,735
For the first time, your wife
will look at you shyly

148
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:05,564
Shyly, she will look at me

149
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:11,233
Present the rose to her.
And say, "lt's only for you"

150
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:14,733
l'll say that. And then?

151
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:19,230
Your wife will be shy. She'll
blush and slip away a little

152
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:26,234
Slowly, take her hand,
move closer to her and...

153
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:32,764
your first line. "Darling, what
distance is this from me?"

154
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,270
"What distance...?"

155
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:38,104
Your left arm must reach her
shoulder by then. Don't mess it up

156
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:42,433
While l speak these lines...?
- Yes, while you speak the lines

157
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:47,101
Lines and action... together

158
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:51,437
And then?
- Slowly...

159
00:19:52,505 --> 00:20:00,461
press her shoulder and pull
your heartthrob to yourself

160
00:20:02,706 --> 00:20:04,637
Pull her to me...

161
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:10,962
For the first time now,
you will have to kiss her

162
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:14,634
What if she hides her
head between her knees?

163
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:19,468
That's okay. Lift her head
with your right hand and kiss her

164
00:20:19,873 --> 00:20:23,306
But the rose... no, l gave it away!

165
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:31,135
After you have kissed her, give her a betel-leaf

166
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:35,501
Where will a betel-leaf come from?
- lt'll all be there

167
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:38,504
Betel-leaf, water... and rejuvenating milk!

168
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:42,005
After that, she'll feed you a betel-leaf

169
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:46,997
Me? l don't want a betel-leaf. l don't like it

170
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:53,502
That's your chance to take
her elbow and sink into her

171
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:57,172
She'll be in your embrace!

172
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,501
Then?
- What else?

173
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,672
All those worldly affairs.
- Worldly affairs, l see

174
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:05,172
Remember one thing, brother

175
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:09,194
He who gets the cat on the
first night, enjoys his life

176
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:13,940
Don't let her weigh you down.
- Oh no. l'll weigh her down

177
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,871
That's not what l meant!

178
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,701
l spoke about something else

179
00:21:22,107 --> 00:21:25,367
Have you learnt nothing in college?
- Listen...

180
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:28,698
Don't melt under his touch

181
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:32,368
Tease him a bit. Don't simply go into his arms

182
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:36,369
Turn your face away,
when he tries to kiss you

183
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,972
What are you scared of?

184
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:44,898
Very scared, are you?

185
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:51,407
l'll be sitting on the bed when
he arrives. l'll die of fright

186
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,402
Allah! l was frightened too
Know what l did?

187
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,902
l didn't sit on the bed at all.
- So what did you do?

188
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,731
What else? lt was a moonlit night.
Before my husband could arrive...

189
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:06,566
l opened all the windows.
l just looked at the moon

190
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:10,731
When he came in, l acted as
if he hadn't turned up at all

191
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:17,936
He walked up to me and stood beside me.
For a long time, we watched the moon

192
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:23,598
lt took some time for me to breathe easily

193
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,772
My fear had vanished!

194
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,273
You must do just that

195
00:22:30,673 --> 00:22:32,935
lt's a Moonlit night.
Just don't be afraid

196
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,341
You must do just that

197
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:38,603
lt's a Moonlit night.
Just don't be afraid

198
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:40,269
lt's on this night that a
woman's life is fulfilled

199
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,931
A night when you begin to
give yourself unto each other...

200
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:48,302
and share your joys and happiness

201
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,966
The bed's empty.
Hey buddies...

202
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:08,306
There's no mention of this

203
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:11,465
A shaky start!

204
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:34,003
Like Emperor Akbar, inhale
the fragrance of the rose

205
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:04,370
The Moon? There's no
charm to the Moon anymore

206
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:06,872
Scientists have ruined it
all by landing on there

207
00:24:12,774 --> 00:24:18,366
l think, we ought to go to the bed.
We'll talk there

208
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:23,366
ln fact, that's where it must all begin.
- No, it's okay here

209
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:25,706
Here?
- Yes

210
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:33,237
l think that would be okay.
How can we stand and talk?

211
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:35,573
On the bed...

212
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,441
Say, "lt's only for you"
- Say ?

213
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:20,271
No... it's only for you!

214
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:28,441
lt has your fragrance.
- What? My fragrance?

215
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:50,975
She has slipped away

216
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,967
Darling, what distance between you and me?

217
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:09,505
Where am l at a distance?
- Where...?

218
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:12,174
You're close enough

219
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:34,175
What happened?
- Nothing. My first marriage, you see

220
00:26:34,742 --> 00:26:36,675
l was a bit confused

221
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:41,043
Yes, this is all right

222
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,201
For the first time, you will have to kiss her

223
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,537
Where's the betel-leaf?
- Betel-leaf?

224
00:26:54,776 --> 00:26:57,538
Do you want to eat a betel-leaf?
- No, l don't eat it at all

225
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:00,042
Do you want one?
- No

226
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,734
Damn it! lt's morning already!

227
00:27:16,477 --> 00:27:18,408
We've wasted our time in the nitty-gritty!

228
00:27:19,142 --> 00:27:21,075
l realise today!
- What?

229
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:26,900
Whatever night it is... one
must use his own ways!

230
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:36,742
The one who gets the cat on
the first night, enjoys his life

231
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,901
The first night has passed.
l have yet to get the cat

232
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,243
Never mind. l'll get the cat early in the morning

233
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:49,767
Missus!
- Coming

234
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,276
What are you laughing for?
Show it to me.

235
00:28:00,843 --> 00:28:03,106
Don't touch it. lt's my personal diary

236
00:28:03,844 --> 00:28:05,776
l'm reading some advise my friends gave me

237
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:10,775
They say, the one who gets the cat
on the first night, enjoys his life

238
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,101
How d'you get the cat on the first night?

239
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,209
There is a way. They've told me.
- Show it to me

240
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,771
l'll show you nothing!
Just do as l ask you to!

241
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,976
Missus!
- Yes, my lord?

242
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:23,802
l need a cup of hot tea the moment l awaken

243
00:28:24,044 --> 00:28:25,805
Or else...
- Or else?

244
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:28,975
You'll have tea early every morning!
- Hot tea

245
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:31,643
Hot tea

246
00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:38,975
Missus...
- Yes?

247
00:28:39,544 --> 00:28:41,635
When l have my bath and
come out of the bathroom...

248
00:28:41,878 --> 00:28:44,969
l must find my clothes on a hanger. Or else...

249
00:28:45,544 --> 00:28:47,476
Or else...?
You'll find them!

250
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,676
Missus...
- Yes, my Lord?

251
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,676
Lunch ought to be served at the table at 1 :3

252
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:12,836
Or else...
- Else...? No, don't do that!

253
00:29:21,744 --> 00:29:23,677
At 1 :3?

254
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:37,043
And dinner exactly at 9:33.
Else...

255
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:04,233
The cat...? The cat's been cooked and had

256
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,239
Missus...

257
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:13,405
l've got to go out early tomorrow

258
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:17,572
l must get hot water exactly at 5:33

259
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:20,243
Or else...?
- Or else what?

260
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:28,070
Or l'll bathe with cold water

261
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:40,611
This is how you get the cat?
- l don't know

262
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:44,938
But the tomcat sure got killed in the process

263
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:52,436
Are you ready, son?
- Yes, Mummy

264
00:30:53,012 --> 00:30:55,603
Wore your shoes?
- Had your breakfast?

265
00:30:55,845 --> 00:30:58,437
l'm doing it.
- Have you done your homework?

266
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:06,441
Take it easy. What's the hurry?
- They're small. Get me a new pair

267
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:09,474
He'll buy you one.
Here's your lunch-box

268
00:31:09,712 --> 00:31:11,644
Run along. You're getting late for school

269
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:14,469
Papa, Mummy... a kiss

270
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:20,305
Come on

271
00:31:25,212 --> 00:31:28,303
He's taken after you.
- No way

272
00:31:29,045 --> 00:31:32,307
l'm a husband who bathes
with cold water

273
00:31:32,712 --> 00:31:34,644
Not one who says "or else" ?
- Not at all

274
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:37,807
l'm a henpecked man.
- Really?

275
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:42,835
Let me go. l've got work to do.
- Let's do it, or else...

276
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:45,178
Or else, what...?

277
00:31:45,412 --> 00:31:47,345
Or l'll read the paper

278
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:58,511
Could you give me my watch please?

279
00:32:20,614 --> 00:32:23,546
l've got to wake up early tomorrow.
- Got to go somewhere?

280
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,870
No, the G.M. is arriving
from London tomorrow

281
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:30,537
The flight lands at 5 a.m.
- There's enough time for that

282
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:34,542
So remind me even if l forget.
Okay?

283
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:41,037
l'll remember. But you seem
to be forgetting something

284
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:43,545
l...?

285
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:47,413
Oh yes!

286
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:51,073
l can't help it. l'm always
thinking of you at office...

287
00:32:51,312 --> 00:32:53,574
and about the office at home.
See you

288
00:32:54,145 --> 00:32:55,076
That way

289
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:57,411
Why not here?
- Come on

290
00:33:04,146 --> 00:33:08,239
Why have you brought me from here?
- Get this heap of junk repaired

291
00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:12,576
Does it look good for the sales
manager to travel by a taxi?

292
00:33:13,312 --> 00:33:16,074
But l've just spent 5333
rupees on the telephone

293
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,912
And now... okay. l'll have it
repaired in a couple of days

294
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,772
Wait... you unbuttoned it again.
Strange man!

295
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:29,779
May l go now?
- Go ahead

296
00:34:25,547 --> 00:34:27,843
The officer has arrived.
- Has he? All right

297
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:34,679
So let's go

298
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:42,673
Life without a wife is no good

299
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,175
A bed without a wife pierces the heart

300
00:34:46,915 --> 00:34:51,176
Nice couplet. Whoever wrote it...
- l wrote it!

301
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:55,343
lt was written in the night

302
00:34:55,914 --> 00:34:57,846
lt smacks of loneliness.

303
00:34:58,248 --> 00:35:02,544
You can say that.
You have a wife and kid

304
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,872
And l'm still a bachelor

305
00:35:05,282 --> 00:35:07,713
But l have decided.
- What?

306
00:35:07,948 --> 00:35:11,710
lf l don't find a girl, l'll marry a widow

307
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:15,706
Don't worry about that.
Any girl you marry...

308
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,709
Will soon be a widow.
- What?

309
00:35:17,948 --> 00:35:21,538
Any couplet on that?
- There is. But it stinks

310
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:31,539
What are you laughing about?
- This is a funny book

311
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:35,573
What does it say?
- lt says...

312
00:35:41,314 --> 00:35:43,906
Let's talk after you have laughed.
- lt says...

313
00:35:45,248 --> 00:35:48,238
When a husband and wife
love each other very much...

314
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:54,081
there comes a time when they
start looking like each other

315
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:59,244
Like brother and sister
- Now don't take me for a brother!

316
00:36:00,648 --> 00:36:02,910
There's more.
- Forget it, sis

317
00:36:03,148 --> 00:36:06,581
Listen! lt says, after seven years of marriage...

318
00:36:06,982 --> 00:36:10,937
something special develops in
the man and woman's personality

319
00:36:11,515 --> 00:36:14,605
The woman starts depending
more and more on her husband

320
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:18,773
And the man looks for a change.
- lt's right too.

321
00:36:19,015 --> 00:36:21,447
The seven-year itch.
- What?

322
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:26,611
Yes. l have always depended on you

323
00:36:27,516 --> 00:36:30,948
And in these seven years, you
have started depending on me too

324
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:35,607
The one-sided love is now two-sided

325
00:36:38,015 --> 00:36:40,982
But why do we need this
book between our love?

326
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,644
Don't be a devil!
- Why not?

327
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:49,811
You've got to be at the
airport at 5 in the morning

328
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,639
You've got to receive the G.M.

329
00:36:51,882 --> 00:36:56,973
5 a.m. ! ls that any time for a plane to land?

330
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,314
Set an alarm for 4, will you?

331
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:06,813
lt's dead.
- What?

332
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:12,973
This has gone to sleep too.
- lt fell down this morning

333
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:16,840
What now?
- How will we know what time it is?

334
00:37:17,748 --> 00:37:19,681
Didn't you know all day that
this clock had stopped?

335
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:22,347
Why will l look at a watch?
You're my timekeeper

336
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:26,011
Really? Now look at my face
and tell me what time it is

337
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:28,848
lt's 12 !
- What a joke!

338
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,515
What am l to do now?

339
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:36,347
Give me that harmonium

340
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:39,681
Harmonium?
- Just get it

341
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,711
Brought it?
- Here it is

342
00:37:49,949 --> 00:37:50,506
What are you going to do?
- Just watch

343
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:23,745
"O Protector of the world..."

344
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:29,408
"Awaken those who sleep"

345
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:35,082
"And tell me what time it is"

346
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:39,912
"O Protector of the world..."

347
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:44,909
"O Protector..."

348
00:38:56,016 --> 00:38:57,778
Ranjit, you get started in
the middle of the night?

349
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,938
What middle? lt's not very late

350
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:03,943
lt's ten minutes past one.

There you are. 1 :13

Which way are you headed?
- Any way you say

355
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:48,483
Could you drop me at Central Market?
- That's where l'm going too

00:39:54,383 --> 00:39:58,315
What do you call that dress?

lt suits you

358
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:09,680
The red and white combination
suits you perfectly too

359
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:14,846
That's what my husband says too.
- Your husband?

00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:27,850
Actually, l'm headed the other day

361
00:40:28,418 --> 00:40:30,349
You want to go to the
Central Market, right?

362

You'll get bus No. 84 from here.
lt'll take you to Central Market

363

Here's Rupees29, madam.
- Oh yes. Today's pay-day!

00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:41,614
What's that?

368
00:41:42,018 --> 00:41:44,450
l go with love, and come back with love

00:41:44,852 --> 00:41:46,783
That's how it should be

370
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:49,280
There's something l can't understand.
- What?

371
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:52,450
When l leave the house,
you button up my coat

372
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:57,447
And when l return, you unbutton it.
- That's because you're free at home

373
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:00,612
And not outside. Get it?
- l get it

374
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,443
l'm free at home, not outside

375
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:07,280
You mean, no eying anyone...?

Daddy! ls that for me?
- Yes, son. lt's for you

377

Wife or money?

378
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:49,344
Zorro Master, put that away

379
00:42:50,086 --> 00:42:53,018
Please spare my wife.
You can take all my money

380

"Whether we can sing or not...
we must sing"

386
00:43:32,353 --> 00:43:36,375
"Whether we can sing or not,
we ought to sing"

387
00:43:37,285 --> 00:43:41,377
"ln cold water, my son,
we must bathe"

388
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:46,214
"Whether we can sing or not,
we ought to sing"

389
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,246
"Clap your hands, my son..."

390
00:44:00,253 --> 00:44:02,082
"l'm about to sing the qawwali"

391
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,581
"Let's play the ektara.
And let's turn on the shower"

"Aren't we going to the movies?
Aren't you coming out?"

395
00:44:22,153 --> 00:44:26,586
"Mummy ought to be called in too"

00:44:26,987 --> 00:44:31,784
"Mummy ought to be called in too"

397
00:44:32,621 --> 00:44:36,610
"Whether we can sing or not,
we ought to sing"

398
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,619
"Whether we can sing or not,
we ought to sing"

399
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,952
"You are my handcuff"

400
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:52,451
"Why're you standing away?"

401
00:44:52,853 --> 00:44:57,114
"Come and bathe... and sing with us"

402
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:02,315
"What are you trying to save?
We're partners in joy and sorrow"

403
00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:07,481
"Lay off.
You have drenched my sari"

404
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,152
"What a shameless man you are"

405
00:45:10,554 --> 00:45:12,815
"You're no better than a kid"

406
00:45:13,654 --> 00:45:17,483
"Mummy only needs an excuse to start a fight"

407
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,151
"Shut up, devil!"

408
00:45:19,387 --> 00:45:22,648
"Mummy only needs an excuse to start a fight"

409
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,479

411
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,012
"Come off those high notes"

412
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:45,519
"Spare my life, please"

413
00:45:46,088 --> 00:45:48,020
"This song is yet incomplete"

414
00:45:48,588 --> 00:45:50,519
"So let's complete it"

415
00:45:51,255 --> 00:45:55,517
"Don't make a noise.
The neighbours are hearing us"

416
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:58,016
"Tell the neighbours..."

417
00:45:58,753 --> 00:46:00,686
"not to peep into our windows"

418
00:46:01,255 --> 00:46:05,517
"There was a knock on the door.
Looks like someone has come"

419
00:46:06,255 --> 00:46:10,550
"Tell him that l'll be there...

424
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:35,220
"My son, in cold water,
we ought to bathe"

425
00:46:36,122 --> 00:46:40,247
"ln cold water,
we ought to bathe"

My name is Nirmala Deshpande.

00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:10,151
You just told me.
Nirmala... nice name

431
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:12,986
Please sit down

432
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:18,822
Where were you till now?
- Pardon me?

433
00:48:19,722 --> 00:48:24,678
Where have you been working?
- l was studying at Bhavan's college

434
00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:28,021
So this is your first job?
- Yes, sir

435
00:48:31,256 --> 00:48:34,848
Why did you have to take up a job?
- Circumstances, sir

436
00:48:35,756 --> 00:48:38,348
You mean you're basically not a working girl

437
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:41,521
Basically, no lndian girl is a working girl, sir

438
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:44,022
No, you haven't understood
what l said

439
00:48:44,257 --> 00:48:50,518
What l was trying to say is that
you're young... and beautiful

440
00:48:51,256 --> 00:48:56,052
You have a nice figure.
So why...

441
00:48:56,289 --> 00:49:00,880
ln any case, you have very noble ideals

442
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:05,211
Brother...

443
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:11,721
l see.
- Oh yes

444
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:18,388
A telephone has been connected at your place

445
00:49:19,788 --> 00:49:20,879
So...

446
00:49:26,289 --> 00:49:28,255
May l go?

447
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:31,422
lt has been connected.
- That's right

448
00:49:34,156 --> 00:49:38,248
As l said, you will not have any problem here

449
00:49:38,823 --> 00:49:41,085
You must work with all your "heart"

450
00:50:00,689 --> 00:50:02,621
The telephone's been connected, right?

451
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:09,622
Nothing. Get on with your work.

452
00:50:15,189 --> 00:50:17,122
l've been thinking about you

453
00:50:35,223 --> 00:50:40,155
Laxmi, get me a soda.
A soda water

454
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:47,154
So brothers and sister, here's a couplet

455
00:50:48,223 --> 00:50:49,484
lt goes like this.
- Go on

456
00:50:49,724 --> 00:50:51,485
"l arrived at the mai khana (liquor den)"

457
00:50:51,724 --> 00:50:53,656
Where?
- At the mai khana

458
00:50:54,223 --> 00:50:57,656
"At the mai-khana, l had no money"

459
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:01,481
"He asked me for the bill. l
gave away my dil (heart)"

460
00:51:04,223 --> 00:51:06,156
What's that?
- Soda

461
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:08,185
Where to?
- The boss has a stomach-ache

462
00:51:08,423 --> 00:51:12,685
A stomach-ache? Give that to
me. l'll take the soda to him

463
00:51:13,757 --> 00:51:16,190
Nice medicine for a heart-ache

464
00:51:16,424 --> 00:51:19,686
The boss has a stomach-ache, eh?
Let me...

465
00:51:24,424 --> 00:51:26,014
Salutations

466
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:29,190
The name is Abdul Karim Durrani

467
00:51:29,925 --> 00:51:34,515
l'm the boss's best friend
Soda... for the stomach-ache

468
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:37,355
Salutations

469
00:51:39,924 --> 00:51:43,219
Listen... she's gone

470
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:47,221
The ache has started all over again, brother?

471
00:51:48,124 --> 00:51:51,385
lt goes to the heart from the stomach

472
00:51:51,624 --> 00:51:53,215
What's your problem?

473
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,556
Something's wrong with the tummy suddenly

474
00:51:55,957 --> 00:51:57,548
Suddenly?

475
00:51:58,124 --> 00:52:04,386
Loosen your belt.
The pain Will vanish

476
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:11,723
Happens sometimes after the youth.
- What?

477
00:52:11,957 --> 00:52:14,583
That which reaches the
heart from the stomach

478
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:35,923
The alarm has gone off.
The tea must be ready

479
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:39,587
Right?

480
00:52:39,825 --> 00:52:42,256
l'm in the habit of having tea at 5 every day

481
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:45,924
But time flew today and l didn't
even realise when it was 5

482
00:52:58,858 --> 00:53:00,790
Help yourself to some

483
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:15,619
l love this song!

484
00:53:16,191 --> 00:53:19,784
why're you late today? l've
been waiting with the tea

485
00:53:20,224 --> 00:53:23,657
This client lady came over...
- Lady?

486
00:53:23,892 --> 00:53:26,483
lt was a man actually.
Make me some tea quickly

487
00:53:26,725 --> 00:53:28,657
l haven't had any tea today

488
00:53:32,725 --> 00:53:37,988
Darling, why do you think
l have spent 5333 rupees?

489
00:53:38,392 --> 00:53:41,483
which 5333 Rupees?
- On that telephone

490
00:53:42,558 --> 00:53:45,991
You didn't call all day. lt felt so lonely

491
00:53:46,392 --> 00:53:49,324
Call, l did. And you were busy.

492
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:55,351
Oh yes. That client lady...
- What?

493
00:53:55,592 --> 00:53:57,525
l mean, the client was there

494
00:53:58,093 --> 00:54:00,025
You have a way with words

495
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:04,191
This is the limit. l miss you at office all day...

496
00:54:04,592 --> 00:54:06,524
and you just don't care for my sentiments

497
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:13,017
Sometimes l think you're play acting.
You ought to have been an actor

498
00:54:13,258 --> 00:54:18,521
Darling, actors only play act
when it comes to love

499
00:54:18,758 --> 00:54:22,690
They know nothing about love.
Or why'd there be so many scandals?

500
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:25,683
And a man's love with his
wife is a scandal in our case

501
00:54:26,425 --> 00:54:29,391
People at the office are amazed
that even after eight years...

502
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:33,548
you and l still love each other.
And so much, at that!

503
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,720
Aren't you keeping well?

504
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,592
l'm all right, but...

505
00:55:10,826 --> 00:55:12,759
what is the matter, sir?

506
00:55:14,492 --> 00:55:19,255
Nirmala, every man in this
world has his share of sorrows

507
00:55:20,326 --> 00:55:22,758
lt's some sorrow or the other

508
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:27,417
what is your worry, sir?

509
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,955
Actually, my wife...

510
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:46,622
has been ill for the last six years.
She can neither stand, nor sit down

511
00:55:49,026 --> 00:55:52,958
l've tried a thousand cures.
After all those treatments...

512
00:55:53,959 --> 00:55:57,119
l've become a doctor myself.
- What is she ailing from?

513
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:00,959
You had rather not ask

514
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,788
You must ask what disease
she's not suffering from

515
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:18,822
l don't know what to do.
My brains have failed me

516
00:56:20,727 --> 00:56:23,489
Doctors in allopathy,
ayurved, unani medicine...

517
00:56:24,226 --> 00:56:28,318
astrologers, exorcists... l've consulted them all

518
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:31,492
Each one of them has given up

519
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:37,489
But what the astrologer
says makes me shudder

520
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,660
what did the astrologer say?

521
00:56:41,594 --> 00:56:43,526
Certain death

522
00:56:44,593 --> 00:56:48,185
Sharda has just about
13 or 11 months to live

523
00:57:01,927 --> 00:57:05,188
well, buddy?
- l... how are you?

524
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:08,854
Have you drunk it?
- Drunk what?

525
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,851
Tea. Will you have some tea?

526
00:57:17,793 --> 00:57:19,884
why're you coughing?
You're okay, l hope?

527
00:57:20,628 --> 00:57:22,559
lt's okay. l had some betel-nut
which got stuck in my throat

528
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,721
Listen, return right on time today. Okay?

529
00:57:31,294 --> 00:57:33,226
Yes, l'll return on time

530
00:57:33,628 --> 00:57:36,889
And listen... make sure to
take your medicine on time

531
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,392
Okay?

532
00:57:47,994 --> 00:57:50,586
Sir, please don't be sad

533
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,251
Let me know if there is anything l can do

534
00:57:56,661 --> 00:58:02,924
Just give me a smile... that'll last me a lifetime

535
00:58:04,995 --> 00:58:06,927
May l return to my seat, sir?

536
00:58:10,995 --> 00:58:13,928
May l return to my seat?
- Go on

537
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:39,952
what's this? You've started a hospital here?

538
00:58:40,195 --> 00:58:43,627
l was feeling a bit under the weather

539
00:58:45,694 --> 00:58:49,786
There's a name for it in English.
lt's called "Love in the afternoon"

540
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,627
And there's a couplet in Urdu

541
00:58:53,027 --> 00:58:54,653
lt says...
- No!

542
00:58:54,895 --> 00:58:56,327
Salutations

543
00:59:04,562 --> 00:59:08,493
"The dark clouds sprinkled
water on the saplings"

544
00:59:09,228 --> 00:59:13,320
"lt rained water, but l was left thirsty"

545
00:59:13,896 --> 00:59:15,828
That's the couplet

546
00:59:16,229 --> 00:59:18,319
Peon! Get me a glass of cold water

547
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:23,823
The spanner...
- Here it is

548
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:28,191
what are you doing?
- The car's stalled again

549
00:59:28,595 --> 00:59:31,026
You could've called a mechanic.
D'you think you can repair it?

550
00:59:31,428 --> 00:59:34,190
Oh yes. Don't worry. lt'll be fit

551
00:59:35,096 --> 00:59:37,686
l've done my mechanical engineering.
That's no mean thing

552
00:59:38,762 --> 00:59:42,694
Rinku, give me the plier.
- Here it is

553
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:45,027
Have some sherbet. Come on out

554
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:50,693
Give it to me

555
00:59:52,762 --> 00:59:55,023
why don't you sell the
car? lt's always falling sick

556
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:04,217
l've told you. This is my first car.
And it's been lucky too

557
01:00:06,195 --> 01:00:08,388
Like you.
- You're so dirty!

558
01:00:09,128 --> 01:00:11,594
Take this.
- Drink it up

559
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:28,427
Mr Mechanical Engineer, it's evening
already and it's time for supper

560
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:31,523
Have you met with any success?
- l've opened her up

561
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:36,088
But l can't figure out
which part fits where

562
01:00:36,496 --> 01:00:39,087
You were good at fitting things.
- l used to be

563
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,893
But l've forgotten it all
ever since l got into sales

564
01:00:43,563 --> 01:00:46,960
Call the mechanic and ask him
to take away the car right now

565
01:00:47,328 --> 01:00:49,261
l want it ready by tomorrow
morning, at any cost

566
01:00:49,596 --> 01:00:51,528
what's the hurry?
Take a cab

567
01:00:52,162 --> 01:00:53,924
There's this client l've got to impress

568
01:00:57,595 --> 01:01:01,084
This car was gathering rust like me.
- And now?

569
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:03,595
Now see how fast it's moving

570
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:07,519
Nirmala, l too want to race faster in life

571
01:01:08,595 --> 01:01:11,925
You have given me so much.
with you...

572
01:01:12,196 --> 01:01:15,923
l have realised for the first time
that life has so much to offer

573
01:01:16,263 --> 01:01:17,524
Really?

574
01:01:30,196 --> 01:01:32,128
lt was a lovely evening

575
01:01:33,196 --> 01:01:34,923
Yes. l'll remember it all my life

576
01:01:35,196 --> 01:01:36,924
won't you come in?

577
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:38,924
won't you have some tea?
- No

578
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:42,425
lt's time to give my wife
her medicines, you see

579
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:46,929
This is fun!

580
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:51,428
After dinner, let's go out on a
drive every night. Just like this

581
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:54,889
lt's really very boring at home.
This is fun, isn't it?

582
01:01:55,529 --> 01:01:58,155
what a life, sweetheart!

583
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:01,390
who can be more fortunate than l am?

584
01:02:02,131 --> 01:02:07,427
A first-class job, a first-class wife,
a first-class son and a first-class...

585
01:02:08,029 --> 01:02:09,962
Look ahead! Don't go wayward

586
01:02:10,664 --> 01:02:12,595
So let's go

587
01:02:21,264 --> 01:02:23,855
what's this?
- What happened?

588
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,062
lt has stalled again!

589
01:02:40,863 --> 01:02:44,058
Let's go. lt's not very far anyway

590
01:02:44,631 --> 01:02:46,563
will we have to push it?
- A bit

591
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,095
Take the wheel, son. Come on

592
01:02:49,697 --> 01:02:51,491
Get started

593
01:03:04,898 --> 01:03:06,591
Straighten it

594
01:03:09,298 --> 01:03:11,229
Step on the brakes

595
01:03:13,365 --> 01:03:16,956
Sell this junk now. l can't
waste anymore money on it

596
01:03:17,365 --> 01:03:20,024
There's romance in this too.
A unique style

597
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:22,697
lt was fun pushing it along

598
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:25,259
wasn't it son?
- l really enjoyed myself!

599
01:03:36,398 --> 01:03:38,260
Medicines again? what's up?

600
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:42,995
what will l tell you?

601
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:46,255
l've been up all night.
- What happened?

602
01:03:48,696 --> 01:03:52,424
My wife's condition deteriorated suddenly

603
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:57,285
l can see only darkness all around

604
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:03,287
l don't know what to do. Must l
kill myself under a running train?

605
01:04:03,697 --> 01:04:07,289
Or must l drown?
- Ranjit, look at me

606
01:04:08,364 --> 01:04:11,819
You will not cry... l'm with you, am l not?

607
01:04:14,831 --> 01:04:21,287
You're right, Nirmala.
You're my only support

608
01:04:22,164 --> 01:04:24,097
So get a grip on yourself

609
01:04:24,366 --> 01:04:26,297
what will people in the office say?

610
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:29,821
Go and wash your face. l'll handle it

611
01:04:32,198 --> 01:04:34,131
For my sake, you mustn't cry

612
01:04:35,265 --> 01:04:37,788
lf you cry, it'll be an insult to my love

613
01:04:39,399 --> 01:04:42,331
Love...?
- Yes, my love

614
01:04:43,399 --> 01:04:44,659
Smile now

615
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:56,323
what's up? You're in a great mood today?

616
01:04:56,665 --> 01:04:58,598
lt's all thanks to your love
and the lovely weather

617
01:04:58,898 --> 01:05:01,023
Go and change quickly.
- All right

618
01:05:15,832 --> 01:05:18,024
lt's 2 hours and your daddy
hasn't yet come downstairs

619
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,627
He must he up there.
- What could he be doing?

620
01:05:33,665 --> 01:05:36,063
Looks like dad's gone to sleep in the bathroom

621
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:38,664
l'll go and take a look

622
01:05:55,132 --> 01:05:56,893
Have you gone to sleep?

623
01:05:57,466 --> 01:05:59,398
l'm coming

624
01:06:36,899 --> 01:06:38,831
Are you okay?

625
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:42,465
l had some lentil-curry at
the office this afternoon

626
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:45,195
There's been a problem ever since.
Maybe l'm constipated

627
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,929
You should've told me.
l'd have given you a herb

628
01:06:48,232 --> 01:06:50,460
Your tummy would have been cleared.
- All right

629
01:06:55,132 --> 01:06:57,065
Shall we start?

630
01:07:02,532 --> 01:07:04,465
Chick-pea!

631
01:07:14,566 --> 01:07:17,896
Bread for you.
Bread for me

632
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,632
You will get only a soup

633
01:07:28,567 --> 01:07:31,498
Maybe some yogurt too.
But no bread for you

634
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:35,765
Drink your soup now

635
01:07:45,566 --> 01:07:47,533
This chick-pea's great, daddy!

636
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,031
How's the chicken?
- First Class!

637
01:07:57,166 --> 01:08:03,531
Really? So give me a little.
- Not him. He has an upset stomach

638
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:07,066
what's happened to daddy's tummy?
- He has constipation

639
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,929
what's constipation, daddy?
- You'd rather not ask me, my son

640
01:08:11,933 --> 01:08:13,865
One gets only soup to drink

641
01:08:25,834 --> 01:08:28,299
Chicken, ham...

642
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,296
Gulp this down.
- What's this?

643
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:43,829
A herbal mix.
- No. My stomach's clean

644
01:08:44,434 --> 01:08:47,161
Don't be stubborn. Now
open your mouth. Or else...

645
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:00,998
Now go to sleep

646
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:03,394
How about love?

647
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:07,326
Excessive love-making gives
you a bad stomach. Go to sleep

648
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:12,394
No love. No food

649
01:09:26,668 --> 01:09:28,634
Tea's here! Come on out soon

650
01:09:57,035 --> 01:09:58,625
Stomach's clean?

651
01:10:05,736 --> 01:10:08,667
Your remedy did more than necessary

652
01:10:10,736 --> 01:10:12,667
will you have some tea?

653
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:17,194
Give it to me

654
01:10:25,135 --> 01:10:26,861
Eat slowly

655
01:10:40,767 --> 01:10:42,233
what happened?

656
01:10:42,768 --> 01:10:46,700
Take my advise and take the day off.
- l'm going upstairs

657
01:10:49,102 --> 01:10:53,500
lt's amazing what crossroads life brings us to

658
01:10:53,768 --> 01:10:55,700
what happened?
- Look at me.

659
01:10:56,668 --> 01:10:58,498
Ever since you've joined the office

660
01:10:58,768 --> 01:11:01,166
One moment. l'll show you my personal diary

661
01:11:01,435 --> 01:11:03,697
Do you always carry that diary?
- Yes

662
01:11:04,768 --> 01:11:07,929
This has been my confidante, so
far. lt could understand my sorrow

663
01:11:09,802 --> 01:11:13,734
And now?
- lt shares my happiness too

664
01:11:17,802 --> 01:11:21,393
"Before Nirmala came into my life,
l thought of committing suicide"

665
01:11:22,402 --> 01:11:24,493
"But now there's such a change"

666
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:29,396
"My house was a hospital and l found
the atmosphere in the office stifling"

667
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:34,064
"But ever since Nirmal has come, the
office has become a heaven for me"

668
01:11:34,802 --> 01:11:38,734
"The effect of her company is
like balm for an injured man"

669
01:11:41,303 --> 01:11:44,234
"Nirmala is a joyous gust of wind..."

670
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,759
Stop it, Ranjit. l don't like flattery

671
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:50,031
But l'm amazed to see how tolerant you are

672
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:53,300
You are my strength, Nirmala

673
01:11:53,835 --> 01:11:57,767
Or l was drifting away across the shore

674
01:12:04,836 --> 01:12:06,768
what a strange feeling

675
01:12:07,168 --> 01:12:11,760
To be with someone, to feel
his fingers run through you...

676
01:12:12,169 --> 01:12:14,134
and the excitement...

677
01:12:17,202 --> 01:12:20,328
is this love?
- Yes

678
01:12:21,869 --> 01:12:24,802
These are the sweet feelings they call "love"

679
01:12:25,869 --> 01:12:28,802
Can't we meet everyday?
- Why not?

680
01:12:30,069 --> 01:12:32,535
But l must go home after office hours

681
01:12:33,004 --> 01:12:34,934
l have to give my wife her medicines, you see

682
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:37,535
l'll come away, after l have
given her the medicines

683
01:12:39,036 --> 01:12:42,196
l'll get to spend some
moments of a normal life too

684
01:12:44,869 --> 01:12:47,301
l think we ought to leave.
- Yes

685
01:12:54,802 --> 01:12:57,826
Do you have a telephone around?
- Yes. We have a telephone at home

686
01:12:58,569 --> 01:13:00,502
we've been given a connection
because of my grandpa's illness

687
01:13:00,803 --> 01:13:06,099
So give me your number quickly. l feel
like talking to you so often at home

688
01:13:34,603 --> 01:13:36,659
Let's have some fun today.
Let's watch a movie,...

689
01:13:36,936 --> 01:13:39,869
eat at a nice restaurant and
generally blow up money

690
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:42,600
Half the food is already cooked.
- We'll eat that in the morning

691
01:13:43,203 --> 01:13:45,863
will we get tickets to the movie?
- Sweetheart...

692
01:13:46,937 --> 01:13:48,869
l've already brought the tickets

693
01:13:49,271 --> 01:13:50,430
Nice way you have of showing your love!

694
01:13:51,937 --> 01:13:53,528
Get ready quickly

695
01:14:00,337 --> 01:14:02,326
"ln your name..."

696
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,899
"my heart..."

697
01:14:10,804 --> 01:14:14,895
"l feel like giving my heart away to you"

698
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:27,765
"Before l die..."

699
01:14:28,004 --> 01:14:30,936
"l must do this
which is most necessary"

700
01:14:31,504 --> 01:14:33,662
"ln your name..."

701
01:14:34,004 --> 01:14:35,936
"My heart..."

702
01:14:41,904 --> 01:14:46,200
"l feel like bequeathing my heart in your name"

703
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:53,764
"Before l die..."

704
01:14:54,005 --> 01:14:56,664
"it's necessary that l do this"

705
01:15:20,272 --> 01:15:26,966
"With you, begins my story"

706
01:15:27,438 --> 01:15:29,961
"The whole world knows that"

707
01:15:31,038 --> 01:15:37,436
"lt'll end with you some
day, the story of my life"

708
01:15:37,971 --> 01:15:40,732
"l'm crazy about you"

709
01:15:46,137 --> 01:15:48,797
"For your happiness..."

710
01:15:49,105 --> 01:15:53,401
"l'd die right now, and end my story"

711
01:15:59,737 --> 01:16:01,795
"ln your name..."

712
01:16:02,205 --> 01:16:04,727
"My heart's in your name"

713
01:16:10,205 --> 01:16:14,365
"l feel like bequeathing my heart in your name"

714
01:16:20,537 --> 01:16:22,026
"Before l die..."

715
01:16:22,338 --> 01:16:25,031
"l must do what is most necessary"

716
01:16:53,972 --> 01:17:00,894
"l don't know why people find love difficult..."

717
01:17:01,205 --> 01:17:04,070
"and complain"

718
01:17:04,873 --> 01:17:11,395
"Why are they scared of being
jilted and getting a bad name?"

719
01:17:20,171 --> 01:17:22,296
"For your love..."

720
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:27,436
"l could take a bad name for myself any day"

721
01:17:27,972 --> 01:17:32,904
"With a smile l'd accept a bad name"

722
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:40,094
"Before l die..."

723
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:43,270
"l'd do it"

724
01:17:43,839 --> 01:17:48,737
"l feel like bequeathing my heart in your name"

725
01:17:49,339 --> 01:17:54,135
"ln your name... my heart's in your name"

726
01:18:11,574 --> 01:18:14,131
Damn it! lt's broken down again!
- What happens now?

727
01:18:15,073 --> 01:18:16,232
l'll call the mechanic and he'll
tow it away to his garage

728
01:18:18,206 --> 01:18:19,934
Come, let's take a cab

729
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,966
l'm late today

730
01:18:28,373 --> 01:18:30,771
Daddy, you're late every evening nowadays

731
01:18:31,572 --> 01:18:33,903
l can't help it, son. l get held up

732
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,170
l'm a servant after all

733
01:18:37,972 --> 01:18:40,495
l had to go and see this party
The car broke down...

734
01:18:40,673 --> 01:18:42,729
on Tulsi Pipe Road and l had to walk it down

735
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:46,028
Couldn't you take a bus or a cab?
- Strike! Don't you know?

736
01:18:46,339 --> 01:18:48,271
They're on strike today.
So l had to come walking

737
01:18:48,506 --> 01:18:52,166
l've told you so often to change
your car. But you won't listen

738
01:18:52,573 --> 01:18:54,870
And you'll ask me to
change my wife tomorrow

739
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:58,629
Madam, l don't change anything

740
01:18:59,606 --> 01:19:03,004
lf you don't want an old one, get a new one

741
01:19:04,274 --> 01:19:06,205
Not a bad idea

742
01:19:06,806 --> 01:19:09,931
l must get a new one

743
01:19:11,407 --> 01:19:14,202
May l go and bathe?
- Go ahead

744
01:19:35,208 --> 01:19:36,969
Listen to a couplet

745
01:19:37,307 --> 01:19:40,239
"You hurled it from a
distance, and l pounced on it"

746
01:19:40,707 --> 01:19:44,036
"lf not you in my heart, it's
the arrow you have shot"

747
01:19:44,407 --> 01:19:47,236
Brother, please let me work.
- Brother?

748
01:19:47,673 --> 01:19:50,037
You don't even know to appreciate a couplet!

749
01:19:51,674 --> 01:19:54,606
Here's another couplet.
And listen carefully

750
01:19:55,774 --> 01:20:00,263
"lt got into me from my back
and took away my heart away"

751
01:20:00,573 --> 01:20:02,732
"Just as your arrow"
- Brother, please!

752
01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:05,263
Brother? Can't you call me just by my name?

753
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,069
l have another couplet.
- No!

754
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,272
Listen to it...
- No!

755
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:15,671
She has left. And she will definitely report me

756
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:19,135
But poets are not afraid.
what difference does it make?

757
01:20:19,474 --> 01:20:20,871
Mr Durrani, the boss has sent for you

758
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,598
See? l wasn't wrong! l'm coming

759
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:26,602
Love gets you into trouble, Durrani!

760
01:20:33,575 --> 01:20:34,801
Sorry

761
01:20:35,374 --> 01:20:37,307
Did you send for me, brother?
- Yes

762
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,905
what nonsense is this, Durrani?
You won't work, and...

763
01:20:43,108 --> 01:20:45,801
won't let anybody else work either
- Nothing of the sort, brother

764
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:49,465
l was reciting a couplet to her on your behalf

765
01:20:49,774 --> 01:20:51,172
You may listen to it too

766
01:20:51,441 --> 01:20:54,895
"You hurled it from a
distance, and l pounced on it"

767
01:20:55,775 --> 01:20:59,831
"lf not you in my heart, it's
the arrow you have shot"

768
01:21:01,275 --> 01:21:05,298
This and another couplet l recited.
She didn't listen to the third

769
01:21:05,775 --> 01:21:10,002
You listen to it. "Love has
left you worthless, Durrani"

770
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:12,738
"Or l was of some worth too"

771
01:21:13,841 --> 01:21:17,330
what do you think?
- lt isn't yours. lt's Ghalib's

772
01:21:17,841 --> 01:21:19,773
l didn't say it's mine

773
01:21:23,307 --> 01:21:25,137
This is how the world is, brother

774
01:21:25,507 --> 01:21:28,667
The first class guys can fall in love

775
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:33,934
And third-class guys end up being poets!

776
01:21:34,508 --> 01:21:36,666
Please return to your work.
- Thank you, sir

777
01:21:45,441 --> 01:21:47,373
Call Nirmala here.
- Very well, sir

778
01:21:55,442 --> 01:21:57,374
Now listen, today...

779
01:21:57,842 --> 01:21:59,774
Let that be

780
01:22:00,241 --> 01:22:04,833
l've got to be home at 5 today. l've
got to give my wife her medicines

781
01:22:05,841 --> 01:22:09,036
At what time do we meet then?
- At 7?

782
01:22:09,442 --> 01:22:12,896
7 is okay. But where? l don't
even have the car today

783
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:16,738
we'll meet nearby.
will Juhu be okay?

784
01:22:17,175 --> 01:22:20,902
Okay... no! That's where
Sharda's father lives

785
01:22:22,342 --> 01:22:26,740
Let's meet somewhere at
Bandra or Khar. Gazebo

786
01:22:28,841 --> 01:22:30,932
Gazebo then. At 7

787
01:22:41,475 --> 01:22:44,407
l've brought the files and
quotations you asked for, sir

788
01:22:53,508 --> 01:22:55,839
How long have you been
working in this office?

789
01:22:56,242 --> 01:22:58,037
lt's been four years, sir

790
01:22:58,309 --> 01:23:00,433
ln four years, haven't you even learnt...

791
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:04,902
that before you enter someone's
cabin, you must knock?

792
01:23:07,408 --> 01:23:09,341
Don't make such a mistake again

793
01:23:16,842 --> 01:23:19,105
Here you are. ls it okay?
- Okay

794
01:23:23,542 --> 01:23:25,474
Madam, is this where
Mr Ranjit lives?

795
01:23:26,542 --> 01:23:28,371
l've come to collect money for towing his car

796
01:23:28,643 --> 01:23:30,269
How much is it?
- 53 rupees

797
01:23:30,543 --> 01:23:32,633
why so much?
- lt was all the way from Tulsi Lake

798
01:23:33,043 --> 01:23:35,634
lt's so far away. 24 kilometers

799
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:39,142
Hold this, please.

800
01:23:47,542 --> 01:23:49,270
Here you are

801
01:23:50,675 --> 01:23:52,266
Thank you, madam

802
01:23:53,676 --> 01:23:58,507
Tulsi Pipe Road? Tulsi Lake?
l can't figure out anything

803
01:23:59,276 --> 01:24:01,003
Hi darling!

804
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:04,841
You asked me to return at 5 and here l am

805
01:24:05,576 --> 01:24:08,837
Did l say anything?
- What's up? You look upset

806
01:24:09,175 --> 01:24:11,641
Nothing. Go and get ready. l'll make some tea

807
01:24:12,377 --> 01:24:13,842
Very well

808
01:24:31,377 --> 01:24:35,867
with your permission, madam,
may l get on with my over-time?

809
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:40,372
where's the need to do over-time?
- lt's for the family!

810
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:42,939
Or why would l bother?
May l go?

811
01:24:43,776 --> 01:24:46,936
when have l stopped you?
- Smile, when you say it

812
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:50,642
Go on.
- That's something!

813
01:26:02,077 --> 01:26:04,008
why?

814
01:26:10,144 --> 01:26:13,235
Tell me, how did these lipstick
stains get on your handkerchief?

815
01:26:14,111 --> 01:26:16,044
who is this girl?

816
01:26:17,044 --> 01:26:19,636
My handkerchief? And lipstick?

817
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:24,043
lsn't it yours?
- No

818
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:26,972
So whose is it?
- That's what l'd like to know

819
01:26:29,711 --> 01:26:35,234
Oh yes. l remember! There were these
sales girls at the office yesterday

820
01:26:35,711 --> 01:26:38,801
One of them had a cold and asked
for a handkerchief. l gave it to her

821
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:42,068
This must be... it is her lipstick

822
01:26:46,277 --> 01:26:49,540
Now tell me how the car got to Tulsi Lake?

823
01:26:50,011 --> 01:26:51,943
who told you?
- The mechanic

824
01:26:52,744 --> 01:26:54,677
He said Tulsi Lake?
- Yes

825
01:26:55,144 --> 01:26:57,406
Strange guys, these mechanics!

826
01:26:57,912 --> 01:27:01,934
He said Tulsi Lake instead of
Tulsi Pipe Road. Bloody illiterate!

827
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:07,066
Tulsi Pipe Road's nearby. So why
did it cost 53 rupees to tow the car?

828
01:27:07,478 --> 01:27:09,410
He took 53 rupees from you?!
- Yes!

829
01:27:12,112 --> 01:27:17,067
l see. So you're angry because the
mechanic robbed 53 rupees from you

830
01:27:18,012 --> 01:27:21,501
l see. But that's what the issue is

831
01:27:22,444 --> 01:27:25,706
For all the hard work l put in for
the family, no one will praise me

832
01:27:26,444 --> 01:27:28,876
And you suspect me over trivia like this?

833
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:34,977
All right. No more over time.
l'll call my boss immediately

834
01:27:37,013 --> 01:27:39,706
All l want is my family and your happiness

835
01:27:41,113 --> 01:27:43,043
what else would l ever want?

836
01:27:59,845 --> 01:28:03,299
Mr Sinha...
- Mr Sinha? wrong number

837
01:28:09,811 --> 01:28:11,276
l see

838
01:28:27,178 --> 01:28:31,235
This is Ranjit. l'm not coming to work today

839
01:28:32,145 --> 01:28:34,770
l can't do any over-time.
My wife isn't feeling well

840
01:28:35,245 --> 01:28:38,769
See you at the office tomorrow.
Yes, at the office

841
01:28:43,178 --> 01:28:45,110
Are you happy now?

842
01:28:59,579 --> 01:29:01,512
l told you on the
wedding night itself

843
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:05,208
lt's not a good thing to read
someone's personal diary

844
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:07,340
l told you, didn't l?

845
01:29:19,879 --> 01:29:24,402
Nirmala's diary now goes in

846
01:29:26,078 --> 01:29:28,237
And Sharda's diary, l will work on

847
01:29:37,913 --> 01:29:40,175
To begin with, let me
write Mr Sinha's number

848
01:30:22,447 --> 01:30:26,378
"Sharda, you are the Spring in my life"

849
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,872
"Like Spring, you have taken over"

850
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:57,574
"Had you not come into my life..."

851
01:30:57,979 --> 01:31:00,912
"What would happen to me?"

852
01:31:01,147 --> 01:31:02,510
Here l am!

853
01:31:03,979 --> 01:31:05,639
what happened?

854
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:08,946
You mustn't read a personal
diary. l told you that earlier

855
01:31:09,246 --> 01:31:11,735
when did you tell me?
- Didn't l?

856
01:31:12,013 --> 01:31:13,809
No.
- l'm telling you now anyway

857
01:31:14,147 --> 01:31:18,079
All right. But l know what's
written in that diary

858
01:31:18,414 --> 01:31:19,812
what?

859
01:31:31,446 --> 01:31:34,743
You get to understand everything.
So what's the point in writing it?

860
01:31:35,381 --> 01:31:38,313
You must write, and l will keep understanding

861
01:31:41,047 --> 01:31:43,378
Let's get to work. Dictation.
- No dictation

862
01:31:44,048 --> 01:31:46,570
Tell me what happened yesterday.
- What happened?

863
01:31:46,914 --> 01:31:48,972
Over the phone?
- l see. The telephone

864
01:31:49,447 --> 01:31:55,106
As usual, my wife took ill and
some relatives dropped in

865
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:58,370
But what was that about Mr Sinha?
why did you sound so scared?

866
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:03,979
Now darling, what more could l
have said in my relatives' presence?

867
01:32:04,314 --> 01:32:05,870
what could l have said?

868
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:09,976
But you're no less than any Mr Sinha for me

869
01:32:30,648 --> 01:32:32,875
Madam, you're the one
who's late today

870
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:34,872
You're early, sir

871
01:32:35,181 --> 01:32:38,305
That's what l'll do everyday.
That's because l love you so much!

872
01:32:39,382 --> 01:32:42,007
l'll go and have a quick bath.
Make some tea for me. Hurry

873
01:33:22,482 --> 01:33:24,414
l left the wrong diary downstairs!

874
01:33:37,548 --> 01:33:39,479
what happened?
- Nothing

875
01:33:39,814 --> 01:33:42,474
l came downstairs to pick up
a magazine, but l'm in a hurry

876
01:33:59,849 --> 01:34:02,111
l told you. You mustn't read a personal diary

877
01:34:02,516 --> 01:34:04,106
Give it to me.
- l will read it!

878
01:34:04,349 --> 01:34:06,780
You will not read it.
- l will read it today!

879
01:34:07,082 --> 01:34:11,105
But this is my personal diary! lt
has some very private feelings

880
01:34:11,383 --> 01:34:14,110
Give it to me!
- l'm your wife! l can read everything!

881
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:18,581
Okay, read it!

882
01:34:39,415 --> 01:34:41,938
"Sharda, l can't live without you"

883
01:34:43,116 --> 01:34:46,842
"Had Sharda not come into my life,
there'd have been such a void"

884
01:34:47,714 --> 01:34:50,874
"l can't figure out
whether Sharda is my life,..."

885
01:34:51,115 --> 01:34:53,308
"or my life is all about Sharda"
- Have you read the diary?

886
01:34:57,116 --> 01:35:00,173
You must think what an ass l am, right?

887
01:35:02,249 --> 01:35:04,182
No, Ranjit!

888
01:35:05,716 --> 01:35:07,647
Now tell me something, Sharda

889
01:35:08,049 --> 01:35:10,514
why were you so bent on reading my diary?

890
01:35:14,682 --> 01:35:16,615
Me, you suspect?!
- No!

891
01:35:20,249 --> 01:35:22,182
l had told you not to read it

892
01:35:29,249 --> 01:35:33,840
well, well... you look happy today.
- l have a special reason

893
01:35:35,616 --> 01:35:39,548
Really? l ought to be told too.
- You'll soon know

894
01:35:44,517 --> 01:35:46,709
You signed it without even reading anything?

895
01:35:47,449 --> 01:35:49,711
So?
- You trust me so much that...

896
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:52,211
you will sign anything l type?

897
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:58,079
Darling, you had to type
even my death warrant...

898
01:35:58,349 --> 01:36:03,213
l'd sign it without going through it.
Now tell me, what's up?

899
01:36:03,650 --> 01:36:05,446
l've found a better job

900
01:36:06,683 --> 01:36:09,240
l see. Where?

901
01:36:09,650 --> 01:36:13,514
At Parks & Favor.
- l have a close friend there. Khanna

902
01:36:13,983 --> 01:36:16,244
He's the G.M.
- He personally gave me the offer

903
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:18,377
Khanna did?
- Yes

904
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:25,575
l see. And why not? He has
more money than l have

905
01:36:26,816 --> 01:36:31,646
He's young too. What will you
get from a sad, old man like me?

906
01:36:32,583 --> 01:36:35,242
But he's not as young as he appears to be

907
01:36:35,616 --> 01:36:38,640
He wears a wig!
- Who told you l'm going away?

908
01:36:39,117 --> 01:36:40,946
You just told me that
you're getting a better job

909
01:36:41,183 --> 01:36:44,014
l am. But l'm not going away.
- So what is this?

910
01:36:46,584 --> 01:36:50,276
My resignation was just a joke.
You signed that too?

911
01:36:51,683 --> 01:36:56,275
l'll never leave you. l won't go anywhere

912
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:59,282
Not even to Parks and Favor?
- No

913
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:02,681
lt's okay then.
- May l go?

914
01:37:06,618 --> 01:37:10,549
Khanna, you ass! Sonofagun!

915
01:37:11,751 --> 01:37:13,683
You're trying to snatch my girl!

916
01:37:14,817 --> 01:37:16,078
Damn you!

917
01:37:17,516 --> 01:37:19,312
Can't you see where you're going?

918
01:37:19,716 --> 01:37:21,649
l'm looking, indeed

919
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:24,510
"The world has..."

920
01:37:24,817 --> 01:37:26,078
She has gone

921
01:37:28,383 --> 01:37:30,111
Bloody Khanna!

922
01:37:49,417 --> 01:37:53,008
You're bribing me.
- Darling...

923
01:37:53,817 --> 01:38:00,613
l give only love.
And l take nothing but love

924
01:38:13,551 --> 01:38:15,141
lt's me

925
01:38:18,418 --> 01:38:20,179
You're smelling great

926
01:38:20,451 --> 01:38:22,610
And you said the other day,
that l was jumping about

927
01:38:22,952 --> 01:38:24,884
Don't you lose your way

928
01:38:28,784 --> 01:38:30,716
Looks like you've just met a girl

929
01:38:31,618 --> 01:38:33,776
How could l be so fortunate?

930
01:38:34,851 --> 01:38:39,249
l have just one woman in my life.
And she is my good fortune

931
01:38:40,450 --> 01:38:44,110
There was this guy selling perfumes
at the office today. Smuggled stuff

932
01:38:45,251 --> 01:38:47,376
He sprayed some perfume on me and l liked it

933
01:38:47,918 --> 01:38:53,214
And l brought this for you.
- For me?

934
01:38:53,584 --> 01:38:55,244
Of course. Everything belongs to you

935
01:38:55,485 --> 01:38:58,212
The perfume is yours.
So am l

936
01:39:16,484 --> 01:39:20,009
Sir, l've brought your car.
- l said l'd collect it myself

937
01:39:20,486 --> 01:39:22,815
My boss wants the money.
Here's the bill

938
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:26,411
So much?
- l don't know about all that

939
01:39:26,652 --> 01:39:28,619
Call him up and ask him

940
01:39:34,519 --> 01:39:36,450
l found this in your car

941
01:39:37,518 --> 01:39:39,451
Must be your wife's.
- Yes

942
01:39:39,853 --> 01:39:42,182
what is it?
- Nothing, he has brought the car

943
01:39:42,519 --> 01:39:44,042
Go on

944
01:39:52,252 --> 01:39:54,843
You forgot it in the car.
- And l thought l had lost it

945
01:39:55,752 --> 01:39:59,445
How can you ever lose
what is with me?

946
01:40:00,885 --> 01:40:03,477
what's wrong? You look sad today.
- Nothing

947
01:40:04,818 --> 01:40:08,080
won't you tell me?
- My grandpa's very ill

948
01:40:08,752 --> 01:40:10,615
The doctor says he needs an operation

949
01:40:10,951 --> 01:40:12,815
So what's there to be sad about?

950
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:15,050
l'm with you.
we'll have him operated

951
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:17,211
How much will it cost?

952
01:40:17,552 --> 01:40:19,483
The doctor says it's about
5333 Rupees

953
01:40:20,152 --> 01:40:22,618
So all right. Whatever l have, is yours

954
01:40:23,219 --> 01:40:25,151
Prepare for the operation any time you want to

955
01:40:38,586 --> 01:40:40,984
Dad's jumped the gun again.
- Jumped the gun?

956
01:40:41,253 --> 01:40:44,685
Yes. Remember the Sunday picnic?
- Daddy doesn't have the time, son

957
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:49,509
He must've gone to meet the G.M.
- lt's always someone or the other

958
01:40:58,753 --> 01:41:01,514
Mummy! Daddy's bathroom is so filthy!

959
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:03,384
Let it be

960
01:41:04,587 --> 01:41:07,348
There's a lot of straws in the flush

961
01:41:07,754 --> 01:41:10,015
lt's a sin to break a bird's nest

962
01:41:13,387 --> 01:41:15,113
There's no bird here

963
01:41:15,419 --> 01:41:17,215
There must be eggs then

964
01:41:17,786 --> 01:41:21,979
You'll fall! Get down!
- l won't fall. Pick me up!

965
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:29,951
Mummy, this is daddy's library

966
01:41:38,086 --> 01:41:40,017
Set me down now

967
01:41:41,753 --> 01:41:43,685
May l go and play?
- Go on

968
01:42:02,253 --> 01:42:04,583
"Nirmala, Picnic Apartments,
Versova"

969
01:42:49,321 --> 01:42:51,649
ls the boss there?
- He's not in

970
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:53,643
who are you?

971
01:42:53,953 --> 01:42:56,385
l'm the maidservant speaking

972
01:42:56,786 --> 01:42:59,378
l see. How's the lady keeping?

973
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:01,550
who are you?

974
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:04,150
when the boss returns, tell
him that Nirmala had called

975
01:43:15,553 --> 01:43:17,315
Know what the G.M. told me today?

976
01:43:17,553 --> 01:43:19,485
He's going to make me
his deputy in a few days

977
01:43:22,454 --> 01:43:25,477
And you will be
Mrs Deputy General Manager! Happy?

978
01:43:25,921 --> 01:43:27,854
won't l be happy at your progress?

979
01:43:28,254 --> 01:43:30,117
That's something!
- Shall l serve the food?

980
01:43:30,354 --> 01:43:34,081
No food. l've got to meet a party.
They're here only for today

981
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:37,180
lt's late. l ought to be running along

982
01:44:49,821 --> 01:44:52,753
You're always letting me down.
You've ruined my Sunday, haven't you?

983
01:44:56,621 --> 01:44:59,314
There was so much work at the
office today, it gave me a headache

984
01:45:00,289 --> 01:45:02,778
Go and get me a glass of
water. l want to take an aspirin

985
01:45:05,188 --> 01:45:08,120
You mustn't work so hard.
Take care of yourself

986
01:45:09,122 --> 01:45:13,178
You get so tired.
- l'll do everything for the family

987
01:45:14,855 --> 01:45:18,185
True, Ranjit. You're doing
so much for the family

988
01:45:19,022 --> 01:45:21,784
Darling, l do it, because l get your love

989
01:45:22,254 --> 01:45:25,778
with so much of love from you,
l could reach out for the Moon

990
01:45:27,588 --> 01:45:31,113
The Moon's okay.
Don't reach for the skies itself

991
01:45:32,854 --> 01:45:33,786
what?

992
01:45:35,321 --> 01:45:38,481
You mustn't work so hard. l don't like it

993
01:45:39,788 --> 01:45:43,221
You have a double-burden.
- Double-burden?

994
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:49,544
Oh yes. Your work and the overtime

995
01:46:03,756 --> 01:46:05,688
Not tonight.
- Why not?

996
01:46:06,088 --> 01:46:07,850
You're very tired tonight.

997
01:46:08,189 --> 01:46:10,654
As if l'm too tired to make love

998
01:46:10,989 --> 01:46:12,852
No, you must relax

999
01:46:13,722 --> 01:46:19,177
l'm always here for you.
- So why're you refusing me now?

1000
01:46:20,656 --> 01:46:22,589
Must l think only about myself?

1001
01:46:22,923 --> 01:46:24,855
Mustn't l worry about my husband's health?

1002
01:46:25,323 --> 01:46:26,845
ls that done?

1003
01:46:27,924 --> 01:46:30,583
Go to sleep. Please

1004
01:47:05,023 --> 01:47:07,614
You're Nirmala?
- And who could you be?

1005
01:47:16,255 --> 01:47:18,915
Do you know him?
- Ranjit?

1006
01:47:20,323 --> 01:47:23,187
Are you in love with him?
- Who are you?

1007
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:26,921
l'm a press photographer

1008
01:47:28,256 --> 01:47:30,189
l've seen you with this man several times

1009
01:47:30,989 --> 01:47:32,922
So l took a photograph

1010
01:47:34,456 --> 01:47:36,921
And what did you think?
That l'm a blackmailer?

1011
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:39,720
Even if you were a blackmailer,
what harm could you do to me?

1012
01:47:40,256 --> 01:47:42,188
l don't hide my love

1013
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:48,355
Yes, l love this man. l love him very much

1014
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:55,349
But he looks a bit aged.
Maybe he's married

1015
01:47:56,023 --> 01:47:58,955
l know that. But it doesn't make a difference...

1016
01:47:59,189 --> 01:48:01,553
whether Ranjit is married or not.
- What does that mean?

1017
01:48:03,424 --> 01:48:07,947
l mean, that man is going to
seed because of his ailing wife

1018
01:48:09,023 --> 01:48:11,956
l'm giving that man some love and a new life

1019
01:48:12,257 --> 01:48:14,187
So what's wrong with that?

1020
01:48:14,756 --> 01:48:19,348
why mustn't l give him
some pleasure and relief?

1021
01:48:20,023 --> 01:48:22,183
lt's not a sin to give someone your
love, so he can start a new life

1022
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:24,422
Must l let Ranjit die
with his ailing wife?

1023
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:28,679
what are you talking about?
- l don't wish his wife any ill

1024
01:48:29,857 --> 01:48:31,983
But nothing can be said
about her life or death either

1025
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:35,784
She could die tomorrow.
Or maybe after a few months

1026
01:48:36,989 --> 01:48:40,786
Poor Ranjit is half-dead, doing
the rounds of all those doctors

1027
01:48:42,056 --> 01:48:44,319
But who can change the writ of destiny?

1028
01:48:45,124 --> 01:48:47,386
Even the astrologers have
predicted his wife's death

1029
01:48:48,324 --> 01:48:50,257
She has only a few months to live

1030
01:48:51,058 --> 01:48:54,421
lf he seeks my hand in this state,
what is my duty?

1031
01:48:57,523 --> 01:48:59,456
who told you that his wife is so ill?

1032
01:48:59,791 --> 01:49:02,018
Ranjit himself told me.
- Ranjit did?

1033
01:49:02,357 --> 01:49:04,482
Yes. He tells me everything

1034
01:49:05,091 --> 01:49:07,022
About his joys and sorrows

1035
01:49:10,091 --> 01:49:13,489
You trust his word so much?
- Why not?

1036
01:49:14,758 --> 01:49:16,690
Have you met his wife?

1037
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:18,522
No

1038
01:49:18,791 --> 01:49:20,416
would you like to meet her?
- Certainly

1039
01:49:22,091 --> 01:49:24,612
So meet her.
- Where? Do you know her?

1040
01:49:28,791 --> 01:49:30,722
l'm Ranjit's wife

1041
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:42,388
Hey darling! Great news! Promotion!

1042
01:49:42,925 --> 01:49:45,049
l'm now the deputy general manager!

1043
01:49:45,557 --> 01:49:47,489
lsn't that good news?

1044
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:52,557
l'll give you the other good news.
- Sure, go ahead

1045
01:49:53,124 --> 01:49:55,056
The doctors have given up

1046
01:49:55,357 --> 01:49:58,448
The astrologers have said that
l'm going to die in a few months

1047
01:49:59,724 --> 01:50:01,883
why don't you speak?
why are your lips sealed?

1048
01:50:02,491 --> 01:50:04,753
This is your overtime?
This is our happiness and love?

1049
01:50:09,158 --> 01:50:09,885
lt's...

1050
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:14,489
To hell with love that ruins a family

1051
01:50:15,158 --> 01:50:18,351
You want me to die!
- No, listen to me, Shanno...

1052
01:50:18,658 --> 01:50:21,590
Don't call me Shanno! And have
a nice time with your Nimmo!

1053
01:50:22,091 --> 01:50:24,557
wait for my death so you
can finalise a wedding date!

1054
01:50:24,926 --> 01:50:27,084
How can you say such things?
At least hear me out first

1055
01:50:27,325 --> 01:50:29,155
what will l listen to? lsn't this proof enough?

1056
01:50:29,392 --> 01:50:32,085
Now this...
- What defense are you giving?

1057
01:50:34,192 --> 01:50:36,656
l'm the living proof.
- You?

1058
01:50:38,558 --> 01:50:40,115
what have you come here for?

1059
01:50:40,358 --> 01:50:43,916
l'm here to see your ailing wife.
won't you introduce me to her?

1060
01:50:44,192 --> 01:50:45,520
won't you tell me about...

1061
01:50:45,691 --> 01:50:47,123
the prediction of the astrologers, Ranjit?

1062
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:50,289
weren't you ashamed to betray me?
- Weren't you ashamed to ruin my home?

1063
01:50:50,524 --> 01:50:52,013
weren't you ashamed to break my heart?

1064
01:50:52,191 --> 01:50:53,919
weren't you ashamed to betray my love?

1065
01:50:54,192 --> 01:50:56,622
Now look... the two of
you are making a mistake

1066
01:50:56,858 --> 01:50:58,448
Now say you're not Ranjit.
- And l'm not Nirmala

1067
01:50:58,658 --> 01:51:01,920
And l'm not Sharda either!
- lt's like this

1068
01:51:03,458 --> 01:51:06,549
You are Sharda, no doubt.
And you're Nirmala too

1069
01:51:07,292 --> 01:51:10,417
l'm the bloody idiot out here!

1070
01:51:11,225 --> 01:51:13,952
l'm an ass! A bloody dog!

1071
01:51:16,225 --> 01:51:17,691
Forgive me! Please!

1072
01:51:17,925 --> 01:51:20,153
The two of you must please forgive me!

1073
01:51:36,392 --> 01:51:40,347
l can't understand how you could
fall for a man double your age

1074
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:45,182
Men my age, have love alone.
They don't have any money

1075
01:51:48,659 --> 01:51:52,785
l'm a middle-class girl.
when l look at the affluent...

1076
01:51:53,259 --> 01:51:56,191
l feel like possessing everything too

1077
01:51:57,525 --> 01:52:00,185
All the small comforts and joys

1078
01:52:01,126 --> 01:52:02,989
Love alone doesn't feed your stomach

1079
01:52:03,259 --> 01:52:05,657
For that, you gave away all you had?

1080
01:52:06,025 --> 01:52:08,184
lf l could help it, l wouldn't
even work for a living

1081
01:52:09,259 --> 01:52:11,850
But you can't understand
what state our families are in

1082
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:16,218
Our needs push us to something.
And our hearts, to something else

1083
01:52:17,692 --> 01:52:21,215
when our needs are met,
we turn helpless

1084
01:52:23,293 --> 01:52:27,020
Had l known the truth...

1085
01:52:27,426 --> 01:52:29,358
all this would never have happened

1086
01:52:30,293 --> 01:52:32,225
l can only apologise to you

1087
01:52:34,294 --> 01:52:36,225
May you have a happy family

1088
01:52:37,558 --> 01:52:41,490
Ranjit has betrayed me.
But l haven't betrayed him

1089
01:52:43,293 --> 01:52:45,555
This was my first experience at love

1090
01:52:46,293 --> 01:52:50,851
An experience of true love.
And l've lost everything

1091
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:59,251
The truth is that you've lost a
lover, and l've lost my husband

1092
01:53:00,927 --> 01:53:03,256
And what did Ranjit gain?

1093
01:53:06,327 --> 01:53:08,053
Come with me.
- What happened?

1094
01:53:08,326 --> 01:53:10,849
There's a big mess. Come with
me and make my wife see reason

1095
01:53:11,127 --> 01:53:13,059
But what's all this about?

1096
01:53:13,593 --> 01:53:15,753
Nirmala...
- The secretary?

1097
01:53:17,326 --> 01:53:19,986
l don't know what she has
gone and told my wife

1098
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:23,690
l'm afraid Sharda might do something rash

1099
01:53:24,594 --> 01:53:26,956
Nirmala's bent on ruining my family

1100
01:53:28,359 --> 01:53:30,552
So it's as serious as that?

1101
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:35,288
You ought to have told me.
l'd have destroyed Nirmala

1102
01:53:35,761 --> 01:53:38,691
Anyway, let me go and take a look

1103
01:53:39,493 --> 01:53:43,289
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
l'd happily take the blow for you

1104
01:53:44,027 --> 01:53:48,289
That isn't yours.
- You want my help?

1105
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:50,283
Yes.
- So it's my couplet.

1106
01:53:50,526 --> 01:53:52,459
Hundred per cent!
whose is it then?

1107
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:53,984
Yours
- Let's go

1108
01:53:58,660 --> 01:54:00,592
He won't agree

1109
01:54:00,826 --> 01:54:02,758
So you've brought a lawyer along?

1110
01:54:03,394 --> 01:54:05,985
You don't trust me, do you?
So ask Durrani

1111
01:54:06,394 --> 01:54:09,122
How could you do such a thing?
That's just how Nirmala is

1112
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:11,392
There isn't anyone in the office
she hasn't tried to seduce

1113
01:54:11,727 --> 01:54:14,716
when she couldn't succeed, she
trapped my poor innocent brother

1114
01:54:17,394 --> 01:54:19,325
So that's how it is?
- What else?

1115
01:54:20,193 --> 01:54:24,125
And what's this?
- Diary? Brother's diary?

1116
01:54:24,394 --> 01:54:26,121
Read it

1117
01:54:29,427 --> 01:54:31,689
"Nirmala, you are a beautiful dream"

1118
01:54:33,527 --> 01:54:36,961
"Your body is like the waves in the sea..."

1119
01:54:37,694 --> 01:54:41,353
"your lips are like the wings
of a colorful butterfly..."

1120
01:54:42,428 --> 01:54:44,359
wonderful, brother

1121
01:54:46,094 --> 01:54:47,355
"l sometimes think..."

1122
01:54:47,593 --> 01:54:50,151
"l have been wandering in
search of you for ages..."

1123
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:55,356
"calling out your name...
Nirmala! Nirmala!"

1124
01:54:58,092 --> 01:55:01,889
well done, brother. And l thought
l was the only poet around

1125
01:55:02,626 --> 01:55:05,559
l feel like a moron after
going through your work!

1126
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:09,392
Take me for your disciple...
- No...

1127
01:55:09,627 --> 01:55:11,388
Please!
- No, Nirmala...

1128
01:55:12,894 --> 01:55:14,826
l'll show you something more

1129
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:18,187
Look at this!

1130
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:21,721
wow! what a great pose

1131
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:27,556
That's his mistake. ln love and murder...

1132
01:55:27,794 --> 01:55:31,783
one mustn't ever leave a clue.
And my brother's a class in himself

1133
01:55:32,328 --> 01:55:34,226
He has given you proof!

1134
01:55:35,228 --> 01:55:37,421
Turn around and face me, brother

1135
01:55:39,228 --> 01:55:42,819
You have such a lovely wife.
So how could you do this?

1136
01:55:43,228 --> 01:55:46,422
He can't tell you! He's been
waiting for me to die!

1137
01:55:48,495 --> 01:55:54,428
whatever l've done, Sharda...
l admit. lt was a mistake

1138
01:55:55,228 --> 01:55:57,422
But l shared no intimacy
with the girl

1139
01:55:57,829 --> 01:56:00,419
lt was a platonic relationship

1140
01:56:01,495 --> 01:56:04,290
She needed comfort and security...
- With that...

1141
01:56:04,495 --> 01:56:07,462
you gave her what is only a wife's right

1142
01:56:08,229 --> 01:56:10,251
You could have given her all the money...

1143
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:12,450
but not the love only l am entitled to

1144
01:56:13,527 --> 01:56:16,858
She was in need of a man. Any man.
And l wanted Ranjit alone

1145
01:56:17,528 --> 01:56:20,618
You gave my Ranjit to her!
what do you say now?

1146
01:56:21,128 --> 01:56:25,060
That's exactly why people like me
are still bachelors, sister-in-law

1147
01:56:26,862 --> 01:56:29,327
when married men won't leave girls alone...

1148
01:56:29,528 --> 01:56:32,857
how will we bachelors ever marry?
Anyway, forget it now

1149
01:56:34,194 --> 01:56:37,183
C'mon, brother! Step forward
and ask for her forgiveness

1150
01:56:37,528 --> 01:56:39,460
Promise her that you will
never make this mistake again

1151
01:56:41,361 --> 01:56:43,293
l've already apologised to her, Durrani

1152
01:56:43,762 --> 01:56:45,694
But she won't forgive me

1153
01:56:46,361 --> 01:56:48,827
what other right does a woman
have, except to forgive?

1154
01:56:50,562 --> 01:56:52,084
Sister-in-law...

1155
01:57:07,695 --> 01:57:11,492
won't you ever forgive me, Sharda?

1156
01:57:15,129 --> 01:57:17,527
Even if l do, we can't share
the same relationship again

1157
01:57:17,863 --> 01:57:21,260
Please don't say that, Sharda.
Give me any punishment you want to

1158
01:57:22,596 --> 01:57:25,925
You have given me a punishment

1159
01:57:27,796 --> 01:57:32,319
when one forsakes his
first love for a second...

1160
01:57:32,595 --> 01:57:34,925
it paves the way for a third and a fourth

1161
01:57:35,929 --> 01:57:37,862
But he can never return to his first love

1162
01:57:40,395 --> 01:57:44,851
Ranjit, my body still smells of you

1163
01:57:46,595 --> 01:57:49,959
But my smell no longer lingers in yours

1164
01:57:53,628 --> 01:57:57,062
Sharda, even God forgives one trespass

1165
01:57:58,529 --> 01:58:02,017
l swear it on you. l will
be the same Ranjit again

1166
01:58:05,629 --> 01:58:07,560
Let's go away someplace

1167
01:58:08,929 --> 01:58:10,862
Let's stay together in Kashmir

1168
01:58:11,995 --> 01:58:16,019
we'll find our lost love there

1169
01:58:20,963 --> 01:58:24,224
lf not for me, at least for Rinku's sake

1170
01:58:27,562 --> 01:58:29,994
Daddy, l've got Mummy to agree

1171
01:58:31,663 --> 01:58:33,596
Really?
- Yes

1172
01:58:34,196 --> 01:58:37,924
well done, my son! Our visit
to Kashmir is certainly on

1173
01:58:38,196 --> 01:58:39,288
when?

1174
01:58:39,664 --> 01:58:41,595
l'll apply for leave today.

1175
01:58:42,063 --> 01:58:44,586
we'll leave next Sunday.
- First show me the tickets

1176
01:58:45,663 --> 01:58:48,391
l'll buy the tickets today, son.
l'll show it to you tomorrow

1177
01:59:03,863 --> 01:59:06,624
won't you button my coat today?
- What's the point?

1178
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:10,826
You will open it when you're out.
- l won't anymore. l promise

1179
01:59:39,997 --> 01:59:41,860
Did you send for me, brother?

1180
01:59:42,162 --> 01:59:46,096
Yes, Durrani. There's 5333
rupees lying in my account

1181
01:59:46,730 --> 01:59:48,662
Please send that to me

1182
01:59:49,130 --> 01:59:52,654
And send my leave application to the G.M.

1183
01:59:53,064 --> 01:59:54,530
Leave?
- Yes

1184
01:59:54,830 --> 01:59:57,523
l'm taking my wife and kid to Kashmir

1185
01:59:58,531 --> 02:00:03,861
A very good thing too. No better
way of letting the wounds heal

1186
02:00:04,164 --> 02:00:06,095
l'll send the money to you

1187
02:00:18,397 --> 02:00:21,692
You're here?
- To leave

1188
02:00:24,463 --> 02:00:26,690
My resignation letter.
Please give it to the boss

1189
02:00:28,764 --> 02:00:30,354
One moment

1190
02:00:31,096 --> 02:00:33,029
Please come with me

1191
02:00:35,797 --> 02:00:37,457
Go on.
- No

1192
02:00:37,798 --> 02:00:39,729
Go on, l say.
And take this

1193
02:01:07,665 --> 02:01:13,256
lf you could accept my resignation
and pay me my dues, l'd be grateful

1194
02:01:17,298 --> 02:01:19,764
Sit down.
- No, l'm all right

1195
02:01:22,830 --> 02:01:27,763
l feel strange to accept your resignation

1196
02:01:30,165 --> 02:01:32,755
But maybe this is
what is best for us

1197
02:01:34,264 --> 02:01:37,752
lf you come to the office and we meet...

1198
02:01:38,231 --> 02:01:41,197
l might weaken yet again

1199
02:01:42,864 --> 02:01:48,798
But please do not misunderstand me.
- Let's not talk about all that

1200
02:01:50,198 --> 02:01:53,789
l need the money very badly.
Please have it paid to me right now

1201
02:01:55,032 --> 02:01:57,589
why?
- My grandpa's in a bad way

1202
02:01:58,865 --> 02:02:00,797
The operation must take place immediately

1203
02:02:01,864 --> 02:02:04,296
l've got to go to my uncle in
Nagpur to raise the money

1204
02:02:06,865 --> 02:02:09,127
You will get your money right now

1205
02:02:10,197 --> 02:02:12,789
But please forgive me, Nirmala

1206
02:02:13,399 --> 02:02:14,830
Listen...

1207
02:02:20,898 --> 02:02:25,159
l want to meet you one last time.
l've got to discuss something

1208
02:02:25,698 --> 02:02:31,393
Discuss it right here
- Here, in the office?

1209
02:02:32,599 --> 02:02:34,826
l'll wait for you at Gazebo at 5.
- l'm not coming

1210
02:02:36,899 --> 02:02:38,831
Please. For my sake

1211
02:03:14,933 --> 02:03:18,865
Nobody helps you when
you're in trouble, Nimmo

1212
02:03:19,832 --> 02:03:23,286
Had they to help, wouldn't
they have sent us the money?

1213
02:03:24,365 --> 02:03:27,297
You will go and ask for the
money and return humiliated

1214
02:03:28,198 --> 02:03:29,687
Don't go

1215
02:03:29,966 --> 02:03:31,898
The operation must take place, grandpa.

1216
02:03:35,265 --> 02:03:38,061
l'll go and meet uncle.
- Don't go

1217
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:42,059
Your grandpa's right.
You mustn't go

1218
02:03:43,132 --> 02:03:45,291
How will the operation take place?
where will the money come from?

1219
02:03:49,966 --> 02:03:52,694
Please manage with this. lt's 5333

1220
02:03:54,999 --> 02:03:56,932
Why must l accept your money?

1221
02:04:00,166 --> 02:04:02,927
l'm terribly ashamed of myself

1222
02:04:04,499 --> 02:04:07,933
This good deed might make me feel better

1223
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:13,929
Listen...

1224
02:04:14,165 --> 02:04:16,927
who was this angel, dear?

1225
02:04:29,299 --> 02:04:32,754
How will l go home?
what will l tell them?

1226
02:05:06,566 --> 02:05:08,259
You?
- Yes

1227
02:05:14,267 --> 02:05:16,199
Please don't ask me to sit down

1228
02:05:17,067 --> 02:05:21,329
l have apologised to you. But l've
come to make up for my mistake

1229
02:05:23,068 --> 02:05:26,999
l really regret falling for Ranjit's tale of woes

1230
02:05:28,134 --> 02:05:31,725
without even thinking that there
could be no logical end to it

1231
02:05:33,068 --> 02:05:36,032
But l don't want to take this drama any further

1232
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:39,432
The drama has already ended

1233
02:05:39,833 --> 02:05:42,026
Not as yet. There's more to it

1234
02:05:45,433 --> 02:05:48,025
Please take this 5333 Rupees

1235
02:05:50,433 --> 02:05:52,366
Money? what for?

1236
02:05:53,266 --> 02:05:55,358
Ranjit has paid me a price for the betrayal

1237
02:05:55,767 --> 02:05:57,461
A price?
- Yes, a price

1238
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:03,032
The price Ranjit has put on
my love, is rightfully yours

1239
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:06,698
lt's your money. Not mine

1240
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:11,866
lt can't put together my broken heart

1241
02:06:12,633 --> 02:06:16,067
But it could yet mend your broken home

1242
02:06:37,401 --> 02:06:39,334
Daddy, tickets?

1243
02:06:46,167 --> 02:06:50,361
Didn't you say l'm a liar and a cheat, my son?

1244
02:06:51,367 --> 02:06:52,890
You were right.

1245
02:06:53,168 --> 02:06:57,099
But we're going to Kashmir, aren't we?
- No, son. l'm sorry.

1246
02:06:57,434 --> 02:07:00,696
Not this time.
- l've told my friends...

1247
02:07:00,867 --> 02:07:03,800
that we're going to Kashmir!
what will l tell them now?

1248
02:07:04,434 --> 02:07:07,831
You always let me down.
- Listen, son...

1249
02:07:10,501 --> 02:07:13,093
what will you say to your son, except sorry?

1250
02:07:13,567 --> 02:07:16,125
lf Nirmala had made a wish,
you'd sell your house for her

1251
02:07:17,201 --> 02:07:19,826
What happened?
- What would happen?

1252
02:07:20,567 --> 02:07:22,500
You gave her the money you had saved?

1253
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:28,394
When did l give it to her?
She conned me out of it

1254
02:07:28,733 --> 02:07:30,927
Conned you? And you're a wiser man now?

1255
02:07:32,668 --> 02:07:34,395
Oh yes, Sharda

1256
02:07:38,201 --> 02:07:42,395
l realise today that a wife is always a wife

1257
02:07:43,535 --> 02:07:47,330
And the other woman is the
one who ruins the home

1258
02:07:48,234 --> 02:07:50,667
l've begun to hate Nirmala

1259
02:07:53,035 --> 02:07:54,968
Hate her?
- Yes, hate her!

1260
02:07:56,236 --> 02:07:58,167
You're saying wise things today

1261
02:07:59,136 --> 02:08:00,397
What was wrong...

1262
02:08:00,569 --> 02:08:04,331
when you fell in love with her?
- l... l was an ass then!

1263
02:08:04,969 --> 02:08:07,491
My brains weren't working!
- And now?

1264
02:08:09,235 --> 02:08:12,167
Do you want to hear
What she did to me?

1265
02:08:14,069 --> 02:08:16,000
Let me hear this story too, Ranjit

1266
02:08:16,234 --> 02:08:18,167
Stories are all over, Sharda

1267
02:08:19,702 --> 02:08:21,997
What l'm telling you now is the truth

1268
02:08:23,268 --> 02:08:26,461
She came to the office today. She
threatened to give me a bad name

1269
02:08:27,168 --> 02:08:28,532
Actually, she wanted money

1270
02:08:29,268 --> 02:08:31,859
She was faking love earlier,
for the sake of money

1271
02:08:32,168 --> 02:08:34,191
But today, she straight
away got down to blackmail

1272
02:08:35,001 --> 02:08:37,593
And she conned you of 5333 rupees...

1273
02:08:37,936 --> 02:08:40,060
the money you had withdrawn
for our Kashmir trip

1274
02:08:40,368 --> 02:08:42,994
Yes. That's right

1275
02:08:43,369 --> 02:08:46,596
Stop it, Ranjit. Why are you
slandering Nirmala's name ?

1276
02:08:47,936 --> 02:08:50,731
You think l'll be happy if you bad-mouth her?

1277
02:08:52,402 --> 02:08:54,561
This is the money, isn't it?

1278
02:08:56,303 --> 02:08:58,700
The money...? with you?

1279
02:09:00,202 --> 02:09:02,725
Yes. Nirmala came here and
personally gave it to me

1280
02:09:03,568 --> 02:09:05,364
But why?

1281
02:09:05,703 --> 02:09:09,498
So that this money may
mend our broken home

1282
02:09:10,568 --> 02:09:14,228
So that it may prevent it from being shattered

1283
02:09:15,303 --> 02:09:18,235
And you are accusing her.
You ought to be ashamed

1284
02:09:19,002 --> 02:09:23,230
What was it that you could not tell me?

1285
02:09:24,303 --> 02:09:26,632
You were the one who
gave Nirmala this money

1286
02:09:27,602 --> 02:09:34,934
Ranjit, when man gets used to lying...

1287
02:09:35,337 --> 02:09:39,665
his soul weakens and he
can't live truthfully anymore

1288
02:09:41,335 --> 02:09:43,268
Nirmala is an angel, Ranjit

1289
02:09:43,835 --> 02:09:46,426
lt's man who actually spoils woman

1290
02:09:47,335 --> 02:09:49,665
lt's man who ruins her

1291
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:53,268
You have ruined Nirmala.
You have destroyed me

1292
02:09:53,635 --> 02:09:56,261
You have ruined this home. l'm
not going to live here anymore!

1293
02:09:59,469 --> 02:10:01,094
Sharda, listen...

1294
02:10:22,103 --> 02:10:24,035
Can't you forgive me?

1295
02:10:28,369 --> 02:10:30,631
Mummy, where are you going?

1296
02:10:33,269 --> 02:10:35,497
Daddy, where is Mummy going?

1297
02:10:40,804 --> 02:10:42,894
Mummy, tell me where you are going

1298
02:10:48,569 --> 02:10:51,331
Nowhere, my son. Nowhere!

1299
02:12:18,903 --> 02:12:22,098
Brother, everything okay?
- Everything's okay

1300
02:12:33,937 --> 02:12:36,767
There's something l must tell you, Durrani

1301
02:12:37,804 --> 02:12:40,736
There's a basic difference
between man and woman

1302
02:12:42,103 --> 02:12:44,195
A woman will relax once she has found love...

1303
02:12:44,505 --> 02:12:46,834
and man will go around distributing his love

1304
02:12:47,438 --> 02:12:50,302
That's the observation of the elite, brother

1305
02:12:50,871 --> 02:12:52,996
lt won't apply to people like me

1306
02:12:55,538 --> 02:13:01,471
All said and done, a woman can
love only one man at a given time

1307
02:13:02,538 --> 02:13:06,026
And this species called man...

1308
02:13:06,338 --> 02:13:07,861
he has such a large heart...

1309
02:13:08,105 --> 02:13:12,036
that he goes about loving many...

1310
02:13:12,405 --> 02:13:16,462
That's okay. But you must
lead an honest life now

1311
02:13:17,338 --> 02:13:19,463
From the office to your house.
That's all

1312
02:13:19,971 --> 02:13:22,302
These are our temples and mosques

1313
02:13:23,005 --> 02:13:25,300
This office is our temple...

1314
02:13:25,638 --> 02:13:27,901
and the idol is back at home

1315
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:32,662
l wish l had an idol too

1316
02:13:33,072 --> 02:13:36,300
That reminds me of a couplet.
Listen carefully

1317
02:13:37,239 --> 02:13:39,362
"The office is my mosque"

1318
02:13:39,737 --> 02:13:41,670
"But there's no one in my bed"

1319
02:13:42,138 --> 02:13:44,297
"l think so often..."

1320
02:13:44,571 --> 02:13:46,662
"that my officer must leave something for me"

1321
02:13:47,571 --> 02:13:52,503
lt's not funny.
- Durrani, this is your couplet

1322
02:13:53,004 --> 02:13:56,300
Thank you! You agree today

1323
02:13:57,271 --> 02:13:59,533
Let's have a betel-leaf to celebrate that!

1324
02:13:59,872 --> 02:14:01,804
Thank you!

1325
02:14:05,606 --> 02:14:07,537
Let me get to work

1326
02:14:40,638 --> 02:14:42,571
l'm your new secretary

1327
02:14:51,638 --> 02:14:54,968
What name did you say?
- Neeta

1328
02:14:59,638 --> 02:15:01,604
Where were you all these days?
- Pardon me?

1329
02:15:02,939 --> 02:15:04,199
Nothing

1330
02:15:09,971 --> 02:15:12,597
Sir, aren't you keeping well?

1331
02:15:16,672 --> 02:15:18,604
What will l tell you?

1332
02:15:20,673 --> 02:15:27,004
Actually, my wife...

1333
02:15:32,472 --> 02:15:34,631
You must lead an honest life

1334
02:15:35,172 --> 02:15:38,968
The office and the home.
Our temples and mosque

1335
02:15:39,639 --> 02:15:40,764
and the idol is back at home
