1
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,862
Tell me, my son!
What was your sin?

2
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,471
I want to kill a girl, Father.

3
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,203
You're like a chocolate boy
who came with a flower bouquet,

4
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,879
it's sin to talk about murders
in church, my son.

5
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,407
Not just bouquet, Father!

6
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,579
I've brought knife also.

7
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:06,219
Son, this is not Chota Shakee
's
den to come with a knife.

8
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,824
It's holy church!

9
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,225
Keep the knife inside the bouquet.

10
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,402
What made you to become murderous extremist?

11
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,972
Father, I'm not an extremist or terrorist.
- Then?

12
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,830
I'm alover!

13
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,574
Make you come after her for 2 years,
taking Rs.2 lakhs from you,

14
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,978
she ran away to US with another man!

15
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,450
That's ‘Ee Hoiullo‘ film, Father.

16
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,916
You style your father's ring and
gifted her lphone,

17
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,760
she used another man's SIM card,

18
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,930
she gave the bill to you
and thrill to that man.

19
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,997
That's 'Bus Stop' film, Father!

20
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,796
Planning to commit suicide,
taking you to a farm house,

21
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,667
she banged you to the wall!

22
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,503
Oh no! That's ‘Prema Kadha Chithram‘ film, Father.

23
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,939
Then, please tell me, what's your story?

24
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,282
A girl hauled and mauled my life, Father.

25
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,782
Did a girl do like that?
- Yes, Father.

26
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,284
Who that girl is?

27
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,985
She's colourful like Kashmir apple!

28
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,988
Did you think of killing her?
This is wrong, my son.

29
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,662
She's not a Kashmir apple, Father.
She's a Kashmora ghost!

30
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,092
If you want see yourself.

31
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,500
How long do you know him?

32
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,770
One week?

33
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,069
Are you so weak to fall for him in aweek?

34
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,842
ls it strong to fall after a year?

35
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,515
Don't use your damn logic.

36
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,742
That's not logic, but his magic.

37
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,351
My foot!

38
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,749
If he has made you fall in aweek,
I'm sure he's aflirt.

39
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,514
Flirt? It means?

40
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,919
He'll use and throw you.

41
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,754
He's not a flirt, he's Mr.Perfect!

42
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,487
My foot! He's a flirt!
I'll prove it.

43
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,029
Will you prove it?
How?

44
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,459
ls he vegetarian or non-vegetarian?

45
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,630
Then, he'll surely do only
non-vegetarian things.

46
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,497
When he talks to you,
where does he look at you?

47
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,766
Where will he see?

48
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:41,138
I mean whether sees your face or
elsewhere while talking to you.

49
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,947
Actually, he's too shy.

50
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,380
He always bows his head and
talks to me watching my hands.

51
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,952
He loves this locket so much.

52
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,454
You fool! That's not shyness,
I'm sure that is that thing only.

53
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,557
What do you mean by that thing?

54
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,659
I mean he's a flirt.
- ls it?

55
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,488
Yes !

56
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,392
Does he wear torn jeans
or formal pants?

57
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,499
He wears torn jeans.

58
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,725
Then, he has no discipline in his life.

59
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,904
Okay, are his eyes always red?

60
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,168
By studying always.
- No, by drinking always.

61
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,907
Does he chew gum always?
- Yes, very stylishly.

62
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,583
Then, he's a chain smoker.
- ls it?

63
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,117
Surprize for everything.
- Anyway, how do you know all this?

64
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,580
Sigmund Freud male psychology.

65
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,021
Sigmund Fraud?
ls he also fraud?

66
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:32,594
You devil! He's not fraud,
he's father of psychology.

67
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,590
Listen to me, I'm sure he's aflirt.

68
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,599
Leave his hand immediately and
wash your hands with dettol.

69
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:46,533
If girls of this country follow
this silly girl's psychology,

70
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:51,978
boys will become church fathers
instead of becoming father to children.

71
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,446
Like me!

72
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:58,179
By the way who is that young scapegoat
who fell in love with that young girl?

73
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:24,081
Are you that girl's boy friend?
- Yes, it's me, Father.

74
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,020
That side a girl...

75
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,055
This side a boy...

76
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,750
Watch their love story...

77
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:42,658
That side Romeo.-.
This side Juliet...

78
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,996
Head their love story...

79
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,045
Beautiful colours...

80
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,903
Carried by new things and new music...

81
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,972
Like sweet dreams of yellow journals...

82
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,873
It's a love story with sweet and
lovely imaginations...

83
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,211
Better than Facebook and
more twisting that Twitter...

84
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,277
Speeder than Macbook and
faster than mobile games...

85
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,984
It's a love story of mad sizes
and prizes...

86
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:40,215
It's a new experience...

87
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,323
It's very happy...

88
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:49,326
Surprizing is their nature...
Expecting is gift voucher...

89
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,295
If you give a break,
they'll break-up...

90
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,686
Do you always wear these clothes only?

91
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,762
I'll change it every day.

92
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,762
Because you get discipline.
- No, it may stink.

93
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,965
Are you eyes always red?
- Hot blooded youth!

94
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,264
Do you always chew gum?

95
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,336
Why are you torturing me
so many questions, dear?

96
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:38,281
My friend told me boys doing
all this are generally flirts.

97
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,340
Flirt?

98
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,818
Me?

99
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,946
Who told you that?

100
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:48,024
Chitra...Chitra Balasubramanyam,
my close friend.

101
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,694
Chitra Balasubramanyam?

102
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,156
Her name is horrible.

103
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,730
Do you know she's an expert of
Sigmund Freud psychology?

104
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,960
That's not Freud psychology but
your friend Chitra's fraud psychology.

105
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,299
Sigmund never said anything
about flirts in his books.

106
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,165
Your friend is playing a game
to break us up.

107
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,141
Are you suspecting me
trusting her words?

108
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,645
Look Geetha, I didn't fall in love
with Sigmund Freud's sister.

109
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,908
You!

110
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,243
If you don't trust me, tell me openly.

111
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,146
Let's break up.

112
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,782
That's the matter!

113
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:24,155
He's playing break up drama
after getling caught red handed.

114
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,354
A sincere lover would never
speak like that.

115
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,428
It's confirm ed, he's a flirt!

116
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:32,936
Truth !

117
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,199
Sidhu's phone.

118
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,105
Answer the call and
switch on the speaker.

119
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,334
I'll prove now that he's a flirt.

120
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,671
What are you doing?

121
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,009
I'm talking to my friend.

122
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:45,782
Friend?

123
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,849
ls it that torturing Chitra?

124
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,013
Talk to him.

125
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,117
Will you switch on the speaker?

126
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,694
Cut your friendship with Chitra immediately.

127
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,958
Let's enjoy hugs and kisses from
tomorrow as we did earlier.

128
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,025
Are you doing all this?

129
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,260
I'm telling you.
Why are you looking there?

130
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,369
Look here!
Can you hear me?

131
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,740
say Yes.
_ yes!

132
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,201
Talk to me now!

133
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,068
Talk!

134
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,144
Will you stop wearing torn jeans and
stop eating non-vegetarian food?

135
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:15,972
Are you mad?

136
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,440
You loved me for that, right?

137
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,211
Dump Chitra who reels out
such crap as psychology.

138
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,047
What are you blabbering?

139
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,392
No girl must love aflirt like you.
That's my philosophy.

140
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,728
I know you're next to Geetha.

141
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,396
Don't you've any other work?

142
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,255
After great difficult I've managed
to make a girl fall for me,

143
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,059
will you ruin that?

144
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,170
How can you know the difficulties
of boys in dating girls?

145
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,239
Did you see he trapped you
with great difficulty?

146
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,102
It means he sure has another intention.

147
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:50,441
Yes! Won't lovers hug, kiss and romance?

148
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,942
Did you see how he's getting exposed?

149
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,509
You crooked girl!

150
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,148
Why should I talk to you?

151
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:02,019
Geetha, choose between me
and your friend now!

152
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,920
Tell him, you want me.

153
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:05,828
Tell him.

154
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,865
I don't want you.

155
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,964
Got sense now!

156
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,263
Now cry your heart out like Devadas.

157
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:35,358
For ruining your love with Geetha,
you've decided to kill Chitra.

158
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,794
No, Father.
- No?

159
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,397
I shunned girls but
a girl entered my life.

160
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,296
I'll tell you that story,
please listen, Father.

161
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,400
Tell me, brother.

162
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,228
They sit next to each other and
share laughter together...

163
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,330
They talk on phone for hours and
smile when they meet...

164
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,162
It's a love story of pop corn
eating youngsters...

165
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,571
Young mousiache, mini skirt,
it's pair of bike and scooty...

166
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:27,378
It's a love story of no-holds-barred
couple rocking the pub...

167
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:31,572
They don't have any hurdle
in their flight...

168
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:36,409
They're birds flying in air...

169
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,557
Their story has started
and they'll rock...

170
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,359
Let's watch the film

171
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:08,643
The strange twist in my love story is Sowm ya
who loves me is Chitra's friend.

172
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,921
As usual she spread the
flirt virus to Sowm ya,

173
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,091
she ruined my love story again.

174
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,191
This compliment is for that result.

175
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,884
It's confirmed, he's a flirt.

176
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,222
Flirt? Me?

177
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,328
Oh my God!

178
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,902
You're clear about
what I'd do as a flirt, right?

179
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,267
Tell me, what should I do to prove
I'm a sincere lover?

180
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:33,910
I'll prove that my love is sincere.

181
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,942
You must get at early morning 4 am!

182
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,447
From drinking binge?
- From bed!

183
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,579
Must take bath in cold water.

184
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,382
Bath in cold water?
- Got sinus problem?

185
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,024
No, water problem.

186
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,694
Circumambulate the holy basil.

187
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,452
Will she be beautiful?

188
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,998
I meant Basil plant.

189
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,428
Sin!

190
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:02,530
Go around Baba's temple
108 rounds at 6 am.

191
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:09,440
Stop eating non-vegetarian food and
eat only raw vegetables and greens.

192
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,574
At8
- Stop! Stop it!

193
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,448
I'll try this first, let's discuss
further tests in next sitting.

194
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,283
Bloody life!

195
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,359
What's your fraud boy friend saying?

196
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,194
He says he can't live without me.

197
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,338
What's the time now?
- 6 am!

198
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:39,237
Where would he be now?
- Baba's temple.

199
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,038
No, he would be in bed.

200
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,478
If you want call him and check.
Silly girl!

201
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,593
Where are you Sidhu?

202
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,721
Thatis...in temple.

203
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,658
Are you really in temple, Sidhu?

204
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,733
If you want I'll ring the bell.

205
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,438
Devotional songs are being
played here, listen!

206
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,146
Lo rd Ven k atesh wara' s son g
in Baba's temple?

207
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,687
I heard ringing bells also.

208
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:30,127
It wasn't temple bells but
rang bell in his house.

209
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,522
House bell?

210
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,701
Sorry dear, I missed only that.

211
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,535
What should I do next?
Go around holy basil plant!

212
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,798
I'll prove my sincerity.
Watch it!

213
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,415
Hubby! Ghost!

214
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,147
He didn't go around the holy basil plant.

215
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,452
He cheated you.
- How do you know that?

216
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,721
Only women go around the holy basil plant,
gents don't do it.

217
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,396
He's cheating you, if you want ask him.

218
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,602
Don't men go around holy basil plant?

219
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,804
But why did you ask me do it?

220
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,437
I used to get up at 10 am and
take bath in hot water.

221
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,474
You made me get up at 4 am
and made me bath in cold water.

222
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,643
What's your intention?

223
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,143
You want to love me or kill me?
Tell me.

224
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,839
If you pass these tests,
you're a good boy.

225
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,414
Or else you're just a flirt
who uses girls,

226
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,179
My friend Chitra told me.

227
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:36,258
I mean Chitra Balasubramanyam,
who uses Sigmund Freud to chide others.

228
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,689
ls she your friend?

229
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,323
How do you know her?
- Why not?

230
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:47,095
She's that great woman who is
keeping girls away from my life.

231
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,634
I've understood it clearly.

232
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:53,173
How does she behave with you?
- Very nice.

233
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,438
Does she sit closer to you?
I mean does she touch you?

234
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,513
yes, she puts her hands,
she sits very close to me.

235
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,207
That's not closeness but different!

236
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,717
What are you saying?
- She loves you.

237
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,651
Don't get so shocked!

238
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,155
She ruins the love of boys
and loves girls.

239
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,624
She'll use mad ideas to test lovers
and split them.

240
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,729
If you want ask her.

241
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,461
I said give me.

242
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,572
Tell me.

243
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,804
I'll beat you with slippers.

244
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:30,738
Ch itra!

245
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,750
What did you blabber?
Do we love each other?

246
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,682
Would two girls love each other
in this world?

247
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,583
Why not?

248
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,281
You love her, right?
By creating suspicion between us.

249
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,925
Yes, I do love her.

250
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:47,594
I'll surely love to save girls
from rogues like you.

251
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:50,563
Not to save them but for their warm hugs.

252
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,171
Girls are born for us only.
Not for you.

253
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,937
I'll spread message that you're different
in the city, no entire state.

254
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,370
Get lost!
Do whatsoever you can!

255
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,275
I'll not let any girl fall for you.

256
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,780
If they're next to you,
how can they fall for me?

257
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,954
If you dare come after my friends,
I'll kill you.

258
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,280
Why do I need your lovers?
I don't want her.

259
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,196
You mad girl, I don't mind
if you break up with me.

260
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,596
But please don't believe that cheat girl.

261
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,395
If not your life...

262
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,864
lfl ever see you...
- What will you do?

263
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,232
Will you hug me?

264
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,969
I'm a man, you don't need men, right?

265
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,316
You played havoc with my life,
if I don't kill you,

266
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,882
my name henceforth shall
not be Sidhu.

267
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,378
Get lost!

268
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,312
How dare you cut my phone call!

269
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,620
What's that expression?

270
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,818
Did you hear what did he say?

271
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,392
How could he get the thought that
girls can love each other?

272
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,435
ls he different?
- No, he's very strong.

273
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,238
How do you know that?

274
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,602
Did you...?
- Just said about his appearance.

275
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,404
Anyway it was good riddance.
Come, let's go to sleep.

276
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,842
I'll sleep there.

277
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,850
She's different!

278
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,847
If you're afraid, sleep with me,
don't trust that rogue's words.

279
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,423
I'll not come.

280
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,525
Go!

281
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,730
Now I'm clear without any confusion.

282
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,629
She filled your love story with
ghosts of doubts,

283
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:35,271
and for hurting your pure heart twice,

284
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,532
you decided to kill Chitra!

285
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,342
Not again!

286
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,275
This is nothing, the real love story
happened after this, Father.

287
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,276
Heal love story?

288
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:48,510
Tell me how many love stories are
there at least roughly!

289
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,618
Please listen to me, Father.
- Go ahead!

290
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:16,712
O Myna...who are you?

291
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:21,408
If beauty is measured in height,
are you Everest?

292
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:27,015
O Myna, whatever may be your name?

293
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:31,327
You will make this world
call you an angel...

294
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:37,933
Trust me, this looks like a myth...

295
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:42,869
This is like dream coming true...

296
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:48,011
Like a flash of lightning...

297
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,679
You struck and took me away with you...

298
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:27,481
You appear familiar and
that's not enough for me...

299
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:32,554
If you explain, what do you look like?

300
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:37,694
Once if I see you, I can never forget...

301
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:43,561
There's no brush to paint your beauty...

302
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:51,402
Don't know from which planet
you came down to earth....

303
00:23:53,933 --> 00:24:01,784
When will you come again into my path?

304
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:53,460
I loved many girls till now but
was never serious with anyone...

305
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,659
ﬁrst time I saw you today and
I've started believing love...

306
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:13,751
You're hiding in me and
giving wings to my imaginations...

307
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:23,497
You pushed me as a companion to
go ahead in these paths of wishes...

308
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,075
He refused to enter temple
and said he'll sit outside.

309
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,209
When did he come inside?

310
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,045
Why is he running like that?

311
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,978
Catch him!
- Stop, Sidhu!

312
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,438
Stop...s1op....
- Mother...a girl...

313
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:13,849
Stop...s1op....
- Mother...a girl...

314
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,713
which girl?
- The girl in yellow half sari.

315
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,217
Something is wrong with him,
let's take him away.

316
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,557
Mother....a girl...
- Com e, son.

317
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:50,646
My damn fate, why did I say Athreya
and Sri Sri?

318
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:51,787
Priest!

319
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,256
I want a small information.
- Go ahead.

320
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,117
Yesterday my uncle came to the temple.

321
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,695
My mother and uncle are having
a feud for long time.

322
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,860
By the timel could meet him,
heleft the temple.

323
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,258
I couldn't find him again.

324
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,595
Don't try to fool me, son!

325
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:12,841
Your uncle has a grown up daughter of
your height wearing yellow half sari, right?

326
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:14,067
Yes, how do you know that?

327
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,872
Don't use your youth antics on me.

328
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:20,149
Since you couldn't find in Google,
did you come to the temple?

329
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:25,617
This temple has more boys
chasing girls than real devotees.

330
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:29,623
You didn't offer prayers in temple
but chased an angel outside.

331
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,193
So I expected you'd come here.

332
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,627
Sir, you know everything.

333
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,095
They gave the chocolate
but not allowing me to eat.

334
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,635
Please give me her address.
- Stay away, don't defile me.

335
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:47,136
For offering prayers,
I ask only their race and stars.

336
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,643
I don't ask their address and
go for coffee to their homes.

337
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:55,012
Look, they come here on Fridays
to offer special prayers.

338
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:58,017
Try on Friday, you may get lucky
on some Friday.

339
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,382
Try your luck.

340
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,915
Thank you, priest.

341
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,280
What's it, mother?

342
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,355
Your father has left to office also.

343
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,695
Were you guarding house all night
like a watchman without sleeping?

344
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,763
Did you remember about
all your loitering?

345
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:44,434
Not loitering, mom.
Thinking about the girl in temple.

346
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:49,369
Though two girls proposed and
broke up, I didn't mind much.

347
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,706
But I'm unable to forget this girl, mom.

348
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,037
I saw her there but
she's in my heart now.

349
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,473
I don't know how to feel, mom.

350
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,315
Neither I know her nor talked to her.

351
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,142
But still why this feeling?

352
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,719
Entire nightl couldnit sleep,
shewas moving before my eyes, mom.

353
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:09,883
Whenever I remember her,
I feel unbearable pain here, mom.

354
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:14,326
You get such feelings only
when you find your soul mate.

355
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,267
Geetha and Sowmya in your
Inter years was just attraction.

356
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,835
What you saw today in temple
is real love.

357
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:23,131
That's why you're feeling so much.

358
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,134
If you're feeling so much for
seeing her once,

359
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,277
if she talks to you or loves you?

360
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:29,502
Mother!

361
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:35,211
God showed you the girl in temple,
if you both are destined to meet,

362
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:36,852
she'll come searching you.

363
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,352
If not you'll go searching her.

364
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,254
I'm sure you both will fall in love.

365
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:44,291
Okay?

366
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:45,928
Ours is also love marriage.

367
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,031
You've my full support for your love.
Okay?

368
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:55,299
Don't know how far away we are
though very near?

369
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:59,874
Earth and sky will never meet...

370
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:04,172
There's unknown burden in
the paths we go...

371
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:09,443
Are days and moonlit nights
lovely enemies?

372
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,061
Anger and fights of the past...

373
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:29,296
That is what they know...

374
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,135
Love will grow in future...

375
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:37,542
Love...love...love...

376
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:27,386
In the age of dreams,
you fall in love...

377
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:36,404
You'll be blessed with a boon
oflifelong companion of life...

378
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:45,413
Though she's with you like your shadow,
you're vexed with yourself...

379
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:53,386
Though chill wind touches,
you still can't recognize it...

380
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,368
Not her, she's not of my range.

381
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:06,433
<i>Study,!</i>

382
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,101
In mad rush I crossed my darling.

383
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:15,577
Spell it.

384
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,314
I didn't ask you to repeat, spell it.

385
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,574
You need feeling
why do you want spelling?

386
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,976
Who are you?
- Speciator!

387
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:27,123
I'm a spectator watching you from
a distance for the past 4 months.

388
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:30,020
If you say okay, this spectator
will become your lover.

389
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:30,989
For whom?

390
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,457
Why would I tell you if it's someone else?

391
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,652
For you only!

392
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,089
You were watching me for 4 moths
to become my lover,

393
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,393
from front or back?

394
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,128
From back only!
I didn't dare to face you.

395
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:48,442
To sync with your shyness or
to get impressed for your words,

396
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,274
if we've to becom e lovers,
spectators watching musi approve it.

397
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,951
Shall I request them to send SMS?

398
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,313
Not those audience,
there are 10 people in next class.

399
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,511
They must like you.

400
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:04,456
When we both go around, they mustn't think
how could this fool get such a girl!

401
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,152
Everything is fine, but
do you need to use that fool word?

402
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,524
It is necessary.
- Then, okay.

403
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,631
Tell your love for meto my friends.

404
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,299
What if they agree?
- I'll sit in your heart.

405
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,300
What if they refuse?

406
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,495
I'll shave your head, kick you
and send you in goods train.

407
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:17,730
On my head, right?

408
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,234
Com e.

409
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,149
Are they your friends?
Should I prove myself before them?

410
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,588
Mahesh? He?

411
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,257
He's like soda water bottle without fizz.

412
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,724
Please don't get angry.

413
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,024
Look at him properly.

414
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,165
Specs, shoes brought from roadside shop.

415
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,766
Rolled gold chain.

416
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:49,494
Every item on his body is waiting
eagerly to see me.

417
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,106
Can't you see that?
- No!

418
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:55,301
Actually we don't see him at all!
He's so dark!

419
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,211
Rogues like him...

420
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:00,408
Yes» you!

421
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,685
If they charm us with magic of love,
what are we doing?

422
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,419
We get cheated and end up in tears.

423
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,285
That's why I got this item boy
as an example.

424
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:12,793
If anyone says love at first sight,
what should we do?

425
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,186
We'll hit with slippers.

426
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:17,198
You shedevils!

427
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,130
Girls like you would never get married.

428
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,302
You'll never go on honeymoon.

429
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:23,371
Your lives will go waste without any use.

430
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:24,800
Go man!

431
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,543
ls Shirish too like him?

432
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:31,770
Come, lefs go.

433
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,821
Oh no, she's coming here.
Shall I throw it? No!

434
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,657
Shall I give it?

435
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,584
'l'
cket...ticket...

436
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,127
Sell in theatre,
what are you doing here?

437
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,764
This is for us.

438
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,590
I called you on phone,
did you keep it in vibration mode?

439
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:56,068
I'll keep in vibration mode or raise
hell with ring tome, what bothers you?

440
00:34:56,261 --> 00:35:01,074
Malayalam dubbed film, ‘Hachcha Hambola‘.

441
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,073
Action sentiment film,
theatre is empty.

442
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:03,803
Shall we go?

443
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,171
Will you come as friend and
behave like lover?

444
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:07,441
You've too many things.

445
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,415
Not big but very small, touch it.

446
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:15,089
Today's friends are tomorrow's lovers,
thatis why!

447
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,260
Neither today nor tomorrow,
you can never be my lover.

448
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,827
No, say something else, is that final?
- Final!

449
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:24,359
You speak well normally,
why do you stammer if it is love?

450
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,460
Whom should I take to the film now?

451
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:52,125
Feel my love as anger...

452
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,558
Feel my love as hatred...

453
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:57,131
Feel my love as curse...

454
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,131
My dear, feel my love...

455
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,734
Why are you after me?

456
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:04,464
We both are same pinch.
- Same pinch?

457
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:08,301
He's already in love problem s,
if he hits you...

458
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,406
Raja, you don't have to love me.

459
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,588
Feel my love as void or
any damn thing...

460
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,426
Buddy!

461
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,327
Why is your face so dull?

462
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,333
I love Janaki for the past 6 months.

463
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,372
But there's no response from her side.

464
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,546
I'm also asking you to cometo my room,
did you come at least once?

465
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,273
If you talk between, I'll cut your throat.

466
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:49,451
Shut up!

467
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,720
Why did you hide this matter till now?

468
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:56,290
It's love matter,
I wanted to keep it secret.

469
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,791
Yes, you don't see friends
when you're in love.

470
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,521
But if you face problems in love,
you come to friends.

471
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,631
Tell me the matter in detail.

472
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,564
Why are you carrying garbage
in your bag?

473
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,707
Shut up! I'll rip you!

474
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,969
This is not garbage but
my Janaki's memoirs.

475
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,382
Look at this!
Do you know what this is?

476
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:20,712
<i>NU! ma“!</i>

477
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:25,217
Jasmine that fell from myJanakFs hair
6 months ago.

478
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:25,979
Do you know what this is?

479
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,814
Ice cream cup thrown away by
my Janaki 4 months ago.

480
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,294
Do you know what this is?

481
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:35,693
Janaki's slipper that got torn
while boarding bus <i>3</i> months ago.

482
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,389
I'll hit you with slipper
if you say one more word.

483
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:43,403
You went after her for 6 months and
picked up empty cups and slippers.

484
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,007
If you don't express your love
to her tomorrow,

485
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,311
I'll make you drink poison
mixed beer, be careful.

486
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,916
We're meeting her tomorrow and
you'll express your love.

487
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,789
Buddy, that girl.
- Which girl?

488
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,487
That girl.
- Which girl?

489
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:09,961
Girl in yellow dress.

490
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,864
How beautiful she is!

491
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,764
The girl is not even looking at you!
- That's the problem.

492
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:24,871
She's going away.

493
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,281
Janaki is going away.

494
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,276
Stop g

495
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,981
We mustn't se the girls,
we must make girls see us.

496
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,287
What do you want me to do now?

497
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,754
Simple, follow the formula of
the film ‘Prem adesam‘.

498
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,450
Formula of ‘Premadesam?
What's that?

499
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,029
If bus reaches high speed,
if we chase and board it,

500
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:44,424
people in the bus look at you
like a hero, right?

501
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,693
The girl will automatically
become your heroine.

502
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:47,665
Really?

503
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,397
Then, watch now!
Start the count.

504
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:05,814
Formula has worked out!

505
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,427
Bye sister!

506
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,434
Instead of seeing me,
what is she looking at?

507
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,879
I asked him unnecessarily.

508
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:09,378
How am I to tell my heart's love?
- Why is he coming here?

509
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,451
Lovely sweet words...

510
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,054
Why this drinking session?

511
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,618
What happened?
Why your face is dull?

512
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,383
ls your love success or failure?

513
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:21,656
Go away, please.

514
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,563
You said film formula and made me
catch running bus like Vadivelu,

515
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,798
if you come running like Abbas in
slow motion, why would Janaki love me?

516
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,670
Why should I run risking my life?

517
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:38,006
What's your bad intention in this?

518
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:43,744
The girl I saw in temple,
she was going away on Vespa scooter,

519
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:47,754
I tried to catch her up...
- You tried and stopped getting tired.

520
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,790
She appears and disappears immediately.

521
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,859
Don't tell me the story of the film 'Tholi Prema',

522
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,088
I've seen the film with Pavan Kalyan
and Keerthi Heddy.

523
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,093
Missing every time to the
director's com fort.

524
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:02,927
When there so much technology of
phones, Facebook, Twitter, What's app!

525
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,108
If we use it correctly,
we can find the girl by evening.

526
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,503
But please don't talk slow
like an art film hero.

527
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,204
It hurts me.

528
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:18,120
I've tried everything and failed.

529
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,113
You keep shut.

530
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,012
<i>0K9!‘</i>

531
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:24,057
Janaki is before me,
so fix her up for me.

532
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,991
Then, let's together find your eluding lover.

533
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:35,001
Then, we both along with our lovers
can paint this town red.

534
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:39,141
Call Janaki to canteen tomorrow at 9 am.

535
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,942
What's he planning this time?
Why?

536
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,612
Don't act like a comedy artiste,
act like a character artiste.

537
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,474
I'll fix your love.

538
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,957
My slipper! When did you take it?
Tell me!

539
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:02,996
Not just your slipper but chocolate paper,
ice cream cup, coke tin,

540
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,065
every trash you left behind,

541
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,564
he has spent 6 months
collecting all this.

542
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,499
Why did you take it without telling me?

543
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,604
This is not things to buy from
shop after telling you.

544
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,173
You used and threw it.

545
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,674
You mus1n't see it as trash,

546
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,177
but you must see his feelings
while collecting this,

547
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,713
I felt so much!

548
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,614
After spending 6 months
with one sided love,

549
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:28,086
at last he dared to tell you and
bought film tickets,

550
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,952
you tore and threw it on his face.

551
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:31,719
Useless bugger!

552
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,623
He doesn't even know to
express his love.

553
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:39,228
There's mass and class in
expressing love but not in love.

554
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,729
All are equal!

555
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,804
If a boy falls in love,
you know it first than him.

556
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,068
Why is she staring at him?

557
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:51,906
I'll not force you to love him,

558
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:56,074
even if you refuse him now, he has
faith that you'll love him someday.

559
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,048
You must understand his sincerity.

560
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,985
Have you understood it?

561
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,651
She's reacting differently.

562
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:09,297
If a girl refuses a boy's love, they tend
to share the sorrow with beer bottle.

563
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:10,223
Yes.

564
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,091
Please don't push him to that situation.

565
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:17,295
Any worker would work
only for 8 hours a day.

566
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,969
But he works all he 24 hours.

567
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,735
When did I go to work?
- Theiob of your lover!

568
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,242
Yes, I'm doing.

569
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,105
Janaki, please try to understand his love.

570
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:28,750
Please share your love with him.

571
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,748
How much he loves love,
he'll love you more than that,

572
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,581
he'll look after you with love.

573
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,289
Yes, I do.

574
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:39,753
Give him life with yes or
ditch him with no,

575
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:40,952
it's your wish.

576
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,759
Hello, I did all that, please look at me.

577
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,266
Why is she not looking a me?

578
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,263
Com e...You delivered the dialogue very well.

579
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,368
That's dialogue from the film 'Manam'.
- 00
s it?

580
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,792
Why the slipper from trash can
is on the dining table?

581
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,822
I expected this!
Is he working with municipality'?

582
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:17,625
No, it seems he collected all this
following me for 6 months.

583
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,098
He would've picked it up
30 minutes before,

584
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:23,295
he's trying to trap lying to you.

585
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,642
Chitra, heis very good boy,
he really loves me.

586
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:30,803
When his friend told me how much
he loves me, I was in tears.

587
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,209
I mean the your real lover
didn't tell you that.

588
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,315
ls your lover dumb?

589
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,153
No.
- Then?

590
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,651
Other language artiste to use
dubbing voice for Telugu.

591
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,414
ls he in love with you or his friend?

592
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,658
He couldn't talk,
so his friend explained me.

593
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:48,126
Mad girl, he's trying his best to trap you.

594
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,424
Can't your foolish brain
understand this?

595
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:54,668
He thinks you'll fall for this trash
and that fraud lover.

596
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,169
Whatever you may say,
had you listened to him ,

597
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,364
I'm sure you'd sayl love you and
fall in love with him.

598
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,334
Me? Love?

599
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,340
Call them again,
let me see how sincere they are!

600
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:09,378
If I like the way he proposes,
I'll unite you both myself.

601
00:45:09,741 --> 00:45:12,017
If not I'll cut it myself.

602
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:14,950
Will you listen to me?
- Okay, I will.

603
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:17,157
Hop on.
- Just a minute.

604
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:18,918
Buddy, my darling is calling.

605
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:20,824
Buddy, please say hello for me.

606
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:24,431
I'm sure she's calling to accept
your love, have a blast!

607
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,427
ls it? Then, I'll talk to her.

608
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:32,101
I liked the way your friend told me
about love.

609
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,368
His sty
e...his expression!

610
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,768
<i>smpnslop...</i>

611
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:40,711
Will you say I love you to him?
I expected this!

612
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,044
You were staring at him all the evening.

613
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,242
I expected this will happen.

614
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:46,183
No...
- What no?

615
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:47,981
Won't you see me if I catch bus
with great difficulty?

616
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,216
Will you speak to him for
saying few words?

617
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:51,450
Talk to him, you both talk to each other.

618
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:53,318
You fool! Listen to me.

619
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:56,727
I told my friend about our love.
She was convinced.

620
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:57,729
ls it?

621
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,266
She's very important person in my life.

622
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,995
She must like you and your behaviour.

623
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:07,068
Come to the same place at same time
tomorrow with your friend

624
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,005
Friend?

625
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:11,905
As he told metoday, tell him to say
the same thing with my friend.

626
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,246
If she's convinced,
we'll not have any problem s.

627
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,919
Won't you accept me unless
your friend accepts me?

628
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,420
If you really love me, just do as I say!

629
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,892
Don't forget your friend must com e.

630
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:27,426
Don't say friend, it hurts me.

631
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,527
If you come alone,
things will be back to square one.

632
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:31,925
<i>0K9!‘</i>

633
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:33,358
What happened?

634
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:37,131
Nothing, it seems she's going to test
my sincerity before her friend.

635
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:39,239
Friend? Who is she?

636
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,774
How do I know?
It seems you too must come.

637
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:44,209
The lover on test must go.

638
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:47,542
You've cleared half the way,
please clear the other half also.

639
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:51,944
If you do it, I'll be with you
to find your dream girl.

640
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,213
Will you?
- Yes.

641
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:54,389
Com e.
- Come.

642
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,459
His dream girl saved my day.

643
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:03,264
May be my girl will visit temple today!

644
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:05,559
Should I go to temple or college?

645
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:07,868
\ﬁsit temple!

646
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,139
Take offering.

647
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,315
No, I'm visiting temple,
I'll take it there.

648
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,540
Temple? You must go to college, right?

649
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:26,980
What did the priest say?
My dream girl would temple every Friday.

650
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:32,354
Do anything but don't neglect
your studies.

651
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,188
Don't worry, mom.

652
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:37,025
Let me find the girl,
I'll get you first rank.

<i>0K9!‘</i>

654
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,062
I'm in temple now.
I'll get late, you carry on.

655
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,858
What are you saying?

656
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,535
You blabbered as you wish yesterday.

657
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,529
You added drama and melodrama
to my love.

658
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,033
Don't worry, just repeat whatever I said.

659
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,404
Even if there are 10 prompters,
I can't say one dialogue.

660
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,547
That too expressing love with Janaki
will make me stammer.

661
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:31,012
If I use any bad word in it,
she'll never see my face again in life.

662
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,551
Look, already I've started to stammer.

663
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,981
I'll fall at your feet, please come.

664
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,557
Use Bluetooth in ear and manage.

665
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,417
I'll be there in an hour.

666
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:44,430
Hey, Janaki is coming.
Please come.

667
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,329
Come on, do as I say.

668
00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:54,403
Did he come?

669
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:55,372
He?

670
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,443
I mean your friend.
Did he come?

671
00:48:57,635 --> 00:48:59,080
He'll com e.

672
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,510
Where's your friend?
- She'll come. You come.

673
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,681
Hi priest!

674
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:09,148
What brings you here again?

675
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,384
I feel sorry for you.

676
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:14,119
Why are you interested in love?

677
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,959
I must meet the girl today, sir.
Please do something.

678
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,498
What can I do?

679
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,601
Other than offering prayers to God.

680
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,597
Then, please offer prayers.

681
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,066
Which prayer if you offer can
make me see her?

682
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:28,937
Which prayer if you offer can
my love succeed?

683
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,168
Offer those prayers, sir.

684
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:32,370
Today I'm offering 1 lakh chant prayer.

685
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:36,279
Anyone who offers this prayer with
devotion, his wish will get fulfilled.

00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,475
Please do it, sir.

687
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:41,020
Not in these clothes, change the dress.

688
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:42,282
Go...go...
- Okay, priest.

689
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:43,218
Go.

690
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,361
ls everything okay there?

691
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,626
Okay?

692
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,062
Don't overact, I'm online.

693
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,069
Talk to her.
- Okay.

694
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,238
Tell me.
- Not you.

695
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:04,470
I'm talking to the girl.
- Okay.

696
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:08,514
ls your Bluetooth on?
- No, body is warm.

697
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:09,650
I'm practicing.

698
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,714
I must tell the dialogues, right?
When will your friend come?

699
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:13,146
Se has gone to the temple, she'll come.

700
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,721
ls your friend in temple?

701
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:27,433
He's here, when are you coming?

702
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:30,265
Don't talk to him ﬁll I come.

703
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:31,496
Keep him away.

704
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:36,176
Are they both there?
- No, he has come alone.

705
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,040
Tell him where's he?

706
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:39,543
Where's your friend?

707
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,381
He's offering prayers, he'll come.

708
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,018
Tell him not to tell lies.

709
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,449
In my language such boys are
called as flirts.

710
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,755
What's going on there?

711
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:50,683
I don't know, they're whispering something.

712
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,083
I can't hear anything.

713
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:56,561
Your friend is very dangerous,
please divert your girl's attention.

714
00:50:56,754 --> 00:51:02,466
Once...cut the phone call.

715
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,695
1 No...it's wrong.

716
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:08,203
Listen to me, if not I'll cut the cal.

717
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,208
No, I'll hold.

718
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,208
What's that sound?

719
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,715
He pressed my hand.
- Give him atight slap.

720
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,055
No problem.
- Why? I feel good.

721
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,157
He has started the games.
Girls go weak here only.

722
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:25,327
If you don't slap him, I'll not comethere.

723
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,562
He's aflirt, slap him!

724
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:29,560
You say like that.
- Slap him!

725
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,061
Hands off me, you flirt!

726
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:35,331
What's that noise?
- That's noise but flirt.

727
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:36,664
Flirt?

728
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:39,664
I'll go home and be there.

729
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:42,641
Switch off that Bluetooth.

730
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,073
Okay, sir.

731
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,673
Close your eyes and make your wish.

732
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:16,435
Such a traditional boy in
this modern time!

733
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:29,384
Boy, open your eyes,
offer this fruit and pray to God.

734
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,734
Priest! That girl!

735
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,299
Move please...

736
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,740
Move that side.

737
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:51,404
Priest, that girl is going away.

738
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:53,479
I'll also go.
- Stop!

739
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:57,881
Once you start the prayers,
you must go midway, it's grave sin.

740
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:01,655
It'll become a curse and
you'll lose the girl forever.

741
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:03,519
Priest, please don't scare me like that.

742
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:05,819
If I lose the girl, I can't live.

743
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:11,755
That girl will not go anywhere.

744
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:14,163
God will test you in situations
like this only.

745
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:17,168
You must pass these tests,
you mustn't run away from it.

746
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,170
You may lose her temporarily now,

747
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:22,833
if you want her for all your life,
you must finish this prayer.

748
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,511
Offer this fruit and pray to God.
Do it.

749
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:27,838
Close your eyes.

750
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,787
Look here!
Concentrate on prayers.

751
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:46,868
Have you com e?
- What happened?

752
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,534
I'm waiting to get crushed
under your bike.

753
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,205
Run over <i>m y</i> neck perfectly.

754
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:55,241
But my face must remain handsome.
My condolence tour must be grand.

755
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:59,209
But please ensure my friend Janaki
is responsible for my death comes on TV 9.

756
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:02,816
I've Rs.2000 in my pocket, take Rs.1000
and pay balance to Jai, I owe him.

757
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,544
If not I may be born as gay
in my next life.

758
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:06,813
Get up.

759
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:13,828
What happened?
- She ruined my love.

760
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,232
My friend Chitra is here.

761
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:19,400
ls she coming?

762
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,467
Boss, rock it now.

763
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,001
ls he that Thota Hamudu?

764
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:25,871
Does your face need love?

765
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:27,965
Yes. Why'?

766
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:30,642
<i>Why are you slamm wring’!?</i>

767
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:35,783
On seeing you I'm little nervous
and stammering. That's all.

768
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:38,920
If you stammer for talking
to her for 5 minutes,

769
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,654
I think you may go dumb
if you've to talk to her all your life.

770
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,256
Would I?

771
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:44,585
Listen to me, drop out.

772
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:48,423
You're trying to torture us psychologically
and break us up.

773
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,293
This is not right.
Please unite us.

774
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:54,332
It seems your friend talked
about love yesterday.

775
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:55,526
Tell me, what that is?

776
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,271
Love me as much as you love, love.

777
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,032
Tell her to love me.

778
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,803
I'll love and love her more than love...

779
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,843
I'll love and unite with love.

780
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:05,775
Where did I go wrong?

781
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:06,607
I said love thrice.

782
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,442
Tell her to love me then.

783
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,343
Did you react so much for this?

784
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:13,521
He said it so well, you know?

785
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,747
Buddy, they're bashing me up here.
Are you there?

786
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:16,549
Hey, come here.

787
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:17,685
No!

788
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:18,689
Talk to us now.

789
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:19,451
I'm dead meat.

790
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,687
Show me how would you
propose love to her?

791
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,364
I'll present a flower and express.

792
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,826
That's why I'm ready with it.

793
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,468
Show variety!

794
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,298
Giving with hand is routine,
may be giving with mouth is variety.

795
00:55:31,595 --> 00:55:32,073
Slapped me again .

796
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,965
He fool of fools.

797
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,471
You're hurting me too much.
Another test please.

798
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,476
I'll win for sure.

799
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,342
What are you planning to do after love?

800
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,380
What others do, for <i>3</i> or 4 years...

801
00:55:42,573 --> 00:55:43,643
You want to enjoy and ditch her?

802
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,582
That's not in family line.
What are you saying?

803
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:47,847
What's your plan then?

804
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:50,321
Will you touch her physically
if you love her?

805
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,322
Can't avoid it, right?

806
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,324
Will you kiss her?

807
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,758
Will you boats before your friends
that she's your lover?

808
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,661
Tell me, what's do you want to do?

809
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:01,660
You're taking revenge on me, I got you.

810
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,395
You're ruining my love.

811
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:05,005
Okay, don't cry.

812
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,864
I'll give you Rs.10000.

813
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:11,774
Go to my college naked,
pay my fee and get the receipt.

814
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,347
What? You want me to pay fee naked?

815
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:18,111
Should I pay electricity and
phone bill too?

816
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,921
We wear clothes and take bath!

817
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,113
Will you dishonour me in public to pay fee?

818
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,754
Yes.

819
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:29,863
In the film 'Boys' Siddhartha runs
naked on road for his love.

820
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,091
Can't you at least pay college fee?
- I'll not.

821
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:35,903
If your love is sincere,
undress and go immediately.

822
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:36,901
Or else agree you're a flirt.

823
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:39,404
No man in this world will accept this.

824
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,473
That too naked...

825
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:43,736
You wantonly ruined my love, right?

826
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,072
Watch out, I'll die.

827
00:56:45,436 --> 00:56:47,712
Janaki, I'll die and
hover around you as ghost

828
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:54,781
Though you united us,
her sadist friend said I'm flirt,

829
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,889
and separated us.

830
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:57,888
She'll get ruined.

831
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:01,063
Will she create such a drama
if I'm late by 30 minutes?

832
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:03,056
Call Janaki on phone, I'll talk to her.

833
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:06,090
No, she'll ruin our friendship too.

834
00:57:06,457 --> 00:57:08,937
You don't know about her.
- Don't worry, I'll fix her.

835
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,628
They wear short skirts, are they not flirts?

836
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:12,398
ls this her number?
- Yes.

837
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:16,476
To hell with flirt!
I'll not accept.

838
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:18,012
Shirish is calling.

839
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:19,806
Give it to me, I'll talk to him.

840
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,079
Why did you call again?

841
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,680
If you call again, I'll kill you.

842
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:26,852
Janaki hates you.

843
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,181
This voice appears familiar!

844
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:32,653
If you call again, I'll call police.
Cut the call.

845
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,558
Who are you to say that?
- I'm Janaki's friend.

846
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,425
If I say anything, it's her words too.

847
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,761
Janaki's friend?
Don't you've a name?

848
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:44,939
Ch itra?

849
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,039
Yes, so what?

850
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,440
No girl would love a rogue like you.

851
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:51,644
Hey you silly girl!

852
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,041
That's my philosophy!

853
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:54,614
I'll hit you with slipper.

854
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:59,483
Girls are born for boys only.

855
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:00,984
I'll not let any girl fall for you.

856
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:03,180
Do whatsoever you can do!
Hey rogue!

857
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:05,618
If you call my friends again,
I'll kill you.

858
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:06,826
You played with my life,

859
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:10,726
if I don't kill you my name
henceforth shall not be Sidhu.

860
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:13,857
What happened?

861
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:15,900
Did she break our friendship too?
I told you.

862
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:18,130
If she talks, we'll go silent.

863
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,906
Where can I find Chitra?

864
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:27,207
HeyJanaki! Where's Chitra?

865
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,134
Just now she went to the parking lot.

866
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:37,903
Ch itra?

867
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,785
No girl would love a rogue like you.

868
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:59,890
I'll hit you with slipper!

869
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:07,399
Get lost!
Do whatsoever you can do!

870
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:08,737
The girl whom you thought was devil,
you loved the same girl as angel.

871
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:09,767
Yes, Father.

872
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,703
I fell in love with Chitra at first sight.

873
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:21,308
Look son, listen to me,
love her with heart and soul.

874
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:23,984
You'll always be blessed by Jesus.

875
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:26,450
I'll also pray for you.

876
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:46,063
My heart is flying towards you...

877
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:50,973
Your thoughts are pulling me
like magnet...

878
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:56,014
I feel like air has run out of oxygen...

879
01:02:56,206 --> 01:03:02,088
Your fragrance is taking over me...

880
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:10,460
I'm sending my pain to you...

881
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:20,097
Are the directions welcoming you
becoming my hands?

882
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:54,697
You went ferociously with sickle
threatening to kill her,

883
01:03:54,698 --> 01:03:59,340
You went ferociously with sickle
threatening to kill her,

884
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:01,015
how come you're having
tea leisurely here?

885
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:03,081
I told you, right?
You can't do anything to her.

886
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:04,149
That's it.

887
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,417
Come here.

888
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:07,916
Shall I tell you shocking news?
- Tell me.

889
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:11,888
The girl who broke your love and
crushed my college crush...

890
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:15,256
...is none other than the girl
I love so dearly. my Myna.

891
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:21,433
The namewhich makes your hair burn!

892
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:24,367
When she picks your call,
you don't talk anything other than bad words.

893
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:26,370
ls that girl your lover?

894
01:04:26,563 --> 01:04:29,203
Oh Allah!

895
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:30,969
This is against nature, leave it.

896
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:34,546
Why did you offer prayers in temple
and church?

897
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:37,909
If God in temple made me
love my enemy,

898
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:40,110
Jesus in church gave me clarity.

899
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:43,023
That she's my soul mate!
- Not shoe lace!

900
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,523
I don't know if you know
about her or not.

901
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,920
If any friend of her loves a boy,
she pounces on them like cheetah.

902
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,928
Would she see you?
Would she love you?

903
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:54,261
Just propose to her, you're finished.

904
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:59,202
I saw her with my eyes,
those tortures, tests and question.

905
01:04:59,396 --> 01:04:59,999
Stay away from her, buddy.

906
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:04,440
God has decided we're made
for each other lovers.

907
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:05,874
You keep quiet.

908
01:05:06,036 --> 01:05:10,348
My next target is to love her and
make her love me.

909
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:14,215
I'll follow her from tomorrow and
make her fall in love with me.

910
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,550
I'll also come, let me see!

911
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:27,965
How could you abuse such
a beautiful girl, you fool!

912
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,168
In that rack, madam.

913
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,914
Ifthere are two, why would she ask me?
I'll throw out this.

914
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,932
I feel like I've seen him somewhere...

915
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:20,317
Are you buying this CD?
- Yes.

916
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,956
I've been searching this CD
for 2 months now.

917
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:24,454
I'm not getting it anywhere.

918
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:28,460
If you don't buy this CD, I'll take it.

919
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:31,132
I was also searching this CD
for <i>3</i> months.

920
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,595
Luckily I got it today.

921
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:38,639
If I give it now, you may mistake me
for giving it to a girl.

922
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,475
I'll not think bad about you.

923
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,166
Please don't go overboard.

924
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,342
Give it.

925
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:56,547
If Chitra leaves with the CD,
what would you get, you fool?

926
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,987
Do something and stop her.

927
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:07,191
Can I hear the music of this CD
in the music room?

928
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:18,442
Didn't even imagine in my dream
you'd stand next to me so easily?

929
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:40,160
Entire cam pus is stinking of
my love failure.

930
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:43,803
If I fail in love and look like this,
my character's sincerity will be hurt.

931
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,468
I'll go away, please.

932
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:49,704
This role of Sri Rama will
not suit you, come.

933
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,704
Whyis he here?

934
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,411
Come, lefs go.

935
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,177
Anaconda! That dangerous snake!

936
01:07:58,375 --> 01:07:59,479
She'll swallow us alive!

937
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:01,553
Let her com e.
I love snakes.

938
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,815
I saw film 'Devi' 15 times, you know that?

939
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:05,792
You are...?

940
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:09,588
This college?

941
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:11,823
Never seen you in this college.

942
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,395
Even if you had seen
we don't know each other, right?

943
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,127
To recognize.

944
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,437
How do you know him?

945
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:25,735
I tried my best to save his love.
Just now he told you cut it.

946
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:26,807
Fool!

947
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,343
ls it you who told about love to Janaki?

948
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:31,652
You could've told her.

949
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,411
I'll think about your love, brother.

950
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,612
Sister, think seriously.
I'm very sincere.

951
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:38,418
Did you play that CD?

952
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:40,522
Did you likeit?
- Very much.

953
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:43,129
If you give me the CD,
I'll copy and return it.

954
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,424
I'll get you the CD tomorrow.

955
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:48,596
Ifs time to go to my class, I'll go now.

956
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:54,867
Which CD did you give her?
She has melted like ice cream.

957
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:58,644
That's the wonder of soul mate magic!
No philosophy can work on it.

958
01:08:58,835 --> 01:08:59,609
Watch now!

959
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,111
Hi!

960
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:04,617
Did you bring Raja sir?

961
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:05,548
Take it.

962
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:11,182
When I hear llayaraids tunes,
I feel he has a positive feeling on love.

963
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:13,258
Though so many have com posed
love songs,

964
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:17,124
llayaraids love songs are melodious
and heart touching, right?

965
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:22,235
May be he's a lover in real life!
- May be so!

966
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:26,673
If you observe, you'll see only
lovers reach the top position.

967
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:30,242
Because if you love,
all your hormones activate,

968
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:31,707
and your brain will become
very sharp,

969
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:34,541
just now I read it in this
psychology book

970
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:35,807
What do you say?

971
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:39,483
I don't have good opinion on love.

972
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:43,146
I mean won't you ever fall
in love with anyone?

973
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,393
First time I saw you offering
prayers in temple

974
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:51,497
I thought would there be such
traditional boys?

975
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,859
Later on I liked your attitude
and befriended you.

976
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:57,603
ls that why she's moving
so close with me?

977
01:09:57,894 --> 01:10:03,503
Please don't increase the distance
between us by talking about love, okay?

978
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:15,185
There's no love...don't love...

979
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:22,858
You're the witness...

980
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,722
Though the song is old,
you played it at right moment.

981
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:26,593
Great!

982
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:29,293
At least now good sense will prevail
over him and take a step back.

983
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,230
No...
- What no?

984
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:32,633
Soul mate is humbug.

985
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:34,604
Chitra hates love.

986
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:37,869
They would've told in the
language of psychology.

987
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,872
Be happy that she told you
that very softly.

988
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,477
That girl is basically very strong.

989
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:46,878
You and your damn English.

990
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:51,419
If Chitra has to love Sri Ram,
I must deal her in reverse.

991
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,390
Then, she'll hack you in reverse.

992
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,558
Watch it!

993
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,601
What? If any boys wears torn jeans,
he's a flirt,

994
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:06,569
if he sports spikes, he's a flirt,

995
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,606
you used your silly psychology
to make everyone psycho here,

996
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:14,248
are you listening music happily
with a real flirt?

997
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,447
Fall...you'll fall in love!

998
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,915
Useless bugger.
Who are you?

999
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,583
I'm Sidhu!

1000
01:11:20,844 --> 01:11:25,793
You broke my love twice, branded me
as flirt and played havoc with my life.

1001
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:27,256
Have you forgotten it?

1002
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,028
Why did you call me, useless fellow?

1003
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:35,869
Don't get BP unnecessarily.

1004
01:11:36,059 --> 01:11:38,630
Unable to see you with that real flirt,

1005
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:42,002
to give you friendly advice,
I called you...

1006
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:46,274
Are you listening?

1007
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:47,344
Tell me.

1008
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:49,642
By the what's his name?

1009
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:54,015
I know psychology of such boys.

1010
01:11:54,377 --> 01:11:55,788
They dress up neatly,

1011
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:58,959
since you love llayaraia songs,
he'll claim he too loves it,

1012
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,296
he'll match his tastes with yours
and make you fall for him.

1013
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:04,761
You're friendly with him
without knowing this.

1014
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:09,300
I'm sure he's a flirt who will
make you fall in love.

1015
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,301
If you've doubt, put him to flirt tests.

1016
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,974
Call him on phone and
find out if he's a flirt.

1017
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:23,980
Among all the boys I've seen
I thought Sri Ham is the best.

1018
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:26,982
But if he himself is a flirt...

1019
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,389
I can't believe it.

1020
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:44,699
Are you busy?
- No.

1021
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:49,036
Can I meet you tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

1022
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:05,084
You called me urgently,
want to tell me anything?

1023
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:09,123
Nothing, next week is my parents
wedding anniversary.

1024
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:12,557
I thought you could help me
in selecting dresses.

1025
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:17,733
Your dress selection will prove
whether you're a flirt or not.

1026
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:21,036
You said something.
- No.

1027
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:22,774
I felt like that.

1028
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,980
Your behaviour is different today.
- Oh no, nothing like that.

1029
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:34,552
Geetha and Sowm ya!

1030
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:35,984
If they see me,
it's curtains down for me!

1031
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:37,954
Chitra, come let's go downstairs.
Clothes are fine there.

1032
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,787
Why?
- First select for aunt. Come...

1033
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:46,397
Take it.

1034
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:47,829
How is it?

1035
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:50,967
This one?

1036
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:53,005
Super...very nice.

1037
01:13:58,034 --> 01:14:00,514
If they see me, I'm dead meat.

1038
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:04,917
Saris are not good here,
shall we see formals there?

1039
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:08,921
It'll be fine on uncle.
Come...come...

1040
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:12,586
Why are you looking here and there?

1041
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,153
If they're here!

1042
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:15,961
They? Who are they?

1043
01:14:17,987 --> 01:14:19,432
To know my size.

1044
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,493
Why your size?

1045
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:24,433
May be my size would suit uncle.

1046
01:14:31,234 --> 01:14:33,612
This is very short.

1047
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:35,879
Com e.

1048
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:47,624
You?

1049
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:48,994
Why did you fall on me?

1050
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:51,529
Not fell on you, I fell, that's all.

1051
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:07,242
No phone or message from you.
Have you forgotten us?

1052
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:08,911
Nothing like that.

1053
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:10,982
Shopping? Let's shop together.

1054
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:13,620
No, I need to go urgently.
I've work.

1055
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,221
Shall we meet on Sunday?

1056
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,024
Thank God!

1057
01:15:22,218 --> 01:15:24,095
Isn't she behaving differently?

1058
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:26,089
Let me go.

1059
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:35,173
Will you tempt me and walk out?

1060
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,943
If you stay for 10 minutes,
both of us can go out?

1061
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:47,521
Whether it is swing or cradle,
let me with you...

1062
01:15:50,613 --> 01:15:52,115
Let's go away from here immediately.

1063
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,691
Why did you pull me out from there?

1064
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,795
My close friends were there.

1065
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:08,235
While in Inter class,
I broke their love with a boy.

1066
01:16:08,598 --> 01:16:09,303
I don't know that.

1067
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:13,807
If they see me with you,
it would be embarrassing...

1068
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:16,108
Anyway what's wrong if anyone
falls in love?

1069
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:20,549
Loving someone isn't wrong but
loving a flirt like Sidhu is wrong.

1070
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,955
Who this Sidhu is?

1071
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:26,719
He's the flirt who loved my close friends.

1072
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:31,558
Boys who cheat girls with lies and play
with them must be poisoned to death.

1073
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,097
Think of him and I've started
using bad words.

1074
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:37,099
No bad words please,
when shall we go to shop again?

1075
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:41,901
I'm upset thinking about Sidhu.
No need to shop anymore.

1076
01:16:51,007 --> 01:16:53,681
You're worse than Dawood.

1077
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:56,189
Why did you create Sri Ram's character?

1078
01:16:56,379 --> 01:17:00,259
I told you to love her sincerely,
will you play drama with Sri Ham characier?

1079
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:06,294
I thought if I do like that Chitra may like
and fall in love with me.

1080
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:09,136
But it was proved to be
impossible with Chitra.

1081
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,601
That's curtains down for
my love story, Father.

1082
01:17:11,761 --> 01:17:14,207
Why did you love her if you
were so hopeless guy?

1083
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:17,970
Love means how patient one must be,
how many difficulties one must face!

1084
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,771
Will you take a back step
for two failures?

1085
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:20,970
What sort of a lover are you?

1086
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,116
Do you consider girls as
fast food counters?

1087
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,307
To get your food in plate on your order.

1088
01:17:25,675 --> 01:17:29,316
Tomorrow is friendship day,
give her a good gift and impress her.

1089
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:32,918
Wait patiently till Chitra falls
in love with you on her own.

1090
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,788
Do you say like that, Father?- That's all.

1091
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:38,124
Don't ever bring Sidhu into Chitra's life.

1092
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,959
Don't come to the church again.

1093
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,364
Isn't that frame good?

1094
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:50,005
Do you think she'll fall for gifts?

1095
01:17:52,368 --> 01:17:54,746
You're going trusting Father,
be careful of pitfalls.

1096
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:57,884
Chitra thinks Sri Ham is perfect.

1097
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,848
What if Sri Ram himself gives her a gift?

1098
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,147
You think Chitra will turn towards you.

1099
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:08,191
Where are the wedding gifts?

1100
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:10,386
ls it your wedding?
- Your grandma's.

1101
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,992
Would I buy a gift for my wedding?
- You're right.

1102
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,065
There.

1103
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:16,166
Can't you tell that first?

1104
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,105
Can you please keep this photo
in this frame and pack it?

1105
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,410
Chitra's photo!

1106
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:36,022
Who gave it to you?
- That boy gave it.

1107
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:57,806
What's your connection with Chitra?

1108
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,477
Why are you buying a frame
for Chitra's photo?

1109
01:19:00,837 --> 01:19:03,477
Did you both put us in loop line
and hit main line?

1110
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:04,408
'If Ifait a minute!

1111
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:07,482
She says she hates live,
why is she doing this?

1112
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:28,842
What happened to Sidhu?

1113
01:19:29,465 --> 01:19:30,273
By the way, who are you?

1114
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:32,173
I'm Sidhu's ex-girl friend.

1115
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,109
ls that why you're acting
like Kamalahasan?

1116
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:36,283
How Sidhu and Chitra are connected?

1117
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:38,748
There's nothing between Sidhu and Chitra.

1118
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:42,115
You and Chitra played football with his life.

1119
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,489
He lost his balance.

1120
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,922
He lost interest in life,
he has become mad.

1121
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,860
Like Bharath in the film 'Premisthey'.

1122
01:19:52,188 --> 01:19:53,963
I think he remembered the
flashback on seeing you.

1123
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:56,932
That's why he's jumping and shouting!

1124
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:59,128
Don't know what would happen to him?
- But why Chitra's photo?

1125
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:02,366
He won't eat food unless
this photo is hit with stones.

1126
01:20:02,565 --> 01:20:06,843
That's whyl put it in frame
and hit it with stones.

1127
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:07,946
Can I believe it?

1128
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:11,812
He's jumping and shouting here,
if you want take him to you house for few days.

1129
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:12,985
You can see how he'll hit the photo.

1130
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:14,779
No, you can't bear to see it.

1131
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:18,982
He's a flirt for wearing shirt
and pant, flirt...flirt...

1132
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,787
He's indeed flirt, wait, I'm coming.

1133
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:22,996
You mustn't hit it.

1134
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:25,222
I'm bringing the photo, hit it.

1135
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:26,900
Go away, he may hit you also.

1136
01:20:27,089 --> 01:20:30,798
Come...com e...dear...dear...

1137
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:33,303
Don't hit loversmlovers are flowers.

1138
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:55,827
You came here on my call,
thank you very much.

1139
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:02,024
Why are you so dull?

1140
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:03,828
Sidhu has gone mad.

1141
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,302
Has Sidhu gone mad?
- Yes.

1142
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:09,498
Have you posted the matter already?

1143
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,937
It seems his ex-girl friend Geetha saw him.

1144
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:15,343
Forget it, it's his fate.

1145
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,108
How can we leave him?

1146
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:20,344
One who talked to me 2 days ago,
if he goes mad suddenly,

1147
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,146
how can I believe it?

1148
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:24,184
I must meet Sidhu immediately.

1149
01:21:25,147 --> 01:21:26,455
I must talk to him.

1150
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,496
Who are you calling now?

1151
01:21:41,163 --> 01:21:42,039
Please go out.

1152
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:51,880
Isn't this Sidhu's number?

1153
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:54,987
This is my number,
he steals my cell and uses it.

1154
01:21:55,177 --> 01:21:57,418
Who are you?

1155
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,558
How do you know my name?

1156
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:08,425
You made a man turn mad saying flirt,
can't I know your name?

1157
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,166
We send him out four times aweek,

1158
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:16,332
we came to know he was
calling and torturing you,

1159
01:22:16,699 --> 01:22:19,202
that's why we tied him
with chains today.

1160
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:22,548
He'll never enter your life again.

1161
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,680
Doctor, he talks to me intelligently.

1162
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:29,420
Shouldn't mad people talk intelligently?

1163
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:33,253
Come to my hospital, I'll show you
how intelligent mad people are!

1164
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,690
By the way, where is he?

1165
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:42,535
Forget this matter here.
Remove Sidhu from your mind.

1166
01:22:58,274 --> 01:22:59,218
Have coffee.

1167
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:04,556
Shall we go to mental hospital?

1168
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:07,491
Mental hospital?
Why?

1169
01:23:07,683 --> 01:23:09,458
I must see Sidhu immediately.

1170
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:13,224
You know Sidhu has gone mad,
why see him?

1171
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:16,629
I'm very sad because I'm responsible
for his condition.

1172
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,632
I want to see Sidhu now.
Please, let's go.

1173
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,406
Please come for my sake.

1174
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:24,237
Don't know in what condition he's now in?

1175
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:26,140
Okay, I'll go alone.

1176
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,144
She may go even if I say no.

1177
01:23:31,574 --> 01:23:34,987
Give me a night, come tomorrow at 10 am
to Erragadda mental hospital.

1178
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:36,986
I'll wait for you there.

1179
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,384
Will you come?

1180
01:23:39,615 --> 01:23:40,559
Can I dare not come?

1181
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:41,727
You go now.

1182
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:43,162
I'll come.

1183
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:52,267
Where's your love story heading?

1184
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:56,172
I need urgently a mad Sidhu!

1185
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:56,397
For the cloud that went away
from sky...

1186
01:23:56,398 --> 01:24:01,347
For the cloud that went away
from sky...

1187
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,676
The sky left to bring it back...

1188
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:08,510
To abroad...

1189
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:14,024
For the water drop that fell
from the peak of a mount...

1190
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:18,187
It has left it's hometo go into exile...

1191
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:37,410
ls he hero or villain?

1192
01:24:37,606 --> 01:24:39,085
He's strong and touch like iron...

1193
01:24:39,275 --> 01:24:42,051
He's swift like lightning and
devastating like thunder...

1194
01:24:42,278 --> 01:24:47,057
He's protector or destroyer
or testing time to test itself...

1195
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:51,060
Inhale breath!

1196
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,162
Exhale!

1197
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:53,832
I think you've problem.

1198
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:59,433
I can scan your body with my eyes
and tell your horoscope.

1199
01:24:59,628 --> 01:25:00,402
ls it?

1200
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:01,740
What's your name?

1201
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:03,673
Your name?

1202
01:25:05,868 --> 01:25:08,246
What do you want?
- Doctor, we need...

1203
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:11,680
Hey, I got it on seeing you.
You want a mad man, right?

1204
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:12,778
How?

1205
01:25:13,142 --> 01:25:14,587
I'm telling you again.

1206
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:16,748
What type of madm an you want?

1207
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,750
You want money mad or
cinema mad man.

1208
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:19,819
Or you want a man mad about girls.

1209
01:25:20,182 --> 01:25:22,822
I want a mad man who can scare girls.

1210
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:24,856
It seems body is ready.

1211
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:27,693
But there's a small risk with him.

1212
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:28,664
Nothing will happen to you, doctor.

1213
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:30,700
The risk is not mine but yours.

1214
01:25:30,893 --> 01:25:32,702
He'll become a demon on seeing girls.

1215
01:25:32,895 --> 01:25:37,605
Nobody can control him not even your
ancestors, are you ready for him?

1216
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,610
Doctor, we want only him.

1217
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,814
Where's the train heading to?
Pungunur or Paris?

1218
01:25:48,177 --> 01:25:50,123
Who are you calling?
- Wait.

1219
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:54,350
Good news for you.
We're now with Sidhu.

1220
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,790
Sidhu? Really?

1221
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,495
Come immediately to Erragadda hospital.

1222
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:01,631
Don't talk now.

1223
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:03,132
Looks like you called someone.

1224
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:06,665
Chitra, his girl friend.

1225
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:07,739
Chitra, right?

1226
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,741
Chitra means girl, right?

1227
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,777
Girl friend means girl, right doctor?

1228
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:15,543
You foolish idiot!

1229
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:17,810
Why did you hit him like that, doctor?

1230
01:26:19,408 --> 01:26:20,819
I mustn't hit him like that, right?

1231
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:24,849
What happened, doctor?

1232
01:26:25,214 --> 01:26:29,890
we men were happily discussing here,
how dare you make a call to a girl?

1233
01:26:30,252 --> 01:26:35,326
You dog! I'll kill you.
I want you head!

1234
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,901
What are you doing here?

1235
01:26:39,461 --> 01:26:42,670
How many times I've told you not
use my shoes, coat and steth?

1236
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:45,345
If anyone sees me,
they'll think I'm mad.

1237
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:48,214
If you do this again,
I'll give you shock treatment.

1238
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:49,473
No need, doctor.

1239
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:53,175
Shock treatment to doctor?
- Doctor?

1240
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,685
I'm Drﬁaiini.
- You?

1241
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:58,858
Then, he?
- Patient Ghaiini.

1242
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:01,251
Remove that dress.

1243
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:03,396
Okay, doctor, I'll do as you say.
- Remove it.

1244
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:05,258
Enough of your acting, remove it.

1245
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:06,558
Hem ove the pant.

1246
01:27:06,755 --> 01:27:08,257
I'm undressing.

1247
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:17,474
Off all the organs,
bell ringing is most important.

1248
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:22,210
ls he mad man?
- Very severe.

1249
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:23,883
He's a demon for girls.

1250
01:27:27,276 --> 01:27:30,382
They talked to a girl named Chitra
before me, doctor,.

1251
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:31,922
If you give me 5 minutes, I'll kill him.

1252
01:27:32,281 --> 01:27:33,225
Both of them?

1253
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:37,623
This guy is a lizard.
How dare you talk to a girl!

1254
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,595
I'll kill you.
- Come here.

1255
01:27:40,489 --> 01:27:41,900
Will you listen to me?
- I'll listen you, doctor.

1256
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,395
Actual matter is,

1257
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:45,003
men get ruined because of wom en,

1258
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,771
and he's making a phone call
to a woman,

1259
01:27:46,962 --> 01:27:49,909
why should I listen to you?
I'll not.

1260
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,745
Hey you, I'll kill if you talk to woman.

1261
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:53,606
Stop th ere!

1262
01:27:53,802 --> 01:27:58,251
If you talk to woman, you'll get ruined.

1263
01:28:03,812 --> 01:28:05,985
Why are you running away?
- That mad man is after us.

1264
01:28:06,348 --> 01:28:07,588
Mad man?

1265
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:12,865
Look, how he has become!

1266
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,361
Sister!

1267
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:30,048
Where are you going?
- Sister, I'll go to loo.

1268
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:31,475
Will you come back?

1269
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:34,711
Yes, sister.
Would you like to have another round?

1270
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,449
Have you come back, sister?

1271
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:39,387
Did you go out for summer holidays?

1272
01:28:39,581 --> 01:28:43,028
Sister is back for another round.

1273
01:28:45,521 --> 01:28:46,727
Why did he get scared on
seeing the girl?

1274
01:28:46,922 --> 01:28:51,632
I'm living peacefully in menial hospital,
will you come here also for my life?

1275
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:52,567
I'll not get caught easily.

1276
01:28:52,761 --> 01:28:54,069
Please listen to me, come down.

1277
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:58,969
Sister, I'll wet my pants on seeing you,
I can't do it anymore.

1278
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,745
Please come down.
- Please leave me.

1279
01:29:00,936 --> 01:29:01,880
Why is he behaving like this?

1280
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,378
Sidhu has become like this
because of me.

1281
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,311
Take away the girl from here,
he's just a kid. He's scared.

1282
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,320
ls he a kid? He's old hag.

1283
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:14,687
Look at him! Come, let's go away.

1284
01:29:14,883 --> 01:29:18,387
O Lord! It seems she's possessed
by ghost as well as gone mad.

1285
01:29:18,587 --> 01:29:21,329
Why is she calling me Sidhu?
God, you must save me.

1286
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:29,837
Why is she sitting here only?

1287
01:29:37,806 --> 01:29:40,412
Whatever fate decides,
people have to face it.

1288
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:41,610
Sidhu too!

1289
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:42,787
His fate!

1290
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:45,356
He must go through this all his life.

1291
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,424
Come, let's go home and study.

1292
01:29:47,616 --> 01:29:50,790
What's this, Sri Ham?
He has become mad because of me.

1293
01:29:50,986 --> 01:29:52,795
How can you be so insensitive?

1294
01:29:54,456 --> 01:29:56,436
I didn't expect such words from you.

1295
01:29:56,625 --> 01:30:01,574
Do you want us to take him home
and look after him well?

1296
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,535
That's right!
- Gone!

1297
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:08,776
If he lives among so many mad people,
he can never get well.

1298
01:30:08,971 --> 01:30:12,418
Unless he lives among normal people like us,
he can't get better and become normal.

1299
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,916
No, there are good doctors here.

1300
01:30:14,109 --> 01:30:15,747
Mad man in house will be
very difficult, no please.

1301
01:30:15,944 --> 01:30:17,150
I can't.

1302
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:26,798
Can you keep Sidhu with you for few days?

1303
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:29,735
For my sake.

1304
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:31,896
Why do you request me?

1305
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:37,008
It's my responsibility to make
Sidhu normal man again.

1306
01:30:41,603 --> 01:30:42,809
You can go now.

1307
01:30:46,475 --> 01:30:49,081
Remorseless mouth! Slap me!

1308
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:53,085
The hand she left now,
if she has to hold it for life,

1309
01:30:53,749 --> 01:30:55,422
I must take him to my home.

1310
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,761
I can't leave any opportunity
to get closer to Chitra.

1311
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:04,767
If I look after him well,
it means my love is success.

1312
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,930
Com e, let's ask doctor and
take him home.

1313
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:09,973
Com e.

1314
01:31:17,506 --> 01:31:20,043
I'm a pearl among men!
- Come and sit inside.

1315
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:25,117
We're taking this mad man to room,
how will you manage him?

1316
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,482
I can't see Chiira feeling sad.

1317
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:29,821
Not only you, she loves many other men.

1318
01:31:30,018 --> 01:31:31,053
Get her off the bike, you innocent man.

1319
01:31:31,253 --> 01:31:32,129
What bothers you if I go out
with my lover?

1320
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,467
How dare you talk to me!

1321
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:35,600
He'll get us lynched!

1322
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:37,463
Yesterday I ditched Fiajesh.

1323
01:31:37,793 --> 01:31:39,568
Why are you roaming on roads
without clothes?

1324
01:31:39,761 --> 01:31:41,536
My wish, who are you to ask us?

1325
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:43,641
How dare you answer the
diamond among men!

1326
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:46,573
Hey you, stopmsiop...
Stop there, you Panchali!

1327
01:31:46,768 --> 01:31:49,681
You left hair down and clothes too!

1328
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:50,645
You gave up traditions!

1329
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:53,547
You must be wearing this in bathroom,
are you wearing it in public?

1330
01:31:53,742 --> 01:31:56,848
Because of women like you
Indian men are getting ruined.

1331
01:31:57,045 --> 01:31:57,989
Bloody face!

1332
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:01,649
I'll not let such dirty Western culture
influence India!

1333
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,989
Men will prosper only if women go extinct

1334
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,823
I'm a pearl among men!

1335
01:32:07,756 --> 01:32:09,702
I beg you, please don't create trouble.

1336
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:13,168
If anyone in this apartment complex sees you,
all three of us would get thrown out.

1337
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,099
Look at that uncle!

1338
01:32:17,099 --> 01:32:21,878
If you behave well like him, I'll buy you
doctor dress you wore today morning.

1339
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:24,245
Watch my performance now.

1340
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,024
Uncle, phone call for you.

1341
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:37,729
Hi dear! Are you studying well, dear?

1342
01:32:39,755 --> 01:32:41,029
Are you eating on time?

1343
01:32:43,258 --> 01:32:45,602
Which ice cream should I bring
for you today evening, Baby?

1344
01:32:45,794 --> 01:32:46,534
Baby?

1345
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,139
Vanilla or chocobar?

1346
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:49,638
Okay, Baby?

1347
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:53,704
Looks like you talked to someone
on phone.

1348
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:55,882
I talked to baby.
- Baby?

1349
01:32:56,171 --> 01:32:57,309
It's baby, right?
- My baby.

1350
01:32:57,672 --> 01:32:59,879
Baby means girl, right?
- Yes, my daughter.

1351
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:05,717
I will die...die...
- Die...die...

1352
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:08,925
I'm dead.

1353
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:10,957
Enough of it, com e.

1354
01:33:11,853 --> 01:33:13,059
Don't push me.

1355
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:16,066
Close the door.
Lock it.

1356
01:33:17,192 --> 01:33:17,897
Tell me.

1357
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:19,936
Whom did you hit now?
President of this apartment complex.

1358
01:33:20,128 --> 01:33:20,936
You fool shut up!

1359
01:33:21,129 --> 01:33:24,235
If anyone talks to woman, whether apartment
president or America president,

1360
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:26,169
I'll bash him! Better know it.

1361
01:33:26,368 --> 01:33:29,076
"Fll now you saw mad man
biting others,

1362
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:31,217
now you'll see a mad man
getting bitten.

1363
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:33,916
I'm a pearl among men,
you mustn't hit me.

1364
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:36,089
If you step out of this room,
you're dead.

1365
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:38,918
You do it, I'll stand silently.

1366
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:50,262
Reduce the volume.
If he gets up, he'll bash you.

1367
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,036
Look at Katrina!

1368
01:34:00,268 --> 01:34:06,810
Hey you! I told you not to see,
hear or even think ofwoman!

1369
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:10,046
Sh eel a's youth?

1370
01:34:10,245 --> 01:34:12,987
Will you play awoman's song?

1371
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:18,261
If I don't dedicate your body
to the world of men...

1372
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:21,830
Change the channel...

1373
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:23,400
Will you change that song or not?

1374
01:34:23,758 --> 01:34:25,328
I'll stay here only, change it.

1375
01:34:25,694 --> 01:34:27,298
Change it...change it...

1376
01:34:28,897 --> 01:34:30,308
Look, she's calling me with that gesture.

1377
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:32,042
Change the channel.

1378
01:34:34,336 --> 01:34:36,646
Change the channel.

1379
01:34:39,074 --> 01:34:41,384
Will you change or not?

1380
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,852
ls it you, Guru?
Sorry, sir.

1381
01:34:47,048 --> 01:34:50,825
When in the mood of sex,
you lose all your senses.

1382
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:51,326
He's mad with desires.

1383
01:34:56,358 --> 01:34:58,338
<i>smpnslop...</i>

1384
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:01,435
You're roaming with desires,
you're dead today!

1385
01:35:01,997 --> 01:35:07,345
The plant tells you to grow silently...

1386
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:11,707
As you grow be humble,
that's the lesson it teaches us...

1387
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:13,681
ls it? Wait, I'm coming.

1388
01:35:16,278 --> 01:35:18,349
The place where you lose,
search victory there only...

1389
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,351
He's turning more humane.

1390
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:21,887
The plant never told me.

1391
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:25,360
The place where leaves wither,
new leaves sprout from there only...

1392
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:29,099
I don't get you, that's whyl say
women are tigers in sheep skin.

1393
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:33,068
I'll not grow silently,
I'll not let any woman to grow!

1394
01:35:39,301 --> 01:35:41,713
I'm a man!

1395
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:59,262
I'm as I was today morning.

1396
01:35:59,454 --> 01:36:02,492
I mean you took home a mad man...

1397
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:05,736
You took Sidhu to your home, right?

1398
01:36:05,927 --> 01:36:09,101
Did he trouble you?
- You found it right.

1399
01:36:09,297 --> 01:36:12,938
Did he make you cry'?
- No, he's making us laugh.

1400
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:18,243
No, you're lying.
I can understand your retort.

1401
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,748
It was all because of me.

1402
01:36:19,941 --> 01:36:23,912
No, Sidhu is not giving us any trouble.

1403
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:25,250
He's just a kid.

1404
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:28,256
We must take care of him, that's all.
- Thank you very much.

1405
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:31,431
You're suffering for my mistake.

1406
01:36:33,388 --> 01:36:35,425
No need of sorry between us.

1407
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:40,261
First I liked your decency.

1408
01:36:40,562 --> 01:36:43,941
I started liking you more
seeing your honesty.

1409
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:45,536
Now...

1410
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,140
Now?

1411
01:36:47,402 --> 01:36:49,507
Please tell me.
Tell me, please!

1412
01:36:51,506 --> 01:36:52,883
Nothing!

1413
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:56,147
Please don't call me formally.

1414
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:07,789
Sidhu! You've succeeded!

1415
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:33,317
It's happy all over now...
It's roller coaster ride all the way...

1416
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:37,019
Hereafter we both are lovers...

1417
01:37:37,218 --> 01:37:41,189
Heart meets heart and
it's crazy nuisance...

1418
01:37:41,389 --> 01:37:45,201
There's no reverse gear
for the vehicle of love...

1419
01:37:45,393 --> 01:37:48,966
I'm shining like Ta] in moonbeam...

1420
01:37:49,164 --> 01:37:53,078
I'm growing tall like Everest...

1421
01:37:53,268 --> 01:37:56,613
I'm glowing like the colours
of a rainbow...

1422
01:37:56,971 --> 01:38:00,612
O girl, I've hoisted the flag of love
because of you...

1423
01:38:40,615 --> 01:38:44,290
You've to say these words
today or someday...

1424
01:38:44,486 --> 01:38:48,263
Even if you refuse to say,
but I heard it...

1425
01:38:48,456 --> 01:38:52,268
Though I don't say but you're
my heart beat...

1426
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:56,306
What you wanted to hear,
I said it with my heart silently...

1427
01:38:56,497 --> 01:39:04,507
Though our hearts are united,
why this veil of distance between us?

1428
01:39:04,706 --> 01:39:12,557
Let's tell loudly to the world
what our hearts know...

1429
01:39:32,233 --> 01:39:34,144
Why did you allow them into our room?

1430
01:39:34,336 --> 01:39:35,940
Because they won't let us
into their room.

1431
01:39:36,137 --> 01:39:39,346
“My do you make the same
mistake again?

1432
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:43,317
I'm a pearl among men.

1433
01:39:43,511 --> 01:39:45,548
Stop it, go to your room!
Go to your room.

1434
01:39:46,214 --> 01:39:47,386
Can't manage that mad man anymore.

1435
01:39:47,582 --> 01:39:49,289
Let's take him back to
hospital tomorrow.

1436
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:51,691
Your love won't succeed with him.

1437
01:39:53,989 --> 01:39:57,664
Where did I come from to you?

1438
01:39:58,025 --> 01:40:01,700
From here I'll anywhere
but with you only...

1439
01:40:02,063 --> 01:40:05,636
From the birth I'm with you
as your shadow...

1440
01:40:06,001 --> 01:40:09,972
Whether I'm in your eyes or heart,
I'm your life...

1441
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:17,988
Our love got united in heaven,
I cameto know about it now...

1442
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:26,724
Shall we unite as earth and sky as love
without any limit of time and distance?

1443
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:04,533
Little happiness and little sorrows.

1444
01:41:04,726 --> 01:41:07,070
More than the happiness
that Chitra loves me,

1445
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:11,300
I'm more sad for cheating her
with a mad man act as Sidhu.

1446
01:41:11,499 --> 01:41:16,471
Please do some miracle,
remove that mad man between us,

1447
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:18,651
and ensure our love succeeds
in near future.

1448
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,342
Please, my lord!

1449
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:28,352
Who are you?
You look like an alien frog.

1450
01:41:28,549 --> 01:41:30,825
I'm maid servant.

1451
01:41:31,152 --> 01:41:33,598
Don't you know a woman
mustn't enter this house?

1452
01:41:33,788 --> 01:41:35,495
What will you do if I enter?

1453
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:38,170
What will you do?
- I'll show demo.

1454
01:41:42,697 --> 01:41:46,338
All of you come quickly!

1455
01:41:48,135 --> 01:41:52,174
All of you come quickly!

1456
01:41:53,341 --> 01:41:55,844
Goons?
- No, friends!

1457
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:58,247
Not friends but ghosts.

1458
01:41:58,446 --> 01:42:00,084
Give me, sister.

1459
01:42:13,828 --> 01:42:15,102
Give me way...
- Move!

1460
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:20,439
Who is that rogue?

1461
01:42:21,369 --> 01:42:24,145
Is he the man who hit you?
- Yes, madam.

1462
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:27,611
Hey you rogue!

1463
01:42:27,808 --> 01:42:29,310
How dare you hit maids?

1464
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:33,856
If we 50 round you up,
you'll die in that sound!

1465
01:42:34,215 --> 01:42:38,163
Not just one by one, send all
the devils at atime, you Ogre!

1466
01:42:38,353 --> 01:42:40,355
I'll finish them in one shot.

1467
01:42:40,555 --> 01:42:43,297
My Shakee
a's army!

1468
01:43:08,283 --> 01:43:09,159
Attack !

1469
01:43:24,866 --> 01:43:28,905
Don't confuse by rounding me up!
In confusion I'll hit with more clarity.

1470
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:31,682
Watch the show of this man's
gigantic form!

1471
01:43:43,818 --> 01:43:45,456
What a man!

1472
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:53,704
You're rocking, man!

1473
01:43:57,799 --> 01:43:59,472
Sorry brother, I didn't see it.

1474
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:02,407
Where did you hit me, sister?
VWII you hit me wherever you feel like?

1475
01:44:02,604 --> 01:44:06,416
Trying to kill a gem among men!
I'll break your head!

1476
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:21,858
That's mine!

1477
01:44:22,323 --> 01:44:23,768
49!

1478
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:26,302
It's 50 with you!

1479
01:44:26,794 --> 01:44:28,432
Will it happen?

1480
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:31,334
What's this?

1481
01:44:32,834 --> 01:44:33,608
Men are safe now.

1482
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:35,576
Men are safe?

1483
01:44:37,271 --> 01:44:38,511
Did you hit them all?

1484
01:44:39,674 --> 01:44:42,587
What happened?
- Asking us what happened?

1485
01:44:42,776 --> 01:44:45,279
This mad man thrashed us mercilessly.

1486
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:47,584
Why did you bring this animal here?

1487
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:49,420
Isn't it you who hit me in lift?

1488
01:44:52,487 --> 01:44:55,934
ls this mad man your guest?
- He's not mad man, he's my friend.

1489
01:44:56,557 --> 01:44:57,968
He can't stay here for a moment.

1490
01:44:58,359 --> 01:44:59,770
You go away from this apartment.

1491
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:00,938
Why are you asking us to go?

1492
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:02,000
Go to the room.

1493
01:45:02,363 --> 01:45:04,934
Go!
- I'll do as you say.

1494
01:45:05,466 --> 01:45:10,643
If you don't vacate the place by evening,
I'll complaint to police against you.

1495
01:45:10,838 --> 01:45:11,714
Got it?

1496
01:45:15,376 --> 01:45:18,289
Your nest is shattered...

1497
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:21,289
Your heart is battered...

1498
01:45:21,482 --> 01:45:23,655
O little dove...

1499
01:45:28,723 --> 01:45:30,896
Stop that song, I beg you.

1500
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:34,898
You said about some miracle,
is this that miracle?

1501
01:45:35,096 --> 01:45:36,404
Tell that mad man.

1502
01:45:36,597 --> 01:45:38,577
We're on road because of him,
explain it to him.

1503
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:40,501
Did you understand like this?

1504
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:42,044
You'll understand this clearly.

1505
01:45:42,403 --> 01:45:46,749
If anyone sees him fighting,
would he believe he's mad?

1506
01:45:52,747 --> 01:45:55,318
Enough of shaking! It's Chitra's phone.

1507
01:45:55,516 --> 01:45:57,325
Chitra! Silence please!

1508
01:45:57,518 --> 01:45:58,826
I'll cut your nose.

1509
01:46:01,756 --> 01:46:02,530
Where are you now?

1510
01:46:02,723 --> 01:46:07,502
Sidhu may feel suffocated in room,
so we're on road for cool air.

1511
01:46:07,695 --> 01:46:10,335
When a man was crying
seeing his house on fire,

1512
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:11,874
it seems a man like you
invited him to marriage then.

1513
01:46:12,066 --> 01:46:14,876
How's his behaviour now?
- How?

1514
01:46:15,069 --> 01:46:16,776
You'll get shocked if you see him.

1515
01:46:17,972 --> 01:46:23,046
He did single handedly what all the maids
do together and earned good name.

1516
01:46:23,411 --> 01:46:24,014
ls it?

1517
01:46:24,379 --> 01:46:27,883
Every aunt wanted him to
come to their home.

1518
01:46:28,082 --> 01:46:29,390
They troubled him a lot.

1519
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:32,120
We're on road now unable
to bear their affection.

1520
01:46:32,487 --> 01:46:34,524
Did you bring so much change
in just one day?

1521
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:36,360
Isn't it all for my sake?

1522
01:46:37,058 --> 01:46:37,900
Yes.

1523
01:46:38,092 --> 01:46:40,663
Come to Indira park tomorrow
morning with Sidhu.

1524
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:42,067
I've a surprise for you.

1525
01:46:42,429 --> 01:46:44,705
He'll become normal with that.

1526
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:49,707
Let's close Sidhu's chapter
and open our chapter.

1527
01:46:49,904 --> 01:46:52,384
Okay?
<i>'</i> Okay,

1528
01:46:54,008 --> 01:46:56,716
She wants to bring him to
Indira park tomorrow morning.

1529
01:46:56,944 --> 01:46:58,821
I'm quiet because he's mad
if not I'll punch him to death.

1530
01:46:59,013 --> 01:47:01,823
Not to Indira park, take him
o Jurasic park, he's a T-rex.

1531
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:05,896
You're lying as you like and
he's kicking me as he likes.

1532
01:47:06,087 --> 01:47:07,794
Both of you together kill me.

1533
01:47:07,988 --> 01:47:10,400
No, you don't know about Chitra.

1534
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:14,164
If we manage him perfectly tomorrow,
Chitra will tell I love you to me.

1535
01:47:14,528 --> 01:47:16,940
How can you still trust him?
Don't keep your faith in him.

1536
01:47:18,466 --> 01:47:19,740
Keep it.

1537
01:47:20,034 --> 01:47:21,172
What's your name, dear?

1538
01:47:21,536 --> 01:47:24,415
What's your name, dear?
- My name is Sri Ram.

1539
01:47:24,605 --> 01:47:26,414
My name is Sri Ram.

1540
01:47:26,807 --> 01:47:27,979
My nameis Sidhu.

1541
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:29,518
My name is also Sidhu.

1542
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:31,616
Fix on this.

1543
01:47:32,613 --> 01:47:34,115
My life is in your hands.

1544
01:47:34,481 --> 01:47:37,462
What will you do if you meet
the girl you saw in hospital?

1545
01:47:37,651 --> 01:47:41,098
She's a devil, Ogre, ghost...
you don't know.

1546
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:43,435
She'll hit me.
- She's not a ghost.

1547
01:47:43,624 --> 01:47:45,103
GoddessmGoddess...

1548
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,029
Get down.

1549
01:47:47,662 --> 01:47:48,640
Who is here?

1550
01:47:48,796 --> 01:47:50,434
who?

1551
01:47:50,731 --> 01:47:51,573
Goddess.
- Goddess.

1552
01:47:51,766 --> 01:47:53,109
What do you on seeing Goddess?
- What would we do?

1553
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:56,004
You must pray.
Pray!

1554
01:47:56,204 --> 01:47:59,777
The girl you saw in hospital is Goddess,
you must pray to her.

1555
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:02,614
No...no...she's ghost.
No, I'll not come...

1556
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:09,125
I'll not come...I'll not comemleave me...

1557
01:48:10,918 --> 01:48:11,828
I don't get you.

1558
01:48:12,019 --> 01:48:14,192
You entered my life though you're
not related to me in any way.

1559
01:48:14,555 --> 01:48:15,966
Now you're my God to make
my love succeed.

1560
01:48:16,157 --> 01:48:17,227
God?

1561
01:48:18,793 --> 01:48:20,204
I beg you.

1562
01:48:21,128 --> 01:48:25,577
Don't create any trouble on
seeing that girl.

1563
01:48:26,067 --> 01:48:29,480
If you want I'll fall at your feet.

1564
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:33,049
Buddy, I don't mind going to streets like this.

1565
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,811
But seeing you like this...
- I want Chitra.

1566
01:48:36,644 --> 01:48:37,918
I can't live without Chitra.

1567
01:48:38,112 --> 01:48:39,989
Okay, what should I do, friend?

1568
01:48:40,181 --> 01:48:43,025
Come neatly like us and behave normal.

1569
01:48:43,217 --> 01:48:46,027
You must be as we are.

1570
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:50,498
You mustn't hit anyone.
- Okay, I'll be as you are!

1571
01:49:15,716 --> 01:49:17,195
Sidhu is coming!

1572
01:49:19,953 --> 01:49:21,864
It seems he's fine now.

1573
01:49:22,656 --> 01:49:24,795
Your family is searching grooms for you, right?

1574
01:49:24,992 --> 01:49:28,804
If you like Sidhu...
You can marry him, right?

1575
01:49:28,996 --> 01:49:32,273
It would be like giving new life
to a mad man of love.

1576
01:49:34,601 --> 01:49:35,944
Sidhu going mad?

1577
01:49:36,137 --> 01:49:38,947
He never loved me so much to go mad.

1578
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:41,620
It was just attraction during
those teen years.

1579
01:49:41,809 --> 01:49:43,254
In fact I proposed love.

1580
01:49:43,611 --> 01:49:46,319
He didn't even care of see me
after break-up.

1581
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:49,820
How can he go mad now for
what happened years ago?

1582
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:52,996
No, he has really gone mad.

1583
01:49:53,187 --> 01:49:57,761
I saw him roaming like Bharath
of the film ‘Premisthey’.

1584
01:49:57,958 --> 01:49:59,232
He loves you madly.

1585
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:00,799
You must marry him.

1586
01:50:01,195 --> 01:50:02,731
He's right choice for your madness.

1587
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:06,737
Why have doubts?
Sidhu is with Sri Ham.

1588
01:50:06,934 --> 01:50:10,074
Who is Sri Ham?
- My boy friend.

1589
01:50:11,305 --> 01:50:12,909
After uniting you both,

1590
01:50:13,107 --> 01:50:15,246
I want to propose to Sri Ham,
so I've called him here.

1591
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,680
Do you've a boy friend?

1592
01:50:18,345 --> 01:50:22,259
You hated love and boyfriends,
he has made you fall in love,

1593
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:25,096
we must surely meet him.

1594
01:50:25,286 --> 01:50:26,856
Stop...stop...here only.

1595
01:50:27,921 --> 01:50:30,663
I'm gem of men and
diamond among men.

1596
01:50:41,035 --> 01:50:41,945
Here!

1597
01:50:42,269 --> 01:50:43,270
Ain't
 handsome?

1598
01:50:44,738 --> 01:50:46,012
Not me, you want him.

1599
01:50:46,207 --> 01:50:48,380
Why is Sri Ham so horrible?

1600
01:50:48,743 --> 01:50:50,723
Why is her taste so bad?

1601
01:50:51,912 --> 01:50:53,892
That three Goddesses...

1602
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:57,060
Coming.
- Geetha and Sowmya!

1603
01:50:57,285 --> 01:50:59,788
Why are they here?

1604
01:50:59,987 --> 01:51:01,898
If they three meet, we're finished.

1605
01:51:03,291 --> 01:51:04,736
Go after the auto.

1606
01:51:05,326 --> 01:51:08,773
HVe girls! I'm coming!

1607
01:51:08,962 --> 01:51:10,737
He's going to them!

1608
01:51:10,931 --> 01:51:12,968
<i>smpnslop...</i>

1609
01:51:18,439 --> 01:51:19,918
Greetings to Goddesses!

1610
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:21,646
Greetings to Goddesses!

1611
01:51:22,076 --> 01:51:23,749
It's been many days since I met you.

1612
01:51:24,378 --> 01:51:25,982
It's been many days since I met you.

1613
01:51:27,214 --> 01:51:29,820
Why are you behaving like Sidhu, Sri Ham?

1614
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:33,026
Why are you doing like Sidhu, Sri Ham?
- Yes, why am I doing?

1615
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:35,325
I'm free, right? I'll tell you.

1616
01:51:35,856 --> 01:51:37,927
This is an exercise to
normalize Sidhu.

1617
01:51:38,125 --> 01:51:39,763
It's Paga like Yoga.

1618
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:43,339
It's a practice of behaving like
normal man to treat a mad man.

1619
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:46,337
See, Sidhu will act like Sri Ham
and vice versa!

1620
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:47,440
They'll do it.

1621
01:51:51,906 --> 01:51:53,044
Baby, head and shoulder?

1622
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,947
Baby, head and shoulder?

1623
01:51:57,244 --> 01:51:58,279
What's this?

1624
01:52:00,247 --> 01:52:01,726
I don't get anything, don't confuse me.

1625
01:52:01,915 --> 01:52:03,223
Are we not confused ourselves?

1626
01:52:03,417 --> 01:52:05,727
Don't create new confusion,
just follow them .

1627
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:06,694
Look at them!

1628
01:52:07,854 --> 01:52:09,299
Shake hands with her.

1629
01:52:09,723 --> 01:52:10,292
Give.

1630
01:52:11,792 --> 01:52:12,361
I'll not give.

1631
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:13,796
Sri Ham, you wait.

1632
01:52:14,028 --> 01:52:15,098
Sidhu will give.

1633
01:52:17,498 --> 01:52:18,806
Sister ordered, do it.

1634
01:52:18,999 --> 01:52:20,376
If not she'll rip out the skin.

1635
01:52:25,206 --> 01:52:27,914
Now we'll change the girls.
- I'll do it.

1636
01:52:33,046 --> 01:52:35,458
Did you see? Sidhu is normal now,
this is what you wanted, right?

1637
01:52:35,816 --> 01:52:37,227
We'll meet you later.

1638
01:52:39,086 --> 01:52:40,292
Bye...
- You come with me.

1639
01:52:40,487 --> 01:52:41,488
Stop....stop...

1640
01:52:41,856 --> 01:52:42,425
Sister has told us to stop.

1641
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:44,428
I called you here to talk about
something else.

1642
01:52:44,792 --> 01:52:45,327
Tell me.

1643
01:52:45,526 --> 01:52:48,405
If Sowmya likes Sidhu,
I want to fix their marriage.

1644
01:52:48,763 --> 01:52:50,401
Marriage? How is it possible?

1645
01:52:51,332 --> 01:52:53,744
Who will give the bride to him?
- Why will they not?

1646
01:52:53,934 --> 01:52:55,072
Am I not a man?
Am I not young?

1647
01:52:55,269 --> 01:52:56,942
Young age, sweet sixteen,
you're 16 and I'm 18,

1648
01:52:57,137 --> 01:52:58,741
wife is house and lover in kitchen,

1649
01:52:58,939 --> 01:53:00,282
both are okay to me.

1650
01:53:00,474 --> 01:53:02,784
I don't know why Sri Ham is getting
involved in everything?

1651
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:06,355
Leaving Sidhu alone here,
all others please leave.

1652
01:53:06,513 --> 01:53:08,151
Will you talk to Sidhu?

1653
01:53:08,349 --> 01:53:10,852
We managed him with great difficulty
ﬁll now and leave him to you now.

1654
01:53:11,051 --> 01:53:13,930
If you three ask so many
questions at atime,

1655
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:15,532
how can kids like us manage it?

1656
01:53:15,889 --> 01:53:16,424
Shouldn't we be given ﬁmeto think?

1657
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:18,428
Do we've script for it?
What do you think of it?

1658
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:20,772
Sidhu has gone mad because of you.

1659
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:24,966
All three are playing a dram a,
they're manipulating something.

1660
01:53:25,165 --> 01:53:27,441
All three are flirts and
he's the biggest flirt among them.

1661
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:29,371
Shall I finish her story?
- ls it?

1662
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:34,883
I can't tolerate this word flirt,
get that big bat and take them to task.

1663
01:53:35,075 --> 01:53:35,951
Didn't bring the bad, I've belt.

1664
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:37,383
What do you think of yourself?

1665
01:53:37,577 --> 01:53:38,783
I'll hang you with belt.

1666
01:53:38,979 --> 01:53:40,117
If you're ice cream , I'm cone ice cream.

1667
01:53:40,314 --> 01:53:42,794
I thrashed 50 women with one hand!
- Get lost man!

1668
01:53:46,821 --> 01:53:47,891
What happened?

1669
01:53:48,322 --> 01:53:50,495
I took finance from MB Jagan
in Punganur.

1670
01:53:50,857 --> 01:53:53,531
I bought peas from Karri Jagadish
in bazaar.

1671
01:53:53,894 --> 01:53:55,305
No sprouts yet.

1672
01:53:55,495 --> 01:53:57,475
I wanted to sow in Indira park.

1673
01:53:58,565 --> 01:54:00,374
MS Raju must develop six pack.

1674
01:54:00,567 --> 01:54:03,377
I'm gem of men, I think I must coach him.

1675
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:06,483
Once up on atimethere's a sky,
there's cloud in sky...

1676
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,184
There's a tune behind the cloud...
tune melted the cloud...

1677
01:54:09,376 --> 01:54:10,480
The melting cloud turned as
drops of rain...

1678
01:54:10,844 --> 01:54:14,815
I want you to be the parrot...

1679
01:54:15,416 --> 01:54:16,190
I can't do it anymore, brother.

1680
01:54:16,383 --> 01:54:19,193
Did you see?
Do you want all of us to go mad?

1681
01:54:19,386 --> 01:54:20,490
Do you want that to happen?

1682
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:23,164
He'll surely go mad.
I'll go mad.

1683
01:54:23,357 --> 01:54:24,392
Do you want Sidhu to recover or not?

1684
01:54:24,591 --> 01:54:25,592
Do you want Sidhu to recover or not?

1685
01:54:25,959 --> 01:54:26,494
He must recover.

1686
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:28,897
Then leave the place silently.

1687
01:54:29,096 --> 01:54:31,133
Shake your hands...say bye...

1688
01:54:31,331 --> 01:54:32,105
Smile please...

1689
01:54:32,299 --> 01:54:34,939
My marriagemyou promised
marriage with her.

1690
01:54:39,139 --> 01:54:41,016
We got saved!

1691
01:54:41,241 --> 01:54:43,016
She promised to get me married to her.

1692
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:46,282
He has started knowing woman.

1693
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,359
Be careful.
- Leave m e.

1694
01:54:55,155 --> 01:54:56,327
They're taking away Sidhu!

1695
01:54:56,523 --> 01:54:57,968
You're not Sidhu, he's Sidhu!

1696
01:54:58,192 --> 01:55:00,866
ls that mad man Sidhu? That's Sidhu!

1697
01:55:01,228 --> 01:55:02,263
Why should I keep quiet?

1698
01:55:02,463 --> 01:55:04,136
ls Sri Ham Sidhu?

1699
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:08,471
You promised to bring him back in a week,
you made him bash women.

1700
01:55:08,669 --> 01:55:10,945
She lodged a complaint with me.

1701
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:14,882
Had she met my superintendent,
I would've lost my job.

1702
01:55:16,009 --> 01:55:18,421
Can mad men help you in your love story?

1703
01:55:18,612 --> 01:55:20,455
He's the boy who loved us.

1704
01:55:20,647 --> 01:55:22,149
What sort of man are you?

1705
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:27,892
For breaking his love with us,
he has trapped you in love as revenge.

1706
01:55:28,221 --> 01:55:30,394
You say you're an expert
in psychology, right?

1707
01:55:30,591 --> 01:55:32,229
Did you fall in love with him?

1708
01:56:24,544 --> 01:56:32,964
On the tip of the lip...the words stopped...

1709
01:56:34,188 --> 01:56:42,130
In the heart of
ove...it burnt like bier...

1710
01:56:42,329 --> 01:56:51,374
Legs moved towards parting ways...

1711
01:56:51,571 --> 01:56:56,571
This mark on my heart is
a never healing wound...

1712
01:57:03,049 --> 01:57:11,059
We're together for the start of the story...

1713
01:57:12,559 --> 01:57:17,167
Don't know what are we to each other...

1714
01:57:17,364 --> 01:57:20,368
In the end it's we...

1715
01:57:34,081 --> 01:57:37,392
6 months later...

1716
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:10,053
Father, I want an answer
for a question.

1717
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:16,724
If your question is pure,
Lord will answer through me,

1718
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:19,434
I promise, ask your question.
- Okay, Father.

1719
01:58:19,626 --> 01:58:24,097
A boy Sidhu made many mistakes
for the love of a girl Chitra,

1720
01:58:24,297 --> 01:58:32,239
he told blatant lies,
he became a cheat to her.

1721
01:58:32,472 --> 01:58:35,351
This is not question but conclusion.

1722
01:58:35,675 --> 01:58:38,485
You said you'll ask question
but giving an answer.

1723
01:58:38,678 --> 01:58:42,091
But I need your questionmquestion!

1724
01:58:42,482 --> 01:58:43,688
listen, Father!

1725
01:58:44,284 --> 01:58:47,493
For her love, he took up on himself
to look after a mad man,

1726
01:58:47,687 --> 01:58:49,860
and faced many difficulties,

1727
01:58:50,223 --> 01:58:52,430
should I consider him as good lover?

1728
01:58:53,326 --> 01:58:59,504
Should I consider him a cheat
for trying to do anything for her?

1729
01:58:59,699 --> 01:59:02,771
What should I think of him?
Please tell me, Father.

1730
01:59:03,136 --> 01:59:06,174
Look Chitra Balasubramanyam...

1731
01:59:06,439 --> 01:59:11,445
How do you know me?
- I know...l know about you completely.

1732
01:59:11,645 --> 01:59:14,649
For creating a character like you,

1733
01:59:14,848 --> 01:59:18,557
God created Sidhu to make
you fall in love with him,

1734
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:21,322
do you know this?

1735
01:59:21,521 --> 01:59:24,468
Other than Sidhu if anyone else
had fallen in love with you,

1736
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:27,298
you would've broken it yourself,

1737
01:59:28,495 --> 01:59:30,475
you hate love so much,

1738
01:59:30,664 --> 01:59:32,507
and he has changed a girl like you,

1739
01:59:32,699 --> 01:59:36,738
how sweet and soft his love is!

1740
01:59:37,838 --> 01:59:41,149
You see only flirts in boys and
can't see friends in them,

1741
01:59:41,341 --> 01:59:44,322
but you've come to a Father
in search of your love,

1742
01:59:44,511 --> 01:59:45,888
is he a cheat?

1743
01:59:47,247 --> 01:59:47,884
No!

1744
01:59:48,248 --> 01:59:49,522
He's true lover!

1745
01:59:51,451 --> 01:59:54,591
I'll tell a word to make
you understand it.

1746
01:59:55,756 --> 02:00:00,227
You get closer to the people
you want to avoid.

1747
02:00:01,361 --> 02:00:05,503
You sold the people you praise.
You go out with people you scold.

1748
02:00:05,799 --> 02:00:07,904
This is manufacturing defect.

1749
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:11,546
Neither it is Freudis psychology
nor my philosophy,

1750
02:00:14,608 --> 02:00:17,851
in the past when he was in love
with other girls, you ruined his love,

1751
02:00:18,211 --> 02:00:20,782
you made him to fall in love with you,

1752
02:00:24,384 --> 02:00:26,625
by the way you wanted an answer, right?

1753
02:00:27,621 --> 02:00:29,862
As far as I know he's your perfect match.

1754
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:33,295
You both are a couple
decided by God.

1755
02:00:37,797 --> 02:00:42,246
For the pastG months loving you and
like an answer without question,

1756
02:00:42,435 --> 02:00:44,312
burning himself,

1757
02:00:44,504 --> 02:00:47,542
he's melting away like candle
with remorse.

1758
02:00:47,741 --> 02:00:48,811
Look there!

1759
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:05,402
If you still hate him, punish him.

1760
02:01:05,592 --> 02:01:07,003
He'll accept with love.

1761
02:01:32,519 --> 02:01:35,864
If you bow your head in shame,
will your sins get washed away?

1762
02:01:48,068 --> 02:01:51,538
You mustn't have the guilt of cheating
to make me fall in love with you.

1763
02:01:51,738 --> 02:01:52,876
That's why I slapped you.

1764
02:01:53,873 --> 02:01:55,875
Do you know what your mistake was?

1765
02:01:56,543 --> 02:01:59,820
Lying to you.
- No, to love me.

1766
02:02:00,847 --> 02:02:03,293
To make me fall in love with you.

1767
02:02:24,103 --> 02:02:25,639
Is it first time?

1768
02:02:26,106 --> 02:02:27,312
First time?

1769
02:02:27,741 --> 02:02:28,742
Hugging!

1770
02:02:29,509 --> 02:02:31,045
I promise on you, this is first time.

1771
02:02:31,411 --> 02:02:34,324
One who promises unnecessarily
is a flirt.

1772
02:02:34,914 --> 02:02:35,756
Flirt?

1773
02:02:36,883 --> 02:02:37,657
Me?

1774
02:02:41,855 --> 02:02:45,826
Not here, my son.
Go outside.
