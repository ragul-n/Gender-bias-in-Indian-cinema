Shut up!

Boss, let's go back.

Boss, where are you going?
Boss, look out!

l have been shot!

12
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,631
Stupid man! lt was not a shot,
the tyre has burst.

00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:53,831
Jaggu, is this Dheerajpur?

14
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:56,328
Yes boss, it looks like Dheerajpur.

15
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:58,950
You change the tyre, . . .

arrange for this. - No boss!

you will spend the night there.

got under my truck.

84
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:40,951
lt's true. And it's also true
that l didn't try to escape. . .

opportunity to escape.

Don't scream, talk with respect.
This is a court.

l could have escaped but l didn't.

88
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:56,935
ls the police so incompetent

91
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:08,507
He is a rogue and a drunkard too.

look at that helpless woman.

The court is adjourned till
the 25th of this month.

What can be proved is the truth. . .

96
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:54,626
. . . and what can't
be proved is false.

97
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:57,832
You should raise your voice in
court to prove the truth. . .

98
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,829
. . . and you should also
dramatise the judgement.

99
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:04,992
l don't consider the court a stage.

100
00:16:06,116 --> 00:16:09,030
l don't want to be a
toy in the hands of law.

101
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:12,486
The court is a
sanctimonious place where. . .

102
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:15,315
. . . justice is done.

103
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:18,644
lt's not a stage, Mr.Saxena.

104
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,558
The whole world is a stage
and the court is no exception.

105
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:28,053
You'll get used to the
system as you proceed.

106
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:47,366
You and here!?

107
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:52,237
- You are our saviour.
- You shouldn't have come here.

108
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:55,900
lf you have to say something,
you may say it in court.

109
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,230
What am l going to gain
from your court, Sir?

110
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,060
Justice! Justice
will be done to you.

111
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:05,224
What will l gain
from that justice?

112
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:11,051
You may impose a severe
punishment on that convict. . .

113
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:17,045
Can your justice return
to me my husband. . .

114
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:21,208
. . . whom l adored, who wanted
to educate my children. . .

115
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:27,244
. . . and whose duty was to
get his sister married?

116
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:32,946
Look at my handicapped
father-in-law.

117
00:17:33,196 --> 00:17:36,192
And my mother-in-law is blind.

118
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:40,106
My husband was their only support.

119
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:47,099
Can your law return
their support to them?

120
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:53,093
Sir! When you inflict
punishment on the convict. . .

121
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,172
. . . you may also impose a death
sentence on our orphaned family.

122
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:10,824
Let's go, father.

123
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:35,592
Law is blind and has no
room for any emotions.

124
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,173
lt demands proof.

125
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,128
Once the crime is proved, . . .

126
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:43,001
. . . it turns a blind eye
to the rest of the things.

127
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:47,164
lt's the duty of law to weigh the
crime committed by the culprit. . .

128
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:50,118
. . . on a weighing
scale and punish him.

129
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:55,988
l know, My Lord, and l have been
assigned this task as well.

130
00:18:57,154 --> 00:19:01,357
But l want to know
what penalty aims at?

131
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:05,978
lt aims at making the criminal
feel guilty, isn't it?

132
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:10,224
lt makes him realise that
he has committed a sin. . .

133
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,346
. . . and repent for his sins.
This feeling of repentance. . .

134
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:16,134
. . . makes his heart and soul pure.

135
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,216
No doubt, punishment aims at that.

136
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:24,210
Can this aim be achieved by
imprisoning the accused. . .

137
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:29,246
. . . and by chaining him
and treating him as a slave?

138
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:33,076
No my lord!

139
00:19:33,242 --> 00:19:36,198
l challenge that,
these punishments. . .

140
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:42,067
. . . will only provoke the
criminal to indulge in crimes.

141
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:45,188
You are not only a genius
but you're also very clever.

142
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:48,061
But this Penal Code which
is drafted id based on. . .

143
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:50,391
. . . our knowledge
and experience.

144
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:53,222
Books on law have also been
written based on that.

145
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:56,177
Do you want to say
that they are wrong?

146
00:19:56,178 --> 00:20:01,048
No My Lord! Knowledge and
experience can never go wrong.

147
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:04,376
But it is definitely wrong. . .

148
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:07,291
. . . to restrict that knowledge
and experience.

149
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,288
After all, these books
are written by man.

150
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:15,283
Man's knowledge explores
many paths and. . .

151
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:19,279
. . . finds different
avenues to progress.

152
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:24,441
Will the last page of the
book be the last page forever?

153
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,561
As per the lndian Penal Code, . . .

154
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,101
. . . l can impose a
rigorous imprisonment. . .

155
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:33,432
. . . for two years
to the truck driver.

156
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:38,260
But l want to know what
the deceased's family. . .

157
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:42,256
. . . will gain out of this.

158
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:48,250
lt is the duty of law not only
to punish but also safeguard.

159
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,246
You are not only clever
but you're a genius too.

160
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:54,410
l appreciate you for that.

161
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:58,116
But, the question is,
whether the deceased's family. . .

162
00:20:58,281 --> 00:21:00,404
. . . will gain if the
accused is acquitted.

163
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:05,316
l never said that, l only
want to acquit that culprit.

164
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,270
l too want to punish him, but. . .

165
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:11,144
. . . l want to impose
a punishment. . .

166
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:15,305
. . . that will retain the
humility of man and. . .

167
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:19,302
. . . and put an end to the
sacrifices that man has made.

168
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:23,340
l want to experiment something.

169
00:21:24,464 --> 00:21:28,335
This experiment will give an
opportunity to the culprit. . .

170
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,331
. . . to seek recourse to his
sins and simultaneously. . .

171
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:36,327
. . . it will also benefit
the deceased's family.

172
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:40,823
And today l have come
to seek permission. . .

173
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:43,444
. . . to try this experiment.

174
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:47,191
l hope you will
grant me permission.

175
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:06,380
l grant you permission to
try out the experiment.

176
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:21,365
Considering the witnesses
and their statements. . .

177
00:22:22,698 --> 00:22:28,233
. . . the fact that an innocent
farmer was killed due to. . .

178
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:33,228
. . . the carelessness of Surjit Singh,
cannot be denied.

179
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:39,389
Hence, the court
penalises Surjit Singh. . .

180
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:43,385
. . . with 2 years
rigorous imprisonment.

181
00:22:46,674 --> 00:22:52,418
But the criminal won't spend
these two years behind bars, . . .

182
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:58,537
. . . he will have to spend these
2 years in the deceased's house.

183
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:10,442
During this period,
he will have to. . .

184
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:14,438
. . . sow and reap crops
in Ramdin's farm. . .

185
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:19,433
. . . provide for the
education of his kids. . .

186
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,512
. . . and also support
his ailing parents.

187
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:26,925
No my lord! What sort of
punishment is this?

188
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,630
l'd prefer to stay in jail.
Please don't send me there.

189
00:23:29,631 --> 00:23:34,959
Please don't be so harsh.

190
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:41,494
l know that it is not, yet. . .

191
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:45,448
. . . my judgement is final.

192
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,433
Get down!

193
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:06,844
Come with me.

194
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:10,215
This is the border of your jail.

195
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,503
Beyond that mountain.

196
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:16,792
And beyond the river
which you can see.

197
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,787
And look at that bridge.

198
00:24:20,788 --> 00:24:22,994
You cannot go across it.

199
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:26,157
lf you go, l'll run and catch you.

200
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:30,568
What are you looking?

201
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,400
Do you think l can't run?

202
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:37,812
When there's trouble,
l'm the first one to run.

203
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,558
- Understood?
- Yes.

204
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,555
These are the walls
of my jail, is it?

205
00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:48,969
- Now hear my name too.
- Tell me.

206
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:52,048
The villagers call me Headsahab.

207
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:54,128
- Even l will call you the same.
- Very good.

208
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:56,126
- Come on.
- Let's go.

209
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:58,334
Not here, walking.

210
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,830
The jeep does not
go inside the jail.

211
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:05,535
- Come.
- Let's go.

212
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:13,193
You scoundrel!

213
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:15,565
You sinner!

214
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:17,856
- Beat him!
- You murderer!

215
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,684
What is all this?

216
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:24,807
Headsahab, the Law
did not punish him.

217
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,553
Hand him over to us.

218
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:32,341
We will teach him a lesson.

219
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,332
Come. lf you have the courage,
come one by one.

220
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,579
- l deal with each one of you.
- No! You can't do that.

221
00:25:44,787 --> 00:25:46,784
lt is my job.

222
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:50,573
Dare if anyone steps forward.
l'll put each of you in jail.

223
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:54,652
He is a prisoner.
lt is illegal to raise hand on him.

224
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,858
Drop the weapons.

225
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:01,104
You too listen.
lf you fight with the villagers, . . .

226
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,642
You will be given the
same punishment . . .

227
00:26:03,643 --> 00:26:06,266
. . . which is given to a prisoner
for fighting in the jail.

228
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:11,676
Drop the stick.

229
00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:15,090
Come. Move aside.

230
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,127
Ganga Uncle!

231
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:27,453
Headsahab is coming to your
house with the prisoner.

232
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:48,306
Gangadin, he's the prisoner.

233
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,679
Today onwards he will stay here.

234
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,761
He has to serve his sentence
staying in your house.

235
00:27:20,316 --> 00:27:22,730
You scoundrel!

236
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:25,645
He is a prisoner.
lt is illegal to raise a hand on him.

237
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,307
Your law is great!

238
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:31,014
You brought my son's
murderer to my house.

239
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:36,509
And l can't do anything?

240
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:39,547
Don't feel offended.
Understood?

241
00:27:39,714 --> 00:27:42,377
After all he is a father.
A son's father.

242
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:44,792
Yes, l understood that
he is a father of a son.

243
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:47,498
- Or else he would dare to. . .
- May you be cursed!

244
00:27:47,955 --> 00:27:51,826
May you die a miserable death!

245
00:27:51,951 --> 00:27:54,532
May your family be destroyed!

246
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:57,361
Why are you cursing me?

247
00:27:57,362 --> 00:28:00,401
Anyway, there's no one
in my family, mother.

248
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,815
Keep quiet!
You call me mother?!

249
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,354
May you go to hell!

250
00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:07,727
Why do you argue with a
murderer, Ramu's mother?

251
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,348
Get out of my sight.

252
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:12,346
Yes, you go and sit there.

253
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:17,218
Go and sit there.

254
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:36,073
ls there a drama being shown?!
Go and do your work!

255
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:45,355
Take, eat it.

256
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,520
Who are you?

257
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:49,685
How you bring news about father?

258
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,974
Mother says father has gone
to town to being a bullock.

259
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:55,430
One of our bullock is dead.

260
00:28:57,011 --> 00:29:01,424
You are bleeding.
Wait, l'll bring medicine from mother.

261
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,835
Billu, come here.

262
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:09,124
Mother, he is wounded.
Give some medicine.

263
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,829
Get inside.

264
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,075
Come and sit here quietly.

265
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:17,407
Mother, who is he?

266
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:19,904
- He is our enemy.
- ls it?

267
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:22,902
Mother, give me food.
l'm hungry.

268
00:29:37,054 --> 00:29:39,968
- Take. - Puffed rice?
Give me 'roti', mother.

269
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:42,964
l'm very hungry.

270
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:45,672
Eat this now.
Eat 'roti' in the evening.

271
00:29:45,837 --> 00:29:48,042
No. l will eat 'roti' right now.

272
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:51,039
Give me one 'roti'.

273
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,619
Don't be stubborn.

274
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:14,392
Boss!

275
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:21,052
- Jaggu, you? - l was sitting
on the tree since so long.

276
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:24,382
l'll bring Mehmoodbhai's
truck at night near the river.

277
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:26,631
- You be ready.
- Very good, Jaggu!

278
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:29,169
Surely come.
l'm feeling suffocated in this hell.

279
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,957
Sure. Don't worry, boss.
l will definitely come.

280
00:30:56,683 --> 00:31:00,554
Father, l've brought food.

281
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:02,386
Eat it.

282
00:31:03,884 --> 00:31:06,549
Take away the lamp.
l don't like light.

283
00:31:07,506 --> 00:31:09,170
Eat the food, Ramu's mother.

284
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:11,958
You eat, l don't feel like eating.

285
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,665
Tell that murder to kill us too.

286
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:25,987
- Yes, mother?
- Close the door.

287
00:31:33,522 --> 00:31:38,516
They'll make me starve to death.

288
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:49,588
- Let's go, boss.
- Put off the torch.

289
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:50,463
Let's go.

290
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,163
Quiet!

291
00:31:59,578 --> 00:32:02,451
First tell me how did you
dare to run away like this?

292
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:06,072
Do you think there's no
guard around this jail?

293
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:08,027
So it is easy to escape?

294
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:11,608
No, inspector. But l used to get
two square meals in that jail.

295
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:13,980
ln this jail, l'm
hungry since morning.

296
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:15,603
No one asked me for water.

297
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:18,018
Who will ask you?
From whom do you expect food?

298
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:20,723
From those whom you have
deprived of a livelihood?

299
00:32:25,635 --> 00:32:30,007
l'm coming.

300
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,169
Go to my quarters and bring
something for him to eat.

301
00:32:34,294 --> 00:32:35,210
Okay, sir.

302
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:37,083
Sit down.

303
00:32:42,618 --> 00:32:46,697
You know, from where does a poor
farmer get bread for his family?

304
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:50,527
- From the land.
- Yes. And to get bread from the land . . .

305
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:53,066
. . . one has to work hard.

306
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:55,646
You have to plow Ramu's field.

307
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:58,144
This too is included
in your sentence.

308
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:02,515
Yes. But the crop doesn't
grow within a day.

309
00:33:02,806 --> 00:33:05,262
Then work hard.

310
00:33:05,263 --> 00:33:07,551
However possible,
it is your duty . . .

311
00:33:07,676 --> 00:33:10,133
. . . to provide Ramu's family
with two square meals.

312
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:16,293
l've brought food, sir.

313
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:20,831
Take, eat it.

314
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:28,821
Did you realize, what hungry is?

315
00:33:28,822 --> 00:33:31,196
Only one day's starvation has
made your condition like this.

316
00:33:32,195 --> 00:33:34,566
Think about that family who will
have to face starvation . . .

317
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:37,190
. . . all their lives because of you.

318
00:33:37,356 --> 00:33:39,811
Mother, please give me one 'roti'.

319
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,470
What happened?

320
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,549
No, lnspector.
My hunger is satisfied.

321
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:58,542
And if l have to serve the sentence,
l will do as you said.

322
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,164
- Can l go?
- Yes, go.

323
00:34:10,905 --> 00:34:13,195
Work fast.

324
00:34:18,107 --> 00:34:20,188
- What is it?
- Can l get some work?

325
00:34:20,355 --> 00:34:22,977
- What?
- l mean can l get some job?

326
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:27,265
- Who are you? - Manager,
he is the same truck driver . . .

327
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:30,177
. . . who had run down Ramu.

328
00:34:30,178 --> 00:34:32,093
Go away.

329
00:34:33,175 --> 00:34:37,920
Go from here.
There's no job.

330
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:44,039
- Who was this man?
- Who else can it be?

331
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,452
The new prisoner of the new law.

332
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:51,781
Great! Ramu's murderer has
come as his family's protector.

333
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,151
The thief has been
given the charge.

334
00:34:56,152 --> 00:34:59,232
Your examples are unique.

335
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:02,603
Tell me one thing. How is Ramu's
family managing their livelihood?

336
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:06,142
Nothing is well.

337
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:08,139
The children are
crying out of hungry.

338
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,469
He had fixed his sister's marriage.

339
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,176
But now even that won't take place.

340
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,799
Then what are you for?

341
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,924
Me?

342
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:18,171
What do you mean?

343
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:21,335
l mean, take advantage
of this chance.

344
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:25,372
They would need money
for the girl's marriage.

345
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:27,370
Ramu's stubbornness
is gone with him.

346
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:30,243
Now in this situation,
if we get his land . . .

347
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:32,781
. . . we can begin the
work of our farm.

348
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:35,196
Gangadin came early morning.

349
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:36,818
He asked for 2 kg.
wheat on credit . . .

350
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:38,775
. . . as the children were starving.

351
00:35:38,776 --> 00:35:42,688
Now tell me, there's no hope of
getting back the credit given. . .

352
00:35:42,855 --> 00:35:45,227
. . . given when Ramu was alive.

353
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:48,390
Shall l make my children
starve by giving more credit?

354
00:35:48,974 --> 00:35:51,013
That day the entire
village had attacked me . . .

355
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:53,220
. . . to take revenge
for Ramu's death.

356
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:55,717
And today when it came
to giving credit . . .

357
00:35:55,842 --> 00:35:58,214
. . . for his starving children,
you thought your children?

358
00:35:58,215 --> 00:36:00,794
Get lost!
Don't try to preach!

359
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:03,210
lt is your responsibility.
You take care of them.

360
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,789
Why?
Did the truth hurt you?

361
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,288
l remember everything.
You don't need to remind me.

362
00:36:08,787 --> 00:36:09,703
Fatso!

363
00:36:16,863 --> 00:36:19,526
Hey, if you want to drink water
for free, go to the river.

364
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,857
Keep the container down.

365
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:24,730
Okay, l won't drink.
Why are you screaming?

366
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,640
Here is your container!

367
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:33,013
You broke my glass!
l'll teach you a lesson.

368
00:36:33,014 --> 00:36:37,384
Get lost!
What can you do?

369
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:44,003
Damn this Thagdu!
lt had to break down.

370
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,582
lt will work only if
it is handled properly.

371
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:50,787
He treats my tractor
like a bullock cart.

372
00:36:51,162 --> 00:36:53,284
Since l bought it,
l am facing trouble.

373
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:57,447
They should've given a mechanic
along with the tractor.

374
00:37:01,526 --> 00:37:05,480
What are you doing?
You will ruin it.

375
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:09,476
lt is not my fault,
it just stopped midway?

376
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,765
lt is not your fault
it is my fault.

377
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,887
Now there won't be
any work for 6 days.

378
00:37:14,888 --> 00:37:16,219
The work is at a stand still.

379
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,299
God knows when the mechanic
will come from the city?

380
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,048
When he will repair it?
And will the field be ploughed?

381
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:25,086
- Has the tractor broken down?
- Can't you see that?

382
00:37:25,502 --> 00:37:29,790
- Was l singing till now?
- l mean, can l repair it?

383
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,787
- You will repair it?
- Yes, l know a little about machines.

384
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:35,450
Then why wait?
Hurry up.

385
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:37,572
But how much do l have to pay you?

386
00:37:37,573 --> 00:37:40,113
When it's working, give me
how much ever you feel like.

387
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:44,482
Durga, come here.

388
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:48,188
- Do you know who he is?
- How do l know who he is?

389
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:51,102
- He is the one who killed Ramu.
- What? - Yes.

390
00:37:54,264 --> 00:37:56,471
Who can defy destiny?

391
00:37:56,971 --> 00:38:01,092
He didn't kill Ramu.
Ramu was killed by the mad Brinda.

392
00:38:01,299 --> 00:38:06,836
Everyone advised him not
to but the haunted field.

393
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:09,416
Greed ruins you.

394
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:13,621
After all he died.
He repaired it?

395
00:38:14,203 --> 00:38:17,825
This is very good.
You are a good mechanic.

396
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,489
- How much do l pay you?
- Whatever you feel like.

397
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:26,399
Will Rs. 20 do?
Okay, take Rs. 30. Here.

398
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:42,051
l don't want this.
l want bread.

399
00:38:44,964 --> 00:38:47,545
l cannot bear this anymore.

400
00:38:48,128 --> 00:38:52,457
lf l sit on a road, being blind
l'll atleast get some alms.

401
00:38:54,996 --> 00:39:01,156
Billu, don't cry.

402
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:10,647
l have got some food.
l had got some money.

403
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:25,050
Here child.
Eat it.

404
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,672
Kamla, throw all of this.

405
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:32,042
We'll starve to death, but won't
eat anything this murderer gives.

406
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:38,535
What are you looking at?
Go!

407
00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:09,088
- Throw that away!
- No, l'll eat it. l am hungry.

408
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:16,789
- You are hungry! l said not to eat it!
- What're you doing?

409
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,784
Go die some place,
so that l get some peace.

410
00:40:30,484 --> 00:40:35,437
- Where are you going child?
- Enemy uncle, l'm going to die.

411
00:40:35,687 --> 00:40:37,935
Mother told me to go and die.

412
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:42,138
No child. You should not
say things like that.

413
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:47,342
You are hungry?
Come, l'll get you something to eat.

414
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:57,998
- Serve some water.
- Here, eat it.

415
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:04,075
Tell me, why did you
call me your Enemy uncle?

416
00:41:04,283 --> 00:41:06,989
Mother said that you are the enemy.

417
00:41:13,149 --> 00:41:19,393
Okay, you eat.
What happened now?

418
00:41:21,475 --> 00:41:26,344
Even brother went to school hungry.

419
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,629
- Look at this brother.
- Where did you get all this from?

420
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:39,539
- Enemy uncle gave it.
- Throw all of it.

421
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,078
- Why? - Because we shouldn't
eat anything he gives.

422
00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:47,699
- Why? What happened?
- He is a sinner! He is a murderer!

423
00:41:49,155 --> 00:41:52,526
Listen to me child.

424
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:57,355
l don't want to hear anything.

425
00:41:58,354 --> 00:42:01,226
l have done many
crimes in my life, . . .

426
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:04,223
. . . but never considered
myself a criminal.

427
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:08,677
Today for the first time,
after seeing you. . .

428
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:11,965
. . . l felt that l am
a very big criminal.

429
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:15,045
Child, let me repent for my sins.

430
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:20,749
lf you stay hungry,
my sins will increase.

431
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:24,828
Won't you help me?

432
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:29,282
Go on child.
Eat something.

433
00:42:37,939 --> 00:42:42,768
Here are Rs. 1 0.
lt will be enough for 2-3 days.

434
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:44,682
But where did you
get this money from?

435
00:42:44,683 --> 00:42:49,262
You won't know. The Manager of
Mr. Sarju is a very good man.

436
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:53,133
He himself called me
and loaned me Rs. 1 0.

437
00:42:53,258 --> 00:42:57,129
And said that he will employ
daughter-in-law and Kamla.

438
00:42:58,253 --> 00:43:00,582
ls this good news?

439
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:03,123
Both of them will work
and we will sit idle?

440
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,493
Aren't you ashamed?

441
00:43:06,494 --> 00:43:11,864
So what? lt's better to work hard
and earn rather than begging.

442
00:43:13,404 --> 00:43:17,109
Since he is not there,
his responsibilities are mine.

443
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:59,566
- What is the matter?
- Look, Lallu and Billu are not there.

444
00:43:59,899 --> 00:44:01,939
That man is also not there.

445
00:44:02,313 --> 00:44:03,354
O God!

446
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:15,800
- What happened Kamla?
- Lallu and Billu are missing.

447
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:19,254
The bull is also not in the shed
and even that man is not seen.

448
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:24,541
- What are you saying?
- O God! What is my family facing!

449
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:29,037
Don't worry.
Worrying won't solve our problems.

450
00:44:29,286 --> 00:44:31,658
l'll go and check.
Kamla come along with me.

451
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:35,031
- Daughter-in-law!
- Mother.

452
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,819
He will sell the bull
and escape to the city.

453
00:44:38,152 --> 00:44:40,525
And he'll kill my children!

454
00:44:42,024 --> 00:44:44,353
No child, don't say that.

455
00:44:44,354 --> 00:44:46,394
Bhola, come along with me.

456
00:44:46,686 --> 00:44:49,849
Come on.
Come on!

457
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:55,011
Where are you going
early in the morning?

458
00:44:55,343 --> 00:45:00,714
What do l say? That devil has
taken both my kids some place.

459
00:45:01,337 --> 00:45:04,002
Yes. He went this way.
He even had a bull.

460
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:07,039
- Really?
- Yes.

461
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,288
Push harder!

462
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,780
- Come on!
- Damned!

463
00:45:18,654 --> 00:45:23,274
- You are foolish. - Yes.
- The field is not ploughed like this.

464
00:45:23,441 --> 00:45:27,311
What do l do child, no one in my
family ever ploughed a field.

465
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:32,056
Don't worry. We three. . .
We even have him.

466
00:45:32,181 --> 00:45:35,845
All of us together will
plough the field in 6-7 days.

467
00:45:36,011 --> 00:45:38,467
- Shall we try?
- Yes, come on.

468
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:42,588
Come on!

469
00:45:43,421 --> 00:45:48,291
Father, look over there.

470
00:45:53,411 --> 00:45:57,365
- Billu, listen!
- Rascal, what are you laughing at?

471
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:03,774
Aren't you happy killing my son?
Now, you want to kill them too?

472
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,689
You will plough the field!
Had your father ever ploughed?

473
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:12,933
You are of no use.
Go, get drunk and kill people.

474
00:46:13,765 --> 00:46:19,385
This is my Ramu's land.
His soul is in this land.

475
00:46:19,842 --> 00:46:23,381
You want to taint it?
Get out from here!

476
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:28,376
- Rascal! Scoundrel! - Old man,
l've been tolerating from long.

477
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:32,746
Even that day you hit me.
l even bled but l tolerated it.

478
00:46:33,037 --> 00:46:35,118
l am not a farmer like
you to plough the field.

479
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:38,407
l felt guilty seeing these children
and realized my crime. . .

480
00:46:38,616 --> 00:46:40,904
. . .or else, to hell with you
and this field of yours!

481
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:43,486
- What did you say! - Get lost!
Listen to one more thing.

482
00:46:43,777 --> 00:46:46,981
lf l drink, l drink it with
my money and not yours.

483
00:46:47,148 --> 00:46:51,685
Understand? Move!

484
00:46:55,972 --> 00:46:58,512
Work faster.
We need lots of goods.

485
00:47:06,546 --> 00:47:09,376
- l am Malti Manager.
- Oh yes, Malti. Come.

486
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:13,164
- You talk to father about work.
- So, l didn't lie.

487
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:17,076
But you have come alone?
Where is your sister-in-law?

488
00:47:17,285 --> 00:47:20,698
Manager, you know that she
is going to be married.

489
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:24,652
lf she starts working,
people will start talking.

490
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,732
- lf you give me work. . .
- Sure. lt's no problem

491
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:32,353
Our boss is very king.
He keeps an eye on everyone.

492
00:47:32,562 --> 00:47:37,224
Here he comes.

493
00:47:37,764 --> 00:47:40,471
- Malti has come.
- Alone? Her sister-in-law?

494
00:47:40,761 --> 00:47:47,046
We want the land. Right now you
forget about romance for a while.

495
00:47:47,671 --> 00:47:48,712
Come.

496
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:02,614
Come Malti.
This is our jungle's godown.

497
00:48:02,864 --> 00:48:05,194
lt is a very huge business.

498
00:48:05,195 --> 00:48:08,192
lt runs day and night.
And many people work here.

499
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:13,020
- Haria. - Yes! - She's Malti.
She'll manage everything here.

500
00:48:13,187 --> 00:48:15,436
She will come and
go as she pleases.

501
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:19,930
- Okay Manager. - Consider her
to be the Manager from now on.

502
00:48:21,012 --> 00:48:25,508
ls that fine Malti.

503
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:37,205
l am a murderer!

504
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:44,448
l am a scoundrel!

505
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:14,583
Hey, Lord Shiva!
Where are you?

506
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:19,497
You took away my driving license.

507
00:49:20,287 --> 00:49:24,823
l cannot drive, but no one
can stop me from drinking.

508
00:49:25,656 --> 00:49:31,525
That is why l will drink more
and that too in front of you.

509
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:37,519
lf you have the strength,
then stop me.

510
00:49:41,973 --> 00:49:45,012
- Listen Kamla!
- Who is it?

511
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,498
Don't be so upset Kamla.
Everything will be fine.

512
00:49:58,956 --> 00:50:03,493
l know Shekhar, along
with brother's death, . . .

513
00:50:04,118 --> 00:50:08,529
. . .all our dreams of
happiness have shattered.

514
00:50:09,862 --> 00:50:11,985
Brother has promised your father. . .

515
00:50:12,194 --> 00:50:16,231
. . .that he will sell the crop
and pay for the dowry.

516
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:21,641
But now neither will
our farm have crops, . . .

517
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:24,638
. . . nor will the promise given to
your father will be fulfilled.

518
00:50:25,014 --> 00:50:27,552
No Kamla.
This will never happen.

519
00:50:29,343 --> 00:50:31,715
l will surely convince my father.

520
00:50:32,007 --> 00:50:35,337
Your father will
never agree Shekhar.

521
00:50:36,378 --> 00:50:40,332
And Shekhar, if
even you leave me. . .

522
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:45,826
- . . . l'll really drown in the river.
- No Kamla.

523
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:50,029
- l will die!
- No Kamla, it won't happen.

524
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:53,194
- Kamla, listen to me.
- All of you die!

525
00:50:53,526 --> 00:50:55,607
There won't be a marriage
if there is no crop!

526
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:57,981
l am not a farmer who
ploughs the fields.

527
00:51:25,411 --> 00:51:28,740
Look at that l didn't lie.

528
00:51:28,741 --> 00:51:29,615
Get him.

529
00:51:29,782 --> 00:51:35,110
l'll just get him sir.

530
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:48,098
- Move! - Stop! l said stop.
- Move aside!

531
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:52,676
Aren't you listening.
Do you want to run over me?

532
00:51:52,968 --> 00:51:57,296
- Hey, stop!
- l said move aside. Let me work.

533
00:52:00,793 --> 00:52:02,457
Oh God!

534
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:06,662
Didn't l tell you to
let me finish my work?

535
00:52:10,117 --> 00:52:14,445
You make fun of me.
Come on, get down.

536
00:52:14,779 --> 00:52:17,734
Come with me to sir.
Come!

537
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:26,432
Now you will learn a lesson.

538
00:52:26,433 --> 00:52:32,344
- Sir, l got him.
- What are you waiting for? Arrest him.

539
00:52:33,094 --> 00:52:37,714
To take someone elses things
without permission is theft.

540
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:43,084
Why are you quiet?
Why don't you answer him?

541
00:52:44,457 --> 00:52:46,997
You had told me that l have
to plough Ramu's field.

542
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,660
l have just one bull,
where do l get another bull from?

543
00:52:49,869 --> 00:52:52,782
What are you acting smart for?

544
00:52:54,864 --> 00:52:57,278
Anyway, you shouldn't have
got the tractor like this.

545
00:52:58,194 --> 00:53:02,522
Actually, when his tractor
broke down, l had repaired it.

546
00:53:02,856 --> 00:53:07,309
What are you saying?
lf you repaired it, even l paid you.

547
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:11,015
Then give it on hire.
l am ready pay the rent.

548
00:53:11,847 --> 00:53:14,510
You talk very big!
Come on, give the rent.

549
00:53:14,677 --> 00:53:16,340
Do you give your tractor for hire?

550
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:21,005
Sir, no one in this village
can hire my tractor.

551
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:27,789
- How much's the rent? - Rs. 50.
But only Rs. 20 from him will do.

552
00:53:32,284 --> 00:53:33,907
- Here, take it.
- Sir, you are paying?

553
00:53:33,908 --> 00:53:36,363
He is a prisoner.
l will deduct it from his allowance.

554
00:53:37,529 --> 00:53:40,276
Sir, if you are going to deduct it,
why not give it to him?

555
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:43,565
He has already ploughed the
field, now he'll want seeds too.

556
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:46,146
He is a thief, he will
steal someone's seeds too.

557
00:53:46,353 --> 00:53:52,556
- Give to him only. - Keep his
tractor from where you got it.

558
00:53:52,848 --> 00:53:55,761
- Okay.
- And listen. Take this.

559
00:53:57,051 --> 00:54:00,756
This is your money.
l will deduct it from your allowance.

560
00:54:02,254 --> 00:54:06,250
Thank you lnspector.

561
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,914
Wait, l don't trust you,
l'll get into trouble. . .

562
00:54:08,915 --> 00:54:11,204
. . . if you run away with the
tractor to some other village.

563
00:54:11,412 --> 00:54:15,949
Yes, come along.

564
00:54:20,486 --> 00:54:21,443
Yes, sir.

565
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:34,597
Grandfather, he ploughed
our whole field.

566
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:53,911
- You turned out to be a useful man.
- What?

567
00:54:54,285 --> 00:54:59,197
l mean, the work you finished. . .

568
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:02,611
. . .will make Ramu's
soul rest in peace.

569
00:55:02,778 --> 00:55:05,858
- That. . . What is your name?
- Durgaprasad.

570
00:55:06,107 --> 00:55:09,146
l don't know that, but l
know this much, that. . .

571
00:55:09,646 --> 00:55:12,892
. . .the crop of this field will
help Ramu's sister get married.

572
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,181
She will get married. . .

573
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:19,219
. . . but what will her family
eat till the next year?

574
00:55:19,385 --> 00:55:22,841
l don't know that but Ramu
himself had taken this decision.

575
00:55:23,465 --> 00:55:25,879
That is why he had
bought the haunted field.

576
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:31,873
You mentioned it even that day.
What is this haunted field?

577
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:36,368
What do l say? The tree in
the middle of that field. . .

578
00:55:36,577 --> 00:55:40,115
. . . is the one on which the
crazy Brinda had hanged herself.

579
00:55:41,031 --> 00:55:43,861
The field has been
barren since years.

580
00:55:44,277 --> 00:55:48,690
Whenever anyone bought
that field, he paid with his life.

581
00:55:49,023 --> 00:55:53,185
- Do you believe in all this.
- Not only believe, we know it.

582
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:58,888
Even today the crazy Brinda's
soul dances in that field.

583
00:56:01,177 --> 00:56:04,632
- Why are you laughing?
- All this is nonsense.

584
00:56:05,173 --> 00:56:07,879
Mr. Durgaprasad, you
give me your tractor. . .

585
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:11,667
. . .then see l will take care of
that field along with that tree.

586
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,910
l thought you're a nice man,
but you turned out to be dangerous.

587
00:56:18,201 --> 00:56:21,282
Do you want to ruin me
along with my tractor?

588
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:25,736
Don't give me your tractor,
but l'll go to that tree tonight.

589
00:56:26,027 --> 00:56:30,731
Then go and hug him like
you did to your son Ramu.

590
00:56:31,022 --> 00:56:33,603
At least think before
you say anything.

591
00:56:34,686 --> 00:56:38,265
Ramu had expected a lot
from this year's crop.

592
00:56:38,764 --> 00:56:42,969
lf that field had stayed barren,
would his soul rest in peace?

593
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:47,089
We are handicap.
Our daughter-in-law has gone to work.

594
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:50,919
And we are not taking
his generosity.

595
00:56:51,252 --> 00:56:53,625
We will feed that dog some food. . .

596
00:57:14,687 --> 00:57:18,266
- What? - Didn't you hear?
We don't take anyone's favors.

597
00:57:41,285 --> 00:57:43,366
l got some money to buy seeds.

598
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:45,280
You will have to come
with me in the morning.

599
00:57:45,281 --> 00:57:47,404
l don't know anything
about farming.

600
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:54,772
l was thinking of ploughing the
other field that Ramu had bought.

601
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:02,431
No! That field took my Ramu's life.

602
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:06,344
No. l killed your son.

603
00:58:06,801 --> 00:58:09,757
l heard that whoever goes
there doesn't come back alive?

604
00:58:10,465 --> 00:58:14,211
lf that happens, then revenge for
Ramu's death will be taken. . .

605
00:58:14,627 --> 00:58:17,082
. . .and your enemy will be. . .

606
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:25,033
That scoundrel won't die alone,
he will kill all of us too.

607
00:58:25,325 --> 00:58:28,030
- Yes!
- Why do you worry?

608
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:34,316
- He will surely do something.
Get some more sweets. - Yes sir.

609
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:37,729
- Right sir?
- Yes.

610
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:42,224
- He has come.
- Salute sir. - Yes.

611
00:58:42,515 --> 00:58:44,971
- Did you call me?
- Yes.

612
00:58:44,971 --> 00:58:47,136
l have heard that
crazy Brinda's tree. . .

613
00:58:47,344 --> 00:58:49,216
l am going to fell it tonight.

614
00:58:49,217 --> 00:58:55,544
- What? - Yes. - Fool! You deed
will ruin the whole village.

615
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:58,458
l am not responsible
for the whole village.

616
00:58:58,999 --> 00:59:03,036
l've to take care of one family,
l'll do everything for them.

617
00:59:03,328 --> 00:59:06,325
- What do you mean?
- That l'll do everything possible.

618
00:59:07,366 --> 00:59:10,113
l'll hang you upside
down on that tree.

619
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,277
Why do you bother?
Crazy Brinda will do that.

620
00:59:13,526 --> 00:59:15,774
- So, you will go?
- Yes, and no one can stop me.

621
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:19,271
- Why? - Because, law is
not to fight with people. . .

622
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,893
. . . but not ghosts.
l am going.

623
00:59:25,848 --> 00:59:28,886
- He is going!
- l can see that.

624
00:59:29,344 --> 00:59:32,632
- All the food we gave you is wasted?
- Yes.

625
00:59:35,754 --> 00:59:38,710
- Priest, you do something.
- What can we do?

626
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,415
All of you give money, . . .

627
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:45,536
. . .we will perform the
ghost destruction ceremony.

628
01:00:36,568 --> 01:00:42,020
l got scared!

629
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:35,675
Let me see.

630
01:01:35,676 --> 01:01:37,715
Ghost. . . . . . .

631
01:01:37,716 --> 01:01:41,545
Where are you running away?
You cannot escape from me.

632
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:46,582
- Help!. . . . .
- You have terrorised the village.

633
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:58,694
Don't hit me.
l'm not a ghost.

634
01:01:58,695 --> 01:02:03,273
You aren't a ghost!
Why do you act like one!

635
01:02:03,398 --> 01:02:06,603
l was scared myself.
l heard of a ghost round here.

636
01:02:06,729 --> 01:02:08,726
Why are you here like a ghost?

637
01:02:08,727 --> 01:02:13,596
Shut up.
Do l look like a ghost to you?

638
01:02:13,722 --> 01:02:15,719
Who are you? What are you
doing here at this hour?

639
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,632
l'm Phulmati.
Came to hide my money here.

640
01:02:19,756 --> 01:02:23,253
This isn't a bank to hide money.
Don't lie.

641
01:02:23,752 --> 01:02:25,791
l'm not lying.
Look here.

642
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:29,247
My Grandpa steals it to spend
on drinks if l keep it at home.

643
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:34,283
People don't dare come here.
Thought my money is safe here.

644
01:02:34,741 --> 01:02:38,154
Why are you hiding
it from your uncle.

645
01:02:39,736 --> 01:02:42,609
- Speak up.
- For my marriage.

646
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:46,605
- When is your wedding?
- lt's not yet fixed.

647
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:49,602
lt isn't easy to find
a good boy these days.

648
01:02:52,765 --> 01:02:56,303
- Who are you anyway?
- Why do you bother?

649
01:02:56,512 --> 01:02:58,677
Remove your money from here fast.
l've to fell the tree.

650
01:02:58,801 --> 01:03:01,674
- Come on, quick.
- Okay, l'll.

651
01:03:03,796 --> 01:03:04,671
Go.

652
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:34,681
O god, my prisoner is dead!
l'll lose my job!

653
01:03:34,848 --> 01:03:38,345
- We got rid of the ghost.
- The hell with your ghost.

654
01:03:38,511 --> 01:03:41,716
Don't just stand.
Let's extricate his dead body.

655
01:03:43,797 --> 01:03:47,710
No one is coming!
Cowards.

656
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:51,706
Who will touch a sinner's body?

657
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:55,702
- Dushman ( enemy ) uncle. . . .
- Billu, stop there.

658
01:03:55,826 --> 01:04:01,322
- Dushman uncle. . . .
- Billu, dear. . . .

659
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:07,690
O god!
He is alive.

660
01:04:10,853 --> 01:04:14,725
- What's the matter?
- Uncle is dead.

661
01:04:14,891 --> 01:04:18,721
Dushman uncle's
enemies die not him.

662
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:22,717
- You have felled the tree!
- Yes.

663
01:04:22,883 --> 01:04:25,714
Thank god you aren't dead.
My job is saved.

664
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:29,377
You have done a miracle!

665

- Let's leave, Lallu.

667
01:04:35,911 --> 01:04:40,781
That won't cause me
a problem, l hope.

668
01:04:40,906 --> 01:04:45,776
That's all nonsense.
Give me tractor to start off my work.

01:04:45,901 --> 01:04:48,773
So, he has been cheating on us!

Hey, what are you doing?
l'll put all of you in lock up.

675
01:05:08,962 --> 01:05:14,457
Don't hit him.
Poor fellow is a poor Brahmin.

676
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:16,787
Poor fellow has done
it for survival.

677
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:22,781
Yes, my son.
You have saved a poor brahmin.

678
01:05:23,905 --> 01:05:26,777
- May god bless you.
- Okay, leave.

679
01:05:27,901 --> 01:05:30,773
Everyone proceed with their work.

Shut up. lt's our house and
she is our daughter-in-law.

686
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:21,014
Who are you to interfere?

687
01:06:21,015 --> 01:06:26,385
Fine, mother.

688
01:06:28,965 --> 01:06:32,878
- Barber? - Yes.
- Are you really a barber?

689
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,999
You have scrapped off my skin.

690
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,495
This is a hair cutting saloon.

691
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:42,868
Cut your hair here once.
Which cut do you want?

692
01:06:43,035 --> 01:06:45,032

- May l ask you something?
- Ask.

695
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:00,558
Didn't you really find
nothing in the fields?

696
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,555
- l found something.
- What?

697
01:07:04,014 --> 01:07:06,886
- A ghost.

698
01:07:07,011 --> 01:07:09,883
Then what happened?

699
01:07:10,008 --> 01:07:13,879

701
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:21,912
Then what happened?

702
01:07:22,037 --> 01:07:26,949

- The noise grew louder.

703
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:32,943

- lt's gone. - What is gone?

704
01:07:34,025 --> 01:07:36,939
- Half of it is gone.
- Half of it is gone!

705
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:40,601
O my mustache!
Are you a barber or a butcher?

706
01:07:41,018 --> 01:07:43,932
lt's not my mistake
but that ghost's.

707
01:07:47,054 --> 01:07:50,591
Where're you going? - Home. - Will
your uncle complete the shaving?

708
01:07:50,758 --> 01:07:53,630
My uncle has died long ago.
l'll do it.

709
01:07:54,047 --> 01:07:57,960
- Dushman uncle. . .
- lt's Billu. Finish it fast.

710
01:07:58,127 --> 01:08:00,957
- Uncle. . .

711
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:05,952
Where is my uncle? - Barber.
- Anything else to be done?

712
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:08,116
See what have you done!
My own people don't recognise me.

713
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,114
Where is your mustache?

714
01:08:10,115 --> 01:08:13,944
lt is all because of him.

715
01:08:14,111 --> 01:08:16,941
- l won't spare you.
- l'll close down my shop.

716
01:08:18,065 --> 01:08:20,937
- Uncle, l want to watch
the bioscope. - Sure.

717
01:08:21,104 --> 01:08:26,973
She wanted money to show me
the bioscope. Scolded me too.

718
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:29,594
- What did she say? - Stupid.
- How dare she say so?

719
01:08:32,466 --> 01:08:37,420
l'll take you to see it.

village you are the ghost.

755
01:13:22,343 --> 01:13:25,049
- May l go now?
- Go.

756
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:31,917
You owe me money.
Tell me your name.

757
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:38,285
Didn't you hear him call me uncle?
lt's for him, not for you.

758
01:13:42,407 --> 01:13:45,278
Wait, Durgabhiah.

759
01:13:45,445 --> 01:13:50,273
Hear what she calls me!

760
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:55,268
l told you many times that
my name is Durgaprasad.

761
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:58,599
What is in a name?

762
01:13:58,765 --> 01:14:02,261
l'm wondering about the law.

763
01:14:02,428 --> 01:14:08,339
A criminal is left in our village,
with many young girls.

764
01:14:08,464 --> 01:14:10,461
What if something goes wrong?

765
01:14:10,462 --> 01:14:14,333
He will do nothing.
l'll speak to him.

766
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:21,326
- You watch the ghost.
- Oh! he told them everything.

767
01:14:21,451 --> 01:14:25,988
He told only me no one else.
Don't fear.

768
01:14:26,112 --> 01:14:29,318
l'm not afraid.
lt's the villagers who are afraid.

769
01:14:29,443 --> 01:14:31,440
There is only one fearless man.

770
01:14:31,441 --> 01:14:37,393
- Here l'm.
- What! - Fearless.

771
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,388
l think she is hooked.

772
01:15:01,453 --> 01:15:07,363
Didn't you get some
other place to bathe?

773
01:15:07,529 --> 01:15:10,360
Why did you come here?

774
01:15:10,526 --> 01:15:13,399
She has a sharp tongue.

775
01:15:13,523 --> 01:15:16,396
- What!
- You won't understand.

776
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:21,391
lt flows through my farm.
Expect me to go to your house?

777
01:15:21,515 --> 01:15:24,388
Come if you have the guts.

778
01:15:24,512 --> 01:15:28,050
l heard that you
think l'm fearless!

779
01:15:30,506 --> 01:15:33,379
Okay.
Turn that way and sit down.

780
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,500
- Why?
- l have to change.

781
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:40,537
Oh, l understand.

782
01:15:40,538 --> 01:15:44,409
- May ask something?
- Turn the other way first.

783
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:49,029
- Ask now.
- You care a lot about me these days.

784
01:15:49,238 --> 01:15:52,443
You like me l presume.

785
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:59,103
Why don't you talk, you ghost.

786
01:16:06,512 --> 01:16:11,424
My prediction can never go wrong.

787
01:16:11,549 --> 01:16:13,587
You will become inspector soon.

788
01:16:13,588 --> 01:16:16,460
When will that happened?

789
01:16:16,627 --> 01:16:19,457
That will happen soon . . .

790
01:16:19,624 --> 01:16:25,451
. . . after you clear few hurdles.

791
01:16:25,618 --> 01:16:30,446
Sure. Please tell me further.

792
01:16:30,613 --> 01:16:33,567
Stretch you hand.

793
01:16:33,568 --> 01:16:39,271
- Greetings, constable.
- Don't bother me now.

794
01:16:39,562 --> 01:16:43,475
l was passing by
the police station.

795
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,472
l heard the inspector
shout about you.

796
01:16:46,597 --> 01:16:49,469
O god.
l'll come later.

797
01:16:49,636 --> 01:16:53,507
Go. Don't turn back.
Your time is bad.

798
01:16:54,589 --> 01:16:59,459

- Your hand is soft!

01:17:14,569 --> 01:17:18,648
Give it to me.
Show me your hand.

804
01:17:18,649 --> 01:17:23,518
- You sing and dance a lot.
- That is for my business.

805
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:29,512
- Are you related to a drunkard?
- He is my uncle.

806
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:35,174
Nevermind. Your hand shows
someone else in your life too.

807
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:39,169
- What!
- You will be married soon.

808
01:17:39,336 --> 01:17:41,542
Your husband will be a soldier.

809
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:45,538
A soldier!
But he is a criminal.

810
01:17:45,663 --> 01:17:52,156
- What?
- Nothing? Will he be fat?

811
01:17:52,364 --> 01:17:58,233
He will be tall and slim.
He will be your choice.

812
01:17:58,358 --> 01:18:03,228
- He will carry a gun always.
- l'm scared of guns!

813
01:18:03,353 --> 01:18:05,350
Say, 'gun'.

814
01:18:05,351 --> 01:18:09,556
- May l ask you a question?
- lt's your 3rd and last one.

815
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:13,552
- Will it be a soldier?
- l said so already.

816
01:18:13,677 --> 01:18:17,881
l mean, cannot a
bad man ever change?

817
01:18:18,006 --> 01:18:23,542
Ofcourse.
Repentance can change him.

818
01:18:23,709 --> 01:18:26,205
Haven't you heard murderer
Ratnakar became. . .

l have heard, but. . .
- You asked 3 questions already.

821
01:18:35,739 --> 01:18:41,107
You may leave.

822
01:19:49,747 --> 01:19:52,662
'' O my soldier lover''

823
01:19:52,786 --> 01:19:57,657

'' and my heart beat races''

825
01:20:41,861 --> 01:20:46,690
'' Your romantic talk

'' and tells me how
much l'm in love''

827
01:20:51,851 --> 01:20:56,722
''There will be lot of talk
about us in the village''

828
01:20:56,846 --> 01:21:01,717
''Even our neighbours
will be aware. . .

829
01:21:03,839 --> 01:21:09,709
. . . of it when they hear
the jingle of my bangles''

830
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:56,786
''He refused to let me go''

831
01:21:56,953 --> 01:22:01,449
''But l'm in a dilemma
as to what l should do''

832
01:22:01,615 --> 01:22:06,444
''Oh God! My hand still hurts''

833
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:12,438
'' l'm in trouble''

834
01:22:12,604 --> 01:22:18,764
'' My anklets jingle''

835
01:22:46,945 --> 01:22:51,149
There was a time when villagers
were after his blood.

836
01:22:51,316 --> 01:22:54,811
Now they are willing
to die for him.

837
01:22:54,978 --> 01:22:58,891
As it is Durga is an
obstruction for us.

838
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:01,013
He is an addition.

839
01:23:01,014 --> 01:23:05,884
Don't worry. l can break
them anytime l want.

840
01:23:06,009 --> 01:23:09,505
But that can cause some damage.

841
01:23:09,963 --> 01:23:16,873
Why? - Come and see how
well he cultivated their farms.

842
01:23:16,998 --> 01:23:22,867
The yield can get
them lot of money.

843
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:27,652
Do something fast.

844
01:23:27,653 --> 01:23:29,902
Sure, sir.
There is a way if there is will.

845
01:23:52,005 --> 01:23:56,209
Father, see who has come.

846
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:01,911
- Who is it?
- Greetings. - Greetings.

847
01:24:02,036 --> 01:24:04,033
We are from Narayangunj
on behalf of Narayanbabu.

848
01:24:04,034 --> 01:24:08,529
From Narayanababu!
Please come in side.

849
01:24:13,025 --> 01:24:15,064
Daughter-in-law,
bring refreshments.

850
01:24:15,065 --> 01:24:17,062
There is no need for it.

851
01:24:17,063 --> 01:24:19,935
We are in a hurry.
We have to talk to you.

852
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:22,057
- Sure. Say it.
- Uncle, you say it.

853
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:27,927
- The matter is. . . .
- Okay, l'll tell him.

854
01:24:28,052 --> 01:24:32,257
You are aware that Shanker
is Narayababu's lone son.

855
01:24:32,463 --> 01:24:36,294
How long do we wait?
Marriage has to take place anyway.

856
01:24:36,459 --> 01:24:38,791
So, . . . . Uncle, you tell him.

857
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:42,079
So, Narayan was saying. . . .

858
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,119
Okay, l'll tell him.

859
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,950
Both the parties are helpless.

860
01:24:47,117 --> 01:24:49,947
l wonder if we can
break the engagement. . . .

861
01:24:50,114 --> 01:24:52,944
lt will save embarrassment
to both the parties.

862
01:24:53,111 --> 01:24:57,939
What are you saying!
lt will disgrace us.

863
01:24:58,106 --> 01:25:02,976
We cannot pressurise you.
We can see your condition.

864
01:25:03,101 --> 01:25:05,098
lt is evident that you cannot
fulfil your promise too.

865
01:25:05,099 --> 01:25:10,968
Why do you think so?
We will surely fulfil our promise.

866
01:25:11,134 --> 01:25:13,131
How long can we wait?

867
01:25:13,132 --> 01:25:15,129
Please give us few days time.

868
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:18,668
lt's okay if it is few
days and not months.

869
01:25:18,793 --> 01:25:22,997
l'll persuade Narayanbabu somehow.
Let's go, uncle.

870
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:35,068
Let's go, uncle.

871
01:25:35,069 --> 01:25:37,149
What have you done,
Daughter-in-law!

872
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:40,022
We manage 2 meals
with great difficulty.

873
01:25:40,147 --> 01:25:42,144
How can we manage it?

874
01:25:42,145 --> 01:25:46,058
Why, is it because Kamla's
brother isn't alive?

875
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:49,055
l'll talk to Mr.Sarju.

876
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:53,051
He is a nice person.
He'll surely help us.

877
01:25:53,176 --> 01:25:56,048
Don't you worry.

878
01:26:24,186 --> 01:26:29,555
What's the matter, father?

879
01:26:36,174 --> 01:26:40,045
- They are rogues.
- Ofcourse.

880
01:26:40,211 --> 01:26:43,083
Help her out with what she needs.

881
01:26:43,208 --> 01:26:47,079
That will be done.
l spoke to Malati already.

882
01:26:49,202 --> 01:26:51,241
Give them 1 000 rupees against
mortgage of their fields.

883
01:26:51,242 --> 01:26:56,112
You always talk of mortgage
while helping others.

884
01:26:56,237 --> 01:27:00,108
- lt's a bad habit.
- You are angry unnecessarily.

885
01:27:00,233 --> 01:27:04,228
They are farmers.
Self respecting.

886
01:27:04,229 --> 01:27:06,893
They don't accept
favours from others.

887
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:15,093
He is right. Give us temporary
loan against mortgage.

888
01:27:17,174 --> 01:27:21,129
- As you please. Mansuk. . .
- Don't delay in good deed.

889
01:27:21,253 --> 01:27:24,126
Next Wednesday is
Rakshabandhan day.

890
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:27,123
l'll prepare all documents by then.

891
01:27:29,245 --> 01:27:33,117
- ls it okay, sister?
- lt is fine, manager.

892
01:27:41,233 --> 01:27:45,105
There is no alternative.
Kamla's wedding is ahead.

893
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:47,267
They threatened to cancel
the engagement too.

894
01:27:47,268 --> 01:27:51,890
But you don't know
what a rogue Sarju is.

895
01:27:52,056 --> 01:27:56,802
You can give it up
once it's mortgaged.

896
01:28:00,255 --> 01:28:03,170
l toiled so much to
cultivate these fields.

897
01:28:03,294 --> 01:28:06,500
But they are the owners.
Let them do as they want.

898
01:28:07,249 --> 01:28:11,162
lt's all because of your generosity.
Else, my poverty. . .

899
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:15,824
Don't call yourself poor.
He is there to help you.

900
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:24,815
This document says your
fields are mortgaged with him.

901
01:28:24,981 --> 01:28:27,895
Pay back 1 000 rupees and take
it back whenever you can.

902
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:32,182
Here is 1 000 rupees.

903
01:28:36,969 --> 01:28:39,217
Why are you hesitating?

904
01:28:41,298 --> 01:28:44,212
Pick up the pen.

905
01:28:45,294 --> 01:28:48,208
Here is 1 000 rupees.
You may count it.

906
01:28:50,289 --> 01:28:54,202
- Fields won't be mortgaged.
- Why not?

907
01:28:54,327 --> 01:28:57,532
Because Ramu wanted to raise
money for the wedding by. . .

908
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,696
. . . selling the yield
and not by mortgaging it.

909
01:28:59,697 --> 01:29:02,152
So, it wont be mortgaged.

910
01:29:05,357 --> 01:29:08,022
Why don't you tell him that
we don't want even a grain. . .

911
01:29:08,188 --> 01:29:10,351
. . . from this sinner's hand.

912
01:29:10,352 --> 01:29:13,224
Yes, l'm a sinner.

913
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:15,346
But not the land.

914
01:29:15,347 --> 01:29:20,217
Father you used to say
fields are your son's soul.

915
01:29:20,342 --> 01:29:23,881
Do you want to mortgage
your son's soul?

916
01:29:24,338 --> 01:29:29,542
No need to insult us.
We came to do you a favour.

917
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:32,913
l know how generous
you are with the poor.

918
01:29:33,038 --> 01:29:35,910
Today you are so rich because
of doing favours to poor.

919
01:29:36,035 --> 01:29:38,949
But this household
doesn't need your favour.

920
01:29:39,032 --> 01:29:41,071
The law has entrusted their
responsibility with me.

921
01:29:41,072 --> 01:29:44,277
This's my house. Ramu's parents
are my parents. His sister is. .

922
01:29:44,402 --> 01:29:49,605
Tomorrow you will say
Ramu's wife is your wife.

923
01:29:50,354 --> 01:29:56,265
Let go off me.
Help. . . help.

924
01:29:59,345 --> 01:30:03,299
Why do you want to ruin us?
Get out of here.

925
01:30:05,381 --> 01:30:08,294
- Sorry, Mr. Mansukhbabu. . .
- That's enough.

926
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:13,289
- What's happening?
- We are being punished, not him.

927
01:30:15,454 --> 01:30:18,909
lt's all because of that unlucky girl.
Where is she?

928
01:30:22,447 --> 01:30:27,275
Her bad luck will never
change nor does she die.

929
01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:36,723
Kamla!
Don't cry.

930
01:30:36,724 --> 01:30:44,092
l wouldn't have to hear taunts
had my brother been alive.

931
01:30:45,924 --> 01:30:51,334
l wouldn't have to hear all this.

932
01:31:23,470 --> 01:31:26,883
Today is Rakshabandhan
(A festival).

933
01:31:28,797 --> 01:31:31,711
Please accept me as your brother.

934
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:36,873
Brother! Do you expect me
to tie this sacred thread. . .

935
01:31:36,997 --> 01:31:39,870
. . . around the wrist of
my brother's murderer?

936
01:31:40,952 --> 01:31:42,867
Never!

937
01:32:29,028 --> 01:32:31,942
- Let me go! - No!
- l said, let me go.

938
01:32:33,024 --> 01:32:36,105
- l don't want to live.
- No, Kamla!

939
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:39,934
Listen to me.
As it is l am burdened with a sin. . .

940
01:32:40,059 --> 01:32:42,848
. . . which cannot be atoned.

941
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:46,761
Please don't burden me
with yet another sin.

942
01:32:47,052 --> 01:32:51,922
Listen Kamla,
you're younger to me.

943
01:32:52,839 --> 01:32:58,791
l beg of you, please go home.

944
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,955
No!

945
01:33:04,077 --> 01:33:05,325
Go!

946
01:33:26,222 --> 01:33:29,093
Why are you sad, Dushman ( enemy )?

947
01:33:29,094 --> 01:33:31,923
You too call me an enemy?

948
01:33:31,924 --> 01:33:34,838
What should l do? You never
told me your real name.

949
01:33:36,586 --> 01:33:39,582
l too have forgotten my real name.

950
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:41,997
What l was and what l have become?

951
01:33:42,913 --> 01:33:45,077
Attachments are very strange.

952
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:47,991
l was a carefree person,
l had no responsibilities.

953
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:52,820
Had Ramu been alive, he'd
shoulder all responsibilities.

954
01:33:55,068 --> 01:33:59,022
His family has faced so many
problems due to my carelessness.

955
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:03,142
l'm a sinner.

956
01:34:03,143 --> 01:34:05,348
Although l'm compassionate
towards them, . . .

957
01:34:05,349 --> 01:34:09,968
. . . yet l'm their enemy, isn't it?

958
01:34:09,969 --> 01:34:15,006
lt is believed that repentance
washes away all sins.

959
01:34:15,963 --> 01:34:18,211
And an enemy is also
treated as a friend.

960
01:34:25,121 --> 01:34:29,282
Dushman uncle!

961
01:34:29,283 --> 01:34:31,031
- Come home at once.
- What's the matter?

962
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:34,652
Aunty's engagement
has been cancelled.

963
01:34:34,653 --> 01:34:36,568
Come on!

964
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:46,058
Father! ls it true that
Kamla's engagement. . .

965
01:34:48,347 --> 01:34:51,053
l won't let that happen.
l'll explain to them. . .

966
01:34:51,178 --> 01:34:54,050
. . . it's not fair on their part.

967
01:34:54,675 --> 01:35:00,044
What do they think of themselves?

968
01:35:01,168 --> 01:35:04,081
Are you trying to escape?

969
01:35:05,664 --> 01:35:08,202
l know that l'm not
permitted to use this bridge.

970
01:35:09,035 --> 01:35:10,742
But please let me go, or else. . .

971
01:35:10,743 --> 01:35:12,740
. . . my sister's marriage
will be cancelled.

972
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:15,194
lt's urgent and l have to go.

973
01:35:15,195 --> 01:35:18,109
lt's necessary for you to go but
not necessary for you to return.

974
01:35:18,359 --> 01:35:21,273
l swear on Billu,
l'll definitely return, Sir.

975
01:35:22,355 --> 01:35:26,934
You swear on Billu as
though he is your son.

976
01:35:27,684 --> 01:35:31,096
Sir, if he was my own l'd
perhaps make a false promise. . .

977
01:35:31,221 --> 01:35:34,301
. . . but l'll face a severe
punishment if l say a lie now.

978
01:35:35,009 --> 01:35:41,919
l'm touched by your words.

979
01:35:42,252 --> 01:35:45,039
l am weak at heart, isn't it?

980
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,245
- ls it very necessary for you to go?
- Yes, sir.

981
01:35:48,246 --> 01:35:52,117
Alright, you may go after
l turn to that side.

982
01:35:52,283 --> 01:35:55,280
lt's a crime if you
leave in my presence. Go!

983
01:35:56,071 --> 01:35:58,235
Thank you, sir!

984
01:35:58,236 --> 01:36:00,108
Hey! Listen to me atleast.

985
01:36:00,109 --> 01:36:02,106
Take care while you
talk to them, . . .

986
01:36:02,107 --> 01:36:05,104
. . . don't lose your cool, understand?

987
01:36:05,728 --> 01:36:08,934
Okay, go in a wink
and return in a wink too.

988
01:36:24,085 --> 01:36:27,165
Stop it, Mansukh.
Okay, we take your leave.

989
01:36:27,415 --> 01:36:32,826
We'll meet more often.

990
01:36:34,741 --> 01:36:38,070
You may proceed with
the arrangements.

991
01:36:38,071 --> 01:36:39,985
Okay, bye!

992
01:36:44,273 --> 01:36:46,188
Sir!

993
01:36:48,769 --> 01:36:53,014
- Who are you? - You may
treat me as Kamla's brother.

994
01:36:54,804 --> 01:36:56,843
What's the matter?

995
01:36:56,844 --> 01:36:59,466
Please don't heed to their
words and torment us.

996
01:36:59,467 --> 01:37:02,005
l'll fulfill the
promises made by Ramu.

997
01:37:03,296 --> 01:37:05,460
That's long forgotten.

998
01:37:05,461 --> 01:37:09,997
No sir, if you cancel the marriage,
we will be disgraced.

999
01:37:10,788 --> 01:37:13,203
You're being unfair to
both Kamla and your son.

1000
01:37:14,285 --> 01:37:18,198
l plead to you and beg of you,
please don't be so harsh.

1001
01:37:18,364 --> 01:37:22,027
- Stop it! - Please. . .
- Do you know. . .

1002
01:37:22,194 --> 01:37:24,191
. . . my son's marriage has been
fixed with a rich man's daughter. . .

1003
01:37:24,192 --> 01:37:26,189
. . . and they are willing
to pay Rs. 1 0,000 as dowry.

1004
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:29,186
Can you pay such a huge amount?

1005
01:37:29,187 --> 01:37:34,556
Why have you come here then?
You may go!

1006
01:37:38,178 --> 01:37:40,050
Listen!

1007
01:37:43,339 --> 01:37:45,835
Perhaps you didn't recognise me.

1008
01:37:45,836 --> 01:37:51,706
l'm Shekhar, please tell
Kamla that l'm helpless.

1009
01:37:53,163 --> 01:37:55,202
Ask her to forgive me if she can.

1010
01:38:03,194 --> 01:38:05,276
You scoundrel!
You coward!

1011
01:38:22,217 --> 01:38:24,465
Have you come?
What happened?

1012
01:38:25,214 --> 01:38:28,128
My foot! Who will seek alliance
with a cruel man like him?

1013
01:38:28,378 --> 01:38:30,458
l'll find a better
match for Kamla, . . .

1014
01:38:30,459 --> 01:38:32,540
. . . you too will be spell
bound when you see that.

1015
01:38:32,541 --> 01:38:35,079
You will never change.

1016
01:38:35,911 --> 01:38:37,950
Do you think a girl's
heart is like a wheel. . .

1017
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:40,449
. . . that can be
replaced with a stepny?

1018
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,279
They love each other
since their childhood.

1019
01:38:45,403 --> 01:38:47,566
What do you know of love?

1020
01:39:49,464 --> 01:39:52,377
''See. . .

1021
01:39:54,292 --> 01:39:56,332
''View a bioscope''

1022
01:39:58,953 --> 01:40:01,368
''View the Kutub Minar of Delhi''

1023
01:40:02,326 --> 01:40:05,322
''View the wonderful
sights of Mumbai''

1024
01:40:05,323 --> 01:40:08,195
''This is the Taj Mahal of Agra''

1025
01:40:08,361 --> 01:40:11,358
''You may view the whole world,
sitting at home''

1026
01:40:12,522 --> 01:40:17,352
''Spend money
and watch the show''

1027
01:40:37,664 --> 01:40:43,409
''Here l'm with my bioscope''

1028
01:40:50,361 --> 01:40:55,938
''Clap as the show
will come to an end''

1029
01:40:59,018 --> 01:41:03,430
Will you leave before
the show get's over?

1030
01:41:05,511 --> 01:41:08,549
Relax, uncle, l'll talk to her.

1031
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:10,923
Uncle wants to know why you've
put an end to the show. . .

1032
01:41:11,048 --> 01:41:13,336
. . . before it could begin?

1033
01:41:13,337 --> 01:41:18,415
No uncle, today's show
is about to begin now.

1034
01:41:20,081 --> 01:41:24,450
''Look at the cowardly groom''

1035
01:41:25,574 --> 01:41:27,446
''He failed to keep
up his promise. . .

1036
01:41:27,447 --> 01:41:29,444
. . . out of fear''

1037
01:41:29,445 --> 01:41:32,277
''Here and there,
below and above''

1038
01:41:33,566 --> 01:41:39,270
''Marriage is a trade
in their hands''

1039
01:41:39,727 --> 01:41:42,432
''They don't unite the lovers''

1040
01:41:42,599 --> 01:41:45,471
''Money is a barrier to this''

1041
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:51,465
''Spend money
and watch the show''

1042
01:42:23,642 --> 01:42:29,510
''A daughter is a puppet in
the hands of a poor father''

1043
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:41,540
''People expect gold and silver''

1044
01:42:44,621 --> 01:42:49,532
''The world is cruel''

1045
01:42:50,656 --> 01:42:55,526
''lt demands a huge sum
as dowry from a poor man''

1046
01:43:26,163 --> 01:43:28,702
Stop this nonsense
and get out of here.

1047
01:43:29,534 --> 01:43:31,782
l'll definitely go.

1048
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:37,776
You ldiot! Your father gained
Rs. 1 0,000, but what did you gain?

1049
01:43:38,525 --> 01:43:40,856
Why did you cheat your
childhood mate? Answer me!

1050
01:43:40,857 --> 01:43:43,104
Mind your tongue, Phoolmathi!

1051
01:43:43,687 --> 01:43:46,600
- You dancer!
- Your mother may be a dancer.

1052
01:43:46,851 --> 01:43:52,261
What did you say?
Don't you recognise me?

1053
01:43:52,511 --> 01:43:55,466
l'll drive you out of the village.

1054
01:43:55,675 --> 01:43:59,629
Say in chorus, 'Cockeyed man'

1055
01:44:00,753 --> 01:44:01,711
Shut up!

1056
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:12,573
- Who is that?
- l'm Shekhar.

1057
01:44:12,574 --> 01:44:14,781
What are you doing here?

1058
01:44:14,948 --> 01:44:16,736
- l've escaped from the
marriage hall. - On a cycle?

1059
01:44:16,737 --> 01:44:19,566
Yes, on a cycle!

1060
01:44:19,567 --> 01:44:22,606
l'm willing to marry Kamla,
immediately, if possible.

1061
01:44:23,563 --> 01:44:26,435
lf your parents refuse
to accept Kamla, then?

1062
01:44:26,727 --> 01:44:29,599
Don't worry about that,
it's my responsibility.

1063
01:44:30,556 --> 01:44:34,594
- Yes.
- Wait here.

1064
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:47,498
Kamla come with me.

1065
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:52,742
- Where. - Come with me.
- But listen to me.

1066
01:44:52,743 --> 01:44:55,657
- Look who's come.
- Shekhar! - Kamla!

1067
01:44:57,571 --> 01:44:59,735
ls this the time to romance?

1068
01:44:59,736 --> 01:45:04,896
You take Kamla to the temple.

1069
01:45:04,897 --> 01:45:08,685
l'm coming!
Oh God!

1070
01:45:10,308 --> 01:45:12,681
- You? What's the matter?
- Come to the temple at once.

1071
01:45:13,305 --> 01:45:15,720
You have to perform Kamla's
marriage with Shekhar.

1072
01:45:15,845 --> 01:45:17,966
Oh God!
l won't be party to this.

1073
01:45:17,967 --> 01:45:22,713
l rescued from the clutches of
the villagers the other day. . .

1074
01:45:22,837 --> 01:45:26,501
. . . but if l beat you now,
no one will come to your rescue.

1075
01:45:27,625 --> 01:45:31,828
- Come on! Don't waste time.
- l'm coming.

1076
01:45:56,679 --> 01:45:58,552
Priest!

1077
01:46:27,856 --> 01:46:29,894
You have plotted against me.

1078
01:46:29,895 --> 01:46:31,892
You have united with a criminal. . .

1079
01:46:31,893 --> 01:46:34,348
. . . and plotted to disgrace me
and my family.

1080
01:46:34,349 --> 01:46:36,763
Why do you blame that innocent man?

1081
01:46:37,013 --> 01:46:40,926
- Let whatever is happening happen.
- Shut up, l know all.

1082
01:46:42,008 --> 01:46:45,588
Why are you wasting time,
beat that criminal up.

1083
01:46:45,713 --> 01:46:51,082
And drag that useless fellow out.

1084
01:46:51,915 --> 01:46:53,954
You may beat me to death, but. . .

1085
01:46:53,955 --> 01:46:56,785
. . . l won't open the door
till the rituals are over.

1086
01:47:05,734 --> 01:47:08,940
Move! What are you up to?

1087
01:47:09,897 --> 01:47:15,099
What's all this, Surjit?

1088
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:17,764
A few noblemen tried to
disgrace a poor family.

1089
01:47:19,388 --> 01:47:21,802
l was only trying to
safeguard their honour.

1090
01:47:22,926 --> 01:47:25,839
But you have no
right to use force.

1091
01:47:26,922 --> 01:47:29,751
l want to talk to the
groom from Narayangaon.

1092
01:47:29,752 --> 01:47:35,163
Open the door.

1093
01:47:40,408 --> 01:47:42,822
lnspector!
l wasn't forced into anything.

1094
01:47:43,905 --> 01:47:46,734
l escaped from the
marriage hall willfully.

1095
01:47:46,735 --> 01:47:49,649
We married willfully too.

1096
01:47:50,065 --> 01:47:51,938
You Rascal!

1097
01:47:51,939 --> 01:47:56,683
lt's all over now.
You distribute sweets now.

1098
01:47:56,934 --> 01:47:59,014
You keep quiet!

1099
01:47:59,014 --> 01:48:01,012
Are you going away, Mr. Narayan.

1100
01:48:01,012 --> 01:48:03,885
What else can l do when my
own son has betrayed me?

1101
01:48:04,009 --> 01:48:05,883
Let's go!

1102
01:48:12,959 --> 01:48:15,873
Son!

1103
01:48:18,454 --> 01:48:21,991
Bless Kamla and Shekhar, father.

1104
01:48:28,984 --> 01:48:31,857
May you lead a happy
and prosperous life!

1105
01:48:32,856 --> 01:48:35,853
l troubled you, yet l'm
your mother, isn't it?

1106
01:48:36,019 --> 01:48:38,016
- Mother!
- My child!

1107
01:48:38,017 --> 01:48:40,723
Reap as you sow!
Don't worry son.

1108
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:44,052
l know your father very well.
He was coaxed to do. . .

1109
01:48:44,178 --> 01:48:46,841
. . . whatever he did.

1110
01:48:46,842 --> 01:48:50,713
lf your father isn't convinced yet,
you may come to my house. . .

1111
01:48:50,838 --> 01:48:53,001
. . . l have a lot of land.

1112
01:48:53,002 --> 01:48:56,040
We will toil together
and lead a respectable life.

1113
01:48:56,998 --> 01:49:01,910
Sister-in-law! Our enemy has
done the duties of your son.

1114
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:06,905
- Yes Durga!
- Son! Where are you?

1115
01:49:07,863 --> 01:49:10,776
- Mother!
- Son, did you shed your blood. . .

1116
01:49:10,901 --> 01:49:14,021
. . . for my daughter's sake?

1117
01:49:14,022 --> 01:49:17,935
Mother! This blood is
not valuable at all.

1118
01:49:19,851 --> 01:49:22,930
Mother! lf you would see
Kamla dressed as a bride. . .

1119
01:49:23,055 --> 01:49:25,177
. . . you too would
say the same thing.

1120
01:49:25,178 --> 01:49:27,093
Brother!

1121
01:50:21,081 --> 01:50:23,244
- Nayansukh!
- Yes Sir!

1122
01:50:23,245 --> 01:50:26,075
What do the crops live on?

1123
01:50:26,076 --> 01:50:28,490
- On water.
- On water?

1124
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:41,976
Put some mud on it. He used
to boast of his crops, isn't it?

1125
01:50:42,143 --> 01:50:47,513
Come on, put some mud.

1126
01:50:49,636 --> 01:50:51,965
Who has closed this tubewell?

1127
01:50:51,966 --> 01:50:54,172
- We have closed it.
- Why?

1128
01:50:54,339 --> 01:50:57,211
That's because the
water that flows. . .

1129
01:50:57,336 --> 01:51:00,208
. . . through this tubewell
comes from that pump.

1130
01:51:00,957 --> 01:51:03,121
And the pump belongs to our master.

1131
01:51:03,122 --> 01:51:06,036
Water is God's gift
and not anyone's property.

1132
01:51:06,951 --> 01:51:09,491
- Go and ask god for it then.
Bihari! - Yes.

1133
01:51:09,657 --> 01:51:12,529
You continue with your work.
And you remain here.

1134
01:51:12,945 --> 01:51:14,985
Okay Manager!
Hey, hurry up!

1135
01:51:15,651 --> 01:51:22,186
Dushman! Sarju is a very nice
man, you may plead to him.

1136
01:51:22,686 --> 01:51:27,306
l'll plead to God rather
than plead to that rogue.

1137
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:31,010
Reap as you sow!

1138
01:51:31,011 --> 01:51:34,549
Why are you talking of pleading
to someone, early in the morning?

1139
01:51:35,007 --> 01:51:37,004
Look at this injustice, Durga.

1140
01:51:37,005 --> 01:51:39,002
When that rascal Sarju
and his assistant. . .

1141
01:51:39,003 --> 01:51:41,000
. . . failed to conquer me. . .

1142
01:51:41,001 --> 01:51:42,707
. . . they have taken
it's toll on my crops.

1143
01:51:42,708 --> 01:51:44,996
They have refused to
supply water to my fields.

1144
01:51:44,997 --> 01:51:47,536
Obviously, they had to do that.

1145
01:51:48,035 --> 01:51:50,907
You have foiled their
plans after all.

1146
01:51:52,031 --> 01:51:55,069
He seized everyone's land.

1147
01:51:56,694 --> 01:51:59,107
Only Ramu's land was
left to be seized, . . .

1148
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:01,688
. . . and you didn't let
that happen, isn't it?

1149
01:52:01,689 --> 01:52:04,102
Durga! But Sarju
didn't seize our land.

1150
01:52:05,184 --> 01:52:07,181
We have only mortgaged it to him.

1151
01:52:07,182 --> 01:52:10,178
You dream of retrieving
your land till you die.

1152
01:52:10,179 --> 01:52:12,051
When l went to court yesterday. . .

1153
01:52:12,052 --> 01:52:16,006
. . . l learnt that
he has registered. . .

1154
01:52:16,007 --> 01:52:18,170
. . . all the documents in his name.

1155
01:52:18,171 --> 01:52:22,959
What are you saying?
ln that case we'll die.

1156
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:26,122
Why should you die!
lt's a cruel world.

1157
01:52:26,247 --> 01:52:28,285
Come along with me,
we'll break his bones.

1158
01:52:28,286 --> 01:52:34,114
Brother! You reap as you sow.
Violence is no solution to this.

1159
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:37,111
l advice that we should go
and meet the Collector. . .

1160
01:52:37,277 --> 01:52:40,108
. . . who is staying in the
Government guest house.

1161
01:52:41,065 --> 01:52:44,604
- What will we tell him?
- l'll talk to him.

1162
01:52:45,228 --> 01:52:48,057
You gather all the villagers,
we will go together.

1163
01:52:48,058 --> 01:52:52,304
- You too accompany us.
- Well said!

1164
01:52:52,762 --> 01:52:55,176
Reap as you sow!

1165
01:52:56,092 --> 01:53:01,045
'Circuit House'

1166
01:53:05,083 --> 01:53:07,164
Stop!
Let him in.

1167
01:53:17,737 --> 01:53:20,234
Sir!
You and here!?

1168
01:53:20,235 --> 01:53:23,105
l too can ask you
the same question.

1169
01:53:23,106 --> 01:53:25,647
- What's the matter?
- Sir! My villagers. . .

1170
01:53:25,812 --> 01:53:31,182
. . . want to make a request to you.

1171
01:53:31,432 --> 01:53:34,387
- Your villagers!?
- Yes Sir!

1172
01:53:35,136 --> 01:53:38,175
You made me the scape goat for
the sake of one innocent man. . .

1173
01:53:38,342 --> 01:53:40,796
- . . . but today. . .
- Talk with respect!

1174
01:53:40,797 --> 01:53:43,003
Pardon me, Actually. . .

1175
01:53:43,170 --> 01:53:46,042
. . . the villagers are
facing a difficulty.

1176
01:53:47,124 --> 01:53:50,330
What sort of difficulty?

1177
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:56,157
Sir, that rascal Sarju. . .
Pardon me, it's an old habit.

1178
01:53:57,156 --> 01:54:00,445
Sarju is tormenting
the poor farmers.

1179
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:03,442
And this injustice shouldn't be
tolerated, in your presence.

1180
01:54:05,356 --> 01:54:08,228
lnjustice! Tell me.

1181
01:54:09,186 --> 01:54:11,349
- What's the matter?
- l can't tell you the facts. . .

1182
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:13,347
. . . Durga will tell you about it.

1183
01:54:13,348 --> 01:54:17,219
Durga! Tell him about
your grievances.

1184
01:54:27,168 --> 01:54:31,038
lt's you.
Whom are you searching for?

1185
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:34,202
Whom should l search for?
l was wondering. . .

1186
01:54:34,369 --> 01:54:37,283
. . . where all the men
folk have disappeared.

1187
01:54:38,323 --> 01:54:40,529
They have been visiting
the court often, isn't it?

1188
01:54:40,530 --> 01:54:42,569
- Can l ask you something?
- Yes.

1189
01:54:42,570 --> 01:54:45,442
Are you interested in all
of them or only one of them?

1190
01:54:47,189 --> 01:54:49,438
You are a crook.
l'm not interested in anyone.

1191
01:54:50,852 --> 01:54:56,097
He is an impolite man.
He never talks with respect.

1192
01:54:56,347 --> 01:54:59,510
He is always impolite.

1193
01:54:59,511 --> 01:55:03,424
But all his friends. . .

1194
01:55:04,214 --> 01:55:06,211
. . . are impolite.

1195
01:55:06,212 --> 01:55:09,251
lf you are interested in him you
too speak in the same manner.

1196
01:55:09,543 --> 01:55:14,953
There ends the matter.

1197
01:55:25,235 --> 01:55:28,273
- You rascal! - How dare you
call me rascal, you rascal?

1198
01:55:29,231 --> 01:55:31,269
You pose to be the
village chieftain. . .

1199
01:55:31,270 --> 01:55:33,435
. . . what's the matter you're
not to be seen these days?

1200
01:55:34,226 --> 01:55:36,432
You're not aware of anything.
l'll modify the village. . .

1201
01:55:36,598 --> 01:55:39,429
. . . to such an extent that
everyone will be spellbound.

1202
01:55:40,261 --> 01:55:42,258
The village will
have a projector. . .

1203
01:55:42,259 --> 01:55:45,257
. . . and your bioscope will
be discarded, understand?

1204
01:55:45,588 --> 01:55:49,169
How dare you ridicule me?
lf you dare to do that again. . .

1205
01:55:49,294 --> 01:55:52,166
. . . l'll break your bones, understand?

1206
01:55:52,416 --> 01:55:56,329
- l've seen a projector.
- Where have you seen a it?

1207
01:55:56,577 --> 01:55:59,159
The Collector brings it
to our village, often.

1208
01:55:59,409 --> 01:56:02,156
What does it show?
lt features a man and a woman. . .

1209
01:56:02,281 --> 01:56:05,153
. . . and a doctor intervenes
and asks them. . .

1210
01:56:05,278 --> 01:56:07,485
. . . to control the population.
That's all.

1211
01:56:09,441 --> 01:56:12,313
Oh that!
That's government publicity.

1212
01:56:12,438 --> 01:56:14,934
You'll go mad if you
see the real bioscope.

1213
01:56:14,935 --> 01:56:17,391
Don't act smart.
Okay, tell me. . .

1214
01:56:17,515 --> 01:56:19,637
. . . what does your
bioscope feature?

1215
01:56:19,638 --> 01:56:23,301
lt has many features.
Sit, l'll tell you about it.

1216
01:56:23,302 --> 01:56:25,342
l got trapped unnecessarily. . .

1217
01:56:25,507 --> 01:56:27,962
. . . or else, l used to watch
a movie every other day.

1218
01:56:27,963 --> 01:56:30,170
They show romantic movies there.

1219
01:56:31,294 --> 01:56:33,334
The hero would enter
and people would whistle.

1220
01:56:37,455 --> 01:56:39,493
l watched an English movie once,
and l saw that. . .

1221
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:43,530
. . . the hero called the heroine
darling and kissed her too.

1222
01:56:44,323 --> 01:56:46,610
Oh God! You shameless man!

1223
01:56:46,611 --> 01:56:48,359
You don't have any manners.

1224
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:53,021
Don't you know how you should
talk to an unmarried girl?

1225
01:56:53,022 --> 01:56:55,228
To hell with you
and your bioscope.

1226
01:56:58,515 --> 01:57:02,346
Uncle!

1227
01:57:03,012 --> 01:57:07,216
The old man has gone away
leaving the doors open.

1228
01:57:09,339 --> 01:57:11,379
He must have gone
to an arrack shop.

1229
01:57:14,334 --> 01:57:19,371
l'll teach him a
lesson when he comes.

1230
01:57:28,527 --> 01:57:32,399
You've come home very early,
my dear Phoolmathi.

1231
01:57:33,023 --> 01:57:35,062
What else should l do?
Nobody will watch. . .

1232
01:57:35,063 --> 01:57:38,017
. . . your old bioscope henceforth.

1233
01:57:38,018 --> 01:57:40,267
You show only songs
and the Taj Mahal of Delhi. . .

1234
01:57:40,391 --> 01:57:43,511
. . . and the Kutub Minar of Mumbai.

1235
01:57:43,512 --> 01:57:47,425
My dear, you seem to
be very angry today.

1236
01:57:47,675 --> 01:57:51,629
Don't enrage me further.
You may watch the stuff yourself.

1237
01:57:52,337 --> 01:57:54,418
No one is interested
in your songs either.

1238
01:57:56,042 --> 01:57:58,580
Everyone is interested
in that song. . .

1239
01:58:01,079 --> 01:58:05,283
- Which song?
- The one that's played in theatres.

1240
01:58:06,406 --> 01:58:09,279
Oh! l understand.

1241
01:58:10,070 --> 01:58:16,272
Tell me, my dear, whom do you
want to sing this song to?

1242
01:58:17,395 --> 01:58:22,057
To that prisoner?

1243
01:58:22,058 --> 01:58:25,595
- You are a fool.
- ls that so?

1244
01:58:25,762 --> 01:58:29,675
Does a girl assess a man
when she falls in love?

1245
01:58:33,587 --> 01:58:36,583
You naughty fellow!

1246
01:58:36,584 --> 01:58:39,498
l'm right. l neither have
a house nor a destination.

1247
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:42,995
So what?
l have a home, isn't it?

1248
01:58:45,408 --> 01:58:47,447
l too need a partner.

1249
01:58:47,448 --> 01:58:50,487
That old Nana is a drunkard
and he may die any day.

1250
01:58:50,737 --> 01:58:55,482
- What did you say?
- l mean he will expire.

1251
01:58:57,772 --> 01:58:59,894
He is so addicted to liquor that. . .

1252
01:58:59,895 --> 01:59:02,767
. . . he forgets everything
else when he sees the bottle.

1253
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:08,677
The opposite happened with me.
People forget the world. . .

1254
01:59:08,844 --> 01:59:11,716
. . . when they drink, but l gave
up wine when l gained everything.

1255
01:59:13,132 --> 01:59:18,334
l have got my parents, a sister
and two innocent nephews.

1256
01:59:20,457 --> 01:59:23,370
But. . . my sister-in-law
hasn't forgiven me.

1257
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:27,449
Perhaps she will never forgive me.

1258
01:59:27,450 --> 01:59:30,489
When l leave the village l'll
leave with a heavy heart.

1259
01:59:34,152 --> 01:59:38,522
- Will you leave the village?
- This village is a jail to me.

1260
01:59:39,646 --> 01:59:42,351
l'll have to go after
serving my term here.

1261
01:59:42,685 --> 01:59:48,554
- After that? - The same old
life and the same old truck.

1262
01:59:48,679 --> 01:59:51,176
And the same old journey.

1263
01:59:51,177 --> 01:59:53,506
Passing by the same
old lanes and villages.

1264
01:59:53,507 --> 01:59:56,379
The same old bottle of alcohol
and spending the night. . .

1265
01:59:56,504 --> 01:59:59,376
. . . with the same old whore.
You rascal!

1266
02:00:01,499 --> 02:00:03,205
What's happened to
you all of a sudden?

1267
02:00:03,206 --> 02:00:05,370
Have l offended you in any way?

1268
02:00:05,829 --> 02:00:07,577
You cheat!

1269
02:00:07,744 --> 02:00:10,531
All my efforts have been in vain.

1270
02:00:10,532 --> 02:00:12,572
You called me a fool, isn't it?

1271
02:00:12,739 --> 02:00:15,693
lt takes time to reform
oneself, isn't it?

1272
02:00:15,694 --> 02:00:18,607
Brother!
Stop ! Brother!

1273
02:00:20,522 --> 02:00:24,435
Kamla! Shekhar!

1274
02:00:26,183 --> 02:00:28,098
Brother!

1275
02:00:29,513 --> 02:00:32,593
- Sister! l was going to
visit my sister-in-law. . .

1276
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:35,590
. . . so l thought l'd meet
you on my way, as well.

1277
02:00:36,881 --> 02:00:40,752
You look lovely! People may
cast an evil eye on you.

1278
02:00:47,745 --> 02:00:50,617
Brother! What is that
dancer doing here?

1279
02:00:51,574 --> 02:00:56,444
- Oh she!?
- Do you call her a dancer?

1280
02:00:56,611 --> 02:00:59,109
But it was she who made
me realise my folly.

1281
02:00:59,566 --> 02:01:03,771
Her show helped you realise
and my brother's slap. . .

1282
02:01:07,558 --> 02:01:10,430
Brother! What have
you done to yourself?

1283
02:01:11,554 --> 02:01:13,594
- l'm perfectly alright.
- Look at your clothes.

1284
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:20,172
Okay, wait.

1285
02:01:23,751 --> 02:01:28,829
See what l have brought for you.

1286
02:01:31,576 --> 02:01:36,988
ls it for me?

1287
02:01:37,570 --> 02:01:41,232
ls it for me?

1288
02:01:41,233 --> 02:01:44,688
What are you doing?
Take off your shirt first.

1289
02:01:46,269 --> 02:01:48,767
My shirt is torn.

1290
02:01:48,768 --> 02:01:53,679
Mother and father miss you.
Let's go home.

1291
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:59,838
Move, my sister has come
for the first time. . .

1292
02:01:59,839 --> 02:02:05,209
. . . after marriage,
so l'll pull the cart.

1293
02:02:10,621 --> 02:02:14,658
- Father! - What's the matter?
- See who's come.

1294
02:02:15,282 --> 02:02:17,779
- Who has come?
- Kamla.

1295
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:20,694
- Has Kamla come?
- Mother, Kamla has come.

1296
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:25,564
- Where is she? - See she has
brought a Kurta for me too.

1297
02:02:25,689 --> 02:02:31,183
l'll wear it and roam
around the whole village.

1298
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,720
Okay, you wait here,
l'll come in a while.

1299
02:02:40,549 --> 02:02:43,046
Billu, how are you?

1300
02:02:44,545 --> 02:02:46,167
Sister-in-law.

1301
02:02:46,168 --> 02:02:49,831
Come, Kamla.
Bless you. Come in.

1302
02:02:50,539 --> 02:02:51,455
Sit.

1303
02:02:52,537 --> 02:02:57,115
You know how l miss you?
Go.

1304
02:02:57,574 --> 02:03:02,985
Sister-in-law, this is for Lallu.

1305
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:06,065
Kamla, is everything fine
in your in-law's house.

1306
02:03:06,981 --> 02:03:08,978
Yes, Sister-in-law.
Everything is fine.

1307
02:03:08,979 --> 02:03:12,182
Now everybody loves me a lot.

1308
02:03:12,183 --> 02:03:15,139
This time we had a good crop.

1309
02:03:15,389 --> 02:03:18,094
- l wish . . .
- Forget that.

1310
02:03:18,094 --> 02:03:20,633
You tell me about yourself.

1311
02:03:20,634 --> 02:03:25,087
Sister-in-law, will
you never forgive him?

1312
02:03:28,459 --> 02:03:31,622
You all are very
kindhearted, Kamla.

1313
02:03:31,623 --> 02:03:35,035
But how can l forgive him?

1314
02:03:35,036 --> 02:03:38,240
Because of whom you got married.

1315
02:03:38,241 --> 02:03:41,530
How can l forget that l
become a widow because of him?

1316
02:03:43,028 --> 02:03:46,525
Forgive me, Sister-in-law.

1317
02:03:47,607 --> 02:03:50,812
But tell me, why do you need
so much money all of a sudden?

1318
02:03:51,436 --> 02:03:54,308
lnspector, didn't you
see this shirt is new?

1319
02:03:55,016 --> 02:03:56,597
l can see that.

1320
02:03:56,598 --> 02:03:59,260
But what's the matter?

1321
02:03:59,261 --> 02:04:01,301
My sister has brought
this shirt for me.

1322
02:04:01,634 --> 02:04:04,048
She has brought some
thing for everyone.

1323
02:04:04,048 --> 02:04:05,837
Even l should give something.

1324
02:04:05,838 --> 02:04:07,627
l couldn't give anything
in her marriage.

1325
02:04:07,628 --> 02:04:09,708
For the first time after marriage,
she has come . . .

1326
02:04:09,709 --> 02:04:11,665
. . . to her mother's house.
She will go after some time.

1327
02:04:11,666 --> 02:04:15,161
lf l don't give her
something this time . . .

1328
02:04:15,162 --> 02:04:17,326
- Shall l call Headsahab?
- No.

1329
02:04:17,327 --> 02:04:18,243
Come here.

1330
02:04:22,072 --> 02:04:24,652
Take this Rs. 50.

1331
02:04:24,653 --> 02:04:27,566
lf this is more than l'm share . . .

1332
02:04:28,066 --> 02:04:29,647
Repay it after selling the crop.

1333
02:04:29,648 --> 02:04:33,852
- Yes.
- Now you leave or they may go.

1334
02:04:34,060 --> 02:04:36,141
lnspector, l'm very
grateful to you.

1335
02:04:53,707 --> 02:04:56,870
Brother, where were you?

1336
02:04:56,871 --> 02:04:58,701
We were waiting for
you since so long.

1337
02:04:58,702 --> 02:05:02,907
- How do l look, Kamla?
- Very nice. - lsn't it?

1338
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:06,153
- But where were you, brother?
- Don't ask that.

1339
02:05:06,694 --> 02:05:09,149
Look Kamla, l'm your poor brother.

1340
02:05:09,150 --> 02:05:11,147
l couldn't give you
anything during marriage.

1341
02:05:11,148 --> 02:05:13,395
Today you've come with your
husband for the first time.

1342
02:05:13,396 --> 02:05:15,726
How could l send you empty handed?

1343
02:05:15,727 --> 02:05:18,266
Look, what l have brought for you?

1344
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:25,716
- Brother!
- Shekhar, this is for you.

1345
02:05:25,717 --> 02:05:27,756
And tell your father that
we will sell the crop . . .

1346
02:05:27,757 --> 02:05:30,171
. . . and fulfill the
promise we had made.

1347
02:05:31,128 --> 02:05:32,002
Brother!

1348
02:05:34,708 --> 02:05:36,372
What are you doing?

1349
02:05:36,373 --> 02:05:38,953
Go, it's getting late.

1350
02:05:40,993 --> 02:05:41,909
Go.

1351
02:05:55,437 --> 02:05:57,976
You missed this aim too, Mr. Sirju.

1352
02:05:58,143 --> 02:06:03,595
Yes, Moolchand.
Nowadays l'm missing my aim.

1353
02:06:06,759 --> 02:06:07,633
Sir!

1354
02:06:13,585 --> 02:06:16,457
The city's greatest lawyer
will defend the villagers.

1355
02:06:17,165 --> 02:06:19,621
l don't understand
who is behind this.

1356
02:06:20,787 --> 02:06:23,701
Nainsukh, let me enjoy
peacefully at least sometimes.

1357
02:06:25,782 --> 02:06:28,487
Whenever you come,
you come with a bad news.

1358
02:06:29,278 --> 02:06:31,984
Only if you feel bad
hearing the bad news.

1359
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,689
The Magistrate has ordered
that the villagers can keep . . .

1360
02:06:35,814 --> 02:06:37,769
. . . this year's crop.

1361
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:40,933
You are unaware. And all the
villagers are celebrating.

1362
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:43,222
Tomorrow morning the
crop will be harvested.

1363
02:06:43,223 --> 02:06:47,801
Who has seen tomorrow?

1364
02:06:47,802 --> 02:06:50,839
l wish to see.

1365
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:52,504
Why this aim towards me?

1366
02:06:52,505 --> 02:06:54,711
We've missed all our aims.

1367
02:06:55,418 --> 02:06:58,831
l wonder from where
that murder come.

1368
02:06:58,832 --> 02:07:02,204
He had come as a prisoner,
he will leave as an honourable man.

1369
02:07:49,864 --> 02:07:52,570
' l saw, You saw'

1370
02:07:55,858 --> 02:07:58,772
'He saw, she saw Everyone saw'

1371
02:08:04,891 --> 02:08:07,387
'What did you see'

1372
02:08:07,388 --> 02:08:11,759
'A foe who is more
dear than friends'

1373
02:08:30,948 --> 02:08:35,360
'A village which is
unique than the cities'

1374
02:09:09,618 --> 02:09:12,657
'Today we will punish you'

1375
02:09:13,364 --> 02:09:16,277
'For all your mistakes'

1376
02:09:24,936 --> 02:09:31,845
'We will put this garland of
flowers around your neck'

1377
02:09:32,637 --> 02:09:35,217
'This is the custom
of this village'

1378
02:09:35,966 --> 02:09:39,171
'This is the music of life'

1379
02:09:40,003 --> 02:09:43,042
'This is the song of the day'

1380
02:09:57,985 --> 02:10:02,482
'A moon which the apple
of everyone's eye'

1381
02:10:42,233 --> 02:10:45,564
' More strong than
the shackles are . . .

1382
02:10:46,021 --> 02:10:48,768
'. . . the delicate bonds of love'

1383
02:10:58,050 --> 02:11:04,462
'How can the prisoner escape
breaking these delicate bonds'

1384
02:11:05,043 --> 02:11:08,124
'You brought happiness'

1385
02:11:08,665 --> 02:11:11,911
'You are the gardener
of these gardens'

1386
02:11:12,537 --> 02:11:15,907
'You are the farmer
of these fields'

1387
02:11:30,477 --> 02:11:34,972
'A prisoner who is our guard'

1388
02:12:24,131 --> 02:12:27,379
'Everybody forgave me But. . . '

1389
02:12:27,835 --> 02:12:30,874
'. . . the one whose sinner l am'

1390
02:12:39,657 --> 02:12:46,443
'When will her silence break'

1391
02:12:46,816 --> 02:12:49,855
' l'll be glad if she
also forgives me'

1392
02:12:50,147 --> 02:12:53,851
' l'll be glad if she
clears all the hatred'

1393
02:12:54,767 --> 02:12:57,722
' l'll be glad if she does justice'

1394
02:13:00,719 --> 02:13:03,758
'Not mine, . . . not yours'

1395
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:09,710
'Not his, nor hers, No one's. . . .'

1396
02:13:10,211 --> 02:13:13,498
'This is the fault of the fate'

1397
02:13:19,575 --> 02:13:25,070
Fire has opened in the fields!

1398
02:13:32,230 --> 02:13:33,146
My fields!

1399
02:13:51,626 --> 02:13:52,917
Leave me!

1400
02:13:57,662 --> 02:14:00,119
My fields!

1401
02:14:00,659 --> 02:14:02,741
Leave me!
Let me go.

1402
02:14:44,283 --> 02:14:46,780
l regret, Surjeet,
l cannot do anything.

1403
02:14:48,113 --> 02:14:51,858
Law can surely do justice.
But it is blind too.

1404
02:14:52,109 --> 02:14:54,190
Why don't you understand?
That without proof . . .

1405
02:14:54,314 --> 02:14:56,561
. . . l cannot take any
action against Sirju.

1406
02:14:56,728 --> 02:14:59,267
Then what else can your law do?

1407
02:14:59,268 --> 02:15:00,723
lt can only punish me?

1408
02:15:00,724 --> 02:15:02,305
But that beast who
turned the crop . . .

1409
02:15:02,306 --> 02:15:04,303
. . . of several poor
people into ashes, . . .

1410
02:15:04,304 --> 02:15:07,716
. . . you can't do
anything against him?

1411
02:15:07,717 --> 02:15:10,506
Alright, inspector.
You are helpless.

1412
02:15:11,339 --> 02:15:15,876
Your law is helpless.
But l can do a lot.

1413
02:15:18,915 --> 02:15:24,201
Don't forget that
you are a prisoner.

1414
02:15:24,784 --> 02:15:29,030
A person always take
a wrong step in anger.

1415
02:15:30,903 --> 02:15:34,690
l promise you that l'll strictly
investigate about this matter.

1416
02:15:35,689 --> 02:15:40,060
Now you go.

1417
02:15:45,346 --> 02:15:48,634
Last night a catastrophe
occurred in the village.

1418
02:15:48,635 --> 02:15:50,757
Several fields turned to ashes.

1419
02:15:50,758 --> 02:15:53,463
- Fields got burned? - Yes.
Forget it. We are not concerned.

1420
02:15:54,378 --> 02:15:57,374
l was told that the villagers
were going to take the crop home.

1421
02:15:57,375 --> 02:15:59,372
Anyway. What did you do about
something l had told you?

1422
02:15:59,373 --> 02:16:01,039
l have done it.
Birju has come.

1423
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:03,368
Birju, come.

1424
02:16:03,369 --> 02:16:06,365
Greetings, sir.

1425
02:16:06,366 --> 02:16:08,363
l'm seeing you after many days.

1426
02:16:08,364 --> 02:16:11,653
ln childhood, l used to watch
your tricks and hear your songs.

1427
02:16:13,359 --> 02:16:15,773
Now l have become old.

1428
02:16:15,774 --> 02:16:17,771
l'm waiting for my death.

1429
02:16:17,772 --> 02:16:20,020
l have only one
responsibility Phoolmati.

1430
02:16:20,021 --> 02:16:23,516
l've got a nice groom for her.

1431
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:27,054
And they get along well too.

1432
02:16:27,055 --> 02:16:29,302
Once l get both of them married . . .

1433
02:16:30,801 --> 02:16:34,379
What's the matter?

1434
02:16:34,380 --> 02:16:37,376
- ls it imported?
- Yes.

1435
02:16:37,377 --> 02:16:40,250
We poor are not destined for this.

1436
02:16:40,416 --> 02:16:43,412
What are you saying?
Let's drink now if you say.

1437
02:16:43,413 --> 02:16:45,453
Nainsukh, take Birju in the room.

1438
02:16:45,661 --> 02:16:47,825
And send a servant
to take the things.

1439
02:16:47,826 --> 02:16:53,112
Sir, l'll take it.
lt is imported.

1440
02:17:03,435 --> 02:17:08,596
Take, eat it.

1441
02:17:10,803 --> 02:17:13,799
l had cultivated this
crop with great hopes.

1442
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:16,588
l thought after l
leave the village, . . .

1443
02:17:17,462 --> 02:17:19,794
. . . the children will at
least get two times meals.

1444
02:17:20,835 --> 02:17:23,455
Everything turned to ashes.

1445
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:27,036
So what?
Everything will be alright again.

1446
02:17:27,828 --> 02:17:30,074
You still have the strength.

1447
02:17:30,075 --> 02:17:32,156
Yes, but l've lost courage.

1448
02:17:35,861 --> 02:17:38,440
How will all this happen?

1449
02:17:38,441 --> 02:17:40,438
From where will l
get so much money?

1450
02:17:40,439 --> 02:17:42,436
l'll give you.

1451
02:17:42,437 --> 02:17:43,353
You?

1452
02:17:45,060 --> 02:17:47,141
Why? Can't l share your sorrow?

1453
02:17:47,849 --> 02:17:49,471
l had saved the money
for the wedding . . .

1454
02:17:49,472 --> 02:17:53,051
Whose wedding?

1455
02:17:53,052 --> 02:17:54,717
You witch!

1456
02:17:55,466 --> 02:17:59,754
You were romancing
when l was not at home.

1457
02:18:00,128 --> 02:18:02,500
And that too with this scoundrel!

1458
02:18:02,501 --> 02:18:04,498
What nonsense are you talking?
Come in your senses.

1459
02:18:04,499 --> 02:18:07,788
Forget it, Phoolmati.
Your grandpa is drunk.

1460
02:18:08,994 --> 02:18:13,489
Grandpa, why are you using
abusive words? Go and sleep.

1461
02:18:13,490 --> 02:18:16,486
- Yes, Grandpa.
- You move aside.

1462
02:18:16,487 --> 02:18:21,190
lf you talk too much,
l'll beat you with a shoe.

1463
02:18:22,023 --> 02:18:25,894
Grandpa, you walk barefoot.
First buy a pair of shoes.

1464
02:18:26,185 --> 02:18:29,641
What did you say?
You are making fun of me?

1465
02:18:30,140 --> 02:18:31,929
Seeing you, l feel
ashamed of myself that . . .

1466
02:18:31,930 --> 02:18:34,385
- . . . even l was a drunkard
once upon a time. - Keep quiet.

1467
02:18:35,718 --> 02:18:39,048
You try to teach me
coming in my house?

1468
02:18:39,547 --> 02:18:41,544
- You bastard!
- Grandpa!

1469
02:18:41,545 --> 02:18:45,208
Listen to me.
l'll break your head.

1470
02:18:45,916 --> 02:18:48,205
l won't spare you alive.

1471
02:18:49,537 --> 02:18:53,908
Move aside!

1472
02:18:53,908 --> 02:18:56,197
You call me a bastard?
You scoundrel!

1473
02:19:02,524 --> 02:19:04,521
- Where are you going?
- Leave me!

1474
02:19:04,522 --> 02:19:06,519
Pour water on him, he will
come back to his senses.

1475
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:08,768
Had he not been your grandpa,
l would have killed him.

1476
02:19:08,893 --> 02:19:11,474
- Don't touch me.
- Please listen!

1477
02:19:13,555 --> 02:19:15,052
You shameless drunkard!

1478
02:19:15,053 --> 02:19:17,842
He was hungry since night.
l had brought him to eat food.

1479
02:19:18,009 --> 02:19:22,629
You didn't even let him eat.

1480
02:19:22,713 --> 02:19:24,710
What are you saying,
daughter-in-law?

1481
02:19:24,711 --> 02:19:26,541
lt's a fact.

1482
02:19:26,542 --> 02:19:30,246
One day, as whose bride l
had come in this house, . . .

1483
02:19:30,538 --> 02:19:32,994
. . . his memories
are being wiped off.

1484
02:19:33,577 --> 02:19:35,740
But today l won't keep quiet.

1485
02:19:35,741 --> 02:19:37,572
Even l have a right on this house.

1486
02:19:37,573 --> 02:19:40,486
Where ever that jinxed's
shadow falls, . . .

1487
02:19:40,653 --> 02:19:42,608
. . . everything will turn to ashes.

1488
02:19:42,609 --> 02:19:46,147
Like our fields, even our house
and my children turn to ashes.

1489
02:19:46,313 --> 02:19:49,019
No! Don't talk like
that, sister-in-law.

1490
02:19:50,851 --> 02:19:53,180
Sister-in-law!

1491
02:19:53,181 --> 02:19:55,096
You call me sister-in-law?

1492
02:19:55,096 --> 02:19:58,135
Aren't you satisfied
making me a widow?

1493
02:19:58,593 --> 02:20:00,298
That you want to make me
partaker of your sin. . .

1494
02:20:00,299 --> 02:20:02,130
. . . by making this relationship?

1495
02:20:02,131 --> 02:20:03,629
Go away from here!

1496
02:20:03,630 --> 02:20:06,085
lf you don't go, l will leave
this house with my children.

1497
02:20:07,792 --> 02:20:09,957
What are you saying? You are the
daughter-in-law of this house.

1498
02:20:10,289 --> 02:20:12,620
Your children are the
heirs of this house.

1499
02:20:12,621 --> 02:20:15,034
You don't need to
go because of me.

1500
02:20:15,035 --> 02:20:17,449
l will atone for my sin alone.

1501
02:20:20,238 --> 02:20:22,027
You are right.

1502
02:20:22,028 --> 02:20:24,108
l am jinxed.

1503
02:20:24,109 --> 02:20:26,897
Love, affection,
bonds are not for me.

1504
02:20:26,898 --> 02:20:29,270
l will not let my ill-omened
shadow fall on these children.

1505
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:32,101
Never.

1506
02:20:52,122 --> 02:20:55,577
Please forgive me.

1507
02:20:57,659 --> 02:20:59,281
l made a mistake.

1508
02:20:59,282 --> 02:21:01,947
Since yesterday even Phoolmati
is not talking to me.

1509
02:21:03,153 --> 02:21:06,816
l won't go back home if
you don't forgive me.

1510
02:21:07,358 --> 02:21:08,647
Forget it, grandpa.

1511
02:21:08,648 --> 02:21:11,145
Every drunkard behaves like
this after the hangover.

1512
02:21:11,354 --> 02:21:13,226
No. You don't know.

1513
02:21:13,227 --> 02:21:17,555
That scoundrel Sirju made me
drink and quarrel with you.

1514
02:21:18,055 --> 02:21:18,888
Yes.

1515
02:21:20,136 --> 02:21:23,258
- Did you forgive me now?
- Yes, grandpa. Go home.

1516
02:21:24,049 --> 02:21:25,713
Not like this.

1517
02:21:25,714 --> 02:21:27,837
l made you get up from the
dinner table yesterday.

1518
02:21:28,295 --> 02:21:31,250
l will agree only when you
have dinner with me tonight.

1519
02:21:33,207 --> 02:21:37,244
- Will you come? Tell me.
- Yes, l will come.

1520
02:21:37,702 --> 02:21:39,782
'- Then what happened
- O' God!'

1521
02:21:39,783 --> 02:21:44,778
' My earring fell off in our love'

1522
02:21:50,522 --> 02:21:52,854
l'll get you another pair.

1523
02:21:57,349 --> 02:22:01,679
Go and search of your earring.

1524
02:22:03,135 --> 02:22:05,715
Mr.Sirju, you are great!

1525
02:22:05,716 --> 02:22:08,337
l always see the same old face.

1526
02:22:08,338 --> 02:22:10,501
Don't you have any new beauty?

1527
02:22:10,502 --> 02:22:13,875
Why not?
Just order me.

1528
02:22:14,332 --> 02:22:17,162
You just talk.

1529
02:22:17,163 --> 02:22:19,743
You are making me
spend so much money.

1530
02:22:19,744 --> 02:22:21,741
And the farm is not yet build.

1531
02:22:21,742 --> 02:22:25,029
How long will bluff the lncome Tax?

1532
02:22:25,238 --> 02:22:27,735
All my earning comes
from the farming.

1533
02:22:27,736 --> 02:22:30,441
lf my secret is revealed,
l'll be in jail . . .

1534
02:22:30,774 --> 02:22:33,937
. . . and enjoy yourself outside.
Understand?

1535
02:22:34,146 --> 02:22:38,641
- Master!
- Look, master's stooge is here.

1536
02:22:42,762 --> 02:22:44,926
- Master, there's a good news.
- What is it?

1537
02:22:45,135 --> 02:22:48,173
- Malati drove that murderer
out of the house. - ls it?

1538
02:22:48,756 --> 02:22:52,253
But that scoundrel Durgaprasad
kept him in his house.

1539
02:22:54,792 --> 02:22:58,454
Never mind.
We can deal with him later.

1540
02:22:58,788 --> 02:23:01,201
He won't go anywhere
leaving the village.

1541
02:23:01,202 --> 02:23:03,366
But that scoundrel!

1542
02:23:05,281 --> 02:23:07,654
Nainsukh, our Mr. Moolchand . . .

1543
02:23:08,403 --> 02:23:10,693
. . . is very bored of this girl.

1544
02:23:11,775 --> 02:23:16,687
l was thinking that . . . . What
do you think about Phoolmati?

1545
02:23:17,186 --> 02:23:18,767
- What?
- Yes.

1546
02:23:18,768 --> 02:23:20,807
You said that the prisoner
is going to marry him. . .

1547
02:23:20,808 --> 02:23:23,096
. . . and become the
son-in-law of the village.

1548
02:23:23,097 --> 02:23:25,469
lt's a very good idea.

1549
02:23:25,803 --> 02:23:30,838
lf you say, l'll make
all the arrangement.

1550
02:23:30,839 --> 02:23:34,710
lf we throw some money,
Phoolmati will be here.

1551
02:23:37,832 --> 02:23:41,827
What's bad in it?

1552
02:23:41,828 --> 02:23:44,533
She will go in the dark
and come back in the dark.

1553
02:23:44,825 --> 02:23:47,238
No one will come to know.

1554
02:23:47,239 --> 02:23:50,860
Nainsukh, l'll tolerating
since very long.

1555
02:23:51,818 --> 02:23:54,107
Earlier too, you fooled me
by making me drink liquor.

1556
02:23:54,981 --> 02:23:57,188
Go from here if you
want your safety.

1557
02:23:57,437 --> 02:24:00,392
You have lost your senses.

1558
02:24:00,850 --> 02:24:02,848
Look, so much money.

1559
02:24:02,848 --> 02:24:06,345
After all she is a gypsy.

1560
02:24:06,844 --> 02:24:09,759
Everyone knows that she has
an affair with that prisoner.

1561
02:24:10,882 --> 02:24:13,254
She must be having so many
lovers in the nearby villages.

1562
02:24:14,878 --> 02:24:19,748
l won't spare you alive.

1563
02:24:47,887 --> 02:24:49,884
He is dead.

1564
02:24:49,885 --> 02:24:53,297
What have you done?

1565
02:24:53,298 --> 02:24:55,296
Grandpa!

1566
02:24:57,877 --> 02:24:58,792
Hide.

1567
02:25:01,415 --> 02:25:03,705
O God!
lt is so dark here.

1568
02:25:04,911 --> 02:25:06,908
The poor fellow
must've come and gone.

1569
02:25:06,909 --> 02:25:09,157
Grandpa!

1570
02:25:11,946 --> 02:25:14,610
This drunkard has made
my life miserable.

1571
02:25:20,438 --> 02:25:25,932
He is lying here, drunk.

1572
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:44,913
This is a good chance.

1573
02:25:46,953 --> 02:25:48,410
Take her.

1574
02:26:25,996 --> 02:26:27,412
Murder!

1575
02:26:32,658 --> 02:26:37,401
Put off the lights.

1576
02:26:37,402 --> 02:26:39,107
What happened, Nainsukh?
Where were you?

1577
02:26:39,108 --> 02:26:41,273
l've locked that
girl in the godown.

1578
02:26:41,607 --> 02:26:44,810
And l threw the
bioscope in the river.

1579
02:26:44,811 --> 02:26:47,351
Kill that girl too.
And throw her body in the river.

1580
02:26:47,683 --> 02:26:50,680
Have patience, sir.
There's an chaos in the village.

1581
02:26:51,347 --> 02:26:53,427
Let the night pass.

1582
02:26:53,428 --> 02:26:55,425
lt is very good for us. . .

1583
02:26:55,426 --> 02:26:57,048
. . . . that the police
has arrested him . . .

1584
02:26:57,049 --> 02:26:59,046
. . . under the charge
of Birju's murder.

1585
02:26:59,047 --> 02:27:01,044
Now if Phoolmati is
also not found, . . .

1586
02:27:01,045 --> 02:27:03,209
. . . he will be blamed
for both the murders.

1587
02:27:03,210 --> 02:27:05,500
And there will no proof
or witness for this.

1588
02:27:24,854 --> 02:27:27,435
Tell me where is Phoolmati?

1589
02:27:27,436 --> 02:27:30,765
lnspector, l'm tell the truth.
l did not commit this murder.

1590
02:27:32,347 --> 02:27:35,553
Harishankar, take him away
and put him the lock up.

1591
02:27:40,047 --> 02:27:42,212
Ramu's mother, daughter-in-law
hasn't returned yet?

1592
02:27:42,379 --> 02:27:43,752
Not yet.

1593
02:27:44,210 --> 02:27:46,957
What a trouble!
l wonder where she has gone.

1594
02:27:47,458 --> 02:27:50,204
There the inspector is not
ready to listen to Surjeet.

1595
02:27:50,413 --> 02:27:52,452
They have put him in the lock up.

1596
02:27:52,453 --> 02:27:55,408
My conscience says
he hasn't done this.

1597
02:27:55,657 --> 02:27:58,070
What difference will that make?

1598
02:27:58,071 --> 02:28:00,985
No one saw what happened
in Birju's house . . .

1599
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:04,565
. . . that one would tell us.

1600
02:28:04,566 --> 02:28:07,768
Daughter-in-law,
where had you been?

1601
02:28:07,769 --> 02:28:09,766
We were very worried.

1602
02:28:09,767 --> 02:28:12,598
Billu has returned since so long.

1603
02:28:12,598 --> 02:28:16,387
And did you hear?
Surjeet murdered Birju.

1604
02:28:26,792 --> 02:28:30,206
Dare if you open your mouth.

1605
02:28:32,121 --> 02:28:35,783
lf you want to take revenge
for your husband's death, . . .

1606
02:28:37,533 --> 02:28:40,112
. . . then this is the chance.

1607
02:28:40,113 --> 02:28:43,732
This is the chance.

1608
02:28:43,733 --> 02:28:45,441
Mother!

1609
02:28:48,105 --> 02:28:50,519
Won't you cook food?

1610
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:51,435
Yes.

1611
02:28:56,097 --> 02:28:58,345
No. Don't do this mistake.

1612
02:28:59,634 --> 02:29:01,840
lf you tell anything to anyone, . . .

1613
02:29:03,131 --> 02:29:06,127
. . . then he will be saved.

1614
02:29:06,128 --> 02:29:10,250
He who ruined your life.

1615
02:29:11,165 --> 02:29:16,576
Destroy him.

1616
02:29:25,816 --> 02:29:30,853
That murderer will be saved
if Phoolmati is found.

1617
02:29:33,143 --> 02:29:36,763
lf Phoolmati is not found, . . .

1618
02:29:36,764 --> 02:29:39,304
. . . then he can never get away.

1619
02:29:40,593 --> 02:29:45,214
He can never get away.

1620
02:29:45,215 --> 02:29:46,088
O God!

1621
02:29:54,579 --> 02:29:57,575
Because of my revenge . . .

1622
02:29:57,576 --> 02:29:59,573
Because of me, . . .

1623
02:29:59,574 --> 02:30:02,571
. . . an innocent will be punished?

1624
02:30:03,197 --> 02:30:04,070
No!

1625
02:30:06,609 --> 02:30:09,855
- Where are you going, Malati?
- l have to save Phoolmati.

1626
02:30:09,856 --> 02:30:13,103
- Stop!
- No!

1627
02:30:17,639 --> 02:30:18,513
Stop!

1628
02:30:28,213 --> 02:30:30,625
Come on, eat food.

1629
02:30:30,626 --> 02:30:32,916
Are you sleeping?

1630
02:30:34,207 --> 02:30:35,123
Get up!

1631
02:30:40,243 --> 02:30:43,239
Hey, get up.

1632
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:44,405
Take, eat.

1633
02:30:45,653 --> 02:30:48,401
Hey, where are you going?
The prisoner is escaping!

1634
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:51,439
Catch him!
The prisoner is escaping!

1635
02:30:58,267 --> 02:31:03,136
- What happened?
- The prisoner escaped.

1636
02:31:03,262 --> 02:31:04,551
Coming.

1637
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:08,132
Come, we're waiting for you.

1638
02:31:38,268 --> 02:31:39,557
Malati?

1639
02:31:41,099 --> 02:31:45,885
Yes. Master has
send me for that girl.

1640
02:31:47,716 --> 02:31:49,132
l see. Go.

1641
02:31:49,298 --> 02:31:50,215
Let's go.

1642
02:32:39,748 --> 02:32:42,161
- Sister-in-law, they
killed grandpa. - Quiet.

1643
02:32:42,162 --> 02:32:46,991
l know everything.

1644
02:32:52,359 --> 02:32:56,190
You were my clothes
and get out of here.

1645
02:32:56,647 --> 02:32:59,394
- But what about you?
- Don't worry about me.

1646
02:32:59,811 --> 02:33:00,643
Hurry up.

1647
02:33:04,016 --> 02:33:09,385
Go that way.
Hurry up.

1648
02:33:15,378 --> 02:33:20,457
Go quickly.

1649
02:33:41,811 --> 02:33:44,307
Are you going, Malati?

1650
02:33:44,808 --> 02:33:47,722
Come here and sit with us.

1651
02:33:50,427 --> 02:33:55,215
Master has send her.

1652
02:34:00,834 --> 02:34:03,454
Who is she?

1653
02:34:03,455 --> 02:34:07,119
Master, she seems to be Malati.

1654
02:34:08,450 --> 02:34:12,071
She ran away.

1655
02:34:12,072 --> 02:34:14,945
Don't just stand there.
Follow her in the jeep.

1656
02:34:16,442 --> 02:34:18,607
- Coming, master.
- Hurry up.

1657
02:34:21,437 --> 02:34:23,434
- Yes, master.
- Why had Malati come here?

1658
02:34:23,435 --> 02:34:26,431
Master, you had sent her.

1659
02:34:26,432 --> 02:34:28,931
You fool!
Run and catch her somehow.

1660
02:34:29,055 --> 02:34:31,594
lf she escapes from our hands,
l'll whip all of you.

1661
02:34:31,803 --> 02:34:32,926
Hurry up.

1662
02:35:31,284 --> 02:35:32,907
Malati released you.

1663
02:35:32,908 --> 02:35:37,861
Tell me what did you tell Malati?

1664
02:35:41,524 --> 02:35:43,937
Yes Sirju, it's me.

1665
02:35:43,938 --> 02:35:47,351
You thought there's no
witness of your sinful deeds.

1666
02:35:47,934 --> 02:35:50,099
But l know.
l have witnessed everything.

1667
02:35:50,348 --> 02:35:54,219
You killed a poor man and
wanted to dishonour a girl?

1668
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:57,965
You are so base.

1669
02:35:57,966 --> 02:36:00,422
Do you think Phoolmati will
escape from this jungle?

1670
02:36:00,963 --> 02:36:04,043
You bitch! Hereafter you will
not be able to face anyone.

1671
02:36:10,953 --> 02:36:15,907
She was here.
Where did she go?

1672
02:36:29,976 --> 02:36:32,597
Where were you?

1673
02:36:32,598 --> 02:36:35,969
Where were you?
Why don't you speak?

1674
02:36:35,970 --> 02:36:40,257
- Where were you?
- They killed grandpa.

1675
02:36:40,756 --> 02:36:44,086
Sister-in-law rescued me.
She is in the godown.

1676
02:36:46,626 --> 02:36:51,204
Go from this path.
You will find the police. Go.

1677
02:36:54,618 --> 02:36:55,741
Leave me!

1678
02:36:57,615 --> 02:37:02,526
Scream more loudly.

1679
02:37:16,596 --> 02:37:17,553
Leave me!

1680
02:37:19,634 --> 02:37:23,629
Have mercy on me.

1681
02:37:23,630 --> 02:37:26,461
l beg of you.
Have mercy on me.

1682
02:37:31,081 --> 02:37:33,162
Don't come forward.

1683
02:38:05,713 --> 02:38:08,084
Are you scared?

1684
02:38:08,085 --> 02:38:11,874
Nobody will come.
Today only you and l.

1685
02:38:12,373 --> 02:38:14,579
Till today we tolerated
whatever you did.

1686
02:38:15,037 --> 02:38:17,368
You even burnt our crops to ashes.

1687
02:38:17,701 --> 02:38:19,365
Even then we tolerated it.
But today . . . .

1688
02:38:19,366 --> 02:38:22,528
Today you attacked the
honour of our house.

1689
02:38:22,529 --> 02:38:24,319
l've been calling
her sister-in-law.

1690
02:38:24,320 --> 02:38:27,358
And sister-in-law is equal to a mother.
You scoundrel!

1691
02:38:34,726 --> 02:38:37,390
Sister-in-law!

1692
02:38:38,722 --> 02:38:43,759
What happened, sister-in-law?

1693
02:39:09,150 --> 02:39:12,770
Get up, you rascal.

1694
02:39:12,771 --> 02:39:13,645
Get up!

1695
02:40:12,836 --> 02:40:15,249
You scoundrel!

1696
02:40:15,250 --> 02:40:18,372
You rascal!
Your death is near.

1697
02:40:19,246 --> 02:40:21,661
Even if l'm send to the
gallows for your murder . . . .

1698
02:40:22,243 --> 02:40:24,324
. . . it will be penance
for Ramu's death.

1699
02:40:25,406 --> 02:40:29,111
And the village will get relief
for a wicked man like you.

1700
02:40:30,235 --> 02:40:34,314
No! Brother-in-law!

1701
02:40:44,346 --> 02:40:48,009
With the hands which you
have done good deeds. . .

1702
02:40:48,841 --> 02:40:51,547
. . . don't stain them
by killing this sinner.

1703
02:41:00,246 --> 02:41:03,242
You called me brother-in-law?

1704
02:41:03,243 --> 02:41:05,116
You forgave me, sister-in-law?

1705
02:41:05,117 --> 02:41:07,490
lf l don't forgive
you even today . . .

1706
02:41:08,155 --> 02:41:10,528
. . . l will be severely punished.

1707
02:41:20,893 --> 02:41:23,306
lt is no use, Sirju.

1708
02:41:23,307 --> 02:41:26,054
The police has surrounded
the godown from all sides.

1709
02:41:27,095 --> 02:41:29,718
All your men are in our custody.

1710
02:41:30,383 --> 02:41:33,255
l've come just to arrest you.

1711
02:41:34,504 --> 02:41:35,378
Yes, sir.

1712
02:41:41,913 --> 02:41:46,284
Let's go, sister-in-law.

1713
02:41:46,908 --> 02:41:48,073
Oh yes!

1714
02:41:50,946 --> 02:41:52,943
Don't cry, dear.

1715
02:41:52,944 --> 02:41:55,442
Everybody is helpless
against God's will.

1716
02:41:56,315 --> 02:41:58,312
Today onwards you are our daughter.

1717
02:41:58,313 --> 02:42:00,394
This is your house.

1718
02:42:00,395 --> 02:42:02,435
Yes, dear.
Have courage.

1719
02:42:03,392 --> 02:42:06,014
Okay, father.
l'll leave.

1720
02:42:06,514 --> 02:42:09,219
- l have lots of work in the fields.
- Okay, son.

1721
02:42:10,301 --> 02:42:13,090
Wait, brother-in-law.
Have breakfast.

1722
02:42:14,922 --> 02:42:16,586
No, Sister-in-law.
l'll get late.

1723
02:42:16,587 --> 02:42:19,583
Send the food to the fields.

1724
02:42:19,584 --> 02:42:23,122
Eat in the fields when there's
someone to bring it there.

1725
02:42:23,622 --> 02:42:26,951
Eat it here for now.

1726
02:42:26,952 --> 02:42:31,364
O Sister-in-law!

1727
02:42:35,568 --> 02:42:37,940
- Mother!
- Yes, son.

1728
02:42:37,941 --> 02:42:41,062
Durga told me that there's
an eye specialist in town.

1729
02:42:41,354 --> 02:42:43,226
l'll take you to him.

1730
02:42:43,227 --> 02:42:45,557
You will be able to see
after the treatment.

1731
02:42:45,558 --> 02:42:47,555
Then it will be very good.

1732
02:42:47,556 --> 02:42:51,636
Grandma won't call me
Lallu and brother Billu.

1733
02:42:51,926 --> 02:42:53,633
You have become very naughty.

1734
02:42:53,634 --> 02:42:55,963
l'll get you admitted
in school this year.

1735
02:42:55,964 --> 02:42:58,671
Will you do everything?
Or let us also do something?

1736
02:42:58,961 --> 02:43:01,998
What do you want
to do, sister-in-law?

1737
02:43:01,999 --> 02:43:04,248
l want to bring a
bride in this house.

1738
02:43:05,995 --> 02:43:08,991
- Right, father?
- Yes. Why not?

1739
02:43:08,992 --> 02:43:13,988
Even the girl is of our choice.

1740
02:43:20,649 --> 02:43:24,393
Welcome, inspector.

1741
02:43:24,394 --> 02:43:27,016
Surjeet, l've brought
a good news for you.

1742
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:29,430

Now you are free.

1745

You will have to leave this jail.

1746
02:43:36,049 --> 02:43:38,046
Here's your license.

1747
02:43:38,047 --> 02:43:41,377
Take it. Come with me.
l'll drop you to town.

1748
02:43:47,038 --> 02:43:49,244
No. l have lost one son.

1749
02:43:49,620 --> 02:43:52,407
l can't lose another one.

1750
02:43:52,408 --> 02:43:55,405
Son, l haven't even seen you yet.

1751
02:44:01,441 --> 02:44:03,854
No, Uncle.
We won't let you go.

1752
02:44:11,055 --> 02:44:13,886
Uncle, please don't go.

1753
02:44:21,463 --> 02:44:22,336
Get in.

1754
02:44:36,072 --> 02:44:38,362
Sir, what have you done?

1755
02:44:39,486 --> 02:44:41,941
The responsibility give
to me is still incomplete.

1756
02:44:42,898 --> 02:44:45,104
l have a lot to do.

1757
02:44:45,105 --> 02:44:48,101
l have to grow crops
in the burnt fields.

1758
02:44:48,102 --> 02:44:50,474
l want to get mother's
eyes operated.

1759
02:44:50,475 --> 02:44:52,472
l want to educate the children.

1760
02:44:52,473 --> 02:44:55,969
l don't want to be forgiven.

1761
02:44:57,093 --> 02:45:00,755
Please extend my sentence.

1762
02:45:17,115 --> 02:45:21,776
Long live my enemy!

1763
02:45:29,103 --> 02:45:31,267
My enemy, you have come?

1764
02:45:32,517 --> 02:45:34,597
Villagers, your enemy.

1765
02:45:35,097 --> 02:45:36,054
Son!

1766
02:45:39,550 --> 02:45:40,425
Father!

1767
02:45:45,128 --> 02:45:48,124
