1
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,185
Head for the goal!

2
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,735
Referee! That's a foul!

3
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,272
Take this!

4
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,459
We won! We won!

5
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,308
And they call us barbaric!

6
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,984
I've asked my
Political Party to allocate...

7
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,992
monetary compensation to
the victim's families.

8
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,555
What about the people that
you killed over the years?

9
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,660
What have you done
for their families?

10
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:45,043
Look Colonel...

11
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,745
I don't have a gun
in my hands anymore.

12
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,382
Now, peace is my only weapon...

13
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,088
You've been here
just for a few days...

14
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,085
and already you are
an "Apostle of Peace"?

15
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:11,131
Mr. Politician, you better
find out who is behind this,

16
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,630
or...

17
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,467
Or what, Colonel?

18
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,211
Or... it'll be an eye for an eye...

19
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,579
and a head for a head!

20
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,227
You're new here? Aren't you?

21
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,395
Yes.

22
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,600
What's your name?

23
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,402
Nasreen.

24
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,405
I'm Sikandar.

25
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,208
Where've you come from?

26
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,609
Kupwara.

27
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,415
I'm from Kupwara too.

28
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,080
Really! When did you come here?

29
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,215
About ten years back...

30
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,688
after my parents were killed.

31
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,467
Was it the Army?

32
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,109
No, Jihadis.

33
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,580
But...

34
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,518
Let's get away fast.

35
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,214
Hold on! I want to check it out.

36
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,014
Its dangerous!

37
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,182
You go on, if you like!

38
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,467
Nasreen!

39
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,014
Let's go.
- What happened?

40
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:50,246
Nothing! You were right.
Its dangerous.

41
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,687
Let's go.

42
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,406
We are safe now.

43
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,700
Ejaz. He's here. Look!

44
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,401
Come.

45
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,513
Will you play against us now?

46
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,578
You've got tell the
Principal about those three.

47
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,674
I don't want to complain.

48
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,278
Then I'll go tell
the Principal alone.

49
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,077
I don't want girls
carrying tales for me. - But...

50
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,188
This is between men. Look,
I'll handle it!

51
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,112
How's the tea?

52
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,246
Good, sir.

53
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,316
What did I do?

54
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,623
You made a foul move
with a Soccer ball.

55
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:29,124
Captain Singh,
give him a "Red Card".

56
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,259
With pleasure, sir!

57
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,463
Sir, please. I'm innocent.

58
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,666
I've done no wrong!
This is Zahgeer's work!

59
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,675
Zahgeer... Zahgeer...

60
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,160
Salaam, Zahgeer!

61
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,129
Salaam.

62
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,308
Makhdoom Pasha did tell me
that you were in these parts too.

63
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,242
He sends his regards!

64
00:15:55,354 --> 00:16:00,053
Tell that mercenary bastard,
times have changed.

65
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,260
Times haven't changed...
you've changed!

66
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:09,698
Yes. I have...

67
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,434
My path is different now...

68
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,343
Zahgeer...

69
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,725
Its time for peaceful dialogue...

70
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,521
we won't achieve
anything with weapons now.

71
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:48,734
Your Kashmir Peace Front, just
wants to win the elections...

72
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,501
what will that achieve?

73
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,743
Peace.
- Peace!!

74
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:04,622
In the guise of peace, you'll become
a lap dog to the higher powers.

75
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:14,599
Don't forget...
every dog has his day!

76
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:25,305
I know what you are
planning here...

77
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,179
you have to stop. Or else...

78
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,147
Or else, what?

79
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,116
Or else... its an eye for an eye.

80
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,487
Its always been an eye for an eye!

81
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:50,594
This time, I'll have my eye...
on you.

82
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,672
I'll need some time to think.

83
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,543
May Allah be with you!

84
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,079
With you too.

85
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,143
Hai Allah?

86
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,718
How many times have I told
you to sleep on the floor?

87
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,528
He's done it again, has he?

88
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,189
Don't you make fun of him!

89
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:05,372
Our Kashmiri Kaka
has a battle scar.

90
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,403
Hai Allah?

91
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,675
You men play games that
are too tough on womenfolk.

92
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,511
I'll get a warm towel...

93
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,610
Show me.

94
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,388
Sikandar, You have to watch those
enemy feet when you have the ball.

95
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,060
There were three of them,
Uncle Arshad...

96
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,195
too many feet to watch.

97
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,426
They may be 3 or 30...

98
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:33,295
If you're alone, make your
single brain count more.

99
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,367
Break lt!

100
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,606
Break the Black board!
- Go for it!

101
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,565
Let's see if you can
"Head Butt" a bullet!

102
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,465
No... Brother... Sikandar

103
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,234
Please, Brother... have mercy.

104
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,249
See you at the evening game.

105
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,767
Ejaz... don't!

106
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,319
Well done, my boy! Well done!

107
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,422
The state team selectors
should have been here today.

108
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,390
God bless you.
- Sir.

109
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,228
Now that's how a "Man" handles it.

110
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,154
I won! I won!

111
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:53,336
And the First Prize for
this Race, goes to Sikandar!

112
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:01,212
And the First Prize for Cheating,
goes to Nasreen.

113
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,094
Your run up to the Goal was amazing!

114
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,197
It was as if those three...
were scared of you.

115
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,363
What's the secret?

116
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,572
I waved a magic wand at them.

117
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,100
Magic? What kind?

118
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,246
Black magic!

119
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,048
You picked it up!

120
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,325
I used my single brain
to tackle my problems.

121
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:51,459
Sikandar, guns are the
cause of all our problems.

122
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,768
They were making my life hell!

123
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,606
You don't know what
hell's really like.

124
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,276
Salaam, brothers!

125
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,408
Salaam!

126
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:48,453
My Brothers, I know that we are
few in number, but have courage.

127
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:55,192
By the grace of Allah,
we will have a breakthrough soon.

128
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,325
Allah is merciful!

129
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,539
I don't know which one of
you informed on our plans.

130
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,445
I just wanted to set an example.

131
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,640
Bury him.

132
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,733
May Allah grant
you all your wishes!

133
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,081
May Allah grant me the power to
fulfill all your wishes, Aunty!

134
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,247
What is it that you want now?

135
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:55,321
All I want is to fulfill
my duties towards my elders.

136
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:02,597
So you think you are
ready to fulfill your duties?

137
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:10,064
You just tell me what you want
Aunty, and it shall be done.

138
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,405
Well, since you're
being so generous...

139
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,615
I would like a Washing Machine.

140
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,712
A Washing Machine!

141
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,114
Yes. A Washing Machine!

142
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,516
Make that a Washer-cum-Dryer!

143
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:36,099
I'm so busy dyeing
these Shawls, all day.

144
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,733
I hardly get time to do the laundry.

145
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,297
Washing Machine!

146
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:53,006
I know how you feel, son.
Soon that day will come...

147
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,644
when I'll demand a
Washing Machine from you.

148
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,589
For now, let's just ask for
Allah's blessings for your success.

149
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,550
Sure, Aunty.
- Come.

150
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,261
We've caught only four as yet.

151
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,295
Question them!
- Ok, sir.

152
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,529
Have they spoken?
- Not yet, sir.

153
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,701
Your name? Name?

154
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,302
Aslam Khan.

155
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,470
Aslam Khan.

156
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,377
Captain Singh, Search this building.

157
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,282
To the right!

158
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,015
I'll take care of him.

159
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,990
I have information that
there's a big operation

160
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,122
being planned by your men.

161
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,158
These are not my men.

162
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:47,400
They are from the KAF
- Kashmir Azaad Force.

163
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,665
Soldier, check the roof.

164
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,470
I'm from the Kashmir Peace Front.

165
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:57,745
We want our freedom, but
through peaceful means.

166
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:01,183
Too much talk, and very little
action my dear politician friend.

167
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,413
Show me where's the peace?

168
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,447
The seeds have been sown.
Be patient.

169
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:13,087
Patient! Attacks are
being planned here...

170
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,461
and you want me to be patient?

171
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:21,704
Just a few days more, Colonel.
We'll turn a new page in the book.

172
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,269
Every page is coloured red
in Kashmir by you politicians.

173
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,449
What do you people want?

174
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,481
Nasreen.

175
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,259
New CD Player?

176
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,429
New CD Player?

177
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,232
Mp3.
- Let me see.

178
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,066
Where did you get this?

179
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,936
Lts a gift from my father.

180
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,071
What?

181
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,574
It's a gift from my father.

182
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,553
Yeah, I know... these players
are pretty cheap nowadays.

183
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,054
Made in China.

184
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,386
Its "Made in Japan". Original!

185
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,488
Your father must love you a lot.

186
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:25,334
Yes, he does! He calls me,
"Flower of Kashmir".

187
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:38,640
Sikandar...

188
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,125
Sikandar, what's wrong?

189
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:55,462
If my parents were alive, they too
would have a special name for me.

190
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,333
Don't you have your Uncle and Aunt?

191
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,134
Yes...

192
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:14,414
they love me a lot.
But... it's just different.

193
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,655
What matters more,
is that they love you.

194
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,090
I hope to pay them back some day...

195
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,263
especially my Aunty!

196
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,969
When you become a
famous Soccer player...

197
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,564
you buy them whatever they want.

198
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:44,540
Listen. My father wants
to buy a new Music System.

199
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:48,379
Let's go and check one out at the
electronics shop in Hazira Market.

200
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,179
You go on. What will I do there?

201
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,082
Come on. It'll be fun.

202
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,421
Do they have Washing Machines there?

203
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,292
Many! You want check out some?

204
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,633
But, I don't have the money...

205
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,668
They don't charge money just to see.

206
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,064
Let's go!

207
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,108
Oh! Come on now!

208
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,237
Come on!

209
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:29,551
There it is!

210
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,356
Let's go in.

211
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,560
Come!

212
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,386
Go on! Look inside.

213
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,419
It's a little small.

214
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:03,989
So picky!

215
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,596
How about that one?

216
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,602
Is that a Washer-cum-Dryer?

217
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:13,999
Let's check it out.

218
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,000
I can't figure out a thing.

219
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,671
Move aside!

220
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:29,744
Make it stop!

221
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,626
I can't! Do something!

222
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:44,033
What's going on? Who are you people?

223
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,698
Who touched this machine?

224
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:52,500
Was it you girl? Tell me.

225
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,307
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

226
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,047
Leave her!

227
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:00,978
So! We have a hero here!

228
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,110
Please, please, leave him,
don't hurt him!

229
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,245
You stay away.
I'll teach him a lesson.

230
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:07,716
Now?

231
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,118
No, no, Son!

232
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,630
Sikandar... please!
For God's sake! Let's go!

233
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,329
Let's go... quick!

234
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,254
That gun has become a part of you.

235
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,622
I didn't know checking out
a Washing Machine...

236
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:48,757
...would be so dangerous.

237
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:53,561
Does it hurt?

238
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:58,507
It feels as if my head's
been spun in a Washing Machine.

239
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,176
In a Washer
- cum-Dryer!

240
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,647
Salaam, brother.
- Salaam.

241
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:16,114
Will everything ready by next week?

242
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,312
We will be ready, Brother.

243
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,596
Brother Zahgeer! It's me!

244
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:36,000
Javed, you should know better,
than to walk up on me suddenly.

245
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,739
Everybody is pulling a
gun on me these days!

246
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:45,474
Who dares raise a finger towards
someone under my protection?

247
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,284
A little boy walked into my shop...

248
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,747
and threatened me with a gun.

249
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,550
Is that what you
call your "protection"?

250
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,050
A little boy?

251
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,123
Yes! A little boy!

252
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,041
Sikandar, We want to
play with the gun too...

253
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,516
and, we want to join your group.

254
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,377
What group?
- Your Militant Group.

255
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,120
I don't belong to
any Militant Group.

256
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,618
So, I guess, your father gave
you the gun as a birthday gift?

257
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,996
You may have a gun,
but do you have bullets?

258
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:40,597
Look up the barrel,
you'll find out?

259
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,005
We'll deal with him later!

260
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,134
We'll get the gun for sure!

261
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,452
Welcome, Sikandar!

262
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,268
Do you only scare people,
or shoot things too?

263
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,343
You won't get very far!

264
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,210
Please sir, its a mistake.
It will never happen again.

265
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,152
Don't be scared, brother.

266
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,160
I just want to see
how you use your gun.

267
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,430
I... I don't know how to...

268
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,428
Give me the gun?

269
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,236
Don't be afraid.

270
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:41,990
Beretta 92 FS...
Early Nineties model!

271
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,727
The favorite companion
of the first Jihadis!

272
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,666
Where did you get it from?

273
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,197
I... I... It belonged to my father.

274
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:07,145
Your father is a Martyr?

275
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,369
Empty! You really
fooled Javed, didn't you?

276
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,970
By the way, what were
you doing in his shop?

277
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,442
I... I... just wanted to
check out a Washing Machine.

278
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,573
You're thinking of...
Washing Machines, at this age?

279
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,654
My Aunt... she really needs one.

280
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,416
Come.

281
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:56,523
Success comes to the one who
fulfills his elder's desires.

282
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:44,972
He said that nobody
understands the motives of heroes.

283
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:54,183
The gun jumps in your
hand when you shoot...

284
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,186
so always aim slightly
lower than the target.

285
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,665
I just have to shoot the gun...
once.

286
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:10,069
But, what's the target?

287
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,600
He'll tell me when the time comes.

288
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,709
Your favourite!

289
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,647
Soon, I'll pay you back for
all that you've done for me.

290
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,714
Really, how?

291
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:06,586
I... I may be getting an award...
for... for my Soccer skills.

292
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,991
I wish a lifetime of awards for you!

293
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,661
Eat.

294
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:24,147
Uncle Arshad,
why don't girls understand...

295
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,274
that sometimes we
have to fight for peace?

296
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,477
Lts something to laugh about.

297
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,549
I wasn't laughing at girls.

298
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,250
"Fighting for Peace"!

299
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,621
Have you ever heard
anything as funny?

300
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:32,740
Salaam.

301
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,141
Salaam.

302
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,224
Salaam. - Salaam.

303
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,617
Salaam.

304
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,025
Salaam. Please come.

305
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,457
Yes!

306
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:28,001
The Colonel has guaranteed...

307
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,540
...no fresh encounters
for the next six months...

308
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,272
if there are no more bombings.

309
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:42,010
Our policy is not to interfere...
either with the Army...

310
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,213
...or with the Militants.

311
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:51,216
You are men of Allah...

312
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,498
You have a
responsibility towards the people.

313
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,028
It's not for us to try and...

314
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:02,630
...change the paths chosen by
either Zahgeer or... by you.

315
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,376
A target is just a target...

316
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,447
be it an apple, a bottle,
or someone's head...

317
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:18,312
If the mind is focused on the reward,
and the eye on the target...

318
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,622
the hand will never tremble.

319
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,078
Nasreen!

320
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,226
I got 10 out of 10!

321
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:03,357
10 Goals! Wow!

322
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,033
Not 10 goals! 10 targets!

323
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,005
I had my final shooting test today.

324
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,373
I shot all 10 targets out of 10!

325
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,506
And now?

326
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,140
And now, I get a brand
new Washing Machine!

327
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:26,654
What do you have to do in return?

328
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,185
Tomorrow in Hazira market,
I have to shoot my gun... just once!

329
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,354
And the target?

330
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:54,282
You're just jealous
that I too can get gifts.

331
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,256
Hey Sikandar!

332
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,459
Come here, Boy!

333
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,262
Come here!

334
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,642
Why weren't you at
Soccer practice today?

335
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,184
Sikandar...

336
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,529
It was too crowded, Brother Zahgeer.

337
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,197
Who's the girl?

338
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,203
Who's the girl?

339
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,001
What girl?

340
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:19,351
I told you not to
tell anyone about me.

341
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:21,683
Who else knows about me?

342
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,560
No one! No one!

343
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,964
Who else have you told about me?

344
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:39,633
No one...

345
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,035
Liar!

346
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:57,684
Brother Zahgeer!

347
00:49:58,595 --> 00:49:59,619
Brother Zahgeer!

348
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:03,995
Allah! How did this happen?

349
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,325
Brother Zahgeer!

350
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,324
What happened Sikandar!

351
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,796
I killed him.

352
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:22,629
Hai Allah!

353
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:28,740
He hit me. I couldn't bear it.

354
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,039
I shot him in reaction.

355
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,408
He didn't even know you
were going to shoot him.

356
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:44,752
I'm talking about
Zahgeer Quadir. I killed him!

357
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:52,293
I thought it was the
man in Hazira market.

358
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:54,661
What'll happen now?

359
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,334
Did anybody see you?

360
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:05,273
Nobody's on the
short-cut path in the morning.

361
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:09,548
Clean yourself up, and
go to your classroom.

362
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,308
Bastard!

363
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:44,247
Got what he deserved!

364
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:49,759
Colonel Sahib,
don't insult the dead.

365
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:55,292
Are you his sympathizer?

366
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:01,598
No. But, he was a
human being after all.

367
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:03,096
Human Being!

368
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:09,774
Zahgeer Quadir...
Assistant Commander of the KAF.

369
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:16,275
A hard-core militant,
wanted for 72 killings and...

370
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,444
22 bombings.

371
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,146
Human?

372
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:24,420
Colonel, this will not
help the peace process.

373
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:31,562
Mr. Politician,
this is not our work.

374
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,097
This is probably because of
internal fighting in the KAF.

375
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,535
This Bastard pissed
off too many people.

376
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,642
I don't know whose work this is...

377
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:49,248
but, please no more
such encounters.

378
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,612
I implore you!

379
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,620
His men will be
looking for his killer.

380
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,288
If they raise even any
eyebrow towards the Army...

381
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,332
there'll be hell to pay.

382
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:08,400
I'll try my best to ensure that.

383
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:10,771
Get ready for a curfew.

384
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,021
May Allah have mercy on his soul!

385
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,091
May Allah have mercy
on all of us now!

386
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,224
People will surely take revenge.

387
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:13,462
You have to put the word out,
not to raise arms in retaliation.

388
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:19,265
They've struck a blow on the heart.
No one will listen to us now.

389
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:25,408
Maulvi, this is the
time for you to be firm.

390
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,616
Hah! Our people will be
holding their peace...

391
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:32,282
while the Army will be conducting
more of these "Encounters".

392
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:39,724
I haven't lost hope.
I'll go to the people right now.

393
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:46,000
It may already be out of our hands.

394
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:51,290
Got you! "Tough Man"!

395
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:57,093
He's not so tough
without the gun, is he?

396
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:01,598
Hit him!

397
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:02,729
Get his legs!

398
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,201
Throw him in the water.

399
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:17,616
Ejaz, lts too close
to the Soccer field.

400
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,181
Let him go...

401
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:28,154
For God's sake! Please
throw the gun away...

402
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,693
Throw it away!

403
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,223
We have to get the gun back.

404
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:08,301
But, where are they?
They weren't even in school today.

405
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,433
Must be fooling around somewhere!

406
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,468
In Saami Mohalla?

407
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:22,710
Heroes don't rob people.
What should we do?

408
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,110
Let me think up a plan...

409
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:33,120
Got lt! I know what to do!

410
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,123
Are we going to rob someone?

411
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:39,130
This gun will get us
entry into the KAF.

412
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:44,136
I don't think I am cut
out for a Jihadi's life.

413
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:49,277
Huh! Scared, A Jihadi is
a real life hero.

414
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,641
Yeah! Like Zahgeer Quadir.

415
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,085
Zahgeer Quadir!

416
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,664
Brothers, I have news...

417
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,126
What?

418
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,372
"DEATH TO...

419
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:00,046
ZAHGEER QU ADIR'S...

420
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:01,648
KILLERS"

421
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,574
Sikandar... Army! Quick!

422
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,740
Hey you! What are you doing?

423
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,608
I... I...

424
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:40,686
We were just paying
our respects to the dead.

425
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:45,753
Get lost now, before I send you
where they've gone.

426
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:47,754
Come.

427
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:50,693
Sergeant.
- Sir.

428
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,232
Go to the nearest Police Station.
Get two prisoners.

429
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,316
Hand over two prisoners.

430
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,648
But...

431
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:17,316
It's my Captain's order.

432
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:24,627
Tell your Captain that we
don't kill innocent prisoners.

433
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:25,723
I'm just following my orders.

434
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,107
Let me also receive my orders.

435
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,137
Sir...

436
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:46,750
The Army would've been blamed
for the School Kids' killing...

437
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,682
I wanted to make it look like
a "Militant Encounter" so...

438
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,024
So, you decided to kill
two innocent prisoners.

439
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,329
No one is innocent...

440
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,362
All these people are killers...

441
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,566
just waiting for their chance.

442
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,298
Kashmir!

443
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:12,045
I wish man had never set foot here.

444
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:22,089
Under normal circumstances.

445
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:24,592
I would've taken
action against you...

446
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,258
but, we're all under
a lot of stress.

447
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:33,530
So, from now on you'll work
only under my direct orders.

448
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,428
Is that clear.

449
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:40,737
You are my Commanding Officer.
Its my duty to follow your orders.

450
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,342
Of course it is, Captain Singh.

451
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,718
And you'd better not forget it.

452
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,009
Any doubts? - None, sir.

453
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:00,619
So now, school
children are our new enemy?

454
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,460
They breed Jihadis
in their schools.

455
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,626
Captain Singh...

456
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,299
Only a few rotten apples.

457
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:12,538
You know what they say about
rotten apples in a basket.

458
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:19,476
Two more were hovering around.
A boy and a... girl.

459
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,721
Rotten apples are in
everyone's basket.

460
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:31,089
We just need to find the
right way to stem the rot.

461
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:47,737
Keep an eye on the kids.

462
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:07,388
The whole school is in mourning.

463
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,514
Do you think he'll remember me?

464
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,583
You go home...

465
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:40,195
I'll tell the teacher,
you had a stomach ache.

466
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:44,191
But, he's watching!

467
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:49,662
He's going...

468
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,004
They all look the same!

469
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:53,536
We'll come back.

470
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:56,008
Let us know if there's any
information. - Surely, sir.

471
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:12,219
Salaam.
- Salaam.

472
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,422
Have you heard the news?

473
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,566
Zahgeer Quadir was shot and killed...

474
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,761
Hai Allah! Zahgeer Quadir!
- Yes...

475
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:26,072
and he was killed by three
boys from Sikandar's school.

476
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:30,036
Where's Sikandar?

477
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:35,114
He came home early,
he has a stomach ache.

478
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,009
Oh...

479
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:38,510
Where is he?

480
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,505
Please forgive me,
Colonel! I was forced!

481
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:10,413
Zahgeer threatened to
kill my entire family!

482
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,085
Get up!

483
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,550
When did you last meet Zahgeer?

484
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,217
Tell me!

485
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:23,063
It was the night I told him
about the boy.

486
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,295
What boy?

487
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:34,967
My stomach still hurts. I don't want
to go for Soccer practice...

488
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:37,236
I don't want to drink milk either.

489
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,377
Drink it! Everything will be fine.

490
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,414
You know I hate milk.

491
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:46,711
You know I hate little
boys who tell white lies...

492
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:48,714
Drink!

493
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,001
Who is it?

494
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,063
Open up!
- Army!

495
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,135
Aunty!

496
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:11,337
Aunty!

497
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:14,242
I'll hang a white shawl
when it's safe to come back!

498
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,008
Just go!
- Where?

499
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,344
They're looking for you all over.

500
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:24,247
They'll throw me in prison
for the rest of my life.

501
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:37,759
Only the Maulvis can save
you now. You should go to them.

502
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,425
How? I'll get caught in a minute.

503
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:48,768
This evening, I'm going to
my cousin's engagement party.

504
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,773
I'll come and get you before that.

505
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,047
But, where will I hide till then?

506
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,116
In the Old Water Tank.

507
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:09,655
Okay!

508
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:28,709
Maulvi, I believe the
boy is not acting alone.

509
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,017
I just want the truth from him.

510
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:41,426
He'll confess to us.

511
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:45,565
What we know...

512
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:47,663
we'll surely tell you.

513
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:55,267
What do you have to
say to this, Mukhtar?

514
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,273
The Maulvis are
our spiritual leaders.

515
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:04,378
No one hides anything from them.

516
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:18,591
Sikandar!

517
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:22,661
Sikandar!

518
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:25,662
Sikandar!

519
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,067
Sikandar!

520
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:38,310
Put this on.

521
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,079
Did you get this from my home?

522
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:43,024
No silly, it's my spare Burqa.

523
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,250
A Burqa!

524
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:48,025
They're looking for a boy,
aren't they? - Okay!

525
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:56,629
Take this
- What do I need this for?

526
01:12:57,306 --> 01:13:00,241
Two girls returning from
school will never be suspected.

527
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,368
Okay!

528
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,042
You wait here, I'll get ready.

529
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:25,722
Let's go.

530
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,730
Sikandar, you go on alone from here.

531
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,561
Wait until I go inside.

532
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,127
I have to go all the
way to Agha Chowk.

533
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,667
Don't worry!

534
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:41,265
You'll be safe with the Maulvis.

535
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,140
Keep it on!

536
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,407
There are soldiers everywhere.

537
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:53,479
Go now...

538
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:55,021
May Allah be with you!

539
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:33,992
Girls are not allowed
in the mosque.

540
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,558
I am a boy. Sikandar Raza.
I have to get inside, fast.

541
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:43,571
Why are you dressed like a girl?
There'll be an uproar inside.

542
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:55,407
Now will you let me go?

543
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:58,017
Where are the Maulvis?

544
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,646
They are in the room at
the far end of the mosque.

545
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:06,258
What's the world coming
to these days?

546
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:10,388
So he didn't sing the Azaan,
and since he didn't...

547
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:13,100
the sun didn't rise...

548
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:16,227
the people were upset,
and then he was ordered...

549
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,573
to sing the Azaan, and then he did.

550
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:25,212
Sir, I'm Sikandar Raza.

551
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,478
We know who you are.
You're Zahgeer's killer!

552
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:32,510
Don't worry son,
you're under our protection.

553
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:36,548
Allah!

554
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,722
Allah!

555
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:52,735
This boy had a bomb
in his School Bag.

556
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,670
You filth!

557
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:04,211
I didn't do anything. I swear!

558
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:25,281
Welcome!

559
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,164
But, where did he get
the Burqa from?

560
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:40,603
The same place where he
got the School Bag Bomb from.

561
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:51,982
Tell me about the girl you
saw with him at Saami Mohalla.

562
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:56,121
I don't remember too much.

563
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:58,556
They all look the same.

564
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:05,694
But, her eyes had a shine...

565
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:08,060
liquid brown.

566
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:24,708
Ah... my darling daughter!
My 'Flower of Kashmir'!

567
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:32,391
Lts time you thought
about her marriage.

568
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:37,590
She's my only true supporter.

569
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:41,425
But, one day you'll
have to bid her goodbye.

570
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:46,334
Losing her will be
like losing my life.

571
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,775
You love your daughter a lot,
Mukhtar.

572
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:56,677
I love all the children of Kashmir.

573
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:46,758
Got it!

574
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:13,784
Brother Mukhtar,
please give me a few minutes.

575
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:17,189
Come in.

576
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:23,662
Why are you here?

577
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:29,506
Now let me serve you from
now on. I... I have news!

578
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:30,635
What's the news?

579
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:32,441
There was a bombing
in the Minar Mosque.

580
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:33,605
May Allah have mercy!

581
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:38,545
The Maulvis, what about them?

582
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,212
They are safe... with
Allah's blessings.

583
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:41,687
Who was it?

584
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:45,590
The same boy who killed Zahgeer.

585
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:49,095
The little bastard escaped...

586
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:10,449
Thank you, Allah! You are merciful.

587
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:15,120
Brother Mukhtar, the
army thinks he had help.

588
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:20,517
A young girl was seen with him...

589
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:21,653
You...

590
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:24,060
are an intelligent man, Javed.

591
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:30,365
Kashmir needs men like you.

592
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:31,496
Thank you!

593
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,567
Mukhtar, you have to do something?

594
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:38,741
I'll leave for the
Capital tomorrow morning and...

595
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:40,442
...seek the help of my Party.

596
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:46,652
Only the devil would
commit such an ungodly act!

597
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:55,292
I'll leave no stoned
unturned to find this devil.

598
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:53,559
A fearless soldier will go to
any length, to fulfill his mission.

599
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:05,141
I don't want to see even a
single tear in your eyes.

600
01:28:11,552 --> 01:28:12,644
"Flower of Kashmir"...

601
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:17,322
the path to heaven
always passes through hell.

602
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:08,066
Are you alright?

603
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:35,199
I really loved that gun...

604
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,198
and, I can see that...

605
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:43,442
you love it too!

606
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:47,376
Why me?

607
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:53,013
You are a small
price to pay for peace.

608
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:00,485
Put the gun down.

609
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:04,256
You wanted to be a hero...

610
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:07,192
I did you a favor...

611
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:10,063
I put you in Zahgeer's path.

612
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,240
Zahgeer's death was an accident!

613
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:24,007
I just had to push
the right buttons.

614
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:42,095
Nasreen, this time I'll shoot.

615
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:45,695
My daughter is a true soldier...

616
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:47,699
she doesn't fear death.

617
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:32,243
Go get the gun, My Flower.

618
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:13,518
Kill me!

619
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:21,459
Shoot me...

620
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,334
...before they make me... like you.

621
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:46,247
We are safe now.

622
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:57,021
"HE'LL BE IN A WHITE CAR
ON GILGOTI ROAD AT 9 AM...

623
01:34:57,091 --> 01:34:59,582
...THIS MORN ING. TAKE YOUR REVENGE!"

624
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:23,241
Let's go.
