1
00:03:19,873 --> 00:03:21,593
Delhi, which was recently rocked...

2
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:23,753
...by a series of explosions,
is now shocked.

3
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:24,953
...by political outbursts.

4
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:27,153
The government that
was already blamed...

5
00:03:27,193 --> 00:03:29,913
...for their incompetence in dealing
with corruption and communalism...

6
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:32,273
...is now being accused of
uneven distribution of coalmines.

7
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:33,913
The President of
Rashtriya Jan Morcha...

8
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:37,592
...Ms. Samta Mukheriee,
has withdrawn her support...

9
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:39,393
...on the issue of corruption.

10
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,233
What Prime Minister
is doing is wrong.

11
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:44,473
I will not allow this to happen.

12
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:48,353
My party will vote against
the government in the Parliament.

13
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:49,793
Enough is enough!

14
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,353
Why this lady doesn't understand...

15
00:03:52,393 --> 00:03:55,633
...that I have a collision compulsion.

16
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:58,513
Please...
Please speak to her, Comrade!

17
00:03:58,753 --> 00:03:59,571
Sir.

18
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:00,873
Ministers are waiting for you.

19
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,713
Vande... (Ringtone)

20
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,753
Dixit.
- Sir.

21
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:06,913
I am with the minister.

22
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:08,793
Do you want to save your position?

23
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:10,553
We want to save democracy.

24
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:12,753
You don't have majority.

25
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,273
20 MLA's are supporting me.

26
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:18,113
4 Ministries... along
with Railway Ministry!

27
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:21,752
Sir...

28
00:04:22,473 --> 00:04:26,753
Your good friend is asking
for 4 Ministries, including Railway.

29
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:28,833
Finance Minister.

30
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:32,593
Sir, he's asking for
deputy Prime Minister ship!

31
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,233
The biggest challenge
for the Prime Minister...

32
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:41,153
...in this quandary is
how he saves his government.

33
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:55,713
Friends...

34
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:58,873
...mathematics is not in our favor...

35
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:02,433
...unless we add some numbers.

36
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:06,762
Lalji sir.

37
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:11,313
Hello, sir.

38
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:15,593
Dixit, the Prime Minister's
busy with mathematics? - Yes.

39
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:17,993
Can I give you a solution?
- Please do, sir.

40
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:22,073
Tell the Prime Minister
to visit Fatehpur, Rajasthan.

41
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:25,353
There is a Shrine of a revered Seer
there.

42
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:28,033
If the Prime Minister
prays at the Shrine

43
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:31,633
...and offers a blanket,
his government will be saved.

44
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,833
Can we expect a miracle?

45
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:38,993
County first,
and everything else later.

46
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:43,153
This is Deepak Ranrasiya...
always here for you...

47
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:45,313
...from Aaj Abhi Isi Waqt!

48
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:16,518
Fix the puncture, we'll be back soon.

49
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:18,838
Are you heading towards
the Shrine? - Yes.

50
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:21,718
You will definitely find
more potholes than road.

51
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,798
This is Fatehpur.

52
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:25,198
Wait for 5 minutes,
and take your tire along.

53
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:26,678
Fate can be untrusting.

54
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,958
Here you go.
- How much?

55
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:43,438
140 rupees.

56
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:45,586
Here.

57
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,238
Please give me change...
I just opened shop.

58
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,038
I don't have change.

59
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:50,638
It's alright,
pay me on your way back.

60
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,599
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

61
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,959
"I am song of the mystic..."

62
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:24,359
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

63
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,039
"I am song of the mystic..."

64
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:29,439
"Every moment I look at your face"

65
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,559
"I give my life to you my love."

66
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,919
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

67
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,319
"I am song of the mystic..."

68
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,679
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

69
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,196
"I am song of the mystic..."

70
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:48,599
"I am your spiritually,
you are mine"

71
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:50,759
"I don't understand
anything else of life"

72
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,399
"And if ever see anything else"

73
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,439
"I invite the wrath on me..."

74
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,879
"I Praise the stones
and pebbles of your streets"

75
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,279
"They are my precious jewelley,"

76
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,639
"I Praise the stones
and pebbles of your streets"

77
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:05,399
"They are my precious jewelley,"

78
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,839
"From dawn to dusk
like an obsession"

79
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,959
"I soak in the mud
and sand of your street..."

80
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,279
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

81
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,679
"I am just a song
of the superficial..."

82
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:17,039
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

83
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,359
"I am just a song
of the superficial..."

84
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,879
If you wear Hameeda's shoes, you will
match every step with your husband...

85
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:36,279
And they are so robust that if
your husband acts tough, you can...

86
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:38,359
Whack him on his
head with these shoes...

87
00:08:39,057 --> 00:08:41,257
"Oh oh my divine love,
oh oh my divine love"

88
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:43,857
"I take all your
woes all your blames..."

89
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:46,057
"Come my love, come my love"

90
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:48,617
"Calm me love with your shade."

91
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,777
"Oh oh my divine love,
oh oh my divine love"

92
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:53,177
"I take all your
woes all your blames..."

93
00:08:53,257 --> 00:08:55,617
"Come my love, come my love"

94
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:58,017
"Calm me love with your shade."

95
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:00,257
"I ward off evil eyes from you,
my love"

96
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:02,737
"I call you my god, oh my love"

97
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:05,097
"I ward off evil eyes from you,
my love"

98
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:07,817
"I call you my god, oh my love"

99
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,257
"Wrapping myself in
the cloth of your name"

100
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:12,697
"I pray for good omen,
oh my love."

101
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:14,737
"Oh oh my divine love,
oh oh my divine love"

102
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:17,177
"I take all your
woes all your blames..."

103
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,537
"Come my love, come my love"

104
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:21,937
"Calm me love with your shade."

105
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:24,617
"Every moment I look at your face"

106
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:26,857
"I give my life to you my love."

107
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:29,177
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

108
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:31,497
"I am just a song
of the mortal..."

109
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,937
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

110
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,217
"I am just a song
of the mortal..."

111
00:09:36,257 --> 00:09:39,497
Visit to the Prophet's shrine
at Fatehpur is incomplete without...

112
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:41,377
...buying Sayeeda's bangles

113
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:45,657
God blesses that home where bangles
and anklets make a sweet sound

114
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:48,337
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

115
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:50,697
"I am just a song
of the mortal..."

116
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:53,137
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

117
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,497
"I am just a song
of the mortal..."

118
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:57,817
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

119
00:09:57,937 --> 00:10:00,297
"I am just a song
of the mortal..."

120
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:02,537
"You are the divine
verse of eternal love"

121
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:12,257
"Come my wanderer saint, my love"

122
00:10:12,617 --> 00:10:20,177
"Come to me my home..."

123
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:29,786
"Come to me my home..."

124
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:57,331
How's everything, Aslam?

125
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:04,331
Same as the county.

126
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:08,211
Generous heart... but
our back's are sc^^^^

127
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:13,291
My fate is similar to
that of the Prime Minister.

128
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:16,171
He's being bothered by
his kin and neighbor and so am I.

129
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:17,577
I heard that your brothers
are having a heated discussion...

130
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:19,331
...regarding the issue of the Shrine.

131
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:22,291
Brij Bhushan Chaudhay.

132
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:27,251
Whoever named you
BBC... rightly did so.

133
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,331
You should've been an
informer for some TV channel.

134
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:33,331
They also hoodwink people... so do you

135
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:34,931
We are fighting
for their rights only.

136
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,451
You are getting agitated.

137
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:42,251
Add it to my account.

138
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:48,811
The village council will
meet after the evening prayers.

139
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:49,971
Be there.

140
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,911
Look, Sharif...
- What Sharif!

141
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,423
He's not worthy of
such a name or respect.

142
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:01,983
Let me speak.

143
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:03,943
Look, son.

144
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:07,543
No one knows who built
the Shrine, or when.

145
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:14,063
But... around 200 years ago,
our ancestor, Amin Khan...

146
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:19,983
...started attending
the Shrine as a Caretaker.

147
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:22,823
From his 12 children...

148
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,063
Fatehpur now has 400 families.

149
00:12:27,543 --> 00:12:30,343
As the family grew,
so did their income.

150
00:12:30,703 --> 00:12:33,343
But we're still poor.

151
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:38,423
Your own siblings can
hardly make their ends meet.

152
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:42,383
Some pull carts, drive a rickshaw...

153
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:45,463
...while others are
cleaners and carpenters...

154
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,143
...even junk-sellers.

155
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,303
Don't twist your words.

156
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:51,063
Just get to the point.

157
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:54,583
Well...

158
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:56,303
...everyone has an equal right...

159
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,183
...on the money earned
from the Shrine.

160
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,478
Yes... - Yes...
- Right, uncle.

161
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:03,503
Uncle... everyone knows,
I learned to pray...

162
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:05,185
...well before I could walk.

163
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:07,447
First with my grandfather,
and then with my father.

164
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:09,416
Me and my sons have been praying...

165
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,827
...at that Shrine for 10 years.

166
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,987
No one said a word, until now.

167
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:14,627
But since we're making some money...

168
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:16,187
...it's hard to digest for anyone.

169
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:19,627
We recently learnt about
your grandfather's will, Sharif.

170
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:22,267
It's easy to make such fake wills.

171
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:23,827
He won't agree easily, uncle.

172
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:25,667
He needs to be explained
in the language he understands.

173
00:13:25,787 --> 00:13:27,427
Now the court will
decide this matter.

174
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:29,507
Don't try to intimidate me!

175
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:30,867
Let's decide your fate right here.

176
00:13:30,907 --> 00:13:32,227
I will kill you right here, uncle...

177
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:33,827
He is abusing us...

178
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:35,307
We might be poor,
but even we have respect.

179
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,987
Yes...

180
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,128
We will kill you...

181
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:40,481
We will kill you now...

182
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:56,944
Did the council reach a conclusion
or did they just debate on the issue?

183
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:58,787
400 families claim a right...

184
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,507
...to the money earned at the Shrine.

185
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:01,907
400?

186
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:04,827
Then what will we get?

187
00:14:05,187 --> 00:14:07,387
And Sharif won't
give a penny to anyone.

188
00:14:07,507 --> 00:14:09,307
So it's been decided, that one after
another the head of each family...

189
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:11,947
...will be present at the Shrine.

190
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:14,387
He'll conduct the
rites and rituals...

191
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:16,827
...and also take the
days offering with him.

192
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:19,107
When will it be your turn?

193
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:21,427
Once in 1.25 years.

194
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,107
The committee will inform me.

195
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,340
And what will brother Sharif do?

196
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,787
Take care of the Shrine and
look after the daily arrangements.

197
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,627
We'll have to give him
a 1l5th share of the offering.

198
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:35,542
And he was also train us
to perform the rites and rituals.

199
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,944
And I'll have to get
my uniform stitched as well.

200
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,076
Are they giving us butter
to eat or just smell from afar

201
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,120
You should be thankful to God.

202
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,040
Once in every 1.25 years,
your husband...

203
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,400
...will be the attendant for a day.

204
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,400
All you do is write letters
to those bloody crooks.

205
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,800
Curse these film magazines...

206
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,480
...who also publish names
and address of film-makers.

207
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:11,862
If your ancestors hadn't
left us the house and shop...

208
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,000
...then, we wouldn't
be getting the rent either.

209
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:15,712
Have you ever thought about...

210
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:18,320
...earning a penny,
rather than writing your poetry.

211
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:20,438
How long are you
going to force people...

212
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:22,560
...to listen to your poetry
in exchange of a cup of tea?

213
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,880
That Aslam is much
better compared to you.

214
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,509
At least he fixes
tires and makes a living.

215
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:28,400
Don't take that uncouth man's name.

216
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,600
He's not worthy
of being our neighbor.

217
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:32,652
Do what you want.

218
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:45,556
I've written a poem in your honor

219
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:51,211
Please take a look.

220
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:55,091
Get lost,
or someday I'll claw your face.

221
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:58,851
I am... ready to endure the pain.

222
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:01,331
Hello, Habib Saab.

223
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:04,091
Let's have a cup of tea.
- Wait.

224
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,971
First the poetry.
- Of course.

225
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:10,611
"I can accept you're angry with me."

226
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,931
"But you won't find anyone
as crazily in love with you as me."

227
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:17,251
Wonderful.
- Habib Saab

228
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,851
"If you wanted to mention about her,
then let's begin with her."

229
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:23,371
"If I can spare sometime
from this cruel love..."

230
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:24,891
"...I'll get to see her."

231
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:27,851
Mister, please get him
some biscuits along with tea.

232
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:30,131
But please take this
gathering somewhere else.

233
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:31,411
I'll be truly grateful.

234
00:16:42,383 --> 00:16:44,131
Hey Puncture Master...

235
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:46,563
This is a neighborhood
of educated people.

236
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:49,483
Not of uncouth people like you.

237
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:50,723
What's wrong now?

238
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:54,883
If you can't afford a waste basket
then I can lend you some money.

239
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:57,469
The area outside your
house is always littered...

240
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:01,323
...with paper,
polythene bags or bones.

241
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:03,096
And this filthy water.

242
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,283
What do you think this alley is?

243
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:07,443
Education may or
may not have benefits...

244
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:10,363
...but it does make
a man crooked and slimy.

245
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:14,003
And if he's a fake poet like you,
then it also makes him a scoundrel.

246
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,683
Aslam, know your limits.

247
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:18,963
Why are you spoiling your morning?

248
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:21,483
He has all the time in the world.

249
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,883
You're sensible, Fauzia.

250
00:17:24,963 --> 00:17:26,883
Why don't you try
to explain your husband?

251
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:29,563
We can't control
the force of the breeze.

252
00:17:30,243 --> 00:17:32,123
What does Habib sir want after all?

253
00:17:32,323 --> 00:17:33,803
I am sure there's
a knot in his stomach.

254
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:36,203
Don't underestimate
your husband, Hameeda.

255
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:38,403
He can bite from his a^^

256
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:10,043
What's wrong?
Did you have a quarrel with someone?

257
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,843
With that a^^ Habib.

258
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:14,123
Well... two swords can't
stay in the same scabbard!

259
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:15,817
If your neighbor is your enemy...

260
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:17,083
...then you're bound to have wars.

261
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:20,849
That rascal has made
our love life pitiful.

262
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:23,769
If it's so painful, then leave me.

263
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:25,814
I can leave Fatehpur, but not you.

264
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,329
And what about your Hameeda?
- Don't scare me.

265
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,089
Her name gives me cold-feet.

266
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:34,769
Shall I make tea?
You'll feel energized again.

267
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:37,969
Until then you can read this.

268
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:40,089
Your neighbor left
this piece of paper...

269
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:42,849
...praising my beauty, at my shop.

270
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:46,889
"Sayeeda, you're my heaven."

271
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:48,769
"My Kashmir?"

272
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:50,649
Habib, you dog.

273
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,409
Kashmir can never be yours.

274
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:55,929
Can India-Pakistan
ever be good neighbors?

275
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,889
If it wasn't for
the issue of Kashmir...

276
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:02,169
...and some misunderstandings, then
they could've been good neighbors.

277
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:05,689
Why can't two neighbors
live peacefully?

278
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:08,929
How's your training, Aslam?
- What training?

279
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:12,169
Everybody is just wiling away time...

280
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,609
What the f^^^^

281
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:16,209
He won't let me have tea peacefully.

282
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:17,809
Put it on my account, .

283
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:26,689
They were once good friends.

284
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,369
They both used to visit the
house of the bangle-seller together.

285
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:34,009
But now... they can't
stand each other's face.

286
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:36,369
Not the bangle-seller, her husband.

287
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:37,449
They were best friends.

288
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:38,809
But what now?

289
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:41,489
Her husband is no more.

290
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:43,569
Empty house, empty shop, understand?

291
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:45,022
Hello!

292
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:47,689
It's been really long...

293
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:50,889
...since you last made
a betel-leaf for Sayeeda.

294
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:56,049
She is not very sociable these
days. I don't visit her too often.

295
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:57,889
How is Sayeeda?

296
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:00,009
Lonely.

297
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,729
Even with you around?

298
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:05,409
It takes time to heal old wounds.

299
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:08,649
I guess your neighbor's
been treating her wounds.

300
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:13,489
His scooter is often
seen around her house.

301
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:16,009
Remember one thing, BBC.

302
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:20,249
Maybe not beautiful,
but sensible woman...

303
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:25,849
...fall in love with cultured
men not uncouth men

304
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:29,049
Habib Sir,
necessity never differentiates...

305
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:30,529
...between cultured and uncouth.

306
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:33,889
Who knows... he might
just sever your chance.

307
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:41,049
Now try and go and meet Sayeeda.

308
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,620
Aslam Puncture Repairs,
Day and Night service.

309
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,028
Now even I will have
to spend my nights alone?

310
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:16,660
What's wrong with you?

311
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,980
Ty to understand sweetheart.

312
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,500
I've got the training at the Shrine,
then there's Hameeda...

313
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,660
...and to top it all,
I got a flat tire.

314
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,860
Stop making excuses.

315
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,740
There are 24 hours in a day.

316
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,900
And can't you get another a ride?

317
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,860
Habib's much better than you.

318
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,820
At least he keeps
hanging around my lane.

319
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,980
Hello... hello...

320
00:22:11,052 --> 00:22:15,700
"He gave me pain... and I
stole the medication from him."

321
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:20,100
"He was busy with his lover..."

322
00:22:20,762 --> 00:22:22,300
"...and I deflated his tires."

323
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,900
Shut up you fool.

324
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:32,896
"The thief's after your bundle, (Alternate?)

325
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:35,639
Valuables wake up o traveler."

326
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,780
"What you call half empty,
is half filled."

327
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:44,780
"The thief's after your bundle,
valuables wake up o traveler."

328
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:48,408
What's wrong?

329
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:50,768
I've got a flat tire again.

330
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:52,686
I don't know what's happening.

331
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:54,208
Since I became the
caretaker at the Shrine...

332
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,288
...I have become someone's enemy.

333
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:59,328
Don't be under the illusion
That you have become a big man...

334
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:01,048
Who would have any enmity with you?

335
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:04,408
You fix punctures...
carry some tools along.

336
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:11,368
Let's see how many
times that m^^#^^ punctures my tyres

337
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:18,489
How can you play cricket...

338
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:21,408
...when serial blasts are
happening in the county?

339
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:24,968
What is the latest
on serial blasts, Dixit?

340
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:28,248
Sir, Pakistan has
denied any involvement.

341
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:32,288
I don't like the
way you say 'Pakistan'.

342
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:34,150
Sorry, sir.

343
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,148
Our neighbor has
denied any involvement.

344
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:40,508
Sir...

345
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:42,556
Fatehpur?

346
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:44,188
Prime Minister's coming to Fatehpur!

347
00:23:44,268 --> 00:23:46,151
Prime Minister's coming!
- Prime Minister's coming!

348
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,988
Prime Minister's coming!

349
00:24:09,788 --> 00:24:11,788
You should keep that
thing switched off at such a time

350
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:15,948
Hello, Aslam Day and Night service.

351
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:17,228
Day and night...

352
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:20,068
You'll give service
only if your shop exists.

353
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:21,868
The municipality is
razing down your shop.

354
00:24:21,948 --> 00:24:23,348
What the...

355
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:26,708
What's wrong, Aslam?

356
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:29,308
Disaster... Sayeeda... s^^#^^...
one more disaster for me...

357
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:32,268
At least finish what you started!

358
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:38,188
Get out... come on!

359
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:41,708
Get out... come on!

360
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:44,388
Stop!

361
00:24:44,468 --> 00:24:45,788
Hey mister...

362
00:24:45,908 --> 00:24:47,268
What are you doing?

363
00:24:47,428 --> 00:24:49,148
The Prime Minister's coming
to Fatehpur. Get him out of here.

364
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,548
So what's that got
to do with my shop?

365
00:24:51,628 --> 00:24:53,108
You can rebuild it once he leaves.

366
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:54,188
Get moving.
- But...

367
00:24:54,228 --> 00:24:57,308
Come on...
Get lost!

368
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,748
Clean it.

369
00:24:58,828 --> 00:24:59,929
Get lost!

370
00:25:06,877 --> 00:25:08,190
Come on, hurry up.

371
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,469
Clear it.

372
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,549
Remove it.

373
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:12,554
Remove that too.

374
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:26,584
Now that the Prime
Minister's coming...

375
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:27,544
...you are building roads.

376
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:30,104
Didn't you notice
the potholes earlier?

377
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:32,144
And now you are
razing down our shops.

378
00:25:32,184 --> 00:25:33,664
Every official is corrupt.

379
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:34,384
Hey...

380
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:36,144
Did you ask the Prime
Minister back then?

381
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:37,704
Let the Prime Minister come.

382
00:25:37,784 --> 00:25:40,064
I'm going to ask him
how much he's been bribed.

383
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:42,784
Even we have a television.
I know everything.

384
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:45,024
Every government official is corrupt.

385
00:25:45,104 --> 00:25:46,880
Down with the Prime Minister!

386
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,264
Down with the Prime Minister!

387
00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:51,464
Down with the Prime Minister!
- Down! Down!

388
00:25:51,504 --> 00:25:54,624
Down with the Prime Minister!
- Down! Down!

389
00:25:54,864 --> 00:25:59,144
When the elephant walks, few
things do get crushed under his feet.

390
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,864
But think, this town,
which never saw any progress.

391
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,224
Will now finally see some.

392
00:26:04,383 --> 00:26:06,543
But s^^##^ why is the
Prime Minister coming?

393
00:26:06,623 --> 00:26:09,183
I When life becomes hell
one seeks the Seer.

394
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:10,823
He's in dire straits.

395
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:13,783
And is coming here to pray
for the stability of his government.

396
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:16,663
You think the prophet
will help the Prime Minister.

397
00:26:17,383 --> 00:26:19,863
Many have lost their
jobs because of his visit.

398
00:26:20,564 --> 00:26:22,863
Will he listen to the pleas
of the people of Fatehpur or Delhi?

399
00:26:31,783 --> 00:26:34,183
What happened was destiny.

400
00:26:35,654 --> 00:26:37,223
Don't mourn for it.

401
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:41,583
Everyone suppresses the poor!

402
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:47,143
The Prime Minister doesn't see
those who are plundering the county.

403
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,183
The Seer sees everything.

404
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,851
Mister... you've been wandering
around for a long time.

405
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:03,571
Do you want to sell or buy anything?

406
00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:04,651
No, no, no.

407
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:08,971
Can you dismantle
a scooter to an extent...

408
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:12,131
...that even its owner
doesn't recognize it.

409
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:15,034
Even the manufacturing
company won't recognize it.

410
00:27:15,074 --> 00:27:16,491
Just get the stuff.

411
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:20,451
I can... but I will need your help.

412
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:23,051
Why? Doesn't work?
- No.

413
00:27:23,771 --> 00:27:24,971
You'll have to steal it.

414
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:27,971
I am a decent man, I don't
indulge in criminal activates.

415
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:30,631
Do I look like a thief to you?

416
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:34,111
Then why are you doing this?

417
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:38,351
It's... about love...

418
00:27:40,271 --> 00:27:42,151
You can keep the scooter and...

419
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:44,471
...this too.

420
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:48,351
Then this is a vey
small crime, mister.

421
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:50,991
Everything's fair in love and war.

422
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:55,618
Stop. We reached.

423
00:27:55,698 --> 00:27:57,569
Stop the engine.

424
00:28:04,053 --> 00:28:05,190
Easy.

425
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:10,970
Stop!

426
00:28:56,364 --> 00:28:57,364
Hameeda!

427
00:28:58,164 --> 00:28:59,284
Hameeda!

428
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,684
Where's the scooter?

429
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:04,766
Someone stole our scooter.

430
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:07,244
Oh, Lord. Why did this happen?

431
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:10,884
Some rascal's sworn to ruin me.

432
00:29:10,924 --> 00:29:13,004
There's no point in yelling,
you won't get your scooter back.

433
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:14,604
Go to the police station
and lodge a report.

434
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:18,470
Whoever stole my scooter,
listen carefully.

435
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,164
I will have ba^^^ auctioned,
or my name isn't Aslam.

436
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:27,644
Aslam... don't make
such absurd promises.

437
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:29,844
Otherwise you might
have to auction yours.

438
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:31,204
This is Fatehpur.

439
00:29:31,284 --> 00:29:33,459
You stole my scooter, you ba^^##

440
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,964
Where's my scooter?

441
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:37,276
Stop abusing you...

442
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:38,905
Why would I steal your scooter?

443
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,684
You si^^##^^I know you really well.

444
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:42,922
You're jealous of me.

445
00:29:42,962 --> 00:29:45,484
But I never knew you
would be such a scoundrel.

446
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:48,136
Tell everyone why
I am jealous of you...

447
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:49,695
Hey, Aslam!

448
00:29:49,775 --> 00:29:55,175
How dare you hit my husband,
I will yank your tongue out.

449
00:29:55,215 --> 00:29:58,095
Don't you dare abuse my husband?

450
00:29:58,175 --> 00:30:00,895
I don't want to humiliate
Habib sir by abusing him.

451
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:03,175
Get lost.
- It's best that you take him inside.

452
00:30:03,255 --> 00:30:06,615
Rascal, you don't know me si^^##^^

453
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:07,975
I will...

454
00:30:08,055 --> 00:30:10,935
I will kill you.

455
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,935
I will kill you.

456
00:30:14,455 --> 00:30:16,575
Do me a favor and just
mind your own business.

457
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:19,415
Get inside. - I will
hang your ba^^^ on the noose.

458
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:22,383
Get in.
- You opportunist!!

459
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:26,535
Why is he jealous of you?

460
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:31,847
Hey!
- Hey!

461
00:30:32,274 --> 00:30:33,274
Open the door!

462
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:34,783
Open it!

463
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:36,278
Yes.

464
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:37,318
Hey!

465
00:30:37,594 --> 00:30:39,794
Are you Aslam?
- Yes.

466
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:41,234
Let's go to the police station.

467
00:30:41,354 --> 00:30:42,874
SP sir has summoned you.

468
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:45,634
Did I do something wrong?

469
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,154
It's an inquiry.

470
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:48,994
And how did you get hurt?

471
00:30:49,754 --> 00:30:51,314
My neighbor hit me.

472
00:30:51,394 --> 00:30:53,474
And my scooter was stolen,
I was coming to the Police Station...

473
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:55,194
We'll find your scooter later.

474
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:58,234
Stay mum in front of the senior sir.

475
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,314
Yes.

476
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:02,048
Come on, get in.

477
00:31:07,754 --> 00:31:09,754
Make more bombs
you rascal...

478
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,074
The police will of course arrest you.

479
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,074
Sir...

480
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:31,994
Aslam.
- Welcome, Aslam sir.

481
00:31:32,074 --> 00:31:33,074
Sit.

482
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,434
Sit.

483
00:31:38,674 --> 00:31:40,794
What would you like to have?
- Water.

484
00:31:42,648 --> 00:31:43,790
Get tea.

485
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:47,714
Sir... what's wrong?
Did I do anything wrong?

486
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:49,114
No, no...

487
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:51,234
The Prime Minister's
coming to Fatehpur.

488
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:52,676
And according to
the Shrine's records...

489
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:54,434
...you will be
the caretaker on that day.

490
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:56,874
I see... Me?

491
00:31:56,954 --> 00:31:59,674
Yes. So we need to have a talk.

492
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:03,714
You'll undergo thorough inspection
before the Prime Minister arrives.

493
00:32:04,228 --> 00:32:05,794
I hope you won't mind?

494
00:32:06,595 --> 00:32:07,499
No.

495
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:11,019
The Prime Minister will
spend full 20 minutes alone with you.

496
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:14,979
Would you like to reschedule?
- No. It's okay.

497
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:17,859
You really are a
fortunate s^^^^^f^^^^r

498
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:21,139
The Prime Minister of
the county will be with you.

499
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:22,979
Sir...

500
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:27,179
Can I go now? - No, no,
we can't let you go like this.

501
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:29,458
My car will drop you home.

502
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:39,063
Sit.
- Come on!

503
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:00,579
Stop. Stop.

504
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,859
Stop. Stop. Stop.

505
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:06,059
Stop!

506
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:11,802
Hey, thief! Thief!

507
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,477
Catch him! Thief!

508
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,659
Hey!

509
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:17,913
Hey, thief!
- Where are you going?

510
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:21,249
Stop!

511
00:33:24,863 --> 00:33:26,126
Stop!

512
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:28,787
Aslam, sir.

513
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:31,916
What's matter?

514
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:35,078
That's my bag. How do you have it?

515
00:33:35,158 --> 00:33:36,512
Why are you beating me?

516
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:37,859
Where's my scooter?

517
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:39,787
He has stolen my scooter si^^##^^

518
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:41,498
I didn't do anything.

519
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:43,005
I didn't do anything.

520
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:44,962
I only did what Habib
sir asked me to do.

521
00:33:45,002 --> 00:33:47,925
If Habib asks you to hang yourself,
will you do it?

522
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:48,885
I didn't do anything.

523
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:50,575
Aslam - we are concerned about

524
00:33:50,615 --> 00:33:51,919
The Prime Minister arriving...

525
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:54,554
...and, you're worried
about your scooter.

526
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:55,245
Tell me where is it

527
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:56,685
I've hidden it.

528
00:33:57,685 --> 00:33:58,365
Come on.
- Sir...

529
00:33:58,405 --> 00:33:59,245
Let's go.
- Sir...

530
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:02,285
My husband is a poet,
he's not a thief.

531
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:03,925
Sir, you're definitely mistaken.

532
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:07,465
Once I get out,
you'll be dead you Ba^^^^##

533
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,285
What are you doing outside?

534
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:12,001
I'll have brother break your bones...

535
00:34:12,098 --> 00:34:13,725
...or my name isn't Fauzia.

536
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,769
After you got post,
think yourself as king.

537
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,885
You've been looking after the Shrine.

538
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:22,416
But when the opportunity came,
Aslam took away the game.

539
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:23,496
Fate.

540
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:28,205
Definitely take a
photograph with the Prime Minister.

541
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:29,445
And stay close to him.

542
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:31,908
Otherwise the press will
edit you out of the photograph.

543
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:34,761
Hello.

544
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:36,961
Where are you?
- On my way, sir.

545
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,601
Hameeda.
- Yeah.

546
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:40,681
Hurry up... they're getting restless.

547
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:42,161
Beat him to a pulp, brother.

548
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:44,321
Only then will I be content.

549
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:46,761
Don't worry, sister.
Let him come out.

550
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:50,401
Ask the Prime Minister
how he manages in this inflation.

551
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:52,801
Wife, he manages with his scams.

552
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:57,041
And tell him that the Fatehpur
Municipality are a bunch of thieves.

553
00:34:58,281 --> 00:34:59,561
He's here...

554
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,361
^^^^^####

555
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,761
Run...

556
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:03,841
Run...

557
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:05,441
Run Rafique's father

558
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:07,121
You hurt my sister you B^^^##

559
00:35:07,201 --> 00:35:09,081
How dare you hit my husband

560
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:10,601
Till when will you
protect yourself from us

561
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:11,881
I won't spare you.

562
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:13,201
Stop.

563
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:17,401
How dare you hit my husband
- You can't run for too long.

564
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:19,481
Why you...

565
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,921
Run... how long will you run...

566
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:24,801
Don't spare him.

567
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:30,227
I will change my name
If I can't break your leg.

568
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:32,801
Why you...

569
00:35:33,001 --> 00:35:35,801
I am ready to be hanged,
but I won't spare you.

570
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,001
VIP! VIP!

571
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,361
Stop.

572
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:46,441
VIP! VIP!

573
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:52,790
To the Shrine. The Shrine.

574
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,881
Hurry up!

575
00:36:01,746 --> 00:36:02,646
Stop.

576
00:36:02,686 --> 00:36:05,355
You f^^#^# what's taking you so long?

577
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:07,001
Sir, I am right outside the Shrine.

578
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,615
The road's closed up ahead.
You will have to walk.

579
00:36:09,655 --> 00:36:10,761
I am the Caretaker.

580
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:12,486
Get down or I'll slap you.

581
00:36:12,766 --> 00:36:14,566
But I'm going to perform
the rituals for the Prime Minister.

582
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,126
I am the attendant...

583
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,406
Sir... sir...

584
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:21,886
Sir...
- You're still here.

585
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:24,366
Sir, he isn't letting me inside.
- Get in.

586
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:26,326
The Prime Minister
will be here any minute.

587
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:27,646
Speed up the car...

588
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:48,301
Greetings!

589
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:51,836
Allah...

590
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,876
The merciful...

591
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:56,636
Please put an end my troubles, Lord!

592
00:37:19,423 --> 00:37:20,596
Come, sir.

593
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,403
Greetings!!

594
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:25,236
Greetings!!

595
00:37:25,316 --> 00:37:26,374
Welcome.

596
00:37:31,186 --> 00:37:35,226
Seems very old place.
- Almost 500 years old, sir.

597
00:37:35,626 --> 00:37:37,214
Shershah Suri and Humayun
would also come here...

598
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:38,906
...to pay their respects to Seer, sir.

599
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:41,506
Rest is history sir.
- Lots of history.

600
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,026
It's very important, sir.

601
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,026
Hello... yes.

602
00:37:46,226 --> 00:37:47,466
Congratulations, sir.

603
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,041
The Supreme Court has
dismissed the coalmine case.

604
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,976
Government is not guilty.

605
00:37:54,346 --> 00:37:55,906
Seer's blessing, sir.

606
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,586
Sir, the Caretaker.

607
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,546
Shoes!

608
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:34,506
Mr. Prime Minister,

609
00:38:35,215 --> 00:38:39,112
please bow in respect to the Seer.

610
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:43,192
You don't speak English.

611
00:38:46,912 --> 00:38:48,952
It's been 67 years since
our county attained freedom...

612
00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:52,999
...but people like us
could still not learn English.

613
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:56,272
Please speak in Hindi.
- Little bit.

614
00:38:58,352 --> 00:39:00,072
How will India progress?

615
00:39:00,912 --> 00:39:04,952
I know... little bit Hindi.

616
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:09,312
Call Dixit.

617
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:10,712
Call Dixit.

618
00:39:11,294 --> 00:39:12,294
Call.

619
00:39:13,092 --> 00:39:14,092
Sir.

620
00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:17,152
Dixit!

621
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:18,592
Hold on, sir.

622
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,792
Yes.

623
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:24,152
Ask the Prime Minister
to bow in respect of the Seer.

624
00:39:26,194 --> 00:39:30,712
Sir, please lower your
head... in respect of the Seer.

625
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:35,272
Sorry sir, I'm in middle
of an emergency. I'll call you later.

626
00:39:36,586 --> 00:39:37,352
Yes?

627
00:39:37,392 --> 00:39:42,512
Now sir... please put your
head inside the blanket.

628
00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:47,792
Sir... please put your
head under the holy blanket.

629
00:39:51,512 --> 00:39:55,915
Now the Prime Minister can
wish for anything with a true heart.

630
00:39:55,995 --> 00:39:57,712
Ask for whatever you
want from the Seer...

631
00:39:57,792 --> 00:39:59,117
...with purity of heart.

632
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:01,592
This man bows out of respect to you...

633
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,272
...please fulfill his wishes.

634
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:06,832
Fulfill his wishes.

635
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:12,460
Sir... sacrifice is
the ultimate prayer.

636
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,740
So if the Prime Minister
can sacrifice one of his favorite...

637
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,940
...but bad habit, then the Seer
will bless him with abundance.

638
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,380
What...

639
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,780
What do you mean?

640
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,300
Like...

641
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,900
...illicit relations with women.

642
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,071
Or drinking, chewing tobacco,
cigarette...

643
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:37,644
Have you lost your mind?

644
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,220
Do you know who you're taking to?

645
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,660
He's the Prime Minister
of the county.

646
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,620
Sir... everyone's a beggar
in the Seer's court.

647
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,460
Everyone's equal, rich or poor.

648
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:49,260
Dixit, what is the matter?

649
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,540
Sir, he's asking you to
sacrifice one of your bad habits.

650
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,940
Such as?

651
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:00,660
Sleeping with another woman...

652
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:03,860
Smoking... drinking...

653
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,618
...or... something that you love.

654
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:09,498
I love ladyfinger.

655
00:41:09,938 --> 00:41:11,618
But I can... leave
Ladyfinger (Please check)

656
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:15,138
Lady... finger.
- Wonderful.

657
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:18,578
My Lord, please accept his sacrifice.

658
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:23,338
The Prime Minister is sacrificing
a lady called Finger...

659
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,018
Ladyfinger.

660
00:41:25,418 --> 00:41:27,858
The Prime Minister
is sacrificing ladyfinger.

661
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:31,858
Dixit, you shouldn't
behave like this with Godman.

662
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:33,218
The rituals are over.

663
00:41:33,378 --> 00:41:34,578
Sir, you can stand up now.

664
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,138
You may rise now, sir.

665
00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:39,298
Hello... I'll call
you after 5 minutes.

666
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:42,658
Khadim sir, you're a good man.

667
00:41:43,138 --> 00:41:46,978
I would love to do something
for you and your Shrine.

668
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,018
Any problem?

669
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:52,298
The Prime Minister
wants to do something...

670
00:41:52,378 --> 00:41:53,698
...for you and your Shrine.

671
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,514
If you've any problem, tell him.

672
00:41:55,898 --> 00:41:59,018
Can the Prime Minister
solve my problem?

673
00:41:59,098 --> 00:42:01,068
He runs the county!

674
00:42:02,522 --> 00:42:04,498
Cabinet Secretary, sir...
- Later on!

675
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:07,054
He'll talk to you later.

676
00:42:16,088 --> 00:42:19,473
Mr. Prime Minister,
all is well thanks to you.

677
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:23,658
You're troubled by our neighbor,
and me too.

678
00:42:24,278 --> 00:42:26,305
And sir, relations are
getting sour by the day.

679
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:29,658
My neighbors are
threatening to... kill me.

680
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:33,338
They say they won't spare my life.

681
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,791
What nonsense.
- Dixit!

682
00:42:37,111 --> 00:42:40,471
He's trying to say
that his life is in danger.

683
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:43,230
He's getting threats from... neighbor.

684
00:42:43,592 --> 00:42:45,871
He's also troubled
by Pakistan like you, sir.

685
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:47,231
All nonsense, sir.

686
00:42:47,471 --> 00:42:49,711
Threat from neighbor... Yes Sir

687
00:42:50,071 --> 00:42:51,311
Mr. Maulana.

688
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:53,934
Prime Minister is committed
to fight communalism...

689
00:42:54,014 --> 00:42:55,343
...and protect minority.

690
00:42:56,071 --> 00:42:58,151
I will make you talk to
the Prime Minister...

691
00:42:58,352 --> 00:43:00,351
Its Terror Alert!

692
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:06,151
Excuse me, sir. - No politics in
the matter of religion and minority.

693
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:09,271
Please call security
chief immediately.

694
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:10,471
Sir.

695
00:43:10,561 --> 00:43:12,111
Give him 2 armed guards...

696
00:43:12,191 --> 00:43:14,071
No, no... make it 4...

697
00:43:14,222 --> 00:43:17,136
Provide him with X... Y...

698
00:43:17,936 --> 00:43:22,151
He's a pious man,
give him Zed Security.

699
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:28,751
If man with money and
power can get security.

700
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:32,271
Then men without power and money...

701
00:43:32,502 --> 00:43:36,302
...can also get security.
- Yes.

702
00:43:36,662 --> 00:43:40,662
Give message to our
people and our neighbor...

703
00:43:41,062 --> 00:43:47,382
...that my government is committed
to protect every single common man.

704
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:53,342
And you will personally supervise the
security arrangement of Khadim sir.

705
00:44:03,422 --> 00:44:04,902
Right after the departure
of the Prime Minister...

706
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:07,902
...the Caretaker and the Shrine
were taken into protective custody.

707
00:44:08,302 --> 00:44:09,782
The Prime Minister was
recently given some information...

708
00:44:09,822 --> 00:44:11,742
...from secret sources.

709
00:44:11,862 --> 00:44:14,262
And these actions
were taken accordingly.

710
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,458
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind, sir.

711
00:44:16,503 --> 00:44:17,617
Jai Hind, sir!

712
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:19,731
Jai Hind, sir!

713
00:44:22,502 --> 00:44:23,502
I see...

714
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:25,222
Okay... okay...

715
00:44:26,222 --> 00:44:28,302
Ramdin, no one comes inside.

716
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:34,371
What did you say
to the Prime Minister...

717
00:44:34,451 --> 00:44:36,771
...that he has posted so
many officers outside our house.

718
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:38,651
His life is in danger.

719
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:40,851
No need to worry.

720
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:43,931
This is Mr. Dixit.
The advisor to the Prime Minister.

721
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:47,971
Get tea.

722
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:50,411
Come.

723
00:45:00,326 --> 00:45:01,691
Now we're alone, sir.

724
00:45:02,177 --> 00:45:05,891
Khadim sir,
there's been a big mistake.

725
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:08,531
By whom, sir?
- Maybe by you.

726
00:45:08,691 --> 00:45:09,691
Me?

727
00:45:10,851 --> 00:45:13,931
Maybe... by the Prime Minister.

728
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,331
Prime Minister also makes mistakes?

729
00:45:18,535 --> 00:45:19,934
Or maybe by me...

730
00:45:20,942 --> 00:45:25,811
But I cannot know what
democracy's going on...

731
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:28,247
...in the Prime Minister's mind.

732
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,207
Right.

733
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:33,527
I only repeated in
English... what you said in Hindi.

734
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:38,527
But he only understood what's
in favor of democracy.

735
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:42,807
He thought I was talking
about our neighbor, Pakistan.

736
00:45:45,247 --> 00:45:49,887
Now we cannot say that the
Prime Minister is wrong.

737
00:45:51,527 --> 00:45:52,927
Sir.

738
00:45:53,927 --> 00:45:59,167
Only you can help us now.
- How, sir.

739
00:45:59,647 --> 00:46:03,047
By telling a small lie.

740
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,727
I didn't understand,
please be a little more specific.

741
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:08,847
If anyone asks, you have to say...

742
00:46:08,887 --> 00:46:11,447
...that you've actually
received threats from Pakistan.

743
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:14,047
Threat to your life
and to blow up the Shrine.

744
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:16,407
But that's a lie, sir.

745
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:18,407
I received no threats.

746
00:46:19,047 --> 00:46:22,127
Si^^## I don't even
know anyone in Pakistan.

747
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:26,887
People will believe if you say it.

748
00:46:28,087 --> 00:46:29,887
And if the people believe it,
so will the government.

749
00:46:29,927 --> 00:46:31,847
And if the government believes,
you will get to keep the security...

750
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:34,047
...or it will be withdrawn.
- So withdraw it

751
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,287
I anyway don't want any security.

752
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:37,727
You don't understand.

753
00:46:39,444 --> 00:46:41,644
This concerns the
Government of India.

754
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:44,004
The government will
face humiliation for providing...

755
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:47,244
...someone with a big security for just
being threatened by his neighbor.

756
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,404
You will face charges.

757
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:52,924
For misleading the Prime Minister.

758
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:55,004
Misleading the county.

759
00:46:55,484 --> 00:46:56,924
Life will become hell.

760
00:46:58,564 --> 00:47:03,484
Either you will rot in jail,
or be running for court hearings.

761
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:08,164
Can't you tell a small lie
to save the honor of our county?

762
00:47:09,044 --> 00:47:11,604
Consider that we're
doing everything...

763
00:47:11,724 --> 00:47:14,484
...for the sake of our county.

764
00:47:17,124 --> 00:47:18,564
I understand, sir.

765
00:47:24,044 --> 00:47:27,284
Your husband... is a big man!

766
00:47:40,044 --> 00:47:43,263
The Prime Minister could've
given us two sacks of rice instead.

767
00:47:43,343 --> 00:47:44,764
Or something we could eat.

768
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,324
We don't even have a toilet.

769
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:48,444
I was... - Couldn't you
ask for something useful...

770
00:47:48,524 --> 00:47:50,684
...instead of complaining
about that rascal?

771
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:53,284
I didn't know that the Prime
Minister is such a nice man.

772
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:55,804
That he instantly solves
a common man's problems.

773
00:48:51,526 --> 00:48:52,526
Hello.

774
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,326
Where are you?

775
00:48:54,526 --> 00:48:55,966
I tried calling you so many times.

776
00:48:56,086 --> 00:48:59,646
Sweetheart, I can't talk right now.

777
00:49:00,926 --> 00:49:02,006
I'll call you as
soon as I get a chance.

778
00:49:02,086 --> 00:49:04,726
We'll meet soon, take care.

779
00:49:04,766 --> 00:49:07,246
I heard that you were attacked.

780
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:09,526
They are all rotting in jail.

781
00:49:10,526 --> 00:49:12,646
Okay... see you soon.
Goodnight.

782
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:14,246
Goodnight.

783
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:37,333
Come, sir.

784
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:47,271
VIP, sir.

785
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,126
Jai Hind, sir.

786
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:57,693
Inspector Rajesh Chaudhay.

787
00:49:57,773 --> 00:49:59,991
In-charge of your security, sir.

788
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:02,466
You will have to inform me 30
minutes before you go anywhere, sir.

789
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:05,066
And every person that enters
this house will be checked.

790
00:50:05,266 --> 00:50:06,986
This concerns your security.

791
00:50:07,626 --> 00:50:10,626
Allah! Are they all going
to stay here? - Yes, madam.

792
00:50:10,826 --> 00:50:13,146
And your expenses?
- The government will provide that.

793
00:50:17,592 --> 00:50:18,680
Go there.

794
00:50:20,878 --> 00:50:22,388
Get that rope.

795
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:26,586
The Prime Minister is
trying to woo the minority class.

796
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:29,386
The Shrine has 400 attendants.

797
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:31,906
Will the government provide
security to all 400 attendants?

798
00:50:31,986 --> 00:50:35,466
Aslam sir,
the media is creating quite a stir.

799
00:50:36,115 --> 00:50:37,763
Please talk to them once.

800
00:50:38,564 --> 00:50:39,564
Come.

801
00:50:45,196 --> 00:50:46,226
Come. Please.

802
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:49,092
I am more comfortable on that.

803
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:55,416
Sir!

804
00:50:55,456 --> 00:50:56,456
Come on move.

805
00:51:14,746 --> 00:51:18,906
What did Aslam do to
please the Prime Minister?

806
00:51:19,071 --> 00:51:20,391
No matter what you say...

807
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:23,204
...but Aslam's prayers
saved the government.

808
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:28,351
Aslam sir...

809
00:51:32,711 --> 00:51:33,431
Aslam sir...

810
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:36,751
Aslam sir,
did you actually receive threats?

811
00:51:37,671 --> 00:51:39,751
Aslam sir.
- Tell us sir.

812
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:42,037
Is there any old enmity.

813
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:51,151
In the name of God,
most Gracious, most Compassionate

814
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:55,203
Only those whom the Seer beckons...

815
00:51:55,243 --> 00:51:56,443
...can come to Fatehpur.

816
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,283
Sir... have you received any threats?

817
00:52:03,403 --> 00:52:04,434
Yes.

818
00:52:09,323 --> 00:52:10,443
Hello.

819
00:52:11,763 --> 00:52:13,003
It's the Home Minister.

820
00:52:15,185 --> 00:52:18,123
Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord, Mr. Thakur.

821
00:52:19,173 --> 00:52:22,083
What's the status on
my request for Zed Security...

822
00:52:22,283 --> 00:52:26,203
...for the judge
investigating the riots case?

823
00:52:26,464 --> 00:52:29,043
Sir, we haven't received any
updates from the Central Government

824
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:31,963
Please wakeup the Home Secretary.

825
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:35,443
Isn't the Majority class'
life invaluable? - Sir.

826
00:52:35,596 --> 00:52:38,763
Did the Central government take...

827
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:42,762
...State government's advice before
granting security to this Khadim?

828
00:52:42,802 --> 00:52:45,750
No, sir.
It's being controlled from Delhi.

829
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:00,750
The one who threatened said he's
calling from Pakistan.

830
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,190
Did you receive a letter or call?

831
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:02,990
Lalit...

832
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:04,310
What's your opinion
on the India-Pakistan ties?

833
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,590
The Prime Minister has played
a political master stroke

834
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,070
Sir, you still drive a scooter...

835
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:11,030
Find out everything about this Khadim.

836
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,710
It's from my hard earned money.

837
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:15,470
Mukesh Ambani received
a threatening letter.

838
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:16,710
What's your opinion about it?

839
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:20,550
Who is Mukesh Ambani?
- Businessman.

840
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,830
But, brother Aslam,
why do they want to kill you?

841
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,390
You'd rather ask them this question.

842
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:31,150
Is it a terrorist group?

843
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,670
I don't know.

844
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:37,910
Who is this p^^^k?
- Don't know.

845
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:40,098
Is he rich?

846
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:42,190
No, boss. He's just a Khadim.

847
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,110
Since when have we started
threatening the Khadims?

848
00:53:46,467 --> 00:53:50,500
Was it one of us? - Boss... who
can do it without your orders?

849
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,150
Then who is this new as^h^^e?

850
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,270
Make the call right now.

851
00:53:54,643 --> 00:53:56,670
Who took the contract
to kill the Khadim?

852
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,030
I don't do such menial jobs.

853
00:53:59,253 --> 00:54:01,903
You're in deep trouble yourself,
Hidayat boss.

854
00:54:01,943 --> 00:54:06,670
No wonder Hidayat
Bhai is so weak today.

855
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,533
Is the business down in doldrums?

856
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,493
Just hang up you m^^^^^f^^^^r

857
00:54:12,737 --> 00:54:15,453
See that, I taught these three
ba^^^^ds the tricks of this trade...

858
00:54:15,493 --> 00:54:17,533
...and now they are
mocking me s^^^^^f^^^^r.

859
00:54:18,953 --> 00:54:23,013
If it's not these guys, then
find out who is this new a^^h^^^e...

860
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,531
...who's trying to
eat into our business.

861
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:26,693
We're already sc^^^^d...

862
00:54:26,773 --> 00:54:28,653
...and now,
someone's tying to f^^k us!

863
00:54:29,053 --> 00:54:32,613
Before anyone else does this job,
we should do it first.

864
00:54:32,693 --> 00:54:34,733
We will claim killing this man...

865
00:54:34,877 --> 00:54:37,356
...by breaching his
Zed Security. Yeah!

866
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:39,773
You lied.

867
00:54:40,373 --> 00:54:41,413
Did you lose anything?

868
00:54:42,773 --> 00:54:45,373
People pay to see their
faces on newspapers and TV!

869
00:54:46,988 --> 00:54:48,333
You're getting it free.

870
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:50,286
When will you remove it?

871
00:54:50,915 --> 00:54:52,733
We can't do it right away.

872
00:54:54,097 --> 00:54:55,674
But it will be done soon.

873
00:55:01,062 --> 00:55:02,333
This is my number.

874
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:06,453
Call me if you need anything.

875
00:55:10,686 --> 00:55:11,716
Jai Hind sir.

876
00:55:42,874 --> 00:55:46,053
"Changes an atom into a mountain"

877
00:55:48,528 --> 00:55:50,773
"A mountain into an atom."

878
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,200
"You may play with a dice,"

879
00:55:58,742 --> 00:55:59,680
Now you can't even
loo peacefully.

880
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,080
"But the real game
is in His hands."

881
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,880
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

882
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,720
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

883
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,560
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

884
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,146
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

885
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,120
Sir, big problem due to no toilets,

886
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,880
How about we build
a toilet in the house?

887
00:56:25,237 --> 00:56:28,920
Brother Aslam,
let me know if you need anything.

888
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,160
Aslam sir,
it's the Collector speaking.

889
00:56:32,975 --> 00:56:34,934
You haven't called me for anything.

890
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,480
What was the Collector was saying?

891
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,154
He razed down your shop, didn't he?

892
00:56:40,532 --> 00:56:42,960
So he's offering
to give a bigger shop.

893
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,120
So?

894
00:56:44,303 --> 00:56:46,760
Should I take it?
After all, I helped my county.

895
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,640
How will you face Allah?

896
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,760
Then spend the rest
of your life in poverty.

897
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:58,444
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

898
00:56:58,524 --> 00:57:01,204
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

899
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:04,044
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

900
00:57:04,084 --> 00:57:06,804
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

901
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,644
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

902
00:57:09,684 --> 00:57:12,444
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

903
00:57:12,524 --> 00:57:15,244
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

904
00:57:15,884 --> 00:57:18,124
Don't push me, I am a common man too.

905
00:57:18,204 --> 00:57:20,844
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

906
00:57:20,924 --> 00:57:23,764
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

907
00:57:24,084 --> 00:57:26,644
Sister Hamida, can I get some water?

908
00:57:26,804 --> 00:57:28,164
Sister.
- Yes.

909
00:57:28,484 --> 00:57:29,484
I've brought milk.

910
00:57:29,924 --> 00:57:30,964
Make some tea.

911
00:57:31,204 --> 00:57:33,804
Sister... can I get some spices?

912
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:34,884
We want to cook chicken.

913
00:57:34,924 --> 00:57:40,084
"Yesterday's pauper"

914
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:43,964
"Becomes prosperous today"

915
00:57:46,598 --> 00:57:50,964
"A have-not becomes a VIP"

916
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:56,884
"A have-not becomes a VIP"

917
00:57:57,435 --> 00:58:02,644
"This is how fortunes change"

918
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:05,644
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

919
00:58:05,867 --> 00:58:08,594
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

920
00:58:08,674 --> 00:58:11,434
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

921
00:58:11,514 --> 00:58:14,154
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

922
00:58:16,874 --> 00:58:18,554
Come sister, I will drop you home.

923
00:58:19,923 --> 00:58:23,474
"The Almighty overturns
destiny in a moment."

924
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:27,114
Hamida.
Show the children your Zed Security.

925
00:58:34,154 --> 00:58:35,154
Sister.

926
00:58:35,754 --> 00:58:37,474
The ration is too much for us.

927
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:38,754
Why don't you take some of it?

928
00:58:38,794 --> 00:58:41,314
I can smell the mutton from here,
inspector sir.

929
00:58:41,634 --> 00:58:44,674
Don't fall asleep after dinner.
Stay alert.

930
00:58:57,114 --> 00:58:59,634
Tomorrow if he decides to
stay in the Presidential home...

931
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:01,834
...will the government comply?

932
00:59:01,874 --> 00:59:03,354
His life was in danger.

933
00:59:03,434 --> 00:59:05,124
So they are protecting him.

934
00:59:05,204 --> 00:59:07,874
Tomorrow if he asks for ration,
will the government provide him?

935
00:59:07,914 --> 00:59:10,194
And who provides the government?

936
00:59:10,274 --> 00:59:13,394
They're having a ball on
the expense of the common man.

937
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:15,714
I'm under tight security
24 hours a day, sweetheart.

938
00:59:15,794 --> 00:59:18,314
How can I come see
you with the entire army?

939
00:59:18,983 --> 00:59:20,674
So... why don't you tell Hamida?

940
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,274
Then even Zed Security
won't be able to save me.

941
00:59:23,354 --> 00:59:26,234
Aslam... are you deceiving me?

942
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,990
How can I deceive you?
I am the one being deceived.

943
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,320
Hello. Hello...

944
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,920
Congratulations for your freedom.

945
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,200
When were you released?

946
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,240
You should never ask this question...

947
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,000
...to someone who's
going through a bad phase.

948
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,400
I was released just moments ago.

949
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,760
Be careful... shots can
be fired from any direction.

950
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,320
Zed Security is very dangerous.

951
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,240
That cheat is the
one who has to worry.

952
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,720
He never received any threats.

953
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,800
Someday he will pay for his actions.

954
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:04,400
Even you took care of the shrine.

955
01:00:05,618 --> 01:00:07,240
But did you ever receive any threats?

956
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:12,040
We have come across many VIPs.

957
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,160
But this is the first time
we have a family away from our home.

958
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,360
I want to get them out of here...

959
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,080
...and you're inviting them in.

960
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,857
You're taking real good care of them.

961
01:00:23,092 --> 01:00:25,563
Mutton... feasts...

962
01:00:26,355 --> 01:00:29,276
You don't earn a penny anymore,
and now you're criticizing me.

963
01:00:29,596 --> 01:00:31,796
I've been telling you
for 10 years... to build a toilet.

964
01:00:31,876 --> 01:00:33,516
They got it made in a day.

965
01:00:33,636 --> 01:00:35,636
They are also giving
us their share of ration.

966
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:38,556
And if I cook something for
them in return, then it pricks you?

967
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,086
How can one work...

968
01:00:40,126 --> 01:00:42,204
if someone's always
standing next to me with a gun?

969
01:00:42,836 --> 01:00:45,156
People avoid coming to
my shop seeing the security.

970
01:00:45,996 --> 01:00:48,796
What could be better
is that Pakistan kills you.

971
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:50,516
I could at least say
that my husband's dead...

972
01:00:50,596 --> 01:00:51,996
...and I've to raise my kid alone.

973
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:56,756
Sister... I've prepared
garlic chutney today.

974
01:00:57,996 --> 01:00:59,956
The mutton's ready, brother.

975
01:01:00,694 --> 01:01:01,694
Sir.

976
01:01:30,756 --> 01:01:31,756
Allah...

977
01:01:40,676 --> 01:01:42,076
Allah...

978
01:01:51,653 --> 01:01:52,653
Allah...

979
01:02:15,017 --> 01:02:16,275
Go on roof.

980
01:02:16,939 --> 01:02:18,969
I told you to stay
alert s^^^^^f^^^^rs

981
01:02:21,045 --> 01:02:22,045
Aslam sir.

982
01:02:22,925 --> 01:02:23,925
Sir...

983
01:02:24,431 --> 01:02:26,016
Look, is she?

984
01:02:26,645 --> 01:02:27,685
Sister...

985
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,245
Who is it?
- Sister, it's Rajesh.

986
01:02:31,806 --> 01:02:33,285
Wakeup Aslam sir.

987
01:02:43,685 --> 01:02:45,349
Did you check the toilet?

988
01:02:54,205 --> 01:02:54,925
Sorry, sir.

989
01:02:54,965 --> 01:02:57,245
Rascal... who am I
going to apologies to?

990
01:02:57,325 --> 01:02:58,612
Is this what you call Zed Security?

991
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,485
Tomorrow's breaking news would be...

992
01:03:00,565 --> 01:03:02,821
...VIP goes missing from Zed Security.

993
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,435
Find that scoundrel.

994
01:03:04,985 --> 01:03:08,885
No one steps out of the
house until he is found.

995
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:09,965
Sir.

996
01:03:12,746 --> 01:03:14,946
I want to throw you out.

997
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:17,266
I can't meet secretly anymore.

998
01:03:17,546 --> 01:03:19,986
What do you think... it
makes me happy?

999
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:22,826
Life's become hell.

1000
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:26,026
Feels like I am living
for the Indian Government.

1001
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:29,186
Why? Do you work for the government?

1002
01:03:29,426 --> 01:03:32,946
Sayeeda, I am in big trouble.

1003
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,106
What mess are you in now?
Who are you messing around with now?

1004
01:03:38,386 --> 01:03:40,946
Swear on me... you won't tell anyone.

1005
01:03:42,666 --> 01:03:44,986
I didn't receive any threats.

1006
01:03:45,066 --> 01:03:46,266
What?

1007
01:03:47,186 --> 01:03:48,226
Sister.

1008
01:03:52,586 --> 01:03:55,146
The government's honor
and our jobs are at stake.

1009
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:59,506
You won't say anything
until we don't find Aslam sir.

1010
01:04:02,057 --> 01:04:03,946
He has run away because of you.

1011
01:04:05,487 --> 01:04:07,266
Why don't you leave him alone?

1012
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:10,299
If anything happens to him,
you will all leave...

1013
01:04:10,983 --> 01:04:11,983
...but, what will I do?

1014
01:04:13,703 --> 01:04:15,103
Curse that Prime Minister.

1015
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:18,943
He's safe, but left us in a mess.

1016
01:04:19,623 --> 01:04:21,343
Allah, this is a big problem.

1017
01:04:21,383 --> 01:04:23,823
Dixit says,
I'll be jailed if I tell the truth.

1018
01:04:23,903 --> 01:04:25,223
Jailed for telling the truth?

1019
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,383
It's the question of their honor.

1020
01:04:27,783 --> 01:04:29,703
That means... you have to pay...

1021
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,223
for the Prime Minister's mistake?

1022
01:04:31,303 --> 01:04:32,383
That's how this county functions.

1023
01:04:32,463 --> 01:04:34,583
The government makes mistakes,
and the people pay.

1024
01:04:35,063 --> 01:04:38,463
The day this truth's exposed,
it will create a big stir.

1025
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,263
That's why I am going
to Delhi to meet Dixit.

1026
01:04:40,303 --> 01:04:41,383
I'll tell him to throw me in jail.

1027
01:04:41,463 --> 01:04:43,103
I am living like a prisoner anyway.

1028
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:45,943
I tried calling him thousand times,
but he isn't answering.

1029
01:04:46,543 --> 01:04:48,743
May the Prophet save
you from every trouble?

1030
01:04:49,543 --> 01:04:51,303
Can I help you?

1031
01:04:52,205 --> 01:04:54,303
Lend me some money to go to Delhi.

1032
01:04:54,383 --> 01:04:56,943
I left my purse and
mobile at home. - Okay.

1033
01:05:10,589 --> 01:05:12,470
We're not detectives, sir.

1034
01:05:12,757 --> 01:05:14,477
But we are investigating.

1035
01:05:14,557 --> 01:05:17,357
Rajesh, if any other
VIP had gone missing...

1036
01:05:17,437 --> 01:05:19,157
...then, I would've
already lost my job.

1037
01:05:19,597 --> 01:05:23,557
Sir, find someone else
for Aslam sir's security.

1038
01:05:24,197 --> 01:05:25,757
I am ready to face trial.

1039
01:05:25,837 --> 01:05:29,477
Whose security, Rajesh?
Where is Aslam?

1040
01:05:34,517 --> 01:05:37,237
This man... will ruin my career.

1041
01:05:39,757 --> 01:05:44,517
O Prophet,
once I get my hands on this rascal...

1042
01:05:46,437 --> 01:05:48,157
...I will come with
an offering at your tomb.

1043
01:05:50,157 --> 01:05:51,677
Hello.
- Sir...

1044
01:05:51,997 --> 01:05:54,117
Sir, there was man wandering
around the Parliament.

1045
01:05:54,197 --> 01:05:55,877
We've taken him in custody.

1046
01:05:55,957 --> 01:05:58,517
But we found your
card from his pocket.

1047
01:05:59,006 --> 01:06:01,637
He says his name is Aslam.
- Aslam Khan, Puncture fixer.

1048
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,610
He looks like a terrorist.

1049
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:05,530
Bring him to me immediately.

1050
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:07,690
Yes, sir... right away.

1051
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:14,250
Rajesh.
- Sir.

1052
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:15,890
Aslam is with me.

1053
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:18,570
Come to Delhi right
away... with full security.

1054
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,970
I told you his life is in danger.

1055
01:06:21,605 --> 01:06:23,570
I won't tolerate
such carelessness again.

1056
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,530
You too are saying that?

1057
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:28,610
But you know everything.

1058
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,610
Stop this charade.

1059
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,050
There's no point
in aggravating this...

1060
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:36,890
Don't try to teach me, Aslam.

1061
01:06:37,334 --> 01:06:39,214
Do you see those files?

1062
01:06:39,867 --> 01:06:41,847
Politicians, Ministers, Officers...

1063
01:06:42,141 --> 01:06:44,579
are eagerly waiting
for Zed Security.

1064
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:48,694
Without security, no one
will acknowledge them as ministers.

1065
01:06:48,774 --> 01:06:50,334
And you...

1066
01:06:54,934 --> 01:06:59,174
Don't rock the boat
if you know what's good for

1067
01:06:59,894 --> 01:07:02,214
I will talk to the Prime
Minister at the first chance I get.

1068
01:07:02,534 --> 01:07:04,414
And I will change
the security category.

1069
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:05,814
I'll keep 1or 2 men
posted at your place.

1070
01:07:05,894 --> 01:07:07,534
And later we'll
withdraw them as well.

1071
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:19,374
Come in.

1072
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:24,309
Yes, sir.
- Mathew...

1073
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,174
he's the Prime
Minister's special guest.

1074
01:07:28,254 --> 01:07:30,734
Please escort him to the guest house.

1075
01:07:31,534 --> 01:07:33,694
He should face no inconvenience.

1076
01:07:37,574 --> 01:07:41,214
They're on their way,
leave immediately.

1077
01:07:42,974 --> 01:07:45,574
Your wife's really worried.

1078
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:53,334
I am sorry, sir.

1079
01:07:56,492 --> 01:07:57,854
Have a look at this.

1080
01:08:05,104 --> 01:08:06,104
Thank you, sir.

1081
01:08:06,727 --> 01:08:10,694
I promised to get you a petrol pump,
and I have kept my word.

1082
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:13,642
Now you've to do one thing for me.

1083
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:15,402
Consider it done.

1084
01:08:15,562 --> 01:08:17,082
Fire a bullet at Aslam.

1085
01:08:17,922 --> 01:08:20,562
To kill him?

1086
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:21,762
No...

1087
01:08:22,482 --> 01:08:23,562
Only to scare him.

1088
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:26,082
He should be assured
that his life is in danger.

1089
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,322
Otherwise he won't stop his antics.

1090
01:08:28,962 --> 01:08:31,402
Today he's requesting
to withdraw security.

1091
01:08:32,269 --> 01:08:33,882
Tomorrow... he will beg for it.

1092
01:08:34,306 --> 01:08:36,002
To keep his security.

1093
01:08:38,082 --> 01:08:40,482
Hands... legs... anywhere!

1094
01:08:42,122 --> 01:08:43,322
But he shouldn't die.

1095
01:08:43,762 --> 01:08:47,242
Sir... this is a dangerous job.

1096
01:08:49,177 --> 01:08:52,061
Politics is a bed of thorns, Rajesh.

1097
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:54,896
There's danger at every step.

1098
01:08:55,336 --> 01:08:59,856
And only the close
ones... can be trusted.

1099
01:09:01,496 --> 01:09:03,616
And I need not tell you...

1100
01:09:04,296 --> 01:09:07,976
...that you don't have
to use an official bullet.

1101
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:29,336
Sir...

1102
01:09:30,496 --> 01:09:31,576
Tea!

1103
01:09:36,176 --> 01:09:38,856
Books on Urdu and Hindi...

1104
01:09:38,936 --> 01:09:41,776
Books on poetry and stories...

1105
01:09:43,136 --> 01:09:45,536
Books on poetry and stories...

1106
01:09:45,616 --> 01:09:47,936
Books on unique thoughts,
unique feelings.

1107
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:51,096
Books on poetry and stories...

1108
01:09:59,173 --> 01:10:00,673
Habib sir...

1109
01:10:02,562 --> 01:10:06,602
These days Hindi and Urdu books are
only sold at the railway stations.

1110
01:10:06,682 --> 01:10:08,202
People keep it if
you give it for free.

1111
01:10:08,242 --> 01:10:09,722
And later throw it away.

1112
01:10:09,802 --> 01:10:11,482
But no one reads them.

1113
01:10:11,562 --> 01:10:16,522
That's why we try to sell
these books, in one way or another.

1114
01:10:17,162 --> 01:10:20,802
It's a small effort
to keep the languages alive.

1115
01:10:21,322 --> 01:10:23,642
And it always provides
us with a square meal.

1116
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:26,362
The Hindi films and serials
have revived the language.

1117
01:10:26,642 --> 01:10:29,482
Otherwise, the day poverty
is eradicated from India...

1118
01:10:29,863 --> 01:10:31,651
...so will the Indians.

1119
01:10:31,985 --> 01:10:34,762
You look educated.
- Just a little.

1120
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:36,962
Actually... we're in
search of a teacher...

1121
01:10:37,042 --> 01:10:40,762
...who can explain us
the beauty of this language.

1122
01:10:41,873 --> 01:10:44,282
We've heard a lot about.

1123
01:10:44,445 --> 01:10:46,746
Coincidentally... we also
got meet you in person.

1124
01:10:49,723 --> 01:10:52,962
We were looking for a shop
and a place to stay, on rent.

1125
01:10:53,241 --> 01:10:57,362
If you could bless us with your
grace... we would be really fortunate.

1126
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,922
Don't you dare think
of withdrawing your security!

1127
01:11:05,126 --> 01:11:07,286
What did I get by
marrying a puncture-fixer?

1128
01:11:07,326 --> 01:11:10,126
Now that the neighborhood women
are giving me importance...

1129
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:11,686
...after so many years
you're feeling jealous?

1130
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:15,606
Moreover, our house has
become a tourist attraction.

1131
01:11:15,686 --> 01:11:17,966
People get their pictures taken.

1132
01:11:18,046 --> 01:11:20,058
If we lose all this,
Who will respect me anymore?

1133
01:11:20,138 --> 01:11:21,286
In fact, people are waiting to see...

1134
01:11:21,326 --> 01:11:22,446
...when our security is withdrawn.

1135
01:11:22,594 --> 01:11:24,809
The other Khadims are
waiting with bated breath

1136
01:11:27,006 --> 01:11:28,286
At least now I can
sleep without a worry...

1137
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:29,766
...knowing that my
husband's under watch.

1138
01:11:29,846 --> 01:11:31,326
Otherwise... who knows where you go...

1139
01:11:31,406 --> 01:11:33,446
...under the pretext
of your day-night service.

1140
01:11:33,886 --> 01:11:35,966
What's your problem with security?

1141
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:39,926
Books on Urdu and Hindi

1142
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,606
Books on poetry and stories...

1143
01:11:43,046 --> 01:11:44,722
Hello.
- Munna, what's the news?

1144
01:11:44,802 --> 01:11:45,966
Did you find a place to stay?
- Yes, boss.

1145
01:11:46,006 --> 01:11:47,166
Fate is with us.

1146
01:11:47,246 --> 01:11:48,646
We found a place in his neighborhood.

1147
01:11:48,686 --> 01:11:51,286
Grace of God,
finish your job quickly.

1148
01:11:51,406 --> 01:11:53,766
I'm drafting letters
for the television channels.

1149
01:11:53,886 --> 01:11:55,846
There's a small problem.
- What?

1150
01:11:55,926 --> 01:11:57,301
The security is really tight.

1151
01:11:57,381 --> 01:11:59,606
They have huge commandoes on guard.

1152
01:11:59,686 --> 01:12:02,886
You've killed 20 until
now... this will be the 21 st.

1153
01:12:03,006 --> 01:12:04,766
Film-makers will
make a biopic on you.

1154
01:12:04,956 --> 01:12:07,756
21 Still Going Strong... They
don't have any more stories left.

1155
01:12:07,796 --> 01:12:09,956
Boss, this time it's
going to cost more.

1156
01:12:10,476 --> 01:12:13,636
Hello. Hello... hello...

1157
01:12:14,356 --> 01:12:16,316
Rascal won't hear a thing now.

1158
01:12:22,236 --> 01:12:23,316
Hello...

1159
01:12:31,898 --> 01:12:33,298
Hello, Inspector.

1160
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:35,258
I am your neighbor too.

1161
01:12:35,338 --> 01:12:37,418
Why don't you pay
me a visit sometime?

1162
01:12:37,498 --> 01:12:40,978
I am sure you like poetry.

1163
01:12:41,058 --> 01:12:43,178
I don't like to waste my time.

1164
01:12:43,658 --> 01:12:45,218
Let us do our duty.

1165
01:12:51,218 --> 01:12:53,578
The police have released
Fauzia's brothers.

1166
01:12:54,898 --> 01:12:57,018
Until now they would
get rent from two shops.

1167
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,098
But now they've two tenants as well.

1168
01:12:59,858 --> 01:13:01,618
And they're always staring at us.

1169
01:13:01,658 --> 01:13:03,578
I think they have wrong intentions.

1170
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:09,098
We've armed guards
stationed outside our house.

1171
01:13:09,138 --> 01:13:12,218
Who would dare to
harm us in any manner?

1172
01:13:12,384 --> 01:13:13,418
Who wants to die?

1173
01:13:15,818 --> 01:13:19,818
Pakistan needs a run-rate
of 8.5 per over...

1174
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:24,338
And that's a beautiful
stroke towards the onside.

1175
01:13:24,418 --> 01:13:28,978
And Afridi's on strike once again...

1176
01:13:29,058 --> 01:13:31,738
...and this is exactly
what India didn't want.

1177
01:13:32,427 --> 01:13:34,738
Sir...
- Please be seated, inspector.

1178
01:13:38,316 --> 01:13:41,258
Would you like a small one?
- No, no.

1179
01:13:41,829 --> 01:13:44,509
I am a spiritual man.
It's forbidden for us.

1180
01:13:44,749 --> 01:13:46,069
You can carry on.

1181
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:47,669
Everything's allowed these days.

1182
01:13:47,749 --> 01:13:50,669
Yes, but until I
manage to stay away...

1183
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:53,069
...I won't be afraid to face Allah.

1184
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:56,269
We're soldiers, sir...

1185
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:00,789
If we don't look the
other way... we miss our family.

1186
01:14:01,149 --> 01:14:04,429
This is more of an antidote for us.

1187
01:14:04,866 --> 01:14:08,149
Inspector, I have a small request.

1188
01:14:08,709 --> 01:14:09,749
Please.

1189
01:14:10,309 --> 01:14:14,229
Please let me go
out alone once a day.

1190
01:14:14,429 --> 01:14:16,269
I've an important
matter to attend to.

1191
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:20,869
That's not possible, sir.

1192
01:14:21,269 --> 01:14:24,109
We'll lose our jobs.
- It'll be absolutely alright.

1193
01:14:24,189 --> 01:14:26,709
Just give the orders, sir. Your
entire security will go with you.

1194
01:14:26,789 --> 01:14:31,989
There are some places where... I
can't take all of you along.

1195
01:14:33,896 --> 01:14:37,149
What place is that, sir?
I would like to know.

1196
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:41,309
Look... you're like
a brother to Hamida.

1197
01:14:42,248 --> 01:14:44,909
You'll have to keep this a secret.

1198
01:14:46,921 --> 01:14:49,001
I have... a sweetheart.

1199
01:14:49,921 --> 01:14:52,321
But since you've put
my house under watch...

1200
01:14:52,361 --> 01:14:54,161
...I can't go see her.

1201
01:14:54,241 --> 01:14:56,001
And she's angry with me.

1202
01:14:56,721 --> 01:14:57,921
You're such a rascal.

1203
01:14:58,001 --> 01:15:03,161
Well... would you miss
an opportunity like this?

1204
01:15:04,761 --> 01:15:05,761
Tell me. Tell me.

1205
01:15:06,681 --> 01:15:07,721
No, sir.

1206
01:15:08,641 --> 01:15:12,241
According to our secret
report... your life is in danger.

1207
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:14,281
You can take a guard along.

1208
01:15:14,361 --> 01:15:17,041
Oh come on... You and
your secret reports.

1209
01:15:17,121 --> 01:15:18,561
Nothing's going to happen.

1210
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:21,641
Even I know a little
about politics now.

1211
01:15:28,721 --> 01:15:31,481
This will stay between you and me.

1212
01:15:34,801 --> 01:15:36,241
You will jump from the rear wall.

1213
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:39,481
If something goes wrong...

1214
01:15:40,281 --> 01:15:41,761
...then, you will
be solely responsible.

1215
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:44,401
I'll do as you say.

1216
01:15:44,681 --> 01:15:47,721
Just handle... her.

1217
01:15:54,343 --> 01:15:57,703
Boss... this job is
getting more difficult.

1218
01:15:57,783 --> 01:15:59,183
Babu's keeping an eye on him.

1219
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:00,743
The security is on high alert.

1220
01:16:00,903 --> 01:16:03,103
They even check cycles
before he can fix them.

1221
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:04,903
Boss, what if I plant
a bomb in a cycle...

1222
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:06,463
or kill him in his house?

1223
01:16:06,983 --> 01:16:09,343
Keep a cool head.

1224
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:12,743
We can't afford to make any mistakes.

1225
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:14,623
Babu is new to this job.

1226
01:16:14,663 --> 01:16:16,543
Don't let him use any firearm.

1227
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:19,063
Just tell him to keep
a watch on the target.

1228
01:16:19,383 --> 01:16:21,663
How will I learn
if you don't let me shoot.

1229
01:16:21,943 --> 01:16:23,183
Give me a chance this time.

1230
01:16:23,223 --> 01:16:27,263
Bullets are expensive,
and life is cheap.

1231
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:31,023
But I will give you
a chance... one day.

1232
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,296
Rascal... never says
a word about the money.

1233
01:16:57,703 --> 01:16:58,383
Munna...

1234
01:16:58,423 --> 01:16:59,423
Munna...

1235
01:17:07,758 --> 01:17:09,087
There was on banyan tree.

1236
01:17:09,516 --> 01:17:10,598
150 years old.

1237
01:17:10,813 --> 01:17:12,270
Ghost used to live there.

1238
01:17:19,137 --> 01:17:20,924
Who dare to go,
fear of them.

1239
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:45,490
Sayeeda, open the door.

1240
01:18:06,105 --> 01:18:09,330
Believe me, sweetheart.
I meet with Dixit.

1241
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:12,810
Soon my security will be withdrawn.

1242
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,330
Then we can meet whenever we want.

1243
01:18:15,488 --> 01:18:16,890
This security will be withdrawn...

1244
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:18,989
...but, what about the other security?
- Other security?

1245
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:20,723
Who?
- Hamida.

1246
01:18:20,971 --> 01:18:22,673
That's exactly what
I am afraid about.

1247
01:18:22,713 --> 01:18:23,923
She sleeps peacefully now.

1248
01:18:24,003 --> 01:18:25,478
But the day my
security is withdrawn...

1249
01:18:25,518 --> 01:18:26,723
...I'll be in trouble.

1250
01:18:26,883 --> 01:18:30,523
Why don't you marry me?
- Ty to understand, sweetheart.

1251
01:18:30,763 --> 01:18:34,403
These secret meetings
are way more fun than marriage.

1252
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:35,963
Will you be honest with me?

1253
01:18:36,363 --> 01:18:39,683
Do you really love me or... is this
Just a fling for you.

1254
01:18:39,763 --> 01:18:41,403
What are you saying, Sayeeda?

1255
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:42,643
I wouldn't have taken
all this trouble...

1256
01:18:42,723 --> 01:18:44,123
...to meet you, if I didn't love you.

1257
01:18:44,203 --> 01:18:46,523
That's what all the
men in the world say.

1258
01:18:46,803 --> 01:18:48,923
I love you, Aslam.

1259
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,603
I am scared of loneliness now.

1260
01:18:52,003 --> 01:18:53,523
I want to live with you.

1261
01:19:03,283 --> 01:19:06,683
Be patient, Sayeeda.
Your dreams will come true.

1262
01:19:06,763 --> 01:19:08,203
Can I ask you something?

1263
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:10,083
Yes.

1264
01:19:10,584 --> 01:19:12,603
Do you like Hameeda or me?

1265
01:19:13,786 --> 01:19:16,483
What kind of a question is that?
- Just answer me.

1266
01:19:18,243 --> 01:19:19,643
I have never given it a thought.

1267
01:19:21,503 --> 01:19:24,283
You're a liar
cheat, deceit... I don! 't trust...

1268
01:20:07,923 --> 01:20:09,763
Please forgive my sin!

1269
01:20:22,904 --> 01:20:24,803
Aslam sir!

1270
01:20:25,518 --> 01:20:29,238
I told you your life's in danger.
- Save me.

1271
01:20:35,262 --> 01:20:36,227
Sir.

1272
01:20:36,267 --> 01:20:37,838
Ravi.
- Yes, sir.

1273
01:20:37,918 --> 01:20:38,918
Don't speak.

1274
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:41,198
VIP's been attacked.
- What?

1275
01:20:44,327 --> 01:20:45,327
Munna...

1276
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:46,466
Munna...

1277
01:20:46,998 --> 01:20:47,718
Munna...

1278
01:20:47,758 --> 01:20:49,638
Some other gang shot the Khadim.

1279
01:20:50,598 --> 01:20:51,598
What?

1280
01:20:51,798 --> 01:20:54,758
Someone shot him before us.

1281
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:56,798
The a^^^

1282
01:20:57,687 --> 01:20:59,198
Is this how you trained, Babu?

1283
01:20:59,518 --> 01:21:00,958
I apologies, boss.

1284
01:21:01,117 --> 01:21:02,637
Is he alive or dead?

1285
01:21:03,277 --> 01:21:04,517
I don't know.

1286
01:21:04,597 --> 01:21:07,837
If he's alive, then don't
come back without killing him.

1287
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:10,397
And if he's dead,
don't come back ever.

1288
01:21:10,837 --> 01:21:12,157
Is it bad news?

1289
01:21:14,232 --> 01:21:15,717
How can we do business like this?

1290
01:21:26,997 --> 01:21:29,875
Sir... Khadim sir has been attacked.

1291
01:21:29,915 --> 01:21:32,037
I see.
- We need to lodge an FIR.

1292
01:21:32,237 --> 01:21:34,477
Was his security asleep, the a^^^^^!

1293
01:21:35,077 --> 01:21:37,397
Aslam sir wanted some fresh air.

1294
01:21:39,117 --> 01:21:41,717
So we took him for
a ride in our jeep.

1295
01:21:42,118 --> 01:21:45,277
He sat near BBC's shop for a while,
in the open air.

1296
01:21:45,933 --> 01:21:50,597
On our way back,
he requested to pee in the open.

1297
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:54,957
No VIP has ever made
such a request before.

1298
01:21:55,517 --> 01:21:58,637
So some of our soldiers
stood beside him.

1299
01:21:58,917 --> 01:22:01,477
A man can't pee If you
stand too close to him...

1300
01:22:01,637 --> 01:22:03,277
...while he is peeing.

1301
01:22:03,717 --> 01:22:07,197
So he asked our soldiers
to stand at a distance.

1302
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:09,116
And they took positions
at a distance.

1303
01:22:09,806 --> 01:22:11,037
I was standing close to my jeep...

1304
01:22:11,077 --> 01:22:12,757
...and keeping an eye on Aslam sir.

1305
01:22:12,942 --> 01:22:15,422
Just then two men
approached on a bike...

1306
01:22:15,502 --> 01:22:17,622
...and fired on Aslam sir.

1307
01:22:17,982 --> 01:22:19,382
The bullet hit his leg.

1308
01:22:19,942 --> 01:22:21,862
The assailants fired again, but...

1309
01:22:21,982 --> 01:22:25,182
...our commandoes had
already covered Aslam sir.

1310
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:27,007
Jai Hind, sir!

1311
01:22:27,515 --> 01:22:28,742
Sir! Jai Hind, sir.

1312
01:22:29,542 --> 01:22:31,382
How's Aslam sir? - He's much better.

1313
01:22:31,944 --> 01:22:35,142
Terrorists are freely
roaming in the state.

1314
01:22:35,502 --> 01:22:37,662
Targeting common men.

1315
01:22:37,942 --> 01:22:39,342
The Chief Minister is silent.

1316
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:40,582
The Government is silent.

1317
01:22:40,702 --> 01:22:42,782
The protectors of
Justice are silent.

1318
01:22:42,822 --> 01:22:45,022
You failed to kill the assailants...

1319
01:22:45,222 --> 01:22:46,782
...even with your modern weapons.

1320
01:22:46,822 --> 01:22:51,542
Look... our first responsibility
is to save the VIP's life.

1321
01:22:52,128 --> 01:22:54,622
Killing or sparing the assailant
is the government's job.

1322
01:22:54,702 --> 01:22:58,222
The entire state and the county
is praying for the Khadim.

1323
01:22:58,542 --> 01:23:00,742
If you want to pray for him as well...

1324
01:23:00,822 --> 01:23:04,622
...then text us on 636359.

1325
01:23:05,342 --> 01:23:07,982
Your Excellency... they have
turned the Khadim into a hero.

1326
01:23:08,127 --> 01:23:10,287
It's the media's job and
compulsion to make heroes...

1327
01:23:10,647 --> 01:23:13,327
...our of ordinary people.

1328
01:23:15,047 --> 01:23:16,687
That's all for today.

1329
01:23:19,407 --> 01:23:20,247
Yes, Excellency.

1330
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:23,807
I've found the face the party needed.

1331
01:23:40,721 --> 01:23:43,768
Sir, sir! Excuse me, sir!
- Stop!

1332
01:23:44,162 --> 01:23:45,647
What is the government doing?

1333
01:23:46,807 --> 01:23:48,647
The government has given
orders for an investigation.

1334
01:23:48,727 --> 01:23:51,247
Will you visit the
shrine as well, sir?

1335
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:53,850
Hello, sir.
- Come, please come, sir.

1336
01:23:56,859 --> 01:23:59,047
The Khadim's wife, sir.
- Hello.

1337
01:24:07,032 --> 01:24:08,992
No, no... get some rest.

1338
01:24:09,072 --> 01:24:11,303
I promise you, Khadim sir.

1339
01:24:11,502 --> 01:24:14,152
I will protect you at any cost.

1340
01:24:14,712 --> 01:24:18,112
My government won't
spare the culprits.

1341
01:24:19,352 --> 01:24:21,552
Your assailants will
soon be behind bars.

1342
01:24:21,752 --> 01:24:25,192
If you need anything, call me.

1343
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:27,992
Mr. Lalit will keep enquiring
about your wellbeing

1344
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:29,158
Sir...

1345
01:24:29,684 --> 01:24:33,312
I will pray to the Prophet
for your good health.

1346
01:24:33,592 --> 01:24:35,792
F^^k man, Fatehpur has become famous.

1347
01:24:35,832 --> 01:24:37,072
Even the Chief Minister came here...

1348
01:24:37,152 --> 01:24:39,512
...and paid his
respects at the shrine.

1349
01:24:39,965 --> 01:24:43,605
Even he will give something,
right Habib sir.

1350
01:24:43,685 --> 01:24:45,925
When God becomes generous,
even fools get lucky.

1351
01:24:46,605 --> 01:24:49,445
Why don't you pray to the Prophet...

1352
01:24:49,565 --> 01:24:51,085
...that he makes you a fool too?

1353
01:24:56,285 --> 01:24:58,205
Aslam has returned from the hospital.

1354
01:24:59,085 --> 01:25:00,085
What do you expect me to do?

1355
01:25:00,285 --> 01:25:02,565
Dance... light firecrackers?

1356
01:25:04,085 --> 01:25:07,525
Damn terrorists, they can't
even aim straight these days.

1357
01:25:07,765 --> 01:25:08,925
Talk some sense.

1358
01:25:09,445 --> 01:25:12,045
Why can't you go see him once?

1359
01:25:12,165 --> 01:25:14,205
You can certainly go
if you sympathies with him.

1360
01:25:15,365 --> 01:25:17,285
But I won't even attend his funeral.

1361
01:25:22,165 --> 01:25:23,165
What are you thinking?

1362
01:25:24,885 --> 01:25:28,085
I was wondering was it
Habib who ordered this hit on me.

1363
01:25:28,947 --> 01:25:29,947
No.

1364
01:25:31,265 --> 01:25:33,765
The relationship between
the two of you is haywire

1365
01:25:34,085 --> 01:25:35,525
But it's not severed.

1366
01:25:36,636 --> 01:25:38,805
Otherwise he would've remained calm.

1367
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:42,845
Remember,
every time he wrote a poetry...

1368
01:25:42,925 --> 01:25:44,965
...he would read it out to you first.

1369
01:25:46,278 --> 01:25:49,725
And he's taken more joyrides
as a pillion on your scooter than me.

1370
01:25:50,473 --> 01:25:54,353
He and Fauzia raised Rafiq.

1371
01:25:54,633 --> 01:25:57,433
Fauzia's brothers... - What nonsense
is going on in your mind?

1372
01:25:58,113 --> 01:25:59,073
There's a big difference between...

1373
01:25:59,113 --> 01:26:00,713
...having a spat and killing someone.

1374
01:26:00,793 --> 01:26:03,553
You should be thankful
to Rajesh that he saved you.

1375
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,633
So who fired at me?

1376
01:26:05,713 --> 01:26:08,953
Rajesh was saying... terrorists
become famous...

1377
01:26:09,073 --> 01:26:11,633
...by killing important people.

1378
01:26:15,273 --> 01:26:16,273
You?

1379
01:26:18,993 --> 01:26:20,953
The Prophet beckoned,
and I couldn't resist.

1380
01:26:27,553 --> 01:26:29,473
I prayed to the Prophet for you.

1381
01:26:37,682 --> 01:26:39,953
The Prime Minister is
concerned about you.

1382
01:26:40,322 --> 01:26:42,833
You don't just belong
to Fatehpur now.

1383
01:26:43,793 --> 01:26:44,913
The entire county loves you.

1384
01:26:44,993 --> 01:26:46,913
It's the effect of your prayers.

1385
01:26:47,033 --> 01:26:51,953
And so... you've to be
careful at every step now.

1386
01:26:53,513 --> 01:26:56,273
The county and the Prime
Minister have many enemies.

1387
01:26:57,233 --> 01:27:00,393
They are your enemies as well.
- I can clearly see that.

1388
01:27:09,873 --> 01:27:10,993
Jai Hind, sir.

1389
01:27:13,393 --> 01:27:14,753
Hello.

1390
01:27:15,645 --> 01:27:17,125
Hello, Aslam sir.

1391
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:18,285
Hello.

1392
01:27:19,138 --> 01:27:20,138
Give me.

1393
01:27:21,965 --> 01:27:25,645
The Chief Minister wanted
to know about your health.

1394
01:27:29,765 --> 01:27:32,565
We don't want to bother Aslam sir,
so please...

1395
01:27:37,365 --> 01:27:39,205
You know, brother Aslam...

1396
01:27:39,805 --> 01:27:44,445
...that fate gives you
a chance to become a hero.

1397
01:27:44,805 --> 01:27:45,805
Yes.

1398
01:27:46,205 --> 01:27:48,485
The state elections
are arriving soon.

1399
01:27:48,666 --> 01:27:50,365
I do vote, sir.

1400
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:54,434
This time... vote for yourself.

1401
01:27:56,965 --> 01:27:59,405
The Chief Minister wants
you to contest the elections...

1402
01:27:59,485 --> 01:28:02,205
...from Fatehpur, for our party.

1403
01:28:02,285 --> 01:28:04,965
I barely manage
to earn a square meal.

1404
01:28:05,331 --> 01:28:06,771
All I know is to fix punctures.

1405
01:28:06,851 --> 01:28:08,491
What will I do in politics?

1406
01:28:08,571 --> 01:28:10,411
There's not much different between...

1407
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:12,651
...politics and fixing punctures.

1408
01:28:13,411 --> 01:28:17,291
Politics means fixing
the leaks in big plans.

1409
01:28:17,811 --> 01:28:21,571
Sometimes we cause the leak,
and sometimes we fix it.

1410
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:26,051
There's someone like
me in every alley.

1411
01:28:26,411 --> 01:28:29,211
The Chief Minister
can select anyone he wants.

1412
01:28:30,211 --> 01:28:32,611
Don't say that, brother Aslam.

1413
01:28:33,131 --> 01:28:35,754
You're poor... you're a Khadim.

1414
01:28:36,288 --> 01:28:38,051
Your life is in danger.

1415
01:28:38,241 --> 01:28:40,081
You're the media's hero.

1416
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:41,241
Is there anyone greater than you?

1417
01:28:41,321 --> 01:28:42,881
Join hands with us.

1418
01:28:43,081 --> 01:28:45,001
And assure your brethren that...

1419
01:28:45,081 --> 01:28:48,401
...our party isn't against them.
- Sir...

1420
01:28:49,401 --> 01:28:51,441
I don't want to get
sucked into this muck.

1421
01:28:51,521 --> 01:28:52,719
Please forgive me

1422
01:28:53,841 --> 01:28:54,801
Muck?

1423
01:28:54,841 --> 01:28:56,896
This muck consists lots of money and
power...

1424
01:28:57,203 --> 01:28:58,653
and tastes sweeter than honey...

1425
01:28:59,121 --> 01:29:02,521
...and once you step onto it,
people will lick your feet.

1426
01:29:03,761 --> 01:29:08,361
As far as politics is concerned,
nothing is impossible.

1427
01:29:09,961 --> 01:29:13,081
Actors and dancers run the state...

1428
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:15,961
...and pilots run the county.

1429
01:29:16,414 --> 01:29:21,441
And the only condition
is... you need a face...

1430
01:29:22,041 --> 01:29:23,441
An identity.

1431
01:29:24,281 --> 01:29:28,321
Bullets and bombs change
the course of history, Khadim sir.

1432
01:29:29,102 --> 01:29:33,102
Now... you've to decide
what you want to be.

1433
01:29:34,942 --> 01:29:37,822
A Khadim that fixes punctures.

1434
01:29:38,982 --> 01:29:41,022
Or a state minister.

1435
01:29:44,622 --> 01:29:45,622
They...

1436
01:29:46,702 --> 01:29:48,062
They aren't trying to lure you...

1437
01:29:48,142 --> 01:29:49,862
...because of your abilities.

1438
01:29:50,222 --> 01:29:54,462
They need you... because
you're a Muslim.

1439
01:29:54,862 --> 01:29:56,142
I know.

1440
01:29:56,742 --> 01:29:58,542
But what have I got to lose?

1441
01:29:58,942 --> 01:30:01,404
If their party wins,
I'll be a minister.

1442
01:30:02,098 --> 01:30:03,318
I don't know.

1443
01:30:03,862 --> 01:30:05,742
We're already paying
the price of one mess.

1444
01:30:05,822 --> 01:30:07,902
You always think small.

1445
01:30:09,062 --> 01:30:11,942
Is everyone in the Parliament
able... or sophisticated?

1446
01:30:12,502 --> 01:30:14,142
Aren't ignorant and uneducated
people like me there?

1447
01:30:14,222 --> 01:30:16,822
Or are they more ignorant
and illiterate than I am?

1448
01:30:21,075 --> 01:30:24,715
When avarice takes root... it
kills your conscience.

1449
01:30:25,315 --> 01:30:28,995
This bad phase will pass eventually,
but once your intentions...

1450
01:30:29,035 --> 01:30:30,675
I took the bullet!

1451
01:30:31,289 --> 01:30:33,955
I endured the pain. Not you!

1452
01:30:34,315 --> 01:30:37,715
"Life is slippery"

1453
01:30:56,235 --> 01:30:57,595
You won't come with me?

1454
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:09,411
"Life is slippery at every step"

1455
01:31:09,451 --> 01:31:10,431
"Life is slippery"

1456
01:31:10,471 --> 01:31:11,431
"Life is slippery"

1457
01:31:11,471 --> 01:31:13,340
"Life is slippery at every step"

1458
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:14,311
"Life is slippery"

1459
01:31:14,351 --> 01:31:15,551
"Life is slippery"

1460
01:31:15,631 --> 01:31:17,311
"Life is slippery at every step"

1461
01:31:17,351 --> 01:31:21,151
"Listen Ye... It's the truth..."

1462
01:31:21,191 --> 01:31:25,231
"Avarice has taken root."

1463
01:31:25,311 --> 01:31:28,871
"In the courtyard of this world."

1464
01:31:28,991 --> 01:31:36,671
"Life is slippery at every step"

1465
01:31:40,431 --> 01:31:43,951
See that... the party's
given the Khadim a car.

1466
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:46,031
He didn't buy it.

1467
01:31:46,111 --> 01:31:47,511
The Party needs him
so they have given him.

1468
01:31:47,631 --> 01:31:49,591
He'll definitely get
a ministerial post too.

1469
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:51,671
Let him first win the elections.

1470
01:32:04,511 --> 01:32:05,511
Hello.

1471
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:07,391
Where are you, brother Aslam?

1472
01:32:07,471 --> 01:32:08,791
At my puncture shop, sir.

1473
01:32:08,831 --> 01:32:13,071
Get to work...
- That's exactly what I'm doing.

1474
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:15,839
I mean politics.

1475
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:19,119
Meet people... get their work done!

1476
01:32:19,479 --> 01:32:21,879
Cause trouble for some,
and solve other's problems.

1477
01:32:22,107 --> 01:32:24,439
Even stage a protest
march if you need to.

1478
01:32:31,467 --> 01:32:33,359
That's how we'll get our expenses.

1479
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:34,599
Meaning?

1480
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:37,999
Put up your photos with
the PMrCM on the walls.

1481
01:32:40,479 --> 01:32:43,359
Do you have Gandhiii,
Ambedkarji's photos at home?

1482
01:32:44,039 --> 01:32:46,239
No, sir. - Then put some.

1483
01:32:48,559 --> 01:32:49,719
And change your appearance.

1484
01:32:49,799 --> 01:32:52,639
But sir,
where will the money come from?

1485
01:32:52,839 --> 01:32:56,719
Start propagating, and buyers
will lineup at your threshold.

1486
01:32:57,319 --> 01:33:00,999
And remember... no jobs
will be done for free.

1487
01:33:01,559 --> 01:33:02,559
Meaning?

1488
01:33:02,599 --> 01:33:05,279
You ask too many questions.

1489
01:33:05,759 --> 01:33:07,359
Sit in the Party office.

1490
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:09,959
Make frequent trips to Jaipur.
And you will understand everything.

1491
01:33:10,039 --> 01:33:11,119
Yes, sir.

1492
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:14,839
"Listen Ye... It's the truth..."

1493
01:33:14,919 --> 01:33:18,919
"Avarice has taken root."

1494
01:33:19,078 --> 01:33:20,759
Are you planning
to settle down there?

1495
01:33:20,906 --> 01:33:22,626
You can't kill an insect?

1496
01:33:22,706 --> 01:33:25,728
Boss, no one can get close to him.

1497
01:33:25,768 --> 01:33:28,826
Whether anyone does or not,
but you have to.

1498
01:33:28,906 --> 01:33:30,786
Boss... he's got security...

1499
01:33:30,866 --> 01:33:32,986
...and now he's also
dabbling into politics.

1500
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:34,426
What lies?

1501
01:33:34,506 --> 01:33:36,146
The other party shot him.

1502
01:33:36,226 --> 01:33:38,346
What about our honor, if he had died?

1503
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:41,066
Boss... send some money in my account.

1504
01:33:41,146 --> 01:33:43,146
My mother desperately needs money.

1505
01:33:43,226 --> 01:33:44,786
Don't mix emotions with business.

1506
01:33:45,466 --> 01:33:47,906
I'll deposit 10,OOO. Ask
your mother to adjust for few days.

1507
01:33:48,146 --> 01:33:49,390
The Government is keeping
a hawk's eye on our funds

1508
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:50,430
Boss...

1509
01:33:50,558 --> 01:33:51,558
Boss...

1510
01:33:52,048 --> 01:33:54,598
Hello... hello... Boss!

1511
01:33:55,323 --> 01:33:56,678
What the...

1512
01:33:58,611 --> 01:34:01,398
You've waited this long,
so wait until the elections are over.

1513
01:34:01,557 --> 01:34:03,532
Next, you'll ask me to
wait until you become a minister.

1514
01:34:03,572 --> 01:34:05,558
And then, Delhi.

1515
01:34:05,758 --> 01:34:07,838
Life is passing-by, Aslam.

1516
01:34:08,318 --> 01:34:09,398
We'll meet soon.

1517
01:34:11,245 --> 01:34:14,958
"Honest one's honesty slips"

1518
01:34:15,205 --> 01:34:18,798
"Lover's love slip"

1519
01:34:19,072 --> 01:34:21,026
"All are steadfast
in their religion"

1520
01:34:21,066 --> 01:34:24,678
"But slip when offered allurements"

1521
01:34:25,038 --> 01:34:32,998
"Life is slippery at every step"

1522
01:34:47,673 --> 01:34:51,438
Jaipur... Seekar... Jhunjhunu...

1523
01:34:51,718 --> 01:34:54,038
You've no time-table.

1524
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:56,398
Who are you working so hard for?

1525
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,838
I have to go wherever
the party tells me to.

1526
01:34:59,723 --> 01:35:02,203
Since the time of Independence...

1527
01:35:02,243 --> 01:35:04,323
...my party has never won
the elections from Fatehpur.

1528
01:35:05,643 --> 01:35:07,723
I have a huge responsibility
on my shoulders.

1529
01:35:09,443 --> 01:35:13,363
Spare some time for
your wife and kid too.

1530
01:35:13,843 --> 01:35:16,243
You're no longer Aslam,
the puncture fixer's wife.

1531
01:35:16,283 --> 01:35:17,843
Ty to understand, Hameeda.

1532
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:22,849
Hello.

1533
01:35:24,701 --> 01:35:25,963
It's for you.

1534
01:35:26,283 --> 01:35:28,163
Tell him I've stopped
fixing punctures.

1535
01:35:28,403 --> 01:35:30,043
It's a distant relative.

1536
01:35:31,855 --> 01:35:33,599
Greetings!
Greetings!

1537
01:35:35,955 --> 01:35:37,144
Greetings!

1538
01:35:38,225 --> 01:35:39,543
Come on, move, move!

1539
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:44,003
Greetings...

1540
01:35:55,203 --> 01:35:56,283
Welcome.

1541
01:35:56,683 --> 01:35:57,683
Come in.

1542
01:36:06,832 --> 01:36:10,272
However distant,
but we are certainly related.

1543
01:36:11,792 --> 01:36:14,792
We met 3 years ago.
- 5 years ago!

1544
01:36:15,472 --> 01:36:18,952
I was going to hug you
after the prayers, on Eid...

1545
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:21,512
...but you walked away.

1546
01:36:21,992 --> 01:36:23,432
Maybe I didn't recognize you.

1547
01:36:24,432 --> 01:36:25,192
Forget it.

1548
01:36:25,232 --> 01:36:27,512
No need to remember the past.

1549
01:36:27,672 --> 01:36:31,992
So... how's business.

1550
01:36:33,278 --> 01:36:37,272
It's closed. How about you?

1551
01:36:37,874 --> 01:36:40,592
How's your 'money-laundering'
business doing?

1552
01:36:40,632 --> 01:36:42,552
Don't mention that.

1553
01:36:42,632 --> 01:36:44,832
I stopped that a long time ago.

1554
01:36:45,234 --> 01:36:47,032
No respect.

1555
01:36:47,684 --> 01:36:52,352
Now I run the hotel, deal in
property... and education industry.

1556
01:36:53,452 --> 01:36:54,672
What industry?

1557
01:36:55,651 --> 01:36:56,872
We tutor kids.

1558
01:36:57,838 --> 01:36:59,558
I've got schools... colleges.

1559
01:37:00,038 --> 01:37:01,398
It's a pious job.

1560
01:37:02,518 --> 01:37:03,518
Yes.

1561
01:37:04,278 --> 01:37:06,438
So... what can I do for you?

1562
01:37:07,638 --> 01:37:11,358
I have a factory close to Jaipur,
on government land.

1563
01:37:12,078 --> 01:37:13,238
Liquor factory.

1564
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:16,398
I delayed in paying the lease...

1565
01:37:17,158 --> 01:37:20,118
...and the government
revoked my allotment.

1566
01:37:22,065 --> 01:37:27,238
I've heard that... you are
very close to the Chief Minister.

1567
01:37:28,278 --> 01:37:32,798
Liquor in our religion...
...drinking is forbidden...

1568
01:37:33,678 --> 01:37:34,798
Not manufacturing it.

1569
01:37:34,838 --> 01:37:38,838
And anyway,
don't drag religion into business.

1570
01:37:39,678 --> 01:37:42,558
You too are supporting those
who are communal. - Meaning?

1571
01:37:44,606 --> 01:37:45,758
Sectarian

1572
01:37:47,167 --> 01:37:49,718
What are the others?
- Forget it.

1573
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:51,958
You want to contest the elections...

1574
01:37:51,998 --> 01:37:53,598
...and we want to run our business.

1575
01:37:53,678 --> 01:37:56,558
One has to stoop low
in order to progress.

1576
01:37:57,075 --> 01:37:59,475
Whether its business or politics.

1577
01:38:00,435 --> 01:38:04,555
Just name your price
to get the job done.

1578
01:38:31,195 --> 01:38:32,795
Take the money,
the job will be done.

1579
01:38:33,475 --> 01:38:35,035
Should I take the money?

1580
01:38:36,374 --> 01:38:38,035
Why? What's the problem?

1581
01:38:38,253 --> 01:38:40,115
How can I accept bribe?

1582
01:38:41,075 --> 01:38:44,915
What are you made of?

1583
01:38:46,212 --> 01:38:49,315
This is not bribe... it's a fee.

1584
01:38:50,144 --> 01:38:52,624
We're looking after him,
and he's looking after us.

1585
01:38:52,664 --> 01:38:54,224
There's nothing wrong in it.

1586
01:38:54,424 --> 01:38:56,264
That's how the world functions.

1587
01:38:56,664 --> 01:38:59,104
Otherwise, all the teachers
and professors in the world...

1588
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:00,664
...would be contesting the elections.

1589
01:39:05,104 --> 01:39:08,064
Fortune is knocking at your door,
you shouldn't refuse.

1590
01:39:09,104 --> 01:39:10,104
Take it.

1591
01:39:11,784 --> 01:39:13,264
Interesting.

1592
01:39:14,584 --> 01:39:19,144
Khadim sir is contesting
election from Fatehpur. - Yes, sir.

1593
01:39:19,224 --> 01:39:21,504
But why on AGP ticket?

1594
01:39:21,784 --> 01:39:22,864
He will lose.

1595
01:39:23,424 --> 01:39:26,864
You could've asked your coalition
partner to give him a ticket.

1596
01:39:28,224 --> 01:39:32,424
AGP's just playing communal card.

1597
01:39:32,624 --> 01:39:35,904
Oh I see... communal card.

1598
01:39:37,565 --> 01:39:39,685
But his prayer worked for me.

1599
01:39:40,685 --> 01:39:43,085
The Prophet is really magical.

1600
01:39:43,405 --> 01:39:45,045
Send him my best wishes.

1601
01:40:04,005 --> 01:40:05,325
Should I heat up some water?

1602
01:40:06,525 --> 01:40:08,885
No.
I am not in the mood to take a bath.

1603
01:40:10,725 --> 01:40:11,725
Food.

1604
01:40:12,645 --> 01:40:13,645
I already ate.

1605
01:40:14,725 --> 01:40:16,925
A man came on behalf
of brother Shamshad

1606
01:40:17,965 --> 01:40:20,325
He's left a bag.
- Where is it?

1607
01:40:21,165 --> 01:40:23,685
In the cupboard.
- Okay.

1608
01:41:16,485 --> 01:41:17,788
Did you win a lottery...

1609
01:41:17,868 --> 01:41:19,580
...or, have you started gambling?

1610
01:41:20,225 --> 01:41:22,265
Stop asking foolish questions.

1611
01:41:23,105 --> 01:41:25,305
You don't need to sell shoes anymore.

1612
01:41:26,225 --> 01:41:27,865
We'll shut shop after elections.

1613
01:41:29,105 --> 01:41:31,385
I will raise my son selling shoes...

1614
01:41:32,265 --> 01:41:34,505
...but I won't touch
your sinful money.

1615
01:41:36,585 --> 01:41:38,785
My son and I are
not a part of your sins.

1616
01:41:40,745 --> 01:41:42,945
We're finally getting
over our days of poverty...

1617
01:41:43,313 --> 01:41:45,025
...and I appear to
be a criminal to you?

1618
01:41:45,145 --> 01:41:47,145
Wasn't it a crime when
you boasted to everyone...

1619
01:41:47,265 --> 01:41:50,465
...that the Prime Minister has
posted guards at our home?

1620
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:54,430
You don't sell your
sleep to buy a bed.

1621
01:41:55,670 --> 01:41:58,550
It's better late than never.

1622
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:01,790
I am ready to pay for my crimes.

1623
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:05,630
What if you...
- Don't try to educate me...

1624
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:07,310
...about sins and merits, Hamida!

1625
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:09,230
I have that much sense.

1626
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:12,430
You just take care of the home.

1627
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:18,150
Don't underestimate Aslam.

1628
01:42:18,990 --> 01:42:21,510
The Chief Minister
has made a sensible move.

1629
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:24,230
He has nothing to lose.

1630
01:42:24,990 --> 01:42:26,870
He didn't win the
elections last time.

1631
01:42:26,910 --> 01:42:29,150
It won't make a difference
if he doesn't win again.

1632
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:32,901
Sikander sir's been honing
this post for 10 years.

1633
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:35,350
The Chief Minister is
trying to get sympathy votes.

1634
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:38,670
But the masses won't be fooled.

1635
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:43,460
There's no comparison
between a prince... and a pauper.

1636
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:48,580
The elections for the Raiasthan
Parliament have been announced.

1637
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:50,540
Can this government,
that's already facing...

1638
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:53,140
...charges of communalism,
clear the charges?

1639
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:55,500
The Fatehpur seat, which has become
a matter of prestige...

1640
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:56,580
...for the ruling government...

1641
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:58,860
Will the Chief Minister's
clout help save it?

1642
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:02,060
Can Aslam, the puncture-fixer
get to the parliament.

1643
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,660
I'll be bringing you latest
updates on this democratic festival...

1644
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:06,900
...until the new
government's in place.

1645
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:11,300
Sure to win, sure to win,
Aslam Khan is sure to win

1646
01:43:12,166 --> 01:43:15,312
Sure to win, sure to win,
Aslam Khan is sure to win?

1647
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:24,780
Sure to win, sure to win,
Aslam Khan is sure to win?

1648
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:29,100
The pride of the Nation,
Sikandar Khan

1649
01:43:30,694 --> 01:43:33,220
Let see who will win.

1650
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:38,700
Sure to win, sure to win,
Aslam Khan is sure to win

1651
01:43:39,104 --> 01:43:42,100
Sure to win, sure to win,
Aslam Khan is sure to win

1652
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:44,722
Give us your support!

1653
01:43:45,528 --> 01:43:49,180
The pride of the Nation,
Sikandar Khan

1654
01:43:49,558 --> 01:43:52,460
Sure to win,
sure to win,

1655
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:55,820
The pride of the Nation,
Sikandar Khan

1656
01:43:57,234 --> 01:44:01,664
This is attitude.
Cut them by sword.

1657
01:44:39,405 --> 01:44:41,085
This county can never forgive...

1658
01:44:41,165 --> 01:44:44,125
...the murderers of
Godhra and Graham Stein

1659
01:44:44,205 --> 01:44:47,285
Babri's still demanding an answer...

1660
01:44:47,645 --> 01:44:51,605
"Who were the hands... that
demolished her."

1661
01:44:52,045 --> 01:44:55,205
Rioters cannot run the county.

1662
01:44:55,485 --> 01:44:57,578
They set this county ablaze.

1663
01:45:02,085 --> 01:45:06,125
They say our intention
for Kashmir isn't clear.

1664
01:45:06,724 --> 01:45:09,405
Listen to me clearly,
you puncture fixer...

1665
01:45:09,765 --> 01:45:11,525
And our neighbors.

1666
01:45:12,255 --> 01:45:16,045
We cannot compromise on Kashmir.

1667
01:45:16,379 --> 01:45:19,426
Kashmir... is mine!

1668
01:45:22,684 --> 01:45:27,365
Gentlemen... people call
me a puncture-fixer.

1669
01:45:28,817 --> 01:45:30,137
It's true.

1670
01:45:31,537 --> 01:45:34,057
The government schemes
spring many leaks...

1671
01:45:34,097 --> 01:45:37,897
...on their way to
Fatehpur from Delhi.

1672
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:41,257
I... know how to fix those punctures.

1673
01:45:47,177 --> 01:45:48,842
Greetings!

1674
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:52,057
Come on... leave...

1675
01:45:53,776 --> 01:45:57,217
Our politician would be like Aslam.

1676
01:45:57,297 --> 01:45:58,744
Hello. - Aslam.

1677
01:45:59,462 --> 01:46:01,777
The police is taking
me in for questioning.

1678
01:46:01,857 --> 01:46:04,266
Aslam, bhai. Aslam, bhai.

1679
01:46:04,702 --> 01:46:07,164
Aslam bhai, will win.

1680
01:46:08,137 --> 01:46:09,617
What crime have I committed sir?

1681
01:46:09,737 --> 01:46:13,057
Two senior officers are here from
Jaipur. They want to talk to you.

1682
01:46:13,137 --> 01:46:14,980
Let's go.

1683
01:46:17,510 --> 01:46:19,070
That SP has no right.

1684
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,830
I'll talk to the Chief
Minister right away.

1685
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:23,950
You get to Jaipur right now.

1686
01:46:24,030 --> 01:46:25,630
I'm leaving right now.

1687
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:28,350
Hello, sir.

1688
01:46:30,230 --> 01:46:31,710
We have him in the palm of our hands.

1689
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:33,150
He's coming to meet you.

1690
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:40,390
Ramdeen.
- Yes, sir.

1691
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:42,670
Please release that lady
- Yes, sir.

1692
01:47:17,482 --> 01:47:19,322
No calls for a while

1693
01:47:24,122 --> 01:47:27,962
What's going on, sir?
- Unfortunately...

1694
01:47:28,922 --> 01:47:32,202
And it's happening
during the elections.

1695
01:47:34,002 --> 01:47:36,682
The team investigating
the assault on you...

1696
01:47:37,282 --> 01:47:39,882
...doesn't believe
Inspector Rajesh's story.

1697
01:47:43,762 --> 01:47:47,922
You talked to someone
on the phone a while ago.

1698
01:47:49,402 --> 01:47:51,202
After investigating
with the mobile company...

1699
01:47:51,282 --> 01:47:55,082
...we learnt that the number
belongs to some Sayeeda.

1700
01:47:56,882 --> 01:47:58,162
Who is this Sayeeda?

1701
01:48:01,336 --> 01:48:03,482
I don't want this security, sir.

1702
01:48:04,202 --> 01:48:09,122
I am tired of it.
- I cannot risk your life.

1703
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:12,082
The Prime Minister of the county...

1704
01:48:12,162 --> 01:48:14,762
...was killed by her own security.

1705
01:48:15,482 --> 01:48:18,522
The shooter knew about your movement.

1706
01:48:19,522 --> 01:48:22,482
Maybe... he is keeping a watch on you.

1707
01:48:29,642 --> 01:48:33,162
Withdraw them, sir. Take them back.

1708
01:48:33,802 --> 01:48:38,042
This security is a hoax.

1709
01:48:38,522 --> 01:48:42,213
I was in no danger before
they arrived. - What?

1710
01:48:42,293 --> 01:48:45,642
The Chief Minister is
like your elder brother, Aslam.

1711
01:48:51,422 --> 01:48:53,822
Maybe the Prime Minister is innocent.

1712
01:48:54,462 --> 01:48:56,262
Maybe he's not.

1713
01:48:58,942 --> 01:49:00,422
Save me, sir.

1714
01:49:02,022 --> 01:49:03,382
I am a poor man.

1715
01:49:04,702 --> 01:49:07,022
I will be killed in this game.

1716
01:49:07,262 --> 01:49:09,342
Aslam, my brother.

1717
01:49:09,662 --> 01:49:11,822
I cannot withdraw your security.

1718
01:49:12,782 --> 01:49:14,982
Only the Prime Minister can do that.

1719
01:49:16,618 --> 01:49:18,418
Talk to Dixit first.

1720
01:49:18,549 --> 01:49:20,098
Maybe he can find a way.

1721
01:49:21,058 --> 01:49:24,058
Otherwise,
I'll take your voice to the masses...

1722
01:49:24,326 --> 01:49:28,378
...how the Prime Minister
deceived you and the county.

1723
01:49:30,898 --> 01:49:33,898
How can you do this, Dixit?

1724
01:49:34,225 --> 01:49:38,458
I was worried about democracy,
not politics.

1725
01:49:38,858 --> 01:49:45,618
Sir, I thought that you
wanted to appease the minority.

1726
01:49:45,938 --> 01:49:49,018
Now think about nation.

1727
01:49:49,698 --> 01:49:52,458
And accept that it was your mistake.

1728
01:49:53,818 --> 01:49:59,098
I accept it sir, it was my mistake.

1729
01:50:01,658 --> 01:50:04,498
Sir, he's coming.

1730
01:50:06,938 --> 01:50:09,298
Trust me, sir. I'll take care of him.

1731
01:50:09,458 --> 01:50:13,938
I cannot afford one more mistake.

1732
01:50:15,418 --> 01:50:16,578
Sir...

1733
01:50:17,778 --> 01:50:20,338
...I think you should meet him once.

1734
01:50:20,418 --> 01:50:24,698
Why should I meet that stupid man?

1735
01:50:25,418 --> 01:50:26,538
Sir...

1736
01:50:28,778 --> 01:50:32,418
...just make him feel
important. Please.

1737
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,818
Sir, VIP is here.

1738
01:51:12,598 --> 01:51:16,518
How are you, Khadim sir!

1739
01:51:19,878 --> 01:51:22,398
Long live the Prophet.

1740
01:51:22,758 --> 01:51:24,918
It really works.

1741
01:51:25,158 --> 01:51:28,798
Please forgive me sir but
I am fed up of this security.

1742
01:51:28,878 --> 01:51:30,798
I request you to
withdraw my security.

1743
01:51:32,348 --> 01:51:35,468
Dixit, please take
care of Khadim sir.

1744
01:51:35,748 --> 01:51:39,188
And by the way,
good luck for your election.

1745
01:51:45,828 --> 01:51:46,828
Sit.

1746
01:51:52,588 --> 01:51:56,268
The Chief Minister
is not what you think he is.

1747
01:51:58,468 --> 01:51:59,948
He's misleading you.

1748
01:52:00,828 --> 01:52:02,268
Using you.

1749
01:52:02,628 --> 01:52:05,148
This too is due
to your 'benevolence'.

1750
01:52:06,388 --> 01:52:09,748
I didn't tell you to
meet your lover secretly.

1751
01:52:15,834 --> 01:52:18,154
India is a great county, Aslam.

1752
01:52:19,074 --> 01:52:22,194
The Prime Minister
commands great respect.

1753
01:52:22,754 --> 01:52:24,834
If you try to toy around with
it you will be left with nothing.

1754
01:52:25,234 --> 01:52:26,354
What do you want?

1755
01:52:27,314 --> 01:52:29,114
Money? License?

1756
01:52:29,954 --> 01:52:31,874
A seat in the Lower House?
The Parliament?

1757
01:52:33,104 --> 01:52:34,584
You will get what you want.

1758
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:37,024
But you will never admit that...

1759
01:52:37,064 --> 01:52:40,664
...you never received
any threat from Pakistan.

1760
01:52:40,744 --> 01:52:42,544
Please withdraw my security.

1761
01:52:43,624 --> 01:52:45,104
Elections are around the corner.

1762
01:52:45,744 --> 01:52:48,304
I'll have to talk
to your Chief Minister.

1763
01:52:49,064 --> 01:52:52,344
If he agrees,
I will withdraw your security.

1764
01:52:53,624 --> 01:52:54,824
If you win the elections...

1765
01:52:55,104 --> 01:52:57,904
...then, don't forget
to thank your friend.

1766
01:53:10,544 --> 01:53:11,904
You shouldn't have fired at me...

1767
01:53:11,944 --> 01:53:14,424
...in order to save yourself.

1768
01:53:19,942 --> 01:53:21,982
The investigation
isn't over yet, Aslam.

1769
01:53:23,382 --> 01:53:26,302
The pain of the first bullet must
have been excruciating.

1770
01:53:27,502 --> 01:53:31,582
But you might not be able
to endure a second attack.

1771
01:53:39,019 --> 01:53:40,142
Hello sir!

1772
01:53:40,262 --> 01:53:42,542
The common man is worried,
Mr. Chaturvedi

1773
01:53:43,864 --> 01:53:46,702
It's important for us to meet now.

1774
01:53:47,022 --> 01:53:48,702
Just give the orders...

1775
01:53:48,782 --> 01:53:51,382
Do you remember why
you were sent there?

1776
01:53:51,462 --> 01:53:53,161
Yes, boss.
- So then?

1777
01:53:53,742 --> 01:53:55,342
Boss, we didn't get an opportunity.

1778
01:53:55,422 --> 01:53:57,782
He won't walkup to
you and say "Shoot me".

1779
01:53:58,902 --> 01:54:01,142
Boss, we are trying.
- B^^^!

1780
01:54:01,507 --> 01:54:03,542
I haven't written a letter to
a television channel for a long time.

1781
01:54:03,709 --> 01:54:05,069
They must have even
forgotten my name.

1782
01:54:05,109 --> 01:54:06,109
Okay boss.

1783
01:54:06,149 --> 01:54:09,949
Listen, get the job done
in 10 days... or return to the camp.

1784
01:54:10,309 --> 01:54:11,349
I will shoot you myself.

1785
01:54:11,429 --> 01:54:13,829
Boss, we don't have money
to even buy mobile talk-time

1786
01:54:13,949 --> 01:54:15,229
Please send some money.
- Hang up.

1787
01:54:15,349 --> 01:54:16,429
Nonsense...

1788
01:54:17,249 --> 01:54:18,249
Damn.

1789
01:54:19,142 --> 01:54:22,150
The Prime Minister had
made a good move, Mr. Dixit.

1790
01:54:22,309 --> 01:54:26,509
You're taking a big advantage
of our small mistake.

1791
01:54:27,029 --> 01:54:29,626
That's how history is made.

1792
01:54:30,309 --> 01:54:34,229
There can't be a small
price for such a big mistake.

1793
01:54:34,989 --> 01:54:35,989
Go ahead.

1794
01:54:39,349 --> 01:54:41,445
The Chief Minister's
name should be cleared...

1795
01:54:41,669 --> 01:54:43,349
...from the riots case,
before the elections.

1796
01:54:43,429 --> 01:54:45,515
And what will the government
say to the riot victims?

1797
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,257
You've given nothing
but false hopes...

1798
01:54:51,297 --> 01:54:53,859
...to them and the county.

1799
01:54:53,939 --> 01:54:58,019
3G... 4G... 5G... Common Wealth Games,
Mines, Coal...

1800
01:54:58,459 --> 01:54:59,899
You can ask for anything,
Chaturvedi, but...

1801
01:54:59,979 --> 01:55:03,979
We'll have all this if
we're in power, Dixit sir.

1802
01:55:04,899 --> 01:55:06,699
Let's not haggle.

1803
01:55:07,224 --> 01:55:09,019
Let's end this Khadim story.

1804
01:55:09,619 --> 01:55:12,099
We will keep quiet, and so will you.

1805
01:55:19,818 --> 01:55:22,053
I've been calling you for so long,
Mr. Chaturvedi...

1806
01:55:22,093 --> 01:55:23,459
...but you aren't answering my calls.

1807
01:55:23,752 --> 01:55:24,752
What is it?

1808
01:55:24,992 --> 01:55:26,712
Did you talk to the Chief Minister?

1809
01:55:27,432 --> 01:55:29,312
When is he withdrawing my security?
- Ty to understand.

1810
01:55:29,792 --> 01:55:32,632
The Chief Minister has other
important things to attend to.

1811
01:55:32,952 --> 01:55:34,672
What's your problem?

1812
01:55:35,152 --> 01:55:36,432
Don't meet her till the elections.

1813
01:55:37,792 --> 01:55:40,312
And your religion allows
more than one wife, right?

1814
01:55:41,152 --> 01:55:42,672
Control my friend control

1815
01:55:43,552 --> 01:55:47,392
And if you can't,
you can borrow my farmhouse.

1816
01:55:48,312 --> 01:55:49,992
It's a political issue.

1817
01:55:50,272 --> 01:55:52,592
Any haste can
put the party in trouble.

1818
01:55:55,752 --> 01:55:56,752
Hello?

1819
01:56:03,592 --> 01:56:04,592
Hello...

1820
01:56:12,512 --> 01:56:13,512
Here...

1821
01:56:16,397 --> 01:56:19,077
Why is it so silent
around the camp today?

1822
01:56:20,157 --> 01:56:21,837
Brother Rajesh is upset.

1823
01:56:23,157 --> 01:56:24,517
He looks sad.

1824
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:28,797
What's wrong?

1825
01:56:32,517 --> 01:56:34,877
Answer me honestly, Hameeda.

1826
01:56:36,317 --> 01:56:37,597
Are you with me?

1827
01:56:40,498 --> 01:56:42,237
We can discuss this later.

1828
01:56:44,161 --> 01:56:45,317
Can you...

1829
01:56:46,146 --> 01:56:48,437
...be happy the rest of your life...

1830
01:56:50,095 --> 01:56:51,677
...with Aslam, the puncture fixer?

1831
01:56:53,077 --> 01:56:55,277
When I came in this house,
your mother had said...

1832
01:56:55,357 --> 01:56:59,837
"Dear, pray for only
what's rightfully yours."

1833
01:57:02,451 --> 01:57:04,611
"Don't ever set your
eyes on someone else's wealth."

1834
01:57:07,491 --> 01:57:09,651
Poverty isn't a sin.

1835
01:57:34,291 --> 01:57:36,371
O Prophet, forgive my sins.

1836
01:57:41,371 --> 01:57:42,371
Hameeda...

1837
01:57:44,851 --> 01:57:46,651
...I have wronged you.

1838
01:58:05,376 --> 01:58:08,336
Truth is...

1839
01:58:11,136 --> 01:58:16,416
I am faltering... while
speaking the truth today.

1840
01:58:18,536 --> 01:58:20,816
This morning, when I left home...

1841
01:58:22,056 --> 01:58:26,936
...I confessed to my
wife about something...

1842
01:58:27,536 --> 01:58:29,096
...she didn't want to hear.

1843
01:58:33,135 --> 01:58:36,136
O Prophet, give me the
strength to speak the truth.

1844
01:58:38,976 --> 01:58:41,216
I have lied to you all.

1845
01:58:44,270 --> 01:58:47,216
I never received any
threat from Pakistan.

1846
01:58:48,095 --> 01:58:51,896
Aslam, the puncture
fixer... a common man...

1847
01:58:52,341 --> 01:58:57,581
...Khadim for a day,
became a VIP overnight...

1848
01:58:57,861 --> 01:59:01,181
...when the county's Prime Minister
met an ordinary man.

1849
01:59:02,341 --> 01:59:11,101
I complained about my
neighbor in a common man's language.

1850
01:59:12,221 --> 01:59:13,501
But the Prime Minister
doesn't understand...

1851
01:59:13,541 --> 01:59:15,621
...the language of the common man.

1852
01:59:16,381 --> 01:59:20,541
His superior officer
explained him the matter...

1853
01:59:20,621 --> 01:59:23,781
...in the language of the VIPs.

1854
01:59:24,101 --> 01:59:28,501
I was speaking in Hindi,
and he understood English.

1855
01:59:29,347 --> 01:59:32,227
I... complained about my neighbor...

1856
01:59:32,591 --> 01:59:35,267
...and the Prime Minister
misunderstood that for Pakistan.

1857
01:59:36,267 --> 01:59:39,387
In haste I was provided
with Zed Security.

1858
01:59:39,827 --> 01:59:44,307
I got the privilege to push away
people and move ahead, break queues.

1859
01:59:45,171 --> 01:59:49,547
One sinful act got messed up
and another started.

1860
01:59:50,187 --> 01:59:54,587
I... even took the ration
that the security was provided.

1861
01:59:58,083 --> 02:00:02,787
A puncture fixer doesn't have the
audacity to contest the elections.

1862
02:00:03,801 --> 02:00:06,669
A bullet gives you that right.

1863
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:11,640
I am a common man.

1864
02:00:12,731 --> 02:00:19,200
Someone who is scared of the police,
government, inflation and my wife.

1865
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:24,080
I can stand in a queue for hours...

1866
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:26,480
...for kerosene and ration.

1867
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:29,000
I can even pay small bribes.

1868
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:34,880
I can also fool around a bit
like normal Indian husbands...

1869
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:39,920
But I can't betray
anyone's trust anymore.

1870
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:44,280
Not your trust.

1871
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:47,920
Prophet, please forgive me.

1872
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:51,480
Hameeda, please forgive me.

1873
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:55,200
Everyone please forgive me.

1874
02:00:56,165 --> 02:01:01,200
Why would anyone else
pay the price for a common man?

1875
02:01:03,195 --> 02:01:05,160
So I request the Prime Minister...

1876
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:07,287
...to withdraw my
security immediately...

1877
02:01:07,533 --> 02:01:09,493
...and put an end to my plight.

1878
02:01:11,413 --> 02:01:15,773
Don't vote for a
liar and cheat like me.

1879
02:01:18,093 --> 02:01:20,893
You can weigh this
truth the way you want.

1880
02:01:21,173 --> 02:01:22,413
But please spare me.

1881
02:01:25,533 --> 02:01:27,493
I don't want to
contest the elections.

1882
02:01:28,133 --> 02:01:30,533
I don't want to be a Minister.

1883
02:01:31,533 --> 02:01:33,413
I don't want to be a VIP.

1884
02:01:33,653 --> 02:01:38,253
Let me remain Aslam,
the puncture fixer.

1885
02:01:46,628 --> 02:01:49,239
Sir, why didn't
you tell this earlier.

1886
02:01:49,319 --> 02:01:51,973
Move back you all.
- Sir, why are you silent.

1887
02:01:52,053 --> 02:01:53,533
Move. Move.
Move back.

1888
02:01:53,653 --> 02:01:56,173
Move back.
Move.

1889
02:01:56,213 --> 02:01:57,733
Move. Move.

1890
02:01:58,413 --> 02:02:02,333
Look... the Prime Minister
provided security...

1891
02:02:02,953 --> 02:02:05,173
...to the Khadim on
the basis of his complaint.

1892
02:02:05,585 --> 02:02:07,905
It's been revoked forthwith.

1893
02:02:08,145 --> 02:02:11,305
The state government
has nothing to do with this.

1894
02:02:11,665 --> 02:02:15,065
We... investigating the
attack on Khadim sir.

1895
02:02:15,145 --> 02:02:17,265
As soon as we find the assailants...

1896
02:02:17,345 --> 02:02:18,745
...we'll let the county know.

1897
02:04:16,347 --> 02:04:17,467
Hello.

1898
02:04:22,427 --> 02:04:23,787
What are you staring at, BBC?

1899
02:04:24,144 --> 02:04:25,144
Give me betel leaf.

1900
02:04:30,754 --> 02:04:32,947
Don't retreat now, we're with you.

1901
02:04:44,427 --> 02:04:46,468
Glory to...
- Brother Aslam!

1902
02:04:46,508 --> 02:04:48,542
Glory to...
- Brother Aslam!

1903
02:04:48,582 --> 02:04:50,418
Glory to...
- Brother Aslam!

1904
02:04:50,458 --> 02:04:52,147
Glory to...
- Brother Aslam!

1905
02:04:52,227 --> 02:04:54,147
Glory to...
- Brother Aslam!

1906
02:04:54,227 --> 02:04:56,187
Glory to...
- Brother Aslam!

1907
02:04:56,267 --> 02:04:58,187
Glory to...
- Brother Aslam!

1908
02:04:58,267 --> 02:05:00,067
Glory to...
- Brother Aslam!

1909
02:05:00,187 --> 02:05:01,987
Glory to...
- Brother Aslam!

1910
02:05:02,107 --> 02:05:03,987
Glory to...
- Brother Aslam!

1911
02:05:04,027 --> 02:05:06,096
Glory to...
- Brother Aslam!

1912
02:05:07,107 --> 02:05:11,838
I haven't seen any
news for a long time.

1913
02:05:12,302 --> 02:05:14,628
Khadim Aslam's Zed
Security withdrawn.

1914
02:05:14,668 --> 02:05:17,702
I didn't receive any
threats from Pakistan.

1915
02:05:18,022 --> 02:05:20,182
Who was responsible for it?

1916
02:05:21,462 --> 02:05:23,182
His security is out.

1917
02:05:29,142 --> 02:05:33,222
The number you dialed...
- Why isn't he answering the call?

1918
02:05:33,702 --> 02:05:35,102
Isn't his phone charged?

1919
02:05:44,813 --> 02:05:45,920
Them...

1920
02:05:52,302 --> 02:05:54,782
Who is it?
- It's your boss.

1921
02:05:54,862 --> 02:05:56,382
Why is your mobile switched off?

1922
02:05:56,462 --> 02:05:59,942
The plan to kill Khadim is off.
- But he's about to carry out the hit.

1923
02:05:59,982 --> 02:06:02,062
Stop... stop... stop him.

1924
02:06:03,022 --> 02:06:04,902
It's done.
- It's done.

1925
02:06:19,862 --> 02:06:21,702
Stop. Stop.

1926
02:06:22,062 --> 02:06:23,062
Stop.

1927
02:06:24,582 --> 02:06:25,582
Hameeda!

1928
02:06:26,342 --> 02:06:27,342
Hameeda!

1929
02:06:27,622 --> 02:06:28,622
Hameeda!

1930
02:06:28,787 --> 02:06:29,622
Hameeda!

1931
02:06:29,662 --> 02:06:30,937
Brother Habib?

1932
02:06:31,499 --> 02:06:32,739
What's wrong, brother Habib?

1933
02:07:24,339 --> 02:07:25,819
If anything had happened to you...

1934
02:07:27,167 --> 02:07:30,367
...then who would I have fought with?

1935
02:07:31,767 --> 02:07:33,767
We'll resolve the issue of Kashmir...

1936
02:07:35,487 --> 02:07:37,607
...amongst ourselves s^^^^^f^^^^r.

1937
02:07:39,836 --> 02:07:43,967
You haven't given me a ride
on your scooter since a long time.

1938
02:07:45,607 --> 02:07:46,607
Come on...

1939
02:07:48,847 --> 02:07:50,327
Come on, get well soon.

1940
02:07:50,487 --> 02:07:51,947
Where are you, SP?

1941
02:07:52,027 --> 02:07:55,127
I'm hiding in the
jail to escape the media.

1942
02:07:55,487 --> 02:07:58,207
Two tenants are missing
from the Khadim's neighbor's home.

1943
02:07:58,367 --> 02:08:00,047
Should I arrest his neighbor?

1944
02:08:00,087 --> 02:08:02,113
Don't you dare say
a word about neighbors.

1945
02:08:02,193 --> 02:08:05,447
Beware... elections
are around the bend.

1946
02:08:11,047 --> 02:08:13,847
Sir... the state government
has recommended...

1947
02:08:13,927 --> 02:08:16,207
...Zed plus security for you.

1948
02:08:18,412 --> 02:08:19,607
SP sir...

1949
02:08:19,847 --> 02:08:22,438
I can take a bullet for my county...

1950
02:08:23,167 --> 02:08:25,247
...but I won't take Zed plus.

1951
02:08:26,927 --> 02:08:28,087
It's the Chief Minister.

1952
02:08:29,407 --> 02:08:30,367
Hello.

1953
02:08:30,407 --> 02:08:34,247
Congratulations, Aslam.
You won the election.

1954
02:08:34,727 --> 02:08:38,607
The Prime Minister has
given you Zed plus security.

1955
02:08:39,127 --> 02:08:41,487
Congratulations, Khadim sir.

1956
02:08:42,607 --> 02:08:46,007
I wasn't wrong.

1957
02:08:47,021 --> 02:08:50,861
Your life is in danger.

1958
02:08:50,941 --> 02:08:53,701
Accept Zed plus security... please.

1959
02:08:54,661 --> 02:08:56,541
Aslam! Aslam!

1960
02:08:56,581 --> 02:08:57,941
Take it, Aslam.

1961
02:08:58,021 --> 02:08:59,581
Take Zed plus security.

1962
02:08:59,781 --> 02:09:02,741
Aslam sir... take Zed plus security.

1963
02:09:02,821 --> 02:09:04,981
Brother Aslam... take
Zed plus security.

1964
02:09:05,061 --> 02:09:06,501
Brother Aslam... take
Zed plus security.

1965
02:09:06,621 --> 02:09:08,021
Brother Aslam... take
Zed plus security.

1966
02:09:08,061 --> 02:09:10,741
