1
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,290
"This is All India Radio, Bombay."

2
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,702
We will now play some old records for you.

3
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,705
"Ten years ago, these songs
had created a sensation."

4
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,740
"First hear the song, 'Savere, savere..."

5
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,742
Singer Anuradha Rai.

6
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:20,269
O dark youth

7
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,301
Why do you use force with me

8
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,295
"Don't twist my arm, I'll abuse you"

9
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,308
"Move away, O youth"

10
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,338
"I have no friend with me, finding me alone"

11
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:08,624
"It's late, don't stop my way"

12
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,627
O dark youth

13
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,681
"Play your flute, and graze your cows"

14
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:45,296
Don't tease me

15
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,297
O dark youth

16
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,615
Dr. Nirmal Chaudhary.

17
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,215
Hello doctor. - Hello Girdhari. Sit down.

18
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,217
How are you? - I'm fine now.

19
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,224
See! You were unnecessarily worried.

20
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,231
Come here.

21
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,636
"Don't worry, Ghanshyam will be alright."

22
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,670
I have called for the medicine from the city.

23
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,672
It should come today.

24
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,674
"Go home, I'm coming."

25
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,883
"Noming, father. - Hurry!"

26
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,692
"Doctor, I have brought your medicines."

27
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,285
"All of them? - Yes, all of them."

28
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,695
"What medicine, father?"

29
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,502
"This is a small village, many
medicines are not available here."

30
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,702
I had asked Ram Bharose to
bring medicines from the city.

31
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,564
"He has brought them. You
stay here, I'm coming."

32
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,176
Move... move... move...

33
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,626
What is the time? 10:30!

34
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,632
Damn! I missed my train.

35
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:33,237
You broke my hand. You
don't even know to see the time.

36
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,275
"- What are you looking at? - At
Atmaram, the henpecked husband."

37
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,771
See how he is holding his cheek and sighing.

38
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,680
"Do you know, what that
means? His wife has a tooth ache."

39
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,951
"Doctor, I was looking for you."

40
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,291
"Why, what happened? - My
wife has a terrible toothache."

41
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,566
I cannot bear to see her in
pain. Will she survive?

42
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,567
"Yes, she will. No one has died
of toothache until now."

43
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,570
"Go home, I'll get the medicine.
- No, I will come with you."

44
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,566
Or she'll bite my head off.

45
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,606
"One who has a toothache, he cannot bite."

46
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,607
It's a she. - Even a 'she' cannot bite.

47
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,213
Go home.

48
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,216
"Why had Atmaram come? His
wife has a toothache, doesn't she?"

49
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,817
How do you know? - Because
he was sighing in pain.

50
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,294
What do you mean?

51
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,295
Even he suffers what his wife does.

52
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,228
You didn't see him when his wife was in labour.

53
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,229
"His wife was screaming in the room,
& he was screaming outside."

54
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,234
The henpecked husband!

55
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:43,231
"But me? Even if my wife screams
in pain all night, I don't bother."

56
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,243
That's a real man!

57
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,869
What happened to your forehead?

58
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:52,283
I had a tiff in the morning. She
hit me with a spoon.

59
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,683
"Oh, how loving!"

60
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:04,159
"How is my sweet, darling Rani?"

61
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,567
"Father, he talks more than me, doesn't he?"

62
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,896
Is there no cure to chattering?

63
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,604
"If there was, I'd give it to you first."

64
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,233
Hey Chunnu! You came out again?

65
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,760
How many times have I told
you not to come out to play?

66
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,671
I'll complain to your father and
have you beaten today!

67
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,276
"- You have come, doctor?
- Yes. How is Ghanshyam?"

68
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,005
- He still has fever. - He'll be fine.

69
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,677
Medicines has come from the
city. I'll give him an injection.

70
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,219
"You go home, I'm coming. - Yes, go home."

71
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,557
What if someone comes to your house
and gives you an injection?

72
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,653
- Give me your pen. - Why?
What will you do with it?

73
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,753
Give me.

74
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,561
"Kill me if you like, but don't inject me."

75
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,169
I'll be fine.

76
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,172
For God's sake! It will hurt me.

77
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,699
Why are you so afraid? Nothing will happen.

78
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,608
"Don't be afraid, uncle. Nothing will happen."

79
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,612
"Go ahead father, inject him."

80
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,218
Have you finished?

81
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:40,224
"See! I'm not scared. - 
Yes, you are very brave."

82
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:44,423
"Why did he fall sick, father?
- There are many reasons for it."

83
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,632
Is it a bad illness? - All illnesses are bad.

84
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,930
"Don't worry, you'll be fine
soon. Have your medicines regularly."

85
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,669
And eat very light semi solid food.

86
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,004
I'll come and give you an injection everyday.

87
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,248
"Bless you, doctor. - It's okay. Let's go."

88
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,147
"Uncle, won't you give
fees? - Naughty! Come out."

89
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,555
You talk nonsense! Who told you to ask for fees?

90
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,753
"He's a poor man. - Why is man poor, father?"

91
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,560
There are many reasons for it.

92
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,565
Is poverty also an illness?

93
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,570
"Yes dear, poverty is a very bad illness."

94
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:34,268
We have a flat tyre. - What now?

95
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,813
We'll have to walk home.

96
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:40,618
"Ramu, when your brother comes, ask
him to bring my cycle home."

97
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,719
Come doctor. - Has Chunnu come home?

98
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,728
Yes.

99
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,632
I had forbidden you from going out.

100
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,635
How many times have I... - What
do I do? He doesn't listen to me.

101
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,207
"If he doesn't listen, tie
up his hands and legs."

102
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,538
Nhop off his legs. - Shut-up!

103
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,206
Show me your tongue... He
doesn't need an injection.

104
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,646
I'll give you some tablets.

105
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,547
"Give him one tablet in
the morning, and one at night."

106
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,415
"And light food. - No, he won't eat anything."

107
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,149
"He won't eat anything, understand!"

108
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,550
Give him only milk. I'll
come again tomorrow morning.

109
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,704
Tired of walking? - Yes.

110
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:34,670
Shall I carry you?

111
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,367
"Father, is the bag heavy? - Yes."

112
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,577
Give it to me. - Don't bother.

113
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,813
We are very late today. Your
mother will be very angry.

114
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,615
"Father, don't you know mom's name? - I do."

115
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,222
"Do you know your mother's name?
- Yes, her name is Anuradha Rai."

116
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,425
How is that possible? My
name is Nirmal Chaudhary.

117
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,218
So your mother's name is Anuradha Chaudhary.

118
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,425
You are lying!

119
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,963
"Mom's record says, 'singer - Anuradha Rai"'

120
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,894
"Yes, but that was before marriage."

121
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,340
Does the name change after marriage?

122
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,672
Yes. - What will be my name after marriage?

123
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,676
"Will you keep quiet, or just chatter away?"

124
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,678
"Get down, we are home."

125
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,693
Where are you going? - To
give my doll an injection.

126
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,695
She has fever.

127
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,757
You are back? You are very late today.

128
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,294
The cycle got punctured. I
had to come home walking.

129
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,297
Where is Ranu? - Her doll is sick.

130
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,730
She is giving her an injection.

131
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,631
God! She's already into medicines.

132
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,235
I won't send her along with you from tomorrow.

133
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:17,668
"Roaming among the sick, what
if she also falls sick?"

134
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:22,279
"It's nothing like that. Infact,
she'll develop immunity."

135
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,943
Haven't you noticed? The rich fall sick sooner.

136
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,783
The poor don't fall sick often.

137
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,683
"Whatever it may be, I won't let her go."

138
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,348
"I am left alone over here, and you..."

139
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,358
"Mom, I want to go to the
loo. - Go to your father."

140
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,358
Father.

141
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,797
Look at her. The sun has made her
face turn red like a dove.

142
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,301
"Is a dove red? - No, his eyes are red."

143
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:49,706
"Are you a dove? - Not dove, a pigeon."

144
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,340
"You keep quiet! Rani, go to the loo."

145
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,310
Go.

146
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,626
After books again?

147
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,628
I'll try to find out why Ghanshyam
is not getting cured.

148
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:21,238
You cure everyone else. Have you ever
given a thought to my illness?

149
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,869
"Why? What ails you? - Yes, I have no ailment."

150
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:31,680
I am left alone all day. Who
do I talk to? The walls?

151
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,685
"I know. But I'm helpless, my work is such."

152
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,687
Whatever your work. Come
home at 8 tonight atleast.

153
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,294
"It's the ' poonam' festival today, and
the villagers have invited us."

154
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,300
Even I'll get to spend
some time with you that way.

155
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:55,295
"Mom, serve me food, I'm hungry."

156
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,308
Did you wash your hands? - Yes.

157
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,638
"What happened, mom? - Nothing, eat your meal."

158
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,950
You don't know how beautiful you
look in this saree.

159
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,617
"Whoever looks at you, will
not be able to take his eyes off."

160
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,622
What a nice saree this is.

161
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,231
There cannot be a better one. - It's no good.

162
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,630
You call this no good? It looks like the
weaver has put his heart into it.

163
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,237
What!

164
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,676
Do as you please. I'll wait in the car for you.

165
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,644
"Yes, go."

166
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,360
"Nirmal, you? What have you come here for?"

167
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,295
I want to buy some material.
- Do you have a woman with you?

168
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,163
"A sister, wife?"

169
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,230
"I don't have a wife, and never had a sister."

170
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,270
"Honestly, you've been saved. - Why?"

171
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,566
My sister Anuradha...

172
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,606
The one who sings on radio? - Yes.

173
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,609
She is your sister? - Yes.

174
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,941
She is doing a dance drama for
charity day after tomorrow.

175
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,943
She is selecting a saree for it.

176
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,616
But it's two hours and she
hasn't been able to select one saree.

177
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,290
"I selected one for her, but
the way she looked at me..."

178
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,824
that even the sales girl started laughing.

179
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,953
Even you are laughing?

180
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,627
"A man can tolerate being beaten, but
being humiliated before a woman..."

181
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,629
He can never tolerate that.

182
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,961
Do me a favour. - What?

183
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,234
Come.

184
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,673
She's the one.

185
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,554
Nan you show me some good
sarees? - Sure. Select one.

186
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,831
This is a lovely saree. Nan I take this? - Sure.

187
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,606
"I have seen several
sarees, but none like this one."

188
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,604
You like this saree? - Like?

189
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,615
My heart stopped beating looking at it.

190
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,611
"You don't get such sarees
easily. - Sorry sir, your taste..."

191
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,622
"Look, I am an artist, I have
an eye for beautiful things."

192
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:37,227
And can say that the one who
doesn't like this saree is a fool.

193
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,563
"The girl who I have in mind, if
she wears this saree..."

194
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,227
Shall I pack it? - Sure.

195
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,670
What's the price? - Rs.150.

196
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,674
Rs.150? Pack it.

197
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:06,258
"Oh! So Mr. Artist, this was it!"

198
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:11,227
"It's nothing. I wasn't just praising the
saree, I was praising you too."

199
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,161
You don't know how beautiful you
will look in this saree.

200
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:18,259
Whoever sees you in it will
not be able to take his eyes off.

201
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,565
I know why you are praising me so much.

202
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,603
It's a conspiracy between you two.

203
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,606
"Please believe me, I'm not lying."

204
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:30,611
"When I was looking at the
saree, I was imagining you in it."

205
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,238
See! I'm on time.

206
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,241
Shall we go?

207
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,552
"Brothers and sisters, we are
now presenting a dance drama before you."

208
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:18,560
It's named 'Jeevan Sangeet'. It
has been choreographed by Anuradha Rai.

209
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:25,169
The message of 'Jeevan Sangeet' is that
only music can bring joy in life.

210
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,574
Many days ago

211
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,619
In the land of stars

212
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:58,236
"The kingdom of the moon, lived a king"

213
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,542
"His fame had spread far and wide"

214
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:15,153
The queen was as good as the king

215
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:23,559
"She was as beautiful as
she was intelligent and nice"

216
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:31,568
They had a sweet little daughter

217
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:40,176
"She was delicate as a
flower, her name was Phoolkumari"

218
00:19:52,324 --> 00:20:05,226
Evil destiny dealt a cruel blow

219
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:21,277
"It snatched the sweet smile from her lips"

220
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:31,286
Phoolkumari forgot to laugh or smile

221
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:39,735
"Destiny snatched that treasure from her"

222
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:53,351
Listen one and all!

223
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:57,344
"Whoever can make princess Phoolkumari laugh"

224
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,084
"The king will give him half his kingdom"

225
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,623
"And get him married to
his daughter Phoolkumari"

226
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:27,669
"One by one, everyone failed"

227
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:31,672
But Phoolkumari remained unmoved

228
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:38,679
Don't ask...

229
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:46,688
"what the parents were going through"

230
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:52,295
"But who is this? What sound is this?"

231
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,641
With music in our hearts

232
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,243
I have come to sing

233
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:55,283
"The buds bloomed, good days are here!"

234
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:13,167
"Nlouds of sorrow dissipated, a
clear sky opened up"

235
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:21,616
"The sun rays touched every bud lovingly"

236
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,620
"Laugh, dance with joy, happy days are here!"

237
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:34,628
With music in our hearts...

238
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:39,229
"The atmosphere is
lovely, days of union are here"

239
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,625
My beloved has brought music

240
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:06,155
"My heart calls out to
my beloved, it dances with joy"

241
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:16,566
"Our pair is like the moon and the phoenix"

242
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:20,565
"I hide dreams of my beloved in my eyes"

243
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,605
The atmosphere is lovely...

244
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:43,626
"Who I have given my heart
to, may he belong to me"

245
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:54,328
I'll love him day and night

246
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,670
These bonds will never break

247
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:02,142
The atmosphere is lovely...

248
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:09,544
Like their good days returned

249
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:18,553
"May God answer everyone's
prayers, may everyone see good days"

250
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,218
Get water!

251
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,225
Lift her.

252
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,224
Come doctor.

253
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:11,640
What happened to your daughter?
- What happens to all daughters.

254
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,244
"They listen to everyone, but
do what pleases them."

255
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,271
"She participated in a
programme, and broke her leg."

256
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,353
Ayoung doctor has come. He
was giving her an injection.

257
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:26,287
I stopped him. I told him only our
family doctor will treat her.

258
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,354
You did the right thing.

259
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:32,691
Or doctors nowadays give an
injection for everything

260
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,695
Let's see her.

261
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:40,697
"Are you sure there is no fracture? Yes,
even I think it's just a sprain."

262
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,736
"Yet, I wanted to clear my doubt."

263
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,743
Why dear? Went to sing a
song and broke your leg.

264
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,340
"Now when you go to
dance, you'll get a sore throat."

265
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,945
"She actually had a dance show, doctor."

266
00:30:56,454 --> 00:31:00,288
Then it is not her fault. The
floor must be uneven.

267
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,292
"Let me have a look. - It's
nothing sir, just a sprain."

268
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:14,236
"You? Why did you have to call
me if you had called him, Mr. Rai?"

269
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:18,668
You know him? - Only I know him today.

270
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,344
But a day will come when
the whole country will know him.

271
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,677
"Don't embarrass me, sir. You also examine her."

272
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,011
"When you have examined her, I
have no need to examine her."

273
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,014
Take an X-ray if you like. - 
I have already done that.

274
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:35,689
There is no fracture. - 
When did you take the X-ray?

275
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,023
"On the way, while bringing her
home. The report has also come."

276
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:42,696
See that Mr. Rai? I'm not needed here anymore.

277
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,301
Let us oldies go there and...

278
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,308
Nough. We're meeting after a long time.

279
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:57,747
"Sir, I wanted to give her an
injection - Give her 101 injections."

280
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,213
"Even amputate her leg, you have my permission."

281
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,613
"Let's go, Mr. Rai."

282
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:09,284
"Ashit, get an elastic
bandage from the chemist."

283
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,225
I'll get it.

284
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,633
Dr. Kapoor was right. - About what?

285
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,670
"The floor must have been
uneven, or you dance very well."

286
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:30,279
Are you sure he is a good doctor?
- No doctor will praise another.

287
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:35,014
But I am. - Will he take good care of Anu?

288
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:39,686
You are talking of your
daughter? If even I broke my leg...

289
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,691
I'd take treatment from him.

290
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,294
He was a brilliant student.

291
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,366
But he won't succeed in life. - Why?

292
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:56,669
He is very idealistic. He treats the
poor rather than rich patients.

293
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:01,606
"Instead of taking fees, he gives them money."

294
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,205
Give me a cigar. - Yes.

295
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,217
I can't smoke at home because of my wife.

296
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,216
Why? - She doesn't like the smell.

297
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,223
Even your scream is so melodious.

298
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,238
Tell me something. Are you really a doctor?

299
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:33,375
"Dr. Kapoor certified me, yet you have doubts?"

300
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,276
Yes. That day you said you are an artist.

301
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:40,677
"And today, you are acting doctor.
- Nan't an artist be a doctor?"

302
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:46,689
"Until today, I thought Anuradha
Rai is a very big singer on radio."

303
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,283
But today I know that she even dances well.

304
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:55,492
But how did you fall? - Because
of this saree of your choice.

305
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,395
I tripped over it. It's jinxed.

306
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,372
What is jinxed for one can be lucky for another.

307
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,697
What do you mean?

308
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:08,472
"I mean, you cannot move
around because of this saree..."

309
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,604
and I can come home and see you.

310
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,613
"I am in pain, and you are happy?"

311
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:19,415
"My profession is such. People
fall sick, and I make a living."

312
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,216
I'll be going now.

313
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,220
Tell Ashit I'll bandage you in the morning.

314
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,625
Will I be able to sleep at night?

315
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,636
YOU surely will.

316
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,672
I'll come at 10 in the morning.

317
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:04,562
"Madam, the doctor has
come. - Doctor? Nall him in."

318
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,607
Hello. - Hello.

319
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,177
How are you? - I'm fine.

320
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,942
You were going to come at 10.

321
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,615
"Yes, I came early."

322
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,622
I couldn't sleep at night. - Why?

323
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,226
I don't know. I think even I sprained something.

324
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:35,288
"So what? You are a doctor, you
can treat yourself."

325
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,232
"No, I don't have a cure to it."

326
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,240
Do you know what people
will think with your coming early?

327
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,471
I don't mean any such thing.
- Whatever you may mean...

328
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,477
they will say this doctor has no patients.

329
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,687
"I have many patients, but
not someone of my choice."

330
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:04,350
What is your choice of a patient?
- One who is very beautiful.

331
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,557
"One who dances very well, sings very well."

332
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,565
How can you get such a patient on earth?

333
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,172
"You'll have to go to heaven for
that. - Yes, even I think so."

334
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:22,577
"Either I will have to go to heaven, or
heaven will have to come to me."

335
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:42,231
"Come. Come here. - No, I
cannot walk without support."

336
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,633
Trust me... come.

337
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,675
Are you okay?

338
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,280
Will I have to walk like this all my life?

339
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,541
I am not so fortunate.

340
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:04,547
"So doctor, how is your patient?"

341
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,147
See for yourself. She will be able to
walk on her own in a few days.

342
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:13,562
So bring your bill tomorrow and take your fees.

343
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,705
- How regretful. - What happened?

344
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:27,608
"Your leg is fine now. It's true, a
doctor should be a businessman."

345
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:31,406
"So that the patient doesn't recover soon,
the doctor can come every time..."

346
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,613
to hold his legs.

347
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,411
Will you always hold my legs?

348
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:44,218
"Yes, with the hope that I may
be able to hold your hand one day."

349
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,633
You are doing this again?

350
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,829
I think I'll come to know today
why everyone has an upset stomach...

351
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,539
in Neelpur. I think the
cause is this well water.

352
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,805
But you promised to take
me for the ' poonam' festival.

353
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:16,151
"Not today. If I find out today, I'll get
the well closed tomorrow itself."

354
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:21,554
Many lives will be saved.
- Oh. Then I won't stop you.

355
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:28,561
How does this saree look? - It's very pretty.

356
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:33,566
When did you buy it? - Afew days ago.

357
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:38,605
Avendor tricked me into buying it.
- It's not difficult to trick you.

358
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,711
How was I to know? He spoke so sweetly.

359
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,610
I got carried away by his talks.

360
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,615
Now I don't know where he is.

361
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,682
"Anu, will you help me?"

362
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,785
"Yes, tell me. - Heat some water for me."

363
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:27,016
"Alright, I'll get it. How long will you work?"

364
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:31,691
I don't know. Late into the night.
- Then I'll put your beddings here.

365
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:36,298
That music is disturbing me. Nlose your window.

366
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:58,550
"Father, even I'll come with
you. - No, you stay home."

367
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,619
"No, I won't sit at home."

368
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,624
"Speak softly, or your mom will kill me."

369
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,286
"No, I won't stay at home."

370
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,627
Where are your shoes? - Upstairs.

371
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,633
"Damn! Alright, go get them."

372
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:17,332
Listen. Don't wear it in your
feet. It will make noise.

373
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,672
Your mom should not come
to know. - I'm watching.

374
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,676
"No shoes! - Yes, no shoes!"

375
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,679
Go upstairs.

376
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,682
"That is what I was telling
her. I refused to take her..."

377
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:30,685
but she wouldn't budge.

378
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,286
I know! Both of you are cheats!

379
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,952
"Go upstairs, I'll buy vegetables and come."

380
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:47,302
"You did the right thing, landlord."

381
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,298
You stopped food intake on the doctor's advise.

382
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:57,405
Our scriptures say there
are a 125 benefits of fasting.

383
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,609
That is why I have not eaten
a grain of rice since seven days.

384
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:07,617
"Madhav, what have you brought?
- Some sweets and snacks."

385
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,956
"Go and wait at the door, the doctor may come."

386
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:15,822
Eat! Our scriptures say there are
a 125 benefits of fasting.

387
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,631
And a 150 of eating.

388
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:24,672
Wow! - What tasty sweets!

389
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:32,782
This was great! - The samosa is yum!

390
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,683
Eat! And damn the doctor.

391
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:41,690
Are the spices and salt okay? - Yes.

392
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,691
Eat! Eat to your fill.

393
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,696
What are you doing? - The doctor has come.

394
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,697
Hey! Hide it under the bed.

395
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,707
"Hello sir. - Come in doctor, sit down."

396
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,413
"Tell me, how are you feeling?"

397
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:10,210
"There is no improvement. Moreover,
I have to stay hungry."

398
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,212
My system has spoiled.

399
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:19,228
Surprising! The medicines should have helped.

400
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:26,226
Are you fasting? - He
hasn't eaten a grain of rice.

401
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,761
Then why is the medicine not working.

402
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,965
Not eating should have improved his condition.

403
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,240
But I am taking the medicine.

404
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,669
"So you just take the medicine, nothing else."

405
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:38,678
We'll wait for another day or two.

406
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,684
"Good day. - Yes go, your time is precious."

407
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:51,794
"Bring it out, quick! Sorry
Bihari, I forgot to offer you."

408
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,022
"Doesn't matter, I'll eat now."

409
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,695
I have eaten from that plate.

410
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:01,601
What is this? - My stethos...

411
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,577
So you are eating?

412
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,709
Take all this and throw it
away! - Even what's in your mouth.

413
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,946
Don't you care for yourself?

414
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,223
"If not others, atleast take care of yourself."

415
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:26,287
It's not my fault. This idiot forced me to eat.

416
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,627
That's the problem with old employees.

417
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,633
Take it all away! - It's a strange world.

418
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,634
"Some die hungry, and some die of over eating."

419
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,237
Take your treatment from some other doctor.

420
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:43,278
He's angry.

421
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,339
"Alright, I'll stop eating
from tomorrow, but if I die..."

422
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:50,284
he will be blamed for killing me. - Yes.

423
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:03,162
What happened? - My wife sprained her foot.

424
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,595
See! She cannot even walk. Will she survive?

425
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,571
Yes she will. Put a paste
of turmeric on her foot.

426
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,606
"I'll come and look her up later.
- Come soon, or I'll be widowed."

427
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,942
"What nonsense are you talking!
Your wife can be widowed, but not you."

428
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:20,613
"Remember what I told you? - Yes,
to out foot paste on turmeric."

429
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:27,215
"I mean, paste on turmeric, turmeric...
I have understood."

430
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,681
"How is she, doctor? - Why
did you have to call me now?"

431
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,013
You have killed her. - What!!

432
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,219
There is not a drop of blood in her body.

433
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,217
Were you sleeping until now?
- But she doesn't tell me anything.

434
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:04,885
"And then, I am always busy with my work."

435
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,662
Are you so busy that you
cannot even take care of your wife?

436
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,164
Why did you get married?

437
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,599
"What happened, Ranu? - I cut my hand."

438
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,605
Again! - My doll is sick.

439
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,572
I was giving her an injection.

440
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,608
"You are bleeding, and didn't
cry? - I didn't know you were here."

441
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,938
Naughty! Nan't you play any other game?

442
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,408
Always into injection and operation!

443
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,618
Do you want to grow up to be a doctor?

444
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,619
"I will either be a doctor
like father, or sing like you."

445
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:39,218
Like me? What's the use? Who will hear you?

446
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,222
No one listens to your song? I'll listen.

447
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,634
"Sing for me. - No, I
have forgotten how to sing."

448
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:49,269
"Then play the record on which
is written, Anuradha Rai."

449
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:53,241
Even that has been misplaced. - Lies! All lies!

450
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:58,271
"Look, it's here. Play it for me."

451
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,745
You are very stubborn.

452
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,151
Sit and hear the song.

453
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,563
Sit quietly and hear the song. Don't chatter.

454
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:16,654
Doctor! - Are you calling me?

455
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,161
"Oh no! - Tell me, what can I do for you?"

456
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:25,761
What can you do for me? You cannot even
smile on seeing a beautiful girl.

457
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,371
You are laughing!

458
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:32,573
I'd smile if you were
beautiful. - Am I not beautiful?

459
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,611
"You are not beautiful, you are very beautiful."

460
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:40,614
Come.

461
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,946
Why did you come so late today?

462
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,619
I want to talk to you.

463
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,816
Father was discussing my marriage today.

464
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:55,731
Marriage? With whom? - His friend's son.

465
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,231
He's returning after completing his
education in England.

466
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,109
What happened? - I think
what's happening is right.

467
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:13,148
"Who I am, where I have come from, I
haven't told you until today."

468
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,879
I didn't get an opportunity to tell you.

469
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,155
"Is that necessary? - It is, Anu."

470
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:25,890
I come from a village. An
unfortunate village where my mother died...

471
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,560
without anyone attending to her ailment.

472
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,565
Not because we didn't have money.

473
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:34,569
But because there was not a
single doctor for 20 miles.

474
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:40,604
"Since then, my father has
always wanted me to be a doctor..."

475
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:45,213
"practice in the village, cure the villagers."

476
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:49,618
"He was right. - Right
for me, but what about you?"

477
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,221
"What will you do in that backward area,
leaving your comforts behind?"

478
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,622
What about your music? Who will hear you?

479
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:02,230
"You. You are my world, you are my music."

480
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,234
"I will sing for you, I will dance for you."

481
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:12,640
"Anu, think again. Don't be
hasty. - I have decided."

482
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,676
"Your decision has given me new life, Anu."

483
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,281
I was in a dilemma.

484
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,682
"On one hand was my duty, and
the other, my helplessness."

485
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,687
"I knew I would not be able to
live without you, your music, now."

486
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:31,293
But what about your father?
- Don't worry about him.

487
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,492
Oh yes! He was asking about your fees.

488
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,699
"I have treated you, I'll take fees from you."

489
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,899
From me? How?

490
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,531
Sing a song for me. - That's
all? One song will please you?

491
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,938
I have treated you for a whole month.

492
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,241
I will hear your songs for a whole month

493
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,679
"Wonder what dreams my eyes are lost in"

494
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:31,286
"I am awake, my eyes have gone to sleep"

495
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,703
"They have gone crazy, they
are lost in their world"

496
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:59,338
They have become strangers

497
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,614
I am awake...

498
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:36,284
"The heart is happy, the world seems so happy"

499
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:46,692
"My eyes have lit lamps of happiness"

500
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:51,289
I am awake...

501
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:13,619
"My heart fell in love with
someone, he cast a magic spell"

502
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:24,225
The eyes gave me dreams

503
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:28,226
Wonder what dreams...

504
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,017
Deepak! When did you return from England?

505
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:53,488
"Today. You will be happy to know that
I got my degree, and also a job."

506
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,025
That's good.

507
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:59,027
"You may not believe me, but I've been
thinking of you since many days."

508
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,563
About me? Why so?

509
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:05,204
I'll tell you. You have just come. Take rest.

510
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,806
Tell me please.

511
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:14,614
You know your late father was
a very good friend of mine.

512
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:19,618
We had decided to change
our friendship to relationship.

513
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,619
Yes. - That time has come now.

514
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,627
You have grown up. Even
Anu is of marriageable age.

515
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,627
I want you two to get married now.

516
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,903
"If your father was alive, I'd
discuss this with him."

517
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:38,671
"But now, assume I am not
only Anu's, but your father too."

518
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,643
"What are you thinking? - Nothing, uncle."

519
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,680
"I'd consider it my good fortune, but Anu..."

520
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:49,682
Have you asked Anu?

521
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:56,687
Why ask her? I am her father. I
know what is good or bad for her.

522
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:01,228
"Music is Anu's life, and even you like music."

523
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,561
I am sure she will be very happy.

524
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:08,570
If you give your consent...
- Whatever you deem fit.

525
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:12,573
Bless you. This is what I expected of you.

526
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,575
Have you met Anu? - No.

527
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,612
Then go and meet her and
give her this good news.

528
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:20,614
Alright uncle.

529
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,559
"Anu, how are you? - I'm fine. How are you?"

530
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:38,225
"I'm fine. And so happy, that I've
never been this happy before."

531
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,669
"You arrived today? - Not today, just now."

532
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,237
I came here straight from the airport.

533
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:47,241
"Do you know why? To meet you, only you."

534
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:48,641
To hear your voice.

535
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:53,679
I won't ask you to sing now. We
have our whole lives for that.

536
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:59,278
"You'll sing, I'll listen. I'll
listen, you'll sing."

537
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:04,225
How fortunate I am! I got everything in life.

538
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:07,160
"I earned respect, I got my
degree, and also a job."

539
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:11,563
"Only one thing was missing, even
that has been fulfilled today."

540
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,169
Your father has given consent to our marriage.

541
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,605
I think even you won't consider me unworthy.

542
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:24,937
"No Deepak, not you, I am unworthy of you."

543
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:28,216
"What are you saying, Anu! - I'm right."

544
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:30,946
I love someone.

545
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:38,216
You... is that true?

546
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,632
Who is that fortunate man?

547
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:49,631
He's a doctor. I've decided to marry him.

548
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:55,675
Alright. But will you be happy with him?

549
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,243
Yes.

550
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,543
Then I don't want to come in your way.

551
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:06,144
I have just one request.

552
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:12,160
Allow me to tell your father that
I don't want to marry you.

553
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:16,564
Because he is an old fashioned man.

554
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:20,561
He may be very angry with you and say things.

555
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,330
Allow me to bear all that.

556
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,706
"No Deepak, I will tell him this."

557
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:30,609
And bear the consequences.

558
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:33,612
"Only, you forgive me."

559
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,218
"That's not an issue, Anu."

560
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:43,624
"I was happy to get you, but
will now be sad losing you."

561
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,625
But I'm happy because you are happy.

562
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:53,633
"Yes Anu. If ever you need me, just call me."

563
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:58,670
I'll come running. Not just
for the sake of your friendship...

564
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,141
for the sake of friendship with both of you.

565
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:13,552
I am not mad to get you married to Deepak.

566
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,555
"Anu, you are a double graduate."

567
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,558
But are still naive where
the world is concerned.

568
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,163
Do you even understand what marriage means?

569
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:27,168
It is handing over your life to someone forever.

570
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:32,172
"Music is your life, and
only Deepak understands that."

571
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:35,576
"What does the doctor know, who
came to treat you for a few days."

572
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,610
"Besides, you know nothing about him."

573
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:40,210
"I do, father."

574
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:44,214
I don't want to hear a word. Only what
I want will happen in this house!

575
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:48,282
You will have to choose between
this house and that.

576
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:50,621
Father! - Go do you work.

577
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:10,110
"Ramu, you have kept the door open again?"

578
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,543
"Anu, you? What happened?"

579
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:23,149
"I have come to you, forever."

580
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:30,156
"Yes. I'd told you about a boy, remember?"

581
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:33,565
The one who my father wants me to marry.

582
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:37,172
He has come back from abroad.

583
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:42,576
"When I told father about
you, he very clearly told me..."

584
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:47,215
that I'll have to choose between
that home or this.

585
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,619
And you? - I chose this house.

586
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:05,633
I will never forget the honour
you have given me today.

587
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:10,228
I promise I will never
let you regret your decision.

588
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,640
I will treat you well. I will give you all joys.

589
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:20,641
What are you thinking? - What you are thinking.

590
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:27,281
"Nice marriage this was. No
band, no rituals, no relatives."

591
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,476
I didn't have any relatives anyway.

592
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,687
I even lost the ones I had.

593
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:39,293
But I am not thinking about that.

594
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:43,288
I am thinking that this day
is so fortunate for me.

595
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,736
I am so happy. So what if everyone rejected us.

596
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,738
We have accepted each other.

597
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:58,746
"Yes Anu, you are right. Man
creates his own heaven."

598
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:04,217
"His own piece of land, his own sky."

599
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,621
Even we will create our heaven ourselves.

600
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,813
I'll go and get flowers from the bazaar.

601
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:12,624
We will together decorate our bed. You
change your clothes till then.

602
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,631
"And listen. Wear the same saree I'd
seen you in, the first time."

603
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:22,236
And which united us forever.

604
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:20,227
"Wonder what dreams my eyes are lost in"

605
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:24,632
"I am awake, my eyes have gone to sleep"

606
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:45,286
"Mom, father is back!"

607
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,696
Switch this off. The song is over.

608
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,565
"Yes, the song is over."

609
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,616
Come and have dinner. - I'm coming.

610
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:24,625
Ghanshyam's illness is bothering me.

611
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,719
He simply isn't getting cured.

612
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,628
Think of that later. We are hungry. Come!

613
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,632
Why did you snatch the
book? Nan't you see I'm working?

614
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,237
"If you are so hungry, you eat. I'll eat later."

615
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,604
Excuse me. Where does Nirmal Chaudhary live?

616
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,612
Nirmal Chaudhary? - Yes!!

617
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,215
Strange name.

618
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,412
Listen. Have you heard of Nirmal Chaudhary?

619
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:28,615
I am a stranger here.

620
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:30,622
No Nirmal Chaudhary lives here.

621
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:32,624
One Sukhnandanlal lives here.

622
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:37,959
Sukhnandanlal? - Yes! Sukhnandanlal!

623
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,302
What has Sukhnandanlal got
to do with Nirmal Chaudhary.

624
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:42,667
"Well, even he has a stern face like yours."

625
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,003
Even he never laughs. I thought he is your son.

626
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:50,778
How brazen you are! I am asking
for Nirmal Chaudhary who is my son-in-law

627
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,338
He is a doctor. - Doctor! Then say that.

628
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,350
Why are you asking for Nirmal Chaudhary?

629
01:05:56,452 --> 01:06:01,549
"One who doesn't know the
doctor, is either new here, or mad."

630
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:03,555
You... - I am new here.

631
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,228
Where is the doctor? - Do you have to ask?

632
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:12,825
"A doctor will be where there
is uncleanliness, sickness..."

633
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:16,170
What nonsense are you talking! I'm
asking where he lives.

634
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:21,272
Anyone will tell you that. He lives in Nanpada.

635
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:29,614
"See this straight road? Then take a
right, then a right, then a left."

636
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:33,280
"Then? - Ask anyone there, he'll tell you."

637
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:34,287
I'm in a hurry.

638
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,627
"The brazen, impudent man!"

639
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,543
Who is it? Noming!

640
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:07,154
I heard! Don't open now.

641
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:11,556
Open now.

642
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:20,758
Whose daughter are you? - My father's.

643
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:24,602
"That's okay, but what is your father's name?"

644
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:29,539
"You are wearing such think glasses, yet
you didn't see the name plate?"

645
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:34,612
But he won't see you. - Why not?

646
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:38,619
He has gone out. - Oh. Where is your mom?

647
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:43,624
She's gone to the bazaar.
- Bazaar? She has to go to the bazaar?

648
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,422
"If mom doesn't go to the
bazaar, what will we eat?"

649
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:50,290
"She will go to the
bazaar, buy vegetables, cook."

650
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:54,665
"Then father will come. She will fight
with him, then serve him food."

651
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,672
Why do you chatter so much? - I chatter?

652
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:01,106
Ofcourse! Are you sick?

653
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:04,140
"Yes. - Come, I'll check you up."

654
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,546
Sit down. Give me your hand.

655
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:17,157
"God! Your hand is so heavy. Forget it,
father only will examine you."

656
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,558
"What is your name, dear? - Ranu."

657
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:25,359
Ranu? It's such a sweet name.

658
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:29,570
What is your name? - Brijeshwar Prasad Rai.

659
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:32,567
"God! Your hand is heavy, your
name is also heavy."

660
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,174
Don't you find it difficult pronouncing it?

661
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:39,607
I do. - What is your problem?

662
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:43,612
I cannot sleep at night. - Even I cannot.

663
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:49,223
"Chunnu and Meena fight a lot. - 
Chunnu, Meena? Are they your siblings?"

664
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:54,287
"Chunnu is my son, and Meena is my daughter."

665
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:57,627
Is it? Show me. - Sure. Come.

666
01:08:58,734 --> 01:08:59,632
Come.

667
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:03,136
How will I go inside? - Like this.

668
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,303
Like this?

669
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,546
"Look, this is my son, and she is my daughter."

670
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,346
What is this? Who made this? - Mom.

671
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:21,145
It's my grandpa's home. It broke.

672
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,558
What is this? Aflute? - No.

673
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,153
Then? - Hold it to your ear.

674
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,155
Nlose your eyes.

675
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:38,705
"Who are you talking to, Ranu? - To a patient."

676
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:41,275
What patient? - Afat patient.

677
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:43,538
How did he come here? - On his knees.

678
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:48,205
"Father! Come upstairs, father."

679
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:52,209
"Ranu, he's your grandpa Bring him upstairs."

680
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:54,621
"Come grandpa, let's go upstairs. - Sure."

681
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:59,624
You are my grandpa. Come upstairs.

682
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:13,673
"Ranu was right, Anu. I have come
on my knees to apologise."

683
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:15,243
"Don't say that, father."

684
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:21,273
"No dear, when I have been defeated in
life, why not accept the defeat?"

685
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:28,280
You chose your own groom. Your
brother chose a foreign woman for himself.

686
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:33,285
I have realized that my times are over now.

687
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:36,287
These are your times now.

688
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,301
"That is why I have come, to accept you."

689
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:46,297
Where is the question of
accepting? We were always yours.

690
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:50,071
But I want to ask you something.

691
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:52,744
What did you get by marrying Nirmal?

692
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:55,940
You have lost your charm.

693
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,420
You have no good jewelry or clothes to wear.

694
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,616
Nor any servants. You have to
go yourself to buy vegetables too.

695
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,293
What did you get in this deal?

696
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,624
Happiness. - Are you telling the truth?

697
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:11,629
Yes. - Look at me.

698
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:16,637
Accepting someone else's sorrow and happiness...

699
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,671
as your own is one's biggest happiness.

700
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,242
"If that's the case, I
don't want to say anything."

701
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:28,281
You!

702
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:35,289
"Bless you, son. I hope
you are not angry with me."

703
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:40,353
I regret the injustice I have done to you two.

704
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,896
"No father, you were right in your own way."

705
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:46,698
"Anyway, I myself have suffered
enough for my mistake."

706
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:51,305
Take my advise and come and
live in the city now.

707
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:56,339
"Ofcourse, but there is an
epidemic in the village."

708
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:58,335
I cannot come now.

709
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:03,282
"Do one thing. Take Anu
along, I'll follow in a few days."

710
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:07,617
"Alright, Anu can come along.
- How can I come just like that?"

711
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:12,820
He'll be put to trouble. I have
to look after him like a kid.

712
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,627
Why don't you stay here with us?

713
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:21,634
I'll be happy to. But I cannot
keep my bungalow locked.

714
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:26,229
"If you two cannot come, I'll
take Ranu with me."

715
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,640
Then you will surely come.

716
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:34,681
"Father, look! Like you are
my father, he is mom's father."

717
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:41,289
Yes dear. - Mom says he is my grandpa.

718
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:47,353
"Mom, do you love your
father more, or my father?"

719
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,693
"Keep quiet! - Ranu, what's wrong with you?"

720
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:53,290
You are always chattering.
- It is you who chatters.

721
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:56,696
"Come dear. They don't love you, I love you."

722
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:04,805
Then what happened? - The boy screamed...

723
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:08,613
Lion! Help!

724
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:13,618
People came running. But there was
no sign of any lion there.

725
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,219
The boy was laughing.

726
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,216
The people were angry.

727
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:26,631
Do you know what happened
then? A lion actually came.

728
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:33,241
"The boy screamed for help, but
no one came to help him."

729
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,240
The lion roared.

730
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:48,288
I'll tell you the rest in the city. Eat.

731
01:13:56,398 --> 01:14:02,303
"Bless you, son. Anu, try to come soon."

732
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:06,204
"Yes father. Ranu, look
after your grandpa well."

733
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:11,207
"Yes, you look after my father, I'll
look after your father."

734
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:14,612
How much you talk! Don't trouble your grandpa.

735
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:21,212
"Will you write to me? Do
write letters. 1, 2, 3, 4..."

736
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:28,228
It's a foreign country

737
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:32,232
No one asks me how I am

738
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:36,666
"Listen my dear, don't get so tormented"

739
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:59,284
"We had come alone, we will go alone"

740
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:09,160
Life's joys are momentary

741
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:15,607
"Think well before settling down here"

742
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:24,217
Listen my dear...

743
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:43,669
"Love is a sham here, even lovers are fake"

744
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:51,244
"Hearts and dreams have always shattered here"

745
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:57,275
"Don't get too attached, hold yourself"

746
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:05,559
Listen my dear...

747
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:33,619
What happened? Why did you
lower the volume? Didn't like it?

748
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:46,631
Why did you do this? - So that I can see you.

749
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:50,637
It is better if you see the road right now.

750
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:55,672
Don't worry. I will not do anything
by which I will lose you.

751
01:16:57,379 --> 01:17:00,542
"But the way I'm saying this, like
I have already got you."

752
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:07,152
"You don't like me at all, do
you? - It's not that, Seema."

753
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:12,257
"I've lost interest in everything, even myself."

754
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:15,558
But why? I have brought
you so far today to know that.

755
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:20,564
Why are you always so lost? What do you lack?

756
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:27,173
There are such people whose
hearts are shattered.

757
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,175
Who just stop living.

758
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:35,215
Those who spend sleepless nights.

759
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:41,483
You are a strange man. The
more I try to bring you close...

760
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,615
the more distant you become.

761
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,624
And I am even more stranger than you.

762
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:51,231
"The more distant you go, the
more close I get to you."

763
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:56,636
"I was so proud, that I am a rich man daughter."

764
01:17:57,372 --> 01:18:01,536
"I was proud of my culture, my education."

765
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:05,111
But everything crumbled before you.

766
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:12,153
"The moth comes flying so proudly,
and gets burnt in the flame."

767
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:17,157
"Please tell me Deepak, what is your problem?"

768
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,559
What is that pain you cannot get over?

769
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:22,152
Will I have to tell you? - Yes. Right now!

770
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:25,756
"I can get over that pain, but I don't want to."

771
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:28,566
Why? Tell me!

772
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,208
Don't crowd.

773
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:47,618
Ratan. - Yes doctor?

774
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:51,622
The girl is seriously injured. It
is not safe even to move her.

775
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:54,625
Lift her very carefully and take
her to the landlord's house.

776
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,628
Tell him I'll come and perform an operation.

777
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:00,494
You people lift the man and
bring him to my house.

778
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:23,556
Slowly. Over there. In that room.

779
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,559
Put him on the cot. Don't crowd here.

780
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:33,566
Who is he? What happened? - He
was involved in a serious accident

781
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:39,572
He was with a girl in a
car. The car banged into a tree.

782
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:43,175
"The boy is not serious, but
the girl is badly injured."

783
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:46,203
She is at the landlord's
house. - Is her life at risk?

784
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:50,212
"She will survive, but I
will have to operate on her."

785
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,289
"Listen, keep this with you."

786
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:57,221
Give this to him when he regains consciousness.

787
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,289
And call me if you need me.

788
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:00,827
It will take me some hours there.

789
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,328
What a serious accident it was.

790
01:20:10,438 --> 01:20:12,668
"He's okay, but the girl is badly injured."

791
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:28,288
"You all leave, I'll look after him."

792
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,737
"How are you, Deepak?"

793
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:50,308
Who...

794
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:00,817
Don't get up.

795
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:05,623
Seema! Where is Seema?

796
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:09,320
Seema? Oh! The girl who was with you?

797
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:13,231
She is at the landlord's place. My
husband has gone to operate her.

798
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:16,429
"Don't worry, her life is not at risk."

799
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:18,269
Take your medicine.

800
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:26,275
"I still don't believe this,
Anu. Is this true? You..."

801
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:32,479
"When the accident happened, there
was darkness before the eyes."

802
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:35,688
"But when I opened my
eyes, there was brightness."

803
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:39,292
I found you before me.

804
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:42,695
Take this tablet. It's not right
for you to talk too much.

805
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:52,738
"This Seema is your... - No, but she is trying."

806
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:58,401
I thought you must be
married. - No one chose me.

807
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:03,610
Nonsense! Any girl who gets
you will consider herself fortunate.

808
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:08,621
But the one who I'd get and
consider myself fortunate...

809
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:10,814
I didn't get her.

810
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:14,625
Forget all that. How are you?

811
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,628
"I'm fine, and very happy."

812
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:22,633
"I knew no calamity, or
sorrow can come your way."

813
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:25,839
Because you yourself are music.

814
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:29,241
And that's why I could bear
the sorrow of losing you.

815
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:35,678
What I rue now is that I
lost my music along with you.

816
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:41,783
Forever! - See! You are talking again.

817
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:45,690
Nan't you keep quiet for some
time? - On one condition.

818
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:46,892
What?

819
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:48,692
Sing a song for me.

820
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:52,298
"No, I won't let you operate on me over here."

821
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:53,699
Never!

822
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:55,699
Send a telegram to my father.

823
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:57,905
He will bring a surgeon along.

824
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,603
Atelegram has already been sent to your father.

825
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:04,606
It will take several days for
the telegram to reach him.

826
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:08,615
Doesn't matter. Nolonel Trivedi only
will perform the operation.

827
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:13,276
"Look, as a doctor it is my duty to do
the operation on you immediately."

828
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:15,413
A delay may put your life at risk.

829
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:18,822
"No, your performing the
operation will put my life at risk."

830
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:21,955
I'll always have a scar on my face.

831
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,230
I'll never be able to show it to anyone.

832
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,301
Saving your life is more important.

833
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:33,272
I assure you the doctor is an angel.

834
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:36,271
Whatever he does will be in your interest.

835
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:41,340
I don't trust your angel. I won't get
operated by an ordinary doctor.

836
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:43,007
"No dear, such words..."

837
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:46,286
Don't worry. I am used
to hearing patients nonsense.

838
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:50,881
Give me your hand. - You
will do the operation by force?

839
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:52,690
Give me your hand. - No!

840
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:56,296
Hold her hand. - No... no... no!

841
01:23:57,399 --> 01:24:01,165
I won't get the operation done!

842
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:16,616
How are you feeling? - I'm fine. How is Seema?

843
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:19,616
"There is no need to
worry, but it will take time."

844
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,622
She will have to be on bed for
long. - Is she badly injured?

845
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:28,227
"Yes, She has broken three ribs, &
a glass piece has ripped her cheek."

846
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:32,222
She was not ready for
the operation. I had to force her.

847
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:35,628
Her father should be informed. - 
That's been done already.

848
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:41,640
"Do you have any pain anywhere?
- A little, in this arm."

849
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:44,642
Doesn't matter. I'll put in on sling.

850
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,678
"Thank your stars you are safe, or
anything could have happened..."

851
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:48,680
in such an accident.

852
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:52,683
"You must have met her. She
is my wife, Anuradha."

853
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:56,289
"And you are... - Take your medicine, Deepak."

854
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:03,160
You two know each other?
- Much before you got to know her.

855
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:06,156
"That wasn't an accident, this is."

856
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:11,565
"There never was, nor ever can be a
greater fan of her music than me."

857
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:16,403
"Great! I don't have to worry then. You
are not my patient, but my guest."

858
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:21,876
"No, I don't want to be your
guest, send me somewhere else."

859
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:23,284
Why?

860
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:26,217
Your wife is not showing
the hospitality guests should be shown.

861
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:30,213
"I asked her to sing, and she flatly refused."

862
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:34,217
"Anu, that's bad. People
even give their lives for guests."

863
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:36,629
Sing. Even I'll get to hear it.

864
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:37,959
I haven't heard you sing in many days.

865
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,301
"No, I've forgotten all
songs. - Then I'll remind you."

866
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:41,959
Sing that one. - Which one?

867
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:45,237
Wonder what dreams my eyes are lost in.

868
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:49,231
And after that? - After that?

869
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:53,472
"I am awake, but my eyes have gone to sleep."

870
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:56,682
Yes! Right you are. - Then?

871
01:25:57,385 --> 01:26:00,218
"They have gone crazy, they
are lost in their world."

872
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:03,554
They have become strangers

873
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,694
"You remember everything! Anu,
no excuse will be accepted now."

874
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:13,165
"Sing! Deepak, if she has forgotten
anything, you remind her."

875
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:16,567
"Yes, I'll have to do that."

876
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:19,570
Sing Anu.

877
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:25,309
"Not this, I'll sing another song."

878
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:23,869
"How I spend my days, how I spend my nights"

879
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:27,271
My beloved doesn't realise

880
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:50,930
"I regret falling in love with him"

881
01:27:57,038 --> 01:28:01,304
I lie awake all night

882
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:07,912
What I'm going through

883
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:11,918
My beloved doesn't realise...

884
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:34,305
Romantic weather comes and goes

885
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:45,315
All my desires remain unfulfilled

886
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:51,916
Buds crave to bloom

887
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:54,927
My beloved doesn't realise...

888
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:22,854
I don't even like dressing up

889
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:33,858
I have lost interest in everything

890
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:45,869
"What do I say if my friends inquire?"

891
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:49,906
My beloved doesn't realise...

892
01:30:07,635 --> 01:30:11,332
"The same voice, the same melody."

893
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:43,934
What happened? You are an engineer.
How come you became a poet?

894
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:46,529
Come here and sit besides me.

895
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:51,374
I notice you are not giving up that song book.

896
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,712
"See this song. Remember,
you won the music competition..."

897
01:30:57,084 --> 01:30:58,381
when you sang this song.

898
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:03,321
And that cup there. You won that.

899
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:10,328
You sang this song for the All
India music competition.

900
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:12,329
People applauded for a whole five minutes!

901
01:31:13,034 --> 01:31:14,934
I had applauded for six minutes.

902
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:19,939
You sang this song on your birthday.

903
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:24,309
And I had come early morning the
next day to hear it again?

904
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:27,503
You remember everything?!!

905
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:31,917
Nan I ever forget?

906
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,921
These songs became my memories.

907
01:31:36,424 --> 01:31:38,915
I survive on those memories.

908
01:31:40,428 --> 01:31:43,329
"After seeing you I
realized, that even if gold..."

909
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:46,923
"is stuck in the earth for
years, it still shines."

910
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:52,028
"Your voice is still as
melodious, still as magical..."

911
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,539
"hearing which, even the winds stop blowing."

912
01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:58,343
Atraveler changes course.

913
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:04,985
"Good. After 10 years, someone came..."

914
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:08,317
who told me that I can still sing.

915
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,321
I can still cast a spell on someone.

916
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:16,325
Why did you let your talent
go waste? Why did you suppress it?

917
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:21,263
"You loved music, and you worked hard on it."

918
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:23,867
You even tasted success. Then
why did you let it all go?

919
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:27,270
Tell me! Give me an answer if you have one.

920
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:31,908
Don't forget that God has
given life to millions of mites too.

921
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:34,313
But talent only to a few.

922
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:37,907
"By turning away from it, you
are not insulting yourself, but God."

923
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,317
What are you saying!

924
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:43,923
I am doing my duty towards my home.

925
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:49,124
My husband is my God.
- God? I have seen everything.

926
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:52,661
Don't hide anything from me. This
village has a good doctor.

927
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:54,661
But you don't have a good husband.

928
01:32:55,036 --> 01:33:00,269
"Where your duty is concerned, were
you born to do house chores?"

929
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:03,875
"You have a duty towards
everyone, but none towards yourself?"

930
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:09,972
"Anu, you will have to wipe off
the dust on your books..."

931
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:12,416
"your Veena, the rust on your music."

932
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:18,322
"Stop it, Deepak! Stop it!
- No! Anu, nothing is lost yet."

933
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:22,860
Return back to your father. Go back to music.

934
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:27,924
"Your identity is not Mrs.
Nirmal Chaudhary, it's Anuradha Rai."

935
01:33:28,035 --> 01:33:30,868
You have no right to
kill that innocent Anuradha.

936
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:33,873
Are you bent on ruining me?

937
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:36,069
Do you want to break up my home?

938
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:43,907
"Forget about me, but your home?
It never got made then how can it break?"

939
01:33:44,418 --> 01:33:46,511
"Deepak! - Don't deceive yourself, Anu."

940
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:49,319
Your sky is just an illusion.

941
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:52,322
Come down on earth.

942
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:56,326
I know that a doctor will lose his wife...

943
01:33:57,031 --> 01:33:58,521
but the country will gain talent.

944
01:33:59,033 --> 01:34:01,263
How could you dare to say such things?

945
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:05,871
"Truth has given me the
courage, and my duty encouraged it."

946
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:11,408
"If your duty made you do this, even
my duty has told me a truth."

947
01:34:11,512 --> 01:34:15,642
"Hear that. This is my husband's
home. Staying here..."

948
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:19,316
you have no right to insult him! It
will be better if you leave.

949
01:34:33,968 --> 01:34:37,267
"How are you, Deepak? - I'm fine."

950
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:41,273
"Doctor, permit me to leave today."

951
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:45,308
How can I permit you to
leave? You are Anu's guest.

952
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:50,313
What if she has? - Anu? Lmpossible! I know her.

953
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:55,318
But why are you in such a hurry? Leave
after Ms. Seema's father arrives.

954
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:58,321
Did Anu give you your medicine? ...She didn't?

955
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,457
I'm noticing she is becoming very careless.

956
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:02,861
I'll send it.

957
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:10,368
You didn't give medicine to Deepak?

958
01:35:10,471 --> 01:35:13,065
"No! I am your wife, not your assistant."

959
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:15,875
God! You seem to be in a temper today.

960
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:20,909
You are always so busy. Do
you know what day it is today?

961
01:35:22,349 --> 01:35:24,840
It's a good day. It's Tuesday today.

962
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:28,253
What is the date today? - 7th November.

963
01:35:28,956 --> 01:35:36,863
What had happened on 7th November?
- Er... Louis Pasteur was born.

964
01:35:37,965 --> 01:35:39,262
Didn't someone get married on this day?

965
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,262
Many marriages must have taken place that day.

966
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:50,877
Oh... I know... even we got married on this day.

967
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:56,312
"You have forgotten the
day, atleast refresh the memories."

968
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:59,918
Even I should have
something that will help me live.

969
01:36:00,955 --> 01:36:04,356
Sure. I'll return at sharp 8 pm today.

970
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:07,359
"We'll go out, to the river
bank, wherever you say."

971
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:08,860
Be dressed and ready by 8.

972
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:14,264
Listen. Why do you forget
to give medicines to patients?

973
01:36:14,969 --> 01:36:16,869
Are you my wife or my assistant?

974
01:36:29,016 --> 01:36:32,315
I have kept your medicine. One
tablet at 8 and one at 10.

975
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:36,320
Listen.

976
01:36:40,027 --> 01:36:41,927
I am leaving tomorrow morning.

977
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:45,931
I want to tell you something before that.

978
01:36:48,035 --> 01:36:50,936
"You misunderstood me, Anu."

979
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:56,933
"It's true I loved Anuradha, love
her still, and always will."

980
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:02,279
But you are not my Anuradha. You
are only a doctor's wife.

981
01:37:05,419 --> 01:37:07,910
My Anuradha died long ago.

982
01:37:11,425 --> 01:37:13,916
Who we both loved dearly.

983
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:21,263
"I cannot bring her back to life, but
you can revive her if you like."

984
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:26,872
"I'm telling you once
again, don't ruin your life."

985
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:29,603
Don't let your talent go waste.

986
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,307
"You are mistaken, Deepak."

987
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:34,310
You said my husband doesn't love me.

988
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:39,918
"If that was true, why would he remind me
of our wedding anniversary today..."

989
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:44,317
which I had forgotten. Why
would he insist we go out?

990
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:48,927
There is not an iota of truth in what you said.

991
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:51,331
It's all lies! All of it!

992
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:54,933
It is easy to wake up a sleeping man.

993
01:37:56,437 --> 01:37:58,928
But one who is awake...

994
01:39:17,017 --> 01:39:19,417
The doctor has sent me. The
patient is very serious...

995
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,249
so he won't be able to come
now. He'll come in the morning.

996
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:22,854
Good night.

997
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:40,872
Listen.

998
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:50,313
Will you still deceive yourself?

999
01:39:52,019 --> 01:39:54,317
Will you still live in your dream
world which is just an illusion?

1000
01:39:55,422 --> 01:39:59,916
I tell you once again. You
have no right to ruin your life.

1001
01:40:01,028 --> 01:40:02,928
No right to destroy your talent.

1002
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:55,345
I was up all night.

1003
01:41:03,023 --> 01:41:06,322
What happened? Why are you sitting like that?

1004
01:41:07,027 --> 01:41:10,929
You couldn't fulfill my desire even for a day?

1005
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:16,935
"What desire? Oh, the marriage anniversary?"

1006
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:20,339
You think I was out enjoying?

1007
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:24,909
I am a doctor after all. My
first duty is towards my patients.

1008
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,912
Don't look at me like
that. Let me take some rest.

1009
01:41:35,022 --> 01:41:37,650
Doctor! - Who is it?

1010
01:41:38,025 --> 01:41:40,323
Madhav. The landlord has sent me.

1011
01:41:43,363 --> 01:41:47,322
He's called you. A doctor
has come from the city.

1012
01:41:49,436 --> 01:41:50,926
I'm coming.

1013
01:42:16,029 --> 01:42:20,329
You are leaving? - Yes Anu.

1014
01:42:21,368 --> 01:42:23,268
I want to return to my father.

1015
01:42:26,607 --> 01:42:29,474
Yes. You were right.

1016
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:35,310
I ruined my life. I don't
want to ruin it anymore.

1017
01:42:36,016 --> 01:42:43,320
"Oh. I am not pleased with
your decision, but I am happy."

1018
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:47,325
I should not be living here now.

1019
01:42:49,029 --> 01:42:51,930
I am going to the rest house. You
get ready and come there.

1020
01:43:17,624 --> 01:43:20,525
Who performed this operation? ...Who
performed this operation?

1021
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:24,259
"Our village doctor, Dr. Nirmal Chaudhary."

1022
01:43:24,965 --> 01:43:26,262
"Nirmal, come."

1023
01:43:34,007 --> 01:43:38,307
So you are Dr. Nirmal Chaudhary? - Yes.

1024
01:43:39,012 --> 01:43:44,973
The landlord told us that Seema
broke three ribs and ripped her cheek.

1025
01:43:45,085 --> 01:43:48,316
Yes. - But there is no scar on her face.

1026
01:43:49,022 --> 01:43:52,321
"She was afraid she'll have a
scar, so I did skin grafting."

1027
01:43:53,026 --> 01:43:56,325
"Skin graft? You mean, plastic surgery?"

1028
01:43:57,030 --> 01:44:00,124
Yes. - How could you dare!

1029
01:44:00,968 --> 01:44:01,935
Sorry?

1030
01:44:02,035 --> 01:44:06,267
Do you know what you did? You put me in trouble.

1031
01:44:06,974 --> 01:44:08,271
I don't understand.

1032
01:44:09,009 --> 01:44:12,410
"I mean, that I was very proud..."

1033
01:44:12,512 --> 01:44:16,107
that only I can perform such
operations in this country.

1034
01:44:17,017 --> 01:44:21,852
"But after this operation, you
have crushed my pride."

1035
01:44:22,356 --> 01:44:24,256
What are you saying. - The truth.

1036
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:27,188
I am surprised that
despite living in a village...

1037
01:44:27,294 --> 01:44:29,262
"how you managed to do
this, where did you learn it?"

1038
01:44:29,963 --> 01:44:34,263
I subscribe some foreign journals and read them.

1039
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:37,061
I have a small laboratory... - You have a lab?

1040
01:44:37,371 --> 01:44:40,306
"I'd like to see it right now.
- Take some rest now, Nolonel."

1041
01:44:40,407 --> 01:44:42,967
You have come from so far. Go
and see it in the evening.

1042
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:45,306
Evening? Alright.

1043
01:44:46,413 --> 01:44:49,280
"Dr. Chaudhary, are you married? - Yes."

1044
01:44:50,017 --> 01:44:51,917
Do you have a wife? - Sorry?

1045
01:44:52,419 --> 01:44:54,319
"I mean, does she live here? - Yes."

1046
01:44:55,022 --> 01:44:57,013
Then I'll have to come to your house for dinner.

1047
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:58,921
That's an honour.

1048
01:44:59,226 --> 01:45:03,253
"Honour or not, we'll
know that when I have dinner."

1049
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:13,872
"I forgot to introduce
you. He's my friend, Mr. Verma."

1050
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:18,307
He's a very rich man.

1051
01:45:19,012 --> 01:45:20,877
His wealth is infinite.

1052
01:45:21,948 --> 01:45:25,850
"He has a daughter, Seema, who
you have given new life."

1053
01:45:26,953 --> 01:45:28,250
She's his wealth.

1054
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:31,256
You also come to dinner.

1055
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:33,858
And also bring along his fees.

1056
01:45:34,361 --> 01:45:38,263
Why are you embarrassing me?
- That's why doctors like you go hungry.

1057
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:44,870
You get such a rich client once in a lifetime.

1058
01:45:45,972 --> 01:45:50,875
"Will there be chicken for
dinner? - Yes, but you can't eat."

1059
01:45:51,411 --> 01:45:54,869
"If I cannot eat, why should I
come? I'll stay here."

1060
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:00,919
I insulted you so much. Please forgive me.

1061
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:01,988
It's okay.

1062
01:46:02,089 --> 01:46:04,922
"Seema, forget all that. Let
the doctor go home."

1063
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:09,860
He has to shop for our dinner.

1064
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:12,263
Good day.

1065
01:46:14,968 --> 01:46:18,267
"Hearing you praise the doctor, I was fooled."

1066
01:46:18,972 --> 01:46:21,270
Fooled? You are a fool.

1067
01:46:23,009 --> 01:46:29,312
"It's me who is fooled. Just think, in a
village so far away from the city..."

1068
01:46:29,616 --> 01:46:31,311
we have such a good doctor!

1069
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:40,318
What happened? - I'm in very bad state.

1070
01:46:41,027 --> 01:46:42,324
Since the last one and a half months...

1071
01:46:44,431 --> 01:46:47,332
Oh! I understand. Does she feel nauseous?

1072
01:46:47,434 --> 01:46:48,924
"Yes, a little."

1073
01:46:49,436 --> 01:46:52,337
Does she like eating tangy things? - Yes.

1074
01:46:54,074 --> 01:46:56,474
Then you should be happy. - Why?

1075
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:58,134
Because you are going to be a father.

1076
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:02,310
Father? I'm talking about myself.

1077
01:47:03,016 --> 01:47:06,645
"I have gas problem. - 
Alright, come to the dispensary."

1078
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,317
I'll give you medicine.

1079
01:47:21,034 --> 01:47:25,869
Leave all that. Serve me
lunch. Then I'll go off to sleep.

1080
01:47:26,373 --> 01:47:27,863
And sleep until 6 pm in the evening.

1081
01:47:32,012 --> 01:47:33,411
I want to tell you something.

1082
01:47:33,513 --> 01:47:35,310
Listen to me first.

1083
01:47:35,415 --> 01:47:37,906
Do you know what certificate Nolonel
Trivedi has given me?

1084
01:47:38,418 --> 01:47:41,319
Will you always talk about
yourself? Won't you listen to me?

1085
01:47:42,022 --> 01:47:45,924
What is the matter? - I am
going to my father's place.

1086
01:47:46,426 --> 01:47:49,918
"You are missing Ranu? Sure,
go to your father's house."

1087
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:54,332
"You must go for a few days. - 
Not for a few days, forever."

1088
01:47:55,435 --> 01:47:56,333
Forever?

1089
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:00,870
I had left everything and came here.

1090
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:07,278
"My father, my home, and more than
anything else, my music."

1091
01:48:08,014 --> 01:48:10,881
"Everything, only so that I could get you."

1092
01:48:12,018 --> 01:48:15,317
But I could not even get you.

1093
01:48:17,023 --> 01:48:18,923
What are you saying?

1094
01:48:19,426 --> 01:48:22,259
I have never considered your
life separate from mine.

1095
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:25,591
I always considered us
one. - Lies! It's all lies.

1096
01:48:25,966 --> 01:48:30,266
"If you considered us one, you would
have understood my loneliness."

1097
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:32,265
You would understand my pain.

1098
01:48:33,373 --> 01:48:36,865
But I have not done anything deliberately.

1099
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:41,879
"If I could not care for you, I
didn't care for myself either."

1100
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:45,314
"What do I do Anu, my profession is such."

1101
01:48:46,019 --> 01:48:48,988
You have always seen
life with your point of view.

1102
01:48:49,089 --> 01:48:53,924
"You forgot that even I have
some desires, even I have a life."

1103
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:57,326
If your patients have only one life to live...

1104
01:48:57,631 --> 01:49:00,259
"even I have got only one life, not 3-4 lives."

1105
01:49:01,368 --> 01:49:04,860
And I cannot ruin this
life which I'll never get again.

1106
01:49:08,408 --> 01:49:12,868
"I am going to father, so
I can begin life anew."

1107
01:49:13,413 --> 01:49:15,904
Accept my music again.

1108
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:20,910
I am sure you won't feel alone without me.

1109
01:49:21,955 --> 01:49:26,255
You will get many people to
lay your bed and cook your food.

1110
01:49:29,162 --> 01:49:33,258
Deepak is coming in the
afternoon. I will leave with him.

1111
01:49:33,967 --> 01:49:35,867
Please don't try to stop me.

1112
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:41,864
"No Anu, I know I have no
right to stop you now."

1113
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:45,875
But I have a request.

1114
01:49:48,014 --> 01:49:51,313
Where you tolerated so much for 10 years...

1115
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:55,320
tolerate one more day.

1116
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:01,326
Don't go today. - Why?

1117
01:50:02,028 --> 01:50:04,326
Because Nolonel Trivedi and
his friends are coming here tonight.

1118
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:08,924
They invited themselves to dinner.

1119
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:17,335
"And they know you are here. - 
Alright, I'll inform Deepak."

1120
01:50:18,078 --> 01:50:19,943
But I will leave tomorrow morning.

1121
01:50:49,075 --> 01:50:49,939
Come in.

1122
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:56,378
"Please be seated, I'm coming."

1123
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:59,381
Listen. Where are you going?

1124
01:51:00,086 --> 01:51:02,418
To inform my wife. - Is everything okay?

1125
01:51:02,522 --> 01:51:04,649
Is it something to worry about?

1126
01:51:06,426 --> 01:51:08,917
"Go doctor, he's only joking."

1127
01:51:09,629 --> 01:51:13,326
"Nolonel, you are too much! - I am not wrong."

1128
01:51:14,034 --> 01:51:18,937
Some people are very perceptive.

1129
01:51:22,409 --> 01:51:25,867
The fragrance is good.

1130
01:51:27,013 --> 01:51:29,311
"Wonder if it's the food, or his wife."

1131
01:51:30,417 --> 01:51:31,281
Come.

1132
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:40,318
This is the same story. - Did you say something?

1133
01:52:42,422 --> 01:52:43,912
"No, nothing."

1134
01:52:49,028 --> 01:52:52,327
"My wife, Anuradha. - Wrong! Absolutely wrong!"

1135
01:52:57,237 --> 01:52:59,535
"She's first Anuradha, then your wife."

1136
01:53:00,974 --> 01:53:02,271
"Am I right, dear?"

1137
01:53:03,009 --> 01:53:08,311
You were Anuradha first.
And unfortunately became a doctor's wife.

1138
01:53:09,015 --> 01:53:10,312
Come dear.

1139
01:53:15,021 --> 01:53:15,919
Sit down.

1140
01:53:24,964 --> 01:53:27,364
"Nolonel, don't you want to see the laboratory?"

1141
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:31,870
"No, first her song, then
dinner, and then your laboratory."

1142
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:36,469
"Sing us a song, dear. - Yes please."

1143
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:39,877
I stopped singing long ago.

1144
01:53:41,014 --> 01:53:43,312
"I know, dear."

1145
01:53:45,018 --> 01:53:46,918
This dust and rust prove it.

1146
01:53:49,022 --> 01:53:52,321
"Don't feel shy dear, I am like your father."

1147
01:53:55,428 --> 01:53:57,328
Even I used to sing once upon a time.

1148
01:53:59,432 --> 01:54:01,263
What days those were.

1149
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:04,859
When I was in love with love.

1150
01:54:06,372 --> 01:54:10,866
"As much as you see me
laugh, I cry that much within."

1151
01:54:12,412 --> 01:54:14,880
Sing dear.

1152
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:42,306
Why don't those days return

1153
01:54:52,018 --> 01:54:54,919
The days...

1154
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,258
just pass by

1155
01:55:25,952 --> 01:55:33,859
"Where did those twinkling stars go?"

1156
01:55:44,971 --> 01:55:48,270
My heart burns like a lamp

1157
01:55:49,008 --> 01:55:50,873
And then blows off

1158
01:55:52,011 --> 01:55:57,916
Why don't those days return...

1159
01:56:29,415 --> 01:56:37,322
"My music lies abandoned without song"

1160
01:56:49,035 --> 01:56:54,940
My garland of dreams is withering

1161
01:56:57,076 --> 01:57:02,309
Why don't those days return...

1162
01:57:26,973 --> 01:57:28,600
Enough! - Don't give him any more.

1163
01:57:29,008 --> 01:57:31,875
He has colic pain. He'll
put me to trouble again.

1164
01:57:32,211 --> 01:57:33,678
Give me some.

1165
01:57:36,416 --> 01:57:40,910
Haven't you made enough? ...Then
give me all of it.

1166
01:57:44,023 --> 01:57:46,321
I don't mind even if I burst my stomach today.

1167
01:57:47,026 --> 01:57:51,929
Nall the cook. I want
to praise him for his cooking.

1168
01:57:56,035 --> 01:57:58,333
We don't have a cook.

1169
01:57:59,038 --> 01:58:07,309
That means all this has been
cooked by my daughter.

1170
01:58:11,017 --> 01:58:13,315
There are no servants in the house either.

1171
01:58:18,024 --> 01:58:18,922
The same story.

1172
01:58:21,027 --> 01:58:22,858
Exactly the same story.

1173
01:58:25,965 --> 01:58:27,262
Mind your head.

1174
01:58:30,369 --> 01:58:31,859
This is my small laboratory.

1175
01:58:33,372 --> 01:58:38,867
"What is this, doctor? - It is
a machine I have made myself."

1176
01:58:39,212 --> 01:58:40,076
Have a look.

1177
01:58:40,413 --> 01:58:43,280
Have you taken a patent of the machine?

1178
01:58:44,016 --> 01:58:46,576
"If you haven't, he will
manufacture them by the lot."

1179
01:58:57,029 --> 01:58:59,327
Why is there a cot in the laboratory?

1180
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:03,263
"When he gets tired working, he sleeps here."

1181
01:59:10,009 --> 01:59:15,003
"I can understand the cot, but
why this chair at this end?"

1182
01:59:15,114 --> 01:59:19,312
It means that when he
gets tired and falls asleep...

1183
01:59:20,019 --> 01:59:23,250
you sit here and serve your husband.

1184
01:59:26,359 --> 01:59:31,262
"Just like you, there was another woman..."

1185
01:59:31,964 --> 01:59:34,262
"who sacrificed her life, body, soul..."

1186
01:59:34,967 --> 01:59:36,867
"everything, for her husband."

1187
01:59:38,971 --> 01:59:42,270
Before that man could
realise... - What happened to her?

1188
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:46,877
She left... left forever.

1189
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:53,918
Who was she? - Will you ask even that?

1190
01:59:56,422 --> 01:59:59,414
"Honestly, Nolonel! You are absolutely right."

1191
01:59:59,525 --> 02:00:01,322
Dr. Chaudhary is a true genius.

1192
02:00:02,028 --> 02:00:02,926
I know.

1193
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:07,329
"Dr. Chaudhary, come here."

1194
02:00:12,438 --> 02:00:15,930
Perhaps you don't know...

1195
02:00:17,076 --> 02:00:20,944
what big credit performing
an operation on my daughter is for you.

1196
02:00:21,414 --> 02:00:23,279
The colonel has told me everything.

1197
02:00:25,418 --> 02:00:28,910
Accept this Rs.20000.

1198
02:00:30,022 --> 02:00:35,324
Don't consider it your
fees. Use it as you please.

1199
02:00:36,028 --> 02:00:39,327
Go abroad for further studies.

1200
02:00:40,032 --> 02:00:43,001
Or build a hospital and help the poor.

1201
02:00:43,102 --> 02:00:44,330
Do what you please with it.

1202
02:00:45,037 --> 02:00:50,942
I bow my head before the sacrifice and
dedication behind your work.

1203
02:00:51,477 --> 02:00:52,341
Wait!

1204
02:00:59,085 --> 02:01:03,317
"You are bowing before sacrifice and
dedication, aren't you?"

1205
02:01:04,023 --> 02:01:04,921
Yes.

1206
02:01:11,631 --> 02:01:14,930
"Then not him, give this cheque to her."

1207
02:01:19,438 --> 02:01:22,874
"Yes, she is the one who truly deserves it."

1208
02:01:25,011 --> 02:01:28,310
"Whatever Nirmal is today, is
because of her sacrifice."

1209
02:01:30,016 --> 02:01:32,917
Her voice is lost today.

1210
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:36,318
Her music is rusting.

1211
02:01:37,423 --> 02:01:42,918
"To give life to others, she gave up her music."

1212
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:50,333
"Anu, your husband will become a
very renowned man one day."

1213
02:01:51,437 --> 02:01:56,340
He will make headlines. People will welcome him.

1214
02:01:57,076 --> 02:02:00,307
"They will sing his praises, honour him."

1215
02:02:02,014 --> 02:02:03,879
But no one will realise...

1216
02:02:07,019 --> 02:02:10,113
"that far away, behind all this applause..."

1217
02:02:10,423 --> 02:02:11,913
was a voice that got lost.

1218
02:02:15,027 --> 02:02:16,927
There was a flower that withered away.

1219
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:20,328
A light that blew off.

1220
02:02:23,369 --> 02:02:30,275
"Hiralal, these are our
daughters, sisters, mothers of ours..."

1221
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:33,308
who no one knows.

1222
02:02:34,413 --> 02:02:38,281
"When you see them, don't see what they are."

1223
02:02:39,418 --> 02:02:41,909
See what they could be but didn't become.

1224
02:02:43,022 --> 02:02:46,924
Even praising them is their insult.

1225
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:51,929
"Nhild, I cannot even bless you."

1226
02:02:53,432 --> 02:02:55,923
Blessings are given to those younger than us.

1227
02:02:57,036 --> 02:03:05,307
But you are bigger than all of us.

1228
02:03:07,012 --> 02:03:12,314
I pray that if ever I
have done any good in life...

1229
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:16,317
may you benefit from it.

1230
02:03:18,023 --> 02:03:21,857
"May you be happy, always."

1231
02:03:23,963 --> 02:03:27,865
And people like us...

1232
02:03:29,368 --> 02:03:36,274
Bye doctor... bye dear. Bless you.

1233
02:04:11,010 --> 02:04:17,882
"Anuradha, tomorrow morning, you..."

1234
02:04:19,018 --> 02:04:21,851
"Yes, I have a lot to do tomorrow morning."

1235
02:05:07,967 --> 02:05:12,267
"Ratan, what happened? - Hurry
doctor! My wife is very sick."

1236
02:05:12,371 --> 02:05:15,863
"I don't know what's wrong with
her. - Don't worry, I'm coming."

1237
02:05:27,953 --> 02:05:29,853
Come doctor. - Let's go.

1238
02:06:16,969 --> 02:06:19,870
"Doctor, save her! Please save her!"

1239
02:06:22,007 --> 02:06:26,876
"You are God, you can do everything. I
cannot live without her, doctor."

1240
02:06:28,013 --> 02:06:32,313
I promise I'll do everything. I'll
serve her all day and night.

1241
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:49,330
Don't forget that God has
given life to millions of mites too.

1242
02:06:50,035 --> 02:06:51,525
But talent only to a few.

1243
02:06:52,037 --> 02:06:55,336
"By turning away from it, you
are not insulting yourself, but God."

1244
02:06:59,078 --> 02:07:00,875
I had left everything and came here.

1245
02:07:01,413 --> 02:07:02,971
"Everything, only so that I could get you."

1246
02:07:03,082 --> 02:07:05,312
But I could not even get you.

1247
02:07:06,418 --> 02:07:09,910
"Whatever Nirmal is today, is
because of her sacrifice."

1248
02:07:11,423 --> 02:07:14,324
Her voice is lost today.

1249
02:07:17,029 --> 02:07:20,931
I am sure you won't miss me.

1250
02:07:21,567 --> 02:07:24,866
"Your identity is not Mrs.
Nirmal Chaudhary, it's Anuradha Rai."

1251
02:07:25,371 --> 02:07:27,862
You have no right to
kill that innocent Anuradha.

1252
02:10:23,015 --> 02:10:23,879
The car...

1253
02:10:32,424 --> 02:10:35,325
Don't you have even that much right over me...

1254
02:10:36,028 --> 02:10:37,655
can't you even tell me...

1255
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:39,930
'Go away! Don't come here again'
