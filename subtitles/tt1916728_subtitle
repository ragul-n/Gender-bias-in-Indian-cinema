1
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,069
''Round and round,
turns a wheel.''

2
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:07,769
''The world rocks on its tune.''

3
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:11,477
''If slipped a little,
you'll get a big hit.''

4
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:14,948
''Whatever you do here,
you'll pay for it right here.''

5
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:17,046
''As deeds are to be paid here!''

6
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:24,829
''It'll try to stop you,
it'll try to halt you...''

7
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:27,795
''It'll halt you and kill you.''

8
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:32,271
''You'll certainly lose,
as deeds are to be paid here!''

9
00:01:32,339 --> 00:01:39,768
''No one has escaped from
it's clutches, nor will you.''

10
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:46,911
''Your conscience and your existence
will destroy falling under it's effect.''

11
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:37,335
Damn, is everything for free here?

12
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:39,532
What amazing girls, yaar!

13
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:41,005
Hey, hey!

14
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:43,032
Go take a look around the place.

15
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:44,607
See if you can find that author.

16
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:46,073
I'll go see.

17
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,974
What is it?

18
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:49,379
Give me the paper.

19
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,141
Let me see his face one more time.

20
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:53,142
He's the one, isn't he?

21
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,053
You remember his face, don't you?
- You bet!

22
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:59,654
Food, booze, money!!!

23
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:01,951
The scent of all three together!

24
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:04,230
This is life!

25
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,362
Hey, don't create a scene.

26
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,291
Let'sjust go stand in a corner.

27
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:10,866
C'mon.

28
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:21,636
Yaar, why are these people
written about in page 3?

29
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,644
Because the real news gets
printed in the first two pages!

30
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:30,146
Would you care for
some bubbly, sir? - What?

31
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:31,554
Babli? Who's Bunty then?!

32
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:33,416
Excuse me?

33
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,593
Let the applejuice
be, get me some whiskey.

34
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,391
You paying from your pocket?
Get me a large, and quick!

35
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:44,161
And listen, keep coming
back every five minutes.

36
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:45,496
Now get going, quick!

37
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,240
Stand straight.
Don't fidget around.

38
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,972
Tilak, Uncle's getting ready to
leave. He's started his bye-bye's.

39
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:55,378
Let's get out ofhere as well.

40
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,619
What is it? What you staring at?

41
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,433
And what are those gloves for?

42
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,932
You're gonna bat
after you're off duty?

43
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,229
The tyre is probably punctured.

44
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:45,591
Stop the car by the side.

45
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:49,298
Check if there's a puncture...

46
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:55,569
What's going on?!
Who are you... What?!

47
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,075
Shut up! Look ahead, c'mon!

48
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:59,541
Ok... ok... don't hurt
me. You guys can...

49
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:01,513
What are you doing?
Put that back on. C'mon.

50
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:03,981
He's offering it with all
his heart. We should take it.

51
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:07,153
You idiot, let'sjust
take what we want. Got it?

52
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:09,221
What do you guys want from me?

53
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,281
A copy of yournew book.
- But that's not published yet!

54
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:13,483
That'sjust why we've come.

55
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,585
We hear many publishers
are fighting for your book?

56
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:18,222
Let them fight. We're going
to publish your book first.

57
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:20,026
Just give us the copy.

58
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:27,232
Yeah, Saroja... It's me...

59
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:29,805
There's a copy of
the final manuscript...

60
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:32,468
Yeah, the one on the desk...

61
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:36,079
I'm sending a guy,
give him the copy...

62
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:40,477
I'm sending him right away... Yes...

63
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,720
What you staring at?

64
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:51,189
Are you gonna memorize my
face to describe to the cops?

65
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:01,597
This kidnapping business, is
this a regularjob for you guys?

66
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,036
No, it's our first time.

67
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:06,671
Doesn't seem like it.

68
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,381
- There he is.
- Here it is.

69
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:20,788
Show, show... Show it to
me! Very cool! Lets leave.

70
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,327
Not handing us
something else, are you?

71
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:23,760
It's gonna be published
under yourname.

72
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,127
Yourreputation will
be ruined for nothing.

73
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:26,665
Let's go.

74
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:38,168
''Don't do any childishness!
Your deeds are visible to all.''

75
00:06:38,244 --> 00:06:42,180
''It'll kill you slowly
and steadily.''

76
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:45,479
''Call upon any God,
your end is final.''

77
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:49,784
''It'll strive you for
every drop oflife...''

78
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:57,859
''It'll try to stop you,
it'll try to halt you...''

79
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,195
''It'll halt you and kill you.''

80
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:05,897
''You'll certainly lose,
as deeds are to be paid here!''

81
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,524
Sir, you don't have to do this.

82
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:46,468
Please. Let me do
it, leave it to me!

83
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:48,573
Don't worry.

84
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:50,411
Take it easy, sir.

85
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,642
Go on inside and enjoy
the air-conditioning.

86
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:00,792
I don't know, sir.
Never seen him before.

87
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:25,517
From the outside, this
building looks so shitty.

88
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:27,515
Inside... it looks all cool!

89
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,383
Looks like you're setting
up a huge business.

90
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:33,855
Yes, but you've come from
foreign? Where have you come from?

91
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:34,985
New to the city?

92
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:37,922
Hello, that's enough
- you can leave now.

93
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:41,626
Yeah? Why don't you go on...

94
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:07,318
Oh, come on, sir... You're a big
man setting up this big business...

95
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:08,985
I didn't go to work
because of you, sir.

96
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:13,230
And now it's too late. I would've
made six times this much, sir.

97
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,678
Alrght, I guess. Anyway, very
good luck with your business!

98
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:35,281
And, sir... I have a friend who is
really good at setting up businesses.

99
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:37,349
I've already told him about you.

100
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:42,552
He'll handle your business.

101
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:45,888
He'll provide you
security... He's really good.

102
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:50,302
Think about it, sir...

103
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:03,875
Shit! Just at the right time
he plays like a superstar!

104
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:08,281
He'll get on the team for
sure! We're screwed, man!

105
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,924
Look at the selectors.
Just look at them!

106
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:14,617
They're watching every ball.

107
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:18,296
Do your best. We
both need to crack it!

108
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:20,864
Three matches, right? We
can't mess up even one.

109
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,729
If we screw up today,

110
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:24,995
we'll be under pressure
for the other two matches.

111
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,663
Why are you pressuring me?

112
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:28,430
Let me go play in peace, na?

113
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:17,452
Shit, shit! I should
have played better!

114
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,058
I lost my chance.

115
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,490
I should havejust
whacked every ball!

116
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,050
Who cares for technique these days!

117
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:23,527
No chance of me getting selected.

118
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:25,358
No man. It'll all be
fine. Don't worry too much.

119
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:27,228
My chances of making it are zero!

120
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,200
And you know it too!
So stop bullshitting me!

121
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:33,728
We DO have a problem.

122
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:35,565
What have I been
saying all this time?

123
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,697
No man, listen...

124
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,738
We need to do something.

125
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:40,538
Can'tjust sit around.

126
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:42,573
We need some sort of... guarantee.

127
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:44,707
What crap! Who will
give me guarantee?

128
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:46,608
Ask your coach or something...

129
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:48,251
Shit, man.

130
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:53,715
Don't you have any photos
with modern outfits?

131
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:56,455
Yeah there are.
Let me check.

132
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,259
As per your wish.

133
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:04,065
Go ahead and ask what you want.

134
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:20,643
Why can't you get Robin's bike?

135
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:24,151
I can't take my Scooty.
Mom's hidden the keys somewhere.

136
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,720
Savvy, please do something.
Please get me out ofhere.

137
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:31,424
Every day, they truss me up in
front of somejoker like a showpiece.

138
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,656
They're going ahead fixing my
wedding without even asking me!

139
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,098
Please, Savvy, come soon.

140
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:48,508
Savvy, my lips are dry,
it's paining, man, please!

141
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:02,594
So... when will they announce
the final cricket team?

142
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:03,856
Told you, next week.

143
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:06,625
Next week for sure?

144
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:08,257
How many times will you ask me?

145
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:11,060
There's so much tension at home.

146
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:12,795
I am going crazy...

147
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:16,141
I will be relieved
once you get selected.

148
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:23,445
I was wondering...

149
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,211
you should talk to someone...

150
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:27,419
Talk to whom?

151
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:29,744
Someone you know...

152
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:32,620
Please, Sejal, don't start again.
I am way too stressed already!

153
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,861
Okay, I won't. Okay?

154
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,287
Show, show...

155
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:04,523
Wow, cool!

156
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,152
Enough, guys, I gotta go.

157
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:10,261
Come on! Lets have one
more shot! Wejust started.

158
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,889
Sapna is alone at home.
Why don't you understand?

159
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,691
True! Now that you have a wife,
why would you care for old friends?

160
00:14:16,903 --> 00:14:19,770
One more yaar, last one.

161
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,768
That's it. Fine, last one.

162
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:57,258
Oye! You should see her with
her uniform off!. What an item!

163
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:59,267
There he goes again, Tilak!

164
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:01,202
I have seen her naked.
Top to bottom!

165
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,669
Only person you've seen
top to bottom is you!

166
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,674
Dude, I am notjoking.
I've really seen her naked.

167
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:09,138
She hasn't even looked at you once!

168
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:11,682
She'sjust showing offin front
of those English-speaking morons!

169
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:13,048
Like she doesn't know me!

170
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:16,017
Ok then, what's her name. Go on!

171
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:18,022
Err... l've forgotten it, man.

172
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:22,123
What's in a name anyway? I swear
I took her into that room next door!

173
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:24,761
What?! You need proof?.

174
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:26,428
What proofwill you get?

175
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:28,057
A signed affidavit from her?

176
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:29,328
Shall I bring her here right now?

177
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:32,803
Just say the word!
I'll go bring her right now.

178
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,676
Fine, go get her.
- Go, go, go!

179
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,287
These are wedding gifts.

180
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:41,630
They've been lying
around for a while.

181
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,225
I had nothing to do,
so I just opened them.

182
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:46,798
Anything of use or same
old boring presents?

183
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:53,373
Umm... there are 4 clocks, 6 Ganesh
idols and there's this mixer.

184
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:55,443
Good, atleast there's
one useful thing.

185
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:56,811
There's no mixer in the house.

186
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,212
Yeah, but there's masala in it.

187
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:03,178
They must've flicked it
off some place. - Huh?

188
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:04,051
Nothing.

189
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,152
Pass me those envelops.

190
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:11,693
There's no money in
there. They're empty.

191
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:14,565
What?! You took it all?

192
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:19,534
No, no! They were always empty.
Before I even opened them.

193
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:21,339
Who brought all of this home?

194
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:27,073
Your friends,
Mandookji... and Rameshji.

195
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:31,149
I gotta go to work.
I'll be back in the evening.

196
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,547
You're in the book business, right?

197
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,815
Yes, we print books.

198
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:39,188
Publishing business.

199
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:40,657
Can I come see the office?

200
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,229
Not today.
I have a client meeting.

201
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:04,847
They're making a Hollywood
film based on this!

202
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:06,573
How about this one?

203
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,349
How's this selling?

204
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:12,586
What? Well... that's in demand too.

205
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:16,949
Would you like to
buy something, sir?

206
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:18,093
Pack this one.

207
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:20,484
Wait a minute.

208
00:20:28,404 --> 00:20:30,065
You sure you want to
buy ALL these, sir?

209
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:35,375
Pack these.

210
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:38,509
Yeah, of course!
Go on and pack them.

211
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:55,460
Are these books heading to Bandra?
- Yes, sir.

212
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:57,055
Chhotu, bring the new books inside.

213
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:10,541
Bhupi, find out when we're
getting that Chintan Gandhi book?

214
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:37,963
Hey, come here.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:40,800
Why are some pages missing here?

216
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:47,744
Oh, wejust missed printing
a few pages. Don't worry...

217
00:21:47,984 --> 00:21:50,578
No one will know. Who reads
a book completely anyway?!

218
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,587
What? We're in the
business of selling books.

219
00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:56,719
Just because we sell at half price
doesn't mean we sell halfbooks.

220
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:58,987
Sir, the customer
will not remember

221
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:00,824
what kid sold him
at which traffic light!

222
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,520
Will you do your work or not?

223
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:05,131
Sir, tell you what...
let's staple the pages on.

224
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:07,693
What?
- Let's staple the missing pages!

225
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:10,065
How many have you printed so far?

226
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:11,663
Wejust started
the second lot, sir.

227
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,672
Dump it. Start a new lot.

228
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:17,012
Err... It'll be a waste
of time and money!

229
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:20,740
Do it. Now!
- Okay, sir.

230
00:22:24,854 --> 00:22:25,821
What's yourname again?

231
00:22:27,256 --> 00:22:28,188
Sawan What?

232
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:30,717
Are you from the south?

233
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:33,284
Not really, sir. I've been
in Bombay for a long time.

234
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:35,524
But my family is from the south.

235
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:38,694
Hello! Yeah, when are we
announcing the Mumbai team?

236
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:43,095
Under 22? Nothing much...
there's this kid here...

237
00:22:43,873 --> 00:22:45,500
Ok Listen, Ill call you back later.

238
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:53,741
You're not the only one
desperate for a place in the team.

239
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:56,285
There are tons of players
willing to pay money.

240
00:22:57,019 --> 00:22:59,214
Player's salaries have
gone up these days.

241
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:03,992
If you get into the 20-20 league,
sky is the limit! You agree?

242
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:07,320
To run any business,
you must invest first.

243
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:09,858
And you're your own business!

244
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:14,124
Where else can you recover
yourinvestment so quickly.

245
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:17,205
Listen, if you were
a mind-blowing player,

246
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,597
I wouldn't be talking money at all.

247
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:23,611
Don't get me wrong,
you play very well...

248
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,242
...but you're no Sachin Tendulkar!

249
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:32,743
If you were, even God can't
stop you from being on the team!

250
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:38,821
Arrange the money by next
week. 1 million rupees. Okay?

251
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:53,831
Come on, come on!

252
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,703
Savvy? Want a ride to
your practice session?

253
00:23:57,146 --> 00:23:58,977
No, you carry on.
I'll go in the evening.

254
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:02,007
Savvy, keep him in the shade, okay?

255
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:04,314
Listen to your Uncle,
there's a good boy!

256
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:09,057
Akka... - Yes?

257
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:12,652
Akka, do we have some money saved?

258
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:15,655
You need money? How much?

259
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,695
Some... 1 million...

260
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:27,806
Never mind, it's okay.

261
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:30,302
Why do you need so
much money, Savvy?

262
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,374
Forget it, it's nothing.

263
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:35,716
If you need a ride from
the ground, call me.

264
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,691
You remember the girl at the party?

265
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:48,762
Spare me, dude.
- No, really, I'm telling you, man!

266
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:50,355
Okay, hang on, let me show you...

267
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:55,834
Now talk!

268
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,070
Dude, this is that
same girl! What an item!

269
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:04,306
She let you film her?
- As if she knew that!

270
00:25:05,948 --> 00:25:08,041
Send it to my phone! Sure, sure!

271
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:11,619
Bluetooth it.
- Yeah, yeah, take it!

272
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:16,283
Boy, this is fun!

273
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:21,057
Mandook! To the
left... the green bag...

274
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,660
- Yeah, saw it...
- Next station... we make ourmove.

275
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:00,364
Motherfu! Where
did you find this??

276
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:04,099
Where the hell did you find it?

277
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:07,006
I never thought I'd hold an AK-47!

278
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:08,938
How do you know it's an AK-47?

279
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:10,940
They show it all the time on TV...

280
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:13,914
Is it written anywhere? Huh?
- Must be written somewhere...

281
00:26:14,183 --> 00:26:16,083
It's an AK-56, you moron.

282
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:18,277
I'm telling you,
this is an AK-47!

283
00:26:18,354 --> 00:26:22,017
What does it matter whether it's 47
or 56? Where did you get it from?

284
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:23,283
How does that matter?

285
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,761
We hit thejackpot.
We can make a lot of money!

286
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,321
Have you lost it? There may
be cops looking for this.

287
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:31,194
What ifit belongs to terrorists?

288
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:33,827
Nah... can't be.
Don't try to scare us.

289
00:26:33,903 --> 00:26:36,463
We can loot a big
place with this baby!

290
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:39,433
Shopping mall,jewelry shop... Bank!

291
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:43,141
We couldjust sell
them and make money.

292
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:45,510
No way! I'm not letting
anyone sell this!

293
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:48,981
But we can sell the
rest of the loot, right?

294
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:52,913
Fine. Let's talk to
Tipu-bhai. - Yeah, talk to him.

295
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:54,913
And look at this
- the highlight!

296
00:26:55,424 --> 00:26:56,448
Have you ever seen a bomb blast?

297
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:58,322
Be careful, it may
be on, you moron!

298
00:26:58,394 --> 00:27:00,294
Nah, its fuse is blown.

299
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,021
Give it to me. Put it
back. You guys have lost it.

300
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,991
With this baby in your hand,
you can do anything. Anything!

301
00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:09,033
Put it down, asshole!

302
00:27:09,972 --> 00:27:11,166
Turn it away, you idiot!

303
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,207
There're no bullets,
yaar. See? See!

304
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:15,240
You're crazy!

305
00:27:15,311 --> 00:27:17,404
See? No bullets! See, see!

306
00:27:26,522 --> 00:27:29,514
Tilak! Ramesh! Look here!

307
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,892
See? No bullets!

308
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:55,910
I didn't understand. Are
you selling something?

309
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:04,091
You are building a swanky office.

310
00:28:06,795 --> 00:28:07,955
You've spent a lot.

311
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:10,931
If someone breaks in, you would
end up spending double, right?

312
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:12,927
I'm asking for much less.

313
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:17,697
Are you asking me to leave?

314
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:22,076
If you have to go, carry on please.

315
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:24,979
If you want me to
go, say so clearly.

316
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,283
So let me get to the point.

317
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,951
What kind oflife would you like?

318
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:41,996
Go to work, do your work, get back
- without any tension, right?

319
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:50,704
To be tension-free, you need
security. Which we can guarantee.

320
00:28:51,206 --> 00:28:53,299
You can even trust us
with your office keys.

321
00:28:58,213 --> 00:29:00,977
Do I look like a guard to you?

322
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:12,922
Me and my friends
are your security.

323
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:27,970
I'm here to help you.

324
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:31,206
And you're going on about
who and why and crap...

325
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,612
It's your choice.
Think about it.

326
00:29:45,961 --> 00:29:48,156
Is this the way you talk to guests?

327
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:55,937
Okay, never mind. You're busy.

328
00:29:56,872 --> 00:30:01,070
Sorry I wasted your time.

329
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,378
1... 2... 3... 4... 5

330
00:30:05,114 --> 00:30:09,414
What the hell! I'd asked for
three truckloads of people...

331
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:12,285
...and they've sent me 6 bikes!
How in hell will this work?

332
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:14,185
Call the supplier. Quick!

333
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:18,359
Turn the bloody volume down!

334
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:25,394
The noise in this city
fucks up your head.

335
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:28,993
If a man can't even hear himself
how will he think properly?

336
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:31,862
And ifhe ends up doing some
shit, you can't blame him, can you?

337
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:35,304
That Party Secretary's son...
he partied all night long...

338
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:39,678
Somewhere he got into an argument.
Next thing you know, he got shot.

339
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:42,180
Now we have to do a Protest
Rally and rioting and stuff!.

340
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:44,014
Did you call him?

341
00:30:45,354 --> 00:30:46,252
So, all well?

342
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:47,813
Going on, Bhaiyya...

343
00:30:48,157 --> 00:30:49,454
This one doesn't talk at all.

344
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:51,457
You haven't forgotten me, right?

345
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:52,819
Tipu Uncle!

346
00:30:53,362 --> 00:30:55,227
Yes,just like Sawan Uncle!

347
00:30:55,297 --> 00:30:57,094
Yourmom is like a sister to me.

348
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:00,793
How's the cricket going?
- Pretty well...

349
00:31:00,969 --> 00:31:04,302
Play for India
quickly. With Sachin.

350
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,899
Don't forget me after
you become a star, ok?

351
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,975
Oh come on, Bhaiyya!

352
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:11,403
Tipu-Bhaiyya, I wanted
to ask you something...

353
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,804
Yes, go on, go on!

354
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:16,042
Cricket selections are on. And
I don't know anyone else but you.

355
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:19,119
Can your Party Secretary
put in a word for me?

356
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:22,882
You should've told me two days
ago. I'd have done something.

357
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:25,952
Now's a bad time.

358
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:28,153
We're in the middle of
organizing some rioting...

359
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:30,324
Actually Bhaiyya...

360
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:32,764
Okay, move it, move
it. Quick, quick!

361
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:41,433
Mandook. Want to come along?

362
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,343
Me? Really?
- Yes, you.

363
00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:47,339
Let's go!

364
00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:48,443
Are you mad?

365
00:31:50,252 --> 00:31:52,345
Next time, Tipu-Bhai! Sure!

366
00:31:54,223 --> 00:31:55,918
When are you coming
to see the loot?

367
00:31:57,493 --> 00:31:58,517
I'll call you!

368
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:01,795
Sawan... if you need
anything,just text me.

369
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:09,822
''This heart is aware of everything.''

370
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:14,299
''Still it makes excuses.''

371
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:20,338
''These killing eyes
have stuck on him.''

372
00:33:20,742 --> 00:33:24,610
''He still did not
understand my intentions.''

373
00:33:25,781 --> 00:33:30,377
''This heart
gives many excuses.''

374
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:35,085
''These killing eyes did not
understand my intentions.''

375
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:36,454
''Slowly.''

376
00:33:36,758 --> 00:33:39,124
''Slowly my eyes...''

377
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,589
''...and my heart...''

378
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:44,089
''...started liking him.''

379
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,833
''Slowly...''

380
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:49,296
''Slowly to my eyes...''

381
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:53,132
''...and to me he appears
very close to heart.''

382
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:26,867
''Ambiance is full of romance...''

383
00:34:27,342 --> 00:34:31,472
''...for two hearts to meet.''

384
00:34:32,214 --> 00:34:37,345
''Eyes appeal...''

385
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,717
''...for these moments to halt.''

386
00:34:42,691 --> 00:34:47,287
''How do my lips whisper...''

387
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:51,755
''Though locked it reveals
everything of my heart.''

388
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,460
''Slowly.''

389
00:34:53,602 --> 00:34:55,763
''Slowly my eyes...''

390
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,534
''...and my heart...''

391
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,504
''...started liking him.''

392
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:03,575
''Slowly...''

393
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:06,212
''Slowly a stranger...''

394
00:35:06,448 --> 00:35:12,250
''...appears very close to my heart.''

395
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,555
''My love...''

396
00:35:22,764 --> 00:35:24,857
''Slowly...''

397
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,102
No, no! I don't want it.

398
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:15,808
What kind of man are you, sir?

399
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:19,376
Buy the pretty Madam a pretty
necklace. Don't be stingy!

400
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,982
I ran into Madam and I
thought I'll say hello to her!

401
00:36:25,761 --> 00:36:27,092
Helloo!

402
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:29,387
No need to shout.

403
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:33,401
I wasjust trying to help.

404
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:39,067
Madam, whether you know
us or not, we know you...

405
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:41,504
The other day we saw you get
home at 3 AM in a Mercedes!

406
00:36:44,112 --> 00:36:48,048
Calm down. He said he was
passing by, and said hello.

407
00:36:52,454 --> 00:36:54,217
Don't shout. We're going...

408
00:36:59,828 --> 00:37:01,125
Keep your hands to yourself.

409
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:18,137
Hey Mandook, why isn't
your Tipu here yet?

410
00:37:18,608 --> 00:37:20,132
Will he come for sure?
- Yeah, man,

411
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,007
soon as he comes we'll take him to
the press and show him the stuff.

412
00:37:22,078 --> 00:37:23,568
Let's have a drink till then.

413
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:26,312
Hey Mandook, look!

414
00:37:27,183 --> 00:37:28,844
You're item's boyfriend's here.

415
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,885
What a fool he made out
of you with his English.

416
00:37:32,522 --> 00:37:35,082
He even gave you a
lovely name. 'Ass'!

417
00:37:36,726 --> 00:37:40,253
Stop it, man! Hey you!
Pourme another drink!

418
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:53,575
He's stored the stuff
in the loft at the press.

419
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:56,712
Hey Mandook, the
stuff's safe right?

420
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,804
Yeah, yeah.

421
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:06,415
I'll go take a leak.

422
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:47,691
Dont even think about getting up!

423
00:38:47,764 --> 00:38:51,325
You went on and on in English
the other day huh? Now talk!

424
00:38:53,236 --> 00:38:56,535
Yeah! You're 'just only! ' You
fucker! I'll adjust you right now!

425
00:38:57,674 --> 00:39:00,575
Eyyy! Don't even
think of cleaning up!

426
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:02,540
C'mon... say sorry in English.

427
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:05,972
Say it in English, you fucker!!

428
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:07,613
That's what I said. Sorry!

429
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:11,048
Say it from the
heart! Say 'Sorry sir.'

430
00:39:13,857 --> 00:39:15,586
Say 'Sorry sir you
are a superstar.'

431
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:17,790
Arrange for two more.

432
00:39:18,261 --> 00:39:18,989
Just do it.

433
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:21,329
Tipu's here.

434
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:23,731
It's business time,
I'll talk to you later.

435
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,030
- Tipu-bhai, how goes?
- How's everything?

436
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:27,462
This is my man, Tilak.

437
00:39:33,643 --> 00:39:34,803
Where's Mandook?

438
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:36,770
Where's Mandook?

439
00:39:39,616 --> 00:39:40,674
Give me your purse.

440
00:39:45,321 --> 00:39:46,447
Give me your phone.

441
00:39:46,523 --> 00:39:49,549
It's brand new. I spent
my entire salary on it.

442
00:39:49,726 --> 00:39:51,887
Which idiot buys a phone
with his entire salary?

443
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:53,086
Bloody it'sjust to make calls!

444
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:54,762
Out with it, give me the phone.

445
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:57,491
It's brand new! Haven't
even taken the plastic off.

446
00:39:57,567 --> 00:39:59,467
Yeah? Let me see... c'mon.

447
00:40:01,438 --> 00:40:03,372
Hmm... it's nice!!

448
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:07,943
Hey Mandook, what are
you doing up there?

449
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:09,603
Get down! Have you lost it?

450
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,873
No big deal, man.

451
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:12,805
Wasjust scaring him, for fun.

452
00:40:12,882 --> 00:40:15,544
You dumb ass, what're you doing
with the gun out in public?

453
00:40:16,286 --> 00:40:18,550
You moron, stop fucking around now.

454
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:25,284
What does piece of shit mean?

455
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:31,566
He's MY friend. I can
abuse him. You can't.

456
00:40:31,835 --> 00:40:33,462
C'mon, let's get out ofhere now.

457
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:37,066
- C'mon, let's scoot from this place.
- What's up?

458
00:40:37,307 --> 00:40:39,002
Let'sjust get out ofhere.

459
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:41,900
Hello, do you have
the stuff or not??

460
00:40:45,448 --> 00:40:47,075
What the fuck!

461
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:48,543
Isn't it fabulous?

462
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:50,780
That's some loot!

463
00:40:51,754 --> 00:40:52,948
Let me call the hero.

464
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:55,286
I'd gone on the sets... That
heroine was there, too...

465
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:56,382
what's her name?

466
00:40:56,526 --> 00:40:57,891
The one with the long neck...

467
00:40:59,629 --> 00:41:01,460
what's her name...
the one with big...

468
00:41:01,664 --> 00:41:03,063
Yes, Hero-Bhai... How are you?

469
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:05,564
No,just got my
hands on some goods...

470
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,698
No, not a girl... the
other kind of goods...

471
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:13,599
Yes. There are a
couple of revolvers...

472
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:16,508
No, not German. Looks local.

473
00:41:16,846 --> 00:41:18,575
There's a bomb here...

474
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:22,474
I don't know ifit's RD X or
not. Never seen RD X before...

475
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,815
Looks like it will blast.

476
00:41:26,122 --> 00:41:27,419
It will blast, right?

477
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,321
Sure it will. Very loudly, too!

478
00:41:29,726 --> 00:41:31,591
You are right, what
use is it to you...

479
00:41:32,328 --> 00:41:33,989
Mandook, selling the
bomb looks difficult.

480
00:41:34,797 --> 00:41:36,992
There's more top
quality stuff... 47, 56...

481
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:39,857
Hold on please...

482
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:43,402
Yes, Mom, what is it?

483
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:46,598
Oh, for heaven's sake,
make whatever you want!

484
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,004
No, not that vegetable.
It causes gas! Gotta go!

485
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:55,107
Sorry, Bhai, one
second... Is it 47 or 56?

486
00:41:57,587 --> 00:42:01,353
They don't know... What
difference does a number make!

487
00:42:01,424 --> 00:42:03,619
It's an AK, isn't that enough?

488
00:42:04,561 --> 00:42:06,358
Everything is for sale,
right? - Yes. - No.

489
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,124
Yes or no?

490
00:42:08,464 --> 00:42:10,762
How can you have the heart
to sell this? Please yaar...

491
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:14,029
Oh, you want a photo?

492
00:42:15,638 --> 00:42:18,004
Sure... Happy shooting!

493
00:43:30,947 --> 00:43:32,812
I had called earlier...

494
00:43:33,016 --> 00:43:38,613
some people... they
are threatening me...

495
00:43:48,331 --> 00:43:49,059
Girlfriend?

496
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:52,034
Did they enter? Did
they do anything to her?

497
00:43:52,335 --> 00:43:57,773
No. They didn't do
anything. It's all veiled.

498
00:44:03,846 --> 00:44:05,370
Do you know who they are?

499
00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:09,576
Actually, I don't
know who they are...

500
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:13,522
See, it's festival time...
these things happen.

501
00:44:14,057 --> 00:44:16,082
It's so sad how they
harass decent men.

502
00:44:16,959 --> 00:44:20,588
Don't pay them heed and they
won't harass you anymore.

503
00:44:21,964 --> 00:44:24,797
They're all bloody street
dogs. They are better off dead!

504
00:44:27,837 --> 00:44:30,067
Okay... if something happens,
come and see me tomorrow. Okay?

505
00:44:31,374 --> 00:44:34,605
By the way, tell me about your
business. Something big, right?

506
00:44:34,844 --> 00:44:37,108
No, no, no. It's a small business.

507
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,949
If you want, we can do something.

508
00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:46,478
I can give you
protection. Personally.

509
00:44:46,956 --> 00:44:49,982
We can work out something,
if you want. Think about it.

510
00:44:52,795 --> 00:44:54,956
I've never seen a bomb blast!

511
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:56,960
How much damage will it do?

512
00:44:57,133 --> 00:44:59,067
Will it destroy
that hut, you think?

513
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:03,371
Easily!
- Damn, this is frigging awesome!

514
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,667
Come on! Let's go blast it!

515
00:45:06,843 --> 00:45:10,438
Right now, right here!
Not gonna sell anyway!

516
00:45:10,847 --> 00:45:13,577
Let's take Tilak, find an
empty place and blast it there.

517
00:45:13,783 --> 00:45:16,980
Wherever! I don't care. It
should cause some serious damage!

518
00:45:23,693 --> 00:45:25,854
Tilak, let'sjust
blast it somewhere here.

519
00:45:25,928 --> 00:45:27,259
Do we need to go out of the city?

520
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,696
Are you crazy? Look
at the crowds here.

521
00:45:29,766 --> 00:45:31,996
So what? We'll blast
it quickly and run.

522
00:45:32,235 --> 00:45:33,497
No one will even know.

523
00:45:33,669 --> 00:45:36,570
Listen to me. Let's go out of
the city and blast it in peace.

524
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:38,305
You guys are such a waste!

525
00:45:38,641 --> 00:45:40,802
What's the use ofblasting
a bomb and causing no damage?

526
00:45:42,612 --> 00:45:44,375
An idea
- let's blast it in the sea.

527
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,946
It'll make a spectacular fountain!

528
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:50,250
Use your head... it will
just go phusssssss in water!

529
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,583
Shut it both of you! We can't
blast it anywhere here. Understood?

530
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:57,758
You both suck! There's no
bloody adventure in you!

531
00:46:04,467 --> 00:46:11,202
''Lifejust goes on...''

532
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:15,970
What tragedy, man! There's no
empty space in all ofMumbai!

533
00:46:48,711 --> 00:46:51,703
What tragedy, man! There's no
empty space in all ofMumbai!

534
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:53,908
Where we can blast
a bomb in peace, no?

535
00:46:54,317 --> 00:46:56,046
Man, what has this city come to!

536
00:46:58,521 --> 00:47:02,423
So what's new? Every week, they
set you up with a new guy anyway.

537
00:47:03,092 --> 00:47:05,686
I'm saying the same thing.
I'mjust fed up of all this.

538
00:47:07,497 --> 00:47:08,725
You can't expect me to find a new
solution

539
00:47:08,798 --> 00:47:09,958
for the same problem every time!

540
00:47:10,967 --> 00:47:13,299
I don't know, yaar. I have
enough problems of my own.

541
00:47:14,837 --> 00:47:17,101
Why do you always get
so riled up about this?

542
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,907
Why do you always bring it up then?

543
00:47:19,408 --> 00:47:20,466
Bring it up?

544
00:47:20,943 --> 00:47:22,934
I'm the one going through
crap at home every day!

545
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:26,104
My family doesn't
care whom I marry,

546
00:47:26,516 --> 00:47:27,676
they just want me
married immediately.

547
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,684
Every day they put a
new joker in front of me!

548
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,985
Look. I don't know about you,

549
00:47:32,355 --> 00:47:34,448
but I am not marrying
some random fool.

550
00:47:34,624 --> 00:47:36,888
Hey, I can't understand!
This is insane!

551
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,824
Who gets married so
early these days, anyway?

552
00:47:39,362 --> 00:47:40,761
If your parents are forcing you,

553
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:43,060
tell them you you're
not interested, dammit!

554
00:47:50,473 --> 00:47:52,839
Please! Now don't
start crying and all.

555
00:47:54,243 --> 00:47:55,642
I'm going crazy enough as it is.

556
00:47:58,981 --> 00:47:59,913
I'm leaving.

557
00:48:16,832 --> 00:48:18,265
You know what to do, right?

558
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:20,426
Yeah, yeah! Don't pull any stunts!
- Got it!

559
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:24,529
And throw it over there, nowhere else!
- I know, man!

560
00:48:24,874 --> 00:48:26,205
You do know what to do, right?

561
00:48:26,275 --> 00:48:28,641
Why are you stressing out? I
just have to press this, right?

562
00:48:28,711 --> 00:48:30,736
This is not a TV, okay?
Be careful, you idiot!

563
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,676
Nothing will happen, relax!
I just have to press here!

564
00:48:55,638 --> 00:48:56,866
Why is it not blasting?

565
00:48:57,473 --> 00:48:58,997
It will, it will.
Give it some time.

566
00:48:59,575 --> 00:49:00,769
It's not a grenade.

567
00:49:00,977 --> 00:49:03,707
You need to light it on the
ground. You shouldn't fling it.

568
00:49:04,914 --> 00:49:07,041
Mandook, go look.

569
00:49:09,352 --> 00:49:10,819
Fuck you! You go look.

570
00:49:12,922 --> 00:49:16,050
I think it's a dud, man!
There's not even a sound.

571
00:49:16,826 --> 00:49:20,694
It doesn't even have
a fuse that goes zzzz,

572
00:49:20,763 --> 00:49:22,287
so we'd know ifit's on or not.

573
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:24,029
Nothing's happening. Go look.

574
00:49:25,868 --> 00:49:26,664
What?

575
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:28,036
Just go look!

576
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:33,467
Sit down, sit down.

577
00:49:45,087 --> 00:49:47,783
Hey! The bomb's switched off!.

578
00:49:56,532 --> 00:49:58,557
What the hell, man?
Don't fool around with me!

579
00:52:06,462 --> 00:52:07,326
The kid!

580
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,957
No! Hey! Tilak! Let's go!

581
00:52:10,032 --> 00:52:13,866
Let's go! We'll get
screwed if someone spots us.

582
00:52:14,303 --> 00:52:18,706
Let's go man! Quick,
quick, let's go!

583
00:52:20,776 --> 00:52:23,745
He's alive, see? Let's
go before someone sees us!

584
00:52:27,383 --> 00:52:28,441
The kid, man!

585
00:52:42,765 --> 00:52:45,097
Yes, yes, I had my dinner. Did you?

586
00:52:46,402 --> 00:52:48,097
Yes, I ate with sir.

587
00:52:49,004 --> 00:52:51,598
Noodles, I ate noodles!

588
00:52:58,747 --> 00:52:59,679
Sir is not in!

589
00:53:02,985 --> 00:53:05,681
Stop! Where do you think you're
going? Please leave! Sir is not in!

590
00:53:12,394 --> 00:53:13,725
Sir, they are not listening.

591
00:53:14,063 --> 00:53:15,894
I tried to stop them...
they just barged in!

592
00:53:38,954 --> 00:53:40,751
What did you think
when you came here?

593
00:53:41,724 --> 00:53:43,988
That you'll come here, start a
business... make a lot of money?

594
00:53:46,495 --> 00:53:47,484
What about us?

595
00:53:48,464 --> 00:53:50,022
You think we don't
deserve to make money?

596
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:53,394
You can't part with half a million?

597
00:53:57,072 --> 00:54:00,041
This dog is worthless.
He's not worth a penny!

598
00:54:01,844 --> 00:54:02,811
But you...

599
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,972
What's half a
million rupees to you?

600
00:54:09,618 --> 00:54:12,143
If we come to know
you don't want to pay...

601
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:14,154
you won't be of any value either.

602
00:54:15,658 --> 00:54:17,888
It won't take me a second to
hack you to pieces right now.

603
00:54:18,394 --> 00:54:22,057
Until this place starts stinking up
no one will even know you're dead.

604
00:54:23,465 --> 00:54:24,454
One more thing...

605
00:54:25,968 --> 00:54:30,405
I didn't kill this dog. You killed him
- over half a million!

606
00:54:30,472 --> 00:54:32,599
And... your girlfriend is next.

607
00:54:36,645 --> 00:54:38,078
You'd better pay up in two days.

608
00:54:38,414 --> 00:54:40,006
We'll tell you where
to bring the money.

609
00:54:40,215 --> 00:54:41,512
1 million rupees.

610
00:54:43,085 --> 00:54:45,883
And please. Don't
go to that inspector.

611
00:54:46,655 --> 00:54:47,883
We will have to line
his pockets too then.

612
00:54:48,023 --> 00:54:49,547
Of course, it will only
go from your pocket.

613
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,855
But it'sjust a lot of
trouble for me, you know?

614
00:54:53,028 --> 00:54:54,689
Okay, sir? Cool? Bye!

615
00:54:55,764 --> 00:54:56,526
Come on!

616
00:54:57,866 --> 00:54:59,857
Hasn't your girlfriend
called you yet from 'foreign'?

617
00:54:59,935 --> 00:55:02,597
Hello darling, how
are you? Miss you!

618
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,167
Mr Sawan Murthy,
what I can do for you?

619
00:55:25,303 --> 00:55:29,034
Sir, I wanted to apply for a
loan... to build career actually...

620
00:55:29,507 --> 00:55:33,443
Actually, I saw your ad for
education loans. So I thought...

621
00:55:33,978 --> 00:55:34,967
Not possible.

622
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:42,183
But Uncle, you told me to
bring Sawan you'd do something?

623
00:55:42,253 --> 00:55:44,244
I know I did. But...

624
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:47,586
Education loans are for
paying tuition fees...

625
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:51,956
And this... cricket... is
hardly education or a career.

626
00:55:52,564 --> 00:55:53,963
You get what I'm saying?

627
00:55:54,632 --> 00:55:58,693
Plus you don't have a
guarantor. Or a guarantee.

628
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:01,604
Sir, there is a guarantor!
Robin can give guarantee!

629
00:56:02,173 --> 00:56:03,640
Of course! I'll personally
give you guarantee.

630
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,471
He'll pay you back for sure.

631
00:56:06,177 --> 00:56:07,610
What will I do with him??

632
00:56:08,947 --> 00:56:10,073
This is not working!

633
00:56:10,515 --> 00:56:12,346
I'll have to figure something else.

634
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:15,684
Savvy, there's a message
- about Sejal.

635
00:56:23,528 --> 00:56:24,995
Check this autorickshaw!

636
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:28,494
No, wrong one. Let's check ahead!

637
00:56:29,033 --> 00:56:30,660
The auto should be on
this road somewhere!

638
00:56:31,336 --> 00:56:32,428
How about this one?

639
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:35,563
Check in this one!

640
00:56:37,575 --> 00:56:39,600
Sejal! Sejal! Stop!

641
00:56:43,715 --> 00:56:45,273
Sejal, I need to talk to you!

642
00:56:46,317 --> 00:56:47,682
But I don't want to talk to you!

643
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:48,684
Who the hell is he?!

644
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:50,448
Who the hell is
he? Do you know him?

645
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:54,349
Stop the auto!
- What are you doing? You'll get hurt!

646
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:59,562
Stop! Stop the auto!
Cut across and stop it!

647
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:08,365
What's your problem? Why
are you making a scene here?

648
00:57:08,439 --> 00:57:10,464
Me?? What do you
think you are doing?!

649
00:57:11,142 --> 00:57:14,578
I told you! That if you didn't
find a solution, this would happen!

650
00:57:19,283 --> 00:57:21,183
- Come on, let's go talk somewhere else.
- No!

651
00:57:21,486 --> 00:57:22,453
Come on, yaar.

652
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,085
I can't come away now.

653
00:57:24,322 --> 00:57:25,186
When then?

654
00:57:26,524 --> 00:57:27,422
I don't know.

655
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:29,084
It doesn't matter to you any more?

656
00:57:30,328 --> 00:57:31,590
Did it ever matter to you?

657
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:34,560
I told you a thousand times
what was going on at home!

658
00:57:34,766 --> 00:57:36,199
Were you even bothered?

659
00:57:38,269 --> 00:57:40,203
Look, Ashok is waiting
for me. I have to go now.

660
00:57:40,705 --> 00:57:42,605
Screw Ashok! Why are you
going around with him?

661
00:57:42,674 --> 00:57:43,766
Because Mom said so.

662
00:57:43,841 --> 00:57:46,173
I don't have any choice
and you don't care!

663
01:00:34,879 --> 01:00:36,312
That was so simple, right?

664
01:00:36,514 --> 01:00:38,948
For so little, you
created such havoc!

665
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:42,308
Sir, sir, sir!

666
01:00:44,222 --> 01:00:46,816
Half a million was our first offer.

667
01:00:47,325 --> 01:00:49,953
You're late, so we
increased the price...

668
01:00:57,668 --> 01:00:59,898
Look at this!
It sparkles!

669
01:00:59,971 --> 01:01:01,768
Don't you worry about
security anymore, sir!

670
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,602
You go on a holiday
with your girlfriend.

671
01:01:03,674 --> 01:01:05,403
We'll meet again for Diwali!

672
01:01:49,854 --> 01:01:51,446
Will you sit for a second, please?

673
01:01:51,822 --> 01:01:54,814
Huh? - Will you sit
for a second, please?

674
01:02:25,623 --> 01:02:27,921
You go on to bed.
I'll come later.

675
01:05:17,995 --> 01:05:21,431
That's the worst
plan I've ever heard!

676
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:23,995
Listen to me, bhaiyya...
It's the perfect plan!

677
01:05:24,068 --> 01:05:25,194
The hell it is perfect.

678
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:27,328
You get caught, you'll
end up perfectly injail.

679
01:05:27,404 --> 01:05:29,099
Listen to the whole
plan first! Then you...

680
01:05:29,173 --> 01:05:31,437
What then? It's not
like suspension in school.

681
01:05:32,443 --> 01:05:35,344
Can youjust listen
to me once, please!

682
01:05:36,313 --> 01:05:38,076
Fine! Tell me your plan.

683
01:05:38,782 --> 01:05:40,044
We need four people.

684
01:05:40,117 --> 01:05:42,711
Two in the bank, one at the
door, one near the bikes.

685
01:05:43,087 --> 01:05:44,315
Bikes?
- Two bikes.

686
01:05:44,788 --> 01:05:46,483
Better than cars in
this horrible traffic!

687
01:05:46,557 --> 01:05:47,683
Bank opens at 10 am.

688
01:05:47,758 --> 01:05:50,192
There are only 3-4 staffers,
including Nattoo Uncle.

689
01:05:50,628 --> 01:05:52,562
Who the hell's Nattoo Uncle?
- He's the watchman.

690
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,530
So what do we do about him?
- That's the best part.

691
01:05:54,665 --> 01:05:56,360
Once he opens the bank,

692
01:05:56,433 --> 01:05:58,458
he doubles at thejewelry
store across the street.

693
01:05:58,769 --> 01:06:00,669
It takes him at least
half an hour to get back.

694
01:06:01,639 --> 01:06:04,540
So for half an hour...
- There's no one guarding the bank!

695
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:08,169
What about security cameras?
- We'll wear scarves.

696
01:06:08,479 --> 01:06:10,413
Everybody wears them...
with all this pollution.

697
01:06:10,714 --> 01:06:12,739
Sejal always wears
it when she's out.

698
01:06:13,017 --> 01:06:14,644
Yeah, there's the
swine flu scare too.

699
01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:17,610
What if the watchman comes back?
- He won't.

700
01:06:17,688 --> 01:06:18,780
What ifhe does?

701
01:06:19,089 --> 01:06:21,421
He has one gun which was made
before even he was born!

702
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:23,459
Plus he's very old.
What can he possibly do?

703
01:06:26,597 --> 01:06:28,189
And what about the customers?

704
01:06:28,265 --> 01:06:29,493
Let's do it on
Ganesh Immersion Day.

705
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:31,692
Bank will be open, but
there won't be many people.

706
01:06:31,769 --> 01:06:35,034
Even if people come, we'll
have guns, knives... something...

707
01:06:35,406 --> 01:06:37,465
Yeah, we'lljust shoot
the bastards down, right?

708
01:06:37,808 --> 01:06:40,242
Err... I was only thinking of
locking them up in the washroom.

709
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,373
So this is your grand plan!

710
01:06:45,482 --> 01:06:46,642
Yes! Perfect, isn't it?

711
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,650
And you want to do this because

712
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:50,584
you want to bribe some
greedy ass selector?

713
01:06:50,654 --> 01:06:53,122
What else? It's the only way
I can get on the cricket team.

714
01:06:53,457 --> 01:06:56,358
My dear boy, it's not
as easy as you think.

715
01:06:56,527 --> 01:06:58,688
Listen to me, focus on your game.

716
01:06:59,263 --> 01:07:01,060
If nothing works out, get ajob!

717
01:07:01,465 --> 01:07:05,401
Wh? do you want to
become like (me)... them?

718
01:07:08,205 --> 01:07:09,570
Wants to rob a frigging bank!

719
01:07:10,474 --> 01:07:11,839
Everybody wants a shortcut.

720
01:07:12,076 --> 01:07:13,509
What will happen to this country?!

721
01:07:16,413 --> 01:07:17,744
- Rambalak?!
- I have no idea.

722
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:20,474
I heard he's gone back to
his village with his wife.

723
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:22,812
He doesn't know anything,
sir. Someone killed him!

724
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,653
And the police won't do anything!

725
01:07:24,722 --> 01:07:25,882
You be careful too!

726
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:28,722
Once these people latch on to you,
they don't let go that easily!

727
01:07:29,226 --> 01:07:32,093
Hello, sir! How are you,
sir? How's your girlfriend?

728
01:07:33,664 --> 01:07:35,689
Sir, I have another
business proposal for you!

729
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:38,101
Alittle more expensive...
What say, sir?

730
01:07:38,369 --> 01:07:40,234
I'll come and meet you
in a couple of days...

731
01:09:50,467 --> 01:09:52,196
Do you need anything?
- Huh?

732
01:09:52,703 --> 01:09:53,670
Some tea?

733
01:09:54,104 --> 01:09:56,299
No, I have some work.

734
01:10:05,015 --> 01:10:06,414
What are you reading?
- What?

735
01:10:09,553 --> 01:10:11,111
What book are you reading?

736
01:10:11,188 --> 01:10:13,315
Oh it's nothing...

737
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:15,952
We print these at our press.

738
01:10:16,226 --> 01:10:18,990
I've read this book...
when I was in school.

739
01:10:22,032 --> 01:10:22,726
What?

740
01:10:24,635 --> 01:10:25,727
You can read?

741
01:10:26,437 --> 01:10:29,463
Of course! I went to college.

742
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:33,275
I read this book when I was...

743
01:10:34,411 --> 01:10:35,708
in the 10th grade.

744
01:10:37,347 --> 01:10:38,974
It's so interesting, right?

745
01:10:39,616 --> 01:10:44,019
That kid looks for treasure all
over but later he finds out...

746
01:10:45,456 --> 01:10:47,356
You... haven't reached
that part yet, right?

747
01:10:47,491 --> 01:10:49,288
No.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!

748
01:10:52,796 --> 01:10:55,492
But do finish it.
You'll enjoy it.

749
01:10:59,603 --> 01:11:02,401
You went to college??
- Yes.

750
01:11:04,141 --> 01:11:06,075
I didn't know you went to college.

751
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:08,778
You never asked!

752
01:11:19,019 --> 01:11:21,954
You need your hand in many pies,
only then can you see some money.

753
01:11:22,223 --> 01:11:25,249
You need to keep your options!

754
01:11:25,693 --> 01:11:27,661
Huh? Hold on, let me ask.

755
01:11:28,028 --> 01:11:30,758
Hey! How much is 4000
dollars in rupees?

756
01:11:32,066 --> 01:11:34,762
Ey Tipu, enough already! Come here.

757
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,804
I am busy right
now. Call you later.

758
01:11:40,774 --> 01:11:41,900
Show them the stash.

759
01:11:49,683 --> 01:11:51,173
What is this?
- Goods.

760
01:11:51,652 --> 01:11:52,949
What is this?
- Goods.

761
01:11:53,921 --> 01:11:56,788
Ey, Tipu, are you
here to buy or sell?

762
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:00,290
Well... we did come to sell...

763
01:12:00,995 --> 01:12:03,054
But... show them.

764
01:12:04,298 --> 01:12:05,060
Show.

765
01:12:23,684 --> 01:12:26,812
Mandook, let's show
them the big one!

766
01:12:26,987 --> 01:12:28,887
You'll get top price
it's a rare item.

767
01:12:29,456 --> 01:12:32,482
Are you crazy? How do you
have the heart to sell it?!

768
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,524
We have to show something.
It's a matter of pride now.

769
01:12:35,863 --> 01:12:39,094
Think about the money also. - Fine,
whatever! Don't chew my brains!

770
01:12:46,974 --> 01:12:48,635
What is this?
- The real stuff!.

771
01:12:49,109 --> 01:12:51,168
Where did you get it?
- What do you care?

772
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:52,839
Do you want it or not?

773
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,513
It's a risk, but take it.

774
01:12:54,782 --> 01:12:56,875
Sixty. - Sixty
what? - Thousand.

775
01:12:56,951 --> 01:12:59,511
You fucking miser. You
think we are beggars or what?

776
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:02,917
Fucking shorty, you talk too
much. I'll shoot your fucking face.

777
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:04,981
They are amateurs.
Please forgive them.

778
01:13:05,059 --> 01:13:07,084
Put a leash on the short
one. It barks too much.

779
01:13:09,163 --> 01:13:10,892
Don't know how to do business.

780
01:13:11,565 --> 01:13:13,499
Sorry, sorry!
Shut up, Mandook!

781
01:13:14,802 --> 01:13:16,963
If not you, who else
will they learn from?

782
01:13:17,104 --> 01:13:18,799
Yeah! Like it's my job
to teach the fuckers!

783
01:13:19,106 --> 01:13:21,973
They'll learn slowly!
I apologize on their behalf.

784
01:13:22,609 --> 01:13:24,133
They think they are
bloody gangsters.

785
01:13:24,211 --> 01:13:26,179
Shit, I didn't expect this.

786
01:13:26,647 --> 01:13:28,774
Had no idea they were selling too!

787
01:13:29,016 --> 01:13:30,813
What a waste of time!

788
01:13:31,118 --> 01:13:33,780
Not really.
I swiped some bullets!

789
01:13:34,254 --> 01:13:36,017
When the hell did you flick this!?

790
01:13:36,757 --> 01:13:40,625
You idiot, if you get caught,
they'll fucking gut us!

791
01:13:40,694 --> 01:13:42,286
They won't do shit.

792
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:45,663
They're morons, standing
around with their zipper open!

793
01:13:46,767 --> 01:13:49,235
Let's try the bullets in these guns!
- Save this idiot!

794
01:13:51,505 --> 01:13:53,268
Savvy! I was calculating...

795
01:13:53,741 --> 01:13:55,504
So far only 7 people
have played well.

796
01:13:55,776 --> 01:13:58,108
That means 8 slots are still open!

797
01:13:58,779 --> 01:14:03,842
So 60 minus 7... equal
to 53, divided by 8 is...

798
01:14:04,284 --> 01:14:05,911
Oh, chuck the calculations...

799
01:14:06,086 --> 01:14:08,646
Just play the next
two matches well!

800
01:14:08,822 --> 01:14:10,517
At least one match?!

801
01:14:48,796 --> 01:14:50,127
What happened to your nose?

802
01:14:50,197 --> 01:14:51,323
You won't talk to me?

803
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:54,732
Savvy, everybody's home.

804
01:14:54,802 --> 01:14:56,702
Mom keeps coming up here to check.

805
01:15:00,707 --> 01:15:03,835
Why are you acting like this?
You still love me, right?

806
01:15:06,747 --> 01:15:08,305
Why don't you stand up to your mom?

807
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:11,242
Quit going out with that cartoon!

808
01:15:11,985 --> 01:15:13,976
Has he left?

809
01:15:20,627 --> 01:15:21,958
I got engaged to him yesterday.

810
01:15:26,066 --> 01:15:27,090
What the hell?!

811
01:15:29,103 --> 01:15:30,570
Why didn't you tell me?!

812
01:15:39,713 --> 01:15:40,907
Savvy, it hurts, please...

813
01:15:56,263 --> 01:15:57,855
Anything on the team selections?

814
01:16:26,927 --> 01:16:27,951
Hello, sir!

815
01:16:28,262 --> 01:16:29,126
How are you?

816
01:16:29,196 --> 01:16:31,096
What do you want,
sir? I have everything.

817
01:16:31,932 --> 01:16:34,901
Powder, girls...
- I want something else.

818
01:16:35,035 --> 01:16:36,900
Sure, come with me.

819
01:16:38,138 --> 01:16:41,369
Sir you want girls?
Indian, Russian, Urkanian...

820
01:16:44,645 --> 01:16:45,634
You want what?!

821
01:16:46,113 --> 01:16:48,274
No way. Too dangerous.

822
01:16:48,682 --> 01:16:49,979
I don't deal with that stuff.

823
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,378
No sir, I don't.

824
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,089
You want coke, I can get
you top quality stuff.

825
01:16:57,157 --> 01:16:58,146
Do it right here if you want.

826
01:16:58,292 --> 01:17:00,760
You want a girl, let me
know. That's all I can do.

827
01:17:15,475 --> 01:17:18,706
You know Fashion Street?
Meet me there tonight.

828
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:23,149
Our branch office at this traffic
signal has very strong sales.

829
01:17:23,984 --> 01:17:26,009
Autorickshaws are not
allowed beyond this signal.

830
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:27,211
Only taxis and cars.

831
01:17:28,021 --> 01:17:30,216
These are all well educated
people from good families.

832
01:17:30,857 --> 01:17:32,791
I always have at least
four kids working here!

833
01:17:34,995 --> 01:17:36,223
Hey Salim! Come here...

834
01:17:37,898 --> 01:17:38,865
He's a nice kid.

835
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:42,161
Go, get to work now.

836
01:17:43,637 --> 01:17:45,730
There's a new bestseller
coming from Chintan Gandhi.

837
01:17:46,773 --> 01:17:48,536
And we'll be the first
to sell that book!

838
01:17:48,842 --> 01:17:50,469
Right here at these
traffic signals.

839
01:17:51,011 --> 01:17:52,603
We are going to make
a lot of money from it.

840
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:55,170
We'll be the only ones
to sell that book first.

841
01:17:55,649 --> 01:17:56,843
Not even bookstores.

842
01:17:58,151 --> 01:18:02,144
We'll buy a big car
within the year. Nano!

843
01:18:02,689 --> 01:18:05,624
Next year, we'll be stuck
in traffic just like this,

844
01:18:05,892 --> 01:18:07,723
but in an AC car!

845
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:12,698
You are engaged, your wedding
is fixed for next month!

846
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,991
Now you tell me you
don't feel like it!

847
01:18:15,569 --> 01:18:17,161
Do you think this
is some kind of game?

848
01:18:17,804 --> 01:18:20,068
You never cared for your studies.
You never helped out at home.

849
01:18:20,774 --> 01:18:22,264
You don't even have
a bloody degree.

850
01:18:22,643 --> 01:18:24,736
I've spent so much money on you.

851
01:18:25,178 --> 01:18:28,079
Have you gone to the gym
even once? Look at you.

852
01:18:28,582 --> 01:18:29,981
Look how fat you are!

853
01:18:30,617 --> 01:18:31,982
Open the door right now! Sejal!

854
01:18:32,919 --> 01:18:35,114
Sejal! Open the door I said!

855
01:18:36,023 --> 01:18:38,253
You don't deserve this alliance.

856
01:18:39,526 --> 01:18:43,656
They are such nice people.
Look at your arrogance!

857
01:18:44,998 --> 01:18:46,192
What do I tell them now?

858
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:47,929
Will you come out or not?

859
01:18:48,168 --> 01:18:49,931
Why don't you tell me
what your problem is?

860
01:18:50,003 --> 01:18:51,937
You're going to
ruin our reputation.

861
01:19:17,564 --> 01:19:18,826
He'll be here any minute.

862
01:19:19,633 --> 01:19:20,861
Okay I'll go now.

863
01:19:35,882 --> 01:19:37,213
Are you going to kill someone?

864
01:19:38,285 --> 01:19:40,685
Actually, don't tell me.

865
01:19:43,657 --> 01:19:45,249
You don't plan to
kill yourself, do you?

866
01:19:46,126 --> 01:19:47,718
There, that's him!

867
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:54,163
How far?

868
01:19:55,102 --> 01:19:56,296
You got the moolah?

869
01:20:04,711 --> 01:20:06,576
The client is ready.
Are the goods ready?

870
01:20:07,814 --> 01:20:08,712
Where?

871
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:10,811
Okay.

872
01:20:34,741 --> 01:20:35,503
Get in.

873
01:20:47,854 --> 01:20:48,650
What?

874
01:20:52,826 --> 01:20:53,758
Do your thing.

875
01:20:55,495 --> 01:20:57,486
Does it work?

876
01:20:58,498 --> 01:21:00,466
Local stuff... Looks cheap.

877
01:21:00,801 --> 01:21:02,962
But you get it going,
it'll rip everything apart!

878
01:21:04,504 --> 01:21:07,803
We just tested it an
hour ago. It works great!

879
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:09,698
You plan on shooting someone?

880
01:21:10,444 --> 01:21:12,036
No, it's just for security.

881
01:21:13,547 --> 01:21:15,014
Do whatever.

882
01:21:17,417 --> 01:21:19,078
Just don't get caught with the gun.

883
01:21:19,152 --> 01:21:21,746
Else the cops will catch us.

884
01:21:22,722 --> 01:21:24,553
Sir, this is falling short.

885
01:21:28,228 --> 01:21:29,422
Here, count it.

886
01:21:31,731 --> 01:21:34,029
Yes, we have those too.

887
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:36,764
It will cost you more.

888
01:21:38,138 --> 01:21:40,003
We take dollars too!

889
01:21:52,252 --> 01:21:54,948
No, no, setting fire to
buses is not my thing.

890
01:21:55,455 --> 01:21:57,685
My boys can do protests,
riots, but no blowing up stuff.

891
01:21:58,525 --> 01:21:59,924
Can't you take no for an answer?

892
01:22:00,093 --> 01:22:01,788
Now let me party in peace.

893
01:22:18,478 --> 01:22:21,003
Got you a sweet deal, didn't I?
- Superb deal.

894
01:22:21,515 --> 01:22:22,914
You still have the long one?

895
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:26,484
Sure. But I don't want to
sell it, it's my pet...

896
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,182
We might need it for a job.

897
01:22:28,555 --> 01:22:29,579
What?
- Whatjob?

898
01:22:29,956 --> 01:22:32,823
Solid plan, sure shot
job. Lot of money.

899
01:22:33,527 --> 01:22:34,221
How much?

900
01:22:34,661 --> 01:22:36,822
- We need one more man.
- Where's your friend Tilak?

901
01:22:37,097 --> 01:22:39,964
Since he got married, his
wife has him on a short leash!

902
01:22:42,302 --> 01:22:44,532
Do you have bullets
for the long one?

903
01:22:44,704 --> 01:22:47,298
That's the problem. Can
you set me up with some?

904
01:22:49,309 --> 01:22:51,072
I was born for this shit!

905
01:22:53,213 --> 01:22:54,646
You call Tilak first.

906
01:23:01,955 --> 01:23:04,549
Enough! We are almost
home. I'll eat there.

907
01:23:04,624 --> 01:23:05,955
It's okay. Just one more...

908
01:23:18,071 --> 01:23:18,867
Book?

909
01:23:19,539 --> 01:23:20,437
What book?!

910
01:23:20,974 --> 01:23:24,034
Man, what a book!
You should read it.

911
01:23:24,844 --> 01:23:26,709
You've been sitting at
home reading a book!?

912
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:29,010
Is it in Hindi?
- No, English...

913
01:23:29,549 --> 01:23:30,641
What philosophy!

914
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:33,476
Western philosophy
is something else!

915
01:23:33,887 --> 01:23:35,115
We barely know how
to spell philosophy!

916
01:23:35,355 --> 01:23:38,916
So... you won't help us
because you're reading a book?

917
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:40,656
Not like that, man...

918
01:23:46,566 --> 01:23:50,900
Listen... A man never
does what he wants...

919
01:23:51,838 --> 01:23:55,968
...but he becomes what he does.

920
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:58,343
What??

921
01:23:58,612 --> 01:24:00,671
Listen... In life...

922
01:24:00,747 --> 01:24:03,477
What nonsense are you blabbering?!
Have you totally lost it?

923
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,581
Brother, please
don't do this to us!

924
01:24:06,052 --> 01:24:08,418
It's a lot of money
and we need your help...

925
01:24:09,456 --> 01:24:12,016
Enough is enough! I can't
do this stuff any more.

926
01:24:13,693 --> 01:24:14,625
Now on, I will focus on...
I'll dedicate my life to...

927
01:24:14,694 --> 01:24:18,494
Fuck life and fuck your
philosophy! Let's go, he's lost it!

928
01:24:18,798 --> 01:24:21,926
Wait... It really
is a very good book.

929
01:24:22,869 --> 01:24:25,531
Hard to read at first.
There are big words and all.

930
01:24:25,905 --> 01:24:28,772
But once you get going,
you won't put it down!

931
01:24:29,042 --> 01:24:32,500
Now I know why people spend
so much and read fat books!

932
01:24:34,447 --> 01:24:35,675
What philosophy, yaar!

933
01:24:35,849 --> 01:24:38,977
Does your book also teach you
how to screw over friends?!

934
01:24:47,427 --> 01:24:48,826
You both take one copy each.

935
01:24:53,633 --> 01:24:55,100
I have lots of copies lying around.

936
01:26:08,675 --> 01:26:09,801
Come, in, quick!

937
01:26:12,879 --> 01:26:16,940
Mandook, no over-smart
stuff!. We'll keep it simple.

938
01:26:18,618 --> 01:26:20,279
You listening?!
- Sure. Here, take these...

939
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:26,190
I'm here only for moral support.

940
01:26:26,693 --> 01:26:28,558
Moral what?
- Nonviolence.

941
01:26:32,198 --> 01:26:33,324
Guys, let's be quick.

942
01:26:33,767 --> 01:26:37,567
I need to go home for
Ganesh Immersion. - What?

943
01:26:43,009 --> 01:26:45,000
Don't you dare move!

944
01:26:45,278 --> 01:26:47,678
Come on. Let's go.

945
01:26:49,048 --> 01:26:51,209
Don't you dare move!

946
01:26:51,284 --> 01:26:53,844
Uncle, move this way...
We've hijacked the bank!

947
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,751
Come on, out! Come on!

948
01:26:56,089 --> 01:26:57,420
No stupid ness.

949
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:59,856
Uncle, We've hijacked the bank.
Will I Give you in written.

950
01:27:00,193 --> 01:27:01,251
Hey you too.

951
01:27:01,427 --> 01:27:03,327
Move aside him, C'mon.

952
01:27:03,396 --> 01:27:08,356
Nobody move. Everyone, into the
bathroom! Where's the bathroom?

953
01:27:08,434 --> 01:27:11,403
Get the money, quick. Tell him!

954
01:27:11,471 --> 01:27:13,462
Give me your mobiles.

955
01:27:13,673 --> 01:27:15,334
All of you, quick!

956
01:27:15,542 --> 01:27:17,271
Fast, you too.

957
01:27:17,343 --> 01:27:20,039
Hey, all of you go in the bathroom.

958
01:27:20,213 --> 01:27:21,145
Go inside.

959
01:27:21,414 --> 01:27:22,938
Go in the bathroom.
- This is gents bathroom.

960
01:27:23,116 --> 01:27:25,209
Madam, adjust for today.

961
01:27:25,351 --> 01:27:27,114
C'mon.

962
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,654
Fast close it. Close.

963
01:27:35,328 --> 01:27:37,159
What is this?

964
01:27:38,264 --> 01:27:39,356
That's all there is.

965
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:41,423
Eight thousand rupees? And change??

966
01:27:41,835 --> 01:27:44,702
You think I'm an idiot?
- Don't think we're not fools!

967
01:27:44,871 --> 01:27:46,031
Where's the money?

968
01:27:46,306 --> 01:27:48,331
Why do you want to die
for someone else's money?

969
01:27:49,442 --> 01:27:50,875
It's in the locker.

970
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:52,407
Open the locker then.

971
01:27:52,745 --> 01:27:54,144
The manager has the keys.

972
01:27:54,747 --> 01:27:56,942
Who the hell are you?
- Assistant Manager.

973
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:58,374
Call the manager.

974
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:01,720
Today is Ganesha
Immersion. He will be late.

975
01:28:02,856 --> 01:28:04,153
He'll be here in two minutes.

976
01:28:04,324 --> 01:28:06,849
Two minutes-two minutes?
Or 30 minutes-two minutes?

977
01:28:07,393 --> 01:28:08,257
15 minutes.

978
01:28:10,129 --> 01:28:12,393
We'll wait.
- Huh? - Huh?

979
01:28:12,999 --> 01:28:14,296
Till the manager comes.

980
01:28:14,367 --> 01:28:18,167
If he doesn't come
in 15, you're dead!

981
01:28:20,306 --> 01:28:21,466
It's a one-way street.

982
01:28:27,947 --> 01:28:30,177
It's one-way!

983
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:32,008
Step out. Show me your license!

984
01:28:45,598 --> 01:28:48,032
I'm only doing this for friendship.

985
01:28:48,601 --> 01:28:50,364
I don't care about
money these days.

986
01:28:50,904 --> 01:28:53,031
Right. Why don't you
donate all your money then?

987
01:28:53,506 --> 01:28:55,565
I will do just that!
I don't want this money!

988
01:28:56,542 --> 01:28:59,409
Then why don't we reduce
your share to zero?!

989
01:28:59,612 --> 01:29:00,840
Do whatever you want.

990
01:29:02,448 --> 01:29:03,574
Shit, yaar!

991
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:06,347
I have to go home and
rethink my whole life!

992
01:29:24,737 --> 01:29:27,205
- Two more minutes please...
- Two more minutes again?!

993
01:29:31,143 --> 01:29:33,304
Hey, Uncle! Where are you
going? The bank is closed!

994
01:29:33,379 --> 01:29:35,347
Why is it closed?
It's open today!

995
01:29:35,615 --> 01:29:37,583
I tell you it's a bank
holiday! Go home!

996
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:39,140
What bank holiday? Why?

997
01:29:39,352 --> 01:29:40,580
Uncle, it's Ganesh Immersion day!

998
01:29:40,653 --> 01:29:42,416
It's a national holiday in Mumbai!

999
01:29:42,488 --> 01:29:44,922
I know it's Immersion Day, but I
checked. The bank is open today!

1000
01:29:46,459 --> 01:29:47,483
Who is it, man?

1001
01:29:48,561 --> 01:29:50,426
Some old man... He's not leaving!

1002
01:29:50,897 --> 01:29:52,626
That fucker Tipu! Why
didn't he stop him?

1003
01:29:52,698 --> 01:29:54,632
Don't know what the
hell he's doing outside!

1004
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:58,466
You know what, let'sjust wait
here. He'll leave on his own!

1005
01:30:02,909 --> 01:30:05,173
You moron! Where are you going?!

1006
01:30:06,245 --> 01:30:07,439
He'll get us killed!

1007
01:30:11,017 --> 01:30:13,747
Hey, Uncle! Can't you
see the bank is closed?

1008
01:30:13,819 --> 01:30:15,753
That's what I'm asking...
Why is it closed today?!

1009
01:30:15,821 --> 01:30:17,618
Come on, head to the bathroom!
- Move it!

1010
01:30:21,027 --> 01:30:23,621
Rascals! They took
away my brand new phone!

1011
01:30:24,497 --> 01:30:26,260
I shouldn't have come
to the bank today!

1012
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:29,858
I deposit 1,000 rupees
every month here as SIP.

1013
01:30:30,403 --> 01:30:31,392
You think it's all gone?

1014
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:32,869
Gone! Yourmoney's gone!

1015
01:30:53,893 --> 01:30:55,326
Final two minutes, please!

1016
01:30:55,494 --> 01:30:57,655
That's it. I've had
enough of yournonsense!

1017
01:30:57,730 --> 01:30:58,719
You're dead meat.

1018
01:30:59,332 --> 01:31:00,594
He's here!

1019
01:31:02,768 --> 01:31:05,464
Move it!
- Yeah, move it!

1020
01:31:06,005 --> 01:31:06,937
Open it!

1021
01:31:08,841 --> 01:31:09,637
Open it!

1022
01:31:10,876 --> 01:31:12,605
There's shitloads here!

1023
01:31:13,012 --> 01:31:15,776
Take it all out!

1024
01:31:19,585 --> 01:31:21,610
We won the lottery!

1025
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:27,482
Didn't anyone call the cops?

1026
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,926
No, they took away all our
phones! How can we call?

1027
01:31:30,363 --> 01:31:31,057
Really?

1028
01:31:32,565 --> 01:31:33,998
They didn't take mine!

1029
01:31:34,834 --> 01:31:37,598
Hello Ma? The police station
number... Yes, the police!

1030
01:31:37,803 --> 01:31:40,101
No, Mother, why would I call
you ifI knew the number?!

1031
01:31:59,025 --> 01:32:02,051
Tilak! See!

1032
01:32:02,628 --> 01:32:04,459
Have you ever seen this much money!

1033
01:32:05,431 --> 01:32:06,728
Come on, come on, let's go!

1034
01:32:07,066 --> 01:32:09,967
No one move till we leave.
- Come on, let's go!

1035
01:32:10,136 --> 01:32:14,038
If anyone tells the cops, you
want to see what I'll do to you?

1036
01:32:23,649 --> 01:32:25,446
What the hell! Have you lost it?

1037
01:32:46,138 --> 01:32:49,733
Come on, let's leave!
- Oh my god, Tilak!

1038
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:58,511
People will start
coming in, let's go!

1039
01:32:58,751 --> 01:33:01,379
Let's go. The cops are coming...

1040
01:33:15,868 --> 01:33:18,268
There, there!
They're the robbers!

1041
01:34:17,429 --> 01:34:18,623
I'll call the ambulance.

1042
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:22,094
Put the money in the vault first.

1043
01:34:55,367 --> 01:34:57,130
Take him to the
hospital right away.

1044
01:34:58,571 --> 01:35:00,471
Open the door! Is
anybody out there?

1045
01:35:29,001 --> 01:35:32,402
Please, sir. Don't shoot us, sir.

1046
01:35:32,972 --> 01:35:35,440
We didn't do it on purpose.

1047
01:35:35,975 --> 01:35:38,535
We have nothing. We
had to do that to survive.

1048
01:35:42,748 --> 01:35:43,908
You want yourmoney back?

1049
01:35:49,421 --> 01:35:52,288
Calm down, sir. We'll
bring it right away!

1050
01:36:08,073 --> 01:36:09,665
You've really come to kill us?

1051
01:36:10,075 --> 01:36:11,474
If you do, you won't
get away with it!

1052
01:36:11,543 --> 01:36:12,703
Here you go, sir.

1053
01:36:12,878 --> 01:36:14,743
It's all in there, sir.
Count it if you want.

1054
01:36:52,484 --> 01:36:53,576
Motherf!.

1055
01:36:54,887 --> 01:36:56,411
I'm gonna kill the bastard!

1056
01:36:57,456 --> 01:37:00,118
Get the guns! Bring me the guns!

1057
01:38:12,664 --> 01:38:15,360
...what other business yields
returns as quickly as cricket?!

1058
01:38:15,701 --> 01:38:18,431
You are ash, you are fire.

1059
01:38:18,504 --> 01:38:20,597
I'll arrange for the money
as soon as possible, sir.

1060
01:38:22,741 --> 01:38:26,404
''You can harm yourself,
you can safeguard yourself.''

1061
01:38:26,578 --> 01:38:29,843
You alone decide your outcome.

1062
01:38:29,915 --> 01:38:32,008
''You are connected
with the universe,''

1063
01:38:32,084 --> 01:38:34,052
''why this disconnect
with yourself?.''

1064
01:38:34,353 --> 01:38:38,380
''Realize now... God
lies within you!''

1065
01:38:39,091 --> 01:38:45,826
Realize now... In chaos lies peace!

1066
01:38:46,965 --> 01:38:53,734
Realize now... In
destruction, lies passion!

1067
01:39:38,016 --> 01:39:40,541
Sawan, what happened?!

1068
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,417
What did he say?

1069
01:39:43,622 --> 01:39:45,556
Oh, you didn't give him the money?!

1070
01:39:45,891 --> 01:39:47,381
What are we gonna do with it?!

1071
01:39:47,559 --> 01:39:49,083
- Why aren't you saying anything?
- Come,

1072
01:39:49,161 --> 01:39:50,389
let's go practice.

1073
01:43:20,472 --> 01:43:21,962
Yes, the protest is
in full swing now.

1074
01:43:22,974 --> 01:43:24,908
Haven't you guys had your
breakfast? Shout louder!

1075
01:43:24,976 --> 01:43:27,171
Down with Vasant Kamble!!

1076
01:43:43,328 --> 01:43:45,956
I'm not kidding! I'll set
myself on fire! I'm serious!

1077
01:43:46,698 --> 01:43:47,756
Hail Maharashtra!

1078
01:43:50,736 --> 01:43:54,433
I am not kidding, you bastard!
Come out right now!!
