1
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,083
Yeah, Sweetty?

2
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,875
Perfume? Now you want another one?
You just bought one the other day.

3
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,500
Listen, I'm not a millionaire's son, okay?
I work my ass off for money.

4
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,208
I am busy right now.

5
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:04,417
What do you mean "where"?
With a customer, of course.

6
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,292
Okay, hang up now.
I am getting another call.

7
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:18,583
<i>Life is bloody unpredictable.</i>

8
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,375
<i>On some days, I fuck with everyone.
On some days, life fucks me over.</i>

9
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,250
<i>Life is great if you've got two things
with you.</i>

10
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,833
<i>Luck and fuck.</i>

11
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,833
<i>When your luck gets you a good fuck...</i>

12
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,458
<i>Fuck! That's amazing!</i>

13
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:30,583
<i>But when your bloody luck runs out...
that's when life fucks you over!</i>

14
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:31,917
Give me the key.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,458
<i>Luck and fuck.</i>

16
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,000
So, are you a Russian or Chinese?

17
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:53,083
I'm a Russian.

18
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,042
Russian from top to toe.

19
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,167
How so?

20
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:05,083
You'll see.

21
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,875
<i>Right now, I'd say,
I'm getting really lucky.</i>

22
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:16,625
<i>In India, only 30 percent of women
undress completely during sex.</i>

23
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,542
<i>The remaining 70 percent,
just lift their sari up.</i>

24
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,542
Putin! Smirnoff!

25
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:29,667
Moscow! Gorbachev!

26
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:35,000
<i>Till now, I've been stuck with
one from the 70 percent.</i>

27
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,417
<i>Same bloody position every time.</i>

28
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,958
<i>But ever since I've had Simmi...</i>

29
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:44,167
<i>I have tried them all.</i>

30
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,833
<i>Especially doggy style.
Well, that's my weakness.</i>

31
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,750
Look how smooth you are.

32
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,042
Even girls are hairier than you.

33
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,042
Your phone's always vibrating.

34
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,208
Do you use it as a dildo?

35
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:12,958
Hello.

36
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,250
Your wife.

37
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,875
I've been trying your phone
for three hours. Who was that girl?

38
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,167
- A customer!
- Customer?

39
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,333
It's a fuckin' lingerie shop.
All my customers are girls.

40
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,917
Anyway, where's the fire?

41
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:45,875
Holy shit! How many times have I told you
not to cover Grandpa?

42
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,250
He'll die of suffocation one day!

43
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:51,708
Yeah, okay. I get it.
Why are you getting all riled up?

44
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,875
C'mon, take my selfie.

45
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,000
Hey!

46
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,583
- Grandpa will be suffocated, baby!
- Have you gone crazy?

47
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,167
- He is our grandpa. What's the harm in it?
- It does.

48
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,292
Have some respect for his age.

49
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,958
I have been looking after both of you
for eight years.

50
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,792
I have had enough.
You know, I need some respect too.

51
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:13,042
Now, take my selfie, I want to send it.

52
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,417
Who do you want to send
your half-naked photo to?

53
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,958
- To the Weightover guys.
- Weightover?

54
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,792
Yes, it is a weight loss program.

55
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,583
They'll make me a size zero
within 15 days.

56
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,625
Why the fuck do you
need to lose weight now?

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,208
The stupid soap operas you watch
are driving you crazy.

58
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,583
Yes, they are.
They have such a great offer.

59
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,625
Within the weight loss fee,
they've promised a dimple on my cheek.

60
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,958
Everyone says I look just like
that new movie star minus her dimples.

61
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, really?

62
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,708
And where are you getting the dough
for all this denting work?

63
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:47,375
Where else? You will pay for it.
Look, you'll love the deal here.

64
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,458
They are offering a 20 percent discount
for the best before and after photo.

65
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,458
Mine is obviously going to be the best.

66
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,583
Now will you click the picture,
or shall I call the neighbors?

67
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,542
They will all come here running.

68
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,583
<i>But for now, it's I who must run.</i>

69
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,125
<i>Nope, this ain't a morning jog,
you morons.</i>

70
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,167
<i>On some days, I fuck with everyone.
On some days, life fucks me over.</i>

71
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,000
<i>Today is just one of those days.</i>

72
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,500
Hey! Hey! What the fuck, man?

73
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,792
Where are you taking my car?
I'll pay for the parking.

74
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,792
So now you want to pay for the parking?

75
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:22,458
And when are you going to pay the bank?
You never pick your phone up,

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,500
so now I'm picking your car up.

77
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,958
So, you... You are from the bank, sir?

78
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,250
But I have just three instalments
pending now.

79
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:30,750
Three?

80
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,500
What have you been smoking? You have
six full outstanding installments.

81
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,875
Six? Give me a minute.

82
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,792
Six? Which bank are you from, sir?

83
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,000
Six.

84
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,417
So, you are from the Bank of Punjab, sir!

85
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,250
- Yes!
- Well, what luck!

86
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,333
Look here. I was going to make
a deposit tomorrow.

87
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,750
I have marked it in my diary and all.
Here, have a look.

88
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,208
Have you spared any bank at all?

89
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,792
I'll definitely pay the installments
tomorrow. Please don't tow my car, sir.

90
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,083
I'm letting you go today.
But if you don't pay by tomorrow,

91
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,792
I'll tow away your whole fuckin' ass
along with your shitty car.

92
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,375
Hey, drop it!

93
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:14,458
Hey! Easy! What the fuck!

94
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,333
Hello? Hello?

95
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:37,708
Suri, sir. Hello, sir.
I'm really running low on cash.

96
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,542
Yes. What? Give me a minute.

97
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,292
Hello. Shall I see you now?

98
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,417
Okay, I'll be there in no time.

99
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,917
Shut up! Shut up!

100
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,625
You know, lending money to friends
is like raising a pig.

101
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,417
You keep feeding it
and only get shit in return.

102
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,167
Nope. Never saw any benefit in that.

103
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,208
But there's a special scheme
I can offer you.

104
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,625
Oi! Fucker, get Sonam.

105
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,625
The gown's a fuckin' rage right now!

106
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,292
Sonam wore the same design
in her last film.

107
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,917
People are lining up to pay 40,000
apiece.

108
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,000
The whole stock has just vanished
from the market.

109
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,417
But you know me, held onto the last batch
of these babies.

110
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,625
Got these especially from a designer
in Mumbai.

111
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,042
Big fuckin' margins. Pick them.
20,000 apiece, just for you.

112
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:49,250
That's very nice. But what will I do
with these. I run a lingerie shop.

113
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:53,083
Here's a chance to do something better
than selling panties all your life.

114
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,042
Listen to me carefully.

115
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,875
You have ladies thronging your shop
the entire day.

116
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:01,708
Display the gown prominently
on your counter. Sonam-style wedding gown.

117
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,125
They'll get wet just looking at it.

118
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,625
There's an attractive offer also.

119
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:12,625
If you pick more than 100 pieces,
we give you an iPhone 6S for free.

120
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,125
Free.

121
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:18,792
One hundred and twenty-five pieces,
at 20,000 each.

122
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:21,667
That makes it 2.5 million total.
What do you say?

123
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,417
Okay, then. Give me 10 pieces.

124
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,000
Fuck you, motherfucker.

125
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,917
You know what, it's not for you.
Oi! Take it away.

126
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:34,167
I always knew you never had any balls
anyway.

127
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:37,250
Sir, please. Please listen to me.
This 2.5 million can change my life.

128
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:42,167
I need some fuckin' miracle to happen.
You know I've got nothing here.

129
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,583
A miracle?

130
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,667
Okay! Let's see if my old magic wand
rises anymore.

131
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,958
Raghu, M'lord! Suri here.

132
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,042
What do you mean why did I chop off
the finger? You agreed a date, right?

133
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,000
How many fingers do you have now?

134
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,042
Nine, right? And what was the due date?
Ninth.

135
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,000
See! Now it'll be easier for you
to remember your due dates.

136
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,917
Okay. I'm hanging up now. Have a good day.

137
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,417
Hello, Mr. Gupta!
So you're the bra-panty guy?

138
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,083
See, your loan is pre-approved.

139
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,333
- Suri said 2.5 million, right?
- Yes.

140
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:29,042
Here you go! It's all fresh and ready.
Five, ten, 15, 20, 25.

141
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:32,417
It's all yours.

142
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,167
Excuse me for a minute.

143
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:43,333
Yeah, tell me. Okay, I said I'll be there!

144
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,000
Sorry!

145
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,000
I've got to run. Sorry,
couldn't spend time with you.

146
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,375
Well, what can one do? Work is worship.

147
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,500
Five! Just don't forget that.

148
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,250
Fifth of every month. That's the date.

149
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,833
Just don't forget to pay the installment
on time.

150
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,583
Fifth!

151
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,792
<i>I finally feel promoted!</i>

152
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,667
<i>I was tired of sizing up women for bras
and undies.</i>

153
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,667
<i>This feels magical!</i>

154
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,625
<i>Looks like my luck has changed for good.</i>

155
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,625
SONAM'S LEHENGA

156
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,833
Just watch. Every billboard
will have Sonam's lehenga on it.

157
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,583
Just wait and watch how I mint money now.

158
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,542
Now you'll see how my days change
for good.

159
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,500
<i>Brij!</i>

160
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:33,792
Wake up!

161
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,042
- It's you.
- Who did you expect? Have some kheer.

162
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,208
Kheer, at this hour?

163
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,000
Remember the selfie you took of me?
It came first.

164
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:53,208
They'll now charge just 20,000
for the weight loss

165
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:55,333
and 60,000 for the dimples.

166
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,042
I don't have that much money.

167
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm not asking. Just letting you know.

168
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,250
I'll withdraw it from
your savings account tomorrow.

169
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,958
Sweetie, that money is
for emergencies.

170
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:08,458
- You can't blow it on such useless stuff.
- You call it useless!

171
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,250
When you got a gold cap on your tooth,
was that an emergency?

172
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:16,250
You had money for that. You have money
for gold rings, for smartphones,

173
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:20,125
a wheelchair for the old man,
for your stupid gown business,

174
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,292
but when I ask for it,
you turn into a pauper.

175
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,958
I'm not a fuckin' maid!
I'll withdraw the money!

176
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,667
Don't you dare touch that money.

177
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,500
Hey! Don't threaten me. What'll you do?

178
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,083
I'll give you such a tight one,
you wouldn't know what hit you!

179
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,250
It's all my mistake.
I missed him by a day.

180
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:43,167
I should have accepted
Malhotra's wedding proposal.

181
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,458
He is running such a successful business.

182
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:50,125
At least he wouldn't have made me beg
for such a small thing. Bloody cheap!

183
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,417
I'm stuck with a terrible person!
I'm fed up of your constant...

184
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:18,125
What's so funny? I don't know anything.
I need the money!

185
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,667
The rest of it is mine.

186
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,000
This is fine stuff, ma'am.

187
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,667
Just delivered from Mumbai.

188
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,750
Designed by Sonam's personal designer.

189
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,500
Ma'am, today
is Mr. Anil Kapoor's birthday.

190
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,583
So, we are offering a discount
of ten percent.

191
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,208
- Do you have the Mastani gown?
- Mastani gown?

192
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,792
There are billboards all over the place,
and you don't even know about it?

193
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:52,958
Deepika wore it in a movie.
We won't get it here. Let's go.

194
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:54,208
We'll check in the next shop.

195
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:57,000
Ma'am, we have a variety in colors.
Perhaps, something else?

196
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:02,458
Oh, man. It's already a week
and I haven't sold a single piece.

197
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,125
I'm going to get screwed.

198
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:06,708
She was the fourth since this morning
to ask for Mastani.

199
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,333
What the fuck is this?

200
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,125
<i>In Delhi, "motherfucker"
isn't really a cuss word,</i>

201
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,167
<i>it's a thought, it's an emotion.</i>

202
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,083
Just look at that, motherfucker.

203
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:32,792
Fuckin' hot, motherfucker.

204
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,208
DEEPIKA'S LEHENGA

205
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,042
<i>This is lust.</i>

206
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,208
Tomar?

207
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,458
Are these gowns selling?

208
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:51,292
They are flying off the shelves.
People are crazy about it.

209
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:56,417
You should have taken Mastani from Suri.
Why'd you buy that crap?

210
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,083
Motherfucker!

211
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,500
<i>This is shock.</i>

212
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,500
Madan, load everything in the truck!
That motherfucker, Suri, tricked me.

213
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,917
- What do we load?
<i>- This is anger.</i>

214
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,417
Sonam gowns, you asshole!
Quickly pack all the Sonam lehengas.

215
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:20,375
That fucker, Suri, dumped his crap on me.
I am going to fuck him up now.

216
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,500
He has only seen my gentle side.

217
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:25,375
I am going to show him who Gupta
really is. Motherfucker!

218
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,833
I am going to thrash him
like a street dog.

219
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,792
Sir. Sir, don't say that please.
Sir, I'll be fucked.

220
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,083
I'll be on the motherfuckin' streets.

221
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,458
<i>This is... begging.</i>

222
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:43,125
It's our policy. No refund.
So, you better cool down.

223
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,333
Just pray to the Goddess.

224
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,875
Sooner or later, she will help you
sell everything.

225
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,458
Sir, please! Please at least exchange it
for Mastani.

226
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,208
I've got to pay Raghu
the first instalment on Monday.

227
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,792
Sir, you can't fuck me like this.

228
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,250
What did you say, you fucker?

229
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,083
You gave me outdated stuff.
You cheated me.

230
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,958
Your Goddess can do jack shit for this.

231
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:21,583
You asshole. How dare you insult
the Goddess in my shop!

232
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,792
You fuckin' come anywhere near me,
I'll fuckin' break your bones.

233
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,458
Motherfucker!

234
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,417
<i>This is... well, this is just plain
good ol' cussing!</i>

235
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,292
- Sweetty...
- Yes?

236
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,833
...where is all the stuff?

237
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,583
I sold everything. It fetched 32,000.

238
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,625
What? You... You sold...

239
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,333
Are you fuckin' crazy?
You emptied the entire house?

240
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,750
Don't yell like a banshee.

241
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,958
Most of the stuff
was from my dowry anyway.

242
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,167
You should be thanking me.
I've made your life easier.

243
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:19,292
Now you won't have to pay
for the Weightover program.

244
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,708
- You just have to pay 60,000 for the...
- Where is Grandpa?

245
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,458
What? He is right here.

246
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,458
Well, that cupboard...

247
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:40,125
Yes, tell me quickly. Yes, yes.
I know that place.

248
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:44,083
I hope all the stuff is there.

249
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,833
Sir, what is so important that you
couldn't wait till morning?

250
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,875
I'll tell all that later.
First open the truck.

251
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,667
The night is ruined.

252
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:58,583
Here, have a look.

253
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,083
I'm telling you,
there is nothing in there.

254
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:09,333
You keep quiet.

255
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,292
Oh, no.

256
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,125
Oh, shit! What the fuck!

257
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,417
<i>What's the big problem?
It's not as if he died or anything.</i>

258
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,958
You told me not to cover
him with the blanket!

259
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,792
So, I put him in the cupboard this time.

260
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,333
I even kept a water bottle inside.
I've got a heart too, y'know.

261
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,208
If only you had given me the money,
I wouldn't have had to sell all this.

262
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:34,000
If you are so fed up with me,
why don't you just leave me?

263
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,750
Leave you?

264
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:42,625
I'll leave this house in a coffin.

265
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,333
I know what you men want.

266
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,625
Hope you are not busy?

267
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,417
See, Raghu calling.

268
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,708
C'mon, take the call.

269
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:39,833
- Speak!
- Hello.

270
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:44,542
Wow! Good to hear your voice.
What did I say?

271
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,833
Installments... Installments.

272
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:49,583
The installments should be paid
on time.

273
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,625
And what if you don't pay on time?

274
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,625
Then I'll have to return the whole amount
in one go.

275
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,125
Nice!

276
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:03,875
Next Monday... I need
the whole 2.5 million. Clear?

277
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,458
Or you'll have
a very nasty Tuesday.

278
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,292
- Are we clear?
- Yes.

279
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,000
Good! Hang up now.
Don't raise my fuckin' bill.

280
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,292
Cust... Cust... Must be customers.

281
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,500
Customer. Hey! Open the door!

282
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,500
Go on! Get the door.

283
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,958
If he doesn't earn,
how'll he repay the loan?

284
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,667
Can you show us little lacys?

285
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,083
A white netted one for me
and a plain one for her.

286
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:42,792
Madan! Take out a 32B and a 34D.

287
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,667
Let me help you.

288
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,917
I'll fetch it, Brij, sir.
Please tell me where it is kept.

289
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,833
There you go. B for you...

290
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,125
and D for you.

291
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:06,375
Thank you.

292
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,250
You are a killer, dude!

293
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:14,750
Just one look and you sized them up.

294
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,000
Wonderful! Man, you are a true artist!

295
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,375
Nice! Nice.

296
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,000
Y'know what? Take an additional day.
From my side. Okay?

297
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,000
So, Tuesday then?

298
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,458
Right?

299
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,000
Keep the money.

300
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,750
It's your hard-earned income. Keep it.

301
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:44,417
Pick up the phone on time, fucker!

302
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,375
Hang on...

303
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,333
- What's wrong?
- Sorry.

304
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,625
- Please wait.
- You just can't do it.

305
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,083
- Don't leave. Simmi, please wait.
- Get off me.

306
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:15,083
- Simmi, please wait. Simmi, sorry.
- What's wrong with you today?

307
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:19,667
- Simmi, let's try once more, please!
- We have already tried three times.

308
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,250
It's so hot inside the car.

309
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,458
This trash of yours
doesn't even have AC.

310
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,292
Simmi, one minute.

311
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:30,167
Simmi.

312
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:35,792
Sorry, Simmi.

313
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,125
Hand me the iPhone.

314
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,292
My life is totally screwed up right now.
Suri's got me trapped.

315
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:53,625
I have Raghu's loan on my head.
I'm just stressed. Just can't get it up.

316
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:57,417
Look here.

317
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:01,083
How do I look?

318
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:03,208
It would've been better
if we'd met earlier.

319
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:10,208
Earlier, when? Ten years back?
When I was 14?

320
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,000
Simmi!

321
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,917
I am sick of meeting secretly.

322
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:24,458
Why don't we run away?

323
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:29,833
Will you come with me?

324
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:36,417
- Will you take me with you?
- I'll take you wherever you want to go.

325
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:43,417
How about Bangkok? We'll get massages.
I'll go crazy shopping.

326
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:47,125
I love you.

327
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:48,833
What? What did you say?

328
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,000
I love you.

329
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:04,708
<i>I used to be a fat man before.
People laughed at me.</i>

330
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:06,292
I need two or three packs,

331
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:10,458
and a dimple on my left cheek.
Just like that movie star,

332
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,042
she has one on her right cheek...

333
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,875
So pleased by your presence.

334
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,333
Give him the check.

335
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:22,250
<i>But this program
has helped me tremendously.</i>

336
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:26,125
- This one.
<i>- I'm a changed man now.</i>

337
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:29,042
- Note it.
<i>- My friends acknowledge me now.</i>

338
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:33,917
<i>My life has turned around.
It's as if I'm a new person.</i>

339
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:39,542
<i>I'm in love with myself.
I'm so much more confident now.</i>

340
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:42,500
<i>I'm confident enough to have
a conversation now.</i>

341
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,500
<i>Even conversations with women.</i>

342
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:47,708
Excuse me. Hang on,
these two are two different men.

343
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:55,583
You've pasted the same face on the bodies
of these two men.

344
00:25:56,167 --> 00:26:00,083
Not at all, sir. You're mistaken.
They are the same person.

345
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:03,125
That's what we do here, transform.

346
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,083
<i>Yes, I don’t have any worries now.</i>

347
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:10,375
<i>As cited in the </i>Bhagavad Gita<i>,
like we wear different clothes every day,</i>

348
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:15,167
<i>similarly, souls leave one body
and take refuge in another, for rebirth.</i>

349
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:20,083
<i>Who am I to question the word of God?
It's mentioned in the </i>Gita <i>after all.</i>

350
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,083
Amar.

351
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:28,167
Amar Sethi.

352
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,042
Hello... I'm Amar Sethi.

353
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:37,667
Namaste. Myself, Amar Sethi.

354
00:26:41,042 --> 00:26:43,333
Amar Sethi. Myself, Amar Sethi.

355
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:46,250
Amar. Amar Sethi.

356
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,958
<i>Now, my spirit can't live in two
separate bodies, can it?</i>

357
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:53,917
<i>So, for Amar Sethi to be born,
Brij Mohan must die.</i>

358
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,292
- Why do you need a dead body?
- What?

359
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,250
Oh... I... I work in a medical college.
Students there need it.

360
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:13,000
I have a female body.
It'll cost you 10,000.

361
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:17,000
She was found at the Haryana border.
There's a steady supply from there.

362
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:21,042
No. No, please. A female won't do.
We need a man. Someone my size?

363
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:23,542
It's for research, y'know.

364
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,750
<i>According to Google, every person has six
look-alikes in this world.</i>

365
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,250
<i>I can't even find fuckin' one of mine.</i>

366
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:53,917
Are you blind? Motherfucker!

367
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:03,958
- Sorry.
- Gupta... I am back!

368
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,417
Gotcha!

369
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:14,750
Show me the money.

370
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,917
Sir, today is Monday.

371
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:22,292
Dude, I couldn't control it.
Tell me, where is my money?

372
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,000
Sir, I am having it arranged.

373
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,667
I will get you the money by tomorrow
for sure.

374
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:28,875
You're having it arranged?

375
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:40,458
Are they fucking tomatoes?
Will you pick them up from a mart?

376
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,917
Sir, I will definitely give you the money
tomorrow. Promise.

377
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,750
Will you? Certainly?

378
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,250
Sir, the door's jammed. It won't open.

379
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,458
- You think I am a fucking idiot.
- No...

380
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:04,583
If you don't have it on Monday, will God
himself fucking gift you it tomorrow!

381
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,208
Sir, I have promised.
By tomorrow morning...

382
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:16,875
Right now,
I have shoved this in your mouth.

383
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,542
If you don't pay by tonight,
I will shoot it through your ass.

384
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:26,125
Speed it up. Speed it up, you fucker!

385
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:32,250
<i>I think our ass is the weakest part
of our body.</i>

386
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:35,625
<i>Whenever there is a screw up,
your ass is the first thing to get kicked.</i>

387
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,833
<i>It gets busted, screwed, ripped
and fried as well.</i>

388
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:42,000
<i>Have you ever heard...</i>

389
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,250
<i>I will burn your ears...</i>

390
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:49,167
<i>I will screw your nose?</i>

391
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,958
<i>My luck is totally fucked right now.</i>

392
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:58,625
<i>I wasted a lot of time on that stupid plan
to change my identity to Amar Sethi.</i>

393
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,750
<i>These things only happen
in story books.</i>

394
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:04,958
<i>In real life, if I don't pay Raghu by
tonight, he will surely screw up my ass.</i>

395
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:38,417
Okay. Listen, Karta, got a client here.

396
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:44,750
Wow, Gupta. What a surprise!
You have made me a happy man!

397
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,458
Seems like you know how to keep
your word.

398
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
- Sir, actually...
- Come on in!

399
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:51,958
Come on in!

400
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:04,167
Come on in, Gupta. We mustn't let
easy money slip away from our palms.

401
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:09,833
Watch your step here.

402
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,417
Pull up a chair.

403
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:25,792
Here we go.

404
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,083
What the fuck!

405
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,417
Sir, I could only manage 700,000
after selling the gowns.

406
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,792
I will pay up everything. Please.
I am not running away anywhere.

407
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:50,000
- You think this is some kind of a joke!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

408
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:54,500
- You think I am an idiot!
- Sir, please don't hit me.

409
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,167
You think I am an idiot!

410
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:04,875
Sir, please don't hit me.
Hitting me won't get you the money!

411
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,500
Let's... Let's sit and talk peacefully.

412
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:09,250
Now you will teach me how to get
my money!

413
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,458
You think you are that smart.
I am not worried about the money.

414
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,708
I will sell your house and your shop
and get my...

415
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,000
Sir!

416
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,417
Sir?

417
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:27,667
Sorry. Sorry, sir.

418
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,917
Sir, please get up.

419
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,333
Is anybody there?

420
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,667
Please get up, for heaven's sake.

421
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:02,875
No, no. No. This did not happen!

422
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:07,333
My goodness. It happened.
It actually happened!

423
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:11,917
It's not a dream. It's not a dream!

424
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,333
- Sir.
- What the fuck!

425
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:23,375
Motherfucker, did you put gas on me?
You're trying to light me up?

426
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,958
Sorry, sir, it happened by mistake.
The gas fell on you!

427
00:38:58,375 --> 00:38:59,417
Brij.

428
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:02,708
Brij!

429
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:05,542
Brij!

430
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:11,083
Simmi, it's me, Brij!

431
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:13,250
What have you done to yourself?

432
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:15,417
You look like a fucking alien.

433
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:21,875
- I got scared, you know.
- Not an alien, Amar Sethi.

434
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,750
From now on, I am Amar Sethi.

435
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,167
Now you just wait, we will

436
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:30,792
go to Bangkok, Malaysia and trot
the whole wide world together!

437
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,375
I want to buy the stars and moon for you!

438
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,750
<i>It's a new beginning from now on.
Small family, always a happy family.</i>

439
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:46,625
Wait, where is my chewing gum, Brij?

440
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,500
And it's not Brij anymore.
It's Amar Sethi.

441
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:59,000
Then, where the hell has Brij gone?

442
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,833
I don't know where the hell he is.

443
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:04,958
He has been gone
for the past four days. What do I do?

444
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:07,833
Sir, she is blatantly lying.
She was the one who gave me

445
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,292
the check at the Weightover office.

446
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,750
Now the check has bounced
so she is blaming it on her husband.

447
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:13,000
Shut the fuck up.

448
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:15,667
Your husband's been missing for four days.

449
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,708
- Yes.
- Why haven't you reported it yet?

450
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:24,125
Sir, I don't know how to handle it.
Every now and then he goes missing.

451
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,833
He tells me that he is going to get stock
for his shop.

452
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,417
Then I have to take care
of his old crippled grandfather.

453
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
He is a complete invalid.

454
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,292
How can a poor woman like me handle
all these things alone?

455
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:37,083
Now the check has also bounced.
I don't know what to do.

456
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:40,083
- Sir, please report the matter...
- Stop fucking boiling your blood.

457
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:42,875
A report will be filed against the guy
who wrote the check.

458
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:44,958
Get me that guy first then I will report
the matter.

459
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,083
- But, sir...
- I will tear you apart if you say anything

460
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:48,042
Get lost!

461
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:52,458
Very thanks, sir.

462
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,833
- Send her in.
- Okay.

463
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:57,542
Ma'am, please go in. Yes.
Sir has called you in.

464
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,792
Ask him yourself. Please go in.

465
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:06,292
Do you have a photograph
or a contact number for your husband?

466
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:07,750
Yes, here.

467
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,875
People always try to take advantage
of wives in the absence of their husbands.

468
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:25,125
Do you miss your husband?

469
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:35,167
I have always been alone.
He was hardly at home.

470
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,208
Now he has left me to flounder.

471
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,583
Please don't cry. Here, please.

472
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,125
Old Spice! I love Old Spice.

473
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,500
Did your husband wear it?

474
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,250
No. He never cared for such things.

475
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:02,292
Collecting perfumes is my hobby.

476
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:07,708
It's a good hobby.

477
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,333
Anyone who thinks of leaving you
should get their eyes checked.

478
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,542
Brij's contact details.

479
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:32,292
You can keep it.
You like Old Spice, don't you?

480
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:37,125
Not just on handkerchiefs.

481
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:52,250
Sir, it's fully roasted.

482
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:01,250
- Looks like a woman to me.
- True that.

483
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:10,500
- Handle the remains properly.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:16,792
Sir, I am dying to hear the good news.

485
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:21,625
Okay, sir. I'll be there in the evening.

486
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:32,542
<i>Dude, I cannot get your transfer done now.</i>

487
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:37,417
They are asking for three million.

488
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:41,375
Didn't we agree on two?
An extra million for what?

489
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,167
You have a pathetic record.

490
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,833
You have just four solved cases
to your name in the past two years.

491
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,333
I took care of that as well.

492
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,583
But you've got to keep your shit together.

493
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,708
I hear a criminal named Surjeet escaped
from your custody.

494
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:00,375
What! When did that happen?

495
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:03,917
Wow! A guy escapes
from right under your nose,

496
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:05,750
and you have no clue.

497
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:14,000
Bastard! You helped Surjeet escape!

498
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:17,208
Sir, you said the seniors were breathing
down your neck to meet the weekly target.

499
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:19,750
So, I let him off. That 25,000
which I gave you was from him.

500
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:22,458
What? That 25 was from Surjeet?
You get down!

501
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:24,375
Sorry. Forgive me, sir.

502
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:29,083
- I won't let you off so easily.
- Sorry, sir! Why are you hitting me?

503
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,500
Because of you, I will have to shell out
a million more!

504
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:34,042
- Your pop in law will pay for it?
- Sir, please.

505
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:39,000
Don't even think of coming out.

506
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:45,458
- What are you looking for?
- A man is dead and nobody gives a fuck.

507
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:50,750
Let me go and check some more newspapers
at the reception.

508
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:52,750
Ask someone to collect the laundry
from here.

509
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:58,000
Who's dead now?

510
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:14,542
Simmi?

511
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:20,125
- Simmi?
- The cuckoo flew away?

512
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:27,125
Don't worry, she hasn't flown away
till now. But she will fly away soon.

513
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:32,542
Hurry up, lover boy.
She is in the other room.

514
00:45:33,292 --> 00:45:34,833
Right now, she has just started.

515
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:38,667
- If you're late, she'll get laid.
- Move!

516
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:47,167
Twenty-one, 22, 23, 24...

517
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:50,542
Brij, just look at his body!
He is just unstoppable!

518
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:54,917
- ...25.
- Simmi, let's go to the room.

519
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,750
Only five more left.
Come on, let's do it.

520
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,667
- ...26...
- Let's go!

521
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:08,042
How many times have I told you,
I am Amar Sethi, not Brij.

522
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:11,083
It's not funny, Simmi!

523
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:15,625
- Listen to me.
- You listen to me!

524
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:19,625
I am so done with this hotel!
There is no entertainment at all!

525
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,083
There is such a big sale going
on in Big Bazaar.

526
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:25,458
All my friends have gone shopping there.
They kept calling me. I can't call anyone.

527
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:29,000
You don't even let me call anybody!
I am a fucking prisoner here!

528
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,042
I am so sorry, Simmi.

529
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,083
It's just a matter of couple of days.
We will be in Bangkok in no time.

530
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,583
There is no cable TV here. No shows.
I haven't seen <i>Big Boss </i>for so long.

531
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:54,333
There is no bloody Wi-Fi as well,
I get so bored here.

532
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,833
And we haven't even had sex for so long.

533
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:02,333
Whenever I see your face,
I feel like I am fucking an alien.

534
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,417
It's just ridiculous.

535
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:07,833
I have an idea!

536
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,500
- How do I look?
- Smoking hot.

537
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:27,042
I think it's a great idea.
We will make loads of masks.

538
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,875
Sometimes Tom Cruise,
sometimes Shah Rukh Khan.

539
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,167
What happened?

540
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:45,125
Now you look scarier than an alien.

541
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,750
What's the hurry? Oh, it's you.

542
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:52,542
You could have called.

543
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:55,417
You took me by surprise!
At least I would have been presentable.

544
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:59,750
Please don't take them off.
You look so dashing.

545
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,292
I can smell Old Spice from here.

546
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:09,583
I just love it. It's my favorite perfume!

547
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:14,125
- Can you come with me?
- Anytime.

548
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:15,833
Not like that.

549
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,000
This...

550
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,792
We have found a burnt car...
and a dead body in it.

551
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,667
What? What is this?

552
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,417
What's this, Simmi?

553
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:15,292
I have been telling you that I need
to go shopping.

554
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,083
But you don't care.

555
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,750
Now you'll know what it feels like
to not have any fresh clothes to wear.

556
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,542
Are you fucking out of your mind?

557
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,042
What do you mean by,
"You don't have clothes"?

558
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:30,000
You have got these two huge bags
full of clothes!

559
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:32,542
All the clothes are dirty.

560
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:35,792
And you promised me that you will buy
new ones for me.

561
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,375
That we will go to Bangkok.

562
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:41,000
Is this shit hole your Bangkok?

563
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,875
I am so fucking fed up of staying
in this hotel.

564
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,833
I can't go out, I can't call anybody.
I can't even sleep with you.

565
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:51,500
Nor will you let me sleep
with someone else.

566
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:57,875
What? You want to sleep with someone else?

567
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:02,250
Did you come here to have sex?

568
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:07,625
- I am talking to you!
- I am only 24! I want to have sex!

569
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,833
I really, really, really want to have sex.
I love sex!

570
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:29,875
Simmi, please don't cry.

571
00:52:30,292 --> 00:52:34,417
It didn't hurt, I am not even upset.

572
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:40,167
I am not crying because of that.
I have spoiled my nails.

573
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
It took me eons to paint my nails.

574
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:48,500
- Don't worry, I will paint them for you.
- You won't be able to do it.

575
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:51,583
Let me try at least.

576
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,417
- It is all ruined
- See, I am painting it right.

577
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,458
The death certificate is ready.

578
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:44,542
<i>Now the financial growth news in detail.</i>

579
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:48,250
<i>India can surpass China this year.
It is an estimation by the...</i>

580
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:40,042
Do you only undress when you're off-duty?

581
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,375
THREE EX-MINISTERS
OUT IN THE FIRST POLL LIST.

582
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:58,083
JWALA HEDI HOSIERY OWNER
DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT

583
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,125
He is so shy!

584
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:29,417
- Where are you off to?
- I am going to do laundry.

585
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:33,250
Get rid of these dirty clothes.
I will buy you new ones now!

586
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:36,417
Just look here.
The news is out that I am dead.

587
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,042
How can you be dead?
I don't get it.

588
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,667
- I will explain. Let's go to the room.
- Let go and drop my clothes.

589
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,500
- Drop those later.
- I will be back in no time.

590
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,417
I will keep one million out of the 2.5.

591
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:09,083
No, 400,000.

592
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:17,792
Were you running away with the money?

593
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:24,750
I did all this for you
and you were leaving me for the money.

594
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:26,958
What the fuck should I do then?
Get married to you?

595
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:30,250
- You look like shit!
- Leave it! Leave it, I said!

596
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:38,583
- Is money the only thing you want?
- Yes. I want the money. Let go of my hand.

597
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:42,042
- You came with me only because of money?
- Get the fuck away from me!

598
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:45,000
- Don't you raise your voice to me!
- I will! I am not fucking scared of you!

599
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:49,458
<i>Simmi! Simmi!</i>

600
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,542
- Eight hundred thousand.
- Six hundred thousand.

601
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:05,083
Simmi, what's happening inside?

602
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:07,750
<i>Simmi, what's happening inside?</i>

603
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,083
<i>Simmi! Simmi, open the door!</i>

604
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:17,250
Simmi, what's happening inside?
Simmi! Simmi, open the door!

605
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:23,333
<i>Simmi, open the door! Simmi, are you okay?</i>

606
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:36,208
Simmi! Simmi! Simmi!

607
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:39,917
<i>Simmi, what's happening inside?
Simmi, open the door!</i>

608
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:44,375
Simmi!

609
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:45,958
<i>Simmi, open the door!</i>

610
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:48,500
<i>Simmi, are you okay?</i>

611
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:53,542
<i>Simmi, open the door! Simmi!</i>

612
00:57:57,083 --> 00:58:00,042
Simmi, what's happening inside? Simmi!

613
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:04,125
Simmi open the door! Simmi!

614
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:06,083
What's the hurry?
Why are you creating a ruckus?

615
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:08,000
Oh, sorry, I thought...

616
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:18,042
- Are you checking out today?
- No. I have to drop this somewhere.

617
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:20,792
I have already paid an advance
till Sunday.

618
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:43,208
Sir, please enter the address in the app.

619
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:47,167
The GPS will track the location
on its own.

620
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:50,792
We have been looking in the dark
for more than half an hour now.

621
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,958
Please, pull over here.

622
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:42,458
Dude, a stolen mobile has been traced.
We've got to look for it.

623
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:48,750
It's a fucked-up place, man.
Nothing big ever gets stolen here.

624
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:29,833
Where's your cuckoo?

625
01:02:32,042 --> 01:02:33,083
Gone?

626
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:37,458
- Are you free now?
- Nothing's free, honey.

627
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:40,500
- You've got to pay.
- Yeah, I know.

628
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,250
Nobody even gives a shit for free here.
Let's go.

629
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:13,750
Amar Sethi?

630
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,833
Where did you buy this mobile?

631
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:27,083
Wait! Get him! Don't let him go!

632
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:32,583
Get him. Get him!

633
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:37,375
What happened?
I bought it from the second's market.

634
01:03:37,542 --> 01:03:40,333
Why the fuck were you running away then?
You think we are fucking idiots?

635
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,417
<i>So the insurance guys won't bother me
anymore?</i>

636
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,375
No, they won't.

637
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:49,292
Had they known that the car didn't burn
in an accident...

638
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:51,208
they wouldn't have paid a penny.

639
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,167
Can't we go home now?

640
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:02,417
I will swing by in the night to get
my share.

641
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:05,208
I've also got to pick up part
of the insurance money.

642
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:09,333
Yeah.

643
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:11,375
<i>Sir, we have nabbed someone by the name
Amar Sethi</i>

644
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,250
<i>in possession of Brij Mohan's phone.</i>

645
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:15,333
<i>He has got 600,000 to 700,000
in cash on him as well.</i>

646
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,750
- Don't let him go.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

647
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:18,250
- And listen.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

648
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:21,375
- Keep the cash off the records.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

649
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,917
Did you shave your hair off as a ritual?

650
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:35,083
- Did someone die in your family?
- No. I have a hair disorder.

651
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:36,042
Disorder?

652
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,792
Name?

653
01:04:58,333 --> 01:05:00,750
Amar Sethi.

654
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:05,750
Sir, I didn't steal the phone.

655
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,333
- Sir, please, please!
- Don't move! Be seated.

656
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:32,125
- Soma!
- Yes, sir!

657
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,542
- Have you filed the report?
- Yes, sir!

658
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:35,667
Lock him up.

659
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:38,000
Sir, but why are you putting me
in the lock up?

660
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:41,958
- I haven't stolen anything!
- Come on, move it! Move it. Get in.

661
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:46,375
- I haven't stolen anything!
- Come on, move it! Move it. Get in.

662
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:07,500
Dude, move away!

663
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:15,958
Bro, you are a petty mobile thief.
Bunty is the king of kidnapping.

664
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:19,667
He is way up in the line.
You better not get in his way.

665
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:45,708
- What about the rest?
- Search me.

666
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,917
Here's your six pack.

667
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:01,792
Nice.

668
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:04,542
Tell me something.

669
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:10,333
What if Brij Mohan is alive and not dead.

670
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:13,125
What would you do then?

671
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:17,958
I will snuff out his life
with my bare hands.

672
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,208
Did you get your hand stamped?

673
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:41,042
Stamp?

674
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:44,000
You only get food here
when you get stamped.

675
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:46,333
No, I haven't got stamped.

676
01:07:53,042 --> 01:07:54,125
Somebody please help me!

677
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:57,500
Your internet sucks!

678
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:02,958
The connection was down the whole night.
Now the torrent is also not working.

679
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:05,792
If its been shut down,
then who the fuck is going to start it?

680
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:09,958
- What am I paying you for?
- Why are you taking my blood?

681
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:13,583
Who is the doctor here? You or me?
"Why are you taking my blood?"

682
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:15,792
Let's go.

683
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:20,333
Sir, please believe me.
I didn't steal the mobile.

684
01:08:21,292 --> 01:08:23,458
I've been slogging my ass off here
for the past 15 years.

685
01:08:23,542 --> 01:08:24,417
But, sir...

686
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,708
What the fuck do you think
I'm talking here!

687
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:31,458
Our law is totally fucked up.

688
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:34,167
If you confess to stealing the mobile

689
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,125
then you will be a free man
in a couple of days.

690
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:39,375
But if you don't, then you will rot
in the prison while your trial is on.

691
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,125
Eat.

692
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:57,083
They fuck asses in prison. Literally.

693
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:00,792
And you look like a blooming virgin
from all sides.

694
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:04,083
Agree to committing this theft.
You have a hearing tomorrow.

695
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:07,875
If you get stuck
with those black coat vampires...

696
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:11,833
they will suck every drop of your blood
till you drop dead.

697
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:14,292
Got it?

698
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:19,667
You have all night, think about it.
Eat something.

699
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:40,208
Sir, your brother-in-law is the judge,
please help me get out of this mess.

700
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:45,875
I can easily arrange for around
two million. Whenever, you let me know.

701
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:48,625
Sir, I am Amar Sethi.

702
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:52,125
I have been charged with mobile theft.
Will I be acquitted on all accounts?

703
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:55,042
It's a petty crime.
Don't bloody disturb me.

704
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:57,417
Go and stand in the line.

705
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:03,458
- Bunty, did you say two million?
- Yes, sir.

706
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,625
Hope you guys are fine.
Did the police beat you up?

707
01:10:23,917 --> 01:10:26,417
What happened to your face?
Did the police do this to you?

708
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,917
No, sir. This is an old wound.

709
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:34,167
But this...
This happened while in police custody.

710
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:38,875
Sir, he tried to commit suicide.
I had to restrain him.

711
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:41,833
It's a lie! I didn't do anything.
You can ask the police officer.

712
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,250
What's your name?

713
01:10:45,792 --> 01:10:46,875
Amar Sethi.

714
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,292
What is his case about?

715
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,417
Sir, he is Amar Sethi,

716
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:01,208
and he has been caught by the police
for stealing Brij Mohan Gupta's iPhone.

717
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:07,500
- This iPhone was found in his possession.
- Did you steal the phone?

718
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:14,708
Yes, sir. I stole it by mistake.

719
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,458
This is my first crime ever.

720
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:22,417
Please pardon this mistake of mine.

721
01:11:24,292 --> 01:11:25,458
Prosecution.

722
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:29,708
Sir, during the police investigation...

723
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:32,792
This is his blood report,
it matches with the handkerchief.

724
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:38,083
Okay. Sir, during
the brilliant police investigation

725
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:39,333
certain evidence was found.

726
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,708
A hanky was found with blood stains on it.

727
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:47,417
But the blood is not of Brij Mohan,
but it is Amar Sethi's.

728
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:52,167
The police strongly feels
that not only did Amar Sethi

729
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:55,708
steal Brij Mohan's phone,
but also murdered Brij Mohan Gupta.

730
01:11:57,375 --> 01:12:00,917
The police wants to take Amar Sethi
in remand for five days.

731
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,667
Sir, what is he talking about?
It's totally absurd.

732
01:12:03,917 --> 01:12:05,792
I did not even steal the phone.

733
01:12:06,292 --> 01:12:07,500
What?

734
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:11,083
Didn't you confess
that you stole the mobile?

735
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:14,208
I didn't steal it. The inspector
asked me to confess so I did.

736
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:16,042
I didn't kill Brij Mohan.

737
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,958
If the inspector asks you to jump
off a building, would you jump?

738
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,583
Please strike out whatever the accused
has said.

739
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:37,417
I am approving a five-day remand...
with strict directions to the police

740
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,417
that a constable remain with the accused
at all times.

741
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,167
Sir, I haven't murdered anyone.

742
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:47,208
Please believe me.
I didn't kill Brij Mohan.

743
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:48,917
Did you speak to your brother in law?

744
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,042
Dude, wait! I have been charged
with murder, man!

745
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:52,958
Sir, I haven't committed any murder.

746
01:12:53,042 --> 01:12:54,500
- Let's go!
- Please, just two minutes.

747
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:57,250
I am being framed.
I only confessed to theft.

748
01:12:57,333 --> 01:13:00,375
- I don't know anything about the murder!
- Don't you worry, we will sort it out.

749
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:02,167
Sir, please!

750
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:07,625
Sir, you said I would be sentenced
for two, three days.

751
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:08,958
But this will screw up my life.

752
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:13,000
- Take him away.
- Come on, move!

753
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:16,542
Sir, I haven't killed anyone.
I am innocent!

754
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:17,667
Move.

755
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:22,917
Yes, sir?

756
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:29,208
Two million for the authorities
and about 500,000.

757
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,083
for miscellaneous expenses.

758
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:34,167
Around about 2.5 million
will be needed to get you out.

759
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:36,333
- I'll have it arranged, sir.
- Go.

760
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:43,833
Why did you bring him here?

761
01:13:44,417 --> 01:13:47,083
You wanted the chair. He was tied
to the chair, so I brought him here.

762
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:48,958
Sir, I haven't killed anyone!

763
01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:51,042
Will you stop crying in a fucking loop?

764
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,083
Tie him up to a stool.

765
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:55,208
That's not available.
The commode in the loo

766
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:57,333
is broken, so, I have replaced it
with the stool.

767
01:13:57,583 --> 01:14:01,792
Sir, why are you doing this to me?
You know I haven't killed anyone.

768
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:09,000
Move your ass. Move!

769
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:24,333
Prosecution. What is the motive
behind the murder?

770
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:28,625
Motive?

771
01:14:31,417 --> 01:14:35,333
Motive... could be anything.

772
01:14:37,042 --> 01:14:38,708
This mobile could be motive!

773
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:40,958
Sir, this phone is 60,000.

774
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:44,708
In the last case, that Khanna
was murdered for a bicycle.

775
01:14:45,042 --> 01:14:48,333
That bicycle was 6,500. A man
was murdered for that amount.

776
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:51,500
So 60,000 is a huge amount compared
to that.

777
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:53,958
Any objection?

778
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:58,292
- No, sir.
- What? Why not?

779
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,167
This is so ridiculous. Completely absurd.

780
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:03,042
First of all, I bought this phone
and didn't steal it.

781
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:06,375
And secondly, why would someone kill
for a phone?

782
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,833
I didn't kill Brij Mohan. I swear.

783
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,417
We know you killed him.
There's been a thorough investigation.

784
01:15:11,542 --> 01:15:14,000
It's a rubbish investigation.
It's completely baseless.

785
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:18,167
- I can't kill Brij Mohan.
- Why can't you kill him?

786
01:15:20,292 --> 01:15:22,292
I am telling you, I just can't.

787
01:15:22,917 --> 01:15:27,708
Wow! Just because you say so,
we all should believe you.

788
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:30,167
All the evidence says
you are the murderer.

789
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,292
I know, you killed him.

790
01:15:31,417 --> 01:15:34,208
It's not possible for me to kill
Brij Mohan.

791
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:36,167
- I'm telling you that you did.
- No, I didn't!

792
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,208
Give me a reason,
why you couldn't of murdered him?

793
01:15:38,292 --> 01:15:39,417
I mean, how can I...

794
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:42,583
- How can I kill him when I am Brij Mohan!
- What?

795
01:15:57,792 --> 01:16:03,542
I... I am Brij Mohan Gupta.
How can I be my own murderer?

796
01:16:05,792 --> 01:16:09,083
Now, a new story.

797
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:14,833
Sir, I am telling you the truth.
I am Brij Mohan. I am being framed.

798
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:19,458
Okay, even if we believe that you
are Brij.

799
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:21,833
Then whose body was it in the car?

800
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:25,000
Tell me.

801
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,417
How do I know whose body it was?

802
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:35,125
I think you should come out
with the truth now.

803
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,792
You come up
with a new story every time.

804
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:43,625
Earlier you claimed this phone
to be yours, then you denied it.

805
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:48,292
Sometimes you say you are Amar.
Now you are saying you are Brij.

806
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:54,917
Please tell me what the truth is.
I am telling you, truth is power.

807
01:16:55,875 --> 01:17:00,292
If you are Brij Mohan, then whose body
was it in the car?

808
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:06,583
- He doesn't have any answer.
- Raghu's body.

809
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:10,958
Whose?

810
01:17:14,417 --> 01:17:17,500
It was Raghu.

811
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:24,625
But... I didn't kill him.

812
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:28,208
I had taken a loan from him

813
01:17:28,292 --> 01:17:33,542
and I wasn't able to pay him on time.
So he became violent with me.

814
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:36,375
I pushed him to save myself.
But he slipped and fell down the stairs.

815
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:40,958
By the time I reached him, he was dead
already. I only burned his body.

816
01:17:41,042 --> 01:17:42,708
I didn't kill him.

817
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:49,500
If his people ever found out
that he died because of me,

818
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:53,375
they would never leave me
and my poor family alone.

819
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:56,917
I just lied. I didn't have an option.
I didn't kill anyone.

820
01:17:57,417 --> 01:17:59,042
I didn't kill anyone.

821
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:06,625
Why were you playing us
when you knew very well

822
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,292
Amar and Brij were the same person?

823
01:18:08,875 --> 01:18:11,417
When Bunty walks out free
you will win the case.

824
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:14,875
People will think the police are useless.
It always gets the wrong man.

825
01:18:15,167 --> 01:18:17,667
The police
will not take the fall every time.

826
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:20,042
I have worked my ass off on this case.

827
01:18:21,792 --> 01:18:23,000
Amar is the murderer.

828
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,375
I don't give a fuck if he claims
to be Brij or Amar.

829
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:27,958
We are done.

830
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:36,833
Come on. Get a hold of yourself, guys.

831
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:40,917
Just get some witnesses
and do away with this case.

832
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:46,542
What does it matter if he is Amar or Brij.
Truth, my ass!

833
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:50,875
Whatever I crap out will be the truth.

834
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,083
Let me know if Bunty has paid.
I will wrap up his case.

835
01:18:55,667 --> 01:19:01,375
I don't want any blot of pending cases
on my name when I retire.

836
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:04,083
Also, do you know someone
who teaches English?

837
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:07,125
- For your son, Bablu?
- Are you nuts?

838
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:10,292
This stenographer's English is trash.

839
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:13,750
The first criteria for a landmark judgment
is good English.

840
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:18,167
Whenever one searches
for a landmark judgment on Google,

841
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:20,167
my judgment should pop up at the top.

842
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:24,375
So keep your eyes open if you find one
with good English.

843
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,417
Asshole, you killed Raghu!

844
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:39,833
Where the fuck is the money?
Spit it out or I will slice you up!

845
01:19:39,917 --> 01:19:42,958
I have no clue what you are talking about.
What money?

846
01:19:43,042 --> 01:19:44,833
I know how to make douchebags
like you sing!

847
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:51,042
I don't have any money! Believe me!

848
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,292
Get his ass in line!

849
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,792
What are you guys doing? Please don't!
Please, no!

850
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:10,792
I have stitched the cut on your face.

851
01:20:11,792 --> 01:20:15,292
Can't stitch the one down there.
You will have to bear the pain.

852
01:20:19,542 --> 01:20:21,917
Why do you shave your head every day?
Hair looks good on you.

853
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:27,292
Do as you are told, you ass!
Don't give your sermons here.

854
01:20:27,917 --> 01:20:30,875
<i>Gandhi's experiment with truth,
won us freedom...</i>

855
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:35,250
<i>and mine, screwed me.</i>

856
01:20:43,417 --> 01:20:45,875
No chance. He is not Brij for sure.

857
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:48,917
Brij was a Rockstar.

858
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:52,542
This one looks like a scumbag.

859
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:58,625
- Objection?
- No objection.

860
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:03,125
Suri, sir. What are you saying?

861
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:07,208
I am the same one! Remember,
Sonam, gowns, designer babies!

862
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:08,167
Brij...

863
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:12,792
A... Amar. You can't interrupt a session.

864
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:18,083
- Next witness.
- I am very sure he is Amar Sethi.

865
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:22,875
He was staying in my lodge with a girl
called Simmi for 15, 20 days.

866
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:33,417
Of course I know him. He is Amar Sethi.

867
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:37,500
- He is a regular at my canteen.
- What the hell are you talking about, man?

868
01:21:37,917 --> 01:21:39,625
I have never seen him
ever in my life before.

869
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:44,292
- Amar, speak when it's your turn to speak.
- But, sir!

870
01:21:44,417 --> 01:21:47,083
And it's important for the witness
to know you,

871
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,167
and not that you should know the witness.

872
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:56,167
He is Amar Sethi.
He was in the lodge with some chick.

873
01:22:05,167 --> 01:22:09,792
I am dead sure. He can't be Brij Mohan.
He brings his car to my garage very often.

874
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:15,625
- I can never miss him even in a hurry.
- What's this nonsense?

875
01:22:15,792 --> 01:22:18,250
He is the same person who
testified before

876
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:20,375
that... Amar Sethi is a regular
at his canteen.

877
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:24,500
You are again interrupting a session.
I told you to speak when asked.

878
01:22:26,542 --> 01:22:27,708
Do you have a canteen as well?

879
01:22:29,042 --> 01:22:30,542
Did you come as a witness
sometime back?

880
01:22:30,792 --> 01:22:34,167
No, sir. I swear, this is the first time
I have even stepped in a courtroom.

881
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,333
- See! I told you, he is not that man!
- But, sir...

882
01:22:37,417 --> 01:22:38,875
Now, if you utter a word,

883
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:41,542
I will conduct the entire trial
in your absence.

884
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,750
Thank you. Next witness.

885
01:23:06,792 --> 01:23:09,750
Do you know this man here?

886
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:17,458
I have been told that he is claiming to be
Brij Mohan.

887
01:23:22,792 --> 01:23:25,000
But I have never seen this man
in my life before.

888
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:32,083
Sweetty, don't fool around,
this is not a joke!

889
01:23:33,667 --> 01:23:36,167
My Brij was the best husband ever.

890
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,708
He would have been so happy
to see me today.

891
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:42,667
You know, I have lost so much weight
since he has been gone.

892
01:23:43,542 --> 01:23:45,250
So, no, sir, this man
is not my Brij Mohan.

893
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:48,833
Are you out of your mind?
They will hang me if you say this!

894
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:50,333
He is not my husband!

895
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:55,000
You fucking bitch!
I really should have killed you!

896
01:24:14,042 --> 01:24:16,708
You ass! Stop it!

897
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:27,083
I have got five million.

898
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:40,417
You will be a free man.
Just tell us where the money is.

899
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:44,625
You will sleep in your own bed tonight
if you do so.

900
01:24:46,083 --> 01:24:48,375
- Where is the money?
- I have buried it.

901
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,750
Where?

902
01:24:49,833 --> 01:24:55,250
If I tell you that,
you will hang me right away!

903
01:24:57,208 --> 01:24:59,917
I want to get my name cleared.
I want an acquittal.

904
01:25:00,417 --> 01:25:03,292
The money will be yours.
It's all in your hands now.

905
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:11,292
Sir, why are you doing this?
I am not lying, I have the money!

906
01:25:11,792 --> 01:25:15,000
With your connections,
you can easily find out

907
01:25:15,292 --> 01:25:19,625
how much money went missing
along with Raghu.

908
01:25:20,792 --> 01:25:22,917
Find out how much cash went missing
along with Raghu.

909
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:25,500
Hurry, I'm waiting.

910
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:34,208
Sir, why are you waiting?
Please, call!

911
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:37,833
You should have thought about it earlier.

912
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,917
You have created an unnecessary mess
for yourself.

913
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,250
You would have been a free bird!

914
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:44,875
Okay, sir. I have buried
it near Sanjog Hospital.

915
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,667
Please. Please, set me free now.

916
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:59,000
I would have skinned you alive by now
if you would have lied to me.

917
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:03,250
You handover the money to us
before your hearing tomorrow.

918
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:05,792
You pay up and you will have your ticket
to your freedom.

919
01:26:06,792 --> 01:26:10,458
Sir, but you can easily bump me off
after you get the money.

920
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:11,542
Hands off!

921
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:14,667
I can bump you off even now, you ass.

922
01:26:15,042 --> 01:26:17,375
Now that you have told me about the money,
I don't need you.

923
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,958
I don't care if I take the next 15 days
to dig out the money.

924
01:26:21,458 --> 01:26:23,250
But you have got just one day. Tomorrow!

925
01:26:32,458 --> 01:26:36,458
What a judgment it is! Masterpiece!

926
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:40,500
And you guys don't want me to pass it!

927
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:46,792
I spent 20,000 to have it written
in impeccable English.

928
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:51,875
Mr. Sinha, each one of us will get
around a million!

929
01:26:52,167 --> 01:26:55,167
Don't you worry, we will not let
the judgment go waste.

930
01:26:55,583 --> 01:26:58,292
You can apply the same judgment
in a similar case, later.

931
01:26:59,417 --> 01:27:03,042
When you search on Google,
all landmark judgments are from the US.

932
01:27:03,583 --> 01:27:05,375
There's not a single one from India.

933
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:10,292
What a fabulous legal system the US has!

934
01:27:11,042 --> 01:27:15,083
Even a black man can get justice there.

935
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:17,583
And here, what we have is this!

936
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:20,917
I will be back.

937
01:27:24,417 --> 01:27:27,875
In the US, the police are so efficient.
They keep everyone in check.

938
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:32,125
The police over here behave like whores.

939
01:27:36,792 --> 01:27:38,625
Had you not been screwing around
with your duty,

940
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,292
you would have known earlier that Amar
was sitting on shit loads of money.

941
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:47,125
Really? Had you been doing your job
sincerely...

942
01:27:48,792 --> 01:27:50,708
Amar would have trusted you...

943
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:54,792
and would have confided in you
about the buried money!

944
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:56,958
Don't talk about sincerity with me.

945
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:01,625
You guys get pimped for less than a buck
at every nook and corner of the city.

946
01:28:04,917 --> 01:28:09,750
Fuck you, motherfucker!

947
01:28:15,417 --> 01:28:16,833
Keep going!

948
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:19,750
How dare you?

949
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:22,917
Fuck off!

950
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:26,083
Don't talk about my mother!
I am warning you.

951
01:28:30,917 --> 01:28:34,375
You both are fucking morons!

952
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:39,250
The only honest people in the country
are us, the judges.

953
01:28:40,875 --> 01:28:45,083
I have made a decision about Amar Sethi.

954
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:54,375
If he gets five million before noon
tomorrow...

955
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:57,917
he will walk free.

956
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:03,833
But if he doesn't, then I will read out
this judgment and that's final.

957
01:29:06,417 --> 01:29:10,208
Come on, let's go and have
an ice cream now.

958
01:29:10,708 --> 01:29:13,083
Otherwise, my acidity will start
troubling me.

959
01:29:17,792 --> 01:29:18,833
Come.

960
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:07,708
Start digging.

961
01:30:26,292 --> 01:30:27,333
Sorry, sir.

962
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:45,042
Sir, why don't you stand this side?

963
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:47,083
Why? What's troubling you here?

964
01:30:49,458 --> 01:30:54,917
I get very tense when you stand in front.
It will cause unnecessary delays.

965
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:59,750
Stop fucking around
or I will bury you alive.

966
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:02,042
Fuck it, man.

967
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:11,333
What the...

968
01:31:20,667 --> 01:31:21,542
- Sir.
- Yes.

969
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,417
Bag.

970
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:28,083
Move aside.

971
01:32:00,667 --> 01:32:02,792
<i>We Delhites have a habit
of taking the match to the wire</i>

972
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,708
<i>and then we hit the winning shot.</i>

973
01:32:05,292 --> 01:32:07,792
<i>Sehwag, Kohli... and now me!</i>

974
01:32:09,042 --> 01:32:12,167
<i>This... this was my winning shot!</i>

975
01:33:55,458 --> 01:33:56,625
Amar Sethi!

976
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:02,750
Brij!

977
01:34:10,417 --> 01:34:11,792
Brij!

978
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:30,208
<i>There are the moralists, who say
that as God has given life...</i>

979
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:34,625
he alone has the right to take it away.

980
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:44,417
<i>And this privilege cannot be usurped...</i>

981
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:48,250
<i>by any human being.</i>

982
01:34:53,167 --> 01:34:55,250
<i>And we should follow the doctrine...</i>

983
01:34:56,167 --> 01:35:00,083
and yet here we are at a juncture...

984
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:04,750
<i>where the conundrum beseeches us all.</i>

985
01:35:07,792 --> 01:35:12,083
<i>The presumptions attached to these laws
are as such,</i>

986
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:18,333
that they are meant to cater
to the societal demands...

987
01:35:19,667 --> 01:35:23,083
<i>and meet the challenges of time.</i>

988
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:30,583
Rather, Brij Mohan's life
was unceremoniously snatched

989
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:33,000
and bludgeoned to death...

990
01:35:33,792 --> 01:35:38,792
<i>which is what has weighed
with the courts in the awarding</i>

991
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:41,333
<i>the capital punishment.</i>

992
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:54,958
<i>Under the section 302
of Indian Penal Code,</i>

993
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:59,333
Amar Sethi for the murder
of Brij Mohan,

994
01:35:59,792 --> 01:36:04,958
<i>is to be sent to the gallows,
where he is to be hanged</i>

995
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:08,042
until his last breath...

996
