1
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:03,692
How great is this?

2
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:06,352
Fresh air and the endorphins.

3
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:10,102
Ooh, and the cute
little babies and dogs.

4
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:12,062
This puts everything in perspective.

5
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:13,312
I ought to do this every day.

6
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,732
I swear, I don't know why I don't.

7
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,352
(breathing hard): I need to stop.

8
00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:18,333
We <i>just</i> started.

9
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,102
Gordon hates running.

10
00:00:22,103 --> 00:00:24,402
Then why did Gordon
say "yes" to running?

11
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:25,802
Because he's insanely competitive?

12
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:26,802
What are you looking at?

13
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:27,772
(children laugh)

14
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:31,732
And yet, here you are,
wallowing in defeat.

15
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,482
This is a hard thing for me to watch.

16
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:35,232
You'll get over it.

17
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:36,562
And I sense you need to
talk to me about something

18
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:38,102
that requires a working brain,

19
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:39,812
so I'd rather not risk a stroke.

20
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:42,352
Well, at least walk
with me, you big baby.

21
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:45,602
Strangely turned on by you abusing me.

22
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:46,503
This is sensitive.

23
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:53,102
Something I haven't read my staff in on.

24
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:55,102
MIKE: Okay.

25
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:57,232
I'm starting to normalize, go.

26
00:00:57,233 --> 00:01:00,272
Last time I saw Foreign
Minister Avdonin,

27
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:01,642
he proposed a trade with me.

28
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:02,623
Do I need context?

29
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:03,692
No.

30
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:07,142
Peter Buckley for an American asset

31
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:10,602
with a great deal of personal
significance to Henry and me.

32
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,562
Previously, they told us he was dead.

33
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:14,746
Now they're saying he's not,
and we could get him back.

34
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:19,942
Now, I know the politics of
a trade can be complicated,

35
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:22,522
so I'm asking if you
could imagine a scenario

36
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:25,482
where Dalton might agree to that deal.

37
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:26,692
No. Breakfast?

38
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:29,312
Come on.

39
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:31,296
You're really gonna make
me step this out for you?

40
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:33,812
First, to clarify, Peter Buckley,

41
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:35,762
the most notorious
American spy in history.

42
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,482
- Responsible for the deaths
- I know that.

43
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:38,732
of six CIA agents,

44
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:39,942
Two of whom, Dalton,

45
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:42,272
former Director of the
CIA, knew personally.

46
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:43,852
That Peter Buckley? I'm sorry,

47
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,942
I actually do need context

48
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:46,852
as to why you would ask
me anything so stupid.

49
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:49,352
Because it is incredibly important,

50
00:01:49,353 --> 00:01:50,812
and there's a clock on it.

51
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:52,482
You really made me step <i>that</i> out?

52
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:54,642
Okay. Even if Dalton would consider it,

53
00:01:54,643 --> 00:01:57,042
Russell Jackson would throw
his body in front of that train.

54
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:58,026
Making a trade like that

55
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:59,610
with the Russians, in an election year?

56
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:01,812
Even if you had monkey
pictures on both of them,

57
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:03,522
- and got them to agree,
- What are monkey pictures?

58
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,786
I highly doubt your prisoner
exchange is even legitimate.

59
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:08,312
If you think your asset is
dead, he's probably dead.

60
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:09,482
But by even

61
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:11,482
considering a trade for Buckley,

62
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:13,562
you've revealed your
attachment to your asset.

63
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:15,482
Now, Avdonin's using
that to his advantage,

64
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:17,312
claiming this dead person is alive

65
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:18,776
without having to provide any proof.

66
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:20,562
So brilliant negotiating strategy there.

67
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:22,442
I he... I hear you,

68
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:25,413
when you say you think
this is a terrible idea.

69
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:29,312
But I haven't had a moment's peace

70
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:31,352
since I realized this was possible.

71
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:33,602
I have to try.

72
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:36,522
Can't... can't you just do your thing...

73
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,522
to find out exactly how
suicidal this mission is?

74
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:40,666
I guess I could talk to some

75
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,022
of my data-wonk pollster friends,

76
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:43,522
and see what the favorability stats

77
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:44,982
would be on a Buckley trade.

78
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:46,902
And it has been almost 20 years

79
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:48,522
and people are idiots.

80
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:50,106
Long-term memory is at an all-time low,

81
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:51,522
so we've got that going for us.

82
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:52,852
Well, see?

83
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:54,953
Things are looking up already.

84
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,232
(sighs deeply)

85
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:57,963
HENRY: Hey, babe.

86
00:02:57,964 --> 00:02:58,732
Hey.

87
00:02:58,733 --> 00:02:59,942
Hey, Mom. How was your run?

88
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:02,402
It was great. I feel so clean

89
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:04,522
and healthy and... (gasps). Waffles!?

90
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:05,826
Yeah, Dad fixed the waffle iron.

91
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:06,692
Yes!

92
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:07,836
It just needed a new switch.

93
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:09,642
And he built a firepit in the backyard.

94
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:11,982
- I dug a hole and put some bricks
around it. - ELIZABETH (laughs): What?

95
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,531
Course, the Secret Service
won't let us use it.

96
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:14,127
ELIZABETH: Aw...

97
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:16,272
ALISON: And now he's talking mini-golf.

98
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:19,732
Ho! So this is Henry
McCord on sabbatical, huh?

99
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:20,942
I'm enjoying the time.

100
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:22,562
It doesn't happen that often.

101
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:24,602
And come on, we love mini-golf.

102
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:26,186
It was a Friday night thing for like...

103
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:26,852
A summer.

104
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:28,402
Two summers, at least.

105
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:29,301
You sure have been jazzed

106
00:03:29,302 --> 00:03:30,902
about all these
life-affirming activities

107
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:32,401
since your weekend with a think tank

108
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:34,104
- in San Diego.
- I've got the time off.

109
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:35,649
I think I should take advantage of it.

110
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,402
So, come on,

111
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:38,163
who's in? Mini-golf tonight.

112
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:40,142
Um, I can't.

113
00:03:40,143 --> 00:03:41,968
I have to see Jareth tonight.

114
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:44,267
'Cause he just accepted a...

115
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:45,517
two-year fellowship in Oxford,

116
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,622
so we have to talk about
how we're going to do the...

117
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:48,141
(sighs)

118
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:48,966
long-distance thing.

119
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,017
ELIZABETH: Gosh,

120
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:52,057
honey, that... that's
rough, but you know what?

121
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:52,961
Your dad and I did it.

122
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:53,848
A lot of people do it.

123
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:54,807
ELIZABETH: Yeah.

124
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:55,897
You'll-you'll figure it out.

125
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:57,380
- Hey, uh, you know what would really
clear your minds, - STEVIE: Dad.

126
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:59,644
- Give you some perspective...
Mini-golf. - Don't... Dad.

127
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:01,017
I'm serious. Just ask Jareth.

128
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:02,727
He's British. He's got to like golf.

129
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:03,387
Mini-golf.

130
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:04,887
Hey, help me out.

131
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:05,723
Alison, Jason.

132
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:07,428
- All right. Fine. I'm in.
- Yeah, me, too.

133
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:08,347
I'll ask him.

134
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,727
Joe and Mimma's after

135
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:11,407
- for gooey calzones, yeah?
- They bought.

136
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:12,307
Stop selling.

137
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:14,307
Well, they'll get into
it once we're there.

138
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:15,948
I'm sure.

139
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:20,847
So aside from fixing the waffle iron,

140
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:22,597
and building a firepit,

141
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:24,427
and obsessing about mini-golf,

142
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,637
everything okay post Islamabad?

143
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:28,427
It's fine.

144
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:30,807
'Cause, you know, we
could always go back

145
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:32,637
and see Dr. Sherman.

146
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:34,597
Honestly, I just want to immerse myself

147
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:36,677
in mindless activities for a while.

148
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:37,948
Okay.

149
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:41,427
Not counting on me
for mini-golf, are you?

150
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:44,395
Uh, after the last time, I don't think
you're allowed back there,

151
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:46,011
- 'cause you threw...
- I did not throw that club.

152
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:46,698
All... all right.

153
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:47,517
I...I...

154
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:49,189
- ...was gesturing.
- Yeah, tell that

155
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,533
- and it slipped. My hands were wet.
- to the lady who's...

156
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:53,764
- We'll miss you.
- I think it was raining.

157
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,028
JAY: <i>Our intel is that</i>

158
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,608
all remnants of Hizb Al-Shahid
have gone underground.

159
00:04:57,609 --> 00:04:59,568
Even the remaining stolen uranium

160
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,568
has been found and
seized by American forces.

161
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:02,632
Yeah, their press releases

162
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:05,818
are all full of optimism,
and national pride.

163
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,188
Global response has been positive,

164
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:09,818
with just a handful
of the usual suspects

165
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,122
grumbling about U.S. aggression.

166
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:14,528
From a polling data and optics
perspective, we're on course.

167
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:16,858
Okay. Good. Um,

168
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,608
No Matt, today?

169
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,032
Commencement season. He's holed up.

170
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:23,528
Apparently, he's agreed to
write six speeches this year.

171
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,278
Yeah, including mine.

172
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,608
Oh, who are the lucky graduates?

173
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:28,709
UMASS Pittsfield.

174
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,648
(clears throat) They have quite a
respected foreign policy program.

175
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:33,512
And they asked first.

176
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:35,408
The Secretary's a big
fan of "asked first."

177
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,818
- (chair squeaking)
- Was that Dr. McCord's strategy, ma'am?

178
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,238
(laughs) Possibly.

179
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,579
I have an appointment.

180
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,478
It's personal. Spontaneous.

181
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,528
Whimsical, even.

182
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:47,629
It's fine. I'm reachable.

183
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:52,339
I know what that is.

184
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,924
Madam Secretary.

185
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:54,648
Yeah.

186
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:55,608
Oh, you're leaving?

187
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:56,818
I'll be back.

188
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,028
I was working on your
commencement speech,

189
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:59,738
and I was hoping you could give me

190
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:00,898
some personal anecdote

191
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,318
that-that proffers
some nugget of wisdom

192
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,528
that we could give the kids.

193
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,648
Uh, saving the Pacific Rim
Trade Agreement, for example.

194
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,358
Détente with Russia.

195
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,622
Dropping the embargo with Cuba.

196
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:12,278
I mean, there's a lot of good options.

197
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,782
Yeah, I-I-I don't know if any of that

198
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:15,978
really jibes with my overall message.

199
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,648
You have an overall message?

200
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:20,478
I don't know. Do I?

201
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,568
I'm just data-gathering,
but I'm open to your ideas.

202
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:24,858
I... let me... let me mull it over.

203
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:27,068
See if I can come up with a message,

204
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:28,818
or even a theme.

205
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:30,898
Ooh, a theme would be awesome.

206
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,278
Oh, what about the chrysalis thing?

207
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,648
A caterpillar into the butterfly...?

208
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:38,028
Are you messing with me?

209
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,738
(bell tolling slowly)

210
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,778
ELIZABETH: Anton, thank you for agreeing

211
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,478
to meet on short notice.

212
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,648
ANTON: The last time we
did this, it worked out.

213
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,608
ELIZABETH: It did. Those boys

214
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,398
made it safely home
from Syria. Thank you.

215
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,398
You're still a cultural attaché, huh?

216
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,528
Yes.

217
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,108
The work itself is quite dull,

218
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:02,568
but the quality of life
makes it all worthwhile.

219
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:06,778
Katarina got into Harvard, early action.

220
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:08,539
Congratulations.

221
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,478
I need information

222
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,898
on a Russian army
captain, Dmitri Petrov.

223
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,648
Officially, he died from a fever

224
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,608
he contracted while stationed in Ukraine

225
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:20,524
during the conflict.

226
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:21,478
Yes.

227
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,818
Officially, that is how
every Russian soldier

228
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,688
who died at the front met his fate.

229
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:28,858
Our young men are impervious to bullets,

230
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:31,608
but, sadly, suffer from weak lungs.

231
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:33,738
I have reason to
believe he's still alive,

232
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:35,858
but I need hard evidence.
Incontrovertible.

233
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:37,528
And why do you care so much

234
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:39,499
about this particular
Russian army captain?

235
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,648
I know you do realize that I'm friends

236
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,192
with the dean of admission at Harvard.

237
00:07:45,193 --> 00:07:49,778
I'm sure Katarina got
in on her own merits,

238
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,818
but you did list me as a reference,

239
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:56,398
and I had some free
time, and I made a call.

240
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,039
I will do my best, Madam Secretary.

241
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,499
Thank you.

242
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,642
(music playing, golf
ball plinking into cup)

243
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:14,421
HENRY: Have anything like
this in the UK, Jareth?

244
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:15,631
JARETH (chuckles): No, sir.

245
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:17,272
Golf's quite a serious
pursuit over there.

246
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:19,102
STEVIE: It's fine to think it's goofy.

247
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:20,442
Part of its charm.

248
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:27,791
Your turn, dingus. Go.

249
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:29,591
Um, I'll pass on this one.

250
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,815
I know those guys from school.

251
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:32,001
But what about your score?

252
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:32,819
What was...?

253
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,211
It's already the size
of the national debt.

254
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:36,551
Let her go.

255
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:39,841
Hello, hole-in-one.

256
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:40,852
HENRY: Oh, sorry.

257
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:49,631
You know what? This is ridiculous.

258
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:50,841
The clowns and the windmills

259
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:51,825
and the jumping dolphins

260
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:53,291
are supposed to convey an atmosphere

261
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:54,771
of family fun, while the game itself

262
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:56,155
is just designed to infuriate you.

263
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:58,381
Okay, look, just take a
deep breath. It's okay.

264
00:08:58,382 --> 00:08:59,527
It's all right.

265
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:00,772
I'm getting a snow cone.

266
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:03,671
I counsel we skip this one.

267
00:09:03,672 --> 00:09:05,482
Just give ourselves twos and move on.

268
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:10,501
Sorry, this isn't exactly the
kind of outing I'd planned.

269
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:11,501
No, it's fine. I'm having a lovely time.

270
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:13,251
Um, wh-while... while
I've got you a moment,

271
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,155
- there's something I wanted to ask you.
- Sure.

272
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:16,711
Um, I know Stevie's already told you

273
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:18,671
that I accepted a fellowship at Oxford.

274
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:21,051
Yes. Oh, wow, I-I know
you're going to work

275
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:22,711
- the relationship part out.
- Yeah.

276
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,655
Elizabeth and I did it
when I was in the Marines,

277
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:26,679
and that was before Skype
and JetBlue and all that.

278
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,631
Yeah. Oh, oh, see, uh,
uh, about that, um...

279
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:31,522
see, the thing is, Dr. McCord, um...

280
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:36,751
The thing is, I'm hopelessly
in love with your daughter.

281
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:39,631
And I don't... I don't want to imagine

282
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:42,751
my life without her. I...

283
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:46,751
I don't want to go off to
Oxford without this settled,

284
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:52,091
um, and so, I suppose,
I'm rather awkwardly, uh,

285
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,812
asking your blessing to propose to her.

286
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:00,591
Propose...

287
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:02,072
Marriage?

288
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:03,631
That's what I said.

289
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:05,791
I mean, don't these kids
have other steps, first?

290
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:06,627
The way we did.

291
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:07,461
I know.

292
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:09,631
Like... living together.

293
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:10,461
Breaking up,

294
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:11,547
and living together.

295
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:12,631
We didn't break up.

296
00:10:12,632 --> 00:10:14,751
I-I just needed a
little time to freak out.

297
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:15,961
It was the worst

298
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,501
- five days of my life.
- Three.

299
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:20,341
Followed by the greatest proposal ever.

300
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:23,751
Yes, the discount skywriter.

301
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:25,711
"Mar Me Elibet."

302
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:26,921
Hey, it worked.

303
00:10:26,922 --> 00:10:28,791
It did. But wait...

304
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,812
So what did you say?

305
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:32,982
I said yes.

306
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,062
Without talking to me?

307
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:38,591
Wow!

308
00:10:38,592 --> 00:10:43,381
Did you guys just
full-on Edith Wharton this

309
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:45,961
and act like my voice
wasn't going to matter?

310
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:48,812
Did you negotiate a dowry?

311
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:51,671
I-I... honestly,
babe, I was so stunned,

312
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:53,841
I might have actually
turned into an idiot.

313
00:10:53,842 --> 00:10:55,711
- Huh.
- It was really more E.M. Forster

314
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:57,501
'cause of the whole English thing.

315
00:10:57,502 --> 00:11:00,001
Look, it was just...

316
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:02,551
It's just a formality, anyway.

317
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:04,751
He's going to do what he wants.

318
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:07,501
Well, what do we say if she says yes?

319
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:08,461
I don't know.

320
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:12,671
He's such a great guy,
but they're so young.

321
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,501
That's what we say.

322
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:18,501
We love Jareth,

323
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:21,631
but we will love him
even more in two years.

324
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:24,091
Okay, let's just see what happens.

325
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:26,051
It's just getting engaged.

326
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,591
Exactly, exactly.

327
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:29,591
And they can take their
time getting married.

328
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:33,711
I mean, some-some...
engagements go on forever.

329
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:36,591
My brother and Sophie?

330
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:38,711
(scoffs) Oh, yeah,
like, 15 years, right?

331
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:40,615
- (laughing): Yeah.
- Did they ever get married?

332
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,501
I don't know. I think so.

333
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,501
(sighs) You know what,

334
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:47,841
this... is kind of a champagne problem.

335
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:52,501
I mean, this terrific guy with
a fellowship to Oxford in physics

336
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:54,961
wants to marry our daughter.

337
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:56,501
I think we'll survive.

338
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:57,192
(laughing): Yeah.

339
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:57,982
(chuckles)

340
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:04,881
Oh, Henry.

341
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,852
Our baby.

342
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:13,562
I know.

343
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:17,251
JAY: <i>After your commencement address,</i>

344
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:19,751
you'll be joining the school's president

345
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:20,921
for a luncheon in his home.

346
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:23,131
(gasps) Gordon, come here, good buddy.

347
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:24,501
Come here, come on, Gordon.

348
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:25,591
There's a good boy.

349
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:27,591
Mike B., you can come in.

350
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:28,551
Hi.

351
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:30,751
Are we doing this
here, in front of them?

352
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:34,211
Always a pleasure to see you too, Mike.

353
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,635
I'm ready to read them in. Here,
you go walk with Uncle Mike.

354
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,946
Oh, come here. All
right. Who raised you?

355
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:40,751
ELIZABETH: So, uh,

356
00:12:40,752 --> 00:12:44,091
had Mike B. running
some favorability numbers

357
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:47,841
on the idea of trading Peter
Buckley to the Russians.

358
00:12:47,842 --> 00:12:49,835
Obviously, that does
not leave this room.

359
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:50,746
Well, it ain't pretty.

360
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:53,349
48% say they'd view
the trade unfavorably.

361
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,018
Well, that's less than 50.

362
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,058
With 32% saying they'd view
it "extremely unfavorably."

363
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:59,218
Oh.

364
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:00,842
And how would they view President Dalton

365
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:01,978
for making such a trade?

366
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:05,348
Ah, that came in at 78%:
"What are you, nuts?"

367
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,018
Figured as much.

368
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,218
That's why you're here.

369
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:10,058
Wha...?

370
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,558
I have no idea what's going on.

371
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,218
It's Washington. Who does?

372
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:15,388
I want you to put together a package

373
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:18,178
of inducements of equal or greater value

374
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:19,522
to the Russians as Peter Buckley.

375
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:20,348
Can you do that?

376
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:23,598
I can try, but it'll have
to be pretty damn enticing.

377
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:25,178
He's kind of a white whale for them.

378
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,978
And who or what would we be

379
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:29,138
getting in return?

380
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:32,348
Let's just say another white whale.

381
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:34,333
Understood, ma'am.

382
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,414
Great, now that we're done
speaking in Melville code,

383
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,262
can we have the room?

384
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:41,072
You and I have other
problems to discuss.

385
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:48,012
Really?

386
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:49,642
Really.

387
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:51,012
Really.

388
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:52,642
Fine.

389
00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:54,866
My friend also told me that
his company was commissioned

390
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,227
by an unnamed entity...
read: the White House...

391
00:13:57,228 --> 00:13:59,637
to do a poll on three
people: Albert Kopp,

392
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,597
Lloyd Frost and Calvin Hastings.

393
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:03,643
So?

394
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:04,727
They're all heavy-hitters

395
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:06,597
with foreign policy credentials.

396
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:08,427
In fact, they were on the short list

397
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,051
- (snoring)
- after Secretary Marsh died.

398
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:11,712
The White House is looking to dump you.

399
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,927
(laughing): Oh, come on.

400
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:16,578
What...?

401
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:22,727
First of all, Conrad is a friend.

402
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,448
Uh-huh.

403
00:14:25,518 --> 00:14:27,347
And secondly,

404
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:29,427
I-I-I've had a few successes.

405
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:31,427
Listen, you could be Thomas Jefferson,

406
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,891
but I'm telling you, it looks
like you're about to get canned.

407
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:35,517
Why?

408
00:14:35,518 --> 00:14:36,477
It's an election year.

409
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:38,698
There... there could
be a million reasons.

410
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:44,977
Well, thank you for the
heads up, Mike, but...

411
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:47,807
I'm not worried.

412
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:50,477
And now that that's settled,

413
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:52,807
let's let the secretary
get back to work.

414
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,578
Sure. Why not?

STEVIE: Well, he didn't just ask me.

428
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:41,223
- He put this ring in the parfait,
- Ring?

429
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:42,473
and I almost choked on it.

430
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,513
- Ring?
- Let me see.

431
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:44,803
Yeah, I forgot.

432
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:47,473
Um, yeah, and he got down
on one knee and-and...

433
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:49,473
(laughing): the whole
restaurant was watching.

434
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:51,853
- Oh!
- They all applauded when I said yes.

435
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:53,853
Wow, because you said yes.

436
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:55,893
Of course you did, with that ring.

437
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:57,303
Oh, it's a family heirloom.

438
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:58,119
Yeah.

439
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,973
Oh. Mm!

440
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:00,643
Well, congratulations.

441
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:02,183
Uh, that...

We-we couldn't be
happier for you, really.

443
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:05,473
And we're sure the date is way off.

444
00:16:05,474 --> 00:16:07,563
'Cause you got to finish
college and law school.

445
00:16:07,564 --> 00:16:09,827
Oh, why are we...? We don't
need to think about that now.

446
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:10,893
Let's not.

447
00:16:10,894 --> 00:16:12,803
Let's... let's have that champagne.

448
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,473
Well, actually, it's not that far.

449
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,303
We were thinking we-we might
have it in DC at the courthouse.

450
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:18,887
STEVIE: Yeah, we-we
already have a date.

451
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:20,013
It's, uh, this weekend.

452
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:20,764
Wow!

459
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:30,353
Um, just a minute.

461
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:32,013
(chuckles)

462
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:34,433
(whispering): Are we united
that this is too fast?

463
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,393
(whispering): Way too fast.

464
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:38,393
MIKE: Okay, I've done my homework,

465
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:40,263
and here's where we are.

466
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:42,723
First up, Albert Kopp,
deputy secretary under Marsh,

467
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:45,579
now works in the private
sector consulting for an NGO.

468
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,248
I knew him well.

469
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,208
(sighs) The plagiarism
scandal from years ago

470
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,288
is probably behind him,

471
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:54,868
but the "everyone in
bureaucracy hated him" scandal

472
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:56,368
most likely is not.

473
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:59,708
I doubt Dalton would hoist
him on the rank and file.

474
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,038
Lloyd Frost.

475
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,078
Former high-ranking military officer,

476
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,658
two-term congressman and
ex-ambassador to Indonesia.

477
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,082
Frost would never relocate to DC...

478
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,208
Because his mistress lives in San Diego.

479
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,208
Yes, I know.

480
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,208
Okay.

481
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:15,418
Calvin Hastings, former
ambassador to the UN.

482
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:16,882
Plenty of foreign policy experience.

483
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:18,118
And he's from a purple state,

484
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,418
so his constituency
would be useful to Dalton.

485
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:21,748
Uh-huh.

486
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,078
His wife is a veteran.

487
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,418
They have three beautiful children.

488
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,748
And he has a history of
outside-the-box thinking.

489
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,788
If anything, he's a
Secretary McCord 2.0.

490
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:34,158
And he's clean.

491
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:36,658
Well...

492
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:38,328
if you can't find dirt
on him, nobody can.

493
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:41,208
Thank you.

494
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:42,328
Frankly, I think he'd make

495
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,828
a more useful secretary than Elizabeth.

496
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,708
Because he's from a swing state.

497
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:47,929
Relax.

498
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:54,158
I miss my shoes.

499
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,708
ELIZABETH: <i>Well, that was brutal.</i>

500
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:01,708
All that champagne and terrible ideas.

501
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:04,328
My face hurts from fake smiling.

502
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:06,418
How do you think my tongue
feels from me biting it?

503
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,288
She's going to put school

504
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,158
on hold and maybe

505
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,748
find work in a pub... she did say pub.

506
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:17,708
For the experience of immersing herself

507
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:18,958
in the culture?

508
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,742
Oh, yeah, we are gonna
have to say something.

509
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:23,458
Oh, you are definitely
gonna have to say something.

510
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:26,248
Really?

511
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:31,158
You're going to have to make her
understand about concrete plans,

512
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,918
and-and contingency
plans, and future PLA...

513
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,562
you're just gonna have to explain plans.

514
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:38,587
Look, I know you're upset

515
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:40,342
you weren't consulted
about the proposal,

516
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,342
- Yeah! - but now I'm the
one that has to tell her

517
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:43,686
she's about to screw up her life?

518
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,049
Yes, and now is not a good time

519
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,668
for me to confront my contradictions.

520
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,168
I just need you to stop
this from happening.

521
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:51,498
Okay, okay, I'll do my best.

522
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:56,298
I-It is like my entire
history of parental guidance

523
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:58,708
is-is being erased.

524
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,378
There's no bank.

525
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:02,588
Nothing that I have done

526
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:05,758
up to this point matters.

527
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,878
Is this all about Stevie?

528
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:09,269
Yes! Maybe.

529
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:12,668
I don't know.

530
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:14,769
What's going on?

531
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:17,758
Conrad's looking to replace me.

532
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,519
What?! Says who?

533
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:23,548
Mike B.

534
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:26,088
Mike B., come on, that guy

535
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:29,498
dines out on controversy and bad news.

536
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:33,758
Yes, and as a result, he
has a jump on everything.

537
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,628
That's got to be some
kind of crazy rumor.

538
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:37,708
Conrad would never do that to you.

539
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,798
You've been so loyal.

540
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,088
I find it inconceivable
that he would turn on you

541
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:42,258
like this.

542
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:44,628
Well, it is Washington

543
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:48,128
and there is an election coming up,

544
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:50,399
and the crazy thing is...

545
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,208
...until now, I didn't even realize

546
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,559
how much I've come to love the job.

547
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,269
That's the first time I've
ever heard you say that.

548
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:07,809
I know.

549
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:17,740
BLAKE: <i>Uh, good morning, ma'am.</i>

550
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:18,740
<i>Uh, you received a call</i>

551
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:19,820
from an Anton Durchenko

552
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:21,490
from the Russian Embassy.

553
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:22,490
- Yeah.
- Uh...

554
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:23,870
He's a cultural attaché.

555
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:25,174
He-he-he says that you know him.

556
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:26,910
Yeah, from my CIA days.

557
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:29,160
Oh, well, uh, he called to
invite you to a concert today

558
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,910
at the Russian Embassy.

559
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:33,240
I told him you were very
busy but he insisted that

560
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,780
you would be interested.

561
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:37,280
It's, uh, <i>Rachmaninoff's
String Quartet Number 1.</i>

562
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:38,881
Okay, clear my afternoon.

563
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:40,740
R-Really?

564
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:43,490
Yeah, I could use a little break.

565
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:45,080
Tell Anton I'm coming.

566
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:47,160
Uh, yes, ma'am.

567
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:49,620
Bring you back some caviar and vodka.

568
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:50,780
Oh, please, don't.

569
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:52,881
I'm cleansing.

570
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:55,921
<i>(Rachmaninoff's String
Quartet Number 1 plays)</i>

571
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:23,921
That's all the
documentation I could find.

572
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,301
<i>(String Quartet Number
1 continues playing)</i>

573
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:56,761
(sighs)

574
00:21:58,621 --> 00:21:59,820
ELIZABETH: <i>Minister Avdonin,</i>

575
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,910
where did you think this road would lead

576
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:05,030
when you decided to manipulate me

577
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:06,660
and the United States Government?

578
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:08,990
It took exactly one move from me

579
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:11,030
to find the proof that Captain Dmitri

580
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:12,080
Petrov is dead.

581
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,950
Madam Secretary, forgive me,

582
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:16,370
but I have to call into
question this so-called proof

583
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:17,820
that you claim to have.

584
00:22:17,821 --> 00:22:19,660
Oh, it was-it was pretty convincing.

585
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:21,030
Dmitri Petrov's treachery

586
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:23,200
had to remain secret to the public

587
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:26,200
at large, but in order
to maintain the appearance

588
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:28,700
of strength among the
military's officer class,

589
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:32,870
President Salnikov falsified
the captain's execution.

590
00:22:32,871 --> 00:22:36,740
I saw a photo of him
with a bullet in his head.

591
00:22:36,741 --> 00:22:38,080
What can I say?

592
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:39,921
We're very good at what we do.

593
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:44,080
I want proof of life
before we can proceed.

594
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:45,410
No.

595
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:47,740
President Salnikov wants to maintain

596
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,370
the pretense of Dmitri's death.

597
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:52,780
He will not risk exposing this operation

598
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:55,910
for anything short of
Peter Buckley's freedom.

599
00:22:55,911 --> 00:22:58,740
It's the reason why he
kept the traitor alive.

600
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:00,910
Now he sees that the time is right,

601
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:03,240
given such high-level interest.

602
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:06,740
I would only consider
moving forward with the trade

603
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:10,261
if there was a good faith gesture.

604
00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:14,950
Dmitri Petrov's sister Talia released

605
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:17,080
from prison in advance.

606
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:19,660
That can be arranged.

607
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:22,120
I will process the orders right away.

608
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:25,120
But as for Dmitri,
it's Buckley or nothing.

609
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:27,120
And I'm running out of patience.

610
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:30,051
Good-bye, Madam Secretary.

611
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:32,910
Ma'am, a word?

612
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,910
We have proof.

613
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:34,854
You're on your way out.

614
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:36,450
We have some rather unsettling news,

615
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:37,611
but I wouldn't call it proof.

616
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:39,146
They're gonna be moving the
furniture out while you're

617
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:40,910
- protecting her feelings.
- Just tell me.

618
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:42,780
Calvin Hastings' wife
moved heaven and earth

619
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:44,284
to get their child put on a wait list

620
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:45,950
for the Circle of Friends preschool,

621
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:47,254
which is the finger paint feeder

622
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:48,910
for all the best prep schools in DC.

623
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:51,120
Hastings doesn't even have
a preschool-aged child.

624
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:52,780
He will soon enough.

625
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:55,091
His wife is six months pregnant.

626
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:01,091
Damn it.

627
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,160
Hey. I was just coming to find you.

628
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,666
I have a draft. It's rough,

629
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,823
- but I think it's pretty good.
- (sighs) The commencement speech.

630
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:10,551
I-I can't.

631
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:11,320
You can't what?

632
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:13,990
I-I can't do it.
There's a lot going on.

633
00:24:13,991 --> 00:24:14,952
It's complicated.

634
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,604
Bailing on them at this
point, all due respect,

635
00:24:17,605 --> 00:24:18,817
- is pretty rude.
- I'm not bailing on them.

636
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:19,543
I'm sending you.

637
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:20,558
Wait, wait, what?!

638
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,160
Look, you wrote the speech.
It's all you.

639
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,950
And, besides, the kids will
relate to you more. Thank you.

640
00:24:25,951 --> 00:24:27,950
I'll coordinate it. Just trust me.

641
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:29,990
Madam Secretary, they're
really expecting you.

642
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:31,870
I'm-I'm gonna be a big disappointment.

643
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,910
Look, I'll make a
contribution to the school.

644
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:36,080
I'll take individual
meetings with the graduates.

645
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:37,910
- How many?
- 400.

646
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,530
(sighs) We'll figure it out. And, Matt,

647
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:42,950
you're not gonna be a disappointment.

648
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:45,181
You're gonna crush it.

649
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:52,370
Elise.

650
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:54,530
Russell...

651
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,530
(chuckling): Now that I'm
on the other side of this,

652
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:59,120
it is pretty rude.

653
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:00,370
We need to talk.

654
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:03,370
Yes, we do.

655
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:06,200
You need to drop the
Peter Buckley thing.

656
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:10,080
Look, I have no idea why you'd want

657
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:12,030
to give up a traitor to the Russians.

658
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:15,160
All I know is that you have no
business even discussing this

659
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:16,780
in the middle of an election.

660
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:20,301
And why should I listen to
this when I'm losing my job?

661
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:24,160
Yeah.

662
00:25:24,161 --> 00:25:26,820
Two can play at the omniscience game.

663
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:29,240
I know that you are planning on offering

664
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:31,820
my position to Calvin Hastings.

665
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,971
(sighs) Look...

666
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:38,449
I can't talk about this.

667
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:46,341
You're not even denying it?

668
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:51,580
You need to talk to the president, soon.

669
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:54,280
He's in Chicago at a fund-raiser.

670
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:56,080
He'll be back tomorrow.

671
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:58,410
I'll get you a face-to-face with him.

672
00:25:58,411 --> 00:26:01,080
Don't bring up Buckley.

673
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:02,160
We'll see about that.

674
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:04,011
(door shuts)

675
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:12,221
(sighs)

676
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:25,394
HENRY: <i>We love Jareth.</i>

677
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:27,184
We think he's a great guy.

678
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,415
But you're rushing into
this marriage too quickly.

679
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:33,014
No, just "rushing."

680
00:26:33,015 --> 00:26:35,564
"Rushing" is "quickly."
You don't need both.

681
00:26:35,565 --> 00:26:38,474
You're rushing into
this marriage. And why?

682
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:39,814
Marriage is forever,

683
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,758
and forever is a lot
longer than you think it is.

684
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,644
This is stupid.

685
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,474
Okay.

686
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:48,354
Just go out there and start talking.

687
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:49,814
It can't be that hard.

688
00:26:49,815 --> 00:26:51,354
STEVIE: <i>Yeah, but isn't an up-do,</i>

689
00:26:51,355 --> 00:26:52,520
like, too much going on?

690
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:53,724
Not if it's casual,

691
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:55,394
- like a modified ballerina bun
- Yeah.

692
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:56,564
or a messy French twist.

693
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:59,088
Oh, you mean the ones that
messy, like, have to look messy

694
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:00,799
but you can't actually have
them be mess... (laughs)

695
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,514
That's the magic.

696
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:02,954
- Thank God you're here.
- Hey, Dad.

697
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,354
Hey. It's just a dry run.

698
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:07,684
Um, the big day is still on Saturday.

699
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:09,724
You look beautiful.

700
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:11,274
Noodle, could we have a minute?

701
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:13,184
Of course.

702
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:14,205
Thank you.

703
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:15,274
(grunts)

704
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:17,000
You look so beautiful. Seriously.

705
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,825
Thanks, Ali.

706
00:27:20,185 --> 00:27:22,604
So...

707
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:24,514
is this the big sentimental dad talk

708
00:27:24,515 --> 00:27:26,535
about sending me off into the world?

709
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,705
Not exactly.

710
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:32,665
Okay.

711
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:36,814
Look...

712
00:27:36,815 --> 00:27:39,224
Mom and I are concerned that...

713
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:41,325
It's too soon, isn't it?

714
00:27:45,395 --> 00:27:46,495
Yes.

715
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:51,825
Oh, God.

716
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:56,774
I was wondering when one
of you was gonna stop me

717
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,564
from doing something incredibly...

718
00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:01,394
impulsive and stupid,

719
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:04,394
which this does feel like it is.

720
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:07,514
But at the same time...

721
00:28:07,515 --> 00:28:10,104
I love him, and...

722
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,564
I don't want to lose him.

723
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,495
And I know that he's the forever guy.

724
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:18,684
I just don't know that I want
to start forever right now.

725
00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:21,564
Right. Because forever is a
lot longer than you think it is.

726
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:25,224
I just didn't know what
to say when he proposed.

727
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:28,564
I mean, people were watching.

728
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:31,274
And it was so romantic!

729
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:34,684
And he's the greatest guy... ever.

730
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:39,455
Being willing to take
that risk, you know?

731
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:46,434
Commitment is really hard to find in...

732
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,274
people my age.

733
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:49,705
Or anybody.

734
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,745
How can I just throw all of that away?

735
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:04,974
You don't have to.

736
00:29:04,975 --> 00:29:07,514
And you shouldn't.

737
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:08,604
We love Jareth.

738
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:09,750
(quiet laugh)

739
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:10,934
Uh...

740
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:13,604
We just think that...

741
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:16,394
if you're willing to
commit to a life together,

742
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:19,644
then that's not going anywhere.

743
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:23,434
It'll stand the test of time.

744
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:25,739
I'm speaking in clichés now,
exclusively. I just can't...

745
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,514
That's okay.

746
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,514
- Dad, you're a little freaked out.
- I am.

747
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:29,875
So am I. (chuckles)

748
00:29:31,315 --> 00:29:32,644
Okay.

749
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,285
♪ ♪

750
00:29:37,895 --> 00:29:40,474
(sighs)

751
00:29:40,475 --> 00:29:42,014
Tell me what you know, Bess.

752
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:44,934
That you made an unofficial
offer to Calvin Hastings

753
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:47,434
to replace me as secretary of state.

754
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:50,564
Hastings hasn't unofficially accepted.

755
00:29:50,565 --> 00:29:52,331
I was hoping to bring
you into the circle

756
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,035
- when the situation...
- I've been told by

757
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:55,388
Foreign Minister Avdonin

758
00:29:55,389 --> 00:29:56,934
that Dmitri Petrov is alive.

759
00:29:56,935 --> 00:29:59,934
They'll give him his freedom
in exchange for Peter Buckley.

760
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:02,615
(sighs) Here we go.

761
00:30:04,895 --> 00:30:06,375
Give us a moment.

762
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:12,394
(door opens)

763
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,495
(door shuts)

764
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:20,894
You need to let this go.

765
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:22,014
Not a chance.

766
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:24,814
After everything that I have done

767
00:30:24,815 --> 00:30:26,564
in service to you and
this administration,

768
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:29,724
only to find myself turned out

769
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:32,811
at the first glimmer
of political expediency?

770
00:30:32,812 --> 00:30:33,313
Bess...

771
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:36,854
Not to mention the sacrifices
my whole family made,

772
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:39,854
especially Henry, who did
his best to put it behind him

773
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:41,774
and support you after his own asset

774
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:43,514
was surrendered to the greater good.

775
00:30:43,515 --> 00:30:46,774
Do you have any idea the
stress that put on us?

776
00:30:46,775 --> 00:30:50,724
We survived it because we did
have a bigger picture in mind,

777
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:53,514
because we did serve
at the pleasure of a man

778
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:55,684
we both respected

779
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:58,104
and admired and trusted.

780
00:30:58,105 --> 00:30:59,934
And now this? You're firing me?

781
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:02,934
Bess, I'm not firing you.

782
00:31:02,935 --> 00:31:05,705
I'm trying to ask you
to be my vice president.

783
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:08,535
Oh.

784
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:12,434
What?!

785
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:15,774
Mark Delgado has serious health issues.

786
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:18,314
It's just not a viable
job for him anymore.

787
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:19,934
It was a very short list

788
00:31:19,935 --> 00:31:23,724
when it came to his replacement.

789
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:26,035
Only one name on it.

790
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:31,934
I'm going to need your
help on the campaign trail.

791
00:31:31,935 --> 00:31:36,514
But more importantly, I'm
going to need your wise counsel

792
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:38,644
on all matters, foreign and domestic.

793
00:31:38,645 --> 00:31:40,474
I didn't want to bring you into this

794
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:44,974
until I had a solid choice
for secretary of state.

795
00:31:44,975 --> 00:31:47,785
That person has some
pretty big shoes to fill.

796
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:51,724
(sighing): Uh...

797
00:31:51,725 --> 00:31:54,724
Mr. President...

798
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:57,825
I don't know what to say.

799
00:31:59,475 --> 00:32:01,644
First of all, thank you.

800
00:32:01,645 --> 00:32:03,564
Um...

801
00:32:03,565 --> 00:32:05,148
And I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

802
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:07,434
It's quite all right.

803
00:32:07,435 --> 00:32:08,774
(trembling sigh)

804
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:10,854
And then, um,

805
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:14,684
I suppose I'll need some time to think.

806
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:16,785
Of course.

807
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:27,394
Sir, I-I'm not... I'm
not bargaining here.

808
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:29,684
It's a separate issue, this
matter of Dmitri Petrov.

809
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:31,509
It's out of the question.
American assets were

810
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,684
sent to their deaths
when Buckley burned them.

811
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:34,685
Two of them were friends.

812
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:35,684
I know.

813
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:38,283
As the former CIA director,
you know I can't begin

814
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:41,242
to consider giving this
traitor his freedom.

815
00:32:41,243 --> 00:32:43,452
You also know that
Dmitri is probably dead.

816
00:32:43,453 --> 00:32:48,032
But while there's a
chance, we have to try.

817
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:52,242
He was one of the most
effective assets we've ever had.

818
00:32:52,243 --> 00:32:54,612
His intel may have
prevented a world war.

819
00:32:54,613 --> 00:32:57,112
Meanwhile,

820
00:32:57,113 --> 00:33:01,213
Buckley is no longer a
threat to American security.

821
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:06,162
But besides all that,

822
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:07,612
you know in your heart of hearts

823
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:08,702
that giving up Dmitri

824
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:12,322
to make that deal with Russia was wrong.

825
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,662
It was a necessary wrong.

826
00:33:14,663 --> 00:33:17,162
But it was wrong.

827
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:20,372
Here we have a chance to make it right.

828
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,553
How often do we get that?

829
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,202
Here I am, offering you

830
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:27,986
the second most important
job in the country,

831
00:33:27,987 --> 00:33:28,662
(laughs)

832
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:31,492
and you're poking at my conscience.

833
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:34,343
Any wonder why I want
you to take the job?

834
00:33:41,283 --> 00:33:44,093
Well, it looks like we both
have a lot to think about.

835
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:54,525
JARETH: <i>So, for the wedding reception,</i>

836
00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:57,525
plenty of room for mingling
but not too cavernous.

837
00:33:57,526 --> 00:34:00,935
Got craft beers on tap,
nice wine selection,

838
00:34:00,936 --> 00:34:02,565
all the small batch liquors.

839
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,605
Walks right up to precious,

840
00:34:04,606 --> 00:34:06,265
and then says, no, wait,

841
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:07,706
sophisticated.

842
00:34:08,976 --> 00:34:10,935
Yeah.

843
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:12,706
It's nice.

844
00:34:14,396 --> 00:34:17,225
Okay, so...

845
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:18,685
why does it look like you're being

846
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:19,956
led to your execution?

847
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:26,725
It's, uh, it's too soon.

848
00:34:26,726 --> 00:34:28,265
What?

849
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,185
For getting married.

850
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:30,905
- Yes, no, I put that together.
- Jareth...

851
00:34:30,906 --> 00:34:32,895
I love you so much.

852
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:36,576
And I love the idea of
marrying you, it's...

853
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:40,815
...just every time I th... I think about

854
00:34:40,816 --> 00:34:43,565
actually doing it, I...

855
00:34:43,566 --> 00:34:46,605
I kind of feel like...

856
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,895
throwing up or-or passing out,

857
00:34:48,896 --> 00:34:51,395
and-and that's not how I really

858
00:34:51,396 --> 00:34:52,331
want to feel.

859
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:53,366
No, that's not ideal.

860
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:56,025
So why can't we wait?

861
00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:57,685
Of course we can.

862
00:34:57,686 --> 00:35:00,525
It's just when I think of
being separated from you

863
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:03,666
for that long without
some kind of plan...

864
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:06,525
I don't want to risk it.

865
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:08,685
So...

866
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:09,536
let's make a plan.

867
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:13,645
I will finish out my semester here

868
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:16,855
and then I'll jo...
I'll join you in Oxford

869
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:17,916
for the summer.

870
00:35:18,856 --> 00:35:20,626
We can, we can live in a...

871
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:24,565
...charming little cottage and...

872
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:26,645
go punting...

873
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,149
Probably more like a sad little flat.

874
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,395
But I do know how to punt.

875
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:31,435
Well, I didn't actually
know that was a real thing,

876
00:35:31,436 --> 00:35:32,539
it just sounded good, so...

877
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,640
And after our idyllic summer?

878
00:35:36,526 --> 00:35:40,036
We... we figure it out. Together.

879
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:43,025
I like the together bit.

880
00:35:43,026 --> 00:35:44,866
Me, too.

881
00:35:51,436 --> 00:35:52,475
HENRY: <i>Babe?</i>

882
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:54,025
Text from Stevie.

883
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,645
"Wedding off, engagement
on, explain later."

884
00:35:57,646 --> 00:35:59,685
Oh, thank God.

885
00:35:59,686 --> 00:36:03,765
"P.S. summer in Oxford."

886
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:06,105
Sounds expensive.

887
00:36:06,106 --> 00:36:07,355
(chuckles)

888
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:09,645
Still, nice save, Professor.

889
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:12,576
Well, believe me, she was
ready for the intervention.

890
00:36:13,976 --> 00:36:15,956
I need to tell you something.

891
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:18,725
Couple of things, actually.

892
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:20,126
Yeah?

893
00:36:22,686 --> 00:36:25,475
There's a chance Dmitri's still alive.

894
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:27,605
What?

895
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:29,065
How?

896
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,815
I'm told the Russians preserved him

897
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:33,725
in the event of a chance
for a prisoner exchange,

898
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:36,525
and now that chance is here.

899
00:36:36,526 --> 00:36:39,395
Avdonin wants to swap
him for Peter Buckley.

900
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:41,685
Took some convincing,

901
00:36:41,686 --> 00:36:44,145
but Conrad's agreed to the trade.

902
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:45,475
He's alive.

903
00:36:45,476 --> 00:36:47,855
The whole thing could be a ploy.

904
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:49,065
I mean, all accessible proof,

905
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:51,605
everything except Avdonin's word,

906
00:36:51,606 --> 00:36:52,765
speaks to the contrary,

907
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:56,206
and the Russians could just
be playing us to get Buckley.

908
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,935
We wouldn't know for certain
until the actual exchange.

909
00:37:00,936 --> 00:37:04,145
When is it?

910
00:37:04,146 --> 00:37:05,475
Tomorrow night.

911
00:37:05,476 --> 00:37:06,765
Where?

912
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,815
Vartius, Finland.

913
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:10,956
Border checkpoint with Russia.

914
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,895
We need someone there

915
00:37:14,896 --> 00:37:16,475
who can identify him.

916
00:37:16,476 --> 00:37:17,475
It has to be me.

917
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:19,379
Do you really want to
put yourself through that?

918
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,725
If it isn't real, what's
that gonna do to you?

919
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:25,895
Y-you have to consider that, Henry.

920
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:30,536
In your best ex-CIA estimation,
what are the odds he's alive?

921
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:33,855
Forty-five percent.

922
00:37:33,856 --> 00:37:36,126
I have to go.

923
00:37:40,896 --> 00:37:42,666
Okay.

924
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:47,036
Then we need to pack.

925
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:49,895
What was the other thing?

926
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:52,895
Oh...

927
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,475
Conrad asked me to
be his Vice President.

928
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:56,935
Oh... what?

929
00:37:56,936 --> 00:38:00,565
ELIZABETH: Yeah, big day.

930
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:01,705
MATT: <i>Uh, good morning.</i>

931
00:38:01,706 --> 00:38:02,537
(feedback whines)

932
00:38:02,538 --> 00:38:04,161
- MAN: Good morning.
- I'd like to, uh...

933
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:06,605
(stammers)

934
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:10,036
uh, begin by stating the obvious.

935
00:38:11,106 --> 00:38:15,706
I am not Elizabeth McCord.

936
00:38:17,936 --> 00:38:20,536
I'm her speechwriter.

937
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:24,855
Believe me, uh, no one
is more disappointed that

938
00:38:24,856 --> 00:38:26,855
the secretary won't
be giving the address

939
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:28,565
that I wrote for her.

940
00:38:28,566 --> 00:38:29,855
You know, now that I know

941
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:31,399
that it'll never see the light of day,

942
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,935
I think it's safe to say that

943
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,645
it was the greatest speech ever written.

944
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,645
(audience laughs)

945
00:38:37,646 --> 00:38:39,855
I mean, honestly, uh,

946
00:38:39,856 --> 00:38:43,265
this is probably the first
moment in my adult life

947
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:45,996
that I've stood in the spotlight.

948
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:50,666
Truth be told, it's
probably gonna be the last.

949
00:38:51,856 --> 00:38:54,145
Why?

950
00:38:54,146 --> 00:38:58,025
Because I'm one of those
people who works in the dark.

951
00:38:58,026 --> 00:39:00,025
I know what you're thinking.

952
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:04,025
As soon as my Etsy
page is discovered, uh,

953
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:07,525
I'll invent my own job title
on Buzzfeed and livestream

954
00:39:07,526 --> 00:39:09,935
my Christopher Walken
impression as I hoverboard

955
00:39:09,936 --> 00:39:11,975

957
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,225
...and I don't blame you.

958
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:20,605
In this world of
relentless self-promotion,

959
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:23,935
we've all been raised to
think that the limelight

960
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:26,326
is the only light worth seeking.

961
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:30,286
But that isn't the case.

962
00:39:33,106 --> 00:39:36,605
