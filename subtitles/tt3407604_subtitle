1
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:34,536
'Welcome, family, fellow
faculty members and friends.'

2
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:37,071
'Thank you for joining us
today in the celebration of... '

3
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:39,840
'... the graduating class of 2002.'

4
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:43,842
'I proudly can say each
student standing in front of me... '

5
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:46,882
'... has not only worked hard,
but has worked honestly... '

6
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,178
'... in graduating today.'

7
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:53,257
'I only hope you can continue to
carry out this style of working... '

8
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,657
'... not only in your career,
but for the rest of your lives.'

9
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:58,421
'Graduation is
also a time to look... '

10
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:01,592
'... at what the future has
in store for each of us.'

11
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:05,071
'It is a very serious time.
A time to take a look at... '

12
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:09,097
Pal, there's
graduation day. Teacher's day.

13
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:12,577
Mother's day.
Father's day. Rose day.

14
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:13,806
Valentines day.

15
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:17,113
When will there be a Sex day?

16
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:18,811
Don't know about the Sex day.

17
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:21,077
But there will a GPL day for sure.

18
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:23,283
And that day all
you lustful people...

19
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:25,187
...will get a kick up your back side.

20
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:28,091
It's a case of sour grapes.

21
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:29,287
Right, moron.

22
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:30,829
I am nervous here.

23
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:32,326
Whether I should
propose to Anjali or not.

24
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:34,390
And the two of you
are fighting over days?

25
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,865
Look, love and all is
just meant for killing time.

26
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:41,737
I believe in just having a
good time and moving on.

27
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:43,404
You'll never be able
to say I love you...

28
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:44,876
...if you listen to
rubbish like this.

29
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:46,169
Listen to me.

30
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:48,373
Go right now and
open your heart to her.

31
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,642
Open whatever you want.

32
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:51,309
Except the heart.

33
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:53,277
Don't do this stupidity.

34
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:54,684
He does our share of it.

35
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:56,585
So why should you?
- Just chill, friends.

36
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:58,249
Don't mess my brain up.

37
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:59,451
I'll do whatever I need to.

38
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:01,751
Go and get cozy with your girls.

39
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:04,160
'2002 as graduates.'

40
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,569
Congratulations.

41
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:23,708
Good luck, brother.

42
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:25,512
Good, brother.

43
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:27,844
Yes. Yes. Say
something nice for once.

44
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:29,414
That is what I am saying.

45
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:30,749
Say something nice for once.

46
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,621
You know what? Just off.

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,252
You know what?

48
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:38,556
Just off.

49
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:40,065
'Rajveer and Aarav.'

50
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,431
'Their friendship is
like that of Jai and Veeru.'

51
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:43,728
'No. No. Tom and Jerry.'

52
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,498
'Jai and Veeru.' 'Tom and Jerry.

53
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:47,802
'Jai... ' 'Actually, nobody knows.'

54
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:49,307
'Except one.'

55
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,434
'Nikhil.'

56
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,267
Anjali, I have been trying to
woo you ever since I was a kid.

57
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:54,745
I can't live without you.
I am crazy for you.

58
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,076
I love you.

59
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,848
Anjali. - 'This is
Nikhil's rotten old love story.'

60
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:01,646
What did you just say?

61
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:05,216
You love me?

62
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:08,520
No. I guess it was a mistake.

63
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,688
Stupid.

64
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,432
You took so long to say this.

65
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:20,670
'Some people do it before marriage.'

66
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,264
'And some after marriage.'

67
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:23,835
'I mean love.'

68
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:25,469
'As in Aarav.'

69
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:27,074
Will you marry me?

70
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:28,737
What?!
- Yes.

71
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,180
Marry me.

72
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,279
Are you out of your head?

73
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:33,644
Marry me?

74
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,210
I thought you wanted to kiss me.

75
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:38,315
I thought you wanted to...

76
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:40,518
'And the result is.'
- I am leaving you.

77
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:41,686
No, baby. No, baby.
- Bye.

78
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:43,160
Just leave me.
- Please don't leave me.

79
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,330
Bugsy, don't leave me.

80
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:47,396
I'll be making up.

81
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:50,165
'And he does it before marriage.'

82
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,631
'But doesn't marry.'

83
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:53,798
What are your plans after this?

84
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,369
What do you mean?

85
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:58,076
Are you asking me for marriage?

86
00:04:58,645 --> 00:04:59,703
Are you out of your mind?

87
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:01,305
Marriage and me?

88
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:03,808
I was asking what your
plans are after graduation.

89
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,541
This is the new
brand ambassador of LSD.

90
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,164
Come on. Come on.

91
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:23,635
You can do it.
- Come on. Come on.

92
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:26,137
Yes. Yes. Yes.

93
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,399
Come on.

94
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:33,176
Friends, friends.
This is the real man.

95
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:37,148
He has agreed to our seven
conditions before getting married.

96
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:39,811
That's why Dheeraj
is our risk taker.

97
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:43,116
He is a risk taker for sure.

98
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:44,756
He is getting married at age 22.

99
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:47,190
He'll be the father of
two kids when he is 25.

100
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,557
All the important parts of
the body will stop working...

101
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:49,720
...when he is 30.

102
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,388
What will be his gifts?

103
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:52,556
Diabetes and blood pressure.

104
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,099
Pension plan at 35.

105
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,225
Old age at 40.

106
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:58,793
He'll die at 45.

107
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:00,066
I don't agree.

108
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,075
You must marry if your love is true.

109
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,375
Because marriage and kids...

110
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:06,571
Yes, my darling Rakesh.

111
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:09,010
Rajveer, market is up.

112
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:10,510
Shall we buy shares of Reliance?

113
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:11,809
Sure.

114
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:13,314
Okay. Buy 1000.

115
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:14,478
Only 1000?

116
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:16,579
I suggest let's buy 1 lakh shares.

117
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:19,216
You've to take big
risks to be a big man.

118
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:21,658
Live in relationships... All the best.
- Hello. What are you thinking?

119
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,593
Okay, I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

120
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:26,021
Friends. Friends.

121
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:29,634
I have an idea.

122
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:32,663
Let's play a game.

123
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:34,036
Game? What game?

124
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,231
Why don't you have a bet?

125
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:37,636
What bet?

126
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:42,839
Let's contribute and
buy Reliance's shares.

127
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:46,807
After a few years, the one
who doesn't get married...

128
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:49,283
...will get all the shares and money.

129
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:51,346
What kind of a bet is this?
- This is the bet.

130
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:52,516
Idiots, think about it.

131
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:55,126
Today the price of
this share is Rs.140.

132
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:57,293
1400 after a year.

133
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,793
1 lakh shares X1400.

134
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:02,126
What say, friends?

135
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:03,428
I am ready.
- Who else?

136
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:05,801
Come on. Come on.
- Friends, I am ready for the bet.

137
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,529
Because I am not going
to get married either.

138
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:11,202
Yes.
- Son, I'll be taking this money.

139
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,369
We shall see, rascal.

140
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:13,639
Me too.
- Me too. - Me too.

141
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:14,805
Superb.

142
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,106
I am only going to win.

143
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:19,276
Yes. - This means
everyone is ready except one.

144
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:22,082
Actually, even I am in.

145
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:24,052
Look, son, I suggest
don't bet on the money.

146
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:26,183
You just might be the
first one to get married.

147
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,193
I don't think so.

148
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,592
I am unlucky.

149
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:32,358
When I propose to a girl,
she runs away. - That's true.

150
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:33,760
I will come to know that
all of you have got married.

151
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,269
I am the only one left.
So let me take the plunge.

152
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:39,168
I will earn money.
If not get a girl.

153
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,332
What say?
- Okay. So, friends.

154
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:42,733
What say?

155
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:44,276
Deal? Deal?

156
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:47,438
Okay.
- Deal. Deal. Deal. Deal

157
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:33,218
That is cool.

158
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,101
Anjali, what has Nikhil said
that has got you so frustrated.

159
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,364
Then what do I do?

160
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:46,598
You know, Sneha.

161
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,698
I have always had a dream...

162
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:51,803
...that I get married out
of India on a grand level.

163
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:53,779
There is a diamond
ring in my finger.

164
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:57,544
I wear a dress designed
by Ravishankar Jaiswal.

165
00:08:57,617 --> 00:09:00,552
In fact, I had even
chosen the wedding dress.

166
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,056
But whenever I talk
about marriage...

167
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:06,588
...Nikhil comes up with an excuse.

168
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,990
Seems like he is not
interested in marriage.

169
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,054
Anjali, Nikhil is
among those who are...

170
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:14,031
...scared of committing to marriage.

171
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:18,197
You will have to break up with
him in order to marry someone else.

172
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,400
Break up?

173
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:03,108
Yes, Saket? My dear.

174
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:04,641
How are you, pal?

175
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,378
I am doomed, pal.

176
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,720
Ever since my father's death,
nothing good...

177
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:11,120
...has been happening to me.

178
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:15,216
Listen, there has been an
income tax raid at my boss's house.

179
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:17,186
It could be my turn any time.

180
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:21,126
I am sending my boss's Rs.
5 crores to your house.

181
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,527
Please manage.

182
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,504
5 crores?
- Yes.

183
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,432
Sure. Send it here.

184
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,471
It is your own house.

185
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,239
Take it back when you feel like.

186
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:35,773
I am a bit rushed now.
Speak to you later.

187
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:37,372
Bye.
- See you. Bye.

188
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:41,416
Rakesh, listen to me carefully.

189
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:44,354
Tell me. - Have to invest 5
crores urgently in the market.

190
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:46,551
And I want to double it urgently.

191
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:49,160
Can you do it? - But where
did you get so much money from?

192
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,222
P. Chidambaram has given it to me.

193
00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:53,527
Said its the
governments money. Is lying idle.

194
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,130
Invest in stock market.
The country will benefit.

195
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:57,328
Why are you getting so annoyed?

196
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:58,597
I will invest in Satyam Infotech.

197
00:10:58,671 --> 00:10:59,763
And yes. My
commission will be double.

198
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,137
Take whatever you want.

199
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,607
As if I have to give
it from my pocket.

200
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,406
5 crores.

201
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:11,648
10 crores.

202
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:14,619
Sex.

203
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:16,547
Listen, Nikhil.

204
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:18,112
I want to talk to you about
something really important.

205
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,318
Yes. Same here. But you say first.

206
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:24,227
See, Nikhil, we have known
each other since childhood.

207
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:25,791
We like each other.

208
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:28,390
In fact, we love
each other a lot too.

209
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:31,295
But the progress a
relationship should make...

210
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,566
But I feel something different now.

211
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,472
I think I am done
with relationships.

212
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:39,337
You are getting my point, right?

213
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:41,605
Yes.

214
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:45,648
Look, Anjali, what happens is there
comes a time in everyone's life...

215
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:47,643
...when he gets bored
of the daily routine.

216
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:49,484
Even I want something new.

217
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:52,590
Something more. Something
more exciting. You know.

218
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:57,320
I guess this is what
I wanted to tell you.

219
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,822
We should start a new life.

220
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,159
Correct.

221
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,601
And I have brought you here to
this romantic place so that we...

222
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,331
...end whatever we had
between us and start...

223
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:07,703
...something new.

224
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:11,139
You are right.

225
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:12,436
Let us break up.

226
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:21,713
Dude, why are you sitting
here like the Statue of Liberty?

227
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,213
Hey, Anjali.
- Hi.

228
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:27,122
Nice dress.

229
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:29,721
You were coming here.
You should've told me.

230
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:31,286
We would've come here together.

231
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:34,065
Rajveer. Please.

232
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,296
Go from here.
- Okay.

233
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:38,263
Inconvenience regretted.

234
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,529
Henceforth put the board of
don't disturb on your table.

235
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:42,164
I will take a U turn. Okay.

236
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:45,369
Hey, black forest.
- Rajveer. Please.

237
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,174
Don't eat it.
- I am not eating it.

238
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:48,709
Look, you know very well.
- Rajveer.

239
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:51,249
I start drooling when
I see cherry and cream.

240
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:52,409
Raj... Rajveer.

241
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:00,417
There is a stone in the cake.

242
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:19,437
Excuse me. Come here. Come on.

243
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:23,208
You're actually getting married.

244
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:25,345
Nikhil, are you out of your mind?

245
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:27,716
Rajveer, please just get the
hell out of here. Right now.

246
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:33,292
Okay. Relax. Relax. Relax, folks.

247
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:36,420
I am sorry.

248
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:40,425
Childhood friends.

249
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,231
Anjali, I don't know
what you think about me.

250
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:48,265
I don't know whether you'll be
able to live without me or not.

251
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:50,639
But I won't be able
to live without you.

252
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,206
Will you marry me?

253
00:13:58,784 --> 00:13:59,842
Yes.

254
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:07,552
Finally.

255
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:15,130
Hey... What's up?

256
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:16,730
What is the occasion?

257
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:18,463
Wearing pink today.

258
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:19,664
Hey, brother. How are you?

259
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:21,502
What are the two of you doing here?

260
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:22,768
We have come to mess up your life.

261
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:24,469
Actually, there wasn't
no entry put up outside.

262
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:25,738
So I came in.

263
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:27,370
Yes. Yes.

264
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:30,176
As if the two of you need
invitations to come or go? - No.

265
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,116
Look, boss.
- Anjali is coming here today.

266
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:34,414
With her mother and father.

267
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:35,715
To meet my mother and father.

268
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:38,188
Wow.
- Fantastic.

269
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:41,650
So I don't want my marriage
broken because of the two of you.

270
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,490
So why don't you get the
out of here then?

271
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:47,128
Come on. The door is that way.

272
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,862
Thank you. Nikhil, you know.

273
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:53,163
You should always throw
garbage out of the house.

274
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,431
Throw him out.
- Why should I go?

275
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:57,101
Hi, uncle. - I was always
in favor of your marriage.

276
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:59,269
Look, there will not be
any tension because of me.

277
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:01,079
I can't say anything about the rest.

278
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:03,080
Don't even think.

279
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:04,808
I am not going anywhere.

280
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:06,746
We are your friends. Your family.

281
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:08,719
How will the girl and her
family feel when they come here?

282
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:10,551
None of your friends are here.

283
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,282
Look, this is how it is.

284
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:13,825
You didn't listen to me.
- I didn't.

285
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,459
You have a death wish. Good luck.

286
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:19,020
We will do our
duties as your friends.

287
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:20,524
Peacefully

288
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:23,134
Peacefully. The two of you.

289
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:25,562
Do you know how big
jerks the two of you are?

290
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:32,402
Sorry. I am sorry for
what happened yesterday.

291
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:35,572
But, I swear. We will
be at our best behavior.

292
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:37,275
Look, there won't be any
problem because of us.

293
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,408
Trust me.

294
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,109
Let me see.
- Uncle...

295
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:43,121
Folks. Please. You will
not come out of this room.

296
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,451
Please.
- May we receive them?

297
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:45,820
Please.
- A little help.

298
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:47,420
Please, brother. Please.

299
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,252
Thank you.

300
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,200
Every time. Thanks to you.

301
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,363
Oh my God!

302
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:03,006
Hi.
- How are you, son?

303
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:05,139
How are you, mom?
- Fine, thank you.

304
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,078
Hi, sir.
- How are you, man?

305
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:11,806
Forget it, let's eat it.

306
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,225
You should at least have manners...

307
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:22,056
...that you shouldn't
eat before the guests.

308
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:25,162
So, where should we start from?
- What?

309
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,765
Look, kids need to marry.

310
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,062
You know.

311
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:33,399
And why are you
eating like a beggar?

312
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:38,668
There's a small problem.

313
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:42,111
You know Anjali, her grandma.

314
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,082
She's going to die.
- Oh, God.

315
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:46,584
Dad.
- Excuse me.

316
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:49,280
You are saying that for my mother.

317
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,758
Sorry, mom. Sorry, dear.

318
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,658
Sorry, mother-in-law.

319
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:02,424
This fork and spoon
isn't made to stare at.

320
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,463
They are made for eating. Idiot.

321
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:20,444
This is how you eat?

322
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,087
With a fork and spoon,
without opening your mouth wide...

323
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:24,281
...and without making a sound.

324
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:30,822
Whether I use my hands,
or my mouth to eat...

325
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:33,289
...why does it concern you?

326
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:36,627
What is your problem?

327
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:38,194
Listen, you dog.

328
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,333
Don't badmouth me.

329
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:42,367
Then what should I do, rascal?

330
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,169
Rajveer, shut your mouth or else...

331
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:51,841
Or else what?

332
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:56,713
What will you do?

333
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,120
Hit me.

334
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:00,058
Why the...

335
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:05,052
We have very little time.

336
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:08,492
And I want this marriage to
get over with at jet speed.

337
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,262
You know. Two weeks.

338
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,296
Big resort. Dubai.

339
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:25,751
Take that. Take that.

340
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:31,383
Rajveer, what have you done?

341
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:33,391
You two have ruined the food.

342
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:35,719
Sorry.

343
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:43,796
Rascal.

344
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:45,196
What's going on?

345
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,831
What is happening here?
- What are you boys doing?

346
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:58,283
What the...

347
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:00,107
Oh, no.

348
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,351
I am sorry for this.

349
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,790
They injured my
father's head, Nikhil.

350
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:14,462
You won't invite your
friends to our marriage.

351
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:16,494
And if they attend the marriage...

352
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:18,764
...then I won't go ahead with it.
- What are you saying?

353
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:20,531
They are my best friends.

354
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:22,631
I know they are
slightly mischievous.

355
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,005
They are slightly stupid as well.

356
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:25,373
But that doesn't mean...

357
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,002
...that you will
punish them so severely.

358
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:30,344
It's my marriage.
- Stupid? They are scoundrels.

359
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,146
Nikhil. We only get married once.

360
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,478
And I want our
marriage to be perfect.

361
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:37,313
Listen, baby.

362
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:40,490
Just calm down. I promise you...

363
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,753
...I am going to give you
a perfect wedding, okay.

364
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:45,161
How? Everything's going wrong.

365
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:48,122
My marriage dress isn't ready yet.

366
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:51,235
The designer from whom I
want to stitch my dress...

367
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:54,101
...is busy making a dress for a
famous movie actress's wedding.

368
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:57,370
He completely refused
to make a dress for me.

369
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,735
So what's the problem?

370
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:00,836
Ask some other designer to
make your dress. - No, dear.

371
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,746
No one can make a
dress like Jaiswal.

372
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:05,579
He's just wonderful.

373
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:08,417
And if he doesn't design my dress...

374
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:10,086
...then I won't get married.

375
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:13,251
What? What's the problem?

376
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:15,685
Two minutes ago my
friends were a problem for you.

377
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,524
And now this wedding
dress is coming between us.

378
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:18,688
This is so ridiculous.

379
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:20,664
I don't want to hear anything.
- But what is your problem.

380
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,257
No wedding dress, no marriage.
- But that's...

381
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,460
Invite Aarav, no marriage.

382
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:24,628
This is madness.
- Invite Rajveer, and no marriage.

383
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,398
You have lost your mind.
- That's it. I am done.

384
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:27,798
Okay, I am done too.

385
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:30,433
The witch. Even I
don't want to marry you.

386
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:34,309
Anjali has clearly refused...

387
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,777
...that you two
cannot attend the wedding.

388
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:38,616
And being a henpecked
husband you said yes.

389
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:43,853
Bravo.
- But, I am your wedding planner.

390
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,549
I mean, planning your wedding,
the decorations...

391
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,183
...is my business, friendship aside.

392
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:51,394
So, I think I can come.

393
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:53,356
You cannot come.

394
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:54,857
Sorry.

395
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:59,600
Fine. I am leaving.
- Bye.

396
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:01,532
Okay.
- Yes.

397
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:06,136
You didn't leave.

398
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:09,373
He doesn't even try to stop me.
- Yes.

399
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:11,040
What a filthy man.
- Seriously.

400
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:12,208
Just leave, don't stop.

401
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:13,843
Selfish rascal.

402
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:15,178
You forgot everything, didn't you?

403
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:17,654
In your childhood, when
girls wouldn't even look at you...

404
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:19,384
...that's when I taught
you how to talk to girls.

405
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,255
I taught you to play
Doctor with girls.

406
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,693
I even taught you how
to propose to girls.

407
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,525
I got you your first kiss.

408
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,293
I bought you your first condom.

409
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:28,492
Back then you used to
say Thank you, thank you.

410
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,057
But today I...
- Listen, listen.

411
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:32,535
I remember everything. No
need to remind me, understand.

412
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:34,197
And if you're that good a friend...

413
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:36,704
...then get me that
Jaiswal's wedding dress.

414
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:39,605
Can you two do it?

415
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:49,145
What is this?

416
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:50,879
Aarav, where have you brought us?

417
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:53,251
That Ravi Shankar Jaiswal.
- Yes.

418
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,857
He's coming here to
attend a party function.

419
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:57,187
What are you saying?

420
00:21:57,396 --> 00:21:58,795
That is why we are here.

421
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:00,392
And you please stay quiet.

422
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:03,431
Get lost.
- Look, we have made it until here.

423
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:04,594
Please don't create any problem,
okay. Please.

424
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,535
Surprising. I am helping
you and you are scolding me.

425
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:08,034
He is right.

426
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,041
You want a wedding dress
for Anjali, don't you?

427
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:12,642
We will get it for you.
- Not we, me.

428
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:14,443
And please don't say
anything here...

429
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:16,640
...because only sophisticated,
cultured and well-mannered...

430
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:18,114
...people come to this place.

431
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,045
You mean gay.

432
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:23,718
Not all are gay, some
are sophisticated like me.

433
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:27,156
That means gay. - Ask him to
shut up or I will shut him up.

434
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:29,251
I will keep my mouth shut.

435
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:31,086
And anyway, what is my point
of speaking in such a place.

436
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:32,221
You say it.

437
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:34,357
Here.

438
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:36,492
Come on.
- Wait.

439
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,729
So, mister. What is the problem?

440
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:41,865
You cannot go in until you
don't wear this Superman dress.

441
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:43,597
We want to walk in and not fly.

442
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:45,803
Come on.
- Wear it once...

443
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:47,345
...and then you will
see what flies inside.

444
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:48,471
Get lost.
- He's crazy.

445
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:49,639
Come on, let's go. We'll
meet him some other day.

446
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:52,578
It concerns my marriage.

447
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:54,310
Wear it.

448
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:58,689
Red underwear?
- Pint T-shirt.

449
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,657
It will look nice on us.

450
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:05,622
Sophisticated. Cultured.

451
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:08,228
Well-mannered.

452
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:18,503
This is crazy.

453
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:20,306
Today we had to dress like
Superman for his marriage...

454
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:21,846
...God knows what tomorrow.

455
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:23,173
Do you have a problem?

456
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:24,306
Then go outside.

457
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:26,044
Hey, take him outside.
- Shut up, you two.

458
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:28,177
The underwear's so tight and
you two are uttering nonsense.

459
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:32,515
He was such a...
- I was so fed up, you know.

460
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:34,184
To hell.

461
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:36,693
Excuse me. Where can
I find Mr. Jaiswal?

462
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:38,857
Forget about Jaiswal,
give us tequila shots.

463
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:40,190
Three.
- Yes, get it.

464
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:42,127
Hi, handsome.
- Excuse me.

465
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:45,329
What are you smiling about?
- Handsome.

466
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:46,864
Look.

467
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:52,503
Do not touch.

468
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:54,436
Fly.

469
00:23:58,317 --> 00:23:59,409
What is it?

470
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:02,745
What?
- You ask. - Fly. - Ask.

471
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:08,092
So, Superman. Can we fly?

472
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,091
Of course. Of course.

473
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:14,487
Wherever he goes, he flies there.

474
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:17,592
Look, Super... woman, man. Whatever.

475
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:19,193
I cannot even address him properly.

476
00:24:19,404 --> 00:24:21,599
Look, don't touch me.
Don't misbehave.

477
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:24,437
Stay away. Otherwise I will
kick you so hard on your back...

478
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,205
...that I will turn you
into a super-duper bumper.

479
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:27,336
How dare you?

480
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:29,539
Dudes. Everyone
come here. Come here.

481
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:31,207
Don't think we are weak.

482
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:32,580
Even we can fight.

483
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:34,216
Really?

484
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:35,378
What's your problem?

485
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:37,479
Tell us.
- Just leave.

486
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:39,046
Boss. Boss. Boss.

487
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:40,216
I am requesting you.

488
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:41,691
Please let us meet Mr. Jaiswal.

489
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,251
I want him to make a wedding
dress for my would-be wife.

490
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:46,126
Oh, well. That's not possible.

491
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:47,495
And even if it had been possible...

492
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:49,500
...then we wouldn't have told you.

493
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:50,865
Because your friend sucks.

494
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:52,195
Look, I am requesting you.

495
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:53,431
If he doesn't make
the wedding dress...

496
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:54,597
...then my wedding
will be called off.

497
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:56,135
Okay, we will.

498
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:57,433
But one condition.

499
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:59,101
Let's have a dance competition.

500
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:00,668
Let's see if you all are the best.

501
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:01,804
If you are the best...

502
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,481
...then you have a meeting
with Ravi Shankar Jaiswal.

503
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,814
And if you turn out to
be the worst, then...

504
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:09,486
Then?
- Then.

505
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:11,280
Nobody knows.

506
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:15,792
We are the supermen.

507
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:19,486
We are the supermen.

508
00:25:19,665 --> 00:25:22,828
We are the supermen.

509
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:24,262
And we want to fly.

510
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:27,032
Want to fly, high, high.

511
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,096
High, high, high.

512
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:39,047
We won't abuse you.

513
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:40,675
You don't abuse us.

514
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:44,415
Just let us sit on your lap.

515
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:46,218
We won't abuse you.

516
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,054
You don't abuse us.

517
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:51,584
Just let us sit on your lap.

518
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:58,227
We own the nights,
and also the days.

519
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:03,065
We own the nights,
and also the days.

520
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:04,699
It's an ambience
filled with excitement.

521
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:07,074
We will create a ruckus.

522
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:09,713
We won't abuse you.

523
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:11,510
You don't abuse us.

524
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:15,178
Just let us sit on your lap.

525
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:19,257
We are the supermen.

526
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:22,652
We are the supermen.

527
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:26,425
We are the supermen.

528
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:27,658
And we want to fly.

529
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:30,463
Want to fly, high, high.

530
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:32,469
High, high, high.

531
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:57,729
Live this moment.

532
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:01,227
Don't care a darn...

533
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,165
...no matter how much
the world troubles you.

534
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:05,066
Breathe deeply in my arms.

535
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:08,464
Don't let distances crop up.

536
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:13,273
No matter what the
world says, come on.

537
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:15,108
We won't abuse you.

538
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,738
You don't abuse us.

539
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:20,478
Just let us sit on your lap.

540
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:24,147
Let us sit on your lap
and tell us lullabies.

541
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:26,087
We won't abuse you.

542
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:27,648
You don't abuse us.

543
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:29,591
We won't abuse you.

544
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:32,061
You don't abuse us.

545
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:35,428
We are the supermen.

546
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:39,228
We are the supermen.

547
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:42,499
We are the supermen.

548
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:43,836
And we want to fly.

549
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:46,636
Want to fly, high, high.

550
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:48,612
High, high, high.

551
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:54,046
Superb. Great.
- Please. Please. Go back.

552
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:57,550
Superb. Fantastic. Mind-blowing,
boys.

553
00:27:57,723 --> 00:27:59,281
You rocked my party.

554
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:01,019
My party was getting so boring.
- Who is he?

555
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:03,118
You just set my party on fire.

556
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:05,459
There's fire raging everywhere.

557
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,758
I am so happy.

558
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:08,159
Who is he?

559
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:10,463
He is Ravi Shankar Jaiswal,
you naughty boy.

560
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:13,236
I see.

561
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:17,169
Sorry, we got a
little too carried away.

562
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:18,402
No worries, boys.

563
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:20,672
You're bound to have
such fun at this age.

564
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:23,344
And that's exactly
what we all did as well.

565
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:27,782
Nikhil. Don't worry about
your fiancé's wedding dress.

566
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,351
I am going to do it.

567
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:32,388
And it will be a
wedding dress from my side.

568
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:36,420
Yes.

569
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:38,262
Thank you so much, Aarav.
- Anytime.

570
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,820
Thank you. Thank you so much.

571
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:42,189
I really want you guys to
be a part of my wedding.

572
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,393
Of course.
- Excuse me.

573
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:45,396
Even I helped in getting the dress.

574
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:48,267
I need a hug too.
- I hugged her genuinely.

575
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:49,565
I am doing it genuinely as well.

576
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:50,801
She's your future sister-in-law.

577
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:52,537
Wasn't she yours?
- Of course.

578
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:54,238
Guys, guys.

579
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:58,145
Sneha. Sneha's come, Nikhil.
- Sneha.

580
00:28:58,483 --> 00:28:59,745
Come, let's go.
- Let's go, let's go.

581
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:01,244
Guys, I will see you later.

582
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:04,680
Sneha?

583
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:01,205
What a girl?

584
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,610
Sexy. What a beauty.

585
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:10,547
I am serious.
- I am serious too.

586
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:13,215
By that I meant marriage.

587
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:16,219
Done.

588
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:17,622
Once I get over with the honeymoon...

589
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:18,856
...then you can marry her. Okay.

590
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:22,763
Who do you think you are?

591
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:25,262
I will win over this girl.

592
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,362
By hook or by crook.

593
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:29,335
Place a bet if you want.

594
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:36,473
Coward.

595
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:37,640
Done.

596
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,778
Good luck. Bro.

597
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:52,227
Good luck, bro.

598
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:54,562
We are meeting after a year.

599
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:56,623
I missed you so much.

600
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,498
You know what, I also missed you.

601
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:04,334
Forget that. You say
that you missed me.

602
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:07,271
But you completely forgot
me after going to the US.

603
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:09,145
Two doors in the same bathroom.
- Oh, no.

604
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:10,272
Were you too busy?

605
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:11,610
Thank God I came here
only to wash my hands.

606
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,579
What did you get so many gifts for?

607
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:14,744
This is for you...

608
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:17,521
...and... Nikhil.

609
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,623
Hello. We aren't married yet.

610
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:23,160
If I forget then later you will
say that I didn't give a gift.

611
00:31:23,228 --> 00:31:24,388
Where is your boyfriend?

612
00:31:24,462 --> 00:31:25,554
He was supposed to come
with you, wasn't he?

613
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:27,257
He didn't come.
- Why?

614
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,132
Break up.
- What?

615
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:32,603
Oh my, God. You broke up
with him as well? - Yes.

616
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:35,469
Is there a big importance
of break up in your life?

617
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,369
First you advised me on the phone...

618
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:38,704
...and you broke up yourself.

619
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:40,540
You know what, babe.
It's not like that.

620
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,304
We hadn't even dated for six days...

621
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:45,480
...when he proposed
to me for marriage.

622
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:47,175
I was like Are you mad.

623
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:48,811
You should have seen him.

624
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:50,616
Side-parting, oily hair.

625
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:53,157
Always suited-booted.
No style, nothing.

626
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:55,387
He would talk so mannerly...

627
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,291
...it seemed like he was misbehaving.

628
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:59,089
No abusing, or foul-mouthing.

629
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,155
Dude, I am your girlfriend.

630
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,224
Why are you being so formal?

631
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:05,326
That was fine.

632
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:06,529
I would have managed.

633
00:32:07,105 --> 00:32:08,732
But...
- But what?

634
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:13,107
No party, no flirting,
no fun, no kissing, no...

635
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:20,546
I was like, Look, better
get lost. - Wow, great.

636
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:21,745
Great thoughts, madam.

637
00:32:22,153 --> 00:32:24,678
Listen, if its true love...

638
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:27,591
...then you should get married.
Understand.

639
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:30,192
I believe in love. I
want to get married.

640
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:31,855
But not like this.

641
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,195
Let me enjoy life first.

642
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,346
You are a...

643
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:33,843
You?

644
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,483
You haven't left yet.
- No.

645
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:41,155
I...
- What?

646
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:45,389
Get it.
- What?

647
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:48,591
Get me that girl, please.

648
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,665
What? You think I am a pimp.

649
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:54,432
Then be one. How does it matter?

650
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:55,800
Can't you do this
much for your friend?

651
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:58,766
Look. She is Anjali's best friend.

652
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:00,571
She is like a sister.

653
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:02,272
But she isn't her sister, is she?

654
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:04,239
And I am not her brother either.

655
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:07,148
Look. She is not your type of girl...

656
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:08,344
...and neither are you her type.

657
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,445
She likes well-cultured,
well-mannered boys. - Nonsense.

658
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:12,456
Understand. - And anyway,
I don't want you to pull...

659
00:35:12,524 --> 00:35:14,014
...such tricks in my marriage.

660
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:16,788
Forget that girl, forget
this house, and get going.

661
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:22,293
A small introduction.

662
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,726
Small. I will
handle the rest. Please.

663
00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:26,495
Intro.
- You can do that.

664
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:28,703
Come on.
- Thank you.

665
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:30,365
Listen. Just say good things.

666
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:31,500
Yes. I will tell her
about all your good things.

667
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:33,544
I will tell her how many girls
you made pregnant. How many...

668
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:35,272
...you have seduced. And how many
illegitimate children you have.

669
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:36,438
Enough.
- I will tell her everything.

670
00:35:37,048 --> 00:35:39,676
I asked you to say good
things and not be honest.

671
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:45,316
You are going to
rape me in front of her.

672
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,482
Otherwise you will do her.

673
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:49,318
Look, she's a nice and sweet girl.

674
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:50,588
She needs a simple and sober guy.

675
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:52,357
Not someone like you. Understand.

676
00:35:57,402 --> 00:35:59,199
Simple and sober.

677
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:02,132
How is that possible?

678
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:09,577
Let my heart keep singing.
- No, no, no.

679
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:12,207
Dev sir is too evergreen for me.

680
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:15,116
Hello. I don't know
anything about other things...

681
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:16,619
...except for my own subject.
- Amol sir.

682
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:19,020
He's too simple.

683
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:21,149
Allow me to leave.
- Simple.

684
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:23,354
Dharampur, Dharampur, Dharampur.
- Oh, God.

685
00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:25,293
Mangalore, Bangalore,
Mangalore, Bangalore. - Ashok Kumar.

686
00:36:25,363 --> 00:36:28,491
Mandva, Khandva.
- It will take my entire lifetime.

687
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:30,124
Talegaon. Malegaon.
- Not that long.

688
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:32,198
'You should at least know that... '

689
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,067
'... you shouldn't eat
before the guests.'

690
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,368
No way.

691
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:40,305
I will rather die but...

692
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:44,038
But... Come back.

693
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:46,675
'This fork and spoon
isn't made to stare at.'

694
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:49,049
'They are made for eating.' - Now,
he will make my plan successful.

695
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:53,216
Simple... and sober.

696
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:00,689
Oh, my.

697
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:02,528
He will ask for money.

698
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,204
Good afternoon.

699
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,338
Hello.

700
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:21,708
What is this? Your friends always
come on time and ruin everything.

701
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,078
Today, by not coming on time...

702
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:24,553
...are they planning
to ruin our wedding?

703
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:26,385
You should be happy.

704
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:27,783
Pray that they don't come.

705
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,750
We will at least be
able to get married.

706
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:31,456
Hey, Sex.
- Hi.

707
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,510
Would you be my baby?

708
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,524
You?
- Yes, me.

709
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:04,487
What is this, boss?

710
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:07,364
Why is your hair standing?
Did you come on a bike?

711
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,396
Whose clothes have you worn?

712
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,157
Style, Sex.

713
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:13,135
That's called style.

714
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:14,296
Style?

715
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:16,634
Okay. Where's the other joker?

716
00:38:38,363 --> 00:38:39,455
Hi, friends.

717
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:41,123
Oh no.

718
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:45,399
Why are you guys staring at me?

719
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,762
Didn't you recognize me?

720
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:49,396
I am your dear friend Rajveer.

721
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,300
You... you...

722
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:53,207
Why has your hair
gone flat? What is this?

723
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:55,040
Well...
- Hey, Sunny.

724
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:57,046
Sunny.
- You... you...

725
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:58,207
Come here.
- Take care.

726
00:38:58,282 --> 00:38:59,579
Come. Come. Come.
- You take care.

727
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:02,484
'He is copying my
style to woo Sneha.'

728
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,746
Poor guy.

729
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:06,986
'He doesn't know that Sneha
doesn't want a simpleton... '

730
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:09,389
'... but someone who is debauchee.'

731
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:12,621
Off.

732
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:27,703
Hey, hot-bun.

733
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,576
Aarav. Nikhil's the best friend.

734
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,177
Yeah.
- Sneha. Nice to meet you.

735
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:35,583
We have just introduced ourselves.

736
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:38,085
We haven't met.

737
00:39:38,256 --> 00:39:39,382
Too fast.

738
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:40,651
And furious.

739
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:42,522
Curious. Serious.

740
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,818
About you.

741
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:48,391
You are so funny, man.
- Cool.

742
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:50,195
I apologize but if you
brother and sister...

743
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:52,202
...are done with your display of
affection then can I go inside?

744
00:39:53,571 --> 00:39:55,732
No. You cannot.

745
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:57,597
You are very rude.

746
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:58,767
I'll have to do something.

747
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,472
My foot.
- Ouch.

748
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:02,638
Sit properly.
- I'm sorry.

749
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:04,506
Sorry.

750
00:40:05,149 --> 00:40:06,446
I hope you didn't get hurt.

751
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:07,677
No, it's okay.

752
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:11,246
My name is Rajveer.

753
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:12,380
Hi. Sneha.

754
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:14,183
It's a pleasure to meet you.

755
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,322
Same here.
- But I don't feel so.

756
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:19,757
Look, you... We both are
talking to each other.

757
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:21,093
Yes.

758
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:24,800
I request you not to
interfere while we are talking.

759
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:26,866
You... Condoms? What?
- Disgusting.

760
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:28,197
Aarav.
- He is so foul-mouthed.

761
00:40:28,272 --> 00:40:29,603
What is he saying?
- Stop it.

762
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,402
What?
- It's okay.

763
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:34,702
You are going to Dubai?

764
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:35,871
Yes.
- No.

765
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,440
She is going to London.

766
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:40,073
I am going to America. And
the flight we are catching...

767
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:41,675
...is going to West Indies.
Why don't you meet a doctor?

768
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:42,845
Aarav. - You have a
problem of talking too much.

769
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:44,452
Oh really? - What are you doing?
Why are you troubling...

770
00:40:44,522 --> 00:40:46,422
...this poor soul? Keep quiet.
One second. - Tell him.

771
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,584
Yes. I am going to Dubai.

772
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:50,820
Actually, I am going to
attend Anjali's wedding.

773
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:52,287
I am her very good friend.

774
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:54,231
You too are Anjali's friend?

775
00:40:54,465 --> 00:40:55,557
Well... no.

776
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:57,559
I am...

777
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,098
Nikhil's friend.

778
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:01,330
One of.
- Wow.

779
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:03,199
Then we will have a lot
of fun in the wedding.

780
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:04,536
Oh yeah. We will have a lot of fun.

781
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:06,474
Yeah.
- You, me and...

782
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:08,703
There are flowers
blooming everywhere.

783
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,839
Okay, guys. It's
time for the flight.

784
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:12,481
See you.
- Yeah. See you soon. - Bye. - Bye.

785
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,215
I won't spare you. You
are messing with me?

786
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:18,380
I won't spare you, you scoundrel.

787
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:42,211
Aarav has really done a great
job with the wedding arrangements.

788
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:44,606
Beautiful.

789
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:46,275
Really.

790
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,113
Ladies and gentlemen.

791
00:41:48,252 --> 00:41:50,243
May I have your attention, please?

792
00:41:50,321 --> 00:41:52,084
Here he comes.
- Please.

793
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:54,284
Listen, everybody.

794
00:41:54,458 --> 00:42:00,294
Today, my daughter Anjali
and Nikhil are getting engaged.

795
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:08,697
Whenever I see my daughter
only one thought comes to my mind.

796
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:12,643
My daughter, she is
brave like her father.

797
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:19,442
And whenever I see Nikhil I feel...

798
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:28,347
That he is very simple
and sober, like his father.

799
00:42:30,661 --> 00:42:31,787
Right?

800
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,322
Uncle.

801
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:36,700
I can say just one thing
when I look at Anjali.

802
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,257
True and loyal friend.

803
00:42:38,502 --> 00:42:40,834
And Nikhil, cool and handsome.

804
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:44,566
I want to say something.

805
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:46,269
I want to say something.
I want to say something.

806
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:47,470
Excuse me, please.
- Sure.

807
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:49,376
Thank you.
- Thank you.

808
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:51,779
Nikhil, my friend, my buddy.

809
00:42:52,383 --> 00:42:53,509
He is brave.

810
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:56,184
Like father like son.

811
00:42:57,455 --> 00:43:01,050
Yeah. Yeah. - And after
marriage he will be a tamed pet.

812
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,251
Meow.

813
00:43:03,694 --> 00:43:04,752
Right, Sneha?

814
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:06,091
Isn't it funny?

815
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:08,256
Yeah?

816
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:10,594
And Anjali? Oh,
the beautiful Anjali.

817
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:13,335
Sexy mother's sexy daughter.

818
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:15,095
I want to eat you, baby.

819
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:21,503
Yeah.

820
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,070
She is going to be his ringmaster.

821
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:25,775
The one in command.

822
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:29,344
When she will express her love...

823
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,251
...it will look as
if she is growling.

824
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:32,482
Where had you gone?
Why did you go there?

825
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:34,421
With whom did you go? How
much money did you spend?

826
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:38,156
Isn't it? Isn't it, Sneha?

827
00:43:39,063 --> 00:43:40,325
Oh yeah. Yeah.

828
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:44,764
We all told him not to get married.
This is a trap.

829
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:46,097
You will get trapped. You will
get trapped. You will get trapped.

830
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,695
But he paid no heed. Now look,
this fool got trapped.

831
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,500
Now no matter what you do.

832
00:43:50,574 --> 00:43:53,566
No matter how much cajoling you do,
you will have to face the whip.

833
00:43:57,214 --> 00:43:58,306
Isn't it, Sneha?

834
00:44:02,153 --> 00:44:04,178
What happened? Why are
all of you so quiet?

835
00:44:04,522 --> 00:44:06,183
Did you like it so much?

836
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:09,818
Thank you.

837
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:11,352
What is this?

838
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:12,621
I too want to say something.

839
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:16,596
Rajveer. One is enough.

840
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,100
Will you too...

841
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:21,696
Well, I feel long
speeches are very boring.

842
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:23,797
Hence I want to say just two words.

843
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:28,771
Husband and wife are like
the two wheels of a chariot.

844
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,745
The chariot cannot move
even if one wheel breaks.

845
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:37,081
But I know that my
friend Nikhil and Anjali's...

846
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:38,416
...relation will never break.

847
00:44:40,424 --> 00:44:43,655
Because their
relationship is very pure.

848
00:44:44,595 --> 00:44:46,495
Very clean. Very true.

849
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:50,265
Wow.
- If he is sour, she is sweet.

850
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,462
If he is the sky,
then she is the land.

851
00:44:54,872 --> 00:44:56,396
If he is happiness,
then she is sadness.

852
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,800
If he is the sun, she is the moon.

853
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,503
If he is fire, she is a
fire cracker, sorry, water.

854
00:45:03,247 --> 00:45:05,010
Though they are
different from each other...

855
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:08,282
...but they are
incomplete without each other.

856
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,120
That's it. This is
all I have to say.

857
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,687
Wow.
- Wow.

858
00:45:13,758 --> 00:45:15,055
Cool.

859
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,022
Whatever he said was nice.

860
00:45:17,094 --> 00:45:18,254
I didn't understand what he said.

861
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:20,126
But his Hindi is very nice.

862
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:21,729
Thank you. Thank you.

863
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,192
Beautiful.
- Please.

864
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:26,163
I said whatever came
to my heart. That's it.

865
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:32,534
These were your two words?

866
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:34,702
No matter how many they were...

867
00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:36,041
...they were better than yours.

868
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:39,039
I couldn't
understand whether you were...

869
00:45:39,116 --> 00:45:40,208
...uniting or separating them.

870
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:41,779
You know what?

871
00:46:10,648 --> 00:46:13,310
You are my life, dear.

872
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:16,179
I've given my heart to you, dear.

873
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:19,085
You are my life, dear.

874
00:46:19,156 --> 00:46:21,590
I've given my heart to you, dear.

875
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:24,455
You make the world smile.

876
00:46:24,595 --> 00:46:27,291
Happiness lies in you.

877
00:46:27,431 --> 00:46:32,334
Whatever you say
calms my heart down.

878
00:46:32,403 --> 00:46:35,099
I keep chanting your name.

879
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:37,732
I keep you close to my heart.

880
00:46:37,808 --> 00:46:43,337
I stop breathing
when I think of you.

881
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:46,212
I keep chanting your name.

882
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:48,843
I keep you close to my heart.

883
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:54,683
I stop breathing
when I think of you.

884
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:11,505
My thoughts stay occupied by you.

885
00:47:11,742 --> 00:47:17,237
My desire has brought
me close to your desire.

886
00:47:28,425 --> 00:47:33,692
My thoughts stay occupied by you.

887
00:47:34,098 --> 00:47:39,297
My desire has brought
me close to your desire.

888
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,702
I keep chanting your name.

889
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:44,468
I keep you close to my heart.

890
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:50,174
I stop breathing
when I think of you.

891
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:32,155
By keeping you in my eyes,
I come back from death.

892
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:39,161
I will be happy to
give my life for you.

893
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:54,306
By keeping you in my eyes,
I come back from death.

894
00:48:54,511 --> 00:48:59,744
I will be happy to
give my life for you.

895
00:48:59,817 --> 00:49:02,217
I keep chanting your name.

896
00:49:02,286 --> 00:49:05,016
I keep you close to my heart.

897
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:10,550
I stop breathing
when I think of you.

898
00:49:10,628 --> 00:49:13,290
I keep chanting your name.

899
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:16,094
I keep you close to my heart.

900
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:21,798
I stop breathing
when I think of you.

901
00:49:34,385 --> 00:49:35,477
Two minutes. Two minutes.

902
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:38,113
Where are you taking me?

903
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:39,481
Two minutes.

904
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:41,557
Now slowly open your eyes.

905
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:42,683
Okay?
- Okay.

906
00:49:43,494 --> 00:49:44,688
Slowly.

907
00:49:52,403 --> 00:49:54,030
How beautiful.

908
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:55,571
You like it?
- Yeah.

909
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,636
You made it?
- Yeah.

910
00:49:58,242 --> 00:49:59,334
18 ½ hours.

911
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:01,202
For me?

912
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,445
Is there anyone else here?

913
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:08,107
And yes, forget the waves,
nothing can destroy it.

914
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:11,044
Oh no. Come. Come. Come.

915
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:15,487
Oh no. Did it have to rain now?
- Oh, God.

916
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,789
How did it start raining
all of a sudden? - I know.

917
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:21,160
But, how romantic.
- What timing. Right?

918
00:50:30,074 --> 00:50:33,339
Well, like in the old movies...

919
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:35,537
The hero and heroine are walking...

920
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:37,409
...and all of a
sudden it starts raining.

921
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:39,307
There is lightening and...

922
00:50:39,883 --> 00:50:41,817
And the heroine runs towards the
hero and gives him a tight hug.

923
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,553
And then they both realise, Oh,
God. What did we do?

924
00:50:47,624 --> 00:50:52,323
And then, both of them lose
themselves into each other's eyes.

925
00:50:52,396 --> 00:50:53,488
Like this.

926
00:50:56,533 --> 00:51:00,333
And then their lips inch closer.

927
00:51:01,305 --> 00:51:03,398
And when the hero is
about to his the heroine...

928
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:04,736
...she runs away.

929
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:06,167
Like this.

930
00:51:21,158 --> 00:51:22,352
What timing, God.

931
00:52:16,613 --> 00:52:20,310
One dirham is equal to Rs.12.50.

932
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:24,317
Yes, boss.
- Rs. 12.50.

933
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:28,287
I have earned it for my family.

934
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:29,517
Sorry, boss.

935
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:32,387
Not to build your body.

936
00:52:32,696 --> 00:52:33,788
Sorry, boss.

937
00:52:35,399 --> 00:52:36,525
Scoundrel.

938
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:48,870
Sneha.

939
00:52:49,112 --> 00:52:50,170
Please wait.

940
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:51,642
Where are you going?

941
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:53,307
Sneha.

942
00:52:53,383 --> 00:52:54,680
Tell me something, Rajveer.

943
00:52:54,852 --> 00:52:56,877
Why are you and Aarav after me?

944
00:52:57,287 --> 00:52:58,720
Don't you have a girlfriend?

945
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:00,413
I do.

946
00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:02,517
Who?

947
00:53:08,565 --> 00:53:09,657
Me?

948
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,492
Hey.

949
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:14,600
Who is with me other
than you in this dark night?

950
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:16,497
No one.

951
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:18,675
So you are mine, right?

952
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:24,403
Okay. So what can you do for me,
that is your girlfriend?

953
00:53:27,184 --> 00:53:28,776
Do... do...

954
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:31,349
Do... do...

955
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:33,347
Do...

956
00:53:33,524 --> 00:53:34,616
What is this?

957
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,452
Do...

958
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:39,220
A rhythm.

959
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:42,191
Do, do, do, do. A rhythm.

960
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:43,663
Okay.
- Do, do, do, do.

961
00:53:47,604 --> 00:53:48,696
Sing along.

962
00:53:54,478 --> 00:53:57,242
It's nice, but sing it in tune.

963
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:02,510
Why are you singing like crazy...

964
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:04,349
I mean how are you singing?

965
00:54:05,389 --> 00:54:08,620
In this way, we
will never be in tune.

966
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:10,057
That is what I am trying to say.

967
00:54:10,127 --> 00:54:11,651
If you sing like this,
how will we be in tune?

968
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:15,423
Look, please, make an attempt.

969
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:18,533
Otherwise, how will there be love?

970
00:54:20,737 --> 00:54:21,829
Okay.

971
00:54:22,072 --> 00:54:23,130
Okay then.

972
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,632
I will sing for you.

973
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:28,110
You help me with the rhythm.
- Okay.

974
00:54:29,313 --> 00:54:30,405
Here we go.

975
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:33,741
You, me and this night.

976
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:38,118
It's something very simple.

977
00:54:43,627 --> 00:54:46,653
The sky is sad.

978
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:50,461
Because the moon is with me.

979
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:58,841
You, me and this night.

980
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:02,068
It's something very simple.

981
00:55:02,379 --> 00:55:05,075
The sky is sad.

982
00:55:05,148 --> 00:55:08,549
Because the moon is with me.

983
00:55:18,362 --> 00:55:22,093
My heart tells me...

984
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:24,531
I should commit a mistake.

985
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:28,262
If you touch me...

986
00:55:28,438 --> 00:55:32,465
I will be fragrant.

987
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:44,585
You, me and this night.

988
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:02,698
You are a nice person.

989
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:06,265
But you hold a secret.

990
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:16,016
In this wet night...

991
00:56:16,086 --> 00:56:19,385
I fear getting influenced by you.

992
00:56:25,462 --> 00:56:29,193
You are a nice person.

993
00:56:29,266 --> 00:56:32,633
But you hold a secret.

994
00:56:32,703 --> 00:56:35,695
In this wet night...

995
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:39,299
I fear getting influenced by you.

996
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:50,382
You, me and this night.

997
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:56,654
We've been thinking for so long...

998
00:56:56,827 --> 00:56:58,454
...that what would be
the seven conditions...

999
00:56:58,862 --> 00:57:01,160
...that will decide
whether you are men yet or not.

1000
00:57:01,465 --> 00:57:02,557
What do you mean?

1001
00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:06,363
Do you see that shop?
- Which one?

1002
00:57:06,436 --> 00:57:08,301
The toy shop.
- Will you ever grow up?

1003
00:57:08,371 --> 00:57:09,736
Look besides the toy shop,
the lingerie shop.

1004
00:57:10,574 --> 00:57:11,666
Yes, so.

1005
00:57:11,808 --> 00:57:14,106
Go in there, wear a bra,
take a photo and show it to us.

1006
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:15,474
Go on.
- Have you lost your mind?

1007
00:57:15,545 --> 00:57:17,035
I... I will wear a bra?

1008
00:57:17,114 --> 00:57:18,274
What will I say? I want a bra.

1009
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:19,744
You have lost your mind.

1010
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,342
You forgot about the
seven conditions, right?

1011
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:22,778
This is one of the seven.

1012
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,145
Now you can go dance,
sing, do whatever you want.

1013
00:57:25,222 --> 00:57:26,314
Are you serious?
- Go on.

1014
00:57:26,389 --> 00:57:27,447
Go on.
- Have you lost your mind?

1015
00:57:27,824 --> 00:57:29,291
You will get me killed some day.

1016
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:05,519
What the...

1017
00:58:37,527 --> 00:58:39,620
Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?
- No.

1018
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:40,754
No, no, thanks.

1019
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:42,196
I am just checking out something.

1020
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:44,691
Oh no. Oh no.

1021
00:58:54,477 --> 00:58:56,172
You.
- Dad.

1022
00:58:56,246 --> 00:58:59,306
What are you doing here?
- I... I...

1023
00:58:59,382 --> 00:59:00,440
I came to see the trial room.

1024
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,378
You came to see a
lingerie trial room?

1025
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:06,786
What are you doing here? - I
want to see your original colours.

1026
00:59:07,023 --> 00:59:10,288
I want to see the type of
guy my daughter is marrying.

1027
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:11,653
Open your shirt.

1028
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:14,624
We may have a situation.

1029
00:59:14,698 --> 00:59:16,063
Are you serious?

1030
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:18,225
Stop.

1031
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:19,698
Look at him.

1032
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:23,300
Guards. Catch him.

1033
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:25,700
Shut up, guys.

1034
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:29,136
He's gay.

1035
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:36,484
Stop. Stop, guys. Stop.

1036
00:59:48,598 --> 00:59:49,656
Yes, where are you?

1037
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,664
Everyone's looking for you.
- Mr. Rajveer.

1038
00:59:51,835 --> 00:59:53,302
If you want to meet
your friend again...

1039
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:56,271
...come to Hotel
Fairmont room no. 4221 now.

1040
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,632
But who...

1041
01:00:12,722 --> 01:00:13,814
Hey, so there you are.

1042
01:00:15,592 --> 01:00:17,355
By God, you're looking sexy.

1043
01:00:20,096 --> 01:00:21,188
And...

1044
01:00:22,665 --> 01:00:24,758
...who are they?
Hey, dude, what's up?

1045
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:29,034
Do you chew tobacco?

1046
01:00:30,073 --> 01:00:31,131
Sorry.

1047
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:36,304
Buses, shops,
houses. Stairs and trains.

1048
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,041
On walls, do you spit red colour?

1049
01:00:41,284 --> 01:00:44,253
Excuse, are you... talking to me.

1050
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:49,180
Everywhere in India
wherever you see the colour red...

1051
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:51,492
...its because of me.

1052
01:00:52,162 --> 01:00:53,356
Except for the Red Fort.

1053
01:00:54,631 --> 01:00:58,829
Now even ladies spit red colour.

1054
01:01:00,136 --> 01:01:04,197
Later they suffer... from
paralysis of the face.

1055
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:08,806
I gave people this style.

1056
01:01:09,646 --> 01:01:10,772
Only for Rs. 2.

1057
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:14,682
Pay Rs. 2 and take this style.

1058
01:01:17,353 --> 01:01:19,253
What nonsense is he blabbering?

1059
01:01:20,657 --> 01:01:21,783
Who is he?

1060
01:01:25,095 --> 01:01:27,757
Out of all the people that
die due to cancer in India...

1061
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:30,163
...half of them is caused
due to chewing my tobacco.

1062
01:01:30,533 --> 01:01:31,625
So?

1063
01:01:32,836 --> 01:01:35,134
So, you have taken my money.

1064
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,573
Now think what will happen to you.

1065
01:01:47,317 --> 01:01:48,750
Your friend Saket.

1066
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:52,418
His father's dead.

1067
01:01:53,857 --> 01:01:55,449
Saket will die too.

1068
01:01:57,827 --> 01:02:01,228
I fed him so much tobacco that...

1069
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:05,428
...there's red colour left in his
body, but only of the tobacco.

1070
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,605
My eight crores.

1071
01:02:13,443 --> 01:02:17,311
Will you return it after
chewing the tobacco or before?

1072
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:20,608
Not you.

1073
01:02:22,385 --> 01:02:23,716
I will make him chew him.

1074
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:31,324
You said that you will
make ten out of five. Double.

1075
01:02:33,696 --> 01:02:35,163
I am only asking for eight.

1076
01:02:35,698 --> 01:02:37,563
Two crores will be your brokerage.

1077
01:02:38,434 --> 01:02:40,527
Fine, happy.

1078
01:02:42,172 --> 01:02:44,470
You mean we made profit.

1079
01:02:45,308 --> 01:02:46,400
We made profit.

1080
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:49,701
Then you will have to thank me.

1081
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:51,239
I made profit for you, dude.

1082
01:03:11,601 --> 01:03:16,129
You invested my five crores,
understand.

1083
01:03:18,608 --> 01:03:20,599
And I didn't even
get five lakhs from it.

1084
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:22,771
Not even five lakhs.

1085
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:26,476
Look, uncle. I took your money.

1086
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:30,011
Why have you kidnapped him?

1087
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:35,587
If I kidnap you then
who will pay me my money?

1088
01:03:37,193 --> 01:03:40,594
I apologise for whatever happened.

1089
01:03:40,763 --> 01:03:42,162
Please.

1090
01:03:43,233 --> 01:03:44,427
Don't apologise to me.

1091
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,434
Apologise to him, your friend.

1092
01:03:46,603 --> 01:03:49,436
It's not his mistake, uncle.

1093
01:03:50,707 --> 01:03:51,799
Let him go.

1094
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:53,574
He's getting
married after seven days.

1095
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:55,437
He won't.

1096
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:05,418
Pay me my money within seven days.

1097
01:04:06,055 --> 01:04:07,386
And if I don't get the money...

1098
01:04:07,457 --> 01:04:10,358
...then I don't care whether
your friend lives or dies.

1099
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:14,155
And you can contact anyone you want.

1100
01:04:15,064 --> 01:04:20,297
Any goons, don, police,
minister, etcetera, etcetera.

1101
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:21,598
Anyone, anyone.

1102
01:04:23,439 --> 01:04:28,604
No one can get this
marriage done, if I don't want to.

1103
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:46,754
Sorry.

1104
01:04:55,071 --> 01:04:57,403
Beg, borrow, steal, rob a bank.

1105
01:04:57,807 --> 01:05:00,173
Do whatever you want.
But return him his money.

1106
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:02,973
I have a suggestion.

1107
01:05:03,146 --> 01:05:04,204
Tell your father-in-law.

1108
01:05:05,114 --> 01:05:06,206
Tell him I want dowry.

1109
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:13,653
Why do I feel that
Nikhil just slapped you?

1110
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:15,321
You did, didn't you, Nikhil?

1111
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:16,449
Yes, he did.
- Yes.

1112
01:05:16,526 --> 01:05:17,618
Do you want as well? Come on.

1113
01:05:18,061 --> 01:05:19,221
Here you go.
- Hey.

1114
01:05:19,462 --> 01:05:20,588
You asked for it and I did.

1115
01:05:20,663 --> 01:05:23,029
I won't get such an
opportunity again. - Stop dancing.

1116
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:24,657
Do you know what he has done?
- What could he have done?

1117
01:05:24,734 --> 01:05:26,065
He must have
misbehaved with some girl.

1118
01:05:26,302 --> 01:05:28,133
What else can he do?

1119
01:05:28,671 --> 01:05:30,764
Changing the look
doesn't change the person.

1120
01:05:31,574 --> 01:05:34,168
You are a lowly man
and you will stay one.

1121
01:05:34,243 --> 01:05:35,369
And that's why Sneha will...

1122
01:05:35,778 --> 01:05:39,043
Will marry me.

1123
01:05:39,115 --> 01:05:41,606
Will marry me.

1124
01:05:41,684 --> 01:05:44,448
This is nothing. He has
created a bigger mess.

1125
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,680
No. No. No.

1126
01:05:45,755 --> 01:05:47,017
Wait.
- Found it.

1127
01:05:47,323 --> 01:05:48,415
Beat me more.

1128
01:05:48,691 --> 01:05:50,215
Found it.
- What did you find?

1129
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:52,352
Why are you laughing?
- Do you want to hit? Come on. Hit.

1130
01:05:52,428 --> 01:05:53,656
No. Beat me. Beat me.

1131
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,027
It's okay.

1132
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:57,029
Found it.
- Have you gone crazy?

1133
01:05:57,467 --> 01:05:59,196
What did you find?
- Found it.

1134
01:05:59,469 --> 01:06:00,527
He has gone crazy.

1135
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:02,402
Found it.

1136
01:06:02,472 --> 01:06:04,269
Rajveer, leave.
Rajveer, what are you doing?

1137
01:06:09,412 --> 01:06:11,607
What are you doing, Rajveer?
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1138
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:14,046
Sorry.
- Have you gone insane?

1139
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:16,481
Aarav was beating you badly.

1140
01:06:17,019 --> 01:06:18,281
And you were laughing crazily.

1141
01:06:18,788 --> 01:06:20,050
Did you get a fit of laughing?

1142
01:06:20,123 --> 01:06:21,385
That's the game, boss.

1143
01:06:22,392 --> 01:06:23,484
Today, he slapped me.

1144
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:28,519
But when I will beat him,
he won't even realize it.

1145
01:06:28,598 --> 01:06:30,361
Beat? Whom?

1146
01:06:30,633 --> 01:06:32,362
What are you saying? I
don't understand anything.

1147
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:35,302
Look, we want eight crores.

1148
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:39,108
Aarav has 10-12 crores.

1149
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:40,467
Ask me how.

1150
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:43,177
How?
- Reliance shares.

1151
01:06:45,448 --> 01:06:47,382
No matter how down the market is.

1152
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,814
If we sell Reliance shares, we
will get at least 10-12 crores.

1153
01:06:51,254 --> 01:06:53,188
I will throw eight
crores on Gutka's face.

1154
01:06:53,423 --> 01:06:54,822
And we will keep four
crores for ourselves.

1155
01:06:55,258 --> 01:06:58,318
Aarav should just sign
the contract.

1156
01:06:58,528 --> 01:07:00,223
Amazing! Let's talk to him.

1157
01:07:00,296 --> 01:07:01,661
He is our friend. He
will help us. Come on.

1158
01:07:01,731 --> 01:07:03,995
Are you mad? Are
you crazy? Sit here.

1159
01:07:04,367 --> 01:07:05,459
What will you go and say?

1160
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:06,727
Sign for Rajveer.

1161
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:08,766
Hearing my name he
will get so infuriated...

1162
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:10,199
...that his body will
tremble with rage.

1163
01:07:10,273 --> 01:07:11,331
He won't get infuriated.
Talk to him.

1164
01:07:11,407 --> 01:07:13,671
He won't even look at the contract,
leave alone sign it.

1165
01:07:14,377 --> 01:07:15,776
Do one thing.
Leave everything to me.

1166
01:07:16,012 --> 01:07:17,104
Just trust me.

1167
01:07:17,447 --> 01:07:21,508
Somehow convince
Aarav to get married.

1168
01:07:21,584 --> 01:07:22,676
Married?

1169
01:07:22,752 --> 01:07:24,652
Since childhood he
couldn't entice a girl.

1170
01:07:24,787 --> 01:07:26,379
From where will you
bring a bride for him?

1171
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:28,390
Look, listen to me.
Don't use your brains.

1172
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:29,584
Please. Just trust me.

1173
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:31,754
He will get married.

1174
01:07:32,195 --> 01:07:35,995
And we will get our freedom.

1175
01:07:39,235 --> 01:07:40,327
Not red and yellow.

1176
01:07:40,403 --> 01:07:42,234
I want those
beautiful white curtains.

1177
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:43,397
You know, those white curtains...

1178
01:07:43,473 --> 01:07:45,270
...with orchid
flowers on it. Beautiful.

1179
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:46,501
The same thing that we did
during Shilpa's wedding.

1180
01:07:46,576 --> 01:07:48,407
It will be done. Where
should I put the candles?

1181
01:07:49,078 --> 01:07:51,342
Where? Put it on some table.

1182
01:07:51,781 --> 01:07:53,043
Fine. I will do that.

1183
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:54,707
Everybody is talking like Rajveer.

1184
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:56,209
Sir, the fitting is fine?

1185
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:57,547
It's not too tight, is it?

1186
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,212
It's not tight. Come on.

1187
01:07:59,822 --> 01:08:01,153
The marriage should take place.
It will be more than enough.

1188
01:08:02,024 --> 01:08:03,286
Ranjeet.
- Yes, sir.

1189
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,452
After sir's fitting
take my measurements too.

1190
01:08:05,528 --> 01:08:06,620
Fine, sir.

1191
01:08:07,129 --> 01:08:08,255
Aarav.
- Yes.

1192
01:08:08,331 --> 01:08:10,322
Listen, are you serious about Sneha?

1193
01:08:11,133 --> 01:08:12,225
Dead serious.

1194
01:08:12,502 --> 01:08:13,764
So propose to her.

1195
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,367
I will get married soon.

1196
01:08:16,506 --> 01:08:17,632
Everybody will return home.

1197
01:08:17,707 --> 01:08:18,969
She will go to US.
You will be in India.

1198
01:08:19,141 --> 01:08:20,438
Yes.
- What will you do here alone?

1199
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:23,535
Listen. Listen to me.

1200
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:25,338
Propose to her. Along with
me you also get married.

1201
01:08:25,414 --> 01:08:26,506
You are saying this?

1202
01:08:26,582 --> 01:08:28,550
It took you 50 years to propose.

1203
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:30,208
And you are telling me
to marry in five minutes.

1204
01:08:30,286 --> 01:08:31,514
I will fix your marriage.

1205
01:08:32,054 --> 01:08:35,615
As it is, Anjali
told me Sneha likes you.

1206
01:08:36,259 --> 01:08:37,351
Not Rajveer.

1207
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,694
What are you saying?
- Yes.

1208
01:08:40,463 --> 01:08:41,555
Really?

1209
01:08:41,998 --> 01:08:43,625
Who doesn't like me?

1210
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:54,601
Hey, Sex.

1211
01:08:59,782 --> 01:09:00,976
Sex.

1212
01:09:06,322 --> 01:09:09,985
Why are you staring at me?

1213
01:09:11,594 --> 01:09:12,959
Finally, you have
shown your true colors.

1214
01:09:13,663 --> 01:09:18,225
True colors? Excuse me.
This is my true color.

1215
01:09:19,635 --> 01:09:21,660
Yes. But you are
copying me right now.

1216
01:09:22,038 --> 01:09:24,404
Because he couldn't impress Sneha.

1217
01:09:24,473 --> 01:09:25,565
Get lost.

1218
01:09:26,008 --> 01:09:27,339
My formula is simple.

1219
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:29,369
If I get the girl, I take her.

1220
01:09:30,246 --> 01:09:32,373
If I don't get her,
somebody else will take her.

1221
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:36,246
Who will waste so
much time for a girl?

1222
01:09:38,621 --> 01:09:39,713
And you.

1223
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:43,988
I lost the bet that we
had waged for Sneha.

1224
01:09:44,193 --> 01:09:46,661
But you have not won.

1225
01:09:47,063 --> 01:09:48,997
And I won't let you win.

1226
01:09:49,065 --> 01:09:53,058
Mister, I won't give up. Understood?

1227
01:09:53,135 --> 01:09:54,762
Let's see.
- Sir, which light do you want?

1228
01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:57,772
Night lights or DB lights.

1229
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,301
DB?
- DB means Dance Bar.

1230
01:10:00,676 --> 01:10:03,372
My friend, it's not a
dance bar. It's a marriage.

1231
01:10:03,446 --> 01:10:04,538
Come. I will come with you.

1232
01:10:04,614 --> 01:10:08,243
Otherwise you will convert the
wedding dais into a dance bar. Right?

1233
01:10:08,317 --> 01:10:10,012
Come. I will tell you
where to put up the lights.

1234
01:10:10,086 --> 01:10:11,178
Listen.

1235
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:12,311
He remembered that
I have organized...

1236
01:10:12,388 --> 01:10:13,685
...a bachelor party this evening.
On my behalf.

1237
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:16,383
Are you mad?

1238
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,021
Gutka King is after our lives.

1239
01:10:19,095 --> 01:10:20,221
And you want to party.

1240
01:10:20,296 --> 01:10:22,560
I am doing all this
for Gutka King's money.

1241
01:10:23,466 --> 01:10:25,058
Bachelor party is just an excuse.

1242
01:10:25,768 --> 01:10:27,235
So that Sneha thinks ill of me.

1243
01:10:27,303 --> 01:10:29,669
And Aarav already
doesn't think well of me.

1244
01:10:35,578 --> 01:10:37,512
Shake it. Shake it.

1245
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:43,712
Girl, you think
you might be loving.

1246
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:48,087
Girl, you think you might be fun.

1247
01:10:48,424 --> 01:10:51,587
But let me say,
girl, you are honey.

1248
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:56,062
Let me see you.

1249
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:02,663
I am your daddy, girl.

1250
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:06,307
I am your daddy, girl.

1251
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,206
I am your daddy, girl.

1252
01:11:08,277 --> 01:11:10,677
I am your daddy, girl.

1253
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:14,082
I am your daddy, girl.

1254
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:15,742
I am your daddy, girl.

1255
01:11:20,423 --> 01:11:22,391
I am your daddy, girl.

1256
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:24,119
Oh, no.

1257
01:11:24,193 --> 01:11:26,161
I am your daddy, girl.

1258
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:31,299
Anjali. Anjali, calm down.

1259
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:33,096
How?

1260
01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:35,498
If he makes one mistake,
I can forgive him.

1261
01:11:36,038 --> 01:11:37,665
But they are competing.

1262
01:11:37,807 --> 01:11:41,573
As long as cheap friends like
Rajveer and Aarav are in his life...

1263
01:11:42,278 --> 01:11:43,370
...I won't marry him.

1264
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,847
He will have to either
leave his friends or me.

1265
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:50,152
I am talking to father.
- Anjali.

1266
01:11:50,219 --> 01:11:51,311
Relax.

1267
01:11:51,587 --> 01:11:52,679
Don't make haste.

1268
01:11:53,222 --> 01:11:54,416
Let's think of something. Fine?

1269
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,113
I will bring water for you.

1270
01:12:00,362 --> 01:12:01,590
Are you badly hurt?

1271
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:03,164
No. Forget it.

1272
01:12:03,332 --> 01:12:05,027
Listen, what are you doing here?

1273
01:12:06,235 --> 01:12:07,395
I want to tell you something.

1274
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:10,132
I like your hair. It's changed.
- Leave my hair.

1275
01:12:10,673 --> 01:12:14,473
Okay. I had called the
strippers and the item girls

1276
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:15,768
So?
- Since the time I have come here...

1277
01:12:16,011 --> 01:12:17,342
...I didn't get time to do anything.

1278
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:18,705
It's okay. So?

1279
01:12:19,482 --> 01:12:20,574
What do you mean so?

1280
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:23,583
I am really a playboy and...
- Sneha.

1281
01:12:23,753 --> 01:12:25,015
Oh, God.

1282
01:12:26,255 --> 01:12:27,313
Hi.

1283
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:29,516
You had gone to fetch water,
hadn't you? - Yes.

1284
01:12:30,092 --> 01:12:31,184
Are you taking a shower?

1285
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,490
I thought I will freshen up.

1286
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:35,256
At 2 o'clock in the night?

1287
01:12:35,331 --> 01:12:37,162
Yes. I was feeling a little tired.

1288
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:39,657
Come. Take a bath.

1289
01:12:39,735 --> 01:12:42,033
I am really stressed.
I need to talk to you.

1290
01:12:42,671 --> 01:12:44,571
Take a bath. I will
stand here and talk to you.

1291
01:12:45,341 --> 01:12:46,740
Will you take a bath fully clothed?

1292
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,072
You know what, Sneha?

1293
01:12:49,245 --> 01:12:52,237
You were right. I don't
think you should marry Nikhil.

1294
01:12:52,782 --> 01:12:56,616
Do you know? I always felt
Nikhil is different from other boys.

1295
01:12:56,786 --> 01:12:58,048
But no.

1296
01:12:58,754 --> 01:13:01,348
He also turned out to be
cheap like Rajveer and Aarav.

1297
01:13:01,657 --> 01:13:04,455
He shows interest in
other girls while I am there.

1298
01:13:04,693 --> 01:13:07,560
You saw, didn't you,
Sneha? Nikhil was all over them.

1299
01:13:07,797 --> 01:13:11,164
It's true. All boys are the same.

1300
01:13:11,534 --> 01:13:13,627
Dog. They see a girl and...

1301
01:14:16,632 --> 01:14:18,429
Are you sister Sneha?
- No.

1302
01:14:19,702 --> 01:14:21,033
Mantu...

1303
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:25,735
What is this?
- For whom is this flower?

1304
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:27,438
For sister Sneha.

1305
01:14:27,509 --> 01:14:29,204
Brother Aarav has given.

1306
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:36,775
You go. I'll handle this.
- Okay.

1307
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:43,214
Pal, is he proposing to
Sneha for sex or marriage?

1308
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:45,516
Orange flower?
- He is a duffer.

1309
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:47,690
I'll go talk to him.

1310
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:23,724
'The fragrance of Henna
will not suffice you.'

1311
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,434
'So I thought of sending the
fragrance of flowers too.'

1312
01:15:27,169 --> 01:15:29,069
'With love. Aarav.'

1313
01:15:32,007 --> 01:15:34,271
Yes, Aarav. You can do it.

1314
01:15:34,476 --> 01:15:37,070
Confidence. Confidence. Confidence.

1315
01:15:37,546 --> 01:15:38,638
Hey.
- Hey.

1316
01:15:39,815 --> 01:15:43,376
I really liked the flowers
you sent. - Really? - Thanks.

1317
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,584
Flowers? I had sent one...

1318
01:15:46,655 --> 01:15:49,180
I would've liked it just as
much if you had sent just one.

1319
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:50,383
Really?

1320
01:15:50,793 --> 01:15:52,522
You're flirting, aren't you?
- Yes.

1321
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,594
I like flirting with you.

1322
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,560
I feel very special
when you're with me.

1323
01:16:08,277 --> 01:16:09,369
Just kidding.

1324
01:16:11,213 --> 01:16:14,114
Mad.
- Shall we have food? Lunch.

1325
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,676
Shall we have lunch?
- Good idea.

1326
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:20,380
Actually, I am also really
bored of having food in this hotel.

1327
01:16:20,456 --> 01:16:22,253
Yes, I like variety. You see.

1328
01:16:22,324 --> 01:16:23,382
Come.

1329
01:16:26,095 --> 01:16:28,154
You like it?
- Yes.

1330
01:16:29,131 --> 01:16:32,225
Look, no country should
get water for free. Okay?

1331
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:34,434
The cost of water
must go up every day.

1332
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:37,334
Text me and tell me how much
was the turnover of water...

1333
01:16:37,406 --> 01:16:39,271
...in Dubai and Singapore. Go.

1334
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:42,270
Dude, want to talk to you.

1335
01:16:42,578 --> 01:16:43,704
What?

1336
01:16:44,246 --> 01:16:45,304
Come on.

1337
01:16:47,049 --> 01:16:48,141
I'll just come.

1338
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:49,817
What are you doing?
I was feeding her.

1339
01:16:50,052 --> 01:16:51,314
What are you doing like a sidekick?
- What?

1340
01:16:51,387 --> 01:16:52,649
You were supposed to
propose to her, right? - Yes

1341
01:16:52,721 --> 01:16:54,348
So why have you
brought all them for lunch?

1342
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:57,489
She said we'll get bored if
just the two of us have lunch.

1343
01:16:57,559 --> 01:16:59,288
That's why she called
everyone one by one.

1344
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:03,624
Crazy. When will you
propose for marriage?

1345
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:06,462
I will. Get off my back.

1346
01:17:06,535 --> 01:17:08,696
Are you in a hurry?

1347
01:17:08,771 --> 01:17:11,365
You go propose to her. Go. Go.
Do two marriages. Go. Come on.

1348
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:12,735
May I?

1349
01:17:13,475 --> 01:17:14,567
May I?

1350
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:16,143
Look, he doesn't have the guts.

1351
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:21,678
Eventually, I will have to
take... Her responsibility.

1352
01:17:23,752 --> 01:17:25,242
Get lost.
- Dude...

1353
01:17:25,721 --> 01:17:27,018
Hi.

1354
01:17:35,264 --> 01:17:37,289
Aarav, Nikhil is getting married.

1355
01:17:37,566 --> 01:17:39,124
I don't know about Rajveer.

1356
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:41,128
But when are you getting married?

1357
01:17:41,403 --> 01:17:45,464
Actually, uncle, I
have also chosen a girl.

1358
01:17:46,308 --> 01:17:48,173
I just need her approval.

1359
01:17:51,013 --> 01:17:52,173
How sweet!

1360
01:17:57,019 --> 01:18:00,011
Who is she?
- Don't know. - Okay.

1361
01:18:00,422 --> 01:18:03,255
I want to meet you. Out.

1362
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:07,119
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1363
01:18:08,964 --> 01:18:10,693
Excuse me, uncle.
- Cool, dude.

1364
01:18:22,044 --> 01:18:23,238
Yes. Why have you called me?

1365
01:18:23,345 --> 01:18:25,472
I want to talk to you.

1366
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,318
Okay. Tell me.

1367
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,210
I feel we should get married.

1368
01:18:34,223 --> 01:18:35,315
What?!

1369
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:38,421
Nice. Nice joke.

1370
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:40,220
No, Rajveer.

1371
01:18:40,762 --> 01:18:42,093
I am serious.

1372
01:18:44,633 --> 01:18:47,397
Look, Sneha, I am not at
all as you think I am.

1373
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:51,665
In fact, even I don't know what
all I have done to how many girls.

1374
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:53,537
I came to tell you
just this yesterday.

1375
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:54,803
But I didn't get the chance.

1376
01:18:55,244 --> 01:18:56,336
I don't believe you, Rajveer.

1377
01:18:56,612 --> 01:18:59,376
You know. Honor is
dear to every girl.

1378
01:18:59,548 --> 01:19:01,482
And yesterday you saw me...
- I didn't see anything.

1379
01:19:02,217 --> 01:19:03,309
Nothing.
- You did.

1380
01:19:03,385 --> 01:19:04,682
I swear. I didn't see anything.

1381
01:19:04,753 --> 01:19:06,050
You had opened your
eyes from time to time.

1382
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:09,488
No, I didn't. Before I could open
them, thanks to Anjali's ranting...

1383
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:11,456
I lost the moment.

1384
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,284
You didn't want to see?

1385
01:19:15,063 --> 01:19:16,553
I didn't.
- Why?

1386
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:18,360
Why didn't you want to see?

1387
01:19:20,335 --> 01:19:21,427
Because...

1388
01:19:23,438 --> 01:19:25,531
...because Aarav loves you.

1389
01:19:28,577 --> 01:19:30,545
But I love you.

1390
01:19:35,184 --> 01:19:36,242
But I don't.

1391
01:19:36,385 --> 01:19:37,477
So you want to hear it?

1392
01:19:38,687 --> 01:19:40,985
I just wanted to use you.

1393
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:44,386
But you couldn't.

1394
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:48,262
Because you love me, Rajveer.

1395
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:52,757
That's why when I was taking off
my clothes, you had shut your eyes.

1396
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,035
You know, Rajveer.

1397
01:19:56,538 --> 01:19:57,630
This is love.

1398
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:02,540
Your love is right in front
of you, but you don't realize.

1399
01:20:03,745 --> 01:20:05,645
And when this
friendship turns into liking...

1400
01:20:05,714 --> 01:20:10,014
...this liking into love
and love into marriage.

1401
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:12,347
You don't even realize.

1402
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:14,583
Look at your eyes.

1403
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:19,185
What? What's in my eyes?

1404
01:20:20,495 --> 01:20:21,689
Love.

1405
01:20:34,076 --> 01:20:35,202
Sorry.

1406
01:20:36,378 --> 01:20:37,606
What's wrong? Why are you laughing?

1407
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,408
I was just kidding.

1408
01:20:39,815 --> 01:20:42,409
Seems like you're
actually in love with me.

1409
01:20:43,185 --> 01:20:44,277
What do you mean?

1410
01:20:44,419 --> 01:20:46,819
I was just joking. Idiot. Joking.

1411
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:49,350
Relax.

1412
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:52,125
You know. I don't love you.

1413
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:55,162
What did you think? I
don't know anything about you?

1414
01:20:55,597 --> 01:20:59,260
Dude, Anjali is not just my friend,
she is like my sister. Okay.

1415
01:20:59,368 --> 01:21:02,735
She had told me everything
about you and Aarav the first day.

1416
01:21:03,772 --> 01:21:08,232
The two of you changed
your look, style to woo me.

1417
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:09,777
Even behavior. Wow.

1418
01:21:10,212 --> 01:21:14,012
What did you think? You
would use me like a tissue.

1419
01:21:15,317 --> 01:21:16,409
I did.

1420
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:24,022
Hey, Rajveer. Relax.

1421
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:25,286
No hard feelings. Okay?

1422
01:21:25,627 --> 01:21:27,094
It's a wedding.

1423
01:21:27,362 --> 01:21:29,057
Fooling around is usual.

1424
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:30,788
You joked with me. So did I.

1425
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:32,125
We are equal.

1426
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:34,201
No sorry. No apologies. Okay?

1427
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:36,797
Yes? Take care.

1428
01:21:42,577 --> 01:21:45,375
Yes. Aarav loves me.

1429
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:47,075
Genuinely. Okay.

1430
01:21:47,716 --> 01:21:49,684
And he is a nice guy.

1431
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:51,445
I also like him.

1432
01:21:55,357 --> 01:21:56,483
Bye.

1433
01:22:48,143 --> 01:22:49,269
Funny.

1434
01:22:53,315 --> 01:22:54,748
Do you know? Why you always wear...

1435
01:22:54,816 --> 01:22:56,215
...the wedding ring in this finger?

1436
01:22:56,284 --> 01:22:58,809
This finger is for your parents.
This is for your siblings.

1437
01:22:59,121 --> 01:23:00,315
This is for your friends.

1438
01:23:00,389 --> 01:23:03,790
This is for you. And this
is for your life partner.

1439
01:23:04,025 --> 01:23:07,051
And this life partner
will never leave you.

1440
01:23:07,129 --> 01:23:08,323
How cute!

1441
01:23:15,103 --> 01:23:16,263
Look over there.

1442
01:23:19,775 --> 01:23:22,039
Oh God!

1443
01:23:23,779 --> 01:23:27,044
Oh God!
- Oh boy!

1444
01:23:59,448 --> 01:24:04,351
7... 8. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8.

1445
01:24:04,486 --> 01:24:07,683
1... 2... 3... 4. Looking good.

1446
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:10,054
Keep it up. Turn.

1447
01:24:10,225 --> 01:24:12,659
Hello. What the hell!

1448
01:24:12,727 --> 01:24:14,285
What are you guys doing?

1449
01:24:16,531 --> 01:24:18,624
Hey, Aarav. What are you guys doing?

1450
01:24:19,034 --> 01:24:21,002
I thought this would
look better. You know.

1451
01:24:21,136 --> 01:24:22,433
Dude, what are you doing?

1452
01:24:22,504 --> 01:24:23,698
Will you get us
disgraced in front of everyone...

1453
01:24:23,772 --> 01:24:25,034
...in the 'Sangeet'
(Pre marriage ceremony).

1454
01:24:25,106 --> 01:24:27,506
Do it properly.
- Come on, pal.

1455
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:30,435
Rajveer, why aren't you rehearsing?

1456
01:24:30,512 --> 01:24:32,207
Couldn't find any dance partner?

1457
01:24:33,148 --> 01:24:34,581
No one here is worthy of me.

1458
01:24:36,818 --> 01:24:38,046
My band.

1459
01:24:39,721 --> 01:24:41,621
Am I worthy of you?
- He...

1460
01:24:54,436 --> 01:24:55,562
Wow.

1461
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:11,312
Vaishali.

1462
01:25:13,255 --> 01:25:14,381
Hi.

1463
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:18,088
Hi. Congratulations. - Thank
God you came before the wedding.

1464
01:25:18,226 --> 01:25:21,218
If you hadn't come today, I
would've never, ever spoken to you.

1465
01:25:21,296 --> 01:25:24,629
Hi. - Congratulations. - Hi.
Thank you. Thank you.

1466
01:25:25,033 --> 01:25:27,160
Meet my best friend, Sneha.
- Hi. - Hi.

1467
01:25:27,235 --> 01:25:29,396
And this is Nikhil's
childhood buddy, Aarav. - Hey.

1468
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:33,702
This is the other
childhood buddy. Rajveer.

1469
01:25:33,775 --> 01:25:36,141
Hi. Rajveer.
- Hi.

1470
01:25:38,246 --> 01:25:39,474
Will you...

1471
01:25:40,515 --> 01:25:42,244
...be my dance partner?

1472
01:25:42,484 --> 01:25:43,815
As you just said.

1473
01:25:44,052 --> 01:25:46,520
I'd love to. Of course.

1474
01:25:52,594 --> 01:25:53,754
Oh.
- What.

1475
01:25:56,231 --> 01:25:57,357
Thank you.

1476
01:25:58,199 --> 01:25:59,757
I wonder what the rascal
is going to do to her now.

1477
01:26:02,737 --> 01:26:04,068
No. Nothing.

1478
01:26:04,306 --> 01:26:09,369
We'll take you. We'll
take you with us on a horse.

1479
01:26:11,313 --> 01:26:16,580
We'll take you. We'll
take you away as our bride.

1480
01:26:18,219 --> 01:26:21,586
We'll take you. We'll
take you with us on a horse.

1481
01:26:21,656 --> 01:26:25,752
We'll take you. We'll
take you away as our bride.

1482
01:26:28,029 --> 01:26:31,692
Millions would be
mesmerized by these mesmeric eyes.

1483
01:26:31,766 --> 01:26:35,202
She'll fly away with
our hearts secretly.

1484
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:40,537
We'll take you. We'll take
you away in front of everyone.

1485
01:26:40,609 --> 01:26:42,577
In front of everyone.

1486
01:26:43,511 --> 01:26:45,672
In front of everyone.

1487
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:49,478
In front of everyone.

1488
01:26:50,418 --> 01:26:52,613
In front of everyone.

1489
01:26:52,687 --> 01:26:56,384
In front of everyone.

1490
01:27:23,351 --> 01:27:27,048
Even the moon pales in
comparison to our stunning beauty.

1491
01:27:30,225 --> 01:27:33,661
Even the moon pales in
comparison to this stunning beauty.

1492
01:27:33,795 --> 01:27:37,094
My heart knows no bounds.

1493
01:27:37,165 --> 01:27:40,623
I thank my God. My
wish has come true.

1494
01:27:40,702 --> 01:27:43,637
I've found heaven on earth.

1495
01:27:43,705 --> 01:27:47,300
Millions would be
mesmerized by these mesmeric eyes.

1496
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:50,742
She'll fly away with
our hearts secretly.

1497
01:27:50,812 --> 01:27:56,216
We'll take you. We'll take
you away in front of everyone.

1498
01:27:56,284 --> 01:27:58,275
In front of everyone.

1499
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:01,484
In front of everyone.

1500
01:28:01,556 --> 01:28:05,014
In front of everyone.

1501
01:28:06,094 --> 01:28:08,392
In front of everyone.

1502
01:28:08,463 --> 01:28:13,400
In front of everyone.

1503
01:28:39,694 --> 01:28:41,025
Hey.

1504
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:43,756
Hey.

1505
01:28:45,567 --> 01:28:47,125
Why have you come out
leaving the 'Sangeet'?

1506
01:28:48,303 --> 01:28:49,429
Nothing.

1507
01:28:50,438 --> 01:28:52,565
I got a bit tense about
your wedding and money.

1508
01:28:55,176 --> 01:28:57,508
Come on, tell me. I
know it's something else.

1509
01:28:57,712 --> 01:28:59,043
Tell me. What happened?

1510
01:29:02,517 --> 01:29:03,984
I am so baffled.

1511
01:29:06,387 --> 01:29:08,412
So many girls came and went.

1512
01:29:09,124 --> 01:29:11,354
I have dumped them just like that.
Didn't give them a second look.

1513
01:29:11,559 --> 01:29:13,686
Darn her! She used me.

1514
01:29:15,296 --> 01:29:17,196
This has happened to
me for the first time.

1515
01:29:17,766 --> 01:29:19,495
And I am feeling
this for the first time.

1516
01:29:21,102 --> 01:29:23,434
Those two... I am jealous.

1517
01:29:23,972 --> 01:29:25,200
I am jealous.

1518
01:29:25,573 --> 01:29:27,404
I can't bear to see
the two of them together.

1519
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:35,347
Are you... are you in love with Sneha?

1520
01:29:44,325 --> 01:29:45,587
What the hell.

1521
01:29:48,229 --> 01:29:50,060
Where are you going?
- To Aarav.

1522
01:29:50,298 --> 01:29:52,289
Are you out of your mind?
- We'll have to tell him everything.

1523
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,659
How long are we going to
keep fooling him? - But listen...

1524
01:30:20,261 --> 01:30:22,320
Sir, you gave us seven days time.

1525
01:30:23,331 --> 01:30:25,026
This is just the fourth day, sir.

1526
01:30:26,634 --> 01:30:27,794
Did I say anything?

1527
01:30:29,671 --> 01:30:31,832
Did I say anything? Did
I ask for money from you?

1528
01:30:32,473 --> 01:30:35,306
I have come here to
ask from someone else.

1529
01:30:38,313 --> 01:30:41,646
Look, sir, you'll get your money.

1530
01:30:42,784 --> 01:30:44,684
Once our friend Aarav gets married.

1531
01:30:46,421 --> 01:30:48,787
Who is your third friend?

1532
01:30:49,624 --> 01:30:54,755
You mean I won't get the money
till he gets married? Is that so?

1533
01:30:55,263 --> 01:30:57,288
Actually, we friends
have bought 1 lakh shares...

1534
01:30:57,365 --> 01:30:59,299
...of Reliance a few years ago.

1535
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:01,466
And we had signed this contract...

1536
01:31:01,603 --> 01:31:04,697
...that this 1 lakh will belong
to the one who doesn't marry.

1537
01:31:06,007 --> 01:31:08,066
All our friends have got married.
It's just the three of us left.

1538
01:31:08,343 --> 01:31:09,537
Nikhil is getting married.

1539
01:31:09,777 --> 01:31:13,178
And we're setting Aarav up with
a girl to get him married. - Yes.

1540
01:31:15,483 --> 01:31:19,647
This Aarav and stuff is rubbish.

1541
01:31:19,787 --> 01:31:23,450
Do you know you're movie stars?

1542
01:31:24,459 --> 01:31:28,418
That in the end, you'll kill the
villain and take the heroine away.

1543
01:31:28,763 --> 01:31:30,287
As if you own it?

1544
01:31:32,767 --> 01:31:36,828
You still have three more days.

1545
01:31:37,839 --> 01:31:40,603
I want my money within three days.

1546
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:44,709
Or you shoot yourselves.

1547
01:31:45,113 --> 01:31:47,547
I don't have time even
for that. Understood?

1548
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:50,544
See you.

1549
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:55,385
What are you looking at?

1550
01:32:13,374 --> 01:32:15,569
Now I know how
come this dog changed.

1551
01:32:17,412 --> 01:32:18,606
You call me a friend.

1552
01:32:19,747 --> 01:32:21,271
You call me a friend, don't you?

1553
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,740
Then why didn't you tell me?

1554
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,651
You should've told me once.

1555
01:32:27,588 --> 01:32:30,716
I would've sold my father's house
to save you. Let alone the stocks.

1556
01:32:33,428 --> 01:32:35,055
Do you know why I call you a dog?

1557
01:32:35,663 --> 01:32:37,255
Do you know why I call you a dog?

1558
01:32:39,167 --> 01:32:41,328
Because a dog is loyal. You rascal.

1559
01:32:43,504 --> 01:32:47,600
Ever since childhood, you've
fought with me with loyalty, right?

1560
01:32:50,144 --> 01:32:51,668
So why now?

1561
01:32:53,348 --> 01:32:54,508
Why now?

1562
01:32:58,119 --> 01:33:00,383
Because your thinking
is like a dog's tail.

1563
01:33:01,622 --> 01:33:04,090
You'll always think
in a crooked manner.

1564
01:33:06,527 --> 01:33:07,619
Get off.

1565
01:33:08,262 --> 01:33:09,627
You are worse than him.

1566
01:33:10,465 --> 01:33:12,592
There is no abuse for
you even in the dictionary.

1567
01:33:13,368 --> 01:33:15,529
He didn't tell me anything.
I can understand.

1568
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:17,331
He just doesn't trust me.

1569
01:33:19,507 --> 01:33:21,600
But you, Nikhil. You.

1570
01:33:23,745 --> 01:33:25,372
Why did you not tell me?

1571
01:33:26,347 --> 01:33:28,577
You were setting me up...

1572
01:33:28,649 --> 01:33:31,447
...with Sneha and
Vaishali for those mere stocks.

1573
01:33:34,322 --> 01:33:36,586
Look. Look, don't get too emotional.

1574
01:33:37,225 --> 01:33:39,216
Whatever he has done
is for the wedding.

1575
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:41,184
I swear your
wedding will not happen.

1576
01:33:43,564 --> 01:33:45,054
I swear your
wedding will not happen.

1577
01:33:47,268 --> 01:33:48,633
This guy has put me in trouble.

1578
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:50,801
He has put you in trouble.

1579
01:33:52,273 --> 01:33:57,336
And when I put you in trouble,
you'll realize what pain is.

1580
01:33:57,545 --> 01:33:58,739
I will not get married.

1581
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,570
I am not signing the stock papers.

1582
01:34:00,715 --> 01:34:02,273
Do whatever you can. Rascals.

1583
01:34:02,483 --> 01:34:05,975
To hell with you. To hell with him.

1584
01:34:07,288 --> 01:34:08,983
To hell with your wedding.

1585
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:12,786
And to hell with this friendship.

1586
01:34:25,573 --> 01:34:26,665
I am going.

1587
01:34:28,242 --> 01:34:30,142
To tell father and
Anjali's father everything.

1588
01:34:32,246 --> 01:34:33,736
We will see whatever happens.

1589
01:34:34,449 --> 01:34:36,417
If they want to help us,
they will help us. Otherwise...

1590
01:34:36,651 --> 01:34:37,743
Whatever God wills.

1591
01:34:39,754 --> 01:34:41,016
Hold on.

1592
01:34:42,223 --> 01:34:43,281
Are you sure?

1593
01:34:48,663 --> 01:34:51,097
No. No. No. I don't care.

1594
01:34:51,232 --> 01:34:52,494
No matter how much loss I incur.

1595
01:34:52,567 --> 01:34:53,761
One crore. Two crores.

1596
01:34:54,068 --> 01:34:55,399
I just don't care.

1597
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:58,670
Tell that man to
withdraw the case. That's it.

1598
01:34:59,073 --> 01:35:01,371
Don't give me useless suggestions.

1599
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:02,634
He is already tense.

1600
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:04,109
I want to run the company
and not lead it to bankruptcy.

1601
01:35:04,178 --> 01:35:05,645
We shouldn't give him more stress.
- Just do as I say. - Let's go.

1602
01:35:05,713 --> 01:35:07,112
You are right.
- You got it? - Let's go.

1603
01:35:07,348 --> 01:35:09,612
Hey, boys.
- Yes. - Why are you leaving? Come

1604
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,445
Have a seat. Sit.

1605
01:35:14,188 --> 01:35:15,416
Anyway, what's the matter?

1606
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:18,058
No, father. You seem tense.

1607
01:35:18,626 --> 01:35:23,325
Pests and flies were
found in our soft drink Gypsy

1608
01:35:23,564 --> 01:35:27,125
The man who was sipping it
has filed a suit of 50 crores...

1609
01:35:27,201 --> 01:35:28,998
...against our company.

1610
01:35:29,137 --> 01:35:30,434
Scoundrel.

1611
01:35:31,305 --> 01:35:33,739
Anyway, I will have to go
to India for the settlement.

1612
01:35:36,277 --> 01:35:38,245
Will you guys do one thing?
- Yes.

1613
01:35:38,713 --> 01:35:39,771
Tell me, uncle.

1614
01:35:40,148 --> 01:35:41,240
Just a moment.

1615
01:35:49,223 --> 01:35:51,623
This is cash. Two crores.

1616
01:35:53,227 --> 01:35:55,320
I am going to India
for the settlement.

1617
01:35:55,530 --> 01:36:00,024
Will you keep it safely till then?
- Yes, father.

1618
01:36:00,201 --> 01:36:03,637
Look, this money is for the hotel
bills and the marriage expenses.

1619
01:36:04,405 --> 01:36:06,669
If my wife or
daughter gets hold of it...

1620
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:08,470
...they will splurge
it on shopping. Okay?

1621
01:36:08,576 --> 01:36:10,203
Keep it safely.

1622
01:36:15,249 --> 01:36:16,307
What?

1623
01:36:20,988 --> 01:36:22,285
Don't even think of it.

1624
01:36:23,124 --> 01:36:25,285
Look, listen to me.

1625
01:36:27,361 --> 01:36:29,329
I have a brilliant idea.

1626
01:36:30,264 --> 01:36:31,322
Brilliant idea?

1627
01:36:31,465 --> 01:36:33,228
Last time you played stocks.

1628
01:36:33,367 --> 01:36:35,096
I am still suffering because of it.

1629
01:36:35,169 --> 01:36:38,297
I am not saying to
invest it in stocks. - So?

1630
01:36:42,376 --> 01:36:43,468
SPL.

1631
01:36:43,778 --> 01:36:47,270
SPL? Have you gone crazy?
You will invest money in SPL?

1632
01:36:47,348 --> 01:36:50,010
Nowadays even beggars invest
money in SPL. Why can't we?

1633
01:36:50,484 --> 01:36:53,146
Two crores will become 20
crores in a jiffy. In an instant.

1634
01:36:53,588 --> 01:36:57,046
As it is, only two days are left
for the semi-finals and finals.

1635
01:36:57,425 --> 01:36:59,290
Look, listen to me.

1636
01:36:59,794 --> 01:37:04,697
We have no other option right now.
Please. - We have an option.

1637
01:37:04,999 --> 01:37:07,160
I will go and give this money to
Gutka King. That's the only option.

1638
01:37:07,235 --> 01:37:08,634
What do you think?
Gutka King is a bank.

1639
01:37:08,703 --> 01:37:09,965
You will keep depositing money.

1640
01:37:10,037 --> 01:37:11,504
Even if you give him two crores...

1641
01:37:11,772 --> 01:37:13,205
...will he forget the
rest of the money?

1642
01:37:13,274 --> 01:37:14,332
Even if he lets go of it...

1643
01:37:15,243 --> 01:37:18,144
...what will you tell
uncle when he returns?

1644
01:37:18,212 --> 01:37:19,270
What about my marriage?

1645
01:37:19,347 --> 01:37:20,541
What marriage are you
talking about, Nikhil?

1646
01:37:20,615 --> 01:37:21,673
The marriage that can't take place.

1647
01:37:21,749 --> 01:37:23,307
Will Gutka King let you get married?

1648
01:37:24,785 --> 01:37:27,413
Please. Think about it calmly.

1649
01:37:29,156 --> 01:37:31,624
This is the last option we have.

1650
01:37:32,426 --> 01:37:36,123
20 crores can change our lives.

1651
01:37:36,197 --> 01:37:38,757
Not 20. Two crores.
- Two will multiply into 20. Think.

1652
01:37:42,403 --> 01:37:45,065
One last gamble. Last time.

1653
01:37:48,009 --> 01:37:49,067
Please.

1654
01:37:51,245 --> 01:37:52,337
Trust me.

1655
01:37:54,715 --> 01:37:56,273
'Welcome to the exciting match... '

1656
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:57,612
'... between the two
teams from the South.'

1657
01:37:57,685 --> 01:37:59,118
'Chennai and Hyderabad.'

1658
01:38:01,289 --> 01:38:02,381
Baba, Rajveer.
- Yes. Tell me.

1659
01:38:02,556 --> 01:38:04,490
What's the rate?
- 70-75. Chennai favorite.

1660
01:38:04,959 --> 01:38:07,450
'That's a very quick
shot to the boundary.'

1661
01:38:07,528 --> 01:38:09,621
'And another one to mid-wicket.'

1662
01:38:10,431 --> 01:38:12,558
Bet 50 lakhs on Hyderabad.
- Yes. Fine.

1663
01:38:13,668 --> 01:38:16,136
'It's really tense out there.'

1664
01:38:16,737 --> 01:38:19,001
'That's gone. That's a good wicket.'

1665
01:38:20,074 --> 01:38:21,974
'Things look really
good for Chennai.'

1666
01:38:22,576 --> 01:38:25,204
'That will be close. The umpire's
called for the third umpire.

1667
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:26,576
Yes!
- 'Out! '

1668
01:38:26,647 --> 01:38:28,774
'Chennai's are going wild.'
- Wow!

1669
01:38:30,451 --> 01:38:32,476
Yes. 1.5 crores on Chennai.
- Why on Chennai?

1670
01:38:32,553 --> 01:38:34,282
They are winning.
- Leave it to me.

1671
01:38:34,355 --> 01:38:36,255
I know the game is going
to change. Nikhil, please.

1672
01:38:36,324 --> 01:38:38,053
Trust me. Trust me. Yes. Yes.

1673
01:38:41,062 --> 01:38:42,154
Yeah!

1674
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:44,355
'Good shot.'
- Come on. Come on.

1675
01:38:45,633 --> 01:38:47,191
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1676
01:38:47,501 --> 01:38:48,729
Yes!

1677
01:38:51,138 --> 01:38:53,402
Nikhil, see this.
- Baby, please. Later.

1678
01:38:53,474 --> 01:38:55,533
Honeymoon's dress.
- We have still not got married.

1679
01:38:55,609 --> 01:38:57,099
Oh, no.
- You have gone crazy.

1680
01:38:57,178 --> 01:38:58,805
'Good shot. Very good shot.'
- We lost 10.

1681
01:38:59,046 --> 01:39:00,104
Oh, no.

1682
01:39:00,414 --> 01:39:01,938
You guys are gambling?

1683
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:03,278
She is unlucky. Get rid of her.

1684
01:39:03,351 --> 01:39:04,545
Yes, baby. Leave.

1685
01:39:05,953 --> 01:39:07,477
Forget it.
- Move from the front.

1686
01:39:07,555 --> 01:39:08,715
'... doing it really well.'

1687
01:39:09,323 --> 01:39:10,483
Out! Yes!

1688
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:17,327
Look. Look. Look.

1689
01:39:18,632 --> 01:39:20,657
Yeah! We did it, dude!

1690
01:39:23,504 --> 01:39:24,630
Yes!

1691
01:39:38,018 --> 01:39:39,178
Hi.

1692
01:39:47,595 --> 01:39:49,358
Listen, this is Rajveer.
- Yes. Tell me.

1693
01:39:50,231 --> 01:39:52,131
Who is the favorite?
- Bangalore.

1694
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:55,298
At the rate of 80 bet
one crore on Bangalore.

1695
01:39:56,303 --> 01:39:58,396
'That's a glorious shot,
covers for boundary.'

1696
01:39:58,806 --> 01:40:00,637
'A beautiful start
for the Mumbai team.'

1697
01:40:01,175 --> 01:40:03,405
'That's very close. Will
it be catch or run out? '

1698
01:40:03,711 --> 01:40:05,770
Yes! - 'The batsman
runs between the wickets.'

1699
01:40:06,013 --> 01:40:07,378
'There's a huge appeal.'

1700
01:40:07,448 --> 01:40:10,144
'For the umpire this is
going to be very tough.'

1701
01:40:10,217 --> 01:40:11,309
Out!
- Yes!

1702
01:40:11,385 --> 01:40:13,785
Control it! Control it! - 'A
huge score for the Mumbai team.'

1703
01:40:15,322 --> 01:40:16,482
Yes!

1704
01:40:17,825 --> 01:40:21,124
'Oh my, God. That's huge.'

1705
01:40:22,496 --> 01:40:23,724
Six!

1706
01:40:25,299 --> 01:40:27,824
Wow. - I told you. I told you.
I told you. - Yes! Yes! Yes!

1707
01:40:28,202 --> 01:40:29,601
That's a huge turn
around in the play.

1708
01:40:32,273 --> 01:40:33,501
Come on.

1709
01:40:36,544 --> 01:40:38,034
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1710
01:40:39,814 --> 01:40:41,247
Six!

1711
01:40:41,682 --> 01:40:43,616
It looks like a one way traffic...

1712
01:40:43,684 --> 01:40:45,117
...the Bangalore boys are
not going to leave it.

1713
01:40:45,419 --> 01:40:46,784
Baba, Rajveer.
- Yes.

1714
01:40:47,321 --> 01:40:48,549
Bangalore is the favorite. 50.

1715
01:40:48,722 --> 01:40:50,280
I bet two crores on Mumbai.

1716
01:40:51,392 --> 01:40:53,553
Rajveer, have you gone crazy?
- Nikhil.

1717
01:40:53,727 --> 01:40:55,422
What are you doing?
- Nikhil, trust me.

1718
01:40:55,496 --> 01:40:57,191
Bangalore is playing well.
Why are you betting on Mumbai?

1719
01:40:57,465 --> 01:41:00,400
Trust me. I know the
game will change again.

1720
01:41:01,235 --> 01:41:03,260
There's another one
over square leg for six.

1721
01:41:03,604 --> 01:41:04,662
It's a catch.

1722
01:41:05,573 --> 01:41:07,165
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

1723
01:41:07,241 --> 01:41:08,367
Caught at the boundary rope.

1724
01:41:10,511 --> 01:41:11,637
Hi.

1725
01:41:14,381 --> 01:41:15,780
What's going on? Who is playing?

1726
01:41:23,757 --> 01:41:25,054
Yes!

1727
01:41:38,305 --> 01:41:39,363
Out!

1728
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,533
'Right at the boundary.'

1729
01:41:42,343 --> 01:41:44,311
Out!
- Yes!

1730
01:41:47,214 --> 01:41:48,704
Yes!
- Wow!

1731
01:41:51,051 --> 01:41:52,279
Yes!

1732
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:54,685
No matter what you say.
She is lucky for you, man.

1733
01:41:54,755 --> 01:41:56,416
She is lucky, dude.

1734
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:58,048
Unbelievable performance.

1735
01:41:58,192 --> 01:41:59,454
What happened?

1736
01:41:59,793 --> 01:42:01,454
Get me that girl.

1737
01:42:02,062 --> 01:42:04,758
I want her. Please. I want her.

1738
01:42:05,132 --> 01:42:08,397
Am I a pimp? Am I a pimp?
- So become one.

1739
01:42:13,073 --> 01:42:14,631
Total is three crores 40 lakhs.

1740
01:42:15,175 --> 01:42:18,201
Until now, we have made three
crores 40 lakhs from two matches.

1741
01:42:18,612 --> 01:42:20,102
Your father-in-law's two crores.

1742
01:42:20,447 --> 01:42:22,278
Five crores 40 lakhs.

1743
01:42:22,449 --> 01:42:26,579
Now, we will bet five
crores 40 lakhs on Mumbai.

1744
01:42:26,654 --> 01:42:28,383
This time we won't flip.

1745
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:31,483
Only Mumbai. Right till the end.

1746
01:42:31,659 --> 01:42:32,717
Welcome to the big day.

1747
01:42:32,793 --> 01:42:35,591
Mumbai versus Chennai. The
best game of the competition.

1748
01:42:35,663 --> 01:42:37,824
That's a beautiful
boundary through fine leg.

1749
01:42:39,066 --> 01:42:42,194
Chennai has got a good start.
And that's a huge six... - Out.

1750
01:42:42,469 --> 01:42:44,198
What a delivery
outside the off stump.

1751
01:42:44,371 --> 01:42:46,168
Baba, Rajveer.
- Yes. - What's the rate?

1752
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:48,140
Mumbai is the favorite. 45-50.
- I don't want to bet now.

1753
01:42:48,309 --> 01:42:50,504
This is a huge
turnaround by the... Bold.

1754
01:42:51,645 --> 01:42:54,273
Baba, Rajveer. - Yes.
Mumbai is the favorite. 65-68.

1755
01:42:54,748 --> 01:42:56,682
I don't want to bet now.
- It's such a tight game.

1756
01:42:56,817 --> 01:42:58,409
Nikhil, I know what I am doing.

1757
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,381
Beautiful pull shot.

1758
01:43:01,655 --> 01:43:03,486
That's a beautiful shot.

1759
01:43:03,557 --> 01:43:04,990
Baba, Rajveer.
- Yes. Tell me.

1760
01:43:05,159 --> 01:43:07,354
What's the rate? Mumbai
is the favorite. 79-80.

1761
01:43:08,095 --> 01:43:09,153
No. Not now.

1762
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:10,988
Have you gone crazy?

1763
01:43:11,498 --> 01:43:13,227
Chennai is trying to get a six.

1764
01:43:13,467 --> 01:43:15,230
That's a huge six.

1765
01:43:24,345 --> 01:43:27,212
Baba, Rajveer.
- Yes. Mumbai. 90-95.

1766
01:43:27,348 --> 01:43:29,441
Not now.
- Rajveer, this is...

1767
01:43:29,516 --> 01:43:31,313
Looks very unlikely. But...
- Oh, no.

1768
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:34,053
That's bold.

1769
01:43:37,691 --> 01:43:40,524
Baba, Rajveer.
- Yes. Chennai favorite. 65-70.

1770
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:43,821
Do you want to bet or not?
Tell me quickly.

1771
01:43:44,765 --> 01:43:46,824
Five crores 40 lakhs on Mumbai.

1772
01:43:47,167 --> 01:43:49,431
Yes. Fine.
- We need a miracle.'

1773
01:43:53,807 --> 01:43:56,435
'Good performance by one
of their key players.'

1774
01:43:59,246 --> 01:44:01,441
'That's another boundary,
that's beautifully played.'

1775
01:44:02,716 --> 01:44:04,206
'Six.'

1776
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:26,997
Take it. Out.

1777
01:44:27,708 --> 01:44:30,074
This match has been
turning around every over.

1778
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:34,343
That's a boundary. No. That's out.

1779
01:44:35,749 --> 01:44:37,774
That's such a huge turnover.

1780
01:44:38,152 --> 01:44:39,483
The crowd cannot believe it.

1781
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:41,246
Four.

1782
01:44:44,291 --> 01:44:46,418
Scoundrel. Bet. Bet more on Mumbai.

1783
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:50,460
Is that a six or is
it going to be out?

1784
01:44:51,432 --> 01:44:52,660
That's really high.

1785
01:44:53,267 --> 01:44:54,700
What a brilliant catch!

1786
01:44:55,636 --> 01:44:57,570
Oh, my God.

1787
01:44:58,138 --> 01:44:59,605
Another brilliant catch.

1788
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:03,107
This is just... - Why is this
stupid changing the batting order?

1789
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:05,571
Nobody expected Mumbai to do...

1790
01:45:14,621 --> 01:45:16,088
There it is. Out.

1791
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:18,785
Chennai are the
champions of this tournament

1792
01:45:25,299 --> 01:45:27,597
Look at the scene. Dancing.

1793
01:45:40,114 --> 01:45:43,311
Oh, my God.
Unbelievable performance!

1794
01:45:44,251 --> 01:45:46,014
Fireworks are on.

1795
01:45:57,131 --> 01:45:58,621
Where are you taking me, Anjali?

1796
01:45:59,533 --> 01:46:01,000
Lights.

1797
01:46:21,688 --> 01:46:23,212
It's so beautiful.

1798
01:46:23,724 --> 01:46:26,249
Finally, we are
getting married tomorrow.

1799
01:46:27,728 --> 01:46:30,492
I am so happy. I
love you. You did it.

1800
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:34,060
I am so happy, Nikhil.

1801
01:46:57,791 --> 01:46:59,383
Thank you so much.

1802
01:47:00,427 --> 01:47:02,361
First you brought my wedding dress.

1803
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:05,063
And now, all this.

1804
01:47:06,166 --> 01:47:09,693
You know? This is how I had
always imagined my marriage.

1805
01:47:10,704 --> 01:47:12,604
You made my dream come true.

1806
01:47:14,041 --> 01:47:17,101
Aarav, if I had not
invited you for my marriage...

1807
01:47:17,644 --> 01:47:19,339
...I wouldn't have
got to see all this.

1808
01:47:21,148 --> 01:47:22,376
You know what? You are right.

1809
01:47:22,783 --> 01:47:24,614
If I had not come for the marriage...

1810
01:47:26,286 --> 01:47:28,083
...I also wouldn't have
got to see all this.

1811
01:47:29,156 --> 01:47:31,590
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1812
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:38,464
Nikhil. Fire.

1813
01:47:58,819 --> 01:48:00,514
Nikhil, run. Nikhil, go back.

1814
01:48:34,221 --> 01:48:35,347
Baby.

1815
01:48:36,223 --> 01:48:37,281
It's okay.

1816
01:48:40,527 --> 01:48:42,518
Mother.
- Enough, dear.

1817
01:48:42,629 --> 01:48:44,358
Mother, the
marriage can't take place.

1818
01:48:44,598 --> 01:48:47,032
Don't cry.
- The entire dais got burnt.

1819
01:48:49,436 --> 01:48:52,530
My dress also got burnt.
- Enough, dear.

1820
01:48:56,543 --> 01:49:00,001
It's inauspicious for it
to get burnt. - Quiet.

1821
01:49:01,148 --> 01:49:02,240
Anjali.

1822
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:06,210
Anjali.

1823
01:49:08,188 --> 01:49:09,280
Excuse me.

1824
01:49:12,492 --> 01:49:15,290
Sir, we need to call the police.
The damage is too much.

1825
01:49:16,263 --> 01:49:17,992
No need to call the police.

1826
01:49:18,298 --> 01:49:19,765
I will pay for the damages.

1827
01:49:20,534 --> 01:49:23,526
I will meet you in the office.
Okay? Please. - Okay, sir.

1828
01:49:24,237 --> 01:49:25,295
Let's go.

1829
01:49:27,441 --> 01:49:28,567
Son.

1830
01:49:30,344 --> 01:49:32,608
I gave you two crores.

1831
01:49:34,715 --> 01:49:38,549
Use it to pay the hotel
for the damages. Okay?

1832
01:49:39,252 --> 01:49:40,310
Go.

1833
01:49:41,755 --> 01:49:43,086
Go.

1834
01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:51,722
Uncle...

1835
01:49:54,167 --> 01:49:55,361
Your...

1836
01:49:59,606 --> 01:50:03,337
...two crores... got expended.

1837
01:50:04,778 --> 01:50:06,006
What?
- What?

1838
01:50:08,548 --> 01:50:10,607
Actually, I had borrowed
five crores from someone.

1839
01:50:11,418 --> 01:50:13,147
I invested it in the stock market.

1840
01:50:21,561 --> 01:50:25,827
To repay eight crores, I
invested your two crores in SPL.

1841
01:50:31,304 --> 01:50:32,703
You embezzled my father's money.

1842
01:50:32,806 --> 01:50:35,331
You gambled. Scoundrel.
How could you do this?

1843
01:50:35,409 --> 01:50:37,707
How could you do this? Because
of you my marriage got ruined.

1844
01:50:37,778 --> 01:50:39,370
Shut up. Just shut up.

1845
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:41,805
Nikhil.
- You cry all the time.

1846
01:50:42,716 --> 01:50:44,513
You have made a
spectacle of this marriage.

1847
01:50:46,219 --> 01:50:47,652
All the time, My marriage.
My wedding dress.

1848
01:50:47,721 --> 01:50:49,780
My this. My that. I, me, myself.

1849
01:50:50,590 --> 01:50:53,058
Where am I in all this?
Where are we?

1850
01:50:55,595 --> 01:50:57,222
I know Rajveer made a mistake.

1851
01:50:58,665 --> 01:51:01,498
But today when his life is
in danger, what should I do?

1852
01:51:02,536 --> 01:51:05,232
Should I leave him alone?
Should I let him die?

1853
01:51:06,406 --> 01:51:08,567
And you, what do you think?

1854
01:51:09,476 --> 01:51:11,444
You are everything for me?
- Nikhil. - Nikhil.

1855
01:51:12,045 --> 01:51:13,137
They are nothing?

1856
01:51:13,447 --> 01:51:15,745
Please. Don't say that.
- He is my friend.

1857
01:51:17,751 --> 01:51:19,082
He is my brother.

1858
01:51:20,554 --> 01:51:22,044
I won't let him die alone.

1859
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:24,818
Listen...
- Let anything happen.

1860
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:28,657
I am with him.
- What are you saying, Nikhil?

1861
01:51:29,463 --> 01:51:34,093
Anjali, I am solely
responsible for whatever happened.

1862
01:51:34,601 --> 01:51:38,093
I apologize to you
and everybody else.

1863
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:40,165
I am really sorry.

1864
01:51:41,074 --> 01:51:42,302
I am really sorry.

1865
01:51:44,077 --> 01:51:45,476
So you set this fire?

1866
01:51:48,081 --> 01:51:49,173
What?

1867
01:51:56,490 --> 01:51:57,582
Not deliberately.

1868
01:52:05,065 --> 01:52:07,226
It happened by mistake. I...

1869
01:52:07,367 --> 01:52:10,393
Nikhil, I swear it was an accident.

1870
01:52:11,037 --> 01:52:12,163
Forget the money part.

1871
01:52:16,076 --> 01:52:17,509
What was done was done.

1872
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:25,579
Assume that it's the price
for leaving my daughter.

1873
01:52:25,752 --> 01:52:28,619
Father.
- Uncle, please. You...

1874
01:52:29,122 --> 01:52:31,090
Uncle.
- Brother. Brother, listen to me.

1875
01:52:31,158 --> 01:52:32,352
The marriage is off.

1876
01:52:32,425 --> 01:52:34,017
What are you saying? - We are
returning to India tomorrow.

1877
01:52:34,094 --> 01:52:35,618
You are calling off the marriage?
- What are you doing?

1878
01:52:49,442 --> 01:52:51,501
Good you showed your true colors.

1879
01:52:53,346 --> 01:52:56,474
Otherwise I would have
really fallen in love with you.

1880
01:53:09,362 --> 01:53:11,193
You had already broken friendship.

1881
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:15,727
Today, you broke
his marriage as well.

1882
01:53:26,446 --> 01:53:37,482
I don't know why my eyes
search for you in every path.

1883
01:53:37,724 --> 01:53:48,794
I don't know why my eyes
search for you in every path.

1884
01:53:49,603 --> 01:53:56,839
Whatever was in the
past still exists.

1885
01:53:57,210 --> 01:54:00,236
I am also standing here.

1886
01:54:00,313 --> 01:54:03,407
Where are you?

1887
01:54:03,483 --> 01:54:07,214
Beloved, if you had
to break my heart.

1888
01:54:07,287 --> 01:54:11,018
Why did you fall in love with me?

1889
01:54:11,091 --> 01:54:17,724
Beloved, come once. Beloved.

1890
01:54:24,537 --> 01:54:27,802
She was a glass doll.

1891
01:54:28,308 --> 01:54:31,744
She fell in love
with a stony heart.

1892
01:54:32,112 --> 01:54:38,779
She broke in such a way.
Nothing was in her hand.

1893
01:54:39,019 --> 01:54:43,080
My heart searches there.

1894
01:54:43,156 --> 01:54:46,592
Where we had exchanged promises.

1895
01:54:46,793 --> 01:54:50,285
Where we had bowed
our head in prayer.

1896
01:54:50,363 --> 01:54:54,094
Today, I am still
alone at the same place.

1897
01:54:54,167 --> 01:54:57,728
Beloved, if you had
to break my heart.

1898
01:54:57,804 --> 01:55:01,365
Why did you fall in love with me?

1899
01:55:01,441 --> 01:55:07,971
Beloved, come once. Beloved.

1900
01:55:08,982 --> 01:55:12,679
Beloved, if you had
to break my heart.

1901
01:55:12,752 --> 01:55:16,552
Why did you fall in love with me?

1902
01:55:16,623 --> 01:55:23,461
Beloved, come once. Beloved.

1903
01:55:32,605 --> 01:55:34,766
Beloved.

1904
01:56:01,701 --> 01:56:03,100
You will shoot?

1905
01:56:04,104 --> 01:56:05,503
Or should I start
chewing your tobacco?

1906
01:56:05,672 --> 01:56:09,540
Before chewing the tobacco,
remember one thing.

1907
01:56:10,210 --> 01:56:13,509
The packet will cost Rs. 2. Cash.

1908
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:15,247
If not that...

1909
01:56:15,415 --> 01:56:18,578
Talk respectfully. I will shoot you.

1910
01:56:20,353 --> 01:56:21,547
Shoot.

1911
01:56:22,222 --> 01:56:23,655
He is not alone.

1912
01:56:32,132 --> 01:56:33,429
What are you doing here?

1913
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:39,136
They seem close.

1914
01:56:42,375 --> 01:56:44,104
Bring the dwarf out.

1915
01:56:46,312 --> 01:56:47,370
Aarav.
- Aarav.

1916
01:56:47,447 --> 01:56:49,142
You... you... What are
you doing over here?

1917
01:56:49,582 --> 01:56:51,743
I am having tobacco.
- But...

1918
01:56:52,118 --> 01:56:54,586
You should have told me
that the money is with him.

1919
01:56:54,654 --> 01:56:56,383
I would have picked him up.

1920
01:56:56,589 --> 01:56:58,386
I wouldn't have to get him married.

1921
01:56:58,458 --> 01:57:00,722
I wouldn't have to get
your stock paper signed.

1922
01:57:02,962 --> 01:57:04,452
One bullet and two targets.

1923
01:57:05,298 --> 01:57:07,129
He would have died and you
would have stayed single.

1924
01:57:09,269 --> 01:57:11,328
First money would have gone to you.

1925
01:57:11,638 --> 01:57:13,970
And then in my hands.

1926
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:15,300
Yes?

1927
01:57:15,608 --> 01:57:16,666
Brother...

1928
01:57:17,076 --> 01:57:20,375
Will you sign or should I
give you some more tobacco.

1929
01:57:20,447 --> 01:57:21,607
No, brother. No.

1930
01:57:22,482 --> 01:57:24,040
I cannot have anymore tobacco.

1931
01:57:24,117 --> 01:57:25,675
Give it to me, brother. I will
sign it. - Just a minute, Aarav.

1932
01:57:26,052 --> 01:57:27,178
Wait.

1933
01:57:29,456 --> 01:57:32,584
Both of you have
already done a lot for me.

1934
01:57:33,059 --> 01:57:35,323
Not only done a lot, but
endured a lot as well.

1935
01:57:35,795 --> 01:57:37,422
Not anymore.

1936
01:57:37,764 --> 01:57:40,062
Once I am gone, all the
problems will be over.

1937
01:57:40,233 --> 01:57:41,598
Wait. Let me talk to him.

1938
01:57:48,475 --> 01:57:50,375
Rajveer, do you know
what your problem is?

1939
01:57:51,778 --> 01:57:53,575
You never understood me.

1940
01:57:54,647 --> 01:57:57,241
You never understood our friendship.

1941
01:57:58,084 --> 01:58:01,053
No matter how much
we fight, quarrel...

1942
01:58:01,488 --> 01:58:03,217
No matter how much we
mess with each other...

1943
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:06,424
But no outsider can do that.

1944
01:58:07,126 --> 01:58:09,094
You couldn't
understand such a small thing.

1945
01:58:10,597 --> 01:58:12,064
Give it to me,
brother. I will sign it.

1946
01:58:21,007 --> 01:58:22,975
Distribute whatever is
left among these poor guys.

1947
01:58:23,443 --> 01:58:24,569
Listen.

1948
01:58:26,279 --> 01:58:30,375
The Rs. 8 crores that you
are giving isn't a favour.

1949
01:58:31,551 --> 01:58:32,745
You had taken money on credit.

1950
01:58:34,087 --> 01:58:35,247
This isn't alms.

1951
01:58:36,089 --> 01:58:38,114
It belongs to me and you
are giving it back. Got it?

1952
01:58:41,327 --> 01:58:42,589
And listen without turning back...

1953
01:58:43,563 --> 01:58:46,054
Don't turn back, give
a look like a hero...

1954
01:58:46,132 --> 01:58:47,599
...once you reach outside the door.

1955
01:58:48,034 --> 01:58:50,298
Otherwise, the door
will close forever.

1956
01:58:50,770 --> 01:58:52,294
Got it? Go.

1957
01:58:52,505 --> 01:58:54,666
Go. Go.
- What are you thinking about?

1958
01:58:54,807 --> 01:58:56,468
Are you waiting for
his daughter's wedding?

1959
01:58:57,076 --> 01:58:58,134
Come on, let's leave.

1960
01:59:48,595 --> 01:59:52,087
Mr. Mittal, don't break off
this marriage and leave. - What?

1961
01:59:52,165 --> 01:59:55,191
Uncle Mittal, whatever happened
was our fault. Not Nikhil's.

1962
01:59:55,368 --> 01:59:56,665
And we are extremely sorry for that.

1963
01:59:56,803 --> 02:00:01,638
But please, don't punish
Anjali and Nikhil for our mistake.

1964
02:00:02,675 --> 02:00:03,733
Please.

1965
02:00:08,214 --> 02:00:10,375
These are some share certificates.

1966
02:00:11,451 --> 02:00:14,579
What? - Compensation for
whatever loss you have suffered.

1967
02:00:15,388 --> 02:00:17,686
Please, uncle. Please don't say no.

1968
02:00:17,757 --> 02:00:20,453
Uncle, please.

1969
02:00:26,232 --> 02:00:27,358
Where is he?

1970
02:00:28,334 --> 02:00:29,426
He is the groom.
He is getting ready.

1971
02:00:29,502 --> 02:00:30,628
Don't you want to get married?

1972
02:00:35,842 --> 02:00:37,503
Madam, where are you going?

1973
02:00:37,777 --> 02:00:39,039
Rajveer, let me go.

1974
02:00:39,112 --> 02:00:40,579
For the time being, you
will have to come with me.

1975
02:00:41,047 --> 02:00:43,345
But... - Just a minute, Anjali. -
But, Rajveer, I want to meet Nikhil.

1976
02:00:48,054 --> 02:00:50,352
Sorry, this isn't Ravi
Shankar Jaiswal's dress.

1977
02:00:51,724 --> 02:00:53,282
No. It's beautiful.

1978
02:00:53,459 --> 02:00:54,517
You know Anjali...

1979
02:00:56,129 --> 02:00:58,461
...there was a time I was
completely against this wedding.

1980
02:00:59,532 --> 02:01:03,093
I kept telling Nikhil,
do whatever you want.

1981
02:01:03,169 --> 02:01:04,261
Do it and finish the job.

1982
02:01:04,704 --> 02:01:06,365
Sorry for my language.

1983
02:01:09,008 --> 02:01:10,134
But I was wrong.

1984
02:01:12,578 --> 02:01:14,808
You know, Rajveer, the
act that you put up...

1985
02:01:15,248 --> 02:01:16,613
...that you care a darn for anyone...

1986
02:01:18,017 --> 02:01:19,211
It is all utter nonsense.

1987
02:01:19,452 --> 02:01:22,683
What you are doing today
is your real character.

1988
02:01:26,125 --> 02:01:27,217
Thanks, Rajveer.

1989
02:01:34,333 --> 02:01:35,800
I am so happy.

1990
02:01:38,371 --> 02:01:39,565
Love you.

1991
02:01:40,273 --> 02:01:41,535
You are looking beautiful.

1992
02:01:41,774 --> 02:01:43,071
Have a look.

1993
02:01:44,077 --> 02:01:46,238
What is this?
- Brother Rajveer told me to do so.

1994
02:01:46,312 --> 02:01:48,303
First pinch and then give this.

1995
02:01:49,215 --> 02:01:50,375
Okay.

1996
02:01:55,822 --> 02:01:58,256
Hey. Come. Come here.
- Hey, what are you doing?

1997
02:01:58,624 --> 02:02:02,116
What way is this? You used
50 new tricks while flirting.

1998
02:02:02,195 --> 02:02:04,129
And you completely
goof-up while proposing.

1999
02:02:04,197 --> 02:02:05,562
Goof-up? But...

2000
02:02:05,631 --> 02:02:07,189
Listen, Rajveer,
let's do this nicely.

2001
02:02:07,433 --> 02:02:08,661
Come on, get down on your knees.

2002
02:02:09,202 --> 02:02:10,567
Knees?
- Get down on your knees. Come on.

2003
02:02:10,636 --> 02:02:12,331
Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Sneha, someone might see us.

2004
02:02:12,405 --> 02:02:13,702
Rajveer, why are
you thinking so much?

2005
02:02:13,773 --> 02:02:15,673
Someone might see us.
- Get down on your knees. Come on.

2006
02:02:17,310 --> 02:02:18,436
Hold this.

2007
02:02:19,045 --> 02:02:20,205
What is this?
- Rakhi (brother-sister bond).

2008
02:02:20,379 --> 02:02:21,505
A ring.

2009
02:02:22,115 --> 02:02:23,480
A ring?
- You sent it.

2010
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:27,083
Me? - Rajveer! - Just a minute.
Just a minute.

2011
02:02:28,755 --> 02:02:30,017
I didn't send any ring.

2012
02:02:30,323 --> 02:02:32,257
You are just too much. - I agree
that you didn't send this ring.

2013
02:02:32,558 --> 02:02:33,752
But you had at least put it on her.
- Aarav.

2014
02:02:35,795 --> 02:02:39,561
If you can send flowers
for me, can't I send a ring?

2015
02:02:39,766 --> 02:02:41,495
This...
- Me.

2016
02:02:43,069 --> 02:02:44,127
You guys.

2017
02:02:44,203 --> 02:02:48,537
By the power vested in me, I
now pronounce you, man and wife.

2018
02:02:49,175 --> 02:02:50,267
Kiss the bride.

2019
02:02:50,443 --> 02:02:51,637
Listen. Listen.

2020
02:02:53,813 --> 02:02:55,280
You know what?

2021
02:02:56,749 --> 02:02:58,239
Just off.

2022
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:16,295
Stop. Stop.
- Stop.

2023
02:03:18,404 --> 02:03:19,496
Have you come with
the wedding procession?

2024
02:03:19,572 --> 02:03:21,335
Or are you here to get some
charity? - Is this how a...

2025
02:03:21,407 --> 02:03:25,138
...wedding procession looks like?
There is no band, no song, no music.

2026
02:03:36,355 --> 02:03:38,585
We are crazy about your beauty.

2027
02:03:38,658 --> 02:03:41,092
Let us come in.

2028
02:03:50,469 --> 02:03:52,460
Go away, Romeo.

2029
02:03:52,538 --> 02:03:55,098
We have seen many like you.

2030
02:04:03,783 --> 02:04:06,183
We are crazy about your beauty.

2031
02:04:06,252 --> 02:04:08,618
Let us come in.

2032
02:04:08,688 --> 02:04:10,747
Go away, Romeo.

2033
02:04:10,990 --> 02:04:13,424
We have seen many like you.

2034
02:04:22,635 --> 02:04:26,765
Let me be in your arms.

2035
02:04:27,006 --> 02:04:31,773
For eternity.

2036
02:04:41,187 --> 02:04:45,055
Life feels like
heaven in your arms.

2037
02:04:45,124 --> 02:04:46,819
Now I will take you away.

2038
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:49,453
Now I will take you away.

2039
02:04:49,528 --> 02:04:51,792
Now I will take you away.

2040
02:04:52,098 --> 02:04:54,726
Now I will take you away.

2041
02:05:18,324 --> 02:05:20,087
Son... - What is wrong with him?
- What are you doing?

2042
02:05:21,227 --> 02:05:22,751
Nikhil.
- Give him a divorce.

2043
02:05:23,796 --> 02:05:25,320
Listen.

2044
02:05:25,398 --> 02:05:27,025
I have never got a girl.

2045
02:05:27,099 --> 02:05:28,760
I am 28 years old and still single.

2046
02:05:30,603 --> 02:05:32,400
Are you proposing to me?

2047
02:05:32,571 --> 02:05:33,799
I didn't tell you?
- No.

2048
02:05:34,106 --> 02:05:35,300
That's what I have been
trying to do since so long.

2049
02:05:38,144 --> 02:05:39,270
You won't run away, will you?

2050
02:05:40,313 --> 02:05:41,439
You won't scold me?

2051
02:05:48,521 --> 02:05:50,148
I had never even in
my dreams thought...

2052
02:05:51,457 --> 02:05:53,186
...that I will fall
in love with someone.

2053
02:05:57,263 --> 02:05:58,389
Sneha.

2054
02:05:59,598 --> 02:06:00,622
Father.

2055
02:06:02,134 --> 02:06:03,226
Father is also here?

2056
02:06:04,170 --> 02:06:05,398
This is a great miracle.

2057
02:06:13,746 --> 02:06:14,974
Father.

2058
02:06:29,729 --> 02:06:33,529
Doomed!

2059
02:07:22,081 --> 02:07:25,312
You are my life, dear.

2060
02:07:25,384 --> 02:07:28,547
I've given my heart to you, dear.

2061
02:07:28,687 --> 02:07:32,020
You are my life, dear.

2062
02:07:32,258 --> 02:07:35,284
I've given my heart to you, dear.

2063
02:07:35,461 --> 02:07:38,589
You make the world smile.

2064
02:07:39,031 --> 02:07:42,023
Happiness lies in you.

2065
02:07:42,234 --> 02:07:48,139
Whatever you say
calms my heart down.

2066
02:07:48,207 --> 02:07:51,370
I keep chanting your name.

2067
02:07:51,444 --> 02:07:54,641
I keep you close to my heart.

2068
02:07:54,780 --> 02:08:01,447
I stop breathing
when I think of you.

2069
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:04,683
I keep chanting your name.

2070
02:08:04,757 --> 02:08:08,056
I keep you close to my heart.

2071
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:15,089
I stop breathing
when I think of you.

2072
02:08:28,714 --> 02:08:35,381
My thoughts stay occupied by you.

2073
02:08:35,521 --> 02:08:42,154
My desire has brought
me close to your desire.

2074
02:08:45,531 --> 02:08:52,164
My thoughts stay occupied by you.

2075
02:08:52,404 --> 02:08:58,604
My desire has brought
me close to your desire.

2076
02:08:58,677 --> 02:09:01,407
I keep chanting your name.

2077
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:04,677
I keep you close to my heart.

2078
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:11,679
I stop breathing
when I think of you.

2079
02:09:11,957 --> 02:09:14,949
I keep chanting your name.

2080
02:09:15,027 --> 02:09:18,155
I keep you close to my heart.

2081
02:09:18,230 --> 02:09:25,159
I stop breathing
when I think of you.

2082
02:09:25,337 --> 02:09:28,534
I keep chanting your name.

2083
02:09:28,674 --> 02:09:35,079
I keep chanting your name.
