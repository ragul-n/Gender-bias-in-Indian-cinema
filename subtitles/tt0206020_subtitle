1
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,819
- Pardon?
- You play the flute well.

2
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,140
- Thank you madam.
- What's your name?

3
00:04:56,211 --> 00:05:00,046
- Bansi.
- Do you live here?

4
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:03,509
See that hill? 10 hills
beyond that is my village.

5
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:09,855
An artist like you should be in
the city. You'll earn a lot.

6
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:14,056
- I'm scared of the city folk.
- Even me?

7
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:16,880
No. You don't seem like that.

8
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,460
- Do you always come here?
- Yes.

9
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:27,131
- I must be moving.
- One moment. Stand there.

10
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:31,400
- Why?
- Because I want to take your picture.

11
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:35,750
- But why?
- Because I'll cometo give it to you tomorrow.

12
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:39,955
You can play me a sweet tune then.

13
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:43,673
- All right.
- Then stand there.

14
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:54,915
"- Pinky, this boy..?
- He's Bansi."

15
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,962
The one whose flute I was
praising. He's very innocent.

16
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:02,578
He's smart not innocent?
And his name is Bunty not Bansi.

17
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,967
- Who is he? - Another college
has come for a tour from Bombay.

18
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,428
He's with them. He even
made a pass at me.

19
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:16,228
I saw him playing the flute
amongst those cows and buffaloes.

20
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:21,679
And you thought he's a villager?
I'll have to show you this boy.

21
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:29,022
I disguised myself as a villager so
I could flirt with a village belle.

22
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,029
But a city girl got caught?

23
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:36,554
I swear she was something?
What hair?

24
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:40,818
What eyes? What legs? Sexy?

25
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:45,976
She will come again tomorrow
to give me the picture?

26
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:48,951
Then I won't spare her.
I'll make her mine.

27
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:54,760
"I'm not worthy of my name Pinky,
if I don't make him taste mud?"

28
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,059
You were with the cows...

29
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:11,003
Where to? From a villager to
a track suit in one day?

30
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:18,310
"Since I saw a girl,
my heart goes..."

31
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:20,842
- Something happens...
- Exactly?

32
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:22,891
- A kind of tickling?
- Yes?

33
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,285
- And you can't sleep?
- Absolutely?

34
00:07:27,357 --> 00:07:31,137
- And your heart beats on seeing her?
- Great?

35
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,278
"
You are in love, aren't you?"

36
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,764
- Yes.
- Then tell her you love her.

37
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:43,408
"Tell her, not me,
that you love her?"

38
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:50,485
Oh my goodness?

39
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,045
What happened?

40
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:23,325
- The poor thing is hurt?
- Suits him fine.

41
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:25,757
At least he won't hurt
another girl's heart.

42
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:40,183
Bunty of George College and
K. Sundaram of Nehru College...

43
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,450
...were to play
a tennis match today.

44
00:12:42,518 --> 00:12:46,632
Bunty might not be able to play
this match due an arm injury.

45
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:56,207
- We declare K. Sundaram as the...
- Hold it.

46
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:04,255
I will play sir.

47
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:09,042
- But your arm?
- I'll play.

48
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:56,168
I'll be really happy when
Miss Pinky gives me the trophy.

49
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,453
Please come here.

50
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:18,329
Just an apology won't do.
You have to be punished too.

51
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:20,749
What punishment?

52
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:23,811
You'll have to join me for
a cup of tea in the evening.

53
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:35,053
- Speaking.
- Alok here.

54
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,395
My brother? How are you?

55
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:41,117
- Where are you calling from?
- From the village.

56
00:15:41,187 --> 00:15:43,603
- I'm coming tomorrow.
- You're coming tomorrow?

57
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:47,116
I'll come to the station?
And everyone will come with me.

58
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:49,224
The train arrives in the morning.
See you tomorrow.

59
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,938
- What's the matter?
- Sister? Alok is coming? My pal?

60
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,589
- Brother Alok is coming?
- Yes.

61
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:01,808
We'll be meeting after years?
It will be great?

62
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,061
I must go to the factory?
See you in the evening.

63
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:12,881
"- Tell me what's the matter.
- Asha, Alok is coming with Shobha."

64
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,163
Shobha too? It's been years
since we've seen her.

65
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:19,361
- She must have grown.
- Yes.

66
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:27,145
Fit to get married. Let Alok come.
I'll tell him...

67
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,705
to send her as a bride for our
son as soon as possible.

68
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:37,296
All that I possess today
is thanks to him.

69
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:41,384
Brother?

70
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:45,062
- My brother?
- How are you?

71
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:47,261
- Great. How are you?
- I'm fine.

72
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:51,249
You just called that
you're coming tomorrow.

73
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:57,480
Must have called from the
booth across. Still the prankster?

74
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:03,099
Your hair has grown gray but
your brain is still young.

75
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:09,094
- Is this Shobha?
- Yes. She's yours.

76
00:17:11,017 --> 00:17:12,290
May you live long?

77
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:22,504
Pretty eyes?

78
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,059
Such lovely lips?

79
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:28,500
And a beautiful face. May you
be safe from evil eyes.

80
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:41,885
Bunty is not to be seen...
I too want to see my son-in-law.

81
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,106
He has gone to Goa with his friends
and college for a youth festival.

82
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:47,655
I'll show you his picture.

83
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:51,164
Look.

84
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:01,542
Do you know you are
exactly 5 minutes late?

85
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,966
Actually I should apologise.
You got hurt because of me.

86
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:12,554
I am sorry for that.

87
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,984
To tell you frankly...
I am stubborn and a bit hot tempered.

88
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:23,028
And a master of my own wishes.
It's the only negative aspect in me.

89
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:30,493
You're crazy. First you hurt me.
Then you give me flowers.

90
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,643
- You too fooled me as a villager.
- And you got fooled.

91
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:40,072
You pushed me down...
and insulted me before girls.

92
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:43,909
Don't remind me?
You remember your insult?

93
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:48,470
But what about fooling me?
And that trash you said to your pals?

94
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:50,225
- Look...
- I don't want to hear a word?

95
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,354
I was insulted in front of them?

96
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,840
You men are the same? God knows
what you think of yourselves?

97
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,110
- What do you girls think?
- What do you think?

98
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:09,949
- Did I hurt you?
- Yes... here.

99
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:20,104
Our boy has his temper on his nose.

100
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:24,093
"- I mean, how will you two manage?
- With love."

101
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,785
You can even win an animal over
with love. And he's human.

102
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:33,767
- What do you think about the pair?
- Fire and ice makes a good pair.

103
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:40,631
"
Wait. Shobha, answer the call."

104
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:44,812
"- Me? - Yes, consider this
your own house."

105
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,117
- Where is the bomb?
- It's `Hi mom'.

106
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:56,402
We don't want bombs.
Wrong number.

107
00:19:57,971 --> 00:19:59,690
Sounded like a terrorist.

108
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,801
- Who's speaking?
- Who are you?

109
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:12,868
This is the daughter-in-law
of the house speaking.

110
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,096
- Speak louder.
- I'm the daughter-in-law?

111
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:17,307
Maid?

112
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:19,673
He thinks she's the maid?

113
00:20:19,806 --> 00:20:26,053
- Must be new. This is Bunty.
- Aunty? But you sound like an uncle.

114
00:20:27,307 --> 00:20:29,690
Fraud? You take me for a fraud?

115
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:36,012
- Give the phone to mother?
- Mother passed away long ago.

116
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:40,647
- What?
- My father never got married again.

117
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,630
"I'm talking about my mother,
not yours?"

118
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:50,191
- I'm Ajit Kumar's son?
- Good God?

119
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:54,211
- Aunt here.
- Aunt?

120
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:56,513
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

121
00:20:57,346 --> 00:21:01,297
- When did you employ this new maid?
- She's the daughter-in-law.

122
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:03,914
- What?
- Daughter-in-law.

123
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,630
I'm going to give everyone
a surprise.

124
00:21:06,796 --> 00:21:11,193
- Tell me now?
- No. The line isn't clear.

125
00:21:11,264 --> 00:21:13,626
I'll come home and tell you.

126
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:22,690
It wasn't aunty but Bunty.
Atul's pet name is Bunty.

127
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:31,114
I said daughter-in-law but because
of the disturbance he thought maid.

128
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:34,470
He said something about a surprise.

129
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:37,693
Let him come.
Now we'll surprise him.

130
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,146
You've brought me to the temple.
What is the objective behind this?

131
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,874
C'mon? Just come alomg.

132
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:55,089
Whoever wishes from his heart
before this image...

133
00:21:55,158 --> 00:22:00,839
"And throws a garland towards the
goddess, if it falls around her..."

134
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,930
- Their wish is fulfilled.
- Strange?

135
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:06,774
Don't tell me you believe this.

136
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:15,580
You may not believe it but I've
seen many wishes being fulfilled.

137
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:19,385
- Really?
- I've seen relations being formed.

138
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,174
Now I'll throw this garland
with your name in my mind.

139
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:50,569
It has never happened before
that one garland goes to another.

140
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:53,698
I'm sure this is a sign
of the Goddess.

141
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,842
"Sir, we've finished the
investigation in Goa."

142
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:30,568
We should return to Bombay.

143
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,769
- What are you thinking of?
- Nothing.

144
00:23:37,788 --> 00:23:39,507
Sing something with `h'.

145
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,816
Halt the ship.

146
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,493
Look at this.
It's called an RDX bomb.

147
00:28:42,072 --> 00:28:45,925
"As soon as I press the control
button, the ship will explode."

148
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,300
Sagar has captured the ship?

149
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:05,401
The life and death of
your men is in my hands?

150
00:29:05,472 --> 00:29:12,133
They'll blow to pieces with the ship.
You will be responsible for the loss.

151
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:18,518
"As we've demanded we should
get 50,000,000 within 5 hours."

152
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:24,330
I think we should give in
to their demand. Say what?

153
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:30,493
"Being a responsible officer, I can't
advice the law to bow before crime."

154
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:34,162
Finding them in 2 hours
is impossible?

155
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:37,455
I don't see any other option
but to give in to their demand.

156
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:39,275
"There is a way, sir."

157
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:42,235
There is?

158
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:46,229
I'll fulfil your dream.

159
00:29:47,322 --> 00:29:52,100
The government's hands and feet
would be cold because of your bomb.

160
00:29:53,068 --> 00:30:00,208
"And my sons would be bringing warm,
fresh notes from the Reserve bank."

161
00:30:01,783 --> 00:30:03,404
Whose boat is this?

162
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,325
"Hey fisherman, go away?"

163
00:30:28,821 --> 00:30:31,085
Who did that?

164
00:31:04,064 --> 00:31:06,611
"- You are on.
- Well, I'm one up on you."

165
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:13,125
I've got you and the ship covered?

166
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:14,267
What are you doing?

167
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,819
I'll fire one shot and
blast the whole ship?

168
00:31:22,898 --> 00:31:23,943
What have you done?

169
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,585
- Get out of here?
- I killed Sagar?

170
00:31:29,378 --> 00:31:31,283
- Hurry up?
- Hurry...

171
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:37,003
Welcome my lions?

172
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:42,556
They are my brave sons. They always
complete the job given to them.

173
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:43,801
Bravo?

174
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,103
Give the man his share of the loot.

175
00:31:56,736 --> 00:31:59,990
What's wrong? Why are you quiet?

176
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:06,500
Hiccups? Your hiccups are a bad omen?

177
00:32:06,568 --> 00:32:09,376
Has my plan been ruined?

178
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:12,239
How did this happen?

179
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:20,861
"Don't know Papu, but I know some of
our men were successful in escaping."

180
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:24,373
The rest were successful in dying.

181
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:30,120
"A fitting metaphor would be, ate
nothing, broke glass, paid cash?"

182
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:36,122
You are of no use to us? Our
business relationship is finished?

183
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:39,381
- Before that I'll finish you?
- Don't be foolish?

184
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:43,779
"lf you love shooting, use the bullet
on the one who ruined our plan?"

185
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:48,121
- Who was it?
- The cop's name is Arjun.

186
00:32:50,078 --> 00:32:53,169
What's wrong with you?
Why are you so furious?

187
00:32:53,366 --> 00:32:59,102
Of course I'll be angry?
What I did wasn't good.

188
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:04,211
- The city is praising you?
- That's abuse for me?

189
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,977
Not one of those men
was caught alive?

190
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,184
Or the whole gang would
be behind bars today?

191
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:17,084
- Why are you laughing?
- Since you wore this uniform..

192
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:21,196
You've forgotten this mother's
feelings. I too have desires.

193
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,365
I want to see you as a groom.

194
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:28,032
I've seen a girl for you.

195
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:35,694
Do you like her?
I'm asking you?

196
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:41,376
Yes. But find out her choice too.

197
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:45,330
I'll begin the marriage
preparations very soon.

198
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,220
You do that and I'll start
preparing to keep my promise.

199
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:51,137
- See you.
- Bye.

200
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:05,118
- He's come?
- How did you know I was coming?

201
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:06,714
I wanted to surprise you.

202
00:34:09,852 --> 00:34:13,041
We're going to surprise you.

203
00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:15,655
- What?
- We've fixed your marriage.

204
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:20,120
My marriage? Without knowing
my choice? You must be joking.

205
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,881
"- Mother..?
- Yes, son."

206
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:37,491
May I know the reason
for your silence?

207
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,571
Yes.

208
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:42,850
I have chosen a girl for myself.
And I'm going to marry her.

209
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,534
But I have promised my friend.

210
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:49,240
- Even I have given a promise.
- I gave him my word 15 years ago?

211
00:34:49,404 --> 00:34:51,287
When you didn't know its meaning?

212
00:34:51,415 --> 00:34:56,454
In 2 days that girl cast a spell
on you and you gave her this right?

213
00:34:56,586 --> 00:35:00,286
Don't we have any right over you?

214
00:35:02,907 --> 00:35:04,691
All right. Doesn't matter?

215
00:35:04,822 --> 00:35:07,946
But my friend has a right?

216
00:35:08,078 --> 00:35:10,755
Thanks to him you are
standing under this roof?

217
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:14,868
In your childhood we'd
decided to marry you to her?

218
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:17,135
- Decisions can be changed.
- Never?

219
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:20,810
You are our son? You have
to obey our decisions?

220
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:24,132
Why are you punishing me
for being your son?

221
00:35:24,263 --> 00:35:27,484
Are you in your senses? Have
we spoilt you so much that...

222
00:35:27,615 --> 00:35:29,520
You forget you're
talking to your Dad?

223
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:32,520
What do you want? I should meekly
accept your decision?

224
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,316
Stop it? I want to hear you agree?

225
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:42,608
- I can't forget her.
- Then forget us?

226
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:46,632
And we'll forget you.
The decision is in your hands.

227
00:35:58,643 --> 00:36:01,255
I see. This is the situation.

228
00:36:02,921 --> 00:36:07,318
"Pinky in the right, Shobha in the
left, Papa ahead, Mummy behind."

229
00:36:07,454 --> 00:36:09,587
- You are trapped.
- Yes aunt.

230
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,016
I had thought l'd
convince Daddy about Pinky.

231
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:16,511
But he wants to tie me to
that Shobha? But I want Pinky?

232
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:23,478
There's a difference in attachment
and love. Meet Shobha once and...

233
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:26,669
- Do you want me to leave?
- Hey wait?

234
00:36:27,629 --> 00:36:32,734
In 15 days Pinky cast such a spell
that you don't want to see Shobha.

235
00:36:34,077 --> 00:36:38,703
- What's so special about her?
- Meet her and you'll forget Shobha.

236
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:43,101
What style? What gait? What eyes?

237
00:36:43,238 --> 00:36:45,785
What a figure?
What a sense of dressing?

238
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,761
I agree.
Dress sense is terrific?

239
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:55,104
"Tell me honestly, after hearing
me, what do you think of Pinky?"

240
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:59,160
Pinky and Shobha are poles apart.

241
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:05,355
Pinky has a style of living and
Shobha the same old culture.

242
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:11,926
Pinky's eyes are beautiful while
Shobha wears thick glasses?

243
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,508
One is the meek goddess of wealth
the other is Goddess of wars?

244
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:20,393
One will smear her forehead with
the dust of her husband's feet.

245
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:27,001
The other will dust the dirt
off her husband's clothes?

246
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:32,111
How can you introduce a wife
like Shobha to your friends?

247
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,878
You understand my
inner emotions so well?

248
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:41,232
And I've given her my word.

249
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:45,255
"Your parents too have given
their word, so have you."

250
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:52,412
Let's go and see if Pinky's
Dad has given anyone his word.

251
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,979
I am Bunty. And this is my aunt.

252
00:37:56,756 --> 00:38:00,196
I see. Don't be scared. Sit down.

253
00:38:05,598 --> 00:38:09,517
- I'm his aunt and this is Bunty.
- So?

254
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:14,688
"- You see, I am Bunty...
- I know. And you're his aunt."

255
00:38:14,824 --> 00:38:16,130
Absolutely right.

256
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:22,226
You can trust me. I won't give
you any cause for complaint.

257
00:38:23,347 --> 00:38:27,744
Trust...complaint?
What do you want?

258
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:31,961
I've come in regard to marriage.

259
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:36,586
What nonsense is this?
Are you in your senses?

260
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:39,531
Yes. We only want you to agree.

261
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,569
I love my dead wife very much.

262
00:38:44,704 --> 00:38:47,925
"You are pretty,
but I can't marry you?"

263
00:38:50,513 --> 00:38:53,953
I'm not talking of my marriage?
I've come for Bunty?

264
00:38:54,088 --> 00:38:56,123
"To ask for your one and only
daughter, Pinky."

265
00:38:56,994 --> 00:38:59,954
They love each other.

266
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:05,546
"- Doesn't he have parents?
- He does, but they're not in favour."

267
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,464
As his aunt I had to come.

268
00:39:12,157 --> 00:39:13,615
What happens after
the marriage is fixed?

269
00:39:13,753 --> 00:39:17,965
We'll get them married in court.

270
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:25,881
- After that? - His father
will throw him out of the house.

271
00:39:26,011 --> 00:39:31,464
"Once on the roads, he'll
learn to slog and feed himself."

272
00:39:31,597 --> 00:39:36,027
- You mean he doesn't work?
- So what? He'll do it.

273
00:39:36,163 --> 00:39:39,123
"And if he can't, he'll
live with his father-in-law."

274
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:44,611
You can give your daughter's
hand in his blindfolded.

275
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:49,887
You won't find a son-in-law like
my Bunty in the whole world?

276
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:56,400
"She's my daughter, not a goat
that I can tie to any lamp post?"

277
00:39:56,529 --> 00:39:58,978
"- Colonel, there's some confusion...
- Get out?"

278
00:40:03,073 --> 00:40:06,741
Fine. Let's go?
We'll have tea at home?

279
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,437
- What have you done?
- I was testing him.

280
00:40:13,575 --> 00:40:18,865
Will he help his son-in-law or not?
But he turned out to be a miser.

281
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,706
"- You, here?
- Yes."

282
00:40:24,844 --> 00:40:27,326
- And who is she?
- She's my paternal aunt.

283
00:40:30,015 --> 00:40:32,878
So this is your choice?

284
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:38,851
- Yes. How do you find her?
- Very.. very nice.

285
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:44,467
But what's the use?
Her father turned you down.

286
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:48,362
- What?
- Didn't even offer us tea.

287
00:40:48,499 --> 00:40:49,837
Insulted and threw us out?

288
00:40:50,606 --> 00:40:53,021
Let's go.

289
00:40:55,298 --> 00:40:57,181
- Now what will we do?
- What can we do?

290
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:01,292
Why did you behave this way
with Bunty and his aunt?

291
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:06,180
I did what's in your best interest.

292
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:10,708
You shouldn't have insulted them.
Bunty is a nice boy.

293
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:15,470
You're speaking for a boy
who wants to live off me?

294
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,456
"- That lazy bum won't keep you happy.
- But, papa l... "

295
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:25,267
- I love him.
- Don't try to take advantage of me.

296
00:41:26,103 --> 00:41:27,822
I've chosen your husband.

297
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:31,240
Who is 1000 times better than him?

298
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:35,158
Who has his own identity?
You will only marry him?

299
00:41:39,574 --> 00:41:43,906
"- You insist on this.
- Yes, I do. And my decision too."

300
00:41:44,076 --> 00:41:46,622
I've decided we will be one?

301
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:53,168
Our parents oppose our relation. Our
love will bring them to their knees.

302
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:56,773
We'll leave this place and
create our own world faraway.

303
00:41:57,004 --> 00:42:02,358
Great? That's the right decision.
You must elope and get married.

304
00:42:02,494 --> 00:42:04,594
How much money do you have?

305
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:08,234
"At this moment, 1200."

306
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:12,323
- And in your purse?
- About 7 or 800.

307
00:42:12,455 --> 00:42:17,973
That's almost 2000? Fantastic?
That's a whole month's expenses.

308
00:42:18,105 --> 00:42:22,796
- That's one day's expenditure?
- It's not enough for my makeup?

309
00:42:22,925 --> 00:42:25,472
Yes. How else would you
look beautiful?

310
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:30,130
But who thinks about this
superficiality in love?

311
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:36,201
What could be the worst?
You won't get your parent's love?

312
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:40,794
There's nothing in their love.
And you love each other.

313
00:42:42,078 --> 00:42:46,225
"When you leave home, you'll
get a job earning 1200 bucks."

314
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:48,839
Look at that bus stop.

315
00:42:50,697 --> 00:42:53,244
Catch a bus from one such stop.

316
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:02,760
Give me a penny.
May your kids be happy.

317
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:05,628
Bless you?

318
00:43:09,213 --> 00:43:12,401
"When it will be over crowded,
you will get pushed around."

319
00:43:12,532 --> 00:43:14,666
Bear it for love's sake.

320
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,703
Your boss will scold you
if you reach office late.

321
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:27,849
It's better to be scolded by
the boss than by the parents.

322
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:34,680
Both of you reach home tired.
Though the bread be dry...

323
00:43:34,814 --> 00:43:37,045
Love will be there.

324
00:43:37,176 --> 00:43:40,430
- Is this bread?
- That's all there is. Eat it.

325
00:43:57,383 --> 00:44:00,060
Is this bread or rubber?

326
00:44:00,192 --> 00:44:02,129
"lf you don't like it,
order some from the hotel."

327
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,162
- I don't have money?
- Money? Money?

328
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,739
"lf you knew the importance of money,
we wouldn't be in this state?"

329
00:44:09,418 --> 00:44:12,606
You neither have a grand
house to live in...

330
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:15,034
Nor goodies to eat.

331
00:44:15,164 --> 00:44:18,472
But nothing matters
compared to love.

332
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:21,224
You have to forget the comforts.

333
00:44:34,637 --> 00:44:38,305
What are you saying?
We'll die without these?

334
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:42,832
Living without money these
days is very difficult.

335
00:44:43,256 --> 00:44:48,197
Isn't there some way whereby
we don't lose our luxuries too?

336
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:51,487
- There is one formula?
- What? - Tell us.

337
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:58,313
Get married where
your parents wish.

338
00:44:58,514 --> 00:44:58,764
- We're talking of our marriage..
- How can you say this? - One minute?

339
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:02,664
- Don't people take divorce?
- Divorce?

340
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:06,296
- Divorce?
- Yes. Now listen carefully.

341
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:10,959
Make the lives of your
spouses miserable?

342
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:16,508
Trouble them so much that
they ask you for divorce?

343
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:21,588
"Tell your parents, we tried living
your way and see our condition?"

344
00:45:21,722 --> 00:45:25,390
Now we'll live life our way.
Then you can get married?

345
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:27,555
What an idea?

346
00:45:35,161 --> 00:45:37,773
This bastard has made
our lives miserable?

347
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:43,835
He is neither tempted by our
money nor scared by our power.

348
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:47,832
Can't understand how to tackle him.

349
00:45:50,995 --> 00:45:53,411
I have an answer to such an officer.

350
00:45:54,762 --> 00:45:56,862
I'll tail him like a shadow.

351
00:45:58,145 --> 00:46:01,966
And I'll kill him like a dog
as soon as I get the chance.

352
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:08,991
Even if I have to play
with blood for it?

353
00:46:13,948 --> 00:46:15,982
Our marriage has been fixed.

354
00:46:16,118 --> 00:46:19,307
Still I want to know
if you accept this match.

355
00:46:24,003 --> 00:46:25,145
Answer me.

356
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,869
Don't people take divorce
after marriage?

357
00:46:37,091 --> 00:46:38,038
Yes.

358
00:46:38,751 --> 00:46:43,475
But I want to say something.
I'm a very broad-minded girl.

359
00:46:44,689 --> 00:46:45,962
And I'm a police officer.

360
00:46:46,955 --> 00:46:51,255
I put criminals behind bars
not my wife's freedom.

361
00:46:54,393 --> 00:46:55,372
All right.

362
00:46:55,510 --> 00:47:00,071
"lf you've finished,
may I talk to my would-be son-in-law?"

363
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,523
I've raised Pinky like a
mother as well as father.

364
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:16,031
You can understand
what I mean to say.

365
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:24,741
I promise I'll never
let her be harmed.

366
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:27,207
Neither by sorrows
nor circumstances.

367
00:47:29,188 --> 00:47:32,247
Do you know why l
chose you for Pinky?

368
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:36,143
Because you're the only man...

369
00:47:36,275 --> 00:47:40,542
who can ignore her mischief
and foolishness.

370
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,969
Aunt?

371
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:53,577
- What are you doing here?
- I married because you said.

372
00:53:53,715 --> 00:53:57,861
That is good. Be happy.
Shobha is a nice girl.

373
00:53:58,029 --> 00:54:00,247
Don't rub it in.

374
00:54:00,383 --> 00:54:04,918
Tell me a formula by which
she runs away today itself?

375
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:08,520
You mean hatred formula?

376
00:54:10,516 --> 00:54:16,067
"Now when you go to the room,
she'd be sitting shy under a veil."

377
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,404
Don't you dare lift the veil?

378
00:54:19,538 --> 00:54:25,056
"Say I'm going? She'll ask
My lord, where are you going?"

379
00:54:25,194 --> 00:54:27,868
Say you're going
to a cabaret dancer?

380
00:54:28,004 --> 00:54:30,055
Put your foot out and laugh.

381
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:38,133
"She'll hold your leg and sing,
don't leave my arms and go beloved."

382
00:54:38,268 --> 00:54:41,790
No? Shobha you please go away?

383
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,318
Listen.

384
00:55:23,672 --> 00:55:26,347
Go to sleep. I'm going out.

385
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,060
I'm going out.

386
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:32,683
Didn't you hear? I'm going out!

387
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:34,840
Sure.

388
00:55:36,225 --> 00:55:40,471
- Won't you ask where? - I know
you love getting wet in the rain.

389
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,546
I'm not going to get wet!
I'm going to a cabaret dancer.

390
00:55:43,711 --> 00:55:46,352
Cadbury chocolate? I love Cadbury!
One for me too!

391
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:51,057
Not the chocolate. The dancer!

392
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:54,717
But why are you dancing?
Is your foot sprained?

393
00:55:54,857 --> 00:56:01,980
This is fun. What would you village
belles know? They are fairies!

394
00:56:02,114 --> 00:56:06,683
- They show their legs!
- How much? This much...

395
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,958
Yes.

396
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,825
"No. Cover it, I say!"

397
00:56:10,057 --> 00:56:14,404
"They embrace you, sit in your lap!
It's such fun!"

398
00:56:14,536 --> 00:56:15,973
What else do they do?

399
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:20,417
- Don't you feel something on
hearing this? - Of course.

400
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,158
- What?
- I enjoy it.

401
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:26,004
- Enjoy it?
- What else do they do?

402
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,105
"My head! Aunt, where have you
trapped me!"

403
00:56:29,278 --> 00:56:32,377
- I'm Shobha not aunt.
- I know!

404
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,932
Go to sleep. The cabaret girl
is waiting for me.

405
00:56:36,241 --> 00:56:40,097
- Wait. You can't leave like this.
- Why?

406
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:42,023
"l said, you can't leave."

407
00:56:42,157 --> 00:56:46,035
"""Say, `l am going to a cabaret dancer'
She'll hold your legs""."

408
00:56:46,178 --> 00:56:47,549
Take this along.

409
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:52,583
- Umbrella?
- Yes. It's raining.

410
00:56:52,716 --> 00:56:55,067
You'll get wet and
won't reach in time.

411
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:03,560
- Wait.
- Now what?

412
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:07,481
Give me your hand.

413
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:16,113
"ln our village when somebody goes
for a dance, they tie flowers."

414
00:57:16,252 --> 00:57:19,249
Come back in the morning.
I'll be waiting.

415
00:57:21,874 --> 00:57:22,843
Go on.

416
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,780
Aunt!

417
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,612
You already know that
I'm a broad-minded girl.

418
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:36,362
I'm accustomed to going
to the disco every night.

419
00:59:36,496 --> 00:59:41,133
I'm going to the Golden disco where
my friends are waiting for me.

420
00:59:41,263 --> 00:59:43,151
You too can join us.

421
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,647
"By the way, happy first night."

422
00:59:54,288 --> 00:59:57,735
This is that rascal
Arjun's newly wedded wife.

423
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:01,353
Get the bitch!

424
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:12,587
I'm not used to being turned down.

425
01:02:11,947 --> 01:02:13,736
- Take him away.
- Come on!

426
01:02:16,652 --> 01:02:17,764
Shall we leave?

427
01:02:27,051 --> 01:02:28,774
May I know the reason for this?

428
01:02:29,387 --> 01:02:33,511
I had told you that
I'm very broad-minded.

429
01:02:33,643 --> 01:02:35,912
That doesn't mean you
forget your culture.

430
01:02:37,514 --> 01:02:41,606
"You've come to this house as
a daughter-in-law, my wife."

431
01:02:41,738 --> 01:02:44,586
I would want you to remain within
the limits of this marital symbol.

432
01:02:44,906 --> 01:02:49,314
This chain is not a dog collar.

433
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:52,384
And I'll wag my tail for you!

434
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:59,553
Don't dishonour it by
calling it a dog collar.

435
01:02:59,689 --> 01:03:02,537
Try to understand this pure relation.

436
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:06,408
Don't forget we've walked around
the sacred fire with each other.

437
01:03:07,786 --> 01:03:13,383
All I want to tell you is that
this is a pure chord between us.

438
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:16,386
Take care of it.

439
01:03:22,601 --> 01:03:26,463
The game has just begun.
We'll wait for the end.

440
01:03:28,745 --> 01:03:31,679
- What is it?
- Ashu has been caught!

441
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,616
Read this. Arjun Shroff nabbed him.

442
01:03:47,113 --> 01:03:50,691
This means lnspector Arjun will
get everything out of Ashu.

443
01:03:52,617 --> 01:03:55,366
Any moment the police can come here.

444
01:03:57,288 --> 01:03:59,590
We must leave this place fast.

445
01:04:00,296 --> 01:04:04,071
- Where will we go?
- Rascal! Hiccup again!

446
01:04:05,288 --> 01:04:06,881
- I'm off for duty.
- Have breakfast.

447
01:04:06,952 --> 01:04:09,319
- No mother.
- Take this.

448
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:13,791
Tomorrow I'm going to Khandala
for a case. I'll be back in few days.

449
01:04:15,592 --> 01:04:20,032
You haven't taken your wife
anywhere since you got married.

450
01:04:20,167 --> 01:04:23,582
"Since you are going,
take her along."

451
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:26,975
"But I'm going on duty,
not on a picnic."

452
01:04:27,112 --> 01:04:30,275
Your duty is for 8 hours.
What will you do after that?

453
01:04:35,815 --> 01:04:39,263
All right mother. Be ready
to leave tomorrow morning.

454
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:44,450
It's too much!

455
01:04:44,518 --> 01:04:47,333
- The water has reached my neck!
- Drink some water.

456
01:04:47,462 --> 01:04:49,884
What joke is this?
I can't stay one day with Shobha!

457
01:04:50,023 --> 01:04:54,594
"- I want Pinky!
- Even as a kid, you were like this."

458
01:04:54,726 --> 01:04:56,865
I want chocolate!

459
01:04:56,998 --> 01:04:59,485
And you'd pat me to sleep.
But now I'm no kid.

460
01:04:59,622 --> 01:05:04,291
"l want what I want!
If I don't get it, you beware!"

461
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:07,999
"What can you do, poor thing?"

462
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:11,451
You can neither leave
the house nor stay hungry.

463
01:05:11,653 --> 01:05:13,955
Nor commit suicide.

464
01:05:14,694 --> 01:05:17,214
Do you drink whisky or beer?

465
01:05:17,382 --> 01:05:23,427
- I'm asking for the formula and..
- Fool! That's what I mean.

466
01:05:23,557 --> 01:05:26,874
Pretend to drink liquor
in front of Shobha.

467
01:05:27,013 --> 01:05:30,941
She's a villager who
thinks wine is poison.

468
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:35,682
She will cry and beg
you to stop drinking.

469
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:37,188
That's what you said earlier.

470
01:05:37,317 --> 01:05:40,448
But she gave me an umbrella
instead of falling at my feet!

471
01:05:40,741 --> 01:05:43,708
That was the first step towards hate.

472
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,779
It means the embers
have been ignited.

473
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:53,307
Now when you pull her
hair in drunkenness...

474
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:57,155
- And throw her out of the room
- I'll be the villain for her!

475
01:05:57,444 --> 01:05:59,583
- From hero to villain.
- Yes.

476
01:05:59,652 --> 01:06:01,824
That trick first and now this.

477
01:06:01,957 --> 01:06:04,029
Then no trick. Just divorce.

478
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:07,009
Then marital night with Pinky.

479
01:06:08,004 --> 01:06:09,630
Pinky will be dressed as a bride.

480
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:13,472
And only Pinky and me.

481
01:06:15,716 --> 01:06:17,472
What are you doing?

482
01:06:17,604 --> 01:06:20,768
- Drinking.
- I won't let you drink!

483
01:06:20,996 --> 01:06:25,469
- Who are you to stop me?
- You've never considered me a wife.

484
01:06:25,604 --> 01:06:28,899
But I've considered you my
husband for many births.

485
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:33,567
Promise me that you'll
never touch this again.

486
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:40,219
"l can leave you, but not the drink."

487
01:06:40,547 --> 01:06:43,035
"Please don't, I beseech you!"

488
01:06:43,172 --> 01:06:45,724
- Give it up.
- Let go!

489
01:06:52,323 --> 01:06:54,690
Neat drinks are very bad.

490
01:06:56,835 --> 01:06:58,624
Add a little soda to it.

491
01:06:59,747 --> 01:07:01,273
Little ice.

492
01:07:01,411 --> 01:07:05,120
"And I'll get you some eats,
I mean fried cashew."

493
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:08,000
That would taste lovely. Right?

494
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:09,400
In a jiffy!

495
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:40,380
What's wrong?

496
01:07:43,874 --> 01:07:47,485
- Tell me what's wrong.
- I can't bear anymore!

497
01:07:47,617 --> 01:07:50,300
- I can't take it anymore!
- Tell me what it is.

498
01:07:51,265 --> 01:07:55,999
"Right from the wedding day, I over
looked everything he did as a joke."

499
01:07:56,129 --> 01:08:01,115
But today he is destroying
himself to hurt me.

500
01:08:01,249 --> 01:08:06,584
I can't express how my heart
aches seeing him passed out.

501
01:08:06,752 --> 01:08:11,738
Even my heart cries out seeing it.

502
01:08:13,633 --> 01:08:18,335
But even tears do not
stand by a crying person.

503
01:08:18,464 --> 01:08:20,635
They fall off the eyes.

504
01:08:24,736 --> 01:08:31,512
"Before Pinky snatches your husband
away, you must own him."

505
01:08:32,672 --> 01:08:34,777
You must face every demand of his.

506
01:08:36,127 --> 01:08:39,957
Someday he will accept
defeat from his demands.

507
01:08:41,344 --> 01:08:45,850
That is why I had advised
you to pretend innocence.

508
01:08:45,983 --> 01:08:51,417
But he is not pretending.
Today he is really drunk!

509
01:08:51,935 --> 01:08:54,870
Liquor ruins homes.

510
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:59,034
Do you think I'll let
your home be ruined?

511
01:09:03,999 --> 01:09:05,308
Pinky here.

512
01:09:08,383 --> 01:09:12,855
- Is Bunty at home?
- No. But what's wrong?

513
01:09:12,991 --> 01:09:18,174
- Have you forgotten your formula?
- Oh! The divorce formula?

514
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:23,227
Arjun and I are going to Khandala
tomorrow. Ask Bunty to come there.

515
01:09:23,455 --> 01:09:26,236
- Where will you stay?
- In the police quarters.

516
01:09:26,367 --> 01:09:30,076
"- Send him there.
- Sure, I will."

517
01:09:32,861 --> 01:09:34,650
What a girl!

518
01:09:35,645 --> 01:09:40,086
She's going with her husband
but has called Bunty too.

519
01:09:41,405 --> 01:09:44,537
Only such brave girls
can do anything in life.

520
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:50,780
"lf she can play such tricks for her
lover, can't you for your husband?"

521
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:55,666
I will. I'll do just anything
to gain my husband's love.

522
01:10:05,373 --> 01:10:06,747
What have you done?

523
01:10:07,901 --> 01:10:11,545
There was an eclipse on the face
of the moon. I took it away.

524
01:10:15,389 --> 01:10:17,626
One bag is mine. The other..?

525
01:10:17,757 --> 01:10:23,158
Shobha's. What did you think?
You would go there alone?

526
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:24,980
But mother...

527
01:10:25,116 --> 01:10:31,259
- Aunt say something.
- Whatever we do is for your benefit.

528
01:10:31,388 --> 01:10:34,966
And Shobha can see our
farmhouse this way.

529
01:11:10,587 --> 01:11:11,535
Shall we?

530
01:11:13,371 --> 01:11:14,200
Sure.

531
01:11:14,331 --> 01:11:17,713
Take this along. You'll feel cold.

532
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,237
- Shall we?
- Sure.

533
01:25:16,707 --> 01:25:20,481
- What are you looking for?
- I can't find my wedding necklace.

534
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:23,360
I've been searching for long.
I can't recall where I kept it.

535
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:26,235
- So buy another.
- No.

536
01:25:26,370 --> 01:25:30,232
The wedding necklace my husband
put around my neck...

537
01:25:30,369 --> 01:25:32,987
in front of the sacred fire...
Nothing can substitute for it.

538
01:25:33,122 --> 01:25:36,122
- My heart is sinking. If l
don't find it... - Don't be upset.

539
01:25:37,057 --> 01:25:38,683
- Who are you?
- I'm lnspector Arjun.

540
01:25:39,106 --> 01:25:41,081
Please come in.

541
01:25:45,058 --> 01:25:46,006
Hello.

542
01:25:48,897 --> 01:25:50,687
I've come to return
your wedding necklace.

543
01:25:52,225 --> 01:25:54,844
I found it in my jeep.
Keep it safe.

544
01:25:55,778 --> 01:25:57,338
It shouldn't come back to me.

545
01:25:58,977 --> 01:26:03,832
Thanks for returning it. God would
have granted me anything today.

546
01:26:03,968 --> 01:26:04,950
Enough!

547
01:26:05,857 --> 01:26:10,494
That's the limit. I can't bear to
see you making merry with strangers!

548
01:26:10,753 --> 01:26:14,876
You are mistaken.
He's come to return this.

549
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,968
How did it land in his jeep?
What were you doing with...?

550
01:26:22,496 --> 01:26:25,496
All this while I thought
you had filthy intentions.

551
01:26:25,664 --> 01:26:28,414
But now I know even
your language is filthy!

552
01:26:28,513 --> 01:26:31,382
So easily you used this filthy word!

553
01:26:31,552 --> 01:26:36,735
I came to return her wedding necklace.
Because I've learnt to give not loot!

554
01:26:44,928 --> 01:26:46,816
Listen...

555
01:26:46,944 --> 01:26:53,021
The husband who expects his
wife's character to be like Sita...

556
01:26:53,151 --> 01:26:56,316
That husband should try to
emulate his character to Ram.

557
01:27:17,534 --> 01:27:20,087
You forgot to add sugar.

558
01:27:20,222 --> 01:27:23,092
- I just did.
- Then why is it so weak?

559
01:27:29,887 --> 01:27:31,675
- The tea is sweet.
- Really?

560
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:38,266
Now it's really sweet.

561
01:27:38,397 --> 01:27:40,307
Because your lips touched it.

562
01:27:53,598 --> 01:27:56,632
- Don't you have to go to duty?
- My handkerchief.

563
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:17,304
- I want to meet you today.
- Anything special?

564
01:28:17,437 --> 01:28:23,253
Yes. I think Arjun and
Shobha are using our formula on us!

565
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:26,038
We must decide what to do.

566
01:28:26,237 --> 01:28:29,499
I'll meet you at 4 o'clock
in Hotel Eniga.

567
01:28:37,788 --> 01:28:39,032
"
Now what, aunt?"

568
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:42,908
We must use our formula over theirs.

569
01:28:43,036 --> 01:28:47,542
One up on them.
Call the police station.

570
01:28:48,092 --> 01:28:49,368
Make it fast.

571
01:28:50,332 --> 01:28:53,081
No way! I know Arjun very well.

572
01:28:53,212 --> 01:28:55,252
He won't even look at another woman.

573
01:28:55,388 --> 01:28:57,876
"
Believe me, he has his eye on Shobha!"

574
01:28:58,012 --> 01:29:01,973
Or why would he drop her home?
Shobha doesn't even know him!

575
01:29:02,108 --> 01:29:05,556
Maybe he's hitting us
with our own strategy.

576
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:22,585
I called you here.

577
01:29:23,227 --> 01:29:28,661
- You probably understand why?
- Yes.

578
01:29:29,339 --> 01:29:33,332
My heart doesn't agree for a drama.

579
01:29:33,466 --> 01:29:38,965
But... a woman can endure everything
but her husband with another woman.

580
01:29:42,042 --> 01:29:46,963
You are right. You want to
save your house and I mine.

581
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:50,164
- Then shall we?
- Sure.

582
01:29:55,802 --> 01:29:56,817
Have a seat.

583
01:29:58,362 --> 01:30:00,630
This pink saree you've worn
compares you to a pink rose.

584
01:30:01,882 --> 01:30:04,751
Now you see your husband's character!

585
01:30:12,185 --> 01:30:13,593
What's going on?

586
01:30:15,962 --> 01:30:19,344
Eating ice cream with other women
accounts for duty?

587
01:30:19,481 --> 01:30:21,521
Other women?
She's no stranger to me.

588
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:25,364
"What? Things have gone so far!
Did you hear that, Bunty?"

589
01:30:26,073 --> 01:30:30,296
- I didn't expect this from you!
- You? What are you doing here?

590
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,808
- Don't pretend..
- Talk to me.

591
01:30:33,945 --> 01:30:35,636
And you talk to me!

592
01:30:35,993 --> 01:30:38,097
What's going on? Who is she?

593
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:39,312
Who am l?

594
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:44,822
"Bunty, you've given her too
much freedom! She's crossing limits!"

595
01:30:44,952 --> 01:30:45,900
Come home.

596
01:30:50,008 --> 01:30:51,252
Here's yours.

597
01:30:51,384 --> 01:30:53,937
Sit down. Let's eat.
Then we'll go home.

598
01:30:54,808 --> 01:30:55,756
Come on.

599
01:31:03,096 --> 01:31:05,747
Since when has this illiterate
started saying bye?

600
01:31:05,879 --> 01:31:08,301
Eat the ice cream.
You'll cool down.

601
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:11,952
- That's not my taste.
- Change your taste. You'll be happy.

602
01:31:13,943 --> 01:31:15,350
What you're doing is wrong!

603
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:18,098
- You're saying this?
- Yes.

604
01:31:18,231 --> 01:31:20,914
I can't tolerate to see you
with another woman...

605
01:31:21,047 --> 01:31:22,705
- in a restaurant...
- What right do you have?

606
01:31:22,839 --> 01:31:27,573
- I'm your...!
- Wife. Say it.

607
01:31:31,607 --> 01:31:33,014
Say you're my wife.

608
01:32:49,364 --> 01:32:53,641
- Do I look like Shobha?
- I mean... this dress suits you.

609
01:32:55,731 --> 01:32:57,357
All right. Let's go.

610
01:33:06,131 --> 01:33:07,724
- Let them go.
- Let them pass.

611
01:33:38,067 --> 01:33:39,441
There's your wife.

612
01:33:40,242 --> 01:33:43,242
It's time up...
And there's your wife.

613
01:33:44,466 --> 01:33:47,314
That's how love should be.

614
01:33:47,443 --> 01:33:52,264
- Right. Where are you going?
- Come on. She is here.

615
01:33:52,403 --> 01:33:55,664
- I should greet...
- Be here. I'll look after her.

616
01:34:02,513 --> 01:34:04,171
Thanks for bringing
your sister-in-law here.

617
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:06,411
Sister-in-law? But she...

618
01:34:06,578 --> 01:34:11,662
You want to ask if
I've finished my duty?

619
01:34:12,369 --> 01:34:17,006
I'll take my wife home.
You go to your house.

620
01:34:25,746 --> 01:34:26,694
Sister-in-law!

621
01:34:31,058 --> 01:34:34,505
Won't you ask who that boy was?

622
01:34:36,241 --> 01:34:40,267
I'll tell you anyway.
He was my lover.

623
01:34:53,712 --> 01:34:56,527
Why did you marry me when you were
involved with someone?

624
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:02,793
Why did you give approval
when I asked your wish?

625
01:35:03,697 --> 01:35:07,690
This marriage took place
with your consent! Wasn't it?

626
01:35:07,824 --> 01:35:09,034
Answer me!

627
01:35:16,176 --> 01:35:18,543
This bond of this purity
of this marital chain...

628
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:23,460
That holds our relation together..
I ask what's the meaning of this?

629
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,283
Answer me!

630
01:35:31,183 --> 01:35:32,808
Enough!

631
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:40,645
If this is your answer after
playing with my honour and life..

632
01:35:40,782 --> 01:35:42,408
Hear my answer too.

633
01:35:43,438 --> 01:35:47,530
I will teach you the lesson of
love today for this pure bond.

634
01:35:57,006 --> 01:35:57,954
No!

635
01:36:17,806 --> 01:36:18,754
No! Please!

636
01:36:30,446 --> 01:36:32,388
I can't tolerate to see
with another woman...

637
01:36:32,526 --> 01:36:34,382
- in a restaurant...
- What right do you have?

638
01:36:34,382 --> 01:36:34,573
Now you are both tied in the
sanctity of marriage for life.

639
01:36:34,573 --> 01:36:36,428
- I'm your...!
- Wife. Say it.

640
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:38,342
Say you're my wife.

641
01:36:40,012 --> 01:36:42,126
But till your hearts meet
all these bonds are useless.

642
01:36:42,126 --> 01:36:46,119
Compromise? Accepted Arjun
as your husband?

643
01:36:46,221 --> 01:36:46,318
If I wished I could teach
you a lesson right now.

644
01:36:46,318 --> 01:36:49,613
- What's wrong in that?
- That's very wrong!

645
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:51,372
- No. I want to be faithful to him.
- Will you be a puppet for him?

646
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:55,496
But the minds have to meet
before the bodies do.

647
01:36:55,789 --> 01:36:57,325
You never bowed before anyone.
Will you do so today?

648
01:36:57,325 --> 01:37:00,749
And there's nothing but
treachery in your mind.

649
01:37:00,749 --> 01:37:02,317
You have to use Arjun
as a step to get Bunty.

650
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:04,397
It's my misfortune that
the girl I married..

651
01:37:04,397 --> 01:37:06,188
That is your aim and destination!

652
01:37:06,188 --> 01:37:07,533
"...didn't bring love, affection
and sacrifice to my house."

653
01:37:07,533 --> 01:37:09,900
That is your destination!

654
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,322
"But brought infidelity,
treachery and deceit!"

655
01:37:13,068 --> 01:37:15,435
But someday I'll prove it to you!

656
01:37:15,564 --> 01:37:19,558
Marriage is no game. It's a
promise to live and die together!

657
01:37:20,204 --> 01:37:22,179
To live and die together!

658
01:37:24,556 --> 01:37:25,570
My picture...

659
01:37:36,971 --> 01:37:39,243
"Since we're near the church,
Shall I light a candle and come?"

660
01:37:39,243 --> 01:37:39,403
Yesterday I saw a place
for myself in your heart.

661
01:37:39,403 --> 01:37:40,352
All right.

662
01:37:43,756 --> 01:37:45,282
This is for that.

663
01:37:45,419 --> 01:37:49,446
What do you want to prove
by this? Your love?

664
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:55,588
Hear this carefully!
Love is not given as charity!

665
01:37:55,723 --> 01:37:57,959
"lf it were, I'd have
given it away long ago!"

666
01:37:58,539 --> 01:37:58,891
Keep your temper to yourself.
This is a house not police station.

667
01:37:58,891 --> 01:37:59,839
Help!

668
01:38:02,571 --> 01:38:08,288
I know it's a house not a
police station. Our house.

669
01:38:08,427 --> 01:38:11,973
I haven't shown any temper.

670
01:38:12,362 --> 01:38:12,482
Help!

671
01:38:13,259 --> 01:38:15,818
Like a good husband
I stayed within limits.

672
01:38:15,818 --> 01:38:16,682
- Help!
- Stop!

673
01:38:16,682 --> 01:38:19,977
I'd like you to remain within
the confines of a good wife.

674
01:38:20,939 --> 01:38:21,866
Somebody stop this!

675
01:38:25,994 --> 01:38:27,271
Hold it!

676
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:32,454
"What will you do? Beat me?
Go ahead, hit me!"

677
01:38:39,242 --> 01:38:42,341
I was looking for you dear.

678
01:38:43,274 --> 01:38:44,932
Take this.

679
01:38:46,089 --> 01:38:50,366
"Since you came to this house,
you never wore vermilion."

680
01:38:51,209 --> 01:38:56,447
Today is Karva Chauth.
Don't keep your hair unadorned.

681
01:38:56,521 --> 01:38:58,791
It reduces the life
span of the husband.

682
01:39:01,193 --> 01:39:02,141
Take it.

683
01:39:05,449 --> 01:39:09,897
Are you mad? Your carelessness
could have cost many lives!

684
01:39:09,897 --> 01:39:10,440
What are you saying?

685
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,935
Couldn't you have come
forward and used the brake?

686
01:39:12,008 --> 01:39:12,488
- He hit you?
- Yes.

687
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:13,666
Stop crying.

688
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:15,977
"It's not her fault, sir.
She doesn't know how to drive."

689
01:39:15,977 --> 01:39:18,627
And not once.
It happened many times.

690
01:39:18,761 --> 01:39:23,071
- Why didn't you tell me?
- How could l?

691
01:39:23,272 --> 01:39:25,182
You are responsible for this.

692
01:39:25,256 --> 01:39:26,345
It's all right. Just check the
license and car papers.

693
01:39:26,345 --> 01:39:31,272
"lf you hadn't married me there on
a whim, I wouldn't be in this state."

694
01:39:31,272 --> 01:39:32,614
I'll drop you.

695
01:39:34,088 --> 01:39:35,400
I fear that some day
these people will...

696
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:39,261
Thank you very much.
Please come in.

697
01:39:39,431 --> 01:39:39,591
I won't let you go
without a cup of tea.

698
01:39:39,591 --> 01:39:43,585
I had thought Arjun would
fill your life with happiness.

699
01:39:43,721 --> 01:39:45,160
I made a mistake.

700
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,952
I'm getting late. I'll
come some other time.

701
01:39:46,952 --> 01:39:48,615
He only saw the face of a father
now he'll see the Colonel!

702
01:39:48,615 --> 01:39:50,525
- Just a cup of tea.
- Some other time.

703
01:39:51,591 --> 01:39:55,333
Then come in for some Holy Food.
You can't turn that down.

704
01:39:55,463 --> 01:39:57,667
- All right. I have to hurry.
- In a jiffy.

705
01:40:02,055 --> 01:40:04,226
Please come in. Be seated.

706
01:40:05,735 --> 01:40:06,950
- What does he think of himself?
- You've come to plead her case?

707
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:10,179
- You?
- You here with my wife?

708
01:40:12,424 --> 01:40:14,725
- I don't think you know
your daughter... - Mother!

709
01:40:16,647 --> 01:40:17,670
- No mother.
- May I ask why you hit my child?

710
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:20,354
I never asked you this question.

711
01:40:20,518 --> 01:40:21,191
When I met you at the check
post with my wife.

712
01:40:21,191 --> 01:40:22,139
Answer me.

713
01:40:24,262 --> 01:40:26,946
So you want to take revenge?

714
01:40:28,135 --> 01:40:30,087
Is this why you married her?

715
01:40:30,087 --> 01:40:30,726
If you think this meeting is
a revenge...

716
01:40:30,726 --> 01:40:33,319
You promised that you would
never let her be harmed.

717
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:34,566
- then I have taken mine.
- What?

718
01:40:34,566 --> 01:40:38,657
I never expected you to do this.

719
01:40:38,885 --> 01:40:39,461
Have some.

720
01:40:39,461 --> 01:40:40,390
I made a mistake that
I thought you were decent.

721
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:42,214
- Do you know each other?
- Yes.

722
01:40:42,214 --> 01:40:46,305
You are a stone!
Who has no heart!

723
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:46,789
Here... have it.

724
01:40:46,789 --> 01:40:49,990
I won't let my child be here for
a moment to break her on this stone!

725
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:51,558
May God bless you with wisdom!

726
01:40:51,558 --> 01:40:54,013
I will get her a divorce!

727
01:40:55,526 --> 01:40:58,014
"
Son, why were you quiet?"

728
01:40:58,182 --> 01:41:02,470
How will Colonel know that Pinky
never accepted you as a husband?

729
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:04,421
- What wrong with you?
- I don't like you meeting strangers!

730
01:41:04,421 --> 01:41:08,250
She threw vermilion on Karva
Chauth and insulted womanhood!

731
01:41:09,573 --> 01:41:12,573
"lf you couldn't say this,
why didn't you let me?"

732
01:41:14,789 --> 01:41:18,085
Because Colonel would be
hurt if he knew the truth.

733
01:41:18,085 --> 01:41:19,994
- Today I'm very happy!
- Why?

734
01:41:20,069 --> 01:41:21,413
Inspector Arjun saved me

735
01:41:21,413 --> 01:41:22,661
And I didn't want that.

736
01:41:22,661 --> 01:41:25,246
- Were you hurt?
- No.

737
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:25,957
Bunty's felt hurt
when he saw Arjun with him.

738
01:41:25,957 --> 01:41:29,796
I can't bear a good man like him
feel heart broken and shattered.

739
01:41:29,796 --> 01:41:32,863
For the first time I saw anger
and jealousy in his eyes.

740
01:41:34,659 --> 01:41:37,659
Jealousy is only seen
where there's love.

741
01:41:38,372 --> 01:41:38,692
It means our Khandala formula
was successful.

742
01:41:38,692 --> 01:41:41,823
I've heard everything.

743
01:41:43,492 --> 01:41:47,322
- I'm embarassed.
- Don't embarrass me.

744
01:41:47,844 --> 01:41:50,975
I called you a stone.

745
01:41:53,156 --> 01:41:56,985
But I forgot that
stones are worshipped.

746
01:42:06,532 --> 01:42:07,775
What did they say?

747
01:42:10,116 --> 01:42:11,609
Why are you looking
at me like this?

748
01:42:13,443 --> 01:42:16,061
I know they filled
your ears against me!

749
01:42:16,195 --> 01:42:19,511
"Don't believe them.
They are liars, cheats!"

750
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:33,400
You slapped me?

751
01:42:34,178 --> 01:42:37,692
Yes. For the first time in my life.

752
01:42:39,138 --> 01:42:45,248
But I'm sorry that I got
taken in by my daughter.

753
01:42:45,378 --> 01:42:48,826
Because of you I doubted
that angel of a man!

754
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:51,383
Insulted that godly mother!

755
01:42:52,578 --> 01:42:58,743
It's my fault. My love spoilt
and made you arrogant and stubborn!

756
01:43:01,762 --> 01:43:04,828
But I won't repeat the mistake!

757
01:43:06,050 --> 01:43:07,129
Come with me.

758
01:43:09,186 --> 01:43:13,146
I am as much at fault as her.

759
01:43:13,953 --> 01:43:18,525
I forgot to teach her what respect
for elders and tradition is.

760
01:43:20,193 --> 01:43:23,903
everything to you. Understand?

761
01:43:38,113 --> 01:43:40,055
- See what's wrong...
- What happened?

762
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:44,182
I don't know. I'm feeling giddy.

763
01:43:45,185 --> 01:43:48,414
- I'm feeling low.
- And want to eat sour things?

764
01:43:48,545 --> 01:43:51,512
"- Tamarind, pickle?
- Yes."

765
01:43:52,257 --> 01:43:55,453
I bought this pickle
only for this day!

766
01:43:55,585 --> 01:43:58,748
Know which pickle this is?
The Khandala one!

767
01:44:00,736 --> 01:44:03,638
- I'm going to become a grandmother?
- Yes!

768
01:44:06,208 --> 01:44:09,076
- What's going on?
- Don't ask me.

769
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:11,004
It's all your doing!

770
01:44:11,296 --> 01:44:14,525
"- Get some sweets!
- Here they are, sister."

771
01:44:16,512 --> 01:44:17,919
Open your mouth.

772
01:44:18,207 --> 01:44:22,331
- I'll be a grandfather!
- And me a grandmother!

773
01:44:22,815 --> 01:44:25,663
Shobha is going to be a
mother and you the father!

774
01:44:26,656 --> 01:44:29,884
Father! Oh my Dad!

775
01:44:33,407 --> 01:44:37,149
- Aunt...
- Ass! Nothing can be done!

776
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:40,856
- What have you done?
- What can I say...

777
01:44:40,991 --> 01:44:46,773
What can you say? This is fate.

778
01:44:46,911 --> 01:44:50,707
- But it's because of you!
- You do the deed and blame me!

779
01:44:51,647 --> 01:44:57,560
I sent you to Khandala thinking
you and Pinky would knock down...

780
01:44:57,694 --> 01:45:02,647
the wall called Shobha. But you
made the wall into a mountain!

781
01:45:04,286 --> 01:45:09,436
Just think if Pinky
finds out you and Shobha...!

782
01:45:11,327 --> 01:45:12,755
How will I face her?

783
01:45:13,630 --> 01:45:17,426
What will happen of you?
I can't think!

784
01:45:39,197 --> 01:45:44,282
I had to use these flowers to
remove the thorns between us.

785
01:45:52,636 --> 01:45:58,714
I don't deserve it but
forgive me if you can.

786
01:46:07,804 --> 01:46:10,171
This means you...

787
01:46:10,876 --> 01:46:13,429
It seems you have never peered
into a woman's heart.

788
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:20,472
"When she hates someone, her
hatred assumes sky high proportions."

789
01:46:22,396 --> 01:46:28,473
"And when she loves, her love
is deeper than the ocean."

790
01:46:33,595 --> 01:46:36,911
I've invited all your friends
over for your birthday.

791
01:46:37,052 --> 01:46:39,800
I'm throwing a grand party for you.

792
01:46:39,931 --> 01:46:44,404
Papa won't come because he has
an important defense meeting.

793
01:46:45,371 --> 01:46:47,062
But he's sent you a gift.

794
01:46:51,067 --> 01:46:54,962
Dress up fast or we'll be
late for our own party.

795
01:51:04,563 --> 01:51:07,181
- Let's go home.
- We will.

796
01:51:07,955 --> 01:51:11,271
What's the hurry?
The night is young.

797
01:51:19,859 --> 01:51:22,859
"- Mother, have a drink for me.
- Aren't you ashamed?"

798
01:51:24,787 --> 01:51:28,048
What the...? You ruined my sandal?

799
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:31,854
Now you will clean it.

800
01:51:33,395 --> 01:51:35,304
"
Come on, clean it."

801
01:51:38,674 --> 01:51:44,620
Shameless! Asking the mother at whose
feet heaven lies to wipe your shoe!

802
01:51:49,873 --> 01:51:52,426
How much should I control myself?

803
01:51:53,522 --> 01:51:53,772
There's a limit to patience!

804
01:51:55,826 --> 01:51:57,997
She reciprocated
my love with hatred!

805
01:51:58,129 --> 01:51:59,853
I tolerated it.

806
01:51:59,985 --> 01:52:02,984
She forgot her limits!
I still tolerated it.

807
01:52:03,121 --> 01:52:07,856
Today she was disrespectful to
my mother which I won't tolerate!

808
01:52:07,985 --> 01:52:09,873
I won't tolerate it!

809
01:52:11,345 --> 01:52:13,516
Why don't you leave me then?

810
01:52:27,153 --> 01:52:30,633
I'll send the divorce papers
tomorrow. Sign them.

811
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:05,161
You would have better girls
if you had joined hands with us.

812
01:53:05,297 --> 01:53:08,612
Wealth would be at your feet.

813
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:10,862
Son of a dog!

814
01:53:18,864 --> 01:53:19,976
Take him away!

815
01:53:29,872 --> 01:53:31,300
- Son..
- Sorry sir.

816
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:34,090
- But...
- I don't want to listen to anything!

817
01:53:34,223 --> 01:53:37,485
I can bear anything but
my mother being insulted!

818
01:53:38,287 --> 01:53:40,939
I respect you so l
request you to leave.

819
01:53:47,888 --> 01:53:50,986
I've come to write a complaint.

820
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:53,607
It's your duty to write it down.

821
01:53:54,318 --> 01:53:59,850
I agree my daughter
is arrogant and impetuous.

822
01:53:59,982 --> 01:54:03,877
But I can't help it.
I'm a father.

823
01:54:04,014 --> 01:54:07,908
Being her father l
have a right to know...

824
01:54:08,047 --> 01:54:10,949
Where my daughter is
and in what condition.

825
01:54:12,622 --> 01:54:13,833
Hasn't she come home?

826
01:54:13,966 --> 01:54:16,617
It's when I called your
house that I learnt..

827
01:54:22,798 --> 01:54:24,707
Jagawar here.

828
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:31,754
My son is in your custody.

829
01:54:32,717 --> 01:54:36,874
Your wife is in my captivity.

830
01:54:39,533 --> 01:54:44,967
Bring my son and take your wife.

831
01:54:46,317 --> 01:54:49,699
But don't try to act smart.

832
01:54:49,837 --> 01:54:54,114
- Bring my son alone.
- All right.

833
01:55:04,973 --> 01:55:08,039
He won't come!
He'll never come for me!

834
01:55:08,205 --> 01:55:12,994
For him the bond of a marriage
is stronger than that of breath.

835
01:55:15,532 --> 01:55:20,039
But the same man is divorcing me.
You are wasting your time!

836
01:55:24,012 --> 01:55:25,638
He won't come! Never!

837
01:55:37,932 --> 01:55:40,168
"l know it's your tricks, Arjun."

838
01:55:41,579 --> 01:55:46,500
Come out from wherever you are!
Or I'll shoot your wife!

839
01:56:01,099 --> 01:56:03,968
Have you come alone?
Where's my son?

840
01:56:06,667 --> 01:56:08,576
In the police lock up.

841
01:56:12,714 --> 01:56:16,456
I had told you you'll get
your wife when I get my son.

842
01:56:16,587 --> 01:56:20,264
You told a police officer that.

843
01:56:20,394 --> 01:56:24,071
But a husband has come
here to rescue his wife.

844
01:56:27,402 --> 01:56:28,350
Thrash him.

845
01:56:29,130 --> 01:56:34,083
Thrash him till he agrees
to bring my son.

846
01:56:47,882 --> 01:56:49,953
`Today is Karva Chauth'.

847
01:56:50,089 --> 01:56:53,951
`Don't let your hair be unadorned.
It reduces the life of the husband'.

848
01:57:13,065 --> 01:57:16,677
Don't beat him! Please!

849
01:57:18,856 --> 01:57:21,758
Please don't beat my Arjun!

850
01:57:23,464 --> 01:57:25,604
Please don't beat my Arjun!

851
01:57:47,464 --> 01:57:49,122
Let my father free!

852
01:57:50,535 --> 01:57:53,089
Let him go or I'll kill you!

853
01:57:55,975 --> 01:57:57,830
Well done my son!

854
01:57:58,599 --> 01:58:01,087
For the first time I can
be sure you're my son!

855
01:58:02,472 --> 01:58:07,293
"Now you won't doubt my mother.
Papu, I won't spare him!"

856
01:58:08,775 --> 01:58:10,051
I'll kill him!

857
01:58:11,015 --> 01:58:14,146
"- He locked my brother in prison!
- Aim on him, sonny!"

858
01:58:14,278 --> 01:58:16,417
And destroyed our businesses!

859
01:58:16,551 --> 01:58:18,044
"- Don't fire, sonny!
- I'll kill him!"

860
01:58:19,174 --> 01:58:21,214
Hiccup! Son-of-a-gun!

861
01:58:26,054 --> 01:58:28,869
Swine! Your hiccup
ruined everything!

862
01:58:39,238 --> 01:58:40,186
Stop!

863
01:58:41,349 --> 01:58:44,164
"l say, stop! Or I fire!"

864
01:58:48,006 --> 01:58:49,948
Forgive me!

865
01:58:57,446 --> 01:58:58,395
You...?

866
01:59:01,445 --> 01:59:05,984
Every policeman is
not as honest as you.

867
01:59:12,198 --> 01:59:13,986
"Bravo, son!"

868
01:59:16,581 --> 01:59:17,628
No!

869
01:59:18,853 --> 01:59:21,603
You hit me a lot in remand.

870
01:59:21,733 --> 01:59:24,221
Well done!

871
01:59:25,445 --> 01:59:28,445
Now he is down on his knees!

872
01:59:35,812 --> 01:59:38,430
"You love your wife a lot, don't you?"

873
01:59:54,596 --> 01:59:59,037
Extinguish this burning string
before it reaches the bomb.

874
02:00:00,067 --> 02:00:02,937
Save your wife if you can.

875
02:00:09,283 --> 02:00:14,782
Don't risk your life for a
stubborn and arrogant wife like me!

876
02:00:14,915 --> 02:00:17,598
Let me die!

877
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:33,665
Let's escape before
the bomb explodes.

878
02:00:53,250 --> 02:00:55,738
"- What do I do with this?
- Throw it out, you fool!"

879
02:01:38,752 --> 02:01:39,701
No!

880
02:01:59,872 --> 02:02:03,320
"l am going to the village,
but I'm very frightened."

881
02:02:03,455 --> 02:02:05,430
I hope our efforts
don't go waste.

882
02:02:05,568 --> 02:02:10,805
Fool! Bunty's love for
Pinky was just infatuation.

883
02:02:10,944 --> 02:02:14,653
Which has lost its' fizz
like weak soda water.

884
02:02:14,783 --> 02:02:20,151
He'll never think of leaving you.
This was our aim and we've won.

885
02:02:20,543 --> 02:02:22,933
He has lost to himself.

886
02:02:24,032 --> 02:02:27,643
"It's late, I must leave. Do call up."

887
02:02:27,775 --> 02:02:29,302
- Bye aunt.
- Take care and call up.

888
02:02:32,031 --> 02:02:36,025
"So this was your trick, aunt.
But I haven't accepted defeat."

889
02:02:36,990 --> 02:02:39,194
Watch what I'll do.

890
02:02:51,390 --> 02:02:52,600
I'm going home.

891
02:02:56,190 --> 02:02:59,354
I know you don't like it.

892
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:05,587
Even I don't want to go because
I feel at peace with you.

893
02:03:05,693 --> 02:03:07,384
And I've lost my peace
because of you!

894
02:03:08,669 --> 02:03:12,498
You have cheated me!
And the answer to that is deceit!

895
02:03:13,533 --> 02:03:19,381
You are right. If it is deceit
to become mod for the husband...

896
02:03:19,518 --> 02:03:21,144
I have been deceitful.

897
02:03:23,005 --> 02:03:27,196
"lf it's deceit to want your
husband, I have done it."

898
02:03:27,325 --> 02:03:33,076
But was our union that day a deceit?

899
02:03:34,429 --> 02:03:36,218
That was just an accident.

900
02:03:36,349 --> 02:03:39,032
I have forgotten it.
You too must forget it.

901
02:03:39,165 --> 02:03:41,238
I can't stay with you for a moment.

902
02:03:45,277 --> 02:03:50,906
"lf it makes you happy, I'll take
the symbol of this accident..."

903
02:03:51,037 --> 02:03:53,011
And walk out of your life forever.

904
02:03:59,452 --> 02:04:03,313
- I'm sorry for what happened.
- But I'm not.

905
02:04:04,732 --> 02:04:10,362
When like Ganga I have found place
in Lord Shiva's lock of hair...

906
02:04:10,492 --> 02:04:12,914
Then why should I feel sorry
for falling to the earth?

907
02:04:14,844 --> 02:04:18,324
If my love is true...

908
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:20,314
Someday you will be sorry.

909
02:04:41,755 --> 02:04:42,802
Mother...

910
02:04:44,058 --> 02:04:45,881
With the sacred fire as witness...

911
02:04:46,011 --> 02:04:47,734
I did walk around it with Arjun.

912
02:04:49,979 --> 02:04:54,256
But today I learnt
what husband means.

913
02:04:54,394 --> 02:04:56,053
What a husband and wife relation is.

914
02:04:58,426 --> 02:05:00,848
I have faith Arjun is alive.

915
02:05:02,106 --> 02:05:03,153
Full faith!

916
02:05:05,914 --> 02:05:07,572
Unite me with him.

917
02:05:09,690 --> 02:05:11,599
Unite me with my Arjun.

918
02:05:31,802 --> 02:05:36,439
After the jeep fell from
such a height..

919
02:05:36,569 --> 02:05:38,227
he is still untraceable.

920
02:05:39,897 --> 02:05:43,028
- Then his dead body...
- You are lying!

921
02:05:43,161 --> 02:05:45,911
You always tell the truth!
Then why are you lying today?

922
02:05:46,617 --> 02:05:48,471
You are lying papa!

923
02:05:51,961 --> 02:05:56,468
Calm down dear.
I have controlled myself.

924
02:05:57,721 --> 02:05:59,347
You too must control yourself.

925
02:06:05,112 --> 02:06:06,061
Calm down.

926
02:06:07,865 --> 02:06:10,101
May be this is what God wanted.

927
02:06:32,568 --> 02:06:34,160
Till today I kept turning him away.

928
02:06:36,152 --> 02:06:38,061
But today he turned me down.

929
02:06:40,887 --> 02:06:42,610
He left me.

930
02:07:48,470 --> 02:07:50,892
Finally times are with us.

931
02:07:51,797 --> 02:07:55,277
Pinky is a widow and
Shobha left me forever.

932
02:07:56,245 --> 02:08:00,435
Now Pinky will be mine.
This is a victory for our love.

933
02:08:01,557 --> 02:08:02,506
Yes son.

934
02:08:03,605 --> 02:08:05,939
But I have one regret.

935
02:08:07,285 --> 02:08:12,467
I regret that
Shobha and Arjun's sacrifice...

936
02:08:12,597 --> 02:08:16,241
would come to such an end...
I never imagined it.

937
02:08:33,972 --> 02:08:36,557
I felt sorry to hear about Arjun.

938
02:08:36,692 --> 02:08:39,539
But who can fight fate?

939
02:08:41,331 --> 02:08:44,146
You maybe Arjun's widow for the world.

940
02:08:44,275 --> 02:08:49,326
For me you are still the same girl
I wanted under any circumstance.

941
02:08:52,147 --> 02:08:55,889
I've made Shobha sign
the divorce papers.

942
02:08:58,995 --> 02:09:00,904
And she signed them?

943
02:09:01,650 --> 02:09:02,599
Yes.

944
02:09:03,731 --> 02:09:07,407
A sacrifice so great
just for the sake of your happiness.

945
02:09:07,539 --> 02:09:11,281
Just like Arjun did for me.

946
02:09:12,371 --> 02:09:16,364
Because love sacrifices
doesn't ask for sacrifice.

947
02:09:17,874 --> 02:09:21,649
Our love was based on
selfishness and stubbornness.

948
02:09:22,610 --> 02:09:26,440
Our love was not love.

949
02:09:26,578 --> 02:09:29,328
It was just an infatuation.

950
02:09:30,290 --> 02:09:35,079
Like a little child is
attracted to light.

951
02:09:35,218 --> 02:09:37,007
And he burns his hands.

952
02:09:38,738 --> 02:09:42,797
Think about this.
If we really loved each other..

953
02:09:42,929 --> 02:09:45,832
We wouldn't have been scared
of the crowd at the bus stop.

954
02:09:45,970 --> 02:09:47,758
Money would never be a hurdle.

955
02:09:48,818 --> 02:09:50,923
Living in a hut would seem
like a castle.

956
02:09:52,658 --> 02:09:57,295
It's a different matter
that I understand this today.

957
02:09:57,426 --> 02:09:58,832
After losing Arjun.

958
02:10:01,681 --> 02:10:03,885
But we have only one heart.

959
02:10:05,169 --> 02:10:10,090
And deceit and conscience
can't live in it together.

960
02:10:14,448 --> 02:10:15,725
You are right.

961
02:10:17,522 --> 02:10:19,245
Homes are not made of sand.

962
02:10:21,041 --> 02:10:25,002
"That you make,
break and walk away."

963
02:10:28,144 --> 02:10:30,894
Look at this.

964
02:10:34,897 --> 02:10:36,522
We couldn't unite.

965
02:10:37,617 --> 02:10:41,446
But unknowingly our decisions
turned out to be the same.

966
02:10:41,584 --> 02:10:44,201
The wedding ceremony is
for life not to be broken.

967
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,960
Even if the name be Arjun Shroff.
