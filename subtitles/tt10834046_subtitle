TV: Chaudhvin Ka Chand Ho song is
played from the film Chaudhvin Ka Chand.

00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:36,994
Das!

4
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:39,384
I only come once in a month.

5
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,662
And exactly he won't be
around when I am here.

6
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:42,763
Hey!

7
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:00,660
Hey...

00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:55,808
-What do you want?
-Hello.

12
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:58,587
I need to meet Dr. Anitha Kumari,
the cardiologist.

13
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,543
Do you have any appointment?

14
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:01,381
I spoke to you over the phone about this.

15
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:02,593
Oh! Is that you?

16
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,086
-Yes.
-I have already told you over the phone,

17
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:06,506
that it's not possible to meet the
doctor without a prior appointment.

18
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:07,931
The matter is very serious.

19
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:11,184
Please understand that we cannot allow
anyone to meet without any appointment.

20
00:03:11,384 --> 00:03:14,261
Hmm! If diseases come
with an prior appointment,

21
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,856
you would have to
close all these hospitals.

22
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,385
Dhana, please go and wait in the lobby.

23
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:18,650
If you think you can
take care of everything,

24
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,518
then why do you bring me here?

25
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:22,558
You may also leave madam,
I need the prepare this bill, please.

26
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:24,496
-Please understand what I'm trying to say.
-Hey, what is the problem here?

27
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:26,724
She wants to meet Dr. Anitha and
she doesn't even have any appointment.

28
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,101
Doctor... it's an emergency.

29
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,597
Okay, I am going to the doctors chambers,

30
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:31,733
I'll find out and let you know if
you can meet her. You may please sit.

31
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,362
-Thank you.
-Okay.

Madam...

00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:38,366
Huh?
[door closes]

34
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:40,226
Shift the patient to the ICU...

35
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:40,826
Okay.

36
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:41,561
and once the sedation wears out,

37
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:42,916
-inform me once.
-Okay madam.

38
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,496
And I need to go out now,

39
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:46,269
so kindly cancel all the
appointments for today.

40
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:47,480
You don't have any appointments,

41
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,606
but a lady wants to meet to you and
is waiting outside the chamber, madam.

42
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,441
When I have already asked you
to cancel all the appointments,

43
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:52,668
why do you still ask me? Please leave.

44
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:54,661
-Doctor.
-Yes?

45
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:57,591
-Where is my injection?
-Madam, it's there on your table.

46
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,034
-Okay you can go.
-Okay madam.

47
00:04:06,243 --> 00:04:06,668
Doctor?

48
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:10,286
Sorry, you cannot meet her today.
Please come tomorrow.

49
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:11,699
Huh!

50
00:04:12,663 --> 00:04:14,327
Madam, madam please wait.

51
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,185
Madam... what happened?

52
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,960
Madam get up!

[music mutes voices]

54
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,773
Do you know any details about that lady?

55
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:06,847
I have no clue about her, but I did
see a guy whose has accompanied her.

56
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:08,008
He's got to be around here.

57
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:10,375
-Shruti go and check.
-Hmm...

[bashing]
[groans]

59
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,040
Tell me...

60
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,499
[bashing]
Sir, no.

61
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:16,296
I'll not spare you.

62
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:17,753
Please send me home as soon as
possible, am really getting scared here.

63
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:19,924
-Hey... show him our style.
-Okay madam.

64
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:20,996
-Sir.
-Sir.

65
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:23,389
ACP sir, they are beating me up.

66
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:25,922
Hey don't you know who I am?
I am an MLA's son.

67
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:26,816
-You are not fit for...
-Hey!

68
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:28,166
so who cares if you are an MLA's son?

69
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,952
What so great about your father?
Lock him behind the bars.

70
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:30,494
Okay sir.

71
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:38,675
-Did you get the CCTV footage, Srikanth?
-Yes, sir.

72
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:45,822
Laptop: No audio file is played.

73
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:58,159
A lady has come to meet you.
She wants to meet you urgently it seems.

74
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:00,029
-Ask her to wait for 5 minutes.
-Okay sir.

75
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:26,604
-Get the interrogation room ready...
-Sir..

76
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,064
and also get the post mortem report.

77
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:28,836
-Okay?
-Okay sir.

78
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,406
I hope you don't mind.

79
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,140
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

80
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:50,922
[lighter clicks]

81
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,068
You who have
disappeared from the hospital?

82
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:56,465
May I know why did you
show up here all of a sudden?

83
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:58,205
I had to come.

84
00:06:58,514 --> 00:06:59,950
Why did you have to rush to
meet the most popular doctor...

85
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,078
in the city without any prior appointment?

86
00:07:02,544 --> 00:07:04,296
Though the hospital staff denied why
did you have to push through them...

87
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:06,666
and what reason did you
have to enter her cabin?

88
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:11,325
Exactly when you went to meet her,

89
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:12,525
she died at the
time you entered her cabin!

90
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:14,660
-Miss?
-Anu.

91
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:17,785
So can I assume that you have
any relation with the murder?

92
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:20,035
Hmm... yes.

93
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:23,660
Can you elaborate it?

94
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:28,369
If you want to understand, you first
need to know who I am and what I do.

95
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:32,494
Silence... silence... silence!

96
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:34,497
[indistinctive crowd chatter]

97
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:43,086
Why do you want to fight your own case?

98
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,909
Money sir, money.

99
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:48,735
If I had money why would I want to die?

100
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,360
Don't you know it's
illegal to commit suicide?

101
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,364
Yes, I know sir.

102
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,177
For people who are filthy
rich might have many stories.

103
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:58,194
But middleclass people like
me all have the same story.

104
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,444
Life is full of obstacles.

105
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:05,197
Though we walk on the land we
have our gaze high up on the sky.

106
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,110
We don't prefer to buy the 1 rupee
per kilo rice at the ration shop,

107
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:11,444
and we can't afford to buy for
rupees 50 kilo rice at the supermarket.

108
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,569
Most of the salary goes in
paying the bills and EMI's.

109
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:18,985
Every month we keep borrowing and
keep getting into trouble because of that.

110
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:21,235
What else do you think I can do
than trying to commit suicide, sir?

111
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,360
After reviewing the entire case...

112
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:26,194
irrespective of how
difficult it is to survive,

113
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:29,777
a person does not have the
right to take his own life.

114
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:36,138
The accused is punished with a year of
ordinary jail term under IPC section 309.

115
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:39,095
Also,
orders are passed to the police that...

116
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:42,571
...she is given counselling by
physiologists during her jail term.

117
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,423
-Ah!
-Sorry... sorry sir.

118
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:45,073
Cut it!

119
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,793
-Anu!
-Sir?

120
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:51,944
Sir...

121
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,970
-Who is that fellow?
-Umm...

122
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:57,402
He looks like a stick and doesn't even
seem to know how to hold the baton.

123
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:00,516
Make the hero say all the
dialogues you have just said.

124
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:01,409
Sure sir.

125
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,604
Replay once...

126
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:05,402
Hey... What did Maruti sir say?

127
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:07,797
Hmm...
He asked me to take you off your role.

128
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:09,610
Oh, so my plan has worked out!

129
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:11,255
-What plan?
-Then what!

130
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:13,360
You told me that... I will have to
play one scene with three dialogues.

131
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:16,719
But here its only one dialogue
which I have to say three times.

132
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,074
Rama Rao... Rama Rao... Rama rao!

133
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:21,777
Hey, you need to take up these
small roles to grow in your film career.

134
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:24,239
It isn't that way,
once you play a certain kind of role,

135
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,482
you will be chosen for the
same kind of roles forever.

136
00:09:25,682 --> 00:09:27,735
You don't believe me? Wait,
let me prove that to you. Come with me.

137
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:28,857
What man?

138
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:30,463
Uncle can you please come here once.

139
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,524
What's you name Uncle?
-Koteshwara Rao.

140
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:35,247
Nice name.

141
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:36,885
For how long have you been doing
the same 'police constable' role?

142
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:38,070
For the past 30 years

143
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:40,146
Even a real police constable in
his job would have retired by now,

144
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:40,899
you may leave.

145
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:43,459
Sharat sir, if you don't
mind, please come here once.

146
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,298
What's it man?

147
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:47,580
In how many languages
have you acted till day?

148
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:51,879
Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi,
Bhojpuri and recently in English too.

149
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:52,951
So in all languages, you have
played the role of a judge, right?

150
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,789
Yes, of course.

151
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:55,674
What is your famous dialogue sir?

152
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:57,235
Order... order... order.

153
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:59,733
-Court is adjourned sir. You may leave.
-Oh you silly!

154
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:00,895
Okay now tell me,

155
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:03,540
if I keep playing these small roles,
can I ever dream of becoming a hero?

156
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:04,878
Go to hell,

157
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:06,154
-I have to explain this scene to the hero.
-Okay, go.

158
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:08,912
Excuse me,
she doesn't know how to value a friend

159
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:10,114
and all she wants is
be an popular director it seems.

160
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:11,785
-Sir, please remove this costume.
-What?

161
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:12,363
Why?

162
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:14,125
Director has asked me to
play your character now.

163
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:15,080
-He asked you to play this role?
-Yes.

164
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,181
Go, go and...

165
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:19,183
Take this and keep saying
Ramarao... Ramarao... Ramarao.

166
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:20,567
Nobody will come up in your life...
Damn it!

167
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,944
Why did you put the alarm?
When we have no shooting today.

168
00:10:32,194 --> 00:10:33,577
Why don't you let me sleep peacefully?

169
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,711
Please make some coffee for me,
I need to go and meet Babu.

170
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:37,633
What! You need to meet Babu?

171
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,610
Hmm... make some coffee man!

172
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:41,849
You are so lucky!

173
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:44,194
You are making the future
hero make coffee for you. Great!

174
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:47,152
-For me too...
-What?

175
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:48,848
Coffee... with Anu.

176
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,652
Anu, aunty is asking for the house rent.

177
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:53,707
Uncle I am going to meet
Babu to narrate my story.

178
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:54,955
Once back, I shall pay you the rent.

179
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:59,037
Once back home doesn't means...
she will pay once she returns home.

180
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:00,610
It means that if they pay
advance and then we will pay the rent.

181
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:03,069
Oh my god! What is my situation now?

182
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:06,028
The one who owns a
house has to give it for rent

183
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:08,496
and the one who rents
it never pays the rent.

184
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,880
That's the way it is... one should not
feel sad for what cannot be averted.

185
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,265
[birds chirping]
Don't know man,

186
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,295
I just don't understand anything.

187
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,485
If you need to understand the Geeta,
you need have some liquor at night.

188
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:20,199
Don't know how much money he have?

189
00:11:20,402 --> 00:11:21,648
My bad fate, my fate.

190
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,485
It's hard to maintain you than my wife.

191
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,485
-Darling...
-Yes, coming,

192
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:28,027
And she doesn't want to
understand that I am tired...

193
00:11:28,444 --> 00:11:30,296
Hey go, go, I know your wife is
calling to wash the clothes...

194
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:31,408
-Yeah come along and wash the clothes.
-Oh no!

195
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:33,902
I need to go to meet Babu,
which means I need to get ready.

196
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:42,402
Hey Dhana, be careful with
you behaviour in front of Babu.

197
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:44,777
But just one selfie, please!

198
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,569
Okay. But don't put your arm
around him or anything like that.

199
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:51,911
Once I take a picture with Babu and post
it on Instagram, Facebook and twitter,

200
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:52,927
then I can have so many followers.

201
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:58,735
Mr. Babu has asked me to come.

202
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:00,860
Oh is that you,
who has come to narrate a story?

203
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:01,904
-Yes.
-Please wait.

204
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:02,863
[caravan door opens]

205
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,860
When you were saying Babu, Babu,
I thought it would be Mahesh Babu...

206
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,527
but it is Sampoornesh Babu?

207
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:30,527
-Hi...
-Hi sir.

208
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:32,874
Who is that guy,
wearing a shirt over a T-shirt?

209
00:12:33,196 --> 00:12:35,833
-Is he your assistant?
-No sir, he is my friend.

210
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,524
He was pleading me for a selfie with you,
so he came along.

211
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,793
Oh, so he is my fan! Come.

212
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:43,576
Sir, I forgot my phone in the vehicle,
I'll go get it.

213
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:45,777
My fan? And he doesn't have a phone?

214
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:48,319
-Let's go we'll sit and talk.
-Sure sir.

215
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:50,569
-Please start.
-Sure Sir.

216
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:55,030
[birds chirping]
Opening scene...

217
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,272
[music]

218
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,610
That is the story, Babu.

219
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:04,944
The story is nice...
But where are 'those'?

220
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:07,326
-What are those means?
-Lip locks!

221
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:11,277
Hey... don't you know I am called
the Emraan Hashmi of the telugu industry.

222
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,062
How can we keep lip
locks in this story, sir?

223
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:14,330
Why? Why not?

224
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,066
The heroine's father dies, right?

225
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,097
The hero can have a lip
lock while pacifying her.

226
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:25,450
In the same way when I try to commit
suicide on Tankbund as the I lose my job,

227
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,892
there a lip lock with the
lady constable who saves me.

228
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:32,107
When I am frustrated
and don't know what to do,

229
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:36,880
because my parents have scolded me, there
comes another lip lock with the heroine.

230
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:42,486
There is lot of space and scope
for lip locks. Follow the trend!

231
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:47,447
True sir, while the police is
beating you up in the police station,

232
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,747
another lip lock scene.
[laughs]

233
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:51,383
It is good...
But who is going to kiss me then?

234
00:13:51,694 --> 00:13:53,827
Yes, that is what I will
think over and come tomorrow.

235
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,555
Good, you are on the right track.
All the best.

236
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,287
You sure will come tomorrow, right?

237
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,081
Bloody... He wants lip locks, it seems.

238
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:01,286
Let's go!

239
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:05,121
The one with liquor is for me, the one
that doesn't have liquor is for her!

240
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,312
The one that doesn't
have liquor is for her,

241
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,063
-the one that has liquor is for me!
-What? You look so happy?

242
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:09,973
The story has not been accepted, uncle.

243
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:11,980
-Don't worry it will happen.
-My foot, it won't!

244
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,241
Let's have a drink, come.

245
00:14:14,584 --> 00:14:15,598
What? Just Thums up!

246
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:18,220
Uncle the one that has liquor is for us,

247
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:19,765
the one that doesn't
have liquor is for Anu.

248
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:22,831
I'll go get an omlette... don't be a
miser and drink it all by yourself.

249
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:23,537
Okay.

250
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,162
[Singing Mandu Babulam song
from the film Gabbar Singh.]

251
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:28,115
Oh no! He has mixed it very strong.

252
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:31,459
I know they won't give chance
for new directors easily sir,

253
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:35,220
but I want to direct my own story.

254
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,235
Anyway,
thank you for listening to my story.

255
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:41,670
[sighs]

256
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,931
Don't worry my dear, as long as you
try, even obstacles turn opportunities.

257
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:50,901
Just wait and watch, you will become
a great director one day! I trust you.

258
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,335
Every year,
I have been thinking so, uncle.

259
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:56,710
They say the story is nice,
but the producers don't have the money...

260
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:59,779
They says hero is busy and
there are no call sheets.

261
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:01,822
They say they will do
the next movie with me.

262
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,557
I am tired of listening
to these excuses, uncle.

263
00:15:04,513 --> 00:15:05,698
I so feel like killing... somebody.

264
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,755
On my god...
[groans]

265
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:13,911
[gasps]
Oh my god! She had the liquor.

266
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:16,623
-Where are you?
-Here.

267
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,508
Hey, why did you climb up there?

268
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,090
If I am not up here,
she is sure to send me up there!

269
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:24,025
Stories! What story you want?

270
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:27,463
Uncle,
she is thinking that you are the producer.

271
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,257
Oh no, you tricked me into this!

272
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,160
If 'Pelli Choopulu' movie gets a hit,
producers says that...

273
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,343
-...they want family drama.
-Me?

274
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:36,434
When I work hard and go to
them preparing a story...

275
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:40,931
They say that they want a movie which
has adult content like 'Arjun Reddy'.

276
00:15:41,131 --> 00:15:41,950
Is that me?

277
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,453
Okay, since I feel I might get an
opportunity and get a story order...

278
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:52,488
You say you want a movie with
social content like 'Bharat ane nenu'.

279
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:55,226
-Oh no! Hey Dhana,
-Yeah?

280
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:58,237
she is showing her Ten Avatars and
beating me. Please come down and help me.

281
00:15:58,437 --> 00:15:58,945
No, I won't come,

282
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:01,045
She won't get rid for
her hallucination now!

283
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:01,674
Dhana...

284
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:02,657
Oh my!

285
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:03,999
-Oh my god!
-Hey, stop there man!

286
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:04,811
Stop it dear.

287
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:09,497
I understood, you are the
director as your story is awesome.

288
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:14,252
Tomorrow is the opening,
choose a hero as you like.

289
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:18,378
But I don't care,
I won't do any movie with you.

290
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,999
-Get out from my house.
-Your house?

291
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,453
Fine, save me...

292
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,900
this girl and her
craziness... because of the drink.

293
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:24,840
Oh no!

294
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:26,924
-She and her craziness about films.
-Tasteless fellows.

295
00:16:27,865 --> 00:16:29,249
No one have the clarity.

296
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:31,084
I don't know what they want?

303
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:02,029
Morning! Who is it?

304
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:03,752
I am a producer!

305
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:05,919
Which producer?

306
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:10,087
Are you from Film nagar,
Manikonda, or Srinagar colony?

307
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:11,765
You have never come to our office dear.

308
00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:15,161
Sir, tell me...

309
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:16,226
Are you busy?

310
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:17,458
No sir, tell me.

311
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,954
We are listening to new stories.

312
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:21,050
If you have any story, can you narrate it?

313
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:23,903
Of course sir, please tell me your address
and I will be there in half an hour.

314
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:25,866
[clock ticks, tocks]

315
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:29,002
Hey, Dhana, please come fast.
More how much time it takes?

316
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,048
Have you come?

317
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:33,440
-Hello...
-Hmm?

318
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,093
You dress smart every time!
Why are you dressed like this today?

319
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,696
What's the big deal, we just have
to go and come, right? Let's go.

320
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:46,673
The office looks huge!

321
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,078
Oh my god...

322
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:54,449
the entire Krishna Nagar, Indira Nagar,

323
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:57,040
Film Nagar,
Ganapati complex seems to be here.

324
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,799
How do you think our
story can be confirmed?

325
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,218
Just wasting our time. Let's leave.

326
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:02,707
Why do say that?
This opportunity knocked at our door.

327
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:05,382
We shouldn't say no, there is
nothing wrong in giving it a try please.

328
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,212
Okay, we will go as you are
requesting me. Come on let's go in.

[call bell rings]

330
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:19,343
Anu, do you think there is any
relation between his age and his script?

331
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:20,082
[chuckles]

332
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:21,933
He must have thought this
to be a recycling store.

333
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:24,416
It seems they didn't accept his story.

334
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,468
[call bell rings]

335
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:29,922
-Yes, that's me, I am coming, I am coming.
-Not for us, we have more people waiting.

336
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,822
-Careful, careful.
-Okay.

337
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:39,313
What happened sir?

338
00:18:40,182 --> 00:18:42,011
There are not liking any story.

339
00:18:42,294 --> 00:18:43,915
I guess they already have story in mind.

340
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:49,838
[call bell rings]
Hey, come let us go.

341
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:51,677
-To our home?
-I'll teach you!

342
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:52,902
All the best!

343
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:54,817
[birds chirping]
All: Good morning dear.

344
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:56,129
-Good morning sir!
-Please take your seat.

345
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:57,426
Thank you.

346
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:01,056
We have already heard many stories,

347
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,597
But comparatively the
story we have is the best.

348
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,679
If you are okay,
do a betterment of our story.

349
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:09,123
That way,
we can give you the direction as well.

350
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:10,789
Sure sir, I will give my best.

351
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,693
[music mutes voices]

352
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:26,643
[music continues]

00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,450
[laughs]
[applaud]

354
00:19:37,764 --> 00:19:40,982
Wow! You did a great improvement
of the story in just 10 minutes.

355
00:19:41,182 --> 00:19:42,495
-You're the correct person.
-Yeah!

356
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:43,657
Thank you so much sir.

357
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:46,113
We have rooms
upstairs, why don't stay here

358
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:48,204
and start the script work happily?

359
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:50,885
On minute sir. Please.

360
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:56,723
-Hey Dhana!
-I have already started the bike,

361
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:58,728
come let's go! We are used to this anyway.

362
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:00,573
Hmm... You come here first.

363
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:02,901
[sighs]
What?

364
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,328
-I finally got my 'Director' chance!
-Hey, congrats!

365
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:07,114
Thank you.

366
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:08,536
So I will be the hero in your movie!

367
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:09,984
Hmm...

368
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,884
-So, is that ok with you?
-Sir, okay sir!

369
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:13,454
Today is a very auspicious day to start.
We shall start immediately.

370
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:17,026
But I haven't got any
luggage or clothes with me.

371
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,337
Don't worry, I will go get your stuff.

372
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:21,654
-Are you sure?
-Hmm...

373
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,928
-Okay. Okay, sir!
-Excellent!

374

[vehicles honking]

375
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:32,182
In the first half, my role seems a
little less, but in the second half...

376
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:34,057
[sighs]

377
00:20:34,257 --> 00:20:37,182
Why can't you just tell me
if the story is good or bad?

378
00:20:37,382 --> 00:20:39,878
How will I know
anything about the story is?

379
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,997
I am a hero, not a director!

380
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:43,698
How can you say so?

381
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:45,471
I just can't keep discussing to myself,
isn't it?

382
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:47,364
That true...

383
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:51,734
Then why don't you ask your
writer friend Rajendra to help you!

384
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:53,266
Correct...

385
00:20:53,466 --> 00:20:55,423
-why didn't I get this idea before?
-Good job.

[phone taps]
[phone ringer]

387
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:01,764
Hello Rajendra! Where are you now?

388
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:08,792
Oh... Sure, bye.

389
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:11,169
He is in Vizag now.

390
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:12,922
Think if you know of anyone else.

391
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:17,171
Are you okay with CK?

392
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:18,734
Who is CK?

393
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:20,311
Are you asking me? Who CK is?

394
00:21:20,877 --> 00:21:21,981
Creative Kishore.

395
00:21:23,437 --> 00:21:25,635
Rajamouli's right hand,
Sukumar's full support

396
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:27,635
and the best friend of Surendra Reddy.

397
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:29,697
Do you think he will come?

398
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,358
If you are okay,
it's my responsibility to bring him.

399
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:36,353
OKay, but I cannot pay him
any remuneration, right away.

400
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,915
CK likes me so much.

401
00:21:39,127 --> 00:21:40,541
Leave about his Remuneration.

402
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:43,089
Now, switch off the lights and go sleep.
Will bring CK by tomorrow morning.

403
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:45,143
-Good night, Bye.
-Okay.

404
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:49,115
[vehicles honking]

405
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:54,418
Anu is waiting for him,

406
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,025
time is running out.

407
00:21:56,294 --> 00:22:00,256
Wondering how he is
coming, in an Audi or in a BMW!

408
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:07,963
Why is cab here?
Why brother is coming in a cab?

409
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:11,600
Oh, these small cars! Cabs.!

410
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,370
Namaste Brother, Bless me!

411
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:17,295
-Come brother
-Yesterday, it got very late at Rajamouli.

412
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,874
-Oh!
-The work will be done by today, right!

413
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:20,613
As I need to meet Sukku, tomorrow.

414
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:21,777
You just have to concentrate,
and you can do it in no time.

415
00:22:21,977 --> 00:22:22,553
I have to...

416
00:22:22,753 --> 00:22:24,566
-Brother!
-Oh this can guy needs to be paid!

417
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:25,630
Sorry, Brother... I forgot.

418
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:28,017
-How much?
-Rs. 1250.

419
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:31,791
What? Rs. 1250 to come from
road No. 10 to road No. 11?

420
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:32,693
I forgot to tell you, Dhana!

421
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,033
To get some fresh thoughts,
I made him go around the ring road twice.

422
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:39,359
Dhana, why is that ring road so 'round'?
Just pay him.

423
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,577
Okay brother, okay.

424
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:42,674
-Take it man.
-Total Rs. 1500 sir.

425
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:44,642
What is this brother,
he is now asking for Rs. 1500?

426
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:46,819
Just give it to him,
I got some cigarette packets on the way

427
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:48,066
and I got down to piss too!
Should I tell all?

428
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,896
-No need brother!
-Here, take this and never come around.

429
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,889
-Come brother.
-Why do you worry? I will take care of it.

430
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:58,300
[crow caws]
Who are you?

431
00:23:00,955 --> 00:23:02,417
Who is this 'figure', she is gorgeous!
Is she the heroine?

432
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:04,433
Not heroine brother,
she is our director, Anu.

433
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,905
Oh! Even the directors
are glamorous now a days!

434
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,183
-Is she co-operative?
-Brother, she will kill you!

435
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:12,538
Okay, got hold of a good director.

436
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,582
-I'll give you life.
-Thanks brother.

437
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:16,004
Come in.
[clearing throat]

438
00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:17,773
-Why is she not standing?
-Hey, hi...

439
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:19,417
No need of formalities,
you can stand up and say hi!

440
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:22,910
Why don't we have our breakfast
and then we will sit for work?

441
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,671
Brother,
you didn't had your breakfast, as yet?

442
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:27,565
I told you, I got very late
yesterday, working with Rajamouli!

443
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:29,142
If you want me to give
her the break very fast,

444
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:30,222
then you have to get me some breakfast.

445
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:33,495
Anyways, I am CK, Creative Kishore!

446
00:23:34,085 --> 00:23:37,065
-Anu, nice meeting you.
-Nice meeting you too!

447
00:23:37,322 --> 00:23:38,569
I think your perfume is Zara.

448
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:40,934
I love that too, but I am not
supposed to use a ladies perfume, right!

449
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:41,972
No you should not sir.
[chuckles]

450
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:44,722
Do you know how Rajamouli
got a hit with Bahubali?

451
00:23:45,377 --> 00:23:45,816
How?

452
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:48,939
Just by adding some ghee to a
masala dosa and roasting it...

453
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:50,308
Oh! Is that how he got a hit?

454
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:51,499
We just didn't know!

455
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,856
Bahubali, here! The breakfast is for him.

456
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:54,864
Who are these here?

457
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,457
-Who are these antique pieces?
-They are the producers.

458
00:23:57,657 --> 00:23:59,403
Oh! Heavy budget film I think.

459
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:02,260
But what is the genre? Horror or thriller?

460
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,985
-Action.
-What is the story?

461
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:07,625
-On the opening scene, hero...
-So some misfortune with the hero

462
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,116
and he is trying to take
revenge by killing everyone.

463
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:10,961
and in between few comedy
scenes would come, that's it right?

464
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:14,512
I will give, I will give a nice break.
We will hit it! Hit hard!

465
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:16,132
Producers: What we are thinking is...

466
00:24:16,675 --> 00:24:19,950
You cannot do anything in this
age except thinking. It's a fact.

467
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:22,487
A story is an never ending journey.

468
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,875
Producers should put
the money on the movie,

469
00:24:24,975 --> 00:24:26,324
-take care of publicity.
-Sorry.

470
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:29,225
But, should not interfer in the story.

471
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:31,992
Give some space to the
creative writers! I'll take care...

472
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:33,698
What do you say Dhana?
What don't you say something about me?

473
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:35,208
Don't you know about brother?

474
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:37,493
It was his idea make Prabhas get
on to the elephant in Bahubali,

475
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:40,275
it was this man's idea to cast
Anusuya as Rangamatta in Rangasthalam

476
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,922
and make Seyraa of Uyyalavada
Narsimha Reddy, is all done by brother.

477
00:24:43,022 --> 00:24:45,409
Enough Dhana,
we should not boast about our self!

478
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:47,847
[chuckles]
But one thing, just trust me.

479
00:24:48,335 --> 00:24:49,828
I will give amazing content to the story.

480
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:52,315
I will fresh up and come.
Did you freshen up?

481
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,593
Brother, the rooms are upstairs.

482
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,462
What are you managing?
[chuckles]

483
00:24:58,055 --> 00:24:59,849
Sorry don't mind, I'll be back.

484
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:07,083
Will this dress fit
Brother, yeah it will fit him.

485
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:12,736
Time is running. Yes, brother came.

486
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:15,045
Brother, you did not get any clothes,
isn't it?

487
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,098
So, I got you some producers clothes.

488
00:25:17,709 --> 00:25:18,999
-What brand?
-CK.

489
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,694
-CK, is Calvin Klein right?
-Yes.

490
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:22,008
CK, CK okay.

491
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:23,708
-Smart boy.
-Thank you.

492
00:25:25,228 --> 00:25:25,725
Thank god.

493
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:37,210
-Brother.
-Isn't it a little loose.

494
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:38,956
AC is not working.

495
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:40,515
Can you tell if I
haven't worn an underwear?

496
00:25:41,044 --> 00:25:42,844
I will try to set one by evening.

497
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:44,465
-You got me correctly.
-Please sit.

498
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:45,554
Get me Jockey.

499
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:49,764
Jockey? Would mine fit?

500
00:25:49,835 --> 00:25:50,578
-Sit down Dhana.
-This is okay.

501
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:51,618
Brother?

502
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:53,191
-I will also sit on the floor.
-No Brother, no.

503
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:58,087
I sat in the bathroom and thought well.

504
00:25:58,377 --> 00:25:59,366
In the bathroom?

505
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:03,289
Be it a Bedroom, Police station,
or even when you piss, you have to think.

Brother...

507
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:08,471
How do I stop this?

508
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,385
There is a pause button here, brother.

509
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:12,072
-Will it start from there?
-Yes, it will.

510
00:26:12,794 --> 00:26:14,021
It must have stopped while buffering.

511
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,575
A story is a never ending journey.

512
00:26:16,794 --> 00:26:17,826
This is the time when you have to say,
'super'.

513
00:26:18,085 --> 00:26:18,818
Super, brother.

514
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:20,022
What's the big deal in that Dhana?

515
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:20,939
Just get the set up ready.

516
00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:22,509
Sure brother, I will be back in a minute.

517
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:24,832
You seem to be in a good mood,
will complete the entire story today.

518
00:26:26,527 --> 00:26:29,086
We should see this is an tab,
can't see everything in this.

519
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:29,816
[chuckles]
[Phone: ]

520
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,256
[cleans throat]
Brother...

521
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:39,001
This is not a set up,
Dhana, update yourself.

522
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,077
Try to understand.

523
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:43,699
Brother! To get a girl right
now, is very difficult.

524
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:44,646
Girl?

525
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,190
Oh, you mean drinks?

526
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,253
-Sure, I will get you some drinks.
-Yeah drinks.

527
00:26:50,866 --> 00:26:52,558
Yeah drinks, but remember 'that' also.

528
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:54,778
As a story is an never ending journey,
Dhana.

529
00:26:54,978 --> 00:26:55,609
True, brother.

530
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,784
You ask the producers to come,
we will educate them.

531
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,940
But please remember 'that' in mind.

532
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:02,844
I feel irritated seeing these.

533
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:05,896
Mia Khalifa...

534
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:10,618
Hey, Sunny Leone is back?

535
00:27:10,818 --> 00:27:12,100
[door creaks opens]

536
00:27:13,524 --> 00:27:14,752
-Greetings sir.
-Greetings.

537
00:27:14,985 --> 00:27:15,986
-Sir, greetings.
-It's okay, sit, sit.

538
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,242
I didn't stand up for you,
I am tying my lungi, go sit there.

539
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:24,097
I feel like I am in an old age home.
Very pleasant.

540
00:27:24,663 --> 00:27:25,238
[chiuckles]

541
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:27,875
So what are the latest
movies have you watched?

542
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:29,942
Patala Bhairavi, Aggi Barata.

543
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,018
Nartana Sala, Ramudu Bheemudu.

544
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,103
Oh, you already watched Ramudu Bheemudu?

545
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:36,614
That means, you are Tamil Rockers batch...

546
00:27:36,895 --> 00:27:39,420
-Have you watched anything on TV latest?
-I have watched Mahanati sir.

547
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:41,785
So you are waiting for the next biopic?

548
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,567
Do not watch anything now,
else you will get updated.

549
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,119
You are way too old and
the direct is way to new.

550
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,480
And this Dhana is troubling me.

551
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,365
-In our story...
-Hey get up, get up

552
00:27:52,565 --> 00:27:53,987
get up, I told you I will give you...

553
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:54,734
I will hit it. Hit hard.

554
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:56,977
-Who is he?
-A story is a never ending journey...

555
00:27:57,627 --> 00:27:59,860
I will hit it. Hit hard.
[door creaks opens]

556
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:02,815
-If you hit hard, they'll die.
-You got connected to me very well.

557
00:28:03,585 --> 00:28:04,430
-Saraswati!
-Oh no!

558
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,249
-Are you mad? Remove it...
-Hail lord Shiva!

559
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,093
Remove that as well.

560
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:14,925
Brother,
I have told so much about you to Anu.

561
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:17,231
-What did you tell her?
-That you are so good at giving content.

562
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:18,128
Content?

563
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:20,251
What is there in content?

564
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:22,119
If only she accepts,
I can give her a good life.

565
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,597
-What should she accept?
-The scenes.

566
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,063
Whatever I give,
she has to like it, right?

567
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:28,726
And I will keep trying until she likes.

568
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,185
[gasps]
Dhana, where is the water?

569
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:33,590
-Didn't I get water? Just a minute.
-Do you want me to take it raw?

570
00:28:33,835 --> 00:28:35,489
No... no... you don't drink without water.

571
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,205
[gasps]

572
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:43,598
I already had a quarter? That too raw?

573
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,588
A story is dangerous, Dhana.

574
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:47,927
A story is a never ending journey.

575
00:28:48,585 --> 00:28:51,039
-Go get one half.
-Okay.

576
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,692
I am getting headache please go get it,
get it.

577
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:54,416
[birds chirping]

578
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:58,410
-Hey!
-Yes?

579
00:28:58,926 --> 00:28:59,949
So did he start anything as yet?

580
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,425
He just started now.

581
00:29:02,585 --> 00:29:03,366
Did he at least
complete half of the story?

582
00:29:03,566 --> 00:29:04,769
He is just about to complete half of it.

583
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:07,353
-Ask him to do the full story.
-Full?

584
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:08,487
Yes, I will tell him!

585
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:11,549
I brought this without letting
the producers know, brother.

586
00:29:12,757 --> 00:29:15,136
Dhana, you also get a glass for yourself.

587
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:16,477
We will enjoy advance success.

588
00:29:16,677 --> 00:29:17,967
Brother no, I don't have the habit.

589
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:19,726
-Dhana.
-Brother?

590
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:20,740
-Dhana.
-Brother?

591
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,299
Dhana... Dhana.. Dhana.

592
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:26,267
Brother, I don't have the habit
means, how can I have it in front of you?

593
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,939
What are differences between us, Dhana?

594
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:30,190
We are both common persons.

595
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:31,185
Go get a glass.

596
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:33,844
Just a minute brother, I will get a glass.

597
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,143
If I add a quarter to half, it's not full.

598
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:39,791
[gasps]

599
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:41,764
If you add another half, it's full.
[chuckles]

600
00:29:43,044 --> 00:29:44,202
-You already drank half bottle brother?
-Yeah.

601
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,541
I am in shock myself!

602
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,087
You don't believe I've drunk half, right?

603
00:29:50,594 --> 00:29:52,222
My capacity increased, Dhana.
[chuckles]

604
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,488
Hey! Water is left don't waste the water.

605
00:29:56,877 --> 00:29:57,684
What do you want, brother?

606
00:29:57,944 --> 00:29:59,500
-Go get me a full.
-Ah! Full?

607
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,442
I know you can get it, Dhana.

608
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:03,839
If you get it,
you and I can sit and finish it all.

609
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,033
-What brother?
-The story...

610
00:30:05,752 --> 00:30:08,216
you will be shocked to hear
about the twists in the story.

611
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:12,140
Brother, in the meantime,
you please start the story.

612
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:13,891
Please go and come in the meantime.

613
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:18,869
Please get me a tablet while coming back,
I am getting a headache.

614
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:28,638
Brother, brother, brother...
what is this? At least write Sai Ram!

615
00:30:29,985 --> 00:30:31,050
What is a story? Dhana

616
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:33,028
The never ending journey.

617
00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:34,038
Mix me a peg.

618
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:42,529
Finish.

619
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:45,615
Brother!

620
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:47,102
[snoring]
Brother, brother...

621
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,085
how can you doze off like that?

622
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:50,903
Have a peg and go sleep.
We will talk tomorrow.

623
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,736
Oh no, if you don't write,
she will wage a war with me.

624
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:58,258
If I get up now, you will remind me of
what I have asked you to remember.

625
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,223
A girl! No, brother!

626
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,035
You don't have
to remember anything, good night.

627
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:05,207
I know you will write it
all by morning. My fate!

628
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:11,209
A true writer is one who knows which movie
to write and also which movie to avoid.

629
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:14,295
I am a fan of Adivi Sesh...

630
00:31:19,895 --> 00:31:25,040
[groans]
Dhana...

631
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:26,451
Brother...

632
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,816
What is this Dhana?

633
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:32,256
As you woke up,
I immediately came out of the bathroom.

634
00:31:32,752 --> 00:31:33,628
But what is this Dhana?

635
00:31:34,044 --> 00:31:36,694
Why can't there a night after
night, why should we see a day?

636
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:37,527
If you want that to happen

637
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:40,086
then we ought to be in an
international flight for 24 hrs, brother.

638
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:42,780
International flight means, free liquor!

639
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:44,953
-You impress me so well, Dhana.
-Thanks brother.

640
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,853
We will hit it. Hit it hard.

641
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:50,384
Brother, why is the note pad empty?
Didn't you write anything?

642
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:53,103
Dhana, it's outdated to write on papers.

643
00:31:53,303 --> 00:31:55,366
-Check the two CD's there.
-Ah?

644
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:56,565
-CD's?
-Yes!

645
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:57,165
Brother,

646
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,373
they will think that our cinema is a copy.

647
00:31:59,573 --> 00:32:00,270
Crazy Dhana!

648
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,596
And that is why take the first half of
Jaffa and second half of Vennala 1/2.

649
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,483
Mix both of them and create a new story.
Nobody will know. That's the trend now.

650
00:32:06,806 --> 00:32:08,474
But the story belongs to the producers,
brother.

651
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:10,832
Shut up! Look at them!

652
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:15,008
When asked on which latest movie
watched, he talks about Gutti parota?

653
00:32:15,277 --> 00:32:17,109
It's not Gutti Parota! It's Aggi Barata.

654
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:18,169
That is what I am saying.

655
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,121
They are too old, Mayabazar generation,

656
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,626
they won't even understand these
modern movies. Just go and give it.

657
00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:29,004
Also get me any of the
producers new clothes.

658
00:32:29,627 --> 00:32:34,264
And get me a Jockey underwear, 100 cm.

659
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,206
Not the long type...
get me one with a cut.

660
00:32:38,694 --> 00:32:39,688
-Will get amazing thoughts.
-Okay, brother.

661
00:32:40,044 --> 00:32:41,848
What has a cut to do with new thoughts?

662
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:42,722
I don't understand these writers.

663
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:44,522
Tomorrow, I should ask for a vest.

664
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:01,515
-Anu...
-Ah?

665
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:04,604
What man, was he writing all night?

666
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:06,811
Oh! Did she understand it like that?
[chuckles]

667
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,392
Show me... what did you people write?

668
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:16,875
Om!
It's nice that our writer is religious.

669
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:18,839
I am sure he has completed the script.

670
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:21,050
Let me see.

671
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:23,448
Oh he has done a DTP? Super.

672
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,763
No. He has asked me to use the first half
and second half of two utter flop movies

673
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:29,541
and make a super hit of it.

674
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,238
-Ah!
-Ask him to leave immediately,

675
00:33:34,438 --> 00:33:35,942
else I will kill you.

676
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,484
Dhana!

677
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:38,604
-Oh no!
-Dhana...

678
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:39,594
-Dhana...
-He is calling me again.

679
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,409
[sighs]

680
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,036
-I should invent writers anyhow.
-I am unable to handle his madness.

681
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:46,403
We have to slay him.

682
00:33:46,877 --> 00:33:47,891
What will you make Dosa's?

683
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:51,864
The murder of Creative
Kishore should not be cruel.

684
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,064
It should be creative.
[gasps]

685
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:58,466
Then we will plan the murder in CK style.

686
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:02,295
-Oh no!
-When is fully drunk and asleep,

687
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:05,955
we will softly push a pillow
over his face and kill him.

688
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:07,015
[gasps]

689
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:09,609
He is not a kid to die from a pillow!

690
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:13,925
Take a big boulder and break his head.

691
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:16,260
Shh! Whatever the plan,

692
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,840
it's should be only after
he is fully drunk and asleep.

693
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:21,324
These guys are not producers,
they are professional killers.

694
00:34:24,176 --> 00:34:25,808
Brother...
[groans]

695
00:34:26,008 --> 00:34:26,959
Why did you shout so scarily?

696
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,395
I am just used to shouting like that
as soon as I wake up! It's creative!

697
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:31,533
Oh! Brother,
[gasps]

698
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:34,827
I am on a low budget,
so I got you chilled beer!

699
00:34:35,152 --> 00:34:36,707
We will hit it. Hit it hard.

700
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:37,624
I have quit on the habit of liquor!

701
00:34:37,877 --> 00:34:39,393
-Come on, don't joke.
-Promise!

702
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:41,466
Ram Gopal Varma quitting his publicity

703
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:44,538
and you quitting alcohol is
something not believable.

704
00:34:44,738 --> 00:34:45,288
You should believe...

705
00:34:45,944 --> 00:34:48,736
beacuse Story is an never ending journey.

706
00:34:48,944 --> 00:34:50,937
-I totally understand brother.
-What did you understand?

707
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:53,371
When a Lion is hungry, it won't eat rice.

708
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:56,076
Don't worry I will borrow some
money and get you something.

709
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:58,975
Tell me a good brand of alcohol grandly.

710
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:02,653
This guy here is tempting me, while
ones below are attempting to murder me.

711
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:04,078
-Dhana.
-Brother?

712
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:08,056
One should not get deeply involved
in any subject, what remains is a zero.

713
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:09,272
The script is very important for us.

714
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:11,195
I know, that is what I fear.

715
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:13,707
If you don't drink,
you don't get into the mood of writing!

716
00:35:14,335 --> 00:35:15,113
He doesn't seem to leave me alone.

717
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,379
I should say another way.

718
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,466
-Dhana.
-Brother?

719
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,469
At times, in our lives we
need to listen to our body,

720
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:22,299
when it's saying that you're
going overboard with your capacity.

721
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:24,035
Then we just need to
listen and do our work.

722
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:25,951
Otherwise we just have to lose our life.

723
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:26,780
That's a point to note, brother.

724
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:29,894
Have a pleasant sleep

725
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,294
and then start your script.

726
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:32,516
If I sleep, they will kill me.

727
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:33,325
What did you say brother.

728
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:37,189
I mean no rest and no sleep until I
finish the script. Only night out.

729
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:40,077
Brother it's not Shivaratri
to go sleepless in the night!

730
00:35:40,277 --> 00:35:43,458
Hello, when you have script
work, every night is a Shivaratri.

731
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:45,995
A story... is a never ending journey.

732
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:49,019
-So that journey...
-True, true, you have your own clarity.

733
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:51,608
These oldies also have their own clarity.

734
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,357
We cannot take anything easily.

735
00:35:53,594 --> 00:35:57,166
He does not have any respect for
us, as producers. Is he human?

736
00:35:57,908 --> 00:36:00,162
The story has taken a
U-turn, he quit drinking, it seems.

737
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:01,731
You can't catch me!

738
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,213
Don't take any tension,
once he orders food,

739
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:06,036
we shall mix some poison in it!

740
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,975
-He will be dead.
-Correct.

741
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:11,353
Oh my god! I think they don't want to
get relax until they keep RIP in FB.

742
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:12,748
-I have to escape from here.
-Brother,

743
00:36:13,593 --> 00:36:14,975
I am going out to get food.
Tell me the menu.

744
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:16,125
-I stopped eating food.
-Stopped?

745
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:18,184
-I am fasting!
-What is this brother?

746
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:22,275
I mean I requested Baba in
the night to give Anu a good hit

747
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:24,163
He asked me to do fasting. That is why.

748
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:28,812
Brother, until this day no one has
thought this way for Anu or me.

749
00:36:29,377 --> 00:36:32,631
You not human, you are like the
Mahanubhavudu movie taken by Maruti.

750
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:34,923
-That film is a hit Dhana.
-Okay brother

751
00:36:35,377 --> 00:36:39,068
He is paying respect while
oldies are trying slay me. My fate.

752
00:36:39,372 --> 00:36:41,222
Damn! We missed a chance again.
What do we do now?

753
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:42,858
We have to think about some new plan.

754
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:45,581
Cool, we have coconut oil, right;

755
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,092
we shall pour it all over the stairs

756
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:51,059
and as he steps over, he will slide
down and his soul will reach high up

757
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,829
-How is the idea?
-Super.

758
00:36:53,335 --> 00:36:53,973
What a crap idea!

759
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:56,322
If you pour that oil on your head,
at least that way you can see some hair.

760
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,665
Bloody bald headed people.

761
00:36:58,044 --> 00:36:59,918
I think these people are hurt as
I said this is an old age home.

762
00:37:00,227 --> 00:37:02,958
It just slipped out of my tongue and
these guys have taken it to murder me?

763
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:05,068
The red T-shirt guy is very wild.

764
00:37:05,546 --> 00:37:07,016
I have to escape from this place.

765
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,427
Brother,
I brought you fruits as you are fasting.

766
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:13,671
Is it? Thank you!

767
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,247
Producers have sent these for you.

768
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:16,938
Damn! Just throw them away!
I told you I am fasting, right?

769
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:18,984
But I haven't heard of any
plans to kill me with fruits.

770
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:20,068
What plan, brother?

771
00:37:20,268 --> 00:37:23,570
You are so naive, you don't understand.
They are plotting a plan.

772
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,770
They are not producers,

773
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,725
-they are professional killers.
-Oh my god!

774
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:27,300
You are a kid. What is your age?

775
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:29,266
-If I was born in 1981...
-Why are you counting now?

776
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:30,708
We can write scripts in
the Bhojpuri language.

777
00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:31,448
Come on, let's leave.

778
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:32,955
-Brother.
-We can live watching Nagma.

779
00:37:33,155 --> 00:37:35,869
Get your luggage, we will leave, come on.

780
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:36,824
Brother, brother...

781
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:38,449
there seems to be a misunderstanding.

782
00:37:39,184 --> 00:37:41,207
Oh no! If you jump from here, you will get
injured badly, your will break your legs.

783
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:43,744
-I'll be killed if I stay here.
-No, I won't let you go.

784
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:45,903
Oh man, you're so innocent.

785
00:37:47,151 --> 00:37:48,316
-Oh man, you're so innocent.
-Me and innocent!

786
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:48,847
Look at there once...

787
00:37:49,206 --> 00:37:51,002
-Who is present there?
-I won't leave you 'Gutti Parota'!

788
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:52,962
Brother... Oh no!

789
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,712
[laughing]

790
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,745
He said he will give
the story some content,

791
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,197
but seems to have broken his legs instead.

792
00:37:59,397 --> 00:38:00,104
Producers: What happened?

793
00:38:00,341 --> 00:38:02,308
What more can happen?
Our plan worked out successfully!

794
00:38:02,508 --> 00:38:03,202
[All: laughing]

795
00:38:03,374 --> 00:38:03,894
Success.

796
00:38:06,144 --> 00:38:07,288
-Can you give me that cinema page?
-Good morning sir.

797
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:08,902
-Good morning sir.
-Good morning dear.

798
00:38:09,769 --> 00:38:10,977
-Please sit dear...
-Take your seat dear.

799
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:15,394
Sir, except for the climax part,
the entire story is almost complete.

800
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,222
Can you please listen to the story?

801
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,181
Why don't to finish the climax?

802
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:18,984
Then we can listen to
the entire story at once.

803
00:38:19,184 --> 00:38:23,227
If there are no corrections in the scenes,
then it's easier to write the climax.

804
00:38:23,685 --> 00:38:25,810
Oh yeah, that's true,
go ahead dear, tell us the story.

805
00:38:28,435 --> 00:38:29,935
The name of our movie is 'Kathanam',

806
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:30,935
What does 'Kathanam' mean?

807
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:33,935
The way the story keeps unfolding is
'Kathanam', sir.

808
00:38:34,227 --> 00:38:35,095
Both: Oh!

809
00:38:35,894 --> 00:38:38,352
In this story,
the opening scene has the hero...

810
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:41,702
[music mutes voices]

811
00:39:01,602 --> 00:39:02,727
The story is done until this part, sir.

812
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:04,128
[laughs]
[applaud]

813
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:07,977
Wow, the story is way more
interesting than we actually thought.

814
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:09,288
-Excellent.
-Thank you so much, sir.

815
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:12,370
-But I have a small request sir.
-Yeah, please tell me. It's okay.

816
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:15,644
Sir if I change the location,
I can get new ideas to write the climax.

817
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:17,227
I would like to go, home sir.

818
00:39:18,352 --> 00:39:19,763
-All: Yes, sure dear.
-Okay, dear.

819
00:39:19,963 --> 00:39:21,310
Thank you so much, sir.

820
00:39:21,894 --> 00:39:22,529
-Okay, let's go.
-Come on, let's go.

821
00:39:22,729 --> 00:39:24,579
-I'll see you soon, sir. Thank you!
-Okay. Okay.

822
00:39:24,673 --> 00:39:25,221
Come on, let's go.

823
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,685
It's a big surprise to me!

824
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,435
I dreamt of being a
director and it has come true.

825
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,727
But there is a bigger surprise,
waiting for me. And I have no clue of it.

826
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:39,269
What's that surprise?

827
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:47,608
Oh my god!
[birds chirping]

828
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,769
-Dhana!
-Oh no!

829
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:53,102
Why are you shouting
like someone has died.

830
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:55,894
-Read.
-Yeah, what's there in this?

831
00:39:56,602 --> 00:40:00,019
'DSP's death caused by leaking
gas cylinder', so what's there?

832
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:01,519
Read properly!

833
00:40:03,394 --> 00:40:05,596
[murmuring]
[Reading Telugu news paper]

834
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:09,125
What is this?
This murder is straight out of our script!

835
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,644
Exactly! It's totally going over my head.

836
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:12,128
-Let's go the crime scene once please.
-Hey!

837
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:13,270
Why do you want to get into this?
It's a headache.

838
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,193
Please let us go once,
we will get some clarity about it.

839
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:17,357
What kind of clarity do you want?
If he is dead or we killed him?

840
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:18,185
[sighs]

841
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,729
We are going, that's it!

842
00:40:22,131 --> 00:40:22,677
Huh!

843
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,790
Dhana, cops are there.
What do you think we should?

844
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:30,744
You go... I will manage.

845
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:31,869
-Are you sure?
-Hmm...

846
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:43,615
[birds chirping]
I must have fell down here itself...

847
00:40:45,102 --> 00:40:46,352
Hey, what are searching there?

848
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:50,435
Sir, my ring fell here,
I am looking for it. It's very valuable.

849
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,894
-Is it?
-Yes.

850
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:56,269
Where is it? I don't find it here.

851
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,977
Sir, it's right on my hand.
I did not lose it.

852
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,603
Is it this? You looking for this?

853
00:41:03,703 --> 00:41:07,103
Sir, you don't
understand the value of this ring,

854
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:08,386
it has been given by my
childhood love Sailaja in school.

855
00:41:08,705 --> 00:41:10,097
Crazy fellow... get lost!

856
00:41:10,453 --> 00:41:12,131
-Witticism, right in the morning.
-Okay.

857
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:03,935
Sir, I will explain how the hero has
planned the murder without getting caught!

858
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:09,077
Hero makes sure to go to
DSP's house when he is not around.

859
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:12,639
He closes the kitchen
tap with wax like this.

860
00:42:13,682 --> 00:42:17,644
Once the wax is dry, the hero opens
the tap, but the water doesn't flow,

861
00:42:18,727 --> 00:42:22,269
Then he makes a small hole with a needle.

862
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:29,060
Then he takes a plate and makes sure
the water drops fall on the plate slowly.

863
00:42:30,269 --> 00:42:34,029
The plate falls down
because of loss of balance.

864
00:42:35,477 --> 00:42:38,788
'He switched on the kitchen
lights to know what was happening.'

865
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:39,530
[switch ticks on]
[electric crackles]

866
00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:41,704
By this time the gas has leaked
already as planned by the hero

867
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:44,365
and ignites upon switching the light.
A blast at once.

868
00:42:57,269 --> 00:42:58,763
You think I am kid to believe that...

869
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:00,449
whatever happened in
already in your script?

870
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:05,827
Believe it or not! I have written
it and that's what happened.

871
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:07,079
Why can't you just think
that this is a coincidence?

872
00:43:07,477 --> 00:43:10,104
I felt so too,
but not until the second murder happened!

873
00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:11,782
-Second murder?
-Hmm...

874
00:43:12,227 --> 00:43:14,935
The case of retired IAS officer which is
closed stating it to be a suicide case!

875
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,977
You mean retired IAS officer, Praskash?

876
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,852
Yes sir.

877
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:22,685
How do you know that it's a suicide?

878
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:25,644
I don't know sir,
that is how I have written!

879
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:27,891
A retired IAS officer gets murdered

880
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:30,172
and the police close it
stating it to be a suicide.

881
00:43:30,486 --> 00:43:30,924
[chuckles]

882
00:43:31,227 --> 00:43:32,431
While you write that in your script

883
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:34,587
and you think the same
is happening in reality?

884
00:43:35,016 --> 00:43:35,519
Hmm...

885
00:43:36,102 --> 00:43:37,894
Do you think you are Nostradamus?

886
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:41,035
You think these enquires and
investigations made by trained officers

887
00:43:41,235 --> 00:43:41,662
are all wrong?

888
00:43:41,894 --> 00:43:43,894
You think your script is the only reality?

889
00:43:44,977 --> 00:43:47,935
No sir, I am only telling you
what I know regarding the case.

890
00:43:48,644 --> 00:43:50,239
Please, can you tell what
investigations have been done?

891
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:52,009
Have you come to do some enquiry on me?

892
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:53,294
What is the connection
between your story and this case?

893
00:43:53,602 --> 00:43:55,268
I am asking you because there
is a connection! Please!

894
00:43:57,154 --> 00:43:58,201
[calling bell rings]

895
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:02,852
Sir...

896
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:05,485
-Get me the file of the IAS officer.
-Okay sir.

897
00:44:10,152 --> 00:44:11,685
-Sir...
-Thank you!

898
00:44:19,144 --> 00:44:19,971
On the day of his death,

899
00:44:20,335 --> 00:44:22,157
the officer landed
from Delhi and went straight to the club.

900
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:24,075
He along with his friends had
some heavy booze that night.

901
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:27,578
His wife had a fight
because of his drinking habit.

902
00:44:27,778 --> 00:44:31,185
In the heat of the argument,
he went to his room and locked the door.

903
00:44:34,852 --> 00:44:38,727
His wife brought him food and
knocked the door, but he didn't open.

904
00:44:38,935 --> 00:44:43,727
She left as it was a usual
thing for her every day.

905
00:44:43,936 --> 00:44:46,718
Though retired, he was very unhappy
about his wife and went into depression.

906
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:48,550
Because he has boozed a lot that day,

907
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,730
this led him to jump from his
balcony and commit suicide.

908
00:44:54,185 --> 00:44:56,019
Is this enough?
Or do you need some more information?

909
00:44:56,269 --> 00:44:59,710
Being an IAS officer when
he faced so many issues...

910
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:00,993
just because he has
some issues with his wife,

911
00:45:01,193 --> 00:45:02,683
officer would commit suicide in rage?

912
00:45:02,977 --> 00:45:04,375
How could you believe it so easily?

913
00:45:04,575 --> 00:45:06,546
We have closed this case after
carefully investigating everyone.

914
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,268
Whom did you investigate?
What did you enquire?

915
00:45:09,477 --> 00:45:11,686
We have investigated all the
officers related to the case.

916
00:45:11,886 --> 00:45:13,088
His wife, friends...

917
00:45:13,288 --> 00:45:15,437
all have been investigated and
then we have closed the case.

918
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:17,283
When you have enquired so many people?

919
00:45:17,644 --> 00:45:19,763
How can you forget
enquiring his family doctor?

920
00:45:19,963 --> 00:45:21,667
If you enquire him...
then you'll get new things.

921
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:24,977
-What has a doctor to do with this case?
-There is a relation!

922
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:27,435
Call the doctor and you
will understand it yourself.

923
00:45:29,892 --> 00:45:30,917
[calling bell rings]

924
00:45:34,602 --> 00:45:36,628
Find out who the family
doctor of the IAS officer is?

925
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:38,276
Connect him to me immideatly.

926
00:45:39,377 --> 00:45:39,805
Ok sir.

927
00:45:45,269 --> 00:45:46,689
Sir, he is on line.

928
00:45:47,935 --> 00:45:50,060
Hello doctor, I am ACP Ranadhir speaking.

929
00:45:50,102 --> 00:45:50,746
Tell me sir.

930
00:45:50,946 --> 00:45:53,378
Wasn't the dead IAS officer Prakash,
your patient?

931
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:53,902
Yes, sir.

932
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:57,352
How was his mental and
physical health just before his death?

933
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:04,894
Thank you doctor.

934
00:46:07,685 --> 00:46:10,829
According to the doctor he was suffering
from a disease called Somnambulism...

935
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:13,911
and the medicines administered
for depression and anxiety...

936
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,098
...can in no way can
lead him to commit suicide.

937
00:46:16,198 --> 00:46:18,119
Prakash's Somnambulism disease...

938
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:20,698
but what is relation
between this and his death?

939
00:46:20,898 --> 00:46:21,680
Of course, there is a relation, sir.

940
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,517
Somnambulism is sleep walking disorder.

941
00:46:24,717 --> 00:46:26,154
Non rapid eye moment sleep.

942
00:46:26,394 --> 00:46:32,154
In layman's language, it's sleep
walking in deep dreamless sleep.

943
00:46:33,435 --> 00:46:37,866
He is used to walking to
the bathroom in his sleep.

944
00:46:39,352 --> 00:46:42,890
Having understood this,
the hero turned the bed in such a way...

945
00:46:43,185 --> 00:46:45,629
that the officer opened the balcony
door instead of his bathroom door

946
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:47,603
and jumped off the balcony and died.

947
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:53,977
So who do you think has killed him?

948
00:46:54,477 --> 00:46:55,560
This is what you have to investigate.

949
00:46:58,019 --> 00:46:58,769
You wanna coffee?

950
00:46:59,727 --> 00:47:00,977
Black and strong, please!

[calling bell rings]

952
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:09,894
Thank you.

953
00:47:11,297 --> 00:47:16,468
[phone rings]
Excuse me.

954
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:18,352
Hello...

955
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:20,810
I was just about to call you.

956
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:25,310
Your doubt about Prakash's case
being a murder is absolutely right.

957
00:47:25,685 --> 00:47:28,185
I will meet you as
soon as I solve this case.

958
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:34,586
What is the relation
between the two murder cases...

959
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:38,347
...your visit to the
hospital and the doctor Anitha's death?

960
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,852
I was petrified as to what
might happen after the two murders.

961
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:46,727
I know no body would believe me.
If say this to anyone.

962
00:47:47,644 --> 00:47:49,767
Instead of wasting time
trying to convince someone,

963
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,564
it was better to take
care of the situation myself.

964
00:47:53,102 --> 00:47:56,852
So you visited the
hospital to save Dr. Anitha?

965
00:47:57,269 --> 00:47:57,769
Yes.

966
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:00,185
How did you know the next in
line to be murdered is Dr. Anitha?

967
00:48:02,727 --> 00:48:03,644
I found out.

968
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:06,298
[distant siren wailing]
[distant vehicle honking]

969
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:08,947
[sighs]

970
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:17,261
Anu, why are you so worried about the
two murders as if you have done them?

971
00:48:17,627 --> 00:48:19,556
I am not worries about the two murders,

972
00:48:20,342 --> 00:48:22,109
I am worried if the third
murder will happen as well.

973
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:26,912
Shall we give a police complaint?

974
00:48:27,152 --> 00:48:28,879
Do you think the police
are crazy to believe that,

975
00:48:29,017 --> 00:48:31,133
the murders are exactly
happening just like in our script?

976
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,935
You and I can be jailed for this!
This isn't a correct idea.

977
00:48:34,065 --> 00:48:36,857
Look... we had no clue of the
two murders that happened.

978
00:48:37,195 --> 00:48:39,732
I am just concerned about how we can
stop the third murder from taking place.

979
00:48:40,352 --> 00:48:42,554
How can we know anything
about the third person?

980
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,876
Of how he is, where he is or what he does?

981
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:49,557
You know what!
Not only does the characters of the script

982
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:51,492
and murders match, but also their names!

983
00:48:54,019 --> 00:48:57,981
-That means, the doctor's name is...
-Yes, Dr. Anitha.

984
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:00,519
Anitha...

985
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:06,352
Open the All India Medical
Association of Telangana website.

986
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:12,666
Since the story is based out in Hyderabad,

987
00:49:13,499 --> 00:49:15,569
get the list of the top
cardiologist in the city...

988
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,435
Here is the list, Anu.

989
00:49:21,685 --> 00:49:24,207
There are three people with that name,

990
00:49:24,826 --> 00:49:25,407
Anitha Agarwal,
Anitha Reddy, Anitha Kumari!

991
00:49:30,352 --> 00:49:32,019
Tell me the number of Anitha Agarwal.

992
00:49:32,077 --> 00:49:34,339
Hmm... 96180

993
00:49:34,629 --> 00:49:36,274
05050.

994
00:49:36,716 --> 00:49:38,509
-5050.
-Hmm.

995
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,543
Hello could I speak to
Anitha Agarwal please...

996
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:46,277
She is in US, ma'am.

997
00:49:47,935 --> 00:49:49,144
Oh! Okay, thanks.

998
00:49:50,144 --> 00:49:51,310
She is in the US.

999
00:49:51,477 --> 00:49:53,227
That means, she is safe.

1000
00:49:53,935 --> 00:49:54,727
Next!

1001
00:49:55,127 --> 00:49:59,580
Anitha Reddy... 9177747225.

1002
00:50:00,451 --> 00:50:01,196
-225.
-5!

1003
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,034
-Hello, is it Ms. Anitha Reddy?-Yes, speaking.

1004
00:50:07,552 --> 00:50:09,784
-I need your appointment, madam.-Sorry, I am travelling.

1005
00:50:10,144 --> 00:50:11,352
Okay, thank you.

1006
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:12,950
She is in journey.

1007
00:50:13,264 --> 00:50:14,680
So she is also safe.

1008
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,352
There is no personal
number here of Anitha Kumari.

1009
00:50:21,669 --> 00:50:22,727
But there only the hospitals number.

1010
00:50:23,102 --> 00:50:24,177
-We'll try.
-Yeah.

00:50:29,352 --> 00:50:29,894
Okay.

1013
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:32,096
-Hello...-Yes, madam.

1014
00:50:32,352 --> 00:50:33,403
Is Anitha Kumari there?

1015
00:50:33,727 --> 00:50:35,570
-Yes, she is available.
-I need to meet her.

1016
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,751
Do you have any appointment?

1017
00:50:36,977 --> 00:50:38,940
Appointment... No!

1018
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,642
Sorry madam, you cannot meet
her without an appointment.

1019
00:50:43,685 --> 00:50:45,185
-She is the one.
-Sure?

1020
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,352
Yeah... let's go! Come on.

1021
00:50:48,227 --> 00:50:49,852
After that, you know all that happened!

1022
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,269
She died in front of my
eyes and I couldn't do any thing.

1023
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:57,951
Sir, doctors post-mortem report.

1024
00:50:58,151 --> 00:50:58,551
Okay.

1025
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,477
I will tell you what's in
that post-mortem report.

1026
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,977
Air embolism in hear.,

1027
00:51:09,185 --> 00:51:10,477
Air embolism in heart?

1028
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:12,195
An air bubble in the heart vessel

1029
00:51:12,395 --> 00:51:13,515
because of which the blood
supply to the heart is hindered...

1030
00:51:13,627 --> 00:51:15,685
this causes a cardiac arrest and death.

1031
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:19,769
How did an air bubble get into
her heart vessel all of a sudden?

1032
00:51:20,269 --> 00:51:22,560
Dr. Anitha suffers from Narcolepsy.

1033
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,448
And for which she has been
taking an Ephedrine injection...

1034
00:51:24,732 --> 00:51:26,310
...every day for the past 10 years.

1035
00:51:26,727 --> 00:51:28,269
It's an intravenous injection.

1036
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,894
One should be careful to administer it
without any air bubble in the injection.

1037
00:51:32,644 --> 00:51:34,130
The hero made sure she was in a hurry...

1038
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,477
...and had no time to check that
before she took that injection.

1039
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,849
So that's how an air
bubble got into her veins.

1040
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:42,663
The post-mortem report says...

1041
00:51:42,863 --> 00:51:45,160
death was caused by air
bubble reaching the heart vessel.

1042
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,514
Is that what you have
written in your script?

1043
00:51:47,477 --> 00:51:48,435
Hmm... yes.

1044
00:51:50,227 --> 00:51:51,810
Does anyone else know
this script apart from you?

1045
00:51:52,894 --> 00:51:56,519
My friend who is waiting outside and
the four producers to whom I narrated.

1046
00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:59,513
So the murders are all
happening according to the story...

1047
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,834
...of the producers and
your script 'Kathanam'!

1048
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:03,185
Yes.

1049
00:52:07,602 --> 00:52:08,435
Let's go.

1050
00:52:08,977 --> 00:52:09,530
Where?

1051
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,608
Let's go the place where it all started.

1052
00:52:17,946 --> 00:52:20,607
[siren wailing]

1053
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:26,059
[tires screeching]
[car doors opens and closes]

1054
00:52:31,144 --> 00:52:32,519
Is this the house of the
producers you were saying?

1055
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:33,935
Yes.

1056
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:37,185
It's seems very old and untouched.

1057
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:39,685
That is what I am
unable to understand sir.

1058
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:44,348
[cicadas chirping]
[pistol fires]

1059
00:52:44,977 --> 00:52:45,560
Open it!

1060
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:48,655
[door latch rattles]
[door creak opens]

1061
00:52:51,396 --> 00:52:51,909
[coughs]

1062
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,030
[shouts]

1063
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:11,696
[gasps]

1064
00:53:20,227 --> 00:53:23,227
Did you narrate your story here?
It's all old stuff and creepy.

1065
00:53:23,477 --> 00:53:24,352
What is there here?

1066
00:53:24,394 --> 00:53:26,977
There used to be a big sofa here, sir.

1067
00:53:27,225 --> 00:53:29,500
The producers sat here,
while I sat there and narrated the story.

1068
00:53:32,019 --> 00:53:34,287
Believe it or not!
What I am telling you the truth!

1069
00:53:34,602 --> 00:53:35,666
What is true and what's not?

1070
00:53:35,894 --> 00:53:37,451
You spoke of produces,
script and you are telling me a story?

1071
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:38,416
I came here just because I trusted you!

1072
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:41,031
-Please believe me.
-There is nothing here to believe you.

1073
00:53:43,269 --> 00:53:46,519
It's true and that I narrated
the script to four producers.

1074
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:47,737
It's true that they give me
the direction of the movie

1075
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:48,782
and it's true that I even
accepted an advance for the film.

1076
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:50,847
-Hey, shoot him.
-Ah!

1077
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,526
[pistol fires]
[flower pot shatters]

1078
00:53:53,394 --> 00:53:53,840
Fire...

1079
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:57,102
[pistol fires]

1080
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,060
Come on...

1081
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,494
[pistol reloading]
[pistol fires]

1082
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:02,955
[pistol fires]

1083
00:54:06,134 --> 00:54:07,816
[pistol reloading]
[pistol fires]

1084
00:54:24,144 --> 00:54:24,935
Anu...

1085
00:54:42,355 --> 00:54:42,772
Anu?

1086
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:43,572
Huh...

1087
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,689
How are you feeling?

1088
00:54:48,105 --> 00:54:48,647
Not bad.

1089
00:54:49,772 --> 00:54:50,772
You have a beautiful house.

1090
00:54:50,897 --> 00:54:52,730
Coffee will be even better... Have it.

1091
00:54:54,022 --> 00:54:55,064
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

1092
00:54:59,577 --> 00:55:01,609
-Hmm...
-Anu...

1093
00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:03,186
Based on what you said,

1094
00:55:03,374 --> 00:55:05,666
only those four producers
has the need to kill you.

1095
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:07,064
Their target is you.

1096
00:55:07,397 --> 00:55:10,799
If we are to solve the case,
you have to be safe Anu.

1097
00:55:10,999 --> 00:55:11,835
[sighs]

1098
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,578
-Anu
-Hmm...

1099
00:55:16,778 --> 00:55:17,689
What are you thinking?

1100
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:21,564
I'm wondering what's going to happen to my
career which I had many dreams about it.

1101
00:55:21,764 --> 00:55:22,365
[scoffs]

1102
00:55:23,105 --> 00:55:25,772
Don't worry, Anu. All the
problems will be resolved soon.

1103
00:55:25,939 --> 00:55:27,564
Till then, both of you can stay here.

1104
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:31,105
Well, don't your family members
feel inconvenience if we stay here?

1105
00:55:32,305 --> 00:55:33,222
I don't have a family.

1106
00:55:34,455 --> 00:55:36,914
My parents died in an
accident during my childhood.

1107
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,189
Oh! So you are an orphan, just like us?

1108
00:55:40,189 --> 00:55:41,980
[scoofs] Why will I be an
orphan? Now, I have you guys.

1109
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,460
Well...
That's alright...

1110
00:55:44,728 --> 00:55:46,799
But when we saw your
policemen in the police station,

1111
00:55:46,924 --> 00:55:49,248
we are sceptical about
trusting a policeman.

1112
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:49,772
Dhana!

1113
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,314
Nice coffee!

1114
00:55:51,772 --> 00:55:54,022
Okay.
Anu, I'll prepare lunch.

1115
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:57,480
Well, I'll prepare it.
-No chance until you are fully recovered.

1116
00:55:58,064 --> 00:55:58,863
Come along...

1117
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:00,438
Let's discuss about the
friendship with a policeman

1118
00:56:00,538 --> 00:56:01,621
while preparing lunch in the kitchen.

1119
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:02,678
I don't know how to cook.

1120
00:56:02,754 --> 00:56:06,778
According to penal code,
section number 420, 120, 21, 92...

1121
00:56:06,851 --> 00:56:07,544
-Err... Kitchen is that way, right?
-Come...

1122
00:56:07,604 --> 00:56:09,498
Come on, I will make
the delicious Dal curry.

1123
00:56:09,524 --> 00:56:10,150
You said you didn't know how to cook.

1124
00:56:15,148 --> 00:56:21,076
[music mutes voice]

1125
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:29,805
[vehicle starts]

1126
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:38,720
[sighs]

1127
00:56:38,814 --> 00:56:41,689
It's an air-conditioned floor in the name
but not even fans are in working condition

1128
00:56:41,814 --> 00:56:43,730
If this is the case,
how would my glamour last?

1129
00:56:44,272 --> 00:56:45,605
-Hey, Dhana!
-Sir.

1130
00:56:45,689 --> 00:56:47,182
-Come here.
-I have learnt the dialogue sir.

1131
00:56:47,374 --> 00:56:48,863
-A security guard mean...
-That's not what I want to talk about.

1132
00:56:48,963 --> 00:56:49,458
Be seated.

1133
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,801
-Do you want me to sit?
-Come sit here man. Sit.

1134
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:56,122
You know there is a lot of talk about
your friend Anu in the industry.

1135
00:56:56,314 --> 00:56:58,772
Police, cases etc. What is all this?

1136
00:56:59,064 --> 00:57:00,855
Sir, what really happened was...

1137
00:57:02,612 --> 00:57:03,856
[gunshot]

1138
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,085
Even a small error by a person from the
movie industry is magnified by the public.

1139
00:57:08,765 --> 00:57:10,687
-Tell her to be careful.
-Alright, sir.

1140
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,022
She has a great potential to be a very big
director in the industry, in the future.

1141
00:57:12,192 --> 00:57:14,210
Okay, sir. [phone rings]

1142
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,994
-Sir, just a moment.
-Okay. Satish!

1143
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:19,821
-Anu?
-Dhana.

1144
00:57:19,997 --> 00:57:21,325
-What did the doctor say?-Okay...

1145
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,189
Doctor removed the bandage.
He said there would be no problem.

1146
00:57:24,605 --> 00:57:26,314
The hand moves more freely now.

1147
00:57:26,439 --> 00:57:27,635
Okay, be careful.

1148
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:28,732
After I am done with the
shooting, I will head home.

1149
00:57:28,808 --> 00:57:29,618
Dhana... Shot ready.

1150
00:57:29,678 --> 00:57:31,054
-Anu, I'll call you later.-Okay, bye.

1151
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,552
Bye.

1152
00:57:44,482 --> 00:57:45,275
-Anu...
-Huh.

1153
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,611
What are you doing in my room?

1154
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,241
Who are these two?

1155
00:57:49,322 --> 00:57:52,026
These two guys are the
reason I am in this big mess today.

1156
00:57:52,189 --> 00:57:53,100
You mean, these two?

1157
00:57:54,147 --> 00:57:54,725
Yes.

1158
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,861
These are two out of the four producers
to whom I have narrated the story.

1159
00:57:59,611 --> 00:58:01,515
I thought they might be
able to help with the case.

1160
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:03,221
I thought about it the whole
night and came up with this sketch.

1161
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:05,250
It's now easier to nab them, sir.

1162
00:58:05,522 --> 00:58:06,742
They are not so easy to catch.

1163
00:58:06,842 --> 00:58:08,249
They've ensured that they made
our investigation team find

1164
00:58:08,305 --> 00:58:12,697
no clue at the place where they
attacked us or its surroundings.

1165
00:58:13,017 --> 00:58:14,689
How do you think they
would get to us so easily?

1166
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:17,193
Does that mean we will
not be able to catch them?

1167
00:58:17,214 --> 00:58:17,814
We can catch them.

1168
00:58:18,455 --> 00:58:21,071
-How?
-What's the next activity in your story?

1169
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,605
-Another murder.
-What? Another murder? Who?

1170
00:58:24,855 --> 00:58:26,730
-A VIP.
-Who is the VIP?

1171
00:58:27,853 --> 00:58:29,932
I don't know. I just wrote VIP.

1172
00:58:30,605 --> 00:58:31,104
Where?

1173
00:58:31,865 --> 00:58:33,111
At a traffic signal.

1174
00:58:34,017 --> 00:58:36,299
A transformer bursts
at a traffic signal...

1175
00:58:36,321 --> 00:58:36,765
When?

1176
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:39,043
-I don't know.
-Crap!

1177
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:47,764
Just because there is a
pen and paper available,

1178
00:58:48,036 --> 00:58:49,608
you wrote that a VIP would be
murdered at a traffic signal

1179
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:51,104
how can we save them?

1180
00:58:56,855 --> 00:58:58,314
Do you even know when this
murder is going to take place?

1181
00:58:59,647 --> 00:59:00,189
No.

1182
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:04,522
Do you at least know the dates in
which those three murders took place?

1183
00:59:05,522 --> 00:59:05,939
Anu...

1184
00:59:09,147 --> 00:59:12,897
5th, 3... 14th and 19th

1185
00:59:14,314 --> 00:59:17,328
5th, 14th and 19th...

1186
00:59:19,397 --> 00:59:23,614
5th, 14th and 19th...

1187
00:59:25,064 --> 00:59:25,691
Yes...

1188
00:59:41,372 --> 00:59:42,034
5th...

1189
00:59:42,126 --> 00:59:43,799
5th... If the first murder took place

1190
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:46,343
on the 5th that means
alphabetically it's an 'A'.

1191
00:59:46,622 --> 00:59:50,530
The next murder... 14th is 'N'.

1192
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:55,772
3rd murder... 3rd murder... The 3rd
murder is on 19th, that means 'S'.

1193
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:12,029
5th: East,
14th: North,

1194
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:15,149
19th: South and
23rd: West.

1195
01:00:16,271 --> 01:00:16,792
Yes.

1196
01:00:18,287 --> 01:00:20,720
5th: East,
14th: North,

1197
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:24,232
19th: South and
23rd: West.

1198
01:00:24,714 --> 01:00:27,292
The fourth murder is
going to take place on 23rd.

1199
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:29,740
What is today's date?

1200
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:31,040
22nd.

1201
01:00:31,439 --> 01:00:33,355
So, tomorrow is when the fourth
murder is going to take place.

1202
01:00:33,939 --> 01:00:37,230
Oh dear, these old men!
What a devious plan!

1203
01:00:40,183 --> 01:00:40,690
[camera clicks]

1204
01:00:43,299 --> 01:00:43,714
[camera clicks]

1205
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,302
[phone rings]

1206
01:00:46,864 --> 01:00:47,279
Sir

1207
01:00:47,379 --> 01:00:48,714
I am sending you two
photographs on Whatsapp.

1208
01:00:48,814 --> 01:00:49,298
Sir

1209
01:00:49,398 --> 01:00:50,964
Send it across all the police
stations and get an enquiry in place.

1210
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:51,489
Okay, sir.

1211
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:53,717
Wherever there are transformers
beside a traffic signal in the city,

1212
01:00:53,741 --> 01:00:54,764
-get them checked.
-Okay, sir.

1213
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:56,361
I want the entire information immediately.

1214
01:01:00,272 --> 01:01:03,089
Sir, we have sent the photographs to
all the police stations as you instructed.

1215
01:01:03,189 --> 01:01:04,856
We may get the information
at any time, sir.

1216
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:05,428
Okay.

1217
01:01:05,515 --> 01:01:08,722
Our agents have taken all the information
regarding the transformers in the city,

1218
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,258
from TRANSCO.

1219
01:01:10,287 --> 01:01:10,692
Okay.

1220
01:01:11,897 --> 01:01:12,927
This is the map of the city.

1221
01:01:13,261 --> 01:01:16,152
All the red colour dots on this
map are electric transformers.

1222
01:01:16,772 --> 01:01:18,269
The tick marks are

1223
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:22,205
the transformers at the junction of
crossroads that you have asked for.

1224
01:01:23,105 --> 01:01:23,878
What are total number of transformers?

1225
01:01:24,978 --> 01:01:25,753
22, sir.

1226
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:30,088
Sir, we've enquired regarding the
lanes surrounding the transformers

1227
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,992
where VIPs travel in
these routes, as you said.

1228
01:01:32,326 --> 01:01:33,270
Hmm... Good!

1229
01:01:33,782 --> 01:01:36,730
Only 3 VIPs live around these
surroundings of the transformers, sir.

1230
01:01:36,775 --> 01:01:38,251
And they are not going
to be in the city tomorrow.

1231
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:39,137
Okay.

1232
01:01:39,815 --> 01:01:41,543
So, apart from these three,

1233
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:43,041
we need to find out if there
are any other VIPs in the city

1234
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:46,768
who take the routes that have
these 22 transformers tomorrow.

1235
01:01:47,573 --> 01:01:50,611
Okay. Enquire with the Ministers'
OSD and secretaries of MPs and MLAs

1236
01:01:50,687 --> 01:01:51,867
and find out their schedule of tomorrow.

1237
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:53,048
-Come on, quick! Okay, fast.
-Okay, sir.

1238
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:04,027
Sir, there are a total of 6 VIPs
including a state cabinet minister

1239
01:02:04,282 --> 01:02:07,163
who'd be taking the routes in which
we have identified the transformers.

1240
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,132
Sir, I have a small idea.

1241
01:02:09,432 --> 01:02:11,758
Why don't we talk to these 6 VIPs and
request them to change their schedule?

1242
01:02:11,858 --> 01:02:12,994
Hey! What nonsense are you talking?

1243
01:02:13,194 --> 01:02:14,528
Should I tell them that a girl wrote
a story and according to the story,

1244
01:02:14,736 --> 01:02:15,898
they're going to get blown up and die

1245
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,105
if they take the routes with
transformers at the junctions tomorrow?

1246
01:02:17,605 --> 01:02:19,689
They won't believe me and I would
end up a laughing stock instead.

1247
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:20,967
Correct!

1248
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:22,572
On top of that, if media
gets a hint of this,

1249
01:02:22,648 --> 01:02:23,708
there is a likelihood that
the public would be disturbed.

1250
01:02:23,752 --> 01:02:24,477
Yes, you are right.

1251
01:02:24,812 --> 01:02:26,839
Sir, it would be difficult
to conduct a rescue operation

1252
01:02:27,047 --> 01:02:31,591
at the six transformers at the city
centre, without their cooperation.

1253
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:32,911
Yes, this is what I was thinking about.

1254
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:34,129
Among those six transformers,

1255
01:02:34,252 --> 01:02:37,073
if we can identify the one
which is going to get blown up...

1256
01:02:37,273 --> 01:02:37,976
How can we identify that, sir?

1257
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,103
She should tell me that.

1258
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,605
Sir, I have already told
you everything that I wrote.

1259
01:02:41,814 --> 01:02:42,599
Well, that not what I meant, Anu.

1260
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:44,867
You might've written something about the
surroundings of the particular transformer

1261
01:02:44,959 --> 01:02:48,208
or perhaps some landmarks in your scene.

1262
01:02:48,308 --> 01:02:49,471
Try to recollect.

1263
01:02:50,415 --> 01:02:55,085
I did not write any landmarks but
there is a cafe near that transformer.

1264
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:57,026
At the exact moment of the blast,

1265
01:02:57,272 --> 01:03:01,736
the hero would be watching the death
of the VIP and enjoying a cup of tea.

1266
01:03:02,047 --> 01:03:03,554
Cafe... That's a clue.

1267
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:07,407
Find out the cafes surrounding
these transformers and inform me.

1268
01:03:07,607 --> 01:03:13,594
[music]
[traffic]

1269
01:03:34,716 --> 01:03:35,196
Thank you

1270
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:37,649
-No, thanks.
-No, thanks.

1271
01:03:39,564 --> 01:03:41,772
Do you think everything will go
according to what we guessed?

1272
01:03:42,096 --> 01:03:44,736
If all the other murders
happened according to your script,

1273
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:45,840
this will happen as well.

1274
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:48,328
But only if the VIP arrives.

1275
01:03:48,406 --> 01:03:52,163
What if the senior citizens change
the plan knowing that we are here?

1276
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:53,229
Umm...

1277
01:03:55,247 --> 01:03:56,814
[indistinct voice in walkie talkie]
Yes, Srikanth.

1278
01:03:56,855 --> 01:03:59,889
We've received information that no VIP is
taking the route that you are stationed at

1279
01:04:00,222 --> 01:04:02,019
But, I just received an
information that a Central Minister is

1280
01:04:02,207 --> 01:04:04,579
passing through the Vittalwadi Crossroads,
next to the area that you are stationed at

1281
01:04:04,897 --> 01:04:07,305
Srikanth, I will be there in 5 minutes.
Stop the minister from going forward.

1282
01:04:07,397 --> 01:04:08,190
-Okay, sir.
-Okay.

1283
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:09,841
Sir, we would like to come with
you as well. [vehicle starts]

1284
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:11,175
Both of you stay here.

1285
01:04:11,605 --> 01:04:12,164
But sir...

1286
01:04:12,505 --> 01:04:15,083
Anu, I would stop this
murder at any cost. Okay?

1287
01:04:18,097 --> 01:04:18,650
Drive.

1288
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:20,770
-[siren wailing] Sir...
-What?

1289
01:04:20,962 --> 01:04:22,377
Please wait for 5 minutes, sir.
The ACP is on his way.

1290
01:04:22,439 --> 01:04:23,900
Why would I wait for an ACP?

1291
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,522
Sir, please try and
understand. Just five minutes.

1292
01:04:25,609 --> 01:04:27,126
-Tell him to come quickly.
-Yes, sir.

1293
01:04:29,055 --> 01:04:30,272
Okay. Common, fast!

1294
01:04:32,647 --> 01:04:33,399
Yes, Srikanth.

1295
01:04:33,499 --> 01:04:35,300
The minister is waiting, sir.

1296
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:37,392
Clear all the vehicles on that route.

1297
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:39,330
And stop all the vehicles
which are coming towards him.

1298
01:04:39,422 --> 01:04:39,970
Okay, sir.

1299
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:41,454
Drive fast, man.

1300
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:50,855
What is this delay,
when I am going on a personal work?

1301
01:04:52,939 --> 01:04:53,916
Sir...
[knocks]

1302
01:04:55,298 --> 01:04:56,299
WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your problem?

1303
01:04:56,699 --> 01:04:58,942
What do think I'm, a minister
or some SI who works under you?

1304
01:04:58,979 --> 01:04:59,897
There is a small problem, sir.

1305
01:05:00,148 --> 01:05:01,911
I will send you in five
minutes. Please wait.

1306
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:02,428
Hello.

1307
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:06,135
Divert all the vehicles travelling
in this direction to the other way.

1308
01:05:06,189 --> 01:05:07,780
-Don't let the traffic get stuck anywhere.
-Okay, sir.

1309
01:05:07,944 --> 01:05:10,772
Go! Go! Hey! Come!
Move! Come... Come.

1310
01:05:13,964 --> 01:05:16,130
Hey, come! Hello... Hello.

1311
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:19,140
Sir, a former minister is
adamant about going in this route.

1312
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:20,319
Move.

1313
01:05:22,097 --> 01:05:23,740
-Sir.
-What's this?

1314
01:05:24,172 --> 01:05:25,632
Even I am a minister, but former.

1315
01:05:26,147 --> 01:05:27,470
Sir, its not possible to
send you on this route.

1316
01:05:27,709 --> 01:05:29,373
I'll send you on another route.
Try to understand. Please.

1317
01:05:29,573 --> 01:05:31,605
-How can you say that?
-5 minutes, sir.

1318
01:05:32,772 --> 01:05:34,424
Reverse the vehicle.

1319
01:05:39,939 --> 01:05:42,337
There is no problem with the
transformer. Everything is clear.

1320
01:05:42,711 --> 01:05:44,599
-Okay, good. Send the minister.
-Okay, sir.

1321
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:45,799
[indistinctive voice on walkie-talkie]

1322
01:05:50,472 --> 01:05:50,927
What?

1323
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:55,901
[fire crackling]
[siren wailing]

1324
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:08,607
[vehicle arrives]

1325
01:06:11,827 --> 01:06:12,766
-[groans]
-Sir!

1326
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,745
You should be clear with the information
that you give. You said it would be VIP!

1327
01:06:15,837 --> 01:06:17,137
What did you tell me and
what the hell happened there?

1328
01:06:17,548 --> 01:06:19,344
The person who died was
an Ex-minister, sir.

1329
01:06:20,121 --> 01:06:21,939
Why? An Ex-minister cannot be a VIP?

1330
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:23,816
I gave you the correct information.

1331
01:06:23,908 --> 01:06:26,639
You ignored my words and
went off to another place.

1332
01:06:26,696 --> 01:06:27,472
Is that my fault?

1333
01:06:28,097 --> 01:06:30,581
You were not even considerate
of my gender and you slapped me.

1334
01:06:31,131 --> 01:06:32,104
Anu, that's...

1335
01:06:33,038 --> 01:06:35,707
From now on, mind your own
business and I'll do the same.

1336
01:06:36,021 --> 01:06:36,480
Dhana!

1337
01:06:37,064 --> 01:06:38,557
-[weeps]
-Anu... Anu...

1338
01:06:51,425 --> 01:06:52,241
[explosion]

1339
01:07:01,289 --> 01:07:02,906
Who killed these four VIP's?

1340
01:07:03,622 --> 01:07:05,116
Who are these four producers?

1341
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,717
Why did these four murderers
pretend to be producers?

1342
01:07:09,917 --> 01:07:11,234
[siren wailing]

1343
01:07:13,245 --> 01:07:14,752
Is anyone helping them?

1344
01:07:15,397 --> 01:07:18,025
Is Anu lying to me?
No!

1345
01:07:18,564 --> 01:07:19,502
There is no chance.

1346
01:07:20,484 --> 01:07:23,095
If Anu didn't speak, we wouldn't have
known about the murders in the first place

1347
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,523
What's the connection between
the producers and the VIPs?

1348
01:07:25,939 --> 01:07:30,383
Is there any connection between
the four producers and the VIPs?

[gunshot]

1350
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,619
I want all the details regarding those
four VIPs who died.

1351
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:00,095
I want their biodata, education details,

1352
01:08:00,379 --> 01:08:03,980
their posting areas and their
detailed post-mortem report.

1353
01:08:07,622 --> 01:08:09,160
Sir, the details you asked for.

1354
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,871

1361
01:09:13,085 --> 01:09:15,189
So, these four worked in
Srikakulam constituency.

1362
01:09:15,805 --> 01:09:16,714
My guess is right.

1363
01:09:17,242 --> 01:09:19,855
The answer to the story that began
here will be found only there.

Please come here.

-Sir, he is constable Subba reddy.
-Greetings, sir.

1369
01:09:36,597 --> 01:09:38,022
Sir, this person worked as a driver

1370
01:09:38,078 --> 01:09:42,166
with the deceased DSP when he
worked as an SP in this district.

1371
01:09:42,366 --> 01:09:45,101
I summoned him here so that he can give
you the information that you need.

Sir, I...

1373

Oh! Thank you, sir.

sir. It's my duty, sir.

1375
01:09:52,215 --> 01:09:54,280
Mr Subba Reddy, attend him
if he needs any further help.

Okay, sir.

-Mr Subba Reddy,
-Yes, sir.

1378
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:05,322
-You've worked as the SP's driver, right?
-Yes, sir.

1379
01:10:05,522 --> 01:10:06,879
Can you tell me anything about him?

-Yes, sir.

01:10:36,997 --> 01:10:38,425
Can you identify these two persons?

Sir, give me a moment.

Sir...

1387
01:11:16,918 --> 01:11:19,203
Not just these two persons, there were
another two people along with them.

1388
01:11:19,939 --> 01:11:22,758
25 years ago,
they suddenly went missing.

1389
01:11:23,098 --> 01:11:24,560
There is a missing
case on them as well.

1390
01:11:25,455 --> 01:11:26,710
Is that case on these
people not closed yet?

1391
01:11:27,303 --> 01:11:28,326
Their whereabouts weren't traced.

1392
01:11:29,014 --> 01:11:30,675
Didn't anyone come here asking about them?

1393
01:11:30,735 --> 01:11:32,216
Initially, their family members
enquired about them, sir.

1394
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:36,071
It's been so many years since,
so they didn't pursue it anymore.

1395
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:37,992
But, a women came here everyday

1396
01:11:38,592 --> 01:11:40,752
and enquired about
them until two years ago, sir.

1397
01:11:41,132 --> 01:11:42,597
-Do you have her address?
-Yes, sir. I do.

1398
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:43,794

Who are you, sir?

Ma'am, can I talk to you about something?

1403
01:12:11,272 --> 01:12:14,697
He is my husband.
25 years have passed.

1404
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:18,864
He went to the city, along with three
of his friends. He didn't return yet.

1405
01:12:19,447 --> 01:12:20,895
We don't even know what happened to him.

Whenever a new SI gets transferred
to the police station of this village,

1407
01:12:23,889 --> 01:12:25,621
I kept going to the police station
and enquired about my husband.

1408
01:12:26,922 --> 01:12:31,072
There is only a faint hope that he
would come back before I die of old age.

1409
01:12:31,281 --> 01:12:32,989
Do you know why and where he went?

1410
01:12:33,656 --> 01:12:34,786
I don't know, sir.

1411
01:12:35,878 --> 01:12:38,740
But I do know the
person he went looking for.

1412
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,461
For whom?

1413
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:42,812

Who is this lady?

1416

She is our mother Aravinda.

1417
01:13:17,324 --> 01:13:20,859
She is the mother to

We've come here to report to the
collector about the injustice done by you,

1421
01:13:43,942 --> 01:13:45,081
how can you obstruct us?

1422
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:45,864
Move out of the way.

01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:49,016
Let us tell our problems to the
Collector. Get out of the way.

1424

The collector is in an important meeting.

1425
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:52,007
It's not possible to meet him.

1426
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:54,502
Please leave the premises immediately.

Why did we come here, dad?

1431

The police have arrested
your grandfather, Ramayya.

1432
01:14:25,656 --> 01:14:26,928
You mother has come
here to get him released.

01:14:27,156 --> 01:14:28,272
How does mother know?

1434
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,236
When you get hurt, what do you say?

1435
01:14:30,336 --> 01:14:31,887
I call out 'mother' loudly.

1436
01:14:32,114 --> 01:14:32,781
And then what happens?

1437
01:14:33,031 --> 01:14:35,864
Then, mother would come and does
her magic. Voila! I get healed.

1438
01:14:36,031 --> 01:14:38,822
When then get hurt, they call
out for mother and she arrives.

but she is a mother to everyone.

Unless I come her by
travelling for 400 kilometers,

01:14:49,959 --> 01:14:53,003
couldn't you take four steps to
get to the public, Mr Collector?

01:14:53,203 --> 01:14:55,571
When all the people from the surrounding
villages come here and create trouble...

1444
01:14:55,695 --> 01:14:57,430
Ah! Correct yourself!

1445
01:14:57,730 --> 01:14:59,499
These surrounding villages are
not just villages, but my home.

1446
01:15:00,851 --> 01:15:02,794
These 2000 door steps are
the thresholds of my house.

1447
01:15:03,091 --> 01:15:04,252
These people belong to my family.

1448
01:15:05,447 --> 01:15:07,672
They've committed a crime and
hence, they were arrested.

1449
01:15:07,872 --> 01:15:09,290
I know about my people very well.

1450
01:15:09,835 --> 01:15:12,194
They only know toil and
labour but not greed and envy.

1451
01:15:12,585 --> 01:15:13,939
Release them immediately.

1452
01:15:14,072 --> 01:15:15,541
It's a law and order problem, madam.

1453
01:15:15,747 --> 01:15:17,907
It would be wise only if the
police make that decision.

1454
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:19,971
As a District First class Magistrate,

1455
01:15:20,193 --> 01:15:22,701
you can use your judicial power
and solve the problem, can't you?

1456
01:15:22,953 --> 01:15:25,692
I have already called the
district SP. He is on the way.

Madam, why did you come here all the way?

1461
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,884
-A phone call would have sufficed.
-I can't work over a phone call...

1462
01:15:38,156 --> 01:15:40,415
...because it's not a duty unlike
yours, but devotion on them.

1463
01:15:41,197 --> 01:15:43,601
Let's come to the point.
Why did you arrest them?

1464
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:45,781
The thing is that... the
MLA has ordered us to do so.

1465
01:15:45,837 --> 01:15:47,806
Is it the MLA's order? Where is he?

1466
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:51,431
Madam! Madam! Madam! I am here.

1467
01:15:51,531 --> 01:15:52,518
You don't have to be that
deferential towards me.

1468
01:15:52,718 --> 01:15:54,373
The elections are still three years away.

1469
01:15:54,973 --> 01:15:56,837
These people voted for you
because I told them to do so.

1470
01:15:57,037 --> 01:16:00,039
Didn't you think of telling me
before doing anything with them?

1471
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:01,619
You are right, madam... You are right!

1472
01:16:01,822 --> 01:16:04,650
You promised them that you would treat
them right and fair when elected to power.

1473
01:16:04,874 --> 01:16:06,471
But why are you harassing them?

1474
01:16:07,322 --> 01:16:09,357
That's because...
The thing is that...

1475
01:16:09,557 --> 01:16:12,405
Did you think that I was out of their
reach as I'm staying little far from them?

1476
01:16:12,925 --> 01:16:15,629
Withdraw the police cases against
them and release them immediately.

1477
01:16:15,829 --> 01:16:18,355
Madam, I will release them and send
them home after a few formalities.

1478
01:16:18,431 --> 01:16:19,041
Please head home, madam.

1479
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:20,484
I won't leave until they are released.

01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:25,572
Madam.... Madam.... Madam...
Why are you sitting on the floor?

1481
01:16:25,772 --> 01:16:27,164
Hey, get a chair. Get it.

1482
01:16:27,347 --> 01:16:28,164
Madam...
Please sit on the chair.

1483
01:16:28,364 --> 01:16:30,722
Respect for a person is not something
that is given in their presence.

1484
01:16:30,876 --> 01:16:32,976
It's the value and worth you give
to their word in their absence.

1485
01:16:34,322 --> 01:16:38,237

to support and help the people. Go on.

us if we'd stayed there for one more day.

We didn't even know if
this news had reached you.

have died in that darkness.

about all of it. Is that alright?

01:18:23,262 --> 01:18:23,951
Hmph!

1514
01:18:24,614 --> 01:18:28,864
Dad, I think mom is still angry.
Why don't we find another mother?

1515
01:18:29,572 --> 01:18:30,306
Get lost.

1516
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:31,146
You get lost.

1517
01:18:31,338 --> 01:18:33,659
Why should I get lost?
You get lost. This is my husband.

1518
01:18:33,859 --> 01:18:35,048
-This is my father.
-My husband.

1519
01:18:35,224 --> 01:18:36,875
-My father...
-My husband...

1520
01:18:37,075 --> 01:18:37,740
My father...

1521
01:18:37,783 --> 01:18:38,387
You go away.

1522
01:18:38,555 --> 01:18:40,072
-You go away. It's my husband.
-Hey... Aravinda... my coffee.

1523
01:18:40,767 --> 01:18:42,739
-Greetings sir... Greetings, ma'am.
-Greetings, Uncle.

1524
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:43,807
Come in.

1525
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:48,581
-How are you, Uncle?
-We are good.

1526
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:49,376
Where is Sita?

1527
01:18:52,036 --> 01:18:52,871
Hmm...

1528
01:18:53,114 --> 01:18:56,246
I came here yesterday but
she didn't come to see me.

1529
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:59,722
I think she finds her
in-law's place more comfortable.

1530
01:19:02,189 --> 01:19:06,591
Does she remember her parents'
place at least? Does she even visit you?

1531
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:07,791
[weeps]

1532
01:19:13,322 --> 01:19:14,614
Sita will not come.

1533
01:19:14,814 --> 01:19:15,999
Not only Sita,

1534
01:19:16,663 --> 01:19:19,550
her husband, the shop owner Setty,

1535
01:19:19,806 --> 01:19:25,503
the laundryman Ravulu, the priest in
the temple etc, no one of them will come.

1536
01:19:25,622 --> 01:19:26,747
None of them can come.

1537
01:19:28,506 --> 01:19:31,122
All of them left us.

1538
01:19:31,906 --> 01:19:35,428
There is a steady decrease in the
number of young people in the village.

1539
01:19:36,001 --> 01:19:38,981
There is only an increase of
people who are likely to die.

1540
01:19:39,181 --> 01:19:40,181
[weeping]

1541
01:19:42,189 --> 01:19:42,881
What happened, Uncle?

1542
01:19:43,081 --> 01:19:44,082
Come this way, madam.

1543
01:19:45,065 --> 01:19:48,065
Look at this horror with your own eyes.

1544
01:19:48,745 --> 01:19:52,873
Oh dear Lord! Oh dear Lord!

1545
01:19:56,418 --> 01:19:58,087
It is a terrible thing.

1546
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:05,084
What is this? There is not
even a bit of humanity left.

1547
01:20:05,688 --> 01:20:07,420
They are not even treated as humans.

1548
01:20:07,906 --> 01:20:08,762
Sorry, madam.

1549
01:20:08,962 --> 01:20:11,597
There are only herds of people
who are admitted in the hospital.

1550
01:20:11,997 --> 01:20:13,495
But there is no one who has
been cured and discharged

1551
01:20:13,847 --> 01:20:15,055
unless dead.

1552
01:20:15,555 --> 01:20:18,614
There is only one hospital.
It's a very big problem.

1553
01:20:20,053 --> 01:20:21,081
What's the problem?

1554
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:24,643
CKD which means Chronic Kidney Disease.

1555
01:20:24,864 --> 01:20:27,306
How can this affect many
people at the same time?

1556
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:28,616
That is what we're unable
to figure it out, madam.

1557
01:20:28,864 --> 01:20:31,431
Generally, people with high Blood Pressure
and Sugar are prone to this disease.

1558
01:20:32,031 --> 01:20:33,932
But all the patients who
have been admitted here

1559
01:20:34,172 --> 01:20:35,643
have normal levels of
Blood Pressure and Sugar.

1560
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:39,315
The creatine levels are
supposed to be at 1.2%

1561
01:20:39,883 --> 01:20:41,667
but for the patients admitted
here, it is around 15% to 18.1%

1562
01:20:43,447 --> 01:20:44,814
Isn't there a solution to this?

1563
01:20:44,914 --> 01:20:47,264
There is one. Vacate the village.

1564
01:20:47,436 --> 01:20:48,183
-Ah
-Oh no!

1565
01:20:49,322 --> 01:20:50,875
It is not easy as you say.

1566
01:20:51,275 --> 01:20:53,523
These are the farmers who celebrate
'Yeruvaka' festival once in a year

1567
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,167
and pray to the soil for
good crop in the village.

1568
01:20:56,906 --> 01:20:58,731
People like you wouldn't understand it.

1569
01:20:59,281 --> 01:20:59,979
Sorry, madam.

1570
01:21:00,411 --> 01:21:01,878
I couldn't find another solution
and that is why I suggested that.

1571
01:21:02,258 --> 01:21:03,499
What were the efforts
you've put into this?

1572
01:21:05,256 --> 01:21:07,078
We will meet tomorrow in the
District Collector's office.

1573
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:09,664
Let's see why we can't find a
solution to this problem. Come, Uncle.

1574
01:21:16,781 --> 01:21:18,775
It's been over 50 years since
our country got its independence

1575
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:21,384
but the village continues
to have no drinking water.

1576
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:24,156
Instead, we have these empty slogans that
villages are the lifelines of this country

1577
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:26,281
[scoffs] Is this what you call progress?

1578
01:21:26,489 --> 01:21:28,864
Madam, we are not
twiddling our thumbs here.

1579
01:21:29,064 --> 01:21:33,197
We instituted a committee to study the
issue. They have given us two solutions.

1580
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,439
The research process is on.

1581
01:21:35,951 --> 01:21:39,110
We found the problem to
be Chronic Kidney Disease.

1582
01:21:39,906 --> 01:21:41,272
The reason for this is because

1583
01:21:41,444 --> 01:21:44,984
the water here has more than the
permissible amount of chemicals.

1584
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:48,614
That's the reason why we advised
the people to drink purified water.

1585
01:21:48,714 --> 01:21:52,687
It's expensive to purify water
and supply it to all the villages.

1586
01:21:54,672 --> 01:21:58,247
That is the reason why we were
in favour of the second option.

1587
01:21:59,672 --> 01:22:02,093
We've planned to rehabilitate
people from the...

1588
01:22:02,365 --> 01:22:05,773
...7 Mandals of this
district to another mandals.

1589
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:08,010
However, the people prefer to die here

1590
01:22:08,314 --> 01:22:10,042
rather than rehabilitate
themselves elsewhere.

1591
01:22:10,222 --> 01:22:13,238
These people aren't immigrants who'd pack
up and leave the village on a command.

1592
01:22:13,457 --> 01:22:14,708
They are farmers.

1593
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,684
A village isn't about 100 or 200 houses.

1594
01:22:18,544 --> 01:22:20,708
It is a bond with the soil that
was established since generations.

1595
01:22:22,364 --> 01:22:23,081
No matter if they eat food or not,

1596
01:22:23,464 --> 01:22:25,482
they can sleep peacefully
under a tree or on floor.

1597
01:22:26,214 --> 01:22:28,010
But when one person is facing trouble,

1598
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:29,559
there are ten people
to support or help them.

1599
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:31,356
That's the confidence a village gives you.

1600
01:22:32,672 --> 01:22:36,281
What you say is correct, but we lack
funds. There is nothing to be done here.

1601
01:22:36,464 --> 01:22:38,056
Don't we have people's
representative here?

1602
01:22:38,097 --> 01:22:41,289
I am only a People's Representative in
name but I sit on the opposition bench.

1603
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:42,567
Do you think the government listens to me?

1604
01:22:42,767 --> 01:22:43,834
Even if I try to make them listen to me,

1605
01:22:44,154 --> 01:22:45,951
I should at least get 5 minutes
of time to speak in the parliament

1606
01:22:46,271 --> 01:22:48,015
amongst the 549 members of
the elected representatives.

1607
01:22:48,489 --> 01:22:51,166
Even if I was lucky to get the mic
to raise the issue in the Parliament...

1608
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:52,786
Before I clear my throat to speak,

1609
01:22:53,057 --> 01:22:55,482
there'd be someone from the other
corner, who'd disrupt the parliament

1610
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:56,726
with sloganeering and protests.

1611
01:22:57,114 --> 01:22:59,572
And then the session would be
adjourned. What do you want me to do?

1612
01:23:01,239 --> 01:23:02,410
Resign.

1613
01:23:03,406 --> 01:23:04,947
Resign?

1614
01:23:05,239 --> 01:23:07,226
Yes. Resign from your post.

1615
01:23:08,091 --> 01:23:09,018
There would be a by-elections.

1616
01:23:09,463 --> 01:23:11,978
Use this issue as a platform
and contest the elections.

1617
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,041
The members of the opposition
will use the same platform

1618
01:23:15,633 --> 01:23:17,437
and that is when the Centre's
eye will be focussed here.

1619
01:23:17,489 --> 01:23:18,792
It isn't that easy, ma'am.

1620
01:23:19,856 --> 01:23:20,778
Let's see why this can't be done.

1621
01:23:25,939 --> 01:23:27,187
First, you resign.

1622
01:23:28,743 --> 01:23:30,213
-And you as well.
-Madam....

1623
01:23:40,522 --> 01:23:41,781
-What are you doing here?
-Hmm...

1624
01:23:46,197 --> 01:23:49,239
All these resignations, protests
against the government, these elections...

1625
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:51,872
it would take years for this process
to complete and work on the solution.

1626
01:23:52,589 --> 01:23:54,304
Numerous lives would
be lost by then, Raghu.

1627
01:23:54,504 --> 01:23:55,541
I cannot allow that to happen.

1628
01:23:56,267 --> 01:23:57,819
Do you think worrying solves anything?

1629
01:23:57,919 --> 01:23:59,109
You have to think of solutions.

1630
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:01,589
Why don't we sleep a little and
then think fresh in the morning?

1631
01:24:02,468 --> 01:24:03,672
It's midnight. Let's go.

1632
01:24:04,389 --> 01:24:06,854
The midnight gave our
country its independence.

1633
01:24:07,377 --> 01:24:09,350
Don't you think we can find
a small solution at midnight?

1634
01:24:11,822 --> 01:24:14,520
From tomorrow, no one from the village
should drink the water of this village.

1635
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:16,739
Alright. That is what we will do.

1636
01:24:17,281 --> 01:24:18,091
We will get the tankers from outside,

1637
01:24:18,147 --> 01:24:20,187
buy water and supply it to
every one in these villages.

1638
01:24:20,697 --> 01:24:22,581
If necessary, let's also
establish temporary medical camps.

1639
01:24:23,264 --> 01:24:23,713
Hmm...

1640
01:24:24,322 --> 01:24:26,669
Let's get the best
nephrologist from the city.

1641
01:24:27,389 --> 01:24:29,565
Let's establish a lab and
fund the research ourselves.

1642
01:24:30,531 --> 01:24:33,414
Let's spend our entire
fortune on this, Raghu.

1643
01:24:33,756 --> 01:24:37,460
By then, either the government or
an NGO will respond to this issue.

1644
01:24:41,472 --> 01:24:47,432
[music]

1645
01:24:47,772 --> 01:24:53,489
"You are the sunrise
amidst the dark mountains"

1646
01:24:54,031 --> 01:24:59,656
"You are the lightning in
the hearts of the people"

1647
01:25:37,531 --> 01:25:43,514
"We were desolate,
without any help and without support"

1648
01:25:43,714 --> 01:25:49,422
"You filled up these
shrivelled hearts with hope"

1649
01:25:49,631 --> 01:25:55,598
"Just as an eyelash protects
the eye, you have protected us?

1650
01:25:56,031 --> 01:26:01,939
?We bask as little children
in your benevolent gaze"

1651
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:11,072
"Oh, mother Aravinda..."

1652
01:26:11,447 --> 01:26:14,389
"We must have been indebted
to you in our previous lives"

1653
01:26:14,489 --> 01:26:17,277
"Oh, mother Aravinda..."

1654
01:26:17,644 --> 01:26:20,525
"You have given us another lease of life"

1655
01:26:32,322 --> 01:26:35,364
It looks like she wouldn't let neither
the disease nor us stay here.

1656
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:39,913
Does a meagre win call for a celebration?

1657
01:26:40,777 --> 01:26:45,345
I know how to hamper
her progress. Drive on.

1658
01:26:55,739 --> 01:26:57,947
Instead of cooking up some story and
feeding it to the people who came here,

1659
01:26:58,047 --> 01:26:59,739
you've unnecessarily
imprisoned them.

1660
01:26:59,919 --> 01:27:01,531
You have blown up the issue.

1661
01:27:01,697 --> 01:27:03,190
Well... I am an uneducated hooligan.

1662
01:27:03,622 --> 01:27:04,758
But he is an IPS officer, right?

1663
01:27:04,896 --> 01:27:06,517
When I told you to imprison them, why did
you do that without any second thought?

1664
01:27:06,785 --> 01:27:07,720
Shouldn't you have used your judged?

1665
01:27:08,173 --> 01:27:11,153
Oh! You are blaming me?

1666
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:13,135
If that's the case,
I'd have made all of you...

1667
01:27:13,335 --> 01:27:13,912
Hey, stop it man!

1668
01:27:15,336 --> 01:27:18,972
Think of the future actions that has to be
done. Stop smearing each other with dirt.

1669
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:20,858
It's upto you that you
have been into this mess.

1670
01:27:21,114 --> 01:27:22,110
But you've dragged me into this.

1671
01:27:22,756 --> 01:27:26,298
I used all of my MP funds
for these villagers.

1672
01:27:26,354 --> 01:27:27,882
They turned out to be disloyal!

1673
01:27:28,282 --> 01:27:29,718
Anyway, it's pointless blaming them.

1674
01:27:30,193 --> 01:27:33,127
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have trusted you.

1675
01:27:33,405 --> 01:27:34,316
Let it go, sir.

1676
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:35,336
What should I let go?

1677
01:27:35,536 --> 01:27:39,164
Come on, sir... Why are you so irked?

1678
01:27:39,364 --> 01:27:43,081
You might find my attitude irksome
but I am the one who is being burnt.

1679
01:27:43,281 --> 01:27:44,364
What needs to be done?

1680
01:27:44,464 --> 01:27:46,764
Do whatever you want.
We will carve our own path.

1681
01:27:47,484 --> 01:27:50,614
I know exactly what needs to be
done to get out of this mess.

1682
01:27:50,652 --> 01:27:53,989
-Hell with their rotten plans.
-Sir, please wait... MP sir...

1683
01:27:54,218 --> 01:27:55,467
Stop him. He's leaving.

1684
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:58,308
It's not him who should be stopped but the
thing that is going to happen tomorrow.

1685
01:27:58,423 --> 01:28:01,388
How, sir? We pilfered a lot of the
funds allocated to this issue.

1686
01:28:03,614 --> 01:28:07,275
If my superiors get the information of
her philanthropic work through media,

1687
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,550
all the accounts would be out.

1688
01:28:08,807 --> 01:28:12,239
And it won't be long when
the CM hears about it!

1689
01:28:12,281 --> 01:28:12,834
It's true.

1690
01:28:13,074 --> 01:28:16,161
The Intelligence Agency must have briefed
the Chief Minister on this issue by now.

1691
01:28:16,614 --> 01:28:18,397
Isn't there anything that could be done?

1692
01:28:19,767 --> 01:28:20,823
Of course, there is a way.

1693
01:28:22,198 --> 01:28:25,310
If diplomacy fails,

1694
01:28:27,606 --> 01:28:28,798
it's time for war.

1695
01:28:39,281 --> 01:28:40,556
So, what do you have to say finally?

1696
01:28:40,922 --> 01:28:43,947
Our wealth is given to us,
to be enjoyed by us.

1697
01:28:44,147 --> 01:28:47,187
It's not wise to be hasty and sell off
the property for the welfare of others.

1698
01:28:48,647 --> 01:28:50,072
She is not being hasty, Collector sir.

1699
01:28:50,427 --> 01:28:52,834
She wants to do good to her
people as early as possible.

1700
01:28:53,134 --> 01:28:55,156
The government exists
to look after the people.

1701
01:28:56,346 --> 01:28:58,352
Just because it's cloudy,
it doesn't guarantee a harvest.

1702
01:28:58,552 --> 01:28:59,697
It should rain.

1703
01:29:00,114 --> 01:29:01,906
Just because there is a
government, it doesn't guarantee progress.

1704
01:29:02,106 --> 01:29:04,697
So you want to personally
take up that responsibility?

1705
01:29:04,822 --> 01:29:05,681
Certainly!

1706
01:29:06,947 --> 01:29:08,818
You are disregarding the system and

1707
01:29:08,941 --> 01:29:12,361
constitutionally elected government and
taking charge personally. Is it correct?

1708
01:29:12,753 --> 01:29:15,495
When the decision makers are sleeping,
someone should be attentive, sir.

1709
01:29:16,914 --> 01:29:19,331
I have said all that needs to
be said. It's your choice now.

1710
01:29:20,315 --> 01:29:22,020
Are you scared or are
you threatening me?

1711
01:29:23,085 --> 01:29:23,917
[sighs]

1712
01:29:24,522 --> 01:29:26,947
Aravinda only thinks about
things that need to be done.

1713
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:29,118
She is unaware of how much money you
pilfered through the sanctioned funds.

1714
01:29:29,318 --> 01:29:31,572
But I know what tricks
you have been up to.

1715
01:29:33,864 --> 01:29:35,632
I'm telling you now because the
issue has come up till here.

1716
01:29:35,992 --> 01:29:38,127
Try to understand.
Don't obstruct us.

1717
01:29:43,202 --> 01:29:45,910
I want Dad... I want Dad...

1718
01:29:45,994 --> 01:29:48,020
-Dad will come. But eat now.
-No, I won't eat.

1719
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:49,519
I will eat only when Dad comes home.

1720
01:29:50,369 --> 01:29:52,977
You have become
stubborn! Wait. Let's call dad.

1721
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:58,871
[dials]

1722
01:30:01,377 --> 01:30:02,291
Yes, What's up Aravinda?

1723
01:30:03,244 --> 01:30:06,160
Talk to your darling daughter. Apparently,
she wouldn't eat until you come.

1724
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,119
Dad, are you coming?

1725
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,327
Dad has some work, baby. Eat up. I'll come

1726
01:30:11,352 --> 01:30:13,119
Okay.
Since you've told me, I'll eat.

1727
01:30:13,244 --> 01:30:13,886
Oh really?

1728
01:30:15,214 --> 01:30:18,159
Raghu, the fianceres
from Hyderabad called.

1729
01:30:18,819 --> 01:30:21,044
They said that the agreements
are ready. Maybe you have to go.

1730
01:30:21,244 --> 01:30:22,827
-Alright. I'll be there.
-Okay.

1731
01:30:23,027 --> 01:30:28,937
[aerplane whizzing]
[tyres screech]

1732
01:30:29,744 --> 01:30:34,160
She needed money to complete the
works he began in the village.

1733
01:30:34,535 --> 01:30:38,952
For that, they've decided to sell all
the assets that they had in the city.

1734
01:30:39,369 --> 01:30:41,327
So, the entire family embarked
on a journey to the city.

1735
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:44,774
To help the lady and for the
welfare of the entire village,

1736
01:30:46,534 --> 01:30:48,934
my husband and his
friends went along with her.

1737
01:30:49,702 --> 01:30:54,702
25 years have passed.
I don't even know what happened.

1738
01:30:56,577 --> 01:30:59,327
No one... No one came back.

1739
01:31:03,269 --> 01:31:05,796
But I do know one thing.

1740
01:31:06,956 --> 01:31:07,524
What is it?

1741
01:31:09,036 --> 01:31:13,796
Amongst the entire family,
only one person survived.

1742
01:31:32,541 --> 01:31:33,027
Hey...

1743
01:31:34,008 --> 01:31:34,788
[groans]

1744
01:31:37,967 --> 01:31:38,479
Hey...

1745
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:50,574
[groans]

1746
01:31:51,608 --> 01:31:52,264
[groans]

1747
01:31:53,827 --> 01:31:54,533
[groans]

1748
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:01,790
Aw!

1749
01:32:13,645 --> 01:32:15,197
[sprays]

1750
01:32:15,551 --> 01:32:16,057
Sir...

1751
01:32:20,684 --> 01:32:21,296
[groans]

1752
01:32:22,512 --> 01:32:23,504
Stay here...

1753
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:26,600
Dhana...

1754
01:32:30,113 --> 01:32:30,555
Come...

1755
01:32:31,113 --> 01:32:31,786
Hey...

1756
01:32:34,752 --> 01:32:35,779
-I will jump, sir...
-Hey...

1757
01:32:35,994 --> 01:32:37,369
Hey, let's go.

1758
01:32:38,688 --> 01:32:43,401
[sighs]

1759
01:32:49,352 --> 01:32:50,085
Are you okay?

1760
01:32:52,835 --> 01:32:55,659
-Thank god you were on time or else...
-Hey...

1761
01:32:55,869 --> 01:32:57,488
Okay.. I am always there for you guys.
... Anu.

1762
01:32:58,789 --> 01:33:01,496
-Anyways, take care of her.
-Hmm...

1763
01:33:03,158 --> 01:33:04,110
My God!

1764
01:33:08,227 --> 01:33:08,785
Anu.

1765
01:33:14,519 --> 01:33:17,077
Anu, can you do me a small favour?

1766
01:33:18,827 --> 01:33:23,110
I have a story but
there is only one half of it.

1767
01:33:23,369 --> 01:33:28,910
I am not able to think up the
second half. Can you tell me?

1768
01:33:30,388 --> 01:33:31,744
I am not in the mood to
listen to any story.

1769
01:33:32,119 --> 01:33:33,744
But I have to tell it.

1770
01:33:44,101 --> 01:33:46,386
What happened to the family who
embarked on a journey to Hyderabad?

1771
01:33:46,922 --> 01:33:49,378
What happened to the four old men
of that village who disappeared?

1772
01:33:49,778 --> 01:33:52,944
Specifically, what was that
five-year old girl doing?

1773
01:33:53,563 --> 01:33:54,804
Can you tell me?

1774
01:33:55,402 --> 01:34:00,019
Miss Anu, daughter of Late
'Srimati Pasupuleti Aravinda'

1775
01:34:00,219 --> 01:34:01,219
[breathes]

1776
01:34:04,619 --> 01:34:06,202
So, you figured everything out.

1777
01:34:06,327 --> 01:34:08,577
Only if you tell me the rest of the
story, I will know the entire story.

1778
01:34:09,137 --> 01:34:09,752
[scoffs]

1779
01:34:16,702 --> 01:34:18,244
Please sign here.

1780
01:34:19,327 --> 01:34:21,685
Sethji, please ensure that
I get the amount soon.

1781
01:34:21,761 --> 01:34:22,593
Sure, ma'am.

1782
01:34:23,751 --> 01:34:26,535
[door shatters]
Ma'am... Ma'am...

1783
01:34:28,456 --> 01:34:28,924
Hey...

1784
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:35,150
Raghu!

1785
01:34:53,535 --> 01:34:56,660
Hey... Hey...
Hey... Leave him.

1786
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:57,996
Sir, you carry on.

1787
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,869
Hmmm, can we talk now?

1788
01:35:02,597 --> 01:35:03,027
Hey...

1789
01:35:04,619 --> 01:35:06,706
What's this, like a small little girl?

1790
01:35:07,078 --> 01:35:09,826
Would anyone bring the problems
on the road to their homes?

1791
01:35:10,026 --> 01:35:11,540
There will always be problems.

1792
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:17,471
But to sell your ancestral property
for the welfare of a stranger,

1793
01:35:17,571 --> 01:35:18,399
is that wise?

1794
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:24,400
If you do that, what will you get? Just
a statue at the centre of the village.

1795
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:27,137
Or perhaps, your death anniversary
would be celebrated every year.

1796
01:35:27,577 --> 01:35:28,577
Are you done?

1797
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:32,094
How can you send the elders who
came to your place with empty hands?

1798
01:35:32,785 --> 01:35:33,535
What do you want?

1799
01:35:33,952 --> 01:35:34,517
Your word.

1800
01:35:35,117 --> 01:35:37,341
I want your word that you would
no longer interfere with this issue.

1801
01:35:37,373 --> 01:35:38,451
-We will leave then
-If not?

1802
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:40,196
-If not? You...
-[smirks] [claps]

1803
01:35:40,396 --> 01:35:45,202
Talked like a man. What will we do?
We'll murder you inside these four walls.

1804
01:35:45,619 --> 01:35:49,077
-Are you threatening me?
-No. No. We are giving you an opportunity.

1805
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:51,955
It doesn't look like you are digging
the village for water.

1806
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:53,272
It seems you are digging beneath us.

1807
01:35:53,372 --> 01:35:55,460
Never mind, we don't have a lot of time.

1808
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:57,564
If you give us your nod,

1809
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,028
we'd have a nice cup
of tea made by you and

1810
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:00,963
will head to the village
in the evening train. That's it.

1811
01:36:01,063 --> 01:36:01,573
If not?

1812
01:36:01,773 --> 01:36:04,413
I feel irritated to repeat the same thing.

1813
01:36:04,513 --> 01:36:05,261
I am saying the same thing as well.

1814
01:36:05,290 --> 01:36:07,303
We will neither repeat telling
this nor change our decision.

1815
01:36:07,478 --> 01:36:08,623
You are repeating it again!

1816
01:36:09,323 --> 01:36:12,354
Doesn't God, who treats eveyone equally,
knows about their problems?

1817
01:36:12,554 --> 01:36:16,052
If God himself has destined the lives of
these people, why are you interfering?

1818
01:36:16,244 --> 01:36:19,894
Are you angry that we have undertaken
the job that you guys are supposed to do?

1819
01:36:19,994 --> 01:36:25,244
The issue is that, the government will not
stay silent when the people are unhappy.

1820
01:36:25,327 --> 01:36:26,160
It's the same case here.

1821
01:36:26,848 --> 01:36:29,488
In order to solve the problem, the
government sanctioned a hell lot of money.

1822
01:36:29,688 --> 01:36:34,127
If one sees such huge amounts of money,
would anyone stay silent? Let's split it.

1823
01:36:34,404 --> 01:36:34,957
[scoffs]

1824
01:36:35,157 --> 01:36:38,369
The diplomacy has failed anyway.
So, now the option is war.

1825
01:36:38,494 --> 01:36:39,507
Why are you wasting my time?

1826
01:36:39,683 --> 01:36:40,453
[gunshot] [groans]

1827
01:36:40,776 --> 01:36:41,715
Sir... Sir...

1828
01:36:43,002 --> 01:36:43,995
[gunshot]
Sir...

1829
01:36:44,195 --> 01:36:45,487
Ma'am...

1830
01:36:46,361 --> 01:36:47,919
Happy Diwali!

1831
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:48,844
Kanniah...

1832
01:36:49,468 --> 01:36:50,696
-Brother... brother...
-No, madam...

1833
01:36:50,701 --> 01:36:53,560
Please don't give your
life sake of us lives.

1834
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:56,619
Why are you still adamant when they
themselves are accepting the proposal?

1835
01:36:57,369 --> 01:37:01,202
You will kill me if I sign the papers.
Even if I don't, you'll kill me anyway.

1836
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:04,638
I don't care what happens to me
but my mission should stay alive.

1837
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:07,160
Correct! But there is no fun in this game.

1838
01:37:12,108 --> 01:37:13,631
[weeps]

1839
01:37:13,831 --> 01:37:15,006
Ma'am... Ma'am...

1840
01:37:15,327 --> 01:37:17,785
Please don't do that, sir...
Please don't do that, sir...

1841
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:19,948
Mom... Mom...

1842
01:37:20,048 --> 01:37:21,851
-Please don't do that, sir...
-Daddy... Daddy...

1843
01:37:23,608 --> 01:37:24,492
[slits]
Sir!

1844
01:37:24,935 --> 01:37:26,388
-Hey...
-They've killed our ma'am.

1845
01:37:27,049 --> 01:37:28,789
-Mom... Mom...
-Move quickly... Quick...

1846
01:37:29,297 --> 01:37:30,557
They've killed them...

1847
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:34,198
Please don't harm us...

1848
01:37:34,244 --> 01:37:36,920
Hey, get the petrol can.

1849
01:37:37,327 --> 01:37:40,315
Daddy... Daddy...
Mom... Mom...

1850
01:37:42,944 --> 01:37:43,664
Mom...

1851
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:46,577
-More items...
-Mom...

1852
01:37:48,785 --> 01:37:52,419
Mother! Mother!
Father! Father!

1853
01:37:52,619 --> 01:37:55,139
Hey... We have to save the baby girl.

1854
01:37:55,452 --> 01:37:56,513
We have to save the baby girl.

1855
01:38:00,789 --> 01:38:01,214
[gunshot]

1856
01:38:02,806 --> 01:38:04,290
Daddy... Daddy...

1857
01:38:04,484 --> 01:38:06,115
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1858
01:38:12,952 --> 01:38:17,134
It is alright if burn to death in this
fire. But we have to save the baby girl.

1859
01:38:17,202 --> 01:38:21,410
No, grandpa. I will stay. I will stay.

1860
01:38:21,732 --> 01:38:25,567
-Baby girl, be careful. Be careful.
-Mom... Mom...

1861
01:38:25,839 --> 01:38:28,815
-Mom... Mom...-[sobbing]

1862
01:38:29,324 --> 01:38:34,250
[screams]
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1863
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:36,139
[screams]

1864
01:38:42,702 --> 01:38:46,202
-All those murders?
- I did all that.

1865
01:38:46,785 --> 01:38:50,619
What a full proof plan! One could
only know it if you confessed it.

1866
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:51,794
You've committed three murders,

1867
01:38:51,994 --> 01:38:55,994
came to me with a blinding story and tried
to use me in the fourth murder, right?

1868
01:38:57,535 --> 01:38:58,565
What can I do?

1869
01:38:59,009 --> 01:39:00,706
I have to murder a VIP, right?

1870
01:39:01,299 --> 01:39:04,290
Security and protocol
looked very intimidating.

1871
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,130
So why didn't you tell
me about the climax?

1872
01:39:06,785 --> 01:39:07,909
I didn't think it was necessary.

1873
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:10,537
Is that it or don't you know about the
fifth person that you have to kill?

1874
01:39:11,452 --> 01:39:12,980
If I had not known
about that fifth person,

1875
01:39:13,284 --> 01:39:15,140
I wouldn't have known about
the first four persons either.

1876
01:39:15,369 --> 01:39:19,600
Does it mean that you want to face him
despite knowing his position and power?

1877
01:39:20,302 --> 01:39:22,869
Are you questioning my calibre
even after witnessing all this?

1878
01:39:22,994 --> 01:39:25,199
Does it mean that you know
the man behind these attacks?

1879
01:39:25,244 --> 01:39:26,660
[breathes deeply] Yes. I do.

1880
01:39:26,869 --> 01:39:27,474
You know him?

1881
01:39:27,613 --> 01:39:30,766
When you can't save
yourself, how can you face him?

1882
01:39:30,866 --> 01:39:33,461
You said it yourself that he is
in a position of high stature.

1883
01:39:33,685 --> 01:39:36,102
Didn't you ever consider that this
was a ruse to get him out in the open?

1884
01:39:36,702 --> 01:39:39,902
So, does that mean you are still using me?

1885
01:39:41,369 --> 01:39:42,925
I leave that to your interpretation.

1886
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:44,378
So, you are implying that
you are going to kill him?

1887
01:39:45,452 --> 01:39:46,452
Certainly!

1888
01:39:46,485 --> 01:39:48,052
Then, what's the difference
between both of you?

1889
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:50,952
Who are the good ones
between Pandavas and Kauravas?

1890
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:51,660
Pandavas.

1891
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:53,660
Why? Both of them were indulged
in a battle, aren't they?

1892
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:55,457
Pandavas fought for the right reasons.

1893
01:39:57,119 --> 01:39:58,854
Don't you think you figured
out the answer yourself?

1894
01:39:58,954 --> 01:40:01,487
Nonetheless, I will not stay still. I
will stop you from committing that murder.

1895
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:04,119
-All the best.
-You too.

1896
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:22,802
Anu, I am going out.

1897
01:40:27,578 --> 01:40:27,994
[indistinct car honks]

1898
01:40:30,494 --> 01:40:31,202
Dhana...

1899
01:40:32,907 --> 01:40:33,467
[gasps]

1900
01:40:35,254 --> 01:40:37,012
[tyres screech]

1901
01:40:42,952 --> 01:40:43,480
Anu...

1902
01:40:45,285 --> 01:40:45,820
Anu...

1903
01:40:50,228 --> 01:40:51,556
Hey...

1904
01:40:57,452 --> 01:40:57,981
Anu...

1905
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:21,839
[clangs]

1906
01:41:24,277 --> 01:41:25,235
-Anu...
-Dhana...

1907
01:41:37,436 --> 01:41:37,941
[groans]

1908
01:41:51,793 --> 01:41:52,361
Anu...

1909
01:41:55,952 --> 01:41:56,567
Come, Dhana...

1910
01:41:58,126 --> 01:41:58,889
[groans]

1911
01:42:01,642 --> 01:42:05,257
-[stabs]
-[groans]

1912
01:42:05,931 --> 01:42:06,379
[gasps]

1913
01:42:10,077 --> 01:42:10,785
Dhana...

1914
01:42:13,511 --> 01:42:15,895
[groans]

1915
01:42:18,827 --> 01:42:19,726
Wait, sir!

1916
01:42:24,285 --> 01:42:26,644
How can his death be as simple
as being hit by a single bullet?

1917
01:42:28,035 --> 01:42:31,485
I have many bullets to kill
this human-turned-animal.

1918
01:42:31,585 --> 01:42:33,673
Please take him to the hospital first.

1919
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:35,255
Anu... I can leave you in this condition.

1920
01:42:35,535 --> 01:42:38,216
Forget about me.
I don't care what happens to me.

1921
01:42:38,616 --> 01:42:41,390
Please kill him for the sake
of your mother's mission.

1922
01:42:43,702 --> 01:42:44,565
Thus far,

1923
01:42:44,589 --> 01:42:47,094
there was never a time when good lost
in the battle between good and evil.

1924
01:42:47,577 --> 01:42:49,652
And, it won't lose now either.
This man has to survive.

1925
01:42:50,124 --> 01:42:51,087
-Go on, now.
-Anu...

1926
01:42:52,823 --> 01:42:53,320
Anu...

1927
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:54,071
Go now.

1928
01:42:56,286 --> 01:42:59,614
[groans]

1929
01:43:03,369 --> 01:43:06,202
Shall we talk now..., dad?

1930
01:43:07,369 --> 01:43:10,828
Hey... My daughter wants
to talk. Get her a chair.

1931
01:43:20,744 --> 01:43:22,625
When my daughter whom I have
thought she is long-deceased,

1932
01:43:23,512 --> 01:43:26,010
sits in front of me with my late
wife Aravinda's features,

1933
01:43:27,646 --> 01:43:28,554
I would talk with her for sure.

1934
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:34,452
I knew that you were alive and
arranged for people to kill you.

1935
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:37,077
But this ACP kept saving you all through.

1936
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:39,502
That was a wonderful plan, dear!

1937
01:43:39,702 --> 01:43:44,619
Suicide... Sleepwalking and the
transformer blowing up. Excellent!

1938
01:43:45,535 --> 01:43:47,910
Of course, its because you are my blood.

1939
01:43:48,110 --> 01:43:48,538
[scoffs]

1940
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:49,986
A daughter on par with her father.

1941
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:53,660
Nonetheless, instead of taking
efforts and killing those four people,

1942
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:56,626
you could have approached
me directly and killed me.

1943
01:43:56,906 --> 01:43:59,256
Why? Didn't you remember me?

1944
01:44:00,019 --> 01:44:01,319
Of course, I remembered you, dad!

1945
01:44:01,886 --> 01:44:04,761
In the past twenty years, every time I
closed my eyes and thought of my mother...

1946
01:44:18,837 --> 01:44:21,403
Its very hard to save a life...
However, taking it...

1947
01:44:22,369 --> 01:44:23,074
[slits]

1948
01:44:24,302 --> 01:44:25,592
I couldn't see my mother.

1949
01:44:26,473 --> 01:44:28,153
All I could see was you,
who killed my mother.

1950
01:44:30,119 --> 01:44:31,861
I grew up with that nightmare.

1951
01:44:33,035 --> 01:44:36,035
My revenge is not just
because you killed my mother.

1952
01:44:36,702 --> 01:44:38,444
It is because you've
killed mom's vision as well.

1953
01:44:40,296 --> 01:44:42,736
And that is the reason I've killed all
those others responsible for her death...

1954
01:44:42,934 --> 01:44:43,600
...and then I came to you

1955
01:44:44,105 --> 01:44:46,141
[scoffs] That's
your perception.

1956
01:44:46,762 --> 01:44:50,244
But I've made you come here by
putting your friend's life as bait.

1957
01:44:50,577 --> 01:44:52,323
You killed your own son.

1958
01:44:52,819 --> 01:44:54,787
I don't think anyone else's life
matters to you in the least.

1959
01:44:56,619 --> 01:44:59,477
I am the daughter that you were supposed
to pamper for the entirety of your life.

1960
01:44:59,952 --> 01:45:00,867
You tried to kill me.

1961
01:45:03,244 --> 01:45:05,642
But those four persons died to save me.

1962
01:45:05,842 --> 01:45:06,299
Hey!

1963
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,210
Why are you wasting your time
thinking of those lost lives

1964
01:45:10,812 --> 01:45:12,435
instead of focussing on saving
your life from my hands?

1965
01:45:12,635 --> 01:45:13,182
Damn!

1966
01:45:13,410 --> 01:45:14,215
Even your mother was like this.

1967
01:45:14,407 --> 01:45:16,501
She is always concerned
about her village and her people.

1968
01:45:16,846 --> 01:45:19,669
She wants to spend our
property for the welfare of the others,

1969
01:45:19,988 --> 01:45:21,956
instead of spending it for our happiness.

1970
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:26,793
I, Raghu Ram, married
Aravinda for her wealth,

1971
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:30,577
for the fame, for the power that
would gain much more wealth.

1972
01:45:31,727 --> 01:45:32,804
I couldn't take it.

1973
01:45:35,535 --> 01:45:38,035
In this world, it's a challenge
to live the life of an honest man.

1974
01:45:38,244 --> 01:45:43,244
It is even a greater challenge to pretend
as a honest man without being suspected.

1975
01:45:43,827 --> 01:45:46,136
And that's the reason
why I have removed the mask.

1976
01:45:49,785 --> 01:45:53,452
And that is how I am currently at
the position of a central minister.

1977
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:55,785
Will your position last until your death?

1978
01:45:56,494 --> 01:45:59,615
Even if it is so, you
might die as a minister...

1979
01:46:00,015 --> 01:46:02,994
but my mother is still alive as a goddess
in the hearts of those people, dad.

1980
01:46:05,369 --> 01:46:08,119
To save a handful of lives,
my mother began a Yagna(ritual).

1981
01:46:08,452 --> 01:46:11,077
And you've joined hands with those who
were opposing it and backstabbed her.

1982
01:46:11,677 --> 01:46:14,559
I killed the other four and along with
them I wanted to kill you as well.

1983
01:46:15,952 --> 01:46:18,189
But I couldn't kill you that easily, dad.

1984
01:46:18,389 --> 01:46:19,535
Do you know why?

1985
01:46:21,318 --> 01:46:22,827
I wanted to meet you at
least once and ask you

1986
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:28,489
"How could you do this to a daughter
whom have raised so dearly for 5 years?"

1987
01:46:30,611 --> 01:46:32,351
You've held my fingers
and taught me how to walk.

1988
01:46:33,021 --> 01:46:34,633
You made me see the
world through your eyes.

1989
01:46:35,651 --> 01:46:37,609
Why did you change all of a sudden, dad?

1990
01:46:41,552 --> 01:46:46,349
I am an inheritance for billions.
You brought me up as a princess.

1991
01:46:47,585 --> 01:46:49,506
I've begged on the streets, dad.

1992
01:46:52,090 --> 01:46:55,884
My stomach burned because of hunger
and my heart burned with your betrayal.

1993
01:46:58,294 --> 01:46:59,913
Neither was I in the
age of bearing that pain

1994
01:47:00,013 --> 01:47:01,265
nor there was anyone who could console me.

1995
01:47:04,619 --> 01:47:06,619
And that is when I met
Dhana, at an orphanage.

1996
01:47:08,152 --> 01:47:10,195
I thought it was my mother
who came in the form of Dhana.

1997
01:47:11,985 --> 01:47:15,178
Since then, he has been my mother,
father, friend... everything.

1998
01:47:15,378 --> 01:47:17,592
And now, you tried to kill
him for your selfish gain.

1999
01:47:20,035 --> 01:47:23,280
A daughter cries incessantly
after coming out of mother's womb,

2000
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:26,033
but she stops crying at once when she
is held by her father on his chest.

2001
01:47:26,137 --> 01:47:27,659
Do you know why?

2002
01:47:29,327 --> 01:47:31,196
It's because she gets assured
that her father has her back...

2003
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:32,252
...no matter whatever
problem she faces in this world.

2004
01:47:33,047 --> 01:47:35,156
It's the courage that his hug gives her.

2005
01:47:37,712 --> 01:47:40,173
But you have become my problem, dad.

2006
01:47:46,285 --> 01:47:48,382
I wonder what is there
for you with the power...

2007
01:47:48,474 --> 01:47:49,774
...that you have achieved
by killing your kins.

2008
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:54,028
I know you wouldn't reform
despite my explanation.

2009
01:47:55,142 --> 01:47:57,481
Even if I do share your blood,

2010
01:47:57,537 --> 01:48:00,684
I will not be the unconscientious
one who kills her kin.

2011
01:48:06,035 --> 01:48:08,441
But doesn't war mean
that some party has to lose?

2012
01:48:10,577 --> 01:48:11,971
I leave the choice to you.

2013
01:48:13,244 --> 01:48:14,737
Since you are used to killing,

2014
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:19,270
take away the life that you gave me.

2015
01:48:40,018 --> 01:48:40,959
[gun fires]

2016
01:48:45,241 --> 01:48:45,938
[gasps]

2017
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:50,244
[takes heavy breath]
