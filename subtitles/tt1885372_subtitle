00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:16,975
You must give them that confidence.
Ok?

173
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:21,508
One final advice!
Anger itself is the enemy.

174
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:22,970
Do not forget.

175
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:41,646
When we believe that killing
the criminals and offenders,

176
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:46,079
Would bring welfare to
thousands of people,

177
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:50,170
We have been doing the same even
now after we make a discussion on it,

178
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,306
And also giving some warnings.

179
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:58,768
But presently,
in order to announce our strength,

180
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,856
and to deprive the police strength,

181
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:08,280
It is not a right thing to brutally kill
the innocent cops who wouldn't bug us.

182
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:13,162
I did not like our act.
They are also humans like us.

183
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:18,508
Chandra, why didn't you bother to
tell me when you were doing this?

184
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:22,479
Mr Gopal Reddy, why do you talk
like this? Are the police innocent?

185
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,324
They have been unfairly killing
many of our people in a brutal way.

186
00:16:25,827 --> 00:16:27,413
They are killing innocent people for us.

187
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:30,666
Gone are those days when we used to bring
change by conducting rallies and meetings.

188
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:33,423
The answer for that is tit for a tat.

189
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:40,185
It is alright if some of us
even die in this war unknowingly.

190
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:45,092
Listening to you all these days, we used
to think of achieving it all in five years.

191
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:47,347
It is fifteen years now and
what have we achieved?

192
00:16:47,377 --> 00:16:51,476
It is wrong Chandra.
A change does not come so fast.

193
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,576
This is a war from 1000 years.

194
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:57,058
It is not our policy,

195
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,490
to take revenge on police for losing
many of our people as said by you.

196
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:01,976
We are people thinking to
do something for the public.

197
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,407
In such a case,
public should fear seeing us.

198
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:10,102
Our war is for all the public to live
fearless, with equality and independent.

199
00:17:10,344 --> 00:17:13,820
But, with such practices it is
a loss for us and nothing else.

200
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:22,008
Reddy Sir, you have grown old.
You are fearing for everything.

201
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:28,664
It is better for us all to
once sit and talk about you.

202
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:34,161
That means you do not need me.

203
00:17:35,883 --> 00:17:37,264
Am I grown old?

What Chanti, looks like you
got a new dress stitched?

222

Today is birthday of Chanti, dude.

-Good colour dude.
-Yes, right?

224
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:52,555
I got it stitched in Rajahmundry
and it costed a lot dude.

225
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,690
-How much for this?
-Why for you, bloody?

-Oh no, Baby!

property of your wife.

I too will see how she does not give it.

and this houses are cut.

-Leave the wall.

You built at your height so that
I cannot see my daughter.

327
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:34,433
Due to my bad fate, I gave my daughter
to you in marriage with wealthy properties.

328
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,163
But you gambled it all going for prestige,

329
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,867
and finally left her with
just her chain in neck.

330
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:45,691
Maybe you have been watching out for
the property my daughter would get if I die.

331
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:51,251
I will not die so soon. Stop that
over action and try to earn money.

333
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:56,010

-Tumbler is gone.

506
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:26,936
-Have you seen?
-Yes.

507
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,551
-Leave now, then.
-We are leaving.

508
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,983
Will we stay back instead of leaving
or what? This bloody fellow in between.

509
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,341
Leave it, it costs 50 paisa again.

510
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:38,287
You leaving those making fun of you
and hitting me for eating two tomatoes,

511
00:36:38,421 --> 00:36:39,385
You are great!

512
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:42,998
What Satyanarayana, how is
the health? Are you fine?

513
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:44,892
What is the news in the paper?

514
00:36:45,623 --> 00:36:48,507
It seems Baby has given some dress to
stitch and she asked me to enquire.

515
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:51,378
Oh tomorrow?
Is your health keeping fine?

516
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:54,158
-Take butter milk Bairagi.
-Are you fine?

517
00:36:54,198 --> 00:36:55,023
We are just living so.

518
00:36:55,251 --> 00:37:00,007
Thank God, work I came for is done.
Need to search for lunch now.

519
00:37:00,075 --> 00:37:02,151
What Laxmi,
you are not to be seen from four days?

520
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:06,197
I thought of coming myself,
but my maternal uncle has come.

521
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:10,657
I am too busy. I am trying a lot
to make that dumb face smile.

522
00:37:11,616 --> 00:37:13,161
It is almost impossible for me.

523
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:16,196
His face would be good
even if he does not smile.

524
00:37:16,316 --> 00:37:19,020
-Sorry madam.
-Ok, will you have a coffee?

525
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:20,924
-Coffee!
-No!

526
00:37:22,628 --> 00:37:27,917
No idea why but, I am forgetting
myself just by taking his name, Laxmi.

527
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:34,288
Ok, have you not found
any prince still? Hey, say the truth.

528
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:36,516
You naughty!

529
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,330
-You!
-Here.

530
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:46,433
Wow, have you stitched so
fast? Wow, it is so good.

531
00:37:47,086 --> 00:37:48,163
Bairagi!

532
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:54,089
If I wear this and try my uncle
on my birthday, he would get flat.

533
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:55,746
Here is the money Baby.

534
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:58,460
-Is your father fine dear?
-Yes

535
00:37:58,461 --> 00:38:00,861
-Why, what happened to him?
-You shut your mouth.

536
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:11,044
I will take leave.
Naughty girl!

537
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,112
That is a donating hand
but not the accepting one.

538
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:17,252
They lived great once.

539
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:20,627
Her father Satyanarayana owned
around two to three hundred acres once.

540
00:38:21,472 --> 00:38:24,879
He donated with one hand and
played cock fights with the other.

541
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:26,224
He finally left half an acre.

542
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:32,947
In that she is cultivating vegetables and
tailoring to run the house decently.

543
00:38:33,836 --> 00:38:37,696
If someone asks me who is the best
girl in this surrounding area,

544
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:39,112
I would say name of Laxmi.

545
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:41,912
-Does that mean Baby is not a good girl?
-You shut your mouth.

546
00:38:42,672 --> 00:38:43,904
That means,
am I not a good girl?

547
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:46,236
That is you are a naughty girl.

548
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:49,092
-Naughty girl means not a good girl, right?
-Don't trap me

550
00:39:05,837 --> 00:39:07,414

[Rooster crows]

552
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:15,649
Ramudu, if he listens would say
to run even in the afternoon.

553
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:18,524
What again, bloody?

554
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:20,666
Hey, I am an elder man.
I pray you, leave me.

555
00:39:20,731 --> 00:39:21,291
What to leave?

556
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:23,428
What about you, bloody?

557
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,181
You are a Police and you need exercise.

558
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:26,996
Why for us, you are killing
us early in the morning?

559
00:39:27,096 --> 00:39:29,462
Not just Police,
but everybody needs to exercise.

560
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:31,714
We can achieve anything only
when the body is fit enough.

561
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:34,223
-No, we will not do.
-Move, move on.

562
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:38,271
-What about you?
-What? Will you hit even me?

563
00:39:39,197 --> 00:39:41,119
-Move bloody.
-Oh no, he is really hit me.

[Thrashing]

565
00:39:54,578 --> 00:39:56,710
Hey, they are killing Malli
by beating up. Move.

566
00:39:58,455 --> 00:39:58,994
Stop!

567
00:40:01,577 --> 00:40:03,422
Why are you hitting him?
What has he done?

568
00:40:04,298 --> 00:40:06,062
What has he done, debt!

569
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:09,475
He mortgaged this land to him
and did marriage of his sister.

570
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:13,617
No idea about his accounts, but he
equalised the debt with this land.

571
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:16,961
He is beating him to sign for
this fertile land, right sir?

572
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:18,491
Bloody, will we be silent
if he is beating?

573
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:21,119
Come on, we shall go and give a complaint
in the Police station and settle his matter.

574
00:40:21,271 --> 00:40:25,635
What Bulliraju,
what is this Police Station newly?

575
00:40:26,686 --> 00:40:28,514
-Nothing would happen there.
-Nothing?

576
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:31,428
I will show you what a Police Station is.
Come, bloody fellow.

577
00:40:34,338 --> 00:40:35,056
Report?

578
00:40:35,156 --> 00:40:38,051
[Smacking]

579
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:43,122
What bloody?
You maintain a gang following?

580
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:46,270
What is the report you give
on Narayana, bloody?

581
00:40:46,637 --> 00:40:49,114
You revolt over Narayana, bloody?

582
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:53,801
Why are you not signing
when he is saying, bloody?

583
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:58,335
Who is in support here for you?
Sign, bloody.

584
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:05,363
Hey Bulliraju,
what is your relation with this Malli?

585
00:41:05,835 --> 00:41:10,326
Is he any relative to you?
Look, you are still in the training period.

586
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:15,118
If you involve into unnecessary issues, you
would lose even the job to come. Take care.

587
00:41:15,338 --> 00:41:18,562
-Get out bloody.
-Move on Bulliraju, why for us. Move.

588
00:41:19,346 --> 00:41:21,628
See you sir. Put on the buttons.
Move on guys.

589
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:23,033
Why all this for us, move.

590
00:41:24,669 --> 00:41:26,037
Why does he say how am I related?

591
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:29,317
Should only the people of the guy
getting hit ask? Should others not ask?

592
00:41:29,757 --> 00:41:32,057
To say a mistake as wrong,
we need not be his relative.

593
00:41:32,361 --> 00:41:33,741
Will we become a radical by questioning?

594
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:36,959
He is like a goon in dress,
but not like a Police.

595
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:39,079
That is why public lost respect
on the Police.

596
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:41,636
Hey, you would leave soon
to join in the job.

597
00:41:41,868 --> 00:41:43,000
Why all these issues of village for you?

598
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:46,823
Do not speak nonsense. Police station
means the Government in reach of public.

599
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:51,018
We are paying taxes and
giving them salaries for us.

600
00:41:51,338 --> 00:41:52,523
It is that they save us.

601
00:41:52,531 --> 00:41:55,027
Public is shivering to get
into the Police station.

602
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:56,531
They are fearing to the Police.

603
00:41:56,967 --> 00:42:01,363
We shall catch neck and question the Police
not working, but should not be frightened.

604
00:42:01,412 --> 00:42:03,064
We heard many as such.

would become double to him.

the anger over Police on Baby?

cry on her birthday.

02:18:46,481 --> 02:18:49,578
What is your entire Police department
doing? Are you sitting idle?

1693
02:18:49,802 --> 02:18:54,376
When they kidnapped a Minister in daytime,
we understand how waste are you?

1694
02:18:54,576 --> 02:18:56,849
We are spending crores of
public money on you.

1695
02:18:57,089 --> 02:19:01,851
When there is no safety for VIPs like us,
what about the common public?

1696
02:19:02,187 --> 02:19:07,452
I do not understand, is it the special
Police gone to catch them or waste fellows?

1697
02:19:07,559 --> 02:19:09,293
-You bloody!
-Prasad! Please.

1698
02:19:09,484 --> 02:19:12,583
Leave all this, as per their demands…
who is that fellow?

1699
02:19:12,683 --> 02:19:14,647
-Bairagi!
-Yes, release that Bairagi fellow.

1700
02:19:14,835 --> 02:19:16,905
Say if not, we will do
our arrangements.

1701
02:19:17,185 --> 02:19:20,278
We will get our leader out in
an hour. Why do you not say?

1702
02:19:20,886 --> 02:19:24,301
Shut up, not a word!
What are you blabbering bloody?

1703
02:19:24,781 --> 02:19:28,517
You want to become leader overnight
taking such situation as a chance?

1704
02:19:28,649 --> 02:19:29,806
You are raising too much
in front of the press.

1705
02:19:30,138 --> 02:19:31,499
What do you know
the value of life bloody?

1706
02:19:31,809 --> 02:19:34,066
Daily 10 Police men are dying there.

1707
02:19:34,438 --> 02:19:35,998
Why does no leader care about that?

1708
02:19:36,106 --> 02:19:39,122
But you are raising for just one
politician today like that Chalapati Rao.

1709
02:19:39,279 --> 02:19:41,352
Total nation knows about
him and his history.

1710
02:19:41,563 --> 02:19:45,875
Shall we leave that Bairagi whom we caught
risking our lives for that bloody fellow?

1711
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:49,632
Impossible and I will not leave him.
Do whatever you can.

1712
02:19:49,712 --> 02:19:51,838
If required, go and complain
with his father. I don't care.

1713
02:19:52,021 --> 02:19:54,178
-Prasad!
-Sir, the thing is...

1714
02:19:54,278 --> 02:19:55,200
-Look sir.
-Shut up.

1715
02:19:56,290 --> 02:20:00,957
We know better what and how to
do. You do not need to teach us.

1716
02:20:01,581 --> 02:20:05,696
We will solve this problem in
24 hours. Stay quiet till then.

1717
02:20:06,587 --> 02:20:12,204
I will peel your skin if you say
another word. Just shut up.

1718
02:20:13,446 --> 02:20:16,956
-Prasad, come on.
-Yes sir.

1719
02:20:20,644 --> 02:20:22,951
Why should we stay quiet sir?
Bloody idiots!

1720
02:20:24,090 --> 02:20:28,046
Goons and bloody pick
pocketers are turning into leaders sir.

1721
02:20:28,274 --> 02:20:30,150
We are having to stand before
them folding our hands.

1722
02:20:31,890 --> 02:20:36,656
When guys without a qualification even
to stand with us are saying nonsense.

1723
02:20:36,666 --> 02:20:38,817
My blood is boiling sir.
It is just intolerable.

1724
02:20:39,462 --> 02:20:45,393
Sir, just give me one chance.
I will push all these waste fellows in.

1725
02:20:45,569 --> 02:20:47,717
Total problem would be solved.
Yes!

1726
02:20:48,637 --> 02:20:49,937
Total problem would be solved.

1727
02:20:50,373 --> 02:20:53,854
Sir, seeing all this I feel
what Bulliraju did is correct.

1728
02:20:54,148 --> 02:20:59,427
I feel it is better to take off this dress
and join them instead of being so sir.

1729
02:20:59,737 --> 02:21:00,256
Yes sir!

1730
02:21:02,966 --> 02:21:05,210
-Prasad, control yourself.
-Sir, I...

1731
02:21:05,226 --> 02:21:08,970
Cool! This system is rotten.
I agree.

1732
02:21:09,594 --> 02:21:14,158
But even the remaining few sincere officers
like you also go, it would totally die.

1733
02:21:14,894 --> 02:21:18,923
It should not happen so.
I know about that bloody Chalapati Rao.

1734
02:21:19,437 --> 02:21:24,423
But if we do not save him now, public
loses the smallest confidence having on us.

1735
02:21:25,183 --> 02:21:26,454
Strength of terrorism would go up.

1736
02:21:27,321 --> 02:21:32,250
Problem then would become
bigger. No, do not spare them.

1737
02:21:33,717 --> 02:21:37,957
Kill that Bulliraju and his
entire group. Shoot them.

1738
02:21:38,826 --> 02:21:40,624
-Sir!
-There is no other way Prasad.

1739
02:21:41,862 --> 02:21:45,623
No problem even if Chalapati Rao
dies in that effort, I do not care.

1740
02:21:48,044 --> 02:21:48,575
Kill them.

1741
02:21:55,455 --> 02:22:00,139
Akashvani, local news by
Mahankali Vijayakumar. 

1742
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:03,985
Home Minister informed that
Government is taking all actions 

1743
02:22:04,226 --> 02:22:07,746
 to free Minister Chalapati Rao
kidnapped by the terrorists. 

1744
02:22:08,299 --> 02:22:12,752
Their demand to release
the terrorist named Bairagi 

1745
02:22:13,008 --> 02:22:16,735
and the abduction of minister Chalapati
Rao is known to all the listeners. 

1746
02:22:17,149 --> 02:22:19,910
-Their demand to release Bairagi,
-Please don't kill me.

1747
02:22:20,110 --> 02:22:22,297
Time limit of 48 hours given
by terrorists is getting out. 

1748
02:22:22,754 --> 02:22:25,817
Home Minister clarified that they cannot
release the dreaded terrorist Bairagi 

1749
02:22:26,146 --> 02:22:32,530
as this would become a habit for terrorists. 

1750
02:22:32,830 --> 02:22:35,025
He said to be knowing how
to get Minister released 

1751
02:22:35,149 --> 02:22:40,701
 and would supress the terrorism strongly. 

1752
02:22:41,083 --> 02:22:46,800
Chief Minister in foreign tour condemning
this act seriously has advised terrorists 

1753
02:22:46,996 --> 02:22:49,520
to leave their cruelty and get into public life. 

1754
02:22:49,523 --> 02:22:56,178
CM has warned that terrorists may have to
face severe actions by not following this. 

1755
02:22:56,578 --> 02:23:00,169
-Here ends the local news.
-I beg you, do not kill me.

1756
02:23:00,395 --> 02:23:05,003
Sir, I have wife and kids.
Do not kill me please.

1757
02:23:05,283 --> 02:23:08,880
I will hand you over the 25 crores
earned with the support of my father.

1758
02:23:09,089 --> 02:23:10,120
Please do not kill me.

1759
02:23:10,617 --> 02:23:14,273
I will not continue at all in politics.
Please do not kill me.

1760
02:23:14,929 --> 02:23:17,869
I will not be in this country and
leave abroad.

1761
02:23:18,045 --> 02:23:19,571
Do not kill me.

Thank God.
[Gasping]

1765
02:23:57,966 --> 02:24:01,646
One after another is dying.
What Balu said was correct.

1766
02:24:02,182 --> 02:24:05,127
I feel frightened.
Not that I will die.

1767
02:24:05,569 --> 02:24:08,435
I am not understanding who is
killing whom and for what here.

1768
02:24:08,838 --> 02:24:11,486
I came here for Bulliraju.
I will do anything for Bulliraju.

1769
02:24:12,174 --> 02:24:15,582
But now, even Bulliraju is not correct.

1770
02:24:16,234 --> 02:24:18,836
This will not match for us.
I am thinking to leave from here.

1771
02:24:20,866 --> 02:24:25,690
I know that you like me.

1772
02:24:26,370 --> 02:24:27,242
Bairagi has said me.

1773
02:24:28,318 --> 02:24:32,145
I am thinking to marry you.
That too if you like it.

1774
02:24:36,061 --> 02:24:37,101
You do not need to say immediately.

1775
02:24:37,591 --> 02:24:41,691
If you like me and have confidence on me,

1776
02:24:42,835 --> 02:24:44,367
it is enough if you put
this necklace in your neck.

1777
02:24:45,422 --> 02:24:48,186
It is like you agreed.
I will immediately talk to Bulliraju.

1778
02:24:51,696 --> 02:24:52,415
Think well.

Bulliraju!

1862
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:53,393
Bulliraju!

1863
02:33:56,033 --> 02:33:56,787
Bulliraju!

1864
02:33:59,047 --> 02:33:59,827
Bulliraju!

1865
02:34:02,670 --> 02:34:03,572
Bulliraju!

1866
02:34:08,964 --> 02:34:10,036
Bulliraju!

1867
02:34:13,231 --> 02:34:19,154
[Weeping]

1868
02:34:22,969 --> 02:34:28,873
[Music]

1869
02:34:51,603 --> 02:34:57,439
[Silence]

1870
02:35:08,836 --> 02:35:10,361
The End!

1871
02:35:10,862 --> 02:35:16,786
When is the end for this killing spree?
And where?

1872
02:35:36,904 --> 02:35:41,324
"Leaving out the chance
to write his own fate"

1873
02:35:41,521 --> 02:35:45,916
"Electing fear within and the
injustice as representatives"

1874
02:35:46,209 --> 02:35:50,529
"Forgetting to question the breed
feeling theirs as democracy"

1875
02:35:50,796 --> 02:35:55,440
"Anger is it seems driving this
blinded breed having eyes"

1876
02:35:57,716 --> 02:36:02,458
"It seems the power orders
saying to have that right"

1877
02:36:04,875 --> 02:36:08,994
"This cruelty happening in the
Kurukshtra war without Lord Krishna"

1878
02:36:09,094 --> 02:36:11,449
"Is the decoration of the fire on corpses!"

1879
02:36:11,875 --> 02:36:15,843
"Will you still sleep seeing this,
my wide spread nation?"

1880
02:36:16,020 --> 02:36:18,660
"Hey my widely spread nation!"

1881
02:36:18,912 --> 02:36:22,788
"Shall we claim the ignorance of
the half a century as independence,"

1882
02:36:22,948 --> 02:36:25,571
"Shall we do golden jubilee
celebrations for the same?"
