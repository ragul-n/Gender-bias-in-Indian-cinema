1
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,840
'Just now I feel relieved'

2
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,640
'Only good things will happen to us now.'

3
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,760
'Senthil, I hope you're right about this.'

4
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,720
I feel like we made a mistake
sparing Thambi.

5
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,560
No, we did the right thing.

6
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,160
If we'd killed him too,
the people would have turned against us.

7
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,120
That's true.

8
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,320
Give me that.

9
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,000
Jayalalitha will come to power next...

10
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,800
We can do our business undisturbed
for the next twenty five years.

11
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,520
What say?

12
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,640
But we've murdered a big hand.

13
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,360
It will earn us as much
danger as respect.

14
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,280
We can't risk going to prison together.
They'll kill us in there.

15
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,720
Two of us must run the business,
and two of us must go to prison.

16
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,320
That thought that their troubles are over

17
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,280
Seldom do they realised that,
that will turn their lives to the worse

18
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,120
Pazhani and I will make some money here
and bail you out in a month.

19
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,120
That death will chase them forever

20
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,400
Father's name?
- Shanmugam.

21
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,320
- Identification marks?
- Tattoo on the right arm...

22
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,160
Guna?

23
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,560
- Father's name?
- Kathavarayan.

24
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,480
Identification marks?

25
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,800
Believing Senthil's words that
will bail them out, they went to jail

26
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,600
But Guna and Velu were in jail for 1 year

27
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,480
To avoid enmity Thambi brought
Senthil to the jail to convince them

28
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,880
It pains me to see you all like this.

29
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,760
What to do?

30
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,240
Just your bad luck, I guess.

31
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,440
We're not in here
because no one can bail us out.

32
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,960
You promised to bail us out.
You better bail us out.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
If you don't,
and we come out...

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,760
Look, Pazhani!

35
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,760
He threatens us because he doesn't know
how we've grown when he was holed up here.

36
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,320
My boys are out there.

37
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,560
They'd chop you into little pieces.

38
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,760
Senthil, they 'took' the case
because you gave your word.

39
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,000
Betraying a friend is the greatest sin.

40
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,280
Mani...

41
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,840
I don't have the ruling party's
support right now.

42
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
I have to bribe everyone.

43
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,240
I couldn't do anything.

44
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,360
What's the hurry?

45
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Next elections, our party
will come to power.

46
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,520
We've been here for a year already!

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,680
You want us to stay locked in
for another six months?

48
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,360
Doing business out there is not easy...

49
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,800
unlike smoking pot, eating and sleeping
inside a prison cell.

50
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,880
It's tough work.

51
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,080
We 'took' the case.
How is it tough for you?

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,840
Mani, ask them to shut up
about 'taking' the case!

53
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,680
There are boys out there willing to
do it for booze and biryani rice.

54
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,640
This is a first-class case.

55
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,280
They'd have been honoured to
'take' this case and remained loyal forever.

56
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
- I'm not talking to you.
- Okay, big-shot.

57
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,000
Watch your mouth!

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,520
That death has started its work

59
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
Stop it!

60
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,040
I only kept quiet that day
so that all the fighting would stop.

61
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,200
I wanted you all to stay united
and settle down in life.

62
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,280
Senthil, bail them out soon.

63
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,040
Guna, when you come out,
don't hold any grudge.

64
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,160
'North Chennai'

65
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,640
Duty parties...

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
Attention.

67
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
All duty parties present, sir!

68
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm not bothered about
how you operated until now.

69
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,400
During my tenure, I only want men
who work for government's money.

70
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,320
If you're not willing to comply,
request a transfer.

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
I'll recommend your transfer.

72
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,280
No more marijuana, weapons,
cell phones, alcohol, cocaine...

73
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,040
or any contraband goods.

74
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,000
Any transactions or under-the-table deals
with the inmates...

75
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,160
and you'll find yourself locked up
in this very prison.

76
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,360
If you have any problems or grievances,
I'm always reachable.

77
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,560
The inflow of drugs is completely
controlled by one man.

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,440
Senthil.

79
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,640
He has a huge network
to smuggle and sell drugs.

80
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,080
Police officials, jailers,
even the prison doctor...

81
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,440
they're all on his payroll.

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,120
Senthil's enterprise in the prison
is managed by...

83
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,920
Dass.

84
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,600
He calls all the shots
on supply and distribution.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
They operate like a
Multi Level Marketing system.

86
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,520
One guy handles the drugs,
while someone else handles the money.

87
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,880
If we catch the guy with drugs, he knows
nothing about the money and vice versa.

88
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,200
The most important mule
in smuggling drugs into prison...

89
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,880
Raju.

90
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,960
He is a very important link in
Senthil's flourishing business.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
If they face any problems in
smuggling through the visitation room...

92
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,520
mules like him would
just stuff it inside them.

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,160
They call it 'Pepsi'.

94
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,320
Despite all our checks,
he finds a way to smuggle it in.

95
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,720
He is the King of mules.

96
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,000
Across all prisons, Senthil earns about
2 lakhs every single day.

97
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,760
Senthil stays in the 7th block.

98
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,520
Every inmate in that block
works for him.

99
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,720
They fear nothing.

100
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,040
I am safe in here.

101
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,280
Officials who go to raid his block
face life threats.

102
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,440
Everyone is scared
to even enter his block.

103
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,080
No one enters or leaves the block
without his permission.

104
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,840
Next time they come
for a raid, kill them.

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,200
For now, spare them.

106
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,920
Senthil has political aspirations.

107
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,120
So he is in prison now
to clear his past criminal records.

108
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Before he could clear his record,
Guna wants to kill Senthil in the prison.

109
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
Their rivalry goes way back.

110
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,920
Velu is the mastermind
behind Guna.

111
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,840
Velu's brother, Siva.

112
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,800
They mainly control land grabbing,
kangaroo courts and trade unions.

113
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,920
Your phone is ringing off the hook.
You should answer it.

114
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,760
Hello?

115
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,680
When?

116
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,120
We had nothing to do
with your daughter's disappearance.

117
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,360
Dad, little sister is missing
from school.

118
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,200
Return the contract to us,
she'll be home in an hour.

119
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,680
If you choose to go to Senthil
for protection...

120
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,560
you'll lose one member
of your family every week.

121
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
Consider this friendly advice.

122
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,240
When Senthil is in prison,
he never leaves the 7th Block.

123
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,240
If he steps out of his
block,

124
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,360
 Guna's men from the 11th block
are waiting to kill him.

125
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,280
Their rivalry started several years ago
after they committed a murder together.

126
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,280
They have made weapons
with kitchen utensils

127
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,160
Guna's boys in the 11th Block
are led by his trusted friend...

128
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,080
Mani.

129
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,120
He's been like a Godfather to all of them
since Rajan's times.

130
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,000
Just keeping their gang fights under control
is a huge problem, sir.

131
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,200
This prison is under my control now.
No more drugs. No more gangs.

132
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,200
'Many seemingly unrelated events
come together at one point.'

133
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,840
That death affected Anbu's life also

134
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,320
A scar each in the hand and forehead

135
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,880
Go.

136
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,760
Next!

137
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,840
Take this.

138
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,920
- Sir!
- Hello, sir.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,720
What's the case?

140
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,080
These two beat up each other.

141
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,520
And they attacked a cop
who tried to intervene.

142
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,240
They must have fought
over some chick.

143
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,880
Hit the nail on the head!
He's the smartest cop in this prison.

144
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,560
- Check that loud-mouth again.
- But you've already checked me!

145
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,800
- Go back to the checking room.
- You want to see it again?

146
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,520
Siva.

147
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,040
- Father's name?
- Shanmugam.

148
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,200
You should be..

149
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,200
You said you had nothing.

150
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,360
What's this, then?

151
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,680
- How many you got in there?
- Just this one, sir.

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,960
I know you too well!

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,720
Remove every 'Pepsi'
you've got in there.

154
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,840
That's disgusting.
At least use your other hand, sir!

155
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,720
Oh, this hospitality is not good enough?

156
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,440
Come, I'll kill you

157
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,720
Is your backside
a goods carrier or what?

158
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,400
What is your case?

159
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,920
You know that, sir

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,440
Sir, how can I go
with my rivals?

161
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,400
I won't hurt you.
Don't be scared.

162
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,200
Be quiet, Siva.
Start walking, everybody.

163
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,880
Let's go.

164
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,000
Come on.

165
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Move, everybody.

166
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,360
What's your problem
with that rowdy?

167
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,040
Sir, this will only complicate
things for you.

168
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,440
They've already hoisted the flag.
We'll send you to your block tomorrow.

169
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,440
You can't spend one night
in Quarantine?

170
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,040
They are terrified of Senthil's gang.

171
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,160
You! Red shirt...
Come here.

172
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,400
- First day in prison?
- Yes.

173
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,960
- Which case?
- Assault.

174
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,800
There are two rules in prison.
Don't lie, don't steal.

175
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,240
You need to behave.
Get it?

176
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,160
Does your family know
you're in remand?

177
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,080
This ends today.

178
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes, they do.

179
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,040
- You've got a lawyer to move bail?
- Get him!

180
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,400
Why did you come in the way?

181
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,720
I've got my eyes on you.
This is not over.

182
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,440
You saved my life, brother.

183
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,120
The guy who tried
to stab me is Siva.

184
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,040
We've been at each other's
throats for a while now.

185
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,200
I know I'll be the guy
who kills him someday.

186
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,560
There are two major gangs
in Central Prison.

187
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,560
Senthil's and Guna's.

188
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,120
Those guys back there are
Senthil's men, like me.

189
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,960
Whereas Siva is from Guna's gang.

190
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,600
The jailers are thrashing Siva
for the murder attempt.

191
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,920
Guna's men will definitely
hold it against you.

192
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,920
But you don't worry.

193
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,440
You risked your life
to save mine...

194
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,360
I'll speak to Senthil
and get you protection.

195
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,280
The one with the bandage?
That's the guy.

196
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,720
By the way, that is Velu.
Siva's older brother.

197
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,320
Tell the jailer he's ours.

198
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,600
I think they're taking you in.

199
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,880
Let's hope they don't
put you in Guna's block.

200
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,840
They want that guy
in the 11th block, sir.

201
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,280
- Shanmugam.
- Eve teasing, sir.

202
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,480
- Raju.
- Sir?

203
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,280
If you end up in their block,
just hang in there.

204
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,640
I'll try to get you
into my block.

205
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,840
All of you go to the 7th block

206
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Form a line.

207
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,240
"I'm stuck doing prison chores;
My nights in here are sleepless."

208
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,120
"There is no escape from here;
When will I ever be free?"

209
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,360
Poor thing... he saved me
and now he's in trouble.

210
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,120
Dass, will you speak to
Senthil and get him moved to our block?

211
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,080
Go on, boy.

212
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,280
I said, move.

213
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,320
Velu, where is Siva?

214
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,560
He's getting discharged
from the hospital tomorrow.

215
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,640
Heard they bashed him up?

216
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,680
All thanks to this son of a gun.

217
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,560
What are you staring at?

218
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,000
Keep walking.

219
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,680
Come on, man.

220
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,880
Don't look at him.
Just come.

221
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,080
- Mani...
- Yes?

222
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,560
This is the boy.

223
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,400
I'll call you back.

224
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,960
- What's your name?
- I'm Anbu.

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,440
For the second time,
he's gotten my brother into trouble.

226
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,600
He saved Senthil's mule yesterday.

227
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,600
I could kill him!

228
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,840
Leave the boy alone.

229
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,920
Sampath...

230
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,200
- You're leaving on bail tomorrow?
- Yes!

231
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,560
Velu, let this boy take over
as our helper here.

232
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,360
The foreigners in our prison...

233
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,120
cook their rations of beef and pork
and sell it to the gangs.

234
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,360
- Hi, Hans! How are you?
- Hey Sampath! I'm good.

235
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,680
- This is my friend, Anbu.
- Hi.

236
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,400
- New admission.
- Oh, new admission.

237
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,760
The usual?

238
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
No, no, no, no.

239
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,960
One special. Me.

240
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,200
- I give money.
- Okay.

241
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,080
Get down!

242
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,760
Break it.

243
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,560
You're injecting liquor
into coconuts?

244
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,680
You should just obey the bosses.

245
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,400
These are dangerous men.
Understood?

246
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay.

247
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,160
What's most important
is the first visitation.

248
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,920
When someone comes to visit you...

249
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,760
have them bring twenty cartons of biscuits,
fifty rolls of beedies and ten blankets.

250
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,520
Or your block mates won't respect you.

251
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't have anyone
to visit me.

252
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,920
Then you'll just have to
be a helper like me.

253
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,200
Hand these wads to the boss' wife.

254
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,880
- Is this all?
- There is a new superintendent...

255
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,240
Why would you step on food, sir?

256
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,200
Oh yeah?
That's food?

257
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,320
You bribe the officials
and smuggle drugs in?

258
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,320
From now, everything goes in
after screening in the petition room.

259
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,480
Without my orders, nothing enters
through these gates.

260
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Someone from the Party
is pulling the strings...

261
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,680
that's why the Superintendent
choking us.

262
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Let him.
He will come around.

263
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,440
He'll see what happens
when there's no drugs in prison.

264
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,280
"I was heavy-hitter...
But in here I'm just a number."

265
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,720
"I was heavy-hitter...
But in here I'm just a number."

266
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,920
They'll help themselves.
Just grab that rice bucket.

267
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,920
"In Central Prison -
It rains whacks from the baton."

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,960
Serve me some gravy.

269
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Pour more

270
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,240
Enough

271
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,720
Serve everyone.

272
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,960
The meat.

273
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,720
He says it will work out.

274
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,560
Excuse me...

275
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,560
He bought that meat
out of his own pocket.

276
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,800
It's just...

277
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,480
maybe he can put aside some for himself
before serving it to others...

278
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,120
Take this jar of water
and clean up the toilet.

279
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,600
You heard him.
Just do it.

280
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,640
Sampath, come here.

281
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,760
Kneel down.

282
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,200
Where did you get money
for the meat?

283
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,040
I saved a penny here and there.

284
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,560
Where and where?

285
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,240
Here and there...

286
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,760
I've told you time and again.
No stealing or lying in prison.

287
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,720
Don't untie that string
while scrubbing the toilet.

288
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,040
You'll find a phone in there.
Put that aside and clean.

289
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,640
Everyone, step outside.

290
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,880
Everybody, out!

291
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,160
Mani, hand over your phone.

292
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,920
If you want to seize phones and drugs,
go to Senthil's block.

293
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,760
The new superintendent
has asked us to raid...

294
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,520
Your men are searching anyway.
See if you can find it.

295
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,680
If you surrender it yourself,
things will be easier.

296
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,480
Sir...

297
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
I know where it is.

298
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,880
Get it for us.

299
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,080
Get that guy out of here.

300
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're not going anywhere.
You, come with me.

301
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,560
But I think the officer meant him...

302
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,280
Where are you from, boy?

303
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,120
Erode.

304
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,800
Where's that guy
who gave us the phone?

305
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,400
Oh, I thought you wanted this guy.

306
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
Go check on him.
Quick!

307
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,560
It's important for
a carom player to...

308
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,240
protect their hand
from getting injured.

309
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,960
Anbu is in jail because
he's an ace carom player

310
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,400
ANBU - THE GAME - PADMA

311
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,560
'Anbu was the best player
in Singaravelar Club...'

312
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,360
'So people took him to play
in the gambling dens.'

313
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,640
'Anbu was taken to his first ever
gambling match by Siva...'

314
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,880
'...the same Siva who just
threatened to kill him.'

315
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,040
My friend is such a good player.

316
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,840
But no one is betting on him?

317
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,040
Leave it, man

318
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,520
When Anbu wins,
we'll wipe out their pockets.

319
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,720
Anbu, don't let the crowd
scare you.

320
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,040
You just focus on your game.
I know you'll ace it.

321
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,840
'The reason Anbu plays
carom so well is Rajan.'

322
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
'It was Rajan who taught
Anbu to play carom.'

323
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,600
'To all the little boys and girls of
the hood, he was MGR, Rajini, everything.'

324
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,760
'They did whatever Rajan told them to do.'

325
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,040
Concentrate on it
Be patient and play slowly

326
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,960
'Rajan has built the 'Singaravelar
Memorial Club' for village people'

327
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,720
I have started this
club only for you

328
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,920
You can do all the smugglings

329
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,800
If police questioning you,
You can chase them away

330
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,240
Shouldn't think like that
you have to give up such ideas

331
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,880
Those who are willing to study,
can study well

332
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,480
Those who are not interested
in studies, can play carom board

333
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,120
Learn boxing, foot ball
and body building

334
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
If you do like that,
You can get posting in sports quota

335
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
Getting the posting
you can go abroad

336
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,080
Earn money, learn new things
and come back to your home

337
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,280
And improve your hometown

338
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,960
No one should come to improve
our town, we have to do the honors

339
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,800
'That's why we've started this club'

340
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,640
'Rajan told if someone plays caroms
his life would be flourish'

341
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
'So Anbu started to play
and still playing it till today'

342
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,400
I'm betting Rs 1000
on Anbu.

343
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,600
Foul! You're distracting my player.

344
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,880
I was feeling itchy, that's all.

345
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,960
Afraid?

346
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,400
Our player has won
more than 300 matches.

347
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,600
You've brought some child
and bet so much money on him.

348
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,520
- Let it be, Siva.
- He's cheating.

349
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,480
I'll just play.

350
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,680
Take that now!

351
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,960
Saw that?
He won fair and square!

352
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,320
Hello?

353
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,760
When?

354
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,880
- In Sriperumbudur?
- What happened?

355
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,800
Rajiv Gandhi has been assassinated.

356
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,760
Who is Rajiv Gandhi?

357
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,040
He was our prime minister!

358
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,160
Oh, after M.G.R?

359
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,840
- Rajiv Gandhi has been assassinated.
- Really?

360
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,280
There are riots everywhere.

361
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,160
Let's play again.

362
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,440
Okay. Party's over.
Everybody leave.

363
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,880
I've brought many of our players
to play in the den.

364
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,480
But you are very special, Anbu.

365
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,720
Your strokes are misleading
and your aim is sharp.

366
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,040
Don't change your style.
We can haul a grand every week.

367
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,920
Thambi won't like the fact that
I'm playing gambling matches.

368
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,000
He wants me to prepare
for the district selections.

369
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,160
What would Thambi know?

370
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,920
The practice you get here
will make you a national champion.

371
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,720
- Here's your share.
- No, thank you.

372
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,120
It's okay, take it.
- Take it.

373
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,560
Thanks, Siva.

374
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,480
They're having a field day!

375
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,640
This is an opportunity to ransack
properties of people you hate.

376
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,720
Logu, start ironing vehicles.
No use just pelting stones.

377
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,560
Keep them out,
I'll pull the shutter down!

378
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,040
The TV store owner
is done for.

379
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,120
Looks like the whole hood
hates him.

380
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,080
Anbu!

381
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,640
- Anbu!
- Stop bro

382
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,280
Come here... Hurry up!

383
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,400
That's my mother,
I must go.

384
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,560
What are you doing here?

385
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,720
We're struggling to break in.
You're just riding away?

386
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,000
I didn't know you were here!

387
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,080
He just seizes products if we miss
a single installment.

388
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,280
This is payback time!

389
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,360
That's a good plan. But too crowded
for payback, mom.

390
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,360
These are all our people.
Just go in!

391
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,360
Buddy, they've broken into
the liquor shop. Let's go there.

392
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,360
You go there if you wish!
Don't corrupt my son.

393
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,600
We're from the same hood, after-all.
Let me in, bro?

394
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,160
Don't you recognize me?

395
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,760
- Anbu, let's pick this big box.
- You witch! Get out.

396
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,280
How dare you push my mom?
Rascal!

397
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,000
Why did you hit him so bad?
I told you to stop!

398
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,200
He shoved you,
and you want me to do nothing?

399
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,160
Let go, man.

400
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,120
If you have the guts,
break into some shop...

401
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,000
You can't just steal from me, boy.

402
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,800
I warn you.
If you don't let go now...

403
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,520
"A hit-woman struck me;
She got this hit-man swooning."

404
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,200
Boy... you're a girl?

405
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
Are you stupid or what?

406
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,840
You missed my eyes,
my figure and my skirt?

407
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,000
Skirt?
- Let go!

408
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,400
I thought it was a Burmese lungi.

409
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,760
I said let go!

410
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,000
We worked so hard to take it,
and you just gave it away!

411
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,320
We have enough, mom.

412
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,280
I call dibs on that grinder.

413
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,560
I'll drop these home
and come back for it.

414
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,480
Your son is struggling
to carry the TV.

415
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,320
Go help him!

416
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,400
Like father like son.

417
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,320
Just wasted that sewing machine
over some chick.

418
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,960
- It would have been so useful...
- Would you let it go, mom?

419
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,280
We still have a grinder
and this big machine.

420
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,080
I even took a beating
to get that machine!

421
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,560
Give me that.

422
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,560
Vasanthi, you know Kaveri's son?

423
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,040
He broke into so many shops
to help her start a new life.

424
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,600
But this fool of a son...?

425
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,480
Do any of those crooks play
carom like your son?

426
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,120
What purpose does it serve?

427
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,360
- I'll get a government job.
- Your son is a gem.

428
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,320
Unable to cope with the tragedy,
you may have ransacked the shops...

429
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,320
Here, this is the money
I won playing carom.

430
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,320
I can even earn money
playing carom!

431
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,760
The shop owners won't file a case
if you return the goods.

432
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,000
But if you make us confiscate
them from your homes...

433
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,920
severe action will be taken
against all of you.

434
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,800
Hand over the goods,
and this ends here.

435
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Sir, they've assassinated Rajiv Gandhi!

436
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,680
He's such a great
leader of the country.

437
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,680
We're all mourning his death.

438
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,000
And you're asking us to
return some crap now?

439
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,240
Do we look like thieves to you?

440
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,320
Get home safe, sir.

441
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,520
Fix your badge.
It's hanging limp.

442
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,920
Keep an eye on that guy.

443
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
In some hoods, people broke into
jewellery shops.

444
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,480
Those utensils look new.
They belong to you?

445
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
Go outside the slums
and catch the real thieves.

446
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,160
Mom, we should give
them the machines.

447
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,920
We have nothing from them.
What can we give?

448
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,160
- They're already taken it all.
- Really? All of it?

449
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,120
We should have come with Thambi.
They won't go against his word.

450
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,320
Fine!

451
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,680
'Thambi.'

452
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,000
'Rajan's younger brother.'

453
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,960
'After Rajan, he is the most respected
person in the hood.'

454
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,400
Listen up, everyone.

455
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,800
I know that our people
broke into many shops last night.

456
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,920
All these shopkeepers are outsiders
who have immense faith in us.

457
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,800
It's our duty to help them,
and not steal from them.

458
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,360
I request you to return
the things you took from them.

459
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,960
Hameed, help me with this.

460
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,880
All that struggle for nothing?

461
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,760
You too, Anbu?

462
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,440
I'd have been an outcast
if I didn't...

463
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,560
Leave it there.

464
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,200
This boy hit me.
I want to file a case against him.

465
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,720
Let me speak to him.

466
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,360
Anbu, let me keep
this one machine.

467
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,600
Let go, Mom!
Do you even know what this does?

468
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,760
- Tell me and you can keep it.
- I don't care.

469
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,840
 What will you do with it?

470
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,040
I toil in the summers
lugging pots of water.

471
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,040
It's got a huge drum.
I'll store water in it.

472
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,200
- Come on, mom.
- Anbu, stop it!

473
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,000
Let go, mom!

474
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,400
You've got everything?

475
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,640
I'm happy with whatever
we've recovered so far.

476
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,040
Inspector, I'll take leave.

477
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,040
Okay.

478
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,160
Go, give it back to them.

479
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,160
Ask Anbu to come
and see me.

480
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,760
Why would he call you alone?

481
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,600
No idea.

482
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,440
We didn't even make any trouble
at the gambling den.

483
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,560
We were the first
to return the goods, too.

484
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,680
Then why would he want to see me?

485
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,760
You wanted to meet me?

486
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,360
- Kala, come here.
- Yes, dad?

487
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,880
- Ask your mom to make a garland.
- Okay, dad.

488
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,040
Anbu, the shop owner wants to
file a complaint against you.

489
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,320
Why him?

490
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,280
It seems you didn't return
some sewing machine?

491
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,080
Really?

492
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,920
Everyone else stole
very expensive machines.

493
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,480
He wants to file a case
for a sewing machine?

494
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,600
It's not about
the sewing machine.

495
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,080
I broke his nose last night.
The machine is just an excuse.

496
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,240
So apologise to him
and solve the issue.

497
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,920
Then let him come and ask
for my mother's forgiveness.

498
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,840
What?

499
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,480
He shoved my mom first.

500
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,600
I punched him in defense.

501
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,840
That's the right thing to do.

502
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,600
If he hadn't shoved my mother,
why would I hit him?

503
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,360
The district championships
start next week.

504
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,120
I don't want you to get embroiled
in some case and sabotage your career.

505
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,920
I'll just return
the machine to him.

506
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,880
Fine.

507
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,120
Siva!

508
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,040
Yes, Thambi?

509
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,360
- Talk some sense into this boy.
- I will.

510
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,280
Don't want him in any trouble.

511
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,400
What's that shop owner's problem?

512
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,840
He is threatening to take legal action
if I don't return that machine.

513
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,440
Anbu, I know the shop owner very well.
He'll not let you go easily.

514
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480
There's no way for you
to escape the prison.

515
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,800
Make a choice. Do you want to
go to prison for a petty theft...

516
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,240
or take this dagger, stab him,
and go to prison like a real man?

517
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,200
No thanks, Sankar.
I'll talk to him and sort it out.

518
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,000
That's upto you.

519
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,480
But remember, I always have
two daggers hidden in my motorcycle.

520
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,400
Feel free to use it
for a good cause.

521
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,880
Don't misguide him, Sankar.

522
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,080
Just talk it out.

523
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,480
Let me know if you need my help.

524
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,480
Thank you, Siva.

525
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,160
Take this.

526
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,040
If we see from here
somehow we can catch her

527
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,120
You can see it all from up here:

528
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,080
The sea, the ships,
the village, the housing.

529
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,480
This is a great vantage point!

530
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,480
But how will you spot a girl
you've never seen before?

531
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,080
- Who said I didn't see her?
- You did!

532
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,600
I said I didn't see her face.

533
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,240
That's the house.
They're drying the same blanket.

534
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,120
But I'm not sure
if that's the girl...

535
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,040
"With joyful laughter"

536
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,160
- That's the girl, buddy.
- How can you be sure?

537
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,360
When I grabbed her shirt,
her button popped...

538
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,880
Let me see.
Give it to me.

539
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,320
"She sent the kite
with her sharp eyes"

540
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,160
Can you see
anything from here?

541
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,400
No.

542
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,240
- Just making sure.
- I'd love to see, though.

543
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,720
Let me handle this alone.

544
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
I want to see just once...

545
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,600
No way!

546
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,160
Doesn't your father work
at that pawn shop?

547
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,560
Give us back that machine
or I'll go ask your father.

548
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
I don't know what
you're talking about.

549
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,200
Please don't harass me
in my hood.

550
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,960
My father won't let me go to school
if he finds me talking to strangers.

551
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,040
She sounds so innocent.
Are you sure she's the girl?

552
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,200
She's pinned her shirt
where I pulled off the button.

553
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,160
I noticed that.

554
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,640
Ask her, man.
We need that machine.

555
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,200
Girl! If you're so scared,
give us back the sewing machine.

556
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,200
And we'll leave you alone.

557
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,480
I don't know what
you're talking about.

558
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,960
Please don't follow me.

559
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,760
This won't work out.

560
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,960
We need to create a scene.

561
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,800
Don't do that.
Poor thing!

562
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,040
Hop on, and let me handle this.

563
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,760
I'll make her dance to my tune.

564
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,080
Listen, girl. You just need to answer
our questions and we won't hurt you.

565
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,720
Don't run away from us.

566
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,520
What did you say, boy?
I'm running away?

567
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,760
Stupid oaf.

568
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,960
- Leave before I abuse you.
- Too late for that.

569
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,760
Let's go, buddy.
She's got a dirty mouth.

570
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,360
You know that sewing machine
you took from me last night...?

571
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
You saw me taking it?

572
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,600
Why else would I ask you?

573
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,000
Did you see my face?

574
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,600
I saw...

575
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,160
Just return that sewing machine.
Or there will be trouble.

576
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,080
Look, I've been trying
not to lose my cool in my hood.

577
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,320
But I'm beginning to lose my calm.

578
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,720
Keep at it
and I'll smash your face in!

579
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,480
- Padma, is there a problem?
- Not at all.

580
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,600
No, just a bunch of kids.
I'll handle it.

581
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,520
She's nasty when she's calm.

582
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,680
Go to prison rather than
deal with her when she's pissed.

583
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,280
- Listen to me, buddy.
- What did you say?

584
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,200
I said you wouldn't have
taken the machine, ma'am.

585
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,520
Now he gets it.

586
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,960
You should learn from him.

587
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,840
Look, your empty threats
don't scare me.

588
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,680
The shopkeeper is threatening to
file a case against me.

589
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,760
I won't be going to prison for petty theft.
I'd rather go for murder.

590
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,960
Hope you get what I mean.

591
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,760
Boohoo! I'm scared.

592
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,720
Get lost, despo.

593
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,040
I found the girl
who took that machine.

594
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,000
Just tell her to give it back.

595
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,880
I tried.
But she won't give it back.

596
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,400
She won't give it back?
Why?

597
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,200
No idea!
Maybe she really needs it.

598
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,360
When you stand in front of a girl,
she must be terrified.

599
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,880
You need to man up.

600
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,720
I don't know all that.
Please help me out.

601
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,200
- Let's go, Sankar.
- Sure.

602
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,160
It is our responsibility
to help our boys out.

603
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
- Please help me out.
- I can't do this every time...

604
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,720
Just watch how I deal
with her and learn from it.

605
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,120
My dad did tell me
that it would be a holiday...

606
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,320
- Who is it?
- That's the girl.

607
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,240
Which one?

608
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,360
The white shirt.

609
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,680
Oh no!
That girl?

610
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
Okay, do as I said
and get it from her.

611
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,200
But she's scolding us.

612
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,640
Then you must not irritate her.

613
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,720
She's a lady.
You need to not be irritating.

614
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,000
They don't know about your
One-Sided Love Affair!

615
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,400
Let's go.
Remember to man up!

616
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,120
Please get it for me.

617
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,800
Anbu, her father works at the pawn shop
in the 2nd Street.

618
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,280
Talk to him.

619
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,440
I know that man.

620
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,320
Siva... the sooner you ask
that girl out, the better.

621
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,680
What are you doing here?

622
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,920
Did I talk to you?
We're just standing here.

623
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,880
Should have just
slaughtered you right there.

624
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,120
Cheats... Here to steal something else?

625
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,560
You stole that machine.
Don't act all righteous.

626
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,360
Calm down!
We're enquiring.

627
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,360
Give me a list.

628
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,240
130 sovereigns of gold,
2 kg silver...

629
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,440
40 pawned watches...

630
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,120
and about 8 grand
in the cash register.

631
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,600
So crowd!

632
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
I said, wait!

633
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,000
Why are you here, Chandra?

634
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,480
I had deposited in the chit fund.

635
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,960
And pledged some jewellery, too.

636
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,480
So I came to check...

637
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,000
I'll check and
send word home.

638
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,640
The man in the white shirt?

639
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,000
That's her father.

640
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,080
Let's go talk to him.

641
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,400
How can we talk to him now?

642
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,240
He must be under so much pressure.

643
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,640
There's a mob outside his shop.

644
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,200
If we accuse his daughter of stealing,
think about her future...

645
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,040
Why don't you go
back to your parents?

646
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,200
You're struggling all alone.

647
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,560
I have nobody.

648
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
And I have unfinished business here.

649
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,720
I really need this money.

650
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,760
I'll collect whatever they
owe you and send it across.

651
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,720
Just take your money
and go somewhere.

652
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,480
You've become a good boy
when you grabbed her shirt, isn't it?

653
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,720
Chandra...

654
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,080
You remember that boy?

655
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,160
He's Manimegalai's son,
from our hood.

656
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,240
That death...

657
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,880
He is the chosen one.

658
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,800
Somehow its united both
Chandra and Anbu's life

659
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,400
He shall come to you one day,
bearing good news.

660
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,400
Is it in working condition?

661
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,160
No, sir.

662
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,560
Check the next one.

663
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,200
Careful.

664
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,160
Hello.

665
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,120
You dare to enter my shop
after hitting me?

666
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,080
I only hit you because
you hit my mother.

667
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,000
You people broke into his shop.
Expect us to stand by and watch?

668
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,960
That's because you
over-price the products...

669
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,120
and repossess them
if our installment is not paid.

670
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,320
How is that fair?

671
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,960
Anyway.
You're pissed that I hit you.

672
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,160
I punched you twice.

673
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,960
You can punch me four times.
Just don't file a case.

674
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,480
Match won by Sathish Kumar.

675
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,320
Let's get out of here.

676
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,440
What was that?

677
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,960
I hurt my thumb...

678
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,480
so I couldn't play well.

679
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,680
The shopkeeper hurt you?

680
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,640
It's easy to lose your way
in hoods like ours.

681
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,280
Carrying weapons and picking fights
may look cool...

682
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,200
Come on!

683
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,480
You know I'd never...

684
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,680
I'm worried for you, Anbu.

685
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,120
You are gifted with the game.

686
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,440
Work on that and train
the next batch of kids.

687
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Next year I'll make it, I promise.

688
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,840
But you've lost a year.

689
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,760
Buck up.

690
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,200
That sewing machine belonged
to this woman...

691
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,720
she needed it
to feed her family.

692
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,520
She didn't pay--

693
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,200
I know all about that.

694
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,320
I heard you got beaten?

695
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,120
Yes, I was beaten.

696
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
He broke my thumb.

697
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,640
I couldn't play.
I lost the game.

698
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,640
I lost a year!

699
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,080
I know you did it for a reason.
So I let it go.

700
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,480
Now will you stop
rubbing it in?

701
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,000
Get going.
I'm getting annoyed.

702
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,240
Padma...

703
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,920
In any case...

704
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,840
your coming here
and checking on me...

705
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,840
I like that 'feel'.

706
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
I'll take you out tomorrow.
Will you come?

707
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,040
Why are we going
all the way to the top?

708
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,200
I'll tell you in a minute.

709
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,000
Climb.

710
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,760
Meeting Padma and Anbu together
is another reason for Anbu to go to jail

711
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,920
What?

712
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,480
You go first.

713
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,360
Why are you reluctant?

714
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
I'll keep an eye,
don't worry.

715
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,160
That's why I'm worried.

716
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
You climb first.

717
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,320
- Come on!
- Climb.

718
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,720
Let's climb together, then.

719
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,480
"Pretty girl, standing on the balcony."

720
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,000
This is nice, too.

721
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,800
'Come on top, I'll show you...
Around town.'

722
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,520
Come on.

723
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,440
Don't be afraid.
Come on!

724
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,440
You acted all tough in your hood...

725
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,000
But you're terrified now?

726
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,840
Just sit here.

727
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,320
See our hood there?

728
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
What the hell?

729
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,320
It was just a kiss.

730
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,120
That's what lovers do.

731
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,280
Who said we're lovers?

732
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,200
Then let's go.
No point being here!

733
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,640
So it's okay for you to kiss?

734
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,120
That's what lovers do!

735
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,680
We're teachers' training students.

736
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,200
I have a dull child at home.

737
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,840
He's useless. Keeps playing carom,
eats and sleeps.

738
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,560
He's failed his 12th
exams five times.

739
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,480
Will you teach him maths?

740
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,640
Not just maths.
I'll teach him everything.

741
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,600
"Stood in front of me, my dear deer"

742
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,800
What are you doing?
My mother will be back any minute.

743
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,920
Your mother sent me here
to teach you.

744
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,680
Is it?
Teach me what?

745
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,960
Here she comes.

746
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
Good morning, sir.

747
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,520
Who blocks the way
to greet someone?

748
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,880
I was excited seeing you.

749
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,000
Why the hell are you excited
to see me?

750
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,080
Sir, don't you remember me?

751
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,720
I came to your shop
the other day...

752
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,240
Now I remember.

753
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,680
You came with Kumaraswamy, eh?

754
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,080
Mom is at the hospital,
and you're making small talk here?

755
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,800
Let's go!

756
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,160
Trying to teach me?

757
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,280
Tit for tat!

758
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,560
Move aside...

759
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,240
What?

760
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,760
Hello, sir.

761
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,680
Are you stalking that girl?

762
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,880
We're related, sir.

763
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,760
Meaning?

764
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,600
We're family.

765
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,240
If she's family,
meet her at home.

766
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,720
Not here on the roads.

767
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,560
She's not close family yet, sir...

768
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,320
What's this?
Looks like a chicken's ass!

769
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,240
It's called funk, sir.

770
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,040
Bunk?

771
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,320
No... Funk! With an 'F'.
Funk!

772
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,280
Sir, you have a problem
with his hair?

773
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,000
You should go after dope dealers
and drug peddlers instead.

774
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,120
- Are you his friend?
- Yes.

775
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,320
Come join the party.

776
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,960
Only these many boys in town
have long hair?

777
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,080
They scattered away
upon hearing the police siren.

778
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,760
It was a struggle to round them up.

779
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,240
I am growing my hair
in prayer to the gods.

780
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,720
They all say the same thing.

781
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,000
None of you look like the religious type.

782
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,760
- Sir, I work for Guna.
- Leave.

783
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,120
- Remember, we met at Senthil's...?
- Okay, go.

784
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,360
We need to be part of gangs
even to grow our hair out?

785
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,000
Why do you need two belts
to hold your pants?

786
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,080
It's in style, sir.

787
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,320
Cut off his hair first.

788
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,360
Sir, I've taken a vow.
This is sacrilege!

789
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,640
Shut up, or I'll ask him
to cut your ears off!

790
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,240
Step back, ladies!

791
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,960
Think you're special?
Stand in line.

792
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,360
But I left my pot here.

793
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,760
Think everyone else standing in line
is stupid or what?

794
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,560
That's what we do every day.
Who are you?

795
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,200
I'm having none of that!
Get going.

796
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,840
What's the matter, mom?
I'll fetch the water.

797
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,240
Your mom?

798
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,120
Must you offend
all my family members?

799
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,680
I had no clue
she was your mother!

800
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,120
You look nicer
with this haircut.

801
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,600
I know.
I cut it for you.

802
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,840
Hey, Padma!

803
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,480
Come out!

804
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,920
Whose motorcycle is it?

805
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,480
What do you care?
Come.

806
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,400
My dad is in the hospital.

807
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Go.
I'll come.

808
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,080
I want a yellow chart,
and that pen.

809
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,640
What are you doing here?

810
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,240
I came to get you
a 'Happy birthday' card.

811
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,040
Pretend like you don't know me!
Give me that chart.

812
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,800
Let's go.

813
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,120
How dare you touch her?

814
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,560
This is my little brother.

815
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,480
Oh, that's what you were whispering?
How are you, kid?

816
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,720
Be good, boy.
Goodbye.

817
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,880
Kids grow so fast these days!

818
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,520
Why do you talk
to these crooks?

819
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,080
Kannan, don't speak about him that way.

820
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,160
If I were to marry him,
he'd be your brother-in-law.

821
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,520
Him? My brother-in-law?

822
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,120
If you can't do better than him,
just stay unmarried.

823
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,480
"He is the chariot to Amman temple"

824
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,480
She's here!

825
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,000
- I'll be right back.
- There he goes!

826
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,360
"She is a fish from Kasimedu"

827
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,680
"Straightforward girl"

828
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,400
"He flirts her to have a feast"

829
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,800
My father is here.

830
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,600
"She made me flat for her
And took away my heart"

831
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,680
"He went in the night
to flirt her in the electricity light"

832
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,480
We'll try the yellow bangles.

833
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,600
"With white color striker, he
made the black coin fall into the net"

834
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,480
Catch him

835
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,160
Let me go!

836
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,280
Who are you?
Who sent you?

837
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,920
Senthil!
Senthil sent me to kill you.

838
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,080
He is here.

839
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,560
At least now will you make sure
I pass my exams?

840
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,120
- Hello, Siva.
- Anbu, you're here?

841
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,680
We have an important
meeting here.

842
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,120
Take that table outside.

843
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,600
Padma has passed her exams.
So we're having a little party.

844
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,600
You can party outside, too.
This meeting is really important!

845
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,560
How about we
finish eating--?

846
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,800
Get up now.
Get the hell out!

847
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,640
I'm telling you it's important!

848
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,640
What exam did she pass?

849
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,160
Teacher's Training exams.

850
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,120
Anbu, don't pay for anything.
I'll foot your bill.

851
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,720
No, thank you.
I have money.

852
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,480
In here.

853
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,080
This table is just as good!
Eat up.

854
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,480
I forgot my handbag
in there.

855
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,960
Come on!
Why would you?

856
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,880
Guna, someone tried to kill you,
and gave Senthil's name.

857
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,840
Which means you have
a common enemy.

858
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,680
It's about time you two
buried the hatchet.

859
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,520
You don't need to be friends.
But you need to make peace.

860
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,160
Okay?

861
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,280
Under the new trade laws,
imported goods can be bought in stores.

862
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,120
That's true.

863
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,800
We risked our lives to smuggle these goods,
and now you can just buy them anywhere!

864
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,360
I smuggled foreign goods
and electronics all these years...

865
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,480
I'll switch to cocaine now.

866
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,360
All these years...

867
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,200
we supplied products that people needed,
but couldn't buy legally.

868
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,760
That's why the police
and politicians turned a blind eye.

869
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,920
But drugs is not something
that the people need.

870
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,120
If we make money off that,
the cops would show up with their guns.

871
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,520
I don't want to die with them.

872
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,440
- Can you...
- I can't go in now.

873
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,240
Senthil, Viji told me what
your plan is...

874
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,760
'After Thambi brokered peace
between Guna and Senthil...'

875
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,840
'everyone believed there'd be
no more gang wars between them.'

876
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,720
'No one imagined the gang war
would start again because of Anbu..'

877
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,200
'or that Anbu would end up in prison
because of it.'

878
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,680
This is the second time you've come
to the hospital in two days.

879
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,720
I don't know what the deal is
with you and Siva.

880
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,800
But Velu, Guna, and the others
are baying for your blood.

881
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,000
You only have
one way out now.

882
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,960
Do whatever it takes
and go to Senthil's block.

883
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,120
- Boy...
- Sir?

884
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,080
Fool, why did you
give us that phone?

885
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,280
If we hadn't gotten there in time,
they would have killed you.

886
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,480
They'll come after you now.
Stay away from them.

887
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,840
Stay in Quarantine Block,
I'll get you transferred to another prison.

888
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,240
My mom lives close by.

889
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,080
This would be convenient
for her to visit.

890
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,960
Let me be here, sir.

891
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,960
Can you read?

892
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,400
I can read and write in Tamil.

893
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,280
Work in the Memo Department.

894
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,360
Take this.
Go.

895
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,560
- You're the new boy the Jailer sent?
- Yes, sir.

896
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,200
Read the inmate's name,
then father's name. Loud and clear.

897
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,440
Mohammed Gani, son of Qadar.

898
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,720
Father's name?
- Qadar.

899
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,560
If we use it all now,
what about tonight?

900
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,200
There's a dry spell everywhere,
and you're smoking up secretly?

901
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,080
Give me a drag.

902
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,840
We're trying to get high
scraping seeds and twigs we can...

903
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,160
we have nothing to spare!

904
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,160
Just buzz off!

905
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,520
Don't mind him.
Just light it up, man.

906
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,560
I just want a drag,
don't attack me!

907
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,560
I only asked for a drag,
but they slashed my face.

908
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,680
We were trying to make do
with whatever we could find...

909
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,560
why would we give it to him?

910
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,440
"If you disappear
I am not to blame"

911
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,160
"Will become as sharp as a knife"

912
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,680
Come here!

913
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,280
I said, come here!

914
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,160
Siva, let it go.

915
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,560
"Some moron stared at me"

916
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,200
Smuggle it in.

917
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,960
Just get our guy there.
I'll take care of it!

918
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,880
Gopi, son of Ramasamy.

919
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Coming.

920
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,960
Karthi, son of Ganesan.

921
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,440
Prasad, son of Sathyanarayanan.

922
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,640
- Gopi? What's your father's name?
- Ramasamy.

923
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,000
Karthi?
What's your father's name?

924
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
Ganesan.

925
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,000
They've tightened
the checks.

926
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,640
Is there a memo for Moses?

927
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,520
What are you looking at?

928
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,640
- Huh?
- Raju is my friend.

929
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,320
- Raju?
- I wanted to speak to him.

930
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,720
Speak to him?
Why are you here?

931
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,400
- I'm reading the bail list.
- You need not.

932
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,360
You read it, man.

933
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,440
I know it

934
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
Dass, what's up?

935
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
It's nothing.

936
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
- Just the Memo guy.
- Send him away!

937
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,080
You can meet Raju
at the Quarantine or the court.

938
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,320
You can't meet Raju here.

939
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,280
Get going.

940
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,360
- The ball...
- Buzz off.

941
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,720
"He just threw the net"

942
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,960
"And caught an innocent worm"

943
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,760
"Executed the plan and made it success"

944
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,200
"Became an enemy to somebody"

945
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,760
"He just threw the net"

946
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,920
"And caught an innocent worm"

947
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,480
"Executed the plan and made it success"

948
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,920
"Became an enemy to somebody"

949
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,200
Hello, sir.

950
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,080
 Are you feeling alright now?
How are things?

951
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,240
- Someone's come to meet you?
- No, I want to change my block...

952
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,000
Oh, right.
He is the man.

953
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,040
- Dass...
- Yes?

954
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,280
- He's the guy who saved me from Siva.
- Oh, this guy?

955
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,960
He's played carom
at state level.

956
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,640
The boss would enjoy playing with him.

957
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,320
Fine! Have him come to
our block.

958
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,160
I'm betting on boss.
Four beedies.

959
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,520
I'm betting two.

960
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,360
Somebody bet on him, too.

961
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,280
I'll bet on him.

962
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,120
He missed on purpose.

963
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,560
I won two!

964
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,000
Whoever bet on him
gets the beedies.

965
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,040
He won the game, really.

966
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,120
You play well.

967
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,880
Let's play some other time.
I'll send word.

968
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,480
I am the richest person in the jail

969
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,760
Nothing to worry about, sir.

970
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,000
You're perfectly alright.

971
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,480
Just find a reason to send me
to the hospital

972
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,760
Sir, what is it you need?

973
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,200
Senthil will make it happen.

974
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,600
I've known him since his
half-trouser days.

975
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,680
It was I who gave him
his first weapon.

976
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,760
He asked for my help
to finish Rajan.

977
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,600
Then he worked against me
and swapped parties for money.

978
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,560
I can't trust him.

979
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,720
It's not like that.

980
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,240
Senthil is a very humble man.

981
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,640
Since you got here, he's constantly been
asking me to setup a meeting.

982
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,560
He is the reason I'm in here.

983
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,840
If I'd won the elections,
I wouldn't be an opposition whip.

984
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,480
He sells cocaine worth five lakhs a day
from inside the prison.

985
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,440
He gets no support from your people.

986
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,920
Now that you're here,
you could put in a word...

987
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,120
and have someone from the Centre
speak to the Superintendent...

988
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,280
he says we can double his profits.

989
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,600
Yes?

990
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,200
You wanted to see me?

991
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,160
I want to come back
to the party.

992
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,080
You realise that my party
will come to power next elections?

993
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,400
You captured 16 booths in my legislature
and cast votes for my opponent.

994
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,920
You're the reason I lost.

995
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,240
Now you want my help?

996
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,320
I want to belong to a party
where my work gets recognition.

997
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,280
That's why I've come to you.

998
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,280
You betrayed me for money.

999
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,680
Guna is not like that.

1000
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,840
He's stood by me all these years.

1001
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,520
Should I leave him for you?

1002
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,200
I'm not asking for a posting.

1003
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,320
Take me in the party.
Let me work.

1004
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,520
Then you can decide.

1005
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,280
I don't need to tell you this...

1006
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,440
I control 3 of the 7 unions
at the harbour.

1007
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,200
I have 500 young men at my disposal,
ready to follow any command.

1008
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,480
You say the number, and I will
arrange for the funds.

1009
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,520
Five crores?

1010
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,600
I'll do ten crores.

1011
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,000
Anbu, button up
and cover those bruises.

1012
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,920
If the judge asks, you must tell him
that it didn't happen in prison.

1013
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,080
Yeah. He must say he slipped and fell.

1014
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,360
Keep an eye on Raju.

1015
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,360
He will divert us with
jokes and load 'Pepsi' up his butt.

1016
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,400
Why did you bring the child here?

1017
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,240
I've found you a new lawyer, dear.
I'll bail you out.

1018
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,320
I'm telling you, I don't want a bail.
I must work hard and make money here.

1019
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,480
Wake him up!

1020
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,400
He's fast asleep.

1021
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,760
 How can he come all the way
and not see his dad?

1022
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,960
That's my son.
Isn't he cute?

1023
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,080
I must find a good school
for him next year.

1024
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,200
See you then.

1025
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,760
So I'm working hard to save for it.

1026
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,200
No one has smuggled in
so much 'Pepsi', ever.

1027
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,840
I'm ready to do that.

1028
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,720
Anbu, that guy in the brown shirt...

1029
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,000
he's got the goods.

1030
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,320
Help me get it from him,
I'll get you in our block.

1031
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:31,600
"This gangster life - It's kind of swell;
A tranquil life - Is rather dull."

1032
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,560
"Kick that door open, take what you want;
Work like a dog, till you clear your debt."

1033
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,960
'No excuses when you're well and able;
No debts or accounts, you must settle.'

1034
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,320
'Bottle' Mani, Murugesan.

1035
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,480
Greetings, sir

1036
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,400
- What's your father's name?
- Paramasivan.

1037
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,360
Case adjourned to 18.08.2000

1038
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,720
"Executed the plan and made it success"

1039
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,760
Ravi.

1040
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,840
- Father's name?
- Sonu.

1041
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,360
18.08.2000

1042
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,440
"And caught an innocent worm"

1043
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,040
Siva, Anbu!

1044
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,680
What's your father's name?

1045
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,600
Manickam.

1046
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,720
Greetings.

1047
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,360
Siva.
Father's name?

1048
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,160
Shanmugam.

1049
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,800
Case adjourned to 18.08.2000.

1050
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,920
"Cross all the hurdles
Name and fame will come to you"

1051
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,120
Anbu, be ready.

1052
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,480
Why do you keep lagging behind?
Can't keep up?

1053
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,120
You walk properly.
Why do you keep tugging at the chain?

1054
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,640
I told you not to handcuff me
with people like him!

1055
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,520
Look for anyone walking
with their legs apart.

1056
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,560
He's the usual mule.

1057
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,400
Come here!
Aren't you the King Mule?

1058
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,600
You, come this way.

1059
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,440
- Keep walking.
- That guy!

1060
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,160
You, get in.

1061
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,800
I made a promise
to the boss.

1062
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,040
A couple of sim cards
would have done it!

1063
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,280
They seized everything.

1064
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,760
How will I face my boss now?

1065
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,840
What?

1066
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,680
Give me your slippers
and wear mine.

1067
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,640
What?

1068
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,560
Give me your slippers
and wear mine.

1069
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,200
You think this is funny?

1070
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,400
These are nice slippers, right?

1071
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,040
Yes

1072
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,480
Why don't you wear them?

1073
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,000
Lock it properly.

1074
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,240
Boss!

1075
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,480
Come in.
The boss wanted to see you.

1076
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
The Superintendent isn't allowing anything!

1077
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,600
He can only stop the goods
coming in through the gates...

1078
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,440
he can do nothing about the lizards
that come in through the windows!

1079
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,080
- Getting high on lizard tails?
- Yes, come join us.

1080
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,120
Don't kill each other,
that's a dangerous high.

1081
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,600
- We can handle the high!
- You guys are a pain.

1082
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,200
Go on!

1083
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,600
Boss, this is the guy.

1084
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,440
All our experienced
mules have failed.

1085
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,320
How did you manage?

1086
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,280
I was working in
the Memo Department.

1087
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,520
I noticed that
they don't check the slippers.

1088
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,440
So I asked my brother-in-law
to pack it in these sandals.

1089
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,920
You can make a lot of money
if you sell on your own.

1090
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,120
Why give it to me?

1091
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,400
I need your protection, boss.

1092
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,320
They said Senthil's block is the safest
for those afraid of Guna.

1093
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,120
I took this risk
just to bring it to you.

1094
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,920
When they tried to kill Raju
at Quarantine...

1095
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,800
he was the one
who foiled their plans.

1096
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,400
Siva is waiting for the right time
to finish him off.

1097
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,040
He is running scared from them.

1098
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,920
- Where are you from?
- Nagoorar Thottam.

1099
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,400
I ran a check.

1100
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,160
Remember Manickam from your hood?
His son.

1101
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,520
- Find him a spot in our block.
- Okay, boss.

1102
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,800
You can stay here.

1103
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,320
Thank you, boss.

1104
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,840
- Anbu...
- Boss?

1105
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,720
If you live in this block,
it means you're one of my men.

1106
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,560
No one would dare to touch
one of my men.

1107
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,520
Be brave, you're safe now.

1108
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,880
Thanks.

1109
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,360
"Get set to crawl, if you can't walk.
If you see a prey, charge like a hawk."

1110
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,600
"Take in all the pain, like a penance;
If you lose yourself, rise from the ashes."

1111
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,440
ANBU - PADMA - PAZHANI

1112
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,960
One of our own boys, Anbu,
has made us all proud...

1113
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,240
by winning the district level
carom championships.

1114
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,240
All his expenses to take part in
National selections at Bombay...

1115
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,880
will be sponsored by our
Hon. Minister for Fisheries, Mr. Rosoriah.

1116
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,320
'Anbu was confident of winning a national
tournament and getting a Government job.'

1117
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,440
'But every time he came close
to getting a job...'

1118
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,920
'...he was confronted by a hurdle.'

1119
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,240
I want to lean back.
- Come over here...

1120
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,480
I'll make sure you get a good view.

1121
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,000
Sit here.

1122
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,160
- Can you see properly?
- No, I can't.

1123
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,680
You should sit next to
your sister!

1124
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,160
Come over here.

1125
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,720
Here he comes.

1126
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,080
Think he'll lift you by the waist?
Move it.

1127
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,800
Come on, boy.
Let's just watch the movie.

1128
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,760
What is the solution for this?

1129
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,080
Say something

1130
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,800
I'm a Complan boy

1131
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,080
You stay here.
They're here for me.

1132
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,840
I'm coming.

1133
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,040
I'm off to Bombay next week,
and you're busy watching the movie?

1134
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,280
What do you expect me to do?

1135
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,040
So you're here to actually
watch the movie?

1136
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,920
I'm not here for that.

1137
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,720
Take your hand off.

1138
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,560
I said, take your hand off!

1139
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,280
Feel free to push it away.

1140
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,720
Don't look back.
Just watch TV!

1141
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,600
That's how you push it away?

1142
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,000
Why did you act so pricey?

1143
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,480
I never did.

1144
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,240
Oh really?

1145
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,800
It's for us

1146
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,520
For us...?

1147
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,720
Us?

1148
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,000
Then...

1149
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,000
We got married 3 months ago
Why should we delay our wedding night?

1150
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,200
What is this?

1151
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:04,840
What's wrong?

1152
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,440
You're doing disgusting things
inside my home?

1153
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,480
Bro, what did you do?

1154
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,440
Get out of my house!
No more TV.

1155
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,680
Go ahead, buddy.
I'll see you later.

1156
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,760
Take care, buddy.

1157
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,480
What?

1158
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,640
Now everyone will call me a slut.

1159
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,480
Come on!

1160
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,080
No one saw anything, silly!

1161
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,000
- Anbu, come here.
- Give me a minute.

1162
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,400
That was disgusting.

1163
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,440
What?

1164
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,400
I let you walk around in our hood,
and you do this?

1165
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,280
Because of you, that girl's
reputation is ruined.

1166
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,960
Don't roam around with that girl
in the hood anymore.

1167
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,880
Go.

1168
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,240
You loved her past 8 years

1169
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,280
What can I do?

1170
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,160
Girls prefer boys like him.

1171
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,120
But girls didn't like sincere love, like me

1172
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,280
 Come on, let's go.

1173
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,240
As long as she is happy.

1174
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,920
He saw, didn't he?

1175
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,960
He asked me to play a bet-match
but I turned him down.

1176
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,080
 Let's go.

1177
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,720
What?

1178
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,880
I promise, he didn't see.

1179
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,200
I know he saw us.

1180
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,080
How could anyone see?
We moved apart when the lights came on.

1181
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,880
Don't be so childish!
Come on, it's alright...

1182
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,000
- Won't you believe me?
- I told you not to...

1183
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,520
When did you say that?

1184
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,720
Padma...

1185
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,200
Look at me, Padma...

1186
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:22,840
Leave me

1187
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,480
Listen. Please don't cry!

1188
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,920
Okay, I'll walk ahead.

1189
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,040
- He almost chewed her lips off.
- You missed it!

1190
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,760
That girl?
With this guy?

1191
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,880
Yes!

1192
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,880
You haven't come to see me
in two days.

1193
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,480
You're always taking your mother
everywhere you go.

1194
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,040
Why did you come here?

1195
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,440
Because you didn't
come to see me.

1196
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,560
Could I possibly step out alone
after what you've done?

1197
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,240
They make fun of me
wherever I go.

1198
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,160
At the fish market...

1199
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,680
This looks off.

1200
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,320
You're trying to sell me this?

1201
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,240
Anbu!

1202
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,560
How's the groping going, Anbu?

1203
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,000
Anbu!

1204
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,800
Remember my student, Gomathi?

1205
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,920
Why didn't you turn up
for tuition classes?

1206
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,240
You are kissing boys
while watching TV.

1207
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,640
My mother said we'll learn kissing
if we come to your tuitions.

1208
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,040
So she asked me not to come.

1209
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:06,920
Go.

1210
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,800
Half the girls
stopped attending my classes.

1211
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,080
And that lady Shanthi
complained to my mother, too.

1212
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,520
We both kissed each other.
It felt nice then?

1213
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,120
Now that there's trouble,
I'm the bad guy?

1214
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,040
I came to know about that lady's house
through you!

1215
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,880
I have a TV at home now
but I come there only for you.

1216
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,360
I was embarrassed, too.

1217
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,040
Situations like these only make boys
look like heroes.

1218
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,160
But it's humiliating for us.

1219
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,240
Yesterday, one guy asked me

1220
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,480
Okay, lets submit tomorrow

1221
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,160
Hey, Padma...

1222
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,040
Heard you're watching movies
with wimpy boys?

1223
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,200
What do you care?

1224
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,040
Come watch one with us?
We'll show you big movies!

1225
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,320
Ignore him. Let's go.

1226
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,520
It's got a lot of kissing.
Are you okay with it?

1227
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,240
Who was it?

1228
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,480
The guy who roams around
in that red motorcycle.

1229
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah. He's called 'Jawa' Pazhani.

1230
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,240
That's the guy.

1231
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,320
Sister?

1232
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,520
What happened?
Why are you crying?

1233
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,760
It's nothing. Get home now.
Why are you out?

1234
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,000
Tell me what happened?

1235
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,360
Kannan, they're ragging her.

1236
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,560
When Kannan confronted him,
he beat up Kannan.

1237
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,920
Let a man pee peacefully, will you?

1238
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,840
Wait!

1239
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,720
You're the kisser
from Shanthi's house!

1240
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,840
You made fun of my girlfriend.

1241
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,520
And you hit
my brother-in-law, too.

1242
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,440
Boy, when a big guy hits you,
keep it to yourself.

1243
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,640
You must not talk about it.

1244
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,440
I don't want to be known
for hitting children!

1245
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,480
Won't my friends think less
of me?

1246
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,560
I was happily stoned.
I just hit you for fun.

1247
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,200
You should take it easy
and forget about it, too.

1248
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,280
Okay?

1249
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,160
Don't go around telling people.

1250
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,000
Leave.

1251
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,080
Get going.

1252
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,280
She is a bombshell.
I can hardly believe it.

1253
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,240
Well done, boy.

1254
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,440
See you.

1255
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,400
What you did was wrong.

1256
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,680
You shouldn't have asked her
out that way...

1257
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,320
nor should you have
hit him.

1258
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,040
So?

1259
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,680
Don't do that anymore.

1260
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,640
I'm trying to be nice to you...

1261
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,240
Pazhani, all okay?

1262
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,160
Oh, I'm just having fun.

1263
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,400
- I'll take this.
- Enjoy!

1264
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,400
Run away!

1265
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,560
Don't make fun of my girl.

1266
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,000
You want to become a rowdy?

1267
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,600
- Leave him
- Are you pimping for him?

1268
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,760
If I ever
see your face again...

1269
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,640
I will send you to sleep
with the fishes.

1270
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,960
Buzz off!

1271
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,160
Go.

1272
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,360
Puny little runt...
thinks he can mess with me.

1273
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,800
You felt bad that
I was ragging her...?

1274
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,960
Now I'll send my men
to every alley in the hood.

1275
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,400
I'll surround her with guys
who are better than you...

1276
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,840
and praise her away from you!

1277
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,880
When I came alone,
he hit me just once.

1278
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,400
But I come with you and
he hit me a dozen times.

1279
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,000
Can you talk to him?

1280
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,600
I can't get involved
in these petty affairs.

1281
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,040
It's not a petty affair!

1282
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,520
They're ragging my girl!

1283
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,240
He says they'll rag her from every street.
That's petty?

1284
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,320
It's a serious matter!

1285
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,480
There are people in deep trouble,
trying to save their lives!

1286
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,280
That's just his drunk talk.
He'll forget when he sobers down.

1287
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,360
- What if he doesn't forget?
- What if?

1288
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,840
What are you going to
do about it?

1289
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,240
Anbu...
You're making a mistake.

1290
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,520
He's the one making a mistake!

1291
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,640
Just talk to him, for me?

1292
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,560
Then he'll bring his knife to kill you.

1293
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,200
You'll bring yours?

1294
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,640
Is that the life you want?

1295
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,920
Go.

1296
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,640
Our Muthu Mariamman temple...

1297
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,280
Is it sorted, then?

1298
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,360
No more problems for my sister?

1299
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,080
We request our devotees
on behalf of temple committee...

1300
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,080
...come and get
deity's blessings and offerings

1301
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,640
When she goes to college...

1302
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,000
Kannan...

1303
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,280
What?

1304
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,160
- Stand over there and cover me.
- Why?

1305
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,360
Just do it.

1306
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,240
That's enough.
He is already so drunk.

1307
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,640
You want to talk to him again?

1308
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,880
We won't have any problems
this time?

1309
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,880
Last time,
we went empty handed.

1310
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,560
But we're carrying weapons
this time.

1311
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,440
He'll know we mean business.
He'll pay attention.

1312
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,400
How do you have it tucked inside?
Mine is slipping into my pants!

1313
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,320
Shut your trap, boy.

1314
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,720
Not in front of his drinking buddies.

1315
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,000
He'll try to act cool
by making fun of us.

1316
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,320
Let's talk it out
once they leave.

1317
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,760
Just crash here
for the night.

1318
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,400
No! I'm going home.

1319
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,840
I need to take the kids to school tomorrow.

1320
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,040
You are tanked

1321
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,080
Shall I come along?

1322
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,360
I'm fine, guys.
I can manage.

1323
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,960
One moment.

1324
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,480
We need to talk.

1325
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,240
Just this morning I warned you,
and you're back again?

1326
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,600
Please don't rag her, brother.
She's a girl from your hood, after all.

1327
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,360
Can't I rag a girl from my hood?

1328
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,200
If I don't, who will?

1329
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,040
Please don't.

1330
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,640
She goes to college.
Leave her alone.

1331
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,040
Fine!

1332
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,680
What else?

1333
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,000
Kumar...

1334
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,720
You're carrying tools?

1335
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,360
No, we didn't mean to...

1336
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,960
No...no, bro

1337
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,400
You white punk,
what did I tell you?

1338
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,080
- I'll stab you in the butt.
- Please, let us go.

1339
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,400
You've got no flesh there?

1340
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,200
It hurts, doesn't it?

1341
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,160
Let's just make peace?

1342
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,960
I came here to make peace.
- You dare to preach me?

1343
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,280
You bring tools to make peace?

1344
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,600
Please try to understand,
I really wouldn't have...

1345
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,320
We didn't mean to harm you,
but just talk...

1346
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,280
Did you bring tools
to make me understand?

1347
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,680
- Oh, you're coming to get me?
- Yes!

1348
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,600
Not at all.

1349
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,720
Boy, get out of here.
Listen to me.

1350
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,440
What's going on?

1351
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,840
Nothing, brother!

1352
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,680
I spared you this morning
because you're from our hood.

1353
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,440
I'm not sparing you now.

1354
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,920
You actually stabbed me?

1355
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,120
Or you would have
stabbed him.

1356
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,960
Kannan, get back!

1357
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,840
- You too?
- Let's both go!

1358
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,120
Go away.

1359
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,960
- Let's leave.
- Just go!

1360
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,560
Brother...

1361
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,640
We didn't come
to stab you

1362
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,800
Why is he honking non-stop?

1363
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,600
Let's head back.

1364
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,080
Don't run.

1365
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,280
That's our new fibre-boat.

1366
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,920
Run now!

1367
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,160
What happened, Pazhani?

1368
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,320
Bro...bro

1369
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,760
See if he is still breathing.

1370
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,360
See those guys there?
Don't spare them.

1371
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,600
They're the ones.

1372
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,640
Look, they're going that way.

1373
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,200
Let's change clothes.

1374
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,120
Thus it begins.

1375
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,160
Don't be shy,
you can talk to him.

1376
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,280
If you don't like,
just leave it

1377
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,400
I'm scared that they'll get you
like they got Vadivel.

1378
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,560
There is a another matter

1379
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,680
Just get a bail and leave.

1380
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,640
Superintendent doesn't seem
to work for bribe

1381
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,360
If I clear all my past records,
I'll get a posting in the party.

1382
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,840
Should I ruin all that
fearing this guy?

1383
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,640
We should find a way
to arrive at a compromise with him.

1384
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,120
Let's try talking to Muthu again?

1385
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,520
Have you eaten?

1386
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,920
Yes, boss.

1387
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,840
There are many men in our block
who are good at carom.

1388
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,240
There are good players
in other blocks, too.

1389
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,200
If we organise a tournament
under your leadership...

1390
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,960
Boy, we're discussing serious matters.
We have no time for a tournament!

1391
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,440
It's more than that.

1392
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,680
This will be a good chance for us
to build a rapport with the superintendent.

1393
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,840
Then we go back to...

1394
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,200
He's right.

1395
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,520
Let's take it up with the superintendent.

1396
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,120
- If you have any concerns...
- Hello, sir.

1397
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,840
It would be nice if you could organise
a carom tournament for the inmates, sir.

1398
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,360
There are many talented players
in our block.

1399
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,920
And other blocks, too.

1400
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,760
I was told that
you would support sports.

1401
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:40,160
If you organise a tournament,
the men will have a healthy distraction.

1402
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,400
They won't worry
about other things.

1403
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,400
Okay, permission granted.

1404
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,760
First round will be held
inside prison blocks

1405
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,320
Quarter final, semi final, final and
prize function will be conducted out side

1406
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,760
Knockout game.
Best of one.

1407
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,240
Only the winner qualifies
for the next round.

1408
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,640
"Try to knock it down
even it is a Vulture"

1409
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,840
White.

1410
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,360
"If you lost yourself
Find other ways to overcome"

1411
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,080
"He just threw the net"

1412
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,520
"And caught an innocent worm"

1413
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,000
"Executed the plan and made it success"

1414
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,120
"Became an enemy to somebody"

1415
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,720
Anbu wins the first match.

1416
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,720
"Executed the plan and made it success"

1417
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,400
"Became an enemy to somebody"

1418
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,000
Match won by Senthil.

1419
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,920
Your brother is playing very well

1420
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,440
Oh, you have no idea.

1421
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,680
Wait till you see him tomorrow.

1422
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,560
There must be around 150
of Senthil's men out there.

1423
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,520
This is going to be hard.

1424
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,560
But none of his guys are clever enough
to thwart our plan.

1425
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,000
Let's see if there is someone
who can save him.

1426
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,240
Quarter finals... Anbu from 7th Block,
and Sundar from Life Block.

1427
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,680
Let's conduct this inside a block, sir.

1428
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,000
If it goes out of hand,
we can't control it.

1429
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,360
Like what?

1430
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,960
Siva, we can't afford a miss.

1431
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,920
If we end their regime
in my term...

1432
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I can leave with the reputation
of having cleaned up this prison.

1433
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:21,960
Tell me, Arun

1434
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,160
They have a mole in our block!

1435
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,560
- What?
- He is the one leaking information.

1436
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,680
A mole in our block?
That's impossible.

1437
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,040
I don't know who the person is.

1438
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,720
But he called and
they're all packing tools.

1439
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,560
Are you sure of this?

1440
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,160
Make sure he
doesn't step out today.

1441
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,920
Mani just called my phone.
They're waiting armed and ready.

1442
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,880
It's not like we're going unarmed.

1443
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,520
You are all going to carry tools, too.

1444
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:43,080
Why should we take chances
at such a moment?

1445
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,840
I organised this tournament.
How can I not play?

1446
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,640
How long do we wait?

1447
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,720
Ask him to play,
or ask him to accept defeat.

1448
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,040
He'll be coming.

1449
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,400
As if you have another appointment

1450
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,000
What's your hurry
to lose?

1451
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,120
I'll try not to score a century
and embarrass you.

1452
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,240
Cut it, guys.

1453
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,120
Consider this your last warning.

1454
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,720
- Raju, shut up.
- But he talks too much.

1455
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,080
- Go fetch our boss.
- Right away.

1456
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,920
You take this.
We'll be around.

1457
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,120
I'll grab the weapon from my attacker
and kill him.

1458
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,160
I don't need this.

1459
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,160
- Gopi, ask him to hurry up...
- I'll ask him to come right away.

1460
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,320
Are you blind?
Look what you've done!

1461
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,320
- Sorry, it was an accident.
- My foot!

1462
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,480
You idiot! Why did
you come charging?

1463
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,800
Raju asked me to
fetch the boss immediately.

1464
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,200
- I'll break your bones later.
- They were humiliating our boss.

1465
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,440
- What happened, boss?
- Let him go.

1466
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,040
Go.

1467
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,600
Get out of my sight.

1468
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:51,760
Let's go.

1469
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,440
This is a bad omen.
Let's go back inside.

1470
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,360
Don't be silly.

1471
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,800
How will you play
with a detached nail?

1472
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,120
Third and final call for Senthil.

1473
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,200
Step aside.

1474
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,200
Referee...

1475
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,640
Senthil has conceded a walk-over.
He's asked you to go ahead.

1476
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,480
Senthil concedes a walk-over.

1477
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,640
- He injured his finger.
- Match won by Siva.

1478
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,120
What?

1479
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,680
They conceded a walk-over.

1480
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,960
It's not his day to die.

1481
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,880
What's the point in watching?

1482
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,480
This was our last shot.

1483
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,320
Wonder how long we'll have to wait
for another opportunity.

1484
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,840
I was planning to
finish another guy in this chaos.

1485
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,240
 This is pissing off!

1486
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,840
Ask the armed boys
to come back.

1487
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,520
Let our boys stay out there.

1488
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,840
I have this feeling...

1489
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,320
that we can
get Senthil today.

1490
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,640
Today will be the last
day of his life.

1491
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,440
Anbu wins the first quarter finals.

1492
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,120
Mic 1 to Mic 3.
Come in.

1493
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,880
Received, sir.
Hello.

1494
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,280
Check if Senthil
has stepped out.

1495
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,600
Received.

1496
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,480
Final match
7th block Anbu

1497
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,760
He is just an average player.

1498
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,040
Well, I wish the boss was here.

1499
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,440
I wanted to win this for our block.

1500
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,800
Shame that he's hurt.

1501
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,680
He's hiding in there
afraid of losing.

1502
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,880
And he inspires you to win?

1503
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,120
I'll knock your teeth off.

1504
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,480
He'd better shut up now.

1505
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,440
So you'd win if the boss is here?

1506
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,000
- Definitely
- I'll get him.

1507
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:40,960
Velu!

1508
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,640
I told you he'd come.

1509
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,480
It's not safe out here.
Why did you bring him?

1510
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,960
That guy kept running his mouth.

1511
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,320
So I went to the boss.

1512
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,760
Sit down.

1513
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,440
Mic 3 to Mic 1.

1514
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,000
The prisoner has arrived.

1515
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,760
Mic 1 to Mic 3.

1516
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,840
If things are secure
at the match premises...

1517
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,760
forward the strength
to the other task.

1518
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,080
- Report to my office.
- Let's go.

1519
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,120
They're surrounding us.

1520
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,480
I see that.

1521
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,600
Shouldn't you go inside?

1522
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,160
And do what?

1523
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:09,040
Run and hide from these kids
so they can brag about it?

1524
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,800
Siva!

1525
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,520
Velu! You can't get to him
while we're alive.

1526
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,600
He is alone
We are three people. Don't worry

1527
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,680
If we leave him today,
we can't kill him, come and kill

1528
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:45,040
Hey, wait! Senthil is there
Wait

1529
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,920
Mic 1 to Mic 3.
And all Mics.

1530
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,520
Forward the total strength
to the match premises.

1531
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,680
What are you doing?

1532
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,200
He's seen you stab Senthil.
We can't let him live.

1533
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,680
No, I trust him.
Get out of here, Raju.

1534
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,400
I've waited so long to get him.

1535
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,520
Just get out of here.

1536
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,920
Go and check on Velu.

1537
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,160
Senthil gave you protection.

1538
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,720
And you have betrayed him!

1539
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,080
Not betrayal

1540
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,600
This is loyalty.

1541
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,800
My loyalty lies with Guna.

1542
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,760
Yet to finish your shift?

1543
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,240
Today over time, sir

1544
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,120
Your friend will...

1545
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,040
Which way is the prison ward?

1546
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,320
Straight down, and make a right.

1547
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,320
Kumar...

1548
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,280
The doctor says my husband
is critical.

1549
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,840
I'm scared, little brother.

1550
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,400
They say he may never walk again.

1551
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,000
I can't bear to see my man this way.

1552
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,760
This is a complicated case.

1553
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,880
Thoracic spine injury and brain injury.

1554
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,520
He's taken a fall after being stabbed
and suffered a head injury.

1555
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,600
There is a clot in his brain.

1556
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,520
Recovery is a little tough.

1557
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:27,720
If we give him physiotherapy
along with medication, it might improve.

1558
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,120
Find out who did this,
and kill him.

1559
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,960
I remember clearly.
I stabbed Velu.

1560
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,120
So it wasn't him.

1561
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,040
The boss took care of Siva.

1562
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,080
So it's not him, either.

1563
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,960
Who could have stabbed him?

1564
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,320
He was betrayed.

1565
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,280
- Oh, shut up.
- Now he's bedridden!

1566
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,280
He's sloshed.
Get him to lie down, Anbu.

1567
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,800
I can't even speak the truth
because you saved my life.

1568
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,960
You've wronged him.

1569
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,520
Senthil is such a good man, you know?

1570
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,600
Before judging my actions...

1571
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,440
you need to know
what Guna has done for me.

1572
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,520
ANBU - GUNA - CHANDRA

1573
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,240
After stabbing 'Jawa' Pazhani...

1574
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,000
Anbu and Kannan, helpless and scared,
went to Thambi for help.

1575
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,640
I warned you so many times.

1576
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,320
I never thought things would
turn out this way.

1577
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,000
We wanted to make a point
that he can't just bully us.

1578
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,560
That's why we went with tools.

1579
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,520
Did they see your faces
when they chased you?

1580
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,720
I am not sure.

1581
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,320
But we changed our clothes
and got away.

1582
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,400
It all happened so fast.

1583
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,160
If I go to prison, there's no one
to take care of my mother.

1584
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,720
- You've lost your life, boy.
- Please don't say that!

1585
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,600
I have a Nationals training camp
in Bombay next week.

1586
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,040
- Please help me out.
- What can I say?

1587
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,600
You grow up seeing something,
you think that's life.

1588
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:39,200
Go to Guna's house.
I'll talk to him.

1589
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,040
- Prashanth!
- Yes, Karthi?

1590
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,720
These boys want to see Guna.
Thambi sent them.

1591
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,960
- It's me!
- Come Kathir

1592
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,240
Soori, they want to see the boss.
Something important.

1593
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,720
Don't just barge in.
The situation is quite tense.

1594
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,000
- What were you thinking?
- He says he didn't do it.

1595
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,920
Why would you kill him?

1596
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,680
He's ruined everything.
I want to choke him to death.

1597
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,680
What?

1598
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,360
Just let it go.
It's not like Pazhani was a good man.

1599
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,800
That's not for us to decide.

1600
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,320
Why kill a man for no reason?
We've maintained peace for so long.

1601
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,160
- Why are you hitting the boy?
- You stay out of this.

1602
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:23,120
You've put me down all my life.
I'm a nobody now.

1603
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:27,600
I can't even get a job anywhere
because I'm Guna's little brother.

1604
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,840
I'm trying to make a living
showing locations for movie shooting.

1605
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,760
I carry tools in my
motorcycle to look cool.

1606
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,920
Does that mean I killed him?

1607
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,640
If I had the courage to do it,
I'd have become a big-shot myself.

1608
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,200
I had parked my bike
near the temple

1609
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,400
Brother!

1610
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,760
What?

1611
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,000
I swear I didn't do it.

1612
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,160
Why won't you believe me?

1613
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,880
There's been a situation

1614
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,960
Something to do with the girl?

1615
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:49,720
No...

1616
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,120
You leave now,
let's talk tomorrow.

1617
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,320
- It's not a good time.
- I assaulted somebody.

1618
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,880
What do you mean?

1619
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,600
I stabbed someone...

1620
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,280
Don't tell me you were the one
who stole the tools from Sankar's...

1621
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,440
It was me.

1622
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,600
Let's just bury him here.

1623
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,640
What's wrong with you, Guna?

1624
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,720
- This isn't new to us.
- Who are these punks?

1625
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,040
Where did they come from?

1626
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,480
My brother almost got into a murder case
because of them.

1627
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,160
He is from our hood.

1628
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,040
His name is Anbu.

1629
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,920
He plays carom at zonal level.

1630
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,640
If you're a carom player,
stick to striking coins!

1631
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,440
Don't go around
killing people.

1632
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,960
We didn't kill anyone.

1633
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,520
- We just stabbed him and got away.
- Shut up, boy.

1634
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,880
Pazhani is dead, you fools.

1635
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,640
Honey...

1636
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:34,840
Yes

1637
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,320
Tell me

1638
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:41,120
You were looking for a loyal person
unknown to Senthil.

1639
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,480
Give these boys protection now.

1640
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,760
They will pledge their lives to you.

1641
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:47,000
Siva, send these boys away.

1642
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,640
Give them some money.

1643
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,680
Take that money and go into hiding.
Don't come back for a year or so.

1644
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,680
Have you eaten?

1645
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,120
No.

1646
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:00,160
Guna, don't forget.
Senthil was once our ally.

1647
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,400
He could be our ally again.

1648
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,800
Senthil and Pazhani were
very close.

1649
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,800
If we protect these boys now...

1650
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,120
we can never make peace
with Senthil again.

1651
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,880
Anbu, don't worry.

1652
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,960
I'll take care of it.

1653
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,120
Dear...

1654
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,120
Trust me on this.

1655
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,960
Just give these boys some money
and send them away.

1656
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,800
I have a suggestion.
Just hear me out.

1657
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:25,080
If these boys don't turn themselves in,
it could be a good opportunity for Sankar.

1658
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,320
A dagger with Sankar's name
is lying on Pazhani's corpse.

1659
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,880
If no one 'takes the case', our Sankar
will be the prime accused.

1660
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:34,080
He could settle down comfortably,
just like you always wanted.

1661
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,880
Pazhani was no small time thug.

1662
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,960
You're right

1663
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:43,080
But I don't want to reignite
our enmity with Senthil.

1664
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,640
This is the opportunity
you were waiting for.

1665
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,200
Or I'll have to spend every passing day
fearing that you might

1666
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,800
If it comes to war,
he can't do a thing to me.

1667
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,920
Velu, let Sankar 'take' this case.

1668
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,600
We have so many men
who can take the record.

1669
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,640
Why send your little brother to prison?

1670
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,200
He is already 32 years old.

1671
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,760
But he's not done anything
with his life.

1672
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,720
He wants to settle down, too.

1673
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,760
If he turns himself in for this case,
he'll be respected in the hood.

1674
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,360
We can set some business up for him.

1675
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:12,160
Then he'll eventually
be able to find a bride, too.

1676
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,160
Siva, take them to the bridge safe-house.

1677
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,240
Okay.

1678
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,280
Anbu, Guna doesn't
help random strangers.

1679
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,960
You're getting protection
because Chandra put in a word.

1680
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,000
She's never asked him for anything
until now.

1681
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,360
As a first, she's asked him
to give you protection.

1682
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,040
That's why Guna agreed immediately.

1683
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,520
You don't need to worry now.
It's the safest place.

1684
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,080
Till Sankar turns himself in,
you can stay there.

1685
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,080
- Mani! How are you, brother?
- I'm fine.

1686
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,000
- Now I'm a gangster, too!
- That's nice to hear.

1687
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,400
I've only seen your face
through the bars in visitation room.

1688
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,320
I had no idea
you were so handsome!

1689
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,640
Welcome!
Let's go in.

1690
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,040
This murder has shaken up the town.

1691
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,760
Sankar, you need to be wary
about Senthil.

1692
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,360
He got into prison yesterday
to avenge Pazhani's murder.

1693
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,280
Pazhani was Senthil's strongest man.

1694
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,040
And I took him down on my own.

1695
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,880
I know how to handle this.

1696
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,960
Boy!

1697
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,800
Come here

1698
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,240
Sit!

1699
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,280
- Where are you from?
- Otteri.

1700
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,360
- Otteri?
- Yes

1701
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,880
- Do you know Govindan?
- I've heard of him.

1702
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,600
He's one of us, then.

1703
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,640
Hey, increase the sound

1704
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:25,400
Hey, increase the sound
else I will burn the screen

1705
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,320
Leader!

1706
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,600
When I stabbed that man,
his warm blood oozed out to my palm.

1707
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,200
I can still feel its warmth.

1708
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,000
I can't fall asleep.
I'm scared.

1709
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,560
He didn't expect us to stab him.

1710
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,360
But if we hadn't stabbed him,
he'd have killed us.

1711
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,440
Come, let's go.

1712
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,600
Don't make me disgrace
in front of this girl

1713
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,320
Go back and sit!

1714
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,320
I'm going to the toilet.

1715
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,120
- Why do you need him?
- To keep me company.

1716
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,560
Make it quick.

1717
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,400
It has gone

1718
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,520
Snake has gone

1719
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,040
Sankar!

1720
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,760
You think you can kill Pazhani
and hide from me in prison?

1721
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,640
Do you think I'd have done it?
My brother told me to turn myself in.

1722
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,800
Go out there and tell everyone
Sankar slipped in the toilet and died.

1723
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,040
I'm like a little brother
to you, too!

1724
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,240
Why do you want to kill me?

1725
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,480
You've known me since I was a child.

1726
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,160
Sir! Sankar is dead.

1727
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:36,560
"Our dear brother Sankar has died today;
Our beloved brother has passed away."

1728
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,720
You dare to come to his funeral?

1729
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,000
He's the reason Sankar died.

1730
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,160
Keep your mouth shut, now.

1731
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,880
What's wrong with you, Patrick?

1732
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,280
Clear the road for the visitors.
Move those chairs.

1733
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,280
Go on.

1734
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,560
Here he comes.

1735
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,840
Your mom asked to see you.

1736
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:02,960
I don't want to see her now.

1737
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,520
She's been crying for the past three days
asking for you.

1738
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,720
Just see her once.
She'll feel better.

1739
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,560
I don't have the courage.

1740
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:16,800
"He lived a high life in Kasimedu;
But now he's gone forever."

1741
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,320
Siva, come here.

1742
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,720
Anbu...

1743
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,280
Why have you brought them here?

1744
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,760
Is it not enough that we've lost Sankar?
Should these boys die, too?

1745
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,600
They were kept in a safe-house
to protect their identity.

1746
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,680
Anbu, leave now.

1747
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,560
- Take him away.
- Let's go.

1748
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,640
I asked you to put the chairs away.

1749
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:39,800
"Our commanding chief, our captain;
Your loss is too sudden."

1750
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,880
"In a casket adorned with flowers..."

1751
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,520
This is my fault.

1752
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:49,240
We must never take responsibility
for birth or death.

1753
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,720
We wanted what's best for him.
But it didn't work out.

1754
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,240
Who could have known?

1755
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,800
You should get back now.

1756
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,240
Take him, Siva.

1757
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,600
Don't think about all this now.

1758
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,200
You carry on with your life.

1759
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,760
I'll send word if I need you.

1760
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,040
'Anbu should have died
in Sankar's place that day.'

1761
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:09,760
'Guna gave up his brother's life
in order to save theirs.'

1762
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,600
'Anbu was prepared
to lay his life down for Guna.'

1763
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,920
Anbu!
What are you doing there?

1764
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,480
I came here alone
to watch that meeting.

1765
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:20,600
Oh, you've come alone?

1766
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,760
- Yes, I'm alone.
- Sure, I believe you.

1767
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,080
Hey, Kannan!

1768
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,560
What is up with you?

1769
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,440
Same old.
I drive a rented auto-rickshaw.

1770
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,800
Once my brother-in-law gets that job,
we're buying one.

1771
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,640
He's not your brother-in-law
until he marries your sister.

1772
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:38,440
Shut up.

1773
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,320
Your sister's up there with him.

1774
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,480
Soon we have to find a house for us

1775
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,680
Mother called you.

1776
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,840
I'll go in a bit.
You carry on.

1777
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,600
I said mom called you.
Go now!

1778
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,800
What's wrong with you?

1779
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,760
Nothing's wrong with me.
You're the one running wild.

1780
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,440
Watch your words, boy.

1781
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,960
What's wrong, Kannan?

1782
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,040
Nothing is wrong with me.

1783
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,000
The two of you don't realise
how people speak about you.

1784
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,960
You go now.
I'll sort it out.

1785
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,240
The District Secretary is so happy
that we made this meeting happen here.

1786
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,200
My husband has been asked
to come with a clean record.

1787
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,400
We can't do it without your support.

1788
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,600
What can I do?

1789
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,280
He's going to prison.

1790
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,040
He can't afford a new record
while he's in prison.

1791
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,880
That's only possible if Guna and him
resolve their differences.

1792
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,800
You need to mediate a compromise
between them.

1793
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,840
Your husband has betrayed Guna
too many times.

1794
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,560
Why should Guna compromise now?

1795
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,680
Marry my sister.

1796
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:35,600
I am going to marry her
after I get a job.

1797
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:36,560
Marry her now.

1798
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,560
I don't have a job yet.
Your father...

1799
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,320
Everyone's talking.

1800
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,240
The District Secretary believes
in my husband.

1801
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:48,680
He's been promised a post in the Party
if he comes with a clean record.

1802
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:53,320
If he makes it in politics,
please get Guna to work with my husband?

1803
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,320
Why would Guna switch Parties now?

1804
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,720
People switch everything
to their convenience.

1805
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,920
What's wrong in switching Parties
for friendship?

1806
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,640
Buddy, you should take it up.

1807
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,280
So what's his deal?

1808
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,240
He wants to give up
all illegal trade...

1809
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,920
get a posting in the Party
and become a full time politician.

1810
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,320
And once it's done...

1811
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,320
he wants us to give up
on politics.

1812
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,160
Ask Thambi to buzz off.
This is a bad idea...

1813
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:21,440
We suck up to politicians
to do our business anyway.

1814
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,040
At least Senthil will understand
all our problems.

1815
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,560
He's one of our own, after all.

1816
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,600
Now he has a chance to be something
that we never could.

1817
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,000
Let's support him.

1818
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,080
My son is starting college soon.

1819
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,560
I'd like to settle down, too.

1820
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:35,400
Senthil is not to be trusted.
Remember when you murdered Rajan?

1821
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,560
He made you sit in prison
for one whole year.

1822
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:40,080
Meanwhile, he sold cocaine and became rich.

1823
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,440
He's trying to use you
to make it in politics.

1824
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,360
If we don't end his...

1825
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,640
Siva...

1826
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:47,760
Yes

1827
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,640
I'm so glad all this fighting can stop
and there will be peace.

1828
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,560
Why would you ruin that?

1829
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,000
If we let them go now,
they'll take over everything.

1830
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,280
Can we match upto his strength?

1831
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,520
What do you mean?
He's stronger than me?

1832
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:02,800
He's a crook who stole fishing nets
and then sold cocaine.

1833
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:03,920
I should be afraid of him?

1834
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,360
Why are you taking it out on me?

1835
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,960
Oh, it's not you

1836
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,720
Could I ever get mad at you?

1837
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,800
Chandra!

1838
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,560
Greeting, sir!

1839
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,320
- Are you fine?
- Fine

1840
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,280
Senthil won't allow you
to live peacefully

1841
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,440
What are you saying, sir?

1842
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,160
Senthil has paid someone to include
you and Velu in the encounter list.

1843
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,120
Don't leave home for a few days.

1844
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,560
I'll handle it.

1845
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,440
The commissioner has come up
with a new encounter list.

1846
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,680
Both our names
are in it.

1847
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,640
But why?

1848
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,640
You've not had any record
in the past three years.

1849
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,000
The elections are coming up.

1850
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,640
They probably want to
kill Opposition thugs to get votes.

1851
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:50,240
Inspector said it's Senthil
who had our names added.

1852
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,360
He called for a truce
but went behind our backs again.

1853
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,040
We can't let him live anymore, Velu.

1854
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,840
Your house is in the shanty?

1855
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,520
Yes, by the ocean.
It's nice and breezy.

1856
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,240
My daughter grew up
in this concrete house.

1857
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:08,600
Why should I get her married...
only to live in a hut?

1858
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,640
He's a state level carom player.

1859
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:13,480
- He'll get a state government job.
- Shut up, girl. Don't interrupt me.

1860
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:16,160
Thinks I'll get my daughter married
to any scum that comes along?

1861
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,720
I won't react no matter how badly
you insult us, father-in-law.

1862
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,280
Because I'm in love
with your daughter.

1863
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,720
I'm determined to marry her.
Only her.

1864
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,440
Say what you want to say.
Just get us married.

1865
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,840
I know whom to get my
daughter married to.

1866
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:32,840
The police may not know about
the two of you and all your activities.

1867
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,880
But I know all about it.
Get out.

1868
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,360
Wait, Mom!

1869
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,680
Dad, just listen to me.

1870
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,240
Padma loves me, Father-in-law.

1871
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,440
First, stop calling me that.
Get out!

1872
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,160
- Get up!
- Mom...

1873
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,000
He speaks so disrespectfully.

1874
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,400
Should we put up with this?

1875
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,560
I'll find you a better bride.
Let's leave.

1876
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,160
Padma will only marry me.

1877
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,160
I can't leave unless he agrees.

1878
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,680
Please, understand.
Leave that there, Auntie.

1879
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,680
You think you're the big guy here?
Get out.

1880
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,080
Come with me, Anbu.

1881
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,000
Mom...

1882
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,680
Let's all leave together,
with Padma.

1883
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,960
Leave together?
If she comes, you can take her.

1884
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:07,280
Take her if she comes.
I know my daughter.

1885
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,760
Scared?

1886
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,200
You know you'll be humiliated
if she refuses.

1887
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,640
I am scared.

1888
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,160
But for a completely different reason.

1889
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,280
I know she'll come with me
if I say the word.

1890
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,600
We'll have to face each other often
after the wedding.

1891
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:34,360
Every time you see me, I don't want to
be the guy your daughter chose over you.

1892
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,120
She shouldn't have to
make that choice.

1893
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,840
Am I right, Padma?

1894
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,960
I'll marry her only if you give consent.

1895
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,480
Then my daughter won't get married
till I die.

1896
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,160
You stupid old man!

1897
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:47,360
I've been so patient,
but he keeps talking crap.

1898
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,160
He's come all the way to speak to you.
Think she doesn't want him too?

1899
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,720
You know all about
your son's activities.

1900
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,440
Ask anyone in the hood what your
daughter has been upto for 8 years.

1901
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,120
Won't get her married?

1902
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,160
I'll whack you...

1903
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,480
Come on, Kannan.
We're family....

1904
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,920
This is how you deal with this guy.

1905
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,120
Keep quiet, Kannan!
He is our dad.

1906
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,200
Don't act all prudish now.
Go with him.

1907
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,800
Take her home.

1908
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,160
I'll deal with this guy.

1909
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,960
Leave when he's still in shock.
I'll deal with it later.

1910
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,320
Goodbye!

1911
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,200
Take her.
I'll talk to him.

1912
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,240
- Pull over at some temple.
- What for?

1913
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,040
Let's get the wedding
done with.

1914
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,480
No, we must fix an auspicious date.

1915
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,680
Get a shave first.
You can get married later.

1916
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:30,400
You're right, Mother-in-law.
He needs a shave.

1917
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,400
What for?

1918
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,760
For the first night.

1919
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,440
Like it's our first night

1920
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,320
Isn't that what we're supposed to say?

1921
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,480
Okay, then.

1922
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,360
- I need a shave!
- Sit

1923
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,360
I'm getting married,
let's see a smile on your face!

1924
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,960
Done!

1925
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,280
Anbu, Guna wants to see you.

1926
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,760
Will you do me a favour?

1927
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,560
Of course. Anything.
Tell me!

1928
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,000
You know this Senthil...?

1929
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,000
He's gone to prison pretending
to call a truce with me.

1930
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,880
I was prepared to take it, too.

1931
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,680
But then I found out
the whole thing was a set-up.

1932
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:06,520
Before going to prison, he's had our names
included in the encounter list.

1933
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:10,000
He's pretending to extend the olive branch
to hide his involvement in the list.

1934
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,960
If we let him go now
he'll end our lives.

1935
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,560
We should kill him
while he's in prison.

1936
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:17,360
He's holed up with his men
in the 7th block.

1937
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,000
They don't let in anyone new.

1938
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,760
Once he goes to prison,
he won't leave his block.

1939
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,920
But we've got our men on stand-by
to kill him if he steps out of his block.

1940
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,120
Anbu...

1941
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,360
In order to kill him
inside the prison...

1942
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,240
we need our man in his block.

1943
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,360
It has to be someone
Senthil doesn't recognise as ours.

1944
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,160
And we need the guy to infiltrate
Senthil's gang, get close.

1945
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,320
Only the best of men
can achieve that.

1946
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,800
But you can do it.

1947
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,680
Senthil is a good carom player.

1948
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,520
He likes to play with an equal match.

1949
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:50,080
When he sees your game,
he will be astounded.

1950
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,200
He will take you in.

1951
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:52,640
What should I do?

1952
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:55,280
Will you go to prison
and infiltrate his block, for me?

1953
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,080
If you're not comfortable,
just say so.

1954
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,880
I'll find an alternative.

1955
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,160
I owe you my life.
I'll do as you say.

1956
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,800
Velu...

1957
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,960
I have two pending cases.
I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

1958
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,120
Siva and you stage a quarrel
for the girl outside the police station.

1959
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,760
Hit a cop or two
if needed.

1960
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,480
When you're in prison, we'll take you in
and pretend to harass you.

1961
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,760
We suspect there's a rat in our block.

1962
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,480
So Senthil will hear about you.

1963
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,360
Senthil has a mule called Raju.

1964
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,360
Make friends with him.
He'll get you into Senthil's block.

1965
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,440
I'll charge at him.

1966
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,080
You save his life
and become his friend.

1967
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:26,960
Once you're in...

1968
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:30,520
 use your carom skills
to get Senthil's attention.

1969
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,160
Gain his trust.

1970
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,120
Find the right time and excuse
to lure him out of the block.

1971
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,240
Your job is only to bring him out.

1972
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:40,360
Our boys will handle the rest.
No one will suspect you.

1973
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,040
We'll bail you out
the very next day.

1974
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,360
Sounds good?

1975
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,880
Just tell me when I should go.

1976
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,240
I'll tell you.

1977
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,200
You're all dressed up.

1978
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:49,960
What's special?

1979
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:50,840
It's nothing.

1980
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:51,800
- Bye
- See you

1981
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:52,800
Goodbye.

1982
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,840
You don't know Guna.

1983
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,360
When he's done with you,
he'll cut you off.

1984
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,520
Lie down, now.

1985
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,640
The truth will come out,
some day or the other.

1986
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:07,160
Wherever you are,
they'll find you and kill you.

1987
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:10,600
You think they'd spare you
if you leave on bail?

1988
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:11,960
They won't.

1989
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,320
Go after I inform

1990
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:14,760
Go now

1991
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,280
It feels weird
to say this out loud...

1992
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,160
But I feel Senthil might be
a better person than Guna.

1993
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,280
He took good care of me.

1994
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,760
What can I do?
I owe this life to Guna.

1995
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,000
Forget about it.

1996
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,360
They're all criminals anyway.

1997
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:30,080
I just want to marry Padma
and go away somewhere.

1998
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,880
Why go away?
Stay by my side.

1999
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,920
Now I run the show.
I'm on top of the town.

2000
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,080
Everyone else is below me.

2001
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:40,200
But the reason I'm up here today
is you.

2002
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,760
Velu and you planned the attack.

2003
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,400
And the men were set up by you.

2004
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,040
But you're the one who stabbed Senthil.

2005
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,520
None of our boys
could go anywhere close to him.

2006
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,840
You grabbed the opportunity.

2007
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,640
I didn't even stab him properly.

2008
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:57,280
Had we stabbed and killed him,
he'd have received a hero's funeral...

2009
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,080
and Senthil's chapter would have
been forgotten right there.

2010
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,920
Because you stabbed him,
he's paralysed.

2011
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,720
Every time he walks around disabled,
our enemies will think about us.

2012
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:09,720
They won't mess with us,
fearing they'd end up like him.

2013
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,840
How will anyone challenge us then?

2014
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:16,520
Storage contracts, liquor store contracts,
harbour unions - it's all ours.

2015
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,680
Join my gang.

2016
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,320
Me, Velu, and then it will be you.

2017
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:22,160
No.

2018
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:25,480
Ever since I was a kid,
I've wanted to be a carom player.

2019
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,520
I wanted to play, get a job
at the harbour, just like Mom wanted...

2020
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,160
marry the woman I love...

2021
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,760
I wanted to live an honourable life
as a sportsman, in our hood.

2022
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,680
Somehow, somewhere...

2023
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,840
my life went off course.

2024
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,920
Ever since I stabbed Senthil
with a piece from the board...

2025
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,240
every time I hold the striker.

2026
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,440
Then why do you wish to play?

2027
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,440
Come and work for me.

2028
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,080
Don't misunderstand me

2029
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,240
I no longer know
who is good and who is bad.

2030
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:56,680
Just let me go.

2031
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,760
Before all this, Thambi wanted me to
take charge of the carom club.

2032
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,000
I'll just do that.

2033
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:04,600
Men who can't even hold a dagger
call themselves gangsters.

2034
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,800
But you've got a natural talent,
and yet you run away from this.

2035
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,680
I just don't get it.

2036
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,960
This is nothing to be proud of.

2037
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,400
Goodbye.

2038
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,960
The pocket, the coin, and the striker
over the rule.

2039
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,400
All three in
one straight line.

2040
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:25,160
Align your body towards
the same direction.

2041
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:29,040
Right leg forward, left leg back.
Both at 90 degrees.

2042
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,920
You know that gentle moment
when you blink your eyelids...?

2043
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,960
Release the striker
with the same gentleness.

2044
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
In a perfect shot, the
striker ends up where the coin was,

2045
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,800
and the coin in the pocket.

2046
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,120
Use the right amount of force.

2047
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:42,760
I asked the builder for money.
He refused.

2048
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,440
I can't eat so much!

2049
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,120
Must you talk about this
while he's eating?

2050
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,360
You can talk to him later.

2051
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:51,080
If this goes on, all
the boys will leave.

2052
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,440
We won't have any boys
left to work.

2053
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,360
We get rent money
from 60 odd houses.

2054
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,160
And we have the cable TV business.

2055
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:57,680
Is that money not enough?

2056
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,760
I can manage if we get
all the overdue payments.

2057
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:01,840
They don't fear us anymore.

2058
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:04,480
If you ask them the right way,
why would they not pay?

2059
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,720
Shall I deal with them?

2060
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,240
He got you the police department job
to keep you off all this.

2061
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,160
Just do your job properly.

2062
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,440
I will ask them the right way.

2063
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,240
Are you even listening?

2064
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,080
Do it.

2065
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,760
Sign this petition to stay
the construction of the road over our hood.

2066
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,360
You're doing a good thing.

2067
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,640
If they take away our homes,
where would we go?

2068
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:28,560
Padma, could you sign the petition?

2069
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:29,680
Ask my husband.

2070
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,760
You're more educated than him.
It makes more sense if you sign.

2071
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,200
- Here.
- Fine.

2072
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:36,360
Anbu, are you at home?

2073
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,560
I'm at the club.
We're having a practice session.

2074
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,000
What about your mother and Padma?

2075
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,840
- Why?
- Kalaa has attained puberty.

2076
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,000
I must invite all of you.

2077
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,120
She was a little girl!

2078
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,120
Everyone will be there.
You should, too.

2079
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:48,080
No excuses, you must come.

2080
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:49,920
Senthil will be there too?

2081
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:50,880
Of course.

2082
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,880
What if they spot me there?

2083
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:54,480
None of his boys
know what happened.

2084
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:59,120
Moreover, a road contractor has asked me
to settle things between Guna and Senthil.

2085
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:00,120
He'll be there, too.

2086
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,680
If things go well,
all your problems will be solved.

2087
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:03,840
Are you sure?

2088
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,320
It's my family event.

2089
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,680
No one will come with animosity.

2090
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:12,560
"Rub sandal paste on those tender cheeks;
Lay out the presents for the world to see."

2091
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,280
That room is enough

2092
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:20,200
"Thambi's little girl
has attained womanhood"

2093
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:23,280
"From a bud, a flower has bloomed."

2094
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:33,480
"All of her uncles have called for truce;
Tonight we'll dance to our native tunes."

2095
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,920
"All of the family has been invited;
All the streets in the hood brightened."

2096
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,280
Welcome!
So glad you could make it.

2097
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,080
Go inside

2098
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:50,480
"Rub sandal paste on those tender cheeks;
Lay out the presents for the world to see."

2099
01:36:54,680 --> 01:37:00,480
We extend our heartfelt welcome
to our brother Guna...

2100
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,200
When Sanjay comes,
seat him inside.

2101
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,800
- Anbu is here.
- Welcome.

2102
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,880
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

2103
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:07,840
Go in.

2104
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:20,920
"Baby girl, you're a butterfly in skirts;
Here come your uncles bearing gifts."

2105
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:27,840
Anbu!

2106
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,280
Anbu...

2107
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,800
Guna sent for you.

2108
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,040
He is in there.

2109
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,560
"Get rid of all those
old and shabby clothes"

2110
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,760
"Let's put on some new ones and pose."

2111
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,520
Yes, go right in.

2112
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,920
There he is.

2113
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,200
Hello, Anbu.
How are you?

2114
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,720
- I'm fine.
- Sit.

2115
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:58,880
That boy Hameed, Faizal's son...

2116
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,480
he is your friend, right?

2117
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:01,480
Yes. Why do you ask?

2118
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,000
If he has a bank job...

2119
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,920
he should move someplace nice with family
and buy an apartment there.

2120
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,280
What's he still doing here?

2121
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:09,680
We have a flat in Besant Nagar.

2122
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,520
I can give him a duplex apartment
if he wants.

2123
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:15,720
I don't understand.

2124
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,160
It's simple...

2125
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:20,080
He's constructing a road
so that trucks can come to our Harbour.

2126
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:21,880
The roads pass over our hoods.

2127
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,880
So many of our people
have died in truck accidents.

2128
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:26,600
These broad roads
will benefit everyone.

2129
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:28,320
Everyone in town is okay with it, too.

2130
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,800
Hameed has submitted a petition in courts
and stayed the project.

2131
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:33,240
He thinks he can do anything
because he's educated?

2132
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,320
Anbu, he's from our hood.
And a friend of yours.

2133
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,000
So we're trying to keep this civil.

2134
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,760
It won't take us too long
to beat him down.

2135
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:44,840
We have a meeting tomorrow
between the officials and representatives.

2136
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,280
You bring him there.
Let's make him understand.

2137
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:51,680
Okay.

2138
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,880
I'll get going.

2139
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,760
- Will he do it?
- Of course.

2140
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,280
He's sharper than we were at his age.

2141
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:02,160
He can operate solo.

2142
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:06,200
- How did it go?
- We just spoke.

2143
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,080
Use the mic!

2144
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:16,680
We welcome 'Royapuram' Senthil
and thank him for gracing this occasion...

2145
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,160
Kannan!

2146
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,120
Yes

2147
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:25,280
Let's get out of here.
Ask Padma to come.

2148
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:31,800
- It's time to leave.
- Okay

2149
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,680
- Goodbye, then.
- See you

2150
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:40,840
"Look at that anklet chiming in her feet;
And those earrings move to the beat."

2151
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:47,920
Anbu, what are you doing here?

2152
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:48,800
Keep it

2153
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,400
I was invited.
Thambi is our...

2154
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,120
I forgot you were from the same hood!

2155
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:53,280
The boss is here.

2156
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,240
Your wife?

2157
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:56,200
Hello.

2158
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,440
Want to meet the boss?

2159
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,840
Sure.

2160
01:39:59,120 --> 01:39:59,840
Wait

2161
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,520
The boss has been depressed.
He smiles only when we talk about carom.

2162
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,480
He will be delighted
to see you.

2163
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,280
Look who's here.
It's the board player, Anbu.

2164
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:10,000
Hello.

2165
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,320
Come, sit

2166
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,600
Sit next to him.

2167
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:16,640
Your wife is waiting for you.
Get going.

2168
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,200
- I must go. My wife...
- Stay a little while.

2169
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:20,440
Okay

2170
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:25,040
Are you still playing?

2171
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,040
Bro...?

2172
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,720
- Are you still playing carom board?
- Yes...

2173
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:35,080
Look at me.
No more carom board for me.

2174
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,080
Enough with the dancing.
Let's go eat.

2175
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,960
Let's eat

2176
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:51,680
Giri, take everyone upstairs.

2177
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,680
Take them upstairs.

2178
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,400
I told you to wait
till everyone has gone to eat.

2179
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,760
- Hey
- Lets come for dinner

2180
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:56,880
What are you looking at?

2181
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,760
 Don't you dare take that tone with us.

2182
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,760
I set this meeting up
with great difficulty!

2183
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:07,560
Kumar, you have no respect
for elders?

2184
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,240
Anbu, where are you going?

2185
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:10,920
- I need to leave.
- No, stay.

2186
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Its getting heated up.
Won't you stand by Senthil now?

2187
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,200
- My wife is waiting outside...
- Wait!

2188
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,760
- Are you well, brother?
- Yes. I'm fine.

2189
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,240
I'm not.

2190
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:22,160
He was proud as a lion.
Look what you've done to him.

2191
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:23,960
You got me married to him.

2192
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:26,040
Now you've wrecked my life, too.

2193
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,680
Marie, what happened was unfortunate.

2194
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:31,440
This is a happy occasion.
Let's not discuss all this.

2195
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,320
You're good at handling these things.
But I only have one husband.

2196
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,840
Siva, come over here.
Let her sit there.

2197
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,600
You can have that seat.

2198
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,000
Look...

2199
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:53,640
If you two get together,
it makes our work easy.

2200
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,320
I'll make sure this deal
is equally beneficial to both gangs.

2201
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:59,280
We've always been ready
to make peace with them.

2202
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,880
Of course you are.
We're the victims here.

2203
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,120
You should be grateful that your husband
is still alive,

2204
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,080
after you killed our Sankar.

2205
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,600
I'd have preferred death over this.

2206
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:10,400
Please, I understand that both the sides
have suffered losses.

2207
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,920
But we're talking millions here.

2208
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,280
Don't let past differences
keep you from seeing better days.

2209
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,920
They speak so disrespectfully.
Why should we make peace?

2210
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,240
We'll make peace.

2211
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:21,840
But ask them to give up the man
who stabbed my husband.

2212
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:25,840
Making peace means burying the hatchet
and moving on.

2213
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,680
Why do you want to
revisit a closed chapter?

2214
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,840
How is it closed?
I need to end it.

2215
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:30,960
Give me the guy
and we'll move on.

2216
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,200
A dozen men went to fight.
Someone happened to stab him.

2217
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:35,720
Who knows which blow struck him?

2218
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:38,280
No way.
I was there.

2219
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:41,600
Arun called me ahead
and warned me you're planning to strike.

2220
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:43,200
We know you had a mole planted
in our block.

2221
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,360
But you killed Arun
before we could find out.

2222
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:48,160
We need to know
who that was.

2223
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:51,040
I know it wasn't done by
one of your men.

2224
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,720
If it was one of them...

2225
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:55,360
they'd have either killed my husband
or been killed by him.

2226
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:56,960
They wouldn't have done
a half-baked job.

2227
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,320
Someone did this with the intention
to make him a laughingstock.

2228
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:03,960
Since they insist,
why don't you consider it?

2229
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:06,520
Why are you hesitant?
It's just one guy.

2230
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,720
We will make millions.

2231
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:18,760
You don't punish the tool,
but the murderer.

2232
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:20,240
The man was just a tool.

2233
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:21,600
I don't care.

2234
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:22,640
We want the guy.

2235
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,680
That doesn't make sense.

2236
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,440
My sister wants the guy.
Her word is final.

2237
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:28,040
Give us the guy
who stabbed her husband.

2238
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:30,040
Or I won't hesitate to kill you all.

2239
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,880
Who the hell
do you think you are?

2240
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,920
- Are you a rowdy?
- We've come for peace.

2241
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:37,120
Let the heads talk.
Others can leave.

2242
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:38,240
Anbu, leave now.

2243
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:42,080
- Ask them to choose their words carefully.
- Guna, wait. I'll handle this.

2244
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:45,440
Kumar, if they give the guy up,
you think you can kill him?

2245
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,120
I've put in so much effort to
arrange for a compromise.

2246
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,600
Why are they fighting?

2247
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:52,920
I'll tell you.

2248
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:55,320
Whether I did the right thing
or not is secondary.

2249
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:59,400
When they asked for the attacker,
Guna just sat there mum.

2250
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:02,880
I've been foolishly loyal to him.

2251
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,320
You did this for Guna.
Why would they get you caught?

2252
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:08,160
I've grown up seeing them since
the Rajan's times.

2253
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,320
If they stand to gain from it,
they'd do anything.

2254
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:15,160
'Senthil, Guna, Velu,
Thambi, and Chandra.'

2255
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:17,680
'The link that connects them
to Anbu...'

2256
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:18,720
is Rajan.

2257
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:21,240
ANBU - RAJAN - THE HOOD

2258
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:32,080
'Rajan smuggled imported goods from
international container ships...'

2259
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:36,880
'in his catamarans fitted with bike engines
and sold them to illegal bazaar owners.'

2260
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,120
'TV, record players, imported liquor,
imported cigarettes...'

2261
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,560
'perfumes, jeans and shoes...'

2262
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,080
'it was Rajan who smuggled all of this.'

2263
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:44,400
What are you doing here, Mani?

2264
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:46,280
Muthu wants to meet Rajan.

2265
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:48,840
- Guna, take the crates to the go-down.
- Okay

2266
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:51,160
Thambi, go to the police station
and take care of Ramesh.

2267
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:54,880
Hameed, I've told you not to waste time
on marbles. Play carom instead.

2268
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,040
What's that?

2269
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:57,200
Binoculars.

2270
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:58,880
This makes faraway objects
appear closer.

2271
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,040
Can I see?

2272
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:01,560
- You want it?
- Yes!

2273
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,680
Keep it.

2274
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,120
Hello, Leader.

2275
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:20,920
Come on up.

2276
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:31,760
Tell me, Leader.

2277
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:36,160
So how did it go?

2278
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,040
Yes, Leader.

2279
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:39,080
No one has ever had
such a big haul.

2280
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,240
We've done it for the first time, ever.

2281
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,000
Then buy a house
on this side of the highway.

2282
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,800
You can live the good life.

2283
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,840
I can't live without the salty breeze
and the murky waters.

2284
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,680
Moreover, the people.

2285
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:50,080
Nowhere is safer than our hood.

2286
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:53,400
No one can enter the Harbour
without our knowledge.

2287
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,240
It's not just a hood.
It's my fortress.

2288
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,840
Fine, if that's how you feel.

2289
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,880
What I wanted to say is...

2290
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:01,200
That's Senthil.

2291
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:03,000
He's my man.
Don't worry, he's trustworthy.

2292
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,200
Come in.
You need not worry.

2293
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,160
- Aren't you Kumaresan's son?
- Yes, I am.

2294
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,560
You've got your father's nose!

2295
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:11,520
He's the sharpest of my boys.

2296
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:12,960
- Come, sit here.
- No, I'm fine.

2297
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,600
Come on!

2298
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:15,960
Sit.

2299
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:16,880
Tell me.

2300
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:19,480
Next year, the Pope is visiting
our country.

2301
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,680
You do know who that is?

2302
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,400
I'll ask my boys.

2303
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,240
Okay, then.
I get it.

2304
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:29,120
So, for his visit, they're cleaning up
the shanties along the Marina Beach.

2305
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:30,840
It's a good project.
So I made a suggestion...

2306
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,480
...they could extend the clean-up
till our Ennore coast.

2307
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:36,000
Maybe build some factories
or warehouses.

2308
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,320
Where will the people go?

2309
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:41,320
Obviously, the other side of the highway.
Near the government housing apartments.

2310
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:45,160
We'll build a better one for your people.
With state-of-the-art facilities.

2311
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:47,800
We'll get the contracts to construct
that building, widen the new roads,

2312
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,600
then we can have ice factories
and better infrastructure.

2313
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:53,560
Rajan, that Norway ship
that you're smuggling goods from?

2314
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:56,320
We'll get four such ships sailing
in your name.

2315
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,000
No...

2316
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:59,400
There's a meeting at the
Fishermen's Union tomorrow.

2317
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:01,880
Just stand by my side.
I'll handle everything else.

2318
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,520
Our suffering has come to an end.

2319
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,600
We've been suffering
for generations.

2320
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,200
At least our children can
have a better life.

2321
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,320
The Pope is visiting our country
next year.

2322
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:13,720
The Government has allocated a large sum
to clean up the slums along the coast...

2323
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,280
and build new industries there.

2324
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,280
When there is high tide,
we face so much danger.

2325
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:22,680
So you'll be relocated to a high-rise
concrete building away from the sea.

2326
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:23,760
Free of cost.

2327
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,160
Why would the government pay
for our homes?

2328
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:28,280
What are they going
to take from us?

2329
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,480
Why are you skeptical
about everything?

2330
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:34,000
Would our Chief Minister ever do anything
to hurt our people?

2331
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:36,600
Let's say we shift outside
our fishing village.

2332
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:39,880
Who will safeguard our boats
and nets in the sea?

2333
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,360
Durai...
We have Rajan on our side.

2334
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:43,880
He will always stand by me.

2335
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,360
Do you need a greater protection
for your boats and nets?

2336
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:48,600
How can we answer right away?

2337
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:49,920
We need time to discuss it.

2338
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,920
If Rajan gives his word,
we'll think about it.

2339
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:56,520
Now ask Rajan your questions.
He'll clarify them.

2340
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,920
Please don't take this the wrong way.

2341
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,920
All this time, I stood by you
for the good things you did for us.

2342
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:04,040
Not for betraying my people.

2343
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,480
Call yourself an opposition leader?

2344
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,560
You don't even know what
questions to ask the authorities.

2345
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:12,080
- Rajan...
- I'm not finished.

2346
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,640
Ask them what they'll do with our land
once we vacate it.

2347
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:18,920
We're planning to lay down a 100 ft road
and build ice factories by the Harbour.

2348
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,560
And give it to people from outside?

2349
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,680
No, no. We'll auction it
to the highest bidder.

2350
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:25,800
You bloody well know
we don't have the money to bid.

2351
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,680
So basically, it goes to outsiders.

2352
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:29,560
And will they stop with
just owning stores?

2353
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,640
They'll relocate their families here.

2354
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:34,480
They don't understand the sea
or our lifestyles.

2355
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:38,360
When we go to the sea
to do our jobs, they'll say we scare them.

2356
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:41,800
If we dry our fish in the sun,
they'll complain of stench.

2357
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:44,000
And you'll use cops
to chase us out.

2358
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,760
With no livelihood in our home town,
we'd have to find work elsewhere.

2359
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:49,200
Our children will go hungry
with no livelihood.

2360
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,000
Leader...

2361
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,520
You think we're pushovers?
To give our homeland to random strangers?

2362
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,560
Your tricks won't work on me.

2363
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,240
I don't care that you made me.

2364
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,920
- You dare to raise arms in our Union?
- None of you will get out alive!

2365
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,240
We're just talking here.
Calm down.

2366
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:03,440
Rajan, you speak.

2367
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:04,760
Leader...

2368
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:08,640
I'm not a dummy thug like them.
You know that.

2369
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,480
Tell them to behave.

2370
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:13,360
You men go into the sea
or go out to work.

2371
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:15,560
We women will be
alone with children.

2372
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:18,240
If they bring policemen to harass us,
what will we do?

2373
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,840
Until this issue is resolved,
we won't go to smuggle.

2374
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,360
The boys and I will be in the hood
at all times.

2375
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:24,320
Let's see who dares enter.

2376
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,320
But what if--

2377
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,920
If they come,
we'll fight them.

2378
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,480
Won't you slay a man or two?

2379
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:29,480
 I will.

2380
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:31,080
That's the spirit.

2381
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:32,240
Why do you look glum?

2382
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,040
Why won't you go to work?

2383
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:36,840
If we don't do it,
someone else will.

2384
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:38,320
Why should we give it up?

2385
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:42,160
All this time, we were fighting
for our own lives.

2386
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:44,440
But now, we're fighting
for all our people.

2387
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:47,720
We can't afford to commit crimes now
and put them all under risk.

2388
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:49,440
I know that

2389
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,240
But maybe you could stay away.

2390
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,560
Let us go to work?

2391
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:54,080
Come on!

2392
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:56,520
You, me... it's all the same.

2393
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:59,560
How do they separate us?

2394
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,600
Senthil, this is the girl
I saw at the temple.

2395
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:04,240
Where are you going?
I'm talking...

2396
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,040
- Thambi, come here.
- Yes?

2397
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:09,280
Is it just me,
or is that girl looking at me?

2398
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:12,000
I thought she was looking at me
the other day...

2399
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,520
No doubt, she is.
And she's making no secret of it.

2400
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:18,800
I'm just an old grampus.
Why would a pretty girl look at me?

2401
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,920
Wait, let me ask her?

2402
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:20,640
She is nice too

2403
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,480
Hello!

2404
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:22,840
Keep quiet!

2405
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:26,160
Stop blushing,
and look at her!

2406
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:31,200
Looks like I'm going to fall
for her smile.

2407
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:35,960
I'm going soft now...

2408
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,680
Which one is her house?
I'll talk to her father.

2409
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,680
- Where is it?
- First floor.

2410
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,640
Where do you think you're going?

2411
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:50,440
You can't go alone to ask for
a girl's hand in marriage!

2412
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:53,320
You can't go in there
and blow your own trumpet.

2413
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:08,040
You all look like thugs.
What purpose will it serve?

2414
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:11,280
Go alone, then.
They'll think you're The President.

2415
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,720
- Don't mock me.
- He could pass off for The President.

2416
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,560
Don't make me nervous!

2417
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:22,040
Guna! Isn't that the girl
you were checking out near the temple?

2418
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,320
To meet your father.

2419
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,160
- What now?
- I saw her.

2420
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:33,480
She didn't see me, did she?

2421
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,280
He gets it all.

2422
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,480
Go on, put on the glasses!

2423
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,080
Okay?

2424
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:54,400
She's the heroine from 'Aayirathil Oruvan'.

2425
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,320
Mother, take this.

2426
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:01,800
MGR has said that
she must remain in the party.

2427
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:04,600
Hello, sir.

2428
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:06,000
Hello. Please sit.

2429
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,640
My name is Rajan.

2430
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,160
I know.
I've heard all about you.

2431
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,600
I'm not as bad as they say.

2432
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:14,520
No. I've only heard good things.

2433
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,200
I smuggle goods for the traders
in the Bazaar.

2434
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:20,880
- So I've heard.
- But it's all in the past.

2435
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:22,200
Tell me.

2436
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:25,280
I've been feeling, off-late...

2437
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:28,200
- What?
- He's wet from the rain.

2438
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:34,360
I saw your daughter
when she came by to the temple.

2439
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:36,120
I really like her.

2440
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:41,760
It won't be nice if this goes on in public.
So I thought I'd talk to you.

2441
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:47,880
I'd like to spend the rest of my life
with your granddaughter.

2442
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:50,360
This is why I told you
not to send her out of the house...

2443
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:53,720
I would have sent my parents
to talk to you...

2444
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,320
But I don't have any.

2445
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,840
It's just me and my brother.

2446
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:59,560
I don't know if the whole town
will call me a good man

2447
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:02,360
But to my conscience,
I have never wronged anybody.

2448
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:05,400
Will you get your daughter
married to me?

2449
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:14,320
Marry her.

2450
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:16,880
He said okay.

2451
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:21,720
I don't know how to react,
you agreed so easily

2452
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:22,840
I'm...

2453
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,960
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you!

2454
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:28,080
I'm at a loss for words...

2455
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:31,200
When someone like you asks,
can an ordinary man like me refuse?

2456
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:32,640
I can only agree.

2457
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,800
If it had Ben anyone else
in your place

2458
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,920
I'd have thrashed
him for having...

2459
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,840
the audacity to ask for
my daughter's hand.

2460
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:40,920
Now Rajan has landed
at my doorstep though.

2461
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,240
What choice do I have?
Marry her.

2462
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:44,600
Father...

2463
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,760
I wish to marry him, too.

2464
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:48,800
He'll take good care of me
until the very end.

2465
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:49,320
Trust

2466
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,640
Shut up!

2467
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:52,120
What happened?

2468
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:53,320
Go to the kitchen.

2469
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,160
Chandra is your daughter.

2470
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:56,760
That's not going to change.

2471
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:00,120
If you don't get her married to me,
that's your call.

2472
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:03,240
But don't you dare
do something like that again...

2473
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:04,800
I'll kill you.

2474
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:07,000
And that's why I'm scared
to let you marry my daughter.

2475
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:08,320
No, Father-in-Law...

2476
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,600
I didn't communicate properly

2477
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:15,040
My brother and I grew up alone.

2478
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:18,720
I'm not just here to ask to
marry your daughter.

2479
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,760
I came asking to be
part of your family.

2480
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:25,200
But I don't wish to break your family
and take her away to live with me.

2481
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:27,200
Get us married if you change your mind.

2482
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:29,360
Chandra, you see that guy
in the red shawl?

2483
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:30,720
He's my uncle.

2484
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:34,120
Serve them some meat.

2485
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,720
I'll drink it straight
from the pack.

2486
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:38,240
Congratulations.

2487
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:40,680
Ramesh, you are giving me a gift
from the bribe I gave you?

2488
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:42,040
That's from my salary!

2489
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,000
Let's take a photo.

2490
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,840
She's left her family for you.
Take good care of her.

2491
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,120
I'll take such good care of her,
the whole hood will get jealous.

2492
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:53,160
She's your guardian angel.

2493
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,600
Obey her words, always.

2494
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:59,440
"Taking sword on hand
you are cutting candies now"

2495
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:05,880
"If allows, you come
and make this land of yours"

2496
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:39,320
Here.

2497
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:40,440
Eat up!

2498
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:41,560
That's enough.

2499
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:42,680
This food tastes great!

2500
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:44,880
How I wish I'd find a girl
to cook like this for me.

2501
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:47,400
"You are putting crossing"

2502
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:49,880
"My life is hanging around you"

2503
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:53,040
"What mesmerise did you do to me, my dear?"

2504
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:57,920
Brother!

2505
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,960
The police have entered our hood.
You go into the sea, we'll handle it.

2506
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,560
They're raiding all our homes.

2507
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:05,880
- Hope our boys aren't there.
- No, they've all gone to the sea.

2508
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,640
They'll create a ruckus
if we displace all of them...

2509
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,960
We can't be bothered
about 50 huts here.

2510
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,640
The Government has its own priorities.

2511
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:19,560
Try to control the protests.
Arrest people if needed.

2512
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:20,600
Greetings!

2513
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,080
Officer, what's this about?

2514
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:23,200
Control Room?

2515
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:24,400
Rajan...

2516
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:27,240
Everything is under control.
Inform Mic 10.

2517
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:28,960
It will be done
in 10 minutes.

2518
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,960
Muthu has filed a complaint
that you have liquor in the hood.

2519
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,560
They're going to
destroy your boats.

2520
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,680
Only I sell liquor in our hood.

2521
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:38,560
Destroy my boat and arrest me.
Spare the people.

2522
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:39,800
What can I do?

2523
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,120
Come here

2524
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:44,760
The government is bringing in schemes
for people's welfare...

2525
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,920
you're preventing it so that
you can continue smuggling?

2526
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,840
You are destroying our boats
only to chase the people away.

2527
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,840
You aren't fooling anyone.

2528
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:58,760
If my people get agitated, it won't
matter whether you're a cop or not.

2529
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:00,280
They will strip and humiliate you.

2530
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:04,000
You tiny little wimp!

2531
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:06,320
Dare to mess with me?

2532
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:09,120
You're lecturing me?

2533
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:10,400
You don't know me.

2534
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,560
It's the tiny anchor that holds
the massive ship in place.

2535
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:19,560
Thinks he's a big-shot
in his khaki uniform.

2536
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:22,560
Ramesh, get your people out of here.

2537
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:23,720
Be patient, Rajan...

2538
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,760
If you attack a cop,
you'll be in serious trouble.

2539
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:28,880
Come on!

2540
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:31,400
All this time, the people prospered
because of you.

2541
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:33,600
Now they'll be reduced to nothing
because of you.

2542
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,040
Strip his uniform
and take him into the sea.

2543
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:41,040
You have only dealt with corrupt cops
who work for your bribe.

2544
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:45,120
You've not come across someone like me,
who's put on this uniform out of passion.

2545
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:46,800
Mark my words.

2546
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,520
No matter how many years it takes...

2547
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:51,640
I'll be the reason behind your deaths.

2548
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:53,720
You'll be in service
for only 20 more years.

2549
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,400
The person might change,
the uniform will stay.

2550
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:58,280
That's why we have
undressed you, don't you get it?

2551
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:01,360
I told you, we should drown him
and get it over with.

2552
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:04,160
Let's wait for the negotiations.

2553
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:05,920
If it fails,
we'll drown him.

2554
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:08,200
Go closer to the launch

2555
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:16,280
Hey...go faster

2556
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:19,240
Anchor your boat.

2557
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,600
The officials want to know
your demands.

2558
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:25,480
Sir, try to acquiesce to his demands
till we get the Assistant Commissioner back.

2559
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:28,600
Rajan, he is a man in uniform.
Don't do anything to him.

2560
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:30,640
Men in uniform should
work for the people.

2561
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:34,480
But you work for the politicians
and businessmen.

2562
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:37,720
Give up your hood.
They'd give you anything you want.

2563
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:41,040
Ramesh, don't ever
try to buy me out.

2564
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:45,000
Give it to me in writing
that you will cease the evacuation.

2565
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:47,280
Or your A.C. stays with me.

2566
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:48,680
Sir, we can't negotiate with him.

2567
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:51,600
We need to agree to his demands
if we want the A.C. alive.

2568
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,920
They have dropped the evacuation plan.
We won!

2569
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:01,600
'Even though it happened
many years ago...'

2570
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:04,280
'the people still talk about how Rajan
chased the police away.'

2571
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:07,160
'and stopped the hood
from being evacuated.'

2572
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:10,920
We shouldn't allow any politicians
to enter our hood anymore.

2573
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:12,480
We will take care
of ourselves.

2574
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:15,280
Let's first build a club
for the next generation.

2575
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:18,280
'Rajan kept all the politicians
out of the hood after that.'

2576
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,920
'It was a problem for all the Parties.'

2577
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:21,160
Who is that leader of yours?

2578
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:23,800
'They could come back in
only if Rajan died.'

2579
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:26,600
'They were waiting for
the right opportunity to kill him.'

2580
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:28,640
He said he'd have been happy
to inaugurate it.

2581
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:32,160
Senthil, they expect clubs
to be affiliated to some political party.

2582
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:33,920
Don't get into this.

2583
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:35,040
No such thing.

2584
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:37,320
I'm coming, love.
You miss your husband?

2585
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:39,680
You're keeping them waiting.
- Don't be mad, I'm coming.

2586
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,280
- Marie, are you well?
- I'm fine.

2587
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:43,640
All India Radio news,
presented by Rajaram.

2588
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:48,880
Breaking news : Tamil Nadu's Chief
Minister, MGR, just passed away.

2589
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:50,600
He was seventy years old...

2590
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:53,840
'Muthu got the opportunity he was
waiting for, when MGR died.'

2591
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,360
Go fetch Velu!

2592
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:59,000
An official announcement has been made
that he passed away in his Ramapuram house.

2593
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:06,440
- Have you got the posters?
- It'll be here in an hour.

2594
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:10,160
Put them up when you get it.
I'll go see the leader one last time.

2595
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:13,280
Yes. Muthu said we could go with him.

2596
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:16,280
Why should we go with him?
Let's go by ourselves.

2597
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,800
...brought his corpse
to Chennai Rajaji Hall

2598
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:22,080
'Public and politicians have come
and paid their last respects'

2599
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:28,000
'When Rajan had gone to see MGR's body,
Muthu sent Senthil to smuggle in the sea.'

2600
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:33,800
'Senthil took Rajan's boys
and went in...'

2601
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:37,640
'Muthu tipped off the police
and had them arrested.'

2602
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:41,080
I told you not to smuggle now!

2603
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:45,320
'For the first time, Rajan lost his temper
with his men for disobeying him.'

2604
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:47,240
The whole state is in grief.

2605
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:49,640
There is demand for booze.

2606
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:52,760
The people are desperate
for some good booze now.

2607
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:58,360
Muthu said if we do this one job,
we can make a lot of money and settle down.

2608
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:01,520
You listen to him now?
Those young boys are in police custody.

2609
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:03,400
He sent you to smuggle
to get back at me...

2610
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:04,880
and got our boys
caught red handed.

2611
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:05,960
They're looking for us.

2612
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,760
If we get caught, they'll bring up
old records and frame new ones.

2613
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,320
Please try to resolve this
without getting us booked.

2614
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:13,400
You went to work without me.
Now deal with this mess on your own.

2615
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:16,080
So you'll never
let us work on our own?

2616
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:18,680
You've landed us in trouble
because you went to work alone.

2617
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:20,160
If you want to, do it right.

2618
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,320
If you'd waited a little longer,
I'd have set it up for you.

2619
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:23,800
We've waited for far too long,
in your shadows...

2620
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:25,560
to no avail.
- Don't talk back at him.

2621
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:27,080
Why can't we be in control, too?

2622
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:28,680
Watch your words.

2623
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:30,040
Get out.

2624
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:32,680
Get out.

2625
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:36,120
But I never went with them.

2626
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,560
Get lost.

2627
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:40,320
I don't mind
you are my sibling

2628
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:43,720
Five of you got beaten up
by one man?

2629
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:44,760
Have you no shame?

2630
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,400
The people are on his side.

2631
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:49,640
We did as you told.

2632
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:51,280
But without Rajan's support...

2633
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:52,720
To hell with Rajan!

2634
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:54,840
Like he's some big-shot.

2635
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,560
He was a nobody.

2636
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:58,680
I made him who he is.

2637
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:02,800
Just say the word,
and I'll make you, too.

2638
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:06,000
I don't think
that will work, Leader.

2639
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:07,200
There's Guna, too.

2640
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:09,360
Rope him in, then.

2641
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,640
Guna is very loyal to Rajan.

2642
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:14,440
Only fools are loyal.

2643
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:15,600
Guna is no fool.

2644
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:17,200
Is it so bad
that I want to be somebody, too?

2645
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:19,960
Rajan has made enough money
and is set for life.

2646
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,640
He lives in a concrete house
with a beautiful woman.

2647
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,840
We've got nothing.
Now he's thrown us out, too.

2648
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,480
Young boys from the hood
have been caught in the case.

2649
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:28,680
He just hit you
in a fit of rage.

2650
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:30,680
He may be your brother,
but hear me out...

2651
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:33,560
After he got married,
he made you move out and live in a hut.

2652
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:35,440
To him, we're all dispensable.

2653
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:36,920
He doesn't care.

2654
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:40,120
We just need to talk it out with him.
Come on, let's go.

2655
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:41,600
He said we can't even
enter our hood!

2656
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:43,400
We don't want to be humiliated again.

2657
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:44,720
Come brother

2658
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:49,880
Come in, boy.
Chandra serve him dinner.

2659
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:51,120
It's okay.

2660
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,040
Looks like Senthil met Muthu.

2661
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:56,960
I'm worried his influence
might lead them to more trouble.

2662
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,360
You should talk to them.

2663
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,200
- Dear...
- Yes?

2664
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:02,080
I feel something fishy

2665
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:03,280
Can't you go
in the morning?

2666
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:06,240
The boys are upset
that I hit them in front of everyone.

2667
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,040
I feel bad about it.

2668
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:11,480
If I go to the hotel and tell them
it's all sorted...

2669
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:14,760
and that the police will
leave them alone...

2670
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:16,280
they will feel better, too.

2671
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:17,800
Come back soon.

2672
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:33,000
You go in.

2673
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:35,000
Greetings

2674
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:36,680
Senthil...

2675
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:38,440
What's going on?

2676
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,280
- I'm talking.
- Carry on.

2677
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:41,960
Pazhani, let's go in.
Why are you standing here?

2678
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,200
I'm not coming in.

2679
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:45,160
Guna...

2680
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:47,160
What's all this?

2681
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:48,960
This isn't ours.

2682
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,400
Why have you put bottles
from other tables here?

2683
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:55,000
You're upset
because I hit you?

2684
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:56,880
That makes no difference.

2685
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:58,760
The humiliation won't go away.

2686
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:01,400
Senthil, I'd understand
if the others didn't get it...

2687
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,600
but do you not understand?

2688
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:04,880
It's not uncommon for goods
to be seized.

2689
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:07,200
But all this time, the
cops have come to us...

2690
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:09,920
and we chose which
goods are seized.

2691
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:13,480
We called all the shots:
The case, the men, the goods.

2692
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:14,520
That's how it should be.

2693
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:17,560
When we are doing this work
the people should be on our side.

2694
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:19,600
They should be assured that we will
take care of them.

2695
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:21,600
You could have taken us into the house
and spoken to us.

2696
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:23,320
You hit us in front of wife and children.

2697
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:24,680
You know you can't handle it.

2698
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:26,040
Why do you drink...?

2699
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:27,040
Sit here.

2700
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:29,040
Thambi...

2701
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:30,680
Get him a soda.

2702
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:33,000
If I had taken you inside the house
to discuss this...

2703
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:36,120
...the boys who got arrested
would have taken arms against you.

2704
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:38,720
- Get me a soda.
- We've run out of soda.

2705
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:39,640
He asked for you.

2706
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:41,320
They drink liquor and vomit
we buy soda, crap!

2707
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:42,160
Tell him to buy somewhere

2708
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:44,120
It will take a few days
to clear the boys' records.

2709
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:46,520
Meanwhile, you shouldn't be seen
trotting around the hood.

2710
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:48,840
It will only anger their family.

2711
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:52,640
While the boys are in prison,
they should know you're being punished too.

2712
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:53,800
That's why threw you out.

2713
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:55,240
I've spoken to Ramesh.

2714
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:56,840
Once the boys are out...

2715
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:58,400
I'll make arrangements for you
to start on your own.

2716
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:00,000
You can work with freedom.

2717
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:02,960
Is that fine, Jawa?

2718
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,560
I'm fine if Senthil is fine.

2719
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:09,320
- Why do you say that?
- Senthil knows best. I don't...

2720
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:12,800
Looks like you've got yourself
a disciple, Senthil?

2721
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:15,000
No such thing.
We're all your boys.

2722
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:18,000
If you keep depending on Senthil,
when will you think for yourself?

2723
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:19,800
When the time comes...

2724
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:23,960
You hit me in front of
my wife and kids.

2725
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,880
Will my children have any respect for me?

2726
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:28,960
Muthu is misleading you.
I had to fix it.

2727
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:30,360
Fool!

2728
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:32,880
He's talking to us
and you want to kill him?

2729
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:35,080
He's spoken to the police for us.

2730
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,880
I know about him

2731
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:38,720
That's just empty talk.

2732
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:41,240
It doesn't matter.
Let's not do anything now.

2733
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:42,480
Guna, we'll never
get another opportunity.

2734
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:44,520
You don't do this because
you have an opportunity.

2735
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:47,320
We thought something else.
But he's helping us...!

2736
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:48,680
He will not.

2737
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:50,240
Let's go ahead as planned.

2738
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:51,320
I want the plan aborted.

2739
02:05:52,360 --> 02:05:55,600
We've plotted against the mighty Rajan.
The day he gets to know about this...

2740
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:56,880
How would he get to know?

2741
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:58,560
You think
he wouldn't know?

2742
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:00,880
He's already prepared to wipe us out.
Thambi would have surely informed.

2743
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:02,280
- Senthil!
- Yes

2744
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:03,040
Come

2745
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:05,000
- Velu is puking again...
- Should I come?

2746
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:07,520
- We'll handle it.
- His wife will be pissed.

2747
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:10,280
Senthil, this is wrong.
Let's stop it.

2748
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:19,560
Stop peeping!

2749
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:21,720
The daggers are under the table.
If he spots it...

2750
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:23,960
I wish he would.
We can see who survives.

2751
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,880
- I'm scared, Senthil.
- I'm scared, too.

2752
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:28,320
Which is why we should
get it over with.

2753
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:29,960
No, Senthil. No.

2754
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,880
Velu, this is not right.

2755
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:32,800
Guna, this is wrong.

2756
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:33,920
How?

2757
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:35,640
You're wrong.

2758
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:36,840
Don't shout.

2759
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:42,000
I'm out. Do whatever you want.

2760
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:43,880
Guna!

2761
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:48,880
Senthil, I'm worried
about your silence.

2762
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:50,760
He said he can't do

2763
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,640
You won't allow me
to do anything as earlier

2764
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:54,400
Better you find a girl and marry her

2765
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:55,680
Then everything will be alright

2766
02:06:55,720 --> 02:06:58,760
I will think about my marriage
after I get settled like you

2767
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:01,560
Is Velu still throwing up?

2768
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:02,720
He'll come now, brother

2769
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:05,680
Join in politics,
you will get settled soon

2770
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:07,920
That won't work for me
He is only going...

2771
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,200
Senthil, I know that
If you want to join in politics...

2772
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:13,480
Listen to me.

2773
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:15,040
Stop going behind Muthu.

2774
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:17,200
He knows nothing.
Pass me a cigarette.

2775
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:20,160
He claims Janaki or Nedunchezhiyan
will come to power next.

2776
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:24,480
I tell you, it's going to be
Jayalalitha who succeeds MGR.

2777
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:25,680
How so?

2778
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:29,440
R.M.V and Nedunchezhiyan are seniors.

2779
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:32,000
Yes, but they are becoming old

2780
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,680
There's Thirunavukkarasu.
He's an youngster.

2781
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:36,880
He's the one who'll make
Jayalalitha a superpower.

2782
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:42,000
The seniors made the mistake of pushing
Jayalalitha off the funeral hearse in public.

2783
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:44,480
You know, the MGR is not dead yet.

2784
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:46,960
- What's this new story?
- Not too many people know this.

2785
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:50,560
The watch in his hand
is made in America.

2786
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:52,680
It is connected to his heart.
It stops only when his heart beat stops...

2787
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:54,560
The watch is still working.

2788
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:55,720
How do you know?

2789
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:59,880
Our boys have heard it
in his tomb. It's ticking away.

2790
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:01,480
Don't blabber, Guna.

2791
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:04,360
He's is trying to find out
who's loyal to him.

2792
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,800
Guna has backed out.

2793
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:10,280
If you're truly interested in politics,
quit hanging out with this fool.

2794
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:14,520
You're calling me a fool now?
When he comes back...

2795
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:28,800
What's this?

2796
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:33,520
You've set this up to kill me?

2797
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:38,440
Chandra told me not to go.

2798
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:40,560
I didn't listen.

2799
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:43,240
I have to see my brothers
in this light...?

2800
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:44,280
For this...

2801
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:45,440
He's going for his weapon!

2802
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:46,560
Senthil!

2803
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:49,320
We decided not to...
Why did you stab him?

2804
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:50,400
He was going for his weapon.

2805
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:51,960
He's not carrying any weapon!

2806
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,760
You're making a terrible mistake...

2807
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:54,880
Go

2808
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:08,240
What happened to you, Senthil?

2809
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:09,440
Guna...

2810
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:10,680
Velu...

2811
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:13,200
This wasn't our plan.
We decided not to do but...

2812
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,400
Careful!

2813
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:19,120
Don't let him go!
Or he'll kill us.

2814
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:22,680
I'll take care of you

2815
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:24,240
Don't just stand there!

2816
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:26,360
I said don't do it,
then why do you...?

2817
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,520
Velu, hold him tight!
Your hand will get in the way.

2818
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:30,760
We toil hard,
but you get everything?

2819
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:32,600
I don't want a better life
with this murder

2820
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:35,800
Sorry brother!
If we let go you, you'll kill me

2821
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:39,720
Listen to me!

2822
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:43,280
Hey, what are you doing there?

2823
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:46,640
I'll kill you along with him

2824
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:48,240
He came to talk you
But you killed him

2825
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:50,640
Wait, I will join in harbour
and kill you all

2826
02:09:50,680 --> 02:09:54,560
Hang in there,
we'll take you to the hospital.

2827
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:57,120
Thambi, they were hasty.
You need to be patient.

2828
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:58,040
Don't tell like that

2829
02:09:58,080 --> 02:10:00,560
Lets finish here
You leave them

2830
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:04,000
It's okay...
Just don't tell Chandra they killed me.

2831
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:05,200
She can't handle it.

2832
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:06,560
Go man

2833
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:08,640
Already they stabbed him
He is breathing his last

2834
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:10,560
Senthil, without me...
politicians like Muthu will use you...

2835
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:13,200
for their motives
and destroy you.

2836
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:15,960
You know nothing.

2837
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:16,920
I beg you

2838
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:18,400
You were too hasty, Senthil.

2839
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:20,680
Guna...

2840
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:23,720
You actually thought I would
try to kill you?

2841
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:26,000
You were my whole world--

2842
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:29,440
We can't see you in this situation
Go die, brother

2843
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:41,320
Don't make him quiver
Stab him correctly

2844
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:45,040
Sister-in-law!

2845
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:54,800
Brother...!

2846
02:10:58,360 --> 02:11:00,520
You promised to bring him back.

2847
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:02,000
But I've failed.

2848
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:19,680
'Move...give way

2849
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:27,680
He's here.
They've brought him here.

2850
02:11:27,720 --> 02:11:28,880
Come and see him.

2851
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:33,200
"If we were aware
it would happen like this..."

2852
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:47,880
"If we were aware
it would happen like this..."

2853
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:52,240
"We would make a plea to God
to save him alive"

2854
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:57,800
"All you remain there
have to lead a life alone"

2855
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:02,000
"All you remain there
have to lead a life alone"

2856
02:12:02,040 --> 02:12:05,280
"Till now he lived
a king's life in Kasimedu"

2857
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:07,080
Why don't you talk to me?

2858
02:12:07,120 --> 02:12:09,760
Won't you at least yell at me?

2859
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:12,080
Oh God! Sister-in-law!

2860
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:18,800
"How do I endure this loss?
My heart aches."

2861
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:25,640
Our protector has left us all behind.

2862
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:29,400
Who would look after us now?

2863
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:32,640
Look at him lying there.

2864
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:38,160
We've been orphaned!

2865
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:44,040
Sister-in-law! We can't bear this!

2866
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:58,000
She is wearing the glasses
for my brother

2867
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:01,200
Rajan brother!

2868
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:03,760
Our lion is gone!

2869
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:06,640
Who would look after us now?

2870
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:12,240
You said you'd always
stay by my side.

2871
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:14,800
But now you're gone?

2872
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:17,480
What will I do now?

2873
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:19,960
Where will I go?

2874
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:21,960
Answer me.

2875
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,800
I'm talking to you.

2876
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:32,920
Your friend Ramesh is here.

2877
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,720
Open your eyes and see!

2878
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:38,360
Chandra, Rajan was a good man.
We shouldn't spare his killers.

2879
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:42,240
If you should ever need anything,
you can call upon me like a brother.

2880
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:03,520
Chandra...

2881
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:05,680
You must cry, Chandra.
Don't bottle it up.

2882
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:07,520
Why should I cry?

2883
02:14:08,360 --> 02:14:12,040
Those who killed my husband
are well and happy.

2884
02:14:13,160 --> 02:14:17,200
They all called him their Brother,
but got together to kill him.

2885
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:27,960
My dear...

2886
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:33,120
I will divide them from within,
make them stand alone.

2887
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:35,760
And I will make them betray
and kill each other.

2888
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:39,320
Only when the last of them is dead,
I will cry, my dearest.

2889
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:46,680
Anbu realised that his life has
changed with the death of Rajan

2890
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:58,400
'That death, Rajan's death chased Anbu'

2891
02:14:59,720 --> 02:15:04,800
'The town people thought they don't
have no one for them after Rajan's death'

2892
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:07,520
'His friends who were with Rajan
moved away from him'

2893
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:09,440
'But people didn't forget him'

2894
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:12,200
'When they were with Rajan'
for what they were protesting...

2895
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:14,960
'they are doing the same
against the people'

2896
02:15:15,120 --> 02:15:18,840
Guna knows I owe him everything,
and wants me to stand against the people.

2897
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,600
They want me to betray my friend.

2898
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,240
I'd rather die
than betray him.

2899
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:23,760
Don't break your head over that.

2900
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:26,640
Do whatever feels right to you.

2901
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:29,080
Don't think over it.

2902
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:32,240
The next petitioner - Poondi
Thangammal street, Pallam

2903
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:35,040
Hameed got a court order that temporarily
stays the road construction.

2904
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:36,720
This is a central government scheme.

2905
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:38,960
It will be beneficial to everyone.

2906
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:40,400
Tell me, how?

2907
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:43,680
A few men from each locality
will get a government job.

2908
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:47,320
You'll take away the only job we've known
and give us a job we don't know?

2909
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:50,360
Hameed, you've got yourself
a fancy bank job.

2910
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:52,600
You know nothing about the suffering
of others in the hood.

2911
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:55,640
We all know your friend Anbu
is a top class player.

2912
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:57,800
Just his luck, he didn't get
the kind of education you did.

2913
02:15:57,840 --> 02:15:59,200
What does he do for a living?

2914
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:01,800
With this road construction, if he gets
a government job at the harbour...

2915
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:03,800
more kids will look at him
and start playing carom.

2916
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,200
They'll get government jobs, too.

2917
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:07,000
We don't have to depend on the sea.

2918
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:09,560
This is how we gradually develop a nation.

2919
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:12,280
Tearing down our homes
will develop the nation?

2920
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:17,800
You set up this meeting to make us
retract our petition...

2921
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:19,760
and you promise to build us new homes.

2922
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:21,760
Why didn't you meet us
before you auctioned this project?

2923
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:23,480
If we'd refused in the first place...

2924
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:25,360
you people couldn't have
made your cut.

2925
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:27,760
You went ahead and made these
decisions on our behalf...

2926
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:30,200
made a lot of money
from the auction...

2927
02:16:30,240 --> 02:16:32,560
now you promise us homes
to cover up your monkey business.

2928
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:34,520
What does that mean?

2929
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,720
Can't understand

2930
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:40,000
You don't even understand our dialect.
How will you understand our lives...

2931
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:41,600
or improve it?

2932
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:43,520
We're educated, qualified professionals.

2933
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:45,960
Does education make you
understand and empathise?

2934
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:50,360
If you did, you wouldn't take a fisherman
miles away from the ocean...

2935
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:52,240
and re-settle him in Kannagi Nagar.

2936
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:54,640
You take away the only trade
we've ever known.

2937
02:16:54,680 --> 02:16:57,640
When the police need to frame a record,
they go these hoods first.

2938
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:59,600
These areas are known
as criminal hubs.

2939
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:02,360
Is it the people's fault, or yours,
for not planning sustainable cities?

2940
02:17:02,400 --> 02:17:04,760
Officers may come and go.

2941
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:06,040
I'm always here for our people.

2942
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:09,400
I'll find solutions from the Center
for all of our people's problems.

2943
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:12,400
We can excuse these officers,
since they don't know our lives.

2944
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:14,400
But people like you are scary.

2945
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:15,440
You sell us out.

2946
02:17:15,480 --> 02:17:17,040
Anbu, he's no outsider.

2947
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:19,560
He speaks on behalf of our people.
Don't disrespect him.

2948
02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:20,680
You're crossing a line, Anbu.

2949
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:21,840
What can I do?

2950
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:23,360
I wish you'd spoken for us.

2951
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:26,560
We would have stood behind you.

2952
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:29,800
But you threaten to kill
those who stand up for our hood.

2953
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:30,680
Anbu...

2954
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:32,520
You're forgetting your place.

2955
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:35,800
Just listen to what the authorities say.
Its better for everyone.

2956
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:37,240
By everyone, you mean...

2957
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:38,960
the people sitting there?

2958
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,400
Watch your words!

2959
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:42,480
Velu, let's resolve this.

2960
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:45,760
Anbu, there's no point to
what you're doing now.

2961
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:47,640
I'm telling you,
I've been in your place.

2962
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:49,760
Really?
What did you do?

2963
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:50,760
What did they do?

2964
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:53,120
They murdered Rajan
who stood up for our hood.

2965
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:55,280
They haven't stepped in the shanty
in fifteen years.

2966
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:58,200
- They'll sell us all out.
- I'm warning you, kid...

2967
02:17:58,240 --> 02:17:59,760
I'm trying to be civil.

2968
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:01,760
- Or what?
- I'll kill you all!

2969
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:04,160
Don't harass boys when they're
standing up for their hood!

2970
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:04,880
Go on, son.

2971
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:06,040
Why don't you understand?

2972
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:07,920
You'll get steady jobs.
Better standards--

2973
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:09,200
Tell me the truth.

2974
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:11,520
Is this road even being laid
for our people?

2975
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,160
You're just trying to take away
whatever we have left.

2976
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:15,800
And you use us to do that, too.

2977
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:19,160
You collect rent for dumping garbage
in the rivers we grew up on.

2978
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:21,000
Sure, you give us jobs there.

2979
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:22,960
But these men die of infections
every other day.

2980
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:26,600
When we question you,
you use our own men to threaten us.

2981
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:27,960
You get the police to thrash us.

2982
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,800
This has become a habit for you.

2983
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:31,160
Don't misunderstand me, brother.

2984
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:33,200
They're using people like you
to ruin our hood.

2985
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:35,640
Should we run away from our homes
to benefit them?

2986
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:37,480
Save your stories
for someone else.

2987
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:39,920
We're staying.
They can lay their roads over us.

2988
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:45,040
If you truly care about our people,
improve our lives in our own homes.

2989
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:46,760
That's how you develop a nation.

2990
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:54,120
I only spoke for our hood.

2991
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:55,840
I didn't mean to disrespect you.

2992
02:18:55,880 --> 02:18:57,920
We must not let down our own hood.

2993
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:06,200
All this time, when Hameed mentioned
getting a stay on the construction...

2994
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:08,320
I thought, the government
will do the right thing always.

2995
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:11,160
They're destroying a whole village
to benefit a few men.

2996
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:12,720
We can't let anyone do that to us.

2997
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:14,440
We're not politicians.
They'll say--

2998
02:19:14,480 --> 02:19:16,120
They'll say we're rowdies.

2999
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:18,520
If self-defence is rowdyism...

3000
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:20,560
then let's engage in rowdyism.

3001
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:24,840
They want to shift us like cattle from
our ancestral homes to a random place.

3002
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:27,080
We must not put up with that.

3003
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:29,200
We may have our differences.

3004
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:31,600
But let's set that aside
and stand together.

3005
02:19:31,640 --> 02:19:33,120
Let's see what they can do.

3006
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:35,080
It's one thing to face problems
from our foes.

3007
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:38,640
We can't deal with problems
from our own boys.

3008
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:39,600
This is wrong.

3009
02:19:39,640 --> 02:19:41,440
He's one of ours.
What can we do?

3010
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:43,320
Let Senthil's brother-in-law handle him.

3011
02:19:43,360 --> 02:19:44,240
That's unfair.

3012
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:45,160
You don't understand.

3013
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:46,680
Don't do this.
Listen to me.

3014
02:19:46,720 --> 02:19:48,960
He humiliated me in
front of the village.

3015
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:51,040
You're taking his side
instead of worrying about me?

3016
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:53,240
Guna refused to hear you out.
What could I possibly do?

3017
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,600
I don't need you to speak to Guna.

3018
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:57,360
I need you to stand up for Anbu.

3019
02:19:57,400 --> 02:20:00,680
Anbu will avenge those
who murdered my husband.

3020
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:03,080
You still want to avenge him?

3021
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:05,760
After being married to Guna
for all these years?

3022
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,640
I look like a whore to you?

3023
02:20:10,240 --> 02:20:12,400
I am Rajan's wife.

3024
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:18,360
Every time I slept with Guna,
I fantasised about my revenge.

3025
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:21,720
But I didn't know
where to begin, or how.

3026
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:25,360
I set up men to kill Guna
at the procession.

3027
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:29,680
If any of you get caught,
tell them Senthil sent you.

3028
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:30,720
We can't afford a miss.

3029
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:33,720
Guna's life was saved that day
because Anbu got in the way.

3030
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:35,400
I was angry with Anbu then.

3031
02:20:35,440 --> 02:20:38,160
There was a reason
that Guna didn't die that night

3032
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:40,520
Chandra, whatever you think,
nothing will happen

3033
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:43,400
They must answer
for my husband's death

3034
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:45,760
Only if Guna is alive
your wish will get fulfilled

3035
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:48,320
Next day Guna came to meet me

3036
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:50,640
I feel so pity
to see you in this situation

3037
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:53,760
I understood after he talked to me

3038
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:55,520
There's some money in this.

3039
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,640
So I realised... Guna shouldn't be
the first to die.

3040
02:20:57,680 --> 02:20:59,040
He must be the last to die.

3041
02:20:59,080 --> 02:21:02,560
I understood if he is with me
I can kill others easily

3042
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:05,600
That day itself I could kill him
mixing poison in his food

3043
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:08,760
If he had died that day,
how would I kill the others?

3044
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:12,440
I can do what I think
with the love Guna showed to me

3045
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:14,720
I decided to live with him

3046
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:17,640
Guna and Senthil had an on-going
truce for five years...

3047
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:20,920
I didn't know what to do
to make them fight

3048
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:23,520
when Anbu killed 'Jawa' Pazhani.

3049
02:21:23,560 --> 02:21:26,000
I made Guna turn his brother in.

3050
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:27,480
Confirm?

3051
02:21:27,560 --> 02:21:31,120
If Sundar and Thambi go to the jail
Senthil can't do anything,as Guna thinks

3052
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:33,680
I used my boys
to tell that to Senthil

3053
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:37,080
Boss, twenty men have
turned themselves into the police.

3054
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:39,120
Guna's brother Sankar
has given written statement.

3055
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:41,400
I'll turn myself in
for the VOC Nagar murder.

3056
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:42,880
I'll finish him off inside the prison.

3057
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:45,320
I thought they will fight
each other and die

3058
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:48,320
But Senthil called for a truce
when he wanted to enter politics.

3059
02:21:48,360 --> 02:21:50,200
To be a slave to some politician-

3060
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:52,680
Guna and Velu were ready to take it.

3061
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:59,240
I had Ramesh tell Guna that their names
have been included in the encounter list.

3062
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:00,240
What can I do?

3063
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:01,440
They fell for it.

3064
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:04,960
Guna only sent Anbu to get Senthil
out of his block.

3065
02:22:05,320 --> 02:22:07,360
But it was Anbu who stabbed Senthil.

3066
02:22:07,400 --> 02:22:11,720
He would be the one to finish off
everyone who killed my husband.

3067
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:14,600
I have to make sure
that he doesn't face any obstacles.

3068
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:18,440
If Guna and Velu be together
it will be a harm to Anbu's life

3069
02:22:18,480 --> 02:22:19,320
Leave him

3070
02:22:19,360 --> 02:22:20,200
Why are you beating him?

3071
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:21,560
He peeped when my wife
was inside the bathroom

3072
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,240
- Don't lie
- He said, no

3073
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:24,840
- Then, is she lied?
- You ask her

3074
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:26,560
My brother won't lie
Get lost

3075
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:29,600
For this time, no danger
will come to Anbu by Guna and Velu

3076
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:30,800
Don't worry
I'll take care

3077
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:33,160
Dear, I can't stay in this town

3078
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:35,680
Tonight I will make Guna
to vacate the house

3079
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:58,800
These men have pledged their loyalty
to avenge my husband.

3080
02:22:59,360 --> 02:23:03,040
They've waited by my side
waiting for the right time.

3081
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:06,840
If Senthil won't listen,
use them to handle Kumar.

3082
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:10,000
If he doesn't get harmed
by Guna and Velu...

3083
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,120
White

3084
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:00,000
Kill him

3085
02:24:28,480 --> 02:24:29,680
Kannan, turn off the lights.

3086
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:30,640
Anbu!

3087
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:35,160
We've come to help you, Anbu.

3088
02:24:35,960 --> 02:24:37,600
Come with us if you believe us.

3089
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:46,880
Only you.

3090
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:47,880
Let him wait here.

3091
02:24:48,360 --> 02:24:49,240
I'll be back.

3092
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:02,440
Go on.

3093
02:25:02,480 --> 02:25:04,080
Why did you speak against Guna?

3094
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:05,960
I didn't speak against anyone.

3095
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:07,480
I only spoke for my people.

3096
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:08,800
Even Guna understands.

3097
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:11,680
If he did, why has he sent men
to kill you?

3098
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:13,760
They've sold you out.

3099
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:17,160
Guna has told Kumar that
you were the one to stab Senthil.

3100
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:20,960
Kumar is out to kill you
to reclaim their clout in the hood.

3101
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,680
My boys will take you to a safe-house.

3102
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:25,560
Why should I run away from them?

3103
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:26,560
I'm a sportsman.

3104
02:25:26,600 --> 02:25:27,960
Then play your game.

3105
02:25:28,280 --> 02:25:30,840
Why should you take on
the burden of people's issues?

3106
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,280
If you want to live the life
you wish for, go away.

3107
02:25:33,320 --> 02:25:37,040
When people leave their homes, it's with
the faith that they can return someday.

3108
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:39,560
If there will be no home to return to,
where does one go?

3109
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:42,160
Be it a dump-yard or a slum...
this is our home.

3110
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:44,600
We must fight for it.
We must develop it.

3111
02:25:44,640 --> 02:25:47,240
They slaughter men who speak this way.

3112
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:50,520
This war doesn't end
with one man's death.

3113
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:54,360
We fight back just to show them
that we have it in us, too.

3114
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:57,360
Win or lose, we must fight.

3115
02:25:57,800 --> 02:26:00,640
If we don't fight back,
they'll continue to run us down.

3116
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:02,280
But now they will--

3117
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:03,400
Kill me?

3118
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:04,440
Right?

3119
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:07,840
I've stood up against big-shots.
I've hindered rich and powerful men.

3120
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:09,720
They will kill me wherever I go.

3121
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:11,680
If they want to kill me...

3122
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:14,360
they will have to do it
in my hood.

3123
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:16,400
At least everyone will know
why I was killed.

3124
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:18,800
These words... I feel like
I've heard them before.

3125
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:19,960
He's not here now.

3126
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:23,000
Kumar is hiring 30 men

3127
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:25,360
To finish you off by tonight

3128
02:26:25,400 --> 02:26:27,720
Just this one night...
go away somewhere.

3129
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:28,960
Let them come.

3130
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:31,120
I'm not going anywhere.

3131
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:42,360
The women, children and older people
are all at the school.

3132
02:26:42,400 --> 02:26:43,720
Only the men remain at the hood.

3133
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:45,040
You should go to the school, too.

3134
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:47,480
Why do you ask me to go there
when all of you are here?

3135
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:50,840
There are a hundred men like me to fight.
But only you are educated.

3136
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:54,200
Only you can take our fight
to the world outside.

3137
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:57,240
If something were to happen to us,
we need you to tell the world.

3138
02:26:57,440 --> 02:26:58,840
Enemy can be excused

3139
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:00,160
But he betrayed me

3140
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:01,160
You should die

3141
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:03,720
Will I come here, if I think
the betrayal you did to my brother?

3142
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:06,560
Don't forget that all this started
because you killed Guna's brother.

3143
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:08,280
Because he killed Pazhani.

3144
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:11,040
If we let his attacker live, the men
in my family won't be respected.

3145
02:27:11,080 --> 02:27:12,800
Don't come here asking for this, brother.

3146
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:14,480
He has no enmity with Anbu--

3147
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:17,120
You can't save his life.

3148
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:18,160
Leave.

3149
02:27:20,760 --> 02:27:22,760
Three of you, go to the entrance.

3150
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:24,200
Go to the roadside.

3151
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:26,320
You stay close to Padma.
Make sure she's okay.

3152
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:27,360
Okay

3153
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:34,960
- Who's there?
- It's us.

3154
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:35,920
'Us' who?

3155
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:41,920
There's a power cut only in our hood.
Check the transformer.

3156
02:28:56,800 --> 02:28:59,280
You gained his trust
and then stabbed him in the back!

3157
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:00,760
Take a good look at me.

3158
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:03,120
I'm bringing you death.

3159
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:17,800
Kumar, don't follow him.

3160
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:19,680
Its his hood.
He will get you lost.

3161
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:31,520
Kumar, he is not here

3162
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:33,400
Search in all corners.

3163
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:40,720
You don't know why I stabbed him.

3164
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:42,880
You don't know what this fight is about.

3165
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:45,160
I won't hurt you.
Just go away.

3166
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:46,360
That's best for everyone.

3167
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:48,160
You tiny little wimp!

3168
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:49,560
You're threatening me?

3169
02:30:58,720 --> 02:31:01,720
It's the tiny anchor that holds
the massive ship in place.

3170
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:14,880
Keep going.

3171
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,200
I think we're being surrounded.

3172
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:19,360
I've got a gun and ten men around me.

3173
02:31:19,400 --> 02:31:20,360
We'll handle it.

3174
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:22,840
- The truck broke down...
- You're blocking the road!

3175
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:24,000
Move it.

3176
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:25,600
I said, move it.

3177
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:28,000
Push!

3178
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:30,040
Stop!

3179
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:32,560
Reverse!

3180
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:12,280
It wouldn't have taken much
to fling that bomb over your car.

3181
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:13,440
But I didn't do that.

3182
02:32:13,480 --> 02:32:15,360
Because I pledged my life to you.

3183
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:17,200
You think I'm begging you?

3184
02:32:17,240 --> 02:32:18,040
No.

3185
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:20,480
I'm walking away.
Let me go.

3186
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:22,400
You're the reason I'm alive.

3187
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:24,200
That's why I'm letting you go now.

3188
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:27,120
But if you sell out our people
for money...

3189
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:31,120
or sacrifice others for your selfishness...

3190
02:32:31,360 --> 02:32:32,480
I'll come after you.

3191
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:35,840
When I come,
I'll kill every last one of you.

3192
02:32:37,880 --> 02:32:39,120
Chandra!

3193
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:42,120
When I said 'every last one of you'...

3194
02:32:42,840 --> 02:32:43,960
I meant everyone.

3195
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:49,280
Give it to me.

3196
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:55,000
Start the car.

3197
02:33:20,360 --> 02:33:22,560
She wanted us to give you the house keys.

3198
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:25,080
She said you can use it for the club.

3199
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:38,960
'Anbu has started to
answer for Rajan's death'

3200
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
'This is just the
beginning of Anbu's life.'

3201
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:43,960
'Rajan's enemies are now his enemies.'

3202
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,160
'They're plotting to kill him.'

3203
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:49,640
'Anbu waits for them.'
