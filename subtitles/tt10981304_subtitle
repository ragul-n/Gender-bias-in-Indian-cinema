00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:41,927
5292…Ongole…Kavali….Nellore…Sullurpeta!

2
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:44,466
Sankranti Special!!! Get in, get in!!!

3
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:51,644
Ticket prices have skyrocketed for
Sankranti.

4
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,550
Buses are also insufficient.

5
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:59,065
No seats. Check some other bus.

6
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:04,705
Please wait there. We are reaching.

7
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,378
Your Attention Please!
train number 17016...

8
00:02:15,973 --> 00:02:23,246
Hyderabad to Visakhapatnam Sankranthi Special
Express has arrived on Platform Number 2.

9
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:25,702
You are listening to ‘Madi Madilo Hyderabad City”

10
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:31,030
Say FM and it is only Radio
City 91.1 and this is RJ Sunita.

11
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,460
Our city roads looked like a moving
ocean with unending traffic till now.

12
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:39,466
And then boom comes the
festival with all its festivity.

13
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:43,060
Bus stations and railway
stations are packed with people.

14
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,499
But from tomorrow we can happily
play cricket on Hyderabad roads!

15
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:50,311
We deserve to celebrate
this mood with a song, right?

16
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:55,436
Keep listening to ‘Madi Madilo Hyderabad City”
Think of FM and think of Radio City 91.1

17
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,249
Your Radio City with Sunita.

18
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:35,113
Why are you up so early, Kesava?

19
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,660
My son’s coming from the city.

20
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Ohh!

21
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,355
Hey, Subbarao.

22
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,456
What’s up, Kesava? Is your son coming home?

23
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,542
Yes, he is.

24
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:11,855
I can sense the vibes
of our village, uncle.

25
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,347
We’re almost there.

26
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,449
Anyhow, it feels great to
go to the city for a livelihood…

27
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:19,324
and then come back to your hometown.

28
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:20,861
Of course.

29
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:23,848
We’re going to eat and
drink till we drop these 4 days.

30
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:26,201
We have the whole
year to eat and get drunk.

31
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,612
But, we only get these 4 days
to spend with our loved ones.

32
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,974
Let’s make it fun!

33
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:32,683
Hmm!

34
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:42,714
Anantharajugaripuram!

35
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:45,081
What is this?
- Dad!

36
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:47,925
Why are you sitting on top? Get down.
- Ok.

37
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,456
He was sitting on the top.
-I know.

38
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:56,894
Why did you climb up at this age?

39
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,605
There was no space down.

40
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,199
Hey, precious!
- So let’s meet again.

41
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:53,552
Hey, Seshagiri. You don’t
have crops in the village anymore.

42
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:54,522
What brings you here?

43
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:57,707
Aren’t I allowed otherwise?
I’m here to visit sir.

44
00:09:57,749 --> 00:09:58,522
Oh.

45
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,863
What’s up with you?

46
00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:02,395
He does all your stuff for you, right?

47
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,199
Why are you cleaning this?

48
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:09,317
My fate has changed
since this came into my life.

49
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:11,156
I won’t let anybody get their hands on it.

50
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:12,778
Dear…
- Yeah, Coming.

51
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:17,982
[humming]

52
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:21,287
What’s the story with this cycle?

53
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:26,115
Brother-in-law rode the
same bicycle in the past and…

54
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:33,240
‘Cotton candy! Cotton candy!’

55
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:47,185
How much cotton candy do
I have to sell to be this rich?

56
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,849
Hey, Cotton candy guy!

57
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:57,771
[old romantic song playing]

58
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:58,779
Cotton candy, please.

59
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:06,756
Wow!

60
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:10,084
I’ve never eaten such sweet cotton candy.

61
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:11,068
Really?

62
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,646
Even I’ve never come
across someone so cute.

63
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:16,537
Really?
- Hmm.

64
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:18,670
I swear on my cotton candy.
- How much is it?

65
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:21,388
It’s worth your smile.

66
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:22,381
Stop it!

67
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,935
He flattered my sister
with his cotton candy.

68
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:28,513
They fell in love and were getting married.

69
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:32,210
Call it his fortune or
my sister’s misfortune.

70
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:35,490
Mr. Anantharaju passed
away soon after the wedding.

71
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,326
The whole village was sobbing.

72
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,443
But, brother-in-law
had a smile on his face.

73
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,474
He rushed to the locker and opened it.

74
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:48,482
All the asset documents were missing.

75
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,779
Sir, you’ve donated us your fields.

76
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:53,435
You’ve given us new lives.

77
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:57,045
That’s when he realized that Mr. Anantharaju
had donated all his assets to the villagers.

78
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:01,193
Thereafter, the villagers called this
place Anantharajupuram in his honor.

79
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:03,209
Though he lost all the assets…

80
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:06,013
He held on to his hope and made good money.

81
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:09,310
Still, he’s referred to as…

82
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:12,685
Look. That’s Mr. Anantharaju’s son-in-law.
- Is it?

83
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:18,631
Hey, son-in-law of Mr. Anantharaju…

84
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:19,717
Hello.

85
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:26,435
As his identity was limited to
being the son-in-law of Mr. Raju…

86
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:28,498
He lost his cool and…

87
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:29,553
And?

88
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:32,576
He loans money to the
villagers to begin with…

89
00:12:33,037 --> 00:12:34,795
and seizes their assets illegally later on.

90
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,443
He wishes to seize the assets
of everybody in the village…

91
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:44,459
and name the village after
himself, Ekambarapuram.

92
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:47,717
Now I get why he slapped me earlier.

93
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:49,357
Hey, son-in-law of Mr. Anantharaju.

94
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:51,834
Of course, he slapped you.

95
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,310
Keep this for now.

96
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,029
I’ll arrange the rest soon.

97
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,857
Bro, should I put the
pickle jar in your blue bag?

98
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:02,248
No, not that bag.

99
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:06,537
Here.

100
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:12,013
Put it in this.

101
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:13,615
She needs more of that beating.

102
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,513
Actually, you deserve it.

103
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:17,021
I don’t need all this.

104
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,162
It’s okay. Take it. Tastes nice.

105
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:23,146
Did you tell him about the
marriage alliance for Bujji?

106
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:25,560
He’s still paying the
loans that I’ve taken.

107
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,318
Wedding would be a burden.

108
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,873
- Okay. You take care.

109
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:32,257
Don’t mention it to him.

110
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:33,159
Less mischief, okay?

111
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:35,310
See you, mom.
- See you.

112
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,865
Bye.
- Bye.

113
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:47,209
Greeting!

114
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:49,482
Don’t say a word.

115
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,959
You visit us briefly like some guest.

116
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:56,014
Can’t help it
City life is hectic.

117
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:57,935
Whatever.

118
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:00,279
What? Are you also leaving, Shanta?

119
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:04,053
He’s taking me along to the city.
- Nice.

120
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,762
You’re doing the right thing, boy.
- It's my responsibility uncle.

121
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:10,037
What have you been up to, Ramana?

122
00:14:10,296 --> 00:14:13,467
I’m the Supervisor of a huge building.

123
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:15,912
I have 20-30 employees working for me.

124
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,248
What more could I ask for?
 What say?

125
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:19,240
Greeting sir.

126
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:20,693
Greeting..
- I went to your house, sir.

127
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:22,302
They said you were here.

128
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,240
Your interest money…
- Hey!

129
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:27,460
You need to pay a hell of lot of
interest to clear your initial interest.

130
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:28,029
Let it be.

131
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:29,208
No, listen.

132
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:30,342
We can sort it out later.

133
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,529
Bus is here. Go.

134
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:32,803
Thank you, sir.

135
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,623
You give 10 bucks and loot 10 folds.

136
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:39,146
Bus has arrived. Go.

137
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,023
If we get in now, we
can catch the train in time.

138
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:46,304
Families can’t bid farewell.

139
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,093
The guys can’t leave home either.

140
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:50,062
They can’t help it.

141
00:14:50,912 --> 00:14:55,937
They should stay away to save their fields.

142
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:01,116
Hey. Stop the bus.

143
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:03,382
Stop the bus.
- Stop the bus.

144
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:06,726
Hold on!

145
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:09,593
Go. Go. Quick.
- Bye, uncle.

146
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:12,921
See you, dad.
- Take care.

147
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:15,257
See you, guys.

148
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:16,038
Okay..

149
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:36,750
Hey!
- Ma’am?

150
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,398
Take a close shot.
- Okay, ma’am.

151
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,555
Did you take a wide angle?

152
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:46,827
Okay?
- Okay ma'am.

153
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:49,304
Take a look.

154
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:58,890
Wow! You look amazing, Chaitra.

155
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:00,964
Why is she so hyper in the morning?

156
00:16:01,516 --> 00:16:03,491
Karthik hasn’t seen me in a couple of days.

157
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,593
He must be missing me like crazy.

158
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,913
I thought I’d surprise
him with these pictures.

159
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:09,874
Send them to my mobile, okay?
- Yes, ma’am. I’ll send it.

160
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:12,374
There’s no point in doing so much.

161
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:17,120
You said he’s your super senior
And you’ve been in love since college.

162
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,796
You’re crazy about him.

163
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,648
But, has he ever given you any attention?

164
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:23,587
No!

165
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:28,393
Has he at least smiled at you?

166
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:29,224
No!

167
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:34,398
Okay, we’ll let that go
There’s no effort from his side.

168
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:40,312
But in all these years, have
you ever had coffee with him? - No!

169
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:44,280
You brainless fellows! Listen up.

170
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,429
Guys go after girls.

171
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,461
We don’t give a crap though we like him.

172
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:52,569
‘Cause we enjoy the attention.

173
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:56,702
Maybe my guy is also enjoying my attention.

174
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,085
Wait and watch.

175
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,710
I’ll send my pictures and
also have coffee with him.

176
00:17:03,962 --> 00:17:05,023
Okay? Sent.

177
00:17:09,382 --> 00:17:12,491
Bah! She’s back to torture me.
- Who? Chaitra?

178
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:12,968
Hmm.

179
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:18,523
Bro, I think the only way to
stop her is for you to say yes.

180
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:20,054
Shut up. Let’s go.

181
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,390
Creatures are dying because
of the plastic in the ocean.

182
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:25,108
Aquatic life and earth
cycle is being damaged.

183
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:26,054
Using satellite…

184
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,524
We can trace out the exact location of
plastic in the ocean and clean them out.

185
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:35,757
Well, as you can see, to clear
the ocean of all the plastic…

186
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:39,866
I’ve been waiting for this kind
of opportunity for many years.

187
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:43,389
We will collaborate with
Fortune 500 companies.

188
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:48,304
I know, I know the time is too
less to execute this kind of a project.

189
00:17:49,162 --> 00:17:50,210
Karthik…
- Sir.

190
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,710
I’d like you to take the
lead on this project, please.

191
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:54,460
Sure, sir. I’ll do my best.

192
00:17:56,398 --> 00:18:00,210
Karthik will kill you if he sees that
you’re killing time in the cafeteria. - True.

193
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:02,710
Cafeteria is meant for killing time.

194
00:18:02,897 --> 00:18:03,194
Oh!

195
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,780
But from tomorrow, we
won’t have the leisure.

196
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:07,335
Just got the mail.

197
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,343
Do you think we can meet the deadline?

198
00:18:10,937 --> 00:18:12,577
Man, projects and deadlines are our thing.

199
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:14,562
Okay. I’ll be on it.

200
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,874
That project is sorted.

201
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:25,991
What about this pending project?

202
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:28,944
Pending project? Whoa! Ma’am!

203
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:30,382
Damn! She’s here.

204
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,710
Oi! What are you doing here?

205
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:38,062
I’ve sent you pictures. No reply from you.

206
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:41,788
You’ve taken care of me. Now it’s my turn.

207
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,687
That is why I’m here.

208
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,773
I told you she won’t
back off till you say yes.

209
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:46,788
Of course.

210
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:49,015
Do you know how tough
it was to come inside?

211
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:50,249
Let’s have coffee?

212
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:51,952
Coffee, please.

213
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,630
Guys, will you have coffee with
us or shall I change the team?

214
00:18:57,655 --> 00:18:59,421
No. No. Coming. Coming.

215
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:01,296
Talk to him. Let us go.
- Why don’t you stay?

216
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:04,523
Getting a coffee date
with Karthik isn’t easy.

217
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,468
What could be so hard?

218
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:20,882
Hey! What are you doing here?

219
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:22,249
Isn’t it obvious?

220
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,124
I mean, you’re buying veggies.

221
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:25,861
Aren’t I allowed to?

222
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:29,452
Do you cook as well?

223
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,630
He cooks amazingly well.

224
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:36,296
Chaitra, you’re so lucky!
- Why?

225
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:39,780
A girl is damn lucky if her
husband is a good cook.

226
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:41,124
Whoa!

227
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:45,148
Why don’t you marry a chef then?

228
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:48,702
I guess you eat a lot of spice.

229
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:50,515
You seem all fired up.

230
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:54,788
Have a carrot, Karthik.
It’s good for your eyes.

231
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,054
Maybe then you’ll see how beautiful I am.

232
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,233
I can see how crazy you
are ‘cause I’m eating this.

233
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:04,452
Bro, shall I get a wood apple?
- Sure. It’s good for the ears.

234
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:08,475
Maybe then you’ll hear
my heartbeat loudly.

235
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:09,849
My senses are just fine.

236
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:11,655
It’s your brain that’s screwed.

237
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,538
Well said.

238
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:15,389
That’s what my mom says.

239
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:19,130
In my case, my dad also says the same.
- Oh!

240
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:19,740
Hmm.

241
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:20,494
Ohh!

242
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:23,641
Me and my brain are special.
- Totally forgot about the coffee.

243
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:27,380
Coffee...., please.
- Go away.

244
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:28,794
Coffee…

245
00:20:29,468 --> 00:20:30,130
Please.

246
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,757
One Coffee..please.
- No.

247
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,279
Let’s bring our daughter
home for delivery on a good day.

248
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:43,521
Sure, dear.

249
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:49,818
We were just thinking
of you and you’re here.

250
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:51,878
Why did you come alone? Where’s son-in-law?

251
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,388
Why are you quiet?

252
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:02,669
You promised something fancy as dowry.

253
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:08,794
He asked me to get our land
documents along with the baby this time.

254
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:12,745
What do we do, dear?

255
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,443
Let me think.

256
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:18,637
I asked Raghu for some money.

257
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:21,784
He said he’d help.

258
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:35,466
Look, something’s on fire.

259
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,427
What have you done?

260
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:49,794
I’d rather destroy the
whole thing than sell it.

261
00:22:02,093 --> 00:22:04,404
You haven’t eaten in 2 days. Have some.

262
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:08,216
I don’t know. Life seems so terrifying.

263
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:12,833
I’d die. But I’m worried about you guys.

264
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:14,654
Please don’t say that.

265
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,911
I knew you’d say that.

266
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:23,802
You burned the crop
‘cause it wasn’t fruitful.

267
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,294
Why would you torture your body though?

268
00:22:26,702 --> 00:22:27,066
Here.

269
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,357
Take it.

270
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,935
You’re so stubborn.

271
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:35,224
Why don’t you sell that crop to me?

272
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:38,263
It’s half destroyed.

273
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:39,087
Yeah, brother-in-law.

274
00:22:39,646 --> 00:22:41,255
Why would you want to buy that?

275
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,490
Do you have a better idea?

276
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:44,115
I can’t watch him ruin everything.

277
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:46,390
I must do something.

278
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:50,780
He’s going through a tough phase.

279
00:22:57,062 --> 00:22:58,077
My land documents.

280
00:22:59,179 --> 00:22:59,983
Keep them.

281
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:03,163
You have great self-respect.

282
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:07,108
I can’t accept those. Give it to him.

283
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:11,444
Take it.

284
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:12,717
Take it.

285
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:16,616
You have a really big heart.

286
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:19,413
We’ve only heard about your father-in-law.

287
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:21,522
Seeing you today, it’s
like we’re seeing him.

288
00:23:24,264 --> 00:23:24,757
Let’s go.

289
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:32,374
I can’t make them forget my
father-in-law no matter what I do.

290
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:33,296
Give me that.

291
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:37,327
Ask the MRO to check the land details.

292
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:40,491
We want everything in our name.
- Sure, brother-in-law.

293
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:44,686
It’s not a matter of days.

294
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,469
I’ve been trying to
impress you since one year.

295
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:47,971
Why wouldn’t he like me?

296
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:51,810
You look so beautiful!

297
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:55,312
What’s the problem?

298
00:23:55,554 --> 00:23:57,945
Think deeply. You’ll see it.

299
00:23:58,234 --> 00:24:00,695
What’s the problem?

300
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,820
Hey, crazy girl! I asked
you to think. Not yell.

301
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:14,382
Why is everybody gathered here?

302
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:17,413
What’s wrong?
- Ravi’s been fired.

303
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:19,700
He submitted fake experience certificates.

304
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:21,803
Moreover, you know our boss can be a jerk.

305
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:23,296
Where is he?

306
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:24,632
Over there.

307
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,116
Poor guy! He’s really nervous.

308
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:39,195
Guys like him bring ill
reputation to our company.

309
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:43,007
You’re right, sir.

310
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,171
His credentials are all fine.

311
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:48,569
But, why did he submit fake certificates?

312
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:51,647
How am I supposed to know?
- By giving him a chance, sir.

313
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:55,522
Do you know the loopholes
in our software company?

314
00:24:56,764 --> 00:24:58,011
You don’t get a job
unless you’re experienced.

315
00:24:58,726 --> 00:25:00,038
You don’t gain experience
unless you have a job.

316
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:04,678
You can’t enter this loop
unless there’s some miracle.

317
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:08,585
Maybe he didn’t stand a chance.

318
00:25:09,015 --> 00:25:10,413
Are you saying he did the right thing?

319
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:12,592
I’m talking about the situation, sir.

320
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,366
For example, we
released a project recently.

321
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,428
He did most of the work there.

322
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,342
If you don’t mind, I want
to tell you something.

323
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,538
You trusted a piece of paper and
be brought great reputation to us.

324
00:25:27,288 --> 00:25:29,616
Imagine what he’d achieve
if you actually trusted him.

325
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:31,546
Give it a thought.

326
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:35,467
See you, sir.

327
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:40,186
Hey!

328
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:41,202
Yeah, Ravi?

329
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:46,678
I don’t know what to say or how to say it.

330
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,014
With my current degree,

331
00:25:53,202 --> 00:25:54,952
I always felt insecure about my future.

332
00:25:57,672 --> 00:25:58,967
I thought about it from your perspective.

333
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,702
I felt insecure too.

334
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,116
You handed my future to me.

335
00:26:05,086 --> 00:26:05,733
Thank you!

336
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:09,092
Hey, come on!

337
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,600
Cool down.

338
00:26:12,008 --> 00:26:13,702
Friends not only make you happy.

339
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:15,554
They also make you feel secure.

340
00:26:19,154 --> 00:26:20,155
Stop getting so emotional.

341
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:23,717
Alright.
- Let’s go and chill.

342
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,124
Hey, I’ve got urgent work. Move.

343
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:44,507
This is also urgent.

344
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:45,405
What is?

345
00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:47,202
Marriage.
- Then get married.

346
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:56,460
What should I do to make
you fall in love with me?

347
00:26:57,662 --> 00:26:58,710
Let me ask you this instead.

348
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:01,639
What should I do for you
to leave me alone? Tell me.

349
00:27:03,113 --> 00:27:07,527
No matter what, there’s no
way I’m leaving you alone.

350
00:27:07,942 --> 00:27:11,241
No way in hell!

351
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:49,447
Life sucks, man
There’s always some problem or the other.

352
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:52,898
First, it was getting through school
Then, it was getting a job.

353
00:30:53,203 --> 00:30:54,212
Now, it’s marriage.

354
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:56,079
There’s only one solution
to all these problems.

355
00:30:59,398 --> 00:30:59,892
Who is it?

356
00:31:00,594 --> 00:31:02,056
My mother.
- Regarding?

357
00:31:02,845 --> 00:31:03,853
Love recommendation.

358
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:05,868
Come on, auntie.

359
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,876
You can’t take that crazy girl seriously.

360
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:10,517
What’s wrong, son?
- One second.

361
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:13,548
Guys, it’s personal
Let’s get out of here.

362
00:31:13,813 --> 00:31:15,876
Why did you come at this hour?

363
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:17,728
On top of that, you
brought your mother along.

364
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,040
What’s the matter?

365
00:31:19,188 --> 00:31:22,048
Why don’t you love my daughter?
What’s the problem?

366
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:23,290
What’s the problem?

367
00:31:23,985 --> 00:31:25,681
No problem
I don’t mind being your friend.

368
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:26,954
That’s great.

369
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:28,392
Yeah, great.

370
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:32,993
Life is beautiful if you
marry your best friend.

371
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:35,454
Your uncle and I were also good friends.

372
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,337
We got married later on.

373
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:40,079
Life is amazing now.
- Really amazing.

374
00:31:41,954 --> 00:31:43,579
It’s not that, auntie.
- What is it then?

375
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:45,673
A financial issue?

376
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:48,040
We’ve also worked hard to
reach where we are today.

377
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,595
Mommy, you can leave now.

378
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,759
No, listen.
- Chaitra wants you to leave. Go!

379
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:55,126
Whatever. Idiot...

380
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:57,556
Are you out of your mind?
Why would you bring your mother?

381
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,236
Karthik, I really like you.

382
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,095
My family is looking
for a prospective groom.

383
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:06,087
But, I don’t feel this
way about anybody else.

384
00:32:07,297 --> 00:32:11,689
I don’t belong to the family of people
who threaten their love interests.

385
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:17,641
But, I’m confident that I’d be
really happy with you in my life.

386
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:19,789
Ultimately, it’s your decision.

387
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:38,193
Yay! Congratulations!
What is this??

388
00:32:38,218 --> 00:32:40,304
Excuse me!...
- Party.

389
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:42,149
I’m really proud of you, Karthik.

390
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:44,876
Why, sir?
- Karthik is the Employee of the Year.

391
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:49,027
Guys… Guys… I have another good news.

392
00:32:49,454 --> 00:32:52,228
You’re going to be the
Manager of our US branch.

393
00:32:53,837 --> 00:32:55,851
That’s amazing!
- Take me along, dude.

394
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:58,837
So…I think it calls for a celebration.

395
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:00,277
Let’s celebrate tonight.

396
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,962
Hey, Swarna. What are you thinking about?

397
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,118
I’m wondering how he’s playing.

398
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:15,134
Why are you straining yourself? Just chill.

399
00:33:15,656 --> 00:33:16,947
What’s up, guys? What are you doing?

400
00:33:18,836 --> 00:33:19,517
Always drinking!

401
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:22,603
You don’t workout or diet.

402
00:33:23,306 --> 00:33:25,900
I’ll start tomorrow.
- Hello. Phone.

403
00:33:27,032 --> 00:33:28,509
Answer it. Can’t miss the call.

404
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:31,079
I was eavesdropping last night.

405
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:32,618
Yeah? Mind your business.

406
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:33,368
Okay.

407
00:33:34,438 --> 00:33:34,712
Hello.

408
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:36,275
Karthik, where are you?

409
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:39,829
Outside.

410
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,884
Daddy wants to talk to you.

411
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:44,775
First, it was your mom
Now your dad wants to talk.

412
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:48,338
Won’t you leave me alone?
Alright. I’ll come to him.

413
00:33:49,032 --> 00:33:51,001
What?! Really?!

414
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:52,533
I didn’t expect this.

415
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:55,611
See you first thing in the
morning tomorrow, okay?

416
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:56,400
Okay, bye.

417
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:04,353
I see new promotions happening
and new feelings taking bloom.

418
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:06,290
Nothing like that.

419
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:10,025
Hey!..

420
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,243
I swear there’s nothing.

421
00:34:11,735 --> 00:34:12,431
Hey, one second.

422
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:14,493
Is it a secret?

423
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:15,251
It’s dad.

424
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:16,243
Oh!

425
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:17,587
Yes, dad?

426
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:19,486
what are you doing?

427
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,517
Nothing. At a small party.

428
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:23,181
Actually, I was going to call you.

429
00:34:23,492 --> 00:34:24,267
What are you doing?

430
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:25,868
I’m at home.

431
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:30,142
So, listen. I got the money.

432
00:34:32,843 --> 00:34:37,853
I’ve had a satisfying meal after so long.

433
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:44,884
This whole time, I was worried
about some loan shark barging in.

434
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,036
I don’t have that fear anymore.

435
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:50,833
Dad…

436
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:51,824
Huh?

437
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,065
What is it?

438
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:59,176
Are you fine with whatever
decision I take at this point?

439
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:01,079
Of course, son.

440
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:03,814
If you were irresponsible,
I’d have hesitated.

441
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:06,017
But I’m sure you’ll never do wrong.

442
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,158
Okay, dad. Bye.

443
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:09,897
Alright.

444
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:16,212
What a father-son duo! Just perfect!

445
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,533
He intimates you before doing anything.

446
00:35:18,688 --> 00:35:20,634
You accept everything that he does.

447
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:23,829
Of course my son tells me everything.

448
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,095
He seeks my approval.

449
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:29,751
Sweet! Such cuties, you and your son.

450
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:33,376
Dear, we’re looking for a
marriage alliance for Bujji anyway.

451
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:37,009
Let’s find a prospective
bride for him as well.

452
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,384
I’m on it.

453
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:41,525
The neighboring Village Head is
looking at our son for his daughter.

454
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:43,540
I’ll talk to him next time we meet.

455
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:51,165
Harsha MBBS weds Vidya MBBS.

456
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:52,452
Sounds nice.
- Hi.

457
00:35:52,821 --> 00:35:54,947
You’re a doctor and so
are your wife and son.

458
00:35:54,972 --> 00:35:56,806
And your future
daughter-in-law is also a doctor.

459
00:35:57,015 --> 00:35:59,220
Your house is going to be
like a multi-specialty hospital.

460
00:35:59,305 --> 00:36:02,226
I should invite a lot of
other guests. See you.

461
00:36:02,547 --> 00:36:04,335
You should definitely come.
- Sure. Thank you.

462
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:07,087
Hey, Karthik!
- Hi.

463
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,562
So good to see you.

464
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:10,853
Good to see you too.
- So glad you came. Come. Come.

465
00:36:11,242 --> 00:36:11,591
Sit down.

466
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:13,480
Hi, Karthik.

467
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:14,357
Hi, auntie.

468
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:17,306
So, what will you have?
Tea, coffee or juice?

469
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,947
I’m good, uncle.
- I guess he’s shy.

470
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:21,939
Get everything. He’ll take what he likes.

471
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,322
Karthik, I’m not shy like you.

472
00:36:24,672 --> 00:36:25,767
So I’ll come straight to the point.

473
00:36:27,845 --> 00:36:29,072
Chaitra really loves you.

474
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:35,040
I’m guessing you know that too.

475
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:38,978
Once we know your opinion,
we can probably take it further.

476
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:40,001
To be honest,

477
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:43,079
I like her too.

478
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:46,486
That’s great. Are you happy?

479
00:36:48,867 --> 00:36:52,814
So, Karthik. I’d love to talk to
your parents about the wedding.

480
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,751
And at the same time, I’ll hand
over all my companies to you…

481
00:36:58,907 --> 00:37:00,767
Go to some far off place and relax.

482
00:37:01,368 --> 00:37:02,478
Thanks, uncle.

483
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:05,470
But, I have
some other plans.

484
00:37:05,563 --> 00:37:06,415
Oh, really?
- Yeah.

485
00:37:06,923 --> 00:37:07,736
What do you want to do?

486
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:10,017
I want to take up farming.

487
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:16,388
What?!

488
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:21,165
Are you kidding?

489
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,447
No, uncle. I want to do farming.

490
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:28,009
What are you talking, Karthik?

491
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:30,611
Do you get what you’re saying?

492
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,868
You belong on the red carpet.

493
00:37:36,477 --> 00:37:37,837
Why do you want to walk in mud?

494
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:42,767
You should receive many more
Employee of the Year mementos.

495
00:37:43,015 --> 00:37:45,767
Actually, no. You’ve reached a
level where you give out mementos.

496
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,633
Why do you want to move backwards in life?

497
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:50,953
Don’t you think it’s foolish?

498
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,431
Uncle, you were talking
to somebody earlier.

499
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:55,759
I’m guessing an old friend.

500
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:57,376
He’s a doctor.

501
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,913
He made his son become a doctor.

502
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:00,883
You’re an Engineer.

503
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,337
You made your daughter one too.

504
00:38:05,844 --> 00:38:06,236
Uncle,

505
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:10,306
Hero is passing on his legacy to his son.

506
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:14,368
Doctor is passing on his legacy to his son.

507
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,306
But, a farmer...

508
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:22,361
..is not shaping his son into a farmer.

509
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:26,579
I believe we should pass our profession
to our heirs for them to be successful.

510
00:38:28,311 --> 00:38:30,611
Why don’t you find an alternative?
For Chaitra’s sake.

511
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:32,572
No, uncle.

512
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:37,798
This is the reason I didn’t
express my true feelings for Chaitra.

513
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,236
Why is the tea so light?

514
00:38:53,803 --> 00:38:54,181
Uncle.

515
00:38:56,372 --> 00:39:00,158
Hey! What are you doing here?

516
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:02,009
I should ask you that.

517
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:05,283
I told you I work as a
Supervisor for buildings.

518
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:06,970
Look. This is my project.

519
00:39:07,146 --> 00:39:07,790
Great!

520
00:39:08,677 --> 00:39:10,853
Isn’t it great to meet someone
from your hometown in the city?

521
00:39:10,896 --> 00:39:12,564
True. We haven’t met in so long.

522
00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:16,728
We could sit and talk.
But I’m kind of busy.

523
00:39:16,818 --> 00:39:18,915
They don’t work unless I’m watching.

524
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:20,785
No worries.
- Let’s talk once I’m off duty.

525
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,009
Alright See you, Send my best to aunt.
- See you.

526
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:34,072
I should’ve taken his number.

527
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:47,103
Stop talking and work.

528
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:51,556
Excuse me. Where can I find the Supervisor?

529
00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:53,478
I’m the Supervisor. What do you want?

530
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:54,706
But, uncle…

531
00:39:56,798 --> 00:39:57,767
Ramana…

532
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:02,181
Oh, Venkata Ramana?
He must be unloading the material. Go look.

533
00:40:03,471 --> 00:40:06,470
You focus on work.
Don’t get distracted.

534
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:20,658
What is this, uncle?

535
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:22,064
You know how it is.

536
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:23,398
We took loans and did farming.

537
00:41:24,877 --> 00:41:28,072
Hoping the crop would make us money.

538
00:41:29,814 --> 00:41:31,267
But it shattered our lives.

539
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:36,025
I have to do something to feed the family.

540
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,431
Why don’t you find a job back home?

541
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:40,079
What job?

542
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:44,409
I can’t work as labor in the
same place I once flourished in.

543
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:47,533
I’m toiling in silence
to earn a livelihood.

544
00:42:01,806 --> 00:42:03,767
Son, get going.

545
00:42:05,048 --> 00:42:06,689
Aunt will feel embarrassed if she sees you.

546
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:13,486
No matter how tough it gets,
remember that I’m always here.

547
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:16,009
Ramana!

548
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,408
Coming!
- Why aren’t you working?

549
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:20,408
Son,

550
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:25,134
Your job earns you respect
That respect earns you attention.

551
00:42:26,634 --> 00:42:29,587
Don’t tell anybody back home.

552
00:42:40,017 --> 00:42:41,759
Brother-in-law…

553
00:42:42,868 --> 00:42:43,642
The MRO is here.

554
00:42:44,618 --> 00:42:46,072
Why don’t you say something?

555
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,251
I’ve only taken documents
from people till now.

556
00:42:51,345 --> 00:42:55,220
But that guy Kesava took
documents from me after so long.

557
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,126
It’s the doing of his son.

558
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:58,962
He’s sending him money from the city.

559
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:01,587
Don’t you worry.

560
00:43:01,784 --> 00:43:03,361
I’ve gone through all the accounts.

561
00:43:03,704 --> 00:43:05,077
Just wait for a year.

562
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:10,853
You can seize all their lands in
exchange for the interest on the loan.

563
00:43:14,909 --> 00:43:17,368
Chalapathy, my son is going to America.

564
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,642
Oh, is it?

565
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:21,533
Tell Malli as well.

566
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:24,111
Hey, monkey!
- Bro!!!

567
00:43:25,028 --> 00:43:26,540
It’s so heavy.

568
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,533
Mom, brother is here.
- How are you, son?

569
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,423
Yeah. I’ll call you back.

570
00:43:34,543 --> 00:43:37,231
Your dad would’ve received
you if we knew you were coming.

571
00:43:37,293 --> 00:43:38,704
It’s okay.

572
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:40,954
Your dad is overwhelmed.

573
00:43:41,137 --> 00:43:45,712
He’s been telling everybody
that you’re going to America.

574
00:43:47,485 --> 00:43:49,681
He must be starving.
Get him some food.

575
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,487
Come on.

576
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,525
Have some more.

577
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:55,853
Enough.
- Here. Water.

578
00:43:58,543 --> 00:44:05,478
Hey, get me an iPod, a MacBook and
tons of makeup when you go to the US.

579
00:44:06,189 --> 00:44:07,939
When are you leaving to the US, son?

580
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:13,220
I don’t want to go, dad.

581
00:44:14,337 --> 00:44:19,181
I know you can’t leave us and go that far.

582
00:44:19,345 --> 00:44:22,314
But when you get an
opportunity to grow, don’t lose it.

583
00:44:26,283 --> 00:44:27,908
I want to stay back and do farming.

584
00:44:33,188 --> 00:44:33,859
Farming?

585
00:44:36,868 --> 00:44:37,861
Why would you want to do that?

586
00:44:38,368 --> 00:44:39,267
Why would you say that, dad?

587
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:41,243
Grandpa was into farming and so were you.

588
00:44:41,768 --> 00:44:42,736
I want to take it up now.

589
00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:46,135
You always say that our
occupation should give us joy.

590
00:44:46,462 --> 00:44:48,001
Farming doesn’t give you joy.

591
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:50,673
It only gives you trouble,
losses and a hell lot of stress.

592
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:55,689
If I wanted you to do farming,
I’d have taken you to the fields.

593
00:44:55,831 --> 00:44:57,431
Why would I work hard
to get you an education?

594
00:44:57,915 --> 00:44:59,634
It’ll be great if a literate
gets into farming.

595
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:00,564
What the hell!

596
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,892
Our lives are just getting better
and it’s surely not due to farming.

597
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:05,150
It’s all thanks to your job.

598
00:45:05,627 --> 00:45:06,431
Get back to your job.

599
00:45:10,283 --> 00:45:11,259
I quit.

600
00:45:16,443 --> 00:45:17,134
What?!

601
00:45:19,732 --> 00:45:21,431
What is he saying?

602
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:26,415
People are struggling to
get a job and he quit his?

603
00:45:37,186 --> 00:45:39,415
I was recently thinking
that my bad days are over.

604
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:41,689
Don’t bring them back, please.

605
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,150
What’s happening, bro?

606
00:45:51,013 --> 00:45:52,923
Uncle, I heard your son is in town.

607
00:45:55,543 --> 00:45:57,220
Whoa! You’re serious!

608
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,314
Why does your dad look so serious?

609
00:46:01,716 --> 00:46:02,650
It’s nothing. Let’s go.

610
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,501
I thought maybe you
must’ve brought a girl home.

611
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,493
Ohh!

612
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,751
When did aunt come home?

613
00:46:19,286 --> 00:46:20,250
Been a couple of days.

614
00:46:20,536 --> 00:46:23,353
She told her son that she
couldn’t stay there anymore.

615
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:26,181
Anyhow, when are you going to the US?

616
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,517
Kesava, you’re a lucky man.

617
00:46:30,965 --> 00:46:33,681
You worked hard to provide
education to your son.

618
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,212
He’s going overseas now.

619
00:46:41,888 --> 00:46:42,216
Tell me.

620
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:44,243
Aunt has fainted feeling breathless.

621
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:46,007
I'm Feeling anxious about it.

622
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:48,892
We are taking her to
the hospital. Come soon.

623
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:49,921
I’ll be there.

624
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:36,931
No. Keep it.

625
00:48:04,812 --> 00:48:05,158
Sir!

626
00:48:06,337 --> 00:48:08,540
Sorry, Sir. I was slightly
busy and didn’t notice, Sir.

627
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:10,876
Sir! Ok, Sir.

628
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:11,851
I will deliver it in the morning, Sir.

629
00:48:12,688 --> 00:48:13,556
Sir…ok, Sir.

630
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,929
Hey, please request
aunt to take care of mom.

631
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,407
Keep this.

632
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,960
What do you mean,
brother-in-law? Are you leaving?

633
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,428
I have to, man. I have a lot of work.

634
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:23,612
When do you not have work?

635
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:25,395
Why don’t you stay for a couple
of days and look after your mom?

636
00:48:25,617 --> 00:48:28,454
Do you think I wouldn’t like to do that?

637
00:48:30,252 --> 00:48:31,861
That’s why I took mom to the city.

638
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:33,462
But she couldn’t adjust there.

639
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:35,181
She was after my life until
I brought her back here.

640
00:48:35,783 --> 00:48:38,767
We can’t blame her, bro.
She is used to life here.

641
00:48:40,908 --> 00:48:42,736
I thought I could look
after mom well, if I got a job.

642
00:48:43,455 --> 00:48:45,408
But once I got it, I am unable
to do anything except my job.

643
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,064
Mom is not able to stay there and
I am not able to find any work here.

644
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:55,712
This bloody life! Our lives
have become meaningless.

645
00:48:59,048 --> 00:48:59,840
Here, take this.

646
00:49:07,156 --> 00:49:08,408
Very sad! It’s the same
story with everyone.

647
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:11,733
They are not able to survive
unless they leave the village.

648
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:15,711
And those who live here?

649
00:49:16,556 --> 00:49:18,106
They don’t even have a shoulder to cry on.

650
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,720
If you take a good look,
you will find no one happy.

651
00:49:24,806 --> 00:49:25,363
Sad, brother-in-law!

652
00:49:27,346 --> 00:49:28,911
The village is in a bad
condition just like aunt.

653
00:51:40,816 --> 00:51:41,231
Karthik!

654
00:51:43,035 --> 00:51:44,033
How many times should I call you?

655
00:51:45,473 --> 00:51:46,501
Why are you not answering the phone?

656
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:49,103
You simply left me behind!

657
00:51:50,894 --> 00:51:51,986
Why are you silent?

658
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:57,955
Obey my Dad at least
till we get married, Karthik.

659
00:52:00,198 --> 00:52:01,450
After that, do as you wish.

660
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,248
I am talking to you, Karthik!

661
00:52:14,495 --> 00:52:15,072
Hey!

662
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:15,742
Rey!

663
00:52:16,496 --> 00:52:17,761
What are you doing?
- Have you gone mad?

664
00:52:18,191 --> 00:52:19,628
Why are you acting crazy like this?

665
00:52:21,363 --> 00:52:22,556
Please look for it there.

666
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:25,556
Chaitra!

667
00:52:28,385 --> 00:52:30,447
It’s not here.
- Not there. Over there!

668
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:33,134
Chaitra!

669
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:36,535
It’s just an object.

670
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,330
You are so restless for a missing object.

671
00:52:50,489 --> 00:52:53,587
Here, the people I grew
up with have gone missing.

672
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:57,721
By the way,

673
00:52:59,722 --> 00:53:00,701
why do you love me?

674
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:02,923
I am very fond of you.

675
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:03,773
Yeah, but why?

676
00:53:04,277 --> 00:53:06,830
I like your character.

677
00:53:07,175 --> 00:53:07,607
Character?

678
00:53:10,878 --> 00:53:12,056
Do you know its origin?

679
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:15,424
This village.

680
00:53:17,676 --> 00:53:19,033
The people I grew up with.

681
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:28,613
If someone stepped into her house,
my aunt would never send them hungry.

682
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:32,331
I learnt giving from her.

683
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:35,744
My Uncle Ramana used to say,

684
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:42,595
“Bear your own suffering
but share your joy.”

685
00:53:46,143 --> 00:53:48,298
I learnt the value of
suffering and joy from him.

686
00:53:51,075 --> 00:53:55,080
Such a great man is
working for daily wages now.

687
00:53:56,324 --> 00:53:57,767
He has become a daily worker.

688
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:01,871
Everyone is in the same situation.

689
00:54:03,215 --> 00:54:07,378
I came here only for festivals and thought
the village was always in festivity.

690
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,470
I know the truth now.

691
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:18,259
Locked doors on one hand and anticipating
old people sitting on the other.

692
00:54:22,957 --> 00:54:24,548
Can you guess what they
are waiting for, Chaitra?

693
00:54:27,105 --> 00:54:30,626
Either a festival or a funeral.

694
00:54:33,557 --> 00:54:38,806
Because the kids don’t come back
except on these two occasions.

695
00:54:40,705 --> 00:54:41,317
They don’t.

696
00:54:42,399 --> 00:54:43,369
Tell me now.

697
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:49,875
Shall I desert the village and the people
who shaped my character and go my way?

698
00:54:51,752 --> 00:54:54,218
I never saw tears in your eyes, Karthik.

699
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:59,783
I see them now and I
don’t know what to say.

700
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:05,725
Here!

701
00:55:07,253 --> 00:55:08,259
Why do you say that?

702
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:10,009
Why did you come here in the first place?

703
00:55:11,783 --> 00:55:12,634
To take up farming.

704
00:55:15,932 --> 00:55:18,783
I thought those who migrated
from here were living comfortably.

705
00:55:20,298 --> 00:55:21,955
But they are doing odd jobs for survival.

706
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:26,947
I thought it was enough
if I took up farming alone.

707
00:55:29,217 --> 00:55:31,931
But no….
Call everyone back.

708
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:51,986
Hey, Karthik! Out of the blue,
you asked everyone to come.

709
00:55:52,344 --> 00:55:53,370
They are all here seated.

710
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:56,400
Now that they are here, you
have become quiet as a lamb.

711
00:55:56,544 --> 00:55:57,489
What is the matter?

712
00:55:58,199 --> 00:55:59,869
Why was this village formed, Uncle?

713
00:56:00,144 --> 00:56:03,722
To stay together and to
partake in each other’s difficulties.

714
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:06,267
Then why are you severing that bond now?

715
00:56:07,105 --> 00:56:09,144
Who would like to sever bonds, son?

716
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,291
But there is no other option.

717
00:56:12,504 --> 00:56:13,869
Who said there is no option, Uncle?

718
00:56:15,065 --> 00:56:16,369
If we believe that we will get stuck here.

719
00:56:17,035 --> 00:56:17,822
Hey, Karhtik!

720
00:56:18,534 --> 00:56:20,212
What is your point? Shoot it straight.

721
00:56:24,003 --> 00:56:27,033
Nothing much, Uncle. Let us all
stay here and get back to agriculture.

722
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,970
You sound like eggs
trying to teach the hen.

723
00:56:34,581 --> 00:56:37,392
First of all, what do you
know about agriculture, huh?

724
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:41,548
Water but no seeds. Seeds but no power
Power but no manure.

725
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:45,220
Yet  when we do manage
to raise a crop, no market!

726
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:48,283
Bloody hell! Farming has become a gamble.

727
00:56:48,736 --> 00:56:50,892
Do you expect us to come
back and gamble again?

728
00:56:51,073 --> 00:56:52,259
Weren’t we successful 25 years ago?

729
00:56:52,745 --> 00:56:55,236
You may be right, son.
Everything was fine then.

730
00:56:55,511 --> 00:56:57,323
But circumstances have
drastically changed now.

731
00:56:57,348 --> 00:56:58,345
That’s exactly what I am saying.

732
00:56:58,644 --> 00:57:01,173
Circumstances have
changed and so should we.

733
00:57:01,347 --> 00:57:01,814
Hello...

734
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,525
Forget the circumstances and systems
First, you got to change.

735
00:57:07,371 --> 00:57:09,345
There are enough dead
bodies in the village.

736
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,525
Do you want to call the
others here and kill more?

737
00:57:11,776 --> 00:57:14,416
Hey, wait man!

738
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:17,306
Why don’t you let the youngster speak?

739
00:57:18,089 --> 00:57:20,097
Didn’t you say you must
adapt to the situation?

740
00:57:20,964 --> 00:57:22,737
As if you are not aware of their situation!

741
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:27,408
You went away to work and
settle the debts of your family.

742
00:57:29,121 --> 00:57:31,150
But they also have their
commitments and responsibilities.

743
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,751
On what basis can they return?

744
00:57:33,073 --> 00:57:35,009
Brother-in-law asked you
a question. Answer him.

745
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:39,337
This is next to impossible!
Let’s go.

746
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:40,728
Yes, move. Move!

747
00:57:40,831 --> 00:57:44,001
Uncle! Wait a minute. Just a minute.
- Go!...

748
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:45,798
Only one minute!

749
00:57:51,324 --> 00:57:53,439
If your responsibilities
are the only obstacle,

750
00:57:54,612 --> 00:57:58,908
I am ready to pay you salary
as much as you earn in the city.

751
00:58:06,777 --> 00:58:07,939
Will you come and work here?

752
00:58:10,683 --> 00:58:12,650
You don’t have to work even
a minute longer than 8 hours.

753
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:16,767
You are not at all
concerned with profit or loss.

754
00:58:17,558 --> 00:58:18,603
I will bear everything.

755
00:58:18,715 --> 00:58:20,923
Hey, Karthik! Why do
you want to risk so much?

756
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:23,548
You used to say something
when I was a child.

757
00:58:24,355 --> 00:58:26,595
Damn this government job! It is
not greater than my four acre land.

758
00:58:28,565 --> 00:58:30,087
It used to sound so
good to hear you say that.

759
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:36,142
I want to see the same pride and the same
haughtiness in you and in each one of you.

760
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,580
Let us work on nothing
but a path of success.

761
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:47,087
Strands are woven into a rope. Bricks line
up a house and we together make a village.

762
00:58:49,737 --> 00:58:52,837
Say yes and we shall
launch it today itself.

763
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:59,150
Sounds good, son.

764
00:58:59,283 --> 00:59:02,572
But we should always
be prepared for the worst.

765
00:59:03,948 --> 00:59:05,462
We must consider pros and cons too.

766
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:09,111
What if there is no profit? Just in case?

767
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:11,806
No chance, Uncle. I have calculated…

768
00:59:11,943 --> 00:59:12,958
What I mean to say is…

769
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:14,745
You have no experience.

770
00:59:15,099 --> 00:59:15,934
If you run into losses,

771
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,873
how long can you pay them salaries?

772
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:20,666
Three months? Six months? A year?

773
00:59:20,866 --> 00:59:23,205
After that?
You will get back to your job.

774
00:59:23,514 --> 00:59:24,455
But what about them?

775
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:26,955
Ha! Shall we go waste?
- Reply.

776
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,439
He asked you a valid question.

777
00:59:28,646 --> 00:59:30,423
I ask you to trust me just once.

778
00:59:30,521 --> 00:59:35,869
Hey, it is only out of trust that we came so
far as soon as you called without a question.

779
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:40,353
We have neither the years nor the
strength to hope and then face despair.

780
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:44,189
I beg you. Just leave us alone.

781
00:59:44,427 --> 00:59:46,033
It’s not that, Uncle.
- Let us go, man.

782
00:59:46,302 --> 00:59:48,689
Let us go.
It has been a waste of travel charges.

783
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,425
When a candy floss seller became
the son-in-law of a rich family,

784
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:24,517
I thought it was his luck.

785
01:00:25,237 --> 01:00:29,385
When he wanted to own all the fields
and rename the village as Ekambarapuram,

786
01:00:29,463 --> 01:00:31,009
I thought my brother-in-law was crazy.

787
01:00:31,299 --> 01:00:32,634
But it was only last night that I realized.

788
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:35,598
You are neither lucky nor crazy.

789
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:37,181
You are shrewd, brother-in-law!

790
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,830
I was mad when even as his
dad collected the papers from me.

791
01:00:43,189 --> 01:00:46,103
When you call the whole village
and ask them to stay put here…

792
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:52,525
I don't like making enemies, man.

793
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,869
Why would I tolerate when
someone tries to challenge me?

794
01:01:22,748 --> 01:01:23,392
What's wrong?

795
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:27,486
I don't like it when you are dull
I just don't like it.

796
01:01:30,004 --> 01:01:31,470
Kiddo, just remember one thing in life.

797
01:01:32,434 --> 01:01:33,736
Everything comes with options.

798
01:01:34,777 --> 01:01:35,931
You should just let it go.

799
01:01:37,935 --> 01:01:39,626
Ok, Dad. I just want to go out.

800
01:01:40,004 --> 01:01:41,150
Sure, go. Who is stopping you?

801
01:01:41,855 --> 01:01:42,244
Hmm!

802
01:01:42,317 --> 01:01:44,619
Ok? That's like my girl. Come here.

803
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:49,036
Hey! Have you informed the
farm workers from the other village?

804
01:01:49,061 --> 01:01:50,205
I am on the same job.

805
01:01:53,464 --> 01:01:53,939
Son-in-law!

806
01:01:58,044 --> 01:02:00,041
We have thought deeply about what you said.

807
01:02:00,972 --> 01:02:02,416
This is a job we are well versed with.

808
01:02:02,909 --> 01:02:04,306
And it is a job we had done earlier.

809
01:02:04,981 --> 01:02:06,134
So why fear?

810
01:02:07,222 --> 01:02:08,314
It's not about the money you gave.

811
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:10,619
It's for the courage you
instilled that we felt like coming.

812
01:02:11,431 --> 01:02:14,080
Instead of staying idle in the village,
let us join you be active in the fields.

813
01:02:14,259 --> 01:02:15,650
Just tell us what to do.

814
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:20,134
Joint agriculture.

815
01:02:24,593 --> 01:02:25,853
Joint agriculture.

816
01:02:27,609 --> 01:02:29,119
Joint agriculture?
-Yes, bro.

817
01:02:30,172 --> 01:02:31,212
Unity is strength.

818
01:02:32,172 --> 01:02:34,244
That's why let us forget
the property boundaries.

819
01:02:35,468 --> 01:02:40,080
Let us consider this as
our joint farm and work.

820
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:43,758
It sounds nice. But what is the advantage?

821
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:52,830
Your crop yield may be high
but may not attract high price.

822
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:57,392
His crop yield may be less
but may have huge margins.

823
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:02,618
When we choose cooperative farming,
we can balance the loss and profit.

824
01:03:03,145 --> 01:03:08,212
Not only that…we have been rotating
the same crops for generations.

825
01:03:08,582 --> 01:03:09,306
Let us change that.

826
01:03:11,347 --> 01:03:12,759
We will raise them only on 20% of land.

827
01:03:13,175 --> 01:03:14,814
We shall raise new crops
on the remaining 80%.

828
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:16,853
I have five acres.

829
01:03:17,212 --> 01:03:18,314
It is totally useless.

830
01:03:18,682 --> 01:03:20,134
No land is useless, uncle.

831
01:03:20,683 --> 01:03:21,751
They raise crops in the desert these days.

832
01:03:22,567 --> 01:03:23,595
Let us test the soil.

833
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:26,337
Let us rotate the crops
as per season and soil.

834
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:30,626
Let us use novel technology.

835
01:03:31,535 --> 01:03:32,548
Let us make new trials.

836
01:03:33,675 --> 01:03:35,548
We have only targeted
the local market so far.

837
01:03:36,143 --> 01:03:38,205
But now let us tap the global market too.

838
01:03:39,933 --> 01:03:41,626
Let us keep our land and tools busy...

839
01:03:42,237 --> 01:03:44,876
...and bring home the yield
throughout the year without a break.

840
01:03:45,674 --> 01:03:47,017
Let us all be a group.

841
01:03:48,749 --> 01:03:50,072
When you wager alone, it is gambling.

842
01:03:50,989 --> 01:03:52,587
In a group, it becomes a war.

843
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:55,884
We won kingdoms when we fought together.

844
01:03:57,218 --> 01:03:58,423
We can win agriculture too.

845
01:03:58,726 --> 01:03:59,416
And we will.

846
01:04:23,161 --> 01:04:26,392
The only time I saw these many cows
was when I was still roaming in underpants.

847
01:04:27,429 --> 01:04:30,353
Why talk about your underpants now?
Go check the fodder for the cattle.

848
01:04:30,543 --> 01:04:31,767
Ok.
-Get going.

849
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:33,115
Carry on.
-Ravi!

850
01:04:34,439 --> 01:04:35,341
Hey.
-Hmm.

851
01:04:35,658 --> 01:04:38,712
Where did you get all these cows from?
-He got them from somewhere.

852
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:41,433
He says this one gives not
less than 15 liters of milk.

853
01:04:41,512 --> 01:04:44,087
Fifteen?!
-Yo! Don't go near!

854
01:04:44,428 --> 01:04:45,564
Oh God!

855
01:04:47,463 --> 01:04:48,186
Get going! Move!

856
01:04:50,143 --> 01:04:51,267
What is the need for all these now?

857
01:04:53,111 --> 01:04:56,376
Animals are as important
on a farm as the crop, uncle.

858
01:04:57,551 --> 01:05:00,515
If you could figure out what
is necessary and what is not,

859
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:02,380
you would be in America by now.

860
01:05:03,005 --> 01:05:04,942
Anyway, I guess this is your destiny.

861
01:05:05,456 --> 01:05:07,777
I will invest money. Set
up a business for yourself.

862
01:05:08,098 --> 01:05:09,243
I will help you myself!

863
01:05:10,075 --> 01:05:11,053
I like this work, uncle.

864
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:13,034
But I don't.

865
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:13,581
Huh?

866
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:17,267
I feel bad when
you undertake such jobs!

867
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:21,470
Ok, fine. I shall lead you
and take care of everything.

868
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,376
Forget the front
I am right behind you move.

869
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,251
Come...

870
01:05:28,536 --> 01:05:29,212
Hey!

871
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,056
Aha...

872
01:05:30,528 --> 01:05:32,353
Don't go that side
when they milk the cows.

873
01:05:32,378 --> 01:05:32,830
Why not?

874
01:05:32,998 --> 01:05:34,994
They may mistake you for a buffalo
and handle you too!

875
01:05:36,192 --> 01:05:37,025
Stinking idiot!

876
01:05:37,202 --> 01:05:38,439
Come...

877
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:40,828
Brother-in-law!
-Hmm?

878
01:05:41,755 --> 01:05:43,884
He looks pretty determined to do something.

879
01:05:44,184 --> 01:05:46,306
We should watch him in action.

880
01:05:46,621 --> 01:05:48,520
After all he is our guy. Let him do!

881
01:05:50,052 --> 01:05:52,900
Are all the bore wells ready?
-Hmm.

882
01:05:53,512 --> 01:05:55,306
Let us water the entire farm then.
-Okay.

883
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:57,861
Son-in-law!

884
01:05:58,463 --> 01:05:59,517
Do you think the water would be sufficient?

885
01:06:00,785 --> 01:06:03,720
If we stop the rest of the
bores, they will be sufficient.

886
01:06:04,855 --> 01:06:05,705
Right, right. Go ahead.

887
01:06:06,887 --> 01:06:07,962
This looks different!

888
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:11,220
This one, uncle? It is a
new variety called quinoa.

889
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,181
This one…It takes less
water and more sunlight.

890
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:17,259
Moreover, it is five times more
profitable than the rice we sell.

891
01:06:17,529 --> 01:06:18,673
My goodness! Is this so special?

892
01:06:18,867 --> 01:06:19,431
Then what?

893
01:06:19,818 --> 01:06:21,439
Hey! Is the motor ready?

894
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:22,337
Huh!

895
01:06:38,764 --> 01:06:39,728
Don't you understand?

896
01:06:40,265 --> 01:06:41,150
Don't you?

897
01:06:42,024 --> 01:06:45,103
Look, Chaitra! Certain
things are best left at that.

898
01:06:46,288 --> 01:06:48,228
Go to the city as your dad
suggested and be happy.

899
01:06:48,878 --> 01:06:50,384
Oye! Uncle Keshavulu!
-Hey!

900
01:06:54,868 --> 01:06:56,517
Uncle!
-Hey, What are you up to?

901
01:06:58,253 --> 01:07:00,330
Here, here, uncle!
-Hey!

902
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:04,767
Hey, what are you trying to do?
-Why?

903
01:07:05,304 --> 01:07:06,993
It's my uncle and my privilege
How are you bothered?

904
01:07:07,954 --> 01:07:08,759
Trying to act smart?

905
01:07:09,516 --> 01:07:12,212
Do you know how it would
be if I tried to act smart?

906
01:07:13,491 --> 01:07:16,741
He used to deflate my tire and
force me to go to the coffee shop, aunt!

907
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:18,528
What! Do you mean my son?!

908
01:07:19,047 --> 01:07:20,168
Yes, your very own son!

909
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:24,564
He used to be after me in the name of love.

910
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,970
Do you mean my son?!
-Yes, your very own son.

911
01:07:27,796 --> 01:07:30,462
Being a girl, I am supposed
to fall for him some day, right?

912
01:07:30,642 --> 01:07:31,666
So I fell in love.

913
01:07:31,771 --> 01:07:32,728
With my son?

914
01:07:33,036 --> 01:07:34,134
With your very own son.

915
01:07:34,606 --> 01:07:35,989
Not just that, aunt!

916
01:07:42,669 --> 01:07:43,814
Hey, brother!

917
01:07:44,418 --> 01:07:45,689
Stop it! I beg you!

918
01:07:47,472 --> 01:07:48,626
What shall we do now, brother-in-law?

919
01:07:49,989 --> 01:07:51,228
She has grown up with no idea of work.

920
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:53,275
She will run away once
she is given some work.

921
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:56,681
Oye!

922
01:07:57,809 --> 01:07:58,739
If you want to stay here,
you will have to work!

923
01:07:59,369 --> 01:08:00,501
Of course I am here to work.

924
01:08:00,817 --> 01:08:01,541
Let us do it!

925
01:08:03,501 --> 01:08:05,900
Wow! Your girl seems
to have picked a great job!

926
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:07,504
Isn't this a job?

927
01:08:07,575 --> 01:08:08,541
What? Picking grass?

928
01:08:09,267 --> 01:08:11,314
Oye! You call this work.

929
01:08:11,369 --> 01:08:11,900
Ohh!

930
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:14,580
Why? Do you think we can't do it?
-No one ask you to Picking grass?

931
01:08:15,055 --> 01:08:15,439
Aha...

932
01:08:17,082 --> 01:08:18,041
Come! Do it.

933
01:08:18,277 --> 01:08:19,408
I can do it too.
-Come!

934
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,056
Here.
-Get going.

935
01:08:30,864 --> 01:08:32,158
How are you tolerating this girl?

936
01:08:42,533 --> 01:08:43,341
Hmm... tell me.

937
01:08:43,366 --> 01:08:45,330
I asked the workers to come to
straighten the tree.

938
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:47,509
Ask them to come to the farm tomorrow
Let's straighten it out.

939
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:48,611
Ok brother-in-law.
-Hmm.

940
01:09:04,714 --> 01:09:05,728
Hey! What…

941
01:09:13,806 --> 01:09:16,212
What is this…half way through with food?

942
01:09:17,082 --> 01:09:20,056
I have made a mistake…by
passing on my responsibility to him.

943
01:09:23,348 --> 01:09:27,017
If I cleared my own debts, probably
he would have paid heed to me.

944
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:32,986
When did he disobey you all these years?

945
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:36,455
He likes the work. Let him make an attempt.

946
01:09:37,395 --> 01:09:39,892
See and learn some and
do and do and learn some.

947
01:09:40,443 --> 01:09:42,150
We shouldn't wait until we stumble.

948
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:46,189
I am worried he would
turn out to be like me.

949
01:09:55,321 --> 01:09:58,720
Such a huge tree giving shade
for years is bent over by wind.

950
01:09:58,745 --> 01:10:00,470
Uncle! Tie it to the other branch.

951
01:10:00,911 --> 01:10:01,353
Get behind.

952
01:10:05,114 --> 01:10:09,400
“Hold it fast…heigh ho
Grip it tight…heigh ho"

953
01:10:10,962 --> 01:10:15,806
"Lift it high…heigh ho
Hold it tight…heigh ho"

954
01:10:16,488 --> 01:10:23,400
"Hold it tight…heigh ho
Lift it high…heigh ho"

955
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:32,767
"Hold it tight…heigh ho
Lift it high…heigh ho"

956
01:10:34,413 --> 01:10:37,056
We're loosing the grip, Careful.

957
01:10:37,262 --> 01:10:38,603
Uncle..care full.

958
01:10:38,938 --> 01:10:40,390
Hold it.

959
01:10:40,854 --> 01:10:42,111
Don't leave.

960
01:11:05,815 --> 01:11:19,855
"Hold it tight…heigh ho"

961
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:03,741
Hey are you click the picture?

962
01:14:03,952 --> 01:14:07,928
This is an app
It captures plant diseases.

963
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:09,342
Wow! Simple superb.

964
01:14:21,064 --> 01:14:22,892
What is it? Why are you behind this?

965
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:27,024
This is dragon fruit, dad!
One kg is equal to a sack of grains.

966
01:14:27,049 --> 01:14:29,280
Oh, my! So it is a golden goose.

967
01:15:36,564 --> 01:15:37,135
Hey!

968
01:15:37,797 --> 01:15:38,968
Where are you taking that to?

969
01:15:39,064 --> 01:15:41,959
The buffalo is on heat
Taking it to a bull for a cross.

970
01:15:41,984 --> 01:15:44,455
Why do you need a bull for that?
I can cross it myself.

971
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,667
Hey!
-I will cross.

972
01:15:45,979 --> 01:15:47,838
What does he understand by crossing?
-What is it?

973
01:15:50,964 --> 01:15:51,838
Go away!

974
01:15:52,566 --> 01:15:54,034
Look at these kids!

975
01:16:10,573 --> 01:16:12,140
Dad! How come you are here!

976
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:13,393
You know what?

977
01:16:13,776 --> 01:16:16,260
I know where every
penny goes in my business.

978
01:16:16,433 --> 01:16:17,565
I am so careful!

979
01:16:18,363 --> 01:16:20,119
But where my daughter is going,

980
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:22,588
I couldn't find out.

981
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:24,541
I wanted to tell you, Dad.

982
01:16:25,236 --> 01:16:28,026
But if I told you, would you send me?

983
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:31,065
Obviously not. Why would I
send you to a place I don't like?

984
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,252
That's why I didn't inform you.

985
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:35,221
Crazy girl!

986
01:16:36,251 --> 01:16:39,369
You must be thinking you went to
the man you like without my knowledge.

987
01:16:40,627 --> 01:16:42,737
Karthik called me and
told me you were here.

988
01:16:43,674 --> 01:16:47,354
When I saw you I knew, Dad,
that Kartik has informed you.

989
01:16:48,947 --> 01:16:51,315
Though his girl is ready to marry him,

990
01:16:52,423 --> 01:16:56,791
He preferred calling you
Understand the guy.

991
01:16:57,175 --> 01:16:58,651
I am not here to argue with you.

992
01:16:59,707 --> 01:17:02,205
One last time…are you going with me or not?

993
01:17:02,582 --> 01:17:05,682
You were the one who told me,
Dad, that everything in life has options.

994
01:17:06,081 --> 01:17:11,026
But when it comes to
Kartik, I find no option for him.

995
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:17,862
Ok.

996
01:17:25,411 --> 01:17:27,674
So did you think I would
go away if you told him?

997
01:17:28,652 --> 01:17:30,369
Your dad says he doesn't like it
Why don't you let go?

998
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:32,541
Even your dad doesn't
like what you are doing.

999
01:17:32,894 --> 01:17:33,666
Why wouldn't you leave it?

1000
01:17:33,848 --> 01:17:35,041
You have learnt to talk.

1001
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,567
Oye! Why are you walking away?

1002
01:17:37,738 --> 01:17:39,604
Tell whoever you want but I
am not going to budge from here.

1003
01:17:40,449 --> 01:17:42,143
Hey, Ravi! What is that?

1004
01:17:42,511 --> 01:17:43,518
This is jeevamrutham…elixir for…

1005
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:45,041
All hard-workers are here.

1006
01:17:45,066 --> 01:17:46,448
Don't we deserve the elixir?

1007
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:48,635
As much as you want, Sir.

1008
01:17:48,693 --> 01:17:50,596
What is jeevamrutham?
-It's village whiskey.

1009
01:17:50,691 --> 01:17:52,182
Wow!
-Let's have some!

1010
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:57,335
Hey, Give me some, man!
-Sure. I will.

1011
01:17:58,145 --> 01:17:59,077
Just a little please.

1012
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:04,241
Is it good?

1013
01:18:05,077 --> 01:18:06,171
Have it.
-Okay!

1014
01:18:06,374 --> 01:18:09,042
It tastes fine but there
is a funny smell to it.

1015
01:18:09,067 --> 01:18:10,507
What do you expect
from dung mixed water?

1016
01:18:10,613 --> 01:18:11,799
Aha!

1017
01:18:13,952 --> 01:18:15,327
They boast of city but they know nothing.

1018
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:17,171
Hey, Edukondalu! Switch on the motor.

1019
01:18:17,327 --> 01:18:18,444
Oh no.

1020
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:21,718
Karthik's new project has come up.

1021
01:18:22,796 --> 01:18:24,413
They don't eaven pick the call.

1022
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:28,561
You call them they are listen.

1023
01:18:32,856 --> 01:18:35,202
Hey first finish your project
then come back.

1024
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,741
OKay bro..bye.
Take care.

1025
01:18:40,997 --> 01:18:41,632
Kartik!

1026
01:18:42,388 --> 01:18:43,718
Kartik!
-What is it?

1027
01:18:43,981 --> 01:18:45,913
There is a letter for your son.

1028
01:18:46,576 --> 01:18:47,335
He doesn't stay here.

1029
01:18:48,294 --> 01:18:49,093
Why do you say that?

1030
01:18:49,513 --> 01:18:50,632
Isn't your son with you?

1031
01:18:51,615 --> 01:18:53,327
Do you hear? He doesn't stay here.

1032
01:18:53,849 --> 01:18:55,288
Don't you get it? Go on.

1033
01:18:55,926 --> 01:18:58,397
But he is right here.
Why is he saying that?

1034
01:19:03,349 --> 01:19:06,483
He is good at what he is
doing. Why are you still angry?

1035
01:19:06,873 --> 01:19:08,561
Do you see anger?

1036
01:19:10,348 --> 01:19:12,819
Huh! As long as he doesn't pay heed what
difference does it make where he stays?

1037
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,733
What is it, man?

1038
01:19:25,266 --> 01:19:27,171
Take a look there, brother-in-law!

1039
01:19:34,877 --> 01:19:37,444
Hey, Can't you see?

1040
01:19:37,782 --> 01:19:39,554
Wait there! You…

1041
01:19:39,912 --> 01:19:40,591
What!

1042
01:19:40,627 --> 01:19:42,179
What are you staring at?

1043
01:19:42,243 --> 01:19:43,939
What is it that you are blabbering?

1044
01:19:44,329 --> 01:19:46,311
Hey! How dare you get drunk and act funny?

1045
01:19:46,507 --> 01:19:47,890
You are not afraid, because
no one questions, right?

1046
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:49,452
Call out! Call whoever you want to.
-I will!

1047
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,866
Where are you all from?

1048
01:20:31,057 --> 01:20:32,022
Come.

1049
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,702
Come here!

1050
01:20:51,102 --> 01:20:51,530
Come!

1051
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:52,890
Come!

1052
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:10,022
I called them to hit and chase
them away, brother-in-law.

1053
01:21:10,047 --> 01:21:10,507
What is it?

1054
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:12,358
Do you want to hit?

1055
01:21:13,188 --> 01:21:13,601
Get lost!

1056
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,327
You and your villainous ways! Get lost!

1057
01:21:40,587 --> 01:21:41,061
Hey!

1058
01:21:41,648 --> 01:21:44,968
Why don't you get down to work instead of
smoking away bidis and cigarettes all the time?

1059
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:10,702
I am full, aunt!
-Have some more, son. - Hey!

1060
01:22:10,727 --> 01:22:11,077
Hmm!

1061
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:13,771
You should never hesitate
about food and bed.

1062
01:22:13,782 --> 01:22:15,968
Stop it, husband! You
never check before speaking.

1063
01:22:15,993 --> 01:22:17,491
These are life's truths.

1064
01:22:17,759 --> 01:22:18,804
And we have seen it.

1065
01:22:18,829 --> 01:22:21,437
That's why, uncle, I eat by nine and sleep.

1066
01:22:21,829 --> 01:22:22,280
Hey!

1067
01:22:22,766 --> 01:22:26,163
Your life is good for nothing
except washing the cattle.

1068
01:22:27,415 --> 01:22:28,061
Come on!

1069
01:22:40,477 --> 01:22:40,874
Hey!

1070
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:43,061
What's wrong with you?

1071
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:48,554
I have wasted a lot of
food all these days, Kartik.

1072
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:50,921
I didn't know the value then.

1073
01:22:53,295 --> 01:22:54,968
I used to think money gets me food.

1074
01:22:55,937 --> 01:23:00,780
But after knowing the hardship
behind it,

1075
01:23:01,896 --> 01:23:02,983
I feel ashamed.

1076
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:06,468
I have come to know a lot and learnt a lot.

1077
01:23:07,787 --> 01:23:09,171
It's all because of you, Kartik.

1078
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,327
Brother Ramana called me last night, man.

1079
01:23:21,453 --> 01:23:23,374
Yes, he called me too.

1080
01:23:23,828 --> 01:23:25,343
He said farming is going
on well in the village.

1081
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:27,765
Yes, eaven I also hear.

1082
01:23:28,285 --> 01:23:29,640
Yes farming is going
on well in the village.

1083
01:23:30,077 --> 01:23:31,202
I would like to go back.

1084
01:23:33,624 --> 01:23:35,061
I feel like going back too.

1085
01:23:35,648 --> 01:23:36,757
But what if we get back to square one?

1086
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:41,147
A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.

1087
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:48,999
Hey, you are able to look after your
mom because of your job.

1088
01:23:49,499 --> 01:23:50,686
Give it a thought.

1089
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:55,413
Kabaddi…

1090
01:23:56,711 --> 01:23:57,929
Catch him…catch him…

1091
01:23:57,954 --> 01:23:58,983
Out!

1092
01:23:59,008 --> 01:24:00,779
Right!
-Out!

1093
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:03,655
Hey!

1094
01:24:03,722 --> 01:24:06,241
You cannot chant for half a minute without
a break. Why do you want to indulge?

1095
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:10,171
Hey, Balu! Step back.

1096
01:24:10,925 --> 01:24:13,405
Hey, you will be squished, man!

1097
01:24:13,476 --> 01:24:15,483
Do you take me for a
mosquito to be squished?

1098
01:24:15,854 --> 01:24:17,429
Hey, why are you sending him as raider?

1099
01:24:20,449 --> 01:24:22,267
Kabaddi…

1100
01:24:22,292 --> 01:24:25,741
Hey! Don't slap yourself
all over. It will be crushed.

1101
01:24:26,577 --> 01:24:29,046
Hey, Ravi!
-Yes, brother-in-law! Why did you call me?

1102
01:24:29,135 --> 01:24:30,843
I was just checking whether
you will respond or not.

1103
01:24:30,963 --> 01:24:32,323
Hey catch him!

1104
01:24:32,363 --> 01:24:34,007
Hey! He is out!

1105
01:24:34,032 --> 01:24:36,960
Unfair! He calls me.
-What do you mean unfair? Huh?

1106
01:24:37,148 --> 01:24:38,976
I will never play Kabaddi with you again.

1107
01:24:39,098 --> 01:24:40,311
Get lost!

1108
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:42,046
Here is the money, uncle.

1109
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:44,358
But you paid the salaries
only the other day.

1110
01:24:44,383 --> 01:24:46,749
That was salary
This is our common profit.

1111
01:24:51,008 --> 01:24:56,007
If everyone agrees, I want to do
something memorable using our first profit.

1112
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:57,030
What do you say?

1113
01:25:00,185 --> 01:25:02,507
Hey, whatever you do I am
sure you will do something good.

1114
01:25:02,977 --> 01:25:03,413
Go ahead.

1115
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:05,155
Not me, uncle.

1116
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,765
This is something you all must do together.

1117
01:25:10,778 --> 01:25:11,851
Hmm Ok.

1118
01:25:19,142 --> 01:25:20,093
What is this, brother-in-law?

1119
01:25:20,351 --> 01:25:22,827
When a married daughter
is still at mother's home,

1120
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:27,444
the anguish of her parents and the
silence at home are both unbearable.

1121
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:32,507
That's why Kartik suggested...

1122
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:38,890
...solving Raji's problem with our first
profit and make it a memorable deed.

1123
01:25:42,216 --> 01:25:45,491
We consented because what
could be a better thing to do?

1124
01:25:46,178 --> 01:25:47,788
What a great help you have extended!

1125
01:25:48,115 --> 01:25:50,858
When we wipe our own
tears, how can you call it help?

1126
01:25:51,302 --> 01:25:54,444
First go and make arrangements for
sending Raji to her in-laws.

1127
01:25:55,475 --> 01:25:55,976
Let's go.

1128
01:26:08,201 --> 01:26:10,202
What is this? I didn't like what he did.

1129
01:26:13,381 --> 01:26:15,030
Keshavulu then and this Raja now!

1130
01:26:15,733 --> 01:26:18,194
It looks like Kartik
will disturb your roots.

1131
01:26:18,545 --> 01:26:20,194
How come you are so cool!

1132
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:22,233
Why are you silent?

1133
01:26:25,123 --> 01:26:28,147
I took it casually and
wasted a lot of time.

1134
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,897
I won't give him a chance now.

1135
01:26:42,499 --> 01:26:45,163
What is all this?
-What do you mean?

1136
01:26:45,322 --> 01:26:48,843
They are looking all around for a good
match and so I brought them for our Bujji.

1137
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,874
They are also our distant relatives.

1138
01:26:54,131 --> 01:26:56,507
What is it? Why are you lost in thought?

1139
01:26:56,747 --> 01:26:59,413
They are big shots
I wonder if we can match up to them.

1140
01:27:00,372 --> 01:27:01,991
Good things happen unannounced.

1141
01:27:02,351 --> 01:27:03,640
I will take care of everything.

1142
01:27:03,826 --> 01:27:05,483
First, go and bring Bujji here. Go.

1143
01:27:06,031 --> 01:27:06,835
Go on!

1144
01:27:19,393 --> 01:27:19,968
Take it.

1145
01:27:21,738 --> 01:27:25,772
World is transforming but
not the bride offering tea.

1146
01:27:26,083 --> 01:27:27,694
Give him to some poison.

1147
01:27:27,897 --> 01:27:29,858
But why are you here, man? Go to the jeep.

1148
01:27:31,108 --> 01:27:33,124
I am not able to contact
him. I wonder where he is.

1149
01:27:33,358 --> 01:27:35,601
So, how is our Bujji?

1150
01:27:36,052 --> 01:27:38,327
As if I don't know her! She is gold.

1151
01:27:40,897 --> 01:27:42,257
Very good. I am glad.

1152
01:27:42,959 --> 01:27:45,671
Hey, why don't we decide
on the other thing too?

1153
01:27:46,555 --> 01:27:47,733
I told you, right?

1154
01:27:47,952 --> 01:27:50,272
Keshavulu has brought up his children well.

1155
01:27:50,429 --> 01:27:53,343
But he cannot offer millions as dowry.

1156
01:27:53,578 --> 01:27:56,429
Oh, no, brother! We have
enough wealth for generations.

1157
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:59,039
Why do we need dowry?
We only want the girl.

1158
01:27:59,064 --> 01:28:00,155
That will do, dear. What
you said is really great.

1159
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:02,516
It's...

1160
01:28:04,202 --> 01:28:05,846
It is your kindness to reject dowry.

1161
01:28:06,157 --> 01:28:10,033
But we shall conduct the
wedding equal to your status.

1162
01:28:11,955 --> 01:28:12,369
Hey!

1163
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:13,115
I will take care of it.

1164
01:28:13,476 --> 01:28:14,683
Ok, brother. As you wish.

1165
01:28:20,022 --> 01:28:21,397
Ok, Sir. Let us take leave of you.

1166
01:28:21,527 --> 01:28:22,209
Greetings!
-Greetings!

1167
01:28:24,456 --> 01:28:26,186
Let us meet on an auspicious
day to fix the wedding date.

1168
01:28:26,211 --> 01:28:27,389
Ok, brother.
-What do you say, Keshavulu?

1169
01:28:27,414 --> 01:28:27,826
Okay.

1170
01:28:28,357 --> 01:28:30,014
See you, brother.
-Take care.

1171
01:28:32,204 --> 01:28:34,647
Hey, Thanks!
-Hold it, man!

1172
01:28:35,014 --> 01:28:37,029
Who is a better well
wisher for Bujji than us?

1173
01:28:37,207 --> 01:28:38,498
Let me go now.

1174
01:28:38,987 --> 01:28:39,676
Hey, Ekambaram!

1175
01:28:40,738 --> 01:28:42,857
How much do you think it would
cost for the wedding approximately?

1176
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:44,470
They are big people.

1177
01:28:44,727 --> 01:28:45,790
They invite big people.

1178
01:28:46,313 --> 01:28:47,229
It will definitely be expensive.

1179
01:28:47,717 --> 01:28:49,516
How much approximately?
-Why do you worry?

1180
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:50,936
I am here. I will take care of the wedding.

1181
01:28:51,058 --> 01:28:51,956
You take care of the rest.

1182
01:28:52,338 --> 01:28:52,881
Ok.

1183
01:28:53,634 --> 01:28:55,725
Hey! How come you are late?

1184
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:57,733
Your sister's wedding
is fixed into a rich family.

1185
01:28:58,275 --> 01:28:59,641
Is it so, mom?
-Yes, dear.

1186
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:00,756
Hey, monkey!

1187
01:29:02,115 --> 01:29:03,553
See you, Keshava!
-Ok.

1188
01:29:03,774 --> 01:29:04,201
Hey, start the vehicle.

1189
01:29:04,517 --> 01:29:05,944
Let's get down to wedding arrangements.

1190
01:29:06,626 --> 01:29:09,861
Corona commotion in China.

1191
01:29:10,498 --> 01:29:14,265
World Health Organization
alerts the world nations.

1192
01:29:14,290 --> 01:29:16,217
Uncle, do you think we
should be careful too?

1193
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:17,131
No idea, man.

1194
01:29:17,705 --> 01:29:20,054
Hey, Is it our Prasad?
Stop the vehicle.

1195
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:22,592
Hey, Prasad!

1196
01:29:23,012 --> 01:29:23,389
Hmm!

1197
01:29:24,244 --> 01:29:24,905
Where to?

1198
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,428
I am going to the field, Sir.

1199
01:29:26,453 --> 01:29:27,578
It's on my way. Get in.

1200
01:29:27,743 --> 01:29:28,201
Ok.

1201
01:29:34,576 --> 01:29:35,951
What Prasad?
-Hmm!

1202
01:29:35,998 --> 01:29:38,115
You seem to be doing the
whole job all by yourself.

1203
01:29:38,509 --> 01:29:39,795
Nothing of that sort, Seenaiah.

1204
01:29:40,688 --> 01:29:41,694
I don't know, man!

1205
01:29:42,594 --> 01:29:44,563
If your grandfather were systematic,

1206
01:29:45,158 --> 01:29:47,873
you would be roaming in
a jeep or a car like me now.

1207
01:29:48,345 --> 01:29:50,240
Why do you say that,
brother-in-law? What is wrong now?

1208
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:51,858
What do you mean what happened?

1209
01:29:52,274 --> 01:29:54,035
He had set up a rice
mill with four partners.

1210
01:29:54,576 --> 01:29:56,684
All of them took his
grandfather for a ride.

1211
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:57,492
Ohh!

1212
01:29:57,517 --> 01:30:01,647
He had to sell everything and leave.

1213
01:30:04,514 --> 01:30:06,389
But he is also working
together with others.

1214
01:30:06,672 --> 01:30:08,295
That is what I am worried about.

1215
01:30:08,688 --> 01:30:12,069
All their hard work has gone
into releasing Raja's papers.

1216
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:16,514
I am worried he will
replicate his grandfather.

1217
01:30:17,748 --> 01:30:20,006
Also, he owns major
portion of these fields.

1218
01:30:21,045 --> 01:30:23,280
You reach the bank if
you paddle your own boat.

1219
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:29,115
When all get into the same boat,
you drown because of the weight.

1220
01:30:32,309 --> 01:30:34,287
The clever one will get
off the boat, of course.

1221
01:30:40,037 --> 01:30:40,748
Thank you sir.

1222
01:30:44,669 --> 01:30:45,928
Hey, Chandraiah!
-Hmm!

1223
01:30:46,056 --> 01:30:48,524
This rice crop is ready for reaping
Make sure water doesn't get in.

1224
01:30:48,549 --> 01:30:49,522
Ok.

1225
01:30:51,311 --> 01:30:52,014
Kartik…

1226
01:31:00,329 --> 01:31:01,389
What is this fancy dress?

1227
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:02,475
Did you say fancy dress?

1228
01:31:03,172 --> 01:31:04,936
Do you know how much effort I put in?

1229
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:07,912
For you.

1230
01:31:08,394 --> 01:31:11,170
I wanted to set up
scarecrows across the fields.

1231
01:31:11,559 --> 01:31:12,600
Now I don't need them.

1232
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:13,264
Hey!

1233
01:31:13,753 --> 01:31:14,358
Hey!

1234
01:31:15,058 --> 01:31:17,272
It took me two hours to put this on.

1235
01:31:17,477 --> 01:31:19,735
Can't you look at me
at least for two minutes?

1236
01:31:19,769 --> 01:31:20,772
Anyway, what is the matter?

1237
01:31:20,998 --> 01:31:22,248
Your younger sister is getting married.

1238
01:31:22,428 --> 01:31:23,342
Hmm, So?

1239
01:31:23,558 --> 01:31:25,178
It is our wedding next, right?

1240
01:31:25,589 --> 01:31:27,459
That's why I am getting used to this.

1241
01:31:27,861 --> 01:31:30,381
No wedding. Find someone else.

1242
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:33,908
I know. I am always after you
So you put me down.

1243
01:31:34,441 --> 01:31:35,199
I will leave.

1244
01:31:35,347 --> 01:31:36,615
That's a job done. Please do.

1245
01:31:37,211 --> 01:31:38,389
I am leaving for real.

1246
01:31:38,503 --> 01:31:39,209
Very good. Please leave.

1247
01:31:43,328 --> 01:31:46,467
Dear, dear, dear! What is it?
Why are you going that way?

1248
01:31:46,724 --> 01:31:47,780
Dear, please wait!

1249
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,983
Here, man.
-Hey! What is this?

1250
01:31:50,164 --> 01:31:52,358
Why do you make a girl cry at this hour?

1251
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:54,615
Wow! Why do you scold
me because she wants to cry?

1252
01:31:56,246 --> 01:31:58,037
Do something and stop the girl.

1253
01:31:58,216 --> 01:31:59,928
Take a morsel.
-Dear, dear!

1254
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:40,631
Hey, I told him not to water this bit.
Where the hell is he?

1255
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:44,826
Hey, Chandraiah!
-Yes, what is it?

1256
01:36:45,457 --> 01:36:47,287
You watered this bit
in spite of my warning.

1257
01:36:47,389 --> 01:36:49,506
See how badly it is damaged now.

1258
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:51,162
I had something to attend to.

1259
01:36:51,433 --> 01:36:53,409
You could have told me
I would have taken care.

1260
01:36:53,434 --> 01:36:55,115
Do you mean to say I did it on purpose?

1261
01:36:55,954 --> 01:36:58,240
Anyway it is my own bit. I will take care.

1262
01:36:58,398 --> 01:36:59,888
What do you mean you will take care?

1263
01:37:00,754 --> 01:37:03,238
Loss is not yours alone. It is everyone's.

1264
01:37:03,904 --> 01:37:07,677
You are only worried about your loss but
never about the other guy's difficulties.

1265
01:37:08,009 --> 01:37:09,990
Hey, Why are you beating around the bush?

1266
01:37:10,244 --> 01:37:11,232
Beating around the bush?

1267
01:37:11,627 --> 01:37:14,756
You have taken all our toil and
solved someone's problem. Why?

1268
01:37:14,972 --> 01:37:16,146
Don't we have problems?

1269
01:37:16,377 --> 01:37:18,357
All of you cheered to what Kartik said.

1270
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:19,623
Who will take care of our own needs?

1271
01:37:20,236 --> 01:37:21,349
That is all is your worry, right?

1272
01:37:21,690 --> 01:37:23,271
Let my son-in-law come.

1273
01:37:23,686 --> 01:37:25,263
You can take it the next time.

1274
01:37:25,425 --> 01:37:27,427
Hey, who are you to process it?

1275
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:29,732
How are you authorized to give me my share?

1276
01:37:30,033 --> 01:37:32,177
True, uncle. It doesn't look
like we are working together.

1277
01:37:32,283 --> 01:37:33,967
It's as if we are working under him.

1278
01:37:34,135 --> 01:37:35,974
Hey, childish brat! Shut your mouth.

1279
01:37:36,182 --> 01:37:38,474
Hey! Isn't he one of us?
What is wrong with his asking a question?

1280
01:37:38,499 --> 01:37:39,959
Isn't it wrong when he is
making false allegations?

1281
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:42,615
And you are backing him! Have you no sense?

1282
01:37:42,807 --> 01:37:45,052
There is no one here
more senseless than you.

1283
01:37:45,077 --> 01:37:45,748
Hey!
-Hey!

1284
01:37:46,099 --> 01:37:47,388
Hey! Don't slip your tongue.

1285
01:37:47,413 --> 01:37:48,584
Or what?

1286
01:37:48,609 --> 01:37:50,342
Wait!

1287
01:38:00,321 --> 01:38:00,766
Hey.

1288
01:38:01,183 --> 01:38:03,857
Sort out issues in your own field.
Move from here. Get lost!

1289
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:05,500
Come on, man.
-Let's go.

1290
01:38:19,245 --> 01:38:19,718
Uncle!

1291
01:38:20,511 --> 01:38:22,027
Uncle! What is this, uncle?

1292
01:38:22,284 --> 01:38:25,068
We are all here to work
together. Why fight?

1293
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:30,076
Uncle, if you think I
am at fault punish me.

1294
01:38:30,276 --> 01:38:32,143
Abuse me or hit me. But don't do this.

1295
01:38:32,862 --> 01:38:34,969
Hey, This is not an
issue that can be resolved.

1296
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:35,727
Leave me alone.

1297
01:38:36,027 --> 01:38:38,680
Hey, Where are you?

1298
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:42,071
Uncle! Please!
Listen to me this one time.

1299
01:38:42,768 --> 01:38:44,969
Aunt! At least you tell
him not to separate.

1300
01:38:45,799 --> 01:38:49,203
Ok, Uncle. As you say. Let's do as you say
What do you say?

1301
01:38:49,565 --> 01:38:52,453
Enough of this! I don't
want to repeat history.

1302
01:38:53,534 --> 01:38:54,211
Get inside!

1303
01:38:57,104 --> 01:38:59,164
What is this, dear? You
are making a grave mistake.

1304
01:38:59,877 --> 01:39:01,883
This separation is no good to us.
-Stop it!

1305
01:39:02,564 --> 01:39:03,571
Everyone seems to be wiser here!

1306
01:39:03,908 --> 01:39:06,625
I know what to do.
Mind your business.

1307
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:12,893
We were slogging somewhere and he
invested to bring us here and gave us work.

1308
01:39:12,939 --> 01:39:14,461
What investment? What bloody investment?!

1309
01:39:15,136 --> 01:39:16,670
We own a quarter of the entire fields.

1310
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:18,907
But the crop is as it is in our bit.

1311
01:39:19,175 --> 01:39:20,750
I will sell it and repay him. You carry on!

1312
01:39:41,862 --> 01:39:46,250
What started as a drizzle
escalated into a storm!

1313
01:39:46,322 --> 01:39:49,821
Everything makes sense except
the wedding plan, brother-in-law.

1314
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:53,289
Go and hand this over to Keshavulu.

1315
01:39:53,494 --> 01:39:53,899
Then what?

1316
01:39:54,437 --> 01:39:56,489
But he won't accept money for free.

1317
01:39:56,906 --> 01:39:57,447
Ohh!

1318
01:39:58,908 --> 01:40:00,282
MRO!
-Sir?

1319
01:40:01,054 --> 01:40:03,672
Be prepared to transfer
all the fields in my name.

1320
01:40:14,656 --> 01:40:14,922
Hello!

1321
01:40:15,224 --> 01:40:16,789
Your products are not
delivered in the past four days.

1322
01:40:17,153 --> 01:40:20,071
This cannot go on. We will
have to look for an alternative.

1323
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:21,218
Ball is in your court, Kartik.

1324
01:40:24,794 --> 01:40:25,922
Who was on the phone, son-in-law?

1325
01:40:26,949 --> 01:40:28,025
From the supermarket, uncle.

1326
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:29,816
They are pressurizing for the load.

1327
01:40:30,224 --> 01:40:31,328
Let us send it, then.

1328
01:40:31,614 --> 01:40:32,536
How can we send it, uncle?

1329
01:40:32,825 --> 01:40:34,967
The product is in Chandram uncle's bit.

1330
01:40:42,730 --> 01:40:43,618
What is this, Kartik?

1331
01:40:43,848 --> 01:40:46,422
If you get discouraged,
what about the others?

1332
01:40:46,864 --> 01:40:48,985
Come to the fields quick.
There is a lot to do.

1333
01:40:49,965 --> 01:40:50,477
Ok?

1334
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:02,649
Hmm.

1335
01:41:06,552 --> 01:41:07,469
Why have you come here, mom?

1336
01:41:07,919 --> 01:41:09,211
If you called me, I would come myself.

1337
01:41:09,573 --> 01:41:11,081
Your dad wanted to come.

1338
01:41:16,058 --> 01:41:17,414
We need your signature on this.

1339
01:41:17,684 --> 01:41:19,821
Just for signature? Hey, get me a pen.

1340
01:41:20,618 --> 01:41:21,727
Your younger sister is
getting married, right?

1341
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:23,180
We have decided to sell the land.

1342
01:41:27,157 --> 01:41:29,250
But why sell the land for her wedding?

1343
01:41:30,105 --> 01:41:31,289
I can arrange the money myself.

1344
01:41:31,435 --> 01:41:32,641
No one need arrange.

1345
01:41:34,637 --> 01:41:36,243
I know how to conduct
my daughter's wedding.

1346
01:41:36,685 --> 01:41:37,774
Just ask him to sign the paper.

1347
01:41:38,129 --> 01:41:40,563
Why do you say that, Dad?
After all, she is my sister.

1348
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:42,016
I have a responsibility too.

1349
01:41:42,794 --> 01:41:44,711
I made a mistake giving
you my responsibility once.

1350
01:41:45,591 --> 01:41:48,133
I don't want to repeat it
and be deceived.

1351
01:41:50,528 --> 01:41:51,250
Sign it!

1352
01:41:52,403 --> 01:41:53,875
Dad! Please hear me out once.

1353
01:41:59,839 --> 01:42:00,664
So you refuse to sign!

1354
01:42:06,379 --> 01:42:06,805
OK.

1355
01:42:10,238 --> 01:42:11,117
I know how to dispose it.

1356
01:42:17,051 --> 01:42:17,375
Dad!

1357
01:42:18,597 --> 01:42:21,774
The land is in grandpa's name.
You would need my signature for sure.

1358
01:42:27,809 --> 01:42:29,235
You won't be able to sell
it without my signature.

1359
01:42:41,261 --> 01:42:43,821
Do you realize who you are talking to?

1360
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:48,282
You were away in the hostel
and would ask him for money.

1361
01:42:49,908 --> 01:42:51,696
He wouldn't even finish his meal

1362
01:42:52,192 --> 01:42:55,500
But ask someone or the other,
arrange it and send it to you.

1363
01:42:56,925 --> 01:42:58,399
And is this how you speak to him?

1364
01:43:00,699 --> 01:43:03,891
If you are willing to sign, say
so. Otherwise say you won't.

1365
01:43:04,464 --> 01:43:08,328
But if you draw lines between your
grandpa's property and your property,

1366
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:09,485
I will kill you!

1367
01:43:09,691 --> 01:43:11,539
Parvati! Enough talk! Let's go.

1368
01:43:12,488 --> 01:43:12,805
Come.

1369
01:43:31,975 --> 01:43:34,286
Husband! Please give it a second thought.

1370
01:43:35,779 --> 01:43:37,106
I thought he was ignoring my words.

1371
01:43:37,904 --> 01:43:39,575
But I never thought he
would use such words!

1372
01:43:40,591 --> 01:43:41,895
May be by mistake…

1373
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:43,629
What mistake?

1374
01:43:44,895 --> 01:43:46,168
Today he said the land
belonged to his grandfather.

1375
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:47,442
What if he says the same about this house?

1376
01:43:50,459 --> 01:43:52,882
When an outsider says something we
remember it only when we meet them.

1377
01:43:53,187 --> 01:43:55,856
But when a family member
says it, the pain is perpetual.

1378
01:44:00,268 --> 01:44:02,957
It is good to be as far away as
possible from certain memories.

1379
01:44:04,109 --> 01:44:04,520
Get going.

1380
01:44:07,458 --> 01:44:09,356
Hey, Kartik!

1381
01:44:09,786 --> 01:44:11,403
uncle is leaving the village..

1382
01:45:14,055 --> 01:45:15,934
Hey! Do you see what you have done?

1383
01:45:16,344 --> 01:45:17,614
Has the land become more valuable to you?

1384
01:45:17,642 --> 01:45:19,801
Hey! Nothing is more
valuable to me than my father.

1385
01:45:20,876 --> 01:45:22,486
Really? Then why don't you sign, huh?

1386
01:45:23,852 --> 01:45:25,825
Only the other day I requested
Chandram uncle not to go separate.

1387
01:45:26,929 --> 01:45:28,783
Now if I sell my own land,
what would others think?

1388
01:45:30,454 --> 01:45:33,629
They would feel betrayed
because they are here trusting me.

1389
01:45:34,234 --> 01:45:36,418
Why do you bother about
people who don't care about you?

1390
01:45:36,616 --> 01:45:37,996
Let them meet their fate.

1391
01:45:38,257 --> 01:45:39,371
They made a mistake unknowingly.

1392
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:41,156
I cannot make the same mistake knowingly.

1393
01:45:42,928 --> 01:45:44,856
In any case, the value of my
signature is not just on that paper.

1394
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:46,703
It is also in my upbringing by dad.

1395
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:49,272
I can never ruin that.

1396
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:02,809
Corona breaks out across India.

1397
01:46:03,038 --> 01:46:04,864
The central government
has announced lockdown.

1398
01:46:05,163 --> 01:46:07,520
'From 12 at midnight,

1399
01:46:09,108 --> 01:46:13,165
The whole of India will
come under total lockdown.

1400
01:46:13,646 --> 01:46:17,364
This is also a kind of curfew.

1401
01:46:18,193 --> 01:46:20,356
Every resident shall
consider this as a priority.'

1402
01:46:28,879 --> 01:46:30,614
The whole country has come to a standstill.

1403
01:46:30,795 --> 01:46:34,348
With the markets closed down,
farmers face severe problems.

1404
01:46:35,926 --> 01:46:37,637
They are not allowing vehicles on the road.

1405
01:46:37,845 --> 01:46:39,786
After we plucked the fruit,
we are stuck with corona!

1406
01:46:45,505 --> 01:46:49,262
Brother-in-law! Kartik is
receiving blow after blow.

1407
01:46:49,711 --> 01:46:51,309
He talked about joint agriculture
and now they are separated.

1408
01:46:51,693 --> 01:46:53,645
Family has deserted him.

1409
01:46:53,879 --> 01:46:55,559
On top of that corona
has given the biggest blow.

1410
01:46:55,868 --> 01:46:59,270
You found a horse shoe, brother-in-law!

1411
01:46:59,958 --> 01:47:02,059
I am sorry, Kartik. We cannot offer more.

1412
01:47:04,035 --> 01:47:05,262
They are offering very little, man!

1413
01:47:09,746 --> 01:47:11,207
The crop is going to be spoilt.

1414
01:47:12,076 --> 01:47:14,856
Uncle! You are worried
about a damaged crop.

1415
01:47:15,661 --> 01:47:17,154
Is anyone worried about him?

1416
01:47:19,184 --> 01:47:23,700
He gave up a million rupee salary, disowned
his family and came here to work with us.

1417
01:47:24,825 --> 01:47:26,928
All those whom he trusted,
went their own ways.

1418
01:47:27,746 --> 01:47:29,716
The situation in the
market now is pretty bad.

1419
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:32,630
His life is ruined for no reason.

1420
01:47:42,799 --> 01:47:47,559
Due to lockdown, the daily
provisions reach their highest price.

1421
01:47:47,741 --> 01:47:50,411
We are worried not knowing
how to dispose the produce.

1422
01:47:50,676 --> 01:47:53,348
How are they selling it for so high?

1423
01:47:56,708 --> 01:47:58,605
By the way, how many followers
do we have on our social media?

1424
01:47:59,239 --> 01:48:00,366
More than two lakhs.

1425
01:48:04,963 --> 01:48:05,511
Ready!

1426
01:48:07,013 --> 01:48:08,315
Hi, I am Kartik.

1427
01:48:08,873 --> 01:48:10,617
It's a great pleasure
meeting you all this way.

1428
01:48:10,912 --> 01:48:16,808
You are all aware corona has made
our thoughts revolve around healthy food.

1429
01:48:18,737 --> 01:48:21,179
What to buy is fearsome and
where to buy is a big question.

1430
01:48:23,619 --> 01:48:27,495
Our brand Srikaaram is the
answer to many questions.

1431
01:48:31,252 --> 01:48:35,245
We tend to our crops as carefully
as a father does with his child.

1432
01:48:40,103 --> 01:48:42,987
You can watch the way
we farm on live streaming…

1433
01:48:45,101 --> 01:48:45,936
live farming.

1434
01:48:46,228 --> 01:48:47,791
You can place orders
as per your requirement.

1435
01:48:48,337 --> 01:48:49,864
You don't have to step
in to the market for this.

1436
01:48:50,221 --> 01:48:52,029
Our Srikaaram brand
will be at your doorstep.

1437
01:48:54,229 --> 01:48:56,870
Farmer to customer…no one else between.

1438
01:48:58,510 --> 01:49:00,284
Wherever you are, however remote,

1439
01:49:00,853 --> 01:49:03,745
our men will knock at your
door before your milkman does.

1440
01:49:04,088 --> 01:49:05,470
Stay home. Stay safe.

1441
01:49:05,526 --> 01:49:06,698
We know the value of hunger.

1442
01:49:07,315 --> 01:49:08,629
We definitely understand your needs.

1443
01:49:18,829 --> 01:49:21,151
Brother Prasad! The workers
are asking for their wages.

1444
01:49:23,172 --> 01:49:25,612
Our needs have increased
and there is no sign of work.

1445
01:49:26,564 --> 01:49:28,721
Do something, brother
I am not able to answer them.

1446
01:49:30,134 --> 01:49:32,831
What is this, uncle? We were hoping for
the best and everything turned upside down.

1447
01:49:34,854 --> 01:49:35,198
Hey!

1448
01:49:36,151 --> 01:49:38,354
May be it's better we meet Kartik once.

1449
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:41,179
How can you face him?

1450
01:49:42,908 --> 01:49:44,094
Have some shame.

1451
01:49:45,884 --> 01:49:48,737
How much he had
requested you not to separate!

1452
01:49:48,963 --> 01:49:50,118
No one cared to listen.

1453
01:49:52,213 --> 01:49:52,963
Why would they listen?

1454
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:55,807
They say one thing on empty
stomach and one thing on a full one.

1455
01:49:58,033 --> 01:50:00,620
He distanced his family for our sake.

1456
01:50:01,181 --> 01:50:01,885
And you…

1457
01:50:02,681 --> 01:50:04,651
You are approaching him for your needs.

1458
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:06,557
Why, aunt!

1459
01:50:07,181 --> 01:50:09,206
Why do you use big words like far and near?

1460
01:50:09,666 --> 01:50:11,315
Wow! That's a great crop!

1461
01:50:11,955 --> 01:50:13,291
Send it to the shed, uncle
We will market it.

1462
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:15,698
Hey, Kartik! These people…
-Stop it, aunt.

1463
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,010
Send it, uncle. We will do something.
-Hey, Kartik!

1464
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,034
I made a mistake, man.

1465
01:50:22,417 --> 01:50:24,791
It's ok, uncle
There are no mistakes in family.

1466
01:50:25,924 --> 01:50:28,448
As if you and aunt never quarreled in life!

1467
01:50:30,923 --> 01:50:32,995
Did you go separate because you quarreled?
It's the same with us.

1468
01:50:33,243 --> 01:50:36,956
Let us argue, let us fight
but let us stay together.

1469
01:50:37,088 --> 01:50:37,637
What do you say?

1470
01:50:40,784 --> 01:50:41,541
Hey, Prasad!

1471
01:50:41,952 --> 01:50:42,315
Hmm!

1472
01:50:43,259 --> 01:50:43,803
Son-in-law!

1473
01:50:44,478 --> 01:50:46,081
Lots of calls coming in
from the other Mandals.

1474
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:47,909
Asking us to sell the crop for them.

1475
01:50:48,523 --> 01:50:50,206
Hey, See?

1476
01:50:50,987 --> 01:50:53,635
Hey, Kartik! There is a terrific
response to your video, man!

1477
01:50:53,796 --> 01:50:54,791
Orders are as fast.

1478
01:50:55,007 --> 01:50:57,174
We better maintain as
much stock as possible.

1479
01:51:02,319 --> 01:51:04,752
Hey, all these are farmers
from our neighbouring villages.

1480
01:52:23,366 --> 01:52:23,662
Brother in law.

1481
01:52:24,101 --> 01:52:26,049
The contractor is ready to
hike the wages if we stay here.

1482
01:52:26,241 --> 01:52:26,752
No, man.

1483
01:52:27,171 --> 01:52:29,510
We already made a mistake not
going back when Kartik called us.

1484
01:52:29,725 --> 01:52:31,784
We can't make another mistake
staying back now. We will go.

1485
01:52:32,061 --> 01:52:33,979
Hey, wait. I will go with you too.
-Let's go.

1486
01:52:57,138 --> 01:52:57,593
Hello.

1487
01:52:59,379 --> 01:53:00,698
Get ready for the Farmers' Day Sale.

1488
01:53:01,536 --> 01:53:02,495
Farmers' Day Sale?

1489
01:53:03,006 --> 01:53:04,041
It's a terrific idea.

1490
01:53:05,263 --> 01:53:06,659
We have seen gadgets and clothes on offer.

1491
01:53:06,876 --> 01:53:08,479
For the first time he is
announcing offers on crops.

1492
01:53:22,108 --> 01:53:24,901
Joint farming is a novel trend.

1493
01:53:24,991 --> 01:53:27,041
Bringing the whole village together.

1494
01:53:27,315 --> 01:53:29,885
Turning farming into a profitable venture.

1495
01:53:29,910 --> 01:53:32,924
This young farmer becomes
the new idol for the youth.

1496
01:53:36,030 --> 01:53:38,065
Our college 25 annual celebrations.

1497
01:53:38,243 --> 01:53:40,026
You have to be there a chief guest kartik.

1498
01:53:51,877 --> 01:53:52,919
You keep getting drunk, brother-in-law.

1499
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:55,854
They are ready to take their papers
with all the money they have earned.

1500
01:53:56,153 --> 01:53:56,736
Hey!

1501
01:53:57,526 --> 01:53:59,143
Send as many as you want.

1502
01:53:59,645 --> 01:54:01,479
Not a single person should
come to me with money.

1503
01:54:02,301 --> 01:54:03,147
Do whatever you want to.

1504
01:54:10,855 --> 01:54:12,665
Karthik, I have to tell you something.

1505
01:54:22,167 --> 01:54:22,874
Be right back.

1506
01:54:23,809 --> 01:54:25,604
I think he came to know our dirty job.

1507
01:54:26,557 --> 01:54:27,713
What is this?

1508
01:54:28,644 --> 01:54:29,510
Why are you doing this?

1509
01:54:32,447 --> 01:54:35,479
Not one or two…it's my
dream of twenty five years.

1510
01:54:36,026 --> 01:54:37,393
Ekambarapuram!

1511
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:40,995
You have destroyed it all!

1512
01:54:42,018 --> 01:54:42,979
If only you could join!

1513
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:47,885
Four people together make a house.
A few houses make a street.

1514
01:54:48,174 --> 01:54:50,458
A few streets make a village.

1515
01:54:50,784 --> 01:54:55,346
Do you want to send away everyone and make
this village solitary just like your name?

1516
01:54:56,348 --> 01:54:57,788
You are making a big mistake, uncle.

1517
01:54:59,793 --> 01:55:02,870
This village is not named after your
father-in-law because he had given his lands.

1518
01:55:05,019 --> 01:55:07,360
They named it after him in
memory of all his good deeds.

1519
01:55:08,674 --> 01:55:09,846
Then where is my recognition?

1520
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:14,354
Everyone refers to me as
the son-in-law of Mr Anantraju.

1521
01:55:15,651 --> 01:55:17,174
Why don't they look at me for what I am!
-They won't.

1522
01:55:18,104 --> 01:55:18,776
They cannot, uncle.

1523
01:55:20,684 --> 01:55:24,627
Because after the gentleman
died, they see him in you.

1524
01:55:29,283 --> 01:55:31,338
Whoever enters the village
first meets you and then go home.

1525
01:55:32,230 --> 01:55:33,643
That is the kind of
respect they have for you.

1526
01:55:34,259 --> 01:55:35,875
They don't think you
lend them money, uncle.

1527
01:55:37,004 --> 01:55:38,245
They think you are helping them.

1528
01:55:45,946 --> 01:55:47,093
I am not old enough to advise you.

1529
01:55:48,921 --> 01:55:51,281
In difficulties, people
find God even in stone.

1530
01:55:52,157 --> 01:55:54,085
If they realize you are not God but just
a stone, they won't be able to take it.

1531
01:56:07,289 --> 01:56:14,171
The youngster who showed how an educated youth
handles agriculture happens to be our student.

1532
01:56:14,281 --> 01:56:16,640
He makes us and the college proud.

1533
01:56:17,288 --> 01:56:20,140
Now I invite Mr Kartik
to speak a few words.

1534
01:56:27,571 --> 01:56:28,913
Congrats, Kartik!
-Thank you, Sir.

1535
01:56:30,938 --> 01:56:31,476
How are you all?

1536
01:56:33,423 --> 01:56:35,984
It's a great feeling,
man, to see you all here.

1537
01:56:37,915 --> 01:56:39,952
Let me not be the only speaker
just because they have invited me.

1538
01:56:41,210 --> 01:56:43,526
Let us all talk together. Ok?

1539
01:56:46,412 --> 01:56:46,902
Ok.

1540
01:56:47,915 --> 01:56:50,398
After graduation, what
are you all planning to do?

1541
01:56:50,506 --> 01:56:52,226
Hardly any choice, brother.
Computer Science group.

1542
01:56:52,631 --> 01:56:54,499
So I will take up a software job.

1543
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:55,202
Hmm

1544
01:56:55,799 --> 01:56:57,515
I am trying to appear
for Civil Services, Sir.

1545
01:56:58,078 --> 01:56:58,640
Oh!

1546
01:56:59,046 --> 01:57:00,476
I am doing Mechanical Engineering, brother.

1547
01:57:00,518 --> 01:57:03,749
But they pay high salaries in software
So I am planning to jump.

1548
01:57:04,648 --> 01:57:05,812
Very good.

1549
01:57:07,331 --> 01:57:08,781
I don't know if you are all aware.

1550
01:57:10,331 --> 01:57:13,163
For the nine lakh students
stepping out of colleges every year,

1551
01:57:14,596 --> 01:57:16,781
there are only three lakh jobs.

1552
01:57:17,619 --> 01:57:18,812
What about the rest?

1553
01:57:20,822 --> 01:57:21,710
If they find jobs, well and good.

1554
01:57:23,206 --> 01:57:23,848
But if they don't?

1555
01:57:26,033 --> 01:57:29,893
As time passes, pressure mounts at home.

1556
01:57:30,495 --> 01:57:32,395
On the other hand,
pressure from girl friends.

1557
01:57:32,885 --> 01:57:36,085
You have them right…who keep saying
they are looking for matches at home.

1558
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:39,249
Amidst all this …

1559
01:57:40,087 --> 01:57:45,609
Friends, strangers, and neighbours ask one
question in spite of knowing everything.

1560
01:57:46,321 --> 01:57:49,070
Why? No job yet?

1561
01:57:49,884 --> 01:57:50,734
Still free?

1562
01:57:50,993 --> 01:57:52,163
They are ask.

1563
01:57:54,975 --> 01:57:58,421
In that situation, we are
ready to take up any job.

1564
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:03,007
Finally when we get the offer,
we are ready to go even to Uganda.

1565
01:58:05,218 --> 01:58:07,492
What you say is true, brother.
But what is the solution?

1566
01:58:07,559 --> 01:58:08,367
I am getting there.

1567
01:58:09,371 --> 01:58:12,671
When did we first know we
can turn software into a career?

1568
01:58:13,770 --> 01:58:15,070
After Y2K problem, brother.

1569
01:58:15,363 --> 01:58:15,788
Yes.

1570
01:58:16,566 --> 01:58:19,445
Opportunities that were in
thousands till then, turned into lakhs.

1571
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:22,077
There was a sudden software boom.

1572
01:58:23,098 --> 01:58:26,031
Even those who didn't cross the
village borders, started going abroad.

1573
01:58:28,246 --> 01:58:30,288
Do you wonder why? Shortage.

1574
01:58:31,644 --> 01:58:33,070
Same is the case with civil engineering.

1575
01:58:34,472 --> 01:58:37,046
It was considered useless to study or
to make someone study civil engineering.

1576
01:58:38,395 --> 01:58:40,038
Then there was a sudden real estate boom.

1577
01:58:42,112 --> 01:58:42,781
You know the rest.

1578
01:58:43,621 --> 01:58:43,929
Why?

1579
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:45,304
Because of shortage.

1580
01:58:47,133 --> 01:58:47,968
So many careers like this.

1581
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:49,859
Do you know what the
next trending field is?

1582
01:58:52,285 --> 01:58:52,851
Farming.

1583
01:58:53,611 --> 01:58:54,734
Farming?

1584
01:58:55,692 --> 01:58:56,202
Farming!

1585
01:58:58,285 --> 01:58:59,023
Do you wonder why?

1586
01:59:01,059 --> 01:59:01,695
By the way,

1587
01:59:02,731 --> 01:59:04,007
How many of your grandfathers were farmers?

1588
01:59:07,541 --> 01:59:08,218
What about your dads?

1589
01:59:13,509 --> 01:59:13,959
See?

1590
01:59:14,384 --> 01:59:15,851
Agriculture was so much
during our grandfathers' time.

1591
01:59:17,657 --> 01:59:19,218
But during our fathers' time?

1592
01:59:21,854 --> 01:59:22,421
But now?

1593
01:59:24,584 --> 01:59:24,984
Tomorrow?

1594
01:59:25,977 --> 01:59:30,452
It may come to the point, where we
say there used to be agriculture here.

1595
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:38,070
There are numerous mouths to feed
but very few hands to produce food.

1596
01:59:40,604 --> 01:59:42,281
We have a great opportunity here.

1597
01:59:42,869 --> 01:59:45,734
We have a very good chance of
exploring farming and agriculture.

1598
01:59:47,908 --> 01:59:50,499
Till now it is believed only the
illiterate lean towards farming.

1599
01:59:52,526 --> 01:59:53,202
From now on,

1600
01:59:54,619 --> 01:59:56,124
even the educated
shall get into farming.

1601
01:59:57,672 --> 01:59:58,820
It will be good, if they do.

1602
01:59:59,196 --> 02:00:00,960
With the help of
technology and information,

1603
02:00:01,361 --> 02:00:02,239
we can do wonders.

1604
02:00:03,141 --> 02:00:04,156
Like any other profession,

1605
02:00:04,976 --> 02:00:06,562
we should be proudly declaring
ourselves to be farmers.

1606
02:00:07,899 --> 02:00:11,624
We shall pick up from where the
previous generation has stopped.

1607
02:00:12,744 --> 02:00:14,570
Because farming is in our blood.

1608
02:00:16,174 --> 02:00:19,737
We shall become the bridges of transition
from this generation to the next.

1609
02:00:23,009 --> 02:00:25,718
We considered only law, medicine
and engineering as careers.

1610
02:00:26,054 --> 02:00:29,242
We see now that farming is also a career,
brother.

1611
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,818
We will definitely try, brother.

1612
02:00:32,048 --> 02:00:32,701
Yes, Sir.

1613
02:00:33,365 --> 02:00:35,350
Having seen your success,

1614
02:00:35,533 --> 02:00:37,389
we don't see why we shouldn't
consider farming as an option.

1615
02:00:37,482 --> 02:00:39,561
Yes.

1616
02:00:41,587 --> 02:00:43,897
You have come here
today and inspired so many.

1617
02:00:44,212 --> 02:00:45,553
But who is your inspiration, brother?

1618
02:00:50,938 --> 02:00:51,623
Keshavulu.

1619
02:00:56,383 --> 02:00:57,037
My Dad.

1620
02:01:00,524 --> 02:01:01,834
When I was seven years old,

1621
02:01:02,905 --> 02:01:04,686
My dad used to take
me to the field every day.

1622
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:12,311
He taught me how to remove
weed and how to turn the hoe.

1623
02:01:13,492 --> 02:01:15,615
As I grew up, my interest in
agriculture also grew along.

1624
02:01:16,446 --> 02:01:19,022
But for my father it was
his anxiety that kept growing.

1625
02:01:24,734 --> 02:01:28,834
As my father grew more anxious,
He started distancing me from the field.

1626
02:01:30,414 --> 02:01:31,390
Amidst all that anxiety…

1627
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:33,519
Son!

1628
02:01:35,131 --> 02:01:36,092
I really slog.

1629
02:01:37,649 --> 02:01:39,373
But there is no result.

1630
02:01:40,396 --> 02:01:42,529
You cared for your parents and family well.

1631
02:01:44,128 --> 02:01:47,693
But I am not able to care
for you and my own family.

1632
02:01:49,786 --> 02:01:51,201
When it came to me,

1633
02:01:54,418 --> 02:01:56,577
Even the soil refuses to budge.

1634
02:01:58,637 --> 02:02:03,623
I am afraid it was a mistake
to take up farming, father.

1635
02:02:07,931 --> 02:02:09,818
Normally people draw
inspiration from success.

1636
02:02:11,566 --> 02:02:12,404
But..

1637
02:02:13,964 --> 02:02:16,190
I drew inspiration from my dad's setbacks.

1638
02:02:20,816 --> 02:02:22,889
You are doing a noble
job of feeding people.

1639
02:02:23,682 --> 02:02:26,217
I wanted to scream and tell him,
This is no mistake.

1640
02:02:27,731 --> 02:02:28,201
But

1641
02:02:30,769 --> 02:02:31,865
I couldn't tell him that day.

1642
02:02:36,504 --> 02:02:37,131
But now, here,

1643
02:02:37,730 --> 02:02:39,615
I want to tell him loud,
clear and with pride.

1644
02:02:41,332 --> 02:02:44,881
Dad! I stand here today not because of my
job

1645
02:02:46,423 --> 02:02:47,795
But because of the farming you taught me.

1646
02:02:53,031 --> 02:02:54,850
I walked the soil he had trodden.

1647
02:02:56,884 --> 02:02:58,428
That is what led me towards victory.

1648
02:03:01,257 --> 02:03:02,701
The first step to my victory is..

1649
02:03:04,121 --> 02:03:04,725
My Dad.

1650
02:03:06,935 --> 02:03:08,466
My father is my inspiration.

1651
02:03:34,111 --> 02:03:35,256
Anantharajupuram.

1652
02:04:41,309 --> 02:04:42,213
Forgive me.

1653
02:05:09,226 --> 02:05:09,709
Keep it.

1654
02:05:10,086 --> 02:05:10,936
It makes you strong.

1655
02:05:25,045 --> 02:05:25,537
Son-in-law!

1656
02:05:47,217 --> 02:05:47,746
Jyoti!

1657
02:05:54,384 --> 02:05:57,045
Hey, why the talk? Focus on work.

1658
02:06:02,771 --> 02:06:04,428
Hey, Make it fast.

1659
02:06:41,832 --> 02:06:42,639
Happy?

1660
02:06:48,406 --> 02:06:49,115
It's ours next.

1661
02:06:50,117 --> 02:06:51,647
Aha! That's what you say.

1662
02:06:52,129 --> 02:06:52,573
Hmm..
