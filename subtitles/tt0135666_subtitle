1
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,440
I must admire your courage.

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,837
I have 25 bodyguards with me.

3
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,808
You have come to make a deal
with your enemy, that too alone?!

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,173
Do you have faith
in the divine powers?

5
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:57,142
Only if the divine powers
help in such matters.

6
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,504
You are right, Raja Thakur.

7
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:04,373
If the divine powers
wouldn't have helped,..

8
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,512
...we wouldn't be
dealing in millions.

9
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,804
Meet my divine power.

10
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:40,110
Inspector!

11
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,112
Inspector D'costa.

12
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,747
Don't be afraid.
I am Kale Sarkar (Boss).

13
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:55,405
And he is my boss.

14
00:02:57,167 --> 00:03:00,307
Under his wing,
one does not need any bodyguard.

15
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,236
Neither you, nor I.

16
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,679
By the way,
he will approve this deal.

17
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,713
Give me my share,
and finalize your deals.

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,343
Sure.

19
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,769
Then shall we make a deal?

20
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:46,173
Rs.26,00,000.

21
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:10,108
Attention! Attention!

22
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,178
The police has surrounded you.

23
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,235
Don't move.

24
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:16,902
I repeat!

25
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,638
The police has surrounded you.

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,980
You can't escape.

27
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,906
- Didn't you hear that?
- You are saying this?

28
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,647
You will betray me?

29
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:38,239
I have been filling
your pockets since 7 years.

30
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:42,104
Since 17 years, the police..

31
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,268
Hold your fire.

32
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,938
Hey D'costa!

33
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,078
You have messed with me,..

34
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,971
...now think of the consequences.

35
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,710
I will destroy you.

36
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:05,642
You will spend all
your life in jail.

37
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,544
You are charged of 12 murders.

38
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,905
You will rot in jail.

39
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,503
Arrest these bastards!

40
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,839
This battle will be fought later,
D'costa.

41
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:22,012
Kale Sarkar, that was indeed
a good deal through this rascal!

42
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:28,506
You don't know, I am
responsible for the death of..

43
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:30,979
...several police
officers like you.

44
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,975
Remember, I won't spare you!

45
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,842
See the evidence and taste it.

46
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,979
I have arrested everybody.

47
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,646
The drama is over.

48
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:09,844
That means the game is over.

49
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,840
Pure like a mother's milk.

50
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,911
Like the elixir of life.

51
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,945
Soft and hot like a beloved's kiss.

52
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:34,239
Fragrance like a new note.

53
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,169
That is why after
consuming this,..

54
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:41,840
...one forgets his
mother and beloved both.

55
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,110
You can be a good salesman.

56
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,976
It is not so easy to sell drugs.

57
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:53,946
Who had said that the labourer
should get his wages on time?

58
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:55,773
Lenin had said it.

59
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:59,444
But I'm asking for my share,
and not wages.

60
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:02,906
It was necessary to
punish them because..

61
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,607
...they wanted to become
powerful at my cost.

62
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,778
This belongs to the boss.

63
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:20,774
- Which boss?
- My boss.

64
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,040
D'costa extracts money
from wherever possible.

65
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,438
He negotiated the deal,
took his share.

66
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:35,509
He raided, and earned there too.

67
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:39,514
He squeezed money from me, and
also a reward from the government.

68
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:44,575
It's not my cup of
tea to mess with him.

69
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:50,711
God himself will have
to come down to deal with him.

70
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,712
O dove eyed damsel, who are you

71
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,781
O lass with long tresses,
who are you

72
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,648
O lady with a graceful
gait, who are you

73
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:06,646
O fair lady, who are you

74
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,569
My name is Layla

75
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,510
My name is Layla

76
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:23,037
My name is Layla. Layla. Layla

77
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,038
Love me beloved

78
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,513
My age"

79
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,444
My age"

80
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,777
My age"

81
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,704
...is 16

82
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,505
...is 16

83
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:41,513
My name is Layla

84
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,478
My name is Layla

85
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:46,946
My name is Layla. Layla. Layla

86
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:51,245
Love me beloved

87
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,507
My age..My age..

88
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:58,741
My age"

89
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,512
...is 16

90
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,370
...is 16

91
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:05,372
My name is Layla

92
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:07,513
My name is Layla

93
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:11,640
My name is Layla. Layla. Layla

94
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:58,774
Who is that lovely
face in your locket

95
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:06,508
Tell me do you love anyone else

96
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,709
Or else we can't fall in love

97
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,202
...is 16

98
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,946
...is 16

99
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:20,847
My name is Layla

100
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,777
My name is Layla

101
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:26,779
My name is Layla. Layla. Layla

102
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,780
love me beloved

103
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,704
Good morning darling.

104
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,671
What good morning? It's afternoon.

105
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,376
I have seen many women
for whom one can die.

106
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:24,142
For the first time I've
seen a girl for whom one can kill.

107
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,304
- What do you want?
- Everything.

108
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:45,114
A hug, a kiss, and an ice-cream.

109
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,506
How was it, my darling?

110
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:15,846
A hug, a kiss, or an ice-cream?
What will you have?

111
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,446
Would you like to go
home or to the hospital?

112
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:23,877
I see!

113
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:36,037
Why are you looking like that?

114
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,307
I never imagined this side of you.

115
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:46,107
Even I had never imagined.

116
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,270
You are a calm person.

117
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,943
And today you were so angry..

118
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,703
...as if you would kill them.

119
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,305
I will kill if anyone
casts an evil eye on you.

120
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:01,146
You are not only my love,
but my obsession.

121
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,812
Mother, you?!

122
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:19,938
- Mother, you here?!
- I've come to talk to you.

123
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,973
- Will you have tea?
- I haven't come here to have tea.

124
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,707
Ravi, have your breakfast.

125
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,043
Mother, he is in a hurry.
Ms. Sheena must be waiting.

126
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,138
Ravi will not go anywhere.
I want to talk to both of you.

127
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:40,177
- May I know what's going on?
- What do you mean, mother?

128
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,772
How long will this go on?

129
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,803
She comes here daily,
cooks for you,..

130
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,172
...she cleans your house.

131
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,040
And at night, she serves
you dinner, puts you to bed..

132
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,704
...and returns home
after midnight. Why?

133
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,135
One does this after marriage too.

134
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,313
Then why don't you get married?

135
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:08,045
We will get married.
But I want to earn some money..

136
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:10,635
...and become capable.

137
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,048
- You both will get married
exactly after a week. -What!

138
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,239
I consulted the priest, and
came to inform you, and not to ask.

139
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,904
Your uncle is coming
from Pune after 3 days.

140
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,037
The engagement is on that day.

141
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,977
After four days of engagement,
is your marriage.

142
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:29,170
Get married.
There's enough time to think later.

143
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,043
If you want to live
in the society,..

144
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,111
...we have to obey its laws.

145
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:42,783
How long will the law
blindly watch all this?

146
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:45,739
When I read the newspapers,
its only about..

147
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,141
...thefts,
murders, rapes, kidnappings.

148
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,038
And now this bomb blast.

149
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,644
What does this city lack?

150
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:56,846
India is the best

151
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,644
You are told that no matter
if 10 criminals escape,"

152
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,780
...but an innocent
shouldn't be punished.

153
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:06,640
I say that not one criminal
should be able to escape.

154
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,839
No matter if some innocent
people are arrested.

155
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,638
The court gives the verdict.

156
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,771
Our duty is to nab the criminals,..

157
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,311
...and do the right investigation.

158
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:16,837
In short"

159
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:20,248
Mercy on the criminals
is injustice to the innocent.

160
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,772
One should learn this
from Inspector D'costa.

161
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:27,570
Recently the way he trapped
dangerous criminals like..

162
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,580
...Raja Thakur and Kale
Sarkar in his clutches..

163
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:32,635
...Is a splendid example.

164
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,607
And I am proud of Mr. D'costa.

165
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,104
Emerson had said,
that if one school opens,..

166
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,069
...three jails shut down.

167
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,974
While nabbing the criminals,
we also have to save the innocents.

168
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:51,575
So that the citizen can
lead fearless life because of us.

169
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,581
Wait, children.
It is not an favourable moment.

170
00:21:56,633 --> 00:22:00,206
Just a few moments to go.

171
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,179
Now with hopes and
faith in your mind,..

172
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,809
...when stars are favourable,
two hearts unite.

173
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,707
Now go ahead.

174
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,738
Now all the stars are favourable.

175
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,275
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

176
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,945
Give me too some flower?

177
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,807
Get the sweets.

178
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,240
Feeling strange, isn't it?

179
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,670
I feel as if l have
come to a circus.

180
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:35,904
We have to seek blessings
of the Ring Leader.

181
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,540
- Let's go.
- It reminds me of my days.

182
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,537
Bless you.

183
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,214
I didn't expect this from you,
Ravi. You broke my heart.

184
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:54,978
What? I didn't understand.

185
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,579
Even I was in the queue.
Today I am left all alone.

186
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:06,609
You should have told me earlier.
Now I am engaged to him.

187
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,910
And as it is he
likes matured women.

188
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,537
Oh! I didn't know that.

189
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,469
Then I'll adopt him.

190
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,506
My only blessings is..

191
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:21,077
...May no calamity befall you.

192
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,171
Take this.

193
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,104
- What is this?
- A present.

194
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:30,971
With this money, buy a
wedding attire of your choice,..

195
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,639
...bangles and anklets.

196
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,205
All this jewelry are like shackles.

197
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,177
You will wear them,
and it will bind him.

198
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:45,047
- How?
- I mean..

199
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:50,106
...like the police is with
the criminal when he handcuffs him.

200
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,241
- When are they getting married?
- On 14 November.

201
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:57,878
Exactly after 4 days.

202
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:00,906
And the marriage will
take place at my house in Pune.

203
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:02,377
Sheena"

204
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:03,975
it is your responsibility.

205
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:06,806
You will come with Ravi's
wedding procession to my house..

206
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:08,574
...on the 14th November.

207
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,445
Make sure he does not escape.

208
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:12,772
What if I elope with him?

209
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,406
- Where are you going?
- To buy a wedding string.

210
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:20,839
Okay, go ahead.

211
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,976
You reside in my eyes

212
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:13,873
You reside in my eyes

213
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:16,311
I'll keep you in my heart

214
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:18,574
You reside in my eyes

215
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,806
I'll keep you in my heart

216
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:25,680
I can see you whenever I wish,
I will make you mine

217
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,843
You reside in my eyes

218
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,504
You reside in my eyes

219
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,711
I'll keep you in my heart

220
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:53,013
You reside in my eyes

221
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,480
I'll keep you in my heart

222
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,510
I can see you whenever I wish,
I will make you mine

223
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:02,274
You reside in my eyes

224
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,543
I'll keep you in my heart

225
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,442
Now you are my fate

226
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:37,941
Now you have taken over my heart

227
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:46,573
Your lips create
a sensation in my heart

228
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,840
Your eyes rob my peace

229
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,279
I just stole your peace

230
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:02,508
I just stole your peace

231
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,805
I will steal you one day

232
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,243
I just stole your peace

233
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,509
I will steal you one day

234
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:14,575
I can see you whenever I wish,
I will make you mine

235
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,912
When you are with me,
nothing else matters

236
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:06,344
These sparkling eyes,
the stars don't matter

237
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:14,711
May you be in my breath
and in my heartbeat

238
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:20,116
May we never separate
even for a moment

239
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,579
If I'm asked what is love..

240
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:30,907
If I'm asked what is love..

241
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:33,470
I'll say it's you

242
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,112
If I'm asked what is love..

243
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,147
I'll say it's you

244
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,780
I can see you whenever I wish,
I will make you mine

245
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,278
You reside in my eyes

246
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,814
You reside in my eyes

247
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:08,304
I'll keep you in my heart

248
00:29:08,534 --> 00:29:10,571
You reside in my eyes

249
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,802
I'll keep you in my heart

250
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:18,239
I can see you whenever I wish,
I will make you mine

251
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:45,513
If we don't leave within 7 minutes,
you can't leave today.

252
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,080
We'll have to leave tomorrow.
The time won't be favourable.

253
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,644
- Uncle, tell me one thing.
- Yes.

254
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,809
If I get late tomorrow
by any reason.

255
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,673
Then will you
postpone the marriage?

256
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:02,610
I will cancel the marriage.
But I know this won't happen.

257
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:06,341
Sheena,
will this man reach on time?

258
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,744
He will reach before time.
I hope you trust me, uncle.

259
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:11,070
Only five minutes to go.

260
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,040
- Ravi, did you keep all things?
- Yes, mother.

261
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,239
Give me the wedding string.
What if you forget?

262
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:20,381
You are taking away everything.
You taking Mohini too.

263
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:22,170
Leave something for me.

264
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,411
It's a matter of two days.
Take care, dear.

265
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:32,273
Ravi, are you afraid of marriage?

266
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:35,844
When you are with me,
I am not afraid of anything.

267
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,236
I am only afraid..

268
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,612
...that I might lose you.

269
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:43,444
That is not possible.

270
00:30:57,133 --> 00:31:01,343
You never asked me that question..

271
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,240
...which every woman
asks her man some day.

272
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,010
Because I am not an ordinary woman.

273
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,410
And you..

274
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,175
I know you more than I know myself.

275
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:19,071
I will never question you.

276
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,774
But even I should
never be questioned.

277
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:33,209
When you won't question me,
how can I question you?

278
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,444
Sikandar Bakht speaking.
ls D'costa there?

279
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:42,611
I'll check.

280
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,342
Yes?

281
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,280
I've heard that some amateurs
have come from Banaras.

282
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:54,410
They want to sell a
small consignment of drugs.

283
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:57,708
Today they will make
a deal at Madh Island.

284
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:01,004
I want you to raid and kill them.

285
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:05,971
I want to declare my
monopoly in this business.

286
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,011
- My reward?

287
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:12,443
The goods seized will be all yours.

288
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:15,242
I will give you Rs. 2,00,000 more.

289
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:21,342
- When and where?
-130, Silver Beach.

290
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,538
Bungalow no. 123.

291
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:53,571
Search the house.

292
00:34:57,967 --> 00:34:58,877
Boss..

293
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:01,111
There's nothing here.

294
00:35:11,134 --> 00:35:12,078
That's smart!

295
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:16,411
But what about him?

296
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,374
What?!

297
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,073
Hello! Hello!
Madam I want to speak to Pune.

298
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,279
- Sheena, where is Ravi?
- Mohini, listen.

299
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:57,904
I want to meet Ravi.

300
00:37:57,967 --> 00:37:59,844
Nobody will be
allowed to go inside.

301
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,881
- I want to meet Ravi.
- You can't meet him.

302
00:38:02,934 --> 00:38:04,641
- Please allow us.
- But why not.

303
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:09,812
Doctor, my would be husband
is struggling for life.

304
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:11,980
And they are not
letting me meet him.

305
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,240
If you want him to live,
please don't make a noise.

306
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,781
He has survived of four
bullets and four operations.

307
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:21,747
So at least you don't
put in the jaws of death.

308
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,302
Wait till 24 hours.

309
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:29,079
I know that he will survive
till his fist is closed.

310
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:33,141
I want to meet him.
I want to see him.

311
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,571
He is unconscious.
How will you meet him?

312
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:36,973
- Please make her understand.
- Mohini!

313
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:40,243
And as it is you can't meet
him without police permission.

314
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,738
Please take her away.

315
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:44,269
What is happening?

316
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,575
- Come, Mohini.
- But Ravi..

317
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:54,808
Inspector D'costa, we have
to pull out the criminals..

318
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:58,546
...hiding in the posh
buildings and obscure paths.

319
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,677
Just like surgeons cut those
parts of body which has got cancer.

320
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,202
I understand sir.

321
00:39:05,434 --> 00:39:07,607
And that is why I am worried.

322
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:10,174
Meaning?

323
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,509
Sir, it is easy to pull
out professional criminals..

324
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:15,171
...from buildings
and obscure paths.

325
00:39:15,234 --> 00:39:17,680
But we can't barge into
the houses of common citizens.

326
00:39:18,534 --> 00:39:19,911
Now for example, this case.

327
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,705
An ordinary young photographer,"

328
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,678
...and 3 kilo's. of heroin
was seized from his house.

329
00:39:25,134 --> 00:39:26,613
Good worth Rs. 15,00,000.

330
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:30,139
The new generation
is addicted to drugs.

331
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:33,876
So even the dealers would
be from the new generations.

332
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,073
Through them, we can get
to the roots of this crime.

333
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:38,605
I doubt it sir.

334
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:41,141
The rewards for not
speaking up is much more..

335
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:43,111
...than the fear of our torture.

336
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:45,171
He will not speak up.

337
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:52,511
When I investigate,
I can compel anyone to speak up.

338
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:56,880
You are an expert
in nabbing criminals.

339
00:39:57,867 --> 00:40:00,711
But making one reveal
the truth is an alt in itself.

340
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:02,946
- You leave this case to me.
- Sir.

341
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,239
I will see to it that Ravi
Malhotra reveals the truth.

342
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:08,678
But he must survive at any cost.

343
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,714
Although, he might prefer
to die after meeting me.

344
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:26,771
- Sir, I want to meet Ravi.
- Nobody can meet him.

345
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,642
I am not a stranger.
My name is Mohini. I am his..

346
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,771
Whoever you may be,
the police is investigating.

347
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,973
During this,
nobody will be allowed to meet him.

348
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:35,636
But why not?

349
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:38,071
Now will the police
keep a watch on us?

350
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,640
Will a mother or a sister
have to seek police permission..

351
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,509
...to meet her son or brother?

352
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:47,880
And if it is so,
tell me can I meet my Ravi?

353
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:51,040
- Just a minute. Who are you?
- She is my niece Mohini.

354
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:53,774
She is Ravi's fiancee.

355
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:56,171
The police is not
letting her meet Ravi.

356
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,543
Has the police
taken over this city?

357
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:02,140
Then do you want the
criminals to take over?

358
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,540
Did the police stop other
people from meeting other patients?

359
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:08,105
Your Ravi is a criminal.

360
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,777
And the police has the
right to interrogate a criminal.

361
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,080
You want to interrogate
about a case, right?

362
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,040
But I want to inquire
about my entire life.

363
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,446
Sir, I beg of you.
Please allow her to meet Ravi.

364
00:41:21,734 --> 00:41:23,839
He took her name when
he gained consciousness.

365
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:30,480
Believe me, I am as happy
as you are about his survival.

366
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,938
You want to meet him?

367
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,011
- Yes sir.
- Come with me.

368
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:46,113
Ravi, it's me.

369
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:50,148
Open your eyes, Ravi.

370
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:53,572
It's me. Mohini.

371
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,876
Ravi, you are alive?

372
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,574
I can't believe this.

373
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,738
My Ravi is alive.

374
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:18,071
Who is he?

375
00:42:20,034 --> 00:42:21,308
That's not important.

376
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:25,813
But you tell me how did
you get involved in this?

377
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,504
What happened, Ravi?

378
00:42:30,734 --> 00:42:31,940
I don't know.

379
00:42:34,534 --> 00:42:42,077
All I remember is that
an inspector shot me.

380
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:54,312
And I don't know what happened.

381
00:42:54,734 --> 00:42:56,736
You don't know, is it?

382
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,410
Give this excuse
to someone else, not me.

383
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,573
You can cheat her. Infact you are.

384
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:05,878
But you can't escape from me.

385
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,773
You are in the clutches of law.

386
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,402
Heroin worth Rs. 15,00,000
was seized from your house,..

387
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,775
...and you say you don't know?

388
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:18,474
When the police
raided your house,..

389
00:43:18,534 --> 00:43:20,639
...you had a gun in hand,
and you say you don't know?

390
00:43:24,867 --> 00:43:27,245
Had Inspector D'costa
not fired first,..

391
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,473
...perhaps he would've
been lying here in your place.

392
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,471
But Inspector D'costa
never makes a mistake.

393
00:43:37,934 --> 00:43:44,317
Your Inspector D'costa has
committed his first mistake.

394
00:43:47,434 --> 00:43:48,504
I don't know.

395
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:51,341
I don't know, indeed!

396
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:53,246
Whom do you work for?

397
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,943
Who gave you the drugs..

398
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,809
...to distribute to
the children of this city?

399
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,676
- Ravi!
- I want to know his name.

400
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:05,172
This is not a police station.
You cannot yell at my patient.

401
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:13,816
Even you don't trust me?

402
00:44:14,734 --> 00:44:16,771
I trust no one, but you.

403
00:44:16,967 --> 00:44:18,275
I trust only you.

404
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:29,912
I was right.

405
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:34,905
I had said that till his
fist is closed, he will survive.

406
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:51,380
This is a wedding string.
Do you still believe that..

407
00:44:51,434 --> 00:44:55,246
Ravi, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

408
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,443
You are bent of ruining
the lives of those who love you.

409
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,237
Because of this girl,
I give you one chance..

410
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,672
...to become a police informer.

411
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,380
Perhaps because this
is your first crime.

412
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,404
Who is your leader?

413
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:16,145
I don't know.

414
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:19,706
Sir, please go from here.

415
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,575
Once he survives,
you may send him to the gallows.

416
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,438
Don't forget.

417
00:45:28,134 --> 00:45:29,704
The court awaits you.

418
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,202
Heroin worth Rs. 15,00,000
was seized from your house,..

419
00:45:43,267 --> 00:45:44,644
...and you say you don't know?

420
00:45:45,434 --> 00:45:47,175
When the police
raided your house,..

421
00:45:47,234 --> 00:45:49,339
...you had a gun in hand,
and you say you don't know?

422
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,843
Whom do you work for?

423
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,440
Who gave you the drugs..

424
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,502
...to distribute to
the children of this city?

425
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:57,103
I want to know his name.

426
00:45:58,434 --> 00:46:00,505
D'costa,
you are required in the city,"

427
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:02,205
...l will handle the legal matters.

428
00:46:02,267 --> 00:46:03,712
As it is this is
an open and shut case.

429
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:05,713
It's my job to
nab the criminals,..

430
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:07,212
...and your job
to make them speak up.

431
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:09,847
- We make a great team.
Carry on. -Sir.

432
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:14,611
Excuse me.

433
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,742
- You?!
- Concerning Ravi's..

434
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,145
I can sympathize with you.
But I can't help you.

435
00:46:26,634 --> 00:46:30,241
If any injustice is done to you,
you may go the court.

436
00:46:30,767 --> 00:46:32,440
Injustice is done to whom?

437
00:46:33,467 --> 00:46:35,538
Who is the victim of injustice?

438
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,511
What is my fault?

439
00:46:39,034 --> 00:46:40,377
You are not at fault.

440
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,207
That is why I sympathize with you.

441
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:47,645
How do I convince you
that Ravi is innocent like me?

442
00:46:48,334 --> 00:46:50,371
He is a noble person
who respects the law..

443
00:46:50,434 --> 00:46:52,471
He must be a noble man for you,
not for us.

444
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:56,205
I can understand your feelings
but I can't believe it.

445
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:59,580
- And you..
- And you hate him.

446
00:46:59,767 --> 00:47:02,543
The police does not
hate or love anybody.

447
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:04,673
We only do our duty.

448
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:12,518
What if this had
happened to your sister?

449
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,976
I consider you as my sister.

450
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,746
I can only sympathize with you.

451
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,506
I'm sorry, I can't help.

452
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:39,371
On the basis of all the
witnesses and evidence,..

453
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:45,616
...Ravi Malhotra is sentenced
to 4 years imprisonment.

454
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:47,080
Inspite of all that
happened in our lives,..

455
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:48,971
...you still have such dreams.

456
00:48:49,434 --> 00:48:51,414
See the reality, Mohini.

457
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:54,913
Don't dream and face the reality.

458
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,571
After spending 4 years in jail,..

459
00:48:58,634 --> 00:49:01,376
...l myself don't
know what I will be.

460
00:49:02,634 --> 00:49:04,875
Don't feel offended, Mohini.

461
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,506
Our love story ends here.

462
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,474
My name is Kaku. What's yours?

463
00:51:30,867 --> 00:51:31,902
Why are you here?

464
00:51:32,534 --> 00:51:35,447
Now that you have come, let
me tell you that you deserved this.

465
00:51:37,933 --> 00:51:40,539
It is not a serious
crime to commit a murder.

466
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:45,073
It is a crime to get caught
after committing a murder.

467
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,348
Good that even you don't
talk too much like me.

468
00:51:55,867 --> 00:51:58,211
But now that you are
my companion in this cell,..

469
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,447
...let me tell you
something about this place.

470
00:52:02,734 --> 00:52:05,408
This is hell.

471
00:52:06,234 --> 00:52:07,872
Everything happens here.

472
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,110
Murder, theft, drug addiction,
gambling. Everything.

473
00:52:15,234 --> 00:52:17,737
People even try
to boss around here.

474
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,144
Only one thing does
not happen. Rape.

475
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,847
Why? Because there
are no women around.

476
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,846
Or else even that
would have happened.

477
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,177
Now look, I'll tell you.

478
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,971
He is Raja Thakur.

479
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:41,746
The leader of 130 prisoners.

480
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:47,972
And in the opposition is
Kale Sarkar. He's from Patna.

481
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:55,715
To kill anyone is
a child's play for him.

482
00:52:59,767 --> 00:53:01,940
Even he is a leader
of 130 prisoners.

483
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:03,644
Even I belong to his group.

484
00:53:04,234 --> 00:53:05,804
I couldn't help it.

485
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,338
I have to join to save my life.

486
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,979
Even the Judge is coming.

487
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:31,445
- He is a vicious man.
- Vicious?!

488
00:53:31,934 --> 00:53:33,106
Don't you know vicious?

489
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,640
He finished the entire village.

490
00:53:36,934 --> 00:53:39,278
He took 700 lives overnight.

491
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,138
The court declared him insane,
so he wasn't hanged.

492
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:45,144
And he is sentenced
to life imprisonment.

493
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,012
And an imprisonment that
will last more than 100 years.

494
00:53:55,934 --> 00:53:57,345
- No. 210
- Present, sir.

495
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,245
- No. 211.
- Present, sir.

496
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,807
- No. 212.
- Present.

497
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:28,974
Raja Thakur is the boss of all.

498
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,040
It is your duty to respect him.

499
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:34,911
Listen carefully
to what he has to say.

500
00:54:35,367 --> 00:54:38,280
And obey his orders.

501
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,611
It is better for you.

502
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,140
Listen, no. 365.

503
00:54:48,734 --> 00:54:51,044
From today on,
we will rule your life.

504
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:58,045
You will have to
seek my permission"

505
00:54:58,767 --> 00:55:00,940
...for anything you do.

506
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,512
You can only breath
with your own wish.

507
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:09,069
That too only till we wish.

508
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,005
Go!

509
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:16,608
Listen, no. 515.

510
00:55:18,234 --> 00:55:22,239
I won't become a beast
inspite of living amongst beasts.

511
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:30,776
Stubbornness looks
good in children.

512
00:55:31,934 --> 00:55:33,538
Suit women.

513
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,780
But brutal went it comes to Kings.

514
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:41,543
But it does not suit him.

515
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:33,514
I've decided..

516
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:38,045
I can't say that I'm happy.

517
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,974
But In this situation,
it's better to take decision.

518
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:44,941
I'll learn law.

519
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,101
What do you mean?

520
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,706
Why is man so weak in front of law?

521
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:56,868
I want to know this.

522
00:56:58,067 --> 00:57:00,570
Why can't it protect me?

523
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:02,875
I want to know this too.

524
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:09,708
When did the law turn against man?

525
00:57:10,634 --> 00:57:12,079
I want to find out this too.

526
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,080
You want to become a lawyer?
You want to study law?

527
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:19,474
All this is only possible,
when you remain alive.

528
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,171
Take my advice. Join the group.

529
00:57:22,467 --> 00:57:24,674
Or else they won't spare you.

530
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,175
I need books to study law.

531
00:57:32,434 --> 00:57:34,038
I've sent a request
to the Commissioner.

532
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:36,641
Go and inform him that I have come.

533
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:42,473
And tell him that the deal
will take place in private.

534
00:58:32,934 --> 00:58:35,437
There's something for
you in the warden's office.

535
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:47,772
Thank you Commissioner. Thank you.

536
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,012
Yes, the Commissioner
has sent them.

537
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,708
But I have come to give.

538
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:14,339
I wrote several letters.
But you did not reply any of them.

539
00:59:15,467 --> 00:59:18,346
Didn't I have the right
to know about your well being?

540
00:59:19,734 --> 00:59:21,441
Am I not worth it?

541
00:59:22,234 --> 00:59:28,617
What would I write to you?
About how miserable my life is?

542
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:36,904
I was wandering in the dark.

543
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:40,269
Trying to find a path
which would lead to you.

544
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:44,441
And I found the path,
you were there to welcome me.

545
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:50,413
- What happened?
- Nothing.

546
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:55,608
The pain is so sweet.

547
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,278
Would you like to have tea?

548
01:02:22,867 --> 01:02:25,905
As long as you are within
these limits you are safe.

549
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,374
But the moment you step out..

550
01:02:29,233 --> 01:02:32,680
...then you'll certainly be doomed.

551
01:02:36,567 --> 01:02:43,610
Hey you! Do you think
you can scare us like that?

552
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,770
Hey! you stepped out.

553
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,147
As long as you are within
these limits you are safe.

554
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:16,471
Move..let him go.

555
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,439
Now what's their problem?

556
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,970
Their appeal is that
you shouldn't be left alive.

557
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,512
But because you weren't
the first one to strike..

558
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:15,275
...l appeal that
you should be pardoned.

559
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:18,070
But how can we forgive you?

560
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:19,975
You fight like a beast.

561
01:07:20,967 --> 01:07:24,210
That's the problem, circumstances
compel you to become evil.

562
01:07:25,034 --> 01:07:30,541
They don't make you noble.
I don't know if it really happens.

563
01:07:31,067 --> 01:07:34,844
I'm a human being and
I can't allow circumstances..

564
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,504
...to make me evil like you.

565
01:07:40,933 --> 01:07:43,504
Bravo friend!

566
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:47,343
You are a criminal now.

567
01:07:48,534 --> 01:07:53,506
What crime are you accused of?

568
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:54,978
Crime?

569
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:59,074
Perhaps love is a
grave sin in this world of hatred.

570
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:03,710
Her name is Mohini.

571
01:08:05,934 --> 01:08:09,040
Blossoms bloom at her very touch.

572
01:08:10,134 --> 01:08:12,410
And the birds chirp with joy.

573
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,444
D'costa!

574
01:08:35,734 --> 01:08:41,412
He neither
spares criminals like us..

575
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,347
...nor spares innocents like you.

576
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,145
Raja Thakur..you tell him.

577
01:08:56,233 --> 01:09:00,443
Everyone will know for sure
that you are D'costa's victim.

578
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,046
You concentrate on your studies.

579
01:09:09,334 --> 01:09:11,405
If your studies are for D'costa..

580
01:09:12,367 --> 01:09:14,938
...then you need not
be a part of any of our gangs.

581
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,110
You study.

582
01:09:17,734 --> 01:09:20,146
Studies cannot put an end to evil.

583
01:09:21,867 --> 01:09:26,282
But knowledge can. And
study is no less than knowledge.

584
01:09:26,934 --> 01:09:28,413
Is your strength..

585
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,641
If knowledge is your strength..

586
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,876
...bring him here once.

587
01:09:36,067 --> 01:09:37,876
Show your strength.

588
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:43,812
It would be a great favor on us.

589
01:09:48,834 --> 01:09:49,778
Study.

590
01:10:02,867 --> 01:10:06,110
These days nothing
seems to work on me.

591
01:10:11,901 --> 01:10:13,005
Can I use the phone?

592
01:10:41,967 --> 01:10:47,007
I think she needs company.

593
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,180
Why don't you join us?
Or shall we join you?

594
01:10:50,867 --> 01:10:54,076
What's that song?
Let's go for a long drive

595
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:56,111
Shut up.

596
01:11:01,667 --> 01:11:03,203
She's not alone now.

597
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,204
Who are you?

598
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:07,844
Her father?

599
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:12,973
That's an entirely
different thing..

600
01:11:14,834 --> 01:11:18,907
...but what I mean to
other is a different thing.

601
01:11:19,067 --> 01:11:19,977
Got it?

602
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:21,368
Now get 9114719!

603
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:23,375
I'll settle your bill.

604
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:37,846
Excuse me..thanks a lot.

605
01:11:38,301 --> 01:11:41,248
- These loafers..
- They certainly are loafers..

606
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:44,214
...but unless you dress
more modestly..

607
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:46,873
...you'll certainly encounter
more such loafers.

608
01:11:48,267 --> 01:11:52,340
I don't think the person
I was waiting for will come now.

609
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:53,973
I think I should leave.

610
01:11:54,034 --> 01:11:56,571
Do you want me to accompany you?

611
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,508
Please don't take the trouble.
I'll go alone.

612
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:00,637
There's no danger now.

613
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,576
That's what you thought
when you came here.

614
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,508
I know that you
are very happy today.

615
01:13:18,567 --> 01:13:20,808
Ravi has passed with a first class.

616
01:13:21,634 --> 01:13:23,443
All the leading newspapers
will carry articles about him.

617
01:13:23,567 --> 01:13:25,240
The whole of India
will know about him.

618
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:29,180
Ravi didn't waste two and
half years of his life in the jail.

619
01:13:29,767 --> 01:13:32,509
And believe me,
Ravi won't be in the jail for long.

620
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,874
But he has been sentenced
to four years imprisonment.

621
01:13:39,967 --> 01:13:43,608
Even I was responsible for
all your miseries. I am sorry.

622
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,176
But now I'll help you
both in all possible ways.

623
01:13:47,734 --> 01:13:49,736
If Ravi has been indicted
for no fault of his..

624
01:13:50,601 --> 01:13:52,478
...then I'll see to
it that he gets justice..

625
01:13:52,534 --> 01:13:54,207
...and I get rid
of this guilt of mine.

626
01:13:56,867 --> 01:13:57,971
Thank you sir.

627
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,574
Lily had called several times.

628
01:14:04,834 --> 01:14:05,835
Hell with her!

629
01:14:43,634 --> 01:14:45,409
What will happen now?

630
01:14:46,534 --> 01:14:49,037
Nothing, forget about it.

631
01:14:50,567 --> 01:14:52,843
But you should be on your guard.
He may take revenge.

632
01:14:53,134 --> 01:14:54,169
Impossible!

633
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,340
There's still
2 years of his sentence to go.

634
01:14:58,767 --> 01:15:02,476
If he tries to act smart"
I'll ruin him.

635
01:15:15,501 --> 01:15:18,846
My confidence
transcends all failures

636
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,776
My joy transcends all sorrows

637
01:15:24,367 --> 01:15:27,007
Miseries don't intimidate me

638
01:15:27,534 --> 01:15:29,571
For there's a morning
to every night

639
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:35,746
You have a way with words.
Why didn't I meet you before?

640
01:15:36,034 --> 01:15:39,015
Even I think that way at times.

641
01:15:39,867 --> 01:15:41,847
But what if we had met before?

642
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,475
I would have introduced
you to someone.

643
01:15:47,534 --> 01:15:50,447
Why should I meet anyone
when you are with me?

644
01:15:50,901 --> 01:15:54,815
- What? -After tasting nectar,
would anyone drink anything else?

645
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:02,939
Your laughter is
like a sweet melody.

646
01:16:06,234 --> 01:16:10,341
But tell me one thing..
why are you so gloomy always?

647
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,871
You are always on
the verge of crying.

648
01:16:16,334 --> 01:16:18,371
Won't you tell me
the saga of your life?

649
01:16:21,801 --> 01:16:22,802
Story ?

650
01:16:24,034 --> 01:16:24,978
You are right.

651
01:16:26,734 --> 01:16:29,544
At times life becomes a story too.

652
01:16:31,401 --> 01:16:33,972
Like every story,
it has a prelude..

653
01:16:34,534 --> 01:16:37,344
...a narrative and a climax.

654
01:16:39,567 --> 01:16:41,638
But my story has not
yet reached its climax.

655
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:45,348
When it reaches its climax..
I'll surely tell you.

656
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,211
Do you know me?

657
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:25,644
It isn't easy to forget nightmares.

658
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:30,540
I've come here to
give you something.

659
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:33,244
But before that I want
to ask you something.

660
01:17:34,334 --> 01:17:38,908
But don't you dare
to tell a lie to me.

661
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,878
Did you commit
the crime for which..

662
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,474
...you've been accused of?

663
01:17:45,767 --> 01:17:48,976
Sir, I've already
completed half my sentence.

664
01:17:49,701 --> 01:17:52,181
I can spend the rest
of my sentence in peace.

665
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:56,678
I had a reason to lie before..
but not any longer.

666
01:17:57,434 --> 01:18:03,214
Even then I pleaded not guilty..
and even now I say the same.

667
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:10,142
Your release order.

668
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:17,638
The Law Minister wanted
to know what a brilliant..

669
01:18:17,701 --> 01:18:19,305
...student like you
are doing in the jail.

670
01:18:19,434 --> 01:18:21,243
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

671
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:24,271
And now your reward.

672
01:19:07,267 --> 01:19:12,649
Whether asleep or awake

673
01:19:12,767 --> 01:19:17,807
It's only your visage
that comes before me

674
01:19:18,434 --> 01:19:23,782
Whether asleep or awake

675
01:19:24,167 --> 01:19:29,241
It's only your visage
that comes before me

676
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,674
When someone calls out to me

677
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:41,082
It's your name that I hear

678
01:19:46,334 --> 01:19:51,477
Whether asleep or awake

679
01:19:52,034 --> 01:19:57,484
It's only your visage
that comes before me

680
01:19:57,534 --> 01:20:02,813
Whether asleep or awake

681
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:08,445
It's only your visage
that comes before me

682
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:14,049
When someone calls out to me

683
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:20,182
It's your name that I hear

684
01:20:48,101 --> 01:20:53,101
You've added joy
to my life

685
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:04,980
It's only you that..

686
01:21:05,034 --> 01:21:09,449
...l dream of

687
01:21:10,334 --> 01:21:15,283
It's certainly true that..

688
01:21:15,967 --> 01:21:20,973
...I’ve never seen God

689
01:21:21,534 --> 01:21:26,608
But with conviction I can say"

690
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:32,274
...that you are as divine

691
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:38,050
O beloved, your beauty..

692
01:21:38,401 --> 01:21:43,646
...Is so divine

693
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:49,311
When someone calls out to me

694
01:21:49,634 --> 01:21:55,607
It's your name that I hear

695
01:22:23,234 --> 01:22:28,445
Wherever I see..

696
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:34,082
...It's only you

697
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:39,349
I'm not in my senses..

698
01:22:40,034 --> 01:22:44,608
...that's what everyone says

699
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:50,974
I feel your presence..

700
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:56,216
...wherever I go

701
01:22:56,967 --> 01:23:01,916
I think about you".

702
01:23:02,367 --> 01:23:07,248
...every moment.

703
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:13,607
I see your image..

704
01:23:13,834 --> 01:23:19,182
...In my shadow

705
01:23:19,367 --> 01:23:24,476
Whether asleep or awake

706
01:23:24,934 --> 01:23:30,247
It's only your visage
that comes before me

707
01:23:30,367 --> 01:23:35,612
When someone calls out to me

708
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:41,446
It's your name that I hear

709
01:23:41,901 --> 01:23:47,214
Whether asleep or awake

710
01:23:47,301 --> 01:23:52,944
It's only your visage
that comes before me

711
01:24:28,034 --> 01:24:29,945
- Greetings.
- Tell Mohini that I am here.

712
01:24:30,134 --> 01:24:31,204
She's not at home.

713
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:35,872
- What?
- As if you don't know.

714
01:24:36,867 --> 01:24:38,369
You've come here to meet her today.

715
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,178
Then where should I go..
Isn't this her house?

716
01:24:41,334 --> 01:24:45,510
This was her house till
today but not any longer.

717
01:24:46,967 --> 01:24:47,945
What nonsense?

718
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,574
Yes sir, she'll get married
and go to her husband's house.

719
01:24:53,067 --> 01:24:56,310
She's getting married
in the Temple today.

720
01:24:56,801 --> 01:25:01,079
Marriage? Today? When?

721
01:25:01,334 --> 01:25:02,813
At four.

722
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:07,544
It's ten already.
Why didn't you wake me up?

723
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:11,011
How could I break
your sweet dreams?

724
01:29:11,967 --> 01:29:14,243
It's after ages that
you got a good night's sleep.

725
01:29:15,667 --> 01:29:16,577
Yes.

726
01:29:17,567 --> 01:29:20,639
The siren used
to wake me up in the jail.

727
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:25,712
How do I look

728
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,510
Beautiful.

729
01:29:27,867 --> 01:29:29,005
Without even looking at me?

730
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,544
Ravi..

731
01:29:35,534 --> 01:29:38,447
Let's forget the past

732
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,004
Forget the past.

733
01:29:40,967 --> 01:29:42,446
Is that so easy to do that?

734
01:29:42,701 --> 01:29:44,942
Yes, it is, Ravi.

735
01:29:45,434 --> 01:29:51,009
Yes it is easy.
I am living with sorrows..

736
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:54,944
...and you are living with anger.

737
01:29:56,200 --> 01:30:00,046
But there are many
other things in life.

738
01:30:01,567 --> 01:30:04,138
Can't we concentrate
on all those things?

739
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,501
But where?

740
01:30:09,134 --> 01:30:10,204
In Baroda.

741
01:30:10,634 --> 01:30:14,047
- What's there?
- A new beginning to life.

742
01:30:14,734 --> 01:30:18,739
Let's leave this city.
This is your appointment letter.

743
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:22,174
You've been appointed
the legal advisor in..

744
01:30:22,234 --> 01:30:24,874
...Baroda Pharmaceuticals
on Commissioner's Recommendation.

745
01:30:28,467 --> 01:30:31,471
You are not the only one
who was in jail. I was in jail too.

746
01:30:32,801 --> 01:30:34,644
But I've thought about the future.

747
01:30:36,734 --> 01:30:40,113
Will those years of misery
eclipse our lives forever?

748
01:30:42,767 --> 01:30:46,476
Ravi, I know what
you are going through.

749
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:49,513
Give that pain to me.

750
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:53,511
Forget everything, Ravi.
Forgive everyone.

751
01:30:55,434 --> 01:30:58,472
For my sake..
for the sake of our relationship.

752
01:31:05,167 --> 01:31:06,441
I'll open the door.

753
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:46,608
Search this house.

754
01:31:50,367 --> 01:31:53,280
A criminal once
is a criminal always.

755
01:31:53,701 --> 01:31:55,305
He can never change.

756
01:31:55,601 --> 01:31:59,208
Search the house properly.
You'll certainly find something.

757
01:32:01,367 --> 01:32:04,041
You'll just find the truth
& there are reasons for it.

758
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,070
Because there was
nothing but truth here.

759
01:32:09,201 --> 01:32:13,911
The court knows better
and t can happen again.

760
01:32:23,434 --> 01:32:25,471
Mohini, go inside.

761
01:32:27,467 --> 01:32:28,639
I told you to go inside.

762
01:32:29,934 --> 01:32:30,844
Go in.

763
01:32:34,367 --> 01:32:37,974
D'costa, isn't that your name?

764
01:32:39,467 --> 01:32:40,639
Remember one thing.

765
01:32:41,934 --> 01:32:45,381
Things won't be the same this time.

766
01:32:46,234 --> 01:32:47,542
There are reasons for that too.

767
01:32:48,367 --> 01:32:51,905
At that time you had
met a gullible young man.

768
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:56,948
But now you'll confront
a criminal who had been convicted.

769
01:32:57,334 --> 01:33:00,577
And incidentally he is a lawyer too.
Do you read newspapers?

770
01:33:00,901 --> 01:33:03,142
I have seen many such lawyers.

771
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,877
You sick prisoner..

772
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,273
...This file will always remain
a harsh reality of your life.

773
01:33:11,867 --> 01:33:15,178
I will always be around you

774
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:20,371
Only the weak dream of revenge.

775
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:23,044
But you can't even do that.

776
01:33:23,267 --> 01:33:25,508
Because I won't even let you sleep.

777
01:33:25,867 --> 01:33:28,905
- Orders, Sir.
- You can wait outside.

778
01:33:29,934 --> 01:33:32,437
You are so loyal to your senior..

779
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,577
...that you forgot all about law.

780
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,812
Hereafter if you dare to
enter my house without a warrant..

781
01:33:39,534 --> 01:33:41,172
...It will be at
the cost of your job.

782
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,336
And that applies to you too.

783
01:33:51,067 --> 01:33:52,102
Will you have tea?

784
01:34:05,034 --> 01:34:05,944
Let's go.

785
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,337
Tell me..what do you want to say?

786
01:34:18,934 --> 01:34:21,244
You have raped my life.

787
01:34:22,334 --> 01:34:25,713
You have raped my life.

788
01:34:26,267 --> 01:34:30,909
The fall from honors of a man is
more shameful than a woman’s rape.

789
01:34:35,967 --> 01:34:36,877
Have tea.

790
01:34:43,834 --> 01:34:48,283
Get out of my house.
I said get lost.

791
01:34:49,234 --> 01:34:51,475
That day you had committed
a mistake by coming here..

792
01:34:52,401 --> 01:34:54,278
...but today you've
invited your doom.

793
01:34:55,134 --> 01:34:58,843
You'll lose these stars.
This uniform won't be there.

794
01:35:00,067 --> 01:35:02,877
I'll torture you so much..

795
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:08,215
...that you die a miserable death.
Get lost.

796
01:35:08,767 --> 01:35:11,646
Don't compel me to call
your seniors, get lost.

797
01:35:11,934 --> 01:35:14,073
I wished this to happen.

798
01:35:15,301 --> 01:35:18,145
Now I'll rest only when I kill you.

799
01:35:19,367 --> 01:35:21,938
This fight will
be expensive for you.

800
01:36:55,867 --> 01:36:57,869
Sir, I didn't know that
you come here for jogging too.

801
01:36:58,034 --> 01:37:00,036
I don't usually.
I came here to meet you.

802
01:37:00,334 --> 01:37:01,813
What's the need of that Sir?

803
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:04,047
You should have called me,
I would have come to your office.

804
01:37:04,167 --> 01:37:05,942
I had to discuss some
unofficial matters with you.

805
01:37:06,001 --> 01:37:07,776
So I came here to meet you.

806
01:37:08,234 --> 01:37:09,975
I would have come
home but it seems"

807
01:37:10,034 --> 01:37:11,672
...you don't have
a permanent address.

808
01:37:12,234 --> 01:37:13,304
Is that the truth?

809
01:37:14,701 --> 01:37:16,806
It isn't a crime
not to have a house.

810
01:37:16,934 --> 01:37:20,143
There are many who don't
have a house of their own.

811
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:22,077
You aren't married either.

812
01:37:22,734 --> 01:37:24,213
This is your personal matter.

813
01:37:24,767 --> 01:37:26,838
The society is
apprehensive of people..

814
01:37:27,567 --> 01:37:28,637
...who are loners.

815
01:37:28,867 --> 01:37:31,711
The reason for not getting married
and not having a house is the same.

816
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:36,038
Criminals won't be able to take
advantage of me because of my family.

817
01:37:36,567 --> 01:37:37,841
They won't be able to threaten me.

818
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,673
Now I understand the
reason for your ruthlessness.

819
01:37:41,267 --> 01:37:43,543
But you were a bit
too unjust with Ravi.

820
01:37:44,267 --> 01:37:45,211
Who's Ravi?

821
01:37:45,901 --> 01:37:49,542
Ravi Malhotra, whom you
had sentenced for four years.

822
01:37:49,867 --> 01:37:52,711
The person who came out
as a first class law graduate.

823
01:37:55,067 --> 01:37:58,571
Sir, I've heard that
you had played a major role..

824
01:37:59,101 --> 01:38:00,546
...In pardoning his sentence.

825
01:38:01,567 --> 01:38:04,138
Had you met him?
Had you been to his house?

826
01:38:05,501 --> 01:38:08,778
I had been there once
to know his intentions.

827
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:12,136
The cops do keep
in touch with convicts.

828
01:38:12,501 --> 01:38:15,209
You won't meet him again.

829
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:17,807
Neither will you go there again.

830
01:38:21,101 --> 01:38:22,546
Your records are spotless.

831
01:38:22,601 --> 01:38:25,775
I don't want any of my officers
to be accused of anything.

832
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:29,215
Take it as an official order,
leave them alone.

833
01:38:29,767 --> 01:38:33,078
But if Ravi Malhotra's
case is re opened then no one..

834
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,046
...knows who will be
proved guilty this time.

835
01:38:46,234 --> 01:38:49,215
5 shirts..2 tops..

836
01:38:50,667 --> 01:38:51,737
4 towels..

837
01:38:53,034 --> 01:38:54,012
6 napkins..

838
01:39:09,867 --> 01:39:12,905
- You can go.
- She won't go from here.

839
01:39:13,434 --> 01:39:17,610
If she doesn't you'll regret
that she heard everything.

840
01:39:18,034 --> 01:39:19,172
Get out. Just get out.

841
01:39:25,801 --> 01:39:29,476
Had I not been in love with you..

842
01:39:29,701 --> 01:39:31,977
...you would have
been a widow by now.

843
01:39:34,034 --> 01:39:35,843
He has complained about me..

844
01:39:37,434 --> 01:39:38,777
...whatever he means to you.

845
01:39:41,067 --> 01:39:42,171
He is my husband.

846
01:39:43,434 --> 01:39:45,414
And I don't want to
hear anything against him.

847
01:39:47,467 --> 01:39:48,411
Husband!

848
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:52,442
He is good for nothing.

849
01:39:53,367 --> 01:39:57,144
Believe me,
he won't be able to protect you.

850
01:39:58,767 --> 01:40:03,307
- What will you do?
- I can abduct you now.

851
01:40:03,967 --> 01:40:05,105
But I won't do that.

852
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:09,838
I can send him back to jail,
but I won't do that either.

853
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,575
I can even kill him.

854
01:40:12,867 --> 01:40:14,744
But I won't do that either.

855
01:40:15,601 --> 01:40:20,914
Because I want you to
come to me of your own accord.

856
01:40:22,867 --> 01:40:25,438
And do you think that's possible?

857
01:40:26,967 --> 01:40:29,971
A pumpkin ask a knife,
whether I can get cut or not.

858
01:40:31,501 --> 01:40:34,812
I neither am a pumpkin
nor are you a knife.

859
01:40:35,667 --> 01:40:38,079
You are just a human
being like all of us.

860
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:43,507
I just regret that
I got deceived by you.

861
01:40:43,834 --> 01:40:45,370
I used to respect you a lot.

862
01:40:45,434 --> 01:40:46,936
I don't need your respect.

863
01:40:47,734 --> 01:40:49,771
And to be very frank
neither do I want your love.

864
01:40:49,901 --> 01:40:53,940
I am satisfied with the
fact that everyone dreads me.

865
01:40:56,701 --> 01:41:00,979
Even a tree that gives
shade of love grows up in fear.

866
01:41:02,601 --> 01:41:05,673
If you are afraid of me,
you'll love me too.

867
01:41:05,967 --> 01:41:08,004
Only if you love me,
will you be afraid of me.

868
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,707
I'm a very patient man.

869
01:41:14,534 --> 01:41:18,607
That's what all I have
to say to you right now.

870
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,480
If you want his life,
then forget him.

871
01:41:22,567 --> 01:41:24,342
And be mine forever.

872
01:41:27,834 --> 01:41:28,904
That's it.

873
01:41:29,434 --> 01:41:30,970
There is many ways.

874
01:41:40,601 --> 01:41:44,344
Shut up..
If you make noise, I'll kill you.

875
01:41:44,533 --> 01:41:47,309
- Shut up!
- Let them cry.

876
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:52,308
The more they cry, it will
affect the Commissioner more.

877
01:41:52,367 --> 01:41:53,311
Got it!

878
01:42:02,067 --> 01:42:04,570
- Is what I heard the truth?
- Yes.

879
01:42:04,734 --> 01:42:06,771
A group of terrorists have
kidnapped some children.

880
01:42:06,834 --> 01:42:09,280
They've demanded a ransom
of 1 crore & a vehicle to escape.

881
01:42:09,467 --> 01:42:10,810
And will we let them go, Sir?

882
01:42:11,467 --> 01:42:14,744
But what's the assurance
that they won't harm the children?

883
01:42:14,967 --> 01:42:16,446
Do we have any other option?

884
01:42:16,634 --> 01:42:18,671
Please, I don't need your advice.

885
01:42:20,368 --> 01:42:22,609
Shout, you scoundrels!

886
01:42:24,834 --> 01:42:27,576
The vehicle is here and trust me..

887
01:42:27,633 --> 01:42:29,704
...we won't be the
first one to shoot.

888
01:42:30,734 --> 01:42:32,304
But there's a condition.

889
01:42:32,767 --> 01:42:35,373
The children should be safe.

890
01:42:36,501 --> 01:42:40,244
The more we delay,
the weaker they'll become.

891
01:42:40,534 --> 01:42:42,013
Let's have a look at the situation.

892
01:42:42,734 --> 01:42:45,044
Take this mike.

893
01:42:46,301 --> 01:42:49,805
Make an announcement every
minute regarding the status.

894
01:42:52,034 --> 01:42:54,742
Make an announcement every
minute regarding the status.

895
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:59,408
After 3 minutes there should
be a blast in the backyard.

896
01:43:02,467 --> 01:43:04,413
Our prime concern would
be the children's safety.

897
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:59,840
Run children..run!

898
01:45:04,734 --> 01:45:07,237
On the floor Children!

899
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:57,179
Today's headlines..

900
01:46:57,434 --> 01:47:00,745
Twelve children who had
been held hostages by the..

901
01:47:01,134 --> 01:47:04,513
...terrorists were
saved by the police..

902
01:47:05,034 --> 01:47:07,480
...but DCP N. K.
Mishra fell a victim to the firing.

903
01:47:08,201 --> 01:47:11,444
Mr. D'costa comments
on the incident..

904
01:47:13,301 --> 01:47:15,247
...l wish I had fallen
a victim to their bullets.

905
01:47:17,034 --> 01:47:18,206
He was my mentor.

906
01:47:20,301 --> 01:47:24,374
A very honest and
courageous officer.

907
01:47:26,534 --> 01:47:28,036
I wish I had been killed.

908
01:47:46,467 --> 01:47:47,411
Mohini.

909
01:47:50,001 --> 01:47:50,945
Mohini.

910
01:47:52,267 --> 01:47:54,247
Mohini. What happened?

911
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:57,544
Ravi, he killed the Commissioner.

912
01:47:58,601 --> 01:48:00,478
He killed him.

913
01:48:04,534 --> 01:48:08,038
It's my mistake.
I'm responsible for his death.

914
01:48:08,967 --> 01:48:11,880
- It's my mistake.
- How can it be your mistake?

915
01:48:12,534 --> 01:48:14,844
It's not true that he
was killed in the encounter.

916
01:48:15,567 --> 01:48:18,548
D'costa killed him.

917
01:48:21,534 --> 01:48:23,241
I had gone to meet
the Commissioner.

918
01:48:24,167 --> 01:48:27,546
I showed him all the
photographs and I also..

919
01:48:28,467 --> 01:48:30,208
...told him how
he had threatened me.

920
01:48:31,034 --> 01:48:32,035
YOU!

921
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:34,174
Yes.

922
01:48:37,267 --> 01:48:40,111
It's my fault, Ravi.

923
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:43,910
Had I not met him,
he wouldn't have told him anything

924
01:48:44,534 --> 01:48:47,014
Neither would have
all this happened.

925
01:48:51,601 --> 01:48:54,946
Ravi, I had stopped you
from taking your revenge..

926
01:48:55,934 --> 01:48:59,905
...but today I tell you
to kill that evil D'costa.

927
01:49:00,267 --> 01:49:02,406
Put an end to his tyranny.

928
01:49:02,834 --> 01:49:04,575
Punish him for his crimes.

929
01:49:05,767 --> 01:49:08,111
Avenge him for my sake.

930
01:49:13,934 --> 01:49:16,813
Your husband will become
the cause of his death.

931
01:49:18,167 --> 01:49:20,477
He will die, believe me.

932
01:49:22,067 --> 01:49:25,241
He is dead.

933
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:23,873
DCP Mishra's murderer.

934
01:50:23,934 --> 01:50:29,145
- He killed DCP Mishra.
- Yes, he killed DCP Mishra.

935
01:50:30,967 --> 01:50:32,105
- Run.
- Let's go.

936
01:51:00,034 --> 01:51:03,811
D'costa, you killed DCP Mishra.

937
01:51:05,234 --> 01:51:07,874
D'costa, you killed DCP Mishra.

938
01:51:35,001 --> 01:51:39,040
I've put everything
at stake on your insistence.

939
01:51:39,767 --> 01:51:44,739
My reputation, my Paper..
I published everything you said.

940
01:51:45,767 --> 01:51:48,043
But if you don't
prove the truth of it..

941
01:51:48,434 --> 01:51:50,107
...l can even land up in the jail.

942
01:51:50,801 --> 01:51:52,109
Have faith in me, Sheena.

943
01:51:52,767 --> 01:51:54,269
No harm will befall you.

944
01:51:54,767 --> 01:51:58,146
It won't affect your Paper either.
It will only make it famous.

945
01:51:59,134 --> 01:52:00,374
I hope you are right, Ravi.

946
01:52:00,434 --> 01:52:02,141
Believe me. I am right.

947
01:52:07,434 --> 01:52:08,936
Excuse me, sir.
Have you seen this.

948
01:52:09,101 --> 01:52:11,638
Did you see what's
been published about me?

949
01:52:11,701 --> 01:52:15,148
- I myself am shocked.
- Everyone is in a state of shock.

950
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,304
And what about me.

951
01:52:16,867 --> 01:52:19,711
Sir, allow me to arrest
the Editor of this magazine.

952
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:24,014
She should be in our jail
and I'll investigate the case.

953
01:52:24,434 --> 01:52:26,778
And this Newspapers
office should be closed down.

954
01:52:27,267 --> 01:52:28,837
Everything will be over.

955
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:32,407
- Do you know who the editor is?
- No..

956
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,408
...neither do I want to know.

957
01:52:34,768 --> 01:52:35,940
I know her.

958
01:52:37,034 --> 01:52:39,378
Sheena Vasudev is
an acclaimed editor.

959
01:52:39,434 --> 01:52:42,972
What rubbish?
Her only work is to defame others.

960
01:52:43,134 --> 01:52:45,011
She just spreads rumors!

961
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:48,113
I hope you understand.
Without any evidence..

962
01:52:48,167 --> 01:52:49,373
I have got the evidence.

963
01:52:57,334 --> 01:53:00,941
Sir, I'm a lawyer.

964
01:53:01,434 --> 01:53:03,846
- And my name...
- He's a criminal, Sir.

965
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,243
And he was caught
in a drugs scandal.

966
01:53:05,301 --> 01:53:07,781
Don't ask his name..
ask his Number.

967
01:53:07,901 --> 01:53:12,008
Yes, I've existed just as a number.

968
01:53:12,601 --> 01:53:14,842
I can forget all those
atrocities you inflicted on me.

969
01:53:15,667 --> 01:53:17,146
But I can never forget that number.

970
01:53:17,634 --> 01:53:18,374
Sir..

971
01:53:18,867 --> 01:53:21,143
Here are my certificates
and my license.

972
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:24,136
How are you concerned
with this case?

973
01:53:24,334 --> 01:53:26,746
Just like this killer
is concerned with the case.

974
01:53:26,801 --> 01:53:28,303
- Listen you..
- Let me speak to him.

975
01:53:30,234 --> 01:53:32,339
Do you know that this officer
has been the recipient..

976
01:53:32,567 --> 01:53:34,046
...of several awards
for excellence.

977
01:53:34,301 --> 01:53:38,181
But not this time,
I'll see to it that he's punished.

978
01:53:38,234 --> 01:53:44,378
- How will you prove it?
- I have an eye witness.

979
01:53:53,268 --> 01:53:54,178
Witness?

980
01:53:54,234 --> 01:54:00,947
Yes, a witness who would
testify the truth.

981
01:54:04,067 --> 01:54:05,273
This isn't the truth.

982
01:54:05,901 --> 01:54:07,676
Why didn't you bring
your witness along?

983
01:54:07,867 --> 01:54:11,576
When a Police Commissioner
can be killed..

984
01:54:12,167 --> 01:54:14,704
...can a witness be spared.

985
01:54:20,934 --> 01:54:25,212
You could have come to
us before making the news public.

986
01:54:26,001 --> 01:54:28,675
Then the case would
have been closed.

987
01:54:29,234 --> 01:54:30,713
Now there's no chance for that.

988
01:54:31,201 --> 01:54:34,205
- Why have you come here now?
- There are three types of courts.

989
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:38,577
The people's court -where
the case has been presented.

990
01:54:38,867 --> 01:54:41,848
The court of the Police -
where the case is being presented.

991
01:54:42,201 --> 01:54:44,807
And the third is
the Court of Justice.

992
01:54:45,601 --> 01:54:47,137
If I don't take him there..

993
01:54:47,734 --> 01:54:49,680
...perhaps he would take me there.

994
01:54:49,734 --> 01:54:51,645
Not perhaps..
you can be sure of that.

995
01:54:53,167 --> 01:54:55,704
And you'll be taught
a lesson there!

996
01:54:59,167 --> 01:55:00,840
I had no hopes here.

997
01:55:02,134 --> 01:55:03,579
Let's meet there.

998
01:55:04,434 --> 01:55:05,208
Mr. Ravi..

999
01:55:10,167 --> 01:55:11,077
Think..

1000
01:55:11,934 --> 01:55:15,575
Would you blame the entire system..

1001
01:55:16,834 --> 01:55:18,643
"Because of a single
corrupt officer?

1002
01:55:20,534 --> 01:55:22,673
We have our own Action Committee.

1003
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:23,910
Tabun.

1004
01:55:24,501 --> 01:55:28,176
Can you present your
witness in our committee?

1005
01:55:28,767 --> 01:55:29,802
Tomorrow at four.

1006
01:55:30,167 --> 01:55:34,980
Definitely..tomorrow at four.

1007
01:55:48,134 --> 01:55:49,670
I heard that you are in trouble.

1008
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:53,446
I'm your friend, Sikander.

1009
01:55:55,201 --> 01:55:58,705
What's a friend,
if he can't help you in distress?

1010
01:56:01,567 --> 01:56:04,104
I heard that he'll presenting
the witness tomorrow.

1011
01:56:05,134 --> 01:56:07,842
Don't worry.
He won't reach the tribunal.

1012
01:56:08,734 --> 01:56:10,407
Instead he'll reach somewhere else.

1013
01:56:11,934 --> 01:56:15,939
But my dear friend,
just like you need to..

1014
01:56:16,001 --> 01:56:18,504
...be compensated for every
favor in spite of our friendship..

1015
01:56:18,867 --> 01:56:21,939
...even I need
to be compensated for this favor.

1016
01:56:22,601 --> 01:56:23,545
Do you agree?

1017
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:25,410
Yes I do.

1018
02:00:36,301 --> 02:00:38,303
It's shameful indeed!

1019
02:00:39,534 --> 02:00:41,571
If there was weak
person in my place..

1020
02:00:41,634 --> 02:00:43,477
...he would have killed himself.

1021
02:00:45,801 --> 02:00:54,687
An ordinary civilian or rather
a criminal is trying to defame me.

1022
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:56,402
And still we are tolerating him.

1023
02:00:56,467 --> 02:00:59,380
He'll accuse me
in my own department.

1024
02:01:00,334 --> 02:01:02,610
Sir, there's no eye witness.

1025
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:05,209
And we'll soon know
what the truth is!

1026
02:01:05,468 --> 02:01:09,211
Inspector D'costa, we know
that this is a false accusation.

1027
02:01:09,567 --> 02:01:11,547
But why are you worried?

1028
02:01:11,900 --> 02:01:14,540
- Let the truth come to the fore.
- What truth, Sir?

1029
02:01:15,534 --> 02:01:16,638
My reality or his?

1030
02:01:17,201 --> 02:01:20,705
A Police Officer's statement
or that of a convict?

1031
02:01:21,201 --> 02:01:22,874
That lawyer!

1032
02:01:24,567 --> 02:01:25,671
Come in, Mr. Ravi.

1033
02:01:34,234 --> 02:01:36,373
Sorry Sir, I got delayed because..

1034
02:01:36,434 --> 02:01:40,177
The eye witness got injured
or did he have an heart attack?

1035
02:01:41,367 --> 02:01:43,313
Where is your eye witness?

1036
02:01:44,367 --> 02:01:45,368
Did you see that?

1037
02:01:46,567 --> 02:01:49,810
Mr. Ravi, this tribunal was..

1038
02:01:50,501 --> 02:01:52,708
...called because you were
to present the Eye witness.

1039
02:01:53,601 --> 02:01:55,808
But that eye witness
is not with you.

1040
02:01:57,134 --> 02:02:02,345
He will be here. Trust me,
you'll certainly meet him.

1041
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:06,340
For the time being I present
his statement in writing.

1042
02:02:07,367 --> 02:02:09,176
On 27th February, that is the day..

1043
02:02:09,634 --> 02:02:13,172
...Commissioner
Mishra was murdered..

1044
02:02:13,234 --> 02:02:16,408
I protest, how can he
claim it to be a murder..

1045
02:02:16,467 --> 02:02:18,504
...before anything has been proved?

1046
02:02:21,401 --> 02:02:24,678
I meant to say that this
document will give an account..

1047
02:02:24,734 --> 02:02:32,312
...of whatever the eye
witness saw on 27th February.

1048
02:02:33,201 --> 02:02:36,478
Now even if my eye witness
wants to change his statement..

1049
02:02:37,267 --> 02:02:39,406
...he won't be able to change it.

1050
02:02:40,267 --> 02:02:41,575
- So?
- So..

1051
02:02:44,067 --> 02:02:47,071
...your statement
will be cross examined..

1052
02:02:47,834 --> 02:02:49,507
...with this statement.

1053
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:54,649
Either he will be proved to be
a liar or you'll be proved guilty.

1054
02:02:56,067 --> 02:02:58,843
Sir, allow me to cross examine.

1055
02:03:01,534 --> 02:03:02,672
You have the permission.

1056
02:03:02,734 --> 02:03:08,616
Inspector D'costa,
on the 27th February at 11 AM..

1057
02:03:09,434 --> 02:03:11,539
...you were informed in
the ruins of Rohila Factory..

1058
02:03:11,734 --> 02:03:14,442
...terrorists had held
12 children hostages.

1059
02:03:19,634 --> 02:03:20,738
What did you do?

1060
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:23,545
What would a Police Officer do?

1061
02:03:23,634 --> 02:03:26,342
I told my driver to
take me to Rohila Factory.

1062
02:03:27,067 --> 02:03:31,982
Okay..did you do
anything after that?

1063
02:03:32,501 --> 02:03:36,506
- What? What would I do?
- According to my eye witness..

1064
02:03:37,201 --> 02:03:40,671
...you checked your revolver.

1065
02:03:42,301 --> 02:03:45,373
What else would a Police
Officer do while on a mission?

1066
02:03:45,434 --> 02:03:48,210
Just give me your answer.

1067
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:51,410
Moreover you had been
asked something.

1068
02:03:52,701 --> 02:03:54,612
Please proceed.

1069
02:03:55,301 --> 02:03:56,211
Sir..

1070
02:03:56,534 --> 02:03:57,478
Jeep run.

1071
02:03:58,367 --> 02:04:00,278
And then you reached Rohila..

1072
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,172
How long did it take
you to reach there?

1073
02:04:02,234 --> 02:04:04,908
Half an hour..
Around 35-45 minutes.

1074
02:04:04,967 --> 02:04:06,913
- What difference does that make?
- It does..

1075
02:04:08,167 --> 02:04:10,010
...the police
had surrounded the factory.

1076
02:04:11,034 --> 02:04:14,015
What time did you reach there?

1077
02:04:15,134 --> 02:04:16,112
I don't know.

1078
02:04:17,167 --> 02:04:18,271
You sure know that.

1079
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,947
Because you checked the
time as soon as you got down.

1080
02:04:24,701 --> 02:04:26,112
11:50

1081
02:04:27,967 --> 02:04:32,507
You can check the time
in the statement. Strange!

1082
02:04:33,967 --> 02:04:36,709
My eye witness seems to
remember every move of yours.

1083
02:04:37,134 --> 02:04:39,944
But you don't seem
to remember anything.

1084
02:04:41,134 --> 02:04:46,106
Think about it.
It won't affect your intellect.

1085
02:04:47,167 --> 02:04:49,477
You saw Deputy
Commissioner Mishra..

1086
02:04:50,201 --> 02:04:51,407
...you moved towards him.

1087
02:04:52,067 --> 02:04:55,947
- Didn't you?
- Yes I did..So what?

1088
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:59,574
What did you do on the way?

1089
02:05:01,334 --> 02:05:03,905
I scratched ears..l yawned..
what difference does that make?

1090
02:05:04,167 --> 02:05:07,205
You checked your
revolver once again.

1091
02:05:08,967 --> 02:05:10,344
Why would I do that again?

1092
02:05:11,234 --> 02:05:14,579
Now I remember, I removed my specs.

1093
02:05:15,034 --> 02:05:17,640
You can check in the statement..
that's written in it too.

1094
02:05:18,468 --> 02:05:20,470
That he removed his specs.

1095
02:05:23,501 --> 02:05:25,037
Then you met the Commissioner.

1096
02:05:26,001 --> 02:05:29,107
The terrorist demanded a
ransom of One Crore..

1097
02:05:29,501 --> 02:05:31,037
...and a vehicle to escape.

1098
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:35,542
The vehicle was ready
and so was the ransom money.

1099
02:05:36,234 --> 02:05:39,909
The Commissioner said that
their demands would be fulfilled.

1100
02:05:40,834 --> 02:05:44,179
But what's the guarantee
that they won't harm the children?

1101
02:05:45,567 --> 02:05:48,377
Nonsense!

1102
02:05:48,434 --> 02:05:50,380
- Not the Commissioner.
- You can check it.

1103
02:05:51,167 --> 02:05:54,910
That's what is written
in the statement.

1104
02:06:00,034 --> 02:06:01,342
You planned an attack.

1105
02:06:02,234 --> 02:06:06,842
A hand grenade was used
to throw the terrorists off guard.

1106
02:06:07,367 --> 02:06:10,211
And simultaneously
you took the back gate..

1107
02:06:11,267 --> 02:06:13,804
...and the Commissioner
entered from the Main gate.

1108
02:06:14,234 --> 02:06:15,406
I took the main gate.

1109
02:06:15,501 --> 02:06:17,344
Sorry..l forgot.

1110
02:06:17,867 --> 02:06:19,778
But that's what is
written in the statement.

1111
02:06:19,934 --> 02:06:23,313
You took the main gate
and you saw that two of the..

1112
02:06:23,434 --> 02:06:26,142
...terrorists went
in different directions.

1113
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:29,838
You are not afraid of death..
so you attacked them..

1114
02:06:30,034 --> 02:06:32,014
...and killed one of them.

1115
02:06:32,334 --> 02:06:35,144
And the very next moment
you asked the children to escape.

1116
02:06:36,901 --> 02:06:38,039
Was that a crime too?

1117
02:06:38,567 --> 02:06:40,774
That I saved the children?

1118
02:06:42,034 --> 02:06:45,538
Had you not done that,
even they would have..

1119
02:06:45,968 --> 02:06:47,242
...become eye witnesses too.

1120
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:49,302
Inspector sit down.

1121
02:06:52,267 --> 02:06:54,269
Now just three of them were left.

1122
02:06:54,934 --> 02:06:59,781
Another of them was killed.

1123
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:01,979
It's not that easy to get medals.

1124
02:07:02,734 --> 02:07:08,082
Deputy Commissioner Mishra
trapped yet another one.

1125
02:07:08,467 --> 02:07:10,344
He followed the terrorist.

1126
02:07:12,034 --> 02:07:16,176
The moment he took an aim
at you Commissioner shot him..

1127
02:07:16,934 --> 02:07:18,413
...and the terrorist was no more.

1128
02:07:19,234 --> 02:07:20,144
Right?

1129
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:24,507
Now just one was left. And you two.

1130
02:07:25,001 --> 02:07:26,776
That means the ball
was in your court.

1131
02:07:27,267 --> 02:07:30,180
That means he had to
make an escape not you.

1132
02:07:30,768 --> 02:07:34,477
He tried to hide but
D'costa followed him.

1133
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:38,343
A single step and there
would have been an encounter..

1134
02:07:39,467 --> 02:07:41,071
...but he didn't do that.

1135
02:07:41,401 --> 02:07:44,314
He retraced his steps.

1136
02:07:45,134 --> 02:07:48,274
The terrorist took an aim at him.

1137
02:07:48,867 --> 02:07:50,312
But before he could do anything..

1138
02:07:50,734 --> 02:07:52,338
...Commissioner came to his rescue.

1139
02:07:52,700 --> 02:07:55,840
The terrorist succumbed
to the bullets. D'costa ran..

1140
02:07:55,901 --> 02:07:58,006
...towards him and aimed
his revolver towards him.

1141
02:07:59,967 --> 02:08:03,244
You may be shocked..
but he was my eye witness.

1142
02:08:03,734 --> 02:08:05,441
- But he is not alive now.
- What nonsense.

1143
02:08:06,634 --> 02:08:12,107
He claims that a dead
man is his eye witness.

1144
02:08:13,634 --> 02:08:15,443
I've never witnessed
a ridiculous thing before.

1145
02:08:15,667 --> 02:08:17,738
D'costa handcuffed him.

1146
02:08:17,934 --> 02:08:19,777
Commissioner was
moving towards them..

1147
02:08:20,134 --> 02:08:22,944
...but D'costa aimed
his revolver at him.

1148
02:08:23,767 --> 02:08:25,838
And he shot the
commissioner with it.

1149
02:08:26,067 --> 02:08:28,172
It wasn't my revolver..
It belonged to that terrorist.

1150
02:08:36,967 --> 02:08:40,278
Yes..he is right!

1151
02:08:40,701 --> 02:08:43,307
The revolver belonged
to that terrorist.

1152
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:45,106
That's written in
the statement, Sir.

1153
02:08:45,167 --> 02:08:48,011
I am the witness
you are in search of.

1154
02:08:48,234 --> 02:08:50,145
I saw everything with my own eyes.

1155
02:08:50,634 --> 02:08:51,704
You rouge!

1156
02:09:07,267 --> 02:09:10,578
Inspector D'costa will
be suspended from service..

1157
02:09:10,934 --> 02:09:14,006
...till the court
gives its verdict.

1158
02:09:14,367 --> 02:09:19,009
He'll also be warned that
he shouldn't try to harm..

1159
02:09:19,234 --> 02:09:24,308
...Mr. Ravi and his family members.

1160
02:09:24,867 --> 02:09:28,838
And this Tribunal sentences him..

1161
02:09:29,601 --> 02:09:32,047
...to one year's
rigorous imprisonment.

1162
02:09:35,601 --> 02:09:41,244
Do you think this
will do him any harm?

1163
02:09:44,867 --> 02:09:46,847
D'costa's assets are his strength..

1164
02:09:47,967 --> 02:09:49,275
...and his confidence..

1165
02:09:50,134 --> 02:09:51,340
...his mental conflict..

1166
02:09:51,901 --> 02:09:53,574
...and not his uniform or his job.

1167
02:09:55,034 --> 02:09:58,811
On the contrary he'll
be more dangerous now.

1168
02:10:00,567 --> 02:10:03,912
We just want the
matter to end here.

1169
02:10:04,601 --> 02:10:06,308
Can you be of any help to us?

1170
02:10:06,667 --> 02:10:10,137
No..neither at that time nor now.

1171
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:11,970
What do you mean?

1172
02:10:13,067 --> 02:10:14,944
I'm not concerned
with him any longer.

1173
02:10:15,701 --> 02:10:17,237
But even when I
had been with him..

1174
02:10:17,801 --> 02:10:19,644
...l wouldn't have
been of any help to you.

1175
02:10:22,534 --> 02:10:24,514
D'costa never listens to anyone.

1176
02:10:25,268 --> 02:10:27,009
He lives life on his own terms.

1177
02:10:28,767 --> 02:10:30,144
To be very frank..

1178
02:10:30,734 --> 02:10:33,578
...both of you are nothing
as compared to him.

1179
02:10:36,534 --> 02:10:37,911
You can cause him no harm.

1180
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:44,902
If anyone is capable
of doing that..

1181
02:10:45,867 --> 02:10:47,244
...It is D'costa himself.

1182
02:10:48,667 --> 02:10:49,611
And his vices.

1183
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:54,915
His greed and his evil deeds.

1184
02:11:09,567 --> 02:11:12,605
Let's hurry Ravi.
I've kept the pickles too.

1185
02:11:13,001 --> 02:11:14,503
Your favorite pickle.

1186
02:11:14,834 --> 02:11:17,280
You'll remember me
whenever you eat it.

1187
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:19,707
Nothing can compare your charm.

1188
02:11:20,234 --> 02:11:23,010
Moreover I will
always remember you.

1189
02:11:23,634 --> 02:11:26,274
And the person who
forgets he only remembers.

1190
02:11:27,867 --> 02:11:30,507
That's enough..
don't flatter me now.

1191
02:11:31,801 --> 02:11:34,543
Now you can go to Baroda..

1192
02:11:34,934 --> 02:11:36,140
...and then call me there.

1193
02:11:38,834 --> 02:11:40,814
You spent two and
half years in the jail.

1194
02:11:40,967 --> 02:11:45,848
Five years..two and a
half yours and the other mine.

1195
02:11:46,134 --> 02:11:49,513
Now just 24 hrs are left.

1196
02:11:51,567 --> 02:11:54,309
You are right.

1197
02:12:36,067 --> 02:12:39,048
Ravi Malhotra has left.

1198
02:12:40,134 --> 02:12:42,239
She is all alone.

1199
02:13:39,867 --> 02:13:41,972
Love is pain.

1200
02:13:44,567 --> 02:13:47,776
We feel pain in love.

1201
02:13:50,834 --> 02:13:52,871
Love is madness.

1202
02:13:55,467 --> 02:13:58,380
We lose life in love.

1203
02:14:01,667 --> 02:14:06,776
Love is anguish.
Heart cries in love.

1204
02:14:08,334 --> 02:14:15,650
Love is ecstasy.
Everything happens in love.

1205
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:24,072
Love is pain.
We feel pain in love.

1206
02:14:27,901 --> 02:14:33,044
Love is madness.
We lose life is love.

1207
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:39,813
Love is anguish.
Heart cries in love.

1208
02:14:40,934 --> 02:14:46,043
Love is ecstasy.
Everything happens in love.

1209
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:48,808
All is fair in love and war.

1210
02:14:54,634 --> 02:14:58,514
A romantic night..
passionate night!

1211
02:14:58,967 --> 02:15:02,847
We both are in love

1212
02:15:02,901 --> 02:15:05,040
We are all alone

1213
02:15:07,867 --> 02:15:09,744
Passions are rising

1214
02:15:09,801 --> 02:15:11,838
I yearn for you

1215
02:15:12,368 --> 02:15:16,680
Come to me, my love
Why this distance?

1216
02:15:18,634 --> 02:15:22,605
I love you so much.

1217
02:15:22,867 --> 02:15:26,610
I want to kill you.

1218
02:15:27,534 --> 02:15:30,481
Be patient and
see what happens next

1219
02:16:04,267 --> 02:16:08,215
I'm charming..I’m enchanting

1220
02:16:08,534 --> 02:16:12,414
I'm gorgeous..I'm young

1221
02:16:12,634 --> 02:16:14,841
What do I say?

1222
02:16:17,734 --> 02:16:19,611
Should I trap you?

1223
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:21,811
Should I kill you?

1224
02:16:22,301 --> 02:16:24,212
Something will certainly happen..

1225
02:16:24,267 --> 02:16:26,713
...Just wait and watch

1226
02:16:28,567 --> 02:16:32,743
I love you so much.

1227
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:36,475
I want to kill you.

1228
02:16:37,567 --> 02:16:40,514
I'm innocent..not ignorant

1229
02:16:42,634 --> 02:16:47,583
Love is pain. We feel pain in love.

1230
02:16:51,301 --> 02:16:56,250
Love is madness.
We lose life is love.

1231
02:16:58,167 --> 02:17:02,809
Love is anguish.
Heart cries in love

1232
02:17:04,234 --> 02:17:09,547
Love is ecstasy.
Everything happens in love.

1233
02:17:09,601 --> 02:17:11,911
All is fair in love and war.

1234
02:22:46,833 --> 02:22:48,176
Kill me.

1235
02:22:49,100 --> 02:22:53,207
- No Ravi..don't do that.
- Kill me!

1236
02:22:55,134 --> 02:22:57,580
No court in this
world can punish you.

1237
02:22:57,634 --> 02:22:59,307
Kill me.

1238
02:23:00,933 --> 02:23:03,812
Don't listen to him..
please don't kill him.

1239
02:23:10,467 --> 02:23:11,810
You will certainly die.

1240
02:23:12,967 --> 02:23:16,176
But not here.

1241
02:24:59,867 --> 02:25:01,642
The end.

1242
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:04,704
The story comes to an end.

1243
02:25:12,333 --> 02:25:14,973
You reside in my eyes

1244
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:23,941
You reside in my eyes
I'll keep you in my heart

1245
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:28,073
You reside in my eyes
I'll keep you in my heart

1246
02:25:28,434 --> 02:25:33,406
I can see you whenever I wish,
I will make you mine...
