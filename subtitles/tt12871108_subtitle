1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,280
'As if we didn't have
enough thieves...

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,800
and junkies in the building already'

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,160
'now even murderers are going
be our neighbours!'

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
'Bloody witch!'

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,080
Who is she? - My maid, I told you.
The one who got out of prison.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,200
Can we trust them?

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,760
With what?

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,480
If you think your husband
is unfaithful...

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,720
and you need proof, then call us.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,760
Pay us according to your means...

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,680
and leave the investigation to us.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,400
With all this,
we will also help those women...

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,080
who are harassed and
abused everyday.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,000
Men will suffer?

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,560
Men will definitely suffer!

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,920
That's enough! Now moving forward...

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,560
50 percent pro bono fun...

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,680
and 50 percent our bread and butter,
cheating husbands.

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,200
You betrayed us.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,640
Because I knew...

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,520
that only you can help us.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,960
If you allow, I can come visit...
- Never!

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,680
For the record, tell us...

24
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,920
why you spent 20 years in prison.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,920
Look madam,
I've explained this so many times.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,360
It's impossible for us to dig
out a 20-year old record.

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,120
"I am a witch."

28
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,840
"My eyes cast black magic."

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,760
"I wander in the darkness of night."

30
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,400
"My aura will instil fear in you."

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,280
"Witch.
- It's my reincarnation."

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,480
"Witch.
- It's the end of your story."

33
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,040
4. HONOUR...

34
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,000
'Turmeric milk.'

35
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,840
'Keeping men potent since
time immemorial.'

36
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Here.

37
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,880
'She was lucky, got adopted within
a year of coming here.'

38
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,120
'Mr and Mrs Karim Ali.'

39
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,160
'They couldn't have children
of their own.'

40
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,880
May I help you with anything?

41
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,040
There are no marks on the sheets.

42
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,520
Good God, where is the blood?!

43
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
How did she tear her hymen
at such a young age?

44
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,480
Bring her here!

45
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Girl!

46
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,680
Batool!

47
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,880
The search for Mehak.

48
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,040
What Batool was feeling...

49
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,760
We had no idea back then.

50
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,480
But it was because of Batool
that all of you got busted.

51
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

52
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,720
Do you remember Shehnaz Khalid?

53
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,840
You know, that investigation...
- Forget about what I know, ma'am.

54
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,800
Tell me about Shehnaz Khalid.

55
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,000
Between my husband and I...

56
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,440
Our...

57
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,800
relations...
physical... I mean, it's there.

58
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,240
It's all there.

59
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,040
But it's... For me...

60
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,320
I mean... Uh...

61
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,960
That thing...
- I understand.

62
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,840
Go on.

63
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,960
Sure.

64
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,600
This is...

65
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,360
His bank statement.

66
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
We have a joint account too.

67
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,160
But this is his personal account.

68
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,600
He withdraws a fixed amount from
this account every weekend.

69
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,280
Sometimes he stays out at night.

70
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,800
He says he's working late from
the staff room. But I...

71
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,680
visited the university on Sunday.

72
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,800
No one was there.

73
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,520
Okay.

74
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,760
I will require a few more details.

75
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,440
Like his profession,
mobile number...

76
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,520
car registration...
- It is...

77
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
I have it all here.

78
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,280
He won't be...

79
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,920
Hurt in any way?

80
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,240
No, that won't happen.

81
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,120
Yes, please. He is mine after all.

82
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,840
We've been married for 20 years.
We've 3 kids.

83
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,280
My sons are in Toronto.
My daughter is in Vancouver.

84
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,560
I tell her to move closer
to her brothers. But...

85
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,160
He only eats home-cooked meals...

86
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
that I cook for him.

87
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,680
After that he might...

88
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,240
Go out, if he has to.

89
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,120
My mother always used to say...

90
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,760
that the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

91
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,720
If you cannot feed him,
you cannot keep him happy.

92
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,280
Ehtesham Khalid.

93
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,920
Age, 50 years.

94
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,400
Three children settled in Canada.

95
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,920
Sociology professor at a university.

96
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,920
Loved by everyone.

97
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,480
But he minds his own business.

98
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,440
He jogs thrice a week.

99
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,560
Other than that,
no other social outings.

100
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,120
Just that he's not home
on some nights.

101
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,760
We've kept an eye on his
house for three days.

102
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,560
He hasn't even stepped out once.

103
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,040
Nothing suspicious on his phone.

104
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,440
No messages.
Social media is also clear.

105
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,280
He likes cats.

106
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,920
A lot! - I've created a profile
and sent him a friend request.

107
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,160
Maybe our respectable professor
is into prostitutes.

108
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,880
Which prostitute earns so little?

109
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,320
Someone may be blackmailing him.
- Don't up your status.

110
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,320
You've been sold for less!
- Birthday girl!

111
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,320
Excuse me. - It's my birthday,
don't stop my inner witch today.

112
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Ow!
- Hotel!

113
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Professor is booking
a room in a hotel!

114
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,240
I think, in this price range, it's
likely a three star hotel.

115
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,800
Again, she speaks from experience!

116
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,440
Perfect! Let's track him.

117
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,280
Once we find out which hotel,
we can get inside easily.

118
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,720
Hello?

119
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,600
Event planner extraordinaire.

120
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,760
Hotels are not a problem.

121
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,240
Everyone knows me. Loves me.
- Loves?!

122
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,640
Here she goes
- How do you manage to do that?

123
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,920
Whatever, bitches.
- Okay, I'm getting late.

124
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,520
I have to go.
- Bye.

125
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,240
Okay, Baby. Happy birthday!
- Bye.

126
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,240
Bye, Baby.
- Bye.

127
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,440
Have fun.

128
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,440
"Say that it's my birthday."

129
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,960
"Say it."

130
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,720
"Say it."
- Look at her!

131
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,040
"Happy birthday to me.
- To you, Baby!"

132
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,360
"Happy birthday to me."
- Come closer, come on!

133
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,480
"Happy birthday to me!"

134
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,280
Nimmo, it's your turn now.

135
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,520
You and a saint!

136
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,800
Like you've never taken anything
in your mouth before!

137
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
Enough.
From now, just call me Naeem.

138
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,320
No one will call me Nimmo anymore.
- Check her out!

139
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,800
Nimmo madam has found
her Prince Charming!

140
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,600
Fallen in love with his client!

141
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,640
Either your face cream is working...

142
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,680
or it might be my profile photo.

143
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,080
I am getting many friend requests.

144
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,040
You've always been handsome.

145
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,840
I've tried a new recipe today.

146
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,960
Get some rest sometimes.

147
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,320
I will, after I die.

148
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,520
What?

149
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,040
Where did this come from?

150
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,880
Aw!
- You've gone too old?

151
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,680
Sorry.
- Caught some disease?

152
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,680
Look.
- Oh, that's a nice photo.

153
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,080
Princess Silky.

154
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Really?

155
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,200
Installing a tracking device in
someone else's car is illegal.

156
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,240
Guilt is a strange thing.

157
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,840
Unfaithful husbands...

158
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,560
often use generosity to cover
up their infidelity.

159
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,480
Car, the house...

160
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,680
It was all in Shehnaz's name.

161
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,320
Why, Lucifer?

162
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
No.

163
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,960
You'll give me an advance notice
before you kill me.

164
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,560
I want to die in Dior.

165
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,040
I was cleaning your room.

166
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,800
It didn't happen.

167
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,960
Better this way.

168
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,840
I was never going to get
the 'best mom' award.

169
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,040
Few days ago, I went to see Mehak...

170
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,800
My daughter...

171
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,760
I went to see my daughter.

172
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,200
I'd to bribe that whore
from the orphanage...

173
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,680
to finally get her address.

174
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,040
She looked happy.

175
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,800
Did you tell her who you are?

176
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,560
No. I didn't meet her.

177
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,000
She has a family now.

178
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,480
I went by her street thrice.

179
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,600
And I hid behind a tree...

180
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,880
So I could watch her.

181
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,000
She loves flowers.

182
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,080
She is very pretty.

183
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,600
Go and meet her.

184
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,040
She is happy without me.

185
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,400
No child is ever happy
without the mother.

186
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,800
Unless and until the mother...

187
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,560
is psycho, savage, or a murderer.

188
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,440
Oh, wait a second.

189
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,800
You are all three.

190
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,040
It was a joke.

191
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,080
It was a bit funny, wasn't it?

192
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,200
Teeny bit.

193
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,280
And if you ever call me psycho,
savage...

194
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,240
or murderer again...

195
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,640
I will kill you without any notice.

196
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,320
Oh fucking psychopath!

197
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,040
Go and sleep. There is a lot
of work to do tomorrow.

198
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,240
Frigid corpse!

199
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,800
Been like this since day one.

200
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,000
My child.

201
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,080
You are the only one I have.

202
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,760
Isn't this so much fun?

203
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,040
Mummy and son bonding time.
- Hmm.

204
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,680
I know I've been busy.

205
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,320
Mom, don't.

206
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,840
I'm not a kid, I know all moms work.

207
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,600
You work too. So just chill.

208
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,920
Cool! We're so old, so big.

209
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,360
Almost like a teenager!
- Mom, enough!

210
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,240
At least tell me what music
you're listening to.

211
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,080
You won't understand.
- Why? Why won't I understand?

212
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,080
Oh, crap!
- Mom?

213
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,840
I'll be back in a second.

214
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,160
Mrs Daruwala.
- Mrs Khan.

215
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,400
I've wanted to apologise for
the longest time, but...

216
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,920
I'm sorry.

217
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,800
It's okay, Mrs Khan.

218
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,320
I understand.

219
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
These days,
parents and kids are both...

220
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
under a lot of pressure.

221
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,720
Whose child is this?!

222
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
Where's his mother!

223
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,480
What's wrong?
- You're his mother?

224
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,000
Tell your mother what you did!

225
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,400
Did he take something Did you
steal something, Salaar?

226
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,400
I'm sorry, what did he...
- He touched me.

227
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,800
What?
- You want me to say it again?

228
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,040
No, I...
- He pinched my behind.

229
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Pinch...

230
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,320
Is this true? You wouldn't do that.
- Why will I lie?

231
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,840
Of course it's true!

232
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Uh...

233
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,320
I don't know what to say.

234
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,960
Well, say that you'll teach
him some manners!

235
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,920
Move.

236
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,440
Which 8 year old boy pinches a grown
woman? - It was big, right?

237
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,760
You thought so too.

238
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,600
What?
- Her bum.

239
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,000
It was huge, right?

240
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,880
Jesus! Salaar, it's never okay
to touch a woman or anyone.

241
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm sorry, it's...

242
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,120
Hey, you can never do that again!

243
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Get it?

244
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,000
Jamil.
- Babe, boys will be boys.

245
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,560
You're excused, young man.

246
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,440
You'll teach them tennis, math...

247
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,520
cleanliness but not basic manners.

248
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,600
Doesn't it bother you that your...
- Come on.

249
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,680
Everyone does this at this age.

250
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,640
I mean, not exactly this, but...

251
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Boys are just curious
about the human body.

252
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,560
I mean, if at his age...

253
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,040
a big bum got into my face...

254
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,600
I'd want to tap it.

255
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,280
Clearly, your DNA is winning here.

256
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Hey!

257
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,960
Extra classes?

258
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,680
Exams are around the corner.

259
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,600
I'll be very late tonight.

260
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,240
You smell nice.

261
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,880
Boss. How do I look?

262
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,440
How do I look, boss? Dinner?

263
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,480
Will you go for coffee with me?
Fucking...

264
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,560
With Dilbar.
Can we go for dinner? For dinner.

265
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,640
You're a fucking asshole,
you stupid motherfucker!

266
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Will you go?

267
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,800
Yes, she will.

268
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,440
He's still at home.

269
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Hi!

270
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,080
Hi.

271
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,000
How do I look, boss?

272
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,000
Smart! Very smart.

273
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,680
Wow!

274
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
Thank you, boss.

275
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,840
Will you've dinner with me tonight?

276
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,560
Or whenever you want to?

277
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Here he comes!

278
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,760
He's getting out.

279
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
Okay, boss.

280
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,920
Ladies!

281
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,600
Yes, there. Day's Inn.

282
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,280
You go in, we're coming.

283
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,120
Can I come?
- I think we got this.

284
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,800
I'm taking Zubaida along.

285
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,560
Muhammad Ali, let's go!

286
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,920
Keep an eye on her.

287
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,840
No beating anyone up.

288
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,200
Come on, move.
Take care of everyone.

289
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,600
I do that any way.

290
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,520
Very cute!

291
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,040
Cute yourself!

292
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,000
Hello.

293
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,840
Have we met before?

294
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,720
Is your mother at home?

295
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,720
Yes. Come on in.

296
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,760
Are you kidding me?

297
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,040
Get to the hotel. I need a nanny for
the baby 'churails' (witches).

298
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
Hello!

299
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,600
Trust me, we've been looking.

300
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,880
Professor made the payment
and went upstairs alone.

301
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,440
No girl came.

302
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,000
Just families and couples.

303
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Hi!

304
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,560
Listen, bit of an odd one.

305
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,880
I want a guest's room number.

306
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,880
It's against the hotel policy.

307
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,320
Yeah, I know but...

308
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,040
I'm Jugnu Chaudhary.

309
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,120
I'm sure you are.
But I can't help you.

310
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,680
You are bribing me?

311
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
Bribe?

312
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,760
What a dirty word, absolutely not!

313
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,600
Because I can report you for
that in 'New Pakistan'.

314
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,000
And anyway, no amount would make
up for the way you insulted me.

315
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,840
Me?
- Yes, you.

316
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,080
I was helping out at
a Glasshouse event.

317
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,320
You passed me by,
waved and said, 'Hello, big whale!'

318
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,920
I would, never ever, ever...

319
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,680
Do such a thing. No.
- Right.

320
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,360
I've heard that you're
an alcoholic...

321
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,760
and you never remember anything.

322
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,640
But you humiliated me.

323
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,440
I cannot help you.

324
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,920
Look I'm...

325
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,560
I'm sorry. Truly.

326
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,600
And for what it's worth,
you've clearly lost a lot of weight.

327
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,240
And if what I said had
any contribution...

328
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,840
Okay.

329
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
No help.

330
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,320
'Going up.'
- Which floor?

331
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,600
First.

332
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
It's cool.

333
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,600
You look fabulous.

334
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,040
You're welcome.

335
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Bitch.

336
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,960
Jugnu, madam!

337
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,040
Ali Raza!

338
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,520
You are here now?
- Yes, madam.

339
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,080
How wonderful!

340
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,760
I'll lose my job.

341
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,040
You won't.

342
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,880
And even if you do, this is more
than six months of your salary.

343
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
Count it.

344
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,760
Thank you.

345
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,080
So you've just moved to this street?

346
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,040
Yes, a few weeks ago.

347
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,520
Your daughter is beautiful.

348
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Isn't she!

349
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,520
And very skilled at domestic work.

350
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,800
She does everything
around the house.

351
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,160
I just want to get her married...
- Mom, what's wrong with you?

352
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,680
I'm only 18 years old.

353
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,000
18 years?

354
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,120
I thought...
- Yes, but...

355
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,000
you know it's so much easier...

356
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,040
to adjust when you marry young.

357
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,040
Is your older daughter
already married?

358
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,040
Older daughter?

359
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,040
Farah's my only child.

360
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,400
She is God's miracle!

361
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,480
We tried everything we could.

362
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,320
But nothing worked.

363
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,480
Then out of the blue, we were
blessed. - So are you saying...

364
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,160
you don't have another child?

365
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,920
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
- But you adopted a child.

366
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,400
Mehak. She must be around 26.

367
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,400
No, 27 now.

368
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,280
Farah, go upstairs.

369
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,400
I said, go upstairs!

370
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,720
Who are you?

371
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,120
Here. Stop. Pause.

372
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,760
Forward a little.

373
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
Enough.

374
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,760
Pause. Can we zoom in?

375
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,800
Is that the fifth floor?

376
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,560
Yes, it is the fifth floor, and...

377
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,720
Hold on,
let me tell you the room number.

378
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,640
It is room number 517, madam.

379
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,280
This isn't allowed.
- What isn't allowed?

380
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,400
Eunuchs are not allowed in.

381
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,640
Nonsense! The registration office
can give me an ID card...

382
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,280
but you can't let me into
this whorehouse of yours?

383
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,800
Move from here, you asshole!
- Wait, eunuch!

384
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,360
Enough now. Leave.
- Get lost.

385
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,440
I hope your balls catch fire!

386
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,000
Fucking bastard!

387
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,600
How dare you come here!

388
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,040
I had to see her.

389
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,320
I thought...
- That Farah is Fauzia?

390
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,240
We changed her name.

391
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,080
Where is she?
I don't have to meet her.

392
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,880
Give me a photo, I'll just look
at that. - She hated you.

393
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,880
She would have nightmares about you.

394
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,520
What happened in front of her...

395
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,480
After that...

396
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,440
Why are you talking like
she's not here anymore?

397
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,000
No one went in that room
apart from him.

398
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,520
Maybe someone came before,
let's rewind.

399
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
See! I told you.

400
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,080
Out, ma'am.
- Actually...

401
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,720
Just a minute.
- Escort her out please.

402
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,320
Touch me. Go on!
- Let's go.

403
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,480
Then see what I do!
- Come on.

404
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,840
Leave. Come on.

405
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,280
You're still a fucking whale!

406
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
Let's go, let's go!

407
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,720
I'm going!
- Come on, leave.

408
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,000
She was like this from the start.

409
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,320
Failed her classes,
disrespected the teachers...

410
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,480
she would come home and insult us.

411
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,400
Boys, alcohol, drugs.

412
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,600
I don't even know where she
got those things from.

413
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,120
What influence would that
have had on our daughter?

414
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,200
She was also your daughter.

415
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,240
You had adopted her.

416
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,920
Made her your own.

417
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,080
In the hope that our love
would shape her right.

418
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,400
But she was your blood after all.

419
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,800
So, what did you do?

420
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,240
We didn't do anything.

421
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,760
She was 15 when she ran away.

422
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,080
Ran away?

423
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,440
Yes.

424
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,520
She was dating this guy.

425
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,280
She wanted to marry him.

426
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,800
Girls say things like
that at that age.

427
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,720
She ran away!

428
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,680
Did you go to the police?

429
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,720
Filed a missing person report?

430
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,040
Did anything?

431
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,720
No.

432
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,920
We finally started living like
a normal, happy family.

433
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,080
Fuck!

434
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,920
Those assholes wouldn't let me in!

435
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,880
They caught me too.
Zubaida is still inside.

436
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Yes.

437
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,480
What's wrong? What's with the face?

438
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,240
I think I saw someone go in.

439
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,560
Someone I know.

440
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
Housekeeping!

441
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,000
No, thank you.

442
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,720
I said, I don't want anything.
Thank you.

443
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
Clean towels, sir!

444
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,720
I don't need them.
- Should I make the bed?

445
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,720
I'm busy and really don't
need anything. Thank you.

446
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,240
Sir...

447
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,840
Hold on. If you...

448
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,440
If you could please fill this form
about your experience, please.

449
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,160
It would really help.

450
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
Please?

451
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,480
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

452
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,800
Thank you so much, sir.

453
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
Thank you.

454
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,000
Come on, Zubaida.

455
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Don't know.

456
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,800
They're in love.

457
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,520
Love? Come on!

458
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,240
This is a straightforward
business transaction.

459
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,040
They are both secretly...

460
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,880
Some of us don't have the luxury
of loving out in the open.

461
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,920
How can we blame those who
are helpless? Please!

462
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,000
The truth will destroy them.

463
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,560
Please understand.

464
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,880
Sara, do we abort?

465
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
Yeah.

466
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
Abort.

467
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,760
We do nothing.

468
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,320
Where have you been?

469
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,040
What are we aborting?

470
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,040
Shehnaz's case.

471
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,440
Ehtesham was at the
hotel with a boy.

472
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,680
It's better to keep that a secret.

473
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,680
So you will lie to Shehnaz?

474
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,040
It's for the best.

475
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
Chocolates won't do today.

476
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,920
Do you have a smoke?

477
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Thanks.

478
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,040
Big mama.

479
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,040
This is for you.

480
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,760
How do you know?

481
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,240
It's my job to keep
an eye on everyone.

482
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,880
'People can justify
almost anything.'

483
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,680
'They can make you believe
that they'd no choice.'

484
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,560
'But the truth is,
we always have a choice.'

485
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,720
Hello.
- Where are you?

486
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,480
I'm returning the key and supplies,
and then leaving.

487
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,040
Don't return the key.

488
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,280
No. We decided...

489
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,920
'Do you trust me?'

490
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,560
Yes, but...
- 'Then do as I say.

491
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,800
Hello.

492
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,000
Shehnaz?

493
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,520
'Churail'?

494
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,760
Give it.

495
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,960
Is she pretty?

496
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,920
You don't have to... do this.

497
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
Hello, Shams.

498
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,960
I'm making a blunder.

499
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,960
'Going down.'

500
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,160
Details, please.

501
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,880
What?

502
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,560
Where were you all day?

503
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,520
Sara!

504
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:26,387
"The heart had found
solace there..."

505
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:33,600
"whether you remember it or not."

506
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:40,600
"Promises were made..."

507
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,560
"whether you remember it or not."

508
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,840
"The heart had found
solace there..."

509
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,960
Wi-Fi. What's the Wi-Fi here?

510
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,840
What's the Wi-Fi password?

511
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,560
I need to video call and
show the children.

512
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,920
What's the time in Canada?

513
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,080
Give me the Wi-Fi password.

514
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,760
What's the Wi-Fi password!

515
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,040
Stop it!
- You shouldn't have done this!

516
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,640
Behind our backs,
she asked Zubaida...

517
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,520
to take Shehnaz to the hotel room!

518
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,480
That poor girl... Why?

519
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,680
Because she respects you?

520
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,600
Let go, Batool! Let go!

521
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,520
They can destroy our lives.

522
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,240
Abuse us, betray us.

523
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,520
Take away every ounce
of our happiness.

524
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,640
And yet you will protect them!

525
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,120
The ones living in big mansions...

526
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,680
throwing money around everywhere...

527
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,760
With all their bullshit
talk about freedom...

528
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,240
What would they know
about suffering?

529
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,040
This wasn't about what happened
to you, Batool.

530
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Get her out of my sight.

531
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,800
Before...

532
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,400
Before this week ends...

533
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
I'll be out of here.

534
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,760
Okay.

535
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,880
What would you do if you
were in my place?

536
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,720
I was.

537
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,080
The place was somewhat similar.

538
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,000
And I did what I had to do.

539
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,000
Any regrets?

540
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,280
No.

541
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,600
I'd do it all over again, if I'd to.

542
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,080
I'll stay tonight with Shams again.

543
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,600
Zubaida.

544
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,600
Just like my parents betrayed me...

545
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,040
so did you.

546
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,040
So how are you any different
from them?

547
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,040
I did what...

548
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,040
Your favourite flowers.

549
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,720
I've never loved another woman
like I've loved you.

550
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,000
But what do I do about
what's inside me?

551
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,040
How do I control it?

552
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,200
This desire to love fully without
fear and inhibition...

553
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,760
My life.

554
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,040
My love.

555
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,600
I want to cook.

556
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,240
I should cook, right?

557
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,880
Right?

558
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,280
You've no idea how difficult it's
to make 'nihari' (meat stew).

559
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,720
Chop it, marinate it.

560
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,080
Cook it on slow heat
for a long time...

561
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Until the meat is tender.

562
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,640
Sara!

563
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,680
Sara!

564
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,880
How are you?

565
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,880
This is my friend.
- Hello.

566
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,400
I am fine.

567
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,720
Sheila speaks very highly of you.

568
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,880
I wanted to come to the store
and meet everyone.

569
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,200
I miss all of you so much.

570
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,920
I'm glad you didn't.

571
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,240
Don't hate me so much.

572
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,600
I don't hate you. I just don't have
the stomach for lies anymore.

573
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,720
You look happy. That's good.

574
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,840
Yes. I'm doing a soap on TV.

575
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,400
Small role,
but the show has great TRPs!

576
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,400
I've also done a biscuit commercial.

577
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,680
And you know...

578
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,320
I've also met someone.

579
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,120
He is sweet. So...
- Bye, Sheila.

580
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,200
Let's go.
- What happened to her?

581
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,080
How often do the likes
of us find love, Baby?

582
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
Forget love.

583
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,680
How often do we find someone...

584
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,560
who doesn't want to tie
us to the bed...

585
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,040
and ask us...

586
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,480
'Slut, are you having fun?'

587
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,920
'Here, take it. Take it harder.'

588
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,760
Someone...

589
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,160
Who just gives us a hand to hold.

590
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,080
And a shoulder to cry on.

591
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,320
Where will I find this again?

592
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,280
'How do we honour those
who betray us?'

593
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,640
'How do we punish our own being?'

594
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,440
'How do we remain human'

595
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,440
'when no humanity remains?'

596
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,720
'Will we ever be anything more than
this world's bleeding wound?'
