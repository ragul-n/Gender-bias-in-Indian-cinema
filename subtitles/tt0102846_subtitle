1
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,813
Please don't kill anyone. Take what
you want, I'd give you willingly.

2
00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:00,757
Any bride who passes this way must
spend her nuptial night with us.

3
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:16,105
- She's going into Sarangfs territory.
- Never mind.

4
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:51,472
I shall not tolerate misbehaviour.

5
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:57,680
Forgive me this once. I shall never
trespass into your territory.

6
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,415
Those that trespass into my territory
walk into the den of the lion.

7
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:08,086
They may come in,
but never return.

8
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:17,097
Stop! Stop right there!

9
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:23,434
If cowards like you who cannot
preserve the honor of your women...

10
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,844
...step on my lands,
this land will turn interfile.

11
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:38,454
Stay over there. I'll get her
married and send her to you.

12
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,442
Had it not been for you, Sir,
I would have lost my honor.

13
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:42,453
I've not been able to express my
gratitude for what you've done.

14
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:50,256
I come here to garland you and
honor you in the presence of everyone.

15
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:53,459
I shall not accept this garland.

16
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,463
- Why?
- This is a garland of mere flowers.

17
00:05:57,304 --> 00:06:03,732
I wouldn't even take a garland
strung with the heads of my enemies.

18
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:08,576
Because the head must be
bowed to accept a garland.

19
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:14,247
I, Chowdhary Sarang, do not like to
bow my head. Be what reason there be.

20
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:26,264
A gift from me, for your feet.

21
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:34,602
I respect feet that can at least
run for the sake of honor.

22
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:38,441
Now you must step on these flowers
before you leave (sign of respect).

23
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:51,786
That was a respectable
sending-off for a bride.

24
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:59,127
As far as glamourous send-offs are
concerned, wait till you've seen...

25
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,393
...Chand gets married. I'll give my
sister the grandest of send-offs.

26
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:54,848
"They'll forget Laila; they'll forget
Majnu," (legendary lovers).

27
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:08,391
"Lovers in future
will swear love by us"

28
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:53,104
"We'll teach the
world all about love"

29
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:08,620
"Our names will be written on
every page of the book of love"

30
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:23,459
"Our deeds will be etched forever
in the minds of people"

31
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:39,145
"Till such time that the moon and
the stars shine and flowers blossom"

32
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:54,657
"In many lives, me shall
meet each other on earth"

33
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:09,765
"The fragrance of love
we shall spread over blossoms"

34
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,432
Please serve lunch, Ganga.
We're very hungry.

35
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:15,497
How much longer will
you keep us hungry?

36
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:18,772
Till such time that
Shiva doesn't arrive.

37
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:21,103
Shiva comes so late these days.

38
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:25,113
We're very hungry.
Please serve lunch, sister-In-law.

39
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,117
- You're very hungry are you?
- Yes, lam.

40
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:29,244
Then, drink water.

41
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,624
Here comes your spoiled child.

42
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:38,120
Will you please serve lunch now?

43
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,127
It's not right of you to starve
all of us for the sake of Shiva.

44
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:49,638
I won't even give food to my own
child before Shiva has eaten.

45
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:54,473
You speak as if your children are
already playing in the backyard.

46
00:13:55,148 --> 00:14:00,348
Only a few months now,
Pinky, before a child arrives.

47
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:05,415
- Really, sister-in-law!
- Is that true, sister-in-law?

48
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:09,421
Won't she feel embarrassed
if you ask such questions?

49
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:20,105
I'll fill this villa with
toys when my nephew arrives.

50
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,776
And I'll play horse
for him all the time.

51
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:27,110
- Really?
- Yes.

52
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:31,114
If you're going to play â€œhorse"
for him all the time...

53
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:36,116
-...when will you find time for her?
- For her? Who are you talking of?

54
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:40,783
For the one to whom this
nose-ring belongs.

55
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:46,622
- Nose-ring! But...
- Tell me, who's the girl you love'?

56
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:52,468
- Who are you speaking of?
- So you're telling me a lie!

57
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,475
- Djrou want me to tell you'?
- Tell me quick.

58
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,614
Shall I tell <i>you...)
</i> well all right, I'll tell you.

59
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:11,581
Her name is Chand. She's
Chowdhary Sarang's younger sister.

60
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:20,555
- Chanel!
- Yes, brotherm?

61
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:26,571
Even birds return to their nests by
evening. Where have you been so long?

62
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:35,376
He's anxious when you're late. He's
sent all servants to look for you.

63
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,379
Where is your nose-ring?

64
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:47,626
It must have fallen off
somewhere in the fields.

65
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,252
Never mind. You may go.

66
00:15:55,701 --> 00:16:02,471
Have the entire estate
searched thoroughly.

67
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:07,143
My sister's nose ring
has been lost.

68
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:11,581
I do not want that anyone should
even chance to tread over it.

69
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:15,085
- What If someone has picked It up?
- Bheema I

70
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:25,093
If anyone has picked it up,
kill him!

71
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,315
We've been searching the whole
day. There's no sign of the nose-ring.

72
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,114
Go on searching till you find it!
Go on!

73
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:57,118
Why are you standing here
on the hilltop?

74
00:16:57,697 --> 00:17:01,065
Its just that I'd
happened to come here.

75
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:13,736
And seen from a height, distances
sometimes seem to diminish...

76
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:21,085
...and differences, sometimes,
stand out so clearly.

77
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:31,421
- I do not understand,
- Differences distance us, Chand.

78
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:41,768
Will your brother, the owner
of such large estates, agree...

79
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:46,441
...to give his sister to
a family of farmers like us?

80
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:57,621
The fate of our love
is sealed, Chaand.

81
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:02,227
- And what does take decree?
- Separation!

82
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:13,070
No! That can't be. Our love will be
requited either in union or in death.

83
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:37,427
If you've found the nose-ring,
Chaand is your sister, just as she is mine.

84
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:47,095
And if you have not, I'll bury
you in the same soil...

85
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,439
Where Chaand's
nose-ring lies hidden.

86
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,102
It would've surely been found,
had it been lost, Sir.

87
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:57,111
I think she has
given it to someone.

88
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:04,052
I have seen her with my own eyes,
in a loving embrace with Shiva.

89
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:13,060
Why did you have do shoot him?

90
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:21,200
The tongue doesn't
stop wagging...

91
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:25,405
...whetherm in front of me,
or in front of others.

92
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:31,414
- What ever did he tell you?
- Something I cannot even imagine of.

93
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:34,075
What has happened?
say something at leastl!

94
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:37,415
I cannot being myself to
narrate what has happened.

95
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:43,092
But whatever it is, it has happened
for the first time in our family.

96
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,094
- Chaandl
- What ls It brothefl

97
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:57,565
Answer a question of mine.

98
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:03,105
Tell me, which is the most valuable
ornament that a man can possess?

99
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,113
Why don't you tell me what it is?

100
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:14,582
The Rakish (Ceremonial-string a
sister ties on her brother's right wrist)

101
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:20,861
When you were born, I was
happy thinking that...

102
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,225
...the Goddess of
wealth has come.

103
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:27,295
And that I'd receive
a Rakish from you.

104
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:34,472
Little did I know that you'd
consign me to the living dead.

105
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:39,142
And that you'd forget that one
mustn't tie a Rakish on the dead.

106
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:45,647
- I don't understand, Brother.
- And neither do I understand this.

107
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,158
I'd heard that the moon
(Chand) is only eclipsed.

108
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:59,568
But I didn't know the moon (Chand)
seeks shameless pleasures.

109
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:06,611
Tell me, which desire of yours is it,
that I've left unfulfilled?

110
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,115
I've laid my heart at your feet.

111
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:18,120
Tell me, tell me for the
sake of the sacred Rakish...

112
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:21,791
...where my love for you
as your brother has failed...

113
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:24,458
...that you have brought
such dishonour upon me?

114
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:38,137
I could never have imagined that
my own blood would betray me.

115
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:44,642
- I want do shoot myself.
- It's not a crime to love, is it?

116
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:50,645
Had love not been a crime, women
wouldn't have to wear veils...

117
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:53,648
and people would never build
high walls around their houses.

118
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:58,160
And, if love were not a crime, you
wouldn't have done it secretly.

119
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:02,092
A mother gives birth to her
child secretly. Is that a crime?

120
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:07,103
She hides her child while suckling.
Is that a crime?

121
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:11,438
Even God stays hidden.
Is that too a crime, Brother?

122
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:17,277
The strength of
a man is his eyes.

123
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,111
The strength of a woman
lies in her tongue.

124
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:26,715
For the first time in your life,
you stand before me...

125
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:30,125
...not in a trial of love,
but in a trial of strength.

126
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:34,458
You may have changed your
attitude, but I stand unwavered.

127
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,134
I shall cleanse my honor with
no less than a blood bath!

128
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:52,806
- Put the broken glass together.
- Broken glass can't be put together!

129
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:55,481
So also can broken honor
never be put together!

130
00:22:57,189 --> 00:23:03,094
If a man loses character,
a single generation is lost.

131
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:08,433
When a single woman loses
character, many generations are destroyed!

132
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:16,573
Stop! Stop? If you shoot her,
people will speak even more.

133
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:22,104
It'd be best to get
her married off?

134
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:25,578
D'you mean to say that I should
knowingly pass off a rotten egg?

135
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:29,710
- Yes.
- A selfish and greedy man would"

136
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:36,126
- Chowdhary Sarang can never do
that! - I shall do it then.

137
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:46,305
Ganga has told me everything.
It'd be better if you forget Chand.

138
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:49,471
You're inviting your own death
by falling in love with her.

139
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:52,644
- Better forget her.
- I cannot forget her.

140
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:58,541
As far as Chowdhary Sarang
is concerned, he's no God...

141
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:01,581
that he may kill anyone or let
anyone live according to his wishes.

142
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:12,426
Don't be depressed, Shiva.
I'll go and meet him personally.

143
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:16,432
Who knows, he might even
accept the proposal.

144
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,606
I will go to meet Chowdhary myself.

145
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:30,105
I don't mind being insulted by one.
who won't even accept a garland.

146
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,598
- You!
- My brother knows about us.

147
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:52,633
He wants to get me
married off somewhere else.

148
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:59,137
So I've left everything behind,
and come to you.

149
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,745
You shouldn't have come like this.
People in our society won't like it.

150
00:25:07,086 --> 00:25:14,618
Women who run away at night
are taunted by day.

151
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,751
Its the death for them.

152
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:19,497
You will certainly come into
this household. You certainly will.

153
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:23,226
But we want to receive
Chowdhary Sarang's Sister...

154
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:25,700
...with formal honours.

155
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:31,771
I shall go to meet Chowdhary
tomorrow and speak of an alliance.

156
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:36,109
Don't worry, my child.
Come, I shall escort you home.

157
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:10,072
Our daughters leave their paternal
homes in marriage processions...

158
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:13,079
...and leave the homes of
their in-laws after death.

159
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:17,246
You've tried to break
the tradition.

160
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:20,221
You've tried to create
a new tradition, Chand.

161
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:26,091
That is something Chowdhary
Sarang can ever tolerate.

162
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:33,763
No! Chowdhary, don't! She's
innocent! Don't do it to her.

163
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:41,570
- She is your sister Chowdhary.
- Yes! She is my sister!

164
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:46,774
A sister who was
the light of my eyes.

165
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:52,119
The sister who is now a
tear dropped from my eye.

166
00:26:55,227 --> 00:26:59,596
And a tear that has dropped
can never come back.

167
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:04,467
Don't say such things.
They haven't done anything wrong.

168
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:08,062
They have loved each other.

169
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,732
And love is the greatest
gift from God.

170
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:16,580
If love be a gift of God,
I'd rather be an atheist!

171
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:23,814
I'd destroy anyone, who as much as
utters the word â€œlove" here.

172
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:26,280
You can never destroy â€œLove"!

173
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:33,087
Can you reverse the
direction of a river...

174
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:36,631
...that flows through
your territory'?

175
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:44,108
No, you cannot force your
will on people in love.

176
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:54,509
Love will live forever. Those who try
to destroy love, will be vanquished.

177
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,451
- Shiva I
- I am the one to fault, my brother.

178
00:28:01,126 --> 00:28:03,117
Punish me, if you must!

179
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:10,729
You've started playing your dirty
â€œrole" in my presence!

180
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:13,394
- No, brother
- You fallen woman!

181
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:15,596
No! No, this can't be.

182
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:58,432
Don't!
Don't leave me alone like this.

183
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:03,170
I'm left all alone.

184
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:10,120
Have I made you unhappy
by speaking out for Shiva?

185
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:16,261
- Shiva!
- I'll fill this villa with toys...

186
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:21,729
...when my nephew arrives.
And I'll play horse...

187
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:26,128
for him all the time.
- Oh Shiva!

188
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:14,108
You have left me too!

189
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:06,595
I swear by the pyres
of my dead...

190
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:17,106
...that I shall destroy the pride of
the man who has devastated my family.

191
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:31,124
I beg of you, God...

192
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:37,125
...give me a son.
Please give me a son.

193
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:52,809
None even dare carry
the ashes of their dead...

194
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:55,142
...through my estates,
without my permission.

195
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,311
Who is it that celebrates?

196
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:15,296
Stop it!

197
00:33:38,463 --> 00:33:41,626
Ganga!
Are you still alive'?

198
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:50,137
Even if you'd escaped my bullets,
you should've died of terror.

199
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:55,304
You have not died. I see.
And today, you've come here too!

200
00:33:55,614 --> 00:33:57,480
I've come here to share
my happiness with you.

201
00:33:57,816 --> 00:34:00,751
Happiness! Arising from the
destruction of yourfamily, is it?

202
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:08,257
Ho. I'm happy because I've just
given birth to your son-in-law.

203
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:19,267
I've come to further the bondage
of love that you tried to break.

204
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:29,774
Now you won't be able to stop
the union of lovers-to-be.

205
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:38,655
People have seen glass shattering.
They'll now see rock shattered too.

206
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:42,788
I'm not rock. I'm the steel
that cuts through rock.

207
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:48,633
And I'm the guardian angel of the
fiery love that will melt steel.

208
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:58,471
Now, Sarang. You must await
the day when my son will...

209
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:07,581
come here to marry your
daughter and take her away.

210
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:13,585
And then you can go back to tending
the fields of your estates.

211
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:16,090
No! Don't

212
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:19,756
For the first time, a woman
has challenged Sarang...

213
00:35:20,131 --> 00:35:22,122
and has lit a burning
fire of hatred in my heart.

214
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:26,101
Let this fire burn.
Let this fire burn on.

215
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:31,103
I like to enjoy
the heat of hatred.

216
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:35,780
I accept your challenge, Ganga.

217
00:35:37,716 --> 00:35:39,707
I accept your challenge!

218
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:42,780
No one may stop Ganga from
entering or leaving this house.

219
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:47,623
But there is one question
that I must ask you, Ganga.

220
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,125
Tell me, have you turned mad?

221
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:54,855
You speak of your son
marrying my daughter.

222
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:57,130
But I have no daughter at all.

223
00:35:57,669 --> 00:36:00,400
And neither are there any
signs of a pregnancy.

224
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:05,404
Laugh! Have a good hearty laugh!

225
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:14,412
But remember, that one who
laughs last, laughs most.

226
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:18,745
And I shall have the last laugh.

227
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:24,227
You are a landlord,
accustomed to the grain only.

228
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:30,626
We're farmers and know
from the scent of soil...

229
00:36:31,102 --> 00:36:36,097
...when seeds may
yield the first shoots.

230
00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:44,109
Seven months from now, you
are going to be a father.

231
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,644
Why don't you ask your wife
if you have any doubts?

232
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:59,457
And, you will have a daughter.

233
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:06,397
As a woman, you might have
known what you've said so far.

234
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:12,733
But how can you say whether a
son may be born or a daughter?

235
00:37:14,078 --> 00:37:20,074
Without the sky and the earth,
this world would've been incomplete.

236
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:23,083
If I have borne the sky...
(figuratively, a son)

237
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:27,824
then it's you who must bear
the earth (a daughter, figuratively).

238
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:33,094
- Then only will the story end.
- I'm the one who'll kill the story.

239
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:38,597
But first, the story must begin.

240
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:45,109
I shall pray that God
gives me a daughter.

241
00:37:46,444 --> 00:37:48,776
And may your son live long
enough...

242
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,444
...that he may lead his wedding
procession to my doors.

243
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,781
You must have a sweet then,
for what you've wished is true.

244
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:03,560
- I've tasted blood Ganga.
- Then you must wash your mouth.

245
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:06,119
Because, its with your own
mouth that you must...

246
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:08,392
...call the priest to preside over
the marriage. If the priest...

247
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,400
...sees blood on your mouth,
he'd run away scared.

248
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:19,067
I have priests who preside over
marriages as well as death rites.

249
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:26,216
Have the most delectable
of fruits and condiments...

250
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:29,079
...sent to Ganga's house, so that
her son may grew up soon.

251
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:35,416
My son doesn't fancy fruits.
He'd rather see your head...

252
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:37,618
...bowed while you give away
your daughter in marriage.

253
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,258
<i>Remember this one thing. Gang-a'.!</i>

254
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:48,095
That Sarang would rather be
beheaded then lose his honor!

255
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:51,758
What are you doing!
Why are you giving the child...

256
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:53,730
...a cold-water bath
in this chilly season?

257
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:04,605
I want my son to be hardened.

258
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:21,128
"I've sworn it by you; you must
keep your mother's honor"

259
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:27,137
"One day you must
Humiliate him before are"

260
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:49,156
"It's your duty to
punish the wicked fellow"

261
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:57,163
"And that is why your mother
has named you 'Shiv-ram' "

262
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:23,651
- What a beautiful baby girl.
- Seems like people from the...

263
00:41:23,795 --> 00:41:26,127
...mother's home have
come to congratulate her.

264
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:54,348
Congratulation! Now we'll be able
to get related through a marriage.

265
00:41:57,528 --> 00:42:00,429
Why have you come ever leaving
your child behind, Ganga?

266
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,092
The poor fellow must
be crying all alone.

267
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,768
After all, you have a duty
towards him too, don't you?

268
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:13,309
If you have to pay off
the doctor and this butcher...

269
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:16,104
I'd rather that you
paid off this butcher first.

270
00:42:32,463 --> 00:42:34,625
My daughter-in-law is beautiful!
Which is just fine.

271
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:43,472
For the more beautiful the bride,
the more passionate will my son be!

272
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:53,475
Will you not ask me Sarang,
what I've named your son-in-law?

273
00:42:55,153 --> 00:42:59,147
His name is Shiva. Shiva!

274
00:42:59,624 --> 00:43:08,430
I've come to tell you that the
love story that you destroyed...

275
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:10,690
...has started afresh.
All over again

276
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:16,105
And I've named my daughter Chanel.
Chanel!

277
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:20,269
So that I can remind you how
the earlier story had ended.

278
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:26,447
This relationship will prove
quite dear for you, Ganga.

279
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:29,652
That comes later. After the
relationship has been forged.

280
00:43:31,255 --> 00:43:35,624
Take a look at the gifts I've
brought for my daughter-in-law.

281
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:39,121
A garland of sandalwood;
pearl earrings.

282
00:43:45,703 --> 00:43:52,632
Bangles and bracelets of gold.

283
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:57,479
And here is the engagement ring.

284
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,414
Who will put it on here finger?
Will you, or shall I?

285
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:07,091
Never mind then,
I'll put it on her finger.

286
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:21,104
Why don't you give birth
to another daughter?

287
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:27,444
She'd be a perfect bridesmaid.

288
00:44:27,712 --> 00:44:29,703
Else, it won't be fun.

289
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,614
Make sure your son
grows up fast, Ganga.

290
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:40,257
So that I can anoint
my daughter with his blood.

291
00:44:40,524 --> 00:44:42,788
If you want my son's
blood for anointing...

292
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:47,621
my daughter-in-law,
why must you have to wait?

293
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:06,079
I'm his mother. It's my blood
that flows in his veins.

294
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:18,756
I've satisfied your
desire, Sarang.

295
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:23,596
Now you should declare the'
engagement of Chaand to Shiva...

296
00:45:24,302 --> 00:45:28,432
...so that the villagers
may come to congratulate you.

297
00:45:33,611 --> 00:45:38,310
She keeps on speaking of her son.
If you so desire, I can kill him.

298
00:45:38,616 --> 00:45:44,612
No. The harvest in better
after the crop has ripened.

299
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,451
Let him grow up.

300
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:50,456
"I'll make you walk on thorns"

301
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:56,131
"I'll lay you on a bed of fire"

302
00:46:10,181 --> 00:46:13,082
"I'll forge you of iron."

303
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:26,563
"None in this world, my dear
will be able to break you"

304
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:34,103
"And that is why your Mother
has named you Shivam"

305
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:11,064
Come in, Ganga. You can see for
your self howl hold my hear high. Yet!

306
00:47:11,575 --> 00:47:15,739
I hear that your high head is
now burdened with diseases.

307
00:47:17,782 --> 00:47:21,582
But my head isn't yet
about to fall off.

308
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:26,087
You must be quite unhappy
at seeing me alive.

309
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:29,683
For you must've come here
praying for my death.

310
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:35,099
Those that pray for death
and disease are cowards.

311
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:38,431
I've just come from the temple,
after praying...

312
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:41,436
...that you
may live very long.

313
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:47,374
Not only that. I've brought
medicines as well...

314
00:47:47,545 --> 00:47:50,105
...so that you may live long.

315
00:47:58,823 --> 00:48:04,523
All of them are reputed doctors.
They will look after you.

316
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:16,063
Priests! As long as he is not fully
recovered, you must

317
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:22,076
say the prayers and keep on
performing the holy rituals.

318
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:32,080
Why do you trouble yourself? A little
illness won't do me any harm.

319
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:39,427
- Don't worry. I'm not going to die.
- Even if you died, Sarang...

320
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:42,428
...I wouldn't let you go,

321
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:49,171
I'll fight God, if I have to...

322
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:56,602
...for letting my enemy live.

323
00:48:58,616 --> 00:49:05,044
I have a promise to keep.

324
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:18,725
I hear you accept contracts
for killing people.

325
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:22,395
- That's true. How many people?
- Just one.

326
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:26,743
Do we have to break his legs
or is he to be killed?

327
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:29,168
- Kill him!
- The price is 10,000.

328
00:49:31,415 --> 00:49:33,406
Where can we find him?

329
00:49:46,597 --> 00:49:50,158
Just when I was about to
get the girl in my dream

330
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:55,601
- Well, what is it?
- Are you Shiva?

331
00:49:56,106 --> 00:49:58,438
I'm neither Shiva nor his
divine consort, Parvati.

332
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:01,134
I'm merely Bajrangi.
Greetings, Sirs!

333
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:03,403
- Where is Shiva?
- I don't Know.

334
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:06,105
- Tell me, Where Shiva is'?
- I don't know.

335
00:50:10,854 --> 00:50:13,448
Are you rehearing with we for
your appointment with Shiva?

336
00:50:13,624 --> 00:50:15,456
Hi there!

337
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:34,469
I'm Shiva.

338
00:50:54,698 --> 00:50:56,166
- Why did you beat me up'?
- Get out!

339
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:00,435
Why did you beat me up?

340
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,112
Why did you beat me up?

341
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,268
Get ready for the
execution my child.

342
00:52:47,678 --> 00:52:48,668
Shiva!

343
00:52:57,287 --> 00:53:02,088
Till this day, I've kept you
away from home, Shiva.

344
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:06,588
I've force you to
live a harsh life.

345
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:13,601
I've imperilled you time
and again, to test you.

346
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:20,436
And you have never asked
me why I have done so.

347
00:53:21,779 --> 00:53:25,773
- Why have you never asked me?
- A clay pot never ask the potter...

348
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:28,107
...why it is put through fire.

349
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,613
The potter merely moulds the clay.
But you've given birth to me, Mother.

350
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:37,116
How can I ever ask you
such a question?

351
00:54:09,493 --> 00:54:11,086
Please don't go any further, Sir.

352
00:54:11,228 --> 00:54:13,424
Chowdhary Sarang's territory
starts from the other side.

353
00:54:18,602 --> 00:54:20,764
- Who's that?
- She's Chowdhaly Sarang': daughter.

354
00:54:29,847 --> 00:54:32,441
- Who are you'?
- I'm the son of Hari Singh...

355
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:34,608
...the landlord of Bharatpur.
My name is Ranbir Singh.

356
00:54:35,853 --> 00:54:38,117
My horse has crossed
into your territory.

357
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:43,117
Thank you very much
for catching my horse.

358
00:54:46,563 --> 00:54:50,625
I like this horse. Tell me, how much
money do you want for it?

359
00:54:51,235 --> 00:54:54,637
I like the horse too. I'm not
willing to sell it at all.

360
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:02,743
I must have for myself,
whatever it is that I like.

361
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:09,082
That's my habit too. I don't like
to give away objects of my desire.

362
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:16,419
Rustom! Rustom!

363
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:48,114
I hear that you have killed.
Ranbir Singh's horse

364
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:51,792
The footsteps of one that trespasses
into our territory may be found...

365
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:54,791
...but those footsteps
cannot go back.

366
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:58,133
- How would I let the horse go?
- Well sald, Chanel.

367
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:04,740
- Heard that! She speaks like me!
- Why don't you accept the fact...

368
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:09,410
...that you have a daughter?
You must bring her up as a woman.

369
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:12,071
You haven't even allowed
her to dress up as a woman.

370
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:14,407
Neither do I ever want
to dress up as a woman.

371
00:56:14,618 --> 00:56:24,084
- Did you hear that?
- Doesn't at all resemble a woman.

372
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:28,757
She's grown into such a terror, that
even her mother in scared of her.

373
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:38,702
If you the mother is scared of her,
how d'you think Ganga will react?

374
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:43,610
- Who's this Ganaga?
- Twenty years ago

375
00:56:44,514 --> 00:56:52,114
...she'd challenged me that her son
would marry you and take you away.

376
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:55,524
It was on that very day
that I swore...

377
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:59,128
...that the very day, her son
comes here to marry you...

378
00:56:59,363 --> 00:57:02,389
...I will anoint your
hands with his blood.

379
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:06,400
If I must anoint myself,
why must it be my hands only?

380
00:57:06,703 --> 00:57:13,575
I swear that I'll paint my hand and
my feet red with her son's blood!

381
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:19,239
I have brought you up
like a man, Chand.

382
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,619
Even when you hadn't
learn to sit up...

383
00:57:22,786 --> 00:57:25,084
...I fired all the
maidservants in this house.

384
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:28,750
So that there wouldn't be a woman
in the household apart from your mother.

385
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:32,426
And I've also prevented you
from meeting her too often.

386
00:57:34,398 --> 00:57:38,596
You have been brought up
amongst men.

387
00:57:39,703 --> 00:57:44,698
And I have taught you
every an mastered by men...

388
00:57:44,841 --> 00:57:47,435
...like shooting archery
and horse-riding.

389
00:57:47,844 --> 00:57:49,608
And you have learn well my dear.

390
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:56,115
Now, there remains only one other
thing that you must learn.

391
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:01,056
Every year, during the festival
of the Goddess Durga...

392
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:03,182
...I have been making
the ritual slaughter.

393
00:58:03,593 --> 00:58:06,563
This year, you will have to
offer the ritual slaughter.

394
00:58:18,742 --> 00:58:22,406
And, you must use your left hand
to slaughter the beast.

395
00:58:23,547 --> 00:58:25,743
Because, it was on a
finger of this hand...

396
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:28,415
...that Ganga put
on the engagement ring.

397
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:35,418
You shall not travel to
the temple on horse back.

398
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,596
Those traveling to the ritual
slaughter, must go on the elephant.

399
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:53,440
The woman inside Chaand
will die forever...

400
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:55,771
...if she performs
the ritual sacrifice.

401
00:58:56,113 --> 00:58:58,104
That is exactly what I want!

402
00:59:00,183 --> 00:59:02,379
The killing of a beast
is a were excuse.

403
00:59:04,121 --> 00:59:09,059
I want her to sacrifice the
woman she is, at heart.

404
01:00:32,609 --> 01:00:35,476
She will slaughter the
sacrificial beast this time.

405
01:00:35,745 --> 01:00:37,736
That's the order of
Chowdhary Sarang.

406
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:21,547
A woman cannot perform
the sacrificial slaughter.

407
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:24,790
This is a temple where
the holy writ is inviolate.

408
01:01:25,128 --> 01:01:27,119
Your father can'! order anything.

409
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:01,096
Who dare stop Chand from
performing the sacrificial slaughter?

410
01:02:01,264 --> 01:02:04,757
It's the first time we've seen him.
I don't know where he comes from.

411
01:02:05,235 --> 01:02:07,761
- Neither do we know his family.
- Find him and kill him.

412
01:02:08,104 --> 01:02:10,095
No. Leave him to me.

413
01:02:12,676 --> 01:02:16,772
He prevented me from offering
sacrificial slaughter.

414
01:02:17,113 --> 01:02:19,172
I'll slaughter him.

415
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:29,785
You haven't done the right thing
by slaughtering the buffalo.

416
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:33,520
- Why so?
- You have no Idea of...

417
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:35,789
...how powerful Chowdhary Sarang
is. And he's a merciless fellow.

418
01:02:38,802 --> 01:02:42,466
Neither am I scared of Sarang nor
of his foolish obstinate daughter.

419
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:46,132
I won't let him
destroy our traditions.

420
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:50,275
I'm ready to face
death for that.

421
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:53,140
I appreciate your courage, Shiva.

422
01:02:54,217 --> 01:02:58,154
But Chowdhaly Sarang ls inhuman.
He's a Satan.

423
01:02:59,189 --> 01:03:02,250
Even the angels of death
would be shocked when...

424
01:03:02,425 --> 01:03:05,087
he goes on a rampage.
Lives of men mean little to him.

425
01:03:06,463 --> 01:03:09,262
I have personally been a
witness to one such incident.

426
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:12,658
I've have seen it
with my own eyes.

427
01:03:13,203 --> 01:03:18,266
My own eyes that once dreamt
of love and happiness.

428
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:23,344
It was the death of my lover.

429
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:44,534
I won't kill you. I'll let you live;
I'll let you live.

430
01:03:46,636 --> 01:03:48,798
So that lovers may see you
living amidst death...

431
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:53,474
...and remember the
terror that I wreak...

432
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:58,638
...so that no more
lovers are here.

433
01:04:47,831 --> 01:04:49,299
Come with us.

434
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:20,425
- Who the hell are you'?
- Let the girl go.

435
01:05:21,698 --> 01:05:24,429
- Why? Is she your sister?
- She may be your sister...

436
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:26,761
She's my...well,
I hope you understand.

437
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:04,073
Hey! the least you can
do is to thank me.

438
01:06:04,607 --> 01:06:08,407
- For what'?
- For having saved your life.

439
01:06:09,546 --> 01:06:12,072
Whoever asked you
to get involved?

440
01:06:12,415 --> 01:06:15,407
I'm quite capable of
handling hoodlums myself.

441
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:20,088
- I have the necessary strength.
- You've no strength at all!

442
01:06:20,323 --> 01:06:23,759
You're a soft, silly and proud girl.
All you can do is...

443
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:26,755
...to crush poor helpless people
under your horse's hoofs...

444
01:06:27,163 --> 01:06:29,154
...or shoot mute animals.

445
01:06:31,568 --> 01:06:35,095
This is a ,man's hand!
And, remember that...

446
01:06:35,305 --> 01:06:38,104
...you're a woman. And you mustn't
try to behave like a man.

447
01:06:49,819 --> 01:06:53,653
I regret that even in this
second meeting...

448
01:06:53,856 --> 01:06:56,120
...we haven't yet crossed
the stage of blood-letting.

449
01:07:18,147 --> 01:07:23,085
Step folwanimstep forward!
mstep folwardll

450
01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:31,754
You get beaten up by a girl!

451
01:07:35,598 --> 01:07:37,589
Now I shall have to
do something myself.

452
01:07:47,377 --> 01:07:49,368
Have you gone mad?
What are you doing?

453
01:07:50,179 --> 01:07:52,773
I want to keep
this wound alive.

454
01:07:55,118 --> 01:07:58,179
How will lfeel love,
if this dries up?

455
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:05,056
This is a man's hand!
And remembers that...

456
01:08:05,328 --> 01:08:08,195
...you're a woman. And you
mustn't behave like a man

457
01:08:19,275 --> 01:08:21,266
- Milk for you, Mr. Chand.
- Get out of my way.

458
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:24,069
Father!

459
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:28,473
- Where's my father?
- He may be inside.

460
01:08:29,252 --> 01:08:33,587
- What's the matter Chaand?
- I'm going to Kishenganj.

461
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:37,420
- I'll stay there for 5 or 6 days.
- Take a look at the crops there.

462
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:42,425
No. You'd rather go
hunting over there.

463
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:45,557
That way, you'll enjoy yourself

464
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:49,432
Don't worry if I am
missing, tracking a hunt.

465
01:08:50,773 --> 01:08:53,765
When the lion hunts,
people are worried

466
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:57,441
But those of a lion's family
aren't bothered

467
01:08:58,314 --> 01:09:00,373
You may go.

468
01:09:07,056 --> 01:09:11,721
- What's this noise all about?
- Ganga has arrived.

469
01:09:39,088 --> 01:09:42,752
Sarang! Near is the day when
you'll become a grand father.

470
01:09:44,427 --> 01:09:49,092
Very soon your daughter will
give birth to my grandson.

471
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:53,101
Till they actually deliver...

472
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:59,606
every girl is irked
at the mention of it.

473
01:09:59,776 --> 01:10:01,767
You're right, Ganga

474
01:10:05,114 --> 01:10:13,113
My son has grown up, Sarang,
and he's passionate too.

475
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:18,288
I want the marriage to take
place at the earliest.

476
01:10:19,629 --> 01:10:23,122
For 20 years,
I've been planning...

477
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:30,135
the perfect execution
for your son...

478
01:10:30,873 --> 01:10:34,309
...so that no â€œGanga" may
ever dare to challenge Sarang.

479
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:41,607
All that you must decide now is the
date of your daughter's marriage.

480
01:10:42,185 --> 01:10:46,486
That very date on which you
want to see your son dead.

481
01:10:46,823 --> 01:10:48,814
You mustn't speak of a bridegroom
in this manner when...

482
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:51,149
...the bride is listening.

483
01:10:51,394 --> 01:10:55,160
- Father!
- The father's pampered daughter?

484
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:57,825
Will you just go on reciting
your father's name?

485
01:10:58,367 --> 01:11:00,768
Would you like to know
your husband's name?

486
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:04,766
Shall I tell you his name?
It's lovely.

487
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,432
I don't want to
hear his name!

488
01:11:15,251 --> 01:11:19,654
Chand would even set
the world afire.

489
01:11:20,723 --> 01:11:25,285
If she can light as much as
a cooking hearth, I'll be happy.

490
01:11:27,296 --> 01:11:30,459
What if she sets fire to
your son's funeral pyre?

491
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:36,637
That can never be.
You haven't see my son.

492
01:11:37,707 --> 01:11:44,636
If you ever get to see him, your eyes
will turn white out of fear

493
01:11:45,147 --> 01:11:47,138
But where is this son of yours?

494
01:11:47,283 --> 01:11:50,150
You'll see him when he
comes as a bridegroom.

495
01:12:08,638 --> 01:12:13,098
I know that you have many
men in your employ.

496
01:12:13,509 --> 01:12:16,308
But, it just may be, that
there would be a shortage...

497
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:18,604
...of weapons on the
day of the marriage.

498
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:20,772
Keep these, will you?

499
01:12:21,183 --> 01:12:28,783
So that when you're forced to bow
your head before my son...

500
01:12:29,225 --> 01:12:33,662
...you shouldn't have any
excuses left for your defeat.

501
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:45,640
As a woman, how can you speak of
such horrible things, Ganga?

502
01:12:53,182 --> 01:12:59,485
Women are those that live under
the shadow of love in the family.

503
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:03,087
But, one who is burdened

504
01:13:03,326 --> 01:13:11,097
...with the destruction
of her family...

505
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:21,103
...is a far cry from womanhood.

506
01:13:22,378 --> 01:13:30,581
A cry that could tear
the skies apart.

507
01:14:09,425 --> 01:14:11,416
Chand, my daughter-in-law to be!

508
01:14:11,627 --> 01:14:13,618
You've done just the
right thing, dear...

509
01:14:14,096 --> 01:14:19,091
...by smashing up all these
old things. I wanted just this!

510
01:14:19,769 --> 01:14:23,706
To throw out all this old furniture
and bring in new furniture.

511
01:14:25,107 --> 01:14:29,442
So that, the day you come here
as a newly wedded bride...

512
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:32,113
...you can have new
things for yourself.

513
01:14:33,883 --> 01:14:41,119
Well...well, let's do something;
let's go shopping, you and I...

514
01:14:41,724 --> 01:14:45,627
...you can tell me whatever it
is that you happen to like.

515
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:50,688
And I'll buy it for you!
Say what!

516
01:15:05,314 --> 01:15:09,080
The very house you've just
destroyed, isn't your father's.

517
01:15:10,786 --> 01:15:13,255
It belongs to my mother.
It belongs to me!

518
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:20,261
"I swear, I'll paint my hands and
my feet red with her son's blood!"

519
01:15:43,853 --> 01:15:49,121
The snake-charmer has just started
to suck out your venom!

520
01:15:58,134 --> 01:16:00,398
Your son seems to have fallen
in love with Sarang's daughter.

521
01:16:00,669 --> 01:16:04,071
I've seen him with my own eyes.
He picked her up and took her away.

522
01:16:07,643 --> 01:16:11,079
- You're laughing!
- I'm laughing, because...

523
01:16:13,149 --> 01:16:16,608
my son has treaded
on the right path...

524
01:16:17,086 --> 01:16:23,514
I didn't have to tell him.

525
01:16:49,351 --> 01:16:51,342
Why have you brought me here?

526
01:16:52,388 --> 01:16:54,379
- To make a woman out of you!
- What djrou mean?

527
01:16:55,124 --> 01:16:57,650
A woman can't turn into a man
by donning a man's clothes.

528
01:16:58,594 --> 01:17:02,588
I want to break your false pride and
each teach you the ways of women.

529
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:06,725
You've forgetting that I'm not
Chowdhary Sarang's daughter...

530
01:17:07,069 --> 01:17:08,230
...I'm his son!

531
01:17:08,404 --> 01:17:11,533
I've learn how to live with my head
held high. I can't bow my head.

532
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:14,733
- Now let me go!
- So you want to leave!

533
01:17:17,813 --> 01:17:19,804
Wear this saree (traditional
dress for women) and...you may leave.

534
01:17:20,216 --> 01:17:22,207
No one will stop you.

535
01:17:22,651 --> 01:17:26,087
- I won't near the saree?
- And I won't let you go...

536
01:17:26,222 --> 01:17:28,213
...unless you wear it.

537
01:18:27,616 --> 01:18:35,421
Don't try to escape. If you want to
go away, you must wear the saree.

538
01:19:26,308 --> 01:19:29,073
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet. But I'm very hungry.

539
01:19:30,312 --> 01:19:35,409
I'm not asking about you, glutton!
I'm asking about that wild cat.

540
01:19:36,085 --> 01:19:40,420
- Now go and give her some food.
- Ho! Hot me.

541
01:19:41,357 --> 01:19:43,416
- Go on, I said!
- Well, I'm going. I'm going.

542
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:12,343
I'll break your legs if
you ever come here again.

543
01:20:53,829 --> 01:20:55,820
- Have you fixed her?
- Yes.

544
01:22:12,174 --> 01:22:15,109
What are you going to do now?
You have to neat the saree now.

545
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,456
She's coming out
without her clothes.

546
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:52,144
No matter what you do,
I'll never wear the saree.

547
01:22:53,549 --> 01:22:55,643
You're an obstinate daughter
of an arrogant father!

548
01:22:56,151 --> 01:23:00,145
You must warm up by the fire; the
water's cold and the weather chilly.

549
01:23:00,322 --> 01:23:03,758
Otherwise, you'll turn stiff-bodied
as your father is stiff-necked.

550
01:23:04,459 --> 01:23:07,827
And you'd turn as
thin as a stick!

551
01:24:00,349 --> 01:24:04,252
Give some hot tea to that wild cat.
Else, she'll go stiff with cold.

552
01:24:04,453 --> 01:24:08,083
Me! Why d'you want to
send me to my death?

553
01:24:08,323 --> 01:24:12,760
The last time, she scratched my
face. God knows what she'll do this time.

554
01:24:13,228 --> 01:24:17,597
- Bajrangll
- Well, all rlght. I'll go.

555
01:24:33,215 --> 01:24:35,775
She's very sick! I hope she
doesn't die. Now come along.

556
01:25:31,106 --> 01:25:34,599
- What are you doing?
- She's in a bad condition.

557
01:25:35,243 --> 01:25:37,109
And we don't have enough
time to call a doctor.

558
01:25:39,114 --> 01:25:42,311
I'll have to give her
body heat to save here.

559
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:04,725
What are you doing!
Have you gone mad?

560
01:27:05,066 --> 01:27:07,057
Get out of my way! He has raped
me. I won't spare him!

561
01:27:08,303 --> 01:27:11,398
No! D'you want to kill someone
who has saved your life?

562
01:27:12,073 --> 01:27:15,737
Whatever he did last night has saved
you from the clutches of death.

563
01:27:16,178 --> 01:27:19,637
Had he not warmed your body last
night, using his body heat...

564
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:21,408
...you'd have been
a corpse by now.

565
01:27:22,617 --> 01:27:28,420
If Shiva has touched you, it has
been with honourable intentions.

566
01:27:29,191 --> 01:27:33,594
His touch brought you back to life,
your honor is untouched.

567
01:27:34,696 --> 01:27:38,223
Believe me.
You're still as pure.

568
01:27:40,802 --> 01:27:45,103
And I'm a witness to it. I was
here throughout last night.

569
01:28:37,092 --> 01:28:39,254
You may go home, Chand.

570
01:28:41,296 --> 01:28:46,097
You had me imprisoned while
I hated you, while I raged...

571
01:28:46,635 --> 01:28:51,436
Now that I'm in love...

572
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:56,601
Is this your love for me? Your
hatred was better than your love.

573
01:28:57,512 --> 01:29:00,379
At least, I had the
right to be hated!

574
01:29:06,054 --> 01:29:11,049
After 18 years of exile,
I've returned to myself today.

575
01:29:13,128 --> 01:29:18,726
Love me.
Give me all your love, Shiva.

576
01:29:56,338 --> 01:30:05,110
"I'll live in your arms
I'll die in your arms"

577
01:30:06,514 --> 01:30:15,116
"I'll die in your arms
I'll live in your arms"

578
01:30:17,692 --> 01:30:25,122
"The season of the rains,
is the season for love"

579
01:31:49,818 --> 01:31:54,813
"The fabric that envelopes
your fair skin"

580
01:31:55,223 --> 01:31:59,160
"The mascarae that shades
your eyes with a shyness"

581
01:32:16,177 --> 01:32:23,607
"Lips like petals to be kissed;
And dewdrops on your cheek"

582
01:33:39,694 --> 01:33:49,627
"Never have I seen, lover of mine,
one as mad as you are"

583
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:14,422
"You do look like a simpleton;
But you're a snake at heart"

584
01:35:13,621 --> 01:35:23,087
"My heart tells me, my love,
to give you all my life"

585
01:35:36,844 --> 01:35:42,112
"I've given this youth
to you my dear"

586
01:35:47,522 --> 01:35:52,119
"Every sacrifice I shall
offer for you, my dear"

587
01:35:55,296 --> 01:36:03,067
"Without you, my love,
life is but not life"

588
01:37:08,469 --> 01:37:09,459
Get up!

589
01:37:15,476 --> 01:37:18,741
Both of you seem to be
heated up with "love".

590
01:37:19,213 --> 01:37:23,548
I think I'll help
you to cool off.

591
01:37:25,186 --> 01:37:29,089
- Tie him up.
- Move it!

592
01:37:36,264 --> 01:37:42,431
If you want to see Shiva alive,
you must submit to my desires.

593
01:37:42,603 --> 01:37:45,766
- No! That can never be,
- Can that never be...!

594
01:37:46,207 --> 01:37:49,438
Well then, you can
watch him die...

595
01:37:50,178 --> 01:37:52,647
...while you consider what's
more important for you...

596
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:55,112
...your honor, or Shiva.

597
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,389
Beat him up.

598
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:18,569
For God's sake,
please let him go.

599
01:38:19,307 --> 01:38:23,073
Watch the show.

600
01:38:28,483 --> 01:38:30,645
Must you put him through
such torture, Chand?

601
01:38:31,185 --> 01:38:32,744
Come. Come to me.

602
01:38:33,421 --> 01:38:34,752
No! Chand! Don't.

603
01:38:35,156 --> 01:38:37,090
Tie up his legs.

604
01:38:56,777 --> 01:39:00,372
No! Chand! Don't.

605
01:41:09,777 --> 01:41:14,613
- Let him go, Shiva.
- He has insulted your honor.

606
01:41:15,282 --> 01:41:18,115
I won't spare his life.
I won't!

607
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:22,119
If he dies, you'll have
to go to the gallows.

608
01:41:22,456 --> 01:41:26,120
I can't live without you.
I can't live without you, Shiva!

609
01:45:34,651 --> 01:45:43,184
"Even if the rivers stop flowing,
we shall never stop"

610
01:45:49,666 --> 01:45:58,302
"Even if the blue skies bend down,
we shall never bend"

611
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:14,147
"We'll break every tradition
for fulfilling the vow of love"

612
01:47:21,558 --> 01:47:26,155
"Love is the temple;
Love is the worship"

613
01:47:26,396 --> 01:47:30,492
"Love is God"

614
01:47:36,673 --> 01:47:45,514
"People may live in houses;
We live in the hearts"

615
01:47:52,122 --> 01:48:01,122
"When love touches the hearts,
we cannot be separated"

616
01:49:01,791 --> 01:49:08,128
You have bitten me so many times
that even my blood is poisoned.

617
01:49:09,599 --> 01:49:20,135
But now, I'll strike you. So you
can neither live, nor die.

618
01:50:27,143 --> 01:50:31,637
Where is Ranbir?

619
01:50:38,254 --> 01:50:40,552
I am RanbirSingh.

620
01:50:49,165 --> 01:50:51,634
Father! Why did you do this?!

621
01:50:53,569 --> 01:50:55,560
You are at fault, my son.

622
01:50:56,606 --> 01:51:00,099
You shouldn't have infringed
upon anyone's honor.

623
01:51:02,578 --> 01:51:04,569
This girl had shot my horse!

624
01:51:05,181 --> 01:51:09,584
For only that?
You should be ashamed.

625
01:51:10,887 --> 01:51:16,587
Do you not know, that honor is
more precious than a horse?

626
01:51:22,231 --> 01:51:27,465
Here, take my head-dress
(mark of honor)

627
01:51:28,805 --> 01:51:31,638
...and lay it at the feet
of Chowdhary Sarang.

628
01:51:32,508 --> 01:51:39,141
- No, that I shall never do.
- What! If you don't comply...

629
01:51:40,616 --> 01:51:42,607
...I shall cut your head off,
and lay it at his feet!

630
01:52:02,338 --> 01:52:08,573
If you are still not calmed
Chowdhary, then you may shoot him!

631
01:52:11,514 --> 01:52:14,245
I shall forgive you
for killing my son.

632
01:52:16,419 --> 01:52:24,657
I want to atone for the dishonour
that my son brought upon you, too.

633
01:52:26,763 --> 01:52:31,200
I want your daughter as
my daughter-in-law.

634
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:36,864
Please accept this proposal.

635
01:52:37,673 --> 01:52:41,667
There are some sins that
man cannot be absolved of.

636
01:52:42,378 --> 01:52:44,369
And punishment is a must
for such crimes.

637
01:52:45,748 --> 01:52:49,309
If that be so,
dictate your penalty.

638
01:52:50,686 --> 01:52:53,553
But remember, that there isn't
much of a difference...

639
01:52:53,689 --> 01:52:55,680
...between a bowed head
and a severed head.

640
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:04,665
Remember too, I've preserved your
honor as I would preserve mine.

641
01:53:21,884 --> 01:53:26,845
I accept your proposal, Hari Singh.

642
01:53:29,225 --> 01:53:32,195
On the first day of the
forthcoming marriage season...

643
01:53:32,395 --> 01:53:34,386
...you may come over with
Ranbir for the marriage.

644
01:53:37,633 --> 01:53:39,624
Why did you arranged my marriage?

645
01:53:40,236 --> 01:53:43,536
But first, you must tell me about
the dress you are wearing.

646
01:53:44,207 --> 01:53:47,199
What's wrong with that?
She's wearing a Saree!

647
01:53:47,477 --> 01:53:51,812
No! This is not a saree.
This is merely a colorful coffin...

648
01:53:52,148 --> 01:53:55,482
...containing the remains
of the upbringing...

649
01:53:55,618 --> 01:53:57,643
...that I've so painstakingly
given her over the last 18 years.

650
01:54:01,157 --> 01:54:07,494
When I saw you in these clothes,
I did not see my son Chand...

651
01:54:08,164 --> 01:54:10,155
...I saw in you a Chand,
who is but a corpse.

652
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:14,827
And lthought I wouldn't keep a
rotting carcass. It starts stinking!

653
01:54:15,771 --> 01:54:20,333
So I decided to get
the corpse married.

654
01:54:20,643 --> 01:54:23,840
What father would call
his daughter a corpse!

655
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:28,845
What a mother you are! After
18 years you've got back...

656
01:54:29,185 --> 01:54:31,677
...your long-lost daughter!
Your daughter!

657
01:54:33,189 --> 01:54:36,853
And you keep standing!
Go, and hug your daughter!

658
01:54:37,326 --> 01:54:39,317
Dress her up in trinklets!

659
01:54:40,630 --> 01:54:43,793
And coloured dots on the forehead
that I used to anoint ritually!

660
01:54:45,868 --> 01:54:48,132
And get her decked
like a doll

661
01:54:48,471 --> 01:54:51,634
for in 7 days, a husband
comes to take her away

662
01:54:53,376 --> 01:54:56,141
Father!
I don'! want this marriage!

663
01:55:02,652 --> 01:55:06,816
My decisions cannot
change like your dress.

664
01:55:07,924 --> 01:55:12,623
- I have promised Hari Singh.
- I've given my heart to someone.

665
01:55:21,337 --> 01:55:29,836
You, my daughter have said
in public, that which my own...

666
01:55:30,246 --> 01:55:36,674
mslster could not tell me,
20 years ago!

667
01:55:38,387 --> 01:55:43,188
I have loved you so! And you've
turned out to be so shameless!

668
01:55:43,659 --> 01:55:48,119
How is she to fault? You haven't
even taught her these etiquettes!

669
01:55:49,565 --> 01:55:55,129
How would she know?
You've schooled her like this.

670
01:55:55,471 --> 01:55:58,133
But don't expect the father
to emulate the child.

671
01:56:01,344 --> 01:56:05,747
Just remember one thing, Chand!
You mustn't take any wrong steps...

672
01:56:05,881 --> 01:56:10,648
...as my sister did!
As you know well

673
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:23,165
people fleeing my estate, die!
- So is also true of lovers; Father!

674
01:56:29,171 --> 01:56:33,836
Clap your hands now. You'll beat
your breasts when you see the result.

675
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:38,178
And you will be in agony
when you get to hear

676
01:56:38,314 --> 01:56:41,181
...who it is that
Chand is in love with.

677
01:56:47,123 --> 01:56:52,118
Who ls It? Tell me,
who ls It?

678
01:56:53,462 --> 01:56:57,524
You can'! get a word out of Chanel.
She won'! say a thlng.

679
01:56:59,335 --> 01:57:02,635
She is your child, after all.

680
01:57:04,340 --> 01:57:08,277
But, never mind.
I know who it is.

681
01:57:09,745 --> 01:57:12,806
You have lost, Sarang.

682
01:57:13,849 --> 01:57:15,817
Never!
Never can Sarang lose!

683
01:57:16,252 --> 01:57:18,619
Did you expect
love to lose out?

684
01:57:18,888 --> 01:57:19,821
Sarang defeats and destroys
anyone whom he hates!

685
01:57:23,325 --> 01:57:24,315
Nonsense!

686
01:58:00,362 --> 01:58:05,129
"Accept what I say;
Accept your defeat"

687
01:58:05,901 --> 01:58:10,600
"Never has nor can love be
wiped out from this world"

688
01:58:47,777 --> 01:58:53,113
"How many helpless people
like me, have you destroyed"

689
01:59:01,590 --> 01:59:07,120
"One of these days, you will
receive a shroud for your coffin"

690
01:59:15,638 --> 01:59:20,132
"Your reign of terror
is going to be destroyed"

691
02:00:15,664 --> 02:00:21,125
"Someone is about to rebel"

692
02:00:29,645 --> 02:00:35,140
"He that challenges you
is the shadow of your death"

693
02:00:43,559 --> 02:00:48,429
"Enemy of love you are;
Be prepared to accept defeat"

694
02:01:00,109 --> 02:01:02,601
Stop it!
Enough of these dramatics!

695
02:01:03,779 --> 02:01:07,443
- Tell me his name! Or else
- Shoot yourself if you must.

696
02:01:08,317 --> 02:01:14,450
Your greatest defeat
is before Ganga.

697
02:01:15,824 --> 02:01:18,452
You don't seem to
understand, do you?

698
02:01:19,194 --> 02:01:26,294
Listen to this; She's in love
with Ganga's son, Shiva.

699
02:01:28,270 --> 02:01:37,145
No!
You're her father, after all!

700
02:01:37,413 --> 02:01:39,677
More than just her father,
lam Chowdhary Sarang.

701
02:01:40,382 --> 02:01:42,373
- Get out of my way!
- Sarang!

702
02:01:44,253 --> 02:01:48,486
- Don't you ever dare shoot her!
- Who are you to interfere?

703
02:01:48,757 --> 02:01:50,748
She is my daughter-in-law to be.

704
02:01:52,528 --> 02:01:54,656
- A Goddess in my family
- Ganga!

705
02:01:55,230 --> 02:02:01,169
D'you remember Sarang, that
we stood here 20 years ago...

706
02:02:01,603 --> 02:02:05,836
...and we'd made promises to
each other. Do you remember, Sarang?

707
02:02:07,743 --> 02:02:19,178
You must remember them. But, I
think, You're basically scared of my son.

708
02:02:20,723 --> 02:02:28,392
You haven't courage enough to face
him. Which is because you don't want...

709
02:02:28,564 --> 02:02:33,866
...that my son comes here to wed
your daughter. You'd lose face then.

710
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:37,867
And that is exactly why you want
to sacrifice your daughter.

711
02:02:38,273 --> 02:02:42,210
<i>- Gang-a'.
- Remember Sarang, that she...</i>

712
02:02:44,546 --> 02:02:50,144
...is mine, kept with you in trust.
If you do not send her away...

713
02:02:50,319 --> 02:02:54,688
...with your blessings,
I'll snatch her away from you!

714
02:02:55,724 --> 02:02:56,714
Ganga!

715
02:03:02,765 --> 02:03:08,670
It's good for the sinner to chant the
name of Ganga (a holy Hindu river).

716
02:03:10,406 --> 02:03:15,344
It helps lessen the
burden of sins.

717
02:03:15,677 --> 02:03:21,172
I've never sinned. On the other
hand, I've punished sinners.

718
02:03:22,785 --> 02:03:27,518
Had I not promised that I'd
spare you, you wouldn't

719
02:03:27,723 --> 02:03:32,524
...have gone away alive, today.
Make sure you bring your

720
02:03:32,694 --> 02:03:34,685
...son along with you, the next time
that you come over here.

721
02:03:35,464 --> 02:03:40,368
So that I can fulfill the promise
made to you 20 years ago.

722
02:03:45,707 --> 02:03:52,135


723
02:04:37,426 --> 02:04:40,691
Prepare for her marriage, Shanti.
- Where are you going, Shiva?

724
02:04:41,663 --> 02:04:44,530
- To Chowdhary Sarangfs villa.
- Why?

725
02:04:45,434 --> 02:04:48,460
- He wants to get his daughter...
- married off to Ranbir Singh.

726
02:04:49,238 --> 02:04:51,297
- I know.
But there isn't any need for

727
02:04:53,142 --> 02:04:56,476
you to go over there.
Wait for the right opportunity.

728
02:05:06,488 --> 02:05:10,482
Everything will be alright.
Stop it! No bride is going

729
02:05:11,193 --> 02:05:14,652
to come to this house.
No bride for you to welcome.

730
02:05:18,901 --> 02:05:21,495
I'm going to get a maidservant
for this house.

731
02:05:22,204 --> 02:05:27,574
And anyone who even sympathises
with her, will be shot. Understand?

732
02:05:29,378 --> 02:05:34,839
She'll be a servant for my servants.
Remember that.

733
02:06:11,653 --> 02:06:17,490
"Those do not weep...

734
02:06:17,926 --> 02:06:22,488
whose tears have dried up"

735
02:06:37,846 --> 02:06:43,842
"It is true folks, that this...

736
02:06:44,253 --> 02:06:48,281
is a world of heartless people"

737
02:07:09,811 --> 02:07:15,682
"Tired is the heart
of trying to plead"

738
02:07:29,564 --> 02:07:35,503
"lam weeping,
thinking of you"

739
02:08:59,621 --> 02:09:09,121
"Strange traditions
in a vile world"

740
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:24,477
"Of taking pleasure
out of destruction"

741
02:10:12,828 --> 02:10:18,460
"We shall fight till
our breath lasts"

742
02:10:19,234 --> 02:10:24,638
"We'll change the course
of the storm of oppression"

743
02:10:51,099 --> 02:10:56,435
"I shall set you free"

744
02:11:34,209 --> 02:11:39,648
- I won't go back, Shiva.
- Neither will I let you go.

745
02:11:45,687 --> 02:11:49,146
Mothermthis is Chand.

746
02:11:54,629 --> 02:11:56,620
She has left her house.

747
02:12:00,268 --> 02:12:06,366
You haven't done the right thing,
my dear. Escort her home, Shiva.

748
02:12:10,278 --> 02:12:15,512
- Send her back, Shiva.
- I won't let her go back.

749
02:12:28,296 --> 02:12:35,362
D'you remember you'd once said
that the clay, even after...

750
02:12:35,537 --> 02:12:39,201
...it has been put through fire,
says nothing to the potter?

751
02:12:40,308 --> 02:12:44,370
But you have chosen to
ignore me altogether!

752
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:50,149
In a moment, you've snatched
away the right of decision...

753
02:12:50,885 --> 02:12:55,823
...that I've enjoyed over you
for the past 20 years.

754
02:12:57,258 --> 02:13:01,820
No mother! If you want so, I'll
give up every drop of my blood...

755
02:13:02,230 --> 02:13:08,829
...without as much as a murmur. But,
I can't let Chand go back. I can't!

756
02:13:09,237 --> 02:13:11,831
Then take her away by night.
so that people can say...

757
02:13:12,173 --> 02:13:16,167
...that you've eloped with her.

758
02:13:18,313 --> 02:13:25,686
Lovers can face the whole world.
But you want to run away.

759
02:13:26,254 --> 02:13:32,193
Well, run away, then. And I
won't have any regrets either

760
02:13:34,362 --> 02:13:45,535
It I have anything to regret, it's
that I escaped Sarang's bullets.

761
02:13:50,145 --> 02:13:56,812
Neither would I have lived.
Nor would I have sworn.

762
02:13:57,385 --> 02:14:02,824
- What have you sworn, Mother?
- You won't be able to appreciate...

763
02:14:03,224 --> 02:14:09,652
...my promise, till I give
you the body count of the dead.

764
02:14:22,577 --> 02:14:26,172
Please forgive me, mother.
Please forgive me.

765
02:14:39,527 --> 02:14:46,365
I swear to behead Chowdhary
Sarang and lay his head at your feet.

766
02:14:46,701 --> 02:14:52,140
I don't want that.
This is not a vendetta.

767
02:14:53,174 --> 02:14:56,474
This is a war between
love and hatred.

768
02:14:57,679 --> 02:15:04,813
Hatred takes lives.
Love makes people bow their heads.

769
02:15:06,654 --> 02:15:13,651
I don't want Sarang's head severed.
I want his head bowed.

770
02:16:32,173 --> 02:16:37,509
"Pay now the debt of love;
fulfill your duty as a son"

771
02:16:38,213 --> 02:16:40,511
"Pay back the enemy today"

772
02:16:55,463 --> 02:16:58,125
"He has been unjust to us"

773
02:16:58,366 --> 02:17:00,460
"You must now be unjust with him"

774
02:17:01,135 --> 02:17:08,132
"Which is why your Mother
has named you Shivam"

775
02:17:57,158 --> 02:17:58,148
Surround him!

776
02:18:23,151 --> 02:18:31,650
Listen to me, Sarang. Accept
defeat from Shiva and Chand.

777
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:40,159
I have never, and will never
bow my head before anyone.

778
02:18:40,635 --> 02:18:43,627
Today, you must,
Chowdhary Sarang.

779
02:18:45,606 --> 02:18:47,540
If you bow your head out of love,
I shall touoh your feet.

780
02:18:49,143 --> 02:18:51,134
Else, you're going
to be destroyed!

781
02:18:57,518 --> 02:19:01,113
I had once begged to
have your daughter.

782
02:19:02,123 --> 02:19:09,291
After getting to know about this
love between Shiva and Chand...

783
02:19:09,564 --> 02:19:16,630
...I shall beg of you again, to have
your daughter married to Shiva.

784
02:19:16,804 --> 02:19:20,297
Ho, Father!
I shall not let that happen.

785
02:19:22,477 --> 02:19:29,144
Chand and Shiva love each other.
And Shiva has a right over her.

786
02:19:30,351 --> 02:19:32,615
- Take the marriage procession
back. - This procession won't go back!

787
02:19:34,622 --> 02:19:36,818
You're forgetting that
we're Thurs (by caste).

788
02:19:37,325 --> 02:19:40,158
And our marriage processions
don't return without a bride.

789
02:19:40,528 --> 02:19:43,225
Don't insist, my son.
Come, let's go.

790
02:19:43,598 --> 02:19:47,432
Ho.
I won't go back without my bride.

791
02:19:48,770 --> 02:19:58,612
So be it! The marriage procession
won't return without a bride.

792
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:08,452
I'm now pan of the marriage
procession of your son.

793
02:20:27,809 --> 02:20:33,475
You've conveyed your decision
to your son, Hari Singh.

794
02:20:34,482 --> 02:20:36,143
Now listen to my decision.

795
02:20:37,552 --> 02:20:45,152
My daughter will go to your
household as a bride, if at all.

796
02:20:46,594 --> 02:20:48,426
It is a matter of my honor.

797
02:20:56,304 --> 02:21:01,435
If you think you've been brought
to dishonour me...

798
02:21:02,343 --> 02:21:04,107
...then shoot me!

799
02:21:06,781 --> 02:21:12,117
Neither will I have to live nor
will you face dishonour for me.

800
02:21:17,558 --> 02:21:23,463
A daughter's ready to sacrifice her
life and love for her father's honor.

801
02:21:24,198 --> 02:21:28,135
Has a father no duty
towards his daughter?

802
02:21:29,637 --> 02:21:35,132
You have destroyed countless
happy and loving families.

803
02:21:37,245 --> 02:21:41,148
As a father, at least, let
your daughter live a happy life.

804
02:21:42,316 --> 02:21:47,811
For once, please do as a
father would. Just for once!

805
02:21:54,362 --> 02:21:55,352
Get back!

806
02:21:56,230 --> 02:22:00,167
You have nothing more to
do or undo, Sarang.

807
02:22:00,635 --> 02:22:04,503
You had arranged my marriage to
Chand. I'll get married to her!

808
02:22:04,939 --> 02:22:09,172
I'm going away with Chand.
If anyone dares...

809
02:22:09,610 --> 02:22:11,601
...let hlm take
Chanel away from me.

810
02:23:44,205 --> 02:23:47,140
Please forgive him.

811
02:24:55,209 --> 02:25:01,672
Who fired the shot? Was it the
Chowdhary or was it the father?

812
02:25:12,193 --> 02:25:16,221
The father now orders, that
the marriage be solemnised.

813
02:26:27,501 --> 02:26:29,492
Give this nose-ring to Chand.

814
02:26:45,853 --> 02:26:48,117
Go now and take his blessings.

815
02:27:35,703 --> 02:27:45,909
A father may have lost out, Ganga!
But Chowdhary Sarang hasn't lost!
