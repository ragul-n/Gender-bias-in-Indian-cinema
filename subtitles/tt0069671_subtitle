1
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,047
Hold your breath!

2
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,145
Now in front of
this wonderful crowd...

3
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:39,758
... the melodious voice which has
enthralled the heart of millions...

4
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,930
... the voice you've been
waiting to hear...

5
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,859
... with that
majestic voice comes...

6
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:48,759
... a great artist of our country.

7
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:54,201
The greatest singer of our country.
Subir Kumar!

8
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,108
Yes of course, l know
who's on the line.

9
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:26,105
Will l've to use your
name to convince you?

10
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,315
A bright star in the sky, Chitra.

11
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:35,450
- What were you doing?
- Nothing, l was just sitting.

12
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:41,188
Don't you've the courtesy to
stand up in front of a lady?

13
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,993
l am not in front of a lady,
l'm just hearing her voice.

14
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:50,428
So tell me, how did
the singing go today?

15
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,195
lt went very well.

16
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,533
lt was a sad song.
lt was a song about separation.

17
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,905
Separation, that's the
real tune of life itself.

18
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:02,582
Oh! So you like such songs.

19
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:08,420
Can l enquire as to who's
behind this separation?

20
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:13,121
l've kept that name in
a safe deposit vault.

21
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,190
So, what else did
you do today?

22
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:21,297
l helped a four year old dog
and a sixty year old man.

23
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:24,831
l saved them from
being hit by the car.

24
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,165
What else?

25
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:30,673
Then... l attended the silver
jubilee function of a movie.

26
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,376
What next?

27
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,838
Then l lambasted a photographer.

28
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,642
Lambasted! Why?

29
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,945
The swine, flashed his camera
right in front of my eyes.

30
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,594
Go to sleep now, but meet
me tomorrow definitely.

31
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,458
- Listen.
- Yes.

32
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:59,068
One last thing.
l'm crazy about your music.

33
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,505
ls that so?
Only about my music?

34
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:08,181
You make my life
worth living.

35
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:18,222
This is submitted to the
income-tax authorities. Sign it.

36
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:27,226
What were you talking about
for so long with Chitra?

37
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:32,128
We were discussing how to
start the third world war!

38
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,967
Yes! Do l have to
tell you everything?

39
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,310
No! You don't need
to tell me anything.

40
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:44,814
You may do whatever suits you.
Understood! Whatever suits you.

41
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,419
Why do you envy
her so much?

42
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,450
- A friend!
- Yes.

43
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:54,258
What friendship can a man and
woman share? lt's just like..

44
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:58,090
... a dagger and a melon,
or an eagle and a pigeon, right?

45
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:03,269
Yes. But the point here is that
she's the eagle and you, the pigeon.

46
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,438
- Shut up.
- No.

47
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,869
l've only one desire, that you
become the greatest singer of lndia.

48
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:17,110
But for that you've to be dedicated,
hardworking and disciplined.

49
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:21,111
l see you getting slowly
infatuated by Chitra.

50
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:24,483
- And she's not at all fit for you.
- What do you mean?

51
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:27,855
Look here... You know
that you can't marry her.

52
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:31,587
Why advance the relationship any
further? l don't think it's right.

53
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,666
And you said that an
ideal wife for you...

54
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:38,798
... would be someone
like your mother and aunt.

55
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,572
Someone who could take
care of you, serve you.

56
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:46,706
Mark my words, this rich
and independent female...

57
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,678
... will make you
dance like a puppet.

58
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:55,517
You are laughing when you should
be crying. Laugh as much as you
want to.

59
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:58,487
A day will come when
you'll have to cry.

60
00:10:58,692 --> 00:10:59,750
Give that to me!

61
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:07,029
- Good night DAD!
- Good night son.

62
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,085
Listen, can l speak
to Subir Kumar?

63
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,638
Hello, whom do you want?

64
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,779
- You.
- Who's that you?

65
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,415
You, Subir Kumar.

66
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,315
Look here, l ain't Subir Kumar.
My name is Vishnu.

67
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,286
What rubbish! Your voice
is one amongst millions.

68
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,919
lt cannot belong to any
Shiv, Mahesh or Vishnu.

69
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,892
What troubles you so
late in the night?

70
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:21,566
l'll tell you that if you meet me.
Did you not recognise me?

71
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:26,069
- No.
- We met at the Haridas Convention.

72
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,707
My name is Radha.

73
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:34,380
Wow! A very classical name indeed.
But what do you want?

74
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:37,414
Me... l want to meet you.

75
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:39,946
But why?

76
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,819
l am in love with you, my darling.

77
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,421
Since l've heard you...

78
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,422
Go to hell!

79
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,771
Who's that?

80
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:13,843
- What happened?
- Nothing... Were you sleeping?

81
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:20,316
Do you expect me to be
fishing in bed at midnight?

82
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,986
You're finding it
difficult to sleep, right?

83
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,252
- Yes.
- lt happens.

84
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,598
Once you become
famous, it happens.

85
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,961
Go, try and get some sleep.

86
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,913
When will our new
bungalow get ready?

87
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,382
ln another two or three months.

88
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:06,432
We are quite fine here.
What'll we do in such a big
bungalow?

89
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:11,471
Do one thing. Sell it off
as soon as it is ready.

90
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:16,001
Why? What's the problem?

91
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:20,977
You look lonely, unhappy
and depressed again today.

92
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,717
- This will definitely happen.
- Why?

93
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:32,258
You know God, up in heaven,
he has a weird sense of humour.

94
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,654
He balances everything
proportionately.

95
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:40,230
He asked his secretary once, what
was given to a particular fellow?

96
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:44,427
The secretary told him that he
has been given Rupees 6 to 7
lakhs

97
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:48,570
The Lord said, ''Give him
an ulcer, gastric''...

98
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,437
...''and a boil in his
stomach so that he can't eat''.

99
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:54,409
Then he asked what
another fellow was given?

100
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:58,710
The secretary replied that he had
been given some land and a cloth
mill

101
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:03,048
The Lord said ''Give him
a crooked manager''

102
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,747
''And also make him start gambling''

103
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,989
Then he asked what
was given to you.

104
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:16,328
Me? A bit of fame,
a little bit of money.

105
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:20,161
-How much money?
-Around two or three lakhs of
rupees.

106
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,308
- What about the
one lakh black money?

107
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,067
- May be that too.

108
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:28,209
Then do one thing. Make him
restless for now, then we will see.

109
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,046
- That's a nice joke.
- You liked it, right?

110
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,847
So now, get up and
please go to sleep.

111
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,183
The same thing again.
l told you l can't sleep.

112
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:41,623
Where have you hid the bottle of
sleeping tablets? Give it to me.

113
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,659
Oh! You attended 4 or 5
parties.

114
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,229
Had a few drinks there.

115
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,798
And now you want sleeping tablets
so that you may sleep forever.

116
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:50,265
And the cops arrest me.
Very good!

117
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,495
Look here, do one thing.

118
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:56,969
Find a nice and good-looking
girl and get married.

119
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,145
Yes. Thus when you can't sleep...

120
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:02,907
... wake her up at midnight and
play* rummy with her for 1
rupee per point

121
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,186
You rascal.

122
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,891
Can l speak to Subir?

123
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,025
Yes, What can l do for you?

124
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:03,370
- How long have you been here?
- For quite some time now?

125
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:07,035
And l saw with my own eyes
how l was being dishonoured.

126
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,943
You were listening
to my song and dozing.

127
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:16,418
Not at all sir. l was taking your
heavenly music right into my soul.

128
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:18,785
WOW!

129
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,292
When a woman is sitting
with her eyes shut...

130
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,426
... don't make the mistake of
thinking that she's sleeping.

131
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,293
- ls that so?
- Yes.

132
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:38,405
- What brings you here at this time?
- l was just passing by...

133
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,671
... so l dropped in to say hello.*
l've a song recording.

134
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:44,214
After half an hour.
- Half an hour!

135
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,648
Where's Dad nowadays?

136
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,585
He's a busy man.

137
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:54,961
A conference in Geneva today,
Bonn tomorrow, the day after...

138
00:19:55,161 --> 00:20:01,498
.. get some whisky... listen, get it
with cold water: we don't need
soda.

139
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,705
Chitra, l told you
there's a recording.

140
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,575
So what! Your voice will
become more intoxicating.

141
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:12,710
That's fine. But you
know that chap, my Dad!

142
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:14,471
- Who's that, Chandru?
- Yes.

143
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:17,616
lf he finds out that l came to sing
after having a drink then l've had
it

144
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,919
Yes, Chandru here.

145
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:24,783
No, this month there's no date.

146
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,190
Yes tomorrow is free,
but l've a bad throat sir.

147
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,128
Yes, if it's cancelled*
again l'll let you know.

148
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:36,462
Okay, bye.

149
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:39,605
Did you see that?
There are many problems.

150
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,003
- We have come with great hope.
- But what can l do?

151
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,473
But you have to do something.
lt's for some charity.

152
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,510
l understand that sir.

153
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:51,173
How're you? Did you
get Dharmendra's date?

154
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:55,519
That l have. But if l don't get
Subir's date, l'll be ruined.

155
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,847
Look l've got everything.
- Wait, l'd like to speak to you.

156
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:02,790
Please wait, l'll be back soon.
Vishnu! Get some tea for them.

157
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,530
- Does he sing too?
- No.

158
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:11,368
But he just said that
he had a bad throat.

159
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:14,367
lt means that Subir Kumar
has a bad throat.

160
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:18,839
Secretaries say such things.
ln popular lingo that's a stooge.

161
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,510
Come Mr. Rao.
Take a seat.

162
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:28,849
lt's just that, lt's not proper to
open your bag in front of everybody.

163
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:31,717
Can't say if somebody is from
the income-tax department.

164
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:34,291
Do you know that the
income-tax department has...

165
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,226
... put six inspectors
for the film section?

166
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,954
- ls it?
- Yes.

167
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:42,301
This is your cheque for
Rupees 2000.

168
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,367
And this is the hot-cash.

169
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,941
Chandruji, l hope
my dates are fixed.

170
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,110
Yes, you've made the payment...

171
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:54,610
... so they won't be cancelled.
Absolutely irrevocable.

172
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,660
Are you signing photographs?

173
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:15,025
Sign all of them.
There's quite a lot of fan-mail.*

174
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:18,693
Here's the six thousand which
Mr.Rao has given. Count it.

175
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:22,775
- l'll break your teeth.
- Why? Does it not hurt?

176
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:25,543
Don't l feel hurt when you
ask me to count the cash?

177
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,337
No, l did not mean that.

178
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,811
lt's money after all.
So you should count it.

179
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,985
l won't do it. All this
accounting is your problem.

180
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:38,418
Listen... Keep this
money for yourself.

181
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:42,384
- Myself! Why?
- Stupid question. For expenses.

182
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:47,228
You've said it once,
don't say it ever again.

183
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:51,362
l work here because of my affection
for you. Do you mind that?

184
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:56,372
At times l feel like beating you
up and making you stand in a
corner.

185
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:02,344
There are some people here from
Bangalore, l've to get rid of them.

186
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,210
Yes, go ahead.

187
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:10,922
l've checked the dates,
there's no chance.

188
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:14,520
Look, we are ready to pay
as much as you ask for.

189
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:19,722
That's the limit! ls he an actor
who signs any film because of
money?

190
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:28,569
But please give him this letter.

191
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:31,936
- Whose letter is that?
- lt's meant for him.

192
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:35,980
Whatever he says after reading
this is acceptable to us.

193
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:43,320
These people from Bangalore
have got a letter from someone.

194
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,514
- Whose letter is it?
- l don't know.

195
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:46,659
Read it.

196
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:52,494
'My dear son, Beeru'

197
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,295
Who has written it?

198
00:23:55,735 --> 00:24:00,297
'Wishing for your well-being with
every breath, Yours, Aunt Durga'

199
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:03,436
- Your Aunt!
- Yes.

200
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,676
She may be my Aunt, but she
means more to me than a mother.

201
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,145
After the death of my parents,
when l was just one, she raised me.

202
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:14,985
- She has sent a reference.
- ls it? Then you have to go.

203
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:19,249
But, how's that possible?
The schedule is so tight.

204
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,622
To hell with the schedule.
l'll cancel everything.

205
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,593
But what about the dates
fixed for the month?

206
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:29,132
Damn the dates! l'll get the
brickbats. No problem, l'll handle
it.

207
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,566
Come and meet them.

208
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,835
- Greetings.
- Greetings, please have a seat.

209
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,236
Why did you not tell me before
that Aunty has sent you?

210
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,604
That was the one ace we held.

211
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,072
- But l have one condition.
- What's that?

212
00:24:42,282 --> 00:24:45,945
- l'll surely go to meet my Aunt.
- Definitely, l'll have a car ready.

213
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:49,280
But l've to be back in Bombay
the next day at 1 0 in the morning

214
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:52,220
Yes, you may leave as soon
as the function is over.

215
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:21,448
- Where's Aunt Durga?
- Upstairs.

216
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,767
- What's going on here?!
- Oh my God!

217
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,738
Oh Beeru, it's you!

218
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,146
Wait... Let me have
a good look at you.

219
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:57,448
You've had a good look and your
eyes are filled with tears too.

220
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,855
You aren't yet old enough to
understand the joy of shedding
tears.

221
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:07,288
l thought, perhaps l wouldn't
get to see you till l die.

222
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,027
What are you talking about?
You have yet to see my marriage.

223
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,570
That is l'll have to live
for another hundred years.

224
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:18,141
l'm very hungry. Tell me, what're
you going to cook for dinner.

225
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:26,576
Cook! Brinjals... Cucumber Rolls
and thick bread made of gram flour.

226
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:31,649
You still remember
my likes and dislikes.

227
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,849
l'm not like you.

228
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:37,060
Come on, freshen up
and rest awhile.

229
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,790
lt's quite peaceful here.
The city is very suffocating.

230
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,195
l'd rather go for a stroll.

231
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:46,634
And my food should be
ready by the time l return.

232
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:54,737
- Mother, who was he?
- That's my Beeru.

233
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:58,810
Did you see how he orders
me around? As if l'm his mother.

234
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:51,770
You're back.
This is what you call soon.

235
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,804
- Listen, you know the temple?
- Yes.

236
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:58,942
l heard someone worshiping
the Lord... singing a madrigal.

237
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:03,411
lt felt heavenly. l've never felt
such happiness and peace before.

238
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:09,849
You must've heard brother Sadanand
and her daughter singing.

239
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:13,081
Yes. He was a teacher in
some school in the city.

240
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,487
He settled down
here four years ago.

241
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,959
There are very few
saints like him.

242
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,724
l don't know much about it,
but people say that...

243
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,595
... he's a pundit
of classical music.

244
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:26,232
And he has trained
his daughter too.

245
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:28,874
Come with me tomorrow to meet
him.

246
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:32,636
Tomorrow! But l'm leaving
tomorrow morning.

247
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,472
- Tomorrow itself?
- Yes.

248
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,012
lf you wanted to leave so soon,
then why did you come at all?

249
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,344
What can l do? l've to do
a lot of work in the city.

250
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,386
You've come after eight years
and that too for only a day.

251
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,147
- Aunty!
- Don't aunty me.

252
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,053
But where are you going?

253
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,592
To the kitchen,
the food is getting cold.

254
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,834
Aunty, l'm getting late.

255
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:42,204
Let it be, God knows whether l'll
live long enough to see you again.

256
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:45,350
- Don't spoil my mood.
- And what about me?

257
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:50,587
Remember me sometimes atleast.
Who else do l have other than you?

258
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,119
l'll come back and
stay here for many days.

259
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:55,658
- Really?
- Yes.

260
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:58,092
- Swear by me.
- Here you are.

261
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,532
Okay, l'd better hurry
or l'll miss the flight.

262
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:12,307
Visit the temple
on the way back.

263
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:25,459
Wow! You sing very well indeed.

264
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:28,930
Excuse me.

265
00:34:30,336 --> 00:34:33,362
Aren't you Miss Uma?
Mr.Sadanand's daughter?

266
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,233
How do you know that?

267
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:39,605
l heard you and your father
singing yesterday. l liked it a lot.

268
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:42,940
l asked my aunt about it
and she told me about you.

269
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:47,279
- Does your aunt stay here?
- Yes, near that old banyan tree.

270
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,948
- But that house belongs to
grandma.
- Grandma!

271
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:57,189
- Do you call aunt Durga, grandma?
- Yes.

272
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:01,858
- Aren't you Mr.Subir?
- Yes l am.

273
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:05,060
Grandma always talks about you.

274
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:09,640
And whenever your song comes on
the radio, she sits right in front of
it.

275
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:15,675
l too have heard you singing.
You sing very well.

276
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:20,350
But all your songs are not good.
Some of them are just plain noisy.

277
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,079
Which song have you heard?

278
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:30,092
How is that good, or noisy?

279
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:34,763
lt's good. l hope you
didn't feel bad about...

280
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:38,863
No, why should l feel bad
about it? You're right.

281
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:42,629
- Even l don't like some of them.
- Then why do you sing them?

282
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:47,074
What can l do? People like such
songs, and people mean everything.

283
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:50,112
Do you sing to
make people happy?

284
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:53,615
- Then who else should l sing for?
- For yourself.

285
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:58,847
My father says, when a song is sung
for one's own self, it becomes music.

286
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:03,857
That's why your song
sounded so sweet.

287
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:08,626
- Great God!
- What happened?

288
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:11,596
Your song, and talking to you
has made me miss my flight.

289
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:14,739
l wasn't singing for you.
And you came here to talk.

290
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,036
Even then, you'll be held
responsible if l miss my flight.

291
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,151
Come on mother...

292
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:42,800
Change your clothes,
freshen-up and have your food.

293
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:46,403
- l ain't hungry.
- l know, it's because Beeru has left

294
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:49,531
Don't trouble me.
l won't eat.

295
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,109
Alright, then l won't eat too.

296
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:56,938
Yes, l thought you must
be crying, so l returned.

297
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:02,016
- Will you stay for a few days?
- No, only today.

298
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:06,751
Well, l'll prepare some food,
l feel hungry all of a sudden.

299
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:10,122
And then we'll go to
meet brother Sadanand.

300
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,411
Dad, haven't you begun yet.
The mosquitoes are buzzing around.

301
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,280
l'll eat it my child.

302
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:38,285
Our upanishads are a
treasure of knowledge.

303
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,425
You get to learn something
new every time you read it.

304
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,959
Alright, you keep on reading.

305
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,195
Keep on reading.

306
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,634
- What are you doing?
- Go on, read.

307
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:58,599
What's this? You're becoming more
like a child with every passing day.

308
00:37:58,811 --> 00:37:59,971
Welcome sister.

309
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:04,047
Old-age makes man a child and
the daughter becomes like a mother.

310
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,443
Please take a seat.

311
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,282
Greetings.

312
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:11,985
He's my son, Subir.
l told you about him.

313
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:15,417
And he's Mr. Sadanand.
He's like my brother.

314
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,323
- Greetings.
- God bless you.

315
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,861
You are quite famous.
When did you arrive?

316
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:23,523
Yesterday. l tried to make
him stay, but he left today.

317
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:26,000
Do you know why he returned?

318
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:32,542
After boarding the plane he thought
l must be crying so he returned.

319
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,342
He did the right thing.
A man should have compassion.

320
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,580
But were you actually crying?

321
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:44,117
She wasn't just crying,
when l returned.

322
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:48,223
l saw her lying on the bed
without having any food or water.

323
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:52,090
That wasn't because you had left.
Actually l had a headache.

324
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:55,391
And when you saw him,
the headache vanished!

325
00:38:56,335 --> 00:39:00,362
And Beeru, this is Uma.
You heard her sing yesterday.

326
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,235
Oh! Do you sing?

327
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,738
You don't look like
the singing type.

328
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:12,474
You too don't look like the type
to return from a plane because of
her

329
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,351
Let's forget it.
Why involve her in everything?

330
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:18,523
- Aunty, you said something about...
- Yes of course.

331
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:22,218
Son, he's a master of music.

332
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:27,256
Listen to me, stay back for a few
days and learn something from him.

333
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:31,425
What can l teach him? He has
already devoted himself to music.

334
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:34,606
And is treading the path
of peace and happiness.

335
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:38,004
Nature has in it's
store, music everywhere.

336
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:41,644
There's a feel to every word.
Every feeling is beautiful.

337
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:44,782
Beauty contains
sweetness and fragrance.

338
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,146
Everything is an integral
part of this universe.

339
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:58,920
- l didn't understand that.
- What?

340
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:00,996
What your father said.

341
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:06,429
'Every word has a feel, beauty has
sweetness and all that is integral'.

342
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:10,705
l couldn't understand that.
- lt's quite simple actually.*

343
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,975
Wait.

344
00:40:13,946 --> 00:40:16,540
Do you hear something?

345
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:19,476
- The sound of a sparrow.
- Yes.

346
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:30,357
Don't you get a feeling that the
sounds are coming from these
flowers?

347
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,918
Yes. Hello, Mr. Rao.

348
00:40:58,257 --> 00:41:02,694
Sorry, but your recording
will have to be cancelled.

349
00:41:03,362 --> 00:41:06,661
l've received a cable
from Subir, he is sick.

350
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,599
Yes, he'll be back
in four or five days.

351
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:12,635
Do one thing, reschedule the
recording on next Monday.

352
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,136
Don't worry, he'll be here.

353
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:25,377
Listen... l saw you put some water
and bow there that day, why?

354
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:28,185
Lord Shiva resides there.

355
00:41:28,387 --> 00:41:31,982
Do you know the bride and
bridegroom come here to get
married?

356
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:36,252
They don't need a priest.
They get married with God as
witness.

357
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,396
- What does that mean?
- lt means...

358
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:45,035
... Lord Shiva
manifested himself here.

359
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:47,603
You believe in all that.

360
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:51,799
My father says belief
is better than argument.

361
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:56,413
lf you have faith, then
it's God, else just a stone.

362
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,435
Here, take this.

363
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:28,076
Won't you feel unhappy
when l leave tomorrow?

364
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,181
Tomorrow! Will you be
leaving tomorrow itself?

365
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,714
- Yes.
- Why?

366
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:38,085
What do you mean?
Don't l've to work?

367
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:48,256
You didn't answer my question,
won't you feel unhappy when l
leave?

368
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:51,269
Grandma will cry a lot.

369
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:56,568
lt's you l'm talking about, not her.
Won't you feel unhappy?

370
00:42:58,577 --> 00:42:59,908
Tell me.

371
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,945
Why will you feel
unhappy when l leave?

372
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:09,884
l don't know why,
but l'll feel lonely.

373
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:14,315
- Me too.
- The city is so crowded...

374
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:16,961
... You'll be very busy,
why should you feel lonely?

375
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:22,031
You don't know. All of a sudden
in the crowd, l find myself alone.

376
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:26,301
- Why?
- Because you aren't there.

377
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,616
- Beeru.
- Yes aunty.

378
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:48,189
Here, have some tea.

379
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:59,801
l'm worried about you staying
alone over there. Get married now.

380
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:02,306
Me, marry a girl!

381
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:03,934
Of course!

382
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,040
l feel that you'll be very happy.

383
00:44:09,281 --> 00:44:14,309
Has anybody ever been happy after
marriage? Uncle being an exception.

384
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:19,079
As l said, you are quite
similar to your uncle.

385
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:23,224
Look, l've chosen a girl.

386
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:26,459
Great God! You've
already chosen one.

387
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,724
- Yes.
- Who's the lucky girl?

388
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:32,802
- Uma.
- Let me think it over.

389
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:36,603
What's there to think about?

390
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:41,603
l want an answer before you leave.
And it should be a yes.

391
00:44:41,947 --> 00:44:44,973
Yes... l said yes.

392
00:45:03,402 --> 00:45:06,633
Mr. Kapadia you've still not
finished with the Bar.

393
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:09,534
This house belongs to
an artist, not a smuggler.

394
00:45:09,741 --> 00:45:13,336
And listen, l don't like the
furniture of the bedroom at all.

395
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:16,981
The size of the bed is too small.
Will he sleep on it or me?

396
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:19,377
lt's length should be
increased by atleast three feet...

397
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:21,074
... Else his legs won't fit.

398
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:23,914
You should do better with
the rest of the furniture.

399
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:28,149
Stop saying yes, and go get the
measurements. l want to surprise
him.

400
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,488
Sorry my friend, but you
are too late for that.

401
00:45:31,663 --> 00:45:34,655
- When did you arrive and how?
- Just now, by cab.

402
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:38,324
- You did not even inform me.
- l too wanted to surprise you.

403
00:45:38,537 --> 00:45:39,629
You donkey!

404
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:43,940
Welcome. Let me introduce you.

405
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:48,904
He is my boss, that's my good
friend Mr.Chandru Kriplani.

406
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:52,241
- Hello.
- He talks a lot.

407
00:45:52,684 --> 00:45:56,211
And she is... Why don't
you guess who she is?

408
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:04,559
Mrs. Sinha! We met at the
function in Muzafarpur.

409
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:09,525
You've become a bit
thin and a bit short too.

410
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:13,895
She can become thin,
but how can she become short?

411
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:16,097
No she can't... Then?

412
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,237
Look carefully, who can she be?

413
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:24,806
Oh Yes! Miss Advani!

414
00:46:25,717 --> 00:46:28,811
You stood first in the
beauty contest at Simla.

415
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,113
You were the judge there, right?

416
00:46:31,656 --> 00:46:33,647
Haven't l recognised her!

417
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:36,756
How are you?
When did you get married?

418
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:39,726
When did you come to Bombay?
Where's your husband?

419
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:41,796
Here's her husband!

420
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:46,170
Yes... She is Uma.

421
00:46:47,506 --> 00:46:50,805
Anybody there!
Get me a glass of cold water!

422
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:55,339
Don't feel bad. But the day after
the marriage was fixed was
auspicious

423
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,609
What could l do? There wasn't an
auspicious day for the next months

424
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:04,050
l won't consider it to be a
marriage. You'll have to marry
again.

425
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:06,520
- With whom?
- With you of course!

426
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:09,993
ls this a wedding or a joke?
Nobody knows about it.

427
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:14,564
You will have to marry again.
l'll get you married.

428
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:17,892
l'll call everybody.
lt will be a great wedding.

429
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,103
And lt will be followed
by a grand party.

430
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:28,137
What luck! Brijeshwarraiji is here.

431
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,873
Welcome! l hadn't, even in my
dreams, thought that you would
come.

432
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,849
Do you think in your dreams too?
When l dream, l just dream.

433
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,581
Listen, do l seem to be
such an insolent man...

434
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:42,055
... that l wouldn't come after
receiving your invitation?

435
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,522
No, it's not that.

436
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:47,129
You being an exponent of classical
music, and me a mere pop singer.

437
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:50,893
That's fine, but even your
music depends on the seven notes.

438
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:58,669
Meet Uma, my wife.
And he is Brijeshwarrai...

439
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:01,937
... considered to be the*
father of classical music here.

440
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,675
May god bless you.

441
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:09,979
Nowadays the custom of
paying respects is over.

442
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:13,989
But do you realise what you
have done by doing this?

443
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:19,020
You have won me over
with love and devotion.

444
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:24,528
But Subir, you said
something very wrong.

445
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:27,762
- What happened?
- This Pop music, classical music...

446
00:48:27,973 --> 00:48:31,465
l wish to show you that l'm a lover
of music, so you'll have to sing.

447
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:33,871
What are you saying?
There are so many guests.

448
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,309
Don't worry. Nobody
over here shall mind.

449
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,607
Subir,lt's his order,
you'll have to sing.

450
00:48:38,817 --> 00:48:41,513
- Agreed, but there's one thing.
- What's that?

451
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:44,586
- Uma will sing with me too.
- Do you sing too?

452
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:48,122
- She sings very well
- Then both of you begin.

453
00:48:48,493 --> 00:48:53,021
lf you don't sing, l'll leave
without eating or drinking anything.

454
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:58,567
- The old-man has trapped me.
- You'll have to sing.

455
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:04,572
How can the reception of Subir's
wedding be complete without his
song?

456
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,641
Subir Kumar will be
accompanied by his wife Uma.

457
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,219
- Why did you ask me to sing?
- What happened?

458
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:23,758
- ln front of everybody.
- Don't worry, l'm with you.

459
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:27,059
lf you get nervous,
look at me.

460
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:30,800
And l will do this.

461
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,795
- What does that mean?
- lt means...

462
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:37,299
... l gave you a kiss.

463
00:53:06,718 --> 00:53:11,314
Wow! What a voice!
May god bless you my child.

464
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,787
l pray to God that both
of you have a long life.

465
00:53:16,628 --> 00:53:21,395
You've learnt classical music,
that's why you sounded very sweet.

466
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:31,600
Congratulations.

467
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:36,169
No problem Subir.
Whatever you did was correct.

468
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:40,573
l was not fit for the
position which she has taken.

469
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:47,214
What l say is true. l felt some pain
when l heard about your marriage.

470
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:53,287
lt felt like there's nothing
left anymore. l felt very lonely.

471
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:58,265
But after hearing her
sing, l feel very happy.

472
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,064
She's the only one
fit to be your wife.

473
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:10,977
You don't know me. l'm Chitra,
a friend of your husband.

474
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:17,877
l'm sorry, but l've to go for
a meeting. l take your leave now.

475
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:21,024
l obeyed you, now
you have to obey me.

476
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,190
You are elder to us, you can't
go without eating something.

477
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:27,728
- Okay, get a sweet dish.
- l'll get it, Please come.

478
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,729
Did you really like her voice?

479
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:37,072
l liked it very much. She must
have learnt from a good teacher.

480
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:40,642
Yes, she learnt from her father.
l've decided that from now on...

481
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:42,846
... we will sing together.

482
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,380
He better not make such a mistake.

483
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:53,955
- Which mistake sir?
- The mistake of singing together.

484
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:58,094
Don't you understand?
Uma is more talented than Subir.

485
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:02,260
And history teaches us that
a man is superior than a woman.

486
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:05,502
Will he be able to bear
her overtaking him?

487
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:08,035
Don't worry, they are married...

488
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:12,266
... all the music will be lost in
the kitchen and raising children.

489
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:18,411
That'll be even worse.

490
00:55:20,118 --> 00:55:23,884
l must've been around ten
or eleven years old...

491
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:29,125
... one day Ramesh approached
me and told me to have a cigarette.

492
00:55:30,028 --> 00:55:31,359
l refused.

493
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:36,322
He started laughing aloud
and called me a coward.

494
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:40,997
l didn't feel bad about being called
a coward, but his laughter hurt.

495
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:44,732
l felt a vigor inside me and said
give it to me, l'll have it too.

496
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:47,206
l took it and had a deep drag.

497
00:55:48,146 --> 00:55:51,047
And it was all over.
l started coughing heavily.

498
00:55:51,249 --> 00:55:54,082
The coughing made
me red in the face.

499
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:57,418
Meanwhile the professor
of mathematics arrived.

500
00:55:57,722 --> 00:56:01,453
He stood up
and started smelling.

501
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,386
And l was standing
there red in the face.

502
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:08,360
A thief cannot hide
for long. He saw me.

503
00:56:08,566 --> 00:56:11,501
And he said 'Hey Subir, come here'

504
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:14,470
l went near him
'Open your mouth'

505
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:18,173
He took a smell,
and caught me.

506
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:22,472
'So that's it. There's a stick
in the other room, go and get it'

507
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,374
Think of my plight then.
l'm about to be hit...

508
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,881
... and he's asking
me to get the stick.

509
00:56:28,086 --> 00:56:29,883
Well, l went and got the stick.

510
00:56:30,088 --> 00:56:33,854
As soon as l returned, he gave
me one hard rap on the hand.

511
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:37,088
- Enough. l don't want to hear it.
- Why?

512
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:40,230
May such a professor
suffer from fits.

513
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:43,725
Did it hurt very much?

514
00:56:50,675 --> 00:56:53,473
Hey, he hit me
on this hand too.

515
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,050
- Vermilion
- So what?

516
00:57:05,957 --> 00:57:08,448
lf someone sees it
what'll he think?

517
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:09,785
What?

518
00:57:20,972 --> 00:57:24,703
l'm Radha here. We met at
the Haridas Convention.

519
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:32,950
Yes, l recognise you.
What can l do for you?

520
00:57:33,151 --> 00:57:36,018
- Are you really married?
- Yes.

521
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,652
Where's your wife?

522
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:42,420
She has gone to
her parents' house.

523
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:47,360
Why did you get married?
Was it right to break so many hearts?

524
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,930
What can l do?
l too regret my mistake.

525
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,069
- Really!
- Yes.

526
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:58,539
l'm thinking of how to get out of
this dilemma. How to get a divorce!

527
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:03,046
Who's that?
Whose voice is that?

528
00:58:03,214 --> 00:58:08,811
Me! My name is Uma.
l'm Mr.Subir's wife.

529
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:23,934
- What happened?
- Nothing, let me sleep.

530
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:27,499
- Tell me, what happened?
- l said nothing!...

531
00:58:27,772 --> 00:58:29,865
... Let me sleep,
it's almost morning.

532
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:32,941
You were fine just a moment ago.
What angered you so much now?

533
00:58:33,144 --> 00:58:36,409
This is what used to
happen before l came, right?

534
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:39,606
Girls calling up so late in
the night and you talking to them.

535
00:58:39,817 --> 00:58:42,547
That was then,
it won't happen now.

536
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:45,381
- Really it won't happen now.
- Swear by me?

537
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,751
Yes l do, but you have to
agree to my condition too.

538
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:50,052
- What's that?
- Listen.

539
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:53,628
Everyday not more,
just a hundred or two...

540
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:58,829
Listen! l'll lower
it to only ten.

541
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,528
Uma, listen, hey!

542
00:59:26,631 --> 00:59:28,098
Hey, wake up.

543
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:38,767
Wake up.

544
00:59:56,694 --> 00:59:58,753
Let me go, leave me.

545
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:02,618
Keep singing, it's
such a nice tune.

546
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:05,123
How did you like the lyrics?

547
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:11,326
lf the tune is good,
the lyrics become good too.
