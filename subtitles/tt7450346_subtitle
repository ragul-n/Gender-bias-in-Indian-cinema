1
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,379
'Five-coloured Parrot'

2
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,578
Dad,

3
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:12,239
can you bring me a parrot like that?

4
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:58,377
Are you ready?

5
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,506
Ask him to stop it!

6
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,079
I can't hear you!

7
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:23,113
Are you ready for the rhythm of Punjab?

8
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:35,377
Come on, bride's uncle...
Dance!

9
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:40,046
Us relatives meet each other
only once in 3-4 years.

10
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,105
Huh? - Us relatives meet each other
only once in 3-4 years.

11
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:47,578
But they are not able to talk
to each other or catch up.

12
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:51,012
I didn't invite that
long-haired fellow.

13
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:54,480
He is the bride's brother's friend.
PJ Joseph.

14
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:57,104
Not PJ Joseph.
DJ Joseph!

15
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,532
If it was PJ Joseph, he would've
sung a couple of songs. That's all!

16
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:00,732
But is that what's happening here?

17
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:01,711
Hello?

18
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:02,745
Hello?

19
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:05,172
Not left..
To the right! Right!

20
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,010
Put your hands together for
the rhythm of Chennai"!

21
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,671
He was adamant that he
wanted this Christian girl.

22
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,580
Both the families weren't
really interested in this..

23
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:25,071
But if we say something,
that's enough for them!

24
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,335
Stop drinking, man!

25
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,071
You can't play properly
if the shiver goes away.

26
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:35,444
A procession of 50 Enfield bikes
from the house to the wedding venue!

27
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,208
All those on the way would
have remembered me!

28
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:39,245
Why?

29
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,643
I am his father, right?

30
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,112
From there till this
auditorium, in a horse-cart!

31
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,271
Are they reaching only now?

32
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,370
Since when did this
DJ become so big?

33
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:49,039
That Joseph is just playing
music and acting with it.

34
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,145
He sells Sweet Paan
at the boat jetty.

35
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:09,376
Put your hands together for
Diana and Unnikrishnan!

36
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:12,245
Not this one.

37
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,271
Not this one either.

38
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,444
Have you joint it?

39
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:29,240
No! This is not a joint!

40
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,370
Do you have stuff with you?

41
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,112
Don't worry! Not to scold you.
We can all have a round.

42
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,099
There's some booze in the van.

43
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,545
Don't give them what we have.

44
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,637
The nearest liquor
shop is 30 kms away.

45
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,678
Oh no!

46
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:45,745
Hey!

47
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:48,511
Come here.

48
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:49,545
What is it?

49
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,766
What's the matter?
- Hey!

50
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,542
Come here.
- What is it?

51
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,341
They are almost here.
Come here, I say!

52
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,004
What is it?
Tell me!

53
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,266
They won't reach!
Come here!

54
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:00,337
Nonsense!

55
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,075
The vehicle that was bringing Biriyanis
for 400 people, broke its axle.

56
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,747
They will be late to reach here.
- Oh God!

57
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:11,478
Are you coming here or not?
- Crap!

58
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,238
I mean... Yes!
You also come!

59
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,611
Oh! The goof is here!

60
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,340
Not goof... Groom!

61
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,741
Both are the same!

62
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,580
Shouldn't we serve the food
as soon as they get on stage?

63
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,510
Food! Food!

64
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,403
Nonsense!

65
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:32,146
His bloody Sweet Paan business!

66
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,707
How can you say that?

67
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,579
Can I ask the guests to wait for some time,
and that they'll be served Biriyani later?

68
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,306
Some time will pass with presenting
gifts, and clicking photos.

69
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:07,142
What will we do after that?

70
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,299
They'll reach here in 10
minutes, if there's no block!

71
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,712
Will they say that there's no block?
- Well.. That...

72
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:36,745
What happened?

73
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,741
Did the bride elope with someone?

74
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:40,766
That's a fashion now.

75
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,441
It's the groom's dad!
- So did the dad elope?

76
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,407
What do you want?

77
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:48,173
I had asked to arrange for
some grass to feed the horse.

78
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:50,543
There's no Biriyani to feed
the bride's father here.

79
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,713
And you want grass for
your bloody horse?

80
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,735
Five more minutes?

81
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,102
What do I tell the guests here?

82
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,311
A strong driver has reached
there with another vehicle.

83
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:14,612
We have to entertain the
guests for 5 minutes, somehow.

84
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,306
Don't smile so much.

85
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,073
I just need attitude on your face.

86
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,513
You shouldn't smile when
they click the photo.

87
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,547
I just need one still of both
of them sitting atop the horse.

88
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,578
That's not enough.

89
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:10,375
Hey horse-man! Get them on
top of it, and make it walk.

90
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,468
In the wedding CD,

91
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:16,380
I'll turn it into 1000 horses flying
through the clouds spreading their wings.

92
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:19,532
I'll do it in graphics.
- Stop bragging and help me with this.

93
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:21,466
Me?
- Hop on, buddy.

94
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:24,004
Are you scared?
- Not at all!

95
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,307
Unni, keep quiet.
- Hold me tight.

96
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:29,005
I'll fall!
- Unni, keep quiet.

97
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:31,707
I'll fall! Mom! Dad!
- Unni, keep quiet!

98
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:35,246
Keep quiet!

99
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,099
You saved my honour.

100
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,445
Even though the song was bad,
people sat there listening to it.

101
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,147
Hey! Are you coming or not?

102
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,478
Coming!

103
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,080
There's much more than
what I promised.

104
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,311
Here.

105
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,578
Gone, Praveen Chetta!

106
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,408
Our Babu uncle..
- What happened?

107
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,578
Come!

108
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:04,171
Are you ready?

109
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,669
<i>Shakthi Mum Gymnasium'.!</i>

110
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,332
<i>Shakthi Mum Gymnasium'.!</i>

111
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,644
A trusted institution, by Mr. India Shibu,

112
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,737
will be inaugurated by MLA Kalesh.

113
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,746
<i>Shakthi Mum Gymnasium'.!</i>

114
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,371
Just consider it as a
close friend's advice.

115
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:22,440
You're a driver, right?

116
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:25,443
No one can predict what will
happen to you and when!

117
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,709
So, it's better that
you take a policy.

118
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,973
I'll have to pay 50,000 thrice, right?
- Yes.

119
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:35,037
The function has just started here.

120
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,976
Election is coming soon, right?

121
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:38,576
He won't displease anyone.

122
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:39,745
Okay.

123
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,300
The runner-up of Mr. India competition, Mr.
Shiju, who came here upon our invite.

124
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:49,276
He is the one who's starting
such a gymnasium here.

125
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,540
I heartily welcome him
to this function.

126
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:57,642
Along with that,
the pride of our town...

127
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,010
as soon as we went and invited,

128
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:03,766
the one who admitted that he has no
other job and that he would come..

129
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:09,342
Our dearest MLA Mr. Kalesh,
we welcome him to this function.

130
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:13,379
Now I'm going to welcome...

131
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:20,248
a lady, who fulfils all needs of ours
without any hesitation, at any time!

132
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:24,009
Which year did you become Mr. India?
- 2002.

133
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:28,070
You've been like this, since then?

134
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,136
Have you thought about wearing a 'Mundu'?
- No way!

135
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:33,605
No?

136
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,232
Our 9th ward member,

137
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,076
the public asset of this town,

138
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:39,135
Maya Baby"
To welcome her,

139
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,202
I invite Aluva Jinto.

140
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,571
Jinto, who's known as
the Arnold ofAluva.

141
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:51,706
He's also an artist who scored A grade
in the tribal dance competition,

142
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,509
organized by 'Smiles' Arts <i>&</i> Sports Club.

143
00:17:58,767 --> 00:17:59,745
Bless you!

144
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:06,176
I invite our dear MLA
to speak a few words.

145
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,771
My dear friends,
brothers and sisters...

146
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,079
First of all I want to
express my gratitude

147
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,170
for the love that you're
all showering upon me.

148
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:31,482
One of man's greatest assets is power..
or health!

149
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:33,740
He's wasting time
with this speech.

150
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,535
Look at that guy's body!

151
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:37,245
What body?

152
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,435
There's only a small
difference between him and me.

153
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,979
He's wearing an underwear,
but no 'Mundu'.

154
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,240
I'm wearing a 'Mundu',
but no underwear.

155
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:49,333
I humbly request you to vote for
me in the symbol of elephant,

156
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:52,343
which is a synonym for power.

157
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,714
With your permission, I shall inaugurate...

158
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,978
It's upstairs.

159
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,340
Where's the east here?
- Where's the east?

160
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,276
Ask someone!

161
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,108
Someone go down and check.

162
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:08,599
Don't you know where east is?
- I'm not from this town!

163
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,299
Why did you ask where's east?

164
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,399
To light the wick of the lam p..

165
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,539
You needn't light a lamp
to inaugurate here..

166
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,076
Did you see that?

167
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:21,309
Just pull it close to your chest,
and inaugurate it.

168
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,408
Just pull it to your chest.
Simple!

169
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,480
Yes. Like that!

170
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,671
Pull it close to your chest!

171
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,777
You can do it this time.

172
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:46,273
To your chest!

173
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,371
Udayetta!

174
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,248
A small gift from us to you, MLA sir.

175
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:08,045
Take it.

176
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:09,575
Take it.
- Come on.

177
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,341
I've not at all particular
that you should buy this.

178
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:14,379
If you're buying it, you should
pay the price I'm asking for.

179
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:16,037
Chechi, in a business..

180
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,773
Don't teach me about business.

181
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,742
What about 1.5?
- This sale won't happen for 1.5...

182
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,010
Many people came and
quoted prices..

183
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,202
Everything has a
deserving price, right?

184
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,605
Final price - 1.60

185
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,178
If that's okay, tell me..

186
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,510
Chechi, think about
it once more...

187
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,478
I just thought, let this sale
happen if it's going to happen.

188
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,247
You're going to sell it again
for a higher profit, right?

189
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:42,237
I can't pay more than 1.5 Rupees
for a broken beer bottle!

190
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:46,740
The Tamilian who used to come regularly,
used to pay Rs.1.80

191
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:52,033
One day, he argued with me for
just 25 paise, pointlessly!

192
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,166
You should pay attention now.

193
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:59,048
That poor thing just crossed the
road with the sack on his head...

194
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:01,712
Atipper lorry...

195
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,071
It's because of his greed!

196
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,408
Now you quote a price!

197
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,706
1.5 Only!

198
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,405
Then keep that bottle aside.

199
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:14,414
Tell me how much you can pay for
the newspaper. - Let me see.

200
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,599
Is it a fake weighing machine?
- Can't get anything by selling newspapers!

201
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,206
Have you heard about a Mam men
Mappillai from Kottayam?

202
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,213
He created such a huge empire,
by selling newspapers!

203
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,740
It's been 3 weeks since I gave
them 2 churidars to shape.

204
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,308
Even when I went today,
she hadn't touched it.

205
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,237
I stayed there and
got it stitched.

206
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:51,166
However fitting the clothes are, you'll
be happy only if your shape it again!

207
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,145
That's true!

208
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:55,107
You should shape it.
Only then it will look good.

209
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,311
You don't know all this, aunty!

210
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,566
What's your name, Chechi?

211
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,566
Ch itra.

212
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:00,545
Do you sing?

213
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,578
No!

214
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:05,012
For slim and tall women like you,
body fit churidars match very well!

215
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,579
If it's a saree, it
will be awesome!

216
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,405
If so, shall I buy all
this for 30 Rupees?

217
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,241
35!
- Give it, mom!

218
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,102
What is this?

219
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,672
You cannot bring all this in here.
Move away.

220
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:21,542
Exactly!
Move away!

221
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,099
Come in, sir.

222
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,340
Come in, sirs.

223
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,075
Get in.
- Good afternoon.

224
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:30,711
Keep the AC high.
- It's on maximum.

225
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,269
This is Eappachan Sir.

226
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:37,076
He has a family
business of wood.

227
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:39,409
And he also does some real
estate and car sales.

228
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:42,213
You have a school with you, right?
So how's the deal?

229
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:45,341
<i>90</i> cent <i>land and school
at Edathalakkadu.</i>

230
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:48,477
The school building is
almost 60 years old.

231
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,444
It's old?
- Don't bother about that.

232
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:52,632
You'll get at least Rs.
1 Lakh per cent.

233
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:54,772
Sir, ticket.
- 3 tickets to Karikkode.

234
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:59,076
Since it's an old school, the townsmen
might create a problem if we sell it.

235
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,237
Is it? Let's discuss then.

236
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,040
What's the doubt about?

237
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:04,338
Well, it's a school, right?

238
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,778
Even if we get it for a low price,
it will be trouble.

239
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,343
Sir is saying that it will be
very difficult to sell it.

240
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,572
Did you have tea, sir?

241
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:11,734
No.

242
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,769
Karikkode!

243
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,604
Reached Karikkode!
- 3 tickets to Peruva!

244
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:33,009
To buy a school for 90 Lakhs,

245
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:35,613
Sir cannot take a decision alone..

246
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,203
He has to discuss
with his partners.

247
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,577
If it was a plantation, I'd have bought
it with closed eyes for this price.

248
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:42,010
Do you something like that?

249
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:43,607
I'm not a broker.

250
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,679
I have another business.

251
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,406
Well.. They don't need brokers.

252
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,366
That's why I didn't come into the picture.
- Vengaloor.

253
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:50,345
Excuse me.

254
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,499
Even if it's a foreigner, it hurts
when they stamp on our foot.

255
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,002
Tolerate some pain, sir.

256
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,045
Hey!

257
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:59,339
The company that runs this school
has other colleges as well.

258
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,740
Engineering college, Dental
college and many more..

259
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,977
They told this to me when I went to sell
2 Labradors at their Ladies Hostel...

260
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:09,274
To see if there are any buyers"
- La bra...?

261
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,779
Yes!
I have a business of selling dogs"

262
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:13,245
Peru va!

263
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,099
Those who've to get
down at Peruva, please.

264
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,545
3 tickets to Vellur.

265
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I didn't come here to do real estate
business with half-crazy dog-sellers!

266
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,778
Got it?
- Sir..

267
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:34,079
Within the next 3 years, 4 teachers
are going to retire from that school.

268
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:36,672
For every newly
appointed teacher,

269
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,411
the management can ask
for 35 Lakhs per person.

270
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,299
If the school is in your hand,

271
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,442
per person 35 Lakhs..
Won't you get 1 crore and 40 Lakhs?

272
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,572
Now you're going to spend 90 Lakhs.

273
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:53,337
It's a huge profit, right?

274
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:56,744
They said that they will buy one
more dog if this sale happens.

275
00:24:58,067 --> 00:24:59,045
Aren't you getting down?

276
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,978
3 tickets to Vellur.

277
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,136
This is Vellur.
Get down fast.

278
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:07,339
Shall we go for another round
via Karikkode and Peruva?

279
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:09,432
There's a chance for
this sale to happen.

280
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:12,676
We won't allow your sales in this bus.
Go and get a room in some hotel.

281
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:15,543
Troubling us unnecessarily"
- Why are you getting so angry?

282
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,705
This is usual!
The next bus will come soon.

283
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,004
This will cost extra money.

284
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,602
Don't bother about money, brother.

285
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:35,604
Mom..

286
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,613
This is called Atkins diet.

287
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:40,375
We should use proteins alone,
and burn all the fat.

288
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:42,246
Do you remember Shibu?

289
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:43,335
I know!

290
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,432
He was caught by police for letting the
septic tank open to the river, right?

291
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:47,411
No.

292
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,310
Oh! The Shibu, who studied
with you in school.

293
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,776
The guy who had rashes till
his knees and kept itching!

294
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:56,976
With all those rashes, that boy passed
his Hindi exams in first class, right?

295
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:58,512
That's 'Mucous' Shibu!

296
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:01,079
He is in America now..
- Can you please stop it?

297
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,406
I want to eat dinner.

298
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:03,445
Have it.

299
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,070
That can be seen on
your body as well.

300
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:06,407
I am slim only!

301
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,332
Even today someone told me that.

302
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,040
Who?
- A scrap seller.

303
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:11,607
You tell me..
Who is this Shibu?

304
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:12,711
Mr. India.

305
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:16,605
He eats 30 egg whites, daily.
Thirty!

306
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:19,043
So aren't you eating rice tonight?
- No!

307
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,599
Hey! No need to protect your
health by avoiding food.

308
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,732
Once the election is announced
<i>&</i> the campaign starts,

309
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,610
you won't be able to
eat anything on time.

310
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,778
Enough.

311
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:29,546
Back then, during the election season...

312
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,602
his father used to
have 6 meals a day.

313
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,771
House full of workers,
and food for all of them!

314
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,699
I don't let the workers
come here, on purpose.

315
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,044
If they keep coming here and
spoil this house <i>&</i> garden,

316
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,579
what explanation will
I give to Naseel'?

317
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:45,078
Your father has helped
Naseer and his father a lot, son.

318
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:48,780
We're not staying here because we longed
to stay in such a huge house, are we?

319
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,632
Who can be trusted to look after
such a huge house othenlvise?

320
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:55,410
In this case, it's a matter of pride for
Naseer that the MLA stays here, right?

321
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:56,445
<i>Mm.!</i>

322
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:59,266
Last time, there was a sympathy
wave because of his fathefs death.

323
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:00,245
This time..

324
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:03,041
At least by a majority
of 7000 votes,

325
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,977
he will lose!

326
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,341
7000 votes?

327
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,435
Wanna bet?
- Yes! How much?

328
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:12,039
I'll give you 7000 Rupees.
Place the bet!

329
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:14,239
I'm placing a bet for 7000 Rupees!

330
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,010
In this election, my dear Kaleshettan
will lose for at least 10,000 votes!

331
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:20,599
7000!
- 10,000!

332
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,273
7000!
- 10,000!

333
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:23,311
Can you stop it?

334
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:25,005
Won't even let me eat!

335
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,738
You just keep yapping!

336
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,613
What about the eggs?
- He'll get them after the elections!

337
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:37,603
Who's sharing the matters that we
discuss in the group, outside?

338
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,146
Nafeesa got both my voice
note and its screenshot.

339
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:44,599
The one who did it, will
be struck by lightning!

340
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,137
Whoever it is, she
will be damned!

341
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:49,266
Haven't I asked you not to
talk while it's charging?

342
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,406
It's just that it shouldn't
be held to the ear, right?

343
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,478
Your ear...

344
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:55,411
Who is it?

345
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,978
It's Kaleshettan.

346
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,006
Where did we stop?
- Ya! Getting struck by lightning!

347
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:05,604
I even thought about leaving
this group called 'Cute Ladies'.

348
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,278
Don't do that.

349
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,077
And ya, that Soumya's husband
will divorce her mostly.

350
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:13,077
She deserves that!

351
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:14,503
But still..

352
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,547
Who would have taken the
screenshot of me cribbing...

353
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:19,237
Leave it..

354
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,233
The one who did it.. I want to see
her dying without a drop of water to drink!

355
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,542
Shall we start another group?

356
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:24,645
Okay.

357
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,738
Well.. What do we name our new group?

358
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,605
Yes!
Positive Thinkers!

359
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,078
That's nice.

360
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,604
Bye then.
See you later.

361
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,074
How many times have I told you
to keep this filled with water?

362
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:40,673
Is it normal water?

363
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,769
There was cumin water
in the kitchen!

364
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:45,577
Let it be there.
You lie down here.

365
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,770
Do you know something?

366
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:52,247
We are humans, right?

367
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,476
Daily, we should be drinking
at least 8 litres of water.

368
00:28:58,467 --> 00:28:59,775
Water will burn fat!

369
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,432
You've been talking about this fat
burning ever since you came today.

370
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:05,435
I'm always been 56 kgs..
Be it earlier, or now!

371
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:08,144
That will all change
with just one delivery.

372
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:12,373
But that will never happen
in our lives, right?

373
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,540
HEW'

374
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,008
Are you crying?

375
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:32,711
What is this, dear?

376
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,569
We talk about it
like this, right?

377
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,278
Did it hurt you?

378
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:40,180
A child will come into our lives,
as both of us wished.

379
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:45,205
Why are you crying?

380
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:48,012
Why are you giggling?

381
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:49,741
Nothing.

382
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:52,980
I was just looking at the one who's
going to jog from tomorrow morning.

383
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,273
I'll go! I'll go jogging every
morning hereafter! Why?

384
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:59,139
I heard this during your last
birthday and the new year as well.

385
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:02,681
Go to sleep!
I must burn fat from tomorrow!

386
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:06,078
Come on, Kalesh!
- Runner Kuttappan!

387
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:18,079
Have the muscles decreased?

388
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:20,071
It's the first day, right?

389
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:21,669
Chitra! Hey!

390
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:24,338
Come. Get up.
Let's go jogging!

391
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:29,713
Fresh air, birds chirping"
We can enjoy all that!

392
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,011
I'm not coming!

393
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:34,269
Don't you want to hear the chirping?

394
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,478
No.

395
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,410
Shall we stay on the bed,
for some more time?

396
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,646
Don't think that I'll fall
for your temptations.

397
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,411
You sleep, my dear"

398
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,138
I'll go exercise and come!

399
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:48,107
She thinks she's actress
Bhanupriya from 'Rajashilpi' movie.

400
00:30:58,667 --> 00:30:59,645
Oh my God!

401
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:03,775
You would've slit my throat now.

402
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,036
Good morning sir.
- Good morning!

403
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:11,742
Good morning, Chetta.
- Good morning.

404
00:31:16,634 --> 00:31:18,272
Good morning sir..
- Morning"

405
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,378
Are you alone?

406
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,509
Well.. I haven't see you
around on this route earlier"

407
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,466
I take a different
route usually"

408
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,673
20 kilom etres.

409
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:29,337
20 kilometres?

410
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,742
Ijog for half an hour.
I go by time.

411
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,599
Chin nam ma Chech I!

412
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,766
Get lost you scoundrel.
Call your mom that, you dog!

413
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:41,213
No need breakfast now, right?
- Follow her. You'll also get it.

414
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,766
Don't worry, Colonel Uncle.
- I've seen much more at the border.

415
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:45,508
Culture less fellows.

416
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,102
Sorry sir.

417
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:52,446
Sir, we should repair these roads.

418
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:55,740
Seems like you're really shy.

419
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:57,444
You're not saying anything.

420
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:59,410
We shouldn't talk while running"
- Sir...

421
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,580
Our body is our asset.

422
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:04,310
You're really lucky..

423
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,176
Your abdomen is really small"

424
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:08,405
I'm going this way!

425
00:32:09,434 --> 00:32:10,674
Sir, I'll also come.

426
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:13,344
No problem if I take a
different route for a day.

427
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,444
- I'll go home then.

428
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,602
Sir, running together, huh?

429
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,432
Notjust running, we even sleep together.
Why do you care? Loser!

430
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:25,347
Even though his son has his colour, he has
the same cat eyes like his neighbour Jayan.

431
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:32,273
Why are you laughing?

432
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,540
Long back, there was a
Madan sir in Bombay.

433
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,704
He also ran away like this once.
- When?

434
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,279
When there was a
raid in the hotel.

435
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,236
Oh no!
Sir! Sir!

436
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:45,638
There's no one who is courageous
in the current ministry.

437
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:12,577
I will be there with you to annihilate even
the last street dog of this constituency!

438
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:31,744
It's not in front of me,
or behind me!

439
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,238
It's walking along with me.

440
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:34,707
A terrible situation!

441
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,041
Nothing else to do!

442
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:38,611
Just run fast, like how
you would write '8'.

443
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,778
Eight?

444
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:46,473
Eight!

445
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,678
Get lost, you dog!

446
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:37,742
Don't tell your father that I
bought this ice candy for you.

447
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,778
I won't.

448
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:41,343
Didn't you go to school today?

449
00:34:41,634 --> 00:34:43,443
No. I had a stomach ache.

450
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,278
Excuse me..

451
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:52,445
He really wants to grow a pet"

452
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:58,446
Don't buy these for time pass
like you buy toys for kids.

453
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,581
If it's an animal we can grow"
- It's not like that.

454
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,008
We should see whether we
are suitable for them!

455
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,409
Did you see her'?
- The cat?

456
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,344
A dentist in the locality, John sir..
bought her once..

457
00:35:15,134 --> 00:35:18,172
Keeping her food for
3-4 days on a plate,

458
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:20,143
locked her inside their house,

459
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:22,304
John sir and family went
on atourto Munnar.

460
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:23,366
What breed is this?

461
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:24,573
This..
- I'll say it!

462
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,041
Persian cat!

463
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,581
With the wind, the door of the room
where the food was kept, got closed.

464
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,570
Until they came back
after the tour,

465
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:35,069
this one didn't get
any food or water.

466
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,578
He dropped her back here, as
she was almost about to die.

467
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:40,710
He told me to sell it
if a good buyer comes.

468
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,109
Did you see that
she's all smart now?

469
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,578
Kiddo, are you fine with this one?

470
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:48,566
Here.
- Take it.

471
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:50,706
What are you going to name her, kiddo?
- Dora.

472
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:54,599
Uncle, come here.
Fasfl

473
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,409
<i>The chick 'gust poked
its head out.</i>

474
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,502
Is this the father or the
mother of the chick?

475
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:04,645
That's the father.

476
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,204
How do you know that?

477
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:08,145
Among these love birds,

478
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:10,713
the males will have a blue
colour on top of their noses.

479
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,579
Females won't have that.

480
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,145
Look carefully.

481
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,378
Come.

482
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,109
Isn't daddy at home?
- No.

483
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:21,268
That's what!

484
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:31,240
Tea is on the table.
Have it.

485
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:33,706
Take bath <i>&</i> go for tuition!

486
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,078
Come back here!

487
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,973
You keep going there
all the time,

488
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,374
whenever we don't pay attention.

489
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,070
Come and do your home work.

490
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,643
Can't you get some Bengali
to work for you there?

491
00:36:45,067 --> 00:36:46,740
You shouldn't be making
my son work for you!

492
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:48,774
Bengalis are also humans!

493
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,078
That's true!

494
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:52,566
I don't call him.

495
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:55,173
He comes here on his own to see
all these animals and birds.

496
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:56,707
Rama Chechi, you know right?

497
00:36:56,767 --> 00:37:00,146
With all this smell <i>&</i> dust,
the kids are constantly sick!

498
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:02,140
Is there a smell?
- You shut up!

499
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:03,577
Can't even talk or what?
- Hey!

500
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,341
Why do you keep going there?

501
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:08,741
To see if the egg has hatched.
- Go inside.

502
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:12,577
Hey! The association members
have complained against you.

503
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,602
Pack all your stuff and
be ready to leave!

504
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,478
Hey!

505
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,678
What happened?

506
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,438
Has this one been vaccinated?

507
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,740
If I had seen the dog that bit you, I
could have bought some Iimejuice for it.

508
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:37,110
To see if it has rabies.

509
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,646
It's safe to take an injection.

510
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:41,407
Now you can take
it on your hand.

511
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,599
If it was earlier, they would have made
a graffiti around your bellybutton.

512
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,637
In spite of having such
a big set up and a car,

513
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:48,406
how did you get
bitten by a dog, sir?

514
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,599
He went to hear the chirping of birds.

515
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,307
And look now!
He burned fat as well.

516
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,168
What's your name?

517
00:37:54,234 --> 00:37:55,212
Ch itra.

518
00:37:55,267 --> 00:37:56,541
DO you sing',
<i>'</i> No! '?

519
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:01,612
I'm scared of injections!

520
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:03,042
She doesn't sing.

521
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:05,407
But sir..
He failed in a music degree"

522
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,105
He wanted to be a singer.

523
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:09,771
But he had to come into
politics suddenly.

524
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,078
Unfortunate.

525
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,433
You didn't believe me
when I told you, right?

526
00:38:13,434 --> 00:38:15,066
Are you happy now that
you've fallen sick?

527
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:16,569
That's the benefit
of taking a policy.

528
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,443
Maximum one more time here..

529
00:38:21,534 --> 00:38:22,512
<i>Chem"
- Ne'.!</i>

530
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:25,007
Everything is okay, right?

531
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:27,570
Such a protest march hasn't happened
at the junction before this.

532
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:30,376
What is it? -We'll burn the
effigy of the dog in the evening.

533
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,004
Effigy of the dog?

534
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:33,603
We can't do anything else.

535
00:38:34,134 --> 00:38:36,239
Dogs have connections
up in Delhi as well.

536
00:38:36,433 --> 00:38:38,276
Sir, what about our
nurses' problem?

537
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:39,744
All that we'll talk
in the MLA office.

538
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:48,372
There's no particular
scheme or fund for this.

539
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,541
Let me try talking to
the Chief Minister.

540
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,247
And we're not supposed to donate to private
parties from the MLA fund as well.

541
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,278
Let's see.

542
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,539
You know that the condition of the
orphanage is really bad, right?

543
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,245
You don't worry at all!

544
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,745
I'll try my best!

545
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,541
Thank you.
- Okay.

546
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:19,445
Come.

547
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:21,245
Walk carefully.

548
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,075
Are you busy, sir?

549
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:26,604
How come you're here?
- I'm bound to come here, right?

550
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,146
Oh! The full family is here?

551
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:30,166
I came because I need
to get something done.

552
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,773
And.. A function is coming up.
I'll tell you about it later.

553
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,107
Why are you angry, St. George?

554
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:36,736
Not St. George.
Geevarghese.

555
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,336
Did you lose weight, Kalesh?

556
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,633
I've been running around, right?

557
00:39:40,634 --> 00:39:42,739
If you're busy, I'm not
troubling you further. Here.

558
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:45,045
What is this?

559
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:47,042
There's a pet-shop owner
next to my house.

560
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,104
Someone who sells birds, parrots and dogs.
He's a nuisance.

561
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:54,099
The residents' association has
filed a complaint via the police.

562
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,101
To shift him from there.

563
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:59,240
A case is going on,
but it will take a long time, right?

564
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:01,438
Everyone there knows
that we are friends.

565
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:04,777
It's a petition signed by all the
neighbours to chase him away from there.

566
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,178
Hey!

567
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:11,045
Why is he angry?

568
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,046
We can't say what kind of
people these guys are!

569
00:40:13,334 --> 00:40:15,746
They won't even hesitate to kidnap
our children. - That's true.

570
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:22,238
Anyway, let me enquire once.

571
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:24,407
Okay then.
- Okay.

572
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:26,211
And ya..

573
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:27,607
Election is coming up.
- I know!

574
00:40:27,734 --> 00:40:29,736
Don't forget me.
The symbol is elephant!

575
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:33,508
If a decision is made about this, all
the people there would vote for you.

576
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,045
Fine?
- Okay then.

577
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,704
Is this yours?

578
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,278
Not the banana.

579
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,470
This set-up!

580
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:02,743
Go and bring the license,
registration <i>&</i> other documents.

581
00:41:19,467 --> 00:41:20,571
What is this?
Mashed potatoes?

582
00:41:21,267 --> 00:41:22,299
Where is the title deed?

583
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,177
This is an original
deed document, sir.

584
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:27,272
I came here for a
circus long back.

585
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:30,036
Back then, all this used
to belong to one family.

586
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,406
Later, all the other neighbours got
title deeds registered in their names.

587
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,043
They are the ones who have complained
to evacuate you from here.

588
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:39,606
I cam to know about that.
It's a case, right?

589
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,536
The case will take its course.

590
00:41:41,734 --> 00:41:43,736
But now I got a call
from the MLA's office.

591
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,238
This is an enquiry for that.

592
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:48,047
Sir, when I came here back then,
there was no one here.

593
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:49,411
Not even this road...

594
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,641
And, when this place
changed so much...

595
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:54,638
I became really happy!

596
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,606
Now they will be happy only
if I move out from here.

597
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:01,308
Are you alone here?

598
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,243
There were 4-5 regular workers.

599
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:05,109
Now I call them only
when they're needed.

600
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:08,512
You have a pet business?
- Yes.

601
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,771
He acted with Mammootty
in 'Pulimurugan'.

602
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,570
Mohanlal!
- Is it?

603
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:19,308
These guys went to
Hyderabad for 'Baahubali'.

604
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,572
What else do you have?

605
00:42:21,634 --> 00:42:23,409
Nothing much, sir.

606
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:24,737
Just one elephant.

607
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,575
Oh!
- Uncle!

608
00:42:27,234 --> 00:42:28,212
Where's your camel?

609
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,271
I have just one.

610
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:38,705
It's an original deed before '76, right?

611
00:42:39,234 --> 00:42:41,043
The judgment will
take a long time.

612
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:44,148
You might not have to shift,
but you'll have to get rid of all of them.

613
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,972
Come!

614
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,045
Here's your mashed potato!

615
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:58,074
Hey! Come here!

616
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:06,044
What is it, sir?
- Does the Indian Cuckoo talk?

617
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:08,747
Indian Cuckoo!
Cuckoo!

618
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,074
Does it talk?

619
00:43:10,134 --> 00:43:11,272
Sometimes.
- Is it?

620
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:15,033
You know what? I got a cuckoo
while I was studying in school.

621
00:43:15,034 --> 00:43:16,599
I raised it for a long time.

622
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,045
I fed it herbs as well.

623
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,602
But it never talked"

624
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:22,240
If it was now, he would've
punched it to make it talk.

625
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,766
Jimmy sir, our leader!

626
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:29,766
Lead us with valour!
- Kalesh, our leader!

627
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:31,576
There are Lakhs behind you!

628
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:33,170
Lead us with valour!

629
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:36,333
Kalesh, our leader!

630
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:39,008
Lead us with valour!

631
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,271
All the three times my
father filed his nomination,

632
00:43:42,534 --> 00:43:43,999
you were with him, Udayettan!

633
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,274
My father is no more now.

634
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:47,746
You should take his
position and bless me.

635
00:43:55,134 --> 00:43:56,112
Give it.

636
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,012
Sir..

637
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:07,377
30,000 Rupees, wedding
ring and a BSA cycle?

638
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:10,239
Those are your only assets?

639
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:14,141
There are talks that the house
you're staying in now, is yours

640
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,499
or that you're a benami

641
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,433
There 3-4 covers of ribbons and scissors
as well. Should we add that too?

642
00:44:18,434 --> 00:44:19,572
No need!

643
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:22,237
What's your wife's name?

644
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,378
Ch itra.

645
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:25,012
Do you sing?
- No.

646
00:44:26,434 --> 00:44:29,506
Kalesh sir, our leader!

647
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,638
Lead us with valour!

648
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,112
The coconut tree doesn't cheat.
The coconut doesn't cheat.

649
00:44:34,234 --> 00:44:38,205
No one has died
due to a coconut.

650
00:44:38,267 --> 00:44:40,008
All the best!
- All the best!

651
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,633
Chetta, our symbol is elephant!

652
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:44,612
I don't vote!

653
00:44:47,733 --> 00:44:48,711
Sir..

654
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,474
What is it?
- Here's the fees.

655
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,179
It's the first time someone
is paying fees to me.

656
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,478
Hey!

657
00:45:14,534 --> 00:45:17,133
Even if it's through the film,
if you look at the sun for long,

658
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:18,306
it will damage your eyes.

659
00:45:19,267 --> 00:45:20,245
This...

660
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:22,475
Let this be here.

661
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,307
If it's here, the birds
won't feel the heat.

662
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,240
A foreigner who came for an
exhibition in Ernakulam told me,

663
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:32,348
there's a zoo in a place called
San Diego, somewhere in America.

664
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:34,208
It's been 100 years
since they started it.

665
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,241
When you grow up, you
should go there.

666
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:38,675
Now go home, boy!
- I won't go!

667
00:45:39,334 --> 00:45:41,473
If your Mummy or Daddy comes
back, they will scold me.

668
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,375
They won't scold you..
- Why?

669
00:45:43,434 --> 00:45:46,244
They have gone to the Church
to book the parish hall.

670
00:45:46,434 --> 00:45:47,466
Geevarghese!

671
00:45:47,467 --> 00:45:48,707
What is it?
- Come here.

672
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,473
Drink this milk and go.
- Bring it here.

673
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:52,636
Can I jump over this
wall and come there?

674
00:45:52,734 --> 00:45:54,042
Come here, dear"
- No.

675
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:57,175
When your daddy comes, I'll
tell him what you were doing.

676
00:45:57,234 --> 00:46:00,433
Don't get beaten up for my sake.

677
00:46:00,434 --> 00:46:02,107
Give it to me.
I'll give him.

678
00:46:02,267 --> 00:46:03,473
Return the cup soon.

679
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:05,312
Breathe out!

680
00:46:05,434 --> 00:46:07,038
Get lost!

681
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,145
Have you boozed?

682
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:09,745
No!

683
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,245
You have!

684
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:13,038
Haven't you had a
couple of drinks?

685
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,979
No.
Send the cup with him.

686
00:46:15,034 --> 00:46:16,274
Hey! Come here!

687
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:18,345
Come here...

688
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,114
Shall I tell Abraham sir
that you keep boozing?

689
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:27,568
I deserve this!

690
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:33,241
I'm the only one who hasn't signed on the
complaint to chase you away from here.

691
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,437
I'm not even getting
time to clean the floor.

692
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:37,275
The Independent Candidate"

693
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Badusha, who escaped adventurously from the
molestation allegations that he faced.

694
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,433
Vote for him,
with the mobile phone symbol.

695
00:46:47,434 --> 00:46:48,412
WOW!

696
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:52,711
So she stores your Daddy's liquor in
a shampoo bottle behind the stove?

697
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,703
Does your Mummy know this?
- Yes, but she won't say anything.

698
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:57,110
Why?
- If she's drunk,

699
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:59,773
that aunty cleans the
floor thrice a day!

700
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:06,104
How much does a parrot cost?

701
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:08,246
Don't hesitate to quote a price.

702
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,570
You work at this shop, right?

703
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:11,645
Yes.

704
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,007
Then tell me, how much
does a parrot cost?

705
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,099
Well..

706
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,547
If it's a local parrot, we're not supposed
to raise it or put it in a cage now.

707
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:21,768
How much does this cost?

708
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:25,377
That's a cockatiel.
Do you want it alone, or as a pair?

709
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:27,799
How much does this one cost?

710
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,133
That's a Lorie.

711
00:47:29,134 --> 00:47:30,636
Someone has already booked her.

712
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,078
This one..

713
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,969
How much do these cost?

714
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:35,433
This is an Australian.

715
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:37,266
If you buy a single one...

716
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:38,439
What about this one?

717
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,241
If you keep asking for
prices, what can I do?

718
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:42,371
Decide which one you want.
- Oh no! They are back!

719
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:44,640
Is that your son?
- No!

720
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,748
But I came here to fulfil
a desire of my son.

721
00:47:54,267 --> 00:47:55,575
He wants a parrot.

722
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,702
This is a Macaw.

723
00:47:58,067 --> 00:47:59,546
I don't know all that.

724
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:01,440
I think it's this one.

725
00:48:01,734 --> 00:48:03,111
This is my son.

726
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:08,276
Are you buying a parrot to
fulfil this son's desire?

727
00:48:08,334 --> 00:48:09,608
How much does it cost?

728
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:13,305
Around 1.5 Lakhs.

729
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,738
Let me think about it.

730
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,277
What are you thinking, sir?

731
00:48:20,034 --> 00:48:22,173
How many flexes did you print?

732
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,070
What about posters?
- 3000.

733
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:28,610
And they have stuck around 2000
black <i>&</i> white posters outside.

734
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:30,747
Since I thought the photo
in it wasn't so good,

735
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,771
I went right away to Shivakashi
and got all this done.

736
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:36,412
How is it, sir?

737
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:38,504
They asked me if you
were a movie star!

738
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,366
When I said that you're an
advocate, they were shocked!

739
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:41,607
'Asv': Jimmy'

740
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,577
What is this Asv and two dots?

741
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:45,405
Asv?
When did this change?

742
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,707
Shall we change it?
- Huh? What?

743
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,433
What if we print 'D'
instead of 'SV'?

744
00:48:50,434 --> 00:48:53,266
Then we'll place that 'D' below
your photo, or along with that 'A'.

745
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:55,611
Just tell us where to put it.
- Put it somewhere!

746
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,576
And strengthen the campaign!

747
00:48:57,634 --> 00:48:58,738
The photo is okay!

748
00:48:59,067 --> 00:49:00,603
Or else, glamour would
have been a problem.

749
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:02,246
Is this a beauty contest?

750
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,599
Sir, don't say that.

751
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,047
There are many neutral women here.
They don't have any parties or politics.

752
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,770
Towards the candidates, women
should feel a kind of love!

753
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,447
Yes. With a helmet <i>&</i> sun glass,
you'll look dapper.

754
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:18,499
Sir, it's not just that.
The photo is not enough.

755
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,411
What can we do to
capture these women?

756
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:23,138
Let the cases of you capturing
women get done first.

757
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,474
Moral police, it seems.

758
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,740
The trend is in our favour,
but we should be active on social media.

759
00:49:28,734 --> 00:49:33,274
Shall I tell you an innovative campaign
method, that no one has used yet?

760
00:49:33,434 --> 00:49:34,412
Yes. Tell me.

761
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:38,372
What if we make a parody song
with your name and the symbol?

762
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:41,204
Good.
- Thank you.

763
00:49:41,267 --> 00:49:42,678
What a fresh idea!

764
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:46,545
Ready!

765
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:56,448
Who was the one who gave
computers to UP Schools?

766
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,604
Who was the one who laid
tiles for the waiting shed?

767
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,746
Who was the one who held an
eye treatment camp here?

768
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:10,976
Shall we go for a take?
- That would be great!

769
00:50:11,434 --> 00:50:14,132
Sir, just be careful about
the rhythm a little.

770
00:50:14,133 --> 00:50:15,544
It's okay"
But still...

771
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:17,409
I've been out of touch
for a long time now..

772
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,508
That's why!
- Let's see!

773
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:20,745
Take!
- Come on.

774
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:25,338
Sir, you have a call.
- Who is it?

775
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,978
“Day PA!

776
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,508
Oh! Udayan PA!

777
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,678
I'm coming.

778
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,978
Both are the same.

779
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,578
Here.

780
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,746
Hello Udayetta" - Kalesh, an
elephant has gone berserk here.

781
00:50:42,634 --> 00:50:43,612
Come here quickly.

782
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:47,615
Look how he's running!

783
00:50:52,234 --> 00:50:54,771
Hey! We should make use of
this opportunity. - How?

784
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,399
We should spread the news that this
mad elephant came for his campaign.

785
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,074
Don't keep running around
<i>&</i> tame this elephant!

786
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,081
This one has 2 GB RAM
and a 64-bit processor.

787
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:12,608
And 16 GB internal memory..
- 10 megapixel front cam...

788
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:14,305
And a selfie stick
comes free with it.

789
00:51:19,634 --> 00:51:20,612
Where have you reached?

790
00:51:20,767 --> 00:51:23,299
That Jimmy is trying to blame
us for the elephant going mad.

791
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,278
How's that possible?

792
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,746
It's your symbol that
has gone berserk here.

793
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:28,412
Get here quickly.

794
00:51:31,234 --> 00:51:32,212
Move!

795
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:35,540
Sir, why don't we just
call the fire force?

796
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,773
Should we go there?
- I must go there.

797
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:40,706
Drive fast, man!

798
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,766
In Andhra Pradesh,

799
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,180
an election was postponed because a
candidate was killed by an elephant.

800
00:51:50,133 --> 00:51:52,135
Decrease the speed a bit, then.

801
00:51:53,567 --> 00:51:54,602
Oh no!
Mom!

802
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:57,466
Get up, you!

803
00:51:57,467 --> 00:51:58,673
What nonsense are you doing?

804
00:51:58,734 --> 00:52:00,714
<i>Get out'.
- Dam send me away, Check“.</i>

805
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:02,144
Please, Chechi..
- Leave him.

806
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,407
Let him stay there.
Elephants don't care about six packs!

807
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:06,766
No! No one has been injured yet.

808
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:08,576
Two people are stuck
atop the elephant.

809
00:52:12,334 --> 00:52:13,312
Stop!

810
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:15,574
Can you run fast with these weights?
Drop it <i>&</i> run!

811
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:20,004
Throw those weights on
to that jockey fellow!

812
00:52:20,434 --> 00:52:22,243
Sir, got the number of
the elephants owner.

813
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,502
Does he know to give
a sedation shot?

814
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:27,410
I don't know.
Try calling him.

815
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,747
The number you're trying to reach,
is currently switched off.

816
00:52:34,634 --> 00:52:36,113
The call is not going through?

817
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,278
It's switched off.

818
00:52:45,034 --> 00:52:46,980
'Don't come from behind, and kiss me'

819
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,543
There's a policy where the family gets 10
Lakhs if you're killed by an elephant.

820
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,778
Shall I explain?

821
00:53:06,634 --> 00:53:08,705
It's better to get killed by that
elephant than to listen to this".

822
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,533
Oh Lord!
Save us!

823
00:53:12,534 --> 00:53:15,242
The number you're trying to reach,
is currently switched off.

824
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:21,546
The elephant ran
into the temple.

825
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,375
We're searching for someone
to give a sedation shot.

826
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:25,607
We're safely staying away, sir.

827
00:53:29,267 --> 00:53:31,247
I hope I get a good call first.

828
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:45,045
It's engaged.

829
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:46,746
Was he killed by the elephant?

830
00:53:49,367 --> 00:53:51,099
Dear voters,

831
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:55,446
To enjoy the sight of giving a
sedation shot to the mad elephant...

832
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,343
that's out to destroy our town,

833
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:02,266
Kalesh, who uses his own
symbol to trample the townsmen...

834
00:54:02,267 --> 00:54:05,009
Condemn his sweet talks!

835
00:54:05,067 --> 00:54:09,166
Understand the love and affection
Advocate Jim my has towards this town.

836
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:11,613
Coconut tree is our symbol.
Jimmy is our coconut tree!

837
00:54:12,134 --> 00:54:13,306
Superb arrival!

838
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,711
The people are all frightened.
We have to start action immediately.

839
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,080
Kalesh, the guy who
came is a Christian.

840
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:33,608
Let's play a game with that!

841
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,045
Now you drive fast!

842
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:44,233
It doesn't matter that I'm
the elephanfs owner.

843
00:54:44,234 --> 00:54:46,599
If something happens to the
elephant, I won't even get bail.

844
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,699
I'll take care of all that.

845
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,112
He is a licensed
veterinarian doctor.

846
00:54:50,434 --> 00:54:53,278
Only because his hand is broken,
we're asking you to do this.

847
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,333
Is it?

848
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,575
I can't give permission for
chemical restraint just like that.

849
00:54:56,634 --> 00:54:59,080
We need a doctor who has
an insurance of 10 Lakhs,

850
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:01,135
or a policeman who has
undergone firing practice.

851
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,746
Here he is!
- No way!

852
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,111
If someone complaints that I did something
I don't know, it will be severe case.

853
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:09,613
These voter fools don't know all that!

854
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,703
Just do as I say"
- Not possible. I can't do it.

855
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,280
What happened to your hand?
- I went to pluck a mango.

856
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,508
Hold this.
Come on!

857
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,177
Don't be scared, Chetta.

858
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,479
They are coming!

859
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,678
Where are you going?

860
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,235
Madam (Elephanfs madness)

861
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,405
Matham (Religion)
That's the problem here.

862
00:55:42,433 --> 00:55:45,539
Jimmy sir, why did you provoke that
poor elephant that was staying silent?

863
00:55:46,767 --> 00:55:50,133
After creating all this ruckus,
you're trying to frame me for that?

864
00:55:50,134 --> 00:55:52,614
In our constituency where 60%
of the voters are Hindus,

865
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:54,599
you chased an elephant
into the temple!

866
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,241
The devotees here won't allow someone from
another religion to enter the temple!

867
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:00,078
We're in trouble!

868
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:02,777
Kalesh, our leader!

869
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,080
<i>What about me?
Don”: be scared, Chem.</i>

870
00:56:05,134 --> 00:56:06,670
Lead us with valour.

871
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:10,044
Kalesh, don't complicate things
by making false allegations.

872
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:13,132
What the hell are you looking at?
Get inside <i>&</i> shoot!

873
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:14,466
We won't let you
enter the temple.

874
00:56:14,467 --> 00:56:15,766
Jimmy sir, our leader!

875
00:56:15,767 --> 00:56:17,212
I want to pee!

876
00:56:18,134 --> 00:56:20,114
Lead us with valour!
- Enough!

877
00:56:20,234 --> 00:56:22,510
Stop it! Come on, stop it!

878
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:24,444
There's no point in shouting!

879
00:56:24,634 --> 00:56:27,342
If a person from another
religion enters this temple,

880
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,244
Kalesh sir will get the votes of all
the Hindus of this constituency.

881
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,474
Kalesh, our leader!

882
00:56:33,534 --> 00:56:37,333
Stop arguing over there and
come and save us, you leaders!

883
00:56:37,334 --> 00:56:38,312
Stop it!

884
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,071
You want to know which
religion he belongs to, right?

885
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,611
For that, just remove his shirt.
We'll know then.

886
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,633
Sir, no!
- Remove it.

887
00:56:48,634 --> 00:56:50,238
Take it off!
- Kalesh, leave him.

888
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,099
Remove your shirt <i>&</i> show him.
- I won't!

889
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,080
Don't humiliate me in front of people!

890
00:56:54,267 --> 00:56:55,466
Remove it!
- No!

891
00:56:55,467 --> 00:56:57,504
Kalesh, move.
I'll show you how it's done.

892
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,409
Don't do it!
- Don't take the law in your hands.

893
00:56:59,467 --> 00:57:00,741
Don't remove it.

894
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:17,169
This is not a headphone string!

895
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:19,433
It's a Brahminical sacred thread!

896
00:57:19,434 --> 00:57:23,246
He's the only son of Charthula Vikraman
Namboothiri of Planthula house.

897
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,506
His brother is in the air force.

898
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,411
It's a sacred thread!

899
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,273
Now, may I enter?

900
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,243
Jimmy sir, our leader!
Lakhs are behind you!

901
00:57:38,334 --> 00:57:39,540
Send him in.

902
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,638
Jimmy sir, our leader!
Lakhs are behind you!

903
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,578
Move away.

904
00:57:45,434 --> 00:57:48,278
Jimmy is our real leader!
- Move!

905
00:57:57,567 --> 00:58:00,299
Shoot where it can't pluck
it off with its trunk.

906
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,779
I know!

907
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:35,439
I'm scared of injections!

908
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:40,743
<i>Don“: be scared, Chem'.!</i>

909
00:58:48,767 --> 00:58:51,407
It's like 'A mole on
top of a hunchback'.

910
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:54,976
The old saying 'Fell sick during bad
times' is more suitable, right? - Yes.

911
00:58:55,034 --> 00:58:56,099
Shut up!

912
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,979
Didn't you say that communalism has
a huge market? And to tap into it?

913
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:02,245
You haven't forgotten
about the bet, right mom?

914
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,735
What a question!

915
00:59:04,233 --> 00:59:06,338
Will any mother forget
something about her son?

916
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:08,611
Them?

917
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:11,613
Both of them have placed bets
that I'll lose in the election.

918
00:59:12,434 --> 00:59:13,412
Kalesh,

919
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:17,137
you know very well that we didn't
place bets for you to lose.

920
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:20,577
Your father was the MLA
here for 14 years.

921
00:59:21,234 --> 00:59:24,078
And everyone here used
to like him a lot.

922
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:29,275
Didn't everyone say that you won because of
the sympathy wave of your father's death?

923
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:30,737
But it's not like that.

924
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,771
It's because of their
love for your father.

925
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,540
There's something I realized
while living with him;

926
00:59:36,767 --> 00:59:40,214
the people of Kerala don't vote
based on religion or caste.

927
00:59:42,633 --> 00:59:43,611
True!

928
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,745
Is he inside?
- Yes. - Come.

929
00:59:50,234 --> 00:59:51,799
Are you all doing good?
- Yes. Come in.

930
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,245
All are here?
- Come in.

931
00:59:53,334 --> 00:59:54,438
Don't you know them all?

932
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,480
This is Kalesh's wife, Chitra.

933
00:59:56,567 --> 00:59:57,671
Do you sing?
- No.

934
00:59:57,734 --> 01:00:00,078
You've grown fatter than how
you were during your wedding.

935
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:01,703
No. That's because
of this Churidar.

936
01:00:01,767 --> 01:00:04,247
<i>What do you want to think?
Tea er Mae'!?</i>

937
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,768
Anything is fine.

938
01:00:11,267 --> 01:00:12,799
This house, how many
square feet is it?

939
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,336
Only Naseer knows that.

940
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:16,638
Does he call from Dubai?
- Once in a while.

941
01:00:17,334 --> 01:00:21,111
He stays at a sharing apartment
in Karama with some Sri Lankan.

942
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,740
This Sri Lankan has built a much
bigger house in his home town.

943
01:00:25,767 --> 01:00:28,407
I was invited for this house-warming,
but I couldn't come.

944
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,545
Is the elephant problem solved?

945
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,001
That's solved.

946
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,199
It belongs to that pet-house
owner I told you about.

947
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,178
Oh! You're here?

948
01:00:36,434 --> 01:00:38,505
Shall I bring the tea here?
- No. We'll come there.

949
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,412
The house used to stay in;
is it locked?

950
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,136
No. I have rented it out.

951
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:47,299
In today's times, houses
shouldn't be rented out at all.

952
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,733
They won't pay the rent on time,
and ruin the house as well..

953
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,577
And they won't vacate
when we ask them to!

954
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:55,299
But the one staying in
Kalesh sir's house,

955
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,405
well mannered, cultured
and a puritan!

956
01:00:58,133 --> 01:00:59,510
Who is he?
- Me!

957
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,579
They don't anything made at home.
But if it's from outside, they'll eat.

958
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:09,232
Kids these days are like that.

959
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:10,233
Yes.

960
01:01:10,234 --> 01:01:12,236
It's not because of the Churidar.
You've grown fat.

961
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:14,406
Why don't you try Zumba dance?

962
01:01:15,734 --> 01:01:17,714
True. I also felt so.
- Ya right!

963
01:01:18,267 --> 01:01:20,299
Now don't say that I
didn't invite you.

964
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,611
On the coming Sunday, it's her first
Holy Communion at the Church.

965
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,078
That's awesome.

966
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,180
All of you should come.
There's a small party in the evening.

967
01:01:28,233 --> 01:01:30,406
You don't need a special card,
right Udayan? You'll come, right?

968
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:32,504
24th, right?
I will never forget!

969
01:01:33,234 --> 01:01:34,212
You should come.

970
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,205
Uncle, whom are you
painting this for'?

971
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:52,073
Your sister will get a lot
of gifts today, right?

972
01:01:52,367 --> 01:01:55,132
Like that, this cage is a
gift I have to give someone.

973
01:01:55,133 --> 01:01:56,476
The new phone is nice.

974
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,246
Don't play around with
it <i>&</i> reduce its charge.

975
01:01:59,334 --> 01:02:01,336
This phone's charge
lasts really long.

976
01:02:01,434 --> 01:02:03,573
It has a 3000 mAh battery.

977
01:02:04,467 --> 01:02:06,003
Pull it!
- Okay.

978
01:02:06,633 --> 01:02:08,374
Why are you here?

979
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:10,436
A tea party is happening
at your house, right?

980
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,741
No one takes me along for
anything because I'm a child.

981
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:16,305
Children can do many things
that adults can't do!

982
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,478
You're able to stay
happy always, right? - Yes.

983
01:02:21,434 --> 01:02:24,608
Do you know which bird
can fly backwards?

984
01:02:25,234 --> 01:02:26,212
No.

985
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:28,112
Shall I tell you?

986
01:02:28,234 --> 01:02:29,577
The cuckoo that drinks honey.

987
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,974
It goes forward and drinks
honey & then comes backward.

988
01:02:33,067 --> 01:02:35,666
Again it goes forward,
and then comes backward.

989
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:36,766
And it keeps going and"

990
01:02:36,767 --> 01:02:38,713
Give me that mobile.
Now get going.

991
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,138
One minute, please.

992
01:02:46,434 --> 01:02:47,412
Come here.

993
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:55,405
A friend of mine,
has that 'one'!

994
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,273
Will be able to sell it for us?

995
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,566
I'll get you a good commission.

996
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,274
The item is in Wayanad now.

997
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,578
What?

998
01:03:02,733 --> 01:03:03,734
Barn Owl
(Silver owl)

999
01:03:04,467 --> 01:03:06,132
Take it only if you
like the colour.

1000
01:03:06,133 --> 01:03:08,010
It looks like it's
painted with silver.

1001
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,009
We haven't met, okay?

1002
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,278
Well" Just one..

1003
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:13,545
Variety colour...

1004
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:17,213
I told him to buy it only if he likes
the colour; still he doesn't want?

1005
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:32,980
Respected Vaikkom Municipal Court
OS No. 11312017...

1006
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,511
Judgement on the complaint
filed by petitioner Abraham.

1007
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:41,238
According to the 444th section
of the Municipality act of 1994,

1008
01:03:41,534 --> 01:03:44,777
the farm that has hindered the
peaceful habitat of the neighbours,

1009
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,537
should be shifted to a different
place within 15 days,

1010
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:53,243
according to the 33rd judgment and 1st
rule of the civil procedure code of 1908.

1011
01:07:48,467 --> 01:07:51,533
How old is the girl whose Holy
Communion happened yesterday?

1012
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:52,569
I don't know, sir.

1013
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,374
How many workers were there?

1014
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:56,503
Five..
- Four, sir..

1015
01:07:56,634 --> 01:07:58,272
Five or foul'? Say the truth..
- 5.

1016
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:00,766
How many from other states?
- One, sir.

1017
01:08:00,767 --> 01:08:02,337
How many?
- One.

1018
01:08:02,534 --> 01:08:04,775
Bring all your ID proofs.
- Okay.

1019
01:08:06,334 --> 01:08:09,144
The police will ask a lot of
crooked questions, back and forth.

1020
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:12,304
You should only say that you're
not friendly with our neighbour,

1021
01:08:12,367 --> 01:08:13,573
and you don't go there.

1022
01:08:17,434 --> 01:08:18,412
Whoever it is,

1023
01:08:18,767 --> 01:08:20,576
this was a bit too much!

1024
01:08:22,134 --> 01:08:24,011
Must be someone with a
grudge against him.

1025
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,136
What's gone is gone!

1026
01:08:32,367 --> 01:08:33,345
Hey!

1027
01:08:34,134 --> 01:08:35,408
What the hell?

1028
01:08:36,467 --> 01:08:39,243
My parrot worth 1.5
Lakhs was stolen!

1029
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:40,599
1.5 Lakhs for a parrot?

1030
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,705
It's not an ordinary parrot.
It's a Macaw.

1031
01:08:42,767 --> 01:08:44,405
Macaw?
- Do you know something?

1032
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:45,678
See.

1033
01:08:45,734 --> 01:08:49,511
Last evening, to paint this cage, I
shifted the parrot that was in it,

1034
01:08:49,767 --> 01:08:52,111
to this cage here.

1035
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,702
It was stolen from here.

1036
01:08:54,067 --> 01:08:56,240
Sir, I was going to sell it to someone.

1037
01:08:56,334 --> 01:08:58,336
You should find it
for me somehow.

1038
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:00,407
Do you suspect anyone?

1039
01:09:02,467 --> 01:09:03,741
Here's the full amount.

1040
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,978
Okay.
- Bye.

1041
01:09:06,667 --> 01:09:09,773
Some gentlemen are hell bent on
chasing me away from here, right?

1042
01:09:10,134 --> 01:09:11,374
I suspect all of them!

1043
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:15,308
Get me wheat gruel!

1044
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,570
Sir, I need it back!

1045
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:18,544
I had kept it apart to
sell it to someone.

1046
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:20,510
Calm down.
We'll figure out something.

1047
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,104
Sir, there's information that a
parrot was found in a house nearby.

1048
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,078
Come on!

1049
01:09:26,134 --> 01:09:27,408
Mission Macaw is on!

1050
01:09:36,734 --> 01:09:38,236
Sir, follow me!

1051
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,433
Let's find the parrot!

1052
01:09:39,434 --> 01:09:40,799
Are you the cop here, or me?

1053
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,778
Follow me!

1054
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,041
The parrot is inside.

1055
01:09:50,134 --> 01:09:52,580
Who took you into the police, sir'?

1056
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:57,205
What is this, sir?

1057
01:09:58,067 --> 01:09:59,171
Who else is here?

1058
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,674
My husband.
He is taking bath.

1059
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:02,345
At this time?

1060
01:10:03,201 --> 01:10:04,339
We need to search this house.

1061
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:06,414
There's a Macaw missing case.

1062
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:09,070
I don't have anything to do
with Mecartin, sir. - Sir...

1063
01:10:10,067 --> 01:10:11,366
Sir, come..

1064
01:10:11,367 --> 01:10:12,345
Move.

1065
01:10:13,734 --> 01:10:15,475
Don't interrupt his bath, sir.

1066
01:10:16,167 --> 01:10:17,578
What is it?
- Look!

1067
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,611
How did this Macaw reach here?

1068
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,304
Isn't that a parrot?

1069
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,674
I asked you how it reached here!

1070
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,137
Yesterday was our
wedding anniversary.

1071
01:10:29,201 --> 01:10:31,772
So my husband gave this
parrot as a gift to me!

1072
01:10:32,234 --> 01:10:35,306
To gift you a parrot, who's your husband?
Saudi Sultan?

1073
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,306
Then who is he?

1074
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,378
Look!

1075
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,639
24th, right?
I will never forget it!

1076
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,078
Walk"

1077
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:49,145
Sir..

1078
01:10:49,234 --> 01:10:50,645
What?
- This is MLA Kalesh's house.

1079
01:10:50,734 --> 01:10:52,066
MLA, right?

1080
01:10:52,067 --> 01:10:54,604
I was transferred here for cussing at
a minister who threw stones at dogs!

1081
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,647
Sir, I'm the MLA's PA.
- Understood.

1082
01:10:56,734 --> 01:10:59,044
PA.
Parrot Abd ucto r, rig ht?

1083
01:10:59,334 --> 01:11:00,333
Get into the car!

1084
01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:02,746
Mission Macaw is completed!

1085
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,638
It's just a parrot, rig ht?

1086
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:07,144
And he got it back as well.

1087
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:10,099
Since an FIR hasn't been made,
don't charge a case.

1088
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,204
The case should be charged!

1089
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:14,073
Friend, it came in on its own.
I didn't steal it.

1090
01:11:14,134 --> 01:11:15,112
Is that true?

1091
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,612
I saw him taking
something from the car.

1092
01:11:16,734 --> 01:11:19,112
I thought he was packing a
bottle and taking it with him.

1093
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:24,299
If you give in writing that you have no
complaint, the problem will be solved now.

1094
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,278
What say?

1095
01:11:25,367 --> 01:11:29,577
I've received a letter from the court to
vacate the place where I'm staying now.

1096
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:33,045
If all of you find a solution to it,

1097
01:11:33,467 --> 01:11:35,777
I will think about
withdrawing the complaint.

1098
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,081
Do you know whom you
are talking to?

1099
01:11:41,034 --> 01:11:42,536
I also know a little
about the law.

1100
01:11:43,034 --> 01:11:45,105
Even though you're staying
in a different house,

1101
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,210
aren't you the owner of the house
where the stolen item was found?

1102
01:11:48,434 --> 01:11:50,107
The culprit is your manager, right?

1103
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,170
Election is coming soon.

1104
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,405
If people know this, it
will be a disgrace for you!

1105
01:11:55,067 --> 01:11:57,240
Hey! Don't think you
can threaten me!

1106
01:11:57,501 --> 01:11:58,673
The house has a rent receipt.

1107
01:11:58,801 --> 01:12:01,975
And if you're planning to send
Udayan Chettan to jail in this case,

1108
01:12:02,034 --> 01:12:03,172
I care a damn!

1109
01:12:03,267 --> 01:12:05,577
He is just a worker of mine!

1110
01:12:05,667 --> 01:12:09,137
You should take the position of
my deceased father, and bless me.

1111
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,278
What's the noise here?

1112
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,378
All are here, huh?

1113
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:20,142
Is it some conspiracy
against Jimmy sir'?

1114
01:12:21,434 --> 01:12:23,573
Sir, please change the
date of this mic sanction.

1115
01:13:14,034 --> 01:13:15,741
I was shocked when I saw this.

1116
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,037
No one else needs to
know that Chitra did it.

1117
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,471
I sent it to the
neighbour uncle.

1118
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,978
Which uncle?

1119
01:15:08,434 --> 01:15:10,414
Are you staying at the
police station now?

1120
01:15:10,634 --> 01:15:12,045
I'm not staying there"

1121
01:15:12,101 --> 01:15:13,133
Then?

1122
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,545
I go there just to feed them.

1123
01:15:28,434 --> 01:15:29,674
The funeral is at 3 PM, right?

1124
01:15:29,767 --> 01:15:32,233
Imagine the condition of that little girl..
- Poor thing.

1125
01:15:32,234 --> 01:15:33,645
Will that girl's mother come back?

1126
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,078
No. She married someone
else and went abroad.

1127
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,641
My son had a romantic relationship which
lasted only until they got married.

1128
01:16:16,134 --> 01:16:18,273
After the marriage, the
romance was all gone!

1129
01:16:19,634 --> 01:16:24,606
Though she loved him, she wasn't
able to adjust to his surroundings"

1130
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:28,343
There are no attached bathrooms at home.
No signal for mobile...

1131
01:16:28,767 --> 01:16:31,247
So such small problems
became really big gradually.

1132
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:35,477
And when they had a child, the
facilities weren't enough for her.

1133
01:16:36,234 --> 01:16:37,600
If so..
- Hey!

1134
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:39,239
Where is Abraham sir's house?

1135
01:16:40,134 --> 01:16:41,477
That one.
- Okay.

1136
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:44,037
Don't you have
wife and children?

1137
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:45,245
No.

1138
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,674
That's good in a way.

1139
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,577
You just need to live
for your own wishes.

1140
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:52,740
I need a lot of money
to renovate the house.

1141
01:16:53,467 --> 01:16:56,710
When he got a job at a chemical
company in Jaipur, he went there.

1142
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,410
This is a photo he took
at some exhibition there.

1143
01:17:07,167 --> 01:17:10,341
Ever since she saw this photo,
my granddaughter was adamant...

1144
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,766
...that she wants a parrot like this.

1145
01:17:12,767 --> 01:17:14,144
I'll pay the rest later.

1146
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,736
There's 30,000 Rupees in this.

1147
01:17:16,034 --> 01:17:17,012
Accept this,

1148
01:17:17,767 --> 01:17:19,303
and give me that parrot.

1149
01:17:21,267 --> 01:17:24,077
It's the last wish of
my son who's no more!

1150
01:17:25,067 --> 01:17:28,276
She is waiting at home, waiting for
her father to bring her the parrot.

1151
01:17:29,067 --> 01:17:30,205
It's for his daughter"

1152
01:17:31,601 --> 01:17:33,239
You should give me this parrot.

1153
01:17:35,634 --> 01:17:37,238
My son is gone!

1154
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:39,639
How do I bear this!

1155
01:17:40,034 --> 01:17:42,640
He went there because I didn't
have money to renovate the house.

1156
01:18:00,067 --> 01:18:02,013
Uncle, whom are you
painting this for'?

1157
01:18:02,067 --> 01:18:04,547
Your sister will get a lot
of gifts today, right?

1158
01:18:05,234 --> 01:18:07,714
Like that, this cage
is a gift for someone.

1159
01:18:13,534 --> 01:18:14,672
Such a nice dog!

1160
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:26,645
What is it, deal'?

1161
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,678
Hey!

1162
01:18:30,734 --> 01:18:33,681
Are you running a police
station there, or a zoo?

1163
01:18:34,634 --> 01:18:36,238
Sorry madam..
- What sorry?

1164
01:18:36,767 --> 01:18:39,304
I'll shift all the animals
from here as soon as possible.

1165
01:18:39,367 --> 01:18:40,345
Stop it!

1166
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,040
Didn't he submit all the documents
and the license for them?

1167
01:18:43,334 --> 01:18:44,404
Yes! Yes!

1168
01:18:44,467 --> 01:18:47,266
Those animal protection authority
people left them and went away!

1169
01:18:47,267 --> 01:18:50,578
The court order is to shift them
from the place he's staying in.

1170
01:18:51,167 --> 01:18:53,100
I told him to take them away
from there, madam.

1171
01:18:53,101 --> 01:18:54,478
- Then what?
- But..

1172
01:18:54,767 --> 01:18:57,611
Don't bit there..
Don't bite my ear, darling"

1173
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:02,080
I'm on duty! Don't fool around"
- Nonsense!

1174
01:19:03,434 --> 01:19:05,004
I was talking to her, madam.
Sorry.

1175
01:19:05,067 --> 01:19:07,604
Ask the guardian to take
them all away from there.

1176
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:10,633
He doesn't have any other place
to go, madam. That's why!

1177
01:19:10,634 --> 01:19:11,733
And ya..

1178
01:19:11,734 --> 01:19:14,999
Did you present the guy who tried to
sell the star tortoise, to the court?

1179
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,766
No madam.
That case will be cancelled.

1180
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:17,766
Why?

1181
01:19:17,767 --> 01:19:19,433
It was an ordinary tortoise.

1182
01:19:19,434 --> 01:19:22,574
He painted it, made it into a star
tortoise <i>&</i> tried to sell it to an Arab.

1183
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:24,337
That's why I caught him.

1184
01:19:25,434 --> 01:19:27,436
All the cases you get, are like this!

1185
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,707
Don't kiss there.
Don't kiss!

1186
01:19:29,767 --> 01:19:32,407
Stop tickling me, you devil!

1187
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,046
Gaadha, is the wheat over?
- It's there, sir.

1188
01:19:40,134 --> 01:19:42,546
I heard that he has many
more animals with him.

1189
01:19:50,034 --> 01:19:52,571
Sir, buy some carrot for this!

1190
01:19:52,767 --> 01:19:54,440
I woke up at 5.30
in the morning!

1191
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,274
To wake up at 5.30, who are you?
The head priest of Guruvayur?

1192
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:58,608
I'll throw this lathi on you!

1193
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:02,147
He's not lying, sir. Around 5.30-6, all
these roosters started crowing,

1194
01:20:02,201 --> 01:20:03,509
<i>&</i> no one could sleep.

1195
01:20:04,334 --> 01:20:07,508
Can you see 2 horses standing in front?
- No. - Then stop!

1196
01:20:07,767 --> 01:20:09,678
I can't see anything because
of the palm leaves.

1197
01:20:10,034 --> 01:20:12,036
Hey! Move!
Come on!

1198
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,578
Move!

1199
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,343
Come on in..
Come on.

1200
01:20:17,434 --> 01:20:19,778
Where?
- Turn right, man!

1201
01:20:20,434 --> 01:20:23,574
The CI shouldn't know that we cut
the palm leaves from his house!

1202
01:20:23,667 --> 01:20:25,078
We'll be jailed.

1203
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:29,376
Please give me a hand"

1204
01:20:29,434 --> 01:20:31,471
Go and help him!
- Okay sir.

1205
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:35,375
'People-friendly' became
'Animal-friendly' police now.

1206
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,478
Eat it..

1207
01:20:43,434 --> 01:20:44,412
Chetta!

1208
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:46,738
Can you me a hair from
the elephanfs tail?

1209
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:48,112
Why?

1210
01:20:48,167 --> 01:20:49,441
To get rid of my fear"

1211
01:20:49,567 --> 01:20:51,604
Let me see..
- No need.

1212
01:20:51,734 --> 01:20:54,442
Already no one's
afraid of the police..

1213
01:20:55,167 --> 01:20:57,340
Well... What's your plan?

1214
01:20:58,367 --> 01:21:00,313
I need to find a suitable place.

1215
01:21:00,367 --> 01:21:02,472
Well..
- Can't you get rid of many of them?

1216
01:21:02,567 --> 01:21:05,070
It's not like buying
a buffalo for meat.

1217
01:21:05,134 --> 01:21:07,740
It's to raise them, right?
Interested people should come for that.

1218
01:21:08,101 --> 01:21:10,479
They won't live even if you fly them away?
- No way!

1219
01:21:10,534 --> 01:21:12,445
Do you have any other
business apart from this?

1220
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,070
Nothing particular".

1221
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:15,111
Why?

1222
01:21:15,534 --> 01:21:18,208
He has animals worth Lakhs, right?

1223
01:21:18,367 --> 01:21:19,345
Isn't it?

1224
01:21:19,467 --> 01:21:21,777
How much should Yesudas
be paid to sing a song?

1225
01:21:24,067 --> 01:21:26,240
I don't know..
- Just make a guess...

1226
01:21:26,767 --> 01:21:29,714
It's Yesudas, right? How much ever
you pay him, it won't be enough.

1227
01:21:30,067 --> 01:21:31,102
If so...

1228
01:21:31,334 --> 01:21:35,282
if Yesudas sings this song sitting at
home, just like that, will he be paid?

1229
01:21:35,334 --> 01:21:36,642
No!

1230
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,408
This is also like that.

1231
01:21:39,467 --> 01:21:41,640
Those who need it, should come
with a desire to buy them.

1232
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:45,479
Or else, as long as they are with me, they
are not income; they are expenditure!

1233
01:21:47,067 --> 01:21:49,069
You don't worry about Yesudas.

1234
01:21:49,567 --> 01:21:51,069
You know KG Marcose?

1235
01:21:51,234 --> 01:21:52,212
He's a friend of mine.

1236
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,574
There's something that people clad in
white should be really careful about.

1237
01:21:58,067 --> 01:21:59,045
Image!

1238
01:21:59,501 --> 01:22:01,412
Geevarghese is not
an ordinary boy!

1239
01:22:01,467 --> 01:22:03,037
He's a Saint!

1240
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:06,433
St. Geevarghese who
proved my innocence.

1241
01:22:06,434 --> 01:22:09,333
If you get a parrot under my car's
seat, shouldn't you tell that to me?

1242
01:22:09,334 --> 01:22:11,099
Well, I thought it got
in there to lay eggs,

1243
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,410
when it couldn't find a
branch to build a nest.

1244
01:22:13,467 --> 01:22:15,276
24th is an unlucky date for me!

1245
01:22:15,334 --> 01:22:18,508
If that video wasn't there, you could've
escaped by framing him for the case.

1246
01:22:20,767 --> 01:22:23,599
Swindle some 200 crores,
and then frame me for that!

1247
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,738
That has a weight to it!

1248
01:22:25,267 --> 01:22:27,247
This is for stealing a parrot.
Sheesh!

1249
01:22:27,301 --> 01:22:28,473
One kick I'll give you...

1250
01:22:28,734 --> 01:22:30,714
Are you happy now?
Why are you silent?

1251
01:22:31,434 --> 01:22:33,744
He wants us to give a space
for him to stay in this house!

1252
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,778
Here?

1253
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,007
Tell him that we'll
give him some money.

1254
01:22:37,167 --> 01:22:39,238
Money and threats work
for humans like us!

1255
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,644
He lives with animals
24*7, why would he care?

1256
01:22:41,734 --> 01:22:44,738
He needs a place to stay with them.
That's why he's asking for this house.

1257
01:22:44,801 --> 01:22:46,500
Even with a grass snake bite,
the supper may get cancelled.

1258
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:48,037
But he doesn't have a grass
snake with him, right?

1259
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,299
Don't get me talking"

1260
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,266
For the time being, we need to
save ourselves from this problem.

1261
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:53,679
Can't you arrange a
house for him on rent?

1262
01:22:53,734 --> 01:22:56,271
It's not as easy as you think,
and he knows that very well.

1263
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,378
Shall we give your house?

1264
01:22:58,067 --> 01:23:00,673
Already there are 100 complaints
because Udayettan is staying there.

1265
01:23:01,734 --> 01:23:03,372
You and your...

1266
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,441
Why are you blaming her alone?

1267
01:23:06,634 --> 01:23:10,013
You also played a part in stranding him
on the road, listening to Abraham right?

1268
01:23:10,067 --> 01:23:12,206
When people request something to me,
what should I...

1269
01:23:12,434 --> 01:23:15,972
The same people blamed you and ran
away when the elephant went berserk.

1270
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:17,741
You would've been trapped
if he wasn't there then.

1271
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:18,779
What?

1272
01:23:19,234 --> 01:23:21,578
Gautham who got hit by the sedation
shot, is still not in his senses.

1273
01:23:21,634 --> 01:23:23,341
You're in your senses, right?
Then listen!

1274
01:23:23,634 --> 01:23:27,138
There's a great trap that will make Kalesh
lose the election, with that fellow.

1275
01:23:27,267 --> 01:23:28,769
So you shouldn't displease him.

1276
01:23:29,267 --> 01:23:32,599
As the wife of someone who was an MLA
for 14 years... - There she goes again!

1277
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,238
I'll give you an idea!

1278
01:23:36,267 --> 01:23:41,012
There's no problem even if he brings a
couple of cats <i>&</i> dogs and stays here.

1279
01:23:41,667 --> 01:23:44,307
If you come here after
losing the election...

1280
01:23:45,134 --> 01:23:47,205
Idiot, who doesn't know
anything about politics!

1281
01:23:48,434 --> 01:23:49,412
You crook!

1282
01:23:49,667 --> 01:23:50,645
Tell me the truth.

1283
01:23:50,767 --> 01:23:53,247
Didn't you do it on purpose to win the bet?
Tell me!

1284
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,245
Say it, dear"

1285
01:23:56,001 --> 01:23:58,174
You won't understand
if I say it, Udayetta.

1286
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,178
Why?
Is it in Chinese?

1287
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:05,233
I'd asked you to stop it when you'd stolen
that scrap seller's weighing balance!

1288
01:24:05,234 --> 01:24:06,212
Say <i>m</i>

1289
01:24:08,467 --> 01:24:10,447
It's been 6 years
since ourwedding...

1290
01:24:11,801 --> 01:24:14,975
You always had your schedules
to keep you busy, Kaleshetta.

1291
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:20,338
I'm sad that I don't have an own
child to raise and pamper"

1292
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:27,206
Jumping walls to get rid of the sorrow
of not having kids, is not a solution.

1293
01:25:47,334 --> 01:25:50,247
Shall we leave?
- Thanks for coming. Good night!

1294
01:26:09,634 --> 01:26:10,612
What's happening?

1295
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:12,145
Gone!

1296
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:14,408
He took all the animals away!

1297
01:26:14,534 --> 01:26:15,774
Good.
Where?

1298
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:07,340
Did Jumbo Circus start
a home delivery?

1299
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:14,071
No one has a problem if 2 or 3 small animals
stay at a corner of the house, right?

1300
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,478
Suffer now!

1301
01:27:15,534 --> 01:27:17,480
She thinks she knows
everything in politics!

1302
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,671
One kick I'll give you!

1303
01:27:25,767 --> 01:27:27,041
Maruthu"
- Tell me, sir..

1304
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:28,602
This is house we're going
to stay in, hereafter.

1305
01:27:28,667 --> 01:27:30,044
Is it good?
- Very good.

1306
01:27:31,234 --> 01:27:32,466
Is he a Tamilian?

1307
01:27:32,467 --> 01:27:35,209
Didn't you understand when he gave so many
troubles to us, that he's a Malayali?

1308
01:27:35,267 --> 01:27:38,339
So many people came to your house <i>&</i> you
didn't even offer a glass of water"

1309
01:27:38,434 --> 01:27:39,606
What's your intention?

1310
01:27:41,134 --> 01:27:42,112
Chechi...

1311
01:27:42,667 --> 01:27:45,614
Do you remember the one sitting
in that vehicle behind?

1312
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,577
Where is my phone?

1313
01:27:55,634 --> 01:27:57,045
Udayetta, where's my phone?

1314
01:27:57,134 --> 01:27:58,340
I'm going away somewhere.

1315
01:27:58,634 --> 01:27:59,633
My Phone!

1316
01:27:59,634 --> 01:28:02,012
MLA sir is really angry, huh?

1317
01:28:02,067 --> 01:28:05,014
When we give you a space to stay,
how can you bring so many animals?

1318
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:06,272
Don't worry..

1319
01:28:06,334 --> 01:28:08,712
They are all very innocent"
They won't cause any trouble.

1320
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,578
Sheesh!

1321
01:28:20,067 --> 01:28:22,377
If I could get some water,
I could wash it off.

1322
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:38,113
Not just these;
boss has many more animals with him.

1323
01:28:39,434 --> 01:28:40,412
With his hand?

1324
01:28:40,534 --> 01:28:42,138
Hey helper..
- What is it, sir'?

1325
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,373
The guy who's collecting dung is your boss?
- Yes sir.

1326
01:28:44,434 --> 01:28:46,141
He's a great man!
Down to earth!

1327
01:28:48,034 --> 01:28:50,071
Horse dung is good manure.
- Take it away!

1328
01:28:50,167 --> 01:28:51,976
The plants will grow very well!

1329
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,637
Oh no! My Italian Henna plant!

1330
01:28:58,434 --> 01:28:59,777
Hey! Hold this!

1331
01:29:03,134 --> 01:29:05,205
Udayettan said that the elephant
would be taken away tomorrow.

1332
01:29:05,267 --> 01:29:08,214
You can click a photo with the
elephant only if you come before noon.

1333
01:29:08,267 --> 01:29:11,976
If I'm coming, I could update on FB
- Rocking with Elephantl!

1334
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,211
But come when Kaleshettan
is not around.

1335
01:29:14,534 --> 01:29:16,673
Then positive thinkers
will come there tomorrow.

1336
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,138
Or else.. Kaleshettan is going
to Delhi this week. Come then!

1337
01:29:21,267 --> 01:29:23,747
To Delhi?
- Ya. He thinks he's the Prime Minister!

1338
01:29:24,467 --> 01:29:26,208
Is your Kaleshettan
still angry at you?

1339
01:29:26,501 --> 01:29:28,105
He's not angry and all..

1340
01:29:28,234 --> 01:29:29,212
It's just a show off.

1341
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,447
He keeps saying that he'll kick me;
but he won't kick me!

1342
01:29:34,334 --> 01:29:35,278
Oh my God!

1343
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,107
You <i>&</i> your bloody chatting!

1344
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,346
I'll put chilli in your eyes!

1345
01:29:41,401 --> 01:29:42,379
Kapish was there?

1346
01:30:20,634 --> 01:30:22,739
Smart one.
He got in.

1347
01:30:23,534 --> 01:30:24,604
Do you know something?

1348
01:30:24,701 --> 01:30:27,700
The only animal in the world which can
bend it's back leg towards the back,

1349
01:30:27,701 --> 01:30:28,679
is the elephant!

1350
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,438
I'm able to do it!

1351
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:33,174
Are you four-legged?
- Let me see.

1352
01:30:33,434 --> 01:30:34,742
Two-legged!
- That's what!

1353
01:30:35,067 --> 01:30:36,239
Tell me the truth..

1354
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,712
Does this elephant
have any problem?

1355
01:30:39,001 --> 01:30:40,981
No.. Why?
- Well...

1356
01:30:41,167 --> 01:30:43,977
I asked because you told
me to take it for free.

1357
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:49,207
A few days after the circus company shut
down, your father called me and told me,

1358
01:30:49,267 --> 01:30:51,975
'Didn't you toil a lot for
this circus company?'

1359
01:30:52,067 --> 01:30:54,638
'But still I haven't
done anything for you'

1360
01:30:55,001 --> 01:30:58,175
And your father gave me this
elephant, with both his eyes moist.

1361
01:30:59,267 --> 01:31:01,645
Your father had a large heart.
- Crap!

1362
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:04,306
You don't know my father very well!

1363
01:31:04,434 --> 01:31:06,675
Who else will buy the elephant
which didn't do anything,

1364
01:31:06,734 --> 01:31:08,680
except playing football
at the circus?

1365
01:31:08,734 --> 01:31:10,077
Not just football"

1366
01:31:10,167 --> 01:31:11,271
It climbs on a stool..

1367
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:13,273
And sits like this!
Hey!

1368
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:15,778
I'm not fooling you like
my father fooled you.

1369
01:31:16,067 --> 01:31:17,239
You quote a price.

1370
01:31:17,401 --> 01:31:20,066
You want to present this elephant
to the Guruvayur temple, right?

1371
01:31:20,067 --> 01:31:21,546
That itself costs a lot!

1372
01:31:22,567 --> 01:31:23,773
From now on,

1373
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:27,110
you can live happily with
Lord Guruvayurappan!

1374
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,306
Donkey?

1375
01:32:10,534 --> 01:32:13,242
How did boss arrange
such a huge house?

1376
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:21,075
There are nutrition
drinks for donkeys, now?

1377
01:32:27,634 --> 01:32:28,612
Eat it!

1378
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,778
Eat it!

1379
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,404
Put on your zip.

1380
01:32:32,634 --> 01:32:34,204
Put on your zip..
- Okay.

1381
01:32:34,267 --> 01:32:35,245
Well..

1382
01:32:35,334 --> 01:32:37,746
What business do you
do with donkeys?

1383
01:32:38,001 --> 01:32:39,742
Exporting and importing
to and from Sabarimala.

1384
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,076
But since there are tractors
now, business is dull.

1385
01:32:42,434 --> 01:32:43,504
Then what will you do?

1386
01:32:43,601 --> 01:32:45,774
We can sell its milk, right?
- Shall I tell you something?

1387
01:32:46,267 --> 01:32:48,747
1 litre donkey milk
costs 6000 Rupees.

1388
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:49,778
What's your name?

1389
01:32:50,001 --> 01:32:51,241
Chitra.
I don't sing.

1390
01:32:51,434 --> 01:32:52,572
But I didn't ask you that...

1391
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:55,777
Didn't you know that it was
alcohol when you drank it?

1392
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,078
No.

1393
01:32:57,234 --> 01:32:58,713
I've never had it earlier, right?

1394
01:33:00,234 --> 01:33:02,271
You don't need a lot of
intelligence to know that.

1395
01:33:02,767 --> 01:33:05,213
This is something that has no
intelligence at all, right?

1396
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:06,678
The donkeys!

1397
01:33:07,301 --> 01:33:11,010
Try keeping one glass of water and one
glass of alcohol in front of it..

1398
01:33:11,101 --> 01:33:13,012
Do you know which one
the donkey will drink?

1399
01:33:13,434 --> 01:33:15,607
Water.
It will drink only water.

1400
01:33:15,767 --> 01:33:17,474
That's why it's called a donkey!

1401
01:33:18,601 --> 01:33:22,139
Do you have any clue that you're doing
all this drama in <i>an</i> MLA's house?

1402
01:33:22,434 --> 01:33:24,573
You became an MLA because
people are stupid, right?

1403
01:33:24,634 --> 01:33:25,612
What?

1404
01:33:25,734 --> 01:33:28,305
I thought it's your livelihood,
let you live somehow..

1405
01:33:28,367 --> 01:33:30,166
But you think you can do any nonsense here?

1406
01:33:30,167 --> 01:33:31,441
When I gave space for a needle...

1407
01:33:31,567 --> 01:33:33,376
This is a house where
humans are living.

1408
01:33:33,434 --> 01:33:34,674
What are you looking at?
And...

1409
01:33:34,767 --> 01:33:37,066
It's not because I'm scared that
you have her video with you..

1410
01:33:37,067 --> 01:33:38,045
My courtesy...

1411
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:41,309
I thought you needn't wander around
with all these animals. Got it?

1412
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:44,573
Move away!

1413
01:33:47,267 --> 01:33:49,533
Don't be scared, sir.
They are the ones who voted for you.

1414
01:33:49,534 --> 01:33:50,740
They will be with you..
- Move!

1415
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:54,408
That guy brought this holy sweet
from the temple. Want it?

1416
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:56,766
I can't find peace
here, Oh Lord Ayyappa!

1417
01:33:56,767 --> 01:33:57,745
Then go!

1418
01:34:05,067 --> 01:34:09,413
I'm asking you if Geevarghese can
send a video from this to someone.

1419
01:34:09,567 --> 01:34:11,233
Kids these days
have shrewd brains.

1420
01:34:11,234 --> 01:34:12,542
We can't say anything!

1421
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:14,408
Well.. What video is it?

1422
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:19,266
Well.. Someone left the tap
open behind the house.

1423
01:34:19,267 --> 01:34:22,111
We lost all the water in the tank.
We want to know who that is.

1424
01:34:25,134 --> 01:34:27,114
Did you drink, Chechi?
- I swear on God, no!

1425
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,578
What's that?

1426
01:34:28,634 --> 01:34:30,580
Don't talk to me about
your busy schedules...

1427
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,299
So bad that you didn't come
for the Holy Communion.

1428
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,041
I had started out to come here.

1429
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:36,799
That's when I got a call saying
that there's a system failure

1430
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,133
at Omega group of companies.

1431
01:34:38,134 --> 01:34:39,272
How can I not go?

1432
01:34:39,401 --> 01:34:42,280
Brother-in-law, say this"
Can this be copied to a phone?

1433
01:34:42,634 --> 01:34:43,612
Yes.

1434
01:34:44,234 --> 01:34:45,770
But it's not so easy.

1435
01:34:46,001 --> 01:34:48,777
The video format has to be
changed and compressed.

1436
01:34:49,267 --> 01:34:50,746
That can also be done!

1437
01:34:51,067 --> 01:34:53,513
Have you put on weight?
- Go inside, I say!

1438
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,409
But I wasn't the one who stole it!

1439
01:34:56,067 --> 01:34:57,045
Stole it?

1440
01:34:57,467 --> 01:35:00,676
The one who left the tap open, took the
bucket & mug which were kept there.

1441
01:35:01,067 --> 01:35:02,239
Tell this to me, bro.

1442
01:35:03,634 --> 01:35:05,705
Technically, no chance!

1443
01:35:05,767 --> 01:35:08,680
Tell me the truth!
Who taught you to lie like this?

1444
01:35:08,734 --> 01:35:10,975
I did this so that that
uncle doesn't go from here.

1445
01:35:11,067 --> 01:35:12,239
You <i>&</i> your uncle!

1446
01:35:16,501 --> 01:35:18,572
Udayetta, take care
of everything here.

1447
01:35:19,101 --> 01:35:22,082
St. Geevarghese hasn't
sent such a video.

1448
01:35:23,767 --> 01:35:24,745
<i>I will</i> finish him today.

1449
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,007
Hey! Let's go home!

1450
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,600
Why is there a crowd here?
- Don't worry, sir.

1451
01:35:39,601 --> 01:35:40,600
I'm not afraid.

1452
01:35:40,601 --> 01:35:43,207
I've heard that the crowd beat up a
candidate to death in Uttarakhand.

1453
01:35:43,267 --> 01:35:46,043
Come. Let's see. - I'll get out
only after I know what's happening.

1454
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,606
What's the matter?

1455
01:35:53,234 --> 01:35:54,212
Put me down!

1456
01:36:04,034 --> 01:36:06,433
Hail... Kalesh!

1457
01:36:06,434 --> 01:36:10,300
I didn't know that MLA made him stay in
his own house, for such a great deed!

1458
01:36:10,301 --> 01:36:11,279
Come on!

1459
01:36:16,301 --> 01:36:21,114
Our town got a liquor shop because
of our Kalesh sir's sacrifice.

1460
01:36:25,201 --> 01:36:27,272
Foreign Liquor Shop

1461
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,409
'Congrats to Kalesh who allowed
a liquor shop in town'

1462
01:36:39,267 --> 01:36:46,583
Every vote for Kalesh!

1463
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:50,172
Every vote for Kalesh!

1464
01:36:50,234 --> 01:36:52,976
That dog-seller is quite sharp-brained.

1465
01:36:53,434 --> 01:36:55,971
Not in black!
Full white!

1466
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,080
That's why I said that
he's intelligent.

1467
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:03,647
He made me transfer it to
an orphanage's account.

1468
01:37:03,801 --> 01:37:07,578
We know, right?
This is to get tax exemption!

1469
01:37:07,767 --> 01:37:12,273
Every vote for Kalesh!

1470
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,106
How many times have you cleaned
the floor today? - I don't know!

1471
01:37:21,301 --> 01:37:23,247
This is such a nuisance!

1472
01:37:23,501 --> 01:37:26,209
Don't say that, Chechi...

1473
01:37:27,101 --> 01:37:29,638
I don't want a policy, man!

1474
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,433
Are you the one who bought this?
- Yes.

1475
01:37:34,434 --> 01:37:36,141
That's my house.
- Are you selling it?

1476
01:37:36,234 --> 01:37:37,611
One slap...
Get lost!

1477
01:37:37,667 --> 01:37:39,146
Tell me and go, man!

1478
01:37:39,234 --> 01:37:41,133
Horse dung and dog-shit
were better than this.

1479
01:37:41,134 --> 01:37:43,774
Can you give me some cold water, Chetta?
- Ya. I'll give you right away!

1480
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,741
Oh my God!
- You bloody...

1481
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:53,342
Things have gone from bad to worse!

1482
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,073
It's a government institution.

1483
01:37:55,234 --> 01:37:57,077
Whom can we complain
to, against it?

1484
01:37:57,134 --> 01:37:58,299
Shall we gather all the women

1485
01:37:58,300 --> 01:38:00,800
<i>&</i> start a procession saying
that it's a residential area?

1486
01:38:00,801 --> 01:38:03,372
If it was a bar, we could have tried"
But this?

1487
01:38:04,367 --> 01:38:06,533
Just calm down thinking
that it's a grocery store!

1488
01:38:06,534 --> 01:38:07,774
You can say all that!

1489
01:38:08,101 --> 01:38:10,775
Once an election is declared,
can a liquor shop be opened?

1490
01:38:11,367 --> 01:38:14,405
An outsider called Eappachan
bought that building.

1491
01:38:14,467 --> 01:38:17,539
Day before the election was
declared, before 5 PM,

1492
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,233
he finished all the paperwork.

1493
01:38:19,234 --> 01:38:20,304
Shouldn't the MLA know that?

1494
01:38:20,367 --> 01:38:22,369
Kalesh is not the ruling
party's MLA, right?

1495
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:26,081
Just because he became the MLA
somehow, due to his father's death"

1496
01:38:26,134 --> 01:38:28,080
What about my request?
- Abraham sir..

1497
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:32,176
Last year, within the nine days of
'Atham' to 'Uthradam' (Onam season),

1498
01:38:32,234 --> 01:38:36,512
Kerala is a state which drank
alcohol worth Rs. 470 Crores.

1499
01:38:36,601 --> 01:38:39,275
We ourselves have given liquor
for several processions.

1500
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:46,414
Till date, no party that has earned the
curse of the alcoholic by banning alcohol,

1501
01:38:46,501 --> 01:38:47,980
has won in the next election!

1502
01:38:49,734 --> 01:38:51,577
Did you understand
everything I said clearly?

1503
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,008
I'll explain in simple words.

1504
01:38:54,067 --> 01:38:56,047
Sir, you are this empty glass.
A

1505
01:38:56,101 --> 01:38:58,081
Under you, three of them!

1506
01:38:58,167 --> 01:39:01,205
B... C... D...

1507
01:39:01,367 --> 01:39:04,439
Only if these three work,
you will get its benefit.

1508
01:39:04,567 --> 01:39:07,633
Would there be any trouble for you
if you get 1 Lakh Rupees per month?

1509
01:39:07,634 --> 01:39:10,166
Vikraman, how deep will
our Panchayat well be?

1510
01:39:10,167 --> 01:39:13,239
Around 14 feet"
- I'm saying it's 18 feet...

1511
01:39:13,334 --> 01:39:14,574
Don't argue!
14 feet!

1512
01:39:14,667 --> 01:39:17,170
Balan Chetta, how deep
is our Panchayat well?

1513
01:39:17,267 --> 01:39:19,247
Around 15-16-17 feet...

1514
01:39:19,301 --> 01:39:20,371
Two cups of tea!
- Right away!

1515
01:39:20,434 --> 01:39:21,538
Chathutti will know.

1516
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,702
Chathutti hasn't
even seen the well.

1517
01:39:24,767 --> 01:39:25,768
An argument.

1518
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,243
Chathutti, how many feet
deep is our Panchayat well?

1519
01:39:29,667 --> 01:39:32,079
Around 19-20 feet"
- That much?

1520
01:39:32,134 --> 01:39:34,546
Get us two Dosas as well.
- Okay.

1521
01:39:49,767 --> 01:39:51,610
The Chechi of that house, right?

1522
01:39:53,567 --> 01:39:56,241
I heard that you have some video of hers.
Can you show it to me?

1523
01:39:56,434 --> 01:39:59,608
Hey! It's not the kind of
video you're expecting!

1524
01:40:06,567 --> 01:40:08,638
Hello Uncle!
It's me, Geevarghese..

1525
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,241
Tell me..
How are you doing?

1526
01:40:11,367 --> 01:40:13,347
When are you coming
here again, uncle?

1527
01:40:13,434 --> 01:40:15,744
You come here once to see uncle.

1528
01:40:16,034 --> 01:40:17,411
Daddy won't allow me.

1529
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:20,579
Next time you ask,
Daddy will allow you..

1530
01:40:28,234 --> 01:40:29,212
What is this?

1531
01:40:29,267 --> 01:40:31,100
Jumping walls?
- Can't he get up?

1532
01:40:31,101 --> 01:40:32,478
Is tea shop a place to sleep?

1533
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,637
He is Elam akkara
Tham bi Chettan's son"

1534
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:36,477
He was a smart young man..

1535
01:40:36,534 --> 01:40:39,413
Now he's sleeping 24 hours a day!
Hey!

1536
01:40:40,101 --> 01:40:41,512
I'm scared of injections!

1537
01:40:42,634 --> 01:40:44,238
The toilet is over there.

1538
01:40:44,301 --> 01:40:46,611
Chetta, how high is
that aeroplane flying?

1539
01:40:46,667 --> 01:40:47,645
That's 30,000 feet.

1540
01:40:47,734 --> 01:40:48,712
35,000 feet.

1541
01:40:48,767 --> 01:40:51,304
Come.. Let's go..
- Let them make a decision..

1542
01:40:51,567 --> 01:40:55,174
If you wait for them to make a decision,
we would be in trouble!

1543
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,638
Don't look back!

1544
01:40:57,767 --> 01:40:59,747
They have started!
- They will finish it as well..

1545
01:41:04,367 --> 01:41:06,608
This Delhi trip wasn't part
of the plan earlier, right?

1546
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,233
Delhi was there...

1547
01:41:09,234 --> 01:41:10,736
Just that I didn't tell you..

1548
01:41:11,601 --> 01:41:13,774
The strike is from 6 AM to 6 PM.

1549
01:41:14,601 --> 01:41:16,444
That's why I asked
you to come early.

1550
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,708
We could have informed the police.

1551
01:41:21,134 --> 01:41:23,444
No! The police needn't
know about this trip..

1552
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,143
Not for you, sir...

1553
01:41:25,301 --> 01:41:27,577
It's for our protection while coming back.
- Yes.

1554
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:30,102
If anyone asks, just
tell them my name!

1555
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:33,008
Who's going to stop the MLA's car?
- That's right!

1556
01:41:33,434 --> 01:41:36,766
We will make this town come to a
standstill! - There... They've stopped us!

1557
01:41:36,767 --> 01:41:40,442
We will protest!
We will fight!

1558
01:41:40,501 --> 01:41:42,037
It's his car. Don't let
him go whatever he says!

1559
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:45,047
We will protest until death!

1560
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:48,445
Our dear Vikraman...

1561
01:41:48,567 --> 01:41:51,411
was stabbed by a rogue"

1562
01:41:51,601 --> 01:41:53,547
The car can't go this way.
- It's the MLA's car.

1563
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,443
MLA or Minister"
Turn the car around!

1564
01:41:55,534 --> 01:41:56,638
You have no respect at all!

1565
01:41:56,701 --> 01:41:59,705
Our dear Vikraman...

1566
01:41:59,767 --> 01:42:02,646
was stabbed by a rogue"

1567
01:42:02,734 --> 01:42:04,680
We won't spare him, for sure!

1568
01:42:05,067 --> 01:42:07,013
Friend, let me talk"

1569
01:42:07,467 --> 01:42:10,676
This murder happened because of the
personal grudge between 2 people.

1570
01:42:10,767 --> 01:42:12,433
Don't trouble the public for that.

1571
01:42:12,434 --> 01:42:14,141
Don't give classes
wearing a coat, sir.

1572
01:42:14,201 --> 01:42:16,738
Your party also holds a lot of strikes,
right? - What if we come with a car then?

1573
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,138
For that, do you have a car?

1574
01:42:20,067 --> 01:42:22,980
I have no time to argue"
I need to reach the airport"

1575
01:42:23,434 --> 01:42:25,971
if it was anywhere else, we would have let
you go. But airport, that we won't allow!

1576
01:42:26,067 --> 01:42:29,480
Why? - OurVikraman Chettan became a
martyr in the name of an aeroplane!

1577
01:42:29,601 --> 01:42:35,017
'Brother killed brother in an argument
about the height of an aeroplane!'

1578
01:42:38,134 --> 01:42:40,637
What happened?
- Anyway, that was a great idea!

1579
01:42:41,134 --> 01:42:43,136
Who idea was it?
- His..

1580
01:42:46,634 --> 01:42:48,511
Tell boss not to
make this a habit.

1581
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,238
Or else, I'll lose my job!

1582
01:42:53,734 --> 01:42:56,399
Go back! I won't even see that you were
my teacher. I'll squeeze your eyes out!

1583
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,277
He wants to go to the
hospital with his mother!

1584
01:43:12,734 --> 01:43:15,510
Are you scared of being
on top of the horse?

1585
01:43:16,134 --> 01:43:18,080
If I was scared, would I
let you into my house?

1586
01:43:27,434 --> 01:43:29,380
The Strike organizers
are embarrassed!

1587
01:43:31,534 --> 01:43:34,344
Me coming with the horse, became
a huge favour for you, right?

1588
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:36,511
Yes. In all ways!

1589
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:44,779
Sir..

1590
01:43:45,268 --> 01:43:49,307
This shop is owned by a very
rich man called Asif Ali.

1591
01:43:49,467 --> 01:43:50,445
YousufAli...!

1592
01:43:50,534 --> 01:43:51,533
Is it?

1593
01:43:51,534 --> 01:43:53,309
Oh!
- Shop, it seems!

1594
01:44:01,267 --> 01:44:02,466
Stop! Stop!

1595
01:44:02,467 --> 01:44:04,099
Should I tell the horse or them?

1596
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:05,204
Stop.
- Who are you?

1597
01:44:05,267 --> 01:44:06,746
Where are you going,
Achilles <i>&</i> Hector'?

1598
01:44:07,167 --> 01:44:08,976
A sword fight happened
in our home-town.

1599
01:44:09,067 --> 01:44:11,377
So it's a strike there..
Regional strike"

1600
01:44:11,467 --> 01:44:13,447
Horses can't be parked in here..

1601
01:44:13,667 --> 01:44:15,544
Buddy, don't waste time.
I'll miss the flight.

1602
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,013
I can't let any vehicle without
a number plate inside.

1603
01:44:19,234 --> 01:44:21,646
Sir, shall we go to Delhi on this?
- No!

1604
01:44:22,301 --> 01:44:23,609
Why are you paying money?

1605
01:44:23,767 --> 01:44:25,474
He should raise it, right?
- No need.

1606
01:44:25,601 --> 01:44:28,605
The horse will jump over it. Wanna
see that? - Don't do all that!

1607
01:44:28,667 --> 01:44:30,305
Chetta, keep this and open it..

1608
01:44:31,334 --> 01:44:34,042
You could've given this earlier.
- You want to break my leg?

1609
01:44:34,234 --> 01:44:35,440
See! It's going UP!

1610
01:44:35,567 --> 01:44:38,104
Isn't it wrong to pay bribes?
- Only receiving bribes is wrong.

1611
01:44:40,067 --> 01:44:42,366
This is my first
time at an airport.

1612
01:44:42,367 --> 01:44:44,506
This is my first time at
an airport on horseback!

1613
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,539
The piles who drive the planes
have a great time, right?

1614
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,045
Not piles.
Pilots!

1615
01:44:52,467 --> 01:44:53,537
That's to stop him.

1616
01:44:54,401 --> 01:44:55,379
Shall I get down?
- Yes.

1617
01:45:04,334 --> 01:45:05,312
Thank you.

1618
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,233
So see you day after tomorrow.

1619
01:45:07,234 --> 01:45:08,212
'If Allah wills it'

1620
01:45:09,701 --> 01:45:11,977
Sacred cord, rosary"
You have everything"

1621
01:45:12,234 --> 01:45:13,212
Actually, who are you?

1622
01:45:13,434 --> 01:45:15,539
Everything is the
same for us, sir!

1623
01:45:24,101 --> 01:45:26,012
Another shuttlecock?
Where did it come from?

1624
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:27,272
Hey! We are love-two, now!

1625
01:45:29,567 --> 01:45:31,569
Love too?
- No. We're losing!

1626
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,737
Is it? Then move!
Let me hit a sixer!

1627
01:45:35,301 --> 01:45:36,974
Then shall I say something?

1628
01:45:37,134 --> 01:45:39,239
Horses have the biggest
eyes on land"

1629
01:45:39,767 --> 01:45:42,145
Well.. I know all that!

1630
01:45:45,134 --> 01:45:46,704
Stand there...
- Give it to me..

1631
01:45:47,234 --> 01:45:49,077
Let me take a selfie
with the camel now..

1632
01:45:49,134 --> 01:45:52,766
Last week, my husband sent
me a selfie with a lion!

1633
01:45:52,767 --> 01:45:54,610
I want to shock him!

1634
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:57,603
The one who took a photo with the lion;
did he call after that?

1635
01:45:57,700 --> 01:45:58,770
He is adventurous!

1636
01:46:00,101 --> 01:46:02,047
Well... He...

1637
01:46:05,667 --> 01:46:08,079
Oh no! Let me try calling him..

1638
01:46:11,334 --> 01:46:12,677
Chechi, get me that shuttlecock..

1639
01:46:23,067 --> 01:46:24,375
Do you want water?
- No.

1640
01:46:29,367 --> 01:46:30,345
Got it?

1641
01:46:32,634 --> 01:46:34,636
You don't trust me well
enough yet, right?

1642
01:46:41,267 --> 01:46:43,474
Thinking that a grasshopper
would bring him luck,

1643
01:46:43,534 --> 01:46:45,499
Boss put a grasshopper
into his pocket.

1644
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:46,478
And then?

1645
01:46:46,534 --> 01:46:48,775
Then that grasshopper ate the
only 100 Rupees note he had.

1646
01:46:49,267 --> 01:46:50,245
Sir..

1647
01:46:50,767 --> 01:46:52,337
Put your leg down!

1648
01:46:53,334 --> 01:46:56,033
Sir, is it a crime
to steal mobiles?

1649
01:46:56,034 --> 01:46:57,012
Of course!

1650
01:46:58,101 --> 01:46:59,079
Have some water.

1651
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:05,266
Payasam? Is there
something special today?

1652
01:47:05,267 --> 01:47:06,337
It's my birthday today.

1653
01:47:06,434 --> 01:47:07,633
That's awesome!

1654
01:47:07,634 --> 01:47:09,170
Shouldn't we celebrate this?

1655
01:47:09,367 --> 01:47:11,005
Let's celebrate when
his birthday comes.

1656
01:47:11,434 --> 01:47:13,766
I just remember my birthday,
and go to the temple once.

1657
01:47:13,767 --> 01:47:14,745
That's all!

1658
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:16,173
It's always like that.

1659
01:47:16,234 --> 01:47:18,180
Mothers would remem ber their
children's birthdays.

1660
01:47:18,267 --> 01:47:20,747
And many children don't remember
their mothers' birthdays...

1661
01:47:23,567 --> 01:47:25,444
You have a long tongue!

1662
01:47:25,801 --> 01:47:28,266
Then tell me..
When is your mothefs birthday?

1663
01:47:28,267 --> 01:47:29,245
Trapped!

1664
01:47:30,334 --> 01:47:32,245
Then shall I say something?

1665
01:47:33,067 --> 01:47:34,705
I don't even know who my mother is!

1666
01:47:35,067 --> 01:47:36,045
That's it!

1667
01:47:44,267 --> 01:47:47,373
Happy Birthday to You!

1668
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:50,977
Happy Birthday to You!

1669
01:47:51,334 --> 01:47:54,781
Happy Birthday dear Am ma!

1670
01:47:55,067 --> 01:47:57,775
Happy Birthday to You!

1671
01:47:58,201 --> 01:48:01,410
Happy Birthday to You!

1672
01:48:01,467 --> 01:48:02,733
H .
aPPV Birthday to You!
- Enough!

1673
01:48:02,734 --> 01:48:04,611
That's the only English
song he knows.

1674
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:08,299
What happened?

1675
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:10,280
Then shall I tell you a truth?

1676
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:14,010
Wherever I go, I
bring luck there..

1677
01:48:14,367 --> 01:48:16,711
This is double the
happiness, right?

1678
01:48:26,734 --> 01:48:27,712
What happened?

1679
01:48:28,734 --> 01:48:30,975
Mom <i>&</i> her have gone to the
hospital, to confirm it.

1680
01:48:31,101 --> 01:48:32,136
Didn't you go?

1681
01:48:32,301 --> 01:48:33,279
No!

1682
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:34,743
This was over once for mom!

1683
01:48:35,034 --> 01:48:38,174
It's not like that for me..
So I'm slightly tensed about that..

1684
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:44,372
What happened?

1685
01:48:44,534 --> 01:48:46,673
Confirmed!
It's definitely chicken pox!

1686
01:48:46,801 --> 01:48:48,542
Now she can't anything
that's sour...

1687
01:48:49,701 --> 01:48:52,266
Didn't I tell you?
Mom had it once, so it's okay for her.

1688
01:48:52,267 --> 01:48:54,474
Great! Now she won't be
clicking so many selfies.

1689
01:48:57,501 --> 01:48:58,633
Then move away...

1690
01:48:58,634 --> 01:49:02,081
If it spreads, you can't even give
hand shakes during the campaign"

1691
01:49:02,434 --> 01:49:05,074
Wow! Chicken pox!
Superb!

1692
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:07,607
In Tamil Nad u, it's called Am ma Vilayattu"

1693
01:49:07,734 --> 01:49:09,771
Once you have this, it brings
loads of good fortune.

1694
01:49:23,167 --> 01:49:24,737
James Thomas, from enforcement.

1695
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,438
We need to search your house.

1696
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:31,478
Warrant!

1697
01:49:33,267 --> 01:49:35,178
Both the good fortune
people, move away...

1698
01:49:36,401 --> 01:49:37,379
Sir, please.

1699
01:49:38,401 --> 01:49:39,379
Pillai..

1700
01:49:43,234 --> 01:49:45,544
There's an important thing"
Disconnect the land phone here.

1701
01:49:45,601 --> 01:49:46,579
What sir?

1702
01:49:46,634 --> 01:49:48,409
Disconnect the land phone here.

1703
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:49,478
Yes sir..

1704
01:49:58,734 --> 01:50:00,600
Sir, one is beside the
table in the bedroom.

1705
01:50:00,601 --> 01:50:02,547
One is behind the
fridge in the kitchen.

1706
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,045
I'll be under the bed.

1707
01:50:04,101 --> 01:50:05,671
Pillai, we're not playing
hide <i>&</i> seek here!

1708
01:50:05,734 --> 01:50:07,475
It's a raid!
Search!

1709
01:50:07,568 --> 01:50:08,672
He's fooling around!

1710
01:50:13,267 --> 01:50:15,178
Even though he's a VIP,
he wears Jockey, huh?

1711
01:50:32,434 --> 01:50:33,572
Search over there"

1712
01:50:42,467 --> 01:50:44,708
Dear" If you're not
well, go and lie down..

1713
01:50:45,501 --> 01:50:46,479
No mom.

1714
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,606
Look over there.

1715
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:58,978
Search it fully!

1716
01:51:00,434 --> 01:51:01,412
Why are you tensed?

1717
01:51:02,168 --> 01:51:04,512
Some stuff that belongs
to me, is inside.

1718
01:51:04,767 --> 01:51:06,542
Will these policemen
take all of them away?

1719
01:51:06,667 --> 01:51:07,645
Will they?

1720
01:51:45,601 --> 01:51:47,239
Biting my ear sitting
on my shoulder?

1721
01:51:47,301 --> 01:51:50,214
Isn't there anyone
here to take it off?

1722
01:51:50,267 --> 01:51:51,974
Oh! You were sitting here?

1723
01:51:52,267 --> 01:51:54,747
He is an innocent chap, sir.
Want to kiss him?

1724
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,576
You grow Anoles at home, sir?
- Sir, a colourful chicken!

1725
01:51:57,634 --> 01:52:00,240
It's a pheasant, sir.
Take it away.

1726
01:52:00,334 --> 01:52:03,213
Sorry sir.. It was a wrong information,
that were was black money here.

1727
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,600
What happened?

1728
01:52:05,601 --> 01:52:06,799
Sir, I checked the whole house.

1729
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,336
There's no land phone
in this house!

1730
01:52:08,701 --> 01:52:11,633
You're too much, man! This is why
you're not getting any promotion!

1731
01:52:11,634 --> 01:52:12,669
Come!

1732
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:14,478
Come!

1733
01:52:29,134 --> 01:52:30,112
What is it?

1734
01:52:30,234 --> 01:52:32,407
What's the matter'? I've been
noticing for a longtime.

1735
01:52:32,467 --> 01:52:33,411
What is it, son?

1736
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:37,413
I said that I'm going to Delhi,
but went to Dubai instead.

1737
01:52:38,334 --> 01:52:39,312
To meet Naseer.

1738
01:52:40,567 --> 01:52:43,411
There was Rs. 10 Lakhs which he
donated to the election fund, over here.

1739
01:52:44,101 --> 01:52:46,240
The bag that had it..
- Where's that money now?

1740
01:52:48,467 --> 01:52:50,276
Hey! Kaleshetta!

1741
01:55:45,667 --> 01:55:47,066
Don't burst crackers!

1742
01:55:47,067 --> 01:55:48,045
Don't go!

1743
01:55:48,134 --> 01:55:50,045
Jimmy is busted!

1744
01:55:50,101 --> 01:55:52,466
Hey! Don't burst
crackers like this.

1745
01:55:52,467 --> 01:55:54,140
Those birds will die
if they get scared.

1746
01:55:56,267 --> 01:55:58,577
Hey! Can you please listen to me?

1747
01:55:59,067 --> 01:56:01,445
Hello!! Someone?
Hey!

1748
01:56:01,501 --> 01:56:03,777
My dear friend, listen to me.
- Get lost, man!

1749
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,479
Those birds will die
if they get scared.

1750
01:56:05,567 --> 01:56:07,478
Let me tell you..
Hey! Don't light it!

1751
01:56:07,567 --> 01:56:08,773
No!

1752
01:56:14,401 --> 01:56:15,379
Thank you Madam.

1753
01:56:16,034 --> 01:56:18,133
We'll be getting only this juice?
- No.

1754
01:56:18,134 --> 01:56:20,171
Leave only after eating
Tiger biscuits as well.

1755
01:56:21,134 --> 01:56:24,240
Even in Jimmy's own ward,
we got a majority!

1756
01:56:25,001 --> 01:56:25,979
One minute"

1757
01:56:26,301 --> 01:56:27,712
Oh! I'm getting a call from Delhi.

1758
01:56:28,067 --> 01:56:30,274
It's there in my horoscope
that I'll drive a State car.

1759
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:31,378
How are you?

1760
01:56:31,467 --> 01:56:32,445
We won!

1761
01:56:33,434 --> 01:56:35,641
There are rumours that you may become
a minister this time. Is it true?

1762
01:56:35,734 --> 01:56:36,712
Say it..

1763
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,441
Many great leaders of the party
were my father's contemporaries.

1764
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:42,100
Let the party tell me..

1765
01:56:42,101 --> 01:56:44,012
And the let the one
up above decide!

1766
01:56:44,234 --> 01:56:47,266
Kalesh is saying that the party and the
High Command above them would decide,

1767
01:56:47,267 --> 01:56:48,600
whether he would be a minister.

1768
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:50,433
A high command meeting
will happen soon.

1769
01:56:50,434 --> 01:56:52,243
Earlier, you were an MLA's wife.

1770
01:56:52,301 --> 01:56:53,405
Now you're an MLA's mother.

1771
01:56:53,567 --> 01:56:56,776
We heard that the political advisor
of both father <i>&</i> son, is the mother.

1772
01:56:57,001 --> 01:56:58,105
Is it true?
Tell us!

1773
01:56:58,434 --> 01:57:00,072
If you ask me if it's true, no!

1774
01:57:00,534 --> 01:57:02,480
But if you ask me if
it's not true, yes.

1775
01:57:02,534 --> 01:57:04,536
His mother is saying
yes and no...

1776
01:57:08,201 --> 01:57:09,500
Now you may ask"

1777
01:57:09,501 --> 01:57:12,175
Madam, can you give a kiss to sir'?

1778
01:57:12,267 --> 01:57:13,337
No need of that!

1779
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:16,210
No.. If both the wife and
mother kiss him on both cheeks,

1780
01:57:16,267 --> 01:57:18,645
we can give a caption as 'Victory Kiss'.
It will be amazing.

1781
01:57:18,701 --> 01:57:20,566
Well... That"
- It will be great"

1782
01:57:20,567 --> 01:57:22,069
Mom, come on..
- Get lost, man!

1783
01:57:22,134 --> 01:57:23,579
Madam, come closer.

1784
01:57:24,767 --> 01:57:26,333
Ask them to stop
bursting crackers.

1785
01:57:26,334 --> 01:57:27,779
Friend, please move away.

1786
01:57:28,067 --> 01:57:29,705
Sir, the birds will die!

1787
01:57:31,501 --> 01:57:32,479
Fine?

1788
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:33,704
Okay. Bye.
Thank you!

1789
01:57:33,767 --> 01:57:40,446
Kalesh is our darling!

1790
01:57:41,634 --> 01:57:43,272
We were also watching TV.

1791
01:57:43,367 --> 01:57:44,710
Of course!
- Hey!

1792
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:46,738
We have a majority in
Kaduthuruthy as well.

1793
01:57:47,267 --> 01:57:50,339
Watch me on live news
tomorrow morning"

1794
01:57:51,234 --> 01:57:52,799
Come here..
Don't worry..

1795
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:53,778
Stop it!

1796
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:57,207
Stop! Where the hell are you barging in?
Can't you see that people are here?

1797
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:59,038
What?
Who are you?

1798
01:57:59,801 --> 01:58:00,799
Tell me!

1799
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,040
Blocking my way?

1800
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:05,304
Who do you think you are?

1801
01:58:05,367 --> 01:58:06,345
Move away!

1802
01:58:09,567 --> 01:58:10,545
<i>Nasser'.!</i>

1803
01:58:13,434 --> 01:58:14,606
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1804
01:58:14,734 --> 01:58:16,333
Amazing, right?
- What was it there?

1805
01:58:16,334 --> 01:58:17,574
I just scared them a bit.

1806
01:58:18,501 --> 01:58:19,479
Come.

1807
01:58:20,734 --> 01:58:22,466
Even though it's Naseer
(hero) who came,

1808
01:58:22,467 --> 01:58:24,208
for him he's MN
Nambiar (Villain).

1809
01:58:28,401 --> 01:58:30,438
Such a huge defeat!

1810
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:32,704
Why aren't you saying anything, sir'?

1811
01:58:33,067 --> 01:58:37,038
Is that question you should be asking
someone who has lost everything?

1812
01:58:37,134 --> 01:58:40,200
Shall we appeal saying that the
voting machine was damaged,

1813
01:58:40,201 --> 01:58:43,546
so that whoever we vote for,
only Kalesh would get the vote.

1814
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:47,571
To appeal, Sir didn't compete for the light
music com petition in the youth festival!

1815
01:58:47,668 --> 01:58:52,174
Abraham Lincoln became the American
President after failing in 11 elections.

1816
01:58:52,567 --> 01:58:55,571
But it wasn't such a disgraceful loss.

1817
01:58:56,267 --> 01:58:59,271
These are firecrackers we
bought for the election.

1818
01:58:59,601 --> 01:59:00,739
To burst them if we won!

1819
01:59:01,434 --> 01:59:02,538
What do we do with it now?

1820
01:59:02,734 --> 01:59:06,307
Shall we sell it to Kalesh's
party at half-price?

1821
01:59:06,401 --> 01:59:08,074
No! Burst it on my chest!

1822
01:59:08,401 --> 01:59:10,608
Burst it!
Burst it!

1823
01:59:10,667 --> 01:59:12,578
Let's close the door
<i>&</i> burst it inside.

1824
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,571
He is almost 10 years old now.

1825
01:59:19,601 --> 01:59:22,081
He belongs to the race of
horses brought by the British.

1826
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:23,472
The price is a problem!

1827
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:26,266
I was just saying"
You give me whatever you can...

1828
01:59:26,267 --> 01:59:28,144
I have a resort at Cherai beach.

1829
01:59:28,534 --> 01:59:30,741
Recently, a naive
boy at the beach"

1830
01:59:31,234 --> 01:59:33,077
During the evenings,
he comes with a horse.

1831
01:59:33,134 --> 01:59:35,410
Then he takes people on top
of the horse, for rounds.

1832
01:59:35,567 --> 01:59:37,547
50 Rupees for one round.

1833
01:59:37,634 --> 01:59:40,774
By dusk, he makes around
1000-1500 Rupees.

1834
01:59:41,134 --> 01:59:42,977
If we have a horse that we own,

1835
01:59:43,101 --> 01:59:44,774
that money will also
come to us, right?

1836
01:59:48,668 --> 01:59:51,274
There are children who sell
peanuts at the beach. - So?

1837
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:53,345
If you learn that
peanut sales as well,

1838
01:59:53,467 --> 01:59:55,276
that money will also
come to you, right?

1839
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:58,199
So what about the horse?

1840
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,339
I'm not selling it..
- Think about it once more.

1841
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,107
I'm not selling it!

1842
02:00:07,267 --> 02:00:08,245
What happened?

1843
02:00:09,634 --> 02:00:10,612
The price wasn't okay?

1844
02:00:10,734 --> 02:00:12,338
This alone is not enough.

1845
02:00:13,234 --> 02:00:15,077
Sol bathed him in vain..
- No..

1846
02:00:15,234 --> 02:00:17,441
He is looking really handsome now.

1847
02:00:17,501 --> 02:00:20,072
Someone will come, who will
take care of him really well.

1848
02:00:20,367 --> 02:00:22,244
Who bathes the horses
in the forests?

1849
02:00:22,434 --> 02:00:24,366
Shall I tell you something then?

1850
02:00:24,367 --> 02:00:26,574
In the forests of our
state, there are no horses.

1851
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:27,735
Is it?
- Yes.

1852
02:00:27,801 --> 02:00:29,144
I didn't know that.

1853
02:00:29,367 --> 02:00:31,142
And ya..
- What?

1854
02:00:31,267 --> 02:00:32,439
No need.. Nothing.

1855
02:00:33,534 --> 02:00:35,013
Tell me whatever it is..

1856
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:38,239
You shouldn't have sold the
house you were staying in,

1857
02:00:38,334 --> 02:00:39,745
to Eappachan for such a low price.

1858
02:00:41,267 --> 02:00:43,304
If that Dubai guy throws
us out, where will we go?

1859
02:00:46,167 --> 02:00:47,737
Kalesh sir is not like earlier now.

1860
02:00:48,134 --> 02:00:50,705
After he won, there's a difference
in his behaviourtowards us.

1861
02:00:51,267 --> 02:00:52,245
Let it be.

1862
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:55,108
I haven't planned to stay
in his house forever.

1863
02:00:55,267 --> 02:00:57,008
We need to leave some
day or the other.

1864
02:00:57,067 --> 02:00:58,444
Still, how can he do that to us?

1865
02:00:58,501 --> 02:01:00,003
Who's this 'us'?

1866
02:01:00,734 --> 02:01:05,240
It's wrong to expect how
another person should behave to us..

1867
02:01:06,201 --> 02:01:07,578
Stop it!

1868
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:09,766
You've been advising
me for so long!

1869
02:01:09,767 --> 02:01:11,144
Who do you think you are?

1870
02:01:11,767 --> 02:01:14,008
When I gave you freedom,
you're over-utilizing it?

1871
02:01:15,067 --> 02:01:17,707
Look for someone else to clean the
dog-shit and elephant dung...

1872
02:01:20,434 --> 02:01:21,412
Sad?

1873
02:01:23,167 --> 02:01:27,616
It's wrong to expect how
another person should behave to us..

1874
02:01:28,101 --> 02:01:29,079
Come.

1875
02:01:37,334 --> 02:01:38,574
Eat how much ever you want.

1876
02:01:39,034 --> 02:01:40,433
Once you go to the Gulf,

1877
02:01:40,434 --> 02:01:44,211
when are you going to get this rice
<i>&</i> Pulisshery, with mother's love?

1878
02:01:45,267 --> 02:01:47,770
People in Kerala think that we
don't get rice in the Gulf.

1879
02:01:48,067 --> 02:01:50,104
Mom, we get much better
rice in the Gulf!

1880
02:01:50,701 --> 02:01:52,578
Compared to that, this
is not tasty enough.

1881
02:01:54,101 --> 02:01:55,580
What about the thing I asked you?

1882
02:01:55,734 --> 02:01:57,111
Didn't I tell you when I called?

1883
02:01:57,567 --> 02:01:58,739
Let them stay here..

1884
02:02:00,267 --> 02:02:01,245
Water?

1885
02:02:03,567 --> 02:02:05,513
This love, we can't
find in the Gulf!

1886
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:08,433
Dude, you should take this seriously.

1887
02:02:08,434 --> 02:02:10,414
He won't do well,
if he stays here.

1888
02:02:10,768 --> 02:02:12,577
Arrange some job for
him in the Gulf.

1889
02:02:12,701 --> 02:02:14,112
Let him live happily over there.

1890
02:02:15,267 --> 02:02:17,144
I couldn't find both
of them anywhere.

1891
02:02:17,401 --> 02:02:20,280
Usually, both of them land up
here when it's time to have food.

1892
02:02:20,401 --> 02:02:21,539
Mom, give me some Thoran..

1893
02:02:24,567 --> 02:02:25,566
Just a little..

1894
02:02:25,567 --> 02:02:27,103
Now you eat all this when
you go back to Gulf.

1895
02:02:27,167 --> 02:02:29,408
The donkeys here would
eat this Thoran dish...

1896
02:02:29,567 --> 02:02:31,547
Well, what's happening with his job?

1897
02:02:31,767 --> 02:02:34,043
No one has to come to the
Middle East for normal jobs.

1898
02:02:34,234 --> 02:02:35,304
That's the situation there.

1899
02:02:36,434 --> 02:02:37,970
But his job has a scope..

1900
02:02:38,767 --> 02:02:41,077
There's an Emirates
Zoo in Abu Dhabi..

1901
02:02:41,634 --> 02:02:43,375
Naseema's brother is
an HR head there.

1902
02:02:43,467 --> 02:02:44,445
I'll ask him.

1903
02:02:44,567 --> 02:02:46,774
As an animal trainer
or zoo-keeper..

1904
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:48,478
Let's see..

1905
02:02:48,534 --> 02:02:49,512
Oh no!

1906
02:02:49,568 --> 02:02:51,605
You're taking him
for a job in a zoo?

1907
02:02:51,667 --> 02:02:52,611
No.

1908
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:55,203
Let's make that wimp the manager
of the National bank then!

1909
02:02:55,767 --> 02:02:59,112
Whatever it is, tell him only after
confirming that he would get a job.

1910
02:02:59,301 --> 02:03:01,542
Why should we give him false hopes?

1911
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:14,579
Is Kalesh sir at home?
- No.

1912
02:03:14,667 --> 02:03:17,045
He has gone for some party meeting.

1913
02:03:17,534 --> 02:03:19,741
Along with this, take 6-7
Cotton Ponnadas as well..

1914
02:03:20,034 --> 02:03:21,012
What's it for?

1915
02:03:21,501 --> 02:03:24,133
Next week, there's a function
where the MLA honours,

1916
02:03:24,134 --> 02:03:26,410
everyone in the constituency who
has crossed 85 years.

1917
02:03:26,534 --> 02:03:28,707
World Old Age Day"
- End of Word day?

1918
02:03:29,101 --> 02:03:30,079
Is the date fixed?

1919
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:32,712
World Old Age Day"
- Phew!

1920
02:03:35,501 --> 02:03:38,345
How is this?
- This will be superb for you, sir.

1921
02:03:40,267 --> 02:03:43,305
And this one? - This is the one
that will be superb for you, sir.

1922
02:03:44,234 --> 02:03:45,212
Supefl

1923
02:03:47,634 --> 02:03:48,612
Don't want?

1924
02:04:10,501 --> 02:04:11,479
Hey!

1925
02:04:12,067 --> 02:04:13,045
Come.

1926
02:04:13,134 --> 02:04:14,579
Why?
- Come here.

1927
02:04:15,034 --> 02:04:16,012
Come.

1928
02:04:21,334 --> 02:04:23,245
Which one is best among these two?
- Super!

1929
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:24,578
Get lost!

1930
02:04:25,168 --> 02:04:26,146
You tell me.

1931
02:04:27,134 --> 02:04:28,112
How much does it cost?

1932
02:04:28,667 --> 02:04:30,237
I'm paying for it, right?

1933
02:04:30,601 --> 02:04:31,579
Which one is best?

1934
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:34,273
This is worn on top, right?

1935
02:04:35,401 --> 02:04:36,709
If so...

1936
02:04:37,467 --> 02:04:38,775
wear this"

1937
02:04:39,134 --> 02:04:41,580
and if you wear the other one
on top of it, it will be great.

1938
02:04:43,634 --> 02:04:44,772
Get lost!

1939
02:04:45,134 --> 02:04:48,138
You're standing here?
Come with me.

1940
02:04:48,634 --> 02:04:50,614
Wear it <i>&</i> wear the other
one on top of it!

1941
02:04:53,367 --> 02:04:56,075
Tell me which one you liked
the most among all these?

1942
02:04:59,601 --> 02:05:01,706
I'm not good at giving opinions!

1943
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:04,404
Then shall we select it?

1944
02:05:04,801 --> 02:05:06,644
Finally don't say that
you didn't like it.

1945
02:05:07,167 --> 02:05:08,271
It's for you!

1946
02:05:12,234 --> 02:05:14,699
Where will I go,
wearing all these?

1947
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:15,678
All that's there!

1948
02:05:26,634 --> 02:05:28,978
Give them a 20% discount,

1949
02:05:29,101 --> 02:05:33,266
and our special gift!

1950
02:05:33,267 --> 02:05:35,474
It's still the same old glass
tumbler, right? No need!

1951
02:05:35,534 --> 02:05:37,639
He will say all that.
You give it to me, dear"

1952
02:05:40,101 --> 02:05:41,375
I'll sell it to the scrap seller.

1953
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:45,310
Venu, close the door fast,
or else, the AC will leak.

1954
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:46,970
He doesn't listen to me.

1955
02:05:47,267 --> 02:05:49,577
I'm coming there to
meet Kalesh sir.

1956
02:05:49,634 --> 02:05:51,409
About laying the
foundation for the shop..

1957
02:05:52,134 --> 02:05:54,740
So this shop doesn't have a foundation yet?
- Not this shop!

1958
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:57,246
It's for the new showroom.
It's highly profitable.

1959
02:05:58,200 --> 02:06:00,476
Just pay 50,000 Rupees thrice.
- Hey!

1960
02:06:00,634 --> 02:06:02,045
Is that enough?

1961
02:06:03,268 --> 02:06:04,338
Hey!
- See you next week!

1962
02:06:04,434 --> 02:06:06,100
Since you haven't
updated your KYC,

1963
02:06:06,101 --> 02:06:08,172
there's a delay in transferring
to your NRI account.

1964
02:06:08,234 --> 02:06:10,441
Indian Economy has hit rock bottom.
Don't you know?

1965
02:06:20,201 --> 02:06:21,202
What is it, son?

1966
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:23,767
He made me pay 2 Lakhs as investment
benefit and all that jazz,

1967
02:06:23,768 --> 02:06:25,233
when I came on leave last time.

1968
02:06:25,234 --> 02:06:28,700
Now there's only 1500 left, after the
Tsunami in Japan <i>&</i> global warming, etc..

1969
02:06:28,701 --> 02:06:32,205
Why are you throwing away
your money randomly, Naseer?

1970
02:06:33,168 --> 02:06:35,671
If you trust me..
Only if you trust me..

1971
02:06:36,034 --> 02:06:37,672
You can be the partner of my next shop.

1972
02:06:37,767 --> 02:06:39,303
I don't trust you.
That's why!

1973
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:43,080
I'm not in for any
deals with Malayalis.

1974
02:06:43,134 --> 02:06:44,442
Then you stay in the Gulf <i>&</i> suffer!

1975
02:06:45,467 --> 02:06:48,141
(Chanting prayers)

1976
02:06:53,101 --> 02:06:55,012
Bless me to get many more trips!

1977
02:06:55,201 --> 02:06:56,179
What is this?

1978
02:06:57,267 --> 02:06:58,644
It's like a temple!

1979
02:06:58,768 --> 02:07:00,304
This is my first trip, sir.

1980
02:07:00,767 --> 02:07:02,110
You should bless me.

1981
02:07:02,434 --> 02:07:03,742
It's been a few
days since I came.

1982
02:07:05,267 --> 02:07:06,245
I will go!

1983
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,343
They start as soon as I land"

1984
02:07:08,434 --> 02:07:09,412
When are you leaving?

1985
02:07:12,134 --> 02:07:13,700
It's my first trip.
Please pray"

1986
02:07:13,701 --> 02:07:15,647
I'll pray even if you
don't get trips.

1987
02:07:15,734 --> 02:07:17,111
Bring the next suitcase!

1988
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:19,978
It's so heavy!

1989
02:07:25,567 --> 02:07:27,069
HorizontaL.

1990
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:28,774
No.. Make it vertical!

1991
02:07:31,134 --> 02:07:32,112
Okay.

1992
02:07:33,567 --> 02:07:36,309
Usually the suitcases are heavy
when people come here from Dubai..

1993
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:37,674
But this is the reverse!

1994
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:39,578
It had tyres?

1995
02:07:41,434 --> 02:07:43,710
Don't forget about his
job once you get there.

1996
02:07:43,801 --> 02:07:44,779
We'll sort it out.

1997
02:07:45,101 --> 02:07:47,479
Make arrangements to
get him a passport.

1998
02:07:48,501 --> 02:07:51,266
Hey! If you keep talking,
you'll miss the flight!

1999
02:07:51,267 --> 02:07:52,541
Yes. Coming!

2000
02:07:53,234 --> 02:07:54,713
We were talking about you..

2001
02:07:55,234 --> 02:07:57,111
The time to get rid of
all these animals.

2002
02:07:57,234 --> 02:07:58,542
After that, you should get going!

2003
02:08:03,367 --> 02:08:04,345
Hey!

2004
02:08:04,434 --> 02:08:06,573
Will I be arrested for
sandalwood smuggling?

2005
02:08:06,634 --> 02:08:08,079
It's my first trip, sir.

2006
02:08:09,367 --> 02:08:10,345
Shall I go?
- Okay.

2007
02:08:10,401 --> 02:08:11,379
Okay then.

2008
02:08:15,568 --> 02:08:17,741
Oh Goddess! There shouldn't
be any obstacles on the way!

2009
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:18,778
Don't go!

2010
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,775
It's your first trip, right?
I've kept 2 lemons for good luck!

2011
02:08:21,001 --> 02:08:22,446
You'll be blessed.
- Start now.

2012
02:08:29,467 --> 02:08:31,708
We're going to the
airport, not Sabarimala"

2013
02:08:32,067 --> 02:08:33,341
It's my first trip, sir..

2014
02:08:52,601 --> 02:08:54,012
Pom elo fruit?

2015
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:59,070
I couldn't find small lemons..

2016
02:09:02,234 --> 02:09:03,736
Oh my God!

2017
02:09:05,634 --> 02:09:07,580
His bloody damned trip!

2018
02:09:13,767 --> 02:09:15,246
Poovaparambil Madhavi,

2019
02:09:17,234 --> 02:09:18,611
Chirayath Lonappan,

2020
02:09:20,234 --> 02:09:22,578
<i>Modappadam Uhhannan Yakob...</i>

2021
02:09:24,434 --> 02:09:26,038
Bhavaniyam ma Vadakkeveedu...

2022
02:09:26,767 --> 02:09:28,405
Eliamma Varghese...

2023
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:33,777
To receive the final honour, I invite
Manthramadathil Ranjith NamboothirL.

2024
02:09:37,034 --> 02:09:38,012
Now,

2025
02:09:38,134 --> 02:09:41,233
to wish us all and
speak a few words...

2026
02:09:41,234 --> 02:09:45,740
I invite the ex-headmistress of
this school, Sreelatha Teacher.

2027
02:09:49,734 --> 02:09:50,712
Namaste.

2028
02:09:51,401 --> 02:09:55,213
I was a teacher in this
school for 33 years.

2029
02:09:55,601 --> 02:09:59,242
One day government called and told
me, you should leave from here.

2030
02:10:00,167 --> 02:10:02,511
It's age for you to retire!

2031
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:04,670
Don't laugh!

2032
02:10:05,634 --> 02:10:07,409
You will also have to leave!

2033
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:10,610
Once you complete your eduction,
you must leave from here.

2034
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:11,778
But still...

2035
02:10:12,001 --> 02:10:14,504
it doesn't matter how
long you were here...

2036
02:10:14,568 --> 02:10:17,549
what matters is what you
did, while you were here!

2037
02:10:19,201 --> 02:10:23,581
We are honouring all the grandfathers
and grandmothers present here,

2038
02:10:23,734 --> 02:10:28,734
not just because they are old;

2039
02:10:28,767 --> 02:10:33,580
We are honouring them because of the ideal
qualities they have shown in life..

2040
02:10:34,567 --> 02:10:36,103
Did you see the faces
of the children?

2041
02:10:38,401 --> 02:10:40,108
- From top to bottom...

2042
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:41,574
I'm getting really bored!

2043
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:46,975
It goes up as hot vapour...

2044
02:10:47,134 --> 02:10:49,740
Then it becomes rain again..
Like that...

2045
02:10:50,734 --> 02:10:51,712
Hello! What is it?

2046
02:10:52,534 --> 02:10:54,309
Dude, I am at a function.

2047
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:55,378
Can you hear me?

2048
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:57,739
About his job..
- Yes?

2049
02:10:58,101 --> 02:10:59,580
He will get a job here.

2050
02:11:00,700 --> 02:11:02,373
Okay dude..
I'll call you..

2051
02:11:04,101 --> 02:11:08,072
Every great thing that we do,
might not be good things..

2052
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:13,110
But, every good thing we do,
will definitely be great things!

2053
02:11:16,468 --> 02:11:18,072
Go slowly, dude!

2054
02:11:28,134 --> 02:11:29,204
Are you busy?

2055
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:30,378
No!

2056
02:11:30,634 --> 02:11:32,307
You're being called inside..

2057
02:11:32,534 --> 02:11:34,172
What's special for lunch?

2058
02:11:34,267 --> 02:11:35,766
Kaleshettan will tell you that.

2059
02:11:35,767 --> 02:11:37,576
He wants to talk about
something serious.

2060
02:11:46,267 --> 02:11:48,008
Must be fish curry..
- They are coming.

2061
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:51,540
Where are you going?
- To have lunch!

2062
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:52,578
Stand there!

2063
02:11:55,334 --> 02:11:56,312
Naseer had called me.

2064
02:11:58,101 --> 02:11:59,079
What's your decision?

2065
02:12:00,601 --> 02:12:02,046
I'll leave"
- When?

2066
02:12:03,634 --> 02:12:05,170
Some more days...

2067
02:12:05,234 --> 02:12:06,679
But it has been so
many days now..

2068
02:12:09,234 --> 02:12:11,339
I've found a place where I
can shift permanently.

2069
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:12,578
I'll leave soon..

2070
02:12:15,768 --> 02:12:16,746
Come in..

2071
02:12:26,301 --> 02:12:28,975
Are you planning to stay
here like this lifelong?

2072
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:32,246
Why did you sell the land
you had in your name?

2073
02:12:32,567 --> 02:12:33,545
Didn't you ask?

2074
02:12:33,668 --> 02:12:36,649
Even if I ask, I don't have the
money to buy so much land.

2075
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:40,102
When we're staying
here as a family,

2076
02:12:40,167 --> 02:12:42,333
have you thought about the
problems we would face,

2077
02:12:42,334 --> 02:12:44,473
when you come here
with so many animals?

2078
02:12:46,034 --> 02:12:47,035
I know!

2079
02:12:47,601 --> 02:12:48,579
Then...

2080
02:12:49,401 --> 02:12:51,074
it's not a problem for us!

2081
02:12:55,701 --> 02:12:58,580
I haven't such a reaction
on both your faces so far.

2082
02:12:58,701 --> 02:13:00,408
Look at your faces!

2083
02:13:01,301 --> 02:13:02,405
I didn't get scared.

2084
02:13:02,467 --> 02:13:04,777
I knew it earlier itself, that
they will let us stay here..

2085
02:13:05,701 --> 02:13:08,739
All of us really like the fact that
you both are staying here..

2086
02:13:10,301 --> 02:13:13,043
We'd wish that people we like,
should do well in life, right?

2087
02:13:13,467 --> 02:13:15,743
Now don't keep it as a surprise..
Tell him the matter!

2088
02:13:16,434 --> 02:13:19,745
Through Naseer, you're going
to get a job in the Gulf!

2089
02:13:20,001 --> 02:13:22,242
If everything's okay, you
might have to go there soon.

2090
02:13:24,367 --> 02:13:25,539
You could have asked me.

2091
02:13:26,568 --> 02:13:28,980
It's a job you know and like!

2092
02:13:29,634 --> 02:13:30,669
At the Emirates Zoo..

2093
02:13:32,101 --> 02:13:33,633
That's great, right?

2094
02:13:33,634 --> 02:13:35,238
Are you the one
who decides that?

2095
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:38,376
What if I'm not in a situation
to go on such a journey?

2096
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,571
Before you decide something about
me, shouldn't you ask me as well?

2097
02:13:42,634 --> 02:13:45,205
We got you this job by calling many
people <i>&</i> going through a lot of trouble.

2098
02:13:45,267 --> 02:13:47,770
Thinking that if you can do
well somewhere, let it happen.

2099
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,537
By doing well, you mean
making money, right?

2100
02:13:50,667 --> 02:13:52,647
I don't need so much
money to live now.

2101
02:13:52,767 --> 02:13:54,610
You're sick in your head!

2102
02:13:55,034 --> 02:13:56,513
Yes.. lam sick!

2103
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:57,578
Stop it!

2104
02:13:57,800 --> 02:14:00,508
We should've asked you first.
I only told him not to.

2105
02:14:00,634 --> 02:14:01,635
Leave now..

2106
02:14:01,767 --> 02:14:04,213
Mom, to leave..
- Get going now!

2107
02:14:09,567 --> 02:14:11,274
If he doesn't like
it, don't force him.

2108
02:14:11,634 --> 02:14:14,444
He's arrogant that he's an orphan.
Don't bother.

2109
02:14:15,067 --> 02:14:16,444
Call me when lunch is ready.

2110
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:29,478
Where did you go?

2111
02:14:33,734 --> 02:14:35,441
Don't skip your sleep
thinking about it.

2112
02:14:36,067 --> 02:14:39,207
He must have some reason
for not leaving from here.

2113
02:14:40,767 --> 02:14:43,748
He had a reason for
coming here as well..

2114
02:15:11,734 --> 02:15:12,678
Chetta!

2115
02:15:12,734 --> 02:15:13,712
Chetta!

2116
02:15:14,167 --> 02:15:15,145
Chetta!

2117
02:15:15,467 --> 02:15:16,445
Chetta!

2118
02:15:17,267 --> 02:15:18,245
Chetta!

2119
02:15:24,334 --> 02:15:25,312
Chetta!

2120
02:15:25,667 --> 02:15:26,645
Chetta!

2121
02:15:27,768 --> 02:15:29,076
Chetta!

2122
02:15:29,667 --> 02:15:31,408
Chetta!

2123
02:15:32,434 --> 02:15:33,936
Sir...

2124
02:18:05,401 --> 02:18:08,280
When you ask next time,
your Daddy will allow you.

2125
02:19:59,567 --> 02:20:00,545
Got it?

2126
02:20:03,067 --> 02:20:04,774
You don't trust me well
enough yet, right?

2127
02:20:06,567 --> 02:20:08,513
That girl who was
standing there...

2128
02:20:40,234 --> 02:20:42,646
I don't have many
great desires, sir..

2129
02:20:43,267 --> 02:20:44,610
I'm like these animals.

2130
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:47,603
Once my stomach is full,
all my problems are solved.

2131
02:20:49,133 --> 02:20:52,239
People here start creating problems,
when their stomach is full!

2132
02:20:52,667 --> 02:20:54,169
Like you said"

2133
02:20:54,601 --> 02:20:56,638
the reason for sorrow
are not desires..

2134
02:20:57,501 --> 02:20:59,071
If there were no desires,

2135
02:20:59,267 --> 02:21:00,575
would Naseer build this house?

2136
02:21:01,067 --> 02:21:02,307
Would you become an MLA?

2137
02:21:03,501 --> 02:21:05,674
The reason for sorrow
is not all that.

2138
02:21:07,067 --> 02:21:08,045
Then?

2139
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:10,575
It's desires that
are not fulfilled.

2140
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:17,104
The pain of the unfulfilled
desires of so many hearts"

2141
02:21:18,067 --> 02:21:19,375
is there on this earth.

2142
02:21:20,634 --> 02:21:24,138
It's because we desire that people
we love should live happily...

2143
02:21:25,234 --> 02:21:26,736
Without even asking me,

2144
02:21:27,300 --> 02:21:29,610
you made a decision about me?

2145
02:21:30,801 --> 02:21:32,405
Such a decision,

2146
02:21:33,634 --> 02:21:34,772
shall I also take it?

2147
02:21:36,767 --> 02:21:39,145
To see the happiness
of someone I like,

2148
02:21:40,567 --> 02:21:42,205
would you help me, sir?

2149
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:48,373
We cannot fulfil every
desire of everyone, right?

2150
02:23:01,100 --> 02:23:03,376
You desired that you wanted
this parrot, right dear'?

2151
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:09,241
Now all this belongs
to you, dear!

2152
02:23:16,267 --> 02:23:17,439
Take it, dear"

2153
02:23:50,433 --> 02:23:54,404
We cannot fulfil every
desire of everyone, right?

2154
02:23:55,667 --> 02:23:58,580
But if you're able to fulfil
certain desires of certain people,

2155
02:23:59,767 --> 02:24:01,246
can't you do it?

2156
02:24:12,567 --> 02:24:16,140
What I placed on her hand, was
not just a five-coloured parrot.

2157
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:20,013
It's the colourful
dreams of five people.

2158
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:25,239
It's the last wish of
my son who's no more...

2159
02:24:26,100 --> 02:24:27,773
To buy a parrot for her..

2160
02:24:30,501 --> 02:24:34,108
To see the happiness of someone I like,
would you help me, sir?

2161
02:24:36,234 --> 02:24:40,273
A child will come into our lives,
as both of us desired...

2162
02:24:43,467 --> 02:24:46,380
Will you bring a parrot
like that for me?
