1
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:10,003
Master, Prepare tea
with fresh tea leaves.

2
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:16,756
'It is for a special person
who is an expert in fighting.'

3
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:21,715
'He can handle any weapon.'

4
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:24,011
'Watch him if you have any doubt.'

5
00:01:43,384 --> 00:01:44,710
He is our hero Marketraja.

6
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,078
His actions are unpredictable.

7
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:51,707
'He is notorious as a fighter.'

8
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:55,135
'Displays his talent
in any settings.'

9
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:10,785
More information about him...

10
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:19,273
"He can kill anyone
with one stroke..."

11
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:24,200
He is Das. Market's sidekick.

12
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,778
He is Varada,
Market's lawyer He taunts everyone.

13
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:29,582
He is Radha. Market's Godfather.
Belongs to ruling party.

14
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:32,264
He is minister Ramdas.
And they are his henchmen.

15
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:36,666
Minister and Godfather
do not get along well.

16
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:40,538
"Still they act as
if they are friends."

17
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,257
"Still they act as
if they are friends."

18
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,511
"The list of his actions is long."

19
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:48,656
"Marketraja is fearless."

20
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:07,014
"Everybody fear when
he takes out a gun."

21
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,087
Who is that?

22
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:24,144
That is for Marketraja.

23
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:27,926
Oh! He has drunk it.
Master, prepare one more cup of tea.

24
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:46,366
Whatever I said till
now is not the story.

25
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:48,045
The real story starts now.

26
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:19,368
Lawyer Varada!

27
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:20,739
We have appointed you

28
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:22,371
because Marketraja
should not appear in court.

29
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:23,699
Why are you giving excuses now?

30
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:25,316
Opposite party has paid huge fees

31
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:26,914
and appointed a senior counsel
from Kolkata.

32
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:28,880
What can I do?
- Yes.

33
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,633
That minister has loads of money.

34
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,464
Tea is not good.

35
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:37,624
Sir, I would also like
to be with Marketraja.

36
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:40,592
Do you want to be in his gang?
- Yes.

37
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:41,788
Get lost.

38
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,202
Greetings, sir.

39
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:55,361
Did you indulge in
fight early in the morning?

40
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:57,964
Yes. I am fine.

41
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:00,874
But he is dead.

42
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:03,568
Oh! I will handle the police matter.

43
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:04,964
Where should we send the body?

44
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:07,283
Send it to Minister Ramdas's
brother-in-law's house.

45
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:08,809
He sent this fellow.

46
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:20,992
Burning candle for that dead man,
as always?

47
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:24,069
Whenever you kill a person,
you light a candle for him.

48
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:26,354
You murder and then light
a candle for the dead. Well done.

49
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:28,320
There are so many candles here.

50
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:32,663
This is for Rickako, this one for
Ringako, this one for Padi Suresh.

51
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:33,964
That one is for Kavisiva.

52
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:35,529
Who is this lean and tall person?

53
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:37,084
Yes. It is for Ayanavaram Mynavathi.

54
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:47,997
Are you still
sharpening the machete?

55
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,847
Hey! Are you telling your wife
at night that I scold you?

56
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:56,164
Why? What happened?
- Then...

57
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:57,805
I told her to stamp
my back to relieve the pain.

58
00:05:57,885 --> 00:05:59,184
But her stamping is giving me pain.

59
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:01,646
Idiot! Sister supports
our livelihood.

60
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:04,249
Can't you message her properly?
- Shut up. Don't shout at me.

61
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,730
Never mind.

62
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,719
Gopal, who involved me in the
moneylender case, called me today.

63
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:16,593
It is 42nd case for me.

64
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:21,907
Better sign now.
Otherwise you will die.

65
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:23,268
Note it.

66
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,975
Sister...
- Do not lick the note.

67
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:27,027
Hey!
- Yes, sister...

68
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:30,149
Who spread rumor that ten
rupee coin is not legal tender?

69
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:33,205
Now we are getting
all the ten rupee coins.

70
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:34,742
Hey! You took money from me.
Tell her.

71
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:35,982
Wait.

72
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,530
He was enquiring
about you in the area.

73
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,953
He needs your help.

74
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,115
He is a contractor.

75
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:43,599
Come...

76
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:47,970
What is your name?
- Nilakandan.

77
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,691
What favor do you need from me?

78
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:55,201
Your son Marketraja has been
awarded railway parking contract.

79
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,976
Has Raja got it?
- Yes.

80
00:06:57,056 --> 00:07:00,807
Of course. Who else will get?

81
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,141
He is my son.

82
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,727
I will be happy if
I get the sub-contract.

83
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:09,505
Please help him. Kanagasabai
is supporting Marketraja.

84
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:12,416
Oh! Is he supporting him?

85
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:15,093
Then I can't interfere.
- She is right.

86
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:18,657
Kanagasabai and you
(Sundaribai) are not equal.

87
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:23,769
Vasoolraja helped me in a
failed love affair when I was young.

88
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:27,766
Now you should help me.
Marketraja is your son.

89
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:30,672
He may be a leader
but he is your son.

90
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:33,855
You are flattering me. Come here.

91
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:36,867
Will you give me a diamond nose ring

92
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:42,320
that shines like the
one in Kalikambal temple?

93
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,221
Of course, I will.

94
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,407
It will shine so bright

95
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:48,340
that if you wear it and go to harbor

96
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,271
the oncoming ships will be confused

97
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:50,923
between the light from nose ring
and the lighthouse. - Move!

98
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,461
Hey old lady, Prepare crab dish.

99
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,620
My husband was working in Court.

100
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,900
I have been witness
to many cases in Court.

101
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,406
How dare you play
tricks with me? You...

102
00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:03,105
How many people are there?
- 12.

103
00:08:03,185 --> 00:08:04,363
Twelve?

104
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,930
Take Rs 1000 for
each person from him.

105
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,045
Take.
- Sundaribai is very happy

106
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,150
that she is going to see her son.

107
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,349
I have made crab curry for Raja.

108
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:17,173
The crab was moving till I fried it.

109
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:18,745
It is very tasty.

110
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:40,850
Why are you putting
your foot on fire?

111
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,183
Did you pray to Goddess
that you will do it?

112
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:43,478
Do not taunt me.

113
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:45,451
You are Marketraja's mother.
It is a mark of respect to you.

114
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:47,693
Yes. Do not flatter me.

115
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:51,056
How is the 'Ice box' business, which
was started in my name, going on?

116
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:52,321
It is going on very well.

117
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,171
Sometimes we supply freezer
boxes to the persons we kill.

118
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:56,632
We kill and also make money from it.

119
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:58,002
That's good.

120
00:08:58,398 --> 00:08:59,579
Who is he?

121
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:00,748
Why is he not showing me respect?

122
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:01,701
He works in tea shop.

123
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:04,824
He wants to join our
gang and is behind me.

124
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,217
Hey! Show your respects to her.

125
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,366
How?

126
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,512
Join all the ten
fingers and bow to her.

127
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,225
That is how she should be respected.
- Hold this.

128
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:12,883
She is Marketraja's mother.
- Mother!

129
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:14,666
Please recommend
me to your son's gang.

130
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:19,108
I am mother only to Marketraj.
For others, I am sister.

131
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:20,760
I am still young.
- Right!

132
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,713
Isn't it?
- Yes.

133
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:24,838
Take.
- Will you please tell him?

134
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:26,801
I will tell him at the right time.
What is your name?

135
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:28,705
Dhanush.
- Dhanush!

136
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:31,069
You will become son-in-law
to an elite family!

137
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,296
Das, order one tea.
- Hold it.

138
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:37,871
Anjalai, I heard the news.
You love a lawyer. Good.

139
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,963
Not me.
- I feel shy.

140
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:41,693
You do not deserve.

141
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:43,381
Neelakanda!
- Sister...

142
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:46,852
I have prepared crab fry.
Tell Raja to eat it.

143
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:48,713
Raja knows how his mother cooks.

144
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:51,042
Sister, greetings.
- Hey! Take it.

145
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:53,270
Get lost.

146
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:56,259
Is everyone a winner here!

147
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,987
Does the loser pay his
money or refuses to pay?

148
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,864
Tell me if there is any problem.

149
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:05,064
I am the only mother of Marketraja.

150
00:10:05,144 --> 00:10:06,983
Where is Raja? Raja?

151
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:08,889
He is upstairs.
Kanagasabai has come.

152
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:11,532
Oh!
- Sister, he is the opposite party.

153
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,805
My opponent?

154
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:14,117
Come on. Let us go and see.
- Okay, sister.

155
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:16,979
Raja!

156
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,154
Raja! Is he upstairs?

157
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:20,701
Right.

158
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:21,808
Hey!
- Greetings, sister.

159
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,032
A big nose ring will
suit my face. Right?

160
00:10:24,112 --> 00:10:25,307
You will look grand.
- Yes.

161
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,484
Are you sub-contractor?
- Yes. Why?

162
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:32,190
You will not be
sub-contractor from now.

163
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:35,180
Dear Raja, are you here?

164
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,160
What is the matter?

165
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:48,607
Hey! In which bar are you drinking?

166
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,337
Will come in ten minutes.
- I slipped.

167
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,589
Buy for me.

168
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:57,963
I came to show my respect to you.

169
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:01,895
But why are you beating your mother?

170
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:04,081
My mother! And you?

171
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:06,292
Did you come to show
your respect to me?

172
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:07,426
Hey Pattala Sundaribai!

173
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:09,242
I have told you many
times not to interfere

174
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:11,721
in my dealing because
you are my mother.

175
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:17,427
Oh! It is paining.

176
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:19,718
Is this the way
to treat your mother?

177
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:21,458
You did not suffer from delivery
pain while giving birth to me.

178
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:23,568
You took pain killers and
delivered me without any pain.

179
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:28,149
I breast fed you.
Why are you beating me?

180
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,989
Did you breastfed me?

181
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,898
You made your maid servants
to give me their milk.

182
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:36,313
Look, I am not requesting
as your mother.

183
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:37,707
I request as Pattala Sundaribai.

184
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:39,867
Give him the sub-contract.

185
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:43,282
I have given word
to a person known to me.

186
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:46,768
Do not come here again
and create a scene.

187
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:49,287
I will throttle your neck. Get lost.

188
00:11:50,228 --> 00:11:52,541
Your hand will pain
because you hit me.

189
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:53,529
Massage it.

190
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:56,207
Are you wondering that I am
doing freezer business in your name?

191
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,264
One day I will send the
box to you and take money for it.

192
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:02,530
Why are you going
without respecting me?

193
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:04,795
Okay. Go.

194
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:10,672
Sister.
- Don't bother me.

195
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:12,740
Marketraja has taken a decision.

196
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,428
He will not change it even
for the sake of his mother.

197
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:18,238
He is my son.

198
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:22,330
Market, this crab gravy
has been prepared by your mother.

199
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,297
Sundaribai travelled by boat
and caught these crabs from sea.

200
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,320
Sundaribai is a liar.

201
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:30,078
She would not have cooked.

202
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,711
She is a 'serial queen'.

203
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,213
Boss, greetings.

204
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:44,483
I have sold the land in OMR,
which you got for me in 2010

205
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,266
for a good amount.

206
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:50,051
So I have sent money in icebox.
- You are God to me.

207
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:52,433
Enjoy. Enjoy.

208
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,034
Steffani!

209
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:20,132
Steffi!

210
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:23,583
Go inside. Everyone can see
your thighs. Go inside.

211
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,550
I am sorry.

212
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,693
Are you hearing song?
- Yes.

213
00:13:29,972 --> 00:13:30,982
Which song?

214
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:33,241
BTS- Korean song.

215
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:34,578
Do you want to listen?
- No.

216
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:36,380
I thought BTS means the public bus!

217
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,868
Our Madam?

218
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:40,710
My Madam. Why did you come here?

219
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,322
Do not tell Boss.

220
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:47,603
It seems your brother-in-law
Marketraja killed him in public.

221
00:13:47,683 --> 00:13:49,166
Look at me and speak.

222
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,900
The person I sent
was killed by Marketraja.

223
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,866
I have just now returned
from the funeral.

224
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,051
Market escapes every time.

225
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,831
Our comrade Radha supports Raja.

226
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:05,662
Who is Marketraja?

227
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:07,033
Move. I will tell her.

228
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,645
He is not a good man.
He is a wicked person.

229
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:12,337
He is not a hero. He is anti hero.

230
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:15,317
Stop it. He is a barbarian.

231
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:18,156
I like barbarians.

232
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,908
Why is she after a barbarian
when she has a better choice?

233
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:21,921
Tell her.

234
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:23,381
What do you mean?

235
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:24,963
I mean you are a better person.

236
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:28,135
She made a movie in
which she was the heroine.

237
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,220
I was the financier.

238
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,418
Since then she is with me.

239
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:33,178
I think I have seen her.

240
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:34,222
You would not have seen.

241
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,780
Even the teaser was not released.
That movie was shelved.

242
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:42,760
This is FM 90.5,
for our Medical College.

243
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,917
Anyone can speak anything.

244
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:50,290
Now our senior Chandrababu is going
to play a love song on mouthorgan.

245
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:51,848
Chandrababu

246
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:55,656
who did you have in mind

247
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:57,397
while composing the song
which you are going to play now?

248
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:01,115
Jazz. Please do not ask that.

249
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:06,220
Because your heart beat
is the rhythm to this tune.

250
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,695
I know it. Do not be scared.

251
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,042
I have switched off the mike.

252
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:11,875
Nobody can hear. Tell now.

253
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:13,291
Please leave me.

254
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:18,007
You have to tell who she is.

255
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:18,915
Okay.

256
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:22,347
Promise that you
will not tell anyone.

257
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:24,969
I will not disclose
the person's name.

258
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,001
Vanishri.

259
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,410
Our dean's daughter? That beauty?

260
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,785
Very good.

261
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:40,351
No one should know this.
- Stop it.

262
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:42,827
Nobody will know. Play now.

263
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:07,209
If you hesitate to me

264
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,883
how are you going to propose to her?

265
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:12,375
I cannot do it.

266
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:14,566
But one thing.

267
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:18,940
If Vanishri's lips
replace this mouthorgan...

268
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:22,009
If she kisses me lovingly...

269
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,698
My wish will be fulfilled.

270
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,899
My soul will then rest in peace.

271
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:33,932
Get up. Get up.

272
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:35,767
My plan worked out.

273
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:39,150
This is our college FM 90.5.
- Go.

274
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,565
Go.

275
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:44,113
If you really love me

276
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:46,250
you have to watch the
demo where embalming is done.

277
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,971
Without fear and with eyes open.

278
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:50,849
There are liquid in body.
Will show you practically.

279
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:51,936
Did you see the body?

280
00:16:52,016 --> 00:16:55,191
Do you know which sense
organ loses its sense last?

281
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:56,813
Ear.
- Correct.

282
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:59,182
After death, wax leaks in the body.

283
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:00,875
It will try to protect
the corpse from getting decayed.

284
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:01,757
That is nature.

285
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:03,269
But it will not last long.

286
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:04,874
That is why we do embalming.

287
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:09,748
We should insert this tube here
and inject the embalming liquid.

288
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:15,685
Doctor, I am able to hear well now.

289
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:17,908
Hey! Chandrababu!
- Hey!

290
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:19,914
You are acting as the subject.
Should act like that till the end.

291
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:22,855
Inform the accounts department
to prepare voucher for me.

292
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,226
Embalming dead body.

293
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:25,250
Okay. I will tell them to pay you.
- Yes.

294
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:28,503
Muthaiah!
- Call me father, with love.

295
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,783
Oh, should I!

296
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:31,358
He is a doctor who said
he loves you.

297
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:32,746
He is an eligible bachelor.

298
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:35,499
You are eligible. Right?
- Yes.

299
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:37,628
You took him to embalming
demo and made him faint.

300
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,547
It is very sadistic
and you need counseling.

301
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,063
What? Counseling?

302
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,302
For me or for Chandrababu?

303
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:46,966
For you.

304
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,513
Nageshbabu

305
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:54,203
you are the friend, philosopher,
guide and uncle to Vani.

306
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,246
Now your poor girl needs counseling.

307
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,046
It is because of you.
- There has been

308
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:02,787
not a single love allegation
against her since 1st year.

309
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:06,871
Now a doctor confessed his
love for her and she made him faint.

310
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:08,480
I will send her now.

311
00:18:13,964 --> 00:18:17,183
You love the dean's daughter
but you are very timid.

312
00:18:17,951 --> 00:18:19,191
What sort of a boy are you?

313
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:21,188
You don't know how
to impress a girl.

314
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:22,918
Okay.

315
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,839
Did you understand what I meant
when I asked if you are eligible?

316
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:28,175
No, doctor. I did not understand.

317
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:34,126
If you are innocent like a sparrow,
people will cheat you.

318
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:36,482
By the way do you know
about 'sparrow medicine'?

319
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:39,023
Are we going to get this
question in final semester?

320
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,958
Chandrababu is a coward.

321
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:45,882
He doesn't attend practical anatomy.

322
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:47,563
You have been seeing
it since 4 years.

323
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:49,224
Still you scared him.

324
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:51,757
If he takes some drastic step?

325
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:53,697
You will suffer from guilt.

326
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:55,228
What shall I do now?

327
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,202
You know how to manage it.

328
00:18:57,282 --> 00:19:01,205
Give him a present
he likes and pamper him.

329
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:07,215
Marketraja killed Perambuli
when I was in jail for 7 years.

330
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:09,626
But you are supporting him.

331
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:15,660
Now that I have come back,
my 1st assignment is to kill Market.

332
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:17,802
Then let us work together.

333
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:21,823
Market, we should be together.

334
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,614
Mari is coming to Government
hospital for a blood check up.

335
00:19:27,694 --> 00:19:30,615
Remove the entire
blood from his body.

336
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,440
Okay. We can take out.

337
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:36,753
His entire blood is bad,
Kaduvulappa.

338
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:40,120
Kadavulappa? Kadavulappa!

339
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,600
Why are you using a new name?

340
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,282
Godfather. Kadavulappa means that.
- Oh!

341
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:46,223
You are the God who saves me.

342
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,672
Hey! Are you playing hide and seek?

343
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:53,998
She wants to meet you alone
and so she has invited you.

344
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:56,124
Go.
- Yes, the same person.

345
00:19:57,591 --> 00:19:59,694
You are in 1st year. Right?

346
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:00,932
Yes.

347
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,519
Go away. Come on.
- My respect to senior.

348
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,442
Run.

349
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,025
Run.
- All the best.

350
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:06,215
Kick him out of the campus.

351
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:09,856
Two girls elope with a young boy.
- Chandrababu! We both are seniors.

352
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:13,025
He is after all a 1st year
student but he is ragging you.

353
00:20:13,105 --> 00:20:14,380
You are a coward.

354
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:22,710
Chandrababu, I am not teasing you.

355
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:26,376
I want to make you feel ease.
Play it.

356
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:43,863
Do not play a love song.
It sounds horrible.

357
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:45,893
Play some other tune.

358
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:12,885
Power cut.

359
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:15,546
It smells like a dead body.
Let us show light from mobile.

360
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:16,835
Bad smell.

361
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:21,699
Hey!

362
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,408
It is a male corpse.

363
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,441
Hey!

364
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:08,330
Hey!

365
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,780
Oh, God!

366
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:37,663
Help!

367
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:48,126
Oh, God! Help! He is hitting us!

368
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:58,107
Don't come near. Will kill him.

369
00:23:58,528 --> 00:23:59,472
Go away.

370
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:01,460
Blood will ooze out of his neck.
Go away.

371
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,364
As a doctor I have
seen lot of blood.

372
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,602
Done many operations and seen death.

373
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:09,324
I have cut human
bodies while studying.

374
00:24:09,404 --> 00:24:10,559
MBBS degree cannot
be obtained easily.

375
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:12,531
The operation knife is here.
It can cut a body easily.

376
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,200
Will do it very smoothly.

377
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:16,077
I don't know who this doctor is.

378
00:24:16,157 --> 00:24:20,225
I will attack you whether
you kill him or not.

379
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:21,880
Will give you a chance.

380
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,394
Leave this place.

381
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:25,292
There are cameras all over.

382
00:24:34,712 --> 00:24:38,622
The body of a person they
killed has come up for postmortem.

383
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,040
They want a certificate
saying he committed suicide.

384
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:42,978
They think doctors are timid.

385
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,118
No. I will join another hospital.

386
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:52,357
Vani!

387
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,235
Thank him.

388
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:58,119
Thank you, doctor.
- Alright.

389
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:04,116
Kaduvulappa. Yes. Job done.

390
00:25:05,118 --> 00:25:09,247
But Guna and Jabamani escaped.

391
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:10,482
Well done.

392
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:14,166
You are my outsourcing son.

393
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:19,829
But I am a devil.

394
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:26,672
Bye. I will come.

395
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:37,059
Eat well.

396
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:41,833
Okay madam. I will keep it.

397
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:47,087
Hey! Come.

398
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:08,642
Food.
- I have eaten.

399
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,700
It was neither spicy nor tasty.
College canteen.

400
00:26:22,283 --> 00:26:23,806
What is it?

401
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:29,680
Should I check her?

402
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:33,259
Is it paining?
- No...

403
00:26:37,272 --> 00:26:39,660
Should check your BP.

404
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,805
Come to hospital.
- Alright.

405
00:26:40,885 --> 00:26:41,804
You can get the check
up done for free.

406
00:26:41,884 --> 00:26:42,785
Okay.

407
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,471
Doctor has told me.

408
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:58,472
Are you able to hear
her calling your name?

409
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,207
She is asking

410
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,497
if I am able to hear
you calling my name.

411
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:09,148
She is very happy that
her son is studying medicine.

412
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:53,092
I have got information
that vigilance people

413
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:54,241
from All India Medical Council

414
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:55,542
are going to make
a surprise visit here.

415
00:28:55,622 --> 00:28:57,929
So be alert.
Do not sleep. As you usually do.

416
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,458
Go.
- Okay doctor.

417
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,054
Yes, doctor...
- I am not a doctor.

418
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:08,336
A don!
- Don?

419
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:11,651
Don't you understand? Dada.

420
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:12,593
Dada?

421
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:14,035
You must have heard of Market.

422
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:15,461
No.
- Then hear it now.

423
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,144
Radha is on line.

424
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:22,706
Yes, Ms Radha.

425
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:25,215
Sorry. Sir...

426
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,700
Sir, how can I do it?

427
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:30,074
Sir...

428
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:31,583
It is atrocious.

429
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:33,633
He is telling me
to mark the extra corpse

430
00:29:33,713 --> 00:29:35,656
in the mortuary under
Sec 174 as unclaimed corpse.

431
00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:38,504
I killed that person. Sign here.

432
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:40,990
Okay sir. We will do it.

433
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,727
Sir, will you please
extend my term as dean?

434
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:46,858
Okay, sir. Okay, sir.
Thank you, sir.

435
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:51,133
I am not saying that
I am an honest dean.

436
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:52,847
Political pressure.

437
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:57,501
Sundaram!
- Yes, doctor.

438
00:29:58,444 --> 00:29:59,817
Sir, greetings.
- Okay...

439
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,241
He is Perambur don.

440
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:03,339
Is it?
- Yes.

441
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:05,391
Give this in office
and take his sign!

442
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,801
Get lost.
- Okay, doctor.

443
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:07,821
Don, my foot!

444
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:20,480
Doctor, wait.

445
00:30:21,128 --> 00:30:22,336
Doctor.

446
00:30:24,746 --> 00:30:26,035
Red signal to us!

447
00:30:26,748 --> 00:30:30,409
My fellow lawyers are
jealous that I am with you.

448
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:32,386
They are trying to
jeopardize my career

449
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:33,879
but are not able to do. Oh, God!

450
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,390
I got you, doctor.

451
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,797
Why are you dashing the car
against a stool? - Move.

452
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:38,800
Thank God.

453
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:41,105
No. Thank you, signal.

454
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:44,720
Do only boys fall
in love at first sight?

455
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,520
Even girls can fall in love.

456
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:50,728
I liked you the moment I saw you.

457
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:53,518
She is irritating
me by calling me doctor.

458
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:55,590
Why don't you give her
injection and send her off?

459
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:59,077
If a person who can hold
a knife and cut is a doctor

460
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,149
then even I am a doctor.

461
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:01,520
Do not irritate me.

462
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,270
A girl is considered
cheap if she proposes first.

463
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,384
Who is that?

464
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:10,457
Get down.

465
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,469
I will taunt you if you mock me.

466
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:13,739
Correct.

467
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:17,005
If I love you,
even you will love me.

468
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,267
We should kidnap her.

469
00:31:18,347 --> 00:31:19,917
You come in Scooty.

470
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:22,244
Injection?
- Yes.

471
00:31:22,324 --> 00:31:23,245
Right!

472
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:40,876
Wait.

473
00:31:41,717 --> 00:31:44,688
She is Anjalai,
our security check-in.

474
00:31:45,595 --> 00:31:46,428
Lift your hand.

475
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:48,552
You are touching
her more than a man!

476
00:31:48,857 --> 00:31:49,849
Leave it.

477
00:31:50,949 --> 00:31:53,278
Is she the girl about
whom Market told us?

478
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:54,399
Go.

479
00:31:58,397 --> 00:32:01,173
Good. You have dressed
up appropriately.

480
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,518
Have you touched her?

481
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:12,188
Go in. All of you get out of here

482
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:15,144
Guest has come. Go.

483
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,128
Yes, it is a girl. Go away.

484
00:32:17,787 --> 00:32:18,764
Hey!

485
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:21,592
Hello!

486
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:26,205
Sir, the Ice bar will
melt in half an hour.

487
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:27,388
You will get only that much time.

488
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:29,823
Doctor!
- Suck his blood.

489
00:32:30,217 --> 00:32:33,043
He will die. He will die.
- Hello! See here, Doctor!

490
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,125
Hello!

491
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:45,094
Hello! Please help.

492
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:57,677
What happened?

493
00:32:57,757 --> 00:32:59,755
The person who filed case
is dead but the case is still there.

494
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:03,314
See who has come.

495
00:33:03,976 --> 00:33:06,539
Subbaram!

496
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:09,431
It seems you left our
collection department.

497
00:33:09,511 --> 00:33:11,316
Brother, I draw well.

498
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:14,124
I have now joined an art college.
I draw well.

499
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:16,210
Can you draw me?
- Yes, brother.

500
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,125
If your picture of mine makes
Das and others to respect it.

501
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,880
I can do it.
- You can do whatever you want.

502
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,230
But if you do not
draw my face properly

503
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,974
you should be in collection.

504
00:33:25,054 --> 00:33:25,952
Draw.
- Okay.

505
00:33:26,032 --> 00:33:28,385
I will pose. Is it okay?
- Yes.

506
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:43,235
Please do not kill him.

507
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:45,832
Varada, check whether
he has drawn properly.

508
00:33:46,706 --> 00:33:47,829
I have finished.

509
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:49,623
How is it?

510
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:53,905
He has drawn very well.

511
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:55,792
Looks exactly like Market.

512
00:33:55,872 --> 00:33:58,501
Does it look like me?
- Brother! No...

513
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:03,064
Does it look like me?
- No. It is You.

514
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:05,876
Varada!

515
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:07,522
Your taunt is also realistic.

516
00:34:07,602 --> 00:34:09,626
Your eyes look as
if you are staring at me.

517
00:34:09,706 --> 00:34:11,588
Shut up. See the painting and say.
Painting is over there.

518
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:13,986
He is original.
- Both are same.

519
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:15,692
It must be right if you say.

520
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,318
et me kill him.

521
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:19,683
No! Oh, God!
- I said something is missing.

522
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,898
Tell me whether I should kill him.

523
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,173
Say.
- No!

524
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:24,608
I will shoot him.
- Brother!

525
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,390
He will kill him.
- Shoot!

526
00:34:29,718 --> 00:34:32,278
Saved one candle!

527
00:34:32,796 --> 00:34:34,302
Come. Let us go home.

528
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:38,792
Shall I smoke?

529
00:34:38,872 --> 00:34:40,245
This is real comedy.

530
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:42,996
It was really jovial

531
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:46,603
'After many days the cinema
setting is going to be let out.'

532
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:48,899
Doctor girl, say now.

533
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:53,944
Am I a doctor or a don?

534
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:58,935
Are you thirsty?

535
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:02,756
Are you feeling hungry?
Yes. You must be hungry.

536
00:35:03,138 --> 00:35:05,657
Only then you will understand.

537
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,538
Varada!
- Yes?

538
00:35:07,618 --> 00:35:08,466
Who am I?

539
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:10,315
Real dada.

540
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:12,787
Don with ISI stamp.

541
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:13,974
Did you hear?

542
00:35:14,054 --> 00:35:15,570
I have railway contract.

543
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,374
The entire area is afraid of me.

544
00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:20,077
Loving a rowdy can
happen only in movies.

545
00:35:20,157 --> 00:35:23,934
Because the real hero goes
back to a bungalow after shooting.

546
00:35:24,678 --> 00:35:29,232
Das, tell her the fate of
the Marwari girl who loved Kumar.

547
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,374
He died in the 3rd month.

548
00:35:34,107 --> 00:35:36,310
He was killed in public.

549
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,401
She married in January
and lost her husband in March.

550
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,602
That girl did not
go back to her house.

551
00:35:41,163 --> 00:35:43,448
She is with me now.

552
00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:46,718
Is that why you are speaking hindi?

553
00:35:46,798 --> 00:35:48,461
Yes. Can speak well.

554
00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:50,360
Even I need a girl.

555
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:51,878
But they are of different type.

556
00:35:52,147 --> 00:35:57,581
I will call over phone and they
dress up and come to this terrace.

557
00:35:57,661 --> 00:36:00,965
They lie on me and drink liquor.
And they leave at night.

558
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:03,116
Because they look
horrible in the morning!

559
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:04,775
Send her home in Scooty.

560
00:36:04,855 --> 00:36:06,892
Check whether she
reaches home safely.

561
00:36:06,972 --> 00:36:08,336
She is from an elite family.
Not suited for me.

562
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,549
She thinks I am a doctor.

563
00:36:09,806 --> 00:36:10,645
Get lost.

564
00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:12,629
Hello!

565
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:16,404
Can we eat an ice cream photo?

566
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:17,711
You are like that.

567
00:36:18,038 --> 00:36:19,061
You are an ice cream photo.

568
00:36:19,557 --> 00:36:20,384
Cheers.

569
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,280
What?

570
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,914
You have come for counseling.
Do you love a don?

571
00:36:31,115 --> 00:36:32,688
What is wrong?

572
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:36,568
I love this don character.

573
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,513
He says he doesn't like me.
I like his honesty.

574
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:42,232
Has he told that
he doesn't like you?

575
00:36:42,312 --> 00:36:43,593
But I like him.

576
00:36:43,673 --> 00:36:44,519
What?

577
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:46,297
Mr Nagesh.
- What?

578
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:48,168
You should not tell this to Shivaji.

579
00:36:49,445 --> 00:36:51,248
Please...

580
00:36:57,802 --> 00:36:59,428
Sula Jabamani and Guna.

581
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:00,963
What will you drink?

582
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,247
I have liquor.

583
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,083
Duty free.

584
00:37:04,586 --> 00:37:05,505
Shall I ask him to get?

585
00:37:05,585 --> 00:37:06,608
No need.

586
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:08,469
Instead give us poison.

587
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:10,156
Poison!

588
00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:12,095
Stock over.

589
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:15,760
Boss, our parties
have the same ideology.

590
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,996
Only our physical
appearance is different.

591
00:37:18,581 --> 00:37:19,864
Do not say poetry.

592
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:22,575
Looks like you just missed it.

593
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:24,704
Not just missed. We just escaped.

594
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:29,048
Oh! Heard that your Minister
will also be sent to jail.

595
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:30,817
Who? Ramdas?
- Yes.

596
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:33,525
He will never do it.

597
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,668
Tell him to die.

598
00:37:36,331 --> 00:37:40,451
The person who came to kill
us is Marketraja, your favorite.

599
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:42,308
Do you say I planned it?

600
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:45,372
I only cut the nails.

601
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:46,532
Even we mean the same.

602
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:48,974
We are nails and
Marketraja is your flesh.

603
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:50,769
Come to the point.

604
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:54,189
Got information that Marketraja
is going to celebrate his birthday.

605
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:57,508
His birthday should
be his death day.

606
00:37:57,787 --> 00:37:59,370
We need your permission for that.

607
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,963
I will not permit it.
Tell your minister.

608
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:05,867
Oh! You mean you will
not allow your flesh to be cut.

609
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:08,036
You said so.

610
00:38:08,116 --> 00:38:09,835
We survived with great difficulty.

611
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,953
You will not speak like this if you
had escaped attempt on your life.

612
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:15,360
I like a chasing person more
than the person who is running.

613
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,448
Useless fellow!

614
00:38:18,605 --> 00:38:20,915
If you disobey me and
plan to kill Marketraja

615
00:38:20,995 --> 00:38:24,954
I will inform the Home department
to kill you in encounter.

616
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:30,224
We understand. We will leave now.
- Yes.

617
00:38:30,304 --> 00:38:31,791
We will not kill Marketraja now.

618
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,541
The place of his
birthday celebration

619
00:38:37,621 --> 00:38:39,765
is area between two police stations.

620
00:38:39,845 --> 00:38:44,118
We are ready to kill
Marketraj at the right time.

621
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:46,159
Okay. I will speak to commissioner.

622
00:38:52,554 --> 00:38:54,104
Hello, mike testing.

623
00:38:54,428 --> 00:38:58,048
A rowdy sometimes becomes curious.

624
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:01,767
So I act as if I am
dead to have that feeling.

625
00:39:01,847 --> 00:39:04,210
Every rowdy has a history.

626
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:05,687
Even I have.

627
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:07,609
History of don. Shall I say?

628
00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:09,740
Once upon a time

629
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:13,172
I was left floating
in a boat in a drain.

630
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:14,074
He came floating.

631
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:15,877
I was roaming without a penny.

632
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:17,992
He stole the whiskey
bottle at that time.

633
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:20,804
Come on! Come on!

634
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:23,713
I was 10 years old then.

635
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:24,977
He was smart at that age.

636
00:39:25,057 --> 00:39:28,291
He sold others properties...
- And amassed wealth.

637
00:39:28,371 --> 00:39:30,912
I was an ordinary person then.
Now...

638
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:36,842
Well done.

639
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:41,873
Continue...

640
00:39:42,657 --> 00:39:44,511
I was eighteen.
- What happened?

641
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,156
I was attacked at that time.
- Continue.

642
00:39:47,236 --> 00:39:48,834
I fought with them
and drove them away.

643
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:50,651
He turned and saw a girl.

644
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:51,967
He saw her.

645
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:55,213
She left her husband
and came to him.

646
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,750
Hey! I was an ordinary person then.

647
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,247
But now?

648
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:01,719
Continue...

649
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,635
Continue...

650
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:26,465
Continue...

651
00:40:26,545 --> 00:40:29,726
I was used to killing
people by the time I was 21.

652
00:40:29,806 --> 00:40:31,309
Started earning lot of money.

653
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:34,375
A girl entered my heart
at that time. - Wow!

654
00:40:34,455 --> 00:40:39,206
"She was very beautiful."

655
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:44,029
"Suitable for me."

656
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,743
I told her that I love her.

657
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:47,565
I gave her a rose
expressing my love.

658
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,000
And she accepted it.

659
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,829
Suddenly another
man entered her life.

660
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,174
And I was heartbroken.

661
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:21,963
Get lost!

662
00:41:44,523 --> 00:41:47,331
When I walk people
used to get scared of me.

663
00:41:47,411 --> 00:41:49,779
Enemies come near me with fear.

664
00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:52,967
I lived as I wanted.

665
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:55,331
I became a don.

666
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,402
Where are you? Inspectors, where
are you? Come here immediately.

667
00:42:37,482 --> 00:42:38,750
Over. Over. Over.

668
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,512
You both wanted posting in a station
where you can get more bribe.

669
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:44,750
I helped you get millions
of loan amount from Nathuram Seth

670
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:48,491
without interest, for the
kickbacks that you had to pay.

671
00:42:48,571 --> 00:42:52,245
But now both of you have
not repaid even a penny to him.

672
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:53,384
Shall I tell one thing?

673
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:54,885
It is not my birthday today.

674
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:59,268
You were in a hurry to target me
without checking the police records.

675
00:42:59,348 --> 00:43:00,619
I tricked you to come here.

676
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:04,542
You used political pressure
to nab Marketraja through Police.

677
00:43:04,622 --> 00:43:05,711
Marketraja!

678
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:10,109
Now he has got hold
of two inspectors.

679
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:15,663
Hello, who is that?
- Mudi.

680
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:17,551
Some Mudi is speaking.

681
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,382
Hello, Minister Ramdas speaking.

682
00:43:22,462 --> 00:43:25,069
You are a big shot.
Why do you want to speak to me?

683
00:43:25,149 --> 00:43:26,745
You are acting high handedly.

684
00:43:27,478 --> 00:43:29,570
Release the inspectors.
Then come and see me.

685
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:30,698
We can discuss and solve the matter.

686
00:43:31,115 --> 00:43:33,074
I have a meeting in half an hour.

687
00:43:33,154 --> 00:43:37,065
Minister, come to spectrum
mall terrace, if you have guts.

688
00:43:37,145 --> 00:43:38,212
We can discuss there.

689
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:40,772
The police matter will
leak out if you do not come.

690
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,672
I am sure you will not come.

691
00:43:45,518 --> 00:43:46,944
What is he saying?

692
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,431
He said he will apologize to me

693
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:50,225
if I go to spectrum mall
and release the inspectors.

694
00:43:52,357 --> 00:43:55,776
I will come to the
meeting directly. You go.

695
00:43:55,856 --> 00:43:58,415
Alright, sir. Come in time.
Lots of things to discuss.

696
00:43:58,495 --> 00:43:59,431
Go!

697
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:13,385
Minister, come here. Come here.

698
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:24,384
Have you seen the movie

699
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:27,363
where the hero and heroine
get trapped in lift like this?

700
00:44:27,443 --> 00:44:33,711
"He should be borne again to do it!"

701
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:34,944
Where is Marketraja?

702
00:44:35,254 --> 00:44:37,419
He is up there.
Climb through the ladder.

703
00:44:37,965 --> 00:44:39,258
This is the symbol of opposition!
I will not use it.

704
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,401
Marketraja!

705
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,218
I am getting late for
the committee meeting.

706
00:44:43,442 --> 00:44:44,283
Come down fast.

707
00:44:44,987 --> 00:44:45,954
He will not answer.

708
00:44:46,034 --> 00:44:48,706
You join hands with
any party if you want.

709
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:49,877
Climb the ladder.

710
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:56,477
Oh! Have you hid the phone?

711
00:44:59,548 --> 00:45:01,757
Wait and see what I do.

712
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:03,617
Watch it.

713
00:45:03,998 --> 00:45:05,942
It is shaking. Shall I hold it?

714
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,768
What?
- Ladder is moving. Shall I hold it?

715
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,098
Marketraja! How dare you?

716
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:25,162
Are you behaving highhandedly
because of Radha's support?

717
00:45:25,242 --> 00:45:27,659
Are you playing politics
with a politician?

718
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,087
I was running a cycle
shop in my initial days.

719
00:45:31,654 --> 00:45:33,492
Cycle chain was my first weapon.

720
00:45:33,572 --> 00:45:37,514
I was a notorious rowdy
even before you were born.

721
00:45:37,797 --> 00:45:42,010
Listen! Release the inspectors.

722
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:44,029
Okay, sir.

723
00:45:46,712 --> 00:45:49,214
Das, release the inspectors.

724
00:45:49,638 --> 00:45:50,545
Minister has come here.

725
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:52,139
Is it okay, sir?

726
00:45:53,182 --> 00:45:54,953
That is good.
- Oh, God!

727
00:45:55,033 --> 00:45:56,271
Tell Radha not to come in my way.

728
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,489
Drop him and join me.

729
00:45:57,569 --> 00:45:59,080
You will be more powerful.

730
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,065
I have to go now. Bye.

731
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:08,860
Where is the ladder?
I want to get down.

732
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,081
Your discussion has been a failure.

733
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:12,707
Stupid, give the ladder.

734
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:14,411
Minister!

735
00:46:15,676 --> 00:46:17,610
Have you finished talking?

736
00:46:18,871 --> 00:46:20,950
Come and sit here.

737
00:46:30,314 --> 00:46:31,808
Let us come to the point.

738
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:34,537
You pay 60 million rupees
which the inspectors owe.

739
00:46:34,617 --> 00:46:35,417
Then you may go.

740
00:46:35,497 --> 00:46:38,329
Hey! I have got committee
meeting now. Do not play with me.

741
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:41,656
Brother, catch. Good catch.

742
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:44,565
This is not a game for me.
It is my job.

743
00:46:45,022 --> 00:46:47,154
Why did you interfere in my work?

744
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:50,643
Take your phone.
Call someone and tell them to bring.

745
00:46:57,771 --> 00:47:00,930
Steffani, it is me. RD speaking.

746
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:01,932
Yes.

747
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:03,964
I want 60 million rupees now.
It is urgent.

748
00:47:04,214 --> 00:47:05,486
It is in the numbered suitcase.

749
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:07,090
Send your man. She will give.

750
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,324
Steffani!

751
00:47:09,131 --> 00:47:11,373
The name sounds romantic!

752
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,541
Steffani! Steffani!

753
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:15,326
Tell her to bring the money here.

754
00:47:15,406 --> 00:47:16,226
She will not come.

755
00:47:16,306 --> 00:47:17,445
Will tell her to
send through driver.

756
00:47:17,525 --> 00:47:21,039
No. I want Steffani.
She should bring.

757
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,527
Hey, Marketraja!

758
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:25,397
Which is more important?

759
00:47:25,477 --> 00:47:27,197
60 million rupees
or should Steffani bring it?

760
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,430
Do not waste my time.

761
00:47:28,819 --> 00:47:31,724
I am not wasting the time.
You are wasting.

762
00:47:31,804 --> 00:47:32,828
Don't you have meeting now?

763
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:35,544
You do not want me
to see Staffani. Right?

764
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:37,268
Okay. I will cover my eyes.

765
00:47:40,182 --> 00:47:41,870
Steffani! Steffani!

766
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:45,044
I cannot see you. It is my fate.

767
00:48:26,636 --> 00:48:28,048
Oh, God!

768
00:48:28,128 --> 00:48:29,974
Steffani! Steffani!

769
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,192
I am sorry. Extremely sorry.
- I will not say sorry.

770
00:48:32,582 --> 00:48:33,499
Can we go?

771
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:36,004
Yes. Only you can go.

772
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:37,715
Marketraja!

773
00:48:38,813 --> 00:48:41,112
This is my trick.

774
00:48:42,591 --> 00:48:45,801
I am unable to see Steffani.

775
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,675
You please go.
It is time for your meeting.

776
00:49:12,055 --> 00:49:13,707
Boss! I told you.

777
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:15,778
But you did not listen.

778
00:49:17,414 --> 00:49:19,034
Why have you come late?

779
00:49:19,114 --> 00:49:20,389
I said we have problem.

780
00:49:20,469 --> 00:49:22,359
But you did not listen.

781
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:24,526
You have been removed
from the minister's post.

782
00:49:24,606 --> 00:49:26,598
CM told you to meet
him in party office.

783
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:29,850
'So we hereby inform'

784
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:33,575
'that no one should approach
him for party matter.'

785
00:49:33,655 --> 00:49:38,495
'If you disobey action
will be taken by the party'.

786
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:41,493
Please come.
- Sir, please come.

787
00:49:41,573 --> 00:49:42,914
Please come.
- Bless me.

788
00:49:43,477 --> 00:49:44,730
Please come.

789
00:49:45,408 --> 00:49:46,643
Play music.

790
00:49:50,043 --> 00:49:52,007
Sir, please come.
- Please come.

791
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,646
Play music.

792
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:58,979
May you lead a good life!
Thanks brother.

793
00:50:19,381 --> 00:50:21,560
Take. Take.

794
00:50:23,828 --> 00:50:27,251
Godfather, you are my life.

795
00:50:30,253 --> 00:50:32,214
Thanks.

796
00:50:33,854 --> 00:50:36,444
It is because of you.
- You have multiplied my earnings.

797
00:50:36,524 --> 00:50:39,110
You said and I did it.

798
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:40,717
Well done.

799
00:50:43,631 --> 00:50:44,592
Play music.

800
00:51:00,922 --> 00:51:01,807
What is it?

801
00:51:01,887 --> 00:51:03,207
Useless fellows.

802
00:51:03,287 --> 00:51:05,310
You have brought shame
to the department. - Daddy, time?

803
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:06,603
9.7, dear.

804
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,697
You may go. Meet me after
your suspension period is over.

805
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:11,889
Home secretary is
presiding over the enquiry.

806
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:16,091
Till then take care of your kid.
Now get lost.

807
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:21,916
We are not able to handle
an accused officially.

808
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,166
What sort of a police are we?

809
00:51:24,135 --> 00:51:25,140
But Walter...
- Sir,

810
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,133
I am not an unworthy commissioner.

811
00:51:27,213 --> 00:51:29,151
Wait and watch. I have a plan.

812
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:30,684
Walter!
- Sir.

813
00:51:30,764 --> 00:51:32,016
Can you identify him?

814
00:51:37,671 --> 00:51:39,602
Manohar Singh

815
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,670
the great encounter
cop of Jharkhand.

816
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:44,326
Police academy is
full of his laurels.

817
00:51:44,814 --> 00:51:46,315
Correct. He is my friend.

818
00:51:47,216 --> 00:51:49,988
He was enjoying his
retired life in Jharkhand.

819
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:51,755
I called him secretly.

820
00:51:53,025 --> 00:51:54,125
Manohar sir!

821
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,353
You have to encounter
Marketraja secretly.

822
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:02,401
If we include his name in list

823
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:06,596
we are forced to remove
it because of political pressure.

824
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:09,316
He has Radha's support.

825
00:52:09,612 --> 00:52:13,540
He has used Minister Ramdas
and so he lost his post.

826
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,583
He held our inspectors as hostage.
Shame on us.

827
00:52:16,897 --> 00:52:20,466
That is why we want
you to kill Marketraja.

828
00:52:21,335 --> 00:52:23,101
He is Walter and he will
be with you. - Sir.

829
00:52:28,215 --> 00:52:29,030
Oh!
- Greetings, sir.

830
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:30,328
Marketraja!
- Greetings, sir.

831
00:52:30,994 --> 00:52:32,127
Das, you may go.

832
00:52:32,207 --> 00:52:34,024
I have some personal
work with Marketraja.

833
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,297
Come.
- You go.

834
00:52:39,545 --> 00:52:42,152
I called you here in private.

835
00:52:42,232 --> 00:52:43,826
Even sent out Das.

836
00:52:43,906 --> 00:52:45,407
There is an important
reason for that.

837
00:52:45,487 --> 00:52:47,971
This is my hotel. Come in.

838
00:52:48,901 --> 00:52:50,039
Sir, I will be here.

839
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:52,346
Go down and sit near
the security camera.

840
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:54,644
I have some secret information.

841
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,203
If I am your Godfather,
you are my Godson.

842
00:52:57,439 --> 00:53:03,340
I have amassed land, bonds

843
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,090
and wealth of

844
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:12,704
around 5.5 billion.

845
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,842
I suspect there will be a raid.

846
00:53:15,503 --> 00:53:17,336
I have put everything
inside a Benz van

847
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,160
and parked it in hotel basement.

848
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:22,040
I will go to Dubai

849
00:53:22,437 --> 00:53:24,021
return after ten days and take them.

850
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:25,852
Alright.
- Hey Marketraja!

851
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:30,962
Let us have a secret code word.

852
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:32,928
Liquor. Okay?

853
00:53:33,008 --> 00:53:34,203
Liquor?
- Yes.

854
00:53:34,283 --> 00:53:36,320
It is simple, like in movies.

855
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,941
It is between us.

856
00:53:38,408 --> 00:53:40,385
Entertaining word.

857
00:53:40,465 --> 00:53:41,855
Liquor.

858
00:53:41,935 --> 00:53:42,978
Liquor. Okay.

859
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:47,563
Marketraja!

860
00:53:48,217 --> 00:53:50,707
It is my life! Be careful.

861
00:54:35,948 --> 00:54:38,444
New furniture is being unloaded.

862
00:54:39,261 --> 00:54:42,776
You were missing the whole night
and have come back with a sofa.

863
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:47,225
Why did Radha call you?

864
00:54:47,305 --> 00:54:48,543
Oh, you want to know!

865
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,636
He has not seen metro rail.

866
00:54:52,104 --> 00:54:53,163
So he took me.

867
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,438
Then why did he send me out?

868
00:54:55,518 --> 00:54:57,088
Even I have not seen metro rail.

869
00:54:58,342 --> 00:55:00,425
From where did you get this sofa?

870
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:02,482
It is for me.

871
00:55:02,562 --> 00:55:04,851
Hey! Get up.
- Don't shoot.

872
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:06,081
Who is the boss here? You or I?

873
00:55:06,161 --> 00:55:07,636
Are you a great lawyer?
- Wait.

874
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:14,768
This was gifted by Steffani.

875
00:55:14,848 --> 00:55:16,522
Nobody other than
me should sit on this.

876
00:55:16,602 --> 00:55:18,505
Nobody should even touch it.

877
00:55:18,585 --> 00:55:20,344
Alright.
- You better understand.

878
00:55:20,754 --> 00:55:22,189
Steffani's sofa.

879
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,878
Here is your daughter-in-law.

880
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:33,062
Welcome doctor.

881
00:55:33,142 --> 00:55:37,740
She said that you love Raja.
Is it so?

882
00:55:38,097 --> 00:55:40,103
No... Yes.

883
00:55:40,183 --> 00:55:41,958
I can't express it.

884
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:44,402
Shall we talk about
marriage or love?

885
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:47,777
Oh, God!
No. I will not marry immediately.

886
00:55:47,857 --> 00:55:52,123
Oh! You want to
mingle and then marry.

887
00:55:52,203 --> 00:55:53,081
Yes.

888
00:55:54,498 --> 00:55:59,125
I want to see him,
mingle, understand...

889
00:55:59,205 --> 00:56:01,108
That's right.

890
00:56:01,188 --> 00:56:04,482
He will not refuse me.

891
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:06,767
Alright. Alright.

892
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:08,919
Let us have a deal.

893
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:12,688
What will you give me if I tell him?

894
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,124
Give you?

895
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:18,597
Will you give me 12 bangles,
6 bangles each for my hands?

896
00:56:19,555 --> 00:56:23,446
Okay. I will give you
2 bangles in advance. Take.

897
00:56:29,454 --> 00:56:33,378
Hey! Prepare crab gravy.
I will go and meet Raja.

898
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:34,503
My dear!

899
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:47,337
Is Raja there?

900
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:48,998
No.
- No?

901
00:56:49,078 --> 00:56:51,648
Give that. Yes.

902
00:56:53,632 --> 00:56:56,421
Do you know that doctor girl?

903
00:56:56,964 --> 00:56:59,217
Yes. Raja had locked her upstairs.

904
00:56:59,297 --> 00:57:00,905
You should not
disclose such things.

905
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:04,177
That girl loves Raja.

906
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:09,420
Look, I have worn the bangles.

907
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,846
So you do one thing.

908
00:57:12,675 --> 00:57:18,205
You tell Raja about her
so that he starts loving her.

909
00:57:18,515 --> 00:57:22,881
Tell Raja that I came
to give this crab gravy.

910
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:24,892
Alright.
- Now it is your game.

911
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:29,860
I drove out that girl.
Why do you want to help her?

912
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,832
How much money did
you take from her?

913
00:57:32,254 --> 00:57:33,462
I will hit you.

914
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,355
That girl is standing outside.

915
00:57:36,435 --> 00:57:38,006
Do not talk about love.

916
00:57:38,086 --> 00:57:40,657
Tell him to beat
me without making noise.

917
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,536
Alright. - You will listen
only if I thrash you.

918
00:57:44,616 --> 00:57:46,537
Okay. I will not make any sound.

919
00:57:48,368 --> 00:57:49,646
Will you ever do this again?

920
00:57:49,726 --> 00:57:51,477
Will you ever do this again?
- One, two, three...

921
00:57:51,557 --> 00:57:54,038
Can you bear my slaps?

922
00:58:10,231 --> 00:58:12,431
Raja feels very shy.

923
00:58:12,511 --> 00:58:16,273
Nobody has seen him feeling so shy.

924
00:58:16,353 --> 00:58:17,534
But...
- But?

925
00:58:19,335 --> 00:58:20,988
He has some hesitation.

926
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:24,857
He is worried about the
difference in status between you.

927
00:58:24,937 --> 00:58:26,673
He asked whether it is possible.

928
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,795
Why not? Come. I will speak to him.
- Wait.

929
00:58:29,985 --> 00:58:33,731
'Love' is new to him.

930
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:37,805
But I told him that love
happens without caring for status.

931
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:42,150
It is like a small
child on a mother's lap.

932
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,826
I told him that he is your love.

933
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:48,195
What did he say?

934
00:58:48,574 --> 00:58:54,021
He said he likes you very much.
But asked you to wait.

935
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:57,749
He will make up his mind
and then start loving you.

936
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:07,080
Please tell him to look
at me and say that he loves me.

937
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,705
Don't bother. This is not a cinema.

938
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:13,130
Everything is okay. Come on.

939
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,212
There is a 4 storey
building in Perambur.

940
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:20,060
The owner dances with
film actresses in TV.

941
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,173
Let us go and see.
- Sundaribai is a liar.

942
00:59:23,465 --> 00:59:24,803
Look how she bluffs!

943
00:59:24,883 --> 00:59:26,752
No one will respect her
if she doesn't talk like this.

944
00:59:26,832 --> 00:59:28,297
But I feel pity
for that doctor girl.

945
01:00:26,567 --> 01:00:27,736
Why are you singing this theme?

946
01:00:28,821 --> 01:00:29,963
It is irritating.

947
01:00:32,054 --> 01:00:33,092
It is my feeling.

948
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:35,547
He says it is for his lover.

949
01:00:35,627 --> 01:00:37,750
You are in 1st year. Right?

950
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,478
Instead of ragging him,
why are you ragging me?

951
01:00:40,558 --> 01:00:41,369
Go.

952
01:00:41,594 --> 01:00:42,439
Bye.
- Get lost.

953
01:00:43,141 --> 01:00:44,182
Get lost.
- I will go.

954
01:00:47,817 --> 01:00:48,851
Are you angry with me?

955
01:00:48,931 --> 01:00:53,573
If you had attended
the intern surgery properly

956
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:55,909
you will not blabber like this.

957
01:00:56,465 --> 01:01:00,334
Many lovers are in
love without attending it.

958
01:01:01,144 --> 01:01:01,980
How is it?

959
01:01:02,419 --> 01:01:05,484
Heart is the basis for love.

960
01:01:05,774 --> 01:01:06,706
Bloody heart.

961
01:01:07,371 --> 01:01:10,520
If a person watches a heart surgery

962
01:01:10,848 --> 01:01:14,302
and still falls in love,
that is true love.

963
01:01:16,056 --> 01:01:19,410
When a rowdy,
who kills others, falls in love

964
01:01:20,832 --> 01:01:22,510
it is true love.

965
01:01:23,702 --> 01:01:27,358
Will you love only if I attend it?

966
01:01:27,987 --> 01:01:29,572
You will never understand.

967
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:33,530
Do you have the guts
to see the birth of a baby?

968
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:36,240
Okay. I challenge you.

969
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:39,586
Can you stay fearless

970
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:44,092
in a graveyard at
least for ten minutes?

971
01:01:44,172 --> 01:01:45,309
You are a coward.

972
01:01:50,047 --> 01:01:52,498
'Can you stay fearless'

973
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:56,608
'in a graveyard at
least for ten minutes?'

974
01:01:56,688 --> 01:01:58,401
Why are you worried?

975
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:00,814
This is the graveyard
which your lover mentioned.

976
01:02:00,894 --> 01:02:05,269
You should stay here for one hour

977
01:02:05,568 --> 01:02:07,140
playing your mouthorgan.

978
01:02:07,566 --> 01:02:09,097
We will take a video of it

979
01:02:09,177 --> 01:02:12,165
send it to your lover and
prove that you are not a coward.

980
01:02:12,245 --> 01:02:14,746
What do you say?
- Oh, no. Please.

981
01:02:15,025 --> 01:02:15,880
I will not do it.

982
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,612
How will your love be
successful if you do not do it?

983
01:02:19,249 --> 01:02:21,995
I will attend surgery.
Watch childbirth.

984
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:23,252
But I cannot do this. Please.

985
01:02:27,688 --> 01:02:29,459
Oh, God!

986
01:02:33,006 --> 01:02:34,069
What have you done?

987
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:39,324
My princess gave it to me.

988
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,039
Where did he throw it?

989
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:52,671
I am scared. Please come.

990
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:59,396
Many people are buried there.
They are with you.

991
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:00,764
All of you search
for the mouthorgan.

992
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:02,899
I will go now. Bye.

993
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,527
Hello, Bashir bhai?

994
01:03:09,249 --> 01:03:10,183
Tell me.

995
01:03:54,943 --> 01:03:56,475
Hey! Hey!

996
01:05:14,558 --> 01:05:15,881
Das, where are you?

997
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:20,059
They are shooting me.
I am in the cocoanut grove.

998
01:05:20,369 --> 01:05:22,092
In the graveyard.

999
01:07:26,533 --> 01:07:30,031
Hey! Who are you?

1000
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:31,829
Will kill you.

1001
01:07:40,646 --> 01:07:41,698
Doctor!

1002
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:50,978
Doctor!

1003
01:07:51,227 --> 01:07:55,193
Help me. Help me, doctor.

1004
01:08:20,082 --> 01:08:22,484
He is a civilian.
Medical college student.

1005
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:23,614
college student.
Cross fire.

1006
01:08:24,381 --> 01:08:25,338
Don't know why he came here.

1007
01:08:25,418 --> 01:08:27,095
Both of you leave that place.
- Okay, sir.

1008
01:08:27,175 --> 01:08:28,824
Hold on the operation for some time.
- Yes, sir.

1009
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:29,727
I will take care.

1010
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:37,445
Marketraja!

1011
01:09:34,997 --> 01:09:39,923
Chandrababu!
You have left us and died!

1012
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:48,291
Did she educate you
to see you die so young?

1013
01:09:48,659 --> 01:09:51,020
Your mother used to serve food
to everyone with a smiling face.

1014
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,313
Vani!
- Yes, doctor.

1015
01:09:52,393 --> 01:09:54,328
We are releasing the
body after post mortem.

1016
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,338
Police formalities are there.

1017
01:09:56,582 --> 01:09:58,983
Formalities will be over
only tomorrow. Please tell her.

1018
01:09:59,271 --> 01:10:03,106
They will now handover
his mutilated body.

1019
01:10:03,631 --> 01:10:05,617
Can you bear to see it?

1020
01:10:10,342 --> 01:10:14,496
She can't even speak.

1021
01:10:16,725 --> 01:10:19,698
Forgive me. Please...

1022
01:10:41,621 --> 01:10:46,445
Market! I have brought
breakfast for you.

1023
01:11:58,985 --> 01:12:01,418
Call Guna and Jabamani.

1024
01:12:01,498 --> 01:12:03,008
Where are they?
- Will call them now.

1025
01:12:03,088 --> 01:12:06,120
It was planned by Guna and Jabamani.

1026
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,571
You escaped by a whisker.

1027
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:10,038
They are calling us there.
- Let anyone attack us.

1028
01:12:10,118 --> 01:12:11,886
Let any number of
people come and fight us.

1029
01:12:11,966 --> 01:12:13,843
Marketraja can fight
all of them single handedly.

1030
01:12:13,923 --> 01:12:15,567
Will come...
- They are shooting at the back.

1031
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:17,505
Let them face us boldly.
- All of you will be killed.

1032
01:12:17,585 --> 01:12:19,361
Tell the priest to be ready
to do your final rites. - Right!

1033
01:12:19,441 --> 01:12:22,060
Come. Let us fight them.
Kill them.

1034
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,734
Come there and show your anger.

1035
01:12:46,054 --> 01:12:46,993
Varada!
- Yes.

1036
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,364
They both have come with
the person who has lost his power.

1037
01:12:49,444 --> 01:12:51,261
Still he is sitting
like a powerful man.

1038
01:12:51,341 --> 01:12:53,376
We will get Steffani today also.

1039
01:12:54,725 --> 01:12:55,678
Market can enjoy.

1040
01:12:55,758 --> 01:12:56,903
Yes.
- I will go first.

1041
01:12:56,983 --> 01:12:58,701
I will come if you cannot handle.

1042
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,255
I said I will come with Market.

1043
01:13:01,913 --> 01:13:04,203
Market, your presence
gives us courage.

1044
01:13:04,283 --> 01:13:07,226
Look at the way Das is walking.
Like a lion cub!

1045
01:13:07,306 --> 01:13:10,079
How dare you?

1046
01:13:10,548 --> 01:13:12,586
Are you planning to kill Market?

1047
01:13:12,666 --> 01:13:15,603
Now Marketraja has
come here to kill you.

1048
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:16,681
You are trapped.

1049
01:13:16,761 --> 01:13:18,971
Why are you hiding
behind a useless person?

1050
01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:20,289
Who is the useless person?

1051
01:13:21,051 --> 01:13:23,696
I do not want to insult
the ex-minister by mentioning him.

1052
01:13:23,776 --> 01:13:24,641
Say and then see the consequence.

1053
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:25,936
Guna!
- Shut up.

1054
01:13:26,016 --> 01:13:27,949
Get up. Is anybody providing
free meals here? Get lost.

1055
01:13:28,752 --> 01:13:30,393
Look, you are
attempting to kill him.

1056
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:32,222
I warn you. Do not do so.

1057
01:13:32,597 --> 01:13:33,501
Today our fate will be decided.

1058
01:13:33,581 --> 01:13:35,690
Market has come.

1059
01:13:36,576 --> 01:13:37,838
If you were not here

1060
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:39,958
these two would have
been killed by now.

1061
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:45,264
Das, see who is standing
in front of you.

1062
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:47,766
Tall fellow! What do you say now?
- I know.

1063
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:54,048
Market will start fighting
if he sees anybody harming me.

1064
01:13:54,827 --> 01:13:56,134
Today it will be decided.

1065
01:13:56,214 --> 01:13:57,034
Das is in danger.

1066
01:13:57,114 --> 01:13:58,650
How dare you attack me?

1067
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,528
Go.
- Market, go.

1068
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,283
Are you seeing how
many persons are there?

1069
01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:05,537
All of them will die
if you start fighting.

1070
01:14:05,617 --> 01:14:07,065
Your lives are in danger.
- Hey Das!

1071
01:14:07,145 --> 01:14:09,810
Oh, God! I got scared!

1072
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:11,405
Did you think I will
be scared if you come

1073
01:14:11,485 --> 01:14:13,480
with an ex-minister
and suspended policemen?

1074
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,209
Market!
- Come.

1075
01:14:15,386 --> 01:14:16,827
You will dead today.
- Market!

1076
01:14:16,907 --> 01:14:17,734
What are you staring at?

1077
01:14:17,814 --> 01:14:18,746
Do you consider
yourself a rich person

1078
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:19,898
if you stand under a umbrella?

1079
01:14:20,283 --> 01:14:22,754
Wait and see. - We should not
fight with other boys.

1080
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:24,480
My mother will beat me.

1081
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,720
Will any mother give
money to her son to fight?

1082
01:14:27,541 --> 01:14:29,355
You beat your mother.

1083
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:31,711
Do not play tricks now. Get down.

1084
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:34,750
All of you will be killed.
Let us see who wins.

1085
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:37,806
Do you think we will
be scared if you come

1086
01:14:37,886 --> 01:14:38,929
in a big car with that useless man?
- They will be holding knives.

1087
01:14:39,009 --> 01:14:40,055
I will not go.

1088
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:41,886
What? Scared of knives?

1089
01:14:41,966 --> 01:14:44,402
But you have gun. Take it out.

1090
01:14:44,482 --> 01:14:46,892
Market will come now and
there is going to blood everywhere.

1091
01:14:46,972 --> 01:14:48,211
All of you will be killed.
- Brother!

1092
01:14:50,035 --> 01:14:51,123
I told you to take out the gun.

1093
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:52,108
Why are you taking
out the mouth organ?

1094
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:54,327
What happened to you?
- Will you kill me? Kill.

1095
01:14:54,543 --> 01:14:55,345
If they decide to kill you

1096
01:14:55,425 --> 01:14:56,453
they will stab any part of body.
Not only chest.

1097
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:59,647
He is showing off his chest size
without knowing the actual position!

1098
01:14:59,727 --> 01:15:01,785
Ask Market to come.

1099
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:03,043
Market! What is this, Market?

1100
01:15:03,338 --> 01:15:04,663
Get down. Go and do something.

1101
01:15:04,743 --> 01:15:07,003
Send him. - They will kill him
if you do not go.

1102
01:15:09,175 --> 01:15:12,099
Market will ask for Steffani.

1103
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:13,741
What will you do then?
Think about it.

1104
01:15:13,821 --> 01:15:15,300
Kill and throw him in drain.
- Do not believe these two people.

1105
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,474
Let us go back.
- Come out.

1106
01:15:16,991 --> 01:15:19,610
What is happening? I am scared.

1107
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,284
Das, come here.

1108
01:15:21,364 --> 01:15:23,088
Send Market.

1109
01:15:23,168 --> 01:15:24,885
Sir, think about it.

1110
01:15:24,965 --> 01:15:27,146
Market may get down any time.
Take care of Steffani Madam.

1111
01:15:27,388 --> 01:15:29,246
Das, spare some time. Come here.

1112
01:15:29,326 --> 01:15:31,657
Leave him and come here.

1113
01:15:34,252 --> 01:15:35,933
Okay. Nobody should move.

1114
01:15:36,013 --> 01:15:37,910
I will be back in two minutes.
- Come now.

1115
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:38,932
We will decide today.

1116
01:15:42,326 --> 01:15:44,373
What is Market saying?
- Some problem.

1117
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:48,584
See there. - Uncle, I feel scared
when I see them.

1118
01:15:48,982 --> 01:15:51,464
Uncle!
- He called me 'brother'.

1119
01:15:51,544 --> 01:15:53,620
He is blabbering.

1120
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,011
Come out.

1121
01:15:56,030 --> 01:16:00,789
Say that he is suffering from fever.
Take some time and come back.

1122
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:02,806
I have already told them.

1123
01:16:02,886 --> 01:16:05,535
We should never be over confidant.

1124
01:16:05,615 --> 01:16:07,548
Manage somehow and try to escape.

1125
01:16:08,869 --> 01:16:10,456
Who is calling now?

1126
01:16:10,536 --> 01:16:11,969
'Sir, do you want to take
life insurance policy?'

1127
01:16:12,049 --> 01:16:13,098
'We have many offers.'

1128
01:16:13,178 --> 01:16:16,443
We are going to die in 5 minutes.
Will you give insurance policy?

1129
01:16:16,523 --> 01:16:17,693
Hang up! Hang up.

1130
01:16:20,308 --> 01:16:23,969
Market says that since
you have bothered to come

1131
01:16:24,049 --> 01:16:26,747
you can handover any one of them.

1132
01:16:27,387 --> 01:16:28,197
What do you mean?

1133
01:16:28,706 --> 01:16:32,618
Sulai or Guna. Handover any one.
We will kill him and go.

1134
01:16:32,698 --> 01:16:34,100
Because he doesn't
want to kill both.

1135
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,819
Think and say.

1136
01:16:35,899 --> 01:16:36,781
We will go home.

1137
01:16:36,861 --> 01:16:39,391
What nonsense are you saying?
- Don't worry. We will wait.

1138
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:42,550
Think and tell.

1139
01:16:49,231 --> 01:16:50,444
What happened?

1140
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:55,783
I have put him in a fix.

1141
01:16:55,863 --> 01:16:57,024
We can manage for now.
- Okay.

1142
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:59,322
Guna, you are the
right person. You go.

1143
01:16:59,402 --> 01:17:00,921
Fool, you are also one of the two.

1144
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:02,754
You also go.

1145
01:17:02,834 --> 01:17:05,062
Sacrifice your life. You go.

1146
01:17:05,142 --> 01:17:06,024
No. You go.

1147
01:17:06,104 --> 01:17:09,969
You go.
- No. I will not go.

1148
01:17:10,049 --> 01:17:12,024
Who is there to serve
our leader if I go?

1149
01:17:12,104 --> 01:17:13,685
Sir, I bow to you. Tell him to go.

1150
01:17:13,765 --> 01:17:16,156
You go. You go.

1151
01:17:17,169 --> 01:17:19,967
I am there to serve Boss.
- You go.

1152
01:17:20,047 --> 01:17:23,008
Hello, have you
decided who will die?

1153
01:17:24,052 --> 01:17:28,139
We can decide later. Tell him to go.

1154
01:17:28,825 --> 01:17:32,155
If you want, Market will get down.
- Not now.

1155
01:17:32,463 --> 01:17:35,893
No problem.
He will get down even now. - Go.

1156
01:17:35,973 --> 01:17:37,299
Stop the car.

1157
01:17:37,379 --> 01:17:39,179
Turn.

1158
01:17:39,259 --> 01:17:41,333
Do not underestimate us.

1159
01:17:42,245 --> 01:17:44,371
They may turn and follow us.
Press the accelerator.

1160
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,780
We have escaped death.

1161
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:48,107
Please do something fast.

1162
01:17:50,602 --> 01:17:52,192
Temperature is abnormal.

1163
01:17:54,108 --> 01:17:55,341
It is fluctuating.

1164
01:17:57,198 --> 01:17:59,270
Palpitation is more.

1165
01:18:00,106 --> 01:18:02,187
I have never seen like this before.
- Even we have not seen.

1166
01:18:04,925 --> 01:18:06,739
I will prescribe a medicine.

1167
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:09,463
Buy it from counter.

1168
01:18:09,543 --> 01:18:10,792
Okay, doctor.

1169
01:18:10,872 --> 01:18:13,546
You will not understand it.
Give it. I will bring.

1170
01:18:13,626 --> 01:18:15,360
Only the people in medical
shop can decipher his handwriting!

1171
01:18:15,882 --> 01:18:18,057
Doctor, you have prescribed
me Paracetamol tablets.

1172
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:20,009
Please suggest me an injection

1173
01:18:20,089 --> 01:18:22,325
of Acetaminophen which
is also a Paracetamol.

1174
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:24,742
Speaking in English!

1175
01:18:25,106 --> 01:18:27,311
Since it is intravenous,
it will be much faster.

1176
01:18:27,706 --> 01:18:30,171
Something like... Yes. This will do.

1177
01:18:44,781 --> 01:18:47,452
He used to talk a lot.
Now he is playing a violin!

1178
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,833
It is mouth organ.
- I don't care.

1179
01:18:50,094 --> 01:18:51,984
He is definitely not Marketraja.

1180
01:18:52,064 --> 01:18:55,017
A dead person is sitting inside him
and playing mouth organ. - What?

1181
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:57,696
He has been possessed by a spirit.

1182
01:18:57,776 --> 01:18:59,872
Otherwise why will he address
as 'uncle' or 'brother'?

1183
01:19:01,934 --> 01:19:04,458
You found him in graveyard. Right?
- Yes.

1184
01:19:04,538 --> 01:19:06,087
A spirit has possessed him there.

1185
01:19:06,167 --> 01:19:07,647
Spirit!

1186
01:19:11,551 --> 01:19:12,674
Oh, God!

1187
01:19:13,471 --> 01:19:14,732
I normally sleep here.

1188
01:19:15,019 --> 01:19:16,146
How do I sleep?

1189
01:19:16,573 --> 01:19:17,427
Where will be head?

1190
01:19:17,507 --> 01:19:18,653
Your head will be here.

1191
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:21,522
Then my chest is there...
- Shut up.

1192
01:19:30,128 --> 01:19:32,574
Oh, God!
- What is it?

1193
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,297
I saw Market.

1194
01:19:36,123 --> 01:19:37,585
Have you never seen him before?

1195
01:19:37,665 --> 01:19:40,053
But I have never seen him like this.

1196
01:19:40,133 --> 01:19:41,854
She looks happy.

1197
01:19:42,885 --> 01:19:44,901
What is this?
- Anjalai has seen.

1198
01:19:45,309 --> 01:19:47,577
Uncle, this is not mine.

1199
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:48,812
It is very big.

1200
01:19:48,892 --> 01:19:50,793
Is that why you
removed your underwear?

1201
01:19:51,946 --> 01:19:53,692
Yes.
- You...

1202
01:19:53,936 --> 01:19:55,707
Wear it.
- He is grown up but no brains.

1203
01:19:55,787 --> 01:19:56,884
Wear it.

1204
01:19:56,964 --> 01:19:59,243
He is not ashamed at all.
Shameless fellow.

1205
01:20:00,201 --> 01:20:03,091
If they know that Market
has become a coward

1206
01:20:03,368 --> 01:20:06,045
they will kill all of us.

1207
01:20:06,596 --> 01:20:08,623
Even our boys should not come up.

1208
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:11,967
Only you,
I and Market should be here.

1209
01:20:12,578 --> 01:20:15,611
Anjalai can give him
food with her eyes closed.

1210
01:20:18,911 --> 01:20:19,840
Yes, madam.

1211
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,965
Go to market and get me some things.
- Okay, madam.

1212
01:20:24,342 --> 01:20:26,749
While returning, go to super market.

1213
01:20:26,829 --> 01:20:28,259
In that market...

1214
01:20:28,339 --> 01:20:29,459
No...

1215
01:20:30,517 --> 01:20:31,655
Go to hyper market.

1216
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:36,048
Why the hell are you
talking about 'market' always?

1217
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,103
Your market is down now.

1218
01:20:38,183 --> 01:20:40,148
Do you know who is
responsible for that?

1219
01:20:40,918 --> 01:20:43,553
I am going to kill Market.

1220
01:20:43,633 --> 01:20:44,833
Your hands will pain!

1221
01:20:54,168 --> 01:20:58,875
"He can fight anyone
who attacks him."

1222
01:20:58,955 --> 01:21:01,601
"He is the King of the entire area."

1223
01:21:01,681 --> 01:21:03,145
"Do not dare to fight him!"

1224
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:06,410
"He can fight any number
of people singlehandedly."

1225
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:09,205
"Was he attacked in the mortuary?"

1226
01:21:09,285 --> 01:21:11,938
"He is a notorious fighter."

1227
01:21:12,018 --> 01:21:14,616
"Marketraja is capable
of fighting anybody."

1228
01:21:14,696 --> 01:21:17,279
"He is a rowdy."

1229
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:19,199
"Is a good fighter."

1230
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:21,562
"Do not try to cheat him."

1231
01:21:21,642 --> 01:21:26,136
"He will kill you."

1232
01:21:26,216 --> 01:21:28,854
"Do you still have any doubt?"

1233
01:21:28,934 --> 01:21:31,878
"He became a don because
of his fighting ability."

1234
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:34,795
Hey! Deliver water can and go away.

1235
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:39,128
Do not stand here. Come on. Get out.

1236
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,256
Do not scratch the sofa.

1237
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:01,366
Everyone was scared of Market.

1238
01:22:01,446 --> 01:22:03,726
But now he has been possessed
by spirit and become a coward.

1239
01:22:03,806 --> 01:22:05,807
You don't worry.
There is a person who can cure him.

1240
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:09,471
There is an exorcist
named Kalavathi who can do it.

1241
01:22:10,537 --> 01:22:12,978
She is best of all.

1242
01:22:14,543 --> 01:22:18,300
Congratulations, Kalavathi!
Congratulations.

1243
01:22:18,826 --> 01:22:21,765
Wish you a happy married life.

1244
01:22:22,554 --> 01:22:24,028
Call Gunaseelan.

1245
01:22:24,517 --> 01:22:25,945
Come.

1246
01:22:28,496 --> 01:22:30,970
Wish you a happy married life.

1247
01:22:40,777 --> 01:22:43,247
It was like a scene from
Gautam Menon's movie! - Yes.

1248
01:22:45,653 --> 01:22:47,369
Ms Kalavathi

1249
01:22:47,449 --> 01:22:50,671
your cheeks were like
apple when we started loving.

1250
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:53,439
Has it turned pale now?

1251
01:22:53,519 --> 01:22:57,917
It is like an orange!
- Oh dear! I feel shy.

1252
01:22:58,298 --> 01:23:02,996
Now I am going to kiss your cheeks.

1253
01:23:03,076 --> 01:23:05,648
That is why we are going
to a resort. - Oh, God!

1254
01:23:05,728 --> 01:23:09,802
Dear, we have a private swimming
pool in that resort in ECR.

1255
01:23:09,882 --> 01:23:12,100
Really? But I do not know swimming.

1256
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:13,642
I will teach you.
- Okay.

1257
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:16,653
Do you know how you
will look in swimsuit?

1258
01:23:16,733 --> 01:23:17,974
Talk softly.

1259
01:23:18,054 --> 01:23:20,074
Driver and cleaner can hear us.

1260
01:23:20,154 --> 01:23:21,513
They will feel jealous.

1261
01:23:23,532 --> 01:23:25,990
They are still young!
- You are driver and I am cleaner.

1262
01:23:26,366 --> 01:23:28,075
Driving so fast!

1263
01:23:28,155 --> 01:23:30,019
Sir, we have reached the resort.

1264
01:23:31,869 --> 01:23:33,042
Alright.

1265
01:23:33,122 --> 01:23:34,866
Come baby.
- Come dear.

1266
01:23:35,069 --> 01:23:37,463
Bring the luggage.
- Okay, sir.

1267
01:23:37,796 --> 01:23:38,905
Come on baby.

1268
01:23:40,704 --> 01:23:43,034
Dear, what is this?

1269
01:23:43,114 --> 01:23:44,476
This is spa.

1270
01:23:44,556 --> 01:23:47,951
They make us lie down give steam.
- But spa looks small.

1271
01:23:48,193 --> 01:23:49,514
They have made it small

1272
01:23:49,594 --> 01:23:52,036
so that we couples can lie close.
- Naughty boy!

1273
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,538
Mother Sundaribai.

1274
01:23:54,618 --> 01:23:56,770
Mother means 'Thai'.
Must be Thai massage.

1275
01:23:56,850 --> 01:23:59,563
Oh! I love Thai massage.
- Yes.

1276
01:23:59,877 --> 01:24:02,436
Come dear.
This place is so romantic.

1277
01:24:02,516 --> 01:24:03,902
Doesn't look like a reception!

1278
01:24:04,433 --> 01:24:05,925
We are Mr and Mrs Gunaseelan.

1279
01:24:06,005 --> 01:24:07,660
Give room key. Give.

1280
01:24:08,086 --> 01:24:09,893
Oh, God!

1281
01:24:10,127 --> 01:24:12,770
Heard that Marketraja is a devil.

1282
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:14,722
Has another spirit possessed him?

1283
01:24:15,145 --> 01:24:18,634
Why have you come
to us at this time?

1284
01:24:18,918 --> 01:24:20,887
Yes. Look...
- Hey!

1285
01:24:21,837 --> 01:24:25,067
Sir, we are '96 batch.

1286
01:24:25,147 --> 01:24:27,604
We were in love since
then and married only now.

1287
01:24:27,684 --> 01:24:29,396
Isn't it?
- '96 batch? Which school?

1288
01:24:29,762 --> 01:24:31,915
Not school. We completed MA in '96.

1289
01:24:31,995 --> 01:24:33,400
You are not newly married couple.

1290
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:35,518
You are newly married old couple.
Understand?

1291
01:24:35,598 --> 01:24:38,723
Sir, you will get better
people than me to drive the spirit.

1292
01:24:38,803 --> 01:24:42,729
Moreover latest expensive
equipments are in my house.

1293
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,220
So we will complete
our stay in resort.

1294
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,226
We will stay here
comfortably and then...

1295
01:24:47,306 --> 01:24:48,677
He is possessed by love.

1296
01:24:48,757 --> 01:24:51,103
First I will cure him and
then drive the other spirit.

1297
01:24:51,183 --> 01:24:52,644
Okay?
- Okay, dear.

1298
01:24:52,724 --> 01:24:54,767
Do not waste your
energy in hand shake.

1299
01:24:54,847 --> 01:24:56,719
I am improving my energy.
- Varada!

1300
01:24:56,799 --> 01:24:59,244
Is this your equipment?

1301
01:24:59,324 --> 01:25:00,721
Oh, God!

1302
01:25:00,801 --> 01:25:02,801
How did you take it from my house?

1303
01:25:02,881 --> 01:25:04,819
We broke the main door
and searched in hall.

1304
01:25:05,265 --> 01:25:06,749
Broke two wooden cupboards...

1305
01:25:06,996 --> 01:25:08,608
Then we broke the cot.
This was in that.

1306
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:10,461
Oh, God! Have you broken the cot?

1307
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:11,506
What is your decision now?

1308
01:25:11,586 --> 01:25:13,699
Okay. We will drive the spirit fast.

1309
01:25:13,779 --> 01:25:14,825
Okay.
- Let us start from here.

1310
01:25:14,905 --> 01:25:15,870
Okay, dear?
- Yes, dear.

1311
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:21,420
The resort, swimming pool,
me and the spa will wait for you.

1312
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,841
Cheers.

1313
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:25,519
Why do you look sullen?

1314
01:25:26,384 --> 01:25:28,984
I am in my 40's.

1315
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:31,134
Loving her since 30 years.

1316
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:33,339
We decided just 3 days back.

1317
01:25:34,034 --> 01:25:35,721
And we got married 3 hours back.

1318
01:25:36,203 --> 01:25:38,343
We were in full mood.
You spoiled it.

1319
01:25:38,423 --> 01:25:42,283
Tell your wife to
drive away the spirit.

1320
01:25:42,363 --> 01:25:45,082
We will send you back
to the resort in 3 hours.

1321
01:25:45,162 --> 01:25:47,010
You can enjoy.
- Spa!

1322
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:48,620
How can she drive away
spirit when it is not there?

1323
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,635
There are no spirits in this world.

1324
01:25:51,206 --> 01:25:52,481
Don't you believe in ghosts?

1325
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,019
None in our family believe.

1326
01:25:54,653 --> 01:25:56,020
Shall I tell 2 stories?

1327
01:25:57,095 --> 01:25:57,926
1st story.

1328
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,256
There is a dilapidated
bungalow in my native.

1329
01:26:02,209 --> 01:26:03,702
Look, he is scared!

1330
01:26:04,127 --> 01:26:05,619
It is a belief that
there is a ghost there

1331
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:08,453
and it will kill the person
who stays there for a night.

1332
01:26:08,533 --> 01:26:10,175
My father went to the
bungalow when I was a child.

1333
01:26:10,255 --> 01:26:11,397
It has been 30 years now.

1334
01:26:11,783 --> 01:26:13,031
He has still not returned.

1335
01:26:13,111 --> 01:26:14,311
Do you know it?

1336
01:26:15,657 --> 01:26:18,881
Is he staying there
for 30x365 nights alone?

1337
01:26:18,961 --> 01:26:20,023
Continue.

1338
01:26:20,103 --> 01:26:21,197
Listen.

1339
01:26:21,277 --> 01:26:23,394
There is a vampire in
a well in our native place.

1340
01:26:23,474 --> 01:26:24,284
People say the vampire
will pull that person's leg

1341
01:26:24,364 --> 01:26:25,755
who goes there to
take bath and kill him.

1342
01:26:25,835 --> 01:26:28,539
But my brother dived into the well.

1343
01:26:28,836 --> 01:26:31,302
It has been 15 years
and he has still not come.

1344
01:26:31,899 --> 01:26:33,603
15x365 days...

1345
01:26:34,407 --> 01:26:35,298
He has been in water.
- Yes.

1346
01:26:35,378 --> 01:26:37,135
With courage.
- Yes. He dived into it.

1347
01:26:37,561 --> 01:26:39,447
You are shocked. Isn't it?
- Yes.

1348
01:26:40,331 --> 01:26:42,145
How will he believe in ghosts?

1349
01:26:42,602 --> 01:26:43,852
Who is coming there?
Your wife or ghost?

1350
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:45,353
"Ghostbusters!"

1351
01:26:46,212 --> 01:26:50,390
She looks like the
heroine of a movie. Right?

1352
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:51,900
I think she looks like
a pesticides sprayer.

1353
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:53,396
You are jealous.
- Shut up!

1354
01:26:53,476 --> 01:26:54,830
This is a ghost detector.
- Okay.

1355
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,381
I am a ghost jailor.

1356
01:26:56,682 --> 01:26:58,520
In which room is the ghost there?
- There.

1357
01:26:58,600 --> 01:26:59,853
"Ghostbusters!"

1358
01:26:59,933 --> 01:27:03,409
Dear, God bless you.

1359
01:27:03,489 --> 01:27:05,493
I will come back dear.
- I am waiting.

1360
01:28:56,642 --> 01:28:59,105
Say whether you won or lost.

1361
01:28:59,587 --> 01:29:01,265
Varada! Go and see.

1362
01:29:01,694 --> 01:29:02,646
Wait.

1363
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,501
Market has been possessed

1364
01:29:08,879 --> 01:29:11,527
by the spirit of Chandrababu,
a medical college student.

1365
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:13,471
It communicated with me.

1366
01:29:14,397 --> 01:29:15,403
That night...

1367
01:29:15,658 --> 01:29:19,115
Market was targeted
but a doctor died.

1368
01:29:20,862 --> 01:29:21,713
Yes.

1369
01:29:22,009 --> 01:29:23,841
Has that boy's spirit
entered Market's body?

1370
01:29:23,921 --> 01:29:26,915
The subconscious mind
of Chandrababu spoke to me.

1371
01:29:27,483 --> 01:29:29,385
It has put Market's soul to sleep

1372
01:29:29,729 --> 01:29:33,518
and this boy's soul
is awake inside him.

1373
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:35,245
Is this Sandwitch made with souls?

1374
01:29:35,325 --> 01:29:36,763
Keep quiet, dear.

1375
01:29:37,117 --> 01:29:38,060
Sorry dear.

1376
01:29:38,716 --> 01:29:43,547
The irony is that the boy
doesn't know that he is dead. - So?

1377
01:29:43,627 --> 01:29:48,461
Ferocious souls try to
come out of the body with force.

1378
01:29:48,996 --> 01:29:50,895
But this boy is a coward.

1379
01:29:50,975 --> 01:29:52,698
So he has stuck to Market.

1380
01:29:52,778 --> 01:29:54,433
You are an expert exorcist.

1381
01:29:54,513 --> 01:29:55,369
Drive away the spirit.

1382
01:29:55,449 --> 01:29:56,779
Is it a bike that she can drive it?

1383
01:29:56,859 --> 01:29:58,012
Dear!
- Sorry.

1384
01:29:59,167 --> 01:30:03,225
Mr Das, I will chat in Skype
with our Ghostbusters club members

1385
01:30:03,305 --> 01:30:05,256
and find out a remedy for this.

1386
01:30:07,127 --> 01:30:09,263
It may take a month for that,
isn't it dear? - Maybe.

1387
01:30:09,343 --> 01:30:11,889
Sir, we will celebrate
our first night by that time

1388
01:30:11,969 --> 01:30:13,443
and return with a good idea.

1389
01:30:13,523 --> 01:30:15,166
Okay? Let's go.
- Hey!

1390
01:30:16,827 --> 01:30:19,259
if it becomes public that
Marketraja has become a coward

1391
01:30:19,339 --> 01:30:21,180
we will be killed.

1392
01:30:21,672 --> 01:30:23,359
What can we do about it?

1393
01:30:23,439 --> 01:30:26,157
Drive away that spirit

1394
01:30:26,237 --> 01:30:28,504
handover Market to us and then go.

1395
01:30:28,584 --> 01:30:31,338
Till then you will be our guests.

1396
01:30:31,418 --> 01:30:34,254
Varada, take them
to the 1st night coupe.

1397
01:30:34,334 --> 01:30:35,427
Go.
- Hey!

1398
01:30:36,237 --> 01:30:37,437
Have you seen Karate?

1399
01:30:37,517 --> 01:30:40,319
What did you say?
- I have watched in TV.

1400
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:44,406
Go. You will have to stay here.

1401
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:27,236
Vani, what are you doing?

1402
01:31:38,635 --> 01:31:39,520
Did you see Market?

1403
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,269
Saw him walking fast in anger.

1404
01:31:42,349 --> 01:31:44,789
I thought someone is going to
be killed. Didn't you go with him?

1405
01:31:48,489 --> 01:31:50,188
Varada! Varada, Market has escaped.

1406
01:31:50,268 --> 01:31:51,428
We have lost him.
- Oh, God!

1407
01:31:51,508 --> 01:31:53,116
Let us send our men to the
usual places where Market goes.

1408
01:31:53,196 --> 01:31:53,999
Okay.
- Yes.

1409
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:56,607
Hello, instead of
searching for Market

1410
01:31:56,687 --> 01:31:59,163
search the places where
Chandrababu frequents.

1411
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:01,547
Then?

1412
01:32:01,627 --> 01:32:02,688
Medical college.

1413
01:32:12,812 --> 01:32:14,654
You will be hit if you do like this.

1414
01:32:14,734 --> 01:32:16,886
Understand?

1415
01:32:22,217 --> 01:32:23,399
Hello!

1416
01:32:24,294 --> 01:32:27,983
We are just kidding.
- You are hurting me.

1417
01:32:28,063 --> 01:32:29,725
Please do not tell
him after he recovers.

1418
01:32:29,805 --> 01:32:31,389
He is beating me.

1419
01:32:32,226 --> 01:32:33,957
See what he is doing?
- I was angry and so hit him.

1420
01:32:34,037 --> 01:32:36,800
He is beating me because
I went to college.

1421
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:43,320
Market has thrashed me
before for letting go two cases.

1422
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,534
Then?
- Let me also beat him now.

1423
01:32:46,774 --> 01:32:50,357
Will hit you.
- Oh, God! You are hurting me.

1424
01:32:50,437 --> 01:32:52,659
Will hit you.
- Oh, God!

1425
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:54,011
Why so much noise?

1426
01:32:54,091 --> 01:32:56,412
Market has been awarded
Arakkonam railway contract.

1427
01:32:56,492 --> 01:32:57,799
That is why we are going around.

1428
01:32:57,879 --> 01:32:59,740
That's good.

1429
01:33:00,388 --> 01:33:03,218
Feel like puking. Some bad smell.

1430
01:33:03,473 --> 01:33:04,576
From where is it coming?

1431
01:33:05,139 --> 01:33:06,281
Look at that haughty lady.

1432
01:33:06,361 --> 01:33:08,314
Bullet lady!

1433
01:33:08,567 --> 01:33:09,638
See this side.

1434
01:33:09,718 --> 01:33:10,949
You should not smoke here.

1435
01:33:11,029 --> 01:33:12,119
You are arrogant.

1436
01:33:12,926 --> 01:33:14,694
Do you think you are a famous hero?

1437
01:33:15,568 --> 01:33:16,734
One more person wearing a Lungi!

1438
01:33:16,814 --> 01:33:18,850
You should not wear
Lungi for college.

1439
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:20,909
Oh! He is removing it.

1440
01:33:20,989 --> 01:33:22,026
He is taking it out.
He has removed out.

1441
01:33:22,106 --> 01:33:23,839
How dare you talk to Madam
like that? - Why should I care?

1442
01:33:23,919 --> 01:33:26,199
The whole area of
Perambur is scared of her.

1443
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:28,242
Is it? Do not lie.

1444
01:33:28,322 --> 01:33:30,187
He knows your real status.
- Hey!

1445
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:32,497
Who are you? What is your address?

1446
01:33:32,577 --> 01:33:33,715
Nagesh Babu, 2nd street.

1447
01:33:33,795 --> 01:33:36,215
I asked for address but
he is replying like a song.

1448
01:33:36,295 --> 01:33:37,143
Song!

1449
01:33:37,476 --> 01:33:40,598
When I said Margabandu 2nd street,
you said it is like poetry!

1450
01:33:41,544 --> 01:33:42,864
Hey!
- Yes.

1451
01:33:42,944 --> 01:33:44,777
That doctor girl is coming.
Go and meet her.

1452
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:46,507
Hey doctor! Wait.

1453
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:48,197
Stop...

1454
01:33:48,796 --> 01:33:50,064
Hey! Turn right.

1455
01:33:50,144 --> 01:33:52,428
Sister wants to meet you.

1456
01:33:52,508 --> 01:33:55,365
She has come.
- Hey doctor girl!

1457
01:33:55,445 --> 01:33:58,034
You dare to challenge me.

1458
01:33:58,114 --> 01:34:00,444
You must be very daring.

1459
01:34:00,524 --> 01:34:06,565
You took Sundaribai on the other day
to convey your love to Marketraja.

1460
01:34:06,645 --> 01:34:07,685
Yes.

1461
01:34:07,765 --> 01:34:10,094
But how did you
make him love you now?

1462
01:34:10,174 --> 01:34:14,336
I will take you to
Marketraja's house tomorrow

1463
01:34:14,416 --> 01:34:17,267
and put bangles for him.
Wait and see.

1464
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:19,538
Bangles for him?

1465
01:34:20,618 --> 01:34:22,102
What will my son think?

1466
01:34:22,733 --> 01:34:25,893
Won't he mistake me for pledging
him for the sake of 12 bangles?

1467
01:34:25,973 --> 01:34:28,185
I will not come there.
Will not come.

1468
01:34:28,592 --> 01:34:30,083
No. You will get bangles
only if you come.

1469
01:34:30,163 --> 01:34:31,985
Sister, you should not go there.

1470
01:34:32,315 --> 01:34:33,912
Let us solve it here.

1471
01:34:33,992 --> 01:34:38,537
Do not leave this place without
bangles or the equivalent money.

1472
01:34:38,842 --> 01:34:39,876
Is it?

1473
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:42,993
Then I will make
Marketraja come here.

1474
01:34:43,073 --> 01:34:44,839
And I will put bangles for him here.

1475
01:34:44,919 --> 01:34:46,127
Do it.

1476
01:34:46,207 --> 01:34:48,930
He will come and hit you.
Then you will run away.

1477
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:51,003
I do not want bangles.

1478
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:53,810
A mother is acting like a pimp here.

1479
01:34:54,785 --> 01:34:56,224
I am dean's daughter.

1480
01:34:56,614 --> 01:34:59,364
The entire college will
surround you on my orders.

1481
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:02,119
Either you come
to Marketraja's house

1482
01:35:02,199 --> 01:35:05,122
or I will make Marketraja come here.

1483
01:35:05,202 --> 01:35:09,033
What do you say?
- Let him not come here.

1484
01:35:09,113 --> 01:35:14,526
I will go to my son's
house and take it.

1485
01:35:15,236 --> 01:35:17,309
Okay. You can go to study.

1486
01:35:20,453 --> 01:35:22,499
She has cornered me.

1487
01:35:22,897 --> 01:35:26,944
I have driven away many
violent and fearful ghosts.

1488
01:35:27,024 --> 01:35:30,008
But this coward spirit
is posing a challenge for me.

1489
01:35:30,088 --> 01:35:33,234
How can she drive away
a spirit which is not there?

1490
01:35:33,314 --> 01:35:35,004
I will prove it now.

1491
01:35:37,126 --> 01:35:38,693
Are you cheating others
by showing this as a machine

1492
01:35:38,773 --> 01:35:39,879
which drives away spirits?

1493
01:35:39,959 --> 01:35:42,315
4 million Youtube views for this!

1494
01:35:42,395 --> 01:35:44,267
Where is it?

1495
01:35:44,962 --> 01:35:47,309
You will take this skull.

1496
01:35:47,933 --> 01:35:50,207
Be careful. - Then you will hit
the head with this weapon.

1497
01:35:50,287 --> 01:35:51,892
After that you will murmur
something and keep it on ground.

1498
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:55,123
Then you will switch on this light.
- You will look at this.

1499
01:35:55,203 --> 01:35:58,558
Then you will hold it
like a pesticide sprayer.

1500
01:35:58,638 --> 01:35:59,874
Show it here.

1501
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:01,537
Then show it there.

1502
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:03,671
Then you will see whether
the ghost is here.

1503
01:36:03,751 --> 01:36:05,085
Then...
- Have you done it?

1504
01:36:05,165 --> 01:36:07,367
Okay. Continue.
- Yes.

1505
01:36:08,472 --> 01:36:09,477
Look at this doll.

1506
01:36:09,557 --> 01:36:11,115
It is like famous
singer Michael Jackson.

1507
01:36:11,388 --> 01:36:13,539
Then you will hit
both the dolls like this.

1508
01:36:13,619 --> 01:36:15,531
Will the ghost couples
come as soon as you do it?

1509
01:36:15,611 --> 01:36:17,170
Do not cook up stories.

1510
01:36:17,675 --> 01:36:19,141
Is this the ghosts' Wifi?

1511
01:36:19,221 --> 01:36:20,685
Will a person

1512
01:36:20,765 --> 01:36:24,691
who died in railway track come
back as ghost if I hold like this?

1513
01:36:24,771 --> 01:36:26,776
Tell me. Is it 4G or 5G?

1514
01:36:27,915 --> 01:36:30,125
Can we see ghosts with this?

1515
01:36:30,205 --> 01:36:33,012
You can see the ghosts
as well as hear them speak.

1516
01:36:33,092 --> 01:36:36,774
Wear it.
- Let me check whether I can see.

1517
01:36:39,305 --> 01:36:40,138
Where?

1518
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:43,595
Oh, God!
I can really see the ghosts.

1519
01:36:43,675 --> 01:36:46,244
I think I will die.

1520
01:36:47,275 --> 01:36:49,471
Kala, please drive away the ghosts.

1521
01:36:49,551 --> 01:36:50,572
Please...

1522
01:36:50,652 --> 01:36:53,300
I have not bought
the equipments for that.

1523
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:54,899
I cannot drive away
the ghosts which have come.

1524
01:36:54,979 --> 01:36:56,253
Adjust.

1525
01:36:57,194 --> 01:36:58,763
Ticket...

1526
01:36:58,843 --> 01:37:01,073
They are actually dead people.

1527
01:37:01,153 --> 01:37:02,622
Where is your ticket?
- My ticket?

1528
01:37:02,702 --> 01:37:04,539
Yes. Show it.
- Move.

1529
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:06,862
Buy fruit for me.
- Please buy ticket for me.

1530
01:37:06,942 --> 01:37:08,462
Tell your name.
What is your seat number?

1531
01:37:08,702 --> 01:37:09,547
Show ID.

1532
01:37:09,627 --> 01:37:10,849
They are yet to get it.

1533
01:37:12,372 --> 01:37:13,183
Kalavathi!

1534
01:37:14,249 --> 01:37:16,816
Hey! Do not look up.
Bend down and walk.

1535
01:37:16,896 --> 01:37:19,142
Why is he walking like this?

1536
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,226
Do you think they
can drive away the ghost?

1537
01:37:21,576 --> 01:37:22,941
They cannot do it.

1538
01:37:23,021 --> 01:37:25,104
No use. We can send
them for their honeymoon.

1539
01:37:26,214 --> 01:37:27,245
Das!

1540
01:37:27,325 --> 01:37:28,649
What?
- Sundaribai is coming.

1541
01:37:28,729 --> 01:37:29,624
Oh, God!

1542
01:37:29,704 --> 01:37:32,371
All of you show respect to me.

1543
01:37:32,451 --> 01:37:36,055
Wait. You be here. I will go in.

1544
01:37:36,135 --> 01:37:39,275
Why? I will also come.
- No. You should not come.

1545
01:37:39,355 --> 01:37:41,099
I will slap and scold my son.

1546
01:37:41,179 --> 01:37:43,615
You should not see it.

1547
01:37:43,695 --> 01:37:45,177
Will you slap him?
- Yes.

1548
01:37:45,257 --> 01:37:47,844
He told me to wait a few days

1549
01:37:47,924 --> 01:37:50,265
but started roaming with
you without informing you.

1550
01:37:50,345 --> 01:37:52,718
I will scold him.

1551
01:37:52,798 --> 01:37:55,503
But nobody should see it.

1552
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:56,601
You stay back.

1553
01:37:57,850 --> 01:37:59,625
You come.
- Wait.

1554
01:37:59,705 --> 01:38:02,004
Your mother is coming to meet you.

1555
01:38:02,084 --> 01:38:05,193
As soon as she comes,
give her a tight slap.

1556
01:38:05,273 --> 01:38:06,699
Okay?
- It should be painful for her.

1557
01:38:06,779 --> 01:38:08,329
Okay?
- Poor lady.

1558
01:38:08,409 --> 01:38:09,511
No. I do not slap anyone.

1559
01:38:09,819 --> 01:38:10,838
He talks as if he is
a very good person! - Hey!

1560
01:38:11,031 --> 01:38:12,398
Do as I say. Right?

1561
01:38:12,877 --> 01:38:14,384
Go...

1562
01:38:17,852 --> 01:38:21,732
I feel scared to see him.

1563
01:38:29,412 --> 01:38:30,537
SIster!
- Oh, God!

1564
01:38:30,617 --> 01:38:32,321
SIster, go.
- Go, sister.

1565
01:38:32,401 --> 01:38:33,477
Go.
- Go, sister.

1566
01:38:33,557 --> 01:38:34,712
Don't stop.
- Go, sister.

1567
01:38:34,792 --> 01:38:35,801
Go.
- Go, sister.

1568
01:38:35,881 --> 01:38:36,689
Go.

1569
01:38:36,769 --> 01:38:38,539
Sister!
- Oh, God! No.

1570
01:38:38,619 --> 01:38:41,371
Mother!

1571
01:38:42,148 --> 01:38:43,838
Where are you going?

1572
01:38:45,099 --> 01:38:46,300
Come here.

1573
01:38:47,752 --> 01:38:48,667
Go.

1574
01:38:54,879 --> 01:38:56,682
The two persons who
are with her are dangerous.

1575
01:38:56,762 --> 01:38:58,174
They will tell everyone about him.

1576
01:38:58,254 --> 01:39:01,637
Raja! Are you my son?

1577
01:39:01,984 --> 01:39:03,450
No, mother.

1578
01:39:03,764 --> 01:39:05,796
I know it.

1579
01:39:05,876 --> 01:39:07,324
Doesn't a mother know her son?

1580
01:39:07,404 --> 01:39:10,968
Hey Das! Do you think
I do not know anything?

1581
01:39:11,048 --> 01:39:13,292
Don't I know?
- Yes, sister.

1582
01:39:13,372 --> 01:39:16,652
I know what has
entered my son's body?

1583
01:39:16,732 --> 01:39:19,956
Sister, how do you know?
- Do not act in haste.

1584
01:39:21,695 --> 01:39:24,334
Love has occupied his heart.

1585
01:39:25,598 --> 01:39:27,875
Are you hiding it from me?

1586
01:39:27,955 --> 01:39:30,540
Even a tiger becomes
timid if it is in love.

1587
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:33,147
Super! You are capable
of joining CBI.

1588
01:39:33,227 --> 01:39:34,839
Hey doctor girl!

1589
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:39,080
Hi!

1590
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,690
Doctor girl!
- What?

1591
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:42,628
You said you will give me bangles.

1592
01:39:42,708 --> 01:39:44,665
Come...

1593
01:39:45,215 --> 01:39:46,756
Come.
- Why should I come?

1594
01:39:46,982 --> 01:39:47,832
Come.

1595
01:39:49,661 --> 01:39:50,526
Put it for her.

1596
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:10,473
Hey, come and see this.

1597
01:40:15,172 --> 01:40:16,164
What is happening here?

1598
01:40:16,244 --> 01:40:17,932
Baby shower for Sundaribai!

1599
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:18,988
Nonsense.

1600
01:40:22,031 --> 01:40:24,018
Sundaribai has become emotional.

1601
01:40:25,416 --> 01:40:27,180
See this.

1602
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:29,073
Bless me.

1603
01:40:29,153 --> 01:40:31,526
O My God!

1604
01:40:31,606 --> 01:40:32,790
Doctor girl!

1605
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:36,686
Will you save me if I something
happens to be out of joy?

1606
01:40:36,766 --> 01:40:39,228
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1607
01:40:40,135 --> 01:40:41,703
Oh, God!

1608
01:40:47,589 --> 01:40:49,714
Hello! Tell me.
- Radha sir is coming.

1609
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:51,740
What?
- Radha sir is coming here.

1610
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:52,984
Radha sir is coming here?

1611
01:40:53,064 --> 01:40:55,123
We are finished. Godfather?

1612
01:40:55,396 --> 01:40:56,573
Oh, God!

1613
01:40:56,653 --> 01:40:58,335
What to do now?
- Where is he?

1614
01:40:58,415 --> 01:40:59,444
He is studying.

1615
01:40:59,524 --> 01:41:01,143
Can you perform operation
after reading it?

1616
01:41:01,223 --> 01:41:03,169
Trust me. I am a junior doctor.

1617
01:41:03,249 --> 01:41:05,940
You didn't know English.
- Lift him.

1618
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:07,427
Sit.

1619
01:41:08,009 --> 01:41:08,877
Oh, God!

1620
01:41:14,965 --> 01:41:16,736
Welcome, sir.
- Welcome.

1621
01:41:16,816 --> 01:41:17,832
Greetings.

1622
01:41:23,848 --> 01:41:25,413
I am coming straight
from the airport.

1623
01:41:25,768 --> 01:41:27,327
Bought duty free liquor.

1624
01:41:27,407 --> 01:41:29,627
Foreign liquor. Enjoy.

1625
01:41:29,707 --> 01:41:30,795
Thank you.

1626
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:32,882
Liquor.

1627
01:41:34,246 --> 01:41:36,325
I want to speak
personally with Market.

1628
01:41:36,405 --> 01:41:37,270
Go.

1629
01:41:38,992 --> 01:41:40,193
You coward!

1630
01:41:40,523 --> 01:41:42,046
Do not speak unnecessarily.

1631
01:41:42,126 --> 01:41:44,101
Keep quiet. Do you understand?

1632
01:41:58,769 --> 01:42:02,368
Hope you were not troubled by police
of minister when I had gone abroad.

1633
01:42:04,954 --> 01:42:08,175
When are you going
to return my things?

1634
01:42:11,234 --> 01:42:12,458
Shall we go now?

1635
01:42:15,682 --> 01:42:16,598
One minute...

1636
01:42:23,004 --> 01:42:24,085
What happened?

1637
01:42:25,668 --> 01:42:26,477
What?

1638
01:42:27,899 --> 01:42:29,715
The new sir...
- Who?

1639
01:42:29,937 --> 01:42:30,985
M.R Radha.

1640
01:42:31,143 --> 01:42:31,964
Okay.

1641
01:42:32,157 --> 01:42:34,159
He wants back the
liquor which he gave.

1642
01:42:34,574 --> 01:42:37,227
We have opened and drunk half of it.

1643
01:42:37,307 --> 01:42:39,059
We have already drunk.
- Tell him.

1644
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:42,121
He is our man.
- Okay.

1645
01:42:42,201 --> 01:42:44,883
Tell him that you
will keep the liquor.

1646
01:42:44,963 --> 01:42:45,835
Alright.

1647
01:42:45,915 --> 01:42:48,891
Hey! Why are you
walking like a coward?

1648
01:42:49,521 --> 01:42:54,320
Walk smartly.
Go, sit cross legged and then say.

1649
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,471
Smartly means?
- It means...

1650
01:42:56,551 --> 01:42:59,016
Hold the shoulder high. Go now.

1651
01:42:59,339 --> 01:43:00,756
How is this?
- Go.

1652
01:43:00,836 --> 01:43:02,072
He is very innocent.

1653
01:43:03,565 --> 01:43:04,902
Go.
- Okay.

1654
01:43:12,073 --> 01:43:13,198
Let the liquor be with me.

1655
01:43:16,603 --> 01:43:19,324
I have been observing that
your behavior is not right.

1656
01:43:19,633 --> 01:43:21,972
Do not play tricks.
I am a wicked person.

1657
01:43:22,562 --> 01:43:23,727
Liquor is mine.

1658
01:43:24,066 --> 01:43:25,665
Return it back.

1659
01:43:27,114 --> 01:43:28,134
Shall we go?

1660
01:43:29,611 --> 01:43:30,708
One minute...

1661
01:43:33,459 --> 01:43:34,636
Why have you come back?

1662
01:43:34,716 --> 01:43:37,983
Uncle says it is his liquor
and wants me to return it.

1663
01:43:38,063 --> 01:43:40,714
Why is he behaving like this?

1664
01:43:41,503 --> 01:43:45,194
He is so cheap that he wants
back the liquor given by him.

1665
01:43:45,274 --> 01:43:47,070
Why are you addressing
him with respect?

1666
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:48,329
Don't do it.

1667
01:43:48,409 --> 01:43:49,502
Do not address him with respect.

1668
01:43:49,582 --> 01:43:51,093
Alright.
- Yes.

1669
01:43:51,523 --> 01:43:53,311
Convey as poetry.

1670
01:43:53,391 --> 01:43:54,542
Okay. Listen now.

1671
01:43:56,897 --> 01:43:59,371
"What belonged to you yesterday..."

1672
01:43:59,451 --> 01:44:00,937
"What belonged to you yesterday..."

1673
01:44:01,017 --> 01:44:02,521
It is mine today.

1674
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:03,715
It is mine.

1675
01:44:03,795 --> 01:44:05,894
"It is mine today."

1676
01:44:05,974 --> 01:44:07,546
"It is mine today."

1677
01:44:07,626 --> 01:44:09,445
Bhagwad Gita preaches this.

1678
01:44:09,525 --> 01:44:11,093
Bhagwad Gita preaches this.

1679
01:44:12,448 --> 01:44:13,765
Go and tell him.
- Okay.

1680
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:18,146
What belonged to you yesterday...
- Hey!

1681
01:44:18,226 --> 01:44:19,525
Come here.
- What uncle?

1682
01:44:19,605 --> 01:44:20,627
Come here.

1683
01:44:20,707 --> 01:44:23,014
Give him this snack
instead of liquor.

1684
01:44:23,094 --> 01:44:24,573
How is it?

1685
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:29,843
What belonged to you yesterday...

1686
01:44:29,923 --> 01:44:31,060
It is mine today.

1687
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:32,472
Bhagwad Gita preaches this.

1688
01:44:34,615 --> 01:44:36,773
I wanted my documents.

1689
01:44:36,853 --> 01:44:39,083
Are you insulting
me by giving this snack?

1690
01:44:39,163 --> 01:44:41,975
How dare you play tricks with me?

1691
01:44:43,016 --> 01:44:44,544
You might have changed.

1692
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:46,941
But I am still the same person.

1693
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:48,968
Government is in my hands.

1694
01:44:49,433 --> 01:44:51,740
I will shoot you.
- Hey!

1695
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:54,063
Sir! Don't do it. Sir!
- Leave me.

1696
01:44:54,143 --> 01:44:56,662
Why are you trying to shoot him
like cinema villain MR Radha?

1697
01:44:56,742 --> 01:44:58,738
Drop the gun.

1698
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:00,867
I may not be the villain.

1699
01:45:00,947 --> 01:45:02,599
But definitely he is not MGR,
the hero.

1700
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:04,126
He is cheating me.

1701
01:45:04,383 --> 01:45:06,951
Like a villain in cinema.

1702
01:45:07,681 --> 01:45:10,134
My liquor. Liquor...

1703
01:45:10,386 --> 01:45:11,364
Liquor...

1704
01:45:11,444 --> 01:45:14,401
I have favored you
by removing your name

1705
01:45:14,481 --> 01:45:16,722
from encounter list many times.
Think about it.

1706
01:45:17,857 --> 01:45:20,115
You should come to
me and return my things.

1707
01:45:23,464 --> 01:45:25,665
What is he talking about?

1708
01:45:25,745 --> 01:45:27,048
I don't know.

1709
01:45:27,128 --> 01:45:28,108
How will he know?

1710
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:31,961
He is actually Chandrababu.

1711
01:45:50,887 --> 01:45:51,777
Hey!

1712
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:54,343
Where are you?

1713
01:46:02,716 --> 01:46:06,112
Drive straight.
We have to go till canteen. Go.

1714
01:46:06,638 --> 01:46:10,517
I can go even till Delhi
if you are sitting in the back.

1715
01:46:10,844 --> 01:46:12,891
Why are you asking me to stop here?

1716
01:46:29,428 --> 01:46:31,252
Wait here.
I will meet mother and come.

1717
01:46:31,332 --> 01:46:32,828
Meet mother!
- Yes, my mother.

1718
01:46:32,908 --> 01:46:33,894
Mother...

1719
01:46:47,377 --> 01:46:48,497
Hi!

1720
01:46:54,129 --> 01:46:55,164
Madam!

1721
01:46:56,625 --> 01:46:57,645
Hey!

1722
01:47:00,876 --> 01:47:02,088
What happened?

1723
01:47:02,168 --> 01:47:04,171
Who are you?

1724
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:05,602
What s this, Mother?

1725
01:47:06,597 --> 01:47:07,511
Mother!

1726
01:47:08,056 --> 01:47:09,403
Hey! Who are you?
- What mother?

1727
01:47:09,483 --> 01:47:11,759
Who allowed you inside?
- Get out.

1728
01:47:11,839 --> 01:47:14,277
Mother. Open the door.
- Get out.

1729
01:47:14,357 --> 01:47:16,005
Mother. Mother.
- Get out.

1730
01:47:16,085 --> 01:47:17,695
Why are you suddenly angry with me?

1731
01:47:17,775 --> 01:47:19,611
He is calling her mother.

1732
01:47:19,691 --> 01:47:21,547
Mother, open the door.
- Get out of here.

1733
01:47:21,627 --> 01:47:24,452
Get out of here.
- Why is mother inside?

1734
01:47:24,532 --> 01:47:26,688
She is not your mother.

1735
01:47:26,768 --> 01:47:27,937
I understood.
- Get out.

1736
01:47:28,017 --> 01:47:31,032
Mother is angry because
I have come with that girl.

1737
01:47:31,112 --> 01:47:33,587
Let me explain. Open the door.
- Get out.

1738
01:47:33,667 --> 01:47:36,459
Mother. - Will you go
or shall I call the police?

1739
01:47:36,539 --> 01:47:39,060
Get out. Who are you?

1740
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:41,425
He is not going out
in spite of telling him.

1741
01:47:41,505 --> 01:47:44,834
What work do you have here?

1742
01:47:44,914 --> 01:47:45,843
Kick him out.

1743
01:48:00,788 --> 01:48:03,963
Come out. Why are you playing music?
- Wait.

1744
01:48:40,075 --> 01:48:41,438
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1745
01:48:41,518 --> 01:48:43,005
I will not play.

1746
01:48:43,345 --> 01:48:46,064
Madam, your son is playing music.

1747
01:49:45,247 --> 01:49:47,213
Give him sweet.

1748
01:50:07,472 --> 01:50:09,183
Please do not cry.

1749
01:50:41,701 --> 01:50:44,718
Latha madam, your son is not dead.

1750
01:50:58,392 --> 01:51:00,066
You don't worry.

1751
01:51:00,146 --> 01:51:01,987
I will convince mother. Okay?

1752
01:51:11,077 --> 01:51:12,029
Market!

1753
01:51:12,109 --> 01:51:13,415
Go away. Go.

1754
01:51:13,495 --> 01:51:15,346
They are crowding around him.
Go away.

1755
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:18,480
You have dressed up as if
you are attending an interview!

1756
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,339
Looks like you know the truth.

1757
01:51:20,419 --> 01:51:21,759
Why have you tucked in the shirt?

1758
01:51:21,839 --> 01:51:23,912
We are scared that our
entire gang will be wiped out.

1759
01:51:23,992 --> 01:51:25,652
Where did you go
without informing us?

1760
01:51:29,376 --> 01:51:31,528
Untidy your hair.
I feel tired when I see you.

1761
01:51:31,608 --> 01:51:33,064
Oh, God! Are you sick?

1762
01:51:34,011 --> 01:51:35,584
Give me stethoscope.
- He will die.

1763
01:51:36,187 --> 01:51:37,321
Let me check your full body. Okay?

1764
01:51:37,401 --> 01:51:39,146
Hey! Market is talking
in a weird way.

1765
01:51:39,226 --> 01:51:40,195
Market is talking in a weird way.

1766
01:51:40,275 --> 01:51:42,161
Come to hospital tomorrow.
We will get you admitted.

1767
01:51:42,241 --> 01:51:43,312
Come.
- Take care of your health.

1768
01:51:43,392 --> 01:51:46,241
Hey! I feel happy that Market
cares for me. - Go inside.

1769
01:51:50,841 --> 01:51:52,049
I knew just now.

1770
01:51:53,466 --> 01:51:54,925
You have a serious problem.

1771
01:51:55,874 --> 01:52:00,655
Both of us want Marketraja.

1772
01:52:03,787 --> 01:52:05,261
Take proper care of him.

1773
01:52:05,623 --> 01:52:06,927
Let me go.

1774
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:13,548
You believed Sundaribai
and are roaming after him.

1775
01:52:14,189 --> 01:52:16,452
Where is he?

1776
01:52:17,646 --> 01:52:19,598
How dare she advise me
to take proper care of him!

1777
01:52:19,678 --> 01:52:20,687
Let me go and see him.

1778
01:52:20,767 --> 01:52:24,591
Hey! Why did you go to college?
- Oh, God! Please sir...

1779
01:52:26,923 --> 01:52:28,927
Okay. We will meet after tea break.

1780
01:52:29,007 --> 01:52:30,840
Hand over this in office.

1781
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:32,600
Nagesh, you sit.
- Why?

1782
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:33,489
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

1783
01:52:33,569 --> 01:52:34,396
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1784
01:52:35,618 --> 01:52:36,541
You come.

1785
01:52:38,908 --> 01:52:40,725
Vani's classmate.
- I know.

1786
01:52:40,909 --> 01:52:42,683
Sobha!
- She is Deepa.

1787
01:52:43,147 --> 01:52:44,066
Deepa.

1788
01:52:44,146 --> 01:52:45,310
Tell him about it.

1789
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:48,771
Marketraja entered the
class room in search of Vani.

1790
01:52:48,851 --> 01:52:49,972
We got scared.

1791
01:52:50,052 --> 01:52:51,333
He sat with us.

1792
01:52:51,413 --> 01:52:52,687
He was also wearing coat.

1793
01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:54,845
They were speaking in the class.

1794
01:52:55,343 --> 01:52:57,841
Yes. We saw it.

1795
01:52:57,921 --> 01:53:02,005
Marketraja sat in Vaani's
scooty and put his hand around her.

1796
01:53:02,462 --> 01:53:03,285
Enough.

1797
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:05,153
Did you hear?

1798
01:53:05,703 --> 01:53:07,834
Your plan did not work out.

1799
01:53:08,247 --> 01:53:09,313
I am upset.

1800
01:53:10,557 --> 01:53:12,935
You were telling about some
'Syndrom' and told us to wait.

1801
01:53:13,015 --> 01:53:14,054
What to do now?

1802
01:53:14,134 --> 01:53:15,666
He is getting closer to my daughter.

1803
01:53:15,746 --> 01:53:18,124
He holds her with both hands
in scooter. - Nagesh!

1804
01:53:18,204 --> 01:53:20,990
Oh! Shivaji!

1805
01:53:21,603 --> 01:53:24,528
I will not bother if
she had loved a doctor.

1806
01:53:25,024 --> 01:53:26,155
You want me to love a doctor. Right?

1807
01:53:26,235 --> 01:53:28,513
This is a good chance
to make my love a success.

1808
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:29,604
Come.

1809
01:53:29,684 --> 01:53:33,447
He killed a person and forced me to
sign that it is an unclaimed corpse.

1810
01:53:33,527 --> 01:53:35,740
Bloody rascal!
- What did you say?

1811
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:39,142
Is your work over?
- Doctor!

1812
01:53:39,939 --> 01:53:41,877
Your lover Gayatri is waiting.

1813
01:53:41,957 --> 01:53:42,972
Go.
- Gayatri!

1814
01:53:43,052 --> 01:53:44,707
It is different type. Do not bother.

1815
01:53:44,787 --> 01:53:46,099
Shivaji! Nagesh!

1816
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:49,960
I am going to tell a secret to you.

1817
01:53:52,153 --> 01:53:55,387
We have seen a don
becoming doctor in movies.

1818
01:53:55,467 --> 01:53:57,803
Yes or no?
- Yes.

1819
01:53:57,883 --> 01:54:00,004
It is actor Kamalahasan's movie.
We both saw it.

1820
01:54:00,331 --> 01:54:03,630
But in my case a
doctor has become a don.

1821
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:05,476
What nonsense are you talking?

1822
01:54:05,814 --> 01:54:09,550
Yes. Marketraja is a doctor. MBBS.

1823
01:54:09,630 --> 01:54:12,160
Wow! This is medical miracle.

1824
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:13,939
I will not accept it.
- Yes.

1825
01:54:14,019 --> 01:54:15,880
I want to know the
college where he studied

1826
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,159
the year and his
registration number.

1827
01:54:17,239 --> 01:54:19,059
What is his UPRL?

1828
01:54:19,139 --> 01:54:22,069
He studied in Russia long back.

1829
01:54:22,149 --> 01:54:24,075
He has to clear a few papers.

1830
01:54:24,155 --> 01:54:26,400
So he cannot start practice.

1831
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:30,203
In the meantime,
his personal life was affected.

1832
01:54:30,558 --> 01:54:31,899
Twist and turn.

1833
01:54:32,502 --> 01:54:33,640
He became a don.

1834
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:37,028
Oh! The great history of don.

1835
01:54:37,351 --> 01:54:39,884
Though he appears
to be a notorious don.

1836
01:54:40,173 --> 01:54:42,347
He is actually a doctor.

1837
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:45,030
A doctor must be respectable.

1838
01:54:45,110 --> 01:54:47,607
But he has become just the opposite.
- Nagesh!

1839
01:54:49,821 --> 01:54:50,715
Alright.

1840
01:54:51,043 --> 01:54:52,354
I will agree that he is a doctor.

1841
01:54:52,434 --> 01:54:55,020
Show me his certificates.

1842
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:56,122
Why do you want to see certificates?

1843
01:54:56,658 --> 01:55:00,134
Then you will say that it is fake,
bogus or morphing.

1844
01:55:00,608 --> 01:55:02,038
Be practical.

1845
01:55:02,343 --> 01:55:04,323
Conduct an exam.
- Exam?

1846
01:55:04,403 --> 01:55:06,703
You be the examiner
and evaluate his paper.

1847
01:55:06,783 --> 01:55:09,006
No! Let Nagesh correct.

1848
01:55:09,764 --> 01:55:13,723
We, students,
will also write the same exam.

1849
01:55:14,209 --> 01:55:15,417
Just a mock test.

1850
01:55:18,253 --> 01:55:19,054
Done.

1851
01:55:20,230 --> 01:55:22,809
It is Don. Not done.

1852
01:55:23,082 --> 01:55:24,021
Nagesh!
- What?

1853
01:55:24,101 --> 01:55:25,204
I know.
- What do you know?

1854
01:55:25,284 --> 01:55:29,171
Such persons will not
write the exam at all.

1855
01:55:29,251 --> 01:55:30,145
Yes.

1856
01:55:31,186 --> 01:55:32,616
Be serious.

1857
01:55:33,544 --> 01:55:34,411
Okay. Serious.

1858
01:55:34,617 --> 01:55:36,204
If he fails in his exam

1859
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:37,773
you should stop loving him.

1860
01:55:37,853 --> 01:55:38,999
Deal?
- Deal.

1861
01:55:39,079 --> 01:55:40,302
Marketraja!

1862
01:55:40,547 --> 01:55:42,765
The question paper
should be so tough

1863
01:55:42,845 --> 01:55:44,656
that he will never come back here.

1864
01:55:44,736 --> 01:55:48,414
It should be so tough that even
we will fail, if we write the exam.

1865
01:55:49,091 --> 01:55:50,157
Nagesh!
- Yes, Shivaji.

1866
01:55:50,237 --> 01:55:51,843
I want cream of professors

1867
01:55:51,923 --> 01:55:55,435
from all over the world

1868
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:58,356
except Russia because
he studied there.

1869
01:55:58,436 --> 01:55:59,842
Let us get question papers

1870
01:55:59,922 --> 01:56:02,847
from all the medical colleges in the
world and select questions from it.

1871
01:56:02,927 --> 01:56:07,455
I want...
- Shivaji! I will do as you say.

1872
01:56:13,032 --> 01:56:15,135
Hey!

1873
01:56:15,215 --> 01:56:19,100
Pay money and leave the place.

1874
01:56:19,737 --> 01:56:21,641
Tell Market that I told him this.

1875
01:56:22,248 --> 01:56:24,307
I have received some
important information.

1876
01:56:24,387 --> 01:56:25,445
Tell me.

1877
01:56:25,525 --> 01:56:28,531
Manohar Singh,
an encounter specialist

1878
01:56:28,611 --> 01:56:31,564
has been asked to kill Market.
It is a secret.

1879
01:56:31,644 --> 01:56:33,136
What?

1880
01:56:33,216 --> 01:56:36,307
He is Manohar Singh.
He is an expert fighter.

1881
01:56:36,387 --> 01:56:39,548
He came to supply
water can to our shop.

1882
01:56:46,508 --> 01:56:49,728
Let people know about
Market's courage.

1883
01:56:49,905 --> 01:56:51,715
There is a way.

1884
01:56:54,344 --> 01:56:57,078
We have to kill the
encounter specialist.

1885
01:56:58,469 --> 01:57:01,449
But nobody from
our gang should do it.

1886
01:57:01,529 --> 01:57:02,940
You should do it.

1887
01:57:17,623 --> 01:57:19,895
Kill the policeman.

1888
01:57:22,174 --> 01:57:25,128
You are now one of
the members of our gang.

1889
01:58:22,804 --> 01:58:25,449
His behavior has changed
after getting a post in gang.

1890
01:58:27,253 --> 01:58:29,378
Good morning, doctor.
- Okay.

1891
01:58:29,458 --> 01:58:31,073
Good morning, doctor.

1892
01:58:31,153 --> 01:58:32,216
Sit down. Sit down.

1893
01:58:32,988 --> 01:58:34,061
Good morning.
- Okay.

1894
01:58:39,916 --> 01:58:40,984
All the best.

1895
01:58:41,986 --> 01:58:43,482
For exam?
- For the result.

1896
01:58:43,562 --> 01:58:44,723
For love result.

1897
01:58:45,397 --> 01:58:46,641
Nagesh!
- Yes?

1898
01:58:46,721 --> 01:58:48,816
Why are you wishing her
unnecessarily? He is going to fail.

1899
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:55,246
The paper will be easy for you

1900
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:56,853
but difficult for him.

1901
01:58:56,933 --> 01:58:58,390
It is a new technique. Yes.

1902
01:59:33,829 --> 01:59:35,090
Hi!

1903
01:59:39,143 --> 01:59:40,652
Mr Russian doctor!

1904
01:59:41,137 --> 01:59:44,743
You should not shake your
body while writing exam. Sit.

1905
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:56,400
It is time. Take the paper.

1906
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:57,864
Yes. Time out.
- One minute...

1907
01:59:57,944 --> 02:00:00,446
Time over.
- Hey! Time is up.

1908
02:00:03,401 --> 02:00:05,239
What is the result?

1909
02:00:05,319 --> 02:00:06,557
34%

1910
02:00:09,645 --> 02:00:10,988
Oh, God!

1911
02:00:11,068 --> 02:00:14,935
34%! Marketraja has failed.

1912
02:00:15,015 --> 02:00:17,980
It is your daughter's score.

1913
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:19,218
What?

1914
02:00:19,298 --> 02:00:20,490
How much has he scored?

1915
02:00:20,867 --> 02:00:22,487
94%.

1916
02:00:23,825 --> 02:00:24,909
How is it possible?

1917
02:00:24,989 --> 02:00:27,698
I do not know.
- How is it possible?

1918
02:00:28,814 --> 02:00:30,097
Check. Check.

1919
02:00:31,066 --> 02:00:33,266
I told you to set paper for MBBS.

1920
02:00:33,346 --> 02:00:34,463
But it is set for MD,
higher standard.

1921
02:00:34,543 --> 02:00:36,121
Latest nuclear medicine.

1922
02:00:36,201 --> 02:00:38,267
Even I do not know it.
- But he knows.

1923
02:00:38,347 --> 02:00:39,396
94%

1924
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,899
I have passed.

1925
02:00:47,447 --> 02:00:49,328
You are not a don. You are a doctor.

1926
02:00:56,837 --> 02:00:59,774
She is asking about
the convocation date.

1927
02:01:08,686 --> 02:01:10,007
Who are you? Do not come.
- Wait!

1928
02:01:10,269 --> 02:01:11,459
Sir has called us. Come.

1929
02:01:13,353 --> 02:01:15,407
Boss! Boss!

1930
02:01:16,907 --> 02:01:19,712
CM is sitting upstairs.

1931
02:01:20,053 --> 02:01:21,430
Members from Delhi have come.

1932
02:01:21,828 --> 02:01:23,634
There is a secret meeting
going on about coalition.

1933
02:01:23,869 --> 02:01:25,490
Media doesn't know about it.

1934
02:01:25,963 --> 02:01:28,314
But everyone knows
that you are a cheat.

1935
02:01:28,888 --> 02:01:29,795
Avinasi
- Yes, sir.

1936
02:01:29,875 --> 02:01:32,098
Show the poster to Das and Varada.

1937
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:33,682
Yes.

1938
02:01:33,973 --> 02:01:34,798
Election has still
not been announced.

1939
02:01:34,878 --> 02:01:36,347
Have you already printed posters?

1940
02:01:39,662 --> 02:01:40,769
Hey!
- Hey!

1941
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:42,336
Tearful tribute to Marketraja.

1942
02:01:43,004 --> 02:01:46,652
Marketraja is dead.

1943
02:01:46,732 --> 02:01:49,683
From Das, Varada and people
of Perambur constituency.

1944
02:01:49,763 --> 02:01:50,741
Our name is mentioned.

1945
02:01:53,604 --> 02:01:55,127
How is the poster?

1946
02:01:57,394 --> 02:01:59,237
I am going to paste
it in the whole area.

1947
02:01:59,317 --> 02:02:01,019
Sir, please do not act in a hurry.

1948
02:02:01,099 --> 02:02:02,007
Yes, sir.

1949
02:02:02,087 --> 02:02:03,933
Marketraja...

1950
02:02:05,178 --> 02:02:07,848
Police and rowdies
may be scared of him.

1951
02:02:07,928 --> 02:02:11,203
But I am Godfather.

1952
02:02:11,283 --> 02:02:14,626
Godfather. King of master plan.

1953
02:02:14,706 --> 02:02:16,300
Sir...
- Hey!

1954
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:19,266
CM is there.
- We really do not know

1955
02:02:19,346 --> 02:02:21,943
about the deal between
you and Marketraja.

1956
02:02:23,375 --> 02:02:24,704
He is a strong guy.
Doesn't reveal any secret.

1957
02:02:24,784 --> 02:02:26,705
Okay. I will tell now.

1958
02:02:27,072 --> 02:02:33,217
It was cash, documents
and papers worth 5.5 billion.

1959
02:02:33,297 --> 02:02:36,819
I told him to keep it
safely without informing you.

1960
02:02:36,899 --> 02:02:39,245
But he has deceived me.

1961
02:02:39,325 --> 02:02:40,636
Let me think about it.

1962
02:02:40,716 --> 02:02:44,257
That day he left you
and went with Godfather.

1963
02:02:44,337 --> 02:02:46,557
He returned back in the morning
with this sofa given by Steffani.

1964
02:02:47,049 --> 02:02:50,074
Then he must have
gone to Steffani's house.

1965
02:02:50,154 --> 02:02:51,098
Isn't it?
- Yes.

1966
02:02:51,178 --> 02:02:52,610
There is only one way.

1967
02:02:53,073 --> 02:02:54,869
Let us take him to Steffani.

1968
02:02:54,949 --> 02:02:57,706
We can find out the place where
the documents are kept through him.

1969
02:02:58,652 --> 02:03:01,180
Where is Steffani?

1970
02:06:23,542 --> 02:06:24,647
Sit!

1971
02:06:35,135 --> 02:06:36,353
Market!

1972
02:06:39,937 --> 02:06:41,495
Yes. Steffani!

1973
02:06:42,067 --> 02:06:45,060
The other day I gave
you something to keep safely.

1974
02:06:45,414 --> 02:06:46,236
Where is it?

1975
02:06:46,542 --> 02:06:49,123
What are you talking about?

1976
02:06:49,839 --> 02:06:51,089
Where is it?

1977
02:06:52,838 --> 02:06:56,867
Market!
I have been yearning for you.

1978
02:06:57,283 --> 02:06:58,381
You did not come to me.

1979
02:06:58,461 --> 02:07:00,524
Why are you asking
when you never came to me?

1980
02:07:00,604 --> 02:07:03,903
Das! No connection between
Steffani and the treasure.

1981
02:07:03,983 --> 02:07:04,995
Never mind.

1982
02:07:05,739 --> 02:07:08,697
I am that treasure. Take me.

1983
02:07:09,682 --> 02:07:12,580
Come on Market. Take me.

1984
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:14,667
I cannot forget the terrace.

1985
02:07:14,918 --> 02:07:16,229
Terrace!

1986
02:07:22,673 --> 02:07:23,966
Madam, please leave me.

1987
02:07:24,046 --> 02:07:27,557
I love Vani, daughter
of dean of our medical college.

1988
02:07:30,986 --> 02:07:32,775
Market!
- Please do not touch me.

1989
02:07:36,181 --> 02:07:38,278
Market.
- Market?

1990
02:07:38,564 --> 02:07:41,481
I am Chandrababu
studying 4th year MBBS.

1991
02:07:41,838 --> 02:07:43,340
In Government medical college.

1992
02:07:48,612 --> 02:07:49,958
Vani!

1993
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:52,494
Vani?
- I have lost my honor.

1994
02:07:53,588 --> 02:07:59,010
Market is a coward.

1995
02:08:00,958 --> 02:08:04,611
Why are you all calling me 'Market'?

1996
02:08:05,110 --> 02:08:08,757
Vani! Is Market
possessed by some spirit?

1997
02:08:28,038 --> 02:08:30,508
Stop there.

1998
02:08:32,591 --> 02:08:34,681
"Shivoham!"

1999
02:09:16,924 --> 02:09:18,674
"Shivoham!"

2000
02:09:22,875 --> 02:09:25,277
There are two souls in his body.

2001
02:09:25,818 --> 02:09:28,680
One is sleeping and
the other is hiding.

2002
02:09:29,112 --> 02:09:30,058
Do you understand?

2003
02:09:30,138 --> 02:09:32,409
Yes. The soul has
not attained peace.

2004
02:09:32,489 --> 02:09:33,816
"Shivoham!"

2005
02:09:35,215 --> 02:09:36,851
I will be in graveyard.

2006
02:09:37,517 --> 02:09:40,700
A Puja for God Ashtabhairava
will be performed at 2 am

2007
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:42,459
Bring him there.
- Okay.

2008
02:09:42,539 --> 02:09:48,073
The soul will attain peace.

2009
02:09:58,140 --> 02:10:00,764
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

2010
02:10:00,844 --> 02:10:03,260
"Hail Lord Shiva!"

2011
02:10:04,623 --> 02:10:05,673
Good time has come.

2012
02:10:05,753 --> 02:10:07,661
We will get back our Market.
- Right!

2013
02:10:07,741 --> 02:10:09,298
Our problems will be solved.

2014
02:10:19,342 --> 02:10:21,462
"Shivoham!"

2015
02:10:26,231 --> 02:10:29,477
Come, Ramdas.

2016
02:10:29,557 --> 02:10:33,595
You spoke to my guru in Varanasi.

2017
02:10:34,295 --> 02:10:38,701
I will obey the orders of my guru.

2018
02:10:46,212 --> 02:10:49,909
Tonight the soul
inside him will be freed

2019
02:10:50,844 --> 02:10:53,625
and he will also be killed.

2020
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,084
I will come to your house at dawn.

2021
02:10:57,164 --> 02:10:58,774
Alright. Alright.

2022
02:10:58,854 --> 02:11:01,618
There should not be any
trace of Marketraja afterwards.

2023
02:11:01,901 --> 02:11:03,595
"Shivoham!"

2024
02:11:05,059 --> 02:11:07,227
We are Agoras,
people who eat humans.

2025
02:11:07,590 --> 02:11:09,790
We are very hungry.

2026
02:11:10,609 --> 02:11:13,943
We will devour him.

2027
02:11:27,856 --> 02:11:29,734
Hello!
- Is it Vani?

2028
02:11:30,150 --> 02:11:30,992
Has dean started?

2029
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:32,150
Yes.

2030
02:11:32,448 --> 02:11:35,462
I have some important
information about Market.

2031
02:11:50,279 --> 02:11:52,593
Come. Get down.
- No!

2032
02:11:52,673 --> 02:11:54,761
No.
- Get down. Come out.

2033
02:11:55,659 --> 02:11:58,320
Come. Listen to me.
- No.

2034
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,899
Come. Come.
- No.

2035
02:12:01,083 --> 02:12:05,194
Come. Come on.
- Come on. Take him.

2036
02:12:05,274 --> 02:12:06,597
No.

2037
02:12:08,436 --> 02:12:09,526
Oh, God!

2038
02:12:15,028 --> 02:12:16,916
Wait.

2039
02:12:23,192 --> 02:12:25,838
"Shivoham!"

2040
02:12:34,815 --> 02:12:36,427
Market is getting hurt.

2041
02:12:37,574 --> 02:12:39,257
Do not pity Market.

2042
02:12:39,337 --> 02:12:41,117
It is Chandrababu
who is being beaten.

2043
02:12:41,944 --> 02:12:43,897
He is getting beaten.

2044
02:13:01,921 --> 02:13:05,179
Das! Take away Market from here.

2045
02:13:05,259 --> 02:13:06,062
Please...

2046
02:13:06,142 --> 02:13:08,013
Keep quiet. Do not irritate me.

2047
02:13:08,093 --> 02:13:11,309
Please listen to me. - He is driving
away the spirit inside him.

2048
02:13:11,389 --> 02:13:12,659
See.

2049
02:13:15,628 --> 02:13:20,512
This person has been sent by Ramdas
to kill Market. - What?

2050
02:13:20,592 --> 02:13:23,753
Steffani called and told me.
Please save Market.

2051
02:13:23,833 --> 02:13:25,338
Das!
- Go.

2052
02:13:26,579 --> 02:13:27,751
Hey!

2053
02:13:28,657 --> 02:13:29,887
Das!

2054
02:13:32,766 --> 02:13:34,871
Das!
- Oh, God! Das!

2055
02:13:58,771 --> 02:14:01,533
Wait...

2056
02:14:05,762 --> 02:14:09,609
Vani, he is beating me.

2057
02:14:09,689 --> 02:14:12,060
See, there is blood on me.

2058
02:14:15,470 --> 02:14:18,785
He hit my legs.

2059
02:14:18,865 --> 02:14:20,158
Tell him not to beat me.

2060
02:14:20,238 --> 02:14:22,311
Please tell him.
- "Shivoham!"

2061
02:14:22,391 --> 02:14:24,246
Tell him not to beat me.

2062
02:14:24,326 --> 02:14:27,935
'If Vani's lips replace
this mouthorgan and I get a kiss'

2063
02:14:29,122 --> 02:14:33,685
'my wish will be fulfilled.'

2064
02:14:34,441 --> 02:14:38,000
'It will release my soul.'

2065
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:12,312
Chandrababu, are you satisfied now?

2066
02:15:13,063 --> 02:15:14,235
I like you.

2067
02:15:15,256 --> 02:15:16,630
Your life is over.

2068
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:17,932
Know it.

2069
02:15:18,522 --> 02:15:20,265
Go away from here.

2070
02:15:22,458 --> 02:15:24,212
Please go away.

2071
02:15:24,292 --> 02:15:25,660
'Princess.'

2072
02:15:32,962 --> 02:15:34,657
'My princess.'

2073
02:16:08,358 --> 02:16:10,348
Market, have you woken up?

2074
02:16:10,428 --> 02:16:12,091
Who sent you?

2075
02:16:12,171 --> 02:16:14,011
Come...

2076
02:16:14,435 --> 02:16:18,335
Lord Shiva has woken you
because I should not fight a coward.

2077
02:16:20,717 --> 02:16:23,214
Come. Come.

2078
02:16:26,386 --> 02:16:28,333
Vani, he is Market.
- HIt him. Don't spare him.

2079
02:16:28,413 --> 02:16:31,115
You go away from here.
- No. I will not go.

2080
02:16:34,336 --> 02:16:36,656
You should not stay here
and see this. - Go.

2081
02:16:36,736 --> 02:16:37,735
Why?

2082
02:16:38,871 --> 02:16:40,214
Varada!
- Yes.

2083
02:16:40,469 --> 02:16:42,152
I...
- You can meet him tomorrow.

2084
02:16:42,232 --> 02:16:43,122
Go now.

2085
02:16:43,202 --> 02:16:45,295
I want to see Market fighting.
- Come on. Go.

2086
02:17:43,923 --> 02:17:45,295
Market!

2087
02:17:53,241 --> 02:17:57,141
"He is an expert in fighting."

2088
02:17:57,221 --> 02:18:03,901
"Can handle any weapons!"

2089
02:18:03,981 --> 02:18:06,484
"Do you still have any doubt?"

2090
02:18:06,564 --> 02:18:11,639
"He is Marketraja, the don."

2091
02:18:41,361 --> 02:18:43,348
Who parked the Scooty there?

2092
02:18:43,428 --> 02:18:44,613
Who is that?
- Das.

2093
02:18:44,907 --> 02:18:47,072
Still not got collection
from Malladi. Ask him to come.

2094
02:18:47,152 --> 02:18:48,423
Yes. I will go now
and tell him to come.

2095
02:18:48,503 --> 02:18:49,681
Why are you staring at me?

2096
02:18:49,979 --> 02:18:52,438
Have you not seen me before?
- Greet me.

2097
02:18:52,518 --> 02:18:54,375
Hey Das! Why has she come here?

2098
02:18:54,455 --> 02:18:56,173
Ask her the reason
and send her back.

2099
02:18:56,253 --> 02:18:57,635
Why has she come here now?

2100
02:18:58,624 --> 02:19:00,041
Market!
- Oh!

2101
02:19:02,574 --> 02:19:04,473
Have you come again?

2102
02:19:04,553 --> 02:19:05,864
I have warned you
to leave me and go.

2103
02:19:05,944 --> 02:19:07,210
But you are not listening.

2104
02:19:07,714 --> 02:19:11,119
You will listen only if
I treat you like Sundaribai.

2105
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:14,878
What is this?

2106
02:19:17,797 --> 02:19:20,051
Who plays this here?

2107
02:19:23,769 --> 02:19:27,152
Where are our boys?
- Boys, come up.

2108
02:19:29,006 --> 02:19:31,236
Call and find out if Godfather
has returned from Dubai.

2109
02:19:31,641 --> 02:19:33,035
I misplaced my phone.

2110
02:19:33,764 --> 02:19:35,652
Come here.

2111
02:19:37,682 --> 02:19:39,835
He saved my life yesterday night.

2112
02:19:40,095 --> 02:19:42,619
Stay here. Stay with me.
- Okay boss.

2113
02:19:42,699 --> 02:19:45,083
He was asking about 'liquor'.

2114
02:19:45,163 --> 02:19:47,141
Why did he tell you
about our private deal?

2115
02:19:47,651 --> 02:19:49,946
Why is she standing here?
Tell her to go.

2116
02:19:50,264 --> 02:19:51,128
Get lost.

2117
02:19:52,056 --> 02:19:54,033
You all go that side.

2118
02:19:58,009 --> 02:19:59,126
Know one thing.

2119
02:20:00,541 --> 02:20:04,426
The real reason you
are alive is because of her.

2120
02:20:04,506 --> 02:20:06,417
Do you know what happened to you?

2121
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:23,203
Poor girl.
- Das!

2122
02:20:25,690 --> 02:20:26,593
Stop it.

2123
02:20:28,545 --> 02:20:30,943
Whatever I told to
Chandrababu suits me also.

2124
02:20:31,733 --> 02:20:33,603
A one sided love is not love at all.

2125
02:20:34,729 --> 02:20:35,616
It is just a crush.

2126
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:37,901
I thought the recent incidents

2127
02:20:38,335 --> 02:20:40,435
happened by fate, for my sake.

2128
02:20:41,099 --> 02:20:41,915
No.

2129
02:20:42,870 --> 02:20:43,795
No.

2130
02:20:45,745 --> 02:20:49,508
These incidents happened
for the sake of a poor dumb mother.

2131
02:20:49,914 --> 02:20:53,661
I realized it only now.

2132
02:20:56,437 --> 02:20:57,641
With great difficulty

2133
02:20:57,721 --> 02:20:59,725
I took permission from my father
that Market should

2134
02:20:59,805 --> 02:21:01,357
attend the convocation.

2135
02:21:03,414 --> 02:21:05,062
But it will not happen.

2136
02:21:05,903 --> 02:21:09,915
A person lost his life
because of my mistake.

2137
02:21:09,995 --> 02:21:12,274
I have atoned for that sin.

2138
02:21:15,786 --> 02:21:19,543
I am always an 'ice
cream photo' for you.

2139
02:21:20,666 --> 02:21:21,942
Bye.

2140
02:22:24,204 --> 02:22:25,851
He said...

2141
02:22:25,931 --> 02:22:27,315
Father.

2142
02:22:30,287 --> 02:22:31,803
That's the doctor who got 1st rank.

2143
02:23:25,322 --> 02:23:27,412
I do not do such things normally.

2144
02:23:27,707 --> 02:23:30,768
But a part of the person
inside me is making me do it.

2145
02:23:31,657 --> 02:23:33,066
I will take care of mother.

2146
02:23:42,257 --> 02:23:45,000
Where is doctor going?

2147
02:23:45,508 --> 02:23:47,610
He is not a doctor.

2148
02:23:48,147 --> 02:23:51,017
He is a don.
- I pity doctor girl.

2149
02:23:51,097 --> 02:23:52,381
Sundaribai is responsible for it.

2150
02:23:52,461 --> 02:23:54,775
Das, tell Sundaribai to come home.

2151
02:24:02,744 --> 02:24:03,829
Godfather!

2152
02:24:08,264 --> 02:24:09,757
Your treasure is inside the sofa.

2153
02:24:14,736 --> 02:24:15,591
'Well done.'

2154
02:24:19,163 --> 02:24:20,553
'Continue...'

2155
02:24:21,336 --> 02:24:23,127
'I was eighteen then.
- What happened?'

2156
02:24:23,207 --> 02:24:25,849
'I was attacked at that time.
- Continue.'

2157
02:24:25,929 --> 02:24:27,525
'I fought with them
and drove them away.'

2158
02:24:27,605 --> 02:24:29,286
'He turned and saw a girl.'

2159
02:24:29,366 --> 02:24:30,598
'He saw her.'

2160
02:24:30,678 --> 02:24:33,857
'She left her husband
and came to him.'

2161
02:24:33,937 --> 02:24:36,388
'I was an ordinary person then.'

2162
02:24:36,468 --> 02:24:37,662
'But now?'

2163
02:24:38,722 --> 02:24:40,303
'Continue...'

2164
02:24:52,556 --> 02:24:54,286
'Continue...'

2165
02:25:03,726 --> 02:25:05,129
'Continue...'

2166
02:25:05,209 --> 02:25:08,241
'I was used to killing people
by the time I was 21.'

2167
02:25:08,321 --> 02:25:09,956
'Started earning lot of money.'

2168
02:25:10,036 --> 02:25:13,028
A girl entered my heart
at that time. - Wow!

2169
02:25:13,108 --> 02:25:17,822
"She was very beautiful."

2170
02:25:17,902 --> 02:25:22,607
"Suitable for me."

2171
02:25:22,687 --> 02:25:24,340
I told her that I love her.

2172
02:25:24,420 --> 02:25:26,226
'I gave her a rose
expressing my love.'

2173
02:25:26,306 --> 02:25:28,650
And she accepted it.

2174
02:25:28,730 --> 02:25:30,444
Suddenly another
man entered her life.

2175
02:25:30,524 --> 02:25:32,841
And I was heartbroken.

2176
02:25:59,660 --> 02:26:00,498
Get lost!
