"My greetings to the
moral of the music."

00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:07,128

Oh the lord of yoga

Since ages you the chivalry

00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:41,936
You are the boon giver
for the meditaion.

"You are the donor and the
richest amongst the rich."

10
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,184
You the couple Ishwar
and Parvati,

11
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,358
You are the creator
of the universe

12
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,230
This is the reward of the
Yagna. Offered to you.

13

exhibition of this reward.

The king with the sunshine..

38
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,945
...glow and the glorious king
Harishchandra has performed,

39
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,347
...this Yagna not for himself..

40
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,186
...but for the welfare
of his subjects.

41
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,386
<i>This deed of his has brought
great happiness to us.</i>

42
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,160
Hermit, these are all your
blessing. I am touched.

43
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,090
Harishchandra! Be honest
towards your duties.

44
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,963
Work for the welfare
of the people.

45
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:29,934
Rule the kingdom with dignity.

46
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,138
So be it. Harishchandra, I
am one of the travelers.

47
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,676
Who are you? What do you want?

48
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,119
I am a devotee. I have
heard about..

49
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,518
...your great principals
and deeds

50
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,121
So I've one doubt.

51
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,123
Come on tell me what is it?

52
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,523
Whatever you have earned with
the help of the hermit..

53
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,631
...whatever you have, you will
have to use it for your people..

54
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:54,128
...you will not use anything
unless you finish..

55
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,733
...with the people
of your kingdom.

56
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,226
Am I right? -Yes very much.

57
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:02,404
Then I am asking for something.
Will I get?

58
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:08,406
Without any hesitation. Whatever
I can I will definitely give.

59
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:09,579
In that case..

60
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:14,380
...why do you need this divine
gem? Give it to me.

61
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,519
With pleasure.

62
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,150
Your highness!

63
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,526
Your highness!

64
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,163
Will you give away this
reward which..

65
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,528
...you have earned with
lots of efforts?

66
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,265
King who is committed to the
welfare of his kingdom..

67
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,169
...don't ask for rewards
and if given..

68
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,302
...do not deserve to receive it.

69
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,308
Hermit, I don't know
who you are..

70
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,246
...but by coming here you've
honored me and my kingdom.

71
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,055
Please accept this.

72
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,319
Harishchandra!

73
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,927
You don't have to worry
about anything.

74
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:06,202
I will use it only when needed.

75
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,930
Bless you.

76
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,213
My lord my instincts are
reminding me of something..

77
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,979
...the moment I saw this hermit.

78
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:32,623
Yes dear, we are blessed that we
were given this opportunity

79
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,298
Hail Lord Shiva!

80
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,344
Mahendra! The one who was
always entertained..

81
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,110
...by the eternal music
and the dance,

82
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,348
we are very happy with
the hospitality..

83
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:38,149
...you offered to us.
What is your wish?

84
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,354
Hermit Vishwamitra! What
else can we wish?

85
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,351
This session has been
arranged to discuss..

86
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,192
...the welfare of the
people of earth.

87
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,366
For this reason I ask
you if there is

88
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,365
any such procedure for a human..

89
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:55,069
...being may it be rich or poor,
small or big, young or old..

90
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,374
...without the help of any money
or meditation and just..

91
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:00,374
...following a simple culture
of living, can..

92
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,377
...he achieve the best
out of this life.

93
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,410
Thyself the learned!

94
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,446
Now you need to give
us the solution.

95
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,381
Vishwamitra! You have been
the one who has been..

96
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,491
...proving things on this
earth in deeds.

97
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,859
You definitely must have a
solution, please tell us.

98
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:25,898
Mahendra! Every individual will
have a different solution.

99
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:31,966
There is no common solution
for a human being as such

100
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,002
Hermit Vashistha! ..

101
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,410
...what do you think about this?

102
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:43,549
Mahendra! This is just for the
information of those who..

103
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,925
The most effective,
the most useful..

104
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,430
...and experienced solution
of all is..

105
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,658
...the solution of
truth-Satyavrata

106
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,264
What did you say? Satyavrata?

107
00:10:58,558 --> 00:10:59,434
Yes Mahendra! Truth is
the only culture..

108
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,165
...and solution of a
human being's life.

109
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,374
Truth is the ultimate.

110
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,942
There is no culture
beyond truth.

111
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,480
Truth is the only support
to this earth.

112
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,446
True Rushi Vashishtha!
Whatever..

113
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,051
...you are saying
is the ultimate.

114
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,454
You have made it very
simple for a human..

115
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:18,521
...being to understand
and use it.

116
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,489
Gautama! It is easy to preach
but very difficult to do.

117
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,460
It is next to impossible
for one to..

118
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,893
...go by this principle of truth,

119
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,861
the so called support
of the universe.

120
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,461
Why such a hasty conclusion
Vishwamitra?

121
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:39,172
Mahendra! There is one such
person who can adopt..

122
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:44,479
...this culture and prove
it that it can be done.

123
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,210
Hermit Vashishtha, we are all
eager to know about him..

124
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,484
...who is that most
fortunate one.

125
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,320
Mahendra, please listen
carefully.

126
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,421
A resident of earth who
deserves to serve the..

127
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,587
...heavenly sages, a great
king, idol of honesty..

128
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,931
...the rich and treasured, the
real ruler of the kingdom.

129
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:07,534
The eternal achiever and idol
of good deeds, the king..

130
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,237
...of Ayodhya, Shri Harishchandra
Chakravarti.

131
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:15,242
Who is that idol of truth?
King Harishchandra?

132
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,910
Harishchandra? Harishchandra?

133
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:24,847
You have forgotten hermit
Vishwamitra that king..

134
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,292
...Harishchandra you are laughing
at with disgrace..

135
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,525
...is from your own community.

136
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,527
So what? Whoever he belongs
to There is..

137
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:33,960
...no one who can defeat
my intelligence.

138
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,527
This Vashistha is cleverly
trying to prove his principles..

139
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:44,574
...right by using a person
like Harishchandra!

140
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,568
Mahendra, you make accept
whatever he is saying but..

141
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,540
...but I am not ready to
accept this at all.

142
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,280
Don't we understand the behavior
of a human being?

143
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,019
Theft, lie, fraud, adamant,
heartlessness, diehard.

144
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,655
Eternally heir the throne of
their ancestors, always..

145
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,390
...being non compassionate
and enjoying the kingly..

146
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,991
...pleasures without even wasting
a minute to do so.

147
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:07,155
It is unbelievable that a king
do exist on this earth who is..

148
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:12,566
...living a common man's
life being a king.

149
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:18,372
Vishwamitra! It is no use hiding
the truth by arguments.

150
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,310
Do you consider Harishchandra
as only a king?

151
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:28,051
Every drop of blood flowing in
his veins is full of truth.

152
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:33,289
No one on this earth can beat
his devotion towards truth.

153
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,593
As long as they are on
the king's throne..

154
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:39,595
...they possess every
good quality.

155
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,593
. Every bad deed of a
authority is always..

156
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,895
...considered to be
a welfare deed.

157
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,601
But once he looses
everything on..

158
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:53,268
...this earth all
his principles..

159
00:13:53,399 --> 00:14:01,443
...his deeds his commitments
etc vanish within no time.

160
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:06,613
Vishwamitra! Harishchandra not
only in his bad times, but..

161
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:12,059
...in his dreams, smiles
will never leave truth.

162
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,625
Then in that case
I will see to..

163
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,096
...it that I force
your follower..

164
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,493
...Harishchandra to sacrifice the
truth, by troubling and..

165
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,636
...pushing him into hardships
and agonies..

166
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,500
...of life and prove him wrong.

167
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:25,970
Vishwamitra! You seem to be the
preacher to the universe, ..

168
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,275
...only because of your ego and
just to prove someone wrong

169
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,641
will you force the innocent
Harishchandra to..

170
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,271
...spoil his character, culture
and principles?

171
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,848
You don't have to get scared
of it Mahendra!

172
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,087
For once Bramha may err in his
speech, sun, moon may..

173
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,350
...forget their duties and get
ruined, the earth may tremor..

174
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,929
...and all the planets may get
destroyed and thousands..

175
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,663
...of such hermits may get
together to fulfill such a..

176
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,334
...ungraceful and shameful wish
but in any point of time..

177
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,466
...Harshchandra will never leave
his principle of truth.

178
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,039
Will he not? But I will do
it. And prove you wrong.

179
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,108
If at all this happens then
I promise now that I will..

180
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:07,314
...sacrifice my preaching and
forget that I am a hermit..

181
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,287
...will sit on the truth's back
and become a drunkard..

182
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:18,362
...facing south and you're
your curses forever.

183
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:23,058
Yes hermit Vashistha, you have
given him the best challenge.

184
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,698
Bramharishis, hermit's
Now this is..

185
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,273
...the matter of my
prestige and ego.

186
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,277
Who is this? Vishwamitra.

187
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,277
The one who shook this universe,

188
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,576
conquered the five elements..

189
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,420
...of the galaxy and who can show
the dome's day to this earth.

190
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,080
This is Vishwamitra.

191
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,053
Who can go beyond the rules of
universe and fulfill his wish

192
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,356
...for whom nothing is
impossible. This Vishwamitra

193
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,064
I will distract his
mental stability

194
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:59,603
and force him to
go against truth

195
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,805
or else the boons which
are earned by me from

196
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,167
...the Bramhas by meditating
for so many years will be..

197
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,139
...divided and shared
with Harishchandra.

198
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,574
He will be given all the
treasures of life, eternal..

199
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,750
...kinghood of the kingdom
and prosperity..

200
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,447
...for his next fourteen
generations.

201
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:20,751
Other than this he will
also be offered and..

202
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,326
...honored the throne of
heavenly king Indra.

203
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,019
This is my wow!

204
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,625
My beloved! My lord!

205
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,426
My dear! What happened?

206
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:39,042
I dreamt of some weird looking
person forcibly throwing you..

207
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,543
...out of your throne.

208
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,915
Don't get scared dear
Don't get scared.

209
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,554
God in disguise of truth is
always there to take care of us

210
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:03,058
The egg! The womb! And universe!

211
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,801
In this complicated language
means what?

212
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,361
Very difficult.

213
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,496
Nakshatrika! Listen!

214
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,803
Hey don't disturb me.

215
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,808
The egg! The womb! And universe!

216
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,437
In this complicated language
means what? Very difficult.

217
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,210
Let it be. Master! Hermit
Vishwamitra..

218
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,317
...is here with a rage and
anger on his face.

219
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,887
Let him come. -I will ask
him the meaning of it.

220
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:29,460
I will prove that I too
am his disciple.

221
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,290
Nakshatrika! Yes master

222
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,193
My greetings to you My
master my greetings.

223
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,823
You are the first master
to this universe..

224
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,958
...I am you first disciple.

225
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:43,596
Come on get up I will,
only on one condition.

226
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,136

227
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,868
Means The egg! The womb!
And universe! In this..

228
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,309
To hell with it.

229
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,451
Thought he was angry he preached
and did you hear..

230
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,848
...what did he preach?

231
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,013
He said in the egg, the womb
and the universe is my egg.

232
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,250
Nakshatrika come here.
-Yes master?

233
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,622
I must fulfill my promise.

234
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:08,091
I must defeat that
hermit Vishwamitra

235
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,990
the egotist I must make
Harishchandra lie and misbehave.

236
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,633
Oh master! So you brought
this job from the heaven?

237
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,997
Nakshatrika!

238
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,869
Sir it is very difficult to
get such a thing done..

239
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,499
...from that great king of
truth Harishchandra.

240
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,873
What is so difficult in it?
Nothing is impossible..

241
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,003
...for this hermit Vishwamitra.

242
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:32,082
In this task I am ready to use
every dirt trick I can.

...a compassionate
protector is busy

251

donating things to the
people of his kingdom.

252
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,963
Nakshtrika! In such a time"

253
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,872
...the king has to donate
whatever a Maharish asks for.

254
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,346
Or else he will be a sinner.

255
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,948
While asking we need
to ask something..

256
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:32,947
...very intelligently
and thoughtfully.

257
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:36,315
On the tallest of
all elephants..

258
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:39,946
...making a tallest man stand
and asking him to throw a..

259
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,283
...coin as high as he can and
till the farthest the coin goes,

260
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:47,262
...will be how much which we
will ask for gold coins.

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,461
Shut up! Come on stop

Enough.

263
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,971
So you have found a solution
for it on your own.

264
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,570

Please go ahead and tell me
I will definitely obey.

281
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,959

282
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,306
...for affection. All the
necessary things required

283
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,806
for this ritual will be
supplied.. by you.

284
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:09,107
King Harishchandra, The powers
of my master are great.

285
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,076
Kubera too is at his command.

286
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:17,449
A single order and everything
will be here.

287
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,556
But my master is insisting on
getting this done from you.

288
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,890
I am honored. Please tell me,
how much money do you want?

289
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,060
On the tallest of all elephants,

290
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,060
, making a tallest man
stand and asking him..

291
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,496
...to throw a coin as
high as he can and..

292
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,896
...till the farthest
the coin goes

293
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:39,407
will be the amount of
gold coins I need.

294
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,510
The moment you asked for
it, its all yours.

295
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,083
Master! Master! Are you
worrying about..

296
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:55,158
...how will we carry so
much amount home?

297
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,652
Satyakirti according to
hermit's wish arrange..

298
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,198
...for the money he has asked
for and send it..

299
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,167
...across on an elephant
to hermit's ashram.

300
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,836
Yes your highness.

301
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,164
Harishchandra I am very happy
with your generosity..

302
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,110
...but it is not necessary
to send the..

303
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,405
...whole amount at once
to my heritage.

304
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,908
There are many more tasks
to be completed.

305
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,111
As soon as the decision is
taken for performing..

306
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,583
...the ritual I will let you know

307
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,118
you can then send the
money. Until then..

308
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,121
...let my money remain
safely with you.

309
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,456
Hermit you are very well aware
of everything that..

310
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,221
...the time doesn't remain
the same. Isn't it?

311
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:40,136
I suggest you to take away
your money with you.

312
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:44,536
That means you are disrespecting
me by telling..

313
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:48,509
...me that you are unable to
keep my money with you?

314
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,211
Forgive us hermit. We
will do as you wish.

315
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:54,983
Alright then.

316
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:13,162
Nakshatrika! I am the
almighty, nothing..

317
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,169
...is impossible for me. Now see.

318
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:29,415
Oh! Master why do you
do such scary things.

319
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:34,520
Not only scary but it must
create a havoc in the kingdom

320
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:44,967
Oh god, it is creating a hovoc.

321
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:50,263
It not only has to create havoc
but also it must force..

322
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:53,309
...the king Harishchandra to come
for the rescue of this..

323
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:57,470
...forest and then must get
trapped in my dirty trick.

324
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:33,941
Oh King! Your highness. Save us.

325
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,551
People please don't be scared.

326
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,180

Please tell me your problem
without any fear.

328
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,288
All of a sudden the wild
animals have become ..

00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,394
...aggressive and have entered
our villages and ..

330

342
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:14,437
Problem is that I am a bit
confused whether you have..

343
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:18,844
...have trapped Harishchandra of
Harishchandra has trapped you?

344
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,177
You know why?

345
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,409
You thought he will
not be able to..

346
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,020
...give to that amount but he did

347
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:28,421
Instead of bringing that money
with you, you kept it with him,

348
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:32,029
after that you created will
animals full of forest.

349
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,132
He came and just killed
them all and won.

350
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,460
What happened to your wow?

351
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,166
What happened?

352
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,429
I have separated him from
his family and..

353
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,438
...brought him to this
lonely place.

354
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:48,435
Now I have decided to part him
away from his truth just see.

355
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:59,522
We are born We are born -We
are grown We are grown.

356
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,258
Where is my groom?-Where
is my beloved?

357
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,826
Nakshatrika! Did you
see my girls?

358
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:10,326
Who can create such a beauty?

359
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,330
Only you can create such
a beauty master.

360
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,901
Pretty girls

361
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,167
Oh this is my man.

me Please save me.

363
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:27,108

364
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,479
<i>Not me.</i>

365
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,920
King Harishchandra? -King
Harishchandra?

366
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,182
Hey dear come on
Come on lets go.

367
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:37,856
Hey ladies wait. Where are
you going? Come back.

368
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,121
Do you know who is king
Harishchandra?

369
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,992
Where is he? What is he doing
now? And can you find him?

370
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,202
Hey dear do you know?
Do you know?

371
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,495
Hey you tell us. Make it fast.

372
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:52,170
Girls I have created a beautiful
garden close by.

373
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,137
King Harishchandra will come
there to take some rest.

374
00:28:55,567 --> 00:29:00,880
You will have to seduce him some
how and get married to him

375
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,517
. Oh ! is it? Come lets
go. -Hey wait.

376
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:06,452
Where are flying like a wind?

377
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,388
Come back come back He
hasn't finished yet.

378
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:10,524
If King Harishchandra
ask you about..

379
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:13,528
...yourself, what will you say?

380
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,527
Now that you are hermit's
creations tell..

381
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:19,534
...him that you are
his daughters.

382
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:20,864
<i>- Ow.!</i>

383
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,544
I thought they may make
a mistake somewhere so.

384
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,541
Nakshatrika! You do have brains.

385
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,980
Master sometimes I don't
understand what you say.

386
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:40,150
If these girls get married to
him, what will we achieve?

387
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:45,890
Nakshatrika! If King
Harishchandra gets married ..

388
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,561
...to these girls will
he not deceive his..

389
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,757
...legally wedded wife
and do a sin?

390
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:50,559
Then?

391
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,260
Then will that not take him
far away from the truth?

392
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:57,431
Oh! Understood Understood.
Now you will win.

393
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,199
In a lonely place like this if
someone gets such a beauty..

...how can one resist himself?
You also were fallen for Menaka?

Hail oh golden King Hail

00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,319
The cold breeze is slipping
down my veil.

414
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,454
And that makes my body shiver.

415
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,090
And that makes my body shiver.

416
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:45,170
Without waiting for a minute

Thus we have lost ourselves
Oh King.

418

419
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:58,752
Thus we have lost ourselves
Oh King.

420

Kalki Mari has lost her pride.

423
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:37,791
Kalki Mari has lost her pride.

424
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,897
Within no time we have lost

00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,916
And the heart is full

And the heart is full

00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:25,160
...not accept us we will
be disheartened..

440
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,894
...and then this youth
will be useless.

441
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,902
What will happen to our beauty?

442
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,700
Why are you silent? Please
speak oh king

443
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,503
Marry please oh king.

444
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,911
You both are out of your
senses, you girls.

445
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:38,839
You are trying to seduce
me? Stop it all.

446
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:44,250
Your highness, you are here.
Who are these girls?

447
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,056
Send them back with all
dignity and respect.

448
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:48,915
We don't want any dignity
your highness..

449
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,355
...we want your affection.

450
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,519
Get married, your highness.
Get married.

451
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,388
Our birth is only for you.

452
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,793
If you don't hold my hand
I will not leave you.

453
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,264
Gaurds throw them out.

454
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:04,202
Please don't do this
Leave us leave us.

455
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,205
Your highness! What is all this?

456
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,946
Who do you think they were?

457
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,945
They are the daughters, no
no as good daughters..

458
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,948
...of my master hermit
Vishwamitra.

459
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,450
Vishwamitra's daughters?

460
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,954
Satyakirti! Come on.

461
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,716
Come on!

462
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,098
What? Is it true?

463
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,749
Bramha rushi!

464
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,990
You sinner! Do not
impure my feet

465
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,923
The time of destruction of you
and your kingdom is near.

466
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:04,063
Hermit, I am unable to
understand my mistake.

467
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:09,229
Look how innocent he acts.
He refused to touch me.

468
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:11,204
He droved me away on
holding his hand.

469
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,206
He refused to hug and
pushed me away.

470
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:17,837
Harishchandra! Your kingly
orders will not be obeyed here.

471
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,006
. Without fearing to
my rage and anger..

472
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:22,880
...you have insulted disrespected
my daughters..

473
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:27,021
...you will be cursed
badly by me.

474
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:31,691
Hermit! These girls
misbehaved with me.

475
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:34,026
I just tried to make
them understand.

476
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,864
If this is the reason of your
anger then I am apologizing..

477
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:41,901
...humbly for it. Peacefully
accept it.

478
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,036
All these apologies
and humbleness..

479
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:46,301
...etc is only for your kingdom.

480
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,241
If you want my anger
to become calm..

481
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:55,417
...then you will have
to obey my orders.

482
00:37:56,107 --> 00:38:00,453
I am always ready to obey you
rightfully and religiously.

483
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,653
What is religion and
what is preaching?

484
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,185
Harishchandra, listen
to what I say?

485
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,063
My daughters are in
love with you and..

486
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:11,065
...you will have to get
married somehow.

487
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,064
Hermit, you the preacher
of the religion are..

488
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:17,435
...asking me to go against
the religion?

489
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,200
When I, the maker of this
Religion, insist you to do..

490
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:22,777
...so why have you to bother
about all that?

491
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,272
Your religion is
just to obey me.

492
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:29,144
Gentleman you are the creator
of the discipline.

493
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,945
Is it fair for you to
preach me like this?

494
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:37,156
"Marriage is to grow the
family and the religion"

495
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:41,389
"married to a wife in
the witness of fire"

496
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:46,097
"and taken wows of abiding
by the religious rules"

497
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:51,936
"I will not do this illegal
and against religious deed"

498
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:56,110
Harishchandra, Stop
this nonsense.

499
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,039
I will make you suffer the hell
on this earth if you don't..

500
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,381
...obey me and marry these girls.

501
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,422
What do you say?

502
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:11,154
Hermit! Whatever it is, I will
no go against the religion.

503
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,888
Religion! What is your religion?

504
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:19,060
King's religion is only to obey
the orders of rishi's like us.

505
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:22,133
If this is what is
the religion..

506
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,206
...of the king and
I am ready to..

507
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:27,967
...sacrifice the throne
of the king.

508
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:32,710
What did you say? You will
leave the throne?

509
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,912
Amen! Do as you said.

510
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:40,253
I too had a wish to become
a king since very long.

Who will love me?

Now we no more need you.

528
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:55,228
Your highness, you got rid of
them because you created..

529
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:59,459
...them, but Harishchandra is
the creation of Lord Bramha

530
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,170
Nakshatrikallll!

531
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,293
Queen Queen.

532
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:04,236
The king is coming here.

533
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,384
My child.

534
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:20,014
My lord, have you returned
victoriously?

535
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,984
Now no more victory, madam.

536
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,953
Minister, What kind
of say is this?

537
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:29,832
Dear I am unable to convince
Satyakirti.

538
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,032
May be because he is
affectionate about us.

539
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:37,104
But I am helpless. There
was no other way.

540
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,274
Why what happened my lord?

541
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:42,276
Lady I have donated
the whole of our..

542
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,846
...kingdom to hermit Vishwamitra.

543
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:50,283
I have promised that I will
personally do this deed.

544
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,286
Without having sufficient
time to..

545
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,891
...inform you I had
to do this job.

546
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:00,295
My beloved there isn't
any need to inform me.

547
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,325
There must be definitely
some important reason..

548
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,760
...for which you had take
this decision. Isn't it?

549
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:10,037
Father! Donating the kingdom
is the biggest donation.

00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,607
. True my son true.

551

Did you hear minister
Satyakirti?

552
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:19,908
Why do I need any kingdom or
any other wealth when..

553
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,113
...I have such a good
wife and a son.

"Various boons from
different gods..

563

00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:01,880
Mahendra! There are many who
have donated their kingdoms

570
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,416
but for the protection of
the truth Harishchandra..

571
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:06,749
...is the only one of the
king on this earth.

572
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:11,584
So it is victory to Vashistha
and loss to Vishwamitra.

573
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:17,765
That is only your dream.
Just wait and watch

574
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:22,903
what is preserved
for the future.

575

Harishchandra! At least
now you listen to me.

576
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,750
I will return your kingdom.

577
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,685
Why do you punish your
innocent son and wife

578
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:45,621
who have never experienced
hardships ever?

579
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:49,859
Only because of them that I
have given you this chance.

580
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,459
My lord, we have no hardships
at all please..

581
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,537
...bless us and allow
us to leave.

582
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,936
Do you want my orders or do you
want my blessings you fool..

583
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,542
...your folly will
lead you nowhere.

584
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,473
Just get out of here.

585
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,819

This kingdom is no more
mine. Please take me.

588
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:28,969
Not only you but for
all of us too.

Your highness it is impossible
to stay here without you.

590
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:41,881
Harishchandra! Is this what
you have donated to me?

591
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,613
The hatred of the people
of the kingdom.

592
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,621
This throne, these pillars,
these big rooms, dumping..

593
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:51,587
...all this on my head with all
your ministers and people..

594
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:55,823
...disrespecting me you are
trying to run away?

595
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:58,794
You are trying to take away
the nerves of this kingdom?

596
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,061
You had promised to donate
me everything you possess.

597
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:08,236
Don't insist. Nothing is
destructing me form leaving.

598
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:11,540
Sataykirti, you are the
head of the ministers..

599
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:13,671
...you need to take care
of this henceforth.

600
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,543
My dear ministers, now you
are the caretaker..

601
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:20,588
...of the people of this kingdom.

602
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:23,325
Without you will it be
called as the kingdom?

603
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:28,560
You should not forget your
duties due to the affection.

604
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,567
Maharishi Vishwamitra is
the most respectable..

605
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,569
...for you and for me forever.

606
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,573
It is your fortune that
he is leading..

607
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:40,733
...you as a king to this kingsom.

608
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:44,572
Henceforth your duty is
to obey his orders..

609
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:47,808
...respect him and take
him as your king.

610
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,978
And that will make me happy

611
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,679
Harishchandra! Now
you can leave.

612
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:05,766
My lord my lord my lord My lord.

613
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:24,514
Oh what a dignity, what
a sacrifice my god.

614
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:31,823
"To protect the truth,

615
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:40,462
sacrificing the kingdom,

616
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:53,641
along with his wife &
son is proceeding..

617
00:47:53,771 --> 00:48:02,384
...the King Harishchandra"

618
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:13,368
Your highness, we belong to you.
We all will go with you.

619
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,661
We were all happy under
your protection..

620
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:19,104
...now god knows about
our future.

621
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:23,709
My dear people, you say all this
because of the affection..

622
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:26,712
...you have on me but you are
unaware of the truth.

623
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:30,278
Do you think I will be the
eternal king to this kingdom?

624
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,981
King to this throne will keep
changing one after the other.

625
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:36,823
Many of the kings have ruled
this kingdom earlier.

626
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:42,627
This is your fortune that you
got a king like Vishwamitra.

627
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:46,931
Its your duty to serve and
obey him dutifully.

628
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,371
Its not their duty it
is their destiny.

629
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:53,437
Without you how will we survive
in this kingdom?

630
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:56,835
Dear father, so long you
protected us with all your love

631
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,048
Now you leave us to these
cruel Maharishi?

632
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:03,614
How dare you disrespect me

633
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,015
You will be punished for this.

634
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,014
We all are ready for
the punishment.

635
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,724
Its better to die
than to leave..

636
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:11,326
...with a heartless
king like you.

637
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,451
Burn us down with your curses.

638
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:18,762
In the fit of rage do
not talk rubbish.

639
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,765
Who do you think he is?
He is a Maharishi.

640
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,835
Bramharishi, an idol
to the dignified.

641
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,542
Peace lover compassionate.

642
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,503
No one should disgrace him.

643
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:35,841
Harishchandra enough of these
see offs, tears and preaching.

644
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:41,419
Satya kirti no one
should stop him.

645
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:44,359
Harishchandra now you may leave.

646
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,850
Nakshatrika! See there
Harishchandra.

647
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:19,793
Master now why do we follow
Harishchandra?

648
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,092
He has lost the battle
he lied. Didn't he?

649
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:27,026
Is it when did he lie? It
seems you did not notice.

650
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,569
Didn't he praise you?

651
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:33,965
Don't be angry Maharishi

652
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:35,805
Never mind if he did
not lie for once..

653
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:37,105
...we can get him
done tens times.

654
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:41,606
Harihschandra! Wait! wait! wait!

655
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,915
Is this your commitment?
Is this your promise?

656
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,052
The moment we forgot, you
are trying to cheat us?

657
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,428
Cheating? What have I cheated?

658
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:01,731
The money which I had asked
for, where is it?

659
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,035
It is safely kept in
the royal safe.

660
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:12,543
Don't behave innocent.

661
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,549
You have donated everything..

662
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:19,086
...to me now and now everything
is mine so now..

663
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:24,284
...you will have to separately
repay the money I asked for.

664
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:27,424
Maharishi you are learned and
sensible enough to understand

665
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:30,795
That I have donated everything
to you and now..

666
00:51:31,355 --> 00:51:32,857
...I have nothing to give
you so how will..

667
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,560
...I repay the debt
like this at once?

668
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:38,462
Master now that he has
said no come lets go.

669
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:43,006
No I did not mean that. Give
me one month's time

670
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,771
I will anyhow repay your debt.

671
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,084
How and where will you
earn so much money?

672
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,312
In the land of my lord, Kashi

673
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,290
Within that period you will
have to repay your debt.

674
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,625
Now you may go. -As
you wish Maharishi.

675
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,364
Harishchandra wait a minute

676
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,405
I have one idea of collecting..

677
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,506
...my money without you coming
back to this land.

678
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,971
I will send my disciple
Nakshatrika with you.

679
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:21,039
Hand over my money to my
disciple he will reach it to me.

680
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:27,353
Me being his first disciple
he has honored me with it.

681
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:32,522
Come on come on lets go Or
else rahukalam will start.

682
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:37,463
Nakshatrika!

683
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,802
Did you call me? Somehow I
see some bad signs ahead.

684
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:47,707
. It looks like he will
definitely repay the debt.

685
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:52,511
Nakshatrika our aim is not to
get our debt paid but to..

686
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:55,807
...divert him from his truth.

687
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,851
Time and again you must..

688
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,249
...put some obstacles in between
so that he should..

689
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:07,589
...not be able to repay our debt.

690
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:12,795
0k now I got it Master. I will
do my duties. Bless me

691
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,263
You are blessed.

692
00:53:29,106 --> 00:53:37,082
"What kind of a fate is this?
What a plight of life is this?

693
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:46,027
What are my misdeeds for which
you have punished me.

694
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:53,267
"What kind of a fate
is this? Oh! Horn!

695
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,590
Tiger ! Tiger ! Tiger !

696
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:34,208
I lived so happily and
peacefully in the heritage.

697
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:38,042
And now I am wondering
in this hot sun..

698
00:54:38,175 --> 00:54:42,646
...sweating and burning.
What a life.

699
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:59,604
"What kind of a fate is this?
What a plight of life is this?

700
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,586
Snake! Snake! Snake!

701
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:28,770
"What kind of a fate is this?
What a plight of life is this?

702
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:38,247
What are my misdeeds for which
you have punished me.

703
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:42,407
"What kind of a fate is this?

704
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,847
Nakshatreshwara!

705
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,528
Nakshatreshwara!

706
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:31,891
Nakshatreshwara!

707
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:40,306
Thirst, hunger, oh my god
I am dying. Oh god.

708
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,475
Fire fire

709
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,375
What happened? What
else will happen?

710
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:49,473
My mouth is drying. My
stomach is sinking.

711
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:55,622
Oh god only because of your debt
I am into this trouble.

712
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:59,353
Master please see what
have you put me into.

713
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:02,259
I am dying out of hunger
and thirst.

714
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:04,491
Your debt will bring me death.

715
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:07,602
Master take my death
as your fees.

716
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:11,267
This place seems to be
like a crematory.

717
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:12,999
I cannot see any water around.

718
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:18,641
Harishchandra I know why
are you saying this?

719
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:21,472
Even if you find some water
you will not bring it.

720
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:26,350
I am dependent up on you and
once I am dead there will..

721
00:57:26,477 --> 00:57:29,890
...be one to ask you for debt.
That is what your trick is.

722
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,452
Due to hunger you are
talking all rubbish.

723
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:36,220
Just be patient I
will definitely..

724
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:38,492
...search for some water for you.

725
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:42,531
Lady you take care of him.

726
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,701
Mother!

727
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:51,336
What dear? -I too am
thirsty mother.

728
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:54,239
Be a little patient dear.
Your father has..

729
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:57,011
...gone to bring water.
Please be patient.

730
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:01,956
Lady I am dying. I am dying.

731
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,323
But before I die I would like
to do some good deed.

732
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,895
Please tell me what is it?

733
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,991
You are a very good lady.

734
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:12,757
You are unable to see
others in agony.

735
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,669
Tell me I will take care of it.

736
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:19,999
Oh I am not talking about me but
just turn to your side and..

737
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:21,907
...just look at your son.

738
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:26,481
He is suppose to be sitting
on the throne,

739
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,276
it is very difficult to
see him suffering..

740
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:31,147
...like this in this
deserted forest.

741
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:36,218
So now to drive away
his hardships..

742
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:39,585
...you will have to find
some solution isn't it?

743
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,888
Our duty is to just face
whatever is destined to us.

744
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,997
Who are we to go out of
the way and change it?

745
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,935
God is there to save us.

746
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:53,374
Though he is there I don't see
him doing anything for you.

747
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:57,805
Now it your husband who has
to repay my master's debt.

748
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:01,507
It is neither you nor your son.
Then why do you suffer?

749
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,778
Nakshatreshwara! -Here comes
the devoted wife's anger.

750
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,320
Duty of a devoted wife
is not just..

751
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:09,754
...to be blind and
follow as he says

752
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,919
but to see to it that without
doing any wrong

753
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,897
deeds you have to proceed
and find a solution.

754
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:21,696
Nakshatreshwara! You
talk senseless.

755
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,405
Why do you take so much pains
in such a condition?

756
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:30,611
Oh god fire, fire in my stomach

757
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,340
Thirst! Some one give
me some thing..

758
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,542
...to stop this fire.
Anything please.

759
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:39,586
Lohita! Please see him
I will come now.

760
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:52,292
Dear child, Lohita What
are you doing?

761
00:59:52,723 --> 00:59:59,766
Just dozing off. -You
silly boy, very bold.

762
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:03,870
Oh so you to are his son so you
are telling me the truth.

763
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:08,716
Come come come near me And sit.

764
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:15,580
My honey, my goldie, my sweety.

765
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,885
Look at you how tired you are.

766
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:22,423
Dear child Lohita, will
you obey as I say?

767
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,563
You come with me to Ayodhya..

768
01:00:25,689 --> 01:00:27,862
...my master will give
you the kingdom.

769
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:30,904
Searching for you your parents
will also come there.

770
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:33,235
Then automatically you will
be out of this hardships.

771
01:00:33,564 --> 01:00:37,740
I am a learned person
and preaching you.

772
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:40,439
Did you understand?
How is my solution?

773
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:43,810
Your solution is just
like a problem.

774
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:46,821
Sir have you finished
preaching me?

775
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:49,719
Oh so you too try to act smart?

776
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,416
Come on massage my leg.

777
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:52,422
Why disobey me? Come
on you mother..

778
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:54,256
...has asked you to
take care of me.

779
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,522
Massage my leg.

780
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,997
Hey will you break my leg?
Massage it properly.

781
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:44,912
Go in Vashishtha's disguise to
Harishchandra and deceive him

782
01:01:58,382 --> 01:01:59,486
Now come on lets move
or else one more..

783
01:01:59,616 --> 01:02:01,323
...Vishwamitra will
be visiting us.

784
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,658
One more Vishwamitra?
Don't you understand?

785
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,331
Who has created this
place like this?

786
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:09,801
Only Vishwamitra. Come
on lets go from here..

787
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,108
...before that Vishwamitra
lands up here.

788
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:20,213
Harishchandra! My disciple!

789
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:26,217
Welcome master. Long live.

790
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,821
Harishchandra!Why do you
look at me like this?

791
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:34,589
I have seen the fraud
Vishwamitra has done to you.

792
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:40,631
I will defeat him in no time and
will get back your kingdom.

793
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,533
Master is it you who
are saying this?

794
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:48,938
I have donated my kingdom to
Vishwamitra with a very big..

795
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:52,640
...heart how can I take
it back? Is it fair?

796
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:57,775
Then do one thing. You come
with me to my hermitage.

797
01:02:57,908 --> 01:03:02,482
I am greatful to all your
respect and affection

798
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:06,158
but I need to repay
Vishwamitra's debt.

799
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:13,360
Debt? Yes now I recollect.
But isn't it too much?

800
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:16,795
Don't worry I will give
you one Mantra.

801
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,570
If you chant it for a
lake of a time it..

802
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:22,404
...will get you as much
money as you want.

803
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:25,138
Take that money and throw
it on his face.

804
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:29,182
Looking at his preaching,
talking and all his solutions..

805
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,281
...I feel he is some
devil in disguise.

806
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,186
He is not our Vashishtha.
Hold him and thrash him..

807
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,721
...with in no time the truth will

808
01:03:34,845 --> 01:03:35,846
come out. Come on hold him.

809
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:38,983
He disciple. Hey tell
me who are you?

810
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:45,922
Oh my god! Didn't I tell you
some kind of Vishwamitra..

811
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,530
...will be here at any time, did
you see by yourself now.

812
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:51,172
Now come on come on lets
go out of here come on.

813
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:10,280
Oh mother! I am unable to
walk. What happened?

814
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,757
I don't know what's
wrong with my leg.

815
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:15,227
Why the hell did we
come that way.

816
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:19,092
Definitely I will die
in this forest.

817
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:20,394
Harishchandra!

818
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:22,903
Forgive us oh lord.

819
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,935
Please sit on my shoulder
I will carry you.

820
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:28,639
What? you will carry
me on your shoulder?

821
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:33,674
0k ok come on carry
me on you shoulder.

822
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,761
Harishchandra! Some firelike
thing is coming this side

823
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,796
What is it Nakshatreshwara?
Lets go this side.

824
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:53,765
Here too I can see the same
This side this side

825
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,399
Lets go this side.

826
01:04:58,962 --> 01:05:01,943
I can see fire everywhere.

827
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:09,480
Please put me down.

828
01:05:14,444 --> 01:05:17,220
This doesn't look like
any ordinary fire.

829
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:19,224
This is some kind of
a magical misdeed.

830
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:24,128
Your highness you are scaring
me more with your talk.

831
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,824
Please search for some solution.

832
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:30,597
There is a solution for this.
Did you hear your highness?

833
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,707
Fire god is himself
speaking to you.

834
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:37,334
He is suggesting a solution.

835
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:47,382
You have to enter this fire,
bluffing me with your real name.

836
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,187
Is it all? I will do
it in a minute.

837
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:52,725
Then I am not Vishwamitra's
disciple..

838
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:55,261
...and my name is
not Nakshatrika.

839
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:57,657
On the whole I am not
a human being.

840
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:21,915
Did you see how have I escaped
this fire by just not..

841
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:26,217
...telling my real name? this
is my masters miracle.

842
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:28,625
You too just do the same and
lets get out of this fire.

843
01:06:28,919 --> 01:06:32,196
It is not so easy the way you
say it Nakshatreshwara.

844
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:36,566
What's wrong in lying about your
name in such a a situation?

845
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,204
Were you born with a name
from your mother's womb?

846
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,400
Why are you so adamant oh king?

847
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,602
Come on make it fast lets
get out of here.

Hey mister, why are you sitting
quiet? What is the decision?

902
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:18,427
You promised to repay the
debt within one month, ..

903
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,033
...what happened to
the commitment?

904
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:25,271
Tomorrow is the last day How
will you repay so fast?

905
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,104
I too am worried about the same.

906
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:34,111
Me who deceives others,today you
are trying to deceive me?

907
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:38,117
Have you forgotten that early
morning the elephant, ..

01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:40,653

01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:45,156
Thousand gold coins. One
Thousand gold coins. Two

910
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:48,021
Listen to my advice silly king

911
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:50,495
Which will save both of us.

912
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:54,701
To pay my master was
your commitment

913
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,269
but he did not give
it to you as..

914
01:14:56,392 --> 01:14:59,066
...a loan. Do you agree? Say yes.

915
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:02,540
There is no witness for this.

916
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:06,703
So just deny the commitment.

917
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:13,314
Nakshatreshwara, is it what
a hermit like you preaches?

918
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,290
Its your wish now. Repay
your debt as you wish.

919
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,460
I will take you to the king
of Kashipura and create a..

920
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:23,223
...havoc and I will tell him that
you are a cheater and lier.

921
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,491
I am the disciple of my master.
I am Nakshatrika.

922
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:29,569
Our debt our debt our debt

923
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:38,044
My lord. Can I suggest you
something? -Yes what is it?

924
01:15:38,401 --> 01:15:44,647
Our treasure is you are for
me and I am for you.

925
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:49,781
Thus there is only one
way to repay our debt.

926
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:52,218
Keeping aside all the affection
you have for me..

927
01:15:53,316 --> 01:16:00,200
...sell me off as a slave
to some rich trader.

928
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:08,004
Lady what kind of a suggestion
are you giving me?

929
01:16:08,798 --> 01:16:12,405
You whom I worshiped like
my beloved soul,

930
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:17,343
my other half my whole and
sole I must sell me.

931
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,247
Sell you off?

932
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:24,351
Every deed is pure
and is never low..

933
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,154
...which is done to
save the truth.

934
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:31,793
Lady! -My lord there
is no other..

935
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:35,167
...better solution for the
situation we are in.

936
01:16:36,059 --> 01:16:38,801
Yes my lady there
is no other way.

937
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:43,369
I accept your suggestion.

938
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:50,183
But but before that I will..

939
01:16:50,306 --> 01:16:51,785
I will sell off myself.

940
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:53,551
I will sell myself.

941
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:57,453
Nakshatreshwara come on.
-Dear king! Oh King.

942
01:16:58,147 --> 01:17:00,388
You do not have the knack of
do that kind of business.

943
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:03,720
You are the eldest in the
family. If you will first sell..

944
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:05,389
...yourself then they
will take away..

945
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:06,966
...your wife and son for free.

946
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:09,261
Understand? There will
be no one to..

947
01:17:09,392 --> 01:17:13,431
...collect the money on your
behalf and you will be unable..

948
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:18,202
...to repay my debt.
Isn't it mister?

949
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,236
Nakshatreshwara!

950
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:27,019
My lord the sage is your well
wisher and has made aware.

951
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:32,225
If you remain independent you
can earn money repay the..

952
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:34,954
...debt and bail us out.

953
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:37,420
So oh lady you are
trying to keep..

954
01:17:37,553 --> 01:17:39,226
...me away from this attachment.

955
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,566
0k ask you wish my
wife as you wish.

956
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,662
I will do as you wish.

Nakshtreshwara! I will make
myself stone hearted

958
01:17:54,704 --> 01:17:57,241
and get ready to sell my wife.

959
01:17:57,607 --> 01:17:58,711
Come on lets go.

960
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:02,213
He has gone crazy. Given
nectar to the insane..

961
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,721
...he vomited considering
it as poison.

962
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,458
That's what has happened
now. Why..

963
01:18:05,581 --> 01:18:07,151
...will you listen to my advice?

964
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:09,126
Obey your wife. You

...these shining ear rings.
A rod in the hand.

975
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:02,446
You look exactly like
a great preacher.

976
01:19:02,638 --> 01:19:06,279
This preacher Kalakoshika, if

977
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:09,981
...disciples on then people will
stare at us and get scared.

You rubbish speaker!

What do you think of me, the one
who is scared of his wife?

983
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:33,042
No you just shiver.
-Just shut up.

984
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:35,206
One must never show
off to one's wife.

985
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:36,543
But come on say..

986
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:41,418

"To give a false and defective

01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:06,075
"And then give them some
solution on it."

992
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:10,576
"To do some kind of
magics and solve..

993
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:14,153
...the problems for
handsome fees."

994
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:19,585
"Who is the one who proudly

...has not taken birth as yet."

"To make people believe what is
unbelievable and deceive..

And by cheating people..

Who is the one who proudly
walks in front..

1003
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:58,129
...of lord Kaushik. Tell
me who is he?"

1004
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,132
"Who is he? Tell me who is he?"

"Who is he? Who is he? Who is
he? Who is he? Who is he?"

1012
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:29,556
Stop. What is all this?

1013
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:32,498
Is this the house
or the theatre?

1014
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:34,601
You all are behaving
like lunatics.

1015
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,663
What kind of disguise is this?

1016
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:38,970
What's wrong with you to day?

1017
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:42,564
I will tell you. Now onwards
I will not do this job.

1018
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:46,041
I will not take the burden of
others and will not eat twice.

1019
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:50,308
Then how will we make a living
if you sit at home jobless?

1020
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:52,680
If I walk down the street
with this disguise..

1021
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:58,091
...people will think
me to be a priest..

1022
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:01,057
...and will honor me
by with a garland..

1023
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:03,390
...and offer a plate
full of gold coins.

1024
01:22:03,552 --> 01:22:05,554
And when they come to
know the truth..

1025
01:22:05,688 --> 01:22:08,965
...they will break your teeth
and send you home.

1026
01:22:09,191 --> 01:22:14,163
Forget that and get on with
your real profession..

1027
01:22:14,797 --> 01:22:19,644
...and earn as much as you can.

1028
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:22,241
And if you come home
empty handed..

1029
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:25,950
...you know me very well.

1030
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:29,255
Hey Bhatta, you too go with him.

1031
01:22:30,246 --> 01:22:32,419
Master! Don't stare
his face I say go.

1032
01:22:32,648 --> 01:22:37,597
Hey bhatta sharma juttu
where are you all?

1033
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:43,165
Hey lord what a great sin I have
done in my last birth..

1034
01:22:43,526 --> 01:22:46,234
...that you have given
me such wife?

1035
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:49,735
She is a pain in my neck In this
life let me serve her well

1036
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:53,303
so that I get good wife
in my next life.

1037
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,278
Help me oh lord.

1038
01:22:56,872 --> 01:23:01,048
Dear, for me, who has set myself
to do such a sinful deed

1039
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:04,614
...the world is like a dark hell.

1040
01:23:05,948 --> 01:23:07,950
How will I sell you?

1041
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:12,224
Oh god ! I am simply clueless

1042
01:23:12,755 --> 01:23:14,928
My lord! Don't hesitate.

1043
01:23:15,524 --> 01:23:19,597
Just do it the way
any king would.

1044
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,271
He will hardly understand
that way.

1045
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:24,802
Let me teach you business.

1046
01:23:24,934 --> 01:23:28,472
To get the maximum profit just
start boosting the rates as..

1047
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:32,142
...they are done during auction.

1048
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:35,020
Will it not be a sin
Nakshatreshwara to display..

1049
01:23:35,144 --> 01:23:37,249
...unpossessed qualities?.

1050
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:42,855
Sheer madness of being truthful.
Then do as you wish.

1051
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,526
Hey the residents of Kashipur,

1052
01:23:46,655 --> 01:23:48,896
Please listen to the plead
of this popper.

1053
01:23:49,892 --> 01:23:52,236
This Sadhhimani is my wife,.

1054
01:23:52,795 --> 01:23:54,900
<i>...possess all the
good qualities.</i>

1055
01:23:55,597 --> 01:24:02,071
"In the dreams, in the thoughts,
always in the smile..

1056
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:07,748
With all the incomparable
qualities..

1057
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:16,491
...the one who treats
everyone equally..

1058
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:20,996
...and obedient to everyone and..

1059
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:27,263
...forgetting that
she is a queen..

1060
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:36,039
...she will serve her masters."

1061
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:45,785
"An obediently serving
humble maid."

1062
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:48,517
"She's a helpless
mother who has..

1063
01:24:48,651 --> 01:24:51,791
...nothing to offer
her children."

1064
01:24:52,054 --> 01:24:56,696
"A very soft hearted and
considering me as her god."

1065
01:24:56,892 --> 01:25:02,001
"A saintly soul my other half."

1066
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:09,113
"Now parting with my one part..

1067
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:14,238
And selling it, selling it."

1068
01:25:24,019 --> 01:25:28,468
Dear people, before I become a
sinner and before I loose..

1069
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:31,597
...my senses please be good
and somebody buy this..

1070
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:40,610
...pure soul and make yourself
fortunate, be fortunate.

1071
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:43,439
Hey! Just unable to see this.

1072
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:47,752
It will be a sin to separate
a couple like this.

1073
01:25:48,911 --> 01:25:50,151
Yes, who will?

1074
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:53,489
Come on!

1075
01:26:07,696 --> 01:26:10,506
Oh! All are going away.

1076
01:26:11,734 --> 01:26:14,180
Isn't there any fortunate
who can buy me?

1077
01:26:15,571 --> 01:26:17,983
Aren't we so fortunate
enough to repay?

1078
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,978
Oh Lord! Kashi Vishweshwara.

1079
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:30,622
"Now is the end of the truth..

1080
01:26:30,786 --> 01:26:35,997
...and in such time only
you are the protector."

1081
01:26:36,258 --> 01:26:39,728
"Oh L0rd..

1082
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:44,208
...please send a rich buyer..

1083
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:54,045
...who can buy this humble
maid. Please bless us."

1084
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:20,445
Hey almighty all your favour.

1085
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:23,812
Hey Vatslya you have over eaten
and yet thinking of..

1086
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:27,079
...eating two more times, how
have you survived like this?

1087
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:33,054
Hey dumb head. Look at this
medicine, the moment you..

1088
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:36,993
...put it on your tounge the
food gets digested there.

1089
01:27:37,286 --> 01:27:41,200
Hey your boundary is that side,
how is that you are here?

1090
01:27:41,323 --> 01:27:45,465
That lane comes only when I
cross this vegetable market.

1091
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,904
I will go and buy some
vegetables for madam..

1092
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:50,533
...you take your own time.

1093
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:54,080
Time and again you take
your madam's side..

1094
01:27:54,203 --> 01:27:59,243
...you better know she is
my wife too. Silly.

1095
01:28:16,692 --> 01:28:20,435
Dear people today before
sunset I need to repay..

1096
01:28:20,729 --> 01:28:25,041
...Vishwamitra Rushi, please
some one be kind enough..

1097
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:27,545
...and buy this maid.

1098
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:31,774
Hey it useless just yelling
at the top of your voice.

1099
01:28:31,907 --> 01:28:35,116
The people of Kashipura
are rich enough.

1100
01:28:35,244 --> 01:28:36,917
Even if the whole of Kashipura
collects their wealth, they..

1101
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:39,491
...will not be able to help
you pay your debt.

1102
01:28:39,748 --> 01:28:43,059
Neither will the king of
Kashipur nor will the god..

1103
01:28:43,185 --> 01:28:46,598
...be able to repay your debt

1104
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:48,768
What the hell did you
say? You duffer!

1105
01:28:49,024 --> 01:28:52,904
...you abuse me in my own area?
Tell me, how much..

1106
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:58,975
...money do you want.
Just tell me.

1107
01:28:59,101 --> 01:29:03,106
Master I can see some
bad signs. 0k !

1108
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:06,382
So you are trying to
make your wife..

1109
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:07,782
...happy by buying a maid for her

1110
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:13,823
Come on buy. Come on buy This
whole village is yours.

1111
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:17,163
Hey you, my master is asking
you how much do you want?

1112
01:29:17,586 --> 01:29:21,159
A Stone when thrown by a mighty
fighter standing..

1113
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:25,032
...on top of the tallest
mountain goes as much..

1114
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:30,803
...tall, that much tall pile
of golden coins he needs.

1115
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:32,611
Will you be able to give?

1116
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:37,444
Hey you keep demanding as
your twisted boneless ..

1117
01:29:37,573 --> 01:29:39,712
...tongue gets twisted.

1118
01:29:39,942 --> 01:29:41,444
Hey let him demand never mind.

1119
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,817
That's fine. We will pay him
as much as he demanded but..

1120
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:45,583
...but how will he carry it home?

1121
01:29:46,515 --> 01:29:46,822
Never mind if they
will not be able..

1122
01:29:46,949 --> 01:29:48,826
...to carry it we ill deliver..

1123
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:50,486
...it on an elephant.

1124
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:54,829
It seem that today you
are ready to anything.

1125
01:29:55,624 --> 01:29:57,626
A thorn has to be removed
by a thorn.

1126
01:29:57,759 --> 01:29:59,705
...iron has to be cut
by only iron.

1127
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:03,838
So that Vishwamitra has sent
this person with you to..

1128
01:30:03,999 --> 01:30:07,071
...collect his money?-Yes
my lord.

1129
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:09,846
Harishchandra I am very
happy to see..

1130
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:12,474
...your loyalty and faithfulness.

1131
01:30:12,974 --> 01:30:17,548
Any ways I have an opportunity
to help a person like you.

1132
01:30:18,113 --> 01:30:19,854
Please don't sell your wife..

1133
01:30:20,015 --> 01:30:23,588
...I will donate you as much
money as you need.

1134
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:26,659
You can repay you debt
with that money.

1135
01:30:27,055 --> 01:30:29,535
Sir I am a warrior

1136
01:30:30,192 --> 01:30:32,035
I don't have the right
to receive anything

1137
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:35,172
I only have the right to donate.

1138
01:30:35,864 --> 01:30:42,042
0k so what I have to do is to
buy your wife as a maid.

1139
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,510
Will that be alright?

1140
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,520
Be blessed and successful.

1141
01:30:54,049 --> 01:30:56,893
That's all fine but gentleman
I hope you are into a right..

1142
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:59,426
...legal business. Are you sure?

1143
01:30:59,755 --> 01:31:01,735
No misleading?

1144
01:31:01,857 --> 01:31:03,803
Hey you ill fated!

1145
01:31:04,059 --> 01:31:07,165
If I deceive the whole
world get ruined

1146
01:31:08,597 --> 01:31:12,010
Hey don't go so far just tell me
what about our payment part..

1147
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:18,615
The King of Kashipura takes
care of all my receivables.

1148
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:20,850
Just show him this
diamond ring and..

1149
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:22,216
...you will receive
all your money.

1150
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:27,956
Oh so if I show this ring all
your secrets will be out?

1151
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:31,961
Yes! Hey Harishchandra.

1152
01:31:32,554 --> 01:31:36,229
You will not leave this
place and go..

1153
01:31:36,525 --> 01:31:39,165
...anywhere unless I inform you
about the receipt of money

1154
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:48,203
So gentleman, now that we are
related to each other..

1155
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:53,179
...due to this give and take
business and that since so..

1156
01:31:53,475 --> 01:31:54,818
...many days I have had no good
food I would like to..

1157
01:31:55,077 --> 01:31:57,887
...come to your house and have
a stomach full of good..

1158
01:31:58,013 --> 01:32:02,962
...food before I could leave this
town. You will definitely..

1159
01:32:03,118 --> 01:32:05,894
...have to do all this for me.

1160
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:11,536
Aha! Aha! Whatever has to
reach you must reach you.

1161
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:13,970
0k then I will take your
leave. See you soon.

1162
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:22,209
Master! Madam will be very happy
to know that a queen..

1163
01:32:22,504 --> 01:32:25,417
...will be working as a maid for
her. I will take her there.

1164
01:32:25,674 --> 01:32:27,153
Hey maid come on with me.

1165
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:31,024
My lord! -Yes.

1166
01:32:32,147 --> 01:32:36,926
As henceforth I will be unable
to stay and serve..

1167
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:38,630
...you the unfortunate time
of separation has come.

1168
01:32:40,522 --> 01:32:43,867
Whole heartedly kindly
permit me to leave.

1169
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,568
My dear..

1170
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:53,703
...to you who lived in a palace
has been is whole heartedly..

1171
01:32:54,736 --> 01:32:56,545
...been permitted the moment
you were sold.

1172
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:01,444
Now this world for me will
be like a big zero.

1173
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:04,751
Silent and dark.

1174
01:33:06,815 --> 01:33:07,885
My lord

1175
01:33:09,517 --> 01:33:13,897
I am unable to see you
helpless like this.

1176
01:33:15,991 --> 01:33:18,528
Hey! We have bought her to
make ourselves fell good.

1177
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,901
By crying like this you are
making us simply unhappy.

1178
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:24,101
Hey maid come on lots of
work is pending at home.

1179
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:27,641
My dear..

1180
01:33:29,471 --> 01:33:32,418
You have no experience
of serving anybody.

1181
01:33:33,742 --> 01:33:35,050
So I am telling you..

1182
01:33:36,478 --> 01:33:38,424
That never in your
dreams must you..

1183
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:40,423
...think about those old days.

1184
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:43,959
Just think that you were
born like this..

1185
01:33:44,519 --> 01:33:47,693
...and be good to everyone
and live peacefully.

1186
01:33:49,558 --> 01:33:52,903
There you will have
no one of your own.

1187
01:33:54,396 --> 01:33:55,602
How will you be..

1188
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:59,976
...able to survive all
alone god knows.

1189
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:02,740
Hey Lord!

1190
01:34:05,941 --> 01:34:11,687
Master you bought only this
maid and not this child.

1191
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:13,451
Tell them we don't
want this child

1192
01:34:14,449 --> 01:34:17,089
Sir, a child cannot
stay without..

1193
01:34:17,953 --> 01:34:19,990
...a mother please do
not separate them.

1194
01:34:20,789 --> 01:34:24,794
Hey its just a small child
never mind take him too.

1195
01:34:25,093 --> 01:34:27,972
That's a good idea I too
will have one follower.

1196
01:34:28,463 --> 01:34:29,771
Hey maid, come on follow me.

1197
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:36,772
Hey, what are you still waiting
for? I say, come on.

1198
01:34:37,205 --> 01:34:40,778
Hey you who are you? Are
you trying to scare us?

1199
01:34:40,909 --> 01:34:43,617
Though a maid's son you
have lots of guts.

1200
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:45,453
Father!

1201
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:49,186
My son.

1202
01:34:50,919 --> 01:34:54,628
God knows what has store
for you in future.

1203
01:34:57,259 --> 01:35:00,900
You the heir of the throne of
Ayodhya, be cool and patient.

1204
01:35:01,763 --> 01:35:04,710
Tolerate patiently whatever
comes across.

1205
01:35:05,266 --> 01:35:11,842
Now I will not be able to
protect you. No my son.

1206
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:21,183
Sir please treat him like
your son and protect him.

1207
01:35:21,483 --> 01:35:22,962
This is my only humble request.

1208
01:35:27,822 --> 01:35:28,892
My Lord!

1209
01:35:33,528 --> 01:35:35,633
Be patient! Be Patient.

1210
01:35:36,965 --> 01:35:38,876
Kashiwishwanath will
take care of you.

1211
01:35:39,534 --> 01:35:43,448
I am unable to see this
sight. I am going.

1212
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:44,948
You get them with you.

1213
01:35:47,509 --> 01:35:52,583
Hey Granny come lets go.

1214
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:21,787
What? Has my husband done this?

1215
01:36:22,077 --> 01:36:24,455
Tell me the truth or else I
will snatch out your eyes.

1216
01:36:24,579 --> 01:36:28,026
No Madam I thought you will be
happy to hear about this.

1217
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:29,651
But instead you are scolding me.

1218
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:31,957
You see by yourself. He himself
is getting her here.

1219
01:36:32,087 --> 01:36:34,897
What? He himself is
getting her here?

1220
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:38,629
Let them come here I will
teach them a lesson.

1221
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:42,939
Here they come. Master is
here. Master is here.

1222
01:36:43,064 --> 01:36:45,066
Hey you shut up. So
they are here huh!?

1223
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,838
You came? Come on in come on in.

1224
01:36:47,535 --> 01:36:50,846
How dare you do this when
I am still alive?

1225
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,417
Look at you face.

1226
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:00,053
Why are you looking
at me like this?

1227
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:02,559
Listen to me patiently.

1228
01:37:02,684 --> 01:37:05,062
Whole day you slog all alone,..

1229
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:08,099
So I bought this maid
for you to help.

1230
01:37:08,223 --> 01:37:11,136
What? Did you buy
this maid for me?

1231
01:37:11,793 --> 01:37:14,273
I don't know why
but looking at..

1232
01:37:14,396 --> 01:37:16,637
...you I feel like
worshiping you.

1233
01:37:16,965 --> 01:37:19,605
You all just wait here I will
remove the bad air out.

1234
01:37:19,868 --> 01:37:22,815
Gundambhatta?

1235
01:37:23,138 --> 01:37:27,052
Hey you get a coconut and
I will get a lamp.

1236
01:37:27,609 --> 01:37:30,089
Hey maid why are you still
standing there?

1237
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:32,885
Come on in I will
allot you work.

1238
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:36,158
Hey maid come this side I
will show you the room.

1239
01:38:02,677 --> 01:38:06,625
Where the hell has everyone gone
keeping the doors open?

1240
01:38:06,915 --> 01:38:09,987
It seems no one stays
in this house.

1241
01:38:10,118 --> 01:38:12,530
Kalaha! Hey Kalaha!

1242
01:38:12,854 --> 01:38:16,825
Oh ho ho! Your corrupt mind
doesn't leave you.

1243
01:38:17,091 --> 01:38:19,901
Without even waiting till I come
you have just entered in.

1244
01:38:20,628 --> 01:38:24,599
Why do I need a welcome
ceremony? Am I so privileged?

1245
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:28,145
Yes. That's the reason
I went inside.

1246
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:33,350
Forget everything, tell me what
made you change so much?

1247
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:34,680
What type of change dear?

1248
01:38:34,809 --> 01:38:39,189
Looking at my hardship, you
bought a maid for me.

1249
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,585
Tell me everything about it.
Where did you buy her and..

1250
01:38:41,716 --> 01:38:42,751
...for how much did you buy her.
Tell me the whole story.

1251
01:38:43,017 --> 01:38:46,760
A maid? Did I buy a maid?

1252
01:38:47,455 --> 01:38:49,765
Are you in your senses or..

1253
01:38:50,024 --> 01:38:52,630
...or you are just
out of your mind?

1254
01:38:52,894 --> 01:38:55,534
Did I buy a maid?

1255
01:38:55,663 --> 01:38:58,143
May god help. Why ask me?

1256
01:38:58,533 --> 01:39:01,514
You brought her home.

1257
01:39:02,003 --> 01:39:04,074
0k so I bought a maid.

1258
01:39:04,839 --> 01:39:06,750
I brought her home. -Yes.

1259
01:39:06,875 --> 01:39:10,516
I have sent her inside. Now she
is right there isn't it?

1260
01:39:10,645 --> 01:39:14,752
Yes! Yes! Yes! Look at
that maid you bought.

1261
01:39:15,016 --> 01:39:16,962
Hey Maid come on speak up.

1262
01:39:17,085 --> 01:39:18,723
Tell him the truth.
Didn't he buy you?

1263
01:39:19,087 --> 01:39:23,467
Yes Madam he has agreed
to keep my son as well.

1264
01:39:25,493 --> 01:39:30,841
My dear lady. You seem to
come from a good family.

1265
01:39:31,232 --> 01:39:34,736
My heart insists me to
believe What you say..

1266
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:38,640
...but I don't know who are you,
which place you are from,

1267
01:39:38,773 --> 01:39:41,686
...what is your name. I am simply
unable to understand.

1268
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:43,584
I hope the almighty is the
witness for all this.

1269
01:39:43,712 --> 01:39:47,057
Master why do you pretend
and involve the almighty?

1270
01:39:47,182 --> 01:39:48,525
Have you forgotten..

1271
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:51,823
That she is King Harishchandra's
wife..

1272
01:39:51,953 --> 01:39:53,193
...queen Chandravati.

1273
01:39:54,222 --> 01:39:57,795
What? King Harishchandra's wife
queen Chandravati? -Yes.

1274
01:39:59,995 --> 01:40:02,305
Your highness.

1275
01:40:02,897 --> 01:40:05,776
You have blessed my house
by just coming here.

1276
01:40:06,567 --> 01:40:08,911
Your highness, Please bless me.

1277
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:11,776
Oh my god. Help me please.

1278
01:40:12,073 --> 01:40:14,349
So has the story reached here

1279
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:16,612
Why do you take blessing
of a maid?

1280
01:40:16,744 --> 01:40:20,055
Hey Maid! Are you not
ashamed of yourself?

1281
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:23,060
Come on go inside. Hey
Bhatta! Go and get..

1282
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:25,630
...the family exorcist we need
to get your master treated.

1283
01:40:25,753 --> 01:40:29,530
Hey Gundabhatta you go and get
the broker who sold her to me.

1284
01:40:29,657 --> 01:40:32,661
Let him decide who
has gone crazy.

1285
01:40:32,794 --> 01:40:36,173
Why so? You have gone crazy.

1286
01:40:36,464 --> 01:40:38,808
The more we will delay the more
will the madness grow.

1287
01:40:38,933 --> 01:40:41,413
Hey all of you. Come on hold
him and take him inside..

1288
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:43,140
First let us treat him with
some home remedies.

1289
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:49,147
Hey, you're going to treat me?

1290
01:40:51,179 --> 01:40:53,682
Hey you silly. Hey
hold him tight.

1291
01:40:53,815 --> 01:40:55,158
LGBVG me!

1292
01:40:55,817 --> 01:40:56,852
LGBVG me!

1293
01:41:15,036 --> 01:41:16,447
Your highness, Harishchandra,

1294
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:20,511
You have repaid the debt of
my master Vishwamitra.

1295
01:41:20,841 --> 01:41:22,843
Now my yours?

1296
01:41:23,111 --> 01:41:25,523
Which is yours Nakshtreshwara?

1297
01:41:25,747 --> 01:41:26,725
My commission!

1298
01:41:29,016 --> 01:41:30,927
You came here for your master's
work and for that..

1299
01:41:31,485 --> 01:41:33,465
...I will have to pay separately?

1300
01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:35,757
Have I to tell you
this separately?

1301
01:41:36,057 --> 01:41:38,663
You are the king of generosity.

1302
01:41:38,893 --> 01:41:40,395
Just go ahead and donate.

1303
01:41:40,595 --> 01:41:43,439
I never thought you would
do this to me.

1304
01:41:43,965 --> 01:41:50,382
You very well know how much
efforts I have put into this.

1305
01:41:50,638 --> 01:41:54,051
Forgetting all this you are
refusing to pay my commission

1306
01:41:54,175 --> 01:41:55,950
Is this justice, culture, truth?

1307
01:41:56,444 --> 01:41:58,446
Just tell me that you don't
want to give me..

1308
01:41:58,680 --> 01:41:59,715
Anything that's more than
enough. I am going. Forget it.

1309
01:41:59,914 --> 01:42:01,325
Don't get angry, please
don't get angry.

1310
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:07,099
For what have I sold my wife
as a maid and still alive?

1311
01:42:08,723 --> 01:42:13,604
0k then sell me too as a slave
to someone to repay your debt

1312
01:42:13,728 --> 01:42:15,469
Oh Lord! No. No.

1313
01:42:15,763 --> 01:42:19,142
You genuinely are generous.

1314
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:22,614
You are like a richest king come
on lets see if anyone..

1315
01:42:22,837 --> 01:42:23,838
...is willing to buy you.

1316
01:42:24,672 --> 01:42:25,616
This is terrible.

1317
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:38,522

lowest cast? Oh crazy"

1318

...castes, techniques
and wellbeing

1350
01:45:13,474 --> 01:45:16,421
But the mighty humans
below the minds..

1351
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:22,359
But the mighty humans
below the minds..

1352
01:45:22,483 --> 01:45:25,623
Were controlled by the muscles.

1353
01:45:25,753 --> 01:45:28,666
"In the castes which is the
lowest cast? Oh crazy"

1354
01:45:28,856 --> 01:45:31,666
"which is the topmost
amongst the temples"

1355
01:45:32,026 --> 01:45:34,836
"Birth and death story and the
question in everyone's..

1356
01:45:34,962 --> 01:45:37,533
"..Mind that which is down
and which is up."

1357
01:45:37,898 --> 01:45:40,504
"..mind that which is down
and which is up."

1358
01:45:41,068 --> 01:45:43,571
"..mind that which is down
and which is up."

1359
01:45:43,871 --> 01:45:45,782

...is the real king
Harishchandra.

1361
01:45:48,976 --> 01:45:51,718
Just to keep a small
promise of his, ..

1362
01:45:51,846 --> 01:45:53,792
...he has given away his empire

1363
01:45:53,981 --> 01:45:56,655
and sold of his son and wife.

1364
01:45:56,918 --> 01:46:00,388
Now he is ready to
sell off himself.

1365
01:46:00,788 --> 01:46:02,495
Not very expensive.

1366
01:46:02,623 --> 01:46:03,658
Only ninety nine thousand..

1367
01:46:03,791 --> 01:46:07,398
...nine hundred ninety nine only,

1368
01:46:07,528 --> 01:46:09,530
means only One lake

1369
01:46:09,664 --> 01:46:11,701
Only one lake gold coins.

01:46:11,933 --> 01:46:13,606
One lake! One lake!

1371
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:16,112
One lake! One lake!

1372
01:46:27,081 --> 01:46:30,358
What did you say? You
are selling a slave?

1373
01:46:30,484 --> 01:46:33,954
No I am getting him married
and so yelling for a bride.

01:46:34,088 --> 01:46:37,467
Go away, As if he is the buyer.

1375
01:46:37,592 --> 01:46:43,065
Shut up. Why are you yelling as
if you are on the death bed.

1376
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,840
Who do you think I am? I
am the guard to the..

1377
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:48,706
...crematory of this
whole village.

1378
01:46:49,370 --> 01:46:51,543
Veerabahu, got it?

1379
01:46:51,672 --> 01:46:56,382
Oh god! A guard to the
crematory? Low caste!

1380
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:59,514
Is that written on my forehead?

1381
01:46:59,714 --> 01:47:02,422
Hey keep yourself away from

1382
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:04,029

make me impure.

01:47:04,151 --> 01:47:05,630
Keep away! Keep away!

1384
01:47:05,853 --> 01:47:08,060
However far I go from you..

1385
01:47:08,556 --> 01:47:11,901
...but aren't we are standing
on the same floor?

1386
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:15,771
How will you avoid this?

1387
01:47:16,064 --> 01:47:18,476
To hell with your stupid logic.

1388
01:47:18,699 --> 01:47:21,077
Who do you think I am?

1389
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:23,472
I am the follower of the great
hermit Vishwamitra.

1390
01:47:23,604 --> 01:47:25,606
"Nakshatrika -Oh!!!!!!!!

1391
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:29,711
So you're Nakshatrika the
follower of Vishwamitra?

1392
01:47:30,111 --> 01:47:31,920

1396
01:47:44,425 --> 01:47:46,928
You a biggest sinner, It
is a sin, it is a sin.

1397
01:47:47,061 --> 01:47:49,564
You will lose your eyes.-Doesn't

1398
01:47:49,863 --> 01:47:52,537
At least I don't have to
see your dirty face.

01:48:19,126 --> 01:48:23,871
...by human beings but all
are equal for god.

1410
01:48:25,099 --> 01:48:27,773
Biggest sin is not to
keep your promise.

Look the sun is setting before
that please sell me fast.

to do it. Not possible.

give this man..

1450

Why did you get that?

1451
01:51:20,808 --> 01:51:22,754

Why do you stare like
this up and down?

1456
01:51:36,991 --> 01:51:43,533
We eat this after meals but you
are eating it before meals

1457
01:51:43,931 --> 01:51:47,504
I find all your habits
a bit weird

What? Did I invite
you for lunch?

1462
01:51:58,946 --> 01:52:01,790
Didn't you? Did I?

01:52:29,309 --> 01:52:31,653
...lunch without even
informing me.

1471
01:52:31,945 --> 01:52:33,390
And even if he invites you,..

1472
01:52:33,513 --> 01:52:36,824
...how dare you drop in like
this just to have lunch?

1473
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:39,792
Do you think this is a free
lunch home? What is it?

1474
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,027
Madam wait. Please
wait a minute.

1475
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:43,192

The people of this village
are scared of me.

Which mother has given him
birth. He has gone insane.

1484

"I have been waiting for you on
the fool moon day with a..

1517
01:55:57,117 --> 01:55:59,495
...a sweet smile on my face"

1518
01:56:01,488 --> 01:56:02,694
Yes coming! Coming!

1519
01:56:02,956 --> 01:56:09,430
"When you for me and me for you
are waiting for each other"

1520
01:56:09,563 --> 01:56:12,510
"then please oh dear moon
fulfill our wishes"

1521
01:56:12,632 --> 01:56:15,408
"please drive away the boredom"

1522
01:56:25,011 --> 01:56:27,992
"I have beautiful flowers
in my hair..

1523
01:56:28,282 --> 01:56:31,456

"I have beautiful flowers

...and pretty ornaments on it.

1526
01:56:40,627 --> 01:56:44,905
The monsoon! The monsoon
is unbearable.

1527
01:56:45,031 --> 01:56:46,339
Then?

1528
01:56:46,567 --> 01:56:52,381
"When you for me and me for you
are waiting for each other"

1529
01:56:52,973 --> 01:56:55,954
"then please oh dear moon
fulfill our wishes"

1530
01:56:56,076 --> 01:56:59,216
"please drive away the boredom"

1531
01:57:01,281 --> 01:57:03,454
Veeradasa how was it?

1532
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:08,265
I haven't seen it master I was
busy with your service.

1533
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:10,831
I wasn't paying attention there.

1534
01:57:11,392 --> 01:57:14,999
That's like a good slave.
Master's worshiper.

1535
01:57:15,562 --> 01:57:18,873
I am very happy and pleased
with your service.

1536
01:57:19,533 --> 01:57:21,877
Now onwards you will
guard the crematory.

1537
01:57:22,769 --> 01:57:25,978
Hey you get that blanket
and the rod.

1538
01:57:29,810 --> 01:57:31,619
Take this.

1539
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:35,782
You will have to take one gift,

1540
01:57:35,916 --> 01:57:38,396
some money and little rice
for each dead body.

1541
01:57:38,952 --> 01:57:41,865
One who doesn't give this much
will not be allowed to..

1542
01:57:41,989 --> 01:57:45,493
...cremate the body.
-Yes my lord!

1543
01:57:46,326 --> 01:57:51,036
From that money and clothes will
be mine and rice yours.

1544
01:57:51,832 --> 01:57:54,904
Yes my lord! -Go
and be truthful.

1545
01:57:59,707 --> 01:58:03,177
Whatever you say but we are the
sinner and responsible..

1546
01:58:03,643 --> 01:58:05,623
...for the condition of his
highness Harishchandra.

1547
01:58:06,013 --> 01:58:09,426
Nothing can wash away
this sin my master.

1548
01:58:10,684 --> 01:58:12,721
Nakshatrika what the
hell are you saying?

1549
01:58:13,019 --> 01:58:14,623
I am telling you the
truth, my master.

1550
01:58:14,988 --> 01:58:17,525
Forget about me just
think about you.

1551
01:58:17,925 --> 01:58:20,531
You thought you can ruin
Harishchandra..

1552
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:23,402
...with all your spiritual
powers.

1553
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:28,372
The more you trouble
him the more..

1554
01:58:28,502 --> 01:58:32,473
...he gets sparkled like a gem
and more you are defamed.

1555
01:58:33,006 --> 01:58:40,288
Thinking of it you are getting
frustrated and me too.

1556
01:58:40,647 --> 01:58:43,992
Stop that nonsense.
It's not over yet.

1557
01:58:44,785 --> 01:58:47,391
Sufferings for Harishchandra
are stored for future.

1558
01:58:47,788 --> 01:58:51,497
I have a request, hermit.
-What is it?

1559
01:58:52,392 --> 01:58:53,564
Master the sin for the
sufferings or..

1560
01:58:53,693 --> 01:58:55,331
...Harishchandra due
to me are mine

1561
01:58:56,063 --> 01:58:57,804
but you will be the sinner for
the sufferings you gave him

1562
01:58:58,698 --> 01:59:00,575
My humble request is to
just forgive him..

1563
01:59:00,701 --> 01:59:02,840
...and let him go now.
Enough is enough.

1564
01:59:03,337 --> 01:59:04,441
You will save your prestige.

1565
01:59:04,571 --> 01:59:07,814
Shut up you dumb. -Sorry sorry.

1566
01:59:08,575 --> 01:59:11,215
So you want to be adamant.

1567
01:59:11,645 --> 01:59:14,592
Me being your first follower..

1568
01:59:14,848 --> 01:59:20,799
...I will obey but I have found
the inspiration which I was..

1569
01:59:21,321 --> 01:59:22,493
...looking for what is it?

1570
01:59:22,789 --> 01:59:27,397
On this whole earth one has to
go as per their own fate.

1571
01:59:27,727 --> 01:59:28,967
I will take your leave.

1572
01:59:41,975 --> 01:59:45,616
Respected lady, please
tell me one..

1573
01:59:45,745 --> 01:59:48,919
...thing. Did I really buy you.

1574
01:59:49,616 --> 01:59:54,656
Have I done this sin?
Please forgive me.

1575
01:59:55,255 --> 01:59:58,202
Master this is not a sin instead
you have done a great ..

1576
01:59:58,759 --> 02:00:02,332
...favor on us by releasing
my husband from the debt.

1577
02:00:02,462 --> 02:00:05,671
Is that me who has relieved
your husband from the debt?

1578
02:00:05,999 --> 02:00:09,208
Oh god what is wrong with
me? My mind my head

1579
02:00:09,336 --> 02:00:12,374

and so you behave like this.

1580
02:00:12,506 --> 02:00:16,386
Hey you has he started all
the same story again.

1581
02:00:16,509 --> 02:00:19,581

02:00:19,879 --> 02:00:21,552
Hey all of you come here again.

you are doing it.

1592
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:48,584
Oh ho. Look at him. Since
morning he has been doing..

1593
02:00:48,809 --> 02:00:51,688
...doing the same job. He is

Just trying to save your work?

"..Tacos and the curds rice

1684
02:09:20,953 --> 02:09:25,424
"To taste the delicacies
will be a great fun."

1685
02:09:25,558 --> 02:09:29,563
"The bulging tummy, the
tummy The tummy."

1686
02:09:29,696 --> 02:09:31,471
"Tomorrow is the death
anniversary"

1687
02:09:31,598 --> 02:09:33,600
"the thought of feast on

1688
02:09:33,866 --> 02:09:38,212
"The tongue is dancing
with joy."

02:09:49,382 --> 02:09:53,228
No that's wrong. My mother has
told me I will also work.

1691
02:09:53,353 --> 02:09:56,425
You will work? What
work will you do?

will spread in you

1709
02:12:02,315 --> 02:12:03,521
If we stay here, madam
will beat us.

1710
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:06,392
Let's go. Let's go.

1711
02:12:07,153 --> 02:12:09,929
Madam! Madam!

1712
02:12:11,624 --> 02:12:14,867
You all are back?
Where is my son?

1713
02:12:22,268 --> 02:12:26,216
Why are you scared? My
mouth is getting dry

1714
02:12:26,839 --> 02:12:29,786
Please tell me where is my son?

1715
02:12:30,543 --> 02:12:34,286
Where we went. There was
one small mount of mud.

1716
02:12:34,513 --> 02:12:36,220
There was a lot of grass on it
Lohita was standing near it

1717
02:12:36,349 --> 02:12:38,386
There was a lot of grass on

1718
02:12:38,518 --> 02:12:41,294
it Lohita was standing near it

1719
02:12:42,988 --> 02:12:45,264
When we went near and saw.
There was one snake.

1720
02:12:45,391 --> 02:12:49,168
When we went close by the snake
had already bit him.

1721
02:12:53,332 --> 02:12:58,577
Mother! Mother! Mother!

1722
02:13:03,810 --> 02:13:06,256
This is all my fate.

1723
02:13:07,213 --> 02:13:09,454
Before he takes his last..

1724
02:13:09,582 --> 02:13:11,357
...breath please allow
me to go and see him.

1725
02:13:11,617 --> 02:13:13,619
Where do I get the
permission from.

1726
02:13:13,853 --> 02:13:17,494
I told him to get the grass

1727
02:13:17,623 --> 02:13:19,296
Who asked him to go
near the snake?

1728
02:13:19,425 --> 02:13:21,632
Will it not bite
if you tease it?

1729
02:13:21,761 --> 02:13:23,434
Will he not die if it bites?

1730
02:13:23,562 --> 02:13:26,099
Then why do you cry if he dies?

1731
02:13:28,601 --> 02:13:31,172
It is the mother's heart
I am his mother

1732
02:13:31,604 --> 02:13:34,107
You see if you are his mother
then we are you masters.

1733
02:13:34,574 --> 02:13:35,382
We bought you. You are our maid.

1734
02:13:35,608 --> 02:13:37,815
If you die we will
face a great loss.

1735
02:13:38,244 --> 02:13:41,316
Why think of profit and
loss now? You go.

1736
02:13:41,614 --> 02:13:43,594

02:13:48,721 --> 02:13:52,498
How is it possible? Who will
do tomorrow's preparations.

02:13:52,625 --> 02:13:55,196
You will do it Your granny
will do it. You go.

1741
02:13:55,728 --> 02:13:58,402
Just wait. Where are
you heading to.

1742
02:13:58,731 --> 02:14:02,304
She is pretending.
This is her game.

1743
02:14:02,434 --> 02:14:05,847
She has instructed
her son to do so

1744
02:14:06,372 --> 02:14:08,750
and now she is also going.

1745
02:14:08,874 --> 02:14:13,482
You keep all your stories
with you now. You go.

1746
02:14:13,646 --> 02:14:16,149
Who are you to instruct her?

1747
02:14:16,282 --> 02:14:19,786
I am your husband
and she my maid.

1748
02:14:19,918 --> 02:14:21,192
I bought her. You go.

1749
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:23,197
For so long you said
you did not buy her.

1750
02:14:23,322 --> 02:14:25,768
But now I admit that I bought
her. Ask Vishwas.

1751
02:14:25,891 --> 02:14:27,700
He is the witness.
Why don't you go?

1752
02:14:27,827 --> 02:14:29,829
I am your boss you
must listen to me

1753
02:14:29,962 --> 02:14:33,171
I am her husband you
must listen to me.

this? I will thrash you now

1755
02:14:36,235 --> 02:14:37,737
Come on go inside.

1756
02:14:37,870 --> 02:14:42,546
Hey all of you come on go
and get the home remedy.

1757
02:14:42,675 --> 02:14:44,848
What? Lemon.

1758
02:14:45,644 --> 02:14:46,884
Lord Vishwanath.

1759
02:14:57,890 --> 02:14:59,164
Lohita.

1760
02:15:04,430 --> 02:15:06,842
Lohita, Lohita.

1761
02:15:12,137 --> 02:15:14,447
Lohita, Lohita.

1762
02:15:15,541 --> 02:15:20,547
Where are you my son. Please
look at me my son.

1763
02:15:20,947 --> 02:15:26,556
Please see your mother
is here. Talk to me.

1764
02:15:26,853 --> 02:15:34,237
Only once open your eyes
and call me mother!

1765
02:15:36,262 --> 02:15:43,202
The body has become dark You
have deceived me dear.

1766
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:48,315
You deserve to be in the palace

1767
02:15:49,708 --> 02:15:55,681
but see what kind of
death you received.

1768
02:15:57,183 --> 02:15:59,094
I did not repent for
leaving the palace,

1769
02:15:59,518 --> 02:16:02,727
to the forest and nor
when I became a maid.

1770
02:16:03,889 --> 02:16:08,804
But now I am in great pain
to see you die like this.

1771
02:16:10,729 --> 02:16:13,209
My son, my dear son.

1772
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:19,181
I cannot see you dying like this

1773
02:16:19,906 --> 02:16:24,377
I can't endure this. You
died leaving me back.

1774
02:16:37,223 --> 02:16:43,265
Sages in the sky and
Demons on the earth

1775
02:16:43,896 --> 02:16:49,437
Angles in the air and mermaids
in the water.

1776
02:16:50,603 --> 02:16:57,179
All the seven earths
are still and silent

1777
02:16:57,643 --> 02:17:03,719
Until you wake up and
open your eyes.

1778
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:09,460
You have taken away
the grace of all.

1779
02:17:12,191 --> 02:17:18,540
The happy home, the
twinkling eyes

1780
02:17:18,931 --> 02:17:24,438
you are the prestigious..

1781
02:17:26,238 --> 02:17:30,778
...heir of our next generation
you have parted from me.

1782
02:17:32,778 --> 02:17:36,351
Dad Dad dad Dad Dad dad

1783
02:17:36,615 --> 02:17:45,296
Why do I feel as if my Lohita
is calling me every minute?

1784
02:17:48,393 --> 02:17:51,704
I wonder where he is? How is he?

1785
02:17:54,366 --> 02:17:56,846
My heart sinks of distress.

1786
02:18:15,387 --> 02:18:20,564
My beloved son. How
unfortunate I am.

1787
02:18:21,861 --> 02:18:25,638
The hands which has
to cradle you,

1788
02:18:26,632 --> 02:18:31,240
caress you those hands..

1789
02:18:32,571 --> 02:18:38,522
...are doing this unfortunate
deed today.

1790
02:18:39,578 --> 02:18:42,252
My son dear son.

1791
02:18:47,453 --> 02:18:51,128
This ceremony which you are
suppose to do for me

1792
02:18:51,891 --> 02:18:55,634
Today I am doing it for you.

1793
02:18:56,529 --> 02:18:57,667
How unfortunate.

1794
02:18:58,764 --> 02:19:06,478
If your father asks
me where is my son

1795
02:19:07,273 --> 02:19:11,312
then what should I say.

1796
02:19:11,544 --> 02:19:14,548
My son. Dear son.

1797
02:19:15,881 --> 02:19:18,384
Wait! Who are you?

1798
02:19:19,418 --> 02:19:21,830
Not only have you
entered without..

1799
02:19:22,454 --> 02:19:26,402
...permission but you have
arranged for the cremation..

1800
02:19:33,666 --> 02:19:37,204
Gentleman he my son.

1801
02:19:38,537 --> 02:19:40,210
He died out of snake bite.

1802
02:19:41,774 --> 02:19:44,618
I have to cremate him as early
as possible before dawn

1803
02:19:44,743 --> 02:19:46,745
...and resume my work.

1804
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:54,922
My heart sank listening
to your story.

1805
02:19:55,954 --> 02:19:57,695
But I need to do my duty

1806
02:19:59,491 --> 02:20:00,731
First answer my questions.

1807
02:20:01,493 --> 02:20:04,702
With whose permission ..you
are cremating him

1808
02:20:06,231 --> 02:20:11,112
Do I need a permission
to cremate my own son?

1809
02:20:13,338 --> 02:20:15,477
Yes that is the rule here.

1810
02:20:16,842 --> 02:20:18,378
I don't understand all that.

1811
02:20:18,644 --> 02:20:20,385
No matter who it is.

1812
02:20:21,346 --> 02:20:22,381
It is the rule.

1813
02:20:23,115 --> 02:20:25,152
Whoever brings the dead
body for cremation..

1814
02:20:25,917 --> 02:20:30,866
...has to give me one paid of
clothes, money and rice.

1815
02:20:31,657 --> 02:20:33,068
Only then he is allowed
to burn the body.

1816
02:20:34,492 --> 02:20:38,201
You see I myself am a popper.

1817
02:20:39,731 --> 02:20:41,210
I am a maid at someone..

1818
02:20:42,601 --> 02:20:46,743
...else's house I have
nothing to give you.

1819
02:20:48,573 --> 02:20:52,885
Please be kind enough and
allow me to cremate him.

1820
02:20:55,413 --> 02:21:02,160
I am very touched and sorry
to see your condition

1821
02:21:02,554 --> 02:21:05,592
but I am helpless.

1822
02:21:07,826 --> 02:21:10,534
I can leave my share of rice

1823
02:21:11,263 --> 02:21:14,733
but my master's share
which is clothes

1824
02:21:15,434 --> 02:21:17,914
and money has to
be given to him.

1825
02:21:19,137 --> 02:21:21,117
So you will have to arrange
for it somehow.

1826
02:21:21,473 --> 02:21:22,816
If you are unable to do that,

1827
02:21:23,509 --> 02:21:26,115
you will have to take this body
somewhere else and cremate.

1828
02:21:28,580 --> 02:21:29,820
My son.

1829
02:21:31,516 --> 02:21:32,517
My son.

1830
02:21:33,919 --> 02:21:39,870
You who should have been the
ruler of this kingdom..

1831
02:21:42,761 --> 02:21:46,538
...is now deprived of the small
place for cremation.

1832
02:21:47,466 --> 02:21:50,572
How unfortunate we are dear.

1833
02:21:51,603 --> 02:21:54,812
<i>Lady you sound so wowed.</i>

1834
02:21:55,841 --> 02:21:58,412
A minute ago you said
you were a popper.

1835
02:21:59,278 --> 02:22:04,489
And now you say that your
son is a prince.

1836
02:22:05,384 --> 02:22:07,364
I don't understand anything.

1837
02:22:07,719 --> 02:22:12,668
I am the wife of king
Harishchandra.

1838
02:22:15,427 --> 02:22:17,737
He is our only son.

1839
02:22:18,130 --> 02:22:21,373
Oh Harishchandra.

1840
02:22:22,367 --> 02:22:25,507
You have lost your only son too.

1841
02:22:26,638 --> 02:22:29,517
The empire of Suryavansha
has ended.

1842
02:22:35,847 --> 02:22:38,487
Do you know my husband?

1843
02:22:38,783 --> 02:22:39,784
Yes I know him.

1844
02:22:40,419 --> 02:22:43,093
He has donated his all his
belongs and has sold his..

1845
02:22:44,189 --> 02:22:48,660
...son and wife too
and that devil..

1846
02:22:49,761 --> 02:22:53,174
Stop it. How dare you something
bad about my lord?

1847
02:22:55,334 --> 02:22:57,541
I am unable to hear
those dirty words.

1848
02:22:58,303 --> 02:23:01,307
You have no idea about the
good qualities of his.

1849
02:23:02,107 --> 02:23:06,021
In that case Harishchandra
will surely..

1850
02:23:06,144 --> 02:23:09,125
...pay the expenses for
the last rites.

1851
02:23:10,682 --> 02:23:14,220
Go and ask your king.

1852
02:23:15,354 --> 02:23:17,095
If he didn't give..

1853
02:23:21,593 --> 02:23:25,837
7'?

1854
02:23:26,532 --> 02:23:31,675
?????

1855
02:23:31,803 --> 02:23:36,718
?????

1856
02:23:37,142 --> 02:23:39,782
?????

1857
02:23:40,212 --> 02:23:45,457
?????

1858
02:23:45,584 --> 02:23:53,730
?????

1859
02:23:54,126 --> 02:23:57,300
Oh my god how could he see
my Mangalyam (chain)

1860
02:23:57,762 --> 02:24:01,608
Except my husband no
one else can see it.

1861
02:24:02,567 --> 02:24:05,070
How did this boon go fake?

1862
02:24:06,638 --> 02:24:11,212
Or else the crematory guard..

1863
02:24:20,418 --> 02:24:23,365
...is my...my lord.

1864
02:24:29,261 --> 02:24:30,763
Calm down!

1865
02:24:31,229 --> 02:24:33,038
My dear, calm down!

1866
02:24:35,467 --> 02:24:41,816
My lord we shouldn't have met
each other in such a situation

1867
02:24:43,174 --> 02:24:47,486
We shouldn't have faced
this situation.

1868
02:24:48,313 --> 02:24:51,123
We will have to face our
fate. Please be patient.

1869
02:24:53,252 --> 02:24:58,793
My lord, what will we do
for our son's cremation.

1870
02:24:59,524 --> 02:25:07,341
Dear I am unable to arrange
for our sons cremation.

1871
02:25:10,068 --> 02:25:12,139
In such a condition
also you have..

1872
02:25:12,270 --> 02:25:14,511
...not given up your principles.

1873
02:25:14,773 --> 02:25:16,150
I am very fortunate.

1874
02:25:17,242 --> 02:25:20,155
My dear please go and
sell your Mangalya..

1875
02:25:20,278 --> 02:25:23,657
...and get the necessary things.

1876
02:25:24,282 --> 02:25:26,057
Go my dear go.

1877
02:25:26,518 --> 02:25:27,519
Go my dear go.

1878
02:25:38,897 --> 02:25:41,503
My son my prince Lohita.

1879
02:25:45,237 --> 02:25:46,079
My son my beloved

1880
02:25:47,472 --> 02:25:55,789
You were our old age support but

1881
02:25:56,314 --> 02:25:58,794
your life has ended
up like this.

1882
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:01,355
Lohita Lohita

1883
02:26:06,858 --> 02:26:10,396
You the heir of this kingdom..

Is deprived of three feet
land for cremation.

1885
02:26:15,834 --> 02:26:18,474
Lohita Lohita

1886
02:26:19,671 --> 02:26:21,651
Lohita Lohita

1887
02:26:24,509 --> 02:26:26,648
Go in the disguise of
Chandramati into the king's..

1888
02:26:26,844 --> 02:26:29,120
...palace and steal their child.

1889
02:26:29,414 --> 02:26:32,793
I get it, my Lord.

1890
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:25,543
Thief! Thief! Thief! Catch
her! Catch her.

1891
02:27:25,670 --> 02:27:27,547
My baby my child.
Come on be fast.

02:27:28,406 --> 02:27:32,479
Hey. stop! -Hey thief!

1893
02:27:32,610 --> 02:27:35,318
Don't run! -Catch her!

1894
02:28:30,835 --> 02:28:32,041
Mother!

1895
02:28:35,173 --> 02:28:36,174
Mother!

1896
02:28:38,610 --> 02:28:40,021
Mother!

1897
02:28:41,345 --> 02:28:44,121
Mother!

1898
02:28:44,649 --> 02:28:46,128
Lohita! -Mother!

1899
02:28:46,785 --> 02:28:48,662
Where are you my son.

1900
02:28:49,321 --> 02:28:50,561
Lohita! -Mother!

1901
02:28:50,689 --> 02:28:52,066
Mother!

1902
02:28:52,557 --> 02:28:53,433
Mother!

1903
02:28:55,327 --> 02:28:56,567
Lohita!

1904
02:28:57,595 --> 02:28:58,767
Lohita!

1905
02:28:59,664 --> 02:29:00,734
Lohita!

1906
02:29:07,472 --> 02:29:08,678
My son.

1907
02:29:10,141 --> 02:29:11,119
My son.

1908
02:29:12,577 --> 02:29:17,083
Oh god why do you give children
if you have to take..

1909
02:29:18,650 --> 02:29:20,425
...them away like this.

1910
02:29:22,654 --> 02:29:26,295
Whose child is this?

1911
02:29:26,791 --> 02:29:30,603
What is the reason behind this.?

1912
02:29:34,666 --> 02:29:35,736
Who are you all?

1913
02:29:36,634 --> 02:29:41,674
You devil, thief. How dare you
take this child like this.

1914
02:29:42,507 --> 02:29:45,215
Please don't accuse me unless
you listen to me.

1915
02:29:46,544 --> 02:29:48,615
My son has died of snake bite

1916
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:53,856
I was going for arranging
for my sons cremation.

1917
02:29:54,819 --> 02:29:59,199
On my way I felt as if
my son has called me.

1918
02:30:00,024 --> 02:30:03,130
I came running here I
found him lying here.

1919
02:30:03,662 --> 02:30:07,303
We have seen you stealing
him from the palace.

1920
02:30:07,432 --> 02:30:09,503
Now you lie to us. You will
be punished for this.

1921
02:30:09,634 --> 02:30:11,341
Come with us.

1922
02:30:15,173 --> 02:30:17,813
Your highness I am innocent.

1923
02:30:18,376 --> 02:30:19,719
I don't know anything.

1924
02:30:20,178 --> 02:30:22,055
Just shut up.

1925
02:30:25,450 --> 02:30:28,761
Take her to Veeradas
cut off her head..

1926
02:30:51,676 --> 02:30:54,122
Veeradasa! Veeradasa.

1927
02:31:01,686 --> 02:31:05,759
This woman has killed the king's
son, It is the king's order

1928
02:31:06,290 --> 02:31:08,292
Cut off her head. Take this axe.

1929
02:31:09,627 --> 02:31:11,129
Yes my lord!

1930
02:31:16,234 --> 02:31:17,406
Oh God!

1931
02:31:19,070 --> 02:31:21,778
So you are making me this too.

1932
02:31:24,409 --> 02:31:25,615
As you wish.

1933
02:31:48,700 --> 02:31:50,407
Who?

1934
02:31:52,737 --> 02:31:54,774
Lady, you?

1935
02:31:58,309 --> 02:31:59,982
M I in my senses

1936
02:32:00,712 --> 02:32:06,128
or have you really
killed the child.

1937
02:32:07,285 --> 02:32:09,231
No, its unbelievable.

1938
02:32:09,687 --> 02:32:12,395
I will not believe this. No.

1939
02:32:12,624 --> 02:32:16,663
My lord. If it is destined to us

1940
02:32:17,195 --> 02:32:19,573
then it is useless whether
you believe it or not.

1941
02:32:20,164 --> 02:32:24,704
You who are always humble,
polite, soft hearted and kind..

1942
02:32:25,837 --> 02:32:29,011
The who always prayed for the
welfare of the people.

1943
02:32:30,308 --> 02:32:33,653
To every human being like an
ideal to the whole world.

1944
02:32:35,246 --> 02:32:39,126
This accusation is definitely
the destiny.

1945
02:32:41,085 --> 02:32:42,189
May be it is.

1946
02:32:43,455 --> 02:32:46,095
Lady how did this happen?

1947
02:32:46,591 --> 02:32:48,434
While I was going from here,

1948
02:32:49,193 --> 02:32:51,332
I saw a dead body of a child..

1949
02:32:53,364 --> 02:32:55,207
...he seem to me like Lohita

1950
02:32:56,234 --> 02:32:57,474
I lost my senses.

1951
02:32:58,469 --> 02:32:59,379
In the mean..

1952
02:32:59,737 --> 02:33:02,718
"Time the officer came and
misunderstanding me as a..

1953
02:33:03,341 --> 02:33:05,378
...killer he took me to the king.

1954
02:33:06,778 --> 02:33:08,724
The king who was in the..

1955
02:33:09,447 --> 02:33:11,085
...agony of loosing his son
with out having a second..

1956
02:33:11,516 --> 02:33:13,223
...thought and listening to me
announced the punishment.

1957
02:33:13,451 --> 02:33:18,457
You the innocent who herself is
in the agony of loosing a son.

1958
02:33:21,092 --> 02:33:23,732
A son has been destined to
get her head cut off.

1959
02:33:24,262 --> 02:33:26,674
My Lord, don't worry.

1960
02:33:27,432 --> 02:33:29,309
Instead of dying a bad death..

1961
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:32,780
...I am happy that I am
dying in front of you

1962
02:33:33,738 --> 02:33:36,048
and that with your hands.

1963
02:33:36,841 --> 02:33:39,720
How fortunate I am.

1964
02:33:40,545 --> 02:33:42,923
I am sure you will go by your
principles whole heartedly.

1965
02:33:45,783 --> 02:33:47,319
Yes me being your husband and

1966
02:33:48,519 --> 02:33:49,759
the king I will definitely
abide by my principles.

1967
02:33:58,429 --> 02:34:02,377
Lady for the last time
remember the almighty

1968
02:34:04,169 --> 02:34:05,307
and get ready for the death.

1969
02:34:11,776 --> 02:34:19,251
"Of all the poor brotherhood,
worshiped by the whole world.

1970
02:34:19,851 --> 02:34:24,095
In all my hundred
births in future

1971
02:34:24,355 --> 02:34:29,355
make me the queen of
Harishchandra. Oh god.

1972
02:34:37,802 --> 02:34:42,911
The one who is the preacher
and follower of the truth..

1973
02:34:43,174 --> 02:34:44,983
And an ideal to the
whole world..

1974
02:34:45,109 --> 02:34:50,923
...be him the same in every
birth of his too. Oh god.

1975
02:35:04,462 --> 02:35:07,306
The hands which tied the
Mangalyam, the same..

1976
02:35:07,732 --> 02:35:10,770
"..Hands are holding a
butcher's axe today,

1977
02:35:11,102 --> 02:35:16,984
what kind of destiny have
you given me oh lord.

1978
02:35:17,875 --> 02:35:23,416
Me the king of Suryavansha
kingdom, keeping aside every..

1979
02:35:23,714 --> 02:35:25,751
...cultural ethics,
will be a sinner..

1980
02:35:25,883 --> 02:35:28,090
...by killing an innocent female.

1981
02:35:29,286 --> 02:35:32,324
Leaving all the doubts, ..

1982
02:35:32,457 --> 02:35:35,199
...self respect, and compassion,
today ..

1983
02:35:35,326 --> 02:35:40,036
...stone heartedly thinking
that whatever happens..

1984
02:35:42,533 --> 02:35:48,415
...will happens in the presence
of the almighty..

1985
02:35:48,539 --> 02:35:55,320
...and with all his permission.

1986
02:35:55,780 --> 02:36:00,286
In all my good and bad deeds
the one who was always..

1987
02:36:00,417 --> 02:36:04,388
...a part of me and shared
everything equally,

1988
02:36:05,056 --> 02:36:09,129
...now cutting off her head
and offering it to you.

1989
02:36:09,393 --> 02:36:15,833
Please accept it oh lord.

1990
02:36:15,967 --> 02:36:20,973
Wait! What were you upto.
What a blunder.

1991
02:36:21,906 --> 02:36:24,011
You the emperor of Suryavansha
Kingdom..

1992
02:36:24,341 --> 02:36:28,312
...sold your wife, became
a slave to the demon..

1993
02:36:30,281 --> 02:36:32,227
Now ready to kill a female?

1994
02:36:32,883 --> 02:36:35,124
How stone hearted you are.

1995
02:36:35,886 --> 02:36:39,698
To kill your innocent wife
is not your culture.

1996
02:36:41,058 --> 02:36:43,868
These things don't matter
in our duties

1997
02:36:44,962 --> 02:36:46,999
Now I am a slave to my
master Veerabahya.

1998
02:36:47,965 --> 02:36:50,741
And my duty is to
obey his orders.

1999
02:36:51,802 --> 02:36:53,907
I request you to go
away.-Shut up!

2000
02:36:54,205 --> 02:36:57,243
Harishchandra you have lost
everything you had yet you..

2001
02:36:57,909 --> 02:37:00,219
...haven't learnt a lesson?

2002
02:37:00,778 --> 02:37:05,989
Sir, until I don't loose my
truth I will not feel..

2003
02:37:06,851 --> 02:37:10,628
...that I have lost anything
on this earth.

2004
02:37:11,222 --> 02:37:14,328
Listen to me before the time
runs out or your hands.

2005
02:37:15,059 --> 02:37:16,868
I will save your child..

2006
02:37:17,428 --> 02:37:20,875
...and I will also free your
wife from the accusations.

2007
02:37:21,298 --> 02:37:24,802
I will also give you back
all your empire.

2008
02:37:25,169 --> 02:37:28,776
But get married to my daughters
and live happily for ever.

2009
02:37:29,774 --> 02:37:34,450
Since you belong to my
generation I sympathize you.

2010
02:37:35,713 --> 02:37:43,154
Hermit, you know everything.
Its your greatness.

2011
02:37:43,821 --> 02:37:47,792
You could have blessed me to do
my duty and obey my master.

2012
02:37:50,495 --> 02:37:53,271
As you wish Harishchandra.

2013
02:37:53,397 --> 02:37:55,707
God bless you Harishchandra

2014
02:37:57,868 --> 02:37:59,245
Your preacher has won.

2015
02:38:00,705 --> 02:38:03,345
There is hardly any time to
think about victory and loss..

2016
02:38:04,108 --> 02:38:06,088
...my preacher and everything.

2017
02:38:08,012 --> 02:38:09,923
Lady come on get ready.

2018
02:38:16,353 --> 02:38:24,238
Lady! Oh lord I am obeying my
master's orders bless me.

2019
02:38:32,270 --> 02:38:34,272
Appreciated Harishchandra
Appreciated Harishchandra

2020
02:38:34,705 --> 02:38:39,017
Your devotion towards truth
and trust has been tested..

2021
02:38:39,143 --> 02:38:41,316
...by Maharshi Vishwamitra.

2022
02:38:41,845 --> 02:38:45,952
King Kashi's son is still alive.

2023
02:38:46,283 --> 02:38:52,700
Mother. -Your son is also alive.

2024
02:38:54,192 --> 02:38:59,198
