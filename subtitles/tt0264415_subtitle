00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,819
[thunders rumbling]

2
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,991
In a wrong season,
that too continuously before Ugadi

3
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,781
I don't understand how it is
raining so much Minister.

4
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,654
Don't know how many more
days this would continue.

5
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:29,389
A woman with her infant
came to meet the king.

6
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:31,345
She needs to see our
king at once it seems.

7
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,609
Let her in.

8
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,872
[thunders rumbling]
Kids shout: Mom!

9
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:38,071
It's nothing son.

10
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:39,924
Mallika, take them to their room.

11
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:48,803
Who are you?

12
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,804
What help do you seek that
you have come in this weather?

13
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:55,930
I came here for my husband
who gave birth to this child.

14
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,079
You look like goddess
Lakshmi in human form.

15
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:00,628
Tell me who is that betrayer?

16
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:03,797
The king will punish
him and do justice to you.

17
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,756
It's the King Jai Chandra.

18
00:04:07,743 --> 00:04:08,752
King!

19
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,965
King!

20
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:13,445
After so long I see you!

21
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:17,973
I came here running after waiting
for your arrival for a long time.

22
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:20,109
Here is your boon to me!

23
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:21,424
What is this non-sense?

24
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:22,671
Who gave you this right?

25
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,111
Be careful you are crossing your limits!

26
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:26,322
Why are you silent, king?

27
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:30,542
Talk to your son who
shares your blood, for once.

28
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:33,715
Who are you?

29
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,520
King!

30
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:39,390
You are asking me who I am?

31
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:41,927
It's me! Vasundhara.

32
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:43,696
In the presence of the trees and lakes,

33
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:45,437
in the presence of the five elements,

34
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:50,821
you've married me and promised
me you would take me home soon.

35
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:52,304
I am the same Vasundhara.

36
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,310
She commited a mistake blinded by lust,

37
00:04:54,838 --> 00:04:56,557
Blaming the king for her sin,

38
00:04:56,957 --> 00:05:00,378
she plotted to become the queen and
make her son the heir to the throne.

39
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:02,164
Put this cunning lady in prison!

40
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:04,509
Stop!

41
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,890
[chuckles]

42
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:10,102
She is in a state of madness that
she doesn't know what she is talking.

43
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:11,464
Let her go.

44
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:12,280
Stop!

45
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:14,934
If seeking justice is madness,

46
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,729
then breaking a promise is utter madness.

47
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,193
Even if you don't agree,

48
00:05:19,963 --> 00:05:22,158
that won't change the truth.

49
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,181
I didn't come here dreaming
that he should become a king...

50
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:29,373
...and rule the kingdom or me
being your queen sharing the throne.

51
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,548
But, wherever my son might be and
in which situation he might be,

52
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:37,945
I'll prove that he will rule the
entire world with his own strength.

53
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:41,906
Time will prove the truth in my words.

54
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,439
Goodbye!

Ah!

63
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:36,788

65
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:40,757
Son!

66
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:43,267
Son! Ah!

00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:58,743
Master! Master!

69
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:02,565
Some woman came down in the river

70
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:03,754
[birds chirping]

71
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:20,749
My son!
[panting]

72
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:22,425
Where is my infant?

73
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:24,298
How did I reach here?

74
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:26,877
You are in the Ashram of
the Jamadagni, the great sage.

75
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,000
Hermit! Hermit!

76
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:34,323
Hermit, you are my only hope.

77
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:38,729
Please see that I get my infant son back.

78
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:53,833
Look, she is goddess Vajreshwari Devi,

79
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:56,975
She is the one who saves
our Ashram and this area

80
00:07:57,551 --> 00:08:01,255
and the one who gives us
self-confidence and power.

81
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:09,830
Oh saviour goddess! Where is my son?

82
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:13,066
In which situation he is?
I'll go search for him.

83
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:16,739
Please show me the way goddess.
[sobs]

84
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:17,953
Don't be emotional child.

85
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,009
How and where can
you search for your son?

86
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:23,203
Just wait keeping your
trust on the goddess.

87
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:26,135
The goddess will show
you the way when the time comes.

88
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:29,837
Why do I need this life
if my son is not alive hermit?

89
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,269
Please allow me,
I'll go in search of my son.

90
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:36,126
If I can't find
him I'll go disappeared.

91
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:37,714
Don't lose your courage child

92
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:55,521
See this?
This is the sign of your son.

93
00:08:56,323 --> 00:08:57,891
Your son is very much alive.

94
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,123
Is it hermit?

95
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:01,411
As long as this flower is blooming,

96
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:04,472
your son will be safe wherever he is.

Tribal queen, look he is the
child we found in the river.

103
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:28,904
He was smiling in the basket
while the river carried him here.

104
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,583
The god has given him to the
river and the river gave him to us.

105
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:34,592
Today is Ugadi festival.

106
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:37,354
It's a good omen as this child has
come to us on this festive day.

107
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,319
-What do you say hubby?
-Yes, my wife.

108
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,602
We will raise him and get him
trained in stick fight and sword fighting.

109
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:43,481
That's okay.

110
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:45,609
We will make him educate
under a good teacher...

111
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:47,842
...so that he doesn't
speak our langauge and style.

112
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:51,350
As he has come to our
house on the day of festival,

113
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,697
I'll name him as Vijay.

114
00:09:52,997 --> 00:09:54,907
The name Vijay is very good.

115
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:56,689

116
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:58,883

Vijay, I am coming you don't be affraid.

124
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,652
Catch the Horse without any fear.

125
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,386
That is a wild Horse,
is it possible for them to catch it?

126
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:37,229
It might be a wild
Horse or mountain Horse,

127
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,119

Come on, throw!

137
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:58,113
You should rotate the rope
and throw around it's neck man.

138

What are these adventures?

You won't stop how much ever I say!

162
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:19,146
Shut up!
Are you telling him not to do adventures?

163
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:23,457
Vijay,
it's only you who could tame a wild Horse.

164
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:27,237
You have proved it again that there is
no one great than you in our village.

165
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:28,565
All the credit goes to you father.

166
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:30,309
You and mother raised me in that way.

167
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:31,414
Then what about me?

168
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:33,145
As they have given birth and raised you.

169
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:34,245
You are greater than me!

170
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:35,829

171
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:37,388
Alright Vijay,

172
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:39,841
make a wish in this happy
moment I'll make it true.

173
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:41,979
Wish? What wishes do I have?

174
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:45,589
Make a wish, why are you saying
no when your father is asking?

175
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:46,727
Father,

176
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:49,721
'What you said is nice,
and whatever I'm going to say it awesome"

177
00:12:50,107 --> 00:12:51,313
do you want me to make you say this?

178
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,809
-Say it man!
-Say it!

179
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:54,707
You only wish for something.

180
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,465
My wish is to fulfill your wish.

181
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,077
How is it! How is it!

[chuckles]
He is very smart.

183
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:02,461
Then I'll make a wish listen.

00:13:02,661 --> 00:13:04,638
-If you go towards the North-East
-Ok...

185
00:13:04,922 --> 00:13:05,977
They say there is a big forest.

186
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:07,938
And they say in that forest,
lies a Water Tree!

187
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:09,288
-Water Tree?
-Yes.

188
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,407
They say if you cut the branch
of that tree, water comes out.

189
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:15,403
If we drink that water,
old age will turn into young

190
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:17,268
-If you can bring those water...
-What?

191
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:19,835
Will you marry two more women and
roam around after drinking that water?

192
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:23,195
Let him marry mother...
our village would grow and grow!

-Come on!
-Wait! Wait!

196
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:29,027
-Are you really going?
-Yes.

197
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:32,778
Then would it be good if he
becomes young and I stay old?

198
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:34,685
Please bring some water for me too.

199
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:35,681
-Okay, we will bring.
-We will bring.

200

Brother Pandu, did you see?

209
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,384
Strange thing that we
don't see in this surroundings.

210
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:27,035
We can see colorful flowers only here.

211
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:30,149
I think the water plant should be nearby.

212
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:31,155

It's a good news.

with her. It's so entertaining.

Don't you know even the
bumblebees aren't allowed in the garden?

He has come...

325
00:24:11,442 --> 00:24:15,116
then don't you know to
catch him and bring him to me?

326
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:18,216
Without catching him you are
saying that you lost to him shamelessly?

It's a shame on us.

Isn't this shame for you that you are
holding the leadership of total army.

Should my brother go
even to save the girl?

331
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,789

here and what they were doing

He looks like a courageous hero father.

335
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,703
He has shown his prowess
in sword fighting.

-Yes.

-How did he come?
-He has come on a horse, king.

00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:47,696
I am not asking whether he
came on a horse or on an slephant.

340
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:49,620
I am asking in which
way he has come inside?

341
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,140
Why are you asking that hubby?

342
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,342
Tell them that no one
should enter here after.

343
00:24:53,655 --> 00:24:54,422
If they do,

344
00:24:54,764 --> 00:24:56,602
tell them to tie their hands and
legs and throw in front of you.

345
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:58,940
Did you hear the queen's orders?

346
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:00,840
Tell me if you cannot do this,

347
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:04,040
I'll restrict the girls
from entering the garden.

00:25:19,502 --> 00:25:21,268
What is this?

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,792
I can't see anything.

I didn't get my sight back!

354

Not leaving any stone unturned,
we used all medicines

355

-But...
-Yes...

357
00:25:35,209 --> 00:25:36,205
What could you do?

358
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:41,018
The sin I have commited
has punished me this way.

359
00:25:41,464 --> 00:25:43,787
-You have commited sins?
-Why didn't you te us before?

360
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:45,450
We've spent lakhs unnecessarily!

361
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,305
-What do you say brother South?
-Yes, brother North.

362
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,151
-So, patriarch.
-That means a father.

363
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:51,706
-Until you expire.
-Take rest.

364
00:25:51,914 --> 00:25:53,286
We will rule this kingdom.

365
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:56,799
You villains!
Since your mother passed away,

366
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:59,088
I raised you in a pampering manner...

367
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:01,041
-You didn't raise us.
-We grew on our own.

368
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:02,426
-So we will only rule.
-Yeah!

369
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:04,673
Fool! You want to rule the kingdom?

370
00:26:05,174 --> 00:26:08,275
Why can't we? Even the Cow's,
Buffalo's also rule for some time.

371
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:11,251
But you are ruling even at this age.

372
00:26:11,451 --> 00:26:12,697
Then when we will rule?

373
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:15,292
-See father.
-Pity, he can't see North.

374
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,429
-Oh! Then listen to me father.
-Yes.

375
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:19,777
From now we will sit on the throne.

376
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:20,617
That means sit on it.

377
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:21,873
-Brother,
-Yes?

378
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:23,843
-We have only one throne right?
-Yes.

379
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:25,466
How can we both rule on it?

380
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:28,037
Break the throne into two man! Break it!

381
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:29,022
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

382
00:26:29,327 --> 00:26:31,125
-We will break it into pieces
-Then we will rule on those pieces.

383
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,206
-We'll rule and soothe.
-Soothe and show you.

384
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:34,091
[laughs]

385
00:26:34,377 --> 00:26:36,743
Oh no! It's all my fate!

The damsel who is heating up the
moon light and is raising my longing.

390
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:54,946
What a beauty... What a stunner...

What beautiful cheeks, like Jasmine buds.

392
00:26:57,646 --> 00:26:59,928
Your face is like a sweet Pumpkin.

393
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:03,000
Your eyes are like daffodil petals.

394
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:06,711
Your teeth are like Pomegranate seeds.

Mosquito!

396
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,506

Vijay! Vijay!

398
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,884
What is this? You are
sleeping like this only.

399
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:17,635
If you feel sleepy then sleep.
[chuckles]

400
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:18,936
I am not feeling sleepy,

I closed my eyes.

00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:26,496
Shh! Don't make noise.

404
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,681
Stay quiet if it's not
possible to you like the other day.

405
00:27:30,143 --> 00:27:31,701
Would you be brave and go to war?

406
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,565
Would you act valiant and get into risk?

407
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,444
If you dare make the
princess fall in love with you.

408
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:40,930
You have mustache on your
face and courage on your nose.

409
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,270
We have horses to travel.

410

Hey, Vijay where are you going?

412
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,451
Whatever it takes I
should see my princess.

413
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:47,438
What's that? What's that?

414
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:49,266
Would I fall short after compelling you.
[horse neighs]

415
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:50,946
Shouldn't I see my Madanika?

416
00:27:51,146 --> 00:27:52,453
Vijay, wait am also coming.

cool moonlight and blooming flowers?"

418
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:51,005
"Tell me what's the matter dear girl!"

00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:56,497
"Why don't you be normal even after
applying sandal and serving you?"

420
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:59,505
"Accept the truth dear girl!"

421
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,822
"Is it that you don't have a pair?"

422
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:05,856
"This despair of yours..."

423
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:10,762
"Is this despair of yours
because you don't have a pair?"

424
00:29:11,944 --> 00:29:16,241
"Why isn't the fire put off even in
cool moonlight and blooming flowers?"

425
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,228
"Tell me what's the matter dear girl!"

430
00:29:44,596 --> 00:29:48,930
"Is this the magic of stealing my heart"

431
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:55,363
"Or the intoxication
of not forgetting you"

432
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,556
"What a strange love!"

433
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,416

"Maybe it's a rhyme of jasmines,
or an arrow from the floral bows!"

437
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:35,015
"Maybe it's a rhyme of jasmines,
or an arrow from the floral bows!"

"How strange is the bond of love!"

"Like a chirpy song"

443
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,705
"Maybe the bloom of the chills or the
despair drived me as a sweet wish"

444
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:45,929
"To see my love"

"The young lady's mere look has
the art of awakening dreams"

"In her tender beauty"

452
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:02,841
"The floral beauty's body has
the charm of raising heartbeats"

453
00:33:03,212 --> 00:33:05,169
"In this lovely flower"

"The celebration which
came to a standstill"

00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:16,123
"Wouldn't you come to answer
when my desire calls you"

456
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:20,764
"Why stay quiet, my lady, oh damsel!"

A singer in the ladies
room at this midnight,

Who are you man?

466
00:34:07,658 --> 00:34:10,743
He is the one king, who did sword
fight entering the Vasanta Garden.

467
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:13,068
Great! Is that you?

468
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:15,245

King, can't the person who's into
the royal ladies room, be into singing?

00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:21,075
Oh!

472
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:22,595
Why do you praise him hubby?

What Padma, when he was singing
and dancing entering into your room

474
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,643
you would have called us or you
would have called the soilders.

475
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:30,533
What were you doing? Were you sleeping?

476

No, queen they were awake.

477

They were guarding her
without closing their eyes.

478
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:37,637
It's me who jumped the
wall and came inside.

479
00:34:37,837 --> 00:34:42,642
Ah! Can a normal person easily
climb the castle wall and come?

480
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:44,913
First call the person
who has built that wall.

-We'll punish him.
-Oh no!

482
00:34:46,796 --> 00:34:49,206
We don't know whether he is alive or dead
and you are asking him to be punished.

483
00:34:49,682 --> 00:34:50,868
First punish him.

Who is he and who are you?

511
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,033
Do you romance with him?

512
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:35,300
If want to play,
play with your sister it's happiness.

513
00:37:35,668 --> 00:37:37,832
But why you are playing
with that youngster dear?

514
00:37:40,517 --> 00:37:42,459
That is why I am
asking you since many days,

515
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:44,940
that you have to get her
married but you aren't listening.

516

I gave a word that I'll get my
daughter married to their prince.

521
00:37:57,216 --> 00:37:59,302

523
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:02,567

Why do you worry?

into two pieces as you said.

529
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:18,464
Sitting one on each piece

530
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:20,932
they are doing atrocities
on the name of public rule.

531
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,830
They are torturing public and extracting
taxes for each and everthing king.

532
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:25,898
Are they extracting taxes?

533
00:38:26,122 --> 00:38:28,146
Are they any dentists to extract?

534
00:38:28,566 --> 00:38:30,265
It's a crime carrying the
official matters here.

535
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:32,386
And this blind king
listening to that is a big crime.

536
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:34,986
You both being in the palace
is a pain in the head to us

537
00:38:35,086 --> 00:38:35,997
That means headache.

538
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:38,642
Soldiers keep the Minister
in the jail and lock him up.

539
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:39,609
Not this lock!

540
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:42,077
Leave me! Leave me!

541
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:43,770
What is this atrocity? King!

542
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:44,970
What is this horrible deed?

543
00:38:45,244 --> 00:38:46,376
You dare punish the minister?

544
00:38:46,735 --> 00:38:48,216
Father you have a punishment too!

545
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:50,337
We banish you to forest.

546
00:38:50,437 --> 00:38:51,741
That means we will leave you in a forest.

547
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:53,116
-By the way brother.
-Yes, brother?

548
00:38:53,316 --> 00:38:54,539
As our father is blind right?

549
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:57,242
If we leave him in a forest he might
get hurt by the trees and branches.

550
00:38:58,197 --> 00:38:59,598
Then we will leave him in a desert.
[chuckles]

551
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:02,129
You morons! You would be damned.

552
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:04,861
It's a very big sin to punish your father.

553
00:39:05,061 --> 00:39:07,731
Don't talk about sins as we
are going on a good work.

554
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,198
We got an invitation from
the Karthikeya province.

555
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:12,798
Marriage sight with the princess.

556
00:39:12,898 --> 00:39:14,737
That means match making.

557
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:18,237
Before we leave, we want
to take blessings from you.

558
00:39:18,337 --> 00:39:19,969
That means we will bow to you.

559
00:39:20,169 --> 00:39:21,619
Damn! Stupids!

560
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:23,980
Both: Ah! Soldiers take him.

561
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:27,100
Hey, leave me man! Leave me.

562
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:29,026
Why are you listening to those stupids?

563
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,314
Leave me man!

564
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:34,296
Yes, Princes are coming from Chandra
Prabha province to see the princess.

565
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:37,371
Oh no! Did we sit here to
listen to this all the while?

566
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:39,812
Vijay, your problem isn't easy to solve

567
00:39:40,012 --> 00:39:41,321
We both will get married.

568
00:39:41,521 --> 00:39:42,330
-Come.
-Hey, wait!

569
00:39:42,961 --> 00:39:45,940
Madanika, did you see Chandra
Prabha Princes anytime?

570
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,934
No, even our king doesn't know them!

571
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,337
He saw him in their childhood it seems.

572
00:39:59,211 --> 00:40:01,410
Dear Padma, what's the delay?

573
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,421
We don't have time.

574
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:04,982
Chandra Prabha Princes are
coming for the match making.

575
00:40:05,182 --> 00:40:07,819
If you don't wear this
jewelry and dresses fast...

576
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:09,940
Father I don't like it.

577
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,012
You should have told me
once before you invite them.

578
00:40:12,688 --> 00:40:14,696
Yes, I should have told you. But I didn't.

579
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:15,623
It's true.

580
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,788
I'll ask you one thing, will you get
me into a marriage that I don't like?

581
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:19,975
I'll never do that.

582
00:40:20,345 --> 00:40:22,026
But this is just match making!

583
00:40:22,457 --> 00:40:24,863
When I don't like to get married
then what's the use of match making.

584
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:26,215
Yes, it's true.

585
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:30,513
Look dear, as I have given a
word to the king Chandra Prabha,

586
00:40:30,713 --> 00:40:32,615
I invited princes for match making.

587
00:40:32,815 --> 00:40:33,578
They are coming.

588
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:36,728
If we announce that we have cancelled the
match making without any proper reason,

589
00:40:36,928 --> 00:40:39,616
it's very bad to our
status and honor dear.

590
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:44,188
No, let the match making happen, I'll send
them saying that princess didn't like you.

591
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:46,730
Do you think it is honor
to make them come here and raise hopes?

592
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,329
Do you feel that all of this is important?

593
00:40:49,928 --> 00:40:51,308
Tell me. Tell me father.

594
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:52,848
It's confusing.

595
00:40:59,078 --> 00:41:01,681
King,
Chandra Prabha Princes has arrived.

596
00:41:02,142 --> 00:41:03,640
Ah! Have they come?

597
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,034
Have they come here?

598
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:07,419
Err... make them sit there it self.

599
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:10,265
No! No!

600
00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:14,023
Let them inside.

601
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:18,389
It's confusing.

602
00:41:22,134 --> 00:41:23,066
[chuckles]

603
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,246
Tonnes of greetings.

604
00:41:25,598 --> 00:41:26,657
to the king of Kartikeya.

605
00:41:26,865 --> 00:41:27,766
Bless you.

606
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:29,009
Greetings to the king.

607
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:30,768
He is my brother,

608
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:32,631
he believes that villages are most
important assets of the country,

609
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:35,024
and the rural language
is the national language.

610
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:37,288
Making in-depth research
on that language...

611
00:41:37,488 --> 00:41:39,383
Even when he knows forteen languages,

612
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,363
he speaks pure rural language.

613
00:41:41,563 --> 00:41:42,844
[laughs]
Oh great!

614
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:44,638
What a love towards his language.

615
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:47,351
Please take your seats.
[laughs]

616
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:52,750
How is my childhood friend Chandra Prabha?

617
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,398
Yes, he is very much happy.

618
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:56,837
Heck does a king in a
kingdom have a problem with!

619
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,846
If you could call
princess for the match making...

620
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,481
It would take time for princess to come.

621
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,844
As women love to dress up, right?

622
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:10,551
Then call her maid.

623
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:11,506
[chuckles]

624
00:42:11,606 --> 00:42:12,375
It's nothing like that,

625
00:42:12,575 --> 00:42:16,186
my brother's desire is that he
could get to learn any language from them.

626
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:17,337
[laughs]

627
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:19,470
I think it would take
time to my daughter to come.

628
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,071
Will you take rest in the guest room?

629
00:42:22,271 --> 00:42:24,736
Nothing to worry, we will wait
even if it take a lot of time.

630
00:42:25,283 --> 00:42:27,127
I think the inauspicious
time might kick in if it's late.

631
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:29,976
Let it rain,
we will see your daughter after that.

632
00:42:30,683 --> 00:42:31,991
[laughs]

633
00:42:33,763 --> 00:42:36,346
King,
Chandra Prabha Princes are coming.

634
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,701
Both: Greetings to the
king of Kartikeya province.

635
00:42:50,044 --> 00:42:52,030
-Who are you?
-We are the Chandra Prabha Princes.

636
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,216
-Wedding grooms.
-That means bride grooms.

637
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:55,700
We have come as we've got your invitation.

638
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,708
No, we've come on a cart.

639
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,602
Then who are you?

640
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:02,530
-We are the Chandra Prabha Princes.
-Yes.

641
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,929
They look like frauds who
are impersonating us!

642
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:06,088
Both: Huh!

643
00:43:06,288 --> 00:43:07,329
Both: Are we frauds?

644
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:09,157
King!
Are you The King of Kartikeya province?

645
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:10,130
Yes!

646
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:11,947
Then we are the Chandra Prabha Princes.

647
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:20,453
This is a big problem, we should
know who the fraud is and who is true.

648
00:43:20,777 --> 00:43:23,171
Till then there is no match making

649
00:43:24,284 --> 00:43:25,258
Kartikeya King,

650
00:43:25,578 --> 00:43:27,293
make the marriage looks fast

651
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:28,356
That means match making

652
00:43:28,556 --> 00:43:31,646
Till we get to know who is real princes,

653
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:33,414
There won't be any match making

654
00:43:35,658 --> 00:43:38,676
King, Chandra Prabha Princes
are very intelligent.

655
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:40,866
Mistake! They are very intelligent.

656
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:42,285
That means very intelligent fellows.

657
00:43:42,947 --> 00:43:44,121
Then we will ask you few questions,

658
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:45,986
-tell the answers.
-Say the answers.

659
00:43:46,186 --> 00:43:47,531
-Oh
-That means ask.

660
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:49,695
Brother ask them.

661
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:50,742
Then answer dudes!

662
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,221
Once upon a time there was a forest,

663
00:43:53,782 --> 00:43:54,939
there was a palenquin in the forest

664
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:57,155
and a person was going in that palenquin.

665
00:43:57,645 --> 00:43:59,229
You have to rob that person.

666
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:01,649
How? How? How?

667
00:44:02,471 --> 00:44:03,554
-Shall I answer?
-Yes.

668
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:07,431
"Bear the Palenquin! Bear the Palenquin!"

669
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:09,471
Call the Palenquin bearers

670
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:10,907
We will hide beside the way,

671
00:44:11,503 --> 00:44:12,563
jump on it.

672
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,988
We will hit those bearers
and throw them out.

673
00:44:15,617 --> 00:44:18,246
We will pull that person out
and steal the money he has.

674
00:44:18,446 --> 00:44:20,417
-How is it?
-Very nice...

675
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,039
Another question...

676
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:23,071
Ask them, ask them.

677
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:24,483
There is money in the King's palace.

678
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:27,044
-Does he have?
-Yes, he has.

679
00:44:27,244 --> 00:44:28,298
You should rob it.

680
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:31,507
How would you rob? Tell me dudes!

681
00:44:32,073 --> 00:44:33,488
-We will throw ropes on the walls.
-And we will climb up.

682
00:44:33,688 --> 00:44:35,314
-We will enter inside.
-We will enter the treasury

683
00:44:35,514 --> 00:44:37,510
-We'll tie the security.
-Then we will rob the money.

684
00:44:38,071 --> 00:44:39,861
Great! They are saying it correctly.

685
00:44:40,423 --> 00:44:41,283
Last question...

686
00:44:41,734 --> 00:44:43,904
Princess is sitting alone in the garden

687
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:45,213
and you should kidnapp her.

688
00:44:45,413 --> 00:44:46,464
How will you do?

689
00:44:46,664 --> 00:44:48,133
Ah! What's that question?

690
00:44:48,785 --> 00:44:50,048
You wait king, we will answer it.

691
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:52,369
We will pour chilly
powder into eyes of soldiers.

692
00:44:52,789 --> 00:44:54,528
We'll keep cloth in the
mouth of the princess.

693
00:44:54,728 --> 00:44:56,100
And we will escape
with her on our shoulder.

694
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,097
That's it.

695
00:44:57,297 --> 00:45:00,091
Yeah! As everything
they've said are done by thieves,

696
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:02,363
as only the thieves would know them,
these are the thieves!

697
00:45:02,563 --> 00:45:03,183
Both: Oh no!

698
00:45:03,393 --> 00:45:05,619
-King.
-We only answered the questions.

699
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:07,497
-We are not thieves.
-What do you mean by that?

700
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:10,237
King when we were asking those questions,

701
00:45:10,437 --> 00:45:13,263
they should have said 'We are princes!
How could we know?'

702
00:45:13,806 --> 00:45:16,356
but when they are saying how the
thefts are exactly committed...

703
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,120
are they princes or thieves?

704
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,403
King it's been proved
that they are thieves,

705
00:45:20,603 --> 00:45:22,030
we will catch them and punish them.

706
00:45:25,129 --> 00:45:28,621
If we punish them,
they will force me to bring my daughter,

707
00:45:29,004 --> 00:45:30,261
but my daughter wouldn't come.

708
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,248
so...

709
00:45:31,475 --> 00:45:34,584
We will tell both the
parties to rest for today!

710
00:45:36,808 --> 00:45:38,887
King! If you still doubt...

711
00:45:39,087 --> 00:45:40,391
please call the princess once.

712
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:42,351
She will definitely marry me.

713
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:44,346
Even if you call her maid,
she would tell you!

714
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:45,415
Why?

715
00:45:45,681 --> 00:45:48,258
You take rest in different rooms,

716
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:49,709
everything will be proved.

717
00:45:59,096 --> 00:46:00,492
-Vijay, damn!
-Yes?

718
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:03,241
I can see only soldiers wherever I go,

719
00:46:03,832 --> 00:46:05,599
but I can't see my Madanika.

720
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:07,202
Then how could you see your princess?

721
00:46:07,402 --> 00:46:10,339
It's waste that we
have change our attires.

722
00:46:10,633 --> 00:46:11,597
Come on let's go.

723
00:46:11,797 --> 00:46:13,399
Greetings.

724
00:46:13,927 --> 00:46:16,726
King has sent fruits and snacks for you.

725
00:46:17,771 --> 00:46:18,477
Eh!

726
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,523
Oh my Madanika!

727
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:22,245
You are here!

728
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:24,347
-Damn!
-Jasmine flower it's me.

729
00:46:24,547 --> 00:46:25,975
-Your...
-Ah?

730
00:46:26,175 --> 00:46:27,482
Yes, look who he is.

731
00:46:27,682 --> 00:46:28,402
[laughs]

732
00:46:28,602 --> 00:46:30,603
Madanika,
I have to meet Padmavati.

733
00:46:30,881 --> 00:46:32,034
Then I'll go inform her right now.

734
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:34,555
No, without saying that I have come...

735
00:46:35,249 --> 00:46:37,237
-You want it to be fun?
-That's what.

736
00:46:37,437 --> 00:46:38,135
[laughs]

737
00:46:38,577 --> 00:46:41,444
Madanika! Madanika!
After saying this to her,

738
00:46:41,644 --> 00:46:42,938
you come here quickly.

739
00:46:43,274 --> 00:46:44,746
We will have fun here.

740
00:46:45,608 --> 00:46:46,796
What cheeks?

741
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:48,814
They are like jasmine buds.

742
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:49,755
[laughs]

743
00:46:50,651 --> 00:46:52,682
Both: Princess!

744
00:46:52,882 --> 00:46:53,521
Both:Princess!

745
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:55,225
What? What's the nuisance?

746
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,331
What happened?

747
00:46:56,531 --> 00:46:59,750
Nothing madam, Chandra Prabha
prince is coming to see you.

748
00:47:00,407 --> 00:47:01,191
Here?

749
00:47:01,391 --> 00:47:03,784
You are only welcoming him cordially?

750
00:47:03,984 --> 00:47:04,712
Get lost!

751
00:47:04,912 --> 00:47:07,201
Not us madam, the king sent him himself

752
00:47:07,401 --> 00:47:08,799
It's with his permission, he is coming.

753
00:47:09,114 --> 00:47:11,689
Oh! Ok, let him inside.

754
00:47:11,889 --> 00:47:14,938
By seeing this appearance
and behaviour he will marry me.

755
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:16,700
Greeting princess.

756
00:47:17,118 --> 00:47:17,970
May you wed soon!

757
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:19,937
To the Princess of Kartikeya province

758
00:47:20,252 --> 00:47:21,540
Ms. Padmavati

759
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:26,016
Chandra Prabha Prince's
greetings for this meeting!

760
00:47:26,917 --> 00:47:28,045
Ah? Silence?

761
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:29,824
Silence is half acceptance.

762
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:31,769
Aren't you my would-be better half!?

763
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:35,103
Oh!
The Chandra Prabha Prince is quite a poet!

764
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,434
Happy to know that!

765
00:47:36,762 --> 00:47:40,267
But entering into the princess
room without her permission,

766
00:47:40,467 --> 00:47:43,605
you not knowing that is quite sad!

767
00:47:43,926 --> 00:47:45,845
To the one who has entered your heart,

768
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:48,137
would he require
permission to enter this room?

769
00:47:48,337 --> 00:47:51,789
Ah? Pity, the prince is in
the hall of hallucination!

770
00:47:52,189 --> 00:47:53,462
It's not hallucination princess.

771
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:56,530
See me placing a hand on your heart

772
00:47:57,405 --> 00:47:59,944
You will know how safely
I am inside your heart.

773
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:01,274
Enough! Now please leave.

774
00:48:01,474 --> 00:48:03,689
Neither would this match making progress,
nor this wedding would take place

775
00:48:04,253 --> 00:48:06,460
[laughs]

776
00:48:07,401 --> 00:48:08,119
Princess

777
00:48:08,526 --> 00:48:09,727
'What you said is nice..."

778
00:48:10,671 --> 00:48:12,185
and whatever I'm going to say it awesome"

779
00:48:12,385 --> 00:48:13,927
Do I make you say this Princess?

780
00:48:14,712 --> 00:48:16,685
Vijay!
[laughs]

781
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:23,264
Vijay! How did you come here?

782
00:48:23,464 --> 00:48:24,137
[laughs]

783
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:28,688
Few ways and few appearences
are mandatory to meet the Madame!

784
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:30,859
Now I am the prince of
Chandra Prabha kingdom.

785
00:48:31,107 --> 00:48:32,031
The Bride Groom!

786
00:48:32,484 --> 00:48:34,254
If someone sees you or
finds out who you are...

787
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:35,359
Everyone saw me,

788
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:37,284
-Is it?
-Hmm... even they spoke to me.

789
00:48:37,604 --> 00:48:39,234
[chuckles]
When I asked that I want to talk to you

790
00:48:39,554 --> 00:48:40,735
they've shown me the way.

791
00:48:40,935 --> 00:48:44,094
You aren't aware how dangerous such
an adventure is in this palace.

792
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,169
Come, this side.
[laughs]

793
00:48:47,978 --> 00:48:50,396
When there is a love filled flower garden

794
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:54,540
when there is the
moonlight which spreads romance

795
00:48:56,219 --> 00:48:59,425
When there are those
princes who came for you...

796
00:49:00,175 --> 00:49:02,168
don't you want to
enjoy that fun Princess Padmavathi?

797
00:49:02,477 --> 00:49:03,432
[laughs]

798
00:49:06,441 --> 00:49:07,934
Brother! Brother!

799
00:49:08,134 --> 00:49:08,844
Brother South!

800
00:49:09,044 --> 00:49:10,103
Yes, brother North?

801
00:49:10,303 --> 00:49:12,882
The men who claim to be
the Chandra Prabha Princes,

802
00:49:13,143 --> 00:49:13,964
Yes, they came

803
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:15,593
-They claimed that we are thieves...
-Yes.

804
00:49:15,825 --> 00:49:16,787
They are real thieves.

805
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,831
Yes, their beard is not real you know?

806
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:19,937
That means they've kept fake beards.

807
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:21,012
-It's true.
-Is it?

808
00:49:21,212 --> 00:49:22,463
It's as true as we don't have beards.

809
00:49:22,819 --> 00:49:25,121
Then we should
immediaitly inform this to the king.

810
00:49:25,321 --> 00:49:26,494
-Yes, we should.
-Come on, brother North.

811
00:49:26,694 --> 00:49:27,246
-Come on.
-This way.

812
00:49:30,394 --> 00:49:31,260
Hey! Hey!

813
00:49:31,682 --> 00:49:33,140
Where are you going? Come down!

814
00:49:33,712 --> 00:49:34,351
Come!

815
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:38,256
You can't enter without permission and you
wouldn't get permission without entering.

816
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:39,761
What is this confusion man?

817
00:49:39,961 --> 00:49:42,093
This is the ritual of this kingdom.
Come on.

818
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:46,690
By the way, what do you want?

819
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,007
We want to tell the king that the ones who
called us thieves are the real thieves

820
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:52,064
But it's you who look like thieves!

821
00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:54,452
Why would we be like that?
We are the wedding grooms.

822
00:49:54,652 --> 00:49:55,537
-What?
-We are Bride Grooms.

823
00:49:55,816 --> 00:49:57,304
At the same time, two more persons...

824
00:49:57,504 --> 00:50:00,109
Arrived with fake beards
and are cheating the king.

825
00:50:00,743 --> 00:50:03,168
How do you know that
their beards are fake?

826
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:04,238
Did you go to shave them?

827
00:50:04,529 --> 00:50:06,725
-Hey, mind your words.
-Do you know who we are?

828
00:50:07,195 --> 00:50:10,018
Show me how do you know that
their beards are fake?

829
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:14,215
First there was beard, then there
was no beard, again there was beard.

830
00:50:14,415 --> 00:50:14,980
Both: Yes.

831
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,150
-I think you have an eye problem!
-It's for my dad.

832
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,623
It's not a contigious disease
and won't spread to us.

833
00:50:18,898 --> 00:50:22,352
Okay. First show me that their
beards aren't real,

834
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,110
once I believe it, you can tell the king.

835
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:25,859
-Is this the ritual of the kingdom too?
-Yes.

836
00:50:26,514 --> 00:50:28,490
Do you know what's the
punishment if you can't prove?

837
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,518
Both: What's that?

838
00:50:29,801 --> 00:50:30,777
Slash!
[gasps]

839
00:50:31,684 --> 00:50:33,783
-Brother North!
-Still needn't fear...

840
00:50:34,177 --> 00:50:34,857
We will prove it.

841
00:51:01,621 --> 00:51:05,777
"An incident of deep love
and an excellent act put up"

842
00:51:06,077 --> 00:51:08,839
"Both suited well!"

843
00:51:09,687 --> 00:51:12,903
"Now it's just the happiness that awaits"

844
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,582
"Know the truth young beauty"

845
00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:18,787
"An incident of deep love
and an excellent act put up"

846
00:51:18,987 --> 00:51:22,102
"It spread happiness"

847
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:25,608
"My beauty is yours now"

848
00:51:26,236 --> 00:51:27,612
"Everything would be unveiled now"

849
00:51:58,539 --> 00:52:02,312
"The one you like has paired
with you at the right time"

850
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:05,091
"The auspicious time is here!"

851
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:11,031
"The beautiful youth has come to you"

852
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,741
"The heart has heard the message"

853
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:19,940
"Put aside any doubts in your heart, girl"

854
00:52:20,278 --> 00:52:24,292
"Enjoy this tender gift you've got"

855
00:52:24,492 --> 00:52:28,866
"Oh beauty! My dear sweet girl,
the right time has come!"

856
00:52:29,066 --> 00:52:33,002
"An incident of deep love
and an excellent act put up"

857
00:52:33,418 --> 00:52:36,433
"It spread happiness"

858
00:52:36,962 --> 00:52:40,014
"My beauty is yours now"

859
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:41,991
"Everything would be unveiled now"

860
00:53:12,594 --> 00:53:16,400
"All my wishes came true,
my body dances in the air"

861
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:19,179
"With the love in place now"

862
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:25,303
"Today,
when your mate is here for romance"

863
00:53:25,623 --> 00:53:27,882
"Pleasure starts"

864
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:33,989
"Do I make a garland of
all the sweet topics?"

865
00:53:34,457 --> 00:53:38,315
"I'd come in a jiffy to
wed the royal beauty!"

866
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:43,061
"I melted into a lovely rainfall with
every bit of me turning into a rain drop"

867
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:47,105
"An incident of deep love
and an excellent act put up"

868
00:53:47,568 --> 00:53:50,328
"Both suited well!"

869
00:53:51,176 --> 00:53:54,032
"Now it's just the happiness that awaits"

870
00:53:54,593 --> 00:53:56,132
"Know the truth young beauty"

871
00:53:56,332 --> 00:54:00,196
"An incident of deep love
and an excellent act put up"

872
00:54:00,645 --> 00:54:03,890
"It spread happiness"

873
00:54:04,212 --> 00:54:07,145
"My beauty is yours now"

874
00:54:07,628 --> 00:54:09,321
"Everything would be unveiled now"

875
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:29,141
[sneezes]

876
00:54:30,512 --> 00:54:31,428
Damn!

877
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:41,721
Padma! Padma!

878
00:54:43,094 --> 00:54:43,877
What is this?

879
00:54:44,077 --> 00:54:44,733
Beard.

880
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:45,944
I know but whose?

881
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,217
How does it matter?

882
00:54:47,453 --> 00:54:50,363
She has forgotten her status and
is romancing with that village guy.

883
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:51,521
Why don't you ask about that?

884
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,181
-Oh! I should ask this right?
-Ask her brother-in-law.

885
00:54:53,381 --> 00:54:57,934
Ask her how can that forest man come into
the palace after I set so much security!

886
00:54:58,141 --> 00:54:59,357
Oh I should ask this too right?

887
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,886
Padma, what is this dear?

888
00:55:02,086 --> 00:55:03,057
Forgive me father.

889
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:06,531
I can't hide my feelings
once the matter came so far

890
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,312
I am in love with Vijay.

891
00:55:08,512 --> 00:55:09,905
I want to marry him.

892
00:55:10,954 --> 00:55:12,627
Did you see? Did you see her arrogence?

893
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:13,792
Look how she is talking?

894
00:55:13,992 --> 00:55:16,580
That is why I told you,
to get her married with my brother.

895
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,056
Did you care for my words? Did you?

896
00:55:18,256 --> 00:55:20,431
-I do care now!
-Then fix the dates immediately!

897
00:55:22,968 --> 00:55:24,378
Why she is asking me to fix the dates?

898
00:55:24,578 --> 00:55:26,526
Dates should be fixed by the priest!

899
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:27,840
Huh!

King what are those screams?

903
00:55:41,655 --> 00:55:42,910
I think wolves are howling.

904
00:55:43,454 --> 00:55:45,371
Why would the wolves howl near the palace?

905
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:47,623
This looks like a bad omen to me

906
00:55:47,823 --> 00:55:48,757
I am afraid.

What's this horrible happening Minister?

910
00:56:06,044 --> 00:56:08,423
How did the royal elephant
break out suddenly?

911
00:56:09,017 --> 00:56:10,640
Suddenly wolves were howling in the night.

912
00:56:11,196 --> 00:56:12,663
When we were afraid of that bad omen!

913
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:15,615
-this Elephant resorted to destruction.
-You and your superstitions sis!

914
00:56:15,815 --> 00:56:17,364
Wolves, Elephants and bad omen....

915
00:56:17,433 --> 00:56:19,662
Surya Varma! Your feelings are modern.

916
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:22,299
You won't understand
this omens and evil now.

917
00:56:22,499 --> 00:56:26,007
Leave it. I am afraid what and
how would be the results...

918
00:56:26,207 --> 00:56:27,347
No need to be afraid queen.

919
00:56:27,547 --> 00:56:31,435
If we conduct prayers and Yagas in
temples, these bad omens would fade out

920
00:56:31,635 --> 00:56:34,702
Then start the prayers in every temple.

921
00:56:34,902 --> 00:56:36,212
Conduct Yagas!

922
00:56:36,412 --> 00:56:37,344

Oh golden coloured eternal beauty!
You've come from a long distance.

943
01:01:14,717 --> 01:01:16,381
Your heart should get pure.

944
01:01:16,826 --> 01:01:18,789
You should go around the holy flames

945
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:41,495
Princess, with a clean heart,
having no other thoughts

946
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:43,291
you should see the great goddess

947

Oh mother! Oh giver of all powers!

950

I've prayed to you since many years

951
01:02:04,504 --> 01:02:06,664
You've blessed me with a lot of powers

952

To get all the powers and to
be the lord of the universe

953

I've summoned this unmarried
beauty as per your command

I'll come agian on the next full moon day,

[chants]

968
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,300
You should reach your
place before the moon vanishes

969
01:03:00,795 --> 01:03:02,966
And you should be ready to
come on the next full moon day.

Now all the worlds would be under me!

-Tell me dear.
-Tell me dear.

989
01:04:29,885 --> 01:04:32,484
Mother... last night...

990
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:36,022
Someone took me some where.

991
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:39,504
What someone took you somewhere?

992
01:04:40,138 --> 01:04:42,398
Last night from the palace?

993
01:04:42,598 --> 01:04:43,826
It might be a bad dream dear.

994
01:04:44,121 --> 01:04:46,454
-It's not real.
-That is...

995
01:04:47,156 --> 01:04:49,971
It's a reality like dream
and a dream like reality.

996
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,994
Tell me what actually happened dear.
Tell me dear.

997
01:04:54,374 --> 01:04:57,604
A dangerous shape...
it's a different place.

998
01:04:58,709 --> 01:05:02,540
In that place there is fire...

999
01:05:03,106 --> 01:05:05,834
I can't tell it properly.

1000
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:08,120
I can't remember properly.

1001
01:05:09,269 --> 01:05:12,276
There is some big statue.

1002
01:05:13,152 --> 01:05:15,631
Very dangerous...

1003
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:18,866

-Padma!
-Padma!

1005
01:05:28,515 --> 01:05:30,679
Doctor, what have you decided?

1006
01:05:31,299 --> 01:05:33,181
Her health is alright king.

1007
01:05:33,746 --> 01:05:37,782
No sign of fever.
Pulse rate and blood flow is also fine.

1008
01:05:38,222 --> 01:05:40,857
Except she might have gone
unconcious because of fear,

1009
01:05:41,153 --> 01:05:42,471
but there is no sign of disease.

1010
01:05:43,251 --> 01:05:45,140
Can you assume what actually happened?

1011
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:50,136
Black magic and witch crafts
do work on humans, my king.

1012
01:05:50,735 --> 01:05:53,695
If something happened to
her as she explained...

1013
01:05:53,895 --> 01:05:57,121
Why has the one doing the black
magic choose only our daughter?

1014
01:05:57,512 --> 01:06:00,380
Who he is? I can't understand anything.

1015
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:03,833
I understood brother-in-law,
the reason is...

1016
01:06:04,033 --> 01:06:06,382
the one who is coming secrectly
and torturing us trapping Padma,

1017
01:06:06,582 --> 01:06:07,805
that forest man Vijay.

1018
01:06:08,168 --> 01:06:10,750
Only the persons who roam around the
forests would know such black magic.

1019
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:12,856
Then why think Soora Varma?

1020
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:15,140
Wherever he is, imprison
him and bring him here.

Your son? Then tell me where is he?

1028

[groans]

1061
01:10:05,223 --> 01:10:08,433
Say it atleast now, what conspiracy
have you spun on our princess?

1062
01:10:08,633 --> 01:10:10,802
I am saying it again I
don't understand anything.

1063
01:10:11,311 --> 01:10:12,228
You won't,

1064
01:10:12,543 --> 01:10:14,788
you will have to face the
whip lashes until you say the truth

1065
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:15,680
Huh!

1066
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:19,832
[groans]

1067
01:10:26,468 --> 01:10:32,415
[chains rattling]

1068
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:08,795
You aren't telling the truth even
after getting beaten black and blue

1069
01:11:09,564 --> 01:11:11,723
Now tell me, who are you?

1070
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:13,638
What is your real form?

1071
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:18,034
What are you planning to do by
taking my one and only daughter?

1072
01:11:19,106 --> 01:11:19,964
Tell me man!

1073
01:11:21,164 --> 01:11:26,482
I don't have a habit of saying different
things to diiferent people king.

1074
01:11:27,888 --> 01:11:29,270
I'm saying the same thing now too.

1075
01:11:30,148 --> 01:11:33,116
I can't understand what is my crime

1076
01:11:33,572 --> 01:11:36,540
You are casting your
black magic on my daughter,

1077
01:11:36,997 --> 01:11:38,573
for what you are doing?

1078
01:11:39,173 --> 01:11:41,667
Black magic and me?

1079
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:44,942
On the princess who I
love with my whole heart,

1080
01:11:46,076 --> 01:11:47,669
am I performing black magic?

1081
01:11:47,869 --> 01:11:50,592
Loving with your whole heart?
[chuckles]

1082
01:11:51,358 --> 01:11:53,994
Why are you acting that you
are in love with that innocent?

1083
01:11:54,194 --> 01:11:56,632
We know why are you trying to trap her.

1084
01:11:57,457 --> 01:11:59,351
What's your plan and your betrayal is,

1085
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:02,089
princess Padmavathi
has told us everything.

1086
01:12:02,289 --> 01:12:03,596
-Padmavathi?
-Yes.

1087
01:12:04,164 --> 01:12:06,131
You came on the night of full moon day,

1088
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:09,508
and took her to some dangerous
place by spreading sleeping gas...

1089
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:10,893
What did you say?

1090
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:15,177
Padmavathi who loves me more than
anything in this world will never say that

1091
01:12:15,482 --> 01:12:16,520
Not even for fun!

1092
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,766
King, I know Padmavathi's heart.

1093
01:12:20,353 --> 01:12:24,592
To make me hate Padmavathi, they are
cooking up stories and blaming me!

1094
01:12:24,785 --> 01:12:27,881
King!
Without wasting time with your vague talks

1095
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:29,300
put him in prison.

1096
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,010
Prison is not enough for him,
he should be hanged.

1097
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:34,250
Just give me the permission,
I'll make it happen immideately.

1098
01:12:34,562 --> 01:12:35,671
Don't make haste king!

1099
01:12:36,254 --> 01:12:38,798
Our problem would not be
solved if we hang him

1100
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:42,655
We should know the people
behind him and their aim.

1101
01:12:42,915 --> 01:12:44,417
Then we should destroy them completely.

1102
01:12:44,789 --> 01:12:45,806
It's true Minister.

1103
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:47,749
But this isn't the right time for that.

1104
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:50,980
It's important how to
save my daughter's life first.

1105
01:12:54,868 --> 01:12:58,437
At least tell me the truth now,
what's my daughter's sin?

1106
01:12:58,953 --> 01:13:01,380
Torture us or curse us if you need to.

1107
01:13:02,027 --> 01:13:03,117
I'll give whatever you want.

1108
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:05,970
But don't take my Padma's life.

1109
01:13:06,868 --> 01:13:11,506
Already she is bed ridden with a disease
which even doctors couldn't detect,

1110
01:13:11,733 --> 01:13:14,138
Ah! Is my Padmavathi on death bed?

1111
01:13:14,915 --> 01:13:15,693
Padma!

1112
01:13:19,694 --> 01:13:21,117
What are you looking at?
Catch him!

1113
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:22,836
[chains rattling]

1114
01:13:36,373 --> 01:13:39,670
Padma! Padma!

1115
01:13:41,915 --> 01:13:42,803
Padma!

1116
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:48,099
Vijay!

1117
01:13:48,813 --> 01:13:49,617
Padma!

1118
01:13:50,378 --> 01:13:52,203
Vijay! What is all this?

1119
01:13:52,931 --> 01:13:54,227
Who tortured you in this way?

1120
01:13:54,796 --> 01:13:57,482
Padma! They say some black
magic is torturing you...

1121
01:13:58,448 --> 01:14:00,407
The King suspects me that
I have done all this...

1122
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:02,430
and punished me like this.

1123
01:14:03,365 --> 01:14:04,417
What actually happened Padma!

1124
01:14:06,292 --> 01:14:10,127
Last full moon day night,
some strange power came to me,

1125
01:14:11,099 --> 01:14:13,548
and took me to a very dangerous place.

1126
01:14:13,844 --> 01:14:17,766
There I saw a dangerous statue.

1127
01:14:19,025 --> 01:14:20,085
and a fierce looking man.

1128
01:14:20,597 --> 01:14:24,056
Vijay, I have a life threaton
the coming full moon day.

1129
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:27,441
Princess! Princess! Soldiers!

1130
01:14:27,641 --> 01:14:30,774
Padma...
no one can harm you until I am alive.

1131
01:14:31,294 --> 01:14:32,550
I'll find out what is that evil power is.

1132
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,143
I shall leave.

1133
01:14:34,501 --> 01:14:35,088
There he is!

1134
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:36,603
Vijay!

1135
01:14:44,742 --> 01:14:46,074
[horse neighs]

1136
01:14:55,448 --> 01:14:56,431
[horse neighs]

1137
01:15:22,963 --> 01:15:24,167
Our guy has escaped!

1138
01:15:30,648 --> 01:15:31,580
[horse neighs]

1139
01:15:48,012 --> 01:15:48,877
[horse neighs]

1140
01:15:58,413 --> 01:15:59,667
[horse snorting]

1141
01:16:16,567 --> 01:16:18,122
[horse snorting]

1142
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:29,290
[horse neighs]

1143
01:16:37,818 --> 01:16:38,283
Oh no!

1144
01:16:44,211 --> 01:16:44,759
Oh god!

1145
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:47,815
We will take him to the Ashram.

1146
01:16:51,168 --> 01:16:54,185
Mother,
Vijay is escaping from the soldiers.

1147
01:16:54,385 --> 01:16:55,492
We saw it with our own eyes.

1148
01:16:55,781 --> 01:16:58,307
-Say it man!
-Yes, he was riding a horse.

1149
01:16:59,201 --> 01:17:01,459
Why don't you bring him
home if you saw everything?

1150
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:04,359
Why do you want him here?
For the soldiers to arrest him again?

1151
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:07,341
He will be safe anywhere but here.

1152
01:17:07,425 --> 01:17:08,385
That's what!

1153
01:17:08,901 --> 01:17:10,380
Vijay is talented.

1154
01:17:10,599 --> 01:17:13,977
Mother, he will be fine if
you stop worrying about him.

1155
01:17:14,036 --> 01:17:14,563
Exactly.

1156
01:17:19,063 --> 01:17:19,762
Mother...

1157
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:29,497
Dear, how are you feeling now?

1158
01:17:33,709 --> 01:17:37,198
Mother, you seem like a goddess.

1159
01:17:38,243 --> 01:17:39,879
You've treated me with motherly love.

1160
01:17:41,171 --> 01:17:44,869
You are staying in this tranquil
environment. Who are you, mother?

1161
01:17:45,331 --> 01:17:47,360
Son, this is the monastery
of the great hermit Jamadagni.

1162
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:49,553
What happened to you?

1163
01:17:50,435 --> 01:17:51,630
Who has hurt you?

1164
01:17:52,358 --> 01:17:55,849
We don't know what happened to the
people who went to bring that vicious.

1165
01:17:56,431 --> 01:17:58,403
We don't know to which side they fled.

1166
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:01,888
The astrologers said that our daughter
will be in danger on every full moon day.

1167
01:18:02,137 --> 01:18:03,331
Full moon day is nearby.

1168
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:06,046
Sooravarma,
what were you doing till now then?

1169
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:08,876
I've sent the soldiers to
every corner for that vicious guy!

1170
01:18:09,143 --> 01:18:11,899
I asked them to bring the dead
body if he isn't caught alive.

1171
01:18:12,312 --> 01:18:13,837
By the time you kill him,

1172
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,774
that wizard will turn into
a mosquito or in a fly

1173
01:18:16,913 --> 01:18:18,968
and kidnap the girl by
entering into the palace.

1174
01:18:19,483 --> 01:18:22,983
Did he find our innocent girl to trap?

1175
01:18:23,845 --> 01:18:27,014
What might be the bad deeds in our past
lives that he is harassing our girl.

1176
01:18:27,575 --> 01:18:28,119
Calm down.

1177
01:18:28,591 --> 01:18:32,276
Minister, we shouldn't care about
this Sooravarma's trials,

1178
01:18:32,722 --> 01:18:35,312
but we should perform an exorcism.

1179
01:18:35,889 --> 01:18:38,827
Summon all the seers from
the different countries.

1180
01:18:39,665 --> 01:18:41,389
But mother,
it's the only thing which is troubling me.

1181
01:18:42,073 --> 01:18:45,539
The astrologers said that the princess
has a life danger on every full moon day,

1182
01:18:45,927 --> 01:18:48,432
An evil power is torturing
her as they said.

1183
01:18:48,755 --> 01:18:53,129
Mother, I should somehow save
the princess before the full moon.

1184
01:18:54,073 --> 01:18:56,492
I regained my strength with your support.

1185
01:18:57,171 --> 01:18:58,159
Let me take leave.

1186
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:02,044
Son,
you are leaving to oppose evil powers.

1187
01:19:02,857 --> 01:19:05,097
Take the blessings of
that Goddess Vajreshwari.

1188
01:19:05,813 --> 01:19:07,024
Victory will be yours.

1189
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,343
[water burbling]

1190
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,791
Mother of all,
oh merciful Goddess,

1191
01:19:13,194 --> 01:19:16,324
protect your devotees by supporting
them all the time.

1192
01:19:22,902 --> 01:19:25,122
Son, this is a blessing of
Goddess Vajreshwari Devi.

1193
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:30,107
Evil powers cannot harm you until
you have this divine guard.

1194
01:19:38,788 --> 01:19:43,289
Son,
don't remove this guard no matter what.

1195
01:19:44,599 --> 01:19:48,891
Mother, I've got yours and
that Goddess's blessings.

1196
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:50,005
What else do I need?

1197
01:19:51,131 --> 01:19:53,032
I'll find out the evil
power and oppose it.

1198
01:19:53,843 --> 01:19:54,551
I'll leave now.

1199
01:19:57,795 --> 01:19:59,874
Take care, son.
Be careful.

1200
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:01,060
Alright, mother.

1201
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:13,953

1205
01:20:57,683 --> 01:20:58,212
Hey!

1206

01:24:50,247 --> 01:24:51,519
Victory to you, warrior!

1212
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,867
I'm a nymph.

1213
01:24:55,326 --> 01:24:56,176
Don't doubt.

1214
01:24:56,513 --> 01:25:01,376
I'm residing in front of a witches'
cave because of a sage's curse.

1215
01:25:01,731 --> 01:25:03,691
You have freed me from the curse.

1216
01:25:04,925 --> 01:25:08,988
Oh brave one! The wizard is
going to offer the girl you love.

1217
01:25:10,069 --> 01:25:11,072
But mind this warning.

1218
01:25:11,868 --> 01:25:15,646
You might dare and face the wizard,
but this is not the right time.

1219
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:19,892
Take this ring.

1220
01:25:24,823 --> 01:25:27,494
You can control that bed with its help.

1221
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:29,727
Take the princess and
leave as soon as possible.

1222
01:25:30,647 --> 01:25:31,221
I'm indebted.

1223
01:25:31,605 --> 01:25:32,305
Victory be with you

[satanic chanting continues]

1226
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:30,026
The time is approaching.

1227
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:33,016
Take a head bath in the
south-eastern pond.

1228
01:26:34,045 --> 01:26:35,623
Should wear the sacrificial dress

1229
01:26:36,417 --> 01:26:37,618
and should return back soon.

1233
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:13,811
Padma... Padma...

1234
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,464
Vijay, where are we?

1235
01:27:17,559 --> 01:27:19,816
I will tell you all later.
First, come with me.

1236
01:27:20,367 --> 01:27:26,293
[satanic chanting continues]

1237
01:27:35,733 --> 01:27:38,445
[evil laughs]

1238
01:27:38,871 --> 01:27:40,975
Your plan has been spolied.

1239
01:27:41,326 --> 01:27:43,260
The bed has fled.

1240
01:27:45,583 --> 01:27:46,506
Hey!

1241
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:48,955
[satanic spell]

1242
01:27:50,821 --> 01:27:53,345
[laughs] Your spell won't work anymore.

1243
01:27:53,497 --> 01:27:54,483
[satanic spell]

1244
01:27:56,157 --> 01:27:57,865
That bed won't return.

1245
01:28:02,126 --> 01:28:06,497
Bhairava Dweepa's saviour...
[satanic chants]

1246
01:28:06,577 --> 01:28:12,415
[water burbling]

1247
01:28:15,909 --> 01:28:17,820
[evil grunts]

1248
01:28:17,937 --> 01:28:19,850
Eat the boy by opposing,
torturing and stabbing who took away

1249
01:28:19,941 --> 01:28:23,642
the woman by entering into the temple.

1250
01:28:23,756 --> 01:28:28,162
Bring the woman here by holding
with your teeth. [grunts]

1251
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:32,665
That wizard would've sacrificed
me if you hadn't come on time.

1252
01:28:32,954 --> 01:28:35,261
You need not worry anymore.
We have escaped.

1253
01:28:39,994 --> 01:28:42,449
[bird screams] [gasps]
Vijay...

1254
01:28:42,827 --> 01:28:44,009
Some evil bird.

1255
01:28:44,498 --> 01:28:47,349
[bird screams]

1256
01:28:48,492 --> 01:28:49,612
That wizard might've sent it.

1257
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:51,250
You be brave.

1258
01:28:54,205 --> 01:29:00,196
[grunts] [screams]
Vijay...

1259
01:29:06,762 --> 01:29:12,169
[grunts continously]

1260
01:29:17,843 --> 01:29:18,531
Vijay...

1261
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:07,209
[wind howling]
[bird screams]

1262
01:30:11,859 --> 01:30:14,268
[grunts]
[gasps]

1263
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:21,089
[bird screams]

1264
01:30:27,374 --> 01:30:29,596
[screams]
Vijay...

1265
01:30:30,139 --> 01:30:33,586
[thud]
[indistinct voices]

1266
01:30:33,786 --> 01:30:38,233
Oh no...
[indistinct voices]

1267
01:30:38,452 --> 01:30:39,501
[bird screams]

1268
01:30:41,057 --> 01:30:42,010
[groans]

1269
01:30:42,844 --> 01:30:45,359
Vijay...
[thud]

1270
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:25,645
[shouts]
Vijay...

1271
01:31:27,206 --> 01:31:28,228
Vijay...

1272
01:31:45,409 --> 01:31:46,112
Vijay...

1273
01:31:48,467 --> 01:31:49,247
Vijay...

1274
01:31:51,201 --> 01:31:51,863
Vijay...

1275
01:31:53,695 --> 01:31:55,298
Padma, you don't worry.

1276
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,545
This bed will make you reach safely.

1277
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:39,549
[groans]

1278
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:55,527
[bird screams]
[collapse]

1279
01:32:56,601 --> 01:32:58,324
Father, what is use of regretting now?

1280
01:32:58,938 --> 01:33:01,535
You all have suspected Vijay
without minding my words.

1281
01:33:02,127 --> 01:33:04,636
You've blamed and accused
the adventurous hero,

1282
01:33:04,976 --> 01:33:06,144
who saved my life by putting his life.

1283
01:33:07,065 --> 01:33:09,373
I don't know where Vijay is now
and in which condition he is.

1284
01:33:16,402 --> 01:33:20,530
[footsteps arriving]

1285
01:33:20,672 --> 01:33:22,571
-Wow!
-Wow!

1286
01:33:22,771 --> 01:33:25,107
-A male man!
-He has washed ashore.

1287
01:33:25,307 --> 01:33:26,778
Poor guy!
He is drenched.

1288
01:33:27,129 --> 01:33:28,576
Let's shift him to a dry place.

1289
01:33:30,284 --> 01:33:31,553
Let's change his wet clothes.

1290
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:33,268
[laughing]

1291
01:33:33,456 --> 01:33:34,754
Let's tease him.

1292
01:33:34,934 --> 01:33:36,343
Let's play with him.

1293
01:33:37,304 --> 01:33:43,206
[laughing]

1294
01:33:44,334 --> 01:33:45,145
Hey!
Who is that?

1295
01:33:45,487 --> 01:33:48,642
Dare to face me and hit
but don't hit while hiding.

1296
01:33:48,842 --> 01:33:49,934
We will not face you.

1297
01:33:50,153 --> 01:33:52,237
Guess us.

1298
01:33:52,438 --> 01:33:54,628
Catch us if you can.

1299
01:33:54,761 --> 01:34:00,748
[footsteps leaving]

1300
01:34:08,169 --> 01:34:11,115
[indistinct voices]
Leave us...

1301
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:12,156
Who are you?

1302
01:34:12,256 --> 01:34:13,448
We are naughty devils.

1303
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:16,174
-We are naughty devils.
-We are naughty husband and wife.

1304
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:17,226
Naughty devils?

1305
01:34:18,023 --> 01:34:21,528
You are brave as you didn't
run away by seeing us.

1306
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:23,980
You are capable to help us.

1307
01:34:24,493 --> 01:34:25,237
What is that help?

1308
01:34:25,568 --> 01:34:28,965
We are the devils in
the Bhairava's cave.

1309
01:34:29,605 --> 01:34:32,001
-Bhairava?
-Yeah, do you know him?

1310
01:34:32,499 --> 01:34:34,758
He is the vicious one who tried
to sacrifice my girlfriend.

1311
01:34:34,858 --> 01:34:38,152
He was angry at us since we asked
him to stop such activities.

1312
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:41,920
And then he threw us in this
desert by tightening us in a jar.

1313
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:46,015
While we were suffocating
in that jar for years,

1314
01:34:46,438 --> 01:34:48,644
a blindman has come to this desert.

1315
01:35:01,685 --> 01:35:07,356
[laughing]

1316
01:35:08,584 --> 01:35:10,696
Oh, brave man!

1317
01:35:10,751 --> 01:35:12,694
Oh, saviour!

1318
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:17,042
-Who is that?
-We are naughty devils...

1319
01:35:17,142 --> 01:35:18,893
We are naughty husband and wife.

1320
01:35:19,604 --> 01:35:22,970
Dear helper! You've released us
from the jar after so many days.

1321
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:24,092
Ask us what you want.

1322
01:35:24,366 --> 01:35:28,958
Helping the one who helped us is
our devils' family tradition.

1323
01:35:29,101 --> 01:35:30,347
-Isn't it?
-Yeah.

1324
01:35:30,622 --> 01:35:32,990
I'm starving...

1325
01:35:33,272 --> 01:35:35,785
I'm starving since many days.

1326
01:35:36,370 --> 01:35:37,365
Give me something to eat.

1327
01:35:37,699 --> 01:35:38,975
Oh!
Is it just that?

1328
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:42,206
[laughing]

1329
01:35:42,472 --> 01:35:44,244
-Have it.
-Have your stomach full.

1330
01:35:47,923 --> 01:35:50,050
Fruits... Fruits...

1331
01:35:50,693 --> 01:35:51,641
Delicious foods...

1332
01:36:03,262 --> 01:36:08,000
[wind howling]

1333
01:36:32,437 --> 01:36:33,341
Oh wicked one!

1334
01:36:33,761 --> 01:36:37,250
How dare you to eat food by entering
into my favourite God Tumbura's temple?

1335
01:36:37,655 --> 01:36:39,816
You have desecrated this temple of music.

1336
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:41,759
Tumbura God's temple of music?

1337
01:36:42,613 --> 01:36:47,777
Forgive me.
I couldn't see the pedestal as I am blind.

1338
01:36:48,246 --> 01:36:50,276
This mistake of yours is unforgivable.

1339
01:36:50,653 --> 01:36:52,981
I'll make sure to keep
you starve for life long.

1340
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:57,099
From then, we gave him food everyday...

1341
01:36:57,207 --> 01:36:58,187
and the horse came and kicked.

1342
01:36:58,362 --> 01:37:00,529
-We gave him food,
-And the horse came and kicked.

1343
01:37:00,729 --> 01:37:01,452
Poor fellow!

1344
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:06,071
We are unable to make him eat
some food and return his favour.

1345
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:07,890
As you are adventurous,

1346
01:37:08,045 --> 01:37:12,880
if you trap the horse
and make him eat food,

1347
01:37:13,057 --> 01:37:14,198
we will leave.

1348
01:37:15,595 --> 01:37:18,739
Alright, I will try as you wish.

1349
01:37:19,998 --> 01:37:21,059
Well done brave guy!

1350
01:37:22,664 --> 01:37:27,297
[laughs] That blind man is in
that Tumbura's temple. Take this.

1351
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:44,880
Sir

1352
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:47,668
Get up

1353
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,082
and have some food.

1354
01:37:52,138 --> 01:37:52,987
Who are you?

1355
01:37:53,737 --> 01:37:54,821
How does it matter?

1356
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:55,927
Have the food.

1357
01:38:02,501 --> 01:38:04,292
No, I don't want.

1358
01:38:04,887 --> 01:38:05,886
I don't deserve.

1359
01:38:07,766 --> 01:38:11,051
The sins and evils that I
have committed are afflicted me.

1360
01:38:11,758 --> 01:38:14,298
Let me starve to death.

1361
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:17,110
Sir, don't feel nervous.

1362
01:38:17,643 --> 01:38:18,184
[gasps]

1363
01:38:20,448 --> 01:38:22,561
[wind howling]

1364
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:28,720
[horse gallops]

1365
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:31,075
Hold on, Pegasus.

1366
01:38:32,804 --> 01:38:36,300
[sighs] He is a blind man.
He didn't commit the mistake knowingly.

1367
01:38:36,645 --> 01:38:39,168
Anyway don't you have
any other way to punish him?

1368
01:38:39,663 --> 01:38:41,362
Why are you interrupting
him from having food?

1369
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:43,714
Who the hell are you to teach me?

1370
01:38:43,989 --> 01:38:46,703
Even you might face the same
situation if you talk more!

1371
01:38:47,003 --> 01:38:47,835
Forgive me, Pegasus.

1372
01:38:51,001 --> 01:38:55,526
Tumbura, whom you worship is the
man behind the origin of Samaveda.

1373
01:38:56,405 --> 01:38:58,904
Peace and love is the meaning of music.

1374
01:38:59,596 --> 01:39:03,529
How dare you speak about the vast
music which you aren't aware of?

1375
01:39:03,865 --> 01:39:05,259
What do you know about it, silly human?

1376
01:39:05,849 --> 01:39:07,315
Everything is known to you.

1377
01:39:08,212 --> 01:39:12,674
With the music, the fire will flare,
the clouds will rain, trees will sprout.

1378
01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:15,498
Infact the God himself will present.

1379
01:39:15,708 --> 01:39:20,032
Is an act of violence in such a
holy place of music righteous?

1380
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:24,079
If it so, do you have the power to make
this temple bells ring with your music?

1381
01:39:24,505 --> 01:39:26,983
Everything is possible
with your blessings.

Forgive his mistake made in blindness.

I'm requesting you to give him sight.

1433

Let that happen then

Oh, master singer! Your wish is selfless.

01:45:26,773 --> 01:45:30,026
Im happy,
I'm offering a boon to you too.

1437
01:45:30,331 --> 01:45:31,776
Whenever the route is tough

1438

and you have to go to an
unfamiliar destination,

1439
01:45:35,666 --> 01:45:39,013
I'll take you there, upon remembering me.

1440

A great boon!

1441
01:45:53,797 --> 01:45:54,437
Son.

1442
01:45:57,225 --> 01:46:01,963
I don't know who are you but
I'm feeling glad by seeing you.

1443
01:46:03,035 --> 01:46:04,186
You are not an ordinary person.

1444
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:07,691
How can I return your favour?

[laughing]

1446
01:46:17,539 --> 01:46:21,211
Thank God! Now your hunger is
fulfilled and our debt too.

1447
01:46:21,435 --> 01:46:22,145
Yeah, yeah.

1448
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:27,075
Adventurer, we should do a
favour to you for helping us.

1449
01:46:27,633 --> 01:46:32,084
I want only one thing. I should protect my
girlfriend from the occult of that wizard.

1450
01:46:32,462 --> 01:46:33,922
Oh! Is it just that?

1451
01:46:33,995 --> 01:46:38,236
Look adventurer, if you travel towards
east side after crossing this desert,

1452
01:46:38,537 --> 01:46:41,035
there will be a world named
Yakshini Loka (Fairy world).

1453
01:46:41,095 --> 01:46:45,284
There is a powerful necklace
called Shata-Ratna in that world.

1454
01:46:45,977 --> 01:46:49,900
If you make the princess wear that
necklace around her neck,

1455
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,407
that wizard's powers will
not work before that.

1456
01:46:53,486 --> 01:46:55,212
It's a victory for you.

1457
01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:56,969
We will leave now.

1458
01:46:57,169 --> 01:46:58,049
Tring... Tring...!

1459
01:46:58,542 --> 01:47:02,074
[laughing]

1460
01:47:03,695 --> 01:47:05,729
Son, you leave now.

1461
01:47:06,245 --> 01:47:07,099
Come back victorious.

1462
01:47:07,362 --> 01:47:08,714
King, you...

1463
01:47:10,204 --> 01:47:12,638
There is no one for me.
I'll make my way.

1464
01:47:13,364 --> 01:47:16,259
King, don't worry about the past.

1465
01:47:17,635 --> 01:47:19,346
It's not safe for you to
stay alone in this desert.

1466
01:47:19,842 --> 01:47:20,785
I live at Kotala Kona.

1467
01:47:21,233 --> 01:47:22,355
You please go there.

1468
01:47:22,835 --> 01:47:24,747
My parents will welcome you.

1469
01:47:25,636 --> 01:47:29,005
Son, your parents are very honourable.

1470
01:47:32,499 --> 01:47:37,965
My mental stress is increasing every other
day by witnessing the moon in the sky.

1471
01:47:39,153 --> 01:47:42,137
Thyajulu,
how many more days left for the full moon?

1472
01:47:42,512 --> 01:47:43,977
King, today is ekadashi.

1473
01:47:44,703 --> 01:47:46,971
There are three more days
left for the full moon.

1474
01:47:47,748 --> 01:47:48,498
Three days?

1475
01:47:48,698 --> 01:47:52,857
What should we do if that Vijay
doesn't come to protect my daughter?

1476
01:47:54,486 --> 01:47:55,816
What should we do now?

1477
01:47:56,727 --> 01:47:59,102
How should I protect my
daughter in three days?

1478
01:48:00,502 --> 01:48:01,482
Who will protect her?

1479
01:48:03,857 --> 01:48:05,921
Minister, make the announcement.

1480
01:48:06,387 --> 01:48:08,243
Make the announcement
in all the countries.

1481
01:48:08,927 --> 01:48:13,317
Announce that I'll give away my
half of my kingdom to the one,

1482
01:48:13,702 --> 01:48:16,007
who can protect the princess from
the occult on the full moon day.

1483
01:48:16,441 --> 01:48:17,117
Not only that.

1484
01:48:17,529 --> 01:48:21,674
Also, announce that I'll get my daughter
married to the one who protects her.

1485

-King...
-What I say is final.

1486
01:48:24,021 --> 01:48:26,642
I don't scare even if I
lose the entire kingdom.

1487
01:48:27,699 --> 01:48:30,673
I just want my daughter's life.

1488
01:48:31,248 --> 01:48:34,508
Minister, we don't have much
time. Send the men promptly

1489
01:48:35,013 --> 01:48:39,724
and announce immediately...
Announce immediately...

1509
01:51:08,936 --> 01:51:10,462
Oh!
Do you speak Telugu?

1510
01:51:11,097 --> 01:51:13,879
-We speak Gulute.
-Gulute... Gulute...

1511
01:51:14,082 --> 01:51:18,746
Which means, you speak our language only
but you reversed and named it as Telugu.

1512
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:20,471
We thank you.

1513
01:51:20,642 --> 01:51:24,869
Oh no! Reverse it and say the same thing.
It will become his language.

1514
01:51:24,937 --> 01:51:25,930
I understood.

1515
01:51:26,203 --> 01:51:27,955
It means, you saved me,
I'm grateful to you.

1516
01:51:28,913 --> 01:51:29,921
By the way, who are you?

1517

By the way, why did you come here?

Huge human!
Tell us about your problem.

1526
01:51:48,098 --> 01:51:50,593
We will help you as much as
we can since you saved us.

1527
01:51:50,693 --> 01:51:51,727
-We will help you...

1528
01:51:52,221 --> 01:51:53,444
Oh! Is it so?

1529
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:56,601
So,
there is a world called Yakshini it seems.

1530
01:51:57,082 --> 01:51:59,084
There is a necklace called
Shata-Ratna necklace it seems.

1531
01:51:59,636 --> 01:52:01,849
Suggest me the way to that
world if you are aware of it.

-We know... We know...
-We know... We know...

Huge human!

1536

We know where the Yakshini world
is. We will take you there.

1537
01:52:10,745 --> 01:52:13,010
We will show you where that necklace is.

1538
01:52:13,231 --> 01:52:15,811
But it is your
responsibility to possess it.

1539
01:52:17,241 --> 01:52:19,574
I'll take care it.
Let's go.

1540
01:52:40,883 --> 01:52:42,000
This is Yakshini world.

1541
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,314
Did you see that, huge human?

1542
01:52:44,075 --> 01:52:46,346
Look at there.
Can you see the door there?

1543
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:47,902
That necklace is right there.

1544
01:52:52,684 --> 01:52:54,021
It seems like the door is locked.

1545
01:52:54,635 --> 01:52:59,510
We will search for the key but you
make sure that Fairy doesn't notice us.

1546
01:53:00,098 --> 01:53:00,675
Yeah.

is like the moonlight"

01:58:54,088 --> 01:58:55,159
You shouldn't enter into that zone.

1582
01:58:55,432 --> 01:58:57,857
Hold on, man...

1583
01:58:58,724 --> 01:58:59,350
Hold on...

Wait, you wreched human!

1606
02:04:43,334 --> 02:04:44,579
How dare you sought Shata Ratna necklace,

1607
02:04:44,971 --> 02:04:47,722
by rejecting me while I came for you?

1608
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,459
This is my curse for cheating me!

1609
02:04:50,754 --> 02:04:54,223
Let you lose the handsomeness
with which you attracted me

1610
02:04:54,535 --> 02:04:55,986
and may you turn into a hideous handicap!

1611
02:05:16,133 --> 02:05:20,792
If you reveal your identity,
or if the necklace falls on the ground,

1612
02:05:21,257 --> 02:05:25,656
the necklace shall lose its
power and becomes useless.

[water burbling] [sobbing]
Son... Son...

1614
02:05:34,916 --> 02:05:37,388
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

1615
02:05:42,742 --> 02:05:48,643
Mother... I'm praying you happily by
considering that flower as my son.

1616
02:05:49,259 --> 02:05:53,534
Tell me what happened to my
child who is in your purview.

1617
02:05:53,996 --> 02:05:57,781
Tell me... Tell me...
[sobbing]

1618
02:05:57,981 --> 02:05:58,890
Vasundara.

1619
02:06:00,052 --> 02:06:01,780
Swami, what is this tragedy?

1620
02:06:02,265 --> 02:06:06,504
You gave me a boon saying that my son
will be safe still the flower blossoms.

1621
02:06:07,336 --> 02:06:09,940
Now, what happened to him?

1622
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:12,126
Swami, tell me...
Swami, tell me...

1623
02:06:12,330 --> 02:06:13,618
Vasundara, don't worry.

1624
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:18,389
The flower has lost its colour
but didn't lose its bloom and dry.

1625
02:06:19,369 --> 02:06:22,509
Your son has just faced a danger,
that's all.

1626
02:06:23,258 --> 02:06:24,942
But he is not in a fatal situation.

1627
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,359
Stay brave, child!

1628
02:06:26,926 --> 02:06:28,594
The midnight hours are approaching.

1629
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:34,029
None of them has come to protect my
daughter despite numerous announcements.

1630
02:06:35,063 --> 02:06:39,281
Isn't it anyone in this country
who can protect from the occults?

1631
02:06:46,845 --> 02:06:49,739
Look at there...
The deadly cloud is arriving.

1632
02:06:50,951 --> 02:06:52,200
The deadly cloud is arriving.

1633
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:55,220
-Hey, wait!
-Who are you? Where are you going?

1634
02:06:56,162 --> 02:06:56,778
Who are you?

1635
02:06:58,426 --> 02:07:03,363
Princess, wear this necklace and
protect yourself from the danger.

1636
02:07:03,743 --> 02:07:06,230
Hey! Who are you?
Look at your attire!

1637
02:07:06,596 --> 02:07:07,227
Drag him out.

1638
02:07:07,783 --> 02:07:09,951
King, trust me.

1639
02:07:10,528 --> 02:07:12,945
She will be saved from the risk
if she wears this necklace.

1640
02:07:13,246 --> 02:07:14,625
She will be fine.

1641
02:07:15,164 --> 02:07:17,606
King, he is very awful.

1642
02:07:18,055 --> 02:07:20,017
What if he is hoodwinking us?
Reject it.

1643
02:07:20,380 --> 02:07:23,043
King,
this is not the right time to discuss.

1644
02:07:25,912 --> 02:07:28,442
[gasps] Everyone will be
upset if it is delayed.

1645
02:07:28,973 --> 02:07:31,363
Let me save the princess
from being taken away by the wizard.

1646
02:07:32,895 --> 02:07:36,675
King, I'll plead you.
Please, understand me.

1647
02:07:36,875 --> 02:07:39,373
King, it is nearing...

1648
02:07:40,835 --> 02:07:43,918
King... King...

1649
02:07:44,627 --> 02:07:46,601
Alright,
what's going to happen will happen.

1650
02:07:46,952 --> 02:07:49,188
Padma, wear that necklace.

1651
02:07:49,298 --> 02:07:50,071
Princess.

1652
02:08:06,671 --> 02:08:09,027
Gone...
That deadly cloud has gone...

1653
02:08:09,567 --> 02:08:13,132
-Padma, we got you.
-Father...

1654
02:08:13,497 --> 02:08:16,030
-Padma,
-Mother...

1655
02:08:16,630 --> 02:08:18,060
It is God's grace.

1656
02:08:18,539 --> 02:08:20,608
God has come in time and saved us.

1657
02:08:27,442 --> 02:08:28,134
Sir

1658
02:08:30,498 --> 02:08:34,073
You have rescued us from trouble.
You are God to us.

1659
02:08:34,729 --> 02:08:37,023
Who are you and from where did you come?

1660
02:08:37,846 --> 02:08:41,190
How does it matter?
I was able to fulfil my task.

1661
02:08:41,896 --> 02:08:44,137
You achieved the work which wasn't
achieved by our relatives or any warriors

1662
02:08:44,511 --> 02:08:49,085
and proved that you are a great warrior.

1663
02:08:50,027 --> 02:08:53,237
No matter how many services I do for
you, we cannot return your favour.

1664
02:08:54,332 --> 02:08:56,656
King,
duty doesn't expect gratitude.

1665
02:09:00,331 --> 02:09:03,239
Princess,
at all times and under all conditions

1666
02:09:04,272 --> 02:09:05,758
that necklace should be around your neck.

1667
02:09:06,689 --> 02:09:08,812
Kindly, don't remove this
necklace under any circumstances.

1668
02:09:10,074 --> 02:09:12,508
King, goodbye.

1669
02:09:16,184 --> 02:09:20,163
Announce that I'll get my daughter
married to the one who protects her.

1670
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:22,265
Sir...

1671
02:09:26,283 --> 02:09:28,927
I made a hasty announcement,

1672
02:09:29,791 --> 02:09:33,426
that I'll get my daughter married
with the hope of saving her.

1673
02:09:35,181 --> 02:09:35,870
Now...

1674
02:09:36,137 --> 02:09:38,098
King, what do you mean?

1675
02:09:38,646 --> 02:09:41,814
Are you planning to get our daughter
married to this handicapped beggar?

1676
02:09:42,495 --> 02:09:45,447
Would you ruin her life
by pairing her with him?

1677
02:09:45,865 --> 02:09:47,693
He helped as he got the opportunity.

1678
02:09:48,318 --> 02:09:51,777
Present him jewels if
you want to gift him.

1679
02:09:52,257 --> 02:09:54,597
But don't agree to get
him married to Padma.

1680
02:09:54,986 --> 02:10:00,327
Today we encountered a problem which was
never faced by this Karthikeya dynasty.

1681
02:10:01,727 --> 02:10:04,924
Would I become a wretched father
by agreeing to this wedding,

1682
02:10:06,215 --> 02:10:11,784
or would I become a black spot of
this clan by not keeping my word?

1683
02:10:13,035 --> 02:10:14,076
What should I do?

1684
02:10:15,404 --> 02:10:17,039
What is this deadly situation?

1685
02:10:20,029 --> 02:10:20,894
Father...

1686
02:10:21,967 --> 02:10:26,054
Dear... Dear...

1687
02:10:27,366 --> 02:10:30,875
Father, you don't worry.

1688
02:10:40,478 --> 02:10:42,396
My thanks to you for saving my life.

1689
02:10:43,548 --> 02:10:45,245
It's my responsibility
to tell you a truth.

1690
02:10:46,393 --> 02:10:48,706
I loved a person named, Vijay.

1691
02:10:50,386 --> 02:10:52,621
I've long back dedicated
my heart to him.

1692
02:10:53,528 --> 02:10:58,168
Anyhow, my father gave his word who
hails from the great clan of honesty,

1693
02:10:59,154 --> 02:11:00,268
gave his word.

1694
02:11:00,827 --> 02:11:01,834
According to his word...

1695
02:11:02,724 --> 02:11:06,989
I'm showing my integral
consent to marry you

1696
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:17,543
[wedding percussions]
[auspicious chantings continue]

1697
02:11:39,236 --> 02:11:40,049
Stop!

1698
02:11:40,569 --> 02:11:41,549
Haste makes waste!

1699
02:11:42,202 --> 02:11:44,026
Who decided it to be an auspicious day?

1700
02:11:44,725 --> 02:11:45,747
This is inauspicious time.

1701
02:11:46,102 --> 02:11:48,744
Wait for some time, there will
be an auspicious time.

1702
02:11:49,552 --> 02:11:51,106
Sir, who are you?

1703
02:11:52,430 --> 02:11:54,907
Didn't you hear the name of Mattebha
Shastri who is known as future teller,

1704
02:11:55,312 --> 02:11:59,927
godly,
timeless and the greatest teacher?

1705
02:12:00,127 --> 02:12:02,381
-Ah...
-[laughs]That's me.

1706
02:12:02,766 --> 02:12:03,290
Oh!

1707
02:12:03,315 --> 02:12:07,735
As I heard the news of the royal wedding
happening at an inauspicious time,

1708
02:12:08,032 --> 02:12:09,648
I came rushing.

1709
02:12:10,017 --> 02:12:13,133
I'm happy that they aren't
married yet by God's grace.

1710
02:12:13,261 --> 02:12:16,362
What? Do you doubt the
auspicious time that I've fixed?

1711
02:12:16,577 --> 02:12:18,321
[sniggering]
Calm down.

1712
02:12:19,007 --> 02:12:20,479
You will get to know in time.

1713
02:12:22,625 --> 02:12:23,460
Ah!

1714
02:12:24,165 --> 02:12:28,187
The glittering necklace around the bride's
neck was brought by the groom, isn't it?

1715
02:12:28,334 --> 02:12:30,340
Yes, sir.
That is a powerful necklace.

1716
02:12:30,563 --> 02:12:31,940
That necklace has
saved our daughter.

1717
02:12:32,278 --> 02:12:36,104
Oh! You are getting your daughter
married to him as he brought it, right?

1718
02:12:36,784 --> 02:12:40,696
Groom! The one who brings the
necklace should be a great warrior,

1719
02:12:41,082 --> 02:12:43,240
but you are handicapped.

1720
02:12:43,589 --> 02:12:45,799
My suspicion is how it
was possible for you.

1721
02:12:47,271 --> 02:12:50,766
What is it, King? There is
nothing wrong in what I said, right?

1722
02:12:51,259 --> 02:12:55,681
You are right. He should be a great
warrior to bring this powerful necklace.

1723
02:12:56,426 --> 02:12:57,406
How could you bring that?

1724
02:12:57,746 --> 02:12:58,545
That is...

1725
02:12:59,133 --> 02:13:03,755
If you reveal your identity,
or if the necklace falls on the ground,

1726
02:13:04,235 --> 02:13:08,535
the necklace shall lose its
power and becomes useless.

1727
02:13:11,925 --> 02:13:13,865
Look King, he is fumbling.

1728
02:13:14,585 --> 02:13:17,006
According to him, it's not him
who attained this necklace.

1729
02:13:17,425 --> 02:13:21,486
Someone should have given to him
or he might've stolen from someone.

1730
02:13:23,395 --> 02:13:24,765
I don't have any need to steal it.

1731
02:13:25,239 --> 02:13:26,548
I attained this necklace.

1732
02:13:26,946 --> 02:13:30,587
No, you conspired to marry the princess.

1733
02:13:30,939 --> 02:13:32,892
King, mind my words.

1734
02:13:33,147 --> 02:13:36,192
A great warrior called Vijay
has attained this necklace.

1735
02:13:36,695 --> 02:13:37,301
Vijay.

1736
02:13:39,861 --> 02:13:42,725
I say that you have
committed an atrocity and

1737
02:13:42,819 --> 02:13:44,317
stole the necklace from the
warrior by betraying him.

1738
02:13:44,517 --> 02:13:45,606
What is your stand for this?

1739
02:13:47,147 --> 02:13:48,952
You are on an auspicious wedding seats.

1740
02:13:49,615 --> 02:13:52,432
Swear on the mangalsutra
in your hand and say.

1741
02:13:52,854 --> 02:13:55,363
Is it Vijay or not who
attained this necklace?

1742
02:13:56,585 --> 02:13:58,249
Yes, it's Vijay.

1743
02:13:58,851 --> 02:14:00,721
Vijay... My Vijay...

1744
02:14:01,557 --> 02:14:03,121
Is it my Vijay who attained this necklace?

1745
02:14:03,327 --> 02:14:05,374
Then where is my Vijay?

1746
02:14:05,837 --> 02:14:07,955
Yes bride, shoot him with
straight forward questions.

1747
02:14:08,199 --> 02:14:09,484
Tell me, what did you do to him?

1748
02:14:10,697 --> 02:14:12,617
Where is my Vijay?
What did you do to him?

1749
02:14:14,359 --> 02:14:17,675
Father, he is a wicked one!

1750
02:14:17,961 --> 02:14:20,496
He has stolen this necklace
by killing my Vijay.

1751
02:14:20,721 --> 02:14:23,757
He planned to enjoy by marrying me.

1752
02:14:24,218 --> 02:14:26,511
Princess, I'm not a cheater.
Trust me.

1753
02:14:26,735 --> 02:14:30,236
What is the use of this necklace and being
alive without my Vijay?

1754
02:14:30,312 --> 02:14:32,500
Princess, don't remove that necklace.

1755
02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:34,426
-Leave me.
-Listen to me, Princess.

1756
02:14:34,731 --> 02:14:35,810
Don't remove that necklace.

1757
02:14:36,002 --> 02:14:37,538
-Princess.
-Leave me.

1758
02:14:37,738 --> 02:14:39,650
Listen to me.
Don't remove that necklace.

1759
02:14:41,154 --> 02:14:41,881
Princess...

1760
02:14:42,983 --> 02:14:47,685
[sniggering]

1761
02:14:48,027 --> 02:14:48,965
Goddess!

1762
02:14:50,096 --> 02:14:51,244
Dear Padma...

1763
02:14:52,554 --> 02:14:53,830
Goddess!

1764
02:14:54,309 --> 02:14:58,493
I brought the bride to
offer as per your order.

1765
02:15:00,896 --> 02:15:02,096
[shouts]

1766
02:15:04,493 --> 02:15:06,860
[sniggering]

1767
02:15:07,088 --> 02:15:09,770
Jittu, you are smart.

1768
02:15:09,940 --> 02:15:12,295
Thank you!

1769
02:15:13,132 --> 02:15:16,249
How dare you to escape the offering
by getting ready for the wedding?

1770
02:15:17,752 --> 02:15:20,589
Keep this girl here until
the full moon day.

1771
02:15:20,954 --> 02:15:22,706
Imprison her.

1772
02:15:22,884 --> 02:15:24,489
And espy her.

1773
02:15:24,887 --> 02:15:27,310
Dear Vijay, forgive me.

1774
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,660
We harassed and punished
you by misunderstanding.

1775
02:15:31,670 --> 02:15:36,828
You sacrificed a lot for my
daughter and took a lot of toils.

1776
02:15:37,437 --> 02:15:39,106
How do I appreciate you?

1777
02:15:40,525 --> 02:15:45,055
Dear,
this tragedy wouldn't have happened,

1778
02:15:45,694 --> 02:15:47,134
if we had recognised
you in this appearance.

1779
02:15:48,088 --> 02:15:50,593
What can we do?
It's just our fate!

1780
02:15:50,917 --> 02:15:53,127
King!
Don't worry.

1781
02:15:54,274 --> 02:15:56,391
I'll start immediately
to Bhairava Dweepam.

1782
02:15:56,771 --> 02:15:59,394
I'll somehow save my Padma
before the full moon day.

1783
02:16:00,460 --> 02:16:01,397
I'll leave now.

1784
02:16:02,477 --> 02:16:05,754
Mother! I've been trusting and praying
you for these many years.

1785
02:16:06,488 --> 02:16:09,451
What is the danger faced by my son?
How is he?

1786
02:16:09,879 --> 02:16:11,676
Tell me... Tell me...

1787
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:15,752
What happened to him?
Tell me...

1788
02:16:17,374 --> 02:16:19,509
[sobbing]
Mother.

1789
02:16:23,187 --> 02:16:23,869
Who are you, dear?

1790
02:16:24,511 --> 02:16:26,074
Mother, it's me Vijay.

1791
02:16:27,564 --> 02:16:31,261
You allayed me when I
came to you with scars.

1792
02:16:31,888 --> 02:16:35,402
You tied talisman to
safeguard me from the bad omen.

1793
02:16:38,193 --> 02:16:41,335
Everything went well
until I had the talisman.

1794
02:16:42,095 --> 02:16:44,335
Mother,
I'm starting to Bhairava Dweepam now.

1795
02:16:46,612 --> 02:16:48,942
I came to take your blessings.

1796
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:55,707
Dear, what is this appearance?

1797
02:16:58,145 --> 02:17:01,163
-A Fairy's curse.
-Curse? When did it happen?

1798
02:17:02,763 --> 02:17:03,822
before the last full moon day.

1799
02:17:04,887 --> 02:17:06,192
It was on dwadashi.

1800
02:17:08,847 --> 02:17:09,403
Dwadashi?

1801
02:17:09,818 --> 02:17:10,409
Yes, mother.

1802
02:17:21,307 --> 02:17:25,974
Dear, whose child are you?
Who are your parents?

1803
02:17:26,625 --> 02:17:27,964
I don't know whose child I am but,

1804
02:17:29,233 --> 02:17:32,485
I grew up at Kotala Kona, on
the bank of the river Gomathi.

1805
02:17:33,787 --> 02:17:35,988
I was found to the
tribals in my childhood,

1806
02:17:36,707 --> 02:17:39,815
while I was washed away
by the river on a Ugadi.

1807
02:17:42,755 --> 02:17:46,458
Ugadi...
In the river of Gomathi...

1808
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:57,288
Son, you are none other than my son.
[gasps]

1809
02:17:57,733 --> 02:18:00,060
I am the unlucky one who lost you.

1810
02:18:00,418 --> 02:18:03,881
-Mother.
-Yes, son. I am your mother.

1811
02:18:04,138 --> 02:18:05,257
-Mother...
-Son...

1812
02:18:06,222 --> 02:18:08,463
Mother... Mother...

1813
02:18:12,112 --> 02:18:13,799
Mother...
Mother of the world...

1814
02:18:14,361 --> 02:18:19,584
you gave my son back through my
husband didn't accept me on that day.

1815
02:18:20,531 --> 02:18:22,430
Mother, who is my father?

1816
02:18:24,186 --> 02:18:25,798
The King Chandra Prabhu.
[gasps]

1817
02:18:26,771 --> 02:18:27,814
The King Chandra Prabhu?

1818
02:18:28,824 --> 02:18:31,703
Then, I met him.

1819
02:18:32,308 --> 02:18:34,193
-You?
-Yes, mother.

1820
02:18:35,559 --> 02:18:38,104
He was depressed because he is facing the
wrath of the sin of refusing his wife,

1821
02:18:38,671 --> 02:18:42,609
whom he married in a celestial wedding.

1822
02:18:44,610 --> 02:18:45,728
Mother, everything went well.

1823
02:18:46,082 --> 02:18:47,355
Though we both aren't aware of each other,

1824
02:18:47,785 --> 02:18:51,376
I felt pity for him and
sent him to my hamlet.

1825
02:18:56,486 --> 02:18:57,614
Well done, Vijay!

1826
02:18:58,400 --> 02:19:01,559
You are not a normal man
but a man with a mission.

1827
02:19:01,992 --> 02:19:04,041
Which is why a Fairy gave you a boon.

1828
02:19:04,714 --> 02:19:08,816
Achieve your goal and become
victorious with its help.

1829
02:19:16,853 --> 02:19:19,142
Greetings to you, Pegasus.

1830
02:19:20,542 --> 02:19:23,651
I should reach Bhairava Dweepam
before today's midnight.

1831
02:19:24,730 --> 02:19:28,713
I'm pleading to you to take me
there according to your word.

1832
02:19:28,943 --> 02:19:31,105
Master singer, forgive me!

1833
02:19:31,409 --> 02:19:32,858
Now, you are the victim of curse.

1834
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:35,306
It is forbidden for a cursed person
to ascend the Pegasus.

1835
02:19:35,577 --> 02:19:36,133
It is forbidden.

1836
02:19:38,803 --> 02:19:39,985
But there is an option.

1837
02:19:40,441 --> 02:19:45,528
You'll get back your appearance if any
altruism perceives your appearance.

1838
02:19:46,554 --> 02:19:47,376
Forgive me, Pegasus.

1839
02:19:47,952 --> 02:19:51,426
I cannot make others suffer by
transferring my handicapped form to them.

1840
02:19:53,708 --> 02:19:55,199
I'll start with my perseverance.

can't you understand this mother's heart?"

can't you understand this mother's heart?"

1847
02:20:48,508 --> 02:20:53,010
"Won't you melt being a mother?"

1848
02:20:53,073 --> 02:20:57,211
"Won't you lift the curse?"

1851
02:21:07,036 --> 02:21:07,791

02:21:35,255 --> 02:21:39,430

"Please put an end to my tears"

1858
02:21:53,419 --> 02:21:55,459

put it on my form"

This is Goddess's determination.

This is the appearance gave by the
Goddess so that you can achieve victory.

Don't get upset.

Mother, I came here for
your precious blessings but,

1891
02:24:46,802 --> 02:24:49,627
I didn't expect that it
would become so worse.

1892
02:24:51,417 --> 02:24:55,086
Look Vijay!
This is not the right time to feel sad.

1893

Ascend the Pegasus before the full moon.

Stick to your duty and start your
journey towards victory.

[fire flaring]

1917
02:30:31,810 --> 02:30:33,914
[laughing]

1918
02:30:40,572 --> 02:30:44,571
[laughing]

1919
02:31:04,763 --> 02:31:07,655
[groans]

1920
02:31:10,029 --> 02:31:13,422
All his magical powers lie in that sword.

1921
02:31:15,634 --> 02:31:18,135
Finish him with its help.

1922
02:31:33,825 --> 02:31:36,427
[shouts]

1923
02:31:36,729 --> 02:31:41,368

1924
02:31:44,703 --> 02:31:48,974

[thud]

1927
02:32:05,702 --> 02:32:09,318
Padma... Padma... Padma...

1928
02:32:10,566 --> 02:32:11,047
Let's go.

1929
02:32:12,488 --> 02:32:17,769
[squealing]

1930
02:32:34,729 --> 02:32:38,240
[thud]

1931
02:32:44,165 --> 02:32:46,933
[thud]

1932
02:32:52,778 --> 02:32:54,731
Congratulations, great warrior!

1933
02:32:55,425 --> 02:32:59,713
You've achieved world order by killing a
demon which wasn't possible by anyone.

1934
02:32:59,976 --> 02:33:02,569
Make a wish, I'll fulfil.

1935
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:03,502
Oh Goddess!

1936
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:06,525
I'm requesting you to restore
my mother's previous form,

1937
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:09,130
who sacrificed for me.

1938
02:33:09,371 --> 02:33:10,047
So be it.

1939
02:33:21,010 --> 02:33:21,642
Mother...

1940
02:33:22,641 --> 02:33:24,129
Well done, Vijay...

1941
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:27,027
Your life became a part of history.

1942
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:29,175
Dear Vijay...

1943
02:33:29,713 --> 02:33:32,019
I betrayed this righteous woman
who has given birth to you.

1944
02:33:33,188 --> 02:33:37,672
As a result, both of my sons banished
me instead of taking care.

1945
02:33:38,656 --> 02:33:41,714
You saved me though I rejected you.

1946
02:33:42,554 --> 02:33:43,589
You made me realise.

1947
02:33:44,539 --> 02:33:45,620
And united everyone.

1948
02:33:46,019 --> 02:33:46,966
Not only that,

1949
02:33:47,636 --> 02:33:52,454
you saved my daughter's life by
destroying the evil powers.

1950
02:33:52,650 --> 02:33:55,226
King, this is not my credit.

1951
02:33:55,735 --> 02:33:57,512
[sighs] I'm just
a spectator.

1952
02:33:58,420 --> 02:33:59,685
Nothing would'be been possible if
I wouldn't have the blessings of,

1953
02:34:01,465 --> 02:34:02,419
all the Gods, my mother,

1954
02:34:05,314 --> 02:34:07,626
the love and affection of
the parents who raised me

1955
02:34:09,669 --> 02:34:14,335
and the support of the
people in my hamlet.

1956
02:34:14,808 --> 02:34:18,455
Wow!
Your humble obedience is appreciable.

1957
02:34:18,924 --> 02:34:22,113
The country will be happy if the one like
you rules with the ideal salvation,

1958
02:34:22,486 --> 02:34:27,629
thinking about the problems
of the common people.

1959
02:34:28,281 --> 02:34:30,988
Vijay... Vijay...

1960
02:34:31,007 --> 02:34:32,486
Why did you leave me and come here?

1961
02:34:33,281 --> 02:34:35,294
Father, everyone is here.

1962
02:34:35,322 --> 02:34:36,794
Mother,
I came here by jumping off the wall.

1963
02:34:39,276 --> 02:34:43,081
Chandra Prabha King, I request you
to get your son, Vijay Chandra Prathap,

1964
02:34:43,436 --> 02:34:47,955
marry my daughter Padmavathi
Devi at the earliest.

1965
02:34:48,183 --> 02:34:50,501
Thank God!
I am out of a big trouble.

1966
02:34:51,209 --> 02:34:53,467
-What is it?
-We need not jump the castle wall from now

1967
02:34:53,877 --> 02:34:55,065
we can come royally.

1968
02:34:55,183 --> 02:34:57,240
How is it?
[laughs]
