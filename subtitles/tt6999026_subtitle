1
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:13,720
I did not take a plunge in the river of love, dear friend.

2
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,360
I thought I would drown, dear friend

3
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,760
I was so afraid of death,
That I did not take a plunge;

4
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:24,400
I bathe in the Ganga every day,
And see that face reflected in the water,

5
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,480
I will get down, get the fish and be back in a flash.
You keep an eye out.

6
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,960
I’m scared.

7
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,480
Hey, why are you scared! Let’s go!

8
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,360
Quickly, get off!
I am there, get off!

9
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,680
Here, give it to me!

10
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:54,080
I wander from coast to coast, dear friend

11
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,800
I wander from coast to coast, dear friend
But I still do not find any sign of land.

12
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,760
I do not find land, dear friend,

13
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,840
I did not take a plunge

14
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,480
Get up! Get on the boat fast!

15
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,080
A land lotus blooming in the water,
What sweetness it contains within

16
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,240
- Which ghat, Indrada?

17
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,000
- The one by the mosque.

18
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,000
I don’t think they saw us!

19
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,400
Don’t be scared, Srikanta.
There’s no one in Nischindipur who can catch Indranath.

20
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,280
The black bee knows its value, dear friend
While the dung beetle does not.

21
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,760
The black bee knows its value, dear friend
While the dung beetle does not.

22
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,280
I did not take a plunge in the river of love, dear friend.

23
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
Uncle!

24
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,760
Keep that there.

25
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,840
Uncle! We have fish.

26
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,240
Yes, coming!

27
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,960
Indrada, what about these?

28
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,400
Those are for later.
We should get a good sum for these.

29
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,720
The fishermen would have finished us off
if they had caught us.

30
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,760
Don’t be afraid of anything Srikanta.

31
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,000
You are my disciple.
You cannot be afraid!

32
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,240
Why are you never afraid Indrada?

33
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,480
Who knows why!

34
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,280
Uncle!

35
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,200
- What fish did you get?
- There you are. Here, take a look.

36
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,480
Where’s your bag?

37
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,280
- What…what is this?
- Have you seen the size!

38
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,520
These will not be good.

39
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,160
Here, take this too.

40
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,480
What is this Uncle!
Give ten more at least!

41
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,040
- No, I can’t give anymore.
- You had promised the last time! A little more.

42
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,840
- Nothing more?
- This fish won’t be good.

43
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,440
Indrada, let’s go.

44
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,520
Yes, let’s go. Pick that up.

45
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,200
It’s fresh fish and he says it won’t be good!

46
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
Hey! Hi!

47
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,160
Hello!

48
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,120
Everything alright?

49
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,720
Yes.

50
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
- Have you seen Srikanta?
- No, not really.

51
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,040
Where on earth did he go?

52
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,680
What the hell ?

53
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,120
He is not here either.

54
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,520
Have you seen Srikanta?

55
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,640
He was right here.
Must have headed to the café.

56
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,200
This is not right Srikanta.

57
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,760
Working in corporate and confronting
the management so directly.

58
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,960
You won’t be able to last like this.

59
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,760
I don’t want last or even live like that.

60
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,920
We are conmen after all.

61
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,480
This management of yours,
I will not butter them up.

62
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,200
No, I will not! No sir, I will not!

63
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,760
You will never be serious.

64
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,800
Don’t switch off your phone so suddenly.
It becomes a problem, brother.

65
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
Why are you playing up to them?

66
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,400
One fine day you will find
your job is gone too.

67
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,960
Only unlucky things you have to say!

68
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,520
You live a drifter’s life.

69
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,560
Not married, so no wife or kids.

70
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,000
I have a family, don’t I.

71
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,120
Who asked you to get married?
Did I?

72
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,880
What?!
That’s the rule of the world!

73
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,360
That’s it! I don’t believe in such rules.
One day you will see I have quit and vanished.

74
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,240
Hey will drive me crazy!
See, they are calling again.

75
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,320
It’s them, that party from Belgachhia.

76
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,640
About that cancer concession-
The rate is still being fixed.

77
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,520
Let’s go.

78
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,440
Fine, let’s go.
Besides, cancer is quite productive.

79
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,360
Oh, wait a second.

80
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,520
What happened?

81
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,080
Yes, hold on a moment.
One minute.

82
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
What the fuck!

83
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,400
Here, take this.
What?

84
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,040
Use this as a coaster for your coffee.
Will come to use.

85
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,120
As in?

86
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,520
- Bye!
- Okay, bye!

87
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,200
Srikanta! Where are you going?

88
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,880
Where are you off to so abruptly?

89
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,160
Why are you laughing? Tell me!

90
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,280
And you have packed your bags too.
What is this?

91
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,000
- I’m off!
- Off as in?

92
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,920
Srikanta, wait up!
Where are you off to?

93
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,080
Wait a second!

94
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Here, take this home.

95
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,400
And the rest is for Annadadi.
Let’s go!

96
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,200
Tell them Srikanta’s aunt has died.

97
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,640
- What?
- Aunt.

98
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,080
Aunt’s died?
Just like that?

99
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,880
They will not believe it.

100
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,520
Let them!

101
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,800
You will lose your job Srikanta.

102
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,400
That’s fine too.

103
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Where will you go?

104
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,000
It’s a rager!

105
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,880
I’m serious.
You will lose your job.

106
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,840
Where I’m going, he can keep
five hundred
such corporate companies as pets.

107
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,880
My friend-

108
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,600
It’s not good to have such friends, Srikanta.

109
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,720
He says the fish is bad!

110
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,880
Will he get fish like
from Nishchindipur anywhere else?

111
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,040
Come!

112
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,640
It’s still fresh!

113
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,200
If the fishermen had caught us today,
They wouldn’t have missed a single punch.

114
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,360
Let’s go!

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,560
Sahuji will be happy today.

116
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,680
Hey ustad!

117
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,040
All well?
I see you are high on worship!

118
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,760
No, no!

119
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,840
No, wait! Give it to him!

120
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
- I’m keeping it here.
- Yes, go ahead.

121
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,560
Wait sir.

122
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Here, take this.

123
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,320
- Okay sir?
- Yes.

124
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,920
Here, give it to me.

125
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,920
Okay, I’ll be off!

126
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,080
Sahuji!

127
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh! Welcome!

128
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,240
- See what I have for you.
- What do you have there?

129
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,040
- Caught them early morning.
Totally fresh!

130
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,160
Put them there.

131
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,080
And Annadadi?

132
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,360
Annada! Annada!
See what he has got for you.

133
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,240
And what do you have for me?
How much is that?

134
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,080
One twenty five.

135
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,280
So less!

136
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,120
- Please take it.
- Okay fine! It will work.
Give it to me.

137
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,880
I have told you not to get these things.

138
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,600
What is your problem bitch?
He has brought it so nicely.

139
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,800
- And see the drama the bitch does!
- Please take it didi. I got it for you.

140
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,360
See? How much he loves you?

141
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,640
Excuse me brother!

142
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,120
Sahuji-

143
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,080
Yes?

144
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,400
When will you teach me the spells?

145
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Are spells that easy to learn, silly boy!
Serve well! You will learn them.

146
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,800
Serve well.

147
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,440
What is the name of this place?

148
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,960
Don’t know sir.

149
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,440
I drive Hukumji’s car.

150
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,440
But sometimes elephants stray this side.

151
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,800
Apparently there are bees here
whose sting can kill people.

152
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,720
That I don’t know sir.

153
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,840
You hardly know anything.

154
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,480
What?

155
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
What spells will he teach you Indrada?

156
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,040
If I learn them correctly I will become immortal.
No one will be able to kill me.

157
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,840
Then is Sahuji immortal too?
He won’t ever die?

158
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,720
No, he won’t.

159
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,400
We have to walk a little from here, sir.

160
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,120
- Is it a long way off?
- No sir, only a little.

161
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,560
- The car could have come this far, isn’t it?
- The car...

162
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,360
Oh yes, you don’t know anything.

163
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,640
Come by my place O dark-skinned one,

164
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,120
Wow! That’s one huge pandal.

165
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,280
My village lies along the Yamuna.

166
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,080
Sir, will won’t you freshen up a little?

167
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,440
Let me do something;
Let me go and meet Hukum once.

168
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,960
- You wait here.
- Okay sir, I will be here.

169
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,400
Come by my place O dark-skinned one,

170
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,320
Brother!

171
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,440
How are you? How have you been?

172
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,800
I’m good.
And your Bengali is quite good

173
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,800
I earn my food here.
How can I speak bad Bengali!

174
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,160
What will you drink?
Whiskey? Vodka?

175
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,200
- Whiskey, I want some whiskey.
- Whiskey.. Whiskey..

176
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,720
- Can I go freshen up a bit?
- Yes, of course! Quickly! Go.

177
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,800
Okay, go on. Off you go again.

178
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,600
Which one?

179
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,560
That one, sir.

180
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,680
- That one?
- Yes sir. This way

181
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,880
You keep my things in the tent.
I will go take a round of the place.

182
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,040
Okay, sir. Don’t go too far.

183
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,360
Okay, fine.

184
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,480
Come back, sir. It’s getting late.

185
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,200
Get the broom.

186
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,320
Om Hrim Krim Phat..

187
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,560
Sit up straight!

188
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,680
Yes, sit up, straight!

189
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,360
Don’t worry at all!

190
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,880
Om Hrim Krim Phat..

191
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,680
Be gone! Be gone! Be gone!

192
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,800
What did you say?
Prasanta’s mother?

193
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,840
Prasanta’s mother has possessed her.
Get her married to Prasanta..

194
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,440
Hey you two, come aside a bit.

195
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,000
- Do not come here anymore.
- Why not didi?

196
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,600
What do you think?
That he will teach you those tricks?

197
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,640
He is a liar. Does he know anything,
that he will teach you?

198
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,360
Be gone! Be gone!

199
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,480
Bloody scoundrel! Cheats people!

200
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,520
He will get that girl married
and then sell her off.

201
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,840
He will sell me off too.

202
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,480
I can’t stand this anymore.

203
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,720
Sometimes I want to run away,
leave everything behind.

204
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,280
If he finds out he will bury me alive.

205
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,600
Do you want some puffed rice?
I have some has sweets too.

206
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,840
The moonlight has broken ties with me,

207
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,520
It no longer visits my house,

208
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,480
The moonlight has broken ties with me,

209
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,840
It no longer visits my house,

210
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,800
Passes by the lane instead...

211
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,560
As I sit waiting in hope,

212
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,400
My heart grows heavy,

213
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,600
The sweet allure of its beauty,

214
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,720
Tell me how do I give it up!

215
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,000
Srikant, do you like the song?

216
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,920
Excellent!

217
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,400
My girlfriend.

218
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,640
Huh?

219
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,120
I have kept her.

220
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,280
High profile.

221
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,880
She is an excellent singer!

222
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,840
Very expensive!

223
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,880
Used to be an escort before this.

224
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,120
I brought her away and kept her.

225
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
It passes by the lane instead,

226
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Clad in a flowing silver saree

227
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,200
The moonlight has broken ties with me,

228
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,400
Bravo!

229
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,600
It no longer visits my house

230
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,680
Are you scared?

231
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,000
- Give that to me.
- Be careful.

232
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,400
Quickly! Look sharp!

233
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,480
Got it.

234
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,280
Here! This one too I think.

235
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,240
You dig for a bit.

236
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,760
I will take a leak and come.

237
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,120
Okay.

238
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,160
Srikanta! Hey, Srikanta!

239
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,320
Where are you going?

240
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,000
Hey! Wait! Hey!

241
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,880
Did you see anything?

242
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,120
It was nothing.

243
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,600
Fine now?

244
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,920
Nothing, it was nothing.

245
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,120
Look at me!

246
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,000
What is it?

247
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,960
Here, take this.

248
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,520
Take it!

249
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,920
Open your mouth.

250
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,240
Take a puff.

251
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,640
Smoke!

252
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,200
You will not be afraid anymore. Smoke.

253
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,560
Let’s go. Be careful.
Don’t be scared.

254
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,880
The moonlight has broken ties with me,
It no longer visits my house

255
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,720
Kya baat! Bravo!

256
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,960
Excellent!

257
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,880
Excellent! Excellent!

258
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,160
Bloody slut!

259
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,240
Namaskar, my name is Pyaari.

260
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,400
Your girl is Bengali!

261
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,400
Yes, she is!

262
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,960
Beautiful!

263
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,000
We are going hunting tomorrow.

264
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,600
How is it now? Do you still have aim?

265
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,120
I have not fired a rifle in a long time...

266
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,960
Okay, no problem.

267
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,080
There is nothing except birds there.
Have no fear!

268
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,720
Hmm, birds!

269
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,480
The moonlight has broken ties with me...

270
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,960
Sir.

271
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,560
Who is it?

272
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
May I come in?

273
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,560
Hmm..

274
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,560
Sir, I...

275
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,120
I’m Ratan, madam’s manager.

276
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,160
Which madam?

277
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,680
Pyaari madam.

278
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,760
Oh.

279
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,320
So, what is it?

280
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,600
Madam wants to see you once.

281
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,400
What?

282
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,120
She wants to see you once.

283
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,600
Why?

284
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,920
Has she taken a fancy to me?

285
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,160
Ask her not to do these things.
Hukum is a very dangerous man.

286
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,040
He will kill and get rid of the body.
No one will ever be able to trace anything.

287
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:17,040
Sir, madam was saying it’s very urgent.
She wants to talk.

288
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,280
Please, sir.

289
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,400
Oh, what a bother...

290
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,520
What is Hukum doing?

291
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,000
Everyone is asleep.

292
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,080
Sir, leave through the back on your way out.
I will be off too.

293
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,480
Okay, okay.

294
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,440
Sit.

295
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,840
Please leave this place at once.

296
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,040
You were not like this Srikantada!

297
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,480
You have come here to suck up to rich men?
To drink and whore?

298
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,360
Hey! Why are you calling me brother?

299
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,320
Do you know me?

300
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,880
How is auntie?

301
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,560
Please go away from here.
These are not good people.

302
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,120
You two-penny whore!
You will teach me good and bad?

303
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,440
If I tell Hukum he will throw you out tomorrow.
Do you know that?

304
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,080
You will not be able to recognise me.

305
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,800
Nor do I want to.

306
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,880
I suggest you don’t either.

307
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,880
I have nothing to give you.
I am not a rich man like Hukum.

308
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,000
That I know.

309
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,200
Or you wouldn’t have come here
to feed off someone else.

310
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,200
That’s better than being a whore.

311
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,320
Sahuji!

312
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,840
Sahuji..

313
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,920
Oh! Wow!

314
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Wow! What have you done!

315
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,560
- Open it.
- Excellent!

316
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,080
Excellent! Excellent!

317
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,160
What have you two done!

318
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,360
- There are two sacks.
- Good, keep it.

319
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,960
The two of you have done me a huge favour.
What can I even say!

320
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,640
Annada, give them a couple of sweets.

321
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,200
Wait! I will be right back.
Have sweets, drink water. I’ll just be back.

322
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Go away! Go away from here!
I’m telling you he’s not a good man.

323
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,320
Why? What will he do
with the skeletons, didi?

324
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,360
Enh! What will he do
with the skeletons, didi!

325
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,320
What do you think he will do?
He will sell them. They fetch a lot of money in Kolkata.

326
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,400
Hey!

327
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,880
What were you telling them?

328
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,680
Bloody bitch! I will..

329
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,400
- Come here! Come I say!
- No! No!

330
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,120
- I will kill you today.
- Let me go!

331
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,520
- Bitch, come here!
- Please let me go!

332
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,560
Bitch!

333
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,000
Sahuji!

334
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,920
Do not get into this!
Or I will bury you here too.

335
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,880
Listen Sahuji.
We know all about your tricks.

336
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,400
You know nothing. Nothing!

337
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,480
What will you teach me?

338
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,760
You have been cheating me all this while.
You’re a conman and a fraud.

339
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,080
If you don’t stop,
I will kill you myself.

340
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,320
And you’re followers?
They won’t be able to fucking touch me!

341
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,960
Take a turn over there and stop!

342
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,000
- It’s been a while.
- Let’s go Hukumji.

343
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,240
- We will be shooting birds, right?
- Yes

344
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,920
- Don’t these forests have bears?
- No, but there are beers in the car.

345
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,760
There are some birds, that’s it.
Don’t be scared.

346
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,160
- What if we start tourism here?
- It will ruin the place for sure.

347
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,120
- I think it might be good.
- Do it then.

348
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,600
We are talking about the land.
Let’s see!
Hey Chhotu..

349
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,280
This is empty.
Fill it up later.

350
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,840
From where is this?

351
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,920
Why count the barrels, as they say!

352
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,760
What happened brother?
Did you get scared?

353
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,160
No.

354
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,880
There are no tigers, bears
or things like that here.

355
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
I no longer kill animals.

356
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,240
I came because Hukum asked me.

357
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,320
Men are never afraid.

358
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,920
Fuck off!

359
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,320
What?

360
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,760
Did you swear?

361
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,960
- No it’s a mantra.
- Huh?

362
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,440
I get scared, right?
So I keep repeating it.

363
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,960
Hey, don’t

364
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,840
What are you doing?

365
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,400
Go! Run! Run away!

366
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
What will happen now?

367
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,560
Indrada! Quickly!

368
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,600
Where are my slippers?

369
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,200
Let’s go!

370
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,760
Run! Run!

371
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,840
You saved my skin back there.

372
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,400
- I’ll treat you to something special tomorrow.
- What is it?

373
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,520
I did not take a plunge in the river of love, dear friend.

374
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,040
Here, drink like this.

375
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,680
I thought I would drown, dear friend

376
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,680
One more glass.

377
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,240
Drink up! More!

378
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,520
I was so afraid of death,
That I did not take a plunge;

379
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,880
How is it?

380
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:15,160
I was so afraid of death, dear friend
That I did not take a plunge

381
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,400
I bathe in the Ganga every day,

382
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,920
And see that face reflected in the water,

383
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:14,440
I wander from coast to coast, dear friend
But I still do not find any sign of land.

384
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,760
I did not take a plunge

385
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,200
I have a request to make.

386
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,880
Please go away from this place.

387
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,320
Who are you?

388
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,200
If you were meant to,
you would have figured it out by now.

389
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,040
It would have been a relief if I had.

390
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,960
You would not have figured it out.

391
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,680
It would not have made a difference.

392
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,040
I know that.

393
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,600
There’s roast for lunch!

394
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,200
I do too.

395
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,440
I’m saying this for your own good.
Please listen to my request.

396
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,640
- Go away from here.
- Rubbish! I would not have come had I known

397
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,480
Srikant, see.
Put it down.

398
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,840
- Oh, what is this?
- See!

399
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,560
How is it?

400
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,200
- Wow!
- So, how is it?

401
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,480
You’re great!

402
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,200
Oh my God!

403
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,640
Okay, get to it!

404
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,120
- Did you get your guitar?
- Yes

405
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,680
We will make time and sit with it then?

406
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,440
Let’s go!

407
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,120
Quickly!

408
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,440
Chocolate flavoured?

409
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,120
Quiet!

410
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,000
Be quiet!

411
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,720
Here, take this.

412
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,520
Keep that in the bag.

413
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,120
Keep it there.

414
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,320
Srikanta! Take this!

415
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,920
Srikanta! Keep this.

416
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,320
I heard strange noises.

417
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,880
What happened? Let me check.
Don’t be scared.

418
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,160
Are you scared?

419
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,320
It’s nothing.

420
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,440
Let me check.

421
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,880
- There! Do you hear it?
- Wait, let me go and check.

422
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,320
Srikanta, don’t worry.
Don’t be scared.

423
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,880
- And if you see something unknown don’t answer.
- Okay.

424
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,640
You were not scared, were you?
I told you, it was nothing.

425
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,360
Give me your hand.

426
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,880
- What did you see Indrada?
- It was nothing. Let’s go!

427
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,000
Let’s go!

428
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,160
All I desire
Is to bathe in the teeming waters of the lake,

429
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,680
Beneath the shade of the banyan and the sacred fig
And the last frugal gusts of spring breeze.

430
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:54,040
I will make a choice,
Perhaps you should think of one too,

431
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:00,080
In the end it’s in the sundown grave
Where we must all lie in rest.

432
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,640
Do you want to go as well,
Adrift in this thrifty breeze?

433
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:41,800
To reach the rows and rows
Of graves of the sleeping dead?

434
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:01,360
Come, forget these things,
Call a girlfriend of yours,

435
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:07,080
Near whose heart I can sit,
And harvest autumn rice in her veins.

436
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,280
I know it is forbidden, To harvest autumn rice,
But I will keep my word to you,

437
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,480
In this charred land, amidst the rubble
I have kept with me a magpie-robin

438
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,640
All I desire in the end
Is to bathe in the teeming waters of the lake,

439
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,960
Beneath the shade of the banyan and the sacred fig
And the last frugal gusts of spring breeze,

440
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:08,800
And to lie in rest
In the sundown grave.

441
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,760
Sahuji!

442
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,920
Let me go!

443
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,600
Don’t hurt him!

444
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:57,880
Let me go!

445
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,640
Let him go.

446
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,440
Let him go. Don’t hurt him.

447
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,720
Let him go, it’s all my fault!

448
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,680
Don’t hurt him! Let him go.

449
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,440
Where is the sickle?

450
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,120
Let him go.

451
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,520
Where did that sickle go?

452
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,120
Sahuji! Sahuji!

453
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:40,720
You go from here. Go away Srikanta.

454
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,720
Don’t be afraid

455
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,680
Nothing will happen to you while I’m alive.

456
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,480
Go from here.

457
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:00,680
Go.

458
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,680
Go away!

459
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:16,640
Chandidas and his laundress,

460
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,000
They were the epitome of love.

461
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,040
He’s dead, he’s gone

462
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,880
- He’s gone
- Nothing will happen. It will be alright.

463
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:50,280
They died together, dear friend,

464
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:03,560
How many die like that, dear friend
I did not take a plunge

465
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,120
I’m checking, sir.

466
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:23,280
The left knee has a big cut,
And the lower half of the right leg too

467
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,600
The left elbow has more bruises

468
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,920
Okay, take a sample.

469
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,160
Sir, they hit him with a blunt object,
on the back of his head.

470
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,120
Get some control-earth as well.

471
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,480
It’s done, sir.

472
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,080
- Move the body now.
- Get the blanket.

473
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,320
- You! Clear the crowd!
- That side! The left side!

474
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,160
Don't create trouble all of you!
Move! Let us work.

475
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,960
Yes, tuck the blanket in.

476
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,760
Now haul him into the car.

477
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:00,240
It was fine as long as they were just in love. 
Why didn't they just elope! Why kill the man!

478
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,120
There! Indra was his friend, wasn’t he?
Hand him over to the police!

479
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,840
- He’s a kid. He could not have done it.
- A kid! As if!

480
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,760
What are you doing here? Get lost!

481
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,880
I have gone wrong beloved,
I ask for your forgiveness,

482
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:21,320
Along this coarse path of mine,
I wish you paint a shaded wood.

483
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,320
Kya baat! Bravo!

484
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,640
Bravo! Excellent!

485
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,680
- We have to talk.
- Yes, tell me.

486
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,360
Go!

487
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,200
Go away!

488
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,560
Srikant, you have hurt me today.

489
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,080
What? Why?

490
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,320
You went with all of us in the morning.

491
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,600
But you came back by yourself.
Why?

492
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:18,920
Oh!

493
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,880
I was not feeling well.

494
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,280
You were not feeling well?

495
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,440
Was not feeling well.

496
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,520
Was not feeling well.
Or were you too scared?

497
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,560
Tell us the truth, Srikantbabu.
You were scared, isn’t it?

498
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,600
Rubbish. I don’t get scared.

499
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,560
But we saw.
You got scared and ran away.

500
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:53,040
Do you see Hukumchandji,
these artist types will never work for us.

501
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,040
Let me tell you something.

502
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,280
I lost my fears when I was very young.

503
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,400
- I used to have a guru...
- You don’t get scared Srikantababu?

504
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,040
Then let me tell you a story.

505
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,800
There is a place in this village

506
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,000
Where no one wants to go at night.

507
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,880
Everyone believes it’s haunted.

508
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,600
Even during the day you must have people with you.

509
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:24,800
And the ones who have been there at night
have either gone mad

510
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,000
Or have died of a heart attack right there.

511
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,200
You did not hear me, did you?

512
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,560
I don’t get scared.

513
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,520
Where is this place?

514
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,080
There is a burning ghat nearby.

515
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,400
It’s right there.

516
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,240
And the cremation ground is a suicide zone.

517
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,720
So many people have killed themselves there.

518
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,680
I’m telling the truth, madam

519
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,200
No one wants to go there at night.

520
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,280
Even if someone dies at night

521
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,320
They wait outside the place till morning

522
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:08,040
Until it is dawn and they can enter.

523
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,160
Strange sounds are heard at night.

524
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,720
People have seen things too.

525
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,200
Many people have gone mad there.

526
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,160
Many have died.

527
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,160
So...

528
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,000
Do you want to go there tonight, Srikanta?

529
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,320
To the burning...

530
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:45,320
If you really are so daring,
spend two hours there tonight.

531
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,440
Two hours!

532
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,160
Even if he can last five minutes...

533
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,800
No, no. There’s no need. Let it be.

534
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,160
Why invite trouble for so reason.

535
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,680
I can do it.

536
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,800
I can stay the whole night too.

537
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,200
But if I have to take such a risk

538
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,480
What will I get in return?

539
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,600
You will?

540
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,000
- You will go?
- Yes , I will.

541
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,920
But depends on what you give me.

542
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,160
I bet two thousand.

543
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,080
Huh! Money! It’s not about greed.

544
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,120
No, no, no...

545
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,480
I have no greed.

546
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,320
Take this.

547
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,440
iPhone! The latest..

548
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,000
iPhone!
You’re measuring me with an iPhone, Hukum?

549
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,920
Hey! Repeat!

550
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,840
Mine too. Strong.

551
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,240
Move!

552
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,280
Okay.

553
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,160
I respect you Srikant.

554
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,200
I will get you a great job.

555
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,320
Your beggar-like, vagabond days are now over..

556
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,640
What job will you give me?

557
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,880
No one gives me a job.
I take up jobs.

558
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,160
And I kick them aside
if I don’t like them.

559
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:27,000
Do you know who you are talking to Srikantbabu?
This is very offensive.

560
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,600
Do you know Hukumchandji’s father?

561
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,120
These two move around with ministers.

562
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,040
And do you know about their
political connections?

563
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,280
They can end you with a snap of their fingers.

564
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,120
No one will ever know anything..

565
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,720
Divakar! Hush!

566
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,240
What is this!

567
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,600
This is how Srikant is.

568
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,040
And I love him for that.

569
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,280
Tell me, what do you want?

570
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,840
A 2BHK flat in Rajarhat?

571
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,360
Or a bungalow on the Bypass?

572
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,920
A four-wheeler? Or both?

573
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,480
Whatever you want, tell me.

574
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,920
You don’t know me at all, Hukum.

575
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,520
Cars, houses, bungalows, flats..
I give a damn about these things at all.

576
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,880
Why don’t we finish dinner.
It’s quite late already.

577
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,680
I have one more proposal, Srikant.

578
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:57,680
Huh?

579
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,240
Spend two hours tonight
in the burning ghat.

580
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,400
For the rest of the night

581
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,280
Pyaari is yours.

582
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,320
Are you in, Srikant?

583
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,200
So? Are you in?

584
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,440
Are you in?

585
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,040
I’m in.

586
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,920
He’s in!

587
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,160
He’s in! Bravo!

588
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,440
Is your mother going to repeat the drink?

589
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,360
Give me one too.

590
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,320
If you are so starved why haven't you gotten married?

591
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,880
Why do you need a whore?

592
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,400
Starved of what?

593
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,720
Shame on you Srikantada!

594
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,760
I did not think you
could have changed so much.

595
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,440
We meet later tonight, Rajlakshmi.

596
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,280
What? What did you say!

597
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,200
Srikantbabu, you can’t take
your phone with you.

598
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,720
Yes! Mobiles will scare away the ghosts.

599
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,320
Fine, I will leave it behind.

600
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,240
Yes, leave it behind.

601
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,080
Who do we inform if you die, Srikant?

602
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:50,480
- Just come to Pyaari’s tent tomorrow morning.
- Srikantbabu, this will have consequences.

603
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,040
Be careful!

604
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,040
Leave me!

605
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,720
Hukumchandji, carefully

606
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,080
I have to pee motherfucker!

607
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,560
It’s that way, right?

608
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,560
Are we there?

609
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,920
Yes, sir. The burning ghat is that way.

610
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,560
I will come back around  2 am.

611
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,280
- You people can leave if you wish.
- Okay, sir.

612
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,080
Hey you! Come here.

613
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,240
You have come from Bangladesh?

614
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,160
- Where in Bangladesh?
- Mymensingh.

615
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,600
From today you are my personal.
Do you understand?

616
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,680
Illiterate!

617
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,240
As in you do as I say from today.
Do you get it?

618
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,040
Hmm, now sweep..

619
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,040
You used to torture me so much, Srikantada.

620
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,520
Why are you putting them down?

621
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,160
Get going now!

622
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,160
Please take this.

623
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,240
Do you remember that day?

624
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,400
Give me some.

625
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,640
Give me..

626
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:52,680
Please give me some..

627
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,080
Give me..

628
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,800
You won’t? Okay!

629
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,080
Please give me some..

630
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,160
Wait..

631
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:49,640
- It takes an hour to cross over by boat.
- Let’s go.

632
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,680
No one will know.

633
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,880
We can’t do that!

634
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,560
Full of fancies, aren’t you?

635
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,200
No, let’s..

636
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,920
It’s nice this side as well. Isn’t it?

637
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,080
You must get me some tomorrow.

638
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,560
- I will spank you if they are sour.
- Raju!

639
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,320
Raju!

640
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,320
Raju!

641
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,400
Raju! There you are!

642
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,800
Who is that?

643
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:16,880
My father..

644
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,800
- Baba!
- Get up!

645
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:19,800
Baba, let me go.

646
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,560
- Come with me!
- Baba, you are hurting me.

647
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,720
- How dare you!
- Let me go!

648
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,760
I will chop you up and
throw you into the river.

649
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Come back home!
I will show you today!

650
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,000
I was scared that day.

651
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,880
What would you do today?

652
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,360
I’m leaving.

653
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,480
Srikantada, let’s run away from here.

654
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:57,840
Where to?

655
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:58,960
I don’t know.

656
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,920
Indrada might be in Kolkata.

657
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,240
Do you want to go?

658
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,000
Okay!

659
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,240
Tonight then?

660
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:10,920
Hmm...

661
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:14,520
No.

662
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,600
No. Tomorrow, at dawn.

663
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,800
Get your things and
come to the bus-stand. Okay?

664
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,520
- Yes, okay.
- Now go home. I’m going too.

665
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,040
I have travelled nearly the whole of India.

666
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,600
I had a master in Lucknow
to teach me to sing.

667
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:36,400
Yes, your voice is quite beautiful.
I had never heard you sing before.

668
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:42,680
After I learnt singing
my rate increased a lot.

669
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,200
A whore who can sing!

670
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:55,920
In Kolkata if you know Rabindrasangeet
your rate increases.

671
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,480
- Really?
- Yes.

672
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,680
I taught myself using music CDs.

673
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,600
If the bhadralok, before they move to the bed,
listen to Rabindrasangeet,

674
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:13,240
they can last longer.
As in, the satisfaction is a little more.

675
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,800
The way you are talking!

676
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,360
You have become used to it, haven’t you?

677
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,000
Do you feel bad?

678
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,040
Okay fine,

679
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,400
I won’t say such things again.

680
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:29,960
Come in! Come in!

681
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,600
Please come.

682
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,760
I will call the girl.

683
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,440
Do you have it with you?

684
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,080
I’m calling her.

685
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:02,320
Raju!

686
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,200
Raju!

687
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:08,840
What happened!

688
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,280
Coming Baba!

689
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:11,920
Come here.

690
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,600
Here, this is your husband.

691
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,400
Don’t worry. Everything will be alright.

692
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:03,320
He was the one who brought me to Kolkata
and sold me off in Sonagachhi.

693
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:14,080
I did not take a plunge in the river of love, dear friend.

694
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:25,840
I thought I would drown, dear friend

695
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,720
I was so afraid of death,

696
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,360
That I did not take a plunge;

697
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:58,080
I did not take a plunge in the river of love, dear friend.

698
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,320
I’m a coward.

699
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:22,120
Indrada would have never have done
something like that in my place.

700
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,920
By now we could had a beautiful family.

701
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:38,040
Surely Indrada and Annadadi
have one of their own.

702
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:41,920
Hmm..

703
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,720
They have children too probably.

704
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,360
If they are alive.

705
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,800
Why don’t you sit down.

706
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,640
Don’t you go home anymore?

707
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,000
No.

708
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,840
My brothers have taken over whatever I had.

709
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:00,440
Now there is trouble whenever I go home.

710
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,800
Will anyone recognise me there?

711
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,040
I don’t know.

712
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,560
I want to go there once.

713
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,960
Will you take me there one day?

714
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,560
Surely we can go!

715
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,600
We can’t roam around too much.

716
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,440
We have to return the same day.

717
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:41,960
Fine,

718
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,280
So be it.

719
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:11,440
I looked for you far and wide.

720
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,480
That’s a lie!

721
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:34,400
I was the one who looked for you.

722
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:46,640
All my life I have endured
everything done to my body.

723
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:55,080
Just so I can see you again someday.

724
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:08,400
Or else I would have killed myself long ago.

725
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:22,080
There is nothing left in
my body anymore, Srikantada.

726
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:29,840
Hukum will toss me aside in some time.

727
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,160
Srikantada,

728
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,560
Let’s run away from here.

729
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:50,440
I have a lot of money.
There’s nothing to worry there.

730
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:51,680
What!

731
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:54,800
We cannot do that.

732
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,240
It cannot happen.

733
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,800
I know.

734
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,160
You will not be able to.

735
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,840
I…

736
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,400
I…

737
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,200
I…

738
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:33,200
I never thought I was going to see you again.

739
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:38,440
I…

740
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:43,320
I don’t want to lose you again.

741
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,520
From today...

742
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,840
From today you are my personal.

743
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:21,680
I have got something.
Will you wear it?

744
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:23,000
Hmm.

745
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:38,200
When you love someone,
you will filnd your heart softening on its own.

746
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:50,680
I have gone wrong beloved,
I ask for your forgiveness,

747
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:58,120
Along this coarse path of mine,
I wish you paint a shaded wood.

748
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:11,000
The sunlight leaning on your shoulder,
Afternoons that graze your lips,

749
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:19,640
Amidst all this light and wonder,
I ask for your forgiveness.

750
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:12,040
Through nights of stifled tears,
Holding damp yellow flowers in hand,

751
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:25,640
Become one with the darkness,
I ask for your forgiveness.

752
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:47,440
This life in a big city,
Is a dead magpie-robin’s cage,

753
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:53,680
Look away from it lightly,
I ask for your forgiveness.

754
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:16,680
Look away from it lightly,
I ask for your forgiveness.

755
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:56,920
Sir, Hukumji wants to see the two of you.

756
01:36:59,040 --> 01:36:59,880
Let’s go.

757
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:05,720
Hey Srikantbabu!

758
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:08,960
Congratulations!

759
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:09,680
Thank you.

760
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:12,400
So?

761
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,520
You are quite a dangerous man!

762
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:19,560
So late in the burning ghat...

763
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,600
How did you do it?

764
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,120
So what did you see there?

765
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,120
Nothing much.

766
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,200
Just heard some strange noises.

767
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,920
That’s strange!

768
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:32,920
You saw nothing?

769
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:35,480
He’s lying. It can’t be.

770
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,480
From what you are saying,
If there was something would I be here?

771
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:41,920
You would be cremating me right now!

772
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,480
You won the bet Srikant.

773
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,280
Tell me what you want.

774
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,520
What do you mean?

775
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:00,840
What did we agree on?

776
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,240
What we agreed on...

777
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,120
I was so drunk,

778
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,000
I don’t remember.

779
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:28,760
Come,

780
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:30,520
sit down.

781
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:31,840
Srikant,

782
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:38,040
I seriously don’t remember
what we decided last night.

783
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:39,600
We...

784
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:42,880
Oh yes...

785
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,920
I remember now...

786
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,640
If you won the bet,

787
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:56,360
You were going to sleep with Pyaari.

788
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:58,680
Isn’t that so?

789
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,000
So, how was it?

790
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:15,240
No, no, no...

791
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,280
No, no, no Srikant.

792
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,640
This was not right.

793
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,320
Srikant, this is not just fair!

794
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:25,920
Srikant, this is not fair!

795
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:31,480
Whatever I said while I was drunk, and you

796
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:32,920
You whore!

797
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:36,480
Is this how you treat
such an old friendship?

798
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:37,400
Motherfucker!

799
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:38,560
Get up! Get up!

800
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,040
Are you hurt?

801
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:42,520
Are you hurt?

802
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,320
I should not have brought you here.

803
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:51,680
Is this how you repay such an old friendship?

804
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,080
Motherfucker!

805
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:54,920
Motherfucker!

806
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:58,280
Let me go!

807
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:01,320
Go away! Go away from here Srikant.

808
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:08,000
Or I will not be responsible for what happens.
I will chop you up and throw you into the river.

809
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,640
No one will ever know.

810
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,120
Don’t look at her!

811
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:16,200
- Let him go!
- Don’t look at her!

812
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:20,120
If you look at her you will die!

813
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:25,760
You will die,
I’m warning you!

814
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,280
Get lost! Take him away!

815
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,440
Sorry for the inconvenience, Srikant.

816
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,720
Come with me slut!

817
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:45,360
Bloody bitch wants to be a singer! Come!

818
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,240
I got you here you whore! Come!

819
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:53,160
I will fuck you and show you!
Bloody pig!

820
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:58,400
Having fun at my expense and
Bloody two-penny whore!

821
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,480
How does this burn feel?
Do you like it?

822
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,360
You are in too much heat!

823
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:11,880
Not happy with the money you are getting?
Want something bigger, is that it?

824
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:41,440
- Will you remember everything?
- Yes sir.

825
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,480
Do what I have told you.

826
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:37,800
It’s you!

827
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:39,640
Are you alright?

828
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:47,880
I won’t spare him!

829
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:29,720
Take this.

830
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:31,760
wait wait..

831
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:32,880
Take this!

832
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:33,640
No. No.

833
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,280
Take it! Shoot him!

834
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,360
Let’s leave quickly!

835
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:43,480
Quickly, let’s go!

836
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:03,760
Shoot him!

837
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,200
Shoot him!

838
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:09,600
Fire!

839
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,000
Let’s run away!

840
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:12,800
Fire!

841
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:17,840
Let’s go! Fast.

842
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:20,480
Quick.

843
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,560
Run!

844
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:32,160
Fast!

845
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:34,120
Quickly!

846
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,600
Quick madam!

847
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,520
- Do you have the keys?
- Yes I do.

848
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,360
Let's go, quickly!

849
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:16,360
Where are we going?

850
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,320
Let’s leave this area first.

851
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:21,360
They can still catch us.

852
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:24,360
Madam, should we go to Kolkata?

853
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:31,000
Should we go to Nishchindipur?

854
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,240
Hukum does not know about it.

855
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:41,640
Diamond! Kakdwip! Namkhana! Diamond!

856
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,680
I’m throwing away your phones.
Buy new ones later.

857
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:46,400
- Okay
- Get going now!

858
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:54,040
Don’t go to Kolkata right now either.
I will get in touch with you.

859
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,840
Fine. I will head towards Medinipur.

860
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:57,920
Okay, fine.

861
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,920
- Travel safe!
- Take care!

862
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,360
- Madam, everything is in the bag.
- Let’s go!

863
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,640
Diamond! Kakdwip! Namkhana! Diamond!

864
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:08,840
Empty seats! Come fast!

865
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:10,040
Thank you brother!

866
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:12,280
Be careful!

867
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:13,280
You too!

868
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:24,200
Keep to the left.
Keep to the left.

869
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:48,680
Sit up straight or you will fall.

870
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:23,960
How do you know Hukum?

871
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,600
We used to be in the same college.

872
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:29,240
He was two years junior to me.

873
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:32,320
- I have lived off of him on many occasions.
- Hmm...

874
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:42,000
- Once we reach I’m not going to anyone’s house.
- Okay, that’s fine.

875
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,520
Someone or the other will still recognise us.

876
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:54,760
The places we used to frequent, we will go there.
The sand dunes, the mosque..

877
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:57,240
And the woods of kans grass?

878
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:02,560
Are those places still there?

879
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:04,520
Who knows!

880
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:33,560
See what state the old ghat is in!

881
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,400
Oh no! What is this!

882
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:39,480
And when was this new ghat built?

883
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,440
Not too long ago I think.

884
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:51,440
- This is Nishchindipur, right?
- Yes, sir.

885
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:55,320
- Which way is Khiroda Das’s house?

886
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:58,480
They don't live here anymore.
They abandoned their land and left.

887
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,880
When Cyclone Aila struck in 2009
it swept everything away.

888
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,400
Who knows where everyone went after that.

889
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:09,440
- Where do Nanda, Ranu or Srinath Gayen live?
- I told you sir, I don't know.

890
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,320
I am new too.
I have been here only five-six years.

891
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,800
Oh, you are new to these parts too!

892
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,680
- I don’t think anyone is there anymore.
- Who knows!

893
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:26,520
- Have you visited recently?
- No, it’s been a while.

894
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,680
Things have changed so much!

895
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:43,800
Wasn’t there something else here?

896
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,840
Here Indrada and I had once...

897
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:48,200
It’s changed so much!

898
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,720
So strange! Everything is different.

899
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:00,600
Oh, it’s our school!

900
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:06,000
- The school looks great now, doesn’t it?
- Yes it does!

901
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:09,520
- It used to be mudbricks only.
- Now they have built two floors!

902
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:17,880
Watch your step!

903
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:24,520
- This used to be Iman chacha’s house.
- Hmm

904
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,760
- Can’t believe it!
- Let’s go see your old house.

905
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,080
It’s empty.

906
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,360
When was it made pucca?

907
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,480
Around eighteen-twenty years ago.

908
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,040
Right after you left.

909
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:04,320
- Everything seems so desolate.
- Sit.

910
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:38,440
So many years have passed.
So many things have happened, isn’t it?

911
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:39,120
Hmm...

912
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,440
Now where do you want to go?

913
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,880
- Kolkata.
- But what if Hukumchand...

914
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:49,360
I have a flat in Rajarhat.
No one knows about it.

915
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:51,920
I want to go stay there for a while.

916
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:58,240
Then we can sell it off and go somewhere else.
Delhi or Bombay perhaps.

917
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:01,280
I want a home with you.

918
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:03,800
We need money for that.

919
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:08,120
We can’t set up a home based on selling a flat.
I have no money, nothing.

920
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:10,040
Don’t worry about all that.

921
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:15,880
I have worked all these years, haven’t I?
We can make do with what I have for now.

922
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:19,520
Eventually we can start something together.

923
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:06,320
Come!

924
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:08,680
Come!

925
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:12,200
- That one! That’s my flat.
- That one? Top floor?

926
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,080
The elevator is that side.

927
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,160
Come!

928
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:34,280
Come in!

929
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:46,680
It’s beautiful!

930
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,600
We have to set it up well.

931
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:06,560
What do I dress you in,
How do I adorn you?

932
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:12,160
I wonder if you will take me along,
And I always end up baffled.

933
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:29,440
I will not find peace,
I will not go out to play,

934
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:35,520
I will not go and gather,
The sleep that has fallen like dew.

935
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:39,160
Time has lost it way

936
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:45,840
Time has lost its way and stopped,

937
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:52,560
And I have fallen in love
With being in love with you.

938
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:22,120
Whatever your name
Whatever your worth,

939
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:27,160
If your eyes have no love,
Neither Radha nor Shyam matter.

940
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:36,040
O flute player,

941
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:45,360
I will break off all ties with you
Beneath the kadam tree.

942
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:50,400
I will weep and make up stories,
Only to steal your flute,

943
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:54,560
Time will lose its music

944
01:55:57,680 --> 01:56:01,720
Time will lose its music and stop

945
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:07,160
I have fallen in love
With being in love with you.

946
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:20,680
Oh! It’s you!

947
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:28,600
Catch me if you can!

948
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:32,600
See! That plane!

949
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:36,520
It’s flying home! To Bangladesh! To Mymensingh!

950
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,280
Will you come with me?

951
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,160
Shepherd, you are truly cunning,
You had simply thought

952
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:54,520
Calling Radha by her name
Would be enough to entice her.

953
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:11,880
You don’t know Radha well,
You don’t know her yet,

954
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:24,040
Radha will snatch your flute
And plunge into the Yamuna,

955
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:28,320
I have fallen in love
With being in love with you.

956
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:33,960
Radha will snatch your flute
And plunge into the Yamuna,

957
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:39,680
I have fallen in love
With being in love with you.

958
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:08,280
Rajlakshmi and Srikanta

959
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:11,760
This way

960
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,160
It’s quite unique.

961
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:23,880
You don’t like it, right?

962
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,120
Hukumchand would not have liked it either.

963
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:27,520
Whatever!

964
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:30,520
No, I quite like it.

965
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:33,040
Here after a long time.

966
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:34,760
Srikanta, isn’t it?

967
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:39,640
You are Srikanta, right?

968
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:41,920
Yes, and you are?

969
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:46,280
Think about it a little bit, brother...

970
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:50,120
- Do you recognise me yet?
- Not really!

971
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:51,080
You don’t, right?

972
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:53,600
I’m your Indrada, you idiot!

973
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:54,720
Indrada!

974
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:58,320
Where have you been?
How are you?

975
01:59:58,400 --> 01:59:59,640
Tell me how you are.

976
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:01,360
I can’t believe it’s you!

977
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,200
I could never have imagined
running into you here!

978
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,680
- Do you recognise him?
- Incredible!

979
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:05,800
- Yes
- It’s Indrada!

980
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:06,960
That’s the one!

981
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:07,760
Come!

982
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,720
Wow! What is that?

983
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:13,920
Just see what he has done!

984
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,280
Oh! Who has made this?
It’s so beautiful!

985
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:18,280
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

986
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,160
- Do I take off my shoes here?
- Yes, of course!

987
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,680
- Come, let’s sit.
- Yes.

988
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:31,160
- Wow!
- What?

989
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:32,320
Very pretty!

990
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:34,760
Why don’t you show Annadadi around?

991
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:36,440
- Yes, the two of you sit.
- Yes, we will be here.

992
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:37,320
Come, let’s go.

993
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:39,800
- Indrada, go take a look around.
- Later. Let’s talk first!

994
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:40,440
Okay.

995
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:45,680
This is one room.

996
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:50,360
It usually stays empty.

997
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:53,200
It’s such a big house, Lakshmi!

998
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:06,400
Didi, be careful!

999
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,760
- Oh, it’s tipped over!
- No, that’s fine!

1000
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:14,760
Look at that side.
The airport is quite nearby.

1001
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:15,600
Really?

1002
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:19,560
Planes take off all the time.

1003
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:23,120
Our roof is very beautiful too.

1004
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:27,760
The munchies are excellent!

1005
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:30,320
It’s all Rajlakshmi.
She arranges it very well.

1006
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:31,240
Do you want some?

1007
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:34,200
- No, I told you, not drinking bad alcohol.
- Pass me the phone for a moment.

1008
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,600
- Have some! It’s Joy Bangla!
- No.

1009
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:39,640
- Here.
- Yes, show me

1010
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,920
So pretty! She’s all grown up!

1011
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:49,560
Of course! She was supposed to!
Isn’t it?

1012
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,640
And you have become a
big businessman yourself.

1013
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:57,280
Yes, as big a businessman one can become
by running a stationery shop.

1014
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:00,520
But Srikanta, you are still the same.

1015
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:02,880
Except the obvious physical changes.

1016
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:03,960
- Change?
- Hmm

1017
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:08,200
We have just returned from witnessing it.
We went to Nishchindipur, the two of us.

1018
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:09,480
Everything’s changed!

1019
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:11,160
- Our school...
- Hmm...

1020
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:13,200
It’s completely changed.
As has the market.

1021
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,800
No one lives in our house anymore.
My brother has left the village for good.

1022
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:16,800
- Really?
- Yes.

1023
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:21,680
Neither did we come across a familiar face anywhere.
All the roads have been reconstructed.

1024
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:23,320
It’s all strangers everywhere.

1025
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:25,640
Is Sahuji’s house still there?

1026
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,520
Why don’t all of us go one day?

1027
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:33,320
Yes, let’s!

1028
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:35,600
This is Pinky.

1029
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:39,120
Oh! She looks just like Indrada.

1030
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:40,400
I want to revisit too but..

1031
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:42,520
Nothing will happen.
No one will recognise us.

1032
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:44,520
- It’s all strangers.
- Yes, that’s settled then.

1033
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:47,520
Let’s make a plan.
Didi, tell me when do you want to go?

1034
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:49,160
Let all of us go together!

1035
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:52,440
- Let’s go! Bring your daughter along as well.
- Yes.

1036
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:55,640
She is from this generation.
She won’t enjoy it.

1037
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:59,920
Then Srikanta, next Sunday
let’s go visit Nishchindipur.

1038
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:03,080
Yes, let’s! I’ll book a car? Okay?

1039
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:05,720
- We will return that day itself, right?
- Yes.

1040
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:08,120
- We will return in good time.
- Great! Joy Bangla!

1041
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:46,680
Srikanta, I can’t tell you how good it was
running into you and Lakshmi.

1042
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:51,120
I’m absolutely thrilled!

1043
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:55,040
I never thought it would happen.

1044
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:58,160
Srikanta, tell me something,

1045
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:00,200
Where did you meet Lakshmi again?

1046
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:04,800
Okay, I will tell them!
But you tell us first.

1047
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:07,600
What happened after you two left the village?

1048
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:18,320
After that we!

1049
02:04:54,480 --> 02:05:00,400
Chandidas and his laundress,

1050
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:05,600
They were the epitome of love.

1051
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:31,680
They died together, dear friend,

1052
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:44,680
How many die like that?

1053
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:50,680
How many die like that, dear friend

1054
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:58,000
I did not take a plunge

1055
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:04,600
I did not take a plunge in the river of love.

1056
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:15,760
Hmm. Do one thing.

1057
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:20,480
Spend the night here
and leave for Kolkata at dawn.

1058
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:23,800
It will not be safe here.

1059
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:26,640
Sahuji’s men are everywhere.

1060
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:29,680
They will kill you if they find you.

1061
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:35,160
Also, I have a friend in Sealdah;

1062
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:38,200
Tell him about me.

1063
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:42,000
See if you can manage a job there.

1064
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:44,720
Don’t worry.

1065
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:48,760
I will get some paper.
Write down his address.

1066
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:09,200
Let me go!

1067
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:11,920
Untie my hands you bastards!

1068
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:16,320
Untie me and see, you dogs

1069
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:18,760
I will finish off all of you!

1070
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:19,880
Untie me!

1071
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:25,720
You dogs!

1072
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:28,400
Untie me!

1073
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:00,360
You bloody dog!

1074
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:03,680
Let her go you bastard!

1075
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:04,840
Let her go!

1076
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,200
I won’t go.

1077
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:09,800
- Let her go!
- I won’t!

1078
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:12,800
You bastards! Let her go!

1079
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:14,320
No, I won’t go!

1080
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:17,760
Let her go!

1081
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:22,240
Let her go!

1082
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:56,280
Hey, the two of you, come here!
Hold her down.

1083
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:55,000
Is that car following us?

1084
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:02,440
Go! Get ahead of them!

1085
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:06,880
Catch them! Quickly!

1086
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,560
Drive faster!

1087
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:15,960
Faster!

1088
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:19,320
Overtake! Fast! Fast!

1089
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:26,640
Ratan, go faster!

1090
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:31,080
Rajlakskmi, run! From the other side!

1091
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:33,520
- What do we do now?
- The other side! Run!

1092
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:35,000
Run! Run!

1093
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:38,520
No! No!

1094
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:41,200
- Let him go!
- Rajlakshmi, run!

1095
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:42,680
No! Let me go!

1096
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:46,840
Take them!

1097
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:47,880
Let us go!

1098
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:49,600
Ratan!

1099
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:50,640
Ratan!

1100
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:52,560
Rajlakshmi!

1101
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:55,720
Get them inside! Now!
Quickly! Let’s go!

1102
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:58,200
Get up, bitch!

1103
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:21,720
From that end! More...

1104
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:24,240
Clean it!

1105
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:27,320
Move the soil to the side.

1106
02:12:28,040 --> 02:12:30,320
A little more. Make it longer.

1107
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:33,760
Yes, this side.

1108
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:42,480
This side too.

1109
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,720
Do it fast!

1110
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:54,040
Make it a little deeper.

1111
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:03,000
Quick.

1112
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:25,520
Divakar

1113
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:26,480
Yes, sir.

1114
02:13:31,480 --> 02:13:32,240
Come!

1115
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:34,480
Come with me!

1116
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:09,680
Yes, you come too!

1117
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:49,400
How does it feel, Srikantbabu?

1118
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:59,480
That scar on your leg, it’s for life.

1119
02:16:06,920 --> 02:16:09,560
- Raju, hand me the shovel.
- Yes.

1120
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:27,000
Here, smoke this.

1121
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:33,240
Pass me the fire.

1122
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:41,680
Finish it fast.

1123
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:20,960
Yes, fill it up completely.

1124
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:38,320
Do it fast.

1125
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:42,400
Cover this end as well.

1126
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:47,920
All I desire
Is to bathe in the teeming waters of the lake,

1127
02:17:48,440 --> 02:17:54,440
Beneath the shade of the banyan and the sacred fig
And the last frugal gusts of spring breeze.

1128
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:17,800
I will make a choice,
Perhaps you should think of one too,

1129
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:23,840
In the end it’s in the sundown grave
Where we must all lie in rest.

1130
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:36,480
Get him a handkerchief.

1131
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:59,400
Do you want to go as well,
Adrift in this thrifty breeze?

1132
02:18:59,880 --> 02:19:09,800
To reach the rows and rows
Of graves of the sleeping dead?

1133
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:25,120
Come, forget these things,
Call a girlfriend of yours,

1134
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:30,840
Near whose heart I can sit,
And harvest autumn rice in her veins.

1135
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:54,040
I know it is forbidden, to harvest autumn rice,
But I will keep my word to you,

1136
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:59,680
In this charred land, amidst the rubble
I have kept with me a magpie-robin

1137
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:19,400
All I desire in the end
Is to bathe in the teeming waters of the lake,

1138
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:25,200
Beneath the shade of the banyan and the sacred fig
And the last frugal gusts of spring breeze,

1139
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:31,720
And to lie in rest
In the sundown grave.

1140
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:56,520
- Will you wash it?
- Yes, was going to.

1141
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:59,560
This one, I want to keep this at home.
Is that okay?

1142
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:02,440
Okay.

1143
02:21:03,160 --> 02:21:06,280
- Some more like this.
- Take this, I will get better ones.

1144
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:09,760
No! It’s a brick!

1145
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:18,920
Let’s get into the water.

1146
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:20,880
- What?
- Please! Let’s!

1147
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:23,720
- There was a pretty one there...
- It’s low-tide, where will you even go?

1148
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:26,800
- Go ahead if you want.
- Didi, you come with me.

1149
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:29,040
No, not me! You go by yourself!

1150
02:21:31,360 --> 02:21:32,520
I’m not getting in.

1151
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:45,320
Here’s another one!

1152
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:52,400
This is how we arrive
And how we are swept away.

1153
02:21:59,320 --> 02:22:10,520
Like light, like laughter,
Like the fragrance of flowers,

1154
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:30,640
Like the wind, like an addiction,
We are swept away like the waves.

1155
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:38,600
This is how we arrive
And how we are swept away.

1156
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:49,640
We arrive on the golden rays of dawn,
We depart on the muted glow of dusk,

1157
02:22:55,320 --> 02:23:03,720
Like the hues of an autumn rainbow,
Or the languid ways of the moonlight,

1158
02:23:16,760 --> 02:23:24,440
Like a sudden flash of lightning
We gaze and laugh for a while.

1159
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:32,400
This is how we arrive
And how we are swept away.

1160
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:38,560
We are fair and pure,
Full of peace and content,

1161
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:46,040
We arrive but none can tie us down;

1162
02:24:03,880 --> 02:24:09,840
We are in the green and in the dew,
We are in the blue of the sky above,

1163
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:14,680
In music and in perfumes,
In light and in the air,

1164
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:35,520
We come from the land of dreams
And that is where we return to.

1165
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:41,000
This is how we arrive
And how we are swept away.
