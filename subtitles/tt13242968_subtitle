00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,260
HOUSE NUMBER 13

2
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,470
Brother, party is still going on.

3
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,500
I got bored.
So, Ram and I have come out for a walk..

4
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,140
Yes.

5
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,180
What the hell!

6
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,670
You think you're a rowdy?

7
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,040
-Yes, I do.
-This is too much.

8
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,240
-Ahalya, what is this nonsense?
-Nonsense?

9
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,510
I could've been killed!

10
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,650
You aren't dead, are you?

11
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,410
Were you trying to kill me?

12
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,650
Ahalya, we're here to enjoy.
Don't spoil our mood. Please go.

13
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,560
I won't leave until you apologize.

14
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,290
Apology?

15
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,760
Apology is given, not demanded.

16
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,460
Ram, take her away.

17
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,070
Hey, why are you dragging him
into this like a coward?

18
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,900
Hey!

19
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,210
I should've ran over you
and made it look like an accident.

20
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,240
I'll kill you.

21
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,080
Oh, really? Come on, kill me!

22
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,080
Ram, just take her away.

23
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,750
-Ahalya, what are you doing?
-You don't support me either, do you?

24
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,990
-Damn.
-No one's going to support you.

25
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,060
Sorry, Nishok. Sorry, Guys.

26
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,600
She's gone.
Let's enjoy the party.

27
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,770
Yay!

28
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,240
I don't feel like partying anymore.

29
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,680
Nishok.

30
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,520
Ahalya.

31
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,260
Ahalya!

32
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,490
There she is.

33
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,100
There you are.

34
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,330
What are you doing here?

35
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,270
Ahalya, why do you let small things
affect you like this?

36
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,310
We've come here to party.
Come on, Ahalya.

37
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,840
You didn't even say a word.

38
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,680
You insulted me in front of everyone.

39
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,320
-Try to understand, Ahalya.
-Just shut up!

40
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,620
Please, Ahalya.

41
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,300
Go slow.

42
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,470
-Go slow, Nishok.
-Fine.

43
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,640
-What happened?
-What happened!

44
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,380
-What was wrong?
-Why did the car stop?

45
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,150
Ahalya, listen to me.
I think you are still mad.

46
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,350
I'll go get some cool drink, okay?

47
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,190
Relax.

48
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,030
It happened again!

49
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,800
What was wrong?

50
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,870
The weather's awesome, isn't it?

51
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,140
-Isn't it thrilling?
-Yes, it is.

52
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,120
Yes.

53
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,870
-Yes! Faster!
-Wow!

54
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,450
What happened?

55
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,630
Hey, what happened?

56
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,430
Why did you scream?

57
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,510
-Oh, no!
-No!

58
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,480
She's dead.

59
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,350
-Ahalya is dead!
-What do we do now?

60
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,420
We have killed Ahalya.
What are we going to do now?

61
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,150
She's dead!
What if someone finds out?

62
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,490
No one's around.
Let's leave this place now.

63
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,260
-Let's get out of here.
-Let's go...

64
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,200
Hey, Ahalya is alive.
Let's take her to a hospital.

65
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,040
Quiet.

66
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,210
What if she dies on the way?
We all will get caught.

67
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,210
Nishok, do something.
I'm really scared.

68
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,050
If my family finds out about this,
they will kill me!

69
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,120
What do we do now!

70
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,490
Hey, she's going to die anyway.
Let's put an end to this.

71
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,960
-Are you going to kill her?
-We don't have a choice!

72
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,160
Otherwise, we will be in deep shit.
She's dying anyway.

73
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,470
What are you saying!

74
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,170
It's going to be mercy killing.
Look, how she's suffering.

75
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,970
There's no other option!
Our lives are at stake here!

76
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,310
Fine. Tell me if you have a better idea.
You!

77
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,780
How about you! Come on!

78
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,020
-Nishok, think.
-Please think.

79
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,420
-This is the only way out.
-Nishok, no! Don't do it.

80
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,690
Nishok, please don't kill me.

81
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,230
Nishok, let me live.
Please don't kill me.

82
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,200
Please don't do it.
She's helpless.

83
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,800
Please no.

84
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,440
I want to live.
Please help me, Nishok.

85
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,240
Nishok, please.

86
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,550
Stop staring and come hold her.

87
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,590
Come on!

88
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,420
Preethi, hold her.

89
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,230
Come here now!

90
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,500
-Please don't do it.
-Please.

91
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,640
Hold her tight.

92
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,560
Ahalya?

93
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,500
What have you guys done!

94
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,330
Ahalya.

95
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,830
Ahalya.

96
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,700
Why did you kill her?

97
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,970
-We didn't do it.
-Why?

98
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,440
We didn't kill her.

99
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,440
Ram, we didn't do it intentionally.
Please trust us.

100
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,150
-She didn't say anything wrong.
-We didn't kill her.

101
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,650
-It was an accident.
-Yes.

102
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,350
We didn't do it on purpose.
Please understand.

103
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,790
It was really an accident.
We didn't do it deliberately.

104
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,320
-You don't qualify to be humans.
-Ram!

105
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,690
Please try to understand.
We didn't do it on purpose.

106
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,600
It was an accident. It really was.

107
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,900
-Ahalya...
-Someone's coming.

108
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,340
Ram, look, please tell them
it was an accident.

109
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,610
I beg you.
Otherwise, our lives will be destroyed.

110
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,050
Please tell them it's an accident.
I'm telling the truth.

111
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,450
-We are innocents.
-Ram, I'm telling the truth.

112
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,450
-Tell them it was an accident, please.
-Please try to understand.

113
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,060
-Ram, they are approaching.
-Ram, please listen to us.

114
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,030
Ram, our lives
are at stake here, please...

115
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,060
Who are you people?
And why are you crying?

116
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,230
Sir, it was an accident...

117
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,570
You rogue, why did you kill her!

118
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,340
Sir, look what he has done to her.

119
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:07,150
-Why did you kill her!
-He has murdered a helpless woman.

120
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,480
Let me go.

121
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,750
Idiot. Bastard!

122
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,290
He should be taught a lesson.

123
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,350
Hey, what happened?
Did the bike skid?

124
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,780
-Poor guy
-Did anyone come in your way?

125
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,180
He's injured.

126
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,730
Are you going to upload it on Facebook?

127
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,730
Would you have taken selfie
if it was your brother?

128
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,070
Did anyone call 108?

129
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,910
No. Someone please call the number.

130
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,140
Ashwath, lift him up
and start the car!

131
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,080
Have some water.

132
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,820
What's with these guys?
Taking selfies with an injured man?

133
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,390
-Hello, Kiran.
-Tell me.

134
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,390
-I'll be late today.
-What's the matter?

135
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,930
A road accident.
Going to a nearby hospital...

136
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,130
You will be late for the meeting!

137
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,740
Kiran, is that meeting
more important than someone's life?

138
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,470
-This meeting is very important.
-This is a fact, trust me.

139
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,770
-How can I come?
-All right.

140
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,110
Faster, please.

141
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,450
Brother, please don't mind.

142
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,590
This is for the proof.

143
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,300
Hi.

144
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,770
Good morning.

145
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,100
One minute.

146
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,370
Excuse me.
Preethi, Preethi, Preethi, Preethi...

147
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,310
-Preethi.
-What?

148
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,840
Preethi, here everyone knows

149
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,350
if I come across anything
different or beautiful,

150
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,280
I will capture it immediately.

151
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,550
Today, you're looking quite...

152
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,850
-Preethi
-Well...

153
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,090
-Come here.
-You were saying something.

154
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,630
You look very pretty today.

155
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,800
-So--
-Don't you have manners?

156
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,900
How many times have I told you
not to wear my clothes?

157
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,030
You neither take bath
nor brush your teeth. Disgusting!

158
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,910
Okay. You can take the picture.

159
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,840
I forgot to charge my mobile.
Sorry, see you later.

160
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,050
Nancy, you haven't completed
the work yet.

161
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,490
Then why the hell
you took leave yesterday?

162
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,890
Kiran, my uncle
had a mild heart attack.

163
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,660
-That's why I took leave.
-Uh-oh.

164
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,530
Hey, Nancy, you went on a date
with Rocky last evening, right?

165
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,970
You got so many likes on FB. Superb.

166
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,770
People run back to work
When Monday comes

167
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,180
This is the land of IT-BT
Oh, God, help us

168
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:05,880
Holding a laptop in his hand
He goes to the office looking sharp

169
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,690
Don't worry about this
It’s a never ending cycle

170
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,230
In the whole week
we are free for just a day

171
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,800
There’s work the whole week
Why is there only one weekend

172
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:26,510
There’s work the whole week
Why is there only one weekend

173
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,110
People run back to work
When Monday comes

174
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,480
This is the land of IT-BT
Oh, God, help us

175
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,980
Holding a laptop in his hand

176
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,320
He goes to the office looking sharp

177
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,020
Don't worry about this
It’s a never ending cycle

178
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,430
In the whole week
we are free for just a day

179
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,770
There’s work the whole week
Why is there only one weekend

180
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:01,140
There’s work the whole week
Why is there only one weekend

181
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,290
Putting all your worries aside
Getting up and getting ready

182
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,660
Without eating breakfast
I ran to the office

183
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,000
The lift didn’t work
So I took the stairs and ran

184
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,570
But by the time I reached
I was already an hour late

185
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,340
The team leader was tensed

186
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,040
The manager was tense

187
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,770
The database was lost

188
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,570
My case was also gone

189
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,610
Even at noon
Still short on sleep

190
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,950
If you want to live
You can't be idle

191
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,350
By the time I wake up
The traffic will be at its peak

192
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,960
Start finding shortcuts

193
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:57,300
Even the school kids
Make faces at me

194
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,870
I’m a human
For me, tension is common

195
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,640
I lost my teenage
In managing my life

196
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,970
Life is a fight
We need to constantly look out

197
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,510
Life is nothing but
Snakes and Ladders game

198
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,780
The salary we get isn’t enough

199
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,320
And the weekend party never ends

200
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,750
There’s work the whole week

201
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,190
Why is there only one weekend?

202
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,590
There’s work the whole week

203
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,100
Why is there only one weekend?

204
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,830
There’s work the whole week

205
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,200
Why is there only one weekend?

206
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,270
There’s work the whole week

207
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,680
Why is there only one weekend?

208
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,150
-We're running late.
-Okay...

209
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,460
There he is.

210
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,930
-Hello, Brothers!
-We're dead meat.

211
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,370
How many more days do you need
to vacate the house?

212
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,300
Sir, we're still looking for a house.

213
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,270
-So, you're still looking?
-Yes, sir...

214
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,770
When will you vacate?

215
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,510
-Sir, in ten days.
-Ten days!

216
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,010
I'm sick and tired
of telling you to vacate the house

217
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,950
for the last three months.

218
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,950
When will you vacate?

219
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,750
Hey! Shut the heck up.

220
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,490
-Stop sounding like a broken record.
-Nishok.

221
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,820
Take your hands off!

222
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,990
-We will not vacate.
-Oh, is that so?

223
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,400
When are you going to vacate?

224
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,540
Stop it!

225
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,210
One day.

226
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,320
We'll vacate the house in a day.
Please go.

227
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,190
Go. Get out of here.

228
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,230
Sir, please find a house by tomorrow.

229
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,000
Sure, he will.

230
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,270
Mom, I'm busy tomorrow.

231
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,340
Yes, she is.

232
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,680
He kept us waiting for so long.

233
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,820
Looks like you've been
waiting for a long time.

234
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,920
-Not at all.
-Just for an hour.

235
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,250
There's nothing wrong in waiting.

236
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,590
You guys didn't find a house, did you?

237
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,230
RR Nagar, Best Club.

238
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,530
There's a superb house
at the dead end.

239
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,170
Fully furnished.
Rent is reasonable too.

240
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,170
Best Club? Dead end?

241
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,170
Are you talking about House No.13
with the big gate?

242
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,550
Yes.

243
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,190
How do you know about that house?

244
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,250
Never mind that.
What do you know about that house?

245
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,560
Do you know the history
of that house?

246
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:12,690
Stop blabbering.

247
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,200
The house he's talking about is...

248
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,970
Let me go.

249
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,110
-Hey, get out of here.
-Mom.

250
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,820
In that house,

251
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,920
a father, a mother and a daughter
three people lived there.

252
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,530
He tortured and tormented them
every single day.

253
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,070
As the days went by,

254
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,800
he started torturing them more.

255
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,210
He brought prostitutes home.

256
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:06,350
When his wife protested, he killed her
in front of their daughter.

257
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,050
He then kept her daughter
captive in a room

258
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,950
and isolated her
from the outer world.

259
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,960
Then he went crazy

260
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,630
and started torturing his own daughter.

261
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:28,000
The loneliness and the tortures

262
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,300
gradually turned her into a psycho.

263
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,510
One day, she killed her father
when he was in an inebriated state.

264
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,580
The rage in her didn't die down
even after killing him.

265
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,250
She lived with her
father's corpse for days

266
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,920
without food and died
out of starvation.

267
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,490
People say that girl's spirit

268
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,730
still lives in that house.

269
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,500
Why can't we try something different?

270
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,610
Different?

271
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,980
He has told me this before.

272
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,610
Do you have a place
for us to stay tonight?

273
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,010
Can we stay in a lodge with girls?

274
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,050
Don't be stupid!

275
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,390
There are people around.
Keep it low.

276
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,020
Preethi, why couldn't you
find a house?

277
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,760
They don't approve of co-ed living.

278
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,030
Do you get it?

279
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,330
-What I'm trying to say is...
-Don't say anything.

280
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,030
Can we get a better house
than this in the city?

281
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,270
I worked really hard
to find this house.

282
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,770
Fools.

283
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,370
Watch your words.

284
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,040
Whatever said and done,
I'm going to move into that house.

285
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,710
Whoever is interested, can join me.

286
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,780
Hey, come on, let's go with him.

287
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,450
We don't have any other option.

288
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,290
We must vacate the house tomorrow.

289
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,920
We are ready to go.

290
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,890
-What is your problem?
-We can't move into that haunted house!

291
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,000
Karthik, the ghost in that house

292
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,430
will run away
due to our torments and tortures.

293
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,670
Okay?

294
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,940
I think five of us
can handle that ghost.

295
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,410
Sir, bill.

296
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:24,320
Hey, I get jitters
when I think about that house.

297
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,820
But that bigmouth...

298
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,350
When will you vacate?

299
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,360
We'll be better off with the ghost.

300
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,060
Don't know what will happen
to us tomorrow.

301
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,940
Where are you taking me?

302
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,840
Just come with me.

303
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,940
It's a very big house.
Who owns it?

304
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,880
-It doesn't matter. It's ours tonight.
-Oh, really?

305
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:01,090
I'll buy this if I win a jackpot.
Then you can be the queen of this house.

306
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,060
-This house is really nice.
-That's why I brought you here.

307
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,600
Come in.

308
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,300
-There is no power.
-We don't need power.

309
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,270
Hey, stop it.

310
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,510
Come on, you stop doing that.

311
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,720
-There he is. Hello, sir.
-Hello.

312
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,860
Take the keys. Thank you, sir.

313
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,730
You just got the keys.

314
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,760
-Then how come you...
-I told you what he said to me.

315
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,970
Don't worry about it.

316
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,630
How is the house?

317
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,900
-Fantastic.
-Superb.

318
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,350
Come in.

319
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,230
Unbelievable. It looks like a palace.

320
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,630
I'm in trouble.

321
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,570
-It's so nice.
-What's with you?

322
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,870
House looks terrific from inside.

323
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,840
Yes, it's terrifying.
Let's go from here.

324
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,880
-I mean, inside.
-Go.

325
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,210
Check out the bathroom.
I'm sure it'll be horrifying.

326
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,280
This rogue never listens to me.

327
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,720
Stop messing with him.

328
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,390
Careful.

329
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,690
This house is definitely haunted

330
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,820
by a spirit of a female.

331
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,590
Hold this. Wait, this one too...

332
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,110
At least, keep this house clean.

333
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,410
Tell this to that monkey.

334
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,810
-Whom did you call monkey?
-You, who else?

335
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,650
I'll take care of you later.

336
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,990
-Nancy, I'll eat this fish someday.
-Get lost.

337
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,090
-Do you ever stop eating?
-It's a fruit.

338
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,590
You never stop eating.

339
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,500
It's quite good today.
A lot better than yesterday.

340
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,740
-You're always eating.
-I'm on a diet.

341
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,580
-Karthik.
-Yeah.

342
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,020
Is this the family you spoke about?

343
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,590
Just by looking at his face,
I feel like killing him.

344
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,520
I pity these two innocents.

345
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,430
Is this little girl the ghost?

346
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,000
I can handle her single-handedly.

347
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,660
What are you guys doing over there?

348
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,670
-Looking at the family photo.
-Is that your family?

349
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,670
Throw it away.

350
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,640
-Why do you look so scared?
-No, I'm not.

351
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,310
Getting scared isn't good.

352
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,580
It's even worse to scare others
by being scared.

353
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,810
I'm not scared.

354
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,010
But your face says so!

355
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,080
You know, I heard something.

356
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,420
-You heard something?
-Yes.

357
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,550
Come, I'll show you
the picture as well.

358
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,920
-Come dear.
-Is it a new movie?

359
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,670
Hey, where is the video?
What are you doing?

360
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,810
Are we going to play chess?
We could've played in the hall.

361
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,580
This is Ouija Board, not a chessboard.

362
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,450
I don't know how to play this game.

363
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,890
This game is not between you and me.
It is between us and ghost.

364
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,450
What, ghost?

365
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:39,690
-There are so many ghosts around us--
-Why are you talking like that?

366
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,430
In this game, I'm supposed to.

367
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,330
Just shut up and listen to me.

368
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,900
There are so many spirits around us.

369
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:55,170
It could be anywhere.
It could be behind you.

370
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,980
This coin plays an important role
in this game.

371
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,090
The coin will stop at 'Yes'
if this house is haunted.

372
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,060
Otherwise, will it stop at 'No'?

373
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,890
-The coin will not move, idiot!
-Yes, you're right.

374
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,000
I feel uneasy in my stomach.

375
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,600
If you run away when the ghost appears
then your life will be in danger.

376
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,610
-Be brave, okay?
-Okay.

377
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,010
-Shall we summon?
-Yes...

378
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,340
Good spirit, come.

379
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,710
Good spirit, come.

380
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,680
-Good spirit, come.
-Come. Come.

381
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,550
-Good spirit, come.
-Good spirit, come.

382
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,820
Good spirit, come...

383
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,730
I am calling good spirit

384
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,670
Good spirit, come.

385
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,040
Good spirit, come.

386
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,910
Good spirit, come.

387
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,310
Good spirit, come...

388
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:11,020
Good spirit, come.

389
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,150
Good spirit, come.

390
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,020
Good spirit, come.

391
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,190
Good spirit, come.

392
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,920
Good spirit, come.

393
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,330
Good spirit, come.

394
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,130
Good spirit, come.

395
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,560
Good spirit, come.

396
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,170
Good spirit, come.

397
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,870
Good spirit, come.

398
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,240
Good spirit, come.
Good spirit, come.

399
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,700
-What are you guys up to?
-I thought of scaring Karthik a bit.

400
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:05,340
Well, you play such pranks
and accuse him of being scared.

401
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,110
-Look at him
-Hey?

402
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,340
-Hey, it is me.
-That's why I was scared.

403
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,610
Ghosts don't scare me.

404
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,420
Are you done?
We have to go to the office tomorrow.

405
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,850
I have to find an excuse for today's off.

406
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,420
Hey, what board is this?

407
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,860
-Ouija Board.
-Damn this board.

408
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,130
I was expecting a visual spectacle.

409
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,230
Did I make a fool of myself?

410
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,970
-Hello.
-Hello, I'm Divya. Can I talk to Dinesh?

411
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,710
-Dinesh?
-Yes.

412
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,810
Nobody by that name lives here.
Sorry, wrong number--

413
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,610
Don't lie to me.

414
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,720
Dinesh and I used to talk all night
on this number.

415
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,350
We haven't spoken
for three months now.

416
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,520
-Please give the phone to him.
-Hello.

417
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,890
We moved in here today.

418
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,130
I don't know who lived here before.

419
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,360
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

420
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,400
I called up this number
to talk to Dinesh.

421
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,370
Please don't mind.
I'm so sorry.

422
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,040
That's all right. Would you mind
if I ask you something?

423
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,240
Go ahead.

424
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,050
You said you would
speak with him all night, right?

425
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,120
Then why didn't you
talk for three months?

426
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,450
You know what?

427
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,590
Three months back,
I died in a car accident.

428
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,260
I couldn't talk to him after that.

429
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,800
What did you say?
I couldn't hear you properly.

430
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,130
-Please say it again.
-Are you dumb or what!

431
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,340
I died three months ago!

432
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,060
Hey! Hey, Karthik.

433
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,100
What is it?

434
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,470
A girl named Divya called
and she asked for Dinesh.

435
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,740
Then she said she died months ago.

436
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,340
Oh, I see.

437
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,570
It was a dream.

438
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,480
But it seemed real.

439
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,350
Stop it.
Shut up and go back to sleep.

440
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,920
You ruined my sleep.

441
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,860
Hey! Where is my phone?

442
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,230
It's downstairs!

443
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,460
Let's get it.
Come with me.

444
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,000
Get lost.

445
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,040
-Karthik. Hey.
-Hey!

446
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,100
-Hello?
-Divya accepted my Facebook request, dude.

447
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,340
Shut up and hang up!

448
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,960
Who is it?

449
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,370
Who's there?

450
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,450
Karthik!

451
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,060
You?

452
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,060
Why did you scream?

453
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,170
Hey! He asked you a question.

454
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,440
-Why did you scream?
-I just felt like screaming.

455
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,370
-Are you drunk?
-No.

456
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,110
Then why did you scream?

457
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,810
I already told you.
I just felt like doing it.

458
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,610
No one can change you.

459
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,950
He ruined my sleep completely.

460
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,560
-Now why did you scream?
-I felt like doing it too.

461
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,200
I'm going to...

462
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,500
They want to know why I screamed...

463
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,850
-Hey, Fatso.
-What is it?

464
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,990
I'll kill you if you scream again.

465
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:13,670
[praying]

466
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:16,340
Oh, God, protect me from all evils.

467
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,010
What's up, Bro?
Do you know why I screamed?

468
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,180
-Why?
-I saw your dead body downstairs!

469
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,510
Super, super, super.

470
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,250
Joke of the night.

471
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,890
He's very much alive.
Whose dead body was it then?

472
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,350
-Hello.-Hello. I'm Divya. Is Dinesh there?

473
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,940
-Nancy
-What is it?

474
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,850
I think I saw someone
standing near the mirror.

475
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,780
Such things happen
at new places.

476
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,280
Turn off the light
and go back to sleep.

477
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,620
They are screaming.

478
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,660
-What happened?
-Under the cot.

479
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,330
There's something over there.
Please check.

480
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,840
Don't be scared.

481
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:22,180
-Nothing's there.
-No, Nishok.

482
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,680
We saw something. We saw something.

483
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,420
Something's there. Something's there!

484
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:34,130
-There's nothing.
-It was right next to me.

485
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,060
It looked hideous.

486
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,200
Someone's here too, not just us.
Didn't I tell you before?

487
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:44,540
Cut it out!
There's no one. Go see for yourself.

488
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,240
-Is anything there?
-You know...

489
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:52,780
Listen to me carefully.
If you don't stop this right now

490
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:55,150
I'll turn into a ghost
and kill you all.

491
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,420
-Hey!
-Get out of my way.

492
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:06,530
What's the matter?
Who screamed?

493
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,830
What is this? How come
you are wearing different clothes?

494
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,500
Different clothes?
When did I come here?

495
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,900
A few seconds before,
you were here.

496
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:19,510
Now you have come
in a different outfit.

497
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,710
What's wrong with you?

498
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,010
-He was screaming like a lunatic.
-I'm not a lunatic.

499
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,150
I saw his dead body downstairs.
That's why I screamed.

500
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,390
Nishok, I spoke to the girl
whom he saw in his dream.

501
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,290
Superb. Great performance.

502
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,890
I was sleeping in the next room.
Why didn't I hear anything?

503
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,570
You picked the room with good vibes
and made us sleep in the bad ones.

504
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,540
You're really an idiot.

505
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,210
Sound. Sound.

506
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:55,710
Did you hear that?

507
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,080
Bad omen.

508
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,430
Who is there?

509
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:23,700
Who's out there?

510
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,120
-Who is it?
-There's no one.

511
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,820
-I'm really scared.
-Don't be. I'm here.

512
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,370
Sorry.

513
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:56,300
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

514
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,570
I'll kill you.

515
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,580
Nishok, be careful.

516
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,420
Who's there?

517
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,030
Who knocked on the door?

518
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,900
No one's here.

519
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,540
Get up.

520
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,720
Karthik, get the torch.

521
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,830
-You mean, me? Please come with me.
-Now!

522
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,860
-Okay.
-Please come.

523
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,870
Take it.

524
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,280
Who's there?

525
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,300
Nishok, don't go.
Nishok, don't go over there.

526
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:08,300
Nishok, don't go near that.
Nishok. Nishok.

527
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,440
Nishok, don't do it...

528
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,010
Nishok!

529
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,220
Hey! It looks like a doll
from a horror film.

530
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,860
Throw it away!

531
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,930
Throw it off.

532
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:11,600
What's going on here?
Who is knocking at this hour?

533
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:16,900
-That wailing sound...
-I told you. There's something...

534
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,210
-Who is it?
-No, Nishok!

535
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,880
-No!
-Nishok, no!

536
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:31,610
Not me. I didn't do it.

537
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,630
Don't do it.

538
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,900
Who's there?

539
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,780
Who is it?

540
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,450
Who's out there?

541
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,540
Who is it?

542
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,360
Nishok!

543
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,130
I'm really scared.
Please let get inside.

544
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,460
Yes, Nishok, let's get inside.

545
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:03,940
You guys were right.

546
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:10,940
Something's terribly wrong
with this house.

547
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:14,250
Damn you! That's what he's been
saying all along.

548
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,720
Stop staring at people
who talk back.

549
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,830
-Karthik!
-Hey, Karthik!

550
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:40,670
Hey!

551
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:45,210
Hey, what are you doing in there?

552
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,680
Karthik.

553
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,670
-Hey, what the hell you are doing?
-Karthik!

554
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:15,740
-What's wrong with you?
-Have you gone mad!

555
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,210
Stop it!

556
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,980
This doll is behind all this.
I know I've watched it in movies.

557
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,580
I'm going to kill you.

558
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,420
Where is Ashwath!

559
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,490
He was right here!

560
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,030
Ashwath.

561
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,500
Where is Ashwath?

562
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,700
Ashwath is missing.

563
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,440
Ashwath.

564
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:48,770
Ashwath.

565
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,710
Ashwath.

566
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:51,910
Ashwath.

567
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,130
Ashwath.

568
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,330
Ashwath.

569
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:20,610
Ashwath.

570
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:23,280
Ashwath.

571
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,780
Hey Ashwath.

572
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,280
Ashwath.

573
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,080
Ashwath, where are you?

574
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:38,090
Ashwath.

575
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,660
Ashwath.

576
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,470
Why did you scream?
What happened?

577
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,550
-Ashwath...
-Ashwath...

578
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:02,650
-Ashwath, what happened?
-What happened?

579
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,680
-Ashwath...
-Ashwath, get up.

580
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,850
Ashwath! What has happened to him?

581
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,720
-Ashwath.
-Ashwath, what happened to you?

582
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,560
Ashwath, say something.

583
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,240
Nishok. Nishok.

584
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:25,500
Nishok.

585
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:28,010
Where are you guys?

586
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:30,840
Please help me.

587
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:32,340
Ashwath.

588
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:33,880
-Nishok!
-Ashwath.

589
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,680
-Ashwath.-Karthik!

590
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,680
-What happened?-Preethi.

591
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,650
-Please hurry up.
-Ashwath's voice.

592
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,990
Upstairs. I'll go check.

593
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,040
Ashwath.

594
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:02,240
Hey, Ashwath!

595
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:06,280
Where is Ashwath?

596
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:01,770
I'll check downstairs.

597
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,080
-Ashwath is missing.
-Where did he go?

598
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,160
Blood.

599
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,780
Oh, no.

600
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,340
Ashwath!

601
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,670
-Ashwath.
-Nishok!

602
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:25,920
Hey!

603
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,120
Karthik.

604
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:30,490
What happened?

605
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:32,490
Karthik!

606
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,000
Karthik.

607
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:39,830
Karthik, what happened?

608
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,470
Karthik, what happened?
Please say something.

609
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:48,970
Please talk to me, Karthik.

610
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,620
Nishok. Nishok.

611
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,090
Preethi?

612
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:09,030
Preethi!

613
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,860
-Hey, Preethi.
-Nishok.

614
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,270
Preethi, what happened to you?

615
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,200
We made a mistake, Nishok.

616
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:21,940
-We made a mistake...
-What are you talking about?

617
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:24,080
She is not going to spare us.

618
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:27,010
We all are going to die.

619
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:30,250
We are going to die.
We shouldn't have come here, Nishok.

620
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:33,620
-We shouldn't have...
-Preethi.

621
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:35,550
Preethi, get up.

622
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,390
Preethi.

623
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,390
Preethi? What happened to you.

624
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,430
Talk to me, Preethi.

625
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,640
Nancy?

626
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:21,730
-Nancy.
-Didn't I tell you!

627
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:24,300
Didn't I tell you?

628
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,340
This is my house.

629
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,370
Didn't I tell you to not come here?

630
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:37,480
Nishok.

631
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,290
Please help me, Nishok.

632
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,260
-Nancy.
-Please help me, Nishok!

633
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,400
Please help me, Nishok.

634
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,570
Please help me, Nishok!

635
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,000
Nishok, It's me, Nancy.
Open the door.

636
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,370
Nishok, open the door.

637
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:10,750
Didn't I tell you
to not come here!

638
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:14,390
Then why did you come!

639
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:33,040
Nishok, please take me
out of this house.

640
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:36,710
I'm really scared.

641
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,910
Nancy, I'm scared too.

642
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,580
I'm scared to come near you.

643
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,030
Nishok, are you scared?

644
01:02:58,330 --> 01:02:59,900
Didn't you say that ghosts
don't exist!

645
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,100
Nancy.

646
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:05,170
But you look exhausted!
You're trembling.

647
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,350
Did you see his face?

648
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:27,990
Oh, no...

649
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,260
Hello.

650
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:33,570
We thought of stretching this
for three more days.

651
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,870
You are nothing but a coward.

652
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:42,540
Nishok, you spoke
so bravely that day.

653
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:46,480
But you looked shit-scared.

654
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:50,450
Now you know the fear of ghosts.

655
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:55,750
Switch off all the lights.
He's glowing out of fear.

656
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,430
Hey, we all did it together.
Why only kick me?

657
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,890
-Just a minute.
-Give me that!

658
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,730
Wait a minute.
I admit that you fooled me.

659
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:08,930
When we all were upstairs,
who knocked on the door?

660
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:12,440
And what about that horrible screams?

661
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,870
How did the doll, which I threw out,
come in the house?

662
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:20,010
When he was down wounded,
we heard his voice from upstairs.

663
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:24,050
What about her voice?
How did she change it?

664
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,720
How was it?

665
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:27,520
It's all staged, Nishok.

666
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,660
Mimicry Shankar asked
if he could stay with us for a few days.

667
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:32,590
So, we availed his service as well.

668
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,090
Oh, I see.

669
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,660
How am I going to face people
in the office tomorrow?

670
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,300
Damn it!

671
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,070
Where is Shankar?

672
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,970
He must be somewhere around.

673
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,770
Ashwath, call him.

674
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,480
-You were really scared.
-How could you...

675
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,310
Shankar, where are you?

676
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,720
Sorry, bro.
I couldn't make it today.

677
01:04:57,950 --> 01:04:59,920
Shall we postpone it to tomorrow?

678
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,560
What!

679
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:06,360
What did you just say!

680
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,090
I'm sorry. I couldn't come today.

681
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:10,130
Shankar.

682
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,500
-Shankar.-Sorry, Guys.

683
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,800
Something came up
and I got busy with it.

684
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:25,110
Did I scare the shit out of you all?
I'm on the terrace.

685
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:26,610
Come.

686
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,910
You, idiot. I will...

687
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:32,050
-Stay right there. We are coming.
-Idiot.

688
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,320
Stay right there!

689
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:34,650
I'll skin you alive.

690
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,020
I'm going to kill him.

691
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,160
Shankar.

692
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,160
-Shankar.
-Where are you, Shankar?

693
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:42,460
-Shankar.
-Where did he go?

694
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:43,860
Shankar.

695
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,130
Shankar!

696
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:50,100
Shankar!

697
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,640
Shankar.

698
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,610
Shankar...

699
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:01,750
Shankar.

700
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,420
Is it a part of your prank too?

701
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,090
-What is this!
-I really don't know.

702
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,460
Shankar...

703
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,160
-Shankar...
-Shankar...

704
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,630
-Shankar...
-Hold him.

705
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:20,270
Shankar.

706
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,630
Shankar!

707
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,940
He's not breathing.
What did you do to him?

708
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,770
Shankar is dead!

709
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,080
Hey! Speak up!

710
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,810
Shankar. Shankar. Shankar.

711
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:39,480
-Shankar...
-You guys killed him!

712
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,690
There's a letter.

713
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:47,890
Hi friends, your game has ended.

714
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,700
My game has begun.

715
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:55,700
Now the time is 12 a.m.

716
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:57,340
Shankar is dead.

717
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:01,340
Next person will die at 12:30 a.m.

718
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:07,250
What's going on here?
Who wrote this?

719
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,860
What have we done
to get killed, anyway?

720
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,860
Let us go from here now.

721
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:24,030
How can we go?
Our friend is dead!

722
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,800
Who the hell did this!

723
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:27,830
Let's get out of here now.

724
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,040
It's a murder!

725
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:33,340
-Come on.
-Let's get out of here...

726
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,770
Illusion and desire are invisible

727
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,940
Then why the search?

728
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:13,550
No one knows destiny's game

729
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,850
Then why the struggle?

730
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:20,190
I'll follow you like a shadow

731
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,290
And snatch your life
That's the truth

732
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,760
I'll never ever leave you!

733
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:03,200
Wherever you are
And whatever you do

734
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,500
Your death awaits you

735
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:09,800
The blood stains of the darkest sins

736
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:13,240
Search them within you

737
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,140
Come, see for yourself

738
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:19,550
Come and fight

739
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:23,220
I'll never ever leave you.

740
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,420
I'm unable to turn my phone on.

741
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,560
-Me too.
-I can't either.

742
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:34,390
We are going to die.
We are trapped!

743
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,260
My phone is working!

744
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,530
Call someone.

745
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,420
It's gone.
We're stuck here forever.

746
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:08,260
I kept saying we shouldn't
come here.

747
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:12,830
One of us is dead
because of you.

748
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:14,730
-You're responsible.
-What did I do?

749
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:16,570
Who told you to prank me?

750
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,910
He's dead because of your silly games!

751
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:23,010
Oh, really? Is that so!

752
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,740
He died because of your stupid ego!

753
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,280
Your stubbornness killed him!

754
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,320
-Say it again.
-Nishok!

755
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:34,020
Talk to me.

756
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,460
Stop it! Stop it!

757
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:38,760
Please stop fighting.

758
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:41,430
Let us focus on
how to get out of here.

759
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,390
Damn it!

760
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:44,260
Shall we all go to the terrace?

761
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,410
The door is open.

762
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:10,390
We are going to die. We are going to die.

763
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:12,790
Don't be scared, Nancy.
We will be fine.

764
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:15,630
How can I not be scared?
One of us is dead!

765
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:20,100
-We're going to die too.
-No, we are not, Nancy.

766
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:21,730
No, we are!

767
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,740
There's something here.
We all are going to die.

768
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,310
That's not true, Nancy.
We will get out of this place.

769
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:31,610
Then get me out of here, Karthik.
Get me out of here, Karthik!

770
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,810
Stop acting like a mad person!

771
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:35,510
And allow me to think.

772
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,180
Yes, I'm insane!

773
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:39,750
I want to get out of here.
I'm going out!

774
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:42,890
-Nancy, stop.
-Nancy, don't go.

775
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:43,890
Nishok.

776
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,290
-Nancy, please listen to us.
-Nancy...

777
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:51,600
Nancy, stop acting like you're possessed.

778
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,270
Don't be scared.
Everybody stay here.

779
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:35,540
-Nishok.
-Karthik, pass me the torchlight.

780
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,610
I already gave it to you.

781
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,780
I found a candle.

782
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,080
Nancy.

783
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:48,290
-Karthik.
-Don't yell. I'm right behind you.

784
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,420
Nancy.

785
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:51,690
Ashwath.

786
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:54,460
Preethi

787
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:55,890
where are you?

788
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,000
Preethi.

789
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:01,170
Nishok!

790
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,340
-Where are Nancy and Ashwath?
-Don't know.

791
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:12,540
-Ashwath.
-I'm behind you.

792
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,780
Help me, Nishok.

793
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,910
-Help me, Nishok.
-Nancy.

794
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,250
-Help me, Nishok.
-Nancy!

795
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,720
-Nancy!
-Nancy.

796
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:22,750
-Nancy.
-Nancy.

797
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,460
Help me, Nishok.

798
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,460
-Nancy.
-Help me, Nishok.

799
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:28,090
-Nancy.
-Nancy.

800
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:31,060
Help me, Nishok.
Help me, Nishok.

801
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:43,580
-Nancy!
-Nancy!

802
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:47,010
Nishok, switch on the lights now!

803
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,720
-Switch on the light!
-I'm unable to turn it on!

804
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:41,600
-Nancy...
-Nancy...

805
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:43,070
-Nancy.
-Nancy.

806
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,870
-Nancy, please get up.
-Nancy.

807
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,270
Nancy.

808
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:52,110
Nancy.

809
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:54,650
Oh, my God!

810
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:58,420
I should have listened to you.
It's all my fault.

811
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,890
-I made a very big mistake.
-Nancy.

812
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:04,690
Nishok, you're responsible
for Nancy's death!

813
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,930
Hey!

814
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:13,070
Never imagined this would happen.

815
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:17,270
How would I know?

816
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,960
We are done.

817
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,730
We are finished!

818
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,420
Hello! Hello!

819
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:45,950
-Hello!
-Can he hear us!

820
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:47,590
-Over here.
-Louder!

821
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,450
Help!

822
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:49,790
Hello!

823
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,160
Louder, please!

824
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:53,630
-I am...
-Keep shouting.

825
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:55,360
Brother! Hello.

826
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:58,260
Stop! Stop!

827
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,900
-Hurry up.
-Throw this letter out.

828
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:05,700
-Sir, paper!
-Throw it out.

829
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,110
Can you see the paper?

830
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,140
-Hello!
-Did you throw it out?

831
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,780
Brother, over here...

832
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:14,380
Brother!

833
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,180
-Ashwath.
-Ashwath!

834
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:21,120
Ashwath...

835
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:23,820
Ashwath, what happened?

836
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:26,490
Don't worry. We are here for you.

837
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:28,560
Preethi, get a Band-Aid now!

838
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,030
Ashwath, you will be all right.

839
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:35,000
We are there for you, Ashwath.
You will be all right.

840
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,270
You will be fine.

841
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:42,670
Ashwath.

842
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:48,850
You will be okay.

843
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,550
Nishok. Nishok.

844
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:04,260
I won't let that happen.
I won't let anyone else die!

845
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,270
I won't let anyone die.

846
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,790
-I'm going to kill you.
-Nishok, don't go...

847
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:36,230
Don't move.

848
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,700
-Karthik.
-Yes, I'm still alive.

849
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,770
Preethi?

850
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:45,240
I'm really very scared, Nishok.

851
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:47,840
Ashwath.

852
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:52,440
-Ashwath.
-Ashwath.

853
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:55,950
Ashwath.

854
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:01,950
Ashwath.

855
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:04,560
Ashwath.

856
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:06,190
Ashwath.

857
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:07,460
-Ashwath.
-Where are you?

858
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,760
Ashwath.

859
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,910
What happened?

860
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:04,650
Oh, God!

861
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:12,090
Ashwath.

862
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,170
Ashwath!

863
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:23,440
Ashwath.

864
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,370
-Ashwath.
-Ashwath!

865
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,210
Can you hear that?

866
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:55,470
Nishok, it's a phone!

867
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:57,740
Hello.

868
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:59,970
-Let me talk!
-Wait a minute. Hello?

869
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:02,440
-Hello-Turn on the loudspeaker.

870
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:05,040
-Who are you!-Turn on the loudspeaker!

871
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:08,550
Hi, friends.

872
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,380
The game's getting interesting, right?

873
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:11,820
Let's crank it up a bit.

874
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:16,390
The next kill is 15 minutes.

875
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,690
Sir, what have we done to you?

876
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:21,130
I beg you to let us go.

877
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:22,630
Please let us go.

878
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:25,300
I'm begging you. Please.

879
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,640
Hey! Who the hell are you!

880
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:32,470
Don't you have guts!

881
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:34,170
Show yourself if you're a man.

882
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:45,520
Answer the call.

883
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:52,420
Are you scared?

884
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:55,030
You know what?
I really pity you.

885
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:56,460
Here's the clue.

886
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:00,000
One of you three is behind
all these murders.

887
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:07,270
Why are you staring at me?

888
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,380
So you think I'm behind all this?

889
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:16,010
How can you trust him?
Give me the phone!

890
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:25,120
Vishal, it's Nishok.

891
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:28,060
Dad is beating up mom.

892
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:31,260
-Dear, please give the phone to Vishal.-No one stops him.

893
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,370
Dad is beating up mom.

894
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,170
No one stops him.

895
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:40,340
-Dad is beating...
-Hang up and call Vivek!

896
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,780
Vivek, it's Nishok.

897
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:50,480
Dad is beating up mom.

898
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:53,190
No one stops him.

899
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:56,150
-Call 100. They'll surely answer.-No one stops...

900
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:01,930
Dad is beating up mom.

901
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:04,630
No one stops him.

902
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:07,700
Dad is beating up mom.

903
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:10,540
No one stops him.

904
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:13,870
Dad is beating up mom.

905
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,610
No one stops him.

906
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,600
Why?

907
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:48,410
Why did you do this!

908
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:51,240
What did I do!

909
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,810
You're behind everything.
Stop questioning us.

910
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:56,650
You fool!

911
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,450
It's not me. Untie me now!

912
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,920
I know it's not you.
But you brought us all here!

913
01:25:04,090 --> 01:25:06,630
Why is this happening to us!

914
01:25:07,490 --> 01:25:08,930
I did not...

915
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,840
Preethi, we are going to die for sure!

916
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:25,380
Karthik, untie me!

917
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,010
I'm really scared.

918
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,920
Hey! Untie me.

919
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:40,330
There was no power failure.

920
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,860
Nothing happened to us.

921
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:49,400
-Nishok, you're behind all this, right?
-Damn you!

922
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:52,670
I don't know anything.
I swear, it's not me!

923
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:54,310
Untie me first!

924
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:55,940
Don't you really know anything?

925
01:25:56,610 --> 01:26:00,110
Nothing happened to us
after tying you up.

926
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:03,820
I'm going to beat you to death!

927
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:05,280
Untie me now!

928
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,120
Yes, you're very much capable of that...

929
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:09,960
Die!

930
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:17,260
Hey, what's wrong?

931
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,770
Why did you do this?
Please tell me, Nishok.

932
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:39,550
Hey. Hey!

933
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:12,250
You killed Ashwath.
You killed Preethi.

934
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,290
Are you going to kill me too!

935
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,230
Hey! Karthik!

936
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,260
Pull yourself together, Karthik.

937
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:26,600
We both can still get out of here.

938
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:29,740
Who the hell are you!

939
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,540
Who are you!

940
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,040
Who the heck are you!

941
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:36,540
Tell me who are you!

942
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:39,650
Face me if you are a man.
Don't be a coward!

943
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,080
Show yourself!

944
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,780
Karthik, at least, untie me now.
It's not me.

945
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:49,960
Sir, please spare my life.

946
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,490
-Please let me go, sir.
-Karthik!

947
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:56,760
-I'm begging you to spare me.
-Karthik!

948
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,460
Karthik! Karthik!

949
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,400
Stop begging him and untie me now!

950
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:03,140
Sir...

951
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:07,410
You know that it's not me.
Untie me now.

952
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:10,110
Untie me quickly.

953
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,950
-Make it fast.
-I'm doing it!

954
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:14,480
Quick...

955
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:38,440
Karthik. Karthik.

956
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:42,470
Karthik, please get up.
What happened to you?

957
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:45,280
Karthik, talk to me.

958
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:49,180
Please get up, Karthik!

959
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:17,110
Nishok.

960
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:21,980
Nishok, is it confusing?

961
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:24,980
Are you shocked to see me alive?

962
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:27,590
I will not die before killing you!

963
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:33,060
-Ashwath!
-Yes, it's me!

964
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:36,630
Do you know anything
about my past life?

965
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,400
Do you remember Ahalya?

966
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:51,710
-Ahalya
-Ahalya, hello.

967
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,080
Ahalya, hello.

968
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:55,380
-Hello.
-What's the matter?

969
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:59,750
Brother, Nishok was speeding

970
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,320
I would've got killed
if I wasn't alert.

971
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:05,620
-Come home safe.
-Okay, Brother

972
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:08,360
I'm with Ram.
I'll come home early.

973
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:14,930
He's the one who killed her.

974
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:22,140
You can see now.

975
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:45,260
Sir, excuse me.

976
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:47,570
What is it?

977
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:49,130
He laid his hands on a cop.

978
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,870
Lock him up.
Let's teach him a lesson later.

979
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:03,080
-Sir, how about a cup of tea?
-Coming.

980
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:45,260
Sir. Sir!

981
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,980
I know who you are.

982
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:08,580
Are you here to kill me!

983
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:12,520
Take this. And kill me. Kill me!

984
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:16,320
I'm already dead inside.

985
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,990
They killed my Ahalya.

986
01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:24,830
I'm going to make them pay.
I will!

987
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:41,310
Hey!

988
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:50,190
I waited for this day
for a very long time.

989
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,260
Stop staring at me.

990
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:56,530
Do you think you came
to this house on your own?

991
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:00,770
I made you all come here!

992
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:14,680
-I need the keys today.
-You will get it tomorrow.

993
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:22,790
Ashwath, you made a very big mistake.
You've made a blunder.

994
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:28,590
Nishok, you are scared
for your life, aren't you?

995
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:55,390
Sorry, Ashwath.
I really pity you.

996
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,030
You blindly trust people, don't you?

997
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:03,060
Hi, Nishok.

998
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,100
It's been a long time.

999
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:10,300
-How have you been?
-Hey!

1000
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:14,410
How was the game of death?
Did you like it?

1001
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:20,310
Ashwath, you didn't expect
such a twist, did you?

1002
01:34:33,890 --> 01:34:38,360
You're really mad.
I'll get a cool drink for you. Okay?

1003
01:34:55,650 --> 01:34:59,080
-We had great fun last night.
-Hello?

1004
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:15,970
Ahalya.

1005
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,440
What are you doing with my phone?

1006
01:35:20,370 --> 01:35:21,070
What is this?

1007
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:25,180
Ahalya, I can explain.

1008
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:27,910
How many girls
have you betrayed so far?

1009
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:30,420
Give me the phone. I'll explain.

1010
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,780
I trusted you with my life.

1011
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,890
In fact, I told my brother
that you're a gentleman.

1012
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,160
Ahalya, let me explain.

1013
01:35:38,490 --> 01:35:40,260
Don't touch me.

1014
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:43,660
Don't show me your face again.

1015
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:44,900
Get lost!

1016
01:35:47,230 --> 01:35:48,400
Ahalya.

1017
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:49,270
Ahalya!

1018
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:50,970
Just a minute, Ahalya.

1019
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,610
Hear me out, please.

1020
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:02,880
Did you really think
that I was in love with you?

1021
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:14,460
Now that you know about me,
let's have some fun.

1022
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:21,000
How far can you run
in this forest?

1023
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,730
It's going to be fun.

1024
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:45,890
Ram, no! Let me go.

1025
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:47,690
Please let me go.

1026
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:49,560
Let me go.

1027
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:55,200
Hey, shut up!

1028
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,070
Stop it.

1029
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:03,540
I won't!

1030
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,740
I won't let you go!

1031
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:10,650
Help!

1032
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:14,820
Nishok, slow down.

1033
01:37:15,290 --> 01:37:16,690
I heard something.

1034
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:19,490
No...

1035
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:22,900
Pull over.

1036
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:30,270
Hey, don't shout.

1037
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:37,880
Help.

1038
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:39,680
Nothing.

1039
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,690
Ram, let me go!

1040
01:37:49,150 --> 01:37:50,390
Don't shout.

1041
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,400
Help. Help!

1042
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:05,170
Hey!

1043
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:09,170
Hey. Hey!

1044
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:10,640
Who's there?

1045
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:14,510
Nishok. Nishok. Nishok.
I didn't do it on purpose.

1046
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:16,950
-What have you done!
-Ahalya. Ahalya.

1047
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:19,480
-You have killed Ahalya.
-You dirty rogue!

1048
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:21,190
-Why did you kill her?
-Not intentional...

1049
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:23,790
Nishok, it was an accident.
Please trust me.

1050
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:26,060
What? You didn't do it on purpose!

1051
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:29,830
Nishok, I'm begging you.

1052
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:33,970
Please help me.
I didn't do it on purpose. Trust me.

1053
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,530
I'm begging you.

1054
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:39,710
Somebody, please help me.
Someone's approaching. Please...

1055
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:43,410
It was an accident.
Please try to understand.

1056
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:45,340
-Nishok, they are getting closer.
-You killed her.

1057
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:46,950
No, I didn't kill her.
Please help me.

1058
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:48,550
-I'm begging you, please.
-Poor girl.

1059
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:49,950
-Look, I'm touching your feet.
-You're shameless.

1060
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,950
Please help me.
Please trust me.

1061
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:57,020
They are here.
I beg you all to help me.

1062
01:38:57,290 --> 01:38:58,190
You've sinned.

1063
01:38:58,390 --> 01:39:00,160
-Ahalya, please get up.
-Who are you?

1064
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:02,190
-They are here.
-What's wrong? Why are you crying?

1065
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:03,860
Looks like someone's dead.

1066
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:07,570
Sir, it was an accident.

1067
01:39:07,930 --> 01:39:10,100
He killed her and lying
that it was an accident.

1068
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,240
-Die!
-You've killed an innocent person.

1069
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:14,070
Sir, he killed her.

1070
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:18,840
He should be hanged to death.

1071
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:39,800
Did you enjoy the game?

1072
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:40,800
Ram, don't do it.

1073
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:43,040
Listen to me.

1074
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:49,540
Thanks a lot, Ashwath.
You've helped me a lot.

1075
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:52,540
Hey. Hey.

1076
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:07,920
Did you really think
you could save his life?

1077
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:10,120
Hey, do it if you can now!

1078
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:12,120
Don't do it. Listen to me.

1079
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:14,930
Let him go. Don't do it!

1080
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:30,580
Nishok.

1081
01:41:32,610 --> 01:41:33,550
Sorry.

1082
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:44,960
How can you kill so many
people for no reason?

1083
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:48,990
What? What did you just say?

1084
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:51,460
It's good enough reason for me!

1085
01:41:52,730 --> 01:41:55,370
I never went to bed without a girl.

1086
01:41:56,270 --> 01:41:58,570
You made me rot in jail for two years!

1087
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:01,110
Can you imagine
what I went through!

1088
01:42:01,170 --> 01:42:04,480
I waited for this moment
for the last two years.

1089
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:07,810
Spent a lot of time
thinking how to kill you all!

1090
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:17,920
Hello. Where are you?

1091
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:23,560
I got rid of them all.

1092
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,060
Get the car now.

1093
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:28,830
Dad is beating up mom.

1094
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:31,570
No one stops him.

1095
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:34,710
-Hello.
-Dad is beating up mom.

1096
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:37,610
No one stops him.

1097
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:40,880
Dad is beating up mom.

1098
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,580
No one stops him.

1099
01:42:52,190 --> 01:42:55,060
Hey, who are you?

1100
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:56,660
Who's there?

1101
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:47,150
Illusion and desire are invisible

1102
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:50,420
Then why the search?

1103
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:53,650
No one knows destiny's game.

1104
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:57,020
Then why the struggle?

1105
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:00,360
Like the shadow that follows you

1106
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:03,660
I'll snatch your life
and that's the truth

1107
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:07,030
I'll never ever leave you

1108
01:44:40,570 --> 01:44:43,340
Wherever you are
Whatever you do

1109
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:46,670
Your death awaits you

1110
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:49,940
Blood stains of your darkest sins

1111
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:53,210
Search them within yourself

1112
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:56,480
Come..you come!

1113
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:59,750
Come and fight!

1114
01:45:00,390 --> 01:45:03,120
I'll never ever leave you

1115
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:23,210
My hatred
And This thirst for blood

1116
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:26,380
Cannot be quenched by anyone!

1117
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:29,780
My inner side is ghastly!

1118
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:32,990
Once you are here
You will never survive!

1119
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:36,120
Come...you come
Come over

1120
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:39,630
Come and fight

1121
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:43,000
I'll never ever leave you
