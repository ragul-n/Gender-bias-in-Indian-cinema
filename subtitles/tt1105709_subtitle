1
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:13,019
There are some lost memories.

2
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,790
There are some lost thoughts.

3
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,768
lt hurts me all the time.

4
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:26,864
l can't forget it.
lt's haunting me.

5
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:29,808
There are visions. -Yes.

6
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,935

There are visions. -Yes.

13
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:55,792
There are visions. -Yes.

14
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:15,779
There is some intoxication,
some punishment.

15
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:20,953
ls this some problem
or some mistake?

16
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:23,759
Danger of the past events.

17
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:26,789
Danger of other things.

18
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:31,827
Of all the forgotten moments.

19
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:34,736
There are visions.-Yes.

20
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:39,801
There are visions.-Yes.

21
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:42,915
There are visions.-Yes.

22
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,948

There are visions.-Yes.

24
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,856
There are visions.-Yes.

25
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:12,862
What happened, Jai? Tell
me. What happened, Jai?

26
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,754
l'll be there.

27
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:23,739
Hi Wayne.

28
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:24,903
Buddy, why do you
keep coming back?

29
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:27,004
The bears hate you.
-And so do we.

30
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:30,747
All right buddy. You
know the drill.

31
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:33,946
Hands behind your head. And
step away from the trap.

32
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:38,720
Come on.

33
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:55,741
What are you smiling at?

34
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:58,740
No evidence. No crime.

35
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,767
Freaking mad man.

36
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:57,961
Well, call me for the funeral.

37
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:00,796
Come on. lt's almost
been four minutes.

38
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:44,713
Guys, listen up. 100 foot cliff.
Four minutes under the water.

39
00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:47,878
And that ladies and gentlemen,
is a new world record.

40
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:50,882
Stop exaggerating John

41
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:52,915
But drink's on me tonight.

42
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:58,897
One bear trap as evidence.-Thank
you.

43
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:01,757
They've been waiting for
you all morning. -Who?

44
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:03,800
Those ladies over there.

45
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:05,737
Why? -No idea.

46
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,817
Hello Ms. Soniya, how are you?

47
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,820
l'm fine. Thank you. She
is my friend, Emily.

48
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:24,754
Hello. -Hi.

49
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:28,953
Her husband is missing.
She needs your help.

50
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:30,860
Why don't you take
her to the police?

51
00:09:30,864 --> 00:09:34,800
She went there. lt's been a
week. He is still missing.

52
00:09:35,902 --> 00:09:37,836
Jai, if not for you. .

53
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:38,997
. .today my child wouldn't
have been alive.

54
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:42,798
ln your case, you were lucky
as you had a photograph.

55
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:45,777
She has a photograph too. That's
why l've brought her here.

56
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,906
Please.

57
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:53,953
Okay, l'll try.

58
00:09:54,787 --> 00:09:56,880
When was this photograph taken?
-Just at that time.

59
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,721
A minute after clicking the
photograph, Emily went to the bathroom.

60
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:03,728
When she returned,
he wasn't there.

61
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:10,767
l'll need some luck, because after
a minute my life will be in danger.

62
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:47,805
Oh, it's really good

63
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:50,876
l'm just going to
he ladies' room.

64
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,879
Hurry back. We have to get back
to the cabin before dark.

65
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:55,778
Okay.

66
00:10:55,815 --> 00:10:57,806
l'll wait here by the car.

67
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:27,903
He fell in the ravine.
Sampson Trail.

68
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:32,945
Near Mile marker. 0.4.

69
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:40,892
He is alive, but injured.

70
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:43,795
He is alive.

71
00:11:44,897 --> 00:11:46,762
Thank you so much. -Thanks, bye.

72
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,858
Take good care of your
husband. Okay.

73
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:09,914
Jai, l've been trying
to call you !

74
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:12,757
There's been an accident.

75
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:46,792
Dad. Dad. -Jai, On the
boat. On the boat.

76
00:12:47,794 --> 00:12:52,959
l saw. .

77
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:05,930
How are you, Savitri?

78
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,848
How are you?

79
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:20,908
As per Jatin's wish, l'm going
to read out his will.

80
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:23,788
There are 12 pages
of legal terms.

81
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:25,814
But the gist is this.

82
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:31,855
'l'm leaving everything
for Savitri.'

83
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:50,749
Savitri, you have to
sign some papers.

84
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,910
l don't believe this. How can
a father do this to his son?

85
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:56,947
As it is, l never
wanted his money.

86
00:14:57,824 --> 00:14:59,018
l know. But it feels bad.

87
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,852
When one doesn't leave anything
for his only son.

88
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:04,727
Does it matter? lt's all
right. lt's okay.

89
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:11,727
All right. As it is, what do l
care when you're with me? -Thank you.

90
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,945
l felt bad about what
happened yesterday.

91
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,884
What is there to feel
bad, Mother?

92
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:36,853
You know what l think
about dad's business.

93
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:38,888
Don't be so angry with your dad.

94
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:41,892
l'm not angry, Ma. l'm just sad.

95
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:44,903
Dad never understood
my point of view.

96
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:48,735
That's not it, Jai. Jatin
was going to change.

97
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:52,774
Jatin was going to transfer
all his wealth. .

98
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:55,814
. .in your organisation's name.

99
00:15:58,751 --> 00:15:59,775
ln the name of my organisation?

100
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:05,883
He knew that this was the
only way to win you back.

101
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:09,760
Maybe this is what he wanted
to tell me that day.

102
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,828
That day in the morning,dad
came to meet me.

103
00:16:18,804 --> 00:16:19,828
'Good morning, Dad.'

104
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:21,863
'Are you sure you won't
come with us?'

105
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:23,934
'You know my answer.'

106
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:25,807
'Today is a special day, Son.'

107
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:26,834
'What's so special, Dad?'

108
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,847
'Your oil company's
annual party.'

109
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:29,870
'Announcement of profits.'

110
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,884
The environment's loss and
your profit. That's all.'

111
00:16:32,752 --> 00:16:34,720
'l know you're not happy
with my business.'

112
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:36,878
'But today l'm going
to do something. .

113
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,018
. .which will make you
proud of your dad.'

114
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,886
'Good. Good, Dad. l
am happy for you.'

115
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:43,886
l was not ready to
listen to him.

116
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:46,865
Son, please. -Bye, Dad.'

117
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:21,833
lt's okay, Jai.

118
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,032
'Help me, Son.'

119
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,754
Same dream again? -No.

120
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,827
Now we will have to deal
with another dream.

121
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:56,730
l love you.

122
00:17:57,803 --> 00:17:59,828
Will you marry me?

123
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:08,871
l don't know how this question
popped in my mind?

124
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:11,848
l know it's been only a year
since we've known each other.

125
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:14,919
But l feel l've found
my life partner.

126
00:18:18,924 --> 00:18:22,792
l don't want to lose you
the way l lost dad.

127
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:24,829
Will you be Mrs. Jai Puri?

128
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:25,922
Yes.

129
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,950
Great smile.

130
00:18:56,829 --> 00:18:57,921
Yes.

131
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:00,823
He wanted us to remember
him this way.

132
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:03,834
A drink in the name of life.

133
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:06,834
Jai, someone's here to meet you.

134
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:21,850
Yes?

135
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:25,789
Hi. l'm Habibullah Pasha.

136
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:26,858
Also known as Happi.

137
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:29,759
and not a Y.

138
00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:34,798
Yes. -How can l help you?

139
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,926
l forgot. l'm Detective
Habibullah Pasha.

140
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:39,862
Also known as Happi.

141
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:41,839
With an l.

142
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:47,810
Shall we sit?

143
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:10,759
lt hurts after a while.

144
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:15,741
Your father was a nice man.

145
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,832
He helped me a lot
when l came here.

146
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:20,878
He gave me money,
a place to stay.

147
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:23,848
Everything.

148
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:27,742
l live in Toronto.

149
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,788
l've come here unofficially,
straight from the airport.

150
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,826
The case doesn't look
that straight.

151
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,724
Your father was a good swimmer.

152
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,957
All his life he travelled
in boats.

153
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,801
So how did he drown so easily?

154
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,837
He didn't drown. He suffered
a heart attack.

155
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:47,769
Did he have any enemies?

156
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,774
Many people were upset with him.

157
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:51,807
l was one of them.

158
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:53,709
So did you do this?

159
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:55,970
What?

160
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,941
Now listen, detective
Happi with an l.

161
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:04,779
Leave with your guns and
weapons. Okay, goodbye.

162
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,950
Look, l want to ask you
something before leaving.

163
00:21:08,794 --> 00:21:11,922
Who benefited from his death?
Think about this.

164
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,869
l have a theory. Will
you listen to it?

165
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:20,031
No?

166
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:42,761
Hi baby face.

167
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:46,956
Happi, how are you? -Very
fine. Thank you.

168
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,903
Let's go.

169
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:56,739
Sir, could you please
walk me through it?

170
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:58,767
l was standing there
on the boat.

171
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:01,836
And l heard a sound.
Sunder shouted out.

172
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,885
Well, l gave him his drink.
And he sat there.

173
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:09,911
And suddenly he slipped. -Why
did Mr. Puri sit on the railing?

174
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:14,715
That was his favourite spot.
He always sat there

175
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,795
Who was standing closest to
Mr. Puri when he fell?

176
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:24,826
What conversations did you have
with Mr. Puri on the yatch that day?

177
00:22:24,904 --> 00:22:28,863
Just casual. You know we've been
friends for a very long time.

178
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:30,967
Was Jatin a good swimmer?

179
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:32,836
He was a very, very
good swimmer.

180
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:34,869
Where were you when
he fell overboard?

181
00:22:35,848 --> 00:22:38,817
l had to go and see to the food.

182
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:47,883
Hi. -Hi.

183
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:49,952
Good morning. -Good morning.

184
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:51,954
Hi -Good morning.

185
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:53,889
lt's a great day today.

186
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:55,833
Let's go.

187
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:13,784
Hello. -This is Happi
with an 'l'.

188
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,911
l thought we have spoken,
Detective.

189
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:20,790
Last night l checked your
father's case file.

190
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:22,884
l told you it was an accident.

191
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:32,904
Do you know my friend Andy
wanted to conduct his post-mortem?

192
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,740
We did not have legal rights.
We could only request.

193
00:23:37,776 --> 00:23:38,800
And?

194
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:40,778
Someone forbid her from
conducting the post-mortem.

195
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,904
Who? -Your mother.

196
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:53,915
You think l've murdered
your dad.

197
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:55,961
No, Mother. l just want
to know your reason. .

198
00:23:56,762 --> 00:23:58,024
. .for refusing the post-mortem.

199
00:23:58,797 --> 00:24:03,825
The reason is that l didn't want
your dad's body to be dissected.

200
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:09,806
As a Hindu, how could l have
given permission for this autopsy?

201
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,001
Ma, this is bullshit.

202
00:24:11,744 --> 00:24:14,736
Can't you forget these religious
things to get to the truth?

203
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:16,747
What truth are you
talking about?

204
00:24:16,782 --> 00:24:17,840
We all were there. Your dad's
four well-wishers.

205
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,784
We saw him slip into the water.

206
00:24:21,954 --> 00:24:23,854
We saw him getting
a heart attack.

207
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:26,891
He died in my arms.

208
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:30,952
l am sorry mother.
But what do l do?

209
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:33,823
l met that man called
Habibullah Pasha.

210
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,797
What did you say is his name?

211
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:38,029
He calls himself Happi.
-Happi with an l.

212
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:39,961
How do you know?

213
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:43,833
We'd helped him when
he had shifted here.

214
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:44,931
He told me.

215
00:24:44,977 --> 00:24:46,808
He must have also
told you that. .

216
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:48,970
. .he was dismissed from
the police force.

217
00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:52,740
Because he suffered from
paranoid delusion and OCD.

218
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:54,910
To escape ignominy, he
ran away to Toronto.

219
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,751
No?

220
00:24:58,757 --> 00:25:01,817
You can't trust him,
Son. He is insane.

221
00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:12,862
Thank you very much.

222
00:25:12,905 --> 00:25:14,896
ctually, he is quite harmless.
l've known him for a long time.

223
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,806
l would appreciate if he stays
away from me and my family.

224
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,002
lf you need anything else,
just give me a call.

225
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:21,871
Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

226
00:25:25,918 --> 00:25:28,887
Hang on. Hang on. Please.
Listen to me.

227
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:30,786
Listen, l've told the
police everything.

228
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:32,916
lf you don't want to get
arrested, then just get out of here.

229
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:34,856
But we have to find your
father's killer?

230
00:25:34,893 --> 00:25:35,917
My father was not murdered.

231
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:40,762
He was. To prove this,
l need your help.

232
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:43,801
l'm really tense. And l don't
want to talk to a crazy fellow.

233
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:44,927
Just go.

234
00:25:44,937 --> 00:25:46,871
Hang on. Hang on.

235
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:49,770
Hang on. Hang on.
Please. Hang on.

236
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:52,868
Assume this just for a second.

237
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:55,938
Jatin was murdered.

238
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:00,942
lf he had been alive, he would
have told you that l'm not insane.

239
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,015
But he is no more.

240
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:06,888
lt's so sad.

241
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:09,920
For me and for you too.

242
00:26:09,962 --> 00:26:11,862
Listen to me, and go
back to Toronto.

243
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,891
l was not dismissed from
the police force.

244
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:19,837
l myself left the service.

245
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:25,809
You can think whatever you want.

246
00:26:26,745 --> 00:26:27,905
But l'll surely catch
the murderer.

247
00:28:10,782 --> 00:28:12,010
'On the boat l saw. .'

248
00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:15,913
'What truth are you
talking about?'

249
00:28:17,923 --> 00:28:20,824
'Jatin was murdered.'

250
00:28:23,795 --> 00:28:25,854
Good that mom clicked this
snap before the accident.'

251
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:03,833
Show me the truth, Dad.

252
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:06,897
'Jatin, enough. You've
had enough to drink.'

253
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:10,929
Savitri, from tomorrow our
new journey will begin.'

254
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,930
'ln the name of that journey. .'

255
00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:16,774
'Cheers. -Cheers.'

256
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:18,742
'Cheers.'

257
00:30:18,844 --> 00:30:20,744
'Cheers, Uncle.'

258
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:24,748
'With this champagne, l
cleanse all my sins.'

259
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:30,877
'Sunder, another glass, if you
please. -Sure. l'll get it.'

260
00:30:32,824 --> 00:30:34,917
'l'm serving lunch.'

261
00:30:35,827 --> 00:30:37,886
'l'll help you with
that, Aunt. -Okay.'

262
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:43,858
As my friend and my lawyer, you
have always supported me.'

263
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,932
'And l'm sorry about what
is going to happen.'

264
00:30:56,882 --> 00:31:03,879
'What are you saying, Uncle?
l'm indebted to you.'

265
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:07,849
'Thanks. This is what
l wanted to hear.'

266
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:17,733
'Sunder, my glass please.
-There you go.'

267
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:18,928
'Thank you.'

268
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,778
'Do you mind?'

269
00:31:26,812 --> 00:31:28,780
'When has my opinion ever
mattered to you. .'

270
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:31,806
. .that today you're playing
this charade?'

271
00:31:31,983 --> 00:31:35,919
'Come on, Sunder. Money
is not everything.'

272
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:50,767
'Help, help.'

273
00:32:34,813 --> 00:32:36,781
Oh Sheila.

274
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:40,747
How is he?

275
00:32:40,785 --> 00:32:42,946
The doctor said that never
before has he seen such a case.

276
00:32:44,856 --> 00:32:46,915
He had to be given a
blood transfusion.

277
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,901
Are you hiding something
from me?

278
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:04,732
Jai used to get these fits
when he was a kid.

279
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:06,774
What fits?

280
00:33:06,912 --> 00:33:11,747
He'd become almost lifeless,
with his eyes staring.

281
00:33:12,817 --> 00:33:15,911
He would regain consciousness,
and know somebody's secret.

282
00:33:16,922 --> 00:33:19,857
As if he had peeped
into their past.

283
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:35,865
Hey, champ. -Hi.

284
00:33:35,941 --> 00:33:37,806
How are you doing? -Okay.

285
00:33:37,943 --> 00:33:40,844
Sheila, you rest.
l'll stay here.

286
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:43,939
He is going to be discharged.
All his reports are normal.

287
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:47,808
Wonderful. -l'll go and get
the discharge papers.

288
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,751
Sit.

289
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:55,950
Tell me. What's the matter?

290
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,924
l know you very well. Something
is surely the matter.

291
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:08,839
l think dad was murdered.

292
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:11,935
What?

293
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:14,972
Dude, l think because of this
emotional breakdown. .

294
00:34:15,747 --> 00:34:16,907
No, it's not an emotional
breakdown.

295
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:19,876
So how could you think of
something so senseless?

296
00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:23,877
l have a secret.

297
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:32,786
Through the photograph, l went
there. On the same boat.

298
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:40,830
At that same time. l saw
what happened there.

299
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:43,841
That railing broke. . -Hang on.

300
00:34:43,942 --> 00:34:47,742
You can say this to a foolish
man. Not to your friend.

301
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:48,938
That's why l didn't tell Sheila.

302
00:34:49,781 --> 00:34:51,942
Do you even know how
weird this sounds?

303
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,943
Your dad's death was
an accident. Fact.

304
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:58,913
You can't cope with it. Fact.

305
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:04,828
You can see the past with the
help of 8x 10 photograph?

306
00:35:05,764 --> 00:35:06,788
lnsanity.

307
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:08,765
Am l interrupting something?

308
00:35:09,868 --> 00:35:11,859
Nothing, Sheila.

309
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,768
l don't even know why l
am this idiot's friend.

310
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:16,931
He has gone mad.

311
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:44,799
'Uncle Sunder was
closest to dad.'

312
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:48,931
'He saw him slipping
into the water.'

313
00:35:49,808 --> 00:35:52,777
'Why didn't he mention
the broken railing?'

314
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:55,879
And if the railing was broken. .

315
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:58,780
. .Who repaired it?'

316
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:12,790
Why did you run away?

317
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:14,884
Leave me.

318
00:37:15,794 --> 00:37:16,761
Why have you come here?

319
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:19,855
l called you so many times.But
your cell is switched off.

320
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:21,796
There is a reason.

321
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:24,894
That police officer
is following me.

322
00:37:24,936 --> 00:37:27,837
Why? -He suspects me.

323
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,897
Have you've murdered dad?

324
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:32,743
You're asking me this?

325
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:38,909
Oh, God.

326
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,816
l'll find out the truth.

327
00:37:57,035 --> 00:37:59,799
Can we talk?

328
00:38:06,945 --> 00:38:09,004
What's your theory?

329
00:38:09,948 --> 00:38:11,848
What's your theory?

330
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,818
Massive myocardial infarction
resulting due to hypothermia.

331
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:19,790
Heart attack.

332
00:38:19,824 --> 00:38:22,793
He fell into the cold water.
That's why his heart stopped.

333
00:38:22,894 --> 00:38:25,829
We all know that. how
is it your theory?

334
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:29,795
Do you know what are
beta-blockers?

335
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:36,773
l consume these small pills
for my blood pressure.

336
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:39,810
Due to stress, l get mad.
So l have to take them.

337
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:42,836
Happi's pills.

338
00:38:42,981 --> 00:38:47,748
lt slows down the heartbeat. And
the blood pressure remains normal.

339
00:38:49,754 --> 00:38:51,722
l don't understand.

340
00:38:51,756 --> 00:38:53,747
All the people on the
boat knew that. .

341
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,918
. .Jatin had suffered two
heart attacks, right?

342
00:38:57,862 --> 00:38:59,887
Somebody gave him extra
beta-blocker.

343
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:01,796
And then pushed him
into cold water.

344
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:04,800
That's why he suffered
a heart attack.

345
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:07,838
Neither did my dad slip, nor
did anybody push him.

346
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:10,806
How can you be so sure?

347
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:15,778
lf l told you, you
won't believe me.

348
00:39:17,782 --> 00:39:21,741
My dad always sat on the
railing of the boat.

349
00:39:21,886 --> 00:39:24,753
Keeping his feet on the cooler.
Putting his weight on the railing.

350
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:27,790
Somebody cut the rod
before his arrival.

351
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,893
He sat there. He put the weight
of his body on it.

352
00:39:29,928 --> 00:39:31,919
That railing broke. And he
slipped into the water.

353
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:34,959
After that, the railing
was repaired.

354
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,768
So that nobody gets suspicious.
-Nice theory.

355
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:40,795
But who did it and why?

356
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,877
'Leave me.'

357
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:49,779
Uncle Sunder.

358
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:53,842
Oh. -Why were you following
Uncle Sunder?

359
00:39:53,952 --> 00:39:55,852
Didn't l tell you?

360
00:39:55,887 --> 00:39:57,752
lf you had told me then
would l have asked you?

361
00:39:57,822 --> 00:39:59,722
He booked a ticket to lndia.

362
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:01,884
Can't you stop him? -No proof.

363
00:40:02,961 --> 00:40:06,863
We need evidence to make
our theories work.

364
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:12,728
'Jatin, enough. You've
had enough.'

365
00:41:12,797 --> 00:41:16,733
'Savitri, in the name of
a new journey. Cheers.'

366
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:19,827
'Sunder, another glass, if you
please. -Sure. l'll get it.'

367
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:20,929
'l'm serving lunch.'

368
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:22,940
'l'll help you with that, Aunt.'

369
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:26,869
'No hard feelings, okay.'

370
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:32,907
'What are you saying, Uncle?
l'm indebted to you.'

371
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:37,720
'That is what l wanted to hear.'

372
00:41:39,991 --> 00:41:41,959
'Sunder, my glass please.
-There you go.'

373
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,920
Thank you, Sunder.'

374
00:42:28,806 --> 00:42:32,902
Uncle Sunder murdered dad.

375
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:35,844
Uncle Sunder. .

376
00:42:46,824 --> 00:42:47,916
Hi, Sweetie.

377
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:50,894
Forget all that. Now that you're
awake, tell me clearly.

378
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:52,862
What the hell is going on?

379
00:42:53,798 --> 00:42:54,856
You won't believe me.

380
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:58,892
Let's see. You accuse people
of murdering your dad. .

381
00:42:58,936 --> 00:43:00,927
. .when you know it
was an accident.

382
00:43:01,038 --> 00:43:03,734
Every alternate day, you're
admitted to the hospital.

383
00:43:03,774 --> 00:43:05,765
And your state is such that even
the doctors are shocked.

384
00:43:05,943 --> 00:43:09,936
l'm standing in front of you.
l'll believe anything you say.

385
00:43:10,781 --> 00:43:12,840
Even that Dracula comes
and sucks your blood.

386
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,884
l'll tell you everything
in the car.

387
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:26,987
So through a photograph you have
found that your dad was murdered.

388
00:43:27,765 --> 00:43:28,789
Exactly.

389
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:31,801
l saw uncle Sunder mixing the
pills in the champagne.

390
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:34,802
You know how crazy it
sounds, don't you?

391
00:43:35,973 --> 00:43:37,838
l know.

392
00:43:38,843 --> 00:43:40,811
That's why l'll have
to do something.

393
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:42,846
lf uncle Sunder has
murdered your dad. .

394
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,780
. .then we should inform
the police.

395
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:46,749
Why have we come here?

396
00:43:48,853 --> 00:43:50,718
Nobody will believe us.

397
00:43:50,788 --> 00:43:52,881
l want to threaten him and make
him spill out the truth.

398
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:55,885
Bad idea.

399
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:11,901
You stay here.

400
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,811
Uncle.

401
00:44:59,757 --> 00:45:00,883
Uncle.

402
00:45:05,863 --> 00:45:07,797
Uncle.

403
00:45:10,901 --> 00:45:12,892
Bad idea.

404
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,938
Okay.

405
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:22,779
Listen. l'll search upstairs.
You search downstairs.

406
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,747
Search for what? -The proof.

407
00:45:28,853 --> 00:45:31,947
ln movies, normally a dead body
is found in such a situation.

408
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:53,739
One, two, three.

409
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:27,841
Jai.

410
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,919
You should take a closer
look at this note.

411
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:49,890
Hi. -Hi, Happi.

412
00:46:50,801 --> 00:46:53,770
Can l have a quick word
with him? -Sure.

413
00:46:53,938 --> 00:46:56,771
Thanks.

414
00:46:57,942 --> 00:46:59,876
Hi, Jai.

415
00:46:59,944 --> 00:47:03,744
You must be Sheila.
Happi with an 'l'.

416
00:47:07,852 --> 00:47:09,752
So this was your proof?

417
00:47:09,787 --> 00:47:11,755
Your theory was right.

418
00:47:12,022 --> 00:47:14,889
Uncle Sunder mixed the
pills in dad's drink.

419
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:17,918
How do you know?

420
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:23,833
What about the suicide note?

421
00:47:23,868 --> 00:47:25,802
Are you fooled by the suicide?

422
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,771
At the moment, all doors are
closed. -l don't believe

423
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:30,873
There is somebody else.

424
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:35,776
Sheila, l suggest don't let
him do anything foolish.

425
00:47:36,781 --> 00:47:38,806
l will try but he won't listen.

426
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:31,867
That vehicle is tailing us.

427
00:48:32,903 --> 00:48:33,927
Which one?

428
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:35,939
l'm observing it since
the last 10 minutes.

429
00:51:16,834 --> 00:51:17,926
Are you okay? -Don't touch me.

430
00:51:18,035 --> 00:51:21,869
l'm sorry. -Your obsession
will kill both of us.

431
00:51:21,939 --> 00:51:24,840
This incident proves that
there is somebody. .

432
00:51:24,942 --> 00:51:26,842
. .who doesn't want me
to know the truth.

433
00:51:26,877 --> 00:51:29,744
What price will you pay
to know this truth?

434
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,814
Your life, or maybe mine.

435
00:51:31,882 --> 00:51:33,850
l promise you. Nothing
will happen to you.

436
00:51:33,951 --> 00:51:35,885
Why don't you forget this
photograph nonsense. .

437
00:51:35,919 --> 00:51:37,819
. .and let the police
do their work?

438
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,915
lf this is nonsense, then how
did l know what happened in the boat?

439
00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:43,918
There is no evidence, Jai.
No evidence, no proof.

440
00:51:43,961 --> 00:51:46,930
Just your theories. And, maybe
this is your delusion.

441
00:51:46,964 --> 00:51:47,931
What do you think?
l've gone mad?

442
00:51:47,998 --> 00:51:48,930
l don't know. Okay.

443
00:51:48,966 --> 00:51:51,764
l just know that along with
you l am going mad too.

444
00:51:51,802 --> 00:51:52,928
Why are you so angry?

445
00:51:54,972 --> 00:51:57,805
Because l know that you'll
never listen to me.

446
00:51:58,776 --> 00:52:00,744
And you'll again visit that
ill-fated photograph. .

447
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:02,879
. .or wherever it is that you go.

448
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,914
l'm fed up, Jai.

449
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:16,725
Okay. l won't do it again.

450
00:52:17,795 --> 00:52:19,763
Really?

451
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:56,731
My heart has found solace.

452
00:52:56,767 --> 00:53:04,936
My heart is happy.

453
00:53:05,776 --> 00:53:06,902
What do l tell you?

454
00:53:06,944 --> 00:53:13,873
Now this journey
has become easy.

455
00:53:13,951 --> 00:53:18,888
With you as my life partner.

456
00:53:18,922 --> 00:53:29,799
My heart has found solace.

457
00:53:30,768 --> 00:53:39,801
My heart is happy.

458
00:53:39,843 --> 00:53:43,745
What do l tell you?

459
00:53:55,926 --> 00:54:01,728
There is no pity, beloved.

460
00:54:01,899 --> 00:54:07,735
You're near me.

461
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:12,902
There is no pain, no sorrow.

462
00:54:12,943 --> 00:54:18,904
When your love is with me,
everything is fine.

463
00:54:19,817 --> 00:54:24,880
Somewhat like this.

464
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:29,850
Your company is like
a prayer answered.

465
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:35,921
This moment and this
weather is ours.

466
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,735
Come and lose yourself
in my love.

467
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:41,829
My heart has found solace.

468
00:54:41,905 --> 00:54:46,740
Somewhat like this.

469
00:54:46,944 --> 00:54:52,780
My heart has found solace.

470
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:59,754
Somewhat like this.

471
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,849
My heart is happy.

472
00:55:01,892 --> 00:55:04,918
What do l tell you?

473
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:50,839
l really think. .

474
00:55:50,874 --> 00:55:52,842
l really am sorry about
what's happened.

475
00:55:53,744 --> 00:55:54,938
Am l disturbing you?

476
00:55:55,979 --> 00:55:57,913
Jai, its not what you think.

477
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:00,916
lt's disgusting, Mother.-Please.
Please let me explain.

478
00:56:01,018 --> 00:56:01,916
What is there to understand,
Mother?

479
00:56:01,952 --> 00:56:04,819
Everything can be clearly
seen. -Hang on.

480
00:56:05,789 --> 00:56:07,916
Before uttering any nonsense,
listen to me.

481
00:56:10,794 --> 00:56:13,820
Yes. l love your mother.
l've always loved her.

482
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:17,790
But she chose Jatin. And
l had to accept this.

483
00:56:17,901 --> 00:56:19,994
Now when dad is dead,
you both. . -Quiet.

484
00:56:21,805 --> 00:56:22,931
How dare you, Jai.

485
00:56:22,973 --> 00:56:26,773
l think you both murdered dad.
-Again the same nonsense.

486
00:56:27,811 --> 00:56:29,904
This photograph business
is driving you insane.

487
00:56:29,947 --> 00:56:30,936
Sheila told you?

488
00:56:31,782 --> 00:56:32,976
You should consult a doctor.

489
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,741
Fantastic. Now he also
knows about it.

490
00:56:35,786 --> 00:56:37,720
That's not the case. You're
very confused.

491
00:56:37,754 --> 00:56:39,016
Maybe you all are
in this together.

492
00:56:39,856 --> 00:56:41,790
But l'll surely know the truth.

493
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,796
And yes. .l'd brought my
luggage to live here.

494
00:56:48,865 --> 00:56:50,924
But l guess, it's overcrowded.

495
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:52,995
Please, Jai.

496
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:08,908
l had some urgent work. That's
why l called you.

497
00:57:13,757 --> 00:57:15,816
Did you murder dad?

498
00:57:21,832 --> 00:57:22,924
You're drunk.

499
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:25,867
Forget that. Did you do it?

500
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,761
l've asked everyone.
Only you were left.

501
00:57:28,872 --> 00:57:29,930
l hope you understand.

502
00:57:30,741 --> 00:57:31,730
Come on, Jai.

503
00:57:31,808 --> 00:57:33,901
Maybe you had arguments with
dad regarding business.

504
00:57:35,045 --> 00:57:37,775
Maybe you both had a fight
and you got angry.

505
00:57:37,881 --> 00:57:39,849
He was like a father
figure to me.

506
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:41,907
More than you, he considered
me his son.

507
00:57:42,953 --> 00:57:44,853
l don't understand what to do.

508
00:57:44,888 --> 00:57:48,016
There are so many questions.
But no answers.

509
00:57:48,859 --> 00:57:51,851
l can't trust anybody. And
nobody can believe me.

510
00:57:52,896 --> 00:57:54,796
Everybody is saying
l have gone mad.

511
00:57:54,831 --> 00:57:56,025
What do you think?
Have l gone mad?

512
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,794
Nonsense. Listen to me.
Stop following ghosts.

513
00:58:01,905 --> 00:58:03,896
Chill.

514
00:58:14,918 --> 00:58:20,823
Jai. Shit.

515
00:58:37,908 --> 00:58:41,002
Today is my happy birthday.
Happy with a 'Y'.

516
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,871
Happy birthday.

517
00:58:45,916 --> 00:58:47,781
Thank you.

518
00:58:48,919 --> 00:58:50,887
l called up EPS many times.

519
00:58:50,954 --> 00:58:52,819
They said you haven't come
to work since a week.

520
00:58:52,889 --> 00:58:54,857
l needed some time off.

521
00:58:55,926 --> 00:58:57,894
Who will know this
better than me?

522
00:58:58,795 --> 00:59:02,822
Your mind is muddled
with thoughts.

523
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:10,736
l want you to meet Bibiji.

524
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:12,730
She is a renowned person.

525
00:59:12,909 --> 00:59:15,776
Maybe she can help you.

526
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,771
You know. .

527
00:59:20,984 --> 00:59:22,952
You too don't believe me.

528
00:59:23,753 --> 00:59:25,948
Going inside the photograph,
seeing the past.

529
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,824
Can't digest it.

530
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:30,918
After all, l'm a police officer.

531
00:59:31,862 --> 00:59:33,762
l too had many problems.

532
00:59:33,964 --> 00:59:36,956
But Bibiji's miracle cured me.

533
00:59:46,877 --> 00:59:49,846
What? What?

534
01:00:58,815 --> 01:01:02,751
ls Bibiji there?

535
01:01:07,857 --> 01:01:10,724
This photo depicts death.

536
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,853
Can you tell me what this is?

537
01:01:13,797 --> 01:01:16,789
Have l gone mad, or
am l seeing things?

538
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:21,794
The life of a man, is like a
journey through pictures.

539
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:24,864
Many pictures.

540
01:01:24,941 --> 01:01:26,909
Like these tarot cards.

541
01:01:27,844 --> 01:01:30,870
Every picture captures a moment.

542
01:01:31,815 --> 01:01:33,942
Our ancestors would draw
pictures on walls. .

543
01:01:33,984 --> 01:01:35,781
. .and we click pictures.

544
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:36,843
The motive is still the same.

545
01:01:36,953 --> 01:01:38,921
Capturing the moment.

546
01:01:38,955 --> 01:01:40,946
What has that got to do with me?

547
01:01:41,925 --> 01:01:44,917
You have the power,
using which. .

548
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:50,892
. .you can use current
photographs as a medium. .

549
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,733
. .to peep into the past.

550
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:55,838
But how did l develop
this power?

551
01:01:55,939 --> 01:01:57,964
There must have been
an incident. .

552
01:01:58,842 --> 01:02:01,970
. .that prompted this power
inside you to awaken.

553
01:02:02,846 --> 01:02:03,904
What incident?

554
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,915
Only your past has an answer
to this question.

555
01:02:11,888 --> 01:02:15,790
Remember, the more time
you spend in the past. .

556
01:02:15,892 --> 01:02:18,952
. .returning to the present will
get difficult. -l know.

557
01:02:19,929 --> 01:02:21,897
lf l stay in the past for
more than one minute. .

558
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:24,832
. .it feels like l barely
escaped death.

559
01:02:27,771 --> 01:02:29,898
Be careful, you can lose
all means of returning.

560
01:02:29,939 --> 01:02:30,906
What do you mean?

561
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:33,807
The pictures are your
way in and out.

562
01:02:33,977 --> 01:02:35,945
lf you are inside the picture. .

563
01:02:36,846 --> 01:02:40,009
. .and someone destroys
it or tears it apart.

564
01:02:40,784 --> 01:02:42,945
Then you will be trapped
in there forever.

565
01:02:44,854 --> 01:02:47,755
There's just one thing
left to do.

566
01:02:47,857 --> 01:02:49,791
Look for the truth.

567
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:53,829
Only this picture will
reveal the truth.

568
01:02:57,834 --> 01:02:59,802
lt ends today. -Damn
that Bibiji.

569
01:02:59,836 --> 01:03:02,805
Thanks man, for being with
me. -Damn that Bibiji.

570
01:03:02,872 --> 01:03:05,773
Uncle Sunder was not alone.
Someone was with him.

571
01:03:05,809 --> 01:03:07,800
We just have to find
that out. -l agree.

572
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:10,778
But what will we do now?
-Just wait and watch.

573
01:03:12,882 --> 01:03:15,749
Where do we have to go?

574
01:03:17,754 --> 01:03:18,914
Damn that Bibiji.

575
01:04:02,932 --> 01:04:04,866
What's wrong?

576
01:04:04,934 --> 01:04:08,893
She's the reason,
why l ran away.

577
01:04:14,811 --> 01:04:17,837
Hi, Sally.

578
01:04:20,984 --> 01:04:22,952
Look who's back from the dead?

579
01:04:23,753 --> 01:04:25,812
Happi, with an 'l'.

580
01:04:25,922 --> 01:04:28,789
You know you are a scoundrel.

581
01:04:28,825 --> 01:04:30,918
You ran away leaving a girl
stranded on the marriage dais.

582
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,952
And that too when l was bearing
all the expenses of the marriage.

583
01:04:34,831 --> 01:04:36,765
After convincing my parents. .

584
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,769
. .that you are not as
cheap as you look.

585
01:04:39,869 --> 01:04:44,772
l gathered my entire family
scattered all around the world.

586
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:47,835
Just so that l can spend
my entire life. .

587
01:04:47,877 --> 01:04:51,836
. .with a lousy police
officer like you.

588
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:55,885
Do you want to say something?

589
01:04:56,753 --> 01:04:59,722
l need a favour.

590
01:05:13,903 --> 01:05:17,737
You know l can lose my
job for this. -Yes.

591
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:23,779
l feel like strangling
you Habibullah pasha.

592
01:05:23,813 --> 01:05:24,871
Yes, Sally.

593
01:05:24,914 --> 01:05:26,973
God, you frustrate me.

594
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:33,846
lf you need me, l'll be at the
nurse's station. -Yes, Sally.

595
01:05:33,923 --> 01:05:35,914
No one will come inside.

596
01:05:40,797 --> 01:05:44,893
She's quite scary. -Not scary,
she's very lovable.

597
01:05:46,803 --> 01:05:50,933
Ready. -Yes, but for what.

598
01:05:51,774 --> 01:05:54,868
Just be ready to transfuse
the blood.

599
01:05:55,979 --> 01:05:58,846
When? -When l come back.

600
01:06:00,817 --> 01:06:02,808
From where?

601
01:06:46,763 --> 01:06:48,754
'Stop it Jatin, you
have had enough.'

602
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:50,732
'ln the name of that journey. .'

603
01:06:50,767 --> 01:06:51,859
'Cheers.'

604
01:06:51,901 --> 01:06:55,769
'Sunder, another glass, if you
please. -Sure. l'll get it.'

605
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:00,740
'And l'm sorry about what
is going to happen.'

606
01:07:09,953 --> 01:07:13,787
'Savitri, l was asked to bring
the papers. -l know.'

607
01:07:13,923 --> 01:07:17,825
'lt would be too late tomorrow.
-lt's his decision.'

608
01:07:17,927 --> 01:07:21,761
'We must stop him. -l am
not a part of this.'

609
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:25,767
'You can't just agree
with him every time.'

610
01:07:26,002 --> 01:07:28,937
'Help. Help.'

611
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,877
Look, the beep is
getting slower.

612
01:07:45,822 --> 01:07:48,757
ls he dead?

613
01:08:12,749 --> 01:08:14,876
Sorry, l called her here.

614
01:08:15,785 --> 01:08:17,776
l thought you are dead.

615
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,788
You would have done the same
if you had seen yourself.

616
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:22,824
Staring with eyes wide open.

617
01:08:24,761 --> 01:08:28,720
Sheila, he's going to do that
again. Please stop him.

618
01:08:28,898 --> 01:08:33,858
Please sweetheart.
-Just one left.

619
01:08:36,806 --> 01:08:39,900
Either l do it here in the
hospital, with everyone.

620
01:08:40,843 --> 01:08:42,936
Or l will do it alone.

621
01:08:44,814 --> 01:08:46,805
But Sweetie, l will do it.

622
01:09:23,886 --> 01:09:25,911
Stop it Jatin, you
have had enough.'

623
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:28,856
'From tomorrow, our new
journey will begin.'

624
01:09:28,891 --> 01:09:30,756
'Cheers. -Cheers.'

625
01:09:30,827 --> 01:09:32,954
Sunder, another glass, if you
please. -Sure. l'll get it.'

626
01:09:33,763 --> 01:09:35,754
'l'm serving lunch.'

627
01:09:35,798 --> 01:09:37,789
'l'll help you with
that, Aunt. -Okay.'

628
01:09:37,834 --> 01:09:40,860
As my friend and lawyer, you
have always supported me.

629
01:10:04,827 --> 01:10:07,728
'And l'm sorry about what
is going to happen.'

630
01:10:08,865 --> 01:10:11,800
'Adit. -Yes, Uncle.'

631
01:10:13,803 --> 01:10:15,862
No hard feelings. -What
are you saying, Uncle?

632
01:10:15,905 --> 01:10:17,930
l was always indebted to you.

633
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:21,935
'Thanks kid. That's what
l was waiting to hear.'

634
01:11:39,989 --> 01:11:42,890
Thank God. -Yes.

635
01:11:54,904 --> 01:11:56,804
We thought. .

636
01:11:59,809 --> 01:12:01,868
You have put me in
trouble again.

637
01:12:01,911 --> 01:12:03,902
Sally, come let's go.

638
01:12:07,783 --> 01:12:09,774
l know everything now.

639
01:12:11,921 --> 01:12:14,822
Hi.

640
01:12:15,992 --> 01:12:17,857
Hi.

641
01:12:25,902 --> 01:12:27,836
l called him.

642
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:31,898
Hey buddy.

643
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:34,943
He'll drop you home.

644
01:12:35,912 --> 01:12:37,880
l have some urgent
work to attend to.

645
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,743
l will have to leave.

646
01:12:39,782 --> 01:12:40,840
Go on.

647
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:44,843
l am not going anywhere, sweety.

648
01:12:44,954 --> 01:12:46,922
l'll be right back.

649
01:12:58,768 --> 01:13:00,759
So you know.

650
01:13:02,805 --> 01:13:04,830
You couldn't stop meddling,
isn't it?

651
01:13:05,908 --> 01:13:07,933
Why did you do it?

652
01:13:11,814 --> 01:13:13,782
Money, Jai.

653
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:15,781
That's the most obvious answer.

654
01:13:15,851 --> 01:13:18,843
Adit, help Jai to the wheel
chair. -Sure, Sheila.

655
01:13:18,988 --> 01:13:20,853
Come on, buddy.

656
01:13:21,757 --> 01:13:23,850
l am going to help you.

657
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:29,955
l'll keep this.

658
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,841
Did we get an answer
to our questions?

659
01:13:52,822 --> 01:13:54,847
Nothing at all.

660
01:13:58,828 --> 01:14:00,887
Did you ever miss
me? -Yes, Sally.

661
01:14:00,997 --> 01:14:03,864
God, you frustrate
me. -Yes, Sally.

662
01:14:04,767 --> 01:14:06,928
You came back when you needed
a favour. -Yes, Sally.

663
01:14:07,937 --> 01:14:10,906
You should think about me
as well. -Yes, Sally.

664
01:14:12,908 --> 01:14:15,809
Let's meet on Saturday.
-Yes, Sally.

665
01:14:48,744 --> 01:14:50,871
Get some rest, l'll
see you later.

666
01:14:53,916 --> 01:14:56,749
Bye sweetheart, see
you later, okay.

667
01:14:57,887 --> 01:15:00,754
Bye, thanks so much.
-My pleasure.

668
01:15:06,929 --> 01:15:08,829
Time for a joyride, buddy.

669
01:15:14,837 --> 01:15:16,896
Don't try to act smart like
you just did in the lift.

670
01:15:18,741 --> 01:15:21,869
Now we'll get into the car,
take care of business.

671
01:15:22,812 --> 01:15:24,905
And you, my friend,
will be a good boy.

672
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,911
What do you think, you won?

673
01:16:08,757 --> 01:16:09,985
The game is not over yet.

674
01:16:38,787 --> 01:16:40,846
Are you fine? -Stop him.

675
01:16:56,872 --> 01:16:59,898
'This picture depicts death.'

676
01:17:00,776 --> 01:17:01,936
'Some incident.'

677
01:17:02,745 --> 01:17:04,838
'What happened, Jai?'

678
01:17:05,915 --> 01:17:07,815
lt's okay. lt's okay.

679
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:11,785
lt's okay. You are not
in danger now. -Hi.

680
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:15,950
He was here the entire night.

681
01:17:15,958 --> 01:17:18,756
Didn't leave you alone
for a moment.

682
01:17:18,961 --> 01:17:21,896
Did you catch Adit? -No,
he disappeared.

683
01:17:22,798 --> 01:17:24,732
Office, house, bank accounts.

684
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,734
He took everything, and left.

685
01:17:26,769 --> 01:17:27,861
Don't worry?

686
01:17:28,804 --> 01:17:29,896
He can't run far.

687
01:17:29,972 --> 01:17:31,940
Are you happy now?

688
01:17:40,983 --> 01:17:45,920
lt's not over, is it? -No.

689
01:18:10,846 --> 01:18:12,746
Hello uncle.

690
01:18:15,818 --> 01:18:17,945
One day, Jatin called
us all for a meeting.

691
01:18:18,754 --> 01:18:21,814
'l called everyone here
for a special reason.'

692
01:18:21,957 --> 01:18:24,824
'l have an announcement
to make.'

693
01:18:25,828 --> 01:18:29,730
'l am going to transfer
everything in the name of EPS.'

694
01:18:29,765 --> 01:18:34,896
Savitri, Sunder, Adit and
l, as the shareholders. .

695
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:38,770
.would incur huge loses because
of this decision.

696
01:18:38,941 --> 01:18:41,739
'That's not fair.-Why, Jatin?'

697
01:18:43,746 --> 01:18:44,940
We were trying to stop him.

698
01:18:45,047 --> 01:18:47,811
As the majority shareholder,
this is my decision to make.

699
01:18:47,983 --> 01:18:50,918
l was hoping that Savitri
would help us.

700
01:18:51,854 --> 01:18:53,788
But Mother wouldn't agree.

701
01:18:54,023 --> 01:18:56,719
She always wanted to
take father's side.

702
01:18:56,892 --> 01:19:00,760
Oh, so that's what you were
telling mother that day?

703
01:19:08,971 --> 01:19:11,838
'Jatin asked me to get
the papers that day.'

704
01:19:11,974 --> 01:19:14,841
But before he could sign them. .

705
01:19:16,745 --> 01:19:19,771
Don't worry, his last wish
is being fulfilled.

706
01:19:20,849 --> 01:19:22,942
Now the company is
in Savitri's name.

707
01:19:23,852 --> 01:19:27,788
And now, she's going to
do what Jatin wanted.

708
01:19:28,891 --> 01:19:31,826
Today, the entire wealth will be
transferred in the name of EPS.

709
01:19:31,927 --> 01:19:34,896
Today? -Sheila, gave all
the papers to Savitri.

710
01:19:48,744 --> 01:19:51,736
And whoever murdered dad for
the Canoil deal, he can. .

711
01:19:57,853 --> 01:19:59,946
Oh my God, mom.

712
01:20:25,748 --> 01:20:26,942
So suddenly, without informing.

713
01:20:28,984 --> 01:20:30,918
Come.

714
01:20:39,895 --> 01:20:42,728
Your timing is perfect.

715
01:20:44,967 --> 01:20:48,801
l was about to sign
on the agreement.

716
01:20:51,807 --> 01:20:52,967
l am very happy today.

717
01:20:53,776 --> 01:20:55,937
At last Jatin's dreams
will be fulfilled.

718
01:21:00,783 --> 01:21:01,943
Come on.

719
01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:46,784
A toast. ln the name of life.

720
01:21:49,932 --> 01:21:52,799
Pick up the phone, mother.

721
01:24:09,805 --> 01:24:14,765
Mom. No, Mom.

722
01:24:15,911 --> 01:24:19,779
Up in the attic. . Father. .

723
01:24:32,995 --> 01:24:34,860
Please stay with mom
in the hospital.

724
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:35,954
l need to take care
of something.

725
01:24:35,964 --> 01:24:37,829
l'll stay with her, don't worry.

726
01:26:56,872 --> 01:26:58,772
Hi baby, what's up?
-Where are you?

727
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,808
Going home, from
the office. Why?

728
01:27:00,809 --> 01:27:02,743
Get out of there, you are
not safe. Go home.

729
01:27:02,811 --> 01:27:04,779
What do you mean? -Sheila,
it's not over.

730
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,804
l have to do something.

731
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:06,939
Jai, when will this end.

732
01:27:06,982 --> 01:27:09,780
Try to understand, l know
everything now. Okay.

733
01:27:09,818 --> 01:27:11,786
l'll see you at home, bye. -Bye.

734
01:27:29,805 --> 01:27:30,897
Please don't tell me.

735
01:27:30,972 --> 01:27:33,964
l hope your useless friend
won't deceive me again.

736
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:36,878
l'll make sure that
doesn't happen.

737
01:27:36,912 --> 01:27:38,937
But please, l need your help.

738
01:27:39,848 --> 01:27:40,974
Please.

739
01:27:42,951 --> 01:27:44,919
This is an adrenaline injection.

740
01:27:44,986 --> 01:27:46,920
You will regain consciousness
instantly.

741
01:27:47,756 --> 01:27:50,748
But remember, you can
even lose your life.

742
01:27:51,893 --> 01:27:53,861
Thank you.

743
01:28:02,971 --> 01:28:05,838
Hello, Happi. -Sally called.

744
01:28:05,941 --> 01:28:08,876
l hope it isn't about those
pictures again. -Yes.

745
01:28:09,744 --> 01:28:10,904
The truth was always right
in front of my eyes. .

746
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:12,742
. .but l could never see it.

747
01:28:12,781 --> 01:28:14,908
Congratulations. Will you
explain me this new theory.

748
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:17,851
Dad wanted to show me that.

749
01:28:17,953 --> 01:28:19,818
On the boat, l saw. .

750
01:28:19,855 --> 01:28:21,948
Dad saw someone else on the
boat other than those four.

751
01:28:22,858 --> 01:28:24,849
But when the entered the
pictures the first time. .

752
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,929
. .l came out without knowing
the entire truth.

753
01:28:29,731 --> 01:28:29,958
Jai, you should stop doing this.

754
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:32,756
lt can be fatal. -This
is the last time.

755
01:28:32,968 --> 01:28:35,732
Partner, that's what you
said the last time.

756
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:37,839
Even Sally thinks
it's too risky.

757
01:28:38,773 --> 01:28:42,709
Happi, listen Don't deceive
Sally again. -l won't.

758
01:28:42,911 --> 01:28:44,845
But please listen to me,
it is very risky.

759
01:28:44,913 --> 01:28:46,881
Bye. -Partner.

760
01:29:17,846 --> 01:29:19,939
'Cheers. -Cheers.'

761
01:29:30,892 --> 01:29:33,793
'l am serving food. -l'll help
you with that, Aunt.'

762
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:38,798
You have greatly helped me in
this.'way in and out of it.'

763
01:30:40,962 --> 01:30:43,931
'The photos are your only
way in and out of

764
01:30:44,966 --> 01:30:49,801
'lf you are inside, and
someone destroys it. .

765
01:30:49,904 --> 01:30:54,841
. .or eradicates it, you'll
be trapped inside forever.

766
01:32:08,817 --> 01:32:10,808
An incident, that provoked. .

767
01:32:10,852 --> 01:32:13,946
. .this power inside
you to awaken.'

768
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,921
'The answer lies in your past.'

769
01:33:09,811 --> 01:33:10,903
'What happened, Jai?'

770
01:33:10,979 --> 01:33:12,947
'What happened?'

771
01:33:13,748 --> 01:33:15,739
'Why are you quiet?'

772
01:33:15,783 --> 01:33:16,909
'Jai'

773
01:33:16,951 --> 01:33:19,784
'Tell me something.'

774
01:33:20,822 --> 01:33:22,813
'What happened, Jai?'

775
01:33:22,857 --> 01:33:24,825
'Where is Jeet?'

776
01:33:24,893 --> 01:33:26,918
'What happened with Jeet?'

777
01:33:28,796 --> 01:33:30,764
'Jai. Jai.'

778
01:34:24,786 --> 01:34:26,947
'There are some treatments. .
-We've tried everything, Doctor.'

779
01:34:26,988 --> 01:34:28,853
'There's an extreme method.'

780
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:31,791
'But normally l don't recommend
it to anyone.'

781
01:34:32,827 --> 01:34:34,818
'Get rid of all of Jeet's
memorabilia.'

782
01:34:34,929 --> 01:34:36,920
'His clothes, his toys.'

783
01:34:36,998 --> 01:34:39,762
'And especially, his
photographs.'

784
01:34:40,902 --> 01:34:43,029
'l don't know how he's
related to it.'

785
01:34:43,838 --> 01:34:45,829
'But keep these photographs
away from him.'

786
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:48,932
'There shouldn't be anything
than can remind him of Jeet.'

787
01:34:49,777 --> 01:34:51,904
'lf possible, you should leave
this city as well.'

788
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:54,744
'We have a vast business
in Canada.'

789
01:34:54,849 --> 01:34:56,817
'Why don't we shift there?'

790
01:35:23,778 --> 01:35:25,746
Hello, Brother.

791
01:35:37,959 --> 01:35:40,792
Same to same.

792
01:35:46,768 --> 01:35:47,928
Switch that off.

793
01:36:11,826 --> 01:36:13,794
l wish Jai could see this.

794
01:36:15,763 --> 01:36:18,789
Thanks to Bibiji, my
work got lot easier.

795
01:36:18,966 --> 01:36:20,900
No knives or gun.

796
01:36:20,968 --> 01:36:25,769
Just set a photograph on
fire. And he's dead.

797
01:36:26,741 --> 01:36:28,800
Are we ready baby? -Absolutely,
darling.

798
01:36:28,843 --> 01:36:30,868
We are completely ready
for the switch.

799
01:36:30,912 --> 01:36:32,880
And we are going around
and around and around

800
01:36:32,947 --> 01:36:36,747
Just imagine, l am Jai Puri.

801
01:36:36,851 --> 01:36:40,878
The sole and sad inheritor of
millions of Canoil company.

802
01:36:41,889 --> 01:36:43,914
God, you are brilliant Jeet.

803
01:36:44,826 --> 01:36:48,956
No Jeet. No Jeet, get into the
habit of calling me Jai. .

804
01:37:03,778 --> 01:37:05,905
After so many years, Brother.

805
01:37:07,849 --> 01:37:10,750
And l thought you died
because of me.

806
01:37:10,985 --> 01:37:12,919
That's what you wanted.

807
01:37:12,954 --> 01:37:15,752
That was an accident.

808
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:19,783
No, l want that life back which
you snatched from me.

809
01:37:19,927 --> 01:37:21,861
You said he's dead.

810
01:37:21,896 --> 01:37:23,796
l checked his breath
a minute ago.

811
01:37:23,798 --> 01:37:24,787
Should have checked properly.

812
01:37:24,832 --> 01:37:26,766
What do you mean, l should
have checked properly.

813
01:37:26,801 --> 01:37:27,859
And you left a loaded gun
by his side. How stupid.

814
01:37:27,902 --> 01:37:29,893
Just shut up. -Shut up.

815
01:37:30,905 --> 01:37:32,770
Why did you do this, Sheila?

816
01:37:32,807 --> 01:37:34,866
Stop this emotional crap, Jai.

817
01:37:35,777 --> 01:37:37,768
l love Jeet, and l always have.

818
01:37:37,845 --> 01:37:39,904
What you and your family
did with him. .

819
01:37:39,947 --> 01:37:42,916
And l loved you. -l
know, sweetheart.

820
01:37:43,818 --> 01:37:45,945
You loved me, protected me.

821
01:37:46,788 --> 01:37:47,846
You wanted to marry me as well.

822
01:37:48,756 --> 01:37:49,780
Well done.

823
01:38:01,969 --> 01:38:03,766
Jeet.

824
01:38:03,838 --> 01:38:04,862
Jeet, be careful.

825
01:38:16,751 --> 01:38:17,911
Hi, Happi. What's up?

826
01:38:18,753 --> 01:38:19,845
Jai isn't picking up his phone.

827
01:38:20,755 --> 01:38:22,780
ls he fine? -Yes, why?

828
01:38:22,924 --> 01:38:23,948
He's sleeping.

829
01:38:24,759 --> 01:38:26,886
No. . He said he'll be entering
the picture again.

830
01:38:27,762 --> 01:38:28,854
Sorry, l didn't understand?

831
01:38:30,798 --> 01:38:34,928
Happi, everything is fine.

832
01:38:37,872 --> 01:38:41,706
No, but Jai said

833
01:38:57,925 --> 01:38:59,825
Oh my God.

834
01:38:59,894 --> 01:39:01,759
l am sorry, Happi.

835
01:39:01,829 --> 01:39:03,854
He said if l tell you anything
he will kill Jai.

836
01:39:03,898 --> 01:39:05,763
Happi, l am Jai.

837
01:39:05,867 --> 01:39:07,767
Don't believe him.
-Happi, l am Jai.

838
01:39:07,835 --> 01:39:09,735
No he's lying, l am Jai.

839
01:39:09,770 --> 01:39:11,761
Happi, he shot me. Look.

840
01:39:11,873 --> 01:39:12,931
No, don't be fooled
by him, Happi.

841
01:39:13,741 --> 01:39:14,969
He's lying. l am Jai
-Help me Happi.

842
01:39:15,743 --> 01:39:17,734
Jai. -Shut up.

843
01:39:18,813 --> 01:39:21,714
Sheila. You tell me. -No.

844
01:39:21,782 --> 01:39:22,942
Yes. Jai.

845
01:39:24,752 --> 01:39:26,720
l am Jai, Happi.

846
01:39:28,823 --> 01:39:32,884
Okay. Put down the gun.
-No Happi, he's lying.

847
01:39:32,927 --> 01:39:34,758
They are both in this together.

848
01:39:34,795 --> 01:39:36,888
Fine, if we are together.

849
01:39:37,832 --> 01:39:39,766
Then why don't we go to the
police and decide this?

850
01:39:39,934 --> 01:39:41,765
Fair enough.

851
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:43,862
He's putting up a charade.

852
01:39:43,905 --> 01:39:45,805
Don't provoke me to shoot you.

853
01:40:01,989 --> 01:40:04,787
Down. Come on.

854
01:40:06,961 --> 01:40:07,928
Hands at your back.

855
01:40:07,962 --> 01:40:09,862
Trust me, you are doing
the wrong thing.

856
01:40:12,833 --> 01:40:17,861
Don't deceive Sally
again. -What?

857
01:40:17,972 --> 01:40:19,940
Don't deceive Sally again.

858
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:26,906
Jai. Sheila. .

859
01:40:46,801 --> 01:40:48,860
Sorry Sally. .

860
01:41:24,905 --> 01:41:27,806
lt's time for you to
go meet dad, Jai.

861
01:41:29,777 --> 01:41:33,838
lf you wanted to take my place
then why wait until now?

862
01:41:35,816 --> 01:41:39,775
Sheila, shall l tell Jai
everything? -Of course.

863
01:41:41,856 --> 01:41:45,758
Part one, l had to associate
Adit in the plan. .

864
01:41:45,793 --> 01:41:47,761
. .because you need finance
for every plan.

865
01:41:47,862 --> 01:41:49,830
Adit, this is Jeet.

866
01:41:50,765 --> 01:41:52,926
He thought we needed
a scapegoat.

867
01:41:53,901 --> 01:41:56,893
Uncle Sunder was a
greedy bastard.

868
01:41:57,805 --> 01:41:59,932
lt didn't take us long
to convince him.

869
01:42:00,808 --> 01:42:02,969
But that day, when he
thought you were me. .

870
01:42:04,779 --> 01:42:05,905
. .everything was about
to be ruined.

871
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:07,777
He had to go.

872
01:42:07,848 --> 01:42:09,941
l enjoyed strangling
him to death.

873
01:42:11,886 --> 01:42:14,946
Part two. -Making you
fall in love with me.

874
01:42:15,890 --> 01:42:16,982
And that was very easy.

875
01:42:22,797 --> 01:42:26,893
Whether you believe it or
not, we both think alike.

876
01:42:31,806 --> 01:42:32,898
Kinky.

877
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:40,941
Part three, l started learning
every thing you did.

878
01:42:41,949 --> 01:42:44,884
The way you eat, the way you
sleep, the way you do everything.

879
01:42:44,985 --> 01:42:47,749
Even the way you breathe.

880
01:42:55,796 --> 01:42:56,922
lt took a lot of effort.

881
01:42:56,964 --> 01:42:59,899
But slowly, Jeet became Jai.

882
01:43:00,835 --> 01:43:03,827
Now there was only one thing
left in the plan.

883
01:43:03,938 --> 01:43:05,872
To replace real Jai.

884
01:43:06,974 --> 01:43:08,942
Everything was going fine.

885
01:43:09,777 --> 01:43:14,805
But one day, suddenly
dad decided. .

886
01:43:14,982 --> 01:43:19,942
.that he'd transfer the entire
wealth, my wealth. .

887
01:43:20,888 --> 01:43:23,823
To your environment company.

888
01:43:26,761 --> 01:43:28,729
We had to change the plan.

889
01:43:28,829 --> 01:43:30,854
Adit stole the blood
pressure tablets.

890
01:43:31,799 --> 01:43:36,759
l went on the boat,
cut the railing.

891
01:43:36,837 --> 01:43:38,862
You know all that.

892
01:43:39,874 --> 01:43:41,865
l hid there and watched
everything.

893
01:43:41,909 --> 01:43:43,706
So that nothing goes wrong now.

894
01:43:43,944 --> 01:43:45,912
Plan came back on track.

895
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:49,848
And, dad died before he could
transfer the company,

896
01:43:50,751 --> 01:43:53,845
And as if that wasn't
enough our mother. .

897
01:43:53,888 --> 01:43:59,793
. .the pious woman decided to
fulfil our father's last wish.

898
01:44:13,841 --> 01:44:17,834
Jai. -No, Mother.

899
01:44:19,947 --> 01:44:22,780
lt's me, Jeet.

900
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:26,852
Tell me Jai, is that fair.

901
01:44:27,988 --> 01:44:30,821
l have been wronged, isn't it?

902
01:44:30,958 --> 01:44:33,825
Sweetie, will you help
me with this?

903
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:37,798
l'll come back.

904
01:45:01,889 --> 01:45:04,790
Goodbye, Brother.

905
01:45:37,892 --> 01:45:41,794
The night, the ambience

906
01:45:41,829 --> 01:45:44,923
The river banks, the
capricious breeze.

907
01:47:00,908 --> 01:47:02,876
No more meeting slyly.

908
01:47:17,758 --> 01:47:18,952
Let's go home now, all right.

909
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:20,920
l'll go get the champagne.

910
01:47:43,817 --> 01:47:45,842
Jeet!

911
01:47:54,762 --> 01:47:55,922
Jeet.

912
01:47:59,967 --> 01:48:02,834
Don't force me to
kill her, Jeet.

913
01:48:03,904 --> 01:48:05,769
Drop your gun.

914
01:48:05,806 --> 01:48:07,831
Damn it Jai, why don't you die?

915
01:48:07,908 --> 01:48:09,876
l know you have been wronged.

916
01:48:09,877 --> 01:48:10,844
Thank you.

917
01:48:10,978 --> 01:48:12,843
You did enough justice
by saying this.

918
01:48:14,782 --> 01:48:16,750
l want my life back.

919
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:18,718
l want my life back.

920
01:48:18,786 --> 01:48:19,980
You snatched it from me.

921
01:48:25,993 --> 01:48:28,826
Brother, give me
a chance please.

922
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:30,819
Please. Listen to me.

923
01:48:30,864 --> 01:48:33,833
Whatever happened in our
childhood, was an accident.

924
01:48:34,968 --> 01:48:38,870
l didn't want to hurt you back
then, nor do l want to today.

925
01:48:44,778 --> 01:48:46,803
Brother, l am on your side.

926
01:48:50,918 --> 01:48:52,943
See, no tricks.

927
01:48:56,890 --> 01:48:58,721
Please.

928
01:49:01,862 --> 01:49:03,853
l have found my brother
after so many years.

929
01:49:05,799 --> 01:49:07,824
l don't want to lose him again.

930
01:49:12,773 --> 01:49:14,934
lt's too late. -lt's not.

931
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:19,811
The truth will always
remain between us.

932
01:49:19,913 --> 01:49:21,904
And there is no evidence,
Brother.

933
01:49:22,749 --> 01:49:24,717
Just me entering
the photographs.

934
01:49:24,818 --> 01:49:26,809
And no one believes in
it, you know that.

935
01:49:29,923 --> 01:49:31,914
We can live together again.

936
01:49:32,759 --> 01:49:33,953
We can be family.

937
01:49:33,994 --> 01:49:35,859
ust think, Brother.

938
01:49:38,765 --> 01:49:39,891
Jeet, what are you doing?

939
01:49:39,967 --> 01:49:41,696
Put the gun down.

940
01:49:41,768 --> 01:49:42,996
Jeet, shoot him. -Please,
listen to me.

941
01:49:44,938 --> 01:49:46,803
Jeet, shoot him.

942
01:49:47,875 --> 01:49:50,002
Brother, can everything
be fine? -Of course.

943
01:49:51,879 --> 01:49:53,847
We can stay as a family.
-Of course.

944
01:49:53,914 --> 01:49:55,814
Family. Jeet, shoot him.

945
01:51:17,798 --> 01:51:18,890
Brother.

946
01:51:31,845 --> 01:51:33,870
This story didn't have
to end like this.

947
01:51:41,955 --> 01:51:44,822
Brother.

948
01:51:49,796 --> 01:51:50,888
Don't do this to me.

949
01:54:41,968 --> 01:54:43,731
Give me the picture.

950
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:44,896
Who got the 8x 10?

951
01:54:44,938 --> 01:54:46,769
l need the picture.

952
01:54:46,807 --> 01:54:47,933
Go get the 8x 10.

953
01:54:47,941 --> 01:54:49,772
Who got the picture?

954
01:54:49,776 --> 01:54:50,868
We got the 8x 10.

955
01:54:50,911 --> 01:54:52,742
l got the picture.

956
01:54:52,813 --> 01:54:53,871
We got the 8x 10.

957
01:54:53,914 --> 01:54:54,972
Give me the picture.

958
01:54:55,749 --> 01:54:56,909
Who got the 8x 10?

959
01:54:56,917 --> 01:54:58,748
l need the picture.

960
01:54:58,785 --> 01:54:59,945
Go get the 8x 10.

961
01:54:59,953 --> 01:55:01,716
Who got the picture?

962
01:55:01,755 --> 01:55:02,881
Go get the 8x 10.

963
01:55:02,889 --> 01:55:04,720
l got the picture.

964
01:55:04,758 --> 01:55:05,918
Go get the 8x 10.

965
01:55:06,893 --> 01:55:08,952
Humans are just puppets
in the hands of life.

966
01:55:08,995 --> 01:55:11,964
Though the picture in
the mind of a mad.

967
01:55:12,866 --> 01:55:15,767
Humans are just puppets
in the hands.

968
01:55:15,769 --> 01:55:17,896
Though the picture in
the mind of a mad.

969
01:55:17,971 --> 01:55:19,905
Like the intoxication
of alcohol.

970
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:21,771
And the heat of the fire.

971
01:55:21,808 --> 01:55:24,743
Like light recedes
in the night.

972
01:55:24,778 --> 01:55:25,904
Like the thoughts
in your mind.

973
01:55:25,946 --> 01:55:27,971
Like the sweating palms.

974
01:55:27,981 --> 01:55:29,949
No one supports
you when you get.

975
01:55:30,784 --> 01:55:33,753
Humans are just puppets
in the hands.

976
01:55:33,787 --> 01:55:36,756
Everything has to
go by the book.

977
01:55:36,790 --> 01:55:38,849
Let's change the rules
of the book.

978
01:55:38,859 --> 01:55:41,885
Or lets change the people that
don't play by the book.

979
01:55:41,928 --> 01:55:44,897
No love, or fear in my heart.

980
01:55:44,898 --> 01:55:47,833
l am living amongst
the dead without.

981
01:55:47,868 --> 01:55:50,803
l am lost, and my soul is
a complete stranger.

982
01:55:51,838 --> 01:55:53,931
Take a look at my
life, through my

983
01:55:53,974 --> 01:55:55,737
Take a ride with him.

984
01:55:55,775 --> 01:55:57,834
Let's go deep inside my life.

985
01:55:57,844 --> 01:55:59,903
Light camera action, reaction
is a mystery.

986
01:55:59,946 --> 01:56:02,938
You're clueless, every path
leads to confusion.

987
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:06,719
Lack of information,
blinded by illusion.

988
01:56:06,753 --> 01:56:08,948
Slow down. Take a
good look around.

989
01:56:08,989 --> 01:56:11,958
Life is a game, and we
are on the playground.

990
01:56:11,958 --> 01:56:13,789
Picture perfect
with precision.

991
01:56:13,827 --> 01:56:14,919
Stay on them until the end.

992
01:56:14,961 --> 01:56:17,896
The only weapon in my
hands is this 8x 10.

993
01:56:18,865 --> 01:56:20,958
Humans are just puppets
in the hands.

994
01:56:20,967 --> 01:56:23,868
Though the picture in the
mind of a mad man.

995
01:56:24,871 --> 01:56:26,964
Humans are just puppets
in the hands.

996
01:56:26,973 --> 01:56:30,807
Though the picture in
the mind of a mad.

997
01:56:36,816 --> 01:56:39,751
Humans are just puppets
in the hands.

998
01:56:39,786 --> 01:56:42,755
Though the picture in
the mind of a mad.

999
01:56:42,856 --> 01:56:44,915
Humans are just puppets
in the hands.

1000
01:56:44,958 --> 01:56:47,984
Though the picture in
the mind of a mad.

1001
01:58:09,909 --> 01:58:12,878
l have a secret.
