1
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:02,439
What will l or you say...

2
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:06,120
about a girl who suddenly
comes into your life...

3
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:08,318
and then leaves you lonely?

4
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:12,517
''lt's another thing that she wasn't
just beautiful, she was brilliant too''

5
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:15,846
There were just four people
she had loved in life

6
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:19,119
''Hariprasad Chaurasia,
Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan...''

7
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:22,721
R.D. Burman... and me

8
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:26,121
''Of the rest of the three,
two are no longer in this world''

9
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:28,757
The third is as old
as her grandfather

10
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:31,596
But l was still jealous of them

11
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:36,836
One thing l must admit.
The five years l spent with her...

12
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:39,926
were the most beautiful years
of my life

13
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:44,838
When a journey like this one ends
suddenly and your companionship ends...

14
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:49,120
''you try to get a hold on your heart,
however unsuccessfully, and...''

15
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:52,121
and ask yourself just one question:

16
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:55,118
Was it all worth it?

17
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:58,839
ls it better to fall in love
and lead a life of loneliness?

18
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,916
Or mustn't one
fall in love at all?

19
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,758
''Don't you have anything longer?
- No, sir''

20
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,918
We rarely find tall people like you.
l can have one made to order

21
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:20,925
''No, give me this one.
- Want to see some T-shirts, shorts?''

22
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,119
''Shorts! lf the pajamas as so short,
how short will the shorts be?''

23
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:26,716
''ln that case, l'll pack the
pajamas and kurta''

24
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,804
''No, not the kurta.
Just the pajama''

25
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,601
''But this is a set, sir.
l can't give you just pajamas''

26
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:34,600
The kurta isn't of any use to me.
l need just the pajamas

27
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:37,846
''But if we give you the pajama,
the kurta won't be of any use to us''

28
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:40,925
Now look. l've bought pajamas before.
- Please try to understand...

29
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,925
''l understand. ln free lndia, you say,
l can't buy a pair of pajamas without...''

30
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:46,721
Please don't be angry.
l'll go and ask my boss

31
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,558
Didn't you find it?

32
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,598
''He wants only the pajamas,
he isn't buying the kurta''

33
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,759
What will we do with the kurta then?
- Don't tell me!

34
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:02,005
He wants only the pajamas?
l'll have a word with the manager

35
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:05,687
''He's asking only for the pajamas
from the set, manager''

36
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:08,362
Only the pajamas ?
- Yes

37
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:13,119
''Sir, call from the store.
- Bet 10 on Lakshman''

38
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,121
''Call from the store, sir.
- What is it!''

39
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:20,117
Bet ten on Lakshman. He'll get out
before he reaches his thirties

40
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:24,521
''Call from the store, sir''

41
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:28,517
''Call from the manager, sir.
- What does the idiot say?''

42
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,958
''What is it? Go on.
- We have a problem, sir''

43
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:39,847
What is it?
- A customer wants only pajamas

44
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:42,926
So give it to him!
- lf we give away only the pajamas...

45
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:47,644
what will we do with the kurta?
- Right. We can't spoil a set

46
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:51,444
''Which ass will wear only a kurta?
- So what are we to do, sir?''

47
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:54,919
''ldiot! Refuse him!
We're not in America, are we?''

48
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:04,516
There are going to be
two more run-outs!

49
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:07,516
Raise the stakes to twenty.
Two more run-outs are inevitable

50
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:10,117
''For such a little thing, you guys...
- l'm only a servant, sir''

51
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:13,115
''Can l buy only the pajamas?
- No, sir''

52
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:15,841
''Not with the kurta, sir.
- But what's the problem?''

53
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,038
''lt's a whole set, sir.
- Forget it...''

54
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,718
Please pack this kurta

55
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:25,915
''l've been listening to you talk.
l can help out, if you wish''

56
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:28,437
l need just the kurta

57
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,558
This is amazing

58
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,958
So please pack this kurta.
- Very well

59
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:40,038
l'll find you a matching pajama

60
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:42,004
''No, l don't want such
a multi-colour pajama''

61
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:44,038
l'm no circus clown.
l want a striped pajama

62
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,561
And l want a kurta.
Not a striped prison uniform!

63
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,598
Now what problem is this?
- Hers actually

64
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:50,922
She wants to impose it on her hubby.
- l don't have any husband

65
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:53,357
Must be her brother then.
- This kurta is meant for my Papa...

66
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,518
and he's not in jail.
- All right

67
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:57,319
''l'll forget about checks,
and you forget about stripes''

68
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:59,398
Let's choose a plain-cut.
l haven't much time

69
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:01,836
Don't forget.
l'm the one who's helping

70
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:03,924
''But the plain-cut
is a nice idea, madam''

71
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,839
''All right, pack a yellow one.
- Yellow?''

72
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:08,123
You don't even like yellow?
- When did l say it's not nice?

73
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:10,318
''Which set do l give you, madam?
- Whichever one you like''

74
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,722
Give me the yellow one.
- End of the problem

75
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:15,122
Pack them separately.
- How much have l to pay?

76
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,119
What? The plain is worth 380
and the checked one...

77
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,921
''Look at the material, madam.
- l liked the other material too''

78
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:23,517
Give me the yellow with checks.
- lt has to do with a little money

79
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:26,116
Not little.
l stand to lose 60 rupees

80
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,519
''For you it means nothing, but for the
poor it means provisions for five days''

81
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,122
''All right. How much will you reduce?
- 435, sir''

82
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:34,920
A measly five-rupee discount?
- l'm not paying a penny more than 400

83
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,322
''We couldn't even buy it at 400...
- 415, That's it''

84
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:40,519
''No more arguments, please.
- All right. Make the bill''

85
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:42,804
The two of us will have to pay
207.50 each

86
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,519
One moment. l'm not falling
for it now

87
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:47,844
Tell me something. What's worth more
in your store. Shirts or trousers?

88
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:50,687
That depends on the material used.
- Generally speaking?

89
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:53,721
The trousers cost more.
- The pajamas are trousers...

90
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:55,918
and the kurta is a shirt.
So this gentleman pays more

91
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:58,118
There is no question
of paying equally!

92
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:01,916
''l have an answer. The pajamas have
buttons, not a zip''

93
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,635
But it has a long string!
- That's enough

94
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,521
''l'll pay 400, you pay 15.
l gift the kurta to your father''

95
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:10,879
Don't try to act too smart.
l don't want any favour from you

96
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:13,840
l'll pay 200 rupees.
- How about 7.50 paise?

97
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:15,958
Forget it. You lost your chance

98
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:21,123
No more fights. l'll give you
the set for 400. You pay 200 each

99
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:22,926
All right

100
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:28,118
The customers we get!

101
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,838
You know what your problem is?
- What?

102
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,958
You're rich and stupid.
- How can you say that?

103
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,123
l could be poor and smart too.
- You couldn't

104
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:38,516
Because l'm poor and smart.
- And what proof of your smartness?

105
00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:41,116
Proof is that l'm not talking to you
for even a minute!

106
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,325
When did l say that?
- See? No wonder you're stupid!

107
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:50,924
Amar Singh Ranawat

108
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:53,925
You belong to a princely state
or a Rajput family?

109
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:56,846
''Well, not quite. But would you
like things to be that way?''

110
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:59,516
''What difference does it make to me?
You'll remain what you are, moneybags''

111
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:02,116
Stop calling me moneybags.
l've told you my name

112
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:05,519
But that doesn't change the truth.
You are what you are

113
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:08,118
What's your name?
- Lekha

114
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:10,518
''Lekha, what?
- Lekha Khurzvekar''

115
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:13,516
Lekha K-h-u-r-z-v-e-k-a-r

116
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:16,521
''Khurjvekar.
- lt's pronounced with a Z, not J''

117
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:18,604
You live in Maharashtra.
Not in Rajasthan

118
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:21,595
J or Z... what difference
does it make?

119
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:24,521
Forget it. Why must you
tax your little brains?

120
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:28,840
''lf you think l'm such a fool,
why are you sitting here with me?''

121
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:33,917
Because you have two things.
A handsome face and a nice body

122
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:39,119
Forget it. Your little brain
has stopped working again!

123
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,444
Laugh! lt was meant to be a joke!

124
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:50,240
''What luck! 3 months of college left,
and we get to meet now''

125
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:54,919
So what's wrong?
- We ought to have met earlier

126
00:07:56,047 --> 00:08:00,120
What for?
- l'd have had someone to fight with

127
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,837
What are you doing on Sunday afternoon?
- Depends

128
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:08,119
How about going go-karting?
Have you ever gone before?

129
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:11,845
''lt's those toy-cars, right?
ln which kids whiz by here and there?''

130
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:14,925
lt isn't so easy.
The one who wins in go-karting...

131
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,118
is sent to the F1 Circuit.
- F1 ?

132
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:23,963
Like you are supposed to play county
Cricket before Test Cricket...

133
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:27,120
that's the step before F1 .
- Amazing

134
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:30,519
Next Sunday is the final race.
Before that is a practice round

135
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:32,998
You must come.
- On one condition

136
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:35,926
What?
- lf you promise to take me to...

137
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:38,925
''Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia's concert.
- Hari, who?''

138
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,959
''He's lndia's No 1 flautist, Amar!
l'm crazy about him!''

139
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:47,119
Know what? He's going to be
accompanied by Zakir Husain

140
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,598
''Not this tyranny on me, please!''

141
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:53,122
Looks like our tastes are different

142
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:55,918
''Had you yourself been performing,
l'd surely have attended''

143
00:08:56,127 --> 00:09:00,837
Even if l didn't understand it.
But l'm myself into go-karting

144
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,118
And you're coming

145
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:11,919
''You at least like R.D. Burman, l hope?
- Oh yes, absolutely''

146
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:00,958
Moneybags!
Leave this game for the kids.

147
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:04,119
That little car cannot
take your huge body

148
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:07,121
Go ahead and laugh.
When you see the finals...

149
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:10,120
''your jaw will drop.
- You're such a kid, Amar!''

150
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:15,118
''And you're very smart, eh?
Let's go''

151
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,915
''That's enough, Amar.
Stop being childish''

152
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:21,525
''Car-racing can be a hobby, a passion.
lt can't be career''

153
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:25,119
You know much money Formula One
drivers make?

154
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,958
Michael Schumaker is the
world's richest sportsman

155
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,846
But he's still a driver.
- You're talking like my father

156
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:34,119
''Finish your business management, son.
Join and company and...''

157
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:37,687
One moment. Hold this

158
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:40,118
Give it to me...
- What are you doing? Leave it alone

159
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:43,125
''Wait a moment, Princess. l'll set
it right in a moment''

160
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,119
''Cut the drama, Amar.
People are watching''

161
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:47,920
But this is what you get when
you buy cheap roadside stuff

162
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:51,636
''Moneybags, we can't afford it!
We have to save every penny''

163
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:55,517
''Okay, there you are. lt's fixed.
- What are you doing, Amar?''

164
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:59,960
''l can wear it on my own! The ice-cream
is melting down to my fingers, Amar''

165
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:01,925
Let's go.
- Wait

166
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,516
''What are you doing, Amar?
l'm feeling shy''

167
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,718
Your feet are so soft

168
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:15,921
l'm feeling shy. Let go!
- Really. Your feet are so soft

169
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:18,322
See? The ice-cream has melted

170
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,844
Give me a cigarette

171
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:30,517
''Tingu, serve the cards.
- Where's the boot?''

172
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,118
''Well, beasts?
Booze and gambling?''

173
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:40,125
Here comes the punter!
- lt's terribly hot today

174
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:43,115
How did it go?
- Well...

175
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:49,597
Did you see your girl today?
- Girl? Which girl?

176
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:55,724
Well... what's her name...?
Lekha Khor-chumbe-kar...

177
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:59,836
''l know, she has an acid-tongue.
- Serve the cards, l say''

178
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:02,516
The typical Ghati Marathi Masala!

179
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:08,926
Amar Singh has gone and
fallen for a Marathi girl

180
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,601
Does she do the Lavani?
- Oh yes

181
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:14,521
She makes this tall man dance
better than she does!

182
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,605
lt's me

183
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:20,766
''lf l say l'm thinking about you,
what would you say?''

184
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:23,516
Just that you're the biggest liar
in the world!

185
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:32,117
''Just a few days left. After that,
it's good-bye to the college''

186
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:34,796
Thank God! l don't want
to keep studying another day!

187
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:38,521
What have you thought of doing?
- Daddy told me...

188
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:40,718
that l could do anything
after my graduation

189
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:43,726
''l'm thinking of going away to Delhi
to my aunt, to learn music''

190
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,641
There are several music institutions
there. What are your plans?

191
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:51,601
l... my dad wants me to go to
Ahmedabad and do a course in MBA

192
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:54,438
But l...
- A car-race driver!

193
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:58,845
''No, l know that's not practical.
So then...''

194
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:01,118
are you going away to Delhi?

195
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:06,518
''What does that mean?
- l mean, what will l do?''

196
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:08,922
What will you do? Pursue your
career and l'll pursue mine

197
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:12,597
We'll keep e-mailing each other and...
- Have we no relationship then?

198
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:16,115
''What relationship, moneybags?
- l'm in love with you''

199
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:23,925
''l'll clean it up, Amar''

200
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,840
''By the way, this is called
a good-luck charm''

201
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:31,597
Only the very fortunate have
these droppings fall on them

202
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:36,595
Could you say what you said
just a little while ago?

203
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:39,122
''Say it romantically,
with feeling''

204
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:43,838
''So you can poke more fun at me?
- No, l want to hear it again''

205
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,317
l said it and you heard it.
That's it

206
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:49,121
You're so unromantic! l'll go away
to Delhi at the earliest!

207
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,925
l'm in love with you.
- ls that any way of saying it?

208
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:56,925
How else am l to say it?
- Say it with a bit of feeling

209
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,118
Say it with a bit of love! Go on!

210
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:02,040
You take me for a monkey?
- A cute monkey

211
00:14:02,527 --> 00:14:05,917
''What's your answer going to be?
- Ask properly and l'll say, moneybags''

212
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:08,841
Stop calling me moneybags! Okay?

213
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,916
l love these traits of yours too

214
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:24,597
''Lekha, l love you.
l love you very much''

215
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,124
So do l

216
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:16,117
''lf it's my heart-beat
that is humming the song...''

217
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:20,123
why is it humming it at all?

218
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:24,722
lf life is now smiling...

219
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:28,599
why is it smiling?

220
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:33,841
''lf there is happiness,
there is also a fear...''

221
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:38,115
''l'm not in my senses,
but l do know this much...''

222
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:42,640
''my heart seeks something,
l have aspirations too...''

223
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:47,598
''my heart desires someone,
there is something l crave for''

224
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:53,118
My tongue fails me...

225
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:57,516
my lips keep longing...

226
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:02,117
how will l ever tell you...

227
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:06,124
when l was blown out of my senses

228
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:11,123
''My soul quivers
in my heart...''

229
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:15,117
why does it so quiver?

230
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:34,517
''Your body showers
a fragrance today''

231
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:41,527
''The passion in my heart
drains the colour off my face''

232
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,723
''There's no saying
when we might set out again...''

233
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:54,720
''dying flames in buried embers
might come alive again''

234
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:57,760
The Spring...

235
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,878
the splendour around...

236
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:01,924
these moments...

237
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:04,118
and these landscapes...

238
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:11,484
''why do they appear as if
they are something else today?''

239
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:17,118
''l remember the times
when we met earlier...''

240
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:21,520
this one is so different

241
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:25,798
Let's not talk about today...

242
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:30,120
''today's an entirely
different day''

243
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:34,677
lt tickles my heart...

244
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:39,120
''the mood is naughty.
Why does it tickle me?''

245
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:14,602
What did you touch me with?

246
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:19,116
''lt felt as if you had reached
the very depths of my heart''

247
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:23,442
What look have you cast at me?

248
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,915
''l seem to have been
struck by lightning''

249
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,518
This high...

250
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:36,524
a new high brings

251
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:40,758
l've lost my way...

252
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:45,117
l'm under a spell

253
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:51,325
''What utter helplessness
is putting my heart to test?''

254
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:58,961
''lf helplessness is
putting us to test...''

255
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:02,598
''why is it putting
us to test?''

256
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:19,841
When we met at the garment-store...

257
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:23,119
who was to now we'd get to be
so close so soon?

258
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:28,123
''Yes, it's very strange.
- But l feel nice. At least l do''

259
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:32,920
''Me too. l've never ever felt
like this about anyone, Amar''

260
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:39,724
''lt's so obvious to me, Lekha.
Ever since l fell in love with you...''

261
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:43,517
''whatever happened in my life before
you came along, means nothing to me''

262
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:47,800
''l love you a lot too, moneybags!''

263
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:50,721
''When are you going to stop
calling me ''moneybags''

264
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:53,122
When l stop loving you!

265
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,124
You must have the last word. What?
- Absolutely

266
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:35,519
Are you all right?
- lt's just a scratch

267
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:39,119
Don't you think you must give up
these silly games

268
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:42,441
You've got to do your MBA
after your graduation

269
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:46,116
l haven't given it
a thought yet

270
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:49,758
So what have you thought about?
What else are you going to do?

271
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:53,798
Let's wait and see

272
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:56,760
We don't have the time
to wait and see

273
00:21:57,127 --> 00:22:00,119
''The moment you have the degree, you
start running around for an admission''

274
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:03,115
l'll have a word with the trustees
at the llM

275
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:06,516
''Please, sir. Don't do that''

276
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:11,119
''lf l get an admission only on merit,
l will take it''

277
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:14,438
As you wish

278
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:20,120
''Although l haven't given it a thought,
even if do my MBA...''

279
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:24,122
l'd like to do it here in Pune.
- ln Pune?

280
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:27,278
There's nothing here in Pune

281
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:33,922
''There's enough for me, sir.
l like being here''

282
00:22:35,127 --> 00:22:38,119
As you wish.
l only wanted to help

283
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:43,126
''You weren't helping me, sir.
You were ordering me around''

284
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:46,726
That's a figment of
your rebellious mind

285
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:51,843
But you will learn. Don't you want
to consult a doctor?

286
00:22:52,127 --> 00:22:54,118
''No, sir. l'm fine''

287
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:58,840
l'm returning by tonight's flight.
ls there anything l can do for you?

288
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:02,444
''Nothing much, sir.
Please give Ma my love''

289
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:59,517
Who's Ulhas?
- My father

290
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:09,120
l just can't concentrate on my studies.
- Why?

291
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:11,837
Why ? Why indeed!

292
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:17,560
l keep thinking about the things
l can do with you

293
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:22,518
l now understand how you've
been looking at me of late

294
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:25,760
''Don't think you're very beautiful, okay?
- Not me''

295
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:27,958
But what can l do if you
find me beautiful?

296
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:31,517
All right. l agree...
But l can't help it

297
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:36,325
l always feel the urge...
to kiss you

298
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:41,120
l think you're going too far.
- Don't you feel like it too?

299
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:43,916
What?
- To kiss me?

300
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:49,839
''Actually, l haven't thought of it.
l'm not much experienced like you...''

301
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:52,595
Oh come off it! You must have done it
at some point or the other

302
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,923
At least now.
- When l was in school...

303
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:57,926
a boy in the neighbourhood
tried to kiss me forcibly

304
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:02,405
And Ulhas beat him up.
- So l've got to be careful

305
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:04,757
Oh yes. Just watch out

306
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:10,120
''lt's not very difficult, it's just
that it's the first time''

307
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:15,920
''Like we hugged each for the first time,
our lips will also...''

308
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:21,120
How many girls have you already kissed?
- Forget about the past

309
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:25,124
''You're the only one in my life now.
l admit, l made some mistakes''

310
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:27,518
Mistakes?
- Yes

311
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:31,124
''Before l met you, l didn't know
l was making a mistake. Now l know''

312
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:36,598
Everybody makes mistakes.
- So let's not make a mistake...

313
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:39,726
and kiss with all our heart?
- l don't know

314
00:25:40,127 --> 00:25:44,120
''l find it very strange.
- Do you love me, Lekha?''

315
00:25:45,687 --> 00:25:49,965
Do you really love?
You never told me

316
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:54,682
You never asked me.
- l now ask you

317
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:59,805
''Do you love me?
- No, l don't love you''

318
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:04,122
l love you very much

319
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:08,596
So can we kiss?

320
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:17,038
l didn't tell you to kiss me

321
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:24,524
That's what l thought.
- One second. Let me think

322
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,799
One second's over

323
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,119
''Wasn't very bad, was it?''

324
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:44,924
l'm feeling very scared.
- l'm nervous too

325
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:51,316
l'm feeling giddy.
- Didn't you like it?

326
00:26:58,127 --> 00:27:00,516
''That's not true, moneybags''

327
00:27:01,727 --> 00:27:04,719
''Maybe l'm feeling giddy,
because l liked it''

328
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,958
Where's the tall guy?

329
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:26,919
The tall guy?
- Where else?

330
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:29,756
He must be with the Marathi girl

331
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:34,118
Set it down

332
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:39,723
What are you up to? What?

333
00:27:43,647 --> 00:27:45,638
Drunkard!
- Beggar!

334
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,117
Our tall friend appears
to be pretty serious

335
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:55,836
But he does appear lost nowadays.
- He's making a meal of it

336
00:27:56,127 --> 00:27:59,722
Let him come.
l'll take him to task

337
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:11,125
Amar! What are you doing?
- What?

338
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:14,719
''What does what mean?
- Well, l was...''

339
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:19,120
''Whatever's happening between us
means a lot to me, Amar''

340
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:21,922
''Maybe you don't know it,
but l'm not used to all this''

341
00:28:22,207 --> 00:28:25,836
''ln fact, boys are scared of me.
- But l didn't do anything to...''

342
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:29,836
''Now don't say your hand strayed
without your knowledge, please''

343
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:39,120
''l was very excited and...
- Keep your hands in control, Amar''

344
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:42,527
lt's not that l don't want
to do all this

345
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:44,918
lt's not even as if l don't
know anything about sex

346
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:47,846
''l'm not a fool, Amar.
But morally speaking...''

347
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:51,119
l'd like to wait for all this
till we are married

348
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:57,917
''Why the long face...?
Try to understand me, Amar''

349
00:28:58,247 --> 00:29:01,717
''ln our society, if a boy does all these
things, he's called a macho man''

350
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:06,803
''But if a girl even wishes to have
a kiss, she's considered to be fast''

351
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:08,116
All right

352
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:10,958
Let's talk about something else...
- See?

353
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:13,118
That's the problem with our society

354
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:15,636
Man and woman just don't
want to talk about it

355
00:29:15,927 --> 00:29:19,317
''Without discussions, it's
made out to be a taboo''

356
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:23,396
And this very thing comes to be
a part of our every day life

357
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,122
But we can't talk about it!
What is this?

358
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:32,117
l never thought l'd ever discuss
these things with a girl

359
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:38,756
Marriages take place in our country.
They even have sex for years

360
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:41,038
But nobody talks about sex

361
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,720
Every living being has sex.
My parents have had sex...

362
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:49,722
so have your grandparents.
So not discuss it?

363
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:53,119
''Practically speaking, at least we
must talk about it, mustn't we?''

364
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:01,119
''Let's just kiss for the time being.
Nothing else, okay?''

365
00:30:01,607 --> 00:30:04,121
''As you command, your majesty.
- Come to me''

366
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:06,125
What for?

367
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:09,917
''Our exams are round the corner, Amar.
We had better start studying''

368
00:30:10,327 --> 00:30:13,319
''l don't understand.
- Every moment is precious, idiot...''

369
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:25,121
l didn't even realise
how the year went by

370
00:31:25,647 --> 00:31:27,638
''lt's such a great thing, isn't it?
- Oh yes''

371
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:30,801
There's also the sadness of
separating from our friends

372
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:34,119
l think it's time we said
good-bye to each other too

373
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,116
What do you mean?
- l'm going home tomorrow

374
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:40,436
For how many days?
- For a few months

375
00:31:40,687 --> 00:31:42,678
And what will l do?
- Go to your own house

376
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:45,687
But l don't want to go home.
l want to spend time with you

377
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:49,516
You're talking about
something impossible

378
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,799
''No, l'm going with you.
- Ulhas is going to kill you''

379
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:55,118
Will l tell him that l've
brought my boyfriend along?

380
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:57,238
''We live in a village, Amar.
Not in America''

381
00:31:57,447 --> 00:32:01,804
l'll stay in a hotel... anywhere.
- Are you out of your mind?

382
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:05,597
There's no hotel in my village.
And everyone knows me there

383
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:09,441
But l want to be with you...
what am l to do?

384
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:12,919
''Moneybags, it isn't as easy
as you think''

385
00:32:13,327 --> 00:32:16,637
You're a son of rich parents.
You can do anything

386
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:19,038
But l'm the daughter of
a poor chicken farmer

387
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:22,125
That's not my problem.
We love each other...

388
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:26,115
and are happy together. l can't
understand why we must separate!

389
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:30,600
''Moneybags, this is lndia. We have
our society, our culture our norms...''

390
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:34,119
''ln that case, let's get married.
- What?''

391
00:32:34,647 --> 00:32:37,320
''Now look, l've got to
marry someone some day''

392
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:41,041
''ln that case, why mustn't
l marry you right today?''

393
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:42,925
That's very kind of you

394
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:47,919
''lt's a nice idea, moneybags.
But it's not practical''

395
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:52,645
Why not? l'm in love with you.
We're happy together...

396
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:55,925
l want to marry you...
so why wait?

397
00:32:56,247 --> 00:32:58,920
lt'll solve our problems and we won't
have to look for ways to be together

398
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:01,925
Are you telling me that
we are getting married...

399
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:05,244
or are you proposing marriage to me?
- Call it what you will

400
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:09,116
''No, propose to me properly.
- You start joking again?''

401
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:11,119
''No jokes, moneybags.
l'm serious''

402
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:14,120
l've got to think of things
before l make up my mind

403
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:17,566
''Lekha, will you marry me?
- Moneybags...''

404
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:21,244
''with a bit of love, please. lt's
about marriage, not a business deal''

405
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,922
Are you mad? l asked you
if you will marry me!

406
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:26,044
With some more feeling

407
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:32,757
''Lekha, will you marry me?
- You're so filmi!''

408
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:44,355
''Yes, moneybags''

409
00:33:54,127 --> 00:33:57,597
''Chintu, where's Ulhas?
- He's feeding the chickens''

410
00:33:57,967 --> 00:33:59,958
''Want me to call him?
- No, we'll find him''

411
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:02,118
Take our luggage inside
- All right

412
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:06,516
''Remember, no big talk, no show off.
Just talk straight and...''

413
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:11,118
''Oh yes, l remember''

414
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,598
ls he the guy?

415
00:34:41,207 --> 00:34:45,120
Where did you find him?
ln a circus? Or was it the deserts?

416
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:50,757
''Think about his behaviour,
not mine''

417
00:34:52,127 --> 00:34:56,120
''Treat him nicely, Ulhas.
- Come on''

418
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:01,684
''l'll meet this chap very nicely.
- Watch it, Ulhas''

419
00:35:06,127 --> 00:35:09,756
''You asked for bread, Ulhas?
- Yes, give it to the workers''

420
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,638
''Ulhas, l'm going to make food.
- Wow! lt's going to be fun!''

421
00:35:18,127 --> 00:35:21,517
''Chintu, come on.
- l'm sick of eating what Chintu cooks''

422
00:35:21,927 --> 00:35:24,122
''lt's cauliflower and potato,
or potato and cauliflower''

423
00:35:24,647 --> 00:35:27,923
''Ask Chintu to fetch
some chicken, Lekha''

424
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,441
''You eat chicken, don't you?
- Yes, l do''

425
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:34,118
Because Lekha doesn't like
chicken and eggs

426
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:39,845
You'd say that too if you had to eat
chicken and eggs day in and day out

427
00:35:40,127 --> 00:35:42,846
''But don't worry. Although l won't
eat, l'll cook it for you''

428
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:46,915
You mustn't ever have had better
chicken than what you'll eat today

429
00:35:47,607 --> 00:35:49,757
lt will melt in your mouth

430
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:55,717
''Know what? lf there's lucky man in
the world apart from me, it's you''

431
00:35:57,927 --> 00:36:01,442
''No, you don't understand.
Lekha makes great food''

432
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:03,638
''l don't know about that,
because we live in a hostel''

433
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:06,839
This is one talent she has inherited
from her mother and me

434
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:11,598
Her mother wasn't very good looking...
God bless her soul

435
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:14,278
Neither did we go to school

436
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:17,121
But l don't know where
she learnt classical music

437
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:20,121
And l keep listening to
Dada Kondke's songs all day

438
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:23,838
But this talent of cooking
she got from her mother

439
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:27,402
Know why l married her mother?
- No

440
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:29,916
''How will you, unless l tell you?''

441
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:34,120
l once went to a neighbour's for food.
The food was so delicious...

442
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:37,917
l'd never had something like it in
my life. l asked who had prepared it

443
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:41,637
And l got to know it was a niece
of theirs from Kolhapur

444
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:44,595
Although l had heard of Kolhapuri
slippers and wrestlers...

445
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:46,838
it was the first time l heard
of Kolhapuri cooks

446
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:50,642
l told my parents right then that
even if a Kolhapuri girl is lame...

447
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:55,757
''or cripple, she cooks well and
she's the one l'll marry''

448
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:57,924
''Lucky for me, she wasn't a bad woman''

449
00:36:58,127 --> 00:37:00,118
But she wasn't as beautiful
as Lekha either

450
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:02,842
''She was pretty, all right''

451
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:09,521
There's something l must tell you
very clearly. Please don't mind

452
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:15,121
l had decided to say this to anyone
who married my daughter

453
00:37:15,927 --> 00:37:18,805
''Don't mind, okay?
- Not at all. Say whatever you wish to''

454
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:23,120
''lf you break my daughter's heart,
l'll break your legs''

455
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:30,115
Don't mind what l say. lf you
don't have confidence in yourself...

456
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:35,118
''and have no control, you can still
change your mind. lt's not too late''

457
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:39,756
''But remember, l'll do
as l said''

458
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:42,596
''Don't mind it, please.
- Not at all''

459
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,842
lf l were in your shoes and had
a daughter like yours...

460
00:37:47,247 --> 00:37:49,238
this is what l'd have said too

461
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:56,679
You're an okay guy!
So let's have one

462
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:58,918
One?
- Follow me

463
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:04,117
''ln any case, my daughter isn't a fool
to bring just about anyone home''

464
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:07,518
Come on in. Hurry up!

465
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:19,562
My daughter gives me hell whenever
she catches me drinking

466
00:38:20,127 --> 00:38:23,756
You know how the doctors are.
So l've got to drink on the sly

467
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:33,126
''Don't say anything to Lekha.
- No, l won't''

468
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:39,924
Where's the opener...?

469
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:41,646
Over there

470
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:49,124
Drink it up.
- l don't drink...

471
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:55,118
''At your age, l had two bottles!
- l haven't yet...''

472
00:38:56,927 --> 00:38:59,646
l don't want to...
- l don't want to listen to anything

473
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:04,518
We understand each other pretty well.
This must remain between us

474
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:06,998
''Don't say anything to Lekha.
- No, not at all, sir''

475
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:09,925
''ln any case, we're related now.
- Already ?''

476
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:13,643
''l mean, sir...
- Forget about sir and uncle...''

477
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:18,796
''my parents called me Ulhas. Ulhas.
- All right, sir...''

478
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:22,005
Sir again? My name is Ulhas

479
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:27,118
Good. Drink it up

480
00:39:30,207 --> 00:39:32,926
May l say something to you?
- Go ahead

481
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:36,603
l hadn't even dreamt that
l'd be having booze...

482
00:39:36,927 --> 00:39:41,523
with my future father-in-law in
just half an hour of our meeting

483
00:39:45,727 --> 00:39:48,719
Neither did l dream of it!
- Who's that?

484
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,517
''l want to wash my hands, Amar''

485
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:11,127
This mouth-freshener.
She catches the stink

486
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:21,561
The two of you together?
- l was explaining...

487
00:40:21,847 --> 00:40:25,840
how to switch on the geyser.
- So why did you shut the door?

488
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:27,924
Was it shut?
- lt was

489
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:31,119
And you need to take a bath.
You stink of chicken

490
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:33,119
Poke fun at Ulhas. Go on

491
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:37,116
''The Dada Kondke film is starting.
Chintu, come quickly. Where are you?''

492
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:58,119
''Ulhas, hurry up!
- Coming''

493
00:40:58,607 --> 00:41:01,121
What a wretched bus.
lt stalled twice on the way

494
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:04,115
ls the programme over?
- lt's about to. You're on time

495
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:06,682
''Are there a lot many people?
- Yes, a few''

496
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,515
l can't understand anything
of this classical music

497
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:21,678
He frolics with the other woman...

498
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:26,519
he asks not about my well-being

499
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:58,125
''He inflicts tyranny on me
every time he comes...''

500
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:03,526
that's how my husband is

501
00:43:35,207 --> 00:43:37,516
''Let's go...
- Listen, son''

502
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:49,118
lt'll be over in five minutes

503
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:30,478
You were excellent. Amazing

504
00:44:31,807 --> 00:44:34,799
''l never knew you could
sing so well, Lekha''

505
00:44:35,727 --> 00:44:40,118
lt shows what fools you are and
what you know about classical music

506
00:44:40,807 --> 00:44:43,321
''l made so many mistakes, l'd have
been admonished by a teacher''

507
00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:47,919
''No, you weren't so bad, Lekha.
- l see. Now comes the truth!''

508
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:50,124
Not very bad?

509
00:44:51,007 --> 00:44:55,000
Which is why l love you both so much.
You like everything l do

510
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:01,125
My parents and your dad
are worlds apart

511
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:04,599
Your dad is as open
as the skies

512
00:45:05,007 --> 00:45:07,601
And my parents are as hard as rock

513
00:45:07,927 --> 00:45:09,997
They don't believe in displaying
their emotions

514
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,526
Really?

515
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:16,439
''When l told them l'm getting married,
they were really stunned''

516
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:19,839
But naturally.
What are you in a hurry for?

517
00:45:20,207 --> 00:45:24,120
You won't let me do the things l want
to do with you before we are married

518
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,917
So that's the reason for your haste!
- What else?

519
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:32,806
''You're going too far, moneybags.
You're teasing me?''

520
00:45:33,127 --> 00:45:36,119
''Oh yes. lt's happening
only because of you, Lekha''

521
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:38,438
l know that!

522
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:46,439
Wow! Such a big house!

523
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:51,120
''Four walls, actually.
- l'm scared to go in''

524
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:55,119
May we go back?
- What's there to be scared of?

525
00:45:55,607 --> 00:45:58,838
lt's just a formality. They'll ask you
some silly questions...

526
00:45:59,127 --> 00:46:01,516
which don't even merit
a proper answer

527
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:04,122
''There's little they can do,
in any case...''

528
00:46:04,447 --> 00:46:08,520
''because l've already made up my mind.
We are going to get married, okay?''

529
00:46:15,447 --> 00:46:17,005
''Welcome, sir''

530
00:46:17,127 --> 00:46:19,516
''Look at him!
- lt's fun, isn't it?''

531
00:46:52,647 --> 00:46:54,478
What is your full name?

532
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:08,717
lt's a Marathi word.
- l see

533
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:15,521
''So how have you been, son?
Will you have a drink?''

534
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:17,525
''No thank you, sir''

535
00:47:19,207 --> 00:47:22,677
How was your journey?
- Very nice. and fast too

536
00:47:23,327 --> 00:47:25,318
Amar drives very fast anyway.

537
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,517
''Not as fast as you, sir.
- lt shouldn't be too''

538
00:47:34,127 --> 00:47:36,925
''Well, we ought to leave now''

539
00:47:38,447 --> 00:47:40,597
''You're here for dinner,
aren't you?''

540
00:47:40,967 --> 00:47:42,958
But we won't be able to stay

541
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:45,800
''Of course, we're staying over
for dinner''

542
00:47:46,127 --> 00:47:48,766
''No, l have an important
lecture tomorrow''

543
00:47:53,127 --> 00:47:55,880
You are staying over for dinner.
That's an order

544
00:47:56,527 --> 00:48:00,122
''We can't stay, sir.
- We must stay, Amar''

545
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:01,800
What for?

546
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:05,998
Because l'm hungry

547
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:15,118
ltalian food. Do you like it?

548
00:48:15,447 --> 00:48:17,677
l like everything except
chicken and eggs

549
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:18,836
Why so?

550
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:22,124
Because that's what my father fed me
in bringing me up

551
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,922
Where did you spend your childhood?
- Vita

552
00:48:25,127 --> 00:48:27,038
A village between
Pune and Kolhapur

553
00:48:27,327 --> 00:48:30,603
What business does your daddy do?
- He's into the poultry business

554
00:48:34,887 --> 00:48:38,118
''What's the name of his company?
- No, that's not how it is''

555
00:48:38,527 --> 00:48:42,122
My daddy is a chicken farmer.
He runs the Ulhas Poultry Farm

556
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:45,127
He must have around five
or six thousand birds

557
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:55,440
The pasta sauce is excellent.
Can l have the recipe?

558
00:48:55,687 --> 00:48:58,121
''Sure, the cook will give it to you''

559
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:03,119
Have you given them the news

560
00:49:04,327 --> 00:49:07,125
lt would be premature to tell them

561
00:49:08,127 --> 00:49:09,924
What is it?

562
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:12,766
Your daddy's getting nominated
to the House of Elders

563
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,999
''lt's a great thing, isn't it?
- lt's a huge honour''

564
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,119
We've finished our food.
We must leave now

565
00:49:25,127 --> 00:49:26,719
Amar...

566
00:49:30,127 --> 00:49:32,925
''You could at least have
congratulated him, Amar!''

567
00:49:33,327 --> 00:49:35,124
l didn't consider it special

568
00:49:35,327 --> 00:49:38,444
l found the atmosphere so sickening.
- Me too

569
00:49:40,207 --> 00:49:44,644
What did you find sickening?
- You behaved so badly with your dad

570
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:49,120
''How about the way he was treating me?
- You drove him to it, Amar''

571
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:51,722
l can say that about him too

572
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:54,282
You didn't lose a single opportunity
to run him down

573
00:49:54,487 --> 00:49:56,717
''You tried to belittle him every time.
- You won't understand, Lekha''

574
00:49:56,847 --> 00:49:58,439
lt's impossible to make him bow

575
00:50:00,607 --> 00:50:03,519
ls that what you think?
- Yes. And what's wrong with that?

576
00:50:07,127 --> 00:50:11,166
''You do love me, but strangely enough
you're taking advantage of my poverty''

577
00:50:12,127 --> 00:50:14,516
You love making your father bow

578
00:50:15,127 --> 00:50:17,516
''What can l say,
if you think like that''

579
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:19,918
''l'm not thinking anything
like that, moneybags''

580
00:50:20,127 --> 00:50:23,005
l love everything about you
as much as l love you

581
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:26,644
''Be it your name, your stubbornness,
your family background...''

582
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:30,517
''it makes no difference, even if
you are Prithviraj Ranawat's son''

583
00:50:32,127 --> 00:50:34,118
Care for some tea or coffee?

584
00:50:38,047 --> 00:50:40,402
''The pasta sauce was tasty,
wasn't it?''

585
00:50:46,687 --> 00:50:50,521
You haven't said anything about Lekha.
- What will l say?

586
00:50:52,127 --> 00:50:54,516
What do you think?

587
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:07,121
''Despite her background, she has
completed her education...''

588
00:51:07,527 --> 00:51:10,837
''What are you getting at, sir?
- What l'm getting at...''

589
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:14,119
''has nothing to do with the girl,
it has to do with you''

590
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:18,518
With your rebellion

591
00:51:18,727 --> 00:51:23,517
l can't understand why you must
dub my marriage to a beautiful...

592
00:51:23,927 --> 00:51:28,717
and talented girl as a rebellion.
lt isn't that she's illiterate either

593
00:51:30,127 --> 00:51:34,120
''She's not much either.
- What really rankles, sir?''

594
00:51:34,927 --> 00:51:39,364
''Her caste, or is it her poverty?
- What do you see in her, Amar?''

595
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:45,722
''l must leave, sir.
- Stop acting childish and sit down''

596
00:51:50,127 --> 00:51:54,598
''Now look, Amar.
You're only 21''

597
00:51:56,487 --> 00:51:58,921
''This is not love,
it's infatuation''

598
00:52:02,927 --> 00:52:06,522
''When l was in college,
l too was just like you''

599
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:10,119
But l eventually
married your mother

600
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:14,763
''Maybe you did, sir.
But l'm not you''

601
00:52:19,447 --> 00:52:21,438
''Be sensible, Amar''

602
00:52:22,127 --> 00:52:25,597
l'm not dictating whom you must
marry and whom you mustn't

603
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:28,124
That's your life

604
00:52:29,487 --> 00:52:33,116
All l'm asking you to do is
to complete your MBA first...

605
00:52:33,607 --> 00:52:36,724
''stand on your own two feet,
and then...''

606
00:52:37,127 --> 00:52:40,437
l'll personally get you married
to anyone you wish

607
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:44,759
But so long as you are
dependent on me...

608
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:49,723
you will have to do as l say
- Dependent?

609
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:55,122
''Yes, dependent.
You live off my money''

610
00:52:55,487 --> 00:52:59,116
The money my grandfather left you?
- Yes

611
00:53:00,207 --> 00:53:04,917
''But neither am l dead,
nor did you inherit anything''

612
00:53:06,127 --> 00:53:09,836
l can look after myself.
- Very well

613
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:17,643
''Marry anyone you wish to,
it makes no difference to me''

614
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:22,519
Even if she's Lekha...
or the princess of Jaipur

615
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:28,921
''Remember, after your marriage,
you will not get a penny from me''

616
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:32,127
''l told you, sir.
l'm not like you''

617
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:36,441
l choose love over money.
Not money

618
00:53:52,127 --> 00:53:54,846
''l don't understand, Amar.
- l need a scholarship for my MBA sir''

619
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,358
''Yes, sir. That's why l'm here''

620
00:53:58,967 --> 00:54:03,119
lf we're going to give the son of
Prithviraj Ranawat a scholarship...

621
00:54:03,927 --> 00:54:06,521
whom will the poor students turn to?

622
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:11,724
''As you know, Amar, we haven't
started a charitable organisation''

623
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:16,120
Your father is a patron of this college.
- l have nothing to do with him anymore

624
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:21,125
''As l said, l have nothing
to do with him anymore''

625
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:28,686
''That's very unfortunate.
- Unfortunate, it is''

626
00:54:29,127 --> 00:54:32,324
''Which is why l'm here.
l'm getting married, sir''

627
00:54:32,847 --> 00:54:34,917
My wife and l will take up
part-time jobs...

628
00:54:35,127 --> 00:54:39,120
but we still won't be able to meet
the high fees and our expenses

629
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,119
''When l took an admission,
l didn't know all this would happen''

630
00:54:46,487 --> 00:54:49,320
Call from Mr Dholpude sir.
- Tell him that l'm not in

631
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:57,523
l understand what you're saying.
But this is an office...

632
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:01,523
and l don't want to interfere
in your family affairs

633
00:55:02,207 --> 00:55:07,122
But l'd still suggest that you the two
of you sit down and sort out the matter

634
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:13,757
l'll see how my family
gives you a donation

635
00:55:14,487 --> 00:55:16,478
That's not correct!

636
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:27,918
What a bumpy ride!

637
00:55:28,127 --> 00:55:30,846
''We're going to Vita,
not London or Paris, moneybags''

638
00:55:32,127 --> 00:55:34,118
l want to say something to you

639
00:55:35,247 --> 00:55:37,636
''l have never asked you
for anything, Lekha''

640
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:40,118
''But today, l ask''

641
00:55:40,607 --> 00:55:45,317
You will never give me any suggestion
or advise regarding my father

642
00:55:46,967 --> 00:55:51,518
You will not even talk about him.
You won't even utter his name

643
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:54,959
''lf that's how you want it,
that's how it will be''

644
00:55:58,127 --> 00:55:59,719
May l...

645
00:56:00,207 --> 00:56:02,641
Go on.
- You say it

646
00:56:03,287 --> 00:56:07,121
Have you told Ulhas?
- About my father...

647
00:56:07,607 --> 00:56:09,598
l follow just one principle.
- What?

648
00:56:09,927 --> 00:56:14,125
Never hide anything from your father.
- So he knows l'm poor now?

649
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,124
''He doesn't mind, does he?''

650
00:56:18,327 --> 00:56:22,115
''Apart from drinking in the bathroom,
you have something more in common''

651
00:56:23,127 --> 00:56:26,119
''Still, he'd have been happy
if l had the money, isn't it?''

652
00:56:26,607 --> 00:56:28,438
Wouldn't you?

653
00:56:32,527 --> 00:56:34,916
''Leave it all to me, Amar.
Don't worry''

654
00:56:35,247 --> 00:56:38,523
l know how to manage the household
in little money and even have savings

655
00:56:38,927 --> 00:56:41,919
l was brought up in poverty.
l'll do something surely

656
00:56:42,327 --> 00:56:46,605
l'll give tuitions in music and even
manage to get some money out of Ulhas

657
00:56:47,127 --> 00:56:49,118
What happens of your
training in classical music?

658
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:51,756
''That can come later.
- No, Lekha''

659
00:56:52,127 --> 00:56:54,595
l don't want you to
sacrifice your dreams

660
00:56:54,927 --> 00:56:56,918
l'll never be able to forgive myself.
- Amar...

661
00:56:57,127 --> 00:57:00,119
''l see my dreams being realised,
not sacrificed''

662
00:57:00,647 --> 00:57:02,922
l'm backing a winning horse

663
00:57:03,607 --> 00:57:06,121
Once you've completed your MBA
and found a job...

664
00:57:06,607 --> 00:57:11,123
it's going to be fun all the way.
We'll even go to London and Paris

665
00:57:11,607 --> 00:57:15,122
lt's only a matter of two years.
l'm not losing my voice in 2 years

666
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:17,358
And where's the money
in classical music?

667
00:57:18,247 --> 00:57:21,796
So you've consoled yourself?
- Stupid! l'm so happy

668
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:24,038
We're getting married

669
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:28,845
Not yet. Say thanks
after two years!

670
00:57:33,127 --> 00:57:35,641
Your parents are not attending
your wedding? What madness is this?

671
00:57:35,927 --> 00:57:37,918
Give me their telephone number. l'll
call them and make them see reason!

672
00:57:38,127 --> 00:57:41,722
''No, Ulhas. Amar doesn't want that!
- Who's Amar to not want it?''

673
00:57:42,127 --> 00:57:44,516
''Give me their telephone number,
l'll talk to them''

674
00:57:45,647 --> 00:57:49,606
Listen to me. l've done what l could.
Nothing can solve this problem

675
00:57:50,007 --> 00:57:51,998
''What have you done that had
no solution, Amar?''

676
00:57:52,287 --> 00:57:54,847
''You tried as a son,
l'll try like a father''

677
00:57:55,127 --> 00:57:59,120
''You'll never know what it means to be
a father, what respect it commands''

678
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,605
''Very few people understand that, Amar.
- Especially in my family''

679
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:06,124
God! How difficult it is
to reason with the youth!

680
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:10,526
''Forget it, Ulhas. We're together
and we're getting married''

681
00:58:10,847 --> 00:58:12,838
''All right, l can understand''

682
00:58:13,447 --> 00:58:16,120
No point in getting upset
on a happy occasion

683
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:21,120
l've waited for this day
ever since Lekha was born

684
00:58:22,727 --> 00:58:25,116
l've been collecting every penny
for this day

685
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:28,837
''l'll give you such a grand wedding,
the whole village will be stunned''

686
00:58:29,127 --> 00:58:33,917
''Ulhas, the wedding will be memorable,
but not ostentatious''

687
00:58:34,447 --> 00:58:36,438
What do you mean?
- l mean...

688
00:58:36,607 --> 00:58:40,520
''we get married not to show off,
but to live in this world''

689
00:58:41,007 --> 00:58:44,602
We need a house to live in
and money to keep it going

690
00:58:45,087 --> 00:58:49,126
Which we don't have.
Amar has to complete his MBA

691
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:53,601
l don't want him to take up any job
at the cost of his education

692
00:58:54,127 --> 00:59:00,521
''l know you've collected 150,000
for my wedding, despite all odds''

693
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:06,122
''Give us the 150,000.
We'll have a marriage in court''

694
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,322
A court marriage?
- Yes

695
00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:11,598
That's not happening!
You will not say a word

696
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:13,918
lt's my responsibility
to get you married!

697
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,038
''As for the rest of the money,
l'll bring that too''

698
00:59:16,207 --> 00:59:19,119
You'll take a loan?
That's just what l don't want

699
00:59:19,327 --> 00:59:21,921
But l don't want you to have
a court marriage!

700
00:59:22,247 --> 00:59:25,125
Even God doesn't bless a wedding
that has no ceremonies

701
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:27,358
Even religion does not...
- Okay!

702
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:31,520
We'll have a small prayer at home.
- l've got to face people in society!

703
00:59:32,007 --> 00:59:36,000
They will say Ulhas Khurzvekar couldn't
even get his daughter married decently!

704
00:59:36,527 --> 00:59:39,519
''What will you mother
have to say, Lekha? What?''

705
00:59:40,087 --> 00:59:43,523
Mother will want you to do that which
gives your daughter happiness

706
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:46,516
And l know what you want too

707
00:59:47,127 --> 00:59:49,561
''You'll be happy if l'm happy.
You will, won't you?''

708
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:52,123
Absolutely. Which is why...
- lt's settled then

709
00:59:52,527 --> 00:59:57,521
''Hold the marriage in 25,000 rupees.
And give us the rest of the money''

710
00:59:57,847 --> 00:59:59,519
''Don't haggle with me, please!''

711
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,641
That's a habit of mine
and l will do it

712
01:00:03,127 --> 01:00:08,121
''lf you spend more than 25,000, we'll
take that much less from our amount''

713
01:00:08,927 --> 01:00:14,126
''l know what you have been through to
bring me up, to give me happiness''

714
01:00:14,727 --> 01:00:17,366
But l don't want to burden you
with my marriage

715
01:00:17,727 --> 01:00:22,847
''You are not a burden, my child.
You mean the life to me. My very life!''

716
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:31,924
''When we love each other so much,
why must we bother about people?''

717
01:00:32,927 --> 01:00:36,124
''You love me, or you love the world?
- You''

718
01:00:36,447 --> 01:00:38,836
''You're the one, my child.
lt's you''

719
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:41,800
Then do as l say.
- God!

720
01:00:42,207 --> 01:00:44,926
lt's so difficult
to reason with them

721
01:00:45,207 --> 01:00:48,119
l'll do as you say

722
01:00:48,567 --> 01:00:50,842
Say it with a smile

723
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:57,641
Ulhas! You must have
that drink today!

724
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:01,558
''Welcome, Ganpatrao''

725
01:01:05,127 --> 01:01:07,516
So happy to have you here

726
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:18,521
Didn't l ask you not to?
How come we have so many guests?

727
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:21,726
''l can't drive them away now, can l?''

728
01:01:22,127 --> 01:01:25,597
l don't know how they got to know
about what we discussed

729
01:01:26,007 --> 01:01:28,123
Looks like l was drunk.
- So?

730
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:31,917
''The cooks, the band,
the decorator...''

731
01:01:32,127 --> 01:01:35,836
they're working of their own
free will. l don't need to pay anyone

732
01:01:36,207 --> 01:01:38,926
''Tell me the truth, Ulhas.
- lt's the truth, Lekha''

733
01:01:39,207 --> 01:01:42,119
You needn't worry at all.
Just be happy

734
01:01:44,927 --> 01:01:48,124
l'm not going to forgive you.
- When did l ask you to?

735
01:02:40,887 --> 01:02:42,878
Open it.
- What's in it?

736
01:02:43,207 --> 01:02:45,926
Tickets for Himachal Pradesh
and hotel bookings

737
01:02:47,127 --> 01:02:49,118
Have your nuptials there

738
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:52,922
The two of you are flying
for Himachal tomorrow...

739
01:02:53,127 --> 01:02:56,119
where a beautiful hotel is
waiting for this lovely couple

740
01:02:57,127 --> 01:02:59,402
Honeymoon in Himachal!

741
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:34,122
''Beat the drum, drink the opiate,
and have fun''

742
01:03:35,007 --> 01:03:38,443
''Dance, make merry...
look into your beloved's eyes''

743
01:03:55,447 --> 01:03:58,007
The two of us are lost

744
01:03:59,447 --> 01:04:02,120
''Neither asleep, nor awake''

745
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:11,124
''We're in our senses
no longer''

746
01:04:12,127 --> 01:04:13,924
Steady me...

747
01:04:14,127 --> 01:04:15,924
hold me in your arms...

748
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:19,437
before l'm lost

749
01:04:20,487 --> 01:04:26,119
''ln my arms,
l'll do today...''

750
01:04:26,607 --> 01:04:30,122
''what l haven't
done till today''

751
01:04:30,647 --> 01:04:32,638
The two of us are lost

752
01:04:32,927 --> 01:04:34,918
''Neither asleep, nor awake''

753
01:04:35,047 --> 01:04:38,119
''We're in our senses
no longer''

754
01:04:39,127 --> 01:04:40,924
Steady me...

755
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,958
hold me in your arms...

756
01:04:43,127 --> 01:04:46,437
before l'm lost

757
01:05:08,127 --> 01:05:12,120
''Why are the skies moving?
Why's the earth rotating?''

758
01:05:12,527 --> 01:05:16,122
''Everything sways with us
in a state of high''

759
01:05:16,527 --> 01:05:19,917
This is so much of fun

760
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:38,961
''Come, let's do away with
all these distances''

761
01:05:39,447 --> 01:05:43,122
''Wait a while...
l'm helpless as of now''

762
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:46,360
''Let's go home,
it's evening already''

763
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,518
The two of us are lost

764
01:05:49,847 --> 01:05:51,838
''Neither asleep, nor awake''

765
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:55,119
''We're in our senses
no longer''

766
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,798
Steady me...

767
01:05:58,047 --> 01:06:00,003
hold me in your arms...

768
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:03,517
before l'm lost

769
01:06:04,447 --> 01:06:10,124
''ln my arms,
l'll do today...''

770
01:06:10,487 --> 01:06:14,116
''what l haven't
done till today''

771
01:06:39,927 --> 01:06:43,636
''How long will we roam like this?
lt's a strange path''

772
01:06:44,127 --> 01:06:47,642
''Difficult it is to find
the goal, in times like this''

773
01:06:48,127 --> 01:06:51,517
''Do not sit in the
middle of the road''

774
01:07:06,127 --> 01:07:10,325
Where have we landed?

775
01:07:10,807 --> 01:07:14,641
How are we going to get home?

776
01:07:15,127 --> 01:07:18,517
''lt's for you to
think of that, my love''

777
01:07:19,127 --> 01:07:20,958
The two of us are lost

778
01:07:21,127 --> 01:07:23,118
''Neither asleep, nor awake''

779
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:26,603
''We're in our senses
no longer''

780
01:07:27,407 --> 01:07:29,125
Steady me...

781
01:07:29,447 --> 01:07:31,438
hold me in your arms...

782
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:34,803
before l'm lost

783
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:41,844
''ln my arms,
l'll do today...''

784
01:07:42,127 --> 01:07:45,517
''what l haven't
done till today''

785
01:07:46,127 --> 01:07:48,118
''ln my arms,
l'll do today...''

786
01:07:48,327 --> 01:07:51,524
''what l haven't
done till today''

787
01:08:07,127 --> 01:08:09,436
What funny sadhus!

788
01:08:11,127 --> 01:08:15,962
You played the temptress too.
- The opiate drove me mad

789
01:08:27,207 --> 01:08:29,198
What for? We're married now?

790
01:08:29,527 --> 01:08:33,122
Are we going to have babies rightaway?
No babies for two years

791
01:08:35,127 --> 01:08:37,118
You want a baby?
- No way

792
01:08:37,967 --> 01:08:40,117
''So we've got to be careful
for two years, moneybags''

793
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:43,956
Two years? l'll go mad.
You aren't thinking about me

794
01:08:45,127 --> 01:08:47,118
l'm talking of family planning

795
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:53,683
Condom? l don't have one.
- l have a bag full

796
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:55,844
So get one out immediately

797
01:08:56,127 --> 01:08:58,436
''How will l have any,
when you don't ?''

798
01:08:58,647 --> 01:09:01,002
But where will l find a condom?
You don't understand!

799
01:09:01,247 --> 01:09:03,841
The milkman must have some!

800
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,437
From the medical store of course!
- Oh yes. lt's close by

801
01:09:08,127 --> 01:09:10,322
l'll go and get it.
Will it be open at this hour?

802
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,836
l'm going with you.
l'm not staying here alone

803
01:09:13,047 --> 01:09:15,959
No way. How shameless!
What will we say...?

804
01:09:18,407 --> 01:09:20,716
Why should l feel shy?
Who knows me here in Manali?

805
01:09:20,927 --> 01:09:23,805
''You don't understand!
- Please, moneybags!''

806
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:26,721
l can't stay a moment without you

807
01:09:28,127 --> 01:09:31,642
''Don't say such things, Lekha.
l don't have the time right now...''

808
01:09:32,047 --> 01:09:35,119
''Take me along, please!
- All right''

809
01:09:35,527 --> 01:09:37,518
''But you'll stand far away, okay?''

810
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:40,837
Don't forget your promise

811
01:09:55,127 --> 01:09:56,116
Yes?

812
01:09:56,367 --> 01:09:57,925
Write down...

813
01:10:03,567 --> 01:10:05,717
One moment. l'll write it down.
- Go on

814
01:10:09,527 --> 01:10:11,916
That's not in stock.
l'll get it later.

815
01:10:12,127 --> 01:10:14,118
lt's an emergency.
Give me this one

816
01:10:15,607 --> 01:10:16,722
Next?

817
01:10:20,127 --> 01:10:22,118
A Johnson Baby's soap...

818
01:10:25,127 --> 01:10:27,516
''Got it? Let's go.
- No, l didn't get it''

819
01:10:27,767 --> 01:10:29,917
What were you doing there?
Don't they have any?

820
01:10:30,207 --> 01:10:33,324
''No, there were people coming and
going. l was about to say it...''

821
01:10:33,527 --> 01:10:38,647
when this woman arrived with a child.
- lf you don't get the condoms...

822
01:10:38,967 --> 01:10:42,118
l'll be like the woman with a child.
What's there to be shy about?

823
01:10:42,527 --> 01:10:45,121
''The whole world buys them,
the Government advertises it!''

824
01:10:45,527 --> 01:10:48,121
Who knows us here?
Who are you bothered about?

825
01:10:48,647 --> 01:10:51,525
lt isn't as if you have
never bought it before

826
01:10:54,527 --> 01:10:56,119
All right. l'm going

827
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:59,516
''Mister, l need some...
- Yes?''

828
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:02,924
Yes?

829
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:22,915
What was the last thing you said?

830
01:11:26,527 --> 01:11:29,121
Cotton ear-buds.
To clean my ears

831
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:37,119
Thank God you've come. lt was
strange waiting here on my own

832
01:11:37,447 --> 01:11:39,438
So you've finally got it?
- l haven't got it

833
01:11:40,127 --> 01:11:42,118
So what have you got?

834
01:11:45,127 --> 01:11:48,119
''What's all this, Amar? Why do
we need soap at the hotel?''

835
01:11:48,607 --> 01:11:52,122
We have toothpaste.
And who's got a cough?

836
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:57,559
Hey! what are you doing?
Lekha...

837
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,438
You're a girl. Aren't you
ashamed to buy condoms?

838
01:12:00,647 --> 01:12:02,638
Girls have to look
after themselves

839
01:12:02,927 --> 01:12:04,758
l'm not going with you!
- l didn't ask you to

840
01:12:08,127 --> 01:12:10,118
''What...? Of course, madam!''

841
01:12:10,487 --> 01:12:12,478
What brands do you have?

842
01:12:14,607 --> 01:12:15,835
These

843
01:12:17,127 --> 01:12:20,517
How much for this one?
- 14 rupees

844
01:12:21,647 --> 01:12:24,525
And this one?
- 20 rupees

845
01:12:24,767 --> 01:12:26,917
''Why the difference?
- Actually, madam...''

846
01:12:27,127 --> 01:12:29,118
''this has six, and this has three''

847
01:12:32,127 --> 01:12:34,595
And this one?
- 8 rupees

848
01:12:35,127 --> 01:12:38,836
8 rupees for 3?
- The quality isn't very nice

849
01:12:40,127 --> 01:12:43,119
''Don't you have a bigger packet?
- l do, madam''

850
01:12:47,967 --> 01:12:51,118
''Here you are. 20 pieces, madam.
For 70 rupees''

851
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:55,800
All right. Give me this one.
- Very well

852
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,724
''Here you are, madam''

853
01:13:30,127 --> 01:13:33,836
l couldn't imagine it would take so much
time to move into such a small room

854
01:13:34,127 --> 01:13:36,925
''This isn't a room.
lt's our first house, moneybags''

855
01:13:37,127 --> 01:13:39,118
My servants live in better places

856
01:13:39,607 --> 01:13:42,121
Maybe you will understand
them better now

857
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:46,836
Let's get Goodnight. Many mosquitoes.
- A coil will do

858
01:13:47,127 --> 01:13:49,118
lt creates a lot of smoke

859
01:13:49,447 --> 01:13:52,644
What happened?
- l can't walk anymore. l'm tired

860
01:13:53,127 --> 01:13:56,119
''Carry me, please.
- Are you out of your mind?''

861
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:59,121
You will carry me
if you really love me

862
01:13:59,407 --> 01:14:02,524
Emotional blackmail?
You take me for a fool?

863
01:14:03,127 --> 01:14:04,924
A sweet fool

864
01:14:05,647 --> 01:14:07,638
People are watching. Let's go

865
01:14:10,127 --> 01:14:12,595
They're watching us.
- So what?

866
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:16,317
''l could even be ill,
l could be feeling giddy''

867
01:14:17,607 --> 01:14:19,598
Nobody wins with you

868
01:14:32,207 --> 01:14:35,995
What do you want?
- You

869
01:14:37,927 --> 01:14:40,725
But we've got to eat.
- l'd rather eat you

870
01:14:45,687 --> 01:14:49,600
''Moneybags, this is our
first day at home''

871
01:14:51,967 --> 01:14:54,356
l'm talking about food

872
01:14:56,207 --> 01:14:59,802
Anything you like.
Anything cheap

873
01:15:00,127 --> 01:15:04,120
''Cheap, from tomorrow.
Today, l want to make you happy''

874
01:15:04,607 --> 01:15:07,519
What dish in the world
is your favourite dish?

875
01:15:08,447 --> 01:15:12,520
Anything you like.
- How about bittergourd?

876
01:15:13,047 --> 01:15:18,041
Not bittergourd.
Crabs Masala

877
01:15:19,927 --> 01:15:21,918
You asked me and l told you

878
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:26,517
''Go and get the crabs,
l'll fish out a recipe''

879
01:15:34,127 --> 01:15:36,118
ln a moment

880
01:15:39,287 --> 01:15:41,926
Look at the fresh crabs l got.
- l've found a recipe too

881
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,721
Let me put it
in this pan

882
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:49,924
They're alive!

883
01:15:50,207 --> 01:15:54,120
They're supposed to be fresh.
You must cook them in boiling water

884
01:15:54,607 --> 01:15:58,839
How heartless!
l can't kill a living being!

885
01:16:30,327 --> 01:16:32,318
Nice lentil curry

886
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,998
Nice rice too

887
01:16:37,607 --> 01:16:40,121
That's what we will get
in our budget

888
01:19:10,087 --> 01:19:11,361
Mrs Rana...?

889
01:19:13,447 --> 01:19:15,119
l was cleaning up...

890
01:19:15,327 --> 01:19:17,841
please come in.
Amar's not in

891
01:19:18,127 --> 01:19:20,516
''Please sit down.
- How are you, Lekha?''

892
01:19:20,847 --> 01:19:22,838
l'm all right

893
01:19:24,207 --> 01:19:26,596
''Go and wait in the car, driver''

894
01:19:29,127 --> 01:19:32,836
Please sit down.
l'll set everything right

895
01:19:33,127 --> 01:19:35,118
l'll go and get ready

896
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,718
''lt's too loud, isn't it?''

897
01:19:42,047 --> 01:19:44,117
lt was a song l like.
- Really?

898
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:47,359
Yes. Amar was a small child
when l took him to this film

899
01:19:48,127 --> 01:19:50,516
lt featured Rajesh Khanna
and Mumtaz

900
01:19:52,647 --> 01:19:55,115
Do you like R.D. Burman?
- Very much

901
01:19:57,207 --> 01:19:59,846
l have all his songs.
- Me too

902
01:20:00,127 --> 01:20:02,436
Do you have his Bengali album?

903
01:20:02,647 --> 01:20:04,922
That's the only one l couldn't find

904
01:20:05,207 --> 01:20:07,675
''Heard of Gautam Rajyadaksha,
the photographer?''

905
01:20:07,927 --> 01:20:11,840
Of course. Who hasn't?
- l ran into him at a party

906
01:20:12,127 --> 01:20:14,925
''He had the album,
luckily l got it too''

907
01:20:16,047 --> 01:20:18,038
l'll have a copy of it
sent to you

908
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:23,122
''We're both R.D. fans, right?
We're going to get along fine''

909
01:20:24,007 --> 01:20:25,998
Sure. l'll come in a moment

910
01:20:37,127 --> 01:20:40,119
l forgot to touch your feet.
- Where's the need to do this?

911
01:20:40,927 --> 01:20:44,124
''lt's your first visit here...
- No, you needn't do this''

912
01:20:44,727 --> 01:20:47,605
''We'll be friends, not
mother-in-law and daughter-in-law''

913
01:20:48,007 --> 01:20:49,918
''Friends?
- Yes, friends''

914
01:20:50,127 --> 01:20:52,118
l didn't attend your wedding.
Did you feel bad?

915
01:20:52,327 --> 01:20:54,318
No.
- l wanted to attend

916
01:20:54,527 --> 01:20:57,519
And why not? lt was my
only son's wedding

917
01:20:58,127 --> 01:21:02,120
''Just as you obey your husband, l
have to accept my husband's decisions''

918
01:21:02,647 --> 01:21:05,115
Even if it's a very
stupid decision

919
01:21:05,647 --> 01:21:08,844
''l can understand, Mrs Rana...
what may l call you?''

920
01:21:09,367 --> 01:21:11,358
Call me what Amar calls me

921
01:21:13,007 --> 01:21:14,998
Amar calls me Ma

922
01:21:15,927 --> 01:21:18,441
''All right, Ma.
- Where is he?''

923
01:21:20,647 --> 01:21:26,404
Amar has gone to the flour mill.
- Amar? The flour mill

924
01:21:27,127 --> 01:21:29,436
His daddy would never do
something like this

925
01:21:30,127 --> 01:21:32,641
''Actually, l was busy with
the chores and he...''

926
01:21:32,927 --> 01:21:37,125
That's all right. l hope you will
make him do all these things

927
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:41,118
l forgot to offer you something.
What will you have? Tea...?

928
01:21:41,367 --> 01:21:43,119
lt's okay. l've just had tea

929
01:21:43,247 --> 01:21:45,681
''No, it's your first visit.
l won't take much time''

930
01:21:46,127 --> 01:21:49,119
Know what? The father and son
are so much like each other

931
01:21:50,127 --> 01:21:52,118
Very stubborn.
- Yes

932
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:54,835
The two of us must
bring them together

933
01:21:54,967 --> 01:21:56,958
We must put together
our scattered family

934
01:21:57,127 --> 01:21:58,924
That's what l want too

935
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:01,925
That's because you and l love
the same boy

936
01:22:03,927 --> 01:22:06,919
This Sunday is Amar's daddy's
sixtieth birthday

937
01:22:08,047 --> 01:22:10,515
l want the two of you to attend

938
01:22:11,607 --> 01:22:14,121
He misses his son very much too

939
01:22:14,807 --> 01:22:17,799
This is the opportunity
to bring them back together

940
01:22:18,207 --> 01:22:20,721
''You will come, won't you?''

941
01:22:22,967 --> 01:22:25,322
We'll do our best to attend.
- Really?

942
01:22:25,927 --> 01:22:30,523
''l promise, we will attend.
l want them to get together again''

943
01:22:32,807 --> 01:22:35,526
l could gift you nothing
during your wedding

944
01:22:36,967 --> 01:22:40,801
l wanted to give you this necklace.
My mother gave it to me at my wedding

945
01:22:41,127 --> 01:22:43,846
l kept it carefully
for my daughter-in-law

946
01:22:44,207 --> 01:22:48,519
''l don't have a daughter, you see.
- And l don't have a mother''

947
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:52,523
You have both now.
A mother and a friend

948
01:23:05,887 --> 01:23:08,117
l'll preserve it all my life

949
01:23:08,927 --> 01:23:10,918
Come to me

950
01:23:17,127 --> 01:23:19,925
l'm so happy you came here.
- l must leave now

951
01:23:20,647 --> 01:23:23,115
''Wait, Amar will be back soon.
- No''

952
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:27,966
l'd rather you have a word with him.
The two of us love him very much

953
01:23:29,127 --> 01:23:32,119
''You will come, won't you?
- l promise...''

954
01:23:32,527 --> 01:23:35,121
Amar and l will be there
next Sunday

955
01:23:43,847 --> 01:23:46,964
''lf there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to tell me, okay?''

956
01:23:47,207 --> 01:23:49,596
''Sure, Mrs Rana...
l mean, Ma''

957
01:23:51,047 --> 01:23:54,119
''And l'll keep that R.D. Burman
album ready for you, okay?''

958
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:08,126
So what have you thought of doing?
- l don't want to think about it at all

959
01:24:08,847 --> 01:24:12,522
''You want them to come to your
house on their knees, Amar?''

960
01:24:15,127 --> 01:24:17,721
They're trying to reach out to you.
- Bullshit

961
01:24:18,127 --> 01:24:21,119
''My Ma came here, not my father.
- Try and understand, Amar''

962
01:24:21,487 --> 01:24:24,604
They're both sixty. Don't be too
late in a compromise...

963
01:24:24,927 --> 01:24:27,919
lest they are no longer alive!
When Amar Jr insults you one day...

964
01:24:28,207 --> 01:24:32,120
He's not going to be called Amar Jr.
- Whatever his name...

965
01:24:32,727 --> 01:24:34,922
he'll go away some day to
establish his own identity...

966
01:24:35,127 --> 01:24:37,846
He'll never be angry with me.
- How can you be so sure?

967
01:24:38,127 --> 01:24:41,119
Because l'll give him a lot of love.
- Like you will love your son...

968
01:24:41,447 --> 01:24:45,838
''your daddy loves you too, Amar.
Maybe he has his own way of loving''

969
01:24:46,127 --> 01:24:49,119
Maybe your son will not like
your way of loving him too

970
01:24:49,527 --> 01:24:51,802
There's so much of arrogance
in the Ranawat family!

971
01:24:52,007 --> 01:24:53,998
You treat your loved ones
like your competitors!

972
01:24:54,167 --> 01:24:57,318
You don't even understand their love
and call it hatred instead?

973
01:24:57,607 --> 01:24:59,598
l'd have relented if that
hatred was not directed at you

974
01:24:59,927 --> 01:25:01,918
But there's no chance now.
- What will l tell Ma?

975
01:25:02,127 --> 01:25:04,118
l've given her a promise!
- Whom did you ask before you promised?

976
01:25:04,367 --> 01:25:06,358
l can't understand how l married
a stubborn man like you!

977
01:25:06,487 --> 01:25:09,126
l told you beforehand not to
interfere in my family matters

978
01:25:09,367 --> 01:25:12,439
lt is now my family too!
- Whom did you ask ?

979
01:25:12,927 --> 01:25:15,919
l am your wife!
- That gives you no right to...

980
01:25:16,127 --> 01:25:17,924
Right...? Amar!

981
01:25:21,127 --> 01:25:24,119
l don't want to say
anything more in this regard

982
01:25:24,607 --> 01:25:27,838
ls that your order?
- Call it what you like

983
01:25:29,967 --> 01:25:33,118
We must at least telephone and
tell them that we're not coming

984
01:25:33,607 --> 01:25:36,804
''l must've lied in my life,
even made mistakes...''

985
01:25:37,207 --> 01:25:42,122
but l've never knowingly
hurt anyone ever and never will

986
01:25:42,527 --> 01:25:46,122
Do what you will.
- What's their number?

987
01:25:47,007 --> 01:25:50,124
Send them a note instead.
- Don't try my patience!

988
01:25:50,527 --> 01:25:53,917
What is their number?
- lt's in the phone book

989
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:07,916
''Sir, this is Lekha...''

990
01:26:09,847 --> 01:26:11,838
''Must we refuse, Amar?''

991
01:26:14,927 --> 01:26:16,645
Please forgive us

992
01:26:17,207 --> 01:26:19,721
''Actually, Amar's exams
are round the corner''

993
01:26:19,927 --> 01:26:21,918
We will not be able to come

994
01:26:22,207 --> 01:26:24,118
That's all right

995
01:26:25,127 --> 01:26:28,722
''He sounds very sad, Amar. Will you
continue to rub salt in his wounds?''

996
01:26:29,207 --> 01:26:32,836
At least say hello to him. Please!
- l'll never talk to him. Never

997
01:26:34,207 --> 01:26:36,641
''l've never ever asked you
for anything, Amar''

998
01:26:36,927 --> 01:26:39,521
''For my sake, Amar... please!
- No''

999
01:26:40,127 --> 01:26:42,118
You're a wicked man!

1000
01:26:43,847 --> 01:26:46,122
''Sorry, sir. There was
a disturbance in the line''

1001
01:26:46,927 --> 01:26:49,316
And there's something
l want to tell you

1002
01:26:50,327 --> 01:26:54,605
''Amar misses you very much, sir.
He loves you very much''

1003
01:26:55,167 --> 01:26:58,523
''He doesn't want you to get to know,
how much he loves you''

1004
01:26:59,127 --> 01:27:01,925
''His way of loving...
- That's enough, Lekha!''

1005
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:11,141
l've been waiting here since
seven hours. l had forgotten the keys

1006
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:14,742
l'm... forgive me

1007
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,742
You don't apologise
to the one you love

1008
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:53,145
We're celebrating
our first festival of Diwali

1009
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:56,749
''Careful, Lekha''

1010
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:04,744
''Madam, your mother sends this for you''

1011
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:08,421
What is it?
- Ma sends me a Diwali gift

1012
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:11,747
A special R D Burman's
collection of Bengali songs

1013
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:15,661
''You mean, your Ma...?
- Your Ma is my Ma too''

1014
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:18,469
Let me...
- You don't need to know

1015
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:21,549
''Ulhas, see what Ma sends me''

1016
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,547
''Come on, come here''

1017
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:13,742
''Look, she is going.
- l told you, she will''

1018
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:17,742
Uncle is here to see her.
- What's this?

1019
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:19,981
lt's fashion. What do you want?
- You

1020
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:24,749
''l'm working, go away.
- Quit the job''

1021
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:30,145
Really? Then who will feed us?
- l need to say something. Come on

1022
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:32,268
Now?
- Right now

1023
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:35,223
''Don't be kiddish. Wait for me outside,
l'll come when l'm through''

1024
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,741
Come soon.
- Perseverance pays

1025
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:50,379
''Now would you tell me, Moneybags?
- l want to tell you something''

1026
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:53,218
''You could've told me back there.
- No, l want to say it here''

1027
01:32:53,550 --> 01:32:55,541
''Why?
- Here, l fell in love with you...''

1028
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,661
''l kissed you for the first time, and...
- And what, Moneybags?''

1029
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:01,545
''Here, l proposed marriage to you.
- Which means the results are out''

1030
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:04,549
And you have come out triumphs.
- lt's something better than that

1031
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:07,549
''You came first in class.
- No, third''

1032
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:12,348
''Big deal, eh?
- lt's no joke, Lekha''

1033
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:15,139
''l will get a job soon.
- Third, eh?''

1034
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:19,548
''Say something, Lekha.
- l won't say anything...''

1035
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:22,742
till l meet the boys
who came first and second

1036
01:33:27,230 --> 01:33:29,949
''Now find a job at the soonest,
so that l can get some rest''

1037
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:34,345
l know few companies' directors.
- Whether you like it or not...

1038
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:37,469
''but Moneybags, your Daddy's name and
acquaintances are helping you out''

1039
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:39,467
''Not his name, but surname''

1040
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:41,422
''Your Daddy's.
- No, my grandpa's''

1041
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:43,541
''No matter what you say, Moneybags
your daddy helped you finally''

1042
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:53,629
''Thanks to you, l have found so much.
- Lie. Absolute lie''

1043
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:56,743
''Lie?
- Not so much, but everything''

1044
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:07,748
''Ma was very happy to hear about it,
Amar. She sponsors tonight's treat''

1045
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:12,463
She asked me what you like.
l told her that like his daddy...

1046
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:16,220
my Moneybags likes fancy drink
and stylish dinner

1047
01:34:16,830 --> 01:34:18,946
Tonight's treat is in honour of Ma

1048
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:21,580
''l don't want it.
- Look Moneybags, if you want to...''

1049
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:25,743
''quit this lovely dinner, you may.
l'd rather hog on it''

1050
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:29,739
''l'll pack the rest, take it home,
and eat it for tomorrow's lunch''

1051
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:37,184
''The dinner is from Ma, not Dad''

1052
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:42,744
''Tell me, who stood first in class?
- A girl from Goa. Nancy D'costa''

1053
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:45,744
''l congratulated her,
and she gave me a hug''

1054
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:52,302
Are you jealous?
- ls her figure better than mine?

1055
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:57,746
You got any idea about stock exchange?
- Can she cook mutton biryani?

1056
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:02,746
Yes. She had brought it the other day.
Everyone compared it with her figure

1057
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:09,746
l can bet on it.
- Finally you give up

1058
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:14,144
Does she pay your rent?

1059
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:19,265
''Answer me.
- When l'm winning, l can spare you''

1060
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:21,740
''You never win, Moneybags''

1061
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:52,218
So this is our last trip.
l hate moving

1062
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:56,743
''So you want to go back to the chawl?
- No way. l said, l hate moving''

1063
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:02,223
The shifting has really exhausted us.
- l'm going to sleep in an a/c room!

1064
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:04,941
What happened?
- Aren't you forgetting something?

1065
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:06,742
What?
- Forgot?

1066
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:13,139
You're going to
make a donkey out of me

1067
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:17,549
Now?
- Yes

1068
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:21,139
Why didn't you tell me before?

1069
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:25,218
Don't change your mind
once we get upstairs

1070
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:34,982
Moneybags! Our apartment! Our house!

1071
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:44,263
lf l were to work
and lead a life like that...

1072
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:47,867
l'd soon divorce you. But from now on
l'm going to sleep till eleven

1073
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:50,221
l'll employ servants

1074
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:55,384
l'll use your money
to shop in London and Paris

1075
01:36:56,670 --> 01:37:00,549
''What about your classical music?
- Later. As of now, l'll enjoy''

1076
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:03,742
''l'll rest.
- Of course, my love''

1077
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:23,539
l got to work tonight
for tomorrow's project

1078
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:38,140
''What is the matter?
- We hardly talk anymore, Amar''

1079
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:42,743
What do you mean? Aren't we talking?
- That's not what l meant

1080
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:49,586
''After breakfast you rush to work,
and l go to the music class''

1081
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:55,380
''ln the evening, you come home tired,
we have dinner, a little chat...''

1082
01:37:55,830 --> 01:38:00,142
''watch tv, and then we go
to the bedroom, only to sleep''

1083
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:05,299
''l can't help it. l got work.
- l'm not complaining, Amar''

1084
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:10,062
Try to understand.
Our life is no more the same

1085
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:12,581
''We don't go out anymore,
we don't enjoy anymore''

1086
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:18,183
''All we get is a Sunday, that you
spend watching cricket or car race''

1087
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:22,030
''Though involuntarily, but we're
going far away from each other''

1088
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:28,144
What are you getting at?
- We need to talk and think

1089
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:32,538
''The romance, the love,
those sweet tiffs...''

1090
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:34,741
''those squabbles and quarrels,
the appeasing...''

1091
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:36,901
where have they disappeared?

1092
01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:40,144
Did we marry just to live
in this routine?

1093
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:43,748
''Does every married couple
go through this phase, Amar?''

1094
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:47,421
l don't know what to say

1095
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:51,379
''Believe me, l love you just as much
as l loved you before we married''

1096
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:58,385
Even l love you as much. That's why
probably l'm discussing this with you

1097
01:38:58,750 --> 01:39:04,746
''Unlike others', l don't want our lives
to get so empty, dull and boring...''

1098
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:07,745
and make this kind of life
a lifestyle...

1099
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:10,744
or find the lost love
in someone else

1100
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:16,463
''You think l'm having an affair?
- No, no Amar. Don't misunderstand me''

1101
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:19,742
l'm not thinking anything like that.
Please try to understand me

1102
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:24,540
What am l supposed to do? Tell me.
lf l'm to quit this job...

1103
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:27,469
''and take up another, l'll have
to put in the same efforts''

1104
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:30,742
''l'll have to devote most of my time
there, whether l like it or not''

1105
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:35,059
What do you want from me?

1106
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:39,743
''You can't give me
what l want, Moneybags''

1107
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:43,301
l need your time

1108
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:48,469
l know it is very difficult
for you now

1109
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:52,226
''But l want to bring back that
lost spell, Amar. What am l to do?''

1110
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:58,427
''l'll tell you. Reminisce our college
days, our friends, our discussions''

1111
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:02,139
Let's have social life.
Maybe that will make a difference

1112
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:08,182
l miss my friends. Maybe
that's why l feel lonely at times

1113
01:40:13,310 --> 01:40:16,222
All right. Great idea.
l'll call up everyone

1114
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:18,581
That's like it

1115
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:17,065
''Come on, dance''

1116
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:21,060
''Come on, move it''

1117
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:25,265
''What have you lost?
What have you gained?''

1118
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:29,299
''Nothing will remain with you,
for, you brought nothing with you''

1119
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:32,742
''Listen to what l say, friends''

1120
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:39,743
''So come on, dance''

1121
01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:43,745
''Come on, move it''

1122
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:21,379
''Tonight, joys have
spread their colours...''

1123
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:25,061
making our hearts hysteric

1124
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:29,299
''Life belongs to the one
who smiles his way out''

1125
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:33,345
''He's a true friend,
who'd die for friendship's sake''

1126
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:39,461
''Never stay aloof.
Preach what l have said''

1127
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:43,747
''Come on, dance''

1128
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:48,223
''Come on, move it''

1129
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:21,140
''Youth brings along with it
so many dreams''

1130
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:25,265
''So what if dreams shatter?
Go ahead and dream''

1131
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:29,425
Find a lover for yourself

1132
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:35,302
''Present is what you have, everything
else is only a dream, says my heart''

1133
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:39,738
''So come on, dance''

1134
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:43,745
''Come on, move it''

1135
01:43:44,390 --> 01:43:48,269
''What have you lost?
What have you gained?''

1136
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:52,220
''Nothing will remain with you,
for, you brought nothing with you''

1137
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:55,747
''Heed me, friends''

1138
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:02,743
''Come on, dance''

1139
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:06,939
''Come on, move it''

1140
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:09,148
Dance

1141
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:16,065
''Amar, l don't think this idea
is going to work anymore''

1142
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,468
True

1143
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:22,024
''Someone is not free on the
next weekend, someone is busy...''

1144
01:44:22,150 --> 01:44:26,621
for the next three weekends.
- That leaves the both of us

1145
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:30,310
Only you and l

1146
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:36,144
''But Amar, there are married couples
who live so happily''

1147
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:42,263
''We must find a way out. l think,
the ways of entertainment...''

1148
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:45,223
for successful married couple
are entirely different

1149
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:49,060
''They probably celebrate their joys
with families, instead of friends''

1150
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:54,460
''But family means, husband, wife and...
- And children''

1151
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:58,742
l think they probably find
their happiness in their children

1152
01:45:00,350 --> 01:45:02,068
Nice scheme

1153
01:45:02,590 --> 01:45:04,945
''Scheme?
- Yes, the baby scheme''

1154
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:08,390
So you want a baby?
- What about you?

1155
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:13,744
''lf you want it, l have no problems.
- So why delay a good deed, Moneybags?''

1156
01:45:17,910 --> 01:45:19,741
What if we get twins?

1157
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:42,150
''l wanted to get rid of this
long back, Amar''

1158
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:01,264
l need to talk to you.
- Anything special?

1159
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:06,426
''Lekha... and l too,
we want a baby''

1160
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:10,299
Any problem?
- No problem. We want a baby...

1161
01:46:10,590 --> 01:46:14,583
and we've been trying.
- Trying since when?

1162
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:19,742
Remember we had a party at my house?
- Six months back

1163
01:46:20,430 --> 01:46:23,149
That's too long.
Do something productive

1164
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:30,745
''Few months after marriage,
life becomes kind of routine''

1165
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:35,742
''Yes, and only thing comes to mind.
lnvite college friends over''

1166
01:46:36,430 --> 01:46:41,743
''Party, fun... and after they leave,
the same old solitude again. Boring''

1167
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:45,548
Then what's the solution?
A baby?

1168
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:48,139
Nothing of that sort

1169
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:52,423
''Don't worry, buddy.
Everyone goes through this phase''

1170
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:56,538
''lf you think a baby is the solution
to your problem, you are wrong''

1171
01:46:57,670 --> 01:47:00,901
''Life would get even worse, silly.
The baby will keep wailing...''

1172
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:04,142
''all through the night,
won't let you sleep in peace either''

1173
01:47:04,990 --> 01:47:08,983
''Forget the nights, he won't even
let you rest during daytime''

1174
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:12,148
His little ailments
could give you a heart attack

1175
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:15,229
''No, it's not so bad.
What are you talking?''

1176
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:17,541
''Not just bad, friend, it's real bad''

1177
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:20,469
The two of you won't get time
for yourselves

1178
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:23,059
The baby will be with you
all the while

1179
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:29,063
Then you will wait till he grows up
so that you find time for her

1180
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:34,221
''But no. His schooling, college,
his wedding, his children...!''

1181
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:39,346
''ln the mess, you won't know
when you grew old''

1182
01:47:39,950 --> 01:47:42,544
And when you calculate you will
know that your entire earnings...

1183
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:45,742
have gone towards his
rearing and schooling. And then...

1184
01:47:46,230 --> 01:47:50,985
''he will enjoy his life. And then
old man, you and your wife...''

1185
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:55,383
will finally find privacy.
- You were a kid too. You're joking

1186
01:47:55,750 --> 01:48:02,223
''l'm telling you the fact. lf you don't
believe me, ask the married ones''

1187
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:06,743
''lt's a waste. Love, sex and
everything is just temporary''

1188
01:48:07,150 --> 01:48:11,302
Are you solving my problem? Or are
you asking me to divorce my wife?

1189
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:17,747
My word. lf you want to sacrifice
for the sake of your child's future...

1190
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:20,738
''well, go ahead and have a baby''

1191
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:24,264
l forgot my underwear.
- As usual

1192
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:27,742
''Hurry, it's time for the race. 9.30.
- Really?''

1193
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:33,539
You are right in a way.
- As far as your wife's pregnancy...

1194
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:36,423
''is concerned,
l'll tell you what l have heard''

1195
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:38,741
What?
- Try and try till you succeed

1196
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:43,148
Must keep trying.
Someday success will come kissing

1197
01:48:43,630 --> 01:48:46,622
''Try, eh? How much?
All day, all night''

1198
01:48:48,590 --> 01:48:51,741
''Well, then you got to meet
a specialist. He might help you''

1199
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:54,948
''Why? Could there be a defect,
a problem?''

1200
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:58,742
''lt's not about defects,
but just consult a doctor''

1201
01:48:59,750 --> 01:49:01,069
All right

1202
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:04,741
You haven't returned my CD yet

1203
01:49:05,150 --> 01:49:06,742
Which one.
- Gypsy King

1204
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:09,339
l have returned it.
- lt's been two years now

1205
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:14,742
''Amar, l never imagined
it could happen to us''

1206
01:49:16,230 --> 01:49:19,461
''To avoid a baby,
we practiced family planning''

1207
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:24,384
''And now that we need a baby,
nature refuses us''

1208
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:27,060
Let me tune in to FM

1209
01:49:28,830 --> 01:49:32,823
''How were we to know? Like the
doctor said, it's a problem...''

1210
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:37,746
with forty percent of the couples.
- But l could never imagine...

1211
01:49:38,150 --> 01:49:42,029
that we'd be one of them.
- Why feel remorse?

1212
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:44,501
''There are other alternatives.
Test-tube, artificial insemination...''

1213
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:49,743
''lf that too fails, we can adopt.
- What are you talking, Amar?''

1214
01:49:53,070 --> 01:49:55,743
We won't talk about it
till the reports arrive

1215
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:09,145
''l'm just worried that l might
have a defect, that l may be flawed''

1216
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:11,627
What do you mean?

1217
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:16,742
''You mean, it's okay if you're flawed?
You expect me to be flawed, eh?''

1218
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:20,222
''l didn't mean that...
- Amar, that's just what you meant''

1219
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:24,743
l didn't mean that...
- l know well what you mean

1220
01:50:25,550 --> 01:50:29,225
lt doesn't matter to you if the fault
lies in you. But if you're flawed...

1221
01:50:29,550 --> 01:50:33,543
your masculinity is under threat.
lt is challenged

1222
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:38,746
''You are wrong, Lekha.
- l'm wrong, eh? And you are right?''

1223
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:45,983
''All right, l admit l'm wrong.
l'm an ass, l'm insensitive''

1224
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:53,744
Happiness has flown
miles away from me

1225
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:08,028
Look Lekha... l love you.
l'd never want that you be flawed

1226
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:11,661
''Calm down, Lekha''

1227
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:17,745
''Forget it now, and let's wait
for the reports to come in''

1228
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:20,024
All right

1229
01:51:21,590 --> 01:51:27,267
''l mustn't drag the matter too far.
- Let's put it behind us, and...''

1230
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:31,425
let's go watch a movie.
Coming?

1231
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:52,141
''So who is at fault, doctor?
- Can't call it a fault or a mistake''

1232
01:51:59,110 --> 01:52:02,739
What's the alternative? Test-tube
baby? Artificial insemination?

1233
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:05,618
''No, no.
- Or do we adopt a child?''

1234
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:08,741
Look Mr Ranawat...

1235
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:18,749
lt's more serious than you imagine

1236
01:52:24,990 --> 01:52:31,145
''Be explicit, doctor.
- She's going to die... soon''

1237
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:35,140
''lt cannot be, doctor.
- lt's true''

1238
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:39,743
Did you check properly?
There could be a mistake

1239
01:52:40,150 --> 01:52:45,065
''No mistake, friend. Thrice we tested
the blood. Got specialists to check''

1240
01:52:45,630 --> 01:52:48,747
''Besides, the Tata Cancer
Research Centre's reports are in too''

1241
01:52:49,230 --> 01:52:51,744
That's why it took so long

1242
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:55,222
lt was a conclusion arrived upon
after much consideration

1243
01:53:04,830 --> 01:53:08,379
What is wrong with her?
- Leukemia

1244
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:30,063
''What do l do?
Doctor, l can do anything for her''

1245
01:53:30,830 --> 01:53:33,742
''Neither you nor we can do anything,
Mr Ranawat''

1246
01:53:35,830 --> 01:53:39,140
Just pray that...
- What do l tell Lekha?

1247
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:42,461
She had called up

1248
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:50,747
''l told that the two of you are fine,
and that it's just a matter of time''

1249
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:55,581
''You mean l mustn't tell her?
- As you wish, Mr Ranawat''

1250
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:02,342
You mean...

1251
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:13,741
''l'd say Mr Ranawat, in front of her
behave as if nothing is wrong''

1252
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:18,743
Stay normal yourself.
- Normal?

1253
01:54:21,670 --> 01:54:25,299
''All right, l'll stay normal for her''

1254
01:55:50,830 --> 01:55:53,549
You took so long. You said we'd
celebrate after the reports arrive

1255
01:55:53,950 --> 01:55:57,147
The reports say everything is fine.
Let's have a party

1256
01:55:57,830 --> 01:56:01,459
Come on! What are you doing? Hurry up.
Everyone has seen Lagaan except us

1257
01:56:01,750 --> 01:56:04,548
l'm not hungry.
- lt's already 9:10. The show...

1258
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:07,218
''is at 9:30. Have your dinner,
l've already eaten''

1259
01:56:07,550 --> 01:56:10,223
l'm not hungry.
- You aren't hungry?

1260
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:13,548
''My baby elephant, hope you're well?
- l'd rather eat''

1261
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:18,460
''Forget it, eat after the movie.
- We won't get tickets, we're late''

1262
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:21,742
l hate to miss the beginning.
We'll buy tickets in the blackmarket

1263
01:57:06,070 --> 01:57:08,061
Ulhas?
- Yes

1264
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:13,538
Amar here.
- Hey Amar! After so long?

1265
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:19,741
''You almost forgot me. Busy, eh?
- l'm coming over tomorrow''

1266
01:57:20,110 --> 01:57:25,343
''l'll cook chicken for you,
and rig the bathroom as well''

1267
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:28,548
''No Ulhas, l...
- l haven't met you couple since long''

1268
01:57:29,870 --> 01:57:33,146
l'm coming alone.
- Have the two of your quarreled?

1269
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:36,542
lt happens between husbands and wives.
l and my wife constantly...

1270
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:41,585
''Nothing of that sort, Ulhas.
- Then what is it? Short of cash?''

1271
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:45,745
''Don't worry, l have saved some.
l'll give it to you''

1272
01:57:46,270 --> 01:57:51,549
Don't tell Lekha about it.
- Bye Ulhas. l'll come over

1273
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:07,538
Like to eat something?
- No

1274
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:13,548
l cooked chicken. Want it?

1275
01:58:16,270 --> 01:58:18,261
l'm not hungry

1276
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:22,059
l'm not hungry either

1277
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:27,141
''l'm not hungry either, buddy''

1278
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:42,547
''Enough, Ulhas''

1279
01:58:56,790 --> 01:59:00,226
''We ought to be brave, Ulhas.
We must not let her know''

1280
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:05,068
She'd never know about it from me.
- Bye Ulhas

1281
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:10,380
lnform me if you need me.
l'll come over somehow

1282
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:14,062
''Sure Ulhas, l will''

1283
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:10,426
''Why did you keep me alive
to see this day, Lord?''

1284
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:13,219
Why Lord?

1285
02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:19,344
''lf l've sinned, punish me Lord.
But do not punish my child''

1286
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:22,742
''Don't take her away from me, Lord!''

1287
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:28,298
''Don't take her away from me!
How could You do this, Lord?''

1288
02:00:29,150 --> 02:00:35,146
''How could You do this? Don't
take my child away from me, Lord!''

1289
02:00:35,790 --> 02:00:38,748
''Don't take her away from me, Lord!''

1290
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:52,349
Come Amar

1291
02:00:56,670 --> 02:01:01,061
''ls all well?
- Sir, l need some money on loan''

1292
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:07,586
''May l know why?
- l... l can't tell you, sir''

1293
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:13,744
Just give me a loan.
- Doesn't your company pay you well?

1294
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:18,938
And that girl
doesn't teach music anymore?

1295
02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:22,662
She has a name. Lekha.
- Oh yes. Lekha

1296
02:01:23,830 --> 02:01:27,743
''Doesn't Lekha teach music anymore?
- Sir, don't drag Lekha in between''

1297
02:01:29,270 --> 02:01:34,663
lt's my personal matter.
- Which means...

1298
02:01:35,190 --> 02:01:39,468
''you've put someone in trouble,
and you don't want Lekha to know''

1299
02:01:39,830 --> 02:01:44,426
''You may consider that, sir.
Please give me money''

1300
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:49,743
''How much do you want?
- 500,000''

1301
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:37,742
Let me see this episode.
- Forget the tv. l've got news

1302
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:40,624
''Moneybags, switch on the tv please.
- We're going to London and Paris''

1303
02:02:40,870 --> 02:02:42,747
Ask me how?
- How?

1304
02:02:43,110 --> 02:02:47,183
''An aunt of mine passed away recently.
She left 500,000 for me''

1305
02:02:47,670 --> 02:02:50,343
l received the cheque today. So l
thought l'd make your dream come true

1306
02:02:54,750 --> 02:02:57,548
''Hang on, Moneybags.
We're not blowing it up''

1307
02:02:57,830 --> 02:03:01,220
We're not going to spend a penny.
We're going to save the money

1308
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:04,390
''Don't be a scrooge, Lekha. We won't
get another chance to live it up''

1309
02:03:04,590 --> 02:03:07,229
''l know, Moneybags.
- l mean...''

1310
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:10,747
''Look Amar, we've spent all the money
that you earned till date''

1311
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:16,543
Now l want our bank balance to grow.
We have to buy a house too

1312
02:03:17,230 --> 02:03:22,429
''Besides, l don't want to go to
London or Paris. All l want is you''

1313
02:03:22,750 --> 02:03:25,548
''And you have me, baby.
- l mean, l want your time''

1314
02:03:25,830 --> 02:03:28,424
You have that too.
- You mean you're sacked?

1315
02:03:28,630 --> 02:03:32,066
l apple-polished my boss
and got a month's leave

1316
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:37,743
Then we'll buy second class Konkan
Railway tickets and go to Kerala

1317
02:03:38,150 --> 02:03:41,460
Kerala?
- Yes. l've seen it in the NGC

1318
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:44,543
''lt's a lovely place.
- You want to go to Madras, not Paris?''

1319
02:03:44,830 --> 02:03:48,061
''Not Madras, Kerala, stupid.
They speak Malayalam''

1320
02:03:49,830 --> 02:03:52,549
''For me, they are all Madrasis.
lf that is God's own country...''

1321
02:03:52,750 --> 02:03:56,140
is Paris devil's country?
- Even people from London and Paris...

1322
02:03:56,270 --> 02:04:01,139
go for vacation in Kerala.
- Okay! We'll go wherever you want

1323
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:03,421
No matter if l have to eat
ldlis and Dosas everyday

1324
02:04:03,630 --> 02:04:07,669
''You're so sweet, Moneybags.
You look sweet when you obey me''

1325
02:04:08,670 --> 02:04:10,740
Do l have a choice?
- No

1326
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:56,222
''My love,
ever since l found you...''

1327
02:04:58,550 --> 02:05:04,147
love taught me to live

1328
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:08,061
Love taught me to live

1329
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:13,426
You beat in my heart as heartbeats

1330
02:05:13,870 --> 02:05:20,139
''My heart says,
you are my love''

1331
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:24,184
You are my love

1332
02:06:09,310 --> 02:06:14,225
l shall you hold in my eyes

1333
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:22,222
''Come,
let me embrace you''

1334
02:06:39,830 --> 02:06:46,747
After l come around

1335
02:06:47,950 --> 02:06:53,547
''Don't let this high
come to pass''

1336
02:06:54,550 --> 02:07:00,147
''Wonder what this high
will lead to''

1337
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:08,222
''My love,
ever since l found you...''

1338
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:15,748
love taught me to live

1339
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:20,146
Love taught me to live

1340
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:05,347
''Now that you found me,
don't lose me''

1341
02:08:07,670 --> 02:08:13,142
''Now that you have me,
don't ever part''

1342
02:08:30,830 --> 02:08:37,144
No one knows what destiny wills

1343
02:08:38,750 --> 02:08:44,063
''Always be with me,
my love''

1344
02:08:45,590 --> 02:08:51,540
''l can't live
if living is without you''

1345
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:59,218
''My love,
ever since l found you...''

1346
02:09:00,750 --> 02:09:06,461
love taught me to live

1347
02:09:07,310 --> 02:09:10,461
Love taught me to live

1348
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:15,740
You beat in my heart as heartbeats

1349
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:22,738
''My heart says,
you are my love''

1350
02:09:23,750 --> 02:09:26,218
You are my love

1351
02:09:42,270 --> 02:09:44,943
Does it rain in London and Paris?
- We can go shopping there

1352
02:09:45,150 --> 02:09:47,425
Hold the umbrella. My dress...
- Sure

1353
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:16,742
''Are you okay, my love?
- l'm feeling dizzy''

1354
02:10:18,230 --> 02:10:20,744
lt could be due to the long hours
of travelling and the weather

1355
02:10:21,150 --> 02:10:23,459
l'll get some soup for you

1356
02:10:24,630 --> 02:10:27,224
No Moneybags... wait

1357
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:32,225
''What is it, my love?
- l just want to keep looking at you''

1358
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:35,744
So... keep watching

1359
02:10:37,550 --> 02:10:40,906
''Moneybags, l want you
to be happy, always''

1360
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:47,062
''l'm happy, my love.
- l mean...''

1361
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:50,742
stay happy
even after l'm gone

1362
02:10:55,630 --> 02:11:00,750
l had been to another doctor
with my friend a few days ago

1363
02:11:01,870 --> 02:11:04,145
Then l called up doctor Medora

1364
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:08,621
''On much insistence,
he told me the truth''

1365
02:11:09,150 --> 02:11:13,746
l made him promise that he won't
tell you anything about it

1366
02:11:16,590 --> 02:11:20,469
''Since when have you known it...?
- Ever since you knew it, Amar''

1367
02:11:22,830 --> 02:11:25,742
So you were putting
on an act till now?

1368
02:11:26,230 --> 02:11:32,749
''No, not like you.
l was living up every moment of life''

1369
02:11:34,230 --> 02:11:39,350
''But l must admit, Moneybags, the
moments that l passed with you...''

1370
02:11:39,750 --> 02:11:42,742
were the most beautiful moments
of my life

1371
02:11:44,270 --> 02:11:47,068
And l know where
you got the money from

1372
02:11:47,630 --> 02:11:52,146
''Ma told me, you were in some kind of
trouble so you borrowed from daddy''

1373
02:11:56,150 --> 02:11:59,142
''What do l do, Lekha?
- Amar, don't''

1374
02:11:59,870 --> 02:12:04,466
''Oh, what do l do, Lekha?''

1375
02:12:07,750 --> 02:12:11,379
''l'm sure, Moneybags,
you won't lose courage''

1376
02:12:14,950 --> 02:12:17,748
''Amar, don't.
- No, l won't lose courage''

1377
02:12:18,630 --> 02:12:21,383
''l won't lose courage.
- Look at me, Amar''

1378
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:25,743
''Not for yourself, but you'll have
to be brave for the sake of Ulhas''

1379
02:12:26,750 --> 02:12:29,742
Because this is going to be
a grave shock for him

1380
02:12:30,830 --> 02:12:35,142
''As for you, you will become
a lucky bachelor''

1381
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:41,748
''l can never be happy, Lekha.
Oh, never!''

1382
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:52,540
''You will have to be happy, Amar.
l want you to be cheerful. Fine?''

1383
02:12:55,270 --> 02:12:58,546
l told you everything because
the doctor had told me that...

1384
02:12:58,830 --> 02:13:03,346
''when l start fainting,
l'll have to be probably hospitalised''

1385
02:13:03,830 --> 02:13:08,745
So l thought it is important for you
to know that l'm aware of everything

1386
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:11,342
Am l right?

1387
02:13:16,110 --> 02:13:20,547
''lt is written in the Holy Book that,
one who is born will certainly die''

1388
02:13:21,150 --> 02:13:26,224
Reincarnation is certain too.
So do not grieve over certainties

1389
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:31,459
l don't want to hear a word.
- So cheer up for my sake

1390
02:13:31,830 --> 02:13:35,140
''Besides, l've always been a step
ahead of you. This time too...''

1391
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:39,138
l'll wait for you in heaven.
l want to pester you there

1392
02:13:55,990 --> 02:13:59,141
''Moneybags, stay with me.
- l'll be right back''

1393
02:14:04,750 --> 02:14:06,706
You were saying something.
- Yes

1394
02:14:07,550 --> 02:14:09,541
''ls she sleeping?
- Yes, perhaps''

1395
02:14:09,830 --> 02:14:15,143
So is this our last hope?
- Yes. We tried all possible ways

1396
02:14:15,950 --> 02:14:18,339
We met all kinds of doctors
in the city

1397
02:14:23,750 --> 02:14:27,743
''Temples, mosques, churches... l have
prayed at every house of worship''

1398
02:14:29,750 --> 02:14:33,265
Ulhas even donated money
to every recluse

1399
02:14:35,830 --> 02:14:38,742
Don't lose hope.
Have faith in God

1400
02:14:40,590 --> 02:14:42,581
l was an atheist before

1401
02:14:44,150 --> 02:14:47,142
''But now, l'm not tired of
joining my hands to pray''

1402
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:52,902
All l pray for is
to see a ray of hope somewhere

1403
02:14:55,550 --> 02:14:58,144
The doctor who
is examining Lekha...

1404
02:15:00,830 --> 02:15:07,144
''Dr Vasuan Nair from Houston, is said
to be a specialist in leukemia''

1405
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:11,747
He has cured many
who had lost hope

1406
02:15:30,150 --> 02:15:34,143
Dr Nair will be here now. He has
studied the case. Please wait

1407
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:54,060
l got all the tests done again

1408
02:16:01,670 --> 02:16:05,743
l'm sorry to say that
we can't help it anymore

1409
02:16:14,750 --> 02:16:19,460
l have prescribed some medicines.
lt will alleviate her pain

1410
02:16:20,230 --> 02:16:24,428
''That would affect her memory,
but she will be relieved of the pain''

1411
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:42,659
''You seem sullen, Moneybags''

1412
02:16:45,830 --> 02:16:48,424
''Test results are negative, no?''

1413
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:51,978
Yes

1414
02:16:57,750 --> 02:17:01,379
''Lekha, l can't figure
what l'm supposed to do''

1415
02:17:02,350 --> 02:17:06,946
''Do nothing, Moneybags.
You have done all that is possible''

1416
02:17:08,750 --> 02:17:12,743
''Now, for my sake
get a hold on yourself. Come closer''

1417
02:17:14,830 --> 02:17:17,742
''Besides, it's not fair
if we both fall sick at the same time''

1418
02:17:21,270 --> 02:17:24,740
l feel l'll have
to be hospitalised soon

1419
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:31,578
''Moneybags, you look fatigued''

1420
02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:35,219
l want you to sleep for a while

1421
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:41,743
Take one pill.
lt'll put you to sleep soon

1422
02:18:18,990 --> 02:18:24,269
''An angel comes sneaking
in the night''

1423
02:18:25,430 --> 02:18:30,140
''An angel he is,
he brings moments of joys''

1424
02:18:31,390 --> 02:18:36,225
''He tells us to lose ourselves
in dream's embrace''

1425
02:18:37,150 --> 02:18:42,144
''Put your sorrows behind you
and go quietly to bed''

1426
02:18:45,830 --> 02:18:51,348
''l don't know when l fall asleep
after l close my eyes...''

1427
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:57,746
and l get lost in an alien land

1428
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:12,741
''ln my dreams,
l want only you for company''

1429
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:21,469
My arms...

1430
02:19:24,830 --> 02:19:27,469
l want only you to hold

1431
02:19:28,030 --> 02:19:33,741
''ln my dreams,
l want only you for company''

1432
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:08,543
Amidst melodious showers...

1433
02:20:13,510 --> 02:20:17,742
in the season of love...

1434
02:20:22,030 --> 02:20:27,229
we make love

1435
02:20:28,030 --> 02:20:33,150
''Days and nights turn around,
circumstances too''

1436
02:20:34,550 --> 02:20:39,340
''But every moment, constantly
we walk together''

1437
02:20:40,030 --> 02:20:45,582
''But one fine morning,
we will wake up to a broken dream''

1438
02:20:46,150 --> 02:20:51,543
Wonder why dreams shatter

1439
02:20:52,030 --> 02:20:57,388
''You shall be left alone,
so shall l be''

1440
02:20:57,990 --> 02:21:03,348
''Yet, not once, but
a hundred times l will say...''

1441
02:21:04,270 --> 02:21:09,742
''in my dreams
l want only your company''

1442
02:21:40,670 --> 02:21:44,743
ln unknown paths...

1443
02:21:46,550 --> 02:21:51,180
in life's embrace...

1444
02:21:52,390 --> 02:21:57,384
''at times we encounter joys,
at times, sorrows''

1445
02:21:58,070 --> 02:22:03,428
''Who has seen a tomorrow?
Who has known a tomorrow?''

1446
02:22:04,070 --> 02:22:09,463
Destiny is a way with everyone

1447
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:15,350
''Some of our desires
are fulfilled here''

1448
02:22:16,070 --> 02:22:21,463
''Some of our desires
remain unfulfilled''

1449
02:22:22,070 --> 02:22:27,383
But the journey of life continues

1450
02:22:27,950 --> 02:22:33,468
''And in every breath,
new hues continues to add''

1451
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:39,748
''ln my dreams
l want only your company''

1452
02:22:57,750 --> 02:23:01,538
''Moneybags, l'm not grieving
because l'm going to die''

1453
02:23:04,110 --> 02:23:09,548
But because you will be
left all alone

1454
02:23:16,990 --> 02:23:20,539
''Promise me, Ulhas.
Promise me''

1455
02:23:22,030 --> 02:23:24,339
''Yes my child, l promise you''

1456
02:23:26,310 --> 02:23:29,143
''l'm happy now.
- Yes, my child''

1457
02:23:30,550 --> 02:23:32,745
''Another thing, Ulhas...''

1458
02:23:36,590 --> 02:23:38,228
Come Amar

1459
02:23:38,710 --> 02:23:41,383
''No Moneybags,
please sit outside''

1460
02:23:42,310 --> 02:23:47,464
l'm in a meeting with Ulhas.
Khurzvekars are in a meeting

1461
02:23:47,750 --> 02:23:50,139
And Ranawats are not...
- All right

1462
02:23:51,230 --> 02:23:56,224
''Only those who can pronounce ''tz''
''can attend this meeting''

1463
02:23:56,750 --> 02:23:59,469
So only Maharashtrians
can sit here

1464
02:23:59,750 --> 02:24:02,742
''So my Rajasthani camel,
go and wait outside''

1465
02:24:03,310 --> 02:24:07,144
''All right, l don't fit in here.
l'll wait outside''

1466
02:24:07,750 --> 02:24:09,741
Don't go too far

1467
02:24:25,830 --> 02:24:29,140
''Go inside, she wants you.
l'll get myself a quarter of booze''

1468
02:24:35,310 --> 02:24:39,144
''Close the door, Moneybags,
and come to me''

1469
02:24:46,350 --> 02:24:47,749
Moneybags...

1470
02:24:49,550 --> 02:24:52,940
know what?
l was talking to my Ma now

1471
02:24:53,550 --> 02:24:58,749
''Ma?
- My new Mom, and your ex-Mom''

1472
02:24:59,310 --> 02:25:04,430
l see.
- l couldn't meet her this time

1473
02:25:05,310 --> 02:25:08,746
l had to offer an excuse again for not
keeping up with the monthly meeting

1474
02:25:09,550 --> 02:25:11,541
Monthly meeting?
- Yes

1475
02:25:11,870 --> 02:25:14,748
We used to meet once every month

1476
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:19,140
''Perhaps, l know her
better than you do''

1477
02:25:19,830 --> 02:25:24,745
She is so nice. You ought to
try to understand her

1478
02:25:25,190 --> 02:25:29,103
l will.
- Bid her farewell on my behalf

1479
02:25:30,550 --> 02:25:33,223
''And, give her
my music collection...''

1480
02:25:33,870 --> 02:25:38,739
along with the autographed
photograph of R D Burman

1481
02:25:39,430 --> 02:25:41,739
''All right, l'll give it to her''

1482
02:25:42,750 --> 02:25:47,904
''l'm absolutely fine, Moneybags.
Honestly. Everything is fine''

1483
02:25:48,750 --> 02:25:53,460
l only feel that l'm slowly
falling in a deep ravine

1484
02:25:57,870 --> 02:26:02,739
''Bullshit, Moneybags! You don't
know what falling in a ravine is like''

1485
02:26:03,230 --> 02:26:08,748
''You've never fallen in one.
- l have, the first time l met you''

1486
02:26:10,750 --> 02:26:16,746
Absolutely.
My kurta and your pajama...!

1487
02:26:23,670 --> 02:26:27,424
Who wrote that?
- l don't know

1488
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:30,139
''Rabindranath Tagore, perhaps''

1489
02:26:30,830 --> 02:26:33,549
l... l can't recollect anything

1490
02:26:35,070 --> 02:26:37,220
My teacher's name...

1491
02:26:38,590 --> 02:26:40,740
the texts of Holy Geeta

1492
02:26:42,390 --> 02:26:46,144
R D Burman... l can't recollect.
- No problem

1493
02:26:46,670 --> 02:26:51,744
No problem? l don't even remember
the lyrics of Jai Jai Shiv Shanker

1494
02:26:52,030 --> 02:26:56,342
''No problem. l'll tell you.
- l knew it, Moneybags''

1495
02:26:56,750 --> 02:27:01,460
l used to remember everything.
- Want to discuss music with me?

1496
02:27:03,750 --> 02:27:07,538
Want to talk about my funeral rites?
- No Lekha

1497
02:27:07,990 --> 02:27:08,979
No

1498
02:27:11,590 --> 02:27:14,582
''ln the name of funeral rites,
they fleece people''

1499
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:19,220
''Moneybags,
l want to be electrolysed''

1500
02:27:20,750 --> 02:27:25,426
lt's non-pollutant. l've seen it
in the National Geographic Channel

1501
02:27:27,750 --> 02:27:28,705
All right

1502
02:27:28,950 --> 02:27:34,547
''l had discussed it with Ulhas, too''

1503
02:27:35,470 --> 02:27:37,745
Are you listening?
- Yes

1504
02:27:39,150 --> 02:27:41,141
l'm listening

1505
02:27:43,750 --> 02:27:49,222
l told him that he can give me
a funeral the way he wants

1506
02:27:50,550 --> 02:27:53,269
''ls it okay with you?
- Yes, okay''

1507
02:27:53,670 --> 02:27:55,661
Give my ashes to Ulhas

1508
02:27:56,750 --> 02:27:59,548
''Benaras, Gaya... let him
immerse it wherever he wants to''

1509
02:28:00,030 --> 02:28:02,339
For his solace

1510
02:28:04,750 --> 02:28:07,742
''Moneybags, you will have to rid
the habit of showing distaste''

1511
02:28:08,950 --> 02:28:12,545
Do l?
- lt shows right away on your face

1512
02:28:15,870 --> 02:28:21,547
''No one is at fault, though.
Stop blaming yourself''

1513
02:28:22,750 --> 02:28:25,742
That's all l ask you to do.
Everything else is fine

1514
02:28:28,750 --> 02:28:31,139
To hell with London and Paris

1515
02:28:31,670 --> 02:28:36,744
''Don't ever think that you kept me away
from music, from my music school...''

1516
02:28:37,190 --> 02:28:39,181
or from London and Paris

1517
02:28:39,870 --> 02:28:44,739
l don't care about those things.
They don't mean anything to me

1518
02:28:46,230 --> 02:28:50,542
''You believe me, don't you Moneybags?
- Yes, Lekha, yes''

1519
02:28:53,590 --> 02:28:58,584
''Good. Finally,
l have two wishes, Moneybags''

1520
02:28:59,750 --> 02:29:03,663
Will you give me?
- l will. Tell me

1521
02:29:04,150 --> 02:29:08,382
''Firstly, l want you to
always keep smiling''

1522
02:29:08,830 --> 02:29:11,390
You mustn't shed a tear

1523
02:29:13,550 --> 02:29:19,739
''Finally, within a year after
my death, you will marry again''

1524
02:29:21,150 --> 02:29:25,746
''Don't punish me like this, Lekha.
- l don't care, Moneybags. Promise me''

1525
02:29:30,830 --> 02:29:33,742
l... promise you

1526
02:29:35,310 --> 02:29:37,301
l promise.
- That's it

1527
02:29:39,750 --> 02:29:43,743
Lekha Khurzvekar had said
what she wanted to

1528
02:29:44,550 --> 02:29:46,666
''Come to me now, Moneybags''

1529
02:29:52,230 --> 02:29:55,745
''Not like this, Moneybags.
Take me in your arms''

1530
02:30:18,750 --> 02:30:21,139
''l'm happy now, Moneybags''

1531
02:30:22,150 --> 02:30:25,745
''ln your arms,
l feel l'm in heaven''

1532
02:31:15,750 --> 02:31:17,547
l wish...

1533
02:31:20,470 --> 02:31:23,462
l wish l never promised her...

1534
02:31:25,070 --> 02:31:30,064
that l'll be brave for your sake

1535
02:31:33,190 --> 02:31:36,421
l have no one in this world anymore

1536
02:31:38,310 --> 02:31:39,982
No one

1537
02:31:41,030 --> 02:31:43,021
''l'm there, Ulhas''

1538
02:31:45,470 --> 02:31:47,461
l'm your own

1539
02:32:38,830 --> 02:32:41,742
''Amar, you should've told me''

1540
02:32:42,590 --> 02:32:44,945
We came over as soon
as we got to know

1541
02:32:45,150 --> 02:32:48,142
''Why didn't you tell me, Amar?''

1542
02:32:49,750 --> 02:32:51,741
Why?
- Yes Amar?

1543
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:56,310
Amar... l want to help

1544
02:32:59,830 --> 02:33:02,344
Lekha is no more

1545
02:33:08,750 --> 02:33:11,218
''Forgive me, son''

1546
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:17,538
You don't apologise
to the one you love

1547
02:33:32,830 --> 02:33:35,469
''Return home, son.
Come back''

1548
02:33:36,150 --> 02:33:38,141
''Yes Papa, yes''

1549
02:34:06,750 --> 02:34:08,741
Lekha used to say...

1550
02:34:09,150 --> 02:34:14,747
some desires are fulfilled
while some remain unfulfilled

1551
02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:18,902
That's what life is all about
