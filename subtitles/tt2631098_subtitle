1
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:18,199
This is the story of three young friends.

2
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,271
This is Joe.

3
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,943
He is the producer of phone in
program called 'Love and Lost'.

4
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,348
This is who presents that show.

5
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,379
Ann Mathew.

6
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,282
Jo and Ann are in love
since three years.

7
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:41,493
Jo is her mentor.

8
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,837
This is camera man Peter.

9
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:56,932
He is not the hero of this film.
But you just keep an eye on him.

10
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:08,014
Hey guys, you are watching Ann
Mathews on yourfavorite show

11
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,121
'Love and lost'.

12
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,153
Love is a feel that we cannot
express through words.

13
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:17,786
All lovers and all those
who met with love failures...

14
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,158
- can call to this program.

15
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,264
You can share your
love experiences with us.

16
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,861
And, we have our
first caller on line. Hello!

17
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,129
Hello.
Who is this?

18
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,467
l'm Nimmy from Kannoor.

19
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:35,072
So we are dedicating this song
to Nimmy. Enjoy the song!

20
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,788
This is dedicated by
me to my boy friend.

21
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:58,797
This is Roshan. Dr. Roshan.
He is a cosmetic surgen.

22
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:03,701
He has just started working at
Cochin after his studies at America.

23
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,140
He is brilliant to
make ladies confident...

24
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:12,979
By reducing or increasing the fat
from their body for a perfect shape.

25
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,450
This is Abu. Abu Hameed.

26
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,959
He is one of the chief assistant
directors in Malayalam film industry.

27
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:30,969
Assistant to director Lal Jose. His
aim is to direct a film independently.

28
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,230
Now he is busy with his script.

29
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,765
Father, what is the meaning
of the word 'trampling'?

30
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:02,990
To use our foot on
something forcefully.

31
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,112
Father, he is coming.

32
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:21,620
What is your plan?

33
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,188
Are you going to be the savior
of Malayalam film industry?

34
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,383
Father, it's my ambition.

35
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,027
Today l have an appointment
with a producer to tell him my story.

36
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,028
This is not a field
meant for us people.

37
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,754
Don't you see my improvement?

38
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,927
Today l'm assistant to
director Lal Jose.

39
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,194
Tomorrow l will
become a director.

40
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,770
Can't you do some
otherjobs to live?

41
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,470
You fatty!!

42
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:04,592
Dear, l saw the original
English movie yesterday.

43
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,461
Just copied every
single dialogue from that...

44
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,134
Or if they are the ones
who copied from yours, ...

45
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,967
- you should not leave them.

46
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,941
Come after doing
something genuine as yours.

47
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,619
lt's risky to do with new faces.

48
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,326
Bring something for
some one who has satellite ...

49
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,557
- value as Mohanlal or Mammootty.

50
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,939
l'm fed up with Malayalam cinema.

51
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,872
Here it's all about
associations and their issues.

52
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,813
lf we bought a
script to any producer,...

53
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,644
- they are asking for the
date of a super star.

54
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,484
The only super star to support
youngsters is Mammootty.

55
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,747
But l don't have a script for him.

56
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,557
l'm planning to go to Chennai.
They are rocking there.

57
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,424
Plenty of good films are
being produced there

58
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:16,129
New directors, new actors,
we should follow them.

59
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,937
These are usual dialogues.
Don't make me to here ...

60
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,232
- you praising Tamil
movies any more.

61
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:29,742
The real problem is your lack of
astuteness. You do something here.

62
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:36,219
Now good movies are
coming in Malayalam in plenty.

63
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:42,193
l'm working with a script for a low
budget movie starring new faces.

64
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,827
Will you produce the movie?

65
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,858
l will produce the movie.
But l want to be the hero.

66
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:49,591
Me too

67
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,929
lf it is a good project l will fund
you by selling my mothers property

68
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,931
lt's pathetic.

69
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,819
'Urvashi Theatres'. How is
the name of our company?

70
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:09,280
Ann, will you marry me?

71
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,018
My knee is paining.
Ann, answer me fast.

72
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,886
Why are you asking
in a busy manner?

73
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,723
We are in love since
last three years.

74
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,402
l can wait no longer. So will you?

75
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,616
Let us stop this Jo.

76
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:51,815
l can't marry you. l'm sorry.

77
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:01,629
l'm a cancer patient.

78
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,707
l came to know this in a
blood test before two months.

79
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,778
l will not be alive
more than two years.

80
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,847
l hide it from you as
l don't want you to be sad.

81
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,393
Tell me.

82
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,569
lt went wrong. You get ready
fast and come down stairs.

83
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:55,571
We want to go to
Jo's flat. lt's urgent.

84
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:26,432
My God! What is this?
Come, we will go to the hospital.

85
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,604
l want to die. Let me to.

86
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,941
No need of that. lt's nothing serious.

87
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:37,014
Only a small wound. You should die
after cutting your wane, stupid!

88
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,809
What is the need of
your emotional drama now?

89
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:43,816
F***!

90
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,330
This is her photos!

91
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:02,297
He is so stupid!
Fool!

92
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,877
What do you mean by this?

93
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,715
Are you going to die for her cancer?

94
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,413
Such a rare love in this generation?

95
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,757
You don't know. She cheated me.

96
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:27,825
She was lying me as she is
a cancer patient to avoid me.

97
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:28,729
Why?

98
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,437
She said me that l have
never kissed her even ...

99
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,641
- once in those three years of love.

100
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,777
She said that l didn't
even touch her hand.

101
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:52,520
So, you do nothing? Simply
hanging around!

102
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,924
We call this as erectile dysfunction.

103
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,227
Leave it man. She is
not the only girl out there.

104
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:14,108
But l'm disappointed upon you as
you make her leave as a virgin.

105
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,977
She might have a new boy by now.
That's why she avoided you.

106
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,915
Don't speak about her like that.

107
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,213
Ok, sorry.

108
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,284
Don't you know that Jo loved her so
sincerely since the last three years?

109
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,122
So this one also belongs
to the divine love!

110
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,241
This is the last piece.
After him it's over.

111
00:15:52,851 --> 00:16:00,587
But how can she avoid her?
She was making me a fool.

112
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,028
He started again.

113
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:07,326
Why are you crying like
girls? Let her go.

114
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,663
You find a new one.
There are so many girls out there.

115
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,738
Change your soft heart
into a stone. Be a man.

116
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,767
This is all because of that Rahman.

117
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,972
Which Rahman?
A.R. Rahman.

118
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,876
A.R. Rahman? How is that?

119
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:31,515
That day we were watching
news in TV at our channel.

120
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:37,825
As the news said that Rahman won
the Oscar, She kissed me with joy.

121
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,828
She was a dead fan of Rahman.

122
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,165
When she hugged me, the
chemistry started working.

123
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,001
Rahman, The innocent!

124
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,205
You just forget it and go to the
channel. Concentrate on yourjob.

125
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,371
l can't. l can't go to
that channel any more.

126
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,540
At every *************...

127
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,377
Each and every corner in that
channel contains her memories.

128
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,049
Our romance started there.

129
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,259
Full of memories?
Let us make it into fire.

130
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,231
You just go out somewhere
and get refreshed yourself.

131
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,737
l think, we can plan a trip.
Chill out for some days.

132
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,230
Let's go to Goa or Ladak or
somewhere else like that.

133
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,605
Goa is the right choice. lt's
the location for my first film.

134
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,243
That's perfect.

135
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,876
Then no need to
waste time on planning.

136
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,815
We are starting now?
What do you say?

137
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:36,818
Action!

138
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,387
Since now there will
be no girl in my life.

139
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:02,607
''As a bottle of chilled alcohol''

140
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,878
''l made you seated in
the freezer of my heart''

141
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:12,153
''lt's my fault for being
late to bring you close to lip''

142
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:16,955
''lt's my fault for
disagreeing to taste you''

143
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:23,731
''As in front of a
closed beverage shop''

144
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,436
''l stood in front of you like a fool.''

145
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:37,276
''Oh girl, you leaved
me as cool as it is''

146
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:50,828
''You made my life
into a waste pond.''

147
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,993
''l am in the state to fish l that pond''

148
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,465
She cheated me Uncle.

149
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,761
Please hug me and
feel sorry to me uncle.

150
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,306
''You made
everything into a dream,''

151
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:14,010
''Oh dream girl,
you was cool to leave me.''

152
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:34,165
''l felt myself as a beggar
in front of the Oberon mall''

153
00:19:52,925 --> 00:20:06,328
''The script made by
me was a super flop''

154
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:12,904
''You, the heroin in
that became a super star.''

155
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,675
True love will happen
only once in our life.

156
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:28,416
So, love your soul mate 100 percent
sincerely and celebrate your love...

157
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,427
For any issues connected with love,
Ann Mathew is there for you.

158
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,231
My number is...

159
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,965
Why are you not calling?

160
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,101
Shit!

161
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,479
You may manage this.

162
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,483
Where were you looking
while driving?

163
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,520
Shame! As she looks
nice l expected some...

164
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,856
- high standard dialogues.

165
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:16,433
According to her looks we can assume
that she is a country girl, ...

166
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,159
- Right?

167
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:21,764
You!

168
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,137
So you are drunk.

169
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,607
Yes.
l will call the police now.

170
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,338
Why are you shouting?

171
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,982
We didn't hit your vehicle?
Will you call the police?

172
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,482
Where are the police?
Don't try to make us afraid.

173
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,122
Leave it now. There is no
use to talk to them.

174
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:45,625
Uses are there. But you too
should coordinate with us.

175
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,630
We can just rock.

176
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:48,964
You!

177
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,131
lt will not be fairto leave them.

178
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:57,764
Come here.
That girl is clever.

179
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,308
Aren't there any men in your family?

180
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,601
l mean in your vehicle.

181
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,007
You dog!

182
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:08,018
Two perfect pieces.
So ourjourney started well.

183
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,921
But for one, male elements are more.

184
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,349
Vehicle with a good pick up.

185
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,022
ls it a wedding?

186
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,090
Move

187
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,265
You are a Malayali?

188
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,704
There is a lady director
in Malayalam in this name.

189
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:15,308
l'm also a director.
l mean l will...

190
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:19,214
My first film's location is Goa.
l will expect your helps.

191
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,484
Are they coming here?

192
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:55,288
Yes. What happened? lsn't she
working in a channel programmer?

193
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,660
l'm the director of that program.

194
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:04,633
You know what?
She is my ex girl friend.

195
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,333
l came here to forget her.
Now she is here.

196
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,037
How can you tolerate this?

197
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:23,380
Why are you here?

198
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,490
Do you think that this is fare?

199
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,323
You loved me for three years
and then you avoided me.

200
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,325
And now you are asking
me 'how are you'?

201
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:42,300
You cheater. l thought
you are my friend.

202
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:47,638
Ok, leave it. But, you could find
only this black ugly camera man?

203
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,807
Take it in the right spirit Jo.

204
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,817
We tried three years.

205
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,886
But our chemistry didn't work
out and so we broke out.

206
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,718
Chemistry, Physics and geography
between us didn't work out.

207
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,957
But the truth is l loved you sincerely.

208
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,534
Now you don't want me.
lsn't that true?

209
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:17,140
No Jo. We will never
be set together.

210
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:25,612
Look Jo. l'm an independent
woman. l have my own decisions.

211
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,178
We have already
cleared these things.

212
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,784
And peter is a man who has
the same wave length to me.

213
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,155
So we decided to live together.

214
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,521
Hello!
No need of explaining more.

215
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,397
You beggar.

216
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,689
Are they staying together?
Yes.

217
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,020
Same room?
Yes sir.

218
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,902
You know what? l loved her more
than any thing. Still l love her.

219
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,837
But the wave length
is different for her.

220
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,174
How can that be possible?
So sad sir.

221
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,639
You don't know to play.

222
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,104
She wants to play.

223
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,800
She went with some
one who knows to play.

224
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,138
What is wrong with that?

225
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,905
At last camera man took the girl!

226
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,709
Now l see that a man
of evil gets the land of evil.

227
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:12,085
Let's return.
To where?

228
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,393
Then, how can l stay here in
their presence? Come on man.

229
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,426
lf you think of that
you will understand.

230
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:22,158
She is ok here.
Then what's wrong with you.

231
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,430
Let her go. Please don't make
yourself ashamed in front of a girl.

232
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:33,971
Hey man, my heart is
broken into thousand pieces.

233
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,579
At least l want to
change the hotel.

234
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,944
lf you changed the hotel,
she will laugh upon you.

235
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:47,324
You can't hide yourself from the
truth. How much will you run?

236
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:54,125
Now she is not yours. You
should accept things as they are.

237
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,799
Look, they are our neighbors.

238
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:21,418
Jo, this is not fair.
Are you following us?

239
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:29,198
So, now l'm wrong to you.
You are the truth. You are a bitch.

240
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:33,125
Peter! Remember, tomorrow
you will think of this.

241
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,066
She cheated me.
She will cheat you also.

242
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,038
Now l remember the dialogue
of Narendraprasad...

243
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,041
- in the film
'Kaliyattom'

244
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:45,978
'Perumalayan! She cheated her
father. She may cheat you also'

245
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,680
Let it be!
Ann!

246
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,717
l have some thing to
talk to you in personal.

247
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:02,996
Then make it fast.
l'm sorry Ann. Forgive me.

248
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,569
Even now l'm ready to live with you.

249
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,532
Come with me. You can
live like what ever you like.

250
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,845
You can use any type of dress.

251
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,004
Let's forget everything happened.

252
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,615
l can forget the night
that you spend with him.

253
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:25,553
Because l believe in the love with
two hearts. Not with the body.

254
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:33,188
Come with me please. Now the
only figure in my mind is yourface.

255
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:39,336
l can't live without you.
Look, l attempted a suicide.

256
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,297
You tried to suicide?
Yes.

257
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,709
You are not able to do that.
What do you mean?

258
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:55,409
l know you. You don't
even has the courage to suicide.

259
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:02,621
Any ways, best of
luck for the next time.

260
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:05,218
Ann!

261
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,193
Every thing is over
Jo. Try to understand.

262
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:17,330
Aren't you satisfied?
What a girl she is?

263
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,305
You saved yourself from her.

264
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:26,411
Try to forget every thing
Jo. We are in Goa.

265
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,882
Let's chill out man. Come...

266
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:41,680
Look! ls that them? Spicy girls!

267
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,351
By this time you named them?

268
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:50,822
They are going to that restaurant.

269
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,159
Don't we want to meet them?

270
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,660
Do we?
Yes.

271
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:05,839
Yes?
Do we?

272
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:11,275
We do.
Yes.

273
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,006
Yes.

274
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,083
Come. You too come on.

275
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,381
Because of her mother
she is not looking at.

276
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:24,791
We made them ashamed.
Then how will they?

277
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:31,459
So guys, let me talk to them.

278
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,573
Don't play. This is Goa.

279
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:45,813
Goa is too familiarto me. She
will fell down.You just watch it.

280
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,828
A murder is sure.

281
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,324
Can l sit here?

282
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,265
What?

283
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,737
Thank you.

284
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:13,874
Two boring love stories in Goa.
Please get me a twist.

285
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,576
Thank you.

286
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:25,981
Actually l'm sorry. l want to
say sorry to you for yesterday.

287
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:31,227
Who told you to sit here? lf
you don't leave l will complaint.

288
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,893
lf your anger will be finished,
you can do me anything.

289
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:39,927
lf you want, you can hit
me by that Hindi man.

290
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:50,206
l have a problem. lf l drank
7 or 8 peg l will be so silent.

291
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:54,313
At that time l'm
interested in talking to myself.

292
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,719
Too good!

293
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,478
But lf l'm only with three,
l will be so boring.

294
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:04,718
Yesterday l drank only three pegs.

295
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:10,660
- That's why l behave
to you so rudely.

296
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:15,706
But when our vehicles scratched
each other, when we met today,

297
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,772
l feel some thing n mind.

298
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,273
Some thing is going to happen.

299
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,908
lt's not your feel brother. lt's truth.

300
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,415
The twist has come.

301
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,120
Now the play is in mud.

302
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:50,635
This is nothing to me. Only thing l
want from you is to forgive me.

303
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,173
You were true. The fall happened.

304
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,178
lt's not beautiful. Come.

305
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,109
Every hero and heroin
starts their love from a clash.

306
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,841
Don't you see in
Priyadarshan movies?

307
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,483
Thanks. This way...

308
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,089
We will see next time.

309
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,089
That's enough. This way...

310
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,372
Nice underwear and banyan!

311
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,371
Yes.

312
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:34,882
What? This is shorts. Stupid.
Shots!

313
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,614
See guys. No need
to waste your time.

314
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,119
We are not the
ones as you think.

315
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,525
What do you think about us?

316
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,127
We are not interested
to know about you.

317
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,028
Are you not satisfied with
what you got yesterday?

318
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:51,268
We are ready to tolerate
anything for you.

319
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:53,698
Nonsense.

320
00:37:55,573 --> 00:38:01,307
This will never work out...
if we are moving like this.

321
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,113
Let's see.

322
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,380
Hopefully, a twist may
come in the story.

323
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,678
Let's see.

324
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:21,296
Hey, hot chicks. Hold on.
Pose for a picture.

325
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,908
This is the chance.

326
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,100
Go and rock it man!

327
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,573
She should fell in love
with you seeing your fight.

328
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,285
Enough. Go.

329
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,663
My mother!

330
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,534
Malayali?
Yes. Sabu.

331
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,503
That's it.

332
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,069
Sabu!

333
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,107
Usual scene.

334
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:16,916
Hero helps the heroin to escape
from the villain. Like a Telugu film.

335
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,779
But some times it can
happen in life also.

336
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:23,490
Don't kill me. l came here to
celebrate New Year.

337
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,459
l will lie here. l don't
want to go any where.

338
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,497
These are nothing to me.

339
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,808
Don't you want to
impress your heroin?

340
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,679
Don't turn it.

341
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,118
No need to kill him.

342
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:53,790
You said it on the
right time. All are down.

343
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,620
Are you still angry up on us?

344
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,628
We are impressed.

345
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:14,168
Lunch?
What do you think?

346
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,540
- Ok.
- Ok.

347
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,349
Hi. l'm Alice Mathews
from Kottayam.

348
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,630
She is Saniya. She
is from Mattanchery.

349
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:37,291
We are final year
MBBS students at Hyderabad.

350
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:42,099
We came here just for fun.

351
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,033
So you are free birds.

352
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:50,045
No. My parents are in US
and her parents are in Dubai.

353
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,510
l must say one thing.

354
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,786
You look so hot.
Really

355
00:40:58,923 --> 00:40:59,582
Yes.

356
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:06,629
This is his usual feeling.
Then l must say one thing doctor.

357
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,128
Yes please.

358
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:12,499
Are you here to just flirt
with us we are not interested.

359
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,570
Can't you take it as a compliment?

360
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:21,907
lf a girl is beautiful we
should say that. Am l right?

361
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,404
Yes.

362
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,907
But, we can understand these types
of dialogues at the very beginning.

363
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,611
You can talk to us as a doctor.
Let's be good friends.

364
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:39,421
Then, shall we talk about
the side effects of Viagra?

365
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:42,899
lt will be nice.

366
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:46,027
Are you interested in acting?

367
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:52,037
What? Don't make a play upon me.

368
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,373
No. l'm serious. You should
reduce 5 kilo grams of your weight.

369
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,314
l'm in search for the
heroin for my first film.

370
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,645
Every one will be new faces.

371
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,345
He will be one of the producers.

372
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,821
Any ways, l don't
want to be an actress.

373
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:09,583
Why?

374
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,625
l feel pity upon them

375
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,696
Before becoming an adult
they are becoming actresses.

376
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:21,395
Then they are asked
about their personal...

377
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,335
- tastes in several channel interviews.

378
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,369
Then they start believing themselves
that they are some one too big.

379
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:30,471
After some gossips with
some leading actors...

380
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,774
- they will be married to some soft
ware engineers from America.

381
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,077
They will get divorced
within one year ...

382
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,390
- and starts to act in mega
serials in the role of mother.

383
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,389
Those who enjoyed the
taste of celebrity status...

384
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,791
- can't be able to loose
them for their family.

385
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:47,725
Yes.

386
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,897
At last they will be alone in there life.

387
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:54,301
With out a perfect
personal life all is in wane.

388
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,530
There are many actresses
who live a perfect family life.

389
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,708
They know how to act
in front of the public.

390
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:06,782
So you know the facts.
You can't be cheated easily.

391
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,887
Any ways, l loved it.
What?

392
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,623
l mean your sensibility.
Your character.

393
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,723
He feels this usually.

394
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,230
Will you be ready to
marry an actress?

395
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,822
For what? We can earn
more through that way.

396
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,060
Oh, please!

397
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:31,803
Hey Jo!

398
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,581
Hey Jo! How are you?

399
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,876
l'm fine. l'm perfect.

400
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,383
That's good. l think you
are not angry with me.

401
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:52,023
l will be your god friend for ever.

402
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,592
lf you don't mind you
can join us fortoday's dinner.

403
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:06,401
lt's been a long time since we get
together. What do you think?

404
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:11,672
Sure. Why not?

405
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,781
See you at the dinner.

406
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:19,985
Bye Jo.

407
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:28,730
Why did you invite you
with out asking me a word?

408
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,757
How can we comfortable
in his presence?

409
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:35,061
This is not that cool.
This is not America.

410
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,338
So you know that
this is not America!

411
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:43,102
What do you mean?
You are blaming me?

412
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,408
l was joking

413
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,780
The only difference for
us from the Americans is that...

414
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:53,752
The open activities of Americans
are done by us behind a curtain.

415
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,189
What happened?
Where are your friends?

416
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,855
Friends! They are not true friends.

417
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:34,759
They are in the restaurant. They
have interest only in having alcohol.

418
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,096
Look Anjali. Please sit. Sit.

419
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:54,408
Taking photographs without
permission! This is bad Jo.

420
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:02,992
l know. But l can't control me.
Please help me Anjali.

421
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:09,557
What can l do? First of all you
should decide yourself. You can.

422
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:17,963
l feel very lonely. Anjali, please
make me relaxed. Please hug me.

423
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:18,971
What?

424
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,114
Why can't you see
me as your friend?

425
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,109
We have just met last day.

426
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,911
lt's so fast for me to be
yourfriend in such a short time.

427
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,150
Many guests will arrive
here as a hotel.

428
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:37,927
l'm behaving to you as a
part of this hotel's hospitality.

429
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:43,963
Only that much?
Yes. Can l ask you one thing?

430
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:48,930
Sure. What's it?
Shall we meet a psychiatrist?

431
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:54,176
Psychiatrist or psychologists.
l don't like seeing them.

432
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,935
Did you meet with them?

433
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,472
l met three. But no use.

434
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,750
Now what will we do?

435
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:05,915
lf l told you one thing,
will you agree with me?

436
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,923
Let me hear it.

437
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,791
Can you come with
me for a dinnertonight?

438
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,923
Why do you feel like that?

439
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,701
That Peter and Ann has
invited me for a dinner.

440
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:24,437
But l can't face herfor a long time.

441
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:28,973
lf you are with me l will be
comfortable. Will you please?

442
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:29,737
No.

443
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,373
Please Anjali.
No Jo!

444
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,278
As a friend of mine.

445
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,418
Please. No.
Please Anjali.

446
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:41,821
Ok. Ok. l will. But, just friends. Ok?

447
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,517
But in front of them we are...
What?

448
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,362
Can't you understand?

449
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,928
That Ann should feel
jealous up on me seeing...

450
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,830
- a beautiful girl with me like you...

451
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:59,131
Like l feel when l see peter with her.

452
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:04,804
l know girl's psychology. l
should do at least this.

453
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:09,315
So, you want me to act
like your girl friend.

454
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:13,387
Forthat you don't have to do any
thing. You just come with me.

455
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:19,289
But... we arejust friends. Ok?

456
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:22,293
Yes. We arejust friends. Deal!

457
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:30,972
Ok deal.
Deal. Thank you so much.

458
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:47,417
Wow! Look! lndian
women are so beautiful!

459
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:55,431
Hey Jo!
Thanks for coming Jo. Please sit.

460
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,827
l started drinking.

461
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,004
This is Anjali.

462
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:05,632
Hi Anjali. l have seen
you before. Our receptionist!

463
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,939
l should say. You look so pretty.

464
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:09,908
Thank you.

465
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,017
You beggar. Are
you trying for another!

466
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:16,776
Don't you know Ann?

467
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,386
Sure

468
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:21,252
l know many boys who
watches only Ann's TV program.

469
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,388
They will die for Ann.

470
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,290
Sure?
They are really mad about you.

471
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,260
Thank you.

472
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:39,832
ln America, couples
used to meet again after ...

473
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,706
- divorce to refresh theirfriendship.

474
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:48,382
Like Prithviraj, me too studied
at Australia and America.

475
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:54,322
Every one will be attracted
to their opposite sex.

476
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,586
We should show that.

477
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:01,020
We should be free. Like a free bird.

478
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,989
We should set free our
emotions. Just celebrate our life.

479
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:09,136
According to me we should
have ten more loves like this.

480
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:14,170
l cannot agree with this. We will
get attracted as it is quiet natural.

481
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:18,643
But we should control ourselves.
That's called commitments.

482
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,009
There lies the strength
of lndian tradition.

483
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:26,881
Wife, husband, children,
family, these all mean a lot.

484
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:31,891
You sound like an idol
lndian women...

485
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,587
- following all the moral values.

486
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:39,132
Are you joking?
No. l feel proud.

487
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:49,769
Hey Jo! You are lucky. Anjali is a
nice girl. And she is smart too.

488
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,910
We are just friends.
No.

489
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:06,151
Your eyes are speaking me.
Eyes will never lie.

490
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:45,360
Our life will face situations like
this. lt's hard for some days.

491
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:50,370
l faced a situation like
yours three times before.

492
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,442
Then you were having
three girl friends before me.

493
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,804
Why didn't you tell me this?

494
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,753
l'm sorry.

495
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:13,422
Alcohol will bring things out
of my mind. Bloody alcohol!

496
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:18,392
Jo! Let me reveal that.

497
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:22,430
How many years did you
and Ann loved each other?

498
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:23,865
Three years.

499
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:31,774
ln two years out of those three
years me and Ann were in relation.

500
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:41,091
Ann! Why didn't you tell me that?
l was becoming a fool.

501
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:45,052
Jo! Control Jo!
l'm leaving off.

502
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,628
Sit down there.

503
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:54,666
Why are you running off from the
truth? Hey, one more peg please!

504
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,311
Sorry guys. l want to leave.

505
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:11,215
Anjali!

506
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:15,723
Jo, all the best man.
And don't miss her.

507
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,424
Anjali! Please stop there.
Let me explain.

508
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,721
No. l'm not a property
for you to show your...

509
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,060
- anger up on your
ex girl friend.

510
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:28,064
What can l do if peter said
some thing while drinking?

511
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,614
l think l'm in love with you.

512
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:19,788
Don't make things complicated.
l don't like this.

513
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,519
Seeing your situation l
felt sympathy on you.

514
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:26,628
l want to make you
happy. That's all.

515
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:37,066
Why didn't you tell me that you
had three girl friends before me?

516
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,266
Because l drank before
you forthe first time.

517
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,604
Alcohol brings the
truths out of me.

518
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,510
You made me
ashamed before them.

519
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:49,080
What did you say? Do
you need ten more relations?

520
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,716
l will decide what l should say.

521
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:59,117
Don't act innocent.
You cheated that Jo.

522
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:02,959
All for you. Wasn't that
you who came after me?

523
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,062
Now l feel that Jo was
the better person than you.

524
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:11,366
l know you well. You cannot
satisfy with an only man.

525
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:12,632
What did you say?

526
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,376
l felt ashamed before
that receptionist.

527
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,941
Yes!

528
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,687
You are having jealousy on her.

529
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:51,376
''This happiness questing
forflowers in the sky''

530
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:56,479
''lt's beating heavily in the heart.''

531
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,961
''Some thirst came silently into me''

532
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:15,936
''l came to see you on your path''

533
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:24,707
''Now, each minute
are colorful wings''

534
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:29,718
''Lovely shore which
shines in the sun,''

535
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,147
''Showers the smiles''

536
00:56:54,177 --> 00:57:03,643
''The wave sings lovely
tunes and the land listens ''

537
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:13,559
''l blossomed without
knowing day or night''

538
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:55,629
Hi, morning!

539
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:02,894
Thanks.

540
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:11,974
What a night!
Was it too much?

541
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,508
Stupid!

542
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:20,518
Hi!
Hello!

543
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:24,489
Hi!
Alice! Let's return.

544
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:25,123
Sure.

545
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,219
We have already missed
two practical classes.

546
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:27,792
Yes.

547
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:31,422
So what? You have got two
excellent practical classes here.

548
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:35,162
This doctor is very brilliant
forthe practical classes.

549
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,040
Are you leaving?
Yes.

550
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,474
Can't you stay fortwo more days?

551
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,475
No way! We have to
leave at least today.

552
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,773
We can meet again.
Time is there in plenty!

553
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:50,417
Then ok. Let's go.
Come on, hurry up.

554
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:53,414
We have rocked my buddy!

555
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,387
You?
Yes.

556
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,211
Hey, pack your bag
quickly. Let's leave.

557
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:31,554
You may go. l have
some thing to do here.

558
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:36,291
At the reception! Good!

559
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:10,897
Hey, don't sleep. Talk some
thing. Otherwise l will get asleep.

560
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:17,164
Just think about those girls. We will
never sleep. What a beauty!

561
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:22,707
Saniya is too good.
What if l married her?

562
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:28,709
l liked her very much.
Her smell is so mesmerizing.

563
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:35,018
This is your problem. Will anybody
buy a toddy shop for some toddy!

564
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:36,591
That is a dialogue from a movie.

565
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:41,025
That is also said like this,' will any
body buy a cow for some milk?'

566
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:45,096
lf the milk is too good
we should buy the cow.

567
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,266
Only one mistake. First
night has already celebrated.

568
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,637
Both are NRl kids. Money
might be in plenty with them

569
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:57,744
lf l married her herfather
will produce my film.

570
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:04,350
They are calling!

571
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,079
Hello!
Hello!

572
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:08,621
Don't they have my number?

573
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,160
Hello!
Hello Roshan!

574
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:18,133
What's up! Where are you now?

575
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,603
l felt like l want to say
one thing to Roshan now.

576
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:28,309
Tell me.Do you know
what l have liked in you?

577
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,276
What's it!

578
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:35,609
Naughty! What a curiosity to know!
Please tell me that.

579
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:43,347
The mole on your right thigh.
That was not my thigh.

580
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,896
Abu wants to speak
something to Saniya.

581
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,394
Saniya!
Yes.

582
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:55,560
l was serious when l
asked you to act in movie.

583
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,897
When we meet next time you should
reduce your weight of 5 kilos.

584
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:00,202
Why not!

585
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:06,509
But, to meet again, you
will not be alive, you dog.

586
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:16,118
What did you think of us?
Now listen carefully.

587
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:28,996
One of us is carrying Aids. That
means, now one of you have Aids.

588
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:34,037
Now, just enjoy the pain! Love you!

589
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:47,013
They might be joking!
Call them once more.

590
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:54,018
Shit!

591
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:21,219
One of them..!

592
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,220
Any way, you turn the vehicle.
Let's go back to Goa.

593
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,933
We shall have an enquiry.
So, shall we go back?

594
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:32,998
You turn the vehicle!

595
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:38,123
Don't we have to meet Jo?

596
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:42,828
No. Already he is tensed.

597
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,373
l didn't even think
about a trap like this.

598
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,516
How can we explain
this to somebody?

599
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:04,019
There is an S l here who was
my neighbor- Raviyettan.

600
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:07,052
Shall we go to the
police station here?

601
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:10,163
Are you sure?

602
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:12,493
Yes.

603
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,765
So, you too got that opportunity!

604
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:56,178
What's wrong with you? At least you
are a doctor. And you, Director!

605
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:06,513
Two same cases were reported
here within the last four months.

606
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,288
Till now we can't
now their intension.

607
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:15,094
After every thing they will
call the boys saying that '....

608
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,561
- one of you have
got this disease'.

609
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,324
A rare case of sadism.

610
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:25,005
We are tracing them. Their
name and identity are fake.

611
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:27,141
Even their mobile numbers are fake

612
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,611
lf they were Saniya and
Alice in front of you,

613
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:32,978
- they will be in other
names in the other cases.

614
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:37,075
So, you need to see this to
know that! Aren't you a doctor?

615
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:39,272
These are the
problems if you became ...

616
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,437
- doctor with yourfather's money.

617
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:43,344
Will you check Google to
know your father's name?

618
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:45,648
What time will it take
to know that whether...

619
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:46,777
- we have this disease or not?

620
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:51,487
lt will take at least one month.

621
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:54,822
But with the help of latest tests,
some times we can know it earlier.

622
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:57,488
But we have to be tensed
for at least 10 to 12 days.

623
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:03,503
Then it depends the
immunity of each body. ...

624
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,700
6 months, one year, two years...

625
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,968
That's Aids.

626
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,478
Yes! Now l remember.

627
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:18,384
l have done a documentary
about Aids some times before.

628
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:23,283
So, you did that
without knowing these?

629
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:11,437
Bull shit! Why don't they say
who it is? This was planned.

630
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:22,240
Roshan! Are the joking?
What is their intention?

631
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,042
Don't you hear that police officer...?

632
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:30,591
- that two persons are
awaiting death because of them?

633
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,720
But, what can we do now?

634
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:39,232
What to do? Just to live
as dead till knowing the fact.

635
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:43,196
lf l got those Devils in my hand...

636
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,970
One of them is awaiting
death like us.

637
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:55,878
At that time we didn't use this.

638
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:44,665
Where were you till now?

639
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:50,227
l was in the church. Now,
only God can save us.

640
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:54,300
What did you pray?
l prayed to make me safe.

641
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:57,775
You cruel! That means,
let me have that disease!

642
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:03,017
Does it mean that? You
are the reason for all these.

643
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,344
You made me to do this.

644
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:12,457
Think of yourself. ls that you
who are apt to die than me?

645
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:19,729
l must be here to do some
good films. God knows that.

646
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,826
You dog!

647
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,032
You just think.

648
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:29,304
According to my opinion
she might be the...

649
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:30,469
- one who is having the disease.

650
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:36,482
Who?
Your girl Alice. She had a bad smell.

651
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:39,178
Aids have no special smell.

652
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,891
And it is a very rare case for a
disease to affect a doctor.

653
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:47,161
Why? Diseases are
afraid of doctors?

654
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:53,329
l think its Saniya. A doctor's
opinion can't be wrong so easily.

655
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:59,405
She was often sneezing. She was
having the signs of a patient.

656
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:03,077
No. She is a good girl.

657
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,108
lsn't she?

658
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,244
Look! l said it!

659
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:30,399
This is Pisharody swami's house.
We have an appointment here.

660
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:33,138
So, this is why you
made me get up earlier?

661
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:37,846
l know that you will never come
hearing the truth. He is brilliant!

662
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,949
Astrology, numerology, gemology,
palmistry, and every thing he knows.

663
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:44,211
You know what?

664
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,751
Film star Sunil
changed his name into Narain..

665
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:47,719
- according to Swami's advice.

666
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:51,388
He acts in films
only when swami says.

667
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:54,320
We, film makers believe in them.

668
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:58,826
So he is the reason for every
film starto change their name.

669
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,333
l'm leaving.

670
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,437
Don't do that.

671
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,834
Any way your medical science
has nothing to do in this case.

672
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,942
So come on.

673
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:14,314
Hello Swami!
Hello! Come, come.

674
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,611
Why are you not coming to the
beverage shop these days?

675
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:22,985
Family problems. l will be fighting
with my wife daily for drinking.

676
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:26,125
So l decided not to
drink for some days.

677
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:29,723
ls your daughter studying
at Bangalore for MCA?

678
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:35,400
Nothing to say. She
went with a Christian boy ...

679
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:40,304
- who was her class mate.

680
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,770
What's the matter to
see me so urgently?

681
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:46,908
This is Roshan, doctor.

682
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,775
Now let's come to the point.

683
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:52,845
We want to know how
many years will we live.

684
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:55,516
Nobody can fore say that.

685
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,281
We don't need an exact result.

686
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,632
Who among us have
weak life duration?

687
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:06,665
What happened?

688
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,767
Did you start some wrong
business leaving film direction?

689
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,002
Every thing is going wrong swami!

690
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:39,164
This is not supposed to say. lt's
against our professional ethics.

691
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:44,098
You can say any thing
to us as you know.

692
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,436
Among us who has a weak life time?

693
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:13,959
Your life is short.
What?

694
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:18,566
Pray to God very well.

695
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,136
This is cheating.

696
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:26,611
You have drunk alcohol from me
daily and now you are lying to me?

697
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,613
Next time when you come to me,
l will show you.

698
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:31,419
But l will not live till then.

699
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:37,291
Swami! lt was so cheap.
You asked me to say the truth!

700
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:48,559
Any how, l feel like believing
in these things.You!

701
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,096
This scene is over. A nasty scene!

702
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:09,422
l have told you many times to avoid
your friendship with that doctor.

703
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:13,186
He is employed.
But what about you?

704
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,132
Your life is short.

705
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:43,489
How many times we told
you to stop your friendship...

706
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:44,853
- with that doctor boy!

707
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:50,526
Mother!
What's it?

708
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:59,606
Look at my face. Do you feel like
l'm sick? You are tired. Are you not well?

709
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:03,205
Nothing. No problem.

710
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,614
Romance should be
given to selected ones.

711
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:47,652
ln my career as an actor, there is
only one thing that l will pray daily.

712
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,621
That is not to make
me act in my real life.

713
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:53,159
For that make every
relationship safe.

714
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:56,057
Be conscious about your life.

715
01:18:56,398 --> 01:19:00,835
Remember, the only way to avoid
HlV is to be careful ourselves.

716
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:05,366
Sir, shot ready.

717
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:09,677
Remember. There is
no retake in life.

718
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,559
So terrible to see.

719
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:36,268
A non believer of God
going to the temple!

720
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:40,708
As you did, l prayed
that please don't give the...

721
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:42,571
- disease to me and give it to you.

722
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:49,377
Let's see, among Hindu God and
Muslim God who is more powerful.

723
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:06,323
Hey, they are calling!

724
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:10,362
Hello!

725
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:12,831
Hello, please don't cut the phone.

726
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:14,503
Hello! Hello!

727
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,935
At least now please
tell us who that is.

728
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:22,277
What a tension! T's interesting
to hear. lsn't it Saniya?

729
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,518
Hello! Saniya please tell me.

730
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:32,284
So sad. Should l say?

731
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,758
We have dreamed so
many things. Please tell us.

732
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:45,240
Let's see. Abu? Or Roshan?

733
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:53,678
Please tell.
Roshan. No, he may not be.

734
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,076
Dam it!

735
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:59,979
But Abu can be the man.
Seeing his specs and that look...

736
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:03,416
- he may be the right one.

737
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:08,553
So sad Abu! Abu!
Please tell that. Please!

738
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:12,133
Why? Just wait for one more weak.

739
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,336
Ok. l shall tell you.

740
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:17,664
Please!

741
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:22,906
Dr. Mr. Roshan. You are dead man!

742
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:27,608
You are that lucky guy!

743
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:04,651
Why are you doing this to me?

744
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:07,251
Why are you so cruel?

745
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:16,389
Do you remember Anita George?

746
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:23,934
An innocent girl thrown
by you after your use.

747
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:26,934
She was alone in a house at
Bangalore for months as a mad...

748
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:28,669
- one only because of you.

749
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:34,513
Last month she committed suicide.
lt's only because of you.

750
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,083
We met each otherjust
one day before her suicide.

751
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,517
She was my best friend

752
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,653
You made her mad. You bastard!

753
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:24,621
So that relation is over. ln your
language, expiry date is over.

754
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:29,759
Did l ever promise you that l will
marry you? Are you a fool?

755
01:23:29,904 --> 01:23:32,839
l thought that you can
understand this.

756
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:37,539
But, you don't have to beat
her. After all, use and throw.

757
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:40,612
After the romance party l
must escape from here.

758
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:42,876
These girls will never
let me go easily.

759
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:47,051
Did you ever love a girl sincerely?

760
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:54,327
l have shared the bed
with more than twenty girls.

761
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:57,795
Each girl differs in smell,
color, and taste.

762
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:02,659
There is so much to know man!

763
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:09,770
She wept so much thinking about
you. She loved you so much.

764
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:15,172
Nasty men! One cheated me also.
He pretended as loving me.

765
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:22,253
l was trapped. Later l knew
that he was HlV infected.

766
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,618
l will also die soon.

767
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:30,231
But l want to do some
good things before my death.

768
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:32,964
l gave my disease to
two more devils like you.

769
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:42,309
They might also be
running with fear like you.

770
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:50,407
But l'm sad to know that l will
not be alive to see you dying.

771
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:53,820
So man, you are dead.
See you in hell!

772
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:57,748
Hello! Hello! Hello!

773
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:04,288
ls it dangerous to touch an AlDS
patient? No need of a risk.

774
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:15,642
So, since now l should die
bit by bit! No. l will kill myself.

775
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:23,442
But why should l? Before my
death l will fu** a hundred girls.

776
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:31,217
l will spread this disease to
them. No one can defeat me.

777
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:42,369
What am l saying? How cruel l am?

778
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:46,204
Will you be there with me, Abu?

779
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:52,372
You have gone?

780
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:56,411
l don't know what to say you?

781
01:25:57,118 --> 01:25:59,382
l don't want to hear
any thing from you.

782
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:06,150
Why are you staying
here? You can ago.

783
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:10,394
lt happened as you prayed.
Aren't you Happy now?

784
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:17,663
Now who will produce my film?

785
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:24,001
So that's your problem!
You don't care about me.

786
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:31,680
l will say, your movie will be
a big flop. Leave me. Go.

787
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:35,612
l can't leave you alone.

788
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:37,821
l said go.

789
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:39,652
Please!

790
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:40,384
Go.

791
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:54,642
Roshan! Please open the
door. l will be with you.

792
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,919
Open the door please!

793
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:18,160
l will kill every one.

794
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,370
Dam it!

795
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:25,890
l enquired. That Anita
George was committing suicide.

796
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:50,346
Hey! Stay. Stay there!

797
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:55,260
Actually l have stopped smoking.

798
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:58,626
Father told me that this
is against our believes.

799
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,931
l can understand you.
But why are you lying to me?

800
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:07,598
l can't tolerate that.

801
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:09,869
This disease can be
carried only through body fluids.

802
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:14,674
lt will never harm others if we mingle
with others or shared the food.

803
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:18,080
Your science will say
like that now. lf they..

804
01:29:18,252 --> 01:29:19,378
- change that condition tomorrow?

805
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,546
Science makes new
inventions every day.

806
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:27,591
Hey! Stay there. l'm coming.

807
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:28,960
Here it is.

808
01:29:39,273 --> 01:29:40,069
Hi Anjali!

809
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,004
Hi.

810
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:47,074
l'm checking out alone.
Now itself. l will pay the bill.

811
01:29:48,349 --> 01:29:49,782
Hey Jo!

812
01:29:54,555 --> 01:30:00,790
l stopped every
thing with Ann. We broke up.

813
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,051
What happened?

814
01:30:02,497 --> 01:30:07,628
How did you managed to
love her forthree years.

815
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:11,029
l will award you for that.

816
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:17,244
No one can spend
even three days with her.

817
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:24,578
Jo, let me say one thing.

818
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:27,412
ln this generation no
one will love sincerely.

819
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,823
We can't trust these girls.

820
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:37,625
But, this girl, she is different.
l'm an expert in this case.

821
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:38,864
She is worthy.

822
01:30:39,867 --> 01:30:43,803
Don't miss her.

823
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:46,930
So, all the best my friend.

824
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:47,932
Yes.

825
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:50,967
See you at the channel.

826
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:54,113
One another girl friend of
mine is waiting for me.

827
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:04,486
Thanks Anjali. Bye.

828
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:05,215
Bye.

829
01:31:31,385 --> 01:31:32,977
l want to ...

830
01:31:34,055 --> 01:31:35,454
Tell me!

831
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:42,155
You are so beautiful Anjali.
Guys will like you very much.

832
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:44,361
Really? Thank you.

833
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:50,664
Between you two...
Sorry, l didn't get you.

834
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:58,371
Jo and Anjali...
No. Nothing like that.

835
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:03,011
After you brake up Jo was so sad.

836
01:32:03,384 --> 01:32:06,615
So l just tried to help him.
We are just friends.

837
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:10,122
Are you sure?
Very sure.

838
01:32:11,993 --> 01:32:12,891
Thanks.

839
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:15,756
Thanks for what?
Just like that.

840
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:42,620
Can l sit?
Sure. Sit.

841
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:58,405
Peter leaved me.
l knew that. l feel sorry for you.

842
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:05,508
l did a big mistake to you.
That's over.

843
01:33:05,646 --> 01:33:08,809
Sure? ls there any
more scope for me?

844
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:11,375
What do you mean?

845
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,360
Can't you forgive me? Can you give
me one more chance please?

846
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:29,062
Why are you laughing
like this? Do you hate me?

847
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:40,778
At that moment l did really mean it.
But that moment is gone.

848
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:46,443
What did you think
about relationships?

849
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:52,224
ls this a bulb which lights
when the switch is on?

850
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:56,456
How fast are you changing?

851
01:33:58,366 --> 01:34:05,238
You take your own time. l will
wait. We were so nice together.

852
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:12,072
Don't touch me. l hate you.
Now get lost.

853
01:34:22,123 --> 01:34:24,819
So you trapped him.

854
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:26,224
What?

855
01:34:26,394 --> 01:34:27,918
Now don't act as if you
don't know anything.

856
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:13,365
''Like this moon light
Like this moon light''

857
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:21,672
''Did you lighten
yourself in this world!''

858
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:27,907
''ln the dream world
like a light of life.''

859
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:36,751
''ls there a honey
sweeter than love?''

860
01:36:37,324 --> 01:36:48,360
''Did the heart weep
to taste that honey again?''

861
01:37:01,248 --> 01:37:12,284
''Like this moon light
Like this moon light''

862
01:37:13,694 --> 01:37:20,896
''Did you lighten
yourself in this world!''

863
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:27,706
''ln the dream world
like a light of life.''

864
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,027
Roshan!
Yes!

865
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:09,234
Who is this Anita George?
l will tolerate anything.

866
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:14,710
But this... You are
cheating me Roshan.

867
01:39:16,317 --> 01:39:18,581
lf this was an
ordinary arranged marriage,

868
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:23,415
l will not be hurt like this
But this was original love!

869
01:40:17,211 --> 01:40:20,874
Today l saw her after six months.

870
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:24,874
Maya?

871
01:40:28,088 --> 01:40:28,645
Yes.

872
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:40,024
But she didn't see me.
A guy was with her.

873
01:40:40,267 --> 01:40:42,201
Did she marry him?

874
01:40:42,469 --> 01:40:43,663
lf so l will kill her.

875
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:52,878
Actually l too saw her
with that guy one or two times.

876
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:59,516
Leave it. Every thing is over.

877
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:04,616
Over? l'm waiting for
herto forgive me.

878
01:41:05,192 --> 01:41:08,320
Don't talk foolishness. l don't
think that she will return to you.

879
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:10,726
No girl can tolerate to you.

880
01:41:11,765 --> 01:41:13,130
When you was bored
with eating rice at home,...

881
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:14,325
- you ate biriyani from outside.

882
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:17,532
When you become bored on that
too you started eating new things.

883
01:41:17,771 --> 01:41:19,966
When your wife knew this
you lost your rice at home.

884
01:41:20,107 --> 01:41:20,801
Stop it.

885
01:41:21,942 --> 01:41:26,106
Ok, are you eligible
to ask her to come back?

886
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:29,272
And for what if she comes back?

887
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:31,707
You are an HlV
infected person now.

888
01:41:32,553 --> 01:41:36,080
. Where are you going?
To create problems there?

889
01:41:36,356 --> 01:41:37,380
Ok, l will come with you.

890
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:51,765
Who allowed you to come here?

891
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:56,307
This is a usual dialogue uncle!
Can't you say some thing new?

892
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:00,739
Where is she?

893
01:42:06,453 --> 01:42:07,112
Who is he?

894
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:07,753
Who?

895
01:42:07,921 --> 01:42:11,152
l saw every thing. With
whom you are hanging out?

896
01:42:11,425 --> 01:42:13,484
So you found a new one?

897
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:19,399
Watch your words. But, what is the
relation between us to ask me this?

898
01:42:19,733 --> 01:42:22,531
You are my wife.

899
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:25,338
Every thing will be over with a sign.

900
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:27,497
Divorce notice will
come to your home.

901
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:29,699
We will see in the court.

902
01:42:30,511 --> 01:42:36,313
You don't want me? l'm serious.

903
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:43,753
lt's all over. You
should better leave now.

904
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,927
Now uncle will say'
get out from here'.

905
01:42:48,128 --> 01:42:49,493
Get out from here.

906
01:42:51,298 --> 01:42:59,535
The same thing. What a pity! Cut!

907
01:44:42,809 --> 01:44:43,673
Stop.Stop.Stop.

908
01:44:44,144 --> 01:44:46,612
ls the hero dying
of Aids in the climax

909
01:44:47,347 --> 01:44:49,406
People are coming
to theaters to enjoy.

910
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:52,416
lf this is the climax it is not certain
about the success of the film.

911
01:44:54,388 --> 01:44:55,514
He is right.

912
01:44:56,723 --> 01:44:59,419
But this can happen in real life.

913
01:45:00,661 --> 01:45:03,653
Any thing can happen in real life

914
01:45:05,065 --> 01:45:10,298
l have invested my
full money for this movie.

915
01:45:10,804 --> 01:45:13,136
lt's better to re shoot the climax.

916
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:16,640
l invested the money
by selling my mothers property.

917
01:45:16,877 --> 01:45:19,004
At the end of the movie 'Thalavattom'
Lalettan is dying.

918
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:20,473
But the movie is a supper hit.

919
01:45:20,614 --> 01:45:22,241
ln that case the director is Priyadarshan and...

920
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:24,544
- the hero is our Lalettan.
That's a big difference.

921
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:26,881
lt will be safe to re shoot the climax.

922
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:29,352
There are several
movies done like that.

923
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:31,721
At the end hero and
heroine should join together.

924
01:45:31,892 --> 01:45:33,655
The movie should
be of happy ending.

925
01:45:33,794 --> 01:45:36,058
l made you my producers.
That's my first mistake.

926
01:45:36,229 --> 01:45:38,060
Then we acted ln that.

927
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:48,733
Ok. l will re shoot. The
producer's decision is the final one.

928
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:50,072
Sure.

929
01:45:55,649 --> 01:45:57,378
Let's see the new climax.

930
01:46:08,995 --> 01:46:10,462
Do you feel to suicide?

931
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:34,584
You feel very sad when
you see some one with me

932
01:46:35,422 --> 01:46:38,949
Then, have you ever
thought about my mind when...

933
01:46:39,526 --> 01:46:42,256
- l knew your countless relations?

934
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:49,502
No one is there for me now.
l have plenty of time to think!

935
01:46:51,304 --> 01:46:56,003
l can understand now.
l'm sorry for every thing.

936
01:46:58,378 --> 01:47:02,872
What happened to you?
Are you not well?

937
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:07,883
Maya, l'm too late.

938
01:47:12,492 --> 01:47:15,689
Now you look like an Aids patient.

939
01:47:24,504 --> 01:47:30,374
My dearfriend. You sold forgive me.

940
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:33,375
lt's time to reveal the
suspense of this story.

941
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,390
F***!

942
01:47:52,666 --> 01:47:56,033
Aren't there any men in the
family? l mean in the vehicle.

943
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:04,202
What were the dialogues!
Viagra has no side effects.

944
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:46,448
Dear, Anita George is not dead.

945
01:49:14,648 --> 01:49:17,116
You dirty director!

946
01:49:17,751 --> 01:49:22,711
This is Saniya. My would be.
lt's arranged by our family.

947
01:49:27,327 --> 01:49:28,294
Now, tale end.

948
01:49:36,303 --> 01:49:38,999
Let me see if l can
shoot with out a camera man!

949
01:49:40,106 --> 01:49:44,167
Hello, and welcome to love
and lost. This is me Anjali Menon.

950
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:22,164
Hello Roshan!
Hello Alice!

951
01:51:22,308 --> 01:51:25,402
How are you?
l'm fine.

952
01:51:25,645 --> 01:51:26,805
Ok, then?

953
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:32,977
Don't we want to go to Goa
once more in the real mood?

954
01:51:33,253 --> 01:51:33,844
What?

955
01:51:50,200 --> 01:52:34,826
