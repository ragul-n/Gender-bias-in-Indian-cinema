00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:48,141
''Let's go, go ... Hurry man!!''

2
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:55,747
''Hey, was that the tyre!!?
- No, he's shooting at me! Hurry up!!''

3
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:58,784
Hey, Start the car!

4
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,682
''Hurry up ... move, move!''

5
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,989
It's not starting.
Push the car.

6
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,091
Hang on ...it's starting.. there we go!

7
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,731
What's happening?
Who's he? Who are you?

8
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,364
I'm just a simple man.
PIease save me!

9
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,431
Then why is he shooting at you?
- I don't know.

10
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:24,173
''Dude, is this some mafia nonsense?
I'II get screwed along with you!''

11
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,242
See that jeep behind us -
pIease go in that!

12
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,712
Is that him?

13
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,378
Oh god!

14
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:41,159
''Dear lord!
Hey, do you know the Hanuman prayer?''

15
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,857
Gayatri mantra?
- I don't.

16
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,863
''Dude, sing any hymn you know!''

17
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,168
Now I lay me down to sleep...

18
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,435
We're dead meat!

19
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,539
''If I die before I wake,
I pray the lord my soul to take...''

20
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,368
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

21
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:01,972
Go away! Don't follow me!
You'II get me kiIIed.

22
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,548
Shoo!
- Stop!

23
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,354
Shoo! Get lost!
- PIease buddy!

24
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,687
''Don't follow behind me!
- Please, Sir!''

25
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,210
Hey, get out from here!

26
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:49,962
Whoa! You again? Buzz off!

27
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,659
''Please..., Taxi!
Please... Don't leave me, Taxi.''

28
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,734
''Quick, call the cops!''

29
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,600
''Good morning, Sir.''

30
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,603
Welcome... Some tea?

31
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,381
Here...

32
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,383
Welcome...''How's life, Ghanshyam?''

33
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,783
You? Here?

34
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,991
Hey, Call your wife.
Tell her you've been kidnapped.

35
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,360
Two million - cash. Got it?

36
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,600
But...
But what?

37
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,798
You borrowed money;
and you didn't return it on time.

38
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:35,666
''Circuit, I'd said ''point the gun'',
not ''shoot it all over Mumbai!!''

39
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,192
What if someone get shot?

40
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,835
Chill out bro!

41
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,707
They're fake bullets...
they just sting!

42
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:51,999
''Hey, Flo Jo, at this range even a fake
bullet can do the job! What?''

43
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,921
Who are you people?

44
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,400
Didn't they tell you. We're social workers.
'Loan-default Prevention Specialists'.

45
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:00,863
You owe him 2 million:
Just pay up and Go home.

46
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:06,664
''But Manilal, this is wrong. You know, i've paid to
your brother in time.''

47
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:10,499
My brother swindled half the city
and fled to Dubai.

48
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:16,208
I don't care what deal you
guys had - I want my money.

49
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,311
But, it was you
who asked me to pay to him!!

50
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,453
I don't care!
I want my money back.

51
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,650
Hang on...
You paid back to his brother?

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,321
Yes. Ask him.
- What does he care...?

53
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,823
Quiet!

54
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:37,297
''Dude, you made a very big mistake.''

55
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:39,967
''Ghanshyam, go home.''

56
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,843
''Take this, and call your wife.
- But... why?''

57
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,176
''Hey, don't fuse my 'circuit' or...''

58
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,884
You'll be riding home
in three different bags!

59
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:59,918
''Tell your woman to send 1 million,
because you've been kidnapped.''

60
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,793
One million? For what purpose?!

61
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:06,927
Because you pay me to do dishonest job,
that's why...

62
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:11,300
''My father says, ''Don't be dishonest,
and don't tolerate dishonesty.''

63
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,937
''Now, call your wife!''
Now!!

64
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,012
Grab him.
- Yes brother.

65
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,251
Quiet!

66
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,262
''Telegram for Murli Prasad Sharma (Munna Bhai)!
- Open it, quick!''

67
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:40,693
When?

68
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,700
''The evening train, brother.
- Damn! We're screwed!''

69
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,372
''Aalam, call Banwari! Move it!!''

70
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,965
''The boss's old man is coming,
by the 5 o'clock train...''

71
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,971
What?!
- But he always comes in July...?

72
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,306
Fool! He's not the monsoon.
He can come whenever he like.

73
00:06:55,549 --> 00:07:01,200
The Boss's (Munna Bhai) dad is coming!
5 o'clock!

74
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:05,915
''C'mon, hurry up!
Move it! We don't have time!''

75
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,290
''You're still a rookie, child.''

76
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,426
Sorry...Forgive me...
It was on the floor...

77
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,528
I was returning it...
I'm not a pickpocket.

78
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,561
Bloody thief! Pickpocket!
Let's beat him!

79
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,837
See how they're beating
the poor thing.

80
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,508
What are you doing?
Make way!

81
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,948
What are you doing? Leave him!
Why are you beating him?

82
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:13,519
''He stole from me, why are
all of you getting excited?''

83
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,818
I wiII beat this man.
Come with me!

84
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,523
''You don't know these ruffians, sir.
- Let us at him, we'II teach him!''

85
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,190
''WeII, shouId I...?
- No.''

86
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,894
Do you know who they are?

87
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,031
These are the peopIe of our country.
Look at their faces.

88
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,767
Someone's fought with his wife;
another's son won't Iisten to him.

89
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,106
''One's jeaIous of
his neighbour's success,''

90
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:36,332
and one has had it
with his IandIord's demands.

91
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:40,169
From the government's corruption
to the cricket team's defeat...

92
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,279
they're upset about everything.

93
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:47,987
''But their anger is siIent, bottIed up.
They'II pour it out on you.''

94
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,650
ShouId I hand you over to them?
They'II definiteIy crack your skuII!

95
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,985
No! Forgive me sir! I made a mistake!

96
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,025
Can't see them brother...
- Keep looking.

97
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,166
''AIright everyone,
he's Iearned his Iesson.''

98
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,696
Thank you for your heIp.

99
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:13,110
''Son, it's simpIer to live honestIy.
Understand?''

100
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,383
Namaste.
- BIess you.

101
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,752
Namaste.
- Good... God bIess...

102
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,381
What the heII are you doing here?
- You know him?

103
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,758
He...no..no..

104
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:27,759
Porter!

105
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:32,595
You're hurt.
Come... our son is a doctor.

106
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,999
''The boss's old man has arrived !!!

107
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,403
Let's go!
Hurry! Hurry!

108
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:45,608
Hey... you! Bring me down...

109
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:00,154
Hey... I'm hangin' here!!
Put the ladder back! HeIp!

110
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,238
Wow! A new signboard?

111
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,165
''Yes. Was put up right after we
got the teIegram.... This way, Ma'am.''

112
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,108
''Go ahead, read it.''

113
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:23,246
''Read it quickIy, I want to meet my son.
Fine! I'II read it.''

114
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,646
'Hari Prasad Sharma CharitabIe HospitaI'

115
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,284
That's his name. Happy?

116
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,624
Read your name?
Let's go in.

117
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:35,325
Even my son ran away from the viIIage.

118
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:42,265
''But, unIike you, he worked hard and
became a doctor. Let's go.''

119
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:47,607
It's what we feared -
Lymphosarcoma of the intestines.

120
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,942
''Doc, wiII I Iive?''

121
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:56,111
''Yes, because onIy Dr.MurIi Prasad Sharma
knows the cure for this disease.''

122
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,348
ReaIIy?

123
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,445
''Father, you're here!''

124
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,718
''God bIess you, son.''

125
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,717
How are you Ma?
- Fine. How are you?

126
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,491

127
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,526
''Great? He works day and night,
ignoring his own heaIth.''

128
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:15,764
That's my son! SeIfIessness is
the sure way to heaven.

129
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:16,934
''Thanks, father.''

130
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:20,640
''Oh, and Iook at this chiId -
he's bIeeding.''

131
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,972
The doctor wiII fix you up.

132
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,972
You...? A doctor?!

133
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:35,184
''Dr. Lohanna, it's a deep cut -
an emergency - fix it!''

134
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,351
But...

135
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,687
Don't worry. Dr. Lohanna wiII
deaI with him.

136
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,031
You must be tired. Go rest.

137
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,063
Seeing you makes us Iess weary.

138
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,199
Shhh... Quiet!

139
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,501
What happened?
- They're punching...

140
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,672
Stitching... him up. It's painfuI.

141
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,015

''Shut up! Remember, Brother's a doctor!''

00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:31,242
''Sorry madam, if money couId save Iives
then the rich wouId never die.''

145
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,614
''Circuit, heIp the Iady.
- Huh!? ...Yes, doctor.''

146
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,283
Madam...

147
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,384
But I...
- PIease come with me.

148
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,111
Don't worry.
Everything wiII be fine

149
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:50,163
Her husband was so obese
that i have to remove his fat by operation...

150
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,154
Is this aII of it?
- Yes

151
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,197
ChiII sis! Go sit in the car.
He'II be right out.

Goddamn rodent! Beat it!

154
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,807
You carry on son.

155
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,805
''Hey, didn't we meet the Iast time too?''

156
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,475
Are you ok?
- No it's...

157
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,947
I'm ... I'm...

158
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,853
''Dr.Monty,

159
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,564
''Nurse, get me the chIoroform.''

160
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,236
What?

161
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:38,240
You over-acting piece of crap...

162
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,576
''Look at him, what a naturaI!''

163
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,045
He's been acting for three years and
father's never recognised him.

164
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,255
''Get up, jerk! You're cured.
Now, get out!''

165
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,290
What the heII is going on?

166
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,320
It's a Iong story! Scram!

167
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:15,271
''Brother, if it hurts you so much...''

168
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:22,287
...why don't you just teII
your father the truth?

169
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:30,723
''TeII him, in this city a don gets
more respect than any damn doc.''

170
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,534
He'II die if he gets to know...

171
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,372
''Its just seven days of drama, Circuit.
Let it be.''

172
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,416
''Ma, remember when I saw a ghost
near the cemetery?''

173
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,419
And it was Chandu who was sIeepwaIking.

174
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,855
And father had raised his cane...

175
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,684
''FooI! Why did you go
near the cemetery?''

176
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,193
I was so scared.

177
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,034
Scared? You were shaking!

178
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,407
And you hugged me...
And I feIt nothing couId scare me

179
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,203
You used to caII it something...?
- The Magic Hug!

180
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,070
The Magic Hug!

181
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,251
Get up.
- What...?

182
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,488
Do as I say.

183
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,961
Come here.

184
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,400
''Now teII me, what's bothering you?''

185
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,502
''Ma, if I wasn't a doctor...''

186
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,169
What are you two up to?

187
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,304
''Nothing father. Just nostaIgia,
about the viIIage...''

188
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,978
So come back. You are so famous
in the viIIage today.

189
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,778
''The naughtiest kid who became
a big doctor in the city!''

190
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,283
''He wasn't the naughtiest.
- Ah, right.''

191
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:05,820
''It was I who stoIe fruits,
set fire to peopIe's trousers... right?''

192
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,935
'Morning sir!
- 'Morning... What's going on?

193
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,704
''Oh, nothing.
They're Ioony bins. How's the Doc?''

194
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,976
He's fine. How much for a coconut?

195
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,542
WouId I ever accept
money from you?

196
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,880
''WouId you Iike one with water,
or a creamy one?''

197
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,149
Neither...if it's free.

198
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,214
PIease don't do this!
- Ok ...I'm off!

199
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,546
''Stop, sir! I was kidding. PIease...''

200
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:37,388
A coconut pIease.

201
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,182
Fifteen bucks for a creamy
one and ten for water!

202
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,396
''Excuse me, do I know you?''

203
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:50,067
''I don't know about that, but
I certainIy know you, Dr. Asthana.''

204
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,369
Mr. Sharma!
- Correct!

205
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:03,582
How are you Mr. Sharma?
- You know each other?

206
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,247
Of course. When we finaIIy
got a hospitaI...

207
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,620
he was the first doctor
to come to the viIIage.

208
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:11,289
''He stayed for two years!
- Yes, but you, here?''

209
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,192
My son Munna has a hospitaI here.

210
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,356
Munna's hospitaI?
- Yes.

211
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,460
I don't understand.
- You don't need to.

212
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,993
Which coconut wouId you Iike?
- HoId on.

213
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,395
Munna's a doctor??

214
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:27,671
''Remember, I had toId you my son
wouId become a doctor someday?''

215
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:31,341
You did sir... now shouId
I cut a cream coconut?

216
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,006
Hang on.

217
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:37,011
''Surprising...I Iive near by,
and I don't know of this hospitaI.''

218
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,045
Forget about it! What's that
got to do with my coconuts? You...

219
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,717
Damn you and your coconuts.
Stop it I say.

220
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,728
Lets go to my house.
- Sure.

221
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:55,725
''So, you say your son's
hospitaI is cIose by?''

222
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,761
But I know aII the doctors around...
- Bananas?

223
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,553
''This standing around,
Iaughing IoudIy... what is that?''

224
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:18,950
Laughter therapy.

225
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:24,390
''If you're tense, or angry,
you Iaugh IoudIy...''

226
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,593
it Iowers the bIood pressure.

227
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,596
But how do you Iaugh when you're tense?
- Practice!

228
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,802
''Look at me. The angrier I get,
the harder I Iaugh''

229
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,400
PIease sit.

230
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,809
PIease get another cup.
- Right away.

231
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,413
So where did Munna get
his M.B.B.S. degree from?

232
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,378
I don't know.

233
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,620
He was in high schooI when
he ran away from home.

234
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,856
It was my fauIt - I was too strict.

235
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,188
I wanted him to be a doctor...

236
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,687
but he kept fIunking.
- I remember.

237
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:59,898
I was so scared that he wouId
become a criminaI...

238
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,896
''but fifteen years Iater
he caIIed and said,''

239
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,234
Father I've become a doctor.

240
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,108
I can't express the joy I feIt.

241
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:13,901
Tea.

242
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,311
''Mr. Sharma, good things
happen to good peopIe.''

243
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,920
And how's your daughter Chinki?
- Good.

244
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,957
What does she do now?
- She's a doctor.

245
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:34,659
Is she married?
- I'm stiII Iooking for a groom -

246
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,662
''she insists on getting married
onIy to a doctor, someone she knows.''

247
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,538
She's right.

248
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,804
''WeII, there is a doctor
Chinki's known as a chiId.''

249
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:48,178
''Co-incidentaIIy,
I have his photo right here.''

250
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:55,585
What do you say?

251
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:03,426
Marriage! Not for me!
It'II be a big probIem.

252
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,624
Fine. Lets go Parvati.
- Where?

253
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:13,495
To our viIIage! No one there negates
their parents' wishes so merciIessIy.

254
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:18,373
What is aII this? Mom...
- He's right.

255
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,037
My poor IittIe heart
had just one Iast wish...

256
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,509
...to pIay with my grandkids.

257
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:28,048
Looks Iike I'II die without that joy

258
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:32,046
''You're making a mountain out of
a moIehiII. Circuit, expIain to them!''

259
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:38,825
''Sir, you see...''

260
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:44,465
Brother is so busy 24/7...

261
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,672
the wife wouIdn't understand the
pressures of running the hospitaI...

262
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,143
''UnIess, of course,
she was a doctor herseIf.''

263
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:56,743
That's true. OnIy a doctor can
understand a doctor's pressures.

264
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,878
ExactIy. Father...

265
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,656
Why are you smiIing Iike that?

266
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,692
Mom? You too?

267
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,826
We've found a Iady doctor for you.

268
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,825
And you have an appointment
with her tomorrow.

269
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,963
What doctor?!

270
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,428
Chinki.

271
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,173
Chinki! What kind of name is that?

272
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,508
Hang on...That Chinki?!

273
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,221
Brother how is Chinki to Iook at?

274
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,220
''Like, reaIIy pretty?''

275
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:46,230
''WeII, when we were kids, she was a
fatso with two oiIed pigtaiIs,''

276
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,263
...and a perenniaI running nose.

277
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,604
We pIayed together a Iot.

278
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,396
''I'd be the doctor,
and she'd be the wife.''

279
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:58,775
''I'd go to the cIinic,
she'd stay home and cook.''

280
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:03,646
''WeII then, marriage sounds
Iike a good idea.''

281
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,251
''Use your head, Circuit!''

282
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,947
In two days she'II see right
through this doctor drama!

283
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,983
''Just say, ''Dude, I'm not a doctor.
So bite me!!''

284
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:16,928
You taIk Iike a doofus sometimes.
Why shouId I ruin her Iife?

285
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:23,301
''But Brother, something has to be done.
- You're right...''

286
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,970
Something must be done.

287
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,341
''Chinki! Munna's phone caII, for you.''

288
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:32,109
Munna?

289
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,638
''Go on, taIk to him.''

290
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:44,354
''Dad, do you mind?
- No, I don't mind.''

291
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,359
TaIk niceIy with him.
- OK dad.

292
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,955
''I'II speak niceIy,
I'II marry him niceIy...''

293
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,397
''we'II have nice IittIe chiIdren,
and they'II caII you grandpa.''

294
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,393
''Now, some privacy pIease?''

295
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,835
''HeIIo, Chinki?''

296
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,335
''Good morning, doctor.
You're an earIy riser.''

297
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:05,676
No. I haven't sIept aII night.
- Why? Was there an emergency?

298
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,512
Damn straight! I'm up shit creek
and sinking fast.

299
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,149
Why are you Iaughing?
- You're taIking funny.

300
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:17,984
It's how I speak.

301
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:23,388
''Fine, Iet's taIk your taIk then...
Wassup?! Gimme the dope on your Iife.''

302
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:26,058
''The buzz is you're a doc now, dude...''

303
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:29,425
''I'm not a doctor.
- Like, I know.''

304
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:32,430
Say what?
- I've known you for ages.

305
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:37,241
''You were a IittIe ruffian,
and you're stiII the same, bro...''

306
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:41,909
''I'm not a ruffian, babe!
I'm a sociaI worker.''

307
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,445
''I provide financiaI heIp, get it?''

308
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,446
Munna! Do you taIk Iike
this to your patients as weII?

309
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:51,154
''Patients?! I'm serious, Chinki,
I'm not a doctor.''

310
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:55,152
I don't have time to expIain.

311
00:24:55,595 --> 00:25:02,467
''When I come over, you reject me -
say I'm ugIy - anything.''

312
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:08,467
''And pIease, make sure my father doesn't
find out - if he does, he'II die.''

313
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:14,138
''Gotta go. Reject me, OK?''

314
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,316
Your mother has bought
this for you.

315
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:26,849
You'II Iook regaI in it.

316
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,056
''Hurry, your mother's ready and waiting.''

317
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:42,566
''Lakshmi, get the sugar separateIy
from the tea.''

318
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:44,770
What happened?

319
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:48,914
Someone owes you money?
- Money?

320
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,951
Wanna kidnap someone?
- What?!

321
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,786
Wanna have someone roughed up?
- What nonsense!

322
00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:58,351
Then why is this photo here?

323
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:00,855
This is Chinki's
prospective bridegroom.

324
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:04,153
She's marrying that gangster -
Munna!?!

325
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:23,274
What happened?

326
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,809
''Chinki, go to the hospitaI.''

327
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,985
But... isn't Munna coming?
- I forgot to teII you.

328
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,657
It's postponed tiII next week.
- But dad...

329
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,889
''Hurry up, fast!
I have some work here.''

330
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:47,363
''Good morning, sir.
- Shut up, man! I Iook Iike a dork!''

331
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:51,437
Now Iisten - caII me every
5 minutes with an 'emergency'.

332
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:55,780
''If I'm not out in 20, get me out.''

333
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:59,308
''ChiII, Brother. Chinki's on it,
she'II reject you.''

334
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:00,977
''HeIIo, sir.''

335
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,314
''Let's go, son.''

336
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:19,067
See? Laughter therapy.

337
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:22,737
''Yes, he must be nervous.''

338
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:37,255
''Munna, where did you get your
M.B.B.S degree?''

339
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:44,158
Doctors' degree...

340
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:49,164
Err... Dongri MedicaI CoIIege.

341
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:55,500
What is your speciaIisation?

342
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,040
''Hands? Feet? Bones?
Or, just...the throat?''

343
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:09,378
''Is everything OK? No stress, no mess?''

344
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:13,825
''Right, put him on gIucose, and
caII me if there's an emergency, OK?''

345
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:15,216
Right.

346
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:24,030
Your parents are very proud of
your achievements.

347
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:30,273
Do you feeI proud too?
- No. I'm just a humbIe man.

348
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:33,542
You're not proud?

349
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:37,947
''Then are you ashamed, doctor?''

350
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,463
''TaIk to me. Come on, answer me.''

351
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:56,767
When you see pride and happiness
on their faces...

352
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:00,233
''do you feeI ashamed, 'Brother' Munna?''

353
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:09,280
No answer...
Looks Iike there is a probIem.

354
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:12,315
''Let's go, father.
I'm not interested in Chinki.''

355
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:16,452
You are not interested in her?!
Who are you. What are you?

356
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,751
She's a doctor.

357
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:22,554
Do you know a doctors status!

358
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,222
''Father, Iet's go!''

359
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:28,434
''Sir, pIease be forthright.
What are you impIying?''

360
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,263
''Sure, Sir.''

361
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:37,171
Your son is a mobster.
He kidnaps peopIe for money.

362
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:42,011
''If you knew this, then
you're a bigger fraud than him;''

363
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:46,615
''and if you didn't know,
then you're the biggest fooI on Earth!''

364
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,353
Enough!

365
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:51,387
That's it.

366
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,087
Munna... is this true?

367
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:09,708
''You are a doctor, yes?''

368
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:40,433
''Sir, I beg your forgiveness.
I spoke too soon.''

369
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,605
Doctor! The patient in no. 4
has fainted. Hurry!

370
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,897
At Ieast wear your turban.
- How can I?

371
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,897
Munna has stripped us of our dignity.
- But he's our son. Forgive him.

372
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:17,902
''Enough, Parvati! It takes a Iifetime
to earn respect...''

373
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:22,244
and your son.... Let's go.

374
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:40,763
He has never stepped out
without his turban.

375
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:54,847
Why did you do this Munna?

376
00:31:57,651 --> 00:31:59,516
''I was afraid, Ma.''

377
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:02,986
''After years, when I spoke to him...''

378
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:06,985
''I thought he'd say ''How are you?''

379
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:10,824
''Instead, he asked,
What do you do in Mumbai?''

380
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:15,361
''I hope you aren't a
no-good ruffian or crook.''

381
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,100
''I was scared, Ma.''

382
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:21,531
''Without thinking I said,
I'm a doctor.''

383
00:32:33,486 --> 00:32:34,976
''Stop him, Ma.''

384
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:39,591
He won't stop.

385
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:56,136
Ma... give me a 'Magic Hug'...

386
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,575
''Parvati, Iet's Ieave!''

387
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:39,311
What did I teII Chinki?
I don't want to marry you.

388
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:44,182
''Just Iet's not upset my father.'' Right?''

389
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:47,087
Correct.

390
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:50,062
You want to do something about it...
- No.

391
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:53,564
''She's a chiIdhood buddy,
and a doctor too.''

392
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:58,501
''You know,
onIy doctors are respected?''

393
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:03,942
''We don't deserve respect,
onIy doctors do.''

394
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,543
BIoody.... Hey!
Don't touch the signboard.

395
00:34:13,153 --> 00:34:16,088
My father's name is on it.
Hands off!

396
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:17,855
CaIm down.

397
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:20,258
Bastards! Don't you dare!

398
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,600
My oId man cried.

399
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:35,307
''He'd never cried, and I made him.''

400
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,444
''Brother, we aII cried.''

401
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:42,647
You know why?

402
00:34:43,716 --> 00:34:47,379
Because I'm not a doctor.

403
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:50,355
I've upset everyone.

404
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:07,131
''Circuit, I'm gonna be a doc too.''

405
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:13,279
''Brother, Iets taIk about it tomorrow.''

406
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:17,341
I knew you'd say that...
that I'm sIoshed...

407
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:20,218
I'II forget by tomorrow...

408
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:26,282
''Brother, forget it. What's the point?
- The point?''

409
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:31,729
I'II become a doctor
and marry Chinki.

410
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:36,935
And that Dr. Asthana... you don't
know what he said.

411
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:40,433
''I was there,
and I was siIent.''

412
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:45,106
I'II show him! I'II be a doctor!

413
00:35:46,913 --> 00:35:51,282
''Circuit, find out, which is
the best medicaI coIIege in Mumbai.''

414
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:00,726
Out of the way!

415
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:29,087
I'II ask this guy.

416
00:36:29,556 --> 00:36:31,490
''Hey, 'Safari Suit'

417
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:34,859
''Whom does one see for admission?
- FiII the form, over there.''

418
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:37,691
Who's the patient?
- No one.

419
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,931
Then who's to be admitted?
- Brother.

420
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:41,700
What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

421
00:36:41,968 --> 00:36:43,697
Then why admit him?
- He wants to be a doctor.

422
00:36:43,903 --> 00:36:45,165
Who?
- Brother!

423
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:47,339
He's taIking about me!

00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:51,239
''Yeah, right. And I want to
become the heaIth minister.''

425
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,637
BIoody jerk-off!

426
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,313
''Enough of your crap.
Now, whom do we meet?''

427
00:36:58,017 --> 00:37:02,852
You want to become doctor...

428
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:04,889
What's a 'dean'?

429
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:08,559
''Errr...the headmaster, Iike,
a coIIege principaI.''

430
00:37:08,962 --> 00:37:11,590
He's in charge of admissions.
- Where is he?

431
00:37:11,998 --> 00:37:13,693
''In the Operation theatre, upstairs.''

432
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:27,104
Who's the dean here?

00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,599
You want admission?
What were your H.S.C. scores?

436
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,299
Say what?
- High schooI...

437
00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:57,203
How much did you score?
- How much do you need for admission?

438
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,707
At Ieast ninety percent!
- That's what I got.

439
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:03,582
Right. We'II have a certificate

440
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,478
''OK, then you must sit for a
pre-medicaI entrance exam.''

441
00:38:07,086 --> 00:38:10,021
''If you pass, you're in.''

442
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:13,016
''But, who wants admission?''

443
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:17,453

00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:33,335

450
00:38:42,522 --> 00:38:46,583

451
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:51,129

452
00:38:51,564 --> 00:38:54,124
''Dump the tension, dude.

453
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:56,967
''Hey pops, the black one.

454
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:07,541
''Hey Rusty,
your dad's nuts about the queen.''

455
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,178
This is wrong!

456
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:12,612
''Dump the tension, dude.
Your dad is with us.''

457
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,780
Go and take my exam.

458
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:20,420
''Go confidently, like Brother Munna.

459
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:23,694
''You're asking for it, stooge.
- Oh my!''

460
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,696
''Brother, he's a duffer.

''Doc, get a move on. I don't

00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,868
It's only an Entrance Exam.
So quit your moaning.

Put him in a taxi! Move On!

00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:19,977
''Pops, why are you after the queen?''

469
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,354
Because she is mine!

470
00:40:27,627 --> 00:40:30,755
''Done, sir.

471
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:48,176

''Ooh! What's your name, dude?''

493
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:05,741
''Brother Munna, M.B.B.S.!''

494
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,645
My degree's A1

495
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:46,314
Tops!

496
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:48,252
Say what?

497
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:54,454
''My bride's gonna be hot, hot, hot''

498
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,862
Love wiII be aII around

499
00:45:02,502 --> 00:45:06,097
Our hearts wiII beat and pound

500
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:10,100
We wiII be the worId's envy

501
00:45:10,577 --> 00:45:14,206
''But we won't care, because, you see''

502
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:20,383
''This dream, our dream,''

503
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:26,250
''won't break, break, break!''

504
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,560
''Oh! What's your name, dude?''

505
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:30,522
''Oh! What's your name, dude?''

506
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:33,727
My name? You haven't heard yet!?

507
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:37,964
''Brother Munna, M.B.B.S.!''

508
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:11,002
''Hey, move this stuff, man!
Move it, make it quick, man!''

509
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:34,218
''Ten or twenty bypasses a day -
no tension!''

510
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:36,720
''Too easy, bro!''

511
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:42,391
''I'II forget eat and drink -
no tension!''

512
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:50,109
In doIIars wiII be my pay

513
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:54,307
The waIIet wiII sing everyday

514
00:46:54,948 --> 00:46:58,440
I'II dance and make the others too

515
00:46:58,952 --> 00:47:02,046
They'II do the disco in a pink tutu

516
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:06,653
''We wiII find our Eden, and hey''

517
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,391
A new song it'II be everyday

518
00:47:10,797 --> 00:47:14,699
''To cooI bars, in new cars,''

519
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:18,634
We wiII make our merry way

520
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:24,735
''The girIs
Oh with their IoveIy curIs''

521
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:30,479
''WiII be weIcome
For a free heart check, check, check!!''

522
00:47:31,051 --> 00:47:32,814
''Hey! What's your name, dude?''

523
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,144
''Hey! What's your name, dude?''

524
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:38,149
My name? You haven't heard yet?!

525
00:47:38,925 --> 00:47:42,190
Brother Munna MBBS!

526
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:01,175
''Brother, eat your meaIs on time.
- And write to us.''

527
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:05,776
Is this a bride's send-off?!
- But... we'II miss you.

528
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:08,117
''HandIe these Ioonies, Circuit.
- Carry on, Brother.''

529
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:10,550
Move it 'Drama Company'... March!

530
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:29,705
''Hey, what's wrong with him?
- Attempted suicide - he ate poison.''

531
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:32,277
Then why is he Iying here -
take him inside!

532
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:34,513
His mom has stiII to fiII the form.

533
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:37,782
PIease hurry!

534
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:43,948
Doc... He's dying.
Do something.

535
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:46,282
Sorry. Take him to CasuaIty.
I'm off duty.

536
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:50,996
'Off duty'? He's dying in front
of you - what the heII is 'off duty'!

537
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:55,025
''For an 'attempted suicide' case,
a poIice form must be fiIIed first.''

538
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:00,432
What if I 'attempted murder' you -

539
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,700
''wiII the hospitaI save you or
fiII a form first, huh?!''

540
00:49:06,379 --> 00:49:07,573
CarefuI.

541
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:11,307
Over here.

542
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,352
PIease wait here.

543
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:18,084
Is he your boy?
- Yes.

544
00:49:18,425 --> 00:49:21,826
Dump the tension. They'II get
aII the junk out of him in no time.

545
00:49:22,562 --> 00:49:23,961
''Who are you, dear boy?''

546
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:27,062
MurIi Prasad Sharma. First year.
Entrance exam topper.

547
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:32,027
''I gotta run to cIass.
If the doc bugs you, caII me.''

548
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:34,201
Keep working on him Doc!

549
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:51,748
What?

550
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,959
Where is the first year cIassroom?
- Why?

551
00:49:55,762 --> 00:49:56,990
What 'why'?

552
00:49:57,564 --> 00:49:59,293
Why are you Iooking for the cIassroom?

553
00:49:59,566 --> 00:50:02,501
Because I'm Iate.
- For what?

554
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:07,898
The cIass. Today is my first day.
- But what wiII you do in the cIassroom?

555
00:50:08,908 --> 00:50:10,603
I'm a student.

556
00:50:12,645 --> 00:50:13,669
Student?

557
00:50:13,913 --> 00:50:17,110
Entrance exam topper....
Where's the cIass.

558
00:50:22,622 --> 00:50:25,887
Where's the cIass.
- You're a student?

559
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:31,156
I'II teII you what...
what's your name?

560
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:35,266
Dr. Suman.

561
00:50:35,802 --> 00:50:38,202
''Dump the tension,
I'II find the cIassroom myseIf.''

562
00:50:41,674 --> 00:50:44,404
''Where's the first-year cIass?
- Straight, then Ieft...''

563
00:50:53,165 --> 00:50:54,860
Good Morning sir!

564
00:51:10,148 --> 00:51:11,046
What's up?

565
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:35,800
I Iike to teII you...

566
00:51:37,175 --> 00:51:42,511
The country's best doctors
have studied in this very haII.

567
00:51:43,181 --> 00:51:46,173
They sat on these very benches.

568
00:51:46,919 --> 00:51:49,353
Just Iike you are sitting.

569
00:51:49,755 --> 00:51:52,588
''Circuit, you had to seIect
this coIIege, didn't you!''

570
00:51:53,258 --> 00:51:59,720
You shouId be proud that you are to be
a part of the 150-year-oId institution.

571
00:52:00,165 --> 00:52:02,565
''He's right here,
yapping about something.''

572
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:11,573
Which one of you wants to
be a good doctor?

573
00:52:20,018 --> 00:52:21,952
Do you think you'II be
a good doctor?

574
00:52:25,457 --> 00:52:28,551
''Why, what's speciaI about you?''

575
00:52:31,663 --> 00:52:34,598
I beIieve I can feeI
the patients suffering.

576
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:38,264
''I want to treat them as friends,
not just as patients.''

577
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:48,268
In my 25-year career I haven't
befriended a singIe patient.

578
00:52:49,381 --> 00:52:54,318
''I have not feIt their pain,
just cured it.''

579
00:53:14,906 --> 00:53:17,306
See this hand...Rock steady.

580
00:53:18,844 --> 00:53:23,679
''It's done thousands of operations,
but it never shook.''

581
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:30,719
''But if I were to operate on
my daughter, it wiII shake for sure.''

582
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:36,359
Why? Because I Iove my daughter.

583
00:53:38,463 --> 00:53:43,366
''Friendship, empathy, attachment-
these are weaknesses for a doctor.''

584
00:53:46,004 --> 00:53:48,404
For the next five years...

585
00:53:49,574 --> 00:53:57,345
''...you'II be taught that a patient
is just a sick body, nothing eIse.''

586
00:54:07,793 --> 00:54:12,526
If someone is dying outside the CasuaIty
Ward is it necessary to fiII a form?

587
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,872
Your cIasses start tomorrow at 8:00 AM.
Thank you very much.

588
00:54:39,558 --> 00:54:41,890
I don't get it!
How did he get so far?

589
00:54:51,636 --> 00:54:54,537
''Dad, it's OK!
Why do you get so excited?''

590
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,873
I am not excited!
Do you know who he is?

591
00:54:58,577 --> 00:55:00,477
A thug! The don of our area!

592
00:55:02,914 --> 00:55:04,176
Hang on...

593
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,517
''he hasn't seen you here, has he?
- Yes, he did.''

594
00:55:09,755 --> 00:55:11,313
Did he recognise you?

595
00:55:12,491 --> 00:55:15,324
Of course not.
He's never seen me before.

596
00:55:19,631 --> 00:55:22,122
He shouId never know that
you're my daughter. Understand?

597
00:55:24,736 --> 00:55:26,897
Nobody shouId know that Suman
is my daughter!

598
00:55:36,081 --> 00:55:38,606
''Brother, why do you want
to Iive in the hosteI?''

599
00:55:39,684 --> 00:55:41,879
''Excuse me bro, where is no. 12?
- Right here.''

600
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:48,624
What the...! This room
ends before it begins.

601
00:55:49,161 --> 00:55:53,291
Do you know why God sent me
to this particuIar coIIege?

602
00:55:54,065 --> 00:55:55,999
God certainIy didn't teII me.

603
00:55:56,401 --> 00:56:01,600
''God said, ''Go, settIe the score
with the man who made your father cry.''

604
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,866
''Right said, Brother.''

605
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:05,271
''You've discussed it with God,
then it's settIed.''

606
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:07,371
''FeIIas, move the stuff in.''

607
00:56:07,712 --> 00:56:11,648
''Brother, I say we move this waII and
take over the next room -''

608
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:15,317
we'II get more space here.
Keep the TV on the tabIe.

609
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,315
''Brother, Iets break this waII too -
we'II move the neighbour and...''

610
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:22,318
''buiId you a nice, big bathroom,
jacuzzi...Here.''

611
00:56:22,894 --> 00:56:24,862
Keep the bags down.

612
00:56:25,263 --> 00:56:28,664
''Yo, buzzy-bee, move your bag.
The air conditioner goes there....''

613
00:56:31,203 --> 00:56:32,363
''Refrigerator, here.''

614
00:56:32,804 --> 00:56:35,364
''Brother, watch how
I jazz up this room.''

615
00:56:36,808 --> 00:56:38,935
Excuse me.
WiII you stay here as weII?

616
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:42,405
''Yes, I'II sIeep in the fridge.
Shut up!''

617
00:56:42,814 --> 00:56:46,750
''Dump the tension, Circuit.''

618
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:49,548
''Yo, buzzy-bee, come here.''

619
00:56:52,824 --> 00:56:55,315
What's your name?
- Nagarajan Swami

620
00:56:55,827 --> 00:56:59,695
''Look Swami, reIax! Grab a coId drink,
watch TV, and enjoy.''

621
00:57:00,232 --> 00:57:02,393
What is mine is yours...
except for my underwear!

622
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:17,774
''Strip, then I'II teII you.
- Look, ragging is not aIIowed!''

623
00:57:18,283 --> 00:57:21,946
Of course it's aIIowed.
Who said it isn't? WaIk this way...

624
00:57:32,264 --> 00:57:33,458
Shake it baby!

625
00:57:41,072 --> 00:57:43,006
''Doctors, introduce yourseIves!''

626
00:57:44,943 --> 00:57:47,605
''I'm Dr. P.P. Ashok.
- Hey, bIack undy, come on!''

627
00:57:50,849 --> 00:57:52,077
Dr. Mahesh KripIani

628
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:54,875
''No, no, pIease! My pants!''

629
00:57:55,387 --> 00:57:57,412
Hey! Is this ragging?

630
00:57:59,891 --> 00:58:00,983
I'm Dr. AniI Davda

631
00:58:01,226 --> 00:58:03,160
This is fun.

632
00:58:04,863 --> 00:58:07,832
''Hey, I wanna do this too.''

633
00:58:10,101 --> 00:58:12,035
I'm Dr. MurIi Prasad Sharma.

634
00:58:26,985 --> 00:58:28,919
What eIse?
- That's enough.

635
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,915
Ragging's over.

636
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,924
Hey 'dispensary'! Cut the crap.

637
00:58:34,492 --> 00:58:37,928
''Brother said to rag him,
means you rag him.''

638
00:58:39,497 --> 00:58:41,931
''Hey Swami, you rag'em.
I wanna watch.''

639
00:58:43,234 --> 00:58:45,668
''Dump the tension, dude... I'm here.''

640
00:59:16,067 --> 00:59:20,163
Have some chickpeas - they're
good for your bones. Lots of caIcium.

641
00:59:21,439 --> 00:59:23,999
Let me study. I came second
in the entrance exams.

642
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:26,707
How do you think
I got the first pIace...?

643
00:59:27,112 --> 00:59:29,012
By eating chickpeas. Have some.

644
00:59:39,124 --> 00:59:42,059
''I asked a question yesterday,
you haven't answered yet.''

645
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:45,795
C'mon dude!

646
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:51,431
How can a dying man be
expected to fiII a form!

647
00:59:51,903 --> 00:59:54,497
''And if he dies whiIe fiIIing it,
who's responsibIe?''

648
00:59:56,808 --> 00:59:57,706
Say what!

649
00:59:58,009 --> 00:59:59,567
Get out!
- Why 'get out'?

650
01:00:00,211 --> 01:00:04,147
''I topped, and I paid the fees -
I ain't going nowhere!''

651
01:00:08,386 --> 01:00:11,321
If this man doesn't Ieave at once...

652
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:14,950
then there wiII be no more Iectures
on Anatomy this year.

653
01:00:18,263 --> 01:00:19,491
Munna! Go!

654
01:00:19,831 --> 01:00:21,196
Go! Go!

655
01:00:24,803 --> 01:00:26,532
Fine. Fine! I'II Ieave.

656
01:00:26,805 --> 01:00:29,535
Why shouId anyone eIse Iose out.

657
01:00:34,312 --> 01:00:36,644
''Hey Swami...pay attention,
and teach me Iater.''

658
01:00:38,316 --> 01:00:40,216
Gimme the chickpeas!

659
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,584
''Dump the tension, dude.
Have some chickpeas.''

660
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,254
''No? CooI, more for me.''

661
01:00:59,705 --> 01:01:02,230
''Circuit, man, I reaIIy twisted
the dean's knickers today.''

662
01:01:02,675 --> 01:01:04,575
He got pissed-off and
asked me to get out!

663
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:11,407
''I said, ''Why get out? I've paid
my fees.'' He was about to cry!''

664
01:01:12,685 --> 01:01:15,950
Why are you making a racket?
- Why shouIdn't I?

665
01:01:16,689 --> 01:01:19,624
It's my father-in-Iaw's coIIege;
I'II get it as dowry.

666
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:22,957
Why aren't you in cIass?
- My dear father-in-Iaw...

667
01:01:23,296 --> 01:01:26,163
''J dot Asthana, threw me out.''

668
01:01:26,732 --> 01:01:30,293
''He's pissed-off, because I topped.''

669
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,670
You must have done something!

670
01:01:32,972 --> 01:01:36,464
''I just asked a simpIe question,
he toId me to beat it.''

671
01:01:37,043 --> 01:01:40,376
''Both father and daughter are the same-
you speak poIiteIy, and...''

672
01:01:40,713 --> 01:01:42,374
What did she do?

673
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,273
I made a smaII request:
that she keep quiet.

674
01:01:45,718 --> 01:01:48,050
But she's Iike her father.

675
01:01:49,188 --> 01:01:52,055
She busted me in front of my parents.

676
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:56,985
''Hang on, what's your name?''

677
01:01:58,764 --> 01:02:01,699
Dr. Suman...dump the tension.

678
01:02:02,168 --> 01:02:05,296
It's a Iong story- some other time.
Gotta go now.

679
01:02:07,773 --> 01:02:10,037
''Like I was saying,
the baIdy was aII fIustered.''

680
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:13,704
This is the beginning.
You just wait and watch what I do.

681
01:02:17,617 --> 01:02:22,554
''First, starting from the neck,
make an incision down the centre.''

682
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:33,760
Ew! It stinks!

683
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:39,667
Out of the way! I can't see.

684
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,201
Why don't you get a body of your own.

685
01:02:56,322 --> 01:02:57,789
Who's that?
- Your pop

686
01:02:58,257 --> 01:03:02,785
Brother! How are you?
- Look, I need a body.

687
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:10,499
''Body? Whose body?
- Like, for dissection.''

688
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,562
''Brother, where do I find such a body?''

689
01:03:14,006 --> 01:03:16,201
How wouId I know?
Just find one.

690
01:03:16,943 --> 01:03:18,843
''Dump the tension, Brother.
You concentrate on your studies.''

691
01:03:19,278 --> 01:03:22,042
I'II look for the body.
Dump the tension...

692
01:03:24,951 --> 01:03:26,680
Brother! I found a body.

693
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:29,544
Will the imported one do?
- Yeah. Just get it quick.

694
01:03:29,956 --> 01:03:31,423
''10 minutes, i will come in 10 minutes..Brother.''

695
01:03:32,358 --> 01:03:35,225
''Butkya, get a sack.
- Right away.''

696
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:45,936
''Yo, chilly chicken, wanna take an
ambulance shot?. It's a 5-star model.''

697
01:03:53,045 --> 01:03:55,946
''Poor, hungry people -
They are inside the ambulance.''

698
01:03:59,051 --> 01:04:01,417
''Bloody hakka noodle,
you all come in from abroad...''

699
01:04:01,654 --> 01:04:04,248
''and you all only see naked, hungry people.
You don't see Taj Mahal?''

700
01:04:06,726 --> 01:04:08,318
''Will this bag do, brother?''

701
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,466
How will he fit inside this?
Have i need to fold him? How tall are you?

702
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:19,971
''Get a 6-feet bag
You, come with me.''

703
01:04:20,206 --> 01:04:24,000
You don't want to see Taj Mahal, huh?
Ok, I'II show you hungry Indian, very hungry..Get Inside!

704
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:25,339
''Very nice. Get in, son of a...''

705
01:04:38,557 --> 01:04:41,025
''Brother, check it out,
we've got the body.''

706
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,062
Absolutely fresh.

707
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,399
Where did you find him?

708
01:04:52,672 --> 01:04:54,572
He was standing
right outside the house, when you call me.

709
01:05:01,113 --> 01:05:02,546
It's a ghost!
- You?

710
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,898
What was I have to do?

711
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:28,368
''There are 50 students to a body,
you can't see diddly-squat!''

712
01:05:28,874 --> 01:05:31,775
All I've seen in 4 days
is the fingers. What's going on inside the hand, i dont know anything...

713
01:05:33,212 --> 01:05:37,114
''I wanna be a complete doctor,
not a finger specialist...''

714
01:05:37,616 --> 01:05:40,141
...who doesn't know what's up
with the knees.

715
01:05:42,888 --> 01:05:45,152
''And he's the one that said, ''get your own body''.''

716
01:05:48,227 --> 01:05:50,161
''He wants a body to himseIf,
so give it to him.''

717
01:05:50,463 --> 01:05:52,693
He wishes to learn.
So, What's wrong with that?

718
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:04,465
''Now, please show me... heart,
kidneys, lungs, intestines.''

719
01:06:09,315 --> 01:06:15,185
It's not a dagger.
Hold it like a pen. Take your time.

720
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,596
''Admit him, and let him know
that I've filled in his form.''

721
01:07:12,975 --> 01:07:14,408
He's conscious.

722
01:07:18,981 --> 01:07:20,881
''Brother, what happened to you?''

723
01:07:21,984 --> 01:07:26,318
Nothing. I didn't eat last night...

724
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:29,583
woke up earIy for the dean's lecture...

725
01:07:31,026 --> 01:07:32,960
and I forgot to have breakfast....

726
01:07:34,463 --> 01:07:38,365
And there was water
on the marble fIoor...

727
01:07:38,901 --> 01:07:41,961
''Nobody cleans up around here...
It's very dangerous, Ms. Suman.''

728
01:07:42,404 --> 01:07:44,304
It happens. Rest.

729
01:07:47,509 --> 01:07:50,672
''How are you now?
- I'm fine, ma'am. How's our hero?''

730
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:57,609
I don't know what to do. This was his
second attempt at suicide.

731
01:07:58,821 --> 01:08:00,755
And he won't talk to anyone.

732
01:08:04,059 --> 01:08:06,289
''Dump the tension, ma'am.
Where is he?''

733
01:08:09,064 --> 01:08:11,794
''Your mom is crying in front of you,
aren't you ashamed?''

734
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,000
Don't scold him.
- Why not!

735
01:08:16,104 --> 01:08:18,595
''You wanna die?
Then do it right, finish it.''

736
01:08:19,174 --> 01:08:22,041
Sleeping piIIs are a haIf measure.

737
01:08:22,511 --> 01:08:25,378
Take a knife to your throat
and slit it.

738
01:08:26,114 --> 01:08:30,642
''TiII then, don't pity yourseIf.
- I don't pity myseIf!''

739
01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:33,544
''MurIi, Iie down.
- Hang on, Ms. Suman.''

740
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:36,386
Kids today don't
have an ounce of courage.

741
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:42,092
''And you've spoiIt him, ma'am,
hanging on every teardrop of his.''

742
01:08:42,564 --> 01:08:45,692
He has to toughen up.
- PIease be quiet.

743
01:08:46,268 --> 01:08:48,759
You don't know what I've been through!
- What?

744
01:08:49,872 --> 01:08:53,103
FaiIed your exams?
Got dumped by a girI?

745
01:08:53,642 --> 01:08:55,542
Strapped for cash?

746
01:08:57,145 --> 01:08:59,409
''A girI! Got dumped, right?''

747
01:09:04,353 --> 01:09:08,414
''Hey, Circuit, who'd marry
such a cry baby?''

748
01:09:09,157 --> 01:09:11,751
Was out to kiII himseIf
over a six-month romance.

749
01:09:12,294 --> 01:09:17,061
Your mom's Ioved you for years;
can't you stay aIive for her?

750
01:09:19,201 --> 01:09:23,137
What do you know about Iove?
- True.

751
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,841
''What does a goon Iike me
know about Iove,''

752
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:33,512
Loaf around to kiII time

753
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:38,986
''Eat and drink, five to nine!
I'm fine!''

754
01:09:40,255 --> 01:09:43,986
So why faII in Iove? Why?

755
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:50,630
''But then one day,
Sophia waIked my way''

756
01:09:59,207 --> 01:10:04,577
''My head was in a strange condition,
my heart revved without ignition''

757
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:14,616
''Dude, what a face!! ...
and whatchamacaIIit ...''

758
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:20,326
yeah - tresses! What tresses!

759
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:26,466
She moved Iike the wind...

760
01:10:28,403 --> 01:10:32,032
''traffic stopped
if her eyes just bIinked''

761
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:36,934
''I thought I'd found my home, said''

762
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:40,347
''Dude, I found my Iove,
my church in Rome!''

763
01:10:51,093 --> 01:10:52,856
''AII day I'd stand
underneath her window''

764
01:10:53,095 --> 01:10:54,790
''No fights, no brawIs''

765
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,064
''No squabbIes with Aziz,
no scraps with Usman...''

766
01:10:57,532 --> 01:10:59,864
I was numb!

767
01:11:03,005 --> 01:11:05,473
She was the one...

768
01:11:05,907 --> 01:11:08,375
you didn't whistIe...

769
01:11:14,282 --> 01:11:16,807
''at the one, our eyes met...''

770
01:11:17,285 --> 01:11:19,412
you didn't wink at

771
01:11:25,527 --> 01:11:27,461
''My buddies Iooked Iike
they'd been bombed''

772
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:30,598
''Said, Dude, pIease don't teII us
you've reformed!''

773
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:45,505
''Then one day KaIIan
saw her and said''

774
01:11:45,881 --> 01:11:47,508
''Woah! Look!
She's a perfect eIeven!''

775
01:11:47,749 --> 01:11:49,512
I Iost my head...

776
01:11:53,255 --> 01:11:54,313
and said...

777
01:11:54,589 --> 01:11:56,682
''Come here punk,
I'II show you heaven''

778
01:11:57,292 --> 01:12:00,693
''He got washed,
rinsed and dry cIeaned that day''

779
01:12:01,029 --> 01:12:04,829
''StiII runs away Iike I'm
a bad omen, his doomsday!''

780
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:10,238
Then what happened to Sophia?

781
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:21,144
''Then one day,
she Iooked at me and smiIed''

782
01:12:22,684 --> 01:12:26,950
''I thought Dude, she smiIed,
my case is fiIed''

783
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:33,084
Thought she Iike me too

784
01:12:33,662 --> 01:12:38,565
''But she met someone eIse
and said ''I do'' ''

785
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:05,084
''She was married, it was undisputed''

786
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:08,590
''WhiIe I just stood there,
stricken and rooted''

787
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:11,999
That night I drank tiII 2 am

788
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:24,278
''Damn, I had but one dream,
one prayer''

789
01:13:24,646 --> 01:13:26,477
''But I swear I didn't shed
a singIe tear''

790
01:13:26,882 --> 01:13:30,079
Why cry? It was a stupid high!

791
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:35,346
''Next day it was back to Iife
back to reaIity''

792
01:13:35,891 --> 01:13:38,485
''Loaf around to kiII time; eating,
smoking, drinking wine!''

793
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:41,488
''CIashed with Aziz again,
nearIy kiIIed him too''

794
01:13:41,963 --> 01:13:44,295
''They said forget her,
but ''no can do''

795
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:57,976
''My dreams were shattered,
my heart was too''

796
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:03,513
''Yes it hurt..
but that's Iife, dude!''

797
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:17,721
Then ... then what happened?

798
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,430
''What couId happen?
Next day...''

799
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:23,634
PameIa waIked my way

800
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:36,144
''My head was in a strange condition,
my heart revved without ignition''

801
01:14:38,286 --> 01:14:40,413
''Dude, what a face!!''

802
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:45,159
''And oh, what eyes!''

803
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:49,528
''Hey Munna, did the traffic
in your heart just sigh?!''

804
01:14:57,906 --> 01:15:01,808
He has smiIed after so many days.
I think he'II be fine.

805
01:15:03,245 --> 01:15:05,145
It was nothing. Don't mention it.

806
01:15:05,714 --> 01:15:08,842
''MurIi, why do you bug everyone?''

807
01:15:09,317 --> 01:15:12,115
''It seems you're here to
irritate peopIe, and not to study.''

808
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,852
''Not everyone, just Asthana.''

809
01:15:15,657 --> 01:15:18,854
He and his daughter.... Never mind.

810
01:15:19,527 --> 01:15:22,121
Chinki is innocent.
She didn't even know.

811
01:15:24,966 --> 01:15:28,902
You know Chinki?
- Of course! She's a good friend.

812
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:31,295
It wasn't her fauIt.

813
01:15:31,539 --> 01:15:33,939
The maid toId her father.
What couId she do.

814
01:15:34,175 --> 01:15:39,374
No wonder! I kept thinking how a
chiIdhood buddy couId teII on me.

815
01:15:42,684 --> 01:15:47,951
''Ms. Suman, teII me,
Iike... How does she Iook?''

816
01:15:48,823 --> 01:15:49,755
Why?

817
01:15:50,091 --> 01:15:53,288
As a kid she was a big fatso! Now...?

818
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:56,591
AbsoIuteIy not!
I've seen her oId picture.

819
01:15:56,998 --> 01:15:58,932
She wasn't that fat.
- You're kidding me!

820
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:02,131
She once cIimbed a tree.
The branch broke!

821
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:09,768
''How is she now?
I mean, how does she Iook?''

822
01:16:11,146 --> 01:16:13,706
Not too bad.

823
01:16:14,049 --> 01:16:16,313
As good as you?

824
01:16:20,055 --> 01:16:22,148
Better than me.
- Woah!

825
01:16:22,557 --> 01:16:24,582
''Ms. Suman, you have to make
her meet me.''

826
01:16:24,993 --> 01:16:27,359
Dr.Asthana wiII kiII her.
- That son of a...

827
01:16:30,198 --> 01:16:33,690
''We'II meet secretIy.
You're her friend, pIease heIp.''

828
01:16:34,436 --> 01:16:35,368
Why?

829
01:16:36,237 --> 01:16:38,068
Say what?
- Why shouId I?

830
01:16:41,142 --> 01:16:45,078
Fine. But onIy if you promise not
to bug any of the professors.

831
01:16:45,513 --> 01:16:46,741
DeaI!

832
01:16:47,315 --> 01:16:48,714
I'II think about it.

833
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:57,151
Now observe cIoseIy.
Such interesting cases are rare.

834
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:01,356
The subject has been in this
condition for 12 years.

835
01:17:02,931 --> 01:17:07,834
''He can't speak, hear, understand,
or feeI anything.''

836
01:17:08,903 --> 01:17:14,068
His senses are all dead.
He's alive but also not alive.

837
01:17:15,243 --> 01:17:16,437
Now see...

838
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:22,445
''if you observe cIoseIy,
when I shine a Iight into the eyes...''

839
01:17:23,184 --> 01:17:26,449
''the pupiIs contract,
but the subject doesn't bIink.''

840
01:17:27,055 --> 01:17:30,616
''Yo, boss! HeIIo!
Turn off the torch!''

841
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:33,793
Why?
- That must cause him discomfort.

842
01:17:34,896 --> 01:17:39,390
Out of the question!
The subject can't feeI anything.

843
01:17:39,901 --> 01:17:42,028
Say what - 'subject'?
Doesn't he have a name?

844
01:17:47,275 --> 01:17:49,539
His name is Anand Banerjee.

845
01:17:49,911 --> 01:17:52,209
''And he's many years your senior,
taIk respectfuIIy about him.''

846
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:58,143
Why are you getting emotionaI?
I toId you he can't hear a thing.

847
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,146
''ReIax! Sit down.
- Munna, sit down!''

848
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:08,525
''In your medicaI careers, you'II face
this question many times.''

849
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:15,196
''TeII me, is it right to keep such
a human aIive by using medicines...''

850
01:18:16,004 --> 01:18:19,235
especiaIIy in a country where
there is a shortage of hospitaIs;

851
01:18:19,974 --> 01:18:23,239
the subject has been occupying a
bed for the Iast 12 years.

852
01:18:23,611 --> 01:18:24,942
Screw you!

853
01:18:25,814 --> 01:18:29,682
You're concerned about the bed!
How do you know he won't wake up?

854
01:18:30,318 --> 01:18:32,912
I'm a doctor.
- But not God.

855
01:18:33,655 --> 01:18:36,249
Did you get inside his head?
I shouId thwack you in the head.

856
01:18:37,358 --> 01:18:39,292
Leave the cIass!

857
01:18:41,429 --> 01:18:44,296
Say what you want.
Let's go Mr. Anand.

858
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:47,293
What are you doing?
Where are you taking him?

859
01:18:48,369 --> 01:18:50,098
''Brother Anand, don't mind him.''

860
01:18:50,472 --> 01:18:53,339
These docs read a coupIe of books
and think they're God.

861
01:18:53,942 --> 01:18:55,773
''If anyone gives you tension,
Iet me know.''

862
01:19:07,355 --> 01:19:10,620
12 years...that's a Iot of time.

863
01:19:11,726 --> 01:19:14,786
''You must be bored!
Hey Doc, gimme the headphones.''

864
01:19:20,869 --> 01:19:23,337
''Brother Anand, Iisten;
it's your heart!''

865
01:19:23,671 --> 01:19:25,502
What a soIid beat.

866
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:27,773
Listen.

867
01:19:33,581 --> 01:19:35,481
You are hundred percent aIive.

868
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:39,377
''If anyone disagrees make them hear
your heart's voice, OK?''

869
01:19:46,828 --> 01:19:48,625
''Yo, Circuit...''Do a favour for me...

870
01:19:49,497 --> 01:19:51,055
''AII right, right here.''

871
01:19:51,499 --> 01:19:55,094
''Hey, quit imitating a bedspread
and bring the bed out.''

872
01:19:56,704 --> 01:19:58,467
''And sir, he just took
the subject out of cIass!''

873
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:02,098
And you did nothing?
- ShouId I have wrestIed with him?

874
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:05,804
''Sir, he nearIy strangIed me.
I couId have died.''

875
01:20:07,882 --> 01:20:10,146
''And that ugIy street Ianguage
in the cIassroom - yo dude, Iike...''

876
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:13,149
''I just can't get this shit
into my head, man - What is this?''

877
01:20:13,488 --> 01:20:14,978
Is this some bIoody country bar?

878
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:18,487
''Do you know by what name
he caIIs us? ''Doofus''!''

879
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,488
''Yo, doofus,
out of the way! Move it!''

880
01:20:24,599 --> 01:20:27,033
''Sir, we aII want you
to rusticate him.''

881
01:20:29,003 --> 01:20:31,233
We can't do that.
- Why?

882
01:20:31,973 --> 01:20:34,874
On what pretext do we throw him out?
Because he asks questions?

883
01:20:35,343 --> 01:20:37,140
Or because he doesn't
speak too poIiteIy?

884
01:20:37,712 --> 01:20:39,646
He topped the pre-medicaI
entrance exams.

885
01:20:40,081 --> 01:20:42,140
We need a very strong
reason to rusticate him.

886
01:20:46,654 --> 01:20:49,919
''Yo, mop-boy, scoot.
Hey, 'safari-suit', make way!''

887
01:20:50,391 --> 01:20:53,588
Enjoying your stroII? Get to work!

888
01:21:00,635 --> 01:21:02,933
There's onIy one way out
as I see it.

889
01:21:03,671 --> 01:21:05,832
''Rustom, you wiII set this terms
question paper.''

890
01:21:06,274 --> 01:21:08,538
You'II set the toughest paper
in the history of this institution.

891
01:21:10,211 --> 01:21:12,611
''He'II faiI, and the next day we'II
hand him his Ieaving certificate.''

892
01:21:14,749 --> 01:21:17,343
''Munna's brought a bed, dude!
- What?''

893
01:21:22,423 --> 01:21:24,357
''Brought a bed, dude??
- He's brought a bed, sir!''

894
01:21:34,869 --> 01:21:37,702
''Brother Anand, dump the tension. Any
probIems, just teII Brother about it.''

895
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,703
''Brother, your father-in-Iaw!''

896
01:21:46,781 --> 01:21:49,113
May I ask what's going on here?
- No!

897
01:21:52,587 --> 01:21:53,713
OK.... OK. Ask...

898
01:21:54,722 --> 01:21:57,657
What the heII are you up to now?
- Doc Doofus here said that...

899
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:01,026
...brother Anand's bed couId be
better utiIized for another patient.

900
01:22:01,429 --> 01:22:04,694
''So, we've vacated it.
- We have no need for this bed.''

901
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,360
''It's not for you to sIeep on, doofus.''

902
01:22:09,971 --> 01:22:12,371
''Brother Anand,
this's your personaI bed.''

903
01:22:12,907 --> 01:22:16,399
SIeep easy. Nobody wiII bother you.

904
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,344
''Bye, brother Anand. Take it easy.''

905
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:45,465
CarefuI!
He hasn't shaved in 12 years.

906
01:22:46,441 --> 01:22:50,172
''Brother Anand, Iet's get you sIicked
and then out in the sun...''

907
01:22:50,645 --> 01:22:52,442
''get some, Vitamin D!''

908
01:22:52,747 --> 01:22:57,775
Tonda's going around saying that
Munna's out - caII me for work.

909
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,115
I can't study and work.

910
01:23:01,856 --> 01:23:06,793
There's so much stuff
in the body to know about?

911
01:23:07,295 --> 01:23:11,527
''To begin with,
there are 206 types of bones!''

912
01:23:12,433 --> 01:23:14,867
''Never thought of that
whiIe breaking them, did we?''

913
01:23:17,004 --> 01:23:18,904
Why aren't you in cIass?

914
01:23:19,307 --> 01:23:22,868
Because everyone keeps throwing me out.
- AII the doctors are angry with you.

915
01:23:23,211 --> 01:23:25,111
You've got to pay a IittIe more
attention to your studies ...

916
01:23:28,616 --> 01:23:30,550
HeIIo.... I'm taIking to you...

917
01:23:52,006 --> 01:23:53,940
Brother Anand
you Iook Iike a rock star!

918
01:23:54,442 --> 01:24:00,074
''The nurses are gonna fight over
you now. Let's go for a spin, brother.''

919
01:24:10,258 --> 01:24:14,922
That face behind a beard...
Heresy!

920
01:24:19,133 --> 01:24:20,498
''MurIi, stop!''

921
01:24:21,702 --> 01:24:26,002
''Look if you don't do weII,
they're going to throw out.''

922
01:24:26,074 --> 01:24:29,976
''Ok Iook, if you study, and pass
the exam, I'II arrange a meeting...''

923
01:24:30,245 --> 01:24:33,806
between you and Chinki.
- No probIemo. I'II pass!

924
01:24:41,089 --> 01:24:46,584
Pops... How are you?
- Come in. Carom?

925
01:24:47,196 --> 01:24:50,688
''PIay carom, drink juice ...
That's the good Iife, pops!''

926
01:24:58,106 --> 01:25:00,336
It's a reaIIy difficuIt paper man!

927
01:25:08,116 --> 01:25:11,051
AIimentary canaI...AIimentary canaI...
Got that? OK.

928
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:16,050
The answer to question number four
is 'spinaI cord atrophy induces...

929
01:25:20,162 --> 01:25:21,220
What...?

930
01:25:21,497 --> 01:25:25,763
SpinaI cord atrophy...
Hey keep it down!

931
01:25:26,168 --> 01:25:29,626
WiII you pIease... SiIence!
I can't concentrate man...PIease.

932
01:25:30,272 --> 01:25:35,141
''SpinaI, s-p-i-n-a-I, cord, c-o-r-d...''

933
01:25:48,991 --> 01:25:51,960
Done. Was reaIIy tough!
- Best of Iuck.

934
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:00,794
This boy is a genius.
If such guys become doctors...

935
01:26:01,203 --> 01:26:06,140
''...then patients wiII onIy hear
Dude, Iie down, you're screwed!''

936
01:26:07,676 --> 01:26:10,144
''Rustom, I want to know how he topped.''

937
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,844
''How wouId I know sir?
- Yeah, how wouId you know?''

938
01:26:14,249 --> 01:26:17,184
''Sir, you had caIIed MurIi Prasad Sharma.
- Send him in.''

939
01:26:19,655 --> 01:26:21,987
''So, Mr. Sharma,
you've topped again.''

940
01:26:22,324 --> 01:26:24,986
''Dude, your professors
sure know their job.''

941
01:26:25,394 --> 01:26:27,828
May I ask what you wish to prove here?

942
01:26:29,398 --> 01:26:32,231
''Ask away, dude!
- Who do you think you are?''

943
01:26:33,835 --> 01:26:35,962
Do you think I don't know that
you've cheated?

944
01:26:36,338 --> 01:26:38,238
''I don't know how,
but I wiII find out, Mister.''

945
01:26:39,341 --> 01:26:42,936
You think I've cheated?
Let me decIare that I have.

946
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:46,074
And wiII do it again.
Do what you can!

947
01:26:46,415 --> 01:26:49,680
Shut up! No one has ever spoken
to me Iike this!

948
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:51,882
There's aIways a first time dude!

949
01:26:52,087 --> 01:26:53,679
''You, you, you, you,....''

950
01:26:54,356 --> 01:26:58,019
Do you know I can throw you out
of this coIIege?

951
01:26:58,393 --> 01:27:01,260
Have you forgotten how I
threw your father out?

952
01:27:02,331 --> 01:27:07,598
How can I forget that? My father
cried in front of me and Ieft.

953
01:27:08,437 --> 01:27:11,929
Now it's your turn. You're going
to get screwed in your own coIIege.

954
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:15,075
''Not onIy wiII I become a doctor,
I'II aIso marry your daughter.''

955
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:17,774
That's my chaIIenge.

956
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,072
Do your worst.

957
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,694
I wiII screw him!!

958
01:27:34,429 --> 01:27:35,760
What am I saying?!?!?!

959
01:27:41,703 --> 01:27:46,072
''Ms. Suman, I topped again!
- MurIi, I'm busy''

960
01:27:46,942 --> 01:27:49,536
Dump the tension. I'II wait.

961
01:27:50,946 --> 01:27:53,210
Get these tests done.
- Thank you doctor.

962
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:57,550
''MurIi, you're...
- But I topped Ms. Suman!''

963
01:27:58,053 --> 01:27:59,611
I know. CongratuIations.

964
01:28:00,022 --> 01:28:02,855
PIease ask Chinki to meet me now.
- She won't meet you.

965
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:08,558
''Hey, you're breaking your promise.
- She's scared, Munna.''

966
01:28:08,964 --> 01:28:12,559
She wouId meet you but
Dr. Asthana is Iivid right now.

967
01:28:12,968 --> 01:28:15,698
''Dude, he's Iike the IncredibIe SuIk.''

968
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:17,900
Why doesn't someone just
give him a Magic Hug?

969
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:20,472
Hug?
- An honest hug is magicaI.

970
01:28:20,876 --> 01:28:23,572
My mom caIIs it the Magic Hug.
It's an anti-tension drug.

971
01:28:23,979 --> 01:28:27,244
''Hey, can't you see its wet there?''

972
01:28:29,017 --> 01:28:32,453
I sweep this pIace 25 times a day.
Am I a machine?

973
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:34,579
''I keep cIeaning,
peopIe keep waIking.''

974
01:28:36,358 --> 01:28:38,952
I'II die sweeping.

975
01:28:42,097 --> 01:28:44,531
''Hey, watch it...''

976
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,667
Sorry!
- What sorry?

977
01:28:47,069 --> 01:28:50,163
You'II mereIy waIk off but
I'II get yeIIed at.

978
01:28:50,972 --> 01:28:53,668
Like I've been yeIIed
at...for 30 years.

979
01:28:54,276 --> 01:28:56,938
What's your name?

980
01:28:57,879 --> 01:29:01,940
You want to compIain now?
The name's Maqsood.

981
01:29:02,718 --> 01:29:05,653
I don't want to compIain.
I want to thank you.

982
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:16,296
You're an awesome worker
Brother Maqsood.

983
01:29:17,032 --> 01:29:20,001
Everyone thanks doctors
for making them weII.

984
01:29:20,902 --> 01:29:24,463
No one thanks you for
picking up their rubbish.

985
01:29:25,907 --> 01:29:27,841
I just want to say thanks.

986
01:29:28,243 --> 01:29:29,210
Thank you.

987
01:29:42,057 --> 01:29:45,493
You're gonna make me cry. Enough.

988
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:58,565
Sorry!
- Forget it. I'II take care of it.

989
01:30:05,213 --> 01:30:07,681
TeII Chinki she shouId
give her dad a Magic Hug.

990
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:08,913
''I swear, he'II meIt Iike butter.''

991
01:30:16,057 --> 01:30:20,187
I've decided -
I'm caIIing Dubai!

992
01:30:21,096 --> 01:30:22,654
Dubai! Why?

993
01:30:23,098 --> 01:30:27,558
Brother Abbas can make
Munna disappear into thin air.

994
01:30:28,003 --> 01:30:30,335
Dad what are you saying?
Who is this Abbas guy?

995
01:30:30,739 --> 01:30:33,071
He came from Dubai to get
his hernia operated from me.

996
01:30:33,475 --> 01:30:37,468
''You know what he said to me? He said,
Brother Asthana, I owe you a hernia...''

997
01:30:38,146 --> 01:30:40,910
''...if you ever need heIp
just think of me.''

998
01:30:41,316 --> 01:30:43,250
These are men of honour.

999
01:30:49,357 --> 01:30:52,053
No dad! You're not cut
out for this stuff.

1000
01:30:52,494 --> 01:30:53,620
Yeah! I know...

1001
01:30:57,132 --> 01:30:59,600
''HeIIo!
- HeIIo Chinki, Munna here.''

1002
01:31:00,368 --> 01:31:01,835
Did Dr. Suman speak to you?

1003
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:08,670
I had sent a message through your
friend Dr. Suman. She's my buddy too.

1004
01:31:09,144 --> 01:31:11,612
What message?
- To give your dad a Magic Hug!

1005
01:31:12,113 --> 01:31:13,774
Is the doofus feeIing better?

1006
01:31:14,115 --> 01:31:16,049
Doofus!!...
He caIIed me 'doofus'!!

1007
01:31:16,384 --> 01:31:19,080
What's going on Munna?
- I topped again.

1008
01:31:19,554 --> 01:31:23,650
''It's turned into a habit.
- So, what do you want?''

1009
01:31:24,125 --> 01:31:28,994
You toId Dr. Suman that if
I do weII you'd meet me... Right?

1010
01:31:29,431 --> 01:31:31,092
''No, I can't meet you.''

1011
01:31:31,499 --> 01:31:34,991
''Hey Chinki,
it's wrong to break a promise.''

1012
01:31:35,437 --> 01:31:40,636
''Ok, fine. Tomorrow.
CIub Kino. Ten 'o'cIock. OK?''

1013
01:31:41,843 --> 01:31:44,471
My own daughter meets him.
I'II kiII him.

1014
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,538
I promise you won't hear
Munna's name after this.

1015
01:31:49,284 --> 01:31:50,512
Trust me dad.

1016
01:32:07,469 --> 01:32:09,562
''Brother, how wiII you
recognize her?''

1017
01:32:09,971 --> 01:32:11,905
''I wiII, I've known
her as a chiId!''

1018
01:32:20,482 --> 01:32:21,414
Munna!

1019
01:32:24,185 --> 01:32:26,119
Brother...Found her!
- Where?

1020
01:32:26,521 --> 01:32:27,954
Up there. In mid-air!

1021
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:45,604
''Munna, my baby, so sweet.''

1022
01:32:46,675 --> 01:32:49,405
Wow! You're Iookin' so good.

1023
01:32:51,346 --> 01:32:55,112
''Don't you recognise me...
Your chiIdhood buddy, Chinki?''

1024
01:32:55,517 --> 01:32:58,884
''It's she!
HeIIo Ma'am, I'm Circuit.''

1025
01:32:59,287 --> 01:33:01,847
''Circuit! As in, Iike, 'fused circuit'?''

1026
01:33:03,558 --> 01:33:05,492
''Oh my god!
- Hey Chinki, how are you doing?''

1027
01:33:05,927 --> 01:33:07,656
Andy. Hi....

1028
01:33:08,797 --> 01:33:11,288
''Hey, that's our number.
We got to hit the fIoor.''

1029
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:24,100
That bastard!
ShouId I naiI that chimpanzee?

1030
01:33:24,412 --> 01:33:25,344
''No, dude.''

1031
01:33:32,654 --> 01:33:35,589
''Come on, Iet's go.
- What, me too?''

1032
01:33:43,698 --> 01:33:46,292
''Who was that guy?
- Andy, my boyfriend.''

1033
01:33:47,102 --> 01:33:51,835
A boyfriend... that's freaky!
- Why? Don't you have a girIfriend?

1034
01:33:53,274 --> 01:33:57,108
Oh so sweet darIing.
Life is very short.

1035
01:33:57,545 --> 01:34:03,006
So we have to have fun.
Are you free on Saturday?

1036
01:34:03,451 --> 01:34:06,386
''Andy is going to New York,
so Iet's meet up.''

1037
01:34:07,389 --> 01:34:09,084
Meaning?
- Meaning...

1038
01:34:09,491 --> 01:34:13,120
''You and me, aIone!''

1039
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:18,460
''Chinki, you've changed a Iot, babe!''

1040
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:28,675
Oh god! You had to see his face.
It was too funny:

1041
01:34:29,477 --> 01:34:32,002
''Chinki, you've changed a Iot, babe!''

1042
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:35,105
''So you rocked, huh?
- Don't know about 'rocked'...''

1043
01:34:35,517 --> 01:34:37,178
but he was shocked for sure!

1044
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:43,721
Dad!
- I'm sorry. I had to hear it.

1045
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:47,094
''What did he say? Boyfriend...
- ''A boyfriend... that's freaky!!''

1046
01:34:49,831 --> 01:34:53,232
I was so worried. But you
did a fantastic job. WeII done

1047
01:34:53,635 --> 01:34:55,535
Are you OK now Dad?
- OK? I am very happy.

1048
01:34:55,937 --> 01:34:57,837
''But, ''A Boyfriend...
that's freaky!!''

1049
01:34:59,774 --> 01:35:05,713
''OK, enough. Poor guy!
- It's bad to make a mockery of someone.''

1050
01:35:06,815 --> 01:35:09,406
''But...
- ''A Boyfriend... that's freaky!!''

1051
01:35:13,267 --> 01:35:16,862
She was so sweet as a kid...
It's just ruined my memories.

1052
01:35:17,404 --> 01:35:20,532
Time changes everything MurIi.
- But how much.

1053
01:35:21,108 --> 01:35:23,201
She was morphing into
the guys when she danced.

1054
01:35:24,077 --> 01:35:28,673
And her dress?
It was so indecent.

1055
01:35:30,417 --> 01:35:35,514
Now Iook at you. You're a doctor.
So decent. One respects you.

1056
01:35:36,056 --> 01:35:40,049
She is the way she is.
You shouId just forget her.

1057
01:35:42,129 --> 01:35:44,893
''And whiIe you're at it,
forget about Dr. Asthana as weII.''

1058
01:35:45,332 --> 01:35:50,964
This war is futiIe.
- You're so sensibIe.

1059
01:35:52,172 --> 01:35:55,573
''You know, I aIways thought
she'd be Iike you.''

1060
01:35:56,143 --> 01:35:58,077
Even if she weren't as pretty as
you I'd dump the tension.

1061
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:05,047
''But your peacefuI styIe,
your friendIy smiIe...''

1062
01:36:06,086 --> 01:36:10,523
''But she...?
- But MurIi, I'm not Chinki.''

1063
01:36:12,459 --> 01:36:15,087
Why? Why aren't you Chinki?

1064
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:23,558
I aIways thought she'd be Iike you and
now I can't get your image off my mind.

1065
01:36:30,377 --> 01:36:32,140
''Your smiIe, your eyes...''

1066
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:34,512
What?

1067
01:36:35,015 --> 01:36:35,845
What?

1068
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:37,580
What did you say?

1069
01:36:38,452 --> 01:36:39,976
What did you hear?

1070
01:36:40,354 --> 01:36:44,814
''MurIi, didn't you just say something?
- No!''

1071
01:36:46,493 --> 01:36:48,085
I thought I heard something.

1072
01:36:48,495 --> 01:36:51,658
''I swear she heard me, brother Anand.
I didn't even move my Iips...''

1073
01:36:52,366 --> 01:36:57,030
and she knew what I was thinking.

1074
01:36:58,338 --> 01:36:59,896
''Is that possibIe, brother?''

1075
01:37:00,474 --> 01:37:02,965
''You know, this happens in Iove.''

1076
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:06,070
Circuit aIso says
if feeIings are strong...

1077
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,744
you can taIk Iong distance
cIearIy without a phone.

1078
01:37:09,383 --> 01:37:12,910
''So give me a signaI brother,
what do you think?''

1079
01:37:13,487 --> 01:37:15,421
Do you think I'm faIIing for her?

1080
01:37:18,492 --> 01:37:23,225
Correct. I think so too.

1081
01:37:27,534 --> 01:37:29,229
''Hey! Brother, Hey Doctor!''

1082
01:37:29,603 --> 01:37:33,130
Come quick.
Brother Anand spoke to me.

1083
01:37:33,573 --> 01:37:37,839
He heard me and bIinked at me as weII.
Just now. I swear by my mother.

1084
01:37:38,445 --> 01:37:43,075
''Do it again, brother, come on.''

1085
01:37:43,517 --> 01:37:46,953
''Mr. Sharma, he's never even
twitched in tweIve years.''

1086
01:37:47,354 --> 01:37:48,321
Shut up!

1087
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:52,720
''Brother, I know you're
Iistening to me.''

1088
01:37:53,593 --> 01:37:55,458
PIease try.

1089
01:37:55,996 --> 01:37:58,260
Give me a sign.

1090
01:37:58,699 --> 01:38:01,133
Show them they're wrong.

1091
01:38:05,605 --> 01:38:10,338
''OK everyone, Iet's get back to work.
You wait for your signaI.''

1092
01:38:14,715 --> 01:38:16,876
''MurIi, what now?''

1093
01:38:17,651 --> 01:38:20,620
Ms. Suman do you think
I'd joke about this?

1094
01:38:21,021 --> 01:38:25,151
I swear he bIinked.

1095
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:30,995
''MurIi, even though your voice reaches
his ears, it doesn't reach his brain.''

1096
01:38:31,465 --> 01:38:33,194
So what if it doesn't reach his brain.

1097
01:38:35,202 --> 01:38:38,262
It goes straight to the heart.

1098
01:38:39,506 --> 01:38:41,269
''Whether you beIieve it or not,''

1099
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:46,304
I say if there is a strong
connection between two peopIe...

1100
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:49,204
then it's the heart that Iistens.

1101
01:38:49,816 --> 01:38:51,784
You're too much.

1102
01:38:58,225 --> 01:39:01,160
''Ms. Suman, can you hear me?''

1103
01:39:04,664 --> 01:39:07,599
''Mike testing - 1 ,2,3...''

1104
01:39:09,603 --> 01:39:12,197
Ms. Suman I think
I've faIIen in Iove with you.

1105
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:38,397
HeIIo.
- Good Morning Dad.

1106
01:39:38,799 --> 01:39:40,391
''Oh, I met Dr. Desai's Son yesterday.''

1107
01:39:40,801 --> 01:39:44,066
He is aIso a doctor. Neurosurgeon.
Very good-Iooking feIIow.

1108
01:39:44,838 --> 01:39:46,738
I think you shouId meet him once.

1109
01:39:54,648 --> 01:39:55,512
Brother Munna!
- Munna?

1110
01:39:55,916 --> 01:39:58,441
Yes. He's got fIowers for you.

1111
01:39:58,852 --> 01:40:00,786
You get up. I'II handIe this. You go.
OK

1112
01:40:04,858 --> 01:40:09,886
''Hey Dean. Open the door!
- Yeah, yeah... caIm down...''

1113
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:18,297
Yes?
- For you.

1114
01:40:18,939 --> 01:40:19,633
Me?

1115
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:23,205
''Look, I want to apoIogize to you...
genuineIy.''

1116
01:40:27,914 --> 01:40:30,109
''Come in.
- No, Chinki's inside, right?''

1117
01:40:30,717 --> 01:40:32,412
Let's sit in the garden
for two minutes.

1118
01:40:32,953 --> 01:40:34,352
Why not? Sure.

1119
01:40:46,066 --> 01:40:51,197
''Look dude, I've created a Iot
of tension for you.''

1120
01:40:52,038 --> 01:40:55,530
Today I just want to say sorry.

1121
01:41:00,914 --> 01:41:04,350
No Munna. The fauIt was mine.
So what if you aren't a doctor.

1122
01:41:04,751 --> 01:41:09,347
You're a gem! I know you
want to meet Chinki.

1123
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:13,724
''Hang on ...Chinki!
- No, don't! I've met her.''

1124
01:41:14,761 --> 01:41:17,992
ReaIIy? You rascaI! So?

1125
01:41:20,033 --> 01:41:22,593
To teII you the truth
she's too wiId.

1126
01:41:23,069 --> 01:41:27,438
''I know she's a motherIess chiId,
but you ought to controI her a bit.''

1127
01:41:27,841 --> 01:41:28,967
You are right.

1128
01:41:30,076 --> 01:41:34,172
''But once you two are married she'II
reaIise her responsibiIities, right?''

1129
01:41:35,015 --> 01:41:35,777
Sorry boss.

1130
01:41:36,082 --> 01:41:41,679
I can't run a buIIdozer through my Iife
just because I want to buIIdoze yours.

1131
01:41:42,856 --> 01:41:44,790
''To marry, its important
to be in Iove, right?''

1132
01:41:45,091 --> 01:41:45,819
That's true.

1133
01:41:46,126 --> 01:41:49,687
''Dude, I have found true
Iove with someone.''

1134
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:51,028
How sweet.

1135
01:41:52,933 --> 01:41:55,094
I hope it doesn't break
poor Chinki's heart.

1136
01:41:56,069 --> 01:41:58,469
Why don't you teII her? Chinki!

1137
01:41:59,906 --> 01:42:01,703
''TeII her Iater, pIease!''

1138
01:42:03,009 --> 01:42:05,603
OK. Poor Chinki!

1139
01:42:07,981 --> 01:42:11,542
But I'm reaIIy
happy for you Munna.

1140
01:42:14,921 --> 01:42:19,790
''Go son, find your path,
the path of Iove. Be happy!''

1141
01:42:20,226 --> 01:42:22,717
''I misunderstood you.
You're quite cooI, dude!''

1142
01:42:23,129 --> 01:42:24,061
CooI!

1143
01:42:26,132 --> 01:42:29,863
May I ask who this
'fortunate' girI is?

1144
01:42:30,337 --> 01:42:33,272
''Ask, dude!
- You are bIushing. How sweet.''

1145
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:35,434
You're shy!
Who is she?

1146
01:42:39,546 --> 01:42:41,480
''Dude, you can't teII a souI.''

1147
01:42:42,248 --> 01:42:45,809
It's Dr. Suman. I'm gonna marry her.

1148
01:43:02,069 --> 01:43:05,129
So happy!
- I knew you'd be happy.

1149
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,834
''You're cooI, man. I gotta run now.''

1150
01:43:20,054 --> 01:43:21,851
''Ms. Suman, what happened?''

1151
01:43:22,256 --> 01:43:24,952
ExactIy what did you teII Dad?
- Whose dad?

1152
01:43:25,359 --> 01:43:27,554
''Chinki's dad, Dr. Asthana.''

1153
01:43:27,995 --> 01:43:29,895
Damn! He just can't keep
his trap shut.

1154
01:43:30,297 --> 01:43:32,629
Like you. Why did you say
those things to him?

1155
01:43:33,034 --> 01:43:36,526
Correct. Instead of Chinki's oId man
I shouId've spoken to your oId man...

1156
01:43:37,338 --> 01:43:40,273
...I mean... your father.
- No! You shouId've spoken to me first.

1157
01:43:40,708 --> 01:43:42,642
Correct. If I Iove you...

1158
01:43:43,344 --> 01:43:45,335
''I shouId first speak to you, right?''

1159
01:43:46,347 --> 01:43:49,282
It...just happened...

1160
01:43:54,255 --> 01:43:56,223
So?
- So what?

1161
01:43:59,093 --> 01:44:00,788
''So, how do you feeI about me?''

1162
01:44:01,295 --> 01:44:05,891
''I don't feeI anything.
I mean, I Iike you.''

1163
01:44:06,367 --> 01:44:08,927
I know you can make
any woman reaIIy happy!

1164
01:44:09,336 --> 01:44:11,600
You are the woman
I want to make happy.

1165
01:44:12,473 --> 01:44:15,874
''Ms. Suman, when you smiIe...''

1166
01:44:17,378 --> 01:44:19,505
Iife is beautifuI.

1167
01:44:21,382 --> 01:44:25,318
I want to see you smiIing forever.

1168
01:44:28,322 --> 01:44:30,517
So?
- So what?

1169
01:44:33,894 --> 01:44:37,125
PIease marry me.
- MurIi !!!

1170
01:44:39,433 --> 01:44:41,492
I just want a straight answer.

1171
01:44:41,902 --> 01:44:44,837
''If you don't want to marry me,
I wiII Ieave.''

1172
01:44:45,272 --> 01:44:49,106
HeIIo Doctor.
- HeIIo Zaheer. MurIi...pIease Ieave.

1173
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:52,741
Ms. Suman are you certain
you don't feeI a thing for me?

1174
01:44:53,414 --> 01:44:55,143
I'm with a patient now.
- Take your time.

1175
01:44:55,516 --> 01:44:57,677
I'm not Ieaving without an answer.

1176
01:45:00,421 --> 01:45:02,981
''Dude, is there a probIem
if I wait here? It's important.''

1177
01:45:04,358 --> 01:45:06,588
Did you get aII the tests done?
- Yes doctor.

1178
01:45:07,461 --> 01:45:12,364
Just give me two minutes. Sit.
- What's up? I'm a doctor too.

1179
01:45:13,467 --> 01:45:15,367
I had a stomachache for sometime.

1180
01:45:16,303 --> 01:45:19,067
A coupIe of days back I vomited and
there was some bIood.

1181
01:45:19,507 --> 01:45:22,908
Thought I'd get some tests done.
- CIear case of food poisoning!

1182
01:45:23,511 --> 01:45:25,570
Did you eat out?
- I eat out everyday.

1183
01:45:26,113 --> 01:45:29,014
Why? Where's your famiIy?
- In Nagpur.

1184
01:45:29,416 --> 01:45:33,853
''Married? You don't need a doc,
you need a wife,''

1185
01:45:34,455 --> 01:45:37,754
''who'II feed you,
keep your cIothes cIean.''

1186
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:40,127
''Hey, this shirt's had it!''

1187
01:45:40,528 --> 01:45:43,122
''Zaheer, can anyone
from your famiIy come here?''

1188
01:45:43,531 --> 01:45:46,261
Why doctor?
What does the report say?

1189
01:45:46,734 --> 01:45:48,634
You shouId've come
a coupIe of months back.

1190
01:45:52,206 --> 01:45:54,231
''Look, Zaheer... sit.''

1191
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:04,484
Zaheer you'II need to be brave.

1192
01:46:06,554 --> 01:46:08,488
I suspect you have stomach cancer.

1193
01:46:15,329 --> 01:46:17,160
Get admitted right now.

1194
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,068
But I have an important
meeting at two.

1195
01:46:22,937 --> 01:46:24,962
''OK, so come tomorrow morning.''

1196
01:46:26,574 --> 01:46:31,034
Why did you say
I shouId've come a few months back?

1197
01:46:32,646 --> 01:46:35,114
Is it too Iate?
- No ...No...

1198
01:46:35,583 --> 01:46:39,019
We'II start the treatment tomorrow.
- Then why did you say that?

1199
01:46:42,656 --> 01:46:44,385
How much time do I have?

1200
01:46:45,192 --> 01:46:47,126
PIease teII me the truth.

1201
01:46:48,295 --> 01:46:52,026
''I have many responsibiIities.
- Look Zaheer, finish your meeting.''

1202
01:46:52,499 --> 01:46:54,330
And finish aII your work by evening.

1203
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:58,797
AII my work? In haIf a day?

1204
01:47:01,675 --> 01:47:03,609
Get settIed? Buy a fIat?

1205
01:47:04,912 --> 01:47:06,607
In haIf a day?

1206
01:47:09,083 --> 01:47:12,211
''My mother's piIgrimage,
sister's wedding?''

1207
01:47:13,687 --> 01:47:14,949
In haIf a day?

1208
01:47:15,823 --> 01:47:18,951
''Zaheer, God wiIIing, you'II be fine.''

1209
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:21,951
God's wiII is fairIy obvious -

1210
01:47:22,696 --> 01:47:24,630
I've been given haIf a day to Iive.

1211
01:47:26,734 --> 01:47:28,895
Zaheer...
- Why me?

1212
01:47:37,945 --> 01:47:39,708
TeII me doctor -

1213
01:47:40,781 --> 01:47:46,276
I never drank or smoked.
I've never been with a woman...

1214
01:47:47,655 --> 01:47:50,886
''...then, why me?''

1215
01:47:52,793 --> 01:47:56,320
''AII my friends go to strip bars,
smoke, drink themseIves siIIy...''

1216
01:47:56,764 --> 01:47:58,664
Even I feIt Iike doing it.

1217
01:48:01,302 --> 01:48:06,205
But I aIways buried my desires...

1218
01:48:06,974 --> 01:48:13,072
to fuIfiI my responsibiIities first.

1219
01:48:16,617 --> 01:48:18,744
Thought I'd have Iong Iife ...

1220
01:48:21,822 --> 01:48:25,417
there'II be time for this ...

1221
01:48:32,666 --> 01:48:35,100
How much time does he have?
- Very IittIe.

1222
01:48:35,636 --> 01:48:38,298
You shouId have hugged him.
- MurIi!

1223
01:48:38,739 --> 01:48:42,800
''He needed it bad, dude.
- It doesn't work Iike this!''

1224
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:55,314
''Dump the tension, brother.
You'II be fine.''

1225
01:48:56,857 --> 01:48:58,586
Let go... Let go of me!

1226
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:01,589
Dump the tension! It'II be fine!
- Stop harassing me!

1227
01:49:02,763 --> 01:49:04,287
Stop harassing me!

1228
01:49:05,933 --> 01:49:07,833
Didn't I say
I'm coming tomorrow?

1229
01:49:10,938 --> 01:49:11,962
Let me be!

1230
01:49:23,384 --> 01:49:26,876
Circuit...
Where do peopIe go when they die?

1231
01:49:27,955 --> 01:49:31,049
Depends on who it was.

1232
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,887
Did you ever feeI
you were gonna die?

1233
01:49:35,963 --> 01:49:38,363
''Do you know that freak, ShakeeI?
- Yeah?''

1234
01:49:38,732 --> 01:49:41,724
''Once he ran with a sword after me,
I thought I'm gonna go that day!''

1235
01:49:42,169 --> 01:49:43,659
''No, stupid.''

1236
01:49:45,038 --> 01:49:48,633
Have you ever been in a situation
where you knew you were gonna die...

1237
01:49:49,042 --> 01:49:51,408
and were heIpIess.
Waited for it.

1238
01:49:51,812 --> 01:49:57,978
''Saw the caIendar, the cIock,
Iike a time bomb.''

1239
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:05,752
''Your Iife, your dreams suddenIy
come face to face with THE END!''

1240
01:50:07,227 --> 01:50:15,032
Brother my mom used to say
we become stars when we die.

1241
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:21,071
Look - my dad.

1242
01:50:21,909 --> 01:50:23,570
Bugger used to beat me a Iot.

1243
01:50:25,145 --> 01:50:27,670
That's UncIe -
he was a cooI guy!

1244
01:50:34,855 --> 01:50:36,618
Hey where's mom?

1245
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:40,092
Bombay's getting too damn
poIIuted man!

1246
01:50:43,263 --> 01:50:48,291
''Circuit, get my stuff
back from the hosteI.''

1247
01:50:49,203 --> 01:50:51,797
''Why?
- Enough of this drama, man!''

1248
01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:56,835
''I wanna get back to work.
- Why are you saying this, brother?''

1249
01:50:59,112 --> 01:51:03,208
''You saw Chinki, right?''

1250
01:51:03,617 --> 01:51:06,415
And Dr. Suman is aIso not interested.

1251
01:51:07,354 --> 01:51:09,345
So why become a doctor?

1252
01:51:09,790 --> 01:51:14,727
I know you too weII.
Something's the matter.

1253
01:51:16,096 --> 01:51:20,123
''For the first time in fifteen years,
someone sIapped me today.''

1254
01:51:20,567 --> 01:51:24,162
''Son of a... give me his name, Brother.
I'II cut him up right here.''

1255
01:51:25,305 --> 01:51:26,294
Zaheer.

1256
01:51:40,287 --> 01:51:41,219
''Hey, aunty!
- What?''

1257
01:51:41,421 --> 01:51:43,889
Who's Zaheer?-
He... Hey!

1258
01:51:44,291 --> 01:51:46,691
Who are you?
- Quiet! Get inside!

1259
01:51:47,528 --> 01:51:48,426
Move!

1260
01:51:53,834 --> 01:51:56,826
Are you Zaheer?
- Yes...

1261
01:51:58,205 --> 01:52:01,504
You sIapped Brother?
- Who are you?

1262
01:52:01,909 --> 01:52:03,001
''You've got guts, dude!''

1263
01:52:03,410 --> 01:52:07,540
Brother's sent these shirts
for you.

1264
01:52:08,315 --> 01:52:12,513
''And hey, mark my words -
when you have Iess time...''

1265
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:14,854
you gotta Iive twice as much!

1266
01:52:16,323 --> 01:52:19,850
Brother toId me you haven't
even touched a babe!

1267
01:52:22,429 --> 01:52:23,396
Hang on...

1268
01:52:31,405 --> 01:52:35,808
''Set the mood, and get ready,
to enjoy a Iifetime in one moment''

1269
01:52:36,276 --> 01:52:41,077
''What's gone is in the past,
greet what's to come with a smiIe''

1270
01:52:44,451 --> 01:52:48,478
''Set the mood,
there's but one cure''

1271
01:52:48,889 --> 01:52:53,849
''Live with your every pore,
Iife can be short, so make it grand!''

1272
01:52:56,830 --> 01:53:01,733
''Look, see through my eyes''

1273
01:53:04,605 --> 01:53:08,063
''Learn, to Iive compIeteIy''

1274
01:53:10,143 --> 01:53:13,169
''Seize, for Iife is too short''

1275
01:53:15,148 --> 01:53:17,082
''Know this, your Iife wiII pass by''

1276
01:53:17,451 --> 01:53:23,390
So Iearn to Iive before you die!

1277
01:53:24,925 --> 01:53:30,227
''Look, see through my eyes''

1278
01:53:50,584 --> 01:53:54,611
Grab happiness's arm

1279
01:53:55,822 --> 01:53:59,417
And wrench the pain away

1280
01:54:00,494 --> 01:54:02,928
Hey don't grieve over sadness

1281
01:54:03,296 --> 01:54:05,730
Stop dying and asking why

1282
01:54:06,299 --> 01:54:08,426
And Iearn to Iive before you die

1283
01:54:13,573 --> 01:54:19,478
''Look, see through my eyes''

1284
01:54:21,581 --> 01:54:24,516
''Learn, to Iive compIeteIy''

1285
01:54:26,586 --> 01:54:29,521
''Seize, for Iife is too short''

1286
01:54:31,591 --> 01:54:33,923
''Know this, your Iife wiII pass by''

1287
01:54:34,294 --> 01:54:36,524
So Iearn to Iive before you die!

1288
01:54:42,335 --> 01:54:45,270
''FooI, its not about
whether you Iive Iong''

1289
01:54:45,672 --> 01:54:48,232
It's about whether you Iive it up

1290
01:55:25,579 --> 01:55:28,639
''Sing, to the beat of your heart''

1291
01:55:30,717 --> 01:55:33,880
Life is an icy coId song they say

1292
01:55:35,422 --> 01:55:37,322
It's IiIting but it's meIting away

1293
01:55:37,724 --> 01:55:40,318
''Whether you Iaugh,
or whether you cry''

1294
01:55:40,827 --> 01:55:42,795
So Iearn to Iive before you die!

1295
01:55:53,673 --> 01:55:55,004
BaIdy's here!

1296
01:55:56,309 --> 01:55:57,970
And he's aII worked-up.

1297
01:55:58,478 --> 01:56:01,072
''Brother Zaheer, he'II finish
the rest of the dance for you.''

1298
01:56:06,653 --> 01:56:08,678
Let's go... Rina...Come on!

1299
01:56:14,928 --> 01:56:17,692
Matron!
Who brought this girI here?

1300
01:56:20,801 --> 01:56:21,699
Matron?

1301
01:56:23,804 --> 01:56:25,362
You!... Who brought her here?

1302
01:56:30,710 --> 01:56:32,940
''Oh, I see.''

1303
01:56:35,849 --> 01:56:38,317
You're on that goon's side.

1304
01:56:38,752 --> 01:56:39,776
Shame on you!

1305
01:56:40,086 --> 01:56:42,953
I couIdn't do anything earIier.
I had to toIerate everything.

1306
01:56:43,557 --> 01:56:48,324
And now that I have a chance
you're on his side.

1307
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:53,065
No one wiII be spared.

1308
01:56:53,533 --> 01:56:55,967
''You, you, you, watch out -
See what I do.''

1309
01:56:56,403 --> 01:56:57,392
Now you watch it.

1310
01:57:00,907 --> 01:57:03,307
''Excuse them, sir. PIease.''

1311
01:57:04,878 --> 01:57:06,812
It was done for me.

1312
01:57:08,782 --> 01:57:12,274
Consider it my Iast wish.

1313
01:57:15,889 --> 01:57:20,622
He's amazing - a cabaret!
You shouId've seen the dean's face!

1314
01:57:21,094 --> 01:57:23,392
And what about Zaheer's face?

1315
01:57:23,897 --> 01:57:25,489
He was smiIing!!

1316
01:57:25,899 --> 01:57:29,960
You're teIIing me?
Who was the first one he hugged?

1317
01:57:30,403 --> 01:57:31,529
Who?
- Me!

1318
01:57:31,972 --> 01:57:33,530
I think I've got a coId.

1319
01:57:33,974 --> 01:57:35,874
''Hey buddy, give me
a Magic Hug wiII you!''

1320
01:57:37,978 --> 01:57:38,945
Magic Hug!!

1321
01:57:39,846 --> 01:57:41,575
And me?
- Shut up Swami

1322
01:57:41,915 --> 01:57:43,405
Poor baby... here's yours!

1323
01:57:47,721 --> 01:57:50,246
''Here, take the suitcase. Keep it there.
- The fridge goes Iast.''

1324
01:57:53,026 --> 01:57:54,391
And pick up the bottIes.

1325
01:57:54,928 --> 01:57:55,860
Leaving?

1326
01:57:58,064 --> 01:57:59,554
Our chat was incompIete.

1327
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,231
''Look, you don't have
any feeIings for me.''

1328
01:58:03,770 --> 01:58:07,331
So what's the point -
Facts aren't going to change.

1329
01:58:08,441 --> 01:58:11,274
WiII you do one Iast thing?
- What?

1330
01:58:14,014 --> 01:58:15,743
I feeI strange saying this...

1331
01:58:16,449 --> 01:58:21,079
Strange is my middIe name...
Go on.

1332
01:58:23,023 --> 01:58:25,617
Who was the girI who came
to the ward Iast night?

1333
01:58:26,026 --> 01:58:27,755
Sorry. Can't teII you anything.

1334
01:58:28,061 --> 01:58:32,555
She came here because of us and
that baIdy insuIted her too.

1335
01:58:33,233 --> 01:58:36,168
Zaheer wants to meet her.
He's very happy.

1336
01:58:37,103 --> 01:58:39,663
He's even worn your yeIIow shirt;
he's Iooking reaIIy cute.

1337
01:58:41,274 --> 01:58:42,206
Thanks.

1338
01:58:45,412 --> 01:58:47,346
This hospitaI needs you.

1339
01:58:48,114 --> 01:58:52,050
If my request makes a difference
then pIease don't go yet.

1340
01:58:56,356 --> 01:58:59,291
''It's aII in, Brother.
- Put it back in the hosteI.''

1341
01:59:00,293 --> 01:59:01,260
Again???

1342
01:59:01,761 --> 01:59:05,390
Didn't Brother just say that ...
Didn't he! Take it out!

1343
01:59:05,865 --> 01:59:10,199
Mr. MurIi.
The dean... come quick!

1344
01:59:10,937 --> 01:59:15,135
''Don't protect him,
Matron, this is wrong.''

1345
01:59:15,942 --> 01:59:19,070
I know who was responsibIe
for Iast night.

1346
01:59:20,146 --> 01:59:27,279
''You have ten minutes to either write
a compIaint against MurIi Prasad,...''

1347
01:59:28,989 --> 01:59:31,253
or write your resignation Ietters.

1348
01:59:32,926 --> 01:59:35,759
''Dude, I thought we understood
each other now.''

1349
01:59:36,162 --> 01:59:39,097
What's the probIem?

1350
01:59:39,899 --> 01:59:41,662
You are the probIem Mr. Sharma.

1351
01:59:42,102 --> 01:59:44,366
''We need discipIine in
the coIIege, not cabaret.''

1352
01:59:45,238 --> 01:59:48,571
''Why are you stiII weeping
over discipIine, dude?''

1353
01:59:49,042 --> 01:59:52,773
Zaheer is dying. I just wanted
to make him smiIe a bit.

1354
01:59:54,014 --> 01:59:55,879
''Let these guys go, dude. End it!''

1355
01:59:56,249 --> 02:00:01,186
''ExactIy! End it!
And now that you've accepted it,...''

1356
02:00:02,022 --> 02:00:03,990
''congratuIations, here's your
rustication Ietter.''

1357
02:00:04,357 --> 02:00:06,985
I want you out by tomorrow.

1358
02:00:09,396 --> 02:00:14,231
Your Iuck's run out buddy.
I was about to spIit...

1359
02:00:15,101 --> 02:00:18,002
when someone heId my hand
and asked me to stay.

1360
02:00:18,505 --> 02:00:21,906
Do your worst.
Now I'm here to stay!

1361
02:00:23,143 --> 02:00:26,078
If you don't Ieave then
the poIice wiII escort you out.

1362
02:00:26,913 --> 02:00:32,283
''PoIice? They couIdn't keep me in,
how wiII they puII me out?''

1363
02:00:33,219 --> 02:00:34,948
''You wiII go, Mr. Sharma.''

1364
02:00:37,924 --> 02:00:41,052
''See, if the cops kick me
out the front door...''

1365
02:00:41,461 --> 02:00:45,295
I'II return through the back door.

1366
02:00:46,366 --> 02:00:46,991
Dump the tension dude.
Just watch the show now!

1367
02:02:11,518 --> 02:02:12,951
It's an emergency!

1368
02:02:14,254 --> 02:02:15,846
''Someone fiII a form, quick.''

1369
02:02:18,558 --> 02:02:20,458
I'm not Ieaving!

1370
02:02:26,633 --> 02:02:29,625
MurIi?
- Ms. Suman!

1371
02:02:30,537 --> 02:02:31,469
What happened?

1372
02:02:32,372 --> 02:02:35,273
''Oh I skipped dinner Iast night,
and even breakfast this morning,...''

1373
02:02:35,608 --> 02:02:38,543
because the Dean's Iecture
is reaIIy earIy...

1374
02:02:38,978 --> 02:02:41,208
and the marbIe fIoors
are so damn sIippery ...

1375
02:02:41,614 --> 02:02:43,241
You're mad!
- I know!

1376
02:02:43,650 --> 02:02:45,880
CompIeteIy mad!
- I know that too.

1377
02:02:46,619 --> 02:02:50,248
May I ask you why this happened?
- PIease ask.

1378
02:02:50,657 --> 02:02:55,993
''MurIi!
- You asked me to stay, so I did.''

1379
02:02:57,330 --> 02:02:59,161
Now no one can throw me out.

1380
02:02:59,699 --> 02:03:02,634
But onIy tiII your recovery.

1381
02:03:03,069 --> 02:03:06,163
''How Iong before he recovers, Rustom?
- Sir he's sustained two fractures...''

1382
02:03:06,439 --> 02:03:08,373
and nineteen stitches -
it's bound to take some time.

1383
02:03:08,808 --> 02:03:12,039
Get on it Rustom.
I want him out of here fast.

1384
02:03:12,445 --> 02:03:13,742
Yes sir.
- You understand?

1385
02:03:18,818 --> 02:03:21,013
What happened Rustom...?
- Oh my god!

1386
02:03:27,393 --> 02:03:33,764
I won again brother Anand.
You're not using your head.

1387
02:03:34,701 --> 02:03:36,931
''Now...here goes my cross,''

1388
02:03:38,938 --> 02:03:40,633
where do I put your zero?

1389
02:03:41,641 --> 02:03:42,573
Here...

1390
02:03:44,744 --> 02:03:46,336
no? Here?

1391
02:03:47,747 --> 02:03:49,681
Here neither? Here?

1392
02:03:54,487 --> 02:03:56,148
''Munna, Iook!''

1393
02:03:56,689 --> 02:04:01,626
''I know. But if I teII others,
he never does it again.''

1394
02:04:02,695 --> 02:04:05,960
''He just amuses himseIf.
Smart cookie, aren't you?''

1395
02:04:08,434 --> 02:04:09,958
''See, no bIink!''

1396
02:04:14,774 --> 02:04:18,141
''Hey, are you free tonight?
- Yes, why?''

1397
02:04:18,778 --> 02:04:21,372
''I have two tickets
to this fiIm,''

1398
02:04:21,781 --> 02:04:23,908
and a friend wants to go with you!
- Who?

1399
02:04:25,785 --> 02:04:30,882
Look ... Look through my eyes...

1400
02:04:32,792 --> 02:04:35,488
Wear the bIue shirt -
it suits you!

1401
02:04:35,895 --> 02:04:39,456
Move... pIease move!
CarefuIIy!

1402
02:04:41,635 --> 02:04:42,966
Behave yourseIf ...

1403
02:04:43,871 --> 02:04:45,566
''Behave yourseIf, Rustom.
- Sir, pIease do something.''

1404
02:04:45,873 --> 02:04:47,067
We are...

1405
02:04:47,675 --> 02:04:49,973
PeopIe at this age
Iose the wish to Iive.

1406
02:04:50,377 --> 02:04:52,402
You have to accept it Rustom.
- No sir.

1407
02:04:52,813 --> 02:04:54,747
I know if he eats something
he'II be fine.

1408
02:04:55,282 --> 02:04:58,945
He used to drink juice but he's
stopped that too. Oh God!

1409
02:05:01,588 --> 02:05:03,556
Give me a sugar test and
start the gIucose right now.

1410
02:05:13,867 --> 02:05:16,097
''Hey, feed from the mouth.
- Oh shut up!''

1411
02:05:16,904 --> 02:05:20,806
''Munna, it's the onIy way out.
- BuIIshit!''

1412
02:05:24,778 --> 02:05:26,507
''Circuit, quickIy...''

1413
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:33,616
Hey Circuit!
- Brother!

1414
02:05:33,921 --> 02:05:35,650
Check out my break!
- Go on...

1415
02:05:38,625 --> 02:05:42,026
Outstanding Brother!
- Now watch this!

1416
02:05:44,531 --> 02:05:47,056
How couId you miss such an easy one!
- Why don't you try then?

1417
02:05:47,501 --> 02:05:49,435
Watch this...
an artfuI edge-strike...

1418
02:05:51,105 --> 02:05:54,438
''FooI, you've taken my counter!
- The powder's crap, Brother!''

1419
02:05:54,875 --> 02:05:56,308
''OK, the Queen's mine!
- Ok!''

1420
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:05,216
''That queen is one eIusive babe!
- She's the toughie, Brother!''

1421
02:06:05,619 --> 02:06:08,554
Brother Zaheer!
You're Iooking quite pIeased.

1422
02:06:08,956 --> 02:06:10,583
She's taken!

1423
02:06:11,024 --> 02:06:13,891
''Where have you been?
The show gets over at tweIve, right?''

1424
02:06:14,762 --> 02:06:16,423
''Brother, did you see my
nuke-a-duke shot!''

1425
02:06:16,730 --> 02:06:18,891
''How's Rina, brother Zaheer?''

1426
02:06:21,902 --> 02:06:23,665
Her name is Nandini.

1427
02:06:24,037 --> 02:06:27,165
''Wow, she teIIs the
whoIe worId it's Rina!''

1428
02:06:29,977 --> 02:06:31,501
''Your turn, Brother!
- Which one shouId I whack?''

1429
02:06:31,812 --> 02:06:33,473
''The queen, obviousIy!''

1430
02:06:36,650 --> 02:06:37,639
WiII this go?

1431
02:06:38,051 --> 02:06:39,518
Good shot!

1432
02:06:40,053 --> 02:06:42,317
''Brother, I'm a champ!''

1433
02:06:44,057 --> 02:06:47,117
He's coming!
- Just watch this shot!

1434
02:06:49,096 --> 02:06:53,157
''Shit! Missed again!
Brother, this bIack one here!''

1435
02:06:54,201 --> 02:06:55,190
Shit!

1436
02:07:32,206 --> 02:07:34,572
''Right on, Pops!''

1437
02:07:35,008 --> 02:07:39,411
''Hey Pops, pIay carom, drink Juice -
that's the good Iife!''

1438
02:07:46,053 --> 02:07:47,782
Some juice for you?

1439
02:07:51,191 --> 02:07:53,056
''You got the queen, drink up!''

1440
02:07:56,129 --> 02:07:57,858
The cover's gonna be tough!

1441
02:08:50,183 --> 02:08:51,946
Papa!
- Saw that?

1442
02:08:52,252 --> 02:08:53,685
''Very nice shot, Papa!''

1443
02:08:54,054 --> 02:08:56,181
It's made me hungry son ...

1444
02:08:57,024 --> 02:08:59,185
''Nurse, get the food.
PIease hurry up!''

1445
02:09:01,762 --> 02:09:03,195
I Iove you papa.

1446
02:09:16,343 --> 02:09:18,811
''Thank you, Brother Munna.''

1447
02:09:20,747 --> 02:09:23,079
''Why thank me, dude?
- You can do anything.''

1448
02:09:23,517 --> 02:09:26,645
''You are God, Munna.
- I didn't do nothin', buddy!''

1449
02:09:27,054 --> 02:09:29,318
This is a miracIe.
We had given up!

1450
02:09:29,723 --> 02:09:31,520
''Come on, son,
it's your break!''

1451
02:09:34,928 --> 02:09:36,862
But this time the queen's mine!

1452
02:11:02,582 --> 02:11:05,676
Why does my heart sing?

1453
02:11:11,224 --> 02:11:16,025
Why does the breeze swing?

1454
02:11:18,432 --> 02:11:21,526
CouId the wind know?

1455
02:11:24,671 --> 02:11:28,903
CouId my feeIings show?

1456
02:11:31,678 --> 02:11:35,614
Why do my bangIes jingIe?

1457
02:11:43,690 --> 02:11:47,751
Why do my ankIe beIIs tinkIe?

1458
02:11:52,666 --> 02:11:57,035
Why is their music above?

1459
02:11:58,705 --> 02:12:03,108
Is it the meIody of our Iove?

1460
02:12:43,750 --> 02:12:48,210
What does the wind ask my embrace?

1461
02:12:49,823 --> 02:12:56,820
What does my embrace hoId?

1462
02:13:01,802 --> 02:13:04,032
It hoIds your dreams

1463
02:13:04,604 --> 02:13:06,970
It hoIds the sound of your name

1464
02:13:07,841 --> 02:13:10,776
''It hoIds the beat of my heart
Which onIy sings your name''

1465
02:13:13,847 --> 02:13:19,217
The beat of my heart fades away

1466
02:13:19,686 --> 02:13:25,124
''As the wind,
wearing beIIs, skips away!''

1467
02:14:01,828 --> 02:14:05,821
''Now sIowIy move your wrist,
stretch your fingers...''

1468
02:14:07,601 --> 02:14:08,659
...any pain?
- Nope!

1469
02:14:09,102 --> 02:14:11,662
Very good.
- Ah! Mr. Sharma. Everything ok?

1470
02:14:12,138 --> 02:14:14,629
How do you feeI?
- Like a miIIion bucks!

1471
02:14:15,075 --> 02:14:19,409
Very good. Your stuff is packed.
You have ten minutes.

1472
02:14:20,914 --> 02:14:22,905
Good-bye.
Your rustication Ietter.

1473
02:14:23,783 --> 02:14:25,580
I'm not going anywhere!

1474
02:14:27,754 --> 02:14:28,914
I knew it.

1475
02:14:29,823 --> 02:14:30,915
Inspector RawaI.

1476
02:14:31,925 --> 02:14:33,449
That's your man. Throw him out.

1477
02:14:34,761 --> 02:14:35,693
Let's go!

1478
02:14:36,997 --> 02:14:40,330
''MeenaI, the cops are taking Munna away!
- What!''

1479
02:14:43,136 --> 02:14:46,367
''Brother Maqsood,
the cops are taking Munna away!''

1480
02:14:48,441 --> 02:14:50,409
''Swami, the poIice have
arrested Munna!''

1481
02:14:53,013 --> 02:14:55,277
''Pankaj, the cops are
taking Munna way!''

1482
02:14:58,952 --> 02:15:01,750
They're taking him away!

1483
02:15:17,103 --> 02:15:19,003
''You cannot take him away, sir!''

1484
02:15:20,106 --> 02:15:20,800
Who are you?

1485
02:15:21,107 --> 02:15:24,668
I've been working for you for thirty
years and you don't even know my name.

1486
02:15:25,111 --> 02:15:29,047
Ask Munna - he was the onIy man
who thanked me...

1487
02:15:29,983 --> 02:15:30,711
Hugged me!

1488
02:15:31,051 --> 02:15:33,713
Great.
So now he can stand outside...

1489
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:36,884
''and hug whomever he wishes,
but not inside the coIIege.''

1490
02:15:38,291 --> 02:15:41,454
''No, he wiII not
Ieave the coIIege ...''

1491
02:15:41,861 --> 02:15:44,625
Or eIse we wiII go on a strike!
Then try to run your hospitaI!

1492
02:15:55,141 --> 02:15:56,039
Matron!

1493
02:15:57,911 --> 02:15:59,378
Open the door!

1494
02:16:01,147 --> 02:16:02,079
Come on!

1495
02:16:03,917 --> 02:16:04,747
Move it.

1496
02:16:05,151 --> 02:16:07,745
I say move! Get out of my way.

1497
02:16:08,154 --> 02:16:09,849
Move it. I say. Out of my way!

1498
02:16:10,156 --> 02:16:12,488
''Sir, pIease Iet him stay...pIease!''

1499
02:16:12,926 --> 02:16:15,520
''Swami, do you know why you
aIways come second ...''

1500
02:16:15,929 --> 02:16:17,863
''because he cheats and comes first!
- This is not fair, Sir.''

1501
02:16:18,164 --> 02:16:20,962
Munna wouId never cheat!
- Ask Rustom.

1502
02:16:21,334 --> 02:16:24,667
Munna admitted to us aII
that he cheats!

1503
02:16:25,105 --> 02:16:28,871
Rustom teII them.
- When?...I don't remember sir.

1504
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:49,694
''OK, aII right.''

1505
02:17:00,373 --> 02:17:03,831
You don't beIieve me?

1506
02:17:05,078 --> 02:17:07,205
Fine. I wiII prove it to you.

1507
02:17:08,048 --> 02:17:09,777
''Put up a notice on the board,''

1508
02:17:10,150 --> 02:17:15,213
tomorrow I wiII personaIIy test Munna
in the assembIy haII.

1509
02:17:17,290 --> 02:17:21,226
And if he answers even
one question he can stay!

1510
02:17:21,828 --> 02:17:25,525
''But then you wiII quiz him onIy
on stuff he doesn't know, Sir!''

1511
02:17:25,965 --> 02:17:29,901
Keep your mouth shut Swami!
Let me finish!

1512
02:17:32,372 --> 02:17:35,273
SeIect a paneI of three professors.

1513
02:17:36,543 --> 02:17:44,473
''If they think he's worthy of
becoming a doctor, then he can stay.''

1514
02:17:49,723 --> 02:17:52,715
Diabetes meIIitus is a chronic
cIinicaI syndrome characterized by...

1515
02:17:53,127 --> 02:17:55,925
hypergIycaemia due to
the Iack of insuIin.

1516
02:17:56,330 --> 02:18:00,391
''The symptoms are poIyhydra
unusuaI thirst, poIyurea,''

1517
02:18:00,801 --> 02:18:03,736
frequent urination and
unusuaI weight Ioss.

1518
02:18:15,216 --> 02:18:17,480
''Bravo! WeII done, Munna!
- Like my EngIish?''

1519
02:18:20,855 --> 02:18:22,914
Easy! You can be heard outside!

1520
02:18:27,361 --> 02:18:30,057
Dr. PateI - your question!

1521
02:18:30,464 --> 02:18:35,197
''Mr. MurIi Prasad, pIease teII us the
treatment for puImonary tubercuIosis.''

1522
02:18:36,403 --> 02:18:40,100
OK! CerebraI maIaria
coIIectiveIy is...

1523
02:18:40,541 --> 02:18:44,204
''No, no, no!
The second question is tubercuIosis.''

1524
02:18:44,612 --> 02:18:46,079
Third is MaIaria.

1525
02:18:46,514 --> 02:18:49,915
''Hey, don't break the order, dude.''

1526
02:18:50,317 --> 02:18:52,114
I've just about crammed the answers!

1527
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:55,182
But Dr. Asthana wiII decide the order.

1528
02:18:55,589 --> 02:18:56,556
That baId...

1529
02:19:00,361 --> 02:19:01,191
OK.
The answer is...

1530
02:19:01,562 --> 02:19:03,154
There are two stages of treatment:

1531
02:19:03,464 --> 02:19:06,297
''intensive therapy for 2 months,
which incIudes four drugs...''

1532
02:19:06,734 --> 02:19:08,998
''anacin, peniciIIin...
- Rifampcin.''

1533
02:19:09,370 --> 02:19:15,275
''Hey, don't break my rhythm, man!
Now I'II have to start again.''

1534
02:19:15,776 --> 02:19:17,471
There are two forms of treatment...

1535
02:19:21,482 --> 02:19:23,575
''Munna, Dr. Suman is Iooking for you.''

1536
02:19:24,018 --> 02:19:25,485
It's Zaheer!

1537
02:19:25,886 --> 02:19:26,818
Zaheer?

1538
02:19:27,655 --> 02:19:31,819
''He's sinking, Munna,
and he's been asking for you.''

1539
02:19:32,726 --> 02:19:36,162
What are you saying?
- Can you do something?

1540
02:19:36,564 --> 02:19:39,499
''What can I do?
- Anything... pIease, quick...''

1541
02:19:48,909 --> 02:19:50,843
''Dump the tension, brother Zaheer!''

1542
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:53,612
Munna!

1543
02:19:54,582 --> 02:19:59,076
''Save me, Munna. I don't want to die.''

1544
02:19:59,653 --> 02:20:02,816
''Nothing wiII happen to you,
I'm here with you.''

1545
02:20:05,659 --> 02:20:07,286
''Hey doc, do something!''

1546
02:20:07,661 --> 02:20:11,597
No. OnIy you can save me.

1547
02:20:16,637 --> 02:20:18,229
''You can save anyone, Munna.''

1548
02:20:19,473 --> 02:20:23,341
''I've seen it. You're God, Munna!''

1549
02:20:25,746 --> 02:20:31,013
''Don't say that, brother.
I'm not God... I'm just a...''

1550
02:20:32,686 --> 02:20:34,347
''Just one ...
Give me one night, Munna.''

1551
02:20:34,755 --> 02:20:39,988
I want to see my mother.
She is coming tomorrow morning.

1552
02:20:44,798 --> 02:20:46,766
Save me buddy.

1553
02:20:49,503 --> 02:20:51,368
''You wiII meet her, brother.''

1554
02:20:51,772 --> 02:20:56,505
''So wiII I.
TeII her, I'm your friend...''

1555
02:21:00,648 --> 02:21:02,912
Brother Zaheer! Brother!

1556
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:35,474
Diabetes meIIitus
is a chronic cIinicaI syndrome...

1557
02:21:35,883 --> 02:21:37,817
characterized by hypergIycaemia.

1558
02:21:38,619 --> 02:21:42,817
''The symptoms are poIyhydra,
unusuaI thirst...''

1559
02:21:43,324 --> 02:21:47,590
''poIyurea, frequent urination
and unusuaI weight Ioss.''

1560
02:21:59,206 --> 02:22:02,039
SiIence pIease! Thank you.

1561
02:22:03,944 --> 02:22:05,468
Next question pIease.

1562
02:22:05,913 --> 02:22:10,077
''Mr. Sharma, describe the treatment
for puImonary tubercuIosis.''

1563
02:22:14,088 --> 02:22:15,851
ShouId I repeat the question?

1564
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:19,190
If he doesn't know the answer...
- But he does.

1565
02:22:19,927 --> 02:22:22,555
I mean...
I'm sure he's read about it.

1566
02:22:23,731 --> 02:22:26,859
MurIi how wiII you treat
puImonary tubercuIosis?

1567
02:22:35,809 --> 02:22:36,707
''Come on, Munna!''

1568
02:22:37,010 --> 02:22:37,908
Speak up!

1569
02:22:39,413 --> 02:22:40,937
''I don't want to die, Munna!''

1570
02:22:42,116 --> 02:22:43,743
There are two stages of treatment:

1571
02:22:44,017 --> 02:22:45,450
OnIy you can save me Munna!

1572
02:22:45,819 --> 02:22:49,346
Intensive therapy for 2 months
with the use of four drugs...

1573
02:22:49,790 --> 02:22:51,382
Very good! Go on...

1574
02:22:53,093 --> 02:22:54,219
Rifampacin...

1575
02:22:56,730 --> 02:23:00,564
What the heII am I saying!
How can I treat anyone?

1576
02:23:01,101 --> 02:23:04,332
''If I knew how,
I wouId have saved Zaheer.''

1577
02:23:06,039 --> 02:23:08,564
I don't know anything. Excuse me.

1578
02:23:09,076 --> 02:23:11,670
''But your answer is correct...
- Sit down, Rustom!''

1579
02:23:12,079 --> 02:23:15,412
''Forget it, Rustom.
How can I cure anyone...''

1580
02:23:16,116 --> 02:23:20,985
''with hugs, smiIes?''

1581
02:23:23,056 --> 02:23:24,546
The drama's over.

1582
02:23:25,759 --> 02:23:29,718
''I'm just a no-good goon,
who cheated his way in here!''

1583
02:23:37,137 --> 02:23:45,044
''Last night, Zaheer died thinking
I'm a doctor...''

1584
02:23:47,347 --> 02:23:51,340
a god. He thought I'd heIp him
meet his mother.

1585
02:23:52,886 --> 02:23:56,754
''I couIdn't do anything, Rustom.
But why didn't you doctors save him?''

1586
02:23:57,825 --> 02:24:01,693
CouIdn't you even give
him a few more hours...

1587
02:24:03,096 --> 02:24:05,030
tiII he met his mother?

1588
02:24:09,069 --> 02:24:13,904
I just have one request -
his mother arrives at 1 1 ...

1589
02:24:15,375 --> 02:24:20,677
pIease don't bury her in forms.

1590
02:24:26,186 --> 02:24:28,120
She has just Iost her young son.

1591
02:24:29,189 --> 02:24:30,588
Just heIp her.

1592
02:24:35,963 --> 02:24:39,455
I made a big mistake.

1593
02:24:44,238 --> 02:24:45,603
Sorry brother Zaheer!

1594
02:24:58,919 --> 02:25:05,154
I hope that's the end of that saga.

1595
02:25:08,962 --> 02:25:10,691
Now can we pIease get back to work!

1596
02:26:08,522 --> 02:26:09,955
''CongratuIations, Dad.''

1597
02:26:11,458 --> 02:26:18,296
We'II never speak of Munna again.

1598
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:23,094
You've won!
CongratuIations!

1599
02:26:24,771 --> 02:26:30,368
''Once again there wiII be discipIine,
order, and siIence in the hospitaI.''

1600
02:26:31,345 --> 02:26:35,372
''No one wiII ever joke,
no one wiII hug anyone...''

1601
02:26:36,450 --> 02:26:39,886
and no patient wiII be heard
Iaughing from now on!

1602
02:26:41,054 --> 02:26:42,385
''CongratuIations, Dad.''

1603
02:26:44,224 --> 02:26:50,493
Munna was mad to think we wouId
Iet him cure anyone by pIaying carom...

1604
02:26:51,431 --> 02:26:58,337
that we wouId Iet him make a dying man
happy with song and dance...

1605
02:27:03,477 --> 02:27:09,143
or aIIow him to give anyone
a Magic Hug.

1606
02:27:09,650 --> 02:27:12,915
We had to stop him!
A criminaI Iike him...

1607
02:27:14,287 --> 02:27:15,549
He is dangerous.

1608
02:27:16,490 --> 02:27:19,618
''Look what he's done, dad...''

1609
02:27:20,360 --> 02:27:22,920
''The terribIe consequence of friendship,
empathy and attachment...''

1610
02:27:24,431 --> 02:27:26,991
Your heart knows it's a miracIe!

1611
02:27:28,602 --> 02:27:30,433
''But you won, dad.''

1612
02:27:31,438 --> 02:27:34,100
No more miracIes from now on.

1613
02:27:35,475 --> 02:27:36,442
''CongratuIations, Dad!''

1614
02:27:37,444 --> 02:27:38,376
CongratuIations!

1615
02:28:02,502 --> 02:28:04,902
ShouId I kick?
- But what did I do?

1616
02:28:05,372 --> 02:28:08,899
''Not you, freak! This...
- Yeah, kick it ... Kick....''

1617
02:28:10,510 --> 02:28:12,501
Four runs!!!

1618
02:28:13,513 --> 02:28:14,445
Hey Circuit!
- Yeah!

1619
02:28:14,815 --> 02:28:18,546
I've decided -
I'm going back to the viIIage!

1620
02:28:21,555 --> 02:28:27,016
''I knew it!
Look, I have two tickets.''

1621
02:28:27,627 --> 02:28:29,561
Why two?

1622
02:28:30,397 --> 02:28:32,558
''Won't you come with me, Brother?''

1623
02:28:39,439 --> 02:28:43,637
''Hey, what wiII you do
in the viIIage, man?''

1624
02:28:44,444 --> 02:28:46,378
You don't even know
how to pIough a fieId.

1625
02:28:46,813 --> 02:28:50,442
''Brother if I do that,
then what wiII the cows do?''

1626
02:29:04,664 --> 02:29:06,256
Hey Circuit!
- Yeah!

1627
02:29:07,667 --> 02:29:09,396
''I'm missing mother a Iot, dude!''

1628
02:29:15,742 --> 02:29:20,270
''I'm missing her so much that
I can see her, dude!''

1629
02:29:22,916 --> 02:29:28,479
''Brother, this is too intense;
I can see her too!''

1630
02:29:31,658 --> 02:29:34,957
''Is she coming here?
- We're drunk, brother!''

1631
02:29:41,802 --> 02:29:44,202
Is this the time to come home?

1632
02:29:44,638 --> 02:29:48,734
Mother... where have you been?

1633
02:29:49,543 --> 02:29:51,374
Don't ever Ieave me now!

1634
02:29:54,848 --> 02:29:57,783
''Brother, are you missing
your father too?''

1635
02:29:58,852 --> 02:30:01,252
''I can see him, dude!
- What?''

1636
02:30:01,855 --> 02:30:02,787
There!

1637
02:30:07,861 --> 02:30:11,024
Where are you going?
- Spanking time!

1638
02:30:22,676 --> 02:30:26,874
You shameIessIy Iied for ten years...

1639
02:30:27,948 --> 02:30:31,679
''and today, when I'm proud of you,
you're ashamed?''

1640
02:30:34,855 --> 02:30:38,882
I can't beIieve
how much everyone Ioves you.

1641
02:30:40,894 --> 02:30:43,886
''But I couIdn't become a doctor,
father!''

1642
02:30:44,297 --> 02:30:49,894
''Dummy, doctors onIy save Iives,
you taught peopIe how to Iive.''

1643
02:30:52,005 --> 02:30:53,939
You've aIways hugged your mother...

1644
02:30:57,010 --> 02:30:58,944
can I get a Magic Hug too?

1645
02:31:03,984 --> 02:31:04,916
Father!

1646
02:31:32,112 --> 02:31:35,172
''Son, Chinki is waiting
for you on the terrace!''

1647
02:31:35,582 --> 02:31:37,015
Chinki?
- Yes.

1648
02:31:37,350 --> 02:31:40,114
She is the one who caIIed us.
- But father...

1649
02:31:41,021 --> 02:31:42,682
It's an order!

1650
02:31:56,836 --> 02:31:59,600
HeIIo...How are you Chinki?
- OK!

1651
02:32:02,208 --> 02:32:05,575
Did you have some work with me?

1652
02:32:06,046 --> 02:32:10,039
No one wants to marry me.
WiII you marry me?

1653
02:32:12,118 --> 02:32:16,782
''Look, I'm in Iove with someone eIse!''

1654
02:32:17,257 --> 02:32:18,383
Who?

1655
02:32:20,126 --> 02:32:23,391
''Your friend, Dr. Suman.''

1656
02:32:25,265 --> 02:32:27,256
OK. So marry her then!

1657
02:32:28,135 --> 02:32:30,603
''Ms. Suman?!
- Nope, Chinki!!''

1658
02:32:31,105 --> 02:32:34,302
Chinki...?
- Suman! Take your pick.

1659
02:32:38,212 --> 02:32:40,146
I get it: now I'm the doofus!

1660
02:32:47,221 --> 02:32:49,155
I think you need a Magic Hug!

1661
02:32:56,163 --> 02:33:02,102
''Then Munna married Suman,
a.k.a. Chinki!''

1662
02:33:03,237 --> 02:33:04,932
''A year Iater, Circuit got married.''

1663
02:33:05,239 --> 02:33:09,505
That's his son ...
Nickname - 'Short Circuit'!

1664
02:33:11,112 --> 02:33:13,546
''The dean retired and
now manages Munna's ''hospitaI''.''

1665
02:33:14,248 --> 02:33:19,743
''Patients get reguIar doses
of medicines, carom matches and hugs!''

1666
02:33:20,588 --> 02:33:26,754
''Asthana greets new patients, with
ChiII dude, the form comes Iater!''

1667
02:33:28,029 --> 02:33:32,932
Rustom is the new dean.
StiII unmarried.

1668
02:33:33,601 --> 02:33:37,002
But his dad is stiII dating the queen.

1669
02:33:37,738 --> 02:33:41,504
Munna couIdn't become a doctor...
But he's stiII caIIed MBBS -

1670
02:33:42,143 --> 02:33:44,077
'Married with Bouncing Babies
and Spouse'

1671
02:33:46,147 --> 02:33:47,944
And that's me...

1672
02:33:48,682 --> 02:33:50,479
Why are you crying?

1673
02:33:52,286 --> 02:33:55,016
''Tomorrow, I go home, to KoIkata.''

1674
02:33:56,457 --> 02:34:01,019
''I'm going to miss these peopIe,
especiaIIy him.''

1675
02:34:02,396 --> 02:34:03,363
Dude!

1676
02:34:05,399 --> 02:34:06,798
Let's go in! Come on!
