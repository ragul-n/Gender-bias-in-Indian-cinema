Hey Srinu, why are you shouting in panic?

Do we shout only when we panic?We would shout if the bike is missing too.

00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,830
But who took the bike?

109

Why did you have to take Seenu's bike dear?

122
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,090
Didn't he tell you the reason himself?

Why is it actually?

124

Ask him to return thatamount and get the bike.

127
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,450
Leave it dear.Maybe he doesn't have the money.

128

He will return it when he can.

Ain't it?

144
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,370
You wouldn't get the bikeback until you pay the money.

145
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,080
You may leave now.

146
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,160
-Let's go uncle.-Hello, Raju Sir.

What's with you? You act like a tomboy.

155
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,270
How can you get thier bikes?

156
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,910
You got to do that these days.

157
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,290
You would end up losing the remainingproperty if you go with uncle's rules.

158
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,250
Tell me how much property weowned when you were newly married?

159
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,660
Around 100 acres.

160
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,750
How much of that is left now?

161
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,710
Is it 25 acres?

162
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,200
I guess so. That should be it.

163
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,370
What about the remaining 75 acres then?

164
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,710
That's lost to such idiotsbecause of Uncle's goodness.

165
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,750
Uncle, do you think you are thebrand ambassador to amiability?

166
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,580
You give away anything assoon as anyone asks you.

Hey, is it how you speak to uncle?

168
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,450
Oh it is!That's the result of all his pampering

He places his sister by his sideand his niece over his head.

170
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,500
What else woud she do?

171

Does he do it everyday?

Though we are staying away from them,we are always close to their heart.

He said it is not possiblewithout the acceptance of Siddhu.

00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,030
But he does not agree.

560
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,950
-What does he want?-I don't know.

561
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,530
Don't he understand,that you cannot live with him

Ask him whether he can do it or not.Otherwise, I will appoint a senior lawyer.

It's not about the formality.It is a tradition.

We are not gifting her a memory.Not an object.

621

Whenever she comes across that object,she would remember her wedding.

622

then she'll remember the valuewe have given to her wedding.

It's us who lose after the marriage.

715
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,610
How?

716
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,610
-What’s this?- Ice cube

717
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,240
This is a girl before marriage.

718
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,610
This is a man.

719
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,110
We get into his life onthe name of marriage.

720
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,780
-Now where’s the ice cube in this?-No where

721
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,200
So, we’ll have a name andidentity before marriage.

722
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,740
But once we get into the life of a man,it’s him everyhere.

723
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,650
Neither we nor our identity would exist.

724
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,200
Hey.

725
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,900
Do you have any such opinions over marriage?

726
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,280
-Hey, come. Sit down.-Hi Vasu.

727
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,780
Hi.

728
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,300
-Ain't this a boy now?-Yeah!

729
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,610
Ok, have it then.

730
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,280
How can we have it raw?It'll effect the liver.

731
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,990
Ain't this a girl now?

732
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,240
Have it now.

How do we get high on just soda?

734
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,450

Superb!

737
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
Life is similar.

738
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,010
Well the fun is only when whena male and female come together.

739
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,740
Parents give us birth.Friends give us happiness.

740
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,320
But a life partner gives us life itself.

741
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,230
It's okay even if you don't praise awedlock that gives you such a life partner.

742
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
but don’t insult it.

743
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,200
Ok.

744

I’m very sorry.

You should take care of business from now.

So, you go wherever you feellike for the next six months.

But no one should know that you’reRK’s daughter in these six months.

and abiding by it is likebeing successful in it.

929
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,570
Why are you changing theauspicious time for Minister Sir?

930
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,700
Minister Sir had come a long wayfrom Hyderabad for this marriage

931
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,610
We should look after his comfort too dear.

932

and another is leaving as he met you.

As I'm feeling bad about the visitors,why do you behave similarly Uncle?

939
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:53,110
Minister sir who stays in power just for 5years would swear at an auspisious moment.

Don't they who have to stay together fora lifetime need an auspicious moment?

01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:36,060
Haven't I said no onewould reject your choice?

1066
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:40,690
Hey Paddu. Your Brother-in-law sayshe is in love with a girl named Sri.

1067
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,020
I heard it Mother-in-law.

1068
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:44,270
You missed a golden chance.

1069
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,230
Did you pay heed to my words then?See it now.

1070
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,610
Why do you talk about it now grandma?

1071
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:48,750
What’s that in your hands?

1072
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,840
I brought some cheese cake asit’s brother-in- law’s favorite.

1073
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,810
You know what all he likes.You got it in at the right time.

1074
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,690
Feed some sweet to your brother in law.

1075
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:03,600
Congrats brother-in-law.

1076
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:04,810

My father.

1084

Please wash your feet.

1088

I mean, it’s our tradition to wash thefeet when we arrive from outside uncle.

1089
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:48,710
So, please.

1090
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:50,120
Give it.

This is the house built by our forefathers

-My sister, cousin.-Greetings.

1097
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:25,230
I got it. It’s a joint family.

1098

-Shall we sit?-Come.

1100
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,620
I need to check the house mom.

1101
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,020
Do you need anything dear?

1102
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,270
Kavya wishes to see the house.

1103
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,480
-Paddu. Show her the house once.-Ok grandma.

1104
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:43,480
Please come.

[Clearing throat]

1106
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,650
I have some important appointments.

1107
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,310
So,I would leave if you finish the formalities.

1108
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:54,900
What are you expecting?

1109
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,690
What’s there to expect?

1110
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:03,120
What I mean by expectations is, what theycalled dowry earlier, now as formalities.

1111
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,500
Tell me what do you need?

1112
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,100
I didn’t love Sri for that.

1113
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,900
You are talking like abusinessman even here.

1114
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,440
All of us didn’t agree for thismarriage expecting something.

1115
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,190
We agreed because myson likes your daughter.

1116
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,730
I too agreed for this marriageas my daughter has liked him.

1117
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,770
Now let's come to the point.

1118
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:28,900
It’s my habit to talk clearly aboutany matter right in the beginning.

1119
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,480
That is good in a way too.

1120
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,720
You’ve got two daughters

1121
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:35,040
the property is shared between them.Which means our boy gets half of it!

1122
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,150
Simple.

1123
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:42,970
I need to talk personally to you.

1124
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,480
We talk everything beforeeveryone at our home.

1125
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,310
But I need to talk personally.

1126
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:58,940
Come Uncle.

1127
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,100
You have to sign on this if youwant this marriage to take place.

1128
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,020
What is that?

1129
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,100
Premarital Agreement.

1130
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,730
It exists since long abroad, but guyslike me rarely use this in our country.

1131
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:22,100
By chance if my daughter wishes to take divorceafter marriage unable to adjust with you...

1132
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:26,400
Then,I can’t roam around you wasting my time.

1133
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:32,900
Why agree to this marriage whenyou don't have belief on our love?

1134
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:35,230
Belief is different, and truth is different.

1135
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,940
What your dad said out there is true.

1136
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:39,600
I think about anything like a businessman.

1137
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,900
In any business,I think of an exit right at the entry.

1138
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:45,620
And about my daughter’s marriage.

1139
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,910
So you think our marriedlife wouldn't be successful?

1140
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,040
Who knows?

1141
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,440
even if you take good care of my daughter

1142
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,500
Isn't there a chance that problemsmight crop up from another side?

1143
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:01,060
So, isn't it better that I be cautious?

1144
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,650
So, do you believe thesepapers more than our love?

1145
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,480
Its been long since the worldstarted believing papers than humans

1146
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:16,060
If at all my daughter and you arereally happy,these papers are nothing.

1147
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,270
It’s just a piece of paper.

1148
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,270
If you have so much confidence on your love,

1149
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,940
what is your problem toput just a sign on them?

1150
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:34,210

1153
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,770
Is your courage not enough?

1154
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:55,270
I’ve got enough courage uncle.

1155
01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:57,020
Then sign it!

1156
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,060
I will.

1157
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:02,440
You believe in papersand I believe on words.

1158
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:05,900
I’ll sign here if you give me a word.

1159
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:07,730
What’s that?

1160
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:12,150
You should be everywhere you arerequired as the bride’s father.

1161

You must do all the works you have to do.

1162

It’s ok for me to sign ifyou give me a word to do so.

1163
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,690
Won't I be present atmy daughter’s marriage?

1164
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:24,770
Ok.

1165
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:28,100

No uncle, your word is enough.

1168
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,100
Take it.

1169
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:45,520
By the way, this matter shouldstay only between both of us.

What business did you and yourfather-in-law have for so long?

1175
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,190
Nothing uncle.He had some doubts that I clarified.

1176
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,100
Is it ok for you now?

01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,100
Yeah okay.

1178
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,100
I have a wish.

1179
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,350
Being the bride’s family, you shouldget the marriage done where you wish.

1180
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:20,350

About what else? About our Vasu's marriage.

everything happens eventually.

1198
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,800
No,I don't agree to make it happen casually.

1199
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:29,210
Marriage should happen like a marriageand not like any normal function.

1200
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:36,000
Everything should go as per our traditionand it should remain a memorable one.

Days might have changed butthe traditions shouldn't.

Everyone feels happy and celebrate whenwe are born, we are not aware of it.

Everyone weeps and mourns after we die,we can't experience that too.

1205
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:53,170
The only time where we can see ourbeloved feel happy is during a wedding.

1210

-Can I say something?-Yeah

1211
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:14,210
Vasu is not correct for you.

1212

1219

and respecting each other is appreciable.

1220

He started from the office.He will be here soon.

01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,210
What brother-in-law? As a father, he shouldbe here first for his daughter's engagement.

1248
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,840
I doubt he might reach at thelast minute for the marriage

01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:53,210

It's just the ritual.Does it take five or ten minutes?

1265
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:31,300
We shouldn't link some traditions with time.

1266
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:34,380
Moreover,it's an engagement which is half of marriage.

1267

Please change to dhoti and come.we shall start.

Why?Can't I perform the rituals without dhoti?

Tell them clearly that I will bethere only on the date of marriage.

1708
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:49,680
Why do they want to arrive a day beforethe wedding when the wedding is in a week?

1709
01:38:55,540 --> 01:39:00,160
Do you know why all of ushave agreed for your marriage with Sri?

Because of our trust in you.

1711

I started thinking in your point of viewfor you coming a day before the wedding.

1750
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:13,350
As it would be a trouble for youto cancel so many appointments,

1751

1855
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:14,660
Hi grandma.

1856
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:16,150
Hi son.

1857
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,970
Are you seeing the 70 years of your life?

1858
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:20,690
Yes dear.

1859
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:23,900
Do you know,how happy I feel looking at all of them?

1860
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:26,420
You have made your life.I must make mine too.

1861
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:29,330
What do you mean?

1862
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:30,790
I will tell you what I mean.

1863
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:35,440
Mum, dad, uncle, aunt,everybody please listen.

1864
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:36,760
Sri, come here.

1865
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:43,310
All of you have seen the married life.

1866
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:44,550
We are yet to see.

1867
01:48:44,990 --> 01:48:50,190
So, we want to know about marriage,and life after the marriage.

1868
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:51,360
Why do you want to know now?

1869
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:52,200
We need them uncle.

1870
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:54,190
We are attending every other marriage.

1871
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,520
We are participating in the events.

1872
01:48:57,270 --> 01:48:58,810
But after coming back home,we forget everything.

1873
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:00,980
We don't feel we've been to a wedding.

1874
01:49:02,190 --> 01:49:05,190
When I was a kid,grandma told me that marriage is a festival.

1875
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:08,440
Such a marriage should give lot of memories.

1876
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:11,480
I have seen so many of my friendsand colleagues who are married.

1877
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:14,940
Fear about wife.Anger on husband.

1878
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,980
Getting divorce for small time egos.

1879
01:49:19,150 --> 01:49:22,400
So, if you tell us aboutyour memories and experience.

1880
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:24,980
We will learn how to exist after marriage.

1881
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:29,270
Grandma, please start.

1882
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:31,560
How can I say so suddenly?

1883
01:49:32,350 --> 01:49:33,310
It's ok, you start it.

1884
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:35,900
Your grandfather used to say

1885
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:39,270
The way we treat our parents,who are responsible for our birth

1886
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:42,710
we should treat the wife, who is responsiblefor our children's birth similarly.

1887
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:46,690
Then, their relationshipwill be beautiful forever.

1888
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:48,440
Treat her in the same way son.

1889
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:52,150
[Claps]

1890
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:53,940
Next!

1891
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:56,960
-Father-in-law, it is your turn now.-Me?

1892
01:49:58,030 --> 01:49:58,500
Alright.

1893
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:01,160
Dear, give me that tab.

1894
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:07,040
Relationship between a wife andhusband is like the letter 'W'.

1895
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:11,570
At the earlier stage of their marriage life,the love between them will be at the peaks.

1896
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:18,100
Later it decreases due to children or inthe process of settling down in career.

1897
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:27,040
Again, their love graduallyincreases, as children are grown up.

1898
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:33,830
After that, due to children's weddings andto settle them down, their love decreases.

1899
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:35,690
Once they are done withtheir responsibilities

1900
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:42,730
as they are left for each other, the lovebetween them will increase to the peak.

1901
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:48,090
It means, love between a husband and wifewill start at peaks and ends at the peaks.

1902
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:53,480
Those who neglect obstacles which comein between and understand each other

1903
01:50:54,190 --> 01:50:56,710
their lives would be filled with happiness.

1904
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:02,200
Like us.

1905
01:51:03,110 --> 01:51:08,340
[Applause]

1906
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:11,370
Father-in-law it's your turn.

1907
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:13,670
[Clearing throat]

1908
01:51:14,910 --> 01:51:17,500
Life will be happy,if you just listen to your wife.

1909
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:21,410
I listen to your aunt,so we don't fight with each other.

1910
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:24,790
I listen to you too,so we don't have fights.

1911
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,580
Its your turn now father-in-law.

1912
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:31,290
Me?

1913
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:32,490
Please say.

1914
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:35,700
I will tell.

1915
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:37,870
-She will say.-Okay. Please start.

1916
01:51:42,410 --> 01:51:49,330
A girl shares her feelings withher parents till certain age.

1917
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:55,160
Then, with her brothers,sisters, friends and colleagues.

1918
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:59,250
Like this each one of them willtake care of her at each stage.

1919
01:51:59,790 --> 01:52:05,660
But, the one who takes all theseresponsibilities collectively is a husband.

1920
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,910
Vasu, we women need small happy moments.

1921
01:52:13,830 --> 01:52:20,330
We cook for hours together and forgetall our toil when husband appreciates.

1922
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:27,660
When Sri was born,your uncle was happy seeing her.

I like you a lot.

1957
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:14,540
I thought of proposing my love as soonas you come back from Hyderabad.

1958
01:56:16,790 --> 01:56:22,200
But before I could,you revealed your wish at home.

I love you so much.

01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:31,450
I was dreaming aboutmarrying you and staying back here.

I feel that is my place whereSri is getting ready at my home.

Whatever it is happening about thismarriage, I feel that should happen for me.

1963
01:56:48,790 --> 01:56:53,330
Since childhood grandma used to saythat brother-in-law is your husband.

1964

If she could say evenonce that I was your wife

you might have thought the same about me.

Isn't it Brother-in-law?

1967
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:11,370
I always take you as my sister-in-law.

1968
01:57:13,580 --> 01:57:17,000
Even if I did not love Sri,I would have told you the same thing.

02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:48,600
Whether the wedding is at my homeor otherwise, it is just an event.

2096
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:56,150
I felt silly, when you asked meto attend all the wedding related work.

2097
02:07:58,770 --> 02:08:02,310
Because, I never knew weddings involvejourney that includes all these things.

2098
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:04,600
Not just me but,many people don't know about it.

2099
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:10,020
Assigning the wedding works tosuch event management comany

2100
02:08:10,810 --> 02:08:14,230
or thinking it wouldn't be good if we don'tattend when someone invites us for a wedding

2101
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:18,100
or with an obligation unable to skipbecause we have some work with them

2102
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:20,850
I used to attend themarriages to mark an attendance.

2103
02:08:21,650 --> 02:08:26,730
It is done if you get a picclicked with bride and groom.

2104
02:08:28,150 --> 02:08:31,770
I don't even know tobless them wholeheartedly.

2105
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:48,980
People like me who search for a tissueto wipe hands after blessing the couple,

2106
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:51,440
understand when attending such a wedding

2107
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:56,430
Behind those sacred rice,

2108
02:08:58,230 --> 02:09:03,470
there is the love of a fatherwho wets the rice, dries them

2109
02:09:04,170 --> 02:09:06,060
and apply turmeric powder to them.

2110
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:13,190
And that there's the responsibility andthe bonding he has with his daughter.

2111
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:22,560
When I asked him about having a lotof relatives, He told me a word about it

2112
02:09:23,650 --> 02:09:26,900
If we want everyone,we will have a lot of people.

2113
02:09:27,190 --> 02:09:30,480
If we think we are fine withourselves, we would be alone.

2114
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:34,350
Then I came to know that, how lonely I am.

2115
02:09:35,150 --> 02:09:38,980
and what a mistake I have done in thecase of my elder daughter's marriage

2116
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:48,230
My wife, used to just congratulate mewhen I told her about bagging a big project.

2117
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:50,660
I could not see happiness in her eyes.

2118
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:54,520
But,when I spent about just 5 minutes for her.

2119
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:56,970
and selected being her husband

2120
02:09:57,990 --> 02:10:00,470
and bought her a saree,I saw how happy she felt.

2121
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:11,650
I could not see happiness in my daughter'seyes even after I gifted her a costly car.

2122
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:17,150
But,when I was just writing Om on the screen,

2123
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:25,150
when I was bringing sand for the prayers.

2124
02:10:28,980 --> 02:10:30,560
I saw happiness in her eyes.

2125
02:10:33,190 --> 02:10:38,150
I, who wanted to be present in everyone’shouse, failed to be in my own house.

2126
02:10:40,150 --> 02:10:42,190
But you all are present in everyone's house.

2127
02:10:49,650 --> 02:10:55,560
I felt I would be a great father if Igive money and property to my daughter.

2128
02:10:57,350 --> 02:11:03,100
You made me to do every work related towedding and conveyed what a father is

2129
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:04,850
Thank you Vasu.

2130
02:11:06,150 --> 02:11:11,520
I did not understand when you said you thinkabout the others from their point of view.

2131
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:16,060
Knowing that,this is just a piece of paper.

2132
02:11:17,690 --> 02:11:20,350
and when it is not required todiscuss about this to everyone.

2133
02:11:22,020 --> 02:11:26,520
You said sorry withhonesty towards your people.

2134
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:29,810
You are well mannered.

2135
02:11:31,230 --> 02:11:32,440
You are well mannered.

2136
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:45,850
My friends used to tell me that, the onewho will marry your daughter is lucky.

2137
02:11:46,730 --> 02:11:47,600
No Vasu.

2138
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:52,900
I am lucky to get you as my son in law.

2139
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:58,150
Please forgive me for hurting you.

2140
02:12:00,690 --> 02:12:01,650
Please forgive me.

2141
02:12:02,310 --> 02:12:04,230
Apologies are not required between us.

2142
02:12:04,980 --> 02:12:07,060
The reason marriages are nothappening as they have to

2143
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:10,190
And the reason we are distancingourselves from relationships

2144
02:12:10,980 --> 02:12:13,650
Should be understood byeveryone just ike you did.

2145
02:12:15,690 --> 02:12:21,630
Relationships don't last if we reject themand traditions don't last if we leave them.

2146
02:12:23,970 --> 02:12:24,750
Come dear.

2147
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:26,600
Give me a minute dad.

2148
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:35,270
Before going there, you should forgiveme for hiding this truth from you.

2149
02:12:36,770 --> 02:12:37,650
Sorry Sri.

2150
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:40,890
Is a sorry enough forhiding such a big truth from me?

2151
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:42,220
What else do you want?

2152
