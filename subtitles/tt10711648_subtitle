even imagine may happen'

'One such incredible story...is mine'

5
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:11,358
Sir, 'caste' and 'religion'
haven't been filled in this form

6
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:17,775
- What is 'caste', son?
- I don't know, pa

7
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:21,775
We are teaching them
something they are clueless

8
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:25,442
Let my son grow up equally with
his classmates oblivious of all this

9
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,233
I won't fill up those details, thanks

10
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:39,400
That's all
Job over

00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:43,692
He loves wasting time on Sundays
claiming to make Dhokra statuettes

12
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,191
We should do the work we love
even if people criticize us

13
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:50,442
It will always come in handy

14
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,191
Why is that broken, pa?

15
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,150
This piece, huh?

16
00:02:57,608 --> 00:03:01,483
This is handed over in our family
to the person they love

17
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:04,692
My father gave it to me
I am giving it to you now

18
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:06,817
'I was thrilled to bits'

19
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:08,108
'Then what?'

20
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,233
'This proved I am appa's favorite'

21
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,567
Thanks, pa

22
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,733

'Whatever our activities
we were into it as a gang'

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,525
'We used to save money for a week
to buy vermicelli popsicle'

30
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,150
'Hey! Ice, da'

31
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:36,650
'Remember, we used to hire cycles
and bike everywhere?'

32
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:38,150
'Rs 3 for 1 hour'

33
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:47,817

00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:49,941

38
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:00,859
Phone for Usha

39
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:03,024
'Phone for Usha it seems'

'Even if these antics were small
our happiness was gigantic!'

[sit or stand game]

42
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:11,941
Why are you crying?
What happened?

43
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:16,233
She broke appa's shaving mirror
She's scared he will beat her up

44
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:18,608
Oh! Don't worry, dear

45
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,442
I'll tell appa it was a mistake

46
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:23,150
Come out for a minute

47
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,275
Why were you just watching her cry?
Shouldn't you be consoling her?

48
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:32,400
I know anyway appa will punish her

49
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:34,442
How can I console her?

50
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,733
Listen to me

51
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:41,275
If someone cries in front of us
or confides their worries

52
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:43,400
...they are not expecting us to solve it

53
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:45,400
Won't someone hold their hands and say

54
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:47,817
'I'm there for you
Don't be scared'

55
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:50,442
These are the only words
of comfort they expect

56
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:54,692
To them it isn't important
what you can or can't do

57
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,442
But the reassuring words
you speak at that time

58
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,108
'I'm there for you'

59
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,150
That is important
Do you understand?

60
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:04,150
Okay, go

61
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:05,608
Reassure her now

62
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:10,983

What is this new practice
of taking attendance?

84
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:50,442
Is it the end of the 3 'R's, revelling,
rejoicing and reacting to girls?

85
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,191
Ravi, this section is only till

How are you so sure
this is her house?

114

'Machan, attendance register has
all the contact details, right?'

115
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,275
'I flicked it'

116
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:12,525

From now on I'll show swag in school"

I'm the school don for every season"

146
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:58,692

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,733
'This school is going down the drain
only because of you!'

179
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,983
- Thank you
- 'Super joke, Mani'

180
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:53,983
Nib broke, eh!

181
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:57,983
That was...my joke

182
00:12:59,191 --> 00:13:04,483
"Just for effect I'll pile book on book
When you pass by flirtatiously I'll look"

183
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:09,483
"I'll act the goody-goody dude
Given a chance I'll brush against you"

184
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:14,692
"Like an ink bottle is your heart I know
Filled with love waiting to overflow"

185
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:19,859
"My pen waits here for ink to flow
Love is my spring for life to glow"

186
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:25,358
"Eyes like marble mesmerize me
My mind spark(le)s like roll caps zappy"

187
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,483
"Hearing her voice on the phone
sleepless nights I spent alone"

188
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:35,608
"I'll stand with guts to surpass
the boys from the next class"

189
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:40,733
"If any fellow tries to act funny
I'll break his teeth, watch me"

190
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:45,692
"I make a fuss for no rhyme or reason
I'm the school don for every season"

191
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:51,108
"Rain or shine I show off mighty
I'm the don in this school almighty"

192
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:04,024
- I'll profess my love today
- Okay

193
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:06,941
- I'll tell her later
- Okay

194
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:12,108
"Call her to the canteen daily
Ask her to pay my bill duly"

195
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,316
"When she passes by, yell out Ravi"

196
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:15,775
- I will
- Tell later

197
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:20,608
"I am the last bencher in class as a rule
From now on I'll show swag in school"

198
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,567
You want to tell her later, right?

199
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:29,983
"I make a scene without reason
I'm the school don for every season"

200
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:35,316
"I show off for no reason whatever
I am the school's don hereafter"

201
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:50,817
"I make a fuss for no rhyme or reason
I'm the school don for every season"

202
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:55,733
"Rain or shine I show off crystal clear
I'm the don in this school, my dear"

203
00:14:58,567 --> 00:14:59,567
What is this?

204
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,191
I intend teaching how to
make such Dokhra statuettes

205
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,775
- Wow! Soooper!
- You like it?

206
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:05,400
- Take it
- No...no

207
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:12,024
I've brought my camera

208
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,108
Can I take a photo of all of you?

209
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,150
'That's his agenda!
Photo...let's pose'

210
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:17,525
'Don't stamp my foot'

211
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:19,859
'Suresh, sit down
Don't hide us'

212
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:21,983
So this 'bhajji' shop is the venue, huh?

213
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:24,650
Yes, this is the venue

214
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:26,400
Want to know why?

215
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:31,442
He comes here daily, rain or shine
irrespective of the weather forecast

216
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,442
Every single day without fail

217
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,316
Because

218
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,733
...he is hypnotised by
the fritter shop lady's hip

219
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:57,358
'If we must kill Gaaja, he should not
be aware of himself or his surrounding'

220
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,859
'Only when he looks at her waist and hip
he will be in a trance'

221
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,733
When she finishes frying onion fritters
and takes the raw banana to slice

222
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:10,608
...for 60 seconds she'll be
in a bent posture

223
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,567
She slices the onion standing straight

224
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:14,650
She slices the banana like this

225
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:17,692
So in that 1 minute
she takes to slice the banana

226
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:20,983
...he will be totally oblivious
of what is happening around him

227
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:22,483
Bro, I'm so sorry

228
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,150
'It was sheer accident, bro'

229
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:29,358
If she bends to slice the banana

230
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:31,817
...we have only 1 minute
to spring into action

231
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:34,024
'We must do our job
before she slices the banana'

232
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,692
'We enter the fritter stall'

233
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,400
You pick the knife she has used

234
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:40,442
Because he shouldn't have
any weapon within his reach

235
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:42,608
'The three of us go
and sit next to him'

236
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,150
'You pick the knife we've brought
and one swift blow'

237
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:47,859
'Fritter lady will be shell shocked'

238
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,066
We clear the crime scene
of our evidences

239
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,733
'And scoot as fast as we can'

240
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,442
Suppose our plan misfires?

241
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:56,859
Even then the fritter lady
will be shell shocked

242
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,358
Tell me why?

243
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,316
'Watching Gaaja kill him'

244
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:04,066
How the hell will it misfire?

245
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,567
No way, bro
I'll kill him

246
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,692
- So tomorrow?
- Yes

247
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,608
21st century

248
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,442
I'll be the new don Gaaja

249
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,733
Tomorrow?

250
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:14,400
Yes, machan

251
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,525
1999, December 31st

252
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:22,150
If I propose tomorrow, we will be
the 1st pair of lovers in 21st century

253
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,983
Sounds cool, right?

254
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:26,316
I've asked her to meet me
near Sona Bakery

255
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:27,483
Sona Bakery?

256
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:30,442
Kissing spree from tomorrow, huh?

257
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:33,108
- 1-4-3, eh?!
- Don't tease me!

258
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,692
It's a private joke
You do your job, teacher

259
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,541
Hey! He's waiting for you

260
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:57,000
Jolly times ahead!

261
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,417
He's coming
Gaaja's coming

262
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,417
What's your tearing hurry?

263
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,582
Raw banana fritters

264
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,083
Time to enter

265
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,708
Hi

266
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,666
Hi

267
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:07,958
Where's he-

268
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:13,417
Slice it real thin

269
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,375
'Come on, you tortoise'

270
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:17,166
'Next plan is to finish you off!'

271
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:22,833
Now take that knife-

272
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:25,417
I was about to say
'Stab him when she bends'

273
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,582
Why are you messing up like this?

274
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,000
Hey! Take that knife

275
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,083
'Bro, wait'

276
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,708
'That banana is reducing in size'

277
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:36,417
Take...hurry up

278
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:38,666
For me?

279
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,125
You said you like-

280
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,375
You said you like it, right?

281
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,333
Our family custom, we give this
to whomever we like the most

282
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,000
This is from me to you

283
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,708
Take the knife out, da

284
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,958
Don't waste time

285
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,250
- I'm telling you to give it to me
- Bro, not that!

286
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,125
Let go of my hand, you idiot!

287
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:25,166
Finish him
Finish him off!

288
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,958
I thought if any object breaks
its life ends at that point

289
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,958
But when I saw you and
my heart broke, I understood

290
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,666
Only after that a new chapter
has begun in my life!

291
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,291
'Grab something heavy'

292
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,874
Smash his head

293
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,291
Not oil, you moron!

294
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,541
Hey! Super, da

295
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,958
Clear the evidence at once

296
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,250
- Bro, how to go in this crowd?
- Pick that up

297
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,958
Okay, what are you
trying to tell me now?

298
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,375
No-

299
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,708
I-

300
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,624
I...

301
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,375
I love you!

302
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:49,958
I-

303
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,375
Oh gawd!

304
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,375
Romance happening here

305
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,166
Whatever happens,
love is blind?

306
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,208
Weapon!

307
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll stab her with this
Don't come near me

308
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,833
Don't take another step
This is really sharp

309
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:02,000
I'll kill her
Go away

310
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,125
I'll stab her for sure

311
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,291
Don't hurt her

312
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,791
- Let go of her
- Get on to the bike

313
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,916
- Nikitha!
- 'Start the bike'

314
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,125
Go...go

315
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,749
'Faster...faster'

316
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:23,000
Happy New Year!

317
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,958
Next Gaaja of the world!

318
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:28,417
'Office calling'

319
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,083
Mani...?!

320
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,125
Yes, I'm Mani

321
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:57,791
Beard-

322
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,833
Hey...wait!

323
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,749
It's alright, machan

324
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,666
Wait...wait
Hear me out

325
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,708
Relax, don't get perturbed

326
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:09,000
Listen to me

327
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,291
Ma...?

328
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,874
Our uncle has woken up, ma

329
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,708
- Sister!
- Bro, listen

330
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:29,833
Wedding chain

331
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,417
Brother

332
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,666
No

333
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,250
Dream...it's all a dream

334
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,666
Listen to me for a second

335
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:45,125
You had slipped into coma until now, da

336
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,333
Coma...?

337
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:49,499
A lorry hit you that day, right?

338
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:54,041
'We rushed you to the hospital'

339
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,624
'You lost a lot of blood'

340
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:58,041
'Your brain didn't get enough blood'

341
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,125
'Doctors said you had slipped into coma'

342
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,666
'He said either in a few days
or in a few months you'll wake up'

343
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,083
'That doctor retired
But you never recovered'

344
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:09,333
'Because the hospital charges
hit the roof, we brought you home'

345
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,791
'I took such good care of you
making sure not even a fly bothered you'

346
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:16,000
Hey! How often I've told you
not to sweep the ant powder?!

347
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,417
If an ant bites, you'll scream
Can he do the same?

348
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:19,582
Get out!

349
00:25:19,624 --> 00:25:21,250
As an IT staff
I'm telling you, out!

350
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:25,083
'Only the calendar changed every year
But there was no reaction from you'

351
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,125
'Even then, I took care of you like a baby'

352
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:30,541
'Bathing you, applying powder,
changing your Huggies'

353
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:32,708
- 'Huggies?'
- I couldn't clean you up

354
00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:33,916
My hand hurt

355
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:36,333
As usual I was keeping an eye
on you today too

356
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,208
Looking at you
Reading the paper

357
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,166
Action replay

358
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,958
'But I didn't notice the tyre enter, da'

359
00:26:01,874 --> 00:26:03,791
'I should've let an ant
bite you right then'

360
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:04,958
My fault!

361
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:09,000
Ho...how many days have I been like this?

362
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,499
2 x =

363
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,541
Just 16 years, da

364
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:14,791
SIXTEEN YEARS?!

365
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,749
Hey!

366
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,541
Which year are we in?

367
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,708
2016

368
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,499
2016

369
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,666
Not lying to me, are you?

370
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,000
Of course not

371
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:41,375
1 second

372
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:47,541

'We will make India
a super power within 20 years'

374
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,333
Hey! This is 1996

375
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,541
Whom are you trying to fool?

376
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:58,708
They keep repeating this every year
Take a look now

377
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,624
He has locked 500 and 1000 rupee notes
and has released 2000 notes

He works selflessly for our welfare'

379
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,541
Who is your husband, dear?

380
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:22,000
Machan!

381
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,916
Who is my bro-in-law?

382
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:26,874
My dear bro-in-law!

383
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,166
'Looks like he will slip into coma again!'

384
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:36,083
How come, da?

385
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,541
I told her that joke, machan!

386
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:45,958
'Then mozhi, Kani mozhi, Ilam mozhi...!'

387
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,250
'This is my joke
Trust me'

388
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,791
'Copyright mine, only mine'

389
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:55,541
She became happy
I became her husband

390
00:27:55,582 --> 00:27:57,000
- Appa
- What, da?

391
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,874
Ant bit me, pa

392
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,041
- Apply slaked lime paste
- It hurts badly, pa

393
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,208
Go and do it

394
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,000
I did the same as a toddler!

395
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,666
Father...where's my father?

396
00:28:06,874 --> 00:28:08,000
Appa

397
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,958

398
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:22,958
Ma...my mother?

399
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,417
Amma is here

400
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:27,417
She's in the next room
I'll fetch her, okay?

401
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:55,541
Ravi...?

402
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,166
- Amma!
- What happened, Ravi?!

403
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,333
I'm scared, ma

404
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,417
You'll be fine, my son

405
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:04,208
- I'm scared, ma
- Ravi

406
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,958
- Ravi
- I'm sooooo scared, ma

407
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,333
Aiyo! God help me

408
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,499
Oh my God!

409
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:15,375
- I'm really scared
- You're fine now

410
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:17,208
Nothing to worry, dear

411
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:15,166
[episode of 'Chithi']

412
00:30:16,624 --> 00:30:18,333
'Chithi' is still being telecast?

413
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,833
'Aiyo! Save him!'

414
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,041
'He's going to die
He's dead now'

415
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,333
What happened?

416
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:27,000
Revive him
Get a buggy

417
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,791
Look, squad has come

418
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,333
Fatso! Kill them

419
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:32,000
Grab the loot and kill him, da!

420
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,666
- 'Stop playing, will you come to eat?'
- Mysskin, let's go

421
00:30:44,624 --> 00:30:47,791
If you press and swipe up
it will get unlocked

422
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,791
Oh! Is it enough if we just touch?

423
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:51,417
Just a touch will do

424
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:55,125
Your aunt has invited you
for the baby shower

425
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:58,166
- Has my aunt come?
- Hey! Stop

426
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,041
WhatsApp, invited us
on the family group

427
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,083
Whats-

428
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,541
Is it dull?
Low battery

429
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:06,250
Here's the trimmer
We must go for your check up

430
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:08,166
Do you know how to use this?

431
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,874
My father had one

432
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,375
Shave like your father did
Wear his dress, it will fit you well

433
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:14,624
1st take a shower

434
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,250
Know how to bathe, right?

435
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:22,749
Don't be scared

436
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:24,291
That's my son Mysskin

437
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,166
He won't talk to anyone, go

438
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:30,208
Go, da, his head has to be tonsured
at our family deity's temple

439
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:36,166
My friend has come out of coma
after 16 years, sir

440
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:39,624
I'll take him for a check-up
and attend office tomorrow, sir

441
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,791
'Bro, I'm ready'

442
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:51,541
I thought you'll be like Jayam Ravi
You look like 'Nizhalgal' Ravi

443
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:53,791
This is the trend now

444
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,291
Do that again

445
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,417
Soooper!
Come on

446
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,958
Chennai has become like America

447
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:17,291
America?

448
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,375
Do you know how America is like now?

449
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:21,958
'It is so hot and
so much of traffic?'

450
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,333
'- I can't bear this heat
- This is the cold season'

451
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,749
'You haven't seen Chennai in May
Everyone will strip even their pants!'

452
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,250
See...our school students?

453
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,499
Same dumb faces!

454
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:44,375
How is Nikitha?

455
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:46,000
Which Nikitha?

456
00:32:46,582 --> 00:32:47,958
My girlfriend, I say!

457
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,208
That girl, huh?

458
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,041
She must be married and
with a son as tall as you

459
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,624
Extend your right hand

460
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,541
Hey! I feel like seeing her

461
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,166
Flat tyre!

462
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,666
I want to meet her, da

463
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:17,916
Are you mad or what?

464
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:19,333
I told you she's married!

465
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,791
Please

466
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,166
Who else do I know?

467
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,125
I'll just go see her once

468
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,666
Ask her, 'Are you fine?'

469
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:26,749
That's all!

470
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,582
Don't blabber!
Just shut up

471
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,041
- For my sake-
- You're next, sir

472
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,208
- Excuse me, sir
- Yes

473
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:36,958
Good morning

474
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:40,166
Oh my God!!

475
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,083
I can't believe this

476
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:44,666
He came out of his coma?

477
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,708
No chance

478
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,333
Please sit down

479
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,958
His legs are fit to dance?!

480
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:57,208
'How did this happen
with my treatment?'

481
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,916
- Do it
- Do it, da

482
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,417
Wow! Good

483
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,375
Good...nice

484
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Do it

485
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,125
Let me do this
instead of him

486
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:17,250
I'm good at it

487
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,582
"With your eyes expressive"

488
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:20,916
Do it

489
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,250
Perfect!

490
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,333
Were you consulting
this doctor all along?

491
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,417
- He's a good doctor
- Take that tablet

492
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,541
Tab, bro
Samsung tablet!

493
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,499
16 year lag, right?

494
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:40,166
That's how you'll react!

495
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,208
I'll send you a patient by name Ravi

496
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,958
Do a full body check up

497
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:50,041
There's no problem
He's totally fine

498
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,250
Super, doctor

499
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,624
Akka, sit down

500
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,083
Careful

501
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:03,000
Did no one accompany you?

502
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,041
No, only my husband

503
00:35:05,624 --> 00:35:07,708
He had some important work to attend

504
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,916
- I slipped
- No...it's fine

505
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:12,624
- Shall I get you some water?
- No, thanks, I'm okay

506
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:13,791
But

507
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:15,958
2 points to remember

508
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,291
What is it, doctor?

509
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:21,541
First of all, at heart he is still
a 17 year old youngster

510
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,208
What happened?

511
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,041
You seem off color

512
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,791
I've lost 16 years of my life

513
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:34,250
I don't know what to do now

514
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:38,874
20 years for me

515
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,417
We've been childless for 20 years

516
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:51,250
But...it was my husband
who suffered the most

517
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,083
You know how badly
we were humiliated?

518
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,499
We used to wonder
why we were even alive

519
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,291
It hurt that much

520
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:09,417
But...we believed in God

521
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:11,250
He did not let us down

522
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,417
After 20 long years

523
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,708
Have faith in God

524
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,749
He'll take care of you, trust me

525
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,208
2nd point

526
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:35,166
He is bound to be most
psychologically affected now

527
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,333
Take a look

528
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:39,375
He didn't hear the alarm buzz

529
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:42,749
'So he woke up 15 minutes late
and missed his interview'

530
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:45,791
'Now he can't get back
the 15 precious minutes he lost'

531
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,582
'Neither can he attend that interview'

532
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:50,083
'Look how it manifests
as a terrible temper'

533
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,083
If this is the reaction
for just 15 minutes

534
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:56,166
He has lost 16 long years of his life

535
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,666
He must have had
a long wish list then

536
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:01,791
He is likely to get angry and
depressed he has missed all that

537
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:05,250
So if he wishes
for something, fulfill it

538
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,708
- Got it?
- Okay, doctor

539
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,166
Or else he might repent
thinking 'Why am I alive?'

540
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:10,499
One day he may-

541
00:37:12,582 --> 00:37:14,499
Or to someone else
near him, he might-

542
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:16,666
Even you, he may-

543
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:18,666
- Doctor?
- Fun!

544
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,250
Oh shit!

545
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,291
'Don't do it, da!'

546
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,624
Will you take your medicine
or shall I inject you?

547
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,291
- Take it, kiddo
- Shall I stab you?

548
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,125
Do it...do it...just do it

549
00:37:45,749 --> 00:37:47,541
Shut up your mouth, nurse

550
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,499
- What now?
- I want to see her

551
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,083
I have to see her now

552
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,749
- Doctor
- Fulfill his wish

553
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:56,916
Or else-

554
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,582
No worries
Let's see her now

555
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:03,000
Whether the year is 2000 or 3000...

556
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:05,958
...we friends are here to
unite you with your girlfriend

557
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,666
We'll definitely go, eh?

558
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Don't do that
I get the jitters

559
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,083
What is this?

560
00:38:19,582 --> 00:38:20,916
Facebook, I say

561
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,958
Before coma only emails , huh?
You won't understand ABC of this

562
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:28,791
Bro...this is like a park, da
Like a meeting place for all

563
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,417
You can talk to any girl
Cops won't hassle you

564
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:33,499
What you ate
What film you watched-

565
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:37,208
Even when they die they will inform
on this page and only then die

566
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,250
I intend searching for
your Nikitha in this park

567
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:42,083
My Nikitha won't frequent such parks

568
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:44,417
Will she be with some chap
in Marina beach?

569
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:46,208
My son is 3 years old

570
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,041
My son and wife roam around
only in this park

571
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:52,624
My wife is with some chap
in this park even after midnight

572
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,749
I don't even know
who that intruder is

573
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:58,291
If I send her a friend request she messages
'I'll kick you with a broomstick!'

574
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,041
How did you raise a sister like this?

575
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,958
- Okay, go ahead and search
- What a notorious family!

576
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:05,541
I've forgotten her face

577
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:08,083
- How does she look?
- Simply superb!

578
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:11,000
She was superb then
I'm sure she will be so-so now

579
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:15,708
Some heroine's photo, or rose or
chrysanthemum will be her display picture

580
00:39:15,749 --> 00:39:17,000
Some vague photo

581
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:19,041
Watch me nab her in this park!

582
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,417
Bro...that's her
My Nikitha!

583
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:25,291
Studied at SVSS-

584
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:27,000
100% sure this is Nikitha

585
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:28,874
- Yes
- But everything is different!

586
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:30,417
Even I noticed that

587
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,166
Check in Phoenix Mall!

588
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,666
Bro, she has checked in
We can find her, hurry up

589
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,333
What's check in, bro?

590
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,375
Check in is telling the world
where you are!

591
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,125
Why is she announcing that?

592
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,541
Then her character is doubtful

593
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,375
Let us ask her
face to face, hurry up

594
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:48,666
She has informed the whole world
she is not at home

595
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,666
What if a thief breaks in then?

596
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:54,582
I'm racking my brains how we can
find her in that huge Phoenix Mall!

597
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,749
Hey! I've traced her in
Spencer's Plaza that's even bigger!

598
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,749
- What?!
- Spencer's Plaza

599
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:01,624
He's killing me with his ignorance!

600
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:03,833
Bro, that's Phoenix Mall

601
00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:06,125
Your sister comes here often
without my knowledge

602
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,208
Oh mall!

603
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:13,125
Bro, stop
That car

604
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,749
- Look, that's Nikitha
- Where, da?

605
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:16,041
But she has changed

606
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,958
Really? Then I must
check her out too

607
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,582
She's like your sister
Stop drooling

608
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:21,708
- Hands off!
- She's mine, follow her

609
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:23,874
She has gone
Go...go

610
00:40:25,582 --> 00:40:27,333
- Speed up
- Hey Nikitha!

611
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:29,000
- Go...go
- Wait, da

612
00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:36,708
Why are all the houses carbon copies?

613
00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:38,250
That's row house for you

614
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,125
We'll ask someone here

615
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:50,000
- We'll just see her, right?
- Simply see, that's all

616
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:52,874
- Then that dance?
- Just like that

617
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:56,166
- Just like that?
- Yes, jest for fun!

618
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,041
Okay, come on

619
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,460
'Undertaker, you are a Labrador
'You can't howl, silence!

620
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:05,668
Hey...hey!

621
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:08,210
- Doctor...you?
- What brings you here?

622
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:11,418
We came to meet someone
living in these row houses

623
00:41:11,543 --> 00:41:12,627
- Here?
- Yes

624
00:41:12,668 --> 00:41:14,210
- Who is it?
- Nikitha

625
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:15,668
Sounds very familiar

626
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:17,126
Full name?

627
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:20,126
- Nikitha Krishnamurthy
- Tell me, she is my wife

628
00:41:20,293 --> 00:41:22,085
Can't be, she's my girlfriend

629
00:41:23,293 --> 00:41:24,335
What is he saying?

630
00:41:24,377 --> 00:41:27,335
Doctor, he is saying
your wife is his girl

631
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:28,794
Whaat?

632
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:30,752
What the hell are you talking?

633
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:32,543
Aiyaiyo! Sorry, doctor

634
00:41:32,585 --> 00:41:33,918
I'll get it right this time

635
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:35,293
What he means is

636
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:37,418
...your wife is not his love interest

637
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,460
But he is interested in your wife
What the luck!

638
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:41,585
He got it this time

639
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:43,959
- Hey, are you crazy?
- Yes

640
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,876
Are you mad or what?
Nikitha!

641
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,001
What, doctor?

642
00:41:48,377 --> 00:41:49,710
She...she-

643
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:51,085
She is my wife

644
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:52,710
What are you blabbering?

645
00:41:52,752 --> 00:41:53,752
'Ravi...?!'

646
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:21,460
Doctor, before his coma
he was in love with Nikitha

647
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:23,502
That's why I brought him over, doctor

648
00:42:28,085 --> 00:42:30,001
Sir, you were the one who suggested

649
00:42:30,043 --> 00:42:31,752
All his wishes should be fulfilled

650
00:42:31,794 --> 00:42:33,585
- That's why, sir
- So?

651
00:42:33,794 --> 00:42:35,168
He wished for my-

652
00:42:36,668 --> 00:42:37,918
Go to your room now

653
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,710
Doctor, is she our child?

654
00:42:42,335 --> 00:42:43,335
My child!

655
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:45,251
I was curious
She didn't resemble you

656
00:42:48,752 --> 00:42:51,377
You didn't come
even once to see me, right?

657
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:54,335
No...I thought you were dead!

658
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:56,918
They were discussing
about mercy killing

659
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:59,335
- 'She got me into trouble'
- Mercy killing?

660
00:43:00,293 --> 00:43:01,377
2 times

661
00:43:01,752 --> 00:43:03,585
Kidney and liver will go waste, that's why

662
00:43:03,627 --> 00:43:05,627
Who gave you the right to decide?

663
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:07,794
If we had asked you,
would you have decided?

664
00:43:09,502 --> 00:43:11,710
Sir, can we both talk in private?

665
00:43:12,627 --> 00:43:14,794
Stuffing your feet into your mouth!

666
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:19,126
Sir, they want to discuss about their love

667
00:43:19,168 --> 00:43:21,168
Why don't we have tea
at the street corner?

668
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:22,876
Sorry, sir

669
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:25,168
Whatever it is, ask her in front of him

670
00:43:26,168 --> 00:43:28,794
I can ask whatever
right in front of him, huh?

671
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,251
- What would you have said?
- What?

672
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:38,043
You were about to reply
when I professed my love to you

673
00:43:38,126 --> 00:43:39,876
What were you planning to say?

674
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:41,001
Tell me

675
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:42,794
Come on

676
00:43:57,418 --> 00:43:58,918
I would have said 'no'

677
00:43:59,085 --> 00:44:01,126
Hey! Don't be scared
uncle is here

678
00:44:01,168 --> 00:44:03,293
Asking out of curiosity
What would you have said?

679
00:44:03,335 --> 00:44:04,377
No...no

680
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:05,668
Thank God!

681
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,377
You say yes now, as if
I'll force you to elope with me?

682
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:10,043
Let go of her hand!

683
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:15,085
Not eloped as yet?

684
00:44:16,085 --> 00:44:19,043
Come here, none of you
had better leave this place

685
00:44:22,377 --> 00:44:24,460
Hey! Why are you
behaving like a lunatic?

686
00:44:24,502 --> 00:44:26,335
- It's just infatuation
- Don't lie

687
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:27,377
The day I proposed

688
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:29,627
I saw your eyes feel shy,
lips smile and nose twitch

689
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:31,543
Even I have not seen
my wife react like this

690
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,418
This is private conversation
Keep out of it

691
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,585
- She is my wife
- I'm her lover, sir

692
00:44:35,627 --> 00:44:38,293
Hey! Letting your tongue run
because I'm keeping quiet

693
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:40,210
I'm telling you
I didn't love you!

694
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:47,710
1st get out of here

695
00:44:48,627 --> 00:44:50,710
Coming here like an idiot
after 16 long years

696
00:44:51,377 --> 00:44:53,794
He was stupid enough
to bring you, leave now

697
00:44:54,543 --> 00:44:58,001
If I ever step near your front door
you can spit on my face!

698
00:44:58,043 --> 00:44:59,293
Spit on his face too!

699
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:00,377
Let's go

700
00:45:01,418 --> 00:45:03,460
I'll spit on your face
for sure if you come again

701
00:45:03,502 --> 00:45:05,377
'Thinks he's superman or what?!'

702
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,043
'Undertaker, shut up'

703
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:20,752
So what if she isn't in your life?

704
00:45:20,794 --> 00:45:22,418
She's past expiry date

705
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,335
But I'm still shelf worthy, right?

706
00:45:24,377 --> 00:45:28,794
I was the one who taught you how
to hook a girl and make the right move

707
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:31,210
You were our friend, philosopher and guru

708
00:45:31,502 --> 00:45:33,377
So what if she isn't my girl!

709
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:35,710
By the time I snap my fingers,
I'll find another chic-

710
00:45:36,876 --> 00:45:39,293
Want to see a sample of my skill?

711
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,418
Want to see me in action?

712
00:45:42,585 --> 00:45:45,668
How many years it has been
seeing you like this, come on

713
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,335
She is also eyeing you
Go for the kill, show your skill!

714
00:45:48,377 --> 00:45:49,377
Watch me now

715
00:45:49,377 --> 00:45:54,001
"I make a scene without reason
I'm the school don for every season"

716
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,210
"Rain or shine I show off mighty"

717
00:45:56,251 --> 00:45:59,043
After 16 years I'll see you
in action only now

718
00:45:59,085 --> 00:46:00,668
Go...go...!

719
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,043
- Sis, please move aside
- 'Please go'

720
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,794
Excuse me

721
00:46:15,335 --> 00:46:16,794
What is the time now?

722
00:46:18,085 --> 00:46:19,460
Ehhhhh!

723
00:46:21,585 --> 00:46:23,335
- When is 13B bus expected?
- Sorry

724
00:46:23,377 --> 00:46:25,335
- Come on
- I'm in your neighboring school

725
00:46:25,543 --> 00:46:27,085
Why are you cradle snatching?

726
00:46:27,126 --> 00:46:29,668
What is the time?
When is T.Nagar bus due?

727
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,668
This is how you strike a conversation

728
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:32,959
- Those are-
- Listen

729
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,251
- Watch me now
- What?

730
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:39,001
"Won't the breeze that blows know
the flower waiting to bloom aglow?"

731
00:46:39,085 --> 00:46:40,794
[song from 'Ullasam']

732
00:46:40,918 --> 00:46:43,543
Follow for a month without any break

733
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:46,377
- That is it
- You'll be branded a psycho killer!

734
00:46:46,377 --> 00:46:47,377
Come, da

735
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:48,585
'Sit down'

736
00:46:48,627 --> 00:46:51,126
'Dropping a letter
and staring like Cupid!'

737
00:46:51,168 --> 00:46:54,001
'Flinging a flower and smiling
like a Casanova are all...here'

738
00:46:57,001 --> 00:47:00,377
Tamil romantic films of the late 90s

739
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:01,418
This is love

740
00:47:02,335 --> 00:47:03,418
That is not love

741
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,794
'Alai Payuthe'

742
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,377
'- What are you searching?
- Wedding chain'

743
00:47:07,377 --> 00:47:09,627
How can she hang
her wedding chain like that?

744
00:47:09,668 --> 00:47:12,460
These days they fall in love
hiding their own children!

745
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:14,335
Okay...love

746
00:47:14,377 --> 00:47:15,377
'Kushi'

747
00:47:20,293 --> 00:47:21,293
Waist

748
00:47:21,335 --> 00:47:24,418
'Kushi' was a box office hit
for that tempting waist!

749
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,752
'Vallavan'

750
00:47:26,168 --> 00:47:27,377
Seems to be a good man

751
00:47:27,418 --> 00:47:28,627
- Is that so?
- Play this

752
00:47:28,668 --> 00:47:31,210
'- Can't wait, where is the bedroom?
- Upstairs'

753
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:38,001
Hey! This isn't love
Not love at all!

754
00:47:38,043 --> 00:47:39,918
Yes, but nowadays this is only love

755
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:42,335
Hey, you haven't watched
'OK Kanmani', right?

756
00:47:42,377 --> 00:47:44,710
You would have scooted
Sit quiet now

757
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,959
Everything moves fast these days

758
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:49,168
You should also be fast

759
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,460
- I'll be sooooper fast
- So quick...ly!

760
00:47:51,543 --> 00:47:54,418
Listen, we can go fast
but in reverse direction

761
00:47:54,502 --> 00:47:58,251
After this, if you meet a girl
and fall in love with her

762
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:01,001
Then you figure out
your castes differ and break up

763
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:03,168
- After that can you find a girl?
- No way

764
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:04,627
That's why this laptop

765
00:48:04,668 --> 00:48:05,959
Look at this

766
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:08,959
Mudaliar matrimony
Chettiar matrimony

767
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:10,210
Iyer matrimony

768
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:12,585
Do people still obsess about caste?

769
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:14,418
You haven't read
the newspapers, right?

770
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,168
They openly advertise in public
only about caste

771
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,085
But I don't belong to any caste

772
00:48:19,126 --> 00:48:20,543
Blame your father for it!

773
00:48:21,043 --> 00:48:24,043
Okay then, the bride
I'll find for you...

774
00:48:24,085 --> 00:48:26,085
...is a girl listed as 'caste no bar'

775
00:48:26,126 --> 00:48:30,210
Which means all castes not outcast!

776
00:48:32,043 --> 00:48:33,168
Aiyaiyo!

777
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,794
Why is it empty?

778
00:48:36,085 --> 00:48:37,460
Can't find here either

779
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:39,043
Looks like it's a dead end!

780
00:48:39,168 --> 00:48:40,710
'Not here either!'

781
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,959
'Tamil matrimony'

782
00:48:45,918 --> 00:48:48,377
Finally lucky!
One and only ducky!!

783
00:49:13,043 --> 00:49:14,043
Reethika...!

784
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:16,085
She is Divya's friend

785
00:49:16,502 --> 00:49:17,710
Hey, sit down

786
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:20,043
Even if you know her
shouldn't talk in person

787
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,043
1st send a 'Friend request' on Facebook

788
00:49:25,876 --> 00:49:28,377
- That is one stage
- No, I feel like puking

789
00:49:28,543 --> 00:49:30,460
After sending the 'Friend request'

790
00:49:30,502 --> 00:49:32,377
...you must get
her WhatsApp #

791
00:49:36,335 --> 00:49:37,418
This is one stage

792
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:42,627
After 2 messages, I have
no clue what to chat

793
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:45,377
Then you go to the next stage

794
00:49:45,502 --> 00:49:47,710
First click her #
on your 'Contacts' list

795
00:49:47,794 --> 00:49:49,418
'Her phone will ring'

796
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,710
'Her ears will hear it'

797
00:49:50,794 --> 00:49:52,085
'Eyes will look'

798
00:49:52,126 --> 00:49:53,418
'Her feet will walk towards it'

799
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,876
'Her hand will pick up the phone
and her finger will swipe'

800
00:49:55,918 --> 00:49:57,335
- 'Her lips'
- Hello!

801
00:49:57,377 --> 00:50:03,377
"No Gandhi photo on this rupee can I see
What to do, only your face smiles at me"

802
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:06,377
"I went to the temple
I saw no deity or idol"

803
00:50:06,418 --> 00:50:09,794
"I want you, only you
My Goddess statue"

804
00:50:15,293 --> 00:50:21,126
"I want only you, my love so endearing
Accept milk and fruits as my offering"

805
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:26,460
"Scented camphor I'll light for you
I want you daily in my life anew"

806
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,585
"Are you ready?"

807
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:47,335
"Are you ready?"

808
00:50:50,377 --> 00:50:53,543
Actually 1st time even I saw you
only in that birthday party

809
00:50:53,627 --> 00:50:55,460
'You seemed really different'

810
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:58,210
'Everyone there was busy
with their mobiles'

811
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:00,585
'You were the only one
talking to the guests over there'

812
00:51:00,627 --> 00:51:01,668
'I liked that'

813
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,502
You also looked unique to me

814
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:04,543
'Why?'

815
00:51:04,627 --> 00:51:06,335
Even the so-so girls were escorted

816
00:51:06,377 --> 00:51:07,668
'But you came by yourself'

817
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:10,085
Only because some girls
like you are still single...

818
00:51:10,126 --> 00:51:12,377
...few chaps like me are still alive!

819
00:51:13,794 --> 00:51:20,293
"No need of lipstick for your honeyed lip
Your moonlit eyes need no kohl as fillip"

820
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:28,752
"I treasure you in my heart
as the most precious part"

821
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:32,251
"In my eyes you seem to be
Miss World to me"

822
00:51:37,752 --> 00:51:43,627
"Faced love failure long ago
First love went amiss you know"

823
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:49,959
"I yearn to be loved, my dear
I'll cherish you in my palm sincere"

824
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,794
"I promise, trust me"

825
00:51:53,585 --> 00:51:56,043
"I swear on myself truly"

826
00:51:56,418 --> 00:51:58,710
"I swear on you, my lovely"

827
00:51:58,794 --> 00:52:01,377
"Cough it out, idiot
Cat got your tongue, is it?"

828
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:04,377
"No one can hold a candle to you"

829
00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:07,126
"We are 'made for each other' true"

830
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:10,377
"My life took a detour, girl
Roller coaster ride swirl"

831
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:13,668
"I want only you
No one else will do"

832
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:31,210
"No Gandhi photo on this rupee can I see
What to do, only your face smiles at me"

833
00:52:31,293 --> 00:52:34,293
"I went to the temple
I saw no deity or idol"

834
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:37,959
"I want you, only you
My Goddess statue"

835
00:52:38,043 --> 00:52:44,210
"I want only you, my love so endearing
Accept milk and fruits as my offering"

836
00:52:44,251 --> 00:52:49,210
"Scented camphor I'll light for you
I want you daily in my life anew"

837
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:52,168
"No one can hold a candle to you"

838
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:55,168
"We are 'made for each other' true"

839
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:58,043
"My life took a detour, girl
Roller coaster ride swirl"

840
00:52:58,085 --> 00:53:00,959
"I want only you
No one else will do"

841
00:53:01,085 --> 00:53:04,043
"I want you daily in my life anew"

842
00:53:04,168 --> 00:53:06,959
"Only you, my true blue"

843
00:53:07,043 --> 00:53:09,918
"I want you daily in my life anew"

844
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:13,377
"Only you, my true blue"

845
00:53:17,251 --> 00:53:18,627
Got into the mood?

846
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:21,710
Next stage is meeting

847
00:53:21,752 --> 00:53:22,794
Which means?

848
00:53:23,585 --> 00:53:24,794
I'll handle that

849
00:53:31,085 --> 00:53:33,168
I should unlock it like this

850
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,918
This is to take a selfie

851
00:53:35,043 --> 00:53:37,001
Then ATM PIN #

852
00:54:08,585 --> 00:54:10,377
Aiyo! Your jeans is torn

853
00:54:10,377 --> 00:54:12,085
Everybody is looking

854
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:14,293
- Everyone is-
- They go about their work

855
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:15,543
We attend to ours

856
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,418
No one will bother about anything

857
00:54:17,585 --> 00:54:19,251
Anyway, hiiii!

858
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,752
It seems when you meet
for the 1st time, they take a selfie!

859
00:54:26,794 --> 00:54:28,168
Okay, sure

860
00:54:28,377 --> 00:54:29,418
Okay

861
00:54:44,377 --> 00:54:46,668
'Everything moves fast these days'

862
00:54:46,752 --> 00:54:48,293
'You should also be fast'

863
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:49,418
Fast

864
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,335
'They go about their work'

865
00:54:51,377 --> 00:54:52,502
'We attend to ours'

866
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:54,418
'No one will bother about anything'

867
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:57,293
'I'll also move fast'

868
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,543
'Fast move'

869
00:54:59,585 --> 00:55:01,710
'Ban the Beep song'

870
00:55:09,918 --> 00:55:12,627
'Ban the Beep Song
that shames women'

871
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:14,418
CHEE!!

872
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:19,251
Bloody scumbags!
Won't you spare a single girl?

873
00:55:20,001 --> 00:55:21,168
Hey!

874
00:55:21,293 --> 00:55:22,293
'Hands off!'

875
00:55:22,377 --> 00:55:23,585
She wanted to be kis-

876
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,794
Slipper this mongrel!

877
00:55:25,918 --> 00:55:28,210
'Won't you let a girl walk
safely on the road?'

878
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:29,460
Listen to me

879
00:55:29,502 --> 00:55:32,085
'Why are you torturing us women?'

880
00:55:32,126 --> 00:55:34,710
'Call yourself a human being!
Kissing a girl in public!!'

881
00:55:34,752 --> 00:55:36,668
Please hear me out

882
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:39,959
'You should be beaten black and blue
Weren't you born with sisters?'

883
00:55:40,752 --> 00:55:42,585
Divya, isn't this your brother?

884
00:55:42,627 --> 00:55:44,210
'He has to pay for this sin'

885
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:46,168
'He's sucking her lips with his!'

886
00:55:48,502 --> 00:55:49,794
Hey! Let's go

887
00:55:52,377 --> 00:55:56,876
'Video of a girl being forcefully kissed
in broad daylight in a public place'

888
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:58,460
'Are women secure?'

889
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:01,085
'Women's Associations protest'

890
00:56:02,918 --> 00:56:05,377
Your brother? Looks like
he's from a decent family?

891
00:56:05,418 --> 00:56:06,918
'He's such a Casanova!'

892
00:56:06,959 --> 00:56:10,251
'Releasing him because of your pleas
Or else I would've arrested him'

893
00:56:10,293 --> 00:56:12,377
'Rascal! Take him away'

894
00:56:14,794 --> 00:56:15,794
Sit down

895
00:56:22,543 --> 00:56:24,794
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, huh?

896
00:56:26,794 --> 00:56:28,627
I feel so humiliated

897
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,959
How old do you think you are?

898
00:56:31,335 --> 00:56:33,168
'Still running behind girls!'

899
00:56:34,126 --> 00:56:36,377
What are you doing with your life, huh?

900
00:56:36,794 --> 00:56:38,085
Are you working?

901
00:56:38,543 --> 00:56:40,126
Simply fritter away time and-

902
00:56:41,752 --> 00:56:44,126
'My husband is working
his butt out for you also'

903
00:56:44,752 --> 00:56:45,959
Get this into your head

904
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:48,585
Singlehanded he took care of
your medical expenses

905
00:56:49,668 --> 00:56:50,752
1 minute

906
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,710
Do you know what this is?

907
00:56:57,335 --> 00:56:59,251
Duplicate document of this house

908
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:01,627
We don't have the original

909
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,502
At one point unable to
pay your medical bills...

910
00:57:04,543 --> 00:57:06,543
...we took a loan from the bank

911
00:57:06,627 --> 00:57:08,460
Unable to pay that bank loan...

912
00:57:08,502 --> 00:57:10,668
...this house is about to be seized now

913
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:16,418
Do you know how many people
dream to own a house?

914
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,335
This house is our dream

915
00:57:24,418 --> 00:57:27,377
We have to fend for our 2 children
and their education

916
00:57:27,668 --> 00:57:31,210
In case we come to the streets
along with our children

917
00:57:31,668 --> 00:57:33,668
...no one is responsible for it

918
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:34,959
Only you!

919
00:57:36,794 --> 00:57:38,377
This little boy

920
00:57:39,085 --> 00:57:42,502
We still don't know why
he doesn't talk to anyone

921
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:46,710
Entire apartment complex
looks at him weirdly

922
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:51,335
My husband and I take him
to one psychiatrist after another

923
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,085
'You're adding insult to injury now!'

924
00:57:55,126 --> 00:57:56,668
The moment boys turn 20

925
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:00,126
...they will be so ashamed to
ask their parents for money

926
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:02,794
You are 34 years old!

927
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:05,460
Will you please keep quiet today?

928
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:11,502
Even now only that man
provides you food

929
00:58:12,293 --> 00:58:13,710
Do you know why?

930
00:58:15,168 --> 00:58:18,460
Because you are my brother
and that is the only reason

931
00:58:19,585 --> 00:58:21,710
Please try and get a job for yourself

932
00:58:23,794 --> 00:58:25,959
Why the heck did you
come out of your coma!

933
00:58:44,794 --> 00:58:45,794
Dai!

934
00:58:48,126 --> 00:58:51,460
Why didn't you tell me about your loan?

935
00:58:51,543 --> 00:58:53,377
You've already lost half your life

936
00:58:53,418 --> 00:58:55,251
How will it help if I tell you?

937
00:58:55,377 --> 00:58:56,794
But one small correction

938
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,585
I didn't do any of this
because you're her brother

939
00:58:59,668 --> 00:59:01,001
You are my friend!

940
00:59:08,918 --> 00:59:10,752
I must find myself some job

941
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,627
Please do that

942
00:59:33,377 --> 00:59:35,335
Haven't you taken a photo
for many years?

943
00:59:35,377 --> 00:59:36,876
- Yes, sir
- Why?

944
00:59:37,251 --> 00:59:39,418
I was in coma for 16 years

945
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:40,752
Coma?

946
00:59:42,585 --> 00:59:43,585
Good

947
00:59:43,668 --> 00:59:44,668
Sounds good

948
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,001
- Where is Coma?
- In Canada, didn't you know?

949
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:49,543
Now I remember
My cousin lives there

950
00:59:51,377 --> 00:59:53,043
'Don't you feel ashamed?'

951
00:59:53,085 --> 00:59:55,293
Either you vacate the house
or repay the loan

952
00:59:55,335 --> 00:59:57,543
'You know how to avail a loan
Does it hurt to repay?'

953
00:59:57,585 --> 00:59:59,377
'And we have to run behind you?'

954
00:59:59,377 --> 01:00:00,585
'What a wild goose chase!'

955
01:00:00,627 --> 01:00:02,752
'I am asking you
And you're staring at me?'

956
01:00:02,794 --> 01:00:04,210
'We have to put an end to this'

957
01:00:04,251 --> 01:00:06,126
'We must seal this house this month'

958
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:08,293
'You got all the comforts
But can't repay?'

959
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:10,752
- Planning to cheat us?
- Pay up, sir

960
01:00:10,794 --> 01:00:12,752
You make handmade statuettes?

961
01:00:12,794 --> 01:00:16,210
We are at different level nowadays
with machine and 3D printer

962
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:19,418
When will you make it
and when will I be able to sell it!

963
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:23,085
Even to secure an office boy's job
you need to have computer knowledge

964
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:27,126
'Scored only 70% in 10th grade
You haven't completed 12th grade'

965
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:29,210
'Sir, how many times to tell you?'

966
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:31,377
'Don't stand here, sir
We have no vacancy'

967
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:34,168
'- Please go, sir
- Talking of floppy disks now!'

968
01:00:34,627 --> 01:00:37,794
'You don't know what an 'app' is?
How will you deliver food?'

969
01:00:47,168 --> 01:00:49,502
Give me the balance
I have to go, bro

970
01:00:49,918 --> 01:00:52,210
Hey! This is only the balance

971
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:54,377
2 tea is 20 bucks
1 cigarette is 15 bucks

972
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:55,918
What balance do you want?

973
01:00:55,959 --> 01:00:57,418
It was just tea then
Now it is GST!

974
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,794
- 20 bucks?!
- Wait, bro

975
01:00:58,876 --> 01:01:00,543
- Don't make me hit you
- Take, bro

976
01:01:22,377 --> 01:01:24,085
Want to fly a kite with me?

977
01:01:29,377 --> 01:01:30,543
Did he get a job?

978
01:01:35,418 --> 01:01:37,627
Will you come and eat, anna?

979
01:01:55,918 --> 01:01:57,377
Sorry, anna

980
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,418
Aiyo! It's alright, dear

981
01:01:59,918 --> 01:02:01,794
No, I'm really apologizing, bro

982
01:02:01,876 --> 01:02:03,752
I just lost my temper and-

983
01:02:04,377 --> 01:02:05,377
Sorry

984
01:02:05,627 --> 01:02:06,794
I understand

985
01:02:07,502 --> 01:02:09,418
Whatever you said makes sense

986
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,502
I've really become
good-for-nothing

987
01:02:14,335 --> 01:02:17,627
Everyone is either a doctor,
engineer, salesman, driver

988
01:02:17,668 --> 01:02:19,210
Some sort of identity

989
01:02:19,543 --> 01:02:22,418
But I have nothing to my name

990
01:02:22,668 --> 01:02:24,126
Don't be so pessimistic

991
01:02:24,168 --> 01:02:25,460
You are very talented

992
01:02:25,502 --> 01:02:27,293
You used to make statues

993
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:30,502
I can't even get a biscuit
for your son with that skill!

994
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:32,710
I believe 1 cup of tea is 20 bucks

995
01:02:32,752 --> 01:02:35,251
Bro, I'll tell you something

996
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,627
- You won't get me wrong?
- Go ahead

997
01:02:38,251 --> 01:02:40,918
In my friend's office...

998
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:44,001
...there is a vacancy for a watchman

999
01:02:44,335 --> 01:02:45,543
Will you go?

1000
01:02:54,752 --> 01:02:56,293
Yov! What are you doing?

1001
01:02:56,335 --> 01:02:59,377
No, sir, this is similar
to my school uniform

1002
01:02:59,418 --> 01:03:02,752
Wear your gloves, check and
send them in like how I demonstrated

1003
01:03:02,794 --> 01:03:04,627
Forever making silly excuses!

1004
01:03:08,876 --> 01:03:12,251
What I'm about to do
will make you feel awkward

1005
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:14,001
Likewise me too

1006
01:03:14,043 --> 01:03:15,335
But it's my job

1007
01:03:19,126 --> 01:03:20,293
Bro...?

1008
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:21,876
Bro...!

1009
01:03:22,293 --> 01:03:23,794
- Bro
- What is it?

1010
01:03:23,876 --> 01:03:25,043
What?
Go inside

1011
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:30,043
'Oh my God!'

1012
01:03:30,085 --> 01:03:31,418
'Look who is here!'

1013
01:03:32,752 --> 01:03:33,876
Yov!

1014
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:35,668
- Where are you going?
- No

1015
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:36,876
Do your job...go

1016
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,418
But you shouldn't misbehave with girls

1017
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,585
Will all the girls be
like your friend Reethika?

1018
01:03:42,627 --> 01:03:44,502
That friend I mentioned is Reethika!

1019
01:03:46,585 --> 01:03:47,710
I have to check

1020
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,126
Enough...enough

1021
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,377
- I must check what is in there
- I said enough

1022
01:04:01,418 --> 01:04:03,460
I must follow orders
I have no other choice

1023
01:04:03,502 --> 01:04:05,335
You have to check only men, go

1024
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,377
Even here, you won't
let me do the job I like

1025
01:04:12,876 --> 01:04:14,210
- Listen
- What?

1026
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:16,627
- Want to check before I leave?
- No, not at all

1027
01:04:17,043 --> 01:04:20,752
Many paintings in this museum
get sold for a hefty sum I heard

1028
01:04:20,794 --> 01:04:22,918
I painted these when I was young

1029
01:04:23,001 --> 01:04:24,752
How much will they fetch?

1030
01:04:25,377 --> 01:04:27,085
- Rs 200
- That's all?

1031
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:30,001
All these together 50 bucks

1032
01:04:30,043 --> 01:04:32,168
Do you know how artistic sense should be?

1033
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:33,460
Should be like that

1034
01:04:35,377 --> 01:04:37,293
That's for 5 million!

1035
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,126
This is art?!

1036
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:44,085
Don't hold a grudge and
reduce the rate drastically

1037
01:04:44,126 --> 01:04:45,710
Very funny!
Listen

1038
01:04:45,918 --> 01:04:48,085
I was angry with you, it's true

1039
01:04:48,126 --> 01:04:51,418
But I understood after your sister
explained everything to me

1040
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,335
That was a pure act of innocence

1041
01:04:53,377 --> 01:04:56,085
So I have no specific dislike towards you

1042
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:58,959
Only because I like you
I came to see you the other day

1043
01:04:59,001 --> 01:05:02,418
But like a madcap if you ask me
to quote a price, what can I do?

1044
01:05:02,585 --> 01:05:04,168
True, I am mad!

1045
01:05:04,585 --> 01:05:06,876
I'm in a pathetic position now

1046
01:05:07,126 --> 01:05:11,001
That's why I'm clutching at straws
I'll somehow find a way out!

1047
01:05:11,043 --> 01:05:12,043
Oh!

1048
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:14,876
But it was a tad too pathetic!

1049
01:05:17,794 --> 01:05:19,460
[alarm blaring]

1050
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:22,251
I suspected right then
you were hiding something

1051
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,085
- Lift your hands
- Not me

1052
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:25,794
That's the building alarm

1053
01:05:26,126 --> 01:05:27,794
Something has been stolen

1054
01:05:33,085 --> 01:05:35,043
- Go and call the police
- Okay

1055
01:05:59,335 --> 01:06:00,710
Cops are on their way

1056
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:02,043
They are coming, right?

1057
01:06:02,085 --> 01:06:03,335
'On their way!'

1058
01:06:13,752 --> 01:06:15,251
He seems to be quite the pro!

1059
01:06:19,251 --> 01:06:20,627
Yuck! Don't lick me

1060
01:06:20,752 --> 01:06:21,794
Hello, police?

1061
01:06:32,168 --> 01:06:34,085
Wait, take me also

1062
01:06:36,752 --> 01:06:38,001
'Give it'

1063
01:06:42,585 --> 01:06:44,126
Oh God! The statue!

1064
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:47,335
Do you know the value
of what you're holding?!

1065
01:06:47,377 --> 01:06:48,543
10 million!

1066
01:06:48,585 --> 01:06:49,794
- Don't let go!
- 10 million?

1067
01:06:49,876 --> 01:06:50,959
Hold it tight

1068
01:06:51,001 --> 01:06:52,293
I'll hold it tight

1069
01:06:52,335 --> 01:06:53,794
Did you call the cops?

1070
01:07:12,418 --> 01:07:14,293
'The cops have arrived'

1071
01:07:14,335 --> 01:07:16,126
Sir, these are the culprits

1072
01:07:16,168 --> 01:07:18,043
Sir, you still come
only at the last minute?

1073
01:07:18,085 --> 01:07:19,210
Very good

1074
01:07:22,876 --> 01:07:25,210
Thank God, it is worth millions

1075
01:07:26,377 --> 01:07:28,168
It belongs to the royal dynasty

1076
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:31,377
Everyone is filing a petition
claiming ownership now

1077
01:07:31,668 --> 01:07:33,710
You'll be shocked when you look at it

1078
01:07:59,293 --> 01:08:00,377
Got a good look?

1079
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,959
Didn't I say you'll be shocked?

1080
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:03,794
Thank God! Good job

1081
01:08:04,126 --> 01:08:06,752
Yov! This belongs to me

1082
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,460
Hey...hey...!

1083
01:08:10,668 --> 01:08:12,585
IT BELONGS TO ME!

1084
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:15,876
- Ravi, stop!
- What are you doing?

1085
01:08:25,539 --> 01:08:27,998
Yes, of course
This statuette was in our house

1086
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,831
So you really belong to a royal family?

1087
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,539
- Royal family?!
- Appaaaaa!

1088
01:08:31,581 --> 01:08:32,622
This family?

1089
01:08:33,455 --> 01:08:34,747
Don't be too shocked

1090
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:36,998
That's history
Done and dusted!

1091
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:40,831
For many generations now
we are a very normal family

1092
01:08:40,872 --> 01:08:43,080
And your father...oh God!

1093
01:08:43,122 --> 01:08:45,747
'All people are equal'
and his ideologies!

1094
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:49,706
But I swear I didn't know
that statuette would be so priceless!

1095
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:51,998
Appa!

1096
01:08:52,872 --> 01:08:54,539
Waste of a father-in-law!

1097
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:56,706
Why is this so valuable?

1098
01:08:56,747 --> 01:08:57,872
Come, I'll tell you

1099
01:08:57,914 --> 01:09:00,330
- Appa, throw me again
- I'm going out

1100
01:09:00,372 --> 01:09:02,122
Hey! Play 'throw me' game with him

1101
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,539
He is the reason
King Ellisai

1102
01:09:09,414 --> 01:09:12,956
'You belonged to the Ellisai kingdom'

1103
01:09:12,998 --> 01:09:14,789
'An ancient dynasty'

1104
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:17,664
'Beyond wealth, treasures,
bravery and prosperity...'

1105
01:09:17,747 --> 01:09:23,289
'...they were pioneers in designing weapons
to be used in everyday life'

1106
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:24,664
'That is...'

1107
01:09:25,831 --> 01:09:28,956
'They are famous for the ancient art
of making 'Dhokra' statuettes'

1108
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,330
'Your lineage was destroyed by-'

1109
01:09:30,372 --> 01:09:31,414
I know how

1110
01:09:31,455 --> 01:09:32,956
With the advent of the British

1111
01:09:32,998 --> 01:09:34,998
No, you were destroyed by womanly wiles

1112
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,539
Your royal family had
a weakness for women, da

1113
01:09:37,622 --> 01:09:39,414
Weakness for women?

1114
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:43,998
'B.C 136
The Harem'

1115
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:47,497
You said you liked it

1116
01:09:48,455 --> 01:09:49,706
My gift to you

1117
01:09:51,622 --> 01:09:52,956
If you like it, take it!

1118
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,289
'B.C. 1070'

1119
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,414
If you like it...take it!

1120
01:09:57,455 --> 01:09:58,789
'B.C. 1169'

1121
01:10:00,455 --> 01:10:02,747
How did you lose that statuette?

1122
01:10:02,789 --> 01:10:04,706
'B.C 20th century'

1123
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:06,289
'You like it?
Take it'

1124
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:09,372
It isn't important now
how I lost our heirloom

1125
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:11,205
It is important to find out
who has it now!

1126
01:10:11,247 --> 01:10:13,080
Your Majesty
Shut up, da!

1127
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:14,831
Who has it now?

1128
01:10:14,872 --> 01:10:16,414
A politician has it

1129
01:10:16,581 --> 01:10:17,914
MLA...?

1130
01:10:17,956 --> 01:10:19,747
This is Breaking News now

1131
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:26,455
'Owner of a statuette belonging to
the royal family, worth millions'

1132
01:10:26,497 --> 01:10:29,956
'...is Dharmaraj, MLA of Sigalapatti
according to our sources'

1133
01:10:29,998 --> 01:10:31,956
'Imprisoned for a corruption scandal'

1134
01:10:31,998 --> 01:10:33,998
'...he was released only last month'

1135
01:10:39,998 --> 01:10:45,080
'There are many murder, kidnapping
and kangaroo court cases against him'

1136
01:10:53,497 --> 01:10:55,789
'His original name is Dharma'

1137
01:10:55,831 --> 01:10:57,747
'He was arrested in
Gaaja's murder case'

1138
01:10:57,789 --> 01:10:59,455
'...is of specific interest'

1139
01:11:11,122 --> 01:11:17,372
You must all be aware of my royal lineage
from my heroic deeds and brave conduct

1140
01:11:17,414 --> 01:11:21,247
There's no necessity for me
to prove it with that statuette

1141
01:11:21,289 --> 01:11:28,414
But there are almost 100 petitions
from people claiming ownership it seems

1142
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:30,581
Do you know what it reminds me of?

1143
01:11:30,581 --> 01:11:31,581
See for yourself

1144
01:11:31,622 --> 01:11:33,163
Actor Dinesh is my son!

1145
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:35,414
Somehow unite him with me, his real mother

1146
01:11:35,455 --> 01:11:38,163
- Actor Dinesh is really my son
- My son

1147
01:11:38,789 --> 01:11:39,956
Did you see that?

1148
01:11:39,998 --> 01:11:41,872
'That actor is my son'

1149
01:11:41,914 --> 01:11:44,080
'I am chief minister's daughter'

1150
01:11:44,122 --> 01:11:46,414
This claim is as comical

1151
01:11:46,455 --> 01:11:51,372
I have just one fact to share
with those 100 petitioners and clowns

1152
01:11:51,414 --> 01:11:54,956
Many duplicates can exist
But there's only 1 original

1153
01:11:54,998 --> 01:11:56,872
And that is Dharmaraj!

1154
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,831
I'll send that statuette
on the 20th of this month...

1155
01:12:00,914 --> 01:12:02,706
...to our Govt for inspection

1156
01:12:02,747 --> 01:12:04,581
After I get Govt approval

1157
01:12:04,622 --> 01:12:08,956
...I'll donate that statuette
to the Indian Govt for free

1158
01:12:08,998 --> 01:12:12,956
Whaaat?! Who is giving
whose Dhokra to the Govt?

1159
01:12:12,998 --> 01:12:14,122
Politics...!

1160
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,914
He will earn much more
than the value of this statuette

1161
01:12:16,956 --> 01:12:18,497
On top of this
caste votes

1162
01:12:18,581 --> 01:12:22,956
Those who belong to the royal lineage
will mostly fall within 3 communities

1163
01:12:22,998 --> 01:12:26,414
These 3 communities claim
Dharmaraj is their man

1164
01:12:26,455 --> 01:12:28,163
And are fighting
within themselves

1165
01:12:28,205 --> 01:12:32,872
To put it simply, Dharmaraj gets
the support of these 3 castes

1166
01:12:33,372 --> 01:12:36,706
He won't easily part with
such a priceless statuette

1167
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:39,831
Is caste politics played to
such an extent with this statuette?

1168
01:12:40,664 --> 01:12:42,581
How did he become an MLA?

1169
01:12:42,581 --> 01:12:44,330
Only they rule the roost now

1170
01:12:44,414 --> 01:12:46,455
They even try for chief ministership

1171
01:12:46,497 --> 01:12:47,998
You have no chance

1172
01:12:49,122 --> 01:12:51,414
No chance I'll let it go either

1173
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,706
I've found it
after so many years!

1174
01:12:53,747 --> 01:12:54,872
It's mine

1175
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:58,122
-I'll somehow prove it
- Please do that

1176
01:12:58,163 --> 01:13:00,497
I can pay up the loan
and retrieve my house

1177
01:13:01,622 --> 01:13:02,914
I have an idea

1178
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:06,289
Statuette will reach his house
in another 2 days

1179
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:07,831
You go and ask him

1180
01:13:07,872 --> 01:13:09,289
He will refuse for sure

1181
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:13,455
But record what you both speak
on a button camera

1182
01:13:13,497 --> 01:13:15,539
- Button camera?
- Yes

1183
01:13:17,289 --> 01:13:18,956
This is a button camera

1184
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,163
This is a clock camera

1185
01:13:20,205 --> 01:13:21,789
- This is a 'brief' camera
- Underwear?

1186
01:13:21,872 --> 01:13:23,998
- So keep the button here
- And then?

1187
01:13:24,581 --> 01:13:27,080
I mean fix it in your shirt
and record your conversation

1188
01:13:28,205 --> 01:13:30,205
Let us go and buy that button

1189
01:13:30,247 --> 01:13:31,289
Hello, hello...!

1190
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:32,747
You won't get it in a shop

1191
01:13:32,831 --> 01:13:34,372
You must order it in the internet

1192
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:36,414
Let's go to the internet and buy it

1193
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:39,414
Internet means
Flip card or Amazingon card!

1194
01:13:39,497 --> 01:13:41,455
Come, hit the button

1195
01:13:41,497 --> 01:13:42,914
How will we get the item?

1196
01:13:42,956 --> 01:13:45,205
As if he'll deliver it
at your doorstep!

1197
01:13:45,247 --> 01:13:46,956
Of course, that's what he will do

1198
01:13:46,998 --> 01:13:49,706
Aiyayo! Then he'll know our plan

1199
01:13:49,747 --> 01:13:52,622
He won't barge into your bedroom
He'll leave it at your doorstep

1200
01:13:52,664 --> 01:13:53,789
But even then-

1201
01:13:53,831 --> 01:13:56,080
Trust me as an IT student!
Now look there

1202
01:13:56,122 --> 01:13:57,581
I'll order it

1203
01:13:58,539 --> 01:14:00,706
Will it be delivered today?

1204
01:14:00,747 --> 01:14:02,956
How will you pay for it?
Through this, huh?

1205
01:14:02,998 --> 01:14:04,122
Bank transfer...?

1206
01:14:04,163 --> 01:14:06,747
If the item doesn't work
will he take it back?

1207
01:14:06,789 --> 01:14:09,664
- What if it's a duplicate?
- Everything in Tamil Nadu is a duplicate

1208
01:14:09,706 --> 01:14:11,205
- That's all, eh?
- Done!

1209
01:14:12,747 --> 01:14:14,747
- Bro, then-
- You'll get it

1210
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:16,372
You will get it

1211
01:14:16,664 --> 01:14:18,706
Till what time at night
will he deliver?

1212
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:21,205
Will he come even on
Saturday and Sunday?

1213
01:14:22,372 --> 01:14:24,706
Then on all festivals and functions?

1214
01:14:25,622 --> 01:14:27,163
What do you think of yourself?

1215
01:14:27,205 --> 01:14:29,289
He's also a human being
like you and me!

1216
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:30,497
I didn't mean that-

1217
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:33,289
Listen, it will take more than
4 days to be delivered

1218
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:34,998
Until then, shut your gob!

1219
01:14:37,247 --> 01:14:38,581
- 4 days
- What, da?

1220
01:14:38,581 --> 01:14:40,205
Your uncle threw the rice down

1221
01:14:40,247 --> 01:14:41,956
Pick it up and eat
Kneel down!

1222
01:14:41,998 --> 01:14:43,581
'What will I do till then?'

1223
01:14:43,622 --> 01:14:45,622
Hey Mysskin
I'm bored

1224
01:14:45,664 --> 01:14:46,914
Let's play cricket

1225
01:14:48,539 --> 01:14:50,414
Hey! Come on

1226
01:15:08,372 --> 01:15:09,914
I can't come now, ma

1227
01:15:23,581 --> 01:15:27,956
"We gathered together happily
to watch 'Video & Audio' songs on TV"

1228
01:15:27,998 --> 01:15:32,455
"We've broken bonds with this bad habit
of changing channels every minute"

1229
01:15:32,497 --> 01:15:36,497
"Superstar's heroines are grandmas now"

1230
01:15:36,539 --> 01:15:40,747
"Beautiful heroines now ready to act"

1231
01:15:40,872 --> 01:15:42,330
What are you doing, da?

1232
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:44,497
You're coming up with weird ideas

1233
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:47,789
I'm creating a channel 'Comali'
on You Tube, I'm uploading everything

1234
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:49,497
'Likes' are sky rocketing!

1235
01:15:49,539 --> 01:15:50,998
Can we make more videos?

1236
01:15:51,455 --> 01:15:53,330
Please, grandma

1237
01:15:53,998 --> 01:15:55,455
Yes, rock on, guru

1238
01:16:03,622 --> 01:16:07,872
"We ate candy watches from our wrist then"

1239
01:16:07,914 --> 01:16:09,455
- What, da?
- Waiting for the order

1240
01:16:09,497 --> 01:16:12,289
"Now life goes by with sugar and BP
counted on wrist watch in a jiffy"

1241
01:16:12,372 --> 01:16:15,122
Your girlfriend is like a kite
Let it fly free in the sky

1242
01:16:15,163 --> 01:16:16,956
If any mistake is about to happen

1243
01:16:16,998 --> 01:16:18,122
...pull it towards us

1244
01:16:18,163 --> 01:16:20,414
He shouldn't fall for your girl

1245
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:22,455
You shouldn't lust after his girl

1246
01:16:22,497 --> 01:16:24,664
In case you cross boundaries

1247
01:16:24,706 --> 01:16:25,789
Downfall!

1248
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,122
Broken strings

1249
01:16:27,163 --> 01:16:29,747
Doubt is like 'manja'
the abrasive string of a kite

1250
01:16:29,789 --> 01:16:31,372
Don't ever use it

1251
01:16:31,414 --> 01:16:33,330
It will rip your love apart!

1252
01:16:33,414 --> 01:16:34,581
Content!

1253
01:16:37,914 --> 01:16:45,914
"Accept all religions as one you said
You broke that consent half way instead"

1254
01:16:46,497 --> 01:16:54,372
"You took into your political party
one who visited the temple as a devotee"

1255
01:16:54,789 --> 01:17:02,789
"Good-for-nothing louts reek of temerity
To survive in Tamil Nadu, body aches badly"

1256
01:17:03,289 --> 01:17:10,998
"Out of towners come in plenty
to hold jobs in our city"

1257
01:17:11,372 --> 01:17:12,664
'I heard just now'

1258
01:17:12,706 --> 01:17:14,581
'Alambadi cows are now extinct'

1259
01:17:14,581 --> 01:17:15,998

1260
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,998
'Even Rajapalayam dogs will disappear'

01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,956
'What the hell have you done, I say?'

1262
01:17:19,998 --> 01:17:23,747
"Where am I, buddy?
What happened to me?"

1263
01:17:23,831 --> 01:17:28,414
"Now in India whose word is law duly?"

1264
01:17:28,455 --> 01:17:29,497
'Save water!'

1265
01:17:29,581 --> 01:17:31,122
'Water should only save us, eh?'

1266
01:17:31,163 --> 01:17:32,539
'Are we saving water now?'

1267
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:34,956
'What have you done, I say?
Get lost!'

1268
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:38,664
'It all started when you began
selling water in bottles...!'

1269
01:17:38,706 --> 01:17:41,289
- When I was in coma I dreamt
- Why did you call her here?

1270
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:44,581
Phone chats don't feel the same
as face to face talk

1271
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:45,998
Look! I'm getting electrocuted!

1272
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,581
I captured your blush!

1273
01:17:51,414 --> 01:17:52,914
He has pampered everyone

1274
01:17:52,956 --> 01:17:54,831
Kids who sat quietly at home

1275
01:17:55,163 --> 01:17:57,581
Know who this is?

1276
01:17:57,789 --> 01:17:59,080
He's my son!

1277
01:17:59,247 --> 01:18:01,581
Even I recognize him
only if I look at him twice

1278
01:18:01,581 --> 01:18:02,914
I still have some doubt, sir

1279
01:18:02,956 --> 01:18:04,831
Yov! I meant he has tanned

1280
01:18:04,872 --> 01:18:06,747
Uncle, let's spin a top

1281
01:18:06,789 --> 01:18:08,622
See! What is that 'bambaram'?

1282
01:18:09,998 --> 01:18:12,330
'Uncle, let us play'

1283
01:18:13,414 --> 01:18:15,497
Let us play a game of cricket instead

1284
01:18:15,581 --> 01:18:16,831
No need cricket

1285
01:18:16,872 --> 01:18:19,122
'Spinning a top is so exciting'

1286
01:18:23,205 --> 01:18:25,205
You want to play
with a top, right?

1287
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:27,581
I care two hoots
what anyone says, come on

1288
01:18:27,581 --> 01:18:28,956
I'll complain to my father

1289
01:18:28,998 --> 01:18:31,080
I'll fix a hook into
your father's throat!

1290
01:18:33,414 --> 01:18:35,539
Hey...soooper, pa

1291
01:18:37,163 --> 01:18:41,247
"One tonsured head banged another baldie
They climbed up a drumstick tree"

1292

"A wicked black ant bit them hungrily
They wept and wailed angrily"

1293
01:18:45,497 --> 01:18:46,956
We used to bathe in a stream

1294
01:18:46,998 --> 01:18:48,122
- Yes
- Let's do that

1295
01:18:48,163 --> 01:18:49,664
We are walking on that stream!

1296
01:18:49,706 --> 01:18:50,998
Look here

1297
01:18:51,581 --> 01:18:53,205
What have you done, I say!

1298
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:57,497
"Kids in the 90s watched 'A' movie
in CDs smuggled secretly"

1299
01:18:57,539 --> 01:18:58,998
Don't do this to get 'likes'!

1300
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,455
'If husband and wife live together
it's called 'joint family' I believe'

1301
01:19:02,998 --> 01:19:05,080
"Let new roads be laid...oho"

1302
01:19:05,122 --> 01:19:07,163
"Let the nation change...ahaa!"

1303
01:19:07,205 --> 01:19:10,539
"Let the farmer prosper
with his agriculture"

1304
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:11,581
"True that!"

1305
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:13,581
"Let English be taught...yeah yeah!"

1306
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:15,664
"Speak Hindi too...kya kya?"

1307
01:19:15,706 --> 01:19:18,831
"Let our mother tongue Tamil alone
be the jewel in our crown"

1308
01:19:18,872 --> 01:19:19,956
Proud Tamilian!

1309
01:19:19,998 --> 01:19:21,414
'I ate this pizza'

1310
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:24,163
'What have you done, I say?'

1311
01:19:24,205 --> 01:19:26,289
'Combination of butter and oil'

1312
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:27,956
'Who do you love it I wonder?!'

1313
01:19:27,998 --> 01:19:29,163
'Knock knock'

1314
01:19:29,205 --> 01:19:31,122
'- Knock who?
- Ghost, dude'

1315
01:19:31,163 --> 01:19:33,414
'- What do you want, brother?
- I want a color'

1316
01:19:33,497 --> 01:19:35,497
'- What color, bro?
- Green, you know?'

1317
01:19:35,539 --> 01:19:37,581
'- Which green, da?
- Like the mango, ma'

1318
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:39,998
'- Which ma?
- Cinema!'

1319
01:19:41,706 --> 01:19:44,372
'- Which ma?
- Your amma!'

1320
01:19:44,831 --> 01:19:47,414
She doesn't like all this
You'll get it from her!

1321
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:50,289
Wow! Palmyra fruit?
Ages since I tasted it

1322
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:52,330
I climbed the tree
specially for you

1323
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:57,497
"Superstar's heroines are grandmas now"

1324

"Beautiful heroines now ready to act"

1325
01:20:02,455 --> 01:20:06,497
"So much has changed here
In 20 years, oh dear!"

1326
01:20:06,539 --> 01:20:09,080
Power outage just when we are eating

1327
01:20:09,122 --> 01:20:12,205
- Shall we have moonlight rice?
- What's that rice?

1328
01:20:12,247 --> 01:20:13,664
My mother has never made it!

1329
01:20:13,706 --> 01:20:15,872
Moonlight rice you don't know
I'll show you!

1330
01:20:15,914 --> 01:20:21,163
"What happened to me?
Now in India whose word is law truly?"

1331
01:20:21,205 --> 01:20:23,622
Why is everyone going up
to the terrace? Strange!

1332
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:31,414
"Where am I? What happened to me?
Now in India whose word is law duly?"

1333
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:33,080
'Ages since we did this'

1334
01:20:44,998 --> 01:20:46,372
'Office calling'

1335
01:20:46,914 --> 01:20:49,831
'Office calling'

1336
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,080
Hello?

1337
01:20:51,205 --> 01:20:53,914
Put this there
and put that here

1338
01:20:53,956 --> 01:20:55,497
Fix a huge lock on the office door!

1339
01:20:55,581 --> 01:20:57,080
I'm mailing you now, sir

1340
01:20:57,122 --> 01:20:59,455
It won't reach you
for sure, hang up now

1341
01:20:59,789 --> 01:21:00,914
He's bugging me!

1342
01:21:01,414 --> 01:21:03,122
You said office is closed today?

1343
01:21:03,163 --> 01:21:04,497
Work from home, da

1344
01:21:04,581 --> 01:21:07,122
I know home work
What's this 'work from home'?

1345
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:09,414
IT means you must work from home too

1346
01:21:09,789 --> 01:21:11,998
- For so long?
- He won't help with house work

1347
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:14,080
What? I ate
Hang up now

1348
01:21:14,497 --> 01:21:15,664
Who is this now?

1349
01:21:15,956 --> 01:21:17,664
My mother, da
She's at my brother's place

1350
01:21:18,247 --> 01:21:19,455
You cut the call so soon?

1351
01:21:19,497 --> 01:21:21,956
What will she ask?
Did you eat, sleep?

1352
01:21:21,998 --> 01:21:22,998
That's all...?

1353
01:21:25,998 --> 01:21:29,998
Who else in this world other than your amma
will ask if you've eaten or slept well?

1354
01:21:31,247 --> 01:21:34,455
You speak to strangers
for hours at a stretch

1355
01:21:34,497 --> 01:21:36,455
Why not to your mother, da?

1356
01:21:36,998 --> 01:21:37,998
How sad is that!

1357
01:21:41,747 --> 01:21:43,789
Hello...did you eat, ma?

1358
01:21:48,289 --> 01:21:50,706
You said it was a small button camera...!

1359
01:21:50,747 --> 01:21:52,581
You're prepping me
like a human bomb

1360
01:21:52,622 --> 01:21:53,831
Wait, he'll explain

1361
01:21:53,872 --> 01:21:54,956
Button camera

1362
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:56,831
'It will store the videos it records'

1363
01:21:56,872 --> 01:21:58,289
'This is the transmitter'

1364
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:01,289
'To transmit the recorded videos
upto a distance of 100m'

1365
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:03,080
'If there's a jammer in the house'

1366
01:22:03,122 --> 01:22:05,372
'...this device will ensure
the video gets transmitted'

1367
01:22:05,414 --> 01:22:07,455
'This is a powerful battery source'

1368
01:22:07,998 --> 01:22:09,998
Is he an electrician?

1369
01:22:10,122 --> 01:22:12,581
Can't you guess?
Looks like a bat in a temple

1370
01:22:12,581 --> 01:22:14,539
Shut up! He's my friend
Professional hacker!

1371
01:22:16,372 --> 01:22:18,414
Videos that get recorded in this...

1372
01:22:18,455 --> 01:22:21,497
...should directly go 'live' to
YouTube channel and Facebook

1373
01:22:21,581 --> 01:22:23,622
- Let my subscribers see this
- Okay, guru

1374
01:22:23,664 --> 01:22:25,998
We'll upload and
become a celebrity in 1 day

1375
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,455
Don't you go to school?

1376
01:22:27,539 --> 01:22:29,247
What do you want me to do there?

1377
01:22:30,539 --> 01:22:32,247
- Shall we go, da?
- Yes, di

1378
01:22:33,247 --> 01:22:34,581
Da...di

1379
01:22:34,622 --> 01:22:37,205
'Da' is short form for darling

1380
01:22:37,581 --> 01:22:39,372
Short form of dear is 'di'

1381
01:22:39,414 --> 01:22:40,789
Ravi told me yesterday

1382
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:42,872
Don't you have any shame, da?

1383
01:22:43,455 --> 01:22:44,581
'Make an U turn'

1384
01:22:44,998 --> 01:22:45,998
Okay

1385
01:22:49,372 --> 01:22:50,581
'Make an U turn'

1386
01:22:50,622 --> 01:22:52,414
- Okay
- You could have gone straight

1387
01:22:52,455 --> 01:22:53,956
Google Map never lies

1388
01:22:53,998 --> 01:22:55,664
'Turn left to Othapalam'

1389
01:22:55,747 --> 01:22:57,414
- O-kay
- Where are they roaming?

1390
01:22:57,455 --> 01:22:59,372
Google Map never lies! Right

1391
01:22:59,414 --> 01:23:01,414
- 'Take the exit on right'
- Okay

1392
01:23:01,622 --> 01:23:03,914
Getting into that alley?
Look how I catch you!

1393
01:23:05,497 --> 01:23:07,122
- Turn right
- Okay

1394
01:23:07,163 --> 01:23:08,581
- Get up, man
- He's bathing!

1395
01:23:09,205 --> 01:23:10,581
'Turn left'

1396
01:23:10,622 --> 01:23:11,706
Okay!

1397
01:23:12,205 --> 01:23:13,706
- What?!
- 'Please eat'

1398
01:23:13,747 --> 01:23:15,330
Sis, spicy dried fish curry?

1399
01:23:15,831 --> 01:23:16,872
'Who is this?'

1400
01:23:16,956 --> 01:23:17,956
'Junk of a jerk!'

1401
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:20,581
- Will you barge in like that?
- Google Map never lies, aunty!

1402
01:23:20,872 --> 01:23:23,455
- 'You have arrived at your destination'
- Okay

1403
01:23:25,414 --> 01:23:26,581
R.I.P area

1404
01:23:26,998 --> 01:23:28,581
My God...!

1405
01:23:29,706 --> 01:23:32,372
- Wait
- Google Map won't lie?!

1406
01:23:32,414 --> 01:23:36,330
It is usually right, I don't know
why Google showed us this area!

1407
01:23:36,372 --> 01:23:38,497
'Net pack is over
No wonder it chose this place!'

1408
01:23:38,539 --> 01:23:40,080
- Boss?
- What, chief?

1409
01:23:40,122 --> 01:23:41,581
How do we go to Brindavan Nagar?

1410
01:23:41,581 --> 01:23:42,872
- Which street?
- 2nd street

1411
01:23:42,914 --> 01:23:44,539
Why did you come here then?

1412
01:23:44,581 --> 01:23:47,372
Go straight
Last right, last left

1413
01:23:47,414 --> 01:23:49,872
You'll see a temple and
then a mud road, take that route

1414
01:23:49,998 --> 01:23:50,998
Thanks, boss

1415
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,414
Auto driver is the best map
for routes always

1416
01:23:53,497 --> 01:23:56,455
[song from 'Baashaa']

1417
01:23:56,497 --> 01:23:59,956
"Auto driver knows address wherever
even without street name or number"

1418
01:24:00,998 --> 01:24:02,122
Switch it on

1419
01:24:08,122 --> 01:24:09,247
Live!

1420
01:24:15,122 --> 01:24:17,122
- Hey, that's the watchman
- Bro...?

1421
01:24:19,831 --> 01:24:22,372
- We want to see Dharmaraj sir
- Why are you asking me?

1422
01:24:22,414 --> 01:24:23,789
Go and ask Dharmaraj

1423
01:24:23,831 --> 01:24:24,998
He must be mad

1424
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,831
We want to know how to meet him

1425
01:24:26,872 --> 01:24:29,831
Press the video calling bell
Someone will attend to you

1426
01:24:29,872 --> 01:24:32,455
It's 4'o clock
I'll go drink my cup of tea

1427
01:24:32,664 --> 01:24:34,831
Why inform us about his tea routine?

1428
01:24:34,872 --> 01:24:37,581
Maybe he has no one to talk to
Poor fellow!

1429
01:24:41,205 --> 01:24:42,872
Seems like an army is here!

1430
01:24:42,998 --> 01:24:44,622
If we get caught, harakiri

1431
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:46,080
Total genocide!

1432
01:24:54,455 --> 01:24:57,205
You seem vaguely familiar

1433
01:24:57,289 --> 01:25:01,080
When you came here we were there
You must have seen us then, sir

1434
01:25:01,831 --> 01:25:03,330
No chance at all, bro

1435
01:25:09,122 --> 01:25:10,581
Get my charger, da

1436
01:25:12,289 --> 01:25:16,497
I will prove to the world
the statuette Dharmaraj has is mine

1437
01:25:16,581 --> 01:25:18,664
He's going with camera to MLA's place

1438
01:25:18,872 --> 01:25:21,080
'Hello, I'm Ravi here'

1439
01:25:24,789 --> 01:25:26,998
16 years in coma

1440
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:29,664
'Poor chap!'

1441
01:25:29,706 --> 01:25:33,289
'I don't know whether to laugh
or feel sorry for you'

1442
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:35,080
- Which channel?
- 'Comali'

1443
01:25:35,122 --> 01:25:37,831
- 'Did you wake up to torture me?'
- Must be MLA's house

1444
01:25:37,872 --> 01:25:38,872
Let's go

1445
01:25:39,872 --> 01:25:41,789
'Aiyo! So sad'

1446
01:25:42,247 --> 01:25:45,330
I agree, that statuette is...

1447
01:25:45,455 --> 01:25:46,747
...not mine

1448
01:25:46,998 --> 01:25:48,664
'Only you know that'

1449
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,914
But as far as this city is concerned...

1450
01:25:50,956 --> 01:25:52,497
...it is mine

1451
01:25:52,539 --> 01:25:55,789
To claim that statuette is yours

1452
01:25:55,872 --> 01:25:58,455
...what proof do you have?

1453
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,581
You know very well

1454
01:26:00,581 --> 01:26:01,831
...that statue-

1455
01:26:01,872 --> 01:26:04,247
'Hey! Why are you jerking around?'

1456
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:05,330
What happened?

1457
01:26:05,372 --> 01:26:06,956
Short circuit because he's sweating

1458
01:26:06,998 --> 01:26:08,455
We are done for!

1459
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:09,539
Tell me

1460
01:26:10,289 --> 01:26:14,289
What proof do you have?

1461
01:26:14,998 --> 01:26:17,956
Now look here and tell me

1462
01:26:18,581 --> 01:26:19,831
'Go on'

1463
01:26:21,205 --> 01:26:24,289
He's churning his knife
like 'dhal' down my throat!

1464
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:25,706
Please blurt it out

1465
01:26:27,622 --> 01:26:30,080
Sir...you know very well

1466
01:26:30,122 --> 01:26:31,998
You took it from me and-

1467
01:26:34,205 --> 01:26:36,539
- Why are you prancing around?
- Why, da?

1468
01:26:36,581 --> 01:26:37,747
Chi! Get up

1469
01:26:38,122 --> 01:26:39,205
Chi! You also get up

1470
01:26:39,247 --> 01:26:41,289
I'll close my eyes, you get up

1471
01:26:42,622 --> 01:26:43,998
Now look here

1472
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:48,539
I don't care what proof you have

1473
01:26:48,872 --> 01:26:49,914
Do you know why?

1474
01:26:49,956 --> 01:26:53,163
Those who derided me
as an illegitimate kid

1475
01:26:53,247 --> 01:26:56,289
All those who tore my dignity to shreds

1476
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:58,247
When they knew I have a royal lineage

1477
01:26:58,289 --> 01:27:01,080
Please take your tablet, Your Majesty!

1478
01:27:02,747 --> 01:27:04,831
They want to make me a minister

1479
01:27:04,872 --> 01:27:08,163
You are a rascal
with none of these privileges

1480
01:27:08,205 --> 01:27:10,581
Do you think I'll part
with that priceless statuette?

1481
01:27:10,622 --> 01:27:11,956
It belongs to me

1482
01:27:11,998 --> 01:27:13,789
Wave whatever magic wand you have!

1483
01:27:13,831 --> 01:27:15,372
Goddess...help me!

1484
01:27:15,581 --> 01:27:19,414
Looks like he will get possessed here
Beat him to a pulp and chase him

1485
01:27:19,872 --> 01:27:21,372
Thank God!

1486
01:27:24,622 --> 01:27:26,497
- Get lost!
- Wait, bro

1487
01:27:26,581 --> 01:27:30,330
- I'll make them run with this video!
- How?

1488
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:37,581
- Go see what he is upto
- Okay, bro

1489
01:27:38,134 --> 01:27:39,551
[humming a song]

1490
01:27:39,593 --> 01:27:41,010
Hey! What is that?

1491
01:27:41,052 --> 01:27:42,926
- Don't
- What do you mean by that?

1492
01:27:42,968 --> 01:27:44,760
You'll get electrocuted
if you touch me

1493
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:47,468
Think you're actor Vijaykanth or what!

1494
01:27:48,468 --> 01:27:51,593
He is creating a scene
as if he has seizures

1495
01:27:51,676 --> 01:27:53,010
One swift blow-

1496
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:59,676
He's streaming everything 'live', nab him

1497
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,843
What is he saying?

1498
01:28:00,885 --> 01:28:02,301
'Don't pull me
Wait, I'll oblige'

1499
01:28:04,477 --> 01:28:06,227
They found out our plan, you leave

1500
01:28:06,269 --> 01:28:08,269
Someone else is outside
Go, get them

1501
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:09,727
He got us in trouble too!

1502
01:28:09,769 --> 01:28:11,227
- Get the key
- I don't have it

1503
01:28:11,269 --> 01:28:13,519
- Who has it then?
- Car key is with me

1504
01:28:13,561 --> 01:28:15,269
You dunderhead!

1505
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:17,602
"Am I the joker?"

1506
01:28:17,644 --> 01:28:22,227
"You are the court jester
who will end up as the sucker"

1507
01:28:22,269 --> 01:28:23,519
"Who is the prankster?"

1508
01:28:23,561 --> 01:28:24,561
What is 'live'?

1509
01:28:24,602 --> 01:28:26,644
He is uploading the events here online

1510
01:28:26,686 --> 01:28:28,894
- Let him, so what?
- Whole world will know!

1511
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:30,477
Did I hear you right?

1512
01:28:30,519 --> 01:28:31,894
Goodness gracious!!

1513
01:28:32,477 --> 01:28:33,602
"Clown, funster"

1514
01:28:34,686 --> 01:28:35,978
"Joker of the year"

1515
01:28:36,936 --> 01:28:38,852
"Prankster, punster dear"

1516
01:28:39,435 --> 01:28:40,769
"Joker, buffoon"

1517
01:28:41,561 --> 01:28:42,894
"Jokester, clown"

1518
01:28:43,811 --> 01:28:44,978
What is he doing?

1519
01:28:46,185 --> 01:28:47,394
"Quipster"

1520
01:28:48,185 --> 01:28:49,561
"Wisecracker"

1521
01:28:57,644 --> 01:29:03,644
"For 16 years a comatose patient in bed
Get into the arena, doomsday ahead"

1522
01:29:03,686 --> 01:29:05,561
Don't hit me
I can't bear the pain

1523
01:29:06,561 --> 01:29:11,561
"Comatose patient, one and only
Gagster of the year, Coma-li!"

1524
01:29:11,602 --> 01:29:12,769
Oh gawd!

1525
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:14,602
I'll hurl it right this time

1526
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:17,561
You don't have to save me at all

1527
01:29:29,561 --> 01:29:31,644
Can we know what is happening here, sir?

1528
01:29:31,686 --> 01:29:34,352
Do you already know Ravi
who streamed events 'live'?

1529
01:29:34,394 --> 01:29:35,519
That is a matter of-

1530
01:29:35,561 --> 01:29:36,936
Handing them over to the cops?

1531
01:29:36,978 --> 01:29:38,561
Then he has to count bars too!

1532
01:29:38,602 --> 01:29:40,602
When signal got cut,
were you attacked?

1533
01:29:40,644 --> 01:29:42,811
'What...when was I attacked?'

1534
01:29:42,852 --> 01:29:44,852
When signal got cut,
were you attacked?

1535
01:29:44,894 --> 01:29:45,894
What are you ask-

1536
01:29:45,936 --> 01:29:47,769
How will you tackle these allegations?

1537
01:29:47,811 --> 01:29:49,352
'Bro, look at this'

1538
01:29:49,894 --> 01:29:53,102
'I agree, that statuette is mine'

1539
01:29:55,894 --> 01:29:59,310
'I agree, that statuette is mine'

1540
01:30:00,852 --> 01:30:01,894
'Got cut'

1541
01:30:02,102 --> 01:30:04,352
Short circuit
because he's sweating

1542
01:30:05,269 --> 01:30:06,936
Complete your comment, sir

1543
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:09,060
- What will you do, sir?
- Wait...wait

1544
01:30:09,227 --> 01:30:10,936
- What is your reply?
- What will I do?

1545
01:30:11,561 --> 01:30:13,227
I'll forgive them
and let them go

1546
01:30:14,143 --> 01:30:17,310
They wanted to be
the talk of the town

1547
01:30:17,352 --> 01:30:20,435
They stoop to do all this
to grab 2 minutes of limelight

1548
01:30:20,477 --> 01:30:23,894
Poor fellow!
He is mentally affected

1549
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:27,561
'He was lying in coma for many years
and just regained consciousness'

1550
01:30:27,852 --> 01:30:31,852
Out of goodness of my heart
I'll help him to the best of my ability

1551
01:30:32,143 --> 01:30:33,811
I always stick to this tagline

1552
01:30:33,978 --> 01:30:35,561
There can be only 1 original

1553
01:30:35,602 --> 01:30:36,769
That is...!

1554
01:30:37,435 --> 01:30:38,978
Only he will say so!

1555
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:43,143
I'll do whatever I can
for you as well...huh?

1556
01:30:43,269 --> 01:30:44,519
God bless you

1557
01:30:49,852 --> 01:30:52,394
'I became very popular online'

1558
01:30:52,435 --> 01:30:53,936
'Minimum % for good issues'

1559
01:30:53,978 --> 01:30:55,894
'Maximum % for the flip side'

1560
01:30:55,936 --> 01:30:58,602
'Nowadays people lap up negativity'

1561
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:00,686
'I became the troll king!'

1562
01:31:02,686 --> 01:31:05,310
'I am not to be blamed'

1563
01:31:06,102 --> 01:31:07,561
'I forgot to connect the battery'

1564
01:31:08,561 --> 01:31:09,769
Aiyo!

1565
01:31:09,936 --> 01:31:12,185
Ravi, you are being trolled,
trampled and crucified!

1566
01:31:12,269 --> 01:31:15,227
At least change your dress
Looks like you had a dressing down!

1567
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:16,269
I won't!

1568
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:17,644
At least that button-

1569
01:31:19,978 --> 01:31:21,978
Madam, I am from ICIS bank

1570
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,394
- Tell me
- Is sir not at home?

1571
01:31:23,435 --> 01:31:24,811
- He is there
- Good

1572
01:31:24,852 --> 01:31:28,269
Do I look like a nincompoop?
You are not picking my call?

1573
01:31:28,686 --> 01:31:30,352
Sir, don't be offensive

1574
01:31:30,394 --> 01:31:32,435
Not paying your dues is defensive?

1575
01:31:32,477 --> 01:31:34,727
But if I'm offensive
I'll tell you with due respect!

1576
01:31:34,936 --> 01:31:38,686
In another 30 days
if you don't pay minimum 3 million

1577
01:31:38,727 --> 01:31:40,435
...we will rip you apart!

1578
01:31:40,477 --> 01:31:42,936
Don't think we'll pluck
our locks of hair in frustration

1579
01:31:42,978 --> 01:31:44,727
We will punch your face
with our left hand

1580
01:31:45,936 --> 01:31:47,352
Son of a gun!

1581
01:31:47,519 --> 01:31:50,060
Is it necessary for you to be
on the wrong side of law, sonny?

1582
01:31:50,143 --> 01:31:53,519
So Mr Shameless, junk of a jerk,
armpit rumple stink skin

1583
01:31:53,561 --> 01:31:55,727
5h17 face, disgusting piece of deer poop

1584
01:31:55,769 --> 01:31:58,894
Lousy lavatory, poo loo,
king of nastiness, muck of yuckiness

1585
01:31:58,936 --> 01:32:01,561
Brother of shame, undies itch,
sore galore and more

1586
01:32:01,602 --> 01:32:04,352
Nose digger, pustule pimple,
scheming seepage

1587
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:07,811
Even a street dog will be faithful lifelong
if fed with biscuits just worth Rs 5

1588
01:32:07,894 --> 01:32:11,185
With your 6th sense, don't you shudder
in shame when you sleep at night?

1589
01:32:14,978 --> 01:32:17,060
You hit us if we ask
for our rightful dues?

1590
01:32:17,143 --> 01:32:19,769
Not 1 month, in 1 week
your house will be seized!

1591
01:32:19,811 --> 01:32:22,894
- I'll repay your money in just 1 week
- Oh yes, royal lineage!

1592
01:32:22,936 --> 01:32:24,561
Like it or not, yes I am!

1593
01:32:24,602 --> 01:32:26,269
Why did you hit him now?

1594
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,936
Heard his string of cuss words?

1595
01:32:27,978 --> 01:32:29,394
It's casual, no big deal

1596
01:32:29,519 --> 01:32:31,352
I'll show you
Hey! You ******!

1597
01:32:32,269 --> 01:32:33,394
Hi, bro

1598
01:32:33,435 --> 01:32:35,602
- Shut your gob, scumbag!
- Hi friends

1599
01:32:35,811 --> 01:32:37,769
Saw how he reacted so casually?

1600
01:32:39,894 --> 01:32:41,978
Is this your father's house?
My father gave it to me

1601
01:32:43,978 --> 01:32:46,310
'Sir, this is a smuggled piece of antique'

1602
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:48,686
'It is being reported
you head the mafia'

1603
01:32:48,727 --> 01:32:50,477
'What is your opinion?'

1604
01:32:50,727 --> 01:32:53,978
'1000s of people malign you in our city'

1605
01:32:54,143 --> 01:32:56,978
'If you let them affect you
can you review films?'

1606
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:00,519
'I am asking you in ignorance
just to prove my innocence to the people'

1607
01:33:00,561 --> 01:33:03,811
'...can I take a snap shot
every year holding that statuette?'

1608
01:33:03,852 --> 01:33:05,727
'From when I was a toddler'

1609
01:33:05,769 --> 01:33:08,477
'Can I take a snap shot
every year holding that-'

1610
01:33:10,852 --> 01:33:12,978
[echoing words]

1611
01:33:13,185 --> 01:33:15,102
'From when I was a toddler'

1612
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:36,352
Eureka!! I got it
I finally found it

1613
01:33:36,394 --> 01:33:37,435
Got what?

1614
01:33:37,519 --> 01:33:40,185
Nikitha clicked a photo of us
in that exhibition, right?

1615
01:33:40,269 --> 01:33:43,352
- Yes
- That's our proof of ownership

1616
01:33:43,561 --> 01:33:45,936
Hit the nail on that head!

1617
01:33:45,978 --> 01:33:47,102
Let's go, right now

1618
01:33:47,978 --> 01:33:49,060
What is it?

1619
01:33:49,102 --> 01:33:51,394
When Nikitha clicked that photo

1620
01:33:51,435 --> 01:33:54,727
...Suresh walked up and down
hiding the statuette you were holding

1621
01:33:54,769 --> 01:33:56,894
Was he sitting or standing?

1622
01:33:56,936 --> 01:33:57,936
Hey!

1623
01:33:59,143 --> 01:34:01,185
Don't worry, I'll call him
I have his number

1624
01:34:03,519 --> 01:34:04,978
- Hello...?
- Hello, machi

1625
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:06,269
16 years ago

1626
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:08,978
'Remember we clicked a photo
in our high school exhibition?'

1627
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,686
Were you sitting or standing then?

1628
01:34:10,727 --> 01:34:13,143
- We had exhibitions, huh?
- 'Yes, you fat buffalo!'

1629
01:34:13,185 --> 01:34:14,435
You got any photo
send it to me

1630
01:34:14,477 --> 01:34:16,477
He wants me to send the photo?!

1631
01:34:16,519 --> 01:34:18,477
Were you sitting or standing?

1632
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:19,769
Tell me now
Very important

1633
01:34:21,978 --> 01:34:23,394
Think I was sitting

1634
01:34:23,477 --> 01:34:25,727
- He was sitting, let's go
- Super

1635
01:34:28,894 --> 01:34:32,602
'If I ever step near your door step
you can spit on my face!'

1636
01:34:33,852 --> 01:34:34,852
Yuck!

1637
01:34:35,852 --> 01:34:36,978
Why did he spit?

1638
01:34:37,102 --> 01:34:39,561
- Doctor's way of saying hello
- His habit!

1639
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:42,352
Come in

1640
01:34:42,477 --> 01:34:43,519
'Aiyo!'

1641
01:34:47,519 --> 01:34:48,602
Hello!

1642
01:34:48,644 --> 01:34:49,686
Look here

1643
01:34:52,769 --> 01:34:54,060
Tell me

1644
01:34:54,561 --> 01:34:57,143
- When we were in school
- I said look at me, right?

1645
01:34:57,185 --> 01:34:58,310
Look at me and speak

1646
01:34:58,352 --> 01:34:59,978
- You heard me?
- No...no, sir

1647
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,477
You won't know the answer

1648
01:35:01,519 --> 01:35:04,811
It's a matter between
your wife and me 16 years ago

1649
01:35:04,852 --> 01:35:07,185
- What are you saying?
- Baby, will you keep quiet?

1650
01:35:07,227 --> 01:35:08,936
I thought I was your 1st girlfriend

1651
01:35:08,978 --> 01:35:10,644
He's explaining
Kid is curious, no?

1652
01:35:10,686 --> 01:35:12,394
We will also learn about it

1653
01:35:12,435 --> 01:35:14,310
- Chi! Shut up
- Why?

1654
01:35:14,352 --> 01:35:16,185
- What 'matter'?
- That is

1655
01:35:16,227 --> 01:35:17,936
What is it about? Tell me

1656
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:20,978
When I proposed to you,
I gave you a statuette, remember?

1657
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:23,269
Its value has skyrocketed to millions

1658
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:24,602
Hey baby...baby!

1659
01:35:25,561 --> 01:35:27,102
But it is not with me now

1660
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:28,894
It is with Dharmaraj

1661
01:35:31,519 --> 01:35:33,686
All that matters is
if you give me that photo

1662
01:35:33,727 --> 01:35:37,602
I didn't even develop that negative
because I didn't want to remember you

1663
01:35:37,686 --> 01:35:39,852
She is my wife...my wife, you know

1664
01:35:39,894 --> 01:35:41,936
But I have those negatives safe

1665
01:35:41,978 --> 01:35:43,852
She is my girlfriend, you see

1666
01:35:43,894 --> 01:35:46,602
- Lover, huh?
- I was her ex lover!

1667
01:35:46,727 --> 01:35:48,561
Only ex, huh?!

1668
01:35:48,686 --> 01:35:50,310
We'll discuss that later!

1669
01:35:52,644 --> 01:35:54,352
Why are you fighting for that girl?

1670
01:35:54,394 --> 01:35:56,352
Let's look for the negative
Right, Nagaraj?

1671
01:35:56,727 --> 01:35:58,602
He has given permission, stand up

1672
01:36:01,269 --> 01:36:02,769
You look in the attic

1673
01:36:02,852 --> 01:36:04,435
- You look there, da
- Da?!

1674
01:36:04,519 --> 01:36:06,727
Yes, short form of darling is 'da'!

1675
01:36:06,769 --> 01:36:08,561
Short form of dear is 'di'!

1676
01:36:08,602 --> 01:36:10,519
Ravi taught me this acronym in school

1677
01:36:10,561 --> 01:36:12,978
I might have said it
At least I am consistent!

1678
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:14,686
'You search over there'

1679
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:15,978
'4 eyed bozo!'

1680
01:36:18,185 --> 01:36:19,394
I landed!

1681
01:36:19,435 --> 01:36:20,894
Not here, pappumma

1682
01:36:21,269 --> 01:36:23,852
- Pappumma?
- My pet name for her in school

1683
01:36:26,269 --> 01:36:27,561
Chocolate wrapper

1684
01:36:28,602 --> 01:36:31,852
Don't throw so callously
My college lover gave these

1685
01:36:31,894 --> 01:36:33,477
What...college lover?

1686
01:36:33,561 --> 01:36:36,394
I should react to that
Why are you getting tense?

1687
01:36:36,435 --> 01:36:38,936
Rat snake, I'll smash and
stuff you into that drawer!

1688
01:36:38,978 --> 01:36:41,269
Either search or sleep in your snake pit!

1689
01:36:41,894 --> 01:36:44,185
- Is this your office lover?
- Yes

1690
01:36:45,143 --> 01:36:48,185
Ma, what is this uncle's name?

1691
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:50,352
You go search that side

1692
01:36:51,143 --> 01:36:54,060
By the way, why have you
developed his photo alone?

1693
01:36:54,102 --> 01:36:55,352
I didn't love him truly

1694
01:36:55,394 --> 01:36:57,185
He doesn't make my heart race!

1695
01:36:57,269 --> 01:36:58,602
Means you loved me truly?

1696
01:36:58,644 --> 01:36:59,686
I didn't love you at all

1697
01:36:59,727 --> 01:37:01,644
I didn't develop the photo
Go and search

1698
01:37:01,686 --> 01:37:03,185
Yes, I am the winner!

1699
01:37:03,269 --> 01:37:04,769
Where is it?

1700
01:37:05,894 --> 01:37:10,310
"Drizzle of love, sizzling love
Where did you fall from above?"

1701
01:37:10,352 --> 01:37:13,561
- Hey! Don't touch that
- All the more reason I will

1702
01:37:14,644 --> 01:37:15,978
Randy fellow!

1703
01:37:16,477 --> 01:37:18,394
'Call center Kokila'

1704
01:37:18,978 --> 01:37:20,769
'ABC of all you want to know'

1705
01:37:20,894 --> 01:37:22,435
'Yes, dear, not here'

1706
01:37:22,519 --> 01:37:24,102
'Shall we have a blast?'

1707
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:25,561
Doctor!

1708
01:37:27,727 --> 01:37:29,185
Come down

1709
01:37:29,227 --> 01:37:31,435
Come down, man
You'll get it from me

1710
01:37:31,769 --> 01:37:33,894
He tore my family life to tatters!

1711
01:37:33,936 --> 01:37:37,561
Where is that negative?
Negative...negative...!

1712
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:40,769
Pappumma, move this side

1713
01:37:42,561 --> 01:37:43,852
Come this side

1714
01:37:45,435 --> 01:37:46,769
Quick...quick

1715
01:37:52,394 --> 01:37:55,727
He has lifted her!
Quick...double quick

1716
01:38:01,143 --> 01:38:02,727
What a bloody mess?!

1717
01:38:02,769 --> 01:38:04,352
Shall we go there?

1718
01:38:04,394 --> 01:38:07,435
Brother, if you go straight,
bedroom is to your left

1719
01:38:07,477 --> 01:38:09,185
- Slightly comfortable
- Super!

1720
01:38:09,269 --> 01:38:11,561
Please stop touching and
start searching, brother

1721
01:38:11,602 --> 01:38:12,936
Go inside

1722
01:38:12,978 --> 01:38:14,185
Pappumma...!

1723
01:38:14,227 --> 01:38:15,811
He and his pat my lap!

1724
01:38:26,269 --> 01:38:28,978
Make it fast...quick quick quickly!

1725
01:38:36,102 --> 01:38:37,852
Yaaaaaaay!
I FOUND IT!

1726
01:38:41,519 --> 01:38:42,894
NOOOO!

1727
01:38:54,561 --> 01:38:55,978
Dhokra is all yours!

1728
01:39:12,978 --> 01:39:14,852
Hey! Crazy coot of a doctor!

1729
01:39:14,894 --> 01:39:17,561
If you expose the film to light,
won't it be destroyed?

1730
01:39:17,602 --> 01:39:20,102
If you put it in, will it develop?
Chi! Take it out

1731
01:39:20,143 --> 01:39:21,602
Son of 'Haste makes waste'!

1732
01:39:21,644 --> 01:39:22,769
Sorry, boss

1733
01:39:22,936 --> 01:39:24,769
I use only digital camera

1734
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:42,060
'If I claim ownership of
that dhokra statuette, people will'

1735
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:43,894
...call you a 'clown'!

1736
01:39:44,269 --> 01:39:45,644
'On the 20th of this month...'

1737
01:39:45,686 --> 01:39:49,686
'...I'll donate that statuette to
our Govt with no strings attached'

1738
01:39:50,519 --> 01:39:52,227
'In 1 week your house will be seized!'

1739
01:39:52,269 --> 01:39:54,519
'In case we come to the streets'

1740
01:39:54,561 --> 01:39:56,352
'...no one is responsible for it'

1741
01:39:56,394 --> 01:39:57,686
'Only you!'

1742
01:39:59,978 --> 01:40:01,561
'It belongs to me'

1743
01:40:01,602 --> 01:40:05,102
'Wave whatever magic wand you have!'

1744
01:40:05,644 --> 01:40:06,686
Carry me

1745
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:08,352
Lift me up

1746
01:40:08,686 --> 01:40:10,227
Lift me

1747
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:11,310
Lift, ma

1748
01:40:15,978 --> 01:40:17,269
Will lift

1749
01:40:17,561 --> 01:40:18,561
We'll lift

1750
01:40:20,102 --> 01:40:21,686
We'll flick that statuette

1751
01:40:22,686 --> 01:40:23,852
No other go

1752
01:40:23,894 --> 01:40:26,644
The whole world knows
Dharma has it in his possession

1753
01:40:26,686 --> 01:40:29,060
If you take it, won't you be
branded a thief?

1754
01:40:29,644 --> 01:40:31,394
Govt has not tested it as yet

1755
01:40:32,394 --> 01:40:35,185
Only after 5 days it will be
sent to the archaeology department

1756
01:40:35,269 --> 01:40:38,394
Let's replace it with a duplicate
and flick the original

1757
01:40:38,435 --> 01:40:40,394
We can sell it illegally outside

1758
01:40:40,644 --> 01:40:41,936
We can do it, right?

1759
01:40:43,185 --> 01:40:44,561
If you age-test it

1760
01:40:44,602 --> 01:40:47,310
....original can be discerned
from the duplicate

1761
01:40:47,686 --> 01:40:49,477
Can be done
It's possible

1762
01:40:49,686 --> 01:40:50,936
1 minute

1763
01:40:51,978 --> 01:40:53,143
You intend stealing?

1764
01:40:53,185 --> 01:40:54,894
Not 'you' intend stealing?

1765
01:40:54,936 --> 01:40:56,477
'We' will steal!

1766
01:40:56,519 --> 01:40:58,143
Why should I join hands with you?

1767
01:40:58,185 --> 01:41:00,352
You searched with us, no?
Now steal with us!

1768
01:41:00,394 --> 01:41:02,978
- That's no logic at all
- No logic but what to do?

1769
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:04,519
Shall I be logical?

1770
01:41:04,561 --> 01:41:06,727
If I say your wife is my girl
don't you get mad, huh?

1771
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:07,894
Similarly

1772
01:41:07,936 --> 01:41:10,435
Retrieving my property
is stealing or not?

1773
01:41:12,894 --> 01:41:14,561
But to me it is stealing

1774
01:41:14,561 --> 01:41:16,727
Yuck! Are you such a lowlife?

1775
01:41:16,769 --> 01:41:19,686
You destroyed his life
and speaking like this?

1776
01:41:19,727 --> 01:41:20,978
I'm sorry, Ravi

1777
01:41:23,394 --> 01:41:25,644
You destroyed your own patient's life

1778
01:41:25,686 --> 01:41:27,602
Take an empty shot and die!

1779
01:41:28,852 --> 01:41:30,602
Call yourself a doctor? Chee!

1780
01:41:32,686 --> 01:41:34,894
Dad, uncle is only correct

1781
01:41:34,936 --> 01:41:36,852
Okay...okay...!

1782
01:41:37,978 --> 01:41:40,936
Okay, I'll do whatever help I can

1783
01:41:40,978 --> 01:41:43,227
But don't say I destroyed someone's life

1784
01:41:43,644 --> 01:41:44,936
Fine, I'll help you

1785
01:41:44,978 --> 01:41:48,769
'It has started to rain in Chennai
Showers may last for a week'

1786
01:41:48,894 --> 01:41:50,352
1st we should...

1787
01:41:50,394 --> 01:41:52,686
...try to see how to take it from him

1788
01:41:53,978 --> 01:41:55,227
'Office calling'

1789
01:41:57,435 --> 01:41:58,769
'Office calling'

1790
01:41:59,269 --> 01:42:01,227
We should know when he is at home

1791
01:42:01,269 --> 01:42:03,477
And when he will step out

1792
01:42:03,519 --> 01:42:04,978
Superb idea, machan

1793
01:42:07,936 --> 01:42:11,644
Okay, in order to track the beasts
and their movements in the forest...

1794
01:42:11,686 --> 01:42:13,894
...like how surveillance cameras are fixed

1795
01:42:13,936 --> 01:42:15,727
Hey! All that won't work

1796
01:42:15,769 --> 01:42:17,102
I'm talking
Don't interrupt

1797
01:42:17,602 --> 01:42:20,185
If we keep a similar camera
in front of his house-

1798
01:42:20,227 --> 01:42:21,561
Listen, it won't work!

1799
01:42:21,602 --> 01:42:24,227
Hey! Zip your lips
You don't know anything

1800
01:42:24,894 --> 01:42:26,269
After we fix the cameras-

1801
01:42:26,394 --> 01:42:28,769
What is it I don't know?
Tell me

1802
01:42:29,644 --> 01:42:33,394
I wanted to learn whatever I missed
when I had slipped into coma

1803
01:42:33,477 --> 01:42:35,602
With your help
I learnt everything

1804
01:42:35,727 --> 01:42:37,060
What's up with all of you?

1805
01:42:37,102 --> 01:42:39,894
Obsessing about camera, Facebook, message

1806
01:42:40,727 --> 01:42:44,644
With technology you think you are
getting closer but actually moving away

1807
01:42:45,519 --> 01:42:47,936
No one is talking
face to face directly

1808
01:42:49,185 --> 01:42:51,561
You said it is a decade
since you saw your classmate

1809
01:42:51,602 --> 01:42:54,352
When I asked you his address
you said some darn park!

1810
01:42:54,394 --> 01:42:55,894
When we were in school...

1811
01:42:55,936 --> 01:42:58,769
...if cricket was at 7:00 a.m
won't we assemble on the dot?

1812
01:42:58,811 --> 01:43:01,185
- We'll be there at 6:30!
- Bingo but now?

1813
01:43:01,310 --> 01:43:03,561
'Reached, where are you?
Cancelled, huh?'

1814
01:43:03,561 --> 01:43:05,143
You chat only on WhatsApp

1815
01:43:05,185 --> 01:43:07,394
No one is on the ground there

1816
01:43:07,644 --> 01:43:09,894
Hacker, how many friends on Facebook?

1817
01:43:09,936 --> 01:43:10,936
'4000'

1818
01:43:10,978 --> 01:43:12,644
Ask them for a simple favor

1819
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:14,561
Not a single soul will come to your aid

1820
01:43:14,602 --> 01:43:18,394
You will wish 'Happy birthday, ma'
to a mother who is not on Facebook!

1821
01:43:18,561 --> 01:43:20,519
How will she know you wished her?

1822
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:22,894
Then for whom are you doing all this?

1823
01:43:22,936 --> 01:43:24,769
Some random girl
you don't even know

1824
01:43:24,852 --> 01:43:27,352
You'll chat with her
for hours on Facebook

1825
01:43:27,394 --> 01:43:28,894
But to meet her in person

1826
01:43:28,936 --> 01:43:30,686
You don't have the guts, why?

1827
01:43:30,727 --> 01:43:32,394
Because that is reality

1828
01:43:33,561 --> 01:43:36,686
All of you have started
being scared of reality

1829
01:43:37,143 --> 01:43:39,269
Genuine friends
Pure happiness

1830
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:41,143
Real comfort
True birthday wish

1831
01:43:41,185 --> 01:43:43,561
You have no idea
what all these really mean

1832
01:43:44,561 --> 01:43:47,394
Sir, tell me your wife's phone #

1833
01:43:47,477 --> 01:43:49,060
Without checking your mobile

1834
01:43:49,102 --> 01:43:51,102
Can you tell me from memory, sir?

1835
01:43:51,394 --> 01:43:53,352
16 years ago
her landline #

1836
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:54,769
I remember it even now

1837
01:43:54,894 --> 01:43:56,727
22582999

1838
01:43:56,978 --> 01:43:57,936
Why?

1839
01:43:57,978 --> 01:43:59,602
Because it is embedded here

1840
01:43:59,644 --> 01:44:01,602
For all of you it is here

1841
01:44:01,936 --> 01:44:04,727
Trying to make humans into
machines and vice versa

1842
01:44:04,769 --> 01:44:06,686
I don't understand why

1843
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:08,477
Bro-in-law

1844
01:44:08,561 --> 01:44:10,435
You were worried
your son doesn't talk

1845
01:44:10,477 --> 01:44:12,477
How will he talk?
Why will he talk?

1846
01:44:12,727 --> 01:44:14,602
He doesn't have anyone to talk to

1847
01:44:14,894 --> 01:44:16,394
I spoke to him

1848
01:44:18,269 --> 01:44:19,561
But one thing is for sure

1849
01:44:20,143 --> 01:44:21,561
All these years

1850
01:44:22,352 --> 01:44:24,143
I was not the one lying in coma

1851
01:44:25,519 --> 01:44:27,561
All of you slipped into coma!

1852
01:44:28,394 --> 01:44:30,102
Please wake up now

1853
01:44:32,143 --> 01:44:34,310
I'm saying it only because
I've understood all this

1854
01:44:34,352 --> 01:44:36,519
We can't attack him
with this technology

1855
01:44:37,561 --> 01:44:40,894
If you fix a camera,
he'll show you how you fixed it

1856
01:44:40,978 --> 01:44:43,102
We must use some other technique

1857
01:44:43,185 --> 01:44:44,435
Something else

1858
01:44:45,185 --> 01:44:47,852
'Office calling'

1859
01:44:49,269 --> 01:44:51,060
Why is this ringing nonstop?

1860
01:44:51,102 --> 01:44:54,102
If my father went to work at 8
he'll be back home by 6:00 p.m

1861
01:44:54,185 --> 01:44:55,686
Next day he'll go at 8 again

1862
01:44:55,727 --> 01:44:57,727
This mobile rings 24x7

1863
01:44:57,769 --> 01:45:00,936
We get calls while eating, sleeping,
even when we are in the loo

1864
01:45:00,978 --> 01:45:04,269
Not only that, you get calls and
messages all the time...oh gawd!

1865
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:07,185
The world is so big out there
you're a corpse in that small box!

1866
01:45:07,269 --> 01:45:09,185
Break that...break that damn device

1867
01:45:09,269 --> 01:45:10,769
No...no...no...!

1868
01:45:11,602 --> 01:45:13,143
BREAK IT!

1869
01:45:13,727 --> 01:45:14,978
'Office calling'

1870
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:17,519
Good riddance to 'office calling'!

1871
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:19,894
- Just you wait!
- Don't break it, uncle

1872
01:45:19,936 --> 01:45:23,143
Doctor, let go of me!
I'll break my boss's head!

1873
01:45:24,936 --> 01:45:26,602
Uncle, don't do that

1874
01:45:32,185 --> 01:45:34,978
Dai, why did you break this phone now?

1875
01:45:35,561 --> 01:45:36,727
As if I did?

1876
01:45:36,769 --> 01:45:38,477
You instigated me to break it

1877
01:45:38,519 --> 01:45:40,477
I know I spoke but
why did you break it?

1878
01:45:40,519 --> 01:45:41,561
Isn't it your phone?

1879
01:45:41,561 --> 01:45:43,394
I broke it in a burst of emotion

1880
01:45:45,561 --> 01:45:46,644
Dai!

1881
01:45:47,561 --> 01:45:50,894
So all these years emotion has
been a constant, right?

1882
01:45:51,477 --> 01:45:54,769
We must lock Dharmaraj
by using emotion as the key

1883
01:45:54,811 --> 01:45:56,561
Do any of you understand me?

1884
01:45:56,644 --> 01:45:58,727
Wait...how do I say it?

1885
01:45:58,894 --> 01:46:02,602
Technology you are raving about
is recent and it will keep changing

1886
01:46:02,644 --> 01:46:04,352
But feelings we were born with

1887
01:46:04,394 --> 01:46:07,852
Hunger, taste, happiness, anger,
love, lust will never change

1888
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:10,644
Our mothers showed us
the moon and fed us

1889
01:46:10,686 --> 01:46:13,852
Mothers these days show
their mobiles and feed their babies

1890
01:46:13,894 --> 01:46:15,936
But feeding has not changed, right?

1891
01:46:15,978 --> 01:46:17,894
That love has not changed, right?

1892
01:46:18,644 --> 01:46:20,227
Certain things won't change

1893
01:46:21,269 --> 01:46:22,769
It will be old as gold

1894
01:46:23,769 --> 01:46:25,686
I'm the king of heritage & culture!

1895
01:46:27,352 --> 01:46:29,310
Pah! Incredible scene

1896
01:46:29,477 --> 01:46:30,894
Just tell me what to do

1897
01:46:30,936 --> 01:46:31,978
I'm ready

1898
01:46:38,394 --> 01:46:42,727
We don't need surveillance cameras
to check on Dharmaraj's movements

1899
01:46:42,769 --> 01:46:44,143
This human being will do

1900
01:46:44,185 --> 01:46:46,561
'A lonely watchman will
welcome with open arms'

1901
01:46:46,602 --> 01:46:48,769
'...someone who respects
and chats with him'

1902
01:46:48,852 --> 01:46:52,185
If we want to befriend someone
ideal is to make them laugh

1903
01:46:52,269 --> 01:46:54,352
Problem is he can identify us

1904
01:46:54,394 --> 01:46:55,435
So-

1905
01:46:56,394 --> 01:46:57,936
Doctor, it's no big deal

1906
01:46:57,978 --> 01:47:01,852
You just approach him casually
to ask an address and crack a joke

1907
01:47:01,894 --> 01:47:05,352
It is a bland joke but as soon as
you tell him you start laughing

1908
01:47:05,394 --> 01:47:06,561
Then he has to laugh

1909
01:47:06,602 --> 01:47:08,185
What is the joke?

1910
01:47:08,394 --> 01:47:12,185
'Then mozhi, Kani mozhi, Ilam mozhi'

1911
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:22,394
- Is this a joke?
- Too much!

1912
01:47:22,435 --> 01:47:24,936
- Do you know this address?
- This one?

1913
01:47:24,978 --> 01:47:26,519
Yes, the same

1914
01:47:28,269 --> 01:47:30,561
So very simple
Tomorrow go up to him and-

1915
01:47:30,602 --> 01:47:32,102
Won't he get suspicious?

1916
01:47:32,769 --> 01:47:37,310
Right, but if you take your dog
for a walk, even if it is another area

1917
01:47:37,352 --> 01:47:39,352
- 'No one will suspect you'
- Cooperate with me

1918
01:47:39,394 --> 01:47:41,352
- Bro
- Walking, huh?

1919
01:47:41,602 --> 01:47:43,143
Look! My dog is saying 'yes'

1920
01:47:43,185 --> 01:47:45,561
Can't meet your boss at all these days?

1921
01:47:45,602 --> 01:47:47,644
- He's very busy
- When did you come?

1922
01:47:47,686 --> 01:47:50,644
- I came yesterday at 6:00 a.m
- He comes only at 10'o clock

1923
01:47:50,686 --> 01:47:53,769
- I came at 8:00 p.m, bro
- He leaves by 3:00 p.m usually

1924
01:47:53,811 --> 01:47:55,561
Shall I come at 2:00 p.m tomorrow?

1925
01:47:55,561 --> 01:47:58,561
At 2:00 p.m he is garlanding
our leader's statue

1926
01:47:58,644 --> 01:47:59,644
OH!

1927
01:47:59,936 --> 01:48:01,561
Bye, bro

1928
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:04,520
Caste

1929
01:48:06,396 --> 01:48:08,104
[crowd cheering]

1930
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:22,020
Yov! Are you God's gift to mankind
just because of your royal lineage?

1931
01:48:22,062 --> 01:48:24,229
Until yesterday, you were
an illegitimate mongrel

1932
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:26,104
Who the hell are you?

1933
01:48:26,312 --> 01:48:28,229
Who the eff are you?

1934
01:48:28,979 --> 01:48:30,354
Silence...silence!

1935
01:48:38,937 --> 01:48:40,937
Make way for our leader

1936
01:48:40,979 --> 01:48:43,396
Move aside
You come along, bro

1937
01:48:50,687 --> 01:48:52,020
Get out of my way

1938
01:48:52,062 --> 01:48:53,062
Hey! Move

1939
01:48:53,853 --> 01:48:55,770
- I'll kill you
- They locked me in, bro

1940
01:48:59,895 --> 01:49:01,229
You are bleeding, bro?

1941
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:10,270
'If you wash fish in clean water daily
Will it lose its innate stink, tell me?'

1942
01:49:10,312 --> 01:49:11,478
Will it go, man?

1943
01:49:12,229 --> 01:49:15,187
That...was not aimed at your hand, man

1944
01:49:15,229 --> 01:49:17,561
It was aimed at your neck!

1945
01:49:17,853 --> 01:49:20,229
Rope of Lord Yama,
God of Death

1946
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:22,979
...is now in the hands
of your close associate

1947
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:25,937
Someone by your side always
will send you to the grave

1948
01:49:25,979 --> 01:49:28,603
Sins you committed
these 16 long years...

1949
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:30,937
...have started rolling
their dice against you

1950
01:49:30,979 --> 01:49:33,520
Your steps are heading towards the grave

1951
01:49:35,603 --> 01:49:37,937
What...?
Don't you believe me?

1952
01:49:37,979 --> 01:49:40,396
Only if you are alive
the day after tomorrow!

1953
01:49:42,312 --> 01:49:45,145
Do you want to look for
redemption of your sins?

1954
01:49:45,187 --> 01:49:49,812
Visit Lord Shiva at Rudra temple
and beg for salvation

1955
01:49:49,895 --> 01:49:52,979
Your fort is crumbling
Your game is tumbling

1956
01:49:53,145 --> 01:49:55,187
Your chapter is closed, man

1957
01:49:56,187 --> 01:49:58,728
Suspicion, superstition

1958
01:49:58,979 --> 01:50:00,104
Fear

1959
01:50:03,979 --> 01:50:06,979
Now whatever happens
will be ominous in his eyes

1960
01:50:09,354 --> 01:50:11,396
Hey! Black cat
Stop...stop!

1961
01:50:19,603 --> 01:50:21,104
'Tomorrow is your last day!!!'

1962
01:50:21,187 --> 01:50:22,895
Hey! Catch him
Get hold of him

1963
01:50:22,937 --> 01:50:24,979
How can you nab him
if all of you are seated?

1964
01:50:26,396 --> 01:50:27,396
Scum bags!

1965
01:50:27,478 --> 01:50:29,396
This is an offer from
Lalitha Jewellery

1966
01:50:29,478 --> 01:50:31,770
Tomorrow is the last day it seems!

1967
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:37,312
Hey! Having a dig at me?

1968
01:50:38,354 --> 01:50:39,478
Start the car

1969
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:53,062
That doesn't work, bro

1970
01:50:53,104 --> 01:50:55,354
- Only my seat belt is stuck?
- Yes

1971
01:50:55,396 --> 01:50:57,937
- Okay, take this left
- No, we can turn right, bro

1972
01:50:57,979 --> 01:50:59,312
No need
Turn left now

1973
01:50:59,354 --> 01:51:01,062
- I'll turn right
- Turn left now

1974
01:51:01,104 --> 01:51:03,478
If we turn right
we'll reach our final destination

1975
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,645
Final destination?

1976
01:51:04,687 --> 01:51:06,520
Is this some conspiracy?

1977
01:51:06,561 --> 01:51:09,062
- Why are you going right?
- Hey! Go right

1978
01:51:09,104 --> 01:51:10,396
Turn left, I say

1979
01:51:16,645 --> 01:51:17,687
Where are you off to?

1980
01:51:17,728 --> 01:51:19,603
Sir, I have to attend
to the next patient

1981
01:51:19,645 --> 01:51:22,104
Please come back soon
I'm a bit scared

1982
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,270
- What's this?
- Milk

1983
01:51:44,728 --> 01:51:45,895
You drink it

1984
01:51:46,187 --> 01:51:47,270
No need, bro

1985
01:51:47,312 --> 01:51:48,478
Drink it, man

1986
01:51:48,687 --> 01:51:50,354
- I don't want, bro
- Why?

1987
01:51:50,396 --> 01:51:52,062
If it's plain milk I don't mind

1988
01:51:52,104 --> 01:51:53,396
What did you mix then?

1989
01:51:53,478 --> 01:51:55,270
I added sugar
I am diabetic!

1990
01:51:55,312 --> 01:51:57,645
No one is disease free in our group-

1991
01:52:00,145 --> 01:52:01,229
You drink it

1992
01:52:01,396 --> 01:52:02,812
I don't want, bro

1993
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:05,853
Do you have high blood pressure?

1994
01:52:05,895 --> 01:52:08,645
- You can't trust him, bro
- Bloody traitor of a tortoise!

1995
01:52:08,687 --> 01:52:10,812
How dare you, couch potato!

1996
01:52:10,895 --> 01:52:13,687
Bro, even now he created
bad blood in the function

1997
01:52:13,812 --> 01:52:15,770
- To start a commotion
- True that!

1998
01:52:15,937 --> 01:52:17,812
Who is a spinning top with no hook?

1999
01:52:17,937 --> 01:52:19,979
'Whole world knows
you are vegetating!'

2000
01:52:19,979 --> 01:52:23,645
'I knew from the beginning
he should not be trusted'

2001
01:52:24,187 --> 01:52:25,979
Move, why are you fighting here?

2002
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:28,020
'Instead of giving apple to our boss?'

2003
01:52:30,396 --> 01:52:31,478
Nurse

2004
01:52:31,770 --> 01:52:32,853
Discharge!

2005
01:53:12,812 --> 01:53:14,270
[dog howling]

2006
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:22,645
I can hear a dog howling

2007
01:53:22,687 --> 01:53:23,937
My heart is racing

2008
01:53:24,104 --> 01:53:25,687
I'm scared too

2009
01:53:38,354 --> 01:53:40,895
[sinister whispers]

2010
01:53:56,270 --> 01:53:57,687
What is this?

2011
01:53:57,770 --> 01:53:59,979
Why are you standing all around me?

2012
01:54:00,895 --> 01:54:03,062
You are even holding weapons

2013
01:54:03,145 --> 01:54:05,104
You are in some trouble, bro

2014
01:54:05,145 --> 01:54:06,853
Problem for me?

2015
01:54:07,145 --> 01:54:08,853
Problem is only because of all of you

2016
01:54:08,895 --> 01:54:10,145
How are we to blame?

2017
01:54:10,187 --> 01:54:12,478
Who slashed my arm?

2018
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:16,645
I went to the temple for your sake
and brought you God's offerings, bro

2019
01:54:24,229 --> 01:54:26,020
Why is that blade in your hand?

2020
01:54:26,687 --> 01:54:28,062
So are you the culprit?

2021
01:54:28,937 --> 01:54:32,396
You wretched fellow!
How could you do this to our bro?

2022
01:54:33,145 --> 01:54:35,979
You refused to trust me
Look how he backstabbed you!

2023
01:54:37,937 --> 01:54:40,603
'Come out and we know
how to handle you!'

2024
01:54:42,187 --> 01:54:43,812
'Tomorrow is the last day!'

2025
01:54:46,229 --> 01:54:48,104
'We'll reach our final destination'

2026
01:54:48,478 --> 01:54:50,104
'He isn't trustworthy, bro'

2027
01:54:50,145 --> 01:54:51,853
'We'll reach our final destination'

2028
01:54:52,396 --> 01:54:54,229
'He isn't trustworthy, bro'

2029
01:54:58,396 --> 01:55:01,561
'Visit Lord Shiva at Rudra temple
and beg for salvation'

2030
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:03,020
If he gets scared...

2031
01:55:03,478 --> 01:55:04,603
Hey!

2032
01:55:05,229 --> 01:55:06,520
He's the traitor

2033
01:55:07,603 --> 01:55:10,728
Listen, I don't trust any of you

2034
01:55:11,229 --> 01:55:12,979
All of you clear out right now

2035
01:55:13,145 --> 01:55:14,812
- Leave
- Bro

2036
01:55:14,853 --> 01:55:16,354
Are you scared, bro?

2037
01:55:16,645 --> 01:55:18,895
- Is it that obvious?
- Yes, bro

2038
01:55:19,396 --> 01:55:23,020
At least for a week, go
I don't want anyone with me

2039
01:55:23,062 --> 01:55:24,062
Leave me alone

2040
01:55:24,104 --> 01:55:25,312
GO NOW

2041
01:55:26,603 --> 01:55:27,937
Banu, listen

2042
01:55:27,979 --> 01:55:31,104
Make arrangements for me
to go to the temple tomorrow

2043
01:55:31,478 --> 01:55:35,104
Before the inauspicious time tomorrow
he will set out to the temple

2044
01:55:35,145 --> 01:55:37,187
'Watchman will go to
drink tea at 4:00 p.m'

2045
01:55:37,229 --> 01:55:39,312
'It's 4'o clock
I'll go drink my cup of tea'

2046
01:55:39,354 --> 01:55:40,937
We should enter in that gap

2047
01:55:40,979 --> 01:55:43,270
So we should ensure
the watchman doesn't return

2048
01:55:43,312 --> 01:55:44,728
But how...?

2049
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:46,478
I'll suggest something

2050
01:55:46,687 --> 01:55:48,312
But no one should yell at me

2051
01:55:48,354 --> 01:55:49,396
Shoot

2052
01:55:50,062 --> 01:55:51,104
Desire!

2053
01:56:00,270 --> 01:56:01,312
Aunty...?

2054
01:56:04,603 --> 01:56:06,312
You haven't aged one bit

2055
01:56:08,561 --> 01:56:10,603
'We will mix a sedative in that batter'

2056
01:56:10,645 --> 01:56:13,770
Someone will be in his house
His mother or wife, right?

2057
01:56:13,812 --> 01:56:15,520
What do you say, Nagaraj?

2058
01:56:15,561 --> 01:56:17,229
- For sure
- Then?

2059
01:56:17,396 --> 01:56:20,187
We'll enter claiming to be their relatives

2060
01:56:21,603 --> 01:56:24,937
'Whoever it is, we generally talk
to strangers outside the door'

2061
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:27,645
'But if a relative turns up
with an invitation'

2062
01:56:27,895 --> 01:56:29,520
I'm your uncle from Malayanur, dear

2063
01:56:29,561 --> 01:56:30,937
'They won't be suspicious'

2064
01:56:30,979 --> 01:56:33,229
'They will open their doors wide
invite the guests in'

2065
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:35,812
'That is our tradition
and our famous hospitality'

2066
01:56:35,853 --> 01:56:37,770
- Who are they, ma?
- I don't know, da

2067
01:56:37,812 --> 01:56:40,187
How can I ask?
Must be from your father's side

2068
01:56:40,229 --> 01:56:43,145
So you, me, Nikitha, doctor

2069
01:56:43,187 --> 01:56:45,478
- We will go to his house
- What about me?

2070
01:56:45,603 --> 01:56:49,145
If there's some problem tomorrow
we will all be behind bars

2071
01:56:50,354 --> 01:56:52,561
We need someone to bail us out, right?

2072
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:54,853
So don't come there

2073
01:56:56,104 --> 01:56:58,853
I have an important meeting
in my office tomorrow

2074
01:56:58,895 --> 01:57:00,728
Why don't you all go?

2075
01:57:00,937 --> 01:57:03,354
Even the doctor is willing
What's your problem?

2076
01:57:06,354 --> 01:57:07,354
So...?

2077
01:57:07,478 --> 01:57:08,478
So...?

2078
01:57:14,062 --> 01:57:16,895
Yov security!
I'm going to the temple

2079
01:57:16,937 --> 01:57:18,062
Take care of the house

2080
01:57:18,104 --> 01:57:19,104
'Okay, sir'

2081
01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:22,020
'We are waiting
All roads are flooded'

2082
01:57:22,062 --> 01:57:25,145
'But still as per our weather forecast
heavy downpour expected'

2083
01:57:25,187 --> 01:57:26,812
'So be safe wherever you are'

2084
01:58:18,312 --> 01:58:19,979
What about the CCTV camera?

2085
01:58:26,062 --> 01:58:27,853
She seems to be new to this area

2086
01:58:27,895 --> 01:58:29,645
How does area matter
for a mobile eatery?

2087
01:58:29,687 --> 01:58:31,687
'Taste my hot 'bhajji'
in this rain, sir'

2088
01:58:36,396 --> 01:58:38,229
Vanakkam, how are you?

2089
01:58:38,645 --> 01:58:39,853
Vanakkam

2090
01:58:41,187 --> 01:58:43,104
'We've been childless for 20 years'

2091
01:58:44,895 --> 01:58:47,229
- You are...?
- Your uncle from Thollamur, dear

2092
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:48,603
Don't you remember me?

2093
01:58:48,645 --> 01:58:51,312
I saw you as a baby
You've grown up so much

2094
01:58:53,312 --> 01:58:54,354
- You are...?
- Aiyo!

2095
01:58:54,396 --> 01:58:56,270
You are Dharma anna's wife?

2096
01:58:56,312 --> 01:58:58,895
I couldn't recognise you
that day in the hospital, dear

2097
01:58:58,937 --> 01:59:00,561
We've come to invite you
for the wedding

2098
01:59:01,603 --> 01:59:03,354
'Brought betel nut
and the whole works'

2099
01:59:08,561 --> 01:59:10,020
Please come inside

2100
01:59:20,645 --> 01:59:21,895
Move...move aside

2101
01:59:24,396 --> 01:59:25,354
Sunstroke!

2102
01:59:25,396 --> 01:59:27,354
It's raining, how can you say sunstroke?

2103
01:59:27,396 --> 01:59:29,728
Hey! I'm a 'Thalapathy' fan
I won't lie

2104
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:32,229
Lift him, size of a 'bhajji' and
hitting on the fritter aunty!

2105
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:34,145
- Please sit down
- How's Dharma anna?

2106
01:59:34,187 --> 01:59:36,062
I saw him as a baby
Always in his birthday suit!

2107
01:59:36,104 --> 01:59:38,187
He's fine
He has gone out now

2108
01:59:38,229 --> 01:59:39,354
Wait, I'll call him

2109
01:59:39,396 --> 01:59:41,728
Don't trouble yourself
I just spoke to him

2110
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:43,812
He has gone to a temple
for some redemption

2111
01:59:43,853 --> 01:59:44,812
Yes

2112
01:59:44,853 --> 01:59:48,187
I invited Thollamur uncle and
Rajavel uncle this side of town

2113
01:59:48,229 --> 01:59:51,979
Then I invited our brothers-in-law
Shekar and Murugadas in Senji

2114
01:59:51,979 --> 01:59:54,062
Whether Dharma anna
was at home or not

2115
01:59:54,104 --> 01:59:56,895
I wanted to invite you personally
and then head back home

2116
02:00:00,229 --> 02:00:02,895
How has your hair suddenly turned grey?

2117
02:00:04,187 --> 02:00:05,770
This is only original

2118
02:00:05,812 --> 02:00:06,979
That was dye!

2119
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:08,354
- Hello?
- 'Hello?'

2120
02:00:08,396 --> 02:00:10,478
'Come to Koovathur immediately, bro'

2121
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:12,396
Koovathur? Why?

2122
02:00:12,478 --> 02:00:14,145
'Urgent meeting it seems'

2123
02:00:14,229 --> 02:00:17,895
'Whoever doesn't turn up will be
eliminated from the party, come soon'

2124
02:00:21,062 --> 02:00:22,396
How are you related to him?

2125
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,312
- Thollamur uncle, dear
- That's you

2126
02:00:24,354 --> 02:00:25,979
- 'Yes, right?'
- I asked about you

2127
02:00:25,979 --> 02:00:27,645
Uncle's brother-in-law

2128
02:00:27,812 --> 02:00:29,770
But he doesn't have any relatives

2129
02:00:29,812 --> 02:00:32,020
I'm related to you, not that uncle

2130
02:00:32,062 --> 02:00:33,104
Related to me?

2131
02:00:33,145 --> 02:00:34,645
Last I saw was at your wedding

2132
02:00:34,687 --> 02:00:36,104
- Whom did you see?
- Someone!

2133
02:00:36,145 --> 02:00:38,770
Why do you keep prodding?
You are just like your father

2134
02:00:38,812 --> 02:00:40,478
Always doubting your relatives!

2135
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:44,020
That's alright, but why is it
both of you are sweating so much?

2136
02:00:44,728 --> 02:00:46,687
I can ask you the same question

2137
02:00:46,770 --> 02:00:48,354
I am pregnant

2138
02:00:48,396 --> 02:00:49,979
My face is unpleasant!

2139
02:00:49,979 --> 02:00:53,187
Nothing of that sort, dear
They are both diabetic

2140
02:00:53,229 --> 02:00:54,937
Can they go for a walk right here?

2141
02:00:54,979 --> 02:00:57,020
'Doctor has told us to walk in the rain'

2142
02:00:57,062 --> 02:00:58,187
- Go...go
- Get up

2143
02:00:58,229 --> 02:00:59,478
Is Dharma diabetic?

2144
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,853
- Sugar level has decreased
- I should walk regularly too

2145
02:01:01,895 --> 02:01:02,895
Who is that?

2146
02:01:05,961 --> 02:01:08,128
Water level is rising
in the rains, madam

2147
02:01:08,169 --> 02:01:10,794
'Have you kept your valuables safe?'

2148
02:01:10,836 --> 02:01:12,044
Only at such times

2149
02:01:12,086 --> 02:01:13,919
'...thieves will be on the prowl'

2150
02:01:14,169 --> 02:01:16,002
Everything is under lock and key?

2151
02:01:16,044 --> 02:01:17,128
Yes

2152
02:01:18,044 --> 02:01:19,794
- Locked?
- Yes, of course

2153
02:01:19,836 --> 02:01:21,169
Take care, madam

2154
02:01:26,211 --> 02:01:29,503
'Even if we are confident
we have locked our house'

2155
02:01:29,545 --> 02:01:31,211
'Have you locked it?'

2156
02:01:31,253 --> 02:01:32,752
'If someone asks you'

2157
02:01:34,169 --> 02:01:35,669
1 minute
I'll be with you

2158
02:02:11,294 --> 02:02:12,961
1 minute is enough to flick it

2159
02:02:13,002 --> 02:02:14,128
Stuff it into our bag-

2160
02:02:14,128 --> 02:02:16,378
By the way who is getting married?

2161
02:02:16,419 --> 02:02:17,836
- Their daughter
- His daughter!

2162
02:02:20,169 --> 02:02:22,128
Correct, for my daughter

2163
02:02:22,169 --> 02:02:24,294
He treats my daughter like his own

2164
02:02:24,336 --> 02:02:27,919
Sometimes my wife tells
my daughter 'he is your father'

2165
02:02:27,961 --> 02:02:29,877
Imagine how close their bond is

2166
02:02:30,794 --> 02:02:33,044
- You have a daughter
- Just born

2167
02:02:34,503 --> 02:02:36,211
Smells like a gas leak from your stove?

2168
02:02:36,253 --> 02:02:37,253
'Yes, you're right'

2169
02:02:37,294 --> 02:02:39,169
Your nose is blocked
Stove may explode

2170
02:02:39,211 --> 02:02:42,169
Better check, you are
Dharmaraj's one and only wife

2171
02:03:46,294 --> 02:03:47,794
What are you doing?

2172
02:03:49,961 --> 02:03:50,961
Nothin-

2173
02:03:53,211 --> 02:03:55,044
- Don't call
- Let's go

2174
02:03:56,710 --> 02:03:59,128
Don't call
Nikitha, you go

2175
02:03:59,752 --> 02:04:00,877
- Hey!
- No

2176
02:04:00,919 --> 02:04:02,169
I'm telling you, go

2177
02:04:02,211 --> 02:04:04,419
Please, madam
Listen to our story

2178
02:04:04,461 --> 02:04:06,378
- Don't come near me
- I'll fall at your feet

2179
02:04:06,461 --> 02:04:07,794
- Don't call anyone
- No

2180
02:04:10,961 --> 02:04:12,211
Kindly let me speak

2181
02:04:12,961 --> 02:04:14,503
Listen...my dear!

2182
02:04:14,545 --> 02:04:15,752
Sir!

2183
02:04:15,836 --> 02:04:16,836
Look here

2184
02:04:18,128 --> 02:04:20,710
You can't use your phone here
Orders from our boss

2185
02:04:20,752 --> 02:04:23,710
My wife is all alone at home
Looks like she's in some trouble

2186
02:04:23,752 --> 02:04:26,128
- I must talk to her, give it!
- No, sir, sorry

2187
02:04:26,128 --> 02:04:27,128
- I'll leave then
- Sir

2188
02:04:27,169 --> 02:04:29,128
Our orders, sir
You can't go outside

2189
02:04:29,169 --> 02:04:32,128
I haven't had a baby for 20 years

2190
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:33,961
My wife has conceived now

2191
02:04:34,002 --> 02:04:37,545
If something untoward happens to her
I will kill all of you, move aside

2192
02:04:37,669 --> 02:04:39,336
- Don't call
- Hear us out

2193
02:04:39,461 --> 02:04:40,919
- Akka, listen
- Give this

2194
02:04:41,002 --> 02:04:42,128
Keep it

2195
02:04:42,169 --> 02:04:43,752
Don't call anyone
We are leaving

2196
02:04:43,794 --> 02:04:46,044
- Let's go
- Wait, 1 minute

2197
02:04:46,086 --> 02:04:48,253
Akka, the other day
you said 'believe in God'

2198
02:04:48,294 --> 02:04:50,086
'He will never let us down'

2199
02:04:50,128 --> 02:04:52,128
God gave me that Dhokra statuette, akka

2200
02:04:52,169 --> 02:04:54,002
My family is dependent on this

2201
02:04:54,044 --> 02:04:55,253
It belongs to me
You know-

2202
02:04:55,294 --> 02:04:56,752
No, I don't know all that

2203
02:04:56,836 --> 02:04:58,919
You discuss his problem with him

2204
02:04:58,961 --> 02:05:00,961
- I don't know all that
- I swear, 1 track mind!

2205
02:05:01,002 --> 02:05:02,128
I'll call him, wait

2206
02:05:02,211 --> 02:05:03,961
I told you we are leaving

2207
02:05:04,044 --> 02:05:06,128
- Let's go
- Wait, da

2208
02:05:07,503 --> 02:05:10,545
Won't you narrate
a bedtime story to your baby?

2209
02:05:10,627 --> 02:05:11,669
Tell your child then

2210
02:05:11,710 --> 02:05:15,044
16 years ago was a man
Your father made him slip into coma

2211
02:05:15,086 --> 02:05:18,461
When he wanted to lead a normal life
your father stole what was rightfully his

2212
02:05:18,503 --> 02:05:22,294
Tell your child 'Only then you were born
God will protect you always'

2213
02:05:24,836 --> 02:05:26,128
- Banu
- Listen, dear

2214
02:05:26,169 --> 02:05:28,336
Don't, we are leaving now

2215
02:05:29,253 --> 02:05:30,378
Banu...!

2216
02:05:34,503 --> 02:05:36,169
Banu...Banu!

2217
02:05:48,044 --> 02:05:49,128
Let's scoot

2218
02:05:49,211 --> 02:05:50,961
Where are you going?

2219
02:05:51,044 --> 02:05:53,627
- Can't leave her-
- Only she knows we came

2220
02:05:53,669 --> 02:05:55,877
If she recovers
Dharmaraj will dice us to bits

2221
02:05:55,919 --> 02:05:57,836
Listen to me
Let's escape

2222
02:05:57,877 --> 02:05:59,169
' Don't stand there'

2223
02:05:59,211 --> 02:06:00,378
'Come right now'

2224
02:06:05,752 --> 02:06:09,044
Admit me in hospital please

2225
02:06:12,002 --> 02:06:13,086
Watchman!

2226
02:06:13,627 --> 02:06:15,128
Can't reach anyone

2227
02:06:25,169 --> 02:06:27,294
Why are you stopping?
Hurry up...let's go

2228
02:06:28,378 --> 02:06:31,211
Only thing we have left is
humanitarian concern

2229
02:06:31,752 --> 02:06:33,627
Let us not kill that too

2230
02:06:36,253 --> 02:06:38,211
You are the father of 2 boys too

2231
02:06:49,419 --> 02:06:52,294
Those fancy cabs
Call Ola or Uber, whatever

2232
02:06:52,378 --> 02:06:54,836
'Continuous downpour in Chennai
for the past 3 days'

2233
02:06:54,877 --> 02:06:58,169
'Power outage, no ATM,
mobile network or internet'

2234
02:07:01,002 --> 02:07:05,086
'At her age she won't have the strength
to carry her baby full term'

2235
02:07:05,128 --> 02:07:06,919
'You must take utmost precautions'

2236
02:07:06,961 --> 02:07:08,169
'Reason I keep insisting'

2237
02:07:08,211 --> 02:07:11,294
She has no chance to conceive again

2238
02:07:11,378 --> 02:07:13,211
Can't get a cab in Uber or Ola

2239
02:07:13,253 --> 02:07:15,128
No signal at all
Total network failure

2240
02:07:15,336 --> 02:07:16,545
What the hell-

2241
02:07:16,752 --> 02:07:17,836
Get lost!

2242
02:07:18,211 --> 02:07:20,044
Stop...anna

2243
02:07:21,211 --> 02:07:22,461
What, sir?

2244
02:07:23,877 --> 02:07:25,419
Take me to the hospital urgently

2245
02:07:25,461 --> 02:07:28,627
Heavy rain, sir
Road is blocked over there

2246
02:07:28,669 --> 02:07:31,002
Knee deep water
Auto can't ply in that area

2247
02:07:31,044 --> 02:07:32,877
Delivery case, bro

2248
02:07:33,253 --> 02:07:34,378
'Wait, akka'

2249
02:07:37,461 --> 02:07:39,211
I'll try my best
Bring her, sir

2250
02:07:39,253 --> 02:07:40,294
Thanks, bro

2251
02:07:43,128 --> 02:07:44,836
- You go, I'll manage
- Take care

2252
02:08:02,961 --> 02:08:05,794
Please bear the pain, madam
We are almost there

2253
02:08:07,419 --> 02:08:10,503
- Sir, isn't she MLA's wife?
- Yes, bro

2254
02:08:14,086 --> 02:08:16,336
Hey! Drive slowly

2255
02:08:30,545 --> 02:08:33,336
- What happened?
- Auto is stuck, not starting

2256
02:08:36,669 --> 02:08:40,128
I can't bear the pain

2257
02:08:43,627 --> 02:08:48,128
'If someone cries in front of us
or confides their worries'

2258
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:50,211
'...they are not expecting us to solve it'

2259
02:08:50,253 --> 02:08:52,086
'Won't someone hold our hands and say'

2260
02:08:52,128 --> 02:08:54,461
'I'm there for you
Don't be scared'

2261
02:08:54,503 --> 02:08:56,877
'These are the only words
of comfort they expect'

2262
02:08:57,253 --> 02:08:59,128
Listen to me
Look at me

2263
02:08:59,378 --> 02:09:00,836
I'm here for you

2264
02:09:02,378 --> 02:09:04,419
You'll be fine

Your wife has been
taken to Global hospital

02:12:24,002 --> 02:12:25,378
Global Hospital?

Who brought you here, dear?

02:13:45,128 --> 02:13:46,461
I don't know

2309
02:13:46,961 --> 02:13:48,752
I was screaming in pain

2310
02:13:50,253 --> 02:13:53,669
God sent me someone from the road

2311
02:13:54,086 --> 02:13:55,545
The pain was unbearable

2312
02:13:57,378 --> 02:13:59,378
He said, 'I'm there for you'

2313
02:13:59,419 --> 02:14:00,545
Nothing else

2314
02:14:03,253 --> 02:14:06,545
If he hadn't come at that moment
I swear we would've lost our baby

2315
02:14:12,752 --> 02:14:15,128
Only God saved me

2320
02:14:30,294 --> 02:14:32,419

without paying the bill
