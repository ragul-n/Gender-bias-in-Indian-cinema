1
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,040
Tony... staying at this side of
kolkata has a different feeling...

2
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
Still less crowded... no pollution

3
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,120
No crowded footpath...
and the main thing is...

4
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,040
relax while driving...

5
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
Huhhh...

6
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,080
Leave this tension of searching house...

7
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,600
Think ...if this road was not finished...

8
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,200
would have been great...

9
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,720
But for that a bike is
needed instesd of car...

10
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,440
Yes... bike is needed...

11
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,640
Pappu told... he will
wait here with bike...

12
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
where is he?

13
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,920
Pappu...

14
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,480
Actully my nick name is little difficult...
so everyone calls me Pappu...

15
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,760
Sir, I use to supply everything
beside flats and houses...

16
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,520
Like... maid, plumber, electrician...

17
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,960
Everything that you want...

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,040
Let see the flat first...

19
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,080
Oh yes... you follow me...

20
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Please come...

21
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,480
You told that it's a new appartment...

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
then why the lift is
making so much sound...

23
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,720
That doesn't matter...

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,960
It's all about maintainance...

25
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,600
Come... come...

26
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,920
Please come...

27
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,960
Look at the stairs...

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
You won't find anywhere at this price...

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,000
Mam... see this open kitchen...

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,760
Here... marble top, chimney and exhaust...

31
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
why it's so tight?

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,720
Don't pull... it will break...

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,480
This exhaust is broken...

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,240
It will be repaired...

35
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,840
Come and see the bedroom...

36
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
come...

37
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
This is bedroom...

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,840
Everwhere it's light...

39
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,640
And breeze comes from everywhere...

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,920
This side is south-east...

41
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,640
From here you can see the whole kolkata...

42
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,600
And you can do plantation here...

43
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,240
What a nice view...

44
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,000
You will never get this in kolkata...

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,280
Sir, please come and see another bedroom...

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Let's go...

47
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
come...

48
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,920
You can use the bedroom below also...

49
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,440
but there is a question of privacy...
isn't it madam...

50
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,840
And then everything is up to you...

51
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,680
This is your another bedroom...

52
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,760
lock this tightly...

53
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,960
So what's your decision?

54
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
I liked it...

55
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Me too...

56
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,400
A flat like this at a cheap rate...

57
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
You won't get...

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,720
Mr. Pappu...

59
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,880
What about sweeper...

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,720
Don't think about such small matters...

61
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,240
Why it's not opening...

62
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,800
Listen... this door is not opening...

63
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Not opening?

64
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
What's the matter?

65
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Oh yes...

66
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,920
Actully goods are kept here...

67
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,920
Store room?

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,520
Yes store room... but it cannot be open...

69
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Why?

70
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,920
Landlord's goods are kept...
so can't open...

71
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,000
Rest... everything is ok...

72
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
ok...

73
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:34,960
What to do?

74
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,480
No problem... we will manage...

75
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,000
Then also... request him to open...

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
Rest of the thing?

77
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Ok...

78
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,600
Can you request to open the room...

79
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,520
No... no... it's not possible...

80
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
Listen... showed you such a good flat...

81
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,960
Everything is ok here...

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,240
It has only a little problem...

83
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,720
Next week..we are shifting here...

84
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Ohhh... say that...

85
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
I was telling that...

86
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
If you give the cheque within two days...

87
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,520
My mother-in-law's happy
birthday is near... so...

88
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,840
It's a family case... so...

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,600
Don't worry about the garage...

90
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,400
I am talking with the committee...

91
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,240
You can park one car there...

92
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,680
Lets decorate our wishes...

93
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,880

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,360

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,280
We are ready to get wet in rain today...

99
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,240

100
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,640
Lets decorate our wishes...

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,280
With you in every steps...

102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,280
Let's fly then today...

103

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,400
ohh God... What you did?

105
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,960
No..I didn't do yet...

106
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,360
Will start now... celebration...

107
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,280
It's a new carpet... have to clean again...

108
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,800
You behave such a way...

109
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,160
Just started a celebration...

110
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,560
You are so boring...

111
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,920
New flat... new begining... hold it...

112
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,960
I was thinking to invite my parents once...

113
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Why?

114
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,800
Mother called me...

115
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Suddenly...

116
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,640
You went downstairs then...

117
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Was just talking...

118
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,280
Have changed my mind or not...

119
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
She was missing me...

120
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Understand...

121
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,040
Someone got married and brought her home...

122
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,520
Parents will be tensioned...

123
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,240
Why you make me remember
this again and again...

124
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,560
It was my decision too...

125
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,680
It's naturl for parents to get tensioned...

126
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Listen...

127
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,680
You feel very bad?

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
For what?

129
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,360
You didn't get the love as son-in-law...

130
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,880
After a fight... we had to leave...

131
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Really...

132
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Whose loss is more...

133
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,640
Your parents or mine...

134
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,800
Listen... after getting such a good
son-in-law like me... if they cannot then...

135
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,600
Ohhh... Really...

136
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,640
But a flat like this at so cheap rent...

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
Just think... what I did...

138
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,400
You... just a minute...

139
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
You did... means...

140
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,360
You want to that this flat is only
your choice... and not mine...

141
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,880
Yes your choice is also very nice...

142
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,560
Really?
Yes...

143
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,400
How did you know this?

144
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
Yes... it can be known by seeing me...

145
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Ok the main thing is...

146
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
About loving...

147
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Loving is an art...

148
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,040
Really...

149
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Yes...

150
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Everyone can't do this...

151
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,000
Take out my suitcase...

152
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,320
When is your flight tomorrow?

153
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
7.15 am...

154
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,640
I am thinking to leave at 5.45 am...

155
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,800
It's take only 10 minutes from here...

156
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,240
Yes...

157
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Will book a cab...

158
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,880
Why cab... I will drop you...

159
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Not needed...

160
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,440
Have no confidence...

161
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,600
Tony... what happened? sit down...

162
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,840

163
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Water please...

164
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Take it...

165
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
what happened?

166
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,600
Nothing...

167
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,320
What nothing? I witnessed it...

168
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,360
Nothing... I'm telling that I'm fine...

169
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,200
I'm calling the doctor...

170
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,360
Again doctor...

171
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,680
Ok... I'll visit to the doctor...

172
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840

173
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Listen... get ready the kyc documents...

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,320
Have to open the bank account
after returnig... it's urgent...

175
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,040
Why you need to open a new account...

176
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,720
I have my account... join with it...

177
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,200
That's good... it would be easier...

178
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,360
Will do it then...

179
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,400
Have you took your mobile...

180
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
Listen I'm leaving...

181
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,200
Ohh I forgot to tell...

182
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,560
I asked Pappu for a maid...

183
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,600
He told security... maid will come today...

184
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
You talk with her...

185
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm leaving...

186
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,400
Don't forget to call the doctor...

Yes... I'll...

188
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
Go carefully...

189

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,280
Not for that... have problem...

210
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,520
To return home...

211
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,800
It's a problem... if you do like this...

212
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,640
You told guard... day before yesterday...

213
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,360
Did anyone come yet...

214
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
No...

215
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760

216
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880

217
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040

218
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,160
Tomorrow I"ll come early...

219
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,680
Mom..I'm fine...

220
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
You don't get upset...

221
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,920
Tell me... the phase I
was passing through...

222
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,640
It was possible to get out of
that trauma without Arka...

223
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,080
Listen... now you come to my flat...

224
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,680
Ok it's my responsibility
to convince Dad...

225
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,040
Ok I'm keeping the phone...

226
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,200
Sir, everyday I do at least 10 deals...

227
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,760
It's not possible for me to know
what is happening in these houses...

228
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,600
And every house has a problem

229
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Bye Sir...

230
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,400

232
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,760
Sir, tell me ifpandit is needed...

233
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,800
No it's ok... if needed...

234
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,600
Pappu should stay in a museum...

235
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,560
His interest is over so
will tell like this...

236
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,120
Tony, when is your next
appointment with doctor...

237
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,640
Last month I visited to Doctor...

238
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,440
Next appointment is after 3 months...

239
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,200
What do you think... I'll relax...

240
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
I thought nothing...

241
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Shifting has a stress...

242
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Yes, stress can be...

243
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,040
Maybe it's my illusion...

244
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,600
I will be more happy if it's
really your illusion...

245
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,480
I'll be not here...

246
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
You will be alone...

247
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,400
I'm having tension...

248
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,200
You don't think so much...

249
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Nothing will happen...

250
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,320
If anything happen, I won't be
able to return immediately...

251
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,640
You're just tensioning...

252
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,840
Why you left the job?

253
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,800
To engage somewhere was good for you...

254
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
What do you think?

255
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,640
Every problem can be forgot by work...

256
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,920
Every pain can be forgot...

257
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Did I forget Babui?

258
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,360
Please don't think of these...

259
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,600
Listen two old tenant
live next to our flat...

260
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Should I talk wit them?

261
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,960
Go... what is to ask here?

262
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,880
You stay alone... will get company then...

263
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,280
Oh God ...made a mistake...

264
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,520
I forgot the adaptor in office...

265
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,080
Tomorrow you are going in tour
and you forgot the adaptor...

266
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,200
Kaushik is there in tour...
so won't be problem...

267
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,440
But I need to do online transfer now...
not possible from mobile...

268
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,240
What will you do?

269
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
Where is your laptop?

270
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
In the second shelf...

271
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,160
You are careless...

272
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,680
Where is our marriage photos?

273
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,040
Tomorrow I'm leaving, can't search now...

274
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,440
After returning, I'll search...

275
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,280
You are really...

276
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Tell the password...

277
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,360
I couldn't make anything in the morning...

278
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,880
Have something after
reaching the airport...

279
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,080
Don't stay in empty stomach...

280
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
And as usual you forgot your medicine...

281
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,640
Buy it...

282
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,600
And listen, call after reaching Delhi...

283
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Take this...

284
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,880
Didn't give newspaper today...

285
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,920
That boy had an accident...
won't come two days...

286
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,240
Everything is ok in your flat?

287
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
What do you mean?

288
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,760
If any problem... please tell...

289
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,560
Aunty, I'm new in your next flat...

290
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,720
Your milk packets were here...

291
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
so I thought...

292
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,880
Are you free now?

293
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,160
Come to my flat...

294
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,240
Yes... coming...

295
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,640
When you came in the morning...

296
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,160
I was giving breakfast to your uncle...

297
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,760
So, couldn't talk to you...

298
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,640
You don't hesitate so much...
it's normal...

299
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,680
Your flat is very well decorated...

300
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,560
My son decorated all these...

301
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,200
Your uncle clean all those...

302
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,040
I don't able to do...

303
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,920
Actually I like guests...

304
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,280
I like to talk but...

305
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,080
Now a days, nobody talks much...

306
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,680
They like to stay alone...

307
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,400
Busy with mobiles...

308
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,040
Nobody talks with each other...

309
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Right...

310
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
My mom says too...

311
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,880
We're old fashioned...

312
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,680
We don't understand so much...
had never seen before...

313
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,840
People don't have that mind...

314
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,560
Aunty, how many years have you been here...

315
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,120
How many days...

316
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
How many days?

317
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,280
Yes, many years...

318
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,880
We lived on Kasba...

319
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,160
We had our home there...

320
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,160
It's my son's flat...

321
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,920
He lives abroad...

322
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,080
He don't want to put on rent...

323
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,440
So told us to stay here...

324
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,520
You sit... I'm coming...

325
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,720
Auty, I was saying that..

326
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,600
Where is uncle?

327
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:16,960
Yes, he is inside...

328
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,840
Should call him?

329
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
NO it's ok...

330
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Aunty, I'm leaving now...

331
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,280
What happen? wait... have some sweets...

332
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,400
I don't eat sweets...

333
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,520
First time you came... have at least one...

334
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,600
It was not needed aunty...

335
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,880
Have one sweet...

336
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
Aunty...

337
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,080
Your next flat where we are staying now...

338
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,080
who used to stay there before us...

339
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,800
The water fell...

340
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,200
Give it to me...

341
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
I don't know anything...

342
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,240
I don't know...

343
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,200
I don't know anything...

344
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,720
Bye aunty...

345
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,560
Why you told that you
don't know anything...

346
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,480
You could have told the truth...

347
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,960
From now onwards Rono will look after
the acounts of Anix corporation?

348
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,560
Notification says that...

349
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,720
It was under me... I should
have informed before...

350
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,880
Everyone's portfolio is changing...

351
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,240
We know the condition of last quater...

352
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,680
Missed 32% target...

353
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Yes, I know...

354
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,640
But everything has a procedure...

355
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,720
You didn't discuss with me once...

356
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,440
You've been working for two years...

357
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,080
We work like this...

358
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,680
Sit... sit...

359
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,880
Achieve your target, have
biriyani and enjoy...

360
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,320
This deal would have been closed...

361
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,200
I would have closed, if pricing
aproval would have given to me...

362
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,480
Repeatedly special pricing
approval cannot be given, Arko...

363
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
You understand this...

364
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Yes I understand this...

365
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,040
Special price approval needs special
expertise, which I don't have...

366
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,800
But you would do well by
giving the approval...

367
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,000
72 share will loss...

368
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,280
Will the board let you go...

369
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,160
Pricing order had released...

370
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,440
Approval was almost done...

371
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,120
But suddenly you came in-between...

372
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
One minute...

373
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,160
They know me... not Rono...

374
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,320
If I say everything...
will anyone believe...

375
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
None will...

376
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,160
Did you say your parents?

377
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,360
It's not possible to say them...

378
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,760
Already so many problems...

379
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
Again if...

380
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,800
What Arka is saying?

381
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,480
Did you tell him anything?

382
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,160
I told him but he ignored...

383
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,240
You make him understand
then definately he will...

384
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Listen...

385
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
Tell...

386
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,160
I'm calling you later...

387
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
Coming...

388
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,600
call you later...

389
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
I can't wait for so long...

390
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,160
Keep a bag outside... everyone
use to do like this...

391
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Ok...

392
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,440
I asked for 500 ruppees in advance...
what about it...

393
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,440
500 ruppees for what?

394
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,160
Residents leave flat suddenly
without paying dues...

395
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,640
Who lived here before you
has a due of Rs.776...

396
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,680
Ok, tomorrow you come and take...

397
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
Ok...

398
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,480
Listen, you are giving milk
here for many years...

399
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
Yes...

400
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,400
Those who lived here before us...

401
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,120
Go and ask to the security about that...
not me...

402
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,160
You stop watching those horror movies...

403
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,000
For those you lost your mind...

404
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
Everyone watches...

405
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
You also watch...

406
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
No I don't watch...

407
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,000
You get fear but watch too...

408
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
So what?

409
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,400
Did your medical problem relax again

410
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
I think no...

411
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,720
If... then I would have understood...

412
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,560
have you opened that room...

413
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
No...

414
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,600
Couldn't break the lock...

415
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,240
Then...

416
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,760
Where is Arka?

417
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,040
In his office tour...

418
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,840
Will return..

419
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,000
What is his opinion?

420
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
Opinion...

421
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,160
He is telling same as you...

422
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,880
Asking to consult the doctor...

423
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,960
Everyone will say this...

424
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
What?

425
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
What are you saying?

426
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Ok, leave it...

427
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:56,480
If really it's a paranormal or
supernatural thing... then...

428
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,400
I mean... it's need to know...

429
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,120
Who will know that... You...

430
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,520
Me... are you mad...

431
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,480
I woud have run away before...

432
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,960
It's you so still staying there...

433
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
What happened?

434
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Don't think so much...

435
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,240
Not good...

436
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,200
Signs are not good...

437
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,720
So much sin...

438
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,360
So much sin can be tolerate?

439
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,040
So injustice...

440
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,360
Sin can't be covered...

441
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,360
What are you talking about?

442
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
You don't get afraid...

443
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,760
What you are seeing...

444
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,880
may not be true...

445
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,440
May be he wants to say you something...

446
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:12,600
He wants to make you understand
something which you are not getting...

447
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:25,760
Think a little... have you seen someone...

448
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,880
I can't see clearly...
but I have also seen...

449
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,560
I know everything...

450
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,600
But I won't say anything...

451
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,360
You don't listen to her...

452
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Why not she?

453
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,480
Why she won't listen to me?

454
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,920
I can't say anything?

455
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,000
Why can't I?

456
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
You listen...

457
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,360
Sometime she gets upset...

458
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,400
You come to sleep... come...

459
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Come...

460
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,200
Sin can't be covered...

461
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,240
You bring Tony to yourself...

462
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,680
Asked her many times... she didn't agree...

463
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,960
It's sound like the ghost
stories of childhood...

464
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,200
It's not possible...

465
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,680
Have you consulted a doctor for Tony...

466
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,200
We can't force her to visit a doctor...

467
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,840
And her husband is there to look after...

468
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,080
I doubt on his sense of responsibility...

469
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,240
Don't say like this...

470
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,840
They did what they think good...

471
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,800
I think it's a pshycological case...

472
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:16,320
Ok, as you are saying... I
will threaten the broker...

473
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,040
Ok ...don't do anything extreme...

474
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,480
Actually they are all under
the shelter of politicians...

475
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,880
So you can't do anything extreme...

476
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,520
You don't worry... I'll
find out the truth...

477
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,680
I told you, let me return
then I will see the matter...

478
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,040
Why you informed your father then?

479
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,080
He is my father... so get tensed...

480
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,680
Yes I know... for that I
have to suffer also...

481
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,160
Ok, now you calm down...

482
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,440
I will return tomorrow night...

483
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,240
At present situation, its difficult
to pass a night peacefully...

484
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,680
Nothing happened... and
nothing will happen...

485
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
Yes I'm telling...

486
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,760
You do one thing... you relax...

487
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Try to sleep...

488
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Ok...

489
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,480
Tomorrow I'm returning to you...

490
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,280
Return carefully...

491
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,320
Uncle, do you have five minutes...

492
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,840
That is my daughters flat...

493
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,720
In fact, so much scandal has spread...

494
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,840
I didn't want to put that flat on rent...

495
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,080
But that brocker nagged so much...

496
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,480
His name is Pappu...

497
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,040
What exactly happened in that flat...

498
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,520
Please tell...

499
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:07,480
My daughter, son-in-law and my only
grandson Pupai used to stay in that flat...

500
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,680
I feel ashamed of telling...

501
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,160
My son-in-law was not good...

502
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,480
Firstly, he was an alcoholic...

503
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,120
Then he started mental
torture on my daughter...

504
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,080
Still now I remember that night...

505
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,960
For a long time there
had been a fighting...

506
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,040
After that total silence...

507
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,160
Then...

508
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,640
Next day...

509
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,760
My daughter's dead body was
rescued by the police...

510
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,720
And Pupu?

511
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,960
He was not found for the first two days...

512
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:23,920
Then while searching Police found his
body in the closet of the upper room...

513
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,480
This world is strange...

514
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,240
You know...

515
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,280
Some don't get children even
after continous praying...

516
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,800
And some throw, even after getting...

517
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,240
If you can't take responsibility, then...

518
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,480
Bye...

519
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,880
Be careful...

520
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,040
We are with you all the time...

521
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,400
Call us if needed...

522
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,520
You don't do so much tension...

523
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,360
Arka is returning at night...

524
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,240
I had my dinner, mom...

525
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
You sleep...

526
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,160
If I don't wake up, he has the key...

527
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,960
Talk to you tomorrow...

528
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,880
Feeling tired...

529
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,160
Bye...

530
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,080
When you came?

531
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,240
Flight was in time?

532
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,040
Have you eaten the food...

533
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,280
I didn't keep much food as you
have eaten on the flight...

534
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,400
Tony, get up and open the door...
I forgot to take the key...

535
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,440
I'm giving the door bell so long...
please...

536
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,600
Tony, I'm standing outside... hello Tony...

537
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,480
I don't understand, why you
are not believing this...

538
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,720
This is not a matter of
belief and disbelief...

539
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,760
Then what?

540
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,080
I just want to say that...

541
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,520
Can't we afford a little more time...

542
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,920
I can't tolerate anymore... Arka...

543
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,680
You are forcing...

544
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,680
I'm not forcing you...

545
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
Then what are you doing?

546
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,400
What?

547
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,640
May be you are

548
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,560
We are going to make a councelling...

549
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,560
What do you mean?

550
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,800
What?

551
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,400
Am I mad?

552
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,320
I have not understood...

553
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,320
You sit here...

554
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,800
Please...

555
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,880
I can't endure any more...

556
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,800
I thought all will be well after marriage

557
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,840
If the God disposes that also

558
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,240
This is a temporary fase...

559
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,800
All will be well...

560
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,120
Everything will not be well...

561
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,640
I won't be mother again...

562
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,160
Our son won't come back

563
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,000
He just came and went away forever

564
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,920
You didn't see him

565
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,000
How cute he was

566
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,200
Our son passed away and...

567
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,280
His father also didn't understand me

568
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,280
I thought after getting you

569
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,760
Everything will be well

570
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,600
everything will be well

571
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,120
If that won't be happened...

572
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,120
We will not talk about this...

573
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,320
Okay...

574
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,400
Today, I have off my work for you only

575
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,840
But you will go tomorrow...

576
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,040
That is my profession...

577
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,280
Just tell me where the
owner of the flat stays

578
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,520
Sir, I mean...

579
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,160
If I know that... I mean he lives in U.S.A

580
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,720
We talked over phone

581
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,520
Give me his phone number

582
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,920
I have changed my phone, that's why...

583
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,400
Do you always tell lies?

584
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,160
No, I mean...

585
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,360
I will just smash you...

586
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,640
I will put you behind the bar...
hey, Pritam...

587
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,120
Sir, I beg you pardon

588
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,560
Just, you look, my phone is new...

589
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,920
Old numbers have been deleted...
Listen to me...

590
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,120
You will give me the phone
number within 24 hrs.

591
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,280
Now, get lost...

592
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,160
What happened?

593
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,280
One little thing Sir... private...

594
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,240
Your papers are ready

595
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,440
You will give us your photograph

596
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,920
And what about our locker...

597
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,360
That has been done previously...

598
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,520
And rest will be done soon

599
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,360
Hey, Tony...

600
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,840
AC temperature is vey much low, make
it high... remote is by your side...

601
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,880
I have not done anything

602
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,760
It is feelling cold

603
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,800
It was not drawn earlier...

604
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,920
Tony, what happened to you?

605
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,000
It's me... what happened?

606
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,160
Sir, here is the file

607
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,600
Sir, I have to tell you something

608
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,120
There is a strange thing

609
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,320
I mean... about an incident

610
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,320
It was about my friend's daughter

611
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,680
Generaly, it is a very normal thing

612
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:45,680
But investigettin the matter, a
strange point has come to me...

613
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:51,840
If you listen that, may
be it will be a help...

614
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,440
It was happened in 2002

615
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,920
Relax, everything will be alright...

616
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,160
I am returning back day after tomorrow,
and will find a new flat... okay...

617
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,600
I have told Pappu and security guard also

618
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,320
If you feel anything wrong, just phone them

619
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,760
And to me also... okay...

620
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,800
And there is another thing to say...

621
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,560
The bill of previous tenant

622
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,720
Which has come some days ago...
Yes...

623
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:12,760
Which has come some days ago...
Yes...
That has to be sent them, I have got the
phone number, I am giving to you... bye

624
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,680
That has to be sent them, I have got the
phone number, I am giving to you... bye

625
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,720
Okay

626
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,920
Now what?

627
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,760
Brother...

628
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,520
Whom do you want?

629
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,040
A friend of my husband informed
about this flat ...okay...

630
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,840
That time I told him many time that...

631
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,760
Why will we come to a rented flat,
when we have our own already

632
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,520
That's true

633
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,320
But as usual, he didn't listened to me

634
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,400
Actually, I can't blame Anirban also...

635
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,960
Because that flat is
very near to his office

636
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,280
Look, I don't know whether
it is ghost or not...

637
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,200
But we always felt the
existence of another one

638
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,240
Well, I mean...

639
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,760
If you please tell me about the feeling

640
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,880
At first, utensils were fallen...

641
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,160
Then switched off the
light autometically...

642
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,520
At first I got those very natural

643
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,680
But when Boon...

644
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:07,560
I mean my son, who will be
age of 7 years very soon...

645
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,760
Suddenly he watched an unknown boy there

646
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,360
He told that he will play with that boy

647
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:21,000
He told me that the boy
is standing by him...

648
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,880
Hearing this, we felt very anxious...

649
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,120
Then we left the flat

650
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,920
Perhaps, some guests are in you flat

651
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,720
Anyway, I saw a boy is
standing on the window

652
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,880
Tell him not to do so

653
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,840
Otherwise I will be in trouble

654
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,840
Bye...

655
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,240
Hello, anybody here?

656
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,360
Hello, anybody here?

657
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,960
Anybody?

658
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,080
My God...

659
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,160
It's a blunder

660
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,640
It is a 10 years old photograph

661
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,800
And then also a face with beard

662
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,240
Me also shall be looked
like this if I make up

663
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,960
A better one can't be found?

664
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,280
No Sir, this is the only one...

665
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:17,040
Okay... you do one thing,
go to our graphic designer

666
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,320
What is his name...

667
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,880
Chitta... yes, Chitta...

668
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,760
Ask him to make an image without beard...

669
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,600
Will it be anything different?

670
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,760
Then also, we can guess then...

671
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:32,960
Have you seen?

672
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,720
Pupu drew very well

673
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
Mountain

674
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,720
Birds

675
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,800
This one

676
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:49,280
He showed me after
completing these drawings...

677
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,880
He was with his parent

678
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,720
He must show me

679
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,800
No more...

680
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:16,320
But, I didn't see this picture

681
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,680
Who are they?

682
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:32,760
These are new paintings

683
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,920
When have you got those?

684
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,040
Yesterday

685
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,960
But there is nothing written
which you have told...

686
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,160
I also didn't see from the morning

687
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:57,480
I am not feeling well

688
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:22,680
Pupu is in this room

689
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,440
What do you want to say?

690
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,880
What?

691
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,120
I won't tell anyone...

692
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,600
Tell...

693
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,840
I won't tell anything

694
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,840
Tell me...

695
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,160
Tony...

696
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,640
Tony...

697
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,760
Tony, are you in the room?

698
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,920
Tony, I have rang the bell, but
why didn't you open the door?

699
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,680
Why are you sitting here?

700
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,600
Tony...

701
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,520
What happened?

702
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,120
What happened to you?

703
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,120
Why are you doing so?

704
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,800
I know everything

705
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,440
Tony, we will discuss about this...

706
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,880
Can you tell me, why does the baby do so?

707
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,560
Why does he do so?

708
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,760
I know that...

709
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,240
I know that...

710
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,360
I know...

711
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,240
Hello, Dr. Das?

712
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:25,840
I am Arko calling

713
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,480
I am bringing Tony to your chamber

714
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,880
Just look at this

715
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,920
What I suspect

716
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,480
Now sedative is on...

717
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,880
Let her sleep for sometime

718
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,680
better you to go home

719
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,200
You see her in the evening

720
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,560
I have some queries

721
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,160
Okay, come inside

722
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,560
Look at this Sir...

723
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:04,920
This is not a current issue

724
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:06,320
It is a very old case

725
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:07,680
It was started from 2002

726
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,520
Here are some incidents

727
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,240
Everyone is linked

728
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,440
We have shifted in a new flat

729
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,080
Sayantani was telling that...

730
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,000
Abnormal or paranormal?

731
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,200
Well, Tony is telling so...

732
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,080
In this type of case, psychological
stress... Doctor...

733
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,840
I didn't stress her by any means...

734
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,280
In fact, I asked her to come
to you and counsel herself

735
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,840
Anyway, now it is useless

736
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,160
Let her be under sedation...

737
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,560
under supervision...

738
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,920
Then we will decide what to do...

739
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,560
Then also, how long it will take to cure?

740
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,560
That's can't be told exactly, because
this kind of patient is unpredictable

741
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,800
May it be One month or Six months...

742
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,200
Sir, your assumption was right...

743
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,880
The face is same without the beard

744
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,120
With a musk of good citizen,

745
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,680
he is doing fraudulent
activities, year after years

746
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,520
And we are not able to catch him...

747
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,200
In 2002, his name was Anirban Lahiri...

748
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,640
he cheated a widow residing at Durgapur...

749
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,880
In 2009, place was Siliguri,
now his name was Mainak Chanda

750
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,120
In this time his victim was a teenage model

751
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,280
Her father was a billionaire...
Very good...

752
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,520
He married him for two months...

753
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,960
Her father fixed it with
a good amount of money

754
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,160
To rescue his daughter...

755
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,000
A mechanical Engineer, an
employee of a good company...

756
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,280
Then why he use to do this...

757
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,160
They are pshycologicaly totally different..

758
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,240
Maintain a high social status...

759
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,200
Can't make friendship
with general people...

760
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,800
May be disturbed for any
childhood reason...

761
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:53,680
He is also alike...

762
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,880
Grown up in uncle's house...

763
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,960
Father commited suicide as his
mother left his father...

764
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,840
Yes Amlan tell...

765
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,200
What?

766
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,120
Ok...

767
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,880
I will see...

768
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,200
What happened sir?

769
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,920
You should knock before entering...

770
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:28,960
I got afraid...

771
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,040
What you fear so much?

772
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:32,560
Get caught...

773
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,640
Don't talk rubbish...

774
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,520
What's the situation there?

775
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,160
Well there...

776
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,080
My story ended there...

777
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,800
Listen, today will do the fund transfer...

778
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:45,640
No need to delay...

779
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,960
Did you do the account setup?

780
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,720
I don't keep these works pending...

781
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,680
Well, did anyone see you coming here...

782
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,200
If saw then what...

783
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,200
Officially, I have not done any crime...

784
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,240
No records till today...

785
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,000
Police didn't get any
trace of you till now...

786
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,400
No trace left to catch...

787
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,880
Tell me one thing...

788
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,880
Did anything really happen in that flat...

789
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:10,960
I don't belief...

790
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,640
But Pappu told me before that
there is a strong rumour...

791
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,440
People over there believe that...

792
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:21,400
And in that situation if Tony starts
enquiring from others about the fact...

793
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,000
Then her stress will increase...

794
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,960
Then the maid will deny to
come at night out of fear...

795
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,680
Suddenly, the lift will stop...

796
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,600
Every time Pappu was there to support...

797
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,360
I also didn't imagine of so quick impact...

798
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:34,720
Well...

799
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,760
Didn't have to deal much... all smooth...

800
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,800
Matter of crores... you understand that...

801
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,560
Everything is within it...

802
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,120
Without princess... the
whole kingdom is ours...

803
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,440
Bye...

804
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,400
I'm taking the bike,
leaving the car here...

805
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,720
You told to stay aware...

806
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,640
Yes Sir, he is out...

807
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,360
I think he understood...

808
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:34,400
Playing with us...

809
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,760
Let him play... and you also play...

810
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:55,560
Ask the next traffic squad
to block the bike...

811
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,600
Can I know my fault?

812
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,480
I wanted to call you...

813
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,400
But you rided so first that...

814
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,200
You got scared by seeing them?

815
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,520
Anyone will scare seeing the police...

816
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,160
Who wish to be in trouble?

817
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,360
Want to say something?

818
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:47,000
I have two questions to you...

819
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,840
First question has three parts...

820
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:58,320
Where were you on 15th july of 2005, 3rd
march of 2008 and 5th september of 2011...

821
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:10,000
It's not possible to remember
for a normal human being...

822
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,880
Do you exactly remember, what
you did on those days...

823
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,440
Then moving to my second question...

824
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,520
Look at this photo... can
you recognize him...

825
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,800
He is my replica...

826
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,480
Criminal or what?

827
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,720
Be careful...

828
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,160
I will Sir, thank you...

829
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:38,560
Can I ask you onething?

830
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,800
Hmm... sure...

831
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:45,160
Why you made such a scene
on road with bike, car...

832
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,960
You could have call me on police station...

833
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,240
Yes I could...

834
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:58,480
Would that have good, if they put you
behind the cell and have beaten you...

835
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,640
After all you are a good citizen...

836
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,080
I also have some moral duties...

837
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:07,640
Let him go...

838
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,320
I need to talk to you...

839
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,600
Did your daughter complain against me?

840
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:38,640
No not that, but the whole matter
seems very strange to me...

841
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,280
A complete fit girl...

842
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,560
Complete fit...

843
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,320
It didn't happen before?

844
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,320
You want to say that
bi-polar is not a disease...

845
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,360
No, it's not a disease...

846
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,480
Many have this problem...

847
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,640
Who created this situation?

848
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:03,680
I did...

849
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,880
I imported a ghost in this flat...

850
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:06,920
Happy...

851
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,120
Listen, it's already too late...

852
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,080
Your daughter is not here,
so I have to cook...

853
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,760
Will you have your dinner here?

854
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,560
Look madam, we know everything...

855
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,760
So we are not willing to
disturb you unnecessary...

856
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,160
So why you called me
here without any reason?

857
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,160
Not without reason...

858
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,320
There is a reason...

859
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,120
Your death is on both side...

860
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,400
This side he and the other side me...

861
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,480
Now the question is what
type of death do you want?

862
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,520
Slowly or...

863
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,560
You are threatening me...

864
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,280
You will get one...

865
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,080
Then the whole world will
see your actual face...

866
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,080
Then you will become a celebrity...

867
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,640
Sir, Jayanta informed that
the boy went to an ATM...

868
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:28,920
And there he had a problem...

869
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,240
But now he returned home...

870
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,680
You keep on watching that side...

871
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,960
Ok, you call the force...

872
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,200
Two will be enough and also
take the S.I with you...

873
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,480
I'm going to the control room...

874
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,720
So much insecurity that you
brought the gun with you...

875
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,560
Sir, look at monitor 1...

876
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,840
why you created this
suspense unnecessarily...

877
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:42,960
Did your pressure increase...

878
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:44,840
Don't waste time...

879
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,040
Why you opened my bank account?

880
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,640
None knows the information except you...

881
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,360
Your bank account?

882
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,080
When it became your?

883
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,680
I was calling you... why
didn't you receive?

884
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,000
Police caught me...

885
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,400
Imprisoned me for two hours...

886
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,360
Annanya, you arre my accomplish...

887
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,960
I didn't expect such a
bad story from you...

888
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:09,960
Bad story?

889
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,320
Good about your luck that
I didn't say anything...

890
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:15,480
What do you say?

891
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,760
Then you had to say from the begining...

892
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:19,960
You introduced me with Sayantani...

893
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,120
That means, you want to be good now...

894
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,720
So you don't want profit share...

895
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,720
The whole money is mine...

896
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,720
I don't want to talk...

897
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,360
Just want to know, where is the money...

898
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,160
Asking you for the last
time, where is the money...

899
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,360
Again another bad story...

900
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:01,200
The whole room is under
cctv surveillance...

901
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,120
Everywhere camera fitted...

902
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,760
What are you doing?

903
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,920
Annanya leave... Annanya you are...

904
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:25,400
She didn't take the money...

905
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,000
Why you shoot her?

906
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,800
You... you...

907
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,320
How you did such a big drama of love?

908
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,240
Have you never loved anyone in your life?

909
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:57,160
Arka Mukherjee... a very
cool headed criminal...

910
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,400
Always targeted lonely girls...

911
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,840
Do a good job...

912
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,520
Naturally, no one suspected him...

913
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,440
In last ten years made
three such incidents...

914
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:25,280
My daughter didn't give me any
scope to check his background...

915
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,640
Before that...
No..no...

916
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,800
She has no fault...

917
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,480
Police got confused too...

918
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,760
After five years again he re-appeared

919
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,720
This time his target was Sayantani...

920
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,640
Who can be mold easily...

921
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,960
Easily trapped with love...

922
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,520
As usual no court marriage done...

923
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,880
Married in temple which
have no legal validity...

924
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:05,080
He ruined the wedding pictures...

925
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,320
Where are our wedding pictures?

926
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,760
Tomorrow I'm leaving, can't search now...

927
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,720
Hacked my banking information
from my laptop...

928
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,320
Tell me your password...

929
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,240
I didn't understand anything at first...

930
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,360
It didn't even come to my mind...

931
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
It's natural...

932
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:29,680
And after that joint
account in bank, locker...

933
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,720
Have to open the bank account
after returnig... it's urgent...

934
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,280
Why you need to open a new account...

935
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:37,000
I have my account... join with it...

936
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:41,360
When you started doubting him?

937
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,920
You didn't know about the ghost?

938
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,600
Your husband knew everything...

939
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,160
He didn't say you anything?

940
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,000
After uncle told me...

941
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,400
I started enquiring everywhere...

942
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,160
Went to his office to do enquiry...

943
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,360
Went to old tenant's house...

944
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,800
Then met with you at lalbazar...

945
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,600
Everthing becomes clear to me...

946
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,240
Very clever...

947
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:19,200
He managed Pappu to get that flat...

948
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,280
And according to Pappu...

949
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:24,080
I told Mr.Arka, that flat is haunted...

950
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,640
He told that he wants that...

951
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,520
Told that, will pay more, so I...

952
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,120
What would I do if he want?

953
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:32,800
One depressed lady...

954
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:38,080
It's easy to stress her by
showing fear of ghost...

955
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:42,160
And if Sayantani is proved mad...

956
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,360
Then nobody will doubt on Arka...

957
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,560
I started acting...

958
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,040
Arka was fooled by that...

959
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,680
Doctor uncle helped a lot...

960
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,200
The drama of admitting in hospital...

961
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,160
confused Arka more...

962
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:05,200
someone was warning me from the begining...

963
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,720
Was giving me clue one after another...

964
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,200
Pictures of old victims...

965
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:15,360
Sketch of Arka...

966
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,360
Forged flight tickets of Arka's tour...

967
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,360
Repeatedly pointing towards Arka...

968
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:23,840
Telling me to run away...

969
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,960
One was giving all types of signals...

970
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,160
Who is that?

971
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:35,720
Let it go...

972
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:47,400
Many things exist in this world
which has no explanation...

973
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:56,360
But that doesn't mean, it is not true

974
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,440
Bye Ani...

975
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,200
Let's go...

976
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:24,560
Where will I go...

977
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,560
I have no home...

978
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,120
Will you drop me...

979
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,960
Uncle...

980
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:09,360
You... you were...

981
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:12,480
I will tell everything uncle...

982
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,640
But why you are still awake?

983
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,720
I felt asleep...

984
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:24,080
Suddenly I awoke with a bad dream...

985
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,160
What dream?

986
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:35,600
I saw Pupu, sitting on his
mother lap on varandah...

987
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:43,040
I wanted to call... then..

988
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:46,960
Then...

989
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:56,160
No... I will tell you later...

990
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,560
Youn go and take rest...

991
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:03,360
I have a good news...

992
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:11,400
After a long time, your aunty fell
asleep without sleeping pills...

993
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:19,160
Good... very good...

994
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:21,680
You too sleep...

995
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:08,120
Some words remain unsaid...

996
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:17,120
To stare with lonely eyes...

997
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:26,040
Kept to tell you...

998
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:34,840
Memories comes in form of stories...

999
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:45,480
My story starts and ends with you...

1000
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:54,240
Only you can make me flooded...

1001
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:08,160
Kept to tell you...

1002
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:17,800
Memories comes in form of stories...

1003
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:26,800
Kept only to tell you...

1004
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:36,360
Memories comes in form of stories...
