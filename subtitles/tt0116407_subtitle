1
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
we're told that names of your party
members figure in the Jain diaries.

2
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,900
So what's new?

3
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Let the other diary be opened...
and see the names popping out.

4
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,000
what?! Are we going to have
another scandalous diary?

5
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,700
lt's not the diary. lt's politics;
Politicians have all been exposed.

6
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,000
All politicians will be imprisoned
now for the bribes they've taken.

7
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,700
Then what are we to do about it?

8
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,300
Let's form a Corporation;
Everybody else is doing it, too.

9
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,200
That will even help your unaccounted
money be effectively invested.

10
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,500
Let's make movies and TV-serials...
we can always find good stories.

11
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,300
Never mind that... Let's wrap up
this story first, Godbole.

12
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,000
l'm prepared, Sir... l'm only
waiting for the violence to begin.

13
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:42,000
we will not given in...
we will have our land!

14
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,700
- what is your name?
- Sachdev...

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,500
l've met you 1 3 times
in the last 3 months!

16
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
And you have asked me my name
each of those times!

17
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,800
You always managed to remember my
name during your election campaigns.

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,100
You have forgotten everything now...
including our problems!

19
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,400
l remember your problem. You want
possession of a land somewhere that...

20
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,300
Not a land ''somewhere'' , Mr. Patel...
l'm only talking of Gol Chowk!

21
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,600
The place where we have earned our
livelihood for the last 1 0 years.

22
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,800
lt feeds no less than a hundred
and fifty families!

23
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,700
And what was the place earlier?

24
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,600
Dumping ground of the city's refuse!
where snakes and scorpions bred!

25
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,700
People were even scared
to venture out there.

26
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,800
we have toiled to give it the
respectability of a marketplace.

27
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,700
we have ourselves cleaned the
place of the dirt and refuse!

28
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,000
- He's right!
- And now...

29
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
...we're being uprooted from there
and driven out!

30
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,600
Only because Katiya can make a
huge shopping-complex there?!

31
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,900
why can't you understand
the problem?

32
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,000
The Government will have do make
inquiries. So what's wrong?

33
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,400
And what do you wish to
inquire about?!

34
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,400
lf you're really so keen...

35
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,500
...go and take a look in our homes;
we haven't cooked for days!

36
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,400
we survive on our daily-earnings,
Mr. Patel.

37
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,200
And our shops have been closed
for 20 days now!

38
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,300
Katiya's thugs flex their
muscles in broad-daylight...

39
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,700
...making it difficult for our kids
and womenfolk to move about freely!

40
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,800
Had we helped you win the elections
and voted you to power...

41
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,300
...only to face the police's caning,
without even being heard?

42
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,900
Do you want us to remain silent
when your people pelt stones...

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,900
lt was your goons, and not our people
who pelted the stones! Understand?!

44
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,000
Now wait... calm down!

45
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,500
They're all with Katiya!

46
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,300
They have a share in the shopping
mall Katiya will build there!

47
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,800
- Come to your senses...
- lt's you...

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,200
...who has to be brought
to your senses, lnspector!

49
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,700
Listen carefully, Mr. Patel...

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,600
we have our roots
deep in that place.

51
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,400
You just can't evict us
from Gol Chowk!

52
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,300
ln your very presence, we shall
go on a hunger-strike...

53
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,200
...with our wives and children.

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,800
lf death is what we're destined to
get, we will choose how we die!

55
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,100
The rest is for the
Lord to decide.

56
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,200
we have a problem indeed.
we must meet Katiya soon.

57
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,900
who the hell is Katiya
to decide our destiny?

58
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,700
we own the shops, the land,...
and slog on them!

59
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,700
Then why must we
grovel before anyone?

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,500
where's the question of groveling?
You simply don't understand this!

61
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,300
l suggest we settle this without
a fight, if that's possible.

62
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,000
lt's because of your attitude
that we've reached this stage!

63
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,100
when Katiya's brother first came
here to collect protection money...

64
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,600
...l was against it even then!

65
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,300
l had strongly advised them
against paying up.

66
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,000
But they said then, that it was
a question of only two Rupees...

67
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,000
...and it was better
to settle it peacefully.

68
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,000
But it wasn't just
a question of 2 Rupees.

69
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,100
lt had to do with acknowledging
Katiya's authority!

70
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,200
we were bowing to his might...and
that is what eventually happened!

71
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,400
Their demands for money continued
to increase. So much so...

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,900
...that he now wants to uproot us
from our dwellings!

73
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,700
But, do you think a hunger-strike
will serve the purpose?

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,300
we're not political leaders...

75
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,900
...who'll be offered lime-juice
to end the agitation.

76
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,400
- He's right!
- we'll only rot here...

77
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,100
- ...and eventually die.
- So, go ahead and die!

78
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,900
we must prove to them that
we are prepared to die!

79
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,200
That they cannot scare us with
threats of impending death!

80
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,600
we will not vacate this place,
come what may!

81
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,700
l think we must..

82
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,400
That's a special ''soldier''
from Katiya's force.

83
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
Stopping getting scared... it's here
only to escort us to Katiya.

84
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,500
The man's fond of many such things.
How can l tell you of everything?

85
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,900
This way... there's a special
program underway in there.

86
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,700
lls it a cabaret? Or is it
a notch-girl's dance?

87
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,700
You're lucky, the soldier didn't
hear that. Or he'd have mauled you.

88
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,100
The fights and thrills of movies
and videos just don't excite Katiya.

89
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,500
Then what does?

90
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,600
He gets a kick out of seeing death...
from handing it out to a live person!

91
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,000
He sets man against man;
animal against animal...

92
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,700
And sometimes, an animal
against man, too!

93
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,100
He gets a kick out of
seeing blood being shed.

94
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,200
He rewards those who
emerge victorious...

95
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
...and enrolls them in his gang.

96
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,700
what about the ones
who lose?

97
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,400
This thug of yours has
lost to me, Katiya!

98
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Do you still have someone
strong enough to challenge me?

99
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,600
Hold it!

100
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,600
Haven't l often told you...

101
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,100
...not to use these
weapons of the cowards...

102
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,500
...to call yourself lion-hearted.

103
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,200
Have you seen for yourself
the might of my brothers?

104
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,300
They're lions... all my
six brothers are lions!

105
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,700
You have dared to challenge me
in my den and lose a duel.

106
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,900
Have him thrown in
the panther's cage.

107
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
As for you...

108
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,800
You have surrendered to the enemy
inspite of being my own man.

109
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,100
You have considered your life to be
more precious than my honor.

110
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,100
And l have no use for
such a meaningless life.

111
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,800
lt'd be terribly difficult, should
they really go on a hunger-strike.

112
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,800
They've always stayed
there, Mr. Katiya.

113
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,100
But if l am pressurized any further,
l'll be helpless, too.

114
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,800
we have used threats
and intimidation...

115
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,600
...but Sachdev doesn't seem
to buckle under the pressure.

116
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
You've had a stroke of paralysis,
brother-in-law.

117
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
- what nonsense are you talking?!
- That's not nonsense! lt's true...

118
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,500
The Law and the politicians have
always been his strong-arms.

119
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,200
when they both refuse to work,
doesn't it mean he's paralyzed...

120
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,300
Stop him, please! what's the
rot he's wishing for?!

121
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,700
He stays with us, for one.
And then acts smart, too.

122
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,400
Had we the good sense to throw
you out when your sister died...

123
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,900
...we wouldn't have had to
put up with your nonsense!

124
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,100
l'll kick him out this very moment
and throw a party to celebrate it!

125
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,400
Brother-in-law! l won't leave
my brother-in-law alone...

126
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,500
My sister told me before she died,
to always serve my brother-in-law...

127
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,400
...and to find
my place at his feet.

128
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,000
- won't you get lost then?!
- Stop it... that's enough.

129
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,200
what did you say his name is?

130
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,700
why must you alone take
the lead in this matter?

131
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,600
what's wrong now?

132
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
we'll face the same fate
as others do.

133
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,700
why must you try
and be the leader?

134
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,400
l'm not trying to be the leader; but
someone will have to bear the mantle.

135
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
- we'll have to speak up.
- l don't like this.

136
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,900
Do you just ''don't like it''
or are you afraid for me?

137
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,300
l'm afraid, too.

138
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,900
- lf one has to live in the world...
- l'm not bothered about the world.

139
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,100
All l know is that my world
revolves around you alone.

140
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,500
And l'm always worried
about you.

141
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,200
And the Lord above
worries about everyone.

142
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,300
Don't worry... do you think He'd
spare them, should something happen?

143
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,100
He'll make them account
for their deeds.

144
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
As for me... l'm only doing
my duty, Malti.

145
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,400
Let's leave the rest
to the Almighty.

146
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,800
Hurry up and drop the stuff home;
they must've already started it.

147
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,800
And make sure to have lots
of water before you come.

148
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,200
This is no ceremonial fast;
it's a hunger-strike.

149
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,500
''we will not vacate this land''

150
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,000
''we own this land;
it belongs to us''

151
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,800
No!

152
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,900
No..! Don't!

153
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,800
No! This can't be!

154
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,600
Save him, somebody...!
He's dying!

155
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,700
Hear me! Listen to me, please!

156
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,000
lt's like this...l don't think my
medicines are working on him now.

157
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,300
But you can rush him to Mumbai
at the earliest...

158
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,400
...and admit him in some
big hospital.

159
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,900
He'll recover immediately.

160
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,700
And, fact is, your brother Shiv
stays in Mumbai too, doesn't he?

161
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,000
You've said what you have say;
let's face it!

162
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,300
But don't you know how Dad
hates modern medicine?

163
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,200
He claims to be brave; but he's
scared of a mere syringe!

164
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,000
Besides, who'd drill
the sense into him?

165
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,700
- You can do that, of course!
- l ?!

166
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,700
Not me... you can do it instead!

167
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
- lt can only be you!
- l?!

168
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,400
He's your Dad, after all... and you
look after him so well, don't you?

169
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,000
lt's settled then; talk to your Dad.
l've got to go and see a patient.

170
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,100
- That's the truth of the matter!
- Mr. Physician!

171
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,800
Now you're telling me, are you?

172
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,700
Just dressing in clean clothes
does not amount to hygiene.

173
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You have to maintain a clean
neighborhood, too.

174
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,000
lf each one of us maintains
cleanliness in our area...

175
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,900
...we'd easily have a clean city.

176
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,500
ln the cleanliness drive undertaken
by Mahatma Gandhi...

177
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,200
...l've joined him in cleaning
the filthiest of places.

178
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,300
And you folks...

179
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,400
...if you think that's
below your dignity,...

180
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,000
...l'll personally sweep
this place tomorrow.

181
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,500
- That's not necessary, Sir...
- we'll do it on our own!

182
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,800
- How about the lane, Sir?
- That lane leading to the school...

183
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,300
...must be completed
at the earliest.

184
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,800
Meet the new officer at
the Municipality.

185
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,300
You must tell him
everything about me.

186
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,000
l've taken part in the freedom
struggle with Mahatma Gandhi.

187
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,200
l've even received a letter
of acknowledgement.

188
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,700
See how quickly the work gets
done, when you use my name.

189
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,000
Did you see my father around, Radhe?
He came this way, didn't he?

190
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,200
Oh, sure. He gave us a piece
of his mind just now.

191
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,400
He's gone to repeat the act
a little farther away!

192
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,300
You rascal! You're always playing...
why don't you go to school?

193
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,100
- where's your father?
- Good-morning, Sir.

194
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,100
why doesn't your son go
to the school, Hariya?

195
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,600
l drop him at the school everyday;
but he runs away from there.

196
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,800
l'm now thinking of making him
help me out in the fields.

197
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,600
Do you want to make an animal
out of him in those fields?!

198
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,900
Don't you know that Mr. Shastri...

199
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,900
...swam across the river, with his
books on his head, to reach school?

200
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,000
And, eventually, he became the
Prime Minister of our country!

201
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,900
But why must this boy swim across
the river? His school is nearby.

202
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,500
Shut up, you idiot!

203
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,400
Now look; a man without education
is nothing short of an animal!

204
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,500
Just watch out, if your son
doesn't attend school from tomorrow!

205
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
You've been scolding me, Sir...

206
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,000
l wish you'd say something
to this boy, too.

207
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,700
Straighten up! what are you
wearing that silly grin for?!

208
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,500
The physician has
made it clear...

209
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,600
...that you'll have to
go to Bombay for your cure.

210
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,200
which physician is that?
'' Let's face it,'' eh?

211
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,700
l was the one who treated him
when he himself fell sick.

212
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,900
There's no need... l'll grind
some herbs for myself.

213
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,900
This is a question of your health,
father. lt's no social-service.

214
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,900
- God forbid, if something...
- Shut up!

215
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,800
You're getting to be
very smart, aren't you?

216
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,900
- l know why you refuse to go.
- why is that?

217
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,700
- l won't tell you.
- Go on... tell me!

218
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,900
- l won't!
- Tell me, or you get a punch!

219
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,800
- You're terrified of the syringe.
- what?!

220
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,300
Listen carefully to what l say...

221
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,700
l will, when you
set my ear free!

222
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,500
well, okay... l will not leave
my work behind and go to Bombay!

223
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,000
And if you ask me to go ever
again, l'll give you a punch!

224
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,900
Keep it up, Kashi!

225
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,300
Keep it up...
Get him...! Get him by the feet!

226
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,900
Get up, my son!

227
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
lt's a question of
my honor, mind you!

228
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,800
Bravo!

229
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,900
Keep it up! Bravo!

230
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,000
He's won!

231
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Glory to the Lord!

232
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,500
Father!

233
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,100
Sit down, father... Go on.

234
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,000
You're coughing blood, father!

235
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
Never mind... it's nothing!

236
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,900
You did a great job!
Bravo!

237
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,800
- Listen, Kashi...
- what is it?

238
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,100
where were you all day?

239
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,000
- You haven't even had your food.
- l won't have it.

240
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,000
why? Are you angry
with me?

241
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,300
- Yes, l am.
- But what's wrong?

242
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,700
l understand everything now...
l get it all!

243
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,300
You'd have left immediately for
Bombay, had Shiv asked you to.

244
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,500
Didn't you see how seriously ill
you were today? You even bled!

245
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,500
You don't listen to me because
l'm not your own son.

246
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,200
Because you found me
at the river!

247
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,800
Don't you dare say such
a thing ever again!

248
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,200
- l'll throw you in the Ganges!
- l'll swim back to the shores.

249
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,900
- l'll throw you back again!
- And l'll swim back again...

250
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,300
Or who'd look after you?
who'd give you a leg-massage?

251
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,400
And who'd listen to
your scolding?

252
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,400
That's enough! You speak any
nonsense that comes to your mind!

253
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,700
You've begun talking a lot
of nonsense, of late.

254
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,000
Very well. l'll go to Bombay.

255
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,900
But don't you dare say
such a thing again!

256
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,600
By the way, where will we
stay in Bombay?

257
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,300
- with Brother Shiv, of course!
- No way! Certainly not there!

258
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
He's an ass, of the first order!

259
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
lt's 7 years since
he's left for Bombay!

260
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,400
He's married and even has a kid...
but he just doesn't return!

261
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,700
- He's become an ass!
- Shall l go and wire him?

262
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,300
First have your food. And you
can send the cable later.

263
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,000
- l'll send the wire first...
- You must eat first!

264
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,800
- l'll send the wire first, Dad!
- Listen... Kashi!

265
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,300
This chap's become an ass, too!

266
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,400
l've heard a lot about
your bravery.

267
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,700
The nation needs honest and
courageous officers like you!

268
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,500
l'm only following
your teachings, Sir.

269
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
l pray to God for your recovery
and for your safe return.

270
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,200
l'll return soon. Actually, l wasn't
even prepared to go to Bombay.

271
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,000
lt's the physician who forced me
to go to Bombay for a cure.

272
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,000
l did that only to help you
recover quickly, Mr. Shambhu Nath.

273
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,700
- Let's face it, eh?
- That's right!

274
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,500
Let's go, Father. The train's
about to leave.

275
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,300
You idiot! Can the train
ever leave without me?!

276
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Come on, father...

277
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,100
Very well then, gentlemen...
Glory to the Lord!

278
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,000
wait, Kashi...
l've dropped my cap!

279
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,600
lt's okay... l've found it.

280
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
The holy water...

281
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,900
we've even left the
city far behind!

282
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,600
You've been driving away for
the last one hour, driver...

283
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,000
You know your way around,
don't you?

284
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,100
Can't you hear me?

285
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,200
l hope you know where
we are headed, driver!

286
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,700
l know it! l know everything!

287
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,800
How am l to blame for the fact that
the city is spread out so much?!

288
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,100
Am l at fault, just because
your son stays far away?

289
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,500
l'll take you the right address...
But just keep quiet! Okay?

290
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,900
- Just talk to him, Mister...
- That's okay!

291
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,900
Just shut up now, okay?

292
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,100
we'd have made it to Mogal Sarai
from Benaras in so much of time.

293
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,500
l'm a smart man; l've been received a
letter acknowledging my achievements.

294
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,500
l've even spent some time
with Gandhi.

295
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,100
Don't try to fool me, okay?

296
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,000
l can see your meter
ticking away rapidly!

297
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,300
why are you picking my brains?!

298
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,100
l don't even want any
money from you!

299
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,100
l'll pay you the equivalent
of the fare instead!

300
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,000
l'll think l've been on a pilgrimage;
that l've had a holy bath!

301
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,300
How can you wash away your sins
just like that?

302
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,000
You'd have to come to Benaras for
that and take a dip in the Ganges.

303
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,600
But you must come there.

304
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,200
l'll arrange a bath and a prayer
for you in the Harishchandra shrine.

305
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,300
Oh, sure...

306
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,900
...l'll come there; l'll bathe
and even shave my head bald!

307
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,100
But l will not drive any further!
Not anymore!

308
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,300
Listen, driver...! Listen...

309
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
l hope you've sent the telegram
to the right address.

310
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,500
we've been walking away
like mad-men!

311
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,200
There isn't a human-being
in sight.

312
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,200
Have the people here been
scared away by the snakes?

313
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,900
Real fools you have
here in Bombay.

314
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,800
The bloody cabby
dropped us midway.

315
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,200
These guys don't even recognize
a person for what he's worth!

316
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,000
As for Shiv...!
Let me get my hands on him...

317
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,000
...l'll straighten him out
by the ears!

318
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,900
Take a look at that, father!

319
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,300
Our shop...

320
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,500
He's named the shop
after you.

321
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,400
My name, my foot!
He's mis-spelt my name!

322
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,400
He's clubbed Shambhu
and Nath together...

323
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,200
...whereas, they should
have been written separately.

324
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,200
But we've at least found
the shop, haven't we?

325
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,100
You don't want to pray before
a closed shop, do you?!

326
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,400
we wouldn't have had to go about in
the hot Sun, if Shiv had received us.

327
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
The hot Sun is sometimes
good for health, Father.

328
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,600
l could punch you for that!

329
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,600
The whole of the market is shut...
there's not a betel-vendor in sight.

330
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,900
- Go and find out.
- The betel-leaf vendor, eh?

331
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,300
Go and find the house,
you idiot! You're a fool!

332
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,900
You're absolutely
good-for-nothing!

333
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,200
And where are you taking
that box? Keep it here...

334
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,500
lt has our money, Dad.

335
00:27:25,800 --> 00:28:11,200
who are you? Has Mahadev
( the Lord ) sent you?

336
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,100
- No.
- You will die!

337
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,800
You will die, too...
They're all dead!

338
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You will also die! There's no one
now... they're all gone!

339
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,600
who are you?

340
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,900
l wonder what the ass
has gone and done!

341
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,600
what are you doing outside during
a curfew? Don't move... okay?

342
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,400
what are you doing?!
Go and sit down there!

343
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,000
l just can't figure out
what to do!

344
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,800
And all this had to happen today.
How will l go to the station?

345
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,600
- Open the door!
- who's that?

346
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,600
- The cops? who?!
- Open up!

347
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,900
They claim to be your father
and brother. Do you know them?

348
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,300
- Recognize me, you idiot!
- Father! welcome...

349
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,400
l wonder where they all come from,
to die in Bombay!

350
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,500
To die in Bombay?!

351
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,700
May you always lead
a happy married life.

352
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,900
Here you are, dear... it's the
holy water from the Ganges.

353
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,300
- How was the journey, father?
- lt was rotten!

354
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,100
why didn't you come to the
station to receive us?

355
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
l was actually about to come.
But, then...

356
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,200
That's enough!
Come to me, my son...

357
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,100
Hello! Kashi!

358
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,400
Do you know who l am?
l'm your grandfather.

359
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,500
And l'm the uncle.

360
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,100
- Allow me to touch your feet.
- Oh no! Don't do that!

361
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,300
No formalities. Sheila
doesn't care about these.

362
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,200
The city-bred hardly have
any regard for our customs.

363
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,500
Sheila! why must you keep your
threads and needles lying about?

364
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,400
She was stitching, you see...

365
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,000
So you left home to
live in this hovel!

366
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,100
- How's your work going on?
- Fine.

367
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,300
By the way... l've already taken
an appointment from the doctor.

368
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,500
An appointment with the doctor?

369
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,800
Yes. lt's for the pain in your
throat. You had written about it.

370
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,900
Oh yes. l did write to you.
But, l've only just arrived.

371
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Let me relax for a few days.
The doctor comes later.

372
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,100
This is your house. You can live
here for as long as you wish.

373
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,400
- where's the toilet?
- Over there.

374
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,300
The toilet!
Right beside the kitchen?!

375
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,800
- l'm scared!
- Are you scared of cats?

376
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:42,000
The cat comes to your
house and scares you!

377
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,900
You must chase it away.

378
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,500
- Let's shoo the cat away.
- we did it! Sent the cat scurrying!

379
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,300
Now open your mouth... wide.

380
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,000
wider.

381
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,500
wider, please.

382
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,800
l'm not a buffalo. l can't open
my mouth any wider.

383
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,100
- well, all right.
- want to see anything more?

384
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,000
- No. That'll be enough.
- Go on, if you want to.

385
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,500
No. l needn't see any more.

386
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,300
You see...

387
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
- May l get up?
- Yes. You may.

388
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,400
l'm prescribing some medicines.

389
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,800
- May l put on my shirt?
- Yes. You may.

390
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,400
He had thrown up blood
in a coughing fit.

391
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,600
wait a moment... l'll ask
him about everything.

392
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,600
ls everything all right?

393
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,300
Seems so. But he must be admitted in
a hospital for some examinations.

394
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Admitted to a hospital?!
ls something serious?

395
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,300
l could say for sure
only after l get a report.

396
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,800
He must go through
these tests right away.

397
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:41,100
The test first. And then a report.
And then comes the treatment.

398
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
The medicine-man in
the village is better.

399
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,800
He could tell it all
by the pulse.

400
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,300
Please do not mind him.

401
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,000
How long will he
take to recover?

402
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,700
l can't say. You must have him
admitted to a hospital.

403
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,800
The deity is over there.

404
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,400
You've brought me to sin!
lt was a rotten coconut!

405
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,400
The Lord will burn me alive!
And He won't spare you either!

406
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:08,300
The Lord is merciful. But incite
His anger, and He'll burn you alive.

407
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,400
He doesn't spare anyone then.
He even burnt his spouse Parvati.

408
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,000
But, pray to Him, and He will
even give you back your life.

409
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,500
Forgive Her, Lord.
For she does not know.

410
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,700
watch it!

411
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,300
This is sub-judice. The court has
ruled that the shops may continue...

412
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,200
...to do business till the case is
decided. we can carry on business.

413
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,100
- Yes! That's right!
- You can't do this!

414
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,300
But the papers surely show
that you are the owner.

415
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,200
The papers mean nothing. That which
Katiya wants, is going to happen.

416
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,500
why? ls he the Collector?

417
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,600
Please eat your food.

418
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,800
But who is Katiya?

419
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,000
The local don.
He's a dangerous fellow.

420
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,200
He's trying to evict us.

421
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,600
They are 7 brothers. Every man a
scoundrel. No one can touch them.

422
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,300
who said so? For 200 years, the
English lorded over this country.

423
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,200
And everyone said that
no one can touch them.

424
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Then came Gandhi. l was with him.
we fought for freedom and won it.

425
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:50,000
what a drubbing we gave the English!

426
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,800
My friend Sachdev used to
say things like that.

427
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,600
And look at what happened to him!

428
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,600
He was killed like a dog.

429
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,500
His wife, the poor girl,
lost her mind after that.

430
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,300
He kills people like flies!

431
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,900
Nitwit! Must you speak so
before a child?

432
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
Now what's the matter
with the brave boy?

433
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,200
Katiya will kill all of us!

434
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,400
To hell with Katiya! Lord Rama
killed the 1 0-headed demon.

435
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,700
Our brave little boy will kill the
one-headed Katiya. won't you, dear?

436
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,500
- won't you kill him?
- Yes!

437
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,900
lt's you!

438
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,300
Greetings!

439
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,100
l had heard that people
get lost in this city.

440
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,100
Nice meeting again.

441
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,800
- l'm new to this city.
- l see.

442
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Just came in from Benaras.

443
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,100
- Do you live here?
- Yes.

444
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
l thought so.

445
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,600
- You seem to be working.
- Yes. l'm a nurse in a hospital.

446
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,200
- l'm in a hospital too.
- what?!

447
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,300
l mean to say that l take my father
to the hospital every other day.

448
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,900
He's suffering from
an ailing throat.

449
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,200
we're here for his
medical treatment.

450
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,300
How haven't l seen
you in the hospital?

451
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,900
ls there only one hospital
in Bombay?

452
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,900
- Are you going to the hospital?
- No. l'm after the city sights.

453
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,300
l had asked my brother
to take me out to town.

454
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,600
But he apologized saying '' Kashi....''

455
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,000
l'm Kashi Nath.
People call me Kashi.

456
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,000
He gave me a list of the
bus-routes and told me...

457
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,200
- what's your name?
- Gauri; people call me that.

458
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,700
well... that's how l'm supposed
to go about the city.

459
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:57,300
Bus no. 80 to Bandra.
No. 84 Ltd. to Haji Ali.

460
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Goodness! l must try out
the fruit juices at Haji Ali!

461
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,900
why are you laughing?

462
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,600
Let me give you
a tour of the city.

463
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,100
- Really?!
- Sure.

464
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,900
That'd be fun!

465
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,700
won't you wait till
the bus arrives?

466
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,200
Sure!

467
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,700
That's the film star,
Amitabh Bachchan's house.

468
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,000
- You wanted to see it, didn't you?
- This is great, l say!

469
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,800
- would brother be in now?
- Brother?!

470
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,500
Brother Amit ( Amitabh Bachan,
the film star)

471
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,700
lt's like this; he's actually from
Allahabad and l'm from Benaras.

472
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,100
Both hail from towns on the banks of
the Ganges. Aren't we brothers then?

473
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,100
Oh sure... you're brothers indeed.

474
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,400
would you like to convey
something to your fans?

475
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:51,800
Only that religion and caste
be prevented from...

476
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,200
...leading to the division
of this great country.

477
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,100
Actually, this nation is
a home for all of us.

478
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,300
we must try to live together
like a family.

479
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,100
we must care for the whole house...

480
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,100
...and not just our own rooms.

481
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Our rooms will remain intact, only
if the house itself is secure.

482
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,100
Looks like '' brother''
has recognized you.

483
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,700
why not? we're brothers, after all!

484
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,300
But it was fun, really!

485
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,500
- Don't look there! Please!
- why not?

486
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,300
what a shame!

487
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,200
Thief! Thief... Catch him!

488
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,200
Catch him, someone!

489
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,300
The swine was running away
with the purse!

490
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,000
- Your aim is amazing!
- what's so amazing?

491
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,600
That's how l knocked off a ripe
mango, amongst raw ones, as a child.

492
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,700
- with such a little stone.
- l see!

493
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,700
l had a coconut today... and the
idiot's head was even bigger!

494
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,600
- l had to find my mark!
- lt's really been fun!

495
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,300
You're right!
lt's really been fun...

496
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,800
- lt's over.
- Yes.

497
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,300
All the water in that
coconut is over!

498
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,400
- That's okay.
- Shall we move then?

499
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,000
Katiya's expecting us,
isn't he?

500
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,800
Yes. l had sent word.

501
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,900
l'm told that anyone who comes
to Katiya with a grievance...

502
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,900
...is buried alive
in these pillars.

503
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,200
That's right! No one has ever
been seen walking out alive.

504
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,400
- Cut the nonsense! Just shut up!
- And where are you going?

505
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,400
The truth is that such people are
dangerous for the crooks...

506
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
...but they're straight
with decent folks.

507
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,300
we have nothing to fear.

508
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,200
lt's only that the pillars
reminded me. Or l wouldn't...

509
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,700
Shut up! You always remember
the wrong things!

510
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,500
Don't move! Freeze!

511
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,700
lt's a soldier who's
come to fetch you.

512
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,600
Just follow it quietly.

513
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,700
- lt's been tamed... Come along.
- Are we so easily dispensable?

514
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,300
what is it?

515
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,500
These people wish
to say something.

516
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:15,500
Actually... some thugs had come
to our shops, the other day.

517
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,500
what l mean is that some
folks came to our shops.

518
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,200
Decent folks, actually...

519
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,700
Our shops don't run now...

520
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,900
lt's very difficult because...

521
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,300
...they've piled up building
material before our shops...

522
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,700
- lt's an obstacle, you see...
- lf that were removed, we could...

523
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Talk to him about the
legal angle, Gopal...

524
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,700
Go on... speak!
what are you afraid of?

525
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,800
- Not me, please!
- what he wants to say is that...

526
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,900
...even the Courts
have ruled that...

527
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,200
The soldier hates someone talking
loudly to my brother-in-law.

528
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,900
what l wanted to say is that
even the Courts have ruled...

529
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,200
Never mind that... The Court
has its own place.

530
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:14,200
we've been earning a livelihood in
your ''empire'' for 2 5 to 30 years.

531
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,900
Our shops are giving us
our bread and butter.

532
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,500
Anything that you decide...

533
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,000
The soldier also hates anyone
raising a finger at brother-in-law!

534
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:30,000
we will abide by any
decision that you make.

535
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,400
- He's right! Anything you say...
- Please consider our plight...

536
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,500
How many days had l given you
to have Gol Chowk vacated?

537
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,900
l was to have it vacated
in a month.

538
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,300
lt's already a month, isn't it?

539
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,100
Cut-off one of your fingers then.

540
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,200
Running errands? People give
doctors the status of God.

541
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,400
But l'd place the nurse
in the same category, too.

542
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,000
How much you care
for the patients!

543
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,500
ln fact, l think you nurses
ought to receive an award.

544
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,700
Let's skip this thing about me;
tell me about yourself.

545
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
what would you find in my story?

546
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,900
l was an infant when father found
me on the banks of the Ganges.

547
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,100
He was the one who brought me up.

548
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,800
ln fact, he loves me even more
than he loves his own son.

549
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,900
Brother Shiv would never
agree with me...

550
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,300
...but he loves me a lot, too.

551
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,900
They all love me. Father even wanted
me to study medicine or engineering.

552
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,600
But l was never really
cut out for studies.

553
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,700
And l now work in an
iron-products' factory.

554
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,100
Come to think of it, l'm very
'' qualified'' and ''elegant'' .

555
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,400
You mean, ''qualified'' and
'' intelligent'' , don't you?

556
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,100
But Dad doesn't understand...
He always calls me dumb-headed.

557
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,900
Do l look dumb to you?

558
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:58,900
Ripper - Naveen @ -=DrC=-

559
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,300
lt's a shame that you take
so much of time...

560
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,200
...to open the lock
of your own house!

561
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,300
A burglar would open it faster,
without a key!

562
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,700
That can't be, father...

563
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,500
lt's an old lock. which is why
the key gets stuck.

564
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,600
Gets stuck, my foot!

565
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,600
Kashi's a strange chap...
l wonder where he disappears.

566
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,500
Didn't your wife know we're
returning from the hospital?!

567
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,000
She should've been here!

568
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,000
She's gone to fetch
the kid from school.

569
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,300
She must've been caught
in a traffic-jam.

570
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,100
Caught, indeed...
Get me a glass of water!

571
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,900
- well, okay. Please sit down...
- Go on!

572
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,600
what a strange city, this Bombay!

573
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,400
You have people getting caught
in buses and local-trains!

574
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,900
The deadly diseases would kill
a man only later...

575
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,500
...but the crowds and the
pollution will get to him first!

576
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,500
They just don't consider
you to be human.

577
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,900
They push a man in the crowded
local trains, against his wishes...

578
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,500
...and shove him out
without his will, too!

579
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,200
Father?! You're returned
very quickly from the hospital.

580
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,800
l'll give you a blow!

581
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,500
Have l returned early or have
you returned late, you idiot?!

582
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,700
- where had you been?
- l was held up, Dad...

583
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,800
- Not you, too?!
- l'd actually been to meet someone.

584
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,300
- who's that you went to meet?
- Gauri... she's a nurse.

585
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,300
l was making friends with her;
she could be of help.

586
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,400
You're back, are you?
And could you see the sights?

587
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:07,100
Actually, l'd asked him to go
and see the sights in the city.

588
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,800
ldiot! ls he here to see the sights
or have me treated?!

589
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,400
l'm fed of making
the trip everyday.

590
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,900
Either have me admitted
in the hospital...

591
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,700
...or send me away to Benaras...

592
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,600
Have some water, father...

593
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,600
Really?! That's wonderful news,
my friend!

594
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,600
My father's terribly ill, Mister.
Please let us have a room.

595
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,000
l've already told you
so many times...

596
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,500
...that there's no room for
any more patients in the hospital.

597
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,200
l'll join you, too!

598
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,100
There isn't much work here.
lt can always be taken care of.

599
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,900
- The doctor has sent a note.
- Sent a note, eh?

600
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,400
Then have the patient admitted
in the doctor's house!

601
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,800
what can l do, when
there's no room?

602
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,900
l can't possibly have him
lying on my head, can l?!

603
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,900
- Have you got an admission?
- No; he says there's no room.

604
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,600
Couldn't you manage it then?

605
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,600
Didn't you tell him who l am?

606
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,600
l've fought the war for freedom
with Mr. Gandhi!

607
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,900
where's Shiv?

608
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,900
He's gone to talk to someone, too.

609
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,200
Talk! Big deal! Can't you
do anything else, but talk?!

610
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,800
lf you happen to know a ward-boy
or a maid in the hospital...

611
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,500
...you could manage
to wrap this up quickly.

612
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,100
well, never mind...

613
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,000
Take this... and go
and show it to him!

614
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,600
Let me see how he still
refuses me an admission!

615
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,100
Go on... Hurry up!

616
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,900
- Mister... Mister!
- what is it?

617
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,400
- Take a look at this.
- what is that?

618
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,800
lt's a certificate of honor.

619
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,400
And what's this certificate
supposed to mean?

620
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,900
My father got this for the services
he rendered to the country.

621
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,500
lt's for him that we need the room.

622
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,300
Yes, Sir? ... Very well, Sir...
l'll be on my way!

623
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,600
My father had joined Mr. Gandhi in the
battle for the nation's lndependence.

624
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,300
why did he fight for lndependence?
what have we got out of it?

625
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,800
Those days of slavery were better
than these times of freedom!

626
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,900
The entire system has rotted!

627
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,600
And they bring certificates
of honor to the hospitals!

628
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,100
They should've sold it
in scrap instead!

629
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,600
Haven't l told you there's no room?
Please leave me alone!

630
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,500
There's no point in running
from pillar to post.

631
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,900
Bring a thousand Rupees and
l could pull a few strings.

632
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,500
lf it's okay with you,
come to the rear-entrance.

633
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,400
You've got admission, haven't you?
which room is it?

634
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,800
Answer me... which room
could you get?

635
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,800
Couldn't you manage it?
Useless chaps, you both are!

636
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,300
Didn't you show him
this certificate?

637
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,600
l did! l did show him
the certificate!

638
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,400
And he asked him to fling it
in the garbage can!

639
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,200
why did you ever have to
fight for our lndependence?!

640
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,000
what has our lndependence
given us?

641
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,700
when they don't care for the Gandhi
they pretend to revere, who are you?

642
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,500
Please calm down, Mister...

643
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,900
we have a man dying here...

644
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,600
...and that chap is busy
chatting away on telephone!

645
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,000
He's reading a novel!
And that pimp of his...

646
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,100
...asks for a thousand Rupees
for the admission!

647
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,000
- Sit down... please.
- Are we here for fun?!

648
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,700
ls this a pleasure-trip?!

649
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,300
They just can't understand
a poor man's dilemma.

650
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,800
They treat us like animals!

651
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,600
They've made a slaughter-house
out of this bloody hospital!

652
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,100
The poor will die here,
on a bench like this...

653
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,900
...but they still
wouldn't be concerned.

654
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,900
Hey, Kashi... what's up?
Calm down...

655
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,200
l've got the admission for Dad...
Let's go... Come on.

656
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,900
Come along...

657
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,400
Tell Mr. Bharat that his
work will be taken care of.

658
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,600
But the supply of currency-notes
mustn't stop, okay?

659
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,800
Here's Laxmi ( the Goddess
of wealth ), Savitri.

660
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,400
Laxmi? where is she?

661
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,600
lt's the Goddess of wealth...
the money, l'm talking about!

662
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:41,200
How often have l told you not to
give me the money you get in bribes?

663
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,500
l can very well manage
in the salary you earn.

664
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,800
- Get on with it, Pinky...
- There you go again!

665
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,400
l'm not earning it for myself, am l?
lt's only for my darling, Pinky...

666
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,700
...so that she can have all the
comforts and luxuries in life.

667
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,300
But you don't ever
stop nagging me!

668
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,600
That's because l always
have a fear in my mind...

669
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,200
...that your ill-gotten wealth could
shatter the happiness of our family.

670
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,400
Stop it now!

671
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,500
what brings you here?

672
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,400
That's because some hooligans
ransacked Mishra's shop yesterday.

673
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,300
As for the police complaint,
we have already lodged it.

674
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:26,200
But this morning, a couple of thugs
beat up his son very severely.

675
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,200
lt was a brutal beating, Sir...
They've broken his hand...

676
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,800
...and even cracked his skull.
Please do something, Sir...

677
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,100
when we took his son to the
hospital, the doctor said...

678
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,300
...it's a police case;
that we should lodge a complaint.

679
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,800
Since it all happened because of
the complaint he lodged yesterday...

680
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,800
...we don't know whether we should
lodge another complaint or not...

681
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,500
That's not really the problem.

682
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:50,700
But l can't engage a constable for
every person's security, can l?

683
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,800
- You're right, Sir.
- well, suppose...

684
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,400
...l post some constables
on duty at the square.

685
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,800
The thugs would return and bash him
up, the minute the police leave.

686
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,700
Actually it's that piece of land
which is causing problems.

687
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,300
Vacate the place as soon as possible
and hand it over to Katiya...

688
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,800
...your problem will be solved.

689
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,400
The land and the shops belong
to these gentlemen, lnspector.

690
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,600
why don't you imprison those thugs,
instead of throwing these people out?

691
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,800
who's this man?

692
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,100
This is Kashi; he's
come in from Benaras.

693
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,800
He's Shiva's younger brother.

694
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,200
Shiv took his father to the hospital,
and his brother joined us instead.

695
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,300
lt's always better to
come in groups, isn't it?

696
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,400
- Greet the lnspector.
- Now this is another problem!

697
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,900
what's happened to you, dear?
You're bleeding!

698
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,300
The cursed blade! why don't
you use the pencil-sharpener!

699
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,000
And what are you asking
silly questions for?!

700
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,900
Look! She's bleeding...

701
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,200
Don't just stand and watch!
Call the doctor...

702
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,000
Call him up and tell him
that we're coming there...

703
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,300
Don't worry, dear...
lt'll be alright.

704
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,600
- She's hurt her finger.
- Must've bled a lot.

705
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,700
what will happen of my son?

706
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,500
we'll see about that later...
Shall we leave?

707
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,900
Here we are at last!

708
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,500
Hey, you! You'll get a punch!

709
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,400
They're terribly rash drivers.

710
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,300
This is our shop...
but is today a holiday?

711
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,900
what holiday? All shops
on that side are open.

712
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,700
But brother had told me
that we'd meet here.

713
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,100
And all shops on this side
are closed, too.

714
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,900
- where could they have gone?
- They're all dead!

715
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,500
They're all dead!

716
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,900
Come closer... come on!

717
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,400
They're all dead...
l'm the only one alive.

718
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:44,400
You must've been sent here
by the Lord, right?

719
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,800
This shop here belongs
to Sachdev.

720
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,800
lt's our shop, you know!

721
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,300
what are you looking for?
what do you want?

722
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,600
You get everything here...
care for some bridal-wear?

723
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,900
The lady's a nut!

724
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:06,700
Running away, eh?! You're a nut...
And so is your whole family!

725
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,100
You're going to die, too,
you rascal!

726
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,800
l can't say why, but l always feel
as if l've heard her voice earlier.

727
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:21,300
This woman and her husband have paid
a price for living with dignity.

728
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,100
They're staring their construction
from today.

729
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,200
How about our business?!
what will happen to our shops...

730
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,700
what business are you
talking about?

731
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,400
we keep our shops open for not more
than a week in a month, in any case.

732
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,100
- So? There was at least something...
- when will the buildings come up?

733
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,400
This builder has a great reputation;
his buildings come up overnight!

734
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,000
- what?!
- l heard that being said...

735
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:07,600
He's going to die!
The scoundrel's going to die!

736
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,200
He's even digging a grave
for himself!

737
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,500
- Sawant! Take her away...
- You'll die a miserable death!

738
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,300
Curse be on you, you swine!

739
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,600
- You'll die... you surely will!
- Take her away!

740
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,800
You'll die thirsting for water!
Your sins will run their course!

741
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,500
There won't be a soul to sympathize
with your clan, you scum!

742
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,300
You have killed my husband...

743
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,700
...and l will kill you!

744
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,200
l will kill you!

745
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,600
There! The pitcher's broken
even before your funeral...

746
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,300
...l mean, even before you
can complete the ceremony!

747
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:50,400
You're going to die!
You will be wiped out!

748
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,300
- Father!
- How long have you taken to come!

749
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,500
l can't help it. l have to change
three buses to get here.

750
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,900
The nurse said that we'd
have to leave the hospital.

751
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,100
- why is that?
- How would l know?!

752
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,600
- Go and ask the doctor...
- Very well.

753
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:17,100
And tell him that my problem
is getting worse.

754
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,600
How are we going to manage?
Go and talk to him...

755
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,700
- Go on, will you?!
- l'm off, Dad... here l go.

756
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,900
Have you asked my father
to go home, doctor?

757
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,400
That's right, Kashi.

758
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,300
Your father is now in the
last stages of cancer.

759
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:50,900
l'm sorry, but it's too late...
Nothing can be done about it.

760
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,200
Can't we do anything about it?

761
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:00,400
with such a renowned hospital
and its qualified doctors...

762
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,500
Please take another look at him...

763
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
we have come to you
with great hopes.

764
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:12,200
You don't have to worry
about the costs, doctor.

765
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,200
we'd even sell everything we own!

766
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,900
But save my father...
Please!

767
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,700
Please save my father

768
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,600
Your father has just
another month or two.

769
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,300
which is why l felt that he must
spend the rest of his days...

770
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,000
...with his family.

771
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,000
Take him home.

772
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,500
You will have to be brave, Kashi.

773
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,700
who'd look after him, if you
were to break up like this?

774
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,800
Get a hold on yourself.

775
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,800
what did the doctor say?

776
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:44,000
The doctor says that you'll recover
with the medicines at home.

777
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,300
He says there's no need for you
to stay here anymore.

778
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,900
But didn't you tell him that
the pain is getting worse?

779
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,600
He's prescribed a medicine for that;
that will help you recover.

780
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:07,200
lf l stay here, l'd have the nurses
and doctors should l need something.

781
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:15,800
You'd recover faster at home,
with your own people around.

782
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,900
That is right, too.

783
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:26,500
Very well then... we'll return
to Benaras in that case.

784
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,400
Let's take Shiv and
his wife along, too.

785
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,700
The kid's thread-ceremony
is yet to be performed...

786
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:47,100
Besides, that road we're laying
to the temple in Benaras...

787
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,000
...l've also got to obtain
a sanction for that.

788
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,400
l've got to have the
school inaugurated.

789
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:57,700
l can accomplish all this in a
matter of a few months in Benaras.

790
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,800
My son...

791
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,600
Listen, son...

792
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:34,600
...death is a reality,
just as life is.

793
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,100
One has to accept it.

794
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,800
Be brave, my son...

795
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:46,200
l have already lived my life...

796
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:52,400
...and want to spend the rest of
my days with dignity.

797
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,800
That's all l ask
God to grant me.

798
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,500
You mustn't let this shake you...
You're my brave boy, aren't you?

799
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,600
Let's go... Come on.

800
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:09,400
Don't, my son... Stop crying...!

801
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:14,000
Let's go... Come on, my son.

802
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,600
Let's go... Get up.
Come on...

803
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,500
And look; don't tell anyone
at home about this, okay?

804
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,500
They'll be terribly worried.

805
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,100
Let's not tell anyone, okay?
Let's leave then... Come on.

806
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,200
Stand up... let's take our
things and leave...

807
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,900
Get up,... Come on.

808
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,100
You dare insult Katiya, eh!

809
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,900
That man... that rascal
is hitting me!

810
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,200
He's hitting me!

811
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,300
Listen, fellow...
Just get lost! Scram!

812
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:29,900
No! l don't want anyone
of you to interfere!

813
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,100
Let's get away, Kashi... that's
Katiya's thug; a vicious character.

814
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,400
Get him!

815
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:19,700
They're all dead...
And you will also not escape!

816
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:27,900
You're being funny, brother!

817
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,200
Our guys get beaten up
and you laugh at it!

818
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,100
what else can l do, but laugh?

819
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,500
Just imagine...

820
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:38,300
...one man, all alone, beats up
1 0 of my boys in the marketplace.

821
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,800
- what a sight it must've been!
- Must've been a terrific sight!

822
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,100
l wish we could all see it, too.

823
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,200
Shut up! The day l strip you
in the marketplace...

824
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,700
...everyone will have
a sight to behold!

825
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,900
Let me have some chicken...
the leg-portion.

826
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,900
So, tell me now... what am
l supposed to do with you?

827
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,000
Just give me one more
opportunity, Sir...

828
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,800
l could even give up
my life for you.

829
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,900
He'd even give up his
life for me, he says.

830
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:04,800
Very well then...
l'll take your life.

831
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,500
Throw him the lion's cage.

832
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,200
Kashi...! Come on! Hurry up!
Let's go... leave that alone!

833
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,400
- Let's go! Hurry!
- what's wrong?

834
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,700
Have you had a fight with someone?

835
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,600
- wear this! Quick!
- But what's up?

836
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,400
l'll tell you later... Just don't
open the door for anyone.

837
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,100
what's going on, Shiva...
where are you taking Kashi to...

838
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,700
The chaps you've beaten up
belong to Katiya's mob!

839
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,100
He hacks people to pieces in
a crowded marketplace!

840
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,700
- This is not your home-town.
- l know that!

841
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,500
This is a city of eunuchs!

842
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:46,000
They beat up a woman and humiliate
her in broad-daylight...

843
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:48,600
...and all you do is to
watch the fun!

844
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,100
Anyone who helps her is a fool!
An ass!

845
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,400
And what have you achieved out
of it?! what's the big deal?!

846
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,400
You've saved her today... alright.

847
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,900
But what happens when they
beat her up again?

848
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,500
l'll give him a thrashing again!
l'll beat them up all over again!

849
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:04,000
lf something like this happens in my
presence, l'll beat them up again!

850
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,500
l just can't bear to
watch it silently!

851
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,800
lf someone were to misbehave
with your wife in public...

852
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,900
...would you still be
giving me the same advise?

853
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,800
what's all this?!
who are you?!

854
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,600
- where's he?! where's Kashi?
- He's not around.

855
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:31,800
Flexing your muscles, eh?
Encouraging thugs, are you?

856
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,500
- where's Kashi? we want him!
- But what has he done?

857
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,600
Shut up... or you'll be
cut to pieces!

858
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:42,500
lf you want the kid back, bring
Kashi to us and take the kid away.

859
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,800
Or we'll make mincemeat
out of the kid!

860
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:48,800
My son... !

861
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,100
Oh, get lost!

862
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,400
what can they do at most?
Kill me, isn't it?

863
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,500
l'd even die, but l'd never
leave father alone!

864
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,000
You don't know about this, brother.
But the doctor says father is...

865
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,100
Are you his own flesh
and blood then?

866
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,300
l'm his own son!

867
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,900
l care for him, too!

868
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:13,600
Try to understand this, Kashi!

869
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,600
Your presence here will
endanger our lives, too!

870
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,700
They are capable of doing anything!
And just don't worry about Dad...

871
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
l'll take care of him!
Here's what you must do...

872
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:25,100
Keep this money. There's a train
leaving from here at dawn tomorrow.

873
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,500
Take the train; it's not safe
for you to stay here anymore!

874
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,000
l must leave now.

875
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,100
Even after knowing that
Kashi's life is in danger...

876
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,700
...you still left him there,
all alone?!

877
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,300
That too, in a city where
he knows no one?!

878
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,000
Had you gone mad?
You bloody coward!

879
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,800
So what if he's not
your own brother...

880
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,600
...he means much more than
what brothers really are!

881
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,000
He'd give his life for you!

882
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,900
He's turned out to be a
better person than you are!

883
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,600
when you left for the city to
achieve something in life...

884
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,900
...he was the one who cared
for me in the village.

885
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,700
He did everything
a son should do!

886
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:12,100
Kashi has a heart of gold...
My son, Kashi, is a real gem!

887
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:16,100
l will not stay here anymore.

888
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,000
l will return to my son.

889
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,100
l'll even breathe my last there.

890
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,900
And l don't need people to carry
my bier to the cremation ground!

891
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,300
Kashi alone is enough
to do that for me!

892
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,000
For how long will you sit there
like a bloody statue?

893
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,100
who will bring back your son?

894
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,400
They've said that they want Kashi
in return for your son.

895
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:44,400
And since Kashi is not here now,
how will your son return?

896
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:48,100
what will you do, if something
happens to your son?!

897
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:54,100
O Lord! You've always
been merciful towards us...

898
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,500
- where can l find Katiya?
- why do you want Katiya at this hour?

899
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,300
l want him...
Let's go and find him!

900
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,700
- But what's happened?
- They've taken my nephew away!

901
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,500
They want me... they'll get me!
Let's go and find Katiya.

902
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,900
- But Katiya...
- l'll tear the scoundrel apart...

903
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,800
...if my nephew suffers
as much as a scratch!

904
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:17,000
Relax, Kashi... the kid will
be okay; God will protect him.

905
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,600
Besides, you just can't walk in
on Katiya like this.

906
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,400
lt's difficult to tell the
movements of even his brothers.

907
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,200
But you can meet his
brother Antya tomorrow.

908
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,900
He visits the City light Club every
evening to collect the spoils.

909
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,300
This is where you will
find him, Kashi.

910
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
- l'll find Antya here, won't l?
- of course; he comes here everyday.

911
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,800
Two tickets, please.

912
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,200
Don't let the joint mislead you.

913
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,000
lt isn't what it appears to be.

914
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,500
Let's go inside... the
real fun lies there.

915
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,700
Leave me alone, Chandru...
Else, he'll go away!

916
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:13,100
Easy come, easy go, baby...
Nothing comes out of it!

917
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:19,000
- what's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

918
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,200
Do you know that girl?

919
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,800
- That isn't the same Gauri, is she?
- No.

920
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:32,800
Here you are, Sir...
Today's collection.

921
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,500
So little?

922
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,100
Have you been stealing the dough
or are the collections really low?

923
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:41,000
Anrway... go and deal with Gauri.
And you keep the money.

924
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,000
How will we manage if you
continue like this, Gauri?

925
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,900
The bosses at the Club
will throw us out...

926
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:50,800
...and without the money, how will
l be able to treat your sister?

927
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,500
what'll l do? Nothing...

928
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,200
And there are so many more tests
that have to be carried out.

929
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,600
Tell me now, whether this
is true or not...

930
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,900
A lame-horse is always
shot dead, isn't it?

931
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,200
what do we do with the humans?
Nothing?

932
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,700
Aren't you ashamed to speak
like this about your wife?

933
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Not at all.

934
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,400
Okay. You'll get the kid.

935
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,700
But you'd have to fight
Akram Khan Paqhtuni for that.

936
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,500
To get my nephew back,
l'd fight anyone.

937
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,600
Uncle! Uncle!

938
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,200
That's a terrible character!

939
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:10,200
He kills a man and then
plucks his heart out!

940
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,300
That's what they say about him.

941
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,700
He'd need a real heart
to pluck out mine.

942
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,400
- My son!
- Uncle!

943
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,800
lt's good that you've stopped him.

944
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,200
Or you'd have been six brothers
instead of seven!

945
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:35,100
l'm happy to have witnessed
your acts of bravery.

946
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:38,000
You will also be happy to know...

947
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:42,700
...that you shall henceforth
work for my gang.

948
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,800
This is a laborer's hand, Katiya...

949
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,300
...which can even mould raw iron.

950
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,700
This is strength l've earned from
money earned with toil and sweat.

951
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,500
l don't need to live on the
crumbs somebody throws to me.

952
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,000
Rather than live the life of
scum in the filthy streets...

953
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:03,300
...you should rather live among
real men; like a tiger.

954
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:06,400
Even a caged-tiger is nothing
more than a mere dog, Katiya!

955
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:09,400
You want me to be a mere dog
at your feet, do you?

956
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,400
A dog which barks and
bites at your will?!

957
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:17,000
You could say that...
So what's wrong?

958
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,600
Should you work for me,
you'll soon be famous.

959
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:23,200
You'll receive handsome rewards.

960
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,100
Besides earning a lot of money...

961
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,800
...you'll be a
widely respected man...

962
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,900
...and people will
be terrified of you.

963
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:33,500
Only cowards, who have water flowing
in their veins, terrorize people!

964
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,200
lf you're really fond of
flaunting your manliness...

965
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:39,300
...stop depending
on your dogs, Katiya!

966
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,200
He walks into our den
and humiliates us!

967
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,800
That's enough!

968
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:19,600
l'll now have to plan
a death for him.

969
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:37,300
- Yes, sister?
- what's wrong?

970
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,500
You seem to be lost in
your thoughts these days.

971
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,500
what's up? Had a tiff
with Kashi, did you?

972
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:45,300
Not at all. There's nothing
of the sort, sister.

973
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,300
Didn't you tell me that
Kashi's going to visit us?

974
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:50,400
when is he coming over?

975
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:57,100
He'll never come here
now, sister... Never.

976
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,700
But why?

977
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:03,500
- He saw me at the club.
- So?

978
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:10,000
l hadn't told him that
l dance at the club...

979
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,600
And why didn't you tell him?

980
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,500
You should've told him...

981
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,600
...that it's not
out of your will...

982
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,500
...but to save your sister
that you dance at the club!

983
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,600
l knew something of the sort
would happen one day.

984
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,900
And you...! Hadn't l already
warned you?

985
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,700
why are you spoiling your life
for my sake?

986
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:38,100
l wish l'd die...

987
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,700
Don't say that, sister...

988
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:46,100
lt's still not late...

989
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,500
Tell Kashi the truth...
l'm sure he'd understand.

990
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,500
l'm sure he'd never desert you.

991
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,300
Please hear me out, Kashi...

992
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:07,000
what else can l now listen to?
Haven't l already seen enough?

993
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,300
Try and con the Almighty now...

994
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,900
He's innocent;
He'll believe your tale.

995
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,900
But it is you l want to
explain the truth to!

996
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:27,900
we had to go through all this
because of Chandru.

997
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:32,000
l wanted to tell you everything
on several occasions...

998
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:39,200
But for fear of losing you,
l just couldn't...

999
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,100
l'll leave now, Kashi.

1000
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,300
l'm taking my father back
to Benaras tomorrow.

1001
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:59,600
The doctor has given up hopes.

1002
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:06,200
He wants my father to spend
the rest of his days in peace.

1003
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,300
But l will return
to take you away.

1004
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,800
You will accompany me
to Benaras, won't you?

1005
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:34,500
l'd have been happy, had
you too accompanied us, Shiv.

1006
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,100
This thing about the land
is yet to be sorted out.

1007
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,500
Besides, my son has his school too.
l can't come over just yet.

1008
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:45,000
well then, brother... Forgive me
for any mistake l must've made.

1009
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,300
why must you say that?!

1010
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:52,500
You'll see that l'll call you back
the moment this thing is sorted out.

1011
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,900
And you... why did you have to
take Katiya on again?

1012
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,800
- Couldn't you keep quiet?
- And do what? Be a slave to him?

1013
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,800
- Lick his feet?!
- There you go again...

1014
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,700
l hate this habit of yours!

1015
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,400
Just forget the past.

1016
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,400
You must never fight when
you set out on a journey.

1017
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:14,500
Take good care of your
wife and your son, okay?

1018
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
You'll come to me at Benaras,
won't you Munna?

1019
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,800
Bless you.

1020
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,600
what are you guys up to?!

1021
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:30,400
Let him go! Leave him alone!
what has he done, after all?!

1022
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,900
Leave him alone!

1023
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:35,600
Listen! Please listen to me!

1024
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,700
Listen! Please!

1025
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,300
The window! Use the window!
Hurry up!

1026
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:20,600
Let him go!

1027
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:22,900
Someone save my brother,...!

1028
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,500
Help! Don't hit him!

1029
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:36,600
Let him go! Please don't hit him!

1030
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,900
Please save Kashi!

1031
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,700
Let Kashi go, Katiya...
Please spare him!

1032
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:27,900
Please don't hit him!
Please let my son go!

1033
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:40,200
No...! Please don't!

1034
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,500
Please set my son free!

1035
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,800
Your father's a bloody dog!

1036
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,100
Do you see that, Kashi Nath?!

1037
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,700
You had claimed that you didn't
want to be a dog at my feet.

1038
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:42,300
But look at this...

1039
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:46,900
...your father is wagging his
tail before me, as a dog would!

1040
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:49,300
He's even licking my boots!

1041
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,800
And a dog's offspring can only
be a dog; never a lion!

1042
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:58,100
Your father's a dog;
and you're a son-of-bitch!

1043
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,600
You're a dog, no less!

1044
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,400
l could have killed you the
other day, if l so wished.

1045
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:13,100
But granting you death then...

1046
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,100
...would have been a reward
for your bravery...

1047
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:16,600
...and not a punishment!

1048
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:18,400
This... this is your punishment!

1049
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,500
Just look at his state...
this is what your punishment is!

1050
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:26,800
You will curse yourself every time
you take a breath, hereafter!

1051
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:31,300
Your life will seem to be a burden
and you will long for death!

1052
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:36,700
when you've had enough,
come to my doorstep...

1053
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:40,900
Should l feel charitable then,
l'll grant you death, too!

1054
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:53,100
Go on, you filthy dog...
Go to your puppy!

1055
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,100
- Father...
- My son!

1056
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,500
Father!

1057
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,200
How's your father now?

1058
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,800
- Look, Kashi...
- what's going on over here?!

1059
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,900
what are you both doing here,
so late in the night?

1060
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,300
Nothing; we were only sitting here.
Let's go, Kashi...

1061
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,900
How can you do this?
Don't you respect the law?

1062
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:04,600
we stay in the neighborhood
and so...

1063
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:07,000
This girl? She's the one who
dances in the seedy joint.

1064
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:09,000
Dances, eh? Lock her up then...

1065
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:17,600
Don't! Please, don't!

1066
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,600
Please don't hit me!

1067
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,600
Stop it, Kashi...! Let him go!

1068
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:33,800
Leave him alone, Kashi! Please!

1069
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:36,900
And what will these guys do?
Kill me, eh?!

1070
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,900
They can only hang me, isn't it?

1071
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:42,200
l'm rather die...but l can't
live the life of a coward!

1072
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:43,800
l can't be impotent!

1073
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,800
How can l tolerate anyone
touching you in my presence?

1074
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:48,400
l'd hack them to pieces!

1075
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:52,600
where were they, when those swines
made a dog out of my father?!

1076
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,900
ls it a sin to wish to live
with honor and dignity?

1077
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,900
All we want is to lead
a life of respect!

1078
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:05,700
we had only come here to
have my father treated.

1079
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,900
And they made a dog out of him!

1080
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:13,400
They revere him, back there
in Benaras; they salute him!

1081
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,100
And what happens here?

1082
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,200
Out here,...

1083
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:29,100
No, Kashi... Don't cry.

1084
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:55,400
He's a very nice man, lnspector...
Please let him go.

1085
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,400
Let him go is not the problem.

1086
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:02,500
The problem is that when
you're in love with him...

1087
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:04,800
...why didn't you drill
some sense into him?

1088
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:08,600
why did he have to
mess with Katiya at all?

1089
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:11,800
This is what he gets out of
messing with Katiya, right?

1090
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:16,700
Had he worked for Katiya, he could
have quietly enjoyed himself.

1091
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,600
Quietly? Like you, isn't it?

1092
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,100
Shedding all his shame
in the process, right?

1093
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Great! You dance in a seedy joint...
and talk of respect?!

1094
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:34,500
Of course l dance... that too,
in a club.

1095
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:37,700
l earn my money with
sheer hard work...

1096
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:39,900
...and don't earn my livelihood
from sin, like you do!

1097
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,800
You earn your bread and butter
from the Government...

1098
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,500
...but you're a slave to Katiya!

1099
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:50,700
Just you wait...!

1100
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:54,200
Now where is my register?

1101
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,400
Once l file charges against him,
he'll be thrown in for 7 years!

1102
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:01,800
Very well then... go ahead
and file the charges!

1103
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,000
Just you open that register
and start writing. Go on!

1104
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:08,700
The constables attached to
your station, held my held!

1105
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:11,700
Your constables got drunk
and misbehaved with me!

1106
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:15,900
They not only grabbed my hand...
they even tore my clothes! Look!

1107
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,200
They even ripped
open my clothes!

1108
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:22,600
write that! Open your register
and record my statement!

1109
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:25,000
You will record it...
You certainly will!

1110
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:28,300
l'll assemble some women here
who will stand witness!

1111
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,400
File the charges...! Go on!
what are you staring at me for?!

1112
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,300
There's no problem there...
l'm the one with problems.

1113
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,800
Hey... let him go.

1114
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:47,700
we've even tamed that muscleman
you got from Benaras.

1115
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:52,500
we publicly made a dog out
of this chap's father!

1116
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,500
lnspite of all this, your shops are
still open and business goes on!

1117
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:02,000
- But the Courts...
- what Katiya says is the law!

1118
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:06,000
My brother had his special man's
finger cut, all because of you.

1119
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:07,900
Could you still dare do this?

1120
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,600
lt's not a question of daring;
it's our necessity...

1121
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:12,000
Cut the dialogue!

1122
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,500
- Tell us your name.
- Ambikaprasad Satyanarayan Tiwari.

1123
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,700
- How much does your shop measure?
- lt's 1 0 feet by 1 2.

1124
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,400
- Pay him 50,000.
- But it has stuff worth 1 ,50,000!

1125
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,100
lt's 40,000 then.

1126
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:30,700
Quietly take whatever Katiya is
giving you and just get lost!

1127
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:37,200
Don't worry, boss...
l'm keeping a watch on them.

1128
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,400
Anyone who opens the shutters
of his shop...

1129
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:43,200
...will have to lose his life!

1130
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:10,100
You don't wish to be
a dog at my feet!

1131
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:13,400
But look; your father is
very much a dog for me!

1132
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,300
He's even licking my boots!

1133
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:19,400
Your father is a dog for me!

1134
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:24,000
Your father's a dog for me!
He's licking my feet!

1135
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:29,700
Your father's wagging his tail
before me! He's licking my feet!

1136
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:49,100
Learn to contain your
temper, my son.

1137
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:56,100
You came to see whether
l was still alive, right?

1138
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:59,200
So that, after l'm dead...

1139
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:01,500
...you can finish Katiya
and go to prison.

1140
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,700
But you must learn to
nurture your temper.

1141
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,300
when Gandhi was thrown out of
a train in South Africa...

1142
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:15,500
...he didn't waste his fury
on the Ticket Collector.

1143
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,800
ln fact, he preserved
all his rage...

1144
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,600
...and turned into the foundation
of his struggle for lndia's freedom.

1145
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,200
He eventually won lndependence
for his nation.

1146
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,700
That is exactly what you
will have to do, Kashi.

1147
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:37,100
Killing Katiya is not the
solution to our problems.

1148
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,800
Because Katiya is not
our enemy.

1149
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,400
lt is actually the terror he
strikes in people's hearts...

1150
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:47,000
...which is even more lethal than
the cancer that has struck me.

1151
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:50,600
lt is fear that has
stifled all voices.

1152
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:53,000
lt's rendered them hollow!

1153
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:58,200
You will have to instill
confidence in the people...

1154
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:01,500
...and make them so brave...

1155
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:04,900
...that even a child may take on
Katiya, when the need arises!

1156
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:07,400
Katiya will die on his own...

1157
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:11,900
...and we'll never have
another bully again.

1158
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:19,800
Just learn to contain
your anger, my son...

1159
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,100
what are you doing here
at this hour?

1160
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:37,600
Are you drunk?

1161
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:42,800
Lock the shutters.

1162
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:47,500
- Have you had liquor, brother?
- Sure! l've had liquor indeed!

1163
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,900
After ages, l've done something
l felt like doing

1164
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:53,800
l've made up my mind, Kashi.

1165
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,500
l'll give up everything here
and return to Benaras.

1166
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:02,400
Give up everything? This shop...
this land of yours? Everything?

1167
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:09,800
Do you still think everything
here belongs to me?

1168
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:18,300
lt's gone... l've lost
everything, brother.

1169
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:20,800
lt's all over for me.

1170
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:26,700
l'll now manage in the piece
of land l have in Benaras.

1171
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,100
Land? You have no land there.

1172
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,400
we have fields in
Benaras, don't we?

1173
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:33,900
A coward can't ever own
any land, brother.

1174
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,400
what nonsense are you talking?

1175
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,800
You're running away from this
land because of Katiya today.

1176
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:41,900
There'll be another bully tomorrow.
How will you protect your land?

1177
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,400
Stop lecturing me!
You're preaching to me, eh?!

1178
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:48,000
l've personally seen terror
in that square there!

1179
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,000
l have even borne it!

1180
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,500
Okay... l can't indulge
in hooliganism like you do!

1181
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,800
Fighting for one's rights
is not hooliganism!

1182
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,700
Rights, my foot! which rights
are you talking about?!

1183
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:01,900
Even our documents have
begun to gather dust!

1184
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,400
lt's sheer nonsense!

1185
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:06,200
All that talk about rights and
justice is nothing but nonsense!

1186
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,900
There's only one law that prevails
out here... might is right!

1187
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:13,500
That's it! '' Might is Right'' !

1188
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,800
You're lucky that Katiya should
have had his eye on your shop.

1189
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:22,400
Had he eyed your wife,
you'd have deserted her, too.

1190
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,500
Aren't you ashamed to
talk like that?

1191
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,900
She's my wife...!
The honor of our home...

1192
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:31,600
- She's your sister-in-law!
- And this land is our Mother!

1193
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:35,800
will you abandon the land that
gave you your bread and better?

1194
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:39,000
The land, because of which
you got married...

1195
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:40,900
...and which helped you
bring up your son...

1196
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:42,800
...could you ever desert
such a piece of land?!

1197
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,400
lt's not a piece of mere land...
lt's your honor itself!

1198
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:49,100
lt's your self-respect, brother!

1199
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:51,500
And there's nothing more precious

1200
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,500
Nothing!

1201
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:12,800
l've made a vow.

1202
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:15,200
l'll die, but l won't leave my shop!

1203
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:16,900
But no one has taken your shop.

1204
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:20,200
lf you open your shop, all the...
other shops will be in trouble!

1205
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,800
Hey!...who's opening their shop?

1206
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:24,400
His shop.

1207
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:26,000
-Yes it's me who opened...
-what will you do about it?

1208
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,100
-Come in the middle.
-Start counting.

1209
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:33,000
One...two....three...four!

1210
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,100
-You hit first!
-No one will interfere!

1211
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:52,900
Today it will be you!

1212
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,700
l said no one will interfere!

1213
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,200
Hit me....l said hit me.

1214
01:49:57,700 --> 01:49:59,300
l'll take a lade.

1215
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,100
-Hey he's about to come.
-Close the shop.

1216
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:22,900
Nothing will happen.

1217
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:28,100
-where is he?....There he is!
-The rascal!

1218
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:29,400
He's come....see!

1219
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:41,300
See!

1220
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,600
You're for real!

1221
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:49,900
-Look Shiva. we understand.
-we understand everything.

1222
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:51,800
But tell us one thing.

1223
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:57,400
Us shopkeepers...will we run our...
business....or fight those thugs?

1224
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:01,300
Do you have other strong people...
in Benares Kashish?

1225
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:03,200
Bring 1 0-1 2 of them here.

1226
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:04,900
we'll give them what they want.

1227
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:07,100
Yes we'll give them a place to stay.

1228
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,900
we'll raise them.

1229
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,800
First you'll raise them...
Then when they become thugs?

1230
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:14,200
You'll raise thugs!

1231
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,100
we have to do what needs to be done!

1232
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,800
Nothing will go wrong for you.

1233
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:19,700
Your brother is a strong man.

1234
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,300
l don't even have a brother.

1235
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,500
Shiva...you fight.
Your shop will go.

1236
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,800
Dama Kaka...for us its no go.

1237
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,400
why won't you listen...
all of us will go together.

1238
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,800
-ls the shop running?
-Their all closed!

1239
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,000
we can't fight those thugs!

1240
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:35,200
-And the police won't listen to us!
-They will listen.

1241
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,200
The police will listen to you.

1242
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,300
They will have to listen.

1243
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,300
what will he do now?

1244
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,800
Yes l've sent the picture.

1245
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:49,800
Also have sent all the details.

1246
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:52,700
why won't you people understand...
she's my daughter!

1247
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,100
She's missing since noon..
no news as of yet!

1248
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:59,400
Barricade the city!

1249
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,600
Put the whole police force on this...
if needed!

1250
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:05,200
But l need my daughter back!

1251
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:10,500
what?...forget the commissioner...
l'll even talk to the minister!

1252
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,600
-what did they say?
-Keep calm.

1253
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:16,500
Nothing will happen to her...nothing.

1254
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,000
l'm really scared.

1255
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:23,000
This is all your fault!

1256
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:27,300
-lf anything happens to my daughter...
-Nothing will happen to her!

1257
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,900
She has died!

1258
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,100
-She's been murdered.
-what?

1259
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:36,500
The police does nothing without proof...

1260
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:38,500
Here take this.

1261
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:59,200
when did it happen? How did it happen?
who did it?

1262
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:01,600
Make an inquiry.

1263
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:05,000
-Have to make a case.
-we'll lnspector?

1264
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:10,500
who knows how many kids have...
died on the streets.

1265
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,100
who never had a case.

1266
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:18,300
And the ones who had a case...
Their file never got opened.

1267
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,100
You're kneeling after finding out..
your daughter's been murdered?

1268
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:26,400
The person you have made angry...
is the one who killed her.

1269
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:29,100
-But why kill her?
-why kill Pinky?

1270
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,700
what did she ever do to anyone!

1271
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:36,000
why?. The hand was cut off...

1272
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:38,400
...from the person who only...
wanted his right...why?

1273
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:44,900
His wife was killed at your police station...
She turned mad. then got no justice. why?

1274
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:52,100
A person is treated like a dog. made to..
look like a fool...why?

1275
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:58,200
People ask for their rights...
kneel before the authorities...

1276
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:05,700
...pay you bribes...they can't even eat..
why?. why?

1277
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,500
No telling how many people have suffered..
why?...why?

1278
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:19,000
why?...because the law and justice...
sit enslaved!

1279
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:22,300
And while all this happens...
this is the way it will be!

1280
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,600
You are responsible for this murder.

1281
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:32,300
An office as yourself make life difficult...
for a man.

1282
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:36,700
Your daughter has paid for you're...
misdeeds.

1283
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,900
why didn't l die before seeing..
all this!

1284
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:49,800
The death you want because of this...

1285
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,800
this is how we live day to day.

1286
01:54:57,700 --> 01:54:59,000
Pinky...take care of your father.

1287
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:12,000
wait Kashi.

1288
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,400
You did the right thing.

1289
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:20,700
This was the way to convince me.

1290
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:24,300
l'll fight with you.

1291
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:26,800
whether l keep my job or not.

1292
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:29,600
-whether l die or not...
-l promise you...

1293
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:32,400
Katiya cannot remove you from the land.

1294
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:39,200
Hey...look at him.

1295
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,400
Greetings.

1296
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:48,000
lnspector...as you know...
yes its Shiv Rath.

1297
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:54,200
Yes it is Shiv Rath...but we are...
going crazy because of the shops.

1298
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,400
This is all because of the lnspector.

1299
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:59,200
lt's not because of me...
but because of Bhole-Nath.

1300
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:02,600
He has sent Kashi as our savior.

1301
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,700
Sir, tomorrow we are starting our...
business.

1302
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:06,800
-lt will be calm won't it?
-Of course it will.

1303
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:08,900
within 2-3 days a new police station...
will open here.

1304
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:10,400
This is why l'm going to Delhi.

1305
01:56:10,700 --> 01:56:13,400
And l promise you, Katiya and all...
his men will be arrested.

1306
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:15,400
Now you will have to take blessing's.

1307
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:17,500
At night we have planned a religious...
function.

1308
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:19,400
l want you to come for sure.

1309
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:20,600
we will a lot of fun and play.

1310
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,300
A religious function with fun and play?

1311
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:24,200
Here take this.

1312
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:26,600
Here are some passes that were forgotten...
at the police station.

1313
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:29,300
A new club is opening...Go there...
and have fun and frolic!

1314
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,100
OK l'm going.

1315
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:35,900
Goodbye.

1316
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:49,700
-wow...That was fun.
-The dance was great!

1317
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:50,900
where did they go?

1318
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:53,400
Hey Dhamoo-Kaka...come here!

1319
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:55,600
Everything will be OK.

1320
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:58,800
Be calm...all will be fine.

1321
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:17,700
what happened is terrible.

1322
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:21,400
Katiya is very hurt because of this.

1323
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,900
Because of this, he has come...
to meet you himself.

1324
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:32,600
People will talk...

1325
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:36,400
...that Katiya has done this deed.

1326
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:43,200
But everyone knows, that whatever...
Katiya does...

1327
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:46,000
...he does it openly.

1328
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:51,400
He does in front of everyone.

1329
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:55,200
And does in broad daylight.

1330
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,900
This is a fatal incident...

1331
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,500
Dead people will get RS.20,000...

1332
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,200
...and injured people...Rs 1 0,000.

1333
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:08,100
l give right now.

1334
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,300
Not 2 years later as the government does.

1335
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:12,600
And another thing...

1336
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:16,100
you never know when death may grip you.

1337
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:18,700
This know one knows.

1338
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:21,500
Those who are living...

1339
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:24,300
should remember this!

1340
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:29,500
That this incident could happen to...
them as well.

1341
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:32,600
Let's go.

1342
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:18,400
Let me go!

1343
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:33,400
-Let me go!
-Bastard!

1344
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:35,800
You dare lay your hands on Katiya!

1345
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:38,600
Lay my hands?...l'll pull your heart...
out you bastard!

1346
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:40,500
You dare lay your hands on my brother!

1347
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:42,300
l'll bash you over and over!

1348
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:43,900
l'll bash you over and over!

1349
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:46,100
l'll tear you apart you bastard!

1350
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:48,000
l swear, by tomorrow sunrise...

1351
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:51,500
forget tomorrow...l'll burn now!

1352
02:06:51,700 --> 02:06:53,700
You'll burn me alive?

1353
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
-Come on..Let's go...
-Let the bastard go!

1354
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:00,500
lf all 7 of you are of one father...

1355
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,800
l swear upon the Ganges...

1356
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,700
l will kill you in your own house!

1357
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,600
l'll kill all 7 of you...all 7!

1358
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:10,800
-Stop!
-l made your father a dog!

1359
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:12,500
You also...

1360
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:01,000
-Here...
-wash your face brother in law.

1361
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:03,200
The dirt will come off from...
this hot water.

1362
02:08:03,700 --> 02:08:05,400
But the disgrace that's on your face...

1363
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:09,000
-The disgrace will be washed by blood!
-Kashi's blood!

1364
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:10,800
l need his blood!....His blood!

1365
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:18,300
No telling which mole Kashi...
is hiding in.

1366
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:20,500
Looks like he ran back to Benares.

1367
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:22,500
we'll look here.

1368
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:29,200
what happened?

1369
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:31,300
who did all this?

1370
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:43,700
After l swore to kill all 7 of you...
together...

1371
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:46,700
...all 7 of you started wandering...
separately.

1372
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Not wandering separately...

1373
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:51,200
...but looking for you as your death!

1374
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:53,800
Death is awaiting you here.

1375
02:08:57,300 --> 02:09:00,400
Talk...want to die alone...
or with your brothers?

1376
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,200
Tear him apart!

1377
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:40,000
why are you all ashamed?

1378
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:41,200
Drink!

1379
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:42,800
This is Anthes party.

1380
02:10:43,200 --> 02:10:45,100
He loves throwing a party.

1381
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:48,300
He loves wining and dining people.

1382
02:10:48,900 --> 02:10:49,900
Go ahead and drink.

1383
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:53,400
lf you won't drink...Anthe will...
not like it.

1384
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:55,200
Drink!

1385
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:59,800
Hey Anthe, everyone is at your party...
but no one is wining and dining.

1386
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:01,900
You tell them.

1387
02:11:02,500 --> 02:11:03,800
They will listen to you.

1388
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:05,900
Just like you listen to me.

1389
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:11,900
He's a good brother.

1390
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:13,700
A very good brother.

1391
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:15,600
He respects me very much.

1392
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:17,100
Listens to me.

1393
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:19,200
Does not do anything...

1394
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:20,600
...without asking me.

1395
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:22,200
But today!

1396
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:24,900
But today...he's died without...
asking me.

1397
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,700
Died like a dog.

1398
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,500
Now what do l do with you?

1399
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,800
Burn!

1400
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:42,000
-This is what was your fate!
-Burn!

1401
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:46,000
Didn't you think of me before dying?

1402
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:50,200
Didn't you think of how l would feel?

1403
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:53,100
You should have asked me!

1404
02:11:53,800 --> 02:11:55,500
l wouldn't have let you die!

1405
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:29,600
Katiya has said...

1406
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:33,000
if anyone helps in lifting this...
dead body...

1407
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:37,200
his whole family won't be spared.

1408
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:39,700
Call the municipality to lift his body.

1409
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:36,600
4 men please step forward...

1410
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:38,100
lt's time to give shoulder to...
the body.

1411
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:47,700
Please 4 people step up, it's time...
to lift the body.

1412
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:02,400
Panditji, according to the rituals...

1413
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:04,900
four men are needed.

1414
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:08,300
There are no men left here.

1415
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:12,300
There are no men left here!

1416
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:14,300
They have all died!

1417
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:17,300
No one can do anything!

1418
02:14:24,200 --> 02:14:26,800
You will have to do this alone.

1419
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,300
All alone.

1420
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:33,800
l don't need four men!

1421
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,700
Kashi is sufficient to lift my body!

1422
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:23,500
Boss, Kashinath will seek police...
protection when he spreads the ashes.

1423
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
lf you say so...

1424
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,200
Take the handcuffs off Kashi!

1425
02:17:28,300 --> 02:17:30,700
Hey...Kill the bastard!

1426
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:18,200
Look...lssue an arrest warrant on Katya...
and all his brothers.

1427
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,400
Him, all his thugs, immediately!

1428
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:30,400
Not the police...

1429
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,300
Not the police...

1430
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:37,700
lf you want to help....
don't interfere.

1431
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:41,100
Keep away from this fight.

1432
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:42,900
Kashi, those people have gone mad!

1433
02:20:43,300 --> 02:20:47,900
They kidnapped the boy by hiding in..
your house!

1434
02:20:48,300 --> 02:20:49,800
l don't know...
All they can do is kill him!

1435
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:51,600
Let him die!

1436
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:53,700
But Kashi...
They will kill the shopkeepers...

1437
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:55,700
Let them die as well.

1438
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:58,900
But now l don't need the police.

1439
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,900
The one who will survive...
will be the one who is self sufficient.

1440
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:05,600
Not by the crutches of the police...

1441
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:09,000
ln this either we will win...

1442
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:10,600
...or we will have a clear loss.

1443
02:21:11,800 --> 02:21:13,900
Those who have guts...

1444
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:16,200
will be the victors.

1445
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:18,100
He will live who deserves too.

1446
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:33,200
where's the boy?

1447
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:46,300
Uncle!

1448
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:27,500
Uncle!

1449
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:50,300
Don't beat my uncle!

1450
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:11,500
You didn't do good Kashinath.

1451
02:26:12,300 --> 02:26:13,000
Not right.

1452
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:17,700
The day l gained conscience...

1453
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:20,400
l never cried.

1454
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:23,400
But now you've made me cry.

1455
02:26:24,400 --> 02:26:29,400
First you hurt me, then you put...
salt on my wounds.

1456
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:32,300
You didn't do right.

1457
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:37,100
Takes a long time...

1458
02:26:38,600 --> 02:26:40,500
to put fear into a person.

1459
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,500
My life has now gone...

1460
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:46,700
...but not you!

1461
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:55,100
we were seven brothers.

1462
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:59,300
All of us lions.

1463
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:05,100
Out of which you killed four.

1464
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:07,200
Not four but five.

1465
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:16,500
wait!

1466
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:18,900
what are you doing?

1467
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:23,400
lf you kill him, they will make...
a statue of him.

1468
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:25,700
People will worship him!

1469
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:29,300
Kill those who revere him!

1470
02:27:29,700 --> 02:27:32,700
So people will once again fear you!

1471
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:35,600
Keep quite kid!....

1472
02:27:36,300 --> 02:27:37,200
Quite!

1473
02:27:38,300 --> 02:27:40,200
This is the first time you've talked...
sensible.

1474
02:27:48,700 --> 02:27:52,800
You will receive peace in your soul soon.

1475
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:56,500
And my vow will soon come true.

1476
02:27:57,700 --> 02:28:00,000
The vow your brother took upon...
your death.

1477
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:05,000
That while l don't take care...
