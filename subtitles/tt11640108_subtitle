Your activities are all weird.

5
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:34,833
Strangers are calling you by different names.

Noticed your concern for others
which others don't possess.

00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,042
Arvind...

103
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,292
Actually your name is not in the list.

104
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:23,833
Can I see your file?

105
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:24,958

Have you come to an interview without a file.

00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,125
You mean interview?

00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,083

00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,000
Are you Lakshmi?

00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,333

112
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,042
I have come to see my bride.

113
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:38,708
What?

114
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:40,250
Do you know who am I?

115
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,208
Yes am aware.

116
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:46,083
Three manufacturing units in 1400 acres.

118
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:54,000
You are the Chair person for the
estate, factory and company.

119
00:15:54,375 --> 00:16:00,083
Business Today magazine offered you the
"The Best Business woman Award" in 2018.

120
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,792
You are the heir to the 136 years
traditional fortune.

121
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:08,583
Your net asset... 968 Crores.

122
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,167
But inspite of all these....

123
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:12,417
Your life is filled with sadness.

124
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:15,583
Because you lost your
husband two years back.

125
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,167
Only now you are recovering slowly.

126
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,042
I saw an advertisement that a well educated..

127
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:27,792
..single mother needs a groom and applied.

128
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,542
I have been asked to come here
for a personal interaction.

129
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,208
If you still don't trust me..

130
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:34,708
Have a look at the invitation mail you sent.

131
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,458
Sorry Mr.Arvind.

132
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,375
A small misunderstanding.

133
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,875
I thought you are here for the Manager interview.

134
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:47,625
Why don't you tell him?

135
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,667
Yeah... We thought so..

136
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,708
Someone from my family should have given
this advertisement without my knowledge.

137
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:54,792
I am not aware of it.

138
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,792
Sorry for unnecessarily bothering you.

139
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,792
Daisy..
Yes Mam.

140
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,583
Please check on his to and fro expenses
and settle him.

141
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,083
Okay Mam.

142
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,667
By paying me are you trying to show off
that you are a big shot.

143
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,875
No.. not at all.

144
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,583
Then what?

145
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:13,167
Trying to cover your mistake through money..

146
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:14,750
I didn't mean that way.

147
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:15,667
Looks like that only.

148
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,458
If you really want to help out..

149
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,542
A lady is sitting with a baby outside..

150
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,375
Roopa..

151
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,833
Yes.. Roopa..

152
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,708
Give her this job.

153
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,167
She possess all the qualities you expect.

154
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,542
Moreover she is a widow and
a single mother.

155
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,125
I think she rightly deserves it.

156
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:34,667
Definitely.

157
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,125
Thank you.

158
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:00,250
Nithya...

159
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:03,583
Nithya..

160
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,000
Where is Nithya?

161
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:07,833
I don't know madam.

162
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:10,542
Where is Nithya?

163
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,833
She is in the garden Mam.

164
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:13,292
(Talking over phone)
Hey Sidhu..

165
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,792
Why didn't you pick my call?

166
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:15,958
Got too much boozed at the party is it ?

167
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:16,958
Aaa
(Shouts in pain)

168
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,000
With whose permission you gave
advertisement in the matrimony.

169
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,375
When I was interviewing someone he is telling me.

170
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,250
He had come to check on his bride..

171
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,083
You know.. I felt so embarrassed...

172
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:25,583
Shit..

173
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,042
What is there to get ashamed sister?

174
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,542
He is 5.10" tall.

175
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:29,958
V shaped body,

176
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,375
brown eyes, zodiac sign is Leo.

177
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,917
Macho.

178
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,208
..looked like a model.

179
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,208
That's why I asked him to come.

180
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:37,583
If you like him, get married.

181
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,542
I can't imagine anyone in the place of Ashok.

182
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:44,292
No chance!

183
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,083
Think logically.

184
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,417
After my marriage with Sidhu..
I will go to USA with him.

185
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,125
Then you will be left alone with the kid..

186
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,500
That's very painful.

187
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,250
You are still young..
you are not a piece of wood.

188
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:03,083
You need someone to talk, to cry, to share.

189
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:06,958
I think Arvind will take care
of you both well.

190
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,167
Please marry him Lakshmi.

191
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,250
Leave that... where's baby?

192
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:30,833
boo...

193
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,792
Mummy..

194
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,792
Come here my darling

195
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,583
This looks colourful and beautiful..

196
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,792
Shall we play with this?

197
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:39,750
Mmm.

198
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,583
(Mobile ringing..)

199
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,917
What happened? Any luck?

200
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,333
No.. My plan did not work

201
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,917
Idiot..
Are you not ashamed to tell this ?

202
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,167
Wait

203
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,125
What if Plan A fails.

204
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,917
I have got Plan B

205
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:01,583
Look..

206
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,875
I don't care if you join as a Security at her factory..

207
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,583
or become her driver..

208
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't care about it

209
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,833
Get close to Lakshmi..

210
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,667
My plan should work out

211
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:12,708
Or else..

212
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,708
you will suffer in your entire life..

213
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:15,792
Got it

214
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,333
All of you will hide now..

215
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,042
Okay

216
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,542
Don't come out.
Mmm..

217
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,250
Yes.. Yes..
Okay..

218
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,667
Alright... Are you ready?

219
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:37,542
Ok

220
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,000
Lets close the eyes...
Mmm..

221
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,125
1...

222
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,375
2...

223
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,250
3...

224
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,000
4...

225
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,583
5..

226
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,458
Now open your eyes... Go

227
00:20:56,167 --> 00:21:00,458
(Mobile ringing...)

228
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,333
Hello...

229
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,667
Mmm...

230
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,042
Mummy...

231
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:44,167
Mitoo..

232
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:45,917
Nithya..

233
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,333
Did you see Mitoo?

234
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,708
No... What happened?

235
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,333
Mam...
She was playing here only

236
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,333
(A voice screaming....
Someones child has fallen in the water...)

237
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:54,083
Mitoo...

238
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,042
Mitoo...

239
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,542
Mitoo...
move aside...

240
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,833
Mitoo... What happened?

241
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:31,708
Don't be scared..

242
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:32,875
Doctor is checking the baby..

243
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,250
She will be fine

244
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,583
Be strong

245
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,125
Doctor.. How's the child?
Is she alright...?

246
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,792
Don't worry..
She is out of danger now

247
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,125
Thank you Doctor

248
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,458
Hello..

249
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:18,250
Hi

250
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,667
I can't find ways to thank you

251
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,708
You haven't saved one life...

252
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,125
You have saved two lives

253
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:27,375
I will never forget this throughout my life

254
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,833
You haven't left for Mumbai

255
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,125
When I saw you in the matrimony site..

256
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,250
I liked you at the very first sight

257
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,708
I was refusing to get married even
when everyone forced me

258
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:46,708
My mother's last wish was that I get married and settle.

259
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,042
That didn't happen

260
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,792
So thought to stay at this place for another two days

261
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:56,167
The beauty of this Ooty, has brought a change within me

262
00:23:57,042 --> 00:24:00,125
Just got a small idea to seek a job here and stay here

263
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:01,958
Why do you have to look for a job elsewhere..

264
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,125
There's a Manager post vacant at my factory

265
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:05,583
I can give it to you

266
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:07,583
You can stay at the factory guest house

267
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,250
But one thing..

268
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,833
The job doesn't match to your qualification

269
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,167
Think and tell me

270
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,417
What's there to think?

271
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:15,792
I will accept it

272
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:20,708
As long as I am here.. will be loyal and take care

273
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,333
What?

274
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,042
I was talking about the factory

275
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,000
He is Mr. Arvind

276
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:32,167
Few will have qualification and few possess sincerity.

277
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:35,583
But only few will possess Humanity

278
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:38,000
He has got all the three.

279
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,375
That's why I have appointed him here as a Manager.

280
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:43,542
Congrats Sir ...
Thank you

281
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,792
Everyone..

282
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:46,792
Please extend your maximum co-operation.

283
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:48,250
Okay
Yes mam

284
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,167
Thank you

285
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:50,125
You can get back to work

286
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,125
Yes Mam

287
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:55,167
She is Daisy.. My Secretary

288
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:55,917
Hi sir
Hi

289
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:58,375
Madam... May I collect the certificates
and other details from him

290
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:01,667
Sorry... I did not come here with a job intention..

291
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,917
If its mandatory give me ten days time.

292
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:05,833
I will submit and then join...

293
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:08,125
No.. No.. Those are just formalities..

294
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,792
That's ok... No need

295
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:11,708
Daisy... Show him his cabin

296
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:12,542
Yes Mam

297
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:13,583
Thank you

298
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,667
Hey.. Relax.. Relax..

299
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:53,958
I...

300
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:57,625
How did I come here..?

301
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:00,542
Who are you?

302
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:01,958
I am Subhadra

303
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,708
Don't worry.. You are safe

304
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:06,292
Your name?

305
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:09,833
I am Arvind

306
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:11,208
Arvind...

307
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:14,500
You met with a car accident and was unconscious

308
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:17,875
I accidentally passed by that side and saved you

309
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:21,250
But the cab driver died at the spot.

310
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:25,167
I could not find any of your details there

311
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:30,417
Your suitcase was broken and there were lots of cash and jewels in it.

312
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,917
Instead of going to Police or hospital, I found my home safe

313
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,208
I brought you here and gave you enough medical assistance

314
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:41,292
Dont worry ...

315
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:42,667
I was a medical student

316
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,750
Do you know something.. it's been 12 days since you are here

317
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,542
But now you are perfectly alright

318
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:52,167
Thanks a lot

319
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,000
You did the right thing

320
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,375
I will never forget you in my life

321
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,167
I need to get dressed.

322
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,042
Please..

323
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:00,292
Thank you..

324
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:07,542
Arvind..

325
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:11,167
Please check if your jewels and money are correct

326
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:14,458
When I was battling for my life.

327
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,000
You don't even know me..

328
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,333
You saved me and took good care of me till now..

329
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:19,958
How can I suspect you?

330
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,458
It should be fine

331
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:22,917
Once again..

332
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,083
Thank you so much

333
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:25,667
Okay..

334
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,125
I am leaving..

335
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:36,042
Arvind..

336
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:38,458
When you go outside..

337
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,125
What will you do when Police catches you?

338
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,292
Why will Police catch me?

339
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:47,292
While the whole world was celebrating the New year..

340
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,458
..you were murdering your family.

341
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:51,667
When you murder someone, won't they arrest you ?

342
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:55,208
Do you expect a Padmasri !

343
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,500
I think you have misunderstood something

344
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Is that so... dear?

345
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,375
Just open the window and see for yourself

346
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:16,708
That's your house, which you blasted..

347
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:21,000
I am your neighbour for the last two years

348
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:26,708
Your wife Jessy and her children know me better

349
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,917
When I met Jessy at a shopping mall ..

350
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,333
She showed me your photo and
told me that she got remarried

351
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:36,250
She told me you are handicap
but a very nice person

352
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:39,125
One day

353
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,583
When you were alone in your terrace..

354
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:42,792
I saw you walking normally..
When you were alone in your terrace..

355
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:59,875
Why should you pretend like a
handicap to your family?

356
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:01,333
That's when..

357
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:04,625
I started having my doubts on you

358
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,458
I thought you might be planning something

359
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,083
From then onwards..

360
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:12,417
I started following you 24/7

361
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:17,208
As I inferred...
you committed a big crime on 31st

362
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,792
Help.. Help.. Help..

363
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:20,958
Someone save us please...

364
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,875
I don't care about your flashback

365
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,750
I don't think you are a first time murderer..

366
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,292
Looks like your killing is your profession

367
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,417
I could have informed the Police immediately..

368
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,625
But I didn't do it

369
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:14,708
You know why ?

370
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,125
Because I was looking for someone like you..

371
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,167
I need you

372
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,958
Attractive personality with criminal brain.

373
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:25,708
(Smirking..)
You know...

374
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:31,958
I have saved your criminal action in a small memory card
and kept it in a safe place.

375
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,792
If you do what I say ...

376
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:35,917
I shall return it to you..

377
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,458
If you deny.. I shall hand it over to Police.

378
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:42,583
Your destiny lies in your hands

379
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,208
Choose wise !

380
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:56,708
What should I do now?

381
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,417
This is Lakshmi.. my elder sister

382
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,792
This is Nithya.. my younger sister

383
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:08,042
This little one is Lakshmi's daughter

384
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,708
We are one of the richest families in Ooty.

385
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:16,083
Lakshmi Tea estates, Ashok Exports, Nithya Resorts etc etc...

386
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,625
We got plenty of assets

387
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,833
Lakshmi is the Managing Director for everything.

388
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,292
She's a very nice person, but strict

389
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:26,792
For 24hrs she is into estate, factory, workers, family..

390
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:27,917
That's her life.

391
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:29,625
She doesn't know the outside world.

392
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,667
But I am not like that

393
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:34,833
I wish to fly around the world like a free bird
and be happy..

394
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,458
I am just opposite to Lakshmi

395
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:41,375
I came to Mumbai once I got the
medical admission..

396
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,583
My lifestyle changed then..

397
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:46,375
I lived my life as I wanted..

398
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:48,792
Boy friends, parties, sex, drugs..

399
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,708
I was enjoying my life dude

400
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,250
My dad didn't like this

401
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:56,042
He tried to change me... but in vain

402
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,542
Out of his hatred towards me

403
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,708
On his deathbed..

404
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,917
..he made Lakshmi as the legal heir for all his assets
and passed away

405
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,250
I asked my share to Lakshmi..

406
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,458
I cried, begged then even faced her legally

407
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:10,750
But nothing happened

408
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:15,375
She told me to settle in Ooty and
she will take care of me well

409
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,583
But I didn't accept it and came down to Goa

410
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:21,333
Now she is giving One Lakh per month
as if I am a beggar

411
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:22,667
Bloody bitch...

412
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,333
I have no contacts with her for the past
one and a half year

413
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,667
Only planning..

414
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,292
I have to acquire it completely..

415
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,083
I am a Bad Boy..

416
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,917
I'm a bad Boy..

417
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:58,708
What are you ?
Driver or Security?

418
00:32:59,083 --> 00:32:59,917
Factory Manager

419
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:00,667
(laughs)

420
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,125
Oh Congrats..

421
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:06,708
Complete your task and
come out of it soon...

422
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:08,000
Else...

423
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,125
Police will come in search of you there..

424
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,792
Blackmail.. Blackmail... Blackmail !

425
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:12,792
You are torturing me..

426
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:14,792
We are going to execute a big task

427
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:16,458
I have just joined ...

428
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:18,417
I need some time.

429
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,292
(Laughs) Okay My Slave..

430
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,500
Take your time..

431
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,458
Bye...

432
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,000
I am a bad boy

433
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,375
I don't pity anyone...

434
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:30,833
I am addicted to money...

435
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:34,667
My desires are to be fulfilled

436
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:37,958
Fear is your enemy...

437
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,458
Rules are bad routes...

438
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,375
Killing is not an offense...

439
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,500
It's just a gambling

440
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:54,750
...and start the hunt in and out

441
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:56,875
I conquer what I see...

442
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:59,083
I aquire what I touch...

443
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:01,542
My technology is unbeatable...

444
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,042
and I fool around with Interpol...

445
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:07,792
I fool around

446
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:12,875
I fool around..

447
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,292
Scoundrel.. How dare you misbehave with
your colleague..

448
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,833
Get lost

449
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:25,208
Should have chopped his hands..

450
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:27,500
Then only he will never desire
to touch any other woman..

451
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:30,542
That girls life is also involved in this..
That's why I left him

452
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:32,375
You are too kind hearted

453
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,958
Who is he...

454
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:37,792
Sneaked in like a smoke...

455
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:40,042
Who is he...

456
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,958
An unanswered puzzle...

457
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,417
Touches me like a breeze...

458
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:52,167
He leaves behind mysterious silence.

459
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,500
He becomes my time in clock...

460
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:56,875
.. and a tea to quench my thirst

461
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,750
Near or far making my heart
a search engine

462
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:03,625
Usha..
Mam

463
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:04,958
Take these clothes for washing
Yes Mam

464
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,208
I am a Bad boy

465
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:09,583
Subhadra..

466
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:12,792
Lakshmi goes with her entire family to Masangudi.
for every weekend

467
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,458
She stays there for two days...

468
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
There's no security at the Guest House..

469
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,792
Better finish them all there itself

470
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,208
I am a bad boy

471
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:41,042
(Sobbing)
My son was the bread winner of our family..

472
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,583
He had left us in this old age.

473
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,583
His limbs and legs were lying separately..

474
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,833
We had to pick them madam...

475
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,500
I am there for you...

476
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,250
I will take care of your family..

477
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:56,958
Excuse me Mam...

478
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,958
Can I know what is this Cheque for?

479
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,250
Four days before...

480
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,792
Our estate worker, Suri got killed by a Tiger

481
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:08,583
This cheque is a compensation to their family.

482
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,292
So...

483
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,917
Ten Lakh rupees is the cost of a life
at your estate.

484
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,167
You can get away everything with money..
is it?

485
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:16,958
Can we get back a lost life ?

486
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,375
Tiger will only come back ..

487
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,958
And people will keep dying.

488
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:25,000
Every month one or two deaths like this
keep happening. So..what?

489
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,875
Do we have to run away fearing the beast?

490
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,417
Have any one of you lost your family member
to a Tiger?

491
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:30,167
No...

492
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,292
In your families?

493
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,417
No Sir.

494
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:34,375
That's why you don't know its pain.

495
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,167
What can we do about it Arvind..?

496
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:37,167
It's an accident !

497
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,167
Yes it's an accident !

498
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:42,583
To lose my family and child in front
of my eyes in an accident...

499
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,167
To weep..

500
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,708
And to lead a life with that pain...

501
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:50,417
That pain tears my heart into pieces

502
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,292
Only when you lose...

503
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:53,792
...you will realize its pain

504
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,542
Money is not the right way to compensate a lost life..

505
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:03,667
The right way to compensate is to prevent
from losing another life

506
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:11,000
Have you taken any steps
to catch that tiger?

507
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,708
Yes..
We tried.

508
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,083
We put fences,

509
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:16,375
Kept a cage with a goat, cow... as a prey

510
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:17,333
But its not getting trapped

511
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,833
It needs only human lives

512
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,792
That which tastes human life becomes a man eater

513
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,583
You cannot catch it that easily

514
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:29,250
Should we spare a human life inside the cage to catch it?

515
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:29,917
No..

516
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:33,708
Along with meat we can place a
dummy man inside the cage

517
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,083
In an estate if the buffer zone ...

518
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,625
..where the tiger wanders is more than 50 km radius..

519
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,375
..we can set up an high voltage electric fence..

520
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:44,583
..camera traps, CCTV, thermal imagery drones,

521
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:45,917
..civetone perfumes..

522
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,917
We can try many methods like this.

523
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,167
Moreover..

524
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,583
No one should be allowed go to the forest alone

525
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,792
If you have to go,

526
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:56,000
You will have to use the mini bus
accompanied with an armed guard

527
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,833
We should not lose another life in this estate

528
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:04,417
Arvind..

529
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,958
Start executing this immediately..

530
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:07,792
I will support you

531
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:10,833
Thank you mam

532
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:27,458
How did you enter my heart...

533
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:30,833
My soul is getting melted...

534
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:35,417
When I touch the fire...

535
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:39,167
I feel your touch...

536
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:44,958
At your first look...

537
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:53,375
Felt like honey spilled...

538
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:57,167
I don't feel myself
wondering how ?

539
00:38:57,583 --> 00:39:01,167
How did you enter my heart...

540
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,042
My soul is getting melted...

541
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:09,917
How did you enter my heart...

542
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:17,167
You told me that you will know the pain
only when you lose

543
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:20,500
I have undergone that pain

544
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,708
We have travelled in the same boat..

545
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:25,792
Loss...

546
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,917
...is our common factor

547
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:33,083
A very happy past,

548
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:37,042
unhappy present..

549
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:42,583
If it had not been for my sister and child..
I would have ..

550
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,375
The moments I spent with you ..

551
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:49,417
..gave me the desire to live me life again

552
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:53,708
The person standing in front of me, Arvind..

553
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,792
...seems like the life, God is restoring on me.

554
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:01,083
I think ..

555
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,083
I am in love with you.

556
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:07,167
Shall we get married, Arvind?

557
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:14,958
Am getting back my life..
Don't get away from me...

558
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,917
My heart dances like a peacock ...

559
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,958
Hug me always and don't leave me...

560
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:31,042
When we bud within each other...
Won't the monsoon shower...

561
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:35,083
My lust won't last without your kiss...

562
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:39,083
Let this night continue...

563
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:45,792
You exceeded first...

564
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:52,833
Tickled the petals....

565
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:57,083
I am not myself...

566
00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:00,833
How did you enter my heart...

567
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,792
It melts deep into my soul...

568
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:08,958
When I touch the fire...

569
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:12,625
I feel your touch...

570
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:19,167
For the first time you seem everything to me...

571
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:25,000
I smell pure blossom...

572
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:28,500
I am not myself...

573
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:30,042
There's a good news for you.

574
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:32,167
I got married to Lakshmi

575
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:33,375
That's a good news for you.

576
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:34,375
Not for me..

577
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:36,167
I need money

578
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,625
Or else their death

579
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:40,542
That's good news to me

580
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:41,917
When can I hear that?

581
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,167
Be patient...

582
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:44,250
Don't be in a hurry!

583
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,250
Be patient, wait...

584
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,292
You have been telling this for months..

585
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:49,917
Do you think am stupid !

586
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:52,083
Since you got married to a millionaire..

587
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,250
Don't reckon to settle and
try to change your track

588
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:56,042
Subhadra...

589
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:56,917
What?

590
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:58,375
Don't raise your voice.

591
00:41:58,792 --> 00:41:59,292
Look ..

592
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,833
You have got just a month's time..

593
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,042
If you don't finish them..

594
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:03,833
I will finish you !

595
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:05,958
Shit !

596
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,417
First listen to me..

597
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:18,833
(Talking over phone)
What?

598
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,917
Hey don't keep talking..

599
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:55,083
Help me...

600
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:57,583
Help me...

601
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:31,375
(crying in pain)

602
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,625
(telephone ringing)

603
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,042
Hello...

604
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:42,917
I am Thangaiah...

605
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,375
Suresh..

606
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:45,917
I got caught with the tiger..

607
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:46,917
Oh my God..
Where are you ?

608
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,917
I am Inside vattaparai jungle

609
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,083
Please send someone and save me

610
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:52,042
Sir..

611
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,417
Sir..

612
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:54,375
Sir..

613
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:56,083
What happened?

614
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,292
Thangaiah got stuck with the Tiger

615
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,375
Ram, Veera... come to the jeep

616
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,292
Inform Thangaiah that we are coming

617
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:04,083
Ok Sir

618
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,500
Get the weapons ready..

619
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,792
Inform the forest department

620
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:10,792
Quickly
okay Sir

621
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:12,375
Arvind... What happened?

622
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:13,917
Our estate worker, Thangaiah got caught
with the Tiger..

623
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:14,750
Have to go immediately

624
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:15,917
Let them go..

625
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:16,583
They will handle

626
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:17,667
They can't do it alone..

627
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:18,583
Don't go Arvind

628
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:19,500
Please listen to me.

629
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,167
Arvind...

630
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:28,500
Are the three guns ready?

631
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,083
Yes sir

632
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,292
Check if the tranquilizers are ready

633
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,083
Yes sir

634
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:33,917
Sir ...

635
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:35,500
Sir ...
I am here..

636
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,292
come here sir..
Look there

637
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:53,583
Sir...

638
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:55,625
Fast..

639
00:45:59,292 --> 00:45:59,875
Careful !

640
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,917
Sir... Tiger is coming

641
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:04,500
Sir.. run away..

642
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:28,167
You never listen to me..

643
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,625
Why do you risk your life so much ?

644
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:31,292
You are not aware of Tiger habits..

645
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,417
Even trained hunters fail to catch it

646
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:34,208
Why did you go?

647
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,083
If I hadn't gone..

648
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,083
No one would have tried to save Thangaiah

649
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:39,667
We would have heard a news that
he got killed by a Tiger

650
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,083
How much protection work is completed?

651
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,708
North side 60% work completed ,
south side just started

652
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:46,958
Yes.. If you work in this pace..
Before fencing is done..

653
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:49,208
Another ten people got killed will be the breaking news

654
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:51,083
Please increase the man power

655
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,958
Place automatic cages on all sides

656
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:55,917
We have bought wifi connectivity drones..

657
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,083
Why haven't you installed it yet?

658
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:59,792
If you had installed it ...
We could have avoided this incident

659
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:01,583
Leave it ...

660
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:02,375
I will take care

661
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:07,083
In case we have to lose another life in this estate..

662
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,792
It should be my life!

663
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
(Subhadra calling on phone)

664
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,042
Shit

665
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:01,083
When you spoke today at the factory..

666
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,625
I could witness hope in everyone's face

667
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,042
You value life so much

668
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:09,625
You are panicking..

669
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:11,917
So that you don't lose a life

670
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:14,833
I feel proud about you

671
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:17,375
At the same time...

672
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,292
I am worried if I will miss you

673
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:27,167
I don't have the strength to bear
another loss.. Arvind

674
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:29,042
Hey.. Don't be afraid...

675
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,917
Nothing will happen as per your instinct

676
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,958
It's done madam..
It's in the car

677
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,542
Okay...

678
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,917
(Ploughing the soil)

679
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:21,458
Hey.. Nithya..
Yeah

680
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:23,750
Yesterday auditor handed me some cash.
Mmm..

681
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:25,375
I left it in the car

682
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:26,500
Oh God.. then..

683
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:27,917
Thank God.

684
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,458
I suddenly remembered by midnight..

685
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,542
When Arvind was sleeping ..
I kept it in the basement.

686
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:33,792
How much is the value?

687
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:35,958
He told me Ten Crores.

688
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:37,208
I haven't counted it yet.

689
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:40,708
Let Arvind leave to office.. we shall count then

690
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:41,500
Alright.

691
00:54:45,417 --> 00:54:46,458
Hi uncle...

692
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:48,667
You're looking dull..

693
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:49,708
Are you not feeling well.

694
00:54:58,208 --> 00:54:59,833
Hey.. what happened dear?

695
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:02,250
Hope your health is fine.

696
00:55:02,542 --> 00:55:03,833
Shall I call the doctor?

697
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,042
I am Okay.

698
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:06,583
A small issue running in my mind.

699
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,958
Hence feeling disturbed.

700
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:11,042
Any issues at the office?

701
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:17,458
My friend Shakthi needs to pay 50 Lakhs by today
for his sister's medical admission..

702
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:18,667
He asked for my help.

703
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:19,958
Who's this friend of yours?

704
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,167
He's my college mate.

705
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:24,875
If we give him by today it would
be a timely help.

706
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:26,625
He will return it in a week's time.

707
00:55:27,542 --> 00:55:28,292
Can you help?

708
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,625
50 lakhs?

709
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,292
No Arvind.

710
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,042
I don't keep so much cash in hand.

711
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,292
We keep liquid cash up to two Lakhs only!

712
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,500
My friend is stupid.

713
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,833
I am a very normal guy.

714
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,750
Since I got married to a millionaire like you..
He thought I am a big guy.

715
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,333
It's not his mistake.

716
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,792
I am a manager during the day,

717
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:49,250
..your husband at night,

718
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:51,042
..a bodyguard to your sister,

719
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:52,708
..and a driver to the kid.

720
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:56,375
Only am aware that am serving
as an unpaid servant.

721
00:55:56,417 --> 00:55:56,958
Arvind...

722
00:55:57,292 --> 00:55:58,292
What are you talking?

723
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,958
I just meant that I don't have cash in hand.

724
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:04,417
I didn't refuse to give or pay the fees.

725
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:07,792
Ask him to share that girl's name,
college details and bank details.

726
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:09,458
We will transfer immediately.

727
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:11,542
None of the colleges account the donation money.

728
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,875
If you don't wish to help
say it upfront.

729
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:15,625
Don't insult me!

730
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:18,667
Arvind.

731
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:20,833
Arvind

732
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,250
You are doing a mistake.

733
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,083
Money is never an issue to us.

734
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:28,292
50 lakhs!

735
00:56:28,917 --> 00:56:30,042
He only asked as a loan.

736
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:32,250
That too for a girl's education.

737
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:34,250
Have you lost your senses.

738
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:38,417
You want me to open the locker and show
the loads of cash to him.

739
00:56:38,417 --> 00:56:39,667
What's wrong in that?

740
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,500
He is your husband.

741
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:43,958
Don't you trust him still?

742
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,958
He's a good guy.

743
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,375
To be nice is the problem.

744
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:53,833
We are used to witness so much of
money at one place.

745
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:55,667
But for Arvind it's unusual.

746
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:59,083
Money can change anyone's mind.

747
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,125
It will take them to any extent.

748
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,667
I am very fond of Arvind.

749
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:06,833
I don't want to lose him.

750
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:11,167
I can understand

751
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,375
But he seems to be hurt so much.

752
00:57:18,917 --> 00:57:19,833
Arvind.

753
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,833
(Car engine starts)
Arvind

754
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,375
I am a criminal by myself.

755
00:57:39,792 --> 00:57:41,417
Are you trying to play smart with me?

756
00:57:44,292 --> 00:57:45,833
What did you say?

757
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,042
"I don't have that much money"

758
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:48,958
Are you trying to cheat me..

759
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:51,042
(Filthy language)

760
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:55,167
To get beaten will cause pain
If to get you killed will cause gain.

761
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:57,042
Then I shall kill you.

762
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:58,917
I will kill the entire family.

763
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:07,250
(Mobile rings)

764
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:09,375
Hey... you..

765
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,042
Hey...

766
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:20,792
Are you avoiding me and not answering my phone.

767
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:21,833
Arrogant fellow!

768
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:22,792
Subhadra..

769
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,083
Please understand me.

770
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:24,833
Shut up.

771
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:26,167
I know what you're up to.

772
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:30,292
When a normal guy marries a rich woman ...
he will fly in the air

773
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:33,833
When a cut throat criminal like you
gets married to a millionaire...

774
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,500
What else will happen..?

775
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:37,583
Am sure you got other plans.

776
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:39,250
I don't know your plan.

777
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:40,792
But one thing.

778
00:58:40,792 --> 00:58:43,125
If you ever think of cheating me...

779
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,167
Stop it Subhadra!

780
00:58:44,917 --> 00:58:46,250
I am very upset now..

781
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:47,500
Give me two days time..

782
00:58:48,042 --> 00:58:49,042
I will come and meet you in Goa.

783
00:58:49,042 --> 00:58:50,500
Who are you to fix me a time?

784
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:53,042
I want you to meet me in two hours.

785
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:54,583
Now I am at Ooty only..

786
00:58:55,042 --> 00:58:56,125
Palace guest house.

787
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:59,500
If you don't turn up ...
Police will come in search of you

788
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:00,833
Subh...

789
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,917
Bloody blackmailing b**** !

790
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:40,500
(Gun shots firing)

791
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,083
I just wanted to shoot you and get away from here..

792
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:52,375
No one can find out who the killer is..

793
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:53,583
You know why?

794
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,917
Because my name, address, appearance is all fake...

795
00:59:56,042 --> 00:59:58,292
Hey... I will finish you off..

796
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,125
Do as you wish..

797
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:01,458
Come on shoot me.

798
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,125
What are you waiting for?

799
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:05,458
Shoot me.. Shoot me..

800
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:08,958
You can't do it!

801
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:13,292
You need me..

802
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:16,042
Only I can flick the money.

803
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,042
You know that very well.

804
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,917
You are thinking your sister has got around
10 to 15 crores of money..

805
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:24,792
Yeah!

806
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:25,708
Fool..

807
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:29,167
She doesn't have just money...
she has got a big treasure.

808
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:35,458
It's in a safe room at her basement
where no one suspects.

809
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:37,375
Take a look..

810
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:48,250
It should amount to minimum 500 crores!

811
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:53,917
For every weekend Lakshmi, Nithya and the kid
go to the guest house

812
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:59,125
We will murder all of them
at the same time on their way.

813
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,958
That too... when am not in station.

814
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:06,375
Then... On hearing the news
I will rush here and cry.

815
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:09,292
The whole estate will weep on seeing me crying...

816
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,250
You come here one day later and
showcase your acting..

817
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:15,583
Then when once everything is over..

818
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:17,042
You say you want to leave...

819
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:20,708
But I will force you to stay back here..

820
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:25,125
I will get you in good books and make you the
Managing Director..

821
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:27,375
Lets behave nicely for some time..

822
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:30,958
Lets enjoy the fortune little by little.

823
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:35,167
Then we shall sell the estate to someone
and fly elsewhere.

824
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:38,042
Brilliant... Superb idea!

825
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:39,375
(Kisses)

826
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:55,042
Arvind...

827
01:01:55,792 --> 01:01:58,667
You told that once we finish everything
we will go abroad.

828
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:02,125
Shall we get married there?

829
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,833
We will not make a good match.. Subhadra.

830
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:13,292
We know about each other well..

831
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:15,250
That might land into some problem.

832
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:16,917
Then we shall both might get caught.

833
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:22,167
I appreciate your honesty!

834
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:27,667
Why are you looking sad baby?
(Giggles)

835
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:29,667
Are you thinking about Lakshmi.

836
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,708
If that accident had not happened.

837
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,208
I would have not into your trap.

838
01:02:37,042 --> 01:02:39,458
(laughing..)

839
01:02:40,792 --> 01:02:41,542
What?

840
01:02:42,042 --> 01:02:43,500
Not got into my trap?

841
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:47,417
I am the one you made that
accident happen darling!

842
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,708
Do you think you would have joined me
if I just call you in.

843
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:01,917
Hence.. I planned it.

844
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:03,917
How is it?

845
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:05,292
For the first time...

846
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:07,792
I am getting scared about you.

847
01:03:08,667 --> 01:03:09,667
Why?

848
01:03:11,292 --> 01:03:12,958
After you acquire the entire money...

849
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:15,833
I won't mind even if you refuse my share...

850
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:18,667
What if you handover me to police?

851
01:03:20,417 --> 01:03:22,458
I am not a Professional blackmailer..

852
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:26,250
I am just using you to get back
my own money.

853
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:27,375
That's all.

854
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:30,250
You will get your share.. definitely!

855
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:31,500
Believe me

856
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:35,500
Also will you handover the
video chip from your locker?

857
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:38,917
(laughing....)

858
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:41,000
Hey stupid.

859
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:44,375
It's not in a bank locker..

860
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:48,167
Its stitched safely in my body locker.

861
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:50,167
Inside your body?

862
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:51,667
How's that possible?

863
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:55,125
I have studied in medical college
for three years.

864
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:57,417
Am I not capable of doing this one?

865
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:20,792
What joy does this give you..

866
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:24,000
I have got something special.

867
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:27,792
If you use this you will fly high.

868
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:29,375
You want to try it?

869
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:31,125
Yes.

870
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:23,667
Baby... Baby... Baby...

871
01:05:23,667 --> 01:05:27,500
What I gave you is not for pleasure...
It's different.

872
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:34,042
You can see, listen but can't move a limb

873
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:38,125
Its always difficult for a divorcee or a widower..

874
01:05:38,417 --> 01:05:40,667
..to get a smart groom.

875
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:46,458
I hunt for such rich families and sneak in quietly.

876
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:47,917
And settle there happily.

877
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:50,792
When they find out the truth about me.

878
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:54,417
I kill them and move away to
my next target.

879
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:55,833
This is my style..

880
01:05:56,292 --> 01:05:57,917
But only in my Goa plan,

881
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,750
I slipped a little and fell in your trap.

882
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,208
But I should thank you for that.

883
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:06,750
You not only showed me your rich sister.

884
01:06:07,417 --> 01:06:09,000
But gave me a big treasure!

885
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:14,208
Why should I leave this fortune
and roam around.

886
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:16,000
Hereafter..

887
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:19,042
I will settle here peacefully for a lifetime.

888
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:22,833
I decided to enjoy whatever and whenever.

889
01:06:23,917 --> 01:06:29,583
But you and the video evidence was my only hurdle

890
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:58,917
I was obeying you only for
this memory card.

891
01:06:59,042 --> 01:07:02,125
If I had known earlier that
it lies inside your body.

892
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:05,958
I would have killed you the same day and left.

893
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:08,833
What did you say?

894
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:12,208
There are no evidence that you visited this place..is it?

895
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:13,792
Hey baby...

896
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:18,042
I shall leave no traces that you
lived in this world.

897
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:20,167
Subhadra...

898
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,833
See you in hell!

899
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:41,833
(Whistling sound)

900
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:55,083
Good morning Sir..

901
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:57,375
Welcome Sir..

902
01:07:57,417 --> 01:07:58,167
What's this?

903
01:07:58,750 --> 01:07:59,625
Congrats Sir!

904
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:02,417
Congrats Sir!

905
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:03,250
Congrats Sir!

906
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,000
Thank you.

907
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:09,167
You are Welcome.

908
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:10,375
Thanks.

909
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:11,708
What's all this?

910
01:08:12,542 --> 01:08:13,500
Come in.. I will tell you.

911
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:20,750
What is this?

912
01:08:21,542 --> 01:08:22,167
Go through it..

913
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:27,792
From today onwards, you will not be the Manager of this factory...

914
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:29,250
But the Managing Director!

915
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:34,625
You are henceforth a legal heir to
Lakshmi estates and its properties.

916
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:39,292
Why is this suddenly?

917
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,292
It's not a sudden decision.

918
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,292
A decision made after a deep thought.

919
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:45,375
You rightly deserve this.

920
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:47,167
I was a bit slow to understand.

921
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:53,750
(crowd applauding)

922
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:04,042
Congrats!

923
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:06,542
Hello..

924
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:07,750
Come soon..

925
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:12,542
This seat has a tradition.

926
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:15,708
It not only requires qualification and talent...

927
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:18,167
...but also a good heart.

928
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:21,167
You have it in loads..

929
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:29,375
(Mobile rings..)

930
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,708
I will be back..
Yeah.

931
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:33,292
Hello..

932
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:15,500
I have been the Legal Advisor to this company
since your father's time..

933
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:19,208
You have not taken any major decision
without consulting us.

934
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:22,708
But in this instance
you have been haste!

935
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,792
We have known him for only six months..

936
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:27,125
Without getting his full details....

937
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:29,208
What are you talking?
He's my husband.

938
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:30,417
What else you need?

939
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:31,250
Madam..

940
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:34,917
Marriage is your personal matter.
We don't wish to interfere in it.

941
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:37,708
But this concerns the lives of
thousands of workers.

942
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:40,458
Without consulting us you have
made him the Managing Director!

943
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:42,292
Okay.. it's just a post.

944
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:48,083
But to make him a legal heir for all
the properties doesn't seem right.

945
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:49,292
No uncle..

946
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:53,042
An incident which took place today
morning disturbed me a lot.

947
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:55,458
That's why I had to take such a decision.

948
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:58,417
For that you can't make him a legal heir.

949
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:00,500
It involves lot of formalities.

950
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:04,375
Should have organized a Board meeting and
..asked for others opinion and then finalized.

951
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,167
Yes.

952
01:11:06,042 --> 01:11:07,042
Don't you know this?

953
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:08,542
You are a brilliant lady.

954
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:11,417
It's ok.. Don't make it official.

955
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:15,250
But immediately I can't tell him that he is not the MD.

956
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:16,833
He might get upset.

957
01:11:17,292 --> 01:11:18,417
What can we do?

958
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:19,625
Do as I say.

959
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:21,417
Don't initiate the legal transfer now.

960
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,042
Let him remain as MD as per your wish.

961
01:11:24,542 --> 01:11:28,667
At least now let's check his details and whereabouts..
And if everything is fine.

962
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,250
We will then complete the registration.

963
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,083
Till then..

964
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:34,708
He will be a rubber stamp without any potential powers
That's it.

965
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:31,208
(Breaking news)
Terror in Goa.

966
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:35,708
Three foreign travellers have been
brutally murdered in Panaji.

967
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:39,917
In recent times these kind of incidents
have been increasing in Goa.

968
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:40,833
Please sign this cheque Sir.

969
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:44,417
During a press meet, S P Mangat Goyal told...

970
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,250
"Couples and tourists who go to lonely places are the targets of these culprits"

971
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:50,208
Sir.. Please sign the cheque ..
Madam wants it urgently.

972
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:52,000
Sir...

973
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:55,417
"We are giving enough protection..
..public needs to co-operate"

974
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:57,958
"We will catch the criminals soon"

975
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:01,542
Reporter : Recently, someone killed Jessy Family and blasted.

976
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:06,875
You told that it's a brutal murder, high profile case
and assured to catch the criminals.

977
01:13:07,042 --> 01:13:08,917
It's six months now..
What actions have you taken?

978
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:12,333
"There's no link between tourist spot murder
and Jessy family murder"

979
01:13:12,542 --> 01:13:14,875
"Drugs and sex are the reason behind
tourist spot murder case.."

980
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,083
"But Jessy case is a preplanned brutal murder!"

981
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:18,875
"Done by her husband"

982
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,958
"To avoid suspicion ..."

983
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:25,917
"He had killed a newspaper boy
and left his body inside the house"

984
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:29,417
"We were perplexed with no other evidences.."

985
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:32,000
"So, the murderer thought he had escaped"

986
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:34,750
"But now we have substantial evidence"

987
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,750
"The cab in which he escaped met with an accident"

988
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:39,083
"The cab driver suffered a head injury ..

989
01:13:39,292 --> 01:13:41,042
and was in coma all these time"

990
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,125
"Now he has given a clue that the guy who travelled in his car"

991
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:47,167
"And the killer who left Jessy house are the same person"

992
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:51,292
"Moreover, the guy who killed an entire family
in Kolkata must be him"

993
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:54,083
Reporter : How can you decide that it's the same guy?

994
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:57,833
"Modus Operandi..
The target of both the guys are rich single mother"

995
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:01,000
"Once he kills them.. the entire house is blasted
to destroy evidences"

996
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,833
"In order to hide his face and identity ..

997
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:06,917
..he had used an umbrella on a sunny day"

998
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:12,375
"If I am right this cannot be his
first or second murder.

999
01:14:15,042 --> 01:14:16,458
"He must be a serial killer!!"

1000
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:22,625
"These kind of serial killers will not remain idle
...for more than four months..."

1001
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:26,333
"By now he should have fixed his next target"

1002
01:14:30,042 --> 01:14:31,750
"We have shared his sketch to all the states.."

1003
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:34,750
"He will get caught this time somewhere"

1004
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,583
"His days are numbered!!"

1005
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:49,458
F***
You can't touch my shadow also!

1006
01:15:16,417 --> 01:15:17,250
Mr.Arvind..

1007
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:20,042
Yes.

1008
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:22,125
You are under arrest!

1009
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:22,583
What...?

1010
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:30,583
(laughing)

1011
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:32,750
Hey... relax buddy..

1012
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:35,167
(Laughing)
You got scared right.

1013
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:37,417
(laughing)

1014
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:39,333
I am Vijay.

1015
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:42,333
Asst Commissioner of Police, Ooty.

1016
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,417
Lakshmi's close friend.

1017
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:44,208
Nice to meet you.

1018
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,250
You know... Myself, Lakshmi and Ashok.

1019
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:50,083
All eggs from one basket.

1020
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:52,000
Fantastic group.

1021
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:54,042
We are friends from childhood till now..

1022
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:55,125
Twenty six years..

1023
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:55,583
Wow!

1024
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,042
Then a small gap..

1025
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:00,917
I had to leave Ooty for deputation.

1026
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:02,292
Now I am back.

1027
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:03,375
Nice to have you back.

1028
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:04,417
Thank you..

1029
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:08,875
You know.. Lakshmi was highly depressed
after Ashok's demise.

1030
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:11,417
I am witnessing smile in her face only now..

1031
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:13,792
I know you are the reason for it.

1032
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:14,875
You are from?

1033
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,375
Chenn.. Mumbai.

1034
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:17,583
Where did you study?

1035
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:18,500
At Stanford.

1036
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:20,875
But Lakshmi told me you are from Harvard.

1037
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:22,667
That's my UG... this is my PG.

1038
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:23,875
Where did you work?

1039
01:16:24,125 --> 01:16:25,125
At Bardia.. Indore.

1040
01:16:25,792 --> 01:16:26,250
Indore..

1041
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:27,333
It's shut down right .

1042
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:28,167
Yeah.. before two years.

1043
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,917
What were you doing for two years?

1044
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:33,167
Was selling paan under the Himalayas.

1045
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:34,792
What brother...?

1046
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:36,417
Your friend is interviewing me..

1047
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,792
Now you are interrogating me.

1048
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:39,083
Your entire team is like this only ...

1049
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:40,667
(Both laughing)

1050
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,667
Okay.. Let's catch up for a drink sometime.

1051
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:44,917
I don't consume liquor.

1052
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,458
Hey.. man.

1053
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,375
No smoking... no drinking...

1054
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,667
Are you a teetotaller?

1055
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:50,750
I tell lies at times.

1056
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:53,083
Nice one.

1057
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:54,583
Okay.

1058
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:56,417
Will catch you later.

1059
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:10,750
John..

1060
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,500
Hey John...
How many times have I told you..

1061
01:17:13,542 --> 01:17:14,917
..not to keep coffee cups near the files..

1062
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,583
Idiot, you guys have to be reported to Madam
and chucked out.

1063
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:33,167
Hey John..

1064
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:39,292
John sounds like a good name.

1065
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,458
Then why have you changed your name to Arvind?

1066
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:43,250
Is it for numerology ?

1067
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,500
Or astrology?

1068
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:47,833
Hey..

1069
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:49,250
What are you blabbering?

1070
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,333
I am not blabbering MD John.

1071
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:52,625
But talking facts.

1072
01:17:53,042 --> 01:17:55,542
You look shocked when I address you as "John".

1073
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:58,083
After watching the murder news in Goa.. you got frightened..

1074
01:17:58,292 --> 01:18:03,292
You signed the Tata Impex cheque
as John instead of Arvind.

1075
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:04,583
Fraudster!

1076
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:05,500
Hey..

1077
01:18:06,792 --> 01:18:07,958
(Filthy language)
Who is a fraudster?

1078
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:09,375
It's you..

1079
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:11,542
You got frightened on the sight of Police.

1080
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:12,708
Who are you?

1081
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,667
You need to get scared only when
you commit a crime.

1082
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:18,667
You look as though you have
done a big crime.

1083
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:20,250
Are you drunk?

1084
01:18:20,667 --> 01:18:21,583
You are talking too much.

1085
01:18:22,917 --> 01:18:23,917
You are talking to the MD.

1086
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:24,875
I will fire you.

1087
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:27,417
Oh my God.!
..Don't fire me Sir.

1088
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:28,750
Am getting scared... Arvind Sir..

1089
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,833
Sorry... John Sir.

1090
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:31,167
Hey..

1091
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,333
"John" is my nickname.

1092
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,333
Oh..

1093
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:36,750
You can change your religion
for a nickname.. is it?

1094
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:40,083
One day I saw you in a church.
But I didn't take it seriously.

1095
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:44,750
But when I checked the details you gave about
yourself in internet.

1096
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:47,625
I couldn't find Arvind anywhere in those details.

1097
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:50,042
None of the details you gave me matched there.

1098
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:53,833
When you proposed the job for a lady
I was overwhelmed.

1099
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:57,292
But you grabbed the Manager position
without applying for that job.

1100
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,875
Then I learnt you are a tactic person!

1101
01:18:59,417 --> 01:19:01,042
Then you played your drama and fooled Madam..

1102
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:02,375
That's your master plan.

1103
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:05,917
But when you removed her from her seat
and took over it.

1104
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:07,000
That was your milestone!

1105
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:12,375
A person who shows off as a good person
is more dangerous than a bad guy.

1106
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:15,000
I know you are dangerous..

1107
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:17,875
But it's not clear if you are a fraudster or criminal.

1108
01:19:18,417 --> 01:19:22,208
To find more about you, this one
evidence is more than enough.

1109
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:36,125
Do you want to stab me to death?

1110
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:38,500
You can do nothing!

1111
01:19:39,667 --> 01:19:42,292
Mr.Arvind alias Mr.John alias Mr X.

1112
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:43,750
Alright.

1113
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:45,000
What's your price?

1114
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:46,833
Too smart..

1115
01:19:47,417 --> 01:19:48,917
Will meet at my home today evening.

1116
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:01,125
Nithya.. Mitoo.. come come.
It's getting late.

1117
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,167
(Mobile rings)

1118
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,917
Tell me Prakash..

1119
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:09,583
Madam.. you told me that you will
send the cheque yesterday itself..

1120
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:10,667
Haven't received it yet.

1121
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:12,042
Is that so?

1122
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:14,167
Let me check.

1123
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,167
Ramanathan.. haven't you sent the
cheque to Tata Impex yet ?

1124
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:19,458
I gave it to Daisy yesterday itself Madam.

1125
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:21,958
Oh.. Won't you check if it has got cleared or not?

1126
01:20:22,292 --> 01:20:22,875
Call Daisy.

1127
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:24,792
She's not in office today.
Her mobile is switched off.

1128
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,250
(Mobile rings)

1129
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:29,500
Hello..

1130
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:31,375
Did Daisy give any cheque to you?

1131
01:20:31,667 --> 01:20:32,917
I signed it and gave it to her yesterday.

1132
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,500
She hasn't come to office today.

1133
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:36,000
Did she tell you anything?

1134
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:38,083
She is your secretary.

1135
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,333
Like how you spend your weekend.

1136
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,083
She would have gone to any week end trip like you.

1137
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:43,125
Okay.

1138
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:43,958
I will take care.

1139
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:46,625
We all are leaving to the guest house.

1140
01:20:47,083 --> 01:20:47,625
You join us there.

1141
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:49,042
Okay... Bye.

1142
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:55,500
Oh God...

1143
01:20:58,583 --> 01:20:59,083
Daisy..

1144
01:21:00,917 --> 01:21:01,458
Daisy...

1145
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:03,708
Madam wants you in office.

1146
01:21:09,792 --> 01:21:10,375
Daisy..

1147
01:21:37,042 --> 01:21:37,583
Get away...

1148
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:40,125
Hey go away..

1149
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:22,375
Who is going to eat this?

1150
01:22:27,833 --> 01:22:28,583
Madam.. phone for you.

1151
01:22:31,792 --> 01:22:32,083
Hello..

1152
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:33,125
Yeah Vijay.

1153
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:34,208
Lakshmi... Got a bad news!

1154
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:35,875
Daisy was brutally murdered!

1155
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,625
What?

1156
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:38,167
Very horrific!!

1157
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:41,667
She was killed and buried in
her own garden.

1158
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:43,667
The things at her home are a mess.

1159
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:47,417
So.. they have come to look for something.

1160
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:49,208
It should be something personal.

1161
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:51,625
Definitely it should be someone familiar to her.

1162
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:02,167
Five percent.

1163
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:02,792
Nope.

1164
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:04,083
Seven percent.

1165
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,042
Not enough!

1166
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:06,292
Ten percent.. That's it!

1167
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:08,042
Brokers get paid that way.

1168
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,542
I am not a broker.

1169
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:12,375
Okay.. I will give you a bonanza offer!

1170
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:14,667
Let me be a part of your game..

1171
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:16,625
Both in life and business.

1172
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:17,792
50/50

1173
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:21,083
If you accept.. then it's a deal..
Else go to Prison.

1174
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:22,875
Hey.. it's not possible.

1175
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:24,500
Okay.. I will inform Madam.

1176
01:23:33,292 --> 01:23:34,458
Hey...leave me..

1177
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:47,417
Where is the cheque?

1178
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:49,583
(Panting for breath)

1179
01:23:58,667 --> 01:23:59,708
Where is the cheque?

1180
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:01,083
I can't tell you.

1181
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:02,750
Where is the cheque?

1182
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:07,667
Where is the cheque?

1183
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:08,750
I can't give it to you.

1184
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:20,375
Come on..

1185
01:24:20,458 --> 01:24:21,167
Oh..

1186
01:24:21,917 --> 01:24:22,917
Hey come on..

1187
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:25,125
Come on..

1188
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,458
You won't give me right.

1189
01:24:31,917 --> 01:24:32,958
I will take it myself..

1190
01:25:22,292 --> 01:25:24,958
Hey... Lakshmi.

1191
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:25,667
Are you ok?

1192
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:27,000
I told you.

1193
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:28,875
You will not be able to bear this.

1194
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,500
You don't listen to me.
Are you okay?

1195
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:31,542
Hey please.

1196
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:33,083
Vijay...
Take her away.

1197
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:34,375
(weeping)

1198
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:35,792
Daisy is innocent...

1199
01:25:44,292 --> 01:25:45,417
Any evidence?

1200
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:46,750
Nope!

1201
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:48,083
What would be the motive?

1202
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:49,917
What else can you think of?

1203
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:51,583
Daisy is a 28 yrs old dame.

1204
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:53,625
She looks beautiful, single and unmarried.

1205
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:55,958
What do you think?

1206
01:25:56,042 --> 01:25:57,042
My assumption is..

1207
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:58,792
Love, lust, jealousy!

1208
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:00,500
It could be anyone of this.

1209
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:03,958
Someone could have proposed Daisy for sex or love.

1210
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:05,625
She would have refused.

1211
01:26:05,792 --> 01:26:07,500
And could have possibly insulted him.

1212
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:11,583
Out of anguish, he would have killed her
and buried her here.

1213
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:12,625
Excellent!

1214
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:14,542
I reckon your predictions must be true.

1215
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:16,333
I don't think so.

1216
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:18,750
There could be other reasons too.

1217
01:26:19,042 --> 01:26:25,250
Daisy might have got involved
in a crime with the killer.

1218
01:26:25,417 --> 01:26:29,000
They could have ended up into a disagreement.

1219
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,083
When Daisy tried to escape.. she must have got killed.

1220
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:33,792
Whom do you suspect?

1221
01:26:34,542 --> 01:26:35,958
Who could it be?

1222
01:26:35,958 --> 01:26:39,958
Will a terrorist come from Pakistan to kill her?

1223
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:41,750
(laughing...)

1224
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:46,583
The killer must be here within 6 kms.

1225
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:51,500
I will catch him in another 48 hrs.

1226
01:26:52,042 --> 01:26:54,042
48 hrs!

1227
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,083
When you catch him..
let me know Vijay.

1228
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:58,375
I must see him.

1229
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:01,292
Daisy was not just a staff.

1230
01:27:01,667 --> 01:27:03,208
She was a part of our family.

1231
01:27:03,625 --> 01:27:04,333
Please.

1232
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:05,500
Do the needful.

1233
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:07,125
Yeah.

1234
01:27:17,417 --> 01:27:18,125
Sir...

1235
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:18,792
What?

1236
01:27:18,792 --> 01:27:21,125
We found this cheque inside the girl's brassiere.

1237
01:27:24,208 --> 01:27:26,375
Signature is not clear.

1238
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:28,333
The cheque belongs to Lakshmi estate.

1239
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:32,250
Why had she kept this cheque inside her brassiere.

1240
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,250
This will lead to the killer.

1241
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:36,542
Send it to forensic.

1242
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:37,167
Okay Sir.

1243
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:44,542
This is the original condition of the cheque.

1244
01:27:44,667 --> 01:27:45,583
We treated it.

1245
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,625
We have retrieved the signature.

1246
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,292
The signature reads as John.

1247
01:27:50,417 --> 01:27:51,458
John..?

1248
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:56,958
Who is John?

1249
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:01,542
Is anyone named John here?

1250
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:03,125
Yes Sir.. the house keeping boy.

1251
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:04,625
Sir.. I am John.

1252
01:28:05,042 --> 01:28:06,875
Daisy is very greedy in nature.

1253
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:08,292
She's a good girl Sir.

1254
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:09,167
A talkative Girl.

1255
01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:12,333
Her aim was to go abroad and
lead a rich life.

1256
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:14,167
She has been working here
for a long time.

1257
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:16,333
She handles everything for madam.

1258
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:18,208
She will obey to whatever madam says.

1259
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:20,333
When madam is not there,
she used to sit on her chair.

1260
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:21,958
She used to admire Arvind Sir.

1261
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:22,625
Hey..

1262
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:23,875
Skip that!

1263
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,333
Who has the authority to sign the cheques?

1264
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:28,333
I have power to sign cheques upto One Lakh.

1265
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:31,000
If it's a higher amount.. earlier it was Lakshmi Madam.

1266
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,792
But now it's MD Arvind Sir.

1267
01:28:34,667 --> 01:28:37,292
Have any cheques been issued to
Tata Impex in last one week.

1268
01:28:37,292 --> 01:28:37,875
Yes Sir.

1269
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:39,208
Seventy Lakhs is the amount.

1270
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:40,500
I gave the cheque to Daisy.

1271
01:28:40,542 --> 01:28:43,333
Asked her to get it signed from Arvind Sir
and to despatch it.

1272
01:28:43,417 --> 01:28:44,917
But I am not sure what happened?

1273
01:28:44,958 --> 01:28:46,542
That cheque is missing.

1274
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:51,125
Madam got tensed because the cheque hadn't cleared.

1275
01:28:51,917 --> 01:28:54,750
Is there reference of your MD's signature?

1276
01:28:54,792 --> 01:28:56,750
Why Sir? Any problem?

1277
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:58,083
Just for a small verification.

1278
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:59,750
I will talk to Lakshmi.

1279
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:00,958
I will give you Sir.

1280
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:07,208
Sir.. here it is.

1281
01:29:10,417 --> 01:29:11,208
Sir..

1282
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:16,667
Give me that cheque.

1283
01:29:21,792 --> 01:29:23,292
Same style.

1284
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:24,500
Same stroke.

1285
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:26,958
Both the signatures looks identical.

1286
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:28,750
It's the same guy.

1287
01:29:48,042 --> 01:29:50,333
(Mobile ringing)

1288
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:57,292
(Busy tone in mobile)

1289
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:02,333
Nithya... come on pick up.. pick up!

1290
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:03,417
Attend my call.

1291
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,333
Shit.

1292
01:30:27,208 --> 01:30:28,292
Tell me Vijay.

1293
01:30:28,292 --> 01:30:29,500
Where are you guys?

1294
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:30,875
Couldn't find you at home nor in office?

1295
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:32,417
Why are you guys not picking the phone?

1296
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:34,667
Why are getting so tensed?

1297
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:37,625
We have come to Masanagudi guest house
for the weekend.

1298
01:30:37,792 --> 01:30:39,083
Okay.. Where's Arvind?

1299
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,958
Why?

1300
01:30:42,542 --> 01:30:43,958
He's here with us only.

1301
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:44,958
Why? What happened?

1302
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:46,125
Please move away from him.

1303
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:48,333
And speak to me.

1304
01:30:48,667 --> 01:30:51,083
He should not listen to our conversation.

1305
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:02,000
What happened man?

1306
01:31:02,667 --> 01:31:04,208
When we checked Daisy's body.

1307
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:07,208
We found a cheque for seventy lakhs
hidden in her brassiere.

1308
01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:08,750
It was signed as "John".

1309
01:31:09,208 --> 01:31:10,958
John?
Yes.

1310
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,167
Why did he sign?

1311
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:13,875
No.. it was not him!

1312
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:16,292
Arvind has signed as "John".

1313
01:31:17,042 --> 01:31:18,875
Why should Arvind sign as "John"?

1314
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:20,333
Even I am not clear about it.

1315
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:24,917
But I am sure that Arvind has some
connection in Daisy's murder.

1316
01:31:26,792 --> 01:31:28,000
What are you saying?

1317
01:31:28,042 --> 01:31:29,208
I am just guessing.

1318
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:30,333
No... I don't think so.

1319
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:31,667
Let me ask Arvind.

1320
01:31:31,708 --> 01:31:33,958
No.. I am just coming there.

1321
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:36,000
Please stay casual as if you
don't know anything.

1322
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,542
Most importantly,

1323
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:38,500
Make sure Arvind doesn't go out.

1324
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:41,000
Lakshmi.. I have my doubts on Arvind.

1325
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:42,500
Let me come and get it cleared.

1326
01:31:42,583 --> 01:31:44,292
I will be there in another hour.

1327
01:31:44,292 --> 01:31:44,958
okay.

1328
01:31:49,667 --> 01:31:50,958
You play guitar well.

1329
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:51,792
Where did you learn?

1330
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:52,792
At Church.

1331
01:31:53,083 --> 01:31:53,875
Church?

1332
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:55,500
My friend used to play at Church.

1333
01:31:55,875 --> 01:31:57,125
He taught me.

1334
01:31:57,125 --> 01:31:58,750
I saw Arvind Sir at the Church.

1335
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:00,417
Is he a christian ?

1336
01:32:00,542 --> 01:32:01,083
Why?

1337
01:32:01,333 --> 01:32:03,458
Only Christian's have to go to church.. is it?

1338
01:32:03,625 --> 01:32:05,125
Carry on with your work.

1339
01:32:05,167 --> 01:32:06,292
Take it..
No.

1340
01:32:38,667 --> 01:32:39,750
Hey..

1341
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:49,083
Nithya..

1342
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:50,792
Yeah... Coming.

1343
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:54,125
What are doing with your phone
when I am here.

1344
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:55,333
What sister?

1345
01:32:55,625 --> 01:32:57,167
Take the baby to her room.
Alright.

1346
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,417
Why? Let her stay here.

1347
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:02,208
Don't we need privacy?

1348
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,125
Looks like you are in a romantic mood.

1349
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:05,958
Why?

1350
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:07,542
Should'nt I?

1351
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:08,750
Mmm..

1352
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:11,000
I am having a slight headache.

1353
01:33:11,292 --> 01:33:12,625
Should be fine if I take a tablet.

1354
01:33:12,917 --> 01:33:14,000
Do you have any?

1355
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:14,833
It's in the bedroom.

1356
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:15,500
Let me bring it.

1357
01:33:15,542 --> 01:33:17,500
No.. No..
I will take it myself.

1358
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:18,708
Before that.

1359
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:20,458
Can I have a cup of coffee from you.

1360
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:22,542
Then we will romance.

1361
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Sure.

1362
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:25,625
I will be back in five minutes.

1363
01:34:20,958 --> 01:34:22,292
Arvind... Your coffee.

1364
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:42,208
Arvind.

1365
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:44,417
Arvind.. What are you doing?

1366
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:46,333
Relax..

1367
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:52,625
Hey.. Hey..

1368
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:54,625
Leave me.. Arvind.

1369
01:35:00,292 --> 01:35:01,083
No..

1370
01:35:01,125 --> 01:35:01,792
No worries..

1371
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:03,500
Will get over soon.

1372
01:35:04,542 --> 01:35:06,000
Relax.

1373
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:07,833
Relax.

1374
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:11,333
Easy...

1375
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:26,625
Don't get scared.

1376
01:35:27,292 --> 01:35:28,292
This is not a poisonous injection.

1377
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:30,750
It's partial numbness.

1378
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:35,333
Your body will be numb except for your eye movements.

1379
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,375
It's just for an hour.

1380
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:42,792
I haven't spent more than a year with one family.

1381
01:35:43,417 --> 01:35:45,750
If they have a slightest doubt on me.

1382
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:51,792
I kill them and move on to my next
target like a nomad.

1383
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:54,417
What I need is money.. money.. money!

1384
01:35:54,417 --> 01:35:56,083
Ultimately money!!

1385
01:35:57,667 --> 01:35:58,958
Do you know one thing.

1386
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:02,875
Your matrimony advertisement didn't
bring me here.

1387
01:36:03,792 --> 01:36:07,000
I was sent here by your sister..
Subhadra.

1388
01:36:08,417 --> 01:36:12,958
She was the one who planned
to loot money from you.

1389
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:15,333
Bloody blackmailer!

1390
01:36:15,542 --> 01:36:20,125
I came here with a compulsion to do whatever she says.

1391
01:36:20,292 --> 01:36:23,500
But after witnessing your money.

1392
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:26,333
I decided to settle here.

1393
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:34,792
I didn't think that a small signature
will change my destiny.

1394
01:36:35,708 --> 01:36:36,417
Daisy.

1395
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,208
(strong language)

1396
01:36:38,333 --> 01:36:39,417
She found the truth about me.

1397
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:40,500
So I killed her.

1398
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:44,750
I buried her underneath the ground.

1399
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:48,667
I was happy for sometime with clean hands.

1400
01:36:48,833 --> 01:36:51,792
I wanted to enjoy the wealth like a King.

1401
01:36:52,458 --> 01:36:55,625
But it will not happen if
Subhadra was alive.

1402
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:57,292
When I was thinking about it.

1403
01:36:57,292 --> 01:37:00,917
The hunt for the tiger was the issue at the estate.

1404
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:03,208
Subhadra was my prey inside the
cage to catch the tiger.

1405
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,000
Hey Baby...

1406
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,875
I am coming.

1407
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:08,875
No.

1408
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:12,333
I will be back.

1409
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:17,375
Baby... Wake up.

1410
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:19,583
(Glass breaking sound)

1411
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,875
Hey.

1412
01:37:36,292 --> 01:37:37,542
Arvind.. Pls don't!

1413
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:40,083
Why are you getting scared..?

1414
01:37:40,625 --> 01:37:43,000
I am here because of you.

1415
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:45,958
You are the one who truly believed me.

1416
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,792
Please... Please.

1417
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:48,083
What do we do now?

1418
01:37:48,083 --> 01:37:50,000
Only If I kill you without any evidence.

1419
01:37:50,333 --> 01:37:51,625
I can survive.

1420
01:37:51,792 --> 01:37:53,792
No.

1421
01:37:53,792 --> 01:37:56,000
No.. Arvind.

1422
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,333
It's paining.

1423
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:02,500
No.. No.

1424
01:38:02,875 --> 01:38:03,875
Nithya.

1425
01:38:04,292 --> 01:38:05,292
It's okay.

1426
01:42:07,792 --> 01:42:09,000
Nithya.

1427
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:10,875
Nithya.

1428
01:43:20,875 --> 01:43:23,083
Wake up.. Nithya.

1429
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,500
Wake up.. Nithya.

1430
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:03,792
Sister.

1431
01:44:06,333 --> 01:44:07,750
Nithya.

1432
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:13,500
Arvind has left a tiger inside the house to kill us.

1433
01:44:13,875 --> 01:44:14,958
Mummy.

1434
01:44:18,083 --> 01:44:21,542
Now it's in the kitchen.

1435
01:44:23,542 --> 01:44:24,375
Mummy.. Mummy..

1436
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:25,792
Look there's a tiger!

1437
01:44:42,583 --> 01:44:44,125
Sister.. I am afraid.

1438
01:44:44,125 --> 01:44:45,125
What can we do now?

1439
01:44:45,125 --> 01:44:46,292
Shall we call the Police?

1440
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,625
My phone is missing!

1441
01:44:52,333 --> 01:44:53,333
My phone is also missing!

1442
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:57,292
Let me see if I can hold the tiger
inside the kitchen.

1443
01:45:36,708 --> 01:45:40,042
Arvind.. has shut all the doors.

1444
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,083
We have to escape from the tiger.

1445
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:55,542
(Tiger roars)

1446
01:46:10,375 --> 01:46:13,083
We will get caught if we all stay together.

1447
01:46:14,042 --> 01:46:15,750
I will go and open the secret door.

1448
01:46:16,042 --> 01:46:19,042
Please stay here... Don't go anywhere.
sure.

1449
01:47:55,375 --> 01:47:57,583
(Jeep honking)

1450
01:47:59,792 --> 01:48:01,625
Road is blocked by a fallen tree

1451
01:48:30,792 --> 01:48:32,667
Help.. help please.

1452
01:48:32,833 --> 01:48:34,125
Someone... please help.

1453
01:48:34,542 --> 01:48:35,292
Please.

1454
01:48:36,417 --> 01:48:38,208
Save us please.

1455
01:50:06,208 --> 01:50:07,792
You take my life.

1456
01:50:08,542 --> 01:50:10,875
But please let go Nithya and my kid.

1457
01:51:48,667 --> 01:51:49,250
Lakshmi..

1458
01:51:50,208 --> 01:51:53,333
(Door knocking)
Lakshmi

1459
01:52:04,667 --> 01:52:05,208
Nithya..

1460
01:52:07,125 --> 01:52:08,000
Nithya..

1461
01:52:14,292 --> 01:52:14,917
Arvind..

1462
01:52:25,708 --> 01:52:27,208
(Shouts in shock)

1463
01:52:50,833 --> 01:52:51,333
Lakshmi.

1464
01:52:53,125 --> 01:52:53,583
Vijay.

1465
01:52:55,125 --> 01:52:57,083
Arvind is a brutal killer.

1466
01:52:57,292 --> 01:52:58,167
I can't hear you.

1467
01:52:58,958 --> 01:53:00,208
He has locked us inside.

1468
01:53:00,792 --> 01:53:02,125
Please save us!

1469
01:53:02,292 --> 01:53:05,292
Where is Arvind... tell me..
Tell me Lakshmi.

1470
01:53:06,208 --> 01:53:07,500
Vijay.. look behind you.

1471
01:57:15,875 --> 01:57:17,167
Mummy..

1472
01:57:17,292 --> 01:57:18,667
(Baby crying)

1473
01:57:21,208 --> 01:57:23,417
Mummy..
(Baby crying)

1474
01:57:45,958 --> 01:57:47,083
Mitoo...

1475
01:57:58,250 --> 01:57:59,750
Mummy...

1476
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:20,958
Baby..

1477
01:58:22,917 --> 01:58:23,792
Sister...

1478
01:58:24,125 --> 01:58:25,958
Nithya.. take the baby and leave..

1479
02:00:17,458 --> 02:00:18,667
No

1480
02:01:07,167 --> 02:01:09,042
(Gun shots fired)

1481
02:02:51,583 --> 02:02:54,292
(Glass breaking)

1482
02:04:11,333 --> 02:04:12,792
(Shouts in pain)

1483
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:25,875
Betrayer..

1484
02:04:26,792 --> 02:04:28,708
I trusted you so much.

1485
02:04:29,167 --> 02:04:30,000
That's was your fault!

1486
02:04:30,917 --> 02:04:32,417
But this is my character!

1487
02:04:33,083 --> 02:04:33,875
It will never change!

1488
02:04:34,583 --> 02:04:35,542
I am sorry.

1489
02:04:35,708 --> 02:04:36,792
Don't spare him!

1490
02:04:36,875 --> 02:04:37,500
Kill him!

1491
02:04:37,708 --> 02:04:38,708
Leave me.

1492
02:04:39,458 --> 02:04:41,250
I will never come into your life again.

1493
02:04:41,958 --> 02:04:43,292
I will go far away.

1494
02:04:43,667 --> 02:04:44,333
Then?

1495
02:04:45,458 --> 02:04:47,292
You will ruin another family.

1496
02:04:48,042 --> 02:04:50,417
A beast hunts only when it starves.

1497
02:04:51,417 --> 02:04:53,458
But selfish people like you.

1498
02:04:54,208 --> 02:04:56,667
Will go to any extent.

1499
02:05:00,792 --> 02:05:02,542
You are not worthy to live.

1500
02:08:22,875 --> 02:08:24,625
