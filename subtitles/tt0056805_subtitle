1
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:50,041
His highness is arriving!

2
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,416
Did the elder princess have her breakfast?

3
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,625
What's the meaning of this silence?

4
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,500
I took the breakfast to her as you ordered me to, sir.

5
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,208
But the elder princess has sent her breakfast back.

6
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,916
Take the breakfast along

7
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,041
Take the breakfast.

8
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,416
Rincess,

9
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,625
please have mercy on this elderly doctor.

10
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:42,833
I promise you

11
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,416
that with this medicine

12
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:45,833
you'll be fine soon.

13
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,416
Here.

14
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,416
I've been hearing this for the past 5 years.

15
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,416
Nothing happened till today.

16
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,000
And nothing will happen hence forth.

17
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,416
Never!

18
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:01,125
A person should never loose lose hope, o princess.

19
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,000
Hope..

20
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,208
Hope is just an illusion

21
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:10,041
I don't want any illusion or deception

22
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,833
I just want to die

23
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,583
Why don't you give me some poison?

24
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,416
T's better to die then to live a life of a handicap.

25
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,541
May your enemies die

26
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,375
Princess, please, don't say such things.

27
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,041
I swear you on my old age.

28
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:26,916
Please, have it.

29
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,916
I don't want it! - Princess!

30
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,833
You all look like dummies.

31
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,416
Isn't any one of you a human being?

32
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,416
Please, say something

33
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,625
I'm suffocating.

34
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,375
Rince Pratap Singh,

35
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:46,791
can you do this?

36
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:47,708
Baby,

37
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,916
his highness would never like this.

38
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,166
What if his highness comes?

39
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,166
Hey, all dummies have come to life. That's nice.

40
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,541
How shameful!

41
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,416
You haven't learnt any manners being a princess.

42
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:21,625
I have learned your highness.

43
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,791
A princess shouldn't play.

44
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:24,958
Correct!

45
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,416
Ou are the daughter of a king?

46
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,875
If you wanted to be a jester then..

47
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,291
Ou should have been born in a jester's home.

48
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:33,916
It was a mistake highness.

49
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,375
What do you mean

50
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:36,708
I mean to say that

51
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,875
I shouldn't have behaved this way.

52
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,875
Yes

53
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:13,125
I'm sorry, your highness.

54
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,166
It's the treachery of the same Randhir.

55
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,166
He provokes innocent people against you, sir.

56
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,500
This parade is headed towards the Red valley.

57
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,750
His father is still working with us

58
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,750
yes highness

59
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:27,708
Yesterday's program to be heard

60
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,708
yes highness

61
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,916
His highness, the King Balbir Singh..

62
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,833
Shenaz Shamsher Bahadur, the wealthiest emperors..

63
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,666
K.C.I.A.O.B. of the Himatpur kingdom.

64
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,666
By the orders of his majesty..

65
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,625
It would be better if you take guards along with you, sir.

66
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,625
There's no need.

67
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,541
We do the hard work and the wealth goes to the castle.

68
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,500
We spend our sweat and blood

69
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,666
and these useless get the luxuries.

70
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,416
They are not our well-wishers

71
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:24,083
but enemies.

72
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,083
Brothers!

73
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,625
We have our hatred for those principles"

74
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,708
that ruling kingdom which Differentiates people.

75
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,583
But brothers, they can't deceive us anymore.

76
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,125
As you know

77
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:40,041
the major part of India is divided into kingdoms

78
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,416
It's our duty

79
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:42,333
to end this

80
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,083
Imperialism forever

81
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,916
So protest with me, down with imperialism!

82
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,083
All hail to democracy

83
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,416
All hail for our freedom

84
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,416
Run!

85
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,750
Good! Very good!

86
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,333
Before me my faithful servants slapped you on you face.

87
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,791
You wanted to fight against me their support.

88
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,000
You wanted to become a leader with their support

89
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,875
I'm not a leader, your highness.

90
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,416
I'm just a servant of the public.

91
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,000
Freedom is every human being's birth right.

92
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,375
And they should get that right.

93
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,625
My kingdom doesn't need any kind of freedom

94
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,833
That's why they left you.

95
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,833
Every suffering and weak human is afraid of the powerful.

96
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,416
This is the reason they ran away from you.

97
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,833
But believe me your highness, one day..

98
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,833
They'll have the strength to stand against you.

99
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,750
Before that you'll be silenced.

100
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:41,791
Remember this,

101
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,416
if you do such act again..

102
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,000
Then you'll be treated in the same manner..

103
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,000
S an enemy is treated

104
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,500
Take this away.

105
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,083
Sir

106
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,083
the princes and the princess have arrived.

107
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,416
How was the party hologram

108
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,166
Is Very good your highness

109
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,541
I was also writing

110
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,833
I read the

111
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,250
good

112
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,250
And you

113
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,416
I was at the opening ceremony of Meena Bazaar

114
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:29,375
Dance was

115
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,083
More people were

116
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,125
But all of women, your highness.

117
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,416
Strange! You still don't know that..

118
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,125
Only women are allowed at the Meena Bazaar.

119
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,291
I'm sorry, your highness

120
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,166
And you princess Ashalatadevi

121
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,750
I had gone to the holy meeting

122
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,416
But I didn't

123
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,833
read what was given to me

124
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:52,916
Why?

125
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,333
The people wanted to know about my thoughts

126
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,250
Your thoughts are of no value

127
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,666
You should only say what I tell you to say.

128
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:05,500
Take care that such behavior is not repeated again.

129
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,500
Goodnight!

130
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,708
Yes

131
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,250
We want to say something, your highness

132
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,208
All off

133
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,416
No

134
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,291
That means you want to say something. - Yes.

135
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,166
You can go

136
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,416
Good night

137
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:25,791
Tell me.

138
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,416
I want to go to the carnival, your highness.

139
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,875
Yes, but it's against our pride to watch the carnival with common people

140
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,875
But your highness Goodnight

141
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,916
Goodnight!

142
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,416
What is the younger princess doing?

143
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,833
She has been asleep since long, sir.

144
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,083
If you say then should I wake her up.

145
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:52,083
No need.

146
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,625
Hey sir!

147
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,416
Why are you waiting here all alone?

148
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,250
Hey girl! Get lost from here.

149
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,416
So, you want me to go away. Think it over.

150
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,791
Or else you might regret later.

151
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:18,625
C'mon, get lost

152
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,416
Hey, Asha it's you

153
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,375
What kind of a joke is this

154
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,583
What else could I do? My carnival excuse failed..

155
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,583
So I became a servant from a princess.

156
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,375
How do I look? - Nice!

157
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:31,916
You shouldn't come this way.

158
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:32,666
It's against our tradition..

159
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:33,500
Hey leader

160
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,958
I'm not here to listen to your lectures.

161
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,625
Let's go and see the carnival.

162
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,625
But.. - Don't worry, no one will recognize me.

163
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,416
Welcome Dr. Sanjay.

164
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,208
I'm the head secretary of his highness. Ranjit Singh.

165
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,708
Pleased to meet you. - Come,

166
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:01,750
highness is waiting for you.

167
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,041
Let's go.

168
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,583
Dr. Sanjay you must have visited many..

169
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:09,958
Not now

170
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,250
This is my first chance

171
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,416
So I will tell you the rules of this palace.

172
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,333
Pease do. I would be glad to know it.

173
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,041
When you stand in front of his highness"

174
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,500
then bow your head and salute three times.

175
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,250
What if I do it four times

176
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,416
No, this is against the tradition

177
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:24,958
Really?

178
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,625
Until his highness doesn't permit you to sit

179
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:28,875
you keep standing.

180
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:29,875
Oh I see.

181
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,916
But I hope he doesn't forget to permit me to sit.

182
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,333
If his highness asks you something"

183
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,791
Do give the answer by standing

184
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:37,625
anything else

185
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,041
That's all. Come.

186
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:43,041
Let go

187
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:55,500
Your highness Dr. Sanjay.

188
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,500
Good morning your highness.

189
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,375
Good morning.

190
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,625
By your fame I thought you would be aged.

191
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,625
Fame has nothing to do with age, your highness.

192
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,041
I'm so sorry.

193
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,500
I shouldn't have sat before asking you

194
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,041
I don't blame you, Dr. Sanjay. Please sit. Thank you.

195
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,416
Actually, today's generation is forgetting our culture..

196
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,000
And our old traditions

197
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,416
They think that every man is equal.

198
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,750
But this wrong.

199
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,750
This is not wrong, your highness

200
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,416
Today's generation is started realize their own rights

201
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,875
And.. - Ranjit Singh, is everyone informed..

202
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,958
YES

203
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,041
Before examining her I would like to know.. Something about your daughter.

204
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,208
You mean the princess

205
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:47,916
Yes

206
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,416
What do you want to know?

207
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,000
Is his presence necessary here

208
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:54,791
Can go

209
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,208
Yes

210
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,375
Tell me

211
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,416

I'm very sad.

213
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:14,583
'Take me in your arms

214
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:20,125

'Take me in your arms

218
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,333
What is this nonsense

219
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,500
How many times you have been informed..

220
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,416
Not to make any noise in this room.

221
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,416
The princess gets disturbed

222
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,250
You are the prince of this kingdom.

223
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,666
I'm sorry, your highness.

224
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,500

00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,416
Greetings, princess

229
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,416
May be you have been disturbed by them. You seem to be tired.

230
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,416
Your highness, if the princess" is tired

231
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,625
then I'll examine her later.

232
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,625
No! Do it now.

233
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,791
There's no need of that.

234
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,958
And not even this.

235
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,416
I know you can't walk.

236
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:32,500
I'm here to cure you.

237
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,291
I don't want to be cured

238
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,416
Princess, what kind of a behavior is this.

239
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,166
You don't know, but he's a very prestigious doctor.

240
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,500
Don't you want to be cured?

241
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,708
No

242
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,666
But we want

243
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,333
Whatever he asks, reply to him properly

244
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,958
Yes

245
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,791
Princess, I wanted to ask you is..

246
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,833
Good morning Your Highness good morning

247
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,416
Princess" injection

248
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,208
No! I don't want any injections.

249
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,208
I'm sick of it. I hate it.

250
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,083
But princess, it's very Important your health.

251
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,041
No I do not want injections

252
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:09,416
What is this childishness

253
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,500
Doctor, give her he injection

254
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,416
Doctor, which injection is

255
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,875
this. -B-12, for strength.

256
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,541
I would suggest that there's no need for the injection.

257
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,541
But his highness has ordered for the prescription

258
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,666
to be on time. That's why I can't be late.

259
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,416
But care doctor Sanjay

260
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:25,041
Your highness!

261
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,416
It would be better if you leave the medical work for a doctor.

262
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,416
Don't give her the injection. Your highness!

263
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,625
Do not give injections

264
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,166
Your highness, I want to ask something to the princess.

265
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:39,791
Go ahead

266
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,625
But in your presence it would be a bit..

267
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,833
You mean to say

268
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,833
Fine! I'll be waiting for you in the study.

269
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,500
Now, no one is here

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,416
Tell me, what problems do you have?

271
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,833
I can't walk

272
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,916
That i know

273
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,416
But what do you mean by you can't walk?

274
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,416
It means I don't know how to walk.

275
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,333
There's no life in my legs.

276
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,416
But you must have tried to walk.

277
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:17,708
Had initially

278
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,708
And then quit

279
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,041
Why you quit

280
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:26,041
It was useless to try to know

281
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:34,166
If I tell you to try walking before me..

282
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,666
Then will you agree to me

283
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,416
I'll help you too

284
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:41,791
These are my legs

285
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,416
You can examine as much as you wish

286
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,916
Prescribe medicines for it as you like

287
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,416
They will bring it very soon.

288
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:48,791
Tell his highness"

289
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,416
that these medicines will cure the princess very soon.

290
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:55,541
Take your fees and leave

291
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,125
It seems that you are tired of taking medicines.

292
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,416
I hate it.

293
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,166
But no one listens to me here.

294
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,375
I want to die.

295
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,416
But everyone wants me to be alive.

296
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,416
Sister

297
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,541
ake away all the medicines from here, immediately.

298
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,541
As you wish, doctor.

299
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,416
Now are you happy?

300
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,208
Ou should never hide anything from the doctor.

301
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,750
Or else how will he cure you?

302
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,875
Listen, I don't want any medicine or doctor or anything else.

303
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:31,541
Let me die peacefully.

304
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,625
I'm a doctor. I can't fulfill this wish.

305
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,208
It's against my principles.

306
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:42,708
Except death, you can ask for anything.

307
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,083
What do you need?

308
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,416
Loneliness!

309
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,416
Leave from her.

310
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:49,666
You are absolutely right

311
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:55,666
You are very tired. You need to rest.

312
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,583
Princess, please drink this juice.

313
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,583
If you don't like the juice then don't drink it.

314
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,875
For whom is that fifth plate for? Do we have any new guest?

315
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,041
Not a guest, but the medicine man. A new doctor.

316
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,416
So, he is still here?

317
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,541
Poor sister has to go through it.. all over again

318
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,833
Again new medicines and new injections!

319
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:41,500
And in the end the doctor will collect his fees and leave.

320
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,333
And our sister will be same as before.

321
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,416
Baby, his highness will never like this behavior.

322
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,041
He personally called the new doctor.

323
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:49,500
So what if he called him!

324
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,916
Nowadays all doctors are alike.

325
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,541
They see a rich man and they increase their treatment.

326
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,541
They don't care anything about the patient's illness.

327
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,958
All he cares about is the treasures of his highness.

328
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,291
Baby is absolutely right!

329
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,416
I'm very confident that these doctors are responsible for sister's ill health.

330
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,500
And this new doctor looks like a young lad.

331
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,875
How would he be able to cure our sister?

332
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,500
I think

333
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,250
he has stolen a degree from someone

334
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,250
Thanks you

335
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:22,833
Thanks for the compliment.

336
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,416
Doctor, did you listen to what we talking?

337
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:30,416
So what if I heard it? You were just complementing.

338
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,375
And probably you must have met doctors such as these.

339
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,291
You are right, doctor. With new doctors comes"

340
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,791
new injections, daily new medicines"

341
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,666
that tasteless boiled food

342
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,541
We Are tired just looking at them.

343
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,083
We can't even imagine what sister is going through

344
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:49,416
You'll be happy to hear that I have stopped" all her medicines and injections.

345
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:50,958
Really? Yes

346
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,083
That's' great. - Baby, apologize to him!

347
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:57,666
I'm sorry doctor. - It's alright, baby. It's all in the game.

348
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,500
Let's get introduced to each other.

349
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,083

And you are?

353
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,166
Don't ask of him, doctor.

354
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:11,416
Ask for the God who created him.

355
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,958
By the ways his good name is Prince Pratap Singh..

356
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:18,416
The next king of this kingdom

357
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:19,958

00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,750

Dr. Sanjay, do you have any problem staying here?

368
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:22,375
What problems can I have in your palace, your highness?

369
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:23,500
You see the place

370
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,416
Yes

371
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:27,500
You liked

372
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,791
Very much

373
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,750
Especially your zoo

374
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,875
When you saw it

375
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,625
Just take a look

376
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:39,416
Is quite priceless animals

377
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,125
Yes!

378
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,000
Dr. Sanjay, when Lord Mount Beton visited here

379
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,416
then he too saw our zoo

380
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,625
And after seeing that he said" your highness

381
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,250
I've never seen a zoo like this anywhere.

382
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,416
Your highness,

383
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:57,375
I've herd that your animals fear you very much.

384
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:01,500
Dr. Sanjay, I think they should fear me.

385
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,375
Dr. Sanjay, I believe I didn't introduce you to anyone.

386
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,416
Your highness we have been introduced. - Have you?

387
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:07,416
Yes.

388
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:10,666
The younger princess has introduced me well to all.

389
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,083
Very good!

390
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:15,500
Did the elder princess have her food?

391
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,416
Sir, she has again returned the food.

392
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:21,916
What's this? Why does she hate eating food?

393
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,500
If she continues like this then she'll ruin her health.

394
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,500
Your highness, don't worry. You can leave this to me, sir.

395
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,208
Good evening, princess

396
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:57,291
Today you are looking very nice.

397
00:26:57,791 --> 00:27:01,291
I mean you are looking very fresh.

398
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:03,291
Thank you

399
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:07,958
You have shown sympathy towards your patient even after being a doctor.

400
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:11,208
Now I can die peacefully.

401
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:15,208
You'll live peacefully.

402
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,416
Wouldn't a patient die without medicine?

403
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:21,416
Sometimes he even gets cured

404
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,000
And the medicines which show no effect.

405
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,875
Should be stopped immediately. Like..

406
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:28,083
The food is served

407
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,416
What's this, you haven't eaten your food yet

408
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,250
Even after my orders, food has been served so late

409
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,708
I have to complain about this to his highness

410
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:36,416
No No No

411
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:37,666
Please don't complain about him.

412
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:40,166
Or else he'll be fired from his job.

413
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:41,833
I had returned the food myself

414
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:44,208
I don't want to eat. Take it away.

415
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,791
No

416
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,583
You were tired of taking medicines so I stopped it.

417
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:51,625
That doesn't mean

418
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,750
I will agree to all your demands.

419
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,750
Sister, bring the tray here

420
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:03,625
Doctor,

421
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,791
why does a human need to eat food?

422
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:09,333
To live!

423
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,416
And the person who has no wish to live.

424
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:12,958
I don't want to listen to anything.

425
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,416
Have your food.

426
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:16,791
Such delicious food and

427
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,791
and you don't want to eat it!

428
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,416
Doctor, this food is not meant for me.

429
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,416
Waiter must have brought it by mistake.

430
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:30,875
I eat half cooked food. Tasteless and boiled.

431
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,666
I'm not fortunate to eat such food.

432
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,583
From now onwards you'll have this food.

433
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:39,083
No, his highness will never like this.

434
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:41,500
I'm the doctor, not his highness

435
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,208
I will decide what the patient should be fed, not his highness.

436
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:51,208
Today you'll definitely eat this food.

437
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:57,416
Not just today, from now onwards you'll be served this.

438
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:09,416
C'mon, eat up.

439
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,166
Good morning, princess.

440
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,791
Good morning, doctor.

441
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:44,500
When did you arrive?

442
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,416
When you were lost in your dreams.

443
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:52,666
What did you write

444
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,500
Nothing

445
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,500
Don't hide it from me

446
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,750
I know that you are great poetess.

447
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,416
I'm neither great nor a poetess

448
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:05,416
I just write something.

449
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:07,333
That too for myself.

450
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:10,625
Princess, a poetess should never be selfish.

451
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:14,375
Her message, her principles, her thoughts"

452
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,416
should be for everyone

453
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:17,500
And I would say that

454
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,916
poetesses are for others only.

455
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:22,166
Let me read what you have written

456
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:24,875
Don't read it. It's nothing special.

457
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:28,875
That will be only decided after reading it.

458
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:41,375
No matter how much death is our enemy

459
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:44,416
This is very nice.

460
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,416
No matter how much death is our enemy

461
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:51,916
it likes life itself

462
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:55,416
The poem is nice but the thoughts are wrong

463
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:57,916
Why?

464
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:00,000
Because life is a fact

465
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,833
and death is just a thought.

466
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,791
Life gives a person a chance to try his strength.

467
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,208
And death takes everything away

468
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,750
If humans just started thinking of death

469
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,791
then this world would have ended long back.

470
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,083
So a poet should always think of useful things.

471
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:16,500
Doctor!

472
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,416
Well, forget all this

473
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:23,833
Please recite the poem which was left unfinished that day.

474
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,125
Which one?

475
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:26,791
The same one

476
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:31,416
take me in your arms for I'm very sad.

477
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:35,416
In the same trance

478
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:49,166
Take me in your arms,

479
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:54,416
for I'm very sad.'

480
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:59,916
'Free from this world

481
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:05,291
for I'm very sad.'

482
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:09,291
Take me in your arms,

483
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:27,625
'l can't bear this sorrow of waiting anymore.'

484
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:45,750
'My love is suffering I can't tolerate it anymore.'

485
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:56,583
'Call me towards you, for I'm very sad

486
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:02,125
'Free from this world

487
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:07,625
for I'm very sad.'

488
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:11,625
Take me in your arms,

489
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:37,708
'I've traveled a lot on the paths of life

490
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:48,166
'Please, hide me in your arms.'

491
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:53,750
'Don't ignore my question,

492
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,250
for I'm very sad.'

493
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,416
'Free from this world,

494
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:10,000
for I'm very sad.'

495
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,000
Take me in your arms

496
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:42,041
Every breath is growing a thirst to meet you

497
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:52,875
'By body is heating up and my soul is on fire

498
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:58,416
If you can then please save me

499
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:03,416
for I'm very sad.'

500
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:08,833
'Free from this world

501
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:14,416
for I'm very sad.'

502
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:18,416
Take me in your arms,

503
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:27,250
Excellent

504
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,541
That is a great poem.

505
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:34,500
Now I know why you don't want to be cured.

506
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,500
Princess, can I ask you something?

507
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:47,083
Have you have ever loved someone?

508
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:48,708
I still do.

509
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:53,375
He must be very unfortunate to deny your love

510
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:57,375
Who is he?

511
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:02,666
Death

512
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:03,791
I don't understand

513
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:06,500
why you love death so much!

514
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,416
Princess, you should love life.

515
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,416
You'll be cured of all your miseries

516
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,416
Can I come in?

517
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:19,416
Come in, young princess.

518
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,250
What's this? The royal tongue

519
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,041
Even I can see that. But why are you showing it to me?

520
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,791
The doctor, who treats our sister, is known as a royal doctor.

521
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:34,416
And we have to get a medical check-up from him, daily.

522
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,250
Why every day?

523
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,416
What happens here is Your Highness's orders

524
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,416
And to ask questions like why and what is a crime here.

525
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:44,333
And to ask questions like why and what is a crime here.

526
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:47,500
I see. Understood

527
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,333
Okay, show me your tongues.

528
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,625
You both are really sick Kya?

529
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:57,333
You feel little a suffocating. And you too, prince

530
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:58,333
Wonderful!

531
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:01,333
You are the first doctor to recognize our illness

532
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:01,916
What say Princess

533
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:03,250
Correct princess

534
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,500
But any cure for this

535
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,708
The only cure is you need some fresh air.

536
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:09,625
Go in the garden and have some fresh air.

537
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:10,500
And you princess

538
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,916
Oh my God! He's here.

539
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,958
Who is here? Royal guest

540
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:19,041
is highness, King Ghanak Singh, l.D.l.O.T. is arriving.

541
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,875
You mean, idiot!

542
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,541
Why is here?

543
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,666
He is in search for a bride. A royal bride!

544
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:29,666
Princes, congratulation!

545
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,541
His highness of Himatpur, the royal guest.

546
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:58,541
His highness, king Ghanak Singh of Kamgad, is arriving

547
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:14,250
Your highness, she is my daughter princess Hemlatadevi

548
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,041
And you know that King Ghanak Singh's royal family is the oldest in India.

549
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:20,416
Your highness, forgive me to interrupt you

550
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,333
We have known each other since our ancestors.

551
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:27,250
But I'm sorry to say that the princess has disrespected me

552
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,750
Even after knowing that I'm from a respected family..

553
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,416
She didn't stand up to greet me.

554
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:34,416
Our highness, you were already informed..

555
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:37,416
That the princess is ill. She can't walk.

556
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:39,500
You only insisted to meet me

557
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,416
Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot

558
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,416
Secretary, why didn't you told me that

559
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:46,000
the princess is lame

560
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,791
Your highness, you need to rest

561
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,500
No, your highness. I'll only leave after I'm forgiven.

562
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,208
Secretary, apologize. Please, accept my apologies

563
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:58,083
Our secretary is apologizing. She is apologizing. We all are apologizing.

564
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,500
Your highness

565
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,916
This condition of the Princess I miss my Princess

566
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:05,708
Your highness

567
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:06,791
you mean to say

568
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,291
I don't mean my sister

569
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,375
but my racing mare.

570
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,416
Your highness, she was wonderful mare

571
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:15,416
She would win me 1000 guineas, 2000 guineas"

572
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:19,833
3000 guineas, oaks, derbies, St. Ledgers"

573
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,416
and made our name more famous than ever.

574
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:26,416
Your highness, one day what happened is..

575
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:29,125
In the morning when she was being trained

576
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,416
she suddenly had an ache in her leg.

577
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:37,000
What can I say more? She was in such an agony.

578
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,166
Your highness, we had to call a doctor from England"

579
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:45,416
from America, but she didn't get any relief from the pain

580
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:48,041
And the day came when..

581
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:50,708
Secretary, you tell ahead.

582
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,708
The king couldn't bear it anymore

583
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:55,416
and one day I committed suicide.

584
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:57,625
Not you! He means, your highness"

585
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,375
the mare was made to commit suicide.

586
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,416
I mean, that I shot the mare

587
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:05,083
When a mare becomes lame she should be shot.

588
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,583
Your highness, please.

589
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,500
Excuse me, your highness.

590
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,500
As being a doctor for the princess I would request you

591
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,250
that you escort your royal guest away from here

592
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,250
Oh, I'm sorry. Princess, I'm very sorry.

593
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:29,791
Princess,

594
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:33,208
you shouldn't care of what people say

595
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:35,250
If I knew that

596
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,416
hese royal guests are so ill mannered..

597
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:40,791
Then I would have never allowed them to come in here

598
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:43,416
They are not to be blamed doctor.

599
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:47,416
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have cried this way.

600
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,708
But I loke you cry

601
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:50,875
Why

602
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:53,416
Because it proves that you don't want to die

603
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:57,416
You still have the wish to live, inside you.

604
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,416
Now, let me have that smile of yours.

605
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:09,416
Terrible

606
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,000
His highness, King Ghanak Singh is arriving.

607
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,541
Your Excellency, I'm sorry. I'm late again.

608
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,416
I'm very sorry that I'm late again.

609
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,291
Princess, is our program for the riding fixed?

610
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,500
I've told my secretary not to wake me up early tomorrow.

611
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,250
You told me to wake you up early, my lord.

612
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,291
Please, sit. - Please have seat, your highness. - Please, sit

613
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:37,041
What were you saying

614
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,500
You said to wake me early sir

615
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,125
Yes, I told him to wake me up early.

616
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,416
Early in the morning, before sunshine"

617
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:46,916
at 10.30, wake me up.

618
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:48,625
Your highness, will you keep him with you?

619
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:52,208
I can't live alone without him.

620
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:55,416
And even he can't eat anything without me

621
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,250
I was already worried for myself

622
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,416
But I'm also worried about him too.

623
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:01,166
I didn't understand you, your highness.

624
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:04,083
I want him to get married in a royal family.

625
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:05,416
Royal family?

626
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:09,416
I mean to say the royal family of dogs.

627
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,416
If this happen then I will be very delighted

628
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,750
Your highness, should the dinner be served?

629
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,916
What's the hurry! I'll tell you more about him.

630
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,791
This is my puppy!

631
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:25,375
Your Excellency, have you heard of..

632
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,916
Have u heard the name of bachelor

633
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:29,125
You didn't

634
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:30,416
Strange

635
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:34,416
The grandmother of my four grandmothers before, she was going to England.

636
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:38,083
So her daughter Ms. Josephine had a dog.

637
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:41,416
And this is the blood relative of that dog

638
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,416
I think, your highness, the dinner should be served.

639
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:47,083
What's the hurry?

640
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:48,500
Secretary, give me some water

641
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,500
So sweet.

642
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:59,583
Your Excellency you must have seen me drink this water.

643
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:01,125
You should know that

644
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:02,416
I don't drink any other plane's water

645
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:04,625
I only drink water from my state"

646
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,416
and the water is supplied by airplane.

647
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:07,916
Secretary, has the water arrived?

648
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:09,208
Yes, the plane has arrived from water

649
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:10,416
Yes, the plane has arrived from water?

650
00:46:10,916 --> 00:46:12,375
You mean the water has arrived by plane. - Yes.

651
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:16,375
Very good. He's a bit..

652
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:19,958
Secretary

653
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:23,791
Your Excellency " your highness"

654
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,000
you don't know my secretary well

655
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,416
He's a very useful man.

656
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:31,375
Secretary, just speak like dogs do.

657
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,375
The one you taught me? Yes, the same Quickly

658
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:47,416
No! With the voice

659
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:55,416
Very good. Now the calf" that cow talk.

660
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:59,166
Now that of a goat

661
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:01,541
Forgive me, your highness, but I have some urgent work.

662
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:05,291
Very good

663
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:06,500
Where is my dog?

664
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,541
Your highness!

665
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,583
I never eat without my dog.

666
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:11,291
I can never eat without him.

667
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:15,000
Where's my dog? Oh, he's under here.

668
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:20,333
You are under here! Don't leave me like this.

669
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,750
I get worried without you

670
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,416
Your highness, you are great. Congratulations!

671
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:28,958
His highness left being defeated by you.

672
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:31,000
What are you saying? Really?

673
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,833
But our program is fixed, isn't it? Isn't it?

674
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,416
We'll see to that later

675

00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:51,625
'If the aim is not achieved then it might be faith.

731
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:55,666
'If the aim is not achieved then it might be faith.

732
00:53:56,166 --> 00:54:00,500
'It's about that!'

733
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,416
'The one which is called love, it's about that.'

734
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:10,416
'The one which is called love, it's about that.'

735
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:15,541
'The one which is called love, it's about that.'

736
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:19,541
'The one which is called love, it's about that.'

737
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,416
Yes Doctor

738
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:42,916
Your Highness

739
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:45,375
the new doctor has stopped all medicines and injections

740
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:47,416
And even have discontinued with the brace.

741
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:49,166
If this continues then the princess

742
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:50,625
You want to complain?

743
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:51,500
No sir.

744
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,416
You must know that Dr. Sanjay is a very capable man

745
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:58,416
Yes

746
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:03,416
Good morning

747
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:05,416
Good morning Excuse me

748
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:06,500
I've heard that you have..

749
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,916
Discontinued all her medicine and injections.

750
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:10,041
You have even stopped with the brace

751
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:13,416
Doe it mean that you have glven up? Glve up?

752
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:16,250
Your highness, I'm confident that the princess will be cured

753
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:17,166
Thank you, doctor

754
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:18,208
Thank you,

755
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:21,208
I knew that I was not wrong about you

756
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:25,708
Doctor, I'm so happy to hear this that I would..

757
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:29,000
Doctor, tomorrow we are going out on a hunting trip

758
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,416
If you are interested then you are invited to join us We'll be happy

759
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:33,708
I'll be honored, your highness.

760
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:35,041
But I have small request

761
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:38,250
The princess will join us too.

762
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,416
But how can the princess go? You know that..

763
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:44,208
Is it advisable to take the princes out?

764
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:45,750
Your highness, I'm a doctor.

765
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,083
And I'm well aware of my responsibilities

766
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:52,083
trust me

767
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:18,083
The tiger is dead

768
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:22,083
Give me some water

769
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:34,416
Princess, this is death, which you are in love with.

770
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:38,416
Look at it.

771
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:45,833
Let's go

772
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:53,416
If you keep your foot on the head then it would look better

773
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:57,208
Foot on the head? Good idea.

774
00:59:57,708 --> 00:59:59,500
Secretary, hold this.

775
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,416
No, not on your head

776
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:03,208
On the tiger's head

777
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:07,208
Oh, on tigers"

778
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:16,666
Photographer, how would I look if I keep both my feet on his head?

779
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:21,500
Keep one foot on the head of this innocent child" and the other on her mother, your highness

780
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,208
The photograph will be much better

781
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:24,958
Very good idea

782
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:28,958
One on the child and the other one the mother..

783
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:32,416
What is he saying, secretary

784
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:35,625
One on the child and the other one the mother..

785
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:38,500
My lord!

786
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,541
Look what this man is blabbering about.

787
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:42,166
I can't understand a thing.

788
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:46,416
You don't worry about him.

789
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:47,583
Randhir Singh,

790
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:48,958
the doors of my palace"

791
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:51,041
are open for all of my people

792
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,708
But that doesn't mean you can barge in anytime.

793
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:55,166
Whatever you have to say..

794
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:57,000
I don't want to say anything.

795
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:01,750
This innocent child and his mother are here for justice

796
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:03,416
Justice for what

797
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:08,416
While hunting the tiger his husband was killed

798
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:12,250
I ordered that the family of the deceased should be

799
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:15,500
But Randhir Singh told them to not take the compensation

800
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,500
Why

801
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,083
Hence your highness

802
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:20,041
Tuljaram, didn't was not killed by the tiger"

803
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:22,416
but by the bullet fired by your royal guest.

804
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:24,708
Don't you dare speak against our royal guest!

805
01:01:25,208 --> 01:01:27,500
My lord.. how did he knew

806
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,875
My lord, he's lying. He's absolutely lying

807
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:34,833
My lord, excuse me. For I must rest.

808
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:37,875
Secretary, you take the pictures. Yes, sir

809
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:40,875
Now do you believe us, your highness

810
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:44,500
The truth is that Tuljaram was killed by this tiger

811
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,416
If you have any doubts then you can go the court

812
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:49,166
What's the use of going to the court, your highness

813
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:52,000
Judge, doctor, police everyone will say what you want.

814
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,416
You are the King of this state

815
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:56,416
Your orders are the law and justice of this state.

816
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:57,666
You are insulting me

817
01:01:58,166 --> 01:01:59,083
You mean to say that I'm lying

818
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:00,500
Forgive me, your highness

819
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,666
You are intentionally lying to save your royal guest

820
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:07,000
Or else would have been in jail right now

821
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,333
Throw them out of the palace, immediately

822
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:11,500
You can definitely throw us out of the palace.

823
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,958
But you cannot suppress the truth

824
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:16,666
You may regret it in the future

825
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,083
Fear the curses of the poor

826
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:20,500
They can even burn down castles of gold

827
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,916
Ranjit Singh! Guard!

828
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:27,666
Stop

829
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:29,750
There's no need for this, your highness

830
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,750
Did you see, brothers

831
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:37,041
They have been trampling us like this from the beginning

832
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:37,708
Come here, lady

833
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:40,291
You came here for justice, didn't you?

834
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:43,416
Did you get any justice here? This is the justice they have been giving

835
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:47,291
since their ancestors and it will still continue this way

836
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:49,750
I would remind you again, your highness.

837
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:51,416
Fear the curses of poor people like us.

838
01:02:51,916 --> 01:02:55,041
Or these curses will burn this palace down one day

839
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:59,041
Let's go, brothers

840
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:07,500
Yes, tell me. What do you want

841
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,625
Sir, it's something important

842
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:14,875
Princess! It's you?

843
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,291
Now, what's all this

844
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:17,916
It's a real dangerous situation. So, I've come here

845
01:03:18,416 --> 01:03:18,916
Big deal about your dangerous situation.

846
01:03:19,416 --> 01:03:21,416
Listen, it's not good that you come here.

847
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:25,916
If someone sees you then you'll be in big trouble

848
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:29,333
Come here.

849
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:31,916
Go from here. Your life is in danger

850
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:32,666
Why

851
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:35,500
Because you exposed King Dhanaj Singh.

852
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,291
I'd have hanged him if I could

853
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:40,416
You can do that later

854
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:42,916
Now, maybe you'll hanged today

855
01:03:43,416 --> 01:03:45,416
His highness has given orders to arrest you

856
01:03:45,916 --> 01:03:49,166
This is great news! Our job will be made much easier

857
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:50,708
The public will become against monarchy

858
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:53,416
Randhir, you forget. This is monarchy

859
01:03:53,916 --> 01:03:57,416
If you get caught, no one will come to know about you.

860
01:03:57,916 --> 01:03:59,333
Please run away from here for my sake

861
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:01,583
I don't get one thing

862
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:04,416
I'm your father's enemy.

863
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:06,791
I speak against him

864
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:10,500
Then, why are you trying to save me

865
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,416
Should I explain even this to you

866
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:16,000
The police have encircled you from outside

867
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,291
Is there any other way to escape from here?

868
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:20,166
No, this is the only way

869
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:22,416
The police might be there.

870
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:25,416
Listen.

871
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:29,416
Go fast

872
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:41,875
Hey, girl. Where are you going

873
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:43,416
No one can go from in here

874
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:50,166
Sir, our ma'am wants the news of her daughter" getting married, to be published in the newspaper

875
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:52,958
Did anyone ever get married by publishing it in the newspapers?

876
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:55,416
That's what I was trying to make her understand

877
01:04:55,916 --> 01:04:57,875
But, she doesn't listen to me

878
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,500
Sir, please make my ma'am understand.

879
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,333
All right. I'll make her understand.

880
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:06,333
Mfam

881
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,750
Ma'am, marriages don't get done by giving the news in newspapers.

882
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,500
Okay sir shall we go

883
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,500
Go from here

884
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:28,416
Yes, good riddance

885
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:30,541
Where will you meet

886
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:34,541
In Parvati's temple

887
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:38,250
Your highness,

888
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:40,500
we expect you to come back from Delhi soon

889
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,500
Can't say. Maybe it'll take some time

890
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:58,375
Bye, bye your highness

891
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:01,041
what happen

892
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:01,958
Why are you shouting like this

893
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,958
Prince Rajendra Singh, shout along with me. Shout Hurray.

894
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:06,791
Tell me

895
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:08,500
But, what if his highness hears us

896
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,333
He went to Delhi. What?!

897
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,958
And he was telling that he wouldn't return soon

898
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:15,666
Now shout Hurray

899
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:17,791
Hurray!

900
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:22,875
Hark everyone! Pay attention

901
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:26,875
No. Don't hark anyone! Don't pay attention!

902
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:36,708
'The king is not at home. We're not scared of anyone.'

903
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:42,416
'We'll shout it a hundred times with our head held high.'

904
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:46,416
'Don't hark anyone! Don't pay attention

905
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:50,500
'Hark everyone! Pay attention

906
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,250
'The king is not at home. We're not scared of anyone.'

907
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:01,750
'We'll shout it a hundred times with our head held high.'

908
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:05,791
'Don't hark anyone! Don't pay attention

909

Doctor, shall I ask you something

946
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,625
- Yes, princess

947
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:14,083
Will my legs be all right if you take me around this corridor?

948
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:18,500
Princess, this is nothing. want to take you around mountains

949
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,958
Will you take me around in this wheelchair

950
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:24,958
Maybe, you won't require this

951
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:41,875
Doctor you'll take me there

952
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:45,875
Sure

953
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:07,208
I used to sit here for hours

954
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:10,125
I used to play here

955
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:11,916
Hopefully

956
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:13,416
Why did you stop?

957
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:14,625
Will that day will come back

958
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:17,791
Princess, there is nothing called impossible in this world

959
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:21,250
You need some courage and some efforts.

960
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:24,041
Unfortunately, my legs are not able

961
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:27,625
to feel the freshness of the water

962
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,416
Who is obstructing you

963
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:31,333
Won't I get cold

964
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:35,333
This doctor's with you

965
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:53,000
It feels very nice. I've always loved water.

966
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,625
Princess, you should come here every day

967
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,791
This water, the fresh air

968
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,958
the breeze, the expanse of the sky.

969
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:06,208
These are all invaluable medicines for your health

970
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:12,791
Doctor, will you go away if I get well

971
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:16,000
Princess, I'll have to go at any cost.

972
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:20,000
If you get well and even if you don't.

973
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:24,208
It'll be a big thing for me if you get well.

974
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:26,333
Or else his highness will think that..

975
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:30,416
Too am greedy for wealth like the others.

976
01:13:30,916 --> 01:13:33,916
Tell me, how do you want to send me

977
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:36,250
I don't want to send you anywhere

978
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,875
How is that possible

979
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:43,416
You said just now that there's nothing called impossible" in this world

980
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:47,333
All you need is some courage and efforts.

981
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:51,333
Do you have the courage?

982
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:57,583
Then you'll become all right very soon.

983
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:22,083
The night is so beautiful. It's so young 'I've lost my control.'

984

Princess!

1006
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:53,958
Princess, come to your senses

1007
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:57,625
What happened to you? How did you come here

1008
01:18:58,125 --> 01:19:01,083
Where is the nurse Princess!

1009
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:02,833
Do you look after the patient this way

1010
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:05,416
Where did you leave the patient and go

1011
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:08,416
It's not the nurse's mistake

1012
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:10,250
I came here alone.

1013
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:14,250
Why?

1014
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,000
Please carry me

1015
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:59,250
What did you do

1016
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,416
You shouldn't have ventured out alone

1017
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:06,500
I was entranced by your voice

1018
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,416
I couldn't control myself

1019
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:14,583
Just like the cool breeze

1020
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:18,541
the fragrance of the flowers..

1021
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:23,541
The freshness of the monsoon entrances a man.

1022
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:29,416
The same way your song affected me.

1023
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:32,166
Did you like my song so much

1024
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:34,583
You should have called me immediately.

1025
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:37,416
I'd have come before you

1026
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:42,125
There are many things, which can't be explained

1027
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:45,416
you've to understand them yourself.

1028
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,333
You are a princess

1029
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:50,916
You must not do anything without thinking twice

1030
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:54,625
Did you hear lqbal's poetry

1031
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:57,416
'It's natural that you want to be close to your heart

1032
01:20:57,916 --> 01:21:00,833
'But sometimes you must leave it alone

1033
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:04,875
You must leave it alone sometime. 'Now I want to leave it alone

1034
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:09,750
'Now I want to leave it alone

1035
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,416
Princess.

1036
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:16,625
Hema. My name is Hemlata

1037
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:20,625
You can call me Hema

1038
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:33,041
We must tell the Indian Government

1039
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:35,583
that the British Government ruled over us for 200 years

1040
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:38,083
But they never thought of abolishing monarchy.

1041
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:42,041
They considered monarchy important.

1042
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:46,000
Then why does the Indian Government think that..

1043
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,125
Monarchy is a threat to the country?

1044
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,750
When the foreign power placed their trust on us..

1045
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,208
Then why doesn't our government trust us?

1046
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:55,875
You are wrong.

1047
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:58,416
The Indian government trusts you.

1048
01:21:58,916 --> 01:21:59,916
They've complete faith in you

1049
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,250
But they want this country

1050
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,500
which is split in to many parts to unite again.

1051
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,250
For the unity of the country"

1052
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:09,916
There should be a good administration.

1053
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:13,416
We want only one government

1054
01:22:13,916 --> 01:22:15,666
and only one flag.

1055
01:22:16,166 --> 01:22:16,500
I'm sorry.

1056
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,416
But this is just an excuse to annex the kingdoms.

1057
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:21,708
You had promised the British that after they leave

1058
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:24,041
you'll allow our freedom to go on.

1059
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:27,125
To break one's promise is a shame to any government.

1060
01:22:27,625 --> 01:22:29,708
If the Indian government doesn't understand this

1061
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:33,416
then we've to think of our own defense.

1062
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:36,166
Hey Randhir,

1063
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:37,375
Hey Randhir,

1064
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:39,166
are you annoyed?

1065
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:40,250
Randhir,

1066
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,791
Prince Rajender Singh was showing off his skills.

1067
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,333
And I was forced but to watch his show.

1068
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:46,500
I'll promise that

1069
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,041
I'll never be late again.

1070
01:22:48,541 --> 01:22:49,000
All right?

1071
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,791
No, Asha. That's not the matter.

1072
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:53,416
Actually, I'm fed up of my life.

1073
01:22:53,916 --> 01:22:55,416
What's the use of my life?

1074
01:22:55,916 --> 01:22:56,833
Why am I living after all?

1075
01:22:57,333 --> 01:22:58,083
Your life is in danger.

1076
01:22:58,583 --> 01:22:58,833
That's why?

1077
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:00,041
I'm not concerned about my life.

1078
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:01,416
But I'm.

1079
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:03,375
Don't I have any right on you?

1080
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:05,041
Asha, try to understand

1081
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:06,583
We're hiding from the reality.

1082
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:09,416
We're trying to puff against the storm.

1083
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:12,333
Everyone in the city knows that I'm an ordinary man.

1084
01:23:12,833 --> 01:23:13,416
I'm the son of the coachman"

1085
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:15,333
who is the servant of your father.

1086
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:18,250
This is like the horizon, which can never be found.

1087
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:19,125
I can't believe that you are saying this!

1088
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:23,250
If this is the thing, then we shouldn't meet again.

1089
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:23,791
I thought that you had the courage"

1090
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,208
to move against all odds

1091
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:28,041
Asha,

1092
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:29,250
Asha,

1093
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:30,416
Asha,

1094
01:23:30,916 --> 01:23:31,625
You talk about being angry?

1095
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:32,666
Angry?

1096
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:34,583
I ask you, why are you deceiving this world?

1097
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:35,416
Deceiving

1098
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:36,416
And so what?

1099
01:23:36,916 --> 01:23:39,333
You wanted everyone to be on the same level.

1100
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:40,416
You had told that all

1101
01:23:40,916 --> 01:23:42,208
human beings are equal.

1102
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:43,833
Say that everything is a lie.

1103
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:44,958
Everything is a deceit.

1104
01:23:45,458 --> 01:23:48,291
If you can't say it to the world, then say it to me.

1105
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:49,625
Asha

1106
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,291
Neither can I lie to the world

1107
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:53,791
Nor to you.

1108
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:58,083
I've accepted only two things in life.

1109
01:23:58,583 --> 01:24:00,416
One is Asha and the

1110
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:02,208
second is principles.

1111
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:03,166
Randhir

1112
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:06,000
Asha

1113
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,000
Hey, your highness. It's a surprise!

1114
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:09,583
Yes

1115
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:10,375
You were supposed to be in Delhi.

1116
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:11,125
Yes.

1117
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:11,500
I had been there

1118
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,375
Some strange talk was going on.

1119
01:24:13,875 --> 01:24:14,750
Highly renowned people were talking there.

1120
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,625
I thought to come here and have some romance.

1121
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:18,958
Wait. Where are you going?

1122
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:20,791
I've some important work. You can have some rest.

1123
01:24:21,291 --> 01:24:22,125
All right

1124
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,250
I'm a little tired I'll take some rest.

1125
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:28,250
Bye! Bye!

1126
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:38,375
Prince Rajender Singh!

1127
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:39,541
How long did you take!

1128
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:41,416
Have you seen forest owls?

1129
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:42,416
Forest owlsl?

1130
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:43,291
What is that?

1131
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:45,333
See over there.

1132
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:46,416
Ohh

1133
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:50,291
The forest owls.

1134
01:24:50,791 --> 01:24:51,500
Let's hunt them down

1135
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,500
Listen.

1136
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:03,333
Your highness,

1137
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:04,958
if you continue your singing"

1138
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:06,666
then not even one fish will get snared.

1139
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:08,416
Ahhh

1140
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:09,208
Secretary

1141
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:10,000
Yes highness,

1142
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,666
The majesty is very innocent

1143
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:12,416
Yes

1144
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:16,416
He doesn't know anything about music.

1145
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:17,583
You are still a kid.

1146
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:18,541
Hmmm

1147
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:18,791
Hey, Sir

1148
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:22,625
This is that music when sung by Tansen..

1149
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,541
"Lighted the lamps.

1150
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:25,083
Yess

1151
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:28,916
And when sung by Tari, it rained.

1152
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:34,708
When I sing this music, fishes fly out and fall in my lap.

1153
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:36,416
You don't know anything.

1154
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:38,000
Your highness, how can I make you understand.

1155
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:38,625
Secratary

1156
01:25:39,125 --> 01:25:40,291
Yes, highness

1157
01:25:40,791 --> 01:25:41,500
We are goofy?

1158
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,500
Who said you donkey?

1159
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:44,541
This gentleman says so.

1160
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:45,750
Your highness, the fish has been caught.

1161
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:46,416
See their

1162
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:47,333

Where?

1164
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:49,125
Oyyee

1165
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:49,916
Hey, sir

1166
01:25:49,916 --> 01:25:50,500
What are you doing.

1167
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,500
Catch me or I'll fall

1168
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,083
Is this a fish or a whale?

1169
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:55,833
It's getting close, your highness.

1170
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:57,958
It's pulling me in.

1171
01:25:58,458 --> 01:25:59,916
Catch me

1172
01:26:00,416 --> 01:26:00,541
Leave me

1173
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:02,416
Do you think I'm a coward?

1174
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:03,333
Move aside.

1175
01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:05,833
It's my fish. I'll catch it.

1176
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:07,875
Catch it.

1177
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:08,416
Hold him.

1178
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:09,583
Your highness

1179
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:12,750
Your highness has fallen down.

1180
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:16,750
Someone help him.

1181
01:26:19,791 --> 01:26:22,000
Please help him

1182
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,583
his highness.

1183
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:31,416
His highness.

1184
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:33,583
Rajender Singh, what is uncultured behavior!

1185
01:26:34,083 --> 01:26:34,916
Prince, this is not

1186
01:26:35,416 --> 01:26:37,208
uncultured behavior

1187
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:39,916
His highness, it's unfortunate!

1188
01:26:40,416 --> 01:26:42,375
What will I reply to your mother if you leave us and go?

1189
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:43,583
What will I reply to your subjects?

1190
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:45,416
What will I say to this queen?

1191
01:26:45,916 --> 01:26:47,416
Don't cry. He'll regain his consciousness soon.

1192
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:50,375
He'll become all right now. Please don't be scared.

1193
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:54,375
He'll become completely all right.

1194
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:21,708
One day I told you

1195
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:22,291
I wanted to take you.

1196
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:24,583
Around these mountains.

1197
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:28,416
Remember?

1198
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:31,250
But you had even told that

1199
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:35,041
I wouldn't require this chair.

1200
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:36,875
I agree

1201
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:38,583
But I'm helpless

1202
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:40,958
It seems you are in love with this chair.

1203
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:42,416
Why not?

1204
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:46,500
It has been supporting me since the past 5 years.

1205
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,958
When I go far from this, it seems like..

1206
01:27:49,458 --> 01:27:50,958
It's calling out for

1207
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:54,583
me to come near.

1208
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:58,208
There are many others who want you to be close to them..

1209
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:02,208
Who?

01:34:05,666 --> 01:34:06,416
Don't just stay there.

1271
01:34:06,916 --> 01:34:07,500
Come fast!

1272
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,916
Sister has started walking.

1273
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:12,916
Come here

1274
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:14,250
What were you doing?

1275
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:17,500
You should not make haste.

1276
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,708
You're certainly determined now.

1277
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:22,000
But your legs are still weak.

1278
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,875
But, I just tried to walk 7 steps.

1279
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:28,541
You can't walk 7 steps alone.

1280
01:35:29,041 --> 01:35:32,541
You can't walk 7 steps alone.

1281
01:38:20,166 --> 01:38:24,541
Hark everyone! Pay attention!

1282
01:38:25,041 --> 01:38:28,541
Princess Hema is arriving.

1283
01:38:59,208 --> 01:39:02,708
Sister, you are looking like a fairy princess today.

1284
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,375
What is this childishness!

1285
01:39:10,875 --> 01:39:12,958
Sister, you've no idea of our happiness today.

1286
01:39:13,458 --> 01:39:14,666
Raju, I know it.

1287
01:39:15,166 --> 01:39:17,166
I never believed that a man could come back"

1288
01:39:17,666 --> 01:39:19,416
.from the dead. But today I believe that.

1289
01:39:19,916 --> 01:39:26,375
Before today whenever my birthday arrived..

1290
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:30,416
I used to think that I've lost one year of my life.

1291
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:34,416
I felt I'm close to death..

1292
01:39:34,916 --> 01:39:38,416
But today I believe that I'm close to life.

1293
01:39:53,583 --> 01:39:57,416
Sanjay, you've given me this new life.

1294
01:39:57,916 --> 01:40:01,416
Hema,

1295
01:40:03,791 --> 01:40:05,083
someone is waiting for you. -

1296
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:09,375
Who?

1297
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:13,375
It's before you.

1298
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:43,500
Many happy returns of the day, princess.

1299
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:44,583
Not this one

1300
01:40:45,083 --> 01:40:46,083
Happy birthday!

That is gift for my side

1302
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,666
Doctor, happy birthday to you too.

1303
01:40:53,166 --> 01:40:55,416
It's not mine, but princess's birthday.

1304
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:56,666
Never mind

1305
01:40:57,166 --> 01:41:02,750

Secretary,

1313
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,416
My poor dog.

1314
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:19,500
This noise always frightens her.

1315
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,500
Come here, dear.

1316
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:30,500

We have received the news that monarchy has ended.

1322
01:41:48,916 --> 01:41:50,375
All monarchies have ended.

1323
01:41:50,875 --> 01:41:53,625
They have been annexed to India

1324
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:57,625
So these celebrations are going on in this city.

1325
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:04,416
Ook at the Tricolor waving high in the air.

1326
01:42:04,916 --> 01:42:07,208
The flag of independence.

1327
01:42:07,708 --> 01:42:08,500

01:42:09,916 --> 01:42:09,958
Give it to me.

1330
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:11,333

01:42:18,125 --> 01:42:21,833
It's really shameful!

1334
01:42:22,333 --> 01:42:25,833
Button up your coat. You too.

1335
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:37,333
His pride is the same as before. Monarchy has ended.

1336
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:51,125
Princess.

01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:54,416
Dad

1338
01:42:54,916 --> 01:42:55,333
Dad

1339
01:42:55,833 --> 01:42:56,041
1080

1340
01:42:56,041 --> 01:42:56,416
Dad

1341
01:42:56,916 --> 01:42:57,666
Dad

1342
01:42:58,166 --> 01:43:00,041

1343
01:43:00,541 --> 01:43:03,416
I can even run.

1344
01:43:03,916 --> 01:43:05,541
All thanks to doctor Sanjay

1345
01:43:06,041 --> 01:43:08,958
He's given me a new life.

1346
01:43:09,458 --> 01:43:10,916
Are you annoyed with me?

1347
01:43:11,416 --> 01:43:12,500
Because I didn't give you this news.

1348
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,375
No, princess, I got all the news of this palace.

1349
01:43:15,875 --> 01:43:17,416
Each and every news.

1350
01:43:17,916 --> 01:43:19,416
What news did you get?

1351
01:43:19,916 --> 01:43:22,916
That you're all right now and can walk around.

1352
01:43:23,416 --> 01:43:26,583
Apa, give Dr. Sanjay whatever he wants.

1353
01:43:27,083 --> 01:43:29,125
So that he may know that you are a very good person.

1354
01:43:29,625 --> 01:43:32,750
Send him to meet me.

1355
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:35,208
Papa

1356
01:43:35,708 --> 01:43:39,416
Geeta where are you

1357
01:43:39,916 --> 01:43:43,416
Geeta, I'm very happy today.

1358
01:43:43,916 --> 01:43:47,416
Give me that dress which is the most beautiful..

1359
01:43:47,916 --> 01:43:48,958
The best of them all

1360
01:43:49,458 --> 01:43:53,125
Don me with jewelry. Dress me the best.

1361
01:43:53,625 --> 01:43:55,958
The day that I desired for long has come.

1362
01:43:56,458 --> 01:44:01,416
The day that I yearned for long has come.

1363
01:44:01,916 --> 01:44:07,041
Dress me just like a bride waiting for her wedding.

1364
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:11,041
I heard that you called for me.

1365
01:44:18,208 --> 01:44:20,416
Yes. I did.

1366
01:44:20,916 --> 01:44:23,416
The princess is all right now.

1367
01:44:23,916 --> 01:44:25,791
I had met the princess just now

1368
01:44:26,291 --> 01:44:29,833
She wants me give you a big reward.

1369
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:32,583
You too want the same?

1370
01:44:33,083 --> 01:44:36,583
Here's your reward.

1371
01:44:38,916 --> 01:44:42,416
Your highness, I didn't do it for money.

1372
01:44:42,916 --> 01:44:45,416
Then for what did you do?

1373
01:44:45,916 --> 01:44:50,666
I had called you for treatment. But unfortunately.. ou maligned the relationship of a doctor and a patient.

1374
01:44:51,166 --> 01:44:53,291
Isn't doctor a human?

1375
01:44:53,791 --> 01:44:55,833
Doesn't he have the right to love?

1376
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:58,416
But you forgot your position.

1377
01:44:58,916 --> 01:45:00,750
You took advantage of our good behavior.

1378
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:03,958
You have defiled my prestige.

1379
01:45:04,458 --> 01:45:06,416
Before doing this you should have thought.

1380
01:45:06,916 --> 01:45:08,916
That we are royal blood.

1381
01:45:09,416 --> 01:45:11,083
And you're an ordinary man

1382
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:14,000
Yes, I'm an ordinary man.

1383
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,000
And I'm proud of that.

1384
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:19,166
Love doesn't care about the lows and highs of the society

1385
01:45:19,666 --> 01:45:25,708
That's the reason why the princess became all right..not by any medicine but by my love.

1386
01:45:26,208 --> 01:45:28,583
If your love was a medicine for her

1387
01:45:29,083 --> 01:45:31,583
then here is it's price

1388
01:45:32,083 --> 01:45:35,416
Your highness,

1389
01:45:35,916 --> 01:45:39,000
money can't buy everything.

1390
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,750
I don't want to discuss with you about.. What money can buy and what it can't.

1391
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:44,416
Better leave this palace at once.

1392
01:45:44,916 --> 01:45:46,625
Or else you'll not be treated well.

1393
01:45:47,125 --> 01:45:49,708
Your highness. Whom have you treated well?

1394
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:51,958
You didn't even let your children go free.

1395
01:45:52,458 --> 01:45:54,416
Not only elder princess was ill here.

1396
01:45:54,916 --> 01:45:56,500
But everyone was ill in this house.

1397
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,708
And you were the reason for their illness.

1398
01:45:59,208 --> 01:45:59,250
Only you.

1399
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:01,416
Whatever goes on in this palace is our personal matter.

1400
01:46:01,916 --> 01:46:02,333
I don't want to hear anything.

1401
01:46:02,833 --> 01:46:03,416
You must hear me!

1402
01:46:03,916 --> 01:46:06,416
You're that person who wants to snatch away.. the shine of the eyes.

1403
01:46:06,916 --> 01:46:08,791
You want to snatch away their sense" their intellect, their feelings.

1404
01:46:09,291 --> 01:46:12,083
You want to snatch everything that makes a human being.

1405
01:46:12,583 --> 01:46:15,833
Don't bother, your highness. I'll go from here.

1406
01:46:16,333 --> 01:46:17,416
But remember one thing.

1407
01:46:17,916 --> 01:46:22,541
You can't eliminate my love for the princess.

1408
01:46:23,041 --> 01:46:26,541
No power in the world can eliminate that.

1409
01:46:32,791 --> 01:46:33,750
Geeta, be fast.

1410
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:36,416
Quick!

1411
01:46:36,916 --> 01:46:39,291
Mr.Sanjay Has come.

1412
01:46:39,791 --> 01:46:42,958
You?

1413
01:46:43,458 --> 01:46:46,416
Princess, I want to say something to you.

1414
01:46:46,916 --> 01:46:50,500
You know that I was always worried about your health.

1415
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,416
I always wanted you to get well soon.

1416
01:46:54,916 --> 01:46:58,583
Papa, your blessings have made me all right.

1417
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:03,958
And you even know that I love you the most.

1418
01:47:04,458 --> 01:47:05,708
I know it.

1419
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:09,416
And I'll do everything for your good.

1420
01:47:09,916 --> 01:47:13,416
Dr. Sanjay told me that he loves you.

1421
01:47:18,166 --> 01:47:21,666
Do you..

1422
01:47:22,708 --> 01:47:25,625
He said he wants to marry you.

1423
01:47:26,125 --> 01:47:28,541
Do you want to marry him too?

1424
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:30,416
Yes, papa.

1425
01:47:30,916 --> 01:47:33,416
But only with your blessings.

1426
01:47:33,916 --> 01:47:37,708
Princess, I've removed Dr.Sanjay from this palace.

1427
01:47:38,208 --> 01:47:40,250
But.. why?

1428
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:42,125
I had called him for your leg's treatment.

1429
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:43,708
And not to marry you.

1430
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:45,666
He insulted my prestige.

1431
01:47:46,166 --> 01:47:48,375
He tried to ruin our family name.

1432
01:47:48,875 --> 01:47:52,166
But papa, he has done a great favor for us.

1433
01:47:52,666 --> 01:47:55,041
You can't repay favors with our prestige.

1434
01:47:55,541 --> 01:47:59,416
But you can at least be decent.

1435
01:47:59,916 --> 01:48:01,416
Then what do you want?

1436
01:48:01,916 --> 01:48:05,625
You want me to marry you to an ordinary man?

1437
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:10,291
You want our family name to be ruined?

1438
01:48:10,791 --> 01:48:13,416
You want our prestige to end with our kingdom?

1439
01:48:13,916 --> 01:48:15,291
If you want this

1440
01:48:15,791 --> 01:48:16,666
then you can have it your way.

1441
01:48:17,166 --> 01:48:18,958
I won't force you.

1442
01:48:19,458 --> 01:48:22,125
No. No, papa.

1443
01:48:22,625 --> 01:48:26,416
I don't want happiness at your cost.

1444
01:48:26,916 --> 01:48:32,500
I won't go from here without your blessings.

1445
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:39,208
I care about your prestige and reputation more than my life.

1446
01:48:39,708 --> 01:48:41,500
I had expected this from you.

1447
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,500
I was certain that just like me, my daughter too.. would give more prominence to her duty.

1448
01:49:18,875 --> 01:49:24,166
'Please take me close to you.'

1449
01:49:24,666 --> 01:49:29,375
'l'm lost in grief.'

1450
01:49:29,875 --> 01:49:34,416
'Rescue me from this world full of grief.'

1451
01:49:34,916 --> 01:49:39,500
'l'm lost in grief.'

1452
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,500
'Please take me close to you.'

1453
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:08,416
'These sights don't give pleasure to my eyes.'

1454
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:18,958
'l had enough of these stranded supports.'

1455
01:50:19,458 --> 01:50:24,375
'Don't burden me anymore.'

1456
01:50:24,875 --> 01:50:29,500
'l'm lost in grief.'

1457
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,791
'Rescue me from this world full of grief.'

1458
01:50:35,291 --> 01:50:39,916
'l'm lost in grief.'

1459
01:50:40,416 --> 01:50:43,916
'Please take me close to you.'

1460
01:50:56,083 --> 01:51:01,125
'These world is indeed full of grief.'

1461
01:51:01,625 --> 01:51:06,250
'But don't lose heart.'

1462
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:11,541
'These world is indeed full of grief.'

1463
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:16,541
'But don't lose heart.'

1464
01:51:17,041 --> 01:51:21,833
'The banks of this grief are near.'

1465
01:51:22,333 --> 01:51:26,916
'Don't lose heart.'

1466
01:51:27,416 --> 01:51:30,916
'These world is indeed full of grief.'

1467
01:51:45,833 --> 01:51:55,500
'These cruelties have to bow down.'

1468
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:06,166
'These lows and highs Wall will fall one day.'

1469
01:52:06,666 --> 01:52:12,375
'O beloved, I make you swear on me.'

1470
01:52:12,875 --> 01:52:16,416
'Don't lose heart.'

1471
01:52:16,916 --> 01:52:22,583
'O beloved, I make you swear on me.'

1472
01:52:23,083 --> 01:52:26,750
'Don't lose heart.'

1473
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:34,500
'These world is indeed full of grief.'

1474
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:45,000
'When will these sorrowful times change?

1475
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:55,125
'When will these hardships come to an end.'

1476
01:52:55,625 --> 01:53:00,250
'Take me away from this world.'

1477
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:05,416
'l'm lost in grief.'

1478
01:53:05,916 --> 01:53:10,500
'Rescue me from this world full of grief.'

'These world is indeed full of grief.'

1481
01:53:21,583 --> 01:53:25,791
'But don't lose heart.'

1482
01:53:26,291 --> 01:53:31,083
'The banks of this grief are near.'

1483
01:53:31,583 --> 01:53:36,166
'Don't lose heart.'

1484
01:53:36,666 --> 01:53:40,166
'These world is indeed full of grief.'

1485
01:53:48,208 --> 01:53:49,416
Did the elder princess have her breakfast?

1486
01:53:49,916 --> 01:53:53,416
Sir, the elder princess refused to eat breakfast.

1487
01:53:57,791 --> 01:54:05,416
It's her big misconception that she can put pressure on me.. to accept what she wants.

1488
01:54:05,916 --> 01:54:07,291
Excuse me your highness.

1489
01:54:07,791 --> 01:54:08,958
Yes

1490
01:54:09,458 --> 01:54:12,291
Sister has not eaten anything since yesterday.

1491
01:54:12,791 --> 01:54:15,125
Her health will be at loss if she doesn't eat anything.

1492
01:54:15,625 --> 01:54:18,041
And she will not be able to live.

1493
01:54:18,541 --> 01:54:22,375
You want to say that I should marry her off to a doctor!

1494
01:54:22,875 --> 01:54:25,125
I don't care if she die

1495
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:25,958
Yes

1496
01:54:26,458 --> 01:54:27,958
Your highness, I'm not hungry.

1497
01:54:28,458 --> 01:54:30,833
I understand your misbehavior very well. Sit down!

1498
01:54:31,333 --> 01:54:31,750
But why?

1499
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:33,416
You want to know why?

1500
01:54:33,916 --> 01:54:37,416
I only know to give orders and not answers.

1501
01:54:37,916 --> 01:54:39,125
Wrong.

1502
01:54:39,625 --> 01:54:40,416
What wrong?

1503
01:54:40,916 --> 01:54:42,708
The Indian government had questioned you that..

1504
01:54:43,208 --> 01:54:46,333
why shouldn't this kingdom be annexed with other parts.

1505
01:54:46,833 --> 01:54:48,416
But I didn't answer them.

1506
01:54:48,916 --> 01:54:50,083
And the monarchy was abolished.

1507
01:54:50,583 --> 01:54:54,083
But you still didn't ask for an explanation from them.

1508
01:54:57,916 --> 01:55:00,416
You can leave the table.

1509
01:55:00,916 --> 01:55:04,416
Your highness, baby is ignorant.

1510
01:55:04,916 --> 01:55:05,916
I ask for your forgiveness on her behalf.

1511
01:55:06,416 --> 01:55:10,208
Who are you interfere in between?

1512
01:55:10,708 --> 01:55:11,333
I am sorry yours highness

1513
01:55:11,833 --> 01:55:13,375
Sit down!

1514
01:55:13,875 --> 01:55:17,375
Your highness, I had enough!

1515
01:55:19,458 --> 01:55:20,375
You can go from here.

1516
01:55:20,875 --> 01:55:24,375
But remember this. You can never enter this palace again.

1517
01:55:24,875 --> 01:55:27,833
If I didn't care about sister"

1518
01:55:28,333 --> 01:55:29,250
I am sorry your highness.

1519
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:33,583
I am sorry your highness.

1520
01:55:34,083 --> 01:55:37,583
You can sit down.

1521
01:55:41,458 --> 01:55:44,958
Your highness

1522
01:55:52,916 --> 01:55:55,500
Please have a seat.

1523
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,416
What is the matter?

1524
01:55:58,916 --> 01:56:01,416
We have brought a plea for you?

1525
01:56:01,916 --> 01:56:03,875
I have no relation with pleas now.

1526
01:56:04,375 --> 01:56:07,041
You can make the new government listen to them.

1527
01:56:07,541 --> 01:56:11,750
It's age of democracy, now they'll listen to your pleas.

1528
01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:13,916
Sir, you're our government.

1529
01:56:14,416 --> 01:56:15,791
You've to give us justice.

1530
01:56:16,291 --> 01:56:19,375
This is question of our prestige. What do you want?

1531
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:22,083
The state government is preparing to election

1532
01:56:22,583 --> 01:56:24,416
Low class and lowly people are contesting the elections"

1533
01:56:24,916 --> 01:56:28,416
from your kingdom. Isn't this a shameful thing for us?

1534
01:56:28,916 --> 01:56:30,916
I can't do anything about it. This is democracy.

1535
01:56:31,416 --> 01:56:32,666
Anyone can become your leader.

1536
01:56:33,166 --> 01:56:34,833
Then be it a.. Well, forget it.

1537
01:56:35,333 --> 01:56:37,708
Will an ostler's son become our leader?

1538
01:56:38,208 --> 01:56:40,041
We can never tolerate this.

1539
01:56:40,541 --> 01:56:42,666
We've have been getting our bread.. And butter from you since ages.

1540
01:56:43,166 --> 01:56:48,166
Such low class people.. "Can never be allowed to rule over us!

1541
01:56:48,666 --> 01:56:52,083
Now, you'll have to tolerate a lot of things.

1542
01:56:52,583 --> 01:56:56,541
Thakur Maan Singh, why don't you contest the elections?

1543
01:56:57,041 --> 01:56:58,625
Sir, this is not possible.

1544
01:56:59,125 --> 01:57:01,791
How can we do this when you are there?

1545
01:57:02,291 --> 01:57:05,833
You're everything to us. So you'll become our leader.

1546
01:57:06,333 --> 01:57:07,583
This is shameful!

1547
01:57:08,083 --> 01:57:10,416
You want me to contest against a lowly ostler?

1548
01:57:10,916 --> 01:57:13,041
Actually we want to let the government know..

1549
01:57:13,541 --> 01:57:17,041
that you are really faithful.

1550
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:24,958
Come in Come in

1551
01:57:25,458 --> 01:57:27,625
Oh Randhir, please have seat.

1552
01:57:28,125 --> 01:57:30,125
Have seat.

1553
01:57:30,625 --> 01:57:35,708
I liked the place that you suggested for my dispensary.

1554
01:57:36,208 --> 01:57:39,708
I've given rent for four months.

1555
01:57:41,916 --> 01:57:43,500
What's the matter?

1556
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,916
Doctor, do you know ho's contesting" the elections against me?

1557
01:57:47,416 --> 01:57:49,250
Who is it?

1558
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:51,125
Is highness.

1559
01:57:51,625 --> 01:57:52,833
This is very happy news.

1560
01:57:53,333 --> 01:57:55,625
It'll be a close contest.

1561
01:57:56,125 --> 01:57:58,958
The king on one side and the subjects on the other side.

1562
01:57:59,458 --> 01:58:03,333
Doctor, I was thinking about withdrawing my name.

1563
01:58:03,833 --> 01:58:06,208
Is it because you are contesting against king?

1564
01:58:06,708 --> 01:58:08,250
You got scared so soon?

1565
01:58:08,750 --> 01:58:10,416
Randhir, you should be ashamed of yourself.

1566
01:58:10,916 --> 01:58:12,333
Doctor, I don't fear of no one.

1567
01:58:12,833 --> 01:58:14,125
But you don't know the people around here.

1568
01:58:14,625 --> 01:58:18,041
They considered kings as their God and they do it still today.

1569
01:58:18,541 --> 01:58:19,416
Look at my father.

1570
01:58:19,916 --> 01:58:22,583
Monarchy has come to end. But still, he's the same.

1571
01:58:23,083 --> 01:58:25,416
Even today, he doesn't like seeing me.

1572
01:58:25,916 --> 01:58:27,416
In this sistution i think that

1573
01:58:27,916 --> 01:58:28,333
Then do one thing

1574
01:58:28,833 --> 01:58:29,625
What?

1575
01:58:30,125 --> 01:58:34,416
Go to the palace at once and fall at his highness's feet. And beg for your forgiveness.

1576
01:58:34,916 --> 01:58:35,416
Your father will happy.

1577
01:58:35,916 --> 01:58:36,791
This won't be happen

1578
01:58:37,291 --> 01:58:41,125
I want to say that his highness has a lot of property.. lot of wealth and treasures.

1579
01:58:41,625 --> 01:58:43,875
And all the wealthy people of this city are on his side.

1580
01:58:44,375 --> 01:58:48,708
His money can make propaganda. He can buy votes. What can't he do with his money!

1581
01:58:49,208 --> 01:58:51,416
If money decides the future of our country.

1582
01:58:51,916 --> 01:58:55,416
Then remember. Democracy will never find its roots.

1583
01:58:55,916 --> 01:58:57,875
I agree that money can buy votes.

1584
01:58:58,375 --> 01:58:59,083
But remember

1585
01:58:59,583 --> 01:59:02,166
But don't consider that everyone.. Has a self-esteem so weak.

1586
01:59:02,666 --> 01:59:07,500
There are some people who are not greedy for money.

1587
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,750
Randhir, I can guarantee you two votes.

1588
01:59:12,250 --> 01:59:15,750
Princess Asha and myself.

1589
01:59:18,125 --> 01:59:22,500
Sister Sister, where are you?

1590
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,041
Sister, why are you so gloomy?

1591
01:59:26,541 --> 01:59:28,416
Sister, this world survives on hope.

1592
01:59:28,916 --> 01:59:30,916
Baby, don't bother me.

1593
01:59:31,416 --> 01:59:32,375
Sister, I can understand you.

1594
01:59:32,875 --> 01:59:36,375
So I've brought something " " which will make you get rid off all your troubles.

1595
01:59:36,875 --> 01:59:40,708
My troubles will end only with me.

1596
01:59:41,208 --> 01:59:42,708
But just see what I've brought.

1597
01:59:43,208 --> 01:59:45,208
Sanjay's letter.

1598
01:59:45,708 --> 01:59:48,416
Here. I had to face many troubles!

1599
01:59:48,916 --> 01:59:50,166
I jumped over the wall.

1600
01:59:50,666 --> 01:59:53,416
And when I came back I saw his highness before me.

1601
01:59:53,916 --> 01:59:55,375
A chill ran down my spine!

1602
01:59:55,875 --> 01:59:57,875
This is not a palace. But a jail.

1603
01:59:58,375 --> 01:59:59,500
Everything is guarded over here.

1604
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,416
Sister, why aren't you reading it?

1605
02:00:01,916 --> 02:00:03,375
Read it.

1606
02:00:03,875 --> 02:00:04,333
Not need it now

1607
02:00:04,833 --> 02:00:06,416
Sister what are you doing this?

1608
02:00:06,916 --> 02:00:09,208
Can you forget Sanjay by tearing this?

1609
02:00:09,708 --> 02:00:10,958
Don't read if you don't want to.

1610
02:00:11,458 --> 02:00:12,375
But you must listen.

1611
02:00:12,875 --> 02:00:16,375
Bring it here.

1612
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:18,416
I'll read it.

1613
02:00:18,916 --> 02:00:20,291
Your highness, this is sister's letter.

1614
02:00:20,791 --> 02:00:21,416
And reading other's letters..

1615
02:00:21,916 --> 02:00:23,208
is against good manners.

1616
02:00:23,708 --> 02:00:27,833
But, it's good manners to secretly" "bring a man's love letter in this palace!

1617
02:00:28,333 --> 02:00:30,416
It's good manners to ruin the family name.

1618
02:00:30,916 --> 02:00:31,291
No

1619
02:00:31,791 --> 02:00:36,791
It's good manners to humiliate.. and remove the person from the palace" who gave a new life to your daughter.

1620
02:00:37,291 --> 02:00:38,333
It's shameful!

1621
02:00:38,833 --> 02:00:40,500
Today, you made me to hit you!

1622
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,625
Your highness, don't regret this deed.

1623
02:00:43,125 --> 02:00:45,416
Perhaps, hitting someone too is a good manner for you.

1624
02:00:45,916 --> 02:00:46,500
Uncultured fool!

1625
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,416
You are talking too much nowadays.

1626
02:00:48,916 --> 02:00:49,750
But I know to control you very well.

1627
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:51,291
Look over here!

1628
02:00:51,791 --> 02:00:54,416
I even know who's instigating this revolt in you.

1629
02:00:54,916 --> 02:00:58,708
It'll not be good for you if you meet that ostler's son again?

1630
02:00:59,208 --> 02:01:01,416
This is my order that you shouldn't go out from this palace without my permission.

1631
02:01:01,916 --> 02:01:03,166
Forgive me your highness.

1632
02:01:03,666 --> 02:01:04,500
But I won't follow your this orders.

1633
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,375
Baby, be quiet. Don't talk in this way.

1634
02:01:08,875 --> 02:01:09,833
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1635
02:01:10,333 --> 02:01:11,541
Afterall he is our father.

1636
02:01:12,041 --> 02:01:16,166
Since childhood, I never felt him to be a father.

1637
02:01:16,666 --> 02:01:21,416
He always thought family name, prestige" "good manners and pride to be his life.

1638
02:01:21,916 --> 02:01:26,375
Who can't tolerate his children's happiness who wants to ruin his children's happiness?

1639
02:01:26,875 --> 02:01:28,208
How can we call that person as our father

1640
02:01:28,708 --> 02:01:31,416
He never had the time to give us fatherly love..

1641
02:01:31,916 --> 02:01:32,625
And neither did he ever try.

1642
02:01:33,125 --> 02:01:34,500
Baby, keep quiet.

1643
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,916
Sister, this is not the time to remain quiet.

1644
02:01:37,416 --> 02:01:39,708
He is never concerned about a human's value.

1645
02:01:40,208 --> 02:01:43,750
He judges a human being not his good values but by his breed.

1646
02:01:44,250 --> 02:01:45,791
That's why he removed Sanjay from here..

1647
02:01:46,291 --> 02:01:47,833
And ruined your happiness.

1648
02:01:48,333 --> 02:01:51,708
Instead of seeing you happy he wants you to remain on this chair as a disabled.

1649
02:01:52,208 --> 02:01:54,416
And he wants me to be with a king

1650
02:01:54,916 --> 02:01:57,833
Even though he knows.. that he's fool and a good for nothing person.

1651
02:01:58,333 --> 02:01:59,625
I'll never allow this to happen.

1652
02:02:00,125 --> 02:02:02,416
I've decided to marry Randhir.

1653
02:02:02,916 --> 02:02:05,083
Let me see, who will stop me.

1654
02:02:05,583 --> 02:02:06,750
Baby

1655
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:08,250
No. No, papa.

1656
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:10,333
No. No, papa.

1657
02:02:10,833 --> 02:02:13,416
If you move one more step then.. Sister, don't stop him.

1658
02:02:13,916 --> 02:02:14,750
Your highness

1659
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:21,416
shoot me so that the whole world knows that a father killed his daughter" for his selfishness and false pride.

1660
02:02:21,916 --> 02:02:23,541
No! It's better if a child like you dies.

1661
02:02:24,041 --> 02:02:24,875
Your highness!

1662
02:02:25,375 --> 02:02:27,583
You've to shoot me before shooting her.

1663
02:02:28,083 --> 02:02:29,375
Raj. Yes your highness.

1664
02:02:29,875 --> 02:02:31,416
Throw both of them out of this palace.

1665
02:02:31,916 --> 02:02:33,625
Your highness, I can't do this.

1666
02:02:34,125 --> 02:02:34,791
What did you say?

1667
02:02:35,291 --> 02:02:36,291
You can't do this!

1668
02:02:36,791 --> 02:02:38,250
So even you forgot your duty.

1669
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:40,416
Your highness, you are responsible for this.

1670
02:02:40,916 --> 02:02:43,291
We always did everything posslble to keep you happy.

1671
02:02:43,791 --> 02:02:46,083
We sacrificed all our happiness and desires.

1672
02:02:46,583 --> 02:02:48,916
We bowed before your stubbornness and obstinacy.

1673
02:02:49,416 --> 02:02:50,333
But you were never happy.

1674
02:02:50,833 --> 02:02:53,291
He won't be happy even if anyone dies for him.

1675
02:02:53,791 --> 02:02:55,208
We were unfortunate not to receive motherly love.

1676
02:02:55,708 --> 02:02:57,541
We thought that you'd never let us feel that want.

1677
02:02:58,041 --> 02:02:59,708
But you never gave us even fatherly love.

1678
02:03:00,208 --> 02:03:03,708
We were orphans even though we had a father.

1679
02:03:06,416 --> 02:03:09,125
Get out! All of you get out from here. I don't want to see your faces again.

1680
02:03:09,625 --> 02:03:13,041
We want the same, your highness. Baby, let's go.

1681
02:03:13,541 --> 02:03:18,125
Papa, please stop them.

1682
02:03:18,625 --> 02:03:21,416
This palace will become lonely if they go away papa.

1683
02:03:21,916 --> 02:03:24,500
So, you want to go with them, too? - No.

1684
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:25,708
No papa

1685
02:03:26,208 --> 02:03:29,708
I'll stay here.

1686
02:03:34,750 --> 02:03:38,250
I'll suffocate to death in these four walls.

1687
02:03:47,875 --> 02:03:49,625
It's a surprise! Why are you sitting here?

1688
02:03:50,125 --> 02:03:50,666
You should have gone inside.

1689
02:03:51,166 --> 02:03:52,166
Without your permission

1690
02:03:52,666 --> 02:03:55,416
This is no your palace but Sanjay's house.

1691
02:03:55,916 --> 02:03:57,416
So tell me today's latest news.

1692
02:03:57,916 --> 02:04:01,791
The princes and the princess" have been thrown out of the palace.

1693
02:04:02,291 --> 02:04:02,958
And you moved

1694
02:04:03,458 --> 02:04:04,416
Yes

1695
02:04:04,916 --> 02:04:05,583
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

1696
02:04:06,083 --> 02:04:07,416
Why?

1697
02:04:07,916 --> 02:04:09,833
You left your sister alone there.

1698
02:04:10,333 --> 02:04:15,166
Sister doesn't want to leave the palace" without the permission of his highness.

1699
02:04:15,666 --> 02:04:19,166
And she'll never get that.

1700
02:04:20,916 --> 02:04:23,625
The tall walls of the palace

1701
02:04:24,125 --> 02:04:26,083
the suffocation over there.

1702
02:04:26,583 --> 02:04:28,958
The silence over there.

1703
02:04:29,458 --> 02:04:32,958
May not once again the thought of suicide.

1704
02:04:39,916 --> 02:04:47,083
'Death maybe cruel.'

1705
02:04:47,583 --> 02:04:54,416
'But is more compassionate from life.'

1706
02:04:54,916 --> 02:05:01,916
'Death maybe cruel.'

1707
02:05:02,416 --> 02:05:05,916
'But is more compassionate from life.'

1708
02:05:26,875 --> 02:05:33,750
'Life gives always only grief.'

1709
02:05:34,250 --> 02:05:40,958
'Life ruins every happiness.'

1710
02:05:41,458 --> 02:05:48,375
'Death frees us from every burden.'

1711
02:05:48,875 --> 02:05:55,500
'Life is life's own enemy.'

1712
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,500
'Death gives some relief to the one who takes refuge in it.'

1713
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:17,291
'Death maybe cruel.'

1714
02:06:17,791 --> 02:06:21,291
'But is more compassionate from life.'

1715
02:06:41,666 --> 02:06:48,500
'Death may give nothing.'

1716
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:55,708
'But at least it get rids off life.'

1717
02:06:56,208 --> 02:07:03,083
'A smile may not come on the face.

1718
02:07:03,583 --> 02:07:10,375
'But tears do come in abundance.'

1719
02:07:10,875 --> 02:07:17,416
'If I'm not there, then who'll bear this grief?'

1720
02:07:17,916 --> 02:07:24,583
'Every saga of grief will end.'

1721
02:07:25,083 --> 02:07:31,958
'Death maybe cruel.'

1722
02:07:32,458 --> 02:07:35,958
'But is more compassionate from life.'

1723
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:50,500
Hema

1724
02:07:58,583 --> 02:08:00,750
Sanjay, why have you come here?

1725
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:02,125
I had to come here.

1726
02:08:02,625 --> 02:08:04,375
Sanjay, for God's sake, go from here.

1727
02:08:04,875 --> 02:08:08,416
If his highness sees you then it'll bring fresh trouble.

1728
02:08:08,916 --> 02:08:10,666
I'm not scared of his highness.

1729
02:08:11,166 --> 02:08:14,291
I'm scared of you.

1730
02:08:14,791 --> 02:08:15,958
Hema, you don't know the efforts..

1731
02:08:16,458 --> 02:08:19,750
I Made to remove the obstacles in your path.

1732
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:21,541
I had broken the shackles and chains.

1733
02:08:22,041 --> 02:08:24,416
With which you had bound to yourself.

1734
02:08:24,916 --> 02:08:27,416
And now you are going in the same world again?

1735
02:08:27,916 --> 02:08:30,500
You've started thinking of death again.

1736
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,208
Sanjay

1737
02:08:33,708 --> 02:08:39,625
Hema, not only you, but even I've a right over your life.

1738
02:08:40,125 --> 02:08:41,958
I love you.

1739
02:08:42,458 --> 02:08:44,291
Whenever I see my future..

1740
02:08:44,791 --> 02:08:47,416
Whenever I look at my days ahead..

1741
02:08:47,916 --> 02:08:49,666
Then I always see you with me.

1742
02:08:50,166 --> 02:08:52,666
That day is not far when we are going to unite.

1743
02:08:53,166 --> 02:08:54,541
You must wait for that day.

1744
02:08:55,041 --> 02:08:57,041
Sanjay, forget these things.

1745
02:08:57,541 --> 02:09:01,750
Some people are not destined to receive happiness.

1746
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:03,541
You are not one among them.

1747
02:09:04,041 --> 02:09:05,375
You've crossed that phase..

1748
02:09:05,875 --> 02:09:07,666
Where despair always hinders your life.

1749
02:09:08,166 --> 02:09:11,625
Hema, promise me that you'll never lose heart.

1750
02:09:12,125 --> 02:09:13,500
You'll never despise life.

1751
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,083
Sanjay, I beg of you.

1752
02:09:16,583 --> 02:09:18,291
Please for God's sake go way from here.

1753
02:09:18,791 --> 02:09:19,000
His highness

1754
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:21,208
His highness can take my life

1755
02:09:21,708 --> 02:09:23,583
I've come here ready to face any danger.

1756
02:09:24,083 --> 02:09:27,791
And I won't go till you answer me.

1757
02:09:28,291 --> 02:09:30,000
Hema, tell me that you'll wait for me.

1758
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:32,416
You'll never lose hope in life.

1759
02:09:32,916 --> 02:09:35,500
Tell me that you'll never be worried and unhappy.

1760
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,416
Promise me, Hema.

1761
02:09:37,916 --> 02:09:41,416
Promise me

1762
02:09:44,458 --> 02:09:49,166
Ok, Sanjay. I promise you.

1763
02:09:49,666 --> 02:09:53,166
But Sanjay, go from here.

1764
02:10:01,250 --> 02:10:02,125
Please forgive us, sir.

1765
02:10:02,625 --> 02:10:03,583
But our position is not very good.

1766
02:10:04,083 --> 02:10:05,708
But how did this happen?

1767
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:07,416
Now, what shall I say?

1768
02:10:07,916 --> 02:10:09,500
Nowadays it's such beggafs day.

1769

That Randhir is being talked about everywhere.

1770
02:10:12,916 --> 02:10:15,375
He has captivated the minds of the young.

1771
02:10:15,875 --> 02:10:17,416
His propaganda is gomg great guns.

1772
02:10:17,916 --> 02:10:19,125
And what are you doing?

1773
02:10:19,625 --> 02:10:23,041
Why don't you take all the goons of the city on our side?

1774
02:10:23,541 --> 02:10:25,625
Give them money required for their expenses.

1775
02:10:26,125 --> 02:10:28,833

1784
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:26,541

Thank you

1836
02:14:56,916 --> 02:14:59,333
This can't happen.

1837
02:14:59,833 --> 02:15:02,375
This means my subjects are not by my side.

1838
02:15:02,875 --> 02:15:03,625
It's really shameful!

1839
02:15:04,125 --> 02:15:07,416
You all could not stop" that coachman's son from winning against me.

1840
02:15:07,916 --> 02:15:08,916
Don't worry, sir.

1841
02:15:09,416 --> 02:15:13,041
Our enemies Randhir and Sanjay will be finished by tomorrow morning.

1842
02:15:13,541 --> 02:15:14,416
Yes sir

1843
02:15:14,916 --> 02:15:17,666
You've promised such things many times before.

1844
02:15:18,166 --> 02:15:19,833
You all fulfill your promises

1845
02:15:20,333 --> 02:15:23,958
so that your highness" "comes to know that you really care him.

1846
02:15:24,458 --> 02:15:25,416
Your highness

1847
02:15:25,916 --> 02:15:28,833
It's not easy nowadays. To take someone's life so easily.

1848
02:15:29,333 --> 02:15:33,625
Dr. Sanjay, my palace is only open for my faithful subjects.

1849
02:15:34,125 --> 02:15:34,833
And not for my enemies.

1850
02:15:35,333 --> 02:15:37,416
Your highness, that's what I've come to tell you.

1851
02:15:37,916 --> 02:15:40,416
That you can't judge between your enemies and friends.

1852
02:15:40,916 --> 02:15:42,416
Whom you consider your frindes Silence!

1853
02:15:42,916 --> 02:15:46,375
Your are the person who taught my children to rebel against me.

1854
02:15:46,875 --> 02:15:48,750
You made Randhir contest against me in the elections

1855
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:50,958
And ruined my prestige.

1856
02:15:51,458 --> 02:15:54,541
Your friends have ruined your presuge.

1857
02:15:55,041 --> 02:15:57,375
Your friends tried to buy votes.

1858
02:15:57,875 --> 02:15:59,416
They thrashed the people who refused to give votes, burned their houses.

1859
02:15:59,916 --> 02:16:02,291
They conspired to kill Randhir and me.

1860
02:16:02,791 --> 02:16:06,333
Your highness, your friends did all the cruelties" and atrocities possible in your name.

1861
02:16:06,833 --> 02:16:07,416
This is wrong!

1862
02:16:07,916 --> 02:16:09,000
I didn't give any such orders.

1863
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:10,500
These are your followers.

1864
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,250
You are responsible for their good and bad deeds.

1865
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:15,416
Your highness, the world has changed.

1866
02:16:15,916 --> 02:16:19,208
You can win the world with your love. But you can't with atrocities.

1867
02:16:19,708 --> 02:16:21,333
That's why your children couldn't understand you..

1868
02:16:21,833 --> 02:16:23,875
And neither did you ever try to understand your children.

1869
02:16:24,375 --> 02:16:26,708
I don't want your advice.

1870
02:16:27,208 --> 02:16:30,708
You all can leave now.

1871
02:16:36,416 --> 02:16:37,833
Didn't you hear what I said?

1872
02:16:38,333 --> 02:16:39,208
What do you want?

1873
02:16:39,708 --> 02:16:40,500
I want to meet Hema.

1874
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
You uncultured man!

1875
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:45,416
I know that you've been meeting princess secretly.

1876
02:16:45,916 --> 02:16:48,166
I could have shot you then and there.

1877
02:16:48,666 --> 02:16:49,958
But the thought of princess stopped me.

1878
02:16:50,458 --> 02:16:54,416
If you really think about princess" Then you would never have had confined her this way.

1879
02:16:54,916 --> 02:16:58,416
Your highness, you know that my love cured her.

1880
02:16:58,916 --> 02:17:01,833
And she can never be happy far from my love.

1881
02:17:02,333 --> 02:17:05,208
This sacrifice of princess will turn out to be a death for her.

1882
02:17:05,708 --> 02:17:07,416
I'll never tolerate this.

1883
02:17:07,916 --> 02:17:08,541
Dr. Sanjay

1884
02:17:09,041 --> 02:17:11,666
I'll never be sorry if I shoot you.

1885
02:17:12,166 --> 02:17:15,416
If you move one step further then..

1886
02:17:15,916 --> 02:17:19,416
Your highness, I know that you'll not shoot me.

1887
02:17:26,916 --> 02:17:29,416
Papa, what did you do?

1888
02:17:29,916 --> 02:17:31,083
Princess

1889
02:17:31,583 --> 02:17:35,208
I just want to show that I can fire at my enemies.

1890
02:17:35,708 --> 02:17:38,416
Tell Dr. Sanjay not to force me and leave this place at once.

1891
02:17:38,916 --> 02:17:40,416
Your highness

1892
02:17:40,916 --> 02:17:42,416
Your highness, he'll certainly go.

1893
02:17:42,916 --> 02:17:44,375
But he won't go alone today.

1894
02:17:44,875 --> 02:17:45,416
I'll go with him too.

1895
02:17:45,916 --> 02:17:48,041
Princess, what did you just say?!

1896
02:17:48,541 --> 02:17:49,666
I'm not a princess.

1897
02:17:50,166 --> 02:17:51,541
I'm not related to you anymore.

1898
02:17:52,041 --> 02:17:54,125
I used to consider you a good man.

1899
02:17:54,625 --> 02:17:58,333
I used to think that you're stubborn. You don't listen to anyone for your obstinacy.

1900
02:17:58,833 --> 02:18:03,166
But today I came to know that your obstinacy " " can even kill someone.

1901
02:18:03,666 --> 02:18:07,500
Princess, you know that I love you the most.

1902
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,708
I too used to love you.

1903
02:18:10,208 --> 02:18:12,083
So I followed your every order.

1904
02:18:12,583 --> 02:18:14,416
I didn't even support my brothers and sister.

1905
02:18:14,916 --> 02:18:18,041
And I even sacrificed my love for your sake.

1906
02:18:18,541 --> 02:18:19,958
But you've done a big mistake.

1907
02:18:20,458 --> 02:18:21,916
If this was the thing, then why didn't go before?

1908
02:18:22,416 --> 02:18:23,250
Because your highness,

1909
02:18:23,750 --> 02:18:25,791
I had promised mother that I'd take care of you.

1910
02:18:26,291 --> 02:18:27,500
And you had even promised me..

1911
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,083
That you wouldn't leave without my blessings.

1912
02:18:30,583 --> 02:18:32,791
You were not that person whom I had promised.

1913
02:18:33,291 --> 02:18:40,416
You think only about yourself. You don't think about anyone.

1914
02:18:40,916 --> 02:18:44,541
Sanjay, let's go.

1915
02:18:45,041 --> 02:18:47,875
Princess

1916
02:18:48,375 --> 02:18:50,750
you can't break your promise.

1917
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:56,416
Till today, no one in our family broke his or her promises.

1918
02:18:56,916 --> 02:18:59,833
I want you to fulfill that promise.

1919
02:19:00,333 --> 02:19:03,833
So I'm giving you my blessings.

1920
02:19:08,625 --> 02:19:12,125
You can go.

1921
02:19:34,916 --> 02:19:35,750
Your highness

1922
02:19:36,250 --> 02:19:39,791
Yes doctor

1923
02:19:40,291 --> 02:19:42,416
All the arrangements have been made.

1924
02:19:42,916 --> 02:19:48,416
The Bank of India has been asked to transfer your account.

1925
02:19:48,916 --> 02:19:52,541
These are your chequebook and passport.

1926
02:19:53,041 --> 02:19:54,416
Do you need anything else?

1927
02:19:54,916 --> 02:19:57,416
Send a telegram to Mother of Damgad.

1928
02:19:57,916 --> 02:19:57,916
Yes

1929
02:19:58,416 --> 02:19:59,958
Stating that we don't agree to their proposal.

1930
02:20:00,458 --> 02:20:01,166
Yes sir.

1931
02:20:01,666 --> 02:20:04,500
Let the allowance given to the prince and princess by the state

1932
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,000

Has be continue

1934
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:09,333
Yes your highness

1935
02:20:09,833 --> 02:20:13,625
Ask them that they can live in this house in my absence.

1936
02:20:14,125 --> 02:20:16,041
Yes sir

1937
02:20:16,541 --> 02:20:17,416
Yes sir

1938
02:20:17,916 --> 02:20:18,625
That's all

1939
02:20:19,125 --> 02:20:20,541
The car is ready sir

1940
02:20:21,041 --> 02:20:24,541
You Get ready.

1941
02:20:41,708 --> 02:20:43,208
What do you want now?

1942
02:20:43,708 --> 02:20:47,041
We want to say something to you, your highness.

1943
02:20:47,541 --> 02:20:50,750
I don't have time.

1944
02:20:51,250 --> 02:20:53,500
Don't leave us and go?

1945
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,708
There's nothing left for me here.

1946
02:20:56,208 --> 02:20:57,666
My land doesn't belong to me anymore.

1947
02:20:58,166 --> 02:21:01,916
My subjects didn't stand my side. Even my children don't love me.

1948
02:21:02,416 --> 02:21:05,875
No, your highness. You don't love us.

1949
02:21:06,375 --> 02:21:09,791
It's unfortunate that you never understood me.

1950
02:21:10,291 --> 02:21:13,708
I've always done what has been going on in our family for generations.

1951
02:21:14,208 --> 02:21:18,333
But you considered that as my obstinacy and my selfishness.

1952
02:21:18,833 --> 02:21:19,875
A father is never the enemy of his children.

1953
02:21:20,375 --> 02:21:23,333
I've done what I felt it was good for you.

1954
02:21:23,833 --> 02:21:25,375
The atmosphere that I was brought in..

1955
02:21:25,875 --> 02:21:28,333
There we respected our elder's advice as an order.

1956
02:21:28,833 --> 02:21:32,416
Even I considered my father's every word as an order and followed them.

1957
02:21:32,916 --> 02:21:34,583
This is the tradition of our family.

1958
02:21:35,083 --> 02:21:38,416
I've have not done a mistake by expecting this from you.

1959
02:21:38,916 --> 02:21:41,333
Everything changes as time passes by.

1960
02:21:41,833 --> 02:21:43,416
Why are you comparing the past and the present?

1961
02:21:43,916 --> 02:21:47,125
But how I can forget our traditions our customs and family values.

1962
02:21:47,625 --> 02:21:52,416
But your highness, why are you involving traditions "Customs and family values with our love?

1963
02:21:52,916 --> 02:21:57,208
Because of your royal pride we had to always call you his highness.

Your highness, there is nothing difficult in this world.

1969
02:22:16,916 --> 02:22:19,208
It was difficult for you to give away this kingdom.

1970
02:22:19,708 --> 02:22:21,875
But you sacrificed your kingdom for the country.

1989
02:23:20,833 --> 02:23:21,416

Your highness, I want to tell something.

1998
02:23:42,291 --> 02:23:44,416
I too have my love in my kingdom.

1999
02:23:44,916 --> 02:23:45,416
But she's poor.

2000
02:23:45,916 --> 02:23:51,000
And for that reason I being a king couldn't marry her.

2001
02:23:51,500 --> 02:23:54,375
But princess has cleared my way.

2002
02:23:54,875 --> 02:23:57,416
