1
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:26,426
Govindam! Our Kasthuri has
delivered a son.

2
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,999
What a great news, mother!

3
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:30,864
The third time she has been
blessed by God with son.

4
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:35,167
You check the almanac and
come to see your son, bye.

5
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay mother.

6
00:01:36,176 --> 00:01:39,304
Madam! Are you Kasthuri's relative?

7
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:44,041
Yes, she's my daughter-in-law.
- Her child is dead.

8
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:48,780
What are you saying?
- Yes, the child died unable to breath.

9
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:54,819
Oh God!

10
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,124
Third delivery...

11
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:59,755
...if my daughter-in-law knows
the truth, she'll lose balance.

12
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:02,493
Calm down madam,
the dead never come back.

13
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:06,696
But if you agree, l've an idea.

14
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:10,434
Just now another lady
delivered twins both male.

15
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:16,212
l think she's very poor, if you take
a child without her knowledge,

16
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,681
her difficulties will ease and
your daughter-in-law will also be happy.

17
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:20,478
What do you say?

18
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:27,116
When God takes away something,
he gives something.

19
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:31,754
We'll consider the child
as God's blessings.

20
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:54,713
Did you see the nose?
Exactly like my father's.

21
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:56,116
lsn't it, mother?

22
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:59,118
Why are you shaking head differently?

23
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,453
By any chance are you saying no?

24
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:03,721
What's that nonsense?
He's exact replica of grandpa.

25
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:07,924
That's it! Look, how he's smiling
like the temple bells.

26
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:13,103
Sorry lndira! l don't know how it
happened in one night?

27
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:19,372
l think God felt l can't raise
two children and took away one.

28
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,603
Bye.

29
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:53,812
According to horoscope,
his name should start with 'N'.

30
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,379
My father's name is Narasimhacharyulu.

31
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:58,416
So his name is Brindavanam
Narasimhacharyulu, write son.

32
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:05,151
Madam, according to his horoscope,
name with letter 'N' will be good for him.

33
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,452
Then, name him after
Lord Lakshminarasimhasawmy.

34
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,959
Okay madam...Narasimha!

35
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,928
My dear Narasimha!

36
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,761
Charlu! What are you looking up there?

37
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,336
Why are you looking at hen?

38
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,840
l don't know why, grandma.
l feel like eating it on seeing.

39
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:29,209
Hen?
- Hen? Bloody! l'll rap on your head.

40
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:32,011
Did you see mother?
What nasty wishes?

41
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:34,619
l think he'll bring bad name
to our family.

42
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:37,780
Keep quiet, he's just a kid.
What does he know?

43
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,153
From today, l'll raise him
like a pure Brahmin.

44
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:43,626
Like a Brahmin?
lsn't he a Brahmin then?

45
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:46,129
Why are you hanging down your head?
- Keep quiet.

46
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:49,234
Let's arrange his thread ceremony,
bad thoughts will vanish on it's own.

47
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:50,996
Arrange it first.

48
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:59,107
God bless you!

49
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:05,112
Hail Lord Ganesh!

50
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:42,284
lf you trouble me or my fried again,
you'll be dead.

51
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:21,458
l went to sleep at 4 am and
l got your phone call at 6 am.

52
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:24,256
Look at the black circles around eyes.
- Yes sir.

53
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:27,556
How many? - 4 sir.
- All are Rasool gang members.

54
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:31,568
These 4 bodies perpetrated
many crimes when alive.

55
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:33,705
They were responsible for
half of the city's crimes.

56
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:38,037
Whether it's recent rape case in metro
train or murder of Kondapuram brothers,

57
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,542
there's no crime without
their hand in it.

58
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:42,180
Whether our time is good
or their time was bad,

59
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:43,940
they have become dead bodies.

60
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:46,612
ls it good or want to go
for another take?- Good sir.

61
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,584
Why did you show me
more fat last time on TV?

62
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:52,587
please take little care.
Show some interest.

63
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:55,117
Greetings Naik sir.
What brings you here sir?

64
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:56,626
This comes under my area.

65
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,559
Though it's your area,
those goons are from my area.

66
00:06:58,732 --> 00:06:59,357
l couldn't avoid it.

67
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:02,161
lf you Anti-Goonda squad
take over all cases,

68
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,927
what can we local police do then?

69
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:07,505
Then, tell your men to get hot coffees.

70
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:11,006
lf we get the coffees,
will you take over the cases?

71
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:16,044
Look at him! How confusing he's
who will take over the case?

72
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:17,740
He has been like that since morning.

73
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:21,751
But l don't like you ordering me
to get coffees.

74
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:24,617
You come sir,
he'll not listen to anyone.

75
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:26,792
Correct, that's why l'm also
known as Mental Naik.

76
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,451
Not about you sir, it's about the media.

77
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:31,587
Where are the TV9 people?

78
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:41,798
Have you seen the
container that blew up?

79
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:45,035
lt blew up last night.
- lt was the staring point of the trouble.

80
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,611
Ratnam! You know how he killed him?

81
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:44,347
please leave me.

82
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:48,925
Okay, l'll leave one and you leave one.
- What?

83
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:51,586
l'll leave the bullet, you leave the life.

84
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:57,201
Was he killed last, sir?
- Yes, he was the last victim.

85
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,271
He has put dots perfectly
on foreheads.

86
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,000
How come he's predicting
like Nostradamus?

87
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:04,040
He's coming sir.

88
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,043
Why did he kill them sir?
- We'll know the details.

89
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:09,238
police should've imagination too
along with investigation.

90
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:10,609
Sir, that is...

91
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:14,453
How does he know everything?
l mean about that case...

92
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,458
please sit down.

93
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:24,254
Tell me Anand sir,
how is your real estate business?

94
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,897
Very dull sir.

95
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,261
Bookings have come down
and calls are on raise.

96
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:29,162
What calls sir?

97
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:33,829
Gangs! lf anyone makes money,
they call up for protection money.

98
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,100
Did you get any such call...?
- No sir, no calls like that.

99
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:42,543
ls it you who thought about me?

100
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:46,378
ls it you who called me?

101
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,310
Tell me in which film this song comes?

102
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:50,854
Mayabazaar, right sir?
- You were right.

103
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:52,285
Tell me in which film this comes?

104
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,291
Bloody creep!
This is my last phone call.

105
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:59,090
Rs.2 crores, tomorrow night
my men will wait for you.

106
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:02,359
Even if it's one rupee short,
not one in your family will survive.

107
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:03,331
l'll pay sir, don't harm my family.

108
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:05,061
Tell me in which film
his dialogue comes?

109
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:07,433
Do you know?
-l don't know sir.

110
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:11,705
Ratnam, tell our men to
do theirjob silently.

111
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:14,813
What can we do?
We've to do to get the truth.

112
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:18,677
Sir, l paid Rasool after he
threatened my family.

113
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:20,809
You gave him okay,
but whom did you send after them?

114
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,887
Sir, l didn't send anyone.
- True?- True sir.

115
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:27,220
Tell me what actually had happened?
- l went there sir.

116
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:37,762
l gave them cash and returned.

117
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:40,134
Was there only one man
when you gave the cash?

118
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,797
One man only sir.
- Nobody else?- Nobody else sir.

119
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:46,673
Ratnam, after he left the place,
what had happened there was...

120
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:48,905
ls it smelling good?

121
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:50,841
Who are you?

122
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:03,858
Salman, l'll take care of him,
you go with the bag.

123
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:05,429
Go and tell Bhai.

124
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:19,804
That's the story; he killed them
and took away the cash.

125
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:22,437
Though we may let him go,
Rasool will not leave him.

126
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:24,708
He'll think he has arranged to kill them.

127
00:13:24,884 --> 00:13:26,852
What should l do now, sir?
- Where is Rasool?

128
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:29,284
He's in Bangkok.
He called me from there only.

129
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:32,356
When he comes here,
you go to Bangkok. Go!

130
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,288
Rs.2 crores!
What will he do with so much money?

131
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,451
He'll throw away!
Why should we bother about it?

132
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,410
Add little love...

133
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:27,546
Add little fire...

134
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:29,647
push a little...

135
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:33,951
Add little sweet...

136
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,087
Add little bitter...

137
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:38,883
Add a little smile...

138
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:43,092
Listen to me once more...

139
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:51,327
Listen to my philosophy...

140
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:53,529
Every minute is our friend...

141
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:57,369
Drown yourself in the river of fun...
life is intoxicating wine...

142
00:14:57,543 --> 00:15:01,946
Hail Lord Shiva!

143
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:55,991
One is intoxicated by women...

144
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:58,035
Another is intoxicated by God...

145
00:15:58,237 --> 00:16:01,798
Entire world is languishes
in intoxication...

146
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:04,534
One is intoxicated
in stashing away...

147
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,610
Another is intoxicated
in stealing...

148
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,374
Salvation of Man is
in intoxication only...

149
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:12,847
lntoxication...unknown intoxication...

150
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,010
past, present and future
is another intoxication...

151
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:10,234
Man who lives for himself is the king...

152
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,010
Lives in bottles...

153
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,170
Tasty on opening...

154
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:19,114
lf you've patience,
pour yourself from it...

155
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:23,850
Youth is like ice, it melts away...

156
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:27,618
Take chances and use it quickly...

157
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:32,059
Fun...fun...its great fun
to be born as human...

158
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:36,430
lf heart and glass is full,
God comes after that...

159
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:30,616
Grandma!

160
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:35,492
Why did you shout now, Chari?
Did you see any snake?

161
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:37,788
l don't care if its snake,
it was a fish, grandma.

162
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:39,760
How come fishes are there
in a Brahmin's tank?

163
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:43,493
Why did you cry so loud?
- Not cries but fishes.

164
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:45,762
Entire Brahmin neighbourhood
has become impure, father.

165
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:49,897
Besides as priest, somebody is
growing fishes in the tank.

166
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:53,010
Who would do it here?
lt may have come by mistake.

167
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,113
Leave it.
- Would l catch without leaving it?

168
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:57,306
l left it long back.
But l'll not leave this matter.

169
00:18:57,516 --> 00:19:00,007
Chari, one or two fishes
is common in tanks.

170
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:01,653
Will they keep quiet?

171
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:03,516
ln few days it'll become hundreds.

172
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,316
Without anyone personally
putting it the tank?

173
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:06,684
How can it be in the tank?

174
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:09,555
l must know who did that.

175
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:14,358
Why entire community is here?

176
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,694
Nothing much,
when l was offering evening prayers,

177
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:18,131
a fish came into my hands.

178
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:19,566
l was about to gulp it.

179
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:22,832
Fish is irritating in hands
but very tasty in mouth.

180
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:23,975
Guru!

181
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:25,633
l had a fish for Asthma as medicine.

182
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:28,006
Would l eat every day?
Forget about this.

183
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,442
Getting late to the
auspicious time for film,

184
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:31,207
you come man,
they are film personalities,

185
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,215
if we go late, they'll finish
the program using dupes.

186
00:19:33,352 --> 00:19:34,546
lf we miss it,
we can fix another time,

187
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,245
why nobody is concerned about
traditions getting mauled?

188
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:39,651
Your son is becoming very orthodox.

189
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:42,259
Don't get angry. Mother...

190
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:46,256
Don't be so orthodox, if your Guru
is angry, he'll remove you.

191
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:47,262
My foot, grandma.

192
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:48,696
He just talks,
he can't chant any hymns,

193
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:49,926
without me, he's nothing.

194
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:51,933
Modern times need to be talkative,

195
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:54,095
we've taken Rs.1 lakh loan from him.

196
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:57,333
lf we don't listen to him,
he'll ask us to repay immediately.

197
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,104
Not one, let's pay 4 lakhs to him,
why should we be afraid of him?

198
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,577
pay him now.
- How can l suddenly pay him?

199
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:06,616
That's why, just do what he says
till we repay the loan.

200
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:08,082
Okay. What about the fishes?

201
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,779
l'll get men to catch it, you go now.

202
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:18,259
Get down.

203
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:22,263
Less sugar? What's this lousy title?

204
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:24,426
Remake film bought
after paying heavily.

205
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:27,629
Our Amitabh Bachchan's film
'Cheeni Kum' in Hindi

206
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:29,774
Why are you saying 'our'?
ls he our uncle?

207
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:35,005
He's also a Brahmin, we are from
Hyderabad and he's from Allahabad.

208
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:37,715
You've given me great energy.

209
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:40,716
l don't know much about Bollywood,
so l don't know much details.

210
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:43,112
Are we dominating there also?

211
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:45,886
lt's giving me good kick.
Come.

212
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:48,458
Why are you so late, priest?
Hero is coming.

213
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:50,720
Want us to come early or
come for the auspicious time?

214
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,420
Where's the producer?
l've to settle about payment.

215
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:55,122
Vasant sir is the producer,
director and hero,

216
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:56,199
except the heroine.

217
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:58,929
Why isn't he doing that
role too, bloody creep?

218
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:12,042
Long live roaring star!

219
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:14,412
He's like a patient, and they are
calling him roaring star!

220
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,713
Chari, stop passing these comments.

221
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:18,618
You too must stop it.

222
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:28,256
Hello sir...hello man...
break coconut offering prayers.

223
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:30,265
Film will be a super duper hit.

224
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:33,296
Great offering.

225
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:36,499
We offered special prayers
for your film to be a hit,

226
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:38,040
if you pay our fee,
we'll take leave now.

227
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,804
Guru is waiting outside,
a body is waiting in cremation ground.

228
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,278
Come today evening,
madam will pay you.

229
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:46,941
Should we come back for the money
evening for morning prayers?

230
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,020
lmpossible.
- You want deluxe flat or Santro car?

231
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,487
No chance of getting the fee here,
will you present her a Santro car?

232
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:54,750
What's this trouble in the middle?

233
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:57,020
Not middle, this film started
with our prayers,

234
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:59,960
did you hear this? Not only he has
less sugar, less money too.

235
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:03,101
He used our service for prayers
and not paying us.

236
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:04,701
What's this, manager?

237
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,701
l told him madam will pay,
but he's not listening.

238
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:10,501
Madam is near the pool,
go and ask her.

239
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:12,734
Madam?
What is he to the madam?

240
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:14,606
Grandpa.
- What? Grandpa?

241
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,888
Where is this silly girl?

242
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:29,293
Oh God! Less sugar there
and less clothes here.

243
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:40,771
A girl is drowning, why are you
all watching fun, you creeps?

244
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:46,109
What's this?
Why do you want to die?

245
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:48,439
Committing suicide is sin,
you know that?

246
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:50,873
Wait....wait...
- What are you doing?

247
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:55,043
Mouth to mouth resuscitation,
haven't you seen it in films?

248
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,710
Who asked you to fish me out?

249
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:59,119
No need of anyone's order
to do good thing.

250
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,225
l saw you in danger,
l jumped in to save you.

251
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:03,293
Why are you scolding me
instead of saying thanks?

252
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:07,422
lt's all because of you,
l lost the bet.

253
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:10,535
Will your dad pay it?
- Bet? l swear l wasn't aware of it.

254
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:14,069
l saw bubbles in water...
you will be angry on me.

255
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:17,606
Because there's a mole on
the left side of your waist.

256
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,472
Not only that, you'll have twins.
- What?

257
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:21,977
Yes, mole astrology says that.

258
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:24,115
Not only that, come closer,
l'll tell you.

259
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:27,113
Shut up! Why are you here?

260
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:30,551
Roaring star sent me here to collect
fee from his grand daughter.

261
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:31,586
lf you pay, l'll take leave.

262
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,384
l'm not his grand daughter, she is.
- She?

263
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,554
Okay....okay...
You lost Rs.10000, so pay him.

264
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:41,093
Come.

265
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:46,128
You all are girls, isn't it sin to
have drinks in day time?

266
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:48,773
This is party culture, you shut up.

267
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:52,170
Take Rs.8000.
- What about the balance Rs.2000?

268
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:54,835
You saw my two moles, fee for it.

269
00:23:55,013 --> 00:23:57,208
Wouldn't you've given anything
had l told about all moles l saw?

270
00:23:58,584 --> 00:23:59,516
Go away!

271
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,209
Morning a fish and now a girl

272
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:04,446
Don't know how many hurdles
l may face today?

273
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,925
Used to work in Defense research lab,

274
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:20,367
Weapons designer,
l want details about him.

275
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:25,738
He died long back.
- l know, is his wife still alive?

276
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:30,780
Details about military men
is confidential, can't tell you.

277
00:24:31,683 --> 00:24:35,676
Rules are for people like you
not for criminals like us.

278
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:40,118
Your aged parents live
in 23rd sector of Chandigarh,

279
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:42,886
poor old people, what if anything
happens to them?

280
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:48,856
Learn to save your family too
along with this nation.

281
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:02,272
This was the last
communication address.

282
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:11,689
House is very beautiful,
by the way what do you do?

283
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,323
You've bought such a big bungalow.

284
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:15,824
Scrap...scrap business, mother.

285
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:18,724
l'm exporting up there
all the scrap from here.

286
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:24,460
ls it? Do it son.
Work hard day and night, earn more.

287
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:28,164
You must be happy always
without any difficulties.

288
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,432
Okay mother.

289
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:31,940
Look dad, she wants me
to work day and night.

290
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,135
You died in an accident,
l'll die in an encounter.

291
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:37,282
What are you saying, son?
- Nothing, look around the house.

292
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:43,846
Are all the doors closed?

293
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:47,116
You're speaking in 3 languages
like railway announcer.

294
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:48,122
Who are you?

295
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:50,887
l don't know which language
you speak, that's why.

296
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,429
Telugu, we are Telugu people, tell me.

297
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,497
My name is Nandu,

298
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:57,295
l'm studying final year Bsc
in near by Reddy College, aunty,

299
00:25:57,469 --> 00:26:00,734
few rogues were after me.
- Why are they after you?

300
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:05,535
Beauty...my beauty is my problem.

301
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:09,112
You're good looking, right?
- Good looking? l'm a dasher.

302
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:10,213
That's why they are after me.

303
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:13,146
lf you go around in such clothes,
anyone would feel like that only.

304
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:14,376
What to do?

305
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:17,488
lf we wear long skirt or churidhar,
they say we belong to olden times,

306
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:20,090
if l wear modern dresses,
rogues are after me.

307
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:23,023
ls he your son, aunt?
- Yes.

308
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:25,254
Do you stay here only?
- Yes. Why?

309
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,331
Nothing, l never saw you
coming after me.

310
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,525
There's no man who hasn't
come after me, aunt.

311
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:34,901
My son isn't like that.
- l can see it.

312
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:40,375
My energy is down after running around,
can you offer me a health drink, aunt?

313
00:26:40,545 --> 00:26:41,739
l'll get it.

314
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:46,115
House is very good, new one?

315
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:47,507
What's this? Mother may come.

316
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:50,985
Afraid of mother but not me, right?

317
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:54,751
That's why l'm here,
you haven't met me for 4 days.

318
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:57,521
l'll come everyday.
- Will you?

319
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:05,002
l was teaching her self defense
techniques to avoid oglers.

320
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,105
Got it? You just follow it.
- Thanks aunty.

321
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,002
please ask your son to
drop me at home, aunty.

322
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:11,107
Who? Me?

323
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:13,767
Drop her son.
- Come.- Come.

324
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:21,943
How great it would be
if my second son too was alive?

325
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:33,028
What's this Guru?
How can l be your friend?

326
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:33,960
lt's strange.

327
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:36,794
What's strange in it?
Friendship has no age bar.

328
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:38,937
Did you call me urgently to tell this?

329
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:44,098
No, l've hidden something from you.
- Don't say you're not a Brahmin.

330
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:47,109
l got doubt when you discussed
about Halim with Salim in old city.

331
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,009
Stop your silly doubts.

332
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:55,609
l want to ask you a thing.- What?
- Have you ever fallen in love?

333
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:58,746
Love? Me?
Can we also fall in love?

334
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:00,584
Why not?

335
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:04,889
lf you take history, Salim-Anarkali,
Romeo-Juliet, Laila-Majnu,

336
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:08,726
it's always them only,
there no evidence of us in love.

337
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:11,597
History is nothing,
you can tear it away.

338
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:13,534
But love isn't like that.

339
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:16,435
You're going on talking about love,
by any chance you...

340
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,905
Are you feeling shy?

341
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,679
Feeling shy too with this face.

342
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:27,216
Stop feeling shy and
tell me who is that girl.

343
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,911
Rajahmundry Ganapathy Shastri...
- He's no more.

344
00:28:30,122 --> 00:28:32,488
He died in last pushkar festival.

345
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:36,388
l dated his eldest daughter Sasikala
while offering his obsequies.

346
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:37,585
While chanting hymns?

347
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:40,788
Mouth was chanting,
but eyes were free.

348
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:43,433
l tried but my bad luck.

349
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:46,264
Before l could express my love,
she got married.

350
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:50,636
ln that marriage l saw his second
daughter Lakshmikala, average girl,

351
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:53,437
l fixed her marriage with another man,

352
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:56,507
his third daughter Chandrakala is very...

353
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:59,047
lf you miss her too,
you'll be left with mother only.

354
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:00,548
l too have that tension.

355
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:03,620
That's why l shifted mother
and daughter to Sanathnagar.

356
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,417
l'll introduce you to Chandrakala,

357
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:09,151
you must tell her about me
which l can't tell myself.

358
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:11,090
Show me, l'll entangle with her.

359
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:15,131
please don't do that, like you
help me in conducting marriages,

360
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,768
just help my love, that's all.

361
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:22,434
House is very big, Guru.

362
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:25,201
You must also tell big about me.

363
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,837
Definitely...Guru!

364
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:31,544
Are you fine, aunty?

365
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:34,710
What can we lack in
when you're with us, Bhattu?

366
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:38,448
Bhattu?
- Aunt calls me fondly. Come in.

367
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,555
He's...?
- My cousin, my disciple too.

368
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:43,751
Greetings.
- Greetings.

369
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:46,523
You've come in hot sun,
l'll get you cool water.- Okay.

370
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,102
Guru, these furnishings...
- l sponsored it.

371
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:02,143
l think they have used you very well.

372
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:05,977
Let them use me, l'll be happy
if my love succeeds.

373
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:10,279
l think you've become very busy,
you seldom come here.

374
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:14,483
Then what? Jogging at 6,
to gym at 7, Yoga at 8,

375
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:16,149
Guru is trying for six pack body.

376
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:18,193
Enough of it.
- Keep quiet Guru.

377
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:20,888
lnfact l'm surprized
how you still remain a bachelor.

378
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:26,628
l must find the girl l like, right?
What do you say aunt?

379
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:30,165
What? My guru getting old?

380
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:34,870
lnfact when he was conducting a marriage,
bride was ready to elope with him,

381
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:35,980
why don't you tell her?

382
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:38,708
How can l say?
lt's routine in every marriage.

383
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:41,284
Aunt would've heard about it.
- No, l didn't.

384
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:42,483
May be people are not talking about it.

385
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:43,643
Don't stretch it anymore,
lest it may break.

386
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:44,811
l too feel the same.

387
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,890
Where is Chandu, aunt?

388
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:50,256
Just now went to change
after offering prayers.

389
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:55,532
lf you feel l'm saying too much,

390
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,066
Chandu is like sweet in skirt.

391
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,433
You're like bier in dhoti.
Will it match?

392
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:05,676
You...
- She's here.

393
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:10,281
Why does she comes every time?

394
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:13,875
She's coming.

395
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:25,419
Why isn't she lifting her head?

396
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:28,257
Shyness...l'll make her lift.

397
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:33,092
She...?
- What?

398
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:35,535
l need to talk to urgently.
Come out l say.

399
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:36,605
What's this nonsense?

400
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:39,073
please listen to me,
it's not nonsense.

401
00:31:40,912 --> 00:31:44,814
How many times l've told you
to call me as Bhattu?

402
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:47,975
Okay Bhattu.
Two-in-one you gave isn't working,

403
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:50,848
l'm finding it difficult to hear
'Suprabhatham' early morning.

404
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:52,980
lf you send him in,
l'll explain it to him.

405
00:31:53,124 --> 00:31:56,651
That's all? My boy is all-in-one.
He'll repair it in minutes. Go.

406
00:31:56,828 --> 00:31:59,524
l too want to tell you about
that two-in-one only.

407
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:01,928
First repair hers.

408
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:05,059
Why are you pushing me?

409
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,703
What's this boy?
- Boy?

410
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:08,338
Yes, boy!
- Yet again!

411
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:10,599
Will you tell the truth to your Guru?

412
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:15,235
Won't l? You've used my Guru to
buy TV's, fridge, VCR's, two-in-ones.

413
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:18,814
How can l keep quiet?
- Okay, tell him.

414
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:20,349
l'll also tell him.
- What?

415
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:26,821
Where you held me in the pool and
about searching moles on my body.

416
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:30,450
Come, let's tell him.
- You tell him, his heart will break.

417
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:33,996
lsn't it? Then let's keep shut.
- What?

418
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:36,600
Mouth.- Then open it.
- What?- Door.

419
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:40,795
ls the job done?
- lt wasn't ordinary, troubled me a lot.

420
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:43,440
Though it troubled you,
job is done, right?

421
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:45,735
Chandu, be ready,
we are going out evening.

422
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,934
Where to?

423
00:32:51,883 --> 00:32:55,114
l said no but you forced me to come.
l hate pubs.

424
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:59,018
Romance in public is thrilling.
Don't spoil the fun.

425
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:02,323
ls it necessary to go with tufts?

426
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:04,519
lt's free, would l come if we've to pay?

427
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:06,061
l conducted the opening
ceremony of this pub.

428
00:33:06,264 --> 00:33:08,164
What's this Bhattu,
l'm uncomfortable in this dress?

429
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,266
Yes, you hate clothes, right?

430
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:13,070
l'm embarrassed without dhoti.

431
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:16,763
What's this? Black dress code,
can't avoid it.

432
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:18,067
To hell with codes.

433
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:21,344
Why?
- For pub's ad.

434
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:34,292
Why are you settling down here?
Get me a beer.

435
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:35,050
What? Liquor?

436
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:38,993
Chari, you're strong in hymns
but weak in epics.

437
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:41,325
What Gods have?
- Heavenly drink!

438
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:44,900
Locals call it as arrack,
here it's beer. Get it now.

439
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,334
Whatever the name is,
the result is the same.

440
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:54,003
Hey you! Give me a beer.

441
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:56,178
Just now you took a beer.

442
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:58,872
What? Me? Beer?
When did you give me?

443
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:02,551
You silly fellow, don't kill me
with your butler English.

444
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:05,246
You may've mistaken in dark.

445
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,683
What's this nasty?
You're pinching my buttocks.

446
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:09,121
Who are you?

447
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:11,452
Why are you speaking like that?
- That's my style.

448
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:13,961
Give me a beer quickly,
girls are pinching buttocks here.

449
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:15,929
You're very irritated.

450
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:22,438
Hey...hey...why are you going
there when l'm here?

451
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,766
Why don't you talk to me?

452
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:27,237
Keep it.
Sit there.

453
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,115
Where are you going?
- Do l've to tell you?

454
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:35,913
Are you angry?
- No, tuft.

455
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,155
l think he's coming back to say sorry.

456
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,710
That one?
An old man took it from me.

457
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,780
l wanted to hit him but
left him respecting his age.

458
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:05,444
You give me a beer.

459
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:11,181
Take your beer.
- Give me little time.

460
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:12,947
Why are you disturbing me?

461
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:15,250
Who is he? Your uncle?

462
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,297
Trying to hold back laugh, right?

463
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:25,601
l thought he's your uncle.

464
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,269
Even enemy mustn't face
such situation.

465
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:30,873
Yes, please do something.

466
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:32,669
What do you think of yourself?

467
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:36,644
Though he appears like old man,
he's youth inside.

468
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:39,283
Like gray hair at young age,
he's old at young age.

469
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:48,323
Lousy!
You go, l'll manage myself.

470
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:52,587
Guru!
- Give us some privacy. Go.

471
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:56,529
Why are you staring at me?

472
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:59,602
Will you pinch me?
Come on pinch me!

473
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:02,802
Behave decently.
- Decency? Who is decent here?

474
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:05,442
l'm dying in this cigarette smoke,
l'm going out.

475
00:36:06,911 --> 00:36:10,438
lf l force him to come,
he'll show me hell.

476
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:12,609
What a figure, buddy!

477
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:15,546
l'm fixed!

478
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,119
Where did you go?

479
00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:20,320
Why are you so moody for
forcing you to come here?

480
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:21,617
l expected a lot from you.

481
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:23,624
You've brought me to a dirty place.

482
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:28,459
Shall we dance, Chandu?
- Dance? l don't know to dance.

483
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:32,399
Do l know to dance? Get on
the floor, you'll start dancing.

484
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,871
Bhattu, they are wantonly touching me.

485
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:43,878
Why are you disturbing us?

486
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:49,947
Chandu, let's go home.
- Why don't you say something?

487
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:53,284
What can l say when they hit me?
Come, let's go.

488
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:55,025
Move....move...

489
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,520
You go home.
- Why?

490
00:36:58,696 --> 00:36:59,993
Go...please...

491
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:02,098
Why suddenly?
- l said go.

492
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:08,370
lt's common to get hit in pubs.
You don't feel bad.

493
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:11,303
You wouldn't have got beaten
if l wasn't with you.

494
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:13,033
They would've died
if you weren't with me.

495
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:15,202
Killed them instantly.

496
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:22,777
Unnecessarily l brought her out.

497
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:24,421
Why are you leaving hurriedly?

498
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:26,388
l'll drop her at home.

499
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:29,059
Let's talk after that.
- No, let's talk now.

500
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:32,390
That's all! Come.
- Come.

501
00:37:33,298 --> 00:37:35,994
What's this nuisance?
- Nuisance?

502
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,759
Leave her with us and walk out.

503
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:42,305
You're young and have good future,

504
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,271
if you try any girl, you'll get them.

505
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:47,936
l got her after years and
moreover invested heavily on her.

506
00:38:20,812 --> 00:38:24,771
Guru! Where did he go away?
Guru!

507
00:38:51,142 --> 00:38:54,771
Guru! Where did he go away?

508
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,693
pay bill?

509
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:16,834
You made us conduct
opening ceremony for free,

510
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:18,195
now you want us to pay the bill.

511
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:22,271
Call the owner crook.
l'll take him to task. Call him.

512
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,714
priest, you go.
- How can l?

513
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:34,045
l was going but these
two fools stopped me.

514
00:39:34,218 --> 00:39:35,708
They tortured me till now.

515
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:37,946
Scold them before me,
only then l'll go.

516
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:39,953
ldiots! say sorry to him.

517
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:42,453
l'll thrash you, idiots!
- You carry on, priest.

518
00:39:54,572 --> 00:39:57,097
l think all the useless guys
are here only.

519
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:02,546
Why did you leave without me?

520
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:03,805
Were you really so angry?

521
00:40:03,981 --> 00:40:05,107
How can l not be angry on them?

522
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:07,877
l was so angry that l wanted to
tear them like Lord Narasimha...

523
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:10,748
You're fine, aren't you Chari?
- Nothing will happen to him.

524
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:14,449
l too have beaten up many goons
but never before a lady.

525
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,254
Must be careful when ladies
are around, let's go home.

526
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:20,323
They may come back.

527
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:23,990
Then, l'll come by auto,
you drop Chandu at her home.

528
00:40:24,168 --> 00:40:27,501
Me? Solo?
- Yes, you...solo...come.

529
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:31,468
Can't you say something
instead of driving silently?

530
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:33,133
l know only hymns, nothing else.

531
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:35,438
Then do onething,
praise me with your hymns.

532
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,104
praise you? What should l praise?

533
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:38,942

534
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:44,453
Hail your beautiful eyes...

535
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:50,585
Hail your pink sweet lips...

536
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:57,432
Hail your silken tresses...

00:40:57,602 --> 00:41:03,598
Hail your Kohinoor

00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:35,138
Hail your devastating beauty...

539
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:45,773
Hail your sheen that
makes me go sleepless...

540
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,817
My heart is boiling
with hot passions...

541
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:54,219
My youth is breaking into pieces...

542
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:57,122
Your structure is mind boggling...

543
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:45,136
Flower offering for your style...

544
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:48,278
prayers for your shine...

545
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:53,141
lncense sticks and
lamps for your glitter...

546
00:42:53,317 --> 00:42:56,115
Dedication for your walking gait...

547
00:42:58,723 --> 00:43:03,751
l'll bloom like flower at your
each step to kiss it...

548
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:09,867
l'll become your sari to
be with you always...

549
00:43:39,263 --> 00:43:46,192
Don't spread around your beauty
to incite young men...

550
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:53,600
Don't spread your charm to force me
to cross line of decency...

551
00:43:56,047 --> 00:44:01,144
My heart beat races fast
on seeing you...

552
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:07,451
Like fire crackers,
burst on me like a she-devil...

553
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:55,098
Maj. Chandrasekhar was my brother-in-law.

554
00:44:55,272 --> 00:44:59,106
After his death, his wife, my sister who
was pregnant then lived with me.

555
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:01,435
My wife didn't like her.

556
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:05,342
She insulted and sent her out of home.
l wasn't here then,

557
00:45:05,516 --> 00:45:08,883
later l frantically searched for her,
but no use,

558
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:11,781
a relative informed about
seeing her in Hyderabad,

559
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:15,447
l searched there also,
but still didn't find her.

560
00:45:21,265 --> 00:45:22,527
By the way, who are you?

561
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:35,742
l'm going to meet Calcutta Baba,
you comb every slum in Hyderabad.

562
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,610
Call me on finding her.
- Slums?

563
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:44,779
Yes, all destitutes go to slums only.
Go, search.

564
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:03,303
What's the price of brinjals?
- Rs.20 a kg.

565
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:05,806
What? Rs.20? My foot!

566
00:46:05,943 --> 00:46:07,843
l don't get that much even
if l chant hymns for an hour.

567
00:46:08,045 --> 00:46:09,910
lt won't grow in one hour,
it'll take six months.

568
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:12,811
Look at him, he's selling words
too with vegetables.

569
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,577
Lousy beetroot face!
- Leave him.

570
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:17,915
l will, you sit at home and eat.
pick brinjals quickly.

571
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:19,847
Take your money.

572
00:46:25,729 --> 00:46:27,128
The note has holes.

573
00:46:27,298 --> 00:46:30,392
When brinjals you sell has worms,
can't my note have holes?

574
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:31,432
Who the hell are you man?

575
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:34,469
Granny! What happened?
You were fine till now.

576
00:46:34,638 --> 00:46:36,697
l'm having chest pain.

577
00:46:36,874 --> 00:46:38,535
Not that side, let's go this side.

578
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:41,539
l told you many time not to
eat pickles and chutneys.

579
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,576
A month has passed
since l demanded money.

580
00:46:49,753 --> 00:46:51,550
Why are you putting off?

581
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:55,283
Your grand son...what's that school?

582
00:46:55,726 --> 00:46:58,524
lt seems you got him
admitted to Sloka School.

583
00:46:58,696 --> 00:47:03,190
Do you want him to study well
and come good in life or die?

584
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,733
Don't harm him,
l'll pay whatever your demand is.

585
00:47:05,903 --> 00:47:10,966
Now you speak like human,
in 1 hour my boys will be in city centre,

586
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:13,143
send Rs.1.5 crores with them.
- Okay...okay...l'm coming with money.

587
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:15,005
Brother!

588
00:47:15,212 --> 00:47:18,045
Go to city centre and
bring money from Seth.

589
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:19,273
Okay, brother.

590
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:22,784
Come...- Brother.
- Call Venkat.

591
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:25,550
Brother.

592
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:28,823
You also go to the city centre.

593
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:31,257
Watch the proceedings
from a distance.

594
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:34,295
Someone has killed 4 members
of Rasool's gang.

595
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:36,057
Let's be careful.

596
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:38,531
Keep an eye, be alert.

597
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:14,028
Tell me.
- Brother, safe. Got the cash.

598
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:16,070
Come to Vikarabad guest house.

599
00:48:19,977 --> 00:48:23,174
lt seems someone is targeting
gangs in the city,

600
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:27,215
it seems he killed Rasool's men
also while taking cash like this.

601
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:30,547
Are you scared?
- No way, why would l get scared?

602
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:32,882
l'm just giving you information.

603
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:39,660
l suspect we have company.

604
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,230
Mad man! lf he comes behind,
it doesn't mean company.

605
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:45,926
Why to take risk? Let's stop aside
and empty the bladders.

606
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,335
Should we piss in fear?
- ls pissing means fear?

607
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:52,998
We piss ten times a day,
are we doing it in fear?

608
00:48:58,015 --> 00:49:00,210
Your candidate has gone.

609
00:49:00,551 --> 00:49:01,540
Why are you scared?

610
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:05,155
Scared? How many people
we had killed till now?

611
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:06,618
Did l ever get scared?

612
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:11,090
You turn back and go after him,
l'll kill him for fun.

613
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:44,160
Who are you?
- Shahrukh Khan's cousin brother!

614
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:46,261
ls it necessary to know the details?

615
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:47,761
Where is the cash bag?

616
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:49,161
He has a gun!

617
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:53,632
You don't know about my boss pandu,
he'll kill you wherever you may hide.

618
00:49:53,804 --> 00:49:55,635
Keep quiet, why are you inciting him?

619
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:57,933
What bothers us if he kills or
not after we are dead?

620
00:49:58,075 --> 00:50:00,509
please leave me.

621
00:50:00,678 --> 00:50:03,442
My girl friend warned me
not to join these rogues.

622
00:50:03,614 --> 00:50:04,603
l didn't listen to her.

623
00:50:04,782 --> 00:50:07,046
please leave me, l'll go back
to my native place Bunder.

624
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:09,448
Are you scared of me or my gun?

625
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:13,886
l too handled guns,
l'm scared of you only.

626
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:14,956
You look like a torpedo.

627
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:17,151
You fool! Why are you begging
at his feet?

628
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:20,593
Bloody shut up!
Why are you shouting at me?

629
00:50:20,764 --> 00:50:22,925
Why are you staring at me?

630
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,660
Shall l tell him and get you killed?
Brother, first kill him.

631
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:28,532
please leave me,
l'll go back to Bunder.

632
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:38,104
Bloody! Holding a small gun
and moving it casually,

633
00:50:38,248 --> 00:50:39,442
will you stylishly point at us?

634
00:50:39,616 --> 00:50:40,947
Brother Seenu.

635
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:44,115
Sorry brother, forgive me
please don't mind me.

636
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:47,381
Watch now, l'll bite his neck to death.

637
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:53,428
Who do you think l am?
l've come from Bunder.

638
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:09,870
Would anyone expect you
to point a second gun?

639
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:11,378
please leave me, l beg you.

640
00:51:11,548 --> 00:51:15,575
You act very well,
where did you learn to act?

641
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:18,051
ln Bunder.
- What shall l do now?

642
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:22,283
What else?
Kill them, drop me in Bunder,

643
00:51:22,493 --> 00:51:24,757
you too can see Bunder.

644
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:35,227
Naik sir! Greetings!
Brother, we are safe.

645
00:51:35,406 --> 00:51:39,035
Naik sir, this mad man has
been threatening us, kill him.

646
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:42,475
Brother, tell him.
- Sir, he killed the gangs in city.

647
00:51:42,646 --> 00:51:44,841
He killed Rasool's gang, kill him.

648
00:51:45,015 --> 00:51:45,538
Why are you hesitating?
Kill him sir.

649
00:51:45,716 --> 00:51:49,550
He wishes very much, kill him.

650
00:51:50,454 --> 00:51:52,149
Don't kill me.

651
00:51:57,261 --> 00:52:00,856
Why so many twists?
You ordered and he killed them.

652
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:03,693
l'll tell you later
but first get the cash bag.

653
00:52:03,867 --> 00:52:05,198
Okay brother.

654
00:52:08,772 --> 00:52:11,707
Brother! - What?
- Have you spared me?

655
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:16,209
You couldn't know it because of fat,
you were shot long back.

656
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,951
How could you kill me so silently?

657
00:52:24,721 --> 00:52:28,782
This is yours and this is mine.
- l don't want.

658
00:52:29,026 --> 00:52:30,823
l'm not doing this for money.
l want my job.

659
00:52:30,994 --> 00:52:35,795
You're doing the same job what
an Sl does without joining police.

660
00:52:35,966 --> 00:52:36,591
What's the difference?

661
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:40,931
There is sir, l can't tell my mother
also what l'm doing now.

662
00:52:41,104 --> 00:52:44,699
lf l do the same thing in uniform,
everyone will talk about me.

663
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,070
l'm after you for two years now.

664
00:52:47,244 --> 00:52:50,077
Sl recruitment announcement
will be made in 3 months.

665
00:52:50,247 --> 00:52:51,714
Wait till then.

666
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:54,451
One more important thing.

667
00:52:59,256 --> 00:53:02,748
Why are you staring at him?
- You keep quiet daddy.

668
00:53:02,926 --> 00:53:05,087
You didn't come to my dance
program because of him, right?

669
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:09,255
l forgot about it. He's not in
any way connected to it.

670
00:53:09,466 --> 00:53:13,596
He came just now.
- Why are you still after the Sl's job?

671
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:16,261
lf you trust my dad,
can't even become a constable.

672
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:18,338
No girl will marry a police man.

673
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:20,272
Didn't your mother marry your father?

674
00:53:20,477 --> 00:53:22,001
Will anyone commit a mistake knowingly?

675
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:24,647
You mean am l waste?
- Did l say that?

676
00:53:24,815 --> 00:53:27,613
You both go in, we need to talk.

677
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:32,352
You said about an important matter.

678
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:35,117
Got information about Rasool
coming to the city.

679
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:38,693
You be careful.
- You must be careful sir.

680
00:53:38,862 --> 00:53:41,854
lf anything happens to me,
you'll be in trouble.

681
00:53:44,935 --> 00:53:46,766
Brother, Rasool is coming.

682
00:53:58,415 --> 00:54:00,975
pandu, l can understand your pain.

683
00:54:01,151 --> 00:54:05,952
Look, we asked for two,
he has sent four.

684
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:08,387
He asked one and half,
he has sent three.

685
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:13,394
l suspect he's killing mathematically.
What do you say?

686
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,997
You'll think l'm talking silly
but l'm serious.

687
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,602
The man who killed my men
has killed your men too.

688
00:54:22,773 --> 00:54:25,936
We both want him.
He must die in our hands.

689
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:28,669
Has anyone of your men seen the killer?

690
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:29,941
No.

691
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:34,611
He killed all the three people
including my brother.

692
00:54:34,785 --> 00:54:36,275
Who got the news?

693
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,884
He!

694
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:40,921
But he says he didn't see anyone.

695
00:54:41,091 --> 00:54:42,786
Didn't you suspect anyone?
- No, brother.

696
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,484
Mad man! Recollect the scene.

697
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:47,323
He'll not be far from us,
he'll be very near only.

698
00:54:47,464 --> 00:54:50,092
Recollect where our men were.

699
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:55,596
No brother.

700
00:54:57,207 --> 00:55:03,612
Try to remember, it'll be a lone man
very close to our people.

701
00:55:20,297 --> 00:55:22,595
Now l remember, brother!
A man followed our men,

702
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:24,996
when they went with cash,
he followed them.

703
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:27,500
l'm sure it's him.
- But you said you didn't see anyone.

704
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:31,333
pandu, stop...
l'll talk to him.

705
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:36,540
Can you recognize him?
- l can, his face is unforgettable.

706
00:55:36,747 --> 00:55:39,875
How does he look like?

707
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:46,952
Look, this is the last time,
don't accept funerals.

708
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:49,422
lt's stinking.
- Let's use incense sticks and manage.

709
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:50,890
Why manage instead of refusing?

710
00:55:51,028 --> 00:55:53,929
Once you accept priesthood,
you've to do everything.

711
00:55:54,097 --> 00:55:55,496
Not that Guru...
- You kid...

712
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:57,930
Old man!
- Come!

713
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:10,206
Elder brother you're still alive
l'm sad about your brother's death.

714
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,281
You mean?
- l didn't mean you must die.

715
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,214
Chari, start the rituals.

716
00:56:24,027 --> 00:56:27,554
Take rice and put into the
mouths of the bodies.

717
00:56:35,072 --> 00:56:39,168
Take the bodies and cremate them.
l mean cremate them.

718
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:41,537
Already over? Offered only rice.

719
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:45,273
Then offer full meals, bodies will eat.

720
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:48,446
Sir, if you pay us, we'll take leave.

721
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:51,115
Though he's a goon he pays well.

722
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:53,880
How dare you say a priest
has killed them!

723
00:56:54,057 --> 00:56:55,183
Why can't he do it?

724
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:58,725
We can't trust anyone in our business.
No doubt it's him.

725
00:56:58,895 --> 00:57:00,795
He covered the tuft with a cap.

726
00:57:00,964 --> 00:57:04,695
You don't get confused,
this is not a silly matter.

727
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:06,495
We shouldn't take chances
because he's just a priest.

728
00:57:06,703 --> 00:57:08,500
l'll confirm if he's that
same guy or not.

729
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:11,106
You can gun him down then.
You come with me.

730
00:57:18,582 --> 00:57:21,380
Your son...?
- My son is not an astrologer, but l am.

731
00:57:21,518 --> 00:57:22,712
Then your son?

732
00:57:22,886 --> 00:57:24,786
Concentrate on your horoscope.
- Tell me.

733
00:57:24,955 --> 00:57:26,286
One is weak and one strong.

734
00:57:26,456 --> 00:57:27,445
What is weak and what is strong?

735
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:29,058
Favourable signs are weak and
bad signs are strong.

736
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:31,091
You're running very bad time.

737
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:33,923
That will be worse.
- Long life or is there any break?

738
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:36,930
Around the same time next year...

739
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:39,167
...you'll be on streets.

740
00:57:39,336 --> 00:57:41,429
Father, take coffee.

741
00:57:41,905 --> 00:57:42,929
Who is he?
- Me?

742
00:57:43,106 --> 00:57:46,269
l mean, who is he?

743
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,348
He's too much.

744
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:59,546
Come and sit.
- Why are you in a hurry?

745
00:57:59,689 --> 00:58:01,554
l'll tell you good news, come.

746
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:04,660
Got hold of any billionaire client.

747
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:05,520
Billionaire?

748
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:07,926
Why are you leaving?
There's lot to tell.

749
00:58:08,098 --> 00:58:09,087
My foot!

750
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:11,291
Horoscope is checked
for good future only,

751
00:58:11,468 --> 00:58:13,868
not to lose interest in life
and become mendicant.

752
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:16,762
Aunty called me urgently.
- Why?

753
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:21,001
lt seems Chandu is eager
to marry after pub visit.

754
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:22,770
lt means poison has
turned into manna.

755
00:58:22,946 --> 00:58:23,810
Yes.
- Go fast.

756
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,108
Bhattu may die on knowing
l'm going to marry Chari.

757
00:58:27,284 --> 00:58:32,586
Let him die, useless man.
Will you spoil your life for him?

758
00:58:33,456 --> 00:58:34,787
l think he's here.

759
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:37,786
Come in Bhattu.
- Where is Chandu?

760
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:40,327
She's inside due to tension.

761
00:58:50,307 --> 00:58:53,538
Why is she feeling shy seeing me?

762
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:55,105
You go out.
- No...

763
00:58:55,278 --> 00:58:58,839
Let him stay here.
- No, l don't want anyone between us.

764
00:58:59,015 --> 00:59:02,212
You, me and aunty.
You go out.

765
00:59:04,754 --> 00:59:07,450
Both went in and he came out.

766
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:12,994
l never expected l'll ever fall in love.
But l've fallen in love.

767
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:17,463
l'm much tensed to tell you
about my love.

768
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:19,898
l'm also tensed to hear it.

769
00:59:22,472 --> 00:59:26,135
What's this feeling?

770
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:30,439
l feel like my heart is shivering.
- Old heart, it will shiver.

771
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:36,115
please encourage me.

772
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,315
He came and went in.
He's standing outside only.

773
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,151
What could've happened there?
- Shall l inquire them?

774
00:59:42,325 --> 00:59:44,589
Don't ask, observe them.

775
00:59:46,396 --> 00:59:50,332
Why are they following me
since morning? Bloody fools!

776
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,091
l think he's suspecting us,
he's coming here.

777
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:55,932
All of you be quiet, l'll manage him.

778
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:08,383
You always answer it on seeing me.

779
01:00:08,551 --> 01:00:10,212
And it rings only after you do it.
What's the matter?

780
01:00:10,387 --> 01:00:11,684
lt happens when you're tensed.

781
01:00:11,888 --> 01:00:13,446
Who is tensed? You or phone?

782
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:16,456
lf it has, it's mine too.
- Why are you following me?

783
01:00:16,626 --> 01:00:18,617
You started off from my home,
stopped here, what's the matter?

784
01:00:18,762 --> 01:00:22,664
We are not following you,
we are waiting for a purpose here.

785
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,893
You will know it.
- l said l want to know it now.

786
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:28,697
Chari, come here.
Don't talk to strangers.

787
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:32,103
He too is like your phone.
Coming Guru.- Come here.

788
01:00:32,275 --> 01:00:34,971
Why are you calling me?
- They want you inside.

789
01:00:35,145 --> 01:00:36,134
Me? Why?

790
01:00:36,313 --> 01:00:39,282
l think marriage can't be
fixed without you.

791
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:41,542
Everything is fine, right?

792
01:00:41,718 --> 01:00:44,710
Not fine, she says love and marriage,

793
01:00:44,854 --> 01:00:46,719
but not committing with me,

794
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:48,289
l'm also unable to ask her openly,

795
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:49,618
you come and deal.

796
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:52,990
Come.
Did your Guru tell you everything?

797
01:00:53,163 --> 01:00:55,529
He did.- Then, do you accept this
proposal of marriage?

798
01:00:55,699 --> 01:00:59,260
No need of his acceptance,
let's go head, aunty.

799
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:05,737
How could he come out so quickly?

800
01:01:08,611 --> 01:01:10,340
You went in just now,
how could you change so quickly?

801
01:01:10,513 --> 01:01:12,481
Move away. l need to go urgently.

802
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:14,742
First you clarify my doubt.

803
01:01:15,819 --> 01:01:16,945
ls it cleared?

804
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:20,486
What's this new confusion?

805
01:01:20,657 --> 01:01:24,024
He has changed the get up
and fooling us.

806
01:01:24,194 --> 01:01:25,821
Do you think another man is inside?

807
01:01:26,029 --> 01:01:27,826
Had uncle been alive
we wouldn't face any problem?

808
01:01:27,998 --> 01:01:30,023
Though he's not with us,
aren't you here for us?

809
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,601
You must conduct Chandu and
Chari's marriage.

810
01:01:35,972 --> 01:01:37,769
What are you saying?

811
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:44,605
She's right.
l understood it after long suspense.

812
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:49,782
l should've cut you when you talked
about entwining with her.

813
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:54,916
Guru, please listen to me.

814
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:59,858
Don't call me like that,
you kicked on my heart.

815
01:02:00,063 --> 01:02:01,325
No sir.

816
01:02:02,866 --> 01:02:05,801
ls he one or two?
- One man is acting as two.

817
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:10,770
please listen to me, Guru...
- l too cheated many but not like this.

818
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,602
Auto, come here!
- He's escaping, follow him.

819
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:24,046
A girl wants to marry only you
if not wants to commit suicide.

820
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,312
Tell him mother.

821
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:26,750
Marry her, boy. She'll be here.

822
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:29,324
What she'll be here?
We'll go to streets.

823
01:02:29,492 --> 01:02:33,223
They are not ordinary ladies,
they took everything by cheat from my Guru.

824
01:02:33,396 --> 01:02:36,832
This old lady Suryakantham
is very cunning.

825
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:40,833
Your Guru is no innocent man,
he too is a cheat.

826
01:02:43,406 --> 01:02:45,101
Why is coming with a gang?

827
01:02:45,275 --> 01:02:47,573
Granny, l can't avoid telling you this.

828
01:02:47,744 --> 01:02:51,145
My Guru loves Chandrakala.
- Oh my Bhattu!

829
01:02:51,314 --> 01:02:53,441
What are you saying?
- Truth!- Our Bhattacharya?

830
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:54,480
Yes granny, it's him.

831
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:57,984
Useless man!
With holy marks on forehead.

832
01:02:58,188 --> 01:02:59,621
Dirty rotten face!

833
01:03:00,957 --> 01:03:03,289
Come in Bhattu! We were
discussing about you only.

834
01:03:03,493 --> 01:03:07,930
l heard everything,
entire community has heard it.

835
01:03:08,098 --> 01:03:09,588
Shouldn't a pot bellied
man fall in love?

836
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:11,290
What is my profession? priest!

837
01:03:11,468 --> 01:03:14,494
l've to sit and work.
Won't l have a pot belly?

838
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:16,138
Are they having six pack body?

839
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:18,331
Can you guaranty that
he won't get a pot belly?

840
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:21,102
Discussion is about marriage not stomach.

841
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:24,877
please don't be so harsh, l feel hurt.

842
01:03:25,014 --> 01:03:27,278
Aren't you ashamed?
Do you want love?

843
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,941
What's wrong in it?
He took care of that family in troubles,

844
01:03:30,153 --> 01:03:31,711
he shared theirjoys and sorrows,

845
01:03:31,888 --> 01:03:37,258
is it wrong to think of marrying
the old woman to give her a life?

846
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:46,528
please don't feel shy,
l feel like killing myself.

847
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:49,570
Guru, you told me you love Chandrakala.

848
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:52,469
l told them the same indirectly.
They misunderstood me, fools!

849
01:03:52,642 --> 01:03:54,337
Did you not plan to marry the mother?

850
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:55,603
planned to marry the daughter?

851
01:03:56,112 --> 01:03:59,673
Dirty rogue! Women of this
neighbourhood will spit on your face.

852
01:03:59,849 --> 01:04:01,282
Let's go.
- Let's go.

853
01:04:01,451 --> 01:04:02,918
Why are you still here?
Get going.

854
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,316
l'll go if you repay
my loan of Rs.4 lakhs.

855
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:08,457
Rs.4 lakhs?
You said Rs.1 lakh only.

856
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,685
lt was when terms were good,
now added interest.

857
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:13,920
Why should they pay you?

858
01:04:14,063 --> 01:04:16,361
My son-in-law has been
your assistant for 4 years,

859
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:18,797
have you ever paid him a rupee?

860
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:20,766
Your loan is settled, go now.

861
01:04:20,937 --> 01:04:21,904
Son-in-law?

862
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:23,770
Already become relatives.

863
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,601
No Guru...
- Stop it.

864
01:04:26,242 --> 01:04:31,339
Got saved because l don't know hymns,
else l would've cursed you.

865
01:04:31,648 --> 01:04:34,617
l'll not leave this issue so easily.
- please listen to me, Guru...

866
01:04:36,819 --> 01:04:37,786
Be careful!

867
01:04:38,588 --> 01:04:40,385
When shall we fix the marriage, aunt?

868
01:04:40,557 --> 01:04:42,149
What for? For your obsequies?

869
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:45,192
What's that nonsense?
Your daughter is my daughter-in-law.

870
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:46,760
That's settled.

871
01:04:48,231 --> 01:04:50,961
Did you see? She winked at me
when you all are here.

872
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:53,701
Winking? What's that?

873
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:57,397
Bloody women! Father, they cheated
my Guru using such tricks.

874
01:04:57,574 --> 01:05:00,270
l've to find him now...Guru...

875
01:05:00,443 --> 01:05:03,708
ldiots! Who are you guys?
Has my Guru sent you?

876
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,348
Do you know how many times l saved
him because he doesn't know hymns?

877
01:05:06,516 --> 01:05:09,212
Leave me,
he has got no loyalty too.

878
01:05:09,385 --> 01:05:11,546
Guru! Are you also here?

879
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:14,650
Did you see his double action?

880
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:20,091
He was abusing me and
suddenly changed on seeing me.

881
01:05:20,296 --> 01:05:22,662
He's a crook!
Kill him sir!

882
01:05:22,832 --> 01:05:24,424
Why should they kill me?
- Shut up!

883
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:28,797
Did you kill my men?
- Oh God! Why would l kill?

884
01:05:28,972 --> 01:05:31,998
Guru, you're framing me in murder
case because of personal revenge.

885
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:35,336
l'm innocent, please trust me.

886
01:05:35,511 --> 01:05:37,706
Don't trust him, pandu.
l'm sure he killed your men.

887
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,475
He thrashed goons in the pub.
- Me? ln pub?

888
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:43,812
l scolded them,
l never slapped them also.

889
01:05:43,987 --> 01:05:47,150
You slapped me.
They are nothing to you.- Me?

890
01:05:47,357 --> 01:05:49,882
Nephew, he changed get ups
and confused us,

891
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:51,857
he's confusing you now
by changing the topic,

892
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:54,861
l'm confirming, it's him, kill him.

893
01:05:56,733 --> 01:05:59,634
Sir...how many prayers l had
conducted in your home,

894
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:02,498
l offer obsequies to the dead,
why should l kill them?

895
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:04,936
please save me,
killing Brahmin is sin.

896
01:06:05,108 --> 01:06:10,410
Tell him to down the gun.
- l still can't believe it's him.

897
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:13,549
Why would he come to my home
after killing my men?

898
01:06:13,716 --> 01:06:15,115
Let's lock him up here,

899
01:06:15,618 --> 01:06:17,950
if another incident happens,
then it's not him.

900
01:06:18,121 --> 01:06:19,281
What do you say?

901
01:06:20,323 --> 01:06:24,157
Why are you taking me again?
l'm innocent sir...

902
01:06:24,327 --> 01:06:28,058
l'm sure he'll fail in this test. Bye.
- Stop.

903
01:06:28,431 --> 01:06:30,422
Lock him also.

904
01:06:30,633 --> 01:06:34,262
We conducted functions together
but not murders, leave me.

905
01:06:42,412 --> 01:06:45,438
Tell me.
- We found Major's son.

906
01:06:46,783 --> 01:06:47,943
Yes sir.

907
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:57,792
What a great news you've for me!
l'm coming there.

908
01:06:58,294 --> 01:07:00,922
Narasimha! What are you doing now?

909
01:07:41,804 --> 01:07:46,764
O maiden!
l can't bear such great beauty!

910
01:07:50,246 --> 01:07:55,047
Don't take away my life with your
sharp eyes and devastating body...

911
01:07:58,454 --> 01:08:03,448
lt's not my mistake,
ask my grandmother...

912
01:08:07,096 --> 01:08:11,590
Why did she raise me so lovely
with great care?

913
01:08:14,637 --> 01:08:18,801
Oh God! Hot passions are
taking over me...

914
01:08:18,975 --> 01:08:23,605
Do l've to spend my nights sleepless?

915
01:09:21,637 --> 01:09:27,576
pink lips...black tresses
...fair heart...

916
01:09:27,743 --> 01:09:29,938
Unite me with you...

917
01:09:30,112 --> 01:09:35,914
Sexy waist...stylish walk...
romance of youth...

918
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:38,246
Make your heart my abode...

919
01:09:38,454 --> 01:09:42,515
You're my love...l'm your man...

920
01:09:42,692 --> 01:09:46,594
Shall we go together to
beautiful Arabian desert?

921
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,545
Don't follow me like a lion...

922
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:48,622
Don't worry for being single...

923
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:52,591
As darkness envelops...
sleep in my arms...

924
01:10:52,762 --> 01:10:56,858
Don't shrill like anklets...
Don't squeal like bangles...

925
01:10:57,033 --> 01:11:00,969
Don't shriek like a chain...
unite with me...

926
01:11:01,137 --> 01:11:05,267
May l come to you dear?
May l kiss you, my love?

927
01:11:05,408 --> 01:11:09,401
l must thank profoundly
your grand mother...

928
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:58,493
Out sider has entered our business,

929
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:01,254
few days back Rasool lost men
and recently l lost my men,

930
01:12:01,597 --> 01:12:03,189
we lost big money,

931
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:06,261
let's settle the differences
between us later,

932
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:09,394
we can take on him only
if we stand united,

933
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:10,502
that's why l called this meeting.

934
01:12:10,706 --> 01:12:13,106
Let's kill him, tell me who is he?
- How to catch him?

935
01:12:13,275 --> 01:12:16,767
Let's target MS,
the top most industrialist in the city,

936
01:12:16,946 --> 01:12:18,413
let's demand huge amount,

937
01:12:19,315 --> 01:12:23,615
l'm sure he will come for the money,
we'll lynch him.

938
01:12:32,261 --> 01:12:34,252
Go...go....

939
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:43,934
You think you got saved
because of gun jam,

940
01:12:44,106 --> 01:12:46,404
l made it purposefully not to open,

941
01:12:46,542 --> 01:12:48,510
the killer too doesn't know it.

942
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:50,975
What do you want?
- Rs.5 crores.

943
01:12:51,147 --> 01:12:52,705
This time gun will go off.

944
01:12:52,882 --> 01:12:54,281
l'll pay, where should l come?

945
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,782
Come to Attapur cement factory.

946
01:13:10,099 --> 01:13:12,533
Are you following him?
- Yes.

947
01:13:12,702 --> 01:13:14,431
Don't miss under any circumstance.

948
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:18,199
Very big deal.
This is my last deal with you.

949
01:13:52,174 --> 01:13:53,106
Rs.5 crores.

950
01:13:53,509 --> 01:13:54,100
You go.

951
01:14:00,216 --> 01:14:02,116
Why hasn't he come yet?

952
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,288
ls the priest still there?

953
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:19,258
No, he's not here. Escaped.
- How did he escape?

954
01:14:19,435 --> 01:14:21,995
Why do you get tensed?
He'll come here.

955
01:14:24,807 --> 01:14:25,432
He's here!

956
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:29,777
Thanks for coming.

957
01:14:46,762 --> 01:14:50,357
Offering prayers as priest,
silently killing men,

958
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:52,091
were you planning to fool us?

959
01:14:52,268 --> 01:14:55,499
prayers? l think you've
lost mind in the shock.

960
01:14:55,638 --> 01:14:56,627
Consult a doctor.

961
01:14:56,839 --> 01:15:00,502
You're surrounded by my men,
how bravely you speak like that!

962
01:15:00,643 --> 01:15:02,270
That's the only thing l have.

963
01:15:12,888 --> 01:15:16,051
Looks like you've been trapped!

964
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:20,720
How dare you love my daughter!

965
01:15:21,197 --> 01:15:24,530
When l can tap their phones,
can't l tap your phone?

966
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:27,431
Die...die in their hands.

967
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:29,606
Surprized to see the man who
wanted you dead saving your life?

968
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:36,781
He saved you because
l want your life.

969
01:19:40,856 --> 01:19:43,450
l brought you here.
Who is he?

970
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:45,923
He's Naik l told you about.

971
01:19:46,128 --> 01:19:49,256
Thanks for your help,
from now you're also my man.

972
01:19:50,732 --> 01:19:54,634
l brought you this far
because l need you.

973
01:19:54,803 --> 01:19:57,966
To know the need,
l've to tell you a story.

974
01:19:58,307 --> 01:20:00,002
Your father was
a weapons designer in army,

975
01:20:00,209 --> 01:20:01,938
he designed a weapon,

976
01:20:03,879 --> 01:20:07,576
l asked him to give the design,
because that's my business,

977
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:10,513
he refused, then l flipped through the
pages of your dad's past,

978
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:13,450
l hit up on your dad's
close friend Dhanraj,

979
01:20:13,622 --> 01:20:16,182
l used his friendship
to kidnap your father,

980
01:20:16,358 --> 01:20:18,952
your father later died in an accident,

981
01:20:19,161 --> 01:20:22,096
of course l arranged that accident,

982
01:20:24,867 --> 01:20:27,427
shall l give you a surprize?
Your father is still alive.

983
01:20:30,272 --> 01:20:34,333
l'm investing billions on your father
to design a weapon,

984
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:39,205
just 6 months away from completion
your dad gave me a shock,

985
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:44,444
he wants his family,
it took many days to find you.

986
01:21:06,008 --> 01:21:06,770
Father!

987
01:21:07,209 --> 01:21:11,441
Major, you insisted on family,
here's your son.

988
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:19,312
Your father doubts
authenticity of you.

989
01:21:19,488 --> 01:21:22,423
l'll never play games in
such serious matters.

990
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:25,151
lt's your responsibility to prove
that you're his son.

991
01:21:25,327 --> 01:21:26,259
prove it.

992
01:21:27,062 --> 01:21:31,863
l'm away from my family for many years
and working for him as dead man,

993
01:21:32,034 --> 01:21:35,663
please don't cheat me.
Tell me the truth....you are...

994
01:21:35,837 --> 01:21:36,496
Father!

995
01:21:36,972 --> 01:21:40,339
l'm your son. Just a minute.

996
01:21:44,546 --> 01:21:46,980
Mother, hold on the line.

997
01:21:47,115 --> 01:21:48,605
A man will talk to you.

998
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:57,918
Hubby!

999
01:22:09,738 --> 01:22:13,196
Who said there are no sentiments?
Look at their emotions.

1000
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:20,076
lt's not safe to keep son here for long.
He's very cunning!

1001
01:22:20,449 --> 01:22:21,575
Let's shift him.

1002
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:24,014
Father, you don't worry.

1003
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:26,552
l'll not let them take the
weapon designed by you,

1004
01:22:26,722 --> 01:22:30,453
l'll free you from here, father.
- He told me you're very cunning.

1005
01:22:33,462 --> 01:22:37,364
Will you take him?
Will you take your father with you?

1006
01:22:37,532 --> 01:22:40,023
You can't even locate this island.

1007
01:22:40,235 --> 01:22:44,262
Governments of 14 countries
shake up on hearing my name.

1008
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,431
Shall l kill your father?
- No.

1009
01:22:50,879 --> 01:22:54,542
Your son will be with me in Calcutta,

1010
01:22:54,716 --> 01:22:57,879
l'm giving you a month's time,
finish it.

1011
01:22:58,053 --> 01:23:01,955
lf you don't finish it in a month,
l'll clip a part of your son's body.

1012
01:23:02,124 --> 01:23:05,924
Be careful.
- please don't harm my son.- Finish it.

1013
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:27,441
Where is he?

1014
01:23:35,757 --> 01:23:37,782
Who is he?
He looks very tough.

1015
01:23:37,926 --> 01:23:40,861
Our Major's son, he'll stay with us.

1016
01:23:41,029 --> 01:23:43,759
lt's your responsibility
to keep him safely here.

1017
01:23:43,932 --> 01:23:45,559
Don't give me such risky jobs.
- Why?

1018
01:23:45,734 --> 01:23:47,531
l feel controlling him is difficult.
- Why?

1019
01:23:47,703 --> 01:23:49,933
Think logically,
you'll know the risk in it.

1020
01:23:50,105 --> 01:23:50,799
What is it?

1021
01:23:50,972 --> 01:23:56,638
We can only threaten Major with death,
can't kill him till he completes it.

1022
01:23:56,812 --> 01:23:57,870
Yes, we can't.

1023
01:23:58,647 --> 01:24:01,810
When he gets that idea,
he needn't have to be with us.

1024
01:24:01,983 --> 01:24:03,450
He'll escape!

1025
01:24:06,621 --> 01:24:07,781
Bloody idiot!

1026
01:24:18,266 --> 01:24:19,233
Don't shoot him!

1027
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:20,731
lf anything happens to him,
we'll be in trouble.

1028
01:24:20,902 --> 01:24:22,597
Tell him!
- Yes brother.

1029
01:25:01,643 --> 01:25:04,441
Have you closed all the doors?
How can he come out now?

1030
01:25:06,415 --> 01:25:08,246
lt's him!

1031
01:25:43,618 --> 01:25:45,552
Enough...enough of it.

1032
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,019
You're not able to understand,
if you escape, l'll be in trouble.

1033
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:51,091
You can't go anywhere, come.

1034
01:25:51,693 --> 01:25:52,751
Come!

1035
01:26:03,772 --> 01:26:06,605
Take my mother and hide her
somewhere. Be careful!

1036
01:26:06,775 --> 01:26:07,571
What happened?

1037
01:26:07,742 --> 01:26:11,109
l'll tell you later,
first do what l told you.- Okay.

1038
01:26:34,703 --> 01:26:37,501
Bloody! Why did you give an idea
which he didn't get?

1039
01:26:37,672 --> 01:26:39,367
l didn't expect this turn.

1040
01:26:39,574 --> 01:26:41,667
l said it for logic,
he did it practically.

1041
01:26:41,843 --> 01:26:43,538
He's not a man to run away,

1042
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:46,272
if he has run it means
he has a plan.

1043
01:26:46,414 --> 01:26:48,541
Keep quiet sir, don't raise his tension.

1044
01:26:48,717 --> 01:26:54,417
Think not about him,
what if major wants to talk to his son.

1045
01:26:57,292 --> 01:26:59,283
ls it from Major?
- Yes.

1046
01:26:59,494 --> 01:27:01,257
Don't look at me, answer his call
and say something.

1047
01:27:01,396 --> 01:27:02,385
Tell him.

1048
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:06,594
Give the phone to my son.

1049
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:09,903
He's not with me, l'm outside.

1050
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:13,563
Am l your son's pA?
Don't call on phone, do your work.

1051
01:27:13,742 --> 01:27:18,543
l'll start working after
talking to my son.

1052
01:27:19,714 --> 01:27:21,204
What did he say?

1053
01:27:21,383 --> 01:27:23,214
Did he say he'll start working
after talking to his son?

1054
01:27:23,385 --> 01:27:24,852
No, he asked me to kill you.

1055
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,317
How could you guess everything right?

1056
01:27:26,521 --> 01:27:28,216
Give me a chance.

1057
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:31,826
l'll go to Hyderabad and abduct
any of his relative or friend.

1058
01:27:31,993 --> 01:27:32,687
How will you get hold of them?

1059
01:27:32,861 --> 01:27:35,386
One of my friends is
member of Rasool's gang.

1060
01:27:35,597 --> 01:27:36,529
l'll seek his help to find them.

1061
01:27:36,698 --> 01:27:39,326
Nobody is alive in Rasool's gang,
he killed all of them.

1062
01:27:39,467 --> 01:27:42,129
Won't you ever talk positively?
Always pessimistic!

1063
01:27:42,304 --> 01:27:44,966
My friend could be alive, right?
please give me a chance.

1064
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,334
Call him.

1065
01:27:50,645 --> 01:27:52,112
Switch on the speaker.

1066
01:27:56,551 --> 01:27:57,950
One minute.

1067
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:02,353
No smiles here,
pick up the phone man.

1068
01:28:06,328 --> 01:28:09,491
Basha bhai, l'm Meta from Calcutta.
- Meta?

1069
01:28:09,698 --> 01:28:13,190
You used to cal me as broker
when you were young.

1070
01:28:13,368 --> 01:28:14,767
lt's me Calcutta Meta.

1071
01:28:14,936 --> 01:28:17,268
Who ever you may be,
Rs.15 for a pant, Rs.10 for a shirt,

1072
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:20,067
Rs.5 for underwear,
lf you give two pants, one shirt free,

1073
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:21,367
for two shirts, one underwear free,

1074
01:28:21,509 --> 01:28:22,999
taxes extra, fixed rates.

1075
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:24,509
How come you've changed totally?

1076
01:28:24,713 --> 01:28:26,476
l didn't change, a man changed me.

1077
01:28:26,681 --> 01:28:28,376
He wiped out all the gangs.

1078
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,279
My finances went dry and
l started a dry cleaning shop.

1079
01:28:31,453 --> 01:28:32,886
l need a help from you.

1080
01:28:33,054 --> 01:28:35,318
l'm interested only in dirty clothes
not with men.

1081
01:28:35,457 --> 01:28:37,118
lf you help, it'll save my life.

1082
01:28:37,258 --> 01:28:39,658
l served free in your younger days.

1083
01:28:39,828 --> 01:28:43,491
l'll take any risk
till my life is not in risk.

1084
01:28:44,099 --> 01:28:47,591
My friend is alive,
l'll bring someone related to Major.

1085
01:28:47,769 --> 01:28:48,360
Trust me.

1086
01:28:48,503 --> 01:28:52,200
Okay, you will bring, but how will
you communicate to this man?

1087
01:28:52,374 --> 01:28:53,636
Let's take care of it then.

1088
01:28:54,009 --> 01:28:56,637
Send his photo to me as MMS.

1089
01:28:56,811 --> 01:28:58,403
Why do you need a photo?
You've seen him, haven't you?

1090
01:28:58,546 --> 01:29:03,210
l've seen him but
my friend must see him, right?

1091
01:29:03,952 --> 01:29:08,218
He!- l escaped from this man only
and you've come for him.

1092
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:11,154
lf you go to him, you'll die.
- l'll die even if l don't.

1093
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:13,556
please take me to him.

1094
01:29:14,362 --> 01:29:19,891
l can't take you to him but l'll take
you to a priest his look alike.

1095
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:23,560
A priest like him?
- Show me.

1096
01:29:23,772 --> 01:29:26,263
l saw him while escaping from him.

1097
01:29:31,513 --> 01:29:32,912
lt means they two.

1098
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:35,914
You mean to take priest in his place.

1099
01:29:36,384 --> 01:29:37,646
What if my boss finds this?

1100
01:29:37,819 --> 01:29:40,014
Die is one, you can take
as many copies as possible.

1101
01:29:40,188 --> 01:29:42,019
He's Baba, he may recognise him.

1102
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:45,091
l myself couldn't recognise him,
how can Baba recognise him?

1103
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,091
Will he come with us?

1104
01:29:47,262 --> 01:29:50,425
He may come for big money.
- l'll pay in full cash.

1105
01:29:53,435 --> 01:29:56,131
Bad time may set in,
put the ring immediately, Chari.

1106
01:29:56,304 --> 01:29:57,328
Stop it!

1107
01:29:57,472 --> 01:29:59,440
You can't put rings
or exchange offers later.

1108
01:29:59,574 --> 01:30:01,838
For the present, engagement is stopped.

1109
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:05,446
What's this Bhattu? lnstead of
blessing them you're stopping it.

1110
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,480
This is bad too.
- lt's bad for me too.

1111
01:30:07,682 --> 01:30:10,150
ls my love failure at this age
a small matter?

1112
01:30:10,318 --> 01:30:14,015
So l got a stay order from High Court
to stop this engagement.

1113
01:30:14,189 --> 01:30:15,156
Read it lawyer.

1114
01:30:15,323 --> 01:30:19,191
Yes sir, court has decreed to stop
engagement till you settle his loan.

1115
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,761
This is very strange, l heard about stay
orders on buildings and businesses.

1116
01:30:22,931 --> 01:30:26,332
Will they stop functions too?
- They will, that is law.

1117
01:30:26,501 --> 01:30:28,298
You hit me with love
and l hit back with law.

1118
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:30,438
Rs.15 lakhs l had invested
on Chandrakala,

1119
01:30:30,572 --> 01:30:32,039
and Rs.4 lakhs due from you,

1120
01:30:32,207 --> 01:30:34,334
l must get Rs.19 lakhs
to let you unite.

1121
01:30:34,509 --> 01:30:37,501
Bhattu, you promised to save us
but hell bent on ruining us now.

1122
01:30:37,712 --> 01:30:40,306
l wanted to save you but
you played with me.

1123
01:30:40,482 --> 01:30:41,881
That's why l'm stopping you.

1124
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:44,450
Let anyone create hurdle this
engagement will go on as scheduled.

1125
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:46,778
He?- You...?
- lt's me.

1126
01:30:46,955 --> 01:30:50,015
He's exactly like him.
- That's why l brought you here.

1127
01:30:50,191 --> 01:30:51,453
How much he has to pay you?

1128
01:30:51,593 --> 01:30:55,927
l mean Rs.19 lakhs.
- Take rs.20 lakhs with tip.

1129
01:30:56,164 --> 01:30:58,598
l'll pay in full cash.

1130
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:01,432
Why are you paying so much for him?

1131
01:31:01,603 --> 01:31:02,865
You want money or reason?

1132
01:31:03,037 --> 01:31:04,937
l want Chandrakala.
- l'll kill you.

1133
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:07,106
l'll lynch you! Get out!

1134
01:31:09,544 --> 01:31:12,877
How am l to repay your gratitude?

1135
01:31:13,047 --> 01:31:16,016
Few days of your life.
- Want me to conduct any sacrifice?

1136
01:31:16,184 --> 01:31:18,448
No. You must act.
- Act? Are you making any film?

1137
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:20,850
No, there's another majust like you.

1138
01:31:21,022 --> 01:31:23,547
We too got affected as you
for his deeds.

1139
01:31:23,691 --> 01:31:26,489
When l told you about a man like me,
you didn't believe me, granny.

1140
01:31:26,628 --> 01:31:27,856
How can l not believe you?

1141
01:31:28,029 --> 01:31:30,327
You know there will be
7 look alikes in this world.

1142
01:31:30,498 --> 01:31:33,126
Let's stop with just two, grandma.
You explain to them.

1143
01:31:33,301 --> 01:31:34,962
His boss is notorious don in Calcutta.

1144
01:31:35,136 --> 01:31:37,468
He escaped from him.
- He means this guy?

1145
01:31:37,639 --> 01:31:39,004
No. The man like you.

1146
01:31:39,174 --> 01:31:41,108
You don't go with him
he threatened to kill him.

1147
01:31:41,276 --> 01:31:43,073
He means the man like me, right?
- No, he means his boss.

1148
01:31:43,244 --> 01:31:46,111
Just now you said he means
my look alike, now you say his boss.

1149
01:31:46,281 --> 01:31:49,944
Earlier he was your look alike,
later he was his boss.

1150
01:31:50,118 --> 01:31:51,415
What happened to him then?
- Him means?

1151
01:31:51,586 --> 01:31:52,314
l mean my look alike.

1152
01:31:52,487 --> 01:31:54,580
No need of anything,
let's take him with us.

1153
01:31:54,722 --> 01:31:56,883
please show some pity...
- What my son is supposed to do?

1154
01:31:57,058 --> 01:31:59,583
Your son must exact like him,
if you want take another 30.

1155
01:31:59,727 --> 01:32:02,662
30 mean thousands, right?
- lt's lakhs!- Lakhs?

1156
01:32:02,831 --> 01:32:04,264
Lakhs!

1157
01:32:05,333 --> 01:32:07,096
Will you accept?

1158
01:32:07,268 --> 01:32:10,465
lt'll take years to
earn such huge money.

1159
01:32:10,605 --> 01:32:12,573
Will you let him do anything for money?

1160
01:32:12,707 --> 01:32:14,265
He's our only heir,
what if anything happens to him?

1161
01:32:14,442 --> 01:32:16,603
Nothing will happen, grandma.
please don't stop them.

1162
01:32:16,744 --> 01:32:19,144
You come there and
say just three words.

1163
01:32:19,314 --> 01:32:23,478
Just three words only,
not a word more than it.

1164
01:32:23,618 --> 01:32:25,745
Okay, but you need to
change your get up.

1165
01:32:25,954 --> 01:32:28,616
Can l avoid it after
accepting your offer?

1166
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:32,717
What are you saying?
- Yes, l've brought him. Look!

1167
01:32:47,642 --> 01:32:50,133
Bloody! How dare you escape from me?

1168
01:32:50,311 --> 01:32:51,835
Where did you think of going away?

1169
01:32:52,013 --> 01:32:53,947
What's your plan?
- Tell me your plan.

1170
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:57,175
Don't know, forgot, don't remember.
- What is this?

1171
01:32:58,353 --> 01:33:00,753
l mean we hit on his head on seeing him.

1172
01:33:00,955 --> 01:33:03,355
Ever since then he has been
saying these three words only.

1173
01:33:03,524 --> 01:33:05,014
lf you disturb him,
he may forget that also.

1174
01:33:05,193 --> 01:33:09,254
l suspect him, Baba.
ls he the same man?

1175
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:12,092
Will you please keep quiet?
Why do you always poke your nose?

1176
01:33:12,267 --> 01:33:14,565
Bring someone like you.
ls it that easy?

1177
01:33:14,736 --> 01:33:16,033
Will there be similar people?

1178
01:33:16,204 --> 01:33:18,104
l think he's very snoopy,
send him away.

1179
01:33:18,273 --> 01:33:20,434
No...
- Will you shut up?

1180
01:33:20,608 --> 01:33:24,169
We want him, if he asks,
we must show him. That's all.

1181
01:33:24,345 --> 01:33:27,872
His father is pestering to talk to him.

1182
01:33:28,049 --> 01:33:31,883
Don't know, forgot, don't remember,
this is what he says.

1183
01:33:32,053 --> 01:33:33,520
Can l train him to speak
three more words?

1184
01:33:33,688 --> 01:33:34,916
Training?
- Yes.

1185
01:33:35,089 --> 01:33:36,681
lf you tell me what to say,
l'll train him.

1186
01:33:36,824 --> 01:33:39,315
Who are you?- l'm his owner.
- Owner?

1187
01:33:39,494 --> 01:33:43,157
Wait, we can't answer their doubts.

1188
01:33:43,331 --> 01:33:47,165
Want to train him or not?
- Do something.

1189
01:33:47,335 --> 01:33:49,360
Come son.
- Come.

1190
01:33:49,537 --> 01:33:54,600
priest, if you speak 3 more words,
the job will be done.

1191
01:33:55,043 --> 01:33:56,670
You got paid, right?
- l forgot.

1192
01:33:56,811 --> 01:34:01,214
Why is saying this to us?
- Wait, they are stingy about fee.

1193
01:34:01,382 --> 01:34:03,213
This was really good.

1194
01:34:03,384 --> 01:34:05,113
Those 3 words...

1195
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:08,585
We'll pay. He'll pay.
- l'll pay.

1196
01:34:08,723 --> 01:34:14,525
Major! You were earning to see
your son, here's your son.

1197
01:34:15,163 --> 01:34:17,131
How are you son?

1198
01:34:17,298 --> 01:34:20,324
l'm fine, are you fine, father?

1199
01:34:20,501 --> 01:34:23,834
l'm fine.
They are not troubling you, right?

1200
01:34:24,038 --> 01:34:27,201
l'm fine, are you fine, father?

1201
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:30,310
Won't he speak anything other than this?

1202
01:34:30,478 --> 01:34:33,038
He knows a third one too.
Why isn't he speaking?

1203
01:34:33,214 --> 01:34:35,114
l think he has forgotten it.
He'll pick up slowly.

1204
01:34:35,283 --> 01:34:37,183
Tell me if you've any problem, son.

1205
01:34:37,352 --> 01:34:39,718
Okay father, l'll do as you say, father.

1206
01:34:39,854 --> 01:34:42,448
Third one is over.
- He'll start from the first.

1207
01:34:42,991 --> 01:34:44,185
Why are you talking differently, son?

1208
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:48,693
He's also mad like you with
swing of mood every minute.

1209
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:52,823
Major, the faster you finish it
the better for everyone.

1210
01:34:53,001 --> 01:34:58,598
Take good care of my son.
- We will.

1211
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:04,243
l didn't feel so tensed while
watching world cup match too.

1212
01:35:04,412 --> 01:35:08,109
Job is done, right?
- You take him away from here.

1213
01:35:08,683 --> 01:35:10,275
Come son.

1214
01:35:11,652 --> 01:35:16,385
You're very lucky. lf it's that man,
he'll escape often.

1215
01:35:16,557 --> 01:35:18,081
lf it's this man, he'll stay here only.

1216
01:35:18,259 --> 01:35:24,528
Who is he?
- Abhishek Bachchan's father...

1217
01:35:24,699 --> 01:35:29,932
After everything is ready,
if this man talks to Major like this,

1218
01:35:30,138 --> 01:35:33,005
Major may fear son's safety and
situation will be back to square one.

1219
01:35:33,174 --> 01:35:34,436
Think about it.

1220
01:35:35,176 --> 01:35:38,202
You needn't get tensed.

1221
01:35:38,379 --> 01:35:41,348
l'm sure his mother will be
in my daughter's control.

1222
01:35:41,516 --> 01:35:44,883
Because my daughter is his girl friend.

1223
01:35:45,386 --> 01:35:48,287
l'll bring his mother.

1224
01:35:51,159 --> 01:35:53,889
ls it you?- Yes, it's me.
- lt's very nice here.

1225
01:35:54,095 --> 01:35:58,623
These fools didn't pay even
Rs.5000 for half day's work.

1226
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,827
But here they are paying a lakh
for every word l speak. Trust me.

1227
01:36:03,037 --> 01:36:05,528
What are you trying to tell me?
Will you settle there only?

1228
01:36:05,706 --> 01:36:08,334
Why have any doubt?
Already settled here.

1229
01:36:08,509 --> 01:36:11,808
Don't get surprized
if l become Don Chari.

1230
01:36:11,946 --> 01:36:13,277
Don?
- Don!

1231
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:51,318
Where is your dhoti?
Where is your old bike?

1232
01:36:51,486 --> 01:36:54,455
Where is your old style, Chari?

1233
01:36:56,691 --> 01:37:02,095
What's this new suit, boot,
French cut, and Gulf scent, Chari?

1234
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:06,530
l don't want dhoti and old bike...

1235
01:37:06,701 --> 01:37:08,168
l don't want the old style, my girl...

1236
01:37:08,336 --> 01:37:14,332
l like this new suit, boot,
French cut, and Gulf scent, O my girl...

1237
01:37:14,509 --> 01:37:19,208
You were cute like farex baby,
but have now turned into a RDX bomb...

1238
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:25,285
To match with your Rolex body,
l remixed myself...

1239
01:37:27,922 --> 01:37:28,889
Stripped it!

1240
01:37:29,123 --> 01:37:30,249
Cut it!

1241
01:37:30,525 --> 01:37:31,514
Wiped it!

1242
01:37:49,911 --> 01:37:52,778
Oh God! He steals hearts!

1243
01:38:07,795 --> 01:38:12,698
You never drink water without
seeing inauspicious time...

1244
01:38:12,867 --> 01:38:17,930
You went overboard and
said good morning with your lips...

1245
01:38:23,044 --> 01:38:25,444
O maiden, as per the sentiment...

1246
01:38:25,613 --> 01:38:28,047
l slipped and stamped the fox's tail...

1247
01:38:28,249 --> 01:38:33,949
That luck gave me more kick, my dear...

1248
01:38:38,359 --> 01:38:43,661
You were like vermicelli upma
but now become like Chinese noodles...

1249
01:38:43,831 --> 01:38:49,531
l changed my style for
a Miss Femina like you...

1250
01:39:42,623 --> 01:39:47,424
lf l rewind your story, you were
innocent like hero of 'Swathimuthyam'...

1251
01:39:57,605 --> 01:40:02,565
Don't know when my tongue slipped
and chanted hymns wrongly...

1252
01:40:02,743 --> 01:40:08,272
My flashback went kaput
and ended up like this, O girl...

1253
01:40:12,987 --> 01:40:17,924
You were like local red bus
but now become stylish like airbus...

1254
01:40:18,092 --> 01:40:23,928
l've changed myself to
stand up to your golden beauty...

1255
01:40:55,196 --> 01:40:59,963
Brother-in-law, you called me
from Calcutta but you're silent.

1256
01:41:00,134 --> 01:41:01,761
ls it love failure?

1257
01:41:01,936 --> 01:41:05,099
l think this scene is
unavoidable for any lover.

1258
01:41:05,239 --> 01:41:07,571
Won't you be happy
if l get married?

1259
01:41:07,742 --> 01:41:13,374
l may not be able to bless
you but l'll be happy.

1260
01:41:13,547 --> 01:41:16,141
Chari ruined my happiness.

1261
01:41:16,283 --> 01:41:19,582
l spent all my earnings on
Chandrakala and dating her,

1262
01:41:19,754 --> 01:41:21,278
he took her from my side
to his side.

1263
01:41:21,489 --> 01:41:23,650
You've to step aside,
what else can we do?

1264
01:41:23,824 --> 01:41:26,725
We can do. Do you know
who Baba in Calcutta is?

1265
01:41:26,894 --> 01:41:29,158
l hear he's a don,
what do you want him for?

1266
01:41:29,296 --> 01:41:32,265
He has gone to cheat
him also along with me.

1267
01:41:32,466 --> 01:41:35,765
How?
- There's a man just like him.

1268
01:41:35,936 --> 01:41:42,603
There's talk here that Chari went
there to act like him for big money.

1269
01:41:42,777 --> 01:41:44,677
On inquiry l found it was true.

1270
01:41:44,845 --> 01:41:46,745
We must tell this truth to Baba.

1271
01:41:46,914 --> 01:41:48,939
Not a big deal,
let's find his address.

1272
01:41:49,116 --> 01:41:51,880
lf he misses, we must finish him.

1273
01:41:52,052 --> 01:41:53,144
Be prepared for that too.

1274
01:41:53,287 --> 01:41:56,654
We needn't do it,
there are many to do it for us.

1275
01:41:56,824 --> 01:41:58,758
Finish him means kill him.

1276
01:41:58,926 --> 01:42:01,258
l didn't expect so much fire in you.

1277
01:42:01,429 --> 01:42:03,920
Not only you, didn't l too expect.

1278
01:42:15,109 --> 01:42:17,270
Have you quit?

1279
01:42:17,845 --> 01:42:18,869
Go away!

1280
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:23,746
Did you call for inauguration
ceremony, Sheela aunt?

1281
01:42:23,918 --> 01:42:27,513
Yes sir, from your place only.

1282
01:42:27,688 --> 01:42:29,849
That's why l called you, go in.

1283
01:42:30,024 --> 01:42:31,150
Still in dress?

1284
01:42:31,292 --> 01:42:34,125
Are you from Andhra?
- Yes.

1285
01:42:34,295 --> 01:42:35,922
You're lucky to get me
as the first client.

1286
01:42:36,096 --> 01:42:38,291
Every girl who had me first
became very famous.

1287
01:42:38,466 --> 01:42:40,229
Mine is lucky hand.

1288
01:42:45,473 --> 01:42:48,237
Who is he? That man or this man?
Who are you?

1289
01:42:49,543 --> 01:42:50,237
He's that man!

1290
01:42:50,444 --> 01:42:54,039
l came here for fun,
fighting doesn't suit me, bye.

1291
01:42:54,215 --> 01:42:56,240
Where's the island in which
my father is kidnapped?

1292
01:42:56,450 --> 01:42:59,578
Trust me, l don't know.
Not only me, nobody here knows it.

1293
01:42:59,753 --> 01:43:04,019
Baba keeps it secret from everyone.
But Dhanraj knows it. Trust me.

1294
01:43:04,191 --> 01:43:05,453
Where can l find Dhanraj?

1295
01:43:05,626 --> 01:43:07,457
Nobody knows his whereabouts.

1296
01:43:07,628 --> 01:43:09,653
But every Friday he visits Cyclone pub.

1297
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:11,320
You'll definitely find him there.

1298
01:43:11,532 --> 01:43:15,400
Leave me, many women
are dependent on me.

1299
01:43:17,404 --> 01:43:23,604
Goddess Kali, see that nobody comes
here to tell the truth of twins to Baba.

1300
01:43:24,211 --> 01:43:26,406
Take Baba's address.

1301
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:33,652
What are you saying?
- Yes, he's in Calcutta.

1302
01:43:33,821 --> 01:43:34,753
Thinking about him is
giving me shivers.

1303
01:43:34,922 --> 01:43:35,684
Why didn't you catch him?

1304
01:43:35,856 --> 01:43:37,915
lf you see a tiger,
you escape not try to catch it.

1305
01:43:38,092 --> 01:43:40,856
Someone from Hyderabad is
here to meet Narasimha.

1306
01:43:41,362 --> 01:43:42,829
Who would it be?

1307
01:43:43,597 --> 01:43:47,124
ls it you, Guru?
- You changed your style.

1308
01:43:47,301 --> 01:43:50,634
What brings you here?

1309
01:43:50,804 --> 01:43:53,534
l didn't come,
vengeance has brought me here.

1310
01:43:53,707 --> 01:43:56,835
Why are you talking like a villain?
- Yes, l'm a villain.

1311
01:43:57,011 --> 01:44:00,310
l should've been a hero, you and
Chandu joined to make me a villain.

1312
01:44:00,447 --> 01:44:02,415
What do you want now?

1313
01:44:03,717 --> 01:44:05,981
lt's sin! We are already engaged.

1314
01:44:06,153 --> 01:44:08,087
lf l tell you the truth,
your obsequies will be over.

1315
01:44:08,255 --> 01:44:10,917
Truth?
- That you're not what you're now.

1316
01:44:11,158 --> 01:44:13,786
The truth about your contract to act.

1317
01:44:13,961 --> 01:44:17,294
You know better than me what will
happen if Baba comes know this.

1318
01:44:17,431 --> 01:44:19,558
That's all?
- Yes, your end.

1319
01:44:19,733 --> 01:44:20,722
Won't you change your heart?

1320
01:44:20,901 --> 01:44:23,426
When l get angry l don't change
my brief, heart is nothing.

1321
01:44:23,637 --> 01:44:25,764
Okay, give me a minute.

1322
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:29,106
What?
- He's here seeking revenge.

1323
01:44:29,276 --> 01:44:32,268
Threatening to tell the truth to Baba.
- l'll kill him.

1324
01:44:32,413 --> 01:44:33,607
Why?

1325
01:44:34,114 --> 01:44:36,878
We must cheat him not kill him.

1326
01:44:37,051 --> 01:44:39,417
He has come to wrong place
at wrong time.

1327
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:41,178
He mustn't go out.

1328
01:44:41,355 --> 01:44:44,119
Baba's right hand Basha is calling you,

1329
01:44:44,258 --> 01:44:46,886
he's in that room, meet and tell him.

1330
01:44:47,061 --> 01:44:48,358
Come whatsoever it may!

1331
01:44:48,562 --> 01:44:51,258
You've become very dare.
l'll teach you a lesson.

1332
01:44:52,866 --> 01:44:54,766
Greetings sir.
- Close the door.

1333
01:44:55,202 --> 01:44:57,932
Tell me.
- The man here is ...

1334
01:45:03,110 --> 01:45:07,444
l heard fire crackers busting.
Guru! Did you kill Basha?

1335
01:45:07,648 --> 01:45:10,139
Killed him? When l entered
the room, lights went off.

1336
01:45:10,317 --> 01:45:12,512
When lights came back, gun is
in my hand and body is there.

1337
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,688
lt's known as murder here.

1338
01:45:19,093 --> 01:45:20,253
Are you dead?

1339
01:45:20,861 --> 01:45:22,453
You killed him.
- l don't know.

1340
01:45:22,630 --> 01:45:24,757
Will you kill our Basha?
- No.

1341
01:45:24,932 --> 01:45:27,867
Will you cut Baba's right hand?
- l didn't do it.

1342
01:45:30,104 --> 01:45:34,404
Meta, please stop.
please forgive him for my sake.

1343
01:45:34,608 --> 01:45:37,099
Even if l forgive him, Baba will not.

1344
01:45:38,379 --> 01:45:41,940
Save me please.
- We are ready to do anything.

1345
01:45:42,116 --> 01:45:44,414
Okay, l'm leaving him for your sake.

1346
01:45:44,618 --> 01:45:46,882
Baba will be here now,
let's first dispose the body.

1347
01:45:47,054 --> 01:45:50,717
Soul will not rest if you throw body
in sea without conducting rituals.

1348
01:45:50,891 --> 01:45:53,086
Are you talking about rituals
after killing him?

1349
01:45:54,428 --> 01:45:55,759
please stop his abuses.

1350
01:45:55,929 --> 01:45:58,295
please stop your wild abuses.

1351
01:45:58,432 --> 01:46:01,424
You forget about rituals, you come.

1352
01:46:06,573 --> 01:46:09,337
l never expected to get
caught in murder case.

1353
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:11,944
l too didn't expect
to get murdered.

1354
01:46:16,583 --> 01:46:17,743
What happened, Guru?

1355
01:46:17,918 --> 01:46:19,112
Basha is still alive.
- Where?

1356
01:46:19,286 --> 01:46:21,277
lnside.
- Who is he then?

1357
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:25,417
He's Basha, right!
Who was he then?

1358
01:46:25,559 --> 01:46:27,083
You may have mistaken
someone else for him.

1359
01:46:27,261 --> 01:46:29,752
How can l mistake?
Don't l know the man l killed?

1360
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:30,954
Then is it you who killed him?

1361
01:46:31,131 --> 01:46:33,463
Calm down, l said that in a flow.

1362
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,592
Chari, tell him take away the body.
- Take care fo the body.

1363
01:46:36,804 --> 01:46:39,272
l'm taking because you told me.
lf not...- No.

1364
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:42,432
We belong to Brahmin community,
but he's freely using bad words.

1365
01:46:42,576 --> 01:46:45,443
please stop abusing and
take care of the body.

1366
01:46:45,579 --> 01:46:46,546
Okay.

1367
01:46:55,222 --> 01:46:57,122
Have you bid adieu to my body?

1368
01:46:57,257 --> 01:46:59,418
Look there Basha!

1369
01:46:59,793 --> 01:47:02,261
Where?
- Can't you see him?

1370
01:47:02,429 --> 01:47:04,260
Souls are not visible to all.

1371
01:47:04,798 --> 01:47:06,265
lt seems soul is speaking to me.

1372
01:47:06,433 --> 01:47:09,334
No soul or ghost,
you're blabbering in shock.

1373
01:47:09,503 --> 01:47:12,495
l'm not seen or heard
by anyone except you.

1374
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:16,097
Why that exclusive facility to me?
- Because you killed me.

1375
01:47:16,443 --> 01:47:19,435
From now you're my companion,
l'm your shadow.

1376
01:47:47,975 --> 01:47:52,605
Come...come...where are you guys?

1377
01:48:05,859 --> 01:48:08,521
You...?- Any doubt?

1378
01:48:08,662 --> 01:48:12,792
l knew it, l got doubt when
you played a drama.

1379
01:48:12,966 --> 01:48:17,528
You're playing drama,
where's the island with my father?

1380
01:48:17,771 --> 01:48:20,672
l'll not tell whatever you may do.

1381
01:48:21,508 --> 01:48:24,272
You will tell!

1382
01:48:32,586 --> 01:48:35,953
Will you tell now?
- l will. l'll tell.

1383
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:42,925
He's in Bard island about
160 kms from Kalighat.

1384
01:48:43,263 --> 01:48:47,199
Even if you go there,
you can't free your father.

1385
01:48:47,367 --> 01:48:48,527
Why?

1386
01:48:49,203 --> 01:48:53,606
Your father's lab is
made of heavy metal,

1387
01:48:54,942 --> 01:48:58,275
even 100 kgs of RDX can't break it open.

1388
01:48:58,612 --> 01:49:01,945
There's a code to open it.

1389
01:49:02,316 --> 01:49:04,750
Only Baba knows it.

1390
01:49:05,452 --> 01:49:11,914
Details about the code
is in his laptop.

1391
01:49:13,527 --> 01:49:16,428
Free me.

1392
01:49:17,331 --> 01:49:20,528
lt must be decided by my father not me.

1393
01:49:20,834 --> 01:49:25,430
Till then be my guest.
- Release me.

1394
01:49:27,975 --> 01:49:31,536
Thanks, l wouldn't have got this idea
if you hadn't shouted.

1395
01:49:31,712 --> 01:49:33,111
Take rest.

1396
01:50:00,674 --> 01:50:02,437
What are you doing here?
Go sleep.

1397
01:50:25,299 --> 01:50:26,288
What Guru?

1398
01:50:26,466 --> 01:50:29,924
Relaxing listening to songs.
- Yes. very nice, you too join.

1399
01:50:30,103 --> 01:50:31,764
No relaxation in my life.

1400
01:50:31,972 --> 01:50:35,703
l'll tell you a secret, don't tell anyone.
- Tell me.

1401
01:50:35,909 --> 01:50:39,276
l'm planning to escape tonight.
- Why?

1402
01:50:39,446 --> 01:50:43,780
That soul is torturing me,
l feel like hiding elsewhere.

1403
01:50:43,984 --> 01:50:45,952
Where ever you may go,
soul will follow you.

1404
01:50:46,119 --> 01:50:46,778
How can it come?

1405
01:50:46,987 --> 01:50:49,012
Souls don't need tickets
and passports.

1406
01:50:49,189 --> 01:50:50,451
You're right.

1407
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:52,421
lt's here, l'm coming.

1408
01:50:52,592 --> 01:50:54,184
Who?
- who else? My mummy.

1409
01:50:54,361 --> 01:50:57,091
Mummy?- My soul.

1410
01:51:00,033 --> 01:51:05,437
Till tomorrow morning it will play
with me like a kid playing with ball.

1411
01:51:05,605 --> 01:51:09,097
Why are you getting late?
- Says urgent. Bye...bye...

1412
01:51:09,276 --> 01:51:10,971
What?
- What were you doing there?

1413
01:51:11,144 --> 01:51:13,408
Why were you talking to humans?
- Am l not a human?

1414
01:51:13,580 --> 01:51:14,604
Don't l have a private life?

1415
01:51:14,748 --> 01:51:16,807
You're too much,
you wake me up at 5 am,

1416
01:51:16,984 --> 01:51:18,281
and have drinks up to 3 am,

1417
01:51:18,452 --> 01:51:19,851
l'm dying unable to serve you,

1418
01:51:20,053 --> 01:51:22,146
my health is also deteriorating,
l prefer death than life now.

1419
01:51:22,322 --> 01:51:23,755
Die! Let's roam together.

1420
01:51:24,191 --> 01:51:25,158
Why are you shocked?

1421
01:51:25,325 --> 01:51:27,088
Basha, your drink.

1422
01:51:29,730 --> 01:51:33,427
How could he see you?
- He's also a soul.

1423
01:51:35,602 --> 01:51:37,695
How many are here?
- Roughly about 40 or 50.

1424
01:51:37,838 --> 01:51:39,772
lf you too join, it'll add one more.

1425
01:51:41,608 --> 01:51:44,600
You'll go and sleep happily, right?
- What else you want me to do?

1426
01:51:44,778 --> 01:51:46,211
Come with, let's go to sleep.

1427
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:51,046
What?- l can't come, you go.
Sleep.

1428
01:51:51,218 --> 01:51:52,515
Looks like you both have
become good friends.

1429
01:51:52,686 --> 01:51:56,782
With him? No way.
l'm waiting for an opportunity.

1430
01:51:56,990 --> 01:51:59,254
He'll join you in short time.

1431
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:05,689
lt's me Chari.
- Tell me grandma.

1432
01:52:05,866 --> 01:52:07,891
We are coming to Calcutta.
- Tomorrow?

1433
01:52:08,101 --> 01:52:10,296
Why are you coming here
though it's my birthday?

1434
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:12,665
Have you ever celebrated
birthday without us?

1435
01:52:12,806 --> 01:52:16,242
Why don't you listen to me?
Then do one thing.

1436
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:18,810
After getting down from flight,
come to Kali temple.

1437
01:52:18,945 --> 01:52:20,674
l'll be there hoodwinking these fools.

1438
01:52:20,814 --> 01:52:22,042
What do you say?
- Okay.

1439
01:52:22,215 --> 01:52:23,546
Okay, cut the call.

1440
01:52:25,819 --> 01:52:27,787
Going to Kalighat?

1441
01:52:30,023 --> 01:52:34,585
Tell me.
- Listen carefully.

1442
01:52:39,499 --> 01:52:42,593
lsn't it wonderful?
Hubby, look there!

1443
01:52:42,769 --> 01:52:44,430
How handsome our son is.

1444
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:48,801
Why are you all shocked?
How do l look?

1445
01:52:48,942 --> 01:52:52,309
How you look?
You look just like N.T. Rama Rao!

1446
01:52:52,479 --> 01:52:54,674
Where is my fiancN?
- What's that?

1447
01:52:54,848 --> 01:52:56,042
FiancN means Chandrakala.

1448
01:52:56,216 --> 01:52:58,707
She has a gift for your birthday,
she's waiting outside the temple.

1449
01:52:58,852 --> 01:52:59,910
Outside?

1450
01:53:02,155 --> 01:53:04,123
Why are you sitting here
instead of visiting the temple?

1451
01:53:04,257 --> 01:53:06,191
lt seem you've a gift for me,
what is it?

1452
01:53:08,261 --> 01:53:09,250
Kiss?

1453
01:53:09,496 --> 01:53:11,589
We are Brahmins,
can we behave so cheaply?

1454
01:53:11,765 --> 01:53:14,290
Kiss is not sin.
- ls it? Then kiss me.

1455
01:53:14,468 --> 01:53:16,436
l'm not in mood, come.
- Come.

1456
01:53:20,407 --> 01:53:25,572
That's him! Use your all talent,
even body shouldn't be found.

1457
01:53:25,745 --> 01:53:29,272
l must see happiness in
my brother-in-law's eyes. Got it?

1458
01:53:29,483 --> 01:53:33,112
Okay...no need to stress it.

1459
01:53:33,286 --> 01:53:36,744
Why are you sitting here?
Come, let's circumambulate the temple.

1460
01:53:36,890 --> 01:53:39,188
We were waiting for you.
- Come father.

1461
01:53:51,538 --> 01:53:54,268
Why are you blocking our way,
you donkeys? Move!

1462
01:53:54,708 --> 01:53:56,903
Why is he brandishing a dagger?
- Then l'll run!

1463
01:54:05,318 --> 01:54:07,445
Don't worry, God is there!

1464
01:54:07,921 --> 01:54:09,786
Somebody please save my son.

1465
01:54:21,935 --> 01:54:23,425
ls it Chari or the other one?

1466
01:54:31,344 --> 01:54:32,936
Did you see how he's
beating up them, granny?

1467
01:54:33,146 --> 01:54:36,274
Didn't l tell you about fight in pub?
- Yes...yes...

1468
01:54:41,288 --> 01:54:42,482
How come our boy is beating them?

1469
01:54:42,656 --> 01:54:45,250
ls he eating non-vegetarian food?
- Yes...yes...

1470
01:54:45,525 --> 01:54:46,583
No...no...

1471
01:55:08,481 --> 01:55:13,544
ls he my son or the other boy
who looks like him?

1472
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:15,051
Yes...yes...no...no...

1473
01:55:15,222 --> 01:55:17,782
You're saying yes and no,
tell me yes or no.

1474
01:55:17,958 --> 01:55:20,256
No...no...
- ls he not my son?

1475
01:55:20,427 --> 01:55:22,861
Yes...yes...
- Kill me!

1476
01:55:33,406 --> 01:55:36,068
ls he getting bashed up by our boys?

1477
01:55:36,276 --> 01:55:40,076
No, he's bashing up our boys.
- ls it? May be it's him.

1478
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:41,804
Don't know, l see only one here.

1479
01:55:41,982 --> 01:55:43,074
Situation is very dangerous here.

1480
01:55:43,283 --> 01:55:44,580
Have you paid the goons?

1481
01:55:44,751 --> 01:55:46,810
No, l said payment afterjob is done.

1482
01:55:46,987 --> 01:55:48,978
The escape now, you can save money.

1483
01:55:49,122 --> 01:55:50,248
You said it right.

1484
01:55:55,362 --> 01:55:56,590
My bad time!

1485
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:14,269
Mother!

1486
01:56:30,630 --> 01:56:33,929
Mother, if he's that guy,
then where is my son?

1487
01:56:34,067 --> 01:56:34,931
Grandma!

1488
01:56:37,771 --> 01:56:41,468
Father, it' not me.
He's himself. Let's go.

1489
01:56:41,641 --> 01:56:43,336
Wasn't it you who beat goons in the pub?

1490
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:46,570
What are you saying?
Did you fall in love for the fight?

1491
01:56:46,746 --> 01:56:49,613
Engagement is cancelled, grandma.
- You keep quiet.

1492
01:56:49,783 --> 01:56:52,308
Though he beat them,
l fell in love with you only.

1493
01:56:52,485 --> 01:56:54,783
Then, engagement stands.
Let's go.

1494
01:56:57,924 --> 01:57:00,222
Father, you go back home.

1495
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:01,658
Who are you?

1496
01:57:02,529 --> 01:57:04,929
Why are you acting like me?
Who sent you?

1497
01:57:05,098 --> 01:57:07,498
Will you kill him?

1498
01:57:07,667 --> 01:57:09,692
lf he doesn't tell the truth,
l'll kill him.

1499
01:57:09,869 --> 01:57:12,929
Kill him, kill your own brother.

1500
01:57:14,307 --> 01:57:15,638
What are you saying grandma?

1501
01:57:15,809 --> 01:57:18,175
He's your brother.

1502
01:57:18,378 --> 01:57:23,247
l separated you to save my family.
You both are twins.

1503
01:57:28,388 --> 01:57:34,054
Goddess Kali has united you on your
birthday, the day l separated you both.

1504
01:57:34,194 --> 01:57:35,752
You mean, is he not my son?

1505
01:57:35,929 --> 01:57:38,227
Father, l'm your son only, wait.

1506
01:57:38,431 --> 01:57:41,195
Why are you trapped with them?

1507
01:57:47,807 --> 01:57:50,776
So l talked to your father on phone.

1508
01:57:50,944 --> 01:57:53,242
Not mine but our father.
- Then me?

1509
01:57:53,446 --> 01:57:56,210
Father, you're also my father...wait.

1510
01:57:56,383 --> 01:57:59,944
What shall we do now?
- Not together, l'll do.

1511
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:02,486
Till now they used you in my place,

1512
01:58:02,655 --> 01:58:05,988
l'll take your place and
do what is to be done,

1513
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:07,148
and save our father.

1514
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,487
You'll go missing again,
they will catch me,

1515
01:58:09,662 --> 01:58:10,959
we'll all be trouble.

1516
01:58:11,131 --> 01:58:13,497
Whatever it is, from now
let's do it together.

1517
01:58:13,666 --> 01:58:16,396
Let's use the advantage
look alike personality.

1518
01:58:16,569 --> 01:58:17,866
What do you say father?
You calm down.

1519
01:58:18,037 --> 01:58:19,595
That's the matter.
- Okay.

1520
01:58:20,173 --> 01:58:21,538
Let's go from here.

1521
01:58:22,642 --> 01:58:24,803
What are you saying?
- Yes aunty.

1522
01:58:24,978 --> 01:58:26,912
Your second son too is alive.

1523
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:30,015
They will together bring uncle
to you shortly.

1524
01:58:30,183 --> 01:58:32,117
Separated family will reunite.

1525
01:58:32,252 --> 01:58:36,154
You've give me good news,
what can l give you?

1526
01:58:36,289 --> 01:58:40,919
You've given your son,
what else can be greater than it?

1527
01:58:57,577 --> 01:59:00,774
My eyes see with you only...

1528
01:59:01,881 --> 01:59:05,214
My legs run with you only...

1529
01:59:06,152 --> 01:59:09,610
My lips will kiss you only...

01:59:10,323 --> 01:59:14,692
My heart will beat for you only...

01:59:14,861 --> 01:59:16,658
My imaginations are about you only...

01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:18,798
My story is with you only...

1533
01:59:18,965 --> 01:59:23,664
My day night, joy sorrow

how difficult it may be...

1536
02:00:18,758 --> 02:00:23,388

1538
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,659
My wishes end with you...

1539
02:00:29,836 --> 02:00:31,736
My desires end with you...

1540
02:00:31,905 --> 02:00:37,935
You're my dance, song,
hunt and way...

1541
02:01:06,973 --> 02:01:09,339
How much ever beautiful l may be...

1542
02:01:09,542 --> 02:01:11,635
lf you refuse me, it's nothing...

1543
02:01:11,811 --> 02:01:15,941
My beauty and body is all yours...

1544
02:01:16,115 --> 02:01:18,049
lf your heart doesn't fall in love...

1545
02:01:18,217 --> 02:01:20,185
lt's useless to be youth...

1546
02:01:20,353 --> 02:01:24,255
Evenings are with you only...

1547
02:01:24,424 --> 02:01:26,289
My fun is with you only...

1548
02:01:26,426 --> 02:01:28,587
My pluses are with you only...

1549
02:01:28,761 --> 02:01:34,927
l'm not with me,
l'm with you only...

1550
02:02:08,201 --> 02:02:13,935
Satellite controlled Stealth weapon
you've been waiting for years is ready.

1551
02:02:14,107 --> 02:02:19,477
You know how much risk l took
and invested heavily,

1552
02:02:19,646 --> 02:02:21,136
so if you make your offer.

1553
02:02:23,349 --> 02:02:28,514
You can kill anyone in this world
sitting at home with your laptop.

1554
02:02:37,397 --> 02:02:40,491
Deal is okay on one condition.
- What's the condition?

1555
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:45,194
They want the life of its designer.

1556
02:02:45,371 --> 02:02:49,273
He mustn't design another one.

1557
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:56,210
ln 48 hours, weapon and its
designer will be at your service.

1558
02:02:56,382 --> 02:02:58,543
lt's unjust to kill the Major.

1559
02:02:58,751 --> 02:03:00,776
Don't say it loud, he may kill you.

1560
02:03:05,692 --> 02:03:08,593
What?
- Dhanraj has escaped.

1561
02:03:08,795 --> 02:03:11,992
l'm sure he'll go to Baba.
- Then, we'll be in danger.

1562
02:03:12,165 --> 02:03:14,565
So, follow my plan.
- Tell me.

1563
02:03:30,717 --> 02:03:32,685
please don't shoot me.

1564
02:03:32,852 --> 02:03:35,116
lf anything happens to me,
your father will die.

1565
02:03:35,288 --> 02:03:39,418
Take this gun and kill me.

1566
02:03:40,026 --> 02:03:43,792
Anyway you will kill me on
knowing the truth in few days.

1567
02:03:43,963 --> 02:03:46,056
Kill me now only.
- What's the truth?

1568
02:03:46,232 --> 02:03:50,191
l'm not Major's son Narasimha.

1569
02:03:50,369 --> 02:03:52,997
Trust me, l'm his look alike
Narasimhachari.

1570
02:03:53,172 --> 02:03:55,402
l belong to a Brahmin neighbourhood.

1571
02:03:55,575 --> 02:04:00,444
Meta and Basha lured me
with money to act like him.

1572
02:04:01,881 --> 02:04:04,509
You were worried about
Major stopping the work...

1573
02:04:04,717 --> 02:04:06,446
So l suggested about taking him.

1574
02:04:06,586 --> 02:04:08,747
Though he's duplicate,
yourjob is done, right?

1575
02:04:08,921 --> 02:04:12,618
l came to know that l was
cheating a gentleman.

1576
02:04:12,825 --> 02:04:15,589
Gentleman? Who is he?
- You!

1577
02:04:16,496 --> 02:04:19,761
My grandma always said
never cheat good men.

1578
02:04:19,932 --> 02:04:21,763
That's also me, right?
- Yes, you!

1579
02:04:21,934 --> 02:04:23,026
That's why l told you the truth.

1580
02:04:23,202 --> 02:04:25,227
Forgive me or punish me,
the decision is yours.

1581
02:04:25,404 --> 02:04:26,598
Who else knows this?

1582
02:04:26,806 --> 02:04:30,242
Till now we knew and now you know.

1583
02:04:31,177 --> 02:04:33,441
Look...whatever it may be.

1584
02:04:33,613 --> 02:04:38,448
Till now you acted for them,
now you continue it for me.

1585
02:04:38,618 --> 02:04:42,486
Major must believe that you're
his son till my job is done.

1586
02:04:42,622 --> 02:04:43,452
l'll pay you Rs.1 crore.

1587
02:04:43,623 --> 02:04:45,056
Why? We've already paid him heavily.

1588
02:04:45,224 --> 02:04:48,022
Tell me what you want, we'll train him.
- Get out! - No sir...

1589
02:04:48,194 --> 02:04:49,855
l'll kill you
- l'll go.

1590
02:04:50,029 --> 02:04:53,260
l'm ready to do anything for you.

1591
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:56,896
l'll act like l too don't know
you're not the real man.

1592
02:04:57,069 --> 02:05:00,561
Let it be between us only,
nobody must know it.

1593
02:05:09,015 --> 02:05:12,473
How come you're hurt?
- He did it.

1594
02:05:12,652 --> 02:05:15,644
He kidnapped and tortured me.
- That man?

1595
02:05:15,855 --> 02:05:19,188
Why did that man kidnap you?
- That man? He?

1596
02:05:19,592 --> 02:05:21,492
Yes, he! Why did he kidnap you?

1597
02:05:21,661 --> 02:05:24,926
To know the whereabouts of Major.
- What did you tell him?

1598
02:05:25,097 --> 02:05:29,158
Him? He!
- Yes, he!

1599
02:05:29,335 --> 02:05:30,825
What did you tell?
- Ask him.

1600
02:05:31,003 --> 02:05:32,937
How can he remember?
He's absentminded.

1601
02:05:33,105 --> 02:05:35,471
l forgot everything.
- Look, he remembers that clearly.

1602
02:05:35,608 --> 02:05:38,543
He hasn't forgotten anything,
he's playing a drama.

1603
02:05:38,678 --> 02:05:42,114
Tell me what did you tell him?

1604
02:05:42,281 --> 02:05:45,478
l told him about the island's location.
- Why did you tell him?

1605
02:05:45,618 --> 02:05:49,520
Why? He too threatened
to kill me, so l told him.

1606
02:05:49,689 --> 02:05:52,123
What can he do knowing the place?

1607
02:05:52,291 --> 02:05:56,819
He must know the password
to get Major out.

1608
02:05:56,996 --> 02:05:59,863
l told him bravely because
it's in your laptop.

1609
02:06:00,299 --> 02:06:03,097
Even if goes there,
our men will kill him.

1610
02:06:03,269 --> 02:06:05,464
He's here, how can he go there?

1611
02:06:05,638 --> 02:06:08,698
He said if he goes there,
why are you stretching it?

1612
02:06:08,875 --> 02:06:10,274
Do onething, have drinks and take rest.

1613
02:06:10,443 --> 02:06:13,435
What about him?
He tortured me a lot.

1614
02:06:13,613 --> 02:06:15,205
Look at me!

1615
02:06:17,116 --> 02:06:21,109
Just a sorry for the hell
l had been through.

1616
02:06:21,287 --> 02:06:23,016
No problem, l'll say big sorry!

1617
02:06:25,124 --> 02:06:27,957
Enough.
Look how nicely he says sorry.

1618
02:06:28,127 --> 02:06:30,994
Now go...go.

1619
02:06:37,803 --> 02:06:40,033
l want to tell you truth.
- What is it?

1620
02:06:40,439 --> 02:06:43,738
Narasimha tortured you and
Chari said sorry to you.

1621
02:06:44,377 --> 02:06:48,973
Yes sir. They are two!
- l too feel the same.

1622
02:06:49,148 --> 02:06:51,207
Their slang is different.

1623
02:06:51,384 --> 02:06:52,817
Not just slang, they are different people.

1624
02:06:53,019 --> 02:06:54,816
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

1625
02:06:55,021 --> 02:06:56,613
My mummy told me not to tell this.

1626
02:06:56,756 --> 02:06:59,054
Mummy?
- lt's an epic tale of soul.

1627
02:06:59,225 --> 02:07:02,922
lt has gone out for a stroll,
let's tell Baba before it comes back.

1628
02:07:03,696 --> 02:07:08,759
l've understood everything.
- What have you understood?

1629
02:07:08,935 --> 02:07:10,926
They are two different people.

1630
02:07:11,103 --> 02:07:12,764
How do you know?
- He told me.

1631
02:07:12,972 --> 02:07:16,135
The man who kidnapped is
different from the man who is here.

1632
02:07:16,309 --> 02:07:19,142
You tell him.
- Yes sir, they are two people.

1633
02:07:19,312 --> 02:07:20,210
l'll kill you.

1634
02:07:20,379 --> 02:07:22,711
Two? He's one man! He's here only.

1635
02:07:22,848 --> 02:07:24,179
There's another one who isn't here.

1636
02:07:24,350 --> 02:07:26,250
How can a man be there who isn't?
- He's there sir.

1637
02:07:26,419 --> 02:07:28,410
l came to tell you and
got trapped here.

1638
02:07:28,587 --> 02:07:30,714
So you say, two look alikes are there

1639
02:07:30,856 --> 02:07:32,790
Thank God, you got it at last.

1640
02:07:32,959 --> 02:07:34,984
ls their father same?
- No.

1641
02:07:35,161 --> 02:07:38,096
Same mother?
- No, but same mother tongue.

1642
02:07:38,264 --> 02:07:39,356
l'll pluck out your eyes.

1643
02:07:39,532 --> 02:07:41,432
Fathers and mothers are different,
how can they look same?

1644
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:45,730
They look same.
- l won't believe it.

1645
02:07:45,871 --> 02:07:47,270
You too don't believe it.

1646
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:49,198
Don't believe anything without proof.

1647
02:07:49,375 --> 02:07:52,811
You want proof? Are you ajudge?
You're just a don, that's all.

1648
02:07:53,012 --> 02:07:56,038
Even dons need proofs.
lf you've show me, l'll believe you.

1649
02:07:56,215 --> 02:07:57,614
proofs mean...

1650
02:08:01,053 --> 02:08:02,111
Come...come...

1651
02:08:03,289 --> 02:08:05,849
Entered safely, didn't face
any problem, right?

1652
02:08:06,258 --> 02:08:08,886
Everyone think it's you,
how can l have any trouble?

1653
02:08:09,095 --> 02:08:12,861
Okay, Baba is receiving cash
in an hour,

1654
02:08:13,065 --> 02:08:14,896
he'll open the laptop then.

1655
02:08:15,301 --> 02:08:18,134
We must divert his attention
when he opens it.

1656
02:08:18,304 --> 02:08:20,431
What should l do for it?
- Where is your girl friend?

1657
02:08:20,606 --> 02:08:22,870
She's in Calcutta.
- My girl friend is also here only.

1658
02:08:23,075 --> 02:08:25,600
Why do we need them now?
- l'll tell you.

1659
02:08:28,781 --> 02:08:29,713
Tell me peri Shastri.

1660
02:08:29,849 --> 02:08:31,976
l've an important news for you.

1661
02:08:32,151 --> 02:08:33,311
Can l tell on p[hone or personally?

1662
02:08:33,486 --> 02:08:35,386
lf you come, you'll also get
trapped, tell me on phone.

1663
02:08:35,554 --> 02:08:37,522
They are twins.

1664
02:08:37,790 --> 02:08:39,781
The old woman changed
them in hospital.

1665
02:08:39,992 --> 02:08:42,426
l got information from our spies
in the neighbourhood.

1666
02:08:42,595 --> 02:08:45,860
This proof is enough to finish him.

1667
02:08:46,065 --> 02:08:47,430
You hang up the phone.

1668
02:08:51,704 --> 02:08:52,534
What again?

1669
02:08:52,705 --> 02:08:57,438
Dhanraj and my Guru are spreading
news that we are two people.

1670
02:08:57,610 --> 02:09:02,138
lf this news reaches Major's ears?
You'll lose everything.

1671
02:09:02,314 --> 02:09:05,181
Yes, l'm also feeling
heaviness in chest.

1672
02:09:05,351 --> 02:09:08,912
lf l kill both of them,
people may get wrong ideas.

1673
02:09:09,121 --> 02:09:12,488
lf you want to stop them,
accept that we are two people.

1674
02:09:12,658 --> 02:09:15,126
l'll not accept, how can l bring
the real man now if he asks?

1675
02:09:15,294 --> 02:09:18,195
No need to bring him,
tell him we were twins.

1676
02:09:18,364 --> 02:09:21,265
Tell them grandma separated us at birth.

1677
02:09:21,434 --> 02:09:24,267
Then we'll both be major's children.
Think about it.

1678
02:09:24,804 --> 02:09:27,102
Then it doesn't matter
whether it's you or him here.

1679
02:09:29,642 --> 02:09:33,476
ls he also here?
Good!

1680
02:09:33,646 --> 02:09:36,479
You didn't believe me
when l told they were two.

1681
02:09:36,649 --> 02:09:38,913
But they are...
- Two!

1682
02:09:39,652 --> 02:09:40,846
You too know it?

1683
02:09:40,986 --> 02:09:44,854
You need to know one more thing.
They are twins.

1684
02:09:45,191 --> 02:09:47,352
Grandma separated them at birth.

1685
02:09:47,526 --> 02:09:49,858
...Hospital!
- Some hospital!

1686
02:09:49,995 --> 02:09:52,725
So their fathers and mothers are same.

1687
02:09:52,865 --> 02:09:54,162
Both are Major's sons.

1688
02:09:54,333 --> 02:09:55,766
What's the difference
if he's here or the other one?

1689
02:09:56,969 --> 02:09:58,869
Come...come.

1690
02:10:02,641 --> 02:10:06,270
l've a doubt, is Baba real?

1691
02:10:06,445 --> 02:10:09,278
Don't raise new tensions, come.
- Come.

1692
02:10:20,493 --> 02:10:22,222
50% money has reached my account.

1693
02:10:22,394 --> 02:10:24,419
Your good time has started again.

1694
02:10:25,097 --> 02:10:26,792
Looks like new trouble is here.

1695
02:10:26,966 --> 02:10:30,367
How could you come in? Go out.
- Call Narsi. Call!

1696
02:10:30,536 --> 02:10:32,265
What's this nuisance?

1697
02:10:32,438 --> 02:10:34,030
How are you Narsi?
- Who are you?

1698
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:36,367
Have you forgotten me?
l'm Nandu.

1699
02:10:36,542 --> 02:10:38,908
Have they charmed you?
- What's that nonsense?

1700
02:10:39,044 --> 02:10:42,605
We never drink.
- He'll get caught now.

1701
02:10:43,816 --> 02:10:46,284
You couldn't do anything,
so watch now.

1702
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:50,120
Who are you?
- What bothers you? Who are you?

1703
02:10:50,623 --> 02:10:53,922
Why are you here? What's this Narsi?
- Hands off him.

1704
02:10:56,929 --> 02:10:59,659
l'll put hands or legs on my boy friend,
who are you to stop me?

1705
02:10:59,832 --> 02:11:02,767
Boy friend?
He's my fiancN.

1706
02:11:02,935 --> 02:11:03,799
l'll kill you.

1707
02:11:03,936 --> 02:11:05,597
How dare you call my
boy friend as your husband.

1708
02:11:05,771 --> 02:11:08,672
Don't talk too much,
l'll break your teeth.

1709
02:11:08,841 --> 02:11:09,933
Shut up!
- Shut up!

1710
02:11:10,075 --> 02:11:11,702
What are you blabbering?
- What are you blabbering?

1711
02:11:11,877 --> 02:11:12,536
Shut up!

1712
02:11:13,612 --> 02:11:16,843
Don't create a scene here,
don't fight without knowing the truth.

1713
02:11:17,016 --> 02:11:18,005
What's the truth?

1714
02:11:20,085 --> 02:11:24,249
Come here.- Me?
- Yes, come here. Come.

1715
02:11:25,024 --> 02:11:25,581
What sir?

1716
02:11:25,758 --> 02:11:28,955
Till now you were telling me
a tale, tell them now.

1717
02:11:30,763 --> 02:11:34,927
l can't look into her eyes and speak.
l love her.

1718
02:11:35,868 --> 02:11:37,802
Yes.
Would you like to hear that story?

1719
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:41,565
l'll kill you right now.
l don't want your love tale.

1720
02:11:41,740 --> 02:11:43,264
Tell them the story of twins.

1721
02:11:43,442 --> 02:11:44,534
Tell them!

1722
02:11:45,244 --> 02:11:47,439
Chandu, what really had happened was...

1723
02:12:12,238 --> 02:12:13,466
That's what had happened!

1724
02:12:13,639 --> 02:12:15,470
After we get him,
we'll send both of them.

1725
02:12:15,641 --> 02:12:16,767
You go now.

1726
02:12:20,512 --> 02:12:22,707
Nobody can go out after
knowing the story.

1727
02:12:22,881 --> 02:12:26,612
Those who know should be here only?
- That's all.

1728
02:12:26,785 --> 02:12:29,549
There's a party today evening, enjoy it.

1729
02:12:34,093 --> 02:12:36,926
My heart is agitated like mixie...

1730
02:12:45,104 --> 02:12:47,163
You're cool like chilled pepsi...

1731
02:12:47,373 --> 02:12:49,432
Your lips are like roses...

1732
02:12:49,608 --> 02:12:51,701
Your waist is like jasmine twig...

1733
02:12:51,877 --> 02:12:54,607
He's one man to others but for me two!

1734
02:13:12,531 --> 02:13:13,429
Shattering!

1735
02:13:21,707 --> 02:13:26,770
Salutations...salutations...
my heart races on seeing you...

1736
02:13:30,582 --> 02:13:35,884
Salutations...salutations...
when a tiger is pouncing on me...

1737
02:13:51,236 --> 02:13:53,363
You're my taxi to the dreamland...

1738
02:13:53,539 --> 02:13:56,235
Be my lifelong partner...

1739
02:14:38,884 --> 02:14:43,912
My mind blocked watching
you part by part...

1740
02:14:44,089 --> 02:14:48,219
Your eyes are never ending
streams of desire...

1741
02:14:48,727 --> 02:14:53,096
Don't enchant me with
your sweet talk...

1742
02:14:53,232 --> 02:14:57,430
lf l get into mood,
l'll kiss you hundred times...

1743
02:14:57,603 --> 02:14:59,730
Your eyes are razor sharp...

1744
02:14:59,905 --> 02:15:02,100
Your vision is prickly...

1745
02:15:02,241 --> 02:15:04,766
Your bow like body...

1746
02:15:06,779 --> 02:15:08,838
Your words are rhythms of violin...

1747
02:15:09,014 --> 02:15:11,107
Your vision is electrifying...

1748
02:15:11,250 --> 02:15:13,946
Your touch is thundering...

1749
02:16:15,614 --> 02:16:19,948
Your hot waist has a cute twist...

1750
02:16:20,118 --> 02:16:24,487
Like a rainbow in dark, it struck me...

1751
02:16:24,656 --> 02:16:29,093
Man's ultimate power is
in majestic moustache...

1752
02:16:29,261 --> 02:16:33,391
lt's pulling me into the
runway of colourful love...

1753
02:16:33,599 --> 02:16:35,692
Your sugary lips...

1754
02:16:35,868 --> 02:16:37,927
Your rocking waist...

1755
02:16:38,103 --> 02:16:40,594
Your outfit's hooks...

1756
02:16:42,674 --> 02:16:44,835
Your face...

1757
02:16:45,010 --> 02:16:47,103
Your craze...

1758
02:16:47,279 --> 02:16:49,941
Your knock-out punch...

1759
02:17:38,997 --> 02:17:40,760
Father...father...

1760
02:17:45,537 --> 02:17:47,266
poor boy! Got locked up?

1761
02:17:47,706 --> 02:17:51,164
l shifted your father for safety.
lt helped me.

1762
02:17:51,343 --> 02:17:54,540
lnformation to you.
l'm going to kill your father tomorrow.

1763
02:17:55,347 --> 02:17:59,147
l don't need that island anymore,
the doors will never open again.

1764
02:17:59,318 --> 02:18:03,118
You'll die inside without
food and water.

1765
02:18:06,291 --> 02:18:08,851
We must go out quickly.

1766
02:18:12,431 --> 02:18:15,832
Where are you going, Chari?
- Where will l go?

1767
02:18:16,001 --> 02:18:18,367
These girls want a tour of the city.

1768
02:18:18,570 --> 02:18:21,630
You'll go to see the city,
your brother has gone to see island.

1769
02:18:21,807 --> 02:18:23,001
What should l see then?

1770
02:18:23,442 --> 02:18:25,273
Your father will die.

1771
02:18:25,677 --> 02:18:28,510
Stand like this when your
father comes tomorrow.

1772
02:19:06,385 --> 02:19:08,046
You fix the target.

1773
02:19:14,359 --> 02:19:20,992
Our target is on the bridge
which is 12 kms away from here.

1774
02:19:36,248 --> 02:19:37,772
lt's right before your eyes.

1775
02:19:45,957 --> 02:19:47,891
Show them!

1776
02:20:21,560 --> 02:20:24,393
Sorry Major! l settled the
deal with your life.

1777
02:20:24,563 --> 02:20:25,552
l couldn't avoid it.

1778
02:20:51,890 --> 02:20:52,822
How could he come out?

1779
02:20:52,991 --> 02:20:56,085
The way he went inside,
the same way he came out.

1780
02:20:56,261 --> 02:20:58,252
That's logic!

1781
02:22:01,726 --> 02:22:03,956
No...no...weapon will get destroyed.

1782
02:22:04,129 --> 02:22:06,427
l'll send back your people, take them.

1783
02:22:07,065 --> 02:22:08,589
Go...go away.

1784
02:22:10,836 --> 02:22:13,361
How come they are two?
- Both are your sons, twins.

1785
02:22:13,538 --> 02:22:16,098
The will tell you the story later.
Go...go...

1786
02:22:16,274 --> 02:22:19,266
Don't fire, we'll get burnt.

1787
02:22:29,754 --> 02:22:33,121
lt will not work, he left the
machine but took the trigger.

1788
02:22:34,226 --> 02:22:35,591
Return the trigger.

1789
02:22:36,695 --> 02:22:39,721
l'll give it to my son,
if you've guts take it form him.

1790
02:23:15,233 --> 02:23:18,430
Fools are always fighting!
When will they reform?

1791
02:23:19,137 --> 02:23:21,935
Killing a Brahmin is sin,
you'll lose the other leg also.

1792
02:23:22,474 --> 02:23:24,442
He doesn't care about sins.

1793
02:23:31,116 --> 02:23:36,281
lf you're alive, friendship would
lose it' meaning.

1794
02:24:57,435 --> 02:24:58,265
Hubby!

1795
02:24:59,838 --> 02:25:02,966
Who is she?
- Your mother.

1796
02:25:03,141 --> 02:25:05,871
l had to introduce to your family.

1797
02:27:13,438 --> 02:27:16,737
please don't cry children.

1798
02:27:16,908 --> 02:27:20,002
We are going to watch a film,
take care of the children.

1799
02:27:20,211 --> 02:27:23,271
Okay.- Bye Bhattu!
- Okay Chandu.

1800
02:27:24,449 --> 02:27:26,974
l should've married your mummy,

1801
02:27:27,152 --> 02:27:29,382
l got caught with a mummy
and my life turned into hell.

1802
02:27:29,721 --> 02:27:33,020
My glass is empty!
- Drink my blood.

1803
02:27:33,224 --> 02:27:35,590
lf you go on drink, it will get over.

1804
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:38,058
l'm dying unable to take care of you.

1805
02:27:38,263 --> 02:27:41,289
l'm working for them,
how much can l get for how long?

1806
02:27:41,466 --> 02:27:44,264
From shop!
- From shop?

1807
02:27:44,869 --> 02:27:49,932
people have cat or dog as pets,
but my pet is a soul.
