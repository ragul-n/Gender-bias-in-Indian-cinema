1
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,540
Remember, Kanak Sharma is a
candidate backed by Radhe Bhaiyya!

2
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,207
we must elect Radhe Bhaiyya's candidate...

3
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,540
as the general secretary of
our union once again this year

4
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,874
Here are the benefits if
Radhe Bhaiyya's candidate wins

5
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:12,957
You can go watch a movie and your
attendance will still be recorded

6
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,874
You can carry notes to cheat in the exams

7
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,249
No action will be taken for winking at pretty girls

8
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,874
The famous dance party from Delhi has already arrived...

9
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,124
all arrangements for the celebration are in place

10
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:27,540
we're only waiting for the results to be declared

11
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,540
l've spent so much in this election

12
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:36,540
lf l lose this election, l'll have to commit suicide

13
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,790
Hey, Hemant bhaiyya...
why will you commit suicide?

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,874
lt's Kanak Sharma who's going to die.
l'll murder the bastard

15
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,124
Are you out of your mind?
why do you keep talking nonsense?

16
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,957
Alex has told me.
l'll bump off the bastard

17
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,040
Tiwari, skip the blah-blah

18
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,540
You aren't supposed to think aloud

19
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,540
Radhe!

20
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,874
"Sweetheart..."

21
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,707
"sweetheart..."

22
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:19,207
"my heart says, sweetheart..."

23
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,874
"come and meet me..."

24
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,540
"don't ever go far away from me"

25
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,207
"No, no, no..."

26
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,790
"l'm not falling in love..."

27
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,207
"don't steal my heart..."

28
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,915
"don't get closer to me"

29
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:31,540
"Look, let me tell you..."

30
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:37,540
"in love, when you say no, it means yes"

31
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:49,999
"Pretty girls' excuses are ages old,
no one has ever figured them out"

32
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,874
"They won't say a word,
their eyes do the talking..."

33
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,540
"and they steal our hearts"

34
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:43,540
"You'd better admit it..."

35
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:49,207
"those who fall in love, shed tears"

36
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,540
"Some gain, some lose, some smile, some cry..."

37
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,957
"some awake, some sleep every moment"

38
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,707
"lt stokes the fires, it causes you to pine..."

39
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,540
"it torments you so"

40
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,540
"No, no, no..."

41
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,290
"Sweetheart..."

42
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,915
"my heart says, sweetheart..."

43
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,540
"come and meet me..."

44
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,874
"don't ever go far away from me"

45
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,540
"The first breeze of dawn, awakens the world..."

46
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:22,124
"the bees have started to hum..."

47
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,957
"the birds take to their wings..."

48
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,207
"colourful decorations mark every courtyard"

49
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,957
"For blessings..."

50
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,540
"for fulfillment..."

51
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:43,540
"at Your feet, Radha offers flowers, O Krishna"

52
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:48,874
"You are the one in my heart..."

53
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,082
"O Krishna..."

54
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,874
"The colourful Krishna"

55
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,124
"l'm crazed in love, l have lost my senses..."

56
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,915
"You are the one l am devoted to"

57
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,207
"At Your doorstep, all day and night..."

58
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,874
"it's Your name l always chant"

59
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,290
"whatever l possess, is Yours..."

60
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,957
"to You, l dedicate my life"

61
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:47,124
"at Your feet, Radha offers flowers, O Krishna"

62
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:52,540
"You are the one in my heart..."

63
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,540
"O Krishna..."

64
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,624
The sound of your daughter's
melodious voice every morning...

65
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,124
erases all our worries

66
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,874
You finished your 12th.
what have you planned to do next, my child?

67
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,957
She's going to attend college now.
- what will she gain in college?

68
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,540
She's going to be married after all

69
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:22,082
My son-in-law to-be has expressed
the wish that she studies further

70
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,707
l see. ls that true, Rameshwar?

71
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,290
Yes, Uncle. All l could learn at
the tutelage was the Vedas

72
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,874
At least she must be a graduate

73
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,124
So you want a wife who speaks English!

74
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,540
But you know how things
are at the college, don't you?

75
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,957
Kids in Agra study less and watch movies more

76
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,957
Nirjara is not like that.
And she has lndu for company

77
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,957
She'll take the 7:35 a.m.
Frontier Mail every morning

78
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,540
The college is near the station.
As soon as her classes are over...

79
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,540
she'll take the 16:35 express train back

80
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,207
"Away from a world of hatred..."

81
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:03,124
"in a world of love..."

82
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:07,207
"may you find happiness, my friend..."

83
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,790
"when animals kill man..."

84
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:19,957
"everyone reacts"

85
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:27,874
"And now man has slain an animal..."

86
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,540
"why is the world quiet?"

87
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,540
"Give me that pickle"

88
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,957
l'm told there was a furore yesterday.
You got into a fight at the college

89
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,290
Fight? No, brother.
l broke their legs

90
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,957
lf l had not got there on time,
Alex's men would have killed Kanak

91
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,040
why do you need to interfere
in someone else's affairs?

92
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:56,707
He's a friend. would l remain silent,
if someone came to beat you up?

93
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,874
Besides, it's my college

94
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,957
lt was! How many years is it
since you passed out of college?

95
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,124
But you still hang out there.
For no rhyme or reason

96
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,957
will you spend the life of a vagabond
or find some work to do?

97
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,540
Enough. Let him have the breakfast in peace

98
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,082
Give me a puri, sister-in-law.
- why one? Help yourself to 50

99
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,540
Feed him the free food and make
a stronger bull out of him

100
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,957
So he can keep attacking everyone!

101
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:31,124
Here's your puri,
your bread... and your milk

102
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,540
Don't waste the food

103
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,540
Radhe...
- No

104
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,124
Listen, Radhe...
- No, sister-in-law

105
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,957
See that? You made him get up
while he was eating!

106
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:52,207
The skies haven't fallen.
You're the one who has spoilt him

107
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,124
He goes around with that horrible hair of his...

108
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,874
and makes a few others hang out with him too

109
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,790
l don't know what he's going to do in life

110
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,957
Radhe's an old student of the college

111
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,040
He rags the new students with his friends

112
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,540
Don't look at them!
just keep walking

113
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,874
Look, Radhe.
There's a fresher with lndu

114
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,207
Listen

115
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,040
Come here

116
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,040
Not you. Go to your class and
get on with your studies

117
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,540
First year?

118
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,790
B.A. pass course

119
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,665
Can't you say good morning to your seniors?

120
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,207
Not like that.
Say it like an attentive soldier

121
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,207
Keep saluting me like that
every time you pass by

122
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,540
All right.
- what's that?

123
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,874
And what's this?
- A peacock feather

124
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,207
l can see that.
But why have you kept it in a book?

125
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,207
Kept in a notebook, it doubles

126
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,540
Must be laying eggs!

127
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,957
what's in the box?

128
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,874
wow! Puri and a vegetable dish

129
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,540
Nice

130
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,624
No, don't wipe your hands on my shirt!

131
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,124
what are you doing, Radhe!

132
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,249
Don't wipe it with that.
lt'll be a sin

133
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,207
what's your name?

134
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,957
Nirjara

135
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,540
Meaning?
- Meaning? lt's my name

136
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,874
lt's very a difficult name.
So l asked for the meaning

137
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,207
l don't know

138
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,040
who named you?
- My mother did

139
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,790
So ask your mother.
- She's dead

140
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,957
ls your father alive?
- Yes

141
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,915
So ask him when you come tomorrow

142
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,249
All right

143
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,249
Thanks.

144
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,790
You saved me from sinning

145
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,124
The lunch-box

146
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:32,540
when that peacock feather doubles,
give me one!

147
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:49,540
Father, why did Ma name me Nirjara?

148
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,540
Because your mother loved my mother

149
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,957
Your grandma.
Her name was Nirjara Devi too

150
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,540
what does it mean, father?

151
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,540
why do you need to know today?

152
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:10,540
Tell me, father. Everybody asks me.
They even tease me

153
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,957
Nirjara means...

154
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,540
Money?

155
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,874
Here you are

156
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,207
Chandu...
give her a cup of tea

157
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,124
Very well, Radhe bhaiyya

158
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,165
Nut!

159
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,874
Have patience.
l'm giving it to you

160
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,874
Leave that alone.
what are you doing?

161
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,874
Here you are...

162
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,124
stop bothering me

163
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,874
Forgive me,
Radhe! lt was a mistake!

164
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:15,874
l'll never tease a girl again!
l beg at your feet

165
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,124
Please forgive me... just once!

166
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,624
Drink

167
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,207
Drink it up. Go on

168
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,874
Binti, if you're going upstairs,
wake up your uncle

169
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,124
Let him sleep, Papa.
Today's a Sunday

170
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,540
Today's his birthday, silly!
- Birthday!

171
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,540
wake him up quickly.
we'll get ready and go to Brindavan for prayers

172
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,707
How much money, mister?
- No, sir...

173
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,874
how can we take any money from Radhe bhaiyya?

174
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,124
Hello, Radhe bhaiyya!

175
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,290
See your brother-in-law's reputation?

176
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,207
The flower seller won't take money from him!

177
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,124
People salute him out of fear.
- They respect me...

178
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,124
and you don't like that either.
- Now look. These things...

179
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,540
Do you want me to go away?
- How will you go away?

180
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,124
You're an amazing man!
lt's Radhe's birthday today

181
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:33,749
At least stop taunting him today.
Come, let's go

182
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:40,540
"O Revered Guru..."

183
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:48,124
"deign to bless me"

184
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:58,540
"Grant unto me knowledge and education"

185
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,207
My child, make some porridge.
Rameshwar likes it

186
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,540
Very well, father

187
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,540
ln whose name is the offering to be made?

188
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,624
ln the name of Radhe Mohan

189
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,040
Excuse me...

190
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,707
please come here

191
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,790
Hello.
- Hello

192
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,540
So you are the priest's daughter?

193
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,082
Yes, we are Brahmins

194
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:15,124
My father says, our forefathers used
to be priests in this very temple

195
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,957
l know nothing about my forefathers.
what l do know is that...

196
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,957
my great grandfather used to play
hockey for the English team

197
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,540
My grandfather played hockey with
Gyanchand and Dhyanchand

198
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:31,915
ln extras, too. My father broke his thumb
while playing football

199
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,124
So he took to selling hockey sticks

200
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,874
ls that why you beat everyone with hockey sticks?

201
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,540
what?
- what happened?

202
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,082
Something in my eye

203
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,874
Here... give it some heat

204
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,874
You found out what your name means?
- Yes

205
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,540
what is it?
- Nirjara

206
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:06,207
"jar" means death.
So Nirjara means lmmortality

207
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,790
There's a religious interpretation too

208
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:14,040
One's soul is tied to his deeds

209
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:19,124
Deep meditation frees the soul.
And that is called Nirjara

210
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,957
Here you are.
- what's that?

211
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,874
Gujia (a snack)

212
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,540
Got a few more?
- Yes

213
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,540
For my niece

214
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,540
where did you buy it?
- Not bought it. l myself made it

215
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,124
Both are nice

216
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,707
The Gujia and your name too

217
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,540
Your name is nice too

218
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,124
Radhe Mohan is another name for Lord Krishna.
You know that?

219
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,624
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen!

220
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,124
She first said "ras" (juice)

221
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,540
She then said "gul" (rose)

222
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,749
And then she said "le" (take)

223
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:17,874
Listen, ras, gul and le...

224
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:22,124
that's how she broke up the rasgollah !

225
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,290
Thank you very much

226
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,957
Here comes a doll all covered from top to toe

227
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,957
She's now going to bore us to death with a poem

228
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,124
Clear your throat!

229
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:59,790
"Stars are nothing but the Sun of the night"

230
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,624
"Like the west is also East"

231
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,874
we get that! So what happens next?

232
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,540
Go on, Nirjara

233
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,207
They won't let me speak

234
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:20,957
North in South, East in west...
so what's new?

235
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:41,540
l've taken the trouble of coming to the stage...

236
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,999
because l've liked her poem very much

237
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:51,040
And since l have liked it,
you will like it too. Get that?

238
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:55,124
Those who understand will quietly listen to the recital...

239
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:59,124
and those who don't,
will still sit quietly and listen

240
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,874
Everything's under control.
Please come

241
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,540
Clap for her

242
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:14,082
"Stars are nothing but the Suns of the night"

243
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:17,124
"Like the west is also the East"

244
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:20,082
"The Earth is the daughter of the Sun..."

245
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:22,540
"suspended on a bed in the skies"

246
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,874
"The Sun is an eye-full of light..."

247
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,540
"spread everywhere around"

248
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,874
"where are my..."

249
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:55,540
Radhe-ji... my recital is over

250
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:47,082
"How l love meeting you,
and talking to you"

251
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,624
"what's all this about and why...
l don't know"

252
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:56,040
"But whatever it is..."

253
00:28:56,791 --> 00:29:00,540
"l love it"

254
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:09,540
"How l love meeting you,
and talking to you"

255
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,540
"what's all this about and why...
l don't know"

256
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:18,207
"But whatever it is..."

257
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:22,874
"l love it"

258
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:58,249
"Little things about you,
every meeting we have..."

259
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:02,957
"they torment me,
when you're not with me"

260
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,540
"what's all this about and why...
l don't know"

261
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,874
"But whatever it is..."

262
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:19,540
"l love it"

263
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:07,540
"You give a fragrance to my days and nights..."

264
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:12,540
"yours is the name etched on my heart"

265
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,540
"what's all this about and why...
l don't know"

266
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,540
"But whatever it is..."

267
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,165
"l love it"

268
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:38,124
"How l love meeting you,
and talking to you"

269
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,457
Radhe...?
- Yes, sis-in-law?

270
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,290
what are you doing here
at this hour of the night?

271
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,749
l couldn't go to sleep.
So l thought l'd read a book

272
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,707
why do you need a book
so late in the night?

273
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:09,624
Say something!

274
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,290
Funny!

275
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:14,249
Stop here

276
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:18,332
Sister...

277
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,374
haven't your husband and Rahul come?

278
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,915
This is the limit

279
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:35,540
How can he separate a child from his mother,
for the sake of money?

280
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:40,915
God! Atmaram used to make demands of
20 and 30,000 rupees earlier

281
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,999
He's asking for 200,000 now

282
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,374
Remaining silent will not do, Guruji

283
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,999
we'll have to do something about it

284
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:54,374
There's no need to do anything.
l don't want to live with that man

285
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:59,540
l'll find some work here...
l'll help you in your work

286
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:03,915
l'll raise the money in a few days
and bring back my Rahul

287
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,915
My son must be so harassed

288
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,749
Gardener...

289
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,249
ls this 7\32 ?

290
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,415
Yes, it is. So?

291
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:26,415
l want to meet the one stays here.
- l'm the one. Go on

292
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:29,332
Not you.
we wish to see Radhe Sir

293
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:33,415
what for?
- we'll tell him that

294
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:36,082
just go and tell him that
there's someone here to see him

295
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,499
All right

296
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,874
Sit down inside.
l'll call him

297
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:41,790
who's it?

298
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,999
Are my pants all right?

299
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,999
Go on

300
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,749
So what brings you here?
- Actually...

301
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:13,457
what's her name?
- lndu

302
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,832
lndu-ji, will you please let her speak?
Go on

303
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,332
Actually...
- Say nothing

304
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:23,457
First tell me what you will have,
Tea, coffee, a cold-drink?

305
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,499
Samosas, biscuits...?
- Nothing

306
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:29,832
lmpossible. This is the first time
you've come to my house. Have something

307
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,499
Aslam...
- Yes?

308
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,290
Get some Diet Coke and samosas from Balwant

309
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,165
He makes excellent samosas.
And listen...

310
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,832
give me a cigarette.
Mine are over

311
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,999
Here you are.
- Come back soon

312
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,290
Aslam... come here

313
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,040
Yes, brother?
- who are they?

314
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,207
They study in our college
- l see

315
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,415
Sir, we have a problem

316
00:34:56,916 --> 00:35:02,165
The exams start tomorrow and Nirjara is very upset

317
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:05,165
why? Hasn't she been studying?

318
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,207
No, actually...
- She has lost her admission card

319
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:12,915
l had kept it in my book.
lt has gone missing

320
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:16,832
So?
- A notice on the college board says...

321
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,457
they won't allow us to appear
for the exams without the card

322
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,832
You have come to me with such a small problem?

323
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:32,499
Know what? we'll tear out the notice board
and throw it away

324
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,457
when the notice board is thrown away,
you can appear for the exams

325
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,999
Can't we request the Principal?

326
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:45,832
Actually, Nirjara...
l don't make requests

327
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:49,832
what l say once is the final call

328
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,832
Piping hot samosas!

329
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,332
Keep it here

330
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,832
Have a diet coke

331
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,832
Here you are

332
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,832
Have some samosas

333
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,999
For you

334
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:16,832
Have the samosas and coke...
and leave the tension to me

335
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,332
For you

336
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,832
ls there anything else l can send,
Radhe Sir?

337
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:32,499
No thanks. Everything's here.
l don't need anything

338
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,832
Not even you

339
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:36,832
Catch

340
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,415
The phone won't ring ever

341
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:48,499
People raise a loan to either
buy a house or for education

342
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,290
But you write the reason as...

343
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,999
l want to pay the money to my in-laws
and bring my son back

344
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:59,499
You haven't written anything in the
column meant for sureties?

345
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:03,499
lf l had something to mortgage,
why would l come here for a loan?

346
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:07,124
we need some guarantee that
you will repay the loan

347
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,832
You mean honesty has no value at all?

348
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:13,457
ln that case, give me your honesty.
l'll create a charge on it, okay?

349
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:17,540
well? where is your honesty?
- what things are you saying to me?

350
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:20,832
l don't want any loan from you.
Thank you!

351
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:23,374
l'll find many who'll give me a loan

352
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,124
My exams went off well.
But l'm a bit scared

353
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,457
Don't be scared.
God will take care of everything

354
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,499
How did your exams go?
- Very well

355
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:48,457
lf you want your marks increased let me know.
l can get it down

356
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:51,832
Oh yes, certainly

357
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,832
Let her talk to me

358
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,457
well, thank you

359
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:15,499
well, Radhe...?
She was profusely thanking you. what's up?

360
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:20,832
She lost her identity card and sought my help
to appear for the exams

361
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,332
That's very careless of her! Hey girl...

362
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:29,457
Forget it. She's a decent girl.
- Decent girl means a lovable girl

363
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,165
which means an innocent girl.
- which means a good girl

364
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,999
The gentleman appears to have changed

365
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:39,165
what do you mean by a good girl?
- She sings well

366
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:43,124
when did she sing for you?
- She was singing hymns in the temple

367
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:46,499
His grandma and mine also sing nice hymns...

368
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,832
but you never went to the temple to listen to them

369
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:52,332
My brother and sister-in-law dragged me there

370
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,832
So she sings nice hymns.
Can't be anything else

371
00:38:57,541 --> 00:39:02,290
well... what's that called? Gujia.
She makes nice gujias

372
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:05,165
So you had the Gujias too?
- Yes

373
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:08,540
why are you eyes so red?

374
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,832
l couldn't sleep all night.
- Sleep is lost, peace is lost

375
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:20,832
Do you at least feel hungry?
- Radhe bhaiyya's a gone case!

376
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,582
He's fallen in love with her!

377
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,499
Look at his face!
lsn't he blushing!

378
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,832
Don't talk nonsense!

379
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,915
Aslam, Radhe appears to have changed nowadays

380
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,749
Love is spoiling him rotten, sister-in-law

381
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:46,124
what? Are you speaking the truth?

382
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,124
Don't you know?

383
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,457
lt's the girl who came to your house the other day

384
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,540
The one l brought the samosas and the diet coke for

385
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:56,582
Oh yes, l guessed something was fishy

386
00:39:57,125 --> 00:40:00,624
You know the priest, who keeps ringing the bell
without any clothes on?

387
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:03,707
She's his daughter.
- Must you talk like that about elders?

388
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,457
why not?
He's going to be related to you, isn't he?

389
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,290
Rascal

390
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,499
Sister-in-law,
give me a thousand rupees

391
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:17,124
At once

392
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,749
Here, have a laddoo

393
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,290
l have a sweet-heart.
l don't need laddoos

394
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:25,624
You need them badly,
go ahead and eat it

395
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:28,707
Here you are.
- what's this? l need only 1000 rupees

396
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:32,124
Keep it. You might need it.
- why a couple of thousands?

397
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,457
Stuff five or ten thousand in his pocket

398
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:38,457
lt isn't from the money you give me.
lt's from my savings, keep it

399
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,790
Let's go, Aslam

400
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,874
why did you have to give that
good-for-nothing anymore money?

401
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,457
why do you want to spoil him even more?

402
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:53,665
wrong! lt's time for our Radhe to turn a new leaf

403
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,332
Really? Did you hear that in a
divine announcement?

404
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:58,499
He has fallen in love

405
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,790
what? Fallen in love?
- Yes

406
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:04,874
Radhe's in love?
- Yes

407
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:06,999
l wonder which girl has been
struck by misfortune!

408
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:10,415
Don't say such inauspicious things.
You didn't ask me who the girl is

409
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:12,624
As if you won't tell unless l ask

410
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:16,790
lt's the one we met at the temple.
She sang in such a sweet voice

411
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:20,290
"lt's the priest's daughter who
even came to our house"

412
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:25,290
Oh yes...
- She reminds me of my sister...

413
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,624
who's no more.
- There she goes again

414
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,874
The same features,
the same smile and laughter

415
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:36,457
Hurry up, move it

416
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:39,290
Move it!

417
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:44,457
Hey glasses... aren't you satisfied topping
for three years? Get up

418
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,457
This one's old enough to be a mother
and she's still studying

419
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,624
watch it, Aslam. She's a lecturer!
- Lecturer?

420
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,790
Madam, will you please go out?

421
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,832
Have you eaten?
- Yes

422
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,832
My friends have been ribbing me of late

423
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:28,832
They say, my love story's all set, all fixed up.
But l told them...

424
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:38,332
lt's another matter that l've changed
a bit over the last week or two

425
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:43,165
l'm beginning to feel a sense of responsibility

426
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:48,457
l'm thinking of taking up a nice job

427
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:53,957
ln a beer bar, you know.
The job of a bouncer or a bodyguard

428
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:57,290
l don't get a word of what you're saying

429
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:02,832
That's exactly what l love about you.
You don't get anything at all

430
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,832
All right, l'll explain

431
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:12,332
Now look at this and this... carefully

432
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:18,165
what happened? A clap, right?

433
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:23,165
lt happened when this hand and
this hand came close together

434
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:28,165
You're one hand, l'm the other

435
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:30,457
we ought to meet like that

436
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:32,832
Radhe's using philosophy to reason with her

437
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:40,832
You must be wondering whether
my folks will accept you, isn't it?

438
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,249
But you needn't worry.
They are very orthodox, no doubt

439
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,374
But if l don't eat for a day or two,
everything will be all right

440
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,249
lf your father creates any trouble,
right under his ear, on the neck...

441
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:56,457
l'll give him a tight slap

442
00:43:57,375 --> 00:44:00,832
Fifteen days after our marriage,
he won't know where he is

443
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:28,499
You heard what l said?
That's full and final

444
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:31,165
Yes

445
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:36,290
That...

446
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:43,165
"O ascetic..."

447
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:55,832
"l've fallen in love with you"

448
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:05,457
"l've fallen in love"

449
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:10,249
"My eyes yearn to see your face"

450
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:21,165
"My eyes yearn to see you,
l shed tears when l miss you..."

451
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,499
"on my lips, is your name..."

452
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:25,624
"in my breath, is your name..."

453
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:28,457
"my heart... oh l've lost my heart"

454
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:34,457
"l've fallen in love with you"

455
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:17,832
"O hermit..."

456
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:23,290
"Like a lotus blossoming in moonlight..."

457
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:28,332
"is your lovely face, my love"

458
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:48,165
"Like a couplet penned in simplicity..."

459
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:52,207
"is your lovely face, my love"

460
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:58,165
"My eyes yearn to see you,
l shed tears when l miss you..."

461
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:00,499
"on my lips, is your name..."

462
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:02,832
"in my breath, is your name..."

463
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,499
"my heart... oh l've lost my heart"

464
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:11,624
"l've fallen in love with you"

465
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:51,207
"Appear in my dreams,
live in my heart..."

466
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,832
"show me a glimpse of
your beautiful face, my love"

467
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,832
"without you, my heart won't be
placated anymore..."

468
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:05,165
"come to me and don't go away ever"

469
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:11,249
"My eyes yearn to see you,
l shed tears when l miss you..."

470
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:13,499
"on my lips, is your name..."

471
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,582
"in my breath, is your name..."

472
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:18,165
"my heart... oh l've lost my heart"

473
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:24,499
"l've fallen in love with you"

474
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:34,124
"l've fallen in love"

475
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,290
You've come to the canteen after ages...

476
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:44,165
and you're smiling to yourself?
what's the matter?

477
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:47,165
There's surely something brewing in his heart

478
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:50,832
Don't hide it from your friends.
Tell us... what's it all about?

479
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:57,124
So you've reached a stage
where you're exchanging gifts!

480
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,957
For your girlfriend?

481
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,457
Radhe... Nirjara

482
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:21,832
Chander, what's her brother's name?
- Not brother. lt's her fiance

483
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,457
Rameshwar

484
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:28,082
But you needn't be worried.
The match isn't finalised yet...

485
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,915
"they're only talking about it"

486
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,249
what happened, mister?
- Leave the bike at the stand

487
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:49,374
But what is all this about?
- l'll explain, l'll tell you...

488
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,499
will you step aside, please?

489
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:54,124
Master, send a cup of tea for the gentleman?

490
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:57,165
No tea, send a cup of special coffee for him

491
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:01,124
No, l won't have any tea or coffee

492
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,499
lt's time for my prayers.
l must go home

493
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,832
God is not running away

494
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,249
He is where he is,
you can sit here

495
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:10,165
Sit down

496
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:15,290
So, do you know him?

497
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,457
No, who is he?

498
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:24,499
You don't know him?
You don't know your own folks?

499
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:29,832
You ought to drown out of shame!
He's related to you, you know

500
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,165
Related? He isn't...?

501
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,207
what lineage do you come from, mister?

502
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:44,415
Are you going to pickle the lineage?
Not the village...

503
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:49,832
he's related to you through Nirjara.
- How?

504
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,499
He's your brother-in-law

505
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:00,165
Brother-in-law

506
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:02,124
Ponytail

507
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,207
Go on, your brother-in-law's calling you

508
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:11,832
Yes?

509
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:17,457
Look, l'll tell you just once.
Listen carefully

510
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:21,040
l have a scene going with her. who?

511
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:29,040
Nirjara. l've settled it all with her yesterday

512
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,457
Final. You get that?

513
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:35,499
l mustn't see you with her again, okay?

514
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,249
lf l see you with her ever again,
l'll set your ponytail on fire...

515
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:44,915
and you'll fly into the skies like a rocket

516
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:47,499
You get that?

517
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:50,374
Go away

518
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:58,832
Poor guy

519
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,374
You've collected very little money
in the bank, Archana?

520
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:05,290
They take away all the money in the brokerage

521
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,457
But you're getting a loan, aren't you?
- Of course, why not?

522
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,415
God! This is the limit!

523
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:15,415
They've started a brothel right
here in the locality

524
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:21,165
Stop talking and get to work

525
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:23,999
You go to number 3,
and you go to number 5

526
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:28,832
The one who owned the house sold it
and went away to Mumbai

527
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:31,832
These people are not leaving
the locality anymore

528
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:34,540
God alone knows what's going to happen now

529
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:39,832
Nirjara... one moment

530
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:45,499
l... at the college yesterday...

531
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:48,082
nothing, go on

532
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,165
Not from here. Go from there

533
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,957
l'll sit there, Nirjara. You sit here

534
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:36,540
l've brought a gift for you

535
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:41,374
l had bought it yesterday,
but ponytail ruined my mood

536
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:44,499
lt's made to order.
lt'll look great in your feet

537
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,540
No, l don't want it

538
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:52,832
Feeling shy?
why do you have to be shy?

539
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:54,999
Take it

540
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:58,832
lt isn't how you think it is

541
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:02,165
No, it isn't how you think it is

542
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:05,165
lt isn't silver. lt's white gold

543
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:12,957
l don't have at heart
the things you have

544
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,915
But... in the library you said,
you and l...

545
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:20,540
People are watching.
Please don't create a farce

546
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,624
l'm the one who's being subjected to a farce

547
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,832
Everyone in the college laughs at me.
But l don't care for them

548
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,832
we mustn't worry about them because...

549
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:37,499
we have a whole life ahead of us.
Take it now

550
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:41,624
O God!

551
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:47,207
l swear it on my education.
l haven't any such thing on my mind

552
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,332
Do you think l lack something?

553
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,374
Have l bad habits?
Am l not a nice man?

554
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:07,540
Tell me, l'll change everything

555
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:12,207
Nirjara... listen to me

556
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:18,707
Hands off me!

557
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,832
Thug! Rascal!

558
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:55,457
l know this was going to happen!

559
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:59,207
l had told you to say "l love you" to her

560
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:01,790
l even wished you a happy married life!

561
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,415
And you go and tell her that
you'll slap her father

562
00:56:06,208 --> 00:56:08,790
"He'll wake up ten days after
the marriage and wonder where he is"

563
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:11,665
Forget about what has happened
and think of the future

564
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:14,624
l have an idea. Know what?

565
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:19,207
woo lndu, Nirjara's best friend.
She'll lure Nirjara for you

566
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,207
Shut up! He can't score with one girl,
and you're talking about another!

567
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,457
l have an idea too

568
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:31,624
Let's write on the Taj Mahal:
"with love from Radhe Mohan to Nirjara"

569
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:34,207
She'll melt the moment she reads that

570
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:37,415
well? Didn't you like the idea?

571
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:39,707
Here, have some grams

572
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:43,207
She called you a thug, didn't she?

573
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:47,457
So stop getting into fights
and brawls from today

574
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:49,624
Turn into a good boy

575
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:53,415
Your work will be done!

576
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:07,207
You sway because there's a girl with you?

577
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,332
l said l'm sorry.
- will that set everything right?

578
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:18,207
Save him someone!

579
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,290
well? You aren't ashamed are you?

580
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:53,207
when you get beaten up,
you come to Radhe Mohan with your tail wagging?

581
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:56,499
ln trouble, some people invoke God
and some invoke the devil!

582
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:59,832
And there you were... crying Radhe! Radhe!

583
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:03,790
Because we're your friends,
must we getjust about anywhere for you...

584
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,207
and do anything for you?

585
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:09,832
But if you wear a salwar kameez...

586
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,624
and come to us with Gujia,
we'll even lick your feet

587
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:19,665
Aslam... skip the nonsense

588
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:26,207
You hear that? You do?
Go away, get lost

589
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:30,374
There's no friend here.
There's only a jilted lover...

590
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:33,207
who has gone mad for his juliet

591
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:37,374
"A juliet who doesn't
care two hoots for him"

592
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:42,499
Very soon, that juliet will marry someone else
and cock a snook at him

593
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,832
why're you talking to them?
Talk to me

594
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:51,207
what will l say to you? what?
Are you worth talking to at all?

595
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:53,790
You want to hit me...?
- Don't show off your body

596
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:55,457
Hit me!

597
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:02,707
You hit me...?

598
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:07,207
She's marrying someone else,
you say?

599
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:13,207
She'll marry and go away!
You think l'll let her do that?

600
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:15,832
Say it again...

601
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:23,207
You're my friend and you curse me!

602
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:27,624
Lay off!

603
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:38,957
Hit me! Nirjara's not around!
So why you have stopped?

604
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,624
For you, sir

605
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:03,707
Chander, my sorry

606
01:01:14,916 --> 01:01:16,624
l'm sorry, buddy

607
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:19,249
You were the one who told me
to give up fights and brawls...

608
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:21,415
and become a good boy

609
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,499
l made a mistake

610
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:28,457
Listen... at least look at me

611
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:32,707
what is it?

612
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:45,832
You've softened so soon.
l wish you were Nirjara

613
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:49,582
Not Nirjara again!
why don't you forget her?

614
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:54,832
what can l do?

615
01:01:56,958 --> 01:02:00,332
l do my best to forget her,
but l can't

616
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:03,415
l feel as if...

617
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:08,415
l've bequeathed my life in her name

618
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,624
"ln your name..."

619
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:48,832
"in your name..."

620
01:02:52,208 --> 01:03:00,207
"in your name,
l have bequeathed my entire life"

621
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:07,540
"My entire life, my love"

622
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:15,499
"l love you so dearly..."

623
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:19,707
"you are my romance, my love"

624
01:03:58,708 --> 01:04:03,415
"what state has love brought you to?"

625
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:13,832
"Even rose-gardens appear to be
the wastelands to me..."

626
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:19,415
"my loved ones appear to be
strangers to me"

627
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:24,832
"l'm forever lost in your memories..."

628
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:30,290
"people call me mad and crazy"

629
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:36,415
"without you..."

630
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:44,832
"without you,
life is impossible to spend, my love"

631
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:24,457
"Love, l can't be rid of..."

632
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:29,457
"the bond of love cannot be broken"

633
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:35,540
"ln the tears that flow from my eyes..."

634
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:40,457
"l saw you even among the Moon and the stars"

635
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:45,832
"l have burnt in the fires of separation..."

636
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:51,457
"yours is the name my heart
chants every moment"

637
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:57,582
"For you, only for you..."

638
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:05,915
"for you, l shall bear every tyranny
in the world, my love"

639
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:23,582
"ln your name,
l have bequeathed my entire life"

640
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:31,832
"My entire life, my love"

641
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:44,207
"ln your name..."

642
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:57,415
l find it very tough, Lord

643
01:06:58,791 --> 01:07:00,665
l can't even breathe properly nowadays

644
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:04,749
Please do me a favour

645
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:15,332
Give me the strength to forget her

646
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:30,249
l'm not sparing you guys!

647
01:07:31,416 --> 01:07:33,832
You hide the good-looking one
and give me the old hag!

648
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,582
You think l'm drunk?

649
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:40,582
Let me go! Let go of my hand!
- This one's pretty! Oh yes!

650
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,415
where are you going?
- Help!

651
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:44,707
Leave her alone!

652
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,707
who are you?

653
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:50,790
who the hell are you?

654
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:56,457
wait here! what filth are you spreading by
starting a brothel here!

655
01:07:57,375 --> 01:08:00,249
Radhe, that chap was teasing
a girl near the brothel

656
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:01,749
He hit me!

657
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:07,332
Go on

658
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:14,624
No, not him

659
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,540
what is it?

660
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:27,457
Go on

661
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:40,290
Hello

662
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:42,457
Listen

663
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:47,540
l've been waiting for a long time.
Have you brought my money?

664
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:52,749
That man who brought me here
said l'd be given 200,000 rupees

665
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:56,415
when you go to your in-laws,
you'll get the money there

666
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,832
Spread out in all the directions

667
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:02,624
lt's my in-laws
l've got to pay the money to

668
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:05,415
Please ask them to hurry.
l've got to go home

669
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,707
Please give me my money.
- You seem to come from a nice family

670
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:12,832
But you're a whore.
You ought to be ashamed

671
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:19,415
what did you say?

672
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:22,415
You talk rubbish with me...?
l'll slit your tongue!

673
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:25,624
You're not doing me a favour
by giving me the money!

674
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:28,707
You're going to collect interest!
But l don't want your money anymore!

675
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:30,832
l'm going home!
- wait

676
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,707
You're not going home

677
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,540
lf you step out of this place,
you'll go to the cop-house

678
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,332
what do you mean?
- Look

679
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:43,582
This is a brothel the police have raided

680
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:48,624
God! where have l landed?

681
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:52,832
Throw them in the jeep!

682
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:16,790
Sit down

683
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:48,832
l raised my hand at you.
Please forgive me

684
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:53,415
what's your husband's name?
where does he work?

685
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,832
His name is Atmaram.
He works at the Public works Department

686
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:18,332
l'm asking for the file, can't you see?

687
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:21,124
lt's right there.
Go and get it

688
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:25,540
well? what is it?

689
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:29,040
who are you?

690
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:31,124
what are you doing?

691
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,124
Listen to me...

692
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:38,124
what the hell are you doing?
why won't you listen to me?

693
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:40,124
Sharmaji...

694
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:44,124
My glasses?

695
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:46,540
why're you slapping me?

696
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:49,124
lf you raise your hand,
l'll give you a thrashing

697
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:51,249
Enough! Stop it...

698
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,499
what mistake have l made?
why're you hitting me?

699
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:57,124
My hands did the talking.
Now l'll explain

700
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:02,124
Go and bring your wife
back tomorrow morning

701
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:09,124
Else, you'll get four slaps at breakfast
and eight at dinner. Okay?

702
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:18,540
lf you don't treat her well,
l'll have to visit you again

703
01:12:24,041 --> 01:12:26,540
Ponytail... what are you doing here?

704
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:32,915
Do you know that man, Radhe-ji?
- No, but that makes no difference

705
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,124
Brother-in-law...?

706
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:57,124
Sister, your husband is here with Rahul

707
01:13:05,916 --> 01:13:07,624
what happened to you?

708
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:11,124
Nothing... it's just...

709
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:14,415
Mummy...
- Rahul! My son!

710
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:20,540
Mamta, pack your bags.
l'm here to take you back

711
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:27,540
But the money hasn't been...
- l don't want any money

712
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:30,332
Forget all that and just come with me

713
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:41,540
Nirjara, listen to me for a minute.
- l have nothing to discuss with you

714
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:45,415
what you think about me is not true..
- why are you bothering me?

715
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:48,040
l don't want to listen to anything.
Not a minute, not five...

716
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:50,540
not today, not tomorrow, not ever!
You hear that?

717
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:52,540
"And don't you dare follow me!"

718
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:56,332
You tease girls in the temple?
what is your name?

719
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:59,332
where do you live?
Tell us your name!

720
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:03,124
The name is Radhe.
- Forgive me

721
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:05,415
She went in that direction,
you'll go in the other

722
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:31,165
You offered the oil?
- Yes

723
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:34,540
lt's thanks to Him that my sister
has settled down gain

724
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:39,124
No, Nirjara. Mamta has settled down
again not because of Him...

725
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,540
she has settled down thanks to Radhe

726
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:48,124
Your sister had landed in a brothel
in trying to raise a loan

727
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:51,540
Had Radhe not got there
at the nick of the time...

728
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:55,415
l don't know what calamity
would have struck her

729
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:59,165
Mamta herself told me about it

730
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:05,124
He's the one who brought
your brother-in-law to his senses

731
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:08,124
which is why he quietly came and
took Mamta back to his house

732
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:13,124
Radhe didn't even know that
Mamta is your sister

733
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:18,124
just think. when a man,
without any self-interest...

734
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:22,415
helps save another person's family,
is he a bad human being?

735
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:27,040
Yes, l admit he's a bit hard and wayward

736
01:15:27,541 --> 01:15:31,124
For that matter,
even God lives in idols of stone

737
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:35,124
But don't we worship Him?

738
01:15:36,541 --> 01:15:40,124
The truth is that he loves you very much

739
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,957
True love

740
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:48,540
Think about it.
Did he ever misbehave with you?

741
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:51,540
Did he ever try to take advantage of you?

742
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:54,332
He hasn't even touched you

743
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:59,540
You must be wondering why
l'm telling you all this

744
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:06,540
lt's because l've realised...
he's a far better human being than me

745
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:12,332
Better than you, better than me,
better than thousands of others

746
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:17,124
He can even lay down his life for you

747
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:24,915
which is why Radhe Mohan is
your true companion for life

748
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:28,540
Not me

749
01:18:18,374 --> 01:18:21,707
Take a look at me!
Have you ever seen me like this?

750
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:27,415
l used to be so happy!
But ever since l've fallen in love with you...

751
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:29,790
it seems as if my bad times have begun

752
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:37,457
l thought people who gave up their
lives for their love, were such fools

753
01:18:38,458 --> 01:18:40,457
But now l realise, why they do it

754
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:43,332
Rather than suffer like me,
they get their freedom in moments!

755
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:48,498
But you needn't worry.
l'm not dying

756
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:52,623
Because, if l die...
you will become a widow

757
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:57,332
And l can't bear to see you being widowed

758
01:18:58,874 --> 01:19:00,790
The truth is...

759
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:38,582
Enough! Enough!

760
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:41,790
l feel like...

761
01:20:09,874 --> 01:20:14,748
Now look, Nirjara...
l don't want to rape you

762
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:19,332
l only want two minutes from you

763
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:23,457
l want you to hear how l feel.
That's it

764
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:28,332
l want you to be happy.
And smiling

765
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,332
You get what l'm saying?

766
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,790
Everyone in the world falls in love

767
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:45,498
Am l the only one without
a right to love someone...

768
01:20:45,791 --> 01:20:48,415
to have someone love me? well?

769
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:51,790
we'll treat you like a queen

770
01:20:53,333 --> 01:20:59,623
l, my brother, my sister-in-law, Binti...
and all my friends...

771
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:04,540
That boy your father has chosen for you...

772
01:21:08,874 --> 01:21:13,457
l'm not saying he's not a good guy.
He must be a nice chap

773
01:21:15,624 --> 01:21:19,415
Start calling him your brother.
Or make a friend out of him

774
01:21:20,874 --> 01:21:22,790
l'll accept your friend

775
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:27,332
l want to give the priest's daughter a nice life...

776
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:30,665
and that priest wants to snatch my life from me?

777
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:35,332
As if he's the priest,
and l'm an untouchable!

778
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:42,332
what future will you have with him?

779
01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:46,790
when l think of it,
about you and him...

780
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:49,790
it sends my head reeling.
Like this!

781
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:58,415
After listening to all this,
you must surely realise...

782
01:21:59,624 --> 01:22:03,457
how dearly l love you?
lf you still don't get it, l...

783
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:07,332
l know what l'll do!

784
01:22:15,791 --> 01:22:18,332
Go away! Go away!

785
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:27,790
Go away, else l'll kill you. Go!

786
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:32,332
But what will l do with my life then?

787
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:37,790
l don't want to live a moment without you

788
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:41,457
Yes! l have forcibly brought you here!

789
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,623
And yes, l'm indeed screaming at you!

790
01:22:47,916 --> 01:22:49,790
l'm threatening you!

791
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:53,665
That's only because...

792
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:59,332
it's because l love you very much

793
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:05,665
Because l think you were made only for me...
only for me

794
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:09,790
You were born for me alone

795
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:14,582
Ask your God! Ask Him!

796
01:23:17,499 --> 01:23:23,790
l'm going through so much of pain...
so much of misery, God!

797
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:45,790
Forgive me

798
01:23:47,791 --> 01:23:49,790
Do please forgive me

799
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:07,498
"l've draped the scarf...
l dance for you"

800
01:24:34,791 --> 01:24:37,623
"l drape the scarf and dance..."

801
01:24:38,166 --> 01:24:41,665
"for l have lost my heart"

802
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:49,790
"l've fallen in love with you,
l've lost my heart to you"

803
01:25:03,624 --> 01:25:09,790
"Your love gives me a high...
l've lost my heart to you"

804
01:25:11,791 --> 01:25:18,332
"l've fallen in love with you,
l've lost my heart to you"

805
01:25:19,791 --> 01:25:24,790
"l dance, l break every promise..."

806
01:25:25,791 --> 01:25:31,790
"Every promise,
l break and dance today..."

807
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:09,290
"My bangles speak, my anklets say..."

808
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:13,332
"come with the bridal palanquin
and take me away, my love"

809
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:16,790
"with henna on my palms..."

810
01:26:17,791 --> 01:26:21,332
"bridal vermillion on my forehead..."

811
01:26:21,624 --> 01:26:26,790
"l'll dress up only for you, my love"

812
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:34,290
"The Spring of my beauty is here...
for l have lost my heart to you"

813
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:42,582
"l drape the scarf today
and dance for you"

814
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:29,457
"ln your name l shall bequeath..."

815
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:33,332
"this story of my realisation"

816
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:37,457
"lf we are to unite, we shall unite..."

817
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:41,332
"not to be separated for ages"

818
01:27:41,666 --> 01:27:46,790
"l have waited for years,
my love"

819
01:27:47,791 --> 01:27:50,623
"Even in pining l found succour,
my love"

820
01:27:51,124 --> 01:27:54,332
"l've lost my heart to you"

821
01:27:55,791 --> 01:28:02,332
"l've fallen in love with you,
my heart is no longer mine"

822
01:28:03,874 --> 01:28:08,790
"Every promise,
l break and dance today..."

823
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:07,873
So you're going to make us
shut down our business?

824
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:10,957
You ought to have kept your
bullying ways to your college

825
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:41,457
Get up

826
01:33:26,124 --> 01:33:29,123
Nirjara, how can you go on like this?

827
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:36,623
l want to meet him once.
- what for?

828
01:33:39,208 --> 01:33:41,623
why're you unnecessarily bothering yourself?

829
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:47,457
You don't understand, lndu.
- l understand everything

830
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:52,123
But is there any point in
all this anymore?

831
01:33:53,124 --> 01:33:58,123
The sooner you get him out of
your mind the better

832
01:33:59,958 --> 01:34:03,207
You understand?
Let's go now. C'mon

833
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,123
Get an injection! Quick!

834
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:15,957
where has he gone?

835
01:35:56,124 --> 01:35:58,123
He has survived

836
01:35:58,624 --> 01:36:02,498
But neither can he understand
anything nor recognise anyone

837
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:09,457
lt's really very sad but every effort of ours...

838
01:36:09,624 --> 01:36:12,123
to bring about an improvement in Radhe's condition,
has failed

839
01:36:14,124 --> 01:36:16,623
That's exactly why l wish to say
something to you folks

840
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:19,123
Of course. Please go ahead

841
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:23,623
Although l'm a doctor,
l still believe in God

842
01:36:25,083 --> 01:36:27,123
whenever l fall sick...

843
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:31,123
my mother gives me oblations
before any other medicines

844
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:35,957
lt has to do with devotion, it defies logic

845
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:42,123
Because prayers and medicines are both
very important in our society

846
01:36:42,999 --> 01:36:43,998
Absolutely

847
01:36:44,666 --> 01:36:46,665
l was going to suggest something of the sort

848
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:49,998
You must've heard of Sripurdham?

849
01:36:53,166 --> 01:36:55,623
Although medical science does not believe in it...

850
01:36:56,166 --> 01:37:01,457
Swami Sheelbhadra uses ancient
cures to heal patients

851
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:04,457
lf medical science does not believe it,
why must you believe it?

852
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:10,123
Do you know? Patients are bound in chains
and treated worse than animals

853
01:37:11,124 --> 01:37:13,957
And you want to send Radhe there?
- That's because...

854
01:37:14,624 --> 01:37:19,123
in a fit of violence, they shouldn't hurt
themselves or anyone else

855
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:29,748
whatever this boy just said is not wrong

856
01:37:31,124 --> 01:37:36,123
But it's also true that several patients
like Radhe have been cured there

857
01:37:38,124 --> 01:37:40,623
lt has to do with faith and devotion

858
01:37:42,124 --> 01:37:44,623
You either have it, or you don't

859
01:37:49,124 --> 01:37:51,707
where is Sripurdham?

860
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:54,123
just telephone them

861
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:57,623
Their workers will come
and personally take Radhe away

862
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:05,082
what are you thinking of doing?

863
01:38:06,124 --> 01:38:08,790
what can we think of, Aslam?
we'll have to send him there

864
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:11,957
You take just about anyone's advise seriously!

865
01:38:13,083 --> 01:38:18,207
He spoke in our own interests.
- Really? And what was that?

866
01:38:19,624 --> 01:38:21,623
To not take your brother back home?

867
01:38:23,166 --> 01:38:25,623
To hand him over to some crazy ascetic?

868
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:28,623
So that he can try his mumbo-jumbo on him...?

869
01:38:29,124 --> 01:38:31,582
even if it leaves your brother dead?
- Aslam!

870
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:34,790
The doctor's trying to save his neck...

871
01:38:34,916 --> 01:38:37,123
and these folks don't want anyone
to be a burden on them

872
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:40,748
lf your brother is such a burden,
don't take him home!

873
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:45,123
l'll take him away.
l'll look after him, l'll nurse him!

874
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:48,915
But l'm not letting you send him
to some ascetic's ashram!

875
01:38:49,124 --> 01:38:51,623
Let me tell you that.
And you better listen to me!

876
01:38:52,124 --> 01:38:53,123
lnsolent!

877
01:38:55,124 --> 01:38:59,790
l'm the one who has pampered these boys.
lt's my fault!

878
01:39:01,124 --> 01:39:03,957
Else, could anyone misbehave with you...?

879
01:39:06,124 --> 01:39:07,957
Gayatri, calm down

880
01:39:09,166 --> 01:39:13,915
He's upset because
he loves Radhe so much

881
01:39:17,166 --> 01:39:19,123
Go and sit there

882
01:39:25,916 --> 01:39:29,790
Let him go.
Maybe it's good for Radhe

883
01:39:33,458 --> 01:39:35,123
Look at me, Aslam

884
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:40,623
l can't say whether
l have understood Radhe

885
01:39:42,999 --> 01:39:47,790
But one thing l'm proud of...
he has friends like you

886
01:39:52,916 --> 01:39:54,623
Forgive me, brother

887
01:40:00,124 --> 01:40:02,623
You know why
l'm sending you to Sripurdham ?

888
01:40:03,166 --> 01:40:05,957
Because l'm fed up of you! That's it!

889
01:40:07,124 --> 01:40:10,623
l'm sick of your fights and brawls

890
01:40:12,124 --> 01:40:14,123
l'm tired of reasoning with you!

891
01:40:15,124 --> 01:40:18,623
l now want you to get out of my sight...

892
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:22,623
so l can breathe easily!
Do you hear that?

893
01:40:24,458 --> 01:40:26,790
what are you doing?

894
01:40:33,124 --> 01:40:38,123
Look... l've been scolding him.
And he doesn't even talk back

895
01:40:42,124 --> 01:40:47,915
Radhe... l'll sit with you at
the station henceforth

896
01:40:48,583 --> 01:40:51,748
we'll sit outside the college.
we'll act like bullies...

897
01:40:52,124 --> 01:40:54,123
l'll join you too

898
01:40:55,124 --> 01:41:00,123
just get well...
please get well

899
01:41:10,749 --> 01:41:13,123
Get well, please

900
01:41:17,958 --> 01:41:19,123
Sister-in-law...

901
01:41:22,124 --> 01:41:24,790
the van has arrived
to take Radhe away

902
01:43:10,874 --> 01:43:18,873
"why does this happen in love?"

903
01:44:10,166 --> 01:44:14,957
"why does loyalty..."

904
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:18,790
"not beget loyalty?"

905
01:44:19,499 --> 01:44:24,123
"why are good wishes..."

906
01:44:24,791 --> 01:44:27,957
"not answered with good wishes?"

907
01:44:28,791 --> 01:44:33,665
"why is happiness..."

908
01:44:33,999 --> 01:44:37,123
"not reciprocated with joy?"

909
01:44:38,124 --> 01:44:43,123
"what does this happen in love?"

910
01:45:13,999 --> 01:45:16,123
"Love makes you weep..."

911
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:18,957
"it makes you forget the world"

912
01:45:19,458 --> 01:45:24,665
"lt makes you pine,
it makes you restless"

913
01:45:25,458 --> 01:45:29,748
"what has love turned people into?"

914
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,748
"They met their beloveds..."

915
01:45:33,124 --> 01:45:35,123
"and separated"

916
01:45:36,124 --> 01:45:40,790
"All they got was misery even in Spring..."

917
01:45:41,458 --> 01:45:46,623
"their lifetimes being spent,
waiting for their beloveds"

918
01:45:50,624 --> 01:45:58,623
"why doesn't a smile beget a smile?"

919
01:45:59,791 --> 01:46:08,123
"why isn't loyalty greeted with loyalty?"

920
01:46:51,458 --> 01:46:55,123
"Time never comes to a standstill..."

921
01:46:56,791 --> 01:47:00,707
"you do not keep vigil on friends"

922
01:47:01,916 --> 01:47:06,123
"when medicines cease to heal..."

923
01:47:06,958 --> 01:47:12,623
"what does one do?"

924
01:47:16,166 --> 01:47:24,123
"why isn'tjoy greeted with joy?"

925
01:47:25,499 --> 01:47:34,123
"why isn't loyalty paid back with loyalty?"

926
01:47:54,249 --> 01:47:55,415
Chander...

927
01:47:57,958 --> 01:48:02,623
no one's telling me how Radhe is.
where have they taken him?

928
01:48:03,624 --> 01:48:05,623
But you surely know?

929
01:48:06,166 --> 01:48:08,623
Girls are not allowed there

930
01:48:09,458 --> 01:48:12,623
But Radhe will be all right. Don't worry.

931
01:48:13,208 --> 01:48:16,457
l've put in a word to God
and He too has told me...

932
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:19,082
that Radhe will be all right

933
01:48:20,624 --> 01:48:22,415
Praise the Lord...

934
01:49:20,458 --> 01:49:24,290
See how ardently she is praying, Rameshwar

935
01:49:28,624 --> 01:49:30,290
l wonder who's ill

936
01:49:30,624 --> 01:49:33,623
Has she had something to eat?
- No

937
01:49:34,958 --> 01:49:37,123
She's been praying since this morning.
- This morning?

938
01:49:38,499 --> 01:49:42,207
Yes, a boy in her college is...
- ls...?

939
01:49:44,291 --> 01:49:47,373
He's lying in the ashram at Sripur

940
01:49:54,624 --> 01:49:57,123
This girl is just like her mother

941
01:49:57,624 --> 01:50:01,123
She's been fasting and praying for a stranger

942
01:50:01,624 --> 01:50:04,415
He's no stranger, Guruji.
- No...?

943
01:50:11,708 --> 01:50:15,623
That boy belongs to Nirjara's college and Nirjara...

944
01:50:16,624 --> 01:50:20,623
Yes? Go on.
- She's in love with him

945
01:50:55,624 --> 01:51:01,123
Nirjara, is what Rameshwar saying... true?

946
01:51:07,166 --> 01:51:08,957
Yes, father

947
01:51:11,124 --> 01:51:12,623
Lord!

948
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:19,623
l've committed no sin, father.
l've done nothing wrong

949
01:51:20,124 --> 01:51:22,123
what is this if not wrong?

950
01:51:24,124 --> 01:51:26,123
Maybe that boy has done us favours

951
01:51:27,749 --> 01:51:30,123
He has helped your sister settle down again

952
01:51:30,999 --> 01:51:33,623
But will you entrust yourself to him for that?

953
01:51:34,124 --> 01:51:36,123
l already have, father

954
01:51:38,708 --> 01:51:40,707
l've given him my heart

955
01:51:43,624 --> 01:51:45,873
And my heart isn't outside my body

956
01:53:34,999 --> 01:53:36,790
what's going on?

957
01:54:50,124 --> 01:54:52,832
How can you afford
to be so disheartened?

958
01:54:54,208 --> 01:54:59,790
l wasn't ever polite with him

959
01:55:03,666 --> 01:55:04,957
Don't worry

960
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:09,623
He... he'll return soon

961
01:55:11,583 --> 01:55:14,123
Our Radhe will return.
just you see

962
01:55:52,124 --> 01:55:53,123
Swamiji...

963
01:56:05,124 --> 01:56:06,623
Swamiji...!

964
01:56:22,708 --> 01:56:30,790
Rameshwarji...

965
01:56:31,958 --> 01:56:33,790
who is it?

966
01:56:42,749 --> 01:56:47,623
Rameshwarji... please take me to Radhe.
just once

967
01:56:52,624 --> 01:56:54,957
l'll remain indebted to you all my life

968
01:57:01,708 --> 01:57:03,957
All right, we'll leave in the morning

969
02:01:47,749 --> 02:01:51,790
Mahantji... Nirjara has gone to
Sripurdham with Rameshwar

970
02:01:52,124 --> 02:01:54,748
A boy from his college has been admitted there

971
02:01:55,124 --> 02:01:57,123
She said she would return by nightfall

972
02:01:57,666 --> 02:01:59,665
Here are the keys to your house

973
02:02:00,208 --> 02:02:04,623
The priest is here to meet you.
- Priest?

974
02:02:04,958 --> 02:02:06,957
Yes, Nirjara's father

975
02:02:39,749 --> 02:02:42,290
You've seen what state he's in,
haven't you?

976
02:02:44,541 --> 02:02:46,748
Do you think we didn't want to
have a daughter-in-law like you?

977
02:02:49,749 --> 02:02:54,290
But perhaps that is not possible anymore

978
02:02:56,833 --> 02:02:59,457
Had my brother been all right...

979
02:02:59,749 --> 02:03:02,623
l'd have begged your father for your hand

980
02:03:04,458 --> 02:03:10,748
But to think of him now and to hope that he...

981
02:03:16,791 --> 02:03:23,498
it's futile. lt's over lt's all over

982
02:03:30,749 --> 02:03:34,748
The things man thinks of doing...
and what turns out to be

983
02:03:40,916 --> 02:03:48,123
lt isn't right to think only of your happiness
and cause anguish to others

984
02:03:50,374 --> 02:03:56,998
You know, your father has thought
of nothing but your welfare

985
02:04:00,124 --> 02:04:02,915
He's the father who has given you life

986
02:04:04,374 --> 02:04:06,373
You mustn't be obstinate
and drive him to death

987
02:04:10,458 --> 02:04:12,373
Give him his due, please

988
02:04:39,958 --> 02:04:42,207
when is it auspicious to hold the wedding,
holy sir?

989
02:04:42,999 --> 02:04:50,998
Friday, july 10 is an auspicious
date for the wedding

990
02:04:58,291 --> 02:05:02,123
lt's all over. Looks like Nirjara is going to be
married to Rameshwar

991
02:05:03,374 --> 02:05:07,915
why're you hitting him?
- He always talks nonsense!

992
02:05:08,958 --> 02:05:11,123
Radhe's not yet dead.
He's just ill

993
02:05:13,958 --> 02:05:17,123
wait and see.
He'll come back as soon as he gets well

994
02:05:17,374 --> 02:05:20,123
And when will that be? when?
After the marriage is over?

995
02:05:20,374 --> 02:05:23,207
No, he'll come soon

996
02:05:25,374 --> 02:05:27,373
l have a feeling he's coming back soon

997
02:06:04,374 --> 02:06:06,373
where are you going?
Get back there

998
02:12:08,958 --> 02:12:13,915
"Even in death,
we shall not break our promise"

999
02:12:15,916 --> 02:12:20,373
"we will never part from each other"

1000
02:12:22,374 --> 02:12:27,373
"Ours is a relationship spanning many births"

1001
02:12:29,291 --> 02:12:33,998
"who has ever separated life from the body?"

1002
02:12:36,833 --> 02:12:38,415
"without you..."

1003
02:12:43,458 --> 02:12:55,373
"without you, this ocean has no shore,
my love"

1004
02:13:05,374 --> 02:13:13,373
"ln your name,
l have bequeathed my entire life, my love"

1005
02:13:20,749 --> 02:13:25,957
"My entire life, my love"
