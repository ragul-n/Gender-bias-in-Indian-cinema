1
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,257
Oh, no! He has been caught!

2
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:51,669
Kill Dholakia!

3
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,092
What is this?

4
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:54,839
Why have I been
brought here this way?

5
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,590
Kishan is with us!
I don't understand..

6
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,419
You had the guts to send
him to murder Shankar?

7
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,094
Don't talk nonsense!

8
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:05,091
I have been with Sarkar
for years, he's God to me.

9
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,924
- Is it?
- Shankar is like my brother.

10
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:12,593
When the public creates a God,
a devil like me is born!

11
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:16,091
Shankar will die.. he has to die!

12
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:17,925
I will kill him!

13
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:24,260
I am his right-hand man.. his
security is under my control.

14
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:25,759
Right.

15
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,507
I will finish him
off in his own house.

16
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,509
Now, you..

17
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,259
Want to hear more?

18
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:45,088
Dholakia was the one above me..

19
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:50,509
Tell me.

20
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,335
Dholakia has been killed!

21
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,092
What?

22
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,010
They work in absolute secrecy.

23
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,417
One person gets in touch with
the other, there is no third link.

24
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,423
I ordered Kishan to kill you.

25
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,920
And Dholakia ordered me.

26
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,174
Now that he is dead, the
link above him has been broken.

27
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:23,342
"Govinda."

28
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:25,511
Then why should you stay alive?

29
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,674
"Negotiation, bribe, punishment,
spying."

30
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:36,917
"Negotiation, bribe, punishment,
spying."

31
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,005
"An anguished soul.."

32
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,417
"Who does it turn to?"

33
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:54,752
"Sarkar is the last stop for him."

34
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,005
If the prey does not
walk into the trap..

35
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:06,840
We will take the trap to it.

36
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:17,167
Both father and son are
very fond of social service.

37
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:25,011
A foreign company wants..

38
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:30,010
To put up a huge power-plant..

39
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:34,759
In Maharashtra.

40
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,007
This project is worth 2 billion.

41
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,007
Within the first
year of production..

42
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,006
We will make a minimum
profit of 20 million..

43
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,917
That will increase every year.

44
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,755
Only if the project starts.

45
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,259
What is that supposed to mean'?

46
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:59,253
Ma'am, you are talking of India.
That too Maharashtra..

47
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:00,509
It's impossible!

48
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:04,417
Mr. Qazi, I detest that word!

49
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,007
Our problems won't go away
based on what you like or dislike.

50
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:18,008
Dad, I don't like his attitude.
It's negative!

51
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,834
There must be something that
turns the impossible around?

52
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,255
Not something.. someone..

53
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,759
Who?

54
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,509
Sarkar!

55
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,252
Who is Sarkar?

56
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,088
A gangster in the garb of a leader.

57
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Long live Sarkar!

58
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:34,009
The greatest victory of..

59
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:41,422
A father is in being
defeated by his son.

60
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,009
I am proud that..

61
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:49,010
My son has done far
more in a couple of years..

62
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:53,589
Than I have done in a lifetime.

63
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:00,919
Where is Shankar?

64
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:06,343
Either you play
politics or we do business!

65
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,004
Even Delhi is heating
up over this issue.

66
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,506
You better pay us heed now..

67
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,340
By the way, the
minister also wants the same.

68
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:34,593
You have come to my
house on dad's birthday.

69
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,927
That is why I'm
still listening to you.

70
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,423
If this threat was
made any other day..

71
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:51,503
Shankar, dad is calling.

72
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:07,008
Tell the minister, if he
thinks of Maharashtra..

73
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:12,510
Maharashtra will think of him!

74
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,178
"You are unique."

75
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,843
"You are unique."

76
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:57,917
"We feel very relaxed
under your protection."

77
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,927
"Hail Govinda."

78
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:08,844
"Hail Govinda."

79
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:14,840
"Your name echoes in all
the corners of the world."

80
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:22,841
"Everyone is calling
out to you.. Govinda."

81
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,517
"Hail Govinda."

82
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:37,340
"Negotiation, bribe, punishment,
spying."

83
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:40,011
"All the notes are yours."

84
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,836
"You create a rhythm."

85
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:49,425
"You are the one who sustains life."

86
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,500
"The spectacle you create.
The spectacle."

87
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:07,005
"The spectacle. Spectacle."

88
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:13,591
"Hail Govinda."

89
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,590
Bhandari, don't make it too bitter.

90
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,260
Have you put the
cardamom in the sweets?

91
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,425
Yes, I have..

92
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,094
Only if Amrita and
Chikoo were here..

93
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,677
Chikoo must not like it in Nagpur.

94
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,177
I just spoke to sister-in-law.

95
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,424
If Chikoo didn't have fever,
they would surely be here.

96
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,175
How are you Shankar?

97
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,927
Before elections,
you were here everyday!

98
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,002
Since Sarkar has made me Chief
Minister, I don't get the time.

99
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:23,671
If I complain to him, you will
have all the time in the world.

100
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:27,417
You need not bother. Mr. Kanga
is already making sure of that.

101
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,923
Shankar, this is Ms. Anita.

102
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:38,589
And I am Hassan Qazi.

103
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,925
Come in.

104
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:55,010
Wish you a very
happy birthday, Sarkar!

105
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,342
Thank You.

106
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:57,759
Take this.

107
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,427
Shinde, how are things?

108
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,755
What can I say, Sarkar?

109
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,594
Whenever I try to make things
happen, Mr. Kanga stages a walkout.

110
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:12,417
His name should be Johnny Walker!

111
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,588
Give me your chair,
I will stop walking out!

112
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,002
If only we had 11
more elected members..

113
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,505
We wouldn't have to
take your bitterness.

114
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:27,511
Perhaps it's this kind of sweet
talk that makes the MLA's stick.

115
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,007
Only time will tell who is what!

116
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,175
Kanga.

117
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:37,501
If you can't say
anything nice, just shut up.

118
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:42,669
Yes, tell me.

119
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,673
Sarkar, there's a problem.

120
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,085
This is Anita, CEO of the
Sheppard power plant project.

121
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,425
Hello.

122
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,092
Greetings.

123
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,340
And this is Hassan Qazi.

124
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,252
I am your fan, sir!

125
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:22,921
"Govinda."

126
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,256
You must have heard of the
Sheppard power plant project.

127
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,425
No!

128
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,169
This is going to be
India's biggest power plant.

129
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,836
5000 mega watts.. - Skip the
technical details, get to the point.

130
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:15,171
Sarkar, this could solve
all our electricity problems.

131
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,589
So, what's the trouble?

132
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:22,424
It's the place where the power
plant will be situated, Thakarvvadi!

133
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,842
Why Thakarvvadi?

134
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,007
Our engineers have carried
out detailed technical surveys.

135
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:35,926
They think this is the ideal
place to put up the power plant.

136
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,002
But to make way for the plant..

137
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,166
Some densely populated
villages will have to be vacated.

138
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,423
These areas are around Thakarvvadi.

139
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,002
Naipara, Bekul, Kuchera, Siddhi..

140
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,509
Some five villages in
and around Thakarvvadi.

141
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,085
And until we..

142
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,755
- Shinde?
- Yes Sarkar..

143
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:06,170
How many people live
in these villages?

144
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,419
According to the 1995 census..

145
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,592
40,000.

146
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,094
40,000 people live there.

147
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,419
Have you gone crazy?

148
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,669
Bringing such a proposal to me?

149
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,592
What is wrong with you?

150
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,425
Sarkar, I thought..

151
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,502
If this is how you think then
I will have to think about you.

152
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,926
What are you thinking?

153
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,003
How many times have
I told you that..

154
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,927
You are the Chief Minister of
entire Maharashtra, not just Mumbai.

155
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,010
Indulging in petty politics..

156
00:16:54,083 --> 00:17:00,841
You've lost the capability of
seeing and understanding things.

157
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,589
You better understand this well.

158
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,590
You exist because of the Government,
not the other way round.

159
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,005
You jump at every
prospect that comes your way.

160
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,176
Sarkar, it won't happen again.

161
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,256
How can one do business where
the law of the jungle rules'?

162
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,256
The lion rules the jungle.

163
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:35,669
If the time is right, even a circus
clown can make the lion dance.

164
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,092
What is that supposed to mean'?

165
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,252
Nothing. I said it just like that.

166
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:46,251
How can the project happen?

167
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:51,089
Anita, I have a
feeling it will happen.

168
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,092
How?

169
00:17:53,208 --> 00:18:00,422
During the entire discussion,
Shankar Nagre didn't utter a word.

170
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,593
- So?
- So?

171
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,085
Dad, this project is good.

172
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,094
It will take
Maharashtra to new heights.

173
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:24,343
People live on the ground!

174
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,172
Like you say.

175
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:38,502
Before thinking about short term
gains, think about future losses.

176
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:46,754
Likewise, before short-term losses,
think of lasting gains.

177
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,004
If the people have
put their faith in us..

178
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,007
It's our
responsibility to take decisions..

179
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:02,668
That are tough but right for them.

180
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,007
If we are afraid that people
will disapprove of these decisions..

181
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,427
Then what kind of leaders are we?

182
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:32,921
What do you think of the
people associated with this project?

183
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:38,759
Something about them
is bothering me..

184
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,084
People will be people,
we will handle them!

185
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:51,001
How will we convince Rao sir?

186
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:59,338
You! You make him understand.

187
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:07,170
Dad, this project is very
important for Maharashtra.

188
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,589
He will have to understand!

189
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,508
"Govinda."

190
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,585
"Govinda."

191
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,425
Thakarvvadi!

192
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,087
If Maharashtra is the Ganges of
politics, Thakarwadi is its source.

193
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:06,759
And Mumbai?

194
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,756
Mumbai is the ocean where
all the rivers merge together.

195
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,509
And Rao sir?

196
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,177
Whatever I am today
is because of him.

197
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,005
Even after all these years..

198
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,417
I remember every
lesson he has taught me.

199
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:38,669
Shankar, all this
land belongs to me.

200
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,260
"Govinda."

201
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:46,509
"Govinda."

202
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,006
Our school would be there,
I studied there..

203
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:54,083
"Govinda."

204
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,426
Greetings.

205
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,592
Greetings..

206
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,467
- Everything fine?
- Yes, sir.

207
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:12,751
- Greetings.
- Greetings. - Greetings.

208
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,009
Where is Rao sir?

209
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,836
Rao sir was always here,
where have you been?

210
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:49,010
Only when you genuinely respect..

211
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,917
Somebody, you should
seek their blessings..

212
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,842
Right, Chandar?

213
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,509
Sarkar?

214
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,002
This pickle is made
from local dried fish..

215
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,427
And your will vision
will not get blurred.

216
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:16,844
To show off and for sophistication,
the British named it Bombay Duck.

217
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:23,011
You are 60 years old now,
eat this everyday..

218
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,256
And your vision
will not get blurred.

219
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,839
You will be far sighted.

220
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,502
At least, try the sweet dish.

221
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,593
Dad is not allowed oily stuff.

222
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:36,008
I can see this
reflected in your politics..

223
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:40,759
It's neither greasy nor fiery.

224
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,083
But politics is a function
of the mind, not the stomach.

225
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,339
Do you agree, Shankar?

226
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,585
Get our men together..

227
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:49,760
They have turned into cowards.

228
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,256
Nanhe, Ramakant, where is everyone?

229
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,335
- Get everyone!
- I'll call you.

230
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,010
Grandpa, the
collector is cutting down..

231
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,835
The rosewood trees
in the villages.

232
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:00,339
He says they're on government soil!

233
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,335
He has numbered the
trees with chalk!

234
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:06,258
You better stop him or he
will destroy Thakarvvadi.

235
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:08,926
I will talk to him.

236
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,840
Don't you see who's here!

237
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:26,921
I had seen you a few years ago,
during the elections.

238
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,255
Grandpa, if I see his jeep
here again, I will burn it down.

239
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:39,090
Somji, how many times have I told
you violence is not the solution.

240
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,005
I will talk to him.

241
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,926
Talk! Keep talking!

242
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,925
I will break his bones then
you can talk to him all you want.

243
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,343
The whole village is being
burnt and they are talking.

244
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,511
Continue with it,
I'll not spare anyone!

245
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:55,675
Come on, let's go!

246
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:04,752
Subhash, that's my
grandson Sanjay Somji.

247
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,344
He runs the farmer's cooperative.

248
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:11,588
My Somji is a little hot tempered,
but he's a very nice person.

249
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:15,091
The farmers treat
him like elder brother.

250
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,674
Shankar, come and sit here son.

251
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,760
You can attend to your calls later.

252
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,177
Don't give them
false hopes, Subhash.

253
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,004
The farmers have lost
faith in their own government..

254
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:33,587
They will never
trust a foreign company.

255
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:36,090
But this will be very
beneficial for Maharashtra.

256
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,673
I am not opposed to development.

257
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:42,007
But if politics is played
in the name of progress..

258
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:47,510
Your credibility will
be questioned Subhash.

259
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,173
Why don't you look at
the project report once?

260
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:52,010
I am a believer of
Ayurveda (medical treatment)..

261
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,175
I feel the pulse..
I don't read reports.

262
00:25:54,167 --> 00:26:00,095
And I have a firm grip on
the pulse of Maharashtra.

263
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,167
So, what does the
pulse of Maharashtra say?

264
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:10,500
I'm not trying to stop you.

265
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:12,669
This is just my way of making
you understand the situation.

266
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,006
Somji too gets impatient at times..

267
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:20,000
Look, son,
I'm a Gandhian but I have..

268
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:25,669
Studied revolutionary
thoughts too.

269
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:31,669
Blood is as worthless as
water running in the veins.

270
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:35,337
It becomes worthy only
when it is shed for a cause.

271
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,675
Subhash, you were just
like this when you were young.

272
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,756
It's good to be
passionate when you are young.

273
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:53,093
But you will face
problems along the way.

274
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:57,508
Every problem is an opportunity
to get closer to your goal.

275
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,425
So what do you want to do?

276
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:09,924
I believe in this project.

277
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,344
I will visit each and every
village and convince them.

278
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,667
Subhash, do you have
faith in Shankar?

279
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,217
Yes, he does!

280
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:31,088
And I have faith in
your dad's faith!

281
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,717
$0?

282
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,254
Go ahead!

283
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,843
This time you were genuine!

284
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,592
Bless you!

285
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,836
Do you think people
will agree so easily?

286
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,085
- No..
- Excuse me..

287
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,010
Hello, how are you?

288
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:08,506
- Yes, he is right here. Fine.
- Hassan Qazi.

289
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:09,755
Yes. Dad.

290
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,085
- Hello.
- Hi, this is Mike Rajan.

291
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:16,590
Anita speaks very highly of you.

292
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,505
So, how are you, young man?

293
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,175
Fine.

294
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,252
Shankar, what is the
issue with Rao sir?

295
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,502
The issue is not with Rao sir,
it's with Thakarwadi.

296
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,342
I will handle it.

297
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,002
Everyone knows..

298
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,336
The Nagre's are experts at
dealing with such situations.

299
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,002
Once you force..

300
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:37,667
Not by force, this decision
will be made by choice.

301
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,754
- Like I said, I will handle it.
- Don't worry.

302
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:46,090
Okay, give the phone to Anita.

303
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,425
Sure.

304
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:49,759
Anita!

305
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,425
Yes, Dad..

306
00:28:56,292 --> 00:29:02,004
Mr. Shankar, foreign companies..

307
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:09,422
Are just like iron nails!

308
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,504
- What do you mean?
- I just said it.

309
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:20,007
Everyone in India is waiting..

310
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:26,341
To hammer them down!

311
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:33,173
I always make money for my partners.

312
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:40,173
This project is worth $2 billion.

313
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:46,088
They are there.. we are here..

314
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:52,003
Even the slightest sleight of..

315
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:58,921
Hand will get us 20-50 million.

316
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:03,169
It's a very common thing.

317
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:08,509
Half and half!

318
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:10,717
Half of what?

319
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:14,921
I was telling Shankar an old tale..

320
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,594
Really? What?

321
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,252
He just offered me a bribe!

322
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:31,172
I don't know who you
are nor do I know him.

323
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,425
All I know is that Maharashtra
needs this power project.

324
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:42,338
And every person attached to
this project needs to be honest.

325
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,255
This is not an advice,
it's a warning!

326
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,005
Even I didn't
understand what he meant..

327
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,255
Was he speaking in Hindi?

328
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,083
Chikoo! Did you get the
watch grandpa sent you?

329
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,342
Ask if he liked it.

330
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:11,925
Why don't you ask him yourself..

331
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,092
Me?

332
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,674
Chikoo! How is my tiger?

333
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,425
Did you get the watch?

334
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:23,925
Why not?

335
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,252
Its old fashioned.

336
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:33,251
But I thought it was
strong and sturdy.

337
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:34,669
What's your style?

338
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:39,759
Uncle Shankar's style.

339
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,593
That's what everyone
says these days.

340
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:44,926
Where is Amrita? Call her.

341
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:49,669
It's hard to know what
the kids want today.

342
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:54,171
He is right. Why should we saddle
them with our likes and dislikes?

343
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:58,587
We have to change with the times.

344
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,835
If we change, how will we
recognise that times have changed'?

345
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,670
Your words won't influence me..

346
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,927
Yes, Amrita. How are you?

347
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:12,509
The information is correct.

348
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,923
His nephew has got the contract
to build the shopping mall.

349
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,172
And Jadhav is asking for his share.

350
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,260
Chandar, withdraw our tender.

351
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:29,759
That's not possible.

352
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,169
We didn't come to
power to be contractors!

353
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,834
What is the problem with
the official from Andheri?

354
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,092
Why do You ask?

355
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,173
He has been trying
to meet me for weeks..

356
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:49,418
He's a fraud.

357
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,092
That's for me to decide.

358
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,085
But I've known him for years..

359
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,842
Yes.

360
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:02,011
Dad has thrown Hassan Qazi..

361
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:06,088
Out of the project and
has apologized for it.

362
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,923
He has nothing to
do with our company.

363
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:12,751
He was just a facilitator
to get us some contacts.

364
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:20,586
- Don't waste any more time on him.
- You are right.

365
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,669
When are you going to Thakarvvadi?

366
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,840
- Tomorrow.
- Can I come along?

367
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:28,925
I have never been there.

368
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:33,421
Shankar, Thakarwadi
is my dream project.

369
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,922
It means more to me than to you.

370
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:58,175
"There is dawn in your eyes."

371
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:07,256
"There is dawn in your eyes."

372
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,757
"Slightly awake and
slightly slept, eyes."

373
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:20,835
"The sky has bowed down to my eyes."

374
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:30,002
"There is dawn in your eyes."

375
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:38,422
"There is dawn in your eyes."

376
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,003
Why is this project
so important for you?

377
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,757
It's for Thakarvvadi.

378
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:49,344
Are the people your priority
or the success of the project?

379
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,092
What's the difference?

380
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:56,003
This project is an
investment to earn profit.

381
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,586
The true meaning of profit is
only when everybody benefits.

382
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:04,006
"I've chosen so many.."

383
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:08,338
"“..colours of life for you."

384
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:13,009
"Your beauty is like the.."

385
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:16,917
"“..sun rays sparkling on water."

386
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,838
"Alleys decorated
with colorful flowers."

387
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,000
"There is dawn in your eyes."

388
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:39,214
"There is dawn in your eyes."

389
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:44,253
People live in an illusion that
the aim of life is to earn money.

390
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,002
The aim of life should
be not to make money..

391
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,756
But to bring about a change!

392
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,510
Our power plant will
bring about change.

393
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,085
But one needs money
to make the plant.

394
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:02,009
Exactly! One needs
money to make the plant..

395
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,835
Not the plant to make money!

396
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,005
"He is stealthily coming.."

397
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:19,089
" home at midnight."

398
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,005
"He has been passing.."

399
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:27,509
"by my alley daily."

400
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:34,004
"The setting sun is
giving its colours to me."

401
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:37,917
No matter how many millions we make,
one day we will all be gone.

402
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:40,841
But the power plant and the
change it brings about will stay on.

403
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,425
The power plant is a thought.

404
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,343
Men die, but their
thoughts live forever!

405
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:52,502
What was the biggest and most
difficult decision of your life?

406
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:58,420
"So many hues.."

407
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,752
To kill my brother.

408
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,085
He loved me very much.

409
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,835
He could do anything for me.

410
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,094
I overlooked all his mistakes.

411
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,839
But the attack on dad..

412
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:40,503
I'm talking about change, but
I couldn't change my brother.

413
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,502
For dad, it's all about the money.

414
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,510
He only thinks about money.

415
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,173
After my mom's death,
we drifted apart.

416
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,005
He took me into his business..

417
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:13,508
But he is more of
a boss than a father.

418
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,344
I'm very happy about
this power plant project.

419
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,006
I will work on my own terms.

420
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:38,260
I finally get to do what I want.

421
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:45,419
Shankar, that idiot Sanjay Somji
is provoking people against you.

422
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:50,089
Mr. Rao, what am I
hearing about Somji?

423
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,754
It is not that Somji
doesn't listen to me.

424
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,169
He takes me as his principal.

425
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:03,586
But.. I don't know what his
problem in this matter is.

426
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,083
You tell me..
Subhash, what can I do?

427
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:11,338
Sons are born to
disgrace their ancestors.

428
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,504
Forget these city fools!

429
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,011
They will make the land
of Thakarvvadi go barren.

430
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:19,506
This power plant is a farce.

431
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:22,006
They will destroy your homes
to build the power plant..

432
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:25,087
And then supply the
electricity to the city.

433
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,836
You will just keep
watching it all unfold.

434
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,924
Shankar Nagre wants to cripple you!

435
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,677
Brothers and sisters!
It <i>is</i> time to be alert!

436
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,924
You want to cripple
or make him cripple?

437
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,002
Shankar Nagre wants to cripple you.

438
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:42,257
He wants us to sell our Motherland.

439
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:45,006
Don't be fooled by
that city-bred man.

440
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,917
He is using his father's
name to grab it.

441
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:52,011
Once you lose your land,
where will you go looking for..

442
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,006
Shankar and his fair lady?

443
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:58,593
We were poor and hungry because
of these people from the city.

444
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:07,002
If anybody tries to take away
our Motherland away from us..

445
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:09,927
We will crush them all!

446
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,834
We will not do anything else,
but we will chop them into pieces.

447
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:19,917
Down with Shankar Nagre..

448
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,835
Subhash Nagre is a thief!

449
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:36,509
Who said that?

450
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,342
Who said it?

451
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,260
- Who is a thief?
- Come out and say it at my face!

452
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,092
Sorry!

453
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,092
Let's go!

454
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,755
"They are seen in the newspapers."

455
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,006
"Mornings, they leave their home."

456
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:29,088
"They instigate everyone.."

457
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,174
"They instigate.."

458
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:37,750
"They instigate.."

459
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:52,504
"The heated paths undertaken.."

460
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:23,005
"Boundaries are drawn by courage."

461
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:29,250
"The grief of people
helps sell their hopes."

462
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,425
"They are seen in the newspapers."

463
00:42:56,333 --> 00:43:01,260
"Mornings, they leave their home."

464
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:09,172
"They instigate everyone.."

465
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,674
"They instigate everyone.."

466
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,752
“Opposition from everyone..“

467
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:24,833
- Shinde!
- Down with him!

468
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:46,004
In many parts of Maharashtra,
his supporters..

469
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:50,259
Have attacked Shankar Nagre's men,
torched cars and paralyzed traffic.

470
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:53,094
Somji has justified this violence.

471
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,003
Rural Maharashtra that once
dreamt of peace and prosperity..

472
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:59,508
Has now turned into a
political battleground.

473
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:02,917
Qazi, Qazi!

474
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,844
Sarkar is going to be
struck by lightning now.

475
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,092
Kill him!

476
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:14,418
Just be careful that
you don't get a shock.

477
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:25,426
Current lights up lamps too!

478
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:32,176
You have not become CM
just to light lamps.

479
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,835
Deputy CM.

480
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:42,752
What difference does it make?

481
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:45,340
It's just a small difference.

482
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,344
All we need is a jack to
win this game of cards!

483
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,084
And who would that be?

484
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,217
Kantilal Vora!

485
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,674
Not Vohra, Vora!

486
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:07,509
Vora!

487
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,842
Vora!

488
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,585
Vo.. Vora.

489
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:20,086
Sarkar, this is my son.
Kalpesh Vora.

490
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,672
Kantilal Vohra!

491
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:29,509
Vora!

492
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:31,509
Vora!

493
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:40,255
I'm a very frank person.

494
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,086
Sarkar, I want this
power plant to be built..

495
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:55,092
In Gujarat instead of Maharashtra.

496
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:04,591
Shares worth 50
million of Vohra industries.

497
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:06,925
Vora!

498
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Sarkar, tell your son not to
be so attached to this project..

499
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:20,011
So, you are bribing me
to go against my son?

500
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,342
This is not a bribe.

501
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:25,253
A small token of our friendship.

502
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:28,261
Every father thinks
about his son's future..

503
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:30,836
You, me..

504
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,842
Greetings, Sister-in-law.

505
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:34,259
I'm Kantilal Vora.

506
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,839
And this is my son Kalpesh Vora.

507
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,502
Sarkar, if this project..

508
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:47,675
Can we talk about something else?

509
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,425
Thanks.

510
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,506
Idli (lentil dumplings),
sambhar (lentil soup).

511
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:27,506
That Somji is not ready to talk!

512
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:30,010
Let's break his head.

513
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:36,921
Once he is disgraced in public,
he will forget politics.

514
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,425
Illiterate man!

515
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:46,093
Chandar, I want to meet Somji.

516
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:53,507
Shankar its useless
talking to the lousy uncouth!

517
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:57,588
Chandar! How many times
have I told you not to shout?

518
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:21,426
I believe he wants Maharashtra
to progress as much as I do.

519
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,423
But he is ignorant of
the change this project..

520
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,093
Is going to bring about..

521
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,919
That's why he is opposing us.

522
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:41,095
I want to make him understand
the benefits of this project.

523
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,927
If he truly cares about the people's
welfare, he will surely understand.

524
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:52,089
You just fix a meeting.

525
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,843
I visited the doctor..

526
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:21,921
After the check up,
she's asked for a blood test.

527
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,509
Why blood test?

528
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,422
Avanti, what happened?

529
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:38,501
Nothing as yet, but it
will in seven months.

530
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,926
Why doesn't anyone
ever tell me anything?

531
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,094
Sorry, Uncle.
The doctor said there would..

532
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,419
Be a delay in knowing the results.

533
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:08,921
I thought I would tell
you once it's confirmed.

534
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:11,090
You are so short tempered.

535
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,585
Scolding her over
something so trivial.

536
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:14,925
I am not..

537
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,342
Come here!

538
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:21,425
Chandar give me a
hundred rupee note.

539
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:25,759
Here..

540
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,092
And a rupee.

541
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,342
Give me your hand.

542
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,843
God bless you.

543
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:37,919
Have you thought of a name?

544
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:41,169
How does Laxmi sound for a girl?

545
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,592
It's a great name, Sarkar!

546
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:44,509
What if it's a boy?

547
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,675
Ganesh!

548
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,842
Excellent!

549
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:49,921
The priest has said if it's a
boy we should name him Vishnu..

550
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:14,838
Where did I go wrong with Vishnu?

551
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:30,006
Sometimes our principles become..

552
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:34,919
Bigger than life itself.

553
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:42,928
I know, but the responsibility
was mine. I never meant to..

554
00:52:11,917 --> 00:52:13,590
Kantilal Vora had come today.

555
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,092
I know.

556
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:21,340
Shankar, things are
not what they seem to be.

557
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:22,925
I know that too.

558
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:27,588
Shankar, that man..
Dad, I will handle it.

559
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,842
I know.

560
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,002
I'm having a small get-together..

561
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:44,508
For the people
associated with this project.

562
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:48,251
You have to come
with your family. Yes.

563
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,927
Dad, I have no
regrets over what happened.

564
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:15,585
And neither should you.

565
00:53:20,417 --> 00:53:22,169
We should forget brother Vishnu.

566
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,083
There are two rules in business.

567
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:27,760
First, never hate anyone.

568
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,425
And the second?

569
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,592
Love.

570
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:34,427
"Two lovelorn souls
roam the city streets."

571
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:36,585
"One doesn't plan for love,
it just happens!"

572
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:40,011
Shankar is in love with power.

573
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:43,917
He is playing the hero of
Thakan/vadi using Mike Rajan's money.

574
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,334
"You are my hero."

575
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:58,759
If it's so easy to be a hero,
why didn't you.. become one?

576
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,584
Monkeys create a
commotion in the state assembly.

577
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,004
People in India
don't want development..

578
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,506
They want entertainment!

579
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:16,675
What does that mean?

580
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,092
What happened?

581
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:28,756
I have an excellent idea
to solve all our problems.

582
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,592
What is it?

583
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:33,925
What?!

584
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,926
The idea has not taken shape yet.

585
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:48,257
- Ask Somji to meet me.
- Yes.

586
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,467
Shankar! Yes.

587
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,092
A call from Sanjay Somji..

588
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:09,509
Hello. - Tell me. - Somji,
I have great regard for you.

589
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:13,594
If we have the same goal then
why are we on opposite sides?

590
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:15,926
People are being misled.

591
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:20,593
They are becoming aware
of your true identity.

592
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,172
What is my true identity?

593
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:24,169
You are a fraud!

594
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:27,011
I feel ashamed that people
like you are born in Maharashtra.

595
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:29,585
You are making false
promises to my people.

596
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,217
They are my people as well.

597
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:35,085
Just meet me once,
read the project report.

598
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:39,090
If you know nothing
about the project..

599
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,416
One minute.. Listen. Can you
switch on the air-conditioner?

600
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,753
On what basis can
you say it's a loss?

601
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:13,878
The police have made
strict arrangements..

602
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:17,041
To maintain law
and order in the city.

603
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,877
Where the police is being careful..

604
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:22,711
They do not have the
answer to a question..

605
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:27,298
That if the home of the most
powerful man in the city is unsafe..

606
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,215
Then how safe are the rest of us?

607
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:34,588
The condition of the
great leader is now stable.

608
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:37,886
Sarkar suffered a
heart attack after..

609
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:40,882
The tragic death of
his daughter-in-law..

610
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:45,293
Avantika Nagre
in a bomb explosion.

611
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:47,885
It's suspected that an insider..

612
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:53,795
Could be involved
in the conspiracy.

613
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:55,460
Now the question is..

614
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,717
How did this happen?

615
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:08,503
Bala, you are in charge
of security from now on.

616
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:14,171
Shankar, what is all this?

617
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:16,547
I have made a mistake
for the first time.

618
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:21,256
In our business the first
mistake is always the last one.

619
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:25,672
I know that. Just give me a chance..

620
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,048
- I will put in my best efforts.
- I don't want efforts.

621
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,131
- I want results.
- Have I ever let you down before?

622
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,506
I don't have time to
argue over useless things.

623
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:39,172
Okay, so, now you don't have
time to listen to me too..

624
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:42,302
- Then why should I stay here any more.
- Leave.

625
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:09,086
Avantika was two months pregnant..

626
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:22,293
Did you find out who placed
the bomb? - I know..

627
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,340
I have to go to the
hospital to meet dad.

628
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:32,384
Can I come along?

629
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:58,464
Move. Move.

630
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:37,589
It was not your fault..

631
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:40,676
The responsibility was mine.

632
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:52,093
You have to pay the price if
you live on your own terms.

633
01:02:58,792 --> 01:03:00,510
Dad, I have dismissed Chandar.

634
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:08,800
There must be a good reason.

635
01:03:11,292 --> 01:03:12,384
Yes.

636
01:03:22,417 --> 01:03:25,091
And how is the project coming along?

637
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:30,218
Our site office is ready.

638
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,128
The work will begin
within three months.

639
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:26,006
In view of long term benefits..

640
01:04:28,417 --> 01:04:30,636
One has to forget
about temporary losses.

641
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:38,090
How do I forget this loss?

642
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:46,550
Tell me how.

643
01:05:04,042 --> 01:05:08,297
I have never seen such a
father-son relationship before.

644
01:05:10,792 --> 01:05:12,135
Shankar whatever happens..

645
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,462
- Do not worry about me.
- I know but..

646
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:26,672
You should never
change your thinking.

647
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:35,587
Anita, this is not the
time to think, but to act.

648
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:42,792
Intentions are always good..

649
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:45,297
They are just misunderstood.

650
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:54,175
If you are not covered enough, a fly
can get into the wrong the place?

651
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:58,090
If a fly has to get in, it will..
Nobody can stop it.

652
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:05,136
But Kantilal Vora,
I am beginning to get afraid..

653
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:07,217
Of what?

654
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:12,426
The fact that I'm not afraid.

655
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:17,548
One can't make an omelette
without breaking an egg.

656
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:23,292
It means, Shankar is the egg..

657
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:26,377
Maharashtra the omelette.

658
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:27,800
And we are the spice.

659
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:43,302
Thank you.

660
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:49,461
Sanjay Somji is leaving
Bikapur at 8 am tomorrow morning.

661
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:36,175
Leave me.

662
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:41,134
Who are you?

663
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:47,300
Catch his hand.

664
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:50,634
Move away.

665
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:01,717
Come on.

666
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:11,131
Big trouble for Shankar Nagre.

667
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:13,882
Even before Sanjay Somji
kidnap case inquiry starts..

668
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:17,383
The people already are
doubting Shankar Nagre.

669
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:18,877
How did this happen?

670
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:20,050
'This happened when..'

671
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:22,423
He was on his way to a meeting.

672
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,426
What were the security guards doing?

673
01:08:24,792 --> 01:08:27,215
Security guards are
useless in our country.

674
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:31,633
If he considers himself the Phantom
of Marathwada and refuses security..

675
01:08:31,792 --> 01:08:33,044
What are we to do?

676
01:08:33,792 --> 01:08:36,671
Leaders think of
themselves as heroes today.

677
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:40,709
Bhagat Singh. Those days have gone..

678
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,377
What is Rao sir saying?

679
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,506
Who could be responsible
for Somji's disappearance?

680
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,675
Do you suspect anybody?

681
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,127
Who should I suspect?

682
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:55,300
Shankar Nagre.

683
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:57,173
- Who? On whom?
- Shankar Nagre.

684
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:04,794
Look here, I'm just
a simple Gandhian..

685
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:08,425
Who won't indulge in
political shenanigans.

686
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:11,302
An honest man has
a thousand enemies.

687
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:17,257
Thank you for coming to Thakarvvadi
and showing your concern.

688
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:18,717
Who do you think..

689
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:29,720
Is responsible for
Somji's kidnapping?

690
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:31,464
Hassan Qazi.

691
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:37,427
He was the one who
planted the bomb in our house.

692
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:41,295
He was the one
responsible for your heart attack.

693
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:45,337
It's because of him that
Avantika is not with us any more.

694
01:09:48,792 --> 01:09:51,011
Hassan Qazi.

695
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:54,001
Shankar..

696
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:06,178
Emotions can be dangerous.

697
01:10:08,417 --> 01:10:14,299
The position we are in, with
the responsibilities we have..

698
01:10:14,542 --> 01:10:19,878
We have to be very careful not..

699
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:22,336
To take things personally.

700
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:27,175
Dad.

701
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:31,340
Everything is personal.

702
01:10:35,292 --> 01:10:36,635
Everything.

703
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:18,173
Who must have kidnapped Somji?

704
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,252
Do you think I have done it?

705
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:30,300
No..

706
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,506
But everyone else
thinks I have done it.

707
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:45,210
How do you bear all this?

708
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:48,717
I'm used to it.

709
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:54,052
Anita, I do what I think is right.

710
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:58,710
I don't care how people perceive it.

711
01:12:04,042 --> 01:12:06,636
I don't enjoy living such a life..

712
01:12:08,542 --> 01:12:09,668
Making enemies..

713
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,255
Losing my wife..

714
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:20,301
Killing my own brother.

715
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:32,173
Decisions come from circumstances.

716
01:12:38,792 --> 01:12:40,419
And now it's my decision..

717
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,128
That I will make this
power plant come what may.

718
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,877
And if Somji doesn't
understand this..

719
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:51,256
I will not kidnap him..

720
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:54,550
I will kill him.

721
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:01,632
Nobody is more important than
the progress of Maharashtra.

722
01:13:04,292 --> 01:13:08,092
Not Somji, not me.

723
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:23,259
Dad is coming..

724
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:41,217
Hi Shankar.

725
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:43,175
Glad you made it..

726
01:13:43,625 --> 01:13:45,753
My dad's here. He arrived
from London this morning.

727
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:48,381
There he is. Come.

728
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:54,002
Hi, Shankar, Anita
keeps singing your praises.

729
01:14:01,792 --> 01:14:04,636
You wanted results right?

730
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:07,131
I know where Somji is.

731
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:11,132
Hassan Qazi has kidnapped him.

732
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:14,296
"Govinda."

733
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:31,714
Anita, I don't want social reformers
who talk about the masses.

734
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:36,593
I want flexible people
like Kantilal Vora..

735
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:40,586
Does this mean you are giving
the project to Kantilal Vora?

736
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:42,465
- It's given.
- What?

737
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:47,676
But what about the promises we have
made to the people of Thakarvvadi?

738
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:50,219
Hello. Why are you
being so emotional?

739
01:14:50,292 --> 01:14:52,169
- What's wrong with you?
- Dad.

740
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:54,044
This is deception.

741
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:56,505
Don't be moralistic.

742
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,048
Business means only
one thing. Profit.

743
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:03,210
You don't understand business..

744
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,252
Don't laugh dad.

745
01:15:07,042 --> 01:15:08,885
Shankar is not like Kantilal Vora..

746
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:11,381
Who can stoop to any
level for his personal gains.

747
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:12,550
Shut up.

748
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,970
I don't want to hear
Shankar's name any more. He's out.

749
01:15:16,167 --> 01:15:18,135
Out. Out?

750
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:20,968
Shankar won't allow this.

751
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:22,134
Oh really?

752
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:24,010
We will take care of Shankar,
you don't worry.

753
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:27,086
Mr. Vora.

754
01:15:32,292 --> 01:15:34,010
Meet my daughter Anita.

755
01:15:35,625 --> 01:15:36,717
Hello my girl..

756
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:43,302
Today, Gujarat needs young and
dynamic business leaders like you.

757
01:15:44,292 --> 01:15:46,044
- What will you have?
- Whiskey?

758
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:47,675
Waiter. Whiskey.

759
01:15:48,542 --> 01:15:52,376
Anita says Shankar will
not let us work together.

760
01:15:55,792 --> 01:15:57,214
Shankar will be taken care of..

761
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:03,217
That's what I said.

762
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:06,044
Shall we talk about something else?

763
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:07,384
Yes.

764
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:20,717
I had been..

765
01:16:43,792 --> 01:16:48,047
"Govinda."

766
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,718
"Govinda."

767
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:03,875
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

768
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:10,134
Leave him.

769
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:17,001
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

770
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:23,875
"A lot of questions are.."

771
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:30,295
" being asked in the city."

772
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:36,178
"The answers to them are none."

773
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,334
Come on.

774
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:43,551
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

775
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:46,253
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

776
01:17:48,292 --> 01:17:54,004
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

777
01:18:28,792 --> 01:18:32,467
"“Govinda. Govinda. Govinda.."

778
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:44,167
"Govinda. Govinda.."

779
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:46,250
"Govinda.."

780
01:18:52,417 --> 01:18:56,467
"Govinda. Govinda.."

781
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:30,792
"Negotiation,
bribery, punishment, spying.

782
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:34,258
Negotiation, bribery, punishment,
spying."

783
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:37,587
"Negotiation, bribery,
punishment, spying.

784
01:19:37,792 --> 01:19:41,467
Negotiation, bribery,
punishment, spying."

785
01:19:50,667 --> 01:19:53,546
Yes Rao sir, he's right here..

786
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:55,294
Talk to him. One minute.

787
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,301
Talk to him, Rao sir.

788
01:20:01,417 --> 01:20:02,509
Greetings.

789
01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:06,672
Shankar, when I saw
you the first time..

790
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:14,136
I knew you had the potential
to outshine even Subhash.

791
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:21,797
And today, you have proved that you
have intelligence as well as power.

792
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:29,213
I had given up on Somji..

793
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:35,051
But you came as my Saviour.

794
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,254
You have long way to go, son.

795
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:43,675
You and he too.

796
01:20:45,542 --> 01:20:47,465
Mike Rajan,
what do you have to fear'?

797
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:50,545
You are back in the cool of London..

798
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:53,131
But the heat is
getting unbearable here.

799
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:56,049
We don't know what will
happen after Hassan Qazi..

800
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:58,127
We don't know anything.

801
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:03,550
You too..

802
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:06,300
What did he say?

803
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:10,134
Take care.

804
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,881
What do we do about Shankar?

805
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:18,084
We have to do something.

806
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:28,800
What do we do?

807
01:21:36,542 --> 01:21:37,634
What do we do?

808
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:40,301
That's what I'm asking,
what do we do?

809
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:41,672
And that's what I'm
asking too, what do we do'?

810
01:21:48,583 --> 01:21:52,213
What do we do, should we call Negi?

811
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:30,050
How much?

812
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:38,172
5 lakh.

813
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:45,877
What 5 crore?

814
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:48,632
Are you nuts?

815
01:22:48,708 --> 01:22:51,177
- Quiet.
- Are you nuts? Crore..

816
01:22:57,042 --> 01:22:58,134
How will you kill him?

817
01:23:04,542 --> 01:23:05,668
He doesn't want to tell.

818
01:23:29,417 --> 01:23:31,886
After a lot of thought
and soul searching..

819
01:23:31,958 --> 01:23:33,881
I have decided to withdraw..

820
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:37,132
Our agitation against
the Sheppard power project.

821
01:23:37,208 --> 01:23:39,381
Is it because of
Shankar Nagre's intimidation?

822
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:43,133
Not intimidation, but inspiration.

823
01:23:43,417 --> 01:23:45,010
Of Shankar's thoughts.

824
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:49,675
He explained every
aspect of this project to me.

825
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:53,799
We cannot live in
isolation any more.

826
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:59,298
We have to step into the new
world with our heads held high.

827
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:01,965
'Yes, one more question.'

828
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:04,170
Why did you agitate if
you had to back down?

829
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:08,792
I have withdrawn the agitation
for the same reason I started it.

830
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:11,958
What did you say to Somji
that made him change his mind'?

831
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:22,131
That we may think
differently but we dream alike.

832
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:25,132
That's a lie. You are all criminals.

833
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:28,633
Earlier it was just Mumbai, now you
are terrorizing the villages too.

834
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:31,712
Don't be afraid,
Somji, we are all with you.

835
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,424
Speak up Somji, we are with you.

836
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:39,630
This press conference is a sham.

837
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:40,800
Enough.

838
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,673
Its okay, let him talk..
Please continue..

839
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:47,880
Who is responsible
for the 40,000 people..

840
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:55,958
That will lose their land because
of the plant? - You are responsible.

841
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:01,802
And people like you who
have never cared about them.

842
01:25:03,292 --> 01:25:06,421
If someone wants to do something
then you ask him questions.

843
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:12,048
I don't mind you asking me
questions, that's your job.

844
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:14,880
But what hurts is that
you don't understand..

845
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:17,086
The meaning of your own questions.

846
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:19,885
Anyone here who has a
problem with this project..

847
01:25:19,958 --> 01:25:22,677
Must come to my
office and read the reports.

848
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:27,543
All your questions will be answered.

849
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:31,634
Anything else?

850
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:35,675
Thank you.

851
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:58,127
Shankar, dad and Kantilal Vora
have entered into a partnership.

852
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:02,460
The project is going to Gujarat.

853
01:26:03,042 --> 01:26:05,465
It's not going yet, they are
just trying to take it away.

854
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:11,883
Dad was saying that those people..

855
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:15,462
Will take care of you..

856
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:20,302
By offering me huge sums of money.

857
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:29,170
I don't think they are that foolish
to think they can buy you out.

858
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:30,501
What else can it be?

859
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:31,675
I don't know.

860
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:34,467
I don't know.

861
01:26:34,542 --> 01:26:36,010
But..

862
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,709
Qazi was the biggest threat,
he's out of the way.

863
01:26:46,542 --> 01:26:51,002
That leaves Somji, he's with me now.

864
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,130
That's what I'm afraid of..

865
01:26:56,625 --> 01:27:00,175
So what do you think they will do?

866
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:09,052
It troubles me the
way dad was talking..

867
01:27:13,417 --> 01:27:15,010
Anita you are overreacting.

868
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:24,049
I don't know why I'm so afraid..

869
01:27:28,792 --> 01:27:30,385
Anita, nothing will happen to me.

870
01:27:31,958 --> 01:27:35,167
You are worried about me
because you are concerned about me.

871
01:28:58,458 --> 01:28:59,550
Shankar.

872
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:08,009
Stop it.

873
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:12,217
No.

874
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:20,175
Shankar.

875
01:29:22,292 --> 01:29:23,384
Shankar.

876
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:25,050
No.

877
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:28,801
His entire spinal cord is damaged.

878
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,960
The internal bleeding
is not stopping.

879
01:30:33,292 --> 01:30:35,340
Shankar has very little time left.

880
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:08,509
There is nothing to be
worried about at all.

881
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:12,801
I just spoke to the doctor.

882
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:24,509
He says you got here just in time.

883
01:33:27,417 --> 01:33:29,590
I have faced so many attacks.

884
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:35,129
What is the meaning of a
leader if he does not get attacked?

885
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:42,051
This attack is not on
you but on your ideals.

886
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:43,801
On your ideals.

887
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:50,544
A lot of work has to be done.

888
01:33:55,292 --> 01:34:02,380
After a few days rest, you
will be absolutely fine.

889
01:34:03,542 --> 01:34:05,135
Absolutely fine.

890
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:12,213
But this time I
won't let you go alone.

891
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:17,293
I will come with you.

892
01:34:19,125 --> 01:34:21,378
You will take me along, won't you?

893
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:38,464
The doctor says you
are out of danger now.

894
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:40,967
Nothing will happen.

895
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:42,885
"What I wanted to happen."

896
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:48,676
"I can't sleep peacefully now."

897
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:52,475
No empathy, no order

898
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:04,131
"I can't sleep peacefully now."

899
01:36:05,417 --> 01:36:11,345
"I have lost my peace of mind."

900
01:36:11,792 --> 01:36:17,549
"I can't seem to find a way."

901
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:23,052
"Help me Lord Krishna."

902
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:28,711
"I can't sleep peacefully now."

903
01:36:57,917 --> 01:37:03,503
“And I can't seem to find a way.“

904
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:09,794
"I can't sleep peacefully now."

905
01:37:10,167 --> 01:37:16,129
"This age seems to be less."

906
01:37:16,542 --> 01:37:22,174
"What I wanted to happen."

907
01:37:22,542 --> 01:37:27,878
"Help me Lord Krishna."

908
01:37:28,875 --> 01:37:33,711
"I can't sleep peacefully now."

909
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:53,052
"Whatever one thinks.."

910
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:56,334
This power plant will
be made, for Shankar.

911
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,335
I will fulfill his dream.

912
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,627
I will fulfill his dream.

913
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:11,590
"He seems to be falling apart."

914
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,302
"Help me Lord Krishna."

915
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:22,884
"I can't sleep peacefully now."

916
01:38:23,583 --> 01:38:28,168
Who was with your dad
at the party that night?

917
01:38:33,167 --> 01:38:37,627
Think very carefully..

918
01:40:09,292 --> 01:40:10,544
I want Vora.

919
01:40:13,375 --> 01:40:15,127
Kantilal Vora.

920
01:40:19,625 --> 01:40:20,717
Right now.

921
01:40:20,792 --> 01:40:23,136
"Negotiation, bribe, punishment,
spying."

922
01:40:23,375 --> 01:40:31,375
"Negotiation, bribe, punishment,
spying."

923
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:39,714
"Full of troubles, where can he go?"

924
01:40:40,958 --> 01:40:48,958
- "The heart is.."
- Hey leave.

925
01:40:50,958 --> 01:40:58,547
"Goes to Sarkar for help."

926
01:41:18,625 --> 01:41:23,882
I have asked this man standing
behind you to chop off your hands..

927
01:41:23,958 --> 01:41:31,718
If you don't answer
my question immediately.

928
01:41:38,458 --> 01:41:44,875
- No..
- He will not wait..

929
01:41:44,958 --> 01:41:47,211
For my order.

930
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:59,793
Now tell me, who all were involved?

931
01:42:04,792 --> 01:42:05,964
Who did all this?

932
01:42:15,667 --> 01:42:17,544
Let me know if you have some work.

933
01:42:18,458 --> 01:42:20,677
Yes I will tell Sarkar. Yes.

934
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:24,628
Someone from Sarkar's
house is here to meet you.

935
01:42:25,083 --> 01:42:26,175
Send him in.

936
01:42:26,333 --> 01:42:27,801
Or you come to my office, here.

937
01:42:28,083 --> 01:42:29,960
Okay, that's all right. Okay, okay.

938
01:42:30,167 --> 01:42:31,293
So, Billu, how are you doing?

939
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:33,050
Sit.

940
01:42:36,042 --> 01:42:37,134
What's happening?

941
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:40,877
Even you are moving
with security these days?

942
01:42:43,167 --> 01:42:44,259
What?

943
01:42:44,875 --> 01:42:45,967
Hello.

944
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:48,548
Sarkar has come to know everything.

945
01:42:50,542 --> 01:42:51,759
What?

946
01:42:52,208 --> 01:42:53,300
About Shankar.

947
01:42:56,167 --> 01:42:59,091
What about Shankar?

948
01:42:59,167 --> 01:43:02,250
Tell me afterwards.
No, no, Billu. Let's move.

949
01:43:02,333 --> 01:43:03,550
One minute. One minute.

950
01:43:03,625 --> 01:43:07,550
Hey, move. Billu..
Billu don't do that.

951
01:43:07,625 --> 01:43:10,629
What are you doing?
Listen.. Hang on..

952
01:43:10,708 --> 01:43:14,633
Shankar.. don't do that..

953
01:43:14,708 --> 01:43:16,085
- Let him go.
- I...

954
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:20,343
Let him go..

955
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:27,387
Govinda. Govinda

956
01:43:27,792 --> 01:43:31,296
Govinda. Govinda

957
01:43:31,708 --> 01:43:35,042
Govinda. Govinda

958
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:38,879
Govinda. Govinda

959
01:43:39,417 --> 01:43:41,886
Govinda. Govinda

960
01:43:41,958 --> 01:43:46,384
Govinda. Govinda. Govinda

961
01:43:47,125 --> 01:43:52,336
Govinda. Govinda. Govinda

962
01:43:52,417 --> 01:43:53,509
I cannot believe it..

963
01:43:59,167 --> 01:44:00,885
I still can't believe that you too..

964
01:44:04,333 --> 01:44:12,333
Were involved in
Shankar's killing.

965
01:44:19,125 --> 01:44:20,217
20 years.

966
01:44:24,708 --> 01:44:26,460
I served you for 20 years.

967
01:44:28,708 --> 01:44:29,800
I was like your shadow.

968
01:44:33,625 --> 01:44:37,710
I was here with you even
when he went away to America..

969
01:44:37,875 --> 01:44:39,297
Here.

970
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:47,802
Sarkar, why did Shankar
do this to me?

971
01:44:49,292 --> 01:44:50,965
Tell me. Please make me understand.

972
01:44:51,292 --> 01:44:52,965
Why did he keep me away from you?

973
01:44:56,375 --> 01:45:00,380
He trusts these amateurs,
but not me.

974
01:45:06,958 --> 01:45:08,050
He stripped me off all my dignity.

975
01:45:09,708 --> 01:45:11,631
This is what I get in
return for my loyalty?

976
01:45:19,125 --> 01:45:20,217
Sarkar.

977
01:45:22,958 --> 01:45:24,380
Sarkar, please explain,
make me understand.

978
01:45:25,042 --> 01:45:26,635
You are my God.

979
01:45:26,875 --> 01:45:29,128
Always were, always will be.

980
01:45:32,875 --> 01:45:33,967
But Shankar..

981
01:45:41,458 --> 01:45:44,962
Am I wrong, Sarkar? Tell me.

982
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:48,051
Please explain.

983
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:49,717
Tell me, am I wrong?

984
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:51,800
Explain to me.

985
01:45:53,125 --> 01:45:56,880
What is the use of
explaining to you now..

986
01:45:56,958 --> 01:45:59,962
What you couldn't
understand in 20 years.

987
01:46:00,708 --> 01:46:01,800
Sarkar..

988
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:06,384
Sarkar..

989
01:46:08,208 --> 01:46:09,300
Yes tell me.

990
01:46:36,792 --> 01:46:39,875
A few moments ago, your father..

991
01:46:39,958 --> 01:46:44,384
Was killed in London on my orders.

992
01:46:54,292 --> 01:46:55,384
Chandar.

993
01:46:58,292 --> 01:46:59,384
Kanga.

994
01:47:02,208 --> 01:47:03,300
Vora.

995
01:47:04,292 --> 01:47:07,296
The assassin.

996
01:47:08,042 --> 01:47:09,134
All dead.

997
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:15,800
These were all pawns..

998
01:47:19,125 --> 01:47:20,217
Even Hassan Qazi..

999
01:47:21,292 --> 01:47:23,795
Each and every one of them.

1000
01:47:30,875 --> 01:47:31,967
What do you mean?

1001
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:43,881
There is a very fine line between..

1002
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:49,795
Excessive loyalty and betrayal.

1003
01:47:51,458 --> 01:47:54,086
Chandar wanted to
take my place after me..

1004
01:47:54,875 --> 01:47:56,877
Kanga was unhappy with my decision..

1005
01:47:56,958 --> 01:47:59,381
To make Shinde the CM and
wanted to topple the government.

1006
01:48:02,208 --> 01:48:05,883
And you yourself know..

1007
01:48:05,958 --> 01:48:10,134
About the greedy
Kantilal Vora and your dad.

1008
01:48:12,292 --> 01:48:15,876
The only one standing
in the way of..

1009
01:48:15,958 --> 01:48:20,134
All these people was our Shankar.

1010
01:48:23,958 --> 01:48:30,375
They used his principles
and his passion against him.

1011
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:43,881
Shankar thought that
all this was being done..

1012
01:48:43,958 --> 01:48:48,168
To make money from
the power plant.

1013
01:48:48,708 --> 01:48:55,967
My Shankar didn't realise that
the power plant was just a veil.

1014
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:59,719
An excuse, a mask..

1015
01:49:00,708 --> 01:49:06,044
Behind which a heinous political..

1016
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:12,794
One heinous trap was being set.

1017
01:49:21,875 --> 01:49:23,627
This was a big trap.

1018
01:49:30,292 --> 01:49:32,545
Conspiracy was being
plotted to topple our government.

1019
01:49:35,208 --> 01:49:36,801
To get Shankar out of the way.

1020
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:47,417
And make Somji the new
leader of Maharashtra.

1021
01:49:51,958 --> 01:49:57,636
A very big conspiracy.

1022
01:50:04,208 --> 01:50:05,300
Who planned this?

1023
01:50:07,875 --> 01:50:08,967
Rao sir.

1024
01:50:29,625 --> 01:50:33,209
Rao sir pitted Somji
against Shankar.

1025
01:50:35,083 --> 01:50:36,801
With Hassan Qazi's help..

1026
01:50:38,708 --> 01:50:40,426
He was the one who got
the bomb planted in our car.

1027
01:50:44,458 --> 01:50:46,802
He was the one who
staged Somji's kidnapping.

1028
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:51,883
It was on Rao sir's bidding..

1029
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:56,543
That Kantilal Vora and
Kanga hired the assassin.

1030
01:51:00,708 --> 01:51:02,961
And Chandar was the one..

1031
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:11,961
Who gave away
Shankar's whereabouts.

1032
01:51:16,042 --> 01:51:17,385
All these..

1033
01:51:21,542 --> 01:51:23,715
Were poisonous arrows.

1034
01:51:25,542 --> 01:51:30,878
The power plant, the bow..

1035
01:51:30,958 --> 01:51:36,965
And Rao sir the marksman.

1036
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:41,800
But Chandar was
always with Shankar..

1037
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:48,960
During the blast,
while rescuing Somji..

1038
01:51:50,875 --> 01:51:51,967
And even later..

1039
01:51:53,292 --> 01:51:55,044
To kill is a crime..

1040
01:51:57,542 --> 01:52:01,797
To kill at the
right time is politics.

1041
01:52:08,875 --> 01:52:12,880
If Shankar had died in the blast..

1042
01:52:12,958 --> 01:52:17,293
People would suspect Somji.

1043
01:52:19,958 --> 01:52:25,215
Shankar thought that after Hassan
Qazi's death Somji was with him.

1044
01:52:25,792 --> 01:52:28,875
But he didn't know..

1045
01:52:28,958 --> 01:52:35,546
That Rao sir was
setting the stage for Somji.

1046
01:52:43,292 --> 01:52:47,798
In this game of chess..

1047
01:52:51,708 --> 01:52:55,793
Rao sir played all the moves.

1048
01:52:57,792 --> 01:52:59,886
He made Somji oppose Shankar in..

1049
01:52:59,958 --> 01:53:04,338
The beginning and
support him later.

1050
01:53:16,792 --> 01:53:20,877
And when I came out,
Shankar had fallen and..

1051
01:53:20,958 --> 01:53:26,965
People considered
Somji his brother.

1052
01:53:32,375 --> 01:53:34,548
Who could lead after Shankar?

1053
01:53:57,708 --> 01:53:58,800
What now?

1054
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,219
Rao sir is coming
here in the morning..

1055
01:54:08,708 --> 01:54:13,043
To pay tribute to Shankar.

1056
01:55:41,625 --> 01:55:45,209
I was shattered to
hear about Shankar.

1057
01:55:47,708 --> 01:55:50,177
How can we stoop so low?

1058
01:55:51,875 --> 01:55:54,003
Such degradation of politics.

1059
01:55:55,958 --> 01:55:57,426
What has gone wrong with this world?

1060
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:07,051
Shankar was the guiding star.

1061
01:56:08,292 --> 01:56:13,970
Can anyone ever
take Shankar's place?

1062
01:56:15,708 --> 01:56:18,211
Is there anyone like him?

1063
01:56:20,292 --> 01:56:21,384
Who is there to take his place?

1064
01:56:48,875 --> 01:56:49,967
What do I do with this guy?

1065
01:56:53,542 --> 01:56:54,634
What do I do.

1066
01:57:00,208 --> 01:57:01,801
What do I do with this guy?

1067
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:11,300
I need time..

1068
01:57:16,708 --> 01:57:17,960
I need time to think.

1069
01:57:25,458 --> 01:57:26,550
Take him away.

1070
01:57:55,958 --> 01:57:57,505
All my life..

1071
01:58:01,375 --> 01:58:05,960
I did what I thought was right.

1072
01:58:10,708 --> 01:58:16,636
I always lived on my own terms.

1073
01:58:24,375 --> 01:58:25,797
I have never been afraid of anyone.

1074
01:58:30,125 --> 01:58:31,217
Never.

1075
01:58:41,125 --> 01:58:45,881
But if I knew that you will be..

1076
01:58:45,958 --> 01:58:51,715
Punished for my actions..

1077
01:58:56,125 --> 01:58:59,880
Perhaps I would do..

1078
01:58:59,958 --> 01:59:03,542
Things differently.

1079
01:59:15,583 --> 01:59:17,460
For whom have I done this?

1080
01:59:22,042 --> 01:59:24,511
Who do I have with me now?

1081
01:59:30,375 --> 01:59:31,627
Vishnu is gone.

1082
01:59:33,292 --> 01:59:38,378
Chikoo, Amrita,
my daughter Avantika..

1083
01:59:45,375 --> 01:59:48,049
I couldn't stop
anyone from leaving.

1084
01:59:56,375 --> 01:59:58,375
And now you.

1085
02:00:09,542 --> 02:00:10,634
You too have gone away.

1086
02:00:23,875 --> 02:00:25,877
With every breath I take..

1087
02:00:25,958 --> 02:00:29,883
I will live..

1088
02:00:29,958 --> 02:00:33,713
In your regret..

1089
02:00:44,375 --> 02:00:45,718
Forever.

1090
02:01:43,625 --> 02:01:45,002
Pushpa, I want Chikoo here.

1091
02:01:47,542 --> 02:01:51,718
Call Amrita, tell her to send
him here immediately from Nagpur.

1092
02:01:54,958 --> 02:01:58,383
Call Shinde,
tell him to come at once.

1093
02:01:59,792 --> 02:02:00,884
Sarkar, Radhaji is here..

1094
02:02:25,958 --> 02:02:27,050
Get me some tea.

1095
02:02:27,125 --> 02:02:33,542
"“Govinda. Govinda. Govinda.."

1096
02:02:34,875 --> 02:02:41,292
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

1097
02:02:42,167 --> 02:02:50,167
"A lot of questions are
being asked in the city."

1098
02:02:51,625 --> 02:02:55,209
"Questions."

1099
02:02:55,292 --> 02:03:00,298
"And there are no
answers to those."

1100
02:03:01,458 --> 02:03:06,458
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

1101
02:03:12,875 --> 02:03:17,875
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

1102
02:03:27,083 --> 02:03:28,209
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

1103
02:03:28,292 --> 02:03:34,345
"One shouldn't be
worried about criticism."

1104
02:03:34,417 --> 02:03:40,379
"Destiny is about varied
thoughts and varied troubles."

1105
02:03:40,458 --> 02:03:46,716
"Respected are the thoughts,
infinite are his ways."

1106
02:03:46,792 --> 02:03:53,550
"What we choose and we
don't is predestined."

1107
02:03:53,625 --> 02:03:58,625
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

1108
02:04:10,458 --> 02:04:15,458
"Negotiation, bribery, punishment,
spying."

1109
02:04:25,708 --> 02:04:33,047
"Who does an anguished
soul turn to?"

1110
02:04:33,375 --> 02:04:41,375
"Who does an anguished
soul turn to?"

1111
02:04:42,542 --> 02:04:43,964
"Negotiation, bribery, punishment,
spying."

1112
02:04:44,042 --> 02:04:51,631
"He turns to Sarkar for help."

1113
02:04:51,708 --> 02:04:57,465
"Negotiation, bribery, punishment,
spying."

1114
02:04:59,625 --> 02:05:03,550
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

1115
02:05:05,625 --> 02:05:10,625
"Govinda. Govinda. Govinda."

1116
02:05:16,458 --> 02:05:17,960
"Negotiation, bribery, punishment,
spying."

1117
02:05:18,042 --> 02:05:24,300
"Sarkar is an ideology.."

1118
02:05:24,375 --> 02:05:29,461
" who neither knows
nor cares for rules."
