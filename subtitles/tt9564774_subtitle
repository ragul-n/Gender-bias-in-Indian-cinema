[wedding percussions and chants]

2
00:01:56,142 --> 00:01:57,059
What's with you, brother in law?

3
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:57,921
Being so wealthy...

4
00:01:58,121 --> 00:01:59,655
...you're getting your 
daughter married in a temple?

5
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:00,555
Stop it...

6
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:03,892
Do you think these people are getting 
married here because they can't afford it?

7
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:04,641
Then?

8
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,705
This is the auspicious time 
fixed by Mr Ram Narayana.

9
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:10,958
There is a belief here that the marriages 
under his blessings would last forever.

10
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:13,209
Are you talking about the 
astrologer Mr Ram Narayana?

11
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:13,913
Of course!

12
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:31,090
Marriage is not only a union 
of two hearts and two lives

13
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:33,277
but two horoscopes should match as well.

14
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,809
The Muhurta of the marriage 
should be appropriate too.

15
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:41,226
With the profound blessing 
of Lord Bhimeshwara Swamy,

16
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:45,594
I wish that you are all 
blessed with joy and progeny.

[wedding percussions and chants]

18
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:09,234
He is a great man who can read the lines 
on the palm and predict future aptly.

19
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,942
He has never gone wrong, brother-in-law

20
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:13,426
But unfortunately,

21
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:15,365
-in case of his his daughter's marriage... 
-Brother in law...

22
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:22,900
Let's go.

Boo...

26
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:36,513
Not boo, dear... 
Say, 'mama'... say 'Maama...'

27
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:39,309
Why're you forcing him to say it of 
your affection for your younger brother?

28
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:42,267
He can't even say 'amma'(mom) properly. 
How do you expect him to say mama?

29
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:43,427
Yeah... Yeah...

30
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:47,164
If my younger brother wouldn't have helped 
us get married against my father wish,

31
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,598
you wouldn't have had this wife or a son.

32
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:51,461
By the way, when is your brother 
getting posted in the army?

33
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:52,809
Next week...

34
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,065
His posting is in Rajasthan!

35
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,225
So madam's family was 
against your marriage?

36
00:03:58,459 --> 00:03:59,517
Is it a caste problem?

37
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:00,309
No!

38
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:02,556
Then, it must be property issues, madam.

39
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:03,880
No, not even that.

40
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,477
Then, what else madam?

41
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:07,622
Our horoscopes did not match.

42
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:13,143
There was a prediction that even if 
we get married by going against them,

43
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:16,307
we'd die within the time our baby turns 
a year old. So my father was against it.

44
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:17,317
Understood, ma'am.

45
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:21,036
Your son has turned one and 
nothing terrible had happened to you.

46
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:24,924
You are here to tell this to your father 
and he would be happy to see his grandson.

47
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:25,793
Am I right?

48
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,887
100% true!

49
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:29,189
But he didn't turn one yet.

50
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:30,309
Oh, he didn't turn yet?

51
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:31,992
-Tomorrow is his first birthday. 
-Hmm...

52
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:33,717

Wait!

58
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:21,726
Even the baby born out of such a marriage 
wouldn't have a proper horoscope.

How can we leave a baby like an orphan?

62
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:41,076
It is not about leaving him. 
It is better to get rid of him forever.

63
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:46,701
Hand him over to his 
paternal grandparents.

64
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:51,076
Hey, make all arrangements 
for the cremation ceremony.

65

Do not touch him.

71
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,071
-His horoscope has... 
-Father...

72
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:20,202
You believe that God has 
the power to write our fate.

73
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:25,825
But I believe that human love 
has the power to rewrite that fate.

74
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:32,043
He is my nephew and he will stay with me.

75
00:07:32,964 --> 00:07:35,517
But it is up to you if I 
should stay with you or not.

We have come here to take 
our grandchild along with us to London.

81
00:09:47,475 --> 00:09:48,674
He won't leave anywhere.

82
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:53,330
But if you want to stay with him, come to 
my home. You can live with us together.

-What's your name?

Don't move, else we will shoot you.

103

-What is in the bag?

-Come on! 
-Put the bag down.

106
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:24,037
Put the bag down

107
00:12:34,642 --> 00:12:37,474
I will interrogate him and report 
to you by evening, sir. Okay, sir.

108
00:12:41,242 --> 00:12:43,191
-Did he tell anything? 
-He said he is from Telugu state, sir!

109

Hmm...

110
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:46,942
Is this what you got out of him 
after two hours of interrogation?

111
00:12:47,242 --> 00:12:48,934
We are getting enquired 
about him in his hometown, sir.

112
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,659
We will get the report in 
another half an hour, sir.

Sir!

118
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:26,605
He is my nephew, sir. 
I have come here for my nephew.

119
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,767
What is the connection 
between this map and your nephew?

120
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,523
He is here in the military, sir.

121
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,492
Name?

-Don't know, sir!

00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,093
-Which regiment? 
-Don't know, sir.

126
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:37,815
Which rank?

127
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:40,606
Did he intimate and come here, 
for me to know those details, sir?

128
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,665
He has come here without any intimation.

129
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:47,851
It has been three years 
since I have seen him.

130
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:48,795
Got it.

131
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:54,162
So you've marked all the locations 
of army areas and came here...

132
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:55,426
...searching each location?

133
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:57,726
Yes, sir.

134
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,484
Do you think I'm a fool 
to believe your story?

135
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:01,574
Sir... Sir... Sir... 
Please don't scare him like that.

136
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,775
Can you see fear in his eyes?

137
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,099
Who is his nephew?

138
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,195
Why did he come to the 
army without informing anyone?

139
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:18,267
And, why did this guy come 
searching for him after three years?

140
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:21,433
I need to know all those 
details. Record the statement!

Thank you so much. But I'm sorry.

146
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:36,083
For what?

147
00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:40,208
I don't need this job. 
I'm rejecting this offer.

148
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:42,288
Why did you attend the interview 
when you aren't interested in the job?

149
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:44,263
My uncle worked very hard 
for my education, sir.

150
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:46,374
I wanted to know if it 
had gotten into my mind.

151
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:48,903
Very well indeed! 
Thank you. I'll take leave.

you are giving up for your uncle?

I don't want the future that comes 
by letting go of my uncle, sir.

00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:26,797
"You are my courage and army, Venky Mama"

174
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:59,128
"This world I saw 
sitting on your shoulder"

175
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:02,439
"is so beautiful for me"

176
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:06,004
"The time when I walked with you"

177
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,306
"taught me the lesson of victory"

178
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:12,783
"What might be the 
virtuous deeds of my feet,"

179
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,304
"it is playing on your warm chest"

180
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:19,626
"With the right of my blood relationship"

181
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:23,305
"every attribute of 
mine seems just like you"

182
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:27,225
"You are my mother and father, Venky Mama"

183
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:34,100
"You are my courage and army, Venky Mama"

184
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,646
"Listen up, all my sisters..."

185
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:05,742
"Look here, handsome guys have arrived"

186
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:08,973
"Like excitement and 
alacrity coming together"

187
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,067
"Uncle and his nephew have 
come and the fair is lit up"

188
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:15,217
"Watching both of them walk side by side,"

189
00:18:15,317 --> 00:18:18,314
"the eyes shall forget to blink"

190
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,518
"It becomes colourful, wherever they are"

191
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:24,668
"When they sport Lungis and arrive 
on a dance floor, they'd rock it "

192
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,116
"Seetha sister..."

193
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,140
"Geetha sister..."

194
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,350
"Wow! Both of them are very competitive"

195
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,683
"They are very delightful guys who 
would entertain the entire village"

196
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:47,234
"They are maternal uncle 
and nephew by relation"

197
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:50,251
"But if you put their age aside, 
they are very naughty kids"

198
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:51,282
"Venky Mama"

199
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:54,853
"Venky Mama"

200
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:58,831
[people cheering]

201
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,590
How's the fish stew?

202
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,804
It is very delicious, Lakshmi!

203
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:12,840
Lakshmi!

204
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:15,876
You know Mr Raghavayya of 
Vijayanagaram, don't you?

205
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:18,936
He is setting up a factory in Chennai.

206
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,977
He told me that a 
manager post is vacant there.

207
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:24,593
There is Raju in our village. I think it 
would better if we offer this job to him.

208
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:27,638
His mother is depressed that he is roaming 
around idle despite having a degree.

209
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:32,826
First, think about the one beside 
him, who is sitting idle without a job.

210
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:35,279
Huh!

211
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:38,497
He has neither a job 
nor a hope of getting it.

212
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:41,642
What should I do if my planets 
do not cooperate, Lakshmi?

213
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:45,029
If it is in my fate that I won't get the 
job, I won't get it no matter what I do.

214
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,035
But if it is otherwise, 
then I need not do anything.

215
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:48,850
Yeah!

216
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,667
I can simply relax and be chilled.

217
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:51,565
Hmm...

218
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,130
Isn't it, grandpa?

219
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,767
First tell him not to 
call me as 'grandpa'.

220
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:57,853
Because of my son's determination,

221
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:00,138
I gave shelter to an orphan.

222
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:04,515
And there is no other 
relationship beyond that.

223
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:09,546
Tell him that I'm giving 
him one month time.

224
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:12,563
He should find a job and leave this house.

225
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,684
Otherwise, I will throw 
him out of the house.

226
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:18,408
Hey... Hey...

227
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,216
Why are you washing your hands in the 
plate you are eating, for grandpa's words?

228
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,522
I am just drinking some 
water, not washing hands.

229
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,069
Oh!

230
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:26,134
Give grandpa a glass of 
buttermilk, he will cool down

231
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,339
One glass won't suffice, uncle.

232
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:29,429
-Give him in a pot. 
-Hey, hey...

233
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:33,422
Venky singing: "You've got the 
glow of the wedding, baby!"

234
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:34,820
-Mother 
-Yes.

235
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,344
You know I've been to saree function of 
my friend Prakash's daughter recently.

236
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,497
-I really loved something there! 
-Aah!

237
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,462
Oh dear! What a good news you've told me!

238
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,739
Tell me who that girl is! I will go with 
your father and talk to her parents.

239
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:45,715
Hello... Hello... Hello...

240
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:47,202
I am not talking about a girl.

241
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:47,839
Then?

242
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:48,672
Chalividi (Rice flour sweet)

243
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,739
Chalividi (Rice flour sweet)?

244
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:50,614
Yes, Chalividi.

245
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:52,328
I'm talking about the customary 
sweet in traditional ceremonies

246
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:54,030
I want you to prepare 
it so that I'll have it.

247
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,138
Sure, son.

248
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:56,430
I'll prepare it tomorrow.

249
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,343
-Go and sleep for today. 
-That's it!

250
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:01,260
You sing songs about marriage 
but you won't get married.

251
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:03,948
Why are you muttering 
to yourself, Lakshmi?

252
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,234
Did Grandpa deny a kiss 
citing inauspicious time?

253
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:08,377
Hey! You have no dearth of sarcasm!

254
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:11,006
All those guys of your 
Uncle's age are married.

255
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:13,125
Even their kids attained the wedding age.

256
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,047
But this guy doesn't seem 
to even think about it!

257
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:17,026
Come on! He never said no to marriage.

258
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:20,108
It is you who haven't 
looked for the right girl.

259
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,631
Yeah, your Uncle keeps saying that to you.

260
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:24,905
Do you even know how many 
matrimonial alliances we've got for him?

261
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:29,181
MATCHMAKING 1: 
Hey... look here... Look at your uncle.

262
00:21:29,406 --> 00:21:30,505
Grandma! 
[baby babbles]

263
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,221
Stop playing with the kid

264
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,429
and tell us whether 
you have liked my granddaughter or not.

265
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:36,928
Do you know how to wash the rear?

266
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:37,598
Ah!

267
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:38,285
Ah!

268
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,048
I'm talking of this kid's rear!

269
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:40,948
Grandma!

270
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:43,715
Why should my granddaughter wash his rear?

271
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:46,199
Then, I don't want her. We would do 
it ourselves. Let's go, mother.

272
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:50,658
MATCHMAKING 2: 
I like you a lot!

273
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,298
Our opinions match too.

274
00:21:53,923 --> 00:21:58,326
I will let my father know that 
I'm good to get married to you.

275
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,247
Okay.

276
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:04,172
Oh! 
Everyone will see, it wouldn't be nice.

277
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:05,569
Just a moment, 
I will take my pants off!

278
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:06,998
Ah! Pants?

279
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:09,554
Yes, pants! 
See how he wetted his pants. Hey!

280
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:12,622
How can you wipe his mouth with 
my saree worth one lakh rupees?

281
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:14,788
Is your saree more important than him?

282
00:22:14,888 --> 00:22:17,988
Mother! Throw one lakh rupees on her face.

283
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:19,583
Let's go, my nephew. 
We shall look for another girl.

284
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:24,422
MATCHMAKING 3: 
I will be very lucky if I can be your wife

285
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:25,585
But,

286
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:30,820
living together with your 
nephew might bring uninvited trouble.

287
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:35,190
There is a good hostel in 
the town with all facilities.

288
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:39,673
We can meet him every week. We can 
bring him home during every festival.

289
00:22:40,297 --> 00:22:42,096
Who gave you such a fabulous idea?

290
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:43,209
It was me, son-in-law!

291
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:44,506
Can I pluck one snake gourd?

292
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:46,862
Why not son-in-law, 
everything along with the girl is yours!

293
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:47,551
Very good.

294
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:48,653
Aah!

295
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:51,490
How dare you hit my father?

296
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:53,111
Remember one thing.

297
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:55,391
You might get any girl to be your wife,

298
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:56,786
but she can't be a 
mother to your nephew.

299
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:09,099
He didn't want a wife who 
couldn't be your mother.

300
00:23:09,381 --> 00:23:13,923
So he even gave up his military job, 
to look after you, as you are his world.

301
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:28,131
From this moment on, 
your marriage is my responsibility, uncle.

302
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:30,888
[temple bell rings]

303
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:34,429
Uncle shouldn't know that we're going 
to Rajahmundry to look for a bride

304
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:35,101
Okay, dude.

305
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:38,438
I should see my uncle in 
wedding attire within three months.

306
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:39,974
Why do you want to wait 
for 3 months, dude?

307
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,813
If you tell our tailor, he 
will stitch them by the evening.

308
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:43,765
Hey, stop your poor satires!

309
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:45,549
Did you inform all the marriage brokers?

310
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:47,570
Yes, I have informed all the brokers 
available in the Godavari district.

311
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,971
They are waiting for us at 
the other side of the river.

312
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:50,702
Then, who are these idiots waiting for?

313
00:23:50,902 --> 00:23:52,985
The MLA's daughter is visiting 
our place for the first time.

314
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:54,006
Harika is coming?

315
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:57,432
How did you promptly say her 
name? Do you know her already?

316
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:05,225
Why is she coming?

317
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:08,756
To film a documentary for 
her father's election campaign.

318
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,250
Hey, why have we come to 
your boyfriend's place?

319
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,614
Shut up... He is my ex, not my boyfriend.

320
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:55,926
He is living in the town 
which we are visiting.

321
00:24:56,126 --> 00:24:57,349
Hey, start the percussions! 
[percussions]

322
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,698
[percussions] 
Our Madam has arrived

323
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,547
Madam, give the luggage 
to him. You come along...

324
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:04,601
[fireworks crackling]

325
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:11,431
Does that mean you know 
each other in college, dude?

326
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:12,381
Do you really need to know now?

327
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,506
-Ow...  
-Will you behave like this again?

328
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:15,709
Tell me?

329
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:19,189
Don't beg like this anymore.

330
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:21,631
I have to see you in a 
school uniform from tomorrow.

331
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:22,939
Understood?

332
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:27,130
Oh no! The teacher hits me at school.

333
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:30,126
I am a new teacher and 
I don't hit children.

334
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:32,884
I will pay the fees. Just attend school.

335
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:34,879
-Okay, teacher! 
-Good boy!

336
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:37,399
This girl's character seems 
just right for my uncle!

337
00:25:38,898 --> 00:25:40,464
Are you married?

338
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:41,876
Huh?

339
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,580
Are you married?

340
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,780
Usually, people ask for their 
name on their first meeting.

341
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,822
Why are you asking me if I am married?

342
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:50,337
Alright, what is your name?

343
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:51,654
Vennela...

344
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:53,690
-Ms. Vennela, are you married?-Hey!

345
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,351
Who are you? How can you ask 
such questions to ladies?

346
00:25:55,377 --> 00:25:57,422
Alright, then, I shall 
ask you. Is she married?

347
00:25:57,506 --> 00:25:59,169
Why are you bothered 
about her personal details?

348
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:00,437
Well, who are you?

349
00:26:00,537 --> 00:26:01,622
-I am her father. 
-Oh!

350
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:03,052
Super! Do you have a son-in-law?

351
00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:04,010
Oh!

352
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:07,404
No, I am not married, so what?

353
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:08,996
-Oh my! 
-Hey!

354
00:26:09,196 --> 00:26:11,124
-Give me your luggage... Give it, please. 
-Hey... Hey...

355
00:26:11,224 --> 00:26:14,383
From now on, all your 
responsibilities and burden are mine.

356
00:26:14,443 --> 00:26:16,222
-We've got to go to other address? 
-I'm here. Give me the address.

357
00:26:16,382 --> 00:26:18,949
-I know, get into the vehicle. 
-Stop... Who is he?

358
00:26:21,135 --> 00:26:22,792
We got into his gaadi (vehicle) unnecessarily.

359
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:24,796
When did we get into it? He pushed us in.

360
00:26:25,422 --> 00:26:27,626
By the way, 
why is madam's language

361
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:30,127
like a half-done Hindi dubbing movie?

362
00:26:30,406 --> 00:26:32,155
I am a Telugu guy, 
but her mother is a Bengali.

363
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:33,540
-Is it a live-in? 
-Ah!

364
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:34,291
Damn!

365
00:26:35,006 --> 00:26:35,964
I got married to her.

366
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:37,886
There is a change in the plan, 
all of you get down.

367
00:26:38,086 --> 00:26:39,827
Dude, Broker Bujjigadu has 
sent the photo of a girl.

368
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,144
Her age is 34 and 
her height is 5'4.

369
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:46,285
Hey, we don't need them anymore.

370
00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:47,901
Put a message to him saying 
'don't send anymore'.

371
00:26:48,214 --> 00:26:50,667
Dude, just look at the image. He said 
he would make it work if you select.

372
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:52,164
I have already selected one.

373
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,004
-I am going to set it. 
-Who is it?

374
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:00,176
I got it. Keep going!

375
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:05,255
Singing: "She was reluctant 
but came to Lord Rama's temple"

376
00:27:05,631 --> 00:27:07,505
Hey, there should be a cable 
connection set by tomorrow.

377
00:27:07,705 --> 00:27:08,944
There shouldn't be 
disturbance in the picture.

378
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:10,905
Nookalamma should come in 
for housework without any fuss.

379
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,185
The newspaper should be here by 5 am.

380
00:27:12,385 --> 00:27:13,159
Which should contain no news?

381
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,826
No, there should be no 
nuisance with the newspaper guy!

382
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:17,469
Boys, you shouldn't be 
here if we have to go inside.

383
00:27:18,214 --> 00:27:19,134
Excuse me, teacher.

384
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:23,664
Apply talcum powder, drape a silk saree 
sporting jasmine flowers in your hair,

385
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:24,907
and come to my friend's sugarcane grove.

386
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:27,214
Hey... Hey... What are you talking?

387
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:28,340
As your uncle will be at the grove.

388
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,500
If he sees the teacher, 
the match can be settled.

389
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:30,906
Why is he asking me to come 
there with flowers in my hair?

390
00:27:30,924 --> 00:27:33,798
No! Not in the hair... 
He meant 'holding them'!

391
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,149
Since you have just shifted,

392
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,518
there's a Goddess temple near the grove.

393
00:27:36,718 --> 00:27:39,065
He meant it's good if you pay a visit.

394
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:39,995
That is all about it!

395
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:42,369
I shall take leave for now...

396
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:46,002
Why are delaying it, dude? The matter can 
be settled if your uncle meets the teacher

397
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:49,029
Hey, there can be a personality 
of Sunny Leone or Suryakantham

398
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:50,154
in a person who looks like Savitri!

399
00:27:50,354 --> 00:27:53,655
First, we have to check if suits 
suits my uncles' character and glamour.

400
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,083
-You are super, buddy! 
-Come, let's go.

401
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:03,434
I have got 130 acres of fertile land 
transferred to your name, brother-in-law.

402
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:08,301
It is all good, but what are 
these bloodstains on the paper?

403
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,317
Anyone might think that I 
have grabbed them forcefully.

404
00:28:12,614 --> 00:28:14,098
On top of it, its election time.

405
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,922
By the way...

406
00:28:17,135 --> 00:28:19,035
the permission for your beer 
factory has been granted.

407
00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:20,151
Yeah!

408
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:24,199
[snaps]

409
00:28:25,923 --> 00:28:28,564
He is used to giving lessons standing.

410
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:30,108
Tell me..

411
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,763
Three hundred children, sir.

412
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:34,580
They are attending school 
while living in a hostel there.

413
00:28:35,064 --> 00:28:37,245
What will happen to the 
education of the children

414
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,139
if you build a beer factory there?

415
00:28:39,573 --> 00:28:41,626
Please reconsider it, sir.

416
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:44,905
Why do you beat around the bush by 
citing about children's education?

417
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,634
You are worried about your job!

418
00:28:49,236 --> 00:28:54,021
Hey, get a job of counting the bottles 
in the beer factory, to this master.

419
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:56,172
Though he teaches Telugu 
language, he is good at Mathematics.

420
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:57,372
[people laughing]

421
00:28:57,772 --> 00:29:00,131
This is called 'Bumper offer' in English.

422
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:04,579
You settle things so well, sir.

423
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:05,779
[tyres screech]

424
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,249
Hey, what's this hurry?

425
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:10,691
The cups are going to 
break in a few minutes, sir.

426
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,004
Why would cups break, you idiot?

427
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:13,199
Just wait, you will get to know.

428
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:15,071
Crazy fellow! Why will the cups break?

429
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:53,155
Why did Mr Military Naidu come here?

430
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:55,573
The master might have 
asked for some help, sir.

431
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:56,832
I swear on the beer bottle,

432
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,105
I'll build the beer factory by all means,

433
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:00,235
no matter whoever tries to 
stop it, brother-in-law.

434
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:02,747
Come again!

435
00:30:02,998 --> 00:30:05,323
Hey, can't you hear? How 
many times should it be told?

436
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:08,356
He will build the beer factory by all 
means, no matter whoever tries to stop it.

437
00:30:22,898 --> 00:30:25,636
My uncle asked to repeat it 
not because he couldn't hear.

438
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:28,929
He asked so that you can buy some 
time to rectify your mistake.

439
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:34,206
It this repeats again, 
you will suffer the same consequence.

440
00:30:34,406 --> 00:30:35,345
What are you looking at?

441
00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:38,555
[shatters]

442
00:30:46,664 --> 00:30:48,315
[shatters]

443
00:30:58,131 --> 00:30:59,048
-Hey 
-You wait...

444
00:31:00,397 --> 00:31:01,625
Mr Military Naidu,

445
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:04,905
when the master came here and told me 
the problem, I said I would solve it.

446
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:08,672
Since he is a Telugu master, he got 
confused when I told him in English.

447
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:11,530
This is called 
miscommunication in English.

448
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:13,645
It's my promise that the 
school would remain there.

449
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:17,558
If you try to fiddle with the kids future, 
you will have no future to see.

450
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:19,043
And that is my promise.

451
00:31:29,547 --> 00:31:30,766
Why did you just leave them 
like that, brother-in-law?

452
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:34,661
Hello! We did not let them go! 
It is them who spared us and left.

453
00:31:37,214 --> 00:31:40,964
Going against him is like going 
against all the 14 villages!

454
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:44,008
We'll look into it after the elections.

455
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:47,233
Do you have the questions ready 
to test the teacher, dude?

456
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,474
All the questions are ready. 
We will test her tomorrow.

457
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,139
It is so disgusting to 
see you jogging in a Lungi.

458
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:52,967
It would more disgusting if 
I don't wear at least this.

459
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:53,525
Drat!

460
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:12,347
Ow!

461
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:16,072
Where are they going 
with water in the mugs?

462
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,668
The reason for all this is her father.

463
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:20,155
-Isn't it? 
-Yeah... Of course... Of course...

464
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:22,663
It's 'watering plants' scheme similar to 
the government's scheme 'food for work'.

465
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,618
All these are the deeds 
of our MLA Mr Pasupathy.

466
00:32:25,116 --> 00:32:25,728
Really?

467
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:29,396
-Actually, they are going to... 
-Hey... Tell her...

468
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:33,592
-Ask her to go and check if she wants to. 
-Go and check.

469
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:34,564
Harika, I will just go and check

470
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,255
Should we tell this too?

471
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:37,581
Hey, leader of mug holders,

472
00:32:37,773 --> 00:32:39,135
What is the reason behind

473
00:32:39,295 --> 00:32:40,707
all the villagers going together 
carrying water in those mugs?

474
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:43,113
Who else can it be, 
it is our MLA Mr Pasupathy.

475
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:45,878
He is right... He is right! Come on!

476
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:46,550
Super!

477
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,589
If schemes like these are highlighted, 
then my father will be in the limelight.

478
00:32:50,592 --> 00:32:51,612
-Let's go 
-Madam...

479
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:53,164
Where are you going, my dear?

480
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,587
By the way, don't you want to 
know the name of this scheme?

481
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:59,839
The name is 'Hold a mug in hand, 
tuck up the lungi and manure the field.'

482
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,591
There is intensity and 
emotion in these people.

483
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:04,953
-Their walking has enthusiasm... 
-What's this headache in the morning?

484
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:06,301
Bro... I love this emotion.

485
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:08,269
-Bro... I love this emotion. 
-Please try to understand, madam.

486
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,105
-Go away... 
-Bro, wait... I'll come too... Bro...

487
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:14,106
Hello madam, watering the plants 
is not the reason they are going.

488
00:33:14,273 --> 00:33:16,239
Hey! Just shut your mouth.

489
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:19,048
They aren't going for watering the plants.

490
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:20,562
It means...

491
00:33:20,862 --> 00:33:21,539
Hey, wait...

492
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:22,688
Start it.

493
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,226
Hey if you move away, 
we will mind our business here.

494
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:28,990
No... No... I have to witness 
it and show this to the world.

495
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,556
Hey, she tells she wants 
to show this to the world!

496
00:33:30,756 --> 00:33:34,214
You've told earlier it was your 
MLA who was the reason behind this.

497
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:36,927
Tell the same with the same feeling.

498
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:39,728
I will take footage in low 
angle for just two minutes.

499
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:40,639
Begin.

500
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:41,771
It is difficult to do it while standing

501
00:33:41,971 --> 00:33:45,435
Sit and do it. 
Your comfort is my priority.

502
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:47,515
-Come, start it. 
-Damn it!

503
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,408
Hey... Hey...

504
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:51,604
Oh no!

505
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,175
Oh my God!

506
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:59,891
I came here to take a documentary, 
but you guys have shown me a horror film.

507
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:03,798
We are in this situation as our MLA 
has gulped up the sanitation funds.

508
00:34:04,397 --> 00:34:06,438
You went to capture the 
emotion of the villagers

509
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,554
-and you've captured their 'motion'. 
-Madam... Madam...

510
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:11,447
Can you please warp this 
fun bucket programme?

511
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:13,034
I'm already very tensed.

512
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:13,740
Why are you so tensed?

513
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,574
-The thing is... 
-Since...

514
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,874
...this field belongs 
to Mr Venkatarathnam,

515
00:34:15,935 --> 00:34:17,794
so he is scared that he might arrive.

516
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:20,865
Who is Venkataratnam and why are 
you scared that he will come?

517
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:23,415
-Because I don't want him to see you. 
-Why?

518
00:34:23,614 --> 00:34:24,948
What can I say?

519
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:30,159
Venkatrathnam needs traditional wear to 
go out and two women in his bed, at night.

520
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,031
Oh, you are telling lies on 
him because of your grudge.

521
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:33,731
If he likes some girl,

522
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:38,068
be it an unmarried or married 
woman, he would have her in his bed

523
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:39,673
In unison: Oh my God! Really?

524
00:34:39,873 --> 00:34:40,873
[motorcycle approaching]

525
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,008
Hey, why am I hearing something?

526
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,780
I can even see it.

527
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:55,547
What is happening there?

528
00:34:56,714 --> 00:35:00,364
She is MLA's daughter. She wanted to 
shoot some videos, so we came to help her.

529
00:35:00,464 --> 00:35:01,255
Is it wrong?

530
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:02,638
Oh, you are Pasupathy's daughter!

531
00:35:02,738 --> 00:35:05,589
I saw you as a kid in small shorts!

532
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:09,023
Madam has grown up, but I guess the 
her short's size remained the same.

533
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,006
Yes, I am Babji, 
the broker who deals buffaloes.

534
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:12,729
Ah!

535
00:35:13,506 --> 00:35:15,240
Hey, it's Mr Venkatarathnam... Pullover.

536
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,776
Greetings, Mr Venkatarathnam.

537
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:19,923
Hey Babji, how is your business?

538
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:21,255
It's all good with your blessings.

539
00:35:21,464 --> 00:35:23,798
I have sent you Lakshmi 
recently. How is she?

540
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,297
Who's this Lakshmi?

541
00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:28,255
He is a broker who deals 
girls and this guy is his customer.

542
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:32,006
Lakshmi is all good. 
She became Soodidha(pregnant) recently.

543
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,114
What is 'Soodidha'?

544
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,014
'Soodidha' means getting pregnant. 
It the code language of the village.

545
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:38,714
Everything is fine but it is not 
letting us touch the 'Podhugu'(udder).

546
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:42,339
-What is 'Podhugu? 
-Yeah, from which the milk...

547
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:43,381
You mean...

548
00:35:43,581 --> 00:35:44,304
Yes.

549
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:48,058
I, Nookaraju and two other men tried 
to touch it by tying it in the backyard.

550
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,948
But it was resisting and very relentless.

551
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,083
Four people tried 
together at the same time?

552
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:54,673
Did you see that, 
how publicly he is talking about it?

553
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:56,631
Gauri is another one that 
has come from Gujarat.

554
00:35:56,798 --> 00:35:58,673
She is very healthy and 
won't be like Lakshmi.

555
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,781
-Do you want me to send it? 
-Are you sure?

556
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:02,222
Alright, send her. She's lie there.

557
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:05,381
-What's with 'lying here'? 
-Let us go. We got a good deal.

558
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:08,155
Madam, 
did you see Venkataratnam's dealings?

559
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:09,781
What are talking about 'dealings'?

560
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:12,011
Hello! What? The steering isn't working?

561
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:13,835
-Don't you know, idiot? 
-See you.

562
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,673
Hey, did he go for jogging?

563
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:16,604
-He might have gone. 
-He woke up early...

564
00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:19,160
I thought it was just Karthik who is odd 
but all the villagers here are like him.

565
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:20,073
Karthik?

566
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:23,241
-Lady... 
-Whoa!

567
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:24,825
What did you study?

568
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:27,155
I have just completed my 
engineering this year. Why

569
00:36:27,255 --> 00:36:27,948
You nephew studied the same.

570
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:29,923
-Which college? 
-Vizag Woxsen College.

571
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:31,172
You nephew is also from the same college.

572
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,023
Why are you interested in our details?

573
00:36:33,272 --> 00:36:34,823
Oh! Just like that...

574
00:36:34,923 --> 00:36:36,464
He is targeting you, let's go!

575
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,222
You did a good thing by 
breaking up with Karthik.

576
00:36:39,422 --> 00:36:40,606
Otherwise, you would have 
got stuck in this village.

577
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:41,881
What is a 'breakup'?

578
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,506
Ending the relationship of love.

579
00:36:47,196 --> 00:36:53,151
[music]

580
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:11,589
Continue... Continue...

581
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,733
-[singing] 
-Hey, stop.

582
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:17,279
-I didn't ask you to continue your song... 
-Then?

583
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:19,048
I was asking about 
your girlfriend Harika.

584
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:22,389
How do you know about Harika, uncle?

585
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:25,389
You told me about it between 
the second and the third peg.

586
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:28,203
I think you are confused in 
intoxication. He did not say anything.

587
00:37:28,403 --> 00:37:29,172
Come again!

588
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:31,006
Oh! I got confused 
because of intoxication.

589
00:37:31,172 --> 00:37:32,264
He revealed everthing.

590
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:37,172
Oh my! This drink seems 
very dangerous, Uncle.

591
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,798
All my memories are flashing! 
But I don't remember telling you!

592
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:42,286
I shall go uncle.

593
00:37:42,486 --> 00:37:47,131
Hey... Everything is fine, but 
that teacup or breakup is not nice.

594
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:50,682
Ah! Oh no!

595
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:53,322
Did I say that too, uncle?

596
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:55,610
Oh no! You told me everything, nephew.

597
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,464
I thought that my nephew's love 
story would be as huge as Titanic.

598
00:37:59,506 --> 00:38:02,090
But your story doesn't even match 
even a 'small boat' in our village.

599
00:38:02,422 --> 00:38:05,746
Uncle, how can you deem my blockbuster 
love story to be like a small boat?

600
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:09,219
I wonder what I said in toxication 
and what you've heard in inebriation.

601
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:11,779
I will narrate it from 
the beginning. Listen.

602
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:13,589
Harika...

603
00:38:50,172 --> 00:38:55,547
"You're my Senorita, 
your smile is my sunlight"

604
00:38:55,714 --> 00:39:00,990
"You're my heartbeat, 
my life is going around you"

605
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:06,556
"I've got blocked in your 
thoughts like the time in wall-clock"

606
00:39:06,756 --> 00:39:12,072
"My heart is singing sweetly 
with the audio of yours"

607
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:17,464
"It's because of you I'm getting drenched 
in the colourful shower of romance"

608
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:20,006
"even in the drizzle 
without raindrops"

609
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:25,798
"You are I and I am you"

610
00:39:26,006 --> 00:39:28,864
"and there is 'L' between 
them which means I love you"

611
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:31,464
"You are I and I am you"

612
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:34,531
"My life says 'for you'... I am for you!"

613
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:36,714
"I... love... you"

614
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:43,255
"I... am... for you!"

615
00:40:46,506 --> 00:40:52,031
"Your dreams concealed in my 
eyes are like a garden of roses"

616
00:40:52,131 --> 00:40:57,297
"Your dreams concealed in my heart 
are like the desires that touch the sky"

617
00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:02,739
"The moment I met you for the first 
time was the most wonderful one"

618
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:08,339
"Time ceased to exist in 
the journey of our union"

619
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:14,255
"Our lips would become one 
to go for a sweet kiss"

620
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,297
"and show both of us as one"

621
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:19,214
"You are I and I am you"

622
00:41:19,422 --> 00:41:22,281
"and there is 'L' 
between them which means I love you"

623
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:24,881
"You are I and I am you"

624
00:41:25,188 --> 00:41:27,948
"My life says 'for you'... I am for you!"

625
00:41:28,048 --> 00:41:30,547
"You are I and I am you"

626
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:33,614
"and there is 'L' 
between them which means I love you"

627
00:41:33,714 --> 00:41:36,214
"You are I and I am you"

628
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:39,381
"My life says 'for you'... I am for you!"

629
00:41:40,172 --> 00:41:42,255
"I... love... you!"

630
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:48,798
"I... am... for you!"

631
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:58,481
Every moment that I've spent with her in 
those three years were marvellous, uncle.

632
00:42:01,331 --> 00:42:05,123
Now when I'm hearing it again, 
your love story seems magical!

633
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:07,835
So tell me about the breakup once again.

634
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:11,167
Uncle, look there is 
something on my head that hurts.

635
00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:11,980
Where?

636
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,742
Swear on me that you won't 
bring up that topic again.

637
00:42:14,842 --> 00:42:15,695
Hey, Karthik..

638
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:20,343
[phone rings]

639
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:22,205
Hello.

640
00:42:24,023 --> 00:42:24,539
Yes, sir.

641
00:42:27,272 --> 00:42:28,029
Okay, sir.

642
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,622
Our people have contacted the 
police station at Draksharamam.

643
00:42:31,673 --> 00:42:34,053
His statement tallies with 
the report that we got, sir.

644
00:42:34,372 --> 00:42:36,758
It is true that his nephew has 
been missing since three years, sir.

645
00:42:38,118 --> 00:42:41,557
So, all that he has told us 
till now must be true, right sir?

646
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:45,706
He has a nephew and he is missing.

647
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,856
Only that part was confirmed.

648
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:53,740
His nephew being in the army and he 
came for him, are yet to be proved.

649
00:42:53,964 --> 00:42:56,205
His future will be decided 
tomorrow at the cantonment.

650
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:06,059
Sir!

651
00:43:07,696 --> 00:43:10,135
Oh! You are way too yearning.

652
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:13,139
By the way, what will you do if you 
see your nephew, Venkatarathnam?

653
00:43:13,347 --> 00:43:15,593
I have so much anger on him that 
I want to hit him if I see him, sir.

654
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:17,864
Sir, isn't it wrong for him 
to leave without informing me?

655
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:19,111
Yes.

656
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:22,964
I can't hit him but I 
will just scold him, sir.

657
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:26,028
I can't do even that, sir.

658
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:30,432
I want to hug him tight if I see him.

659
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:31,749
This is correct.

660
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:37,379
Sorry!

661
00:43:37,793 --> 00:43:38,682
We have enquired in the entire army.

662
00:43:39,514 --> 00:43:41,074
There is no person in 
the army with this name.

663
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:45,368
Did he ask you to tell me that way, sir?

664
00:43:46,181 --> 00:43:46,969
Who?

665
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:49,051
Did my nephew ask you to tell me that way?

666
00:43:49,238 --> 00:43:50,308
What nonsense?

667
00:43:51,272 --> 00:43:52,832
Major, is he out of his mind?

668
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,161
Sir, I was doubtful about 
him since the beginning.

669
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:57,107
I just got him here for confirmation.

670
00:43:57,789 --> 00:43:59,256
I will take care of him, sir.

671
00:43:59,456 --> 00:44:00,097
Sorry, sir.

672
00:44:00,247 --> 00:44:03,485
Sir, my nephew is here. Sir, listen 
to me! Please, sir... Please...

673
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:06,972
-Sir, please... Sir, listen to me. 
-Take him away.

674
00:44:07,056 --> 00:44:09,836
Sir, my nephew is here. 
Sir, please... listen to me just once.

675
00:44:10,223 --> 00:44:12,278
Ramarao sir, tell them.. 
Please... Please...

676
00:44:12,378 --> 00:44:14,715
Make him talk to me once. 
Please, sir... Please, sir...

677
00:44:14,915 --> 00:44:16,355
Sir, at least make him talk to 
me over the phone. Please, sir.

678
00:44:16,555 --> 00:44:17,395
Please, sir... Sir...

679
00:44:17,993 --> 00:44:18,537
Hey!

680
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:21,583
Oh no! I am sorry...

681
00:44:22,014 --> 00:44:22,900
Sir... Ow!

682
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,539
Sir...

683
00:44:49,305 --> 00:44:50,201
Yes...

684
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,472
Karthiks's uncle has come for him.

685
00:44:53,514 --> 00:44:55,764
As per your instructions, I did not 
divulge anything and sent him away.

686
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,430
Maintain that.

687
00:44:58,555 --> 00:44:59,181
Yes, sir!

688
00:45:06,972 --> 00:45:09,972
Captain Karthik Shivaram Veeramachineni.

689
00:45:15,597 --> 00:45:18,896
Look Venkatarathnam, you are 
unable to understand your situation.

690
00:45:19,388 --> 00:45:20,559
Listen to me and tell me the truth.

691
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:23,605
I am telling you the truth, sir.

692
00:45:23,705 --> 00:45:27,889
If you are telling us the truth 
and if your nephew adores you,

693
00:45:29,014 --> 00:45:30,266
then why is he hesitant to meet you?

694
00:45:31,014 --> 00:45:32,472
Why is he hesitant to meet you?

695
00:45:33,014 --> 00:45:36,680
If you want to know that, 
then you should know our entire story.

696
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:37,889
Action..

697
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:41,201
Our MLA has given loans and encouraged us.

698
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:43,458
Today, I have sown this 'penta'(dump)

699
00:45:43,558 --> 00:45:45,941
-and all the credit goes to our MLA. 
-Hey... Cut... Cut...

700
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:49,997
-Why do you say 'penta'? 
-It is 'Panta'. Panta! (crop)

701
00:45:50,097 --> 00:45:53,680
Seems like our madam has not 
come out of yesterdays emotions!

702
00:45:53,747 --> 00:45:54,990
You are a great artist!

703
00:45:55,064 --> 00:45:56,223
Damn! Shut up!

704
00:45:56,323 --> 00:45:57,989
I'm the one who got selected for 
the auditions of 'Mahanati' movie!

705
00:45:58,177 --> 00:45:59,377
-And here you are insulting me? 
-What?

706
00:45:59,477 --> 00:46:01,055
-For the house maid's character? 
-Get lost, man!

707
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:04,223
I won't do this crap character! 
I am a heroine material.

708
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:08,931
Oh good! Your arrangements are good!

709
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:11,014
All these were done 
by Mr Venkataratnam.

710
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:12,238
There he comes!

711
00:46:18,844 --> 00:46:19,714
Whoa!

712
00:46:45,555 --> 00:46:46,642
What is your business with these people?

713
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:50,014
If we have to patch them up, we need 
to know the reason for their breakup.

714
00:46:50,305 --> 00:46:52,097
Karthik skipped this making me 
promise that I should never ask!

715
00:46:52,264 --> 00:46:54,385
At least I should know 
it through her... So...

716
00:46:54,685 --> 00:46:55,502
You are right.

717
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,969
-Greetings, sir. 
-So how did you like all the arrangements?

718
00:46:58,069 --> 00:46:59,537
Today's lunch is also from our home.

719
00:46:59,637 --> 00:47:03,097
-Why is he doing all these arrangements? 
-Why do you have a special interest on us?

720
00:47:03,197 --> 00:47:04,108
The thing is that...

721
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:07,097
if you don't mind, if you come with me 
into those bushes for just ten minutes...

722
00:47:07,197 --> 00:47:07,863
Aah!

723
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:09,028
He is calling you into the bushes.

724
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:11,497
We have a shed there with A.C.

725
00:47:11,597 --> 00:47:13,692
It gets cool down in 5 minutes 
and we can wrap it in 10 minutes

726
00:47:13,768 --> 00:47:15,129
-You won't even sweat. 
-Not at all.

727
00:47:15,555 --> 00:47:18,472
He seems to be a womanizer 
sporting traditional dress.

728
00:47:18,497 --> 00:47:20,131
Look... I won't come anywhere.

729
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:21,837
If you have anything to 
say, please say it here.

730
00:47:21,959 --> 00:47:24,377
No... No... This is not a matter 
which is to be discussed publicly.

731
00:47:24,477 --> 00:47:25,949
It needs a place and some privacy.

732
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:28,456
Just ten minutes, 
we will just go and comeback.

733
00:47:28,756 --> 00:47:31,356
This guy has nothing but full of lust.

734
00:47:31,411 --> 00:47:34,434
Look kiddo, do you need 
this? It is adult stuff.

735
00:47:34,444 --> 00:47:35,649
-I have a lot of work, let us go. 
-Yes.

736
00:47:35,677 --> 00:47:39,070
Look... Look, you might have a hundred 
works, but this is my only job.

737
00:47:42,722 --> 00:47:45,522
Hello, the shed is ours. 
We can finish the work in 5 minutes.

738
00:47:45,722 --> 00:47:48,305
-Hello... Hello... 
-Madam...

739
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:00,887
Action.

740
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:08,065
Hey... Hey... Stop... 
Stop... Just 5 minutes...

741
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:11,764
The matter is very sensitive. 
We can't discuss it publicly.

742
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,122
Why doesn't she understand?

743
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:16,127
I am your new Hindi teacher.

744
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:17,748
and your friend too.

745
00:48:18,097 --> 00:48:23,264
Since this is our first class together, 
we will know about each other.

746
00:48:23,388 --> 00:48:25,388
Then, we will know 
about you first, teacher.

747
00:48:28,056 --> 00:48:29,430
Sure. Ask.

748
00:48:31,597 --> 00:48:33,139
Do you have a boyfriend teacher?

749
00:48:33,339 --> 00:48:34,339
[children laugh]

750
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:36,139
Is this a question to ask a teacher?

751
00:48:36,264 --> 00:48:37,826
You have told us that 
you are like our friend.

752
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,465
So I have asked you in a 
friendly manner, teacher.

753
00:48:39,565 --> 00:48:41,430
I haven't liked anyone till date.

754
00:48:41,972 --> 00:48:43,767
That's why I don't have a boyfriend.

755
00:48:44,223 --> 00:48:44,972
Sit down.

756
00:48:48,806 --> 00:48:52,430
Teacher... 
You look very hot, aren't you?

757
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,555
I only wrote it as 'beautiful', 
dude. He just improvised it!

758
00:48:55,755 --> 00:48:56,936
Just asking in a friendly manner.

759
00:48:57,136 --> 00:48:58,136
Oh!

760
00:48:58,414 --> 00:49:00,478
Then, why aren't you married yet?

761
00:49:00,806 --> 00:49:03,600
My ambition is to

762
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,039
educate children living in 
small and remote villages.

763
00:49:07,472 --> 00:49:11,266
When I meet someone who 
respects my intention and profession

764
00:49:11,678 --> 00:49:13,610
then, I will marry him.

765
00:49:14,197 --> 00:49:15,285
Super.

766
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:18,056
-Okay. Any more questions? 
-I have a question, teacher.

767
00:49:19,014 --> 00:49:22,680
What is your opinion on a joint family?

768
00:49:23,014 --> 00:49:23,639
That is a good question.

769
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:27,639
If we can't live together, 
then how we even call it a family?

770
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:32,780
We can't call ourselves human 
if we can't share some space

771
00:49:33,132 --> 00:49:36,089
in the house for our blood relations.

772
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:37,597
Sit down.

773
00:49:38,764 --> 00:49:40,562
-Where is my chocolate? 
-Hey! Give him one.

774
00:49:40,722 --> 00:49:42,018
Why should we give him? 
Did he ask any question?

775
00:49:42,118 --> 00:49:42,929
-Look, I will ask one now... 
-Hey... Hey...

776
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:46,889
Who are these people crawling 
like crabs in the classroom?

777
00:49:47,014 --> 00:49:48,413
Hey, who is there?

778
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:50,216
Sorry, dude.

779
00:49:50,316 --> 00:49:50,954
Come out.

780
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,669
-Good morning, teacher. 
-Good night, teacher.

781
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:53,597
Hey what's good night?

782
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:55,056
-Goodbye, teacher. 
-Goodbye, teacher. Goodbye.

783
00:49:55,156 --> 00:49:56,303
Gulp the entire container too.

784
00:49:57,847 --> 00:50:03,056
There is one and only one person in 
this village to teach such guys a lesson.

785
00:50:04,014 --> 00:50:04,857
Mr Military Naidu.

786
00:50:05,181 --> 00:50:07,388
-What? 
-Some lady has come for you.

787
00:50:08,764 --> 00:50:09,750
A lady?

788
00:50:28,414 --> 00:50:29,705
My name is Vennela

789
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,834
Oh...

790
00:50:31,388 --> 00:50:32,972
I am the new Hindi teacher in the school.

791
00:50:33,388 --> 00:50:36,056
Hey, she is the teacher, bring her 
a tender coconut. Switch on the fan.

792
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:39,799
Oh!

793
00:50:40,055 --> 00:50:40,854
Oh no!

794
00:50:42,847 --> 00:50:44,597
Hey, why did you put the 
fan near those gunny bags?

795
00:50:46,305 --> 00:50:48,422
Mr Naidu, can you 'uff-uff' in my eyes?

796
00:50:48,622 --> 00:50:49,535
Uff-Uff?

797
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,247
She is asking you to puff in her eyes.

798
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:56,645
Go and uff-uff her.

799
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:00,840
-Uff... 
-Sir...

800
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:04,181
Go closer to her and puff 
in her eyes, Mr Naidu.

801
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,102
Yeah... Yeah...

802
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:13,071
[whistling sound]

803
00:51:13,806 --> 00:51:15,639
Why is cooker whistle 
sound coming from Mr Naidu?

804
00:51:15,983 --> 00:51:18,122
I heard the whistle, 
but not the blow of air!

805
00:51:19,472 --> 00:51:19,972
Eh?

806
00:51:20,722 --> 00:51:22,554
Take a deep breath...

807
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,074
Oh!

808
00:51:24,346 --> 00:51:25,112
and puff at once.

809
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:27,034
Oh!

810
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:29,850
[takes deep breath]

811
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,847
The dust is in my eyes, 
and not in my mouth.

812
00:51:41,514 --> 00:51:42,847
Mr Naidu, quick...

813
00:51:43,181 --> 00:51:44,722
-Mr Naidu 
-Uff...

814
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:47,305
By the way, 
you did not tell me why you have come?

815
00:51:47,388 --> 00:51:50,472
There is one boy who is irritating me.

816
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,580
Just make him wall-sit for two days. 
He will automatically fall in line.

817
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,432
I meant the boy to be a big guy.

818
00:51:57,288 --> 00:52:00,288
He is following me and giving 
so much 'Pareshaan'(annoyance)

819
00:52:00,488 --> 00:52:01,639
Mr Naidu does not 
understand Hindi, isn't he?

820
00:52:02,555 --> 00:52:03,341
Pareshaan...

821
00:52:03,499 --> 00:52:05,817
[laughs] 
Pareshaan...

822
00:52:08,388 --> 00:52:09,514
Pareshaan...

823
00:52:10,286 --> 00:52:11,363
He's caught. 
I shall do the cover-up.

824
00:52:11,663 --> 00:52:13,493
-Pareshaan... 
-Pareshaan... Pareshaan...

825
00:52:13,545 --> 00:52:14,840
Mr Naidu, 
can you look at this accounts?

826
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,931
She is saying 'Pareshaan? What is it?

827
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:19,133
She said 'Pareshaan' 
which means annoyance.

828
00:52:19,289 --> 00:52:21,028
She said some guy is 
following her and annoying.

829
00:52:21,284 --> 00:52:22,228
Oh!

830
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,722
Venkataratnam does not tolerate such 
things. Just tell me his name and address.

831
00:52:25,972 --> 00:52:29,597
I don't know the details. You 
have to somehow Dekhna(take care).

832
00:52:30,597 --> 00:52:32,185
-You want me to somehow Dekhna(take care). 
-Yes...

833
00:52:33,847 --> 00:52:34,931
Dekhna...

834
00:52:35,131 --> 00:52:35,900
Yes. Dekhna...

835
00:52:36,264 --> 00:52:38,181
-Dekhna... 
-Can you look at this accounts?

836
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:40,223
What the hell is she saying?

837
00:52:40,648 --> 00:52:42,422
It is not what you think.

838
00:52:42,622 --> 00:52:45,305
She asks you to handle this on your 
own as she doesn't know his address.

839
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,186
It is not a problem if she 
doesn't know his address.

840
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:48,578
Just pack him in a sack and get here.

841
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:52,597
-Apologise to the teacher. 
-Sorry, teacher.

842
00:52:52,697 --> 00:52:55,306
That boy is not someone 
like him with a pig face.

843
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:58,722
Thank God, this pig face saved me. 
It is not me, Mr Venkatarathnam.

844
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:00,931
If not him, who else could it be?

845
00:53:01,414 --> 00:53:02,262
Alright, do something.

846
00:53:02,462 --> 00:53:05,264
if he troubles you again, 
just call me and I will rip his skin off.

847
00:53:07,914 --> 00:53:09,210
Thanks a lot.

848
00:53:10,264 --> 00:53:10,806
Bye.

849
00:53:14,472 --> 00:53:15,972
What is this, dude? 
Our plan got reversed!

850
00:53:16,514 --> 00:53:19,181
If plan A does not work out, 
there are 25 more alphabets in English.

851
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:20,680
-Plan B 
-Yes.

852
00:53:21,305 --> 00:53:26,430
No matter how many plans they make, 
Karthik has to go to London this time.

853
00:53:26,806 --> 00:53:28,133
It is Happy Hanumanta Rao here.

854
00:53:28,444 --> 00:53:29,610
If we enter the court,

855
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,196
there would be no arguments, 
but only judgements.

856
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:33,644
If we talk legally,

857
00:53:33,784 --> 00:53:36,301
the custody of Karthik should be 
given to his paternal grandparents.

858
00:53:36,555 --> 00:53:40,388
However, they have been quiet since 
Venkataratnam requested them.

859
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,779
But this cannot go on...

860
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:43,680
Karthik must go.

861
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:47,223
Happy... Happy... Happy?

862
00:53:48,514 --> 00:53:50,093
She is not happy? 
[phone rings]

863
00:53:50,624 --> 00:53:51,670
One second.

864
00:53:54,014 --> 00:53:55,347
Happy Hanumanta Rao here.

865
00:53:55,414 --> 00:53:56,477
Sir, I have a small doubt.

866
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,371
If I kill someone in 
the middle of the road,

867
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:00,387
then, what is the section and punishment?

868
00:54:00,587 --> 00:54:02,981
Section 302 and 14 year of imprisonment.

869
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:06,514
What if I kill a lawyer, will the 
section and the punishment change?

870
00:54:06,722 --> 00:54:07,972
Lawyer?

871
00:54:10,097 --> 00:54:10,747
Why?

872
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:11,672
Then...

873
00:54:11,827 --> 00:54:15,400
you think we will keep quiet when 
you try to split a joint family?

874
00:54:16,188 --> 00:54:18,847
Lawyer, the death penalty will 
be sentenced if it is murder.

875
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:21,680
But if it an is acid attack, it will be 
7 years of imprisonment. What do you say?

876
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:23,388
No need... No... No...

877
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:26,544
Anyway, his face looks the same 
even if you pour acid or not.

878
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,555
Let's pour it on his second setup.

879
00:54:28,806 --> 00:54:29,555
What do you say?

880
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,806
No need. You won't get that chance.

881
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,299
What happened?

882
00:54:33,555 --> 00:54:35,907
Terrorist attack at the London airport.

883
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:37,305
All flights cancelled.

884
00:54:37,472 --> 00:54:38,639
What is this all of a sudden?

885
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:40,165
Is this Diwali or Dussehra

886
00:54:40,356 --> 00:54:41,477
to tell you exactly 
looking at the calendar?

887
00:54:41,564 --> 00:54:43,690
It is a terrorist attack. 
It can happen anytime, anywhere.

888
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:44,688
I'll take leave now.

889
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:45,888
Oh man!

890
00:54:47,514 --> 00:54:48,392
-I just escaped. 
-Oh no!

891
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,092
I just went to get sugarcane so 
that I can eat in the flight

892
00:54:50,168 --> 00:54:51,068
So, I am a bit late.

893
00:54:51,268 --> 00:54:52,354
-I'll come back right away. 
-It is time for your flight.

894
00:54:52,514 --> 00:54:53,010
Go pack your bags.

895
00:54:53,139 --> 00:54:54,722
No need. You've packed 
me up and that's enough!

896
00:54:54,847 --> 00:54:57,288
-Oh! Lawyer sir... Lawyer sir... 
-Please... Please... Leave me.

897
00:54:57,388 --> 00:54:59,511
I want to go to London 
Please take me with you, lawyer sir.

898
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:02,088
Please lawyer sir. 
Please don't leave me.

899
00:55:02,106 --> 00:55:04,002
Umm... Umm... Stop acting, 
grandpa is watching you.

900
00:55:12,388 --> 00:55:14,639
This attempt has failed too. 
What do we do now, master?

901
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:23,264
No matter what, Karthik must 
leave this house within that time.

902
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:28,972
They must be 
separated, as early as possible.

903
00:55:32,097 --> 00:55:33,056
Hi...

904
00:55:33,314 --> 00:55:35,492
Oh my God! 
Venkatrathnam is coming... Run...

905
00:55:35,677 --> 00:55:37,008
I am coming to you...

906
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,576
Wait. What you are doing is not right.

907
00:55:39,914 --> 00:55:41,639
If a respectable man has asked you 
for your time, you should consider, right?

908
00:55:41,831 --> 00:55:42,925
Did he ask for ten days?

909
00:55:43,001 --> 00:55:44,541
He just asked you for 
ten minutes. That's it!

910
00:55:44,764 --> 00:55:47,181
Why does he behave as if 
we've done the mistake?

911
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:49,141
Look, I will have to complain this 
to my father, if you go on like this.

912
00:55:49,341 --> 00:55:50,555
It won't seem good if you tell him.

913
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:52,692
Once the matter gets setted 
between us, I will go and tell him.

914
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:55,889
He is ready to convince your father too!

915
00:55:55,956 --> 00:55:57,582
-What is his confidence? 
-That's what!

916
00:55:57,697 --> 00:55:59,689
Any father would wish for 
his daughters' happiness.

917
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,555
No father would want his 
daughter to be happy like this!

918
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:04,906
-Hold this! 
-What is this?

919
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:06,264
Hold it, it's a letter.

920
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:07,879
I was awake all night to write this.

921
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:09,060
Usually, I deal everything 
inl face-to-face manner.

922
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,316
I am not used to writing such letters.

923
00:56:11,516 --> 00:56:12,194
If you read this,

924
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:14,314
you will understand my pain, yearning,

925
00:56:14,406 --> 00:56:15,959
eagerness and you'd 
approach me by yourself.

926
00:56:16,059 --> 00:56:18,889
I will be waiting for your answer. 
Okay? Okay, bye.

927
00:56:19,014 --> 00:56:20,764
I beg you, 
please accept this at least now.

928
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:34,287
What is it?

929
00:56:35,472 --> 00:56:36,081
It is Hilsa fish

930
00:56:36,181 --> 00:56:38,019
Found in the Godavari river and 
caught at Dhavaleswaram.

931
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:39,579
Digests, if you eat it, 
stays if you keep it.

932
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:40,570
You shut it!

933
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:42,179
We got it specially for you.

934
00:56:42,379 --> 00:56:45,597
If I engage them and call Military 
Naidu, they would be finished.

935
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:50,722
You worked so hard to get 
it for me. Have lunch here.

936
00:56:50,931 --> 00:56:52,347
In unison: Sure, we'd do that.

937
00:56:54,806 --> 00:56:56,459
-Check if the load has arrived. 
-Okay sir.

938
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:57,722
It is the teacher.

939
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,014
Ma'am, tell me

940
00:56:59,056 --> 00:57:00,514
Dhono (both) fools are at my house.

941
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,555
You please come soon.

942
00:57:02,843 --> 00:57:03,688
-Yeah... 
-Okay.

943
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,097
Dad, engage them in some 
talks and find out their details.

944
00:57:09,181 --> 00:57:11,464
The teacher called me saying 
some words like 'Phool'

945
00:57:11,751 --> 00:57:12,643
and asked me to come to her house.

946
00:57:12,743 --> 00:57:13,714
I didn't understand.

947
00:57:13,914 --> 00:57:16,972
Oh my! Phool means flowers in Hindi.

948
00:57:17,097 --> 00:57:20,631
She asked you to go to her home with 
flowers. That means she likes you.

949
00:57:20,731 --> 00:57:21,336
Hey, shut up.

950
00:57:21,536 --> 00:57:23,464
She is a teacher. She must have 
asked some flowers for Pooja

951
00:57:23,564 --> 00:57:24,247
Dirty mind!

952
00:57:24,347 --> 00:57:26,314
I wonder which Pooja she 
has called you for! Go do it.

953
00:57:26,514 --> 00:57:27,707
If uncle likes the food she cooked,

954
00:57:27,783 --> 00:57:29,243
she would pass the 
test of being my aunt!

955
00:57:29,443 --> 00:57:30,610
Do you think your uncle will come?

956
00:57:30,972 --> 00:57:33,847
If my guess is right, 
she must have called him already.

957
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:35,402
That nagging man is coming... 
That nagging man is coming...

958
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:40,954
[giggling hysterically]

959
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:44,472
-Enough of giggling... 
-What is your name?

960
00:57:44,555 --> 00:57:45,956
I haven't yet thought about it yet.

961
00:57:46,056 --> 00:57:47,023
What is that?

962
00:57:47,223 --> 00:57:50,772
My astrologer asked me to get a name that 
will start and end with certain syllables.

963
00:57:50,972 --> 00:57:53,330
And we have been waiting for a 
right combination since then.

964
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:54,709
-Oh God! 
-Don't cry.

965
00:57:54,806 --> 00:57:56,856
This old man will help you find a name.

966
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:57,931
Huh! Is it?

967
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,539
I will do that... And what's your name?

968
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:02,223
-I don't know. 
-What do you mean you don't know?

969
00:58:02,388 --> 00:58:03,705
My grandmother told me in 
my ear when I was a baby.

970
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:04,597
Then tell that.

971
00:58:04,697 --> 00:58:06,264
I was an infant, I didn't remember.

972
00:58:06,472 --> 00:58:07,539
Then, you should have 
asked her as you grew up.

973
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:08,885
She wasn't alive for him to ask.

974
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:10,581
-[sobs] 
-Hey, stop it!

975
00:58:11,014 --> 00:58:12,158
What do you call each other then?

976
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:14,268
-I call him 'Hey'. 
-And I call him 'Dude'.

977
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,806
-Dude... 
-Did you call me?

978
00:58:18,014 --> 00:58:19,639
-Hey... Hey... Hey 
-Did you call me?

979
00:58:20,223 --> 00:58:22,019
They seemed to have prepared well.

980
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:23,842
Let me not get into this names mess.

981
00:58:24,473 --> 00:58:27,830
By the way, I bought a new phone. 
Come, let us take a picture.

982
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,555
Oh! Yes, sure. 
Come, let's get clicked.

983
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:32,221
Ready

984
00:58:33,703 --> 00:58:36,007
1 2 3

985
00:58:36,288 --> 00:58:37,859
In unison: Did you get it? Did 
you get it? Show us... Show us.

986
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:38,549
Hey wait!

987
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:39,795
Why are you in a hurry to see the picture?

988
00:58:39,886 --> 00:58:41,607
You have to give me some 
time until I click it! Go back.

989
00:58:43,017 --> 00:58:43,592
Ready

990
00:58:45,024 --> 00:58:47,222
1 2 3

991
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:49,002
In unison: Did you get it? Did 
you get it? Show us... Show us.

992
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:49,764
Wait.

993
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:52,388
If you run back faster than a flash, 
how can I take your photo?

994
00:58:52,644 --> 00:58:53,115
Go back.

995
00:58:53,315 --> 00:58:54,130
Where are you?

996
00:58:54,387 --> 00:58:55,695
I am just beside your house. 
I'm coming in a moment.

997
00:58:56,764 --> 00:58:59,249
Don't enter from the main 
door, enter from the back door.

998
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:01,430
Back door? What is this?

999
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:03,764
Seems like whatever 
Nookaraju has told is happening.

1000
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:06,971
Master, the teacher is very 
intelligent, isn't she?

1001
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,078
Yes.

1002
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,387
Keep looking at the rest of the pictures.

1003
00:59:10,643 --> 00:59:13,187
You will soon get to know 
about her intelligence!

1004
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:16,056
Come, let's go!

1005
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:18,514
-Where to? 
-Bedroom.

1006
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,889
What? Bedroom?

1007
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,014
Quick.

1008
00:59:21,056 --> 00:59:22,230
I cannot do all this..

1009
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,023
The principal has told me that your 
are the right guy for such things!

1010
00:59:24,223 --> 00:59:24,847
Principal?

1011
00:59:24,889 --> 00:59:25,929
Why the hell did he say that?

1012
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,064
We are waiting for you.

1013
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:28,972
-Go take him inside. 
-Who is this?

1014
00:59:29,097 --> 00:59:30,181
He is my father.

1015
00:59:30,472 --> 00:59:31,722
Is it necessary for all 
these introductions now?

1016
00:59:31,856 --> 00:59:34,472
See that you live up to her expectations.

1017
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:35,956
-Take him inside. 
-Hey... Hey...

1018
00:59:35,959 --> 00:59:37,143
-Go... Go... 
-Oh no!

1019
00:59:41,097 --> 00:59:43,264
Oh my God! 
What are you doing?

1020
00:59:44,026 --> 00:59:45,130
Oh man!

1021
00:59:47,264 --> 00:59:49,722
Oh! These guys are hiding under the bed?

1022
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:52,889
Over there...

1023
00:59:55,388 --> 00:59:56,806
No...

1024
00:59:58,722 --> 01:00:00,171
No... It is wrong.

1025
01:00:02,972 --> 01:00:03,680
Please go...

1026
01:00:05,472 --> 01:00:07,490
Not up there.. Down...

1027
01:00:07,778 --> 01:00:08,738
-What do you mean? 
-Down...

1028
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,105
Where are these guys?

1029
01:00:11,305 --> 01:00:12,305
Did you call anyone else?

1030
01:00:12,405 --> 01:00:14,189
Father, those guys ran away... 
Come fast.

1031
01:00:14,289 --> 01:00:15,881
-What did she say? 
-Those guys ran away... Come fast.

1032
01:00:16,889 --> 01:00:19,064
Father, don't know where they have gone?

1033
01:00:19,264 --> 01:00:20,764
I forgot to close that door.

1034
01:00:20,872 --> 01:00:22,014
They ran away... Bloody hooligans!

1035
01:00:22,056 --> 01:00:23,712
Hooligans! Oh, is that it!

1036
01:00:24,056 --> 01:00:25,181
I got confused.

1037
01:00:25,514 --> 01:00:29,223
If they come again, please do call 
me. I will teach them a lesson.

1038
01:00:29,423 --> 01:00:30,423
[snifles]

1039
01:00:31,422 --> 01:00:34,981
Did you cook Hilsa fish 
curry? My mouth is watering.

1040
01:00:37,388 --> 01:00:40,264
Anyways it is lunchtime, 
why don't you have it here?

1041
01:00:41,264 --> 01:00:44,264
-It is okay. 
-You came here all the way for us.

1042
01:00:44,347 --> 01:00:46,806
If you have food with 
us, we will be happy.

1043
01:00:48,356 --> 01:00:50,892
Say okay to her. Say it...

1044
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,555
-Please have it. 
-Okay.

1045
01:00:57,806 --> 01:00:58,680
How does it taste?

1046
01:00:59,972 --> 01:01:02,388
It is very yummy! 
You cooked better than my mother.

1047
01:01:12,972 --> 01:01:15,014
Be careful with fish bones. Eat carefully.

1048
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:19,056
It is Daksharamam Venkatarathnam 
here... Fish bones... Ah!

1049
01:01:19,338 --> 01:01:22,541
[mumbles]

1050
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:23,274
Ah!

1051
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,548
[keeps groaning]

1052
01:01:27,664 --> 01:01:28,438
What happened?

1053
01:01:30,264 --> 01:01:31,139
Are you okay?

1054
01:01:33,397 --> 01:01:34,355
Slowly...

1055
01:01:37,889 --> 01:01:39,847
Fish bone... Fish bone... 
Fish bone...

1056
01:01:40,388 --> 01:01:43,223
-Fish bone? Uncle... 
-Wait, she will take care.

1057
01:01:43,388 --> 01:01:45,320
Fish bone? Give me a moment.

1058
01:01:46,764 --> 01:01:48,139
Swallow food without chewing

1059
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:50,305
Then the fish bone will 
slide in with the food.

1060
01:01:56,472 --> 01:01:57,139
Swallow it.

1061
01:01:58,472 --> 01:01:59,889
Slowly... Slowly...

1062
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:04,388
If this fish bone would have 
stuck some 20 years back, then...

1063
01:02:29,139 --> 01:02:34,972
"After a long time, after so many 
years of solitary confinement"

1064
01:02:35,097 --> 01:02:40,706
"An empty heart has dreams 
sprouting from the newly sown seeds"

1065
01:02:40,806 --> 01:02:46,764
"Like the Godavari river in a desert, 
the right foot is rippling the waters"

1066
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:52,455
"To which shore will these 
naughty ripples reach"

1067
01:02:52,555 --> 01:02:55,931
"The teacher has blown 
away Venky Mama's heart"

1068
01:02:58,597 --> 01:03:02,056
"Now, you take care of 
this naughty Venky Mama"

1069
01:03:40,347 --> 01:03:42,931
"Here you go, 
he is the brand new Venky Mama"

1070
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:44,972
"What a change, Mama!"

1071
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,639
"Mama... Mama..."

1072
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:51,429
"Mama... Mama... 
Ma... Ma... Mama..."

1073
01:03:51,629 --> 01:03:54,314
"Look at his moustache... 
Look at the lady in a saree..."

1074
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:57,291
"Both of them are shy 
but have become friends"

1075
01:03:57,555 --> 01:04:03,264
"The light breeze is steaming up 
their excitement and romance"

1076
01:04:03,722 --> 01:04:06,140
"The space between them is 
slowly ceasing to exist"

1077
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:09,308
"under the umbrella, while it's raining"

1078
01:04:09,722 --> 01:04:14,847
"During the hot summer, their happiness 
is like the cool moonlight"

1079
01:04:14,889 --> 01:04:20,831
"Like the Godavari river in a desert, 
the right foot is rippling the waters"

1080
01:04:20,931 --> 01:04:26,931
"To which shore will these 
naughty ripples reach"

1081
01:04:26,972 --> 01:04:30,347
"The teacher has blown 
away Venky Mama's heart"

1082
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:36,555
"Now you take care of 
this naughty Venky Mama"

1083
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:44,514
"After a long time, after so many 
years of solitary confinement"

1084
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:50,347
"An empty heart has dreams 
sprouting from the newly sown seeds"

1085
01:05:04,956 --> 01:05:06,231
We got the survey report, brother-in-law.

1086
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,000
Unless a miracle happens,

1087
01:05:09,713 --> 01:05:11,030
there is no way that we are 
going to win this election.

1088
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:16,884
If we give the people five 
thousand before the election,

1089
01:05:16,952 --> 01:05:19,177
they will give us five years.

1090
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:22,129
This is what called as 
democracy in English.

1091
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,818
Just pay a thousand rupee more 
per vote and our work will be done.

1092
01:05:25,864 --> 01:05:28,615
No, no, that won't workout now!

1093
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:30,599
The people have great aversion against us.

1094
01:05:32,109 --> 01:05:34,290
If you can, make Military Naidu...

1095
01:05:34,753 --> 01:05:35,524
Hey, what about Military Naidu?

1096
01:05:35,555 --> 01:05:36,062
Wait...

1097
01:05:38,564 --> 01:05:42,658
We will win if we can make him 
give one statement supporting us.

1098
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:47,521
If he has to become our strength then 
we should know his weakness first.

1099
01:05:49,643 --> 01:05:52,160
Focus on his weakness.

1100
01:05:53,171 --> 01:05:55,652
Excuse me, 
I need to meet Military Naidu.

1101
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:57,229
-He is inside. 
-Hmm.

1102
01:05:57,849 --> 01:05:59,847
Everyone in the village told me

1103
01:05:59,906 --> 01:06:02,044
Mr. Military Naidu is an apt person 
to teach Venkatarathnam a lesson.

1104
01:06:03,241 --> 01:06:06,244
Hello sir, my name is 
Candy and she is Harika.

1105
01:06:07,569 --> 01:06:12,708
[machine whirring] We came for your 
help. A strong man is troubling us.

1106
01:06:12,915 --> 01:06:16,102
You have to cut that 
Venkataratnam into pieces, sir.

1107
01:06:18,864 --> 01:06:19,611
[gasps]

1108
01:06:22,641 --> 01:06:26,317
My God! 
So you finally have some time for me.

1109
01:06:26,722 --> 01:06:27,757
Military Naidu?

1110
01:06:27,834 --> 01:06:28,356
It is me.

1111
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,898
-Then who is Venkataratnam? 
-Even that's me.

1112
01:06:30,962 --> 01:06:34,045
How can the people call this 
rapist as a highly respectable man?

1113
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,227
They should be...

1114
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:36,518
Hey, Nookaraju!

1115
01:06:36,718 --> 01:06:37,227
Yes, sir!

1116
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:38,549
Our girls have come.

1117
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:39,485
Yes, sir.

1118
01:06:39,585 --> 01:06:41,018
Ask everyone to have tea and come.

1119
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:43,606
Hey, everyone should leave. 
I should not see anyone here.

1120
01:06:43,614 --> 01:06:44,661
-In unison: Okay, sir. 
-We'll come to an understanding.

1121
01:06:44,861 --> 01:06:47,342
What is the issue between 
you and my nephew Karthik?

1122
01:06:47,646 --> 01:06:48,463
Karthik?

1123
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:49,244
Nephew?

1124
01:06:49,323 --> 01:06:52,316
I am not just his uncle but everything.

1125
01:06:52,616 --> 01:06:54,486
If he has done any mistake, 
please tell me and I will set it right.

1126
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:55,887
So, you were after me all these days...

1127
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:56,839
To know about this.

1128
01:06:56,989 --> 01:06:57,696
And the letter?

1129
01:06:57,871 --> 01:06:58,632
For that!

1130
01:06:58,734 --> 01:06:59,580
You asked to come aside?

1131
01:06:59,806 --> 01:07:00,617
To know that matter.

1132
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:01,971
Then what did you think?

1133
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:03,894
-Actually, we were thinking... 
-Stop it!

1134
01:07:04,094 --> 01:07:04,869
Is it necessary now?

1135
01:07:07,473 --> 01:07:10,258
So you want to know why I and 
Karthik split up, isn't it?

1136
01:07:12,782 --> 01:07:14,340
Why did you reject your job, Karthik?

1137
01:07:14,775 --> 01:07:17,022
Why are you more shocked 
than those interviewers?

1138
01:07:17,222 --> 01:07:19,373
Who else would be shocked to know this, 
Karthik?

1139
01:07:20,456 --> 01:07:22,668
I've applied to London University because 
I thought you'd clear the interview

1140
01:07:22,832 --> 01:07:24,244
and come to London.

1141
01:07:25,843 --> 01:07:28,156
I thought we will settle down there.

1142
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:31,107
I dreamt of a beautiful life with you.

1143
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:33,540
I am sorry Harika, 
if I gave you such expectations.

1144
01:07:35,164 --> 01:07:36,388
That is not my kind of life.

1145
01:07:38,659 --> 01:07:41,076
But these London and New York 
seem good only to look at.

1146
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:43,872
To live happily, my village is the best.

1147
01:07:45,466 --> 01:07:47,025
Because I have my uncle there.

1148
01:07:47,248 --> 01:07:50,205
What should I tell my 
father if he asks about you?

1149
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:55,665
Tell him that he rejected a job offer 
for his uncle who brought him up.

1150
01:07:56,775 --> 01:07:59,682
There is no better qualification 
for a daughter to get married.

1151
01:08:00,043 --> 01:08:02,859
Is it only this job or will 
you leave the girl you love?

1152
01:08:04,466 --> 01:08:05,385
This is my final question.

1153
01:08:06,325 --> 01:08:07,845
Do you want my love or your uncle?

1154
01:08:08,045 --> 01:08:11,528
I would choose my uncle even if you ask 
me to choose between my life and my uncle.

1155
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:30,267
My purpose of coming to 
this village is Karthik.

1156
01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:33,532
I thought I could rekindle the love.

1157
01:08:34,456 --> 01:08:37,284
But he only remembers the 
fight before we broke.

1158
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:41,270
I don't see him missing me.

1159
01:08:41,911 --> 01:08:43,271
I don't even find him 
happy that he met me again.

1160
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,490
-Harika, I will talk to my nephew. 
-Tsk!

1161
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:48,149
Please, I am flying abroad in two days.

1162
01:08:48,628 --> 01:08:50,779
You and your nephew can stay here happily.

1163
01:09:07,872 --> 01:09:09,335
Do you want my love or your uncle?

1164
01:09:09,706 --> 01:09:13,331
I would choose my uncle even if you ask 
me to choose between my life and my uncle.

1165
01:09:14,164 --> 01:09:15,589
The posting in London with handsome pay!

1166
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:18,166
Do you even realise what kind of future 
you are giving up for of your uncle?

1167
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:21,711
I don't need a future 
without my uncle, sir."

1168
01:09:30,956 --> 01:09:34,669
Karthik's paternal grandparents 
have come to take him to London.

1169
01:09:41,414 --> 01:09:44,462
This time around our Jataka Brahma has 
made a big plan. What shall we do now?

1170
01:09:45,065 --> 01:09:46,088
Go and pack your bags.

1171
01:09:46,331 --> 01:09:49,703
Super, uncle. I'll also participate 
if you tell me about the plan!

1172
01:09:49,803 --> 01:09:51,327
There is no plan. Move now.

1173
01:09:54,914 --> 01:09:55,676
Uncle?

1174
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,916
We brought you up well and we 
are done with our responsibility.

1175
01:09:58,116 --> 01:09:59,914
From now on, it's better for everyone 
to stay where they are supposed to be.

1176
01:10:00,956 --> 01:10:03,206
Hey, pack his luggage and 
put them in their vehicle.

1177
01:10:04,485 --> 01:10:05,645
I am not going anywhere, uncle.

1178
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:06,735
I will stay right here.

1179
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:09,484
Why are you forcing Karthik to 
leave when he is not interested?

1180
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:15,331
Mr Ganani, take your 
grandson along with you.

1181
01:10:16,997 --> 01:10:18,456
Did you happen to meet Harika?

1182
01:10:19,922 --> 01:10:20,880
Yes, I met her.

1183
01:10:21,839 --> 01:10:24,131
After speaking to her, 
I felt she was right.

1184
01:10:24,922 --> 01:10:28,799
It is wrong for all of us to stay 
right here for the sake of each other.

1185
01:10:28,889 --> 01:10:30,292
Her emotion is a selfish motive, uncle.

1186
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,774
Love itself is a selfish emotion.

1187
01:10:32,548 --> 01:10:35,173
I kept you with me for 23 years 
instead of sending you to them,

1188
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:36,037
that's a selfish motive too.

1189
01:10:36,339 --> 01:10:38,934
I was against the jobs Grandpa got 
for you as you'd move away from me

1190
01:10:39,187 --> 01:10:40,011
That's a selfish motive too.

1191
01:10:40,339 --> 01:10:41,430
How far is London?

1192
01:10:41,486 --> 01:10:43,794
If you board a flight, you will land here 
even before the date on calendar changes.

1193
01:10:45,673 --> 01:10:48,381
The date on the calendar 
may change in 24 hours

1194
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:51,085
but my heart won't change, 
no matter how much you try to change me.

1195
01:10:53,047 --> 01:10:55,089
Nobody can take me away from you, uncle.

1196
01:10:57,214 --> 01:10:58,644
Not even you.

1197
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:00,519
I am telling you finally.

1198
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,864
It is an oath on me that 
you go to London now.

1199
01:11:01,936 --> 01:11:02,496
Uncle!

1200
01:11:02,696 --> 01:11:03,379
Hey!

1201
01:11:07,515 --> 01:11:08,919
Don't do it Mr Venkatarathnam.

1202
01:11:11,232 --> 01:11:12,676
Don't force him.

1203
01:11:13,922 --> 01:11:17,138
When you, who used to resist us from 
taking our grandson called us to take him,

1204
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:18,669
We came here happily.

1205
01:11:25,756 --> 01:11:28,196
To know to what extent 
a person loves someone,

1206
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:31,076
we should see what he 
is giving up for them.

1207
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:35,526
He is ready to leave the girl he loved 
and property worth crores of rupees.

1208
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,295
It means the love you have 
showered on him is ultimate.

1209
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:44,631
Please let my grandson stay here happily.

1210
01:11:44,964 --> 01:11:46,102
I will convince him anyway...

1211
01:11:53,464 --> 01:11:57,172
Before I go, I wanted to return 
all of Karthik's memories.

1212
01:11:58,797 --> 01:12:01,786
Except for Karthik's 
career and my future with him,

1213
01:12:02,106 --> 01:12:05,178
I have never thought of his 
other emotions in his life.

1214
01:12:06,256 --> 01:12:10,548
Frankly, I could not imagine that 
those emotions are so beautiful.

1215
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:15,218
I came here to tell you that 
I will never see you again.

1216
01:12:16,172 --> 01:12:19,922
But after coming here, 
I don't want to leave you ever again.

1217
01:12:21,172 --> 01:12:22,272
I am sorry, Karthik.

1218
01:12:28,256 --> 01:12:29,256
I am really sorry.

1219
01:12:32,756 --> 01:12:36,256
Now... Now, it is really 
happy... happy... happy.

1220
01:12:40,964 --> 01:12:43,573
Did you call me to convince 
me about the marriage?

1221
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:47,464
I've called you to tell you not to 
approve for this marriage at any cost.

1222
01:12:49,006 --> 01:12:50,067
If you don't accept,

1223
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:54,483
my son will somehow get his 
nephew married to your daughter.

1224
01:12:55,131 --> 01:12:59,922
So, send her as far away as possible.

1225
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:10,214
Didn't you guys say that we need a 
miracle to win in these elections?

1226
01:13:11,131 --> 01:13:12,631
It has happened.

1227
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,131
Military Naidu is coming to meet me.

1228
01:13:17,172 --> 01:13:19,757
This is called 'miracle' in English.

1229
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:24,389
Under our MLA's leadership, 
many good schemes for youth, women,

1230
01:13:24,589 --> 01:13:29,223
backward classes and 
farmers have been devised.

1231
01:13:29,423 --> 01:13:32,597
We built bathrooms for every family. We 
provided water facilities for every house

1232
01:13:32,797 --> 01:13:33,931
We gave pensions to people above 45 years.

1233
01:13:34,131 --> 01:13:35,989
Sir... 
MLA Sir asked you to meet him.

1234
01:13:36,089 --> 01:13:38,889
We helped old people and donated 
wheelchairs for the disabled.

1235
01:13:39,073 --> 01:13:44,281
So if we elect our dear leader again 
with a huge majority, our...

1236
01:13:44,381 --> 01:13:47,381
I wanted to come to your home and 
discuss an important matter with you.

1237
01:13:48,172 --> 01:13:52,131
I know. Your nephew and my 
daughter love each other, isn't it?

1238
01:13:54,756 --> 01:13:55,656
Look there...

1239
01:13:55,756 --> 01:13:57,922
On this occasion, there is a good news.

1240
01:13:58,006 --> 01:14:00,044
It's been decided that our MLA Mr 
Pasupathy's only daughter Harika

1241
01:14:00,253 --> 01:14:03,118
will be married to Mr 
Venkatarathnam's nephew Karthik.

1242
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:04,506
Give them a huge round of applause. 
[applause]

1243
01:14:05,339 --> 01:14:06,172
Thanks!

1244
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:13,006
Now, Mr Venkataratnam shall speak 
of all the good deeds of our MLA

1245
01:14:17,423 --> 01:14:20,631
I have come here to talk about marriage. 
I request you not to politicize it.

1246
01:14:20,931 --> 01:14:22,976
Sir, he has just asked 
you for some moral support.

1247
01:14:23,014 --> 01:14:25,294
You are anyways going to be relatives. 
It won't be good if you don't talk.

1248
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:28,048
Do you think he won't 
do this for his nephew?

1249
01:14:30,922 --> 01:14:33,964
"Vote for Pasupathy Naidu", 
just say that one line.

1250
01:14:36,214 --> 01:14:39,098
Go Venkatarathnam, 
the public is waiting for you.

1251
01:14:39,298 --> 01:14:40,298
Go ahead!

1252
01:14:40,829 --> 01:14:42,006
Sir, please go.

1253
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,880
My greetings to everyone.

1254
01:14:51,089 --> 01:14:56,248
Our MLA, Mr Pasupathy Naidu has 
accomplished many developmental programmes

1255
01:14:56,721 --> 01:14:58,108
and took our region forward.

1256
01:14:59,464 --> 01:15:03,339
It is our responsibility to vote 
for him again for this tenure.

1257
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:04,539
[people cheering]

1258
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,339
It is fixed, sir! Not even God can stop 
you from winning this election.

1259
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:11,922
Will slap you with my shoe!

1260
01:15:12,122 --> 01:15:13,122
[silence]

1261
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:16,978
Just because you have 
hands, will you applaud to...

1262
01:15:17,007 --> 01:15:18,374
...anything that Tom Dick and Harry says.

1263
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:20,298
Can't you use your brains?

1264
01:15:20,506 --> 01:15:21,359
Or don't you want to 
use even if you have it?

1265
01:15:24,006 --> 01:15:24,954
I was opposing him tilll yesterday

1266
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:28,351
and today, I was praising 
him for the relationship,

1267
01:15:28,451 --> 01:15:29,531
can't you understand that?

1268
01:15:30,673 --> 01:15:34,423
Only if he has delivered 
his promises, vote for him.

1269
01:15:36,589 --> 01:15:40,423
But do not vote anyone because he 
is a relative of someone you know!

1270
01:15:41,631 --> 01:15:42,548
Do you get it?

1271
01:15:42,748 --> 01:15:43,748
[applause]

1272
01:15:47,298 --> 01:15:49,010
You have not done 
anything good as a leader,

1273
01:15:49,474 --> 01:15:52,066
at least be a good 
father to your daughter!

1274
01:15:54,168 --> 01:16:00,092
[people chatter]

1275
01:16:07,756 --> 01:16:09,473
Let us kill Military Naidu.

1276
01:16:09,673 --> 01:16:10,749
He has to live.

1277
01:16:12,631 --> 01:16:15,756
but his nephew who is 
like his soul should not!

1278
01:16:19,589 --> 01:16:20,381
Mom... tell me.

1279
01:16:20,522 --> 01:16:22,875
[music mutes voice]

1280
01:16:24,704 --> 01:16:30,652
[fair percussions]

1281
01:16:40,089 --> 01:16:42,922
Your uncle has promised to give 
Harika as your birthday gift.

1282
01:16:43,047 --> 01:16:44,223
Do you think his father 
Pasupathy will agree to this?

1283
01:16:44,423 --> 01:16:46,141
If he agrees, 
I will become her husband.

1284
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:48,069
Otherwise, I will become her 
father's husband! That's it!

1285
01:16:48,306 --> 01:16:49,224
Alrighty!

1286
01:16:51,339 --> 01:16:51,839
Hello...

1287
01:16:51,939 --> 01:16:52,918
Listen to me carefully.

1288
01:16:53,018 --> 01:16:54,282
Harika, why aren't you here yet?

1289
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:55,259
Can you hear me?

1290
01:16:55,459 --> 01:16:56,089
Hello...

1291
01:16:57,381 --> 01:16:57,880
Harika...

1292
01:16:58,131 --> 01:16:59,864
Please go away from 
that place immediately.

1293
01:16:59,901 --> 01:17:01,341
Where are you? Hello Harika

1294
01:17:01,773 --> 01:17:03,223
My father is planning to kill you.

1295
01:17:03,423 --> 01:17:05,298
I am here at the temple fair. 
Where are you?

1296
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,352
Harika, where are you?

1297
01:17:23,552 --> 01:17:24,868
Karthik... Hello...

1298
01:17:25,548 --> 01:17:26,423
Can you hear me?

1299
01:17:29,089 --> 01:17:29,797
Harika...

1300
01:17:34,256 --> 01:17:34,964
Harika...

1301
01:17:35,922 --> 01:17:36,573
Can you hear me?

1302
01:17:36,673 --> 01:17:37,464
Harika!

1303
01:17:39,797 --> 01:17:40,715
Karthik!

01:17:53,396 --> 01:17:54,099
Hey...

01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:55,772
[tyres screech]

1308
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:06,839
Karthik!

[whistles]

1312
01:19:10,589 --> 01:19:13,006
So the death of Uncle and 
his nephew is written here!

1313
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:14,206
Hey!

1314
01:19:14,589 --> 01:19:16,877
I believe in my strength, not fate.

1315
01:19:17,922 --> 01:19:21,193
Hold your knives, 
tighten your waist thread,

1316
01:19:21,401 --> 01:19:23,145
write down your address and 
keep them in your pockets!

1317
01:19:23,464 --> 01:19:26,506
It is my responsibility to send 
your dead bodies to your homes.

1318
01:19:36,582 --> 01:19:37,425
[groans]

1319
01:19:45,339 --> 01:19:46,989
I taught him how to 
swim in Godavari river,

1320
01:19:47,089 --> 01:19:48,314
taught him to play in the ring

1321
01:19:48,491 --> 01:19:50,150
and now I will teach him 
how to hunt, in this fair

1322
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:50,944
Come along, my nephew.

1323
01:20:28,172 --> 01:20:28,922
Karthik...

1324
01:20:32,789 --> 01:20:33,893
Hey!

1325
01:20:41,089 --> 01:20:42,330
You'll done and dusted.

1326
01:20:49,179 --> 01:20:50,346
[groans]

1327
01:20:56,298 --> 01:21:00,152
The fair is going to get 
coloured with your blood this time.

1328
01:21:00,352 --> 01:21:01,548
Come on, you idiots!

1329
01:21:08,922 --> 01:21:11,722
You asked him to send his daughter 
away. But he has sent thugs to kill him.

1330
01:21:11,922 --> 01:21:13,256
I didn't understand that...

1331
01:21:13,756 --> 01:21:16,131
What sin has he committed 
that you deceived him?

1332
01:21:16,548 --> 01:21:17,922
That's not a sin, Lakshmi.

1333
01:21:19,589 --> 01:21:20,460
It's his curse!

1334
01:21:23,964 --> 01:21:26,922
The moment I knew about his 
birth, I saw his horoscope.

1335
01:21:28,089 --> 01:21:30,267
The baby who was born was 
not my grandson but my son's...

1336
01:21:32,231 --> 01:21:34,383
...but my son's death, 
is what I came to know.

1337
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,506
Karthik's horoscope is like 
that of Lord Krishna, Lakshmi.

1338
01:21:45,506 --> 01:21:49,298
It shows... Karthik is born 
to kill his maternal uncle.

1339
01:21:55,381 --> 01:21:58,089
Today is his 24th birthday,

1340
01:21:58,423 --> 01:22:01,131
any moment can be a 
peril to Venkatarathnam.

1341
01:22:15,839 --> 01:22:17,600
Any minute is dangerous.

1342
01:22:32,922 --> 01:22:33,922
Oh God!

1343
01:22:35,089 --> 01:22:39,047
Why did you curse me with the 
ability to look into the future?

1344
01:22:42,839 --> 01:22:47,548
Hey, the gang that you've brought are 
only left with breath in their bodies.

1345
01:22:47,631 --> 01:22:49,839
If you repeat this again, 
they will be dead.

1346
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,464
Go, tell you brother-in-law...

1347
01:22:52,673 --> 01:22:54,589
his daughter is going to 
live in my house from now.

1348
01:22:54,882 --> 01:22:55,789
Let's go nephew.

1349
01:23:17,132 --> 01:23:18,382
Sign on this discharge sheet.

1350
01:23:19,507 --> 01:23:21,132
I do not know how you 
feel Venkatarathnam...

1351
01:23:21,465 --> 01:23:24,465
But I am very tensed about 
what my Sir might do to you.

1352
01:23:24,924 --> 01:23:26,091
I am also tensed, Sir.

1353
01:23:26,632 --> 01:23:29,256
I don't know whom to ask about my nephew.

1354
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:33,178
Wait here man...

1355
01:23:36,507 --> 01:23:37,447
Who's that man, sir?

1356
01:23:37,799 --> 01:23:39,007
Brigadier Vijay Prakash.

1357
01:23:39,298 --> 01:23:41,590
He came to see the body of an 
officer killed in the church attack.

1358
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,590
Does that mean he is the boss of all?

1359
01:23:45,256 --> 01:23:46,840
He is the head of the entire cantonment.

1360
01:23:50,423 --> 01:23:51,882
Sir, the discharge sheet.

1361
01:23:52,382 --> 01:23:53,799
If I missed this, he would have killed me.

1362
01:23:54,298 --> 01:23:55,465
Huh! Where is this guy?

1363
01:23:56,215 --> 01:23:58,414
Brigadier sir! 
Sir, Sir, please listen to me once

1364
01:23:58,614 --> 01:24:00,757
Vijay Prakash Garu sir! Listen to me once.

1365
01:24:03,715 --> 01:24:05,049
He is Karthik's uncle, Sir.

1366
01:24:06,403 --> 01:24:07,417
My name is Venkatarathnam.

1367
01:24:07,617 --> 01:24:08,717
My nephew is here in the military, Sir.

1368
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:11,674
I've already told you that 
your nephew is not here.

1369
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:13,256
-Major, throw him out. 
-Sir!

1370
01:24:13,844 --> 01:24:14,965
-I am sure that he is here. 
-Hey... come!

1371
01:24:15,173 --> 01:24:17,415
Sir, I will manage. You go ahead

1372
01:24:17,664 --> 01:24:19,882
They are all lying, Sir. 
You should do justice to me, Sir.

1373
01:24:20,256 --> 01:24:21,394
How many times should I tell you?

1374
01:24:21,594 --> 01:24:23,925
Karthik Shivaram Veeramachineni 
is not in the army!

1375
01:24:25,067 --> 01:24:26,423
Come again, Sir.

1376
01:24:26,757 --> 01:24:30,757
Nobody with the name Karthik Shivaram 
Veeramachineni is in the army!

1377
01:24:30,873 --> 01:24:32,715
Sir, I just mentioned the 
name Karthik Shivaram.

1378
01:24:32,882 --> 01:24:36,399
If they don't know him, how can he 
mention the surname Veeramachineni, Sir?

1379
01:24:42,014 --> 01:24:42,862
Ajay...

1380
01:24:43,844 --> 01:24:44,462
Sir

1381
01:24:44,696 --> 01:24:45,700
Take him to Karthik.

1382
01:24:52,382 --> 01:24:53,890
-Sir? 
-Do what I say?

1383
01:24:54,228 --> 01:24:54,990
Yes, Sir.

1384
01:24:56,423 --> 01:24:58,132
Thank you Sir! Thank you.

1385
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:03,132
Please do not tell my 
nephew that we are coming.

1386
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:04,465
Otherwise he might escape again

1387
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:05,842
I won't tell him

1388
01:25:06,674 --> 01:25:09,590
Why did your nephew join the army? 
Scared of the horoscope?

1389
01:25:14,757 --> 01:25:16,298
Grandma, is whatever you are saying true?

1390
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:17,598
Yes, son.

1391
01:25:18,215 --> 01:25:23,049
It is the truth your grandpa has been 
hiding in his heart for the past 25 years.

1392
01:25:37,965 --> 01:25:39,632
How well does Dad say all these!

1393
01:25:40,548 --> 01:25:44,298
How can you take such 
dangerous matter so easily?

1394
01:25:44,946 --> 01:25:45,976
What else can I say mother?

1395
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,506
Anyone might be crushed 
under a bus or a train

1396
01:25:48,816 --> 01:25:50,985
but he is being crushed 
under the weight of horoscope.

1397
01:25:51,548 --> 01:25:54,256
This time I will predict what will happen

1398
01:25:54,799 --> 01:25:56,548
Both of them will get 
married on the coming 15th.

1399
01:25:57,215 --> 01:26:00,091
Even if her father's goons 
or my father's horoscope comes in way,

1400
01:26:00,256 --> 01:26:01,754
I will get them married 
under all circumstances.

1401
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:02,813
Come on nephew!

1402
01:26:03,067 --> 01:26:05,132
Wonder when he will he 
out of these stupid beliefs

1403
01:26:07,298 --> 01:26:10,173
They don't believe me however hard I try

1404
01:26:12,298 --> 01:26:13,715
They will not believe it, Lakshmi

1405
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:16,548
If they believe it, they will be cautious.

1406
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:20,924
So, fate will not let them believe it.

1407
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,465
I am scared, Lakshmi.

1408
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:30,548
I have to set my uncles' 
love matter right in two days

1409
01:26:30,601 --> 01:26:32,306
Both our marriages should 
happen at the same time!

1410
01:26:32,506 --> 01:26:33,897
GROUP: Don't beat us sir!

1411
01:26:39,757 --> 01:26:42,548
Hey... what is happening inside?

1412
01:26:42,632 --> 01:26:45,382
Hindi teacher has complained 
that someone is teaser her.

1413
01:26:45,465 --> 01:26:48,465
So your uncle is ripping 
the neighboring goons apart.

1414
01:26:49,215 --> 01:26:51,590
Dude, if your uncle is ripping them apart.

1415
01:26:51,926 --> 01:26:52,902
What's our destiny going to be?

1416
01:26:53,102 --> 01:26:53,929
Hey!

1417
01:26:54,129 --> 01:26:55,041
[groans]

1418
01:26:55,241 --> 01:26:56,020
Oh no!

1419
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,799
I can't even imagine that...

1420
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,457
Hey, I will decide it today, call Harika.

1421
01:27:00,657 --> 01:27:01,197
Harika?

1422
01:27:01,397 --> 01:27:02,522
I am asking you again...

1423
01:27:02,862 --> 01:27:05,567
if you do not tell me 
who is troubling the teacher

1424
01:27:05,891 --> 01:27:07,218
I will rip your skin off...

1425
01:27:07,403 --> 01:27:09,738
-Like how they dehusk rice! 
-Uncle, uncle, stop it. Stop it

1426
01:27:09,838 --> 01:27:11,215
You don't know they're 
troubling the school teacher.

1427
01:27:11,382 --> 01:27:12,797
-I know everything uncle. 
-You do?

1428
01:27:13,132 --> 01:27:16,632
He is not among them. 
You can go, you can go.

1429
01:27:17,007 --> 01:27:18,840
But how do you know that he 
is not among these people?

1430
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:20,585
Well, Uncle...

1431
01:27:20,799 --> 01:27:21,376
What?

1432
01:27:21,576 --> 01:27:22,548
The truth is...

1433
01:27:22,965 --> 01:27:24,488
No such character exists, Uncle.

1434
01:27:24,688 --> 01:27:25,114
Huh?

1435
01:27:25,314 --> 01:27:26,757
It is a story made up by the teacher.

1436
01:27:26,924 --> 01:27:28,055
Why will the teacher lie?

1437
01:27:28,323 --> 01:27:29,225
To get closer to you

1438
01:27:29,425 --> 01:27:32,632
Hey, hey, it is not right to 
talk about the teacher like that.

1439
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,465
Oh Uncle! Just think about it once...

1440
01:27:34,674 --> 01:27:36,364
That day when dust fell 
in teacher's eyes...

1441
01:27:36,564 --> 01:27:39,995
Why didn't she ask Nookaraju who was 
just beside her to blow in her eye?

1442
01:27:40,195 --> 01:27:41,236
Why did she ask you only?

1443
01:27:41,542 --> 01:27:42,208
Why did she?

1444
01:27:42,408 --> 01:27:43,489
Well, to get closer to you!

1445
01:27:43,689 --> 01:27:45,332
Hey stop your silly logic!

1446
01:27:45,728 --> 01:27:46,489
Ok! Leave that.

1447
01:27:46,689 --> 01:27:47,998
She called you home on the 
pretext of that harasser.

1448
01:27:48,198 --> 01:27:49,843
She cooked your favourite fish curry.

1449
01:27:50,043 --> 01:27:52,715
Took care when you swallowed a thorn. 
But did he come?

1450
01:27:52,799 --> 01:27:54,185
Why did she do that?

1451
01:27:54,465 --> 01:27:56,132
To get closer to me.

1452
01:27:56,543 --> 01:27:57,234
Ah!

1453
01:27:57,434 --> 01:27:59,674
Whatever, I won't believe this.

1454
01:27:59,924 --> 01:28:01,810
Ok! Call the teacher now.

1455
01:28:02,204 --> 01:28:03,791
Tell her that you found the guy.

1456
01:28:04,086 --> 01:28:06,590
If she doesn't open up now, 
I promise on this fellow!

1457
01:28:07,632 --> 01:28:10,340
All the naughty guys are gone now. 
Whom should I show her?

1458
01:28:10,382 --> 01:28:13,924
I have an idea. 
When the teacher comes, point at me.

1459
01:28:15,715 --> 01:28:19,490
Because there's really no such person, 
she'll agree to anyone that you point at!

1460
01:28:19,657 --> 01:28:20,965
[to himself] Hmm? Okay

1461
01:28:22,632 --> 01:28:23,882
Where are those isiots?

1462
01:28:24,423 --> 01:28:25,293
Turn around, you!

1463
01:28:28,132 --> 01:28:31,007
-These are the guys! He is that idiot! 
-Whoa!

1464
01:28:32,049 --> 01:28:34,840
Teacher, 
look at him one more time and tell me.

1465
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:37,840
He is the guy!

1466
01:28:38,173 --> 01:28:40,215
And I am not his henchman?

1467
01:28:40,632 --> 01:28:41,924
Yes, both of them!

1468
01:28:42,007 --> 01:28:42,680
These guys?

1469
01:28:46,049 --> 01:28:47,049
Beat them well.

1470
01:28:47,632 --> 01:28:49,711
-Oh! No! Not in front of a lady! 
-No sir!

1471
01:28:49,911 --> 01:28:50,973
To that side!

1472
01:28:51,215 --> 01:28:53,548
Yes, that side...

1473
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:56,340
-You stay here, while I rip them off. 
-Lets go, let's go...

1474
01:28:56,924 --> 01:29:00,215
-Please do not beat us sir! 
-Why the teacher lying?

1475
01:29:00,357 --> 01:29:02,890
Ah! How many times do we tell you? 
It is to get closer to you!

1476
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:05,215
Please do not beat us, sir!  
[girl crying]

1477
01:29:05,395 --> 01:29:07,876
Leave me Venkatarathnam sir! 
[girl crying]

1478
01:29:09,924 --> 01:29:10,740
Who are you?

1479
01:29:11,215 --> 01:29:11,992
Why are you crying?

1480
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,465
Because Karthik is my lover.

1481
01:29:13,665 --> 01:29:14,858
Please don't hit me, Uncle!

1482
01:29:15,111 --> 01:29:16,008
Why is he calling him uncle?

1483
01:29:16,298 --> 01:29:20,091
Because Karthik has planned 
this to unite you together.

1484
01:29:20,215 --> 01:29:20,694
What?

1485
01:29:20,894 --> 01:29:23,507
What are you saying? 
So wont the teacher call me anymore?

1486
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:25,674
-She won't come here anymore? 
-What other reason does she have?

1487
01:29:25,761 --> 01:29:28,924
-As the characters she created are busted. 
-The connection is cut!

1488
01:29:29,049 --> 01:29:30,132
The connection is cut?

1489
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:33,548
That is how Karthik planned this.

1490
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:37,757
His uncle started 
loving you but you didn't.

1491
01:29:38,924 --> 01:29:42,314
Does that mean he loves me?

1492
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:47,215
Hey, seems like you are 
in love with him too!

1493
01:29:49,007 --> 01:29:51,007
If you miss the chance now, 
the teacher can never be your wife.

1494
01:29:51,298 --> 01:29:53,348
Please save your love and my lover too.

1495
01:29:53,632 --> 01:29:55,137
Go and propose her uncle, just go

1496
01:29:55,507 --> 01:29:58,116
I request you to give her 
an aunt, uncle. I beg you!

1497
01:29:58,548 --> 01:30:01,340
Go uncle, go!

1498
01:30:02,924 --> 01:30:03,929
-Why am I stuck like this? 
-Uncle!

1499
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:07,739
You are going like a student. 
Where is the style, uncle?

1500
01:30:07,939 --> 01:30:09,234
Where is the Victory style?

1501
01:30:34,973 --> 01:30:36,698
Whoa!

1502
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:38,070
Huh?

1503
01:30:39,632 --> 01:30:40,924
Why did you stop?

1504
01:30:41,247 --> 01:30:43,119
-Say it! 
-Give me a minute. I'm practising...

1505
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:44,694
-Just say 'I love you'... 
-Yeah, that's what!

1506
01:30:44,965 --> 01:30:46,757
'I love you', not good.

1507
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:49,304
'I love you'... Ah!

1508
01:30:50,327 --> 01:30:51,179
'I love you'

1509
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:52,689
You tell him.

1510
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:56,382
I love you a lot as well.

1511
01:30:56,548 --> 01:30:57,590
Wait, I'm practising.

1512
01:30:57,882 --> 01:30:59,924
Uncle! Do you understand 
what the teacher is saying?

1513
01:31:00,132 --> 01:31:02,013

-Hey, I do not understand Hindi.

01:31:02,213 --> 01:31:03,224
-I will tell her in my style. 
-Ah!

1515
01:31:03,424 --> 01:31:04,416
Just wait for two minutes, please.

'I love you'

01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:13,465
-That is what I am trying to practise. 
-Just wait for two minutes.

1518
01:31:13,799 --> 01:31:16,256
I just told you, "I love you".

1519
01:31:17,007 --> 01:31:19,465
Why are you saying 'I love you' 
while I am trying to practise.

Oh my! Do you know what 
the teacher is saying?

1521
01:31:22,049 --> 01:31:24,180
What else? She has been 
saying I love you...

1522
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:26,363
I love you, she said I love you nephew!

We cannot stop death

But if we know the source of danger

1559
01:35:35,728 --> 01:35:41,096
we can only postpone 
death by being cautious

I don't think it is shopping

was about to hit uncle.

is a puncture, it will lose control.

There are about 200 people just 
to serve in the marriage function, aunt.

what is going to happen.

Play your card first...

1629
01:41:29,272 --> 01:41:31,464
Why did you come? Where is your aunt?

1630
01:41:31,778 --> 01:41:32,620
Where is the video?

1631
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:34,876
If your aunt does not show 
up in the next ten minutes,

1632
01:41:35,135 --> 01:41:36,485
the video will be up on the internet.

-Tell me!

Feel sorry for the three hundred children, 
Sir!

1640

You don't have to feel so.

1641
01:42:32,272 --> 01:42:35,439
You need this intensity to 
separate the nephew from his uncle.

1642

I am sure to build a beer factory.

children are stuck inside the room.

1654
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,072
None of us are able to enter.

01:45:03,772 --> 01:45:04,689
Tell me, you...

01:45:08,772 --> 01:45:10,064

1660
01:45:22,014 --> 01:45:27,064

as I was returning from the second show.

1661
01:45:27,814 --> 01:45:30,855
I was scared and hid myself here. 
Look how he burnt this down.

1662
01:45:32,230 --> 01:45:34,314
-I will kill you, if you lie idiot... 
-Hey, wait

1663
01:45:34,605 --> 01:45:36,314
Then why don't you tell us the truth.

1664
01:45:37,106 --> 01:45:39,732
Why are you here at this wee hour 
and why did you beat my people?

1665
01:45:40,106 --> 01:45:42,099
He wouldn't beat anyone 
without any reason.

1666
01:45:43,022 --> 01:45:45,563
-Tell me why did you beat him? 
-Uncle, this idiot's phone has...

01:45:55,719 --> 01:45:56,960
Go on!

1668
01:45:57,956 --> 01:46:01,722
Let everyone know about the bare truth!

1669
01:46:04,605 --> 01:46:07,730
Neither is your nephew answering 
nor are you believing my fellow.

1670
01:46:08,439 --> 01:46:09,564
Ok, leave all this aside.

1671
01:46:09,772 --> 01:46:13,106
Master, you are like a man of justice, 
tell us what happened?

1672
01:46:14,439 --> 01:46:17,855
Who hit whom and who is the reason 
for the hostel to be burnt down?

1673
01:46:18,615 --> 01:46:19,372
Well...

1674
01:46:19,572 --> 01:46:21,231
Do not fear anyone, just say it.

1675
01:46:22,798 --> 01:46:26,563
Karthik came chasing and 
threw a cylinder on Dora babu.

1676
01:46:29,231 --> 01:46:32,480
Oh! So the cylinder burst and 
burnt the entire hostel down

1677
01:46:33,010 --> 01:46:37,189
He thinks he can do anything 
because of his uncle's support!

1678
01:46:38,072 --> 01:46:40,347
Uncle, just give me ten minutes. 
I will make things clear.

1679
01:46:40,447 --> 01:46:41,314
Wait.

1680
01:46:41,605 --> 01:46:46,647
Look, his rage is what brought 
this hostel down to ashes!

1681
01:46:47,439 --> 01:46:48,772
This is how you brought up your nephew!

1682
01:46:49,183 --> 01:46:51,231
Don't you dare say another 
word against my uncle!

1683
01:46:51,356 --> 01:46:53,062
-Karthik, leave it! 
-Uncle you have no idea...

1684
01:46:53,563 --> 01:46:54,948
-Karthik leave him... 
-Aren't you behind this?

1685
01:46:55,730 --> 01:46:57,189
You do not know what these idiots did...

1686
01:47:04,106 --> 01:47:06,730
Its three hundred children... 
What if something happened to them?

1687
01:47:08,563 --> 01:47:10,480
How will you know the 
pain of father and mother?

1688
01:47:18,231 --> 01:47:22,563
What will be his reaction when he gets 
to know that there is no such video?

1689
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:25,356
This is what is called 'shock' in English!

1690
01:47:51,855 --> 01:47:53,480
Though I hit him in anger...

1691
01:47:54,231 --> 01:47:56,398
I knew there was a reason 
behind his silence, Sir.

1692
01:48:01,647 --> 01:48:04,480
All this was done by this filthy 
idiot sir. Release Karthik.

1693
01:48:10,526 --> 01:48:11,774
Your nephew is here. Take him.

1694
01:48:13,106 --> 01:48:13,939
Hey Karthik...

1695
01:48:17,314 --> 01:48:18,022
Karthik...

1696
01:48:22,814 --> 01:48:23,814
It was my mistake.

1697
01:48:24,314 --> 01:48:25,814
He told me the truth 
after he was beaten up.

1698
01:48:26,106 --> 01:48:28,981
He tried to put you in a fix 
with some old vengeance.

1699
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:30,724
Ok, let's go home.

1700
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:59,015
At that moment, 
he not only pushed my arm away...

1701
01:48:59,641 --> 01:49:01,322
but erased me from his life.

1702
01:49:02,189 --> 01:49:04,106
That was the last time I saw him.

1703
01:49:04,730 --> 01:49:09,814
Except for my life, he took all my joy 
and happiness along with him.

1704
01:49:10,772 --> 01:49:14,153
You are his uncle who took care of him, 
just because you raised your hand on him,

1705
01:49:14,511 --> 01:49:16,784
would he join the army 
just because of that?

1706
01:49:17,563 --> 01:49:20,064
Except my heart, 
everyone in the village thought so.

1707
01:49:20,981 --> 01:49:22,981
It took me three years 
to know the exact reason.

1708
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:27,939
If he intends to marry her, finalise 
an auspicious time of wedding right now.

1709
01:49:28,356 --> 01:49:31,159
Otherwise ask your son to convince 
her to get married to someone else.

1710
01:49:31,563 --> 01:49:33,784
Dad please, 
if I knew this was your intention,

1711
01:49:34,196 --> 01:49:35,661
I would not come here with you.

1712
01:49:36,647 --> 01:49:39,480
I can wait as long as he wants me to.

1713
01:49:40,981 --> 01:49:44,356
You wait lady, 
I know his pain as a father!

1714
01:49:45,064 --> 01:49:48,855
My daughter now works in Bangalore 
due to aversion for love and marriage.

1715
01:49:49,189 --> 01:49:51,231
You have to convince her to 
get married to someone else.

1716
01:49:51,356 --> 01:49:52,522
That's not needed. My nephew will come.

1717
01:49:53,106 --> 01:49:54,158
Both the marriages will happen at once.

1718
01:49:54,439 --> 01:49:57,855
Oh! Yeah, yeah, he will come... 
Why will he come and when will he come?

1719
01:49:58,022 --> 01:50:00,855
Why will he come when you have 
hit him and now trying to heal?

1720
01:50:00,939 --> 01:50:03,189
His way of life is very strange...

1721
01:50:04,855 --> 01:50:09,022
He chased away his nephew while 
my daughter is to get married to him.

1722
01:50:10,398 --> 01:50:13,314
-Ask him what answer can he give us? 
-You please wait...

1723
01:50:14,022 --> 01:50:15,031
I will talk to him...

1724
01:50:17,398 --> 01:50:20,022
We don't know his whereabouts 
and when he will come back.

1725
01:50:20,356 --> 01:50:24,106
It's not good to postpone 
your marriage waiting for him.

1726
01:50:24,647 --> 01:50:27,981
Dad, do you think he can stay 
away from me for so long?

1727
01:50:29,189 --> 01:50:30,356
He will not come back, son.

1728
01:50:30,605 --> 01:50:33,522
No dad, he will definitely come back.

1729
01:50:34,022 --> 01:50:35,647
No he won't ever come back!

1730
01:50:37,398 --> 01:50:40,398
Because he did not leave you 
as he was angry with you.

1731
01:50:47,147 --> 01:50:48,689
That means you know why he left?

1732
01:50:49,363 --> 01:50:51,069
Do you know? Father, do you know why?

1733
01:50:51,269 --> 01:50:51,863
Son...

1734
01:50:52,063 --> 01:50:53,065
You wait...

1735
01:50:54,022 --> 01:50:55,191
Dad, what did you tell him?

1736
01:50:55,435 --> 01:50:57,272
What did you tell him that he left me?

1737
01:50:57,939 --> 01:51:00,522
That day, after Karthik came 
from the police station...

1738
01:51:00,772 --> 01:51:01,605
Hey Karthik...

1739
01:51:02,272 --> 01:51:03,439
Where are you going?

1740
01:51:15,897 --> 01:51:17,897
Grandpa, 
you were right about the horoscope!

1741
01:51:18,231 --> 01:51:23,213
I've overheard Grandma telling uncle 
that there was a bigger danger in store

1742
01:51:23,642 --> 01:51:28,602
That day I went into the pooja room to 
find out the truth in the horoscope.

1743
01:51:38,888 --> 01:51:40,167
A vehicle...

1744
01:51:51,106 --> 01:51:57,100
I was surprised to see the danger my 
uncle might fall into because of me.

1745
01:51:57,543 --> 01:52:00,509
It was also written that the next 
danger was in the form of fire

1746
01:52:00,709 --> 01:52:03,953
And it happened right in front 
of my eyes just within 24 hours

1747
01:52:04,399 --> 01:52:05,872
I understood it then

1748
01:52:06,439 --> 01:52:09,730
Uncle is in grave danger because of me

1749
01:52:14,563 --> 01:52:17,321
Without realising the fact that 
you were trying to protect us...

1750
01:52:17,862 --> 01:52:19,524
...I hurt you badly Grandpa.

1751
01:52:23,022 --> 01:52:24,189
Forgive me Grandpa...

1752
01:52:26,958 --> 01:52:28,022
I am sorry.

1753
01:52:29,522 --> 01:52:30,522
I'll take leave.

1754
01:52:30,939 --> 01:52:32,647
I need to move before uncle is back home.

1755
01:52:33,563 --> 01:52:35,106
But where will you go?

1756
01:52:36,106 --> 01:52:39,522
Uncle left his ambition of 
joining the army because of me.

1757
01:52:39,772 --> 01:52:42,730
No matter how hard, 
I will join the army now.

1758
01:52:45,272 --> 01:52:51,064
Though away from his eyes, I will at least 
try to be close to his dreams, Grandpa.

1759
01:52:51,356 --> 01:52:54,394
But, what will you answer Harika?

1760
01:52:54,797 --> 01:52:56,189
He explain is needed grandma...

1761
01:52:56,439 --> 01:52:59,356
If you can stay away from 
your uncle for his good...

1762
01:52:59,772 --> 01:53:02,897
Then, don't you think I can stay 
away from you for some time?

1763
01:53:51,147 --> 01:53:54,002
Harika told me that Karthik 
called her last from Kashmir.

1764
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,605
So I am here, Sir.

1765
01:53:57,147 --> 01:54:00,814
In a way you are the reason 
for my reunion with my nephew

1766
01:54:01,939 --> 01:54:03,897
I can never forget your help, Sir.

1767
01:54:06,189 --> 01:54:10,398
We are not taking you to your nephew.

1768
01:54:10,981 --> 01:54:13,017
Brigadier asked you to take me to Karthik, 
didn't he?

1769
01:54:13,522 --> 01:54:16,439
The same Brigadier ordered us to 
hold you in custody for two days.

1770
01:54:18,022 --> 01:54:20,605
There is some conspiracy 
spun around your nephew.

1771
01:54:20,855 --> 01:54:22,122
Say it again, Sir.

1772
01:54:22,522 --> 01:54:24,054
Karthik is in some grave danger.

1773
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:28,480
If my nephew is in danger, 
his uncle Venkataratnam is at war, Sir!

1774
01:54:29,939 --> 01:54:30,855
Hey...

1775
01:54:31,055 --> 01:54:32,051
[tyres screeching]

1776
01:54:34,445 --> 01:54:35,631
Hey... Venkatarathnam!

1777
01:54:39,318 --> 01:54:40,253
[indistinctive shouts]

1778
01:54:41,996 --> 01:54:43,098
[tyres screech]

1779
01:54:49,855 --> 01:54:50,917
Call the Brigadier!

1780
01:54:51,876 --> 01:54:53,190
[chopper blades whirring]

1781
01:55:10,564 --> 01:55:11,788
What the hell is happening here?

1782
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:14,787
Do you know whom are 
you pointing the gun at?

1783
01:55:15,113 --> 01:55:15,886
I know!

1784
01:55:16,086 --> 01:55:18,912
There was a time when I wished 
to wear this uniform and hold this gun.

1785
01:55:19,829 --> 01:55:22,745
Now you made me point a 
gun at the same uniform.

1786
01:55:24,003 --> 01:55:26,162
Why are you lying about my nephew?

1787
01:55:30,037 --> 01:55:32,371
You want to know what 
happened to Karthik, do you?

1788
01:55:34,870 --> 01:55:35,464
[bullet fired]

1789
01:55:36,204 --> 01:55:37,620
Gulmarg church massacre...

1790
01:55:38,412 --> 01:55:40,516
this attack was planned and executed by

1791
01:55:40,787 --> 01:55:42,820
the chief of 
Lashkar-e-Mohammed, Abu Usman.

1792
01:55:43,662 --> 01:55:46,538
He is the mastermind behind 
the attacks in Kashmir.

1793
01:55:53,079 --> 01:55:57,162
They did not bother about women or 
children and mercilessly killed 46 people.

1794
01:56:01,265 --> 01:56:06,287
That incident made us cross the border 
leaving aside our 70 years of patience.

1795
01:56:08,745 --> 01:56:10,787
Looking at the track record and training,

1796
01:56:11,121 --> 01:56:16,662
ten excellent Para Commandos have been 
selected who excel in sabotage operations.

1797
01:56:21,077 --> 01:56:24,426
According to our information, there are 
heavily armed and trained terrorists

1798
01:56:25,146 --> 01:56:27,724
We have to neutralize them 
and get Abu Usman alive

1799
01:56:28,245 --> 01:56:30,800
And this operation will be led 
by Captain Karthik Shivaram.

1800
01:56:41,538 --> 01:56:43,496
Are you ready to give an answer 
to 40 years of terrorism?

1801
01:56:44,121 --> 01:56:49,048
And for those who laid 
their lives at the border?

1802
01:56:49,248 --> 01:56:50,191
All: Yes, Sir.

1803
01:56:50,391 --> 01:56:51,533
That border which they cross every day...

1804
01:56:51,733 --> 01:56:53,735
we will show them what happens 
if we cross just once, Sir.

1805
01:56:53,954 --> 01:56:55,995
Then go! Hit them hard!

1806
01:57:00,703 --> 01:57:01,656
Prepare for take-off.

1807
01:57:01,856 --> 01:57:03,289
[chopper blades whirring]

1808
01:57:25,037 --> 01:57:25,912
Approaching LZ

1809
01:57:31,204 --> 01:57:32,329
Decent initiated.

1810
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:29,162
Take all three of them at once.

1811
01:58:29,496 --> 01:58:30,504
Target locked.

1812
01:58:30,937 --> 01:58:31,576
Fire.

1813
01:58:41,329 --> 01:58:42,745
Common boys, move, move!

1814
01:58:42,945 --> 01:58:43,836
[machine gun fire]

1815
01:58:53,121 --> 01:58:55,829
Keep attacking! Nobody should survive! 
[machine gun firing]

1816
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:04,649
Alfa to Charlie...

1817
02:00:04,849 --> 02:00:05,902
Mission accomplished

1818
02:00:06,162 --> 02:00:06,729
Yes!

1819
02:00:06,929 --> 02:00:07,843
Send the chopper

1820
02:00:08,043 --> 02:00:08,914
Reaching pick up point

1821
02:00:09,114 --> 02:00:10,162
Chopper is into action.

1822
02:00:10,308 --> 02:00:11,281
[chopper blades whirring]

1823
02:00:14,112 --> 02:00:14,826
[bullets shot]

1824
02:00:16,329 --> 02:00:17,172
No!

1825
02:00:18,745 --> 02:00:19,839
Boys take cover!

1826
02:00:20,376 --> 02:00:21,183
Take cover!

1827
02:00:25,412 --> 02:00:26,745
-My brother has arrived! 
-Boys, take cover!

1828
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:28,395
-He won't leave anyone alive! 
-Boys, take cover!

1829
02:00:28,595 --> 02:00:29,270
Shut up!

1830
02:00:35,912 --> 02:00:36,815
Take him with you.

1831
02:00:37,015 --> 02:00:38,390
The chopper has come. Go, go, go!

1832
02:00:40,287 --> 02:00:41,329
Go... go... go...

1833
02:00:45,648 --> 02:00:47,299
Move! Come on move!

1834
02:01:06,554 --> 02:01:08,373
Bravo to Charlie... 
Lieutenant Vishal injured Sir.

1835
02:01:08,602 --> 02:01:09,296
What the hell?

1836
02:01:09,496 --> 02:01:10,371
[Karthik groans]

1837
02:01:11,870 --> 02:01:13,086
I'll hold them. Move!

1838
02:01:13,297 --> 02:01:14,242
We will stay with you, Sir!

1839
02:01:14,442 --> 02:01:15,562
You guys move! That's an order.

1840
02:01:15,762 --> 02:01:16,681
-Go! 
-Okay Sir.

1841
02:01:31,204 --> 02:01:32,050
Karthik come on...

1842
02:01:32,703 --> 02:01:33,954
Go, go, go...

1843
02:01:36,912 --> 02:01:39,162
Sir, the enemy's fire is very intense Sir.

1844
02:01:44,079 --> 02:01:45,496
Sir, he is in critical condition.

1845
02:01:45,662 --> 02:01:46,661
-Karthik come on! 
-Come on...

1846
02:01:46,995 --> 02:01:48,066
You guys move...

1847
02:01:50,148 --> 02:01:51,912
It's an order... move... move!

1848
02:01:54,912 --> 02:01:55,982
Karthik Sir stayed back Sir.

1849
02:01:56,412 --> 02:01:57,829
-And on his command we are taking-off. 
-No, no, what the hell...

1850
02:02:01,371 --> 02:02:02,454
Karthik, Karthik come in...

1851
02:02:04,516 --> 02:02:05,586
Brother!

1852
02:02:10,979 --> 02:02:12,942
Karthik, Karthik come back. 
What's happening there?

1853
02:02:13,204 --> 02:02:14,872
Sir mission successful.

1854
02:02:15,265 --> 02:02:16,282
I have a small request.

1855
02:02:16,661 --> 02:02:18,490
My uncle will come searching for me.

1856
02:02:19,538 --> 02:02:22,246
Tell him that his nephew fought 
the country until his last breath.

1857
02:02:22,662 --> 02:02:23,978
No, no Karthik... I can't lose you.

1858
02:02:24,271 --> 02:02:27,162
Hang on, hang on! 
I'm sending in additional force, hang on.

1859
02:02:27,267 --> 02:02:28,071
Jai Hind.

1860
02:02:28,271 --> 02:02:30,075
Karthik! Karthik!

1861
02:02:31,612 --> 02:02:32,236
[screams]

1862
02:02:49,787 --> 02:02:51,724
If Karthik is to return alive

1863
02:02:53,081 --> 02:02:56,609
Razzak put a condition that we have to 
release his brother whom we captured.

1864
02:02:59,112 --> 02:03:00,683
-And that is not possible. 
-Why not, Sir?

1865
02:03:01,391 --> 02:03:03,037
Because Usman is not alive...

1866
02:03:03,610 --> 02:03:04,662
He is dead.

1867
02:03:05,287 --> 02:03:07,829
He died on the way due 
to internal bleeding.

1868
02:03:08,829 --> 02:03:11,787
They will kill Karthik, the very 
moment this news goes out.

1869
02:03:13,037 --> 02:03:15,329
I ordered you to be taken into custody 
because I don't want the news to spread.

1870
02:03:19,829 --> 02:03:23,329
The deadline to exchange Abu Usman 
for Karthik is until tomorrow night.

1871
02:03:24,787 --> 02:03:26,287
Then what Karthik's fate now, Sir?

1872
02:03:27,371 --> 02:03:30,329
We don't even leave a dead 
soldier among enemies.

1873
02:03:30,912 --> 02:03:32,505
Then how can you leave Karthik there?

1874
02:03:32,745 --> 02:03:34,429
Do you think we are doing nothing?

1875
02:03:34,896 --> 02:03:36,902
We are trying everything to save Karthik.

1876
02:03:38,113 --> 02:03:40,662
Army is also a family, 
we just aren't related by blood.

1877
02:03:43,538 --> 02:03:48,538
My blood boils when I see videos 
of Karthik being tortured.

1878
02:03:48,738 --> 02:03:51,211
[Karthik groans]

1879
02:03:53,004 --> 02:03:54,063
[Karthik screams]

1880
02:04:03,703 --> 02:04:05,519
When we can't even save 
our fellow soldier...

1881
02:04:05,746 --> 02:04:07,723
...what's the use of such an army, 
ammunition and training, Sir?

1882
02:04:08,162 --> 02:04:10,668
Are these guns only to shoot 
in the air for those soldiers killed?

1883
02:04:10,868 --> 02:04:11,814
Enough!

1884
02:04:12,371 --> 02:04:13,337
Enough!

1885
02:04:14,496 --> 02:04:16,787
As a Brigadier, 
every soldier's life is my responsibility.

1886
02:04:17,662 --> 02:04:19,287
We tried not once or 
twice but a hundred times.

1887
02:04:19,405 --> 02:04:20,405
But we failed!

1888
02:04:20,995 --> 02:04:22,204
Even now we have a proposal...

1889
02:04:23,547 --> 02:04:26,470
But as a Brigadier, I cannot take any 
emotional decision. I am helpless!

1890
02:04:26,670 --> 02:04:27,566
So, I rejected it.

1891
02:04:27,912 --> 02:04:29,287
Why did you reject it, Sir?

1892
02:04:29,620 --> 02:04:33,009
We can send a soldier disguised as 
Abu Usman to get back Karthik.

1893
02:04:34,454 --> 02:04:36,844
If we attack at the right time, 
we can get Karthik safe.

1894
02:04:37,044 --> 02:04:38,496
But there is a flaw in this plan.

1895
02:04:39,829 --> 02:04:42,371
It is a suicide mission for the 
soldier pretending as Abu Usman.

1896
02:04:43,037 --> 02:04:44,207
He will not return.

1897
02:04:44,954 --> 02:04:47,870
The moment they realise that he is not 
Usman, they'll shower him with bullets.

1898
02:04:49,454 --> 02:04:53,795
It is not morally or ethically correct 
to sacrifice one soldier for another.

1899
02:04:54,037 --> 02:04:55,084
And that's my dilemma.

1900
02:04:55,371 --> 02:04:56,412
I will go, Sir.

1901
02:04:57,645 --> 02:04:58,734
-What? 
-Yes, Sir.

1902
02:04:59,371 --> 02:05:00,620
I can understand your problem.

1903
02:05:01,079 --> 02:05:02,349
You send me dressed like Abu Usman.

1904
02:05:02,549 --> 02:05:03,561
Are you out of your mind?

1905
02:05:03,761 --> 02:05:08,246
If something happens to Karthik, 
two lives will be at stake

1906
02:05:09,412 --> 02:05:13,579
What more do I need than 
atleast saving my nephew, Sir?

1907
02:05:13,662 --> 02:05:16,204
This mission is difficult to handle 
even for a trained commando.

1908
02:05:17,244 --> 02:05:18,995
You don't even know how to fire even a gun

1909
02:05:19,703 --> 02:05:21,287
You don't how to fire a single bullet.

1910
02:05:21,594 --> 02:05:27,246
I might not know how to shoot, 
but I can protect Karthik from any bullet.

1911
02:05:34,496 --> 02:05:35,204
Brother...

1912
02:05:36,717 --> 02:05:40,912
The Indian army has agreed to our 
condition to release Usman Bhai.

1913
02:05:43,087 --> 02:05:47,200
[phone ringing]

1914
02:05:50,264 --> 02:05:50,900
Dad...

1915
02:05:51,496 --> 02:05:52,314
Venkataratnam...

1916
02:05:52,889 --> 02:05:54,438
I am going to meet Karthik today.

1917
02:05:57,371 --> 02:05:58,787
Karthik will come back.

1918
02:05:59,703 --> 02:06:01,662
You have to take care of him from now on.

1919
02:06:02,745 --> 02:06:04,287
You have to get him married.

1920
02:06:04,496 --> 02:06:06,912
Why are you talking like this?

1921
02:06:07,862 --> 02:06:11,079
He should not feel my absence.

1922
02:06:11,371 --> 02:06:12,538
Oh God!

1923
02:06:14,579 --> 02:06:16,411
Son, what happened to you?

1924
02:06:17,303 --> 02:06:18,510
What is happening there?

1925
02:06:19,349 --> 02:06:23,246
You take care, mother. 
Ask the teacher to forgive me.

1926
02:06:23,496 --> 02:06:26,412
Son, just listen to me once.

1927
02:07:41,703 --> 02:07:43,371
Brother...

1928
02:07:50,412 --> 02:07:51,870
Brother...

1929
02:07:57,246 --> 02:07:59,454
Hey! Send my brother alone.

1930
02:08:01,545 --> 02:08:03,412
Nobody should accompany him

1931
02:08:03,662 --> 02:08:05,559
Until the time my nephew 
reaches the cantonment

1932
02:08:05,944 --> 02:08:08,245
Don't let him know I went 
in Usman's place, sir

1933
02:08:51,699 --> 02:08:52,439
[bullet fired]

1934
02:08:55,121 --> 02:08:57,412
Brother!

1935
02:08:57,612 --> 02:08:58,079
[bullet fired]

1936
02:09:01,037 --> 02:09:02,495
Now take his dead body.

1937
02:09:02,743 --> 02:09:04,082
Nephew!

1938
02:09:10,412 --> 02:09:14,662
Uncle...

1939
02:09:29,037 --> 02:09:31,330
They deceived us! 
The man is not our brother

1940
02:09:31,719 --> 02:09:32,337
[groans]

1941
02:09:33,670 --> 02:09:34,720
[roars]

1942
02:09:43,745 --> 02:09:46,079
Uncle...

1943
02:09:47,787 --> 02:09:48,671
Come...

1944
02:09:51,987 --> 02:09:53,127
Karthik...

1945
02:09:59,268 --> 02:10:01,113
Uncle!

1946
02:10:02,831 --> 02:10:04,246
Karthik...

1947
02:10:12,665 --> 02:10:13,958
[roars]

1948
02:10:16,898 --> 02:10:19,289
[roars]

1949
02:11:21,366 --> 02:11:22,567
[machine gun fire]

1950
02:11:49,792 --> 02:11:50,496
Hey!

1951
02:12:03,532 --> 02:12:04,738
[groans] 
Karthik...

1952
02:12:05,085 --> 02:12:05,971
Uncle...

1953
02:12:07,501 --> 02:12:08,646
Karthik..

1954
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:23,980
Uncle...

1955
02:12:24,995 --> 02:12:25,825
Uncle...

1956
02:12:29,703 --> 02:12:32,162
Colonel! Call the air ambulance.

1957
02:12:34,162 --> 02:12:36,204
Why did you come here, Uncle?

1958
02:12:36,496 --> 02:12:40,412
Captain Karthik Shivaram.

1959
02:12:44,454 --> 02:12:46,371
Nothing will happen to you

1960
02:12:46,830 --> 02:12:47,689
I'm here...

1961
02:12:48,678 --> 02:12:50,615
Uncle, no! Uncle!

1962
02:12:51,745 --> 02:12:53,261
Colonel, Colonel!

1963
02:12:53,725 --> 02:12:54,917
Call the air ambulance!

1964
02:12:55,605 --> 02:12:56,674
Uncle, uncle... 
[chopper blades whirring]

1965
02:13:04,318 --> 02:13:06,084
[machine beeping]

1966
02:13:13,272 --> 02:13:14,870
Venkata Ratnam, don't give up.

1967
02:13:15,870 --> 02:13:18,995
You did the impossible, 
you saved your nephew

1968
02:13:19,731 --> 02:13:21,870
All you have to do is 
just bloody breathe!

1969
02:13:22,070 --> 02:13:23,633
[machine beeps]

1970
02:13:24,287 --> 02:13:26,538
Come on Doctor, don't give up... 
keep trying!

1971
02:13:26,738 --> 02:13:28,830
[beep goes flat]

1972
02:13:31,787 --> 02:13:32,798
I am sorry sir.

1973
02:13:54,787 --> 02:13:56,162
Doctor, why did you stop the treatment?

1974
02:13:56,329 --> 02:13:56,951
Doctor, why did you stop...

1975
02:13:57,329 --> 02:13:59,845
Sir, at least tell me why the treatment 
is stopped? Please ask them to continue

1976
02:14:00,121 --> 02:14:01,787
-Please, Sir! 
-Karthik... it's over.

1977
02:14:02,287 --> 02:14:03,861
My uncle has a great heart, Sir.

1978
02:14:04,393 --> 02:14:08,496
A tiny bullet cannot do any harm to him.

1979
02:14:09,329 --> 02:14:10,271
Uncle would be fine.

1980
02:14:10,471 --> 02:14:11,788
Uncle, come on get up...

1981
02:14:13,954 --> 02:14:15,745
Uncle, get up...

1982
02:14:16,454 --> 02:14:19,620
Uncle... get up...

1983
02:14:24,898 --> 02:14:30,884
Didn't you say that love has the 
power to re-write god-written fate?

1984
02:14:31,579 --> 02:14:32,795
Prove that uncle.

1985
02:14:33,037 --> 02:14:34,466
Get up and prove that to be true.

1986
02:14:34,765 --> 02:14:36,008
Please get up, uncle!

1987
02:14:36,144 --> 02:14:37,251
Karthik control yourself.

1988
02:14:37,538 --> 02:14:38,555
How it is possible, sir?

1989
02:14:39,371 --> 02:14:42,662
He taught me everything but 
not how to survive without him.

1990
02:15:01,037 --> 02:15:03,246
Not when my parents died.

1991
02:15:06,132 --> 02:15:08,312
Now that you have left me this moment...

1992
02:15:12,186 --> 02:15:14,538
You made me an orphan now, Uncle.

1993
02:15:17,121 --> 02:15:18,579
You made me an orphan now.

1994
02:15:39,753 --> 02:15:41,367
'Uncle...'

1995
02:15:45,223 --> 02:15:47,294
[machine beeping]

1996
02:15:53,592 --> 02:15:55,115
Come again?

1997
02:16:03,603 --> 02:16:04,615
Uncle...

1998
02:16:06,412 --> 02:16:09,121
Don't say it over and over again, nephew.

1999
02:16:09,496 --> 02:16:11,181
Where would I go leaving you alone?

2000
02:16:11,354 --> 02:16:12,037
Uncle...

2001
02:16:24,881 --> 02:16:29,185
A man's unconditional love is 
beyond planetary positions and palmistry.

2002
02:16:30,058 --> 02:16:32,392
Horoscope is a belief, 
but love is for real.

2003
02:16:32,738 --> 02:16:35,976
And this story is the very proof 
that love can win over anything

2004
02:16:36,543 --> 02:16:39,421
Uncle is the unlimited property 
that comes from mother's side

2005
02:16:39,830 --> 02:16:41,790
Uncle shares the love next to father

2006
02:16:42,466 --> 02:16:47,536
This film of ours is dedicated to the 
loving Uncles and the caring nephews

2007
02:16:48,515 --> 02:16:52,153
[smooching]

2008
02:16:53,001 --> 02:16:53,751
Ah!

2009
02:16:54,121 --> 02:16:55,703
That is why one should 
watch English movies.

2010
02:16:55,954 --> 02:16:56,774
What to do now?

2011
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:01,709
[phone rings]

2012
02:17:02,204 --> 02:17:03,329
Sorry, give me a minute.

2013
02:17:06,662 --> 02:17:07,163
Hey nephew...

2014
02:17:07,363 --> 02:17:08,389
What's it now uncle?

2015
02:17:08,703 --> 02:17:12,121
What can I say? 
I don't know how to start.

2016
02:17:12,204 --> 02:17:13,241
If you could sugest me...

2017
02:17:13,454 --> 02:17:15,912
Uncle! Is this some kind 
of exam to copy from?

2018
02:17:16,112 --> 02:17:17,084
Huh!

2019
02:17:17,862 --> 02:17:18,551
[giggles]

2020
02:17:18,954 --> 02:17:21,131
This is not swimming to teach you.

2021
02:17:21,577 --> 02:17:23,061
You should just go with the flow!

2022
02:17:23,912 --> 02:17:25,521
How do I go with the flow?

2023
02:17:25,787 --> 02:17:26,850
Please don't disturb me anymore.

2024
02:17:27,412 --> 02:17:28,755
Hey, nephew! Ah!

2025
02:17:29,538 --> 02:17:30,870
-Who is it? 
-My nephew.

2026
02:17:31,246 --> 02:17:32,520
He is a junior and I'm the senior...

2027
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:33,466
He is new to this.

2028
02:17:33,666 --> 02:17:35,341
-Not to you? 
-Hey! Hey!

2029
02:17:35,553 --> 02:17:36,107
Teacher.

2030
02:17:36,403 --> 02:17:38,204
It's new... yeah you got me!

2031
02:17:38,662 --> 02:17:39,912
Why did you say that?

2032
02:17:42,162 --> 02:17:43,870
Shall we try now?

2033
02:17:45,861 --> 02:17:47,270
[Karthik screams] 
-Hey nephew!

2034
02:17:47,619 --> 02:17:48,490
Nephew, what happened?

2035
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:50,995
Nephew, what happened? Tell me.

2036
02:17:51,037 --> 02:17:51,620
Uncle...

2037
02:17:51,745 --> 02:17:52,506
What happened?

2038
02:17:52,706 --> 02:17:55,204
-It's nothing... Uncle 
-Then, why are you shouting?

2039
02:17:55,579 --> 02:17:56,604
Oh That is...

2040
02:17:57,454 --> 02:17:58,529
Tell me...

2041
02:17:58,870 --> 02:17:59,514
Love bite.

2042
02:17:59,714 --> 02:18:01,114
Out side? who came from out side? 
Tell me... tell me!

2043
02:18:01,314 --> 02:18:02,377
-Not out side Uncle... 
-I'll tell you.

2044
02:18:02,579 --> 02:18:04,147
Oh no! She will tell you... 
Please tell him.

2045
02:18:05,121 --> 02:18:05,808
What would you say?

2046
02:18:06,037 --> 02:18:07,020
Love bite means...

2047
02:18:07,549 --> 02:18:07,896
Tell me...

2048
02:18:08,096 --> 02:18:09,287
