1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,001
<i>'Singh Saab.'</i>

2
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,074
'Singh Saab.'

3
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,073
'Singh Saab the great.'

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,637
'That's how people
know him these days.'

5
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,237
'Where do I begin?'

6
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,304
'From his childhood.'

7
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,305
'Where, like every other kid...'

8
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,314
'...was thought that,
honesty is the biggest strength.'

9
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,111
'Or the jail?'

10
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,544
'Or Bhadori.'

11
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:13,580
'Or from Chironji,
a small village in eastern UP...'

12
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,070
'...where,
Singh Saab started his life...'

13
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,578
'...in the right way.'

14
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:00,310
The movement begins now.

15
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,213
Jatta Singh's here,
but where's the press?

16
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,676
Forget the press,
here comes righteousness.

17
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,307
Jatta. Better say your prayers.

18
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,170
Singh Saab the Great's here.

19
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,570
Who says the sky can't be pierced?

20
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:49,012
Who says the sky can't be pierced?

21
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,877
Try hurling a stone
with all your might.

22
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,072
Badri.

23
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,539
Distribute the fliers.

24
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:59,607
Jaï¬‚a Singh. My men are worried...

25
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:01,271
...that the press isn't here yet.

26
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,979
I admit that the
press is important...

27
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,372
...but, what's more
important is honesty.

28
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:15,303
Even storms change their course.

29
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,377
Just try lighting
a lamp of righteousness.

30
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,835
Stop this charade.

31
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,177
Otherwise I will
bash your teeth in.

32
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,807
What do you want?

33
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,302
Only betterment.

34
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,113
Big people start big movements...

35
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,908
...in big cities.

36
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:36,277
And, we've some obligations...

37
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,539
...towards the country too.

38
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,274
So, Singh Saab, has started...

39
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,210
...a small movement
in Chironji village.

40
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,979
People's Beat!

41
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,506
I think he didn't gel it.

42
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:50,545
Let me explain.

43
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:53,204
Well, all the small
shopkeepers in this market...

44
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:54,405
...have formed a committee.

45
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:55,537
People's Beat!

46
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,205
We'll encourage such committees...

47
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:58,268
...in every village, every city...

48
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,945
In fact,
in every lane and neighborhood.

49
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,474
And the people will
keep an eye out...

50
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,347
...for anything wrong.

51
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,971
That's all, cleanliness drive.

52
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:11,038
Just like these shopkeepers...

53
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,104
<i>...have</i> piled up all
the adulterated goods...

54
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,305
...from their shop here.

55
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,369
Similarly, you can get...

56
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:21,108
...the adulterated wheat,
rice, kerosene, etcetera...

57
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,703
And pile them up here.

58
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:26,080
And then,
together we'll light them up.

59
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,774
What do you think this is?

60
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,478
But first, who are you?

61
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:34,379
Collector? Politician or a goon?

62
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,375
'Mango People.'

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,274
'Aam Aadmi' (Common Man).

64
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,906
You do know,
mangoes taste a bit sweet and sour.

65
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,279
And 'Peepal'(Banyan).
They're always infested by ghosts.

66
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:47,445
The common man is
also infested by ghosts.

67
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,771
Don't try to provoke them.

68
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,977
Or you will have to pay.

69
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:53,977
Banke!

70
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,373
Jatta Singh.

71
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:13,037
Today is 'Non-Violence Day'.

72
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,403
2nd October. 'Gandhi Jayanti'.

73
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,981
So ...it's better we don't
resort to violence today.

74
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,673
Please lay down your weapons.

75
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:30,278
And then,
let's go unlock your storerooms.

76
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,174
Get lost.

77
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,007
Take it.

78
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,341
Stupid.

79
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,404
Hey man. Take this lad away.

80
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,076
Otherwise,
I will peel the skin off his body.

81
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,708
Get that.

82
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,144
Idiot.

83
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:01,577
Hey!

84
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:10,010
Few kids from the
neighboring village...

85
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,579
...died due to drinking Urea Milk.

86
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,176
You're the biggest supplier...

87
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:21,339
...of Urea Milk in this area.

88
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,776
He's...lying.

89
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,039
He's misleading you.

90
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,340
Beat him!

91
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,670
Guru Gobind Singh has said.

92
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,641
Request the sinners first.

93
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:43,610
Try to explain.

94
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:45,210
But if they still
don't understand...

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,880
...then, pick up the sword...

96
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:56,140
But my arms...are all
I need for dealing with you.

97
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:13,076
I'm a rural man...

98
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,806
...who's studied in a rural school.

99
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,005
And these...are
my countrified arms.

100
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:21,509
When I whack someone...

101
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:26,739
...he soars out of
the stadium like a ball.

102
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,177
So, who else wants
to a taste of this?

103
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:31,143
Come on.

104
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:36,514
Hail of Singh saab!

105
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:30,215
There's a bit of Gandhiji,
a bit of Patel...

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,106
...and a bit of Bhagat Singh in me.

107
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,102
What a friend?

108
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,475
Murli, tell me one thing.

109
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:44,177
Bro's arms weighed 2 V; kilos.

110
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,179
When did it turn 3 'A?

111
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:47,678
What era are you living in?

112
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:51,077
What's the population if India?
- 1.25 billion.

113
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:54,842
That's how much his arms weigh now.

114
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,806
"He's the son Gobind Singh..."

115
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:49,370
"The world calls him brave-heart."

116
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:52,714
"They are never scared..."

117
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:55,543
"Blessed with the
special grace of Lord."

118
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,981
"They dedicate their
life for their honour."

119
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:03,707
"Singh Saab the Great."

120
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,876
"Singh Saab the Great."

121
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,938
"Singh Saab the Great."

122
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,643
"Singh Saab the Great."

123
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,504
"My beloved's so handsome."

124
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,979
"My beloved's so handsome."

125
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,711
"I surrender my life to you."

126
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,043
"I surrender my life to you."

127
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:44,349
"My life asked me
to ask you from God."

128
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,871
"My beloved's so handsome."

129
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,346
"My beloved's so handsome."

130
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,810
It's installed.

131
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,571
You're too proud
of your pretty face.

132
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,306
That's why you
don't like me, right?

133
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:58,444
What are you doing?

134
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:03,775
That was water.

135
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,535
What if it was acid?

136
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:06,868
Would you want to see?

137
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,935
What would've happened to you?

138
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,571
Field clear.

139
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,670
Do you love her?

140
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,941
Win her heart. With love.

141
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:26,910
"Singh Saab The Great."

142
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:32,774
"Singh Saab The Great."

143
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:40,446
"Singh Saab The Great."

144
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:48,934
Take it.

145
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,770
Brother. The computer's flooded...

146
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,608
...with invitations from NGOs.

147
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:56,341
See. Samoha. Roya.

148
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,812
Sangabad. Sitapur.

149
00:14:58,867 --> 00:14:59,845
And...

150
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:04,309
Bhadori!

151
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,270
Weren't you waiting
for this invitation?

152
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,206
We were doing a story...

153
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,439
...on the inmates of Naini jail.

154
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,679
That's where I saw you.

155
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,837
With Jailor Mohammad Iqbal.

156
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:46,645
'Excuse me.'

157
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,179
'One interview. - No.'

158
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:49,671
'Sir, we've been waiting
for a long time.'

159
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,770
'Sorry. Sorry, Sikha. Sorry.'

160
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,879
'Pandey. Take the Mr.
Collector to my Cabin.'

161
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:55,838
'I'll be there soon.'

162
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:57,671
'Collector?

163
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,604
'You mean Saranjeet Talwar...'

164
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:03,304
<i>'...who took a bribe oi Won'</i>

165
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,103
It's surprising.

166
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,336
For the masses,
you're still in jail.

167
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,408
But, you already
came out in <i>1</i> years.

168
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,046
Weren't you sentenced
to 16 years of imprisonment?

169
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,276
Are you misusing your
legal authorities again?

170
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,340
Who let them in?

171
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,346
Get out.
Come on... - We're from the Press.

172
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,107
<i>Shikha Chaturvedi, Tex, Aai Tak.</i>

173
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,570
We want to ask him a few questions.

174
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,037
Go ahead ask.

175
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:55,807
Five of your accomplices...

176
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:58,507
...were also sentenced
to life-imprisonment...

177
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:01,138
...due to your selfish-actions,
I hope you remember.

178
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,544
You managed to get
out using your wits.

179
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,177
But, did you ever think about them?

180
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,212
But, what do you care?

181
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:09,605
There's just one
thing you care about...

182
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,044
...and that's bribe.

183
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:14,245
Have you finished?

184
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,641
Not yet.

185
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,646
New look. New name.

186
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:23,069
Singh Saab.

187
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,310
This charade of social service.

188
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,707
You're really are crime-reporter.

189
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,980
You're thoroughbred to see...

190
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:37,308
...that the glass
is always half empty.

191
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:38,609
Negative.

192
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,339
So that the TRP of
your channel keeps soaring.

193
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,736
<i>1</i> years ago, you journalists...

194
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:51,980
...branded an unfair
decision of the law.

195
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:57,277
And tainted me and my accomplices...

196
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,672
...by continuously showing
it on your channel.

197
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:03,373
I always keep thinking...

198
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:05,504
...about how put an
end to their sufferings.

199
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,671
But you...Did you ever think...

200
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,439
...what their family
might be going through?

201
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:15,138
No!

202
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,206
Because you're only
concerned about your TRP.

203
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:19,177
And you're here today because...

204
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:22,043
...you think you've breaking news.

205
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,640
You're a journalist.

206
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,044
Show some responsibility.

207
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,544
Forget about breaking news...

208
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,240
...and show the truth.

209
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,446
But truth doesn't get TRPs.

210
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,649
Truth is the biggest TRP Mr.
Saranjeet Talwar sir.

211
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:52,271
But there should some truth.

212
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:45,542
"I fell in love.
But I lost all my senses..."

213
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,946
"I know you can
do anything for me."

214
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:55,614
"But I like to see your
head held high with pride."

215
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:58,976
"Don't do it."

216
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:00,477
"Don't do it."

217
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,170
"Don't do it."

218
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,510
Transfer. Transfer. Transfer.

219
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:18,478
I'm fed of your transfers.

220
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,573
Either here or there.

221
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,539
I've to start packing
as soon as I unpack.

222
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,209
What are you doing?

223
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:41,539
Don't I...look like
Dharmendra's son?

224
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:49,579
Am I joking? - No.

225
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,601
Just Love.

226
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:55,069
Try to me serious sometimes.

227
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,980
Minnie, what do you want?

228
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,438
Should I start taking bribes...

229
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,139
...so that I don't
get transferred anymore.

230
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,043
You can do anything you want.

231
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:07,004
But I'm fed up of these transfers.

232
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:08,343
Okay.

233
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,541
She clawed me.

234
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,304
Uncle was right.

235
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,107
There's a big age difference.

236
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,145
Don't get married.

237
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,905
Don't get married.

238
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:17,809
Don't get married.

239
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:19,043
I see.

240
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,412
Then why didn't
you get someone else.

241
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:22,502
Why not?

242
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:24,175
"Why not?"

243
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,776
Can you find such eyes?

244
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,175
Or these lips?

245
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,904
And these...long legs.

246
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:58,314
Mr. Sunny...you
can't stay a moment...

247
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,804
...without Minnie.

248
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,444
"Uncle said..."

249
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,444
Sister-in-law.

250
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,774
Let me take picture.

251
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:07,868
Come on, brother.
- She's always taking pictures.

252
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,879
Yes, one photo.

253
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:12,473
You look so cute.

254
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:13,876
Right. That's enough.

255
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:17,412
Weren't you supposed
to get changed?

256
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,369
You're still wearing his shirt.

257
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:20,275
Look, sister-in-law.

258
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,472
Don't taunt me over
my brother's shirt.

259
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:23,445
You know.

260
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,481
Every time I wear his shirt,
I look like a Collector.

261
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:27,470
Two Collectors!

262
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,012
Yes. You try it too.

263
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,844
Isn't one enough?

264
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,235
We've arrived at the station.

265
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,478
Come on, get changed.

266
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:37,479
Bhadori is your in-law's home.

267
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,007
Ashwini will come to
the station to welcome you.

268
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,843
Sister-in-law. They aren't coming.

269
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,846
I've invited them at the party.

270
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,472
Oh Sunder and munder

271
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,069
Who will Think about you

272
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,373
He is Dulla Bhatti

273
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:52,903
Dulla's daughter got married...
He gave 1kg Sugar...hoyee

274
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,147
I'm throwing a grand
party on your arrival.

275
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,873
And, what about alcohol?

276
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:04,671
Alcohol? - Whiskey.

277
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,946
Why spend so much?

278
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,842
What are you saying?

279
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,243
The entire city should know...

280
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,177
...that Gulvinder Gullu's
childhood friend...

281
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,735
...is returning as the Collector.

282
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,211
Right, sister-in-law?

283
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:15,639
Collector?

284
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,676
I am your peon.

285
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:21,411
Peon. - That's how they are.

286
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:22,309
Peon?

287
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,846
Get the luggage?

288
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:47,983
"Your grace is amazing."

289
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:55,409
"I was floored by your innocence."

290
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:03,809
"God blessed me with one life."

291
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,042
"And...l surrendered that to you."

292
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,310
Here.

293
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,337
Who are you saying it to?

294
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:19,645
Me or this?

295
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,876
Let him drink, sister-in-law.

296
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:24,571
It's a royal taste.

297
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,703
"I don't know what inebriation is."

298
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:36,270
"I'm only crazy
about my sweetheart."

299
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,202
"I don't know what inebriation is."

300
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,840
"I'm only crazy
about my sweetheart."

301
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,107
"I've a small request."

302
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,078
"Old chums have met again."

303
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,908
"Let me drink."

304
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:49,945
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

305
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,035
"From tomorrow... From tomorrow..."

306
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,046
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

307
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,340
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

308
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,674
"From tomorrow...From tomorrow..."

309
00:24:55,734 --> 00:24:56,940
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

310
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:58,973
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

311
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:00,012
"From tomorrow... From tomorrow..."

312
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:02,741
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

313
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:12,273
"I'm a simple guy,
with a simple life."

314
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,049
"I'm a simple guy,
with a simple life."

315
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,276
"I wouldn't drink if it
wasn't for the sentiment inside."

316
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,635
"Make me a peg."

317
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,576
"Make me a peg."

318
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:29,271
"Make me a peg from your eyes."

319
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,812
"No more drinking."

320
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:32,642
"No more drinking."

321
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:34,971
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

322
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,103
"From tomorrow... From tomorrow..."

323
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,612
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

324
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:39,602
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

325
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:40,702
"From tomorrow... From tomorrow..."

326
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:42,747
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

327
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,737
"I've written a sonnet
in your praise."

328
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,677
"Wow. Let's hear it."

329
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,812
"The radiance of
your beauty is amazing."

330
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:25,909
"It turns my dusks into dawns."

331
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:35,673
"I feel breathless..."

332
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,180
"...when you fling your tresses."

333
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:45,512
"Brother."

334
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,872
"Brother, you were just amazing."

335
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:51,106
"You made sister-in-law
yearn for me."

336
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:53,610
"Here we go.".

337
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,669
"I've written a sonnet
in your praise."

338
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:58,407
"I've seen God in you."

339
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:04,670
"I've written a sonnet
in your praise."

340
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,940
"I've seen God in you."

341
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,139
"Look into my eyes."

342
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,544
"You dwell in my heart."

343
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,511
"Say yes. Say yes."

344
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,569
"I've finally decided that..."

345
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,634
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

346
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,701
"From tomorrow... From tomorrow..."

347
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:18,973
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

348
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:21,008

356
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

357

00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,546
"I'm only crazy
about my sweetheart."

359

"I've a small request."

360
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,980
"Old chums have met again."

361
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:44,740
"Let me drink."

362
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,870
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

363
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:46,877
"From tomorrow... From tomorrow..."

364
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,469
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

"No more drinking from tomorrow."

366
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:51,569
"From tomorrow... From tomorrow..."

367
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:52,873
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

368
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:54,975
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

369
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:56,012
"From tomorrow... From tomorrow..."

370
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,478
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

371
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,372
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

372
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:00,571
"From tomorrow... From tomorrow..."

373
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:01,805
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

374
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:03,871
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

375
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:04,968
"From tomorrow... From tomorrow..."

376
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:06,444
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

377
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:08,468
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

378
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:09,603
"From tomorrow... From tomorrow..."

379
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:12,307
"No more drinking from tomorrow."

380
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:52,576
Don't drink so much.

381
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,775
It damages the liver.

382
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,605
Will you do something for me,
Minnie?

383
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:05,010
You pray to God, don't you?

384
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:09,505
So tell Him tomorrow...

385
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:12,511
In the next life...

386
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:13,705
"In the next life..."

387
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,473
In the next life...

388
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,707
Bless your Sunny...

389
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:25,877
With two livers.

390
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:28,735
What?

391
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:32,005
You...

392
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,774
I won't spare you.

393
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:43,837
Stop it.

394
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:17,915
"The moon asked me one day."

395
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:24,545
"Have you ever
seen anyone like me?"

396
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:32,844
"I replied with a smile."

397
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:40,780
"Have you seen my sweetheart?"

398
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:46,872
"Have you seen my sweetheart?"

399
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:52,749
"Have you seen my sweetheart?"

400
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:01,807
"I heard a whisper..."

401
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:02,937
Sister-in-law.

402
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:04,678
Where are you? - Brother?

403
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,770
I am ruined.

404
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:10,246
My own friend,
the Collector, ruined me.

405
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,745
What's wrong, brother Gullu?

406
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,280
Here. - You can't imagine
what has happened.

407
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:15,676
Murli, tell
sister-in-law everything.

408
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:16,643
See, sister-in-law.

409
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,509
He's been served a notice.

410
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:20,843
His career's been destroyed.

411
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,607
What's so funny?

412
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:24,913
See. He's written...

413
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,938
"Product not up to the mark."

414
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,769
"And evasion of excise duty.

415
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,940
But brother, isn't it true?

416
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,812
Speak up, isn't it all true?

417
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:36,945
You do.

418
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,370
Sister-in-law.

419
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,435
He can't sleep without doing it.

420
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,244
I've a cure for that.

421
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,473
I'll make buttermilk for you two.

422
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:47,775
Why you...

423
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:48,868
What are you doing?

424
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:50,379
I guess the CM won't help.

425
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:51,538
We'll have to approach the PM.

426
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,938
Guddi.

427
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,880
"My sweet sister's
going to be a bride."

428
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,877
I found you such a
handsome suitor, right?

429
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:01,470
Let's get to the point. - Yes.

430
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:02,808
Please help me out.

431
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:05,347
I swear,
Hake a pill every morning...

432
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,344
...for blood pressure.

433
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,674
Today I took two.

434
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:08,712
The third one's here.

435
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:09,802
Keep it back.

436
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:11,574
Save me from this tax and BP.

437
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,169
Call your brother. Please.

438
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:15,839
Brother Gullu,
I cannot call brother right now.

439
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,607
The court's in session outside.

440
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:19,674
Is he a Collector or a Judge?
- Collector.

441
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:21,872
But, once a week
he meets the people.

442
00:32:22,267 --> 00:32:23,837
He calls it 'Mass-hearing Day'.

443
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:25,578
And I've heard that he...

444
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:27,477
...never spares those
who are involved in scams.

445
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:29,240
Why don't you tell him?
- Yes, of course.

446
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,644
Brother Gullu, don't delay anymore.

447
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,872
It's my brother's court.

448
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:34,640
Justice is never denied.

449
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,872
Everyone receives fair trial.

450
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,578
I see. - Ashwini.

451
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:38,839
Hello. Ashwini.

452
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,711
Now, only Gabbar can save me...

453
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:42,871
...from Gabbaï¬‚s wrath.

454
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:46,843
Gabbar Gupta,
that retailer will save you.

455
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,436
I said Gabbar.

456
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,869
Don't you know Gabbar?
- Who's Gabbar?

457
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:53,773
Don't you know Gabbar? - No.

458
00:32:54,234 --> 00:32:56,111
Sambha? - Sambha, who?

459
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,505
Kaalia. - Kaalia who?
Have you lost it?

460
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,542
'Sholay.' - Right.

461
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,238
I had it this morning with rice.

462
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,804
I'll give you a whack.

463
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,571
What happened?
- The Collector's Gabbar.

464
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:09,135
And you're Sambha.

465
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,372
And I am Kaalia.

466
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:12,309
Then, don't just stand there.

467
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,607
I'll take you to Ramgarh.

468
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,476
"We-n never..."

469
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:16,477
Let's go.

470
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,211
Hey. Where?

471
00:33:18,434 --> 00:33:20,038
Sir... - I'm right behind you.

472
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,111
Wait for me.

473
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,147
He's a... - Wait.

474
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,277
Next.

475
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,073
Rampal.

476
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,804
Rampal.

477
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,170
Who's Rampal? - Yes.

478
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:35,745
Hurry up. Dozing off.

479
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,340
Hello.

480
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:49,075
What's this? - Bribe?

481
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,578
Have you lost your mind?

482
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:54,441
Take it back. - Hold on.

483
00:33:58,467 --> 00:33:59,104
Why?

484
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:01,078
Sir, I borrowed 40,000...

485
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:04,105
...for the Government
bank to buy a buffalo.

486
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:05,669
I did get the money.

487
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:08,670
But the manager took 8000 rupees.

488
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,576
The senior officer swindled 6000.

489
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:15,037
And the junior
officer snatched 3000.

490
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,242
I can't buy a buffalo
with the remaining money.

491
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,509
So I thought, I'll be satisfied...

492
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,478
...if this can make you happy.

493
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:27,680
Because everyone says that...

494
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,474
...you have a share too.

495
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,975
I will endure everything
until I've the courage.

496
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:37,514
Otherwise,
I'll hang myself from the noose...

497
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:39,444
...just like the other farmers.

498
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,643
Goodbye. - Wait.

499
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:56,976
Tyagi. Take immediate
action against the accused. - Sir.

500
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,936
Send a circular
to every department.

501
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,407
If any government officer
is caught taking a bribe...

502
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:03,469
...he should remember,
this is Saranjeefs court.

503
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,408
Justice is never denied here.

504
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,407
Judgement is passed, on the spot.

505
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:09,978
Whether he's a kin or not.

506
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,610
Keep this.

507
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,406
You will receive your
entire amount in 24 hours.

508
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:25,671
Come, Mr. Gulvinder Singh.

509
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,644
Come.

510
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,270
See, he's calling me.

511
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,677
Why did you stop me? - Go.

512
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,671
You're doing a wonderful job, sir.

513
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:32,105
A wonderful job.

514
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:33,503
I'm obliged.

515
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,240
Sir, you're doing wonderful job.

516
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,108
Where's his file?

517
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:36,975
Here.

518
00:35:41,234 --> 00:35:43,646
Rs.21,32,151

519
00:35:45,634 --> 00:35:47,170
That's the excise
duty you've to pay.

520
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,974
Pay it soon.

521
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:51,177
I had a word with
the excise officer.

522
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:52,269
He'll give you a rebate.

523
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,111
You'll get a rebate.

524
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,875
He's talking about
rebate after ruining me.

525
00:35:58,234 --> 00:35:59,508
You will really have to regret...

526
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:01,308
...if you don't pay on time.

527
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:01,970
No, no, no.

528
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,536
He'll pay up.
He's got money in the bank.

529
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,601
It's not for squandering.

530
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,941
It was no joke earning it.

531
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,447
I worked hard day and night,
understand.

532
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,275
I couldn't see my children grow up.

533
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:12,945
Suddenly I see them all grown up.

534
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,002
I turned dark working
day and night.

535
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:17,172
Otherwise, I was really fair.
Ask him.

536
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:18,541
He was always dark.

537
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,271
You remember my colour,
but not my friendship.

538
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,874
Tyasi- - Sir.

539
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,435
If he doesn't pay up in <i>1</i> days...

540
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:28,104
...then issue an arrest
warrant against him.

541
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:29,976
He'll get you arrested.

542
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:30,568
Arrest!

543
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:31,935
Thank you very much.

544
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:34,477
Can you arrest only those...

545
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:36,445
...who are helpless
and pay their taxes.

546
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,945
Or, can you arrest them too?

547
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,972
The ruler of Bhadori,
the influential, King Bhudev Singh.

548
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,377
The kingpin of crimes.

549
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:46,379
He runs all the illegal business'.

550
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:49,614
Land mafia.
Sand mafia. Prostitution.

551
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,305
The head of the kidnapper's gang.

552
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,244
He also owns illegal breweries.

553
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,576
He doesn't pay a single penny tax.

554
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:59,206
There's no law, no arrest for him.

555
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:01,304
We're the only
ones to get arrested.

556
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:04,075
Stop dancing.
- He's saying something.

557
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:06,836
This is the court. - Sorry.

558
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,139
Bhudev has been served notice.

559
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:13,979
The orders to lockdown
his factories have been given.

560
00:37:53,467 --> 00:37:56,004
Daata sir's here. Open the gate.

561
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:34,104
You can't get admission
without donation...

562
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:35,305
...in Daata sir's college.

563
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,037
Mr. Srivastav,
you're a family man yourself.

564
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,976
You can understand.

565
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:40,035
How can they pay donation?

566
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,011
It's difficult for
them to even pay their fee.

567
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:43,102
Won't they mint money...

568
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:45,169
...after they become doctors,
engineers, officers?

569
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:48,044
If it's difficult for them...

570
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,341
...then let them sell
their ancestral homes.

571
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:52,303
Few good students
will benefit from it.

572
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:58,107
Bhawar Singh.
What about the Collector?

573
00:38:58,434 --> 00:38:59,412
Hasn't he arrived yet?

574
00:39:00,267 --> 00:39:01,337
Take a look.

575
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:04,707
Maybe he's still basking
in his wife's arms.

576
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,338
Minnie!

577
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,004
Where's my tie and coat?

578
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,272
Minnie. Where's my tie and coat?

579
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,271
When you knew,
that Ashwini's parents...

580
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,142
...are coming over
to fix the wedding date...

581
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:25,276
...then why did you have
to call these goons over.

582
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,202
Why are you smiling?

583
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,210
Why don't you ever try to relax?

584
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,871
Listen to me. My pretty woman.

585
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:37,412
Why don't you understand?

586
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:42,142
I'm a government servant
who works for 24/1.

587
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,081
Why do you forget,
that...your husband's a Collector.

588
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,801
Collector?

589
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,144
Collector?

590
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,836
I am your peon.

591
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:01,411
Peon.

592
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,938
I know how much you love me.

593
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:08,378
You're working even on my birthday.

594
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,877
You're never there for
our wedding anniversary.

595
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:14,011
And, you crossed all
limits on this 'Karva Chaulh'.

596
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:15,276
You kept saying...

597
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:17,904
...break your fast
with my photo on Skype.

598
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,840
What a husband?

599
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:23,413
Oh, God! What do I do?

600
00:40:23,934 --> 00:40:24,844
Love me.

601
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:27,175
Love.

602
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:28,907
I'll show you what love is.

603
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:30,844
Oh, God!
It would've been so much better...

604
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,407
...if I hadn't gone to your office...

605
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,838
...with the water
problems in my school.

606
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,709
And the tea would've
never fallen on my clothes.

607
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,842
I wouldn't have gone
in the washroom to clean it.

608
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,345
And, I wouldn't have
hit you on the head...

609
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,845
...with the bathroom
door while opening it...

610
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,213
And our eyes wouldn't have met,
nor us...

611
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:49,204
That would've been better.

612
00:40:49,934 --> 00:40:51,777
At least I wouldn't have
been a Collector's wife.

613
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:56,041
Uncle was right.

614
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:58,311
There's a huge
difference in the age.

615
00:40:58,367 --> 00:40:59,175
Don't marry her.

616
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,338
Don't marry her.

617
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:05,210
Why do you keep mentioning
your uncle al the time.

618
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:07,179
He passed away long ago.

619
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:09,111
Here's your tie and coat.

620
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:10,807
Sister-in-law.

621
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,837
Stand here.

622
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,703
One minute.

623
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:14,041
Let me take a picture.

624
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,976
Mine, too.

625
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:15,671
Yes.

626
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:20,969
Boss. Collector sir.

627
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:22,642
Hello.

628
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,340
Hello. - He's Daata Bhudev Singh.

629
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,678
His ancestors have
ruled Bhadoria for ages.

630
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,571
You should know that...

631
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,212
...people think twice
before saying anything to him.

632
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,574
He owns this city.

633
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,946
So, now the dogs will
introduce their master.

634
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:48,804
No, Mr. Collector.

635
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,006
The master will
show who the dog is.

636
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:54,339
Is the meat enough?

637
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:55,839
Or, should I throw
some bones as well?

638
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,844
How much do you want?

639
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,274
Rs.32, <i>38,</i> 13,00ocr.

640
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,004
Pay this excise duty.

641
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:06,705
You have seven days.

642
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,902
L...pay excise!

643
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:13,577
I only take.

644
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:16,274
I am the law and the lawmaker here.

645
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,271
I am Bhudev.

646
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,108
The lord of ghosts.

647
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:24,042
Come on, withdraw the notice
and release my factories.

648
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,910
Otherwise... - Otherwise what?

649
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:34,005
You've seen a calm Bhudev.

650
00:42:34,767 --> 00:42:36,906
Not the angry one.

651
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:46,570
Here.

652
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:47,977
Go ahead.

653
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,108
Go ahead.

654
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:03,918
When the time comes,
you won't get a chance to fend.

655
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:06,974
You've the time and chance.

656
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:11,477
Either mend your
ways or leave this city.

657
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:14,002
Choice is yours.

658
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:19,537
Leave this city?

659
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:23,948
This post of a Collector
you're so arrogant about...

660
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,041
...is just 300 years old.

661
00:43:27,633 --> 00:43:30,773
But we...have existed
her for thousands of years...

662
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:32,005
...and, will continue doing so.

663
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,710
I'll show you.

664
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,202
A king's always a
king and a servant's...

665
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,638
...always a servant.

666
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:44,204
And yes!

667
00:43:45,967 --> 00:43:48,811
You're getting your sister
married in this city, aren't you?

668
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,641
Do ill Do ill Do ill

669
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,804
Hey!

670
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:38,876
If you try to ruin
my sister's happiness...

671
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:45,544
...you'll be missing a head.

672
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,512
Go tell the CM to
get me transferred.

673
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,569
No!

674
00:45:00,134 --> 00:45:00,942
No transfer.

675
00:45:02,134 --> 00:45:03,738
Only cowards do that.

676
00:45:06,034 --> 00:45:06,944
No transfer.

677
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,408
Like I said.

678
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:13,007
A king's always a
king and a servant's...

679
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:14,812
...always a servant.

680
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,036
I'll keep you right here.

681
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:24,548
Under my shoe.

682
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,609
You'll suffer.

683
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,671
Wail like a baby...

684
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,878
...saying "Why didn't
I listen to him".

685
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,609
Don't ever make that mistake,
Bhudev.

686
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:50,509
If Collector Saranjeet
Talwar stays here...

687
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,543
...then you'll be
buried under the earth.

688
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:16,344
No, no, but...

689
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,377
...how can the wedding
be possible so soon?

690
00:46:21,534 --> 00:46:24,515
I mean...
the wedding arrangements...

691
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:25,938
...clothes, jewelry.

692
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,839
We want to get her
married in a grand way.

693
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,243
You're absolutely right.

694
00:46:30,567 --> 00:46:33,377
But, there's no other
date in the coming months.

695
00:46:33,967 --> 00:46:35,469
No, no, but so soon...

696
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,574
Sister-in-law.

697
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:40,410
Clothiers,
jewelers, musicians, lighting...

698
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:41,741
...will be standing at your door.

699
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,644
Yes, they'll be standing
at your door, hands folded.

700
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:02,936
Guddi.

701
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,901
WM' are you crying?

702
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,675
Your brother's there.

703
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,411
Just watch how grand
your Wedding's going to be.

704
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,240
Everyone will be amazed.

705
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:17,939
No, brother.
I don't want to get married.

706
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,877
I want to stay with you.

707
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,741
I won't leave you.

708
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,376
I won't go.

709
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:28,211
I won't go.

710
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:42,611
Lallan's coming
with the police force.

711
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:44,903
The Collector's
sent another notice.

712
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,840
Hello, Boss.

713
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,277
Papa... - My child.

714
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:50,778
Where are you going?

715
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:53,838
Bye, Papa.
I'm going to school. - Bye.

716
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:55,868
Hold on, dear.

717
00:47:55,934 --> 00:47:57,345
What happened, papa?

718
00:47:57,767 --> 00:47:59,144
What's this?

719
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:02,778
Go on.

720
00:48:03,334 --> 00:48:04,278
Be careful.

721
00:48:04,334 --> 00:48:05,540
Bye, papa.

722
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,841
Boss. The Collector has revoked...

723
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,436
...all our weapons license.

724
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:19,342
He's sent the SP to
collect all the weapons.

725
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:21,875
Daata sir. I am sorry.

726
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:23,145
We can't do anything.

727
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,343
Look...we're helpless.

728
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,871
Rascal. You dare
hit a police officer.

729
00:48:39,267 --> 00:48:40,371
What have you done, Daata sir?

730
00:48:41,267 --> 00:48:42,439
You shot an officer.

731
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,270
Slapped the SP.

732
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:46,474
If the media finds out about this...

733
00:48:46,534 --> 00:48:48,707
wand, if the SP's wife
resorts to hunger-strike...

734
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:50,678
...do you know how grave
the situation will get?

735
00:48:50,933 --> 00:48:52,412
We'll have to arrest you.

736
00:48:52,467 --> 00:48:54,105
Shut up, CM.

737
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,275
I know all your secrets.

738
00:48:58,567 --> 00:48:59,739
If I reveal them...

739
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,041
...you'll lose your
post and your power.

740
00:49:02,334 --> 00:49:03,540
And the people won't
spare you either.

741
00:49:03,867 --> 00:49:07,679
I have 21 MLAs and 5 MPs.

742
00:49:07,734 --> 00:49:09,805
I'll still be in power.

743
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:11,813
Daata sir.

744
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:14,569
We've an old relation.

745
00:49:14,634 --> 00:49:17,171
I was only trying to
explain you the situation.

746
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:19,312
Don't worry.

747
00:49:19,767 --> 00:49:21,610
The DG's sitting here.

748
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,404
I'll handle everything.

749
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,510
I know...that Collector's
has bothered you a lot.

750
00:49:26,567 --> 00:49:27,739
I'll get him transferred.

751
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,642
No!

752
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:30,545
No transfer.

753
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,535
No transfer.

754
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,205
I'll maul him under my shoe.

755
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:40,374
Don't be so stubborn, Daata sir.

756
00:49:40,434 --> 00:49:43,813
I am not a politician
to change sides with time.

757
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,772
I am a king.

758
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:47,744
I am stubborn.

759
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:51,646
You just mislead the government.

760
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,209
I'll do whatever needs to be done.

761
00:49:58,167 --> 00:49:59,475
What else can I do when...

762
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:00,478
...the people don't vote for me.

763
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:02,710
I've to take orders
from such goons.

764
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,740
Let the public pay for it.

765
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,804
Getting your son married
to the Collector's sister are you?

766
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,237
I'll riddle your head with bullets.

767
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,644
When is the marriage?

768
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:17,802
Daata sir.

769
00:50:17,867 --> 00:50:19,710
We'll call off the wedding, sir.

770
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,508
Why will you do that?

771
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,772
Great. You excused the Collector?

772
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:28,336
He's a good man. - Shut up!

773
00:50:29,267 --> 00:50:32,077
If your father hadn't raised me...

774
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:34,540
...then, I would've tied
you with the buffaloes.

775
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:37,208
And why not.

776
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:40,108
You're forming an allegiance
with the Collector.

777
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:42,640
Now, no one can harm you.

778
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,406
He'll be heavily guarded.

779
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,240
Police. Military.
Metal detectors. Everything.

780
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:53,112
Bullets,
daggers, nothing can harm him.

781
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,170
You're an important man now.

782
00:50:55,234 --> 00:50:56,406
This is why I called you?

783
00:50:56,867 --> 00:50:57,538
Lallan.

784
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,237
Yes.

785
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:01,741
Isn't there a ritual
of feeding sweets...

786
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,406
...to the bride and groom.

787
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,512
Mix this with the sweets...

788
00:51:08,434 --> 00:51:11,210
...and feed it to
the Collector's sister.

789
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:15,439
If you don't,
and tell this to the Collector...

790
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,537
...or anyone else?

791
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,474
Then I will feed this...

792
00:51:19,767 --> 00:51:23,146
...to your daughter,
son-in-law and grandson.

793
00:51:29,334 --> 00:51:32,611
Daata sir. What's in this?

794
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:35,744
Poison.

795
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,070
"Look...Look...Look...
your beautiful looks."

796
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:58,013
"Look look look...your
dress hook"

797
00:51:58,267 --> 00:52:01,441
Whats in your
heart...Should I Tell

798
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,674
Hey Beautiful just wait wait wait

799
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:08,181
"When the henna's adorned."

800
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:11,680
"Sister-in-law singing the song,
everybody join the floor."

801
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:21,173
"When the henna's adorned."

802
00:52:21,233 --> 00:52:24,146
"When the brides' all adorned."

803
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,511
"The nights become restless."

804
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:34,048
"When the henna's adorned."

805
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:37,211
"When the brides' all adorned."

806
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:40,578
"The nights become restless."

807
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:44,480
"Your image dwells in the eyes."

808
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:47,070
"I can see nothing else."

809
00:52:47,134 --> 00:52:50,581
"The nights become restless."

810
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,537
"The nights become restless."

811
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,275
"The nights become restless."

812
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,944
"The stud on the earring
glitters bright."

813
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,140
"Steal his eyes with your look."

814
00:53:33,534 --> 00:53:36,913
"The stud on the earring
glitters bright."

815
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:40,210
"Steal his eyes with your look."

816
00:53:40,267 --> 00:53:43,373
"The bangles clinker."

817
00:53:43,434 --> 00:53:46,506
"My heart's bonded with yours."

818
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:50,071
"Come on everyone...sing
and dance."

819
00:53:50,134 --> 00:53:53,081
"The beat's rocking...dance a jig."

820
00:53:53,134 --> 00:53:56,809
"Se! the dance floor on fire."

821
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:59,279
"Make the DJ play this song again."

822
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:03,180
"The nights become restless."

823
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:06,009
"The nights become restless."

824
00:54:06,067 --> 00:54:09,810
"The nights become restless."

825
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,070
"My beloved with
those mesmerizing eyes."

826
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,374
"My beloved with
those mesmerizing eyes."

827
00:54:29,434 --> 00:54:32,540
"I want to elope with you."

828
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,938
"I'm floored by you."

829
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,072
"I'm completely out of mind."

830
00:54:39,134 --> 00:54:42,513
"When the eyes meet."

831
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:45,345
"It creates uproar."

832
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,904
"The nights become restless."

833
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:52,011
"The nights become restless."

834
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:55,537
"The nights become restless."

835
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,471
"When the henna's adorned."

836
00:54:58,967 --> 00:55:01,880
"When the brides' all adorned."

837
00:55:01,934 --> 00:55:05,780
"The nights become restless."

838
00:56:50,334 --> 00:56:52,405
Are you going to feed
your daughter-in-law too?

839
00:56:52,467 --> 00:56:53,707
Come on, feed me.

840
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:57,313
No one's offering me.

841
00:57:30,734 --> 00:57:31,337
Where is it?

842
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,903
Where did you keep it?
- I kept the box right here.

843
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,072
No one will eat.

844
00:57:38,134 --> 00:57:39,306
Put down your plates.

845
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,870
No one will eat, please.

846
00:57:40,934 --> 00:57:42,208
No one will eat.

847
00:57:42,267 --> 00:57:43,211
Sir, call for you.

848
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:44,345
Bhudev.

849
00:57:45,067 --> 00:57:46,171
Where are you?

850
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:48,277
I will kill you.

851
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:55,943
You will, but I already have.

852
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,241
And the blow's so severe.

853
00:57:58,567 --> 00:58:02,913
You're going to suffer.

854
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,679
Rascal.

855
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:09,511
I wanted to add
poison in your life.

856
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:12,714
My man's already done the job.

857
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:14,571
Take a look around.

858
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:45,779
Hi, Minnie. - Hi.

859
00:58:45,834 --> 00:58:47,745
Congratulations. - Thanks.

860
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,279
How are you? - Fine!

861
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,910
Nice preparations!

862
00:58:50,967 --> 00:58:51,775
Thank you very much.

863
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:53,507
Where's Saranjeet? - There...

864
01:00:08,267 --> 01:00:17,711
"My love, when I fell in love..."

865
01:00:21,267 --> 01:00:29,618
"I've forgotten the world."

866
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,605
Be careful.

867
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,674
Sister-in-law.

868
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,710
Why the electricity is off?

869
01:00:42,767 --> 01:00:43,973
Seems like the
transformeï¬‚s shorted.

870
01:00:44,234 --> 01:00:45,907
Ask them to start the generator.

871
01:00:45,967 --> 01:00:47,947
How can you start the generator?

872
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,702
Here. Data's on-line. Talk to him.

873
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,605
What kind of an administration
are you running?

874
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:08,544
No electricity in hospitals.

875
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,471
You always interfere
in other's problems.

876
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,575
First solve your own problems.

877
01:01:13,634 --> 01:01:14,806
Why are you talking on the phone?

878
01:01:14,867 --> 01:01:15,709
Show yourself.

879
01:01:15,767 --> 01:01:17,144
Stop threatening me.

880
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,474
Come and kill me.

881
01:01:18,534 --> 01:01:20,707
I am in Delhi, come kill me.

882
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,713
But your wife will be dead by then.

883
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,139
Wrong decision.

884
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:30,144
Like I said...I'll make you suffer,
I'll make you cry.

885
01:01:30,434 --> 01:01:33,074
I'll maul you under my feel.

886
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:36,574
Do as I say now.

887
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:39,443
Bhawar Singh.
Get us out of this lift.

888
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:49,443
How's my wife?
- Sir. We've flushed out...

889
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,843
...the poison as much as we could.

890
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,675
Shifted the patient to ICU.

891
01:01:52,934 --> 01:01:54,743
But a large part of her intestine...

892
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,438
...has been scorched
due to corrosive poisoning.

893
01:01:57,067 --> 01:01:58,410
Once conscious, the patient...

894
01:01:58,467 --> 01:01:59,946
...will experience unbearable pain.

895
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,840
To save her we need to
perform immediate surgery.

896
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,538
Then get the surgery done.

897
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,580
Sir, this is highly
specialized surgery.

898
01:02:07,634 --> 01:02:10,012
Only Surgeon Anand can do it.
- Then call Dr. Anand.

899
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:11,571
Sir, we're trying to contact him...

900
01:02:11,634 --> 01:02:12,704
...but, we're not
getting him on the line.

901
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:13,837
Get Dr. Anand?

902
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,071
But...

903
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,075
His son's been kidnapped, Mr.
Collector.

904
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,846
Where's Dr. Anand?

905
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,641
Collector sir.

906
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,680
There's no point in strangling him.

907
01:02:28,734 --> 01:02:30,907
Dr. Anand's will
perform the operation.

908
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,438
Where's Dr. Anand?

909
01:02:36,134 --> 01:02:39,343
Dr. Anand will first save his son...

910
01:02:40,034 --> 01:02:43,038
...and then perform the
surgery on sister-in-law.

911
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,704
Let go off my neck.

912
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:46,974
So...are you having fun yet?

913
01:02:47,034 --> 01:02:50,072
Rascal. I won't spare you.

914
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:51,613
If anything happens
to my sister-in-law...

915
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,572
...I will skin you alive.

916
01:02:53,634 --> 01:02:55,978
Ashwini, take her away.

917
01:02:56,034 --> 01:02:57,308
Let's go.

918
01:02:57,367 --> 01:02:58,311
I will kill him.

919
01:02:58,367 --> 01:02:59,903
Sister-in-law is struggling.

920
01:03:00,534 --> 01:03:02,013
Regretting now, aren't you?

921
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:04,305
Why did you listen to me before?

922
01:03:04,767 --> 01:03:06,804
What do you want?

923
01:03:07,467 --> 01:03:08,605
Goodbye.

924
01:03:08,667 --> 01:03:10,408
Now you get it.

925
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,880
Sultan. - Yes, sir.

926
01:03:13,934 --> 01:03:16,540
Give him a tight
slap on his cheeks.

927
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,776
If I don't carry out
the master's orders...

928
01:03:37,834 --> 01:03:39,871
What are you waiting for? Slap me.

929
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,002
Slap me now!

930
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:59,440
SimarmWait. - Let me go.

931
01:04:08,734 --> 01:04:12,580
Daata sir. Did you hear that?

932
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,837
There's one score
yet to be settled.

933
01:04:17,867 --> 01:04:19,813
I've to severe his arms.

934
01:04:21,734 --> 01:04:24,840
Lawyer. Severe his arms.

935
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,311
Here you go, Mr. Collector.

936
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,176
The release orders
for the factories.

937
01:04:29,434 --> 01:04:31,471
And this is an apology note.

938
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,740
Sigh here.

939
01:04:33,567 --> 01:04:35,672
You must be wondering...

940
01:04:35,934 --> 01:04:38,574
...whether to save your
honesty or your wife.

941
01:04:39,467 --> 01:04:42,471
What goods your honesty.

942
01:04:42,534 --> 01:04:44,536
Your wife won't come back to life.

943
01:04:44,867 --> 01:04:47,643
You can earn your respect
back sooner or later.

944
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,877
Save your wife first.

945
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,413
'You must be wondering...'

946
01:04:57,467 --> 01:05:00,539
'...whether to save
your honesty or your wife.'

947
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,604
'What goods your honesty.'

948
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:05,704
'Your wife won't
come back to life.'

949
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:08,771
'You can earn your respect
back sooner or later.'

950
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:11,176
'Save your wife first.'

951
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:14,238
'I promise to protect my wife...'

952
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,577
'...under every circumstances.'

953
01:05:17,634 --> 01:05:21,514
'I accept her with this promise.'

954
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:24,638
'I promise to protect my wife...'

955
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:28,614
'...under every circumstances.'

956
01:05:28,867 --> 01:05:33,867
"Your beautiful face..."

957
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:52,279
"...the day I saw you."

958
01:05:56,867 --> 01:06:04,581
"I became your fan."

959
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:14,583
"I forgot the world."

960
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,340
Dr. Anand.

961
01:06:56,533 --> 01:06:57,671
Where is she? - In the ICU.

962
01:06:57,734 --> 01:06:58,644
Come, doctor. - Let's go.

963
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,378
Brother.

964
01:07:14,134 --> 01:07:15,169
Excuse me, sir.

965
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:16,644
Sir.

966
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,444
Dr. Anand's calling you.

967
01:07:27,767 --> 01:07:28,541
Sorry.

968
01:07:29,467 --> 01:07:33,040
I could've saved her if
I had arrived a little earlier.

969
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:48,381
"Don't leave me, my sweetheart."

970
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:57,379
"I beg you."

971
01:08:01,567 --> 01:08:10,146
"How am I going
to live without you?".

972
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:18,149
"The very thought
scares me to death."

973
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:24,305
"I can find God, if I want."

974
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:29,947
"But will I ever find you again."

975
01:08:31,067 --> 01:08:38,952
"I'll make you sit before me."

976
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:48,309
"And express my feelings."

977
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:00,472
The nurse from the hospital's here.

978
01:09:02,134 --> 01:09:04,273
Sister-in-law left a note for you.

979
01:09:06,467 --> 01:09:07,309
Here.

980
01:09:11,667 --> 01:09:12,839
Actually, sir.

981
01:09:13,534 --> 01:09:15,878
I couldn't muster the courage...

982
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,281
...to tell you anything
for the fear of losing my job.

983
01:09:20,133 --> 01:09:21,305
But suddenly, while cleaning up...

984
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:26,282
...I found this letter,
and I couldn't stop myself.

985
01:09:26,334 --> 01:09:29,907
Back in the hospital,
when Bhudev's men...

986
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,506
...came to meet you,
your wife saw everything.

987
01:09:34,067 --> 01:09:36,274
Sultan. - Yes, sir.

988
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:39,480
Give him a tight
slap on his cheeks.

989
01:09:40,234 --> 01:09:43,010
I must carry out
the master's orders.

990
01:09:43,067 --> 01:09:44,307
She was in pain.

991
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:45,277
Relax!

992
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:48,079
I left her alone and
dashed to get the injection.

993
01:09:49,267 --> 01:09:50,905
That was my only mistake.

994
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:53,044
Slap me.

995
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,211
She couldn't see
you getting humiliated.

996
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:03,615
And maybe, she took
this decision in a impulse.

997
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,909
'I know you can
do anything for me.'

998
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:23,616
'But I can't see you getting
humiliated because of me.'

999
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,539
"I'd rather die."

1000
01:10:30,067 --> 01:10:32,911
"I will be alive even after I die."

1001
01:10:34,301 --> 01:10:36,178
"But if you lose your respect..."

1002
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,110
"No n

1003
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:43,080
'Because I like to see
your head held high with pride.'

1004
01:10:51,267 --> 01:10:52,143
'Don't do it.'

1005
01:10:53,234 --> 01:10:54,212
'Don't do it.'

1006
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:55,611
'Don't do it.'

1007
01:11:51,534 --> 01:11:57,485
"My sweetheart..."

1008
01:11:57,534 --> 01:12:02,745
"ls my God."

1009
01:12:35,767 --> 01:12:37,371
Hail

1010
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,441
Why is he charging
in like a madman?

1011
01:12:47,467 --> 01:12:49,469
The CM's coming.

1012
01:12:49,801 --> 01:12:51,337
So, he's hereto lick his boots.

1013
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,807
Hail

1014
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:14,038
Hail

1015
01:14:14,767 --> 01:14:17,179
Bhudev!

1016
01:14:21,234 --> 01:14:23,339
Bhudev!

1017
01:14:26,267 --> 01:14:28,304
Bhudevl - Move. Move.

1018
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,040
Collector. Stop this nonsense.

1019
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,306
You're making a scene...

1020
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:33,677
"because Bhudev didn't
pay you the bribe of 10cr.

1021
01:15:10,234 --> 01:15:11,611
The political and Mafia nexus...

1022
01:15:11,934 --> 01:15:13,277
...charged me with
several accusations.

1023
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,404
I was sentenced to 16 years of jail.

1024
01:15:23,634 --> 01:15:27,446
There was just one
ray of hope in my life.

1025
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,071
Guddi.

1026
01:15:33,201 --> 01:15:35,203
I sent her far away.

1027
01:15:36,167 --> 01:15:41,207
I didn't want Bhudev to
take advantage of my any weakness.

1028
01:15:43,201 --> 01:15:45,977
There was just one
motive of my life.

1029
01:15:46,401 --> 01:15:47,106
Revenge!

1030
01:15:47,567 --> 01:15:48,204
Revenge!

1031
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,405
Revenge!

1032
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:53,841
Each day...my rage would grow.

1033
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:56,947
My anger would evoke.

1034
01:15:57,434 --> 01:16:00,074
And the jails would grow shorter.

1035
01:16:02,234 --> 01:16:03,338
And one day...

1036
01:16:21,334 --> 01:16:22,779
That rascal Gullu.

1037
01:16:23,367 --> 01:16:27,042
Remember, one day he brought...

1038
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,443
...cockroaches in
his lunch-box in school.

1039
01:16:29,101 --> 01:16:30,944
Remember, how Mrs. Breganza yelled.

1040
01:16:32,867 --> 01:16:35,006
One of those cockroaches
got into her clothes.

1041
01:16:38,534 --> 01:16:41,014
And that...college high-jumping.

1042
01:16:43,634 --> 01:16:46,342
Scaling the high-walls.

1043
01:16:46,867 --> 01:16:48,869
Pappu's country bar.

1044
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,171
First time you tasted this...

1045
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,945
...you guzzled the entire bottle.

1046
01:16:57,134 --> 01:16:59,171
You were drunk, just like now.

1047
01:17:01,267 --> 01:17:04,214
Yet, there was
goodness in your eyes.

1048
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,838
There's a lot of pain in the world.

1049
01:17:10,534 --> 01:17:13,174
But few who are willing to share it.

1050
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,946
I still remember this.

1051
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:23,441
Even during recession,
you studied so hard...

1052
01:17:23,501 --> 01:17:25,344
...and surpassed everyone.

1053
01:17:25,767 --> 01:17:26,905
You became a Collector.

1054
01:17:27,567 --> 01:17:28,511
So that one day...

1055
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:30,336
...you could be the
one to share their pain.

1056
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,979
What's wrong now?

1057
01:17:37,567 --> 01:17:40,013
You forgot the motive of your life.
- Mr. Jailor.

1058
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,902
You're a friend,
so prove that you are.

1059
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,077
Show me a way to get out of here.

1060
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:46,278
What good is that?

1061
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:48,408
You will kill Bhudev.

1062
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:49,445
And then be hanged for it.

1063
01:17:49,501 --> 01:17:51,503
I've already been hanged.

1064
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:57,074
But, I'll gel salvation
only after I kill him

1065
01:17:59,934 --> 01:18:01,072
And what about those five?

1066
01:18:02,534 --> 01:18:03,444
Your accomplices.

1067
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:04,941
What about them?

1068
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,440
They were sentenced to prison...

1069
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,377
"because they shared your pain.

1070
01:18:10,734 --> 01:18:12,236
Will they be pardoned?

1071
01:18:14,867 --> 01:18:16,676
You're indebted to them.

1072
01:18:17,834 --> 01:18:19,438
And you've to repay it.

1073
01:18:47,834 --> 01:18:49,074
This is what sister-in-law
wanted as well.

1074
01:18:50,834 --> 01:18:53,110
To see your head
held high with pride.

1075
01:18:55,967 --> 01:18:58,208
I found her letter
amongst your stuff.

1076
01:19:00,967 --> 01:19:01,707
Read it. Again.

1077
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:21,913
'I know you can do anything for me.'

1078
01:19:23,234 --> 01:19:25,236
'But if you lose your respect...'

1079
01:19:26,267 --> 01:19:27,041
'No.'

1080
01:19:28,867 --> 01:19:32,110
'Because I like to see
your head held high with pride.'

1081
01:19:34,334 --> 01:19:37,907
'One has to pay a big
price to gain respect.'

1082
01:19:38,367 --> 01:19:40,108
You need to change,
you need to forget.

1083
01:19:41,301 --> 01:19:42,371
Even if its revenge.

1084
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:48,111
Not revenge, but change.

1085
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:50,311
Change.

1086
01:20:01,434 --> 01:20:04,142
My friend Mohammad
Iqbal kept his promise.

1087
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:06,808
And recommended my
name to the Governor.

1088
01:20:07,934 --> 01:20:10,312
The rest of my sentence was pardon...

1089
01:20:10,867 --> 01:20:12,869
...due to good conduct.

1090
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:15,971
Now, I had to keep my promise.

1091
01:20:16,867 --> 01:20:18,642
I have to repay few debts.

1092
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,977
That's why I didn't let
my release be publicized.

1093
01:20:22,834 --> 01:20:23,904
I changed my garb.

1094
01:20:23,967 --> 01:20:25,310
With a new name and identity...

1095
01:20:26,034 --> 01:20:27,877
...started walking
on the path of change.

1096
01:20:28,634 --> 01:20:31,774
Because I didn't want
my only enmity to obstruct me.

1097
01:20:32,101 --> 01:20:36,277
I want to end the
terror of all Bhudevs.

1098
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:39,303
So that,
while treading on the path...

1099
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:41,574
...of change,
when I go to the next world.

1100
01:20:42,367 --> 01:20:44,745
Where Miinnie's waiting for me,
my head's...

1101
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:51,548
...still held high with pride.

1102
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,977
"It's too dark,
the dawn should arise.'

1103
01:20:57,701 --> 01:21:01,581
"The ambience should
change in any way possible."

1104
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:10,115
Sir. On this path of change...

1105
01:21:11,301 --> 01:21:12,939
...on behalf of the media,
we're with you.

1106
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:21,512
Girl. I don't wish to exaggerate.

1107
01:21:22,067 --> 01:21:23,842
But, the world will soon see...

1108
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,973
...what this Sikh's going to do.

1109
01:21:27,034 --> 01:21:29,810
"Singh Saab the Great."

1110
01:21:30,101 --> 01:21:36,052
"Singh Saab the Great."

1111
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:38,508
Bhudev isn't here.

1112
01:21:38,867 --> 01:21:41,177
Remember the surgery
he got done for his cheek.

1113
01:21:41,234 --> 01:21:43,180
He's gone to sweeterland
for that again... - Sir.

1114
01:21:43,234 --> 01:21:44,770
It's Switzerland.

1115
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:45,804
What?

1116
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:48,804
I do everything by the book.

1117
01:21:49,267 --> 01:21:51,008
I only sell 30 trucks
of sand every day...

1118
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:53,911
...which is the limit.
- Sir, total 3489...

1119
01:21:53,967 --> 01:21:54,843
Why you...

1120
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,871
Sir, doing my job sir.

1121
01:22:00,967 --> 01:22:03,106
"Why are you feeling coy?"

1122
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:05,239
"There's something
that you're hiding."

1123
01:22:05,301 --> 01:22:08,475
Wonderful.

1124
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:11,770
Govardhan.

1125
01:22:11,834 --> 01:22:12,812
Hello. - Hello.

1126
01:22:12,867 --> 01:22:14,107
Having a meeting?

1127
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:15,703
It's just...

1128
01:22:15,767 --> 01:22:17,007
Tea and snacks! - Yes.

1129
01:22:17,067 --> 01:22:17,977
Have some...

1130
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,511
Why didn't you go to the station?

1131
01:22:20,567 --> 01:22:21,841
I already inquired.

1132
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:22,811
The train's 3 hours delayed.

1133
01:22:22,867 --> 01:22:25,575
What delay? - Yes, 3 hours delayed.

1134
01:22:25,634 --> 01:22:28,080
I don't care how delayed,
remain at the station.

1135
01:22:28,134 --> 01:22:29,977
Brother. Don't worry.

1136
01:22:30,034 --> 01:22:31,604
Just give me a free hand.

1137
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:37,743
I'll leach him a lesson
he'll never forget.

1138
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:41,145
You imbecile...
- Don't abuse me publicly.

1139
01:22:41,801 --> 01:22:45,840
I know that Singh
has a huge vote-bank.

1140
01:23:06,834 --> 01:23:07,744
'Jai Hind, sir.'

1141
01:23:07,801 --> 01:23:08,871
lam Bhawar singh.

1142
01:23:08,934 --> 01:23:10,379
'Welcome, sir.'

1143
01:23:11,467 --> 01:23:13,003
'Your secretary, Mr. Tyagi.'

1144
01:23:13,067 --> 01:23:13,841
Hello.

1145
01:23:14,734 --> 01:23:15,109
'Allow me.'

1146
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:15,907
Thank you.

1147
01:23:16,434 --> 01:23:18,573
'Sir, everyone's waiting for you.'

1148
01:23:18,634 --> 01:23:21,114
'Minnie. Where's my mobile?'

1149
01:23:21,434 --> 01:23:22,708
'Why don't you remember?'

1150
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:27,741
'Mobile? - Here you go.'

1151
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,601
'Thank you.'

1152
01:23:30,734 --> 01:23:32,611
'Learn to look after your things.'

1153
01:23:32,867 --> 01:23:34,642
'You forgot your phone on the seat.'

1154
01:23:34,701 --> 01:23:36,908
'I don't have to worry
when you're there.'

1155
01:23:38,567 --> 01:23:42,037
'What if I'm not there?
- Where can you go?'

1156
01:23:43,434 --> 01:23:44,640
'Where can you go?'

1157
01:23:46,401 --> 01:23:47,379
You did us a big a favor...

1158
01:23:47,434 --> 01:23:48,845
...but accepting our invitation.

1159
01:23:49,134 --> 01:23:51,410
I just had to come here.

1160
01:23:51,967 --> 01:23:53,344
Sooner or later...

1161
01:23:53,634 --> 01:23:54,339
What?

1162
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,378
He had to clean-up the place.

1163
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:56,804
Clean? - Mr. Chopra.

1164
01:23:57,101 --> 01:23:58,045
Gowardhan?

1165
01:24:00,834 --> 01:24:02,074
Stop!

1166
01:24:02,534 --> 01:24:03,535
What is this?

1167
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,740
Welcome, Singh sir.

1168
01:24:06,534 --> 01:24:08,810
We're delighted that
you came to Bhadori.

1169
01:24:14,334 --> 01:24:16,371
And as far as this grand
reception is concerned...

1170
01:24:16,434 --> 01:24:18,414
...it's on behalf of Gowardhan.

1171
01:24:18,467 --> 01:24:18,808
Come.

1172
01:24:18,867 --> 01:24:21,541
We've arranged your stay
at a five-star hotel, Daata.

1173
01:24:21,601 --> 01:24:22,671
Daata?

1174
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,412
It's been two months
since you didn't pay up.

1175
01:24:25,467 --> 01:24:26,775
I suffered a loss of 300,000.

1176
01:24:26,834 --> 01:24:28,575
Stop him. Has he lost his mind?

1177
01:24:28,634 --> 01:24:30,409
Someone please explain him.

1178
01:24:30,467 --> 01:24:31,639
What Daata transport?

1179
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:32,701
Hold on? - What?

1180
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:34,678
He doesn't work for Daata transport.

1181
01:24:34,734 --> 01:24:36,509
What are you saying?
- They're descent people.

1182
01:24:36,567 --> 01:24:38,979
And you're whacking him?

1183
01:24:39,034 --> 01:24:40,672
Sorry. - What sorry?

1184
01:24:40,734 --> 01:24:42,645
Go request Singh sir.

1185
01:24:42,701 --> 01:24:43,702
Quickly. - Yes.

1186
01:24:44,634 --> 01:24:45,635
Singh Sir.

1187
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:47,612
You can't stay with
these small people.

1188
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:49,544
Come with me to
Bhudev Singh's place.

1189
01:24:51,867 --> 01:24:54,677
Bhudev Singh's is
a magnanimous person.

1190
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,704
"Bhudev Singh's is
a magnanimous person."

1191
01:24:58,767 --> 01:24:59,677
Yes.

1192
01:25:00,067 --> 01:25:01,512
Have you heard this saying?

1193
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:07,715
The higher the weigh-scale,
the lighter it gets.

1194
01:25:08,667 --> 01:25:09,975
And as far as small...

1195
01:25:10,734 --> 01:25:12,577
Small snowflakes.

1196
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:15,046
Those small, minute ones.

1197
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:18,445
Together, they form the Himalayas.

1198
01:25:18,834 --> 01:25:21,007
So don't ever consider anyone small.

1199
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,345
Let's go, Mr. Tripathi.

1200
01:25:27,301 --> 01:25:28,609
Govardhan. - Yes.

1201
01:25:28,667 --> 01:25:29,975
Come here. - Yes.

1202
01:25:30,734 --> 01:25:33,010
Has Bhudev Singh sprinkled perfume...

1203
01:25:33,301 --> 01:25:34,871
...in the air to welcome us?

1204
01:25:35,367 --> 01:25:36,038
What?

1205
01:25:36,367 --> 01:25:37,573
He means perfume.

1206
01:25:37,934 --> 01:25:40,437
Don't you understand, Govardhan?

1207
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,706
He's talking about the toilet...

1208
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:42,939
...which is smelling so rotten.

1209
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,946
It's the Railway's job to clean up.

1210
01:25:45,001 --> 01:25:46,981
Railway? - That's your problem.

1211
01:25:47,034 --> 01:25:48,911
You blame the government
for everything.

1212
01:25:48,967 --> 01:25:50,537
You should do few things yourself.

1213
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,743
This is Bhudev Singh's city.

1214
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,505
Come on.

1215
01:25:53,767 --> 01:25:54,541
Give me the broom.

1216
01:25:54,601 --> 01:25:56,012
I'll do it. - Singh sir.

1217
01:25:56,301 --> 01:25:57,541
Singh sir... - I'll do it.

1218
01:25:57,601 --> 01:25:58,602
You're humiliating us.

1219
01:25:58,667 --> 01:25:59,645
I am there.

1220
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,373
Here. Go clean up.

1221
01:26:01,434 --> 01:26:03,778
First time someone's
doing the right job.

1222
01:26:03,834 --> 01:26:06,576
Play the music.

1223
01:26:10,334 --> 01:26:12,245
Stop this recording.

1224
01:26:14,534 --> 01:26:16,707
Play the music. Let's dance.

1225
01:26:16,767 --> 01:26:18,872
The People's Beat team have arrived.

1226
01:26:18,934 --> 01:26:20,277
And Singh Saab has already...

1227
01:26:20,334 --> 01:26:22,405
...begun his campaign
of bringing a change.

1228
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:29,245
Very nice.

1229
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,240
We hope that Singh Saab will soon...

1230
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:37,908
...eradicate corruption
and terror from Bhadori.

1231
01:26:37,967 --> 01:26:40,675
With cameraman Deepak,
this is Shika Chaturvedi.

1232
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:50,776
Nola penny less than two million.
Please leave.

1233
01:26:50,834 --> 01:26:52,745
Sir, I've withdrawn my entire PF.

1234
01:26:53,267 --> 01:26:54,803
I've taken a loan
and borrowed money...

1235
01:26:54,867 --> 01:26:55,937
...from my friends
to gather 1.2 million.

1236
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,502
When it's beyond your stature...

1237
01:26:57,567 --> 01:26:58,602
...then why do you
bother coming here?

1238
01:26:58,667 --> 01:26:59,975
Please leave.

1239
01:27:00,034 --> 01:27:02,446
But, sir. I always heard, that...

1240
01:27:02,501 --> 01:27:05,505
...one needs marks and
not stature for admission.

1241
01:27:12,934 --> 01:27:14,379
Ms. Radhika.

1242
01:27:14,967 --> 01:27:17,641
Bhudev sir's got 11 colleges.

1243
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:18,906
And I am the trustee.

1244
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:21,412
And I know this better
than anyone else.

1245
01:27:22,334 --> 01:27:25,645
I always explain the parents.

1246
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:27,772
Rather than pressurizing
the children to get 90%.â€œ

1247
01:27:27,834 --> 01:27:30,337
...if you had used that
effort to amass money...

1248
01:27:30,734 --> 01:27:31,872
...it would've been
best for everyone.

1249
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,704
Anyway, that's okay.

1250
01:27:38,267 --> 01:27:40,406
Let's do something for you.

1251
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,208
Mr. Dixit.
Your daughter's really talented.

1252
01:27:46,967 --> 01:27:48,173
Beautiful too.

1253
01:27:48,734 --> 01:27:50,611
Father. I don't want admission.

1254
01:27:50,667 --> 01:27:51,372
Radhika.

1255
01:27:51,867 --> 01:27:54,609
You're a cheap man, Mr. Srivastav.

1256
01:27:55,334 --> 01:27:59,714
Srivastavl
You cannot escape me today.

1257
01:27:59,767 --> 01:28:02,270
You took Rs.150,000 as donation...

1258
01:28:02,334 --> 01:28:04,371
...for the admission
of my son in your school.

1259
01:28:04,434 --> 01:28:06,175
Rs.150,000. - Sir.

1260
01:28:06,234 --> 01:28:08,407
You're corrupt.
You were born in filth.

1261
01:28:08,767 --> 01:28:11,304
You don't eat but gobble money.

1262
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:12,708
Stop.

1263
01:28:13,134 --> 01:28:14,442
He's Ravindra Srivastav.

1264
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,810
And the one who swindled
your money is Surender Srivastav.

1265
01:28:17,101 --> 01:28:17,602
What are you doing?

1266
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:18,577
Sir, he made a mistake.

1267
01:28:18,634 --> 01:28:19,442
You can hit me.

1268
01:28:19,501 --> 01:28:20,639
No, I will kill you.

1269
01:28:21,134 --> 01:28:22,704
Sorry... - What sorry.

1270
01:28:22,767 --> 01:28:23,507
Who are you two?

1271
01:28:28,901 --> 01:28:30,107
'Mango People.'

1272
01:28:30,634 --> 01:28:31,738
'Aam Aadmi' (Common Man).

1273
01:28:32,467 --> 01:28:35,641
You do know,
mangoes taste a bit sweet and sour.

1274
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,578
And 'Peepal'(Banyan).

1275
01:28:38,901 --> 01:28:41,074
They're always infested by ghosts.

1276
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,710
The common man is
also infested by ghosts.

1277
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:45,477
Don't try to provoke them.

1278
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:48,076
Give them admission
without donation.

1279
01:28:48,534 --> 01:28:51,208
So, you are Singh Saab.

1280
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,705
You're posing as a messiah.

1281
01:28:54,167 --> 01:28:56,579
You've been opening offices
of People's beat in every city.

1282
01:28:57,167 --> 01:29:01,445
But you made a big mistake...

1283
01:29:01,901 --> 01:29:03,778
mrejecting Lallan's invitation.

1284
01:29:04,334 --> 01:29:05,540
Now, no one's getting any admission.

1285
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,170
Get out. No admission...

1286
01:29:07,234 --> 01:29:08,577
Sir, no admission
without permission...

1287
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:11,205
I said no...
How did this camera get in?

1288
01:29:11,267 --> 01:29:13,110
What's going on?
- There will be cameras everywhere.

1289
01:29:13,734 --> 01:29:15,270
Everything will be transparent.

1290
01:29:15,567 --> 01:29:16,671
Transparency.

1291
01:29:17,067 --> 01:29:19,775
This is vandalism... - No.

1292
01:29:20,234 --> 01:29:21,474
This is trouble.

1293
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,670
The goons are in trouble.

1294
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:24,769
Do you know what that means?

1295
01:29:24,834 --> 01:29:26,074
Bad times.

1296
01:29:26,134 --> 01:29:27,579
I think he didn't understand.

1297
01:29:27,634 --> 01:29:28,669
Explain to him.

1298
01:29:28,734 --> 01:29:31,738
This program is sponsored
by Mango Student.

1299
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:32,506
Take a look.

1300
01:29:37,234 --> 01:29:40,010
And these students
are here for their rights.

1301
01:29:40,301 --> 01:29:41,302
Although they have merits...

1302
01:29:41,367 --> 01:29:42,710
...they didn't get admission.

1303
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:46,074
And Bhudev Singh
was really sad for them.

1304
01:29:47,734 --> 01:29:51,477
Well, let's cure his pain today.

1305
01:29:57,034 --> 01:29:58,377
Well, Mr. Srivastav.

1306
01:29:58,834 --> 01:30:01,144
Will they get admission
without donation now?

1307
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,678
How much donation
do we have to pay, sir?

1308
01:30:10,667 --> 01:30:13,170
You all clap very well.

1309
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,540
You could've got this
opportunity before...

1310
01:30:18,101 --> 01:30:22,277
...if all of you had approached
the College committee...

1311
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:23,506
...and tried explaining them.

1312
01:30:23,567 --> 01:30:25,137
And you could've clapped again...

1313
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,975
...if they did not listen.

1314
01:30:27,767 --> 01:30:29,337
But, at that time...

1315
01:30:29,734 --> 01:30:32,214
...the faces of the
Committee members...

1316
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,106
...would've been between your palms.

1317
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,276
And you could've
clapped all you wanted.

1318
01:30:46,701 --> 01:30:48,578
You are students.

1319
01:30:49,034 --> 01:30:51,207
I want to tell you one thing.

1320
01:30:52,534 --> 01:30:54,138
The world isn't a bad place...

1321
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,407
"because bad people are power.

1322
01:30:57,134 --> 01:30:59,671
In fact, it's because good people...

1323
01:30:59,734 --> 01:31:03,477
...don't unite together
and use their strength.

1324
01:31:03,534 --> 01:31:05,138
Vivekanand has said.

1325
01:31:05,434 --> 01:31:08,972
"Rise. Awaken. Be strong."

1326
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,244
"Because it's the goat's
that always sacrificed..."

1327
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:14,008
"...not the lion."

1328
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,911
Bethe lion.

1329
01:31:17,434 --> 01:31:20,847
Glory to. Singh Saab!

1330
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:36,109
"He's full of love."

1331
01:31:36,167 --> 01:31:38,647
"Wishes well for everyone."

1332
01:31:39,067 --> 01:31:45,040
"Preaches love to everyone,
kin or stranger."

1333
01:31:45,101 --> 01:31:48,173
"Spreads love, heeds to love."

1334
01:31:48,234 --> 01:31:50,271
"He's the ultimate."

1335
01:31:50,334 --> 01:31:53,281
"Singh Saab the Great."

1336
01:31:53,334 --> 01:31:56,338
"Singh Saab the Great."

1337
01:31:56,401 --> 01:31:59,439
"Singh Saab the Great."

1338
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:03,573
"Singh Saab the Great."

1339
01:32:09,434 --> 01:32:15,180
"My beloved's so handsome."

1340
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:21,314
"Let me shower my love.

1341
01:32:21,367 --> 01:32:27,579
"I should ask your tears from God"

1342
01:32:27,967 --> 01:32:35,146
"My beloved's so handsome."

1343
01:32:49,301 --> 01:32:55,343
"My beloved's so handsome."

1344
01:32:55,400 --> 01:33:01,373
"Let me shower my love.

1345
01:33:01,434 --> 01:33:05,849
"I should ask your tears from God"

1346
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,902
'Singh Saab's pain
was really severe.'

1347
01:33:08,267 --> 01:33:10,247
'I could feel it.'

1348
01:33:11,234 --> 01:33:15,182
'But he would forget
all about his pain...'

1349
01:33:15,234 --> 01:33:18,181
'...and coolly handle
the situations.'

1350
01:33:19,834 --> 01:33:22,508
'The wind of change was
already flowing through Bhadori.'

1351
01:33:23,534 --> 01:33:27,414
'We were only waiting
for Bhudev to arrive.'

1352
01:33:35,034 --> 01:33:37,071
Singh Saab,
a huge momentum is building up.

1353
01:33:37,134 --> 01:33:39,205
There has been huge number of hits...

1354
01:33:39,267 --> 01:33:40,905
...on Bhudev Hate Pages
on Facebook and Twitter.

1355
01:33:40,967 --> 01:33:42,378
That's okay, but what good is that?

1356
01:33:42,967 --> 01:33:44,002
Someone rightly said...

1357
01:33:44,467 --> 01:33:46,344
You can't take small
steps to do something big.

1358
01:33:46,901 --> 01:33:49,814
One needs to step out of
the lanes to get on the road.

1359
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:53,147
Then let's arrange for
a huge candle-light procession.

1360
01:33:54,067 --> 01:33:56,513
The feeling dies
along with the flame.

1361
01:33:56,801 --> 01:33:58,212
That's what normally happens.

1362
01:33:58,267 --> 01:33:59,837
We should change our ways.

1363
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:00,901
Then, what do we do?

1364
01:34:00,967 --> 01:34:02,105
How do we take revenge?

1365
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:03,111
Yes, Singh Saab.

1366
01:34:03,167 --> 01:34:04,976
We'll have to change the rules.

1367
01:34:05,234 --> 01:34:06,770
To bring a change in this place...

1368
01:34:06,834 --> 01:34:08,279
...we'll have to change Bhudev Singh.

1369
01:34:18,034 --> 01:34:19,012
Rohan.

1370
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:19,174
Hold the umbrella.
Give me the camera.

1371
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,411
Switch off the camera.

1372
01:35:26,467 --> 01:35:29,243
Wretch! Trying to show
people the naked truth!

1373
01:35:29,301 --> 01:35:31,406
I'll show you how
it feels to be naked.

1374
01:35:31,767 --> 01:35:32,404
Move.

1375
01:36:35,334 --> 01:36:37,974
Thank God you stopped your people.

1376
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,080
If I had wielded this around...

1377
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,837
<i>...it</i> would've started another war!

1378
01:36:48,101 --> 01:36:51,310
Singh Saab, I don't even
need to make that effort.

1379
01:36:51,367 --> 01:36:52,903
My eyes are all I need.

1380
01:36:54,367 --> 01:36:55,675
When I wield them around...

1381
01:36:55,734 --> 01:36:57,372
...it makes the world spin around.

1382
01:36:57,434 --> 01:37:00,108
War or no war!

1383
01:37:01,634 --> 01:37:03,614
May God never vest
anyone with so much power...

1384
01:37:04,101 --> 01:37:06,308
...that he ignores everyone else.

1385
01:37:09,234 --> 01:37:12,010
Bhudev Singh.
Forget about your might.

1386
01:37:12,801 --> 01:37:15,247
Times have changed,
so change yourself.

1387
01:37:18,034 --> 01:37:20,605
Those who bow are
the ones who are alive.

1388
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:24,147
Only the dead remain stiff.

1389
01:37:28,067 --> 01:37:29,307
You are right.

1390
01:37:30,134 --> 01:37:32,740
One has to bow to stay alive.

1391
01:37:33,034 --> 01:37:35,036
I always bow before the people.

1392
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,636
Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!

1393
01:37:36,701 --> 01:37:38,772
And greetings to you too.

1394
01:37:41,034 --> 01:37:43,913
I've organized a
party to welcome you.

1395
01:37:44,834 --> 01:37:45,642
Private.

1396
01:37:46,767 --> 01:37:50,146
Ex-Collector Saranjeet Talwar sir.

1397
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:55,574
Aka Sunny.

1398
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:15,239
Welcome. Welcome, Singh Saab.

1399
01:38:15,534 --> 01:38:17,673
You look in a good mood.

1400
01:38:18,134 --> 01:38:20,580
Are you going to make a scene here?

1401
01:38:23,801 --> 01:38:26,111
Now that you've recognized...

1402
01:38:26,867 --> 01:38:33,113
max-collector Saranjeet Talwar,
aka Sunny...

1403
01:38:33,767 --> 01:38:37,214
...then...there's definitely
going to be something.

1404
01:38:47,634 --> 01:38:50,672
"You've offered
liquor to your enemy."

1405
01:38:51,934 --> 01:38:56,041
"Now watch how he breathes fire."

1406
01:38:56,967 --> 01:38:57,911
So...

1407
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:03,114
Let's provoke that fire with fire.

1408
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,876
Dance.

1409
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:37,170
"What lime did you use?"

1410
01:39:38,934 --> 01:39:42,507
"Which catechu did you use?"

1411
01:39:50,601 --> 01:39:54,481
"What lime did you use?"
"Which catechu did you use?"

1412
01:39:54,534 --> 01:39:58,107
"if I find the betel-leaf maker,
I'll abuse him."

1413
01:39:58,167 --> 01:40:01,910
"I'll burn down his shop."

1414
01:40:01,967 --> 01:40:03,708
"That dreaded..."

1415
01:40:03,767 --> 01:40:05,474
"That dreaded..."

1416
01:40:05,734 --> 01:40:09,648
"That dreaded betel leaf,
almost killed me."

1417
01:40:09,701 --> 01:40:13,444
"That dreaded betel leaf,
almost killed me."

1418
01:40:13,501 --> 01:40:16,846
"I lost..."

1419
01:40:17,434 --> 01:40:21,007
"I lost...now move away."

1420
01:40:21,067 --> 01:40:25,641
"That dreaded betel leaf,
almost killed me."

1421
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:44,678
"With a kerchief
tied around your neck."

1422
01:40:44,734 --> 01:40:48,546
"You'd come every
day with those red lips."

1423
01:40:52,434 --> 01:40:55,711
"With a kerchief
tied around your neck."

1424
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:59,570
"Comes every day
with those red lips."

1425
01:40:59,634 --> 01:41:03,377
"Doesn't understand..."

1426
01:41:03,434 --> 01:41:07,041
"Doesn't understand
the condition of my heart."

1427
01:41:07,334 --> 01:41:11,749
"That dreaded betel leaf,
almost killed me."

1428
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,311
"What a chord you've struck."

1429
01:41:30,734 --> 01:41:34,511
"My heart's beating
violently again."

1430
01:41:34,567 --> 01:41:37,912
"I want to burn down
this sinful abode."

1431
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:42,040
"Come on. Come on."

1432
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:45,980
"Let me clear your doubts."

1433
01:41:46,034 --> 01:41:49,504
"Your wishes will never come true."

1434
01:41:49,567 --> 01:41:51,478
"I'm right, you're wrong."

1435
01:41:51,534 --> 01:41:53,411
"I'm right, you're wrong."

1436
01:41:53,467 --> 01:41:55,777
"What's this song?"

1437
01:41:57,034 --> 01:42:00,504
"Let-s forget..."

1438
01:42:00,867 --> 01:42:04,679
"Let's forget,
beloved don't be so tensed."

1439
01:42:04,734 --> 01:42:08,477
"That dreaded betel leaf,
almost killed me."

1440
01:42:08,534 --> 01:42:12,414
"What lime did you use?"
"Which catechu did you use?"

1441
01:42:12,467 --> 01:42:16,279
"if I find the betel-leaf maker,
I'll abuse him."

1442
01:42:16,334 --> 01:42:19,941
"I'll burn down his shop."

1443
01:42:20,234 --> 01:42:21,178
"That dreaded..."

1444
01:42:21,867 --> 01:42:22,971
"That dreaded..."

1445
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:27,714
"Eat that dreaded betel leaf,
kill me loo."

1446
01:42:27,767 --> 01:42:31,909
"Eat that dreaded betel leaf,
kill me loo."

1447
01:42:42,001 --> 01:42:44,481
Wonderful!

1448
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:46,571
Wonderful!

1449
01:42:46,634 --> 01:42:50,309
How about a little chamcha...

1450
01:42:51,401 --> 01:42:52,436
Chat!

1451
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:53,774
How about it?

1452
01:42:54,334 --> 01:42:54,835
Come on.

1453
01:42:55,367 --> 01:42:56,345
Chat.

1454
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,778
Let's reveal all the cards?

1455
01:43:02,601 --> 01:43:04,239
All cards will be revealed now.

1456
01:43:05,967 --> 01:43:07,844
Then do it.

1457
01:43:09,367 --> 01:43:11,278
Take your revenge.

1458
01:43:14,267 --> 01:43:16,338
If I really wanted revenge, Bhudev...

1459
01:43:16,934 --> 01:43:20,381
...then, you wouldn't
be standing here.

1460
01:43:24,767 --> 01:43:30,376
So, how many bones did
you break to find my truth?

1461
01:43:31,901 --> 01:43:32,811
Forget it.

1462
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:35,902
Tell me what you want?

1463
01:43:37,934 --> 01:43:39,880
You're now a politician.

1464
01:43:40,867 --> 01:43:43,279
But, you lack the
knowledge of a politician.

1465
01:43:44,634 --> 01:43:48,514
Politics is the university of crime.

1466
01:43:49,567 --> 01:43:54,277
Here, Might is right!

1467
01:43:55,934 --> 01:43:59,438
I know, just like
diamond cuts diamond...

1468
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:02,174
...similarly, you're here
to teach a lesson to politicians.

1469
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,643
Forget about enmity.

1470
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:09,209
Now that you've gained
such popularity...

1471
01:44:09,267 --> 01:44:13,647
...with your false shams,
so let's together...

1472
01:44:13,701 --> 01:44:15,374
...take advantage of it.

1473
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:22,579
In the coming elections,
you promote my party.

1474
01:44:24,901 --> 01:44:29,145
You want me to be
the brand ambassador...

1475
01:44:29,534 --> 01:44:31,639
...of your conniving party.

1476
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:36,076
Just because you've
a convoy following you...

1477
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,477
...you think you're the king.

1478
01:44:38,901 --> 01:44:42,075
What's your stature?

1479
01:44:43,567 --> 01:44:46,275
You're a thief. A rascal.

1480
01:44:47,167 --> 01:44:48,805
Scoundrel.

1481
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:51,174
A pimp.

1482
01:44:51,734 --> 01:44:52,804
A political pimp.

1483
01:44:52,867 --> 01:44:53,572
Done?

1484
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:56,811
I've many more titles.

1485
01:44:57,801 --> 01:45:03,080
I'm a thief,
a thug, scoundrel, cheat.

1486
01:45:03,834 --> 01:45:05,211
So, who isn't?

1487
01:45:05,734 --> 01:45:08,715
Minister. Leader. MP. MLA.

1488
01:45:08,767 --> 01:45:11,611
Officer.
Clerk. They are all thieves.

1489
01:45:12,367 --> 01:45:14,608
They are all full of corruption.

1490
01:45:14,667 --> 01:45:17,147
And you blame me alone for it.

1491
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:22,103
I am the sand-mafia. Yes, I am.

1492
01:45:23,267 --> 01:45:26,305
I buy and sell MLAs and MPs.
Yes, I do.

1493
01:45:26,867 --> 01:45:29,609
I give protection to goons.
Yes, I do.

1494
01:45:29,667 --> 01:45:30,441
So what?

1495
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:34,237
I am the murderer of your wife.
Yes, I am.

1496
01:45:34,301 --> 01:45:35,746
So what?

1497
01:45:38,334 --> 01:45:42,646
I am the law...and the lawmaker.

1498
01:45:43,701 --> 01:45:46,648
I've wealth and power.

1499
01:45:49,134 --> 01:45:51,444
One that commands money and power...

1500
01:45:52,767 --> 01:45:54,713
The society...

1501
01:45:54,767 --> 01:45:56,804
...and the law...

1502
01:45:56,867 --> 01:46:00,576
...dances to his tune.

1503
01:46:02,901 --> 01:46:05,006
Now take my advice.

1504
01:46:07,834 --> 01:46:08,744
Or else?

1505
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:10,678
Rati.

1506
01:46:10,734 --> 01:46:11,337
Yes.

1507
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:13,770
Play the CD we just made.

1508
01:46:13,834 --> 01:46:17,748
"What lime did you use?
Which catechu did you use?"

1509
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:21,612
"if I find the betel-leaf maker,
I'll abuse him."

1510
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:25,410
"I'll burn down his shop."

1511
01:46:25,467 --> 01:46:27,276
"That dreaded..."

1512
01:46:27,334 --> 01:46:29,075
"That dreaded..."

1513
01:46:29,134 --> 01:46:33,241
"Eat that dreaded betel leaf,
kill me loo."

1514
01:46:33,301 --> 01:46:37,681
"Eat that dreaded betel leaf,
kill me loo."

1515
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:44,743
My name's Bhudev.

1516
01:46:45,667 --> 01:46:47,203
The Lord of ghosts.

1517
01:46:48,567 --> 01:46:51,173
If this CD plays on television...

1518
01:46:51,834 --> 01:46:54,474
...the people will maul you.

1519
01:46:55,534 --> 01:46:58,572
"Mango people?"

1520
01:46:58,634 --> 01:47:00,113
Right, Srivastav.

1521
01:47:03,601 --> 01:47:06,013
Fine. Play it.

1522
01:47:09,201 --> 01:47:11,704
I am not a politician
hungry for votes.

1523
01:47:12,767 --> 01:47:16,044
Let my character
be ruined in public.

1524
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,637
But it's important for
your character to get better.

1525
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:23,681
Once you change,
everyone will change.

1526
01:47:23,734 --> 01:47:25,111
Right.

1527
01:47:25,167 --> 01:47:29,115
We've already made
all the connections.

1528
01:47:29,734 --> 01:47:31,008
Show him.

1529
01:47:32,201 --> 01:47:33,680
Bhudev Singh exposed.

1530
01:47:33,734 --> 01:47:35,111
Breaking news.

1531
01:47:35,167 --> 01:47:40,082
Singh Saab carried
out a sting operation.

1532
01:47:40,767 --> 01:47:44,681
And through this, he exposed...

1533
01:47:44,734 --> 01:47:50,013
...Bhadori's influential
Daata Bhudev Singh's evil deeds.

1534
01:47:50,067 --> 01:47:53,344
Let's watch an exclusive
footage of this exposition.

1535
01:47:53,401 --> 01:47:58,373
I'm a thief,
a thug, scoundrel, cheat.

1536
01:47:58,701 --> 01:47:59,702
So, who isn't?

1537
01:47:59,767 --> 01:48:03,146
Minister. Leader. MP. MLA.

1538
01:48:03,201 --> 01:48:05,272
Officer.
Clerk. They are all thieves.

1539
01:48:05,334 --> 01:48:07,575
They are all full of corruption.

1540
01:48:11,467 --> 01:48:13,947
I am the murderer of your wife.
Yes, I am.

1541
01:48:14,001 --> 01:48:15,275
So what?

1542
01:48:15,334 --> 01:48:17,041
I am the law...

1543
01:48:17,567 --> 01:48:18,978
What is this happening?

1544
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:19,944
Let's go.

1545
01:48:35,234 --> 01:48:38,044
Down with Bhudev!

1546
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:39,511
Down with Bhudev!

1547
01:48:39,567 --> 01:48:42,013
Down with Bhudev!

1548
01:48:42,067 --> 01:48:43,978
Down with Bhudev!

1549
01:48:44,034 --> 01:48:46,014
Down with Bhudev!

1550
01:48:46,068 --> 01:48:47,638
Down with Bhudev!

1551
01:48:47,934 --> 01:48:49,641
Down with Bhudev!

1552
01:48:49,701 --> 01:48:51,647
Down with Bhudev!

1553
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:53,577
Down with Bhudev!

1554
01:48:53,634 --> 01:48:55,341
Down with Bhudev!

1555
01:48:57,667 --> 01:48:59,613
You just made a CD.

1556
01:49:00,167 --> 01:49:02,613
But I made an entire movie.

1557
01:49:05,268 --> 01:49:05,871
Come out.

1558
01:49:06,434 --> 01:49:07,174
Keep this.

1559
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:18,340
"Everyone will spit on you
eating that dreaded betel-leaf."

1560
01:49:18,401 --> 01:49:21,382
"That dreaded betel leaf..."

1561
01:49:21,434 --> 01:49:23,414
"That dreaded betel leaf..."

1562
01:49:23,467 --> 01:49:24,445
"That dreaded betel leaf..."

1563
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:26,810
Run, or else...

1564
01:49:27,967 --> 01:49:29,969
Someone hereto see you.

1565
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,079
Forgive me, Daata sir.

1566
01:49:32,334 --> 01:49:34,974
But we're heavily under pressure.

1567
01:49:40,134 --> 01:49:40,874
Papa.

1568
01:49:40,934 --> 01:49:43,414
Dear. It's nothing.

1569
01:49:43,467 --> 01:49:44,411
It's nothing.

1570
01:49:44,467 --> 01:49:45,969
Tell her.

1571
01:49:46,034 --> 01:49:49,072
She saw everyone on television.
- So what?

1572
01:49:49,601 --> 01:49:52,514
Politicians only get bail
not jailed in this country.

1573
01:49:52,567 --> 01:49:54,046
Daata sir's right.

1574
01:49:54,834 --> 01:49:56,245
Don't worry, dear.

1575
01:49:56,834 --> 01:49:58,211
Don't cry.

1576
01:49:59,001 --> 01:50:00,036
Don't cry.

1577
01:50:01,001 --> 01:50:02,036
Don't cry.

1578
01:50:10,501 --> 01:50:13,414
Singh!

1579
01:50:46,234 --> 01:50:47,907
I can endure anything...

1580
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:51,778
...but, not tears
in my daughter's eyes.

1581
01:50:53,467 --> 01:50:55,105
Now it's going to rain.

1582
01:50:57,068 --> 01:50:58,274
Rain!

1583
01:51:00,134 --> 01:51:02,375
Of money. Power.

1584
01:51:03,767 --> 01:51:06,680
I'll make you suffer.

1585
01:51:08,034 --> 01:51:11,675
You will run out of life,
but not tears.

1586
01:51:17,267 --> 01:51:20,680
And that was just one percent...

1587
01:51:21,267 --> 01:51:24,271
When you were begging
for your wife... - Shut up!

1588
01:51:27,934 --> 01:51:30,744
Money and power couldn't
save Ravan either.

1589
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,006
You're no match.

1590
01:51:33,867 --> 01:51:36,211
I'll beat you to a pulp...

1591
01:51:36,267 --> 01:51:38,110
...and your power won't
be able to save you.

1592
01:51:38,167 --> 01:51:40,943
And you will run out
of wealth fixing your bones.

1593
01:51:41,267 --> 01:51:42,075
Get out!

1594
01:51:56,034 --> 01:51:59,038
I never saw Singh
Saab so angry before.

1595
01:52:04,034 --> 01:52:07,709
The rage within him had vented out.

1596
01:52:10,267 --> 01:52:14,010
Revenge.
The feeling he wanted to forget...

1597
01:52:14,767 --> 01:52:17,270
...was burning in his eyes like fire.

1598
01:52:18,267 --> 01:52:19,678
We were all scared.

1599
01:52:20,134 --> 01:52:22,045
That Bhudev's provocation...

1600
01:52:22,834 --> 01:52:25,212
...may make him lose this battle.

1601
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:30,011
Because this battle
had turned into a war.

1602
01:52:33,834 --> 01:52:36,075
Singh Saab spent days and nights...

1603
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,072
...to gather evidence against Bhudev.

1604
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:42,311
So that Bhudev doesn't get bail.

1605
01:52:43,834 --> 01:52:46,041
He forgot all about himself.

1606
01:52:47,134 --> 01:52:49,341
He didn't have time...

1607
01:52:50,134 --> 01:52:53,013
...to spend few moments
with the memories of his wife.

1608
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,277
Or to talk to his sister.

1609
01:52:57,734 --> 01:53:01,238
Maybe that's why other day...

1610
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:07,044
Brother!

1611
01:53:07,967 --> 01:53:09,207
Where are you?

1612
01:53:10,734 --> 01:53:11,303
Come, Param.

1613
01:53:12,134 --> 01:53:13,704
Mrs. Simar. You?

1614
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,981
I am Sikha.
We talked over the phone.

1615
01:53:18,034 --> 01:53:20,071
So you are Sikha.

1616
01:53:20,667 --> 01:53:23,170
Where's my brother?
- We'll have to do it?

1617
01:53:27,034 --> 01:53:28,604
Oh Sunder munder hoye

1618
01:53:28,667 --> 01:53:29,771
Who will think about you

1619
01:53:29,834 --> 01:53:31,279
He is dulla bhatti

1620
01:53:31,567 --> 01:53:33,046
Dulla's daughter got married

1621
01:53:33,101 --> 01:53:34,136
He gave 1kg sugar

1622
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:35,645
He is dulla bhatti

1623
01:53:35,701 --> 01:53:37,044
Dulla's daughter got married

1624
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:39,307
But her shawl is torn

1625
01:53:40,834 --> 01:53:42,643
Because of this our
case will be more strong

1626
01:53:43,267 --> 01:53:44,905
She is wearing a red suit

1627
01:53:44,967 --> 01:53:47,004
But her shawl is torn

1628
01:53:48,034 --> 01:53:48,842
Guddi?

1629
01:53:54,101 --> 01:53:55,580
He is dulla bhatti

1630
01:53:55,634 --> 01:53:57,170
Dulla's daughter got married

1631
01:53:57,734 --> 01:53:59,805
But her shawl is torn

1632
01:53:59,867 --> 01:54:01,073
She is wearing a red suit

1633
01:54:01,134 --> 01:54:02,704
He gave 1kg sugar

1634
01:54:03,834 --> 01:54:06,246
The uncle made choori!
The landlords looted it!

1635
01:54:06,301 --> 01:54:07,245
Guddi?

1636
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:18,245
Brother!

1637
01:54:19,701 --> 01:54:20,509
Brother!

1638
01:54:20,801 --> 01:54:22,075
What are you doing here?

1639
01:54:25,767 --> 01:54:26,745
I told you.

1640
01:54:26,801 --> 01:54:29,042
I'll come meet you whenever needed.

1641
01:54:32,234 --> 01:54:34,771
What did I tell you?

1642
01:54:35,068 --> 01:54:36,206
Didn't I tell you, Simar?

1643
01:54:37,767 --> 01:54:39,769
Come on, take her back.

1644
01:54:39,834 --> 01:54:41,836
She...she doesn't understand.

1645
01:54:41,901 --> 01:54:45,144
Right. I don't understand.

1646
01:54:45,634 --> 01:54:47,045
I don't understand at all.

1647
01:54:47,701 --> 01:54:49,203
I couldn't understand...

1648
01:54:49,967 --> 01:54:53,881
...when you were in
jail and sent me far away.

1649
01:54:56,801 --> 01:54:58,041
I didn't understand...

1650
01:54:58,534 --> 01:55:01,913
...when I sent you Rakhis
through brother Gullu.

1651
01:55:05,034 --> 01:55:06,104
Seven years.

1652
01:55:09,034 --> 01:55:12,538
Seven years I couldn't
tie you the Rakhi.

1653
01:55:15,734 --> 01:55:17,111
And I couldn't understand either...

1654
01:55:18,234 --> 01:55:19,713
...when you didn't come see me...

1655
01:55:19,767 --> 01:55:21,576
mailer getting out of jail.

1656
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:26,712
What kind of a war is this, brother?

1657
01:55:27,534 --> 01:55:29,036
It's changed our relationship.

1658
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:33,872
What are you afraid of now?

1659
01:55:33,934 --> 01:55:35,743
Bhudev's behind bars now.

1660
01:55:37,034 --> 01:55:39,241
Brother. Listen to me.

1661
01:55:39,534 --> 01:55:40,808
I am not going anywhere.

1662
01:55:40,867 --> 01:55:43,006
I am staying right here.
I'm staying with you, that's it.

1663
01:56:04,167 --> 01:56:05,840
Are you my uncle?

1664
01:56:19,734 --> 01:56:21,680
Where's your underwear?

1665
01:56:24,034 --> 01:56:26,605
Mom says you're Superman.

1666
01:56:45,901 --> 01:56:46,606
Guddi.

1667
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:48,801
I won't.

1668
01:56:50,234 --> 01:56:51,178
Guddi.

1669
01:56:54,234 --> 01:56:55,645
Brother.

1670
01:56:58,134 --> 01:57:01,081
You know you're the only
one I have in this world.

1671
01:57:01,934 --> 01:57:04,346
I don't want to lose you.

1672
01:57:11,534 --> 01:57:12,342
Brother.

1673
01:57:14,434 --> 01:57:15,538
I am your sister.

1674
01:57:18,667 --> 01:57:24,948
If anyone dares to harm me,
I will kill him.

1675
01:57:27,401 --> 01:57:28,880
And, will you spare them?

1676
01:57:39,667 --> 01:57:41,044
This is hooliganism, Singh Sir.

1677
01:57:41,501 --> 01:57:42,479
Bhudev's goons have surrounded...

1678
01:57:42,534 --> 01:57:43,877
...the building from the back...

1679
01:57:43,934 --> 01:57:45,743
...and even the police
can't control them.

1680
01:57:52,367 --> 01:57:53,846
Stop. Move.

1681
01:57:53,901 --> 01:57:56,381
Move. Move back.

1682
01:57:56,434 --> 01:57:58,710
I won't spare that Singh Saab.

1683
01:57:59,034 --> 01:58:00,104
Stay back.

1684
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:03,907
Focus on Lallan. Yes, that way.

1685
01:58:04,767 --> 01:58:05,802
No violence!

1686
01:58:05,867 --> 01:58:06,811
No violence!

1687
01:58:07,101 --> 01:58:08,876
No one will resort to violence.

1688
01:58:08,934 --> 01:58:10,675
We're the residents
of Gandhi's India.

1689
01:58:11,434 --> 01:58:13,744
You call yourself the
residents of Gandhi's India.

1690
01:58:15,067 --> 01:58:16,569
You've already broken all the laws.

1691
01:58:16,967 --> 01:58:19,948
The court's ordered Bhudev's men...

1692
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,675
...to stay 500 meters away
from People's party Office.

1693
01:58:23,734 --> 01:58:24,610
Get out!

1694
01:58:24,667 --> 01:58:26,408
So come charge at us!

1695
01:58:26,467 --> 01:58:27,468
Handcuff us!

1696
01:58:27,534 --> 01:58:28,035
Listen to me.

1697
01:58:28,367 --> 01:58:29,641
I am speaking here.

1698
01:58:29,934 --> 01:58:32,540
I am not breaking any law.

1699
01:58:32,601 --> 01:58:34,808
I am only saving Singh Saab...

1700
01:58:34,868 --> 01:58:38,975
...from the ferociousness
of Bhudev's supporters?

1701
01:58:39,034 --> 01:58:41,537
Sir, that's 'Fury'
not ferociousness.

1702
01:58:41,601 --> 01:58:43,638
Don't humiliate me
in front of the media.

1703
01:58:43,701 --> 01:58:44,543
Yes, fury.

1704
01:58:44,601 --> 01:58:47,582
I am saving you from their anger.

1705
01:58:47,634 --> 01:58:49,705
Otherwise they will
burn you down to ashes.

1706
01:58:49,767 --> 01:58:54,045
He's was masquerading
as Singh Saab...

1707
01:58:54,334 --> 01:58:55,745
...but, now he's been exposed.

1708
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:57,473
He doesn't want 10 million anymore.

1709
01:58:57,534 --> 01:58:58,979
Now he wants 1 billion

1710
01:58:59,034 --> 01:59:00,377
Did you hear?

1711
01:59:00,434 --> 01:59:01,970
Have you seen Bhudev's
medical report? - Take a look.

1712
01:59:02,367 --> 01:59:03,402
Show them.

1713
01:59:03,734 --> 01:59:04,644
He drugged Bhudev's drink...

1714
01:59:04,701 --> 01:59:06,374
...and tricked him
into drinking this...

1715
01:59:06,434 --> 01:59:07,777
...and made him say all those things.

1716
01:59:07,834 --> 01:59:08,835
Yes. You see...

1717
01:59:08,901 --> 01:59:12,405
This is why I request
you Singh Saab...

1718
01:59:12,467 --> 01:59:14,708
...please withdraw your case.

1719
01:59:15,267 --> 01:59:15,870
Otherwise...

1720
01:59:16,367 --> 01:59:17,209
Otherwise...

1721
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:18,774
Otherwise I...

1722
01:59:19,334 --> 01:59:23,680
Will publicly commit
self-molestation.

1723
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:27,538
Sir, that's self-immolation.

1724
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:29,473
Don't both of them burn you? - Yes.

1725
01:59:29,534 --> 01:59:33,346
I will commit self-immolation.

1726
01:59:34,901 --> 01:59:36,847
You are great.

1727
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:40,848
And with me Govardhan
will do it too.

1728
01:59:41,734 --> 01:59:45,238
And with us, Sultan too.

1729
01:59:46,501 --> 01:59:48,481
Commando. Trilok.

1730
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:49,505
Him, him and him.

1731
01:59:49,567 --> 01:59:49,977
And him.

1732
01:59:50,267 --> 01:59:51,871
All of us will commit
self-immolation.

1733
01:59:51,934 --> 01:59:53,379
Yes. Charge ahead.

1734
01:59:53,434 --> 01:59:55,573
Get the kerosene.

1735
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:57,970
Wait. Wait.

1736
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:00,978
Your kerosene must
be adulterated as well.

1737
02:00:01,434 --> 02:00:03,311
You'll only suffer to death.

1738
02:00:04,267 --> 02:00:04,802
Murli.

1739
02:00:04,867 --> 02:00:06,642
Remember that can of
petrol in the jeep? - Yes.

1740
02:00:07,267 --> 02:00:07,904
Go get it.

1741
02:00:07,967 --> 02:00:08,843
Get it.

1742
02:00:09,767 --> 02:00:10,643
Here you go.

1743
02:00:11,201 --> 02:00:12,236
He's brought it.

1744
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:14,737
Here you go.

1745
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,473
Stop. - What is he doing?

1746
02:00:16,534 --> 02:00:17,911
Stop. - Take it.

1747
02:00:19,401 --> 02:00:21,312
It'll reduce you to ashes.

1748
02:00:21,367 --> 02:00:22,710
Not a moment of pain.

1749
02:00:23,267 --> 02:00:23,745
No.

1750
02:00:41,467 --> 02:00:43,674
All Hold you to do was...

1751
02:00:43,734 --> 02:00:46,908
...take a 1000 goons and
beat that Singh to pulp...

1752
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:49,703
...so that he runs out of life,
not tears.

1753
02:00:49,967 --> 02:00:51,913
Boss, that's exactly
what I tried to do.

1754
02:00:52,234 --> 02:00:54,840
But, the police arrived
at the wrong time.

1755
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:58,474
You see,
I was playing a 'ismart' game...

1756
02:00:58,534 --> 02:01:01,242
That's 'Smart'. - Shut up!

1757
02:01:01,501 --> 02:01:02,605
Listen!

1758
02:01:02,901 --> 02:01:05,074
Now that the game has changed,
do as I say.

1759
02:01:05,834 --> 02:01:09,441
That Singh poured petrol,
lit a match...

1760
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:13,539
...so lodge an FIR against
him and put him behind bars.

1761
02:01:13,901 --> 02:01:17,405
I'll sick all the inmates on him.

1762
02:01:17,467 --> 02:01:19,344
No, you don't know.

1763
02:01:19,401 --> 02:01:20,812
He's really smart.

1764
02:01:22,867 --> 02:01:25,438
The entire police and
media are on his side.

1765
02:01:27,267 --> 02:01:28,610
Watch the TV.

1766
02:01:28,667 --> 02:01:30,169
Breaking news.

1767
02:01:30,234 --> 02:01:31,736
Bhudev Sing's supporters...

1768
02:01:31,801 --> 02:01:35,374
...disregarded the court's orders
and held a rally against Singh Saab.

1769
02:01:35,434 --> 02:01:37,414
They tried to burn him with petrol.

1770
02:01:37,468 --> 02:01:40,449
The fire and fury of the
people have evoked together.

1771
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:42,571
The police tried
to avert this matter...

1772
02:01:42,634 --> 02:01:43,806
But the goons didn't listen.

1773
02:01:43,868 --> 02:01:48,214
In the end, the police and
people together beat up the goons.

1774
02:01:48,267 --> 02:01:49,746
What are you saying you wretch?

1775
02:01:50,134 --> 02:01:52,671
Call her. - I already did.

1776
02:01:52,734 --> 02:01:54,407
She's a great journalist.

1777
02:01:54,467 --> 02:01:55,172
Quiet.

1778
02:01:56,201 --> 02:01:57,077
Hey girl.

1779
02:01:57,467 --> 02:01:59,378
Why are you airing the wrong report?

1780
02:01:59,434 --> 02:02:01,209
Mr. Bhudev Singh.

1781
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:04,538
When you can manage
the police and press...

1782
02:02:05,167 --> 02:02:09,274
...and air wrong reports
to prove your lie...

1783
02:02:10,367 --> 02:02:14,247
...then, can't we air a
fake report for an honest man?

1784
02:02:15,067 --> 02:02:16,512
Like you said.

1785
02:02:16,567 --> 02:02:17,978
Times have changed.

1786
02:02:20,034 --> 02:02:23,413
100 of the goldsmith,
one of the ironsmith.

1787
02:02:29,534 --> 02:02:31,707
Control your anger, sir.

1788
02:02:32,367 --> 02:02:33,778
Use it when the time is right.

1789
02:02:49,767 --> 02:02:55,774
100 blows of the ironsmith,
and one blow of Bhudev Singh.

1790
02:03:11,768 --> 02:03:13,645
There's a big movement today.

1791
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,104
Everyone's gone there.

1792
02:03:15,401 --> 02:03:17,677
Yes, Ashwini's gone with brother.

1793
02:03:18,067 --> 02:03:19,045
Yes.

1794
02:03:31,301 --> 02:03:32,371
Wait.

1795
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:15,842
Param.

1796
02:04:40,001 --> 02:04:44,143
"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."

1797
02:04:48,467 --> 02:04:52,472
"How I wonder what you are?"

1798
02:04:52,534 --> 02:04:53,410
Param!

1799
02:05:00,034 --> 02:05:01,377
You will die.

1800
02:05:03,034 --> 02:05:04,342
You will die.

1801
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:10,980
My brother won't spare you.

1802
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:23,010
Param. Param, come here.

1803
02:05:27,267 --> 02:05:30,305
You have tortured
women and children.

1804
02:05:31,134 --> 02:05:32,636
Now we journalists...

1805
02:05:32,934 --> 02:05:35,210
...will have to pick-up
the gun for justice.

1806
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:38,411
Simar. Run away with the boy.

1807
02:05:41,001 --> 02:05:41,979
No smart moves.

1808
02:05:42,701 --> 02:05:44,203
But You... - No one will move.

1809
02:05:45,134 --> 02:05:46,374
Go on, Simar. I am coming.

1810
02:05:46,667 --> 02:05:47,611
Let's go Param.

1811
02:05:47,901 --> 02:05:48,606
Get in that room.

1812
02:05:48,967 --> 02:05:50,310
Everyone get in that room.

1813
02:05:51,267 --> 02:05:52,371
Get in.

1814
02:05:54,367 --> 02:05:56,643
If she's telling us, let's go.
- Come on. Hurry up.

1815
02:05:56,701 --> 02:05:57,236
Get in.

1816
02:05:58,334 --> 02:06:01,372
Lock us in.

1817
02:06:02,967 --> 02:06:05,573
Shikha, call up brother.

1818
02:06:05,967 --> 02:06:06,570
Yes.

1819
02:06:06,867 --> 02:06:09,575
Oh my, God. I left my phone behind.

1820
02:06:11,634 --> 02:06:13,113
Police station.

1821
02:06:18,434 --> 02:06:19,344
What happened?

1822
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:23,006
I think we've run out of diesel.

1823
02:06:23,467 --> 02:06:25,538
What? What now?

1824
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:32,845
How will we tell brother we're here?

1825
02:06:34,534 --> 02:06:35,979
Mom. - Param.

1826
02:06:37,034 --> 02:06:39,105
God. My mobile...

1827
02:06:57,434 --> 02:06:58,139
Mom.

1828
02:06:58,834 --> 02:07:00,541
Simar, run. - Come on, Param.

1829
02:07:17,401 --> 02:07:18,175
Stop.

1830
02:07:32,801 --> 02:07:35,475
Brother!

1831
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:45,074
Bhudev.

1832
02:08:21,134 --> 02:08:25,776
The children have to pay
for their elder's mistakes.

1833
02:08:25,834 --> 02:08:27,279
That's the law.

1834
02:08:27,867 --> 02:08:32,873
Now you know,
I am the law and the lawmaker.

1835
02:08:32,934 --> 02:08:34,675
Stop blabbering!

1836
02:08:35,067 --> 02:08:36,341
Where's my sister?

1837
02:08:40,967 --> 02:08:42,173
I am Bhudev.

1838
02:08:42,234 --> 02:08:43,338
The lord of ghosts.

1839
02:08:43,734 --> 02:08:45,372
Sultan. Show him!

1840
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:55,911
Uncle.

1841
02:08:56,700 --> 02:08:57,804
Guddi.

1842
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:16,376
Look at him get restless.

1843
02:09:20,401 --> 02:09:22,642
Bhudev!

1844
02:09:38,367 --> 02:09:40,347
No, no, no.

1845
02:09:40,767 --> 02:09:42,303
Isn't this what you wanted?

1846
02:09:42,367 --> 02:09:43,869
I've turned into a demon.

1847
02:09:43,934 --> 02:09:44,912
Daughter.

1848
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:47,146
But listen carefully.

1849
02:09:47,634 --> 02:09:50,012
What happened with
Minnie is the past.

1850
02:09:51,034 --> 02:09:55,278
If you harm my sister or her son...

1851
02:09:55,334 --> 02:09:57,336
...then I'll throw
your daughter down.

1852
02:09:57,401 --> 02:09:58,903
No, no, no.

1853
02:09:59,167 --> 02:10:01,374
I'll set them free.

1854
02:10:01,801 --> 02:10:03,906
Let my daughter go.

1855
02:10:03,967 --> 02:10:05,878
Sultan. Let them go.

1856
02:10:16,134 --> 02:10:17,807
Brother.

1857
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:29,574
Brother.

1858
02:10:54,634 --> 02:10:55,874
Brother.

1859
02:10:55,934 --> 02:10:56,742
Uncle!

1860
02:11:02,134 --> 02:11:06,947
Guddi!

1861
02:11:37,134 --> 02:11:39,842
Papa. Papa. - My child.

1862
02:13:38,167 --> 02:13:38,645
Leave.

1863
02:13:38,968 --> 02:13:40,003
Let me go. - You want to go.

1864
02:13:40,067 --> 02:13:40,841
Simar.

1865
02:13:40,901 --> 02:13:44,678
Fine, I'll send you...to
your sister-in-law.

1866
02:13:45,834 --> 02:13:49,077
I am the one who poisoned her.

1867
02:15:02,834 --> 02:15:03,710
Brother.

1868
02:15:17,634 --> 02:15:18,840
Stop.

1869
02:15:24,368 --> 02:15:26,370
Brother! Brother!

1870
02:15:26,834 --> 02:15:32,250
Singh...Saab.
You want to Great, don't you?

1871
02:15:32,901 --> 02:15:35,040
You're alive to gain respect.

1872
02:15:36,467 --> 02:15:37,673
Respect!

1873
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:44,513
So that tomorrow, when he dies...

1874
02:15:45,534 --> 02:15:47,912
...he can show his wife
his head held with pride.

1875
02:15:47,967 --> 02:15:49,344
Isn't that what you want?

1876
02:15:50,534 --> 02:15:52,571
I won't let that happen.

1877
02:15:54,101 --> 02:15:57,048
You dared to touch my daughter.

1878
02:15:58,567 --> 02:16:01,776
I will cut-off this head.

1879
02:16:02,634 --> 02:16:06,673
You will suffer to death.

1880
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,411
Sikh.

1881
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:17,611
You think you're the
benefactors of the helpless.

1882
02:16:18,667 --> 02:16:21,910
Today I'll show you your stature.

1883
02:16:24,534 --> 02:16:25,308
Your turban.

1884
02:16:27,901 --> 02:16:28,709
Your turban.

1885
02:16:30,334 --> 02:16:31,972
You Sikh!

1886
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:36,308
Isn't your turban your honor?

1887
02:16:37,867 --> 02:16:41,974
I'm going to maul it under my feet.

1888
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:28,369
Why you...

1889
02:17:28,434 --> 02:17:29,708
Catch him.

1890
02:17:29,967 --> 02:17:30,809
Param.

1891
02:17:57,267 --> 02:17:58,177
Turban.

1892
02:17:59,567 --> 02:18:00,477
Sikh!

1893
02:18:02,167 --> 02:18:03,077
Sardars!

1894
02:18:04,368 --> 02:18:07,076
The one who diminished inequality.

1895
02:18:07,567 --> 02:18:09,103
<i>Gurunanak Deviâ€œ!</i>

1896
02:18:10,701 --> 02:18:13,773
Sacrificed his family
for righteousness.

1897
02:18:14,734 --> 02:18:16,543
Guru Gobind Singh!

1898
02:18:17,867 --> 02:18:20,211
Sikh.

1899
02:18:41,634 --> 02:18:45,776
Happily accepted death penalty.

1900
02:18:47,234 --> 02:18:49,373
Martyr Bhagat Singh.

1901
02:18:51,268 --> 02:18:52,508
Sikh.

1902
02:19:08,201 --> 02:19:11,273
When a Sikh has his
prey in his clutches...

1903
02:19:11,601 --> 02:19:14,104
...his bone start to rattle.

1904
02:19:16,767 --> 02:19:18,246
Rattle!

1905
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:24,243
Rattle! Rattle! Rattle! Rattle!

1906
02:19:32,834 --> 02:19:34,711
Papal

1907
02:20:10,267 --> 02:20:11,541
Doctor.

1908
02:20:12,134 --> 02:20:13,112
This is wrong.

1909
02:20:13,434 --> 02:20:17,405
Wasn't it wrong when
you kidnapped my son?

1910
02:20:19,367 --> 02:20:21,711
Wasn't it wrong
when you stopped me...

1911
02:20:22,034 --> 02:20:23,707
...from operating
on the Collector's wife.

1912
02:20:26,001 --> 02:20:27,674
I still regret that.

1913
02:20:28,034 --> 02:20:30,412
Do you know...my son...

1914
02:20:30,467 --> 02:20:32,208
...hasn't emerged
from that trauma yet.

1915
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,138
And you say this is wrong.

1916
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,645
I won't conduct this operation.

1917
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:38,236
She's in critical condition.

1918
02:20:38,301 --> 02:20:39,371
I am sorry.

1919
02:20:39,434 --> 02:20:40,674
I'm sorry. - Doctor.

1920
02:20:40,734 --> 02:20:43,340
Don't punish my daughter
for my crimes.

1921
02:20:43,400 --> 02:20:44,538
Please, don't punish her.

1922
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:45,704
That's the law.

1923
02:20:46,667 --> 02:20:48,044
That's what you said.

1924
02:20:49,767 --> 02:20:54,648
The children have to
pay for their elders mistake.

1925
02:21:00,233 --> 02:21:01,143
Doctor.

1926
02:21:03,501 --> 02:21:05,276
I want to tell you a story. - Yes.

1927
02:21:08,134 --> 02:21:11,206
There was once a saint
who climbed down the stairs...

1928
02:21:11,267 --> 02:21:13,008
...everyday to venerate
the river Ganga.

1929
02:21:13,634 --> 02:21:15,443
He was often stung by a scorpion...

1930
02:21:15,967 --> 02:21:18,174
...and he would pick
him up and keep him aside.

1931
02:21:18,934 --> 02:21:20,174
Someone asked him...

1932
02:21:20,634 --> 02:21:22,079
...the scorpion stings you everyday...

1933
02:21:22,134 --> 02:21:25,047
...but, why do you
simply set it aside.

1934
02:21:25,534 --> 02:21:26,535
The saint said...

1935
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:31,004
...a scorpion doesn't
forget his duty...

1936
02:21:32,167 --> 02:21:35,637
...so as a saint,
how can I forget mine.

1937
02:21:41,434 --> 02:21:44,176
I am no saint, doctor.

1938
02:21:45,634 --> 02:21:47,545
I request you.

1939
02:21:49,167 --> 02:21:53,343
Don't let her pay
for her father's sins.

1940
02:21:53,401 --> 02:21:59,010
"Even if he's hurl,
he'll still forgive."

1941
02:21:59,401 --> 02:22:05,147
"He'll forget his pain,
and always do justice."

1942
02:22:05,634 --> 02:22:10,583
"He'll teach you
revenge is unimportant."

1943
02:22:10,867 --> 02:22:13,541
"Singh Saab the Great."

1944
02:22:13,834 --> 02:22:16,906
"Singh Saab the Great."

1945
02:22:16,967 --> 02:22:20,073
"Singh Saab the Great."

1946
02:22:20,134 --> 02:22:24,344
"Singh Saab the Great."

1947
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,140
My Sardar is Handsome and colorful

1948
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:35,840
My sardar is colorful

1949
02:22:36,101 --> 02:22:39,310
In your color, Let me Love You

1950
02:22:39,367 --> 02:22:41,938
Let Me love you

1951
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:48,315
I should ask your tears from god

1952
02:22:48,367 --> 02:22:55,581
My Sardar is Handsome and colorful

1953
02:23:00,901 --> 02:23:03,279
'Every time we miss
our sweetheart..."

1954
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:06,881
...it searches our heart.'

1955
02:23:08,834 --> 02:23:09,904
'Such love.'

1956
02:23:10,167 --> 02:23:12,943
'Singh Saab could have
united with his wife...

1957
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,911
...if he wanted to.'

1958
02:23:15,367 --> 02:23:17,313
But he wanted to live.

1959
02:23:17,367 --> 02:23:18,869
For the smile...

1960
02:23:19,400 --> 02:23:21,471
...on his wife's face.

1961
02:23:21,967 --> 02:23:24,311
Whenever he did a good deed.

1962
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:28,009
Truly, it's the result
of his goodness...

1963
02:23:28,567 --> 02:23:31,912
...that, a man like Bhudev...

1964
02:23:32,901 --> 02:23:35,108
...contributed a huge amount
of his wealth to this change.

1965
02:23:37,501 --> 02:23:38,275
And me.

1966
02:23:38,900 --> 02:23:42,370
I joined Singh Saab's
campaign forever.

1967
02:23:44,067 --> 02:23:46,138
Because, there's too
much pain in this world.

1968
02:23:47,467 --> 02:23:49,947
And only a few who share it.
