1
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,620
Why did you want 
to meet me, John?

2
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,700
Well, Sunnycha...

3
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,450
I've told you many times...

4
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,080
Doing gold business by 
reducing the making charges...

5
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,660
Don't do it on our street!

6
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,620
Why I have spent Lakhs and 
kept a shop open here then?

7
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,250
Hey John!

8
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,250
The business that 
my dad taught me...

9
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,950
is not to cheat the poor people who wish 
for a little gold, and come to buy it.

10
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't want to make 
money by doing that.

11
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,580
So don't call me again 
to say this, John.

12
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,040
I'm leaving then.

13
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,160
Mom! Mom! 
- What is it?

14
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,330
Everyone is going for the 
tour from the school, mom!

15
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,540
Can you please tell Advocate Madam?

16
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,830
If I tell her, 
she'll do it for us.

17
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,620
But we shouldn't 
say this to her.

18
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,370
It's not right.

19
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,370
My son should study really well.

20
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,330
And you should reach great 
heights like Advocate Madam.

21
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,330
Don't finish this off.

22
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,620
Advocate Madam has not reached.

23
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,540
Sit down.

24
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,700
Advocate Madam!

25
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Son...

26
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,620
Advocate Madam...

27
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,290
Mom!

28
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,330
Mom!

29
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,790
Mom!

30
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,830
Mom!

31
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,450
Mom!

32
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,750
Mom!

33
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Mom!

34
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,790
Advocate Madam...

35
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,290
I heard that Edakkadan 
John is out on bail?

36
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,910
Yes, Balan.

37
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,910
Then you should be 
careful, Advocate Madam.

38
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,450
You puny little fellow! 
- Let him go!

39
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,000
It's the son of that woman who 
got slashed by mistake and died.

40
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,290
Get up and go!

41
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,080
And come when you're grown up!

42
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,370
How are you now, Johnetta? 
- I have a slight fever. It's okay.

43
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,290
Shall we meet the doctor on the way? 
- Later. Get into the car.

44
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
What?

45
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,330
Today...

46
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Six...

47
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,410
Tomorrow...

48
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,410
Seven...

49
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,200
Are you barking, you dog?

50
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,660
He's the one who killed 
Edakkadan Johnettan.

51
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
This guy?

52
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,330
He kept a sword into the 
mouth of a rabid dog.

53
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,450
Then he slashed him 
at the market.

54
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,250
He just made a scrape then.

55
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,540
But on the 7th day, 
John was dead.

56
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,540
What's your name? 
- Giri.

57
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,870
Where are you from?

58
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Pullu.

59
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,700
So you are 'Pullu Giri'.

60
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Sign on it!

61
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,620
What's your name? 
- Ali.

62
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,620
What?

63
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,330
Hey!

64
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Wash it.

65
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,830
Didn't he wash his plate? 
Then why are you kicking him?

66
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,540
You...!!

67
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,830
You..!!

68
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,330
Apart from stories of 
festival grandeur,

69
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,750
the cultural city of 
Thrisshur has another story.

70
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,290
A blood-stained story of 
vengeance among the goons.

71
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,660
After Thrisshivaperoor 
became Thrissur,

72
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
there are no accounts of lives 
lost fighting each other,

73
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,540
in the name of vendetta.

74
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,660
This is a festival season.

75
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,450
Amidst human lives full of rage,

76
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,580
the season of the one who took 
a sword for self-defense.

77
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,870
The season of Pullu Giri, 
who became a part of this city later on.

78
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
Oh no!

79
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Son!

80
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,660
Son!

81
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,540
Oh no! 
My son!

82
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,660
Son! 
My son!

83
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,870
Son!

84
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,410
My child!

85
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,750
Son!

86
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,790
My son!

87
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,200
My dear...!!

88
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,700
Are we late? 
- No.

89
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,870
Come.

90
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,620
How come Madam is also with 
you today, George sir?

91
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
There's a programme at 
our daughter's school.

92
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,080
Narayana, get sir his 
regular strong tea.

93
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,120
She has practiced well, right?

94
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,750
Yeah. 
- She's really tensed.

95
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,370
She spoke to me in the morning...

96
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,290
What are you doing? 
Shucks!

97
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,120
I... By mistake... 
Sorry.

98
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,450
Sorry? You're saying sorry 
after pouring hot tea over me?

99
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,290
Hey! Stop it, kiddo!

100
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,870
He's elder to you after all, right?

101
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,910
He didn't do it on purpose, right?

102
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,200
Let it go. 
- Shall I pour it over your head then?

103
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,790
Don't show off too much. 
Mind your own business.

104
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,830
What?

105
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,620
What's your problem?

106
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Where do you guys stay?

107
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,950
Showing off after coming here? 
Sit there!

108
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,910
No. Don't create an issue.

109
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,910
Wait there, sir.

110
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,290
Kiddo, if you show off too much...

111
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,370
you'll end up as a 
photo on the wall!

112
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Understood?

113
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,750
Don't create an issue. 
- Hey! There's no issue.

114
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,910
You sit there, sir.

115
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,620
Sit there, Chechi.

116
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,950
Sit down, sir.

117
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
It's our area.

118
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,910
No one will show off here, okay?

119
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Come on!

120
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,870
Let's go.

121
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,330
Sorry.

122
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,830
Oh no!

123
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,910
Oh no!

124
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,410
Hi Venkat.

125
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,410
Yeah, yeah. 
Yesterday night by 11.

126
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,950
Nothing much. 
Official procedures.

127
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,830
I went to the office & took charge.

128
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,580
Now I'm taking a round 
around Thekkinkadu ground.

129
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,750
To be frank, a new start after 
encircling Lord Vadakkumnathan...

130
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,450
... as City Police Commissioner.

131
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,040
- It's a sub-registrar 
who has been murdered.

132
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,330
- His name is George.

133
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,830
Hey Venkat. 
Can I call you back?

134
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,500
- He is the Thrisshur sub-registrar.

135
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,370
- Town CI is on his way there.

136
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,910
Control room DySP is on the way.

137
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Commissioner.

138
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
Move! Move!

139
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,620
Sir, anti-crime squad. 
Kumar.

140
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
What's the update?

141
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,870
It's an issue which started from 
a small argument here, sir.

142
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,500
Sir, I am Anand.

143
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,450
We've found the purse of a guy who 
was with the culprits. - Good.

144
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,830
He has been identified 
by the man in this shop.

145
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,540
Sir, Sam. Police surgeon. 
- Tell me.

146
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,750
It's a job by someone 
who knows his job well.

147
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,330
Without shedding even 
a drop of blood,

148
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,540
with just one punch in one 
minute, the man was dead.

149
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,200
I didn't get you. 
- Yeah. I'll explain.

150
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,080
It's a weapon usually seen 
with local pick-pockets.

151
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
It's called a pen-knife.

152
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,330
It looks like a normal pen.

153
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,790
This weapon is like the nib 
of the pen coming out.

154
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,080
Keeping at close range 
of the chest, one lock!

155
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,450
The very next moment, 
the victim would be dead.

156
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,330
So this is not a natural incident?

157
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,410
Definitely not.

158
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,370
Sir, Town East SI.

159
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,000
I've got all the details of 
the guy who lost his purse.

160
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,700
Good. 
Any other information?

161
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,290
We're collecting details, sir.

162
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,750
So this guy was a sub-registrar?

163
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,160
Yes, sir. He comes here 
to drink tea regularly.

164
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,120
Move! Move! - The incident happened 
when he came here with his wife today.

165
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,870
You all meet me in the office.

166
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,870
Sir!

167
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Move!

168
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,660
Sir...

169
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,330
This guy is with Giri, who used 
to do quotation jobs earlier.

170
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,120
Sir, this Giri has been 
inactive for a while now.

171
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,000
While he was, he had 
many big cases.

172
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,370
Quotation cases? 
- Sir...

173
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,080
There's an advocate here. 
A very shrewd senior lawyer.

174
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,290
Rajalakshmi. 
- She's the one who keeps protecting Giri.

175
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,290
We've locked him many times.

176
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,080
Finally we added his name 
on the goons' list too.

177
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,660
If this Advocate Rajalakshmi comes wearing 
her coat, even the judge would stand up.

178
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Giri was raised by Advocate 
Rajalakshmi, like her own son.

179
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,580
And that judge who stood up, 
must have been one of her juniors.

180
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,540
This guy joined Giri when 
he was really young.

181
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,540
It was Giri who sent him to 
school & college to study.

182
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,160
Sir, from our enquiry, Giri doesn't take 
this boy along for any quotation jobs.

183
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,250
He keeps the accounts at 
Giri's own water company.

184
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,000
But the witness statement says 
that he was also involved in this?

185
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,040
Anyway, bring the boy.

186
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,790
A judge standing up, 
or a lawyer freeing him,

187
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,290
would depend upon the FIR 
written by the police.

188
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,500
Let's see.

189
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,040
Muruganna, add a little extra sugar.

190
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,540
Don't you open at 
night now, Murugan?

191
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,120
No, sir. I work only during the day, 
ever since my son died.

192
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,870
It's only me and her, right?

193
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,580
Who else is this for?

194
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,000
Moreover, it's scary to be on 
the roadside in the night, sir.

195
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Madam has come.

196
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
Advocate Madam.

197
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,120
What's the situation now, Syed?

198
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,120
Commissioner has asked 
us to catch Kannan.

199
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,910
His relation with 
Giri is the problem.

200
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,000
But doesn't the department know that 
they don't have much activities now?

201
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,250
That won't work out in the 
present scenario, Madam.

202
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,410
It's a sub-registrar 
who got killed.

203
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,450
It's said in the statement that

204
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,750
an associate of a famous 
gang leader in Thrissur,

205
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,450
was present with the 
guy who killed him.

206
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,370
How's that Commissioner Moorthy?

207
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,040
Since he has come from Delhi, 
we don't know much about him.

208
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,500
And that Anand from 
anti-crime squad?

209
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,790
He's a trouble-maker.

210
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,790
He has a grudge 
against our Giri too.

211
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Madam, tea for you? 
- No, I just had one.

212
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,080
Madam, we've found 
out who it is.

213
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,450
He's from Mangalam 
colony in Alangottu.

214
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,660
There's a Subran who came 
there for a contract job.

215
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,450
This guy is his son.

216
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,080
It's a quotation from Shyam Rangan.

217
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,370
There are 5 acres of land right 
next to our Corporation stadium.

218
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,580
There's some issue regarding 
the registration of that land.

219
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,040
You try to get me the details 
of that registration, Balan.

220
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,620
Yeah, I understand.

221
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,870
Yeah, I know, man!

222
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,790
The timing was great, 
and the work was the best.

223
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,080
And some loser guy 
got in between...

224
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,200
Anyway, I'll call you back.

225
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,200
Sudeep...

226
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,870
It's not some random guy...

227
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,620
He is our Giri's boy!

228
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,410
Our Giri? To say 'our', Giri 
is your uncle's son or what?

229
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,410
Don't be angry, Sudhi.

230
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,500
That boy's purse was found there.

231
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,250
Commissioner is planning to catch 
him & make him the accused.

232
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,580
Let them catch him, Advocate!

233
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,000
I sent our boy to Valppara 
after the job yesterday.

234
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,290
This is your problem.

235
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,500
You don't know Giri.

236
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,910
All the cases charged 
against him till date,

237
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,120
were for his near and dear 
people, who are with him!

238
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,330
The best friend of such a 
guy, is in trouble now.

239
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,450
Get lost, man!

240
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,790
Our game is not just within this small 
circle called Thrisshur! Understood?

241
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,370
Subin will fly to Dubai, 
on the 12.30 PM flight.

242
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,790
Dubai or wherever...

243
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,080
He has to cross the border 
of Thrisshur district, right?

244
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,950
Go back! Go back!

245
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,120
Dude, go back! Fast!

246
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,000
Subi, no!

247
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,830
It's Giri.

248
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,290
Pullu Giri.

249
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,700
So? 
Get the tools, guys!

250
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,290
What is it, Chetta?

251
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,040
Who is Subin?

252
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,250
Tell me the matter. 
We're going somewhere urgently.

253
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
You may go, kiddo.

254
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,830
Show me who this lil' kiddo 
called Subin is, and then go.

255
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,330
What if it's me?

256
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,330
You guys are still carrying this item, 
which we used to carry when we were 13?

257
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,950
You..!!

258
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,620
If you come here ever again 
with such shady jobs,

259
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,160
I'll conduct the Thrisshur Pooram 
(festival) on your chests!

260
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,330
Sugri...

261
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,700
Put him in the car.

262
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,580
Good morning, sir.

263
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,500
This land belongs to 
around 35 people, sir.

264
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,950
Many are not alive.

265
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,290
Most documents are fake.

266
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,330
George sir who got murdered,

267
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,330
was really adamant that relatives of the 
dead should appear in person.

268
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:25,080
Shyam Rangan's 100 Crore township 
project got stuck due to that.

269
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,830
100 Crores!

270
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,290
So their job was done 
with a tea shop argument,

271
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,950
without giving even a 
clue to the media. Right?

272
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,620
Sir, all are benami dealings.

273
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,830
That too, an outside party.

274
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,540
We don't have any evidence to connect 
Shyam Rangan directly to this.

275
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,750
His balance-sheet is perfect, sir.

276
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Anyway...

277
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,540
Ask both of them to come.

278
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,660
Shyam Rangan and Giri.

279
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,660
Sir, Giri and boys are a closed chapter.

280
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,700
I don't think so.

281
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,330
Not that, sir. 
They don't do anything...

282
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,000
What is it, Syed? 
Sentiments?

283
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,500
Syed Ikka's deal is with Giri, right?

284
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,410
That's why even the squad didn't 
know when the guy was nabbed.

285
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,120
If the squad knew, you 
would have done a lot!

286
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,450
Sir, we got the culprit because 
Giri's guy got stuck in between.

287
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,410
Otherwise, no one will even pick up 
goat-shit in front of Shyam Rangan,

288
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,660
leave alone the culprit.

289
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,200
So even if there's 
no one in the police

290
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,620
to catch Shyam Rangan's wingman 
without his knowledge,

291
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,200
there are others.

292
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,580
Ask both of them to come.

293
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,330
Sir, Shyam Rangan is not in station.

294
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,620
His younger brother Sudeep 
Rangan is the one active here.

295
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,830
Okay. If not the head, 
ask the tail to come.

296
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,290
Sir.

297
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,330
Sir.

298
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,750
Sudeep Rangan, right?

299
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Yes, sir.

300
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,200
Where is Shyam Rangan?

301
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,290
He is in Dubai, sir.

302
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,250
I called you here to say that...

303
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,080
That 100 Crore project of yours?

304
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,870
You should stop it 
for the time being.

305
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,200
Which project, sir? 
I didn't get you.

306
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,540
Sudeep, you know what it is. 
So do the police.

307
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,290
If I ask you to stop, 
you should stop.

308
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,330
And this registrar murder case...

309
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,750
Just because someone admitted to the 
crime, the file won't be closed.

310
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,080
Everything will have a motive, right?

311
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,620
Sir...

312
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,450
We started from an 
ordinary low-base here.

313
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,910
By playing many 
games in many ways.

314
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,450
In business, we do play 
some wrong games sometimes.

315
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,620
If we are forced to play that...

316
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,450
Then...

317
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,870
the route through which you 
found our documents...

318
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,790
I'll be giving a taut reply 
to that, soon enough.

319
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,750
Tea or coffee?

320
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,950
No. Thank you.

321
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,370
Do you know where you're 
sitting now, Sudeep?

322
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,500
At Thrisshur City Police 
Commissioner's office.

323
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,540
And not at Pattalam market where your 
father Rangan used to scrap business.

324
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,080
Police is aware of all the issues 
that happened here recently.

325
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,540
For what...

326
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,830
and why.

327
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,120
But we're keeping it pending for now.

328
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,580
Till the investigation is over.

329
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,250
So till then...

330
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,330
if you go around for 
jobs here and there...

331
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
we won't be in talking 
terms thereafter.

332
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,330
Okay, sir.

333
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,080
So tell your brother when he calls...

334
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,540
No need of anymore games 
crossing the Thrisshur border.

335
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,290
Sir...

336
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,120
The scrap story you told is correct.

337
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,080
That was our base, indeed.

338
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,370
And many big brothers like 
you came here, and left.

339
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,120
Even then, we have been around.

340
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,370
Let's see, sir....

341
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,370
... whether we should be in 
talking terms hereafter, or not.

342
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,500
Are there any pending 
hearings of your cases?

343
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,370
There was an LP warrant, right?

344
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,200
There was a case in 2006.

345
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,910
I served one year for it, 
and closed it.

346
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,500
And I wasn't aware 
of such a warrant.

347
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,410
Then, I took bail for that too.

348
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,200
It's been 4 years since 
you got married, right?

349
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,250
Sit down, Giri.

350
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,700
I have a 3 year old child now.

351
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,870
I called you to say that, all that 
should continue in the same way.

352
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,160
No need of any goondaism.

353
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,450
If you've decided to reform, 
you'll have all the help from the police.

354
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,250
I know.

355
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,370
Syed Ikka has helped me a lot.

356
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Hey!

357
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,950
What sir meant was that, if you 
stay decent, good for you.

358
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,410
If you show off too much 
and get out to do jobs,

359
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,370
I'll kick and break your spine!

360
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,660
Understood?

361
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,620
Anand...

362
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,910
Relax.

363
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,830
I don't go mess with anyone, sir.

364
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,160
But if someone messes with me,

365
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,250
going back home, having food and 
sleeping, after receiving it,

366
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,040
... is not my habit!

367
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,200
If someone hits me,

368
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,540
I will also hit back!

369
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,120
I'll hit back, whoever it is.

370
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,870
I'll go to his house 
& hit him hard!

371
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Shall I leave, sir?

372
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,580
Hey! I told you, right?

373
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,000
I signed and left from there.

374
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,200
Then what's your problem?

375
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I'll come fast.

376
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,330
No.

377
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,750
I haven't forgotten.

378
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,870
No. I am at Murugan Annan's shop.

379
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,120
Let me see.

380
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,660
I'll bring it when I come.

381
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,290
There's no problem! 
Okay then.

382
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,330
Is everything okay?

383
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,830
Everything is okay.

384
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,120
Did Veni know about it?

385
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,750
Yes. That's why she's going 
on calling like this.

386
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,500
Getting into unnecessary troubles... 
- That's not the only reason for the call.

387
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,620
4 years are getting completed today since 
Giriyettan brought Chechi to his life.

388
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,700
So today's your wedding anniversary? 
- Yes.

389
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
You can say so.

390
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,160
It's been 4 years since our 
arms & legs got tied up!

391
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,700
Why? 
Are you getting bored?

392
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,950
Go and tell her then.

393
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,660
She'll thrash you & 
pin you to the wall.

394
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,290
Hey!

395
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,040
If you ever get involved 
in such shady cases,

396
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,700
I'll break your face. 
Got it?

397
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,620
Giriyetta, it's not like that.

398
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,410
It's true to that I spoke to that guy.

399
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,660
He was my senior in Model boys school.

400
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,250
When I saw him after a long time, 
I just asked how he was doing.

401
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,450
Giriyanna, the boy just 
asked him how he was.

402
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Finally he had to go sign at 
the Commissioner's office.

403
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,500
A strong tea.

404
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,410
Hey! You can have a light tea.

405
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,080
When it's time for you to drink strong tea, 
your big brothers will tell you.

406
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
You should be careful.

407
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,870
Having a family is a great fortune.

408
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,290
No matter how much life teaches us about 
its virtue, we won't realize it.

409
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,620
I realized that only when my son was 
trembling to death in my hands.

410
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,750
What's happening with 
the case, Murugan Anna?

411
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,200
What will happen 
with the case, Giri?

412
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,830
For the police, it's an accident.

413
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,830
They asked me which car hit him.

414
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,830
It was an expensive car. 
What else do I know?

415
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,700
But the face of the man 
who was driving it.

416
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,250
I will never forget that.

417
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,620
Are you gifting this snack 
for the anniversary?

418
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:25,910
'My friend'

419
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:32,120
'My companion'

420
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:55,700
'You come to me, 
like the rain during a full moon night'

421
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:02,950
'You spread more light 
than the morning'

422
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,160
'Slowly, you turned into the 
romance in my silences'

423
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:17,700
'Caressing my eyes like a dream, 
are you fading away?'

424
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:25,040
'In this path of life, 
as a flame of light'

425
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:31,870
'You are the lone musical 
note, in the song of my life'

426
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:39,080
'My friend'

427
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,370
Hey!

428
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,450
Wait.

429
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,660
Why didn't you say my name 
at the police station?

430
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,330
What you did that day 
was a major crime.

431
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,410
But he has raped a girl.

432
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,120
That too, a child who hasn't 
even reached puberty.

433
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,620
Someone who did that, 
should be killed brutally like this.

434
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,120
I liked that grit of yours.

435
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:08,200
'Oh my love, who appears in 
my memories in the night'

436
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,830
'As you clear the 
darkness within me'

437
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:23,200
'As you provide solace 
to by burning soul'

438
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:30,290
'My heart is trembling, 
unable to drift away from you'

439
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:35,370
'My friend'

440
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:43,370
'My companion'

441
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,540
What are you doing?

442
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,950
I'm washing clothes here.

443
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,580
Yeah! I'm also doing 
some laundry here.

444
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,450
Shall we meet tomorrow?

445
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,080
Why not? 
Let's meet.

446
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,330
Shall we get married?

447
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,790
Why not?

448
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,410
My parents are no more.

449
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,950
I have only my grandmother.

450
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,250
As if I have everyone!

451
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,000
I agree to this marriage.

452
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,910
But what is your job?

453
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,830
I take others to task.

454
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,580
So that's a big task, isn't it?

455
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,580
Yeah! I undertake both 
big and small tasks.

456
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,950
Well... blessings?

457
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,080
Bless you!

458
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:37,200
'Holding your hands at twilight'

459
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:44,370
'As the drop of Kumkum I 
apply on your forehead'

460
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:51,620
'As you come gradually into 
my life, like a shadow'

461
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:59,000
'My mind is intoxicated 
with this endless romance'

462
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:35,580
'You come to me, 
like the rain during a full moon night'

463
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:42,870
'You spread more light 
than the morning'

464
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:50,200
'Slowly, you turned into the 
romance in my silences'

465
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:57,500
'Caressing my eyes like a dream, 
are you fading away?'

466
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:04,660
'In this path of life, 
as a flame of light'

467
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:11,790
'You are the lone musical 
note, in the song of my life'

468
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:19,160
'My friend'

469
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:24,370
'My companion'

470
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
Veni, dear...

471
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,700
What is it, Baletta? 
You've come so early?

472
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,910
Where is he?

473
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,410
Over there, playing 
with our daughter.

474
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,410
Now, dad will shoot!

475
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,950
You're playing here?

476
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,910
Hey darling! Don't you 
have to college today?

477
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:53,910
I'm a small girl, right? Then 
how can I go to college?

478
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,790
But your tongue is like 
that of college girls.

479
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,120
Shoot him, dear.

480
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,000
Oh no! I'm dead!

481
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,000
Well, I couldn't get 
through to your phone.

482
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,660
She has thrown my phone 
somewhere.Then how...

483
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,660
Hey! Where's my phone? 
- I donâ€™t know.

484
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:14,160
Hey! Everyone in town has 
heard about the fight.

485
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,700
Many have been calling to 
rub salt into the wound.

486
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,250
People are concerned about others' 
lives more than theirs, right?

487
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,040
It's always been like that. 
- Let them call.

488
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,950
What's the status of 
the load to Koratty?

489
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,160
It went long back. 
- Is it?

490
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,450
Hey! Hold her.

491
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,330
I want to pee. 
- Mom will take you.

492
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:31,500
You want your mom only for that? 
For everything else, you want dad.

493
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,450
Or you pee on your mom, dear!

494
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,410
Did you have tea, Balettan? 
- Yes.

495
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,910
I'll take a bath & come.

496
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,830
Give another tea to Balettan. 
- Please sit.

497
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,870
Then I'll drink one more tea.

498
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,700
One can never have 
enough tea, right?

499
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,790
Stop playing on the phone. 
- Give Balettan.

500
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,540
No! No! 
I've had enough.

501
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,250
Do you want him to catch someone & 
give him to the police again, Baletta?

502
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,160
Drink it.

503
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,370
She's angry because of that issue.

504
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,330
Giri..!!

505
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,870
You should come back early today. 
- Okay.

506
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:16,950
It's her mom's training.

507
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,290
Drink the milk, dear.

508
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,830
Why do you have a long face? 
- It's nothing.

509
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,870
There won't be any problem regarding that. 
I told you, right?

510
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,290
There's no problem, dear. 
Smile!

511
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,080
Smile, dear!

512
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,750
Show your crooked teeth & smile.

513
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,580
Balettan is here.

514
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,750
Then how did we have 
that little one?

515
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,370
Did we buy her from 
the ration shop?

516
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,200
Why has he come early?

517
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,120
The title deed writer Kabeer Ikka, 
asked not to deliver to him anymore.

518
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,160
If you don't want 
the delivery, fine!

519
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,620
Problem solved, right? 
Damn it!

520
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,950
Certain people don't 
want water delivered...

521
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:16,370
Their offices are not places for market 
goons to walk in and out of, it seems.

522
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,330
Such useless guys. 
- You shut up!

523
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,000
Can we go to a bar 
to drink tea then?

524
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,830
My dear Ali, even if I hadn't gone there to 
drink tea, he would have killed him there.

525
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:28,830
Shut up, man!

526
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:33,290
It would be difficult to make 
the ends meet this month.

527
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,540
What to do?

528
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,200
If we do a mistake once, 
we will be scarred for life!

529
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,660
We'll continue fighting!

530
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,700
Sugri, everything 
has returned, huh?

531
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,790
No point worrying 
about that now, Kodi.

532
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,910
I think now you'll have to go hunting 
for dogs like earlier. - Get lost.

533
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,410
Hey Sugri! Come here.

534
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,370
Hey!

535
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,450
That's Podiyan, right?

536
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,370
What is he doing here?

537
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,250
Podiyan?

538
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,580
Yes! The guy who gave us a 
link to nab that guy, right?

539
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,660
Kattikornam scooters.

540
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,450
Yes. 
- Where did we get the link to that?

541
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:07,660
It's him who gave it.

542
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,660
What the hell does he want? 
Let me see.

543
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:13,120
What is it? 
- Baletta, he's in trouble.

544
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,370
He is in love with a girl.

545
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,870
Her brothers have fixed another wedding 
for her. It's a bad situation.

546
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,620
What should I do for that?

547
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,580
My uncle has a house in Rajakkad.

548
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,080
So we need a vehicle 
to go there.

549
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,830
You should arrange it, Balettan.

550
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,200
Do I sell vehicles or what?

551
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,830
You have a relative, right? 
Arun from Pattikkadu? - Yes.

552
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,160
He runs a 'Rent A Car' business.

553
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,120
If you call him... 
- Hey! That's not possible. Get going.

554
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,830
Balettan!

555
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,330
Don't take up any new troubles!

556
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,370
Hey! It's nothing. 
These are boys I know.

557
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,500
Didn't you see? Wherever I go, 
I get into trouble.

558
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,120
In between that, you want this? 
You get going.

559
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,000
Please, Balettan. 
Don't abandon us.

560
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,700
We are helpless.

561
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,330
I'll do something. 
You go now.

562
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,330
Okay Baletta.

563
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,580
Push it inside.

564
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,580
Careful!

565
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:04,790
Okay.

566
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,330
Shanmugham... 
- Yes, sir.

567
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,160
What's happening? 
-We've packed everything.

568
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,370
Where did you keep the gold box? 
- We've marked it & kept it inside.

569
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,040
It's expensive stuff. 
Take it really carefully.

570
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,500
Okay, sir. 
- Who all are going?

571
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,620
Just us.

572
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,370
Okay. Go fast.

573
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,580
Okay. 
- Close it.

574
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:48,410
Shut up!

575
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,790
For a mood, bro!

576
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,500
Mood? 
In this forest?

577
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,200
What is this? 
What, bro?

578
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,580
Switch on the wiper.

579
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:58,910
Eggs?

580
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,040
Apply the brakes!

581
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,540
Bro!

582
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,080
Bro!

583
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,450
Bro!

584
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,450
What happened, bro?

585
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
Hey!

586
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,040
Listen to me, please.

587
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,290
Mom, the gas agency's number is 
saved as 'Agency' on your phone.

588
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,410
Call them, mom.

589
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Okay.

590
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,950
Madurai CI Dharan has 
come to see you, sir.

591
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,330
Chief Minister is passing 
through the city, right?

592
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,250
We're already late. 
- It's an urgent matter, sir.

593
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,290
Come.

594
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:39,790
Recently there was a gold robbery 
in Madurai, by a gang, sir.

595
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:41,750
When we investigated,

596
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:45,160
I got only the number plate 
of the car they used.

597
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,910
That's a Kerala registration number.

598
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,290
When we investigated with that,

599
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,330
we got an address of a guy.

600
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:53,910
I came to know that he's from 
a village near Chalakkudy.

601
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Sir, just a second.

602
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:56,830
Bring him.

603
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,750
Roughed him up badly, huh?

604
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,500
CI Dinesh sir went to get him.

605
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,580
Well, when he was showing off too much, 
I slapped him on his cheek.

606
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,410
What's next?

607
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,620
He's saying that he 
was an acting driver.

608
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,250
Is it? 
- No, sir.

609
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:13,790
I drive a car at Petta.

610
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,910
Some guys who came there said 
that they want to booze,

611
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,790
and asked me if I could 
drive them around.

612
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,950
Since I'm a driver, I 
told them I'll go.

613
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,410
After going straight to Madurai, when they 
were about to take a room in a hotel there,

614
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,750
none of them had ID proofs.

615
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,830
So I gave my license to 
let them stay there.

616
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,290
In the evening, I saw them taking 
the car and going somewhere.

617
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,160
But I don't know where 
they went or for what.

618
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,080
Next day when I checked the car, 
the back glasses were broken.

619
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,540
They asked me to go back to Thrisshur, 
get this car into a garage,

620
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,040
and come back with 
a different car.

621
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,330
I took another car and 
went and gave them, sir.

622
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,200
I don't know anything else.

623
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,750
These are all lies, sir.

624
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,500
Which garage did you drop it in?

625
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:56,370
Who is this Shiju?

626
00:50:58,950 --> 00:50:59,950
It's me.

627
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,000
Come here. 
Let me tell you something.

628
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,160
What's the matter, sir?

629
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,660
Nothing much, man. 
Get into the car.

630
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,370
We're from the Commissioner's squad.

631
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,330
Hey! Do you want some 
tender coconut juice?

632
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,000
No need, sir.

633
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,620
Have it, man! Once you go to the station, 
coconuts will be used for something else.

634
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,250
You don't want it?

635
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,040
Pack an old tender 
coconut in a cover.

636
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:33,450
Shiju, do you know him?

637
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:36,450
No, sir.

638
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:37,830
You don't know him?

639
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:41,160
Chetta, I brought a crashed Innova car 
and took a Santro and went, right?

640
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,950
It was me, Chetta.

641
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,660
Oh! That! Yes!

642
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,080
So you understood. 
Hey!

643
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,870
Whose car is it?

644
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,950
That's from the 'Rent A Car' owned 
by Arun Chettan from Pattikkadu, sir.

645
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,080
Arun Chettan's?

646
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,370
It's a case that came 
from Vettoli Balettan.

647
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,660
What happened, Giriyetta?

648
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,830
Didn't I tell you when 
I saw them itself,

649
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:26,660
not to take up any new 
unnecessary troubles?

650
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,120
And what happened now?

651
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,080
Do you have any idea about him?

652
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:32,660
I know that boy for a while now.

653
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,250
From the day I saw him, I've 
been calling him Podiyan.

654
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:42,450
But I'm still not able to believe 
that he was such a big fraud.

655
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,330
That's not the problem here.

656
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,540
How many Crores worth 
of Gold was smuggled!

657
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,410
Do you know what kind of trouble 
you've got yourselves in?

658
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,450
First we need to collect 
all details about him.

659
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,080
Balan, turn off your cell phone.

660
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:55,040
Ali, don't step out for now.

661
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,000
You are like a father to me!

662
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,580
Otherwise I'd have 
slapped you now.

663
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,700
Come, Advocate Madam.

664
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,790
Why did I even think of doing it? 
Damn it!

665
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,540
Turn off that damn thing. 
Didn't you hear what she said?

666
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:20,750
Tell me.

667
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,160
Okay bro.

668
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,620
From what you said, that 
guy's name is Binu.

669
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:34,160
There's an unfinished apartment on the 
left, after Chakkamukkal temple, right?

670
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,080
It's an area where all 
these drunkards set camp.

671
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,620
He is there.

672
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:40,450
Come!

673
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,950
What is it? 
Come on!

674
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,120
What's that?

675
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,910
To attack? 
- Why should you attack?

676
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,250
So shouldn't we attack them?

677
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,660
You guys wait here, okay?

678
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,000
I'll hold him by his 
ears and bring him here.

679
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,620
Keep it there.

680
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,000
Donkeys!

681
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,620
They've brought a sword to 
catch a puny little guy.

682
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,330
Play the card, man!

683
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,330
Hey Podiyan!

684
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,580
Balettan!

685
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,370
What's happening?

686
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,950
Shall I get you a drink?

687
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:40,330
Hey! Didn't you guys recognize Balettan? 
- Of course.

688
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:43,540
The guy who gave a sketch for me, 
to get Subin out of his colony?

689
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,160
This old man is the guy!

690
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,750
Why have you come here?

691
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,370
Have you come with a scheme 
against us now, you old man?

692
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,330
Sonny, I've played 
much bigger games,

693
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:57,870
back when your daddy was 
carrying you around as a sperm!

694
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,290
Don't mess with me.

695
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,750
Hey Podiyan! 
Come here.

696
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:07,040
What did you do with that car 
after taking it from here?

697
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,500
Now I'm as good as 
trapped, right?

698
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:13,450
If you don't go surrender 
tomorrow, I can't go back home.

699
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,540
Well, you weren't 
trapped on your own.

700
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,410
We trapped you, Balettan!

701
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:23,700
Hey! The set-up now is not shady like 
it used to be during your times...

702
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,450
... to retaliate immediately 
when someone's put in trouble.

703
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:30,080
If we are given trouble, we'll give 
it back with double the impact!

704
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,540
On a different level altogether. 
- Heard that?

705
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:35,540
Don't waste your time here.

706
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,290
Our boys will skin you alive.

707
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,200
You...!! 
- Hey!

708
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,500
Hey old man!

709
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,750
Sheesh! We brought all 
the tools in vain.

710
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:13,200
You got my 100 Crore 
township project stuck!

711
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,620
You are finished!

712
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,830
If my boy knows this...

713
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:02,410
Baletta!

714
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:04,950
Dude!

715
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,200
Etta!

716
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,580
Baletta!

717
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,660
Hey! Catch them!

718
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:43,790
Veri...!!

719
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,500
Hey! It's a trap for us!

720
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,950
Dude, come!

721
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,120
Come! Come!

722
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,080
Catch them!

723
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,450
Don't let them get away!

724
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:05,660
Run!

725
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,450
Don't leave him!

726
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,700
Come, man!

727
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,700
Veri, run!

728
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:34,830
Over there!

729
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,290
They have gone that way!

730
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:41,290
They are over there!

731
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,580
Come on!

732
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:45,580
Where are they?

733
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,700
Giriyetta...

734
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,620
Etta..

735
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,160
Where are you?

736
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,750
They are going that side. 
Come on!

737
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,370
Veri!!

738
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,000
Dude, that way!

739
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:12,790
Run!

740
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,700
Finish him off!

741
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,370
Giriyetta...

742
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:05,120
Our Balettan...

743
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,370
Those guys...

744
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,750
Those guys...

745
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:12,450
He's gone!

746
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:15,120
He's gone, Etta.

747
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,200
Kodi..!!

748
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:37,790
Take him to the hospital.

749
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,200
Come on!

750
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:46,910
Dude, Veri!

751
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,540
Veri!!

752
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,120
Veri!!

753
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,040
Veri!!

754
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:16,450
Veri!!

755
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:28,830
You..!!

756
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,120
Come!

757
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:53,410
See!

758
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,410
Sir, it's high grade stuff. 
Its influx has increased now.

759
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:03,750
Whose building is this?

760
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,450
Sir, there are 5 
partners who own this.

761
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,540
They have filed cases 
against each other now.

762
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,330
Sir, there are many legal issues.

763
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,290
It's been lying like 
this for 4-5 years.

764
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:15,040
Come. 
- Sir.

765
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:29,370
What's the delay? 
- No delay, sir. We're taking it.

766
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,120
Load the body.

767
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,250
Get me the postmortem report ASAP. 
- Sir.

768
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:40,450
Giri...

769
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,410
Our Balettan is going.

770
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,660
Don't you want to see him?

771
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,580
Okay. 
- Sir.

772
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:19,450
Come here.

773
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,790
What happened to your face?

774
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,870
He fell down while playing football, sir.

775
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,620
Let's go.

776
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,790
Did she sleep? 
- Yes.

777
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,080
Why don't we bring 
Balettan's daughter here.

778
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,080
She is alone there, right?

779
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:06,250
Let the rituals get over there.

780
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:07,500
We'll bring her after that.

781
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,870
Why did you guys get 
drenched in the rain?

782
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,290
We were in Balettan's house. 
- Get them towels.

783
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:28,540
You go inside.

784
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,120
- Chechi, did your daughter sleep?

785
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:35,500
He is in the city.

786
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,660
But...

787
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:41,160
should we retaliate now?

788
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:47,870
Get him some tea.

789
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,700
We can't get back 
at them so easily.

790
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:05,500
If we falter by any chance...

791
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:37,370
Sir...

792
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:39,700
How many people are there? 
- 4 people in total, sir.

793
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,200
They were planning to escape from the shop. 
The shopkeeper informed us.

794
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:45,250
But when we went there, there were 
so many crackers used to kill pigs.

795
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:47,910
Sir...

796
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:51,160
From the looks of it, it's an attack 
planned against Sudeep Rangan.

797
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:55,580
Today is the 16th day 
since Vettoli Balan died.

798
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,250
Balan and Giri had a strong 
emotional connection between them.

799
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:04,450
And there's a hint that Balan was 
framed in the Madurai gold robbery.

800
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,700
And considering Giri's usual style, 
once he decides to attack someone,

801
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:09,700
Sir... Over here.

802
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,450
A vehicle will come & stop at 3 PM.

803
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:14,120
In the meanwhile, the phone of one 
of those Bengalis would ring.

804
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,830
He'll throw the pig 
crackers at the vehicle.

805
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:18,660
Once it bursts, one more guy would 
come from the opposite side...

806
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:21,790
They must have planned to finish 
him off in between that commotion.

807
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,910
Okay! Let everything 
happen as per their plan.

808
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:28,200
We'll monitor them and 
take appropriate action.

809
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,250
All right, sir.

810
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,790
Kumar, if the attack is against 
Sudeep Rangan, be extra careful.

811
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,160
See to it that he's not killed.

812
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,620
That's enough to start a gang war.

813
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:39,700
And keep it confidential.

814
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,580
Anand needn't know this now. 
- Sure, sir.

815
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:55,370
Wait.

816
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,700
Hey! This has accounts 
of only 85 cases.

817
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:00,250
85? 
Just a minute.

818
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,790
Why have you come here, sir?

819
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,160
Nothing.

820
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,290
When I was passing through this route, 
I thought I'll see your set-up, Giri.

821
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:24,580
Good.

822
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:26,500
How many staff do you have?

823
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:27,950
Around 15 people.

824
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,450
You can't enter wearing shoes.

825
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:36,330
Okay. 
No problem.

826
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:38,950
Where's the water source from?

827
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:40,450
That's...

828
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:43,410
Cut that call.

829
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,910
There are three wells here, 
that don't dry up.

830
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:50,080
That's our daily bread now.

831
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,120
Good.

832
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,950
Is your supply only in Thrisshur?

833
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,580
Take it. 
Seems like some important call.

834
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,080
What is it?

835
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,660
We rang his phone.

836
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:09,950
Nothing is bursting!

837
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,290
I'll see what it is, 
and call you.

838
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:14,830
You wait there.

839
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,750
What did you ask, sir?

840
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:20,830
Is your supply 
only in Thrisshur?

841
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:22,660
Yes. Only in the town, 
as of now.

842
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,120
Tell me!

843
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,450
Our man is here!

844
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,000
The crackers are not bursting!

845
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:38,830
Can't you go directly?

846
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,700
What? 
- Should I attack directly?

847
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,120
Of course.

848
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,200
You took them, right?

849
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,700
Get them out directly.

850
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,200
Okay then. 
I'll do it directly.

851
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,540
To unload...

852
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,290
To unload the water jar...

853
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:55,700
Water jar, huh?

854
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:00,750
I gave you hard cash without 
taking any document!

855
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,500
Start the car!

856
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,660
You...!!

857
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,410
I'll get back at you later.

858
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:17,450
Let's go!

859
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,330
Start the car, dude. 
They're going to attack us!

860
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:21,620
Go! Go!

861
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,000
Stop there, you!

862
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:26,910
Come on, guys!

863
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Come on!

864
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,080
Hello!

865
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,750
Sir, that attack was missed. 
Should we follow them?

866
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,120
Not required.

867
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,330
Giri is in front of me.

868
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,700
Yeah.

869
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:46,700
Sudhi, call your big brother, 
and tell him the matter.

870
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,750
Get lost!

871
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,660
Dude, we were attacked at Thrisshur fort.

872
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:51,700
That too, at our fort!

873
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,500
If they can come and attack us there, they 
can attack us anywhere in Thrisshur town.

874
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,500
Can you shut up?

875
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:57,540
Speed up the car, man!

876
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,870
Stop! Turn right! 
It's them!

877
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:03,120
Turn right!

878
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:09,000
Hey! Let's change this car. 
They know this car.

879
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,410
Don't speak nonsense. 
- Dude, it's risky.

880
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,120
I know them. 
Listen to me.

881
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:17,370
Stop! Stop!

882
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:19,950
Come on! Fast!

883
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,580
Get in!

884
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,410
In this? 
- Sudhi, listen to me!

885
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:25,580
Sudhi, get in! 
You take that car and leave!

886
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:28,200
Go via Pallikkulam. 
Rest I'll tell you.

887
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,750
Yes, Kumar. 
- Sir, is Giri in your custody?

888
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,750
No. I left.

889
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,790
But don't worry. 
He couldn't do anything.

890
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:38,830
I was with him.

891
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:41,910
Sir, there are many guys who 
work for him in the town.

892
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:44,500
He normally tries to make 
an attempt with them first.

893
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,120
To intimidate the guy who's 
going to be attacked.

894
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,410
What do you mean? - The sketch would 
come from a different route, sir.

895
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:52,200
He won't make the 
boys do that anyway.

896
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:54,950
He'll do it face to face.

897
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,290
Face to face.

898
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,950
Sudhi, please listen to me. 
- Can you please shut up?

899
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:12,160
If my brother knows that such a 
puny gang tried to attack me...

900
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:14,080
I'll be slapped by him first.

901
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:23,290
Okay. 
I'll call him.

902
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:25,620
You don't have to lose your 
peace of mind because of that.

903
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,620
Hello! 
- Oh! He's very busy. Sorry.

904
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,250
What? 
- Please call him later. - No!

905
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,080
I'm his brother. 
I need to talk to him urgently.

906
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,120
Okay, wait.

907
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,120
What?

908
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:44,290
Hello?

909
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:46,830
I was asked to wait!

910
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:52,370
There's a call for you.

911
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:54,540
Tell me, Sudhi.

912
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,200
You are finished!

913
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,790
If my boy knows this...

914
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:32,700
There is no hope, sir.

915
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,370
If you give us a consent,

916
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:36,290
we can remove him 
from the ventilator.

917
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:38,620
No.

918
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,750
I'll tell you.

919
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:58,120
Shyametta, Giri & team are planning to 
surrender at the court directly tomorrow.

920
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:01,410
We've found the place where they are today. 
Shall we attack?

921
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:04,870
No.

922
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:10,370
Shyam...

923
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:12,790
Giri is like this in all his cases.

924
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:14,580
He appears directly 
before the court.

925
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:17,910
Once everything cools down, 
Advocate Rajalakshmy gets him bail.

926
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:23,080
Let him finish playing 
his game, Advocate.

927
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,120
Your Honour...

928
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:14,410
This Giri's vehicle crashed on to the 
auto rickshaw Sudeep was travelling in,

929
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:16,870
in broad daylight, 
while the public was watching.

930
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:18,870
Objection, Your Honour.

931
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:22,700
There's a correction in what the 
Respected Prosecutor is saying.

932
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,540
He didn't crash into it.

933
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:26,330
He hit the auto 
rickshaw by accident.

934
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:31,000
Moreover, my client did not escape 
without stopping his vehicle.

935
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,250
As soon as the accident happened, 
he got out of his vehicle,

936
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:36,870
he went close to him, 
and tried to help him.

937
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:40,540
Objection, Your Honour. 
This Sudeep Rangan is in a coma now.

938
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:43,410
The reason is not a blow to 
the head, caused due to the accident.

939
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:46,950
Instead, there's a witness statement 
that his head was smashed strongly.

940
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,580
Respected Court should grant me 
permission to examine the eye-witness.

941
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,660
Permission granted. 
- Thank you, Your Honour.

942
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:55,000
First witness, 
Chandran, Kunnathu House.

943
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:11,540
Witness.

944
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:21,950
What's your name? 
- Chandran, Kunnathu House.

945
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:24,330
What's your job? 
- Selling duck eggs on wholesale.

946
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:25,910
Supplying it to shops.

947
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,160
You had given a statement 
to the police that,

948
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:33,000
you saw this Giri smashing 
the head of Sudeep Rangan,

949
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,540
who was injured and lying in the 
auto rickshaw, after the accident.

950
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:38,910
Isn't he the person 
whom you saw that day?

951
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,700
Isn't he?

952
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:47,870
Say it.

953
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,620
I saw him going towards him. 
- Then?

954
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,040
Go ahead. 
Say it.

955
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:57,540
But what if he had gone close to 
save him, like the Advocate said?

956
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:58,910
Huh?

957
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,040
Well, what if he had 
gone there to save him?

958
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,500
It must be, sir.

959
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,200
Must be to save him. - What about 
the statement you gave the police?

960
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:12,200
Sir, I had a couple of drinks 
on the way back home from work.

961
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:13,330
I was high.

962
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,120
When policemen asked me, I 
blabbered something hastily.

963
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:19,620
I don't know anything else.

964
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:30,290
My client Giri doesn't have any personal 
grudge against Sudeep Rangan, Your Honour.

965
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:34,200
This was an accident that 
happened unknowingly.

966
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:38,120
By examining the evidence, the Honourable 
Court will be convinced about it.

967
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,040
Under the circumstance that even the 
witness statements are not clear,

968
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:46,500
I humbly request the Honourable 
Court to grant bail to my client.

969
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:47,830
Thank you, Your Honour.

970
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:53,370
Considering the lack of evidence and 
questionable witness statements,

971
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:55,410
the Court grants 
bail to the accused.

972
01:20:57,370 --> 01:21:01,410
But the Court cannot overlook the past 
criminal background of the accused.

973
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,410
So, the Court orders the City Police 
Commissioner to conduct a proper investigation,

974
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:06,660
and submit a report.

975
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,700
Until the investigation is completed,

976
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:11,870
the accused should appear and sign 
before the City Police Commissioner,

977
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:14,120
every week hereafter. 
Bail is granted under this condition.

978
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,290
I'll tell you.

979
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:21,290
I'm outside. 
- Go ahead, sir. I'll come.

980
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:26,830
What happened? 
She didn't come?

981
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
No. 
Her PSC exam is today, right?

982
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:31,080
She wasn't planning to go initially.

983
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:32,950
Advocate Madam compelled her to go.

984
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:35,830
How are things?

985
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,790
It's okay, Giriyetta. 
Collections have gone down a bit.

986
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:38,830
But it's still okay.

987
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:42,410
We should go to the 
Commissioner's office, to sign.

988
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:48,410
Didn't you settle this guy? 
- Long back, but he's not going!

989
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,750
Hey! Can you let me also join your team?

990
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:52,660
What's wrong with you?

991
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,870
Him and his damn meeting.

992
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,830
Sir... 
- You carry on.

993
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:09,410
What is it?

994
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,000
To meet the 
Commissioner & sign...

995
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,330
You're not in a hurry, right?

996
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,290
Planning to kill more people with 
your car after leaving?

997
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,120
Wait there.

998
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,500
Couldn't you call and tell me earlier? 
Come.

999
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,330
I can understand the 
frustration of the police.

1000
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,160
But you shouldn't vent it by making 
people wait at the office verandah.

1001
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,580
There's a value to everyone's 
time, Commissioner.

1002
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:36,910
The job of the police is not to check 
the value of random criminals' time.

1003
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:39,870
You may sit. 
Anand, give that register.

1004
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,580
After settling the 
witness in advance...

1005
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,250
the arguments were 
superb in the Court.

1006
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:51,330
I liked that.

1007
01:23:51,410 --> 01:23:52,410
Thank you.

1008
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,000
If someone chops you 
up on the road,

1009
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,160
the police will have to come, 
to pick up your remains!

1010
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,330
If you are careful, 
good for you.

1011
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:06,660
Sir, I was living very carefully 
with my wife and child.

1012
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,540
Sir, in my life,

1013
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,700
the only things I 
can call my own,

1014
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:14,870
are some really close 
relationships.

1015
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,370
If someone destroys that,

1016
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,500
I won't stand watching silently.

1017
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:41,910
What happened?

1018
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,620
Isn't it ringing?

1019
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:52,790
It's switched off.

1020
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,040
Not going through.

1021
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:57,080
Her exam wouldn't be over yet.

1022
01:24:58,410 --> 01:24:59,540
Go fast.

1023
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,620
Didn't she reach? 
- No.

1024
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:19,250
She had told me that she'd be 
late since she has the PSC exam.

1025
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,290
But I didn't think that 
she would be so late.

1026
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:22,870
That's why I called you, sir.

1027
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:29,620
Okay then.

1028
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:46,790
Chetta...

1029
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:48,370
What is it, Sugri? 
- Is the exam over?

1030
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:50,160
They've all left after the exam.

1031
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:52,200
How long has it been? 
- It was over at 1 PM.

1032
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,870
What happened? 
- Nothing.

1033
01:25:57,790 --> 01:25:59,580
Everyone left by 1 PM.

1034
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,120
Yes, Madam.

1035
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,120
Giri...

1036
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,330
Go behind the indoor stadium.

1037
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,200
Syed will come there.

1038
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:28,830
What is it, Syed Ikka?

1039
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:30,870
There's a small issue? 
- What issue?

1040
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:32,700
Veni is missing.

1041
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:35,040
As soon as I got 
this information,

1042
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,620
I checked the CCTV visuals of all 
shops next to school junction,

1043
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,200
where the PSC exam happened. 
Look.

1044
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,370
It was a chain-snatching attempt.

1045
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:48,910
These visuals have only captured 
Veni running behind them.

1046
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:50,540
She has gone missing from here.

1047
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,290
Look! This vehicle...

1048
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:57,120
belongs to Keeri Shameer from 
Diwanjimoola railway colony.

1049
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:06,120
I checked the CCTV visuals 
of all shops nearby...

1050
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,830
but Veni can't be 
seen in any of that.

1051
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:14,120
Take her to Advocate Madam's house.

1052
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:18,330
Start the car!

1053
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:20,410
Giri!!

1054
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:43,580
You..!!

1055
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:47,450
Stop!

1056
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,290
Come here, you..!!

1057
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:17,080
Sugreevan, don't show 
off too much over here!

1058
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,250
Sreedharan...

1059
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:24,000
ask your boys to 
escape from here!

1060
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,040
I don't consider the size of the place 
I go to, before getting down to work.

1061
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:28,080
Got it? Move!

1062
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,160
Whoever you may be, 
we don't care a damn!

1063
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:32,540
Get lost, you...!!

1064
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,250
Move! 
Place him here!

1065
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:36,830
Tell us!

1066
01:28:58,330 --> 01:29:00,750
I don't want you or the chain 
that you snatched.

1067
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:03,700
Where is she?

1068
01:29:04,410 --> 01:29:06,250
We took one road to 
snatch the chain.

1069
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:09,290
Bye.

1070
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,870
Hey! Hey!

1071
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:22,540
She ran behind us.

1072
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:25,370
When we went on to a by-lane,

1073
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,290
a traveller van 
came and took her!

1074
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:31,620
Hey!

1075
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:40,950
They were planning to kidnap her, 
where there were no CCTVs or people.

1076
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,200
it was a sketch!

1077
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:47,620
From whom?

1078
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:49,580
Say it!

1079
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:52,370
Pandaykkal Shomy.

1080
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:54,540
Sudheer, you have to work 
here in the future too.

1081
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,450
We can discuss the matter.

1082
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:59,200
Don't show off too much with 
the cars in between that!

1083
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:03,450
You...!!

1084
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,620
Hey! None of you move!

1085
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,040
If you even take a step forward...

1086
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:16,040
you'll go limping from here. 
You heard me?

1087
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,580
Bloody..!!

1088
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:18,750
Hop on to your bikes.

1089
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:20,870
You..!!

1090
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:27,950
I need you to give me two answers.

1091
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:29,750
One.

1092
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:31,620
My girl whom you kidnapped today.

1093
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:34,040
Is she alive now?

1094
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:37,620
If she is, where is she?

1095
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,250
It was a sketch.

1096
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,790
It's been a few days 
since we noted her.

1097
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,000
It was a quotation!

1098
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:55,580
You are really fast, Giri.

1099
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:57,250
Let him go!

1100
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:59,200
He doesn't have much role in this.

1101
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:01,660
This is a hide & seek 
game that I designed!

1102
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:02,830
You do one thing.

1103
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:05,500
Come to Jai Hind market at 6 PM.

1104
01:32:05,870 --> 01:32:07,910
I will return your girl over there!

1105
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:37,500
You..!!

1106
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,080
Move away!

1107
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:48,120
Hello! 
- This is Shyam Rangan.

1108
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:49,790
Aren't you happy?

1109
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:52,200
The one you attacked, 
not knowing his full might,

1110
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:53,540
was my brother!

1111
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:56,000
I have only started 
my game against you!

1112
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:59,000
That company where you fill 
cattle-feed water?

1113
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,500
Go there quickly.

1114
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:15,450
Giriyetta...

1115
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:40,750
Giri...

1116
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:42,080
I'm taking this jeep.

1117
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,120
Kodi, park that vehicle there.

1118
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,120
Sugri...

1119
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:53,330
What is it?

1120
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:56,580
They destroyed our plant. 
I cant let that go.

1121
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:57,790
Is this like that?

1122
01:38:58,450 --> 01:39:00,500
If we had a sister...

1123
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:02,450
Veni would be much 
above that position.

1124
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:05,450
However mighty he may be...

1125
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:08,120
I will enter his house and kill him!

1126
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:13,290
If it hurt you so much, 
since you see her as a sister...

1127
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:17,330
what about this heart, where she 
rests her head every night?

1128
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,870
Don't do anything now.

1129
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:24,160
She can't bear another shock.

1130
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:28,120
Ali.. Go.

1131
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:25,580
Everything is gone, right?

1132
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,830
Once, when I was 
playing in childhood,

1133
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:36,450
many ants came to that place.

1134
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:39,540
I would be killing 
each one of the ants.

1135
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:42,450
Suddenly my father 
came and asked me...

1136
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,080
'What are you doing?'

1137
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:48,910
I told him that many ants were 
troubling me when I was playing.

1138
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:54,160
Do you know what was the 
reply my father gave me?

1139
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,580
'The ants have a reason to come there'

1140
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,370
'You have sugar with you'

1141
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:04,040
'Either get rid of the sugar'

1142
01:41:04,910 --> 01:41:07,910
'Otherwise, wherever the ants came from...

1143
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:11,830
you should find that place, 
go there and kill them'.

1144
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:18,950
Kill them!

1145
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:32,200
Teja Haq.

1146
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,500
He is Shyam Rangan's close buddy.

1147
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:36,290
He's fully into illegal businesses.

1148
01:41:36,410 --> 01:41:37,790
Drugs and gold.

1149
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:40,750
And to hide all this, a 
pharmaceutical company too.

1150
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:44,410
If the information we got is true,

1151
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:48,040
a huge load of gold has started from 
Hyderabad, including that of Chettiyar's.

1152
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:51,750
He is in Coimbatore now to plan the 
movement of that gold consignment.

1153
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:56,450
The one sitting on his right is 
BMC party state secretary's son.

1154
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:59,250
And on his right, is the son in 
law of the Commissioner here.

1155
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:00,660
Should you catch him from 
here itself, Giriyetta?

1156
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:05,700
Come on, ya!

1157
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,040
I'll just come.

1158
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:11,080
Hey! Enjoy, guys!

1159
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,500
Come, girls.

1160
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:13,620
Come on!

1161
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:16,160
You enjoy, man!

1162
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:25,410
Yeah, dude. 
I'm in Coimbatore.

1163
01:42:25,910 --> 01:42:26,950
No!

1164
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,790
Just two. 
That's all.

1165
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,160
Lift him up!

1166
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:30,370
The hit job against you won't 
be like what I gave your girl!

1167
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:32,450
You heard me? 
You b@$@%@!!

1168
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:38,500
You..!!

1169
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:48,750
Buddy!

1170
01:44:56,750 --> 01:44:57,750
- If you touch me...

1171
01:44:58,410 --> 01:44:59,410
Lift him up!

1172
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,160
You bloody!!

1173
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:14,160
So how are we going 
to go about this?

1174
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:18,950
Hey! - Get lost! 
- My phone!

1175
01:45:20,830 --> 01:45:22,330
If that call gets missed...

1176
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:23,790
Cut the call.

1177
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,040
If it gets missed?

1178
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:28,660
Start typing...

1179
01:45:29,410 --> 01:45:31,160
No calls. 
Only messages.

1180
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:33,160
Him and his damn face-unlock.

1181
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:35,790
Hey! Kiddo!

1182
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,250
Look here!

1183
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:38,870
Look here, I say!

1184
01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:41,040
No! No!

1185
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:47,410
The reply has come.

1186
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:51,330
It has left from 
Hyderabad at 10.30 AM.

1187
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:56,580
What's your reply for that?

1188
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:00,830
Will you say it...

1189
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:02,790
or should I make you say it?

1190
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:06,080
Kodi...

1191
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,790
Do you know what this is?

1192
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,700
If we make you sit on this...

1193
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:22,250
It's not like we don't know how to chop off 
the head of the guy who touched our sister!

1194
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:24,790
Say it, man!

1195
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:26,410
What's the game?

1196
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,500
Done!

1197
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:34,580
Deal!

1198
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:35,750
Waiting.

1199
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:37,040
Type it.

1200
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:44,200
So how's the game?

1201
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:48,250
It was the gold that didn't 
get clearance at Vizag port,

1202
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:50,950
which Shyam cleared 
using fake documents.

1203
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:58,500
It was sold in a deal to the wholesale gold 
dealers in Thrisshur, for a cheap rate.

1204
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:00,540
By cheap, you mean how much?

1205
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:03,950
Total 100 Crores.

1206
01:47:05,410 --> 01:47:07,200
So what are the arrangements 
in the vehicle?

1207
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:10,540
A container that has full GPS tracking.

1208
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:14,450
In that, a Nipah Virus ambulance.

1209
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:20,040
Hyderabad-Vellore-Chennai... 
Then it turns from the Highway...

1210
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:23,080
to Krishnagiri, and then Bhavani...

1211
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:25,870
via Mettur dam...

1212
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,660
near Avinashi. 
There, it will be handed over to my team.

1213
01:47:35,290 --> 01:47:36,620
Type it. 
Done!

1214
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:39,870
Deal!

1215
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:44,410
Waiting!

1216
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:14,830
Aren't you guys ready?

1217
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:16,410
Ready, bro.

1218
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:17,790
We can see the truck.

1219
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:21,620
Okay?

1220
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:32,330
Come!

1221
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:43,290
What's that sound?

1222
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:50,290
That was just a jerk.

1223
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:52,450
It's nothing.

1224
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:54,160
Sugri...

1225
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,450
Oh no! 
Giriyetta!

1226
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:33,120
Hold on!

1227
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:34,370
Climb up!

1228
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:40,700
Hold this.

1229
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:49,120
Hold!

1230
01:49:49,410 --> 01:49:50,410
Come on!

1231
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:52,200
Giri! Giri!

1232
01:49:57,450 --> 01:49:58,450
Take it closer!

1233
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:11,580
Catch it!

1234
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:15,870
Give me your hand!

1235
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:18,080
Climb up!

1236
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,250
Do you know how many Crores 
that gold was worth?

1237
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:14,870
You guys...

1238
01:51:17,250 --> 01:51:18,250
Hello!

1239
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:20,830
This is Pullu Giri.

1240
01:51:21,790 --> 01:51:24,540
You have your phone in hand, 
so early in the morning?

1241
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:26,040
Tell me what it is!

1242
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:28,700
Your best buddy! 
Teja!

1243
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,290
I took him!

1244
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:34,120
Do you know whom 
you're messing with?

1245
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:38,040
I'm playing this game, knowing 
who you are, very well!

1246
01:51:38,870 --> 01:51:40,410
The gold that you packed & sent!

1247
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:44,950
Isn't your heart still beating 
faster, because you lost it?

1248
01:51:46,830 --> 01:51:47,910
I was the one who took it!

1249
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:50,620
You dog! 
You are finished!

1250
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:54,410
I've just started from one side.

1251
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:56,500
And these hide & seek games...

1252
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:58,700
I've never done that!

1253
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:03,450
Your gold will cross Valayar 
tomorrow morning at 11 AM.

1254
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:07,080
It will reach Thrisshur 
town around 2 PM.

1255
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:09,200
Try stopping it if you can!

1256
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:12,040
Only then this game would 
become interesting!

1257
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:32,580
Advocate... Call Anand, who's in the squad.

1258
01:52:33,410 --> 01:52:36,870
Tell him that the gold will reach Thrisshur 
town within 2 PM. - But Shyam...

1259
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,700
If we miss it in Valayar, 
we should catch it in Kuthiran...

1260
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:41,830
Everything is set there, right? 
- Yes.

1261
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:44,370
If we miss it there too...

1262
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:45,950
Anand, from the police 
should catch it.

1263
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:47,000
He shouldn't get it!

1264
01:52:48,450 --> 01:52:50,000
Let this get over.

1265
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,660
I will burn him alive after that!

1266
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:07,370
Kodi, slowly! 
It's not to slice him...

1267
01:54:07,410 --> 01:54:09,000
but to let him loose.

1268
01:54:53,950 --> 01:54:57,080
Sir, like we suspected, the team who 
came in that Qualis car did it.

1269
01:54:57,410 --> 01:54:58,700
We've questioned everyone.

1270
01:54:58,910 --> 01:55:02,620
They're repeating about the 
same team from Mangalore.

1271
01:55:03,370 --> 01:55:04,370
There's an information.

1272
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:05,660
Some gold smuggling.

1273
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:08,660
If I could get permission 
for a combing...

1274
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:10,700
Is it genuine information?

1275
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:12,120
Yes, sir.

1276
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:13,830
Okay, go ahead.

1277
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:15,040
Sir.

1278
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:32,750
Get down. 
- Open the boot.

1279
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:48,870
Go! 
Go fast! Come on!

1280
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,160
Ask them to stop it.

1281
01:56:05,370 --> 01:56:06,370
Yes, that one.

1282
01:56:06,410 --> 01:56:08,910
Sir, it's an ambulance. 
- So what? Ask them to stop.

1283
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:10,950
Over here. 
- Pull over.

1284
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,120
To this side. 
- Check it.

1285
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:14,700
What is it?

1286
01:56:14,750 --> 01:56:17,290
Sir, it's a Nipah... 
- Nipah! Damn it! Open the back door.

1287
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:22,330
Check it. 
- Check it yourself, sir. It's Nipah!

1288
01:56:24,580 --> 01:56:25,580
Open it.

1289
01:56:27,580 --> 01:56:28,580
Open that too!

1290
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,830
Why are you dancing around? 
Open it!

1291
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:39,080
Nipah, right?

1292
01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:41,040
Open those boxes.

1293
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:43,330
Sir, a bus.

1294
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:44,540
Stop! Stop!

1295
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:49,040
It's a bus, right? 
Let it go.

1296
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:50,500
Let the bus go. 
- Go, man!

1297
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:51,500
Open that.

1298
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:53,160
Sir, we don't have the 
rights to open it.

1299
01:56:53,330 --> 01:56:54,620
We're not supposed to open it.

1300
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:56,120
Without safety measures, 
it's risky, sir.

1301
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:57,500
No, sir. 
It's Nipah.

1302
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:59,120
You'll die for sure.

1303
01:57:03,250 --> 01:57:04,870
Do one thing. 
Park the van on the side.

1304
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:06,700
Come on!

1305
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:09,000
Close it and park it.

1306
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,080
Didn't you check it?

1307
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:14,950
Go! Go!

1308
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:20,250
Stop it! 
Get inside and check it.

1309
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:23,620
Get inside and check. 
Remove the seats and check!

1310
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:26,160
Sir, the entire by-pass 
road is blocked.

1311
01:57:29,330 --> 01:57:32,290
Why? - A KSRTC bus went through 
the wrong side of the road.

1312
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:37,950
Where does that bus go to? 
- Where does it go to?

1313
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,750
It's a Coimbatore- 
Ernakulam super fast bus.

1314
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:41,700
It's a Coimbatore- 
Ernakulam super fast bus.

1315
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,250
Do one thing. Call the Palakkad depot, 
get the numbers of the driver & conductor,

1316
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:47,000
and ask them to stop the bus. 
- Okay, sir.

1317
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:55,950
Leave them. 
- Sir...

1318
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:58,500
Sir, we called the depot.

1319
01:57:58,950 --> 01:58:02,660
The Coimbatore-Ernakulam bus 
is still at the depot. It hasn't started.

1320
01:58:04,330 --> 01:58:05,750
So which was this 
bus that went by?

1321
01:58:06,250 --> 01:58:07,250
Let it go!

1322
01:58:07,450 --> 01:58:08,450
Come on!

1323
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:10,500
We let the bus go, 
because you asked us to, sir.

1324
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:21,830
It's a bus, right?

1325
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:23,290
Let it go!

1326
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Open that box!

1327
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:36,700
Drop it!

1328
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:39,160
Drop it, man!

1329
02:00:32,950 --> 02:00:35,040
What is it, sir? 
Have you come in search of the bus?

1330
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:38,450
I've come after knowing 
about your KSRTC smuggling.

1331
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:42,200
What's the point in saying that 
you heard the KSRTC story?

1332
02:00:42,370 --> 02:00:44,370
Witness & evidence. 
That's important, right?

1333
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:46,200
Wherever that bus is, 
over here...

1334
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:47,870
I will find it.

1335
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:50,910
Is it an antlion to bury it here?

1336
02:00:51,370 --> 02:00:52,370
You may leave now, sir.

1337
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:53,700
And gather evidence.

1338
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:55,330
We'll see after that.

1339
02:00:56,620 --> 02:00:57,750
We'll see!

1340
02:01:00,330 --> 02:01:01,330
Sir...

1341
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:05,790
You've been targetting 
me quite a lot now.

1342
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:08,370
In many ways... 
Many times...

1343
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:14,080
If you come in front of me 
to mess with me again....

1344
02:01:15,290 --> 02:01:18,540
I'll conduct the Ilanjithara 
drums festival on your chest!

1345
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:21,410
Not with drum-sticks...

1346
02:01:22,830 --> 02:01:23,830
With my leg!

1347
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:27,660
Take him away!

1348
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:45,620
Hello, brother.

1349
02:01:45,790 --> 02:01:48,750
I have taken only 
my gold from that.

1350
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:51,950
If you have any tension, my boys will 
help you take it across the border.

1351
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,870
No, brother. 
I'll handle it from here on.

1352
02:01:54,290 --> 02:01:55,450
I won't forget this.

1353
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:56,790
See you.

1354
02:02:36,750 --> 02:02:38,950
Will the rains ruin the 
Thrissur Pooram this time, Giri?

1355
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:42,620
However much it rains, Lord Vadakkumnathan 
will make the Pooram happen.

1356
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:49,160
I didn't want to create 
a scene at the station.

1357
02:02:49,410 --> 02:02:50,790
That's why I said 
we'll meet here.

1358
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:53,950
I had to find Chettiyar's 
gold from it.

1359
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:55,620
That's why it took some time.

1360
02:02:57,120 --> 02:03:00,830
And after the expense of the bus, 
the rest of the gold is in the car.

1361
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:02,330
He's my guy.

1362
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:03,870
He will bring it to the station.

1363
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:05,620
Thank you.

1364
02:03:06,450 --> 02:03:08,120
I can understand 
your feelings, Giri.

1365
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:11,120
But if we reopen closed chapters,

1366
02:03:11,830 --> 02:03:13,410
then there won't be 
a recovery, Giri.

1367
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,040
Teja!

1368
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:46,660
Bro!

1369
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:04,080
They...

1370
02:04:04,870 --> 02:04:05,870
Teja...

1371
02:04:08,290 --> 02:04:11,000
Doctor, are there 
any possibilities?

1372
02:04:15,290 --> 02:04:16,290
No.

1373
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:19,080
We have no idea how 
this happened.

1374
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:21,830
If someone gets rabies, there 
should be a dog-bite mark,

1375
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:23,290
at least somewhere 
on the body, right?

1376
02:04:23,330 --> 02:04:25,540
Otherwise, he should have 
mingled closely with a dog.

1377
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,540
We didn't get any such indications.

1378
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:29,080
Hey! Hey!

1379
02:04:30,870 --> 02:04:33,620
When Giri caught me that day...

1380
02:04:33,870 --> 02:04:37,160
when I said that he let me free...

1381
02:04:37,370 --> 02:04:39,290
you were also surprised.

1382
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:41,750
That day...

1383
02:04:42,790 --> 02:04:47,000
He made only this cut on me.

1384
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:48,200
Hey! No! No!

1385
02:04:48,450 --> 02:04:51,000
For an external rabies infection, 
sunlight won't be favourable.

1386
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:53,120
It becomes active only in 
a very low temperature.

1387
02:04:53,330 --> 02:04:57,950
That day, they took out 
the sword to free me,

1388
02:05:00,370 --> 02:05:02,500
from an ice-carrier vehicle.

1389
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:05,870
I could hear...

1390
02:05:07,330 --> 02:05:11,080
the growling of a dog inside that.

1391
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:22,250
Shyam!

1392
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:24,200
That Giri...

1393
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:27,790
Don't spare him!

1394
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:32,080
Don't spare him!

1395
02:05:33,370 --> 02:05:34,370
Shyam!

1396
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:36,830
You should finish him!

1397
02:06:00,580 --> 02:06:01,580
Giriyetta...

1398
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:05,160
Giriyetta...

1399
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:09,910
What is it? 
Is there any problem?

1400
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:11,660
Why did you want to meet me?

1401
02:06:13,410 --> 02:06:14,620
This is Soumya.

1402
02:06:18,450 --> 02:06:19,580
I know this girl.

1403
02:06:19,660 --> 02:06:22,370
I am the daughter of Sabu, 
who runs a shop at the market.

1404
02:06:22,830 --> 02:06:25,290
Sabu's elder daughter? 
- Yes.

1405
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:29,250
Giriyetta, we've been in 
love for a while now.

1406
02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:32,000
Her family fixed her wedding.

1407
02:06:33,370 --> 02:06:35,540
Then why are you here? 
Can't you come home?

1408
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:38,580
Paul, the son of Joseph 
ettan from Ancheri?

1409
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:42,540
He saw her at the Church, liked her, 
and proposed marriage to her family.

1410
02:06:42,870 --> 02:06:44,790
And her father fixed it.

1411
02:06:50,620 --> 02:06:53,120
You're already in trouble 
because of me.

1412
02:06:54,910 --> 02:06:58,330
I didn't want this to be a hassle for you, 
when you're staying away from everything.

1413
02:06:58,620 --> 02:07:00,250
That's why I didn't 
tell you anything.

1414
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:06,620
What is it, Giriyetta?

1415
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:09,500
Nothing.

1416
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:12,830
That Paul is a messed up guy.

1417
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:16,500
If he finds us, 
he will finish us off, Giriyetta.

1418
02:07:19,700 --> 02:07:21,450
You go. 
I'll take care.

1419
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:23,040
Giriyetta.. 
- Get going, man!

1420
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:25,870
Come.

1421
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:37,120
Hey!

1422
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:42,700
Take the car.

1423
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:44,870
Giriyetta...

1424
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:46,620
Take it.

1425
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Come, let's go.

1426
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:50,790
Come. 
Get inside.

1427
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:53,040
Fast.

1428
02:14:17,620 --> 02:14:18,620
Sorry Giriyetta...

1429
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:21,410
That guy gave me a lot of money!

1430
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:26,540
I didn't have any other go.

1431
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:28,790
I also have to live, right Giriyetta?

1432
02:15:10,660 --> 02:15:11,660
Finish him.

1433
02:15:23,950 --> 02:15:26,620
After getting the gold 
taking all that trouble,

1434
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:29,040
you want to play a good Samaritan?

1435
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:30,370
and give it all to the police?

1436
02:15:30,830 --> 02:15:34,870
Then why were we with you 
in your gang for so long?

1437
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:39,290
Why did you make me 
do this, Giriyetta?

1438
02:16:45,540 --> 02:16:46,870
Is the room ready? 
- Yes, sir.

1439
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:50,040
Tell me if you need anything. 
I'll be at the guest house.

1440
02:17:02,040 --> 02:17:03,040
Come.

1441
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:21,750
I'll take a bath and come.

1442
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:23,750
Okay. 
That's a good idea.

1443
02:17:36,750 --> 02:17:38,540
I'll go have a small 
drink and come.

1444
02:19:17,410 --> 02:19:18,410
No!

1445
02:19:26,830 --> 02:19:27,830
No!

1446
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:29,040
No!

1447
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:37,410
Oops!

1448
02:19:37,450 --> 02:19:39,080
I forgot to tell Giriyettan something.

1449
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:41,200
Don't get down, Soumya. Sit here. 
I'll be right back.

1450
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:22,620
Shyam, don't mind me being frank.

1451
02:21:22,620 --> 02:21:24,950
How many days has it been since 
you promised to deliver the gold?

1452
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:30,290
We jumped into this to get gold at a 
lower rate, since business is low now.

1453
02:21:30,330 --> 02:21:32,950
I settled the full payment 
by borrowing money from everywhere!

1454
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:35,910
What's the point in wasting time, 
giving random reasons?

1455
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:37,330
Gold or cash.

1456
02:21:37,370 --> 02:21:39,120
When will we get it? 
Say that.

1457
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:40,120
Well... 
- What?

1458
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:42,750
Our consignment is 
already in transit.

1459
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:44,290
What damn consignment?

1460
02:21:44,410 --> 02:21:46,160
We also stay in this 
Thrisshur town.

1461
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:48,080
It's been one week since the 
police seized the gold.

1462
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:50,000
Consignment, it seems. 
Damn it!

1463
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,790
One minute. 
- This is not right.

1464
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:53,500
Pauly, please calm down. 
- Hello!

1465
02:21:56,580 --> 02:21:59,580
Shyam, we're not joking. 
You should give us a proper date.

1466
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:02,540
Shyam, Giri is not dead.

1467
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:11,870
Within 3 days...

1468
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:14,910
Gold or cash...

1469
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:16,660
I'll bring it to a 
place that you fix!

1470
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:18,700
We can talk after that!

1471
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:58,120
Shyam, what you got that day 
was a golden opportunity to kill Giri.

1472
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:02,290
You shouldn't have left that place, 
without making sure that he was dead.

1473
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:05,580
Now even the Commissioner 
is in his favour.

1474
02:23:05,950 --> 02:23:08,200
I heard that the one who stabbed Giri, 
was killed.

1475
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:10,330
His boys are really furious!

1476
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:11,870
Let's stay low for now.

1477
02:23:12,790 --> 02:23:14,410
We lost one consignment already.

1478
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:16,660
Don't forget about 
the one in transit.

1479
02:23:17,450 --> 02:23:19,870
Well, if we have to refund the cash,

1480
02:23:19,910 --> 02:23:22,200
we won't be able to bear it, 
in our present condition.

1481
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:23,790
So what are you saying?

1482
02:23:24,040 --> 02:23:26,330
Should I run & hide, 
scared of these earthworms?

1483
02:23:26,370 --> 02:23:27,370
It's not that, Shyam!

1484
02:23:28,370 --> 02:23:29,660
A compromise.

1485
02:23:31,540 --> 02:23:33,080
The rest can wait 
until I finish him.

1486
02:23:33,290 --> 02:23:37,700
We have no idea what all Teja 
has blurted out to them.

1487
02:23:41,790 --> 02:23:42,790
Shyam...

1488
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:45,790
We don't have time to waste, 
thinking about what we lost or got.

1489
02:23:47,080 --> 02:23:48,580
An issue shouldn't happen now.

1490
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:52,870
I will talk to Advocate Rajalakshmy.

1491
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:57,700
If he causes trouble again, 
we can dispense him off like goat-shit.

1492
02:24:04,750 --> 02:24:06,250
We should finish him off, Advocate!

1493
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:51,500
So... how are things?

1494
02:25:53,750 --> 02:25:55,620
I'm not really 
interested in this talk.

1495
02:25:55,910 --> 02:25:57,540
Don't create an issue 
out of this now.

1496
02:25:57,540 --> 02:26:00,370
You both should shake hands, 
and go your own ways, in good terms.

1497
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:03,120
Why not?

1498
02:26:03,750 --> 02:26:04,910
Before that,

1499
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:06,830
shall we have some tea?

1500
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:12,330
A local tea.

1501
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:15,250
It all started...

1502
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:17,250
with a tea, right?

1503
02:26:17,790 --> 02:26:19,000
Let it end with that too.

1504
02:26:21,290 --> 02:26:22,290
Okay.

1505
02:26:25,250 --> 02:26:26,250
Murugan Anna!

1506
02:26:27,250 --> 02:26:28,250
Tea for everyone.

1507
02:26:48,870 --> 02:26:51,120
Give it to them. 
They are our guests, right?

1508
02:27:05,910 --> 02:27:07,040
What is this?

1509
02:27:08,580 --> 02:27:09,580
No!

1510
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,790
He bought a pen-knife for 5 
Rupees from Jai Hind market...

1511
02:27:50,790 --> 02:27:53,160
and stabbed it into your gut, 
and turned it four times!

1512
02:27:57,540 --> 02:28:01,290
The intestines in your stomach would 
have become like a garland now.

1513
02:28:14,910 --> 02:28:16,750
Before you die...

1514
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:21,870
try to remember which 
seed you sowed,

1515
02:28:22,950 --> 02:28:24,200
has been harvested now.

1516
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:44,370
Son!

1517
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:46,080
My son!

1518
02:29:34,330 --> 02:29:35,830
Giri... 
- I'll be there for you.
