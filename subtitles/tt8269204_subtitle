00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:18,489
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

5
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:22,391
Where are they hiding?

6
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,266
Fatty! Out!
- No!

7
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:33,310
I sat in a corner and was eating.

8
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,778
How did you find me, Sita?
- I didn't see you, I heard you.

9
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,737
Heard me? How?

10
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:41,345
I could hear from there that
you are eating Janthikalu (Andhra snacks).

11
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:44,070
No!

12
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,143
Sravya! Out!

13
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:49,347
Leave me and go
and find your brother-in-law.

14
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:50,489
He's too smart!

15
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:53,455
He's not smart!
I'm smart!

16
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,943
For whom?
- Shh!

17
00:01:58,172 --> 00:01:59,638
For brother-in-law.

18
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:06,691
Thanks, grandmother.

19
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,481
Grandmother helped her
son-in-law to win...

20
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:12,485
...the game of hide and seek...

21
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:15,866
...and made him happy.
Though it is a small scene...

22
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:18,763
...it has etched a deep memory
in grandson's heart.

23
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:21,320
Also after 20 years...

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,339
...how would it be if the grandson makes
them realise the family values...

25
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:29,223
...and help his grandmother win
and make her happy?

26
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:31,570
The only house...

27
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,177
...which we can call
our house happily...

28
00:02:35,257 --> 00:02:37,135
...it is this house.

29
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:40,442
'Grandmother's house'.

30
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:43,522
Brother-in-law,
you know what happened recently?

31
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:44,972
My wife came to me and asked...

32
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:47,289
...what do you call a person in English,
who's lucky.

33
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:48,148
What did you say?

34
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:49,968
I said they call him as 'unmarried'.

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,890
Next?

36
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:56,291
I went to the dentist.

37
00:02:58,318 --> 00:02:59,772
Daddy!
- Hey!

38
00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:02,653
Stop your jokes, brother.
Have coffee, brother-in-law.

39
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:05,753
God has given the good fortune
to laugh only to humans.

40
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,944
Let us use it.

41
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:08,708
How are you, brother-in-law?
- I'm fine.

42
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,158
She inquired about brother-in-law now,
and next...

43
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:14,066
...she will ask where we can buy gold
at cheap rates.

44
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,692
Brother, you reminded me well.

45
00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:18,383
Brother-in-law, you said you have
a friend in Dubai, right?

46
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:21,053
I think you should tell him
and get a golden biscuit.

47
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,576
I'll definitely tell.
- Okay.

48
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:25,107
Hello, brother-in-law. When have you come?
- Hi Ravi.

49
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:28,633
Hey, nice T-shirt.
- Elder brother bought it.

50
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,942
Brother-in-law, it was loose like a kurta
when I bought in the shop.

51
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:33,908
It became tight like a vest
after bringing it home.

52
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:35,282
That's why I gave it to him.

53
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,889
Brother-in-law, I've an urgent work,
I'll meet you later.

54
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,213
Going for movie with Vasu?

55
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:43,675
Take care of my brother.
- Go and enjoy.

56
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:50,914
Why do you do it slowly? Make it fast.
- Okay, sir.

57
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:55,929
Sometimes it is raw
and sometimes fully grown.

58
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,343
Don't know what one should do
to make a person tell truth.

59
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:02,931
Stop it!

60
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,820
Sons-in-law come home for festivals.

61
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:11,690
But my father says it is a festival
whenever son-in-law comes home.

62
00:04:12,423 --> 00:04:15,389
Is doctor great?
I'm tractor.

63
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:18,595
He gives stitches, I do ploughing.

64
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:21,664
I will also become a big businessman...

65
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:24,446
...if I go to the city with money.

66
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,125
Wow!

67
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:32,782
Dear...

68
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:36,514
What is this?
- Coffee.

69
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,266
Do you have any sense?

70
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:40,842
Did you hide it in order to save it?

71
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:44,049
How can I drink coffee
after eating sweets?

72
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,202
Like washing face
after applying powder.

73
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:50,897
Useless woman!
- Father, mother is not giving me Boost.

74
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:54,034
Is it, dear?

75
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:59,497
Buffalo is mine,
milk is mine and fields are mine.

76
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:00,905
What do you lose?

77
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:04,065
Will you not give Boost to my daughter?
- I'll give right away.

78
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:12,790
So until we express our anger,
people don't speak their minds.

79
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:15,024
Strange world!

80
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:17,498
You're like your father!

81
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:19,181
Father!

82
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,894
It'll be good
if it stay together like this.

83
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:24,599
What does it mean?
- Unity! Strength!

84
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:27,301
My God!
Your grandson has taken after you.

85
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:31,823
Crap!
- But for making others laugh...

86
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:36,187
You don't feel shy.
- Eat brother-in-law.

87
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,856
You should stand first in everything.
- Dear...

88
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:48,925
Elder son wants to talk to you
about something. - What is it?

89
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:51,364
Not something new,
it's the same like before.

90
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:53,231
It is about distributing property.

91
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,253
Don't expect a new reply
every time you ask.

92
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,382
Ask something different if you want.

93
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:01,497
What is there to talk
other than property?

94
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:05,745
From the time I asked you
to distribute the property...

95
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:08,848
...four of my friends went to city,
built their houses and have settled well.

96
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:10,325
But I...

97
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:14,172
...didn't achieve anything till now.
- Elder son.

98
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,172
House is not built with walls.

99
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:19,658
House is built with
people staying together.

100
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:23,253
Fields are not for division,
they need to be cultivated.

101
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:26,550
Suryarao, tell about your son.

102
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:28,464
Tell outsiders to enter the house...

103
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:30,523
...but tell them not to interfere
in family matters.

104
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:33,134
What are you talking?
- Leave it, sir.

105
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:34,863
Brother-in-law,
don't mind for interfering.

106
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:37,462
According to me,
father-in-law is right.

107
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,214
What right?

108
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:42,787
Though I've a daughter of marriageable age,
entire village still calls me his son.

109
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:45,867
Moreover I have to serve the guests
and look after their needs.

110
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,943
My life has become a supervisor.

111
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:57,809
Everyone will go in different ways
if I distribute the property.

112
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:00,867
Yes, people like you...

113
00:07:00,947 --> 00:07:04,611
...know only to have children but...

114
00:07:04,828 --> 00:07:08,962
...don't know to distribute property
and make them owners.

115
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,587
Today it should be decided...

116
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,584
...whether you want to continue
to dominate or distribute property?

117
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:19,325
Elder son wants to go to the city
and make progress.

118
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:21,867
Distribute the property.

119
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:25,073
Okay, tell your opinions too.

120
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:28,393
Come on tell, you like it, right?

121
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:32,195
I agree with father's decision.

122
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:33,821
You tell.

123
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,233
Father, we want to start business
in Vizag.

124
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,512
We like if the property is distributed.

125
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,409
Good! What about you?

126
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:47,244
Speak up!

127
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,902
I'm against distributing
this property.

128
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:55,394
No need to listen to the opinion of
sons-in-law in this matter.

129
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:57,032
No need!

130
00:07:58,257 --> 00:07:59,654
Elder son...

131
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:03,192
Be it sons or sons-in-law,
all are same to me.

132
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:07,005
Son-in-law, you are right.

133
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:11,562
I've earned this property but...

134
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:15,260
...I don't wish to keep this property
out of selfishness.

135
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:18,134
Will I take this with me after death?

136
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:20,401
Silly boy!

137
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:24,996
I'll distribute it equally to
my three sons and two daughters.

138
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:30,664
But you will get the share in property
only if you remain a part of this family.

139
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,347
This is my final word!

140
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:36,611
So instead of leading our own lives...

141
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:39,874
...we should live here forcibly, right?

142
00:08:40,962 --> 00:08:45,427
You mean to say that
you will give food only if we starve.

143
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:49,538
Tell whether you want to give or not.

144
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:54,041
Maybe you'll take this property
with you when you die.

145
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:57,888
Brother-in-law, it is wrong
to talk like that for property.

146
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:01,110
It is wrong for son-in-law to talk between
father and son regarding their property.

147
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,304
Brother-in-law,
one should give respect...

148
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:05,961
...and keep respect.
- Whom should I respect?

149
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,564
Elder son!

150
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,775
What respect?

151
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:28,696
He shouldn't have acted
in haste like that?

152
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:31,295
You want him to be happy.

153
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:33,540
He wants to make progress.

154
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:37,257
That's the only difference!
Decision is yours! Have milk.

155
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:53,955
By talking of property distribution,
elder son has caused his death.

156
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:07,258
We're leaving.
- Where, brother?

157
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,640
You should settle everything...

158
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,220
...but how can you leave like this.

159
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:13,418
He said property belongs to those
who stay here.

160
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:17,586
I've more self-esteem
when compared to others.

161
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,849
Everyone is saying
I killed my father for property.

162
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:25,115
We can't stop villagers from talking.

163
00:10:25,195 --> 00:10:28,034
That's why I'm giving up on property
and leaving this village.

164
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,172
Brother! How can you leave
without conducting post funeral rites?

165
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:34,046
What more rituals are there
when everything is finished?

166
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm leaving.

167
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:40,622
Brother! Please stop! Don't go!

168
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:24,444
You've been waiting alone
for sons from 10 years.

169
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:26,471
For how many years
you will wait like this, madam?

170
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:30,352
Will people don't change
when times are changing?

171
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:34,459
I'll wait as long as I'm alive.

172
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:37,951
For your husband and your peace...

173
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,031
...God should come to change them.

174
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,075
Grandmother?
Mother, grandmother is calling.

175
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:06,472
Talk to her.

176
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:09,220
How are you, mother?

177
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,110
Don't know how long I'll live...

178
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,702
Why do you talk like that, mother?

179
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:15,957
Grandmother, don't feel sad.

180
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:18,282
Uncles, aunts and everyone will come.

181
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,927
That day will come, grandmother.
- If your words come true...

182
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:23,343
...then I'll take vow
to visit Annavaram.

183
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,900
Grandmother, I'll come before that.

184
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,396
No, your father will scold.

185
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:30,595
Anyway, you always have this trouble.

186
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:32,278
Okay.

187
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:35,152
Mother...
- Mother, your son-in-law will come now.

188
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:37,007
I'll call you later.
- Okay, dear. - Bye.

189
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,140
I pity grandmother.

190
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,778
She's suffering from 20 years.

191
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:45,113
Because of your age-old enmity
and anger.

192
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:50,724
Your father has not forgotten the insult
and slapping he got till today.

193
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:54,756
I too wish to meet grandmother
and see all.

194
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:56,977
Doesn't uncles want to see grandmother?

195
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:58,866
I think they don't even...

196
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:01,008
...think of grandmother.

197
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:04,271
Where are they now?

198
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:08,714
Come! Come! Peketi Baburao sir.

199
00:13:09,057 --> 00:13:10,557
A1 Contractor!

200
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:15,924
I feel so excited hearing your words.

201
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:19,416
You're giving me
this title before I get it.

202
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:21,305
Maybe you will get it.

203
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:24,019
If you get me the Port contract...

204
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:25,931
...I'll become A1 Contractor.

205
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:28,141
Everything lies in your hands.

206
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,898
It is in your hands too.
- Black or white?

207
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,340
You came to my house.

208
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:36,932
Anyway,
why do we need crores of money...

209
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:39,211
...that takes lot of time
to count and...

210
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,516
...also the currency that
flies away in wind.

211
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:44,629
See if you could sell off your fields.

212
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,678
Land?

213
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:50,892
My wife is an ardent devotee of
Pithapuram Kukkuteswara Swamy.

214
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:55,192
We're planning to settle there
after my retirement.

215
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:59,955
That's if you could get me 10 acres of
farm land in that area...

216
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:05,394
Land in Pithapuram is very expensive.

217
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:09,200
The competition
for this tender is also the same.

218
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,364
You'll stay in the farmland that
costs 10 crores, definitely.

219
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,651
If you could get me
the tender application form...

220
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,181
You...

221
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:23,202
I want to give this to you
from the beginning...

222
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:27,278
Thank you, sir.
- All the best.

223
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:31,755
Similar to asking
10 kilograms of sweets...

224
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:35,896
...the officer asked for farmland
that costs 10 crores.

225
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,724
Even the cost of sweets
have increased a lot.

226
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,964
Within 20 days find where we can
get 20 acres of farmland in Pithapuram.

227
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:49,390
He will find it,
before that you look here.

228
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,520
How are you, Mr. Bapineedu?

229
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,135
A person like you treats
his mistress better than a wife.

230
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:01,826
I don't see you at all these days.

231
00:15:01,906 --> 00:15:04,804
You're not meeting at all.
Your PA takes the calls.

232
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:06,613
Watchman throws me out
if I come to your house.

233
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:09,178
Why didn't you tell me?
- Sir...

234
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,387
Why do you trouble an elderly person?

235
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:12,876
Sorry, sir.
- Keep quiet.

236
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:14,663
You're too good at acting.

237
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:17,423
First tell me about the 10 crores
that I gave you.

238
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,091
I need an answer today,
right now.

239
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:23,823
Bapineedu...mind your words...

240
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:28,232
Words give strength to people,
you're becoming weak for talking more.

241
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:29,938
Should I tell you a story?
- What?

242
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:31,789
A person like you...

243
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:34,915
...offered milk
and egg to a hungry snake.

244
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:39,255
It had both and then bit him, he died.

245
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:42,278
What's the lesson in this?
- The snake is not loyal.

246
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,605
No. That person doesn't have sense.
- Why?

247
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:47,740
Bapineedu, snakes are bound to bite,
I'm like a snake.

248
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,805
You ran behind me like a dog
until I gave you 10 crores.

249
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,389
Because of people like you...

250
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:57,267
...loyalty is limited to dogs.

251
00:15:59,202 --> 00:16:02,065
Why do you say dog when I said snake?

252
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,779
Look, you made me to slap you
instead of talking to you.

253
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:06,267
Don't make the matter worse, Bapineedu.

254
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:07,870
This matter will get worse.

255
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,126
Oh! Will it reach the government?

256
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:11,320
No need for that.

257
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,393
Tell whoever you want to tell.
Go away.

258
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,003
I'll teach you a lesson.
- Get lost!

259
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:19,919
Sir, will he do something?

260
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,397
Him?

261
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,145
If he was intelligent
then he wouldn't have given me money.

262
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:26,211
If he's powerful
then he won't threaten me.

263
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,284
Don't think more about him.

264
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:31,341
Anyway, everyone is talking about me.

265
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:33,242
Am I actor Raogopal Rao?

266
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,586
Baby!

267
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,040
Baby!

268
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:05,100
Coming, daddy.

269
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:16,332
You should come in front of me
when I go out.

270
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:19,186
You should stand in front of me
when I come from outside.

271
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:22,667
Your father is going to become
A1 Contractor.

272
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:24,751
Really? - Yes.
- Congrats, daddy.

273
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:26,778
This is the tender form.

274
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:30,087
Keep this near God with your hands.

275
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:31,259
Okay, daddy.

276
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:35,392
When will you become
MD of Sita Constructions?

277
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,411
Just one year and I'll finish my
Civil engineering and then I'll become.

278
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,824
One should have a daughter
to become lucky in life.

279
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:45,150
One should have son
in order to learn a lesson.

280
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:58,191
Ramesh, is the target completed?
- Yes, sir.

281
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,794
What about, Vittal?
- Yes, sir.

282
00:17:59,874 --> 00:18:02,061
Ramana, you?
- Not done, sir.

283
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:04,580
What happened?
- Unable to understand customers, sir.

284
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,954
Shut up!

285
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,423
Need to change the program
based on customers' mood.

286
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:11,600
Only then you can finish your target.

287
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,925
Is it clear?
- Yes, sir. - Good.

288
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:20,452
Will sir never laugh?

289
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,949
I joined 5 years back
and had never seen him laugh.

290
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:28,277
"Beautiful stars..."

291
00:18:33,705 --> 00:18:36,155
Hot samosas for our Keerthi.

292
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:39,153
Eat. - I will not eat, mother.
I want earrings. Buy them.

293
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,916
I told you many times.

294
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:44,512
Your father is busy with office,
he'll get them.

295
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:47,970
Don't you feel bored to tell
the same thing from my childhood?

296
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:52,988
My Keerthi is angry.
My sweet child. Eat.

297
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,236
See... Now...

298
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:03,661
I think daddy has come.

299
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:13,703
What happened? Look Ramana...
- Sir...

300
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:15,787
I told you hundred times and you...

301
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:18,871
Stay on hold for a minute.
- Yes, sir.

302
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:21,837
Son, how are you classes going?
- They're fine, daddy.

303
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:24,276
Did you do your homework?
- Yes...

304
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:25,947
Yes, daddy.
- Good.

305
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:27,608
Ramana, listen carefully.

306
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:31,077
Material should reach Kolkata
by 11th morning.

307
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,439
Mummy, do they give homework
to daddy...

308
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:38,878
..like how they give to us in school?

309
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:41,386
Mother, daddy never finds time...

310
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:43,321
...to spend with us, right?

311
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:54,557
No...

312
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,825
One kilogram sugar.
One surf packet.

313
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,599
What else?
- What did you take?

314
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,249
One kilogram sugar
and small surf packet, total is 50.

315
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,501
500.

316
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:08,508
You want anything else?
- No.

317
00:20:08,737 --> 00:20:11,325
Remember again...
before you left the house...

318
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:14,342
...your wife and son
must have told you...

319
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,773
...bring milk pack and chocolate.

320
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:18,716
I mean...
- His money is lost for sure!

321
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:21,750
You sit and think
by drinking cold drink.

322
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:23,822
Bring cold drink.

323
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:27,263
Okay. - Maaza!
- Maaza! Go.

324
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:29,656
Take your Maaza.

325
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:33,308
One Rexona soap.

326
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:35,129
Just one soap for the entire family?

327
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:38,664
Three soaps for three
will keep you happy.

328
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:40,759
Is it?
- Listen...

329
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,343
Three soaps.

330
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:46,450
One small paste.
- Why small paste?

331
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,545
Take big paste,
it will last for two months.

332
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,114
It will last all our life
if we don't use it.

333
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:52,268
Mouth will also stink.

334
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:53,459
What else you want?

335
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:01,245
Tell.
- Poor man!

336
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:02,802
Give popcorn too.

337
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:05,594
What else you want?
- Nothing.

338
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:08,079
100...plus...

339
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:13,965
Including your cold drink,
it is 495 rupees. - My God!

340
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:16,278
I'll give the change.

341
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:19,457
No change...

342
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:21,266
Five star...

343
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:25,125
My God! I am finished.
- Take the cover.

344
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:28,823
Thanks.
- Do visit sometimes.

345
00:21:30,777 --> 00:21:33,296
Did I spend 500 rupees
instead of 50 rupees?

346
00:21:35,518 --> 00:21:37,785
Oh no!

347
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,394
In the name of the Father,
Son and the Holy Spirit....AMEN!

348
00:21:43,772 --> 00:21:45,054
Oh God!

349
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:47,024
What happened?

350
00:21:47,104 --> 00:21:49,108
It's crash! Our shares have gone down!

351
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:51,490
First you relax.
- How can I stay relax?

352
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,558
There are many other things
we have to share.

353
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:57,066
What else?
- What else?

354
00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:58,900
Kids!

355
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:02,473
Let's first build properties...

356
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:05,713
...and plan well
and then think of having kids.

357
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:07,568
Please understand me.

358
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:26,920
Mother! Mother!

359
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,256
What happened, mother?

360
00:22:30,356 --> 00:22:32,589
I don't want. Give him.
- You eat.

361
00:22:42,264 --> 00:22:43,959
Janaki...
- Mother...

362
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,421
How are you, mother?
- I'm fine.

363
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,698
How are you?
- Mother...

364
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:55,134
Hey... - Madam fainted
and fell down recently.

365
00:22:55,214 --> 00:22:58,283
We stayed in hospital for two days,
we came home today.

366
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:00,802
Yes.
- You go away!

367
00:23:01,008 --> 00:23:04,271
Mother! How are you now?
- Signs of body...

368
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:06,149
...to say I'm growing old.

369
00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:07,740
Mother, why are you talking like that?

370
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,255
All these years
I thought I want everyone.

371
00:23:11,804 --> 00:23:15,171
But I didn't think
what everyone wants.

372
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:19,488
That's why I decided
to distribute the property.

373
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,259
Mother, why are you acting in haste?
- With this reason...

374
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:25,637
I wish to spend few days
with you all.

375
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:29,553
I want to see sons, daughters and...

376
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:32,004
...grandchildren to my heart's content.

377
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:34,420
I called up everyone and...

378
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,141
...told them
I'm distributing the property.

379
00:23:38,714 --> 00:23:40,477
On my behalf,
at least you convince...

380
00:23:40,557 --> 00:23:43,538
...son-in-law to forget
the insult meted out to him...

381
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:47,064
...during property dispute
and bring him.

382
00:23:47,282 --> 00:23:50,809
I'll tell him, mother.
Take care of your health. Bye.

383
00:23:56,523 --> 00:23:59,488
What happened, mother?
- Grandmother is unwell.

384
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:01,205
She's talking with grief.

385
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:10,148
Mother wants to see us all,
she's telling us to come.

386
00:24:10,228 --> 00:24:11,339
You go.

387
00:24:11,643 --> 00:24:13,006
One minute, father.

388
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:14,804
What?

389
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:16,910
Father, it is not your mistake
in what happened then.

390
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:23,884
But for 20 years, grandmother
and we are facing punishment.

391
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:41,670
Father,
we get summer holidays every year.

392
00:24:43,422 --> 00:24:45,242
Our friends would visit their
grandmothers' villages.

393
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:47,544
I couldn't go.

394
00:24:48,311 --> 00:24:49,642
I used to feel very sad.

395
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,585
Father, I can go to visit grandmother
without your knowledge.

396
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:55,627
But I respect you and your words a lot.

397
00:24:56,818 --> 00:25:00,691
Father, we can't stay for long
at cousins and friends' house.

398
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:01,897
We want to come back.

399
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:06,110
But we don't feel like returning
from grandmother's village.

400
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,885
Anger should be with words,
not actions.

401
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,694
Uncle committed mistake
without knowing it.

402
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:16,468
Love should be there
in words as well as actions.

403
00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:18,552
You're committing a mistake
without knowing it, father.

404
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:24,346
Father, poor grandmother,
she got her daughter married to you.

405
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:29,448
She's begging to see her daughter once.

406
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:31,395
Please, father.

407
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,413
Yes...

408
00:25:44,158 --> 00:25:46,367
Your uncle acted in haste...

409
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,379
...and I couldn't think beyond it
for so many years.

410
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:52,516
I feel silly and bit guilty for it.

411
00:25:57,309 --> 00:25:59,484
Your uncle committed
a mistake by hitting me.

412
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,698
I'll not commit mistake by
stopping you myself.

413
00:26:05,754 --> 00:26:08,857
To your grandmother's house,
to her parents' house...

414
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,777
...myself to my in-laws house,
we can go anytime there.

415
00:26:17,503 --> 00:26:18,762
Thanks, father.

416
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:27,086
Officer asked for 20 acres
farmland in Pithapuram...

417
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:30,234
...land settlement taking place
in the same village...

418
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,722
My God! Superb! You're superb, Baburao!

419
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,959
Control! Control! Control, Baburao!

420
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:43,066
Control!

421
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:46,518
Dear...
- Yes.

422
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:48,293
Juice...
- Give.

423
00:26:50,182 --> 00:26:53,171
Anyways, I'm the eldest son...

424
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,297
...I can't avoid. Let's go to village.

425
00:26:58,072 --> 00:26:59,689
What do you say?
- Hmm.

426
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,056
What did you decide
about going to village?

427
00:27:03,136 --> 00:27:04,853
It is profitable going to the place
which gives property...

428
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:06,663
...than going to place that
gives livelihood.

429
00:27:06,743 --> 00:27:09,388
I'll get the investment
I need if we go there.

430
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:13,214
If we get the property
then we can plan kids immediately.

431
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:21,561
Sand smell! Awesome!

432
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:23,485
Stop, driver!
- Hey...

433
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:24,904
What happened?

434
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:26,986
Mother, you go,
I'll go around the village.

435
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:28,909
You remember grandmother's village,
right?

436
00:27:29,276 --> 00:27:31,302
Mother, how can I forget? You go.
- Come soon!

437
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:32,653
Start, driver.

438
00:27:39,223 --> 00:27:41,490
It'll be nice
if all fingers are held together.

439
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:44,029
What does it mean?
- Unity! Strength!

440
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:47,215
My goodness!
Your grandson has taken after you.

441
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,441
Grandfather Suryarao...

442
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:52,994
Who are you, son?

443
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,685
Hand shouldn't be like this,
all fingers should be held together.

444
00:28:00,105 --> 00:28:01,994
Your eldest grandson
has taken after you.

445
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:05,228
My goodness! Santosh! Is that you?

446
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,679
Who is he?
Looking very handsome!

447
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,782
He is our Sitamahalaxmi's grandson.
- Is it?

448
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,358
How are your parents, son?

449
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:14,560
All are fine, grandfather.

450
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,828
Did you come to see your grandmother
who is unwell?

451
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:19,917
Yes, grandfather. I'll stay in the village
till grandmother's recovers completely.

452
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:22,413
Anyway, you could see
your grandmother and...

453
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,302
...she could see you like this.

454
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:26,192
Yes, grandfather. How are you?

455
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,963
By your blessings of
your grandparents...

456
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:31,464
...I'm looking after your fields
and living happily.

457
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,006
You're going to stay for few days
so visit my house once.

458
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:35,629
Yes, grandfather.
- You'll come, right?

459
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:36,708
Yes.
- Bye, son.

460
00:28:41,368 --> 00:28:43,704
You have internet recharge?
- Yes, 4G.

461
00:28:43,784 --> 00:28:46,392
Superfast! Recharge can be done
through Paytm also.

462
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:53,262
Oh! Urgent!

463
00:28:54,694 --> 00:28:57,018
I've small work.
Will you sit in the shop?

464
00:28:57,098 --> 00:28:58,650
I'll be back soon.
- I've to go.

465
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,696
Be here, I'll return in five minutes.
- Hey!

466
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:04,582
What is this pressure?
- Strange man!

467
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:07,433
What to do?

468
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:16,665
Cigarette? No, biscuit.

469
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:23,879
Hello mister. Give newspaper.

470
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,423
Hello! You! Newspaper!

471
00:29:40,782 --> 00:29:43,301
Hello! Give newspaper!

472
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,610
Hello! That's today's newspaper.

473
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,339
Why should I care for the date?

474
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,383
You've put the table.
Don't you know to clean it?

475
00:29:57,951 --> 00:29:59,783
I did your work, be happy.

476
00:30:11,284 --> 00:30:12,521
Why are chips like this?

477
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:15,063
Are these chips?
- Ask the company owner?

478
00:30:15,143 --> 00:30:17,800
Okay. Should I pay the money to them?

479
00:30:18,498 --> 00:30:20,960
You have cigarette?
- Do you smoke?

480
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,633
No! I just inhale.

481
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:25,351
Do you have cigarette or not?

482
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:26,931
It is...

483
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,343
Are you the owner of this shop?

484
00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:32,931
Don't you know where the cigarettes are?

485
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:34,551
Hello! I'm not the owner of this shop.

486
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:36,555
Owner went out,
he told me to stay for some time.

487
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,120
Sorry.

488
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:40,803
I misunderstood you.

489
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:45,109
It's okay.
- Immediately after seeing you...

490
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,502
I knew you can't run
a roadside stall too.

491
00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:50,145
You and your over action...

492
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,393
Get up! Pay money!

493
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:52,859
Over action?

494
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:56,797
For just ten rupees! Take it.

495
00:30:56,877 --> 00:30:59,763
Who will pay for the paper? Your dad?
- My dad?

496
00:31:00,244 --> 00:31:02,825
What should I say then?
- Don't fight, sir. I'll pay for it.

497
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:06,180
You wait. Go and take. Take.

498
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:10,920
Fold it.

499
00:31:12,718 --> 00:31:14,273
I'll never meet a person like you
again in life.

500
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,097
Oh! She's an angel
and I have to meet her again?

501
00:31:18,532 --> 00:31:20,834
You've proved to be
Sitamahalaxmi's grandson.

502
00:31:20,914 --> 00:31:22,024
Bye.

503
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:24,086
Come on!

504
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:30,666
Come on!

505
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:34,147
What's this dust?
- You idiot!

506
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,876
When did you wash the pants last?

507
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:37,674
We washed them last year.
Why do you want to know?

508
00:31:37,754 --> 00:31:40,250
Idiot! It is our mistake to talk to you!

509
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,192
You think I've come prepared
to argue with you! Get lost!

510
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:45,586
Mallaiah, let's go.
- Don't mess up with me.

511
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,521
Come on!
- Hey fatty!

512
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:52,227
I don't know you.

513
00:31:52,307 --> 00:31:54,070
But how do you know they call me fatty.

514
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:57,013
You're the only one fatty guy
in Pithapuram.

515
00:31:57,093 --> 00:31:58,719
It's me. Santosh!

516
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:01,318
Did you recognize me?

517
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,540
I used to visit this village
in summer holidays in childhood.

518
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,815
We used to play together.
- Santosh? You? - Yes.

519
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:09,261
What is this work?
- Am I Vijay Mallya...

520
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:10,956
...to possess flights
and pants as many as him?

521
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,857
I wear one and other is washed.

522
00:32:12,937 --> 00:32:14,620
We buy jeans at discount.

523
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,189
Colour fades if it is washed frequently.

524
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,586
It will be torn if you do like this.

525
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:18,937
Will I keep quiet if it's torn?

526
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:20,345
We will continue with it as a fashion.

527
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:22,818
We will cut it till knee high
and call it short.

528
00:32:22,898 --> 00:32:25,314
We will cut it more
and use it as underwear.

529
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:27,089
Finally we use it as loin cloth too.

530
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:28,715
That's why take this stick...

531
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,085
...and learn this art.
- I'm very happy.

532
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,444
Why Santosh?

533
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,151
For meeting childhood friend?

534
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:36,868
No. Because he's still the same.

535
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:39,857
Stop staring.
Let's go to grandmother's house.

536
00:32:39,937 --> 00:32:41,918
Grandmother's house? Why should
we go to my grandmother now? No.

537
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:44,918
My grandmother's house. Come.
- Oh, your grandmother's house.

538
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:47,149
Guys, you carry on, I'll join later.

539
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,714
Sita! You're out! Out!

540
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:54,638
Now you should close the door.

541
00:32:55,508 --> 00:32:58,313
1. 2. 3...

542
00:32:58,497 --> 00:33:01,143
Ramana! Hello!
- Bangalore uncle?

543
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:08,700
Ramana, can you hear me?
- No, sir.

544
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:12,089
Sir, hello... - Can you hear me?
- Yes, sir. Tell me.

545
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:13,957
Uncle...
- Ramana... - Sir...

546
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:16,304
Our company should target
at least 10 members this month. - Sir.

547
00:33:16,384 --> 00:33:19,533
Convince at least 5 members
and make minimum 3 members.

548
00:33:19,613 --> 00:33:20,850
Got it?
- Yes, sir.

549
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,186
Look, follow this every month
compulsorily.

550
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:24,949
I think uncle is busy with phone.

551
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:26,781
Let's talk to him over the phone
when we see him next.

552
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:32,431
Grandmother, I like you a lot.

553
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:41,122
Sitamahalaxmi residence.
Come.

554
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:05,701
What happened?
- Paint.

555
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:08,591
Mother, your loving grandson.

556
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:11,362
Santosh.

557
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,271
Grandmother.

558
00:34:24,015 --> 00:34:25,756
Did it took so many years...

559
00:34:26,019 --> 00:34:29,179
...to visit grandmother?

560
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:31,435
How are you, grandmother?

561
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,777
You used to hide behind
my drape in childhood.

562
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:38,785
How big you have grown!
- Grandmother.

563
00:34:39,197 --> 00:34:42,254
I got the house painted as
you were coming.

564
00:34:42,437 --> 00:34:43,914
I'm being mad.

565
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,552
These colours stand
nowhere before the...

566
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:48,785
...happiness that you bring.

567
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:50,811
I think they are still wet.

568
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:52,495
It's okay, grandmother. I can wash it.

569
00:34:52,735 --> 00:34:54,567
Any jewellery will look nice
on this sari.

570
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:56,021
I bought after lot of thinking.
- Hi aunt.

571
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,002
How are you?
- I'm fine.

572
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,172
Who is he?
- My son Santosh.

573
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,092
My daughter Swarna.
- Hi brother.

574
00:35:03,172 --> 00:35:04,993
Hi sister, hi uncle.
- Hi.

575
00:35:05,497 --> 00:35:06,962
Enough of giggling. Let's go.

576
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,676
Have milk.
- Hi, aunt. How are you?

577
00:35:10,352 --> 00:35:11,852
I'm fine.

578
00:35:11,932 --> 00:35:13,497
How are you?
- I'm fine. Hey...

579
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:16,486
Your brother-in-law. Say hi.
- Hi. - Hi.

580
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:23,253
Grandmother, who is that foreign lady?

581
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:25,861
She is... - We have people to
sprinkle scent on guests at wedding...

582
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:27,991
...similarly grandmother must have
arranged for her. Yes, grandmother?

583
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:30,659
Shut up! She's is the wife of US uncle.

584
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:31,918
They had love marriage.

585
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:33,396
Come here, dear.
- Yes.

586
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:34,999
US uncle is very lucky.

587
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,281
It was good that he works in US.

588
00:35:36,361 --> 00:35:38,623
Had it been West Indies or Uganda then
uncle would have been in trouble.

589
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,499
Stop it.

590
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:40,515
Hi aunt.
- Hi.

591
00:35:40,595 --> 00:35:41,903
Sandra.
- Yes.

592
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:43,838
Hey Santosh.
- Hi uncle.

593
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:46,609
You've grown big.
What are you doing? - MBA.

594
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:49,049
That's nice.
Sandra, wanna have a word. - Okay.

595
00:35:49,129 --> 00:35:51,407
Excuse me.
- Oh God!

596
00:35:51,487 --> 00:35:53,411
Save US uncle!

597
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:54,671
Elder brother is also coming.

598
00:35:58,207 --> 00:36:01,413
Your elder uncle. He's become stout.
- Yes.

599
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:04,631
Same attitude!
He's always on high!

600
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:07,551
Be careful with the flowerpots,
you might hit them and fall down.

601
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:14,973
Mother!

602
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:23,969
Mother!

603
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:27,233
Grandmother?

604
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:29,087
Mother!

605
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:31,996
Hi daddy!

606
00:36:32,683 --> 00:36:34,378
What did you get for me?

607
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,969
You like these apples, right?

608
00:36:37,641 --> 00:36:39,936
Take this.
- Thank you, daddy.

609
00:36:40,016 --> 00:36:42,645
Is she my sister-in-law?

610
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:45,633
Brother, how are you?

611
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,580
We're alive.

612
00:36:48,738 --> 00:36:51,006
Santosh!
- Mother? - Come here.

613
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:55,667
Brother, this is my son Santosh.

614
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:58,082
Roadside stall owner
is my brother-in-law?

615
00:36:58,597 --> 00:37:00,360
What are you studying?
- MBA.

616
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,819
Everyone is studying MBA nowadays.

617
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:05,533
Where is your doctor father?
Has he come?

618
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:06,952
Uncle, he said
he has operations to perform.

619
00:37:07,032 --> 00:37:09,002
He said he'll come once they are done.
- Tell him not to come.

620
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,563
Because of your father's coming here,
we're meeting here again after 20 years.

621
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:15,586
He treats everyone's
wounds over there...

622
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,179
...but he infected us with wounds here.

623
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:19,045
Uncle, why should
we discuss things from past?

624
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:22,492
You're wonderful!
Though wounds get healed immediately...

625
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:24,347
...it will leave a scar.

626
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:27,118
We should like to hear others
but shouldn't feel like answering back.

627
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:34,125
I'm very happy that
you all have come.

628
00:37:34,915 --> 00:37:39,392
Your father has left
100 acres of fields to me.

629
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,674
5 acres of coconut grove
and this house.

630
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:50,517
As your father said,
I will divide 100 acres equally.

631
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,853
Coming to coconut grove...

632
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,224
As long as I live, it is my support.

633
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:01,602
After me, this house
and coconut grove belongs to you.

634
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:06,346
Does anyone have
any kind of objection in it?

635
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:07,806
Okay, mother.

636
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:09,643
I am okay too, mother.

637
00:38:09,846 --> 00:38:12,441
Okay for me. - So let's plan
for registration tomorrow itself.

638
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,994
What is it, brother?
We met after long time.

639
00:38:15,238 --> 00:38:16,657
Why don't we find an auspicious date...

640
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:19,048
...and do registration after few days?

641
00:38:19,128 --> 00:38:21,494
Did you start?
Just now I thought...

642
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:25,290
...that nobody is replacing
your husband's absence. Good!

643
00:38:27,553 --> 00:38:31,367
Mother, why do we need auspicious dates
for coming together and breaking up?

644
00:38:31,557 --> 00:38:33,232
Let's have registration tomorrow.

645
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:34,638
Does anyone have objection?

646
00:38:34,718 --> 00:38:36,537
Brother, do it fast.

647
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:38,054
I've lot of work in office.

648
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:40,576
True! If we do registration tomorrow...

649
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:42,458
...then everyone can go to
their houses day after tomorrow.

650
00:38:42,538 --> 00:38:43,816
Yes, brother.

651
00:38:44,378 --> 00:38:46,713
Since we're here for that
so it is better to do it first.

652
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:48,562
I'll get the documents ready.

653
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,984
Hello Ramana. - Yes, sir.
- Can you hear me? - Yes.

654
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:58,703
Your target is to book five tickets
to Bangalore in Tatkal service.

655
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:00,843
Hello? God!
I need to climb the ladder again.

656
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:04,205
Sister, we already booked tickets
for tomorrow evening flight.

657
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,699
My planning is always perfect.

658
00:39:07,118 --> 00:39:09,073
We will get down at Vizag tomorrow.

659
00:39:09,153 --> 00:39:11,530
Why are you watching with a blank face?
Let's go and book the tickets.

660
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:12,860
Come.
- Come.

661
00:39:13,777 --> 00:39:15,446
I became mother unnecessarily.

662
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,404
It would have been good
had I become property.

663
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:21,452
Everyone would have shared.

664
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,258
I thought everyone
came to see grandmother.

665
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:30,178
I didn't expect them
to be so shrewd.

666
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:33,069
Sitamma!

667
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,526
She stopped immediately after my calling.
She still respects me.

668
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:38,239
Why do you mess up?
- I didn't.

669
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:40,824
You know how I helped her in childhood...
Yes, don't you know?

670
00:39:40,904 --> 00:39:42,874
Ouch! What is that name?

671
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,555
Are you my son?
Or am I your mother?

672
00:39:46,437 --> 00:39:48,651
I thought it would be respectful
if I call as Sitamma. What happened?

673
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,392
Call me as Sita
if you want to show respect.

674
00:39:51,582 --> 00:39:54,194
But don't add prefixes and suffixes.

675
00:39:54,274 --> 00:39:56,062
Else I'll thrash you.
- Oh no!

676
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,726
Sitamma! Sita...

677
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:00,300
It seems you forgot the past.

678
00:40:00,577 --> 00:40:02,233
Since I saved you then
so you're beating me.

679
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:03,388
Else you wouldn't.
- Stop it.

680
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:05,897
You wait, I'm the hero in this scene.

681
00:40:05,977 --> 00:40:06,754
You don't talk in between.

682
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:07,894
Wait!
- Why should I wait?

683
00:40:07,974 --> 00:40:09,984
All comedians are becoming heroes.
Shouldn't I become?

684
00:40:10,064 --> 00:40:11,500
You do whatever you want.
- Oh my God! Sita!

685
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:14,019
Tell me. When did you save me?

686
00:40:14,256 --> 00:40:16,039
In summer holidays...

687
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,335
Ouch!

688
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,492
Help!

689
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:30,237
Sita! Get up!

690
00:40:33,445 --> 00:40:36,983
Though I don't know to swim,
I saved Sita's life.

691
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:38,401
I'm a very great person.

692
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:40,815
I gave you a new life, you know.

693
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,123
Ouch!

694
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:45,977
Why did you slap me when
I saved you from death? - You saved me.

695
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:48,494
But you left my lotus.
- Lotus?

696
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:50,423
Saved me?

697
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,998
Sorry, Sita.

698
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,101
I didn't know
it was you at the roadside stall...

699
00:40:55,181 --> 00:40:57,623
What were you doing if you knew?
You would have acted smart, right?

700
00:40:58,254 --> 00:41:00,733
You're lucky,
I'm leaving tomorrow.

701
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,218
Otherwise roadside stall...

702
00:41:07,957 --> 00:41:10,559
Grandmother, are you thinking it would've
been good if grandfather was here now?

703
00:41:12,648 --> 00:41:16,266
I would have wished
the same had I been happy.

704
00:41:16,618 --> 00:41:18,791
What is it, grandmother?
Your children have come.

705
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:20,216
Their children also came.

706
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:22,029
House is filled with happiness.
What more you want?

707
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:23,786
As long as you didn't come...

708
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:26,353
...I felt sad that you didn't come.

709
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:28,221
Though you came for property...

710
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:31,335
I thought you would stay
in front of me...

711
00:41:31,415 --> 00:41:33,376
...for few days happily.

712
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:36,068
They are leaving tomorrow.

713
00:41:37,313 --> 00:41:40,157
Even before the paints
on walls dried up...

714
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:44,197
Grandmother, why don't you go
and ask everyone to stay back?

715
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:48,910
When I asked everyone
to stay together earlier...

716
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:51,463
...they got separated for 20 years.

717
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,347
Will they stay back if I ask them to stay
when they are ready to leave?

718
00:41:58,806 --> 00:42:00,450
They won't stay.

719
00:42:00,722 --> 00:42:02,404
They won't stay.

720
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:20,581
Uncle...

721
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:23,028
Anyway, property division is over.

722
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:25,308
If we can stay with grandmother
for few days...

723
00:42:25,388 --> 00:42:26,326
...she'll be very happy.

724
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:29,383
We can do the registration later.

725
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:32,295
Is it dear? Nuisance!

726
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:34,294
This property is mine,
registration is mine...

727
00:42:34,374 --> 00:42:36,558
...signature is mine.
Why are you dominating in between?

728
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:38,669
You and your father are same.

729
00:42:39,328 --> 00:42:41,972
Son and father are one,
they won't allow us to share the property.

730
00:42:42,052 --> 00:42:43,287
Will you not let us share it?

731
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:50,966
Customers visit other shops
when we close the shop for one day.

732
00:42:51,046 --> 00:42:54,259
If we close the shop for many days
then they'll visit others shop in future.

733
00:42:54,586 --> 00:42:55,958
We won't stay, we'll leave.

734
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:02,246
Won't you drink?

735
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:04,638
I don't have the habit of drinking.
- You don't have the habit?

736
00:43:04,892 --> 00:43:06,275
So make it a habit from now.

737
00:43:12,103 --> 00:43:13,299
Why are you crying?

738
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:14,926
I saw grandmother crying.

739
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:17,423
Don't know why but I started crying.

740
00:43:18,735 --> 00:43:21,032
Grandmother has been waiting for us
since 20 years.

741
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:24,392
For grandmother's sake, I've to make
them stay here for at least 20 days.

742
00:43:24,472 --> 00:43:26,026
Even God can't stop them from leaving.

743
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,910
Anyway, tomorrow is the registration.
They made reservations before that.

744
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:32,148
We have to stop them at any cost.
- How?

745
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:33,740
We've to do something.

746
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,028
They said they're leaving tomorrow.
Do something quickly.

747
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,195
When will he come out?

748
00:43:50,275 --> 00:43:52,191
"Oh my dear..."

749
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:53,945
Your time is good,
shorty came out soon.

750
00:44:02,904 --> 00:44:04,615
What is this phone?

751
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:10,546
Hello Subbarao?
- Apparao sir, I couldn't arrange money.

752
00:44:11,312 --> 00:44:13,272
This world runs on money!

753
00:44:13,459 --> 00:44:14,773
Why should I look into your problems?

754
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:17,015
If you don't give my commission today
then your work will not be done.

755
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:18,275
Commission batch?

756
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,786
Your registration will not take place
today even if you give one rupee less.

757
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,862
Hang up!
- Sir! Sir!

758
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,560
Come on, come on.

759
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,899
He's coming.

760
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:34,708
Sir! Sir! Please give me lift.
- Hey! Who are you?

761
00:44:34,788 --> 00:44:37,447
I'll fall down.
- Sir, give me lift.

762
00:44:40,022 --> 00:44:41,842
Wow! I acted very well!

763
00:44:42,804 --> 00:44:43,606
Superb!

764
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,460
I did as you said.

765
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,947
I have a doubt. How will you benefit
if he breaks his hand or leg?

766
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:51,127
If his hand doesn't work
for two days...

767
00:44:51,207 --> 00:44:52,545
...registration will get postponed,
right?

768
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:54,522
My God! You're no ordinary man!

769
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:56,572
Super! Super!
- Hope everything is fine.

770
00:44:58,786 --> 00:44:59,716
Thank God!

771
00:45:01,255 --> 00:45:02,794
Everything is fine!

772
00:45:03,707 --> 00:45:05,728
His hands and legs are fine.

773
00:45:05,894 --> 00:45:07,195
Our plan seem to have flopped.

774
00:45:08,197 --> 00:45:09,996
Hope nobody has seen.

775
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:12,198
I think my Nayana is fine.

776
00:45:19,112 --> 00:45:20,640
Hand is crushed!

777
00:45:21,224 --> 00:45:22,823
You've turned lucky in the last minute.

778
00:45:23,284 --> 00:45:25,086
Let's go.
- That's good!

779
00:45:27,464 --> 00:45:29,120
Why did you stop here?
- This is Sravya's house.

780
00:45:29,261 --> 00:45:31,396
Sravya...our Sravya?
- Yes.

781
00:45:31,905 --> 00:45:33,683
Sravya! Sravya!

782
00:45:34,475 --> 00:45:37,033
I brought a guest to your house.

783
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:38,248
Didn't you recognize him?
- No.

784
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:40,867
He used to teach us math
in summer holidays.

785
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,262
Santosh.
- Santosh?

786
00:45:44,361 --> 00:45:47,440
Childhood memories are sweet, right?

787
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,069
Though memories contain grief,
they're good to remember.

788
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:51,877
Do you still like Sita?

789
00:45:52,068 --> 00:45:53,590
I like her forever.

790
00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:56,305
Registrar!
- Yes, Baburao sir.

791
00:45:56,385 --> 00:45:57,897
Are you coming?
- Yes.

792
00:45:57,977 --> 00:45:58,830
Everyone?
- Yes.

793
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,916
Should I tell what the registrar
is talking to uncle?

794
00:46:00,996 --> 00:46:02,049
How can you say?

795
00:46:02,222 --> 00:46:04,254
Though I'm weak in studies,
I'm a scholar at lip sync.

796
00:46:04,436 --> 00:46:05,750
Okay, go ahead.

797
00:46:06,927 --> 00:46:10,897
Sir, I can't do the registration,
postpone it for few days.

798
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,514
He said this.
Why?

799
00:46:12,756 --> 00:46:17,590
Because I left Sita under the auto
after hearing "Laxmi dear" song.

800
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,920
My hand got crushed like a pickle.

801
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,982
'Oh! What should we do now?'
This is what he said.

802
00:46:24,062 --> 00:46:27,493
Sir, I can't come to office for few days,
please don't mind.

803
00:46:27,573 --> 00:46:29,724
Registration is important today.

804
00:46:29,804 --> 00:46:34,297
Please sir.
- By now uncle's anger crosses all limits.

805
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:37,540
I came to office directly from hospital.
- Are you in office?

806
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:41,756
I'm leaving right away.
- I need to go home, come fast.

807
00:46:41,836 --> 00:46:43,605
We're coming.
- Have coffee.

808
00:46:43,685 --> 00:46:45,637
Forget coffee. Registrar is waiting.

809
00:46:45,717 --> 00:46:47,464
Tell everyone to start. Useless woman!

810
00:46:47,544 --> 00:46:49,076
God!

811
00:46:49,692 --> 00:46:52,340
Why are watching like that? Come.
- I think we also need to go now.

812
00:46:59,379 --> 00:47:01,530
What are these twists?
- How did he come to the office?

813
00:47:17,152 --> 00:47:18,633
Is he a southpaw?

814
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,238
He should have broken the other hand too.
- Come.

815
00:47:25,978 --> 00:47:28,632
On one hand, you turned lucky...

816
00:47:29,024 --> 00:47:31,413
...and at the same time unlucky.

817
00:47:32,627 --> 00:47:35,424
You cannot do anything now.
Registration will be done in sometime.

818
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,846
Your folks will not listen to you now,
they'll leave.

819
00:47:38,765 --> 00:47:41,619
I can't see you like that.
I feel very sad.

820
00:47:42,097 --> 00:47:44,472
I'm going, bye.
Bad time!

821
00:47:55,024 --> 00:47:57,489
Hurry up, Sandra!
Airport is in Rajahmundry.

822
00:47:57,569 --> 00:47:59,629
If we don't start now then...

823
00:47:59,709 --> 00:48:01,692
...we can't catch the flight after
finishing registration. - Oh, is it?

824
00:48:04,338 --> 00:48:06,993
Why don't you eat and go?
- No time, mother.

825
00:48:07,073 --> 00:48:08,792
We'll eat something on the way.
Bye, mother.

826
00:48:09,634 --> 00:48:11,201
Bye, aunt.

827
00:48:12,951 --> 00:48:15,974
Did you pack paste, brush,
towel and everything? - Yes, madam.

828
00:48:16,054 --> 00:48:18,465
I told you to pack pickles
and snacks. Did you do?

829
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:20,908
Yes, I'm carrying them.
- Bring them carefully.

830
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:23,696
Quick!
- She's always in a hurry.

831
00:48:27,094 --> 00:48:27,931
Mother!

832
00:48:29,044 --> 00:48:30,428
Mother!

833
00:48:37,602 --> 00:48:39,485
Mother!
- Coming, daddy.

834
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:44,999
Yes, daddy.
- Did you pack everything?

835
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:46,813
Hope you didn't forget anything?
- No daddy.

836
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,656
Shanti...

837
00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:03,850
What aunt? - Elder son like
sunnundalu (Andhra sweets) very much.

838
00:49:04,106 --> 00:49:05,836
Carry them.
- No need.

839
00:49:08,147 --> 00:49:11,786
I left all my likes in this house
when you said no to my likes.

840
00:49:12,665 --> 00:49:16,131
Though you are ready to give,
there is no space in the car.

841
00:49:16,455 --> 00:49:18,899
You come.

842
00:49:26,348 --> 00:49:28,732
Where are the children?
- They sat in the first car.

843
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:34,149
Mother, how will you come alone
after the registration?

844
00:49:34,384 --> 00:49:36,723
It's okay, I'll come with sister.

845
00:49:36,803 --> 00:49:38,259
Okay. Come.

846
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,322
Bye, aunt.

847
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,368
Is it ready?
- Yes, sir.

848
00:49:47,645 --> 00:49:48,849
Everything?
- Yes, sir.

849
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,139
Sign here.

850
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:52,812
Here? I'll do.

851
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,921
Are you registering the farm?

852
00:49:56,001 --> 00:49:57,021
Yes.

853
00:49:57,713 --> 00:49:59,761
That's great!

854
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:02,058
Forget about signatures.

855
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:04,723
First decide my matter.

856
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,424
Suryarao! What about you?

857
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,033
I'm also asking the same.
What will I get?

858
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:14,582
I've been doing farming
for you for 20 years.

859
00:50:14,662 --> 00:50:17,412
If one does farming for eight years
then the land belongs to them.

860
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:19,570
What?
- I'm not saying this.

861
00:50:19,826 --> 00:50:21,071
Law!

862
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,755
I think you know
the law better than me.

863
00:50:23,835 --> 00:50:26,794
This is the difference between
growing old and become wise.

864
00:50:26,874 --> 00:50:28,925
By the way, what do you want?
- Fields.

865
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:30,187
Is it?

866
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:32,379
Fields belong to us,
authority is ours and we are the heirs.

867
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:34,631
Why should we give you now? Crap!
- Hello!

868
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,914
I looked after this property
all these years.

869
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:39,237
You're wonderful.

870
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:42,425
I too should get my share.
- So should we...

871
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:44,047
...give our properties?

872
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,641
Get lost!
- Stop sister.

873
00:50:45,885 --> 00:50:48,088
You want money?
Tell me how much you want. - Keep it.

874
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:50,689
Keep your money inside your pocket.

875
00:50:50,769 --> 00:50:52,698
This deal won't be settled with money.

876
00:50:52,847 --> 00:50:55,294
Man! This guy is too much!
- Baburao sir. - Yes.

877
00:50:55,604 --> 00:50:57,309
I'm getting late,
I need to go home.

878
00:50:57,389 --> 00:50:59,020
One minute, sir. We're coming.
- Look!

879
00:50:59,169 --> 00:51:00,813
I don't agree with this registration.

880
00:51:02,906 --> 00:51:05,099
Settle your disputes outside.

881
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:06,693
It's nothing, sir. We're coming.

882
00:51:06,937 --> 00:51:09,982
Brother, decide fast,
we're already late.

883
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,470
How many acres you want?

884
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:14,980
This matter cannot be solved easily.
We need to sit and talk.

885
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:20,599
What shall we do now, brother?
- What is this meeting?

886
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:22,691
Damn nuisance!
- Let's go home, I'll see there.

887
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:28,452
Like losing a customer
at the last minute...

888
00:51:28,743 --> 00:51:30,701
...he came at the last minute.

889
00:51:31,317 --> 00:51:32,998
He and his smirk!

890
00:51:33,517 --> 00:51:34,977
He stopped registration in the middle.

891
00:51:35,122 --> 00:51:37,966
You wait! Brother,
what about our trip?

892
00:51:38,046 --> 00:51:39,370
Not yours and mine.

893
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:42,346
We're all heading towards settlement.
Let us now leave now.

894
00:51:42,574 --> 00:51:45,327
We'll stay for a week to ten days
and settle this matter.

895
00:51:45,407 --> 00:51:47,389
Oh my God! Week to ten days?

896
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:48,634
We don't have so much time.

897
00:51:49,215 --> 00:51:51,257
Whoever needs it, they may stay.

898
00:51:51,782 --> 00:51:53,671
Whoever thinks
it is not necessary may leave.

899
00:51:54,128 --> 00:51:55,588
How can we leave like that, brother?

900
00:51:55,781 --> 00:51:58,237
Let us decide something and leave.
- I stay nearby.

901
00:51:58,317 --> 00:52:01,046
Kakinada! You need to think.
You came all the way...

902
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:02,887
...so it is better to decide after
settling the property dispute.

903
00:52:03,794 --> 00:52:05,537
I didn't expect Suryarao to do
like this.

904
00:52:05,617 --> 00:52:06,963
Why will he not do?

905
00:52:08,201 --> 00:52:09,786
Farmer should stay in the fields.

906
00:52:10,241 --> 00:52:11,591
Servant should stay in the backyard.

907
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:14,995
If you treat everyone
with respect then...

908
00:52:15,189 --> 00:52:16,504
...result will be like this.

909
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:33,600
Happy birthday, Sita.

910
00:52:38,049 --> 00:52:39,205
Ugh!

911
00:52:44,576 --> 00:52:45,904
Roadside stall!

912
00:52:46,818 --> 00:52:48,872
You played many pranks in childhood.

913
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:51,598
I hate you.

914
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:53,889
No cheers.

915
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:58,144
How are you able to drink
in the midst of this dung smell?

916
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,707
Mouth should be fine
while drinking and not nose.

917
00:53:02,323 --> 00:53:04,530
I can tolerate any smell
but not the smell of dung.

918
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,699
Forget about it.
Time is in your favour.

919
00:53:07,878 --> 00:53:10,300
I though you will bid farewell to them
but see how they stopped.

920
00:53:10,742 --> 00:53:11,836
I've stopped them.

921
00:53:13,517 --> 00:53:15,191
What did you say?
- I've stopped them.

922
00:53:15,509 --> 00:53:17,606
Did you stop them?

923
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,578
How?

924
00:53:19,723 --> 00:53:23,217
After you left the registration office,
I was thinking what to do.

925
00:53:23,297 --> 00:53:25,044
I got an idea then.

926
00:53:25,674 --> 00:53:26,912
Grandfather...

927
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,259
Come inside, son.

928
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:32,110
What brings you here, son?

929
00:53:32,968 --> 00:53:35,092
You need to do me a favour.
- Tell me.

930
00:53:35,743 --> 00:53:37,576
Everyone stayed away
from grandmother for 20 years...

931
00:53:37,805 --> 00:53:39,673
...and now they are here when
she decided to distribute the property.

932
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,191
Before grandmother could feel
happy for them...

933
00:53:42,454 --> 00:53:44,239
...they are leaving today
after doing the registration.

934
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:47,228
Grandfather,
we need to stop them at any cost.

935
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:50,224
Nowadays old people
are sent to live in old-age homes.

936
00:53:50,703 --> 00:53:53,192
By seeing your love for grandmother...

937
00:53:53,614 --> 00:53:55,704
...I feel very happy, sir.

938
00:53:56,506 --> 00:53:58,028
Tell me what I should do, I'll do.

939
00:53:58,108 --> 00:53:59,869
You've been doing farming
for 20 years, right?

940
00:53:59,949 --> 00:54:01,386
You stop the registration
by raising this point.

941
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,977
I'll take care of the rest.
- Okay, sir.

942
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:08,914
You're super. You're a fool to
search happiness in others' joy.

943
00:54:09,566 --> 00:54:10,651
You didn't change.

944
00:54:11,016 --> 00:54:13,753
Happiness stays wherever
Santosh stays. That's it!

945
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:14,865
I'm saying this.

946
00:54:18,276 --> 00:54:21,938
Chapatti like break, tomatoes
and chicken pieces on top.

947
00:54:22,178 --> 00:54:23,829
Paratha?

948
00:54:24,586 --> 00:54:25,760
Paratha? Go away.

949
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,155
I think I'll die.
- What happened, uncle?

950
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:31,352
Santosh, your aunt
eats pizzas and burgers.

951
00:54:31,432 --> 00:54:32,616
She can't eat our food.

952
00:54:32,776 --> 00:54:34,005
I don't know what to do.

953
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:36,170
Don't worry,
we'll get them from Kakinada.

954
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:37,941
Is it possible?
- Yes.

955
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:39,559
Wow! Please look into it.

956
00:54:39,701 --> 00:54:41,139
Okay.
- Thanks, Santu.

957
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,947
Pizza house?
- Yes, sir. Tell your order.

958
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:47,253
I want a large pizza urgently.
- Tell the address, sir.

959
00:54:53,343 --> 00:54:54,459
Here!

960
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:57,273
Give it fast.

961
00:54:58,647 --> 00:55:00,125
What's the bill?
- 340.

962
00:55:01,306 --> 00:55:02,481
Paytm.

963
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,534
Paytm?
- Yes, sir.

964
00:55:05,505 --> 00:55:06,373
Done!

965
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,224
Thank you, boss.
- Thank you, sir.

966
00:55:11,123 --> 00:55:12,141
Sister, this is wonderful.

967
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:14,589
Hey! Keerthi! Stop! Stop I say.

968
00:55:14,669 --> 00:55:16,628
Why are you fighting?

969
00:55:17,471 --> 00:55:19,464
Grandmother!
- Hey! Hey!

970
00:55:19,544 --> 00:55:22,319
She's a girl.
Her ears will pain due to earlobes.

971
00:55:22,399 --> 00:55:25,070
Will her ears pain?
Grandmother, her ears are not pierced yet.

972
00:55:26,669 --> 00:55:27,898
What is it?

973
00:55:28,551 --> 00:55:30,139
Didn't you pierce her ears yet?

974
00:55:30,312 --> 00:55:32,122
Aunt, your son is very busy.

975
00:55:32,202 --> 00:55:33,217
That's why I didn't pierce them.

976
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:36,129
Okay, I'll do it.
- Super, grandmother.

977
00:55:36,273 --> 00:55:38,404
This is the first function in the house
to my beloved sister-in-law.

978
00:55:38,546 --> 00:55:40,272
Let's celebrate!
- Yes.

979
00:55:40,352 --> 00:55:41,512
Why grandmother?

980
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:45,149
It is enough if we take her to a
beauty parlour and do it with gunshot.

981
00:55:46,345 --> 00:55:49,240
Small celebrations like
these gives happiness to girls.

982
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:52,086
But now traditions are changing...

983
00:55:52,385 --> 00:55:54,333
...because of ignoring these things.

984
00:55:54,504 --> 00:55:56,292
Grandmother, not only traditions change
with people like her...

985
00:55:56,372 --> 00:55:57,476
...but they will become extinct.

986
00:55:58,279 --> 00:55:59,834
Like how we did it to you
in childhood...

987
00:55:59,914 --> 00:56:02,215
...we will invite all the neighbours...

988
00:56:02,295 --> 00:56:04,473
...and get her ears pierced by Brahmam.

989
00:56:05,182 --> 00:56:06,361
Grandmother, I've a doubt.

990
00:56:06,441 --> 00:56:08,679
Were Sita's ear pierced
with needle or syringe?

991
00:56:08,759 --> 00:56:10,257
What are you saying?

992
00:56:10,337 --> 00:56:13,031
You roadside stall owner! Go to hell!
- Okay.

993
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,679
Okay, grandmother.
Let's celebrate the function.

994
00:56:16,823 --> 00:56:18,528
We will buy the clothes
in Kalamandir store.

995
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:20,282
Okay? - Yes, yes.
- Okay for you?

996
00:56:20,362 --> 00:56:22,479
Tell me.
- Thank you, brother-in-law.

997
00:56:43,224 --> 00:56:44,824
Hi fatty!
- Sravya!

998
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:45,670
Sit.

999
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,086
Don't fear.

1000
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:51,677
Ouch!
- My sweet child!

1001
00:57:51,858 --> 00:57:54,114
Look here! It's over!

1002
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:57,430
Sita, our childhood friend Sravya.
- Hi.

1003
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,471
Do you remember?

1004
00:58:03,531 --> 00:58:04,188
Santosh?

1005
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:07,458
How are you?
- I'm fine.

1006
00:58:07,538 --> 00:58:08,355
How are you?

1007
00:59:12,227 --> 00:59:15,261
Hello! Come and bless the child.
- You go, I'll come.

1008
00:59:15,671 --> 00:59:16,312
Go.

1009
01:00:26,283 --> 01:00:28,279
Uncle, it would have been good
if you too attended the function.

1010
01:00:29,101 --> 01:00:32,972
I'm trying to get out of Suryarao's
troubles by ignoring my business.

1011
01:00:33,052 --> 01:00:34,929
But you're asking me as why
I didn't attend the function.

1012
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:36,868
Hello! Hello!

1013
01:00:36,948 --> 01:00:37,776
Sir!
- Ramana.

1014
01:00:37,856 --> 01:00:40,185
Tell me, sir.
- Registration seems to get late here.

1015
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:42,005
What about our target there?

1016
01:00:42,085 --> 01:00:43,378
Uncle...
- How can it happen, sir?

1017
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,685
Need another week, sir.
- Why is it so?

1018
01:00:45,968 --> 01:00:47,792
Boss will give us lecture.
- One minute, uncle.

1019
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:51,233
Keep the phone with you,
I'll call you again.

1020
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:52,428
Okay, sir.

1021
01:00:54,629 --> 01:00:55,754
Slowly.

1022
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,857
What is it?

1023
01:00:58,623 --> 01:01:01,005
Baby's function was held without you.

1024
01:01:02,107 --> 01:01:04,799
Function would have been more
success if you were there.

1025
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:18,625
There's a smile on your t-shirt
and not on your face, uncle.

1026
01:01:29,006 --> 01:01:30,257
Pure gold.

1027
01:01:30,665 --> 01:01:33,557
This is pure 22 carat gold.
Take it, madam.

1028
01:01:36,421 --> 01:01:37,812
I'll sleep happily now.

1029
01:01:37,999 --> 01:01:40,254
I felt it is fake gold so...

1030
01:01:40,392 --> 01:01:41,762
...I came to you in a hurry.

1031
01:01:43,222 --> 01:01:45,097
I know you'll not take money.

1032
01:01:46,051 --> 01:01:47,190
Greetings.

1033
01:01:52,065 --> 01:01:53,442
I'll pick it, grandmother.

1034
01:01:54,535 --> 01:01:58,195
Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi,
your younger daughter came...

1035
01:01:58,894 --> 01:02:01,039
...to find out whether
the gold you gave is real or not.

1036
01:02:01,655 --> 01:02:03,600
Hello. Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi.

1037
01:02:04,001 --> 01:02:06,222
Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi?
- I'm Santosh.

1038
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:07,468
I'll tell grandmother.

1039
01:02:08,222 --> 01:02:10,803
Okay, son.
- Who is it?

1040
01:02:11,522 --> 01:02:13,515
It was Mr. Brahmam.
- What did he say?

1041
01:02:14,353 --> 01:02:17,203
He called up to say
the function was very nice.

1042
01:02:17,283 --> 01:02:18,621
Oh, is it?

1043
01:02:28,724 --> 01:02:29,903
Ouch!

1044
01:02:31,786 --> 01:02:32,915
Ouch!

1045
01:02:33,745 --> 01:02:36,069
I would have broken
my teeth had I fell in front.

1046
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:39,761
Gold bangles! It would have been nice
if my mother gave two more.

1047
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:50,599
God! I lost my necklace!

1048
01:02:51,069 --> 01:02:52,348
God!

1049
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,139
What happened?

1050
01:02:56,986 --> 01:02:59,205
I lost my necklace in your house.

1051
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,635
Our workers are out in the fields.

1052
01:03:01,715 --> 01:03:03,871
We'll search it in the evening.

1053
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:09,252
You want me to die here in this stinking
dung smell till your servants return home?

1054
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,875
Aunt, necklace will be found.

1055
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,837
If anybody finds it,
they will sell it.

1056
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,754
You'll understand my pain
if you lose your gold.

1057
01:03:18,108 --> 01:03:19,885
How did it fell here?

1058
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:22,016
Last night I...

1059
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:24,046
I was not getting sleep.

1060
01:03:24,245 --> 01:03:26,724
I was walking around
for getting fresh air.

1061
01:03:28,132 --> 01:03:30,625
It fell in that dung.

1062
01:03:32,458 --> 01:03:35,244
God! I lost my necklace!

1063
01:03:36,297 --> 01:03:37,728
God!

1064
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:41,473
I became cheap as
I came to take property.

1065
01:03:41,934 --> 01:03:44,874
Nobody is worried
about my necklace.

1066
01:03:45,046 --> 01:03:48,775
Isn't there anybody
who can find my necklace?

1067
01:03:48,855 --> 01:03:50,213
God!

1068
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:52,763
I'm thinking as how to trap you.

1069
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:54,791
You're caught!

1070
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,722
Aunt, did you search here?

1071
01:03:57,855 --> 01:03:59,335
It fell in the dung.

1072
01:03:59,415 --> 01:04:01,873
Why do you ask if I searched here?
Foolish girl!

1073
01:04:01,953 --> 01:04:03,639
Aunt, I'm also asking the same.

1074
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:05,557
Search in the dung.

1075
01:04:08,006 --> 01:04:09,046
Santosh...

1076
01:04:09,586 --> 01:04:11,375
Search in the dung please...

1077
01:04:12,044 --> 01:04:14,137
Aunt...it is...smell...

1078
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,936
He's from the city.
Why do you tell him to do this work?

1079
01:04:17,108 --> 01:04:19,105
I lost my necklace in your house.

1080
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:21,381
You and your ill-fated house!

1081
01:04:24,664 --> 01:04:28,336
If this property was distributed long back
then I wouldn't have entered your house.

1082
01:04:29,846 --> 01:04:31,661
Stop crying, aunt. I'll search.

1083
01:04:34,335 --> 01:04:36,180
I'll get full entertainment now.

1084
01:04:46,387 --> 01:04:47,456
Please!

1085
01:05:15,698 --> 01:05:18,068
Did you find it?
- No, aunt.

1086
01:05:18,317 --> 01:05:20,198
Revenge range should be increased!

1087
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:22,954
Aunt, how can he find it with leg?

1088
01:05:23,034 --> 01:05:24,205
Tell him to search with hands.

1089
01:05:25,556 --> 01:05:26,846
Santosh!

1090
01:05:27,814 --> 01:05:29,657
Anyway, you have put your legs inside.

1091
01:05:29,885 --> 01:05:31,391
Search with hands.

1092
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:50,337
I can tolerate any smell
but not the smell of dung.

1093
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:58,435
Don't come out until
you find my necklace.

1094
01:05:58,515 --> 01:05:59,669
Keep searching.

1095
01:06:04,021 --> 01:06:05,529
Entertainment with bonus.

1096
01:06:05,723 --> 01:06:07,123
They made him to step into dung.

1097
01:06:09,017 --> 01:06:10,793
Aunt, it will be found.
- Look fatty...

1098
01:06:10,873 --> 01:06:12,936
Yes, grandmother.
She's a evil aunt.

1099
01:06:13,745 --> 01:06:14,702
Aunt, I didn't find it.

1100
01:06:14,782 --> 01:06:15,936
Didn't find?
- Yes.

1101
01:06:16,284 --> 01:06:17,502
My time is bad.

1102
01:06:17,889 --> 01:06:19,638
I think I had seen her face after
waking up in the morning. - Son.

1103
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,983
You go and take bath.

1104
01:06:21,232 --> 01:06:23,799
Satti, get water for his bathing.

1105
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:32,467
You seem to be feeling happy
for trapping me.

1106
01:06:34,714 --> 01:06:36,408
I know you're not listening
to the songs.

1107
01:06:39,134 --> 01:06:41,455
What are you talking?
Why will I feel happy?

1108
01:06:41,632 --> 01:06:43,877
You did it for revenge,
I did it for relationship.

1109
01:06:44,926 --> 01:06:46,692
I don't understand something.

1110
01:06:47,335 --> 01:06:48,446
Do you love me?

1111
01:06:48,526 --> 01:06:51,192
Will I love you? Ugh!

1112
01:06:52,055 --> 01:06:54,437
You're chasing me everywhere.

1113
01:06:54,517 --> 01:06:56,549
No way! You roadside stall owner!

1114
01:07:01,491 --> 01:07:03,971
Will you do anything for grandmother?

1115
01:07:04,051 --> 01:07:06,168
I'll do.
We walk on fire embers at festivals.

1116
01:07:06,287 --> 01:07:07,890
We observe fasting and stay awake.

1117
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:09,387
Do we feel sad? No.

1118
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:12,446
I'll do anything grandmother says.
I can't say how happy it makes me.

1119
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:17,265
I'll be waste if she feels sad
as long as I'm here.

1120
01:07:17,822 --> 01:07:19,727
You're not waste, you're best.

1121
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:21,468
My share is 20 acres.

1122
01:07:21,548 --> 01:07:23,097
I want to sell it and leave.

1123
01:07:23,177 --> 01:07:24,594
Tell me if there is any good customer.

1124
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:27,339
You too take good commission.
- Okay, Ravi sir.

1125
01:07:27,946 --> 01:07:31,532
But I heard the field is in dispute...

1126
01:07:31,612 --> 01:07:32,644
No, no, nothing like that.

1127
01:07:32,724 --> 01:07:34,221
It'll be settled in few days.

1128
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:36,099
My brother is dealing with it.
- Oh!

1129
01:07:36,179 --> 01:07:38,784
So, I'll inform you after finding
a good customer. Bye.

1130
01:07:38,864 --> 01:07:39,477
Okay.

1131
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:41,542
Why didn't this fatty guy come yet?

1132
01:07:41,843 --> 01:07:43,392
It would have been nice
if I had the necklace.

1133
01:07:43,472 --> 01:07:44,588
Santosh.

1134
01:07:44,734 --> 01:07:46,558
You too come.
- Where, aunt?

1135
01:07:47,027 --> 01:07:49,250
Elder uncle has arranged
a secret meeting.

1136
01:07:49,414 --> 01:07:51,557
He's arranged a secret meeting
with village elders...

1137
01:07:51,637 --> 01:07:52,646
...in Suryarao's absence.

1138
01:07:52,726 --> 01:07:54,382
If the meeting becomes successful...

1139
01:07:54,462 --> 01:07:57,393
...tomorrow morning we can do the
registration and go home by evening.

1140
01:07:57,566 --> 01:07:59,789
Secret meeting is arranged?

1141
01:08:00,045 --> 01:08:02,773
My God! What to do now?
- Santosh!

1142
01:08:03,263 --> 01:08:04,336
Why do you take tension?

1143
01:08:04,446 --> 01:08:05,831
Uncle will manage everything.

1144
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:06,958
Aunt, it is not that...

1145
01:08:07,085 --> 01:08:08,658
What is it? Listen to me.

1146
01:08:08,738 --> 01:08:10,356
Didn't I tell you that uncle
will manage everything?

1147
01:08:10,734 --> 01:08:13,529
Suryarao says we will hold a meeting.

1148
01:08:14,087 --> 01:08:18,098
If it gets settled in your presence
then it will be good.

1149
01:08:18,293 --> 01:08:19,522
That's why we all have come.

1150
01:08:19,954 --> 01:08:22,197
If you could...
- Yes.

1151
01:08:22,526 --> 01:08:24,063
I too don't like to make...

1152
01:08:24,247 --> 01:08:27,119
Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi's family members
stand as accused in village.

1153
01:08:27,276 --> 01:08:29,649
Yes.
- Shop is closed for many days.

1154
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:31,915
My sister. - Greetings.
- Greetings.

1155
01:08:31,995 --> 01:08:32,743
Sit.

1156
01:08:32,927 --> 01:08:34,931
Let's finish it now itself.
- Okay.

1157
01:08:35,115 --> 01:08:35,890
Hey.
- Yes.

1158
01:08:36,017 --> 01:08:37,793
Tell Suryarao that I called him.
- Okay, sir.

1159
01:08:37,873 --> 01:08:38,768
Go.

1160
01:08:40,512 --> 01:08:42,338
If grandfather Suryarao comes now...

1161
01:08:42,837 --> 01:08:44,990
Suryarao is doing
the farming for 20 years.

1162
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:47,071
If you take back your fields...

1163
01:08:47,151 --> 01:08:48,975
...then he's worried
about his livelihood.

1164
01:08:49,113 --> 01:08:51,936
That's why
if you give him some money...

1165
01:08:52,016 --> 01:08:52,877
...he'll stay quiet.

1166
01:08:52,957 --> 01:08:55,368
I already asked about it
at registration office.

1167
01:08:55,448 --> 01:08:56,320
He said no.

1168
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,794
That guys is really crazy.

1169
01:08:57,927 --> 01:09:00,181
Look, for every work...

1170
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,439
...it is necessary to have
a congenial atmosphere.

1171
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:03,568
Yes.

1172
01:09:04,219 --> 01:09:06,204
He's coming. He'll not say no to me.

1173
01:09:07,507 --> 01:09:09,764
It is good if you give him his share.
- Okay.

1174
01:09:10,898 --> 01:09:13,030
Give him his share?

1175
01:09:13,866 --> 01:09:15,436
I got them! Let's see.

1176
01:09:16,598 --> 01:09:17,661
Aunt...
- Yes.

1177
01:09:17,881 --> 01:09:18,803
Did you get it?

1178
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:21,928
I'm sure that Suryarao
will definitely listen to them.

1179
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:25,311
You're wearing gold
but your brain is filled with silver.

1180
01:09:26,224 --> 01:09:27,525
Why did you say like that?

1181
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:29,905
Aunt, these people belong
to the same village.

1182
01:09:30,105 --> 01:09:32,363
Did you get it?
Since they are bargaining...

1183
01:09:32,522 --> 01:09:34,368
...so they must be in Suryarao's favour.
Think about it.

1184
01:09:36,276 --> 01:09:39,239
As far as I know,
they will tell us some stories...

1185
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:41,731
...and give Suryarao one extra share.

1186
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:43,122
Is it?
- Yes.

1187
01:09:43,331 --> 01:09:44,558
What are you saying?

1188
01:09:45,967 --> 01:09:46,788
What now?

1189
01:09:47,013 --> 01:09:49,007
What do you mean by settlement?

1190
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:51,823
As much as you want.

1191
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,569
If it was a certain amount then
we would have decided it outside only.

1192
01:09:54,834 --> 01:09:56,056
Why should we come to you?

1193
01:09:56,903 --> 01:09:59,407
She's on fire!
- Why should we give him?

1194
01:09:59,687 --> 01:10:00,856
Is he doing the farming for free?

1195
01:10:02,054 --> 01:10:03,475
He paid us only the lease amount.

1196
01:10:03,606 --> 01:10:04,729
She messed up everything.

1197
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:06,726
You're talking as
if we owe him something.

1198
01:10:06,806 --> 01:10:09,203
Baburao, I'm talking in your favour.
Why is she talking like that?

1199
01:10:09,283 --> 01:10:11,917
You wait.
- Wait. - Let me talk.

1200
01:10:11,997 --> 01:10:15,281
You wait, brother. Will you discuss
with us but take share from him?

1201
01:10:16,996 --> 01:10:18,168
We're safe.

1202
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:20,196
Who doesn't know your plans? Who?

1203
01:10:20,276 --> 01:10:21,135
Shh!

1204
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:23,115
Wait!
- Are we making plans?

1205
01:10:23,195 --> 01:10:24,816
No...
- What is she talking?

1206
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:26,371
I'm talking about facts.
- Hey...

1207
01:10:26,451 --> 01:10:28,457
No...
- Enough, Baburao. Enough.

1208
01:10:28,595 --> 01:10:30,632
She is talking too much
as we're listening.

1209
01:10:30,712 --> 01:10:32,318
I thought of helping you.

1210
01:10:32,398 --> 01:10:33,502
President...

1211
01:10:33,607 --> 01:10:35,429
Hey. - Sir.
- Don't call Surya. Come back.

1212
01:10:35,509 --> 01:10:37,343
Sir, I'm at Surya's house.
- It is...

1213
01:10:37,423 --> 01:10:38,624
I'm telling you to come back.

1214
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:40,418
Sir...
- Look Baburao sir.

1215
01:10:40,628 --> 01:10:41,973
This matter should be decided
in village meeting.

1216
01:10:42,194 --> 01:10:44,362
Go.
- President...no, no...

1217
01:10:44,495 --> 01:10:45,853
Sir, sir...
- Listen to me once.

1218
01:10:45,933 --> 01:10:46,876
Leave! Leave!

1219
01:10:46,956 --> 01:10:48,458
It is enough if every house
has a woman like her.

1220
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:52,250
I'm saved!
- President! President!

1221
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:53,284
Oh!

1222
01:10:54,928 --> 01:10:56,714
We can't go now.
- What to do now, brother?

1223
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:03,076
For one week,
I cancelled all my works...

1224
01:11:03,156 --> 01:11:05,503
I went everywhere...

1225
01:11:05,613 --> 01:11:07,799
...and finally scheduled
a meeting the President.

1226
01:11:07,879 --> 01:11:10,375
It was my mistake to call you.
You messed up everything.

1227
01:11:10,874 --> 01:11:12,321
Why were you shouting like that?

1228
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,357
It's become a habit for shouting
at your husband.

1229
01:11:16,117 --> 01:11:18,029
Learn to behave well...

1230
01:11:18,109 --> 01:11:21,227
...with outsiders
and family members.

1231
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:23,866
Ugh!

1232
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:24,988
Let's go.

1233
01:11:28,109 --> 01:11:29,767
Why does he say I'm shouting
when I was talking?

1234
01:11:31,009 --> 01:11:32,122
Thanks, aunt.

1235
01:11:41,452 --> 01:11:42,575
Aunt, your pizza.

1236
01:11:43,692 --> 01:11:45,194
Thank you, Santosh.
- That's okay.

1237
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,418
I don't understand what America is.

1238
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:50,861
You went there and got married as
if he doesn't have anybody.

1239
01:11:52,598 --> 01:11:55,196
I got everyone married here.

1240
01:11:55,426 --> 01:11:57,760
But I couldn't see their marriage.

1241
01:11:57,998 --> 01:12:00,821
They must be looking great
in wedding attire.

1242
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:05,871
I don't know whether Suryarao did a good
thing by stopping the registration but...

1243
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:08,463
...he gave me happiness by making
you spend time with me.

1244
01:12:11,621 --> 01:12:13,346
Grandmother said she is very happy.

1245
01:12:13,832 --> 01:12:15,458
Thanks a lot. All this happened
because of your support.

1246
01:12:15,538 --> 01:12:16,552
Stop it, sir.

1247
01:12:16,662 --> 01:12:20,113
This is nothing when compared to
the help your grandparents did for us.

1248
01:12:20,193 --> 01:12:21,955
This is nothing compared to it.

1249
01:12:23,953 --> 01:12:28,580
I know how your grandmother is
leading a lonely life for 20 years.

1250
01:12:30,206 --> 01:12:34,007
Villagers would come to console her
but nobody could make her happy.

1251
01:12:35,037 --> 01:12:36,510
Finally you came after so many years.

1252
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:39,411
You gave her lot of happiness.

1253
01:12:39,491 --> 01:12:41,710
I've been waiting for many days.

1254
01:12:42,297 --> 01:12:43,431
Now I got you.

1255
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:53,879
This give us strength, son.

1256
01:12:58,149 --> 01:12:59,846
Roadside stall!

1257
01:13:03,618 --> 01:13:04,770
Your game is over!

1258
01:13:49,071 --> 01:13:50,191
Stop!

1259
01:13:51,347 --> 01:13:52,599
Stop there!

1260
01:13:57,442 --> 01:14:00,922
We'll have to leave this house
if you take one more step.

1261
01:14:02,078 --> 01:14:03,738
You have fooled everyone.

1262
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:11,797
We cancelled our works
and ran around registration office...

1263
01:14:12,013 --> 01:14:14,260
...and you are talking to
the person who did all this.

1264
01:14:15,578 --> 01:14:17,332
Why do you lower your head...

1265
01:14:17,482 --> 01:14:19,524
...by making us feel ashamed?
Lift your head.

1266
01:14:24,058 --> 01:14:26,443
Uncle, it is not that...
- That's true.

1267
01:14:26,665 --> 01:14:29,189
You can't expect children
to be different...

1268
01:14:29,269 --> 01:14:31,204
...from their father.

1269
01:14:32,765 --> 01:14:34,636
You and your father are same.

1270
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:38,057
You're his son.

1271
01:14:38,428 --> 01:14:40,188
Do you know what my upbringing is.

1272
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:46,029
I didn't even touch my father's ashes
after he said I won't get any property.

1273
01:14:47,186 --> 01:14:50,595
Go to some faraway place from here.

1274
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,339
Go away!

1275
01:15:08,686 --> 01:15:09,780
What is this now?

1276
01:15:28,051 --> 01:15:30,014
Though situations close
every possible door...

1277
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:32,168
...God will keep one door open.

1278
01:15:32,685 --> 01:15:35,473
But I don't think
it will happen in my case.

1279
01:15:38,272 --> 01:15:40,369
Let anything happen.
I'll tell the truth.

1280
01:15:41,698 --> 01:15:43,345
Uncle, one minute.

1281
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:51,329
Yes, uncle. I met Suryarao.

1282
01:15:51,518 --> 01:15:53,977
It's a mistake. I talked to him.

1283
01:15:54,057 --> 01:15:56,247
It's a mistake.
- No.

1284
01:15:56,486 --> 01:15:58,364
Don't talk further. Leave.

1285
01:15:59,108 --> 01:16:02,013
His story ends with this scene.

1286
01:16:04,094 --> 01:16:05,675
Leave, leave.
- Brother.

1287
01:16:07,757 --> 01:16:09,149
Everything we see is not true.

1288
01:16:09,229 --> 01:16:10,744
Everything we don't hear is not lie.

1289
01:16:10,824 --> 01:16:12,960
We've seen it from our point of view.
Think from his angle.

1290
01:16:15,082 --> 01:16:17,055
Maybe went to do compromise.

1291
01:16:20,554 --> 01:16:23,623
He too had come for property.

1292
01:16:24,542 --> 01:16:26,785
Thank God! God has opened a door.

1293
01:16:28,893 --> 01:16:32,042
Uncle, as Bangalore uncle says
I met Suryarao to make compromise.

1294
01:16:32,299 --> 01:16:34,055
You thought different things.

1295
01:16:35,488 --> 01:16:38,137
Sita saw me talking to him
but she didn't listen.

1296
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:41,272
I said uncles have lot of work,
they need to leave immediately.

1297
01:16:41,352 --> 01:16:43,636
Didn't you tell that aunt
also has work?

1298
01:16:43,716 --> 01:16:46,277
She's a big trouble.
- I told him, aunt.

1299
01:16:46,357 --> 01:16:48,515
I went to tell him
not to create fights.

1300
01:16:48,595 --> 01:16:50,915
All this happened before that.
- Then why were you feeling tension.

1301
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,608
I'm afraid of elder uncle.

1302
01:16:54,062 --> 01:16:55,716
He never talks to me
by looking at my face.

1303
01:16:55,796 --> 01:16:57,748
Today he talked to me for the first time
by looking into my eyes.

1304
01:16:58,689 --> 01:17:00,472
I was afraid he will misunderstand me.

1305
01:17:00,552 --> 01:17:03,143
Okay, what else you talked
with Suryarao?

1306
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,208
I told him not to mess up with us as he
has been a loyal servant to us for long.

1307
01:17:08,029 --> 01:17:09,867
What was Suryarao's reply?

1308
01:17:10,094 --> 01:17:11,307
He said fields are like mother to you...

1309
01:17:11,387 --> 01:17:14,192
...you can leave and go
but it is like my daughter.

1310
01:17:14,743 --> 01:17:17,478
He said he can't live without it.
- He's a foolish fellow.

1311
01:17:17,996 --> 01:17:20,072
He doesn't listen to
an experienced person like me.

1312
01:17:20,666 --> 01:17:22,450
Why will he listen to you?

1313
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:24,266
I went to do compromise but...

1314
01:17:24,346 --> 01:17:25,930
...not to make it complicated.

1315
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:31,023
Let's go, brother.

1316
01:17:31,196 --> 01:17:33,109
Thank God! They believed it.
- Aunt, it is...

1317
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:35,207
Don't know what you saw and heard.

1318
01:17:35,287 --> 01:17:37,099
She too acts in haste like me.

1319
01:17:43,383 --> 01:17:45,849
I can only see your father
every time I see you.

1320
01:17:46,998 --> 01:17:48,602
I listened to you.

1321
01:17:49,244 --> 01:17:52,504
But if I hear that you were lying...

1322
01:17:54,768 --> 01:17:56,980
Be careful!

1323
01:18:01,008 --> 01:18:03,247
The scene I saw at roadside stall...

1324
01:18:03,327 --> 01:18:06,001
...and the story he is narrating
is not in sync.

1325
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:07,690
How did he escape like that?

1326
01:18:08,663 --> 01:18:11,109
If what I saw is right
then did I hear it wrong?

1327
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:14,272
What is right and wrong?
Him or me?

1328
01:18:15,164 --> 01:18:16,867
At least you tell me.

1329
01:18:17,407 --> 01:18:19,339
He is always right!

1330
01:18:21,015 --> 01:18:22,393
What are you saying?

1331
01:18:25,394 --> 01:18:28,122
What happened, Sravya?
- Santosh...

1332
01:18:28,202 --> 01:18:29,921
Sita and fatty are drowning.

1333
01:18:40,826 --> 01:18:42,691
Sravya, why are you watching?
Press Sita's stomach.

1334
01:18:47,123 --> 01:18:48,975
Santosh, where are you going?

1335
01:18:49,285 --> 01:18:51,731
If Sita finds out that I saved her
then she will jump again.

1336
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:53,299
Whose name should I tell?

1337
01:18:56,352 --> 01:18:57,554
I got it.

1338
01:18:59,608 --> 01:19:03,649
He still remembers the friendship,
stories and...

1339
01:19:03,729 --> 01:19:05,108
...everything from his childhood.

1340
01:19:05,188 --> 01:19:08,230
Tell me the truth.
Does he love me a lot?

1341
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,473
Yes, he told me.

1342
01:19:10,827 --> 01:19:15,013
I tried to tell you this
at the recent function.

1343
01:19:15,093 --> 01:19:16,973
But you were not in a mood to listen.

1344
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:19,662
Finally I tell you something, Sita.

1345
01:19:19,742 --> 01:19:22,351
Where Santosh stays,
happiness is there.

1346
01:19:44,296 --> 01:19:47,701
Dear Sita, I like you very much.

1347
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:50,324
I wanted to tell you this
to you directly.

1348
01:19:50,404 --> 01:19:53,865
But you always hate me.

1349
01:19:53,945 --> 01:19:55,920
Forgive me if my mistake is there.

1350
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,747
I want to tell you something
through this letter.

1351
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:03,163
However you hate me,
I will always love you.

1352
01:20:03,347 --> 01:20:07,098
With love,
your brother-in-law Santosh.

1353
01:20:14,675 --> 01:20:16,178
I'm sorry, brother-in-law.

1354
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,756
Did you learn
about this word just now?

1355
01:20:20,578 --> 01:20:23,161
I've misunderstood you all these days.

1356
01:20:23,781 --> 01:20:25,762
I want to tell you something.

1357
01:20:28,581 --> 01:20:30,639
Setting your hair back...

1358
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:32,654
...shivering of lips...

1359
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:34,807
...hiding your shyness...

1360
01:20:35,585 --> 01:20:38,016
...tell these things directly
without any slow motion.

1361
01:20:39,616 --> 01:20:41,017
I love you, brother-in-law.

1362
01:20:42,981 --> 01:20:44,209
I've been waiting for this...

1363
01:20:44,289 --> 01:20:45,939
...from the time I came here.

1364
01:20:47,106 --> 01:20:48,646
But one condition.

1365
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:51,846
What? - Don't call me as
'Roadside stall' from tomorrow.

1366
01:20:51,926 --> 01:20:53,030
Okay.

1367
01:20:54,915 --> 01:20:56,705
I love you so much, brother-in-law.

1368
01:20:57,371 --> 01:20:59,317
New plan?

1369
01:20:59,542 --> 01:21:00,840
To fool me?

1370
01:21:02,422 --> 01:21:03,703
Nothing like that, brother-in-law.

1371
01:21:03,783 --> 01:21:07,526
I know your plans,
sketches and maps.

1372
01:21:08,019 --> 01:21:09,913
Look, try to fool me...

1373
01:21:09,993 --> 01:21:11,626
...but don't become one. Hold it.

1374
01:21:12,206 --> 01:21:13,762
Go away!
- Brother-in-law!

1375
01:21:17,421 --> 01:21:20,015
No! I shouldn't say 'I love you'
to brother-in-law directly.

1376
01:21:20,344 --> 01:21:21,460
He will think it as screenplay.

1377
01:21:22,056 --> 01:21:23,950
I should make brother-in-law say
'I love you' to me.

1378
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:25,549
I should try hard.

1379
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:28,324
Sita. One and only Sita.

1380
01:21:38,495 --> 01:21:40,709
Brother, you're a
government employee, right?

1381
01:21:41,511 --> 01:21:42,714
Yes, MP sir.

1382
01:21:42,794 --> 01:21:45,219
Is there any compensation
if government employee dies?

1383
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:47,986
Yes, MP sir.
- Is it?

1384
01:21:48,249 --> 01:21:50,450
Why are you still watching?
Go ahead.

1385
01:21:51,827 --> 01:21:55,106
Sir, should I shoot?
- Do you have common sense?

1386
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:59,735
You know my heart skipped beating
with the sound of bullet, right?

1387
01:21:59,908 --> 01:22:01,914
You know I underwent
bypass surgery, right?

1388
01:22:03,803 --> 01:22:05,396
Do it calmly with knife.

1389
01:22:05,476 --> 01:22:09,699
No, sir.. no, sir.
Give me one week's time, sir.

1390
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:11,537
I'll return your money, sir.

1391
01:22:11,764 --> 01:22:14,415
You've fooled me many times.

1392
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:16,457
While asking for loan...

1393
01:22:16,978 --> 01:22:18,949
...you begged me and made me a hero.

1394
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:22,542
You're making me a villain
when I'm asking for money strictly.

1395
01:22:22,902 --> 01:22:24,218
Come with cash.

1396
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:25,979
Else you won't be seen.

1397
01:22:28,375 --> 01:22:29,648
Go without making sound.

1398
01:22:29,728 --> 01:22:32,189
Bypass!
- Thank you, MP sir. Thank you.

1399
01:22:32,269 --> 01:22:34,343
How nice it would have been if we had...

1400
01:22:34,769 --> 01:22:37,503
...fake identity for our health,
similar to our properties.

1401
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:47,432
Hello my brother-in-law
with fake identity.

1402
01:22:48,568 --> 01:22:50,747
Brother-in-law...
- Are you coming just now?

1403
01:22:50,972 --> 01:22:52,105
How is your health, brother-in-law?

1404
01:22:52,185 --> 01:22:54,639
Doctors have assured me
saying there is no danger...

1405
01:22:54,847 --> 01:22:57,623
...to my health when I've a fake person
like you with me.

1406
01:22:57,703 --> 01:23:00,970
Brother-in-law, it is...it is...

1407
01:23:01,342 --> 01:23:03,980
The 10 crores that you gave
for Real estate...

1408
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:06,471
Yes?
- They are locked, brother-in-law.

1409
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:12,826
Brother-in-law,
you have caused Tsunami...

1410
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:14,781
...when I talked about fake identity.

1411
01:23:14,861 --> 01:23:16,450
I trusted a person...

1412
01:23:16,623 --> 01:23:18,595
...and gave him 10 crores,
brother-in-law.

1413
01:23:18,675 --> 01:23:20,947
What did he give you?

1414
01:23:21,795 --> 01:23:25,479
Brother-in-law, it is crores of rupees
and not lakhs to keep quiet.

1415
01:23:25,559 --> 01:23:27,355
I tried every possible way,
brother-in-law.

1416
01:23:27,883 --> 01:23:29,837
He said to do whatever I can.

1417
01:23:30,736 --> 01:23:32,535
I came for you couple of times.

1418
01:23:32,615 --> 01:23:36,496
They told me that you went to Hyderabad
for heart surgery.

1419
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,468
What's his name, brother-in-law?

1420
01:23:38,548 --> 01:23:39,583
Peketi Baburao.

1421
01:23:39,663 --> 01:23:41,944
What does he do?
- He's a civil contractor, brother-in-law.

1422
01:23:42,024 --> 01:23:43,440
Tell me where he stays.

1423
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,352
He stays here in Kakinada.

1424
01:23:45,507 --> 01:23:47,954
At present he went to Pithapuram
on farm work.

1425
01:23:48,034 --> 01:23:49,208
Okay.

1426
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,280
Lord Satyanarayana...

1427
01:23:55,998 --> 01:23:58,947
...I made a vow to come to you
with family.

1428
01:23:59,027 --> 01:24:02,372
Even if I ask them,
they don't seem to come to you.

1429
01:24:02,666 --> 01:24:04,500
I'm unable to fulfill your vow.

1430
01:24:05,111 --> 01:24:06,714
Forgive me, Lord.

1431
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:15,951
Consider these five flowers...

1432
01:24:16,253 --> 01:24:18,701
...as my children
and bless them, Lord.

1433
01:24:28,398 --> 01:24:32,325
See how nice the necklace is,
better than the dress.

1434
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:34,547
Hi uncle. Hi aunt.
- Hi Santosh.

1435
01:24:34,627 --> 01:24:36,277
Hi.
- Hi uncle. - Hi.

1436
01:24:36,357 --> 01:24:37,626
You know something?
- What?

1437
01:24:37,706 --> 01:24:40,247
There's a grand sale of gold-coated
jewellery in Annavaram.

1438
01:24:40,327 --> 01:24:42,704
Rold-gold jewellery?
- No, aunt.

1439
01:24:42,784 --> 01:24:45,056
Gold-coated!
They look similar to real gold.

1440
01:24:45,136 --> 01:24:46,389
What's the difference between both?

1441
01:24:46,469 --> 01:24:48,291
Actually...
- You wait.

1442
01:24:48,492 --> 01:24:52,443
I'll tell. To buy gold...
treasure box gets emptied.

1443
01:24:52,595 --> 01:24:54,940
If you buy rold-gold,
colour fades away in two days.

1444
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:58,261
Oh! - Gold-coated jewellery
looks similar to original gold.

1445
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,462
If I cover up more than this
then our plan will get revealed.

1446
01:25:00,608 --> 01:25:02,836
Why does he talk of cover up and plan?
- The matter is...

1447
01:25:03,008 --> 01:25:04,440
If we get a cover with a proper plan...

1448
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,284
...it will be enough.
Hey, they will get it.

1449
01:25:07,595 --> 01:25:08,501
Oh!

1450
01:25:08,581 --> 01:25:12,743
All aunts are coming,
so if you, sister and uncle come...

1451
01:25:14,563 --> 01:25:16,279
Aunt, your neck looks empty
without any jewellery.

1452
01:25:17,885 --> 01:25:19,755
You look like...

1453
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:21,493
Goddess Laxmi without any jewellery.

1454
01:25:23,797 --> 01:25:24,904
Okay.

1455
01:25:25,407 --> 01:25:27,621
She had fallen.
- You're all going, right?

1456
01:25:27,937 --> 01:25:30,394
What's the need for us?
- You're no ordinary woman.

1457
01:25:30,986 --> 01:25:34,355
Do one thing. Click photos of the
jewellery and send on WhatsApp.

1458
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:37,420
I'll chose from them
and ping you back, you can buy them.

1459
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,178
Okay?
- Why should we delay further? Come.

1460
01:25:41,059 --> 01:25:42,245
Okay, aunt.

1461
01:25:43,069 --> 01:25:44,366
Tit for tat!

1462
01:25:51,459 --> 01:25:54,054
Hey! So we're buying the jewellery
of your aunt's choice.

1463
01:25:54,519 --> 01:25:58,384
No. We'll buy the good ones
and send aunt the bad ones.

1464
01:25:58,464 --> 01:25:59,948
Oh my dear nephew!

1465
01:26:00,028 --> 01:26:01,840
Talk slowly.
Else your aunt might hear us.

1466
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,610
Yes, she might hear us. Let's go.

1467
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:05,374
I'm not such a fool.

1468
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:06,968
Santosh!

1469
01:26:07,726 --> 01:26:08,753
One minute.

1470
01:26:09,312 --> 01:26:10,655
We too will come to Annavaram.

1471
01:26:10,878 --> 01:26:12,019
Why do you take risk?

1472
01:26:17,343 --> 01:26:19,581
Is he a great economist?
- He's guru of all economists.

1473
01:26:19,661 --> 01:26:21,079
Where does he stay?
- Annavaram.

1474
01:26:21,388 --> 01:26:22,486
Lord Satyanarayana.

1475
01:26:22,933 --> 01:26:25,292
Make a vow that you'll donate
some profit from your share.

1476
01:26:25,494 --> 01:26:26,907
Your share values
will increase immediately.

1477
01:26:27,378 --> 01:26:28,660
If not then ask me.
- Is it?

1478
01:26:29,029 --> 01:26:30,407
When should we go?
- Tomorrow.

1479
01:26:30,913 --> 01:26:32,595
Yes, aunt?
- Okay, Santosh. I'll come.

1480
01:26:38,766 --> 01:26:39,871
Colostrums milk.

1481
01:26:50,347 --> 01:26:52,901
I like colostrums milk very much.
I ate it many years ago.

1482
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,018
Uncle, can I ask you something?

1483
01:26:56,536 --> 01:26:59,217
What? - We're facing lot of troubles
for doing the registration, right?

1484
01:27:00,036 --> 01:27:02,643
Grandmother made a vow that she will
visit Annavaram if it happens immediately.

1485
01:27:03,695 --> 01:27:05,958
I told her it is not possible as
Bangalore uncle is very busy...

1486
01:27:06,836 --> 01:27:08,784
...so postpone it.
- Why did you tell her like that?

1487
01:27:08,937 --> 01:27:10,520
Let's go tomorrow if registration
were to happen immediately.

1488
01:27:16,603 --> 01:27:18,850
You make vows, you visit temples,
you gain virtues...

1489
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:20,347
...why should we become sinners?

1490
01:27:21,431 --> 01:27:24,037
We had functions till yesterday
and now we should visit temples?

1491
01:27:24,253 --> 01:27:27,048
Will you come to call us all the time?

1492
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:31,257
Doesn't you and your grandmother
have any other work?

1493
01:27:32,018 --> 01:27:35,408
We can go back and do our work
if our work here is finished.

1494
01:27:36,232 --> 01:27:39,635
You came to enjoy
your summer holidays it seems.

1495
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,603
You and your father are same.

1496
01:27:46,009 --> 01:27:49,429
Tiger lifts it tail
if the ring master is a fool.

1497
01:27:51,987 --> 01:27:53,199
Uncle, should I ask you something?

1498
01:27:53,874 --> 01:27:56,702
You always say that
I and my father are same, right?

1499
01:27:57,073 --> 01:28:00,691
Ever did you get a thought to
become like our grandfather?

1500
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:25,457
Do you still remember this cycle?

1501
01:28:25,944 --> 01:28:27,963
We went to movies on this.

1502
01:28:28,299 --> 01:28:29,548
Correct!
- Greetings.

1503
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:31,160
Greetings. Have it.
- Look...

1504
01:28:31,558 --> 01:28:33,710
Every movie we watched
in childhood...

1505
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:35,132
...would run for 100 years you know.

1506
01:28:35,358 --> 01:28:36,199
That's true!

1507
01:28:37,129 --> 01:28:40,352
You would watch lot of
English movies in childhood.

1508
01:28:40,728 --> 01:28:42,787
I think you married a foreign lady.

1509
01:28:43,123 --> 01:28:45,434
Yes, it's a love marriage.
I'm settling down in US.

1510
01:28:45,514 --> 01:28:46,758
What are you kids studying?

1511
01:28:47,081 --> 01:28:48,463
I didn't plan for kids yet.

1512
01:28:49,264 --> 01:28:50,318
What is it?

1513
01:28:50,447 --> 01:28:53,312
If we settle down well
then they will have good future.

1514
01:28:53,392 --> 01:28:54,300
So I took some time.

1515
01:28:54,472 --> 01:28:55,764
It's quite common there.

1516
01:28:56,238 --> 01:28:57,416
What common!

1517
01:28:57,644 --> 01:29:02,268
Marriage means unison of two lives
to give birth to a new life.

1518
01:29:02,819 --> 01:29:06,908
Nowadays it means to give birth
to a new creature.

1519
01:29:07,296 --> 01:29:08,499
It's the age of Kali.

1520
01:29:08,755 --> 01:29:11,889
Are you happy?
Did you make any property?

1521
01:29:12,554 --> 01:29:15,529
Not many but somewhat.

1522
01:29:15,888 --> 01:29:18,234
Own house and a small vehicle.

1523
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:21,658
There are two more
which are better than these two.

1524
01:29:22,558 --> 01:29:23,962
Kids!
- Yes, father!

1525
01:29:28,507 --> 01:29:31,275
They are my wealth and world.

1526
01:29:31,503 --> 01:29:33,281
I don't realise
how time is spent with them.

1527
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:35,301
What's your name?
- Ravi.

1528
01:29:36,457 --> 01:29:37,868
My name.

1529
01:29:38,359 --> 01:29:40,096
Yes, I gave him your name.

1530
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:45,065
I didn't find a best friend and good name
than you so I gave him your name.

1531
01:29:45,757 --> 01:29:47,895
Where is your mother?
- Mother is inside.

1532
01:29:49,868 --> 01:29:51,915
What is she cooking?

1533
01:29:57,664 --> 01:29:59,940
Bye.
- Hey, eat and go.

1534
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:01,822
I've work, I'll come again.

1535
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:04,126
Bye.
- Bye, uncle.

1536
01:30:04,382 --> 01:30:05,849
Bye, dear.
- Bye, uncle.

1537
01:30:08,107 --> 01:30:09,274
Thanks.

1538
01:30:10,941 --> 01:30:12,401
Thanks for what?
Ravi!

1539
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,529
All these years
I thought happiness lies in earning.

1540
01:30:15,889 --> 01:30:17,971
Children and the love shared with them!

1541
01:30:18,165 --> 01:30:19,943
How couldn't I realise it is in it?

1542
01:30:21,334 --> 01:30:22,662
What a stupid I am!

1543
01:30:35,911 --> 01:30:37,011
Brother-in-law...

1544
01:30:39,315 --> 01:30:42,234
Hey, why did you come at this hour?
- Why will I come at this hour?

1545
01:30:42,553 --> 01:30:45,978
To learn rhymes from you.
- She's drunk.

1546
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:50,405
It won't look good if mother sees.
- Oh! You gave a hint, right?

1547
01:30:50,558 --> 01:30:52,696
Your safety is important. - Thank you.
- Okay.

1548
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:56,265
Be careful.
- Okay...

1549
01:30:58,044 --> 01:30:59,282
Why is she closing the door?

1550
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:04,242
Steady Sita, steady!

1551
01:31:05,412 --> 01:31:07,485
Are you drunk?
- I came by drinking.

1552
01:31:07,565 --> 01:31:09,217
Don't you have brothers?
- No.

1553
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:11,254
She's sloshed.
- Now tell me, brother-in-law.

1554
01:31:11,334 --> 01:31:13,500
You love me, right?

1555
01:31:13,644 --> 01:31:14,784
Me and you?

1556
01:31:14,864 --> 01:31:17,756
Swear on it and say that you don't love me.
- Since when are you drinking?

1557
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:19,600
Okay, I'll believe then.

1558
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,234
On this?
- Yes.

1559
01:31:21,314 --> 01:31:22,180
Will you believe?
- Yes.

1560
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:23,409
I swear on this and say...

1561
01:31:23,489 --> 01:31:25,523
...I don't have any feelings on you.
Okay?

1562
01:31:26,038 --> 01:31:28,444
Go away!
- Brother-in-law, you are caught.

1563
01:31:29,666 --> 01:31:31,840
I'm talking of love...

1564
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,797
...but why are you talking of feelings.

1565
01:31:33,877 --> 01:31:36,144
Anyway,
aren't there girls in Hyderabad?

1566
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:39,248
You want Kakinada girl?
- What's this nuisance?

1567
01:31:39,991 --> 01:31:42,397
Sita, you're very drunk.
Let's go.

1568
01:31:42,812 --> 01:31:44,585
Let's go out.
- Why are you pushing me away?

1569
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:47,309
Why are you afraid like girls?

1570
01:31:47,681 --> 01:31:49,350
Be bold like me.

1571
01:31:50,353 --> 01:31:52,360
You're crossing your limits.
Let's go.

1572
01:31:53,164 --> 01:31:55,421
Come.
- Naughty!

1573
01:31:55,501 --> 01:31:57,263
Mother will come, you leave.

1574
01:31:57,343 --> 01:31:58,683
Please!

1575
01:31:58,916 --> 01:32:01,579
You have it inside, say it...
brother-in-law.

1576
01:32:01,787 --> 01:32:03,604
Go! Hope nobody has seen.

1577
01:32:07,496 --> 01:32:10,722
My God! I must keep beers
and wines inside fridge...

1578
01:32:10,904 --> 01:32:12,452
...and not fruits and vegetables
if I marry her.

1579
01:32:12,532 --> 01:32:14,900
Why didn't brother-in-law get exposed
despite my best acting?

1580
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:16,889
Sita! Boost!

1581
01:32:16,969 --> 01:32:18,151
Coming, mother.

1582
01:32:18,844 --> 01:32:20,193
Ugh!

1583
01:32:21,503 --> 01:32:25,419
Non-stop Annavaram!
It won't stop anywhere. Come and sit!

1584
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:27,197
You're always fast.

1585
01:32:27,391 --> 01:32:30,062
Why are you walking slowly,
English aunt? Come.

1586
01:32:30,142 --> 01:32:31,695
Come on dear.
- Thanks, Ravi.

1587
01:32:31,888 --> 01:32:34,704
Why is your face looking like a kid going
to school on Monday morning?

1588
01:32:35,196 --> 01:32:36,911
It would have been nice
if elder uncle's family too had come.

1589
01:32:37,727 --> 01:32:39,775
I'm unable to fulfill
grandmother's wish. No!

1590
01:32:40,425 --> 01:32:42,155
Wow! Sir...

1591
01:32:42,306 --> 01:32:45,371
You'll come after two days, right?
- We're going to Annavaram.

1592
01:32:45,451 --> 01:32:47,523
Why will it take two days?
We'll return by evening.

1593
01:32:48,534 --> 01:32:49,710
What will you do
if we don't come for two days?

1594
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:52,125
Not that they'll do something,
they shouldn't do anything.

1595
01:32:52,205 --> 01:32:55,030
We won't be there for two days
so they want to have fun.

1596
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:57,816
He doesn't have mind
but reads mind very well.

1597
01:32:57,987 --> 01:32:59,470
What?

1598
01:32:59,703 --> 01:33:02,631
What? What are you thinking of?
You don't have any chance.

1599
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:04,835
Elder uncle's family is there inside,
look after their needs.

1600
01:33:04,915 --> 01:33:07,176
Go!
- Oh God! You don't exist.

1601
01:33:09,004 --> 01:33:11,257
Uncle, you have phone, right?

1602
01:33:12,824 --> 01:33:14,604
Slowly, aunt.
- That's okay.

1603
01:33:14,684 --> 01:33:16,091
Why is it so heavy?
What are you carrying?

1604
01:33:17,003 --> 01:33:18,549
Elder uncle will not come, let's go.

1605
01:33:22,644 --> 01:33:25,629
Hope some miracle takes place
at the last minute.

1606
01:33:25,709 --> 01:33:27,882
Don't feel sad, let's go.

1607
01:33:32,374 --> 01:33:33,482
Right! Right!

1608
01:33:39,509 --> 01:33:41,494
Hey fatty uncle!
Isn't there any entertainment?

1609
01:33:41,844 --> 01:33:44,385
Why is it not there? We'll play songs here,
you go on top and dance.

1610
01:33:44,465 --> 01:33:46,275
Full entertainment!
- So you're first.

1611
01:33:46,528 --> 01:33:49,911
I'm also last. I not fatty uncle
or something. I'm just uncle.

1612
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:51,536
Is there any entertainment or not?

1613
01:33:51,616 --> 01:33:54,242
Don't you understand anything until
I say it twice? You running nose!

1614
01:34:00,582 --> 01:34:02,017
You fool!

1615
01:34:02,242 --> 01:34:04,736
Who has stopped auto
in the middle of the road? Move!

1616
01:34:04,816 --> 01:34:07,166
Why do you talk to him?
Run over the auto.

1617
01:34:08,087 --> 01:34:10,297
Santosh! Come and see.

1618
01:34:27,516 --> 01:34:28,852
We too are coming to temple.

1619
01:34:29,162 --> 01:34:31,775
Our car broke down in between...
move.

1620
01:34:31,979 --> 01:34:33,435
Telling lies.

1621
01:34:33,515 --> 01:34:35,052
Miracle happened!

1622
01:34:36,942 --> 01:34:38,098
High five!

1623
01:34:57,019 --> 01:35:00,800
Lord Satyanarayana,
entire family has come by your grace.

1624
01:35:00,966 --> 01:35:03,197
You've fulfilled your vow by yourself.

1625
01:35:05,594 --> 01:35:08,583
You've proved to be a truthful God.

1626
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:14,439
First chapter of the story.

1627
01:35:14,619 --> 01:35:18,501
Now I'm going to tell
the story of Lord Satyanarayana.

1628
01:35:18,581 --> 01:35:19,931
Listen carefully.

1629
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:21,898
In olden days, in Naimisharan forest...

1630
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:24,604
...sages and ordinary folks
lived happily.

1631
01:35:24,771 --> 01:35:30,216
They asked the Lord presiding there...
as follows.

1632
01:35:30,296 --> 01:35:34,256
Lord, what is the penance to be done...

1633
01:35:46,252 --> 01:35:51,902
...so that humans can...
get their wishes fulfilled.

1634
01:35:51,982 --> 01:35:53,691
Could you please narrate us...

1635
01:35:55,143 --> 01:35:57,353
...and help us live...

1636
01:36:08,936 --> 01:36:11,217
Hey, Sita is winking at you.

1637
01:36:11,659 --> 01:36:12,938
He's seen it.

1638
01:36:13,834 --> 01:36:15,433
You! Say sorry!

1639
01:36:17,412 --> 01:36:20,088
What is that?
- Incense sticks.

1640
01:36:20,235 --> 01:36:22,516
What is it coming from them?
- Smoke.

1641
01:36:22,848 --> 01:36:25,819
Smoke is entering Sita's eyes
and her eye-lids are blinking.

1642
01:36:27,197 --> 01:36:28,861
So what?
- Falling inside the eyes?

1643
01:36:28,994 --> 01:36:31,411
Yes. - Like how windows
make sound in rainy season.

1644
01:36:31,491 --> 01:36:33,080
Exactly!
- Super!

1645
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:37,028
You did a good job.
- What?

1646
01:36:37,255 --> 01:36:38,251
Smoke.

1647
01:36:39,755 --> 01:36:41,118
Idiot seems to have found it.

1648
01:36:43,201 --> 01:36:45,532
Oh! These humans are really...

1649
01:36:45,612 --> 01:36:47,338
Call from office...
- Prayers are going on.

1650
01:36:47,747 --> 01:36:49,124
All of them kept going...

1651
01:36:49,204 --> 01:36:50,342
Look at your dad.

1652
01:36:50,422 --> 01:36:51,761
Prayers are going on...

1653
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:53,995
People are busy with phones
but he's into them all the time.

1654
01:36:54,168 --> 01:36:55,331
Uncle is back to work again.

1655
01:36:56,023 --> 01:36:56,646
Stop!

1656
01:36:56,791 --> 01:36:58,694
End of 5th chapter!

1657
01:37:06,852 --> 01:37:08,512
I couldn't see your marriage.

1658
01:37:08,905 --> 01:37:11,528
I feel like watching your marriage
with these prayers.

1659
01:37:11,782 --> 01:37:13,653
Be happy with kids.

1660
01:37:17,579 --> 01:37:19,727
Even God gives boon only upon asking.

1661
01:37:19,989 --> 01:37:22,110
But you're giving so many boons
to grandmother even without her asking.

1662
01:37:22,345 --> 01:37:23,518
I feel like watching his marriage.

1663
01:37:23,598 --> 01:37:24,709
Yes.

1664
01:37:26,366 --> 01:37:29,767
Touch the feet.
Give my name to your daughter.

1665
01:37:31,162 --> 01:37:32,286
Where is brother, sister-in-law?

1666
01:37:32,366 --> 01:37:35,067
He's attending a phone call.

1667
01:37:35,147 --> 01:37:36,156
He'll be back soon.

1668
01:37:46,051 --> 01:37:46,972
Move aside!

1669
01:37:47,052 --> 01:37:49,394
Brother-in-law, wife should
always stay by her husband, right?

1670
01:37:50,862 --> 01:37:52,473
I think she became mad
after entering the temple.

1671
01:37:52,755 --> 01:37:54,288
Why were you winking at me
during the prayers?

1672
01:37:54,510 --> 01:37:56,021
I didn't do.
- You did.

1673
01:37:56,264 --> 01:37:58,085
I didn't.
- Go away.

1674
01:38:01,654 --> 01:38:03,602
What is this new game? Fresh plan?

1675
01:38:04,156 --> 01:38:05,982
None of it!

1676
01:38:06,586 --> 01:38:08,545
Don't you remember something with this?

1677
01:38:12,077 --> 01:38:13,157
Move aside!

1678
01:38:27,408 --> 01:38:29,588
I gave this teddy bear to you
in childhood, right? - Yes.

1679
01:38:33,589 --> 01:38:36,235
Look Sita, I don't suit for your
attitude and behaviour.

1680
01:38:37,016 --> 01:38:38,820
Leave me.
- Brother-in-law.

1681
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,814
Anyway, you wrote it in letter
in childhood, right?

1682
01:38:42,009 --> 01:38:43,124
I'm repeating the same now.

1683
01:38:50,063 --> 01:38:51,365
Not my vow, PA.

1684
01:38:51,445 --> 01:38:53,322
I came for my daughter's vow.

1685
01:38:53,402 --> 01:38:55,780
I never said no to my daughter.

1686
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:58,826
Sita is the reason
why elder uncle came to temple.

1687
01:39:01,399 --> 01:39:04,654
Later on Mr. Venkatrao called up
and said he'll buy five flats.

1688
01:39:17,247 --> 01:39:19,217
Did you bring elder uncle to the temple?
- Yes.

1689
01:39:19,577 --> 01:39:22,538
Why? - Wherever Santosh is there,
happiness should follow.

1690
01:39:24,836 --> 01:39:27,725
Okay, why didn't you tell me that
you're bringing elder uncle?

1691
01:39:28,041 --> 01:39:30,172
Will you love me only
if I bring your uncle?

1692
01:39:30,321 --> 01:39:31,201
Go away! Roadside stall!

1693
01:39:31,281 --> 01:39:32,529
Sita, please wait a minute.

1694
01:39:33,735 --> 01:39:35,438
I love you, Sita.

1695
01:39:35,518 --> 01:39:38,530
You know something?
Sravya told me everything.

1696
01:39:39,808 --> 01:39:41,043
Is it?

1697
01:39:41,341 --> 01:39:43,551
You idiot! You fooled me again.

1698
01:39:44,065 --> 01:39:45,471
I love you so much, brother-in-law.

1699
01:39:45,551 --> 01:39:46,395
I love you.

1700
01:39:50,541 --> 01:39:53,636
Hold on! Grandmother's house has come!
Get down!

1701
01:39:56,116 --> 01:39:58,158
112 packets to eat today.

1702
01:39:59,071 --> 01:40:00,926
Did you bring the offering?

1703
01:40:01,368 --> 01:40:03,792
Didn't you eat food
so that you can eat offering?

1704
01:40:03,941 --> 01:40:06,277
Don't throw punches.
- I've already distributed them.

1705
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:09,278
Only this is left. Lick it.
- What is this?

1706
01:40:09,358 --> 01:40:10,462
You're wonderful!

1707
01:40:19,048 --> 01:40:20,509
Get down.

1708
01:40:20,769 --> 01:40:21,854
Be careful.

1709
01:40:21,934 --> 01:40:23,171
What?

1710
01:40:23,251 --> 01:40:25,717
Brother, what about real estate...
- Let's go to the village meeting.

1711
01:40:25,797 --> 01:40:26,901
Meeting?

1712
01:40:27,897 --> 01:40:29,242
What's the need to go there now, uncle?

1713
01:40:29,569 --> 01:40:32,447
I spoke to all the village elders,
they're all coming there.

1714
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:34,257
They are telling us to come.
Suryarao is also coming.

1715
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:40,672
Okay, brother.
Let's decide something today. Let's go.

1716
01:40:40,752 --> 01:40:42,449
Where to go?

1717
01:40:42,621 --> 01:40:45,820
The other day you created a ruckus
in secret meeting. That was enough.

1718
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:47,785
No, brother...
- No, dear.

1719
01:40:47,865 --> 01:40:51,583
This is what happens if women
are given power. They spoil everything.

1720
01:40:51,663 --> 01:40:53,731
Men will go. Come guys.
- Okay.

1721
01:40:53,877 --> 01:40:55,214
Decide something today.

1722
01:40:55,294 --> 01:40:57,473
It's been two week
since our shop is shut.

1723
01:40:57,553 --> 01:40:58,934
Okay, okay. Come.

1724
01:40:59,629 --> 01:41:01,292
Why are you watching with a blank face?

1725
01:41:01,372 --> 01:41:02,415
Come.
- Don't scold in front of everyone.

1726
01:41:02,897 --> 01:41:04,190
Come.
- No.

1727
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:07,466
Don't know what grandfather Suryarao
will talk. I'm feeling tensed.

1728
01:41:08,214 --> 01:41:09,856
You don't feel tensed,
nothing will happen.

1729
01:41:14,832 --> 01:41:15,912
Hello!

1730
01:41:16,559 --> 01:41:19,560
The other day you said you will
decide at Registrar office, right?

1731
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:21,010
Why don't you talk now?

1732
01:41:23,893 --> 01:41:24,991
Ask 20 acres.

1733
01:41:26,655 --> 01:41:27,998
What? 20 acres?

1734
01:41:28,670 --> 01:41:30,937
You folks will not agree.
- That's why I told him to ask.

1735
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:33,293
Yes.
- Mr. President.

1736
01:41:34,111 --> 01:41:37,434
I looked after their fields till now.

1737
01:41:38,121 --> 01:41:40,550
I never cheated them anytime.

1738
01:41:41,491 --> 01:41:45,041
What's there to ask?
Tell them to give 20 acres.

1739
01:41:45,267 --> 01:41:46,361
I'll manage.

1740
01:41:47,264 --> 01:41:49,372
Is it?
- Mr. Baburao.

1741
01:41:49,452 --> 01:41:51,333
You don't get angry,
wait for some time.

1742
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:54,353
Look Suryarao,
your demand is not good.

1743
01:41:54,433 --> 01:41:55,585
Ask something else.

1744
01:41:58,277 --> 01:41:59,432
Ask 50 lakhs.

1745
01:42:00,964 --> 01:42:03,125
Speak up, Suryarao.
What are you thinking?

1746
01:42:03,462 --> 01:42:07,129
Sir, if they find it difficult
to give the fields...

1747
01:42:08,621 --> 01:42:10,374
...tell them to give 50 lakhs cash.

1748
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:13,394
50 lakhs?

1749
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:17,401
You worked for us all these years
and now giving us trouble.

1750
01:42:18,296 --> 01:42:20,474
50 lakhs.
- That's great!

1751
01:42:22,742 --> 01:42:25,185
Okay, we will arrange 50 lakhs.

1752
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:26,434
We will do the registration tomorrow.

1753
01:42:29,471 --> 01:42:31,482
Suryarao, are you happy?

1754
01:42:31,795 --> 01:42:33,048
Let there be no dispute in future?

1755
01:42:33,774 --> 01:42:37,073
They said they will give what
you asked for. This is the final word.

1756
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:47,568
Everything is finished.
Registration tomorrow.

1757
01:42:47,989 --> 01:42:49,087
They will go back.

1758
01:42:51,213 --> 01:42:53,568
Registration should be done
tomorrow at any cost.

1759
01:42:53,648 --> 01:42:54,500
Why should we wait till tomorrow?

1760
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,092
Matter will be settled
if we give it today itself.

1761
01:42:56,327 --> 01:42:57,868
I think 50 lakhs is a good deal.

1762
01:42:59,357 --> 01:43:01,889
You want money? Tell me how much.
- Keep it.

1763
01:43:03,058 --> 01:43:04,737
Keep your money in your pocket.

1764
01:43:04,918 --> 01:43:07,035
This matter won't get settled
with money.

1765
01:43:07,469 --> 01:43:09,749
Yes. What very good deal, uncle?

1766
01:43:11,445 --> 01:43:13,225
He said no to money
at registrar office.

1767
01:43:13,305 --> 01:43:14,682
He asked for 20 acres at meeting.

1768
01:43:14,979 --> 01:43:16,869
He agreed for 50 lakhs
within half an hour.

1769
01:43:17,108 --> 01:43:18,551
If we wait for another two days...

1770
01:43:18,631 --> 01:43:20,624
he will say 20.
If we wait for four days...

1771
01:43:20,704 --> 01:43:23,625
He will say 10. - But I think
this process will take time, uncle.

1772
01:43:23,793 --> 01:43:25,702
I feel 50 lakhs is the best deal.

1773
01:43:26,308 --> 01:43:28,101
I don't think so.
Anyway, it's late.

1774
01:43:28,181 --> 01:43:30,541
Let's wait for another few days.
Why should we give him so much money?

1775
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,746
What do you say, brother?
- Yes, uncle.

1776
01:43:31,826 --> 01:43:34,907
How can he fix the rate
when the fields belong to us?

1777
01:43:36,957 --> 01:43:39,845
Uncle, should I talk to
elder uncle once?

1778
01:43:40,951 --> 01:43:42,098
Let's go.

1779
01:43:42,709 --> 01:43:44,564
Brother, come here.

1780
01:43:45,002 --> 01:43:45,958
One minute.
- Okay.

1781
01:43:46,038 --> 01:43:47,840
50 lakhs is too much, brother.
- Hey.

1782
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:50,466
We can get rid of it with 50 lakhs.
Why should we continue further?

1783
01:43:50,953 --> 01:43:53,694
Brother, we both don't like
to give 50 lakhs.

1784
01:43:53,774 --> 01:43:56,521
You too think. We'll deal differently
after few days.

1785
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:59,485
Anyway fields belong to us.
Why is he fixing the rate?

1786
01:44:01,597 --> 01:44:04,454
True, it's more, right?
- Yes.

1787
01:44:05,052 --> 01:44:06,524
It didn't strike me.

1788
01:44:06,604 --> 01:44:09,856
Let's wait further.
- Baburao sir, any problem?

1789
01:44:09,936 --> 01:44:13,837
No...it's a big amount...

1790
01:44:14,091 --> 01:44:16,504
We'll discuss with the women
of the family and let you know.

1791
01:44:19,378 --> 01:44:21,051
Greetings.
- Baburao sir...

1792
01:44:21,131 --> 01:44:22,676
What happened to him?
- Let's go.

1793
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:25,426
Leave immediately.

1794
01:44:37,225 --> 01:44:39,798
Sister, this dispute is not
getting settled.

1795
01:44:40,047 --> 01:44:41,255
It would have been good
if it got settled soon.

1796
01:44:41,335 --> 01:44:42,181
We can go to our place.

1797
01:44:42,261 --> 01:44:43,863
Janaki!
- Yes.

1798
01:44:44,054 --> 01:44:46,388
Please come here.
- Okay.

1799
01:44:46,728 --> 01:44:49,093
Keep Santosh's clothes
inside the cupboard.

1800
01:44:50,670 --> 01:44:52,436
Janaki!
- Yes, mother.

1801
01:45:09,407 --> 01:45:10,488
My necklace.

1802
01:45:11,179 --> 01:45:12,356
How come it is in his cupboard?

1803
01:45:13,232 --> 01:45:15,134
Didn't he give it to me
after finding it inside the dung?

1804
01:45:19,885 --> 01:45:21,789
Why didn't you give me the necklace
after you found it?

1805
01:45:22,759 --> 01:45:24,773
Tell me why you hide it.
- Aunt, I didn't hide it.

1806
01:45:25,017 --> 01:45:27,501
I kept it away from me.
Yes, I'm asking why.

1807
01:45:27,872 --> 01:45:29,865
I'm checking whether rack's value
would increase or not if I keep it inside.

1808
01:45:30,361 --> 01:45:31,774
What?
- Yes, aunt.

1809
01:45:31,915 --> 01:45:34,218
You give importance to people
who wear jewellery.

1810
01:45:34,771 --> 01:45:37,574
You didn't wear necklace all these days.
Did you become any less important?

1811
01:45:37,884 --> 01:45:39,544
Will your importance increases
if you wear it now?

1812
01:45:39,726 --> 01:45:41,497
Aunt, I'm not saying not to value gold.

1813
01:45:42,024 --> 01:45:44,300
Between gold and silver,
we'll choose gold to be important.

1814
01:45:44,614 --> 01:45:47,536
If asked to choose between gold and
humans, we need to choose only humans.

1815
01:45:48,598 --> 01:45:50,254
Aunt, I could have told this
when necklace was found.

1816
01:45:50,732 --> 01:45:52,145
But you were not in a position
to listen then.

1817
01:45:53,265 --> 01:45:56,440
Grandmother gave you bangles and you
tested them to find if its gold or not.

1818
01:45:57,445 --> 01:46:00,067
Had grandmother learnt about it
then she would have definitely felt sad.

1819
01:46:01,258 --> 01:46:02,799
Aunt, you would have lost your respect.

1820
01:46:04,106 --> 01:46:07,431
Grandmother gave you gold
for not to make you look pretty.

1821
01:46:07,511 --> 01:46:08,875
She wanted you to feel happy
by seeing it.

1822
01:46:15,226 --> 01:46:16,753
I run a local general store.

1823
01:46:17,059 --> 01:46:18,475
I had cheap thoughts in mind.

1824
01:46:19,338 --> 01:46:20,804
Commodities have prices.

1825
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:26,559
But I've understood that
humans have values.

1826
01:46:27,423 --> 01:46:28,911
It is not sufficient to possess
10 grams of gold.

1827
01:46:31,307 --> 01:46:33,573
I've learnt that our attitude
should be similar to gold.

1828
01:46:36,192 --> 01:46:37,582
Forgive me, Santosh.

1829
01:46:37,843 --> 01:46:39,265
Stop it, aunt.

1830
01:46:43,062 --> 01:46:44,103
Thanks.

1831
01:46:49,828 --> 01:46:51,436
It will calve in two hours.

1832
01:46:52,038 --> 01:46:54,155
I'll go and check Sundaramma's cow
in the neighbourhood.

1833
01:46:54,235 --> 01:46:55,483
Okay.
- Hello.

1834
01:46:55,563 --> 01:46:56,595
Hello.
- Hello!

1835
01:46:56,764 --> 01:46:58,265
Ramana!
- Hello!

1836
01:46:59,266 --> 01:47:00,678
I'm better than this doctor.

1837
01:47:00,966 --> 01:47:02,733
Shut up!
- Who is that guy?

1838
01:47:02,897 --> 01:47:04,810
Do we need a doctor for calving?

1839
01:47:05,049 --> 01:47:06,333
I'll do it if you tell me.

1840
01:47:06,413 --> 01:47:07,896
What will you do?
- What will I do?

1841
01:47:07,976 --> 01:47:09,756
I'm similar to a doctor.

1842
01:47:09,986 --> 01:47:12,373
It was good that I failed Bi.P.C.

1843
01:47:12,453 --> 01:47:14,313
Else I too would have become a doctor.

1844
01:47:14,393 --> 01:47:15,996
How will you do it?
- Why do you ask like that?

1845
01:47:16,076 --> 01:47:18,812
Like humans, animals also
have a body language.

1846
01:47:18,892 --> 01:47:21,309
Hell with you! You don't know the
language but talking of body language.

1847
01:47:21,389 --> 01:47:22,921
Hey, listen to me!

1848
01:47:23,253 --> 01:47:24,737
Doing hypnotism to humans...

1849
01:47:24,817 --> 01:47:26,331
What was that?
- Hypnotism.

1850
01:47:26,411 --> 01:47:28,824
Huh?
- Got it?

1851
01:47:29,019 --> 01:47:30,223
I won't forget it now.

1852
01:47:30,705 --> 01:47:32,751
We take control of them with it...

1853
01:47:32,831 --> 01:47:34,945
...we can do the same thing on animals
and bring them under our control.

1854
01:47:35,148 --> 01:47:37,260
This is called understanding therapy.

1855
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:39,177
Is it?
- I'll do it now, you watch.

1856
01:47:39,531 --> 01:47:41,692
Watch carefully and learn.

1857
01:47:43,494 --> 01:47:44,796
Critical operation!

1858
01:47:45,456 --> 01:47:46,691
Don't bat your eye-lid.

1859
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:59,996
Don't turn your face. Look here.

1860
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:01,683
Turn towards me.

1861
01:48:02,232 --> 01:48:03,981
Look into my eyes.

1862
01:48:07,479 --> 01:48:08,630
Don't move.

1863
01:48:09,351 --> 01:48:10,489
Turn your face.

1864
01:48:11,915 --> 01:48:13,022
Look at me.

1865
01:48:14,939 --> 01:48:17,431
Relax! Don't feel tensed with me.

1866
01:48:18,702 --> 01:48:20,597
Be cool! Got it?

1867
01:48:23,529 --> 01:48:24,552
Yes!

1868
01:48:24,862 --> 01:48:25,916
Now you are there.

1869
01:48:26,173 --> 01:48:27,669
Just start the operation.

1870
01:48:28,214 --> 01:48:30,077
Please co-operate and understand.

1871
01:48:32,924 --> 01:48:34,651
Buffalo will get frightened.

1872
01:48:34,797 --> 01:48:37,135
You don't threaten me unnecessarily.
Go back.

1873
01:48:37,254 --> 01:48:38,389
Observe what is happening.

1874
01:48:43,968 --> 01:48:44,938
Come on!

1875
01:48:47,373 --> 01:48:49,140
Come on! Come on!

1876
01:48:49,543 --> 01:48:50,659
Come on!

1877
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:56,457
Come on!
- Is this our therapy?

1878
01:48:56,537 --> 01:48:58,277
Come on! Come on!

1879
01:49:01,427 --> 01:49:02,479
Ugh!

1880
01:49:02,728 --> 01:49:03,996
Why do you say like that?

1881
01:49:04,076 --> 01:49:05,839
Poison comes first.

1882
01:49:05,919 --> 01:49:08,596
See what happens now.
Look at there. Come on!

1883
01:49:08,723 --> 01:49:10,832
You should assist the cow to calve,
not bull.

1884
01:49:12,819 --> 01:49:14,103
You've insulted me.

1885
01:49:14,183 --> 01:49:15,972
Hey, come, come.

1886
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:20,442
What did I tell you and what
are you doing? Your work will be done.

1887
01:49:20,989 --> 01:49:23,168
Do some antics. Okay?

1888
01:49:23,248 --> 01:49:25,092
I'm there, I will save your child.

1889
01:49:25,172 --> 01:49:26,780
I'll also give a good name.
God bless you.

1890
01:49:27,817 --> 01:49:29,145
Gods must be crazy.

1891
01:49:29,339 --> 01:49:31,560
Hey, see the calf now.

1892
01:49:33,028 --> 01:49:34,218
Hey! You proceed!

1893
01:49:35,229 --> 01:49:37,235
I didn't ask for dung.

1894
01:49:37,315 --> 01:49:38,432
Calf! Calf!
Come on!

1895
01:49:40,321 --> 01:49:41,324
You!

1896
01:49:54,414 --> 01:49:55,653
Bangalore uncle?

1897
01:49:56,518 --> 01:49:58,981
Ugh! I think this cow didn't empty
its bowel from two days.

1898
01:49:59,195 --> 01:50:01,402
Bangalore uncle laughed for the
first time and the cow got frightened.

1899
01:50:01,648 --> 01:50:03,257
Dung on his face!

1900
01:50:05,851 --> 01:50:08,757
Uncle...
- I laughed after so many years.

1901
01:50:09,054 --> 01:50:10,584
I laughed suddenly...

1902
01:50:11,268 --> 01:50:12,549
Uncle, I remember well...

1903
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:15,136
...that you laughed and made everyone
laugh in childhood.

1904
01:50:15,718 --> 01:50:18,326
Uncle, by leaving your laugh...

1905
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:21,558
...why did you get disconnected
from family.

1906
01:50:22,513 --> 01:50:25,308
Yes, I used to laugh
and make everyone laugh once.

1907
01:50:26,009 --> 01:50:29,240
Staff in office wouldn't work
when I made them laugh.

1908
01:50:29,690 --> 01:50:31,170
I would then talk with anger
and they would work.

1909
01:50:32,484 --> 01:50:34,097
I stopped laughing after that.

1910
01:50:35,889 --> 01:50:37,197
Tension increased in life.

1911
01:50:38,109 --> 01:50:39,922
Interest on family became less.

1912
01:50:40,786 --> 01:50:42,371
After many years...

1913
01:50:43,021 --> 01:50:45,118
...you brought back my laugh.

1914
01:50:47,237 --> 01:50:48,427
Thanks a lot.

1915
01:50:48,793 --> 01:50:53,152
If we leave the tensions from office
outside the house...

1916
01:50:54,771 --> 01:50:57,083
...then we don't need
to give up laughing.

1917
01:50:57,463 --> 01:50:59,477
Photos are beautiful
if we laugh for a second.

1918
01:50:59,649 --> 01:51:00,805
Only one life, uncle.

1919
01:51:01,102 --> 01:51:02,811
How beautiful it will be
if we spend it with laugh.

1920
01:51:03,441 --> 01:51:07,322
Don't know when your father
names you as Santosh...

1921
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:11,342
...laughter and joy can be seen
in your face.

1922
01:51:11,422 --> 01:51:14,836
Smile exists inside everyone,
it's there in this village and also house.

1923
01:51:15,956 --> 01:51:19,575
Show your laugh to your family
and everyone.

1924
01:51:27,297 --> 01:51:28,515
Santosh.
- Yes.

1925
01:51:29,975 --> 01:51:33,407
You brought the smile
from t-shirt to my face.

1926
01:51:33,967 --> 01:51:36,562
I'll never let it go away.
Promise.

1927
01:51:39,087 --> 01:51:40,208
Uncle..

1928
01:51:49,141 --> 01:51:50,294
Keerthi...

1929
01:51:54,781 --> 01:51:55,908
For you, dear.

1930
01:52:02,067 --> 01:52:03,174
For you my darling!

1931
01:52:06,143 --> 01:52:08,779
I bought earrings long
back for you.

1932
01:52:09,589 --> 01:52:11,062
I couldn't find time so this delay.

1933
01:52:12,038 --> 01:52:14,367
Your grandmother got it done.

1934
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:17,172
I couldn't even attend the function
though I was here only.

1935
01:52:18,771 --> 01:52:19,947
Hope you forgive me.

1936
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:24,112
Take it, dear.

1937
01:52:27,031 --> 01:52:28,180
Thank you, daddy.

1938
01:52:33,798 --> 01:52:35,908
Are you happy now?

1939
01:52:38,281 --> 01:52:39,395
Ravi.
- Yes.

1940
01:52:40,295 --> 01:52:42,231
Brother, what brings you here?

1941
01:52:42,993 --> 01:52:44,507
Any work?
- Yes.

1942
01:52:45,061 --> 01:52:48,153
You need to forgive me
and I need to bless you.

1943
01:52:49,931 --> 01:52:51,859
I couldn't attend your wedding
with the excuse of distance.

1944
01:52:52,124 --> 01:52:53,923
I couldn't see your celebrations.

1945
01:52:54,858 --> 01:52:57,314
Sorry.
- No need to say sorry, brother.

1946
01:52:57,480 --> 01:53:01,265
I wish to bless you now
if you don't mind.

1947
01:53:02,047 --> 01:53:03,292
Sandra.
- Yes.

1948
01:53:07,097 --> 01:53:08,432
God bless you!

1949
01:53:11,310 --> 01:53:14,196
How could you live so far
when you have so much love inside?

1950
01:53:15,296 --> 01:53:17,129
Uncle, shall I ask you a small matter?

1951
01:53:17,787 --> 01:53:22,089
You would buy t-shirts and give money
to US uncle in my childhood, right?

1952
01:53:26,519 --> 01:53:27,695
Yes.

1953
01:53:28,892 --> 01:53:31,114
My father would give him money
to buy clothes.

1954
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:33,335
He would watch movies
with that money.

1955
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:38,260
I used to buy him clothes because your
grandfather would scold him if he knew it.

1956
01:53:39,489 --> 01:53:44,596
Uncle, in spite of knowing it you would go
to movie as if you knew nothing, right?

1957
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:46,772
Yes.

1958
01:53:47,688 --> 01:53:51,827
Brother, don't know whether it became
a habit or not but even today...

1959
01:53:51,907 --> 01:53:53,900
...I don't find satisfaction in the
clothes that I purchase myself.

1960
01:54:03,097 --> 01:54:04,759
I feel like giving even now too.

1961
01:54:17,719 --> 01:54:19,355
How does he remember everything?

1962
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:22,368
Uncle, everything related to this house
is a sweet memory to me.

1963
01:54:23,392 --> 01:54:25,003
Should I tell you a small logic?

1964
01:54:26,233 --> 01:54:27,679
I'm too born in this house.

1965
01:54:34,983 --> 01:54:39,490
'All varieties of food items...'

1966
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:41,260
'Hot...'

1967
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:42,679
Can't stop laughing.
- Yes.

1968
01:54:42,759 --> 01:54:45,989
'Fritters, Mysore fritters.'

1969
01:54:46,069 --> 01:54:47,625
'Chilli fritters.'

1970
01:54:47,705 --> 01:54:49,449
Kalamandir. Andhra Pradesh.

1971
01:54:49,746 --> 01:54:52,260
We can spend entire life by watching
Mr. Jandhyala's movies.

1972
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:54,637
True.
- In this life filled with tension...

1973
01:54:54,717 --> 01:54:56,570
...it is very difficult to laugh.

1974
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:58,502
In our childhood...

1975
01:54:59,177 --> 01:55:01,718
...we were very happy
without any tensions.

1976
01:55:01,907 --> 01:55:03,624
How nice it would be
if those days come back!

1977
01:55:03,704 --> 01:55:05,556
How nice it would be
if we could get into a time-machine...

1978
01:55:05,636 --> 01:55:09,853
...and go back to happy days
by turning on a switch, right?

1979
01:55:09,933 --> 01:55:13,425
Those days eating,
studying, watching movies...

1980
01:55:13,505 --> 01:55:15,189
...talking with friends.

1981
01:55:15,269 --> 01:55:17,696
Those days are different.
Now it is not possible.

1982
01:55:17,869 --> 01:55:19,031
It is possible.

1983
01:55:22,145 --> 01:55:23,408
Where there is a will, there is a way.

1984
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:27,697
Sir, we have our own minds...

1985
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,937
...tell us the solution, sir.

1986
01:55:31,159 --> 01:55:33,762
We can be happy anywhere
and anytime.

1987
01:55:34,371 --> 01:55:37,498
People of any age can be happy.
- Tell so that we understand.

1988
01:55:38,176 --> 01:55:40,231
Lock your age.
- Lock?

1989
01:55:41,381 --> 01:55:42,618
Your...

1990
01:55:43,638 --> 01:55:46,319
Age.
- Is it a new software?

1991
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:47,600
I think it's an app.

1992
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:48,907
It is neither a software not an app.

1993
01:55:48,987 --> 01:55:51,241
This game is invented by Santosh
to keep people happy.

1994
01:55:51,321 --> 01:55:52,374
Made in Pithapuram.

1995
01:55:53,447 --> 01:55:55,315
This game is not played
by some machine.

1996
01:55:55,747 --> 01:55:57,070
It is played with human minds.

1997
01:55:59,527 --> 01:56:00,651
Lock your age means...

1998
01:56:00,867 --> 01:56:02,779
We must have been happy previously.

1999
01:56:03,168 --> 01:56:06,221
Bring that situation
and paste it in present.

2000
01:56:06,301 --> 01:56:07,458
That is lock your age.

2001
01:56:08,141 --> 01:56:09,672
From ages to cooking...

2002
01:56:09,854 --> 01:56:11,531
...whatever you liked earlier,
do it now.

2003
01:56:11,611 --> 01:56:13,667
This concept is good.
- Nice idea.

2004
01:56:13,747 --> 01:56:16,107
Let's apply it.
We all want to be happy.

2005
01:56:16,676 --> 01:56:19,712
But is it possible practically.

2006
01:56:19,792 --> 01:56:21,278
Yes, aunt. Can I prove now?

2007
01:56:21,494 --> 01:56:23,085
Okay.
- Okay.

2008
01:56:23,258 --> 01:56:24,893
Ready! Let's start the game.

2009
01:56:26,268 --> 01:56:28,128
With whom we will start?
- Who else?

2010
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:31,545
Youngest daughter of this house,
the golden lady of this house...

2011
01:56:31,709 --> 01:56:32,955
Aunt Bangaram.

2012
01:56:33,663 --> 01:56:36,517
No, please!
- Aunt, start it.

2013
01:56:36,915 --> 01:56:38,118
Please! Come on!

2014
01:56:38,697 --> 01:56:39,934
'My lock your age'...

2015
01:56:40,366 --> 01:56:42,183
...is the day when I decked up
like a bride.

2016
01:56:47,294 --> 01:56:49,542
My joy knew no bounds those days.

2017
01:56:52,846 --> 01:56:56,825
Wore lot of jewellery, black spot
on cheeks and vermillion on forehead...

2018
01:56:58,036 --> 01:57:01,131
Is it, aunt?
You like girl from earlier days itself?

2019
01:57:01,408 --> 01:57:05,334
Not only from that time, during
the time of 'Annaprasam' day...

2020
01:57:05,516 --> 01:57:07,686
...she went on touched gold first.

2021
01:57:09,554 --> 01:57:13,775
How nice it would be
if I could stay like bride forever!

2022
01:57:14,787 --> 01:57:16,844
Wearing jewellery like that...

2023
01:57:16,924 --> 01:57:19,499
...and watching myself in the mirror...

2024
01:57:19,957 --> 01:57:24,181
...I wouldn't feel hungry or get sleep.
I felt very happy.

2025
01:57:27,388 --> 01:57:29,533
Aunt Bangaram,
your 'lock your age'.

2026
01:58:01,416 --> 01:58:03,215
Mother, give your jewellery too.

2027
01:58:03,857 --> 01:58:06,410
Look at sister,
she looks like a golden doll. Right?

2028
01:58:06,548 --> 01:58:08,873
Yes.
- In greed of gold...

2029
01:58:09,676 --> 01:58:11,177
I got separated...

2030
01:58:11,433 --> 01:58:13,737
...from such sweet people
for so many years.

2031
01:58:13,817 --> 01:58:15,494
Forgive me.
- Get up, dear.

2032
01:58:15,778 --> 01:58:16,961
Don't cry.

2033
01:58:25,423 --> 01:58:28,045
Sister.
- Why are you crying like a small girl?

2034
01:58:28,709 --> 01:58:30,543
Calm down!
Calm down I say.

2035
01:58:37,011 --> 01:58:38,948
So aunt Bangaram,
whenever you want to be happy...

2036
01:58:39,028 --> 01:58:40,300
...apply 'lock your age'.

2037
01:58:42,193 --> 01:58:45,057
Now the king of our house.
Eldest uncle.

2038
01:58:49,797 --> 01:58:52,039
My God! What will he do now?

2039
01:58:53,678 --> 01:58:54,847
Is it, dear?

2040
01:58:56,929 --> 01:59:00,811
It's my age, my mind and my wish.
Why should I lock as you say?

2041
01:59:01,648 --> 01:59:05,266
Lock your age?
You and your useless games.

2042
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,692
He won't change.

2043
01:59:12,498 --> 01:59:13,618
No, no.

2044
01:59:15,286 --> 01:59:17,341
Aunt, now tell your 'lock your age'.

2045
01:59:17,421 --> 01:59:19,797
My happiest days are those...

2046
01:59:20,337 --> 01:59:21,534
...which I spent with my brothers.

2047
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:24,730
Mostly on Rakhi festival.

2048
01:59:25,318 --> 01:59:27,317
Elder brother would give some gift.

2049
01:59:27,774 --> 01:59:30,127
Second brother
would give jokes book.

2050
01:59:31,027 --> 01:59:33,427
But he didn't know what to give...

2051
01:59:33,614 --> 01:59:36,744
...he would tie thread to grass flowers
and gave it as bouquet.

2052
01:59:41,162 --> 01:59:45,555
First time when my brother
called me as sister...

2053
01:59:47,576 --> 01:59:49,125
...the happiness I felt...

2054
01:59:50,454 --> 01:59:53,069
...I didn't experience it even
when my son called me as mother.

2055
02:00:08,823 --> 02:00:10,933
Mother made me cry with sentiment.

2056
02:00:12,055 --> 02:00:13,175
Your concept is great.

2057
02:00:15,368 --> 02:00:18,068
So now the one and only...
US uncle.

2058
02:00:18,282 --> 02:00:21,202
My 'lock your age'
is my Intermediate days.

2059
02:00:21,721 --> 02:00:23,720
We started on bicycle at Pithapuram...

2060
02:00:24,101 --> 02:00:26,785
...and stopped directly in Kakinada
at Saytyagouri theatre.

2061
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,684
I wouldn't remember the steps
in maths formula...

2062
02:00:29,881 --> 02:00:31,566
...but the steps of Chiranjeevi...

2063
02:00:31,646 --> 02:00:32,694
I remembered them perfectly.

2064
02:00:35,814 --> 02:00:38,474
One incident
I cannot forget in my life.

2065
02:00:38,754 --> 02:00:41,273
Once while returning after watching
Chiranjeevi's 'Gharanamogudu' movie..

2066
02:00:41,605 --> 02:00:43,293
Principle sir! Let's go.

2067
02:00:43,373 --> 02:00:44,622
Hey! Stop!

2068
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:46,441
Good morning... good morning, sir.

2069
02:00:46,642 --> 02:00:49,493
How was the movie?
- Sir, I'll...

2070
02:00:49,659 --> 02:00:51,866
You are watching movies back to back.

2071
02:00:52,198 --> 02:00:54,834
You are giving proxy attendance.

2072
02:00:55,132 --> 02:00:58,239
Go home. Your father will show you
a good action movie.

2073
02:00:58,432 --> 02:01:01,283
Move aside! - Sir...
- Useless fellow!

2074
02:01:03,041 --> 02:01:04,445
I thought I was finished that day...

2075
02:01:05,262 --> 02:01:06,950
Father would remove my skin
if he found out.

2076
02:01:07,275 --> 02:01:08,632
I wanted to run away to some place.

2077
02:01:08,860 --> 02:01:10,756
But I didn't have enough courage
to escape by leaving everyone.

2078
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,555
I came home with lot of fear.

2079
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:14,382
Thief is caught.

2080
02:01:17,128 --> 02:01:18,422
What did grandfather say?

2081
02:01:18,657 --> 02:01:19,376
What will he say?

2082
02:01:19,456 --> 02:01:21,453
He must have beat him black and blue.
Yes, uncle?

2083
02:01:31,728 --> 02:01:33,360
Ravi...
- Father...

2084
02:01:39,229 --> 02:01:40,516
Why are you afraid?

2085
02:01:40,952 --> 02:01:42,363
You're studying all the time.

2086
02:01:43,076 --> 02:01:44,799
Sometimes go to movies.

2087
02:01:45,435 --> 02:01:46,853
Take this money and go for movie.

2088
02:01:47,663 --> 02:01:48,825
Mad boy!

2089
02:01:50,701 --> 02:01:54,001
I still don't understand
why father behaved like that.

2090
02:01:58,414 --> 02:02:00,033
Grandmother,
you must have cast some spell.

2091
02:02:00,724 --> 02:02:01,859
Tell what happened.

2092
02:02:01,939 --> 02:02:04,688
Grandmother,
we should know it right now. Yes!

2093
02:02:06,971 --> 02:02:11,461
Listen, your younger son is bunking
classes and watching movies.

2094
02:02:12,142 --> 02:02:14,012
He is studying well.

2095
02:02:14,092 --> 02:02:17,828
He studied all night
so I only told him to go for movie.

2096
02:02:18,541 --> 02:02:22,141
Don't know if you are aware or not,
our priest checked his horoscope...

2097
02:02:22,379 --> 02:02:25,806
...and said he alone is lucky enough
to go to America from our family.

2098
02:02:25,978 --> 02:02:27,524
Don't say anything to him.

2099
02:02:35,169 --> 02:02:37,157
I know the concept of
'Lock your age'.

2100
02:02:37,330 --> 02:02:40,659
Now I'll watch every movie
that gets released in US.

2101
02:02:42,378 --> 02:02:43,838
Now the king of Bangalore.

2102
02:02:44,789 --> 02:02:45,805
Bangalore uncle!

2103
02:02:45,885 --> 02:02:48,973
Will he tell us directly
or take everyone into conference call?

2104
02:02:49,053 --> 02:02:51,427
Fatty! - Yes.
- I'll hit you with cell phone.

2105
02:02:51,507 --> 02:02:54,151
I got it, uncle. Continue.
- My 'lock your age' time.

2106
02:02:55,028 --> 02:02:56,325
8th class.

2107
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:01,168
I loved mother very much.
I was always behind her.

2108
02:03:05,421 --> 02:03:07,242
Tomorrow is my daughter's
baby shower ceremony.

2109
02:03:07,322 --> 02:03:09,319
Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi,
you should definitely attend.

2110
02:03:09,399 --> 02:03:11,308
Okay.
- Come without fail.

2111
02:03:11,388 --> 02:03:14,022
Okay. - Greetings.
- Greetings.

2112
02:03:15,114 --> 02:03:16,174
Mother.
- Yes?

2113
02:03:16,254 --> 02:03:17,795
What is baby shower ceremony?

2114
02:03:18,606 --> 02:03:20,034
Their daughter...
- Yes.

2115
02:03:20,114 --> 02:03:21,980
...is going to give birth to a boy or girl.
- Okay.

2116
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:23,926
That's why they are celebrating
baby shower ceremony.

2117
02:03:26,779 --> 02:03:30,088
Then baby shower ceremony
should take place in our house too.

2118
02:03:30,168 --> 02:03:34,265
Why?
- Our bull is going to calve in few days.

2119
02:03:35,742 --> 02:03:38,228
How come bull birth to a calf?
This is strange!

2120
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:40,152
Though it was a small matter...

2121
02:03:40,444 --> 02:03:41,958
...she would think wisely.

2122
02:03:52,174 --> 02:03:53,795
Are you happy now?

2123
02:03:54,022 --> 02:03:56,066
I'm very happy, mother.

2124
02:03:56,146 --> 02:04:00,438
I entered history books for conducting
baby shower ceremony to an animal.

2125
02:04:06,094 --> 02:04:08,196
Now the princess of Pithapuram.

2126
02:04:08,490 --> 02:04:09,770
Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi.

2127
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:16,205
Grandmother's 'lock your age' must
have been from our childhood days.

2128
02:04:16,861 --> 02:04:18,764
No, no, it must be
during her young age.

2129
02:04:19,110 --> 02:04:20,797
No, it must be after marriage.

2130
02:04:20,987 --> 02:04:22,129
Isn't it, grandmother?

2131
02:04:22,665 --> 02:04:24,317
Stop your options.

2132
02:04:24,611 --> 02:04:25,753
Grandmother, you tell.

2133
02:04:31,727 --> 02:04:33,061
In my life...

2134
02:04:34,134 --> 02:04:35,656
...real happiness...

2135
02:04:37,238 --> 02:04:39,132
...was when I saw you all...

2136
02:04:40,247 --> 02:04:43,785
...after 20 years in front of me.

2137
02:04:55,130 --> 02:04:59,022
Grandmother is the key person
behind all our 'lock our age' concept.

2138
02:04:59,334 --> 02:05:01,185
One selfie from these celebrations.

2139
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:02,724
Super!

2140
02:05:03,494 --> 02:05:06,002
Smile!
- Click!

2141
02:05:06,322 --> 02:05:08,346
Who is laughing inside?

2142
02:05:08,426 --> 02:05:09,938
Yes! Aunt, come this side.

2143
02:05:10,448 --> 02:05:11,590
Hi!

2144
02:05:13,779 --> 02:05:14,937
I'm very happy.

2145
02:05:16,165 --> 02:05:17,791
Be like this always.

2146
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:25,463
I think there is some point
in the concept he talked about.

2147
02:05:26,561 --> 02:05:28,585
Let's test it and see.
What will I lose?

2148
02:06:46,827 --> 02:06:48,024
I'll tie! I'll tie!

2149
02:06:48,104 --> 02:06:49,248
Ready?

2150
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:52,970
There! Here!

2151
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:54,174
There!
- Sister!

2152
02:06:54,254 --> 02:06:55,800
Here!

2153
02:06:56,291 --> 02:06:57,924
Right! Right!

2154
02:06:58,004 --> 02:06:59,736
Catch!

2155
02:10:15,982 --> 02:10:17,616
I'm very happy. All have changed.

2156
02:10:17,696 --> 02:10:19,683
I can see that happiness in your face.
- Elder uncle too has changed.

2157
02:10:19,763 --> 02:10:20,954
But he is not showing it outside.

2158
02:10:26,774 --> 02:10:29,144
I didn't slap you for stopping
the registration.

2159
02:10:30,069 --> 02:10:34,202
For not telling us that registration
was done 20 years ago.

2160
02:10:36,703 --> 02:10:38,925
Registration was done 20 years ago?

2161
02:10:39,695 --> 02:10:40,958
Yes.

2162
02:10:41,875 --> 02:10:43,578
I think everyone knows the matter.

2163
02:10:46,442 --> 02:10:50,593
They got attracted towards you
like a magnet.

2164
02:10:51,406 --> 02:10:55,030
They don't know that
you are going to fool them.

2165
02:10:56,830 --> 02:10:59,061
Aunt... please, aunt.

2166
02:10:59,485 --> 02:11:01,145
Aunt... please...please.

2167
02:11:01,448 --> 02:11:02,823
One day, aunt.

2168
02:11:03,056 --> 02:11:04,985
Aunt? Get in.
- Uncle.

2169
02:11:05,790 --> 02:11:07,658
Uncle, at least you tell.

2170
02:11:07,738 --> 02:11:10,374
It is okay if you don't make us laugh.

2171
02:11:11,257 --> 02:11:12,641
It is not good to make us cry.

2172
02:11:20,140 --> 02:11:21,594
Uncle, one day...

2173
02:11:21,775 --> 02:11:23,436
Please, uncle.
- I didn't expect you to do this.

2174
02:11:23,773 --> 02:11:24,906
Shame on you!

2175
02:11:33,079 --> 02:11:35,734
Uncle! Please, uncle!
Stay for one day.

2176
02:11:35,814 --> 02:11:37,593
After that I'll never enter
this house anytime.

2177
02:11:37,948 --> 02:11:39,808
Swear on me! Please, uncle.

2178
02:11:40,232 --> 02:11:41,884
Please!
- Why one day?

2179
02:11:42,325 --> 02:11:43,839
So you want to usurp
the entire property...

2180
02:11:43,919 --> 02:11:45,447
...after killing us
if we stay for another day?

2181
02:11:59,987 --> 02:12:03,645
You've learnt very well from your
father as how to ruin others dreams.

2182
02:12:04,371 --> 02:12:06,793
After all you and your father are same.

2183
02:12:51,032 --> 02:12:52,236
Why are you feeling sad?

2184
02:12:52,852 --> 02:12:55,038
Forgive me, grandmother.
- Why should I forgive you?

2185
02:12:59,370 --> 02:13:02,075
Since I told you that I want to
spend few days with everyone...

2186
02:13:02,455 --> 02:13:04,226
...that you went to everyone
and got insulted.

2187
02:13:04,409 --> 02:13:05,538
Should I forgive for that?

2188
02:13:06,712 --> 02:13:08,450
My second daughter is fond of gold...

2189
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:11,843
...and you searched her necklace...

2190
02:13:12,081 --> 02:13:13,752
...inside the dung.

2191
02:13:14,339 --> 02:13:15,579
Should I forgive you for that?

2192
02:13:18,707 --> 02:13:21,568
My second son ignored
his wife and children...

2193
02:13:21,917 --> 02:13:24,109
...but you made him love his family.

2194
02:13:25,371 --> 02:13:27,330
How many should I tell?

2195
02:13:27,867 --> 02:13:29,926
I said I made a vow to God.

2196
02:13:30,652 --> 02:13:33,536
You not only took everyone
to Annavaram...

2197
02:13:33,907 --> 02:13:38,268
...and made me watch
my third son's marriage again.

2198
02:13:38,971 --> 02:13:42,549
For a person to be happy
property is not needed...

2199
02:13:43,046 --> 02:13:45,135
...but memories and experiences.

2200
02:13:45,295 --> 02:13:47,066
You said it in English.

2201
02:13:49,121 --> 02:13:52,686
You took everyone 20 years back.

2202
02:13:53,302 --> 02:13:59,239
But you took my 100 years ahead.

2203
02:14:03,377 --> 02:14:08,765
For making you win by hiding
you behind me in your childhood.

2204
02:14:09,821 --> 02:14:11,871
You are standing in front of me now...

2205
02:14:11,951 --> 02:14:14,449
...and gave me lot of happiness.

2206
02:14:20,866 --> 02:14:24,170
Why did you do it for me?

2207
02:14:27,491 --> 02:14:28,712
In childhood, summer holidays...

2208
02:14:28,792 --> 02:14:30,657
...Dussehra holidays
and Sankranthi holidays...

2209
02:14:31,210 --> 02:14:33,485
...are meant to spend at grandmother's
house, I felt happy for it.

2210
02:14:34,082 --> 02:14:36,253
But I used to feel very sad...

2211
02:14:36,522 --> 02:14:38,137
...that I couldn't visit
grandmother's house.

2212
02:14:39,936 --> 02:14:41,683
Grandmother means love.

2213
02:14:41,968 --> 02:14:43,499
Father means respect.

2214
02:14:43,793 --> 02:14:47,097
My life got crushed
between these two for 20 years.

2215
02:14:48,456 --> 02:14:51,422
That's why I came to this village
by searching for happiness.

2216
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:55,772
Grandmother, it is enough
if you are there for me, I can be happy.

2217
02:14:56,559 --> 02:14:57,892
But for you to be happy...

2218
02:14:59,976 --> 02:15:01,611
...I had learnt that
they all are needed.

2219
02:15:05,071 --> 02:15:07,250
That's why I made them stay
for 20 days.

2220
02:15:10,208 --> 02:15:12,724
Grandmother,
how did everyone come to know...

2221
02:15:12,804 --> 02:15:14,618
...that registration was already done.
- Just now...

2222
02:15:15,062 --> 02:15:16,815
Suryarao came.

2223
02:15:17,022 --> 02:15:18,130
Greetings, madam.

2224
02:15:21,512 --> 02:15:22,886
Please listen to me once.

2225
02:15:22,966 --> 02:15:25,285
Registration of fields
was done 20 years back.

2226
02:15:28,015 --> 02:15:30,196
Sir came to me a day before
he passed away.

2227
02:15:30,413 --> 02:15:32,255
He gave me the registration papers
and left.

2228
02:15:33,846 --> 02:15:36,043
He said if your children
find out about registration...

2229
02:15:36,242 --> 02:15:38,040
...then they will make you an orphan.

2230
02:15:38,343 --> 02:15:39,917
So he told me not to tell you.

2231
02:15:42,625 --> 02:15:46,992
He told me to give these papers
when you all are happy.

2232
02:15:48,619 --> 02:15:51,801
I came and saw the other day,
you all were very happy.

2233
02:15:52,190 --> 02:15:54,387
That's why I came to give
these papers, madam.

2234
02:15:58,192 --> 02:15:59,774
Did he think so greatly...

2235
02:16:01,305 --> 02:16:03,450
...20 years back?

2236
02:16:03,675 --> 02:16:05,716
Your grandson made me do all this.

2237
02:16:07,783 --> 02:16:10,291
Take it, son.
- What is it, grandfather?

2238
02:16:10,785 --> 02:16:13,995
Property registration
was done 20 years back.

2239
02:16:14,811 --> 02:16:16,575
Grandfather did it when he was alive.

2240
02:16:17,005 --> 02:16:19,558
Grandfather, if family members find out
that registration is done...

2241
02:16:19,910 --> 02:16:21,813
...then they will leave right now.

2242
02:16:22,879 --> 02:16:24,352
Keep these papers with you.

2243
02:16:28,476 --> 02:16:30,372
Madam, forgive me...

2244
02:16:30,932 --> 02:16:32,413
...for giving you trouble
all these years.

2245
02:16:32,822 --> 02:16:34,890
It's okay, Suryarao.
- Greetings, madam.

2246
02:16:34,970 --> 02:16:36,032
Greetings.

2247
02:16:52,699 --> 02:16:54,748
Grandmother, had everyone stayed for one
more day then it would have been nice.

2248
02:16:55,204 --> 02:16:58,428
Enough!
You made everyone stay for 20 days.

2249
02:16:58,629 --> 02:17:01,258
You gave me lot of happiness.

2250
02:17:01,530 --> 02:17:03,861
Now I'm at peace.

2251
02:17:04,901 --> 02:17:06,153
Forgive me, grandmother.

2252
02:17:06,374 --> 02:17:07,813
It would have been nice
had they stayed for one day.

2253
02:17:07,893 --> 02:17:09,003
Why?

2254
02:17:09,653 --> 02:17:11,383
Tomorrow is grandfather's
death anniversary.

2255
02:17:23,768 --> 02:17:26,452
You fulfilled so many wishes
without my asking.

2256
02:17:29,176 --> 02:17:31,899
Will you fulfil one last wish?

2257
02:17:32,363 --> 02:17:33,487
What is it, grandmother?

2258
02:17:35,999 --> 02:17:38,434
You conduct my funeral rites.

2259
02:17:39,629 --> 02:17:40,852
Stop it, mother.

2260
02:17:46,791 --> 02:17:47,931
Calm down!

2261
02:17:52,874 --> 02:17:56,471
I'm not sad that you didn't tell me that
registration was done 20 years back.

2262
02:17:57,661 --> 02:17:59,377
Santosh, now I'm telling you.

2263
02:17:59,655 --> 02:18:00,939
You're 100 percent gold.

2264
02:18:01,669 --> 02:18:02,865
100 percent gold.

2265
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:07,277
I love you. It is enough if every
grandmother has a grandson like you.

2266
02:18:07,357 --> 02:18:08,551
It is enough if there is one like you.

2267
02:18:22,643 --> 02:18:26,313
Sita! Your father became A1 contractor.

2268
02:18:26,545 --> 02:18:28,449
Nobody can stop. That's it!

2269
02:18:31,383 --> 02:18:32,517
What is it?

2270
02:18:33,403 --> 02:18:35,174
Who is putting fences in our fields?

2271
02:18:38,645 --> 02:18:41,373
Hey! Who are you?

2272
02:18:42,088 --> 02:18:44,368
Who are you?
- Your best friend.

2273
02:18:45,513 --> 02:18:47,600
You told me to go
and tell anybody, right?

2274
02:18:47,782 --> 02:18:49,758
He is my boss.
- MP sir?

2275
02:18:50,057 --> 02:18:51,646
Sir, you should save me.

2276
02:18:51,862 --> 02:18:54,413
Hey! - Sir?
- Round up him...

2277
02:18:54,602 --> 02:18:56,533
...and then put fences in his fields.

2278
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:03,480
Dear!

2279
02:19:13,875 --> 02:19:15,840
Let's sit and watch.
- Okay, brother-in-law.

2280
02:19:22,438 --> 02:19:24,569
Hey! Don't make sound.

2281
02:19:24,845 --> 02:19:28,142
Finish off Peketi Baburao
with a knife.

2282
02:19:28,354 --> 02:19:29,705
Okay, sir.

2283
02:20:10,550 --> 02:20:12,877
Who is he?
- Don't know, brother-in-law.

2284
02:20:12,957 --> 02:20:14,996
What are you watching here?
You too go.

2285
02:21:15,665 --> 02:21:18,747
Hello son! Stop it.

2286
02:21:19,292 --> 02:21:20,935
I don't know who you are.

2287
02:21:21,126 --> 02:21:25,018
He didn't pay me 10 crores so...

2288
02:21:25,260 --> 02:21:26,445
...I'm getting him thrashed.

2289
02:21:26,981 --> 02:21:29,437
Why are you beating my boys?

2290
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:32,040
I don't know what your matter is...

2291
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:34,920
...but I'll not keep quiet if something
happens to my uncle in front of me.

2292
02:21:37,420 --> 02:21:39,652
Peketi Baburao is your uncle!

2293
02:21:40,326 --> 02:21:44,391
Not for me. I'm a heart patient.
- Stop the car.

2294
02:21:47,046 --> 02:21:49,935
I thought of finishing the work
without causing sound pollution.

2295
02:21:50,610 --> 02:21:52,763
But to handle you...

2296
02:21:53,343 --> 02:21:54,969
...I have to hold the gun.

2297
02:21:55,661 --> 02:21:57,295
For your kind information...

2298
02:21:57,719 --> 02:21:59,016
With silencer.

2299
02:22:01,507 --> 02:22:03,609
Who is he showing his back to me?

2300
02:22:08,460 --> 02:22:12,412
Brother-in-law,
Baburao seems to have many fans.

2301
02:22:12,585 --> 02:22:16,278
Look, first kill him
and then others will fall in life.

2302
02:22:17,835 --> 02:22:19,963
My God! What brother-in-law?

2303
02:22:20,170 --> 02:22:21,658
Why did you beat me like that?

2304
02:22:24,558 --> 02:22:27,288
I went around the world with this heart.

2305
02:22:28,058 --> 02:22:30,151
All doctors gave up.

2306
02:22:30,974 --> 02:22:32,617
But you came forward...

2307
02:22:33,032 --> 02:22:35,575
...and saved my life
by taking huge risk.

2308
02:22:36,570 --> 02:22:38,620
How should I repay your favour, doctor?

2309
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:40,584
There isn't anything to repay in this.

2310
02:22:41,042 --> 02:22:44,476
I did my duty, that's it.
MP sir, you just relax.

2311
02:22:44,900 --> 02:22:48,930
Take this blank cheque and write
as much as you want. Please!

2312
02:22:50,348 --> 02:22:53,634
MP sir, I told you that
I did my duty, that's it.

2313
02:22:53,714 --> 02:22:55,208
Okay, bye.

2314
02:22:58,927 --> 02:23:01,020
Doctor sir, how come you are here?

2315
02:23:01,314 --> 02:23:02,577
Yes, MP sir.

2316
02:23:05,137 --> 02:23:06,270
He is my brother-in-law.

2317
02:23:06,547 --> 02:23:08,891
Sorry, doctor. Hey...

2318
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:11,130
I'm sparing your life because of doctor.

2319
02:23:12,272 --> 02:23:14,649
That boy behind you...

2320
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:17,563
He's my son.
- Sorry, son.

2321
02:23:18,437 --> 02:23:20,037
He's taken after you.

2322
02:23:20,695 --> 02:23:23,151
He is always first in saving his people.

2323
02:23:23,809 --> 02:23:26,101
Don't ever do this stupid work.

2324
02:23:26,181 --> 02:23:27,493
Live a honest life.

2325
02:23:28,808 --> 02:23:31,472
Doctor sir, thank you.
- That's okay. - Thank you, son.

2326
02:23:31,998 --> 02:23:32,858
Brother-in-law.
- Yes?

2327
02:23:32,938 --> 02:23:34,498
What about the 10 crores....

2328
02:23:35,130 --> 02:23:38,140
Hey, I'm alive today...

2329
02:23:38,425 --> 02:23:41,790
...and my family is happy,
it is all because of this doctor.

2330
02:23:41,870 --> 02:23:44,738
Forget the 10 crores.
- I'll follow you.

2331
02:23:50,990 --> 02:23:53,490
Forgive me, brother-in-law.
- Stop it, brother-in-law.

2332
02:23:53,663 --> 02:23:54,969
No formalities between us.

2333
02:23:58,109 --> 02:23:59,805
I used to scold him every day.

2334
02:24:02,330 --> 02:24:04,700
He tolerated me. I beat him too.

2335
02:24:06,602 --> 02:24:08,358
But still he came to save me.

2336
02:24:11,437 --> 02:24:13,452
I knew that you value
relationships but...

2337
02:24:15,140 --> 02:24:17,336
...I couldn't realize that
you could sacrifice your life.

2338
02:24:23,278 --> 02:24:25,128
You and your father are same.

2339
02:24:25,966 --> 02:24:27,100
Same!

2340
02:24:28,145 --> 02:24:29,702
Let's go home, brother-in-law.

2341
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:32,470
Come.
- Come.

2342
02:24:47,098 --> 02:24:49,270
Wait a minute.
- Yes, daddy.

2343
02:24:54,072 --> 02:24:56,694
I'll ask you something.
You won't say no, right?

2344
02:24:56,943 --> 02:24:58,908
Daddy, I'll say yes
even before you ask.

2345
02:24:59,088 --> 02:25:00,527
My sweet girl!

2346
02:25:03,184 --> 02:25:04,395
I mean...

2347
02:25:05,031 --> 02:25:08,262
You...you should marry
your brother-in-law.

2348
02:25:12,642 --> 02:25:15,749
Him? He is not fit to run
a roadside stall!

2349
02:25:15,829 --> 02:25:18,848
No, no.
I know you both don't get along.

2350
02:25:18,987 --> 02:25:21,139
But you should marry him. Please!

2351
02:25:21,305 --> 02:25:23,249
I don't know what you will do.
You should marry brother-in-law.

2352
02:25:23,408 --> 02:25:24,508
Please! Please!

2353
02:25:24,930 --> 02:25:26,964
Don't say no.
- Okay.

2354
02:25:27,044 --> 02:25:28,866
I agree because of you.

2355
02:25:29,081 --> 02:25:30,319
Oh!

2356
02:25:30,950 --> 02:25:32,334
Thanks, dear.
Thanks!

2357
02:25:33,220 --> 02:25:34,422
Lord Satyanarayana!

2358
02:25:36,331 --> 02:25:39,159
She's doing over action.
- She's very happy.

2359
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:43,041
Sister...

2360
02:25:45,701 --> 02:25:46,930
Forgive me, sister.

2361
02:25:48,352 --> 02:25:49,869
Brother...

2362
02:25:50,572 --> 02:25:54,286
I forgot everything
when you called me as sister.

2363
02:25:54,879 --> 02:25:56,318
What's there to forgive?

2364
02:26:02,069 --> 02:26:03,071
What happened?

2365
02:26:03,151 --> 02:26:04,029
Nothing, mother.

2366
02:26:04,109 --> 02:26:05,989
Dear, bring first-aid box.

2367
02:26:06,069 --> 02:26:07,019
Quick!

2368
02:26:08,657 --> 02:26:10,511
I wouldn't have survived
without my brother-in-law...

2369
02:26:10,999 --> 02:26:12,283
...and nephew today.

2370
02:26:20,049 --> 02:26:21,133
Mother!

2371
02:26:29,724 --> 02:26:30,962
I'm calling you, mother.

2372
02:26:34,468 --> 02:26:35,807
I called you, mother.

2373
02:26:43,382 --> 02:26:44,517
Yourself!

2374
02:26:46,250 --> 02:26:47,390
Mother...

2375
02:26:50,098 --> 02:26:51,304
Forgive me, brother.

2376
02:26:52,267 --> 02:26:54,702
Forgive me.
- Calm down! Calm down!

2377
02:27:02,572 --> 02:27:03,661
Mother...

2378
02:27:05,489 --> 02:27:09,673
Do you have sunnundalu (Andhra snacks)?
- Yes, I have.

2379
02:27:14,442 --> 02:27:17,050
Forgive me, aunt.
I trouble you for 20 years.

2380
02:27:17,383 --> 02:27:19,105
Hey, don't say like that.

2381
02:27:19,814 --> 02:27:20,965
Come inside.

2382
02:27:26,116 --> 02:27:27,608
Mother!
- Mother!

2383
02:27:33,015 --> 02:27:35,889
We couldn't go by leaving
this love behind.

2384
02:27:37,532 --> 02:27:41,123
Mother, I wish to stay with you
for few more days.

2385
02:27:46,282 --> 02:27:48,310
Why are you standing there?

2386
02:27:49,424 --> 02:27:51,693
Come! Come!
- Mother!

2387
02:28:00,427 --> 02:28:01,728
Come! Come!

2388
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:03,665
Come.

2389
02:28:23,989 --> 02:28:27,297
Finally his soul is at peace
after 20 years.

2390
02:28:27,543 --> 02:28:30,152
Yes. - What else can make you
happier than this.

2391
02:28:30,335 --> 02:28:31,471
True.

2392
02:28:35,006 --> 02:28:36,984
Hey roadside stall!
When are we getting married?

2393
02:28:37,064 --> 02:28:39,601
Are you an angel?
Forget the marriage! Go away!

2394
02:28:49,882 --> 02:28:51,860
No, don't run it off.

2395
02:28:52,044 --> 02:28:54,541
You brought my five children to me.

2396
02:28:54,866 --> 02:28:56,639
Let it remain as your memory.

2397
02:29:01,158 --> 02:29:04,153
As we expected,
this grandson took initiative...

2398
02:29:04,233 --> 02:29:07,645
...in bringing back the happiness
lost by grandmother for 20 years...

2399
02:29:07,725 --> 02:29:10,304
...in 20 days and made grandmother win.

2400
02:29:10,531 --> 02:29:12,980
By the way, are you also going to...

2401
02:29:13,060 --> 02:29:14,931
...your grandmother's house
during summer holidays?

2402
02:29:15,011 --> 02:29:17,536
If you are not going
then at least go now.

2403
02:29:17,709 --> 02:29:19,817
Just lock your age.

2404
02:29:20,077 --> 02:29:21,579
After our house...

2405
02:29:21,659 --> 02:29:26,236
...the only house
which we can call as ours.

2406
02:29:27,569 --> 02:29:29,201
'Grandmother's house'.

2407
02:29:42,303 --> 02:29:43,342
Tell me, officer.

2408
02:29:43,422 --> 02:29:45,547
Why didn't you come yet?
- I will not come now.

2409
02:29:45,627 --> 02:29:47,988
Why?
- I've learnt few things.

2410
02:29:48,068 --> 02:29:49,185
What is that?

2411
02:29:49,265 --> 02:29:52,049
Our hunger gets quenched
if we drink water...

2412
02:29:52,631 --> 02:29:56,174
...but our thirst won't get quenched
if we eat food, I've learnt this.

2413
02:29:56,254 --> 02:29:58,042
What about your A1 position?

2414
02:29:58,122 --> 02:30:00,724
Forget the position and project.
Hang up!

2415
02:30:00,804 --> 02:30:02,194
Nonsense!

2416
02:30:13,278 --> 02:30:14,235
Action!

2417
02:30:17,866 --> 02:30:18,853
Like this...

2418
02:30:23,197 --> 02:30:24,586
Continue! Raju!

2419
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:39,971
Agreement?

2420
02:31:23,609 --> 02:31:25,263
Cut it! Ready.

2421
02:31:27,069 --> 02:31:28,236
Dialogue is over.

2422
02:31:28,690 --> 02:31:30,420
What is that?

2423
02:31:31,627 --> 02:31:32,621
Cut it! Superb!
